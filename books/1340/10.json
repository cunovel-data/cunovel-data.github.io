{"id":33835,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X. STRUGGLE.","content":"Robert Streightley slept but little on the night after his visit to Middlemeads; for that note which he had found awaiting him from Mr. Guyon sat heavy on his soul. Wanted to see him on particular business, eh? What did that particular business mean? Not more money advances, surely? Such transactions as he had had with Mr. Guyon were small enough to a man accustomed to the particular kind of business, the loans and contracts and subsidies, with which the firm of Streightley and Son were in the habit of dealing; but yet Robert, however wilfully blind, could not shut his eyes to the fact that he had already supplied Mr. Guyon with loans for which he had nothing like adequate security. Could Mr. Guyon possibly mean to touch upon that other subject, which, as a man of the world, he must have already divined lay very close at Robert Streightley\u0027s heart? Could he intend to broach the question of his daughter----? As the idea crossed Streightley\u0027s mind he felt his cheek flush, and the cold beads of perspiration start out upon his forehead. For he was an honourable man, brought up in an honourable school, where \"a fair fight and no favour\" had been the motto from time immemorial, and where any one taking undue advantage or seeking to compass his ends by unfair means toward his rival would have been scouted with ignominy. And he felt--how could he but feel?--that the struggle in which he was at that moment engaged was scarcely being conducted in the same open manner. He felt that he was creeping up towards the assault under the protection of a hireling guerilla force, which, with all the advantage of the knowledge of the ground, was pushing its renegade advantage, furthering his advance here, throwing out earthworks for the hindrance of the enemy there, and all from the mere sordid love of gain and chances of plunder, but without the smallest heartiness of feeling in the matter. Not a nice feeling for a man of Robert Streightley\u0027s sense of punctilio. It galled him, and he chafed against it sadly during the long watches of that night. What was it? a caprice, a sudden fancy, a madness which had stung him,--that he, a mature man of confirmed bachelor habits, with his own household gods around him, and his own life completely settled and hitherto sufficient, should suddenly break through all his customs--yes, that would be nothing, but break through them in a weak and feeble manner--break through them in a way in which he, so far as he read it to himself, took no active part, but suffered himself to be the mere tool and instrument--for his own purposes indeed--in hands which were certainly not exempt from suspicion of being soiled. This was bad, very bad indeed. What should he say to himself suppose a parallel case in the business world--that world which he understood, which had hitherto been his sole life, and out of which he felt he could not with safety emerge--had been submitted to him? Why, he would have declared that, as a point of honour, a man in that position ought at once to set himself free from such trammels. And if in business, surely in love there was all the more reason for his doing so. For his part he would hesitate no longer; he would at once drop the Guyon acquaintance, sinking the advances which he had up to that point made to Mr. Guyon, and writing them off as salutary experience lightly paid for, and---- And then, as he lay tossing on his fevered pillow, rose before him a vision of Katharine in all her grace and beauty--Katharine saucily laughing at Mr. Mostyn\u0027s solemn vanity; Katharine the cynosure of all at the Botanical promenade, queening it amongst the loveliest and the best-bred, evoking admiration from all; Katharine with earnest face and downcast eyes, then with flushed cheek and sparkling glance, in conversation with Gordon Frere--No! that last thought was too much. In Robert Streightley\u0027s nature there lay hitherto latent an amount of mad, blinding, unreasoning jealousy, whose existence was suspected by none of his friends, by him least of all; but it leapt into flame as this last picture crossed his mind, and all thoughts of withdrawal from the career in which he had suffered himself to be embarked shrivelled up before its scorching heat. It should not be from want of perseverance on his part, nor from want of employment of all the resources at his command, that he would fail in this the--yes, the really first scheme in his life in which he had taken hearty interest. He would need all his skill, and tact, and patience to carry it through--ah if he could only sleep now--if he could only forget for an instant those haunting eyes, that queenly form, that sweet winning smile! He lay awake during all the early hours of that morning; and it was nearly five o\u0027clock before he sunk into a heavy, unrefreshing slumber, from which, despite old Alice\u0027s repeated warnings, he did not wake until long past nine. Then he had his bath and dressed himself, and went slouching down to breakfast with pale face and red eyelids, and a wearied anxious look. Mrs. Streightley had ere this sallied forth armed with a complete library of little red books, over which she waged weekly warfare with the neighbouring tradespeople; and Ellen had an \"early service\" on, followed by a little light recreation of district-visiting and a small interlude of first meeting Of coal and flannel fund; so that Robert had only his old nurse to watch over him at breakfast, and render every mouthful additionally distasteful by her comments. \"Well, Lord knows I never thought to have lived to have seen this day,\" said the old woman, when Robert, after a vain attempt at eating, pushed his plate away from before him--\"that any child of your father\u0027s, let alone you, for whom he thought, and cared, and slaved most, should have quarrelled with the victuals provided for him in this house, I didn\u0027t expect.\" \"Ah, nurse!\" said Robert, trying to smile, \"it\u0027s not what\u0027s provided--I\u0027m not well just now, somehow--I----\" \"Not well, indeed! I know what\u0027s the matter with you. You\u0027re in love, and pleased with ruin as the saying is,--that\u0027s what ails you. O, don\u0027t frown and look so; do you think the old woman don\u0027t know those signs, Robert, my boy? No appetite, and looking a long way off, and never speaking when spoke to? Lor\u0027 bless yer. And do you think old Alice don\u0027t know what that means? Come, they\u0027re all out, Robert! tell me who it is. Tell the old woman who nursed you when you couldn\u0027t speak, or scarce cry, for the matter of that, you was that weak; and the doctor never thought to have brought you through it, and wouldn\u0027t if it hadn\u0027t been for me, though I say it as shouldn\u0027t; tell old Alice all about it, deary; tell her and trust her, as you used to--O, so long ago.\" \"There\u0027s nothing to tell, Alice,\" said Robert with a forced laugh, rising from his chair; \"you\u0027ve made a pretty story for yourself, nurse, but I\u0027m too old now to be amused at it even, much less to think of taking one of the characters. I\u0027m a little overdone with business, that\u0027s all.\" \"Is it?\" said the old woman shortly. \"Well,--if it\u0027s business, that\u0027s all right. But it\u0027s the first time since ever I\u0027ve been connected with the house of Streightley and Son, and that\u0027s nigh fifty year, that I heard it was necessary to forward the business of the house, or to captivate the brokers and the shipping-agents and that like, by dressing oneself up in fal-lal clothes, and by dancing attendance at opera and play houses (I found the papers of them in your pockets) until all hours in the morning. And I\u0027m thinking that if that is the way, your father made but a poor hand at it, Master Robert; and it\u0027s a great mercy that he didn\u0027t ruin the whole concern.\" And so saying, and with a sniff of great meaning, the old lady retired from the room. By no means reassured or made more comfortable even by this short interview--for he was a nervous man in some things and very much disliked what he called \"being upset\"--Robert Streightley pushed the breakfast things away from him, and started off for town. He had dropped the omnibus long since, and took a cab as a matter of course; and as he journeyed along he could not help contrasting the splendour of the house he had yesterday visited with the meanness of that one which he had just left. Both were his own, and both were to a certain extent typical of his life: in the latter with frugal commonplace people his money had been made; in the former with one bright being it should be spent. Yes; he had had enough of this daily grind of business, this sordid strife; and he had determined that henceforth--if his hopes were realised--he would live a different life. If his hopes were realised? what forbade their realisation? This man,--this Gordon Frere, was younger it is true, better-looking, more of a \"lady\u0027s man\" than he; but he himself was not so old, not so hideous, not so--Ah! good God! What a fool he was for arguing the question in this way, even to himself! He felt that he loved this girl, and that on that deep love and earnest devotion alone must he rely for the success of his suit. He found Mr. Guyon awaiting him in the dining-room, with the Morning Post on the very verge of the table; and a large blotting-book, a portentous inkstand, and a perfect armoury of steel pens close in front of him. The flavour of Turkish tobacco hung round the apartment, and a cut-glass goblet containing the remains of a draught that looked suspiciously like brandy and soda-water stood on the velvet mantelpiece. Mr. Guyon himself, dressed in the loose lounging jacket and the Turkish trousers, lay on the sofa with the butt-end of a cigarette in his mouth, and extended his hand to his friend in cordial greeting. \"I take this doosid kind of you, my dear Streightley, coming round in this way when I asked you. Doosid kind!\" said Mr. Guyon; \"and I show my appreciation of it by receiving you without the least ceremony or the least humbug--which is the greater compliment. When one says to a fellow, \u0027I want to see you on a matter of business,\u0027 the fellow who\u0027s good enough to come round naturally expects to see the fellow who sent for him in a state of business--stiff shirt-collar, and almanac, and all that kind of thing. That\u0027s what I myself should do to some fellows; but I don\u0027t to you. I say to myself, \u0027He\u0027s above all that sort of dodgery. He\u0027s a real man of business, and would see through it at once. Let him take me as I am. I\u0027m an idle, nothing-doing, pleasure-seeking son of a gun: he knows it; why should I attempt to disguise my natural self from him and prove myself to be somebody else? Let him see me as my natural self.\" Here Mr. Guyon paused for an instant to take a sip from the cut-glass goblet and to throw away the butt-end of the cigarette. Feeling it incumbent on him to say something, Robert Streightley murmured, \"Very kind!\" \"No,\" said Mr. Guyon, raising himself on his elbow, and looking lazily across the table at his visitor, \"not very kind. Shrewd, perhaps, but not kind. When a man is in want of serious advice, and goes to the fountain-head for--that kind of thing--boldly and without scruple, he may be said to be shrewd. Now, that\u0027s my case; and I come to you.\" This, so far, was so like the commencement of Mr. Guyon\u0027s conversations when loans were in question that Streightley had made up his mind that more money was required; he changed his opinion, however, as his host proceeded. \"Now, my dear Robert,--you\u0027ll forgive an old fellow\u0027s familiarity, won\u0027t you? I don\u0027t often indulge in a fancy, but when I do I\u0027m like the--ivy, damme, I cling. You can see, you must have seen plainly enough long since, that I\u0027m not a man of business. In three words, I hate it. If I had been a rich man, I\u0027d have had a fellow to do all my business for me while I smoked my cigarette and looked on; and hitherto whenever it\u0027s been a question of business, money, and all those horrible details arising from the want of it, I\u0027ve shirked it as long as I could, and then stumbled through it in a devilish blind, stupid, haphazard kind of manner. That\u0027s been all very well so far; but now another question arises,--a very different question--one touching the heart and that kind of thing, and the welfare of a person who--however, I\u0027ll go into that by and by;--a question on which, I feel so deeply, that I\u0027ve determined to be guided by the advice of the clearest-headed man of my acquaintance--and so I\u0027ve sent for you.\" Robert Streightley bowed, and murmured a few words of incoherent thanks. Not money! Question on which he felt so deeply! What was Mr. Guyon driving at? \"I will be perfectly plain with you, my dear Robert,\" said Mr. Guyon, \"frank as the day, all open and aboveboard. I won\u0027t disguise from you, I don\u0027t attempt to disguise it from myself, that perhaps there never was a man less fitted than I am to have been blessed with what would be a crowning solace to many men--a daughter.\" Streightley involuntarily started as these words met his ear; and Mr. Guyon noticed the start, but he did not betray himself, and proceeded. \"I\u0027m not a domestic man, and not cut out for domestic happiness. I believe my enemies call me a loose fish, and \u0027pon my soul I think they\u0027re right. I like my rubber and my club, and--in fact, my freedom. I\u0027m a sort of claret-and-entrée butterfly, and was never intended for the roast-joint and bread-and-cheese menagé of respectability and home consumption. However, what was intended and what is are two very different things. I have a daughter, and--well, you\u0027re a man of the world, and I won\u0027t bore you with a father\u0027s maudlin praises of his child. She is--there, I was very near breaking into what I had just declared I would not do!--what I mean to say is, her future is my greatest care. I\u0027ve been a man of the world myself, and I know all she will be exposed to, and, my dear Robert, I tremble when I think of it. I\u0027ve only to refer to my own conscience to see what might be in store for her. Her poor mother--of whom she is the very image--was weak enough to marry me; and though--though I always treated her as a gentleman should treat his wife, by Jove! I know I--many shortcomings.\" Here Mr. Guyon buried his face in a large white pocket-handkerchief; and Streightley, not knowing what to say or do, drummed vacantly on the table. \"You follow me, my dear boy? Of course, I knew you would,\" resumed Mr. Guyon after a momentary pause. \"Now wait and hear the rest. A girl like Katharine, possessing--well, what I suppose even I may call many attractions--will necessarily receive a vast amount of admiration from all sorts of men; and it will be my duty--and a duty which I shall perform with the greatest strictness; she has no mother, you know, poor girl! and I must be doubly vigilant--to see that she does not get led away and tempted into any foolish alliance by any good-looking young fashionable fop with nothing but his good looks to recommend him. What my girl requires in a husband--for she is light and giddy, like the rest of her sex--is ballast, my dear Robert; a man of matured experience and not too young in years; one whom she could look up to, who could give her the position which her beauty, and--I may say her birth--entitle her to;--that\u0027s the sort of husband to whom alone I should be happy in giving my Katharine.\" Mr. Guyon paused once more, and Streightley bowed again in an absent manner, his right hand all the time plucking at his chin. \"The--the ideal, if I may so call it, that I have just drawn by no means resembles the writer of a letter which I received this morning honouring me by a proposal for Katharine\u0027s hand.\" Streightley\u0027s arm dropped upon the table, and he leant forward with an eager gaze. \"Yes, my dear Robert, the Goths are already in full march upon the--what d\u0027ye call \u0027em?--Capitol; and it is under these circumstances that I have sent for you to ask your advice.\" \"You--you\u0027re very good,\" murmured Streightley; \"and of course any thing that I can do--but I really scarcely see in such a matter as this--and without knowing--knowing any thing of the--the parties----\" \"My dear Robert, you don\u0027t think I would have sent for you with the notion of making any half-confidences. You shall know every detail. The writer of this letter,\" pursued Mr. Guyon, producing a packet from his desk,--\"of these two letters rather, for there is an enclosure for Katharine which I have not yet delivered--is a young man whom you may have seen with us--a Mr. Gordon Frere. A doosid good-looking, well-born, well-connected young fellow, who seems tremendously in earnest about it too,\" continued Mr. Guyon, balancing his trim gold eyeglasses on the bridge of his nose; \"for he writes to me to say--to say that--there, I need not read his letter--the gist of it is that he\u0027s been down to his father, at some place in the country where he writes from, and his father, who is a member of the House, has promised to use his influence with Government to get him a decent berth. Now that\u0027s plucky and honourable--I like that, eh, Robert?\" \"O yes, sir--very honourable indeed,\" said Streightley nervously. \"I think you mentioned that you had not forwarded the enclosure to Miss Guyon?\" \"Not yet,--no. I was desirous of having your opinion--as a man of business--on the proposal.\" It had come at last then, this long-expected blow to that dream of future happiness in which, spite of his own better reasoning, he had dared to indulge. She would be wrested from him--be taken to the heart of that smooth-spoken dandy whom he had loathed from the first instant of seeing him. All her loveliness--ah, how he remembered each brilliant charm!--would go to grace the life of that silly fop. The blood rushed back to Robert Streightley\u0027s heart as he thought of all this; his teeth were clenched, his pallid lips trembled and shook, and he thought that if he had had Gordon Frere before him at that instant he could have killed him without remorse. For an instant his better feeling struggled with his passion--the struggle was short and sharp, but the passion was victorious; and he said, in a strange dry voice, \"This gentleman scarcely fulfils the requirements you named just now, Mr. Guyon?\" \"Admirably put, my dear Robert--clearly and admirably put! I must allow it, he does not.\" \"If there were some one who, by his age and position at least, was calculated to--to be to this young lady--what you----\" \"Yes, my dear Robert, yes I--\" \"Who----\" Then with a great gulp----\"I\u0027m a bad hand at beating about the bush, sir. What I have seen of Miss Guyon has so enthralled me, that--that I would give my life to win her for my wife.\" He sought his handkerchief to wipe his fevered lips, but Mr. Guyon caught his hand and pressed it warmly. \"You, Robert, you? My dear boy, those are the happiest words that my ears have heard this many a day. You? Why, in a father\u0027s--what you may call fondest dreams, I could not have hoped for such good news as this! You? Why, of all people on earth, the very man!\" \"The very man\" looked any thing but happy as he sat there with pallid lips and puckered forehead and rapidly-beating heart--sat there silent and downcast, only occasionally raising his eyes to glance at the letter which Mr. Guyon had placed on the table before him. At that letter he stole long wistful glances; it seemed to possess for him a kind of baleful attraction; and after a short interval his regard fixed on it so directly that his companion could not fail to notice it. But though Mr. Guyon fully comprehended what was passing within Robert Streightley\u0027s breast, it by no means suited him to refer to it at once. \"My dear Robert,\" said he, after a few minutes\u0027 pause, \"the unexpected delight of your communication just made has really taken me--even old stager as I am--what I may call off my legs! I understand you to propose for my daughter\u0027s hand?\" \"The very man\" said never a word, but bowed his head abstractedly. \"Then I congratulate you and myself, my dear boy!\" said the elder man, again seizing his companion\u0027s passive hand--\"and I think we may regard it as a settled thing. My daughter has not seen much of you at present, but I am quite certain that when she once comes to know the qualities of your head and heart, she will----\" \"What about that letter, Mr. Guyon?\" said Robert Streightley in a cold, hard voice, pointing to the envelope still lying on the table. \"That letter!\" echoed Mr. Guyon, his face falling considerably. \"Well, my dear Robert, there\u0027s no denying that--eh? That letter--you see that young man Frere, Gordon Frere, gentlemanly fellow, good address, and all that kind of thing, has had opportunities of--in fact making his way, which--wilful woman and so on. Gad, if that letter were delivered, there\u0027s no knowing how things might turn out!\" Streightley\u0027s heart sunk within him, and he turned faint and sick; but he controlled himself sufficiently to say: \"Then you were a little rash in your congratulations, Mr. Guyon?\" \"Not at all, my dear boy, not at all. Recollect--I spoke of a contingency. I said--if that letter were delivered.\" \"If that letter were delivered to Miss Guyon? Do you mean to say that you would dare to Withhold it from her?\" \"\u0027Dare\u0027 is a very awkward word, my dear Robert. It appears to me that if one could select two men as judges of what should or should not be addressed to a young lady, they would be her father--and her intended husband.\" \"But that letter!\" \"Well, my dear fellow--that letter? Shall I give it to Katharine? Shall we instal Mr. Gordon Frere into what should and what will be your position?--shall I subject myself to a fortnight\u0027s confounded rows, and finally saddle myself for life with a \u0027detrimental\u0027 son-in-law? or shall I quietly put it by, and acquaint my daughter with your very delightful proposal? My dear Robert, you look aside and shake your head; but I am an older man than you, and know that I am--that we are--acting for the best. Recollect what the fellow--Kean, I think--says in the play: \u0027He that is robbed not wanting what is stolen, let him not know it and he\u0027s not robbed at all.\u0027 Doosid good that, and doosid appropriate. So we\u0027ll settle upon that course, eh? and you\u0027ll leave all to me?--What! you\u0027re not going, my dear boy--you\u0027ll stay to luncheon?\" \"Not this morning, thank you; not now, Mr. Guyon--I--I must go now!\" and Robert Streightley passed into the street, and for the first time in his life felt a sense of shame at his heart, and a desire to shun the glances of those whom he encountered. Mr. Guyon, so soon as the door had closed behind his friend, drew his chair to his desk, carefully read through Gordon Frere\u0027s letter to Katharine, hitherto unopened, replaced it and the letter to himself in their envelope, which he carefully endorsed with the words \"Shown to R.S.\" and the date, and locked them away in a private drawer. Then he wrote a rather long and elaborate letter to Mr. Frere, addressed it with great care, was very natty in his arrangement of its postage-stamp, sealed it with a large splodge of red wax bearing his coat-of-arms, and went upstairs. On the third night after the events just recorded Charles Yeldham and Gordon Frere were walking up and down the departure platform at London Bridge, by the side of the mail-train just about to start. Frere was dressed in travelling costume, and looked, as most young fellows do in such garb, sufficiently picturesque. But his face was deadly pale, save where there were blotches of bright red under his eyes. \"Now listen, Charley,\" said he, \"and hear my last words. I go away, cursing that woman. You know I\u0027m not romantic, or melodramatic, or any thing of that kind; but she\u0027s spoilt my life for me, and I curse her for it. It\u0027s too bad,--by the Lord, it\u0027s too bad! You know how I--yes, damme, how I loved her. Followed her about like a spaniel, and she could have done any thing with me. And then never to keep her appointment, never to send me a line; and then when I write and make her a regular offer, never to take the least notice--not a line, by Jove!--and to leave her infernal old father to write to me that she\u0027s engaged to that cold-blooded, mannerless beast, Streightley! O, I know he\u0027s a friend of yours; but, damme it\u0027s too bad! And when the governor, dear old boy, had actually got me a nomination to the Treasury, and--however, that\u0027s thrown up, and I\u0027m going out to an infernal German principality to be secretary to that bewigged old fool in that carriage, and leaving you, and all through the tricks of that heartless coquette! O yes, all right! I hear the bell, and I\u0027m going to get in. Now, God bless you, old boy; but recollect my last words. I leave this place cursing that girl, and I\u0027ll be even with her yet!\" Mr. Frere wrung his friend\u0027s hand and sprang into the carriage as the train began to move. Charles Yeldham waited until the last glimmer of its red lamps had died away, then turned slowly round, and walked towards his dreary chambers. \"It\u0027s very bad for you, Gordon, my poor boy!\" said he to himself as he strolled along; \"very bad indeed, just now! but I sadly fear it will be worse for others in the long-run--and for poor Bob Streightley worst of all!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2762/76213.html","bookId":1340,"book":{"id":1340,"title":"Kissing the Rod.","description":"简介： There was no name on the doorposts, nothing beyond the number--48--to serve as a guide; and yet it may be doubted whether any firm in the City was better known to the postman, the bankers\u0027-clerks, and all who had regular business to transact with the...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2762","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:53 AM"}}
