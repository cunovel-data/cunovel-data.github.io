Some sat on chairs and benches whilst others were crouched down on the hard linoleum floor. The group was gathered around a single dull gas lamp and a quick count of the heads he could see revealed that he seemed to be the only absentee. A few of the poor bewildered souls glanced up at him as he approached.\n Feeling suddenly self-conscious (but knowing that he had no reason to care) he sat down at the nearest edge of the group. He sat down between two women. He\u0027d been trapped in the same building as them for the best part of a day and yet he didn\u0027t even know their names. He knew very little about anyone and they knew very little about him. As much as he needed their closeness and contact, he found the distance between the individual survivors still strangely welcome.\n A man called Ralph was trying to address the group. From his manner and the precise, thoughtful way that he spoke Carl assumed he\u0027d been a barrister or, at the very least, a solicitor until the world had been turned upside down yesterday morning.\n \u0027What we must do,\u0027 Ralph said, clearly, carefully and slowly and with almost ponderous consideration, \u0027is get ourselves into some sort of order here before we even think about exploring outside.\u0027\n \u0027Why?\u0027 someone asked from the other side of the group. \u0027What do we need to get in order?\u0027\n \u0027We need to know who and what we\u0027ve got here. We need food and water, we need bedding and clothes and we should be able to find most of that in here. We also need to know what we haven\u0027t got and we should start thinking about where to get it.\u0027\n \u0027Why?\u0027 the voice interrupted again. \u0027We know we\u0027ll find everything we need outside. We shouldn\u0027t waste our time in here, we should just get out and get on with it.\u0027\n Ralph\u0027s confidence was clearly a professional facade and, at the first sign of any resistance, he squirmed. He pushed his heavy-rimmed glasses back up the bridge of his nose with the tip of his finger and took a deep breath.\n \u0027That\u0027s not a good idea. Look, I think we\u0027ve got to make our personal safety and security our prime concern and then...\u0027\n \u0027I agree,\u0027 the voice interrupted again. \u0027But why stop here? There are a thousand and one better places to go, why stay here? What makes you any safer here than if you were lying on the dotted white line in the middle of the Stanhope Road?\u0027\n Carl shuffled around so that he could see through the mass of heads and bodies and identify the speaker. It was Michael, the bloke who had cooked the soup earlier.\n \u0027We don\u0027t know what\u0027s outside...\u0027 Ralph began.\n \u0027But we\u0027ve got to go out there eventually, you accept that?\u0027\n He stammered and fiddled with his glasses again.\n \u0027Yes, but...\u0027\n \u0027Look, Ralph, I\u0027m not trying to make this any more difficult than it already is. We\u0027ve got to leave here to get the supplies we need. All I\u0027m saying is why bother delaying it and why bother coming back? Why not go somewhere else?\u0027\n Ralph couldn\u0027t answer. It was obvious to Carl and, probably, to pretty much everyone else, that the reason Ralph didn\u0027t want to go outside was the same reason Stuart Jeffries had admitted to wanting to stay trapped in the hall earlier. They were both scared.\n \u0027We could try and find somewhere else,\u0027 he began, hesitantly, \u0027but we\u0027ve got a shelter here which is secure and...\u0027\n \u0027And cold and dirty and uncomfortable,\u0027 Carl said quickly.\n \u0027Okay, it\u0027s not ideal but...\u0027\n \u0027But what?\u0027 pressed Michael. \u0027It seems to me that we can pretty much have our pick of everywhere and everything at the moment.\u0027\n The room fell silent for a few seconds. Ralph suddenly sat up straight and pushed his glasses back up his nose again. He seemed to have found a reason to justify staying put.\n \u0027But what about the music and the fire?\u0027 he said, much more animated. \u0027Stuart and Jack managed to bring us all here by lighting the fire and playing music. If we did it again we might find more survivors. There might already be people on their way to us.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t think so,\u0027 said Michael. \u0027No-one\u0027s arrived here since me. If anyone else had heard the music they\u0027d have been here by now. I agree with what you\u0027re saying, but again, why here? Why not find somewhere better to stop, get ourselves organised there and light a bloody big bonfire right in the middle of the road outside?\u0027\n Carl agreed.\n \u0027He\u0027s right. We should get a beacon or something sorted, but let\u0027s get ourselves safe and secure first.\u0027\n \u0027A new beacon somewhere else is going to be seen by more people, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 asked Sandra Goodwin, a fifty year-old housewife. \u0027And isn\u0027t that what we want?\u0027\n \u0027Bottom line here,\u0027 Michael said, changing his tone and raising his voice slightly so that everyone suddenly turned and gave him their full attention, \u0027is that we\u0027ve got to look after ourselves first of all and then start to think about anyone else who might possibly still be alive.\u0027\n \u0027But shouldn\u0027t we start looking for other survivors now?\u0027 someone else asked.\n \u0027I don\u0027t think we should,\u0027 he replied, \u0027I agree that we should get a beacon or something going, but there\u0027s no point in wasting time actively looking for other people yet. If there are others then they\u0027ll have more chance of finding us than we\u0027ll have finding them.\u0027\n \u0027Why do you say that?\u0027 Sandra asked.\n \u0027Stands to reason,\u0027 he grunted. \u0027Does anyone know how many people used to live in this city?\u0027\n A couple of seconds silence followed before someone answered.\n \u0027About a quarter of a million people. Two hundred thousand or something like that.\u0027\n \u0027And there are twenty-six of us in here.\u0027\n \u0027So?\u0027 pressed an uncomfortable looking Ralph, trying desperately to find a way back into the conversation.\n \u0027So what does that say to you?\u0027\n Ralph shrugged his shoulders.\n \u0027It says to me,\u0027 Michael continued, \u0027that looking for anyone else would be like looking for a needle in a haystack.\u0027\n Carl nodded in agreement and picked up where Michael had left off.\n \u0027What\u0027s outside?\u0027 he asked quietly.\n No response.\n He looked from left to right at the faces gathered around him. He glanced across the room and made eye contact with Michael.\n \u0027I\u0027ll tell you,\u0027 he said quietly, \u0027there\u0027s nothing. The only people I\u0027ve seen moving since all of this began are sitting in this hall. But we don\u0027t know if it\u0027s over. We don\u0027t know if we\u0027re going to wake up tomorrow. We don\u0027t know if what happened to the rest of them will happen to us.\u0027\n Ralph interrupted.\n \u0027Come on,\u0027 he protested, \u0027stop talking like that. You\u0027re not doing anyone any good talking like that...\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m trying to make a point...\u0027\n Michael spoke again.\n \u0027Since this all started have any of you heard a plane or helicopter pass overhead?\u0027\n Again, no response.\n \u0027The airport\u0027s five miles south of here, if there were any planes flying we\u0027d have heard them. There\u0027s a train station that links the city to the airport and the track runs along the other side of the Stanhope Road. Anyone heard a train?\u0027\n Silence.\n \u0027So how many people do you think this has affected?\u0027 Carl asked cautiously.\n \u0027If this was the only region affected,\u0027 Michael answered, \u0027logic says that help would have arrived by now.\u0027\n \u0027What are you saying?\u0027 a man called Tim asked quietly.\n Michael shrugged his shoulders.\n \u0027I guess I\u0027m saying that this is a national disaster at the very least. The lack of air traffic makes me think that it could be worse than that.\u0027\n An awkward murmur of stark realisation rippled across the group.\n \u0027Michael\u0027s right,\u0027 Emma said. \u0027This thing spread so quickly that there\u0027s no way of knowing what kind of area\u0027s been affected. It was so fast that I doubt whether anything could have been done to prevent it spreading before it was too late.\u0027\n \u0027But this area might be too infected to travel to,\u0027 Tim said, his voice strained and frightened. \u0027They might have sealed Northwich off.\u0027\n \u0027They might have,\u0027 Michael agreed. \u0027But I don\u0027t think that\u0027s very likely, do you?\u0027\n Tim said nothing.\n \u0027So what do we do?\u0027 an unsure female voice asked from the middle of the group.\n \u0027I think we should get away from here,\u0027 Michael said. \u0027Look, if I\u0027m completely honest I\u0027m just thinking about myself here and the rest of you should make your own minds up. It\u0027s just that I\u0027m not prepared to sit here and wait for help when I\u0027m pretty sure that it\u0027s never going to arrive. I don\u0027t want to sit trapped in here surrounded by thousands of bloody bodies. I want out of the city. I want to get away from here, find somewhere safe, make myself comfortable and then just sit and wait and see what happens next.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1/page-8.html","bookId":2557,"book":{"id":2557,"title":"Autumn (Autumn #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Autumn (Autumn #1) \n A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, Autumn chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... \n Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, Autumn offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-autumn-1.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:48:44 AM"}}
