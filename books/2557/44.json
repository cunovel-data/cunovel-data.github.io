There are bloody thousands of them down there.\u0027 Emma had been sitting with Carl who lay motionless on the bed. She got up and walked over to where Michael stood and glanced down over his shoulder into the farmyard below. He was right - there was already a dense crowd of hundreds of detestable figures surrounding the house and their numbers were increasing constantly. They continually poured in through the gap where the gate on the bridge had been. \u0027Why do they keep coming?\u0027 she asked under her breath. \u0027We came here because we thought there would be fewer of them, so why do they keep coming here?\u0027 She knew that Michael couldn\u0027t give her any definite answers to her questions, but she felt a need to ask anyway. \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 he replied. \u0027I still think it\u0027s got to be the noise.\u0027 \u0027But we\u0027ve not been making any noise.\u0027 \u0027We have compared to the rest of the world. Christ, how many times have we been through this? The whole planet is bloody silent. Every time one of us moves you must be able to hear it for miles around.\u0027 \u0027So the sound of the car engines...\u0027 \u0027Keeps attracting them. And even when the sound dies down, I think they\u0027re staying close because they know we\u0027re nearby.\u0027 \u0027Do you really think so?\u0027 He nodded sadly. \u0027It would explain why there are so many of them around here now, wouldn\u0027t it?\u0027 \u0027So if we stay indoors and keep quiet and out of sight for a while then they should...\u0027 He shook his head with a resigned sadness. \u0027I don\u0027t think that\u0027s going to work anymore,\u0027 he sighed. \u0027Why not?\u0027 Rather than answer her, Michael instead just opened the bedroom window slightly. The sudden forcing noise as he pushed the sticking window open caused a ripple of excitement to quickly spread through the rotting crowd below. \u0027Just listen to that,\u0027 he whispered. Emma did as she was told, and was soon aware of a cold, alien sound coming from the diseased hordes below. The shuffling of weary, leaden feet, the occasional guttural groan, the sound of clumsy bodies tripping and falling - each individually insignificant noise combined to create a constant, chilling soundtrack. \u0027It\u0027s too late for us to just sit still and play dead now,\u0027 Michael explained. \u0027It\u0027s got to the stage where they\u0027re making enough noise by themselves to keep attracting more and more of them here. And with a crowd of this size, it doesn\u0027t matter how quiet we are, the bastard things are going to keep coming regardless.\u0027 As realisation dawned, Emma stepped back from the window, sat down on a chair and rested her head in her hands. \u0027So what do we do now?\u0027 she asked anxiously. Michael didn\u0027t answer. A heavy and ominous quiet descended on the room, disturbed only by the noise from outside and by Carl who groaned in pain. \u0027How you doing?\u0027 Michael asked, his voice still a hushed whisper. Carl didn\u0027t respond. Emma stood up and leant over the injured man. She looked him up and down, thought for a second or two and then walked back over to Michael. \u0027It\u0027s difficult to say how he is,\u0027 she sighed, whispering so that Carl couldn\u0027t hear her. \u0027He\u0027s exhausted and he\u0027s still in shock. He doesn\u0027t look too badly injured physically, but he\u0027s really suffering.\u0027 \u0027Has he said anything to you?\u0027 \u0027What about?\u0027 Michael closed the window and moved away from the glass. \u0027About what he found in the city if he ever got there? And why he came back if he did?\u0027 She shook her head. \u0027He hasn\u0027t said anything. I think we should...\u0027 Michael wasn\u0027t listening. He walked over to the side of the bed and knelt down next to Carl. Carl didn\u0027t respond. He lay there motionless, staring up at the ceiling. \u0027Mate,\u0027 Michael began cautiously. \u0027Carl, can you hear me?\u0027 He swallowed painfully and nodded. \u0027You okay?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 he answered, his voice tired and little more than a whisper. Carl\u0027s eyes flickered shut and then opened again. Without moving his head he looked over towards Michael, then back to Emma, and then back to Michael again. \u0027Did you get to Northwich?\u0027 Michael asked. \u0027Did you get...\u0027 \u0027I got there.\u0027 Michael glanced over at Emma. \u0027So what happened? Why did you come back?\u0027 He looked up at the ceiling again, licked his dry lips and swallowed hard. \u0027There was no-one there,\u0027 he mumbled. \u0027Where, at the community centre? Did you manage to get back to the community centre...\u0027 \u0027They\u0027ve gone. There was no-one there.\u0027 \u0027So where did they go?\u0027 Carl slowly lifted himself up onto his elbows, paused for a second, took a deep breath and then swallowed again. \u0027I don\u0027t think they went anywhere. When I got there the door was open. Inside the place was full of bodies.\u0027 \u0027What bodies? The ones from outside or...?\u0027 He shook his head. \u0027Survivors. I don\u0027t think they\u0027d been dead that long.\u0027 \u0027What happened?\u0027 asked Emma. \u0027The bodies must have got inside. There\u0027s so many of them that the survivors didn\u0027t have a chance. There\u0027s only one way into that building so there was no way out...\u0027 He slumped back onto the bed, tired by the effort of talking. \u0027Fucking hell,\u0027 Michael spat, standing up quickly and walking across the room. He kicked the bedroom door and it slammed shut, sending a sudden noise like a gunshot echoing through the house and causing the creatures outside to stir again. For the first time since he\u0027d watched the world die around him weeks ago he couldn\u0027t think straight. He didn\u0027t know what to do. They had reached a dead end and there didn\u0027t seem to be any options. The farmhouse was under siege, and the only other place of refuge that they knew of was gone. Emma sensed his fear and walked over to stand close to him. \u0027What are you thinking?\u0027 she asked cautiously, although she didn\u0027t really want to know. Her mind was also filled with hopeless thoughts. Michael didn\u0027t answer. He turned to face the wall, not wanting her to see the frightened tears welling up in his eyes. \u0027We\u0027ve got to do something,\u0027 she insisted. \u0027Do we just sit here and wait or do we...?\u0027 \u0027We don\u0027t have much of a fucking choice, do we?\u0027 he snapped. \u0027We can take our chances outside or we can sit in this room and wait until it\u0027s safe again. And that\u0027s going to take bloody ages...\u0027 \u0027The house is still secure...\u0027 \u0027I know it is, but what use is that to us anymore? Go into any room downstairs and there will be a hundred of those fucking things staring in at you through the window. Once they see you they\u0027ll go fucking wild and before you know it we\u0027re back to square one...\u0027 \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 \u0027I mean that it\u0027s only going to take a little bit of careless noise or for a few of those things to catch sight of one of us and we\u0027ll be right back to where we started. We could sit in this fucking house in silence for six months until all but a handful of them have disappeared and we\u0027d still have a problem. All it needs is for one of them to see us and start hammering on the door and then more would hear that, then more, then more...\u0027 \u0027So what are you saying?\u0027 He shrugged his shoulders and wiped his eyes. \u0027I don\u0027t know...\u0027 he muttered, taking care to avoid letting Emma know what he was really thinking. But she was intelligent and persistent and she\u0027d already worked it out for herself. \u0027I think you\u0027re saying that we have to leave. I don\u0027t think we can stay here any longer.\u0027 He nodded. \u0027Don\u0027t know where we\u0027re going to go or how we\u0027re going to get out of here...\u0027 \u0027But we don\u0027t have any option, do we?\u0027 Michael didn\u0027t respond. He wiped his eyes again and looked around the room. For almost a minute he said nothing. \u0027We\u0027ve got to keep out of sight and out of earshot of those bloody things,\u0027 he eventually announced, \u0027and we\u0027ve got to get as much stuff together as we can. We\u0027ll just have to fight our way through.\u0027 \u0027But how? How are we going to get to the cars...?\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ll wait for a couple of hours until it\u0027s dark,\u0027 he interrupted, \u0027and we\u0027ll see if a few of them disappear. I\u0027ll try and get the generator started and...\u0027 \u0027Why?\u0027 \u0027Because it will distract them, won\u0027t it? If there\u0027s a louder sound round the back of the house they\u0027re more likely to go looking for us there, aren\u0027t they? Anyway, we\u0027ll wait and give Carl a chance to come round and pull himself together, then we\u0027ll just have to go for it.\u0027 With that he walked out of the bedroom to start collecting their things from the upstairs rooms of the house. Emma stayed where she was, leaning against the bedroom wall. Now that the conversation had ended an uneasy silence had descended upon the building. The deceptive peace, however, was short-lived. She quickly became aware of the bodies outside again. She stood there in absolute hopeless terror and listened as the dragging footsteps of hundreds upon hundreds of rotting corpses advanced closer and closer towards them.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1/page-44.html","bookId":2557,"book":{"id":2557,"title":"Autumn (Autumn #1)","description":"Storyline: Autumn (Autumn #1) A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, Autumn chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, Autumn offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-autumn-1.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:48:44 AM"}}
