{"id":112054,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"Wednesday night. Nine o\u0027clock.\n Michael cooked a meal for himself, Carl and Emma. He seemed to have allowed himself to relax slightly now that there was a decent physical barrier between them and the rest of the world. Emma noticed that he had now started to occupy his time by doing odd jobs around the house. She had casually mentioned that a shelf in an upstairs room was coming loose from the wall. By the time she\u0027d next walked past the room Michael had completed the repair. Each one of the survivors had an increasing, burning desire - almost a guttural, basic need in fact - to keep themselves occupied. Keeping busy helped them to forget (almost to the point of denial) that the world outside their door had crumbled and died.\n The three of them had been sitting in the kitchen for the best part of two hours before the meal was ready and Michael was finally in a position to serve dinner. It was the longest length of time that they\u0027d willingly spent in each other\u0027s company since the trip to Byster a few days earlier. The atmosphere was subdued and low as was to be expected. Conversation was sparse. Michael busied himself cooking (as usual), Emma read a book and for the most part, Carl did very little.\n Emma found some wine. She had discovered a few bottles hidden in a dusty rack wedged between two kitchen units and she\u0027d wasted no time in uncorking a bottle of white and pouring out three large glasses, passing one each to Carl and Michael. Carl normally didn\u0027t drink wine but tonight he was ready to make an exception. He wanted to get drunk. He wanted to be so fucking drunk that he couldn\u0027t remember his own name. He wanted to pass out on the kitchen floor and forget about everything for as long as was possible. He wasn\u0027t even that bothered about waking up the next morning.\n The food was good - probably the best meal they\u0027d eaten together - and that, combined with the wine, helped perpetuate an uneasy sense of normality. That sense of normality, however, had the unwanted side effect of helping them to remember everything about the past that they had been trying to forget. Michael decided that the best way of dealing with what they\u0027d lost was to try and talk about it.\n \u0027So,\u0027 he began, chewing thoughtfully on a mouthful of food as he spoke, \u0027Wednesday night. What would you two usually have been doing on a Wednesday night?\u0027\n There was an awkward silence. The same awkward silence which always seemed to descend on any conversation that dared to broach the subject of the way the world had been before last Tuesday.\n \u0027I\u0027d either have been studying or drinking,\u0027 Emma eventually replied, also sensing that it made sense to talk. \u0027Or probably both.\u0027\n \u0027Drinking midweek?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027d drink any night.\u0027\n \u0027What about you, Carl?\u0027\n Carl toyed with his food and knocked back a large mouthful of wine.\n \u0027I was on call,\u0027 he said slowly. He was obviously unsure about talking about the past. He had only just begun to speak and it was already hurting him. \u0027I couldn\u0027t drink in the week but I\u0027d make up for it at the weekend.\u0027\n \u0027Were you a pub or a club man?\u0027 Emma asked.\n \u0027Pub,\u0027 he replied, very definitely.\n \u0027So what about your little girl?\u0027\n There was an awkward pause and Emma wondered whether she\u0027d gone too far and said the wrong thing. Carl looked down at his food again and swallowed a second mouthful of wine, this one emptying the glass. He grabbed hold of the bottle and helped himself to a refill before continuing.\n \u0027Sarah and me used to walk down to the local in the afternoon,\u0027 he began, his eyes moistening with tears. \u0027We were part of a crowd. There was always someone in there we knew. We\u0027d start drinking around three or four o\u0027clock and then leave just before closing. There were always kids Gemma\u0027s age there. They had a play area and she had her friends and they used to...\u0027\n When the pain became too much to bear he stopped and drank more wine.\n \u0027Sorry,\u0027 Emma mumbled instinctively. \u0027I shouldn\u0027t have said anything. I wasn\u0027t thinking.\u0027\n Carl didn\u0027t respond.\n \u0027Why shouldn\u0027t you have said anything?\u0027 Michael asked.\n \u0027What?\u0027\n \u0027Why are you apologising? And why don\u0027t you want to talk about it, Carl?\u0027\n Carl looked up and glared at the other man with tears of pain streaked down his face.\n \u0027I don\u0027t want to talk because it fucking well hurts too much,\u0027 he spat, almost having to force the words out. \u0027You don\u0027t know how it feels.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve lost people too...\u0027\n \u0027You didn\u0027t lose a child. You don\u0027t know how that feels. You couldn\u0027t.\u0027\n Michael knew he was right. He wasn\u0027t sure whether it was sensible or stupid, but he desperately felt that he should force this conversation to continue. He had decided that they wouldn\u0027t be able to move on and make something of the rest of their lives until they\u0027d managed to sweep away the remains of the past.\n Carl was staring into space again.\n \u0027I\u0027d give anything to be back in lectures again,\u0027 Emma sighed. \u0027Stupid isn\u0027t it? Before I used to do anything I could to avoid them, now I just want to...\u0027\n \u0027You just can\u0027t imagine what this feels like,\u0027 Carl said under his breath, interrupting her. \u0027This is killing me.\u0027\n \u0027What is?\u0027 Michael pressed gently.\n \u0027Every morning I wake up and I wish that it was over and I was dead,\u0027 he explained. \u0027Every single day the pain is worse than the last. I still can\u0027t accept that they\u0027ve gone and I just...\u0027\n \u0027It hurts now but it will get easier,\u0027 the other man said, beginning to regret his earlier words. \u0027It must get easier over time, it must...\u0027\n \u0027Will it? Know that for a fact do you?\u0027\n \u0027No, but I...\u0027\n \u0027Just shut your mouth then,\u0027 Carl said, his voice suddenly surprisingly calm and level. \u0027If you don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about, don\u0027t say anything. Don\u0027t waste your fucking time trying to make me feel better because you can\u0027t. There\u0027s nothing you can say or do that will make any of this any easier.\u0027\n With that he got up and walked away from the table without saying another word. For a few long seconds the only sounds to be heard in the house were heavy, lethargic footsteps as Carl dragged himself upstairs and shut himself away in isolation in his room.\n A short while later Michael opened another bottle of wine. He didn\u0027t ask, he just poured Emma another glass. She didn\u0027t resist.\n \u0027Really fucked up there, didn\u0027t I?\u0027 he said quietly.\n She nodded.\n \u0027We both did. It\u0027s obvious he\u0027s struggling. I should never have asked him about his little girl.\u0027\n Michael immediately became defensive again.\n \u0027Maybe not, but I still think he\u0027s got to talk,\u0027 he explained. \u0027Jesus, we can\u0027t move on until we\u0027ve dealt with everything that\u0027s happened. We can\u0027t start to build anything up until we\u0027ve sorted out everything that...\u0027\n \u0027Have you dealt with everything then?\u0027 she asked, cutting across him.\n He paused for a moment and then shook his head.\n \u0027No,\u0027 he admitted. \u0027Have you?\u0027\n \u0027I haven\u0027t even started. To be honest I don\u0027t even know where to start.\u0027\n \u0027I think we should all start with what hurts the most. With Carl it\u0027s his daughter. What about you?\u0027\n She drank more wine and considered his question.\n \u0027Don\u0027t know really. Everything hurts.\u0027\n \u0027Okay, so when does it get to you the most?\u0027\n Again she couldn\u0027t answer.\n \u0027Don\u0027t know. I was thinking about my sister\u0027s kids yesterday and that really bothered me. I didn\u0027t see them that often, but the thought that I might not see them again...\u0027\n \u0027Where did they live?\u0027\n \u0027Overseas. Jackie\u0027s husband got moved to Kuwait with his job for a couple of years. They were due to come back next summer.\u0027\n \u0027They still might.\u0027\n \u0027How do you reckon that then?\u0027\n He shrugged his shoulders.\n \u0027We still don\u0027t know for certain that any other countries have been affected by this, do we?\u0027\n \u0027Not for sure, but...\u0027\n \u0027But what?\u0027\n \u0027But I think we would have heard something by now, don\u0027t you?\u0027\n \u0027Not necessarily.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, come on, Michael. If there was anyone left we would have heard something. You said as much back in Northwich last week.\u0027\n At the mention of the name of the town they\u0027d fled from Michael immediately began to think about the crowd of survivors left behind in the shabby surroundings of the Whitchurch Community Centre. He pictured the faces of Stuart, Ralph, Kate and the others and wondered what had become of them. Fortunately, before he had time to think too much, Emma asked another question.\n \u0027So what about your family then?\u0027\n \u0027What about them?\u0027\n \u0027Who do you miss the most? Did you have a partner.\u0027\n Michael took a deep breath, stretched and yawned and then ran his fingers through his hair.\n \u0027I had been seeing a girl called Marie for about six months,\u0027 he began, \u0027but I haven\u0027t thought about her at all.\u0027\n \u0027Why not?\u0027\n \u0027We split up three weeks ago.\u0027\n \u0027Do you miss her?\u0027\n \u0027Not any more. I don\u0027t miss my best friend who she was screwing either. There are plenty of other people I miss more.\u0027\n \u0027Such as?\u0027\n \u0027Such as my mum. Last night when I was trying to get to sleep I was thinking about her. You know that feeling you get when you\u0027re just about to go to sleep and you think you can hear a voice or see a face or something?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027Well I thought I heard my mum last night. I can\u0027t even tell you what it was I thought she\u0027d said. I just heard her for a split second. It was like she was lying next to me.\u0027\n \u0027That was me,\u0027 Emma smiled, trying desperately to make light of a conversation that was becoming increasingly morose.\n Michael managed half a smile before returning his attention to his drink. Emma studied him intently. A very private and independent man from day one, she was beginning to see signs that there might be more to him than she first thought. He was blunt, opinionated and occasionally aggressive, but she was beginning to see that despite his seemingly self-centred emotions he was genuinely concerned about Carl\u0027s and her own welfare.\n The conversation in the kitchen continued as long as the wine lasted. As time passed by their discussions became less in-depth and focussed and more trivial and trite to the point where, by the early hours of Thursday morning, almost everything they talked about was insignificant and inane.\n During the hours they spent together, Emma and Michael learnt about each other\u0027s strengths, weaknesses, hobbies, interests, phobias and (now pointless) aspirations and ambitions. They talked about their favourite books, films, records, televisions programmes, concerts, musicians, actors, foods, politicians, authors and comedians. They learnt about other redundant aspects of each other\u0027s lives - their religious beliefs, their political views and their moral standings.\n They finally made their way up to the bedroom they innocently shared just before two in the morning. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1/page-29.html","bookId":2557,"book":{"id":2557,"title":"Autumn (Autumn #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Autumn (Autumn #1) \n A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, Autumn chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... \n Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, Autumn offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-autumn-1.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:48:44 AM"}}
