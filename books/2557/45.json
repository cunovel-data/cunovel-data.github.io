Each nervous, painful minute dragged unbearably, almost to the point that every last second seemed to take a protracted eternity to pass. In the time that it took the low grey light to fade completely to black, Carl did not move. He lay motionless on the bed, still staring up at the ceiling. Emma wondered if he was even aware of what was happening around him, or whether he had become completely withdrawn and catatonic. Whatever, she decided that she didn\u0027t want to disturb him. She didn\u0027t dare take the risk, at least like this he was quiet. She was frightened that if she tried to help him or even get him to try and move he might suddenly turn and crack, and that any reaction from him might provoke another unwanted and terrifying response from the vast crowds outside the house. Both Emma and Michael had managed to pack their few belongings. Between them they had done the same with Carl\u0027s gear which had been bagged up in black plastic refuse sacks. They stockpiled their luggage in the shadows at the top of the staircase, not daring to get any closer to the front of the house for fear of being seen. They had no way of easily reaching the more important supplies downstairs. As much as they needed their clothes, they both knew that taking the food and other items left in the kitchen could well be crucial to their continued survival. Michael and Emma passed each other on the landing close to the bedroom door. They stopped there for a few seconds and spoke to each other in hushed, anxious whispers. \u0027You okay?\u0027 he asked. Emma\u0027s eyes looked tired and frightened in the half-light. \u0027I\u0027m all right.\u0027 \u0027Carl okay?\u0027 \u0027No change.\u0027 \u0027Is he going to be all right?\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t know.\u0027 \u0027Christ, you were the one studying to be a doctor.\u0027 \u0027Fuck off, this is way beyond anything I studied. I don\u0027t even know if I\u0027m going to be all right anymore, never mind anyone else.\u0027 \u0027Sorry.\u0027 \u0027Forget it.\u0027 \u0027Got much stuff together?\u0027 \u0027Got my clothes and a few odds and ends. What about you?\u0027 \u0027The same. We\u0027re going to have to get downstairs though and try and get some of the stuff in the kitchen packed.\u0027 \u0027So how are we going to do that? There are bloody huge windows in every room. We can\u0027t go anywhere without being seen from outside.\u0027 \u0027I know.\u0027 \u0027We\u0027re going to have to leave with what we\u0027ve got, aren\u0027t we?\u0027 \u0027I think we\u0027ll be lucky to get that much out.\u0027 \u0027So what are we going to do?\u0027 Michael shrugged his shoulders. \u0027Get out with nothing and start again somewhere else, I suppose,\u0027 he sighed. \u0027Do what we did when we arrived here. Find somewhere that looks half-decent, get ourselves settled and then get out and get supplies.\u0027 \u0027But won\u0027t the same thing happen again?\u0027 \u0027Probably.\u0027 That wasn\u0027t the answer Emma had wanted to hear. It was what she\u0027d expected him to say, but she had still been hoping for a little more encouragement. \u0027So how do we get out? Have you thought about that?\u0027 Michael shrugged his shoulders again. \u0027We\u0027ll just have to make a run for it. Get Carl up and about, get loaded up with stuff and then go for it. We\u0027ll have to fight our way through.\u0027 \u0027Think we can do it?\u0027 A third nonchalant shrug. A few moments of awkward silence followed. \u0027Are there still as many outside?\u0027 Emma wondered. \u0027Can\u0027t tell,\u0027 he replied. \u0027Probably. I\u0027ve seen a few of them walking away, but there are just as many still coming in over the bridge.\u0027 \u0027They can\u0027t get inside, can they?\u0027 \u0027We\u0027d have to be unlucky. It\u0027s locked tight down there but...\u0027 \u0027But what? They can\u0027t get in, can they?\u0027 she interrupted, again looking for reassurance from Michael... \u0027But there are thousands of them,\u0027 he continued. \u0027Their sheer mass could do some damage.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t think they\u0027ll be able to force their way in.\u0027 \u0027Neither do I. But then again this time yesterday I never thought they\u0027d get through the barrier...\u0027 \u0027But they didn\u0027t get through, we let them in.\u0027 \u0027Doesn\u0027t matter, does it? Fact is they\u0027re through. And it wouldn\u0027t matter how they got inside if they managed to get in here. Wouldn\u0027t matter if they put a window through or if we let them in through the front door. Fact is we\u0027d be completely fucked whatever.\u0027 \u0027When are we going to do this, Mike?\u0027 \u0027As soon as we can. We\u0027re kidding ourselves if we think it\u0027s going to get any better for us tonight. We\u0027re not going to gain anything by waiting.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1/page-45.html","bookId":2557,"book":{"id":2557,"title":"Autumn (Autumn #1)","description":"Storyline: Autumn (Autumn #1) A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, Autumn chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, Autumn offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-autumn-1.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:48:44 AM"}}
