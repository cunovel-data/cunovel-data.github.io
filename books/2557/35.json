{"id":112060,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"\u0027Planning on leaving tonight then?\u0027 Michael asked.\\n\\n An hour after returning from Pennmyre and Carl was still outside, getting ready to go and refuelling the bike and loading his few belongings. He looked up and nodded at Michael.\\n\\n \u0027Might as well,\u0027 he quietly replied.\\n\\n \u0027Sure you want to take the risk?\u0027\\n\\n He shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re all taking risks whatever we do,\u0027 he answered. \u0027I don\u0027t think it matters anymore.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well I think you\u0027re asking for trouble. You should at least wait until the morning when it\u0027s...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll be all right,\u0027 he insisted.\\n\\n \u0027Fine.\u0027\\n\\n Michael sat down on the damp ground near to the bike. He looked around the yard, first quickly checking that the barrier round the house seemed secure and then looking up high, staring into the trees surrounding, listening to drops of water from the earlier heavy rainfall dripping down from leaf to leaf to leaf before falling to the ground.\\n\\n \u0027Look,\u0027 he said, sensing that he had a duty to again try and persuade the other man not to leave, \u0027are you sure you know what you\u0027re doing?\u0027\\n\\n Carl sighed.\\n\\n \u0027Christ, not you as well. I had enough bullshit from Emma earlier...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s not bullshit. We\u0027re just worried that...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Worried that what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 he lied, feeling awkward and reluctant to reveal his true feelings. \u0027I guess we\u0027re just worried that you\u0027re doing the wrong thing. I\u0027ve heard everything you\u0027ve said about wanting to go back to the community centre and I understand why you think you need to go but...\u0027\\n\\n Carl stopped what he was doing and looked at Michael.\\n\\n \u0027But...?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think you\u0027re confused. I think you\u0027ve been through too much to cope with and you\u0027re having trouble dealing with it all. I don\u0027t think you\u0027re capable of making the right decisions at the moment and...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not a fucking lunatic if that\u0027s what you think,\u0027 Carl snapped, his voice surprisingly calm, \u0027I know exactly what I\u0027m doing. The fact is I just don\u0027t feel safe here. And before you say it, I know we\u0027re not safe anywhere anymore, but I obviously feel differently about this place than you two do. That excuse for a fence we built doesn\u0027t make me feel any better...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That excuse for a fence,\u0027 Michael interrupted, annoyed, \u0027kept a thousand of those bastards out last night.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know, but there are millions of them out there. Eventually they\u0027re going to get through.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t agree.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll put a bet on it now and I\u0027ll come back next year and see how you\u0027re doing.\u0027\\n\\n Michael didn\u0027t find Carl\u0027s attempt at black humour amusing.\\n\\n \u0027Okay, so we\u0027re not as isolated as we thought we were here, but we\u0027ve done all right so far, haven\u0027t we?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Better than I ever thought we would,\u0027 he accepted.\\n\\n \u0027So why leave now? You\u0027re going to get ripped to pieces out there.\u0027\\n\\n Carl thought for a moment. He had done a good job of keeping his true feelings and emotions hidden from the other two for most of the last week. The pair of them had been so wrapped up in building and protecting their precious ivory tower that they seemed to have forgotten everything else that was ever important.\\n\\n \u0027I just want to go back to somewhere I know,\u0027 he eventually admitted. \u0027I know I\u0027m taking a massive chance but I think it\u0027s worth the risk. If I\u0027m going to spend the rest of my days hiding from those bloody things out there, I might as well hide somewhere close to the place I know best, somewhere I actually want to be.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But think about the other risks,\u0027 Michael said, his voice tired and low. \u0027Think about the bodies that are just lying rotting on the ground. Every city will be filled with disease.\u0027\\n\\n Carl just shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know anything about that and there\u0027s nothing I can do about it anyway. I used to mend fucking twenty-ton presses for a living, doesn\u0027t matter if you tell me there\u0027s germs and disease about because I can\u0027t do anything about it. I\u0027ll have to take my chances there just the same way you and Emma will do here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But we\u0027re not taking chances...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How do you know that? How do you know that there isn\u0027t cholera, typhoid or a thousand other diseases that we\u0027ve never even heard of already here in the air or in the stream or...\u0027\\n\\n Michael knew he was right. There was no point in arguing.\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t have to go,\u0027 he said, quickly deciding to change tack completely. \u0027Please stay here with us. Just do me a favour and think about it for a couple of days at least will you?\u0027\\n\\n Carl shook his head.\\n\\n \u0027All I\u0027ve done this last week is think about this. Look, it\u0027s nothing personal. You were the one who kept telling us how important it was to look after ourselves, weren\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, but...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So can\u0027t you see that\u0027s all I\u0027m doing. You keep doing what\u0027s best for you and Emma, and I\u0027ll look after myself. We all might be gone tomorrow...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t talk like that,\u0027 Michael interrupted, suddenly angry. \u0027You can\u0027t talk like that if...\u0027\\n\\n Ignoring him, Carl continued.\\n\\n \u0027We might all be gone tomorrow but the three of us might still be around in ten years time. I just can\u0027t lock myself away in here and sit and wait for something to happen. If all we\u0027re going to do is cower and hide for the rest of our lives then we might as well just end it now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I understand what you\u0027re saying,\u0027 Michael sighed, accepting that nothing he could say or do would persuade Carl to stop. \u0027I understand completely, but I still think you\u0027re a stupid fucking bastard.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s your opinion.\u0027\\n\\n Michael stood up and took a step closer before stopping again.\\n\\n \u0027Just stay a little longer, will you? Things might be different again in the morning.\u0027\\n\\n Carl looked up and managed half a smile.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s what scares me,\u0027 he mumbled, sounding tired and resigned. \u0027I can\u0027t stay. I have to go.\u0027\\n\\n Sensing that to prolong the conversation any longer would be pointless, Michael turned and walked back to the house.\\n\\n By six o\u0027clock Carl was ready to leave. His bike, loaded up with his bags, stood next to the gate. Dressed in the leathers and boots taken from corpse in Pennmyre earlier in the day, and carrying the freshly disinfected crash helmet in his hand, he stood at the front door of the farmhouse with Emma and Michael. This was it. He knew that there was no turning back, and no point in delaying the inevitable.\\n\\n He glanced at the other two.\\n\\n \u0027Ready?\u0027 Emma asked.\\n\\n He nodded and swallowed. His mouth was dry.\\n\\n It was a cold night with a relentless, biting wind. Emma zipped up her fleecy jacket and thrust her hands deep into her pockets.\\n\\n \u0027Last time I ask,\u0027 Michael said, fighting to make himself heard over the wind, \u0027are you sure about this?\u0027\\n\\n Carl nodded again.\\n\\n \u0027Better get on with it,\u0027 he said and with that he pulled on his crash helmet. The helmet helped to make him feel further detached from the other two, and that sudden perception of distance made it easier to take the first step and leave.\\n\\n The three survivors walked together towards the bike.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll open the gate,\u0027 Michael said. \u0027You wheel the bike through and start it. Once I hear the engine and see you move, I\u0027m locking up. Okay?\u0027\\n\\n Carl raised a leather clad hand and lifted his thumb to show that he understood. He took one last look over his shoulder at the farmhouse he was leaving and climbed onto the bike. He flicked up the kick-stand with his foot and rolled forward a couple of tentative meters.\\n\\n \u0027Wait by the house,\u0027 Michael said, gesturing for Emma to get back and out of the way. They had no idea what would be waiting for them on the other side of the gate on the bridge. Keen to put maximum distance between her and the rest of the world beyond the barricade, Emma slowly walked backwards towards the house. She watched intently as Michael carefully unlocked each of the eight padlocks and lifted the wooden bar which secured the gate.\\n\\n \u0027Ready?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n Carl stood astride the bike, his hands tightly gripping the handlebars. He nodded.\\n\\n Slowly and cautiously, Michael pushed open one side of the gate. Carl rolled the bike forward again until he sat on the other side of the bridge. Again he glanced over his shoulder and saw that the other man had also taken a few steps forward. He kept hold of the edge of the gate in his hand, ready to slam it shut as soon as Carl had gone. They had only been out there for a few seconds but already Michael could see movement in the bushes.\\n\\n A few seconds later and it was done. Carl lifted his foot and slammed it down on the pedal, starting the bike. The mighty engine spluttered and roared into life sending a cloud of fumes and heat billowing towards Michael. As the first few inquisitive corpses emerged from the shadows of the forest Carl accelerated away. As he pulled the gate closed Michael saw the bike swerve as Carl avoided the first body to have staggered into his path. With shaking hands he lowered the wooden bar back into place and snap-locked each of the heavy padlocks.\\n\\n Emma was standing just a few feet behind Michael. He turned around and her sudden unexpected appearance startled him. He caught his breath and then, instinctively, reached out and held her tight. The warmth of her body was reassuring. He rested his head on her shoulder and cried silent tears for the man who had just left Penn Farm. Michael put his tears down to the wind but he knew in his heart that there was more to them. He found himself suddenly wracked with guilt at having let the other survivor leave.\\n\\n Such was the silence of the evening that almost ten minutes had passed before the sound of Carl\u0027s engine had finally faded away into the night. Emma shivered as she imagined the effect that the noise would have on the lamentable remains of the population of the shattered world through which Carl was now travelling. The roar of the engine and the light from the headlamp would attract the attention of hundreds, probably thousands of bodies, every last one of which would stagger after Carl until he was out of view or earshot. But he would have to stop the bike eventually. What would happen then? It didn\u0027t bear thinking about.\\n\\n It was a bitterly cold night.\\n\\n Once they were completely sure that they could no longer hear the distant sound of the motorbike, Emma and Michael went inside and locked the door of the farmhouse behind them. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1/page-35.html","bookId":2557,"book":{"id":2557,"title":"Autumn (Autumn #1)","description":"Storyline: Autumn (Autumn #1) \\n A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, Autumn chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... \\n Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, Autumn offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-autumn-1.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:48:44 AM"}}
