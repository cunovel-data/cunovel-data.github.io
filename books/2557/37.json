{"id":112062,"no":37,"title":"Page 37","content":"The farmhouse felt as cold and empty inside as the rest of the world was outside. For hours Michael and Emma sat together in total darkness and almost complete silence, both of them thinking constantly about Carl. Whilst they could understand why he had decided to leave, neither could fully agree with what he\u0027d done. Michael\u0027s home seemed a million miles away to him but he knew in his heart that there was nothing worth going back there for. All that he had left behind was familiarity, property and possessions and none of that counted for anything anymore. Sure there were things which had a sentimental value attached that he wished he had with him now, but even those few precious belongings weren\u0027t worth risking his life for. Nevertheless he accepted that Carl had been forced to leave far more behind than he or Emma had. Returning to Northwich would never bring his family back but, if it meant that he could be at peace with himself for the rest of his days, Michael guessed it would be worth taking the chance.\\n\\n Without the generator working the house was dark, cold and uninviting. By late evening the gloom was such that Emma and Michael could hardly see each other despite the fact that they were sitting at opposite ends of the same room. Conversation was sparse. Although both thought of a thousand and one things they wanted to say to the other, neither dared say a word. Both survivors felt disconsolate and empty. Regardless of the fact that Carl had spent most of the last few days locked away in private in his room, it was painfully obvious that he was missing. Everything felt incomplete. Nothing felt the same anymore. And more than that, all that Emma and Michael could think about was what might be happening to their companion out on the road. The more they both thought about it the easier it became to accept what he had done and why he\u0027d done it. The painful part was not knowing whether or not he was still alive. Was he still driving towards Northwich? Had he arrived? Was he with the survivors or had something happened to him along the way? Had the numbers of bodies in the city proved too much for him to deal with? No matter how hard they tried, neither Michael or Emma could clear these constant dark thoughts from their minds. The oppressive atmosphere eventually proved too much for Emma. She went up to the bedroom, preferring for a while to be alone.\\n\\n At midnight Michael had also had enough. He\u0027d spent the last fifty minutes dozing intermittently in his chair and yawning. Each yawn had been long and persistent and they had followed one after the other after the other, leaving his head spinning and his eyes watering. He desperately wanted to sleep but did nothing about it, despite Emma having gone upstairs over an hour earlier. For a while he wondered whether it would even be worth the effort of going up to bed. Once there would he be able to switch his mind off for long enough to be able to sleep? He could have slept in the chair he was sitting in but it was uncomfortable and he would have woken up stiff and aching and still tired. A few minutes after twelve he forced himself to get up and go upstairs.\\n\\n For some reason Michael decided to try and sleep in another room. He and Emma had slept in the same room every night since they\u0027d arrived at Penn Farm. Although he desperately wanted both her company and the reassurance of her presence, tonight he decided that it would be better if he slept elsewhere. Whether he was silently following some subconscious and misguided moral code he didn\u0027t know and he didn\u0027t care. Whatever the reason for using another bedroom it didn\u0027t work. On his own in the dark he couldn\u0027t even bring himself to shut his eyes for more than a couple of seconds, never mind sleep. Less than an hour after first climbing the stairs he lit a candle and quietly traipsed back down again. Trying hard not to make any more noise than was absolutely necessary he made himself a drink, lit a fire in the hearth and sat down to read a book.\\n\\n Twenty minutes later Emma (who had also been unable to sleep and who had become understandably concerned when she\u0027d heard noises downstairs) tiptoed into the living room. Finding Michael curled up in a ball on a rug in front of the fire she reached out and gently shook his shoulder.\\n\\n \u0027Fucking hell!\u0027 he screamed out, spinning round and sitting up in a single frightened movement. \u0027Jesus, you scared the shit out of me. I didn\u0027t know you were down here.\u0027\\n\\n Taken aback by the unexpected strength of his reaction, Emma sat down on the nearest chair. She brought her knees up under her backside and consciously tried to shrink her body down to the smallest possible size. In spite of the fire the house was still bitterly cold.\\n\\n \u0027Sorry,\u0027 she mumbled. \u0027You looked like you were asleep.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re joking aren\u0027t you? I haven\u0027t slept a bloody wink all night.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Me neither.\u0027\\n\\n Michael finished his drink, stretched and looked around the living room. The house felt much bigger tonight - perhaps even too big - and Carl\u0027s sudden leaving was the obvious reason why that seemed to be the case. The room they sat in was filled with random flickering shadows from the fire, trapped indoors as the curtains at all of the windows had been drawn tightly shut. The survivors were afraid to let even the thinnest sliver of light escape out into the night for fear of attracting more of the wandering bodies to the house. When they needed to speak to each other Emma and Michael both instinctively talked in hushed whispers which echoed around the empty house, and when they needed to go into another room they crept through quietly, taking care not to make a single unnecessary sound. They didn\u0027t dare do anything that might alert the outside world to their presence at the farm and the constant oppression was making Michael feel claustrophobic. He wanted to scream or shout or play some music or laugh or do pretty much anything other than sit there and watch the hands on the clock on the wall slowly march round another hour. But they both knew that they couldn\u0027t afford to take any chances.\\n\\n Michael glanced over at Emma sitting curled up on the chair. She looked tired and sad. Her eyes were heavy and she was deep in thought.\\n\\n \u0027Come here,\u0027 he said warmly, holding out his arms to her.\\n\\n Not needing any further encouragement, she slid down from the chair and sat next to him. He gently put his arms round her shoulders and pulled her close. He lightly kissed the top of her head and held her tight.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s bloody cold tonight,\u0027 she whispered.\\n\\n \u0027You tired?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n \u0027Knackered,\u0027 she admitted. \u0027You?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The same. Can\u0027t sleep though.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nor me. Too much going round my mind. I can\u0027t switch off.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t need to ask what you\u0027re thinking about, do I?\u0027\\n\\n She shook her head.\\n\\n \u0027Not really. Difficult to think about anything else, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n Michael held her a little tighter still.\\n\\n \u0027Just wish he\u0027d stopped,\u0027 he said, his voice suddenly sounding unexpectedly strained and cracked with emotion. \u0027I still think I should have stopped him. I should have locked the stupid bastard in his room and not let him leave. I should have...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shh...\u0027 Emma whispered. She pulled back slightly from Michael to allow herself to look deep into his eyes. The low orange flames of the fire highlighted glistening tears which ran freely down his face. \u0027There was nothing that either of us could have done and talking like this is just pointless, we\u0027ve already had this conversation. We both know we would have done more harm than good if we\u0027d tried to stop him...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I just wish he was here now...\u0027 Michael continued, having to force his words out between sobs and deep breaths of air.\\n\\n \u0027I know,\u0027 she whispered, her voice soothing and low.\\n\\n The two friends held each other tightly again. After a brief moment of awkwardness and reluctance they finally both began to cry freely. For the first time since they had lost everything on that desperate autumn morning two weeks ago, they both dropped their guard, relaxed and cried. They cried for all they had lost and left behind, they cried for their absent friend and they cried for each other.\\n\\n The unexpected and much needed outpouring of emotion which Emma and Michael shared acted as a relief valve - diffusing otherwise insurmountable pressure, soothing troubled minds and breaking down unnecessary (and imaginary) barriers. Once their tears had dried (it could have been minutes or hours later - neither was completely sure) they began to relax and then, gradually, to talk freely again. Michael made them both a drink of hot chocolate which they drank together as they watched the fire die.\\n\\n \u0027You know,\u0027 Michael yawned, lying on his back and watching the shadows flickering on the ceiling, \u0027I\u0027d have bought a house like this if I could have afforded it.\u0027\\n\\n Emma, lying at right angles to him with her head resting on his stomach, smiled to herself.\\n\\n \u0027Me too.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Really?\u0027 he asked, lifting himself up onto his elbows and looking across at her.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, really,\u0027 she replied. \u0027It\u0027s a dream house, isn\u0027t it. A lick of paint and it could be beautiful.\u0027\\n\\n He sighed and yawned again.\\n\\n \u0027Apart from half a fucking million rotting bodies on the other side of the fence it\u0027s okay, isn\u0027t it,\u0027 he mumbled sarcastically.\\n\\n Emma ignored him. She tried to stifle a yawn but couldn\u0027t.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m tired,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027Want to go to bed?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n \u0027No point. I won\u0027t sleep.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Me neither.\u0027\\n\\n His elbows aching, Michael lay back down again. He scratched the side of his face and then rubbed his chin. He hadn\u0027t shaved for three or four days. He couldn\u0027t remember exactly how long it had been but it didn\u0027t seem to matter. He put his hands behind his head and basked in front of the fire.\\n\\n \u0027If it wasn\u0027t for the bodies,\u0027 he said, his voice quiet, \u0027then I could put up with this.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What do you mean?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t get me wrong, I wish everything was back as it was,\u0027 he explained. \u0027All I\u0027m saying is that I could deal with it all a lot better if the dead bodies had stayed dead. I can handle there being only a handful of us left, I\u0027m just having trouble coping with the fact that it\u0027s a constant fucking battle.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s not a battle.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes it is,\u0027 he insisted. \u0027Of course it is. If we want food then we have to fight for it. We have to sneak out, grab as much as we can and then sneak back like bloody mice. If we want heat and light then we have to be ready to be surrounded by those frigging things outside. It\u0027s a fucking battle and it\u0027s not fair.\u0027\\n\\n For a second Michael sounded like a spoilt child. But Emma knew that he was right and she agreed with everything he said. Had it not been punishment enough to have lost everything that ever mattered to them? Why now did they have to continue to suffer like this?\\n\\n \u0027And what really gets me,\u0027 he continued, \u0027is the fact that the bloody things are already dead. You can\u0027t kill them. I bet if you put a fucking bullet between their eyes they\u0027d still keep coming at you.\u0027\\n\\n Emma didn\u0027t respond. She knew it was important for him to talk but this was a conversation that she didn\u0027t particularly want to prolong. She reminded herself that it was obviously doing Michael good. For too long they had each kept their fears and emotions bottled up for fear of upsetting the other two and disturbing the fragile peace and shelter that they\u0027d found at Penn Farm. In the last twenty-four hours Carl had proved that holding onto private pain and frustration was not necessarily the best thing to do. His internal conflict and personal torture had driven him to take action which, from where she was standing, appeared tantamount to suicide.\\n\\n \u0027Want another drink?\u0027 Michael asked, disturbing her train of thought.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 she mumbled, only half-listening.\\n\\n \u0027I asked if you wanted another drink.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No thanks. Do you want one?\u0027\\n\\n He shook his head.\\n\\n \u0027So why did you ask then?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t know. Just something to say I suppose.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s wrong with saying nothing.\u0027\\n\\n Michael covered his eyes.\\n\\n \u0027Too quiet,\u0027 he replied.\\n\\n \u0027And what\u0027s wrong with silence?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It lets you think too much.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t you want to think?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, not any more. I want a break from thinking.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But that\u0027s a stupid thing to say. You\u0027re always thinking, aren\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n He yawned, stretched his arms and then pulled them back and covered his face again.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s thinking and there\u0027s thinking, isn\u0027t there?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is there?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course there is. Have you ever sat down with a group of friends and talked about nothing in particular?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Have you ever had one of those pointless conversations where you spend hours discussing really bloody stupid things? You know, when you find yourself arguing about the colour of your favourite superhero\u0027s shorts or something like that?\u0027\\n\\n Emma smiled.\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t ever remember talking about superhero\u0027s shorts, but I know what you mean.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I remember when I was a kid, in the summer holidays, we\u0027d get up early and disappear into the park for hours. We\u0027d be there for most of the day and we wouldn\u0027t actually do anything. We\u0027d walk around and play and fight and...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You need to switch off,\u0027 Emma said as Michael\u0027s voice trailed away into silence. \u0027We both do. We weren\u0027t designed for this kind of life. Your mind and body can\u0027t cope if you keep going at full speed all the time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So when are you and me going to switch off then?\u0027 he asked. \u0027When are we going to be able to do something without worrying about the consequences?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because I think you\u0027re right, we\u0027re both going to need to, Em. I think that somehow we\u0027re going to have to try and find a way to do it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Meditation,\u0027 Emma suggested. \u0027We could meditate in shifts.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are you taking the piss?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, I\u0027m serious. Like you say, we\u0027ve got to learn to switch off and disconnect from everything. If we don\u0027t then one or even both of us will probably lose it big time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So when was the last time you managed to switch off and disconnect?\u0027 he asked, semiseriously.\\n\\n Emma thought carefully for a couple of seconds.\\n\\n \u0027About six months ago,\u0027 she laughed.\\n\\n Once their frustrations had been aired and discussed, Michael and Emma talked for hours. Their long and rambling conversation covered everything and nothing.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re you born in Northwich, Mike?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just outside. What about you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, I just studied there.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did you like it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It was okay.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just okay?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, it was okay.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I liked it. All right so it had it\u0027s fair share of penthouses and it\u0027s fair share of shit-holes but everywhere does. It was home.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I much prefer being out in a place like this. Not at the moment, of course, but before all this happened I was always happier out in the country away from the noise and the concrete and the people.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And me. I used to try and get away as often as I could. I\u0027d just get in the car and drive for a couple of hours and see where I ended up. I\u0027d go and lie down in a field or walk along a river or something...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Didn\u0027t go fishing did you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because I hate fishing. It\u0027s a bloody barbaric sport.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bloody boring sport.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I used to camp. I\u0027d pack a rucksack and a tent and catch a lift to somewhere remote.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And then what would you do.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nothing.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Emma, do you miss the television?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I miss the noise and normality of it, but not much else.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I miss the weather.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The weather?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I never realised how much I relied on weather forecasts until now. I really miss knowing what the weather\u0027s going to do next.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Doesn\u0027t matter anymore though, does it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Suppose not. It didn\u0027t really matter anyway but I still want to know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just looking at the telly switched off reminds me of everything that\u0027s gone now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did you used to watch a lot of films?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I used to watch more films than anything else.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And I bet you never really listened to the radio.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, not very often. Why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve got this theory that people who watched a lot of films and who didn\u0027t listen to the radio always had strong personalities.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How do you work that out?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because you\u0027re the kind of person who knows what you want if you don\u0027t listen to the radio. If you listen to the radio you have to sit through hours of crap music, crap adverts and pointless conversations just to get to hear to a couple of minutes of something you like.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I suppose. I\u0027m not convinced though.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I never listened to the radio, not even in the car. I was always a CD or cassette man. You always knew where you were with a cassette.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So how\u0027s this all going to end, Em?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What do you mean?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. Are things ever going to sort themselves out?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I doubt it. Bloody stupid question really.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know, sorry.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think it\u0027ll get worse before it gets any better.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Think so? Shit, how could it get any worse?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Disease. There are millions of bodies lying rotting in the streets, aren\u0027t there?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What about insects then?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What about them?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Rotting bodies and more disease is going to mean more insects, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It might do. Probably.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And rats. There are going to be fucking hundreds of rats about in the cities.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Emma, is there anybody you can think of that you\u0027re glad is dead?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bloody hell, what kind of a question is that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Come on, be honest. Is there anyone out of all the people you knew who you\u0027re actually glad is dead?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. Christ, you\u0027re sick at times.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No I\u0027m not, I just don\u0027t bother with bullshit. There were a few people in my life who I\u0027m happy aren\u0027t about anymore.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Like who?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I worked with a bloke who was a complete bastard. He had a wife who just doted on him. She\u0027d have done absolutely anything to make him happy. She had two part-time jobs as well as looking after three kids.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And what did he do?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nothing. Absolutely bloody nothing. He was qualified and everything, just couldn\u0027t be bothered to get off his backside and do anything with his life.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So why did you want him dead? What did he ever do to you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t say I wanted him dead. He didn\u0027t do anything to me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So why did you hate him?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t say I hated him. He used to be quite a laugh actually.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So why are you happy he\u0027s dead?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t know really. He just always pissed me off. Suppose it was because I couldn\u0027t be that way. He was just a waste of space. He didn\u0027t add anything to his family, he just took from them. It never seemed right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you think you would have got married?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t know. Probably. I would have liked to have settled down and had a family eventually.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So did you ever get close?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. I always thought I\u0027d know instantly when I met the woman I was going to marry, but it never happened.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I got engaged when I was eighteen.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How old are you now? Christ, I can\u0027t believe I\u0027ve never asked your age before.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m twenty-three.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So why didn\u0027t it work out?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because I was left doing all the work while he sat on his backside, same as your mate and his wife. Jesus, he broke my heart. I would have done just about anything for him but he wasn\u0027t prepared to do anything for me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So you must be glad that he\u0027s not around?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not really. Actually I still miss him.\u0027\\n\\n Another hour and the virtually constant stream of questions, revelations and personal admissions had all but dried up. By three o\u0027clock the two of them were sprawled out together on the rug in front of what remained of the fire, relaxing in the fading warmth of the lightly glowing embers. Michael woke up when Emma shuffled in her sleep and snored. In turn his sudden startled movements woke her.\\n\\n \u0027You okay?\u0027 he asked as he untangled himself from her legs. Their bodies had become innocently twisted together in the night.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m all right,\u0027 she mumbled, her words dulled with sleep.\\n\\n Michael dragged himself up onto all fours and shuffled round until he was in a similar position to Emma. Exhausted, he collapsed back down next to her. He instinctively reached out and put his arms around her body, holding her tightly and subconsciously shielding and protecting her from anything that might happen in the remaining dark hours of the night. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1/page-37.html","bookId":2557,"book":{"id":2557,"title":"Autumn (Autumn #1)","description":"Storyline: Autumn (Autumn #1) \\n A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, Autumn chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease.

Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence.
