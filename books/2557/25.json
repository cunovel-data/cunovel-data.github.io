Carl followed seconds later and, as the second man entered the building, Michael slammed the door shut behind him and locked it. Emma slid down the wall at the bottom of the stairs and held her head in her hands.\n \u0027Christ knows,\u0027 she sighed, exhausted and out of breath.\n Carl barged back past Michael to peer through one of the small glass windows in the front door.\n \u0027Shit,\u0027 he hissed under his breath. \u0027There are loads of them out there, bloody loads of them. I can see at least ten from here.\u0027\n He seemed strangely fascinated by everything that was happening outside. While Emma and Michael were content to shut the door and lock themselves away from the rest of the nightmare world, Carl was pumped full of adrenaline. Almost ready, it seemed, for a fight.\n Michael sat down on the stairs next to Emma and gently rested his hand on her shoulder.\n \u0027They\u0027ve changed,\u0027 she said, her head still held low. \u0027I don\u0027t know what\u0027s happened or why but they\u0027ve changed.\u0027\n \u0027I know. I saw it last night,\u0027 he whispered, \u0027when you and Carl were asleep.\u0027\n Emma looked up.\n \u0027What happened?\u0027\n \u0027I went out to shut off the generator and there were four of them hanging around outside the shed.\u0027\n \u0027You didn\u0027t say anything...\u0027\n \u0027I didn\u0027t think anything of it until now. Anyway, as soon as I switched off the generator they disappeared.\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t think they\u0027re coming any closer,\u0027 Carl said, his face still pressed hard against the glass, still ignorant to their conversation. \u0027Looks like they\u0027re starting to move away again.\u0027\n \u0027Which way are they going?\u0027 Michael asked.\n \u0027Not sure. Might be heading towards the back of the house.\u0027\n \u0027Back to the generator?\u0027 Emma wondered.\n \u0027Could be, why?\u0027\n She shrugged her shoulders and held her head again.\n \u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 she mumbled, rubbing her tired and tearstained eyes. \u0027Last night, did those bodies leave as soon as the generator was switched off?\u0027\n \u0027I think so,\u0027 Michael replied.\n \u0027Well that\u0027s it then, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027 he pressed, suddenly feeling a little foolish and confused because although she seemed to understand some of what was happening, he didn\u0027t have a clue. He respected Emma\u0027s opinion but wished that he could understand for himself what was happening to the once human shells wandering around the desolate countryside. She may only have been a part-qualified doctor (if that) but that part-qualification seemed to make her the last surviving authority on what remained of the human condition.\n \u0027They\u0027re starting to regain their senses.\u0027\n \u0027But why? Why now?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. Remember how they suddenly got up and started moving around?\u0027\n \u0027Yes...\u0027\n \u0027So this must be the same thing.\u0027\n \u0027What the hell are you talking about?\u0027 Carl interrupted, turning from events outside to face the others and join their conversation.\n \u0027Don\u0027t know really,\u0027 she admitted. \u0027Perhaps they weren\u0027t as badly damaged as we first thought.\u0027\n \u0027Jesus,\u0027 he laughed, unable to believe what he was hearing. \u0027They couldn\u0027t have been much more badly damaged, could they? They we\u0027re dead for Christ\u0027s sake!\u0027\n \u0027I know that,\u0027 she sighed. \u0027So maybe it\u0027s just a small part of them that\u0027s survived. The only reactions we\u0027ve seen have been basic and instinctive. I was taught that there\u0027s a lump of jelly right in the middle of the brain that might be responsible for instinct. Maybe that\u0027s the part of them that\u0027s still alive?\u0027\n \u0027But they didn\u0027t attack me last night, did they?\u0027 Michael reminded her. \u0027I walked right past those bastards and...\u0027\n \u0027Perhaps they were only just starting to respond last night? This is a gradual thing. From what you\u0027ve told me it seems possible that they\u0027ve only been like this for a few hours.\u0027\n \u0027This sounds like bullshit,\u0027 Carl snapped angrily.\n \u0027I know it does,\u0027 Emma admitted, \u0027but you come up with a better explanation and I\u0027ll listen. One morning everyone drops down dead. A few days later, half of them get up and start walking around again. A few days after that and they start responding to the outside world and their eyes and ears start working again. You\u0027re completely right, Carl, it stinks. It does sounds like bullshit...\u0027\n \u0027But it\u0027s happening,\u0027 Michael reminded him. \u0027Doesn\u0027t matter how ridiculous or far-fetched any of it sounds, it\u0027s happening out there.\u0027\n \u0027I know, but...\u0027 Carl began.\n \u0027But nothing,\u0027 he interrupted. \u0027These are the facts and we\u0027ve got to deal with them. Simple as that.\u0027\n The conversation ended abruptly and the house became deathly silent. The lack of noise unnerved Carl.\n \u0027So why did that thing attack you?\u0027 he asked, looking directly towards Michael for answer he knew the other man could not give.\n \u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 he admitted.\n \u0027I\u0027m sure it\u0027s sound they respond to first,\u0027 Emma said. \u0027They hear something and turn towards it. Once they see what it is they try and get closer.\u0027\n \u0027That makes sense...\u0027 Michael began.\n \u0027Nothing makes sense,\u0027 Carl muttered. Ignoring him, Michael continued.\n \u0027The noise from the generator last night, the gunshot this morning...\u0027\n \u0027So we\u0027ve just got to stay quiet and stay out of sight,\u0027 she sighed.\n \u0027And how the hell are we going to do that?\u0027 Carl demanded, suddenly and unexpectedly furious. \u0027Where are you going to get a fucking silent car from? What are we going to do, go out to get our food on fucking push-bikes? Wearing fucking camouflage jackets?\u0027\n \u0027Shut up,\u0027 Michael said, calmly but firmly. \u0027You\u0027ve got to try and deal with this, Carl.\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t patronise me you bastard,\u0027 Carl hissed.\n \u0027Look,\u0027 Emma snapped, standing up and positioning herself directly between the two men, \u0027will both of you please shut up? It\u0027s like Michael says, Carl, we\u0027ve got no option but to try and deal with this as best we can...\u0027\n \u0027So what are we going to do then?\u0027 he asked, a little calmer but with his voice still shaking with an equal mixture of frustrated anger and fear.\n \u0027We need to get more supplies,\u0027 Michael said quietly. \u0027If they are becoming more aware and more dangerous all the time then I think we should go out right now and get as much stuff as we can carry. Then we should get ourselves back here as quickly as we can and lie low for a while.\u0027\n \u0027And how long is that likely to be?\u0027 Carl asked, clearly beginning to wind himself up again. \u0027A week, two weeks? A month? Ten fucking years?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 the other man replied, equally agitated. \u0027How the hell should I know that?\u0027\n \u0027Shut up!\u0027 Emma yelled, immediately silencing the other two. \u0027For Christ\u0027s sake, if neither of you can say anything without arguing then don\u0027t bother saying anything at all.\u0027\n \u0027Sorry,\u0027 Michael mumbled, running his fingers through his matted hair.\n \u0027So what are we going to do?\u0027 she asked.\n Rather than answer or take any further part in the increasingly difficult conversation, Carl walked away.\n \u0027Where are you going? Carl, come back here. We need to talk about this.\u0027\n Halfway up the stairs he stopped and turned back around to face her.\n \u0027What\u0027s left to talk about? What\u0027s the point.\u0027\n \u0027The point is we\u0027ve got to do something and I think we should do it now,\u0027 Michael said. \u0027We don\u0027t know what\u0027s going to happen next, do we? Things could be a hundred times worse tomorrow.\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s right,\u0027 agreed Emma. \u0027We\u0027ve got enough stuff here to last us for a few days but we need enough to last us weeks. I think we should get out now and barricade ourselves in when we get back.\u0027\n \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 asked Carl, now much quieter and calmer. He sat down on the stair he\u0027d been standing on. \u0027I don\u0027t want to shut myself away in here...\u0027\n \u0027Maybe we shouldn\u0027t,\u0027 Michael said. \u0027Maybe we should try it a different way, try and seal off the farm from the outside.\u0027\n \u0027And how are we supposed to do that?\u0027 Emma wondered.\n \u0027Build a fence,\u0027 he replied, simply.\n \u0027It\u0027d have to be a fucking strong fence,\u0027 Carl added.\n \u0027Then we\u0027ll build a fucking strong fence,\u0027 Michael explained. \u0027We\u0027ll get whatever materials we need today and make a start. Face it we\u0027re not going to find anywhere better to stay than this place. We need to protect it.\u0027\n \u0027We need to protect ourselves,\u0027 said Emma, correcting him.\n \u0027Let\u0027s go,\u0027 he said, picking up the keys to the van from a hook on the wall by the front door.\n \u0027Now?\u0027 said Carl.\n \u0027Now,\u0027 he replied.\n Michael opened the door and made his way to the van, stopping only to pick up the rifle from where Carl had left it in the yard in front of the house. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1/page-25.html","bookId":2557,"book":{"id":2557,"title":"Autumn (Autumn #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Autumn (Autumn #1) \n A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, Autumn chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... \n Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, Autumn offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-autumn-1.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:48:44 AM"}}
