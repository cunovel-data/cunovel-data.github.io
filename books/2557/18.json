{"id":112044,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"Michael was asleep by eight o\u0027clock. Curled up on a sofa in the sitting room of the rustic farmhouse, it was the best and most unexpected sleep he\u0027d had since the disaster had begun. Fate had dealt everyone some bitterly cruel hands recently but, for this one man at least, a welcome respite in the nightmare had arrived.\\n\\n The house was silent save for his gentle snoring and the muffled sounds of Emma and Carl\u0027s tired conversation. Although they were easily as tired as Michael, neither felt able to close their eyes for even a second. No matter how comfortable and peaceful their surroundings had unexpectedly become, they knew that the world beyond the walls of the building was as inhospitable and fucked up as it had been since the first minutes of the tragedy last week.\\n\\n \u0027I could have tried to get it going tonight,\u0027 Carl yawned, still talking about the generator in the shed behind the house. \u0027I just couldn\u0027t be bothered though. We\u0027ve got plenty of time. I\u0027ll try it in the morning.\u0027\\n\\n Thinking about repairing the machinery had made him feel strangely relaxed. It reminded him of the job he used to do. He was looking forward to getting on with the job tomorrow and hoped that, for a short time at least, the grease and graft would allow him to imagine that he was back at work and that the last few days had never happened.\\n\\n Emma and Carl sat on either side of the fireplace, wrapped up in their coats because the room was surprisingly cold. Michael had prepared a fire earlier but they had decided against lighting it for fear of the smoke drawing attention to their location. Their fear was irrational but undeniable. Chances were they were the only living people for miles around but they didn\u0027t want to take any risks, no matter how slight. Anonymity seemed to add to their security.\\n\\n The large room was comfortably dark. A low, dancing orange light came from three candles which cast strange, flickering shadows on the walls. After an awkward silence that had lasted for a good ten minutes, Emma spoke.\\n\\n \u0027Do you think we\u0027re going to be all right here?\u0027 she asked cautiously.\\n\\n \u0027We should be okay for a while,\u0027 Carl replied, his voice quiet and hushed.\\n\\n \u0027I like it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s okay.\u0027\\n\\n The staccato conversation died quickly. Next time it was Carl who disturbed the quiet.\\n\\n \u0027Emma, you don\u0027t think...\u0027\\n\\n He stopped before he\u0027d finished his question, obviously unsure of himself.\\n\\n \u0027Think what?\u0027 she pushed.\\n\\n He cleared his throat and shuffled awkwardly in his seat. With some reluctance he began again.\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t think the farmer will come back, do you?\u0027\\n\\n As soon as he\u0027d spoken he regretted what he\u0027d said. It sounded so bloody ridiculous when he said it out loud but, nonetheless, the body of the farmer had been playing on his mind all evening. These days death didn\u0027t seem to have the same finality as it always had done before and he wondered if the old man might somehow find his way back to his home and try to reclaim what was rightfully his. He knew that they could get rid of him again if they needed to and that in a reanimated state he would pose little threat, but it was just the thought of the body returning which unnerved him. His thoughts were irrational but even so the hairs on the back of his neck had again begun to tingle and prickle with cool fear.\\n\\n Emma shook her head.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 he blathered. \u0027Stupid thing to say. Bloody stupid thing to say.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t worry about it,\u0027 she insisted. \u0027It\u0027s okay.\u0027\\n\\n Emma turned away from Carl and watched a ghostly whisper of grey smoke snake away from the top of the candle nearest to her and dissolve into the air. She sensed that Carl was watching her and, for a moment, that made her feel suddenly and unexpectedly uneasy. She wondered if he could sense what she was thinking. She wondered if he knew that she shared his own deep, dark and unfounded fears about the body of the farmer. Logic told her that they would be all right and that he would stay down - after all, the bodies seemed to have risen en mass last week - they\u0027d either dragged themselves up on that one cold morning or they\u0027d stayed where they\u0027d fallen and died. And even if Mr Jones did somehow rise up and start to walk again, his movements would be as random, stilted and uncoordinated as the rest of the wandering corpses. Pure chance was the only thing that would ever bring him back home. She knew that nothing was going to happen and that they were wasting their time thinking about the dead man but she still couldn\u0027t help herself.\\n\\n \u0027All right?\u0027 Carl asked quietly.\\n\\n She turned and smiled and nodded and then turned back and looked at the burning candle again. She stared into the flickering yellow flame and thought back to a couple of hours earlier when the three of them had shifted the body of the farmer and that of a farm hand that they\u0027d found fallen at the side of the garage. Mr Jones had been the most difficult corpse to get rid of. He had once been a burly, well-built man who, she imagined, had worked every available hour of every day to ensure that his farm ran smoothly and profitably. By the time that Carl and Michael had got around to shifting his awkward bulk, however, his limbs had been stiffened and contorted by rigor mortis. She had watched with horror and disgust as one of the men had taken hold of his shoulders and the other his legs. With a lack of respect they had dragged him unceremoniously through what used to be his home. She recalled the look of irritation so clear on Michael\u0027s face when they hadn\u0027t been able to manoeuvre the farmer\u0027s clumsy bulk through the front door.\\n\\n They had taken the two bodies into the pine forest which bordered the farm. Michael and Carl had shared the weight of the corpses (making two trips) and she had carried three shovels from the house. She remembered what happened next with an icy clarity.\\n\\n After laying the bodies out on the ground Michael had turned to walk back towards the house. Emma and Carl had instinctively picked up a shovel each and begun to dig.\\n\\n \u0027What the hell are you doing?\u0027 Michael had asked.\\n\\n \u0027Digging,\u0027 Carl had replied. His answer had been factually correct, but he had completely missed the other man\u0027s point.\\n\\n \u0027Digging what?\u0027\\n\\n Thinking for a moment that he had been asked a trick question, Carl had paused before answering.\\n\\n \u0027Graves of course,\u0027 he replied before adding a cautious; \u0027Why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That was what I was going to ask you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What do you mean?\u0027\\n\\n Emma had been standing directly between the two men, watching the conversation develop.\\n\\n \u0027Why bother? What\u0027s the point?\u0027 Michael had protested.\\n\\n \u0027Pardon?\u0027 she\u0027d interrupted.\\n\\n \u0027Why bother digging graves?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027To put the bloody bodies in,\u0027 Carl snapped, annoyed that he was being questioned. \u0027Is there a problem?\u0027\\n\\n Instead of answering Michael had just asked another question.\\n\\n \u0027So when are you going to do the rest?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 Emma had sighed.\\n\\n \u0027If you\u0027re going to bury these two,\u0027 he had explained, \u0027then you might as well finish the job off and bury the fucking thousands of other corpses lying round the country.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t be stupid,\u0027 Carl had protested angrily. \u0027We can\u0027t...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027For Christ\u0027s sake just look around you. There must be millions of bodies and not one of them has been buried. More to the point, none of them needs to be either...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Listen, we\u0027ve taken this man\u0027s home from him. Don\u0027t you think that at the very least we owe him...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 Michael interrupted, his voice infuriatingly calm and level. \u0027We don\u0027t owe him anything.\u0027\\n\\n At that point he had turned and walked back towards the farmhouse. The light had started to fade with a frightening speed and he had almost been out of view when he\u0027d shouted back to the others over his shoulder.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m going back inside,\u0027 he\u0027d yelled. \u0027I\u0027m cold and I\u0027m tired and I can\u0027t be bothered wasting any more time out here. There are all kind of things wandering round out here and I...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All we\u0027re doing is...\u0027 Carl had replied.\\n\\n Michael had stopped and turned back around.\\n\\n \u0027All you\u0027re doing is wasting time. The two of you are standing out here risking your necks trying to do something that doesn\u0027t even need to be done. I\u0027m going back inside.\u0027\\n\\n With that he had gone, and Carl and Emma had been left alone with the two lifeless bodies at their feet. They had stood together in silence, both unsure as to what they should do next. For a second Emma had been distracted. She thought she\u0027d seen movement deeper in the forest. She wasn\u0027t sure, but she thought that she had caught a glimpse of another body staggering through the trees a short distance away. The thought of more bodies being close by made the cold night feel colder still and had returned her attention to the corpses on the ground.\\n\\n Emma had been annoyed by Michael\u0027s attitude and manner, but what upset her most of all was the fact that he was right. He was cold, heartless and unfeeling but he was right. Whether they had wanted to bury the body out of duty to the farmer or out of instinct it didn\u0027t matter. The burial would have served no real purpose other than to make the two of them feel a little better and less guilty about what they were doing. But they were simply trying to survive. The farmhouse and everything in it was no use to Mr Jones any longer.\\n\\n In the fading light they had reached a silent compromise. Rather than bury the bodies they had instead just placed a light covering of loose soil and fallen autumn leaves over the two dead men.\\n\\n \u0027What are you thinking about?\u0027 Carl asked, suddenly distracting Emma and bringing her crashing back into the cold reality of the living room.\\n\\n \u0027Nothing,\u0027 she lied.\\n\\n Carl stretched out in the chair and yawned.\\n\\n \u0027What do we do next then?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n Emma shrugged.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t know. If you\u0027re talking about tonight I think we should try and get some sleep. If you mean in the morning, I\u0027m not sure. We need to decide if we\u0027re going to stay here first of all.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What do you think? Do you think we should stay here or...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think we\u0027d be stupid to leave right now,\u0027 said Michael, surprising the other two who turned to look at him. He had been sound asleep just a few moments earlier and his sudden interruption had startled Carl and Emma.\\n\\n \u0027How long have you been awake?\u0027 Carl asked.\\n\\n \u0027Not long,\u0027 he yawned. \u0027Anyway, in answer to your question, I think we should stay here for a while and see what happens.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nothing\u0027s going to happen,\u0027 Emma mumbled.\\n\\n \u0027I bloody well hope you\u0027re right,\u0027 he said, yawning again. \u0027I think we should spend tomorrow trying to find out exactly what we\u0027ve got here. If we\u0027re safe, sheltered and secure then I think we should stop.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I agree,\u0027 said Carl. He kept his motives hidden well. It wasn\u0027t that Carl particularly wanted to stay in the farmhouse, it was just that, for a few days at least, he didn\u0027t want to go anywhere else. In the journey from the city he had seen more death, carnage and destruction than he\u0027d ever thought possible. The old, strong walls of the house protected him from the rest of the shattered world.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m going to bed,\u0027 Michael said as he stood up and stretched. \u0027I could sleep for a week.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1/page-18.html","bookId":2557,"book":{"id":2557,"title":"Autumn (Autumn #1)","description":"Storyline: Autumn (Autumn #1) \\n A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, Autumn chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... \\n Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, Autumn offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-autumn-1.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:48:44 AM"}}
