{"id":112046,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"It was twenty past nine before Michael, Carl and Emma actually sat down together in the same room. They were in the kitchen. Carl and Emma sat in stony silence opposite each other around a circular pine table while Michael struggled to scrape together some breakfast from the meagre scraps remaining of the limited supplies they\u0027d brought with them from the city.\n The atmosphere at Penn Farm was heavy and subdued. Michael felt low - perhaps lower than he had done at any time during the last few days - and he was struggling to understand why. He\u0027d expected to feel a little better today. The three of them had, after all, stumbled upon a place where they could shelter safely for a while. A place which offered isolation and protection and yet which was still comfortable and spacious. He looked out through the wide kitchen window and down onto the farmyard below and decided that it must have been the slight elation they\u0027d felt last night that was making the cold reality of this morning so hard to accept.\n The baked beans he had been cooking had started to stick to the bottom of the pan and spoil.\n \u0027Something burning?\u0027 Carl mumbled perceptively.\n Michael grunted and stirred and scraped the beans with a wooden spoon. He hated cooking. The reason he was preparing the meal this morning was the same reason he\u0027d been the first to cook food at the community centre back in Northwich. He had no community spirit and no real desire to please the others. Cooking was nothing more than a brief distraction. Rescuing the burning beans somehow stopped him from thinking about the world outside and all that he had lost for a few precious seconds.\n Dejected and distant, he served up the food and carried the first two plates over to the table. Emma and Carl looked at the breakfasts which clattered down in front of them with disdain and disinterest as neither was feeling at all hungry. Each plate had on it a large serving of baked beans, a dollop of stodgy scrambled egg (prepared from a dehydrated mix usually used by mountaineers) and three hot dog sausages which had been boiled in brine. Emma managed half a smile in acknowledgement but Carl did not. He sniffed and stared at his food feeling exhausted and nauseous.\n Emma picked up a fork and began to poke and prod gingerly at the food. She looked across at the other two and noticed that they were both doing the same. Each one of the survivors seemed to be trying their damnedest not to say or do anything that might result in them having to talk to or even look at the others. All three of them were being gripped tight and suffocated by a now familiar paradox - they each craved the security and normality of conversation, but they knew that such a conversation would inevitably lead to them talking about things that they were each doing their best to try and forget.\n As the long minutes dragged on, Emma\u0027s patience wore thin. Eventually she cracked.\n \u0027Look,\u0027 she sighed, \u0027are we just going to sit here or should we actually think about doing something constructive today?\u0027\n Michael looked up and rubbed his tired eyes. Carl started to eat his food. Filling his mouth with burnt beans, undercooked sausage and powdered egg gave him an excuse not to have to talk.\n \u0027Well?\u0027 Emma pressed angrily.\n \u0027We\u0027ve got to do something,\u0027 Michael quietly agreed. \u0027I don\u0027t know what yet, but we\u0027ve got to do something...\u0027\n \u0027We need some decent food,\u0027 she said, pushing her untouched breakfast away.\n Michael thought for a moment.\n \u0027There\u0027s bound to be other things we need too.\u0027\n \u0027Such as?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know...clothes, tools, petrol...\u0027\n \u0027We need to know what we\u0027ve got here first.\u0027\n Carl watched Emma and Michael intently as they spoke, following the conversation, looking from face to face.\n \u0027You\u0027re right. First thing we should do is go through this house from top to bottom and see exactly what we\u0027ve got. Space is going to be limited in the van so we don\u0027t want to be doubling up on anything.\u0027 Michael paused to take a breath. \u0027Carl, do you know what you\u0027ll need for the generator?\u0027\n Startled by the sudden mention of his name, Carl dropped his fork.\n \u0027What?\u0027\n Michael frowned.\n \u0027Do you know what you need to get the generator sorted?\u0027 he repeated, annoyed that the other man hadn\u0027t been listening.\n He shook his head.\n \u0027No, not yet. I\u0027ll have a look later and try and work it out.\u0027\n \u0027We should get it done straight after breakfast,\u0027 Emma suggested. \u0027I think we should check the house out from top to bottom then get out, get what we need and get back as quickly as we can.\u0027\n \u0027The sooner we get started,\u0027 Michael added, \u0027the sooner we get back.\u0027\n He didn\u0027t need to say anything else. Emma was already up and out of her seat. She scraped her untouched food into a black plastic rubbish sack and swilled the plate in a bowl of cold water in the sink. Without saying another word she quickly smiled at the two men still sitting at the table and ran upstairs to start working, cleaning and searching her way through the farmhouse.\n Prompted to move by Emma\u0027s sudden actions, Michael too jumped up and started to busy himself. Carl on the other hand was in no rush. He stayed sat at the table toying with - and occasionally eating - the cold food on his plate.\n Last night the three survivors had made an unspoken agreement to stay at Penn Farm for the time being. It seemed relatively safe, secure and comfortable and had the potential to be much, much more. It was only as they scoured the house for supplies that the true potential of their location finally became apparent to Emma and Michael. Carl acknowledged it too, but he was still unsure. He wasn\u0027t yet completely convinced that they were safe anywhere.\n Emma began at the top of the house and worked her way down. She started in an odd-shaped attic bedroom which Carl had quickly claimed as his own yesterday. The dull room was lit only by the light which trickled in through a small window at the front of the house. Other than a bed, a wardrobe and a couple of other items of furniture there was little of note to be found there.\n Michael worked his way through the rooms on the second floor. Three more reasonably sized bedrooms and an old-fashioned but practical bathroom. He uncovered little that he didn\u0027t expect to find. Clothes (far too old, large and worn for any of them to consider wearing), personal possessions and trinkets and little else. As he sat on the edge of the large double bed that Emma had slept on last night and looked through an obviously antique jewellery box he found himself suddenly fascinated by the value of the items it held. Less than a month ago the rings, earrings, necklaces, bracelets and brooches (which, he presumed, had belonged to Mrs Jones - what had happened to her?) would have been worth a small fortune. Today they were worth nothing. Conversely the comfort of the wooden-framed bed he was sitting on made it worth millions in his eyes.\n By the time Carl forced himself to get up and go outside the other two had almost finished. They met in the hallway and walked to the back door where they stood together and planned their next move. Buoyed by the unexpected novelty of finally having had something constructive and purposeful to do for a short while, Emma and Michael talked with what could almost have been classed as enthusiasm about the rest of the day which lay ahead of them. Michael had a grand plan to fill the van with supplies, make themselves safe in the grounds of the house and get the generator working. Much as it still reminded him of everything he\u0027d lost, his aim was to get a television or stereo working by the time darkness fell. He wanted to bring beer back to the house so that he could drink and forget. He knew that it would only be an illusion of normality, and he also knew that when it finished the pain of reality would be almost unbearable, but that didn\u0027t seem to matter. He knew that the three of them were mentally and physically exhausted. If they didn\u0027t force themselves to stop soon then it would only be a matter of time before someone cracked. He was damn sure that, having survived so far, he wasn\u0027t about to go under. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1/page-20.html","bookId":2557,"book":{"id":2557,"title":"Autumn (Autumn #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Autumn (Autumn #1) \n A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, Autumn chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... \n Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, Autumn offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-autumn-1.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:48:44 AM"}}
