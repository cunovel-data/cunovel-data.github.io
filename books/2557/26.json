{"id":112051,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"Carl drove the van while Michael and Emma sat in the back together drawing up a list of everything they could think they might need. It had been a conscious move by Michael to hand the keys over to the other man. He hadn\u0027t liked the way Carl had been acting this morning. Sure all three of them were right on the edge at the moment, but his position seemed more precarious than that of the other two. There was an undeniable air of uncertainty and fear in his voice every time he spoke. Michael\u0027s logic was that by distracting him and giving him a definite role to concentrate on, his mind would be occupied and any problems could be temporarily avoided. He could sympathise with the poor bastard entirely. He knew that he personally could just about handle what was going on around him at the moment, but if anything else happened he wasn\u0027t so sure that he\u0027d be able to cope.\n Less than two minutes trying to draw up the list and the two survivors stopped, both of them quickly realising that it was a waste of their precious time and that they couldn\u0027t afford to even try and be specific anymore. Truth was they couldn\u0027t risk wasting time trying to find the things they thought they might need, instead they had no option but to fill the van with whatever they could lay their hands on and only stop when there wasn\u0027t space for anything else.\n Carl drove towards the village of Byster at a phenomenal speed. Michael silently wished that he would slow down but he knew that he wouldn\u0027t. He\u0027d found himself accelerating at a similar rate whenever he\u0027d driven recently. Driving was deceptively difficult because although silent, every road was strewn with hundreds upon hundreds of random obstacles - crashed and abandoned cars, burnt out wrecks and the remains of collapsed buildings. There were scattered, motionless corpses and scores of other wandering bodies everywhere. When Michael had driven he\u0027d found that a nervous pressure had forced him to keep accelerating. He felt sure that Carl was feeling that same clammy, noxious fear too.\n Before they reached the village they passed a vast, warehouse-like supermarket, brightly painted and completely at odds with the lush green countryside which surrounded it. Carl slammed his foot on the brake, quickly turned the van around and drove back towards the large building. It was a crucial find. They guessed that pretty much everything they needed would be inside. More importantly, filling the van with supplies there meant that they didn\u0027t need to get any closer to the centre of the village. More to the point, it meant that they could keep their distance from the sick and diseased remains of the local population.\n \u0027Brilliant,\u0027 Carl said under his breath as he pulled into the car park and slowed the van down. \u0027This is fucking brilliant.\u0027\n He gently turned the steering wheel and guided their vehicle round in a wide and careful arc. Other than four stationary cars (two empty, one containing three motionless bodies and the other a charred wreck) and a single body which tripped and stumbled towards them they seemed to be alone.\n \u0027You want to get as close as you can to the main doors,\u0027 Michael advised from his position behind Carl. \u0027We want to be out in the open as little as possible.\u0027\n Carl\u0027s immediate response was to do and say nothing. After thinking for a couple of seconds he put the van into first gear and pulled away again. He turned away from the building and then stopped when the glass entrance doors were directly behind him.\n \u0027What\u0027s he doing?\u0027 Emma asked quietly.\n \u0027I think he\u0027s going to reverse back,\u0027 Michael replied, his voice equally low. \u0027It\u0027s what I\u0027d do. If I was driving I\u0027d try and get us almost touching the doors so that...\u0027\n He stopped speaking suddenly when Carl jammed the van into reverse gear and slammed his foot down on the accelerator pedal. The force of the sudden and unexpected movement threw Emma and Michael forward in their seats.\n \u0027Jesus Christ!\u0027 Michael screamed over the screeching of tyres tearing across the car park. \u0027What the hell are you doing?\u0027\n The other man didn\u0027t answer. He was looking back over his shoulder, looking past Emma and Michael and towards the supermarket doors. The engine whined as the van hurtled back towards the silent building.\n \u0027Carl!\u0027 Emma protested uselessly. She turned to look behind her and then crouched down with her hands over her head as she braced herself for impact. The van smashed into the plate glass doors and then stopped suddenly - the ear splitting noise of the engine immediately replaced by the deafening crash of shattering glass and the ominous groan of metal on metal. Carl pressed hard on the brake and Michael looked out of the window to his side. The van had stopped a third inside the building and two thirds out in the car park. They were virtually wedged in the doorway.\n \u0027You stupid fucking idiot!\u0027 Emma screamed.\n Ignoring her, Carl turned off the engine, opened the tailgate using a control lever by his right foot, took the keys from the ignition and then clambered out over the back seats. He stepped out into the supermarket, his boots crunching and grinding jagged shards of glass into the marble floor.\n \u0027Good move,\u0027 Michael mumbled under his breath as he watched Carl. He quietly acknowledged that the other man\u0027s unorthodox parking, whilst battering the exterior of their van, had made their situation infinitely easier. Not only had he got them safely inside the building, he\u0027d also managed to block the entrance at the same time, and the entrance would stay blocked until they decided to leave. He was impressed, but he didn\u0027t want Carl to know that he approved. Michael felt sure that he was having real difficulty in coming to terms with recent events and he thought it was important to keep his feet firmly planted on the ground. If he boosted his confidence by applauding his risky and very direct actions what would he do next?\n Michael followed Carl out into the supermarket and Emma followed a few seconds later.\n \u0027Bloody hell,\u0027 she scowled, screwing up her face in disgust.\n \u0027Stinks, doesn\u0027t it?\u0027 Carl said, turning back to look at the others.\n Michael covered his nose and took a few cautious steps further forward. The air was heavy with the sickening stench of rotting food and rotting flesh. More than just unpleasant, the obnoxious smell was stifling and suffocating. It hung heavy in the air and he could feel it coating his throat and dirtying his clothes and hair. It was making Emma retch and heave. She had to fight to control the rising bile in her stomach.\n \u0027We should get a move on,\u0027 Michael suggested. \u0027We don\u0027t want to be here any longer than we need to be.\u0027\n \u0027I agree,\u0027 Emma said. \u0027I can\u0027t stand much of this...\u0027\n Her words were viciously truncated as she was knocked off balance by a lurching, staggering figure which appeared from out of nowhere. The stumbling creature had silently dragged itself along an aisle of rapidly decomposing food. Emma screamed and instinctively pushed the corpse away and down to the ground. Michael stood and watched as the remains of a gaunt, mousy-haired shop-assistant lay still for a second before its withered arms and legs began to flail around again as it desperately tried to haul itself back up onto its unsteady feet. Before it could get up he kicked it in the face and it dropped back down again.\n \u0027We should have a look around,\u0027 he said, anxiously looking from side to side. \u0027There\u0027s bound to be more of them in here.\u0027\n He was right. The deafening crash of the van as it ploughed through the glass doors had attracted the unwelcome attentions of a further five ragged cadavers which had been trapped inside the building. The clumsy remains of four shop staff and one delivery driver slowly advanced towards the three survivors. The battered body on the floor reached out a bony hand and grabbed hold of Michael\u0027s leg. He shook it free and kicked the creature in the head again.\n \u0027Fuck this,\u0027 he spat. \u0027We\u0027ve got to shift them.\u0027\n He looked around again and spied a set of double doors behind a bakery display piled high with stale, mouldy bread. Without saying anything else he took hold of the body at his feet by its shoulders and dragged it across the floor. He kicked open the doors and threw the remains of the man into a room filled with cold, lifeless ovens. Making his way back towards Emma and Carl, he caught hold of the next closest corpse (a check-out operator) and disposed of it in exactly the same way.\n \u0027Carl,\u0027 he yelled as he made his way towards the third creature. \u0027Grab hold of another one, will you? If you\u0027re quick they don\u0027t have time to react.\u0027\n Carl took a deep breath and grabbed hold of the nearest corpse in a tight headlock. With its thrashing limbs carving desperate, uncoordinated arcs through the stagnant air he hauled it over to the bakery and pushed it through the double doors. It collided with the body of the dead check-out operator which, a fraction of a second earlier, had managed to lift itself back up onto its feet.\n Sensing that quick action was needed, Emma ran over towards the others and shoved through the doors the remains of an elderly cleaner who, unbeknownst to Carl, had been staggering dangerously near. She dropped her shoulder and charged at the pitiful figure. The unexpected force of the impact sent the shuffling carcass (which had all the weight and resistance of a limp rag-doll) flying into the bakery.\n In less than three minutes the survivors had cleared the main area of corpses. Once the last one had been safely pushed through the double-doors Michael wheeled a line of twenty or so shopping trolleys in front to prevent them from pushing their way out.\n \u0027Let\u0027s get a move on,\u0027 he said breathlessly as he wiped his dirty hands on the back of his jeans. He stood up straight and rested his hands on his hips. \u0027Just get whatever you can. Load it into boxes and pile it up by the van.\u0027\n In silence they began to work.\n As Michael packed tins of beans, soup and spaghetti into cardboard boxes he nervously looked around. The cold, emotionless faces of the bodies in the bakery stared back at him through small square safety-glass windows in the doors. They were still moving continually. They were clamouring to get out but didn\u0027t have the strength to force themselves free. Were they watching him? Had they not acted quickly in locking the bastard things away, would they have attacked them in the same way that the lone body in the field had attacked him earlier?\n \u0027Jesus Christ,\u0027 Carl said suddenly.\n He was standing at the opposite end of the building to Michael and Emma, close to where the van had smashed through the entrance doors. His voice echoed eerily around the vast and cavernous room.\n \u0027What is it?\u0027 Emma asked, immediately concerned.\n \u0027You don\u0027t want to know what\u0027s going on outside,\u0027 he replied ominously.\n Emma and Michael looked at each other for a fraction of a second before dropping what they were doing and running over to where Carl was standing.\n \u0027Shit,\u0027 Michael hissed as he approached. Even from a distance he could see what had happened.\n Carl had been about to start loading the boxes into the back of the van when he\u0027d noticed a vast crowd of diseased and rotting bodies outside. Their cold, dead faces were pressed hard against the windscreen and every other exposed area of glass. More of the creatures tried unsuccessfully to force their way through the slight gap between the sides of the van and the buckled remains of the supermarket doors.\n Emma stared through the van at the mass of grotesque faces which stared back at her with dark, vacant eyes.\n \u0027How did they...?\u0027 she began. \u0027Why are there so many of them...?\u0027\n \u0027Heard us breaking in, didn\u0027t they,\u0027 Michael whispered. \u0027It\u0027s silent out there. They\u0027d have heard the van and the crash for miles around.\u0027\n Gingerly Carl leant inside the van and looked around.\n \u0027There are loads of the fucking things here,\u0027 he hissed, his voice just loud enough for the others to hear. \u0027There\u0027s got to be thirty or forty of them at least.\u0027\n \u0027Shit,\u0027 Michael cursed.\n \u0027What?\u0027 Emma asked.\n \u0027This is just the start of it,\u0027 he replied. \u0027Fucking hell, that was a hell of a noise we made getting in here. The whole building\u0027s probably been surrounded by now.\u0027\n For a few dangerously long seconds the three survivors stood together in silence. They exchanged awkward, uncertain glances as each one waited for one of the others to make a move.\n \u0027We\u0027ve got to get out of here,\u0027 Carl eventually said, stating the obvious.\n \u0027Have we got everything we need?\u0027 Michael asked.\n \u0027Don\u0027t care,\u0027 the other man snapped. \u0027We\u0027ve just got to go.\u0027\n Michael immediately began to load boxes and bags of food and supplies into the van.\n \u0027You two get inside,\u0027 he said as he worked.\n Carl loaded another two boxes and then clambered back through to the driver\u0027s seat.\n \u0027I\u0027ll get the engine going,\u0027 he shouted.\n \u0027Leave it,\u0027 Emma shouted back. \u0027For God\u0027s sake, leave it to the last possible second will you. The more noise we make the more of those bloody things we\u0027ll have to get through.\u0027\n He didn\u0027t say anything as he climbed through the gap between the front seats and slid down into position. On Michael\u0027s instruction Emma followed and lowered herself into the passenger seat, equally silent. The two of them stared in abject horror at the wall of dead faces gazing back at them. Trying hard to concentrate, Carl attempted to put the key into the ignition. He was shaking with fear. The more he tried to ignore the bodies and keep his hands steady, the more they shook.\n \u0027Last couple of boxes,\u0027 Michael yelled as he crammed more and more into the back of the van. He\u0027d left just enough space for him to be able to climb inside and pull the tailgate shut.\n \u0027Forget the rest of it,\u0027 Emma shouted. \u0027Just get yourself inside.\u0027\n Carl managed to force the key into the ignition. He looked up and to his right. One of the closest bodies in the wretched throng lifted a clumsy hand into the air above its head. It slowly drew its weak and diseased fingers together to form an emaciated fist which, without warning, it brought crashing down on the driver\u0027s door window.\n \u0027Michael,\u0027 he shouted, his voice wavering with strained emotion. \u0027Are you in yet?\u0027\n \u0027Almost,\u0027 the other man replied. \u0027Last box.\u0027\n Carl watched as a second body lifted its hand and smashed the side of the van. Then another and another. The reaction spread through the ragged bodies like fire through a tinder-dry forest. Within seconds the inside of the van was ringing with a deafening crescendo of dull thumps and relentless crashes. He turned the key and started the engine.\n \u0027I\u0027m in,\u0027 Michael yelled as he hauled himself into the van. He reached out and grabbed hold of the tailgate which he pulled shut. \u0027Go!\u0027\n Carl pushed down on the accelerator and cautiously lifted his foot off the clutch. For a second there was no response then a slow, jerking movement as the van inched forward, shackled by the twisted metal remains of the supermarket entrance doors. Another lurch forward and they were free from the door but still progress was difficult, the sheer volume of bodies surrounding the front and sides of the vehicle preventing them from moving away at speed. Terrified, Carl pushed harder on the accelerator and lifted his foot completely off the clutch and this time the van moved away freely. The bulk of the bodies were brushed away to the sides but many others were dragged down under the wheels.\n \u0027Bloody hell,\u0027 Michael mumbled, watching events behind them through a small gap between boxes and bags of food.\n \u0027What\u0027s the matter?\u0027 Emma asked.\n \u0027They won\u0027t lie down,\u0027 he said. \u0027The bastards just won\u0027t lie down.\u0027\n He stared in horror and total disbelief as the crowd surged after them. Although their slow stagger was obviously no match for that of the van, the relentlessness and pointless persistence of the rotting gathering caused an icy chill to run the entire length of his spine. There was no point in them following the van, but still they came.\n \u0027Almost there,\u0027 Carl said under his breath as he steered towards the car park exit.\n \u0027Keep going,\u0027 Emma yelled, her voice hoarse with emotion. \u0027For Christ\u0027s sake don\u0027t stop.\u0027\n A single solitary figure stumbled out in front of the van and, rather than waste precious seconds trying to avoid the woman\u0027s body, Carl instead ploughed straight into it. The momentum of the van carried the corpse along for a few meters before it slipped down under the front bumper and was crushed beneath the wheels. As they left the car park and turned onto the road, Michael continued to watch the battered body on the ground. Its legs were smashed and shattered - that much was clear - and yet it still tried to move. The surging crowd tripped and stumbled over it ignorantly but still it continued to move oblivious. Reaching out with twisting, broken fingers, it dragged itself along the ground, inch by inch by inch. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1/page-26.html","bookId":2557,"book":{"id":2557,"title":"Autumn (Autumn #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Autumn (Autumn #1) \n A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, Autumn chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... \n Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, Autumn offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-autumn-1.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:48:44 AM"}}
