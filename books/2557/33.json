{"id":112058,"no":33,"title":"Page 33","content":"The dream terrified Emma. She woke up drenched in an ice-cold sweat and, for a few uncertain moments, was almost too afraid to move. Once she had managed to convince herself that it had only been a dream and that she was safe (or as safe as she could expect to be), she leant over to her right to check that Michael was still lying on the floor beside her. A wave of cool relief washed over her as she reached out her hand and rested it on his shoulder. She held it there for a few seconds until she was completely sure that all was well. The gentle, rhythmic movements of his body as he breathed were remarkably calming and reassuring. In the days, months and years before her world had been turned upside down Emma had often tried to analyse the hidden meaning of dreams. She had read numerous books that offered explanations for the metaphors and images which filled her mind while she slept. Her dreams had changed since they\u0027d arrived at Penn Farm. There was nothing subtle or hidden in the visions she\u0027d seen in her sleep this morning. They showed her, in no uncertain terms, a terrifying version of the future. A version of the future which could so quickly and easily come to be. Climbing out of bed (and taking care not to disturb Michael as she did so) Emma made her way over to the window and threw back the curtains. She kept her eyes screwed tightly shut for a few seconds - partly because of the bright light flooding in through the glass but mostly because she was afraid of what she might see outside. She breathed a heavy sigh of relief when she finally dared to open her eyes and saw that only thirty or forty figures remained on the other side of the barrier. The majority of the crowd that had gathered last night had wandered away into the wilderness again, perhaps having been distracted by some other sound or movement. Since they had switched off the generator the farmhouse had, to all intents and purposes, appeared to be as dead and as empty as any one of the hundreds of thousands of other buildings dotted around the countryside. Emma heard noises downstairs. It was almost eight o\u0027clock and the fact that it was now a reasonable hour to be getting up coupled with the fact that she knew the barrier round the building was still intact, gave her a comforting feeling of security and protection. Feeling certain that all was well within the house, and still taking care not to disturb Michael, she pulled on some clothes and made her way downstairs. She found Carl in the kitchen. \u0027Morning,\u0027 she said as she walked into the room. She yawned and stretched. Other than mumbling something indistinct Carl didn\u0027t stop or look up from what he was doing. Emma stood and watched him for a moment. He was fully dressed and had obviously washed and shaved. He was searching through the kitchen cupboards and had collected a pile of food and supplies on the table. \u0027What are you doing?\u0027 she asked cautiously. \u0027Nothing,\u0027 he muttered, still not looking up at her. \u0027Doesn\u0027t look like nothing to me.\u0027 Carl didn\u0027t reply. Sensing his very obvious reluctance to talk, Emma walked round him and made her way over to the cooker. She lifted the kettle and shook it. Happy that there was enough water inside she put it down again and lit the gas burner. The kettle and stove were cold and unused. Whatever it was Carl was doing was obviously important because he hadn\u0027t bothered to make himself a drink since getting up. One thing that the three survivors had quickly found they had in common was a need to get a hot drink inside them before they could function in the morning. \u0027Want a coffee?\u0027 she asked amiably, determined not to let his hostility deter her. \u0027No,\u0027 he replied abruptly, still avoiding eye-contact. \u0027No thanks.\u0027 Emma shrugged her shoulders and spooned coffee granules into two mugs. There was an oppressive atmosphere in the room. The only noise came from the kettle boiling on the stove. Carl continued to look through the cupboards and drawers. Emma felt uneasy. He was obviously up to something but he clearly didn\u0027t want to talk and she couldn\u0027t think of a subtle way of asking him what it was that he was doing. She quickly came to the conclusion that she should just ask outright again, and that she should keep asking until she got the answers she wanted. \u0027Carl,\u0027 she began, \u0027what exactly are you doing? And please don\u0027t insult my intelligence by telling me it\u0027s nothing when it\u0027s bloody obvious that it\u0027s not.\u0027 He continued to ignore her. Emma noticed that there was a well-packed rucksack resting against a wall in the store room adjacent to the kitchen. \u0027Where are you thinking of going?\u0027 she asked. Still no response. The kettle began to boil. Emma made a cup of coffee for herself and one for Michael. She sipped at her scalding hot drink and looked directly at Carl over the brim of her mug. \u0027Where are you going to go?\u0027 she asked again, her voice deliberately low and calm. Carl turned his back to her and leant against the nearest kitchen unit. \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 he eventually replied. Emma guessed that he was lying. It was obvious that although he feigned nonchalance, he knew exactly where he was going and what he was planning to do. \u0027Come on,\u0027 she sighed, growing tired. \u0027Do you really expect me to believe that?\u0027 \u0027Believe what you want,\u0027 he snapped. \u0027Doesn\u0027t matter to me.\u0027 \u0027You can\u0027t leave the house, it\u0027s too dangerous. Bloody hell, you saw how many of those things managed to get here last night. If you really think that you...\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s the whole fucking problem, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 he said, finally turning round to face her. \u0027I saw how many bodies were here last night - too bloody many. It\u0027s not safe to stay here anymore.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s not safe anywhere these days. Face it, Carl, this place is as good as you\u0027re going to get.\u0027 \u0027No it isn\u0027t,\u0027 he argued. \u0027We\u0027re out on a limb here. There\u0027s nowhere to run. If that fence comes down we\u0027re completely fucked...\u0027 \u0027But can\u0027t you see that we can get over that? When they\u0027re here in large numbers we just shut up and sit tight. If we stay silent and out of sight for long enough they\u0027ll disappear.\u0027 \u0027And is that what you want? Are you happy to sit and hide for hours every time those bloody things get close? They\u0027re getting stronger everyday and it won\u0027t be long before...\u0027 \u0027Of course it\u0027s not ideal, but what\u0027s the alternative?\u0027 \u0027The alternative is to go back home. I know Northwich like the back of my hand and I know that there are other survivors there. I think I\u0027ll have more of a chance back in the city. It was a mistake coming out here.\u0027 Emma struggled to comprehend what she was hearing. \u0027Are you fucking crazy?\u0027 she stammered. \u0027Do you know the risks you\u0027d be taking by...\u0027 \u0027Emma, I\u0027m going. If you haven\u0027t got anything constructive to say then do me a favour and don\u0027t say anything at all.\u0027 \u0027But have you thought this through? Do you really believe this is the right thing to do?\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s safety in numbers,\u0027 he said, turning his back on her again. \u0027Those bloody things proved it last night, didn\u0027t they? More survivors has got to equal more of a chance in my book...\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re wrong,\u0027 Michael interrupted. He was standing in the kitchen doorway. Neither Emma or Carl knew how long he\u0027d been there or how much he\u0027d heard. He leant against the door frame with his arms crossed in front of him. Carl shook his head. \u0027Leaving here would be a fucking stupid thing to do,\u0027 Michael added. \u0027Staying here seems like a fucking stupid thing to do too,\u0027 he snapped back. Michael took a deep breath and walked further into the kitchen. He sat on the edge of the kitchen table and watched the other man as he tried desperately to busy himself and avoid eye contact with the other two survivors. \u0027Convince me,\u0027 Michael said as he took his coffee from Emma. \u0027Just how much have you thought about this?\u0027 For a second Carl was angry, feeling that Michael was patronising him. But then he decided that he sounded as if he was at least going to listen to what he had to say. \u0027I\u0027ve thought long and hard about it,\u0027 he replied, \u0027this isn\u0027t something that I\u0027ve just decided to do on a whim.\u0027 \u0027So what\u0027s your plan?\u0027 \u0027Get back to Northwich and try and get to the community centre. See who\u0027s still there...\u0027 \u0027And then?\u0027 \u0027And then find somewhere secure to base myself.\u0027 \u0027But you said you didn\u0027t want to lock yourself away and hide. Aren\u0027t you just going to be doing that somewhere else instead of here?\u0027 Emma asked. \u0027There\u0027s a council works depot between the community centre and where I used to live. There\u0027s a bloody ten foot wall right the way around it. Once we\u0027re in there we\u0027re safe. There\u0027s trucks and all kinds of things there.\u0027 \u0027How you going to get in?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll get in.\u0027 \u0027And what if there\u0027s no-one at the Community Centre?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll keep going to the depot on my own.\u0027 Michael stopped asking questions and sat and thought for a few seconds. \u0027So when were you thinking of going?\u0027 he wondered. \u0027We\u0027ve got to go out for supplies at some point in the next few days,\u0027 Carl answered. \u0027I figured I\u0027d try and get some transport while we were away from the house and then I\u0027ll take it from there.\u0027 \u0027We could go and get supplies today,\u0027 Michael said, surprising Emma who looked at him with an expression of utter disbelief on her face. \u0027What the hell are you doing?\u0027 she hissed at him. \u0027Christ, are you thinking of going too?\u0027 Michael shook his head. \u0027Seems to me that you\u0027re going to go whatever we try and say or do to stop you.\u0027 Carl nodded. \u0027I\u0027d go now if I could.\u0027 \u0027Then there doesn\u0027t seem to be any point in Emma or I wasting our time trying to convince you that you\u0027re making a mistake.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t think I am. You are right though, you\u0027d be wasting your time.\u0027 \u0027And if we try and stop you leaving we\u0027ll probably end up beating the crap out of each other and the net result will still be that you leave. Am I right?\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re right.\u0027 He turned to face Emma. \u0027So we don\u0027t have a lot of choice, do we?\u0027 \u0027But, Mike, he\u0027ll end up dead. He won\u0027t last five minutes out there.\u0027 Michael sighed and watched Carl disappear into the store room. \u0027That\u0027s not our problem,\u0027 he said. \u0027Our priority is to keep ourselves safe, and if that means that Carl leaves then Carl leaves. Think of him as a homing pigeon. We send him on his way today and, with a little luck, if things don\u0027t work out he\u0027ll bring the rest of the survivors from Northwich back here with him if he manages to find them.\u0027 Emma nodded. She understood everything he said but still found it hard to accept. \u0027He\u0027s a stupid fucking idiot,\u0027 she hissed under her breath.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1/page-33.html","bookId":2557,"book":{"id":2557,"title":"Autumn (Autumn #1)","description":"Storyline: Autumn (Autumn #1) A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, Autumn chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, Autumn offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-autumn-1.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:48:44 AM"}}
