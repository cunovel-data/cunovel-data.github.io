{"id":112037,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"The isolation and desperation of the situation affected all of the survivors, some much more than others. Carl spent most of the afternoon trying (unsuccessfully) to catch up on missed sleep and (also unsuccessfully) to forget everything that was happening outside. Time was dragging at an unbearable and painfully slow rate. An hour now felt like five and five hours more like fifty. As the sun began to sink back below the horizon he clambered out of the community hall once more and stood alone on the small area of flat roof he\u0027d discovered the previous evening.\\n\\n For a moment the air was pure and refreshing and he swallowed several deep, calming breaths before the now familiar smells of death and of burning buildings quickly returned, blown towards him on a cool and gusting wind. There was a sudden unexpected noise behind him and he span around to see Michael struggling to climb through the tiny skylight.\\n\\n \u0027Did I make you jump?\u0027 he asked as he dragged himself out onto the roof. \u0027Sorry, mate, I didn\u0027t mean to. I was looking for you and I saw you disappear up here and...\u0027\\n\\n Carl shook his head and looked away, disappointed that his little sanctuary had been discovered. In the community centre private space was at a premium and they had all been limited to just a few square feet each. Almost every move that every person made indoors could be seen by everyone else. Carl hated it and he\u0027d been looking forward to getting out onto the roof and spending some time alone. The small square roof had been the only place so far where he\u0027d been able to stretch, scratch, stamp, scream, punch and cry without feeling that he had to hold back on how he truly felt because of the effect it might have on the others. Stupid that almost everyone else was dead and yet he still instinctively found himself considering what the few remaining people might think of him rather than just being honest and true to himself. The effects of years and years of conditioning by society were going to take more than a few days to fade away.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re okay,\u0027 he sighed as the other man approached. \u0027I just came out here to get away for a while.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you want me to go back inside?\u0027 Michael asked anxiously, sensing that he was in the way. \u0027If you want me to go then I\u0027ll...\u0027\\n\\n Carl slowly shook his head again.\\n\\n \u0027No, it\u0027s okay.\u0027\\n\\n Glad to hear that he wasn\u0027t intruding (although not entirely convinced that he really was welcome) Michael walked across to stand next to Carl at the edge of the roof.\\n\\n \u0027What the bloody hell is happening?\u0027 he asked, his voice so low that Carl could hardly hear what he\u0027d said.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 he mumbled in reply, equally quietly.\\n\\n \u0027Christ, it\u0027s just the speed of it all,\u0027 Michael mumbled. \u0027A few days ago everything was normal, but now...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know,\u0027 Carl sighed. \u0027I know.\u0027\\n\\n The two men stood in silence for a while and surveyed the devastation around them. No matter how long and how hard either of them stared for, they still couldn\u0027t accept the sight of countless bodies lying face down on the cold ground. Even more difficult to accept were those pitiful corpses that were now moving. How could any of this nightmare be happening?\\n\\n \u0027Almost makes you envy them, doesn\u0027t it?\u0027 Carl muttered.\\n\\n \u0027Who?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The bodies still lying on the ground. The ones that haven\u0027t moved. I can\u0027t help thinking how much easier it would have been to be...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s a fucking stupid way to talk, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 Michael spat.\\n\\n \u0027Is it?\u0027 he snapped back angrily.\\n\\n In the heavy silence that followed Carl thought about his words. Bloody hell, how low and defeatist he suddenly sounded. But why not, he thought? Why shouldn\u0027t he be? His life had been turned upside down and inside out and he\u0027d lost everything. Not just his possessions and his property, he\u0027d lost absolutely everything. And when he thought about poor Sarah and Gemma, lying there together in their bed at home, the pain he felt became immeasurably worse. But were they still there? Had they been affected by this new change? The thought of his beautiful little girl walking aimlessly through the dark streets alone was too much to bear. He tried unsuccessfully to hide the tears which streamed freely down his tired face.\\n\\n \u0027Come on,\u0027 Michael whispered, attempting to reassure him (although he already knew that there was no way he could).\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m okay,\u0027 Carl sniffed. It was patently obvious that he was not.\\n\\n \u0027Sure?\u0027 the other man pressed.\\n\\n Carl looked into his face and forced himself to smile for a fraction of a second. He was about to reply with the standard \u0027yes, I\u0027m all right,\u0027 when he stopped. There was no point in hiding the truth anymore.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 he admitted. \u0027No, mate, I\u0027m not all right...\u0027\\n\\n Suddenly unable to say another word, he found himself sobbing helplessly.\\n\\n \u0027Me neither,\u0027 Michael admitted, wiping tears of desperation and pain from his own eyes.\\n\\n The two men sat down on the edge of the roof, their feet dangling freely over the side of the building. Michael stretched, yawned, and then ran his fingers through his matted hair. He felt dirty. He\u0027d have paid any price to have been able to relax in a hot bath or shower and follow it up with a night spent in a comfortable bed. Or even an uncomfortable bed. Just something better than a hard wooden bench in a cold wooden building.\\n\\n \u0027You know what we need?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n \u0027I can think of about a million things that I need,\u0027 Carl answered.\\n\\n \u0027Forget about all the practical stuff for a minute, and all the things that we should have like warmth, safety, security, answers to a million questions and the like, do you know what I need more than anything?\u0027\\n\\n Carl shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n \u0027No, what?\u0027\\n\\n Michael paused, lay back on the asphalt and put his hands behind his head.\\n\\n \u0027I need to get absolutely fucking plastered. I need to drink so much fucking beer that I can\u0027t remember my own name, never mind anything else.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s an off-licence over there,\u0027 Carl said, half-smiling and pointing across the main road. \u0027Fancy a walk?\u0027\\n\\n He glanced down at Michael who was shaking his head furiously.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 he replied abruptly.\\n\\n Another long silence followed.\\n\\n \u0027Christ, look at him would you,\u0027 Carl said, minutes later. Michael sat up.\\n\\n \u0027Who?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n \u0027That one over there,\u0027 he said, nodding at a solitary figure in the distance which tripped and stumbled along the edge of the main road. The shadowy shell had once been a man, perhaps six foot tall and probably aged between twenty-five and thirty. It was walking awkwardly with one foot on the kerb and the other dragging behind in the gutter.\\n\\n \u0027What about him?\u0027\\n\\n Carl shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 he sighed. \u0027Just look at the state of him. That could be you or me, that could.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes but it isn\u0027t,\u0027 Michael yawned, about to lie back down again.\\n\\n \u0027And there\u0027s another. See that one in the newsagents?\u0027\\n\\n Michael squinted into the distance.\\n\\n \u0027Where?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The newsagents with the red sign. Between the pub and the garage...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh yeah, I can see it.\u0027\\n\\n The two men stared at the body in the building. It was trapped in the entrance to the shop. A display rack had fallen behind it, blocking any movement backwards, and a crashed car prevented the door from opening outwards. The body moved incessantly, edging forward and then stumbling back, edging forward and then back.\\n\\n \u0027It just hasn\u0027t got a clue what\u0027s happening, has it?\u0027 Carl muttered. \u0027You\u0027d think it would give up, wouldn\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s just moving for the sake of it. It doesn\u0027t know how or why or what to do. It just needs to move.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And how long will they keep moving? Bloody hell, when will they stop?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They won\u0027t. There isn\u0027t any reason to stop is there? Nothing registers with them anymore. Look, watch this.\u0027\\n\\n Michael stood up and looked around. He walked over to where the slanted roof of the main part of the building met the flat roof they were standing on and pulled away a single slate. Carl watched bemused as he walked back to the edge of the roof.\\n\\n \u0027What the bloody hell are you doing?\u0027 he smirked.\\n\\n \u0027Watch,\u0027 Michael said quietly.\\n\\n He waited for a few seconds until one of the wandering bodies came into range. Then, after taking careful aim, he threw the tile at the staggering corpse. He was surprisingly accurate and the tile hit the body in the small of the back. The body tripped and stumbled momentarily but carried on regardless.\\n\\n \u0027Why did you do that?\u0027 Carl asked, still bemused.\\n\\n Michael shrugged.\\n\\n \u0027Just proving a point I suppose.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What point?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That they don\u0027t react. That they don\u0027t live like you and me, they just exist.\u0027\\n\\n Carl shook his head with despair and disbelief. Michael walked away again. In a strange way he regretted throwing the slate at the body. No matter what it was today, it had been a living, breathing human being just a few days ago. He felt like a mugger, preying on an innocent victim.\\n\\n \u0027Do you think it was a virus that did this?\u0027 Carl asked. \u0027Emma seems to think it was. Or do you think it was...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t know and I don\u0027t care,\u0027 Michael replied.\\n\\n \u0027What do you mean, you don\u0027t care?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What difference does it make? What\u0027s happened has happened. It\u0027s the old clich��, isn\u0027t it? If you get knocked down by a car, does it matter what colour it is?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So what are you saying?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m saying that it doesn\u0027t matter what did all of this. Okay, it matters in as far as I don\u0027t want it to happen to me, but what\u0027s done is done, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Suppose so.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Look, I\u0027ve lost friends and family just like the rest of them. I might sound like an uncaring bastard but I\u0027m not really. I just can\u0027t see the point in wasting any time coming up with bullshit theories and explanations when none of it will make the slightest bit of difference. The only thing that any of us have any influence and control over now is what we do tomorrow.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So what are we going to do tomorrow?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Haven\u0027t got a fucking clue!\u0027 Michael laughed.\\n\\n It started to rain. A few isolated spots at first which, in just a few seconds, turned into a downpour of almost monsoon proportions. Carl and Michael quickly squeezed back through the skylight and lowered themselves into the ominously silent hall.\\n\\n \u0027Does you good to get out now and then, doesn\u0027t it?\u0027 Carl mumbled sarcastically.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s a lot of truth in that,\u0027 Michael replied, fighting to make himself heard over the noise of the rain lashing down.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re right. I think it would do us good to get out. Have you stopped to think about the bodies yet?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Christ I haven\u0027t thought about much else...\u0027\\n\\n Michael shook his head.\\n\\n \u0027No, have you stopped to think about what\u0027s going to happen when they start to rot? Jesus, the air\u0027s going to be filled with all kinds of germs and crap.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s not a lot we can do about that, is there?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s fuck all we can do about it,\u0027 he replied bluntly. \u0027But we could get away.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Get away? Where to? It\u0027s going to be like this everywhere, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So what good will leaving here do?\u0027\\n\\n It became immediately apparent to Carl that Michael had been doing more logical thinking than the rest of the survivors put together.\\n\\n \u0027Think about it. We\u0027re on the edge of a city here. There are hundreds of thousands of bodies around.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And I think we should head for the countryside. Fewer bodies has got to mean less chance of disease. We\u0027re not going to be completely safe anywhere but I think we should just try and give ourselves the best possible chance. We should pack up and leave here as soon as we can.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You really thinking of going?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027d go tonight if we were ready.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1/page-11.html","bookId":2557,"book":{"id":2557,"title":"Autumn (Autumn #1)","description":"Storyline: Autumn (Autumn #1) \\n A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, Autumn chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... \\n Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, Autumn offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-autumn-1.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:48:44 AM"}}
