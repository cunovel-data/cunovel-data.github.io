{"id":112065,"no":41,"title":"Page 41","content":"Michael came in from outside. \u0027We\u0027ve got a problem,\u0027 he said, his face flustered. Immediately concerned, Emma stopped what she had been doing and rushed out to him in the hall. \u0027What is it?\u0027 \u0027The van,\u0027 he replied. \u0027It\u0027s completely fucked. There\u0027s oil and all kinds of stuff leaking out. Looks like something\u0027s cracked underneath.\u0027 \u0027So can you fix it?\u0027 she asked. A sensible question. Michael shook his head despondently. \u0027I haven\u0027t got a bloody clue,\u0027 he admitted. \u0027I can drive a car, fill it with petrol and change a tyre but that\u0027s about all. I wouldn\u0027t know where to start with something like this.\u0027 \u0027So what do we do? Can we get by without it?\u0027 \u0027We can, but we\u0027d be taking a hell of a chance. What if the same thing happens to the Landrover?\u0027 \u0027So what do we do?\u0027 she asked again. \u0027We go out and get ourselves another van,\u0027 he replied. And so, less than an hour later, Michael and Emma again found themselves leaving the relative safety of Penn Farm and heading back towards one of the dead villages dotted around the decaying countryside. For once Michael\u0027s usually keen sense of direction let him down. Distracted by a body lurching out at them from out of nowhere at a cross-roads, he took a wrong turn which soon led them out along a long, straight stretch of narrow road. The road climbed for more than a mile before becoming flatter and more level. At the top of the climb the trees and bushes which had surrounded them before and obscured their view disappeared. Everywhere suddenly felt empty, spacious and open. Intrigued, Michael drove through an open gate and into a wide field dotted with a handful of cars. They had arrived in a dusty, cliff-top car park where, from the far side of the field, they could see out over the ocean. Neither of them had thought that they were this close to the coast. In the confusion and disorientation of the last few weeks their whole world felt like it had been pulled and twisted out of shape beyond all recognition. Maps and atlases had been forgotten and put to one side as they had struggled to survive from day to day. Strange as it seemed, the ocean had been the last thing that Michael had expected to see. A little more relaxed than they had been before (perhaps because for once they couldn\u0027t see a single body nearby) they drove to the area of the car park which afforded them the best view of the seemingly endless expanse of water below them and stopped. Michael switched off the engine and slumped back in his chair. \u0027Screwed that up, didn\u0027t I?\u0027 he smiled. \u0027Doesn\u0027t matter,\u0027 Emma mumbled as she wound down her window slightly. The noise of the wind and the sea was loud and welcome. As well as shattering the otherwise all-consuming silence of the world for a while, it also camouflaged any sound which the two of them might make. The sight of the ocean filled Michael with an unexpected combination of emotions. He had always loved the sea as a child, and seeing it now made him remember a handful of memories of childhood holidays, when the sky had always been deep blue, the sun huge and hot and the days seemingly endless. The memory of those long-gone innocent days filled him with a now familiar sadness and grief. But those heavy, desperate feelings were also matched by a slight elation because, for once, the two of them were free from the confines of the farmhouse and the barrier and, for a short time at least, away from the millions of bodies which plagued their lives. \u0027Safest thing to do would be to take one of these cars,\u0027 he said, gesturing out across the car park. \u0027We\u0027ll find the one that\u0027s in best condition, empty it, and then drive it back.\u0027 Emma nodded and continued to look out over the sea. \u0027Think it\u0027s safe to get out?\u0027 she asked. \u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 he replied. \u0027There\u0027s nothing about. As long as we stay close we should be okay.\u0027 Needing no further encouragement, Emma opened the door and stepped outside. The blustery wind was strong and refreshing and it carried with it the unmistakable smell of the salty water below. She looked out towards the horizon and just dared to imagine for a few seconds that nothing had happened. She had tried to do it many times before but there had always been something in her line of vision to remind her of the limitations of the shattered shell of a world in which she existed. Looking out over the uninterrupted water, however, for a short time at least it was relatively easy to pretend everything was okay. She took a few steps further forward and looked down onto a stretch of sandy beach. Her heart sank as she watched a single staggering body tripping and stumbling through the frothing, splashing surf. Each advancing wave knocked the pathetic creature off-balance. She watched as it struggled to stand, only to be knocked over again when the next wave came. There was a second body in the water wearing only a pair of swimming trunks. Obviously the unfortunate remains of an early morning bather from a couple of weeks ago, the bloated, swollen and discoloured body was gradually being washed ashore. Michael hadn\u0027t seen the bodies. He was still daydreaming as he sat down on the grass next to their vehicle. \u0027You know,\u0027 he began, \u0027sitting here you could almost convince yourself that nothing had happened.\u0027 Emma said nothing. Having had the same thought just a few seconds earlier, the appearance of the bodies in the surf below had depressed her. She didn\u0027t think it was fair to spoil her friend\u0027s enjoyment of the moment. Michael stretched out on the grass, lying back and resting on his elbows. He looked over at Emma and smiled. \u0027Know what I want?\u0027 he asked. \u0027What?\u0027 she wondered, feigning interest. \u0027A sandwich,\u0027 he replied. \u0027I want a big, thick sandwich on freshly baked, crusty bread. I want salad, sliced ham, grated cheese and mayonnaise. Oh, and I\u0027ll have a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice to wash it down with.\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ve got tinned ham and a little bit of mayo back at the farm,\u0027 Emma said, sitting down next to him. \u0027And we\u0027ve got orange cordial.\u0027 \u0027Not the same really, is it?\u0027 She shook her head. \u0027No. Think we\u0027ll ever eat like that again?\u0027 Michael thought for a few moments. \u0027We might do. I bet we could make bread and cheese eventually, and we could have ham if we can catch and kill a pig. And I suppose we could grow fruit and vegetables if we set up a greenhouse...\u0027 \u0027You should get yourself an allotment,\u0027 she joked. \u0027I could do,\u0027 Michael said, semiseriously. He sighed sadly and looked up into the sky. \u0027I don\u0027t know, it\u0027s fucking stupid, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 \u0027What is?\u0027 \u0027Everything we\u0027ve just said. In a few seconds we\u0027ve managed to come up with about six month\u0027s work. Six months to get a fucking salad sandwich and a glass of orange juice...\u0027 \u0027I know,\u0027 she sympathised. Michael yawned and stretched. He looked across at Emma who suddenly seemed to be deep in thought. He had learnt recently that this was not always a good sign. It was okay to think for a while, but concentrating too deeply on everything that had happened often caused real problems. \u0027Are you okay?\u0027 he asked. She smiled and nodded and looked down at him. \u0027I\u0027m okay,\u0027 she replied, giving little away. \u0027But...?\u0027 he pressed, sensing that she needed to talk. He stared at her and, once eye-contact had been made, she realised that she couldn\u0027t avoid answering him. \u0027Are we really doing the right thing here?\u0027 she asked. \u0027What, sitting in a car park looking at the sea?\u0027 he replied flippantly. Unamused, Emma shook her head. \u0027No, I\u0027m talking about the house and being out in the countryside.\u0027 Michael sat up attentively, sensing the seriousness in her voice. \u0027Of course we are,\u0027 he answered defensively. \u0027Why, are you starting to have doubts?\u0027 \u0027What is there to have doubts about?\u0027 \u0027Whether we should ever have left the city? Whether Carl was the one who was right to go back there?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not having doubts...\u0027 \u0027So what is it then? Don\u0027t you think we can make anything of what\u0027s left?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not sure. Do you?\u0027 \u0027We might be able to. The bodies are rotting, aren\u0027t they? They should disappear over time and if we could...\u0027 \u0027What about disease?\u0027 \u0027There are a thousand hospitals up and down the country full of drugs.\u0027 \u0027But we don\u0027t know which drugs to use.\u0027 \u0027We can find out.\u0027 \u0027But if we\u0027re sick and we need to get drugs, we\u0027ll need to know what disease we\u0027ve got, won\u0027t we? How do we diagnose that? Do you know the difference between malaria, typhoid and gout for God\u0027s sake?\u0027 \u0027No, but there are books...\u0027 \u0027So what chance have we got?\u0027 Michael stood up and walked over to Emma. Although she still tried to avoid eye contact, he positioned himself directly in front of her so that she had no choice but to look up into his face. \u0027We\u0027ve got a chance,\u0027 he said, his voice sounding quiet and strangely hurt. \u0027Okay, I accept that it might not be much of a chance, but to me it\u0027s a fucking chance all the same and I\u0027m going to take it.\u0027 \u0027I know,\u0027 she sighed. \u0027I\u0027m sorry...\u0027 The couple were silent for a few seconds. Both stared into the eyes of the other, their minds full of confused thoughts. \u0027Look, let\u0027s get back,\u0027 Michael said eventually. \u0027It\u0027s not safe to be out here.\u0027 With that he turned away and looked around the car park. About a hundred yards away from them was a car. Nothing special - just an ordinary family-sized saloon - but it was the biggest car in the field. With Emma following close by, he walked over to it and opened the door. The remains of the driver and his female passenger sat motionless in their seats. They were both dressed in business clothes and Michael wondered what they had been doing sitting in this exposed and isolated place so early on a Tuesday morning when the catastrophe had first struck. An illicit office affair perhaps, or a married couple passing the time and spending a few precious minutes together before heading off to work? Regardless of the reason, he carefully leant inside the car and undid both seat belts. Cautiously (and with a look of disgust and concentration on his face) he took hold of the driver and dragged his corpse across the grass, leaving it on the ground alongside another car. He then returned and did the same with the passenger. The least he could do for them, he thought, was leave them together. The keys were still in the ignition. He started the engine and gestured for Emma to get inside. \u0027Follow me back,\u0027 he said, suddenly anxious and feeling uncomfortably vulnerable now that they were making a noise which might alert any nearby bodies to their presence. \u0027Okay?\u0027 She nodded and sat behind the wheel. Michael ran over to the Landrover, started it up and pulled away. In convoy the two cars drove out of the car park and back towards the farm.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1/page-41.html","bookId":2557,"book":{"id":2557,"title":"Autumn (Autumn #1)","description":"Storyline: Autumn (Autumn #1) A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, Autumn chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, Autumn offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-autumn-1.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:48:44 AM"}}
