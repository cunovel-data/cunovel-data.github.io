{"id":112036,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"Almost an hour passed before anyone dared to move.\\n\\n The survivors, already shell-shocked and beaten by all that they had been through, stood together in terror and disbelief and tried to come to terms with the morning\u0027s events. Surprisingly it was Ralph, the solicitor who had seemed so authoritative and keen to take control last night, who appeared to be having the most trouble accepting what he had seen and heard today. He stood in the centre of the room alongside Paul Garner (an overweight and middle-aged estate agent), struggling to persuade Emma, Carl, Michael and Kate James (a thirty-nine year old primary school teacher) not to open the door and go back outside.\\n\\n \u0027But we have to go out, Ralph,\u0027 Emma said, calmly and quietly. \u0027We\u0027ve got to try and find out what\u0027s going on.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not interested,\u0027 the flustered and frightened man snapped. \u0027I don\u0027t care what\u0027s happening. There\u0027s no way I\u0027m going to go out there and risk...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Risk what?\u0027 Michael interrupted. \u0027No-one\u0027s asking you to go outside, are they?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Opening that door is enough of a bloody risk in itself,\u0027 Garner muttered anxiously. He chewed on the fingers of his left hand as he spoke. \u0027Keep it shut and keep them out.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We can\u0027t take any chances by exposing ourselves to those things...\u0027 Ralph protested.\\n\\n \u0027Things?\u0027 Emma repeated, her tone suddenly venomous and agitated. \u0027Those things are people you selfish shit. Bloody hell, your friends and family could be out there...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Those bodies have been lying dead on the ground for days!\u0027 he yelled, his face suddenly just inches from hers.\\n\\n \u0027How do you know they were dead?\u0027 Michael asked, perfectly seriously and calmly. \u0027Did you check them all? Did you check any of them for a pulse before you shut yourself away in here?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You know as well as I do that...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did you?\u0027 he asked again. Ralph shook his head. \u0027And have you ever seen a dead body walk before?\u0027\\n\\n This time Ralph didn\u0027t answer. He turned away and leant against the nearest wall.\\n\\n \u0027Jesus Christ,\u0027 Garner cursed, \u0027of course we\u0027ve never seen fucking dead bodies walking, but...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But I\u0027ve never seen anyone drop to the ground and not get up for two days either. Face it Michael, they were all dead.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Look, Paul,\u0027 he sighed, \u0027let\u0027s be straight with each other for a second. None of us have got the first bloody clue what\u0027s happening here. The only thing I know for sure is that I\u0027m interested in looking after myself and the rest of the people in this hall and...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If you\u0027re only interested in the people in here why do you want to go out there and...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m interested in looking after myself,\u0027 Michael repeated, still somehow remaining calm, \u0027but I need to go out there and see if I can find out what\u0027s happening and to see if any of those bodies pose a threat to us. I\u0027m not interested in helping them, I just want to know what\u0027s going on.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And how are you going to find out what\u0027s happening?\u0027 Ralph demanded, turning around to face the rest of the group again. \u0027Who\u0027s going to tell you?\u0027\\n\\n For a moment Michael struggled to answer.\\n\\n \u0027Emma\u0027s studied medicine,\u0027 he replied, thinking quickly and looking across at her. \u0027You\u0027ll be able to tell us what\u0027s wrong with them, won\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n Emma shifted her weight uncomfortably from foot to foot and shrugged her shoulders.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll try,\u0027 she mumbled. \u0027I can try and tell you whether they\u0027re dead or not but after that I...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But can\u0027t you see what you\u0027re doing?\u0027 Ralph protested, taking off his glasses and rubbing his eyes. \u0027You\u0027re putting us all at risk. If you\u0027d just wait for a while and...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Wait for what?\u0027 Carl interrupted. \u0027Seems to me that we\u0027re at risk whatever we do. We\u0027re sat here in a hall that we could knock down with our bare hands if we tried hard enough, and we\u0027re surrounded by thousands of dead bodies, some of which have decided to get up and start walking around. Staying here seems pretty risky to me.\u0027\\n\\n Sensing that the conversation was about to stray into familiar waters with yet another pointless debate about whether to go outside or not, Michael made his feelings and intentions clear.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m going outside,\u0027 he said. His voice was quiet and yet carried with it an undeniable force. \u0027Stay in here and hide if you want, but I\u0027m going out and I\u0027m going out now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027For Christ\u0027s sake,\u0027 Ralph pleaded, \u0027think about it before you do anything that might...\u0027\\n\\n Michael didn\u0027t stop to hear the end of his sentence. Instead he simply turned his back on the others and walked up to the main door out of the community centre. He paused for a second and glanced back over his shoulder towards Carl, Emma and Kate. The rest of the survivors were silent.\\n\\n \u0027Ready?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n After a second\u0027s thought Carl nodded and made his way to stand next to Michael, closely followed by Emma and Kate. Michael took a deep breath, pushed the door open and stepped out into the bright September sunlight.\\n\\n It was surprisingly warm. Carl (the only one who had been outside for any length of time recently) noticed that last night\u0027s bitter wind had dropped. He shielded his eyes from the light and watched as Michael cautiously retraced the steps that he had taken earlier, walking away from the dilapidated wooden building and towards the road. When the first moving body staggered into view he instinctively stopped and turned back to face the others.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s the matter?\u0027 asked Emma, immediately concerned.\\n\\n \u0027Nothing,\u0027 he mumbled, feeling nervous and unsure.\\n\\n The three other survivors walked towards him and stood close. Carl noticed that a crowd had gathered to watch them in the shadows of the doorway of the community hall.\\n\\n \u0027So what are we going to do now?\u0027 Kate James wondered. She was a quiet, short and round woman with a usually flushed red face which had suddenly lost much of its colour.\\n\\n Michael looked around for inspiration.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 he admitted. \u0027Anyone got any ideas?\u0027\\n\\n Three faces returned three blank expressions. A few seconds later Emma cleared her throat and spoke.\\n\\n \u0027We need to have a good look at one of them,\u0027 she whispered.\\n\\n \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 Kate asked, her voice also quiet. \u0027What are we supposed to be looking at?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s try and see how responsive they are. We should see if they can tell us anything.\u0027\\n\\n While she had been speaking Michael had taken a few steps further forward.\\n\\n \u0027What about her?\u0027 he asked, pointing at one of the nearest moving bodies. \u0027What about that one there?\u0027\\n\\n The group stood together in silence and watched the painful progress of the pitiful creature. The woman\u0027s movements were tired and stilted. Her arms hung listlessly at her sides. She seemed almost to be dragging her feet behind her.\\n\\n \u0027What are we going to do with her?\u0027 Kate wondered nervously.\\n\\n \u0027Do you want to get closer and just have a look?\u0027 Carl asked.\\n\\n Michael shook his head.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 he said, \u0027let\u0027s get her inside.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What, back in there?\u0027 he gasped, gesturing at the building behind them.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, in there,\u0027 Michael replied. His voice still remained calm and unflustered and it was beginning to annoy Carl who silently hoped that the others shared his mounting fear and unease because he certainly wasn\u0027t as together and as sure as Michael appeared. \u0027Is that a problem?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not to me,\u0027 said Emma. \u0027Try convincing the others though.\u0027\\n\\n He obviously wasn\u0027t concerned.\\n\\n \u0027I think we should get her indoors and try and make her comfortable. We\u0027ll get more out of her if we can get her to relax.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are you sure about this?\u0027 muttered Kate. Her nerves were obviously beginning to fray.\\n\\n Michael thought for a moment before nodding his head.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sure,\u0027 he said, sounding confident. \u0027What about the rest of you?\u0027\\n\\n Silence.\\n\\n After a few awkward seconds had passed Carl spoke.\\n\\n \u0027Bloody hell, let\u0027s just do it. We\u0027re never going to achieve anything just standing out here like this, are we?\u0027\\n\\n That was all that Michael needed to hear. With that he strode up behind the woman, reached out and rested his hands on her shoulders. She stopped moving instantly.\\n\\n Emma jogged the last few steps and moved round to stand in front of the body. She looked up into her glazed eyes and saw that they seemed unfocussed and vacant. Her skin was pale and taut, as if it had been stretched tight across her skull. Although she was sure that the body couldn\u0027t see her (she didn\u0027t even seem to know she was there) Emma respectfully tried to hide her mounting revulsion. There was a deep gash on the woman\u0027s right temple. Dark blood had been flowing freely from the wound for some time and had drenched her once smart white blouse and grey business suit.\\n\\n \u0027We want to help you,\u0027 she said softly.\\n\\n Still no reaction.\\n\\n Michael gripped the woman\u0027s shoulders a little tighter and shuffled closer.\\n\\n \u0027Come on,\u0027 he whispered, \u0027let\u0027s get you inside.\u0027\\n\\n Carl and Kate watched the others with a morbid fascination.\\n\\n \u0027What the hell is happening?\u0027 Kate asked, her voice gradually becoming noticeably weaker and more unsteady each time she spoke.\\n\\n \u0027No idea,\u0027 Carl admitted. \u0027Bloody hell, I wish I knew.\u0027\\n\\n He surveyed the desperate scene around them. Not all of the bodies had moved. The majority still lay where they had fallen.\\n\\n \u0027Carl,\u0027 Michael shouted.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 he mumbled nervously, turning back to face the others.\\n\\n \u0027Give us a hand, mate. Could you get hold of her legs?\u0027\\n\\n Carl nodded and walked over towards Emma and Michael. He crouched down and grabbed the woman\u0027s bony ankles, one in each hand, and, as Michael pulled back on her shoulders, he lifted her feet. She was surprisingly light. There was no weight to her at all and she didn\u0027t react to being moved.\\n\\n The two men scuttled back to the community hall, closely followed by Emma and Kate. As they approached the doorway the survivors (who had continued watching intently throughout) quickly realised what was happening. They scattered like a shoal of frightened fish that had just been invaded by the deadliest predator shark.\\n\\n \u0027What the bloody hell are you doing?\u0027 Ralph stammered as Carl and Michael barged past him. \u0027What the hell are you doing bringing that in here?\u0027\\n\\n Michael didn\u0027t answer. He was too busy directing the others.\\n\\n \u0027Group yourselves around her,\u0027 he said authoritatively. \u0027Try and cage her in.\u0027\\n\\n Obediently Kate and Emma drew closer, as did another two survivors whose names Michael did not know. Carl gently lowered the sick woman\u0027s feet to the ground so that she was standing upright again and then took a couple of steps back so that he was level with the others. Once something resembling a circle had been formed and he was happy, Michael let go.\\n\\n For a second the body did nothing. Then, without warning, it lurched towards Kate who screwed up her face in nervous trepidation and stretched her arms out in front of her to prevent the woman from getting too close. As soon as she made contact with Kate\u0027s outstretched hands the woman turned and staggered away in the opposite direction towards another survivor. This continued every time the edge of the circle was reached.\\n\\n As the woman stumbled towards Michael he allowed himself for the first time to look deep into her face. For a dangerous few seconds he found himself transfixed, looking at the pitiful creature in front of him and wondering how she might have looked just a week earlier. A few days ago he might have found her attractive but, today, her emotionless gaze and drawn, almost translucent skin immediately dissipated any beauty or serenity that her face had previously known. There was an unnatural sheen to her exposed flesh. Michael noticed that her skin had a grey, almost light green tone and a greasy shine and it was tightly stretched over the bones of her skull. What had at first glance appeared to be dark bags under her frozen eyes were, in fact, the prominent ridges of her eye sockets. Her mouth hung open - a huge, dark hole - and a thick string of gelatinous saliva trickled continually down the side of her chin. He pushed her away.\\n\\n The woman turned and began to stagger towards Carl. Clearly unable to control or co-ordinate her own movements, she tripped over her own clumsy feet and half-fell, half-lurched towards him. He recoiled and pushed her down to the ground, feeling a cold sweat prickle his brow as the pathetic and diseased creature scrambled back up onto its feet.\\n\\n \u0027Can she hear us?\u0027 Kate wondered. She hadn\u0027t really meant to ask the question, she\u0027d just been thinking out loud.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 Michael answered.\\n\\n \u0027She probably can,\u0027 Emma said.\\n\\n \u0027Why do you say that?\u0027\\n\\n She shrugged her shoulders.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s something about the way she reacts.\u0027\\n\\n Ralph, who had until then been watching nervously from a corner of the room, found himself being drawn closer and closer to the circle of survivors.\\n\\n \u0027But she doesn\u0027t react,\u0027 he stammered, his voice uncharacteristically light and shaky.\\n\\n \u0027I know,\u0027 Emma continued. \u0027That\u0027s what I mean. She\u0027s walking and moving around, but I don\u0027t think she knows why or how.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s instinctive,\u0027 Carl muttered.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s what I\u0027m starting to think,\u0027 Emma agreed. \u0027She probably can hear us, but she doesn\u0027t know what the noises we make mean anymore. I bet she\u0027s still capable of speaking, she just can\u0027t remember how to.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But she reacts when you touch her,\u0027 Paul Garner jabbered anxiously.\\n\\n \u0027No she doesn\u0027t. She doesn\u0027t react at all. She turns away because she physically can\u0027t keep moving in a certain direction. I bet she\u0027d just keep walking in a straight line forever if there wasn\u0027t anything in her way.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Christ, look at her,\u0027 Kate mumbled. \u0027Just look at the poor cow. How many millions of people like this are wandering around out there?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did you check her pulse?\u0027 Michael whispered to Emma who was standing next to him.\\n\\n \u0027Sort of,\u0027 she replied, her voice equally low.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\u0027 he hissed, annoyed by her vagueness.\\n\\n \u0027I couldn\u0027t find one,\u0027 she answered bluntly.\\n\\n \u0027So what are you saying?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not saying anything.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So what are you thinking?\u0027\\n\\n Emma glanced across at him and shrugged her shoulders.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 she admitted.\\n\\n \u0027Get it out of here,\u0027 Garner hissed nervously from his vantage point in a doorway a safe distance away.\\n\\n Michael looked around the circle and noticed that the others were suddenly either looking at the ground or looking at him. Sensing that it was up to him to make the next move he took a step forward and grabbed hold of the diseased woman\u0027s arm. He pulled her gently out of the hall and back towards the door which he opened with his free hand. He pushed her out into the sunlight and watched as she staggered away from the building and back across the car park. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1/page-10.html","bookId":2557,"book":{"id":2557,"title":"Autumn (Autumn #1)","description":"Storyline: Autumn (Autumn #1) \\n A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, Autumn chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... \\n Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, Autumn offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-autumn-1.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:48:44 AM"}}
