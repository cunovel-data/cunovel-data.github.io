{"id":112038,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"Despite the fact that each one of the survivors had reached new levels of emotional and mental exhaustion, not one of them could even contemplate trying to sleep. This lack of sleep meant that the disparate body of frightened and desperate people were becoming even more frightened and desperate with each passing minute. The hall was lit only by a few dim gas lamps and the odd torch, and this lack of light seemed to compound the disorientation and fear felt by all of them. By midnight the tensions and frustrations felt by even the most placid members of the group had risen to dangerously high levels.\\n\\n Jenny Hall, who had held her three month old baby boy in her arms as he died on Tuesday morning, had dared to complain about the food she\u0027d been given earlier in the evening. Although she\u0027d meant nothing by her innocent comments, the cook - the usually quiet and reserved Stuart Jeffries - had taken it personally.\\n\\n \u0027You stupid fucking bitch,\u0027 he screamed, his face literally millimeters from hers. \u0027What gives you the right to criticise? Fucking hell, you\u0027re not the only one who\u0027s had it tough. Christ, we\u0027re all in the same fucking boat here...\u0027\\n\\n Jenny wiped streaming tears from her face with shaking hands. She was convulsing with fear and could hardly co-ordinate her movements.\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t mean to...\u0027 she stammered. \u0027I was only trying to...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shut your mouth!\u0027 Stuart shouted, grabbing hold of her arms and pinning her against the wall. \u0027Just shut your fucking mouth!\u0027\\n\\n For a second Michael just stood and watched, stunned and numbed and unable to quite comprehend what he was seeing. He quickly managed to snap himself out of his disbelieving trance and actually do something to help. He grabbed hold of Stuart and yanked him away from Jenny, leaving her to slide down the wall and collapse in a sobbing heap on the dirty brown floor.\\n\\n \u0027Bastard,\u0027 she spat, looking up at him. \u0027You fucking bastard.\u0027\\n\\n Michael manhandled Stuart across the room and pushed him down into a chair.\\n\\n \u0027What the hell is going on?\u0027 he demanded.\\n\\n Stuart didn\u0027t respond. He sat staring at the floor. His face was flushed red. His fists were clenched tight and his body shook with anger.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s the problem?\u0027 Michael asked again.\\n\\n Stuart still didn\u0027t move.\\n\\n \u0027Not good enough for her, are we?\u0027 he eventually muttered.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That little bitch,\u0027 he seethed. \u0027Thinks she\u0027s something special, doesn\u0027t she? Thinks she\u0027s a cut above the rest of us.\u0027 He looked up and stared and pointed at Jenny. \u0027Thinks she\u0027s the only one who\u0027s lost everything.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re not making any sense,\u0027 Michael said, sitting down on a bench close to Stuart. \u0027What are you talking about?\u0027\\n\\n Stuart couldn\u0027t - or wouldn\u0027t - answer. Tears of frustration welled in his tired eyes. Rather than let Michael see the extent of his fraught emotion he got up and stormed out of the room, slamming the door shut behind him.\\n\\n \u0027What was all that about?\u0027 Emma asked as she walked past Michael and made her way over to where Jenny lay on the ground. She crouched down and put her arm around her shoulders. \u0027Come on,\u0027 she whispered, gently kissing the top of her head. \u0027It\u0027s all right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right?\u0027 she sobbed. \u0027How can you say it\u0027s all right? After everything that\u0027s happened, how can you say it\u0027s all right?\u0027\\n\\n Kate James sat down next to them. Cradling Jenny in her arms, Emma turned to face Kate.\\n\\n \u0027Did you see what happened?\u0027 she quietly asked.\\n\\n \u0027Not really,\u0027 Kate replied. \u0027They were just talking. I only realised that something was wrong when Stuart started shouting. He was fine one minute - you know, calm and talking normally - and then he just exploded at her.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027\\n\\n Kate shrugged her shoulders.\\n\\n \u0027Apparently she told him that she didn\u0027t like the soup.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 asked Emma incredulously.\\n\\n \u0027She didn\u0027t like the soup he\u0027d made,\u0027 Kate repeated. \u0027I\u0027m sure that\u0027s all it was.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bloody hell,\u0027 she sighed, shaking her head in resignation.\\n\\n Carl walked into the room with Jack Baynham. He\u0027d taken no more than two or three steps when he stopped, quickly sensing that something was wrong.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s the matter?\u0027 he asked cautiously, almost too afraid to listen to the answer. The atmosphere in the room was so heavy that he was convinced something terrible had happened.\\n\\n Michael shook his head.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s nothing,\u0027 he said. \u0027It\u0027s sorted now.\u0027\\n\\n Carl looked down at Emma on the floor and Jenny curled up in her arms. Something obviously had happened but, as whatever it was seemed to have been confined to inside the hall and resolved, he decided not to ask any more questions. He just didn\u0027t want to get involved. Selfish and insensitive of him it may have been, but he didn\u0027t want to know. He had enough problems of his own without getting himself wrapped up in other people\u0027s.\\n\\n Michael felt much the same, but he found it impossible to be as private and insular as Carl. When he heard more crying coming from another dark corner of the room he instinctively went to investigate. He found that the tears were coming from Annie Nelson and Jessica Short, two of the eldest survivors. The two ladies were wrapped under a single blanket, holding each other tightly and doing their best to stop sobbing and stop drawing attention to themselves. Michael sat down next to them.\\n\\n \u0027You two okay? he asked. A pointless question, but he couldn\u0027t think of anything else to say.\\n\\n Annie smiled for the briefest of moments and nodded, trying hard to put on a brave face. She nonchalantly wiped away a single tear which trickled quickly down her wrinkled cheek.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re all right, thank you,\u0027 she replied, her voice light and fragile.\\n\\n \u0027Can I get you anything?\u0027\\n\\n Annie shook her head.\\n\\n \u0027No, we\u0027re fine,\u0027 she said. \u0027I think we\u0027ll try and get some sleep now.\u0027\\n\\n Michael smiled and rested his hand on hers. He tried not to let his worry show, but her hand felt disconcertingly cold and fragile. He really did feel so sorry for these two. He had noticed that they had been inseparable since arriving at the hall. Jessica, he had learned from Emma, was a well-to-do widow who had lived in a large house in one of the most exclusive suburbs of Northwich. Annie, on the other hand, had told him yesterday that she\u0027d lived in the same two bedroom Victorian terraced house all her life. She\u0027d been born there and, as she\u0027d wasted no time in telling him, she intended to see out the rest of her days there too. When things settled down again, she\u0027d explained naively, she was going to go straight back home. She had even invited Jessica over for tea one afternoon.\\n\\n Michael patted the old lady\u0027s hand again and stood up and walked away. He glanced back over his shoulder and watched as the two pensioners huddled closer together and talked in frightened, hushed whispers. Clearly from opposite ends of the social spectrum, they seemed to be drawn to each other for no other reason than their similar ages. Money, position, possessions, friends and connections didn\u0027t count for anything anymore.\\n\\n Emma was still sitting on the floor two hours later. As half-past two approached she cursed herself for being so bloody selfless. There she was, cold and uncomfortable, still cradling Jenny Hall in her arms. What made matters worse was the Jenny had herself been asleep for the best part of an hour. Why am I always the one who ends up doing this, she thought? Christ, no-one ever bothers to hold me and rock me to sleep. Why am I always the one giving out? Emma didn\u0027t really need any help or support, but it pissed her off that no-one ever seemed to offer.\\n\\n The hall was silent but for a muffled conversation taking place in one of the dark rooms off the main hall. Emma carefully eased herself out from underneath Jenny and lay her down on the floor and covered her with a sheet. In the still silence every sound she made, no matter how slight, seemed deafening. As she moved Jenny\u0027s body she listened carefully and tried to locate the precise source of the conversation. She was desperate for some calm and rational adult company.\\n\\n The voices seemed to be coming from a little room that she hadn\u0027t been into before. Cautiously she pushed the door open and peered inside. It was pitch black, and the voices stopped immediately.\\n\\n \u0027Who\u0027s that?\u0027 a man asked.\\n\\n \u0027Emma,\u0027 she whispered. \u0027Emma Mitchell.\u0027\\n\\n As her eyes slowly became accustomed to the darkness of the room (which was, surprisingly, even darker and gloomier than the main hall) she saw that there were two men sitting with their backs against the far wall. It was Michael and Carl. They were drinking water from a plastic bottle which they passed between themselves.\\n\\n \u0027You okay?\u0027 Michael asked.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m fine,\u0027 Emma replied. \u0027Mind if I come in?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not at all,\u0027 said Carl. \u0027Everything calmed down out there?\u0027\\n\\n She stepped into the room, tripping over his outstretched legs and feeling for the nearest wall in the darkness. She sat down carefully.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s all quiet,\u0027 she said. \u0027I just had to get away, know what I mean?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why do you think we\u0027re sitting in here?\u0027 Michael asked rhetorically.\\n\\n After a short silence Emma spoke again.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 she said apologetically. \u0027Have I interrupted something? Did you two want me to go so you can...?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Stay here as long as you like,\u0027 Michael answered. Emma\u0027s eyes were slowly becoming accustomed to the darkness and she could now just about make out the details of the two men\u0027s faces.\\n\\n \u0027I think everyone\u0027s asleep out there. At least if they\u0027re not asleep then they\u0027re being very quiet. I guess they\u0027re all thinking about what happened today. I\u0027ve just sat and listened to Jenny talking about...\u0027 Emma realised she was talking for the sake of talking and let her words trail away into silence. Both Michael and Carl were staring at her. \u0027What\u0027s the matter?\u0027 she asked, suddenly self-conscious. \u0027What\u0027s wrong?\u0027\\n\\n Michael shook his head.\\n\\n \u0027Bloody hell,\u0027 he sighed, \u0027have you been out there with Jenny all this time?\u0027\\n\\n She nodded.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, why?\u0027\\n\\n He shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n \u0027Nothing, I just don\u0027t know why you bother, that\u0027s all.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Someone\u0027s got to do it, haven\u0027t they?\u0027 she replied nonchalantly as she accepted a drink from the bottle of water that Carl passed to her.\\n\\n \u0027So why does it have to be you? Christ, who\u0027s going to sit up with you for hours when you\u0027re...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Like I said,\u0027 she interrupted, \u0027someone\u0027s got to do it. If we all shut ourselves away in rooms like this when things aren\u0027t going well then we haven\u0027t got much of a future here, have we?\u0027\\n\\n Emma was immediately defensive of her own actions, despite the fact that she\u0027d silently criticised herself for exactly the same thing just a few minutes earlier.\\n\\n \u0027So do you think we\u0027ve got a future here then?\u0027 asked Carl. Now Emma really was beginning to feel uncomfortable. She hadn\u0027t come in here to be picked on.\\n\\n \u0027Of course we\u0027ve got a future,\u0027 she snapped.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ve got millions of people lying dead in the streets around us and we\u0027ve got people threatening to kill each other because someone doesn\u0027t like soup. Doesn\u0027t bode well really, does it?\u0027 Michael mused.\\n\\n Another silence.\\n\\n \u0027So what do you think?\u0027 Emma asked. \u0027You seem to have an opinion about everything. Do you reckon we\u0027ve got any chance, or do you think we should just curl up in the corner and give up?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think we\u0027ve got a damn good chance, but not necessarily here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where then?\u0027 she wondered.\\n\\n \u0027Well what have we got here?\u0027 Michael began. \u0027We\u0027ve got shelter of sorts, we\u0027ve got limited supplies and we\u0027ve got access to what\u0027s left of the city. We\u0027ve also got an unlimited supply of dead bodies - some of them mobile - which are going to rot. Agree?\u0027\\n\\n The other two thought for a moment and then nodded.\\n\\n \u0027And I suppose,\u0027 he continued, \u0027there\u0027s also the flip-side of the coin. As good a shelter as this is, it\u0027s fast becoming a prison. We\u0027ve got no idea what\u0027s around us. We don\u0027t even know what\u0027s in the buildings on the other side of the street.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But it\u0027s going to be the same wherever we go...\u0027 Emma remarked.\\n\\n \u0027Possibly. Carl and I were talking about heading out to the countryside earlier, and the more I think about it the more it seems to make sense.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027\\n\\n Carl explained, remembering the conversation he\u0027d had with Michael a few hours ago.\\n\\n \u0027The population\u0027s concentrated in cities, isn\u0027t it? There will be less bodies out in the sticks. And less bodies equals less problems...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hopefully,\u0027 Michael added cautiously.\\n\\n \u0027So what\u0027s stopping us?\u0027 Emma asked.\\n\\n \u0027Nothing,\u0027 Michael replied.\\n\\n \u0027Are you sure that you want to go?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Positive.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And what if no-one else does?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tough. I\u0027ll go on my own.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And when are you going to go?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027As soon as I can. I\u0027d go tomorrow if I could.\u0027\\n\\n Emma had to admit that, arrogant and superior as he tended to sound, Michael\u0027s logic and reasoning made sense. The more she listened to and thought about his proposals, the more hopeful she became. Fired up with a new found enthusiasm and purpose, the three survivors talked through the first few long, dragging hours of the new day. By four o\u0027clock that morning their plans were made. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1/page-12.html","bookId":2557,"book":{"id":2557,"title":"Autumn (Autumn #1)","description":"Storyline: Autumn (Autumn #1) \\n A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, Autumn chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... \\n Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, Autumn offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-autumn-1.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:48:44 AM"}}
