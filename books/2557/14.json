Between the three of them everything they had was condensed into the sum total of five carrier bags and two boxes. She breathed a sigh of relief at three minutes to eleven when Carl and Michael returned. The others had hardly spoken to her in all the time that the two men had been away from the community centre. It was almost as if she had suddenly ceased to exist. The rest of the survivors seemed to think that they were being abandoned, and Emma had real difficulty trying to understand why they felt that way. The invitation still stood for any of them - all of them if they wanted - to leave with Michael, Carl and herself. She guessed that the only thing stopping them was uncertainty and their personal and irrational fears of stepping outside the creaky wooden building. Countless times in those few hours she looked up and made eye contact with other people, only for them to look away again quickly. Countless times she heard people whispering behind her back. She knew that they were talking about her because nothing was private anymore. The eerie silence inside the hall amplified every spiteful word. \u0027Everything all right?\u0027 she asked as Michael parked the van in front of the building and clambered out and stretched. \u0027Fine,\u0027 he replied quietly, flashing her a quick and reassuring smile as he did so. \u0027You okay?\u0027 She nodded. Carl walked around from the other side of the van. \u0027We got everything we need,\u0027 he said. \u0027What do you think of the transport?\u0027 She nodded again and slowly walked around the large family car. There were seven seats inside, two at the front, two at the back and three in the middle. The front two seats and the seat behind the driver\u0027s were empty. The others were piled high with supplies. As she looked through the tinted glass windows it suddenly occurred to her that they were standing outside and, for the first time since it had all began, none of them seemed to be giving a damn about what had happened to the devastated world around them. They were surrounded by bodies - some still, some moving - and yet today she wasn\u0027t the least bit bothered. Perhaps it was because they were about to leave. Maybe deciding that she didn\u0027t need the protection of the hall anymore had subconsciously changed her way of thinking. \u0027Have any trouble while you were out there?\u0027 she asked, snapping herself out of her daydream. \u0027Trouble?\u0027 Carl replied, surprised. \u0027What kind of trouble?\u0027 She shrugged her shoulders. \u0027I don\u0027t know. Christ, you spent the morning in the middle of a city full of walking corpses. I don\u0027t know what you saw. Did you...\u0027 Michael interrupted. \u0027Nothing happened,\u0027 he said abruptly. \u0027There were plenty of bodies walking around, but nothing happened.\u0027 \u0027Not as many as I expected though,\u0027 Carl added. \u0027That\u0027s because they\u0027re starting to spread out,\u0027 Michael grunted as he shoved their carrier bags and boxes into the back of the van. \u0027Spread out?\u0027 said Emma. \u0027It\u0027s the blotting paper effect, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 \u0027Is it?\u0027 Michael stopped and turned to face her. \u0027When all this started there was a high concentration of bodies in the middle of the city, wasn\u0027t there? People were at work and school, weren\u0027t they?\u0027 \u0027Yes...\u0027 she replied, unsure where the conversation was leading. \u0027So if those of them that are up and moving around are walking randomly, it stands to reason that they\u0027ve spread out from the centre of the city like ink spreads across blotting paper.\u0027 \u0027I see...\u0027 she mumbled, far from convinced. \u0027It might take a while, but it\u0027s started and I bet that\u0027s what will happen.\u0027 He returned his attention to loading the last two bags into the van. Emma continued to think, trying hard to follow through the route of his logic. \u0027So,\u0027 she eventually continued, \u0027if what you\u0027re saying is right, given time there could be equal numbers of bodies all over the country?\u0027 Michael thought for a moment. \u0027Suppose so. Why?\u0027 \u0027Because if that\u0027s the case,\u0027 she said quietly, \u0027why the hell are we bothering to run?\u0027 \u0027We\u0027re not running,\u0027 he snapped, deliberately avoiding the very valid point of her comment. \u0027We\u0027re backed into a corner here. What we\u0027re doing is giving ourselves a chance.\u0027 Sensing that the conversation had opened up a particularly unpleasant can of worms, he slammed and locked the van door and headed back inside. The silence which greeted Michael as he walked back into the main hall was the most ominous silence he\u0027d heard since he\u0027d first arrived there days earlier. The rest of the survivors - all twenty or so frightened individuals - stopped and stared at him, Carl and Emma in unspoken unison. Some of those people hadn\u0027t acknowledged him in all the time they\u0027d been at the community centre. Some hadn\u0027t even spoken a word to anyone since they\u0027d got there. And yet, suddenly and unexpectedly, Michael got the distinct impression that it was the three of them against the rest. There was real animosity and anger in the room. It felt like betrayal. The wave of hostility stopped Michael in his tracks. He turned around to face Emma and Carl. The three of them found themselves exposed and stood together in the centre of the room. \u0027What\u0027s all this about?\u0027 he asked, keeping his voice low. \u0027It\u0027s been like this since you went,\u0027 Emma replied. \u0027The rest of them seem to have a real problem with what we\u0027re doing.\u0027 \u0027Fucking idiots,\u0027 Carl snapped. \u0027It\u0027s because they know we\u0027re right. We should tell them that...\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ll tell them nothing,\u0027 Michael ordered. The surprising authority in his voice silenced and stunned Carl. \u0027Let\u0027s just go.\u0027 \u0027What, now?\u0027 Emma said, surprised. \u0027Are we ready? Do we need to...\u0027 Michael glanced at her. The expression on his face left her in no doubt as to his intentions. \u0027What are we going to gain from waiting around?\u0027 he hissed. \u0027We\u0027re better off travelling in daylight so let\u0027s make the most of it. Let\u0027s get out of here.\u0027 \u0027Are you sure...?\u0027 Carl began. \u0027You sound like you\u0027re having doubts?\u0027 Michael snapped, the tone of his voice seeming almost to carry a sneer. \u0027You can stop here if you want to...\u0027 Carl shook his head and looked away, feeling intimidated and pressured. \u0027Oh bollocks to it,\u0027 Emma said, her voice now a fraction louder. \u0027You\u0027re right. Let\u0027s just get out of here.\u0027 Michael turned back to face the rest of the survivors who still stared at him and his companions. He cleared his throat. He didn\u0027t know what to say or why he was even bothering to try and say anything. It just didn\u0027t seem right to walk out without trying one last time to persuade the rest of them to try and see the sense in what they were doing. \u0027We\u0027re leaving,\u0027 he began, his words echoing around the cold wooden room. \u0027If any of you want to...\u0027 \u0027Fuck off,\u0027 Stuart Jeffries spat, getting up from his chair and walking up to Michael. The two men stood face to face. \u0027Just get in your damn car and fuck off now,\u0027 he hissed. \u0027You\u0027re putting us at risk. Every second you spend here is a second too long.\u0027 Michael looked into his tired face for what seemed like an eternity. There were countless things he could have said to Jeffries and the others - countless reasons why they should follow and not stay locked in the community centre - but the anger bordering on hate in the other man\u0027s eyes left him in no doubt that to say anything would be pointless. \u0027Come on,\u0027 Emma said, grabbing his arm and pulling him away. Michael looked around the room one last time and stared back at each one of the desperate faces which stared at him. Then he turned his back and walked. Carl led the way out, closely followed by the other two. Just seconds after taking their first steps out into the cold afternoon air the door of the community centre was slammed and locked shut behind them. Sensing that there was no turning back (and feeling suddenly nervous and unsure) the three survivors exchanged anxious glances and climbed into the van. Michael started the engine and drove out towards the main road, pausing only to let a single willowy-framed, greasy-skinned body stagger oblivious past the front of the van.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1/page-14.html","bookId":2557,"book":{"id":2557,"title":"Autumn (Autumn #1)","description":"Storyline: Autumn (Autumn #1) A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, Autumn chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, Autumn offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-autumn-1.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:48:44 AM"}}
