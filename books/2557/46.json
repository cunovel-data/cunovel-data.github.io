We\u0027re not going to sit here like fucking prisoners for the rest of our days. Something\u0027s going to happen tonight.\n When I was running back to the house I was faster than the lot of them. I could outrun them. They\u0027re nothing, just bags of skin and bone. They don\u0027t have any strength and there isn\u0027t a single one of them that can hurt me.\n I keep seeing Sarah and Gemma\u0027s faces and I can hear Sarah telling me what to do. She\u0027s telling me that she wants me to make a go of this. She\u0027s telling me that she wants me to get off my backside and make a stand.\n I can hear Emma and Michael talking about getting away again.\n The only way we can do it is if we fight.\n When I\u0027m ready I\u0027m going to show every last one of those bastards outside who\u0027s in charge. They\u0027re weak and they\u0027re sick and I\u0027m strong.\n I\u0027m going to take them out.\n One at a time. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1/page-46.html","bookId":2557,"book":{"id":2557,"title":"Autumn (Autumn #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Autumn (Autumn #1) \n A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, Autumn chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... \n Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, Autumn offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-autumn-1.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:48:44 AM"}}
