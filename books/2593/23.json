It\u0027s like zero zero zero point oh one percentage - \"\\n\\n Luckily, the long version of \"New Sensation\" by INXS drowns out his voice. The music is so loud that conversation is possible only by screaming. The club is fairly packed; the only real light coming in flashes off the dance floor. Everyone is wearing a tuxedo. Everyone is drinking champagne. Since we only have two VIP Basement passes Price shoves them at McDermott and Van Patten and they eagerly wave the cards at the guy guarding the top of the stairs. The guy who lets them pass is wearing a double-breasted wool tuxedo, a cotton wing-collar shirt by Cerruti 1881 and a black and white checkered silk bow tie from Martin Dingman Neckwear.\\n\\n \"Hey,\" I shout to Price. \"Why didn\u0027t we use those?\"\\n\\n \"Because,\" he screams over the music, grabbing me by the collar, \"we need some Bolivian Marching Powder...\"\\n\\n I follow him as he rushes through the narrow corridor that runs parallel to the dance floor, then into the bar and finally into the Chandelier Room, which is jammed with guys from Drexel, from Lehman\u0027s, from Kidder Peabody, from First Boston, from Morgan Stanley, from Rothschild, from Goldman, even from Citibank for Christ sakes, all of them wearing tuxedos, holding champagne flutes, and effortlessly, almost as if it were the same song, \"New Sensation\" segues into \"The Devil Inside\" and Price spots Ted Madison leaning against the railing in the back of the room, wearing a double-breasted wool tuxedo, a wing-collar cotton shirt from Paul Smith, a bow tie and cummerbund from Rainbow Neckwear, diamond studs from Trianon, patent-leather and grosgrain pumps by Ferragamo and an antique Hamilton watch from Saks; and past Madison, disappearing into darkness, are the twin train tracks which tonight are lit garishly in preppy greens and pinks and Price suddenly stops walking, stares past Ted, who smiles knowingly when he spots Timothy, and Price gazes longingly at the tracks as if they suggest some kind of freedom, embody an escape that Price has been searching for, but I shout out to him, \"Hey, there\u0027s Teddy,\" and this breaks his gaze and he shakes his head as if to clear it, refocuses his gaze on Madison and shouts decisively, \"No, that\u0027s not Madison for Christ sakes, that\u0027s Turnball,\" and the guy who I thought was Madison is greeted by two other guys in tuxedos and he turns his back to us and suddenly, behind Price, Ebersol wraps an arm around Timothy\u0027s neck and laughingly pretends to strangle him, then Price pushes the arm away, shakes Ebersol\u0027s hand and says, \"Hey Madison.\"\\n\\n Madison, who I thought was Ebersol, is wearing a splendid double-breasted white linen jacket by Hackett of London from Bergdorf Goodman. He has a cigar that hasn\u0027t been lit in one hand and a champagne glass, half full, in the other.\\n\\n \"Mr. Price,\" shouts Madison. \"Very good to see you, sir.\"\\n\\n \"Madison,\" Price cries back. \"We need your services.\"\\n\\n \"Looking for trouble?\" Madison smiles.\\n\\n \"Something more immediate,\" Price shouts back.\\n\\n \"Of course,\" Madison shouts and then, coolly for some reason, nods at me, shouting, I think, \"Bateman,\" and then, \"Nice tan.\"\\n\\n A guy standing behind Madison who looks a lot like Ted Dreyer is wearing a double-breasted shawl-collared tuxedo, a cotton shirt and a silk tartan bow tie, all of it, I\u0027m fairly sure, from Polo by Ralph Lauren. Madison stands around, nodding to various people who pass by in the crush.\\n\\n Finally Price loses his cool. \"Listen. We need drugs,\" I think I hear him shout.\\n\\n \"Patience, Price, patience,\" Madison shouts. \"I\u0027ll talk to Ricardo.\"\\n\\n But he still stands there, nodding to people who push past\\n\\n \"Like what about now?\" Price screams.\\n\\n \"Why aren\u0027t you wearing a tux?\" Madison shouts.\\n\\n \"How much do we want?\" Price asks me, looking desperate.\\n\\n \"A gram is fine,\" I shout. \"I have to be at the office early tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"Do you have cash?\"\\n\\n I can\u0027t lie, nod, hand him forty.\\n\\n \"A gram,\" Price shouts to Ted\\n\\n \"Hey,\" Madison says, introducing his friend, \"this is You.\"\\n\\n \"A gram.\" Price presses cash into Madison s hand. \"You? What?\"\\n\\n This guy and Madison both smile and Ted shakes his head and shouts a name I can\u0027t hear.\\n\\n \"No,\" Madison shouts, \"Hugh.\" I think.\\n\\n \"Yeah. Great to meet you, Hugh.\" Price holds up his wrist and taps the gold Rolex with his index finger.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be right back,\" Madison shouts. \"Keep my friend company. Use your drink tickets.\" He disappears. You, Hugh, Who, fades into the crowd. I follow Price over to the railings. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-23.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
