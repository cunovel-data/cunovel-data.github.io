{"id":96540,"no":81,"title":"Page 81","content":"\"I think I should talk to Mr. Owen first,\" the driver says, amused, toying with me. \"No, wait!\" I say, then calming down, \"Listen, I\u0027m... it\u0027s fine, really.\" I start chuckling to myself. \"Mr. Owen is in a very, very bad mood.\" \"I\u0027m not supposed to do this,\" the driver says without looking up at me. \"It\u0027s totally illegal. No way. Give it up.\" \"Oh come on, man,\" I say. \"It\u0027s totally against company regulations,\" he says. \"Fuck company regulations,\" I bark out at him. \"Fuck company regulations?\" he asks, nodding, smiling. \"Mr. Owen says it\u0027s okay,\" I say. \"Maybe you\u0027re not listening.\" \"Nope. No can do.\" He shakes his head I pause, stand up straight, run a hand over my face, breathe in and then lean back down. \"Listen to me...\" I breathe in again. \"They\u0027ve got midgets in there.\" I point with a thumb back at the brownstone. \"Midgets who are about to sing \u0027O Tannenbaum\u0027...\" I look at him imploringly, begging for sympathy, at the same time looking appropriately frightened. \"Do you know how scarythat is? Elves\" - I gulp - \"harmonizing?\" I pause, then quickly ask, \"Think about it.\" \"Listen, mister - \" \"Marcus,\" I remind him. \"Marcus. Whatever. I\u0027m not gonna break the rules. I can\u0027t do anything about it. It\u0027s company rules. I\u0027m not gonna break \u0027em.\" We both lapse into silence. I sigh, look around, considering dragging Evelyn to the third limo, or maybe back to Barker\u0027s limo - he\u0027s a real ass**le - but no, goddamnit, I want Owen\u0027s. Meanwhile the driver sighs to himself, \"If the midgets want to sing, let them sing.\" \"Shit,\" I curse, taking out my gazelleskin wallet. \"Here\u0027s a hundred.\" I hand him two fifties. \"Two hundred,\" he says. \u0027\"This city sucks,\" I mutter, handing the money over. \"Where do you want to go?\" he asks, taking the bills with a sigh, as he starts the limousine. \"Club Chernoble,\" I say, rushing to the back and opening the door. \"Yes sir,\" he shouts. I hop in, shutting the door just as the driver peels away from Evelyn\u0027s brownstone toward Riverside Drive. Evelyn\u0027s sitting next to me while I\u0027m catching my breath, wiping cold sweat off my brow with an Armani handkerchief. When I look over at her, she\u0027s on the verge of tears, her lips trembling, silent for once. \"You\u0027re startling me. What happened?\" I am alarmed. \"What... what did I do? The Waldorf salad was good. What else?\" \"Oh Patrick,\" she sighs. \"It\u0027s... lovely. I don\u0027t know what to say.\" \"Well...\" I pause carefully. \"I don\u0027t... either.\" \u0027This,\" she says, presenting me with a diamond necklace from Tiffany\u0027s, Meredith\u0027s present from Owen. \"Well, help me put it on, darling. You\u0027re not the Grinch, honey.\" \"Uh, Evelyn,\" I say, then curse under my breath as she turns her back toward me so I can clasp it around her neck. The limousine lurches forward and she falls against me, laughing. then kisses my cheek. \"It\u0027s lovely, oh I love it... Oops, must have true breath. Sorry, honey. Find me some champagne and pour me a glass.\" \"But...\" I stare helplessly at the glittering necklace. \"That\u0027s not it.\" \"What?\" Evelyn asks, looking around the limo. \"Are there glasses in here? What\u0027s not it, honey?\" \u0027\"That\u0027s not it.\" I\u0027m speaking in monotone. \"Oh, honey.\" She smiles. \"You have something else for me?\" \"No, I mean - \" \"Come on, you devil,\" she says, playfully grabbing at my coat pocket. \"Come on, what is it?\" \"What is what?\" I ask calmly, annoyed. \"You\u0027ve got something else. Let me guess. A ring to match?\" she guesses. \"A matching bracelet? A brooch? So that\u0027s itl\" She claps her hands. \"It\u0027s a matching brooch.\" While I\u0027m trying to push her away from me, holding one of her arms back, the other snakes behind me and grabs something out of my pocket - another fortune cookie I lifted from the dead Chinese boy. She stares at it, puzzled for a moment, and says, \"Patrick, you\u0027re so... romantic,\" and then, studying the fortune cookie and with less enthusiasm, \"so... original.\" I\u0027m also staring at the fortune cookie. It\u0027s got a lot of blood on it and I shrug and say, as jovially as I can, \"Oh, you know me.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-81.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
