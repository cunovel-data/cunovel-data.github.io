Do you want to go?\"\n \"Hold on,\" I say.\n I get back on the line with Craig and Van Patten.\n \"Bateman?\" Van Patten asks. \"What the f**k are you doing?\"\n \"How the hell does Cindy know we\u0027re having dinner at Kaktus?\" I demand.\n \"Hamlin told her?\" McDermott guesses. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\n \"Because now Evelyn knows,\" I say.\n \"When the f**k is Wolfgang Puck going to open a restaurant in this goddamn city?\" Van Patten asks us.\n \"Is Van Patten on his third six-pack of Fosters or is he still, like, working on his first?\" I ask McDermott.\n \"The question you\u0027re asking, Patrick,\" McDermott begins, \"is, should we exclude the women or not? Right?\"\n \"Something is turning into nothing very quickly,\" I warn. \"That\u0027s all I\u0027m saying.\"\n \"Should you invite Evelyn?\" McDermott asks. \"Is this what you want to know?\"\n \"No, we should not,\" I stress.\n \"Well, hey, I wanted to bring Elizabeth,\" Van Patten says timidly (mock-timidly?).\n \"No,\" I say. \"No women.\"\n \"What\u0027s wrong with Elizabeth?\" Van Patten asks.\n \"Yeah?\" McDermott follows.\n \"She\u0027s an idiot. No, she\u0027s intelligent. I can\u0027t tell. Don\u0027t invite her,\" I say.\n After a pause I hear Van Patten say, \"I sense weirdness starting.\"\n \"Well, if not Elizabeth, what about Sylvia josephs?\" McDermott suggests.\n \"Nah, too old to f**k,\" Van Patten says.\n \"Oh Christ,\" McDermott says. \"She\u0027s twenty-three.\"\n \"Twenty-eight,\" I correct.\n \"Really?\" a concerned McDermott asks, after pausing.\n \"Yes\" I say. \"Really.\"\n Chapter Eighteen\n McDermott\u0027s left saying \"Oh.\"\n \"Shit, I just forgot,\" I say, slapping my hand to my forehead \"I invited Jeanette.\"\n \"Now that is one babe I would not mind, ahem, inviting,\" Van Patten says lewdly.\n \"Why does a nice young babe like Jeanette put up with you?\" McDermott asks. \"Why does she put up with you, Bateman?\"\n \"I keep her in cashmere. A great deal of cashmere,\" I murmur, and then, \"I\u0027ve got to call her and tell her not to come.\"\n \"Aren\u0027t you forgetting something?\" McDermott asks me.\n \"What?\" I\u0027m lost in thought.\n \"Is, like, Evelyn still on the other line?\"\n \"Oh shit,\" I exclaim. \"Hold on.\"\n \"Why am I even bothering with this?\" I hear McDermott ask himself, sighing.\n \"Bring Evelyn,\" Van Patten cries out. \"She\u0027s a babe too! Tell her to meet us at Zeus Bar at nine-thirty!\"\n \"Okay, okay,\" I shout before clicking back to the other line.\n \"I do not appreciate this, Patrick,\" Evelyn is saying.\n \"How about meeting us at Zeus Bar at nine-thirty?\" I suggest.\n \"Can I bring Stash and Vanden?\" she asks coyly.\n \"Is she the one with a tattoo?\" I ask back, coyly.\n \"No,\" she sighs. \"No tattoo.\"\n \"Bypass, bypass.\"\n \"Oh Pat rick,\" she whines.\n \"Look, you were lucky you were even invited, so just...\" My voice trails off.\n Silence, during which I don\u0027t feel bad.\n \"Come on, just meet us there,\" I say. \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\n \"Oh all right,\" she says, resigned. \"Nine-thirty?\"\n I click back onto the other line, interrupting Van Patter and McDermott\u0027s conversation about whether it\u0027s proper or not to wear a blue suit as one would a navy blazer.\n \"Hello?\" I interrupt. \"Shut up. Does everyone have my undivided attention?\"\n \"Yes, yes, yes,\" Van Patter sighs, bored.\n \"I am calling Cindy up to get Evelyn out of coming to dinner with us,\" I announce.\n \"Why in the hell did you invite Evelyn in the first place?\" one of them asks.\n \"We were joking, you idiot,\" the other adds. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-136.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: \n Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
