{"id":96565,"no":106,"title":"Page 106","content":"\"Remember this?\" I shout, towering over her. \"And look at this!\" I scream triumphantly, holding up a cigar. \"I still smoke cigars. Ha. See? A cigar.\" I light it with steady, bloodstained fingers, and her face, pale to the point of blueness, keeps contracting, twitching with pain, her eyes, dull with horror, close, then open halfway, her life reduced to nightmare.\n \"And another thing,\" I yell, pacing. \"It\u0027s not Carrick Anderson either. The suit is by Armani! Giorgio Armani.\" I pause spitefully and, leaning into her, sneer, \"And you thought it was Henry Stuart. Jesus.\" I slap her hard across the face and hiss the words \"Dumb bitch,\" spraying her face with spit, but it\u0027s covered with so much Mace that she probably can\u0027t even feel it, so I Mace her again and then I try to f**k her in the mouth once more but I can\u0027t come so I stop.\n Chapter Fifteen\n Thursday\n Later, the next night in fact, three of us, Craig McDermott, Courtney and myself, are in a cab heading toward Nell\u0027s and talking about Evian water. Courtney, in an Armani mink, has just admitted, giggling, that she uses Evian for ice cubes, which sparks a conversation about the differences in bottled water, and at Courtney\u0027s request we each try to list as many brands as we can.\n Courtney starts, counting each name off on one of her fingers. \"Well, there\u0027s Sparcal, Perrier, San Pellegrino, Poland Spring, Calistoga...\" She stops, stuck, and looks over at McDermott for help.\n He sighs, then lists, \"Canadian Spring, Canadian Calm, Montclair, which is also from Canada, Vittel from France, Crodo, which is Italian...\" He stops and rubs his chin thoughtfully, thinking of one more, then announces it as if surprised. \"Elan.\" And though it seems he\u0027s on the verge of naming another one, Craig lapses into an unilluminating silence.\n \"Elan?\" Courtney asks.\n \"It\u0027s from Switzerland,\" he says.\n \"Oh,\" she says, then turns to me. \"It\u0027s your turn, Patrick.\"\n Staring out the window of the cab, lost in thought, the silence I\u0027m causing filling me with a nameless dread, numbly, by rote, I list the following. \"You forgot Alpenwasser, Down Under, Schat, which is from Lebanon, Qubol and Cold Springs - \"\n \"I said that one already,\" Courtney cuts in, accusingly.\n \"No,\" I say. \"You said Poland Spring.\"\n \"Is that right?\" Courtney murmurs, then tugging at McDermott\u0027s overcoat, \"Is he right, Craig?\"\n \"Probably.\" McDermott shrugs. \"I guess.\"\n \"You must also remember that one should always buy mineral water in glass bottles. You shouldn\u0027t buy it in plastic ones,\" I say ominously, then wait for one of them to ask me why.\n \"Why?\" Courtney\u0027s voice is tinged with actual interest.\n \"Because it oxidizes,\" I explain. \"You want it to be crisp, with no aftertaste..\"\n After a long, confused, Courtney-like pause, McDermott admits, staring out the window, \"He\u0027s right.\"\n \"I really don\u0027t understand the differences in water,\" Courtney murmurs. She\u0027s sitting between McDermott and myself in the back of the cab and under the mink has on a wool twill suit by Givenchy, tights by Calvin Klein and shoes by Warren Susan Allen Edmonds. Earlier, in this same cab, when I touched the mink suggestively, with no intent other than to check its quality and she could sense this, Courtney quietly asked me if I had a breath mint. I said nothing.\n \"What do you mean?\" McDermott inquires solemnly:\n \"Well,\" she says, \"I mean what\u0027s really the difference between something like spring water and natural water, for instance, or, I mean, is there one?\"\n \"Courtney. Natural water is any water from an underground source,\" Craig sighs, still staring out the window. \"Mineral content hasn\u0027t been changed, although the water may have been disinfected or filtered.\" McDermott is wearing a wool tuxedo with notched lapels by Cianni Versace, and he reeks of Xeryus.\n I momentarily break out of my conscious inertia to explain further: \"And in spring water, minerals may have been added or removed and it\u0027s usually filtered, not processed.\" I pause. \"Seventy-five percent of all bottled water in America is actually spring water.\" I pause again, then ask the cab, \"Did anyone know that?\"\n A long, soulless pause follows and then Courtney asks another question, this one only half finished. \"The differences between distilled and purified water is...?\"\n I\u0027m not really listening to any of this conversation, not even to myself, because I\u0027m thinking of ways to get rid of Bethany\u0027s body, or at least debating whether or not I should keep it in my apartment another day or so. If I decide to get rid of it tonight, I can easily stuff what\u0027s left of her into a Hefty garbage bag and leave it in the stairwell; or I can exert the extra effort and drag it into the street, leaving it with the rest of the trash on the curb. I could even take it to the apartment in Hell\u0027s Kitchen and pour lime over it, smoke a cigar and watch it dissolve while listening to my Walkman, but I want to keep the men\u0027s bodies separate from the women\u0027s, and besides, I also want to watch Bloodhungry, the videotape I rented this afternoon - its ad line reads, \"Some clowns make you laugh, but Bobo will make you die and then he\u0027ll eat your body\" - and a midnight trip to Hell\u0027s Kitchen, even without a stop at Bellvue\u0027s for a small bite to eat, wouldn\u0027t give me enough time. Bethany\u0027s bones and most of her intestines and flesh will probably get dumped into the incinerator down the hall from my apartment. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-106.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: \n Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
