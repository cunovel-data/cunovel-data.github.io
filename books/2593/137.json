She answers after screening the call.\\n\\n \"Hello, Patrick,\" she says.\\n\\n \"Cindy,\" I say. \"I need a favor.\"\\n\\n \"Hamlin\u0027s not coming to dinner with you guys,\" she says. \"He tried calling back but your lines were all busy. Don\u0027t you guys have call waiting?\"\\n\\n \"Of course we have call waiting,\" I say. \"What do you think we are, barbarians?\"\\n\\n \"Hamlin\u0027s not coming,\" she says again, flatly.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s he doing instead?\" I ask. \"Oiling his Top-Siders?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s going out with me, Mr. Bateman.\"\\n\\n \"But what about your, uh, bush benefit?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"Hamlin got it mixed up,\" she says.\\n\\n \"Pumpkin,\" I start.\\n\\n \"Yes?\" she asks.\\n\\n \"Pumpkin, you\u0027re dating an ass**le,\" I say sweetly.\\n\\n \"Thanks, Patrick. That\u0027s nice.\"\\n\\n \"Pumpkin,\" I warn, \"you\u0027re dating the biggest dickweed in New York.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re telling me like I don\u0027t know this.\" She yawns.\\n\\n \"Pumpkin, you\u0027re dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.\"\\n\\n \"Do you know that Hamlin owns six television sets and seven VCRs?\"\\n\\n \"Does he ever use that rowing machine I got him?\" I actually wonder.\\n\\n \"Unused,\" she says. \"Totally unused.\"\\n\\n \"Pumpkin, he\u0027s a dickweed.\"\\n\\n \"Will you stop calling me pumpkin,\" she asks, annoyed.\\n\\n \"Listen, Cindy, if you had a choice to read WWD or...\" I stop, unsure of what I was going to say. \"Listen, is there anything going on tonight?\" I ask. \"Something not too... boisterous?\"\\n\\n \"What do you want, Patrick?\" she sighs.\\n\\n \"I just want peace, love, friendship, understanding,\" I say dispassionately.\\n\\n \"What-do-you-want?\" she repeats.\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t the two of you come with us?\"\\n\\n \"We have other plans.\"\\n\\n \"Hamlin made the goddamn reservations,\" I cry, outraged.\\n\\n \"Well,you guys use them.\"\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you come?\" I ask lasciviously. \"Dump dickweed off at Juanita\u0027s or something.\"\\n\\n \"I think I\u0027m passing on dinner,\" she says. \"Apologize to \u0027the guys\u0027 for me.\"\\n\\n \"But we\u0027re going to Kaktus, uh, I mean Zeus Bar,\" I say, then, confused, add, \"No, Kaktus.\"\\n\\n \"Are you guys really going there? \" she asks.\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Conventional wisdom has it that it is no longer the \u0027in\u0027 place to dine,\" she says.\\n\\n \"But Hamlin made the f**king reservation!\" I cry out.\\n\\n \"Did he make reservations there? \" she asks, bemused.\\n\\n \"Centuries ago!\" I shout.\\n\\n \"Listen,\" she says, \"I\u0027m getting dressed.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not at all happy about this,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry,\" she says, and then hangs up.\\n\\n I get back on the other line.\\n\\n \"Bateman, I know this sounds like an impossibility,\" McDermott says. \"But the void is actually widening.\"\\n\\n \"I am not into Mexican,\" Van Patten states.\\n\\n \"But wait, we\u0027re not having Mexican, are we?\" I say. \"Am I confused? Aren\u0027t we going to Zeus Bar?\"\\n\\n \"No, moron,\" McDermott spits. \"We couldn\u0027t get into Zeus Bar. Kaktus. Kaktus at nine.\"\\n\\n \"But I don\u0027t want Mexican,\" Van Patten says.\\n\\n \"But you, Van Patten, made the reservation,\" McDermott hollers.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t either,\" I say suddenly. \"Why Mexican?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not Mexican Mexican,\" McDermott says, exasperated \"It\u0027s something called nouvelle Mexicana, tapas or some other south of the border thing. Something like that. Hold on. My call waiting.\"\\n\\n He clicks off, leaving Van Patten and myself on the line.\\n\\n \"Bateman,\" Van Patten sighs, \"my euphoria is quickly subsiding.\"\\n\\n \"What are you talking about?\" I\u0027m actually trying to remember where I told Jeanette and Evelyn to meet us.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s change the reservation,\" he suggests.\\n\\n I think about it, then suspiciously ask, \"Where to?\"\\n\\n \"1969, \" he says, tempting me. \"Hmmm? 1969?\"\\n\\n \"I would like to go there,\" I admit.\\n\\n \"What should we do?\" he asks.\\n\\n I think about it. \"Make a reservation. Quick.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-137.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
