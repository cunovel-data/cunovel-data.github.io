{"id":96619,"no":160,"title":"Page 160","content":"\"Listen, Patrick. We need to talk about something;\" she says. \"Or at least I need to talk about something.\"\\n\\n ...where there was nature and earth, life and water, I saw a desert landscape that was unending, resembling some sort of crater, so devoid of reason and light and spirit that the mind could not grasp it on any sort of conscious level and if you came close the mind would reel backward, unable to take it in. It was a vision so clear and real and vital to me that in its purity it was almost abstract. This was what I could understand, this was how I lived my life, what I constructed my movement around, how I dealt with the tangible. This was the geography around which my reality revolved: it did not occur to me, ever, that people were good or that a man was capable of change or that the world could be a better place through one\u0027s taking pleasure in a feeling or a look or a gesture, of receiving another person\u0027s love or kindness. Nothing was affirmative, the term \"generosity of spirit\" applied to nothing, was a cliche, was some kind of bad joke. Sex is mathematics. Individuality no longer an issue. What does intelligence signify? Define reason. Desire - meaningless. Intellect is not a cure. Justice is dead. Fear, recrimination, innocence, sympathy, guilt, waste, failure, grief, were things, emotions, that no one really felt anymore. Reflection is useless, the world is senseless. Evil is its only permanence. God is not alive. Love cannot be trusted. Surface, surface, surface was all that anyone found meaning in... this was civilization as I saw it, colossal and jagged...\\n\\n \"...and I don\u0027t remember who it was you were talking to... it doesn\u0027t matter. What does is that you were very forceful, yet... very sweet and, I guess, I knew then that...\" She places her spoon down, but I\u0027m not watching her. I\u0027m looking out at the taxis moving up Broadway, yet they can\u0027t stop things from unraveling, because Jean says the following: \"A lot of people seem to have...\" She stops, continues hesitantly, \"lost touch with life and I don\u0027t want to be among them.\" After the waiter clears her dish, she adds, \"I don\u0027t want to get... bruised.\"\\n\\n I think I\u0027m nodding.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve learned what it\u0027s like to be alone and... I think I\u0027m in love with you.\" She says this last part quickly, forcing it out.\\n\\n Almost superstitiously, I turn toward her, sipping an Evian water, then, without thinking, say, smiling, \"I love someone else.\"\\n\\n As if this film had speeded up she laughs immediately, looks quickly away, down, embarrassed. \"I\u0027m, well, sorry... gosh.\"\\n\\n \"But...\" I add quietly, \"you shouldn\u0027t be... afraid.\"\\n\\n She looks back up at me, swollen with hope.\\n\\n \"Something can be done about it,\" I say. Then, not knowing why I\u0027d said that, I modify the statement, telling her straight on,\"Maybe something can\u0027t. I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve thrown away a lot of time to be with you, so it\u0027s not like I don\u0027t care.\"\\n\\n She nods mutely.\\n\\n \"You should never mistake affection for... passion,\" I warn her. \"It can be... not good. It can.... get you into, well, trouble.\"\\n\\n She\u0027s not saying anything and I can suddenly sense her sadness, flat and calm, like a daydream. \"What are you trying to say?\" she asks lamely, blushing.\\n\\n \"Nothing. I\u0027m just... letting you know that... appearances can be deceiving.\"\\n\\n She stares at the Times stacked in heavy folds on the table. A breeze barely causes it to flutter. \"Why... are you telling me this?\"\\n\\n Tactfully, almost touching her hand but stopping myself, I tell her, \"I just want to avoid any future misconnections.\" A hardbody walks by. I notice her, then look back at Jean. \"Oh come on, don\u0027t look that way. You have nothing to be ashamed of.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not,\" she says, trying to act casual. \"I just want to know if you\u0027re disappointed in me for admitting this.\"\\n\\n How could she ever understand that there isn\u0027t any way I could be disappointed since I no longer find anything worth looking forward to?\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know much about me, do you?\" I ask teasingly.\\n\\n \"I know enough,\" she says, her initial response, but then she shakes her head. \"Oh let\u0027s just drop this. I made a mistake. I\u0027m sorry.\" In the next instant she changes her mind. \"I want to know more,\" she says, gravely.\\n\\n I consider this before asking, \"Are you sure?\"\\n\\n \"Patrick,\" she says breathlessly, \"I know my life would be... much emptier without you... in it.\"\\n\\n I consider this too, nodding thoughtfully.\\n\\n \"And I just can\u0027t...\" She stops, frustrated. \"I can\u0027t pretend these feelings don\u0027t exist, can I?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-160.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
