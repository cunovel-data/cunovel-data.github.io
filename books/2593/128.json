{"id":96587,"no":128,"title":"Page 128","content":"When the mother finally notices him she doesn\u0027t scream because she can see only his feet and assumes that he\u0027s playfully hiding from her. At first she seems relieved that she\u0027s spotted him and moving toward the trash can she coos, \"Are you playing hide-and-seek, honey?\" But from where I stand, behind the pretty girl, who I\u0027ve already found out is foreign, a tourist, I can see the exact moment when the expression on the mother\u0027s face changes into fear, and slinging her purse over her shoulder she pulls the trash can away, revealing a face completely covered in red blood and the child\u0027s having trouble blinking its eyes because of this, grabbing at his throat, now kicking weakly. The mother makes a sound that I cannot describe - something high-pitched that turns into screaming. After she falls to the floor beside the body, a few people turning around, I find myself shouting out, my voice heavy with emotion, \"I\u0027m a doctor, move back, I\u0027m a doctor,\" and I kneel beside the mother before an interested crowd gathers around us and I pry her arms off the child, who is now on his back struggling vainly for breath, the blood coming evenly but in dying arcs out of his neck and onto his Polo shirt, which is drenched with it. And I have a vague awareness during the minutes I hold the child\u0027s head, reverently, careful not to bloody myself, that if someone makes a phone call or if a real doctor is at hand, there\u0027s a good chance the child can be saved. But this doesn\u0027t happen. Instead I hold it, mindlessly, while the mother - homely, Jewish-looking, overweight, pitifully trying to appear stylish in designer jeans and an unsightly leaf-patterned black wool sweater - shrieks do something, do something, do something, the two of us ignoring the chaos, the people who start screaming around us, concentrating only on the dying child. Though I am satisfied at first by my actions, I\u0027m suddenly jolted with a mournful despair at how useless, how extraordinarily painless, it is to take a child\u0027s life. This thing before me, small and twisted and bloody, has no real history, no worthwhile past, nothing is really lost. It\u0027s so much worse (and more pleasurable) taking the life of someone who has hit his or her prime, who has the beginnings of a full history, a spouse, a network of friends, a career, whose death will upset far more people whose capacity for grief is limitless than a child\u0027s would, perhaps ruin many more lives than just the meaningless, puny death of this boy. I\u0027m automatically seized with an almost overwhelming desire to knife the boy\u0027s mother too, who is in hysterics, but all I can do is slap her face harshly and shout for her to calm down. For this I\u0027m given no disapproving looks. I\u0027m dimly aware of light coming into the room, of a door being opened somewhere, of the presence of zoo officials, a security guard, someone - one of the tourists? - taking flash pictures, the penguins freaking out in the tank behind us, slamming themselves against the glass in a panic. A cop pushes me away, even though I tell him I\u0027m a physician. Someone drags the boy outside, lays him on the ground and removes his shirt. The boy gasps, dies. The mother has to be restrained. I feel empty, hardly here at all, but even the arrival of the police seems an insufficient reason to move and I stand with the crowd outside the penguin habitat, with dozens of others, taking a long time to slowly blend in and then back away, until finally I\u0027m walking down Fifth Avenue, surprised by how little blood has stained my jacket, and I stop in a bookstore and buy a book and then at a Dove Bar stand on the corner of Fifty-sixth Street, where I buy a Dove Bar - a coconut one - and I imagine a hole, widening in the sun, and for some reason this breaks the tension I started feeling when I first noticed the snowy owl\u0027s eyes and then when it recurred after the boy was dragged out of the penguin habitat and I walked away, my hands soaked with blood, uncaught. Girls My appearances in the office the last month or so have been sporadic to say the least. All I seem to want to do now is work out, lifting weights, mostly, and secure reservations at new restaurants I\u0027ve already been to, then cancel them. My apartment reeks of rotten fruit, though actually the smell is caused by what I scooped out of Christie\u0027s head and poured into a Marco glass bowl that sits on a counter near the entranceway. The head itself lies covered with brain pulp, hollow and eyeless, in the corner of the living room beneath the piano and I plan to use it as a jack-o\u0027-lantern on Halloween. Because of the stench I decide to use Paul Owen\u0027s apartment for a little tryst I have planned for tonight. I\u0027ve had the premises scanned for surveillance devices; disappointingly, there were none. Someone I talk to through my lawyer tells me that Donald Kimball, the private investigator, has heard that Owen really is in London, that someone spotted him twice in the lobby of Claridge\u0027s, once each at a tailor on Savile Row and at a trendy new restaurant in Chelsea. Kimball flew over two nights ago, which means no one is keeping watch over the apartment anymore, and the keys I stole from Owen still function so I was able to bring the tools (a power drill, a bottle of acid, the nail gun, knives, a Bic lighter) over there after lunch. I hire two escort girls from a reputable if somewhat sleazy private establishment I\u0027ve never used before, charging them on Owen\u0027s gold American Express card which, I suppose because everyone thinks Owen is now in London, no one has put a trace on, though there is one on his platinum AmEx. The Patty Winters Show today was - ironically, I thought - about Princess Di\u0027s beauty tips.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-128.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
