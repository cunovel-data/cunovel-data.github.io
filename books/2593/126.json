I tell Luis, \"Leave me alone, please,\" and I start to walk away.\n Unable to grasp this request, Luis grabs at the hem of my Armani silk-cloth trench coat and, still lying on the floor, cries out, \"Please, Patrick,please don\u0027t leave me.\"\n \"Listen to me,\" I tell him, kneeling down, trying to haul Luis up off the floor. But this causes him to shout out something garbled, which turns into a wail that rises and reaches a crescendo that catches the attention of a Barney\u0027s security guard standing by the store\u0027s front entrance, who starts making his way over.\n \"Look what you\u0027ve done,\" I whisper desperately. \"Get up. Get up.\"\n \"Is everything okay?\" The security guard, a big black guy, is looking down at us.\n \"Yes, thank you,\" I say, glaring at Luis. \"Everything\u0027s fine.\"\n \"No-o-o-o,\" Luis wails, racked with sobs.\n \"Yes,\" I reiterate, looking up at the guard.\n \"You sure?\" the guard asks.\n Smiling professionally, I tell him, \"Please just give us a minute. We need some privacy.\" I turn back to Luis. \"Now come on, Luis. Get up. You\u0027re slobbering.\" I look back up at the security guard and mouth, holding up a hand, while nodding, \"Just a minute, please.\"\n The security guard nods unsurely and moves hesitantly back to his post.\n Still kneeling, I grab Luis by his heaving shoulders and calmly tell him, my voice lowered, as threatening as possible, as if speaking to a child about to be punished, \"Listen to me, Luis. If you do not stop crying, you f**king pathetic faggot, I am going to slit your f**king throat. Are you listening to me?\" I slap him lightly on the face a couple of times. \"I can\u0027t be more emphatic.\"\n \"Oh just kill me,\" he wails, his eyes closed, nodding his head back and forth, retreating further into incoherence; then he blubbers, \"If I can\u0027t have you, I don\u0027t want to live. I want to die.\"\n My sanity is in danger of fading, right here in Barney\u0027s, and I grab Luis by the collar, scrunching it up in my fist, and pulling his face very close to mine, I whisper, under my breath, \"Listen to me, Luis. Are you listening to me? I usually don\u0027t warn people, Luis. So-be-thankful-I-am-warning-you.\"\n His rationality shot to hell, making guttural noises, his head bent down shamefully, he offers a response that\u0027s barely audible. I grab his hair - it\u0027s stiff with mousse; I recognize the scent as Cactus, a new brand - and yanking his head up, snarling, I spit out, \"Listen, you want to die? I\u0027ll do it, Luis. I\u0027ve done it before and I will f**king gut you, rip your f**king stomach open and cram your intestines down your f**king faggot throat until you choke on them.\"\n He\u0027s not listening. Still on my haunches, I just stare at him in disbelief.\n \"Please, Patrick, please. Listen to me, I\u0027ve figured it all out. I\u0027m quitting P \u0026 P, you can too, and, and, and we\u0027ll relocate to Arizona, and then - \"\n \"Shut up, Luis.\" I shake him. \"Oh my god, just shut up.\" I quickly stand, brushing myself off, and when I think his outburst has subsided and I\u0027m able to walk away, Luis grabs at my right ankle and tries to hang on as I\u0027m leaving Barney\u0027s and I end up dragging him along for six feet before I have to kick him in the face, while smiling helplessly at a couple who are browsing near the sock department. Luis looks up at me, imploring, the beginnings of a small gash forming on his left cheek. The couple move away.\n \"I love you,\" he miserably wails. \"I love you.\"\n \"I\u0027m convinced, Luis,\" I shout at him. \"You\u0027ve convinced me. Now get up.\"\n Luckily, a salesperson, alarmed by the scene Luis has made, intervenes and helps him up.\n A few minutes later, after he\u0027s sufficiently calmed down, the two of us are standing just inside Barney\u0027s main entrance. He has a handkerchief in one hand, his eyes are shut tightly, a bruise slowly forms, swelling beneath his left eye. He seems composed.\n \"Just, you know, have the guts to face, uh, reality,\" I tell him.\n Anguished, he stares out the revolving doors at the warm falling rain and then, with a mournful sigh, turns to me. I\u0027m looking at the rows, the endless rows, of ties, then at the ceiling. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-126.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: \n Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
