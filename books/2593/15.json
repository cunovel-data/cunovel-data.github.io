And by the way, Preston, you simply have a tab with a buttonhole sewn into the front of the shirt, which can then be attached by a button to your trousers; and make sure that the stiff pleated front of the shirt doesn\u0027t extend below the waistband of your trousers or it will rise up when you sit down now is that jerk Reed Robison? It looks a hell uva lot like him.\"\n Stunned by Price\u0027s remarks, Preston slowly turns around, still on his haunches, and after he puts his glasses back on, squints over at the bar. \"No, that\u0027s Nigel Morrison.\"\n \"Ah,\" Price exclaims. \"One of those young British faggots serving internship at...?\"\n \"How do you know he\u0027s a faggot?\" I ask him.\n \"They\u0027re all faggots.\" Price shrugs. \"The British.\"\n \"How would you know, Timothy?\" Van Patten grins.\n \"I saw him f**k Bateman up the ass in the men\u0027s room at Morgan Stanley,\" Price says.\n I sigh and ask Preston, \"Where is Morrison interning?\"\n \"I forget,\" Preston says, scratching his head. \"Lazard?\"\n \"Where?\" McDermott presses. \"First Boston? Goldman?\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure,\" Preston says. \"Maybe Drexel? Listen, he\u0027s just an assistant corporate finance analyst and his ugly, blacktooth girlfriend is in some dinky rat hole doing leveraged buy outs.\"\n .\u0027Where are we eat ing?\" I ask, my patience at an all-time low. \"We need to make a reservation. I\u0027m not standing at some f**king bar.\"\n \"What in the f**k is Morrison wearing?\" Preston asks himself. \"Is that really a glen-plaid suit with a checkered shirt?\"\n \"That\u0027s not Morrison,\" Price says.\n \"Who is it then?\" Preston asks, taking his glasses off again.\n \"That\u0027s Paul Owen,\" Price says.\n \"That\u0027s not Paul Owen,\" I say. \"Paul Owen\u0027s on the other side of the bar. Over there.\"\n Owen stands at the bar wearing a double-breasted wool suit.\n \"He\u0027s handling the Fisher account,\" someone says.\n \"Lucky bastard,\" someone else murmurs.\n \"Lucky Jew bastard,\" Preston says.\n \"Oh Jesus, Preston,\" I say. \"What does that have to do with anything?\"\n \"Listen, I\u0027ve seen the bastard sitting in his office on the phone with CEOs, spinning a f**king menorah. The bastard brought a Hanukkah bush into the office last December,\" Preston says suddenly, peculiarly animated.\n \"You spin a dreidel, Preston,\" I say calmly, \"not a menorah. You spin a dreidel.\"\n \"Oh my god, Bateman, do you want me to go over to the bar and ask Freddy to fry you up some f**king potato pancakes?\" Preston asks, truly alarmed. \"Some... latkes?\"\n \"No,\" I say. \"Just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.\"\n \"The voice of reason.\" Price leans forward to pat me on the back. \"The boy next door.\"\n \"Yeah, a boy next door who according to you let a British corporate finance analyst intern sodomize him up the ass,\" I say ironically.\n \"I said you were the voice of reason,\" Price says. \"I didn\u0027t say you weren\u0027t a homosexual.\"\n \"Or redundant,\" Preston adds.\n \"Yeah,\" I say, staring directly at Price. \"Ask Meredith if I\u0027m a homosexual. That is, if she\u0027ll take the time to pull my dick out of her mouth.\"\n \"Meredith\u0027s a fag hag,\" Price explains, unfazed, \"that\u0027s why I\u0027m dumping her.\"\n \"Oh wait, guys, listen, I got a joke.\" Preston rubs his hands together.\n \"Preston,\" Price says, \"you are a joke. You do know you weren\u0027t invited to dinner. By the way, nice jacket; nonmatching but complementary.\"\n \"Price, you are a bastard, you are so f**king mean to me it hurts,\" Preston says, laughing. \"Anyway, so JFK and Pearl Bailey meet at this party and they go back to the Oval Office to have sex and so they f**k and then JFK goes to sleep and...\" Preston stops. \"Oh gosh, now what happens... Oh yeah, so Pearl Bailey says Mr. President I wanna f**k you again and so he says I\u0027m going to sleep now and in... thirty-no, wait...\" Preston pauses again, confused. \"Now... no, sixty minutes... no... okay, thirty minutes I\u0027ll wake up and we\u0027ll do it again but you\u0027ve got to keep one hand on my c**k and the other on my balls and she says okay but why do I have to keep one hand on your dick and one... one hand on your balls... and...\" He notices that Van Patten is idly doodling something on the back of a napkin. \"Hey Van Patten - are you listening to me?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-15.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: \n Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
