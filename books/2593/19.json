I am unexpectedly depressed that I started this.\n \"Pizza. Let\u0027s order a pizza,\" McDermott says. \"Doesn\u0027t anyone want to split a pizza? Red snapper? Mmmmm. Bateman wants that,\" he says, rubbing his hands eagerly together.\n I pick up Montgomery\u0027s card and actually finger it, for the sensation the card gives off to the pads of my fingers.\n \"Nice, huh?\" Price\u0027s tone suggests he realizes I\u0027m jealous.\n \"Yeah,\" I say offhandedly, giving Price the card like I don\u0027t give a shit, but I\u0027m finding it hard to swallow.\n \"Red snapper pizza,\" McDermott reminds me. \"I\u0027m f**king starving.\"\n \"No pizza,\" I murmur, relieved when Montgomery\u0027s card is placed away, out of sight, back in Timothy\u0027s pocket.\n \"Come on,\" McDermott says, whining. \"Let\u0027s order the red upper pizza.\"\n \"Shut up, Craig,\" Van Patten says, eyeing a waitress taking a booth\u0027s order. \"But call that hardbody over.\"\n \"But she\u0027s not ours,\" McDermott says, fidgeting with the menu he\u0027s yanked from a passing busboy.\n \"Call her over any way,\" Van Patten insists. \"Ask her for water or a Corona or something.\"\n \"Why her?\" I\u0027m asking no one in particular. My card lies on the table, ignored next to an orchid in a blue glass vase. Gently I pick it up and slip it, folded, back into my wallet.\n \"She looks exactly like this girl who works in the Georgette Klinger section of Bloomingdale\u0027s,\" Van Patten says. \"Call her over.\"\n \"Does anyone want the pizza or not?\" McDermott\u0027s getting testy.\n \"How would you know?\" I ask Van Patten.\n \"I buy Kate\u0027s perfume there,\" he answers.\n Price\u0027s gestures gather the table\u0027s attention. \"Did I forget to tell everyone that Montgomery\u0027s a dwarf?\"\n \"Who\u0027s Kate?\" I say.\n \"Kate is the chick who Van Patter\u0027s having the affair with,\" Price explains, staring back at Montgomery\u0027s table.\n \"What happened to Miss Kitt ridge?\" I ask.\n \"Yeah,\" Price smiles. \"What about Amanda?\"\n \"Oh god, guys, lighten up. Fidelity? Right.\"\n \"Aren\u0027t you afraid of diseases?\" Price asks.\n \"From who, Amanda or Kate?\" I ask.\n \"I thought we agreed that we can\u0027t get it.\" Van Patten\u0027s voice rises. \"So-o-o-o... shithead. Shut up.\"\n \"Didn\u0027t I tell you - \"\n Four more Bellinis arrive. There are now eight Bellinis on the table.\n \"Oh my god,\" Price moans, trying to grab at the busboy before he scampers off.\n \"Red snapper pizza... red snapper pizza...\" McDermott has found a mantra for the evening.\n \"We\u0027ll soon become targets for horny Iranian chicks,\" Price drones.\n \"It\u0027s like zero zero zero percentage whatever, you know - are you listening?\" Van Patten asks.\n \"...snapper pizza... red snapper pizza...\" Then McDermott slams his hand on the table, rocking it. \"Goddamnit, isn\u0027t anybody listening to me?\"\n I\u0027m still tranced out on Montgomery\u0027s card - the classy coloring, the thickness, the lettering, the print - and I suddenly raise a fist as if to strike out at Craig and scream, my voice booming, \"No one wants the f**king red snapper pizza! A pizza should be yeasty and slightly bready and have a cheesy crust! The crusts here are too f**king thin because the shithead chef who cooks here overbakes everything! The pizza is dried out and brittle!\" Red-faced, I slam my Bellini down on the table and when I look up our appetizers have arrived. A hardbody waitress stands looking down at me with this strange, glazed expression. I wipe a hand over my face, genially smiling up at her. She stands there looking at me as if I were some kind of monster - she actually looks scared - and I glance over at Price - for what? guidance? - and he mouths \"Cigars\" and pats his coat pocket.\n McDermott quietly says, \"I don\u0027t think they\u0027re brittle.\"\n \"Honey,\" I say, ignoring McDermott, taking an arm and pulling her toward me. She flinches but I smile and she lets me pull her closer. \"Now we\u0027re all going to eat a nice big meal here - \" I start to explain.\n \"But this isn\u0027t what I ordered,\" Van Patten says, looking at his plate. \"I wanted the mussel sausage.\"\n \"Shut up.\" I shoot him a glance then calmly turn toward the hardbody, grinning like an idiot, but a handsome idiot. \"Now listen, we are good customers here and we\u0027re probably going to order some fine brandy, cognac, who knows, and we want to relax and bask in this\" - I gesture with my arm - \"atmosphere. Now\" - with the other hand I pull out my gazelleskin wallet - \"we would like to enjoy some fine Cuban cigars afterwards and we don\u0027t want to be bothered by some lout ish - \" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-19.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: \n Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
