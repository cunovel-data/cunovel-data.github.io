Defend her.\"\n \"Why?\" the guy asks, then shrugs, both nostrils ringed with white powder. \"He\u0027s right.\"\n \"I\u0027m leaving, Daniel,\" the girl says, near tears. \"I can\u0027t handle this. I can\u0027t handle you. I can\u0027t handle them. I warned you at Bice.\"\n \"Go ahead,\" the guy says. \"Go. Just do it. Take a hike. I don\u0027t care.\"\n \"Patrick, what have you started?\" Evelyn asks, backing away from me. \"This is unacceptable,\" and then, looking up at the fluorescent bulbs, \"And so is this lighting. I\u0027m leaving.\" But she stands there, waiting.\n \"I\u0027m leaving, Daniel,\" the girl says. \"Did you hear me?\"\n \"Go ahead. Forget it,\" Daniel says, staring at his nose in the mirror, waving her away. \"I said take a hike.\"\n \"I\u0027m using the stall,\" I tell the room. \"Is this okay? Does anybody mind?\"\n \"Aren\u0027t you going to defend your girlfriend?\" Evelyn asks Daniel.\n \"Jesus, what do you want me to do?\" He looks at her in the mirror, wiping his nose, sniffing again. \"I bought her dinner. I introduced her to Richard Marx. Jesus Christ, what else does she want?\"\n \"Beat the shit out of him?\" the girl suggests, pointing at me.\n \"Oh honey,\" I say, shaking my head, \"the things I could do to you with a coat hanger.\"\n \"Goodbye, Daniel,\" she says, pausing dramatically. \"I\u0027m out of here.\"\n \"Good,\" Daniel says, holding up the vial. \"More for moi.\"\n \"And don\u0027t try calling me,\" she screams, opening the door. \"My answering machine is on tonight and I\u0027m screening all calls!\"\n \"Patrick,\" Evelyn says, still composed, prim. \"I\u0027ll be outside.\"\n I wait a moment, staring at her from inside the stall, then at the girl standing in the doorway. \"Yeah, so?\"\n \"Patrick,\" Evelyn says, \"don\u0027t say something you\u0027ll regret.\"\n \"Just go,\" I say. \"Just leave. Take the limo.\"\n \"Patrick - \"\n \"Leave,\" I roar. \"The Grinch says leave!\"\n I slam the door of the stall and start shoveling the coke from the envelope into my nose with my platinum AmEx. In between my gasps I hear Evelyn leave, sobbing to the girl, \"He made me walk out of my own Christmas party, can you believe it? My Christmas party?\" And I hear the girl sneer \"Get a life\" and I start laughing raucously, banging my head against the side of the stall, and then I hear the guy do a couple more hits, then he splits, and after finishing most of the gram I peek out from over the stall to see if Evelyn\u0027s still hanging around, pouting, chewing her lower lip sorrowfully - oh boo hoo hoo, baby - but she hasn\u0027t come back, and then I get an image of Evelyn and Daniel\u0027s girlfriend on a bed somewhere with the girl spreading Evelyn\u0027s legs, Evelyn on all fours, licking her ass**le, fingering her cunt, and this makes me dizzy and I head out of the rest room into the club, horny and desperate, lusting for contact.\n But it\u0027s later now and the crowd has changed - it\u0027s now filled with more punk rockers, blacks, fewer Wall Street guys, more bored rich girls from Avenue A lounging around, and the music has changed; instead of Belinda Carlisle singing \"I Feel Free\" it\u0027s some black guy rapping, if I\u0027m hearing this correctly, something called \"Her Shit on His Dick\" and I sidle up to a couple of hardbody rich girls, both of them wearing skanky Betsey Johnson-type dresses, and I\u0027m wired beyond belief and I start off with a line like \"Cool music - haven\u0027t I seen you at Salomon Brothers?\" and one of them, one of these girls, sneers and says, \"Go back to Wall Street,\" and the one with the nose ring says, \"Fucking yuppie.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-84.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: \n Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
