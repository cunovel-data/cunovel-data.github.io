It doesn\u0027t matter. The phone in my room didn\u0027t have two lines and there was no call waiting,\" she says. \"Where were you?\"\n \"I was... fooling around renting videotapes,\" I say, pleased, giving myself high-five, the cordless phone cradled in my neck.\n \"I wanted to come over,\" she says in a whiny, little-girl tone. \"I was scared. I still am. Can\u0027t you hear it in my voice?\"\n \"Actually, you sound like anything but.\"\n \"No, Patrick, seriously. I\u0027m quite terrified,\" she says. \"I\u0027m shaking. Just like a leaf I\u0027m shaking. Ask Mia, my facialist. She said I was tense.\"\n \"Well,\" I say, \"you couldn\u0027t have come over anyway.\"\n \"Honey, why not?\" she whines, and then addresses someone who just entered her suite. \"Oh wheel it over there near the window... no, that window... and can you tell me where that damn masseuse is?\"\n \"Because your neighbor\u0027s head was in my freezer.\" I yawn, stretching. \"Listen. Dinner? Where? Can you hear me?\"\n At eight-thirty, the two of us are sitting across from each other in Barcadia. Evelyn\u0027s wearing an Anne Klein rayon jacket, a wool-crepe skirt, a silk blouse from Bonwit\u0027s, antique gold and agate earrings from James Robinson that cost, roughly, four thousand dollars; and I\u0027m wearing a double-breasted suit, a silk shirt with woven stripes, a patterned silk tie and leather slip-ons, all by Gianni Versace. I neither canceled the reservation at Turtles nor told Courtney not to meet me there, so she\u0027ll probably show up around eight-fifteen, completely confused, and if she hasn\u0027t taken any Elavil today she\u0027ll probably be furious and it\u0027s this fact - not the bottle of Cristal that Evelyn insists on ordering and then adds cassis to - that I laugh out loud about.\n I spent most of the afternoon buying myself early Christmas presents - a large pair of scissors at a drugstore near City Hall, a letter opener from Hammacher Schlemmer, a cheese knife from Bloomingdale\u0027s to go along with the cheese board that Jean, my secretary who\u0027s in love with me, left on my desk before she went to lunch while I was in a meeting. The Patty Winters Show this morning was about the possibility of nuclear war, and according to the panel of experts the odds are pretty good it will happen sometime within the next month. Evelyn\u0027s face seems chalky to me right now, her mouth lined with a purple lipstick that gives off an almost startling effect, and I realize that she\u0027s belatedly taken Tim Price\u0027s advice to stop using her tanning lotion. Instead of mentioning this and have her bore me silly with inane denials, I ask about Tim\u0027s girlfriend, Meredith, whom Evelyn despises for reasons never made quite clear to me. And because of rumors about Courtney and myself, Courtney\u0027s also on Evelyn\u0027s shit list, for reasons that are a little clearer. I place a hand over the top of the champagne flute when the apprehensive waitress, at Evelyn\u0027s request, attempts to add some blueberry crisis into my Cristal.\n \"No thank you,\" I tell her. \"Maybe later. In a separate glass.\"\n \"Party pooper.\" Evelyn giggles, then takes a sharp breath. \"But you smell nice. What are you wearing - Obsession? You party pooper, is it Obsession?\"\n \"No,\" I say grimly. \"Paul Sebastian.\"\n \"Of course.\" She smiles, downs her second glass. She seems in a much better mood, boisterous almost, more than you\u0027d expect of someone whose neighbor\u0027s head was sliced off in a matter of seconds while she was still conscious by an electric mini-chain saw. Evelyn\u0027s eyes momentarily glitter in the candlelight, then revert to their normal pallid gray.\n \"How is Meredith?\" I ask, trying to mask my void of disinterest.\n \"Oh god She\u0027s dating Richard Cunningham.\" Evelyn moans. \"He\u0027s at First Boston. If you can believe it.\"\n \"You know,\" I mention, \"Tim was going to break it off with her. Call it quits.\"\n \"Why, for god\u0027s sake?\" Evelyn asks, surprised, intrigued. \"They had that fabulous place in the Hamptons.\"\n \"I remember him telling me that he was sick to death of watching her do nothing but her nails all weekend.\"\n \"Oh my god,\" Evelyn says, and then, genuinely confused, \"You mean... wait, she didn\u0027t have someone do them for her?\"\n \"Tim said, and he reiterated this fact quite often, that she had all the personality of a game-show host,\" I say dryly, sipping from the flute.\n She smiles to herself, secretly. \"Tim is a rascal.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-51.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: \n Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
