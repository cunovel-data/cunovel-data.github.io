{"id":96517,"no":58,"title":"Page 58","content":"Abacab (Atlantic; 1981) was released almost immediately after Duke and it benefits from a new producer, Hugh Padgham, who gives the band a more eighties sound and though the songs seem fairly generic, there are still great bits throughout: the extended jam in the middle of the title track and the horns by some group called Earth, Wind and Fire on \"No Reply at All\" are just two examples. Again the songs reflect dark emotions and are about people who feel lost or who are in conflict, but the production and sound are gleaming and upbeat (even if the titles aren\u0027t: \"No Reply at All,\" \"Keep It Dark,\" \"Who Dunnit?\" \"Like It or Not\"). Mike Rutherford\u0027s bass is obscured somewhat in the mix but otherwise the band sounds tight and is once again propelled by Collins\u0027 truly amazing drumming. Even at its most despairing (like the song \"Dodo,\" about extinction), Abacab musically is poppy and lighthearted.\\n\\n My favorite track is \"Man on the Corner,\" which is the only song credited solely to Collins, a moving ballad with a pretty synthesized melody plus a riveting drum machine in the background. Though it could easily come off any of Phil\u0027s solo albums, because the themes of loneliness, paranoia and alienation are overly familiar to Genesis it evokes the band\u0027s hopeful humanism. \"Man on the Corner\" profoundly equates a relationship with a solitary figure (a bum, perhaps a poor homeless person?), \"that lonely man on the corner\" who just stands around. \"Who Dunnit?\" profoundly expresses the theme of confusion against a funky groove, and what makes this song so exciting is that it ends with its narrator never finding anything out at all.\\n\\n Hugh Padgham produced next an even less conceptual effort, simply called Genesis (Atlantic; 1983), and though it\u0027s a fine album a lot of it now seems too derivative for my tastes. \u0027That\u0027s All\" sounds like \"Misunderstanding,\" \"Taking It All Too Hard\" reminds me of \"Throwing It All Away.\" It also seems less jazzy than its predecessors and more of an eighties pop album, more rock \u0027n\u0027 roll. Padgham does a brilliant job of producing, but the material is weaker than usual and you can sense the strain. It opens with the autobiographical \"Mama,\" that\u0027s both strange and touching, though I couldn\u0027t tell if the singer was talking about his actual mother or to a girl he likes to call \"Mama.\" \u0027That\u0027s All\" is a lover\u0027s lament about being ignored and beaten down by an unreceptive partner; despite the despairing tone it\u0027s got a bright sing-along melody that makes the song less depressing than it probably needed to be. \"That\u0027s All\" is the best tune on the album, but Phil\u0027s voice is strongest on \"House by the Sea,\" whose lyrics are, however, too stream-of-consciousness to make much sense. It might be about growing up and accepting adulthood but it\u0027s unclear; at any rate, its second instrumental part puts the song more in focus for me and Mike Banks gets to show off his virtuosic guitar skills while Tom Rutherford washes the tracks over with dreamy synthesizers, and when Phil repeats the song\u0027s third verse at the end it can give you chills.\\n\\n \"Illegal Alien\" is the most explicitly political song the group has yet recorded and their funniest. The subject is supposed to be sad - a wetback trying to get across the border into the United States - but the details are highly comical: the bottle of tequila the Mexican holds, the new pair of shoes he\u0027s wearing (probably stolen); and it all seems totally accurate. Phil sings it in a brash, whiny pseudo-Mexican voice that makes it even funnier, and the rhyme of \"fun \" with \"illegal alien \" is inspired. \"Just a Job to Do\" is the album\u0027s funkiest song, with a killer bass line by Banks, and though it seems to be about a detective chasing a criminal, I think it could also be about a jealous lover tracking someone down. \"Silver Rainbow\" is the album\u0027s most lyrical song. The words are intense, complex and gorgeous. The album ends on a positive, upbeat note with \"It\u0027s Gonna Get Better.\" Even if the lyrics seem a tiny bit generic to some, Phil\u0027s voice is so confident (heavily influenced by Peter Gabriel, who never made an album this polished and heartfelt himself) that he makes us believe in glorious possibilities.\\n\\n Invisible Touch (Atlantic; 1986) is the group\u0027s undisputed masterpiece. It\u0027s an epic meditation on intangibility, at the same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. It has a resonance that keeps coming back at the listener, and the music is so beautiful that it\u0027s almost impossible to shake off because every song makes some connection about the unknown or the spaces between people (\"Invisible Touch\"), questioning authoritative control whether by domineering lovers or by government (\"Land of Confusion\") or by meaningless repetition (\"Tonight Tonight Tonight\u0027. All in all it ranks with the finest rock \u0027n\u0027 roll achievements of the decade and the mastermind behind this album, along of course with the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford, is Hugh Padgham, who has never found as clear and crisp and modern a sound as this. You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-58.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
