Beautiful.\"\n \"Very civilized.\" Goodrich nods.\n Superstylish English guy Nigel Morrison stops by our table and he\u0027s wearing a flower in the lapel of his Paul Smith jacket. But he can\u0027t stay long since he has to meet other British friends, Ian and Lucy, at Delmonico\u0027s. Seconds after he walks away, I hear someone sneer, \"Nigel. A pate animal.\"\n Someone else: \"Did you know that caveman got more fiber than we do?\"\n \"Who\u0027s handling the Fisher account?\"\n \"Screw that. What about the Shepard thing? The Shepard account?\"\n \" Is that David Monrowe? What a burnout.\"\n \"Oh brother.\"\n \"For Christ sakes.\"\n \"...lean and mean...\"\n \"What\u0027s in it for me?\"\n \"The Shepard play or the Shepard account?\"\n \"Rich people with cheap stereos.\"\n \"No, girls who can hold their liquor.\"\n \"...total lightweight...\"\n \"Need a light?
