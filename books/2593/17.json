Look who just came in.\" Van Patten whistles. \"Oh boy.\"\n \"Oh for Christ sakes, not f**king Preston,\" Price sighs.\n \"No. Oh no,\" Van Patten says ominously. \"He hasn\u0027t spotted us yet.\"\n \"Victor Powell? Paul Owen?\" I say, suddenly scared.\n \"He\u0027s twenty-four and worth, oh, let\u0027s say, a repulsive amount of dough,\" Van Patten hints, grinning. He has obviously been spotted by the person and flashes a bright, toothy smile. \"A veritable shit load.\"\n I crane my neck but can\u0027t figure out who\u0027s doing anything.\n \"It\u0027s Scott Montgomery,\" Price says. \"Isn\u0027t it? It\u0027s Scott Montgomery.\"\n \"Perhaps,\" Van Patten teases.\n \"It\u0027s that dwarf Scott Montgomery,\" says Price.\n \"Price,\" Van Patten says. \"You\u0027re priceless.\"\n \"Watch me act thrilled,\" Price says, turning around. \"Well, as thrilled as I can get meeting someone from Georgia.\"\n \"Whoa,\" McDermott says. \"And he\u0027s dressed to impress.\"\n \"Hey,\" Price says. \"I\u0027m depressed, I mean impressed.\"\n \"Wow,\" I say, spotting Montgomery. \"Elegant navies.\"\n \"Subtle plaids,\" Van Patten whispers.\n \"Lotsa beige,\" Price says. \"You know.\"\n \"Here he comes,\" I say, bracing myself.\n Scott Montgomery walks over to our booth wearing a double-breasted navy blue blazer with mock-tortoiseshell buttons, a prewashed wrinkled-cotton striped dress shirt with red accent stitching, a red, white and blue fireworks-print silk tie by Hugo Boss and plum washed-wool trousers with a quadruple-pleated front and slashed pockets by Lazo. He\u0027s holding a glass of champagne and hands it to the girl he\u0027s with - definite model type, thin, okay tits, no ass, high heels - and she\u0027s wearing a wool-crepe skirt and a wool and cashmere velour jacket and draped over her arm is a wool and cashmere velour coat, all by Louis Dell\u0027OliO. High-heeled shoes by Susan Bennis Warren Edwards. Sunglasses by Alain Mikli. Pressed-leather bag from Hermes.\n \"Hey fellas. How y\u0027all doin?\" Montgomery speaks in a thick Georgia twang. \"This is Nicki. Nicki, this is McDonald, Van Buren, Bateman - nice tan - and Mr. Price.\" He shakes only Timothy\u0027s hand and then takes the champagne glass from Nicki. Nicki smiles, politely, like a robot, probably doesn\u0027t speak English.\n \"Montgomery,\" Price says in a kindly, conversational tone, staring at Nicki. \"How have things been?\"\n \"Well, fellas,\" Montgomery says. \"See y\u0027all got the primo table. Get the check yet? Just kidding.\"\n \"Listen, Montgomery,\" Price says, staring at Nicki but still being unusually kind to someone I thought was a stranger. \"Squash?\"\n \"Call me,\" Montgomery says absently, looking over the room. \"Is that Tyson? Here\u0027s my card.\"\n \"Great,\" Price says, pocketing it. \"Thursday?\"\n \"Can\u0027t. Going to Dallas tomorrow but...\" Montgomery is already moving away from the table, hurrying toward someone else, snapping for Nicki. \"Yeah, next week.\"\n Nicki smiles at me, then looks at the floor - pink, blue, lime green tiles crisscrossing each other in triangular patterns - as if it had some kind of answer, held some sort of clue, offered a coherent reason as to why she was stuck with Montgomery. Idly I wonder if she\u0027s older than him, and then if she\u0027s flirting with me.\n \"Later,\" Price is saying.\n \"Later, fellas...\" Montgomery is already about halfway across the room. Nicki slinks behind him. I was wrong: she does have an ass.\n \"Eight hundred million.\" McDermott whistles, shaking his head.\n \"College?\" I ask.\n \"A joke,\" Price hints. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-17.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: \n Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
