{"id":96492,"no":33,"title":"Page 33","content":"She arrives thirty minutes late and I tell the doorman to let her up even though I meet her outside my door while I\u0027m locking it. She isn\u0027t wearing the Karl Lagerfeld suit I expected, but she looks pretty decent anyway: a silk gazar blouse with rhinestone cuff links by Louis Dell\u0027Olio and a pair of embroidered velvet pants from Saks, crystal earrings by Wendy Gell for Anne Klein and gold sling-back pumps. I wait until we\u0027re in the cab heading midtown to tell her about not going to Dorsia and then I apologize profusely, mention something about disconnected phone lines, a fire, a vengeful maitre d\u0027. She gives a little gasp when I drop the news, ignores the apologies and turns away from me to glare out the window. I try to placate her by describing how trendy, how luxurious the restaurant we\u0027re going to is, explaining its pasta with fennel and banana, its sorbets, but she only shakes her head and then I\u0027m reduced to telling her, oh Christ, about how Barcadia has gotten much more expensive even than Dorsia, but she is relentless. Her eyes, I swear, intermittently tear.\n She doesn\u0027t say anything until we\u0027re seated at a mediocre table near the back section of the main dining room and that\u0027s only to order a Bellini. For dinner I order the shad-roe ravioli with apple compote as an appetizer and the meat loaf with chevre and quail-stock sauce for an entree. She orders the red snapper with violets and pine nuts and for an appetizer a peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash which sounds strange but is actually quite good. New York magazine called it a \"playful but mysterious little dish\" and I repeat this to Patricia, who lights a cigarette while ignoring my lit match, sulkily slumped in her seat, exhaling smoke directly into my face, occasionally shooting furious looks at me which I politely ignore, being the gentleman that I can be. Once our plates arrive I just stare at my dinner - the meat loaf dark red triangles topped by chevre which has been tinted pink by pomegranate juice, squiggles of thick tan quail stock circling the beef, and mango slices dotting the rim of the wide black plate - for a long time, a little confused, before deciding to eat it, hesitantly picking up my fork.\n Even though dinner lasts only ninety minutes it feels as if we have been sitting in Barcadia for a week, and though I have no desire to visit Tunnel afterwards it seems appropriate punishment for Patricia\u0027s behavior. The bill comes to $320 - less than I expected, actually - and I put it on my platinum AmEx. In the cab heading downtown, my eyes locked on the meter, our driver tries to make conversation with Patricia who completely ignores him while checking her makeup in a Gucci compact, adding lipstick to an already heavily colored mouth. There was a baseball game on tonight that I think I forgot to videotape so I won\u0027t be able to watch it when I get home but I remember that I bought two magazines after work today and I can always spend an hour or so poring over those. I check my Rolex and realize that if we have one drink, maybe two, I\u0027ll get home in time for Late Night with David Letterman. Though physically Patricia is appealing and I wouldn\u0027t mind having sex with her body, the idea of treating her gently, of being a kind date, of apologizing for this evening, for not being able to get into Dorsia (even though Barcadia istwice as expensive for Christ sakes), rubs me the wrong way. The bitch is probably pissed we don\u0027t have a limo.\n The cab stops outside Tunnel. I pay the fare and leave the driver a decent tip and hold the door open for Patricia who ignores my hand when I try to help her step out of the cab. No one stands outside the ropes tonight. In fact the only person on Twenty-fourth Street is a bum who sits by a Dumpster, writhing in pain, moaning for change or food, and we pass quickly by him as one of the three doormen who stand behind the ropes lets us in, another one patting me on the back saying, \"How are you, Mr. McCullough?\" I nod, opening the door for Patricia, and before following her in say, \"Fine, uh, Jim,\" and I shake his hand.\n Once inside, after paying fifty dollars for the two of us, I head immediately to the bar without really caring if Patricia follows. I order a J\u0026B on the rocks. She wants a Perrier, no lime, and orders this herself. After I down half the drink, leaning against the bar and checking the hardbody waitress out, something suddenly seems out of place; it\u0027s not the lighting or INXS singing \"New Sensation\" or the hardbody behind the bar. It\u0027s something else. When I slowly turn around to take in the rest of the club I\u0027m confronted by space that is completely deserted. Patricia and myself are the only two customers in the entire club. We are, except for the occasional hardbody, literally the only two people in Tunnel. \"New Sensation\" becomes \"The Devil Inside\" and the music is full blast but it feels less loud because there isn\u0027t a crowd reacting to it, and the dance floor looks vast when empty. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-33.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: \n Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
