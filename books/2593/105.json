{"id":96564,"no":105,"title":"Page 105","content":"\"Yes?\" I say, then, \"Darling?\" \"Who hung the Onica?\" she asks. \"You like it?\" I ask. \"It\u0027s fine, but...\" She stops, then says, \"I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s hung upside down.\" \"What?\" \"Who hung the Onica?\" \"I did,\" I say, my back still to her. \"You\u0027ve hung the Onica upside down.\" She laughs. \"Hmmm?\" I\u0027m standing at the armoire, squeezing the nail gun, getting used to its weight in my gloved fist. \"I can\u0027t believe it\u0027s upside down,\" she says. \"How long has it been this way?\" \"A millennium,\" I whisper, turning around, nearing her. \"What?\" she asks, still studying the Onica. \"I said, what in the f**k are you doing with Robert Hall?\" I whisper. \"What did you say?\" As if in slow motion, like in a movie, she turns around. I wait until she\u0027s seen the nail gun and the gloved hands to scream, \"What the f**k are you doing with Robert Hall? \" Perhaps on instinct, perhaps from memory, she makes a futile dash for the front door, crying out. Though the chardonnay has dulled her reflexes, the Scotch I\u0027ve drunk has sharpened mine, and effortlessly I\u0027m leaping in front of her, blocking her escape, knocking her unconscious with four blows to the head from the nail gun. I drag her back into the living room, laying her across the floor over a white Voilacutro cotton sheet, and then I stretch her arms out, placing her hands flat on thick wooden boards, palms up, and nail three fingers on each hand, at random, to the wood by their tips. This causes her to regain consciousness and she starts screaming. After I\u0027ve sprayed Mace into her eyes, mouth, into her nostrils, I place a camel-hair coat from Ralph Lauren over her head, which drowns out the screams, sort of. I keep shooting nails into her hands until they\u0027re both covered - nails bunched together, twisted over each other in places, making it impossible for her to try and sit up. I have to remove her shoes, which slightly disappoints me, but she\u0027s kicking at the floor violently, leaving black scuff marks on the stained white oak. During this period I keep shouting \"You bitch\" at her and then my voice drops to a raspy whisper and into her ear I drool the line \"You f**king cunt.\" Finally, in agony, after I\u0027ve taken the coat off her face, she starts pleading, or at least tries to, the adrenaline momentarily overpowering the pain. \"Patrick oh god stop it please oh god stop hurting me...\" But, typically, the pain returns - it\u0027s too intense not to - and she passes out again and vomits, while unconscious, and I have to hold her head up so she doesn\u0027t choke on it and then I Mace her again. The fingers I haven\u0027t nailed I try to bite off, almost succeeding on her left thumb which I manage to chew all the flesh off of, leaving the bone exposed, and then I Mace her, needlessly, once more. I place the camel-hair coat back over her head in case she wakes up screaming, then set up the Sony palm-sized Handycam so I can film all of what follows. Once it\u0027s placed on its stand and running on automatic, with a pair of scissors I start to cut off her dress and when I get up to her chest I occasionally stab at her br**sts, accidentally (not really) slicing off one of her ni**les through the bra. She starts screaming again once I\u0027ve ripped her dress off, leaving Bethany in only her bra, its right cup darkened with blood, and her panties, which are soaked with urine, saving them for later. I lean in above her and shout, over her screams, \"Try to scream, scream, keep screaming...\" I\u0027ve opened all the windows and the door to my terrace and when I stand over her, the mouth opens and not even screams come out anymore, just horrible, guttural, animal-like noises, sometimes interrupted by retching sounds. \"Scream, honey,\" I urge, \"keep screaming.\" I lean down, even closer, brushing her hair back. \"No one cares. No one will help you...\" She tries to cry out again but she\u0027s losing consciousness and she\u0027s capable of only a weak moan. I take advantage of her helpless state and, removing my gloves, force her mouth open and with the scissors cut out her tongue, which I pull easily from her mouth and hold in the palm of my hand, warm and still bleeding, seeming so much smaller than in her mouth, and I throw it against the wall, where it sticks for a moment, leaving a stain, before falling to the floor with a tiny wet slap. Blood gushes out of her mouth and I have to hold her head up so she won\u0027t choke. Then I f**k her in the mouth, and after I\u0027ve ejaculated and pulled out, I Mace her some more. Later, when she briefly regains consciousness, I put on a porkpie hat I was given by one of my girlfriends freshman year at Harvard.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-105.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
