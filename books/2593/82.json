I take it from her, read it, then look at Evelyn, then back at the fortune, then out the tinted window, at snow flurries swirling around lampposts, around people waiting for buses, beggars staggering directionless down city streets, and I say out loud to myself, \"My luck could be worse. It really could.\" \"Oh honey,\" she says, throwing her arms around me, hugging my head. \"Lunch at Le Cirque? You\u0027re the best. You\u0027re not the Grinch. I take it back. Thursday? Is Thursday good for you? Oh no. I can\u0027t do it Thursday. Herbal wrap. But how\u0027s Friday? And do we really want to go to La Cirque? How about - \" I push her off me and knock on the divider, rapping my knuckles against it loudly until the driver lowers it. \"Sid, I mean Earle, whoever, this isn\u0027t the way to Chernoble.\" \"Yes it is, Mr. Bateman - \" \"Hey!\" \"I mean Mr. Halberstam. Avenue C, right?\" He coughs politely. \"I suppose,\" I say, staring out the window. \"I don\u0027t recognize anything. \"Avenue C?\" Evelyn looks up from marveling at the necklace Paul Owen bought Meredith. \"What\u0027s Avenue C? C as in... Cartier, I take it?\" \"It\u0027s hip,\" I assure her. \"It\u0027s totally hip.\" \"Have you been there?\" she asks. \"Millions of times,\" I mutter. \"Chernoble? No, not Chernoble, \" she whines. \"Honey, it\u0027s Christmas.\" \"What in the hell does that mean?\" I ask. \"Limo driver, oh limo driver...\" Evelyn leans forward, balancing herself on my knees. \"Limo driver, we\u0027re going to the Rainbow Room. Driver, to the Rainbow Room, please.\" I push her back and lean forward. \"Ignore her. Chernoble. ASAP.\" I press the button and the divider goes back up. \"Oh Patrick. It\u0027s Christmas,\" she whines. \"You keep saying that as if it means something,\" I say, staring right at her. \"But it\u0027s Christmas,\" she whines again. \"I can\u0027t stand the Rainbow Room,\" I say, adamant. \"Oh why not, Patrick?\" she whines. \"They have the best Waldorf salad in town at the Rainbow Room. Did you like mine? Did you like my Waldorf salad, honey?\" \"Oh my god,\" I whisper, covering my face with both heads. \"Honestly. Did you?\" she asks. \"The only thing I really worried about was that and the chestnut stuffing...\" She pauses. \"Well, because the chestnut stuffing was... well, gross, you know - \" \"I don\u0027t want to go to the Rainbow Room,\" I interrupt, my hands still covering my face, \"because I can\u0027t score drugs there.\" \"Oh...\" She looks me over, disapprovingly. \"Tsk, tsk, tsk. Drugs, Patrick? What kind of, ahem, drugs are we talking about?\" \"Drugs, Evelyn. Cocaine. Drugs. I want to do some cocaine tonight. Do you understand?\" I sit up and glare at her. \"Patrick,\" she says, shaking her head, as if she\u0027s lost faith in me. \"I can see you\u0027re confused,\" I point out. \"I just don\u0027t want any part of it,\" she says. \"You don\u0027t have to do any of it,\" I tell her. \"Maybe you\u0027re not even invited to do any of it.\" \"I just don\u0027t understand why you have to ruin this time of year for me,\" she says. \"Think of it as... frost. As Christmas frost. As expensive Christmas frost,\" I say, \"Well...,\" she says, lighting up. \"It\u0027s kind of exciting to slum, isn\u0027t it?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-82.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
