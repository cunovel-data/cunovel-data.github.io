Total riot,\" and we give each other high-five before he takes a seat between Dibble and Lloyd. God knows where they came from.\n Kevin Forrest, who walks in with Charles Murphy, is saying, \"My call waiting is busted. Felicia screwed it up somehow.\" I\u0027m not even paying attention to what they\u0027re wearing. But I find myself staring at Murphy\u0027s vintage owl cuff links with blue crystal eyes.\n Video Store then D\u0027Agostino\u0027s\n I\u0027m wandering around VideoVisions, the video rental store near my apartment on the Upper West Side, sipping from a can of Diet Pepsi, the new Christopher Cross tape blaring from the earphones of my Sony Walkman. After the office I played racquetball with Montgomery, then had a shiatsu massage and met Jesse Lloyd, Jamie Conway and Kevin Forrest for drinks at Rusty\u0027s on Seventy-third Street. Tonight I\u0027m wearing a new wool topcoat by Ungaro Uomo Paris and carrying a Bottega Veneta briefcase and an umbrella by Georges Gaspar.\n The video store is more crowded than usual. There are too many couples in line for me to rent She-Male Reformatory or Ginger\u0027s Cunt without some sense of awkwardness or discomfort, plus I\u0027ve already bumped into Robert Ailes from First Boston in the Horror aisle, or at least I think it was Robert Ailes. He mumbled \"Hello, McDonald\" as he passed me by, holding Friday the 13th: Part 7 and a documentary on abortions in what I noticed were nicely manicured hands marred only by what looked to me like an imitation-gold Rolex.\n Since p**n ography seems out of the question I browse through Light Comedy and, feeling ripped off, settle for a Woody Allen movie but I\u0027m still not satisfied. I want something else. I pass through the Rock Musical section - nothing - then find myself in Horror Comedy - ditto - and suddenly I\u0027m seized by a minor anxiety attack. There are too many f**king movies to choose from. I duck behind a promotional cardboard display for the new Dan Aykroyd comedy and take two five-milligram Valiums, washing them down with the Diet Pepsi. Then, almost by rote, as if I\u0027ve been programmed, I reach for Body Double - a movie I have rented thirty-seven times - and walk up to the counter where I wait for twenty minutes to be checked out by a dumpy girl (five pounds overweight, dry frizzy hair). She\u0027s actually wearing a baggy, nondescript sweater - definitely not designer - probably to hide the fact that she has no tits, and even though she has nice eyes: so f**king what? Finally it\u0027s my turn. I hand her the empty boxes.\n \"Is this it?\" she asks, taking my membership card from me. I\u0027m wearing Mario Valentino Persian-black gloves. My VideoVisions membership costs only two hundred and fifty dollars annually.\n \"Do you have any Jami Gertz movies?\" I ask her, trying to make direct eye contact.\n \"What?\" she asks, distracted.\n \"Any movies that Jami Gertz is in?\"\n \"Wh o?\" She enters something into the computer and then says without looking at me, \"How many nights?\"\n \"Three,\" I say. \"Don\u0027t you know who Jami Gertz is?\"\n \"I don\u0027t think so.\" She actually sighs.\n \"Jami Gertz,\" I say. \"She\u0027s an actress.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think I know who you mean,\" she says in a tone that suggests I\u0027m harassing her, but hey, she works in a video rental store and since it\u0027s such a demanding high-powered profession her bitchy behavior is completely reasonable, right? The things I could do to this girl\u0027s body with a hammer, the words I could carve into her with an ice pick. She hands the guy behind her my boxes - and I pretend to ignore his horrified reaction as he recognizes me after he looks at the Body Double box - but he dutifully walks into some kind of vault in the back of the store to get the movies.\n \"Yeah. Sure you do,\" I say good-naturedly. \"She\u0027s in those Diet Coke commercials. You know the ones.\"\n \"I really don\u0027t think so,\" she says in a monotone that almost cuts me off. She types the names of the movies and then my membership number into the computer.\n \"I like the part in Body Double where the woman... gets drilled by the... power driller in the movie... the best,\" I say, almost gasping. It seems very hot in the video store right now all of a sudden and after murmuring \"oh my god\" under my breath I place a gloved hand on the counter to settle it from shaking. \"And the blood starts pouring out of the ceiling.\" I take a deep breath and while I\u0027m saying this my head starts nodding of its own accord and I keep swallowing, thinking I have to see her shoes, and so as inconspicuously as possible I try to peer over the counter to check out what kind of shoes she\u0027s wearing, but maddeningly they\u0027re only sneakers - not K-Swiss, not Tretorn, not Adidas, not Reebok, just cheap ones. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-48.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: \n Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
