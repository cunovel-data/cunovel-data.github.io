{"id":96609,"no":150,"title":"Page 150","content":"...while running toward Wall Street, still in Tribeca, he stays away from where the streetlamps shine the brightest, notices that the entire block he\u0027s lurching down is gentrified, then he dashes past a row of Porsches, tries to open each one and sets a string of car alarm sirens off, the car he would like to steal is a black Range Rover with permanent four-wheel drive, an aircraft-grade aluminum body on a boxed steel chassis and a fuel-injected V-8 engine, but he can\u0027t find one, and though this disappoints him he\u0027s also intoxicated by the whirlwind of confusion, by the city itself, the rain falling from an ice-cold sky but still warm enough in the city, on the ground, for fog to drift through the passageways the skyscrapers create in Battery Park, in Wall Street, wherever, most of them a kaleidoscopic blur, and now he\u0027s jumping over an embankment, somersaulting over it, then he\u0027s running like crazy, running full tilt, his brain locked into the physical exertion of utter, sheer panic, helter-skelter, now he thinks a car is following him down a deserted highway, now he feels the night accepts him, from somewhere else a shot is heard but doesn\u0027t really register because Patrick\u0027s mind is out of sync, forgetting his destination, until like a mirage his once building, where Pierce \u0026 Pierce is located, comes into view, the lights in it going off, floor by floor, as if a darkness is rising through it, running another hundred yards, two hundred yards, ducking into the stairs, below, where? his senses blocked for the first time with fear and bewilderment, and dumbstruck with confusion he rushes into the lobby of what he thinks is his building, but no, something seems wrong, what is it? you moved (the move itself was a nightmare even though Patrick has a better office now; the new Barney\u0027s and Godiva stores adjacent to the lobby ease the strain) and he\u0027s gotten the buildings mixed up, it\u0027s only at the elevator...\n ...doors, both of which are locked, where he notices the huge Julian Schnabel in the lobby and he realizes wrong f**king building and he whirls around, making a mad scramble for the revolving doors, but the night watchman who tried to get Patrick\u0027s attention before now waves him in, as he\u0027s about to bolt out of the lobby, \"Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Smith? You forgot to sign in,\" and frustrated, Patrick shoots at him while spinning once, twice through the glass doors which thrust him back into the lobby of god only knows where as the bullet catches the watchman in the throat, knocking him backward, leaving a spray of blood hanging momentarily in midair before drizzling down on the watchman\u0027s contorted, twisted face, and the black janitor Patrick has just noticed has been watching the scene from a corner of the lobby, mop in hand, bucket by his feet, drops the mop, raises his hands, and Patrick shoots him right between the eyes, a stream of blood covers his face, the back of his head explodes in a spray, behind him the bullet knocks out a chunk of marble, the force of the blast slams him against the wall, Patrick dashing across the street toward the light of his new office, when he walks in...\n ...nodding toward Gus,our night watchman, signing in, heading up in the elevator, higher, toward the darkness of his floor, calm is eventually restored, safe in the anonymity of my new office, able with shaking hands to pick up the cordless phone, looking through my Rolodex, exhausted, eyes falling upon Harold Carnes\u0027 number, dialing the seven digits slowly, breathing deeply, evenly, I decide to make public what has been, until now, my private dementia, but Harold isn\u0027t in, business, London, I leave a message, admitting everything, leaving nothing out, thirty, forty, a hundred murders, and while I\u0027m on the phone with Harold\u0027s machine a helicopter with a searchlight appears, flying low over the river, lightning cracks the sky open in jagged bolts behind it, heading toward the building I was last at, descending to land on the building\u0027s roof across from this one, the bottom of the building surrounded already by police cars, two ambulances, and a SWAT team leaps out of the helicopter, a half-dozen armed men disappear into the entrance on the deck of the roof, flares are lined up what seems like everywhere, and I\u0027m watching all of this with the phone in my hand, crouched by my desk, sobbing though I don\u0027t know why, into Harold\u0027s machine, \"I left her in a parking lot... near a Dunkin\u0027 Donuts... somewhere around midtown...\" and finally, after ten minutes of this, I sign off by concluding, \"Uh, I\u0027m a pretty sick guy,\" then hang up, but I call back and after an interminable beep, proving my message was indeed recorded, I leave another: \"Listen, it\u0027s Bateman again, and if you get back tomorrow, I may show up at Da Umberto\u0027s tonight so, you know, keep your eyes open,\" and the sun, a planet on fire, gradually rises over Manhattan, another sunrise, and soon the night turns into day so fast it\u0027s like some kind of optical illusion... \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-150.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: \n Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
