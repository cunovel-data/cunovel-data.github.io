We buy balloons, we let them go.\\n\\n Detective\\n\\n May slides into June which slides into July which creeps toward August. Because of the heat I\u0027ve had intense dreams the last four nights about vivisection and I\u0027m doing nothing now, vegetating in my office with a sickening headache and a Walkman with a soothing Kenny G CD playing in it, but the bright midmorning sunlight floods the room, piercing my skull, causing my hangover to throb, and because of this, there\u0027s no workout this morning. Listening to the music I notice the second light on my phone blinking off and on, which means that Jean is buzzing me. I sigh and carefully remove the Walkman.\\n\\n \"What is it?\" I ask in monotone.\\n\\n \"Um, Patrick?\" she begins.\\n\\n \"Ye-es, Je-an?\" I ask condescendingly, spacing the two words out.\\n\\n \"Patrick, a Mr. Donald Kimball is here to see you,\" she says nervously.\\n\\n \"Who?\" I snap, distracted.\\n\\n She emits a small sigh of worry, then, as if asking, lowers her voice. \"Detective Donald Kimball?\"\\n\\n I pause, staring out the window into sky, then at my monitor, then at the headless woman I\u0027ve been doodling on the back cover of this week\u0027s Sports Illustrated, and I run my hand over the glossy finish of the magazine once, twice, before tearing the cover off and crumpling it up. Finally I start. \"Tell him...\" Then, mulling it over, rethinking my options, I stop and begin again. \"Tell him I\u0027m at lunch.\"\\n\\n Jean pauses, then whispers. \"Patrick... I think he knows you\u0027re here.\" During my protracted silence, she adds, still hushed, \"It\u0027s ten-thirty.\"\\n\\n I sigh, stalling again, and in a contained panic tell Jean, \"Send him in, I guess.\"\\n\\n I stand up, walk over to the Jodi mirror that hangs next to the George Stubbs painting and check my hair, running an oxhorn comb through it, then, calmly, I pick up one of my cordless phones and, preparing myself for a tense scene, pretend to be talking with John Akers, and I start enunciating clearly into the phone before the detective enters the office.\\n\\n \"Now, John...\" I clear my throat. \"You\u0027ve got to wear clothes in proportion to your physique,\" I begin, talking to nobody. \"There are definitely dos and don\u0027ts, good buddy, of wearing a bold-striped shirt. A bold-striped shirt calls for solid colored or discreetly patterned suits and ties....\"\\n\\n The door to the office opens and I wave in the detective, who is surprisingly young, maybe my age, wearing a linen Armani suit not unlike mine, though his is slightly disheveled in a hip way, which worries me. I offer a reassuring smile.\\n\\n \"And a shirt with a high yarn count means it\u0027s more durable than one that doesn\u0027t... Yes, I know... But to determine this you\u0027ve got to examine the material\u0027s weave ...\" I point to the Mark Schrager chrome and teak chair on the opposite side of my desk, silently urging him to sit.\\n\\n \"Tightly woven fabric is created not only by using a lot of yarn but by using yarn of high-quality fibers, both long and thin, which... yes... which are... which fabricate a close weave as opposed to short and stubbly fibers, like those found in tweed. And loosely woven fabrics such as knits are extremely delicate and should be treated with great care...\" Because of the detective\u0027s arrival, it seems unlikely that this will be a good day and I eye him warily as he takes the seat and crosses his legs in a way that fills me with a nameless dread. I realize I\u0027ve been quiet too long when he turns around to see if I\u0027m off the phone.\\n\\n \"Right, and... Yes, John, right. And... yes, always tip the stylist fifteen percent...\" I pause. \"No, the owner of the salon shouldn\u0027t be tipped.... \" I shrug at the detective hopelessly, rolling my eyes. He nods, smiles understandingly and recrosses his legs. Nice socks. Jesus. \"The girl who washes the hair? It depends. I\u0027d say a-dollar or two...\" I laugh. \"Depends on what she looks like...\" I laugh harder. \"And yeah, what else she washes...\" I pause again, then say, \"Listen, John, I\u0027ve got to go. T. Boone Pickens just walked in...\" I pause, grinning like an idiot, then laugh. \"Just joking...\" Another pause. \"No, don\u0027t tip the owner of the salon.\" I laugh once more, then, finally, \"Okay, John... right, got it.\" I hang up the phone, push its antenna down and then, uselessly stressing my normality, say, \"Sorry about that.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-114.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
