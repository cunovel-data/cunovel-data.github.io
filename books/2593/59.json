{"id":96518,"no":59,"title":"Page 59","content":"In terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer songwriting skills this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Take the lyrics to \"Land of Confusion,\" in which a singer addresses the problem of abusive political authority. This is laid down with a groove funkier and blacker than anything Prince or Michael Jackson - or any other black artist of recent years, for that matter - has come up with. Yet as danceable as the album is, it also has a stripped-down urgency that not even the overrated Bruce Springsteen can equal. As an observer of love\u0027s failings Collins beats out the Boss again and again, reaching new heights of emotional honesty on \"In Too Deep\"; yet it also showcases Collins\u0027 clowny, prankish, unpredictable side. It\u0027s the most moving pop song of the 1980s about monogamy and commitment. \"Anything She Does\" (which echoes the J. Geils Band\u0027s \"Centerfold\" but is more spirited and energetic) starts off side two and after that the album reaches its peak with \"Domino,\" a two-part song. Part one, \"In the Heat of the Night,\" is full of sharp, finely drawn images of despair and it\u0027s paired with \"The Last Domino,\" which fights it with an expression of hope. This song is extremely uplifting. The lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I\u0027ve heard in rock.\\n\\n Phil Collins\u0027 solo efforts seem to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying in a narrower way, especially No Jacket Required and songs like \"In the Air Tonight\" and \"Against All Odds\" (though that song was overshadowed by the masterful movie from which it came) and \"Take Me Home\" and \"Sussudio\" (great, great song; a personal favorite) and his remake of \"You Can\u0027t Hurry Love,\" which I\u0027m not alone in thinking is better than the Supremes\u0027 original. But I also think that Phil Collins works better within the confines of the group than as a solo artist - and I stress the word artist. In fact it applies to all three of the guys, because Genesis is still the best, most exciting band to come out of England in the 1980s.\\n\\n Lunch\\n\\n I\u0027m sitting in DuPlex, the new Tony McManus restaurant in Tribeca, with Christopher Armstrong, who also works at P \u0026 P. We went to Exeter together, then he went to the University of Pennsylvania and Wharton, before moving to Manhattan. We, inexplicably, could not get reservations at Subjects, so Armstrong suggested this place. Armstrong is wearing a four-button double-breasted chalk-striped spread-collar cotton shirt by Christian Dior and a large paisley-patterned silk tie by Givenchy Gentleman. His leather agenda and leather envelope, both by Bottega Veneta, lie on the third chair at our table, a good one, up front by the window. I\u0027m wearing a nailhead-patterned worsted wool suit with overplaid from DeRigueur by Schoeneman, a cotton broadcloth shirt by Bill Blass, a Macclesfield silk tie by Savoy and a cotton handkerchief by Ashear Bros. A Muzak rendition of the score from Les Miserables plays lightly throughout the restaurant. Armstrong\u0027s girlfriend is Jody Stafford, who used to date Todd Hamlin, and this fact plus the TV monitors hanging from the ceilings with closed-circuit video of chefs working in the kitchen fills me with nameless dread. Armstrong just got back from the islands and has a very deep, very even tan, but so do I.\\n\\n \"So how were the Bahamas?\" I ask after we order. \"You just got back, right?\"\\n\\n \"Well, Taylor,\" Armstrong begins, staring at a point somewhere behind me and slightly above my head - on the column that has been terra-cotta-ized or perhaps on the exposed pipe that runs the length of the ceiling. \"Travelers looking for that perfect vacation this summer may do well to look south, as far south as the Bahamas and the Caribbean islands. There are at least five smart reasons for visiting the Caribbean including the weather and the festivals and events, the less crowded hotels and attractions, the price and the unique cultures. While many vacationers leave the cities in search of cooler climates during the summer months, few have realized that the Caribbean has a year-round climate of seventy-five to eighty-five degrees and that the islands are constantly cooled by the trade winds. It is frequently hotter north in...\"\\n\\n On The Patty Winters Show this morning the topic was Toddler-Murderers. In the studio audience were parents of children who\u0027d been kidnapped, tortured and murdered, while on stage a panel of psychiatrists and pediatricians were trying to help them cope - somewhat futilely I might add, and much to my delight - with their confusion and anger. But what really cracked me up was - via satellite on a lone TV monitor - three convicted Toddler-Murderers on death row who due to fairly complicated legal loopholes were now seeking parole and would probably get it. But something kept distracting me while I watched the huge Sony TV over a breakfast of sliced kiwi and Japanese apple-pear, Evian water, oat-bran muffins, soy milk and cinnamon granola, ruining my enjoyment of the grieving mothers, and it wasn\u0027t until the show was almost over that I figured out what it was: the crack above my David Onica that I had asked the doorman to tell the superintendent to fix. On my way out this morning I stopped at the front desk, about to complain to the doorman, when I was confronted with a new doorman, my age but balding and homely and fat. Three glazed jelly doughnuts and two steaming cups of extra-dark hot chocolate lay on the desk in front of him beside a copy of the Post opened to the comics and it struck me that I was infinitely better-looking, more successful and richer than this poor bastard would ever be and so with a passing rush of sympathy I smiled and nodded a curt though not impolite good morning without lodging a complaint. \"Oh really?\" I find myself saying loudly, completely uninterested, to Armstrong. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-59.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
