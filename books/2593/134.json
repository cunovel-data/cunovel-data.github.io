But let\u0027s go somewhere else and, uh, then go on the search for the, uh, perfect body. Gentlemen?\"\\n\\n \"Sounds good,\" I say, amused that Hamlin, for once, has the right idea. \"But what is Cindy going to say about this?\"\\n\\n \"Cindy has to go to a charity thing at the Plaza, something - \"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the Trump Plaza,\" I note absently, while finally opening the Perrier bottle.\\n\\n \"Yeah, the Trump Plaza,\" he says. \"Something about trees near the library. Money for trees or a bush of some kind,\" he says, unsure. \"Plants? Beats me.\"\\n\\n \"So where to?\" McDermott asks.\\n\\n \"Who cancels 1500?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"You do,\" McDermott says.\\n\\n \"Oh McDermott,\" I moan, \"Just do it.\"\\n\\n \"Wait,\" Hamlin says. \"Let\u0027s decide where we\u0027re going first.\"\\n\\n \"Agreed.\" McDermott, the parliamentarian.\\n\\n \"I am fanatically opposed to anywhere not on the Upper West or Upper East side of this city,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Bellini\u0027s?\" Hamlin suggests.\\n\\n \"Nope. Can\u0027t smoke cigars there,\" McDermott and I say at the same time.\\n\\n \"Cross that one out,\" Hamlin says. \"Gandango?\" he suggests.\\n\\n \"Possibility, possibility,\" I murmur, mulling it over. \"Trump eats there.\"\\n\\n \"Zeus Bar?\" one of them asks.\\n\\n \"Make a reservation,\" says the other.\\n\\n \"Wait,\" I tell them, \"I\u0027m thinking.\"\\n\\n \"Bateman ...,\" Hamlin warns.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m toying with the idea,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Bateman ...\"\\n\\n \"Wait. Let me toy for a minute.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m really too irritated to be dealing with this right now,\" McDermott says.\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t we just forget this shit and bash some Japs,\" Hamlin suggests. \"Then find the perfect body.\"\\n\\n \"Not a bad idea, actually.\" I shrug. \"Decent combo.\"\\n\\n \"What do you want to do, Bateman?\" McDermott asks.\\n\\n Thinking about it, thousands of miles away, I answer, \"I want to...\"\\n\\n \"Yes...?\" they both ask expectantly.\\n\\n \"I want to... pulverize a woman\u0027s face with a large, heavy brick.\"\\n\\n \"Besides that,\" Hamlin moans impatiently.\\n\\n \"Okay, fine,\" I say, snapping out of it. \"Zeus Bar.\"\\n\\n \"You sure? Right? Zeus Bar?\" Hamlin concludes, he hopes.\\n\\n \"Guys. I am finding myself increasingly incapable of dealing with this at all,\" McDermott says. \"Zeus Bar. That\u0027s final.\"\\n\\n \"Hold on,\" Hamlin says. \"I\u0027ll call and make a reservation.\" He clicks off, leaving McDermott and myself on hold. It\u0027s silent for a long time before either one of us says anything.\\n\\n \"You know,\" I finally say. \"It will probably be impossible to get a reservation there.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe we should go to M.K. The Texan would probably like to go to M.K.,\" Craig says.\\n\\n \"But, McDermott, the Texan isn\u0027t coming,\" I point out.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t go to M.K. anyway,\" he says, not listening, and he doesn\u0027t mention why.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to know about it.\"\\n\\n We wait two more minutes for Hamlin.\\n\\n \"What in the hell is he doing?\" I ask, then my call waiting clicks in.\\n\\n McDermott hears it too. \"Do you want to take that?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m thinking.\" It clicks again. I moan and tell McDermott to hold on. It\u0027s Jeanette. She sounds tired and sad. I don\u0027t want to get back on the other line so I ask her what she did last night.\\n\\n \"After you were supposed to meet me?\" she asks.\\n\\n I pause, unsure. \"Uh, yeah.\"\\n\\n \"We ended up at Palladium which was completely empty. They were letting in people for free.\" She signs. \"We saw maybe four or five people.\"\\n\\n \"That you knew?\" I ask hopefully.\\n\\n \"In... the... club,\" she says, spacing each word out bitterly.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I finally say. \"I had to... return some videotapes...\" And then, reacting to her silence, \"You know, I would\u0027ve met you - \"\\n\\n \"I.don\u0027t want to hear about it,\" she sighs, cutting me off. \"What are you doing tonight?\"\\n\\n I pause, wondering how to answer, before admitting, \"Zeus Bar at nine. McDermott. Hamlin.\" And then, less hopefully, \"Would you like to meet us?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" she sighs. Without a trace of softness she asks, \"Do you want me to?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-134.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
