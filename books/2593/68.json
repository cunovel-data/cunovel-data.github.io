{"id":96527,"no":68,"title":"Page 68","content":"\"I\u0027ve seen you looking at me,\" he says, panting. \"I\u0027ve noticed your\" - he gulps - \"hot body.\"\\n\\n He tries to kiss me on the lips but I back away, into the stall door, accidentally closing it. I drop my hands from Luis\u0027s neck and he takes them and immediately places them back. I drop them once again and stand there contemplating my next move, but I\u0027m immobile.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be... shy,\" he says.\\n\\n I take a deep breath, close my eyes, count to ten, open them and make a helpless attempt to lift my arms back up to strangle Luis, but they feel weighed down and lifting them becomes an impossible task.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know how long I\u0027ve wanted it...\" He\u0027s sighing, rubbing my shoulders, trembling. \"Ever since that Christmas party at Arizona 206. You know the one, you were wearing that red striped paisley Armani tie.\"\\n\\n For the first time I notice his pants are still unzipped and calmly and without difficulty I turn out of the stall and move over to a sink to wash my hands, but my gloves are still on and I don\u0027t want to take them off. The bathroom at the Yale Club suddenly seems to me to be the coldest room in the universe and I shudder involuntarily. Luis trails behind, touching my jacket, leaning next to me at the sink.\\n\\n \"I want you,\" he says in a low, faggoty whisper and when I slowly turn my head to glare at him, while hunched over the sink, seething, my eye contact radiating revulsion, he adds, \"too.\"\\n\\n I storm out of the men\u0027s room, bumping into Brewster Whipple, I think. I smile at the maitre d\u0027 and after shaking his hand I make a run for the closing elevator but I\u0027m too late and I cry out, pounding a fist against the doors, cursing. Composing myself, I notice the maitre d\u0027 conferring with a waiter, the two of them looking my way questioningly, and so I straighten up, smile shyly and wave at them. Luis strides over calmly, still grinning, flushed, and I just stand there and let him walk up to me. He says nothing.\\n\\n \"What... is... it?\" I finally hiss.\\n\\n \"Where are you going?\" he whispers, bewildered.\\n\\n \"I... I\u0027ve gotta...\" Stumped, I look around the crowded dining room, then back at Luis\u0027s quivering, yearning face. \"I\u0027ve gotta return some videotapes,\" I say, jabbing at the elevator button, then, my patience shot, I start to walk away and head back toward my table.\\n\\n \"Patrick,\" he calls out.\\n\\n I whirl around. \"What? \"\\n\\n He mouths \"I\u0027ll call you\" with this expression on his face that lets me know, that assures me, my \"secret\" is safe with him. \"Oh my god,\" I practically gag, and shaking visibly I sit back at our table, completely defeated, my gloves still on, and gulp down the rest of a watery J\u0026B on the rocks. As soon as I\u0027ve seated myself Van Patten asks, \"Hey Bateman, what\u0027s the right way to wear a tie bar or clasp?\"\\n\\n \"While a tie holder is by no means required businesswear, it adds to a clean, neat overall appearance. But the accessory shouldn\u0027t dominate the tie. Choose a simple gold bar or a small clip and place it at the lower end of the tie at a downward forty-five-degree angle.\"\\n\\n Killing Dog\\n\\n Courtney calls, too wasted on Elavil to meet me for a coherent dinner at Cranes, the new Kitty Oates Sanders restaurant in Gramercy Park where Jean, my secretary, made reservations for us last week, and I\u0027m nonplussed. Even though it got excellent reviews (one in New York magazine; the other in The Nation) I don\u0027t complain or persuade Courtney to change her mind since I have two files I should go over and The Patty Winters Show I taped this morning hasn\u0027t been watched yet. It\u0027s sixty minutes about women who\u0027ve had mastectomies, which at seven-thirty, over breakfast, before the office, I couldn\u0027t bear to sit through, but after today - hanging out at the office, where the air-conditioning broke down, a tedious lunch with Cunningham at Odeon, my f**king Chinese cleaners unable to get bloodstains out of another Soprani jacket, four videotapes overdue that ended up costing me a fortune, a twenty-minute wait at the Stairmasters - I\u0027ve adapted; these events have toughened me and I\u0027m prepared to deal with this particular topic.\\n\\n Two thousand abdominal crunches and thirty minutes of rope jumping in the living room, the Wurlitzer jukebox blasting \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\" over and over, even though I worked out in the gym today for close to two hours. After this I get dressed to pick up groceries at D\u0027Agostino\u0027s: blue jeans by Armani, a white Polo shirt, an Armani sport coat, no tie, hair slicked back with Thompson mousse; since it\u0027s drizzling, a pair of black waterproof lace-ups by Manolo Blahnik; three knives and two guns carried in a black Epi leather attache case ($3,200) by Louis Vuitton; because it\u0027s cold and I don\u0027t want to f**k up my manicure, a pair of Armani deerskin gloves. Finally, a belted trench coat in black leather by Cianfranco Ferre that cost four thousand dollars. Though it\u0027s only a short walk to D\u0027Agostino\u0027s, I put on a CD Walkman anyway, with the long version of Bon Jovi\u0027s \"Wanted Dead or Alive\" already in it. I grab an Etro wood-handled paisley umbrella from Bergdorf Goodman, three hundred dollars on sale, off a newly installed umbrella rack in the closet near the entranceway and I\u0027m out the door. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-68.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
