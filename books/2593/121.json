{"id":96580,"no":121,"title":"Page 121","content":"Girls \"I thought the pinto beans with salmon and mint were really, really... you know,\" Elizabeth says, walking into the living room of my apartment and in one graceful movement kicking off both satin and suede Maud Frizon pumps and flopping onto the couch, \"good, but Patrick, my god it was expensive and,\" then, bristling, she bitches, \"it wasonly pseudo nouvelle.\" \"Was it my imagination or were there goldfish on the tables?\" I ask, undoing my Brooks Brothers suspenders while searching the refrigerator for a bottle of sauvignon blanc. \"Anyway,I thought it was hip.\" Christie has taken a seat on the long, wide sofa, away from Elizabeth, who stretches out lazily. \"Hip, Patrick?\" she calls out. \"Donald Trump eats there.\" I locate the bottle and stand it on the counter and, before finding a wine opener, stare at her blankly from across the room. \"Yes? Is this a sarcastic comment?\" \"Guess,\" she moans and follows it with a \"Duh\" so loud that Christie flinches. \"Where are you working now, Elizabeth?\" I ask, closing drawers. \"Polo outlet or something?\" Elizabeth cracks up at this and says blithely, while I uncork the Acacia, \"I don\u0027t have to work, Bateman,\" and after a beat she adds, bored, \"You of all people should know how that feels, Mr. Wall Street.\" She\u0027s checking her lipstick in a Gucci compact; predictably it looks perfect. Changing the subject, I ask, \"Who chose that place anyway?\" I pour the two girls wine and then make myself a J\u0026B on the rocks with a little water. \"The restaurant, I mean.\" \"Carson did. Or maybe Robert.\" Elizabeth shrugs and then after snapping the compact shut, staring intently at Christie, asks, \"You look really familiar. Did you go to Dalton?\" Christie shakes her head no. It\u0027s almost three in the morning. I\u0027m grinding up a tab of Ecstasy and watching it dissolve in the wineglass I plan to hand Elizabeth. This morning\u0027s topic on The Patty Winters Show was People Who Weigh Over Seven Hundred Pounds - What Can We Do About Them? I switch on the kitchen lights, find two more tabs of the drug in the freezer, then shut the lights off. Elizabeth is a twenty-year-old hardbody who sometimes models in Georges Marciano ads and who comes from an old Virginia banking family. We had dinner earlier tonight with two friends of hers, Robert Farrell, twenty-seven, a guy who\u0027s had a rather sketchy career as a financier, and Carson Whitall, who was Robert\u0027s date. Robert wore a wool suit by Belvest, a cotton shirt with French cuffs by Charvet, an abstract-patterned silk-crepe tie by Hugo Boss and sunglasses by Ray-Ban that he insisted on wearing during the meal. Carson wore a suit by Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche and a pearl necklace with matching pearl and diamond earrings by Harry Winston. We had dinner at Free Spin, the new Albert Lioman restaurant in the Flatiron district, then took the limousine to Nell\u0027s, where I excused myself, assuring an irate Elizabeth I\u0027d be right back, and directed the chauffeur to the meat-packing district, where I picked up Christie. I made her wait in the back of the locked limousine while I reentered Nell\u0027s and had drinks with Elizabeth and Carson and Robert in one of the booths up front, empty since the place had no celebrities in it tonight - a bad sign. Finally, at two-thirty, while Carson bragged drunkenly about her monthly flower bill, Elizabeth and I split. She was so pissed off about something Carson told her was in the latest issue of W that she didn\u0027t even question Christie\u0027s presence. In the ride back toward Nell\u0027s Christie had admitted that she was still upset about the last time we shared together, and that she had major reservations about tonight, but the money I\u0027ve offered is simply too good to pass up and I promised her that nothing like last time will be repeated. Though she was still scared, a few shots of vodka in the back of the limo along with the money I\u0027d given her so far, over sixteen hundred dollars, relaxed her like a tranquilizer. Her moodiness turned me on and she acted like a total sex kitten when I first handed her the cash amount - six bills attached to a Hughlans silver money clip - but after I urged her into the limo she told me that she might need surgery after what happened last time, or a lawyer, so I wrote out a check to cash in the amount of one thousand dollars, but since I knew it would never be cashed I didn\u0027t have a panic attack about it or anything. Looking over at Elizabeth right now, in my apartment, I\u0027m noticing how well endowed she is in the chest area and I\u0027m hoping that after the Ecstasy hits her system I can convince the two girls to have sex in front of me. Elizabeth is asking Christie if she\u0027s ever met some ass**le named Spicey or been to Au Bar. Christie is shaking her head I hand Elizabeth the Ecstasy-laden sauvignon blanc while she stares at Christie like she was from Neptune, and after recovering from Christie\u0027s admission she yawns. \"Anyway, Au Bar sucks now. It\u0027s terrible. I went to a birthday party there for Malcolm Forbes. Oh my god, please.\" She downs the wine, facing. I take a seat in one of the chrome and oak Sottsass chairs and reach over to the ice bucket that sits on the glass-top coffee table, adjusting the bottle of wine in order to chill it better. Immediately Elizabeth makes a move for it, pouring herself another glass. I dissolve two more tabs of the Ecstasy in the bottle before bringing it into the living room. A sullen Christie sips her untainted wine cautiously and tries not to stare at the floor; she still seems scared, and finding the silence unbearable or incriminating she asks Elizabeth where she met me.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-121.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
