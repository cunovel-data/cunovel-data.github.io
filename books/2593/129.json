{"id":96588,"no":129,"title":"Page 129","content":"Midnight. The conversation I have with the two girls, both very young, blond hardbodies with big tits, is brief, since I\u0027m having a difficult time containing my disordered self.\n \"You live in a palace, mister,\" one of the girls, Torri, says in a baby\u0027s voice, awed by Owen\u0027s ridiculous-looking condo. \"It\u0027s a real palace.\"\n Annoyed, I shoot her a glance. \"It\u0027s not that nice.\"\n While making drinks from Owen\u0027s well-stocked bar, I mention to both of them that I work on Wall Street, at Pierce \u0026 Pierce. Neither seems particularly interested. Again, I find myself hearing a voice - one of theirs - asking if that\u0027s a shoe store. Tiffany flips through an issue of GQ that\u0027s three months old, sitting on the black leather couch beneath the strip of faux-cowhide paneling, and she\u0027s looking confused, like she doesn\u0027t understand something, anything. I\u0027m thinking, Pray, you bitch, just pray, and then I have to admit to myself what a turn-on it is encouraging these girls to debase themselves in front of me for what amounts to pocket change. I also mention, after pouring them another drink, that I went to Harvard, and then I ask, after a pause, \"Ever hear of it?\"\n I\u0027m shocked when Torri answers, \"I had a business acquaintance who said he went there.\" She shrugs dumbly.\n \"A client?\" I ask, interested.\n \"Well,\" she starts nervously. \"Let\u0027s just say a business acquaintance.\"\n \"Was this a pimp?\" I ask - then the weird part happens.\n \"Well\" - she stalls again before continuing - \"let\u0027s just call him a business acquaintance.\" She sips from her glass. \"He said he went to Harvard, but... I didn\u0027t believe him.\" She looks over at Tiffany, then back at me. Our mutual silence encourages her to keep talking and she continues haltingly. \"He had, like, this monkey. And I would have to watch this monkey in... his apartment.\" She stops, starts, continues in monotone, occasionally gulping. \"I\u0027d want to watch TV all day, \u0027cause there was nothing else to do while the guy was out... and while I tried to keep an eye on the monkey. But there was... something wrong with this monkey.\" She stops and takes a deep breath. \"The monkey would only watch...\" Again she stops, takes in the room, a quizzical expression creasing her face as if she\u0027s not sure she should be telling us this story; if we, me and the other bitch, should be privy to this information. And I brace myself for something shocking, something revelatory, a connection. \"It would only watch...\" She sighs, then in a sudden rush admits, \"The Opnah Winfrey Show and that\u0027s all it would watch. The guy had tapes and tapes of it and he had made all of them for this monkey\" - now she looks over at me, imploringly, as if she\u0027s losing her mind here, right now, in Owen\u0027s apartment and wants me to, what, verify it? - \"with the commercials edited out. One time I tried to... turn the channel, turn one of the tapes off... if I wanted to watch a soap instead or something... but\" - she finishes her drink and rolling her eyes, obviously upset by this story, continues bravely - \"the monkey would s-s-screech at me and it would only calm down when Oprah was on.\" She swallows, clears her throat, looks like she\u0027s going to cry but doesn\u0027t. \"And you know, you try to turn the channel and that d-damn monkey would try to scratch you,\" she concludes bitterly and hugs herself, shivering, uselessly trying to warm herself.\n Silence. Arctic, frigid, utter silence. The light burning over us in the apartment is cold and electric. Standing there, I look at Torri then at the other girl, Tiffany, who looks queasy.\n I finally say something, stumbling over my own words. \"I don\u0027t care... whether you\u0027ve led a... decent life... or not.\"\n Sex happens - a hard-core montage. After I shave Torri\u0027s pu**y she lies on her back on Paul\u0027s futon and spreads her legs while I finger her and suck it off, sometimes licking her ass**le. Then Tiffany sucks my c**k - her tongue is hot and wet and she keeps flicking it over the head, irritating me - while I call her a nasty whore, a bitch. Fucking one of them with a condom while the other sucks my balls, lapping at them, I stare at the Angelic silk-screen print hanging over the bed and I\u0027m thinking about pools of blood, geysers of the stuff. Sometimes it\u0027s very quiet in the room except for the wet sounds my c**k makes slipping in and out of one of the girls\u0027 vaginas. Tiffany and I take turns eating Torri\u0027s hairless cunt and ass**le. The two of them come, yelling simultaneously, in a sixty-nine position. Once their cunts are wet enough I bring out a dildo and let the two of them play with it. Torri spreads her legs and fingers her own slit while Tiffany f**ks her with the huge, greased dildo, Torri urging Tiffany to f**k her cunt harder with it, until finally, gasping, she comes. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-129.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: \n Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
