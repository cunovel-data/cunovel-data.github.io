You look great. Very fit.\" \"You can always be thinner,\" I mumble, staring at the traffic in the street, distracted by something - what? I don\u0027t know. \"Look... better.\" \"Well, maybe we shouldn\u0027t go out to dinner,\" she says, concerned. \"I don\u0027t want to ruin your... willpower.\" \"No. It\u0027s all right,\" I say. \"I\u0027m not... very good at controlling it anyway.\" \"Patrick, seriously. I\u0027ll do whatever you want,\" she says. \"If you don\u0027t want to go to dinner, we won\u0027t. I mean - \" \"It\u0027s okay,\" I stress. Something snaps. \"You shouldn\u0027t fawn over him...\" I pause before correcting myself. \"I mean... me. Okay?\" \"I just want to know what you want to do,\" she says. \"To live happily ever after, right?\" I say sarcastically. \"That\u0027s what I want.\" I stare at her hard, for maybe half a minute, before turning away. This quiets her. After a while she orders a beer. It\u0027s hot out on the street. \"Come on, smile,\" she urges sometime later. \"You have no reason to be so sad.\" \"I know,\" I sigh, relenting. \"But it\u0027s.. tough to smile. These days. At least I find it hard to. I\u0027m not used to it, I guess. I don\u0027t know.\" \"That\u0027s... why people need each other,\" she says gently, trying to make eye contact while spooning the not inexpensive sorbet into her mouth. \"Some don\u0027t.\" I clear my throat self-consciously. \"Or, well, people compensate... They adjust...\" After a long pause, \"People can get accustomed to anything, right?\" I ask. \"Habit does things to people.\" Another long pause. Confused, she says, \"I don\u0027t know. I guess... but one still has to maintain... a ratio of more good things than... bad in this world,\" she says, adding, \"I mean, right?\" She looks puzzled, as if she finds it strange that this sentence has come out of her mouth. A blast of music from a passing cab, Madonna again, \"life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone...\" Startled by the laughter at the table next to ours, I c**k my head and hear someone admit, \"Sometimes what you wear to the office makes all the difference,\" and then Jean says something and I ask her to repeat it. \"Haven\u0027t you ever wanted to make someone happy?\" she asks. \"What?\" I ask, trying to pay attention to her. \"Jean?\" Shyly, she repeats herself. \"Haven\u0027t you ever wanted to make someone happy?\" I stare at her, a cold, distant wave of fright washes over me, dousing something. I clear my throat again and, trying to speak with great purposefulness, tell her, \"I was at Sugar Reef the other night... that Caribbean place on the Lower East Side... you know it - \" \"Who were you with?\" she interrupts. Jeanette. \"Evan McGlinn.\" \"Oh.\" She nods, silently relieved, believing me. ..Anyway...\" I sigh, continuing, \"I saw some guy in the men\u0027s room... a total... Wall Street guy... wearing a one-button viscose, wool and nylon suit by... Luciano Soprani... a cotton shirt by... Gitman Brothers... a silk tie by Ermenegildo Zegna and, I mean, I recognized the guy, a broker, named Eldridge... I\u0027ve seen him at Harry\u0027s and Au Bar and DuPlex and Alex Goes to Camp... all the places, but... when I went in after him, I saw... he was writing... something on the wall above the... urinal he was standing at.\" I pause, take a swallow of her beer. \"When he saw me come in... he stopped writing... put away the Mont Blanc pen... he zipped up his pants... said Hello, Henderson to me... checked his hair in the mirror, coughed... like he was nervous or... something and... left the room.\" I pause again, another swallow. \"Anyway... I went over to use the... urinal and... I leaned over... to read what he... wrote.\" Shuddering, I slowly wipe my forehead with a napkin. \"Which was?\" Jean asks cautiously. I close my eyes, three words fall from my mouth, these lips: \" \u0027Kill... All... Yuppies.\u0027\" She doesn\u0027t say anything. To break the uncomfortable silence that follows, I mention all I can come up with, which is, \"Did you know that Ted Bundy\u0027s first dog, a collie, was named Lassie?\" Pause. \"Had you heard this?\" Jean looks at her dish as if it\u0027s confusing her, then back up at me. \"Who\u0027s... Ted Bundy?\" \"Forget it,\" I sigh.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-159.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
