I get back on the other line.\n \"Bateman, Bateman, Bateman, Bateman, \" Hamlin is droning.\n \"I\u0027m here. Shut the f**k up.\"\n \"Are we still procrastinating?\" McDermott asks. \"Don\u0027t procrastinate.\"\n \"I\u0027ve decided I\u0027d rather play golf,\" I say. \"I haven\u0027t been golfing in a long time.\"\n \"Fuck golf, Batsman,\" Hamlin says. \"We have a nine o\u0027clock reservation at Kaktus - \"\n \"And a reservation to cancel at 1500 in, um, let\u0027s see... twenty minutes ago, Batsman,\" McDermott says.\n \"Oh shit, Craig. Cancel them now,\" I say tiredly.\n \"God, I hate golf,\" Hamlin says, shuddering.\n \"You cancel them,\" McDermott says, laughing.\n \"What name are they under?\" I ask, not laughing, my voice rising.\n After a pause, McDermott says \"Carruthers\" softly.\n Hamlin and I burst out laughing.\n \"Really?\" I ask.\n \"We couldn\u0027t get into Zeus Bar,\" Hamlin says. \"So it\u0027s Kaktus.\"\n \"Hip,\" I say dejectedly. \"I guess.\"\n \"Cheer up.\" Hamlin chortles.\n My call waiting buzzes again and before I can even decide whether to take it or not, Hamlin makes up my mind for me. \"Now if you guys don\u0027t want to go to Kaktus - \"\n \"Wait, my call waiting,\" I say. \"Hold on.\"\n Jeanette is in tears. \"What aren\u0027t you capable of?\" she asks, sobbing. \"Just tell me what you are not capable of.\"\n \"Baby. Jeanette,\" I say soothingly. \"Listen, please. We\u0027ll be at Zeus Bar at ten. Okay?\"\n \"Patrick, please,\" she begs. \"I\u0027m okay. I just want to talk - \"\n \"I\u0027ll see you at nine or ten, whenever,\" I say. \"I\u0027ve gotta go. Hamlin and McDermott are on the other line.\"\n \"Okay.\" She sniffs, composing herself, clearing her throat. \"I\u0027ll see you there. I\u0027m really sor - \"\n I click back onto the other line. McDermott is the only one left.\n \"He got off,\" McDermott says. \"He\u0027ll see us at nine.\"\n \"Great,\" I murmur. \"I feel settled.\"\n \"Who was that?\"\n \"Jeanette,\" I say.\n I hear a faint click, then another one.\n \"Was that yours or mine?\" McDermott asks.\n \"Yours,\" I say, \"I think.\"\n \"Hold on.\"\n I wait, impatiently pacing the length of the kitchen. McDermott clicks back on.\n \"It\u0027s Van Patten,\" he says. \"I\u0027m putting him on three-way.\"\n Four more clicks.\n \"Hey Bateman,\" Van Patten cries out. \"Buddy. \"\n \"Mr. Manhattan,\" I say. \"I\u0027m acknowledging you.\"\n \"Hey, what\u0027s the correct way to wear a cummerbund?\" he asks.\n \"I already answered that twice today,\" I warn.\n The two of them start talking about whether or not Van Patten can get to Kaktus by nine and I\u0027ve stopped concentrating on the voices coming through the cordless phone and started watching instead, with growing interest, the rat I\u0027ve bought - I still have the mutant one that emerged from the toilet - in its new glass cage, heave what\u0027s left of its acid-ridden body halfway across the elaborate Habitrail system that sits on the kitchen table, where it attempts to drink from the water holder that I filled with poisoned Evian this morning. The scene seems too pitiful to me or not pitiful enough. I can\u0027t decide. A call-waiting noise takes me out of my mindless delirium and I tell Van Patten and McDermott to please hold.\n I click off, then pause before saying, \"You have reached the home of Patrick Bateman. Please leave a message after - \"\n \"Oh for god\u0027s sake, Patrick, grow up,\" Evelyn moans. \"Just stop it. Why do you insist on doing that? Do you really think you\u0027re going to get away with it?\"\n \"With what?\" I ask innocently. \"Protecting myself?\"\n \"With torturing me,\" she pouts.\n \"Honey,\" I say.\n \"Yes?\" she sniffs.\n \"You don\u0027t know what torture is. You don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about,\" I tell her. \"You really don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\"\n \"I don\u0027t want to talk about it,\" she says. \"It\u0027s over. Now, what are you doing for dinner tonight?\" Her voice softens. \"I was thinking maybe dinner at TDK at, oh, say ninish?\"\n \"I\u0027m eating at the Harvard Club by myself tonight,\" I say. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-135.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: \n Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
