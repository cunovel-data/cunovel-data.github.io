{"id":96556,"no":97,"title":"Page 97","content":"\"So you like this place?\" he asks, grinning.\\n\\n \"My... favorite,\" I joke through clenched teeth.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s order,\" he says, not looking at me, waving to a hardbody, who brings over two menus and a wine list while smiling appreciatively at Sean, who in turn ignores her totally. I open the menu and - damnit - it\u0027s not prix fixe, which means that Sean orders the lobster with caviar and peach ravioli as an appetizer and the blackened lobster with strawberry sauce as an entree-the two most expensive items on the menu. I order the quail sashimi with grilled brioche and the baby soft-shell crabs with grape jelly. A hardbody opens the bottle of Cristal and pours it into crystal tumblers, which I guess is supposed to be cool. After she leaves, Sean notices me staring at him in a vaguely disapproving manner.\\n\\n \"What?\" he asks.\\n\\n \"Nothing,\" I say.\\n\\n \"What... is... it... Patrick?\" He spaces the words out, obnoxiously.\\n\\n \"Lobster to start with? And for an entree?\"\\n\\n \"What do you want me to order? The Pringle Potato Chip appetizer?\"\\n\\n \"Two lobsters?\"\\n\\n \"These matchbooks are slightly larger than the lobster they serve here,\" he says. \"Besides, I\u0027m not that hungry.\"\\n\\n \"Even more of a reason.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll fax you an apology.\"\\n\\n \"Still, Sean.\"\\n\\n \"Rock \u0027n\u0027 roll - \"\\n\\n \"I know, I know, rock \u0027n\u0027 roll, deal with it, right?\" I say, holding up a hand while sipping the champagne. I wonder if it\u0027s not too late to ask one of the waitresses to bring a piece of cake over here with a candle in it just to embarrass the shit out of him, to put the little bastard in his place - but instead I put the glass down and ask, \"Listen, so, oh Jesus.\" I breathe in, then force out, \"What did you do today?\"\\n\\n \"Played squash with Richard Lindquist.\" He shrugs contemptuously. \"Bought a tuxedo.\"\\n\\n \"Nicholas Leigh and Charles Conroy want to know if you\u0027re going to the Hamptons this summer.\"\\n\\n \"Not if I can help it,\" he says, shrugging.\\n\\n A blond girl close enough to physical perfection, with big tits and a Les Miserables playbill in one hand, wearing a long rayon matte-jersey evening dress by Michael Kors from Bergdorf Goodman, Manolo Blahnik shoes and gold-plated chandelier earrings by Ricardo Siberno, stops by to say hello to Sean and though I would f**k this girl, Sean ignores her flirtatious manner and refuses to introduce me. During this encounter Sean is completely rude, yet the girl leaves smiling, raising a gloved hand. \"We\u0027ll be at Mortimer\u0027s. Later.\" He nods, staring at my water glass, then waves down a waiter and orders a Scotch, straight.\\n\\n \"Who was that?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"Some babe who went to Stephens.\"\\n\\n \"Where did you meet her?\"\\n\\n \"Playing pool at M.K.\" He shrugs.\\n\\n \"Is she a du Pont?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"Why? Do you want her number?\"\\n\\n \"No, I just wanted to know if she\u0027s a du Pont.\"\\n\\n \"She might be. I don\u0027t know.\" He lights another cigarette, a Parliament, with what looks like an eighteen-karat gold cigarette lighter from Tiffany\u0027s. \"She might be a friend of one of the du Ponts.\"\\n\\n I keep thinking of reasons why I\u0027m sitting here, right now, tonight, with Sean, at Dorsia, but none come to mind. Just this infinitely recurring zero floats into view. After dinner - the food is small but very good; Sean touches nothing - I tell him that I have to meet Andrea Rothmere at Nell\u0027s and if he wants espresso or dessert, he should order it now since I have to be downtown by midnight.\\n\\n \"Why rush?\" he asks. \"Nell\u0027s isn\u0027t that hip anymore.\"\\n\\n \"Well.\" I falter, quickly regain composure. \"We\u0027re just going to meet there. We\u0027re really going to\" - my mind races, lands on something - \"Chernoble.\" I take another sip of champagne from the tumbler.\\n\\n \"Big yawn. Really big yawn,\" he says, scanning the room.\\n\\n \"Or Contraclub East. I can\u0027t remember.\"\\n\\n \"Out. Stone Age. Prehistory.\" He laughs cynically.\\n\\n Tense pause. \"How would you know?\"\\n\\n \"Rock \u0027n\u0027 roll.\" He shrugs. \"Deal with it.\"\\n\\n \"Well, Sean where, do you go?\"\\n\\n Immediate answer. \"Petty\u0027s.\"\\n\\n \"Oh yes,\" I murmur, having forgotten that it was already open.\\n\\n He whistles something, smokes a cigarette.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re going to a party Donald Trump\u0027s having,\" I lie.\\n\\n \"Big fun. Very big fun.\"\\n\\n \"Donald\u0027s a nice guy. You should meet him,\" I say. \"I\u0027ll... introduce you to him.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-97.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
