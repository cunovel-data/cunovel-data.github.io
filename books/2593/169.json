{"id":96628,"no":169,"title":"Page 169","content":"On the TV screen in Harry\u0027s is The Patty Winters Show, which is now on in the afternoon and is up against Geraldo Rivera, Phil Donahue and Oprah Winfrey. Today\u0027s topic is Does Economic Success Equal Happiness? The answer, in Harry\u0027s this afternoon, is a roar of resounding \"Definitely,\" followed by much hooting, the guys all cheering together in a friendly way. On the screen now are scenes from President Bush\u0027s inauguration early this year, then a speech from former President Reagan, while Patty delivers a hard-to-hear commentary. Soon a tiresome debate forms over whether he\u0027s lying or not, even though we don\u0027t, can\u0027t, hear the words. The first and really only one to complain is Price, who, though I think he\u0027s bothered by something else, uses this opportunity to vent his frustration, looks inappropriately stunned, asks, \"How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?\"\\n\\n \"Oh Christ,\" I moan. \"What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I\u0027m not really hungry but I would like to have reservations somewhere. How about 220?\" An afterthought: \"McDermott, how did that rate in the new Zagat\u0027s?\"\\n\\n \"No way,\" Farrell complains before Craig can answer. \"The coke I scored there last time was cut with so much laxative I actually had to take a shit in M.K.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, yeah, life sucks and then you die.\"\\n\\n \"Low point of the night,\" Farrell mutters.\\n\\n \"Weren\u0027t you with Kyria the last time you were there?\" Goodrich asks. \"Wasn\u0027t that the low point?\"\\n\\n \"She caught me on call waiting. What could I do?\" Farrell shrugs. \"I apologize.\"\\n\\n \"Caught him on call waiting.\" McDermott nudges me, dubious.\\n\\n \"Shut up, McDermott,\" Farrell says, snapping Craig\u0027s suspenders. \"Date a beggar.\"\\n\\n \"You forgot something, Farrell,\" Preston mentions. \"McDermott is a beggar.\"\\n\\n \"How\u0027s Courtney?\" Farrell asks Craig, leering.\\n\\n \"Just say no.\" Someone laughs.\\n\\n Price looks away from the television screen, then at Craig, and he tries to hide his displeasure by asking me, waving at the TV, \"I don\u0027t believe it. He looks so... normal. He seems so... out of it. So... un dangerous.\"\\n\\n \"Bimbo, bimbo,\" someone says. \"Bypass, bypass.\"\\n\\n \"He is totally harmless, you geek. Was totally harmless. Just like you are totally harmless. But he did do all that shit and you have failed to get us into 150, so, you know, what can I say?\" McDermott shrugs.\\n\\n \"I just don\u0027t get how someone, anyone, can appear that way yet be involved in such total shit,\" Price says, ignoring Craig, averting his eyes from Farrell. He takes out a cigar and studies it sadly. To me it still looks like there\u0027s a smudge on Price\u0027s forehead.\\n\\n \"Because Nancy was right behind him?\" Farrell guesses, looking up from the Quotrek. \"Because Nancy did it?\"\\n\\n \"How can you be so f**king, I don\u0027t know, cool about it?\" Price, to whom something really eerie has obviously happened, sounds genuinely perplexed. Rumor has it that he was in rehab.\\n\\n \"Some guys are just born cool, I guess.\" Farrell smiles, shrugging.\\n\\n I\u0027m laughing at this answer since Farrell is so obviously uncool, and Price shoots me a reprimanding look, says, \"And Bateman - what are you so f**king zany about?\"\\n\\n I shrug too. \"I\u0027m just a happy camper.\" And I add, remembering, quoting, my brother: \"Rocking and a rolling.\"\\n\\n \"Be all that you can be,\" someone adds.\\n\\n \"Oh brother.\" Price won\u0027t let it die. \"Look,\" he starts, trying for a rational appraisal of the situation. \"He presents himself as a harmless old codger. But inside...\" He stops. My interest picks up, flickers briefly. \"But inside...\" Price can\u0027t finish the sentence, can\u0027t add the last two words he needs:doesn\u0027t matter. I\u0027m both disappointed and relieved for him.\\n\\n \"Inside? Yes, inside?\" Craig asks, bored. \"Believe it or not, we\u0027re actually listening to you. Go on.\"\\n\\n \"Bateman,\" Price says, relenting slightly. \"Come on. What do you think?\"\\n\\n I look up, smile, don\u0027t say anything. From somewhere - the TV? - the national anthem plays. Why? I don\u0027t know. Before a commercial, maybe. Tomorrow, on The Patty Winters Show, Doormen from Nell\u0027s: Where Are They Now? I sigh, shrug, whatever.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s, uh, a pretty good answer.\" Price says, then adds, \"You\u0027re a real nut.\"\\n\\n \"That is the most valuable piece of information I\u0027ve heard since\" - I look at my new gold Rolex that insurance paid for - \"McDermott suggested we all drink dry beers. Christ, I want a Scotch.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-169.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
