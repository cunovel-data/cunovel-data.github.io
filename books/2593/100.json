Fuck the nigger on the wall...\u0027\" She falters again, then reads the last sentence, sighing. \" \u0027Black man... is... de... debil?\u0027\"\n The couple at the next table have slowly turned to gaze over at us. The man looks aghast, the woman has an equally horrified expression on her face. I stare her down, glaring, until she looks back at her f**king salad.\n \"Well, Patrick,\" Bethany says, clearing her throat, trying to smile, handing the paper back to me.\n \"Yes?\" I ask. \"Well?\"\n \"I can see that\" - she stops, thinking - \"that your sense of... social injustice is\" - she clears her throat again and looks down - \"still intact.\"\n I take the paper back from her and slip it in my pocket and smile, still trying to keep a straight face, holding my body upright so she won\u0027t suspect me of cringing. Our waiter comes over to the table and I ask him what kinds of beer they serve.\n \"Heineken, Budweiser, Amstel light,\" he recites.\n \"Yes?\" I ask, staring at Bethany, gesturing for him to continue.\n \"That\u0027s, um, all, sir,\" he says.\n \"No Corona? No Kirin? No Grolsch? No Morretti?\" I ask, confused, irate.\n \"I\u0027m sorry, sir, but no,\" he says cautiously. \"Only Heineken, Budweiser, Amstel Light.\"\n \"That\u0027s crazy,\" I sigh. \"I\u0027ll have a J\u0026B on the rocks. No, an Absolut martini. No, a J\u0026B straight up.\"\n \"And I\u0027ll have another San Pellegrino,\" Bethany says.\n \"I\u0027ll have the same thing;\" I quickly add, my leg jerking up then down uncontrollably beneath the table.\n \"Okay. Would you like to hear the specials?\" he asks.\n \"By all means,\" I spit out, then, calming down, smile reassuringly at Bethany.\n \"You\u0027re sure?\" He laughs.\n \"Please,\" I say, unamused, studying the menu.\n \"For appetizers I have the sun-dried tomatoes and golden caviar with poblano chilies and I also have a fresh endive soup - \"\n \"Wait a minute, wait a minute,\" I say, holding up a hand, stopping him. \"Hold on a minute.\"\n \"Yes sir?\" the waiter asks, confused.\n \"You have? You mean the restaurant has,\" I correct him. \"You don\u0027t have any sun-dried tomatoes. The restaurant does. You don\u0027t have the poblano chilies. The restaurant does. Just, you know, clarify.\"\n The waiter, stunned, looks at Bethany, who handles the situation deftly by asking him, \"So how is the endive soup served?\"\n \"Er... cold,\" the waiter says, not fully recovered from my outburst, sensing he\u0027s dealing with someone very, very on edge.\n He stops again, uncertain.\n \"Go on,\" I urge. \"Please go on.\"\n \"It\u0027s served cold,\" he starts again. \"And for entrees we have monkfish with mango slices and red snapper sandwich on brioche with maple syrup and\" - he checks his pad again - \"cotton.\"\n \"Mmmm, sounds delicious. Cotton, mmmm,\" I say, rubbing my hands together eagerly. \"Bethany?\"\n \"I\u0027ll have the ceviche with leeks and sorrel,\" Bethany says. \"And the endive with... walnut dressing.\"\n \"Sir?\" the waiter asks tentatively.\n \"I\u0027ll have... \" I stop, scan the menu quickly. \"I\u0027ll have the squid with pine nuts and can I have a slice of goat cheese, of chevre \" - I glance over at Bethany to see if she flinches at my mispronunciation - \"with that and some... oh, some salsa on the side.\"\n The waiter nods, leaves, we\u0027re left alone.\n \"Well.\" She smiles, then notices the table slightly shaking. \"What\u0027s... wrong with your leg?\"\n \"My leg? Oh.\" I look down at it, then back at her. \"It\u0027s... the music. I like the music a lot. The music that\u0027s playing.\"\n \"What is it?\" she asks, tilting her head, trying to catch a refrain of the New Age Muzak coming from the speakers hooked to the ceiling over the bar.\n \"It\u0027s... I think it\u0027s Belinda Carlisle,\" I guess. \"I\u0027m not sure.\"\n \"But...\" she starts, then stops. \"Oh, forget it.\"\n \"But what?\"\n \"But I don\u0027t hear any singing.\" She smiles, looks down demurely.\n I hold my leg still and pretend to listen. \"But it\u0027s one of her songs,\" I say, then lamely add, \"I think it\u0027s called \u0027Heaven Is a Place on Earth.\u0027 You know it.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-100.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: \n Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
