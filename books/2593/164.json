What\u0027s the story?\" I ask, again noticing the smudge on his forehead, though I get the feeling that if I asked someone else if it was truly there, he (or she) would just say no.\n He stands up, takes the card. \"I\u0027ve been back. You just probably missed me. Lost track. Because of the move.\" He pauses, teasingly. \"I\u0027m working for Robinson. Right-hand man, you know?\"\n \"Almond?\" I ask, offering one, a futile effort on my part to mask my dismay at his smugness.\n He pats my back, says, \"You\u0027re a madman, Batsman. An animal. A total animal.\"\n \"I can\u0027t disagree.\" I laugh weakly, walking him to the door. As he leaves I\u0027m wondering and not wondering what happens in the world of Tim Price, which is really the world of most of us: big ideas, guy stuff, boy meets the world, boy gets it.\n Bum on Fifth\n I\u0027m coming back from Central Park where, near the children\u0027s zoo, close to the spot I murdered the McCaffrey boy, I fed portions of Ursula\u0027s brain to passing dogs. Walking down Fifth Avenue around four o\u0027clock in the afternoon, everyone on the street looks sad, the air is full of decay, bodies lie on the cold pavement, miles of it, some are moving, most are not. History is sinking and only a very few seem dimly aware that things are getting bad. Airplanes fly low across the city, crossing in front of the sun. Winds shoot up Fifth, then funnel down Fifty-seventh Street. Flocks of pigeons rise in slow motion and burst up against the sky. The smell of burning chestnuts mixes with carbon monoxide fumes. I notice the skyline has changed only recently. I look up, admiringly, at Trump Tower, tall, proudly gleaming in the late afternoon sunlight. In front of it two smartass nigger teenagers are ripping off tourists at three-card monte and I have to fight the impulse to blow them away.\n A bum I blinded one spring sits cross-legged on a ratty blanket near the corner of Fifty-fifth Street. Moving closer I see the beggar\u0027s scarred face and then the sign he\u0027s holding beneath it, which reads VIETNAM VET BLINDED IN VIETNAM. PLEASE HELP ME. WE ARE HUNGRY AND HOMELESS. We? Then I notice the dog, who is already eyeing me suspiciously and, as I approach its master, gets up, growling, and when I\u0027m standing over the bum, it finally barks, wagging its tail frantically. I kneel down, threateningly raise a hand at it. The dog backs off, its paws askew.\n I\u0027ve pulled out my wallet, pretending to drop a dollar into his empty coffee can, but then realize: Why bother pretending? No one\u0027s watching anyway, definitely not him. I retract the dollar, leaning in. He senses my presence and stops shaking the can. The sunglasses he wears don\u0027t even begin to cover the wounds I inflicted. His nose is so junked up I can\u0027t imagine a person breathing through it.\n \"You never were in Vietnam,\" I whisper in his ear.\n After a silence, during which he pisses in his pants, the dog whimpering, he croaks, \"Please... don\u0027t hurt me.\"\n \"Why would I waste my time?\" I mutter, disgusted.\n I move away from the bum, noticing, instead, a little girl smoking a cigarette, begging for change outside Trump Tower. \"Shoo,\" I say. She says \"Shoo\" back. On The Patty Winters Show this morning a Cheerio sat in a very small chair and was interviewed for close to an hour. Later this afternoon, a woman wearing a silver fox and mink coat has her face slashed in front of the Stanhope by an enraged fur activist. But now, still staring at the sightless bum from across the street, I buy a Dove Bar, a coconut one, in which I find part of a bone.\n New Club\n Thursday night I run into Harold Carnes at a party for a new club called World\u0027s End that opens in a space where Petty\u0027s used to be on the Upper East Side. I\u0027m with Nina Goodrich and Jean in a booth and Harold\u0027s standing at the bar drinking champagne. I\u0027m drunk enough to finally confront him about the message I left on his machine. Excused from the booth, I make my way to the other side of the bar, realizing that I need a martini to fortify myself before discussing this with Cannes (it has been a very unstable week for me - I found myself sobbing during an episode of Alf on Monday). Nervously, I approach. Harold is wearing a wool suit by Gieves \u0026 Hawkes, a silk twill tie, cotton shirt, shoes by Paul Stuart; he looks heavier than I remember. \"Face it,\" he\u0027s telling Truman Drake, \"the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the \u002790s.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-164.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: \n Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
