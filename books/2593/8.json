Are you listening, Bateman?\" \"No he wasn\u0027 t,\" Evelyn says. \"Oh yes he was, but his name wasn\u0027t Stash last time. It was Horseshoe or Magnet or Lego or something equally adult,\" Price sneers. \"I forget.\" \"Timothy, what are you going on about?\" Evelyn asks tiredly. \"I\u0027m not even listening to you.\" She wets a cotton ball, wipes it across her forehead. \"No, we were at Odeon.\" Price sits up with some effort. \"And don\u0027t ask me why, but I distinctly remember him ordering the tuna cappuccino.\" \"Carpaccio,\" Evelyn corrects. \"No, Evelyn dear, love of my life. I distinctly remember him ordering the tuna cappuccino,\" Price says, staring up at the ceiling. \"He said carpaccio,\" she counters, running the cotton ball over her eyelids. \"Cappuccino,\" Price insists. \"Untilyou corrected him.\" \"You didn\u0027t even recognize him earlier tonight,\" she says. \"Oh but I do remember him,\" Price says, turning to me. \"Evelyn described him as \u0027the good-natured body builder.\u0027 That\u0027s how she introduced him. I swear.\" \"Oh shut up,\" she says, annoyed, but she looks over at Timothy in the mirror and smiles flirtatiously. \"I mean I doubt Stash makes the society pages of W, which I thought was your criterion for choosing friends,\" Price says, staring back, grinning at her in his wolfish, lewd way. I concentrate on the Absolut and cranberry I\u0027m holding and it looks like a glassful of thin, watery blood with ice and a lemon wedge in it. \"What\u0027s going on with Courtney and Luis?\" I ask, hoping to break their gaze. \"Oh god,\" Evelyn moans, turning back to the mirror. \"The really dreadful thing about Courtney is not that she doesn\u0027t like Luis anymore. It\u0027s that - \" \"They canceled her charge at Bergdorf\u0027s?\" Price asks. I laugh. We slap each other high-five. \"No,\" Evelyn continues, also amused. \"It\u0027s that she\u0027s really in love with her real estate broker. Some little twerp over at The Feathered Nest.\" \"Courtney might have her problems,\" Tim says, inspecting his recent manicure, \"but my god, what is a... Vanden?\" \"Oh don\u0027t bring this up,\" Evelyn whines and starts brushing her hair. \"Vanden is a cross between... The Limited and... used Benetton,\" Price says, holding up his hands, his eyes closed. \"No.\" I smile, trying to integrate myself into the conversation. \"Used Fiorucci.\" \"Yeah,\" Tim says. \"I guess.\" His eyes, now open, zone in on Evelyn. \"Timothy, lay off,\" Evelyn says. \"She\u0027s a Camden girl. What do you expect?\" \"Oh god,\" Timothy moans. \"I am so sick of hearing Camden -girl problems. Oh my boyfriend, I love him but he loves someone else and oh how I longed for him and he ignored me and blahblah blahblahblah - god, how boring. College kids. It matters, you know? It\u0027s sad, right Bateman?\" \"Yeah. Matters. Sad.\" \"See, Bateman agrees with me,\" Price says smugly. \"Oh he does not.\" With a Kleenex Evelyn wipes off whatever she rubbed on. \"Patrick is not a cynic, Timothy. He\u0027s the boy next door, aren\u0027t you honey?\" \"No I\u0027m not,\" I whisper to myself. \"I\u0027m a f**king evil psychopath.\" \"Oh so what,\" Evelyn sighs. \"She\u0027s not the brightest girl in the world.\" \"Hah! Understatement of the century!\" Price cries out. \"But Stash isn\u0027t the brightest guy either. Perfect couple. Did they meet on Love Connection or something?\" \"Leave them alone,\" Evelyn says. \"Stash is talented and I\u0027m sure we\u0027re under estimating Vanden.\" \"This is a girl...\" Price turns to me. \"Listen, Bateman, this is a girl - Evelyn told me this - this is a girl who rented High Noon because she thought it was a movie about\" - he gulps - \"marijuana farmers.\" \"It just hit me,\" I say. \"But have we deciphered what Stash - I assume he has a last name but don\u0027t tell me, I don\u0027t want to know, Evelyn - does for a living?\" \"First of all he\u0027s perfectly decent and nice,\" Evelyn says in his defense. \"The man asked for chocolate chip sorbet for Christ sakes!\" Timothy wails, disbelieving. \"What are you talking about?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-8.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
