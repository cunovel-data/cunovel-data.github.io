{"id":96624,"no":165,"title":"Page 165","content":"Relieved that Harold is, as usual, still dispensing valuable and new information, with the addition of a faint but unmistakable trace of, god forbid, an English accent, I find myself brazen enough to blurt out, \"Shut up, Carnes, they will not.\" I down the martini, Stoli, while Cannes, looking quite taken aback, stricken almost, turns around to face me, and his bloated head breaks out into an uncertain smile. Someone behind us is saying, \"But look what happened to Gekko...\" Truman Drake pats Harold on the back and asks me, \"Is there one suspender width that\u0027s more, well, appropriate than others?\" Irritably I push dim into the crowd and he disappears. \"So Harold,\" I say, \"did you get my message?\" Carnes seems confused at first and, while lighting a cigarette, finally laughs. \"Jesus, Davis. Yes, that was hila rious. That was you, was it?\" \"Yes, naturally.\" I\u0027m blinking, muttering to myself, really, waving his cigarette smoke away from my face. \"Bateman killing Owen and the escort girl?\" He keeps chuckling. \"Oh that\u0027s bloody marvelous. Really key, as they say at the Groucho Club. Really key.\" Then, looking dismayed, he adds, \"It was a rather long message, no?\" I\u0027m smiling idiotically and then I say, \"But what exactly do you mean, Harold?\" Secretly thinking to myself that this fat bastard couldn\u0027t possibly have gotten into the f**king Groucho Club, and even if he had, to admit it in such a fashion obliterates the fact that his entrance was accepted. \"Why, the message you left.\" Carnes is already looking around the club, waving to various people and bimbos. \"By the way, Davis, how is Cynthia?\" He accepts a glass of champagne from a passing waiter. \"You\u0027re still seeing her, right?\" \"But wait, Harold. What-do-you-mean?\" I repeat emphatically. He\u0027s already bored, neither concerned nor listening, and excusing himself, says, \"Nothing. Good to see you. Oh my, is that Edward Towers?\" I crane my neck to look, then turn back to Harold. \"No,\" I say. \"Carnes? Wait.\" \"Davis,\" he sighs, as if patiently trying to explain something to a child, \"I am not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman\u0027s such a bloody ass-kisser, such a brown-nosing goody-goody, that I couldn\u0027t fully appreciate it. Otherwise it was amusing. Now let\u0027s have lunch, or we\u0027ll have dinner at 150 Wooster or something with McDermott or Preston. A real raver.\" He tries to move on. \"Ray-vah? Ray-vah? Did you say ray-vah, Carnes?\" I\u0027m wide-eyed, feeling wired even though I haven\u0027t done any drugs. \"What are youtalking about? Bateman is what?\" \"Oh good god, man. Why else would Evelyn Richards dump him? You know, really. He could barelypick up an escort girl, let alone... what was it you said he did to her?\" Harold is still looking distractedly around the club and he waves to another couple, raising his champagne glass. \"Oh yes, \u0027chop her up.\u0027\" He starts laughing again, though this time it sounds polite. \"Now if you\u0027ll excuse me, I must really.\" \"Wait. Stop,\" I shout, looking up into Carnes\u0027 face, making sure he\u0027s listening. \"You don\u0027t seem to understand. You\u0027re not really comprehending any of this.I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I chopped Owen\u0027s f**king head off. I tortured dozens of girls. That whole message I left on your machine was true.\" I\u0027m drained, not appearing calm, wondering why this doesn\u0027t feel like a blessing to me. \"Excuse me,\" he says, trying to ignore my outburst. \"I really must be going.\" \"No!\" I shout. \"Now, Carnes. Listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I-killed-Paul-Owen-and-I-liked-it. I can\u0027t make myself any clearer.\" My stress causes me to choke on the words. \"But that\u0027s simply not possible,\" he says, brushing me off. \"And I\u0027m not finding this amusing anymore.\" \"It never was supposed to be!\" I bellow, and then, \"Why isn\u0027t it possible?\" \"It\u0027s just not,\" he says, eyeing me worriedly. \"Why not?\" I shout again over the music, though there\u0027s really no need to, adding \"You stupid bastard.\" He stares at me as if we are both underwater and shouts back, very clearly over the din of the club, \"Because... I had... dinner... with Paul Owen... twice... in London... just ten days ago.\" After we stare at each other for what seems like a minute, I finally have the nerve to say something back to him but my voice lacks any authority and I\u0027m not sure if I believe myself when I tell him, simply, \"No, you... didn\u0027t.\" But it comes out a question, not a statement.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-165.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
