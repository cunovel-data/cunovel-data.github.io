{"id":96581,"no":122,"title":"Page 122","content":"\"Oh god,\" Elizabeth starts, moaning as if she falsely remembered something embarrassing. \"I met Patrick at, oh god, the Kentucky Derby in \u002786 - no, \u002787, and...\" She turns to me. \"You were hanging out with that bimbo Alison something... Stoole?\" \"Poole, honey,\" I reply calmly. \"Alison Poole.\" \"Yeah, that was her name,\" she says, then with unmasked sarcasm, \"Hot number.\" \"What do you mean by that?\" I ask, offended. \"She was a hot number.\" Elizabeth turns to Christie and unfortunately says, \"if you had an American Express card she\u0027d give you a blow job,\" and I\u0027m hoping to god that Christie doesn\u0027t look over at Elizabeth, confused, and say \"But we don\u0027t take credit cards.\" To make sure this doesn\u0027t happen, I bellow \"Oh, bullshit,\" but goodnaturedly. \"Listen,\" Elizabeth tells Christie, holding her hand out like a fag offering gossipy information. \"This girl worked at a tanning salon, and\" - and in the same sentence, without changing tone - \"what do you do?\" After a long silence, Christie turning redder and even more scared, I say, \"She\u0027s... my cousin.\" Slowly, Elizabeth takes this in and says, \"Uh-huh?\" After another long silence, I say, \"She\u0027s... from France.\" Elizabeth looks at me skeptically - like I\u0027m completely crazy but chooses not to pursue this line of questioning and asks instead, \"Where\u0027s your phone? I\u0027ve got to call Harley.\" I move over to the kitchen and bring the cordless phone to her, pulling up its antenna. She dials a number and, while waiting for someone to answer, stares at Christie. \"Where do yo u summer?\" she asks. \"southampton?\" Christie looks at me and then back at Elizabeth and quietly says, \"No.\" \"Oh god,\" Elizabeth wails, \"it\u0027s his machine.\" \"Elizabeth.\" I point at my Rolex. \"It\u0027s three in the morning.\" \"He\u0027s a goddamn drug dealer,\" she says, exasperated \"These are his peak hours.\" \"Don\u0027t tell him you\u0027re here,\" I warn. \"Why would I?\" she asks. Distracted, she reaches for her wine and downs another full glass and makes a face. \"This tastes weird.\" She checks the label, then shrugs. \"Harley? It\u0027s me. I need your services. Translate that any way you\u0027d like. I\u0027m at - \" She looks over at me. \"You\u0027re at Marcus Halberstam\u0027s,\" I whisper. \"Who?\" Leaning in, she grins mischievously. \"Mar-cus Hal-ber-stam,\" I whisper again. \"I want the number, idiot.\" She waves me away and continues, \"Anyway, I\u0027m at Mark Hammerstein\u0027s and I\u0027ll try you later and if I don\u0027t see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I\u0027m going to sic my hairdresser on you. Bon voyage. How do I hang this thing up?\" she asks, even though she expertly pushes the antenna down and presses the Off button, tossing the phone onto the Schrager chair that I\u0027ve moved next to the jukebox. \"See.\" I smile. \"You did it.\" Twenty minutes later Elizabeth is squirming on the couch and I\u0027m trying to coerce her into having sex with Christie in front of me. What started out as a casual suggestion is now at the forefront of my brain and I\u0027m insistent. Christie stares impassively at a stain I hadn\u0027t noticed on the white-oak floor, her wine mostly untouched. \"But I\u0027m not a lesbian,\" Elizabeth protests again, giggling. \"I\u0027m not into girls.\" \"Is this afirm no?\" I ask, staring at her glass, then at the near-empty bottle of wine. \"Why\u0027d you think I\u0027d be intothat?\" she asks. Because of the Ecstasy, the question is flirtatious and she seems genuinely interested. Her foot is rubbing against my thigh. I\u0027ve moved over to the couch, sitting between the two girls, and I\u0027m massaging one of her calves. \"Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing,\" I tell her. \"You never know.\" \"Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick,\" she points out, giggling rubbing harder, causing friction, heat, everything. \"Well, I\u0027m sorry: \" I admit. \"I don\u0027t usually deal with a lot of guys who wear panty hose on the Street.\" \"Patrick, you went to Patrick, I mean, Harvard, oh god, I\u0027m so drunk. Anyway, listen. I mean, wait - \" She pauses, taken a deep breath, mumbles an unintelligible remark about feeling bizarre, then, after closing her eyes, opens them and asks, \"Do you have any coke?\" I\u0027m staring at her glass, noticing that the dissolved Ecstasy has slightly changed the color of the wine. She follows my gaze and takes a gulp of it as if it were some kind of elixir that could soothe her increasing agitation. She leans her head back, woozily, on one of the pillows on the couch. \"Or Halcion. I\u0027d take a Halcion.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-122.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
