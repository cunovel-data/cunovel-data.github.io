{"id":96570,"no":111,"title":"Page 111","content":"\"Two at nine?\" I say. \"Perfect.\" \"There are no tables available tonight,\" the maitre d\u0027, unflappable, drones. \"The waiting list is also totally booked.\" He hangs up. \"See you then.\" I hang up too, and with a smile that tries its best to express pleasure at her choice, I find myself fighting for breath, every muscle tensed sharply. Jean is wearing a wool jersey and flannel dress by Calvin Klein, an alligator belt with a silver buckle by Barry Kieselstein Cord, silver earrings and clear stockings also by Calvin Klein. She stands there in front of the desk, confused. \"Yes?\" I ask, walking over to the coatrack. \"You\u0027re dressed... okay.\" She pauses. \"You didn\u0027t give them a name,\" she says softly. I think about this while putting on my Armani jacket and while reknotting my Armani silk tie, and without stammering I tell her, \"They... know me.\" While the maitre d\u0027 seats a couple who I\u0027m pretty sure are Kate Spencer and Jason Lauder, Jean and I move up to his podium, where the reservation book lies open, names absurdly legible, and leaning over it casually I spot the only name for two at nine without a line drawn through it, which happens to be - oh Jesus - Schrawtz. I sigh, and tapping my foot, my mind racing, I try to concoct some kind of feasible plan. Suddenly I turn to Jean and say, \"Why don\u0027t you go to the women\u0027s room.\" She\u0027s looking around the restaurant, taking it in. Chaos People are waiting ten deep at the bar. The maitre d\u0027 seats the couple at a table in the middle of the room. Sylvester Stallone and a bimbo sit in the front booth that Sean and I sat in just weeks before, much to my sickened amazement, and his bodyguards are piled into the booth next to that, and the owner of Petty\u0027s, Norman Prager, lounges in the third. Jean turns her head to me and shouts \"What?\" over the din. \"Don\u0027t you want to use the ladies\u0027 room?\" I ask. The maitre d\u0027 nears us, picking his way through the packed restaurant, unsmiling. \"Why? I mean... do I?\" she asks, totally confused. \u0027Just... go,\" I hiss, desperately squeezing her arm. \"But I don\u0027t need to go, Patrick,\" she protests. \"Oh Christ,\" I mutter. Now it\u0027s too late anyway. The maitre d\u0027 walks up to the podium and inspects the book, takes a phone call, hangs up in a matter of seconds, then looks us over, not exactly displeased. The maitre d\u0027 is at least fifty and has a ponytail. I clear my throat twice to get his full attention, make some kind of lame eye contact. \"Yes?\" he asks, as if harassed. I give him a dignified expression before sighing inside. \"Reservations at nine...\" I gulp. \"For two.\" \"Ye-e-es?\" he asks suspiciously, drawing the word out. \"Name?\" he says, then turns to a passing waiter, eighteen and model handsome, who\u0027d asked, \"Where\u0027s da ice?\" He\u0027s glaring and shouting, \"Not... now. Okay? How many times do you need to be told?\" The waiter shrugs, humbly, and then the maitre d\u0027 points off toward the bar, \"Da ice is over dere!\" He turns back to us and I am genuinely frightened. \"Name,\" he commands. And I\u0027m thinking: Of all the f**king names, why this one? \"Um, Schrawtz\" - oh god - \"Mr. and Mrs. Schrawtz.\" My face, I\u0027m sure, is ashen and I say the name mechanically, but the maitre d\u0027 is too busy to not buy it and I don\u0027t even bother to face Jean, who I\u0027m sure is totally bewildered by my behavior as we\u0027re led to the Schrawtzes\u0027 table, which I\u0027m sure probably sucks though I\u0027m relieved anyway. Menus already lie on the table but I\u0027m so nervous the words and even the prices look like hieroglyphics and I\u0027m completely at a loss. A waiter takes our drink order - the same one who couldn\u0027t locate the ice - and I find myself saying things, without listening to Jean, like \"Protecting the ozone layer is a really cool idea\" and telling knock-knock jokes. I smile, fixing it on my face, in another country, and it takes no time at all - minutes, really, the waiter doesn\u0027t even get a chance to tell us about the specials - for me to notice the tall, handsome couple by the podium conferring with the maitre d\u0027, and after sighing very deeply, light-headed, stammering, I mention to Jean, \"Something bad is happening.\" She looks up from the menu and puts down the iceless drink she\u0027s been sipping. \"Why? What\u0027s wrong?\" The maitre d\u0027 is glaring over at us, at me, from across the room as he leads the couple toward our table. If the couple had been short, dumpy, excessively Jewish, I could\u0027ve kept this table, even without the aid of a fifty, but this couple looks like they\u0027ve just strolled out of a Ralph Lauren ad, and though Jean and I do too (and so does the rest of the whole goddamn restaurant), the man is wearing a tuxedo and the girl - a totally f**kable babe - is covered with jewels. This is reality, and as my loathsome brother Sean would say, I have to deal with it. The maitre d\u0027 now stands at the table, hands clasped behind his balk, unamused, and after a long pause asks, \"Mr. and Mrs... Schrawtz?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-111.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
