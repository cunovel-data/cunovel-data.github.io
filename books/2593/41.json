{"id":96500,"no":41,"title":"Page 41","content":"\"It\u0027s called California classic cuisine,\" Scott is telling me.\n \"Why don\u0027t we all go to Zeus Bar next week?\" Anne suggests to Scott. \"You think we\u0027d have a problem getting a table on Friday?\" Scott is wearing a red and purple and black striped cashmere intarsia sweater from Paul Stuart, baggy Ralph Lauren corduroys and Cole-Haan leather moccasins.\n \"Well... maybe,\" he says.\n \"That\u0027s a good idea. I like it a lot,\" Anne says, picking up a small violet off her plate and sniffing the flower before placing it carefully on her tongue. She\u0027s wearing a red, purple and black hand-knitted mohair and wool sweater from Koos Van Den Akker Couture and slacks from Anne Klein, with suede open-toe pumps.\n A waiter, though not the hardbody, strides over to take another drink order.\n \"J\u0026B. Straight,\" I say before anyone else orders.\n Courtney orders a champagne on the rocks, which secretly appalls me. \"Oh,\" she says as if reminded by something, \"can I have that with a twist?\"\n \"A twist of what?\" I ask irritably, unable to stop myself. \"Let me guess. Melon?\" And I\u0027m thinking oh my god why didn\u0027t you return those goddamn videos Bateman you dumb son-of-a-bitch.\n \"You mean lemon, miss,\" the waiter says, giving me an icy stare.\n \"Yes, of course. Lemon.\" Courtney nods, seeming lost in some kind of dream but enjoying it, oblivious to it.\n \"I\u0027ll have a glass of the... oh gosh, I guess the Acacia,\" Scott says and then addresses the table: \"Do I want a white? Do I really want a chardonnay? We can eat the redfish with a cabernet.\"\n \"Go for it,\" Anne says cheerily.\n \"Okay, I\u0027ll have the... oh jeez, the sauvignon blanc,\" Scott says.\n The waiter smiles, confused.\n \"Scottie,\" Anne shrieks. \"The sauvignon blanc?\"\n \"Just teasing,\" he snickers. \"I\u0027ll have the chardonnay. The Acacia.\"\n \"You complete jerk.\" Anne smiles, relieved. \"You\u0027re fun ny.\"\n \"I\u0027m having the chardonnay,\" Scott tells the waiter.\n \"That\u0027s nice,\" Courtney says, patting Scott\u0027s hand.\n \"I\u0027ll just have...\" Anne stalls, deliberating. \"Oh, I\u0027ll just have a Diet Coke.\"\n Scott looks up from a piece of corn bread he was dipping into a small tin of olive oil. \"You\u0027re not drinking tonight?\"\n \"No,\" Anne says, smiling naughtily. Who knows why? And who f**king cares? \"I\u0027m not in the mood.\"\n \"Not even for a glass of the chardonnay?\" Scott asks. \"How about a sauvignon blanc?\"\n \"I have this aerobics class at nine,\" she says, slipping, losing control. \"I really shouldn\u0027t.\"\n \"Well then, I don\u0027t want anything,\" Scott says, disappointed. \"I mean I have one at eight at Xclusive.\"\n \"Does anyone want to guess where I won\u0027t be tomorrow morning at eight?\" I ask.\n \"No, honey. I know how much you like the Acacia.\" Anne reaches out and squeezes Scott\u0027s hand.\n \"No, babe. I\u0027ll stick to the Pellegrino,\" Scott says, pointing.\n I\u0027m tapping my fingers very loudly on the tabletop, whispering \"shit, shit, shit, shit\" to myself. Courtney\u0027s eyes are half closed and she\u0027s breathing deeply.\n \"Listen. I\u0027ll be daring,\" Anne says finally. \"I\u0027ll have a Diet Coke with rum.\"\n Scott sighs, then smiles, beaming really. \"Good.\"\n \"That\u0027s a caffeine-fine Diet Coke, right?\" Anne asks the waiter.\n \"You know,\" I interrupt, \"you should have it with Diet Pepsi. It\u0027s much better.\"\n \"Really?\" Anne asks. \"What do you mean?\"\n \"You should have the Diet Pepsi instead of the Diet Coke,\" I say. \"It\u0027s much better. It\u0027s fizzier. It has a cleaner taste. It mixes better with rum and has a lower sodium content.\"\n The waiter, Scott, Anne, and even Courtney - they all stare at me as if I\u0027ve offered some kind of diabolical, apocalyptic observation, as if I were shattering a myth highly held, or destroying an oath that was solemnly regarded, and it suddenly seems almost hushed in Deck Chairs. Last night I rented a movie called Inside Lydia\u0027s Ass and while on two Halcion and in fact sipping a Diet Pepsi, I watched as Lydia - a totally tan bleached-blonde hardbody with a perfect ass and great full tits - while on all fours gave head to this guy with a huge c**k while another gorgeous blonde little hardbody with a perfectly trimmed blond pu**y knelt behind Lydia and after eating her ass out and sucking on her cunt started to push a long, greased silver vibrator into Lydia\u0027s ass and f**ked her with it while she continued to eat her pu**y and the guy with the huge c**k came all over Lydia\u0027s face as she sucked his balls and then Lydia bucked to an authentic-looking, fairly strong orgasm and then the girl behind Lydia crawled around and licked the come from Lydia\u0027s face and then made Lydia suck on the vibrator. The new Stephen Bishop came out last Tuesday and at Tower Records yesterday I bought the compact disc, the cassette and the album because I wanted to own all three formats. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-41.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: \n Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
