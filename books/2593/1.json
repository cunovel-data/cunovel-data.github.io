{"id":96460,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"Chapter One April Fools Abandon all hope ye who enter here is scrawled in blood red lettering on the side of the Chemical Bank near the corner of Eleventh and First and is in print large enough to be seen from the backseat of the cab as it lurches forward in the traffic leaving Wall Street and just as Timothy Price notices the words a bus pulls up, the advertisement for Les Miserables on its side blocking his view, but Price who is with Pierce \u0026 Pierce and twenty-six doesn\u0027t seem to care because he tells the driver he will give him five dollars to turn up the radio, \"Be My Baby\" on WYNN, and the driver, black, not American, does so. \"I\u0027m resourceful,\" Price is saying. \"I\u0027m creative, I\u0027m young, unscrupulous, highly motivated, highly skilled. In essence what I\u0027m saying is that society cannot afford to lose me. I\u0027m an asset.\" Price calms down, continues to stare out the cab\u0027s dirty window, probably at the word FEAR sprayed in red graffiti on the side of a McDonald\u0027s on Fourth and Seventh. \"I mean the fact remains that no one gives a shit about their work, everybody hates their job, I hate my job, you\u0027ve told me you hate yours. What do I do? Go back to Los Angeles? Not an alternative. I didn\u0027t transfer from UCLA to Stanford to put up with this. I mean am I alone in thinking we\u0027re not making enough money?\" Like in a movie another bus appears, another poster for Les Miserables replaces the word - not the same bus because someone has written the word DYKE over Eponine\u0027s face. Tim blurts out, \"I have a co-op here. I have a place in the Hamptons, for Christ sakes.\" \"Parents\u0027, guy. It\u0027s the parents\u0027.\" \"I\u0027m buying it from them. Will you f**king turn this up?\" he snaps but distractedly at the driver, the Crystals still blaring from the radio. \"It don\u0027t go up no higher,\" maybe the driver says. Timothy ignores him and irritably continues. \"I could stay living in this city if they just installed Blaupunkts in the cabs. Maybe the ODM III or ORC II dynamic tuning systems?\" His voice softens here. \"Either one. Hip my friend, very hip.\" He takes off the expensive-looking Walkman from around his neck, still complaining. \"I hate to complain - I really do - about the trash, the garbage, the disease, about how filthy this city really is and you know and I know that it is a sty ...\" He continues talking as he opens his new Tumi calfskin attache case he bought at D. F. Sanders. He places the Walkman in the case alongside a Panasonic wallet-size cordless portable folding Easa-phone (he used to own the NEC 9000 Porta portable) and pulls out today\u0027s newspaper. \"In one issue - in one issue - let\u0027s see here... strangled models, babies thrown from tenement rooftops, kids killed in the subway, a Communist rally, Mafia boss wiped out, Nazis\" - he flips through the pages excitedly - \"baseball players with AIDS, more Mafia shit, gridlock, the homeless, various maniacs, faggots dropping like flies in the streets, surrogate mothers, the cancellation of a soap opera, kids who broke into a zoo and tortured and burned various animals alive, more Nazis... and the joke is, the punch line is, it\u0027s all in this city - nowhere else, just here, it sucks, whoa wait, more Nazis, gridlock, gridlock, baby-sellers, black-market babies, AIDS babies, baby junkies, building collapses on baby, maniac baby, gridlock, bridge collapses - \" His voice stops, he takes in a breath and then quietly says, his eyes fixed on a beggar at the corner of Second and Fifth, \"That\u0027s the twenty-fourth one I\u0027ve seen today. I\u0027ve kept count.\" Then asks without looking over, \"Why aren\u0027t you wearing the worsted navy blue blazer with the gray pants?\" Price is wearing a six-button wool and silk suit by Ermenegildo Zegna, a cotton shirt with French cuffs by Ike Behar, a Ralph Lauren silk tie and leather wing tips by Fratelli Rossetti. Pan down to the Post. There is a moderately interesting story concerning two people who disappeared at a party aboard the yacht of a semi-noted New York socialite while the boat was circling the island. A residue of spattered blood and three smashed champagne glasses are the only clues. Foul play is suspected and police think that perhaps a machete was the killer\u0027s weapon because of certain grooves and indentations found on the deck. No bodies have been found. There are no suspects. Price began his spiel today over lunch and then brought it up again during the squash game and continued ranting over drinks at Harry\u0027s where he had gone on, over three J\u0026Bs and water, much more interestingly about the Fisher account that Paul Owen is handling. Price will not shut up. \"Diseases!\" he exclaims, his face tense with pain. \"There\u0027s this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone whois infected then you can also catch any thing, whether it\u0027s a virus per se or not - Alzheimer\u0027s, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, anorexia, diabetes, cancer, multiple sclerosis, cystic fibrosis, cerebral palsy, dyslexia, for Christ sakes - you can get dyslexia from pu**y - \"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-1.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
