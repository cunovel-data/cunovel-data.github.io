{"id":96497,"no":38,"title":"Page 38","content":"From my POV Paul Owen sits at a table across the room with someone who looks a lot like Trent Moore, or Roger Daley, and some other guy who looks like Frederick Connell. Moore\u0027s grandfather owns the company he works at. Trent is wearing a mini-houndstooth-check worsted wool suit with multicolored overplaid. \"Nekenieh?\" Hamlin asks. \"What\u0027s Nekenieh?\" \"Guys, guys,\" I say. \"Who\u0027s sitting with Paul Owen over there? Is that Trent Moore?\" \"Where?\" Reeves. \u0027They\u0027re getting up. That table,\" I say. \"Those guys.\" \"Isn\u0027t that Madison? No, it\u0027s Dibble,\" Reeves says. He puts on his clear prescription eyeglasses just to make sure. \"No,\" Hamlin says. \"It\u0027s Trent Moore.\" \"Are you sure?\" Reeves asks. Paul Owen stops by our table on his way out. He\u0027s wearing sunglasses by Persol and he\u0027s carrying a briefcase by Coach Leatherware. \"Hello, men,\" Owen says and he introduces the two guys he\u0027s with, Trent Moore and someone named Paul Denton. Reeves and Hamlin and I shake their hands without standing up. George and Todd start talking to Trent, who is from Los Angeles and knows where Nekenieh is located. Owen turns his attention my way, which makes me slightly nervous. \"How have you been?\" Owen asks. \"I\u0027ve been great,\" I say. \"And you?\" \"Oh terrific,\" he says. \"How\u0027s the Hawkins account going?\" \"It\u0027s...\" I stall and then continue, faltering momentarily, \"It\u0027s... all right.\" \"Really?\" he asks, vaguely concerned. \"That\u0027s interesting,\" he says, smiling, hands clasped together behind his back. \"Not great?\" \"Oh well,\" I say. \"You... know.\" \"And how\u0027s Marcia?\" he asks, still smiling, looking over the room, not really listening to me. \"She\u0027s a great girl.\" \"Oh yes,\" I say, shaken. \"I\u0027m... lucky.\" Owen has mistaken me for Marcus Halberstam (even though Marcus is dating Cecelia Wagner) but for some reason it really doesn\u0027t matter and it seems a logical faux pas since Marcus works at P \u0026 P also, in fact does the same exact thing I do, and he also has a penchant for Valentino suits and clear prescription glasses and we share the same barber at the same place, the Pierre Hotel, so it seems understandable; it doesn\u0027t irk me. But Paul Denton keeps staring at me, or trying not to, as if he knows something, as if he\u0027s not quite sure if he recognizes me or not, and it makes me wonder if maybe he was on that cruise a long time ago, one night last March. If that\u0027s the case, I\u0027m thinking, I should get his telephone number or, better yet, his address. \"Well, we should have drinks,\" I tell Owen. \"Great,\" he says. \"Let\u0027s. Here\u0027s my card.\" \"Thanks,\" I say, looking at it closely, relieved by its crudeness, before slipping it into my jacket. \"Maybe I\u0027ll bring...\" I pause, then carefully say, \"Marcia?\" \"That would be great,\" he says. \"Hey, have you been to that Salvadorian bistro on Eighty-third?\" he asks. \"We\u0027re eating there tonight.\" \"Yeah. I mean no,\" I say. \"But I\u0027ve heard it\u0027s quite good.\" I smile weakly and take a sip of my drink. \"Yes, so have I.\" He checks his Rolex. \"Trent? Denton? Let\u0027s split. Reservation\u0027s in fifteen.minutes.\" Goodbyes are said and on their way out of Harry\u0027s they stop by the table Dibble and Hamilton are sitting at, or at least I think it\u0027s Dibble and Hamilton. Before they leave, Denton looks over at our table, at me, one last time, and he seems panicked, convinced of something by my presence, as if he recognized me from somewhere, and this, in turn, freaks me out. \"The Fisher account,\" Reeves says. \"Oh shit,\" I say. \"Don\u0027t remind us.\" \"Lucky bastard,\" Hamlin says. \"Has anyone seen his girlfriend?\" Reeves asks. \"Laurie Kennedy? Total hardbody.\" \"I know her,\" I say, admit, \"I knew her.\" \"Why do you say it like that?\" Hamlin asks, intrigued. \"Why does he say it like that, Reeves?\" \"Because he dated her,\" Reeves says casually. \"How did you know that?\" I ask, smiling. \"Girls dig Bateman.\" Reeves sounds a little drunk. \"He\u0027s GQ. You\u0027re total GQ, Bateman.\" \"Thanks guy, but...\" I can\u0027t tell if he\u0027s being sarcastic but it makes me feel proud in a way and I try to downplay my good looks by saying, \"She\u0027s got a lousy personality.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-38.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
