Are people having problems with their conditioners or something? Am I missing something? What were we talking about?\"\n \"No, that\u0027s absolutely wrong. It\u0027s Science Equals Death.\" I sigh, close my eyes. \"Jesus, Evelyn, only you could confuse that and a hair product.\" I have no idea what the hell I\u0027m saying but I nod, waving to someone at the bar, an older man, his face covered in shadow, someone I only half know, actually, but he manages to raise his champagne glass my way and smile back, which is a relief.\n \"Who\u0027s that?\" I hear Evelyn asking.\n \"He\u0027s a friend of mine,\" I say.\n \"I don\u0027t recognize him,\" she says. \"P \u0026 P?\"\n \"Forget it,\" I sigh.\n \"Who is it, Patrick?\" she asks, more interested in my reluctance than in an actual name.\n \"Why?\" I ask back.\n \"Who is it?\" she asks. \"Tell me.\"\n \"A friend of mine,\" I say, teeth gritted.\n \"Who, Patrick?\" she asks, then, squinting, \"Wasn\u0027t he at my Christmas party?\"\n \"No, he was not,\" I say, my hands drumming the tabletop.\n \"Isn\u0027t it... Michael J. Fox?\" she asks, still squinting. \"The actor?\"\n \"Hardly,\" I say, then, fed up, \"Oh for Christ sakes, his name is George Levanter and no, he didn\u0027t star in The Secret of My Success.\"\n \"Oh how interesting.\" Already Evelyn is back poring over the menu. \"Now, what were we talking about?\"\n Trying to remember, I ask, \"Conditioners? Or some kind of conditioner?\" I sigh. \"I don\u0027t know. You were talking to the dwarf.\"\n \"Ian is not a midget, Patrick,\" she says.\n \"He is unusually short, Evelyn,\" I counter. \"Are you sure he wasn\u0027t at your Christmas party\" - and then, my voice lowered - \"serving hors d\u0027oeuvres?\"\n \"You cannot keep referring to Ian as a dwarf,\" she says, smoothing her napkin over her lap. \"I will not stand for it,\" she whispers, not looking at me.\n I can\u0027t restrain myself from snickering.\n \"It isn\u0027t funny, Patrick,\" she says.\n \"You cut the conversation short,\" I point out.\n \"Did you expect me to be flattered?\" she spits out bitterly.\n \"Listen, baby, I\u0027m just trying to make that encounter seem as legitimate as possible, so don\u0027t, uh, you know, screw it up for yourself.\"\n \"Just stop it,\" she says, ignoring me. \"Oh look, it\u0027s Robert Farrell.\" After waving to him, she discreetly points him out to me and sure enough, Bob Farrell, whom everyone likes, is sitting on the north side of the room at a window table, which secretly drives me mad. \"He\u0027s very good-looking,\" Evelyn confides admiringly, only because she\u0027s noticed me contemplating the twenty-year-old hardbody he\u0027s sitting with, and to make sure I\u0027ve registered this she teasingly chirps, \"Hope I\u0027m not making you jealous.\"\n \"He\u0027s handsome,\" I admit. \"Stupid-looking but handsome.\"\n \"Don\u0027t be nasty. He\u0027s very handsome,\" she says and then suggests, \"Why don\u0027t you get your hair styled that way?\"\n Before this comment I was an automaton, only vaguely paying attention to Evelyn, but now I\u0027m panicked, and I ask, \"What\u0027s wrong with my hair?\" In a matter of seconds my rage quadruples. \"What the hell is wrong with my hair?\" I touch it lightly.\n \"Nothing,\" she says, noticing how upset I\u0027ve gotten. \"Just a suggestion,\" and then, really noticing how flushed I\u0027ve become, \"Your hair looks really... really great.\" She tries to smile but only succeeds in looking worried.\n A sip - half a glass - of the J\u0026B calms me enough to say, looking over at Farrell, \"Actually, I\u0027m horrified by his paunch.\"\n Evelyn studies Farrell too. \"Oh, he doesn\u0027t have a paunch.\"\n \"That\u0027s definitely a paunch,\" I say. \"Look at it.\"\n \"That\u0027s just the way he\u0027s sitting,\" she says, exasperated. \"Oh you\u0027re - \"\n \"It\u0027s a paunch, Evelyn,\" I stress.\n \"Oh you\u0027re crazy.\" She waves me off. \"A lunatic.\"\n \"Evelyn, the man is barely thirty.\"\n \"So what? Everyone\u0027s not into weight lifting like you,\" she says, annoyed, looking back at the menu.\n \"I do not \u0027weight lift,\u0027\" I sigh.\n \"Oh go over and sock him in the nose, then, you big bully,\" she says, brushing me off. \"I really don\u0027t care.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-142.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: \n Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
