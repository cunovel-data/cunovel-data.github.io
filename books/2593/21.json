{"id":96480,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"\"What\u0027s wrong?\" I say, looking up from my plate, a fork poised over it, but my hand will not move; it\u0027s as if it appreciated the plate\u0027s setup too much, as if my hand had a mind of its own and refused to break up its design. I sigh and put the fork down, hopeless. \"Shit. I have to tape this movie on cable for Mandy.\" He wipes his mouth with a napkin, stands up. \"I\u0027ll be back.\" \"Have her do it, idiot,\" Price says. \"What are you, demented?\" \"She\u0027s in Boston, seeing her den tist.\" Van Patten shrugs, pu**ywhipped. \"What in the hell are you going to do?\" My voice wavers. I\u0027m still thinking about Van Patten\u0027s card. \"Call up HBO?\" \"No;\" he says. \"I have a touch-tone phone hooked up to program a Videonics VCR programmer I bought at Hammacher Schlemmer.\" He walks away pulling his suspenders up. \"How hip,\" I say tonelessly. \"Hey, what do you want for dessert?\" McDermott calls out. \"Something chocolate and flourless,\" he shouts back. \"Has Van Patten stopped working out?\" I ask. \"He looks puffy.\" \"It looks that way, doesn\u0027t it,\" Price says. \"Doesn\u0027t he have a membership at the Vertical Club?\" I ask. \"I don\u0027t know,\" Price murmurs, studying his plate, then sitting up he pushes it away and motions to the waitress for another Finlandia on the rocks. Another hardbody waitress approaches us tentatively, bringing over a bottle of champagne, Perrier-Jouet, nonvintage, and tells us it\u0027s complimentary from Scott Montgomery. \"Nonvintage, that weasel,\" Price hisses, craning his neck to find Montgomery\u0027s table. \"Loser.\" He gives him a thumbs-up sign from across the room. \"The f**ker\u0027s so short I could barely see him. I think I gave thumbs-up to Conrad. I can\u0027t be sure.\" \"Where\u0027s Conrad?\" I ask. \"I should say hello to him.\" \"The dude who called you Hamilton,\" Price says. \"That wasn\u0027t Conrad,\" I say. \"Are you sure? It looked a helluva lot like him,\" he says but he\u0027s not really listening; he blatantly stares at the hardbody waitress, at exposed cle**age as she leans down to get a firmer grip on the bottle\u0027s cork. \"No. That wasn\u0027t Con rad,\" I say, surprised at Price\u0027s inability to recognize co-workers. \"That guy had a better haircut.\" We sit in silence while the hardbody pours the champagne. Once she leaves, McDermott asks if we liked the food. I tell him the potpie was fine but there was way too much tomatillo sauce. McDermott nods, says, \"That\u0027s what I\u0027ve heard.\" Van Patten returns, mumbling, \"They don\u0027t have a good bathroom to do coke in.\" \"Dessert?\" McDermott suggests. \"Only if I can order the Bellini sorbet,\" Price says, yawning. \"How about just the check,\" Van Patten says. \"Time to go bird-dogging, gentlemen,\" I say. The hardbody brings the check over. The total is $475, much less than we expected. We split it but I need the cash so I put it on my platinum AmEx and collect their bills, mostly fresh fifties. McDermott demands ten dollars back since his scallop sausage appetizer was only sixteen bucks. Montgomery\u0027s bottle of champagne is left at the table, undrunk. Outside Pastels a different bum sits in the street, with a sign that says something completely illegible. He gently asks us for some change and then, more hopefully, for some food. \"That dude needs a facial real bad,\" I say. \"Hey McDermott,\" Price cackles. \"Throw him your tie.\" \"Oh shit. What\u0027s that gonna get him?\" I ask, staring at the bum. \"Appetizers at Jams.\" Van Patten laughs. He gives me high-five. \"Dude,\" McDermott says, inspecting his tie, clearly offended. \"Oh, sorry... cab,\" Price says, waving down a cab. \"... and a beverage.\" \"Off to Tunnel,\" McDermott tells the driver. \"Great, McDermott,\" Price says, getting in the front seat. \"You sound really excited.\" \"So what if I\u0027m not some burned-out decadent faggot like yourself,\" McDermott says, getting in ahead of me. \"Did anyone know cavemen got more fiber than we do?\" Price asks the cabdriver. \"Hey, I heard that too,\" McDermott says. \"Van Patten,\" I say. \"Did you see the comp bottle of champagne Montgomery sent over?\" \"Really?\" Van Patten asks, leaning over McDermott. \"Let me guess. Perrier-Jouet?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-21.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
