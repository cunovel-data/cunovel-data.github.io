{"id":96555,"no":96,"title":"Page 96","content":"\"Something bad? Like what?\" I asked, trying to concentrate on the numbers sliding across my monitor while simultaneously waving Jean away, even though she was holding a sheaf of papers I was supposed to sign. \"That all Michelob breweries in the Northeast are closing? That 976-BIMBO has stopped making house calls?\" \"No,\" Charles said, then quietly mentioned, \"Tell him your mother is... worse.\" I mulled over this tactic, then said, \"He might not care.\" \"Tell him...\" Nicholas paused, then cleared his throat and rather delicately proposed, \"it has to do with her estate.\" I looked up from the monitor, lowering my Wayfarer aviator sunglasses, and stared at Jean, then lightly fingered the Zagat guide that sat next to the monitor. Pastels would be impossible. Ditto Dorsia. Last time I called Dorsia someone had actually hung up on me even before I asked, \"Well, if not next month, how about January?\" and though I have vowed to get a reservation at Dorsia one day (if not during this calendar year, then at least before I\u0027m thirty), the energy I would spend attempting this feat isn\u0027t worth wasting on Sean. Besides, Dorsia\u0027s far too chic for him. I want to make him endure this dinner; to not be allowed the pleasure of being distracted by hardbodies on their way to Nell\u0027s; somewhere with a men\u0027s room attendant so he would have to be painfully subtle about what is now, I\u0027m sure, his chronic cocaine usage. I handed the Zagat to Jean and asked her to find the most expensive restaurant in Manhattan. She made a nine o\u0027clock reservation at the Quilted Giraffe. \"Things are worse at Sandstone,\" I tell Sean later this afternoon, around four o\u0027clock. He\u0027s staying in our father\u0027s suite at the Carlyle. MTV is blasting in the background, other voices shout over its din. I can hear a shower running. \"Like what? Mom ate her pillow? What?\" \"I think we should have dinner,\" I say. \"Dominique, cool it,\" he says, then places his hand over the phone and mutters something, muffled. \"Hello, Sean? What\u0027s going on?\" I\u0027m asking. \"I\u0027ll call back,\" he says, hanging up. I happen to like the tie I bought Sean at Paul Smith last week and I\u0027ve decided not to give it to him (though the idea of the ass**le, say; hanging himself with it pleases me greatly). In fact I decide to wear it to the Quilted Giraffe tonight. Instead of the tie, I\u0027m going to bring him a Casio QD-150 Quick-Dialer combination wristwatch, calculator and data bank. It dials touch-tone phones sonically when held up to a mouthpiece and it stores up to fifty names and numbers. I start laughing while putting this useless gift back into its box, thinking to myself that Sean doesn\u0027t even have fifty acquaintances. He couldn\u0027t even name fifty people. The Patty Winters Show this morning was about Salad Bars. Sean calls at five from the Racquet Club and tells me to meet him at Dorsia tonight. He just talked to Brin, the owner, and reserved a table at nine. My mind is a mess. I don\u0027t know what to think or how to feel. The Patty Winters Show this morning was about Salad Bars. Later. Dorsia, nine-thirty: Sean is half an hour late. The maitre d\u0027 refuses to seat me until my brother arrives. My worst fear - a reality. A prime booth across from the bar sits there, empty, waiting for Sean to grace it with his presence. My rage is controlled, barely, by a Xanax and an Absolut on the rocks. While taking a piss in the men\u0027s room, I stare into a thin, weblike crack above the urinal\u0027s handle and think to myself that if I were to disappear into that crack, say somehow miniaturize and slip into it, the odds are good that no one would notice I was gone. No... one... would... care. In fact some, if they noticed my absence, might feel an odd, indefinable sense of relief. This is true: the world is better off with some people gone. Our lives are not all interconnected. That theory is a crock. Some people truly do not need to be here. In fact one of them, my brother, Sean, is sitting in the booth he reserved when I come out of the men\u0027s room after I\u0027ve phoned the apartment and checked for messages (Evelyn\u0027s suicidal, Courtney wants to buy a chow, Luis suggests dinner on Thursday). Sean is already chain-smoking, and I\u0027m thinking to myself.Damn, why didn\u0027t I request a table in the nonsmoking section? He\u0027s shaking hands with the maitre d\u0027 as I walk over but doesn\u0027t even bother to introduce us. I sit down and nod. Sean nods too, having already ordered a bottle of Cristal, knowing that I\u0027m paying; also knowing, I\u0027m sure, that I know he doesn\u0027t drink champagne. Sean, who is now twenty-three, went to Europe last fall, or at least this is what Charles Conroy said Sean told him, and though Charles did receive a substantial bill from the Plaza Athenee, the signature on the receipts didn\u0027t match Sean\u0027s and no one really seemed to know how long Sean was actually in France or even if he had spent real time there. Afterwards he bummed around, then reenrolled at Camden for about three weeks. Now he\u0027s in Manhattan before flying to either Palm Beach or New Orleans. Predictably, tonight he\u0027s alternately moody and insistently arrogant. He has also, I\u0027ve just noticed, started to pluck his eyebrows. He no longer has only one. The overwhelming urge I have to mention this to him is quelled only by squeezing my hand into a fist so tightly that I break the skin on the palm of my hand and the biceps of my left arm bulges then rips through the cloth of the linen Armani shirt I have on.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-96.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
