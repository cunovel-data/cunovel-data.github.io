Elves? Patrick you\u0027re confusing me,\" Evelyn says. \"And I don\u0027t appreciate it.\" \"Let\u0027s go.\" I\u0027m squeezing her roughly, pulling her toward the back door. \"Let\u0027s be daring for once. For just once in your life, Evelyn, be daring.\" She stops, refusing to be pulled along, and then she starts smiling, considering my offer but only slightly won over. \"Come on...\" I start whining. \"Let this be my Christmas present.\" \"Oh ho, I was already at Brooks Brothers and - \" she starts. \"Stop it. Come on, I want this,\" I say and then in a last, desperate attempt I smile flirtatiously, kissing her lightly on the lips, and add, \"Mrs. Batsman?\" \"Oh Patrick,\" she sighs, melting. \"But what about cleanup?\" \"The midgets\u0027ll do it,\" I assure her. \"But someone has to oversee it, honey.\" \"So choose an elf. Make that one over there the elf overseer,\" I say. \"But let\u0027s go, now.\" I start pulling her toward the back door of the brownstone, her shoes squeaking as they slide across the Muscoli marble tile. And then we\u0027re out the door, rushing down the alley adjacent to the brownstone, and I stop and peer around the corner to see if anyone we know is leaving or entering the party. We make a run for a limousine I think is Owen\u0027s, but I don\u0027t want to make Evelyn suspicious so I simply walk up to the closest one, open the door and push her in. \"Pat rick,\" she squeals, pleased. \"This is so naughty. And a limo - \" I close the door on her and walk around the car and knock on the driver\u0027s window. The driver unrolls it. \"Hi,\" I say, holding out a hand. \"Pat Bateman.\" The driver just stares, an unlit cigar clenched in his mouth, first at my outstretched hand; then at my face, then at the top of my head. \"Pat Bateman,\" I repeat. \"What, ah, what is it?\" He keeps looking at me. Tentatively I touch my hair to see if it\u0027s messed up or out of place and to my shock and surprise I feel two pairs of paper antlers. There are four antlers on my f**king head. I mutter, \"Oh Jesus, whoa!\" and tear them off, staring at them crumpled in my hands, horrified. I throw them on the ground, then turn back to the driver. \"So. Pat Bateman,\" I say, smoothing my hair back into place. \"Uh, yeah? Sid.\" He shrugs. \"Listen, Sid. Mr. Owen says we can take this car, so...\" I stop, my breath steaming in the frozen air. \"Who\u0027s Mr. Owen?\" Sid asks. \"Paul Owen. You know,\" I say. \"Your customer.\" \"No. This is Mr. Barker\u0027s limo,\" he says. \"Nice antlers though.\" \"Shit,\" I say, running around the limo to get Evelyn out of there before something bad happens, but it\u0027s too late. The second I open the door, Evelyn sticks her head out and squeals, \"Patrick, darling, I love it. Champagne \" - she holds up a bottle of Cristal in one hand and a gold box in the other - \"and truffles too.\" I grab her arm and yank her out, mumbling by way of an explanation, under my breath, \"Wrong limo, take the truffles,\" and we head over to the next limousine. I open the door and guide Evelyn in, then move around to the front and knock on the driver\u0027s window. He unrolls it. He looks exactly like the other driver. \"Hi. Pat Batsman, \" I say, holding out my hand. \"Yeah? Hi. Donald Trump. My wife Ivana\u0027s in the back,\" he says sarcastically, taking it. \"Hey, watch it,\" I warn. \"Listen, Mr. Owen says we can take his car. I\u0027m... oh damn. I mean I\u0027m Marcus.\" \"You just said your name was Pat.\" \"No. I was wrong,\" I say sternly, staring directly at him. \"I was wrong about my name being Pat. My name is Marcus. Marcus Halberstam.\" \"Now you\u0027re sure of this, right?\" he asks. \"Listen, Mr. Owen said I can take his car for the night, so...\" I stop. \"You know, let\u0027s just get on with it.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-80.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
