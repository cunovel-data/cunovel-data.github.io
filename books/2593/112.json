His ponytail, gray and oily, hangs like some kind of malignancy below his collar.\\n\\n \"You know,\" I finally say, somewhat suavely, \"I happen to know the chef.\"\\n\\n He continues staring. So, no doubt, does the couple behind him.\\n\\n After another long pause, for no real reason, I ask, \"Is he... in Aspen?\"\\n\\n This is getting nowhere. I sigh and turn to Jean, who looks completely mystified. \"Let\u0027s go, okay?\" She nods dumbly. Humiliated, I take Jean\u0027s hand and we get up - she slower than I - brushing past the maitre d\u0027 and the couple, and make our way back through the crowded restaurant and then we\u0027re outside and I\u0027m utterly devastated and murmuring robotically to myself \"I should have known better I should have known better I should,\" but Jean skips down the street laughing, pulling me along, and when I finally notice her unexpected mirth, between giggles she lets out \"That was so funny\" and then, squeezing my clenched fist, she lets me know \"Your sense of humor is so spontaneous.\" Shaken, walking stiffly by her side, ignoring her, I ask myself \"Where... to... now?\" and in seconds come up with an answer - Arcadia, toward which I find myself guiding us.\\n\\n After someone who I think is Hamilton Conway mistakes me for someone named Ted Owen and asks if I can get him into Petty\u0027s tonight - I tell him, \"I\u0027ll see what I can do,\" then turn what\u0027s left of my attention to Jean, who sits across from me in the near-empty dining room of Arcadia - after he leaves, only five of the restaurant\u0027s tables have people at them. I\u0027ve ordered a J\u0026B on the rocks. Jean\u0027s sipping a glass of white wine and talking about how what she really wants to do is \"get into merchant banking\" and I\u0027m thinking: Dare to dream. Someone else, Frederick Dibble, stops by and congratulates me on the Larson account and then has the nerve to say, \"Talk to you later; Saul.\" But I\u0027m in a daze, millions of miles away, and Jean doesn\u0027t notice; she\u0027s talking about a new novel she\u0027s been reading by some young author - its cover, I\u0027ve seen, slathered with neon; its subject, lofty suffering. Accidentally I think she\u0027s talking about something else and I find myself saying, without really looking over at her, \"You need a tough skin to survive in this city.\" She flushes, seems embarrassed and takes another sip of the wine, which is a nice sauvignon blanc.\\n\\n \"You seem distant,\" she says.\\n\\n \"What?\" I ask, blinking.\\n\\n \"I said you seem distant,\" she says.\\n\\n \"No,\" I sigh. \"I\u0027m still my same kooky self.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s good.\" She smiles - am I dreaming this? - relieved.\\n\\n \"So listen,\" I say, trying to focus in on her, \"what do you really want to do with your life?\" Then, remembering how she was droning on about a career in merchant banking, I add, \"Just briefly, you know, summarize.\" Then I add, \"And don\u0027t tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?\"\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027d like to travel,\" she says. \"And maybe go back to school, but I really don\u0027t know...\" She pauses thoughtfully and announces, sincerely, \"I\u0027m at a point in my life where there seems to be a lot of possibilities, but I\u0027m so... I don\u0027t know... unsure.\"\\n\\n \"I think it\u0027s also important for people to realize their limitations.\" Then, out of the blue I ask, \"Do you have a boyfriend?\"\\n\\n She smiles shyly, blushes, and then says, \"No. Not really.\"\\n\\n \"Interesting,\" I murmur. I\u0027ve opened my menu and I\u0027m studying tonight\u0027s prix fixe dinner.\\n\\n \"Are you seeing anyone?\" she ventures timidly. \"I mean, seriously?\"\\n\\n I decide on the pilot fish with tulips and cinnamon, evading the question by sighing, \"I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special,\" and before she\u0027s allowed to respond I ask her what she\u0027s going to order.\\n\\n \"I think the mahi-mahi,\" she says and then, squinting at the menu, \"with ginger.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m having the pilot fish,\" I say. \"I\u0027m developing a taste for them. For... pilot fish,\" I say, nodding.\\n\\n Later, after a mediocre dinner, a bottle of expensive California cabernet sauvignon and a crime brulee that we share, I order a glass of fifty-dollar port and Jean sips a decaffeinated espresso and when she asks where the restaurant got its name, I tell her, and I don\u0027t make anything ridiculous up - though I\u0027m tempted, just to see if she\u0027d believe it anyway. Sitting across from Jean right now in the darkness of Arcadia, it\u0027s very easy to believe that she would swallow any kind of misinformation I push her way - the crush she has on me rendering her powerless - and I find this lack of defense oddly unerotic. I could even explain my pro-apartheid stance and have her find reasons why she too should share them and invest large sums of money in racist corporations tha- \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-112.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
