I want a chick who\u0027s gonna let me - \"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to hear this,\" Van Patten says, clamping his hands over his ears. \"He\u0027s going to say something disgusting.\"\\n\\n \"You prude,\" McDermott sneers. \"Listen, we\u0027re not gonna invest in a co-op together or jet down to Saint Bart\u0027s. I just want some chick whose face I can sit on for thirty, forty minutes.\"\\n\\n I throw my swizzle stick at him.\\n\\n \"Anyway, so we\u0027re back at my place and listen to this.\" He moves in closer to the table. \"She\u0027s had enough champagne by now to get a f**king rhino tipsy, and get this - \"\\n\\n \"She let you f**k her without a condom?\" one of us asks.\\n\\n McDermott rolls his eyes up. \"This is a Vassar girl. She\u0027s not from Queens.\"\\n\\n Price taps me on the shoulder. \"What does that mean?\"\\n\\n \"Anyway, listen,\" McDermott says. \"She would... are you ready?\" He pauses dramatically. \"She would only give me a hand job, and get this... she kept her glove on.\" He sits back in his chair and sips his drink in a smug, satisfied sort of way.\\n\\n We all take this in solemnly. No one makes fun of McDermott\u0027s revelatory statement or of his inability to react more aggressively with this chick. No one says anything but we are all thinking the same thought: Never pick up a Vassar girl.\\n\\n \"What you need is a chick from Camden,\" Van Patten says, after recovering from McDermott\u0027s statement.\\n\\n \"Oh great,\" I say. \"Some chick who thinks it\u0027s okay to f**k her brother.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, but they think AIDS is a new band from England,\" Price points out.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s dinner?\" Van Patten asks, absently studying the question scrawled on his napkin. \"Where the f**k are we going?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s really funny that girls think guys are concerned with that, with diseases and stuff,\" Van Patten says, shaking his head.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not gonna wear a f**king condom,\" McDermott announces.\\n\\n \"I have read this article I\u0027ve Xeroxed,\" Van Patten says, \"and it says our chances of catching that are like zero zero zero zero point half a decimal percentage or something, and this no matter what kind of scumbag, slutbucket, horndog chick we end up boffing.\"\\n\\n \"Guys just cannot get it.\"\\n\\n \"Well, not white guys.\"\\n\\n \"This girl was wearing a f**king glove?\" Price asks, still shocked. \"A glove? Jesus, why didn\u0027t you just jerk off instead?\"\\n\\n \"Listen, the dick also rises,\" Van Patten says. \"Faulkner.\"\\n\\n \"Where did you go to college?\" Price asks. \"Pine Manor?\"\\n\\n \"Men,\" I announce: \"Look who approaches.\"\\n\\n \"Who?\" Price won\u0027t turn his head.\\n\\n \"Hint,\" I say. \"Biggest weasel at Drexel Burnham Lambert.\"\\n\\n \"Connolly?\" Price guesses.\\n\\n \"Hello, Preston,\" I say, shaking Preston\u0027s hand.\\n\\n \"Fellows,\" Preston says, standing over the table, nodding to everyone. \"I\u0027m sorry about not making dinner with you guys tonight.\" Preston is wearing a double-breasted wool suit by Alexander Julian, a cotton shirt and a silk Perry Ellis tie. He bends down, balancing himself by putting a hand on the back of my chair. \"I feel really bad about canceling, but commitments, you know.\"\\n\\n Price gives me an accusatory look and mouths \"Was he invited?\"\\n\\n I shrug and finish what\u0027s left of the J\u0026B.\\n\\n \"What did you do last night?\" McDermott asks, and then, \"Nice threads.\"\\n\\n \"Who did he do last night?\" Van Patten corrects.\\n\\n \"No, no,\" Preston says. \"Very respectable, decent evening. No babes, no blow, no brew. Went to The Russian Tea Room with Alexandra and her parents. She calls her father - get this - Billy. But I\u0027m so f**king tired and only one S toli.\" He takes off his glasses (Oliver Peoples, of course) and yawns, wiping them clean with an Armani handkerchief. \"I\u0027m not sure, but I think our like weird Orthodox waiter dropped some acid in the borscht. I\u0027m so f**king tired.\"\\n\\n \"What are you doing instead?\" Price asks, clearly uninterested.\\n\\n \"Have to return these videos, Vietnamese with Alexandra, a musical, Broadway, something British,\" Preston says, scanning the room.\\n\\n \"Hey Preston,\" Van Patten says. \"We\u0027re gonna send in the GQ questions. You got one?\"\\n\\n \"Oh yeah, I\u0027ve got one,\" Preston says. \"Okay, so when wearing a tuxedo how do you keep the front of your shirt from riding up?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-14.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
