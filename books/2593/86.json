Absolut. Double. No olive.\"\n \"Hurry,\" I call after him, then under my breath, watching as he waves gaily from the top of the stairs, \"Fucking moron.\"\n I turn back to the booth. Behind us, a table of Eurotrash hardbodies that suspiciously resemble Brazilian transvestites shriek in unison. Let\u0027s see... Saturday night I\u0027m going to a Mets game with Jeff Harding and Leonard Davis. I\u0027m renting Rambo movies on Sunday. The new Lifecycle will be delivered on Monday... I stare at the three models for an agonizing amount of time, minutes, before saying anything, noticing that someone has ordered a plate of papaya slices and someone else a plate of asparagus, though both remain untouched. Daisy carefully looks me over, then aims her mouth in my direction and blows smoke toward my head, exhaling, and it floats over my hair, missing my eyes, which are protected anyway by the Oliver Peoples nonprescription redwood-framed glasses I\u0027ve been wearing most of the night. Another one, Libby, the bimbo with jet lag, is trying to figure out how to unfold her napkin. My frustration level is surprisingly low, because things could be worse. After all, these could be English girls. We could be drinking... tea.\n \"So!\" I say, clapping my hands together, trying to seem alert. \"It was hot out today. No?\"\n \"Where did Greg go?\" Libby asks, noticing McDermott\u0027s absence.\n \"Well, Gorbachev is downstairs,\" I tell her. \"McDermott, Greg, is going to sign a peace treaty with him, between the United States and Russia.\" I pause, trying to gauge her reaction, before adding, \"McDermott\u0027s the one behind glasnost, you know.\"\n \"Well... yeah,\" she says, her voice impossibly toneless, nodding. \"But he told me he was in mergers and... aquasessions.\"\n I\u0027m looking over at Taylor, who\u0027s still sleeping. I snap one of his suspenders but there\u0027s no reaction, no movement, then I turn back to Libby. \"You\u0027re not confused, are you?\"\n \"No,\" she says, shrugging. \"Not really.\"\n \"Gorbachev\u0027s not downstairs,\" Caron says suddenly.\n \"Are you lying?\" Daisy asks, smiling.\n I\u0027m thinking: Oh boy. Yes. Caron\u0027s right. Gorbachev\u0027s not downstairs. He\u0027s at Tunnel. Excuse me. Waitress?\" I grab at a passing hardbody who\u0027s wearing a Bill Blass navy lace gown with a silk organza ruffle. \"I\u0027ll have a J\u0026B on the rocks and a butcher knife or something sharp from the kitchen. Girls?\"\n None of them say anything. The waitress is staring at Taylor. I look over at him, then back at the hardbody waitress, then back at Taylor. \"Bring him the, um, grapefruit sorbet and, oh, let\u0027s say, a Scotch, okay?\"\n The waitress just stares at him.\n \"Ahem, honey?\" I wave my hand in front of her face. \"J\u0026B? On the rocks?\" I tell her, enunciating over the jazz band, who are in the middle of a fine rendition of \"Take Five.\"\n She finally nods.\n \"And bring them\" - I gesture toward the girls - \"whatever it was they\u0027re drinking. Ginger ale? Wine cooler?\"\n \"No,\" Libby says. \"It\u0027s champagne.\" She points, then says to Caron, \"Right?\"\n \"I guess.\" Caron shrugs.\n \"With peach schnapps,\" Daisy reminds her.\n \"Champagne,\" I repeat, to the waitress. \"With, uh-huh, peach schnapps. Catch that?\"\n Waitress nods, writes something down, leaves, and I\u0027m checking out her ass as she walks away, then I look back at the three of them, studying each one very carefully for any signs, a flicker of betrayal that would cross their faces, the one gesture that would give away this robot act, but it\u0027s fairly dark in Nell\u0027s and my hope - that this is the case - is just wishful thinking and so I clap my hands together again and breathe in. \"So! It was really hot out today. Right?\"\n \"I need a new fur,\" Libby sighs, staring into her champagne\n \"Full length or ankle length?\" Daisy asks in the same tonelow voice.\n \"A stole?\" Caron suggests.\n \"Either a full length or...\" Libby stops and thinks hard for a minute. \"I saw this short, cuddly wrap...\"\n \"But mink, right?\" Daisy asks. \"Definitely mink?\"\n \"Oh yeah. Mink,\" Libby says.\n \"Hey Taylor,\" I whisper, nudging him. \"Wake up. They\u0027re talking. You\u0027ve gotta see this.\"\n \"But which kind?\" Caron\u0027s on a roll. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-86.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: \n Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
