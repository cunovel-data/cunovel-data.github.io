On the way back to my apartment I stop at D\u0027Agostino\u0027s, where for dinner I buy two large bottles of Perrier, a six-pack of Coke Classic, a head of arugula, five medium-sized kiwis, a bottle of tarragon balsamic vinegar, a tin of creme fraiche, a carton of microwave tapas, a box of tofu and a white-chocolate candy bar I pick up at the checkout counter. Once outside, ignoring the bum lounging below the Les Miserables poster and holding a sign that reads: I\u0027VE LOST MY JOB I AM HUNGRY I HAVE NO MONEY PLEASE HELP, whose eyes tear after I pull the tease-the-bum-with-a-dollar trick and tell him, \"Jesus, will you get a f**king shave, please,\" my eyes almost like they were guided by radar, focus in on a red Lamborghini Countach parked at the curb, gleaming beneath the streetlamps, and I have to stop moving, the Valium shockingly, unexpectedly kicking in, everything else becomes obliterated: the crying bum, the black kids on crack rapping along to the blaring beatbox, the clouds of pigeons flying overhead looking for space to roost, the ambulance sirens, the honking taxis, the decent-looking babe in the Betsey Johnson dress, all of that fades and in what seems like time-lapse photography but in slow motion, like a movie - the sun goes down, the city gets darker and all I can see is the red Lamborghini and all I can hear is my own even, steady panting. I\u0027m still standing, drooling, in front of the store, staring, minutes later (I don\u0027t know how many). Facial I leave the office at four-thirty, head up to Xclusive where I work out with free weights for an hour, then taxi across the park to Gio\u0027s in the Pierre Hotel for a facial, a manicure and, if time permits, a pedicure. I\u0027m lying on the elevated table in one of the private rooms waiting for Helga, the skin technician, to facialize me. My Brooks Brothers shirt and Garrick Anderson suit hang in the closet, my A. Testoni loafers sit on the floor, thirty-dollar socks from Barney\u0027s balled up in them, sixty-dollar boxer shorts from Comme des Gar\u0026ccedil;ons are the only article of clothing I\u0027m still wearing. The smock I\u0027m supposed to have on is crumpled next to the shower stall since I want Helga to check my body out, notice my chest, see how f**king buff my abdominals have gotten since the last time I was here, even though she\u0027s much older than I am - maybe thirty or thirty-five - and there\u0027s no way I\u0027d ever f**k her. I\u0027m sipping a Diet Pepsi that Mario, the valet, brought me, with crushed ice in a glass on the side that I asked for but don\u0027t want. I pick up today\u0027s Post that hangs from a Smithly Watson glass magazine rack and scan the gossip columns, then my eye catches a story about recent sightings of these creatures that seem to be part bird, part rodent - essentially pigeons with the heads and tails of rats - found deep in the center of Harlem and now making their way steadily toward midtown. A grainy photograph of one of these things accompanies the article, but experts, the Post assures us, are fairly certain this new breed is a hoax. As usual this fails to soothe my fear, and it fills me with a nameless dread that someone out there has wasted the energy and time to think this up: to fake a photograph (and do a half-assed job at that, the thing looks like a f**king Big Mac) and send the photograph in to the Post, then for the Post to decide to run the story (meetings, debates, last-minute temptations to cancel the whole thing?), to print the photograph, to have someone write about the photo and interview the experts, finally to run this story on page three in today\u0027s edition and have it discussed over hundreds of thousands of lunches in the city this afternoon. I close the paper and lie back, exhausted. The door to the private room opens and a girl I haven\u0027t seen before walks in and through half-closed eyes I can see that she\u0027s young, Italian, okay-looking. She smiles, sitting in a chair at my feet, and begins the pedicure. She switches off the ceiling light and except for strategically placed halogen bulbs shining down on my feet, hands and face, the room darkens, making it impossible to tell what kind of body she has, only that she\u0027s wearing gray suede and black leather buttoned ankle boots by Maud Frizon. The Patty Winters Show this morning was about UFOs That Kill. Helga arrives. \"Ah, Mr. Bateman,\" Helga says. \"How are you?\" \"Very good, Helga,\" I say, flexing the muscles in my stomach and chest. My eyes are closed so it looks casual, as, if the muscles are acting on their own accord and I can\u0027t help it. But Helga drapes the smock gently across my heaving chest and buttons it up, pretending to ignore the undulations beneath the tan, clean skin. \"You\u0027re back so soon,\" she says.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-49.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
