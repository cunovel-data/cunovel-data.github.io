{"id":96515,"no":56,"title":"Page 56","content":"He\u0027s fortyish, heavyset, and when he attempts to sit up I can make out his features more clearly in the glare of the streetlamp: a few days\u0027 growth of beard, triple chin, a ruddy nose lined with thick brown veins. He\u0027s dressed in some kind of tacky-looking lime green polyester pantsuit with washed-out Sergio Valente jeans worn over it (this season\u0027s homeless person\u0027s fashion statement) along with a ripped orange and brown V-neck sweater stained with what looks like burgundy wine. It seems he\u0027s very drunk - either that or he\u0027s crazy or stupid. His eyes can\u0027t even focus when I stand over him, blocking out the light from a streetlamp, covering him in shadow. I kneel down. \"Hello,\" I say, offering thy hand, the one the dog licked. \"Pat Baternan.\" The bum stares at me, panting with the exertion it takes to sit up. He doesn\u0027t shake my hand. \"You want some money?\" I ask gently. \"Some... food?\" The bum nods and starts to cry, thankfully. I reach into my pocket and pull out a ten-dollar bill, then change my mind and hold out a five instead. \"Is this what you need?\" The bum nods again and looks away, shamefully, his nose running, and after clearing his throat says quietly, \"I\u0027m so hungry.\" \"It\u0027s cold out, too,\" I say. \"Isn\u0027t it?\" \"I\u0027m so hungry.\" He convulses once, twice, a third time, then looks away, embarrassed. \"Why don\u0027t you get a job?\" I ask, the bill still held in my hand but not within the bum\u0027s reach. \"If you\u0027re so hungry, why don\u0027t you get a job?\" He breathes in, shivering, and between sobs admits, \"I lost my job...\" \"Why?\" I ask, genuinely interested. \"Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? just joking. No, really - were you drinking on the job?\" He hugs himself, between sobs, chokes, \"I was fired. I was laid off.\" I take this in, nodding. \"Gee, uh, that\u0027s too bad.\" \"I\u0027m so hungry,\" he says, then starts crying hard, still holding himself. His dog, the thing called Gizmo, starts whimpering. \"Why don\u0027t you get another one?\" I ask. \"Why don\u0027t you get another job?\" \"I\u0027m not...\" He coughs, holding himself, shaking miserably, violently, unable to finish the sentence. \"You\u0027re not what?\" I ask softly. \"Qualified for anything else?\" \"Tm hungry,\" he whispers. \"I know that, I know that,\" I say. \u0027Jeez, you\u0027re like a broken record. I\u0027m trying to help you...\" My impatience rises. \"I\u0027m hungry,\" he repeats. \"Listen. Do you think it\u0027s fair to take money from people who do have jobs? Who do work?\" His face crumples and he gasps, his voice raspy, \"What am I gonna do?\" \"Listen,\" I say. \"What\u0027s your name?\" \"Al,\" he says. \"Speak up,\" I tell him. \"Come on.\" \"Al,\" he says, a little louder. \"Get a goddamn job, Al,\" I say earnestly. \"You\u0027ve got a negative attitude. That\u0027s what\u0027s stopping you. You\u0027ve got to get your act together. I\u0027ll help you.\" \"You\u0027re so kind, mister. You\u0027re kind. You\u0027re a kind man,\" he blubbers. \"I can tell.\" \"Shhh,\" I whisper. \"It\u0027s okay.\" I start petting the dog. \"Please,\" he says, grabbing for my wrist. \"I don\u0027t know what to do. I\u0027m so cold.\" \"Do you know how bad you smell?\" I whisper this soothingly, stroking his face. \"The stench, my god...\" \"I can\u0027t...\" He chokes, then swallows. \"I can\u0027t find a shelter.\" \"You reek,\" I tell him. \"You reek of... shit.\" I\u0027m still petting the dog, its eyes wide and wet and grateful. \"Do you know that? Goddamnit, Al - look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot,\" I shout. My rage builds, subsides, and I close my eyes,bringing my hand up to squeeze the bridge of my nose, then I sigh: \"Al... I\u0027m sorry. It\u0027s just that... I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t have anything in common with you.\" The bum\u0027s not listening. He\u0027s crying so hard he\u0027s incapable of a coherent answer. I put the bill slowly back into the pocket of my Luciano Soprani jacket and with the other hand stop petting the dog and reach into the other pocket. The bum stops sobbing abruptly and sits up, looking for the fiver or, I presume, his bottle of Thunderbird. I reach out and touch his face gently once more with compassion and whisper, \"Do you know what a f**king loser you are?\" He starts nodding helplessly and I pull out a long, thin knife with a serrated edge and, being very careful not to kill him, push maybe half an inch of the blade into his right eye, flicking the handle up, instantly popping the retina.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-56.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
