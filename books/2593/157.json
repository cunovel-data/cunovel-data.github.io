{"id":96616,"no":157,"title":"Page 157","content":"The elevator operator, also a new addition, stares at the floor as the two of us rise up into the building. I\u0027m trying to retrace my steps on that night, during that whole week, uselessly knowing I have never been back to this apartment after murdering the two girls. How much is Owen\u0027s apartment worth? is a question that keeps forcing its way into my mind until finally it just rests there, throbbing. The Patty Winter Show this morning was about people with half their brains removed. My chest feels like ice.\\n\\n The elevator doors open. I step out, cautiously, watching behind me as they close, then I\u0027m moving down the hallway toward Owen\u0027s apartment. I can hear voices inside. I lean against the wall, sighing, keys in my hand, knowing already the locks have been changed. As I wonder what I should do, trembling, staring at my loafers, which are black and by A. Testoni, the door to the apartment opens, startling me out of a momentary flash of self-pity. A middle-aged real estate broker walks out, offers a smile, asks, checking her book, \"Are you my eleven o\u0027clock?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I say.\\n\\n She says \"Excuse me\" and, making her way down the hall, looks back at me, once, with a strange expression on her face, before disappearing around the corner. I\u0027m staring into the apartment. A couple in their late twenties stand, conferring with each other, in the middle of the living room. She\u0027s wearing a wool jacket, a silk blouse, wool flannel slacks, Armani, vermeil earrings, gloves, holding a bottle of Evian water. He has on a tweed sport jacket, cashmere sweater vest, cotton chambray shirt, tie, Paul Stuart, Agnes B. cotton trench coat draped over arm. Behind them, the apartment looks spotless. New venetian blinds, the cowhide paneling is gone; however, the furniture, the mural, the glass coffee table, Thonet chairs, black leather couch, all seem intact; the large-screen television set has been moved into the living room and it\u0027s been turned on, the volume low, a commercial where a stain walks off a jacket and addresses the camera is on now, but it doesn\u0027t make me forget what I did to Christie\u0027s br**sts, to one of the girls\u0027 heads, the nose missing, both ears bitten off, how you could see her teeth through where I had ripped the flesh from her jaws and both cheeks, the torrents of gore and the blood that washed over the apartment, the stench of the dead, my own confused warning that I had drawn in -\\n\\n \"Can I help you?\" the real estate agent, Mrs. Wolfe I\u0027m guessing, intrudes. She has a very angular thin face, the nose is large, distressingly real -looking, heavily lipsticked mouth, white-blue eyes. She\u0027s wearing a wool boucle jacket, washed silk blouse, shoes, earrings, a bracelet, from where? I don\u0027t know. Maybe she\u0027s younger than forty.\\n\\n I\u0027m still leaning against the wall, staring at the couple, who move back into the bedroom, leaving the main room empty. I\u0027m just noticing that bouquets in glass vases, dozens of them, fill the apartment everywhere, and I can smell them from where I\u0027m standing in the hall. Mrs. Wolfe glances behind her to see what I\u0027m staring at, then back to me. \"I\u0027m looking for... Doesn\u0027t Paul Owen live here?\"\\n\\n A long pause before she answers. \"No. He doesn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n Another long pause. \"Are you, like... sure?\" I ask, before feebly adding, \"I don\u0027t... understand.\"\\n\\n She realizes something that causes the muscles in her face to tighten. Her eyes narrow but don\u0027t close. She\u0027s noticed the surgical mask I\u0027m gripping in a damp fist and she breathes in, sharply, refusing to look away. I am definitely not feeling right about any of this. On the TV, in a commercial, a man holds up a piece of toast and tells his wife, \"Hey, you\u0027re right... this margarine really does taste better than shit.\" The wife smiles.\\n\\n \"You saw the ad in the Times?\" she asks.\\n\\n \"No... I mean yes. Yes, I did. In the Times,\" I falter, gathering a pocket of strength, the smell from the roses thick, masking something revolting. \"But... doesn\u0027t Paul Owen... still own this?\" I ask, as forcibly as possible.\\n\\n There\u0027s a long pause before she admits, \"There was no ad in the Times.\"\\n\\n We stare at each other endlessly. I\u0027m convinced she senses I\u0027m about to say something. I\u0027ve seen this look on someone\u0027s face before. Was it in a club? A victim\u0027s expression? Had it appeared on a movie screen recently? Or had I seen it in the mirror? It takes what seems like an hour before I can speak again. \"But that\u0027s... his\" - I stop, my heart skips, resumes beating - \"furniture.\" I drop my umbrella, then lean down quickly to retrieve it.\\n\\n \"I think you should go,\" she says.\\n\\n \"I think... I want to know what happened.\" I feel sick, my chest and back covered with sweat, drenched, it seems, instantaneously.\\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-157.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
