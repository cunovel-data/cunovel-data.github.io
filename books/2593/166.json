Then I make my way back to our booth where John Edmonton and Peter Beavers are now sitting and I numb myself with a Halcion before taking Jean home, back to my place. Jean is wearing something by Oscar de la Renta. Nina Goodrich was wearing a sequined dress by Matsuda and refused to give me her number, even though Jean was in the women\u0027s room downstairs.\n Taxi Driver\n Another broken scene in what passes for my life occurs on Wednesday, seemingly pointing to someone\u0027s fault, though whose I can\u0027t be sure. Stuck in gridlock in a cab heading downtown toward Wall Street after a power breakfast at the Regency with Peter Russell, who used to be my dealer before he got a real job, and Eddie Lambert. Russell was wearing a two-button wool sport coat by Redaelli, a cotton shirt by Hackert, a silk tie by Richel, pleated wool trousers by Krizia Uomo and leather Cole-Haan shoes. The Patty Winters Show this morning was about girls in the fourth grade who trade sex for crack and I almost canceled with Lambert and Russell to catch it. Russell ordered for me while I was in the lobby on the phone. It was, unfortunately, a high-fat, high-sodium breakfast and before I could comprehend what was happening, plates of herbed waffles with ham in Madeira cream sauce, grilled sausages and sour cream coffee cake were set at our table and I had to ask the waiter for a pot of decaf herbal tea, a plate of sliced mango with blueberries and a bottle of Evian. In the early morning light that poured through the windows at the Regency I watched as our waiter shaved black truffles gracefully over Lambert\u0027s steaming eggs. Overcome, I broke down and demanded to have the black truffles shaved over my mango slices. Nothing much happened during the breakfast. I had to make another phone call, and when I returned to our table I noticed that a mango slice was missing, but I didn\u0027t accuse anyone. I had other things on my mind: how to help America\u0027s schools, the trust gap, desk sets, a new era of possibilities and what\u0027s in it for me, getting tickets to see Sting in The Threepenny Opera, which just opened on Broadway, how to take more and remember less...\n In the cab I\u0027m wearing a double-breasted cashmere and wool overcoat by Studio 000.1 from Ferre, a wool suit with pleated trousers by DeRigueur from Schoeneman, a silk tie by Givenchy Gentleman, socks by Interwoven, shoes by Armani, reading the Wall Street Journal with my Ray-Ban sunglasses on and listening to a Walkman with a Bix Beiderbecke tape playing in it. I put down the Journal, pick up the Post, just to check Page Six. At the light on Seventh and Thirty-fourth, in the cab next to this one sits, I think, Kevin Gladwin, wearing a suit by Ralph Lauren. I lower my sunglasses. Kevin looks up from the new issue of Money magazine and spots me looking over at him in a curious way before his cab moves forward in the traffic. The cab I\u0027m in suddenly breaks free of the gridlock and turns right on Twenty-seventh, taking the West Side Highway down to Wall Street. I put the paper down, concentrate on the music and the weather, how unseasonably cool it is, and I\u0027m just beginning to notice the way the cabdriver looks at me in the rearview mirror. A suspicious, hungry expression keeps changing the features on his face - a mass of clogged pores, ingrown hairs. I sigh, expecting this, ignoring him. Open the hood of a car and it will tell you something about the people who designed it, is just one of many phrases I\u0027m tortured by.\n But the driver knocks on the plexiglass divider, motions to me. While taking the Walkman off I notice he\u0027s locked all the doors - I see the locks lower in a flash, hear the hollow clicking noise, the moment I turn the volume off. The cab is speeding faster than it should down the highway, in the far right lane. \"Yes?\" I ask irritably. \"What?\"\n \"Hey, don\u0027t I know you?\" he asks in a thick, barely penetrable accent that could easily be either New Jersey or Mediterranean.\n \"No.\" I start putting the Walkman back on.\n \"You look familiar,\" he says. \"What\u0027s your name?\"\n \"No I don\u0027t. You don\u0027t either,\" I say, then, an afterthought, \"Chris Hagen.\"\n \"Come on.\" He\u0027s smiling like there\u0027s something wrong. \"I know who you are.\"\n \"I\u0027m in a movie. I\u0027m an actor,\" I tell him. \"A model.\"\n \"Nah, that\u0027s not it,\" he says grimly.\n \"Well\" - I lean over, checking his name - \"Abdullah, do you have a membership at M.K.?\"\n He doesn\u0027t answer. I reopen the Post to a photo of the mayor dressed as a pineapple, then close it again and rewind the tape in my Walkman. I start counting to myself - one, two, three, four - my eyes focus in on the meter. Why didn\u0027t I carry a gun with me this morning? Because I didn\u0027t think I had to. The only weapon on me is a used knife from last night.\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-166.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: \n Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
