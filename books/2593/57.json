{"id":96516,"no":57,"title":"Page 57","content":"The bum is too surprised to say anything. He only opens his mouth in shock and moves a grubby, mittened hand slowly up to his face. I yank his pants down and in the passing headlights of a taxi can make out his flabby black thighs, rashed because of his constantly urinating in the pantsuit. The stench of shit rises quickly into my face and breathing through my mouth, down on my haunches, I start stabbing him in the stomach, lightly, above the dense matted patch of pubic hair. This sobers him up somewhat and instinctively he tries to cover himself with his hands and the dog starts yipping, really furiously, but it doesn\u0027t attack, and I keep stabbing at the bum now between his fingers, stabbing the backs of his hands. His eye, burst open, hangs out of its socket and runs down his face and he keeps blinking which causes what\u0027s left of it inside the wound to pour out like red, veiny egg yolk. I grab his head with one hand and push it back and then with my thumb and forefinger hold the other eye open and bring the knife up and push the tip of it into the socket, first breaking its protective film so the socket fills with blood, then slitting the eyeball open sideways, and he finally starts screaming once I slit his nose in two, lightly spraying me and the dog with blood, Gizmo blinking to get the blood out of his eyes. I quickly wipe the blade clean across the bum\u0027s face, breaking open the muscle above his cheek. Still kneeling, I throw a quarter in his face, which is slick and shiny with blood, both sockets hollowed out and filled with gore, what\u0027s left of his eyes literally oozing over his screaming lips in thick, webby strands. Calmly, I whisper, \"There\u0027s a quarter. Go buy some gum, you crazy f**king nigger.\" Then I turn to the barking dog and when I get up, stomp on its front legs while it\u0027s crouched down ready to jump at me, its fangs bared, immediately shattering the bones in both its legs, and it falls on its side squealing in pain, front paws sticking up in the air at an obscene, satisfying angle. I can\u0027t help but start laughing and I linger at the scene, amused by this tableau. When I spot an approaching taxi, I slowly walk away.\n Afterwards, two blocks west, I feel heady, ravenous, pumped up, as if I\u0027d just worked out and endorphins are flooding my nervous system, or just embraced that first line of cocaine, inhaled the first puff of a fine cigar, sipped that first glass of Cristal. I\u0027m starving and need something to eat, but I don\u0027t want to stop by Nell\u0027s, though I\u0027m within walling distance and Indochine seems an unlikely place for a celebratory drink. So I decide to go somewhere Al would go, the McDonald\u0027s in Union Square. Standing in the line, I order a vanilla milk shake (\"Extra -thick,\" I warn the guy, who just shakes his head and flips on a machine) and take it to a table up front, where Al would probably sit, my jacket, and its sleeves, lightly spattered with flecks of his blood. Two waitresses from the Cat Club walk in after me and sit in the booth across from mine, both smiling flirtatiously. I play it cool and ignore them. An old, crazy woman, wrinkled, chain-smoking, sits near us, nodding at no one. A police car passes by, and after two more milk shakes my high slowly dissolves, its intensity diminishing. I grow bored, tired; the evening seems horribly anticlimactic and I start cursing myself for not going to that Salvadorian bistro with Reed Thompson and the guys. The two girls linger, still interested. I check my watch. One of the Mexicans working behind the counter stares at me while smoking a cigarette and he studies the stains on the Soprani jacket in a way that suggests he\u0027s going to say something about it, but a customer comes in, one of the black guys who tried to sell me crack earlier, and he has to take the black guy\u0027s order. So the Mexican puts out his cigarette and that\u0027s what he does.\n Genesis\n I\u0027ve been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before that I didn\u0027t really understand any of their work, though on their last album of the 1970s, the concept-laden And Then There Were Three (a reference to band member Peter Gabriel, who left the group to start a lame solo career), I did enjoy the lovely \"Follow You, Follow Me.\" Otherwise all the albums before Duke seemed too artsy, too intelleotual. It was Duke (Atlantic; 1980), where Phil Collins\u0027 presence became more apparent, and the music got more modern, the drum machine became more prevalent and the lyrics started getting less mystical and more specific (maybe because of Peter Gabriel\u0027s departure), and complex, ambiguous studies of loss became, instead, smashing first-rate pop songs that I gratefully embraced. The songs themselves seemed arranged more around Collins\u0027 drumming than Mike Rutherford\u0027s bass lines or Tony Banks\u0027 keyboard riffs. A classic example of this is \"Misunderstanding,\" which not only was the group\u0027s first big hit of the eighties but also seemed to set the tone for the rest of theiralbums as the decade progressed. The other standout on Duke is \"Turn It On Again,\" which is about the negative effects of television. On the other hand, \"Heathaze\" is a song I just don\u0027t understand, while \"Please Don\u0027t Ask\" is a touching love song written to a separated wife who regains custody of the couple\u0027s child. Has the negative aspect of divorce ever been rendered in more intimate terms by a rock \u0027n\u0027 roll group? I don\u0027t think so. \"Duke Travels\" and \"Dukes End\" might mean something but since the lyrics aren\u0027t printed it\u0027s hard to tell what Collins is singing about, though there is complex, gorgeous piano work by Tony Banks on the latter track. The only bummer about Duke is \"Alone Tonight,\" which is way too reminiscent of \"Tonight Tonight Tonight\" from the group\u0027s later masterpiece Invisible Touch and the only example, really, of where Collins has plagiarized himself.\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-57.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: \n Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
