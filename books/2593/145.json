{"id":96604,"no":145,"title":"Page 145","content":"\"I think, Evelyn, that...\" I start, stall, start again. \"...that we\u0027ve lost touch.\"\n \"Why? What\u0027s wrong?\" She\u0027s waving to a couple - Lawrence Montgomery and Geena Webster, I think - and from across the room Geena (?) holds up her hand, which has a bracelet on it. Evelyn nods approvingly.\n \"My... my need to engage in... homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected,\" I tell her, measuring each word carefully. \"But I... have no other way to express my blocked... needs.\" I\u0027m surprised at how emotional this admission makes me, and it wears me down; I feel light-headed. As usual, Evelyn misses the essence of what I\u0027m saying, and I wonder how long it will take to finally rid myself of her.\n \"We need to talk,\" I say quietly.\n She puts her empty water glass down and stares at me. \"Patrick,\" she begins. \"If you\u0027re going to start in again on why I should have breast implants, I\u0027m leaving, \" she warns.\n I consider this, then, \"It\u0027s over, Evelyn. It\u0027s all over.\"\n \"Touchy, touchy,\" she says, motioning to the waiter for more water.\n \"I\u0027m serious,\" I say quietly. \"It is f**king over. Us. This is no joke.\"\n She looks back at me and I think that maybe someone is actually comprehending what I\u0027m trying to get through to them, but then she says, \"Let\u0027s just avoid the issue, all right? I\u0027m sorry I said anything. Now, are we having coffee?\" Again she waves the waiter over.\n \"I\u0027ll have a decaf espresso,\" Evelyn says. \"Patrick?\"\n \"Port,\" I sigh. \"Any kind of port.\"\n \"Would you like to see - \" the waiter begins.\n \"Just the most expensive port,\" I cut him off. \"And oh yeah, a dry beer.\"\n \"My my,\" Evelyn murmurs after the waiter leaven.\n \"Are you still seeing your shrink?\" I ask.\n \"Patrick, \" she warns. \"Who?\"\n \"Sorry,\" I sigh. \"Your doctor.\"\n \"No.\" She opens her handbag, looking for something.\n \"Why not?\" I ask, concerned.\n \"I told you why,\" she says dismissively.\n \"But I don\u0027t remember,\" I say, mimicking her.\n \"At the end of a session he asked me if I could get him plus three into Nell\u0027s that night.\" She checks her mouth, the lips, in the mirror of the compact. \"Why do you ask?\"\n \"Because I think you need to see someone,\" I begin, hesitantly, honestly. \"I think you are emotionally unstable.\"\n \"You have a poster of Oliver North in your apartment and you\u0027re calling me unstable?\" she asks, searching for something else in the handbag.\n \"No. You are, Evelyn.\" I say.\n \"Exaggerating. You\"re exaggerating,\" she says, rifling through the bag, not looking at me.\n I sigh, but then begin gravely, \"I\u0027m not going to push the issue, but - \"\n \"How uncharacteristic of you, Patrick,\" she says.\n \"Evelyn. This has got to end,\" I sigh, talking to my napkin. \"I\u0027m twenty-seven. I don\u0027t want to be weighed down with a commitment.\"\n \"Honey?\" she asks.\n \"Don\u0027t call me that, \" I snap.\n \"What? Honey?\" she asks.\n \"Yes,\" I snap again.\n \"What do you want me to call you?\" she asks, indignantly. \"CEO?\" She stifles a giggle.\n \"Oh Christ.\"\n \"No, really Patrick. What do you want me to call you?\"\n King, I\u0027m thinking. King, Evelyn. I want you to call me King. But I don\u0027t say this. \"Evelyn. I don\u0027t want you to call me anything. I don\u0027t think we should see each other anymore.\"\n \"But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don\u0027t think it would work,\" she says, and then, staring at a spot above my mouth, \"You have a tiny fleck on the top of your lip. Use your napkin.\"\n Exasperated, I brush the fleck away. \"Listen, I, know that your friends are my friends and vice versa. I\u0027ve thought about that.\" After a pause I say, breathing in, \"You can have them.\"\n Finally she looks at me, confused, and murmurs, \"You\u0027re really serious, aren\u0027t you?\"\n \"Yes\", I say, \"I am.\"\n \"But... what about us? What about the past?\" she asks blankly.\n \"The past isn\u0027t real. It\u0027s just a dream,\" I say. \"Don\u0027t mention the past.\"\n She narrows her eyes with suspicion. \"Do you have something against me, Patrick?\" And then the hardness in her face changes instantaneously to expectation, maybe hope. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-145.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: \n Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
