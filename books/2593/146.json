Who do you think is, Patrick? Who do you want?\" After an angry pause she asks, \"Cher?\"\n \"Cher?\" I ask back, confused. \"Cher? What are you talking about? Oh forget it. I want it over. I need sex on a regular basis. I need to be distracted.\"\n In a matter of seconds she becomes frantic, barely able to contain the rising hysteria that\u0027s surging through her body. I\u0027m not enjoying it as much as I thought I would. \"But what about the past? Our past?\" she asks again, uselessly.\n \"Don\u0027t mention it,\" I tell her, leaning in.\n \"Why not?\"\n \"Because we never really shared one,\" I say, keeping my voice from rising.\n She calms herself down and, ignoring me, opening her handbag again, mutters, \"Pathological. Your behavior is pathological.\"\n \"What does that mean?\" I ask, offended.\n \"Abhorrent. You\u0027re pathological.\" She finds a Laura Ashley pillbox and unsnaps it.\n \"Pathological what?\" I ask, trying to smile.\n \"Forget it.\" She takes a pill that I don\u0027t recognize and uses my water to swallow it.\n \"I\u0027m pathological? You\u0027re telling me that I\u0027m pathological?\" I ask.\n \"We look at the world differently, Patrick.\" She sniffs.\n \"Thank god,\" I say viciously.\n \"You\u0027re inhuman,\" she says, trying, I think, not to cry.\n \"I\u0027m\" - I stall, attempting to defend myself - \"in touch with... humanity.\"\n \"No, no, no.\" She shakes her head.\n \"I know my behavior is... erratic sometimes,\" I say, fumbling.\n Suddenly, desperately, she takes my hand from acres the table, pulling it closer to her. \"What do you want me to do? What is it you want?\"\n \"Oh Evelyn,\" I groan, pulling my hand away, shocked that I\u0027ve finally gotten through to her.\n She\u0027s crying. \"What do you want me to do, Patrick? Tell me. Please,\" she begs.\n \"You should... oh god, I don\u0027t know. Wear erotic underwear?\" I say, guessing. \"Oh Jesus, Evelyn. I don\u0027t know. Nothing. You can\u0027t do anything.\"\n \"Please, what can I do?\" she sobs quietly.\n \"Smile less often? Know more about cars? Say my name with less regularity? Is this what you want to hear?\" I ask. \"It won\u0027t change anything. You don\u0027t even drink beer,\" I mutter.\n \"But you don\u0027t drink beer either.\"\n \"\u0027That doesri t matter. Besides, I just ordered one. So there.\"\n \"Oh Patrick.\"\n \"If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making a scene right now,\" I say, looking uncomfortably around the room.\n \"Waiter?\" she asks, as soon as he sets down the decaf espresso, the port and the dry beer. \"I\u0027ll have a... I\u0027ll have a... a what?\" She looks over at me tearfully, confused and panicked. \"A Corona? Is that what you drink, Patrick? A Corona?\"\n \"Oh my god. Give it up. Please, just excuse her,\" I tell the waiter, then, as soon as he walks away, \"Yes. A Corona. But we\u0027re in a f**king Chinese-Cajun bistro so - \"\n \"Oh god, Patrick,\" she sobs, blowing her nose into the handkerchief I\u0027ve tossed at her. \"You\u0027re so lousy. You\u0027re... inhuman.\"\n \"No, I\u0027m...\" I stall again.\n \"You... are not...\" She stops, wiping her face, unable to finish.\n \"I\u0027m not what?\" I ask, waiting, interested.\n \"You are not\" - she sniffs, looks down, her shoulders heaving - \"all there. You\" - she chokes - \"don\u0027t add up.\"\n \"I do too,\" I say indignantly, defending myself. \"I do too add up.\"\n \"You\u0027re a ghoul,\" she sobs.\n \"No, no,\" I say, confused, watching her. \"You\u0027re the ghoul.\"\n \"Oh god,\" she moans, causing the table next to ours to look over, then away. \"I can\u0027t believe this.\"\n \"I\u0027m leaving now,\" I say soothingly. \"I\u0027ve assessed the situation and I\u0027m going.\"\n \"Don\u0027t,\" she says, trying to grab my hand. \"Don\u0027t go.\"\n \"I\u0027m leaving, Evelyn.\"\n \"Where are you going?\" Suddenly she looks remarkably composed. She\u0027s been careful not to let the tears, which actually I\u0027ve just noticed are very few, affect her makeup. \"Tell me, Patrick, where are you going?\"\n I\u0027ve placed a cigar on the table. She\u0027s too upset to even comment. \"I\u0027m just leaving,\" I say simply. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-146.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: \n Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
