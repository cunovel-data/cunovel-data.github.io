{"id":96560,"no":101,"title":"Page 101","content":"\"Listen,\" she says, \"have you gone to any concerts lately?\"\n \"No,\" I say, wishing she hadn\u0027t brought this, of all topics, up. \"I don\u0027t like live music.\"\n \" music?\" she asks, intrigued, sipping San Pellegrino water.\n \"Yeah. You know. Like a band,\" I explain, sensing from her expression that I\u0027m saying totally the wrong things. \"Oh, I forgot. I did see U2.\"\n \"How were they?\" she asks. \"I liked the new CD a lot.\"\n \"They were great, just totally great. Just totally...\" I pause, unsure of what to say. Bethany raises her eyebrows quizzically, wanting to know more. \"Just totally... Irish.\"\n \"I\u0027ve heard they\u0027re quite good live,\" she says, and her own voice has a light, musical lilt to it. \"Who else do you like?\"\n \"Oh you know,\" I say, completely stuck. \"The Kingsmen. \u0027Louie, Louie.\u0027 That sort of stuff.\"\n \"Gosh, Patrick,\" she says, looking at every part of my face.\n \"What?\" I panic, immediately touching my hair. \"Too much mousse? You don\u0027t like the Kingsmen?\"\n \"No.\" She laughs. \"I just don\u0027t remember you being so tan back at school.\"\n \"I had a tan then, didn\u0027t I?\" I ask. \"I mean I wasn\u0027t Casper the Ghost or anything, was I?\" I put my elbow on the table and flex my biceps, asking her to squeeze the muscle. After she touches it, reluctantly, I resume my questions. \"Was I really not that tan at Harvard?\" I ask mock-worriedly, but worriedly.\n \"No, no.\" She laughs. \"You were definitely the George Hamilton of the class of eighty-four.\"\n \"Thanks,\" I say, pleased.\n The waiter brings our drinks - two bottles of San Pellegrino water. Scene Two.\n \"So you\u0027re at Mill... on the water? Taffeta? What is it?\" I ask. Her body, her skin tone, seem firm and rosy.\n \"Milbank Tweed,\" she says. \"That\u0027s where I am.\"\n \"Well,\" I say, squeezing a lime into my glass. \"That\u0027s just wonderful. Law school really paid off.\"\n \"And you\u0027re at... P \u0026 P?\" she asks.\n \"Yes,\" I say.\n She nods, pauses, wants to say something, debates whether she should, then asks, all in a matter of seconds: \"But doesn\u0027t your family own - \"\n \"I don\u0027t want to talk about this,\" I say, cutting her off. \"But yes, Bethany. Yes.\"\n \"And you still work at P \u0026 P?\" she asks. Each syllable is spaced so that it bursts, booming sonically, into my head.\n \"Yes,\" I say, looking furtively around the room.\n \"But - \" She\u0027s confused. \"Didn\u0027t your father - \"\n \"Yes, of course,\" I say, interrupting. \"Have you had the focaccia at Pooncakes?\"\n \"Patrick.\"\n \"Yes?\"\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\n \"I just don\u0027t want to talk about...\" I stop. \"About work.\"\n \"Why not?\"\n \"Because I hate it,\" I say. \"Now listen, have you tried Pooncakes yet? I think Miller underrated it.\"\n \"Patrick,\" she says slowly. \"If you\u0027re so uptight about work, why don\u0027t you just quit? You don\u0027t have to work.\"\n \"Because,\" I say, staring directly at her, \"I... want... to... fit... in.\"\n After a long pause, she smiles. \"I see.\" There\u0027s another pause.\n This one I break. \"Just look at it as, well, a new approach to business,\" I say.\n \"How\" - she stalls - \"sensible.\" She stalls again. \"How, um, practical.\"\n Lunch is alternately a burden, a puzzle that needs to be solved, an obstacle, and then it floats effortlessly into the realm of relief and I\u0027m able to give a skillful performance - my overriding intelligence tunes in and lets me know that it can sense how much she wants me, but I hold back, uncommitted. She\u0027s also holding back, but flirting nonetheless. She has made a promise by asking me to lunch and I panic, once the squid is served, certain that I will never recover unless it\u0027s fulfilled. Other men notice her as they pass by our table. Sometimes I coolly bring my voice down to a whisper. I\u0027m hearing things - noise, mysterious sounds, inside my head; her mouth opens, closes, swallows liquid, smiles, takes me in like a magnet covered with lipstick, mentions something involving fax machines, twice. I finally order a J\u0026B on the rocks, then a cognac. She has mint-coconut sorbet. I touch, hold her hand across the table, more than a friend. Sun pours into Vanities, the restaurant empties out, it nears three. She orders a glass of chardonnay, then another, then the check. She has relaxed but something happens. My heartbeat rises and falls, momentarily stabilizes. I listen carefully. Possibilities once imagined plummet. She lowers her eyes and when she looks back at me I lower mine. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-101.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: \n Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
