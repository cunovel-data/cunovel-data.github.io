Has this passed through anyone\u0027s mind?\" I ask, doubting it.\n \"But Zeus Bar is closed. and besides that we canceled a reservation we didn\u0027t even have there,\" McDermott says, trying to stay calm.\n \"But I think I told Jeanette and Evelyn to meet us there,\" I say, bringing my fingers up to my mouth, horrified by this possibility.\n After a pause McDermott asks, \"Do you want to get into trouble? Are you asking for it or something?\"\n \"My call waiting,\" I say. \"Oh my god. What time is it? My call waiting.\"\n \"It\u0027s gotta be one of the girls,\" Van Patten says gleefully.\n \"Hold on,\" I croak.\n \"Good luck,\" I hear Van Patten say before I click off.\n \"Hello?\" I ask meekly. \"You have reached the - \"\n \"It\u0027s me,\" Evelyn shouts, the noise in the background almost drowning her out.\n \"Oh hi,\" I say casually. \"What\u0027s going on?\"\n \"Patrick, what are you doing.at home?\"\n \"Where are you?\" I ask good-naturedly.\n \"I-am-at-Kaktus,\" she hisses.\n \"What are you doing there?\" I ask.\n \"You said you\u0027d meet me here, that-is-what,\" she says. \"I confirmed your reservations.\"\n \"Oh god, I\u0027m sorry,\" I say. \"I forgot to tell you.\"\n \"Forgot-to-tell-me-what?\"\n \"To tell you that we aren\u0027t\" - I gulp - \"going there.\" I close my eyes.\n \"Who-in-the-hell-is-Jeanette?\" she hisses calmly.\n \"Well, aren\u0027t you guys having fun?\" I ask, ignoring her question.\n \"No-we-are-not.\"\n \"Why not?\" I ask. \"We\u0027ll be there... soon.\"\n \"Because this whole thing feels, gee, I don\u0027t know... inappropriate?\" she screams.\n \"Listen, I\u0027ll call you right back.\" I\u0027m about to pretend to take the number down.\n \"You won\u0027t be able to,\" Evelyn says, her voice tense and lowered.\n \"Why not? The phone strike\u0027s over,\" I joke, sort of.\n \"Because-Jeanette-is-behind-me-and-wants-to-use-it,\" Evelyn says.\n I pause for a very long time.\n \"Pat-rick?\"\n \"Evelyn. Let it slide. I\u0027m leaving right now. We\u0027ll all be there shortly. I promise.\"\n \"Oh my god - \"\n I click back to the other line.\n \"Guys, guys, someone f**ked up. I f**ked up. You f**ked up. I don\u0027t know,\" I say in a total panic.\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" one of them asks.\n \"Jeanette and Evelyn are at Kaktus,\" I say.\n \"Oh boy.\" Van Patter cracks up.\n \"You know, guys, it\u0027s not beyond my capacity to drive a lead pipe repeatedly into a girl\u0027s vagina,\" I tell Van Patter and McDermott, then add, after a silence I mistake for shock, finally on their parts an acute perception of my cruelty, \"but compassionately.\"\n \"We all know about your lead pipe, Bateman,\" McDermott says. \"Stop bragging.\"\n \"Is he like trying to tell us he has a big dick?\" Van Patter asks Craig.\n \"Gee, I\u0027m not sure,\" McDermott says. \"Is that what you\u0027re trying to tell us, Bateman?\"\n I pause before answering. \"It\u0027s... well, no, not exactly.\" My call waiting buzzes.\n \"Fine, I\u0027m officially jealous,\" McDermott wisecracks. \"Now where? Christ, what time is it?\"\n \"It doesn\u0027t really matter. My mind has already gone numb.\"\n I\u0027m so hungry now that I\u0027m eating oat bran cereal out of a box.\n My call waiting buzzes again.\n \"Maybe we can get some drugs.\"\n \"Call Hamlin.\"\n \"Jesus, you can\u0027t walk into a bathroom in this city without coming out with a gram, so don\u0027t worry.\"\n \"Anyone hear about Bell South\u0027s cellular deal?\"\n \"Spuds McKenzie is on The Patty Winters Show tomorrow.\n Chapter Nineteen\n Girl\n On a Wednesday night another girl, who I meet at M.K. and I plan to torture and film. This one remains nameless to me and she sits on the couch in the living room of my apartment. A bottle of champagne, Cristal, half empty, sits on the glass table. I punch in tunes, numbers that light up the Wurlitzer. She finally asks, \"What\u0027s that... smell in here?\" and I answer, under my breath, \"A dead... rat,\" and then I\u0027m opening the windows, the sliding glass door that leads out to the terrace, even though it\u0027s a chilly night, mid-autumn, and she\u0027s dressed scantily, but she has another glass of the Cristal and it seems to warm her enough so that she is able to ask me what I do for a living. I tell her that I went to Harvard then started working on Wall Street, at Pierce \u0026 Pierce, after I graduated from business school there, and when she asks, either confused or jokingly, \"What\u0027s that?\" I swallow and with my back to her, straightening the new Onica, find the strength to force out, \"A... shoe store.\" I did a line of cocaine I found in my medicine cabinet when we first came back to my place, and the Cristal takes the edge off it, but only slightly: The Patty Winters Show this morning was about a machine that lets people talk to the dead. This girl is wearing a wool barathea jacket and skirt, a silk georgette blouse, agate and ivory earrings by Stephen Dweck, a silk jacquard torsolette vest, all from... where? Charivari, I\u0027m guessing. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-139.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: \n Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
