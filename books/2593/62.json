{"id":96521,"no":62,"title":"Page 62","content":"The concert has been dragging on now for maybe twenty minutes. I hate live music but everyone around us is standing, their screams of approval competing with the racket coming from the towering walls of speakers stacked over us. The only real pleasure I get from being here is seeing Scott and Anne Smiley ten rows behind us, in shittier though probably not less expensive seats. Carruthers changes seats with Evelyn to discuss business with me, but I can\u0027t hear a word so I change seats with Evelyn to talk to Courtney.\\n\\n \"Luis is a weasel,\" I shout. \"He suspects nothing.\"\\n\\n \"The Edge is wearing Armani,\" she shouts, pointing at the bassist.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not Armani,\" I shout back. \"It\u0027s Empor io.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" she shouts. \"Armani.\"\\n\\n \"The grays are too muted and so are the taupes and navies. Definite winged lapels, subtle plaids, polka dots and stripes are Armani. Not Emporio, \" I shout, extremely irritated that she doesn\u0027t know this, can\u0027t differentiate, both my hands covering both ears. \"There\u0027s a difference. Which one\u0027s The Ledge?\"\\n\\n \"The drummer might be The Ledge,\" she shouts. \"I think. I\u0027m not sure. I need a cigarette. Where were you the other night? If you tell me with Evelyn I\u0027m going to hit you.\"\\n\\n \"The drummer is not wearing anything by Armani,\" I scream. \"Or Emporio for that matter. Nowhere.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know which one the drummer is,\" she shouts.\\n\\n \"Ask Ashley,\" I suggest, screaming.\\n\\n \"Ashley?\" she screams, reaching over across Paul and tapping Ashley\u0027s leg. \"Which one\u0027s The Ledge?\" Ashley shouts something at her that I can\u0027t hear and then Courtney turns back to me, shrugging. \"She said she can\u0027t believe she\u0027s in New Jersey.\"\\n\\n Carruthers motions for Courtney to change seats with him. She waves the little twit away and grips my thigh, which I flex rock-hard, and her hand lingers admiringly. But Luis persists and she gets up, and screams at me, \"I think we need drugs tonight!\" I nod. The lead singer, Bono, is screeching out what sounds like \"Where the Beat Sounds the Same.\" Evelyn and Ashley leave to buy cigarettes, use the ladies\u0027 room, find refreshments. Luis sits next to me.\\n\\n \"The girls are bored,\" Luis screams at me.\\n\\n \"Courtney wants us to find her some cocaine tonight,\" I shout.\\n\\n \"Oh, great.\" Luis looks sulky.\\n\\n \"Do we have reservations anywhere?\"\\n\\n \"Brussels,\" he shouts, checking his Rolex. \"But it\u0027s doubtful if we\u0027ll make it.\"\\n\\n \"If we don\u0027t make it,\" I warn him, \"I\u0027m not going any where else. You can drop me at my apartment.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll make it,\" he shouts.\\n\\n \"If we don\u0027t, what about Japanese?\" I suggest, relenting. \u0027There\u0027s a really top sushi bar on the Upper West Side. Blades. Chef used to be at Loito. It got a great rating in Zagat.\"\\n\\n \"Bateman, I hate the Japanese,\" Carruthers screams at me, one hand placed over an ear. \"Little slanty-eyed bastards.\"\\n\\n \"What,\" I scream, \"in the hell are you talking about?\"\\n\\n \"Oh I know, I know,\" he screams, eyes bulging. \"They save more than we do and they don\u0027t innovate much, but they sure in the f**k know how to take, steal, our innovations, improve on them, then ram them down our f**king throats!\"\\n\\n I stare at him, disbelieving for a moment, then look at the stage, at the guitarist running around in circles, Bono\u0027s arms outstretched as he runs back and forth across the length of its edge, and then back at Luis whose face is still crimson with fury and he\u0027s still staring at me, wide-eyed, spittle on his lips, not saying anything.\\n\\n \"What in the hell does that have to do with Blades?\" I ask finally, genuinely confused. \"Wipe your mouth.\"\\n\\n \u0027\"That\u0027s why I hate Japanese food,\" he screams back. \"Sashimi. California roll. Oh Jesus.\" He makes a gagging motion, with one finger going down his throat.\\n\\n \"Carruthers...\" I stop, still looking at him, studying his face closely, slightly freaked out, unable to remember what I wanted to say.\\n\\n \"What, Bateman?\" Carruthers asks, leaning in.\\n\\n \"Listen, I can\u0027t believe this shit,\" I scream. \"I can\u0027t believe you didn\u0027t make the reservations for later. We\u0027re going to have to wait.\"\\n\\n \"What?\" he screams, cupping his ear, as if it makes a difference.\\n\\n \"We are going to have to wait!\" I scream louder.\\n\\n \"This is not a problem,\" he shouts.\\n\\n The lead singer reaches out to us from the stage, his hand outstretched, and I wave him away. \"It\u0027s okay? It\u0027s okay? No, Luis. You\u0027re wrong. It\u0027s not okay.\" I look over at Paul Owen, who seems equally bored, his hands clamped over both ears, but still managing to confer with Courtney about something. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-62.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
