{"id":96542,"no":83,"title":"Page 83","content":"\"Thirty bucks at the door apiece is not exactly slumming, Evelyn.\" Then I ask, suspiciously, \"Why wasn\u0027t Donald Trump invited to your party?\"\n \"Not Donald Trump again, \" Evelyn moans. \"Oh god. Is that why you were acting like such a buffoon? This obsession has got to end!\" she practically shouts. \"That\u0027s why you were acting like such an ass!\"\n \"It was the Waldorf salad, Evelyn,\" I say, teeth clenched. \"It was the Waldorf salad that was making me act like an ass!\"\n \"Oh my god. You mean it, too!\" She throws her head back in despair. \"I knew it, I knew it.\"\n \"But you didn\u0027t even make it!\" I scream. \"It was catered!\"\n \"Oh god,\" she wails. \"I can\u0027t believe it.\"\n The limousine pulls up in front of Club Chernoble, where a crowd ten deep waits standing outside the ropes in the snow. Evelyn and I get out, and using Evelyn, much to her chagrin, as a blocker, I push my way through the crowd and luckily spot someone who looks exactly like Jonathan Leatherdale, about to be let in, and really shoving Evelyn, who\u0027s still holding on to her Christmas present, I call out to him, \"Jonathan, hey Leatherdale,\" and suddenly, predictably, the whole crowd starts shouting, \"Jonathan, hey Jonathan.\" He spots me as he turns around and calls out, \"Hey Baxter!\" and winks, giving me the thumbs-up sign, but it\u0027s not to me, it\u0027s to someone else. Evelyn and I pretend we\u0027re with his party anyway. The doorman closes the ropes on us, asks, \"You two come in that limo?\" He looks over at the curb and motions with his head.\n \"Yes.\" Evelyn and I both nod eagerly.\n \"You\u0027re in,\" he says, lifting the ropes.\n We walk in and I lay out sixty dollars; not a single drink ticket. The club is predictably dark except for the flashing strobe lights, and even with them, all I can really see is dry ice pumping out of a fog machine and one hardbody dancing to INXS\u0027s \"New Sensation,\" which blasts out of speakers at a pitch that vibrates the body. I tell Evelyn to go to the bar and get us two glasses of champagne. \"Oh of course,\" she shouts back, heading tentatively toward one thin white strip of neon, the only light illuminating what might be a place where alcohol is served. In the meantime I score a gram from someone who looks like Mike Donaldson, and after debating for ten minutes while checking out this hardbody whether I should ditch Evelyn or not, she comes up with two flutes half full of champagne, indignant, sad-faced. \"It\u0027s Korbel,\" she shouts. \"Let\u0027s leave.\" I shake my head negative and shout back, \"Let\u0027s go to the rest rooms.\" She follows.\n The one bathroom at Chernoble is unisex. Two other couples are already there, one of them in the only stall. The other couple is, like us, impatiently waiting for the stall to empty. The girl is wearing a silk jersey halter top, a silk chiffon skirt and silk sling-backs, all by Ralph Lauren. Her boyfriend is wearing a suit tailored by, I think, William Fioravanti or Vincent Nicolosi or Scali - some wop. Both are holding champagne glasses: his, full; hers, empty. It\u0027s quiet except for the sniffling and muted laughter coming from the stall, and the bathroom\u0027s door is thick enough to block out the music except for the deep thumping drumbeat. The guy taps his foot expectantly. The girl keeps sighing and tossing her hair over her shoulder in these strangely enticing jerky head movements; then she looks over at Evelyn and me and whispers something to her boyfriend. Finally, after she whispers something to him again, he nods and they leave.\n \"Thank god,\" I whisper, fingering the gram in my pocket; then, to Evelyn, \"Why are you so quiet?\"\n \"The Waldorf salad,\" she murmurs, not looking at me. \"Damnit.\"\n There\u0027s a click, the door to the stall opens and a young couple - the guy wearing a double-breasted wool cavalry twill suit, cotton shirt and silk tie, all by Givenchy, the girl wearing a silk taffeta dress with ostrich hem by Geoffrey Beene, vermeil earrings by Stephen Dweck Moderne and Chanel grosgrain dance shoes - walks out, discreetly wiping each other\u0027s noses, staring at themselves in the mirror before leaving the rest room, and just as Evelyn and I are about to walk into the stall they\u0027ve vacated, the first couple rushes back in and attempts to overtake it.\n \"Excuse me,\" I say, my arm outstretched, blocking the entrance. \"You left. It\u0027s, uh, our turn, you know?\"\n \"Uh, no, I don\u0027t think so,\" the guy says mildly.\n \"Patrick,\" Evelyn whispers behind me. \"Let them... you know.\"\n \"Wait. No. It\u0027s our turn,\" I say.\n \"Yeah, but we were waiting first.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-83.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: \n Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
