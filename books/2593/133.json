I\u0027ll ask him.\"\\n\\n \"Who?\" A flash of panic. \"Luis?\"\\n\\n \"Hamlin.\"\\n\\n While holding I move into the kitchen, over to the refrigerator, and take out a bottle of Perrier. I\u0027m looking for a glass when I hear a click.\\n\\n \"Listen,\" I say when McDermott gets back on the line. \"I don\u0027t want to see Luis or Courtney so, you know, dissuade them or something. Use your charm. Be charming.\"\\n\\n \"Hamlin has to have dinner with a client from Texas and - \"\\n\\n I cut him off. \"Wait, this has nothing to do with Luis. Let Hamlin take the fag out himself.\"\\n\\n \"Hamlin wants Carruthers to come because Hamlin is supposed to be dealing with the Panasonic case, but Carruthers knows a lot more about it and that\u0027s why he wants Carruthers to come,\" McDermott explains.\\n\\n I pause while taking this in. \"If Luis comes I\u0027ll kill him. I swear to god I\u0027ll kill him. I\u0027ll f**king kill him.\"\\n\\n \"Jeez, Bateman,\" McDermott murmurs, concerned. \"You\u0027re a real humanitarian. A sage.\"\\n\\n \"No. just...\" I start, confused, irritated. \"Just... sensible.\"\\n\\n \"I just want to know if Luis comes does this mean that Courtney will come too?\" he wonders again.\\n\\n \"Tell Hamlin to invite - oh shit, I don\u0027t know.\" I stop. \"Tell Hamlin to have dinner with the Texas guy alone.\" I stop again, realizing something. \"Wait a minute. Does this mean Hamlin will... take us out? I mean pay for it, since it\u0027s a business dinner?\"\\n\\n \"You know, sometimes I think you\u0027re very smart, Bateman,\" McDermott says. \"Other times...\"\\n\\n \"Oh shit, what the hell am I saying?\" I ask myself out loud, annoyed. \"You and I can have a goddamn business dinner together. Jesus. I\u0027m not going. That\u0027s it. I\u0027m not going.\"\\n\\n \"Not even if Luis doesn\u0027t come?\" he asks.\\n\\n \"No. Nope.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\" he whines. \"We have reservations at 1500.\"\\n\\n \"I... have to... watch The Cosby Show.\"\\n\\n \"Oh tape it for Christ sakes, you ass. \"\\n\\n \"Wait.\" I\u0027ve realized something else. \"Do you think Hamlin will\" - I pause awkwardly - \"have some drugs, perhaps... for the Texan?\"\\n\\n \"What does Bateman think?\" McDermott asks, the jaded ass**le.\\n\\n \"Hmmm. I\u0027m thinking about it. I\u0027m thinking about this.\"\\n\\n After a pause McDermott says \"Tick-tock, tick-tock\" in singsong. \"We\u0027re getting nowhere. Of course Hamlin is going to be carrying.\"\\n\\n \"Get Hamlin, have him... get him on three-way,\" I sputter, checking my Rolex. \"Hurry. Maybe we can talk him into 1500.\"\\n\\n \"Okay,\" McDermott says. \"Hold on.\"\\n\\n There are four clicking noises and then I hear Hamlin saying, \"Bateman, is it okay to wear argyle socks with a business suit?\" He\u0027s attempting a joke but it fails to amuse me.\\n\\n Sighing inwardly, my eyes closed, I answer, impatient, \"Not really, Hamlin. They\u0027re too sporty. They interfere with a business image. You can wear them with casual suits. Tweeds, whatever. Now Hamlin?\"\\n\\n \"Bateman?\" And then he says, \u0027\"Thank you.\"\\n\\n \"Luis cannot come,\" I tell him. \"And you\u0027re welcome.\"\\n\\n \"No prob,\" he says. \"The Texan\u0027s not coming anyway.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"Hay letsyall go to See Bee Jee Bees I har that\u0027s pretty new wave. Lifestyle difference,\" Hamlin explains. \"The Texan is not accepted until Monday. I quickly, and quite nimbly I might add, rearranged my hectic schedule. A sick father. A forest fire. An excuse.\"\\n\\n \"How does that take care of Luis?\" I ask suspiciously.\\n\\n \"Luis is having dinner with the Texan tonight, which saves me a whole lotta trouble, pardner. I\u0027m seeing him at Smith and Wollensky on Monday,\" Hamlin says, pleased with himself. \"So everything is A-okay.\"\\n\\n \"Wait,\" McDermott asks tentatively, \"does this mean that Courtney isn\u0027t coming?\"\\n\\n \"We have missed or are going to miss our reservations at 1500,\" I point out. \"Besides, Hamlin, you went there last night, huh?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-133.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
