So\" - I press what I hope is fifty into a small-boned hand - \"if you could make sure we aren\u0027t bothered while we do, we would grate fully appreciate it.\" I rub the hand, closing it into a fist over the bill. \"And if anyone complains, well...\" I pause, then warn menacingly, \"Kick \u0027em out.\"\\n\\n She nods mutely and backs away with this dazed, confused look on her face.\\n\\n \"And,\" Price adds, smiling, \"if another round of Bellinis comes within a twenty-foot radius of this table we are going to set the maitre d\u0027 on fire. So, you know, warn him.\"\\n\\n After a long silence during which we contemplate our appetizers, Van Patten speaks up. \"Bateman?\"\\n\\n \"Yes?\" I fork a piece of monkfish, push it into some of the golden caviar, then place the fork back down.\\n\\n \"You are pure prep perfection,\" he purrs.\\n\\n Price spots another waitress approaching with a tray of four champagne flutes filled with pale pinkish liquid and says, \"Oh for Christ sakes, this is getting ridi culous...\" She sets them down, however, at the table next to us, for the four babes.\\n\\n \"She is hot, \" Van Patten says, ignoring his scallop sausage.\\n\\n \"Hardbody.\" McDermott nods in agreement. \"Definitely.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not impressed,\" Price sniffs. \"Look at her knees.\"\\n\\n While the hardbody stands there we check her out, and though her knees do support long, tan legs, I can\u0027t help noticing that one knee is, admittedly, bigger than the other one. The left knee is knobbier, almost imperceptibly thicker than the right knee and this unnoticeable flaw now seems overwhelming and we all lose interest. Van Patten is looking at his appetizer, stunned, and then he looks at McDermott and says, \"That isn\u0027t what you ordered either. That\u0027s sushi, not sashimi.\"\\n\\n \"Jesus,\" McDermott sighs. \"You don\u0027t come here for the food anyway.\"\\n\\n Some guy who looks exactly like Christopher Lauder comes over to the table and says, patting me on the shoulder, \"Hey Hamilton, nice tan,\" before walking into the men\u0027s room.\\n\\n \"Nice tan, Hamilton,\" Price mimics, tossing tapas onto my bread plate.\\n\\n \"Oh gosh,\" I say, \"hope I\u0027m not blushin\u0027.\"\\n\\n \"Actually, where do you go, Bateman?\" Van Patten asks. \"For a tan.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, Bateman. Where do you go?\" McDermott seems genuinely intrigued.\\n\\n \"Read my lips,\" I say, \"a tanning salon,\" then irritably, \"like everyone else.\"\\n\\n \"I have,\" Van Patten says, pausing for maximum impact, \"a tanning bed at... home,\" and then he takes a large bite out of his scallop sausage.\\n\\n \"Oh bullshit,\" I say, cringing.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s true,\" McDermott confirms, his mouth full. \"I\u0027ve seen it.\"\\n\\n \"That is f**k ing outrageous,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Why the hell is it f**k ing outrageous?\" Price asks, pushing tapas around his plate with a fork.\\n\\n \"Do you know how expensive a f**king tanning salon membership is?\" Van Patten asks me. \"A member ship for a year?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re crazy,\" I mutter.\\n\\n \"Look, guys,\" Van Patten says. \"Bateman\u0027s indignant.\"\\n\\n Suddenly a busboy appears at our table and without asking if we\u0027re finished removes our mostly uneaten appetizers. None of us complain except for McDermott, who asks, \"Did he just take our appetizers away?\" and then laughs uncomprehendingly. But when he sees no one else laughing he stops.\\n\\n \"He took them away because the portions are so small he probably thought we were finished,\" Price says tiredly.\\n\\n \"I just think that\u0027s crazy about the tanning bed,\" I tell Van Patten, though secretly I think it would be a hip luxury except I really have no room for one in my apartment. There are things one could do with it besides getting a tan.\\n\\n \"Who is Paul Owen with?\" I hear McDermott asking Price.\\n\\n \"Some weasel from Kicker Peabody,\" Price says distractedly. \"He knew McCoy.\"\\n\\n \"Then why is he sitting with those dweebs from Drexel?\" McDermott asks. \"Isn\u0027t that Spencer Wynn?\"\\n\\n \"Are you freebasing or what?\" Price asks. \"\u0027That\u0027s not Spencer Wynn.\"\\n\\n I look over at Paul Owen, sitting in a booth with three other guys - one of whom could be Jeff Duvall, suspenders, slicked-back hair, horn-rimmed glasses, all of them drinking champagne - and I lazily wonder about how Owen got the Fisher account. It makes me not hungry but our meals arrive almost immediately after our appetizers are taken away and we begin to eat. McDermott undoes his suspenders. Price calls him a slob. I feel paralyzed but manage to turn away from Owen and stare at my plate (the potpie a yellow hexagon, strips of smoked salmon circling it, squiggles of pea-green tomatillo sauce artfully surrounding the dish) and then I gaze at the waiting crowd. They seem hostile, drunk on complimentary Bellinis perhaps, tired of waiting hours for shitty tables near the open kitchen even though they had reservations. Van Patten interrupts the silence at our table by slamming his fork down and pushing his chair back. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-20.html","bookId":2593,"book":{"id":2593,"title":"American Psycho","description":"Storyline: Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated, intelligent.
