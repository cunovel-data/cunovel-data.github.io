He couldn\u0027t remember anyone ever touching Clint. The sensation of a s hand [email protected] to Clint\u0027s was like a buzz saw raked up his spine.\n \"I men you could go on television with a trick as good as that!\"\n Eisley continued to pump Clint\u0027s arm, oblivious to the danger that coded before him.\n Flint gasped for breath and staggered [email protected] contact between Eisley and his brother. Clint\u0027s arm bobbing up and down, the htfle hand so cupped \"You ... you Words could not convey Flint\u0027s indignation. Mama had seen this new development and had skittered away from Flint\u0027s legs, bouncing up onto the bed where she mpid-fired barks at the bobbing appendage.\n \"You ... don\u0027t touch me!\" Flint said. \"Don\u0027t you ever dare touch me again!\" Eisley was still grinning. This.man, Flint realized, had the power to drive him stark mving insane.\n \"Get packed,\" he said, his voice choked. \"We\u0027re leaven\u0027 in five minutes. And that mutt\u0027s stayin\u0027 here.\"\n \"Oh ... Mr. Murtaugh, sir.\" At last Eisley\u0027s face showed genuine concern. \"Mama and me go everywhere together.\"\n \"Not in my car.\" He shoved Clint\u0027s arm back down inside his shirt, but Clint came out again and kept warching around as if he wanted to continue the hand shaking. \"I\u0027m not carryin\u0027 a damn mutt in my car!\"\n \"Well, I can\u0027t go, then.\" Pelvis sat down on the bed, his expression petulant, and at once Mama was in his lap, licking his double chins. \"I don\u0027t go nowhere without Mama.\"\n \"Okay, good! Forget it! I\u0027m leaven\u0027!\"\n Flint had his hand on the doorknob when Pelvis asked, in all innocence, \"You want me to call Mr. Smoates and tell him it didn\u0027t work out?\"\n Flint stopped. He squeezed his eyes shut for a few seconds. The rage had leapt up again from where it lived and festered, and it was beating like a dark fist behind the door of his face.\n \"I\u0027ll call him,\" Pelvis said. \"Ain\u0027t no use you wastin\u0027 the quarter.\"\n Leave the hillbilly jerk, Flint thought To hell with Smoates, too. I don\u0027t need him or his lousy job. I don\u0027t need anybody.\n But his anger began to recede like a bayou tide, and beneath it was the twisted, busted-up truth: he could not go back to the sideshow, and without Smoates, what would he do?\n Flint turned toward Pelvis. Mama sat in Pelvis\u0027s lap, warily watching Flint. \"Do you even know what this job is about?\" Flint asked. \"Do you have any idea?\"\n \"You mean bounty huntin? Yes sir. It\u0027s @ on TV, where-\" \"Wrong!\"\n Flint had come close to shoufln it, and Mama stiffened her back and began a low [email protected] Pelvis stroked her a couple of times and she quieted down again. -It\u0027s not like on TV.

He owns five or six loan companies in Louisiana and Arkansas and ninety percent of the work he\u0027ll expect you to do is collectin\u0027 money. And that\u0027s not pretty work either, I promise you, \u0027cause you have to shut your eyes to people\u0027s misfortunes and either scare the cash out of them or get rough, if it comes to that. The bounty-huntin\u0027thing is just kind of a sideline. You can some good money out of it if the reward\u0027s high enough, but it\u0027s no game. Every time you go out after a skin, you\u0027re riskin\u0027your life.\n I\u0027ve been shot at, swung on with knives and billy clubs, I\u0027ve had a Doberman set on me, and one @ even tried to take my head off with a samurai sword. You don\u0027t get a lot of second chances in this business, Eisley.\n And I don\u0027t care how many mail-order detective courses you took, if you\u0027re not cold-blooded enough, you\u0027ll never survive your first skin hunt.\" Flint watched the other man\u0027s eyes to see if his message was getting through, but all he saw was dumb admiration. \"You know anydiin\u0027 about the skin we\u0027re supposed to collect?\"\n \"No sir.\"\n \"His name\u0027s Lambert. He\u0027s a Vietnam veteran. Killed a man at a bank this afternoon. He\u0027s probably half crazy and armed to the teeth.\n I wouldn\u0027t care to meet him if there wasn\u0027t a chance of some big money in it. And if I were you, I\u0027d just go call Smoates and tell him you\u0027ve thought this thing over and you\u0027ve decided to pass.\"\n Pelvis nodded. From the glint in Pelvs eye, Flint could tell that a spark had fired in the man\u0027s brain like a bolt of lightning over Lonely Street.\n \"Is that what you\u0027re gonna do, then?\"\n \"Well, I just figured it out,\" PL-Ivis said. \"That ain\u0027t no trick, is it? You really do have three arms, don\u0027t YOU?\"\n The better to strangle you with, Flint thought. \"That\u0027s right-I, \"I never saw such a thing before! I swear, I thought it was a trick at first, but then I got to lookin\u0027 at it and I could tell it was real! What does your wife have to say about it?\"\n \"I\u0027ve never been married.\" Why did I tell him that? Flint asked himself. There was no reason for me to tell him about myself! \"Listen to me, Eisley. You don\u0027t want to go with me after this skin. Believe me, you don\u0027t.\"\n \"Yes sir, I do,\" Pelvis answered firmly. \"I want to learn everythin\u0027 I can. Mr. Smoates said you was the best bounty hunter there is, and I was to listen to you like you was God hisself. You say jump, I\u0027ll ask how high. And don\u0027t you worry about Mama, she don\u0027t have accidents in the car.\n When she wants to pee or dookie, she lets out a howl.\" He shook his head, awestruck. \"Three arms. Now I\u0027ve seen it all. Ain\u0027t we, Mama? Ain\u0027t we seen it all now?\"\n Flint drew a long breath and let it out. Time was wasting.\n \"Get up,\" he said, and those were two of the hardest words he\u0027d ever uttered. \"Pack enough for two nights.\"\n \"Yes sir, yes sir\" Pelvis fairly jumped up from the bed.\n He started throwing clothes into a brown suitcase covered with Graceland, Memphis, and Las Veps stickers. Mama had sensed Pelvis\u0027s excitement, and she began running in circles around the room. For the first time, Flint saw that Pelvis was wearing a pair of honest-to-god blue suede shoes that were run down at the heels.\n \"I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m doin\u0027 this,\" he muttered. \"I must be out of my mind.\"\n \"Don\u0027t you worry, I\u0027ll do whatever you say,\" Pelvis promised.\n Underwear, socks, and gaudy shirts were flying into the suitcase.\n \"I\u0027ll be so quiet, you\u0027ll hardly know I\u0027m there!\"\n \"I\u0027ll bet.\"\n \"Whatever you say, that\u0027s my command. Uh ... you mind if I load up some groceries? I get kinda hungry when I travel.\"\n \"Just do it in a hurry.\"\n Pelvis stuffed another grocery sack with @ dough nuts, peanut butter crackers, Oreos, and dog biscuits. He smiled broadly, his idol sneering at Flint over his shoulder.\n \"We\u0027re ready!\"\n \"One very, very important rule.\" Flint stepped toward Pelvis and stared at him face-to-face. \"You\u0027re not to touch me. Understand? And if that dog touches me, I\u0027m throwin\u0027 it out the window. Hear!?\"\n \"Yes sir, loud and clear.\" Pelvis\u0027s breath made Flint Big 0\"\n Frog wince; it smelled of buttermilk.\n Flint turned away, pushed Clint\u0027s arm under his shirt, and stalked out of the wretched room. Pelvis hafted the suitcase and the groceries, and with a stubby, wagging to, Mama followed her king.\n Dan pushed a quarter into the pay phone\u0027s slot outside an Amoco gas station on Highway 28, less than seven miles west of Alexandria.\n It was twenty minutes after eleven, and the gas station was closed. He pressed the 0 and told the operator his name was Daniel Lewis and he wanted to make a collect call to Susan Lambert at 1219 Jackson Avenue in Alexandria.\n He waited while the number clicked through. Pain thrummed in his skull, and when he licked his rips his tonpe scraped,like sandpaper.\n One ring. Two. Three. Four.\n TheYre not home, he thought. They\u0027re gone, because Susan knew Id want to seeFive rings. Six.\n \"Hello?\" Her voice was as tight as barbed wire.\n \"I have a collect call for Susan Lambert from Daniel @s,\" the operator said. \"Will you accept the charges?\"\n Silence.\n \"Ma\u0027am?\" the operator urged.\n The silence stretched. Dan heard his heartbeat pounding.\n Then: \"Yes, I\u0027ll accept the charges.\"\n \"[email protected] you,\" Dan said when the operator had hung up.\n \"The police are here. They\u0027re waitin\u0027 to see if you\u0027ll show.\"\n \"I knew they would be. Are they listenin\u0027 in?\"\n \"Not from in here. They asked me if I thought you\u0027d can and I said no, we hadn\u0027t talked for years. It has been years, you know.\"\n \"I know.\" He paused, listening for clicks on the line. He heard none, and he\u0027d have to take the risk that the police had not gone through the process of tapping the wires.\n \"How\u0027s Chad?\"\n \"How would you think he is, to find out his father\u0027s shot a man dead?\"\n That one hurt. Dan said, \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027ve heard, but would you like to hear my side of it?\"\n Again she was silent. Susan had always had a way of making silence feel like a chunk of granite pressed down on your skull. At least she hadn\u0027t hung up yet. \"The bank fired Mr. Jarrett, their loan manager,\" he began. \"They hired a new man, and he was gonna repossess my truck. He said some bad things to me, Susan. I know that\u0027s no excuse, but-I\u0027 \"You\u0027re right about that,\" she interrupted.\n \"I just went crazy for a minute. I started tearin\u0027 his office up.\n AB I could think of was that without my truck I was one more step down the hole. A guard came in and he pulled a gun on me. I got it away from him, and then all of a sudden Blanchard had a pistol too and I knew he was gonna shoot me. I swear I didn\u0027t mean to kill him.\n Everythin\u0027 was happenin\u0027 so fast, it was like falhn\u0027 off a train. No matter what the TV or radio says, I didn\u0027t go to that bank lookin\u0027to kill somebody. Do you believe me?\"\n No answer.\n \"We\u0027ve had our troubles,\" Dan said. His knuckles were aching, he was gripping the receiver so tightly. \"I know ...\n you got afraid of me, and I can\u0027t blame you. I should\u0027ve gotten help a long time ago, but I was afraid to. I didn\u0027t know what was wrong with me, I thought I was losin\u0027 my mind. I had a lot to work through. Maybe you won\u0027t believe me, but. I never Red to you, did I?\"\n \"No,\" she replied. \"You never lied to me.\"\n .411M not lyin\u0027 now. When I saw the gun in Blanchard\u0027s hand, I didn\u0027t have time to think. It was either him or me.\n After it waS done, I ran because I knew I\u0027d killed him. I swear to God that\u0027s how it happened.\"\n \"Oh, Jesus,\" Susan said in a pained voice. \"Where are your Here was the question Dan had known she would ask.\n Did he trust her that the police were not listening? Wouldn\u0027t she have had to sign forms or something to permit them to mn a tap? They were no longer man and wife and had a troubled history, so why would the police assume she wouldn\u0027t tell them if he called? \"Are you going to tell them?\" he asked.\n \"They said if I heard from you, I was to let them know.\"\n \"Are you?\"\n \"They told me you\u0027d be armed and dangerous. They said you might be out of your mind, and you\u0027d probably want money from me.\"\n \"not\u0027s a crock of bullshit. I\u0027m not carryin\u0027 a gun, and I didn\u0027t call you for money.\"\n \"Why did you call me, Dan?\"\n \"I ... I\u0027d like to see Chad.\"\n \"No,\" she said at once. \"Absolutely not.\"\n \"I know you don\u0027t care much for me. I don\u0027t blame you.\n But please believe me, Susan. I don\u0027t want to hurt anybody.\n I\u0027m not dangerous. I made a mistake. Hell, I\u0027ve made a lot of mistakes.\u0027 \"You can fix this one,\" she said. \"You can give yourself up and plead self-defense.\"\n \"Who\u0027s gonna listen to me? Hell, that guard\u0027s gonna say I had the gun stashed in my clothes. The bank\u0027ll stand behind him, \u0027cause they sure won\u0027t admit a sick old vet could get a pistol away from-\" \"Sick?\n What do you mean, sick?\"\n He hadn\u0027t wanted this thing to come up, because he needed no sympathy. \"I\u0027ve got leukemia,\" he said. \"From the Agent Orange, I think. The doctors say I can last maybe two years. Three at the most.\"\n Susan didn\u0027t respond, but he could hear her breathing.\n \"If the police take me, I\u0027ll die in prison,\" he went on. \"I can\u0027t spend the last two years of my LIFE witherin\u0027 away behind bars. I just can\u0027t.\"\n \"You ... you damn fool!\" she suddenly exploded. \"My God! Why didn\u0027t you let me know?\"\n \"It\u0027s not your concern.\"\n \"I could\u0027ve given you some money! We could\u0027ve worked something\u0027 out if you were in trouble! Why\u0027d you keep sendin\u0027 the money for Chad every month?\"\n \"Because he\u0027s my son. Because I owe you. Because I owe him. \"\n \"You were always too stubborn to ask for help! That was always your problem! Why in the name of God couldn\u0027t you\"-her voice cracked, a sound of emotion that astonished Dan-\"couldn\u0027t you break down just a little bit and call me?\"\n \"I\u0027m callin\u0027 you now,\" Dan said. \"Is it too late?\"\n She was silent. Dan waited. Only when he heard her sniffle and clear her throat did he realize she was weeping.\n \"I\u0027ll put Chad on,\" she said.\n \"Please,\" he said before she could leave, \"can\u0027t I see him?\n Just for five minutes? Before I called I thought it\u0027d be enough to hear his voice, but I need to see him, Susan. Isn\u0027t there some way?\"\n \"No. The police told me they\u0027re gonna watch the house all night-\"\n \"Are they out front? Could I slip in the back?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know where they are or how many. All I\u0027ve got is a phone number they gave me. I figure it\u0027s to a mobile phone, and they\u0027re sittin\u0027 in a car somewhere on the street.\"\n \"The thing is,\" Dan said, \"I\u0027d like to see both of you.\n After tonight I\u0027m hitting the road. Maybe I can get out of the country if I\u0027m lucky.\"\n \"Your name and picture\u0027s all over the news. How long do you think it\u0027ll be before somebody recognizes you and the law either tracks you down or shoots you down? You do know about the reward, don\u0027t you?\"\n \"What reward?\"\n \"The president of that banics put fifteen thousand dollars on your head.\"\n Dan couldn\u0027t hold back an edgy laugh. \"Hell, all I was askin\u0027 for was a week\u0027s extension. Now they\u0027re ready to spend fifteen thousand dollars on me? No wonder the economy\u0027s so screwed up.\"\n \"You think this is funny\u0027.?\" Susan snapped, and again her voice was thick with emotion. \"It\u0027s not a damn bit funny!\n Your son\u0027s gonna always know his father was a killer! You think that\u0027s funny, too?\"\n \"No, I don\u0027t. But that\u0027s why I want to see him. I want to expltin things. I want to see his face, and I want him to see mine.\n \"There\u0027s no way, unless you want to give yourself up Dan.\"\n \"Listen ... maybe there is,\" he said, his shoulder pressed against a wall of rough bricks. \"If you\u0027re willing, I mean. It depends on you.\"\n A few seconds passed in which Susan made, no response.\n \"You want to hear the idea?\" he urged.\n \"I can\u0027t make any promises.\"\n \"Just hear me out. When I hang up, dial that number and tell \u0027em I called.\"\n \"What?\"\n \"Tell \u0027em they were right. I\u0027ve got two or three guns and I sound like I\u0027m out of my head. Tell \u0027em I said I was comin\u0027 over to see you as soon as I could get there. Then tell \u0027em you\u0027re afraid to stay in the house and you want to spend the night at a motel.\"\n \", \"That won\u0027t work. They\u0027ll know I\u0027m lyin.\n \"Why will they? They\u0027re not watchin\u0027 you, they\u0027re watching the house. They already believe I\u0027m carrying a load of guns and I\u0027m ravin\u0027 mad, so they\u0027ll want you to get out.\n They\u0027ll probably clear the whole block.\"\n \"They\u0027d follow me, Dan. No, it wouldn\u0027t work.\"\n \"It\u0027s worth a try. They might send a man to follow you to the motel and make sure you get checked in, but likely as not he won\u0027t stay around very long. The only thing is, you\u0027ve got to make \u0027em believe you\u0027re scared to death of me.\"\n \"That used to be true,\" she said.\n \"You\u0027re not still scared of me, are YOU?\"\n \"No, not anymore.\"\n \"All I\u0027m askin\u0027 for is five minutes,\" Dan said. \"Then I\u0027m gone.\"\n She paused, and Dan knew he\u0027d said all he could. At last she sighed heavily. \"I\u0027ll need some time to get a suitcase packed. You want me to call you when we get settled?\"\n \"No, I shouldn\u0027t stay where I am and I don\u0027t have a phone in my room.
