Would you tell her that, please?\"\\n\\n \"Well ... that\u0027d be a lie, wouldn\u0027t it? I mean, you made it loud and clear you think I stand about gut-high to an ant.\"\\n\\n \"That was then. This is now. I think you\u0027re the finest man I\u0027ve ever met. Would you please tell her?\"\\n\\n Pelvis scratched Mama\u0027s chin and cocked his head to one side. A few seconds ticked past, during which a bead of sweat trickled down to the end of Flint\u0027s nose and hung there. Then Pelvis said, \"Yes\u0027m, Mr.\\n\\n Murtaugh\u0027s a friend of mine. \" The woman removed her shotgun from Flint\u0027s forehead.\\n\\n Flint let his breath rattle out and staggered back a couple of steps. \"That\u0027s different, then,\" she said, uncocking the gun.\\n\\n \"Different, if he\u0027s your friend. My name\u0027s Rona, you remember me?\"\\n\\n \"Uh . . .\" Pelvis glanced quickly at Flint, then back to the madwoman. \"I ... believe I . . .\"\\n\\n \"I seen you in Biloxi.\" Her voice trembled with excitement.\\n\\n \"That was in-\" She paused. \"I can\u0027t think when that was, my mind gets funny sometimes. I was sittin\u0027 in the third row. I wrote you a letter.\\n\\n You remember me?\"\\n\\n \"Uh . . .\" He saw Flint nod. \"Yes\u0027m, I believe so.\"\\n\\n \"I sent my name in to that magazine, you know that Tiger Beat magazine was havin\u0027 that contest for a date with you? I sent my name in, and my daddy said I was the biggest fool ever lived but I did anyway and I went to church and prayed I was gonna win. My mama went to live in heaven, that\u0027s what I wrote in my letter.\" She looked down at her dirty overalls. \"Oh, I-I must look a fright!\"\\n\\n \"No ma\u0027am,\" Pelvis said quietly. \"Rona, I mean. You look fine.\"\\n\\n \"You sure have got fat,\" Rona told him. \"They cut your balls off in the army, didn\u0027t they? Then they made you stop singin\u0027 them good songs. They\u0027re the ones fucked up the world. Put up them satellites in outer space so they could read people\u0027s minds. Them monkey-cock suckers! Well, they ain\u0027t getting\u0027 to me no more!\" She tapped her helmet. \"Best protect yourself while you can!\" She let her hand drop, and she looked dazedly back and forth between Flint and Pelvis.\\n\\n \"Am I dreamin\u0027?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"Rona?\" Flint said. \"You mind if I call you Rona?\" She just stared blankly at him. \"We\u0027re lookin\u0027 for somebody. A man and a woman. Did you see anybody pass by here?\"\\n\\n Rona turned her attention to Pelvis again. \"How come they tell such lies about you? That you was takin\u0027 drugs and all? How come they said you died?\"\\n\\n \"I ... just got tired, I reckon,\" Pelvis said. Flint noted that he was standing a little taller, he\u0027d sucked his gut in as much as possible, and he was making his voice sound more like Elvis than ever, with that rockabilly Memphis sneer in it. \"I wanted to go hide someplace.\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh, me, too.\" She nodded. \"I didn\u0027t mean to burn that house down, but the light was so pretty. You know how pretty a light can be when it\u0027s dark all the time? Then they put me in that white car, that white car with the straps, and they took me to that place and stuck pins and needles in my head. But they let me go, and I wanted to hide, too. You want some gumbo? I got some gumbo inside. I made it yesterday.\"\\n\\n \"Rona?\" Flint persisted. \"A man and a woman. Have you seen them?\"\\n\\n \"I seen them grave robbers, stearin\u0027 his boat.\" She motioned across the channel. \"John LeDuc lived there, but he died, Stepped in a cottonmouth nest, that\u0027s what the ranger said.\\n\\n Them grave robbers over there, stearin\u0027 his boat. I hollered at \u0027em, but they didn\u0027t pay no mind.\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh. What do you get to if you keep followin\u0027 this bayou?\"\\n\\n \"Swamp,\" she said as if he were the biggest fool who ever lived.\\n\\n \"Swamp and more swamp. \u0027Cept for Saint Nasty.\"\\n\\n \"Saint Nasty? What\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n \"Where they work on them oil rigs.\" Rona\u0027s gaze was tied on Pelvis. \"I\u0027m dreamin\u0027, ain\u0027t I? My mama comes and visits me sometimes, I know I\u0027m dreamin\u0027 awake. That\u0027s what I\u0027m doin\u0027 now, ain\u0027t that right?\"\\n\\n \"How far is saint Nasty from here?\" Flint asked.\\n\\n \"Four, five miles.\"\\n\\n \"Is there a road out from there?\"\\n\\n \"No road. Just the bayou, goes on to the Gulf.\"\\n\\n \"We need a boat,\" he said. \"How much for yours?\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"How much money?\" He took the opportunity to slip the derringer into his pocket and withdraw the wet bills he\u0027d taken from the girl\u0027s wallet. \"Fifty dollars, will that cover the boat and motor.\"\\n\\n \"Ain\u0027t no gas in that motor,\" she told him. \"That ranger comes \u0027round and visits me, he brings me gas. His name\u0027s Jack, he\u0027s a nice young fella. Only he didn\u0027t come this week. \"\\n\\n \"How about paddles, then? Have you got any?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I got a paddle.\" She narrowed her eyes at Flint. \"I don\u0027t like your looks. I don\u0027t care-if you are his friend and he\u0027s a dream I\u0027m havin\u0027. You got something\u0027 mean in you. \"Sixty dollars,\" Flint said. \"Here\u0027s the cash, right here.\"\\n\\n Rona gave a harsh laugh. \"You\u0027re crazier\u0027n hell. You better watch out, they\u0027ll be stickin\u0027 pins and needles in your head \u0027fore long.\"\\n\\n \"Sooner than you think, lady.\" He shot a scowl at Pelvis.\\n\\n \"Mr. Presley, how about openin\u0027 those golden lips and helpin\u0027 me out a little bit?\"\\n\\n Pelvis was still thinking about two words the madwoman had uttered: Cottonmouth nest. \"We sure do need your boat, Rona,\" he said with genuine conviction. \"It\u0027d be doin\u0027 us a big favor if you\u0027d sell it to us. You can even keep the motor, we\u0027ll just take the boat and paddle.\"\\n\\n Rona didn\u0027t reply for a moment, but Flint could see her chewing on her lower lip as she thought about the proposal.\\n\\n \"Hell,\" she said at last, \"you two ain\u0027t real anyhow, are you?\"\\n\\n She shrugged. \"You can buy the boat, I don\u0027t care.\"\\n\\n \"Good. Here.\" Flint offered sixty dollars to her, and the woman accepted the cash with an age-spotted hand and then sniffed the wet bills. \"We\u0027ll need the paddle, too,\" he told her, and she laughed again as if this were a grand illusion and walked into her shack, the interior of which Flint could see was plastered with newspaper pages and held a cast-iron stove. Flint told Pelvis to help him get the motor unclamped from the boat\u0027s stem, and they were laying it on the platform when Rona returned-without her shotgunbringing a paddle.\\n\\n \"Thank you, ma\u0027am,\" Pelvis said. \"We sure do \u0027predate it.\"\\n\\n \"I got a question for you,\" Rona said as they were getting into the boat. \"Who sent you here? Was it Satan, to make me think I\u0027m losin\u0027 my mind, or God, to give me a thrill?\"\\n\\n Pelvis stared into her leathery face. Behind the football helmet\u0027s protective bar her deep-socketed eyes glinted with what was surely insanity but might also have been-at least for a passing moment-the memory of a teenaged girl in her finest dress, sitting in the third row of a Biloxi auditorium.\\n\\n He worked one of the gaudy fake diamond rings from a finger and pushed it into her palm. \"Darlin\u0027,\" he said, \" you decide.\"\\n\\n Sitting in the stem, Flint untied the rope that @red the boat to the platform and then pushed them off with the paddle. Pelvis took the bow seat, Mama warm and drowsy against his chest. Flint began to stroke steadily toward the center of the channel, where he got them turned southward.\\n\\n He felt the current grasp their hull, and in another moment they were moving at about the pace of a fast walk. When Pelvis looked back at the woman standing in front of her decrepit shack, Flint said acidly, \"Made yourself another fan there, didn\u0027t you, Mr. Presley?\"\\n\\n Pelvis stared straight ahead into the darkness. He pulled in a long breath and slowly released it, and he answered with some grit in his voice. \"You can pucker up and kiss my butt.\"\\n\\n Home Sweet Hellhole In the starfire dark Dan and Arden drifted past other narrower bayous that branched off from the main channel.\\n\\n They saw no other lights or shacks, and it was clear that their detour off the bridge had left LaPierre miles behind.\\n\\n When the mosquitoes found them, there was nothing they could do but take the bites. Something bumped hard against the boat before it swam away, and after his heart had descended from his throat, Dan figured it had been an amorous alligator looking for some scaly tush.\\n\\n He got into a pattern of paddling for three or four minutes and then resting, and he and Arden both cupped their hands and bailed out the water that was seeping up through the hull.\\n\\n He said nothing about this to Arden, but he guessed the boat was a rusty nail or two from coming apart.\\n\\n Most of the pain had cleared from Arden\u0027s head. Her vision had stopped tunneling in and out, but her bones still ached and her fingers found a crusty patch of dried blood in her hair and a lump so sore the lightest pressure on it almost made her sick. Her purse and suitcase were gone, her money, her belongings, her identification, everything lost.\\n\\n Except her life, and the drawstring bag in her right hand. But that was okay, she thought. Maybe it was how things were supposed to be. She was shedding her old skin in preparation for the Bright Girl\u0027s touch. She was casting off the past, and getting ready for the new Arden Halliday to be born.\\n\\n How she would find the Bright Girl in this wilderness she didn\u0027t exactly know, but she had to believe she was close now, very close.\\n\\n When she\u0027d seen the light in the shack\u0027s window back there, she\u0027d thought for a moment they might have found the Bright Girl, but she didn\u0027t think-or she didn\u0027t want to think-that the Bright Girl would choose to live in a tarpaper hovel. Arden hadn\u0027t considered what kind of dwelung the Bright Girl might occupy, but now she envisioned something like a green mansion hidden amid the [email protected] trees, where sunlight streamed through the high branches like liquid gold. Or a houseboat anchored in a clear, still pool somewhere up one of these bayous. But not a dirty tarpaper shack. No, that didn\u0027t suit her image of the Bright Girl, and she refused to believe it.\\n\\n She strained to see through the darkness, thinking-or wishing-that just ahead would be the glow of another lantern and a cluster of squatters\u0027 shacks, somebody to help her find her way. She glanced back at Dan as he slid the paddle into the water again. The man Godprovided, Jupiter had said. She\u0027d never have left the motel with Dan if she hadn\u0027t been clinging to Jupiters instincts about him.\\n\\n Jupiter had always been a mystic; he had the sixth sense about horses, he knew their temperaments and their secret no-es.\\n\\n If he said a docile-looking animal was getting ready to snort and kick, it was wise to move away from the hindquarters And he knew other things, too; if he smelled rain in the midst of a Texas drought, it was time to get out the buckets.\\n\\n He read the sky and the wind and the pain in Arden\u0027s soul; she had come to realize during her years at the youth ranch that Jupiter Krenshaw was connected to the flowing currents of life ira a way she couldn\u0027t fathom. She had trusted and believed him, and now she had to trust and believe he\u0027d been telling her the truth about the Bright Girl, and that he\u0027d seen something in Dan Lambert that no one else could recognize.\\n\\n Sho had to, because there was no turning back.\\n\\n \u0027They drifted on, the skiff being drawn along with the slow but steady current. They passed evidence that others had come this way: a few abandoned and crumbling shacks, a wharf jutting out over the water on rotten pilings, a wrecked and vine 4mped shrimp boat whose prow was jammed between the trunks of two huge moss trees.\\n\\n Dan felt meanness overtalang him, and he caught himself dozing off between stretches of paddling. Arden likewise had begun to close her eyes and rest, fighting thurst but not yet ready to drink any of the water they were gliding through.\\n\\n Dan let himself sleep for only a few minutes at a time, then his internal alarm went off and roused him to lmep the boat from drifting into the half-submerged trees on either side. The water was probably eight or ten feet deep, he figured. Their boat was still in the slow process of sinking, but he went to work bailing with his hands and Arden helped him until their craft had lightened up - \u0027 .\\n\\n Dan noted that the branches overhead were g to unlock and draw apart. In another M\u003dty minutes or go-a little over an hour since they\u0027d set off in the boat-the bayou merged into a wider channel that took a long curve toward the southwest. Heat hotnmg shin2mered in the @, and an oomional fish jumped from the channel\u0027s ebony surface and sped down again. Dan looked at the water in the boat and decided it wasn\u0027t wise to think too much about what might be the depths, \u003dMng those fish want to grow wings. He paddled a few strokes and then rested again, the muscles of his back starting to cramp.\\n\\n \"You want me to paddle awhile?\" Arden asked \"No, I\u0027m all right.\"\\n\\n [email protected] the paddle across his knees, he let the current do the work. He scratched the welts on his forehead where a couple of mosquitoes had been feasting, and he sorely missed his baseball cap. \"How about you?\\n\\n You hangin\u0027 in?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n \"Good.\" He listened to the quiet sound of the hull moving through the water. \"I sure could use a cold six-pack! I wouldn\u0027t kick a pizza out of bed, either.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027H take a pitcher of iced tea with some lime in it,\" she said after a moment of defibemtion. \"And a bowl of strawberry ice cream.\"\\n\\n -A Dan nodded, looking from side to side at the dense walls of foliage that lined the bayou. Yes, he decided; a man could get lost in here and never be found. \"This ought to take us out to the Gulf, sooner or later,\" he said. \"Could be daylight before we get there, though.\" He made out ten forty-four by the luminous hands of his watch. \"Once we clear the swamp, maybe we can find a fishin\u0027camp or something\u0027along the coast. Could be we can find a road and flag a car down, get you a ride out of here.\"\\n\\n \"Get me a ride out? What about you?\"\\n\\n ,Never mind about me. You took a pretty hard knock on the head, you need to see a doctor.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t need a doctor. You know who I need to find.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t start that again!\" he warned. \"Hear me? Wherever Lapierre is, were long past it. I\u0027m getting\u0027 you out of here, then you can do what you please.

It was a hell of a lot of wasted lives is what it was.\\n\\n Lives just thrown away.\\n\\n \"It must\u0027ve been bad,\" Arden said. \"I\u0027ve seen a couple of movies about Vietnam, and it sure wasn\u0027t like Desert Storm, was itr\u0027 \"Nope, it sure wasn\u0027t.\" Movies about Vietnam, he thought, and he lowered his head to hide his half-smile.\\n\\n He\u0027d been forgetting that Arden was all of four years old when he\u0027d shipped to \u0027Nam. \"\\n\\n \"My best time was when I was livin\u0027 on the youth ranch, she said.\\n\\n \"It was a hard place, and you did your chores and toed the line, but it was all right. The others there were like I was. All of us had been through a half-dozen foster homes, and we\u0027d screwed up and gotten in trouble with the law. It was our last chance to get straight, I guess.\\n\\n I hated it at first.\\n\\n Tried to run away a couple of times, but I didn\u0027t get very far.\\n\\n Mr. Richards put me to work cleanin\u0027 out the barn. There were five horses, all of \u0027em old and swaybacked, but they still earned their keep. Jupiter was in charge of the stable, that\u0027s where I met him.\"\\n\\n \"You think a lot of him, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"He was always kind to me. Some of those foster homes I was in ... well, I think solitary confinement in prison would\u0027ve been better.\\n\\n I had trouble, too, because of ... you know ... my mark. Somebody looked at me too long, I was liable to lose my temper and start throwin\u0027 plates and glasses. Which didn\u0027t make me too popular with foster parents. I wasn\u0027t used to being\u0027 treated like I had sense.\" She shrugged. \"I guess I had a lot to prove. But Jupiter took an interest in me. He trusted mo with the horses, started lattin\u0027 me feed and groom \u0027em. After a while, when I\u0027d wake up early mornin\u0027s I could hear\u0027em callin\u0027for me, wantin\u0027me to hurry up. You know, all horses have got different personalities and different voices, not a one of \u0027em alike. Some of \u0027em come right out of the stall to meet you, others are shy and hang back. And when they look at you they don\u0027t care if you\u0027re ugly or deformed. They don\u0027t judge you by a mark on your face, like people do.\"\\n\\n \"Not all people,\" Dan said.\\n\\n \"Enough to hurt,\" she answered. She looked up at the stars for a moment, and Dan went to work with the paddle once more. \"It was a good feelin\u0027, to wake up and hear the horses caRin\u0027.you,\" she went on. \"It was the first time I ever felt needed, or that I was worth a damn.\\n\\n After the work was done, Jupiter and I started havin\u0027 long talks.\\n\\n About life, and God, and stuff I\u0027d never cared to think much about. He never mentioned my mark; he let me get to it in my own time. It took me a while to talk about it, and how I wished more than anything in the world I could be rid of it. Then he told me about the Bright Girl.\"\\n\\n Dan said nothing; he was listening, but on this subject it was hard not to turn a deaf ear.\\n\\n \"I never really expected I\u0027d ever be lookin\u0027 for her,\" Arden said.\\n\\n \"But the way Jupiter talked about her ... she seemed like somebody I\u0027d know, if I ever found her. She seemed so real, and so alive. I mean, I know it sounds crazy for somebody to live so long and never get old.\\n\\n I know the faith healers on TV are frauds tryin\u0027 to squeeze out the bucks. But Jupiter would never have lied to me.\" She caught Dan\u0027s gaze and held it. \"if he said there\u0027s a Bright Girl, there is. And if he said she can touch my mark and take it away, she can. He would never have lied. And he was right about you, too. If he said you\u0027re the man God sent to help me find her, then I be-\" \"Stop it!\" Dan interrupted sharply. \"I told you I didn\u0027t want to hear that\"-bullshit, he almost said, but he settled on-\"junk.\"\\n\\n She started to fire back a heated reply, but she closed her mouth.\\n\\n She just stared at him, her eyes fixed on his.\\n\\n Dan said, \"You\u0027re chasin\u0027 a fairy tale. Where it\u0027s gotten you?\\n\\n Do you think you\u0027re better off than before you left Fort Worth? No, you\u0027re worse off. At least you had some money in the bank. I don\u0027t want to hear any more about the Bright Girl, or what Jupiter told you, or any of that. Understand?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gone-south/page-20.html","bookId":2479,"book":{"id":2479,"title":"Gone South","description":"Storyline: Flooded by memories, poisoned by Agent Orange, Dan Lambert kills a man in a moment of fear and fury -- and changes his life forever.
