{"id":83638,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"\"Hell, fightin\u0027s fightin\u0027. Jungle or desert, what\u0027s the difference?\"\\n\\n The pain was getting bad now. Dan\u0027s guts were clenched up. \"A lot,\" he said. \"In the desert you can see who\u0027s shootin\u0027 at you.\" His gaze ticked to the Lucite cube that held the plastic flag. Something small was stamped on its lower left corner. Three words. He leaned forward to read them.\\n\\n Made in China.\\n\\n \"Health problem,\" Blanchard said.\\n\\n \"What?\" \"Health problem. Says so right here. What\u0027s your health problem, Mr. Lambert?\"\\n\\n Dan remained silent.\\n\\n Blanchard turned around. \"You sick, or not?\"\\n\\n Dan put one hand up against his forehead. Oh, Jesus, he thought.\\n\\n To have to bare himself before a stranger this way was almost too much for him.\\n\\n \"You aren\u0027t on drugs, are you?\" Blanchard\u0027s voice had taken on a cutting edge. \"We could\u0027ve cleaned house over there if so many of you fellas hadn\u0027t been on drugs.\"\\n\\n Dan looked into Blanchard\u0027s sweating, heat-puffed face. A jolt of true rage twisted him inside, but he jammed it back down again, where it had been drowsing so long. He in that moment that Blanchard was the kind of man who enjoyed kicking a body when it was beaten. He leaned toward Blanchard\u0027s desk, and slowly he pulled himself out of the black leather chair. \"No, sir,\" he said tersely, \"I\u0027m not on drugs. But yeah, I am sick. If you really want to know, I\u0027ll tell you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m listenin\u0027.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got leukemia,\" Dan said. \"It\u0027s a slow kind, and some days I feel just fine. Other days I can hardly get out of bed.\\n\\n I\u0027ve got a tumor the size of a walnut right about here.\" He tapped the left side of his forehead. \"The doctor says he can operate, but because of where the tumor lies I might lose the feelin\u0027 on my right side. Now, what kind of carpenter would I be if I couldn\u0027t use my right hand or leg.?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry to hear that, but-\" \"I\u0027m not finished,\" Dan said, and Blanchard was quiet\"You wanted to know what was wrong with me, you oughta have the manners to hear the whole story.\" Blanchard chose that moment to glance at the gold Rolex watch on his wrist, and Dan came very close to reaching across the desk and grabbing him by his yellow necktie. \"I want to tell you about a soldier.\" Dan\u0027s voice was roughened by the sandpaper of raw emotion. \"He was a kid, really. The kind of kid who always did what he was told. He drew duty in a sector of jungle that hid an enemy supply route. And it was always rainin\u0027 on that jungle. It was always drippin\u0027 wet, and the ground stayed muddy.\\n\\n It was a silver rain. Sometimes it fell right out of a clear blue sky, and afterward the jungle smelled like flowers gone over to rot. The silver rain fell in torrents, and this young soldier got drenched by it day after day. It was slick and oily, like grease off the bottom of a fryin\u0027 pan. There was no way to get it off the skin, and the heat and the steam just cooked it in deeper.\" Dan drew up a tight, terrible smile. \"He asked his platoon leader about it.\\n\\n His platoon leader said it was harmless, unless you were a tree or a vine. Said you could bathe in it and you\u0027d be all right, but if you dipped a blade of sawgrass in it, that sawgrass would blotch up brown and crispy as quick as you please. Said it was to clear the jungle so we could find the supply route. And this young soldier ... you know what he did?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Blanchard said.\\n\\n \"He went back out in that jungle again. Back out in that dirty rain, whenever they told him to. He could see the jungle dyin\u0027. All of it was shrivelin\u0027 away, being\u0027 burned up without fire. He didn\u0027t feel right about it because he knew a chemical as strong as that had to be bad for skin and bones.\\n\\n He knew it. But he was a good soldier, and he was proud to fight for his country. Do you see?\"\\n\\n \"I think so. Agent Orange?\"\\n\\n \"It could kill a jungle in a week,\" Dan said. \"What it could do to a man didn\u0027t show up until a long time later.\\n\\n That\u0027s what being\u0027 a good soldier did to me, Mr. Blanchard. I came home full of poison, and nobody blew a trumpet or held a parade.\\n\\n I don\u0027t like being\u0027 out of wort I don\u0027t like feelin\u0027 I\u0027m not worth a damn sometimes. But that\u0027s what my LIFE is right now.\"\\n\\n Blanchard nodded. He wouldn\u0027t meet Dan\u0027s eyes. \"I really, truly, am sorry. I swear I am. I know things are tough out there.\"\\n\\n \"Yes sir, they are. That\u0027s why I have to ask you to give me one more week before you take my truck. Without my truck, I don\u0027t have any way to get to a job if one comes open. Can you please help me out?\"\\n\\n Blanchard rested his elbows on his desk and laced his fingers together. He wore a big LSU ring on his right hand.\\n\\n His brows knitted, and he gave a long, heavy sigh. \"I feel for you, Mr. Lambert. God knows I do. But I just can\u0027t give you an extension.\"\\n\\n Dan\u0027s heart had started pounding. He knew he was facing disaster of the darkest shade.\\n\\n \"Look at my position.\" Blanchard\u0027s chewing gum was going ninety miles a minute. \"My superiors kicked Bud Jarrett out of here because of the bad loans he made. They hired me because I don\u0027t make bad loans, and part of my job is to fix the mess Jarrett left behind. One week or one month: I don\u0027t think it would really matter very much, do you?\"\\n\\n \"I need my truck,\" Dan rasped.\\n\\n \"You need a social. worker, not a loan officer. You could get yourself chocked into the VA hospital.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been there. I\u0027m not ready to roll over and die yet.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027\\n\\n [email protected]\\n\\n /* */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t\u003ddocument.currentScript||function(){for(t\u003ddocument.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027),e\u003dt.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\u0027data-cfhash\u0027))return t[e]}();if(t\u0026\u0026(c\u003dt.previousSibling)){p\u003dt.parentNode;if(a\u003dc.getAttribute(\u0027data-cfemail\u0027)){for(e\u003d\u0027\u0027,r\u003d\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(0,2)|0,n\u003d2;a.length-n;n+\u003d2)e+\u003d\u0027%\u0027+(\u00270\u0027+(\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* */\\n\\n , but there\u0027s nothin\u0027 I can do for you.

I\u0027ll be in the office by ten.\" He swiveled around and switched the computer\u0027s screen off, telling Dan that their conversation was over.\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t do it,\" Dan said. \"I won\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"You will, Mr. Lambert, or you\u0027ll find yourself in some serious trouble.\"\\n\\n \"Jesus Christ, man! Don\u0027t you think I\u0027m already in serious trouble? I don\u0027t even have enough money to buy decent groceries! How am I gonna get around without my truck?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re finished, I think. I\u0027d like you to leave now.\"\\n\\n Maybe it was the pain building in Dan\u0027s skull; maybe it was this final flat command from the man who was squeezing the last of the dignity from his life. Whatever it was, it shoved Dan over the edge.\\n\\n He knew he should not. Knew it. But suddenly he was reaching out toward the photographs and the Made in China American flag, and as he gritted his teeth the rage flew from him like a dark bird and he swept everything off the top of Blanchard\u0027s desk in a swelling crash and clatter.\\n\\n \"Hey! Hey!\" Blanchard shouted. \"What\u0027re you doin\u0027?\"\\n\\n \"Serious trouble,\" Dan said. \"You want to see some serious trouble, mister?\" He halted the chair he\u0027d been sitting on and slammed it against the wall. The sign that said The Buck Stops Here fell to the floor, and books jittered on the perfect shelves. Dan picked up the wastebasket, tears of frustration and shame stinging his eyes, and he threw its contents over Blanchard, then flung the wastebasket against the stag\u0027s head. A small voice inside Dan screamed at him to stop, that this was childish and stupid and would earn him nothing, but his body was moving on the power of singleminded fury. If this man was going to take his freedom from him, he would tear the office apart.\\n\\n Blanchard had picked up the telephone. \"Security!\" he yelled.\\n\\n \"Quick!\"\\n\\n Dan grabbed the phone and jerked it away from him, and it too went flying into the shelves. As Dan attacked the fox-hunt pictures, he was aware in a cold, distant place that this was not only about the truck. It was about the cancer in his bones and the growth in his brain, the brutal heart of Death Valley, the jostling for tickets, the dirty silver rain, the major, the village, his failed marriage, the son who had been infected with his father\u0027s poison. It was all those things and more, and Dan tore the pictures off the walls, his face contorted, as Blanchard kept shouting for him to stop. A good soldier, Dan thought as he began pulling the books off the shelves and fringing them wildly around the office. A good soldier good soldier I\u0027ve always been a goodSomeone grabbed him from behind.\\n\\n \"Get him out!\" Blanchard hollered. \"He\u0027s gone crazy!\"\\n\\n A pair of husky arms had clamped around Dan\u0027s chest, pinning his own arms at his sides. Dan thrashed to break free, but the security guard was strong. The grip tightened, forcing the air from Dan\u0027s lungs. \"Get him outta here!\"\\n\\n Blanchard had wedged himself into a corner, his face mottled with red. \"Faye, call the police!\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir!\" She\u0027d been standing in the open door, and she hurried to the phone on her desk.\\n\\n Dan kept fighting. He couldn\u0027t stand to be confined, the pressure on his chest driving him to further heights of frenzy. \"Hold still, damn it!\" the guard said, and he began dragging Dan to the door.\\n\\n \"Come on, you\u0027re goin\u0027 with-\" Panic made Dan snap his head backward, and the guard\u0027s nose popped as bone met cartilage. The man gave a wounded grunt, and suddenly Dan was free. As Dan turned toward him, he saw the guard-a man as big as a football linebacker, wearing a gray uniform-sitting on his knees on the carpet. His cap had spun away, his black hair cropped in a severe crew cut, his hands cupped over his nose with blood leaking between the sausage-thick fingers. \"You busted my nose!\" he gasped, his eyes slatted and wet with pain. \"You sumbitch, you busted my nose!\"\\n\\n The sight of blood skidded Dan back to reality. He hadn\u0027t meant to hurt anyone; he hadn\u0027t meant to tear up this man\u0027s office. He was in a bad dream, and surely he must soon wake UP.\\n\\n But the bad dream took another, more wicked turn.\\n\\n \"You sumbitch,\" the guard said again, and he reached with bloody fingers to the pistol in a holster at his waist. He pulled the gun loose, snapping off the safety as it cleared the leather.\\n\\n Going to shoot me, Dan thought. He saw the man\u0027s finger on the trigger. For an instant the smell of ozone came to him-a memory of danger in the silver-dripping jungle and the flesh prickled at the back of his neck.\\n\\n He lunged for the guard, seized the man\u0027s wrist, and twisted the gun aside. The guard reached up with his free hand to claw at Dan\u0027s eyes, but Dan hung on. He heard Mrs.\\n\\n Duvall shout, \"The police are comin\u0027!\" The guard was trying to get to his feet; a punch caught Dan in the rib cage and almost toppled him, but still he held on to the guard\u0027s wrist. Another punch was coming, and Dan snapped his left hand forward with the palm out and smashed the man\u0027s bleeding nose. As the guard bellowed and fell back, Dan wrenched the pistol loose. He got his hand on the grip and fumbled to snap the safety on again.\\n\\n He heard a click behind him.\\n\\n He knew that sound.\\n\\n Death had found him. It had slid from its hole here in this sweltering office, and it was about to sink its fangs.\\n\\n Dan whirled around. Blanchard had opened a desk drawer and was lifting a pistol to take aim, the hammer cocked back and a finger on the trigger. Blanchard\u0027s face was terrified, and Dan knew the man meant to kill him.\\n\\n It took a second.\\n\\n One second.\\n\\n Something as old as survival took hold of Dan. Something ancient and unthinking, and it swept Dan\u0027s sense aside in a feverish rush.\\n\\n He fired without aiming. The pistol\u0027s crack vibrated through his hand, up his snake-tattooed forearm and into his shoulder.\\n\\n \"Uh,\" Blanchard said.\\n\\n Blood spurted from a hole in his throat.\\n\\n Blanchard staggered back, his yellow necktie turning scarlet. His gun went off, and Dan flinched as he heard the bullet hiss past his head and thunk into the door jamb. Then Blanchard crashed to the floor amid the family photographs, fox-hunt prints, and leather-bound books.\\n\\n Mrs. Duvall screamed.\\n\\n Dan heard someone moan. It was not Blanchard, nor the guard. He looked at the pistol in his hand, then at the splatter of red that lay across Blanchard\u0027s desk. \"Oh, God,\" Dan said as the horror of what he\u0027d just done hit him full force. \"Oh, my God ... no . . .\"\\n\\n The gears of the universe seemed to shift. Everything shut down.to a hazy slow-motion. Dan was aware of the guard cowering against a wall. Mrs. Duvall fled into the corridor, still shrieking.\\n\\n Then Dan felt himself moving around the desk toward Blanchard, and though he knew he was moving as fast as he could, it was more like a strange, disembodied drifting. Bright red arterial blood was pulsing from Blanchard\u0027s throat in rhythm with his heart. Dan dropped the pistol, got down on his knees, and pressed ]Iis hands against the wound. \"No!\" Dan said, as if to a disobedient child. \"No!\"\\n\\n Blanchard stared up at him, his chilly blue eyes glazed and his mouth half open. The blood kept spurting, flowing between Dan\u0027s fingers.\\n\\n Blanchard shuddered, his legs moving feebly, his heels plowing the carpet. He coughed once. A red glob of chewing gum rolled from his mouth, followed by rivulets of blood that streamed over his lower lip.\\n\\n \"No oh God no please no don\u0027t die,\" Dan began to beg.\\n\\n Something broke inside him, and the tears ran out. He was trying to stop the bleeding, trying to hold the blood back, but it was a tide that would not be turned. \"Call an ambulance!\" he shouted. The guard didn\u0027t move; without his gun the man\u0027s courage had crumpled like cheap tin.\\n\\n \"Somebody call an ambulance!\" Dan pleaded. \"Hang on!\"\\n\\n he told Blanchard. \"Do you hear? Hang on!\"\\n\\n Blanchard had begun making a harsh hitching noise deep in his chest. The sound filled Dan with fresh terror. He knew what it was.\\n\\n He heard it before, in \u0027Nam: the death watch, ticking.\\n\\n The police, Mrs. Duvall had said.\\n\\n The police are comin\u0027.\\n\\n Blanchard\u0027s face was white and waxen, his tie and shirt soaked with gore. The blood was still pulsing, but Blanchard\u0027s eyes stared at nothing.\\n\\n Murder, Dan realized. Oh Jesus, I\u0027ve murdered him.\\n\\n No ambulance could make it in time. He knew it. The bullet had done too much damage. \"I\u0027m sorry, I\u0027m sorry,\" Dan said, his voice cracking. His eyes blurred up with tears.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, dear God I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n The police are comin\u0027.\\n\\n The image of handcuffs and iron bars came to him. He saw his future, confined behind stone walls topped with barbed wire.\\n\\n There was nothing more he could do.\\n\\n Dan stood up, the room slowly spinning around him. He looked at his bloodied hands, and smelled the odor of a slaughterhouse.\\n\\n He ran, past the guard and out of the office. Standing in the corridor were people who\u0027d emerged from their own offices, but when they saw Dan\u0027s bloody shirt and his gray-tinged face they scurried out of his way. He ran past the elevator, heading for the stairwell.\\n\\n At the bottom of the stairwell were two doors, one leading back into the teller\u0027s area and another with a sign that said EMERGENCY Exrr ONLY! ALARM WILL SOUND! As Dan shoved the exit door open, a high-pitched alarm went off in his ear.\\n\\n Searing sunlight hit him; he was facing the parking lot beside the bank. His truck was in a space twenty yards away, past the automatic teller machine and the drive-up windows. There was no sign yet of a police car. He ran to his truck, frantically unlocked the door, and slid behind the wheel. TWo men, neither of them a police officer, came out of the emergency exit and stood gawking as Dan started the engine, put the truck into reverse, and backed out of the parking space. His brakes shrieked when he stomped on the pedal to keep from smashing the car parked behind him.\\n\\n Then he twisted the wheel and sped out of the lot, and with another scream of brakes and tires he took a left on the street. A glance in his rearview mirror showed a police car, its bubble lights spinning, pulling up to the curb in front of the building. He had no sooner focused his attention on the street ahead than a second police car flashed past him, trailing a siren\u0027s wail, in the direction of the bank.\\n\\n Dan didn\u0027t know how much time he had. His apartment was five miles to the west. Beads of sweat clung to his face, blood smeared all over the steering wheel.\\n\\n A sob welled up and clutched his throat.\\n\\n He cried, silently.\\n\\n He had always tried to live right. To be fair. To obey orders and be a good soldier no matter what slid out of this world full of snake holes.\\n\\n As he drove to his apartment, fighting the awful urge to sink his foot to the floorboard, he realized what one stupid, senseless second had wrought.\\n\\n I\u0027ve gone south, he thought. He wiped his eyes with his snake-clad forearm, the metallic smell of blood sickening him in the hellish August heat. Gone south, after all this time.\\n\\n And he knew, as well, that he\u0027d just taken the first step of a journey from which there could be no return.\\n\\n Mark of Cain Hurry! Dan told himself as he pulled clothes from a dresser drawer and jammed them into a duffel bag. Mavin\u0027too slow huny they\u0027ll be here soon any minute now ...\\n\\n The sound of a distant siren shocked his heart. He stood still, listening, as his pulse rioted. A precious few seconds passed before he realized the sound was coming through the wall from Mr. Wycoffs apartment. The television set. Mr.\\n\\n Wycoff, a retired steelworker, always watched the Starsky and Hutch reruns that came on every day at three-thirty.\\n\\n Dan turned his mind away from the sound and kept packing, pain like an iron spike throbbing in his skull.\\n\\n He had torn off the bloody shirt, hastily scrubbed his hands in the bathroom\u0027s sink, and struggled into a clean white T-shirt. He didn\u0027t have time to change his pants or his shoes,l his nerves were shredding with each lost second. He pushed a pair of blue jeans into the duffel bag, then picked up his dark blue baseball cap from the dressers top and put it on. A framed photograph of his son, Chad, taken ten years ago when the boy was seven, caught his attention and it too went into the bag. Dan went to the closet, reached UP to the top shelf, and brought down the shoebox that held thirty-eight dollars, all his money in the world. As he was shoving the money into his pocket, the telephone rang.\\n\\n The answering machine-a Radio Shack special Mark of Cain clicked on after three rings. Dan heard his own voice asking the caller to leave a message.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m callin\u0027 about your ad in the paper,\" a man said. \"I need my backyard fenced in, and I was wonderin\u0027-\" Dan might have laughed if he didn\u0027t feel the rage of the law bearing down on him.\\n\\n could th -if you d do e job and what you\u0027d charge. If you\u0027d call me back sometime today I\u0027d appreciate it. My number\u0027s . .\\n\\n Too late. Much, much too late.\\n\\n He zipped the bag shut, picked it up, and got out.\\n\\n There were no sounds yet of sirens in the air. Dan threw the bag into the back of his truck, next to the toolbox and he got behind the wheel and tore out of the parking\u0027lot. He crossed the railroad tracks, drove six blocks east, and saw the signs for Interstate 49 ahead. He swung the pickup onto the ramp that had a sign saying 1-49 SOUTHBOUND.\\n\\n Then he steadily gave the truck more gas, and he merged with the afternoon traffic, leaving the industrial haze of Shreveport at their backs.\\n\\n Killer, he thought. The image of blood spurting from Blanchard\u0027s throat and the man\u0027s waxen face was in his brain, unshakable as gospel.\\n\\n It had all happened SO fast, he felt still in a strange, dreamlike trance. They would lock him away forever for this crime; he would die behind prison walls.\\n\\n But first they had to catch him, because he sure as hell wasn\u0027t giving himself up.\\n\\n He switched on his radio and turned the dial, searching Shreveport\u0027s stations for the news. There was country music, rock \u0027n\u0027 roll, rap, and advertisements but no bulletin yet about a shooting at the First Commercial Bank. But he knew it wouldn\u0027t take long; soon his description and the description of his truck would be all over the airwaves. Not many men bore the tattoo of a snake on their right forearms.\\n\\n He realized that what he\u0027d worn as a badge of pride and courage in \u0027Nam now was akin to the mark of Cain.\\n\\n Tears were scorching his eyes again. He blinked them away. The time for weeping was over. He had committed the most stupid, insane act of his life; he had gone south in a way he would never have thought possible. His gaze kept flicking to the rearview mirror, and he expected to see flashing lights coming after him. They weren\u0027t there yet, but they were hunting for him by now.\\n\\n The first place they\u0027d go would be the apartment. They would\u0027ve gotten all the information about him from the bank\u0027s computer records.\\n\\n How long would it take for the state troopers to get his license number and be on the lookout for a metallic-mist Chevrolet pickup truck with a killer at the wheel?\\n\\n A desperate thought hit him: maybe Blanchard hadn\u0027t died.\\n\\n Maybe an ambulance had gotten there in time. Maybe the paramedics had somehow been able to stop the bleeding and get Blanchard to the hospital. Then the charge wouldn\u0027t be murder, would it? In a couple of weeks Blanchard could leave the hospital and go home to his wife and children. Dan could plead temporary insanity, because that\u0027s surely what it had been. He would spend some time in jail, yes, but there\u0027d be a light at the end of the tunnel. Maybe. MayA horn blew, jarring him back to reality. He\u0027d been drifting into the next lane, and a cream-colored Buick swept past him with a furious whoosh.\\n\\n He passed the intersection of the Industrial Loop Expressway, and was moving through the outskirts of Shreveport.\\n\\n Subdivisions of blocky tract houses, strip mall, and apartment complexes stood near warehouses and factories with vast parking lots.\\n\\n The land was flat, its summer green bleached to a grayish hue by the merciless sun. Ahead of him, the long, straight highway shimmered and crows circled over small animals that had been mangled by heavy wheels.\\n\\n It came to Dan that he didn\u0027t know where he was going.\\n\\n He knew the direction, yes, but not the destination. Does it matter? he asked himself. All he knew is, he had to get as far from Shreveport as he could. A glance at the gas gauge showed him the tank was a little over a quarter full. The Chevy got good gas mileage for a pickup truck; that was one Mark of cain of the reasons he\u0027d bought it. But how far could he get with thirty-eight dollars and some change in his pocket?\\n\\n His heart jumped. A state trooper\u0027s car was approaching, heading north on the other side of the median. He watched it come nearer, all the spit drying up in his mouth. Then the car was passing him, doing a steady fifty-five. Had the trooper b him d the wh I looked at m? D kept watch, the rearview mirrOr, but the trooper car\u0027s brake lights didn\u0027t flare. But what if the trooper had recognized the pickup truck and radioed to another highway patrol car waiting farther south? on this interstate the troopers could be massing in a roadblock just through the next heat shimmer.\\n\\n He was going to have to get off 1-49 and take a lesser-traveled Parish road. Another four miles rolled under the tires before he saw the exit Of highway 175, heading south toward the town Of Mansfield.\\n\\n Dan slowed his speed and eared onto the ramp, which turned into a two-lane road bordered by thick stands of pines and palmettos. As he\u0027d figured, this route was all but deserted, just a couple of cars visible far ahead and none at his back. Still, he drove the speed limit and watched warily for the highway patrol.\\n\\n Now he was going to have to decide where to go. The Texas line was about twenty miles to the west. He could be in Mexico in fifteen hours or so. If he continued on this road, he would reach the bayous and swampland on the edge of the Gulf in a little over three hours. He could get to the Gulf and head either west to Port Arthur or east to New Orleans. And what then? Go into hiding?\\n\\n Find a job? Make up a new identity, shave Off his beard, bleach out the tattoo?\\n\\n He could go to Alexandria, he thought. That city was less than a hundred miles away, just below the heart of louisiana. He\u0027d lived there for nine years, when he\u0027d been working with FOrdham construction.\\n\\n His ex-wife and son lived there still, in the house on Jackson Avenue.\\n\\n Right. His mouthed into a grim line. The police would have that address too, from the bank\u0027s recorcls. Dan had faithfully made his child support payments every month. If he went to that house, the POlice would swarm all over him. And besides, Susan was so afraid of him anyway that she wouldn\u0027t let him in the door even if he came as a choirboy instead of a killer. He hadn\u0027t seen his ex-wife and seventeen-year-old son in over six years. It had been better that way, because his divorce was still an open wound.\\n\\n He wondered what the other Snake Handlers would think of a father who had attacked his own little boy in the middle of the night. Did it matter that in those days Dan had been half crazy and suffered nightmarish flashbacks? Did it matter that when he\u0027d put his hands around the boy\u0027s throat he\u0027d believed he was trying to choke to death a VietCong sniper in the silver-puddled mud?\\n\\n No, it didn\u0027t. He remembered coming out of the flashback to Susan\u0027s scream; he remembered the stark terror on Chad\u0027s tear-streaked face. Ten seconds more-just tenand he might have killed his own son.\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t blame Susan for wanting to be rid of him, and so he hadn\u0027t contested the divorce.\\n\\n He caught himself-, the truck was drifting toward the centerline again as his attention wandered, He saw some dried blood between his fingers that he\u0027d missed with the soap and rag, and the image of Blanchard\u0027s bleached face stabbed him.\\n\\n A glance in the rearview mirror almost stopped his heart entirely.\\n\\n Speeding after him was a vehicle with its lights flashing. Dan hesitated between jamming the accelerator and hitting the brake, but before he could decide to do either, a cherry-red pickup truck with two grinning teenagers in the cab roared past him and the boy on the passenger side stuck a hand out with the middle finger pointed skyward.\\n\\n Dan started trembling. He couldn\u0027t stop it. Sickness roiled in his stomach, a maniacal drumbeat trapped in his skull.
