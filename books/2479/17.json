You want me to tell you how to get there? It\u0027s not far.\"\\n\\n The walls were closing in on her. She had to get out of there, had to find a place to think. \u0027ICon I take this?\" She held the newspaper\u0027s page so the woman couldn\u0027t see Dan\u0027s picture.\\n\\n \"Sure, I\u0027m through with it. Don\u0027t you want the-I, Arden was already going out the door.\\n\\n \"Guess not,\" the woman said when the door closed. She\u0027d wanted to ask the girl if that mark on her face hurt, but she\u0027d decided that wouldn\u0027t be proper. It was a shame-, that Rirl would\u0027ve been so pretty if she weren\u0027t disfigured \u0027 - But that was life, wasn\u0027t it? You had to take the bad with the good, and make the best of it. Still it was a terrible shame.\\n\\n She turned her attention again to the crossword puzzle.\\n\\n The next word across was four letters, and its clue was \"destiny.\"\\n\\n The Truth Dan had stepped out of the shower and was toweling off when he heard someone speak his name.\\n\\n He looked at the television set. His face-his drivers license picture-was looking back at him from the screen.\\n\\n He thought he\u0027d been prepared for the shock, but he was wrong; in that instant he felt as if he\u0027d simultaneously taken ,a gut punch and had icy water poured on the back of his neck. The newscaster was talking about the shooting of Emory Blanchard, and the camera showed scenes of policemen at the First Commercial Bank. And then the vision truly became nightmarish, because suddenly a distraught face framed with kinky red curls was talking into a reporter\u0027s microphone.\\n\\n \"He went crazy when he found out we knew who he was,\" Hannah DeCayne was saying. . \"Harmon and me tried to stop him, but he was out of his mind. Grabbed the shotgun away from Harmon and blasted him right there in front of me, and then he-oh, dear Lord, it was terrible-then he started beaten\u0027 my husband in the head with the gun.\\n\\n I never saw anybody so wild in my life, there wasn\u0027t a thing I could do!\"\\n\\n The camera showed the dismal Hideaway Motor Court in daylight, then focused on the crippled pickup truck. There was a shot of blood on the sandy ground. \"DeCayne was pronounced dead early this morning at an Alexandria hospital,\" the newscaster said.\\n\\n Dan\u0027s knees gave way. He sat down on the edge of the bed, his mouth agape.\\n\\n \"Police believe Lambert may be on his way to Naples, Florida, where his nearest family member lives . . .\"\\n\\n Christ! Dan thought. They\u0027d brought his mother into this thing now!\\n\\n \". - - but there\u0027ve been reports that Lambert\u0027s been seen both in New Orleans and Baton Rouge. Repeating what we understand from Alexandria police, Lambert may be traveling under the name Farrow, and he should be considered extremely dangerous. Again, the First Commercial Bank of Shreveport has put a fifteen-thousand.\\n\\n dollar reward on Lambert, and the number to call with information is 555-9045.\" The photograph of Dan came up on the screen again.\\n\\n \"Lambert is fortytwo years old, has brown hair and brown eyes and\\n\\n [email protected]\"\\n\\n Dan got up and snapped the TV off. Then he had to sit down once more because his bones reft rubbery and his head was reeling. Anger started boiling up inside him. What kind of damned shit was that woman trying to shovel? No, not trying, she was doing a pretty good job of it, fake tears and all. Dan saw what had happened. The bitch had killed her husband, and who was going to call her a @? He sensed the net starting to close around him. Who would believe he hadn\u0027t murdered DeCayne? Pretty soon the newscasts were going to make him out to be a bloodthirsty fiend who killed everybody in his path. With his picture on TV, the reward, the police looking for the station wagon-what chance did he have of getting to Vermilion, much less out of the country?\\n\\n He clasped his hands to his face. His heart was beating hard, the pulse pounding at his temples. How much farther could he get? Even traveling with the shield of darkness he knew it was only a matter of time now before the law found him. And his time, it seemed, was fast ticking away. Should he try to keep going, or just give it up and call the police?\\n\\n What was the point of running anymore? There war, no escaping prison; there was no escaping the disease that was .chewing his life away. Gone south, gone south, he thought.\\n\\n Where could you run to when all roads were blocked?\\n\\n He didn\u0027t know how long he sat there, his eyes squeezed shut and his head bowed, his thoughts scrambling like mice in mazes. There was a tentative knock at the door. Dan didn\u0027t say anything. The knock came again, a little louder this time.\\n\\n \"Go away!\" he said. It had to be her. Or the police. He\u0027d find out soon enough.\\n\\n A long silence followed. Then her voice: \"I ... want to talk to you for a minute.\"\\n\\n \"Just go away and leave me alone. Please.\"\\n\\n She was silent, and Dan thought she\u0027d gone. But then he heard a rustling at the bottom of the door and something slid under it into the room. It was a newspaper page.\\n\\n Dan had the feeling that the bad news was about to get worse. He put the towel around his waist, went to the door, and picked up the page. There at the lower right was his picture, the same photo he\u0027d seen on television. Second Murder Attributed to Shreveport Fugitive, the headline read. He reached out, unlatched the door, and pulled it open.\\n\\n Arden took a backward step, half of her face pale with fear, and she lifted a tire iron she\u0027d taken from the back of the station wagon over her head. \"Don\u0027t touch me,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll knock your head in!\"\\n\\n They stared at each other for a few seconds, like two wary and frightened animals. At last Dan said, \"Well, you\u0027ve got my attention.\\n\\n What\u0027d you want to talk about?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s you, isn\u0027t it? You killed two people?\\n\\n \"It\u0027s me,\" he answered. \"But I didn\u0027t kill two people. Just the man in Shreveport.\"\\n\\n -Oh, is that supposed to make me feel better?\"\\n\\n \"Right now I don\u0027t give a damn what you feel. You\u0027re not the one goin\u0027 to prison. I guess you\u0027ve already called the police?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe I have,\" she said. \"Maybe I haven\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"You saw there\u0027s fifteen thousand dollars reward on me, didn\u0027t you? That ought to be enough to get your birth mark off. See?\\n\\n This must be your lucky day.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t try to rush me,\" she warned. \"I swear I\u0027ll hit you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not rushin\u0027 anybody. Where am I gonna go wearin\u0027 a towel?\\n\\n You mind if I get dressed before the police get here?\"\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t called \u0027em. Not yet, I mean.\"\\n\\n \"Well, do what you have to do. I figure I\u0027m through runnin\u0027.\" He turned his back on her and went to his clothes, which were lying on a chair near the bathroom door.\\n\\n Arden didn\u0027t enter the room. She watched him as he \u0027dropped the towel and put on his underwear and socks. His body was thin and sinewy, the vertebrae visible down his spine. His muscles looked shrunken and wasted. There was nothing physically threatening about him at all. Arden \u0027lowered the tire iron, but she didn\u0027t cross the threshold. Dan put on his T-shirt and then his jeans. He sat down in the chair to slip his shoes on. \"I didn\u0027t kill the man in Alexandria,\"\\n\\n he told her. \"For what it\u0027s worth, his wife did it and she\u0027s blamin\u0027 me. Yeah, I did steal their station wagon, only because the damn woman shot my pickup truck\u0027s tire out. She blasted him with a shotgun, aimin\u0027 at me, but when I left there he was still alive. She beat him to death and she\u0027s tellin\u0027 the police I did it. That\u0027s the truth.\"\\n\\n Arden swallowed thickly, the fear still fluttering around in her throat. \"The paper said you went crazy in a bank. Shot a man dead.\\n\\n That you\u0027re supposed to be armed and dangerous. \"\\n\\n \"They got the crazy part right. Bank was repossessin\u0027 my truck.\\n\\n It was the last thing I had left. I got in a fight with a guard, the loan manager pulled a pistol on me, and ... it @just happened. But I\u0027m not armed, and I never was carryin\u0027 a gun. I guess I ought to be flattered that they think l\u0027 in so dangerous, but they\u0027re wrong.\" He sat back in the chair and put his hands on the armrests. \"I meant it about the reward money. Ought to be you who gets it as much as anybody else. You want to go call the law, I\u0027ll be right here.\"\\n\\n Her common sense told her to go to her room and use the phone there, but she hesitated. \"How come you didn\u0027t give yourself up after you shot that man?\"\\n\\n \"I panicked. Couldn\u0027t think straight. But I was tellin\u0027 you the truth about the leukemia. The doctors don\u0027t give me a whole lot of time, and I don\u0027t care to pass it in prison.\"\\n\\n \"So how come you\u0027re just gonna sit there and let me, turn you in?\"\\n\\n \"Somebody will, sooner or later. I thought I could get out of the country, but ... there\u0027s no use in tryin\u0027 to run when your name and face is plastered all over TV and the newspapers. It\u0027s just hurtful to my family.\"\\n\\n \"Your family? You married?\"\\n\\n \"Ex-wife. A son. I stopped to see\u0027em in Alexandria, that\u0027s why I was stayin\u0027 at that damn motel. I was headin\u0027 to a place called Vermilion. Cabin down there I was gonna hide in for a while, until I could decide what to do.\" He shook his head. \"No use in it.\"\\n\\n Arden didn\u0027t know exactly what she\u0027d expected, but this wasn\u0027t it.\\n\\n After she\u0027d digested the newspaper story, she\u0027d gone to the station wagon to search it, looking for a gun.\\n\\n She\u0027d found the tire iron in the back and in the glove compartment a couple of old receipts-for froglegs, of all things-made out to Hannah DeCayne from the Blue Gulf Restaurant. The hell of this thing was that the fifteen thousand dollars would bail her out of her financial troubles and buy her a car, but after the bills were paid off there still wouldn\u0027t be enough left for the plastic surgery. The doctors had told her there would have to be two or more operations, and they couldn\u0027t promise what the results would be. But here was fifteen thousand dollars sitting in front of her if she wanted it.\\n\\n \"Go on,\" Dan said. \"Call \u0027em, I don\u0027t care.\"\\n\\n \"I will. In a minute.\" She frowned. \"If you\u0027re so sick, why aren\u0027t you in a hospital?\"\\n\\n \"Ever set foot in a V.A. hospital? I was in one for a while.\\n\\n People waitin\u0027 to die, hollerin\u0027 and cryin\u0027 in their sleep. I wasn\u0027t gonna lie there and fade away. Besides, most days I could still work. I\u0027m a carpenter. Was, I mean. Listen, are you gonna call the police, or do you want to write my life story?\"\\n\\n -Arden didn\u0027t answer. She was thinking Of what it had felt like when she was joy-riding in that car she\u0027d stolen!speeding from nowhere to nowhere, tYing to outrace reality -and the state troopers\u0027 car had rDared up behind her with its siren wailing and the bubble light awhirl- She remembered the snap of cuffs on her wrists, and the sharp, dark terror that had pierced her tough fuck-you attitude. She\u0027d had a lot to learn in those days. If it hadn\u0027t been for a few people like Mr. Richards and Jupiter and his wife, the lessons would\u0027ve fallen like seeds on stony ground. Stealing a car was a lot different from committing murder, of course, and maybe Dan Lambert belonged in prison, but Arden wasn\u0027t sure she was the one to Put him there.\\n\\n \"One thing I\u0027d like to do for myself,\" Dan said while she was pondering the situation. He stood up, causing Arden\u0027s heart to start thumping again, and he went to the telephone on the table beside his bed. He dialed the operator and asked for directory assistance in Alexandria.\\n\\n \"Whore you callin\u0027?\" Arden\u0027s knuckles were aching, she was gripping the tire iron so hard.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d like the Police department,\" he said to the Alexandria operator when the call clicked through. \"The main office at City Hall.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027re you doin\u0027?\" Arden asked, incredulous. \"Givin\u0027 -Yourself up?\"\\n\\n \u0027tQuiet,\" he told her. He waited until a voice answered.\\n\\n rg rr di spe @\"Alexandria police, Se rant Gil Pa a ne akin\u0027.\"\\n\\n \"Sergeant, my name is Dan Lambert. I think You people are lookin\u0027 for me.\"\\n\\n There was no reply, just stunned-or suspicious silence. Then: \"Is this a joke?\"\\n\\n \"NO joke- Just listen. I didn\u0027t kill HarmOn DeCayne. I saw wi gu his \u0027fe shoot him with that shot n, but when I left there, he was still alive. She must\u0027ve decided to beat him to death and blame it on me. See what I\u0027m sayinl?\"\\n\\n :\"Uh ... I\u0027m ... ho d on just a minuI\u0027l nn t you to-It 1 te I co ec \"No!\" Dan snapped. \"You pass the phone, I\u0027m gone! I\u0027m tellin\u0027 you, that woman killed her husband. You check the shotgun for fingerprints, you won\u0027t find one of mine on it Will you do that for me?\"\\n\\n \"I-I\u0027ll have to let you talk to Captain-\" \"I\u0027m through talkin\u0027.\"\\n\\n Dan hung up.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t believe you just did that! Don\u0027t you know they\u0027ll trace the call?\"\\n\\n \"I just wanted to start \u0027em thinkin\u0027. Maybe they\u0027ll check for prints and ask that damn woman some more questions.\\n\\n Anyway, they don\u0027t know it wasn\u0027t a local call. There\u0027s enough time for you to turn me in.\"\\n\\n \"Do you want to go to prison? Is that it?\"\\n\\n \"No, I don\u0027t want to go to prison,\" Dan said. \"But I don\u0027t have a whole hell of a lot of choice, do I?\"\\n\\n Arden had to do the next thing; she had to test both herself and him. She took a deep breath, crossed the threshold into his room, and closed the door behind her. She stood with her back against it, the tire iron ready if he jumped at her.\\n\\n He raised his eyebrows. \"Takin\u0027 a risk being\u0027 in a room alone with me, aren\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure yet. Am I?\"\\n\\n He showed her his palms and eased down on the edge of the bed.\\n\\n \"Whatever\u0027s on your mind,\" he told her, \"now\u0027s the time to tell me about it.\"\\n\\n \"All right.\" She took two steps toward him and stopped again, still testing both her own nerves and his intentions. \"I don\u0027t want to turn you in. That\u0027s not gonna help me.\"\\n\\n \"Fifteen thousand dollars is a lot of money,\" he said.\\n\\n \"You could buy yourself-\" \"I want to find the Bright Girl,\" Arden went on. \"That\u0027s why I\u0027m here. Findin\u0027the Bright Girl and getting\u0027this thing off my face is all I\u0027m interested in. Not the money, not why you killed some man in Shreveport.\" Her intense blue gaze didn\u0027t waver.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve seen her in my dreams, only I never could tell what she looked like. But I think I\u0027m close to her now, closer than I\u0027ve ever been. I can\u0027t give it up. Not even for fifteen thousand dollars.\"\\n\\n \"It would pay for an operation, wouldn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"The doctors can\u0027t say for sure they can get it off. They say tryin\u0027 to remove it could leave a scar just as bad as the birthmark.\\n\\n Then where would I be? Maybe war off, if se that\u0027s even possible. No, I\u0027m not doin\u0027 it that way, not when I\u0027m so close.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not thinkin\u0027 straight,\" Dan said. \"The doctors are your best chance. The Bright Girl ... well, you know what I think about that story. \"\\n\\n \"I do. it doesn\u0027t matter. I want you to drive me to LaPierre.\"\\n\\n He grunted. \"Now I know you,re Out Of Your mind! Look I who you\u0027re talkin\u0027 to. I killed a man yesterday. I ve got a stolen car sittin\u0027 out in the parkin\u0027 lot. You don\u0027t know I wouldn\u0027t try to kill you if I could, and you\u0027re wantin\u0027 to travel with me another ninety miles down into the swamp.\\n\\n Wouldn\u0027t you say that might be Pushin\u0027 your luck?\"\\n\\n \"If You were gonna hurt me, You would\u0027ve done it \u0027between here and the truck stop. I believe you about what happened at the motel.\\n\\n There\u0027s not a gun in the car, and You\u0027renotcarryin\u0027one.I\u0027vegota reiron,andlstillthinki ti could outrun you.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe, but you can\u0027t outrun the police. Ever heard of aidin\u0027 and abettin\u0027 a fugitive?\"\\n\\n \"If the police stop us,\" Arden said, \"I\u0027ll say I didn\u0027t know who you were. No skin off your teeth to tell \u0027em the same thing.\\n\\n Dan looked at her long and hard. He figured she \u0027 d had a rough life, and this obsession with the Bright Girl had grown stronger as things had started falling apart- He saw only disappointment ahead for her, but he was in no position to argue. She was right; it was no skin off his teeth. \"You sure about this?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I am.\" The truth was that she hadn\u0027t decided he was worth trusting until he\u0027d made the call to Alexandria. Still, she was going to hang on to the tire iron awhile longer.\\n\\n He stood up and walked toward her. It flashed through her mind to retreat to the door, but she stayed where she was. She knew from experience that once you showed fear to a horse, the animal would never respect you again; she knew it was true with people, too. He reached out for her, and she lifted the tire iron to ward him off.\\n\\n He stopped. \"My cap,\" he said. \"It\u0027s on the chair behind YOU.\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\" She stepped aside to let him get it.\\n\\n Dan put his cap on and checked his wristwatch. Five thirty-four.\\n\\n Outside the window the shadows were lengthening, but it wouldn\u0027t be full dark until after seven. \"I\u0027ll want to travel the back roads,\" he told her. \"A little safer that way, but slower. Less likely to run across a state trooper. I hope. And I\u0027m not gonna jump you, so you can put that thing down.\" He nodded toward the tool in her hand. When she didn\u0027t lower it, he narrowed his eyes and said, \"If you don\u0027t trust me now, just think how you\u0027re gonna feel in a couple of hours when we\u0027re out in the dark and there\u0027s nobody around for miles.\"\\n\\n Arden slowly let her arm fall.\\n\\n \"Okay, good. I\u0027d hate to sneeze and get my brains knocked out.\\n\\n You got any deodorant?\"\\n\\n \u0027Hub?\"\\n\\n \"Deodorant,\" he repeated. \"I need some. And toothpaste or mouthwash, if you\u0027ve got either of those. Aspirin would help, too.\"\\n\\n \"In my suitcase. I\u0027ll bring it over.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s all right, I\u0027ll go with you,\" Dan said, and he saw her stiffen up again. \"My room, your room, or the car, what does it matter?\" he asked. \"Better be certain you want to do this before we get started.\"\\n\\n She realized she was going to have to turn her back on him sooner or later. She said, \"Come on, then,\" and she went out the door first, her stomach doing slow flip-flops.\\n\\n In Arden\u0027s bathroom Dan applied ron-on deodorantand he\u0027d never thought the day would come when he\u0027d be using Secret-and then he wet a washcloth, put a glob of Crest on it, and scrubbed his teeth. Arden brought him a small first aid kit that contained a bottle of Tylenol, a tube of skin ointment, some adhesive bandages, and a bottle of 2m IB eYedrOPS- \"You must\u0027ve been a girl scout,\" Dan said as she shook two aspirin onto his palm.\\n\\n \" Joey always said I missed MY callin\u0027, that I should\u0027ve been a nurse. That\u0027s because I took care of the band when they had hangovers or were too strung out to play. Somebody had to be responsible.\"\\n\\n Dan swallowed the Tylenol tablets with a glass of water and gave her back the first aid kit. \u0027ll need o get me f t so ood and coffee somewhere. Weld better not stick around here too much longer.\"\\n\\n ..I\u0027m ready.\"\\n\\n \u0027it was six o\u0027clock by the time the bill was paid and they were Pulling away from the motel. Arden kept the tire iron on the seat near her right hand, and Dan decided not to make an issue of it. Not far from the motel Dan turned into a McDonald\u0027s and in the drive-through bought three hamburgers, a large order of fries, and a cup of coffee. They sat in the parking lot while he ate, and Dan unfolded the ro-admap and saw that Highway 182 was the route to follow through the towns Of New Iberia, Jeanerette, Baldwin, and on to Morgan City, where Highway 90 would take them deeper into the bayou country to Houma.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027re you gonna go?\",Arden asked when he\u0027d finished the second burger. \"After you take me to LaPierre, I mean. You still gonna try to get out of the country?,\"I don\u0027t know. Maybe.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you have any relatives You could go to? Are your -parents still alive?\\n\\n \"Fatliees dead. My mother\u0027s a ive, but she\u0027s old d I I an don\u0027t want to get her messed up in this. It\u0027ll be hard enough on her as it is.\"\\n\\n \"DOES she know about the leukemia?\"\\n\\n \"No. It\u0027s my problem.\" He speared her with a glance.\\n\\n \"What do you care, anyway? You hardly know me.\"\\n\\n She rugged. \"Just interested, I - You\u0027re e ri t sh guess th rs killer lever met. .\\n\\n Dan couldn\u0027t suppress a grim smile. \"Well, I hope I\u0027m the last one you meet.\" He offered her his french fries. \"Take some.\"\\n\\n She accepted a few and crunched them down. \"You don\u0027t really have anywhere to go, do you?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll find a place.\"\\n\\n Arden nodded vacantly and watched the sun sinking. The Bright Girl-a dream without a face-was on her mind, and if she had to travel with a wanted fugitive to reach that dream, then so be it. She wasn\u0027t afraid. Well, maybe a little afraid. But her life had never been easy, and no one had ever given her a free ticket. She had nowhere to go now but toward the Bright Girl, toward what she felt was the hope of healing and a new start.\\n\\n I know who you are, she recalled Jupiter saying to the killer beside her.\\n\\n You the man God sent Miz Arden.\\n\\n She hoped that was true. She wanted to believe with all her heart it was.\\n\\n Because if Jupiter could be so wrong about Dan Lambert, he could be wrong about the Bright Girl, too.\\n\\n Dan finished his food and they started off again. Four miles south of Lafayette, they passed a state trooper who\u0027d pulled a kid on a motorcycle over to the roadside. The trooper was occupied writing a ticket and they slid by unnoticed, but it was a few minutes before Arden stopped looking nervously back.\\n\\n The light was fading. Purple shadows streamed across the road, and on either side there were woods broken by ponds of brackish water from which tree stumps protruded like shattered teeth. The road narrowed. Traffic thinned to an occasional car or pickup truck. A sign on stilts said KEEP YOUR HEART IN ACADIANA OR GET YOUR-there was the crude drawing of a mule\u0027s hind end here-out. Spanish moss festooned the trees like antebellum lace, and the mingled odors of wild honeysuckle and Gulf salt drifted on the humid air. As the first stars emerged from the darkening sky, heat lightning began to ripple across the southern horizon.\\n\\n Dan switched on the headlights and kept an eye on the rearview mirror. The heat lightning\u0027s flashes reminded him of the battle zone, with artillery shells landing in the 2m A distance. He had the eerie sensation of traveling on a road that led back into time, back into the wet wilderness of a foreign country where the reptiles thrived and death was a silent shadow. He was afraid of what he might find-or what might find him-there, but it was the only road left for him to go. And like it or not, he had to follow it to its end.\\n\\n Black Against Yellow It was just after nine o\u0027clock when the station wagon\u0027s headlight beams grazed a rust-streaked sign that said V ION 5 MI UAC 12 mi @RRE i 5 mi. \"Almost there,\" Dan said, relief blooming in him like a sweet flower.
