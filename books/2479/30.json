But Train kept his fist to the throttle and Baby kept surging forward, ripping through the platform, shattering that sliding glass doors, through the living room, through the prefab walls of Gault\u0027s dream house, and bursting out through the other side. Train jammed the engine into reverse and backed the Swift out between the two halves of the house, and as he cleared the broken walls the insides began to fall out: ahemorrhage of animal-skin-covered furniture, brass lamps, faux marble tables, pinball machines, exercise equipment, chairs, and even the kitchen sink.\n Dan clung to one half of the platform as it groaned and shivered, the walls of the house starting to collapse into the water.

He flung both arms around the television in a desperate embrace, but then the [email protected] beneath his feet slanted as the foundation pilings gave way. The set rolled DOC right into the water, and there was a quick snap, crackle and pop and his body stiffened, smoke tinging his head like a dark halo before he went under.\n \"Dan! Dan! Grab my hand!\"\n It was Arden\u0027s voice. She was @ding at the bows railing, reaching for him as the boat began to back away from the splintered wreckage.\n Dan clenched his @, drawing up his Im reserves of strength.

Bright red blood fountamed up from a severed artery.\n Other arms caught Dan and held him. Gault\u0027s head rose, his mouth open. His hands loosened and slid down Dan\u0027s legs. The muddy, churning water flooded into his mouth and filled up his eyes, then his head disappeared beneath its weight.\n Dan was pulled up over the railing. He saw the faces of Murtaugh and Eisley, and then Arden was beside him and there were tears in her beautiful eyes, her birthmark the color of summer twilight. Her arms went around him, and he could feel her heartbeat pounding against his chest.\n He put his arms around her, too, and hung on.\n Then the darkness swelled up around him.

He was lying on the deck in the shadow of the pilothouse, the engine vibrating smoothly and powerfully beneath him, the blue sky above, the sound of the hull pushing deep water aside.\n A wet rag was pressed to his forehead. Arden looked down at him.\n \"Where are we?\" he whispered, hearing his own voice as if from a great distance.\n \"Train says we\u0027re in Timbalier Bay. We\u0027re gain\u0027to a place called Avrietta\u0027s Island. Here.\" She\u0027d poured some of the filtered water into the cup of her hand, and she supported his head while he drank.\n Someone else-a man without a shirt-knelt beside him.\n Hey, al\u0027 dinosaur you. How you doin\u0027?\"\n \"All right. You?\"\n Train\u0027s face had paled, purplish hollows under his eye \"Been better. Hurtin\u0027 a little bit. See, I knew being\u0027 ugly as ten miles of bad road\u0027s gonna pay off for me someday. That al\u0027 bullet, he say I getting\u0027 in afnd out mighty quick, this fella so ugly. \"You need to get to a hospital.\"\n \"That\u0027s where we bound.\" Train leaned a little closer to him.\n \"Listen, you gonna have to start associatin\u0027 with some more regular fellas, you know what I be sayin\u0027? I take one look at that little bitty hand and arm movin\u0027 \u0027round on that fellas chest, my mouth did the open wide. Then I look at that little bitty head hangin\u0027 down, and I like to bust my teeth when I step on my jaw. And that other fella-the quiet one-he look in the face like somebody I seen, but no way can I figure where.\"\n \"It\u0027ll probably come to you,\" Dan said. He felt his consciousness-a fragile thing-fading away again.\n \"How\u0027d you get \u0027em out? The speedboat?\"\n \"Oui. Skedaddled outta there, fired up Baby and huuuuuwheeee!\n she done some low-level flyin\u0027.\"\n \"You didn\u0027t have to come back.\"\n \"For sure I did. You rest now, we gonna get where we goin\u0027 in twenty, thirty minute.\" He patted Dan\u0027s shoulder and then went away.\n Arden stayed beside Dan and took one of his hands in hers. His eyes closed again, his senses lulled by the throbbing of the engine, the langaid heat, the aroma ana caress of the saltwater breeze sweeping across the deck.\n They passed through clouds of glistening mist. Sea guns wheeled lazily above the boat and then flew onward.\n \"There she is!\" Train called, and Arden looked along the line of the bow.\n They had gone by several other small islands, sandy and flat and stubbled with prickly brush. This one was different.\n It was green and rolling, shaded by tall stands of water oaks.\n There were structures of some kind on it.\n As the boat got nearer, Flint stood at the starboard siderail watching the island grow. He was wearing Train\u0027s T-shirt because he felt more comfortable with Clint undercover and because the sun had blistered his back and shoulders. Train had come up with a first-aid kit from a storage compartment and Flint\u0027s arm wound was bound up with gauze bandages. He had taken off his remaining shoe and his muddied socks and tossed those items overboard like a sacrifice to the swamp.\n Next to him stood Pelvis, his bald pate and face pink with sunburn.\n Pelvis hadn\u0027t spoken more than a few words since they\u0027d gotten aboard; it was clear to Flint that there was a whole lotta thinkin\u0027gain\u0027on in Pelvis\u0027s head.\n Tiuin turned the wheel and gwded them around to the Avrietta\u00273 Island island\u0027s eastern side. They passed spacious green meadows.\n A herd of goats was running free, doing duty as living lawn mowers. There was an orchard with fruit trees, and a few small whitewashed clapboard buildings that looked like utility sheds. And then they came around into a natural harbor with a pier, and there it was.\n Flint heard himself gasp.\n It stood on the green and rolling lawn, there on a rise that must have been the island\u0027s commanding point. It was a large, clean white mansion with multiple chimneys, a fieldstone path meandering between water oaks, and weeping willow trees from the harbor to the house.\n Flint\u0027s heart was racing. He gripped the rail, and tears burned his eyes.\n It was. It was. Oh God, oh Jesus it was ...\n not.\n He realized it in another moment, as they approached the pier.\n There was no stained-glass window in front. The house of his birth had four chimneys; this one had only three. And it wasn\u0027t made of white stone, either. It was clapboard, and the paint was peeling. It was an old antebellum mansion, a huge two-storied thing with columns and wide porches. The rolling emerald-green lawn was the same as in his dreams, yes. A few goats were munching the blades down. But the house ... no.\n He still had a star to follow.\n \"Mr. Murtaugh?\" Pelvis said in a voice that was more Cecil\u0027s than Elvis\u0027s. \"How come you\u0027re cryin\u0027?\"\n \"I\u0027m not cryin\u0027. My eyes are sunburned, that\u0027s all. Aren\u0027t yours?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Well,\" Flint said, and he rubbed the tears away. \"Mine are$ .\n I Train had cut their speed back. The engine was rumbling quietly as they drew closer. So far they\u0027d seen no one. Arden had left Dan to stand at the bow, the breeze blowing through her hair, her eyes ashine with hope. In her right hand was gripped the pink drawstring bag with her little plastic horses in it.\n \"I been wonderin\u0027,\" Pelvis said. \"\u0027Bout what you offered.\"\n \"And what was that? Flint knew, but he\u0027d been shrinking from the memory.\n \"You know. \u0027Bout you being\u0027 my manager and all. I sure could use somebody to help me. I mean, I don\u0027t know how successful I could be, but-I, \"Chopin you\u0027re not,\" Flint said.\n \"He\u0027s dead, ain\u0027t he? Both him and Elvis. Dead as doornails.\"\n He sighed heavily. \"And Mama\u0027s dead, too. It\u0027s gonna take me awhile to get over that one. Maybe I never will, but ... I figure maybe it\u0027s time for Pelvis to be put to rest, too.\"\n Flint looked into the other man\u0027s face. It was amazing how much more intelligent he looked without that ridiculous wig. Dress him up in a nice suit, teach him how to talk without mangling English, teach him some refinements and anners, and maybe a human being of worth would come out of there. But then, it would be an almost impossible task, and he already had a job as a bounty hunter. \"I don\u0027t know, CeciL\"\n Flint said. \"I really don\u0027t.\"\n \"Well, I was just askin\u0027.\" Cecil watched the pier approach.\n \"You gonna take Lambert back to Shreveport?\"\n \"He\u0027s still a killer. Still worth fifteen thousand dollars.\"\n \"Yes sir, that might be true. \u0027Course, if you decided here pretty soon you wanted to like ... give it a try at being\u0027 my manager, helpin\u0027 me get on a diet and get some work and such, then you wouldn\u0027t be a bounty hunter anymore, would you?\"\n \"No,\" Flint said softly. \"I guess I wouldn\u0027t.\" A thought came to him, something the man at the cafe in St. Nasty had said, speaking about Cecil: Hell, I\u0027ll be his manager, then.\n Get out of this damn swamp and get rich, I won\u0027t never look back Maybe he could walk away, he thought. Just walk away.\n From Smoates, from the ugliness, from the degradation. He still had his gambling debts and his taste for gambling that had gotten him so deep in trouble over the years. He couldn\u0027t exactly walk away from those things-those faults Avrletta\u0027s island th -but if he had a purpose and a plan, he could work em out eventually, couldn\u0027t he?\n Maybe. It would be the biggest gamble of his life.\n He found himself stroking his brother\u0027s arm through the T-shirt.\n Clint was as famished as he was. As tired, too. He was going to sleep for a week.\n Get out of this damn swamp andget rich, I won\u0027t never look back.\n He had never been able to get out before, he realized, because he\u0027d never had anything to go to. what if ... ? he wondered.\n What if.7 Maybe those two words were the first steps out of any swamp.\n \"Comin\u0027 close!\" Train called. \"Jump over and tie us up, fellas!\"\n As Flint and Cecil secured the lines to cleats, Train stepped onto the pier and walked to an old bronze bell supported on a post ten feet high. He grasped the bell\u0027s rope and began to ring it, the notes rolling up over the green lawn and through the trees toward the white house on the hill.\n In just a few seconds three figures came out of the house and began to hurry down the path.\n They were nuns, wearing white habits.\n \"Sister Caroline, I sure\u0027null got some hurt people here!\"\n Train said to the one in the lead as they reached the pier.\n \"Got a fella with a hurt leg, one with an arm needs lookin\u0027 at.\n And I do mean lookin\u0027 at. Believe I could use a Band-Aid or two myself, ay?\"\n \"Oh, Train!\" She was a sturdy woman with light brown eyes.\n \"What\u0027s happened to you?\"\n \"Gonna tell you all \u0027bout it later. Can you put us upo\"We always have room. gaster Brenda, will you help Train to the house?\"\n \"No, no, my legs ain\u0027t broke!\" Train said. \"Tend to that man lyin\u0027 there!\"\n Two of the nuns helped Arden get Dan up on his feet.\n Sister Caroline rang the bell a few more times, and two more nuns emerged to answer the call.\n \"What is this place?\" Arden asked Sister Caroline as Dan was taken off the boat.\n The other woman paused, staring at the birthmark. Arden moved so their eyes met. \"This island is the convent of the Order of the Shining Light,\" Sister Caroline answered.\n \"And that\"-and she nodded at the white mansion-\"is the Avrietta Colbert Hospital. May I ask your name?\"\n \"It\u0027s Arden Halliday.\"\n \"From?\"\n \"Fort Worth, Texas.\" Arden turned to Train. \"I thought you told me the Bright Girl lived here!\"\n \"The Bright ... oh, I see.\" Sister Caroline nodded, glancing from Arden to Train and back again. \"Well, I prefer to think we are all bright ... uh ... women.\" She gave Train a hard stare. \"Does she know?\"\n \"Non.\n \"Know what?\" Arden asked. \"What\u0027s goin\u0027 on?\"\n \"We shall see,\" Sister Caroline said flatly, and she turned away to direct the others.\n Dan was being walked up the path supported between two nuns, one a young girl maybe twenty-three, the other a woman in her fifties. The shadows of the oak and willow trees were deliciously cool, and a quartet of goats stood watching the group of pilgrims pass.\n \"Just a minute,\" someone said, beside Dan.\n The nuns stopped. Dan turned his head and found himself face-to-face with Flint Murtaugh.\n Flint cleared his throat. He had his arms crossed over his chest, in case Clint made a spectacle of himself. These fine ladies would get a shock soon enough. \"I want to thank you,\" Flint said.\n \"You saved our lives.\"\n \"You did the same for me.\"\n \"I did what I had to.\"\n \"So did l,\" Dan said.\n They stared at each other, and Flint narrowed his eyes and looked away, then returned his cool blue gaze to Dan.\n \"You know what I ought to do.\"\n \"Yeah.\" Dan nodded. Everything was still blurry around the edges; all of this-the morning\u0027s events, Gault\u0027s strong Avrietta\u0027s Island hold, the gun battle, the Swift severing of the house in two, this green and beautiful island-seemed like bits and pieces of a strange dream. \"Tell me what you\u0027re gonna do.\"\n \"I think-\" Flint paused. He had careful considerations to make.\n He held a man\u0027s future in the balance: his own. \u002741 think ... I\u0027m gonna get out of this damn swam \" he saicl p \"Pardon me, Sisters.\" He looked up the path at the man walking alone. \"Cecil, can I talk to you, please?\" He left Dan\u0027s side, and Dan saw Murtaugh put his hand on Eisley\u0027s shoulder as they began to walk together.\n The closer they got to the house, the more in need of repair Dan saw it was. He counted a half-dozen places where rainwater must be leaking through loose boards. A section of porch railing on the first floor was rotten and sagging, and several of the columns were cracked.\n The place needed repainting, too, otherwise the salt breeze and the damp heat would combine to break down the wood in a very short time.\n He bet the old house had termites, too, chewing at the foundation.\n They needed a carpenter around here, is what they needed.\n Dan tried to put weight on his injured ankle, but the pain made him sick to his stomach. He was getting dizzy again, and his head was pounding. The blurred edges of tuw got still more blurry. He was about to give out, and though he fought it, he knew the sickness eventually had to win.\n \"Sisters?\" he said. \"I\u0027m sorry ... but I\u0027m real near passin\u0027 out.\"\n \"Train!\" the older one shouted. \"Help us!\"\n As Dan\u0027s knees buckled and the darkness rushed up at him once more, he heard Train say, \"Got him, ladies.\" Dan felt himself being lifted over Train\u0027s shoulder in a fireman\u0027s carry before he [email protected] @ut completely, and Train-weak himself but unwilling to let Dan hit the ground-took him the last thirty yards to the house.\n Late afternoon had come.\n Arden was freshly showered and had slept for five solid hours in a four-poster bed in the room Sister Caroline had brought her to, on the antebellum mansion\u0027s first floor.\n Before her shower another nun about Arden\u0027s age had brought her a lunch of celery soup, a ham salad sandwich, and iced tea. When Arden had asked the young woman if the Bright Girl lived here, the nun had given her a tentative smile and left without a word.\n On the way to this room they\u0027d passed through a long ward of beds.\n Most of the beds were in use. Under ceiling fans and crisp white sheets lay some of the patients of the Avrietta Colbert Hospital: a mixture of men, women, and children, white, black, and Latino. Arden had heard the rattling coughs of tuberculosis, the gasping of cancerous lungs, the slow, labored breathing of people who were dying.\n The nuns moved around, giving what comfort they could.\n Some patients were getting better, sitting up and talking-, for others, though, it seemed the days were numbered. Arden heard a few Cajun accents, though certainly not all the patients were of that lineage. She was left with the impression that this might be a charity hospital for the poor, probably from the Gulf Delta area, and that the patients were there because no mainland hospital would accept them or-in the case of the elderly ones who lay dying-waste time on them.\n The same young nun brought Arden a change of clothes: a green hospital gown and cotton slippers. Not long after she\u0027d awakened there\u0027d been a knock at the door, and when she\u0027d opened it there stood a tall, slim man who was maybe in his mid-sixties, wearing a pair of seersucker trousers, a rumpled white short-sleeve shirt, and a dark blue tie. He\u0027d introduced himself in a gentle Cajun accent as Dr.\n Felicien, and he\u0027d sat down in an armchair and asked her how she was feeling, was she comfortable, did she have any aches or pains, things like that. Arden had said she was still tired but otherwise fine; she\u0027d said she had come here to find the Bright Girl, and did he know who she meant?\n \"I most think I do,\" Dr. Felicien had said. \"But I gonna have to beg off and leave that for later. You try to get yourself some more sleep now, heah?\" He\u0027d gone without answering any ftu-ther questions.\n Avrietta\u0027s island A fan turned above her bed. Her window looked out toward the Gulf, and she could see waves rolling in.\n Shadows laY across the lawn. She had figured this room belonged to a doctor or someone else on the staff. When she went in the small but spotless bathroom to draw water from the faucet into a Dixie cup, she looked at her face in the mirror, studying her birthmark as she had a thousand times before.\n She was very, very d.\n What if it had been a lie? All along, a lie? Maybe Jupiter hadn\u0027t been lying, but he\u0027d just been plain wrong. Maybe he\u0027d seen a young and pretty blond woman in Lapierre when he was a little boy, and maybe later on he\u0027d heard the myths about a Bright Girl-a faith healer who could cheat time itself-and he\u0027d mixed up one with the other? But if there was a Bright GirL then who was she, really? Why had Train brought her here, and what was going on?\n She lifted her hand and ran her fingers along the edges of her birthmarl What would she do, she asked herself, if this muk-this bad-luck stain that had ruined her life-had to remain on her face for the rest of her days? What if there was no magic healing touch? No ageless Bright Girl who carried a lamp from God inside her?\n Closing her eyes, Arden leaned her face against the mirror. She\u0027d reft she was so close. So very close. It was a cruel trick, this was.\n Nothing but a cruel, cruel trick.\n Someone knocked at the door. Arden vmnt to open it, thinking that it was probably Dr. Felicien with more questions or the young nun.\n She opened the door and the face that looked at her both startled and horrified her.\n It belonged to a man.. He,had neatly combed sandy-brown hair on the right side of his head, but on the left side there were just tufts of it. A terrible burn and the subsequent healing Process had drawn the skin up into shiny parchment on that left side, his mouth twisted, the left eye sunken in folds of scar tissue. The left ear was a melted nub and the man\u0027s throat was mottled with burn scar. His nose, though scarred, had escaped the worst of the damage, and the right side of his face was almost untouched. Arden stepped back, her own face mirroring the shock she felt, but at once that feeling changed to shame. If anybody understood what it meant to look at someone shrink away from you in a display of ill manners and idiocy, it was she. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gone-south/page-30.html","bookId":2479,"book":{"id":2479,"title":"Gone South","description":"Storyline: \n Flooded by memories, poisoned by Agent Orange, Dan Lambert kills a man in a moment of fear and fury -- and changes his life forever.
