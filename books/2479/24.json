He didn\u0027t have to be afraid anymore of what might be coming up behind him. The idea of getting out of the country, he realized now, had always been an illusion. Sooner or later he would have wound up in handcuffs. He would learn to deal with prison in the time he had left. He was just sorry Arden had gotten mixed up in this. Dan thought Murtaugh was asleep, but suddenly the bounty hunter shifted on his cot and said, \"What the hell made that girl come down here with you, anyway?\" \"She believes there\u0027s a faith healer livin\u0027 in here somewhere. Called the Bright Girl. She thinks that if she finds the Bright Girl, she can get that birthmark off her.face.\" \"A faith healer? Like Oral Roberts?\" \"A little quieter, I reckon. And poorer, too. I don\u0027t believe in such things, myself.\" \"I don\u0027t either. It\u0027s a shakedown for the rubes.\" Carnival talk, he realized as soon as he\u0027d spoken. \"Arden\u0027s desperate,\" Dan said. \"She found out who I was, but she still wanted me to bring her down here. She doesn\u0027t have any money, no car, nothin\u0027. Lost her job. She\u0027s convinced herself that if she finds the Bright Girl and gets that mark off, her bad luck\u0027ll be gone, too, and her whole life\u0027ll change.\" \"To you, desperate,\" Flint said. \"To me, that\u0027s crazy.\" \"I guess people have believed stranger things.\" Flint was silent. He and Dan suddenly heard a noise like a buzz saw starting up, followed by a swarm of enraged bees trapped in a tin bucket. Pelvis was snoring. \"Yeah, I knew that was comin\u0027,\" Flint sighed. He shifted again, trying to get comfortable. The heat was squeezing sweat from his pores, and his body was exhausted, but his mind wasn\u0027t ready to shut down and let him sleep. \"Lambert, where\u0027d you think you were gonna run to?\" \"I don\u0027t know. anywhere but prison.\" \"I\u0027m surprised you got as far as you did. You\u0027ve been all over the TV and newspapers. Is that why you killed the fella at the motel? Was he about to turn you in?\" \"I told you I didn\u0027t do that. His wife did.\" \"Come on, now. You can level with me.\" \"I didn\u0027t kill him, I swear to God.\" \"Uh-hub,\" Flint said with a knowing half-smile. ,I\u0027ve heard that from a lot of guilty bastards.\" He recalled what Lambert\u0027s taste kwon do-loving ex-wife had said in the park: It was self-defense, he\u0027s not a cold-blooded killer. Another question came to him that he had to ask. \"Why didn\u0027t you shoot me? When you had my gun, and I was on the ground. Why didn\u0027t you just blow my brains out? You didn\u0027t want to kill me in front of your family, rightt\u0027 \"Wrong. I didn\u0027t want to kill you, period.\" \"You should have. If I\u0027d had the gun and you\u0027d been the bounty hunter after my ass, I would\u0027ve shot you. At least blown away your knees. Didn\u0027t you think of that?\" \"No.\" Flint turned his head to look at Dan, who had his eyes closed. Of the twenty or so felons-mostly bail @rs and small-time criminals, with a couple of real bad @ in the bunch-Flint had tracked over his seven years in the employ of Eddie Smoates, this one was different. There was [email protected] /* */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t\u003ddocument.currentScript||function(){for(t\u003ddocument.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027),e\u003dt.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\u0027data-cfhash\u0027))return t[e]}();if(t\u0026\u0026(c\u003dt.previousSibling)){p\u003dt.parentNode;if(a\u003dc.getAttribute(\u0027data-cfemail\u0027)){for(e\u003d\u0027\u0027,r\u003d\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(0,2)|0,n\u003d2;a.length-n;n+\u003d2)e+\u003d\u0027%\u0027+(\u00270\u0027+(\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* */ about Lambert he couldn\u0027t decipher, and this fact greatly agitated him. If Lambert had just finished killing the man at the motel before he\u0027d come to Basile Pgxk-if he was a \"mad dog,\" as Smoates had said-then he would have had nothing to lose by putting a couple of bullets through Flint\u0027s knees, which was the fastest way to keep anybody from chasing after you. And why hadn\u0027t Lambert kept the gun? Why had he been carrying no weapons at all? Why had he brought the girl with him and not planned to use her as a hostage? It just didn\u0027t make sense. It was self-defense, he\u0027s not a cold-blooded killer. Cold-blooded or not, Flint thought, Lambert was a killer. Maybe Lambert had just snapped or something. Maybe he hadn\u0027t gone into that bank wanting to kill anybody, but the fact was that Lambert was worth fifteen thousand dollars and Flint wanted his share of it. Bottom line. He listened to Lambert\u0027s deep and steady breathing. He thought the man was asleep, but he was going to keep the gun in his hand all night. Though Lambert couldn\u0027t get out of that cuff, he might go crazy, try to drag the cot across the space between them and attack Flint. It had happened before. You never knew what set killers off, and the quiet ones were the most dangerous. Flint closed his eyes. In the other room, Pelvis\u0027s snoring had taken on the sonic charm of a cement mixer, and now Mama gave a little yip yip yip in her sleep. It was going to be pure pleasure to say good riddance to those two. He needed a fat hillbilly and a flea-bitten mutt hanging around him like he needed a fourth arm. He thought of Pelvis\u0027s performance, which had been okay if you liked that kind of low-down caterwauling. He thought of the bartender saying Hell, I\u0027ll be his manager, then! Get out of this damn swamp and get rich, I won\u0027t never look back. And then he knew he must be asleep, because he was looking at the clean white mansion of his dreams. There it was: the beautiful rolling green lawn, the huge [email protected] window, the multiple chimneys. The sight of it thrilled his soul with majestic wonder. It was the mansion of his birth, the clean white mansion that existed somewhere in this land far from the dismal grime of his life. Hebegan to walk across the lawn toward it, but as always he couldn\u0027t get any nearer. It always drew away from him no matter how fast or how long he walked. He could hear his shoes-his shining, polished black wingtips-pressing down the velvet blades of grass. He could feel the summer breeze on his face, and see his shadow walking ahead of him. He would have to walk faster. But again the white mansion receded, a beautiful taunt. Inside that mansion lived his mother and father, and if he could only get there, he could ask them to take him in, he could tell them he forgave them for giving him up when he was a three-armed . baby with a fleshy knot on his side that had an extra mouth and set of nostrils in it. He could show them he\u0027d grown up to be a man of taste, of manners and good breeding, and he could tell them he loved them and if they took him in he would promise-he would swear to God-that he would never cause them reason to be ashameBAM! The explosion blasted Flint out of his dream. As the mansion was swept away in a heartbeat, he sat up with a jolt, his eyes bleary and the derringer held in a white-knuckled grip. His first thought was that Lambert had gone crazy and was trying to ding the cot over to W at him with his free hand. Dan was sitting up, too, his mind still shocked by the noise that had shattered his deep and dreamless sleep. The handcuff was cutting into his right wrist. He and Flint looked at each other, both of them dazed. Mama had started barking, and Pelvis was making-a sputtering noise as he struggled back to the land of the living. Suddenly someone came into the room. \"They\u0027re in here! Got a gun!\" a man shoutecl A figure lunged at Flint. He had no time to think to fire; his arm was seized, a hard blow hit him on the shoulder, and he cried out as pain streaked down to the tips of his fingers. The derringer was ripped from his hand, and a wiry arm went around his throat. He started thrashing, but the arm squeezed his larynx and took the fight out of him. Another man entered the room-a man in a dirty yellow shirt and blue jeans-and he said, \"That\u0027s the bastard shot Virgil. Hey, Doc! In here he i:o.\" Al the mention of those names Flint felt panic clutch his heart. Doc walked in. Sauntered, actually. He was still wearing his Harvard T-shirt, but he had on chinos with patched knees. His round-lensed sunglasses had been exchanged for glasses with clear lenses. Doc grinned, showing his greenish teeth. His long gray-blond hair was pulled back into a [email protected] /* */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t\u003ddocument.currentScript||function(){for(t\u003ddocument.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027),e\u003dt.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\u0027data-cfhash\u0027))return t[e]}();if(t\u0026\u0026(c\u003dt.previousSibling)){p\u003dt.parentNode;if(a\u003dc.getAttribute(\u0027data-cfemail\u0027)){for(e\u003d\u0027\u0027,r\u003d\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(0,2)|0,n\u003d2;a.length-n;n+\u003d2)e+\u003d\u0027%\u0027+(\u00270\u0027+(\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* */ and with a rubber band. \"Gomer says hey,\" he said. \"You men motherfucker, you.\" He reached out and clamped a hand onto Flint\u0027s chin. \"Now, you didn\u0027t think we were gonna let you hit and run, did you?\" Flint didn\u0027t answer, he couldn\u0027t, because his lips were crushed together. Doc\u0027s head swiveled. still grinning widely, he looked at Dan and his gaze found the handcuff. \u0027-Well, what\u0027s this all about now, huh? Who\u0027re you, friend?\" \"Dan Lambert.\" The haze of weariness hadn\u0027t quite cleared yet; everything was still weirdly dreamlike. \"I\u0027m Doc- Pleased to meet ya. Monty, bring ol\u0027 Elvis in here with us!\" In another few seconds Pelvis was hurled through the doorway and he slammed down to the floor on his hands and knees. Behind him entered a heavyset man with narrowly slit eyes, crew-cut hair, and a bristly brown beard and mustache. The man was holding a snarling and [email protected] Mama by the scruff of her neck. \"Look what i got me! he announced. \"Please...\" Pelvis\u0027s face was stricken with terror, his eyes swollen. \"Please, that\u0027s my dog,\" \"No it ain\u0027t,\" Monty said. \"It\u0027s mine. \"He ain\u0027t had a dog since @ week, when he got hungry after midnight.\" Doc put a combat-booted foot on one of Pelvis\u0027s shoulders. \"Down, boy!\" he said, and he shoved Pelvis flat to the floor. \"MY ... throat,\" Flint gasped at the man who had an arm pressed into his larynx. \"You\u0027re ... crushin, my throat.\" \"Awwwwww, Our man Flint can\u0027t hardly talid Ain\u0027t that a bitch?\" Doc shook his head with mock pity. \"Best ease up on @.\" The arm loosened. \"We wouldn\u0027t want to hurt either one of you fine fdw,\" Doc went on. \"Not till we ga a chance to @oo on your balls, I mean. Then we\u0027ll get down to some hurtin\u0027.\" \"What\u0027s goin\u0027 on?\" Dan said. \"Who are your, \"I\u0027m me. Who are you?\" \"I told you. My name\u0027s-\" \"No.\" Doc put a forefinger against Dan\u0027s mouth. \"Who are you, as in why are you wearin\u0027 a handcuff?\" \"Listen,\" Flint said, and he heard his voice tremble. \"Listen, all right?\" Doc bent toward him and cupped his hands behind his ears. \"There\u0027s been a mistake,\" Flint said. \"Mistake, he says,\" Doc relayed to the others. \"Fuckin\u0027 big mistake\" the man in the yellow shirt said. \"You shot a friend of ours. Crippled him. Ain\u0027t no good for nothin\u0027 now.\" \"Shhhhhh,\" Doc whispered. \"Let the man weave his noose, Mitch.\" If there was ever a time for the truth, this was it. Pinpricks of sweat glistened on Flint\u0027s face. He said, \"I\u0027m a bounty hunter. Workin\u0027 out of Shreveport. Both of us are.\" He nodded toward Pelvis. \"The man in handcuff is a wanted killer. Fifteen-thousand-dollar bounty on his head. We followed him down here, and we\u0027re takin\u0027 him back.\" \"Oh, first you\u0027re an astronaut, now you\u0027re Mr. WantedDead-or-Alive.\" Doc looked at Dan. \"That the truth?\" Dan nodded. \"I can\u0027t hearrrrrr youuuuuu!\" \"It\u0027s true.\" Dan realized this man was two bricks shy of a load, but what had really set off his alarms was the fact that he\u0027d seen a .45 automatic pushed down into the waistband of the man\u0027s chinos at the small of his back The big bearded bastard named Monty had a holster on his hip with a pearl-handled .38 in it, and the man who gripped Flint\u0027s throat wore an honest-to-God Ingrain submachine gun on a strap around his left shoulder, the derringer he\u0027d wrenched away from Flint now held in his right hand. \"You killed somebody?\" Doc\u0027s eyebrows went up. \"Two men,\" Flint answered. \"When we were at the marina ... I was callin\u0027 the man I work for. In Shreveport. to let him know where we were.\" \"Where you were,\" Doc said quietly, \"was on our territory.\" Pelvis had gotten up on his hands and knees once more, his eyes turned tearfully toward the man who held Mama. \"Get down, I said!\" Doc\u0027s punt cheeks burned red, and he jammed Pelvis to the floor with a boot again. \"You stay down until I say you can move! Where\u0027s that fuckin\u0027 spray you shot me with, now, huh? I\u0027ll ram my fist up your fat ass and jerk your pts out, hear me? Hear me?\" \"Ye-yes sir.\" Pelvis\u0027s body was starting to shake. \"Where you were,\" Doc repeated, speaking to Flint in a voice that was eerily calm after his outburst, \"Was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Okay, I admit it! I [email protected] up! Okay? I thought you might\u0027ve been somebody else. But when this bastard down here hurt me, and you crippled one of my friends, you crossed the line with me. I can\u0027t let that pass.\" He shagged. \"It\u0027s a hormone thing.\" \"I thought you were tryin\u0027 to kill me!\" Flint said. \"What was I supposed to do?\" \"You were supposed to take what we gave you, @tYAnyhow, if you\u0027d told us who you really were instead of pullin\u0027 that smart-ass bullshit, you wouldn\u0027t be hip-deep in hell, now, would you?\" He held his palm out and wriggled his fingers. \"The key.\" \"What key?\" \"To the cuffs. Come on, give it up.\" Flint hesitated. Doc smoothly pulled the automatic from Ins waistband, clicked the safety off, and pressed the barrel against Flint\u0027s forehead. On the floor Pelvis gave a muffled groan. \"Give it up easy,\" Doc said, his eyes icy behind the glasses, \"or I\u0027ll take it the hard way. Your choice.\" Flint reached into his pocket-\"Slowwwwwwly,\" Doc warned-and he put the key in the man\u0027s palm. Doc took two backward MM, turned toward Dan, and slid the key into the cuffs lock. He twisted it and Dan heard the mechanism click open. \"Fly free, brother,\" Doc said. Dan unlatched the cuff from his wrist. Flint\u0027s face had become a blooded study in anguish. \"Listen ... please ... he\u0027s worth fifteen thousand dollars.\" \"Not to me, he\u0027s not. Not to any of us.\" Doc opened the other cuff and gave them and the key to hitch. \"See, man, we\u0027ve all been there. There and back, on the long and twisty road. We don\u0027t give a shit for policemen, or jails. Least of all for bounty hunters. On your feet.\" The man behind Flint hauled him off the cot. Again Doc placed the automatic\u0027s. barrel to his forehead. \"Mitch, shake him down.\" \"Wearin\u0027 an empty holster under his right arm,\" Mitch said as he frisked Flint. \"And he\u0027s got something\u0027 - . . holy Jesse!\" Mitch jumped aside as if his hands had been scorched, his eyes wide with shock. \"It moved!\" He fumbled under his shirt and pulled out a blue-steel revolver. \"It moved? What moved?\" Doc tore the front of Flint\u0027s suit jacket open. And they all saw it: a serpentine shape twisting and writhin beneath Flint\u0027s shirt. Doc reached toward him, meaning to rip the shirt open, but before he could do it, Clint pushed free: first the small fingers and hand, followed by the slim, milky-white and hairless arm. Doc stood very, very still. Everyone in the room was very, very still. Dan was starting to wonder what might\u0027ve been in that gumbo he\u0027d eaten. Clint\u0027s hand clenched at the air. Flint knew what would happen next; his shirt would be torn right off his back. To prevent that indignity, he undid the rest of the buttons and opened his shirt for them all to have a good look, his face tightening with rage because their eyes had taken on that old familiar glint of ravening fascination he\u0027d suffered so many times before. \"Goddamn!\" Doc whispered. \"He\u0027s a fuckin\u0027 freak!\" \"My brother Clint.\" Flint\u0027s voice was toneless, dead. \"Born this way. Here\u0027s his head. See?\" He drew his shirt wider to show them the \u0027 fist-size lump of Clint\u0027s eyeless face at his side. \"I used to work the carnival circuit. Alive, alive, alive,\" Flint said, and a dark and terrible grin split his mouth. \"Ain\u0027t never seen nothin\u0027 like that before,\" Monty observed. He still held Mama-who\u0027d given up on her snarling but was still kicking to get loose-by the scruff of the neck. \u0027@n a girl with three tits before, but nothin\u0027 like that.\" ain\u0027t real!\" The man who\u0027d gripped Flint\u0027s throat and taken away the derringer had backed halfway across the room. \"It\u0027s a trick!\" \"You touch it and find out!\" Mitch snapped. Doc pushed Clint\u0027s hand with the automatic\u0027s barrel as Flint\u0027s insides trembled. Suddenly Clint\u0027s fingers closed around the barrel, and Doc gave a quiet laugh. \"Farrrr out!\" He carefully worked the pistol\u0027s barrel free. \"He\u0027d like to see this, wouldn\u0027t he? He\u0027d get a rush out of it.\" \"Damn straight, he would,\" Monty agreed. \"He\u0027d laugh his ass off.\" Doc finished the job of frisking Flint, then-satisfied the bounty hunter had no other weapons-he spun the .45 around a finger and pushed it back into his waistband. \"Get up, Elvis. We\u0027re goin\u0027 for a boat ride. Mitch, cuff \u0027em together.\" \"Not me! I ain\u0027t touchin\u0027 that bastard!\" \"You pussy.\" Doc took the handcuffs and snapped Pelvis\u0027s left wrist to Flint\u0027s right. The key went into a pocket of his chinos. \"Where are you takin\u0027 \u0027em?\" Dan asked, standing up from the cot. \"Brother Dan, you really don\u0027t want to know. Just call this a gift and let it go at that. Now, if I were in your shoes- He glanced down at them. \"I\u0027d steal some new ones. Those are about shot, kemo sabe. But if I were you, I wouldn\u0027t stick too long \u0027round here. Wouldn\u0027t be prudent.\" \"Can I have my dog, please?\" Pelvis sounded close to sobbing. \"Please, can I have her back?\" \"I told you, it\u0027s my dog now!\" Monty rumbled. He held Mama up and shook her. \"Have it with some bacon and eggs come daylight.\" One second Pelvis was a begging sack of sad flesh; the next second he was a juggernaut, leaping forward, his teeth gritted in a snarl, his unchained hand straining for Monty\u0027s throat. Monty jerked Mama out of Pelvis\u0027s reach and hit him, hard and fast, with a scarred fist right in the mouth. Pelvis\u0027s head snapped back, his knees giving way, and as he fell he almost dragged Flint down with him. Mitch was laughing a high-pitched giggle, Mama was snarling again, and Doc said, \"Get up, Elvis!\" He grabbed a handful of pompadour, pulled, and wound up with a wig daioing from his fingers. \"Shit!\" he laughed. \"This fucker\u0027s comin\u0027 apart!\" Pelvis was down on his knees, his head bent forward, and drops of blood were dripping on the planks. His back heaved, and now it was Dan\u0027s turn to be speared with anguish. He didn\u0027t know what to do; he didn\u0027t know if there was anything he could do. Flint shot a glare at Dan that said Look what you got us into and then he bent beside Pelvis and said, \"Hang on. Just halag on. \"Stand him up, bounty hunter.\" Doc planted the wig backward on Pelvis\u0027s naked pate. \"Let\u0027s go!\" \"Why don\u0027t you leave him alone? He\u0027s not right in the head, can\u0027t you see that7\" \"Ain\u0027t right in the teeth, ya mean,\" Monty said, and he grunted a laugh. It was all Flint could do not to go for the bastard\u0027s throat himself, but he knew it would do no good. \"Come on, stand up,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll help you.\" He had to struggle with Pelvis\u0027s weight, but then Pelvis was standing on his own. Flint didn\u0027t want to look at the man\u0027s face. Some of the blood had dripped onto Clint\u0027s fingers and Flint\u0027s shirt. \"Out,\" Doc told them, and Monty gave them a shove toward the back door he\u0027d kicked down. Dan stood, watching them go, the wheels spinning and smoking in his brain. Doc lingered behind the others. \"Either of those men you killed a cop?\" he asked. It made no sense at this precarious point to tell Doc he\u0027d killed only one man, and that by sheer bad luck. \"No.\" \"Next time try for a cop.\" Doc walked out of the cabin into the dark, whistling a happy tune. And Dan stood alone. Crossbones A pounding noise brought Arden up from the slow current of sleep. She looked out the window. Still dark. What was that noise? Louder, more insistent than the machinery. It took her another few seconds, her head still cloudy, to realize somebody was at the front door. \"Arden! Open up! It\u0027s me!\" Dan\u0027s voice. She stood up-slowly, a struggle against stiff muscles. When she was on her feet, she had to pause as dizziness made the room spin around her. \"Wait!\" she called. She limped to the door, then she had to use those same stiff muscles to push the sofa aside. Finally the latch was undone and Dan came in. His face glistened with sweat, his eyes wild. \"What is it?\" she asked. \"I thought the bounty hunters had you-\" \"They\u0027re gone. Somebody came and took \u0027em away.\" \"Took \u0027em away? Where to?\" \"I don\u0027t know. Takin\"em by boat somewhere. Four men. I haven\u0027t seen so much firepower since \u0027Nam.\" \"What?\" \"The four men. I thought they were gonna shoot \u0027em right there, but then they saw Murtaugh\u0027s arm ... I mean, his brother\u0027s arm.\" \"What are you talkin\u0027 about?\" He knew he was sounding as crazy as a broken shutter in a windstorm. He had to calm down, take some deep breaths. He pressed his fingertips against his temples. \"Four men broke into our cabin and took \u0027em away. To where, I don\u0027t know, but the one who was the boss said something\u0027 about a boat ride. They were all packin\u0027 guns.\" He started to tell her about Murtaugh\u0027s little secret, but he decided she wasn\u0027t ready for that yet. \"They didn\u0027t want me, but they sure as hell marched Murtaugh and Eisley out of there.\" He looked at his watch. Five-thirteen. \"Come on, we\u0027ve gotta tell somebody about this!\" \"Wait a minute,\" she said. \"Just a minute.\" She squeezed her eyes shut and then opened them again, trying to clear some of the cobwebs. Dan saw that sleep had lightened her eyes and that the birthmark had changed color @ like the rough skin of a chameleon, to a deep blue-tinged purple. \"The bounty hunters are gone, rightt\u0027 4-Right.\" \"Then . . . that means you\u0027re free, doesn\u0027t it?\" She ran a hand through the unruly waves of her hair. Her fingers found the painful, blood-crusted knot where her head hill been banged in the car. \"They tried to break your neck, and mine, too.
