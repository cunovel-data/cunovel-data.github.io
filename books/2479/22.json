He kept the gun\u0027s barrel jammed into Lambert\u0027s ribs. \"Well, you ran me a good chase, I\u0027ll give you that.\"\n Dan didn\u0027t answer. His heart had stopped pounding, and now there was ice in his blood. He was looking at a closed door about ten feet away. Maybe beyond it was a bathroom with a window, and if he could get in there and lock the door to buy himself a few seconds, he might still get away.\n \"Face the bar and put your hands flat on top of it.\"\n Dan obeyed, but his attention was still fixed on the door.\n If he could get out a window into the swamp, then he could ...\n Could what?he asked himself He was dead tired, hungry, and thirsty. His strength was gone. He doubted if he\u0027d had the energy to trade a punch or two with Cal, much less swim through \u0027ptor-infested water. As Flint quickly frisked him, wanting to attract as little notice as possible and helped in this regard by the loud and raucous attention being thrown at Pelvis, Dan realized that cold reality had just slapped him across the face.

As the last notes were dying, another thunderous noise rose up: the whooping and applause of his audience. Pelvis blinked out at them, stunned by the response. Though he used to play piano in a blues band when he was a lanky boy with a heedful of wavy hair and big ideas, he was accustomed to standing behind an electric guitar, which he couldn\u0027t play very well but after all it was the King\u0027s instrument. He was used to hearing club managers telling him he needed to rein his voice in and keep it snarly because those high tenor notes didn\u0027t sound like Elvis at all, that\u0027s what the customers were paying for, and if he wanted to be a decent Elvis impersonator, he was way off the mark.\n Here, though, it was obvious they were starved for entertainment and they didn\u0027t care that he wasn\u0027t twanging an electric guitar or that his voice wasn\u0027t as earthy as the King\u0027s.

Anyway, if Smoates hadn\u0027t weighed him down with Eisley, he would have finished this thing yesterday. So to hell with him.\n Flint said, \"No, I don\u0027t need to call anybody. But what are we supposed to do? Stay here until the boat comes?\" He didn\u0027t know if he could stand smelling his own body odor that long, and Lambert wasn\u0027t a sweet peach either. \"Isn\u0027t there someplace I can get a shower and some sleep?\"\n \"Well, this ain\u0027t exactly a tropical resort.\" Burt\u0027s cigar stub had gone cold, but he still kept it gripped between his teeth. Now he took it out and looked at the ashy tip, trying to decide if it was worth another match. \"You talkin\u0027 about one place for all of you? Or you want something\u0027 separate for the lady?\"\n \"I\u0027m not sleepin\u0027 in a room with them!\" Arden was still dazed and heartsick by what she\u0027d heard about the Bright Girl. In her arms the little bulldog longingly watched Pelvis.\n \"I\u0027d rather sit in here all night!\"\n . \"How much money you got?\" Burt asked Flint, and raised his eyebrows.\n \"Not much.\"\n \"You got a hundred dollars?\"\n \"Maybe.\"\n \"Okay, here\u0027s the deal,\" Burt said. \"The big boys-the execs-keep a couple of cabins to stay in when they come visit down here. They don\u0027t want to get dirty stayin\u0027 in the barracks with the workin\u0027 crews, see. I know who can pick the locks. Fifty dollars apiece, you can have \u0027em for the night. They ain\u0027t much, but they\u0027ve got clean cots and they\u0027re private.\"\n \"There\u0027s fifty dollars in my wallet,\" Dan offered. Sleep on a cot-clean or dirty, he didn\u0027t care-sounded fine to him.\n It occurred to him that this was the last night he\u0027d sleep without bars next to his mattress. \"I\u0027ll pay for her cabin.\"\n \"Yeah, it\u0027s a deal.\" Flint brought out Dan\u0027s wallet and his own and paid the money.\n \"Fine. Wait a minute, lemme listen to this here song,\" Pelvis had started a slow country-western teaderker called \"Anything That\u0027s Part of You.\" His audience sat in rapt, respectful silence as the broody piano chords thumped and, Pelvis\u0027s voice soared up in a lament that was painful enough to wet the eyes of hardcase roughnecks and bayou trash prostitutes. \"I swear,\" Burt said, \"that fella don\u0027t need to try to be Elvis. You his manager?\" He looked at Flint.\n .\u0027No. \"\n \"HelL I\u0027ll be his mqnager, then. Get out of this damn swamp and get rich, I won\u0027t never look back.\"\n \"Arden?\" Dan had seen the corners of her mouth quivering, her eyes glassy with shock. It was going to be tough on her, he knew. She\u0027d put so much blind faith into finding the Bright Girl, she\u0027d sacrificed everything, and now it was over.\n \"You all right?\"\n She didn\u0027t answer. She couldn\u0027t.\n Shadow \"You mind ?\" he asked Flint, and the bounty hunter obvious distress and moved from between Dan stood close to her. His heart ached for her, and he to put his arm around her shoulders but he didn\u0027t what comfort he could give. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said. \"I wish could\u0027ve found what you wanted.\"\n \"I-I can\u0027t belie she\u0027s dead. I just can\u0027t.\" Her eyes suddenly glistened just as quickly she blinked them away. The hi her chin. \"I can\u0027t believe it.\n Jupiter wouldn\u0027t h wrong. \"\n \"Listen to me,\" Dan said firmly. \"Startin\u0027 from this minute, here and now, you\u0027re gonna have to go back to reality. That means back to Fort Worth and getting\u0027 on with your life. However bad things look, they\u0027ve got to get better.\" \"I don\u0027t think so\u0027 \"You don\u0027t know what tomorro\u0027s gonna bring. Or next week, or next month. You\u0027ve gotta go day by day, and that\u0027s how you get through the rough spots. Beheve me, I\u0027ve been \u0027there.\"\n Arden nodded, but the Bright Girl was a candle she could not bear to extinguish. It struck her how selfish she\u0027d been, consumed by her own wishes. From the moment the man in the dark suit had set foot into this cafe, Dan had been on his way to prison. \"Are you all right?\"\n she asked.\n \"I beheve I am.\" He offered her a faint, brave smile when inside he felt as if he\u0027d been hit by a tractor-trailer truck \"Yeah, I\u0027m all right. This was gonna happen sooner or later.\" His smile faded. \"I saw my son, I said what I needed to say without bars between us.\n That\u0027s the important thing.\"\n He shrugged. \"At least where I\u0027m goin\u0027 I\u0027ll have a roof over my head and hot food.\u0027 Won\u0027t be much worse than the V.A.\n hospital, I guess. Anyhow-\" His voice cracked, and he had to pause to summon the strength to continue. \"Like I said, you go day by day. That\u0027s how you get through the rough spots.\"\n \"Miss?\" Burt put his elbows on the bar and leaned toward her.\n Pelvis had finished the slow, sad number and was getting up from the piano to take his bows, sweat dripping from schins.\"Iknowwhocouldtellyouiftherewasever anybody livin\u0027 on Goat Island or not. Cajun fella they call Little Tmin. He was born \u0027round here. Sometimes he takes the execs huntin\u0027 and fishin\u0027. Sells us fish and game for the cafe, too, so he gets all \u0027round the swamp.\n If anybody would know, it\u0027d be him.\"\n \"Arden?\" Dan\u0027s voice was quiet. \"Give it up. Please.\"\n She wanted to. She really did. But she was desperate and afraid.\n This would be her @ chance, and she would never come this way again.\n Even finding the Bright Girl\u0027s grave would be an answer, though not the one she wished for. She said, \"Where is he?\"\n \"Lives on a houseboat, anchored \u0027bout a mile south of here. Keeps to himself, mostly.\" He stared at her birthmark, his gaze following its ragged edges. \"I\u0027ve got a motorboat, and I\u0027m off shift at six A.M.\n I need to run down there to see him anyhow, put in an order for some catfish and turtle meat. If you want to go, you\u0027re welcome. And I can carry two people, if you want to go along.\" He was speaking to Dan.\n Dan saw the need in Arden\u0027s eyes; it was a painful thing to witness, because he knew she stood at the very edge of sanity. He had to turn away from her, and when he heard her say \"I\u0027ll go alone,\" it was clear to him that she\u0027d placed one foot over the precipice.\n \"Okay, then. Whatever suits you. Hey, fella!\" He grinned at Pelvis, who was making his way to the bar through a knot of backslappers. \"You \u0027bout knocked hell outta that piano, didn\u0027t you?\"\n Pelvis said, \"Thank you, ma\u0027am\" as he took Mama back into his arms, and Mama trembled with love and attacked his face with her tongue. He was breathing hard, and he felt a little dizzy, but otherwise he was okay. Sweat was pouring off him in rivers. \"Can I have some water, please?\"\n \"Comin\u0027 right up!\"\n \"Mr. Murtaugh?\" Pelvis smiled broadly. \"I think they like me.\"\n \"You were all right. If you care for that kind of music.\n Here, wipe your face.\" He pulled a handftd of paper napkins out 0 were hoflerin\u0027?\"\n \"Uh-huh. Well, step down offyour pedestal and listen: we can\u0027t get out of here till tomorrow afternoon. We have to wait for a supply boat from Grand -Isle. How the hell we\u0027re supposed to get back to the car I don\u0027t know, but that\u0027s how things are. ti \"At least we got [email protected] didn\u0027t we?\" Pelvis nodded toward Dan, who\u0027d gone back to eating his gumbo.\n We, my ass, Flint was about to say, but Burt stuck his bearded face over the bar again. \"You play betteen you look, if you don\u0027t mind me sayin\u0027.\"\n I.Sir?ll \"You know. The Elvis thing, with the judo moves and all.\n That\u0027s what I expected.\"\n \"Well, all them songs I sang were ones Elvis done,\" Pelvis explained. \"And I do them moves in my show, but I couldn\u0027t cause I was sittin\u0027at the piano. Like I said, I usually play the git-tar.\"\n \"You want my advice? I\u0027m gonna give it to you anyway.\n Don\u0027t hide behind Elvis. You don\u0027t need it, a fella can pound them @ and sing like, you do. Hell, you oughta go to Nashville and show \u0027em what you can do.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gone-south/page-22.html","bookId":2479,"book":{"id":2479,"title":"Gone South","description":"Storyline: \n Flooded by memories, poisoned by Agent Orange, Dan Lambert kills a man in a moment of fear and fury -- and changes his life forever.
