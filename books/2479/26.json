He saw her when he was a little boy, and he told me all about her.\"\n \"Oh, them stories. That she\u0027s a young beautimous girl and she don\u0027t never get old or die. That she can touch you and heal any sickness, or cancer ... or scar. Your friend tell you all that?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"So you believe mighty hard, and you come all the way down here to ask her touch. \u0027cause that mark, it hurt you inside?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n Train reached toward her face. Arden\u0027s first impulse was to Pull away, but his gaze was powerful enough to hold her.\n His rough brown fingers gently @ the birthmark d th,e,n, drew back- \"YOU strong-hearted?\" he asked.\n ... think I am. \"Either am or not.tt \"I am,\" she said.\n Train nodded. \"Then I take you, no sweat.\"\n Dan couldnt re ai il an ll to re m n sent any longer. \"Don\u0027t e h .\n e \u0027s nO such Person!

Train\u0027s voice was calm. \"I say, too, the Bright Girl ain\u0027t who she come to find.\"\n f-l \u0027What?\" Arden shook her head. \"I\u0027m not followin, you.\n \"When we get there, you see tings clear. Then we find out how strong you heart.\n Dan didn\u0027t know what to say, or what kind of tricks this man was trying to Pull. None of it made any sense to him.\n What had to gnaw at him again was the fate of Murlaugh and Eisley. He couldn\u0027t stand the thought that his Pulling the trigger in Shreveport had resulted in the death of Harmon DeCayne and now, most likely, the two bounty hunters. There would be four murders on his head, and how could he live with that and not go insane? He remembered what Burt had said about Train, back in the cafe: He ets \" , 9 a round the swamp. If anybody would know, itd be him. .\"men Dan had to asil were two other men with us. We were at St- Nasty. Around five o\u0027clock, four men with gain broke in Our cabin and took \u0027em away. The one in charge was called Doc. Do you know- \"Oh, shit!\" Burt put his hands to his ears. \"I dont wanna hear this! I don\u0027t wanna know nothin\u0027 about it!\"\n \"Hush up!\" Train\u0027s voice rattled the screens. \"Let \u0027im talk!\"\n \"I\u0027m not stayin\u0027 around for this! No way! Ya\u0027ll have fun, I\u0027m getting\u0027 back up the bayou!\" Burt started out but paused at the door.\n \"Train, don\u0027t do nothin\u0027 stupid! Hear me? I\u0027ll be expectin\u0027 the cat and turtle by Tbesday. Hear?\"\n \"Go home, bon ami, \" Train said. \"And to you safe passage.\"\n \"Good luck,\" Burt told Dan, and he went out and crossed the gangplank. Train walked past Arden to a window and watched Burt untie his boat, climb in, and start the engine.\n \"He\u0027s okay,\" Train said as Burt steered the motor skiff back up the narrow bayou the way they\u0027d come. \"Hard-workin\u0027 fella.\"\n \"He knows who Doc is, doesn\u0027t he?\"\n \"Oh, oui. And so do I.\" He turned away from the window; his face seemed to have drawn tighter across the bones, his eyes cold. \"Tell me the tale, ay?\"\n Dan told him, omitting the fact that he was wanted for murder and that Murtaugh and Eisley were bounty hunters.\n He omitted, as well, the fact of Murtaugh\u0027s freak-show background.\n \"Doc said he was takin\u0027 \u0027em somewhere by boat. He had some kinda score to settle with \u0027em, but I\u0027m not sure what it was.\"\n Train leveled that hard, penetrating stare at Dan.\n \"Friends of you, they is?\"\n \"Not friends, exactly.\"\n \"Then who they is to you?\"\n \"More like. . . fellow travelers.\"\n \"Where was they travelin\u0027 to?\"\n Dan looked at the elephants and tigers in the rug. He could feel Train watching him, and he knew there was no use in lying. Train was no fool. He sighed heavily; the only path to take was the straight one. \"Flint Murtaugh and Pelvis Eisley are their names. They\u0027re bounty hunters. They tracked me down here. I met Arden in a truck stop north of Lafayette and brought her with me.\"\n \"I came because I wanted to,\" Arden said. \"He didn\u0027t force me.\"\n \"Bounty hunterr\" Tn\" repeated. \"What crime you did?\"\n \"I killed a man. Train didn\u0027t move or \"He worked at a bank in Shreveport. There was a fight. I lost my head and shot him. The bank\u0027s put fifteen thousand dollars reward on [email protected] Murtaugh and Eisley wanted it.\" \"Huuuuwheeee,\" Tn\" said sol\u0027dy.\n \"You can have the reward, I won\u0027t give you any trouble.\n Can You call the law or somebody on that shortwave @, \"I ready tell you, I don\u0027t need no money.

He frowned, the @es deepening around his eyes, and he mbbed hir, silvered chin. \"If them bounty hunters after you, how come for you wanna heP \u0027em? HOw come you even tellm\u0027 me this?\"\n \"They dont deserve to be murdered, that\u0027s why! They haven\u0027t done anything wrong! \"Hey, W Calm down.

I\u0027ll be there direct.\"\n \"What about the shortwave? \"Yeah, I could call the law way over to Gran, ile. Only @ is, they ain\u0027t gonna find you ... fella travelers,\" he decided to say. \"Likely they dead a\u0027ready. Now go on out and so ytsefflt There wasn\u0027t much of a breeze on the porch, but it was a little cooler there thin made the boat. Dan was too jumpy to sit, though Arden settled in a wicker chair that faced the cove. \"You\u0027re goin\u0027 with me, aren\u0027t your\u0027 she asW him \"We\u0027re so close, you\u0027ve got to go with me.\"\n \"I\u0027ll go. I UM don\u0027t believe it, but I\u0027ll go.\" He stood at the \u003dM, looking out at the water\u0027sUM surface. \"@- he said. \"There\u0027s gotta [email protected], somebody can do!\" \"Oui, YOU can take a smaller of this here.\" Train came OntO the POrch- He had uncWW a small metal @ and he offered it to Dan. \"Ain\u0027t \u0027shine,\" he said when Dan hesitated.\n \"It\u0027s French brandy. Buy it in Grand Isle. Go ahead, ay?\"\n Dan accepted the flask and took a drink. The brandy burned its flaming trail down his throat. Train offered the flask to Arden, and when she shook her head he took a sip and sloshed it around in his mouth before swallowin \"Now I gonna tell you \u0027bout them men, so listen good. They got a placebout five mile southwest from here. Hid real fine.\n I ain\u0027t got an eye set for it, but I come up on it when I\u0027m huntin\u0027boar near Lake Calliou. They been there maybe tree month. Set up camp, brung in a prefab house, build a dock, swimmin\u0027 pool, and all whatcha like. Got a shrimp boat and two of them expenseeve cigarettes.\n You know, them fast speederboats. Then they put bob wire \u0027round eveeting.\" He swigged from the flask and held it out to Dan again. \"I hear from an al\u0027 Cajun boy live on Calliou Bay them men be poachin\"ptor. Season don\u0027t start till September, see. Ain\u0027t no big ting, it happen. But I start to windin\u0027in my head, how come they to poach \u0027ptor.? Somebody owns hisse\u0027f two of them cigarettes, he got to poach \u0027ptor? Why\u0027s that so, ayT\u0027 He took the flask back after Dan had had a drink. \"Ol\u0027 boy says he seen lights at night, boats comin\u0027 and goin\u0027 all hours.\n So I go over there, hide my boat, and watch through my dark vision binocs \u0027cause I eat up with curious. Took me two night, then I see what they up to.\"\n \"What was it?\" Arden asked, pulling her thoughts away from the Bright Girl for the moment.\n \"Freighter in the bay, unloadin\u0027 what look like grain sacks to the shrimp boat. All the time the two cigarettes they circlin\u0027 and circlin\u0027 \u0027round, throwin\u0027 spotlights. Andhuuuuwheee!-the men in them boats with the like of guns you never did saw! Shrimp boat brung the @ sacks back in, freighter up anchor and went.\" He had another swig of Napoleon\u0027s finest. \"Now what kinda cargo unloaded by night and be that worth protection?\"\n \"Drugs,\" Dan said.\n \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m figurin\u0027. Either the heroin or the cockaine.\n Maybe both. All them miles and miles of swamp coast, the law cain\u0027t hardly patrol a smidgen of it, and they boats in sorry shape. So these fellas bringin\u0027 in the dope and shippin\u0027 it north, likely takin\u0027 it up by Bayou du Large or Bayou Grand Calliou and unloadin\u0027 at a marina. Sellin\u0027 some of it at St. Nasty, too. Burt\u0027s the one found out fella named Doc Nyland was hangin\"round the poolhall, givin\u0027 men free samples to get lem interested.\n Peacekeeper tried to do r-omethin\u0027 about it, he went missin\u0027. Only ting is, I cain\u0027t figure why they poachin\u0027 the lptors. Then-boom!-it hit me like a brick upside my head.\" Train capped the flask.\n \"They worry somebody gonna steal them drugs away from lem. Worry so much they gonna be hijack they gotta figure a waY to move \u0027em safe.\n So what they gonna do, ay? They gonna put them drugs somewhere they cain\u0027t be easy stole.\"\n His mouth crooked in a wicked smile. \"Like inside live ptors.\"\n \"Inside \u0027em?\"\n \"Sans doute! You wrap that cockaine up in metal foil good and tight, then you jam it down in them bellies with a stick!\n How you gonna get it out unless you got a big knife and a lotta time to be cuttin\u0027? That\u0027d be the goddangest mess you never did saw!\"\n \"I\u0027ll bet,\" Dan agreed. \"So what are they doin? Shippin\u0027 the \u0027ptors north to be cut open?\"\n \"Oui, puttin\"em on a truck and takin\"em to a safe place.\n Even if them \u0027ptors die of bad digestion \u0027fore they get where they goin\u0027, the cockaine still protected in there.\"\n Iylm so, but I can\u0027t understand how Murtaugh and Eisley got mixed up with a gang of drug runners. Is Doc Nyland their leader?\"\n Train shook his head. \"I sinn somebody else over there, look like he was bossin\u0027. Fella don\u0027t wear no shirt, showin\u0027 hisse\u0027f off.\n Standin\u0027 by the pool, them irons and weight bars layin\u0027 eveewhere. His girlfrien\u0027, all she do is lay there sunburnin\u0027. I\u0027m figurin\u0027 he\u0027s the honch.\"\n Dan looked out through the screen at the water. The sun was up strong and hot now, golden light streaming through the trees. A movement caught his attention, and he saw a moccasin undulating smoothly across the surface. He watched it until it disappeared into the shadows. It seemed to Dan that in this swamp the human reptiles were the ones to be feared most of all. He lifted his forearm and stared at his snake tattoo.\n Once, a long time ago, he had been a brave man. He had done without hesitation what he\u0027d thought was the right thing. He had walked the world like a giant himself, before time and fate had beaten him down.\n Now he was dying and he was a killer, sick at heart.\n He felt as if he were peering into a snake hole, and if he reached into it to drag the tinng out, he could be bitten to death. But if he turned his back on it like a coward, he was already dead.\n An image came to him, unbidden: Farrow\u0027s face and voice, there on that terrible night the snipers\u0027 bullets had hissed out of the jungle.\n Go, held said. It had not been a shout, but it was more powerful than a shout.\n Go.\n Dan remembered the glint of what might have been joy in Farrow\u0027s eyes as the man-a citizen of Hell, one of the walking damned-had turned and slogging back through the mud toward the jungle, firing his M 16 to give Dan and the others precious seconds in which to save their own lives.\n Farrow could not live with himself because he\u0027d gone south.

It was a strange thing, but now he could look at her face and not see the birthmark.\n \"Maybo they\u0027re still alive, but they won\u0027t be for very long.

And if I don\u0027t do something, I\u0027ll carry my own prison around with me every hour of every day I\u0027ve got left. I have to do this.

You got a holster for the pistol?\"\n \"I do.\"\n \"Then you\u0027ll take me?\"\n Train paused for a moment, thinking it over. He opened the flask again and took a long swig. \"You a mighty strange killer, wantin\u0027 to get killed for somebody tryin\u0027 to slam you in prison.\" He licked his lips. \"Huuuuwheeee! I didn\u0027t know I was gonna get dead today.\"\n \"I can go in alone.\"\n \"Well,\" Train said, \"it\u0027s like this here: I knew a fella, name of Jack Giradoux. Parish ranger, he was.

She had come so far, with so much at stake. But now she knew what the important thing was.

He found extra magazines for the rifles and clips for the automatic and put them in a faded old backpack, which Arden was given charge of. Dan took the Browning and the pistol. Train got a plastic jug of filtered water from the galley, slung the Rugees strap around his shoulder, and said, \"We go.\"\n They left the houseboat and Train led them to the vine-covered floating structure next to the pier. He slid open a door. \"Here she sets.\"\n \"Jesus,\" Dan said, stunned by what he saw.\n Sitting inside was Train\u0027s second boat. It was painted navy gray, the paint job relatively fresh except for patches of rust at the waterline. It resembled a smaller version of a commercial tug, but it was leaner and meaner, its squat pilothouse set closer to the prow.\n The craft was about fifty feet long, and thirteen feet high at its tallest point, a tight squeeze in the oil-smelling, musty boathouse.\n It had not the gentle charm of an infant, but the armor-plated threat of a brute.\n Though the machine-gun mounts and the mortar had been removed and other\u0027civilian modifications made to the radar mast, Dan recognized it as a Swift-type river patrol boat, the same kind of vessel Train had crewed aboard on the deadly waterways of Vietnam.\n \"My baby,\" Train said with a sly grin. \"Let the good times Reptilian The sun had risen on a small aluminum rowboat in the middle of a muddy pond. In that rowboat Flint and Pelvis sat facing each other, linked by the short chain between their cuffed wrists.\n At seven o\u0027clock the temperature was approaching eightyfour degrees and the air steamed with humidity. Flint\u0027s shirt and suit jacket had been stripped off him, Clint\u0027s arm drooping lethargically from the pale, sweat-sparkling chest.\n Beads of moisture glistened on Flint\u0027s hollow-eyed face, his head bowed. Across from him, Pelvis still wore his wig backward, his clothes sweat-drenched, his eyes swollen and forlorn. Dried blood covered the split sausage of his bottom lip, one of his lower teeth gone and another knocked crooked, tendrils of crusty blood stuck to his chin. His breathing was slow and harsh, sweat dripping from the end of his nose into a puddle between his mud-bleached suedes.\n Something brushed against the boat\u0027s hull and made the craft lazily turn around its anchor chain. Flint lifted his head to watch a five-foot-long alligator drift past, its snout pushing through the foul brown water. A second alligator, this one maybe three feet in length, cruised past the first.\n The cat-green eyes and ridged skull of a third had surfaced less than six feet from the rowboat. Two more, each fourtooters, lay motionless side by side just beyond the silent watcher. Flint had counted nine alligators at any one time, but there might be others asleep on the bottom. He couldn\u0027t tell one from the- other, except for their obvious size differences, so he really didn\u0027t know how many lurked in the sludgy pond. Still, they were quiet monsters. Occasionally two or three would bump together in their back-and-forth [email protected] driftings and there might be an instant\u0027s outburst of thrashing anger, but then everything would calm down again but for the rocking of the boat and the thudding hearts of the men in it. Flint figured the ariptors were prisoners here just as he and Pelvis were.\n The pond looked to be sixty-five feet across, from one side of a half-submerged, rusty barbed-wire fence to the other.\n Beyond the alligator corral\u0027s heavily bohed gate was a pier where two cigarette speedboats-both of them painted dark, nonreflective green-were Wed, along with the larger workboat Flint had seen unloading the reptiles at the Vermilion marina. Eight feet of the pier was built out over the corral, and at its end stood a bolted-down electric winch Flint figured was used to hoist the alligators up onto the workboat\u0027s deck. During the thirty-minute journey to this place in one of the speedboats, Monty had gleefully ripped the jacket and shirt off Flint\u0027s back and taken the derringer\u0027s holster. Then, when they\u0027d reached their destination, Doc and the others had debated for a few minutes, what to do with them until \"he\"-whoever \"hell waswoke up.\n Their current situation had been dreamed up by Doc, who got Mitch to row them in the aluminum skiff through the corral\u0027s gate while Monty had followed in a second rowboat. There had been much hilarity from a group of men watching on the pier as Mitch had thrown a concrete brick anchor over the side and then got into the boat with Monty, leaving Flint and Pelvis at the end of their chain.\n The party had gone on for a while-\"Hey, freak! Why don\u0027t you and Elvis get out of that boat and cool yourselves off?\"-but the men had drifted away as the sun had come up. Flint understood why; the novelty had faded, and they\u0027d known how hot it was going to get out here.\n Every so often Mitch, Monty, or some other\u0027bastard would stroll out to the pier\u0027s end to take a look and throw a remark at them that included the words \"freak\" or \"motherfuckers,\" then they would go away again.\n Since Pelvis had been smashed in the mouth, he\u0027d not spoken a single word. Flint realized he must be in shock. Monty had taken Mama with him, and the last time the bearded sonofabitch had come out to check on them, the little bulldog wasn\u0027t in his arms.\n Flint could smell meat cooking.\n Being burned was more like it.\n The pier continued on past the boats to a bizarre sight: a large suburban ranch house with cream-colored walls, perched on wooden pilings over the water. The place looked as if it had been lifted up off the\u0027mowed green lawn of the perfect American town, helicoptered in, and set down to be the envy of the neighborhood. There was a circular swimming pool with its own redwood deck, one of those \"aboveground\"\n pools sold in kits; here the pool was not above ground, but on a platform above swamp. On the pool\u0027s deck was a rack of barbells, a weight bench, and a stationary cycle. Next to it was another large deck shaded by a blue-and-white-striped canvas awning, and on the far side of the house the platform supported a television satellite dish.\n Other walkways went off from the main platform, connecting the house to three other smaller wooden structures.\n Cables snaked from one of them to the house and the satellite dish, so Flint reasoned it stored the power generator. Though the alligator corral, the pier, and the swimming pool were out under the full sun, most of the house was shaded by moss-draped trees. Around the house and the corral and everything else the swamp still held green dominion. Flint could see a bayou winding into the swamp beyond the farthermost of the three outbuildings, and there were red buoys floating in it to mark deeper passage for the workboat\u0027s hull.\n His survey of the area had also found a wooden watchtower, about forty feet high, all but hidden amid the trees at the bayou\u0027s entrance.\n Up top, under a green-painted cupola, a man sat in a lawn chair reading a magazine, a rifle propped against the railing beside him.\n Every few minutes he would stand up and scan all directions through a pair of binoculars, then he would sit down again and return to his reading.\n \"We,\" Flint said hoarsely, \"are in deep shit.\"\n Pelvis didn\u0027t speak; he just sat there and kept sweating, hir, eyes unfocused.\n \"Eisley? Snap out of it, hear me?\"\n There was no answer; A little thread of saliva had spooled down over his wounded lip.\n \"How about sayin\u0027 something\u0027?\" Flint asked.\n Pelvis lowered his head and stared at the boat\u0027s bottonl Flint sniffed the air, catching the smell of burned meat. it struck him that that bastard Monty might be hungry again, and he Pelvis was probably thinking the same thing he was: Mama was on the breakfast grill. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gone-south/page-26.html","bookId":2479,"book":{"id":2479,"title":"Gone South","description":"Storyline: \n Flooded by memories, poisoned by Agent Orange, Dan Lambert kills a man in a moment of fear and fury -- and changes his life forever.
