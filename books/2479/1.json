{"id":83636,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"It was hell\u0027s season, and the air smelled of burning children.\n This smell was what had destroyed Dan Lambert\u0027s taste for barbecued pork sandwiches. Before August of 1969, the year he\u0027d turned twenty, his favorite food had been barbecue crispy at the edges and drenched with sloppy red sauce.\n After the eleventh day of that month, the smell of it was enough to make him sick to death.\n He was driving east through Shreveport on 70th Street, into the glare of the morning sun. It glanced off the hood of his gray pickup truck and stabbed his eyes, inflaming the slow ache in his skull. He knew this pain, and its vagaries.\n Sometimes it came upon him like a brute with a hammer, sometimes like a surgeon with a precise scalpel. During the worst times it hit and ran like a Mack truck and all he could do was chew on his rage and lie there until his body came back to him.\n It was a hard thing, dying was.\n In this August of 1991, a summer that had been one of the hottest in Louisiana\u0027s long history of hellish seasons, Dan was forty-two years old. He looked ten years older, his rawboned, heavily lined face a testament to his ceaseless combat with pain. It was a fight he knew he couldn\u0027t win. if he knew for certain he would live three more years, he wasn\u0027t sure if he\u0027d be happy about it. Right now it was day-to-day.\n Some days were all right, some weren\u0027t worth a bucket of warm spit.\n But it wasn\u0027t in his nature to give up, no matter how tough things got. His father, the quitter, had not raised a quitter. In this, at least, Dan could find strength.\n He drove on along the arrow-straight line of 70th Street, past strip malls and car lots and fast-food joints. He drove on into the merciless sun and the smell of murdered innocents.\n Lining the commercial carnival of 70th Street was a score of barbecue restaurants, and it was from their kitchen chimneys that this odor of burned flesh rose into the scalded sky. It was just after nine, and already the temperature sign in front of the Friendship Bank of Louisiana read eighty-six degrees. The sky was cloudless, but was more white than blue, as if all the color had been bleached from it. The sun was a burnished ball of pewter, a promise of another day of misery across the Gulf states. Yesterday the temperature had hit a hundred and two, and Dan figured that today it was going to be hot enough to fry pigeons on the wing.\n Afternoon showers passed through every few days, but it was just enough to steam the streets. The Red River flowed its muddy course through Shreveport to the bayou country and the air shimmered over the larger buildings that stood iron-gray against the horizon.\n Dan had to stop for a red light. The pickup\u0027s brakes squealed a little, in need of new pads. A job replacing rotten lumber on a patio deck last week had made him enough to pay the month\u0027s rent and utilities, and he\u0027d had a few dollars left over for groceries. Still, some-things had to slide. He\u0027d missed two payments on the pickup, and he needed to go in and see Mr. Jarrett to work something out. Mr.\n Jarrett, the loan manager at the First Commercial Bank, understood that Dan had fallen on hard times, and cut him some slack.\n The pain was back behind his eyes. It lived there, like a hermit crab. Dan reached beside himself on the seat, picked up the white bottle of Excedrin, and popped it open. He shook two tablets onto his tongue and chewed them. The light turned green and he drove on, toward Death Valley.\n Dan wore a rust-colored short-sleeve shirt and blue jeans with patches on the knees. Under a faded blue baseball his thinning brown hair was combed back from his fore and spilled over his shoulders; haircuts were not high on his list of priorities. He had light brown eyes and a closecropped beard that was almost all gray. On his left wrist was a Timex and on his feet was a sturdy pair of brown, much-scuffed workboots. On his right forearm was the bluish-green ghost of a snake tattoo, a reminder of a burly kid who\u0027d had one too many cheap and potent zombies with his buddies on a night of leave in Saigon. That kid was long gone, and Dan was left with the tattoo. The Snake Handlers, that\u0027s what they\u0027d been. Not afraid to stick their hands in the jungle\u0027s holes and pull out whatever horror might be coiled up and waiting in there. They had not known, then, that the entire world was a snake hole, and that the snakes just kept getting bigger and meaner. They had not known, in their raucous rush toward the future, that the snakes were lying in wait not only in the holes but in the mowed green grass of the American Dream. They got your legs first, wound around your ankles, and slowed you down. They slithered into your guts and made you sick and afraid, and then you were easy to kill.\n In the years since that Day-Glo memory of a night in Saigon, Dan Lambert had shrunken. At his chest-thumping, Charlie-whomping best he\u0027d stood six-two and carried two hundred and twelve pounds of Parris Island-trained muscle. Back then, he\u0027d felt as if he could swallow bullets and shit iron. He weighed about a hundred and seventy pounds now, and he didn\u0027t think he was much over six feet. There was a gauntness in his face that made him think of some of the old Vietnamese people who\u0027d huddled in their hootches with eyes as terrified as those of mongrel dogs expecting a boot. His cheekbones jutted, his chin was as sharp as a can opener under the beard. It was the fact that he rarely ate three meals a day, and of course a lot of his shrinkage was due to the sickness, too.\n Gravity and time were the giant killers, he thought as he drove along the sun-washed highway with the back of his sweat-wet shirt stuck to the seat. Gravity shrank you and time pulled you into the grave, and not even the Snake Handlers could beat such fearsome enemies as those.\n He drove through pale smoke that had drifted from the chimney of Hungry Bob\u0027s Barbecue Shack, the cook getting all that meat good and black for the lunch crowd. A tire hit a pothole, and in the truck\u0027s bed his box of tools jangled. They were the hammers, nails, levels and saws of a carpenter.\n At the next intersection he turned right and drove south into an area of warehouses. It was a world of chainlink fences, loading docks, and brick walls. Between the buildings the heat lay trapped and vengeful. Up ahead a halfdozen pickup trucks and a few cars were parked in an empty lot. Dan could see some of the men standing around talking.\n Another man was sitting in a folding chair reading a newspaper, his CAT hat throwing a slice of shade across his face. Standing near one of the cars was a man who had a sign hanging around his neck, and on that sign was hand-lettered WILL WORK FOR FOOD.\n This was Death Valley.\n Dan pulled his truck into the lot and cut the engine. He unpeeled his damp shirt from the backrest, slipped the bottle of aspirin into his pocket, and got out. \"There\u0027s Dan the man!\" Steve Lynam called from where he stood talking with Darryl Glennon and Curtis Nowell, and Dan raised a hand in greeting.\n \"Mornin, Dan,\" Joe Yates said, laying his newspaper in his lap.\n \"How\u0027s it hangin\u0027?\"\n \"It\u0027s still there,\" Dan answered. \"I think.\"\n \"Got iced tea.\" A plastic jug and a bag of Dixie cups sat on the ground next to Joe\u0027s folding chair. \"Come on over.\"\n Dan joined him. He drew iced tea into a cup and eased himself down beside Joe\u0027s shadow. \"Terry got a ticket,\" Joe said as he offered Dan some of the newspaper. \"Fella came by \u0027bout ten minutes ago, lookin\u0027 for a man to set some Sheetrock. Picked Terry and off they went.\"\n \"That\u0027s good.\" Terry Palmeter had a wife and two kids to feed.\n \"Fella say he might be needin\u0027 some more help later on?\"\n \"Just the one Sheetrock man.\" Joe squinted up toward the sun. He was a lean, hard-faced man with a nose that had been broken and flattened by a vicious fist somewhere down the line. He\u0027d been coming here to Death Valley for over a year, about as long as Dan had been.\n On most days Joe was an amiable gent, but on others he sat brooding and darkspirited and was not to be approached. Like the other men who came to Death Valley, Joe had never revealed much about himself, though Dan had learned the man had been married and divorced the same as he had.\n Most of the men were from towns other than Shreveport. They were wanderers, following the promise of work, and for them the roads on the map led not so much from city to city as from hot-tarred roofs to mortared walls to the raw frameworks of new houses with pinewood so fresh the timbers wept yellow tears. \"God, it\u0027s gonna be a cooker today,\" Joe said, and he lowered his head and returned to his reading and waiting.\n Dan drank the iced tea and felt sweat pricker* the back of his neck. He didn\u0027t want to stare, but his eyes kept returning to the man who wore the desperate hand-lettered sign. The an had sandy-blond hair, was probably in s lite twenties, and wore a checked shirt and stained overalls. His face was @ boyish, though it was starting to take on the tautness of true hunger. It reminded Dan of someone he\u0027d known a long time ago. A name came to him: Farrow. He let it go, and the memory drifted away like the acrid barbecue smoke.\n \"Looky here, Dan.\" Joe thumped an article in the Oaper.\n \"President\u0027s economics honcho says the recession\u0027s over and everybody ought to be in fine shape by Christmas. Says new construction\u0027s already up thirty percent.\"\n \"Do tell,\" Dan said.\n \"Got all sorts of graphs in here to show how happy we oughta be.\"\n He showed them to Dan, who glanced at the meaningless bars and arrows and then watched the man with the sign again. \"Yeah, things are sure getting\u0027 better all over, ain\u0027t they.?\" Joe nodded, answering his own cynical question. \"Yessir. Too bad they forgot to tell the workman.\"\n \"Joe, who\u0027s that fella over there?\" Dan asked. \"The guy with the sign.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" He didn\u0027t lift his gaze from the paper.\n \"He was there when I got here. Young fella, looks to be. Hell, ve man jack of us would work for food if it came to that, b% e don\u0027t wear signs advertisin\u0027 it, do we?\"\n \"Maybe we\u0027re not hungry enough yet.\"\n \"Maybe not,\" Joe agreed, and then he said nothing else.\n More men were arriving in their pickups and cars, some with wives who let them out and drove off. Dan recognized others he knew, like Andy Slane and Jim Neilds. They were a community of sorts, scholars in the college of hard knocks.\n Fourteen months ago Dan had been working on the payroll of the AA Construction Company. Their motto had been We Build the Best for Less.\n Even so, the company hadn\u0027t been strong enough to survive the bottom falling out of the building business. Dan had lost his job of five years and quickly found that nobody was hiring carpenters full-time.\n The first thing to go had been his house, in favor of a cheaper apartment. His savings had dwindled amazingly-and frighteningly-fast.\n Since his divorce in 1984 he\u0027d been paying child support to Susan, so his bank account had never been well padded. But he\u0027d never been a man who needed or expected luxuries, anyway. The nicest thing in his possession was his Chevy pickup-\"metallic mist\" was the correct name of its color, according to the salesman-which he\u0027d bought three months prior to the crash of AA Construction. Being behind the two payments bothered him; Mr. Jarrett was a fair man, and Dan was not one to take advantage of fairness. He was going to have to find a way to scrape some cash together.\n He didn\u0027t like looking at the man who wore the handlettered sign, but he couldn\u0027t help it. He knew what trying to find a steady job was like. With all the layoffs and businesses going under, the help-wanted ads had dried up to nothing.\n Skilled laborers like Dan and the others who came to Death Valley were the first to feel the hurt. He didn\u0027t like looking at the man with the desperate sign because he feared he might be seeing his own future.\n Death Valley was where men who wanted to work came to wait for a \"ticket.\" Getting a ticket meant being picked for a job by anyone who needed labor. The contractors who were still in business knew about Death Valley, and would go there to find help when a regular crewman was sick or they needed extra hands for a day or two. Regular homeowners sometimes drove by as well, to hire somebody to do such jobs as patching a roof or building a fence. The citizens of Death Valley worked cheap.\n And the hell of it, Dan had learned by talking to the others, was that places like Death Valley existed in every city. It had become clear to him that thousands of men and women lived clinging to the edge of poverty through no fawt of their own but because of the times and the luck of the draw. The recession had been a beast with a cold eye, and it had wrenched families young and old from their homes and shattered their lives with equal dispassion.\n \"Hey, Dan! How many\u0027d ya kill?\"\n Two shadows had fallen across him. He looked up and made out Steve Lynam and Curtis Nowell standing beside him with the sun at their backs. \"What?\" he asked.\n \"How many\u0027d ya kill?\" Curtis had posed the question.\n He was in his early thirties, had curly dark brown hair, and wore a yellow T-shirt with no stenciled on it. \"How many chinks? More than twenty or less than twenty?\"\n \"Chinks?\" Dan repeated, not quite grasping the point.\n \"yeah Curtis dug a pack of Winstons and a lighter from his jeans pocket. \"Charlies. Gooks. Whatever you dudes called \u0027em back then.\n You kill more than twenty of \u0027em?\"\n Joe pushed the brim of his cap up. \"You fellas don\u0027t have anythin\u0027 better to do than invade a man\u0027s privacy?\"\n \"No,\" Curtis said as he lit up. \"We ain\u0027t hurtin\u0027anythin\u0027 by askin, are we, Dan? I mean, you\u0027re proud to be a vet, ain\u0027t you?\"\n \"Yes, I am.\" Dan sipped his\" tea again. Most of the Death Valley regulars knew about his tour of duty, not because he particularly cared to crow about it but because Curtis had asked him where held gotten the tattoo. @is @ a big mouth and he was on the dumb side: a bad combination.\n \"I\u0027m proud I served my country,\" Dan said.\n \"Yeah, you didn\u0027t run to Canada like them draft-dodgin\u0027 fuckers did, huh?\" Steve asked. He was a few years older than Curtis, had keen blue eyes and a chest as big as a beer keg.\n \"No,\" Dan answered, \"I did what I was told.\"\n \"So how many?\" Curtis urged. \"More than twenty?\"\n Dan released a long, weary breath. The sun was beating down on his skull, even through the baseball cap. \"Does it really matter?\"\n \"We want to know,\" Curtis said, the cigarette clenched between his teeth and his mouth leaking smoke. \"You kept a body count, didn\u0027t you?\"\n Dan stared straight ahead. He was looking at a chain-link fence.\n Beyond it was a wall of brown bricks. Sun and shadow lay worlds apart on that wall. In the air Dan could smell the burning.\n \"Talked to this vet once in Mobile,\" Curtis plowed on.\n \"Fella was one-legged. He said he kept a body count. Said he knew how many chinks he\u0027d killed right to the man.\"\n \"Jesus Christ!\" Joe said. \"Why don\u0027t you two go on and pester the shit outta somebody else? Can\u0027t you see Dan don\u0027t want to talk about it?\"\n \"He\u0027s got a voice,\" Steve replied. \"He can say if he wants to talk about it or not.\"\n Dan could sense Joe was about to stand up from his chair.\n When Joe stood up, it was either to go after a ticket or knock the ugly out of somebody. \"I didn\u0027t keep a body count,\" Dan said before Joe could leave the folding chair. \"I just did my job.\"\n \"But you can kinda figure out how many, right?\" Curtis wasn\u0027t about to give up until he\u0027d gnawed all the meat off this particular bone. \"Like more or less than twenty?\"\n A slow pinwheel of memories had begun to turn in Dan\u0027s mind.\n These memories were never far from him, even on the best of days. in that slow pinwheel were fragments of scenes and events: mortar shells blasting dirt showers in a jungle where the sunlight was cut to a murky gloom; rice paddies a The Good Son shimmering in the noonday heat; helicopters circling overhead while soldiers screamed for help over their radios and sniper bullets ripped the air; the false neon joy of Saigon\u0027s streets and bars; dark shapes unseen yet felt, and human excrement lying within the perimeter wire to mark the contempt the Cong had for Uncle Sam\u0027s young men; rockets scrawling white and red across the twilight sky; AnnMargret in thigh-high boots and pink hot pants, dancing the frug at a USO show; the body of a Cong soldier, a boy maybe fifteen years old, who had stepped on a mine and been blown apart and flies forming a black mask on his bloody face; a firelight in a muddy clearing, and a terrified voice yelling motherfucker motherfucker motherfucker like a strange mantra; the silver rain, drenching the trees and vines and grass, the hair and skin and eyes and not one drop of it clean; and the village.\n Oh, yes. The village.\n Dan\u0027s mouth was very dry. He took another swallow of tea. The ice was almost gone. He could feel the men waiting for him to speak, and he knew they wouldn\u0027t leave him alone until he did. \"More than twenty.\"\n \"Hot damn, I knew it!\" Grinning, Curtis elbowed Steve in the ribs and held out his palm. \"Cough it up, friend!\"\n \"Okay, okay.\" Steve brought out a battered wallet, opened it, and slapped a five-dollar bill into Curtis Nowell\u0027s hand. \"I\u0027ll get it back sooner or later.\"\n \"You boys ain\u0027t got trouble enough, you gotta gamble your money away?\" Joe sneered.\n Dan set his cup down. A hot pulse had begun beating at his temples. \"You laid a bet,\" he said as he lifted a wintry gaze to the two men, \"on how many corpses I left in \u0027Nam?\"\n \"Yeah, I bet it\u0027d be more than twenty,\" Curtis said, \"and Steve bet it\u0027d be-\u0027 , I \"I get the drift.\" Dan stood up. It was a slow, easy movement though it hurt his knees. \"You used me and what I did to win you some cash, Curtis?\"\n \"Sure did.\" It was said proudly. Curtis started to push the river into his pocket.\n \"Let me see the money.\"\n Still grinning, Curtis held the bill out.\n Dan didn\u0027t smile. His hand whipped forward, took the money, and had it in his grip before Curtis\u0027s grin could drop. \"Whoa!\" Curtis said. \"Give it here, man!\"\n \"You used me and what I did? What I lived through? I think I deserve half of this, don\u0027t you?\" Without hesitation, Dan tore the bill in two.\n \"Hey, man! It\u0027s against the fuckin\u0027law to tear up money!\"\n \"Sue me. Here\u0027s your half.\"\n Curtis\u0027s face had reddened. \"I oughta bust your fuckin, head is what I oughta do!\"\n \"Maybe you ought to. Try, at least.\"\n Sensing trouble, a few of the other men had started edging closer.\n Curtis\u0027s grin returned, only this time it was mean. \"I could take you with one hand, you skinny old bastard.\"\n \u0027You might be right about that.\" Dan watched the younger man\u0027s eyes, knowing that in them he would see the punch coming before Curtis\u0027s arm was cocked for the strike.\n \"Might be. But before you try, I want you to know that I haven\u0027t raised my hand in anger to a man since I left\u0027Nam. I wasn\u0027t the best soldier, but I did my job and nobody could ever say I\u0027d gone south.\"\n Dan saw a nerve in Curries left eyelid begin to tick. Curtis was close to swinging. \"If you swing on me,\" Dan said calmly, \"you\u0027ll have to kill me to put me down. I won\u0027t be used or made a fool of, and I won\u0027t have you winnin\u0027 a bet on how many bodies I left in my footprints. Do you understand that, Curtis?\"\n \"I think you\u0027re full of shit,\" Curtis said, but his grin had weakened. Blisters of sweat glistened on his cheeks and forehead. He glanced to the right and left, taking in the half-dozen or so onlookers, then back to Dan. \"You think you\u0027re something\u0027 special \u0027cause you\u0027re a vet?\"\n \"Nothin\u0027 special about me,\" Dan answered. \"I just want you to know that I learned how to kill over there. I got better at it than I wanted to be. I didn\u0027t kill all those Cong with a gun or a knife. Some of \u0027em I had to use my hands. Curtis, I love peace more than any man alive, but I won\u0027t take disrespect. So go on and swing if you want to, I\u0027m not goin\u0027 anywhere.\"\n \"Man, I could break your damn neck with one punch,\" Curtis said, but the way he said it told Dan he was trying to decide whether to push this thing any further.\n Dan waited. The decision was not his to make.\n A few seconds ticked past. Dan and Curtis stared at each other.\n \"Awful hot to be fightin\u0027,\" Joe said. \"Grown men, I swear!\"\n \"Hell, it\u0027s only five dollars,\" Steve added.\n Curtis took a deep drag on his cigarette and exhaled smoke through his nostrils. Dan kept watching him, his gaze steady and his face placid though the pain in his skull had racheted up a notch.\n \"Shit,\" Curtis said at last. He spat out a shred of tobacco.\n \"Give it here, then.\" He took the half that Dan offered.\n \"Keep you from tapin\u0027 it back together and spendin\u0027 it, at least.\"\n \"There ya go. Ya\u0027ll kiss and make up,\" Joe suggested.\n Curtis laughed, and Dan allowed a smile. The men who\u0027d thronged around began moving away. Dan knew that Curtis wasn\u0027t a bad fellow; Curtis just had a bad attitude sometimes and needed a little sense knocked into him. But on this day, with the sun burning down and no breeze stirring the weeds of Death Valley, Dan was very glad push had not come to shove.\n \"Sorry,\" Steve told him. \"Guess we didn\u0027t think it\u0027d bother you.\n The bet, I mean.\"\n \"Now you know. Let\u0027s forget it, all right?\"\n Curtis and Steve moved off. Dan took the Excedrin bottle from his pocket and popped another aspirin. His palms were damp, not from fear of Curtis, but from fear of what he might have done had that particular demon been loosed.\n \"You okay?\" Joe was watching him carefully.\n \"Yeah. Headache.\"\n \"You get a lot of those, don\u0027t you?\"\n \"A few.\"\n \"You seen a doctor?\"\n \"Yeah.\" Dan put the bottle away. \"Says it\u0027s migraine.\"\n \"Is that so?\"\n \"Uh-huh.\" He knows I\u0027m lyin\u0027, Dan thought. There was no need to tell any of the men here about his sickness. He crunched the aspirin between his teeth and washed it down with the last of his iced tea.\n \"Curtis is gonna get his clock cleaned one fine day\", im said.\n \"Fella don\u0027t have no sense.\"\n \"He hasn\u0027t @ved enough, that\u0027s his problem.\"\n \"Right. Not like us old relics, huh?\" Joe looked up at the sky, measuring the journey of the sun. \"Did you see some hell over there, Dan?\"\n Dan settled himself back down beside his friend\u0027s chair.\n He let the question hang for a moment, and then he said, \"I did.\n We all did.\"\n \"I just missed getting\u0027 drafted. I supported you fellas all the way, though. I didn\u0027t march in the streets or nothin\u0027.\"\n \"Might\u0027ve been better if you had. We were over there way too long.\"\n \"We could\u0027ve won it,\" Joe said. \"Yessir. We could\u0027ve swept the floor with them bastards if we\u0027d just-\" \"That\u0027s what I used to think,\"\n Dan interrupted quietly. \"I used to think if it wasn\u0027t for the protesters, we could\u0027ve turned that damn country into a big asphalt parkin\u0027lot.\" He drew his knees up to his chest. The aspirin was kicking in now, dulling the pain. \"Then I went up to Washington, and I walked along that wall. You know, where the names are.\n Lots of names up there. Fellas I knew. Young boys, eighteen and nineteen, and what was left of \u0027em wouldn\u0027t fill a bucket. I\u0027ve thought and thought about it, but I can\u0027t fipre out what we would\u0027ve had if we\u0027d won. If we\u0027d killed every Charlie to a man, if we\u0027d marched right into Hanoi and torched it to the ground, if we\u0027d come home the heroes like the Desert Storm boys did ... what would we have won?\"\n \"Respect, I guess,\" Joe said.\n \"No, not even that. It was past time to get out. I knew it when I saw all those names on that black wall. When I saw mothers and fathers tracin\u0027 their dead sons\u0027 names on paper to take home with \u0027em because that\u0027s all they had left, I knew the protesters were right. We never could\u0027ve won it.\n Never.\"\n \"Gone south,\" Joe said.\n \"What?\"\n @\u0027Gone south. You told Curtis nobody could ever say you\u0027d gone south. What\u0027s that mean?\"\n Dan realized he\u0027d used the term, but hearing it from the mouth of another man had taken him by surprise. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gone-south/page-1.html","bookId":2479,"book":{"id":2479,"title":"Gone South","description":"Storyline: \n Flooded by memories, poisoned by Agent Orange, Dan Lambert kills a man in a moment of fear and fury -- and changes his life forever.
