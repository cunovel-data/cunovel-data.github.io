A vehicle -one of only the dozen or so they\u0027d seen on the road all day-was approaching from the direction of Vermilion. In another few seconds Flint saw it wasn\u0027t a station wagon but a truck about the size of a moving van. As the truck grew nearer, Flint made out the blue lettering on its side: BiuscoE PR G Co. Under that was BATON RouGE, LA. The truck rumbled past them and kept going south, took a curve, and was gone from sight.\n \"I don\u0027t think Lambert\u0027s comin\u0027,\" Pelvis said. \"Should\u0027ve been here by now if he was.\"\n \"We\u0027re waitin\u0027 right here.

It was eighteen minutes until four.\n Eisley was right; it was time to make a call to Smoates again. But Flint didn\u0027t want to drive into Vermilion to use the phone, because if Lambert was coming, it would be across that bridge and Flint didn\u0027t care to be spotted. It would be easier to take Lambert when he thought he was safe in the cabin rather than chasing him north on the highway.\n Flint looked in the on the truck had gone.\n There had to be some men of\n [email protected]\n /* */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t\u003ddocument.currentScript||function(){for(t\u003ddocument.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027),e\u003dt.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\u0027data-cfhash\u0027))return t[e]}();if(t\u0026\u0026(c\u003dt.previousSibling)){p\u003dt.parentNode;if(a\u003dc.getAttribute(\u0027data-cfemail\u0027)){for(e\u003d\u0027\u0027,r\u003d\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(0,2)|0,n\u003d2;a.length-n;n+\u003d2)e+\u003d\u0027%\u0027+(\u00270\u0027+(\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* */\n farther south. He unfolded his Louisiana road map, one of a half-dozen state maps he always kqA in the car, and found the dot of Vermilion. About four or five miles south of that was another speck called Chandalac, and then Highway 57 ended three miles or so later at a place named LaPierre.\n Beyond that was swampland all the way to the Gulf of Mexico.\n The track WO to be going somewhere, and thae Md to be at least one pay phone down there, too. Flint started the engine and eased the Eldorado out of its hiding place ignored Pelvis\u0027s question of \"Where we headed?\" and turned right, the sun\u0027s glare sitting like a fireball on the long black hood.\n In the brutal afternoon light they could see the type of country they\u0027d driven through in darkness: on both sides of the road the flat, marshy land was aitemateiy cut by winding channels Of gray water and then stubbled with thick stands Of Palmettos and huge ancient oak trees. Around the next curve a brown snake that had to be a yard long was writhing on the hot pavement on Flint\u0027s side of the roa and he figured the truck had just crushed it a couple of minutes earlier. Fris spine crawled as the car passed over it, and when he glanced in the rearview mu\u0027ror he saw two hulking birds that must\u0027ve been vultures swoop down on the dying reptile and start tearing it to pieces with their beaks.\n Flint didn\u0027t believe in omens. NevertheleW he hoped this wasn\u0027t one.\n They\u0027d gone maybe a couple of miles when the spiny woods ell way th w f a On the right side of the road and e sun glittered off a blue channel of water that meandered out of what aPPeared to be primeval swamp. just ahead was a white clapboard building with a tin roof and a AM that said V ON MAMA GRmmEs, and jutting off from sho.\n was a pier where several small boats were tied up. one WW craft-a @P boat, Flint thought it was because of e th nets and various hoists aboard-had just arrived and its crew was tying ropes down to the pier. And there sat the B PrOcessing Company tr ck as well, n t t.\n the clapboard building with its loading bay facing the pier.\n Beside the marina, near a sun-bleached sign that adv live bait chewing tobacco, and fresh onions, stood a phone booth.\n Flint pulled the car to a stop on a surface of crushed OYster shells. He buttoned up his shirt and into his loose-fitting suit jacket. \"Stay here,\" he instructed Pelvis as he got out!! \"I\u0027ll be right back.\" He\u0027d taken three strides toward the phone booth when he heard the El dorado\u0027s passenger door creak open and Pelvis was climbing out with Mama tucked under his arm. \"Just go on \u0027bout your business,\" Pelvis said when Flint fired a glare at him. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 in there and get me some vittles. You want anydiin\u0027r\u0027 \"No.\" Vittles, Flint thought. Wasn\u0027t that what Granny fixed on \"The Beverly Hillbillies\"? \"Wait. Yeah, I do,\" he decided. \"Get me a bottle of lemon juice, if they\u0027ve got it.\n And don\u0027t go in there and flap your lips about Lambert, hear me?\n Anybody asks, you\u0027re here to do some fishin\u0027. Understand?\"\n \"You don\u0027t think I\u0027ve got a lick of sense, do your\u0027 \"Bingo,\" Flint said, and he turned his back on Pelvis and went into the phone booth.\n He placed a call through to Smoates\u0027s office. \"It\u0027s Flint,\" he said when Smoates answered. \"What\u0027s the situation on Lambert?\"\n \"Hold on a minute.\"\n Flint waited, sweat trickling down his face. It had to be over ninety degrees, even as the sun began to fall toward the west. The heat had sinned Clint, who lay motionles The air smelled of the steamy, sickly sweet reek of the swamp, and his own bodily aroma wasn\u0027t too delicate, either. He wasn\u0027t used to being unclean; a gentleman knew the value of cleanliness, of crisp white shirts and freshly [email protected] underwear. These last twenty-four hours had been a little slice of hell on earth, and this swampland Satan\u0027s paradise, too. From where he was standing, Flint could see four men unloading cargo from the shrimp boat.\n The cargo was umnish-brown and scaly, with long snouts bound shut by- copper wire, four stubby legs fastened together with wire as well.\n Alligators, he with a start. The men were unloading alhptors, each three or four feet long, from the deck of the boat and then carrying them to the Briwm Processing Company truck and heaving them into the back. The men\u0027s workclothes were wet and muddy, the boat\u0027s deck heaped with maybe twenty or more live and squirming alhptors. But there was a fifth man-slimmer than the others, with shoulder-length grayish-blond hair and wearing blue jeans and a Harvard T-shirt-who stood apart from the workers and seemed to be supervising. As Flint watched, the man in the Harvard T-shirt glanced at him and the sun flared in the round lenses of his dark glasses. The glance became a lingering stare.\n \"Flint?\" Smoates had come back on the line. \"Latest word\u0027s that Lambert\u0027s still on the loose. iftere are your! \"Down south. Little hellhole called Vermilion. I want you to know I\u0027m standin\u0027 here watchin\u0027 a bunch of geeks unload [email protected] live alligators off a boat.\"\n \"You ought to ask \u0027em if they need a hand,\" Smoates said with a wet chuckle.\n Flint chose to let the remark pass. \"I came close to nailing Lambert last night.\"\n \"You\u0027re shittin\u0027 me! He showed up at the ex-wife\u0027s house?\"\n \"No, not there. But I found him. I think he\u0027s on his way here, too. Probably holed up somewhere and gonna be on the move W\" after dark.\" Flint saw the man in the Harvard T-shirt still staring at him; then the dude motioned One Of the workers-a shirtless, shaven-headed wall of a black man who must\u0027ve stood six-four and weighed close to three hundred Pounds-over to him and they started talking, their backs toward the phone booth, as the others continued to unload the alligators and throw them into the truck. \"Smoates,\" Flint said, \"Eisley\u0027s drivin\u0027 me crazy.\n Even God couldn\u0027t get him to shut his mouth. I don\u0027t know what you saw in him, but he\u0027s all wrong for the job.\"\n \"So he talks a lot, so what? That could be a plus. He\u0027s got the ability to wear people down.\"\n \"Yeah, he\u0027s good at that, all right. But he\u0027s slow upstairs.\n He can\u0027t think on his feet. I\u0027d hate to be in a tight spot and have to depend on him, I\u0027ll tell you that.\n \"Forget about Eisley for a minute. You ain\u0027t heard the news, huhr, What news?\"\n \"Lambert\u0027s a double murderer now. He killed a fella at a motel outside Alexandria \u0027round midnight. Blasted him with a shotgun, and when the fella didn\u0027t die fast enough, Lambert beat him to death. Stole his station wagon. Cable TV\u0027s picked up the story, it\u0027s on every hour.\"\n \"He was in the station wagon when I found him. I would\u0027ve had him, but his ex-wife helped him get away.\"\n \"Well, sounds to me like Lambert\u0027s turned into a mad dog. Man who\u0027s killed twice won\u0027t think nothin\"bout killin\u0027 a third time, so watch your ass.\"\n \"He\u0027s in the grocery store right now,\" Flint said.\n \"Huh? Oh, yeah! Ha! See, Flint? Eisley\u0027s givin\u0027 you a sense of humor,\" \"It\u0027s his lack of sense I\u0027m worried about. I\u0027ve done all right at stayin\u0027 alive so far, but that was before you shackled him on me.\"\n \"He\u0027s gotta learn the ropes somehow,\" Smoates said.\n \"Just like you did.\" He paused for a moment, then released a heavy sigh. \"Well, I reckon you\u0027re right. Lambert\u0027s an awful dangerous skin to train Eisley on. Neither one of you are any good to me in a grave, so you can call it quits and come on in if you want to.\"\n Flint was knocked off his wheels. He thought the earth might shake and the heavens crack open. Smoates was offering him a way out of this nightmare.\n \"You still there, Flint?\"\n \"lib ... yeah. Yeah, I\u0027m here.\" His joy had been a short-lived thing. He was thinking the unthinkable; he needed his share of the reward money for his pmbffi% debts, and if Lambert was coming to the cabin after dark, it would be foolish to give up and go back to Shreveport now.\n Then again, Lambert might not even be in Louisiana anymore. It was Flint\u0027s call to make. He had the can of Mace and his brass knuckles in the car\u0027s glove compartment, and Clint\u0027s derringer was in its small holster against the sidn under his right arm. The derringer\u0027s bullets didn\u0027t have much stopping power, but no man-not even a mad dog Vietnam vet-was going to do a whole lot of running or fighting with a hole through his kneecap. \"If Lambert shows up here,\" Flint said, \"I believe I can take him. I\u0027ll hang in until tomorrow mornin\u0027.\"\n \"You don\u0027t have to prove anythin\u0027. I know what you can do. But somebody as @ as Lambert could be awful unpredictable.vi Flint grunted. \"Smoates, if I didn\u0027t know you better, I\u0027d think you were concerned about me. \"You\u0027ve been a damn fine investment.\n Eisley\u0027s gonna turn out to be a good investment, too, once he gets the green worn off @.\"\n \"oh, I see- Well, just so I know where I stand.\u0027$ He wiped sweat from his eyebrows with his sleeve. The long-haired man in the Harvard T-shirt was watching the others work again, and paying Flint no attention. \"I\u0027ll stay here awhile lonw- If Lambert doesn\u0027t show by six in the mornin I,ll start back . 09 \"Okay, play it how you want.\"\n \"I\u0027ll check in again around dark.\" Flint hung the phone back on its cradle. He was drenched with sweat under his jacket and totally miserable. Still, the game had to be played out. He saw that EisleY hadn\u0027t returned to the car, and when he looked through a window into the store he saw Pelvis @(hng at the cash register eating an ice men sandwich as he talked to a fat red-haired girl behind the counter. The girl wore an expression of rapture on her PudgY-cheeked face, and Flint [email protected] it wasnt every day she had a customer like him. Flint spotted a sign that said REST Rooms and there was an arrow pointing around the side Of the building. He followed it and found two doors, one [email protected] and the other GAU. The Gem door had a hole where the knob should\u0027ve been. As he pushed through the door, he was aware of the sounds of distress the\n [email protected]\n alligators were making as they were being thrown into the truck, a combination Of guttural burps and higherPitched bleats. He figured the thinp were going to Baton Rouge to wind up as shoes, belts, and purses. Hell of a way to make a living, that was.\n Flint @ in a small bathroom that smelled stroney of LYsol, but there were other more disagreeable odors wafting about as well. One of the two urinals seemed to have moss growing in it, and the other held a dark yellow @ clogged with ciprette butts. He didn\u0027t care to take a look into the toilet stall. He chose the mossy urinal, which had a Tropical Nights condoms machine mounted on the wall above it, and he unzipped his pants and went about the task.\n As he relieved himself, he thought about what Smoates had said: Man who\u0027s killed twice won\u0027t think nothin\u0027 \u0027bout killin\u0027a third time.\n So why, Flint wondered, am I still alive?\n Lambert had just come from his second murder, and he wouldn\u0027t have had much to lose by a third, especially the execution of a bounty hunter who\u0027d tracked him from Shreveport. Why hadn\u0027t Lambert used the gun when he\u0027d had the chance? Maybe because he hadn\u0027t wanted his ex-wife and son to be witnesses?\n It was selfdefense, Flint remembered the woman saying.\n He\u0027s not a cold-blooded killer.\n Lambert\u0027s turned into a mad dog, was Smoates\u0027s opinion.\n Which was the truth? I\u0027ll let the judge sort it out, Flint thought as he stared at the aged photo of a smiling, heavily made-up blond girl on the condom machine. He looked down to shake and zip.\n The edge of a straight razor was laid against the crown of Flint\u0027s penis, which suddenly and decisively dried up.\n \"Get the door.\"\n The door bumped shut.\n \"Easy, Men. Be cool, now. Don\u0027t pee on my hand. I wouldn\u0027t like it if you peed on my hand, I might get an bent ouua shape and this razor nught twitch.\" The long-han-ed man wearing round-lensed sunglasses and the Harvard T-shirt was standing beside Flint; he had a soft, almost feminine voice with just a hint of a refined southern accent, but he was jabbefin as if he might be running on speed.\n \"Wouldn\u0027t want that, man, no you wouldn\u0027t. Bummer to have all that blood shootin\u0027 out your stump. Messy, messy, messy. Virgil, find his wallet.\"\n An ebony hand the size of a roast slid into Flint\u0027s jacket and went to the inside pocket, almost grazing Clint.\n \"Just look straight ahead, man. Hold on to your joy stick, both hands. That\u0027s right. Car 54, where are you?\"\n \"No badge,\" Virgil said in a voice like a cement mixer turning over. I\u0027@u\u0027zona license. Name\u0027s Flint Murtaugh.\n Monroe address.\"\n \"Our man Flint!\" The razor remained where it was, a threat to three shriveled inches of Flint\u0027s flesh. \"Do not adjust the horizontal, do not adjust the vertical. We are in control. Talk to me.\"\n \"What\u0027s this all about?\" he managed to say though his throat had seized up.\n \"Beeeep! Wrong answer! I\u0027m askin\u0027 the questions, kemo sabe! Who are you and what\u0027re you doin\u0027 here?\"\n \"I\u0027m here to do some fishin\u0027.\"\n \"Oh, yeahhhhh! Fishin\u0027 he says, Virgil! What\u0027s your nose tell us?\"\n Flint heard the black man sniffing the air next to his face.\n \"Don\u0027t smell like no fisherman,\" Virgil rumbled. \"Got kinda like a cop smell, but...\" He kept sniffing.\n \"Somethin\u0027 real funny \u0027bout him.\"\n Flint turned his head to the left and looked into the dark lenses.\n The Harvard man, who stood about the S\u003de height as Flint, was in his late forties or early fifties. He was lean and sun-browned, gray grizzle covering the jaw of his deeply lined and weathered face. His hair had once been sandcolored, but most of it was now nearing silver.\n Part of his right ear looked as if it had been either chewed off or shot off. His T-shirt with the name of that hallowed university was mottled with sweat stains, and his blue jeans appeared to be held together by crusty patches of grime. Flint concluded his brief inspection by noting that the man wore TopSiders without sinks. \"I\u0027m not a cop,\" he said, lifting his gaze again to the opaque lenses. \"I came down to fish for the weekend, that\u0027s all.\"\n \"Wore Your best suit to fish in, did you? Come all the way here from Monroe just to hook a big mudcat? If you\u0027re a fisherman, I\u0027m Dobie Gillis.\"\n \"Ain\u0027t no fisherman.\" Virgil was standing on the other side of Flint, his broad bare chest smeared with \u0027Ptor mud.\n His nose had wide, flared nostrils and he wore purple paisley shorts and Nikes on size thirteen feet. \"Fish won\u0027t bite, weather this hot. Ain\u0027t been no fishermen \u0027round here all week.\"\n \"This is true,\" the man with the razor said. \"So, Flinty, what\u0027s your story?\"\n \"Look, I don\u0027t know who you fellas are or what this is about, but all I did was come in here to use the bathroom. If you want to rob me, go ahead and take my money, but I wish you\u0027d put the razor away.\"\n \"Maybe it\u0027s you who wants to rob us.\"\n \u0027What?\"\n \"I saw you on the phone, Flinty. You reached out and touched somebody. Who was it? Couldn\u0027t have been Victor Medina, could it?\n You one of his spies, FlintyT\u0027 \"I don\u0027t know any Victor Medina. I had to call my office.\"\n \"What line of work you in?\"\n \"I sell insurance,\" Flint answered.\n \"Smellin\u0027 a lie,\" Virgil said, sniffing.\n \"The nose knows. Virgil\u0027s got a mystic snout, Flinty. So let\u0027s try it again: what line of work you in?\"\n Flint couldn\u0027t tell these two swamp rats why he was really there, they\u0027d want the reward for themselves. Anger welled up inside him.\n \"I\u0027m an astronaut,\" he said before he could think better of it. \"What business is it of yours?\"\n \"Ohhhhhh, an astronaut, Virgil!\" The man grinned, his greenish celebrity here! What do you say about that?\"\n teeth in dire need of brushing. \"We\u0027ve got us a \"Say he wants it done the hard way, Doc.\"\n \"This is true.\" Doc nodded, his grin evaporating. \"The hard way it shall be, then.\"\n Virgil looked into the toilet stall. Now it was his turn to grin.\n \"Heh-heb! Somebody done forgot to flush!\"\n \"Oh me oh me oh my!\" Doc pulled the razor away from i Flint\u0027s penis and closed the blade with a quick snap of his i i wrist, and Flint took the opportunity to zip himself up out of harm\u0027s way. \"I believe this is a job for an astronaut, don\u0027t you?\"\n \"Surely.\" Virgil took a step forward and gripped the nape of Flint\u0027s neck with one huge hand while the other grasped Flint\u0027s right wrist and wrenched his krm up behind his back \u0027Hey, hey! Wait a minute!\" Flint yelled, true fear kicking his heart and pain shooting through his arm. Clint had awakened and was thrashing under his shirt, but Virgil was manhandling Flint like a sack of straw into the toilet stall Though Flint grabbed the stall\u0027s door with his left hand and tried to fight free, Virgil made short work of at attempt by th sweeping his legs out from under him and forcing him to his knees on the gritty flOOr. The hair rose up on the back of Flint\u0027s neck when he saw the brown mers in the slimy bowl and what might have been fist-size crabs down in the murk. scuttling around \"Yum-yum!\" Doc said.\n \"Candygram for Mongo!\"\n Virgil Pushed Flint\u0027S face toward the toilet bowl. The man\u0027s strength was awesome, and though Flint did his damnedest at resisting, all he could do was slow the inevitable. He couldn\u0027t get to the derringer and neither could he find the breath to command mt to get it. His 0 y h C\u0027 I\u0027ll ape was that he would pass Out before his face broke the scummY, clotted surface.\n \"sir?\"\n \u0027Doc turned his head toward the husky voice behind him.\n He gasped; Elvis Presley was standing there, framed by the hot w te are through the open doorw . D pp g hay ac stood in and stunned as Pelvis Eisley reached up with his left hand g, and plucked off the sunglasses. Doc blinked, his p-le een eyes overloaded with light.\n \" \u0027Scuse me,\" Pelvis sod, and he lifted his right hand the hand that held the red can Of Mace he\u0027d taken from the Cadillac\u0027s glove compartment-and sprayed a burst of fine mist squarely into Docis face.\n The reswt was immediate. DOC let out a wmam that curled Pelvis\u0027s ducktail, and he staggered back, raking at his inflamed eyeballs. In the toilet stall, Flint\u0027s nose was two inches away from disaster when the scream echoed off the t es and V \u0027s hand left the back of his head.\n Fling il \u0027rg\" ntiabbed an elbow backward into the man\u0027s chest, but Virgil just grunted and turned away to help Doc.\n \"Lord have mercy,\" Pelvis said when he saw the size of the black man who\u0027d just emerged from the toilet swing.\n Virgil took one look at Doc, who was down on the floor clutching his face with both hands and writhing in agony, then he stared at Pelvis as if seeing an alien from another planet. The shock didn\u0027t last but three seconds, after which Virgil charged Pelvis like a mad bull.\n Pelvis stood his ground and got off another spray of Mace, but Virgil saw it coming and he jerked his head to one side, throwing up a thick forearm to protect his face. The spray wet his shoulder and burned like the furies of Hell, but Virgil was still moving and he hit his target with a body block that all but knocked Pelvis out of his blue suede shoes.\n Pelvis slammed against the wall, his jowls and belly quaking, and Virgil chopped at his wrist and knocked the Mace out of his hand. The stomp of a Nike crushed the can flat.\n Virgil grabbed Pelvis by the throat and lifted him off his feet.\n Pelvis\u0027s eyes bulged as he started choking, his fingers scrabbling to loosen Virgil\u0027s massive hands.\n Flint had staggered out of the stall. He saw Pelvis\u0027s face swelling with blood and he knew he had to do somethinganything-fast.\n He yanked his shirt open, pulled the derringer from its holster, and cocked it. \"Leave him alone!\" Flint shouted, but Virgil paid no attention. There was no time for a second try. Flint @ped forward, pushing the derringers double barrels against the back of Virgil\u0027s left knee, and squeezed the trigger. The little weapon made only a polite firecracker pop, but the force of the slug couldn\u0027t help but shatter the big man\u0027s kneecap. Virgil cried out and released Pelvis, and he went down on the floor, gripping at the ruins of his knee.\n \"Gone pass out!\" Pelvis gasped. \"Lordy, I can\u0027t stand up!\"\n \"Yes you can!\" Flint saw his wallet on the floor where Virgil had dropped it, and he snatched it up and then took Pelvis\u0027s weight on his shoulder. \"Come on, move!\" He kicked the door open and pulled Pelvis out with him into the scorching light. The loading of the alligators was still proceeding, which made Flint think that the other three workmen had believed Doc\u0027s scream of pain to be his own.\n The red-haired grocery girl hid probably been too scared to come look; either that, or screams of pain were commonPlace around there.\n But then one of two workers carrying a squirming alligator along the pier saw them and let out a holler: \"Hey, Mitch! Doc and Virgil are down! The third an was on the boat, and he reached under his muddy YellOw shirt and Pulled out a pistol before he came running across the gangplank.\n It was definitely time to vacate the premises.\n Pelvis, who could hardly stand up one second, was in the next second a fairly impressive sprinter. The man with the gun got off a shot that knocked a chunk of cinder block from the wall eight inches above Flint\u0027s head, and Flint fired the derringers other bullet without aiming though he knew he was Out Of range. All the workmen threw themselves flat on the pier, the\u0027gator landing belly-up. Then Flint was running for the car, too, where Mama was barking frantically in the drivers seat. He almost crushed her as he flung himself behind the wheel, and Pelvis did crush the sack of Twinkles, POtato chips, and cookies that occupied his own seat. Flint jammed the key in, started the engine, and drove away from the store in reverse. The man with the gun hadn\u0027t come around the corner yet. Flint put the pedal to the metal, the engine still shrieking in reverse.\n And then there was the gunman, skidding around the building\u0027s edge. He planted his feet in a firing stance and took aim at the retreating car. Flint shouted, \"Get down! and Pelvis ducked his head, both arms clutching Mama. But before the man could pull the trigger, the Eldorado got behind the cover of woods and Flint\u0027s heart fell back into his chest from where it had lodged in his throat. He kept racing backward another fifty yards before he found a clear place on the weedy shoulder to turn the car around, then he gave it the gas again.\n Pelvis had hesitantly lifted his head. The first faint blue bruises were coming up on his neck. \"I come to the bathmom and heard\u0027em in there!\" he croaked over the howl of wind and engine. --Looked through the hole in the door and seen \u0027em tryin\u0027 to rob you! I \u0027membered what you said \u0027bout the Mace blindin\u0027 a man!\"\n \"They were crazy, that\u0027s what they were!\" Flint\u0027s face glistened with sweat, his eyes darting back and forth from the rearview mirror to the road. The truck wasn\u0027t following.\n He cut his speed to keep from flying off the dangerous curves into the marsh. Clint was still writhing, as if he shared his brother\u0027s fury. \"Goddamned swamp rats, tried to drown me!\" Still the truck wasn\u0027t following, and Flint eased up on the gas some more. Pelvis kept looking back, too, his face mottled with crimson splotches. \"I don\u0027t see \u0027em yeti\" In another moment Flint realized-or hoped-the truck wasn\u0027t coming after them at all. The dirt road where they\u0027d been sitting watching for Lambert would soon be on the left.\n It was time to take a gamble. What were the odds that the truck was following as opposed to the odds that it was not?\n Doc probably couldn\u0027t see yet, and Virgil was going to need a stretcher. Flint put his foot on the brake as they approached the dirt road.\n \"What\u0027re you doin\u0027? You ain\u0027t stoppin\u0027, are you?\" Pelvis squawked.\n \"I\u0027m here to get Lambert,\" Flint said as he backed off the highway into the shade of the weeping willows once more.\n \"I\u0027m not lettin\u0027 a bunch of swamp rats run me off.\" He got far enough down the road so as not to be seen by anyone coming from either direction, then he opened the glove compartment, brought out a box of bullets for the derringer, and reloaded its chambers. He cut the engine, and they sat there, all four of them breathing hard.\n A minute passed. \"That toy gun nught do fine in a pinch,\" Pelvis said, \"but I wouldn\u0027t stake my life on it.\" Flint didn\u0027t respond.\n Five minutes went by, during which Pelvis kept mumbling to himself or Mama. kiter fifteen minutes they heard a vehicle approaching from the south. \"Oh, Lord, here they come!\" Pelvis said, scrunching down in his seat.\n The truck passed their hiding place at a lawful speed and kept going. They listened to it moving away, and then its sound faded.\n \"I\u0027ll be.\" Pelvis sat up, wincing as pain lanced his lower back.\n If he hadn\u0027t been carrying such a Pad of fat around his midsection, he might be laid out on the bathroom floor right then.\n \"What do you make of that?\n Flint shook his head. A lot Of strange things had happened to him in his bounty-hunting career, but this might have been the strangest.\n What had all that been about? Doc and Virgil hadn\u0027t been trying to rob him; they\u0027d wanted to know who he was, why he was there, and who he\u0027d been talking to on the phone. \"Damned if I can figure it out.\" He slid Clint\u0027s derringer back into its holster. \"You all right?\n \"Hurtin\u0027 some, but I reckon I\u0027ni okay.\"\n Flint kept listening for a siren that would be an ambulance or police car. If the cops showed up, they could wreck everything. But he was starting to have the feeling that the swamp rats didn\u0027t care to see the police around, either. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gone-south/page-15.html","bookId":2479,"book":{"id":2479,"title":"Gone South","description":"Storyline: \n Flooded by memories, poisoned by Agent Orange, Dan Lambert kills a man in a moment of fear and fury -- and changes his life forever.
