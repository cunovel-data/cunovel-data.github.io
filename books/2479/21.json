When he opened them,.Arden was still glowering at him. \"You could argue the horns off a billy goat, you know that? There is no Bright Girl, and there never wa.V. It\u0027s a made-up story!\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what you say.\"\\n\\n He saw no point in going around in circles with her.\\n\\n \"Right, that\u0027s what I say,\" he muttered, and then he concentrated on putting some elbow grease into the paddling. The current seemed to have gotten a little faster, which he thought must be a good sign. He was hungry and thirsty and his headache had returned, pounding with his heartbeat. Dried blood was in his nostrils, he\u0027d lost his [email protected] baseball cap and his muscles-what remained of them, that is-were rapidly wearing out. The water was rising in the bottom of the boat again, and Dan put aside the paddle for a few minutes while he and Arden cupped their hands and bailed. Then he shook off the sleep that was closing in on him and-paddled them down the center of the bayou with slow, smooth strokes. He watched Arden\u0027s head droop as she fell asleep sitting up, and then he was alone with the noises of the swamp.\\n\\n After a while his eyelids became leaden and he couldn\u0027t keep them open.\\n\\n The heat pressed on him, lulling him to sleep. He fought it as hard as he could, but at last his weariness won the battle and his chin slumped.\\n\\n He jerked his head up, his eyes openingThey had drifted toward the left of the channel and were almost in the branches. Dan steered them toward the center again, and then he heard the sound that had awakened him: a muffled thudding like the heartbeats of a giant. Ahead and to the right, electric lights glinted through the thick woods.\\n\\n Dan looked at his wristwatch and saw that another hour had elapsed since they\u0027d entered the wider channel.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that noise?\" Arden asked, waking up almost as quickly as he had.\\n\\n \"Machinery,\" he said. \"I think we\u0027re comin\u0027 to something\u0027.\"\\n\\n Around the next curve the trees had been chopped away on the right to make room for a hodgepodge of weatherbeaten clapboard structures built on platforms over the water. Electric lights cast their glary circles on a dock where an assortment of motor skiffs and two houseboats were tied up. On the dock were gas pumps and an attendant\u0027s shack, also lit up with electricity supplied from a rumbling generator.\\n\\n Plank walkways connected the buildings, and Dan and Arden saw two men standing in conversation next to the gas pumps and a couple of other men on the walkways. A rusty barge loaded with sections of metal pipe, coils of wire, and other industrial items was anchored past the dock at a concrete pier where a long building with corrupted aluminum walls stood, the legend WAREHOUSE # I painted in red across the building\u0027s doorway. Beyond the warehouse loomed oil storage tanks and twelve or more spidery derricks rising up from the swamp. The giant heartbeat-the sound of pumps at work-was coming from that direction.\\n\\n The entire scene-a large, mechanized oil-pumping station, Dan had realized-was almost surrealistic, emerging as it had from the dark wilderness. As he steered them toward the dock, he saw a pole that held a tired-looking American flag and next to it was a sign on stilts that announced sr. NAsTAsE, LA. HOME swEET HELLHOLE. On the supporting stilts were a number of other directional arrows with such things as NEW 0 NS 52 MI BATON RouGE 76 mi and\\n\\n [email protected]\\n\\n /* */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t\u003ddocument.currentScript||function(){for(t\u003ddocument.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027),e\u003dt.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\u0027data-cfhash\u0027))return t[e]}();if(t\u0026\u0026(c\u003dt.previousSibling)){p\u003dt.parentNode;if(a\u003dc.getAttribute(\u0027data-cfemail\u0027)){for(e\u003d\u0027\u0027,r\u003d\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(0,2)|0,n\u003d2;a.length-n;n+\u003d2)e+\u003d\u0027%\u0027+(\u00270\u0027+(\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* */\\n\\n 2o8 mi.\\n\\n painted on them. One of the men on the dock picked up a line and tossed it to Arden as they approached, then he hauled them in. \"Hey there, how you doin\u0027?\" theinan asked in a thick Cajun patois. He was a husky, florid-faced gent with a red beard and a sweatstained bandanna wrapped around his skull.\\n\\n \"Tired and hungry,\" Dan told him as he carefully stood up and helped Arden onto the dock. \"Where are we?\"\\n\\n 2% \"Fella wanna know where he am,\" the Cajun said to other man, and both of them laughed. \"Friend, you must in some sad shape!\"\\n\\n Dan stepped onto the timbers, his spine unkinking. \"I mean how far from here to the Gulf?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, blue water\u0027bout tree mile.\" He motioned south with a crusty thumb. His gaze lingered on Arden\u0027s birthmark for a few seconds, then he diverted his attention to the waterlogged skiff. \"I seen some crackass boats before, but that\u0027un done win the prize! Where ya\u0027ll come from?\"\\n\\n \"North,\" Dan said. \"Anyplace to get some food herer \"Yeah, cafe\u0027s over there.\" The second man, who spoke with a flat midwestern accent, nodded in the direction of the clapboard buildings. He was slimmer than his companion, wore a\u0027grease-stained brown cap with a red GSP on the front-a company logo, Dan figured-and had tattoos intertwining all over his arms. \"They got gumbo Emd hamburgers tonight. Ain\u0027t too bad if you wash \u0027em down with enough beer.\"\\n\\n A door on one of the houseboats opened, and another man emerged, buckling the belt of his blue jeans. He wore a company cap turned backward. Behind him, tape-recorded rock music rumbled through the doorway and then a woman with bleached-blond hair and a hard, sunburned face peered out. \"Okay!\" she said with forced cheerfulness.\\n\\n -All-night party, boys! Who\u0027s next?\"\\n\\n \"I believe I am.\" The man with tattooed arms sauntered toward the houseboat.\\n\\n \"Non, mon ami. \" The Cajun stepped forward, seized his companion by shirt back and pants seat, and, [email protected] lifted him off his feet and flung him from the dock. With a curse and squall the unfortunate flyer hit the water and slummed its surface like a powerboat before he went under.\\n\\n \"I believe you was!\" the Cajun hollered as his friend came up spitting. \"Hey, Lorraine!\" he greeted the bleached blonde. \"You got sweets for me?\"\\n\\n \"You know I do Tully. Get your big al\u0027 ass in here.\" She narrowed her eyes\u0027at Arden. \"New chickie, huh?\" She gave a throaty laugh. \"You gonna need a little makeup, darrin\u0027.\\n\\n Well, good luck to you.\" TulIy lumbered into the houseboat, and Lorraine closed the door behind them.\\n\\n It was time to move on. Dan ventured along one of the walkways, heading toward the buildings, and Arden followed close behind. The place made Dan think of a Wild West frontier town, except it had been built up from the muck instead of being carved from the desert. It was a carpenter\u0027s nightmare, the structures cobbled together with pressure-treated pineboards and capped by rusted tin roofs.\\n\\n Electrical cables snaked from building to building, carrying the juice from generator The walkways were so close to the water that in some places reeds stuck up between the planks.\\n\\n There was a store whose sign announced it as R.J\u0027S GROCERY and next to it was a little narrow structure marked sr. NAnAsE posr oFRcE. A Laundromat with three washers and dryers and two pool tables was lit up and doing business. Dan noted that the men they saw gazed hungrily at Arden\u0027s body, but when they looked at her face they averted their eyes as quickly as Tully had.\\n\\n St. Nastase, Dan had realized, most likely never closed down, to accommodate the crews who were off shift. Dan figured that the men here had siped on with the company for three or four months at a stretch, which meant prostitutes in houseboau could make some money plying their trade. It occurred to him that Lorraine had thought Arden was a \"new chickie\" because the only women who dared to go there were selling sex, and he was unaware of it but Arden had come to the same conclusions about ten seconds ahead of him.\\n\\n In another moment they heard the mingled music of a fiddle and an accordion. The smell of food caught their nostrils. Ahead was a building with a sign that said simply cAn. The place had a pair of batwing doors, like a western saloon. The music was coming from within, accompanied now by whoops and hollers. Dan figured this could be a hell of a rowdy joint, and again he wished Arden wasn\u0027t around because he was going to have to be responsible for her safety.\\n\\n He said, \"Stick close to me,\" and then Arden followed him a.\\n\\n through the batwings, her right hand clenching the pink drawstring bag.\\n\\n The cafe was dimly lit, blue-hazed with cigarette smoke, and at the ceiling a fan chugpd around in a futile attempt to circulate the humid, sweat-smelling air. Hanging from the ceiling as well were maybe three hundred old, dirty brown caps with red GSP logos. At rough plank tabla sat twenty or more men, a few of them clapping their hands in time with the jerky, mucous music, while four of their fellows danced with ladies of the evening. The fiddler and accordionist both wore company caps, and a thick-shouldered black men got up from his table, sat down at a battered old piano, and began to beat out a rhythm that added to the merry clamor.\\n\\n Some of the men glanced eagerly at Arden, but they looked away when Dan put\u0027his arm around her shoulders.\\n\\n He guided her toward a bar where metal beer @, canned soft drinks, and bottles of water were on display. Behind it, a horned-looking man with glasses, a beard, and slicked-back dark hair was drawing beer into mugs, sweat stains on ins red-chocked shirt and a cigar stub gripped between his teeth.\\n\\n \"Can we get\\n\\n [email protected]\u0027\\n\\n to eat?\" Dan asked over the noise, and the bartender said, \"Burgers a buck apiece, gumbo two bucks a bowl. Take the gumbo, the burgers taste @ dog meat.\"\\n\\n They both decided on the gumbo, wtuch the bartender ladled from a grease-filmed pot into plastic bowls. Arden asked for a bottle of water and Dan requested a beer, and as the bartender shoved trays and plastic spoons wrapped in cellophane at them, Dan said, \"I\u0027m @, to get this girl out of here. Is there a road anywhere nearbyr, \"A road?\" He snorted, and the tip of his cigar glowed red.\\n\\n \"Ain\u0027t no roads outta St. Nasty. Just water and mud. She a workin\u0027 girl?\"\\n\\n \"No. We\u0027re passin\u0027 through.\"\\n\\n The bartender stared at Dan, his eyes slightly magnified by the @ and he removed the cigar from his mouth.\\n\\n \"Passin\u0027 through,\" he @ted incrediflously. \"Now I\u0027ve heard it all. Ain\u0027t no man comes here unless he\u0027s drawin\u0027pay from Gulf States Petro, and no woman unless she\u0027s tryin\u0027 to get a man to spend it on her. Which insane asylum did ya\u0027ll get loose from?\"\\n\\n \"We had an accident. Went off a bridge north of UPierre.\\n\\n We got a boat, and-\" Dan stopped, because the bartender\u0027s eyes had gotten larger. \"Look, we\u0027re just tryin\u0027 to get out. Can you helpr us?\"\\n\\n \"Supply boat from Grand Isle oughta be here tomorrow afternoon.\\n\\n I\u0027d say you could hitch a ride with one of these ladies, but they\u0027ll be stayin\u0027 the weekend. Today was payday, see. Fridays and Saturdays, all these sumbitches wanna do is get drunk and screw wheu their shifts are over.\" He pushed the cigar stub back into his mouth. \"You come all the way from LaPierre? Jesus, that\u0027s a hell of a hike!\"\\n\\n \"Hey, Burt!\" a man yelled. \"Let\u0027s have our beers over here!\"\\n\\n \"Your legs ain\u0027t broke!\" Burt hollered back. \"Get off your ass and come get \u0027em, I ain\u0027t no slave!\" He returned his attention to Dan.\\n\\n \"An accident, huh? You want to call somebody? I got a radio-telephone in the back.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m lookin\u0027 for a woman,\". Arden said suddenly. \"The Bright Girl. Have you ever heard of her.9\" \"Nope,\" Burt replied. A man with a prostitute in tow came up to get his beers. \"Should I have?\"\\n\\n \"The Bright Girl\u0027s a healer. She lives in the swamp somewhere, and I\u0027m tryin\u0027 to-\" \"Arden?\" Dan caught hold of her elbow. \"I told you to stop that, didn\u0027t I?\"\\n\\n She pulled loose. \"I\u0027ve come a long way to find her,\" she said to Burt, and she heard the sharp, rising edge of desperation in her voice.\\n\\n Burt\u0027s eyes were blank, no idea of what she was talking about at all.\\n\\n Arden felt panic building inside her like a dark wave. \"The Bright Girl is here, somewhere,\" she said. \"I\u0027m gonna find her. I\u0027m not leavin\u0027 here until I find her.\"\\n\\n Burt took in the birthmark and looked at Dan. \"Like I asked before, what asylum did ya\u0027ll bust out of?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not crazy,\" Arden went on. \"The Bright Girl\u0027s real. I know she is. Somebody here has to have heard of her.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" Burt said. \"I don\u0027t know who you\u0027re talkin\u0027a-\" \"I know that name. Is Arden turned her head to the left. The prostitute who stood with the beer-swiller had spoken in a nasal drawl. She was a slight, rawboned girl wearing denim shorts and a faded orange blouse.\\n\\n Maybe she was in her early twenties, but her high-cheekboned, buck-toothed face had been @ maturely aged by scorching sun and harsh salt wind. Lines were starting to deepen around her mouth and at the corners of her dull, chocolate-brown eyes, and her peroxided hair cut in bangs across her forehead hung lifelessly around her bony shoulders.\\n\\n She stared with genuine interest at Arden\u0027s birthmark as her escort paid for two beers. \"Jeez,\" she said.\\n\\n \"You got fucked up awful bad, didn\u0027t ya?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" Arden\u0027s heart was pounding, and for a few seconds she felt on the verge of fainting. She said the edge of the bar with her free hand. \"You\u0027ve heard of the Bright Girlr\u0027 \"Uh-huh.\" The prostitute began to dig at a molar with a toothpick. \"Woman who healed people.\\n\\n Used to hear \u0027bout her when I was a little girl.\"\\n\\n .\u0027Do you know where she is?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" came the answer, \"I do.\"\\n\\n As Dan and Arcten had been- walking into the cafe, the man who\u0027d just gone for an unwilling swim sat on the dock in a puddle of water, watching another boat approach.\\n\\n There were two men in the boat. He couldn\u0027t quite trust his eyes.\\n\\n The man who was paddling wore a dark suit and a white shirt, which was not quite the normal attire out here at St. Nasty. The second man-well, maybe it was time to swear off the beers, because that sonofabitch Burt must be mixing the brew with toxic waste.\\n\\n When the boat bumped broadside against the dock, Flint stood up and stepped out. His mud-grimed suit jacket was buttoned up over his dirty shirt, the pale flesh of his face mottled with red mosquito bites, his eyes sunken in weary purple hollows. He stared at the battered and water-filled skiff tied upjust beside them, a single broken paddle lying in it. Nobody would\u0027ve traveled in that damn thing unless they\u0027d been forced to, he reasoned. \"How long have you been sittin\u0027 here?\" he asked the drenched man, who was watching Pelvis clamber out of the boat with Mama.\\n\\n \"You gotta be kiddin!\" the man said, unable to take his eyes off Pelvis. \"What is this, Candid Camera?\"\\n\\n \"Hey, listen up!\" Flint demanded, his patience at its bitter end.\\n\\n Clint-who was equally as tired and crankyjerked under his shirt, and Flint put an arm across his chest to hold his brother down. \"I\u0027m looking for a man and a woman. Shouldn\u0027t have been too long since they got here.\"\\n\\n He nodded at the sinking boat. \"Did you see who that belongs to?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, they\u0027re here. Sent \u0027em over to the cafe.\" -He couldn\u0027t help but stare at Pelvis. \"I know we\u0027re hurtin\u0027 for entertainment \u0027round here, but please don\u0027t tell me you\u0027re on the payroll.\"\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s the cafe? Which direction?\"\\n\\n \"Only one direction, unless you can walk on water.\\n\\n Scratch that,\" he decided, and he motioned at Pelvis with his thumb. \"Maybe he can walk on water.\"\\n\\n Flint started off toward the clapboard buildings, and Pelvis followed, leaving the man on the dock wondering what the next boat might bring. Others they passed stopped to gawk at Pelvis as well, and he started drawing catcalls and laughter. \"Hey!\" Flint called to two men @ding in the shadows next to the Laundromat/poolroom. \"The cafe around here?\"\\n\\n One of them pointed the way, and Flint and Pelvis went on. Flint reached into his pocket and put his hand on the derringers grip.\\n\\n \"Who the hell are they?\" the man who\u0027d pointed asked his friend.\\n\\n The second man, who had a long, vulpine face and close-cropped brown hair, ran his tongue across his lower lip. He wore faded jeans and a dirty yellow shirt with the tail hanging out, and the sweat on his flesh stitl smelled of swamp mud and alhptors. \"Friends of Doc\u0027s,\u0027 he said quietly. \"I believe he\u0027d like to see \u0027em again. Here.\" He slid a small packet of white powder into the other man\u0027s hand.\\n\\n \"Keep your money. Just do me a favor and watch those two.\\n\\n All right?\"\\n\\n \"Sure, Mitch. Whatever.\"\\n\\n \"Good boy.\" Mitch, who still had the pistol he\u0027d fired at Flint in his waistband, turned away and hurried to his motorboat, his mouth split by a savage grin.\\n\\n The King Bled Crimson \"Yeah,\" came the prostitute\u0027s answer. \"I do.\" She continued to probe with the toothpick as Arden\u0027s nerves stretched.\\n\\n \"Dead. Must be dead by now. She was old, lived in a church on Goat Island.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s bull!\" Burt said. \"Ain\u0027t nobody ever lived on Goat Island!\"\\n\\n \"Was a church there!\" the prostitute insisted. \"Blew down in a hurricane, back fifteen or twenty years! The Bright Girl was a nun fell in love with a priest, so they threw her out of her convent and she come down here and built a church to repent! That\u0027s what my mama said!\"\\n\\n \"Angle, you didn\u0027t have no mama!\" Burt winked at the girl\u0027s customer. \"She was hatched, wasn\u0027t she, Cal?\"\\n\\n \"Right out of a buzzard\u0027s egg,\" Cal agreed, his voice slurred by one too many brews.\\n\\n Angle jabbed an elbow into Cal\u0027s ribs. \"You don\u0027t know nothin\u0027, fool!\"\\n\\n Arden tried to speak, but her throat had seized up. The word dead was still ringing in her head like a funeral bell.\\n\\n \"Goat Island,\" she managed. \"Where is it?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t do this,\" Dan warned, but he knew there was no stopping her.\\n\\n \"Way the hell out in Terrebonne Bay,\" Burt said. \"Good ten miles from here. Got wild goats runnin\u0027 all over it, but there sure ain\u0027t never been no church out there.\"\\n\\n \"My mama wasn\u0027t no liar!\" Angle snapped. \"Youw even born \u0027round here, how do you know?\"\\n\\n \"I been huntin\u0027 on Goat Island before! Walked the length and width of it! if there\u0027d ever been a church there, I think I would\u0027ve seen some ruins!\"\\n\\n \"Miss?\" Dan said to the prostitute. \"You say the Bright Girl was an old woman?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. My mama said she seen her when she was a little girl.\\n\\n Came to Port Fourchon to see my mama\u0027s cousin. His name was Pearly, he was seven years old when he got burned up in a fire. Mama said the Bright Girl was crippled and walked with a white cane. I reckon that was\"-she paused to calculate-\"near thirty years ago.\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh.\" Dan felt Arden\u0027s body tensing beside him.\\n\\n But he decided he had to go the next step, too. \"What about Pearly\u0027.? Did your mama say the Bright Girl healed him?\"\\n\\n \"No, I recollect she said the Bright Girl took him with her in a boat.\"\\n\\n I.To where?\"\\n\\n \"Goat Island, I reckon. She never saw Pearly no more, though.\\n\\n Mama said she figured he was too bad off for even the Bright Girl to heal. But that was all right, \u0027cause the Bright Girl made sure he wasn\u0027t scairt when he went to heaven.\"\\n\\n \"Come on, baby!\" Cal grabbed Angie\u0027s thin arm and tugged at her.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s dance!\"\\n\\n \"Wait! Please!\" Arden\u0027s anguished voice cut to Dan\u0027s heart. \"Is she buried out there? Have you seen her grave?\u0027; \"No, I ain\u0027t seen her grave. But she\u0027s dead. Got to be dead after all this time.\"\\n\\n \"But you don\u0027t know for sure, do you? You\u0027re not certain she\u0027s dead?\"\\n\\n The prostitute stared at Arden for a few seconds and then pulled free of Cal\u0027s hand. \"I\u0027m certain as I need to be,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Ohhhhh.\" She nodded as things came clear to her.\\n\\n \"Ohhhhh, I see. You was lookin\u0027 for the Bright Girl to heal your face. Is that right?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, then. Far as I know, she\u0027s dead. I don\u0027t know where she\u0027s buried. I can ask some of the other girls. Most of lem were born \u0027round here, maybe they\u0027d know.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s dance!\" Cal yawped. \"Forget this shit!\" Both women ignored him. \"I\u0027d like to see the church,\" Arden said. \"Can you take me?\"\\n\\n \"No, I can\u0027t. See, I would, but I don\u0027t have my own boat.\\n\\n It\u0027s Lorraine\u0027s boat, and she don\u0027t take it nowhere but between here and Grand Isle.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, listen up, scarface!\" Cal slurred at Arden, his voice turning nasty. \"I\u0027m rentin\u0027 this bitch by the fuckin\u0027 hour, understand?\\n\\n I don\u0027t have no time to waste-\" \"Come over here a minute.\" Dan reached out, grasped Cal\u0027s wrist, and drew him closer, beer slopping to the floor from the mug in the man\u0027s hand. Dan\u0027s face was strained with anger, his eyes hard and shiny. \"The ladies are talkin\u0027.\"\\n\\n \"Mister, you let go of me or I\u0027m gonna have to knock the shit outta your ears!\"\\n\\n .\u0027No fightin\u0027 in here!\" Burt warned. \"You wanna fight, get out back!\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re drunk, friend.\" Dan kept his face close to Cal\u0027s, his arm low across the man\u0027s body so the beer mug wouldn\u0027t come up and smash him in the teeth. \"Don\u0027t let your mouth get you in trouble.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s all right,\" Arden said. The remark wasn\u0027t anything she hadn\u0027t heard before. \"Really it is.\"\\n\\n She suddenly caught a strong whiff of body odor and swamp mud.\\n\\n Someone wearing a dark suit stepped between her and Dan. She thought of vulture wings sweeping onto a dying jackrabbit.\\n\\n \"Lambert?\" A quiet voice spoke in Dan\u0027s ear. At the same time, Dan felt the little barrel of a gun press against his ribs.\\n\\n \"The game\u0027s over.\"\\n\\n Dan jerked his head around and looked into the pallid face he\u0027d seen by the flashlight\u0027s glare in Basile Park, only now it was blotched with mosquito bites. His heart jumped and fluttered like a trapped bird.\\n\\n Flint said, \"Take it very, very easy. Nobody needs to get hurt.\\n\\n Okay?\"\\n\\n 2N ik Beyond Murtaugh, Dan saw, [email protected] the Elvis Presley impersonator holding his squirming bulldog. The music had faltered and ended on a soawked note from the squeezebox. \u0027The Presley clone *as suddenly the center of attention, and he started drawing whistles and laughter.\\n\\n Flint glanced quickly at the girl and saw that what he\u0027d thought was a massive bruise was in fact a deep violet birthmark. \"You all right, Miss Halliday?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fine. Who are-\" $he realized then who it must be, and that he\u0027d looked through her purse back where they\u0027d gone off the bridge. / \"My name is Flint Murtaugh.

He hadn\u0027t seen the derringer Flint pressed against Dan\u0027s side, which was how Flint wanted it. \"Is it animal, veg\u0027table or mineral?\" He spouted smoke and looked at Flint. \"I swear to God, this is turnin\u0027 out to be a circus!\\n\\n Where\u0027d ya\u0027ll come from?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re with this fella hero,\" Flint answered. \"Just got left behind a little ways.\"\\n\\n \"Your friend\u0027s dressed up for Halloween early, ain\u0027t her\u0027 .\u0027He\u0027s a big Elvis fan.
