What time?\"\n \"An hour or so, I guess. But listen: if a policeman comes with me, or they won\u0027t let me take my own car, I won\u0027t be there. They might follow me without me knowin\u0027. Are you willin\u0027 to \" chance it?\"\n \"I am.\n \"All right. I\u0027m crazy for doin\u0027 it, but all right. I\u0027ll try to make it, but if I\u0027m not there-\" \"I\u0027ll wait as long as I can,\" Dan said.\n \"Thank you, Susan.\n You don\u0027t know how much this means to me.\"\n \"I\u0027ll try,\" she repeated, and then she hung up.\n He returned the receiver to its cradle. His spirit felt lightened.\n He and Susan had gone to several outdoor concerts at Basile Park, and he knew the amphitheater there. He checked his watch to give himself an hour, then he got back into the pickup truck and drove toward the Hideaway. He thought about the fifteen thousand dollars, and he wished he\u0027d seen that much money in a year\u0027s time. They wanted him caught fast, that was for sure.\n Before he reached the turnoff to the motor court, it crossed Dan\u0027s mind that Susan might be setting him up. The police might have been listening after all, and would be waiting for him at the park. There was no way to know for certain. He and Susan had parted on bitter terms, yes, but there had been some good times, hadn\u0027t there? A few good memories to hold on to? He remembered some, and he hoped she did.\n He was Chad\u0027s father, and that was a link to Susan that could never be broken. He would have to take the risk that she wasn\u0027t planning on turning him in. If she was ...\n well, he\u0027d cross that bridge when he came to it.\n He drove past the DeCaynes\u0027 house on the way to his cottage, and he was unaware that the sound of his engine awakened Hannah from a troubled sleep.\n She wasn\u0027t surt what had wakened her. Harmon was snoring in the other bed, his mouth a cavern. Hannah got up from under the sweat-damp sheet, her red hair-the texture of a Brillo pad-confined by a shower cap. She recalled bits and pieces of a nightmare she\u0027d had; the monster in it had been a warty frog with skinny human legs. Wearing only a bra and panties that barely held her jiggling mounds in check, she padded, into the kitchen, opened the refrigerator\u0027s freezer, and got an ice cube to rub over her face. The kitchen still smelled of blood and frog guts, and in the freezer were dozens of froglegs wrapped in butchers paper for delivery to the restaurant. While she was at it, Hannah opened the carton of vanilla ice cream that was in the freezer as well, and she got a spoon and took the carton with her to the front room to gorge herself until she was sleepy again.\n She switched on the radio, which was tuned to the local country music station. Garth Brooks was singing about Texas girls. Hannah walked to a window and pushed aside the curtain.\n The lights were on in Number Four. Something about that man she didn\u0027t like, she\u0027d decided. Of course, she didn\u0027t @ too many people to begin with, but that man in Number Four gave her a creepy feeling. He looked sick, for one thing. Skinny and pale, like he might have AIDS or something. She didn\u0027t like his tattoo, either. Her first husband had been in the merchant marine, was illustrated from wrists to shoulders, and she couldn\u0027t abide anything that reminded her of that shiftless sonofabitch.\n Well, he\u0027d be gone soon enough. They\u0027d be seven dollars richer, and every cent helped. Hannah plopped down on the sofa, her spoon strip-mining the ice cream. Reba McEntire serenaded her, and Hannah saw the bottom of the carton.\n The news came on, the newscaster talking about a fire last night in Pineville. The Alexandria town council was meeting to discuss pollution in the Red River. An Anandale woman had been arrested for abandoning her baby in the bus station\u0027s bathroom. A mentally disturbed Vietnam veteran had shot to death an official at a bank in Shreveport, and\". . . fifteen thousand dollars reward has been offered . . .\u0027$ Hannah\u0027s spoon paused in its digging.\n \". . . by the First Commercial Bank for the capture of Daniel Lewis Lambert. Police consider Lambert armed and extremely dangerous.\n Lambert was last seen driving a gray 1989 Chevrolet pickup truck. He is forty-two years old, six-feet-one with a slim build; he wears a beard and . . .\"\n Hannah had a mouthful of ice cream. She stared at the radio, her eyes widening.\n \". . . has the tattoo of a snake on his right forearm. Police advise extreme caution if Lambert is sighted. The number to call is.\n . .\"\n She couldn\u0027t swallow. Her throat had seized up. As she bolted to her feet, she spat the contents of her mouth onto the floor and a cry spiraled out: \"Ha on! Harmon, get up this minute!\"\n Harmon wasn\u0027t fast enough for her. He found himself being grabbed by both ankles and hauled out of bed. \"You crazy?\" he yelped.\n \"Whatzamatter \"He\u0027s a killer!\" Hannah\u0027s hair, which had a will of its own, had burst free from the shower cap. Her hair went wild, her mouth rimmed with ice cream foam. \"I knew something\u0027was wrong with him I knew it when I seen him he killed a man in Shreveport got that tattoo on Ins arm fifteen thousand dollars reward Hear me?\"\n \"Huh?\" Harmon said.\n Hannah grasped him by the collar of his red-checked pajamas.\n \"Fifteen thousand dollars!\" she shrieked into his face. \"By God, we\u0027re gonna get us that money! Now, stand up and put your clothes on!\"\n As Harmon pulled on his pants and Hannah struggled into her shapeless shift, she managed to drill the story through his thick skull. Harmon\u0027s face blanched, his fingers working his shirt buttons into the wrong holes. He started for the telephone. \"I\u0027ll go call the law right n-\" A viselike hand clamped to his shoulder. \"You listen to me!\" she thundered. \"You want to throw that money out the window? You think the cops won\u0027t cheat us outta every damn penny, you\u0027re dumber than a post! We\u0027re gonna catch him and take him in ourselves!\"\n \"But ... Hannah ... he\u0027s a killer!\"\n \u0027.He ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 but a big al\u0027 frog!\" she glowered, her hands on her stocky hips. \"\u0027Cept his legs are worth fifteen thousand dollars, and you and me are gonna take him to market! So you just shut up and do what I say! Understand?\"\n Harmon shut up, his thin shoulders bowed under the redheaded pressure. Hannah left the room, and Harmon heard her rummaging around in the hallway\u0027s closet.\n Harmon got his ring of keys from the bureau and hooked them around a belt loop, his fingers trembling. When he looked up, Hannah was holding the double-barreled shotgun that was their protection against burglars. He said, \"That gun\u0027s so old, I don\u0027t know if it\u0027ll even-\"\n She squelched him with a stare that would freeze time. Hannah also held a box of shells; there were five inside, and she loaded the shotiun and then pushed the other three shells into a pocket.\n \"We gotta got him out in the open,\" she said. \"Get him outside where he can\u0027t get to his guns.\"\n We ought to call the law, Hannah! Jesus, I think I\u0027m \u0027bout to heave!\"\n \"Do it later!\" she snarled. \"He might be a crazy killer, but I don\u0027t know many men who can do much killin\u0027 when they\u0027ve got their legs blowed off! Now, you just do what I say and we\u0027ll be rich as Midas!\"\n She snapped the shotgan\u0027s breech shut, slid her feet into her rubber flipflops, and stalked toward the front door. \"Come on, damn it!\" she ordered when she realized Harmon wasn\u0027t following, and he came slinking after her as pale as death.\n Mysterious Ways In Number Four, Dan checked his watch and saw it was time to go.\n He\u0027d swallowed two aspirin and laid down for a while, then had put on clean underwear and socks and the pair of blue jeans from his duffel bag. Now he stood before the bathroom\u0027s dark-streaked mirror, wetting his comb and slicking his hair back. He put on his baseball cap and studied his face with its deep lines and jutting cheekbones.\n Susan wasn\u0027t going to recognize him. He was afraid again, the same kind of pawing fear as when he\u0027d walked into the bank. More than likely, this was the last time he would ever see his son. He hoped he could find the words he needed.\n First things first: getting to Basile Park without being stopped by the police. Dan halted the duffel bag over his shoulder, picked up the cottage\u0027s key, and opened the front door into the humid night. The frogs had quieted except for a few low burps. Dan went to hit the wall switch to turn off the ceiling\u0027s bulb when he heard a metallic clink from the direction of his pickup truck, and he realized with a jolt that someone was standing there at the light\u0027s edge, watching him.\n Dan whipped his head toward the sound. \"Hey, hey!\" a man said nervously. It was Harmon DeCayne, sweat sparkling on his cheeks. He lifted his hands to show the palms.\n \"Don\u0027t do nothin\u0027 rash, now!\"\n \"You scared the hell out of me! What\u0027re you doin\u0027 here?\"\n \"Nothin\u0027l I mean to say ... I saw the lights.\" He kept his hands upraised. \"Thought you might need something\u0027.\"\n \"I\u0027m pullin\u0027 out,\" Dan said, his nerves still jangling. \"I was gonna stop at your house and leave the key on the porch.\"\n \"Where you headin\u0027? It\u0027s awful late to be on the road, don\u0027t you think?\"\n \"No, I\u0027ve got places to go.\" He advanced on DeCayne, intending to stow his duffel bag in the rear of the truck, and the other man retreated, that clinking noise coming from the key ring that Dan saw was fixed to one of DeCayne\u0027s belt loops. Dan abruptly stopped. His radars had gone up. He smelled a snake coiled in its hole. \"You all right?\"\n \"Sure I\u0027m all right! Why wouldn\u0027t I be all right?\"\n Dan watched the man\u0027s eyes; they were glassy with fear.\n He knows, Dan thought. Somehow, he knows. \"Here\u0027s the key,\" he said, and he held it out.\n \"Okay. Sure. That\u0027s ri-\" Dan saw DeCayne\u0027s eyes dart at something behind him.\n The woman, Dan realized. He had the mental image of a meat cleaver coming at him.\n He set himself and whirled around, bringing the duffel bag off his shoulder in a swinging blow.\n BOOM! went a gun seemingly right in his face. He felt the heat and the shock wave and suddenly the burning rags of the duffel bag were ripped from his hands and the fiery shreds of his clothes were flying out of it like luminous bats Hannah DeCayne Marred backward holding a shotgun with smolm [email protected] from the breech. Dan had an instant to register that the duffel bag had absorbed a point-blank [email protected], and then the woman righted herself and a holler burst from her sweat-shining face. Dan saw the shotgun leveled at his\n [email protected]\n /* */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t\u003ddocument.currentScript||function(){for(t\u003ddocument.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027),e\u003dt.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\u0027data-cfhash\u0027))return t[e]}();if(t\u0026\u0026(c\u003dt.previousSibling)){p\u003dt.parentNode;if(a\u003dc.getAttribute(\u0027data-cfemail\u0027)){for(e\u003d\u0027\u0027,r\u003d\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(0,2)|0,n\u003d2;a.length-n;n+\u003d2)e+\u003d\u0027%\u0027+(\u00270\u0027+(\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* */\n He jumped away from its dark double eyes a heartbeat before a gout of fire spewed forth and he landed on his belly in the weeds. His ears were ringing, but over that tintinnabulation he heard a wet smack and the c?ump of buckshot hitmw metal. He scrambled into the woods that lay alongside the cottage, his mind shocked loose of everything but the need to run like hell.\n Behind Dan, Harmon DeCayne was watching his shirt turn red. The impact had lifted him up and slammed him back against the pickup truck, but he was still on his feet. He pressed his hands against his stomach, and the blood ran between his fingers. He stared, blinking rapidly, through the haze of smoke that swirled between him and his wife.\n \"Now you\u0027ve done it,\" he said, and it amazed him that his voice was so calm. He couldn\u0027t feel any pain yet; from his stomach to his groin was as cold as January.\n Hannah gasped with horror. She hadn\u0027t meant to fire the first time; she\u0027d meant to lay the barrels up against the killer\u0027s skull, but his bag had hit the gun and her finger had twitched. The second time she\u0027d been aiming to take him down before he could rush her. Harmon kept staring at her as his knees began to buckle. And then the rage overcame Hannah\u0027s shock and she bellowed, \"I told you to get out of the way! Didn\u0027t you hear what I told your\u0027 Harmon\u0027s knees hit the ground.\n He swallowed thiddy, the taste of blood in his mouth. \"Shot me,\" he rasped. \"You ...\n damn bitch. Shot me.\"\n \"It\u0027s not my fault! I told you to move! You stupid ass, I told you to move!\"\n \"Ahhhhhh,\" Harmon groaned as the first real pain tore at his tattered guts. Blood was pooling in the dust below him.\n Hannah turned toward the woods, her face made even uglier by its rubber-lipped contortion. \u0027You ain\u0027t getting\u0027 away!\" she yelled into the dart She popped the shotgun open and reloaded both barrels. \"You think I\u0027m lattin\u0027 fifteen thousand dollars get away in my woods, you\u0027re crazy!\n You hear me, Mr. Killer?\"\n Dan heard her. He was lying on his stomach in the underbrush and stubbly palmettos forty feet from where the woman was standing. He\u0027d seen Harmon fall to his knees, had seen the woman reloading her shotgun. Now he watched as Hannah walked to her husband\u0027s side.\n She looked down at Harmon\u0027s damp, agownd face. \"You mess up every damn thing,\" she said coldly, and then she lifted the shotgun and fired a shell into the pickup\u0027s left front tire. The tire exploded with a whoosh of air and the pickup lurched @ a poleaxed horse. Dan almost cried out, but he clasped a hand over his mouth to prevent it.\n \"You ain\u0027t goin\u0027 nowhere in your truck!\" Hannah shouted toward the woods. \"You might as well come on out!\" Dan still wore his baseball cap, beads of sweat coming to his face. AD his, other clothes were blown to rags, his metallic-mist Chevrolet pickup crippled, his hopes of getting to Basile Park blown to pieces, too. The red-haired witch held the shotgun at hip level, its barrels aimed in his direction. \"Come on out, Mr. Killer!\" she yelled. Beside her, Harmon was still on his knees, his hands pressed to the wet mess of his midsection and his head drooping. \"All right then!\" she said. \"I can play\n [email protected]\n /* */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t\u003ddocument.currentScript||function(){for(t\u003ddocument.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027),e\u003dt.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\u0027data-cfhash\u0027))return t[e]}();if(t\u0026\u0026(c\u003dt.previousSibling)){p\u003dt.parentNode;if(a\u003dc.getAttribute(\u0027data-cfemail\u0027)){for(e\u003d\u0027\u0027,r\u003d\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(0,2)|0,n\u003d2;a.length-n;n+\u003d2)e+\u003d\u0027%\u0027+(\u00270\u0027+(\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* */\n if you want to, and first chance I get I\u0027ll blow your damn brains outt\" She suddenly began swidng into the woods almost directly toward where Dan was stretched out.

He had neither the quick legs nor the balance of his youth. All he cared about at the moment was putting distance between himself and a shotgun shen.\n And then he smelled oily stapance and his shoes splashed into water. Mud bogged him down. It was the hill pond.\n \"You wanna go swimmin\u0027?\" Hannah shouted from behind him.\n Dan couldn\u0027t see how large the pond was, but he knew he didn\u0027t din try to get across it. The woman would shoot him whUe he was knee-deep in muck. He backed out of the water to firmer earth and set off again through weeds and brush that edged the pond. No longer could he hear the woman following him, and it leapt through his mind that she knew these woods and might be bunkered down somewhere ahead. He pushed through a tangle of vines. Up beyond the canopy of pines and willow trees he caught sight of a few stars, as distant as Basile Park seemed to be. And then he entered a stand of waist-high weeds and he walked right into the arms of the figure that stood in front of him.\n In that instant he probably gained a dozen or so new gray hairs.\n He came close to wetting his pants. But he swung at the figure\u0027s head and pain shot through his imuckles when he connected with its jaw. The figure toppled over, and it was then that Dan realized it was a plaster mannequin.\n He stood over it, wringing his bruised hand. He could make out two more mannequins nearby as if frozen in hushed conversation, their clothes weatherbeaten @.\n Dark shapes lay before him,.but he was able to discern what seemed to be a carousel half covered with kudzu. He had stumbled into Harmon DeCayne\u0027s fairyland.\n He went on, past the rotting facade of a miniature castle.\n There was a broken-down Conestoga wagon and a couple of rusted car hulks. Bricks were underfoot, and Dan figured this was supposed to have been the main street of an enchanted village. Other mannequins dressed as cowboys and Indisanq stood about, the citizens of DeCayne\u0027s imagination. Dan moved past a huge tattered fabric shape with rotting wooden ribs that he thought might have been Jonah\u0027s whale, and suddenly he was looking at a high mesh fence topped with barbed wire that marked the edge of DeCayne\u0027s propertyI can climb the fence, he decided. The barbs\u0027fl be tough, but they\u0027ll be kinder than that dsimn shotgun. Once I get over, I canCan what? he asked himself. Without my truck I\u0027m not getting\u0027 very far.\n But there was another set of wheels close by, wasn\u0027t there?\n The station wagon parked next to the [email protected] house.\n He remembered the key ring on Harmon\u0027s belt loop.\n Would the station wagon\u0027s key be on it? Would the car even run?\n It had to; how else did they get their froglegs to market?\n But to get the key ring he would have to double back through the woods and avoid the woman, and that was a tall and dangerous order.\n He stood there for a moment, his hands grasping the fence\u0027s mesh.\n Beyond the fence was just more dark woods.\n If he had any hope of getting to Basile Park, he would have to go back for the key ring.\n Dan let go of the fence. He drew a deep breath and released it.\n His head was hurting again, but the ringing in his ears had . He turned away from the fence and started back the way he\u0027d come, creeping slowly and carefully, his senses questing for sound or motion.\n A on ed mannequin wearing a crown or tiara of some kind-a deformed fairy princess-stood on his right in the high weeds as he neared Jonah\u0027s whale. And suddenly Dan caught a sinuous movement from the corner of his eye, over beside a crumbling structure festooned with kudzu. He was ah-eady diving into the weeds as the shotgun boomed, and a split second later the princess\u0027s head and neck exploded in a shower of plaster. He lay on his side, breathing hard. \"Got you, didn\u0027t I?\"\n Hannah shouted. \"I know I winged you that time!\"\n He heard the shotgun snap open and then shut again. The woman was striding toward him, her flipflops maidng a smacking noise on the bricks. Dan felt what seemed to be a length of pipe next to his shoulder. He reached out and touched cold fingers. It was the princess\u0027s missing arm.\n He picked it up and rose to his feet. There was Hannah DeCayne, ten feet in front of him, the shotglm aimed just to his left. He flung the plaster arm at her, saw it pinwheel around and slam into her collarbone, and she bellowed with pain and fell on her rump, the shotgun going off into the air.\n Then Dan tore away through the weeds with the speed of desperation, leaving the woman cursing at his back.\n He found the pond again, and ran along its boggy edge. In another few minutes he pushed out of the underbrush twenty yuds away from his lamed pickup truck Harmon DeCayne was still in the same position, kneeling with his head bowed and his hands clasping his bloody middle.\n Dan leaned over the man and grasped the ring.\n DeCayne\u0027s eyes were closed, his breathing ghastly. Dan pulled the keys loose, and suddenly DeCayne\u0027s eyes opened and he lifted his head, blood leaking from the corner of his mouth.\n \"HannahT\u0027 DeCayne gasped.\n \"Be still,\" Dan told him. \"Which key starts the station wagonri \"Don\u0027t ... don\u0027t hurt me.\"\n \"I\u0027m not gonna hurt you.

Reaching the station wagon, Dan opened the door on its groaning hinges and slid behind the wheel. The inside of the car smelled like the it-og pond.\n He tried to jam a key into the ignition, but it refused. The next key balked as well. He saw a blurred movement, and by the house lights made out Hannah DeCayne runwng toward him on the road, her hair flying behind her, her sweating face a nctus of rage.
