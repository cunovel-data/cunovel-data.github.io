He was facing a slim, bucktoothed gent who must\u0027ve stood six-four, his dark hair cut as if a bowl had been placed on his head as a guide for the ragged scissors. \"You got a vacancy?\"\n The man, who wore blue jeans and a black Hawm\u003dprint shirt with orange flowers on it, gave a snorty @.\n \"Nothin\u0027 but,\" he said. \"Come on in and we\u0027ll fix you up.\"\n Dan followed the man up a set of creaky stairs onto the porch. He was aware of a deep, slow rumbling noise on the sultry air\u0027, frogs, he thought it must be. Sounded like hundreds of them, not very far away.\n Dan went into the house behind the man, who walked to a desk in the dingy little front room and brought out a Nifty notebook and a ballpoint Pen. \"AMghty,\" the man said, offering a grin that could\u0027ve popped a bottle top. \"Now we\u0027re ready to do some bidness.\" He opened the notebook, which Dan saw was a repstmtion log that held only a few @bbled names. \"I\u0027m Harmon DeCayne, glad you decided to stop over with us.\"\n \"Dan Farrow.\" They shook hands. DeCayne\u0027s palm felt oily.\n \"How many nights, Mr. FarrowT\u0027 t\u0027imt one. @9 I\u0027m YOU from?\"\n \"Baton Rouge,\" he decided to say.\n \"Well, you\u0027re a long way from home\n [email protected]\n /* */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t\u003ddocument.currentScript||function(){for(t\u003ddocument.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027),e\u003dt.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\u0027data-cfhash\u0027))return t[e]}();if(t\u0026\u0026(c\u003dt.previousSibling)){p\u003dt.parentNode;if(a\u003dc.getAttribute(\u0027data-cfemail\u0027)){for(e\u003d\u0027\u0027,r\u003d\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(0,2)|0,n\u003d2;a.length-n;n+\u003d2)e+\u003d\u0027%\u0027+(\u00270\u0027+(\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* */\n , @\u0027t your, DeCayne wrote down the fake information. He seemed so excited, his hand was trembling. \"We got some nice cottages, real nice and comftable.\"\n \"That\u0027s good.\" Dan hoped the cottages were cooler than the house, which might\u0027ve served as a steam bath. A small fan on a scarred coffee table was chattering, obviously overmatched. \u0027How much?\" He reached for his wallet.\n \"Uh-\" DeCayne paused, his narrow brow \"Does six dolim suit you?\"\n \"Seven\n Paid in advance, if you please.\"\n DeCayne jumped. The woman\u0027s voice had been a high, nasty whiplash. She had come through a corridor that led to the rear of the house, and she stood watching Dan with small, dark eyes.\n \"Seven [email protected],\" she repeated. \"We don\u0027t take no checks or plgmtic.09 \"My wife,\" DeCayne said; his grin had expired. \"Hannah. \"\n She had red hair that flowed over her [email protected] shoulden in a torrent of @ curls. Her face was about as as a chunk of limestone, all sharp edges and forbidding angles. She wore a shapeless lavender-colored shift and rubber flipflops, and she stood maybe five feet tall, her body compact and vnde-tupped and her legs @ white tree . She was holding a meat cleaver, her fingers ghstemng with blood.\n \"Seven dollars it is,\" Dan agreed, and he paid the man.\n The money went into a metal tin that was instantly locked by one of the keys on a key ring attached to DeCaynes belt.\n Hannah DeCayne said, \"Give him Number Four. It\u0027s cimimt.pl \"Yes, bon.\" De Cayne plucked the proper key from a wan plaque where six other keys were hangm \"Get him a fan,\" she instructed her husband. He opened a closet and brought out a fan similar to the one that fought the steam currents. \"A pffla, too.\"\n \"Yes, bon.\" He leaned into the closet again and emerged with a bare prow. He gave Dan a nervous smile that didn\u0027t do much to hide a glint of pain in his eyes. \"Nice and comftable cottage, Number Four is.\"\n \"Does it have a phone?\" Dan asked.\n \"Phone\u0027s right here,\" the woman said, and she motioned with the meat cleaver toward a telephone on a table in the corner. \"Local calls cost fifty cents.\"\n \"Are Alexandria numbers long distance?\"\n \"We ain\u0027t in Alexandria. Cost you a dollar a minute.\"\n And she\u0027d time him to the second, too, he figured. He couldn\u0027t call Susan with this harpy listening over his shoulder. \"Is there a pay phone around anywhere?\"\n \"One at the gas station couple of miles up the road,\" she said.\n \"If it\u0027s workin\u0027.\"\u0027 Dan nodded. He stared at the cleaver in the woman\u0027s fist.\n \"Been choppin\u0027 some meat?\"\n \"Froglegs,\" she said.\n \"Oh.\" He nodded again, as if this made perfect sense.\n \"That\u0027s what we live on,\" she continued, and her lower lip curled.\n \"Ain\u0027t no money in this damn place. We sell froglegs to a restaurant in town. Come out of the pond back that way.\" She motioned with the cleaver again, toward the rear of the house. Dan saw jewels of blood on the blade. \"What\u0027d you say your name was?\"\n \"Farrow. Dan Farrow.\"\n \"Uh-huh. Well, Mr. Farrow, you ever seen a cockeyed fool before?\" She didn\u0027t wait for an answer. \"There\u0027s one, standin\u0027 right beside you. Ever heard of a cockeyed fool buyin\u0027 a damn motel on the edge of a swamp pond? And then puttin\u0027 every damn penny into a damn fairyland?\"\n \"Han?\" Harmon\u0027s voice was very quiet. \"Please.\"\n \"Please, my ass,\" she hissed. \"I thought we was gonna be makin\u0027 some money by now, but no, I gotta damn fool for a husband and I\u0027m up to my elbows in froglegs!\"\n \"I\u0027ll show you to your cottage.\" Harmon started for the door.\n \"Watch where you step!\" Hannah DeCayne warned Dan.\n \"Damn frogs are breedin\u0027 back in that pond. There\u0027s hundreds of \u0027em \u0027round here. Show our guest the fairyland while you\u0027re at it, why don\u0027tcha?\" This last statement had been hurled at her husband like a bucketful of battery acid.\n He ducked his shoulders and got out of the house, and Dan darted another glance at the woman\u0027s meat cleaver before he followed.\n \"Enjoy your stay,\" she said as he went through the door.\n Holding the fan and the pillow, Harmon climbed into the pickup truck and Dan got behind the wheel. Harmon made a slight nasal whistling sound as he breathed, kind of Mo a steam kettle on a slow boil. \"Number Four\u0027s up that rind,\" he said with an upward jerk of his chin. \"Turn right.\"\n Dan did. \"Woman\u0027s always on me,\" Harmon said bitterly.\n \"So I messed up, so what? Ain\u0027t the @ first man in the world to mess up. Won\u0027t be the last neither.\"\n \"That\u0027s true,\" Dan agreed.\n \"It\u0027s that way.\" Harmon motioned to a weed-grown pathway meandering off into the woods.\n What is? The cottage?\"\n \"No. The fairyland. There\u0027s your cottage up road.\"\n The headlights showed a dismal-looking green-daubed dump waiting ahead, but at least the roof appeared sturdy.\n Also revealed by the headlights was a squattage of frogs, maybe two dozen or more, on the dirt road between Dan\u0027s truck and the cottage. Dan hit the brake, but Harmon said, \"Hell, run \u0027em over, I don\u0027t give a damn.\"\n Dan tried to ease through them. Some squawked and leapt for safety, but others seemed hypnotized by the lights and met their maker in a flattened condition. Dan parked in front of the cottage and followed DeCayne inside, the noise of the frogs a low, throbbing rumble.\n He hadn\u0027t expected much, so he wasn\u0027t disappointed. The cottage smelled of mildew and Lysol, and the pent-up heat inside stole the breath from his lungs. DeCayne turned on the lights and plugged in the fan, which made a rackrting sound as if its blades were about to come loose and fly apart.\n The bed\u0027s mattress had no sheet, and none was offered. Dan checked the bathroom and found two fist-size frogs croaking on the shower tiles. DeCayne scooped them up and tossed them out the back door. Then he presented the key to Dan.\n \"Checkout time\u0027s twelve noon. \u0027Course, we\u0027re not expectin\u0027 a rush, so you can take your time.\"\n \"I\u0027ll be leavin\u0027 early anyway-\" \"Okay.\" He\u0027d already put the pillowcase on the pillow and directed the fan\u0027s sullen breeze toward the bed. \"You need anythin\u0027 else?\"\n \"Not that I can think of.\" Dan didn\u0027t plan to steep here; he was going to bide his time for a few hours and then call Susan from the gas station\u0027s pay phone. He walked outside with DeCayne and got his duffel bag from the truck.\n \"Hannah\u0027s right about watchin\u0027where you step,\" the man said.\n \"They can make an awful mess. And if you find any more in the cottage, just pitch \u0027em out back.\" DeCayne looked toward his own house, which stood fifty yards or so away, the lights just visible through the woods. \"Well, I\u0027d better get on back. You married, Mr. Farrow?\"\n \"Used to be.\"\n \"I knew you were a free man. Got the look of freedom about you.\n I swear, sometimes I\u0027d give anythin\u0027 to be free.\"\n \"All it takes is a judge.\"\n DeCayne grunted. \"And let her steal me blind? Oh, she laughs at me and calls me a fool, but someday I\u0027ll show her.\n Yessir. I\u0027ll fix up the fairyland the way it oughta be and the tourists\u0027ll come from miles around. You know, I bought all that stuff for a song.\"\n That stuff \" \"In the fairyland. The statues and stuff. It\u0027s all in there: Cinderella\u0027s castle, Hansel and Gretel, the whale that swallowed Jonah. All they need is patchin\u0027 and paint, they\u0027ll be like new.\"\n Dan nodded. It was obvious the man had constructed some kind of half-baked tourist attraction along that weeded-up pathway, and obvious too that the tourists had failed to arrive.\n \"One of these days I\u0027ll show her who\u0027s a fool and who\u0027s smart,\"\n DeCayne muttered, mostly to himself. He sighed resignedly. \"Well, hope you have a good night\u0027s sleep.\" He began walking back to his house, frogs jumping around his shoes.\n Dan carried his duffel bag into the cottage. In the bathroom he found a sliver of soap on the sink, and he removed his baseball cap and damp shirt and washed his face and hands with cool water. He was careful to get rid of the last traces of blood between his fingers and under his nails. Then he took a wet piece of toilet paper outside and cleaned the pickup\u0027s steering wheel. When he returned to the cottage, he discovered in the bedside table\u0027s drawer a six-month-old Newsweek magazine with Saddam Hussein\u0027s face on the cover. Beneath the magazine was the more useful discovery of a deck of cards. He sat down on the bed, leaning back against the plastic headboard, and he took off his wristwatch and laid it beside him. It was twelve minutes after nine; he\u0027d decided that he\u0027d go make the call at eleven o\u0027clock.\n He dealt himself a hand of solitaire, the first of many, and he tried with little success to get Blanchard\u0027s dying face out of his mind. In a couple of hours he might either see Chad or be in the back of a police car heading for jail. Was it worth the risk? He thought it was. For now, though, all he could do was wait and play out the cards before him. The wristwatch\u0027s second hand was moving, and the future would not be denied.\n Meet the Pelvis As Dan had been driving away from Reverend Gwinn\u0027s house, a black 1978 Cadillac Eldorado with a broken right headlight and a crumpled passenger door turned into the parking lot of the Old Plantation Motel \u0027near Shreveport\u0027s regional airport.\n In the sultry twilight gloom, the place looked as if Sherman had already passed through. Flint Murtaugh guided his car past a rusted cannon that defiantly faced the north. A tattered Confederate flag drooped on its warped pole. The motel\u0027s office was constructed to resemble a miniature plantation manor, but the rest of the place was definitely meant for the slaves. Trash floated on the brown surface of the swimming pool\u0027s water, and two men sat sharing a bottle beside an old Lincoln up on cinder blocks.\n Flint stopped his car before the door marked twenty-three and got out. Beneath Flint\u0027s shirt, Clint twitched in an uneasy sleep. Flint heard a man\u0027s and woman\u0027s voices tangled in argument through an open door, cursing each other purple. Beer cans and garbage littered the parched grass. Flint thought that the South wasn\u0027t what it used to be.\n He knocked on the door of number twenty-three. A dog began barking from within, a high-pitched yap yap yap yap.\n \"It\u0027s all right, Mama,\" he heard a man say.\n That voice. Familiar, wasn\u0027t it?\n A latch clicked. The door opened a few inches before the chain stopped it.\n Flint was looking at a slice of pudgy face and a sapphireblue eye.\n An oily comma of dark brown hair hung down over the man\u0027s forehead.\n \"Yes sir?\" that deep, slightly raspy, oh-so-familiar voice asked as the dog continued to yap in the background.\n \"I\u0027m Flint Murtaugh. Smoates sent me.\"\n \"Oh, yessir! Come on in!\" The man took the chain off, opened the door wider, and Flint caught his breath with a startled gasp.\n Standing before him, wearing a pair of black pants and a red shirt with a wide, tall collar and silver spangles on the shoulders, was a man who had died fourteen years before.\n \"Don\u0027t mind Mama,\" Elvis Presley said with a nervous grin. \"She\u0027s got a bark, but she don\u0027t have no bite.\"\n \"You\u0027re. . .\" No, of course it wasn\u0027t! \"Who the hell are you?\"\n \"Pelvis Eisley\u0027s the name.\" He offered a fleshy hand, the fingers of which were laden with gaudy fake diamond rings.\n Flint just looked at it, and the other man withdrew it after a few seconds as if fearful he\u0027d caused offense. \"Mama, get on back now!\n Give him some room! Come on in, pardon the mess!\"\n Flint crossed the threshold as if in a daze. Pelvis Eisleythe big-bellied, fat-jowled twin of Elvis Presley as he\u0027d been the year of his death at Graceland-closed the door, relocked it, and scooped up a grocery sack from the nearest chair. It was filled, Flint saw, with potato chip bags, boxes of doughnuts, and other junk food. \"There you go, Mr. Murtaugh, you can set yourself right here.\"\n \"This is a joke, isn\u0027t it?\" Flint asked.\n \"Sir?\"\n A spring jabbed his butt, and only then did Flint realize he\u0027d sat down in the chair. \"This has got to be a-\" Before he could finish, a little barking thing covered with brownand-white splotches leapt onto his lap, its wet pug nose mashed flat and its eyes bulbous. It began yapping in his face.\n Meet the Pelvis \"Mama!\" Pelvis scolded. \"You mind your manners!\" He lifted the bulldog off Flint and put her down, but the animal was instantly up on Flint\u0027s lap again.\n \"I reckon she likes you,\" Pelvis said, smiling an Elvis sneer.\n \"I ... hate ... dogs,\" Flint replied in his chill whisper.\n \"Get it off me. Now.\n \"Lordy, Mama!\" Pelvis picked the dog up and held her against his jiggling belly while the animal continued to bark and struggle. \"Don\u0027t everbody in this world enjoy your shenanigans, you hear? Hold still!\"\n The dog\u0027s thrashings made Flint think of a Slinky. Its watery eyes remained fixed on him as he used his handkerchief to brush the dog hairs from the knees of his pants.\n \"You want something\u0027to drink, Mr. Murtaugh? How \u0027bout some buttermilk?\"\n \"No. \" The very smell of buttermilk made him deathly ill.\n \"Got some pickled pig\u0027s feet, if you want a bite to-\" \"Eisley,\"\n Flint interrupted, \"how much did that bastard pay you?\"\n \"sir?9t \"Smoates. How much did he pay you to pull this joke on me?\" !\n Pelvis frowned. He and the struggling dog wore the same expression. \"I don\u0027t believe I know what you mean, sir.\"\n \"Okay, it was a good joke! See, I\u0027m laughin\u0027!\" Flint stood up, his face grim. He glanced around the cramped little room and saw that Eisley\u0027s living habits were the equivalent of buttermilk and pickled pig\u0027s feet. On one wall a large poster of Elvis Presley had been thumb-tacked up; it was the dangerous, cat-sneer face of the young Elvis before Las Vegas stole the Memphis from his soul. On a table was a beggar\u0027s banquet of cheap plaster Elvis statues and busts; a cardboard replica of Graceland; a framed photograph of Elvis standing with his gloomy, hollow-eyed mother, and a dozen other Elvis knickknacks and geegaws that Flint found utterly repugnant. Another wall held a black velvet portrait of Elvis and Jesus playing games on the steps of what was presumably heaven. Flint felt nauseated. \"How can you stand to live in all this crap?\"\n Pelvis looked stunned for a few seconds. Then his grin flooded back. \"Oh, now you\u0027re joshin\u0027 me!\" The dog got away from him and slipped to the floor, then leapt up onto the bed amid empty Oreo and Chips Ahoy coolde bags and started yapping again.\n \"Listen, I\u0027ve got a job to do, so I\u0027ll just say fare thee well and get out.\" Flint started for the door.\n \"Mr. Smoates said you and me was gonna be partners,\" Pelvis said with a hurt whine. \"Said you was gonna teach me eveethin\u0027 you knew.\"\n Flint stopped with his hand on the latch.\n \"Said you and me was gonna track a skin together,\" Pelvis went on.\n \"Hush, Mama!\"\n Flint wheeled around, his face bleached to the shade of the white streak in his hair. \"You mean ... you\u0027re tellin\u0027 me ... this is not a joke?\"\n \"No sir. I mean, yes sir. Mr. Smoates from the office to get me, \u0027cause that\u0027s where the phone is.\n Mr. Smoates said you was on your way, and we was gonna track a skin together. Uh ... is that the same as being\u0027 a bounty hunter?\"\n Pelvis took the other man\u0027s shocked silence as agreement. \"See, that\u0027s what I w:anna be. I took a detective course by mail from one of thera magazines. I was livin\u0027 in Vicksburg then. [email protected] who runs a detective agency in Vicksburg said he didn\u0027t have a job for me, but he told me all about Mr. Smoates. Like how Mr. Smoates was always on the lookout @or-let\u0027s see, how\u0027d he put it?-special talent, I think he said. Anyhow, I come from Vicksburg to see Mr.\n Smoates and we had us a talk this afternoon. He said for me to hang \u0027round town a few days, maybe he\u0027d give me a tryout. So I guess this is what this is, huh?\"\n \"You\u0027ve got to be insane,\" Flint rasped.\n Pelvis kept grinning. \"Been called worse, I reckon.\"\n Flint shook his head. The walls seemed to be closing in on him, and on all sides there was an Elvis. The dog was yapping, the noise splitting his skull. The awful stench of Fella come Meet the Pelyls buttermilk wafted in the air. Something close to panic grabbed Flint around the throat. He whirled toward the door, wrenched the latch back, and leapt out of the foul Elvisized room. As he ran along the breezeway toward the office with Clint twitching under his shirt, he heard the nightmare calling behind him: \"Mr. Murtaugh, sir? You all right?\"\n In the office, where a Confederate flag was nailed to the wall next to an oil portrait of Robert E. Lee, Flint all but attacked the pay phone. \"Hey, careful there!\" the manager warned. He wore blue jeans, a Monster Truck T-shirt, and a Rebel cap. \"That\u0027s motel property!\"\n Flint shoved a quarter into the slot and punched Smoates\u0027s home number. After four rings Smoates answered- \"Yeah?\"\n \"I\u0027m not goin\u0027 out with that big shit sack!\" Flint sputtered.\n \"No way in Hell!\"\n \"Ha,\" Smoates said.\n \"You tryin\u0027 to be funny, or what?\"\n \"Take it easy, Flint. What\u0027s ratin, you? \"You know what, damn it! That Eisley! Hell, he thinks he\u0027s Elvis! I\u0027m a professional! I\u0027m not goin\u0027 on the road with somebody who belongs in an asylum!\"\n \"Eisley\u0027s sane as you or me. He\u0027s one of them Elvis impersonators.\" Smoates let out a laugh that so inflamed Flint, he almost jerked the phone off the wall. \"Looks just like him, don\u0027t he?\"\n \"Yeah, he looks like a big shit sack!\"\n \"Hey!\" Smoates\u0027s voice had taken on a chill. \"I was a fan of Elvis\u0027s. Drilled my first piece of pussy with \u0027Jailhouse Rock\u0027 playin\u0027 on the radio, so watch your mouth!\"\n \"I can\u0027t believe you\u0027d even think about hirin\u0027him on! He\u0027r, as green as grass! Did you know he took a detective course by mail?\"\n \"Uh-huh. That puts him ahead of where you were when I hired you.\n And as I recall, you were pretty green yourself.\n Billy Lee raised hell about havin\u0027 to take you out your first time.\"\n \"Maybe so, but I didn\u0027t look like a damn fool!\"\n \"Flint,\" Smoates said, \"I like the way he looks. That\u0027s why I want to give him a chance.\"\n \"Are you crazy, or am I?\"\n \"I hire people I think can get the job done. I hired you cause I figured you were the kind of man who could get on a skin\u0027s track and not let loose no matter what. I figured a man with three arms was gonna have to be tough, and he was gonna have something\u0027 to prove, too.\n And I was right about that, wasn\u0027t I? Well, I\u0027ve got the same feelin\u0027 about Eisley. A man who walks and talks and looks like Elvis Presley\u0027s gotta have a lot of guts, and he\u0027s already been down a damn hard road.\n So you ain\u0027t the one to be sittin\u0027 in judgment of him and what he can or can\u0027t do. Hear?\"\n \"I can\u0027t stand being\u0027 around him! He makes me so nervous I can\u0027t think straight!\"\n \"Is that so? Well, that\u0027s just what Billy Lee said about you, as I remember. Now, cut out the bellyachin\u0027 and you and Eisley get on your way. Call me when you get to Alexandria.\"\n Flint opened his mouth to protest again, but he realized he would be speaking to a deaf ear because Smoates had already hung up. \"Shit!\"\n Flint seethed as he slammed the receiver back onto its hook.\n \"Watch your language there!\" the manager said. \"I run a refined place!\" Flint shot him a glance that might\u0027ve felled the walls of Fort Sumter, and wisely the manager spoke no more.\n At Number Twenty-three Flint had to wait for Eisley to unlock the door again. The heat hung on him like a heavy cloak, anger churning in his constricted belly. He understood the discomfort of pregnancy, only he had carried this particular child every day of his thirty-three years. Inside the room, the little bulldog barked around Flint\u0027s shoes but was smart enough not to get in range of a kick. \"You okay, Mr.\n Murtaugh?\" Eisley asked, and the dumb innocence of vis-voice was the match that ignited Flint\u0027s powder kegHe grasped Eisley\u0027s collar with both hands and slammed his bulk up against the Elvis poster. \"Ouch,\" Pelvis said, showing a scared grin. \"That ldnda smarted.\"\n \"I @ you,\" Flint said icily. \"I dislike you, your hair, your clothes, your dead fat hillbilly, and your damn ugly dog.\" He heard the mutt growling and felt it plucking at his trouser leg, but his anger was focused on Eisley. \"I believe I\u0027ve never met anybody I dislike worse. And Clint doesn*t care for you worth a shit, either.\" He let go of Pelvws conu to unhook a button. \"Clintl Out!\" Ms brother\u0027s hand and arm slid it-re @ a shin white serpent. The fingers found Pelvis\u0027s face and began to explore his features. Pelvis made a noise @ a squashed frog. \"You know what you are to mer, Flint asked. \"Dirt.\n if you get under my feet, I\u0027ll step on you.\n Got it?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gone-south/page-7.html","bookId":2479,"book":{"id":2479,"title":"Gone South","description":"Storyline: \n Flooded by memories, poisoned by Agent Orange, Dan Lambert kills a man in a moment of fear and fury -- and changes his life forever.
