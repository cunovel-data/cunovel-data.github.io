{"id":31698,"no":9,"title":"VIII ARDEA\u0027S SOLDIER","content":"In years long gone by, soldiers called \"knights\" used to protect the rights of other people; and, when the weak were in danger, these soldiers went forth to fight for them. They were so brave, these knights of old, that there was nothing that could make them afraid. Dragons even, which looked like crocodiles, with leather wings and terrible snatching claws and fiery eyes and breath that smoked—dragons, even, so the stories go, could not turn a knight away from his path of duty. Mind, I am not telling you that there ever were creatures that looked like that; but certain it is that there were dangers dreadful to meet, and \"dragon\" is a very good name to call them by. You know, do you not, that there are soldiers, still, who protect the rights of others; and although we do not commonly call them \"knights,\" they still fight for the weak, and are so brave that dangers as fearsome as dragons, even, cannot scare them. There was such a soldier in Ardea\u0027s camp; and if he had lived in olden days, he would probably have been called \"Knight of the Snowy Heron.\" Ardea was a bride that spring, and perhaps never was[Pg 122] there one much lovelier. Her wedding garment was the purest white; and instead of a veil she wore, draped from her shoulders, snowy plumes of rare beauty, which reached to the bottom of her gown, where the dainty tips curled up a bit, then hung like the finest fringe. She wore, draped from her shoulders, snowy plumes of rare beauty. She wore, draped from her shoulders, snowy plumes of rare beauty. The Soldier watched her as she stood alone at the edge of the water, so small and white and slender against the great cypress trees bearded with Spanish moss, and thought she made a picture he could never forget. And when her mate came out to her, in a white wedding-robe like her own, with its filmy cape of mist-fine plumes,[Pg 123] Ardea\u0027s Soldier smiled gently, for he loved Heron Camp and shared, in his heart, the joys of their home-coming. Ardea and her mate took a pleasant trip, looking for a building place at the edge of a swamp. They did not object to neighbors; which was fortunate, as there were so many other herons in the camp that it would have been hard to find a very secret spot for their nest. After looking it over and talking about it a bit, they chose a mangrove bush for their very own. They had never built a house before, but they wasted no time in hunting for a carpenter or teacher, but went to work with a will, just as if they knew how. It was like playing a game of \"five-six, pick up sticks\"; only they did not lay them straight but in a scraggly criss-cross sort of platform, with big twigs twelve inches long at the bottom and smaller ones on top. Then, when it looked all ready for a nice soft lining, Ardea laid an egg right on the rough sticks. Rather lazy and shiftless, don\u0027t you think? or maybe they didn\u0027t know any better, poor young things who had never had a home before! Ah, but there was another pair of snowy herons building in the bush next door, and they didn\u0027t put in anything soft for their eggs, either; and six or eight bushes farther on, a little blue heron was already sitting on her blue eggs in almost exactly the same sort of nest. So that is the kind of carpenters herons are! Sticks[Pg 124] laid tangled up in a mass is the way they build! Yes, that is all—just some old dead twigs. I mean that is all you could see; but never think for a minute that there wasn\u0027t something else about that nest; for Ardea and her mate had lined it well with love, and so it was, indeed, a home worth building. Near Ardea\u0027s Home. Near Ardea\u0027s Home. In less than a week there were four eggs beneath the white down comforter that Ardea tucked over them;[Pg 125] and the little mother was as well pleased as if she had had five, like her neighbors, the other snowy heron and the little blue heron. If the eggs of the little blue heron were blue, would not those of the snowy herons be pure white? No, the color of eggs does not need to match the color of feathers; and Ardea\u0027s eggs and those of her next-bush neighbor were so much like the beautiful blue ones of the little blue heron, that it would be very hard for you to tell one from the other. Perhaps Ardea could not have told her own eggs if she had not remembered where she had built her nest. As it was, she made no mistake, but snuggled cosily over her pretty eggs, doubling up her long slender black legs and her yellow feet as best she could. If she found it hard to sit there day after day, she made no fuss about it; and probably she really wanted to do that more than anything else just then, since the quiet patience of the most active birds is natural to them when they are brooding their unhatched babies. Then, too, there was her beautiful mate for company and help; for when Ardea needed to leave the nest for food and a change, the father-bird kept house as carefully as need be. To her next-bush neighbors and the little blue herons Ardea paid no attention, unless, indeed, one of them[Pg 126] chanced to come near her own mangrove bush. Then she and her mate would raise the feathers on the top of their heads until they looked rather fierce and bristly, and spread out their filmy capes of dainty plumes in a threatening way. That criss-cross pile of old dead twigs was a dear home after all, being lined, you will remember, with the love of Ardea and her mate; and they both guarded it as well as they were able. At last the quiet brooding days came to an end, and four funny little herons wobbled about in Ardea\u0027s nest. Their long legs and toes stuck out in all directions, and they couldn\u0027t seem to help sprawling around. If there had been string or strands of moss or grass in the nest, they would probably have got all tangled up. As it was, they sometimes nearly spilled out, and saved themselves only by clinging to the firm sticks and twigs. So it would seem that their home was a good sort for the needs of their early life, just as it was; and no doubt a heron\u0027s nest for a heron is as suitable a building as an oriole\u0027s is for an oriole.[Pg 127] That criss-cross pile of old dead twigs was a dear home, and they both guarded it. That criss-cross pile of old dead twigs was a dear home, and they both guarded it. [Pg 128] It would take some time before the babies of Ardea would be able to straighten up on their long, slim legs and go wading. Until that day came, their father and mother would have to feed them well and often. Now the marsh where the snowy herons went fishing, where the shallow water was a favorite swimming-place for little fishes, was ten miles or more from their nest. Some kinds of herons, perhaps most kinds, are quiet and stately when they hunt, standing still and waiting for their game to come to them, or moving very slowly and carefully. But Ardea and the other snowy herons ran about in a lively way, spying out the little fishes with their bright yellow eyes, and catching them up quickly in their black beaks. After swallowing a supply of food, Ardea took wing and returned across the miles to her young. Standing on the edge of her nest and reaching down with her long neck, she took the bill of one of her babies in her own mouth, and dropped part of what she had swallowed out of her big throat down into his small one. When she had fed her babies and preened her pretty feathers a bit, she was off again on the ten-mile flight; for many a long journey she and her mate must take ere their little ones could feed themselves. But ten miles over and over and over again were as nothing to the love she had for her children; and faithfully as she had brooded her eggs, she now began the task of providing their meals. She seemed so happy each time she returned, that perhaps she was a little bit worried while she was away; but there is no reason to think she really was afraid that any great harm could come to them. Certainly she was unprepared for what she found when she flew back from her fourth fishing trip. Even[Pg 129] when she reached Heron Camp, she did not understand. There are some things it is not given the mind of a bird to know. She could not know, poor dear, that there were people in the world who coveted her beautiful wedding plumes. Women there were, who wished to make themselves look better by wearing the feathers that Nature had given snowy herons for their very own. And men there were, who thought to make themselves grander in the dress of their organization by walking about with heron plumes waving on their heads. The two kinds of white herons with wonderful plumes that have been put to such uses are called Egrets and Snowy Egrets, and the feathers, when they are stripped from the birds, are called by the French name of aigrette. Now, of course, Ardea could not know about this, or that the Plume-Hunters had come to steal her wedding feathers. But she knew well enough that danger was at hand, and that in times of trouble a mother\u0027s place is beside her babies. Her heart beat quickly with a new terror, but she stayed, the brave bird stayed! And all about her the other herons stayed also. They had no way to fight for their lives, and they might have flown far and safely on their strong wings; but none of them would desert the home built with love while the frightened babies were calling to their fathers and mothers.[Pg 130] No, they could not fight for their lives, but there was one who could. For danger did not come to Heron Camp without finding Ardea\u0027s Soldier at his post. Now the Plume-Hunters did not have bodies like crocodiles and leather wings, you know; but they were dragons of a sort, for all that, for they carried brutal things in their hands that belched forth smoke and pain and death, and they were cruel of heart, and they had sold themselves to do evil for the sake of the dollars that covetous men and women would pay them for feathers. Dragons though they were, Ardea\u0027s Soldier met them bravely. I like to think how brave he was; for was not the fight he fought a fight for our good old Mother Earth, that she might not lose those beautiful children of hers? If the world should be robbed of Snowy Herons, it would be just so much less lovely, just so much less wonderful. And have they no right to life, since the same Power that gave life to men gave life to them? And when we think about it this way, who seems to have the better right to those plumes—herons, or men and women? The Soldier believed in Ardea\u0027s right to life, believed in it so deeply that he stood alone before the Plume-Hunters and told them that, while he lived, the birds of his camp should also live. And that is why they killed him—the dragons who[Pg 131] were cruel of heart and had sold themselves to do evil for the sake of dollars that covetous men and women would pay for feathers. Because of his courage and because of the cause for which he died, I think, don\u0027t you, that Ardea\u0027s Soldier might well be called \"Knight of the Snowy Heron.\" I said that he was alone, and it is true that no one was there at the camp to help him. But many there were in other places doing their bit in the same good fight. Another soldier, named Theodore Roosevelt, did much for these birds when he was President, by granting them land where no man had a right to touch them; for it makes a true soldier angry when the weak are oppressed, and he said, \"It is a disgrace to America that we should permit the sale of aigrettes.\" Another man, named Woodrow Wilson, whose courage also was so great that he always did what he believed to be right, would not permit, when he was Governor of New Jersey, a company to sell aigrettes in that State; he said, \"I think New Jersey can get along without blood-money.\" Many another great man, besides, served the cause of Ardea. So many, in fact, that there is not room here to tell about them all. But there is room to say that the children helped. For, you know, every Junior Audubon Society sends money to the National Association of[Pg 132] Audubon Societies—not much, but a little; and when the Knight of the Snowy Heron was killed, that little helped the National Association to hire another soldier to take his place. Now, think of that! There was another soldier who so believed in the Herons\u0027 right to life and plumage, that he was ready to protect them though it meant certain danger to himself! Yes, there is to this very day a soldier at Heron Camp. Do you know a way to keep him safe? Why, you children of America can do it if you will, and it need not cost one of you a penny. You can do it with your minds. For if every girl makes up her mind for good and all that she will never wear a feather that costs a bird its life; and if every boy makes up his mind for good and all that he will never be a feather-hunting dragon—why there will not be anybody growing up in America to harm Ardea, will there? You can keep the Soldier of Heron Camp safe by just wishing it! That sounds wonderful as a fairy story come true, does it not? And like the knight in some old fairy tale, could not Ardea\u0027s new Soldier \"live happily forever after\"? \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3337/91297.html","bookId":354,"book":{"id":354,"title":"Bird Stories","description":"简介： Right in the very heart of Christmas-tree Land there was a forest of firs that pointed to the sky as straight as steeples.
