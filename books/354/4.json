{"id":31693,"no":4,"title":"III PETER PIPER","content":"One was named Sandy, because Sandy is a Scotch name and there were blue-bells growing on the rocks; so it seemed right that one of them should have a Scotch name, and what could be better, after all, than Sandy for a sandpiper? One was named Pan, because he piped sweetly among the reeds by the river. One, who came out of his eggshell before his brothers, was named Peter, for his father. But Mother Piper never called her children Sandy and Pan and Peter. She called them all \"Pete.\" She was so used to calling her mate \"Pete,\" that that name was easier than any other for her to say. The three of them played by the river all day long. Each amused himself in his own way and did not bother his brothers, although they did not stray too far apart to talk to one another. This they did by saying, \"Peep,\" now and then. About once an hour, and sometimes oftener, Mother Piper came flying over from Faraway Island, crying, \"Pete, Pete, Pete,\" as if she were worried. It is no wonder that she was anxious about Sandy and Peter and Pan, for, to begin with, she had had four fine children,[Pg 34] and the very first night they were out of their nest, the darlings, a terrible prowling animal named Tom or Tabby had killed one of her babies. One was named Peter, for his father. One was named Peter, for his father. But Peter and Pan and Sandy were too young to know much about being afraid. So they played by the river all day long, care-free and happy. Their sweet[Pg 35] little voices sounded contented as they said, \"Peep,\" one to another. Their queer little tails looked frisky as they went bob-bob-bob-bing up and down every time they stepped, and sometimes when they didn\u0027t. Their dear little heads went forward and back in a merry sort of jerk. There were so many things to do, and every one of them a pleasure! Oh! here was Sandy clambering up the rocky bank, so steep that there was roothold only for the blue-bells, with stems so slender that one name for them is \"hair-bell.\" But Sandy did not fall. He tripped lightly up and about, with sure feet; and where the walking was too hard, he fluttered his wings and flew to an easier place. Once he reached the top of the bank, where the wild roses were blossoming. And wherever he went, and wherever he came, he found good tasty insects to eat; so he had picnic-luncheons all along the way. Ho! here was Pan wandering where the river lapped the rocky shore. His long slender legs were just right for wading, and his toes felt comfortable in the cool water. There was a pleasing scent from the sweet-gale bushes, which grew almost near enough to the river to go wading, too; and there was a spicy smell when he brushed against the mint, which wore its blossoms in pale purple tufts just above the leaves along the stem. And every now and then, whether he looked at the top of the water or[Pg 36] at the rocks on the shore-edge, he found tempting bits of insect game to eat as he waded along. Oho! here was Peter on an island as big as an umbrella, with a scooped-out place at one side as deep as the hollow in the palm of a man\u0027s hand. This was shaped exactly right for Peter\u0027s bathtub, and as luck would have it, it was filled to the brim with water. Such a cool splashing—once, twice, thrice, with a long delightful flutter; and then out into the warm sunshine, where the feathers could be puffed out and dried! These were the very first real feathers he had ever had, and he hadn\u0027t had them very long; and my, oh, my! but it was fun running his beak among them, and fixing them all fine, like a grown-up bird. And when he was bathed and dried, there was a snack to eat near by floating toward him on the water. Oh! Ho! and Oho! it was a day to be gay in, with so many new amusements wherever three brave, fearless little sandpipers might stray. Then came sundown; and in the pleasant twilight Peter and Pan and Sandy somehow found themselves near each other on the bank, still walking forth so brave and bold, and yet each close enough to his brothers to hear a \"Peep,\" were it ever so softly whispered. Did it just happen that about that time Mother Piper came flying low over the water from Faraway Island to[Pg 37] Nearby Island, calling, \"Pete, Pete, Pete,\" in a different tone, a sort of sundown voice? Was that the way to speak to three big, \u0027most-grown-up sandpiper sons, who had wandered about so free of will the livelong day? Ah, but where were the \u0027most-grown-up sons? Gone with the sun at sundown; and, instead, there were three cosy little birds, with their heads still rumpled over with down that was not yet pushed off the ends of their real feathers, and a tassel of down still dangling from the tip of each funny tail. And three dear, sweet, little voices answered, \"Peep,\" every time Mother Piper called, \"Pete\"; and three little sons tagged obediently after her as she called them from place to place all round and all about Nearby Island, teaching them, perhaps, to make sure there was no Tabby and no Tommy on their camping-ground. So it was that, after twilight, when darkness was at hand and the curfew sounded for human children to be at home, Peter and Pan and Sandy settled down near each other and near Mother Piper for the night. And where was Peter Piper, who had been abroad the day long, paying little attention to his family? He, too, at nightfall, had come flying low from Faraway Island; and now, with his head tucked behind his wing, was asleep not a rod away from Mother Piper and their three sons.[Pg 38] Somehow it was very pleasant to know that they were near together through the starlight—the five of them who had wandered forth alone by sunlight. But not for long was the snug little Nearby Island to serve for a night camp. Mother Piper had other plans. Like the wise person she was, she let her children find out many things for themselves, though she kept in touch with them from time to time during the day, to satisfy herself that they were safe. And at night she found that they were willing enough to mind what they were told to do, never seeming to bother their heads over the fact that every now and then she led them to a strange camp-ground. So they did not seem surprised or troubled when, one night soon, Mother Piper, instead of calling them to Nearby Island, as had been her wont, rested patiently in plain sight on a stump near the shore and, with never a word, waited for the sunset hour to reach the time of dusk. Then she flew to the log where Peter Piper had been teetering up and down, and what she said to him I do not know. But a minute later, back she flew, this time rather high overhead, and swooped down toward the little ones with a quick \"Pete-weet.\" After her came Peter Piper flying, also rather high overhead, and swooping down toward his young. Then Mother and Peter Piper went in low, slow flight to Faraway Island.[Pg 39] Were they saying good-night to their babies? Were their sons to be left on the bank by themselves, now that they had shaken the last fringe of down from their tails and lost the fluff from their heads? Did they need no older company, now that they looked like grown-up sandpipers except that their vests had no big polka dots splashed over them? Ah, no! At Mother Piper\u0027s \"Pete-weet,\" Peter answered, \"Peep,\" lifted his wings, and flew right past Nearby Island and landed on a rock on Faraway Island. And, \"Peep,\" called Sandy, fluttering after. And, \"Peep,\" said Pan, stopping himself in the midst of his teetering, and flying over Nearby Island on his way to the new camp-ground. That is how it happened that they had their last luncheon on the shore of Faraway Island before snuggling down to sleep that night. One of the haunts of Peter and Pan and Sandy was Cardinal-Flower Path. This lovely place was along the marshy shore not far from Nearby Island. It was almost white with the fine blooms of water-parsnip, an interesting plant from the top of its blossom head to the lowest of its queer under-water leaves. And here and there, among the lacy white, a stalk of a different sort grew, with red blossoms of a shade so rich that it is called the cardinal flower. Every now and then a ruby-throated[Pg 40] hummingbird darted quickly above the water-parsnips straight to the cardinal throat of the other flower, and found refreshment served in frail blossom-ware of the glorious color he loved best of all. And it would be well for all children of men to know that, although three bright active children of sandpipers ran teetering about Cardinal-Flower Path many and many a day, the place was as lovely to look upon at sundown as at sunrise, for not one wonderful spray had been broken from its stem. So it happened, because the children who played there were Sandy and Peter and Pan, that the cardinal flowers lived their life as it was given them by Nature, serving refreshments for hummingbirds through the summer day, and setting seeds according to their kind for other cardinal flowers and other hummingbirds another year. But even the charms of Cardinal-Flower Path did not hold Pan and Peter and Sandy many weeks. They seemed to be a sort of gypsy folk, with the love of wandering in their hearts; and it is pleasant to know that, as soon as they were grown enough, there was nothing to prevent their journeying forth with Peter and Mother Piper. Of all the strange and wonderful plants and birds and insects they met upon the way I cannot tell you, for, in all my life, I have not traveled so far as these three children[Pg 41] went long before they were one year old. They went, in fact, way to the land where the insects live that are so hard and beautiful and gemlike that people sometimes use them for jewels. These are called \"Brazilian beetles,\" and you can tell by that name where the Pipers spent the winter, though it may seem a very far way for a young bird to go, with neither train nor boat to give him a lift. Not even tired they were, from all accounts, those little feather-folk; and why, indeed, should they be tired? A jaunt from a northern country to Brazil was not too much for a healthy bird, with its sure breath and pure rich blood. There was food enough along the trail—they chose their route wisely enough for that, you may be sure; and they were in no great haste either going or coming. \"Coming,\" did I say? Why, surely! You didn\u0027t think those sandpipers stayed in Brazil? What did they care for green gem-like beetles, after all? The only decorations they ever wore were big dark polka dots on their vests. Perhaps they were all pleased with them, when their old travel-worn feathers dropped out and new ones came in. Who can tell? They had a way of running their bills through their plumage after a bath, as if they liked to comb their pretty feathers. Be that as it may, there was something beneath their[Pg 42] feathers that quickened like the heart of a journeying gypsy when, with nodding heads and teetering tails, they started again for the north. Did they dream of a bank where the blue-bells grew, and a shore spiced with the fragrance of wild mint? No one will ever know just how Nature whispers to the bird, \"Northward ho!\" But we know they come in the springtime, and right glad are we to hear their voices. So Peter Piper, Junior, came back again to the shore of Nearby Island. And do you think Sandy and Pan walked behind him for company, calling, \"Peep,\" one to another? And do you think Mother Piper and Father Peter showed him the way to Faraway Island at sun-down, and guarded him o\u0027 nights? Not they! They were busy, every one, with their own affairs, and Peter would just have to get along without them. Well, Peter could—Peter and Dot. For of course he was a grown-up sandpiper now, with a mate of his own, nodding her wise little head the livelong day, and teetering for joy all over the rocks where the red columbine grew.[Pg 43] The spot she teetered to most of all. The spot she teetered to most of all. [Pg 44] The spot she teetered to most of all was a little cup-shaped hollow high up on the border of the ledge, where the sumachs were big as small trees and where the sweet fern scented the air. The hollow was lined tidily and softly with dried grass, and made a comfortable place to sit, no doubt. At least, Dot liked it; and Peter must have had some fondness for it, too, for he slipped on when Dot was not there herself. It just fitted their little bodies, and there were four eggs in it of which any sandpiper might well have been proud; for they were much, much bigger than most birds the size of Dot could ever lay. In fact, her little body could hardly have covered them snugly enough to keep them warm if they had not been packed just so, with the pointed ends pushed down into the middle of the rather deep nest. The eggs were creamy white, with brown spots splashed over them—the proper sort of eggs (if only they had been smaller) to tuck beneath a warm breast decorated with pretty polka dots. But still, they must have been her very own, or Dot could not have taken such good care of them. Because of this care, day by day the little body inside each shell grew from the wonderful single cell it started life with, to a many-celled creature, all fitted out with lungs and a heart and rich warm blood, and very slender legs, and very dear heads with very bright eyes, and all the other parts it takes to make a bird. When the birds were all made, they broke the shells and pushed aside the pieces. And four more capable little rascals never were hatched.[Pg 45] Why, almost before one would think they had had time to dry their down and stretch their legs and get used to being outside of shells instead of inside, those little babies walked way to the edge of the river, and from that time forth never needed their nest. And look! the fluffy, cunning little dears are nodding their heads and teetering their tails! Yes, that proves that they must be sandpipers, even if we did have doubts of those eggs. Ah! Dot knew what she was about all along. The size of her eggs might fool a person, but she had not worried. Why, indeed, should she be troubled? Those big shells had held food-material enough, so that her young, when hatched, were so strong and well-developed that they could go wandering forth at once. They did not lie huddled in their nest, helplessly begging Peter Piper and Mother Dot to bring them food. Not they! Out they toddled, teetering along the shore, having picnics from the first—the little gypsy babies! Tabby did not catch any of them, though one night she tried, and gave Dot an awful scare. It was while they were still tiny enough to be tucked under their mother\u0027s feathers after sundown, and before they could manage to get, stone by stone, to Nearby Island. So they were camped on the shore, and the prowling cat came very near. So near, in fact, that Mother Dot[Pg 46] fluttered away from her young, calling back to them, in a language they understood, to scatter a bit, and then lie so still that not even the green eyes of the cat could see a motion. The four little Pipers obeyed. Not one of them questioned, \"Why, Mother?\" or whined, \"I don\u0027t want to,\" or whimpered, \"I\u0027m frightened,\" or boasted, \"Pooh, there\u0027s nothing here.\" Dot led the crouching enemy away by fluttering as if she had a broken wing, and she called for help with all the agony of her mother-love. \"Pete,\" she cried, \"Pete,\" and \"Pete, Pete, Pete!\" No one who hears the wail of a frightened sandpiper begging protection for her young can sit unmoved. Someone at the Ledge House heard Dot, and gave a low whistle and a quick command. Then there was a dashing rush through the bushes, that sounded as if a dog were chasing a cat. A few minutes later Dot\u0027s voice again called in the dark—this time, not in anguish of heart, but very cosily and gently. \"Pete-weet?\" she whispered; and four precious little babies murmured, \"Peep,\" as they snuggled close to the spotted breast of their mother. So it happened that two sons and two daughters of Peter Piper, Junior, played and picnicked and bathed by the river. The one who had first pipped his eggshell was named Peter the Third, for his father and his grandfather,[Pg 47] and a finer young sandpiper never shook the fluff of down from his head or the fringe from his tail, when his real feathers pushed into their places. What his brother and sisters were named, I never knew; and it didn\u0027t matter much, for their mother called them all \"Pete.\" Dallying happily along the river-edge. Dallying happily along the river-edge. Peter the Third and the others grew up as Pan and Peter and Sandy had grown, dallying happily along the river-edge, and as happily accepting the guidance of their mother, who made her slow flight from Faraway[Pg 48] Island every now and then, usually so low that her spotted breast was reflected in the clear water as she came, the white markings in her wings showing above and below. Of course, as soon as the season came for their migration journey, the four of them started cheerfully off with Peter and Dot, for a leisurely little flight to Brazil and back—to fill the days, as it were, with pleasant wanderings, from the time the hummingbird fed at the feast of the cardinal flower in late summer, until he should be hovering over the columbine in the spring. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3337/91292.html","bookId":354,"book":{"id":354,"title":"Bird Stories","description":"简介： Right in the very heart of Christmas-tree Land there was a forest of firs that pointed to the sky as straight as steeples.
