I accept my fate.” Adina handed the bronzer to Miss Montana, who singsonged “Awesome!” and promised to share with her teammates as long as they didn’t all use the brush and get it bacterified, which would give them pimples.\n “Teen Dreamers, I am very proud of us. You’ve given us the Department of Teen Dreamland Security. Personally, I know I will sleep better tonight knowing this is here. If anything tries to mess with us, we will show it that Miss Teen Dreamers mean business.”\n “What’s your weapon?” Adina pressed.\n Taylor cocked her head as if she had just asked the stupidest question in the world. “I am my own weapon, Miss New Hampshire.”\n “Ready!” Petra shouted.\n The girls stopped what they were doing and went to help Petra with the banner she’d been sewing for many days. “All right, Miss Teen Dreamers. Let’s get that banner a-wavin’ proud like the red, white, and blue!” Shanti balanced on Jennifer’s shoulders, and Adina sat on Nicole’s. They tied the corners to the limbs of two scraggly trees.\n “How does it look?” Shanti called down.\n Petra’s needlework was evident in the carefully crafted letters: IT’S MISS TEEN DREAM, BITCHES!\n Petra stepped back to examine it. She smiled. “Perfect.”\n COMMERCIAL BREAK\n VOICEOVER\n This Tuesday, on PATRIOT DAUGHTERS!\n (A group of British soldiers bursts into the home of BETSY ROSS, surrounding her and her reading circle of comely young women.)\n VO, CONT’D.\n Has time finally run out for Betsy and her revolutionary band of sisters?\n BRITISH COMMANDER\n Miss Ross, we are to arrest you for treason. You give these rebels a symbol through your sewing, I hear. What say you to these charges?\n (Betsy sheds her dressing gown. Underneath, she wears stockings and a skimpy undershirt. The other women follow suit.)\n BETSY ROSS\n How could I make a flag, sir, when I seem to have run out of thread?\n VO, CONT’D.\n She gave it all for her country — and then she gave just a little more.\n Watch the show critics say “makes American history totally hot… . It takes some of the most important women of the Revolutionary War and turns them into hellcats who fight the British with everything they’ve got — and then some.”\n Followed by the season premiere of CAPTAINS BODACIOUS IV: BADDER AND MORE BODACIOUSER.\n (Several hunky, shirtless young men in breeches, earrings, and very little else stand on a large ship. There seems to be a feeling of mutiny in the air.)\n PIRATE CHU\n Cor blimey, Cap’n Sinjin! We ran away from prep school for this?\n CAPTAIN SINJIN\n Might I remind you that we witnessed a murder and were forced to go on the run? Believe me, I’d rather be studying for my chem final than running from barmy terrorist blokes who want to kill us just because we know too much.\n PIRATE AHMED\n Captain! Starboard — look!\n (Captain Sinjin puts a small telescope to his eye. When he pulls it away, his expression is one of teen heartthrob alarm. His hair is still perfect.)\n CAPTAIN SINJIN\n Gentlemen, we may get a battle yet.\n FIRST MATE GEORGE\n Should we oil our pecs, sir, so that we’ll look fantastic during the fight scenes?\n CAPTAIN SINJIN\n Indeed. Gentlemen! Glisten up those pecs! And if you’ve got any hair gel for making tousled waves, now’s the time to use it! We stand and fight. But we stand and fight with hotness on our side.\n VOICEOVER\n PATRIOT DAUGHTERS. Tuesdays at 8. CAPTAINS BODACIOUS IV: BADDER AND MORE BODACIOUSER at 9.
