Nicole snickered. “That’s better.” With a grunt, she tossed the vine toward Shanti’s one free hand and dug in her heels. “Grab on.” But Shanti was panicked. She tugged sharply. “Hey! Don’t pull too hard! You’ll —” Nicole lost her balance and toppled into the quicksand. She made a desperate grab for the vine, but it fell in with them. “Nice work, Bollywood.” “Oh my God. Why didn’t you secure it to the tree first?” “You’re welcome, Miss Grabby Hands. Aren’t you the science whiz? Don’t you know about forces and equal and opposite reaction and all that?” “Like, hello? I was being swallowed by quicksand, okay?” Shanti shrieked. “Well, now we’re both stuck.” The girls screamed as loudly as they could, but no one heard or no one came. Shanti gave a rueful laugh. “Don’t you know the other trope?” “What’s that?” “The brown people die first.” The girls struggled in the mud, fighting the pull as it sucked them farther down no matter what they did. Despite being unable to move, both Shanti and Nicole managed to free their hands for one last, sisters-in-non-white-dominant-culture-solidarity hand clasp. It was a very cool hand clasp, the kind white kids across America will try to emulate in about six months, just before an avant-garde white pop starlet turns it into a hit single and makes lots of money. “You can’t … trust … the man,” Nicole said with her last breath, as she and Shanti sank beneath the quicksand.

Princess Priya, an Academy Award-winning movie about an orphan girl from India’s slums who is rescued from a life of poverty and exploitation by a well-meaning white woman (Best Actress Oscar for Victoria Bollocks). CHAPTER SEVENTEEN The surface of the quicksand bubbled. Nicole’s face pushed through. She spit out the oatmeal-like sludge and took a deep breath. “Shanti!” she gasped. “Shanti, I’ve got hold of a root! We’re saved.” Two seconds later, Shanti’s head emerged. “Nicole! Nicole, I found a root! I can pull us out!” “Shanti? Where are you?” “Over here! Sorry, I can’t see yet. Can’t wipe my eyes.” “Me either. Can you pull yourself out?” Nicole asked. “Totally.” “Go!” With a grunt, they heaved their way up the vine and onto solid land. They were covered in muck, but they were alive. This narrow escape made them giddy. They hugged and held on tightly to each other. “Ohmigosh, that is going to be, like, the best story ever for the judges!” Shanti shook the clingy mud from her hands. Nicole did the same. “Just so you know, I wouldn’t have let you drown before.” “I know,” Shanti said, and they hugged again. They found a steaming hot spring, and once they had tested it to be sure it wasn’t more quicksand, they eased themselves in. The banks of the hot spring were made of thick, red clay. Shanti scooped up a handful and put it on her face. “This stuff is, like, genius for your complexion. Want some?” Nicole smeared the mud on her face. “Too bad there’s nothing for my hair.” “What do you mean?” Shanti could feel the clay hardening, closing her pores. “I am a black woman without her products. All this new growth? I will never get a brush through this again,” Nicole said with a sigh. “It looks so awesome! Like a kinky waterfall.” “Did you just say kinky waterfall like it was a compliment?” “You should keep it natural.” “Yeah?” Nicole patted her hair. It was coarse but full. “Need some kind of grease, though.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-queens/page-67.html","bookId":2717,"book":{"id":2717,"title":"Beauty Queens","description":"Storyline: When a plane crash strands thirteen teen beauty contestants on a mysterious island, they struggle to survive, to get along with one another, to combat the island\u0027s other diabolical occupants, and to learn their dance numbers in case they are rescued in time for the competition.Written by Libba Bray, the hilarious, sensational, Printz Award-winning author of A Great and Terrible Beauty and Going Bovine.
