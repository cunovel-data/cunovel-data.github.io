There are various forms of rum — dark, golden, white, spiced, aged, flavored — but they all share one distinctive quality: They will get you drunk. And if you’ve spent quite a bit of time on a deserted island eating coconut and grubs, rum will get you drunk rather quickly and thoroughly.42\\n\\n “Fifteen men on the dead man’s chest. Yo, ho, ho, and a bottle of freaking awesome!” Adina said in a loud voice. She slurred a bit so that awesome came out more like aweshumme. “I changed my mind. I don’t want to be an inveshtigative journalist anymore. I want to be a professional rum drinker.”\\n\\n “There are people who do that,” Duff said. He’d barely sipped his rum.\\n\\n “Really? What do you call them?”\\n\\n “Alcoholics.”\\n\\n “Good to know. Three little maids from school are we…” sang Adina. “My dads took me to see The Pirates of Penzance last year in New York. That song goes very fast. It’s a pit … a potter … pas …”\\n\\n “Patter song?”\\n\\n “That.” Adina took another swig.\\n\\n “Speaking of fast, you might want to slow down on that grog a bit, matey.”\\n\\n Duff went for the bottle, but Adina yanked it away, spilling some in the process. “That is an example of a man being paternalishtic with a woman.”\\n\\n Duff shrugged. “Or it could be an example of a friend who really doesn’t want to clean puke from your hair later.”\\n\\n “You would clean puke from my hair?”\\n\\n “Well, it wouldn’t be my preferred activity, but I would.”\\n\\n “Awww. That … is so romantic. Still. My body, my bottle.”\\n\\n “Whatever you say, captain.”\\n\\n The bottle was passed to Shanti, who shook her head. “I’m total straightedge.”\\n\\n She passed it on to Nicole, who took a whiff and made a face. “Yikes. I’m pretty sure I could clean a wound with that.” She shoved the bottle at Captain Sinjin, who dabbed some behind his ears like aftershave and then threaded a stale block of marshmallow onto a stick for Petra.\\n\\n The captain had been watching Petra all night, Nicole noticed. “I need to get something from my hut. Shanti, will you come with me?” She flicked a glance in Petra and Sinjin’s direction.\\n\\n “Sure,” Shanti said, picking up on the inference. “Party’s moving to our hut, everybody.”\\n\\n “Captain?” Duff asked.\\n\\n Sinjin glanced furtively at Petra. “Nah. Catch you blokes later.”\\n\\n Sinjin and Petra were alone.\\n\\n “So.”\\n\\n “So.”\\n\\n “Nice night.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-queens/page-86.html","bookId":2717,"book":{"id":2717,"title":"Beauty Queens","description":"Storyline: When a plane crash strands thirteen teen beauty contestants on a mysterious island, they struggle to survive, to get along with one another, to combat the island\u0027s other diabolical occupants, and to learn their dance numbers in case they are rescued in time for the competition.Written by Libba Bray, the hilarious, sensational, Printz Award-winning author of A Great and Terrible Beauty and Going Bovine.
