{"id":30114,"no":22,"title":"THE FOWLS ON PILGRIMAGE","content":"ONCE upon a time old Lady Fox was very hungry, but she had nothing to eat, and there was no sign of a dinner to be had anywhere. \"What shall I do, what shall I do?\" whined the Fox. \"I am so faint and hungry, but all the birds and all the fowls are afraid of me and will not venture near enough for me to consult them about a dinner. I have so bad a name that no one will trust me. What can I do to win back the respect of the community and earn a square meal? Ah, I have it! I will turn pious and go upon a pilgrimage. That ought to make me popular once more.\" So the Fox started upon the pilgrimage. She had not gone very far when she met a Cock, but he knew the character of Madame Fox too well to trust himself near. He flew up into a tree, and from that safe perch crowed jauntily, \"Good morning, Madame Fox. Whither away so fast?\" The Fox drew down the corners of her mouth, trying to look pious, and rolled up her eyes as she answered in a hollow voice, \"Oh, Master Cock, I am going on a pious pilgrimage. I am sorry for my wicked life, and now I am going to be good.\" \"Ah,\" said the Cock, \"I am indeed glad to hear that! Going on a pilgrimage, are you? Well, in that case I will go with you.\" \"Do, Master Cock, do,\" answered the Fox fervently. \"It will do you good. Come sit upon my broad back and I will carry you.\" The Cock thanked her and climbed upon her back, and so they proceeded on their pilgrimage together. After a while they came upon a Dove, which fluttered away hastily when she saw old Lady Fox, knowing too well her wicked tricks. But the Fox called to her in a gentle voice:— \"Do not be afraid, O Dove. I know why you start at my approach. But I have repented of my former sins and have turned pilgrim. My friend, the Cock, and I have just started upon our pious journey. Will you join us?\" When the innocent Dove saw the Cock upon the Fox\u0027s back she thought that certainly everything must be safe, so she answered:— \"Yes, Madame Fox, I will go with you.\" \"Jump right up on my back; there is plenty of room beside the Cock,\" said the Fox cordially. A little further on they met a wild Duck, who waddled away quacking wildly when he saw the Fox trotting towards him. But the sly old lady called out to him, smiling:— \"Be calm, little brother. I have given up my former unkind tricks, for which I sadly repent, and now I am going on a pious pilgrimage. See, your friends the Cock and the Dove are my companions.\" \"In that case I will go along, too,\" said the Duck, \"for you have a goodly party.\" \"That is right,\" replied the Fox approvingly. \"I thought you would go. Kindly take a back seat with the others.\" Now when these queer pilgrims had traveled for some time they came to a cave in the rocks, a deep dark cave which looked like a den. And here the Fox stopped, saying:— \"Dear brothers, it is time that we paused and thought more carefully about our sins. We must cross seas and rivers, and Heaven knows when we shall reach the end of our journey. Let us listen to one another\u0027s confessions, for I am sure we have all been miserable sinners. Come, Mr. Cock, come into the cave with me and I will hear you first.\" The Cock followed her into the cave, saying with some surprise, \"Why, Madame Fox, what have I done that is wicked?\" \"Do you not know?\" answered the Fox sternly. \"Why, do you not begin to crow at midnight and wake poor tired people out of their first sleep? Go to! You ought to be ashamed! Then again you crow at the most inconveniently early hour in the morning and make the caravans mistake the true time, so that they start upon their journeys long before the proper hour and fall into the hands of robbers who prowl about before light. These are dreadful sins, Mr. Cock, and you deserve to be punished.\" So the wicked old Fox seized the Cock and ate him all up. After the Fox had finished him she came to the entrance of the cave and called, \"Now you come, little Dove, and tell me what you have done that is naughty.\" \"But I have done nothing,\" said the innocent Dove, wondering very much; \"of what evil do you accuse me, Madame Fox?\" \"When the farmers sow their grain you dig up the yellow kernels and eat them for your dinner. That is stealing, which is a wicked, wicked sin, and must be severely punished,\" cried the hungry Fox. And thereupon she seized the poor little Dove and ate her up. Once more the Fox stood at the door of the cave, stealthily licking her chops, and she called out to the Duck, \"Come in, Mr. Duck, and I will hear what you have to say.\" \"Well, I have not done anything wrong,\" said the Duck positively, \"and you cannot say that I have; can you now, Madame Fox?\" \"Oh, indeed and indeed!\" exclaimed the Fox. \"Have you not stolen the king\u0027s gold crown, and do you not wear it on your head, you wicked creature?\" \"Indeed and indeed I have done no such thing. It is not true, Madame Fox, as I can prove. Wait a bit and I will bring witnesses.\" So the Duck went out and flew up and down in front of the cave, waiting. Presently along came a Hunter with a gun, who espied the Duck and aimed the weapon at him. \"Don\u0027t shoot me,\" cried the Duck. \"What have you against me, O Hunter? I can tell you where to find worthier game. Come with me and I will show you a wicked old Fox who eats innocent birds.\" \"Very well,\" said the Hunter, putting up his gun, \"show me the place and I will spare you.\" The Duck led him softly to the entrance of the cave, and pausing there cried out to the Fox inside, \"Come out, Madame Fox, I have brought the witness.\" \"Let him come in, let him come in!\" cried the Fox, for she had grown very hungry indeed and hoped for a double meal. \"No indeed,\" answered the Duck; \"he insists that you must come out.\" So the Fox crept stealthily to the door, but as soon as she popped out her wicked old head the Hunter was ready for her, and Bang! That was the end of the Fox\u0027s pilgrimage. The Duck also had had enough of being a pilgrim. He went home with the Hunter and became a tame Duck, and lived happily ever after on the pond near the Hunter\u0027s house. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3340/91366.html","bookId":351,"book":{"id":351,"title":"The Curious Book of Birds","description":"简介： There are many books written nowadays which will tell you about birds as folk of the twentieth century see them.
