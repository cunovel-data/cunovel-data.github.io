A Railway Diversion","content":"Chapters xxviii to xxxviii \\n\\n \\n\\n Our taking Wejh had the wished effect upon the Turks, who abandoned their advance towards Mecca for a passive defence of Medina and its Railway. Our experts made plans for attacking them. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Germans saw the danger of envelopment, and persuaded Enver to order the instant evacuation of Medina. Sir Archibald Murray begged us to put in a sustained attack to destroy the retreating enemy. \\n\\n \\n\\n Feisal was soon ready in his part: and I went off to Abdulla to get his co-operation. On the way I fell sick and while lying alone with empty hands was driven to think about the campaign. Thinking convinced me that our recent practice had been better than our theory. \\n\\n \\n\\n So on recovery I did little to the Railway, but went back to Wejh with novel ideas. I tried to make the others admit them, and adopt deployment as our ruling principle; and to put preaching even before fighting. They preferred the limited and direct objective of Medina. So I decided to slip off to Akaba by myself on test of my own theory. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1339/40244.html","bookId":56,"book":{"id":56,"title":"Seven Pillars of Wisdom","description":"简介： Seven Pillars of Wisdom is the autobiographical account of the experiences of British soldier T.
