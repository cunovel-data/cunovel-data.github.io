The general, who is deluded with the hopes of taking Troy without his assistance, but fears the army was discouraged by his absence, and the late plague, as well as by the length of time, contrives to make trial of their disposition by a stratagem. He first communicates his design to the princes in council, that he would propose a return to the soldiers, and that they should put a stop to them if the proposal was embraced. Then he assembles the whole host, and upon moving for a return to Greece, they unanimously agree to it, and run to prepare the ships. They are detained by the management of Ulysses, who chastises the insolence of Thersites. The assembly is recalled, several speeches made on the occasion, and at length the advice of Nestor followed, which was to make a general muster of the troops, and to divide them into their several nations, before they proceeded to battle. This gives occasion to the poet to enumerate all the forces of the Greeks and Trojans, and in a large catalogue. \\n\\n \\n\\n The time employed in this book consists not entirely of one day. The scene lies in the Grecian camp, and upon the sea-shore; towards the end it removes to Troy. \\n\\n Now pleasing sleep had seal\u0027d each mortal eye, \\n\\n Stretch\u0027d in the tents the Grecian leaders lie: \\n\\n The immortals slumber\u0027d on their thrones above; \\n\\n All, but the ever-wakeful eyes of Jove.76 \\n\\n To honour Thetis\u0027 son he bends his care, \\n\\n And plunge the Greeks in all the woes of war: \\n\\n Then bids an empty phantom rise to sight, \\n\\n And thus commands the vision of the night. \\n\\n \"Fly hence, deluding Dream! and light as air,77 \\n\\n To Agamemnon\u0027s ample tent repair. \\n\\n [pg 026] \\n\\n Bid him in arms draw forth the embattled train, \\n\\n Lead all his Grecians to the dusty plain. \\n\\n Declare, e\u0027en now \u0027tis given him to destroy \\n\\n The lofty towers of wide-extended Troy. \\n\\n For now no more the gods with fate contend, \\n\\n At Juno\u0027s suit the heavenly factions end. \\n\\n Destruction hangs o\u0027er yon devoted wall, \\n\\n And nodding Ilion waits the impending fall.\" \\n\\n Swift as the word the vain illusion fled, \\n\\n Descends, and hovers o\u0027er Atrides\u0027 head; \\n\\n Clothed in the figure of the Pylian sage, \\n\\n Renown\u0027d for wisdom, and revered for age: \\n\\n Around his temples spreads his golden wing, \\n\\n And thus the flattering dream deceives the king. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Canst thou, with all a monarch\u0027s cares oppress\u0027d, \\n\\n O Atreus\u0027 son! canst thou indulge the rest?78 \\n\\n Ill fits a chief who mighty nations guides, \\n\\n Directs in council, and in war presides, \\n\\n To whom its safety a whole people owes, \\n\\n To waste long nights in indolent repose.79 \\n\\n Monarch, awake! \u0027tis Jove\u0027s command I bear; \\n\\n Thou, and thy glory, claim his heavenly care. \\n\\n In just array draw forth the embattled train, \\n\\n Lead all thy Grecians to the dusty plain; \\n\\n [pg 027] \\n\\n E\u0027en now, O king! \u0027tis given thee to destroy \\n\\n The lofty towers of wide-extended Troy. \\n\\n For now no more the gods with fate contend, \\n\\n At Juno\u0027s suit the heavenly factions end. \\n\\n Destruction hangs o\u0027er yon devoted wall, \\n\\n And nodding Ilion waits the impending fall. \\n\\n Awake, but waking this advice approve, \\n\\n And trust the vision that descends from Jove.\" \\n\\n The phantom said; then vanish\u0027d from his sight, \\n\\n Resolves to air, and mixes with the night. \\n\\n A thousand schemes the monarch\u0027s mind employ; \\n\\n Elate in thought he sacks untaken Troy: \\n\\n Vain as he was, and to the future blind, \\n\\n Nor saw what Jove and secret fate design\u0027d, \\n\\n What mighty toils to either host remain, \\n\\n What scenes of grief, and numbers of the slain! \\n\\n Eager he rises, and in fancy hears \\n\\n The voice celestial murmuring in his ears. \\n\\n First on his limbs a slender vest he drew, \\n\\n Around him next the regal mantle threw, \\n\\n The embroider\u0027d sandals on his feet were tied; \\n\\n The starry falchion glitter\u0027d at his side; \\n\\n And last, his arm the massy sceptre loads, \\n\\n Unstain\u0027d, immortal, and the gift of gods. \\n\\n Now rosy Morn ascends the court of Jove, \\n\\n Lifts up her light, and opens day above. \\n\\n The king despatch\u0027d his heralds with commands \\n\\n To range the camp and summon all the bands: \\n\\n The gathering hosts the monarch\u0027s word obey; \\n\\n While to the fleet Atrides bends his way. \\n\\n In his black ship the Pylian prince he found; \\n\\n There calls a senate of the peers around: \\n\\n The assembly placed, the king of men express\u0027d \\n\\n The counsels labouring in his artful breast. \\n\\n \"Friends and confederates! with attentive ear \\n\\n Receive my words, and credit what you hear. \\n\\n Late as I slumber\u0027d in the shades of night, \\n\\n A dream divine appear\u0027d before my sight; \\n\\n Whose visionary form like Nestor came, \\n\\n The same in habit, and in mien the same.80 \\n\\n The heavenly phantom hover\u0027d o\u0027er my head, \\n\\n \u0027And, dost thou sleep, O Atreus\u0027 son? (he said) \\n\\n Ill fits a chief who mighty nations guides, \\n\\n Directs in council, and in war presides; \\n\\n To whom its safety a whole people owes, \\n\\n To waste long nights in indolent repose. \\n\\n [pg 028] \\n\\n Monarch, awake! \u0027tis Jove\u0027s command I bear, \\n\\n Thou and thy glory claim his heavenly care. \\n\\n In just array draw forth the embattled train, \\n\\n And lead the Grecians to the dusty plain; \\n\\n E\u0027en now, O king! \u0027tis given thee to destroy \\n\\n The lofty towers of wide-extended Troy. \\n\\n For now no more the gods with fate contend, \\n\\n At Juno\u0027s suit the heavenly factions end. \\n\\n Destruction hangs o\u0027er yon devoted wall, \\n\\n And nodding Ilion waits the impending fall. \\n\\n This hear observant, and the gods obey!\u0027 \\n\\n The vision spoke, and pass\u0027d in air away. \\n\\n Now, valiant chiefs! since heaven itself alarms, \\n\\n Unite, and rouse the sons of Greece to arms. \\n\\n But first, with caution, try what yet they dare, \\n\\n Worn with nine years of unsuccessful war. \\n\\n To move the troops to measure back the main, \\n\\n Be mine; and yours the province to detain.\" \\n\\n He spoke, and sat: when Nestor, rising said, \\n\\n (Nestor, whom Pylos\u0027 sandy realms obey\u0027d,) \\n\\n \"Princes of Greece, your faithful ears incline, \\n\\n Nor doubt the vision of the powers divine; \\n\\n Sent by great Jove to him who rules the host, \\n\\n Forbid it, heaven! this warning should be lost! \\n\\n Then let us haste, obey the god\u0027s alarms, \\n\\n And join to rouse the sons of Greece to arms.\" \\n\\n Thus spoke the sage: the kings without delay \\n\\n Dissolve the council, and their chief obey: \\n\\n The sceptred rulers lead; the following host, \\n\\n Pour\u0027d forth by thousands, darkens all the coast. \\n\\n As from some rocky cleft the shepherd sees \\n\\n Clustering in heaps on heaps the driving bees, \\n\\n Rolling and blackening, swarms succeeding swarms, \\n\\n With deeper murmurs and more hoarse alarms; \\n\\n Dusky they spread, a close embodied crowd, \\n\\n And o\u0027er the vale descends the living cloud.81 \\n\\n So, from the tents and ships, a lengthen\u0027d train \\n\\n Spreads all the beach, and wide o\u0027ershades the plain: \\n\\n Along the region runs a deafening sound; \\n\\n Beneath their footsteps groans the trembling ground. \\n\\n Fame flies before the messenger of Jove, \\n\\n And shining soars, and claps her wings above. \\n\\n [pg 029] \\n\\n Nine sacred heralds now, proclaiming loud82 \\n\\n The monarch\u0027s will, suspend the listening crowd. \\n\\n Soon as the throngs in order ranged appear, \\n\\n And fainter murmurs died upon the ear, \\n\\n The king of kings his awful figure raised: \\n\\n High in his hand the golden sceptre blazed; \\n\\n The golden sceptre, of celestial flame, \\n\\n By Vulcan form\u0027d, from Jove to Hermes came. \\n\\n To Pelops he the immortal gift resign\u0027d; \\n\\n The immortal gift great Pelops left behind, \\n\\n In Atreus\u0027 hand, which not with Atreus ends, \\n\\n To rich Thyestes next the prize descends; \\n\\n And now the mark of Agamemnon\u0027s reign, \\n\\n Subjects all Argos, and controls the main.83 \\n\\n On this bright sceptre now the king reclined, \\n\\n And artful thus pronounced the speech design\u0027d: \\n\\n \"Ye sons of Mars, partake your leader\u0027s care, \\n\\n Heroes of Greece, and brothers of the war! \\n\\n Of partial Jove with justice I complain, \\n\\n And heavenly oracles believed in vain \\n\\n A safe return was promised to our toils, \\n\\n Renown\u0027d, triumphant, and enrich\u0027d with spoils. \\n\\n Now shameful flight alone can save the host, \\n\\n Our blood, our treasure, and our glory lost. \\n\\n So Jove decrees, resistless lord of all! \\n\\n At whose command whole empires rise or fall: \\n\\n He shakes the feeble props of human trust, \\n\\n And towns and armies humbles to the dust \\n\\n What shame to Greece a fruitful war to wage, \\n\\n Oh, lasting shame in every future age! \\n\\n Once great in arms, the common scorn we grow, \\n\\n Repulsed and baffled by a feeble foe. \\n\\n So small their number, that if wars were ceased, \\n\\n And Greece triumphant held a general feast, \\n\\n [pg 030] \\n\\n All rank\u0027d by tens, whole decades when they dine \\n\\n Must want a Trojan slave to pour the wine.84 \\n\\n But other forces have our hopes o\u0027erthrown, \\n\\n And Troy prevails by armies not her own. \\n\\n Now nine long years of mighty Jove are run, \\n\\n Since first the labours of this war begun: \\n\\n Our cordage torn, decay\u0027d our vessels lie, \\n\\n And scarce insure the wretched power to fly. \\n\\n Haste, then, for ever leave the Trojan wall! \\n\\n Our weeping wives, our tender children call: \\n\\n Love, duty, safety, summon us away, \\n\\n \u0027Tis nature\u0027s voice, and nature we obey, \\n\\n Our shatter\u0027d barks may yet transport us o\u0027er, \\n\\n Safe and inglorious, to our native shore. \\n\\n Fly, Grecians, fly, your sails and oars employ, \\n\\n And dream no more of heaven-defended Troy.\" \\n\\n His deep design unknown, the hosts approve \\n\\n Atrides\u0027 speech. The mighty numbers move. \\n\\n So roll the billows to the Icarian shore, \\n\\n From east and south when winds begin to roar, \\n\\n Burst their dark mansions in the clouds, and sweep \\n\\n The whitening surface of the ruffled deep. \\n\\n And as on corn when western gusts descend,85 \\n\\n Before the blast the lofty harvests bend: \\n\\n Thus o\u0027er the field the moving host appears, \\n\\n With nodding plumes and groves of waving spears. \\n\\n The gathering murmur spreads, their trampling feet \\n\\n Beat the loose sands, and thicken to the fleet; \\n\\n With long-resounding cries they urge the train \\n\\n To fit the ships, and launch into the main. \\n\\n They toil, they sweat, thick clouds of dust arise, \\n\\n The doubling clamours echo to the skies. \\n\\n E\u0027en then the Greeks had left the hostile plain, \\n\\n And fate decreed the fall of Troy in vain; \\n\\n But Jove\u0027s imperial queen their flight survey\u0027d, \\n\\n And sighing thus bespoke the blue-eyed maid: \\n\\n \"Shall then the Grecians fly! O dire disgrace! \\n\\n And leave unpunish\u0027d this perfidious race? \\n\\n Shall Troy, shall Priam, and the adulterous spouse, \\n\\n In peace enjoy the fruits of broken vows? \\n\\n And bravest chiefs, in Helen\u0027s quarrel slain, \\n\\n Lie unrevenged on yon detested plain? \\n\\n No: let my Greeks, unmoved by vain alarms, \\n\\n Once more refulgent shine in brazen arms. \\n\\n [pg 031] \\n\\n Haste, goddess, haste! the flying host detain, \\n\\n Nor let one sail be hoisted on the main.\" \\n\\n Pallas obeys, and from Olympus\u0027 height \\n\\n Swift to the ships precipitates her flight. \\n\\n Ulysses, first in public cares, she found, \\n\\n For prudent counsel like the gods renown\u0027d: \\n\\n Oppress\u0027d with generous grief the hero stood, \\n\\n Nor drew his sable vessels to the flood. \\n\\n \"And is it thus, divine Laertes\u0027 son, \\n\\n Thus fly the Greeks (the martial maid begun), \\n\\n Thus to their country bear their own disgrace, \\n\\n And fame eternal leave to Priam\u0027s race? \\n\\n Shall beauteous Helen still remain unfreed, \\n\\n Still unrevenged, a thousand heroes bleed! \\n\\n Haste, generous Ithacus! prevent the shame, \\n\\n Recall your armies, and your chiefs reclaim. \\n\\n Your own resistless eloquence employ, \\n\\n And to the immortals trust the fall of Troy.\" \\n\\n The voice divine confess\u0027d the warlike maid, \\n\\n Ulysses heard, nor uninspired obey\u0027d: \\n\\n Then meeting first Atrides, from his hand \\n\\n Received the imperial sceptre of command. \\n\\n Thus graced, attention and respect to gain, \\n\\n He runs, he flies through all the Grecian train; \\n\\n Each prince of name, or chief in arms approved, \\n\\n He fired with praise, or with persuasion moved. \\n\\n \"Warriors like you, with strength and wisdom bless\u0027d, \\n\\n By brave examples should confirm the rest. \\n\\n The monarch\u0027s will not yet reveal\u0027d appears; \\n\\n He tries our courage, but resents our fears. \\n\\n The unwary Greeks his fury may provoke; \\n\\n Not thus the king in secret council spoke. \\n\\n Jove loves our chief, from Jove his honour springs, \\n\\n Beware! for dreadful is the wrath of kings.\" \\n\\n But if a clamorous vile plebeian rose, \\n\\n Him with reproof he check\u0027d or tamed with blows. \\n\\n \"Be still, thou slave, and to thy betters yield; \\n\\n Unknown alike in council and in field! \\n\\n Ye gods, what dastards would our host command! \\n\\n Swept to the war, the lumber of a land. \\n\\n Be silent, wretch, and think not here allow\u0027d \\n\\n That worst of tyrants, an usurping crowd. \\n\\n To one sole monarch Jove commits the sway; \\n\\n His are the laws, and him let all obey.\"86 \\n\\n With words like these the troops Ulysses ruled, \\n\\n The loudest silenced, and the fiercest cool\u0027d. \\n\\n [pg 032] \\n\\n Back to the assembly roll the thronging train, \\n\\n Desert the ships, and pour upon the plain. \\n\\n Murmuring they move, as when old ocean roars, \\n\\n And heaves huge surges to the trembling shores; \\n\\n The groaning banks are burst with bellowing sound, \\n\\n The rocks remurmur and the deeps rebound. \\n\\n At length the tumult sinks, the noises cease, \\n\\n And a still silence lulls the camp to peace. \\n\\n Thersites only clamour\u0027d in the throng, \\n\\n Loquacious, loud, and turbulent of tongue: \\n\\n Awed by no shame, by no respect controll\u0027d, \\n\\n In scandal busy, in reproaches bold: \\n\\n With witty malice studious to defame, \\n\\n Scorn all his joy, and laughter all his aim:— \\n\\n But chief he gloried with licentious style \\n\\n To lash the great, and monarchs to revile. \\n\\n His figure such as might his soul proclaim; \\n\\n One eye was blinking, and one leg was lame: \\n\\n His mountain shoulders half his breast o\u0027erspread, \\n\\n Thin hairs bestrew\u0027d his long misshapen head. \\n\\n Spleen to mankind his envious heart possess\u0027d, \\n\\n And much he hated all, but most the best: \\n\\n Ulysses or Achilles still his theme; \\n\\n But royal scandal his delight supreme, \\n\\n Long had he lived the scorn of every Greek, \\n\\n Vex\u0027d when he spoke, yet still they heard him speak. \\n\\n Sharp was his voice; which in the shrillest tone, \\n\\n Thus with injurious taunts attack\u0027d the throne. \\n\\n \"Amidst the glories of so bright a reign, \\n\\n What moves the great Atrides to complain? \\n\\n \u0027Tis thine whate\u0027er the warrior\u0027s breast inflames, \\n\\n The golden spoil, and thine the lovely dames. \\n\\n With all the wealth our wars and blood bestow, \\n\\n Thy tents are crowded and thy chests o\u0027erflow. \\n\\n Thus at full ease in heaps of riches roll\u0027d, \\n\\n What grieves the monarch? Is it thirst of gold? \\n\\n Say, shall we march with our unconquer\u0027d powers \\n\\n (The Greeks and I) to Ilion\u0027s hostile towers, \\n\\n And bring the race of royal bastards here, \\n\\n For Troy to ransom at a price too dear? \\n\\n But safer plunder thy own host supplies; \\n\\n Say, wouldst thou seize some valiant leader\u0027s prize? \\n\\n Or, if thy heart to generous love be led, \\n\\n Some captive fair, to bless thy kingly bed? \\n\\n Whate\u0027er our master craves submit we must, \\n\\n Plagued with his pride, or punish\u0027d for his lust. \\n\\n Oh women of Achaia; men no more! \\n\\n Hence let us fly, and let him waste his store \\n\\n In loves and pleasures on the Phrygian shore. \\n\\n We may be wanted on some busy day, \\n\\n [pg 033] \\n\\n When Hector comes: so great Achilles may: \\n\\n From him he forced the prize we jointly gave, \\n\\n From him, the fierce, the fearless, and the brave: \\n\\n And durst he, as he ought, resent that wrong, \\n\\n This mighty tyrant were no tyrant long.\" \\n\\n Fierce from his seat at this Ulysses springs,87 \\n\\n In generous vengeance of the king of kings. \\n\\n With indignation sparkling in his eyes, \\n\\n He views the wretch, and sternly thus replies: \\n\\n \"Peace, factious monster, born to vex the state, \\n\\n With wrangling talents form\u0027d for foul debate: \\n\\n Curb that impetuous tongue, nor rashly vain, \\n\\n And singly mad, asperse the sovereign reign. \\n\\n Have we not known thee, slave! of all our host, \\n\\n The man who acts the least, upbraids the most? \\n\\n Think not the Greeks to shameful flight to bring, \\n\\n Nor let those lips profane the name of king. \\n\\n For our return we trust the heavenly powers; \\n\\n Be that their care; to fight like men be ours. \\n\\n But grant the host with wealth the general load, \\n\\n Except detraction, what hast thou bestow\u0027d? \\n\\n Suppose some hero should his spoils resign, \\n\\n Art thou that hero, could those spoils be thine? \\n\\n Gods! let me perish on this hateful shore, \\n\\n And let these eyes behold my son no more; \\n\\n If, on thy next offence, this hand forbear \\n\\n To strip those arms thou ill deserv\u0027st to wear, \\n\\n Expel the council where our princes meet, \\n\\n And send thee scourged and howling through the fleet.\" \\n\\n He said, and cowering as the dastard bends, \\n\\n The weighty sceptre on his bank descends.88 \\n\\n [pg 034] \\n\\n On the round bunch the bloody tumours rise: \\n\\n The tears spring starting from his haggard eyes; \\n\\n Trembling he sat, and shrunk in abject fears, \\n\\n From his vile visage wiped the scalding tears; \\n\\n While to his neighbour each express\u0027d his thought: \\n\\n \"Ye gods! what wonders has Ulysses wrought! \\n\\n What fruits his conduct and his courage yield! \\n\\n Great in the council, glorious in the field. \\n\\n Generous he rises in the crown\u0027s defence, \\n\\n To curb the factious tongue of insolence, \\n\\n Such just examples on offenders shown, \\n\\n Sedition silence, and assert the throne.\" \\n\\n \u0027Twas thus the general voice the hero praised, \\n\\n Who, rising, high the imperial sceptre raised: \\n\\n The blue-eyed Pallas, his celestial friend, \\n\\n (In form a herald,) bade the crowds attend. \\n\\n The expecting crowds in still attention hung, \\n\\n To hear the wisdom of his heavenly tongue. \\n\\n Then deeply thoughtful, pausing ere he spoke, \\n\\n His silence thus the prudent hero broke: \\n\\n \"Unhappy monarch! whom the Grecian race \\n\\n With shame deserting, heap with vile disgrace. \\n\\n Not such at Argos was their generous vow: \\n\\n Once all their voice, but ah! forgotten now: \\n\\n Ne\u0027er to return, was then the common cry, \\n\\n Till Troy\u0027s proud structures should in ashes lie. \\n\\n Behold them weeping for their native shore; \\n\\n What could their wives or helpless children more? \\n\\n What heart but melts to leave the tender train, \\n\\n And, one short month, endure the wintry main? \\n\\n Few leagues removed, we wish our peaceful seat, \\n\\n When the ship tosses, and the tempests beat: \\n\\n Then well may this long stay provoke their tears, \\n\\n The tedious length of nine revolving years. \\n\\n Not for their grief the Grecian host I blame; \\n\\n But vanquish\u0027d! baffled! oh, eternal shame! \\n\\n Expect the time to Troy\u0027s destruction given. \\n\\n And try the faith of Chalcas and of heaven. \\n\\n What pass\u0027d at Aulis, Greece can witness bear,89 \\n\\n And all who live to breathe this Phrygian air. \\n\\n Beside a fountain\u0027s sacred brink we raised \\n\\n Our verdant altars, and the victims blazed: \\n\\n \u0027Twas where the plane-tree spread its shades around, \\n\\n The altars heaved; and from the crumbling ground \\n\\n A mighty dragon shot, of dire portent; \\n\\n From Jove himself the dreadful sign was sent. \\n\\n [pg 035] \\n\\n Straight to the tree his sanguine spires he roll\u0027d, \\n\\n And curl\u0027d around in many a winding fold; \\n\\n The topmost branch a mother-bird possess\u0027d; \\n\\n Eight callow infants fill\u0027d the mossy nest; \\n\\n Herself the ninth; the serpent, as he hung, \\n\\n Stretch\u0027d his black jaws and crush\u0027d the crying young; \\n\\n While hovering near, with miserable moan, \\n\\n The drooping mother wail\u0027d her children gone. \\n\\n The mother last, as round the nest she flew, \\n\\n Seized by the beating wing, the monster slew; \\n\\n Nor long survived: to marble turn\u0027d, he stands \\n\\n A lasting prodigy on Aulis\u0027 sands. \\n\\n Such was the will of Jove; and hence we dare \\n\\n Trust in his omen, and support the war. \\n\\n For while around we gazed with wondering eyes, \\n\\n And trembling sought the powers with sacrifice, \\n\\n Full of his god, the reverend Chalcas cried,90 \\n\\n \u0027Ye Grecian warriors! lay your fears aside. \\n\\n This wondrous signal Jove himself displays, \\n\\n Of long, long labours, but eternal praise. \\n\\n As many birds as by the snake were slain, \\n\\n So many years the toils of Greece remain; \\n\\n But wait the tenth, for Ilion\u0027s fall decreed:\u0027 \\n\\n Thus spoke the prophet, thus the Fates succeed. \\n\\n Obey, ye Grecians! with submission wait, \\n\\n Nor let your flight avert the Trojan fate.\" \\n\\n He said: the shores with loud applauses sound, \\n\\n The hollow ships each deafening shout rebound. \\n\\n Then Nestor thus—\"These vain debates forbear, \\n\\n Ye talk like children, not like heroes dare. \\n\\n Where now are all your high resolves at last? \\n\\n Your leagues concluded, your engagements past? \\n\\n Vow\u0027d with libations and with victims then, \\n\\n Now vanish\u0027d like their smoke: the faith of men! \\n\\n While useless words consume the unactive hours, \\n\\n No wonder Troy so long resists our powers. \\n\\n Rise, great Atrides! and with courage sway; \\n\\n We march to war, if thou direct the way. \\n\\n But leave the few that dare resist thy laws, \\n\\n The mean deserters of the Grecian cause, \\n\\n To grudge the conquests mighty Jove prepares, \\n\\n And view with envy our successful wars. \\n\\n On that great day, when first the martial train, \\n\\n Big with the fate of Ilion, plough\u0027d the main, \\n\\n Jove, on the right, a prosperous signal sent, \\n\\n And thunder rolling shook the firmament. \\n\\n Encouraged hence, maintain the glorious strife, \\n\\n Till every soldier grasp a Phrygian wife, \\n\\n [pg 036] \\n\\n Till Helen\u0027s woes at full revenged appear, \\n\\n And Troy\u0027s proud matrons render tear for tear. \\n\\n Before that day, if any Greek invite \\n\\n His country\u0027s troops to base, inglorious flight, \\n\\n Stand forth that Greek! and hoist his sail to fly, \\n\\n And die the dastard first, who dreads to die. \\n\\n But now, O monarch! all thy chiefs advise:91 \\n\\n Nor what they offer, thou thyself despise. \\n\\n Among those counsels, let not mine be vain; \\n\\n In tribes and nations to divide thy train: \\n\\n His separate troops let every leader call, \\n\\n Each strengthen each, and all encourage all. \\n\\n What chief, or soldier, of the numerous band, \\n\\n Or bravely fights, or ill obeys command, \\n\\n When thus distinct they war, shall soon be known \\n\\n And what the cause of Ilion not o\u0027erthrown; \\n\\n If fate resists, or if our arms are slow, \\n\\n If gods above prevent, or men below.\" \\n\\n To him the king: \"How much thy years excel \\n\\n In arts of counsel, and in speaking well! \\n\\n O would the gods, in love to Greece, decree \\n\\n But ten such sages as they grant in thee; \\n\\n Such wisdom soon should Priam\u0027s force destroy, \\n\\n And soon should fall the haughty towers of Troy! \\n\\n But Jove forbids, who plunges those he hates \\n\\n In fierce contention and in vain debates: \\n\\n Now great Achilles from our aid withdraws, \\n\\n By me provoked; a captive maid the cause: \\n\\n If e\u0027er as friends we join, the Trojan wall \\n\\n Must shake, and heavy will the vengeance fall! \\n\\n But now, ye warriors, take a short repast; \\n\\n And, well refresh\u0027d, to bloody conflict haste. \\n\\n His sharpen\u0027d spear let every Grecian wield, \\n\\n And every Grecian fix his brazen shield, \\n\\n Let all excite the fiery steeds of war, \\n\\n And all for combat fit the rattling car. \\n\\n This day, this dreadful day, let each contend; \\n\\n No rest, no respite, till the shades descend; \\n\\n Till darkness, or till death, shall cover all: \\n\\n Let the war bleed, and let the mighty fall; \\n\\n Till bathed in sweat be every manly breast, \\n\\n With the huge shield each brawny arm depress\u0027d, \\n\\n Each aching nerve refuse the lance to throw, \\n\\n And each spent courser at the chariot blow. \\n\\n Who dares, inglorious, in his ships to stay, \\n\\n Who dares to tremble on this signal day; \\n\\n That wretch, too mean to fall by martial power, \\n\\n The birds shall mangle, and the dogs devour.\" \\n\\n [pg 037] \\n\\n The monarch spoke; and straight a murmur rose, \\n\\n Loud as the surges when the tempest blows, \\n\\n That dash\u0027d on broken rocks tumultuous roar, \\n\\n And foam and thunder on the stony shore. \\n\\n Straight to the tents the troops dispersing bend, \\n\\n The fires are kindled, and the smokes ascend; \\n\\n With hasty feasts they sacrifice, and pray, \\n\\n To avert the dangers of the doubtful day. \\n\\n A steer of five years\u0027 age, large limb\u0027d, and fed,92 \\n\\n To Jove\u0027s high altars Agamemnon led: \\n\\n There bade the noblest of the Grecian peers; \\n\\n And Nestor first, as most advanced in years. \\n\\n Next came Idomeneus,93 \\n\\n and Tydeus\u0027 son,94 \\n\\n Ajax the less, and Ajax Telamon;95 \\n\\n Then wise Ulysses in his rank was placed; \\n\\n And Menelaus came, unbid, the last.96 \\n\\n The chiefs surround the destined beast, and take \\n\\n The sacred offering of the salted cake: \\n\\n When thus the king prefers his solemn prayer; \\n\\n \"O thou! whose thunder rends the clouded air, \\n\\n Who in the heaven of heavens hast fixed thy throne, \\n\\n Supreme of gods! unbounded, and alone! \\n\\n Hear! and before the burning sun descends, \\n\\n Before the night her gloomy veil extends, \\n\\n Low in the dust be laid yon hostile spires, \\n\\n Be Priam\u0027s palace sunk in Grecian fires. \\n\\n In Hector\u0027s breast be plunged this shining sword, \\n\\n And slaughter\u0027d heroes groan around their lord!\" \\n\\n Thus prayed the chief: his unavailing prayer \\n\\n Great Jove refused, and toss\u0027d in empty air: \\n\\n The God averse, while yet the fumes arose, \\n\\n Prepared new toils, and doubled woes on woes. \\n\\n Their prayers perform\u0027d the chiefs the rite pursue, \\n\\n The barley sprinkled, and the victim slew. \\n\\n [pg 038] \\n\\n The limbs they sever from the inclosing hide, \\n\\n The thighs, selected to the gods, divide. \\n\\n On these, in double cauls involved with art, \\n\\n The choicest morsels lie from every part, \\n\\n From the cleft wood the crackling flames aspire \\n\\n While the fat victims feed the sacred fire. \\n\\n The thighs thus sacrificed, and entrails dress\u0027d \\n\\n The assistants part, transfix, and roast the rest; \\n\\n Then spread the tables, the repast prepare, \\n\\n Each takes his seat, and each receives his share. \\n\\n Soon as the rage of hunger was suppress\u0027d, \\n\\n The generous Nestor thus the prince address\u0027d. \\n\\n \"Now bid thy heralds sound the loud alarms, \\n\\n And call the squadrons sheathed in brazen arms; \\n\\n Now seize the occasion, now the troops survey, \\n\\n And lead to war when heaven directs the way.\" \\n\\n He said; the monarch issued his commands; \\n\\n Straight the loud heralds call the gathering bands \\n\\n The chiefs inclose their king; the hosts divide, \\n\\n In tribes and nations rank\u0027d on either side. \\n\\n High in the midst the blue-eyed virgin flies; \\n\\n From rank to rank she darts her ardent eyes; \\n\\n The dreadful aegis, Jove\u0027s immortal shield, \\n\\n Blazed on her arm, and lighten\u0027d all the field: \\n\\n Round the vast orb a hundred serpents roll\u0027d, \\n\\n Form\u0027d the bright fringe, and seem\u0027d to burn in gold, \\n\\n With this each Grecian\u0027s manly breast she warms, \\n\\n Swells their bold hearts, and strings their nervous arms, \\n\\n No more they sigh, inglorious, to return, \\n\\n But breathe revenge, and for the combat burn. \\n\\n As on some mountain, through the lofty grove, \\n\\n The crackling flames ascend, and blaze above; \\n\\n The fires expanding, as the winds arise, \\n\\n Shoot their long beams, and kindle half the skies: \\n\\n So from the polish\u0027d arms, and brazen shields, \\n\\n A gleamy splendour flash\u0027d along the fields. \\n\\n Not less their number than the embodied cranes, \\n\\n Or milk-white swans in Asius\u0027 watery plains. \\n\\n That, o\u0027er the windings of Cayster\u0027s springs,97 \\n\\n Stretch their long necks, and clap their rustling wings, \\n\\n Now tower aloft, and course in airy rounds, \\n\\n Now light with noise; with noise the field resounds. \\n\\n Thus numerous and confused, extending wide, \\n\\n The legions crowd Scamander\u0027s flowery side;98 \\n\\n [pg 039] \\n\\n With rushing troops the plains are cover\u0027d o\u0027er, \\n\\n And thundering footsteps shake the sounding shore. \\n\\n Along the river\u0027s level meads they stand, \\n\\n Thick as in spring the flowers adorn the land, \\n\\n Or leaves the trees; or thick as insects play, \\n\\n The wandering nation of a summer\u0027s day: \\n\\n That, drawn by milky steams, at evening hours, \\n\\n In gather\u0027d swarms surround the rural bowers; \\n\\n From pail to pail with busy murmur run \\n\\n The gilded legions, glittering in the sun. \\n\\n So throng\u0027d, so close, the Grecian squadrons stood \\n\\n In radiant arms, and thirst for Trojan blood. \\n\\n Each leader now his scatter\u0027d force conjoins \\n\\n In close array, and forms the deepening lines. \\n\\n Not with more ease the skilful shepherd-swain \\n\\n Collects his flocks from thousands on the plain. \\n\\n The king of kings, majestically tall, \\n\\n Towers o\u0027er his armies, and outshines them all; \\n\\n Like some proud bull, that round the pastures leads \\n\\n His subject herds, the monarch of the meads, \\n\\n Great as the gods, the exalted chief was seen, \\n\\n His strength like Neptune, and like Mars his mien;99 \\n\\n Jove o\u0027er his eyes celestial glories spread, \\n\\n And dawning conquest played around his head. \\n\\n Say, virgins, seated round the throne divine, \\n\\n All-knowing goddesses! immortal nine!100 \\n\\n Since earth\u0027s wide regions, heaven\u0027s umneasur\u0027d height, \\n\\n And hell\u0027s abyss, hide nothing from your sight, \\n\\n (We, wretched mortals! lost in doubts below, \\n\\n But guess by rumour, and but boast we know,) \\n\\n O say what heroes, fired by thirst of fame, \\n\\n Or urged by wrongs, to Troy\u0027s destruction came. \\n\\n To count them all, demands a thousand tongues, \\n\\n A throat of brass, and adamantine lungs. \\n\\n Daughters of Jove, assist! inspired by you \\n\\n The mighty labour dauntless I pursue; \\n\\n [pg 040] \\n\\n What crowded armies, from what climes they bring, \\n\\n Their names, their numbers, and their chiefs I sing. \\n\\n \\n\\n THE CATALOGUE OF THE SHIPS.101 \\n\\n \\n\\n Illustration: NEPTUNE. \\n\\n NEPTUNE. \\n\\n The hardy warriors whom Boeotia bred, \\n\\n Penelius, Leitus, Prothoenor, led: \\n\\n With these Arcesilaus and Clonius stand, \\n\\n Equal in arms, and equal in command. \\n\\n These head the troops that rocky Aulis yields, \\n\\n And Eteon\u0027s hills, and Hyrie\u0027s watery fields, \\n\\n And Schoenos, Scholos, Graea near the main, \\n\\n And Mycalessia\u0027s ample piny plain; \\n\\n Those who in Peteon or Ilesion dwell, \\n\\n Or Harma where Apollo\u0027s prophet fell; \\n\\n Heleon and Hyle, which the springs o\u0027erflow; \\n\\n And Medeon lofty, and Ocalea low; \\n\\n Or in the meads of Haliartus stray, \\n\\n Or Thespia sacred to the god of day: \\n\\n Onchestus, Neptune\u0027s celebrated groves; \\n\\n Copae, and Thisbe, famed for silver doves; \\n\\n [pg 041] \\n\\n For flocks Erythrae, Glissa for the vine; \\n\\n Platea green, and Nysa the divine; \\n\\n And they whom Thebe\u0027s well-built walls inclose, \\n\\n Where Myde, Eutresis, Corone, rose; \\n\\n And Arne rich, with purple harvests crown\u0027d; \\n\\n And Anthedon, Boeotia\u0027s utmost bound. \\n\\n Full fifty ships they send, and each conveys \\n\\n Twice sixty warriors through the foaming seas.102 \\n\\n To these succeed Aspledon\u0027s martial train, \\n\\n Who plough the spacious Orchomenian plain. \\n\\n Two valiant brothers rule the undaunted throng, \\n\\n Ialmen and Ascalaphus the strong: \\n\\n Sons of Astyoche, the heavenly fair, \\n\\n Whose virgin charms subdued the god of war: \\n\\n (In Actor\u0027s court as she retired to rest, \\n\\n The strength of Mars the blushing maid compress\u0027d) \\n\\n Their troops in thirty sable vessels sweep, \\n\\n With equal oars, the hoarse-resounding deep. \\n\\n The Phocians next in forty barks repair; \\n\\n Epistrophus and Schedius head the war: \\n\\n From those rich regions where Cephisus leads \\n\\n His silver current through the flowery meads; \\n\\n From Panopea, Chrysa the divine, \\n\\n Where Anemoria\u0027s stately turrets shine, \\n\\n Where Pytho, Daulis, Cyparissus stood, \\n\\n And fair Lilaea views the rising flood. \\n\\n These, ranged in order on the floating tide, \\n\\n Close, on the left, the bold Boeotians\u0027 side. \\n\\n Fierce Ajax led the Locrian squadrons on, \\n\\n Ajax the less, Oileus\u0027 valiant son; \\n\\n Skill\u0027d to direct the flying dart aright; \\n\\n Swift in pursuit, and active in the fight. \\n\\n Him, as their chief, the chosen troops attend, \\n\\n Which Bessa, Thronus, and rich Cynos send; \\n\\n Opus, Calliarus, and Scarphe\u0027s bands; \\n\\n And those who dwell where pleasing Augia stands, \\n\\n And where Boagrius floats the lowly lands, \\n\\n Or in fair Tarphe\u0027s sylvan seats reside: \\n\\n In forty vessels cut the yielding tide. \\n\\n [pg 042] \\n\\n Euboea next her martial sons prepares, \\n\\n And sends the brave Abantes to the wars: \\n\\n Breathing revenge, in arms they take their way \\n\\n From Chalcis\u0027 walls, and strong Eretria; \\n\\n The Isteian fields for generous vines renown\u0027d, \\n\\n The fair Caristos, and the Styrian ground; \\n\\n Where Dios from her towers o\u0027erlooks the plain, \\n\\n And high Cerinthus views the neighbouring main. \\n\\n Down their broad shoulders falls a length of hair; \\n\\n Their hands dismiss not the long lance in air; \\n\\n But with protended spears in fighting fields \\n\\n Pierce the tough corslets and the brazen shields. \\n\\n Twice twenty ships transport the warlike bands, \\n\\n Which bold Elphenor, fierce in arms, commands. \\n\\n Full fifty more from Athens stem the main, \\n\\n Led by Menestheus through the liquid plain. \\n\\n (Athens the fair, where great Erectheus sway\u0027d, \\n\\n That owed his nurture to the blue-eyed maid, \\n\\n But from the teeming furrow took his birth, \\n\\n The mighty offspring of the foodful earth. \\n\\n Him Pallas placed amidst her wealthy fane, \\n\\n Adored with sacrifice and oxen slain; \\n\\n Where, as the years revolve, her altars blaze, \\n\\n And all the tribes resound the goddess\u0027 praise.) \\n\\n No chief like thee, Menestheus! Greece could yield, \\n\\n To marshal armies in the dusty field, \\n\\n The extended wings of battle to display, \\n\\n Or close the embodied host in firm array. \\n\\n Nestor alone, improved by length of days, \\n\\n For martial conduct bore an equal praise. \\n\\n With these appear the Salaminian bands, \\n\\n Whom the gigantic Telamon commands; \\n\\n In twelve black ships to Troy they steer their course, \\n\\n And with the great Athenians join their force. \\n\\n Next move to war the generous Argive train, \\n\\n From high Troezene, and Maseta\u0027s plain, \\n\\n And fair ?gina circled by the main: \\n\\n Whom strong Tyrinthe\u0027s lofty walls surround, \\n\\n And Epidaure with viny harvests crown\u0027d: \\n\\n And where fair Asinen and Hermoin show \\n\\n Their cliffs above, and ample bay below. \\n\\n These by the brave Euryalus were led, \\n\\n Great Sthenelus, and greater Diomed; \\n\\n But chief Tydides bore the sovereign sway: \\n\\n In fourscore barks they plough the watery way. \\n\\n The proud Mycene arms her martial powers, \\n\\n Cleone, Corinth, with imperial towers,103 \\n\\n [pg 043] \\n\\n Fair Araethyrea, Ornia\u0027s fruitful plain, \\n\\n And ?gion, and Adrastus\u0027 ancient reign; \\n\\n And those who dwell along the sandy shore, \\n\\n And where Pellene yields her fleecy store, \\n\\n Where Helice and Hyperesia lie, \\n\\n And Gonoessa\u0027s spires salute the sky. \\n\\n Great Agamemnon rules the numerous band, \\n\\n A hundred vessels in long order stand, \\n\\n And crowded nations wait his dread command. \\n\\n High on the deck the king of men appears, \\n\\n And his refulgent arms in triumph wears; \\n\\n Proud of his host, unrivall\u0027d in his reign, \\n\\n In silent pomp he moves along the main. \\n\\n His brother follows, and to vengeance warms \\n\\n The hardy Spartans, exercised in arms: \\n\\n Phares and Brysia\u0027s valiant troops, and those \\n\\n Whom Lacedaemon\u0027s lofty hills inclose; \\n\\n Or Messe\u0027s towers for silver doves renown\u0027d, \\n\\n Amyclae, Laas, Augia\u0027s happy ground, \\n\\n And those whom OEtylos\u0027 low walls contain, \\n\\n And Helos, on the margin of the main: \\n\\n These, o\u0027er the bending ocean, Helen\u0027s cause, \\n\\n In sixty ships with Menelaus draws: \\n\\n Eager and loud from man to man he flies, \\n\\n Revenge and fury flaming in his eyes; \\n\\n While vainly fond, in fancy oft he hears \\n\\n The fair one\u0027s grief, and sees her falling tears. \\n\\n In ninety sail, from Pylos\u0027 sandy coast, \\n\\n Nestor the sage conducts his chosen host: \\n\\n From Amphigenia\u0027s ever-fruitful land, \\n\\n Where ?py high, and little Pteleon stand; \\n\\n Where beauteous Arene her structures shows, \\n\\n And Thryon\u0027s walls Alpheus\u0027 streams inclose: \\n\\n And Dorion, famed for Thamyris\u0027 disgrace, \\n\\n Superior once of all the tuneful race, \\n\\n Till, vain of mortals\u0027 empty praise, he strove \\n\\n To match the seed of cloud-compelling Jove! \\n\\n Too daring bard! whose unsuccessful pride \\n\\n The immortal Muses in their art defied. \\n\\n The avenging Muses of the light of day \\n\\n Deprived his eyes, and snatch\u0027d his voice away; \\n\\n No more his heavenly voice was heard to sing, \\n\\n His hand no more awaked the silver string. \\n\\n Where under high Cyllene, crown\u0027d with wood, \\n\\n The shaded tomb of old ?pytus stood; \\n\\n From Ripe, Stratie, Tegea\u0027s bordering towns, \\n\\n The Phenean fields, and Orchomenian downs, \\n\\n Where the fat herds in plenteous pasture rove; \\n\\n And Stymphelus with her surrounding grove; \\n\\n Parrhasia, on her snowy cliffs reclined, \\n\\n [pg 044] \\n\\n And high Enispe shook by wintry wind, \\n\\n And fair Mantinea\u0027s ever-pleasing site; \\n\\n In sixty sail the Arcadian bands unite. \\n\\n Bold Agapenor, glorious at their head, \\n\\n (Ancaeus\u0027 son) the mighty squadron led. \\n\\n Their ships, supplied by Agamemnon\u0027s care, \\n\\n Through roaring seas the wondering warriors bear; \\n\\n The first to battle on the appointed plain, \\n\\n But new to all the dangers of the main. \\n\\n Those, where fair Elis and Buprasium join; \\n\\n Whom Hyrmin, here, and Myrsinus confine, \\n\\n And bounded there, where o\u0027er the valleys rose \\n\\n The Olenian rock; and where Alisium flows; \\n\\n Beneath four chiefs (a numerous army) came: \\n\\n The strength and glory of the Epean name. \\n\\n In separate squadrons these their train divide, \\n\\n Each leads ten vessels through the yielding tide. \\n\\n One was Amphimachus, and Thalpius one; \\n\\n (Eurytus\u0027 this, and that Teatus\u0027 son;) \\n\\n Diores sprung from Amarynceus\u0027 line; \\n\\n And great Polyxenus, of force divine. \\n\\n But those who view fair Elis o\u0027er the seas \\n\\n From the blest islands of the Echinades, \\n\\n In forty vessels under Meges move, \\n\\n Begot by Phyleus, the beloved of Jove: \\n\\n To strong Dulichium from his sire he fled, \\n\\n And thence to Troy his hardy warriors led. \\n\\n Ulysses follow\u0027d through the watery road, \\n\\n A chief, in wisdom equal to a god. \\n\\n With those whom Cephalenia\u0027s line inclosed, \\n\\n Or till their fields along the coast opposed; \\n\\n Or where fair Ithaca o\u0027erlooks the floods, \\n\\n Where high Neritos shakes his waving woods, \\n\\n Where ?gilipa\u0027s rugged sides are seen, \\n\\n Crocylia rocky, and Zacynthus green. \\n\\n These in twelve galleys with vermilion prores, \\n\\n Beneath his conduct sought the Phrygian shores. \\n\\n Thoas came next, Andraemon\u0027s valiant son, \\n\\n From Pleuron\u0027s walls, and chalky Calydon, \\n\\n And rough Pylene, and the Olenian steep, \\n\\n And Chalcis, beaten by the rolling deep. \\n\\n He led the warriors from the ?tolian shore, \\n\\n For now the sons of OEneus were no more! \\n\\n The glories of the mighty race were fled! \\n\\n OEneus himself, and Meleager dead! \\n\\n To Thoas\u0027 care now trust the martial train, \\n\\n His forty vessels follow through the main. \\n\\n Next, eighty barks the Cretan king commands, \\n\\n Of Gnossus, Lyctus, and Gortyna\u0027s bands; \\n\\n And those who dwell where Rhytion\u0027s domes arise, \\n\\n [pg 045] \\n\\n Or white Lycastus glitters to the skies, \\n\\n Or where by Phaestus silver Jardan runs; \\n\\n Crete\u0027s hundred cities pour forth all her sons. \\n\\n These march\u0027d, Idomeneus, beneath thy care, \\n\\n And Merion, dreadful as the god of war. \\n\\n Tlepolemus, the sun of Hercules, \\n\\n Led nine swift vessels through the foamy seas, \\n\\n From Rhodes, with everlasting sunshine bright, \\n\\n Jalyssus, Lindus, and Camirus white. \\n\\n His captive mother fierce Alcides bore \\n\\n From Ephyr\u0027s walls and Selle\u0027s winding shore, \\n\\n Where mighty towns in ruins spread the plain, \\n\\n And saw their blooming warriors early slain. \\n\\n The hero, when to manly years he grew, \\n\\n Alcides\u0027 uncle, old Licymnius, slew; \\n\\n For this, constrain\u0027d to quit his native place, \\n\\n And shun the vengeance of the Herculean race, \\n\\n A fleet he built, and with a numerous train \\n\\n Of willing exiles wander\u0027d o\u0027er the main; \\n\\n Where, many seas and many sufferings past, \\n\\n On happy Rhodes the chief arrived at last: \\n\\n There in three tribes divides his native band, \\n\\n And rules them peaceful in a foreign land; \\n\\n Increased and prosper\u0027d in their new abodes \\n\\n By mighty Jove, the sire of men and gods; \\n\\n With joy they saw the growing empire rise, \\n\\n And showers of wealth descending from the skies. \\n\\n Three ships with Nireus sought the Trojan shore, \\n\\n Nireus, whom Aglae to Charopus bore, \\n\\n Nireus, in faultless shape and blooming grace, \\n\\n The loveliest youth of all the Grecian race;104 \\n\\n Pelides only match\u0027d his early charms; \\n\\n But few his troops, and small his strength in arms. \\n\\n Next thirty galleys cleave the liquid plain, \\n\\n Of those Calydnae\u0027s sea-girt isles contain; \\n\\n With them the youth of Nisyrus repair, \\n\\n Casus the strong, and Crapathus the fair; \\n\\n Cos, where Eurypylus possess\u0027d the sway, \\n\\n Till great Alcides made the realms obey: \\n\\n These Antiphus and bold Phidippus bring, \\n\\n Sprung from the god by Thessalus the king. \\n\\n Now, Muse, recount Pelasgic Argos\u0027 powers, \\n\\n From Alos, Alope, and Trechin\u0027s towers: \\n\\n From Phthia\u0027s spacious vales; and Hella, bless\u0027d \\n\\n With female beauty far beyond the rest. \\n\\n Full fifty ships beneath Achilles\u0027 care, \\n\\n The Achaians, Myrmidons, Hellenians bear; \\n\\n Thessalians all, though various in their name; \\n\\n [pg 046] \\n\\n The same their nation, and their chief the same. \\n\\n But now inglorious, stretch\u0027d along the shore, \\n\\n They hear the brazen voice of war no more; \\n\\n No more the foe they face in dire array: \\n\\n Close in his fleet the angry leader lay; \\n\\n Since fair Briseis from his arms was torn, \\n\\n The noblest spoil from sack\u0027d Lyrnessus borne, \\n\\n Then, when the chief the Theban walls o\u0027erthrew, \\n\\n And the bold sons of great Evenus slew. \\n\\n There mourn\u0027d Achilles, plunged in depth of care, \\n\\n But soon to rise in slaughter, blood, and war. \\n\\n To these the youth of Phylace succeed, \\n\\n Itona, famous for her fleecy breed, \\n\\n And grassy Pteleon deck\u0027d with cheerful greens, \\n\\n The bowers of Ceres, and the sylvan scenes. \\n\\n Sweet Pyrrhasus, with blooming flowerets crown\u0027d, \\n\\n And Antron\u0027s watery dens, and cavern\u0027d ground. \\n\\n These own\u0027d, as chief, Protesilas the brave, \\n\\n Who now lay silent in the gloomy grave: \\n\\n The first who boldly touch\u0027d the Trojan shore, \\n\\n And dyed a Phrygian lance with Grecian gore; \\n\\n There lies, far distant from his native plain; \\n\\n Unfinish\u0027d his proud palaces remain, \\n\\n And his sad consort beats her breast in vain. \\n\\n His troops in forty ships Podarces led, \\n\\n Iphiclus\u0027 son, and brother to the dead; \\n\\n Nor he unworthy to command the host; \\n\\n Yet still they mourn\u0027d their ancient leader lost. \\n\\n The men who Glaphyra\u0027s fair soil partake, \\n\\n Where hills incircle Boebe\u0027s lowly lake, \\n\\n Where Phaere hears the neighbouring waters fall, \\n\\n Or proud Iolcus lifts her airy wall, \\n\\n In ten black ships embark\u0027d for Ilion\u0027s shore, \\n\\n With bold Eumelus, whom Alceste bore: \\n\\n All Pelias\u0027 race Alceste far outshined, \\n\\n The grace and glory of the beauteous kind, \\n\\n The troops Methone or Thaumacia yields, \\n\\n Olizon\u0027s rocks, or Meliboea\u0027s fields, \\n\\n With Philoctetes sail\u0027d whose matchless art \\n\\n From the tough bow directs the feather\u0027d dart. \\n\\n Seven were his ships; each vessel fifty row, \\n\\n Skill\u0027d in his science of the dart and bow. \\n\\n But he lay raging on the Lemnian ground, \\n\\n A poisonous hydra gave the burning wound; \\n\\n There groan\u0027d the chief in agonizing pain, \\n\\n Whom Greece at length shall wish, nor wish in vain. \\n\\n His forces Medon led from Lemnos\u0027 shore, \\n\\n Oileus\u0027 son, whom beauteous Rhena bore. \\n\\n The ?chalian race, in those high towers contain\u0027d \\n\\n Where once Eurytus in proud triumph reign\u0027d, \\n\\n [pg 047] \\n\\n Or where her humbler turrets Tricca rears, \\n\\n Or where Ithome, rough with rocks, appears, \\n\\n In thirty sail the sparkling waves divide, \\n\\n Which Podalirius and Machaon guide. \\n\\n To these his skill their parent-god imparts, \\n\\n Divine professors of the healing arts. \\n\\n The bold Ormenian and Asterian bands \\n\\n In forty barks Eurypylus commands. \\n\\n Where Titan hides his hoary head in snow, \\n\\n And where Hyperia\u0027s silver fountains flow. \\n\\n Thy troops, Argissa, Polypoetes leads, \\n\\n And Eleon, shelter\u0027d by Olympus\u0027 shades, \\n\\n Gyrtone\u0027s warriors; and where Orthe lies, \\n\\n And Oloosson\u0027s chalky cliffs arise. \\n\\n Sprung from Pirithous of immortal race, \\n\\n The fruit of fair Hippodame\u0027s embrace, \\n\\n (That day, when hurl\u0027d from Pelion\u0027s cloudy head, \\n\\n To distant dens the shaggy Centaurs fled) \\n\\n With Polypoetes join\u0027d in equal sway \\n\\n Leonteus leads, and forty ships obey. \\n\\n In twenty sail the bold Perrhaebians came \\n\\n From Cyphus, Guneus was their leader\u0027s name. \\n\\n With these the Enians join\u0027d, and those who freeze \\n\\n Where cold Dodona lifts her holy trees; \\n\\n Or where the pleasing Titaresius glides, \\n\\n And into Peneus rolls his easy tides; \\n\\n Yet o\u0027er the silvery surface pure they flow, \\n\\n The sacred stream unmix\u0027d with streams below, \\n\\n Sacred and awful! from the dark abodes \\n\\n Styx pours them forth, the dreadful oath of gods! \\n\\n Last, under Prothous the Magnesians stood, \\n\\n (Prothous the swift, of old Tenthredon\u0027s blood;) \\n\\n Who dwell where Pelion, crown\u0027d with piny boughs, \\n\\n Obscures the glade, and nods his shaggy brows; \\n\\n Or where through flowery Tempe Peneus stray\u0027d: \\n\\n (The region stretch\u0027d beneath his mighty shade:) \\n\\n In forty sable barks they stemm\u0027d the main; \\n\\n Such were the chiefs, and such the Grecian train. \\n\\n Say next, O Muse! of all Achaia breeds, \\n\\n Who bravest fought, or rein\u0027d the noblest steeds? \\n\\n Eumelus\u0027 mares were foremost in the chase, \\n\\n As eagles fleet, and of Pheretian race; \\n\\n Bred where Pieria\u0027s fruitful fountains flow, \\n\\n And train\u0027d by him who bears the silver bow. \\n\\n Fierce in the fight their nostrils breathed a flame, \\n\\n Their height, their colour, and their age the same; \\n\\n O\u0027er fields of death they whirl the rapid car, \\n\\n And break the ranks, and thunder through the war. \\n\\n Ajax in arms the first renown acquired, \\n\\n While stern Achilles in his wrath retired: \\n\\n [pg 048] \\n\\n (His was the strength that mortal might exceeds, \\n\\n And his the unrivall\u0027d race of heavenly steeds:) \\n\\n But Thetis\u0027 son now shines in arms no more; \\n\\n His troops, neglected on the sandy shore. \\n\\n In empty air their sportive javelins throw, \\n\\n Or whirl the disk, or bend an idle bow: \\n\\n Unstain\u0027d with blood his cover\u0027d chariots stand; \\n\\n The immortal coursers graze along the strand; \\n\\n But the brave chiefs the inglorious life deplored, \\n\\n And, wandering o\u0027er the camp, required their lord. \\n\\n Now, like a deluge, covering all around, \\n\\n The shining armies sweep along the ground; \\n\\n Swift as a flood of fire, when storms arise, \\n\\n Floats the wild field, and blazes to the skies. \\n\\n Earth groan\u0027d beneath them; as when angry Jove \\n\\n Hurls down the forky lightning from above, \\n\\n On Arime when he the thunder throws, \\n\\n And fires Typhoeus with redoubled blows, \\n\\n Where Typhon, press\u0027d beneath the burning load, \\n\\n Still feels the fury of the avenging god. \\n\\n But various Iris, Jove\u0027s commands to bear, \\n\\n Speeds on the wings of winds through liquid air; \\n\\n In Priam\u0027s porch the Trojan chiefs she found, \\n\\n The old consulting, and the youths around. \\n\\n Polites\u0027 shape, the monarch\u0027s son, she chose, \\n\\n Who from ?setes\u0027 tomb observed the foes,105 \\n\\n High on the mound; from whence in prospect lay \\n\\n The fields, the tents, the navy, and the bay. \\n\\n In this dissembled form, she hastes to bring \\n\\n The unwelcome message to the Phrygian king. \\n\\n \"Cease to consult, the time for action calls; \\n\\n War, horrid war, approaches to your walls! \\n\\n Assembled armies oft have I beheld; \\n\\n But ne\u0027er till now such numbers charged a field: \\n\\n Thick as autumnal leaves or driving sand, \\n\\n The moving squadrons blacken all the strand. \\n\\n Thou, godlike Hector! all thy force employ, \\n\\n Assemble all the united bands of Troy; \\n\\n In just array let every leader call \\n\\n The foreign troops: this day demands them all!\" \\n\\n The voice divine the mighty chief alarms; \\n\\n The council breaks, the warriors rush to arms. \\n\\n The gates unfolding pour forth all their train, \\n\\n Nations on nations fill the dusky plain, \\n\\n Men, steeds, and chariots, shake the trembling ground: \\n\\n The tumult thickens, and the skies resound. \\n\\n Amidst the plain, in sight of Ilion, stands \\n\\n [pg 049] \\n\\n A rising mount, the work of human hands; \\n\\n (This for Myrinne\u0027s tomb the immortals know, \\n\\n Though call\u0027d Bateia in the world below;) \\n\\n Beneath their chiefs in martial order here, \\n\\n The auxiliar troops and Trojan hosts appear. \\n\\n The godlike Hector, high above the rest, \\n\\n Shakes his huge spear, and nods his plumy crest: \\n\\n In throngs around his native bands repair, \\n\\n And groves of lances glitter in the air. \\n\\n Divine ?neas brings the Dardan race, \\n\\n Anchises\u0027 son, by Venus\u0027 stolen embrace, \\n\\n Born in the shades of Ida\u0027s secret grove; \\n\\n (A mortal mixing with the queen of love;) \\n\\n Archilochus and Acamas divide \\n\\n The warrior\u0027s toils, and combat by his side. \\n\\n Who fair Zeleia\u0027s wealthy valleys till,106 \\n\\n Fast by the foot of Ida\u0027s sacred hill, \\n\\n Or drink, ?sepus, of thy sable flood, \\n\\n Were led by Pandarus, of royal blood; \\n\\n To whom his art Apollo deign\u0027d to show, \\n\\n Graced with the presents of his shafts and bow. \\n\\n From rich Apaesus and Adrestia\u0027s towers, \\n\\n High Teree\u0027s summits, and Pityea\u0027s bowers; \\n\\n From these the congregated troops obey \\n\\n Young Amphius and Adrastus\u0027 equal sway; \\n\\n Old Merops\u0027 sons; whom, skill\u0027d in fates to come, \\n\\n The sire forewarn\u0027d, and prophesied their doom: \\n\\n Fate urged them on! the sire forewarn\u0027d in vain, \\n\\n They rush\u0027d to war, and perish\u0027d on the plain. \\n\\n From Practius\u0027 stream, Percote\u0027s pasture lands, \\n\\n And Sestos and Abydos\u0027 neighbouring strands, \\n\\n From great Arisba\u0027s walls and Selle\u0027s coast, \\n\\n Asius Hyrtacides conducts his host: \\n\\n High on his car he shakes the flowing reins, \\n\\n His fiery coursers thunder o\u0027er the plains. \\n\\n The fierce Pelasgi next, in war renown\u0027d, \\n\\n March from Larissa\u0027s ever-fertile ground: \\n\\n In equal arms their brother leaders shine, \\n\\n Hippothous bold, and Pyleus the divine. \\n\\n Next Acamas and Pyrous lead their hosts, \\n\\n In dread array, from Thracia\u0027s wintry coasts; \\n\\n Round the bleak realms where Hellespontus roars, \\n\\n And Boreas beats the hoarse-resounding shores. \\n\\n With great Euphemus the Ciconians move, \\n\\n Sprung from Troezenian Ceus, loved by Jove. \\n\\n Pyraechmes the Paeonian troops attend, \\n\\n Skill\u0027d in the fight their crooked bows to bend; \\n\\n From Axius\u0027 ample bed he leads them on, \\n\\n [pg 050] \\n\\n Axius, that laves the distant Amydon, \\n\\n Axius, that swells with all his neighbouring rills, \\n\\n And wide around the floating region fills. \\n\\n The Paphlagonians Pylaemenes rules, \\n\\n Where rich Henetia breeds her savage mules, \\n\\n Where Erythinus\u0027 rising cliffs are seen, \\n\\n Thy groves of box, Cytorus! ever green, \\n\\n And where ?gialus and Cromna lie, \\n\\n And lofty Sesamus invades the sky, \\n\\n And where Parthenius, roll\u0027d through banks of flowers, \\n\\n Reflects her bordering palaces and bowers. \\n\\n Here march\u0027d in arms the Halizonian band, \\n\\n Whom Odius and Epistrophus command, \\n\\n From those far regions where the sun refines \\n\\n The ripening silver in Alybean mines. \\n\\n There mighty Chromis led the Mysian train, \\n\\n And augur Ennomus, inspired in vain; \\n\\n For stern Achilles lopp\u0027d his sacred head, \\n\\n Roll\u0027d down Scamander with the vulgar dead. \\n\\n Phorcys and brave Ascanius here unite \\n\\n The Ascanian Phrygians, eager for the fight. \\n\\n Of those who round Maeonia\u0027s realms reside, \\n\\n Or whom the vales in shades of Tmolus hide, \\n\\n Mestles and Antiphus the charge partake, \\n\\n Born on the banks of Gyges\u0027 silent lake. \\n\\n There, from the fields where wild Maeander flows, \\n\\n High Mycale, and Latmos\u0027 shady brows, \\n\\n And proud Miletus, came the Carian throngs, \\n\\n With mingled clamours and with barbarous tongues.107 \\n\\n Amphimachus and Naustes guide the train, \\n\\n Naustes the bold, Amphimachus the vain, \\n\\n Who, trick\u0027d with gold, and glittering on his car, \\n\\n Rode like a woman to the field of war. \\n\\n Fool that he was! by fierce Achilles slain, \\n\\n The river swept him to the briny main: \\n\\n There whelm\u0027d with waves the gaudy warrior lies \\n\\n The valiant victor seized the golden prize. \\n\\n The forces last in fair array succeed, \\n\\n Which blameless Glaucus and Sarpedon lead \\n\\n The warlike bands that distant Lycia yields, \\n\\n Where gulfy Xanthus foams along the fields. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1549/45989.html","bookId":1297,"book":{"id":1297,"title":"The Iliad of Homer 伊利亚特","description":"简介： 《伊利亚特》，或力量之诗 西蒙娜薇依Simone Weil著 吴雅凌译 《伊利亚特》的真正主角、真正主题和中心是力量。人类所操纵的力量，人类被制服的力量，在力量面前人的肉身一再缩退。在诗中，人的灵魂由于与力量的关系而不停产生变化，灵魂自以为拥有力量，却被力量所牵制...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/03/10-49-56-55-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1549","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:49 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:49 AM"}}
