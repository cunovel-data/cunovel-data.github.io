She persuades Pandarus to aim an arrow at Menelaus, who is wounded, but cured by Machaon. In the meantime some of the Trojan troops attack the Greeks. Agamemnon is distinguished in all the parts of a good general; he reviews the troops, and exhorts the leaders, some by praises and others by reproof. Nestor is particularly celebrated for his military discipline. The battle joins, and great numbers are slain on both sides. \n \n The same day continues through this as through the last book (as it does also through the two following, and almost to the end of the seventh book). The scene is wholly in the field before Troy. \n And now Olympus\u0027 shining gates unfold; \n The gods, with Jove, assume their thrones of gold: \n Immortal Hebe, fresh with bloom divine, \n The golden goblet crowns with purple wine: \n While the full bowls flow round, the powers employ \n Their careful eyes on long-contended Troy. \n When Jove, disposed to tempt Saturnia\u0027s spleen, \n Thus waked the fury of his partial queen, \n \"Two powers divine the son of Atreus aid, \n Imperial Juno, and the martial maid;125 \n But high in heaven they sit, and gaze from far, \n The tame spectators of his deeds of war. \n Not thus fair Venus helps her favour\u0027d knight, \n The queen of pleasures shares the toils of fight, \n Each danger wards, and constant in her care, \n Saves in the moment of the last despair. \n Her act has rescued Paris\u0027 forfeit life, \n Though great Atrides gain\u0027d the glorious strife. \n Then say, ye powers! what signal issue waits \n To crown this deed, and finish all the fates! \n [pg 068] \n Shall Heaven by peace the bleeding kingdoms spare, \n Or rouse the furies, and awake the war? \n Yet, would the gods for human good provide, \n Atrides soon might gain his beauteous bride, \n Still Priam\u0027s walls in peaceful honours grow, \n And through his gates the crowding nations flow.\" \n Thus while he spoke, the queen of heaven, enraged, \n And queen of war, in close consult engaged: \n Apart they sit, their deep designs employ, \n And meditate the future woes of Troy. \n Though secret anger swell\u0027d Minerva\u0027s breast, \n The prudent goddess yet her wrath suppress\u0027d; \n But Juno, impotent of passion, broke \n Her sullen silence, and with fury spoke: \n \n \n \"Shall then, O tyrant of the ethereal reign! \n My schemes, my labours, and my hopes be vain? \n Have I, for this, shook Ilion with alarms, \n Assembled nations, set two worlds in arms? \n To spread the war, I flew from shore to shore; \n The immortal coursers scarce the labour bore. \n At length ripe vengeance o\u0027er their heads impends, \n But Jove himself the faithless race defends. \n Loth as thou art to punish lawless lust, \n Not all the gods are partial and unjust.\" \n The sire whose thunder shakes the cloudy skies, \n Sighs from his inmost soul, and thus replies: \n \"Oh lasting rancour! oh insatiate hate \n To Phrygia\u0027s monarch, and the Phrygian state! \n What high offence has fired the wife of Jove? \n Can wretched mortals harm the powers above, \n [pg 069] \n That Troy, and Troy\u0027s whole race thou wouldst confound, \n And yon fair structures level with the ground! \n Haste, leave the skies, fulfil thy stern desire, \n Burst all her gates, and wrap her walls in fire! \n Let Priam bleed! if yet you thirst for more, \n Bleed all his sons, and Ilion float with gore: \n To boundless vengeance the wide realm be given, \n Till vast destruction glut the queen of heaven! \n So let it be, and Jove his peace enjoy,126 \n When heaven no longer hears the name of Troy. \n But should this arm prepare to wreak our hate \n On thy loved realms, whose guilt demands their fate; \n Presume not thou the lifted bolt to stay, \n Remember Troy, and give the vengeance way. \n For know, of all the numerous towns that rise \n Beneath the rolling sun and starry skies, \n Which gods have raised, or earth-born men enjoy, \n None stands so dear to Jove as sacred Troy. \n No mortals merit more distinguish\u0027d grace \n Than godlike Priam, or than Priam\u0027s race. \n Still to our name their hecatombs expire, \n And altars blaze with unextinguish\u0027d fire.\" \n At this the goddess rolled her radiant eyes, \n Then on the Thunderer fix\u0027d them, and replies: \n \"Three towns are Juno\u0027s on the Grecian plains, \n More dear than all the extended earth contains, \n Mycenae, Argos, and the Spartan wall;127 \n These thou mayst raze, nor I forbid their fall: \n \u0027Tis not in me the vengeance to remove; \n The crime\u0027s sufficient that they share my love. \n Of power superior why should I complain? \n Resent I may, but must resent in vain. \n Yet some distinction Juno might require, \n Sprung with thyself from one celestial sire, \n A goddess born, to share the realms above, \n And styled the consort of the thundering Jove; \n Nor thou a wife and sister\u0027s right deny;128 \n Let both consent, and both by terms comply; \n So shall the gods our joint decrees obey, \n And heaven shall act as we direct the way. \n See ready Pallas waits thy high commands \n To raise in arms the Greek and Phrygian bands; \n [pg 070] \n Their sudden friendship by her arts may cease, \n And the proud Trojans first infringe the peace.\" \n The sire of men and monarch of the sky \n The advice approved, and bade Minerva fly, \n Dissolve the league, and all her arts employ \n To make the breach the faithless act of Troy. \n Fired with the charge, she headlong urged her flight, \n And shot like lightning from Olympus\u0027 height. \n As the red comet, from Saturnius sent \n To fright the nations with a dire portent, \n (A fatal sign to armies on the plain, \n Or trembling sailors on the wintry main,) \n With sweeping glories glides along in air, \n And shakes the sparkles from its blazing hair:129 \n Between both armies thus, in open sight \n Shot the bright goddess in a trail of light, \n With eyes erect the gazing hosts admire \n The power descending, and the heavens on fire! \n \"The gods (they cried), the gods this signal sent, \n And fate now labours with some vast event: \n Jove seals the league, or bloodier scenes prepares; \n Jove, the great arbiter of peace and wars.\" \n They said, while Pallas through the Trojan throng, \n (In shape a mortal,) pass\u0027d disguised along. \n Like bold Laodocus, her course she bent, \n Who from Antenor traced his high descent. \n Amidst the ranks Lycaon\u0027s son she found, \n The warlike Pandarus, for strength renown\u0027d; \n Whose squadrons, led from black ?sepus\u0027 flood,130 \n With flaming shields in martial circle stood. \n To him the goddess: \"Phrygian! canst thou hear \n A well-timed counsel with a willing ear? \n What praise were thine, couldst thou direct thy dart, \n Amidst his triumph, to the Spartan\u0027s heart? \n What gifts from Troy, from Paris wouldst thou gain, \n Thy country\u0027s foe, the Grecian glory slain? \n Then seize the occasion, dare the mighty deed, \n Aim at his breast, and may that aim succeed! \n But first, to speed the shaft, address thy vow \n To Lycian Phoebus with the silver bow, \n And swear the firstlings of thy flock to pay, \n On Zelia\u0027s altars, to the god of day.\"131 \n He heard, and madly at the motion pleased, \n [pg 071] \n His polish\u0027d bow with hasty rashness seized. \n \u0027Twas form\u0027d of horn, and smooth\u0027d with artful toil: \n A mountain goat resign\u0027d the shining spoil. \n Who pierced long since beneath his arrows bled; \n The stately quarry on the cliffs lay dead, \n And sixteen palms his brow\u0027s large honours spread: \n The workmen join\u0027d, and shaped the bended horns, \n And beaten gold each taper point adorns. \n This, by the Greeks unseen, the warrior bends, \n Screen\u0027d by the shields of his surrounding friends: \n There meditates the mark; and couching low, \n Fits the sharp arrow to the well-strung bow. \n One from a hundred feather\u0027d deaths he chose, \n Fated to wound, and cause of future woes; \n Then offers vows with hecatombs to crown \n Apollo\u0027s altars in his native town. \n Now with full force the yielding horn he bends, \n Drawn to an arch, and joins the doubling ends; \n Close to his breast he strains the nerve below, \n Till the barb\u0027d points approach the circling bow; \n The impatient weapon whizzes on the wing; \n Sounds the tough horn, and twangs the quivering string. \n But thee, Atrides! in that dangerous hour \n The gods forget not, nor thy guardian power, \n Pallas assists, and (weakened in its force) \n Diverts the weapon from its destined course: \n So from her babe, when slumber seals his eye, \n The watchful mother wafts the envenom\u0027d fly. \n Just where his belt with golden buckles join\u0027d, \n Where linen folds the double corslet lined, \n She turn\u0027d the shaft, which, hissing from above, \n Pass\u0027d the broad belt, and through the corslet drove; \n The folds it pierced, the plaited linen tore, \n And razed the skin, and drew the purple gore. \n As when some stately trappings are decreed \n To grace a monarch on his bounding steed, \n A nymph in Caria or Maeonia bred, \n Stains the pure ivory with a lively red; \n With equal lustre various colours vie, \n The shining whiteness, and the Tyrian dye: \n So great Atrides! show\u0027d thy sacred blood, \n As down thy snowy thigh distill\u0027d the streaming flood. \n With horror seized, the king of men descried \n The shaft infix\u0027d, and saw the gushing tide: \n Nor less the Spartan fear\u0027d, before he found \n The shining barb appear above the wound, \n Then, with a sigh, that heaved his manly breast, \n The royal brother thus his grief express\u0027d, \n And grasp\u0027d his hand; while all the Greeks around \n With answering sighs return\u0027d the plaintive sound. \n [pg 072] \n \"Oh, dear as life! did I for this agree \n The solemn truce, a fatal truce to thee! \n Wert thou exposed to all the hostile train, \n To fight for Greece, and conquer, to be slain! \n The race of Trojans in thy ruin join, \n And faith is scorn\u0027d by all the perjured line. \n Not thus our vows, confirm\u0027d with wine and gore, \n Those hands we plighted, and those oaths we swore, \n Shall all be vain: when Heaven\u0027s revenge is slow, \n Jove but prepares to strike the fiercer blow. \n The day shall come, that great avenging day, \n When Troy\u0027s proud glories in the dust shall lay, \n When Priam\u0027s powers and Priam\u0027s self shall fall, \n And one prodigious ruin swallow all. \n I see the god, already, from the pole \n Bare his red arm, and bid the thunder roll; \n I see the Eternal all his fury shed, \n And shake his aegis o\u0027er their guilty head. \n Such mighty woes on perjured princes wait; \n But thou, alas! deserv\u0027st a happier fate. \n Still must I mourn the period of thy days, \n And only mourn, without my share of praise? \n Deprived of thee, the heartless Greeks no more \n Shall dream of conquests on the hostile shore; \n Troy seized of Helen, and our glory lost, \n Thy bones shall moulder on a foreign coast; \n While some proud Trojan thus insulting cries, \n (And spurns the dust where Menelaus lies,) \n \u0027Such are the trophies Greece from Ilion brings, \n And such the conquest of her king of kings! \n Lo his proud vessels scatter\u0027d o\u0027er the main, \n And unrevenged, his mighty brother slain.\u0027 \n Oh! ere that dire disgrace shall blast my fame, \n O\u0027erwhelm me, earth! and hide a monarch\u0027s shame.\" \n He said: a leader\u0027s and a brother\u0027s fears \n Possess his soul, which thus the Spartan cheers: \n \"Let not thy words the warmth of Greece abate; \n The feeble dart is guiltless of my fate: \n Stiff with the rich embroider\u0027d work around, \n My varied belt repell\u0027d the flying wound.\" \n To whom the king: \"My brother and my friend, \n Thus, always thus, may Heaven thy life defend! \n Now seek some skilful hand, whose powerful art \n May stanch the effusion, and extract the dart. \n Herald, be swift, and bid Machaon bring \n His speedy succour to the Spartan king; \n Pierced with a winged shaft (the deed of Troy), \n The Grecian\u0027s sorrow, and the Dardan\u0027s joy.\" \n With hasty zeal the swift Talthybius flies; \n Through the thick files he darts his searching eyes, \n [pg 073] \n And finds Machaon, where sublime he stands132 \n In arms incircled with his native bands. \n Then thus: \"Machaon, to the king repair, \n His wounded brother claims thy timely care; \n Pierced by some Lycian or Dardanian bow, \n A grief to us, a triumph to the foe.\" \n The heavy tidings grieved the godlike man \n Swift to his succour through the ranks he ran. \n The dauntless king yet standing firm he found, \n And all the chiefs in deep concern around. \n Where to the steely point the reed was join\u0027d, \n The shaft he drew, but left the head behind. \n Straight the broad belt with gay embroidery graced, \n He loosed; the corslet from his breast unbraced; \n Then suck\u0027d the blood, and sovereign balm infused,133 \n Which Chiron gave, and ?sculapius used. \n While round the prince the Greeks employ their care, \n The Trojans rush tumultuous to the war; \n Once more they glitter in refulgent arms, \n Once more the fields are fill\u0027d with dire alarms. \n Nor had you seen the king of men appear \n Confused, unactive, or surprised with fear; \n But fond of glory, with severe delight, \n His beating bosom claim\u0027d the rising fight. \n No longer with his warlike steeds he stay\u0027d, \n Or press\u0027d the car with polish\u0027d brass inlaid \n But left Eurymedon the reins to guide; \n The fiery coursers snorted at his side. \n On foot through all the martial ranks he moves \n And these encourages, and those reproves. \n \"Brave men!\" he cries, (to such who boldly dare \n Urge their swift steeds to face the coming war), \n \"Your ancient valour on the foes approve; \n Jove is with Greece, and let us trust in Jove. \n [pg 074] \n \u0027Tis not for us, but guilty Troy, to dread, \n Whose crimes sit heavy on her perjured head; \n Her sons and matrons Greece shall lead in chains, \n And her dead warriors strew the mournful plains.\" \n Thus with new ardour he the brave inspires; \n Or thus the fearful with reproaches fires: \n \"Shame to your country, scandal of your kind; \n Born to the fate ye well deserve to find! \n Why stand ye gazing round the dreadful plain, \n Prepared for flight, but doom\u0027d to fly in vain? \n Confused and panting thus, the hunted deer \n Falls as he flies, a victim to his fear. \n Still must ye wait the foes, and still retire, \n Till yon tall vessels blaze with Trojan fire? \n Or trust ye, Jove a valiant foe shall chase, \n To save a trembling, heartless, dastard race?\" \n This said, he stalk\u0027d with ample strides along, \n To Crete\u0027s brave monarch and his martial throng; \n High at their head he saw the chief appear, \n And bold Meriones excite the rear. \n At this the king his generous joy express\u0027d, \n And clasp\u0027d the warrior to his armed breast. \n \"Divine Idomeneus! what thanks we owe \n To worth like thine! what praise shall we bestow? \n To thee the foremost honours are decreed, \n First in the fight and every graceful deed. \n For this, in banquets, when the generous bowls \n Restore our blood, and raise the warriors\u0027 souls, \n Though all the rest with stated rules we bound, \n Unmix\u0027d, unmeasured, are thy goblets crown\u0027d. \n Be still thyself, in arms a mighty name; \n Maintain thy honours, and enlarge thy fame.\" \n To whom the Cretan thus his speech address\u0027d: \n \"Secure of me, O king! exhort the rest. \n Fix\u0027d to thy side, in every toil I share, \n Thy firm associate in the day of war. \n But let the signal be this moment given; \n To mix in fight is all I ask of Heaven. \n The field shall prove how perjuries succeed, \n And chains or death avenge the impious deed.\" \n Charm\u0027d with this heat, the king his course pursues, \n And next the troops of either Ajax views: \n In one firm orb the bands were ranged around, \n A cloud of heroes blacken\u0027d all the ground. \n Thus from the lofty promontory\u0027s brow \n A swain surveys the gathering storm below; \n Slow from the main the heavy vapours rise, \n Spread in dim streams, and sail along the skies, \n Till black as night the swelling tempest shows, \n The cloud condensing as the west-wind blows: \n [pg 075] \n He dreads the impending storm, and drives his flock \n To the close covert of an arching rock. \n Such, and so thick, the embattled squadrons stood, \n With spears erect, a moving iron wood: \n A shady light was shot from glimmering shields, \n And their brown arms obscured the dusky fields. \n \"O heroes! worthy such a dauntless train, \n Whose godlike virtue we but urge in vain, \n (Exclaim\u0027d the king), who raise your eager bands \n With great examples, more than loud commands. \n Ah! would the gods but breathe in all the rest \n Such souls as burn in your exalted breast, \n Soon should our arms with just success be crown\u0027d, \n And Troy\u0027s proud walls lie smoking on the ground.\" \n Then to the next the general bends his course; \n (His heart exults, and glories in his force); \n There reverend Nestor ranks his Pylian bands, \n And with inspiring eloquence commands; \n With strictest order sets his train in arms, \n The chiefs advises, and the soldiers warms. \n Alastor, Chromius, Haemon, round him wait, \n Bias the good, and Pelagon the great. \n The horse and chariots to the front assign\u0027d, \n The foot (the strength of war) he ranged behind; \n The middle space suspected troops supply, \n Inclosed by both, nor left the power to fly; \n He gives command to \"curb the fiery steed, \n Nor cause confusion, nor the ranks exceed: \n Before the rest let none too rashly ride; \n No strength nor skill, but just in time, be tried: \n The charge once made, no warrior turn the rein, \n But fight, or fall; a firm embodied train. \n He whom the fortune of the field shall cast \n From forth his chariot, mount the next in haste; \n Nor seek unpractised to direct the car, \n Content with javelins to provoke the war. \n Our great forefathers held this prudent course, \n Thus ruled their ardour, thus preserved their force; \n By laws like these immortal conquests made, \n And earth\u0027s proud tyrants low in ashes laid.\" \n So spoke the master of the martial art, \n And touch\u0027d with transport great Atrides\u0027 heart. \n \"Oh! hadst thou strength to match thy brave desires, \n And nerves to second what thy soul inspires! \n But wasting years, that wither human race, \n Exhaust thy spirits, and thy arms unbrace. \n What once thou wert, oh ever mightst thou be! \n And age the lot of any chief but thee.\" \n Thus to the experienced prince Atrides cried; \n He shook his hoary locks, and thus replied: \n [pg 076] \n \"Well might I wish, could mortal wish renew134 \n That strength which once in boiling youth I knew; \n Such as I was, when Ereuthalion, slain \n Beneath this arm, fell prostrate on the plain. \n But heaven its gifts not all at once bestows, \n These years with wisdom crowns, with action those: \n The field of combat fits the young and bold, \n The solemn council best becomes the old: \n To you the glorious conflict I resign, \n Let sage advice, the palm of age, be mine.\" \n He said. With joy the monarch march\u0027d before, \n And found Menestheus on the dusty shore, \n With whom the firm Athenian phalanx stands; \n And next Ulysses, with his subject bands. \n Remote their forces lay, nor knew so far \n The peace infringed, nor heard the sounds of war; \n The tumult late begun, they stood intent \n To watch the motion, dubious of the event. \n The king, who saw their squadrons yet unmoved, \n With hasty ardour thus the chiefs reproved: \n \"Can Peleus\u0027 son forget a warrior\u0027s part. \n And fears Ulysses, skill\u0027d in every art? \n Why stand you distant, and the rest expect \n To mix in combat which yourselves neglect? \n From you \u0027twas hoped among the first to dare \n The shock of armies, and commence the war; \n For this your names are call\u0027d before the rest, \n To share the pleasures of the genial feast: \n And can you, chiefs! without a blush survey \n Whole troops before you labouring in the fray? \n Say, is it thus those honours you requite? \n The first in banquets, but the last in fight.\" \n Ulysses heard: the hero\u0027s warmth o\u0027erspread \n His cheek with blushes: and severe, he said: \n \"Take back the unjust reproach! Behold we stand \n Sheathed in bright arms, and but expect command. \n If glorious deeds afford thy soul delight, \n Behold me plunging in the thickest fight. \n Then give thy warrior-chief a warrior\u0027s due, \n Who dares to act whate\u0027er thou dar\u0027st to view.\" \n Struck with his generous wrath, the king replies: \n \"O great in action, and in council wise! \n With ours, thy care and ardour are the same, \n [pg 077] \n Nor need I to commend, nor aught to blame. \n Sage as thou art, and learn\u0027d in human kind, \n Forgive the transport of a martial mind. \n Haste to the fight, secure of just amends; \n The gods that make, shall keep the worthy, friends.\" \n He said, and pass\u0027d where great Tydides lay, \n His steeds and chariots wedged in firm array; \n (The warlike Sthenelus attends his side;)135 \n To whom with stern reproach the monarch cried: \n \"O son of Tydeus! (he, whose strength could tame \n The bounding steed, in arms a mighty name) \n Canst thou, remote, the mingling hosts descry, \n With hands unactive, and a careless eye? \n Not thus thy sire the fierce encounter fear\u0027d; \n Still first in front the matchless prince appear\u0027d: \n What glorious toils, what wonders they recite, \n Who view\u0027d him labouring through the ranks of fight? \n I saw him once, when gathering martial powers, \n A peaceful guest, he sought Mycenae\u0027s towers; \n Armies he ask\u0027d, and armies had been given, \n Not we denied, but Jove forbade from heaven; \n While dreadful comets glaring from afar, \n Forewarn\u0027d the horrors of the Theban war.136 \n Next, sent by Greece from where Asopus flows, \n A fearless envoy, he approach\u0027d the foes; \n Thebes\u0027 hostile walls unguarded and alone, \n Dauntless he enters, and demands the throne. \n The tyrant feasting with his chiefs he found, \n And dared to combat all those chiefs around: \n Dared, and subdued before their haughty lord; \n For Pallas strung his arm and edged his sword. \n Stung with the shame, within the winding way, \n To bar his passage fifty warriors lay; \n Two heroes led the secret squadron on, \n Mason the fierce, and hardy Lycophon; \n Those fifty slaughter\u0027d in the gloomy vale. \n He spared but one to bear the dreadful tale, \n Such Tydeus was, and such his martial fire; \n Gods! how the son degenerates from the sire!\" \n No words the godlike Diomed return\u0027d, \n But heard respectful, and in secret burn\u0027d: \n Not so fierce Capaneus\u0027 undaunted son; \n Stern as his sire, the boaster thus begun: \n \"What needs, O monarch! this invidious praise, \n Ourselves to lessen, while our sire you raise? \n Dare to be just, Atrides! and confess \n [pg 078] \n Our value equal, though our fury less. \n With fewer troops we storm\u0027d the Theban wall, \n And happier saw the sevenfold city fall,137 \n In impious acts the guilty father died; \n The sons subdued, for Heaven was on their side. \n Far more than heirs of all our parents\u0027 fame, \n Our glories darken their diminish\u0027d name.\" \n To him Tydides thus: \"My friend, forbear; \n Suppress thy passion, and the king revere: \n His high concern may well excuse this rage, \n Whose cause we follow, and whose war we wage: \n His the first praise, were Ilion\u0027s towers o\u0027erthrown, \n And, if we fail, the chief disgrace his own. \n Let him the Greeks to hardy toils excite, \n \u0027Tis ours to labour in the glorious fight.\" \n He spoke, and ardent, on the trembling ground \n Sprung from his car: his ringing arms resound. \n Dire was the clang, and dreadful from afar, \n Of arm\u0027d Tydides rushing to the war. \n As when the winds, ascending by degrees,138 \n First move the whitening surface of the seas, \n The billows float in order to the shore, \n The wave behind rolls on the wave before; \n Till, with the growing storm, the deeps arise, \n Foam o\u0027er the rocks, and thunder to the skies. \n So to the fight the thick battalions throng, \n Shields urged on shields, and men drove men along \n Sedate and silent move the numerous bands; \n No sound, no whisper, but the chief\u0027s commands, \n Those only heard; with awe the rest obey, \n As if some god had snatch\u0027d their voice away. \n Not so the Trojans; from their host ascends \n A general shout that all the region rends. \n As when the fleecy flocks unnumber\u0027d stand \n In wealthy folds, and wait the milker\u0027s hand, \n The hollow vales incessant bleating fills, \n The lambs reply from all the neighbouring hills: \n Such clamours rose from various nations round, \n Mix\u0027d was the murmur, and confused the sound. \n Each host now joins, and each a god inspires, \n These Mars incites, and those Minerva fires, \n Pale flight around, and dreadful terror reign; \n And discord raging bathes the purple plain; \n [pg 079] \n Discord! dire sister of the slaughtering power, \n Small at her birth, but rising every hour, \n While scarce the skies her horrid head can bound, \n She stalks on earth, and shakes the world around;139 \n The nations bleed, where\u0027er her steps she turns, \n The groan still deepens, and the combat burns. \n Now shield with shield, with helmet helmet closed, \n To armour armour, lance to lance opposed, \n Host against host with shadowy squadrons drew, \n The sounding darts in iron tempests flew, \n Victors and vanquish\u0027d join\u0027d promiscuous cries, \n And shrilling shouts and dying groans arise; \n With streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed, \n And slaughter\u0027d heroes swell the dreadful tide. \n As torrents roll, increased by numerous rills, \n With rage impetuous, down their echoing hills \n Rush to the vales, and pour\u0027d along the plain. \n Roar through a thousand channels to the main: \n The distant shepherd trembling hears the sound; \n So mix both hosts, and so their cries rebound. \n The bold Antilochus the slaughter led, \n The first who struck a valiant Trojan dead: \n At great Echepolus the lance arrives, \n Razed his high crest, and through his helmet drives; \n Warm\u0027d in the brain the brazen weapon lies, \n And shades eternal settle o\u0027er his eyes. \n So sinks a tower, that long assaults had stood \n Of force and fire, its walls besmear\u0027d with blood. \n Him, the bold leader of the Abantian throng,140 \n Seized to despoil, and dragg\u0027d the corpse along: \n But while he strove to tug the inserted dart, \n Agenor\u0027s javelin reach\u0027d the hero\u0027s heart. \n His flank, unguarded by his ample shield, \n Admits the lance: he falls, and spurns the field; \n The nerves, unbraced, support his limbs no more; \n The soul comes floating in a tide of gore. \n Trojans and Greeks now gather round the slain; \n The war renews, the warriors bleed again: \n As o\u0027er their prey rapacious wolves engage, \n Man dies on man, and all is blood and rage. \n In blooming youth fair Simoisius fell, \n Sent by great Ajax to the shades of hell; \n Fair Simoisius, whom his mother bore \n Amid the flocks on silver Simois\u0027 shore: \n The nymph descending from the hills of Ide, \n To seek her parents on his flowery side, \n [pg 080] \n Brought forth the babe, their common care and joy, \n And thence from Simois named the lovely boy. \n Short was his date! by dreadful Ajax slain, \n He falls, and renders all their cares in vain! \n So falls a poplar, that in watery ground \n Raised high the head, with stately branches crown\u0027d, \n (Fell\u0027d by some artist with his shining steel, \n To shape the circle of the bending wheel,) \n Cut down it lies, tall, smooth, and largely spread, \n With all its beauteous honours on its head \n There, left a subject to the wind and rain, \n And scorch\u0027d by suns, it withers on the plain \n Thus pierced by Ajax, Simoisius lies \n Stretch\u0027d on the shore, and thus neglected dies. \n At Ajax, Antiphus his javelin threw; \n The pointed lance with erring fury flew, \n And Leucus, loved by wise Ulysses, slew. \n He drops the corpse of Simoisius slain, \n And sinks a breathless carcase on the plain. \n This saw Ulysses, and with grief enraged, \n Strode where the foremost of the foes engaged; \n Arm\u0027d with his spear, he meditates the wound, \n In act to throw; but cautious look\u0027d around, \n Struck at his sight the Trojans backward drew, \n And trembling heard the javelin as it flew. \n A chief stood nigh, who from Abydos came, \n Old Priam\u0027s son, Democoon was his name. \n The weapon entered close above his ear, \n Cold through his temples glides the whizzing spear;141 \n With piercing shrieks the youth resigns his breath, \n His eye-balls darken with the shades of death; \n Ponderous he falls; his clanging arms resound, \n And his broad buckler rings against the ground. \n Seized with affright the boldest foes appear; \n E\u0027en godlike Hector seems himself to fear; \n Slow he gave way, the rest tumultuous fled; \n The Greeks with shouts press on, and spoil the dead: \n But Phoebus now from Ilion\u0027s towering height \n Shines forth reveal\u0027d, and animates the fight. \n \"Trojans, be bold, and force with force oppose; \n Your foaming steeds urge headlong on the foes! \n Nor are their bodies rocks, nor ribb\u0027d with steel; \n Your weapons enter, and your strokes they feel. \n Have ye forgot what seem\u0027d your dread before? \n The great, the fierce Achilles fights no more.\" \n Apollo thus from Ilion\u0027s lofty towers, \n Array\u0027d in terrors, roused the Trojan powers: \n While war\u0027s fierce goddess fires the Grecian foe, \n [pg 081] \n And shouts and thunders in the fields below. \n Then great Diores fell, by doom divine, \n In vain his valour and illustrious line. \n A broken rock the force of Pyrus threw, \n (Who from cold ?nus led the Thracian crew,)142 \n Full on his ankle dropp\u0027d the ponderous stone, \n Burst the strong nerves, and crash\u0027d the solid bone. \n Supine he tumbles on the crimson sands, \n Before his helpless friends, and native bands, \n And spreads for aid his unavailing hands. \n The foe rush\u0027d furious as he pants for breath, \n And through his navel drove the pointed death: \n His gushing entrails smoked upon the ground, \n And the warm life came issuing from the wound. \n His lance bold Thoas at the conqueror sent, \n Deep in his breast above the pap it went, \n Amid the lungs was fix\u0027d the winged wood, \n And quivering in his heaving bosom stood: \n Till from the dying chief, approaching near, \n The ?tolian warrior tugg\u0027d his weighty spear: \n Then sudden waved his flaming falchion round, \n And gash\u0027d his belly with a ghastly wound; \n The corpse now breathless on the bloody plain, \n To spoil his arms the victor strove in vain; \n The Thracian bands against the victor press\u0027d, \n A grove of lances glitter\u0027d at his breast. \n Stern Thoas, glaring with revengeful eyes, \n In sullen fury slowly quits the prize. \n Thus fell two heroes; one the pride of Thrace, \n And one the leader of the Epeian race; \n Death\u0027s sable shade at once o\u0027ercast their eyes, \n In dust the vanquish\u0027d and the victor lies. \n With copious slaughter all the fields are red, \n And heap\u0027d with growing mountains of the dead. \n Had some brave chief this martial scene beheld, \n By Pallas guarded through the dreadful field; \n Might darts be bid to turn their points away, \n And swords around him innocently play; \n The war\u0027s whole art with wonder had he seen, \n And counted heroes where he counted men. \n So fought each host, with thirst of glory fired, \n And crowds on crowds triumphantly expired. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1549/45991.html","bookId":1297,"book":{"id":1297,"title":"The Iliad of Homer 伊利亚特","description":"简介： 《伊利亚特》，或力量之诗 西蒙娜薇依Simone Weil著 吴雅凌译 《伊利亚特》的真正主角、真正主题和中心是力量。人类所操纵的力量，人类被制服的力量，在力量面前人的肉身一再缩退。在诗中，人的灵魂由于与力量的关系而不停产生变化，灵魂自以为拥有力量，却被力量所牵制...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/03/10-49-56-55-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1549","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:49 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:49 AM"}}
