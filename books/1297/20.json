Thetis, hearing his lamentations, comes with all her sea- nymphs to comfort him. The speeches of the mother and son on this occasion. Iris appears to Achilles by the command of Juno, and orders him to show himself at the head of the intrenchments. The sight of him turns the fortunes of the day, and the body of Patroclus is carried off by the Greeks. The Trojans call a council, where Hector and Polydamas disagree in their opinions: but the advice of the former prevails, to remain encamped in the field. The grief of Achilles over the body of Patroclus. \n \n Thetis goes to the palace of Vulcan to obtain new arms for her son. The description of the wonderful works of Vulcan: and, lastly, that noble one of the shield of Achilles. \n \n The latter part of the nine-and-twentieth day, and the night ensuing, take up this book: the scene is at Achilles\u0027 tent on the sea-shore, from whence it changes to the palace of Vulcan. \n Thus like the rage of fire the combat burns,250 \n And now it rises, now it sinks by turns. \n Meanwhile, where Hellespont\u0027s broad waters flow, \n Stood Nestor\u0027s son, the messenger of woe: \n There sat Achilles, shaded by his sails, \n On hoisted yards extended to the gales; \n Pensive he sat; for all that fate design\u0027d \n Rose in sad prospect to his boding mind. \n Thus to his soul he said: \"Ah! what constrains \n The Greeks, late victors, now to quit the plains? \n Is this the day, which heaven so long ago \n Ordain\u0027d, to sink me with the weight of woe? \n (So Thetis warn\u0027d;) when by a Trojan hand \n The bravest of the Myrmidonian band \n Should lose the light! Fulfilled is that decree; \n Fallen is the warrior, and Patroclus he! \n In vain I charged him soon to quit the plain, \n And warn\u0027d to shun Hectorean force in vain!\" \n [pg 332] \n Thus while he thinks, Antilochus appears, \n And tells the melancholy tale with tears. \n \"Sad tidings, son of Peleus! thou must hear; \n And wretched I, the unwilling messenger! \n Dead is Patroclus! For his corse they fight; \n His naked corse: his arms are Hector\u0027s right.\" \n A sudden horror shot through all the chief, \n And wrapp\u0027d his senses in the cloud of grief; \n Cast on the ground, with furious hands he spread \n The scorching ashes o\u0027er his graceful head; \n His purple garments, and his golden hairs, \n Those he deforms with dust, and these he tears; \n On the hard soil his groaning breast he threw, \n And roll\u0027d and grovell\u0027d, as to earth he grew. \n The virgin captives, with disorder\u0027d charms, \n (Won by his own, or by Patroclus\u0027 arms,) \n Rush\u0027d from their tents with cries; and gathering round, \n Beat their white breasts, and fainted on the ground: \n While Nestor\u0027s son sustains a manlier part, \n And mourns the warrior with a warrior\u0027s heart; \n Hangs on his arms, amidst his frantic woe, \n And oft prevents the meditated blow. \n Far in the deep abysses of the main,251 \n With hoary Nereus, and the watery train, \n The mother-goddess from her crystal throne \n Heard his loud cries, and answer\u0027d groan for groan. \n The circling Nereids with their mistress weep, \n And all the sea-green sisters of the deep. \n Thalia, Glauce (every watery name), \n Nesaea mild, and silver Spio came: \n Cymothoe and Cymodoce were nigh, \n And the blue languish of soft Alia\u0027s eye. \n Their locks Actaea and Limnoria rear, \n Then Proto, Doris, Panope appear, \n Thoa, Pherusa, Doto, Melita; \n Agave gentle, and Amphithoe gay: \n Next Callianira, Callianassa show \n Their sister looks; Dexamene the slow, \n And swift Dynamene, now cut the tides: \n Iaera now the verdant wave divides: \n Nemertes with Apseudes lifts the head, \n Bright Galatea quits her pearly bed; \n These Orythia, Clymene, attend, \n Maera, Amphinome, the train extend; \n And black Janira, and Janassa fair, \n And Amatheia with her amber hair. \n All these, and all that deep in ocean held \n Their sacred seats, the glimmering grotto fill\u0027d; \n [pg 333] \n Each beat her ivory breast with silent woe, \n Till Thetis\u0027 sorrows thus began to flow: \n \"Hear me, and judge, ye sisters of the main! \n How just a cause has Thetis to complain! \n How wretched, were I mortal, were my fate! \n How more than wretched in the immortal state! \n Sprung from my bed a godlike hero came, \n The bravest far that ever bore the name; \n Like some fair olive, by my careful hand \n He grew, he flourish\u0027d and adorn\u0027d the land \n To Troy I sent him: but the fates ordain \n He never, never must return again. \n So short a space the light of heaven to view, \n So short, alas! and fill\u0027d with anguish too! \n Hear how his sorrows echo through the shore! \n I cannot ease them, but I must deplore; \n I go at least to bear a tender part, \n And mourn my loved-one with a mother\u0027s heart.\" \n She said, and left the caverns of the main, \n All bathed in tears; the melancholy train \n Attend her way. Wide-opening part the tides, \n While the long pomp the silver wave divides. \n Approaching now, they touch\u0027d the Trojan land; \n Then, two by two, ascended up the strand. \n The immortal mother, standing close beside \n Her mournful offspring, to his sighs replied; \n Along the coast their mingled clamours ran, \n And thus the silver-footed dame began: \n \"Why mourns my son? thy late preferr\u0027d request \n The god has granted, and the Greeks distress\u0027d: \n Why mourns my son? thy anguish let me share, \n Reveal the cause, and trust a parent\u0027s care.\" \n He, deeply groaning—\"To this cureless grief, \n Not even the Thunderer\u0027s favour brings relief. \n Patroclus—Ah!—say, goddess, can I boast \n A pleasure now? revenge itself is lost; \n Patroclus, loved of all my martial train, \n Beyond mankind, beyond myself is slain! \n Lost are those arms the gods themselves bestow\u0027d \n On Peleus; Hector bears the glorious load. \n Cursed be that day, when all the powers above \n Thy charms submitted to a mortal love: \n O hadst thou still, a sister of the main, \n Pursued the pleasures of the watery reign: \n And happier Peleus, less ambitious, led \n A mortal beauty to his equal bed! \n Ere the sad fruit of thy unhappy womb \n Had caused such sorrows past, and woes to come. \n For soon, alas! that wretched offspring slain, \n New woes, new sorrows, shall create again. \n [pg 334] \n \u0027Tis not in fate the alternate now to give; \n Patroclus dead, Achilles hates to live. \n Let me revenge it on proud Hector\u0027s heart, \n Let his last spirit smoke upon my dart; \n On these conditions will I breathe: till then, \n I blush to walk among the race of men.\" \n A flood of tears, at this, the goddess shed: \n \"Ah then, I see thee dying, see thee dead! \n When Hector falls, thou diest.\"—\"Let Hector die, \n And let me fall! (Achilles made reply) \n Far lies Patroclus from his native plain! \n He fell, and falling, wish\u0027d my aid in vain. \n Ah then, since from this miserable day \n I cast all hope of my return away; \n Since, unrevenged, a hundred ghosts demand \n The fate of Hector from Achilles\u0027 hand; \n Since here, for brutal courage far renown\u0027d, \n I live an idle burden to the ground, \n (Others in council famed for nobler skill, \n More useful to preserve, than I to kill,) \n Let me—But oh! ye gracious powers above! \n Wrath and revenge from men and gods remove: \n Far, far too dear to every mortal breast, \n Sweet to the soul, as honey to the taste: \n Gathering like vapours of a noxious kind \n From fiery blood, and darkening all the mind. \n Me Agamemnon urged to deadly hate; \n \u0027Tis past—I quell it; I resign to fate. \n Yes—I will meet the murderer of my friend; \n Or (if the gods ordain it) meet my end. \n The stroke of fate the strongest cannot shun: \n The great Alcides, Jove\u0027s unequall\u0027d son, \n To Juno\u0027s hate, at length resign\u0027d his breath, \n And sunk the victim of all-conquering death. \n So shall Achilles fall! stretch\u0027d pale and dead, \n No more the Grecian hope, or Trojan dread! \n Let me, this instant, rush into the fields, \n And reap what glory life\u0027s short harvest yields. \n Shall I not force some widow\u0027d dame to tear \n With frantic hands her long dishevell\u0027d hair? \n Shall I not force her breast to heave with sighs, \n And the soft tears to trickle from her eyes? \n Yes, I shall give the fair those mournful charms— \n In vain you hold me—Hence! my arms! my arms!— \n Soon shall the sanguine torrent spread so wide, \n That all shall know Achilles swells the tide.\" \n \"My son (coerulean Thetis made reply, \n To fate submitting with a secret sigh,) \n The host to succour, and thy friends to save, \n Is worthy thee; the duty of the brave. \n [pg 335] \n But canst thou, naked, issue to the plains? \n Thy radiant arms the Trojan foe detains. \n Insulting Hector bears the spoils on high, \n But vainly glories, for his fate is nigh. \n Yet, yet awhile thy generous ardour stay; \n Assured, I meet thee at the dawn of day, \n Charged with refulgent arms (a glorious load), \n Vulcanian arms, the labour of a god.\" \n Then turning to the daughters of the main, \n The goddess thus dismiss\u0027d her azure train: \n \"Ye sister Nereids! to your deeps descend; \n Haste, and our father\u0027s sacred seat attend; \n I go to find the architect divine, \n Where vast Olympus\u0027 starry summits shine: \n So tell our hoary sire\"—This charge she gave: \n The sea-green sisters plunge beneath the wave: \n Thetis once more ascends the bless\u0027d abodes, \n And treads the brazen threshold of the gods. \n \n Illustration: THETIS ORDERING THE NEREIDS TO DESCEND INTO THE SEA. \n THETIS ORDERING THE NEREIDS TO DESCEND INTO THE SEA. \n And now the Greeks from furious Hector\u0027s force, \n Urge to broad Hellespont their headlong course; \n Nor yet their chiefs Patroclus\u0027 body bore \n Safe through the tempest to the tented shore. \n The horse, the foot, with equal fury join\u0027d, \n Pour\u0027d on the rear, and thunder\u0027d close behind: \n And like a flame through fields of ripen\u0027d corn, \n The rage of Hector o\u0027er the ranks was borne. \n Thrice the slain hero by the foot he drew; \n Thrice to the skies the Trojan clamours flew: \n As oft the Ajaces his assault sustain; \n [pg 336] \n But check\u0027d, he turns; repuls\u0027d, attacks again. \n With fiercer shouts his lingering troops he fires, \n Nor yields a step, nor from his post retires: \n So watchful shepherds strive to force, in vain, \n The hungry lion from a carcase slain. \n Even yet Patroclus had he borne away, \n And all the glories of the extended day, \n Had not high Juno from the realms of air, \n Secret, despatch\u0027d her trusty messenger. \n The various goddess of the showery bow, \n Shot in a whirlwind to the shore below; \n To great Achilles at his ships she came, \n And thus began the many-colour\u0027d dame: \n \"Rise, son of Peleus! rise, divinely brave! \n Assist the combat, and Patroclus save: \n For him the slaughter to the fleet they spread, \n And fall by mutual wounds around the dead. \n To drag him back to Troy the foe contends: \n Nor with his death the rage of Hector ends: \n A prey to dogs he dooms the corse to lie, \n And marks the place to fix his head on high. \n Rise, and prevent (if yet you think of fame) \n Thy friend\u0027s disgrace, thy own eternal shame!\" \n \"Who sends thee, goddess, from the ethereal skies?\" \n Achilles thus. And Iris thus replies: \n \"I come, Pelides! from the queen of Jove, \n The immortal empress of the realms above; \n Unknown to him who sits remote on high, \n Unknown to all the synod of the sky.\" \n \"Thou comest in vain (he cries, with fury warm\u0027d); \n Arms I have none, and can I fight unarm\u0027d? \n Unwilling as I am, of force I stay, \n Till Thetis bring me at the dawn of day \n Vulcanian arms: what other can I wield, \n Except the mighty Telamonian shield? \n That, in my friend\u0027s defence, has Ajax spread, \n While his strong lance around him heaps the dead: \n The gallant chief defends Menoetius\u0027 son, \n And does what his Achilles should have done.\" \n \"Thy want of arms (said Iris) well we know; \n But though unarm\u0027d, yet clad in terrors, go! \n Let but Achilles o\u0027er yon trench appear, \n Proud Troy shall tremble, and consent to fear; \n Greece from one glance of that tremendous eye \n Shall take new courage, and disdain to fly.\" \n She spoke, and pass\u0027d in air. The hero rose: \n Her aegis Pallas o\u0027er his shoulder throws; \n Around his brows a golden cloud she spread; \n A stream of glory flamed above his head. \n As when from some beleaguer\u0027d town arise \n [pg 337] \n The smokes, high curling to the shaded skies; \n (Seen from some island, o\u0027er the main afar, \n When men distress\u0027d hang out the sign of war;) \n Soon as the sun in ocean hides his rays, \n Thick on the hills the flaming beacons blaze; \n With long-projected beams the seas are bright, \n And heaven\u0027s high arch reflects the ruddy light: \n So from Achilles\u0027 head the splendours rise, \n Reflecting blaze on blaze against the skies. \n Forth march\u0027d the chief, and distant from the crowd, \n High on the rampart raised his voice aloud; \n With her own shout Minerva swells the sound; \n Troy starts astonish\u0027d, and the shores rebound. \n As the loud trumpet\u0027s brazen mouth from far \n With shrilling clangour sounds the alarm of war, \n Struck from the walls, the echoes float on high, \n And the round bulwarks and thick towers reply; \n So high his brazen voice the hero rear\u0027d: \n Hosts dropp\u0027d their arms, and trembled as they heard: \n And back the chariots roll, and coursers bound, \n And steeds and men lie mingled on the ground. \n Aghast they see the living lightnings play, \n And turn their eyeballs from the flashing ray. \n Thrice from the trench his dreadful voice he raised, \n And thrice they fled, confounded and amazed. \n Twelve in the tumult wedged, untimely rush\u0027d \n On their own spears, by their own chariots crush\u0027d: \n While, shielded from the darts, the Greeks obtain \n The long-contended carcase of the slain. \n A lofty bier the breathless warrior bears: \n Around, his sad companions melt in tears. \n But chief Achilles, bending down his head, \n Pours unavailing sorrows o\u0027er the dead, \n Whom late triumphant, with his steeds and car, \n He sent refulgent to the field of war; \n (Unhappy change!) now senseless, pale, he found, \n Stretch\u0027d forth, and gash\u0027d with many a gaping wound. \n Meantime, unwearied with his heavenly way, \n In ocean\u0027s waves the unwilling light of day \n Quench\u0027d his red orb, at Juno\u0027s high command, \n And from their labours eased the Achaian band. \n The frighted Trojans (panting from the war, \n Their steeds unharness\u0027d from the weary car) \n A sudden council call\u0027d: each chief appear\u0027d \n In haste, and standing; for to sit they fear\u0027d. \n \u0027Twas now no season for prolong\u0027d debate; \n They saw Achilles, and in him their fate. \n Silent they stood: Polydamas at last, \n Skill\u0027d to discern the future by the past, \n The son of Panthus, thus express\u0027d his fears \n [pg 338] \n (The friend of Hector, and of equal years; \n The self-same night to both a being gave, \n One wise in council, one in action brave): \n \n Illustration: JUNO COMMANDING THE SUN TO SET. \n JUNO COMMANDING THE SUN TO SET. \n \"In free debate, my friends, your sentence speak; \n For me, I move, before the morning break, \n To raise our camp: too dangerous here our post, \n Far from Troy walls, and on a naked coast. \n I deem\u0027d not Greece so dreadful, while engaged \n In mutual feuds her king and hero raged; \n Then, while we hoped our armies might prevail \n We boldly camp\u0027d beside a thousand sail. \n I dread Pelides now: his rage of mind \n Not long continues to the shores confined, \n Nor to the fields, where long in equal fray \n Contending nations won and lost the day; \n For Troy, for Troy, shall henceforth be the strife, \n And the hard contest not for fame, but life. \n Haste then to Ilion, while the favouring night \n Detains these terrors, keeps that arm from fight. \n If but the morrow\u0027s sun behold us here, \n That arm, those terrors, we shall feel, not fear; \n And hearts that now disdain, shall leap with joy, \n If heaven permit them then to enter Troy. \n Let not my fatal prophecy be true, \n Nor what I tremble but to think, ensue. \n Whatever be our fate, yet let us try \n What force of thought and reason can supply; \n Let us on counsel for our guard depend; \n The town her gates and bulwarks shall defend. \n [pg 339] \n When morning dawns, our well-appointed powers, \n Array\u0027d in arms, shall line the lofty towers. \n Let the fierce hero, then, when fury calls, \n Vent his mad vengeance on our rocky walls, \n Or fetch a thousand circles round the plain, \n Till his spent coursers seek the fleet again: \n So may his rage be tired, and labour\u0027d down! \n And dogs shall tear him ere he sack the town.\" \n \"Return! (said Hector, fired with stern disdain) \n What! coop whole armies in our walls again? \n Was\u0027t not enough, ye valiant warriors, say, \n Nine years imprison\u0027d in those towers ye lay? \n Wide o\u0027er the world was Ilion famed of old \n For brass exhaustless, and for mines of gold: \n But while inglorious in her walls we stay\u0027d, \n Sunk were her treasures, and her stores decay\u0027d; \n The Phrygians now her scatter\u0027d spoils enjoy, \n And proud Maeonia wastes the fruits of Troy. \n Great Jove at length my arms to conquest calls, \n And shuts the Grecians in their wooden walls, \n Darest thou dispirit whom the gods incite? \n Flies any Trojan? I shall stop his flight. \n To better counsel then attention lend; \n Take due refreshment, and the watch attend. \n If there be one whose riches cost him care, \n Forth let him bring them for the troops to share; \n \u0027Tis better generously bestow\u0027d on those, \n Than left the plunder of our country\u0027s foes. \n Soon as the morn the purple orient warms, \n Fierce on yon navy will we pour our arms. \n If great Achilles rise in all his might, \n His be the danger: I shall stand the fight. \n Honour, ye gods! or let me gain or give; \n And live he glorious, whosoe\u0027er shall live! \n Mars is our common lord, alike to all; \n And oft the victor triumphs, but to fall.\" \n The shouting host in loud applauses join\u0027d; \n So Pallas robb\u0027d the many of their mind; \n To their own sense condemn\u0027d, and left to choose \n The worst advice, the better to refuse. \n While the long night extends her sable reign, \n Around Patroclus mourn\u0027d the Grecian train. \n Stern in superior grief Pelides stood; \n Those slaughtering arms, so used to bathe in blood, \n Now clasp his clay-cold limbs: then gushing start \n The tears, and sighs burst from his swelling heart. \n The lion thus, with dreadful anguish stung, \n Roars through the desert, and demands his young; \n When the grim savage, to his rifled den \n Too late returning, snuffs the track of men, \n [pg 340] \n And o\u0027er the vales and o\u0027er the forest bounds; \n His clamorous grief the bellowing wood resounds. \n So grieves Achilles; and, impetuous, vents \n To all his Myrmidons his loud laments. \n \"In what vain promise, gods! did I engage, \n When to console Menoetius\u0027 feeble age, \n I vowed his much-loved offspring to restore, \n Charged with rich spoils, to fair Opuntia\u0027s shore?252 \n But mighty Jove cuts short, with just disdain, \n The long, long views of poor designing man! \n One fate the warrior and the friend shall strike, \n And Troy\u0027s black sands must drink our blood alike: \n Me too a wretched mother shall deplore, \n An aged father never see me more! \n Yet, my Patroclus! yet a space I stay, \n Then swift pursue thee on the darksome way. \n Ere thy dear relics in the grave are laid, \n Shall Hector\u0027s head be offer\u0027d to thy shade; \n That, with his arms, shall hang before thy shrine; \n And twelve, the noblest of the Trojan line, \n Sacred to vengeance, by this hand expire; \n Their lives effused around thy flaming pyre. \n Thus let me lie till then! thus, closely press\u0027d, \n Bathe thy cold face, and sob upon thy breast! \n While Trojan captives here thy mourners stay, \n Weep all the night and murmur all the day: \n Spoils of my arms, and thine; when, wasting wide, \n Our swords kept time, and conquer\u0027d side by side.\" \n He spoke, and bade the sad attendants round \n Cleanse the pale corse, and wash each honour\u0027d wound. \n A massy caldron of stupendous frame \n They brought, and placed it o\u0027er the rising flame: \n Then heap\u0027d the lighted wood; the flame divides \n Beneath the vase, and climbs around the sides: \n In its wide womb they pour the rushing stream; \n The boiling water bubbles to the brim. \n The body then they bathe with pious toil, \n Embalm the wounds, anoint the limbs with oil, \n High on a bed of state extended laid, \n And decent cover\u0027d with a linen shade; \n Last o\u0027er the dead the milk-white veil they threw; \n That done, their sorrows and their sighs renew. \n Meanwhile to Juno, in the realms above, \n (His wife and sister,) spoke almighty Jove. \n \"At last thy will prevails: great Peleus\u0027 son \n Rises in arms: such grace thy Greeks have won. \n Say (for I know not), is their race divine, \n And thou the mother of that martial line?\" \n \"What words are these? (the imperial dame replies, \n [pg 341] \n While anger flash\u0027d from her majestic eyes) \n Succour like this a mortal arm might lend, \n And such success mere human wit attend: \n And shall not I, the second power above, \n Heaven\u0027s queen, and consort of the thundering Jove, \n Say, shall not I one nation\u0027s fate command, \n Not wreak my vengeance on one guilty land?\" \n \n Illustration: TRIPOD. \n TRIPOD. \n So they. Meanwhile the silver-footed dame \n Reach\u0027d the Vulcanian dome, eternal frame! \n High-eminent amid the works divine, \n Where heaven\u0027s far-beaming brazen mansions shine. \n There the lame architect the goddess found, \n Obscure in smoke, his forges flaming round, \n While bathed in sweat from fire to fire he flew; \n And puffing loud, the roaring billows blew. \n That day no common task his labour claim\u0027d: \n Full twenty tripods for his hall he framed, \n That placed on living wheels of massy gold, \n (Wondrous to tell,) instinct with spirit roll\u0027d \n From place to place, around the bless\u0027d abodes \n Self-moved, obedient to the beck of gods: \n For their fair handles now, o\u0027erwrought with flowers, \n In moulds prepared, the glowing ore he pours. \n Just as responsive to his thought the frame \n Stood prompt to move, the azure goddess came: \n Charis, his spouse, a grace divinely fair, \n (With purple fillets round her braided hair,) \n Observed her entering; her soft hand she press\u0027d, \n And, smiling, thus the watery queen address\u0027d: \n \"What, goddess! this unusual favour draws? \n All hail, and welcome! whatsoe\u0027er the cause; \n [pg 342] \n Till now a stranger, in a happy hour \n Approach, and taste the dainties of the bower.\" \n \n Illustration: THETIS AND EURYNOME RECEIVING THE INFANT VULCAN. \n THETIS AND EURYNOME RECEIVING THE INFANT VULCAN. \n High on a throne, with stars of silver graced, \n And various artifice, the queen she placed; \n A footstool at her feet: then calling, said, \n \"Vulcan, draw near, \u0027tis Thetis asks your aid.\" \n \"Thetis (replied the god) our powers may claim, \n An ever-dear, an ever-honour\u0027d name! \n When my proud mother hurl\u0027d me from the sky, \n (My awkward form, it seems, displeased her eye,) \n She, and Eurynome, my griefs redress\u0027d, \n And soft received me on their silver breast. \n Even then these arts employ\u0027d my infant thought: \n Chains, bracelets, pendants, all their toys, I wrought. \n Nine years kept secret in the dark abode, \n Secure I lay, conceal\u0027d from man and god: \n Deep in a cavern\u0027d rock my days were led; \n The rushing ocean murmur\u0027d o\u0027er my head. \n Now, since her presence glads our mansion, say, \n For such desert what service can I pay? \n Vouchsafe, O Thetis! at our board to share \n The genial rites, and hospitable fare;

\n To whom was voice, and sense, and science given \n Of works divine (such wonders are in heaven!) \n On these supported, with unequal gait, \n He reach\u0027d the throne where pensive Thetis sate; \n There placed beside her on the shining frame, \n He thus address\u0027d the silver-footed dame: \n \"Thee, welcome, goddess! what occasion calls \n (So long a stranger) to these honour\u0027d walls? \n \u0027Tis thine, fair Thetis, the command to lay, \n And Vulcan\u0027s joy and duty to obey.\" \n \n Illustration: VULCAN AND CHARIS RECEIVING THETIS. \n VULCAN AND CHARIS RECEIVING THETIS. \n To whom the mournful mother thus replies: \n (The crystal drops stood trembling in her eyes:) \n \"O Vulcan! say, was ever breast divine \n So pierced with sorrows, so o\u0027erwhelm\u0027d as mine? \n Of all the goddesses, did Jove prepare \n For Thetis only such a weight of care? \n I, only I, of all the watery race \n By force subjected to a man\u0027s embrace, \n Who, sinking now with age and sorrow, pays \n The mighty fine imposed on length of days. \n Sprung from my bed, a godlike hero came, \n The bravest sure that ever bore the name; \n Like some fair plant beneath my careful hand \n He grew, he flourish\u0027d, and he graced the land: \n [pg 344] \n To Troy I sent him! but his native shore \n Never, ah never, shall receive him more; \n (Even while he lives, he wastes with secret woe;) \n Nor I, a goddess, can retard the blow! \n Robb\u0027d of the prize the Grecian suffrage gave, \n The king of nations forced his royal slave: \n For this he grieved; and, till the Greeks oppress\u0027d \n Required his arm, he sorrow\u0027d unredress\u0027d. \n Large gifts they promise, and their elders send; \n In vain—he arms not, but permits his friend \n His arms, his steeds, his forces to employ: \n He marches, combats, almost conquers Troy: \n Then slain by Phoebus (Hector had the name) \n At once resigns his armour, life, and fame. \n But thou, in pity, by my prayer be won: \n Grace with immortal arms this short-lived son, \n And to the field in martial pomp restore, \n To shine with glory, till he shines no more!\" \n To her the artist-god: \"Thy griefs resign, \n Secure, what Vulcan can, is ever thine. \n O could I hide him from the Fates, as well, \n Or with these hands the cruel stroke repel, \n As I shall forge most envied arms, the gaze \n Of wondering ages, and the world\u0027s amaze!\" \n Thus having said, the father of the fires \n To the black labours of his forge retires. \n Soon as he bade them blow, the bellows turn\u0027d \n Their iron mouths; and where the furnace burn\u0027d, \n Resounding breathed: at once the blast expires, \n And twenty forges catch at once the fires; \n Just as the god directs, now loud, now low, \n They raise a tempest, or they gently blow; \n In hissing flames huge silver bars are roll\u0027d, \n And stubborn brass, and tin, and solid gold; \n Before, deep fix\u0027d, the eternal anvils stand; \n The ponderous hammer loads his better hand, \n His left with tongs turns the vex\u0027d metal round, \n And thick, strong strokes, the doubling vaults rebound. \n Then first he form\u0027d the immense and solid shield; \n Rich various artifice emblazed the field; \n Its utmost verge a threefold circle bound;253 \n [pg 345] \n A silver chain suspends the massy round; \n Five ample plates the broad expanse compose, \n And godlike labours on the surface rose. \n There shone the image of the master-mind: \n There earth, there heaven, there ocean he design\u0027d; \n The unwearied sun, the moon completely round; \n The starry lights that heaven\u0027s high convex crown\u0027d; \n The Pleiads, Hyads, with the northern team; \n And great Orion\u0027s more refulgent beam; \n To which, around the axle of the sky, \n The Bear, revolving, points his golden eye, \n Still shines exalted on the ethereal plain, \n Nor bathes his blazing forehead in the main. \n Two cities radiant on the shield appear, \n The image one of peace, and one of war. \n Here sacred pomp and genial feast delight, \n And solemn dance, and hymeneal rite; \n Along the street the new-made brides are led, \n With torches flaming, to the nuptial bed: \n The youthful dancers in a circle bound \n To the soft flute, and cithern\u0027s silver sound: \n Through the fair streets the matrons in a row \n Stand in their porches, and enjoy the show. \n There in the forum swarm a numerous train; \n The subject of debate, a townsman slain: \n One pleads the fine discharged, which one denied, \n And bade the public and the laws decide: \n The witness is produced on either hand: \n For this, or that, the partial people stand: \n The appointed heralds still the noisy bands, \n And form a ring, with sceptres in their hands: \n On seats of stone, within the sacred place,254 \n The reverend elders nodded o\u0027er the case; \n Alternate, each the attesting sceptre took, \n And rising solemn, each his sentence spoke \n Two golden talents lay amidst, in sight, \n The prize of him who best adjudged the right. \n Another part (a prospect differing far)255 \n Glow\u0027d with refulgent arms, and horrid war. \n [pg 346] \n Two mighty hosts a leaguer\u0027d town embrace, \n And one would pillage, one would burn the place. \n Meantime the townsmen, arm\u0027d with silent care, \n A secret ambush on the foe prepare: \n Their wives, their children, and the watchful band \n Of trembling parents, on the turrets stand. \n They march; by Pallas and by Mars made bold: \n Gold were the gods, their radiant garments gold, \n And gold their armour: these the squadron led, \n August, divine, superior by the head! \n A place for ambush fit they found, and stood, \n Cover\u0027d with shields, beside a silver flood. \n Two spies at distance lurk, and watchful seem \n If sheep or oxen seek the winding stream. \n Soon the white flocks proceeded o\u0027er the plains, \n And steers slow-moving, and two shepherd swains; \n Behind them piping on their reeds they go, \n Nor fear an ambush, nor suspect a foe. \n In arms the glittering squadron rising round \n Rush sudden; hills of slaughter heap the ground; \n Whole flocks and herds lie bleeding on the plains, \n And, all amidst them, dead, the shepherd swains! \n The bellowing oxen the besiegers hear; \n They rise, take horse, approach, and meet the war, \n They fight, they fall, beside the silver flood; \n The waving silver seem\u0027d to blush with blood. \n There Tumult, there Contention stood confess\u0027d; \n One rear\u0027d a dagger at a captive\u0027s breast; \n One held a living foe, that freshly bled \n With new-made wounds; another dragg\u0027d a dead; \n Now here, now there, the carcases they tore: \n Fate stalk\u0027d amidst them, grim with human gore. \n And the whole war came out, and met the eye; \n And each bold figure seem\u0027d to live or die. \n A field deep furrow\u0027d next the god design\u0027d,256 \n [pg 347] \n The third time labour\u0027d by the sweating hind; \n The shining shares full many ploughmen guide, \n And turn their crooked yokes on every side. \n Still as at either end they wheel around, \n The master meets them with his goblet crown\u0027d; \n The hearty draught rewards, renews their toil, \n Then back the turning ploughshares cleave the soil: \n Behind, the rising earth in ridges roll\u0027d; \n And sable look\u0027d, though form\u0027d of molten gold. \n Another field rose high with waving grain; \n With bended sickles stand the reaper train: \n Here stretched in ranks the levell\u0027d swarths are found, \n Sheaves heap\u0027d on sheaves here thicken up the ground. \n With sweeping stroke the mowers strow the lands; \n The gatherers follow, and collect in bands; \n And last the children, in whose arms are borne \n (Too short to gripe them) the brown sheaves of corn. \n The rustic monarch of the field descries, \n With silent glee, the heaps around him rise. \n A ready banquet on the turf is laid, \n Beneath an ample oak\u0027s expanded shade. \n The victim ox the sturdy youth prepare; \n The reaper\u0027s due repast, the woman\u0027s care. \n Next, ripe in yellow gold, a vineyard shines, \n Bent with the ponderous harvest of its vines; \n A deeper dye the dangling clusters show, \n And curl\u0027d on silver props, in order glow: \n A darker metal mix\u0027d intrench\u0027d the place; \n And pales of glittering tin the inclosure grace. \n To this, one pathway gently winding leads, \n Where march a train with baskets on their heads, \n (Fair maids and blooming youths,) that smiling bear \n The purple product of the autumnal year. \n To these a youth awakes the warbling strings, \n Whose tender lay the fate of Linus sings; \n In measured dance behind him move the train, \n Tune soft the voice, and answer to the strain. \n Here herds of oxen march, erect and bold, \n Rear high their horns, and seem to low in gold, \n And speed to meadows on whose sounding shores \n A rapid torrent through the rushes roars: \n Four golden herdsmen as their guardians stand, \n And nine sour dogs complete the rustic band. \n Two lions rushing from the wood appear\u0027d; \n And seized a bull, the master of the herd: \n He roar\u0027d: in vain the dogs, the men withstood; \n They tore his flesh, and drank his sable blood. \n [pg 348] \n The dogs (oft cheer\u0027d in vain) desert the prey, \n Dread the grim terrors, and at distance bay. \n Next this, the eye the art of Vulcan leads \n Deep through fair forests, and a length of meads, \n And stalls, and folds, and scatter\u0027d cots between; \n And fleecy flocks, that whiten all the scene. \n A figured dance succeeds; such once was seen \n In lofty Gnossus for the Cretan queen, \n Form\u0027d by Daedalean art; a comely band \n Of youths and maidens, bounding hand in hand. \n The maids in soft simars of linen dress\u0027d; \n The youths all graceful in the glossy vest: \n Of those the locks with flowery wreath inroll\u0027d; \n Of these the sides adorn\u0027d with swords of gold, \n That glittering gay, from silver belts depend. \n Now all at once they rise, at once descend, \n With well-taught feet: now shape in oblique ways, \n Confusedly regular, the moving maze: \n Now forth at once, too swift for sight, they spring, \n And undistinguish\u0027d blend the flying ring: \n So whirls a wheel, in giddy circle toss\u0027d, \n And, rapid as it runs, the single spokes are lost. \n The gazing multitudes admire around: \n Two active tumblers in the centre bound; \n Now high, now low, their pliant limbs they bend: \n And general songs the sprightly revel end. \n Thus the broad shield complete the artist crown\u0027d \n With his last hand, and pour\u0027d the ocean round: \n In living silver seem\u0027d the waves to roll, \n And beat the buckler\u0027s verge, and bound the whole. \n This done, whate\u0027er a warrior\u0027s use requires \n He forged; the cuirass that outshone the fires, \n The greaves of ductile tin, the helm impress\u0027d \n With various sculpture, and the golden crest. \n At Thetis\u0027 feet the finished labour lay: \n She, as a falcon cuts the aerial way, \n Swift from Olympus\u0027 snowy summit flies, \n And bears the blazing present through the skies.257 \n [pg 349] \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n BOOK XIX. \n \n ARGUMENT. \n \n THE RECONCILIATION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON. \n \n Thetis brings to her son the armour made by Vulcan. She preserves the body of his friend from corruption, and commands him to assemble the army, to declare his resentment at an end. Agamemnon and Achilles are solemnly reconciled: the speeches, presents, and ceremonies on that occasion. Achilles is with great difficulty persuaded to refrain from the battle till the troops have refreshed themselves by the advice of Ulysses. The presents are conveyed to the tent of Achilles, where Briseis laments over the body of Patroclus. The hero obstinately refuses all repast, and gives himself up to lamentations for his friend. Minerva descends to strengthen him, by the order of Jupiter. He arms for the fight: his appearance described. He addresses himself to his horses, and reproaches them with the death of Patroclus. One of them is miraculously endued with voice, and inspired to prophesy his fate: but the hero, not astonished by that prodigy, rushes with fury to the combat. \n \n The thirteenth day. The scene is on the sea-shore. \n Soon as Aurora heaved her Orient head \n Above the waves, that blush\u0027d with early red, \n (With new-born day to gladden mortal sight, \n And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light,) \n The immortal arms the goddess-mother bears \n Swift to her son: her son she finds in tears \n Stretch\u0027d o\u0027er Patroclus\u0027 corse; while all the rest \n Their sovereign\u0027s sorrows in their own express\u0027d. \n A ray divine her heavenly presence shed, \n And thus, his hand soft touching, Thetis said: \n \"Suppress, my son, this rage of grief, and know \n It was not man, but heaven, that gave the blow; \n Behold what arms by Vulcan are bestow\u0027d, \n Arms worthy thee, or fit to grace a god.\" \n Then drops the radiant burden on the ground; \n Clang the strong arms, and ring the shores around; \n Back shrink the Myrmidons with dread surprise, \n And from the broad effulgence turn their eyes. \n Unmoved the hero kindles at the show, \n And feels with rage divine his bosom glow; \n [pg 350] \n From his fierce eyeballs living flames expire, \n And flash incessant like a stream of fire: \n He turns the radiant gift: and feeds his mind \n On all the immortal artist had design\u0027d. \n \"Goddess! (he cried,) these glorious arms, that shine \n With matchless art, confess the hand divine. \n Now to the bloody battle let me bend: \n But ah! the relics of my slaughter\u0027d friend! \n In those wide wounds through which his spirit fled, \n Shall flies, and worms obscene, pollute the dead?\" \n \"That unavailing care be laid aside, \n (The azure goddess to her son replied,) \n Whole years untouch\u0027d, uninjured shall remain, \n Fresh as in life, the carcase of the slain. \n But go, Achilles, as affairs require, \n Before the Grecian peers renounce thine ire: \n Then uncontroll\u0027d in boundless war engage, \n And heaven with strength supply the mighty rage!\" \n \n Illustration: THETIS BRINGING THE ARMOUR TO ACHILLES. \n THETIS BRINGING THE ARMOUR TO ACHILLES. \n Then in the nostrils of the slain she pour\u0027d \n Nectareous drops, and rich ambrosia shower\u0027d \n O\u0027er all the corse. The flies forbid their prey, \n Untouch\u0027d it rests, and sacred from decay. \n Achilles to the strand obedient went: \n The shores resounded with the voice he sent. \n The heroes heard, and all the naval train \n That tend the ships, or guide them o\u0027er the main, \n Alarm\u0027d, transported, at the well-known sound, \n Frequent and full, the great assembly crown\u0027d; \n Studious to see the terror of the plain, \n Long lost to battle, shine in arms again. \n [pg 351] \n Tydides and Ulysses first appear, \n Lame with their wounds, and leaning on the spear; \n These on the sacred seats of council placed, \n The king of men, Atrides, came the last: \n He too sore wounded by Agenor\u0027s son. \n Achilles (rising in the midst) begun: \n \"O monarch! better far had been the fate \n Of thee, of me, of all the Grecian state, \n If (ere the day when by mad passion sway\u0027d, \n Rash we contended for the black-eyed maid) \n Preventing Dian had despatch\u0027d her dart, \n And shot the shining mischief to the heart! \n Then many a hero had not press\u0027d the shore, \n Nor Troy\u0027s glad fields been fatten\u0027d with our gore. \n Long, long shall Greece the woes we caused bewail, \n And sad posterity repeat the tale. \n But this, no more the subject of debate, \n Is past, forgotten, and resign\u0027d to fate. \n Why should, alas, a mortal man, as I, \n Burn with a fury that can never die? \n Here then my anger ends: let war succeed, \n And even as Greece has bled, let Ilion bleed. \n Now call the hosts, and try if in our sight \n Troy yet shall dare to camp a second night! \n I deem, their mightiest, when this arm he knows, \n Shall \u0027scape with transport, and with joy repose.\" \n He said: his finish\u0027d wrath with loud acclaim \n The Greeks accept, and shout Pelides\u0027 name. \n When thus, not rising from his lofty throne, \n In state unmoved, the king of men begun: \n \"Hear me, ye sons of Greece! with silence hear! \n And grant your monarch an impartial ear: \n Awhile your loud, untimely joy suspend, \n And let your rash, injurious clamours end: \n Unruly murmurs, or ill-timed applause, \n Wrong the best speaker, and the justest cause. \n Nor charge on me, ye Greeks, the dire debate: \n Know, angry Jove, and all-compelling Fate, \n With fell Erinnys, urged my wrath that day \n When from Achilles\u0027 arms I forced the prey. \n What then could I against the will of heaven? \n Not by myself, but vengeful Ate driven; \n She, Jove\u0027s dread daughter, fated to infest \n The race of mortals, enter\u0027d in my breast. \n Not on the ground that haughty fury treads, \n But prints her lofty footsteps on the heads \n Of mighty men; inflicting as she goes \n Long-festering wounds, inextricable woes! \n Of old, she stalk\u0027d amid the bright abodes; \n And Jove himself, the sire of men and gods, \n [pg 352] \n The world\u0027s great ruler, felt her venom\u0027d dart; \n Deceived by Juno\u0027s wiles, and female art: \n For when Alcmena\u0027s nine long months were run, \n And Jove expected his immortal son, \n To gods and goddesses the unruly joy \n He show\u0027d, and vaunted of his matchless boy: \n \u0027From us, (he said) this day an infant springs, \n Fated to rule, and born a king of kings.\u0027 \n Saturnia ask\u0027d an oath, to vouch the truth, \n And fix dominion on the favour\u0027d youth. \n The Thunderer, unsuspicious of the fraud, \n Pronounced those solemn words that bind a god. \n The joyful goddess, from Olympus\u0027 height, \n Swift to Achaian Argos bent her flight: \n Scarce seven moons gone, lay Sthenelus\u0027s wife; \n She push\u0027d her lingering infant into life: \n Her charms Alcmena\u0027s coming labours stay, \n And stop the babe, just issuing to the day. \n Then bids Saturnius bear his oath in mind; \n \u0027A youth (said she) of Jove\u0027s immortal kind \n Is this day born: from Sthenelus he springs, \n And claims thy promise to be king of kings.\u0027 \n Grief seized the Thunderer, by his oath engaged; \n Stung to the soul, he sorrow\u0027d, and he raged. \n From his ambrosial head, where perch\u0027d she sate, \n He snatch\u0027d the fury-goddess of debate, \n The dread, the irrevocable oath he swore, \n The immortal seats should ne\u0027er behold her more; \n And whirl\u0027d her headlong down, for ever driven \n From bright Olympus and the starry heaven: \n Thence on the nether world the fury fell; \n Ordain\u0027d with man\u0027s contentious race to dwell. \n Full oft the god his son\u0027s hard toils bemoan\u0027d, \n Cursed the dire fury, and in secret groan\u0027d.258 \n Even thus, like Jove himself, was I misled, \n While raging Hector heap\u0027d our camps with dead. \n What can the errors of my rage atone? \n My martial troops, my treasures are thy own: \n This instant from the navy shall be sent \n Whate\u0027er Ulysses promised at thy tent: \n But thou! appeased, propitious to our prayer, \n Resume thy arms, and shine again in war.\" \n \" O king of nations! whose superior sway \n [pg 353] \n (Returns Achilles) all our hosts obey! \n To keep or send the presents, be thy care; \n To us, \u0027tis equal: all we ask is war. \n While yet we talk, or but an instant shun \n The fight, our glorious work remains undone. \n Let every Greek, who sees my spear confound \n The Trojan ranks, and deal destruction round, \n With emulation, what I act survey, \n And learn from thence the business of the day. \n The son of Peleus thus; and thus replies \n The great in councils, Ithacus the wise: \n \"Though, godlike, thou art by no toils oppress\u0027d, \n At least our armies claim repast and rest: \n Long and laborious must the combat be, \n When by the gods inspired, and led by thee. \n Strength is derived from spirits and from blood, \n And those augment by generous wine and food: \n What boastful son of war, without that stay, \n Can last a hero through a single day? \n Courage may prompt; but, ebbing out his strength, \n Mere unsupported man must yield at length; \n Shrunk with dry famine, and with toils declined, \n The drooping body will desert the mind: \n But built anew with strength-conferring fare, \n With limbs and soul untamed, he tires a war. \n Dismiss the people, then, and give command. \n With strong repast to hearten every band; \n But let the presents to Achilles made, \n In full assembly of all Greece be laid. \n The king of men shall rise in public sight, \n And solemn swear (observant of the rite) \n That, spotless, as she came, the maid removes, \n Pure from his arms, and guiltless of his loves. \n That done, a sumptuous banquet shall be made, \n And the full price of injured honour paid. \n Stretch not henceforth, O prince.! thy sovereign might \n Beyond the bounds of reason and of right; \n \u0027Tis the chief praise that e\u0027er to kings belong\u0027d, \n To right with justice whom with power they wrong\u0027d.\" \n To him the monarch: \"Just is thy decree, \n Thy words give joy, and wisdom breathes in thee. \n Each due atonement gladly I prepare; \n And heaven regard me as I justly swear! \n Here then awhile let Greece assembled stay, \n Nor great Achilles grudge this short delay. \n Till from the fleet our presents be convey\u0027d, \n And Jove attesting, the firm compact made. \n A train of noble youths the charge shall bear; \n These to select, Ulysses, be thy care: \n In order rank\u0027d let all our gifts appear, \n [pg 354] \n And the fair train of captives close the rear: \n Talthybius shall the victim boar convey, \n Sacred to Jove, and yon bright orb of day.\" \n \"For this (the stern ?acides replies) \n Some less important season may suffice, \n When the stern fury of the war is o\u0027er, \n And wrath, extinguish\u0027d, burns my breast no more. \n By Hector slain, their faces to the sky, \n All grim with gaping wounds, our heroes lie: \n Those call to war! and might my voice incite, \n Now, now, this instant, shall commence the fight: \n Then, when the day\u0027s complete, let generous bowls, \n And copious banquets, glad your weary souls. \n Let not my palate know the taste of food, \n Till my insatiate rage be cloy\u0027d with blood: \n Pale lies my friend, with wounds disfigured o\u0027er, \n And his cold feet are pointed to the door. \n Revenge is all my soul! no meaner care, \n Interest, or thought, has room to harbour there; \n Destruction be my feast, and mortal wounds, \n And scenes of blood, and agonizing sounds.\" \n \"O first of Greeks, (Ulysses thus rejoin\u0027d,) \n The best and bravest of the warrior kind! \n Thy praise it is in dreadful camps to shine, \n But old experience and calm wisdom mine. \n Then hear my counsel, and to reason yield, \n The bravest soon are satiate of the field; \n Though vast the heaps that strow the crimson plain, \n The bloody harvest brings but little gain: \n The scale of conquest ever wavering lies, \n Great Jove but turns it, and the victor dies! \n The great, the bold, by thousands daily fall, \n And endless were the grief, to weep for all. \n Eternal sorrows what avails to shed? \n Greece honours not with solemn fasts the dead: \n Enough, when death demands the brave, to pay \n The tribute of a melancholy day. \n One chief with patience to the grave resign\u0027d, \n Our care devolves on others left behind. \n Let generous food supplies of strength produce, \n Let rising spirits flow from sprightly juice, \n Let their warm heads with scenes of battle glow, \n And pour new furies on the feebler foe. \n Yet a short interval, and none shall dare \n Expect a second summons to the war; \n Who waits for that, the dire effects shall find, \n If trembling in the ships he lags behind. \n Embodied, to the battle let us bend, \n And all at once on haughty Troy descend.\" \n And now the delegates Ulysses sent, \n [pg 355] \n To bear the presents from the royal tent: \n The sons of Nestor, Phyleus\u0027 valiant heir, \n Thias and Merion, thunderbolts of war, \n With Lycomedes of Creiontian strain, \n And Melanippus, form\u0027d the chosen train. \n Swift as the word was given, the youths obey\u0027d: \n Twice ten bright vases in the midst they laid; \n A row of six fair tripods then succeeds; \n And twice the number of high-bounding steeds: \n Seven captives next a lovely line compose; \n The eighth Briseis, like the blooming rose, \n Closed the bright band: great Ithacus, before, \n First of the train, the golden talents bore: \n The rest in public view the chiefs dispose, \n A splendid scene! then Agamemnon rose: \n The boar Talthybius held: the Grecian lord \n Drew the broad cutlass sheath\u0027d beside his sword: \n The stubborn bristles from the victim\u0027s brow \n He crops, and offering meditates his vow. \n His hands uplifted to the attesting skies, \n On heaven\u0027s broad marble roof were fixed his eyes. \n The solemn words a deep attention draw, \n And Greece around sat thrill\u0027d with sacred awe. \n \"Witness thou first! thou greatest power above, \n All-good, all-wise, and all-surveying Jove! \n And mother-earth, and heaven\u0027s revolving light, \n And ye, fell furies of the realms of night, \n Who rule the dead, and horrid woes prepare \n For perjured kings, and all who falsely swear! \n The black-eyed maid inviolate removes, \n Pure and unconscious of my manly loves. \n If this be false, heaven all its vengeance shed, \n And levell\u0027d thunder strike my guilty head!\" \n With that, his weapon deep inflicts the wound; \n The bleeding savage tumbles to the ground; \n The sacred herald rolls the victim slain \n (A feast for fish) into the foaming main. \n Then thus Achilles: \"Hear, ye Greeks! and know \n Whate\u0027er we feel, \u0027tis Jove inflicts the woe; \n Not else Atrides could our rage inflame, \n Nor from my arms, unwilling, force the dame. \n \u0027Twas Jove\u0027s high will alone, o\u0027erruling all, \n That doom\u0027d our strife, and doom\u0027d the Greeks to fall. \n Go then, ye chiefs! indulge the genial rite; \n Achilles waits ye, and expects the fight.\" \n The speedy council at his word adjourn\u0027d: \n To their black vessels all the Greeks return\u0027d. \n Achilles sought his tent. His train before \n March\u0027d onward, bending with the gifts they bore. \n Those in the tents the squires industrious spread: \n [pg 356] \n The foaming coursers to the stalls they led; \n To their new seats the female captives move \n Briseis, radiant as the queen of love, \n Slow as she pass\u0027d, beheld with sad survey \n Where, gash\u0027d with cruel wounds, Patroclus lay. \n Prone on the body fell the heavenly fair, \n Beat her sad breast, and tore her golden hair; \n All beautiful in grief, her humid eyes \n Shining with tears she lifts, and thus she cries: \n \"Ah, youth for ever dear, for ever kind, \n Once tender friend of my distracted mind! \n I left thee fresh in life, in beauty gay; \n Now find thee cold, inanimated clay! \n What woes my wretched race of life attend! \n Sorrows on sorrows, never doom\u0027d to end! \n The first loved consort of my virgin bed \n Before these eyes in fatal battle bled: \n My three brave brothers in one mournful day \n All trod the dark, irremeable way: \n Thy friendly hand uprear\u0027d me from the plain, \n And dried my sorrows for a husband slain; \n Achilles\u0027 care you promised I should prove, \n The first, the dearest partner of his love; \n That rites divine should ratify the band, \n And make me empress in his native land. \n Accept these grateful tears! for thee they flow, \n For thee, that ever felt another\u0027s woe!\" \n Her sister captives echoed groan for groan, \n Nor mourn\u0027d Patroclus\u0027 fortunes, but their own. \n The leaders press\u0027d the chief on every side; \n Unmoved he heard them, and with sighs denied. \n \"If yet Achilles have a friend, whose care \n Is bent to please him, this request forbear; \n Till yonder sun descend, ah, let me pay \n To grief and anguish one abstemious day.\" \n He spoke, and from the warriors turn\u0027d his face: \n Yet still the brother-kings of Atreus\u0027 race, \n Nestor, Idomeneus, Ulysses sage, \n And Phoenix, strive to calm his grief and rage: \n His rage they calm not, nor his grief control; \n He groans, he raves, he sorrows from his soul. \n \"Thou too, Patroclus! (thus his heart he vents) \n Once spread the inviting banquet in our tents: \n Thy sweet society, thy winning care, \n Once stay\u0027d Achilles, rushing to the war. \n But now, alas! to death\u0027s cold arms resign\u0027d, \n What banquet but revenge can glad my mind? \n What greater sorrow could afflict my breast, \n What more if hoary Peleus were deceased? \n Who now, perhaps, in Phthia dreads to hear \n [pg 357] \n His son\u0027s sad fate, and drops a tender tear. \n What more, should Neoptolemus the brave, \n My only offspring, sink into the grave? \n If yet that offspring lives; (I distant far, \n Of all neglectful, wage a hateful war.) \n I could not this, this cruel stroke attend; \n Fate claim\u0027d Achilles, but might spare his friend. \n I hoped Patroclus might survive, to rear \n My tender orphan with a parent\u0027s care, \n From Scyros\u0027 isle conduct him o\u0027er the main, \n And glad his eyes with his paternal reign, \n The lofty palace, and the large domain. \n For Peleus breathes no more the vital air; \n Or drags a wretched life of age and care, \n But till the news of my sad fate invades \n His hastening soul, and sinks him to the shades.\" \n Sighing he said: his grief the heroes join\u0027d, \n Each stole a tear for what he left behind. \n Their mingled grief the sire of heaven survey\u0027d, \n And thus with pity to his blue-eyed maid: \n \"Is then Achilles now no more thy care, \n And dost thou thus desert the great in war? \n Lo, where yon sails their canvas wings extend, \n All comfortless he sits, and wails his friend: \n Ere thirst and want his forces have oppress\u0027d, \n Haste and infuse ambrosia in his breast.\" \n He spoke; and sudden, at the word of Jove, \n Shot the descending goddess from above. \n So swift through ether the shrill harpy springs, \n The wide air floating to her ample wings, \n To great Achilles she her flight address\u0027d, \n And pour\u0027d divine ambrosia in his breast,259 \n With nectar sweet, (refection of the gods!) \n Then, swift ascending, sought the bright abodes. \n Now issued from the ships the warrior-train, \n And like a deluge pour\u0027d upon the plain. \n As when the piercing blasts of Boreas blow, \n And scatter o\u0027er the fields the driving snow; \n From dusky clouds the fleecy winter flies, \n Whose dazzling lustre whitens all the skies: \n So helms succeeding helms, so shields from shields, \n Catch the quick beams, and brighten all the fields; \n Broad glittering breastplates, spears with pointed rays, \n Mix in one stream, reflecting blaze on blaze; \n Thick beats the centre as the coursers bound; \n With splendour flame the skies, and laugh the fields around, \n [pg 358] \n Full in the midst, high-towering o\u0027er the rest, \n His limbs in arms divine Achilles dress\u0027d; \n Arms which the father of the fire bestow\u0027d, \n Forged on the eternal anvils of the god. \n Grief and revenge his furious heart inspire, \n His glowing eyeballs roll with living fire; \n He grinds his teeth, and furious with delay \n O\u0027erlooks the embattled host, and hopes the bloody day. \n The silver cuishes first his thighs infold; \n Then o\u0027er his breast was braced the hollow gold; \n The brazen sword a various baldric tied, \n That, starr\u0027d with gems, hung glittering at his side; \n And, like the moon, the broad refulgent shield \n Blazed with long rays, and gleam\u0027d athwart the field. \n So to night-wandering sailors, pale with fears, \n Wide o\u0027er the watery waste, a light appears, \n Which on the far-seen mountain blazing high, \n Streams from some lonely watch-tower to the sky: \n With mournful eyes they gaze, and gaze again; \n Loud howls the storm, and drives them o\u0027er the main. \n Next, his high head the helmet graced; behind \n The sweepy crest hung floating in the wind: \n Like the red star, that from his flaming hair \n Shakes down diseases, pestilence, and war; \n So stream\u0027d the golden honours from his head, \n Trembled the sparkling plumes, and the loose glories shed. \n The chief beholds himself with wondering eyes; \n His arms he poises, and his motions tries; \n Buoy\u0027d by some inward force, he seems to swim, \n And feels a pinion lifting every limb. \n And now he shakes his great paternal spear, \n Ponderous and huge, which not a Greek could rear, \n From Pelion\u0027s cloudy top an ash entire \n Old Chiron fell\u0027d, and shaped it for his sire; \n A spear which stern Achilles only wields, \n The death of heroes, and the dread of fields. \n Automedon and Alcimus prepare \n The immortal coursers, and the radiant car; \n (The silver traces sweeping at their side;) \n Their fiery mouths resplendent bridles tied; \n The ivory-studded reins, return\u0027d behind, \n Waved o\u0027er their backs, and to the chariot join\u0027d. \n The charioteer then whirl\u0027d the lash around, \n And swift ascended at one active bound. \n All bright in heavenly arms, above his squire \n Achilles mounts, and sets the field on fire; \n Not brighter Phoebus in the ethereal way \n Flames from his chariot, and restores the day. \n High o\u0027er the host, all terrible he stands, \n And thunders to his steeds these dread commands: \n [pg 359] \n \"Xanthus and Balius! of Podarges\u0027 strain, \n (Unless ye boast that heavenly race in vain,) \n Be swift, be mindful of the load ye bear, \n And learn to make your master more your care: \n Through falling squadrons bear my slaughtering sword, \n Nor, as ye left Patroclus, leave your lord.\" \n The generous Xanthus, as the words he said, \n Seem\u0027d sensible of woe, and droop\u0027d his head: \n Trembling he stood before the golden wain, \n And bow\u0027d to dust the honours of his mane. \n When, strange to tell! (so Juno will\u0027d) he broke \n Eternal silence, and portentous spoke. \n \"Achilles! yes! this day at least we bear \n Thy rage in safety through the files of war: \n But come it will, the fatal time must come, \n Not ours the fault, but God decrees thy doom. \n Not through our crime, or slowness in the course, \n Fell thy Patroclus, but by heavenly force; \n The bright far-shooting god who gilds the day \n (Confess\u0027d we saw him) tore his arms way. \n No—could our swiftness o\u0027er the winds prevail, \n Or beat the pinions of the western gale, \n All were in vain—the Fates thy death demand, \n Due to a mortal and immortal hand.\" \n Then ceased for ever, by the Furies tied, \n His fateful voice. The intrepid chief replied \n With unabated rage—\"So let it be! \n Portents and prodigies are lost on me. \n I know my fate: to die, to see no more \n My much-loved parents, and my native shore— \n Enough—when heaven ordains, I sink in night: \n Now perish Troy!\" He said, and rush\u0027d to fight. \n \n Illustration: HERCULES. \n HERCULES. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1549/46005.html","bookId":1297,"book":{"id":1297,"title":"The Iliad of Homer 伊利亚特","description":"简介： 《伊利亚特》，或力量之诗 西蒙娜薇依Simone Weil著 吴雅凌译 《伊利亚特》的真正主角、真正主题和中心是力量。人类所操纵的力量，人类被制服的力量，在力量面前人的肉身一再缩退。在诗中，人的灵魂由于与力量的关系而不停产生变化，灵魂自以为拥有力量，却被力量所牵制...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/03/10-49-56-55-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1549","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:49 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:49 AM"}}
