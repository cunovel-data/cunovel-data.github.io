Helenus, the chief augur of Troy, commands Hector to return to the city, in order to appoint a solemn procession of the queen and the Trojan matrons to the temple of Minerva, to entreat her to remove Diomed from the fight. The battle relaxing during the absence of Hector, Glaucus and Diomed have an interview between the two armies; where, coming to the knowledge, of the friendship and hospitality passed between their ancestors, they make exchange of their arms. Hector, having performed the orders of Helenus, prevails upon Paris to return to the battle, and, taking a tender leave of his wife Andromache, hastens again to the field. \n \n The scene is first in the field of battle, between the rivers Simois and Scamander, and then changes to Troy. \n Now heaven forsakes the fight: the immortals yield \n To human force and human skill the field: \n Dark showers of javelins fly from foes to foes; \n Now here, now there, the tide of combat flows; \n While Troy\u0027s famed streams, that bound the deathful plain \n On either side, run purple to the main. \n Great Ajax first to conquest led the way, \n Broke the thick ranks, and turn\u0027d the doubtful day. \n The Thracian Acamas his falchion found, \n And hew\u0027d the enormous giant to the ground; \n His thundering arm a deadly stroke impress\u0027d \n Where the black horse-hair nodded o\u0027er his crest; \n Fix\u0027d in his front the brazen weapon lies, \n And seals in endless shades his swimming eyes. \n Next Teuthras\u0027 son distain\u0027d the sands with blood, \n Axylus, hospitable, rich, and good: \n In fair Arisbe\u0027s walls (his native place)161 \n He held his seat! a friend to human race. \n Fast by the road, his ever-open door \n Obliged the wealthy, and relieved the poor. \n To stern Tydides now he falls a prey, \n No friend to guard him in the dreadful day! \n [pg 110] \n Breathless the good man fell, and by his side \n His faithful servant, old Calesius died. \n By great Euryalus was Dresus slain, \n And next he laid Opheltius on the plain. \n Two twins were near, bold, beautiful, and young, \n From a fair naiad and Bucolion sprung: \n (Laomedon\u0027s white flocks Bucolion fed, \n That monarch\u0027s first-born by a foreign bed; \n In secret woods he won the naiad\u0027s grace, \n And two fair infants crown\u0027d his strong embrace:) \n Here dead they lay in all their youthful charms; \n The ruthless victor stripp\u0027d their shining arms. \n Astyalus by Polypoetes fell; \n Ulysses\u0027 spear Pidytes sent to hell; \n By Teucer\u0027s shaft brave Aretaon bled, \n And Nestor\u0027s son laid stern Ablerus dead; \n Great Agamemnon, leader of the brave, \n The mortal wound of rich Elatus gave, \n Who held in Pedasus his proud abode,162 \n And till\u0027d the banks where silver Satnio flow\u0027d. \n Melanthius by Eurypylus was slain; \n And Phylacus from Leitus flies in vain. \n Unbless\u0027d Adrastus next at mercy lies \n Beneath the Spartan spear, a living prize. \n Scared with the din and tumult of the fight, \n His headlong steeds, precipitate in flight, \n Rush\u0027d on a tamarisk\u0027s strong trunk, and broke \n The shatter\u0027d chariot from the crooked yoke; \n Wide o\u0027er the field, resistless as the wind, \n For Troy they fly, and leave their lord behind. \n Prone on his face he sinks beside the wheel: \n Atrides o\u0027er him shakes his vengeful steel; \n The fallen chief in suppliant posture press\u0027d \n The victor\u0027s knees, and thus his prayer address\u0027d: \n \"O spare my youth, and for the life I owe \n Large gifts of price my father shall bestow. \n When fame shall tell, that, not in battle slain, \n Thy hollow ships his captive son detain: \n Rich heaps of brass shall in thy tent be told,163 \n And steel well-temper\u0027d, and persuasive gold.\" \n He said: compassion touch\u0027d the hero\u0027s heart \n He stood, suspended with the lifted dart: \n As pity pleaded for his vanquish\u0027d prize, \n [pg 111] \n Stern Agamemnon swift to vengeance flies, \n And, furious, thus: \"Oh impotent of mind!164 \n Shall these, shall these Atrides\u0027 mercy find? \n Well hast thou known proud Troy\u0027s perfidious land, \n And well her natives merit at thy hand! \n Not one of all the race, nor sex, nor age, \n Shall save a Trojan from our boundless rage: \n Ilion shall perish whole, and bury all; \n Her babes, her infants at the breast, shall fall;165 \n A dreadful lesson of exampled fate, \n To warn the nations, and to curb the great!\" \n The monarch spoke; the words, with warmth address\u0027d, \n To rigid justice steel\u0027d his brother\u0027s breast \n Fierce from his knees the hapless chief he thrust; \n The monarch\u0027s javelin stretch\u0027d him in the dust, \n Then pressing with his foot his panting heart, \n Forth from the slain he tugg\u0027d the reeking dart. \n Old Nestor saw, and roused the warrior\u0027s rage; \n \"Thus, heroes! thus the vigorous combat wage; \n No son of Mars descend, for servile gains, \n To touch the booty, while a foe remains. \n Behold yon glittering host, your future spoil! \n First gain the conquest, then reward the toil.\" \n And now had Greece eternal fame acquired, \n And frighted Troy within her walls, retired, \n Had not sage Helenus her state redress\u0027d, \n Taught by the gods that moved his sacred breast. \n Where Hector stood, with great ?neas join\u0027d, \n The seer reveal\u0027d the counsels of his mind: \n \"Ye generous chiefs! on whom the immortals lay \n The cares and glories of this doubtful day; \n On whom your aids, your country\u0027s hopes depend; \n Wise to consult, and active to defend! \n Here, at our gates, your brave efforts unite, \n Turn back the routed, and forbid the flight, \n Ere yet their wives\u0027 soft arms the cowards gain, \n The sport and insult of the hostile train. \n When your commands have hearten\u0027d every band, \n Ourselves, here fix\u0027d, will make the dangerous stand; \n Press\u0027d as we are, and sore of former fight, \n These straits demand our last remains of might. \n Meanwhile thou, Hector, to the town retire, \n [pg 112] \n And teach our mother what the gods require: \n Direct the queen to lead the assembled train \n Of Troy\u0027s chief matrons to Minerva\u0027s fane;166 \n Unbar the sacred gates, and seek the power, \n With offer\u0027d vows, in Ilion\u0027s topmost tower. \n The largest mantle her rich wardrobes hold, \n Most prized for art, and labour\u0027d o\u0027er with gold, \n Before the goddess\u0027 honour\u0027d knees be spread, \n And twelve young heifers to her altars led: \n If so the power, atoned by fervent prayer, \n Our wives, our infants, and our city spare, \n And far avert Tydides\u0027 wasteful ire, \n That mows whole troops, and makes all Troy retire; \n Not thus Achilles taught our hosts to dread, \n Sprung though he was from more than mortal bed; \n Not thus resistless ruled the stream of fight, \n In rage unbounded, and unmatch\u0027d in might.\" \n Hector obedient heard: and, with a bound, \n Leap\u0027d from his trembling chariot to the ground; \n Through all his host inspiring force he flies, \n And bids the thunder of the battle rise. \n With rage recruited the bold Trojans glow, \n And turn the tide of conflict on the foe: \n Fierce in the front he shakes two dazzling spears; \n All Greece recedes, and \u0027midst her triumphs fears; \n Some god, they thought, who ruled the fate of wars, \n Shot down avenging from the vault of stars. \n Then thus aloud: \"Ye dauntless Dardans, hear! \n And you whom distant nations send to war! \n Be mindful of the strength your fathers bore; \n Be still yourselves, and Hector asks no more. \n One hour demands me in the Trojan wall, \n To bid our altars flame, and victims fall: \n Nor shall, I trust, the matrons\u0027 holy train, \n And reverend elders, seek the gods in vain.\" \n This said, with ample strides the hero pass\u0027d; \n The shield\u0027s large orb behind his shoulder cast, \n His neck o\u0027ershading, to his ankle hung; \n And as he march\u0027d the brazen buckler rung. \n Now paused the battle (godlike Hector gone),167 \n [pg 113] \n Where daring Glaucus and great Tydeus\u0027 son \n Between both armies met: the chiefs from far \n Observed each other, and had mark\u0027d for war. \n Near as they drew, Tydides thus began: \n \"What art thou, boldest of the race of man? \n Our eyes till now that aspect ne\u0027er beheld, \n Where fame is reap\u0027d amid the embattled field; \n Yet far before the troops thou dar\u0027st appear, \n And meet a lance the fiercest heroes fear. \n Unhappy they, and born of luckless sires, \n Who tempt our fury when Minerva fires! \n But if from heaven, celestial, thou descend, \n Know with immortals we no more contend. \n Not long Lycurgus view\u0027d the golden light, \n That daring man who mix\u0027d with gods in fight. \n Bacchus, and Bacchus\u0027 votaries, he drove, \n With brandish\u0027d steel, from Nyssa\u0027s sacred grove: \n Their consecrated spears lay scatter\u0027d round, \n With curling vines and twisted ivy bound; \n While Bacchus headlong sought the briny flood, \n And Thetis\u0027 arms received the trembling god. \n Nor fail\u0027d the crime the immortals\u0027 wrath to move; \n (The immortals bless\u0027d with endless ease above;) \n Deprived of sight by their avenging doom, \n Cheerless he breathed, and wander\u0027d in the gloom, \n Then sunk unpitied to the dire abodes, \n A wretch accursed, and hated by the gods! \n I brave not heaven: but if the fruits of earth \n Sustain thy life, and human be thy birth, \n Bold as thou art, too prodigal of breath, \n Approach, and enter the dark gates of death.\" \n \"What, or from whence I am, or who my sire, \n (Replied the chief,) can Tydeus\u0027 son inquire? \n Like leaves on trees the race of man is found, \n Now green in youth, now withering on the ground; \n Another race the following spring supplies; \n They fall successive, and successive rise: \n So generations in their course decay; \n So flourish these, when those are pass\u0027d away. \n But if thou still persist to search my birth, \n Then hear a tale that fills the spacious earth. \n \"A city stands on Argos\u0027 utmost bound, \n (Argos the fair, for warlike steeds renown\u0027d,) \n Aeolian Sisyphus, with wisdom bless\u0027d, \n In ancient time the happy wall possess\u0027d, \n Then call\u0027d Ephyre: Glaucus was his son; \n Great Glaucus, father of Bellerophon, \n Who o\u0027er the sons of men in beauty shined, \n [pg 114] \n Loved for that valour which preserves mankind. \n Then mighty Praetus Argos\u0027 sceptre sway\u0027d, \n Whose hard commands Bellerophon obey\u0027d. \n With direful jealousy the monarch raged, \n And the brave prince in numerous toils engaged. \n For him Antaea burn\u0027d with lawless flame, \n And strove to tempt him from the paths of fame: \n In vain she tempted the relentless youth, \n Endued with wisdom, sacred fear, and truth. \n Fired at his scorn the queen to Praetus fled, \n And begg\u0027d revenge for her insulted bed: \n Incensed he heard, resolving on his fate; \n But hospitable laws restrain\u0027d his hate: \n To Lycia the devoted youth he sent, \n With tablets seal\u0027d, that told his dire intent.168 \n Now bless\u0027d by every power who guards the good, \n The chief arrived at Xanthus\u0027 silver flood: \n There Lycia\u0027s monarch paid him honours due, \n Nine days he feasted, and nine bulls he slew. \n But when the tenth bright morning orient glow\u0027d, \n The faithful youth his monarch\u0027s mandate show\u0027d: \n The fatal tablets, till that instant seal\u0027d, \n The deathful secret to the king reveal\u0027d. \n First, dire Chimaera\u0027s conquest was enjoin\u0027d; \n A mingled monster of no mortal kind! \n Behind, a dragon\u0027s fiery tail was spread; \n A goat\u0027s rough body bore a lion\u0027s head; \n Her pitchy nostrils flaky flames expire; \n Her gaping throat emits infernal fire. \n \"This pest he slaughter\u0027d, (for he read the skies, \n And trusted heaven\u0027s informing prodigies,) \n Then met in arms the Solymaean crew,169 \n (Fiercest of men,) and those the warrior slew; \n Next the bold Amazons\u0027 whole force defied; \n And conquer\u0027d still, for heaven was on his side. \n \"Nor ended here his toils: his Lycian foes, \n At his return, a treacherous ambush rose, \n With levell\u0027d spears along the winding shore: \n There fell they breathless, and return\u0027d no more. \n \"At length the monarch, with repentant grief, \n Confess\u0027d the gods, and god-descended chief; \n His daughter gave, the stranger to detain, \n With half the honours of his ample reign: \n The Lycians grant a chosen space of ground, \n With woods, with vineyards, and with harvests crown\u0027d. \n There long the chief his happy lot possess\u0027d, \n With two brave sons and one fair daughter bless\u0027d; \n [pg 115] \n (Fair e\u0027en in heavenly eyes: her fruitful love \n Crown\u0027d with Sarpedon\u0027s birth the embrace of Jove;) \n But when at last, distracted in his mind, \n Forsook by heaven, forsaking humankind, \n Wide o\u0027er the Aleian field he chose to stray, \n A long, forlorn, uncomfortable way!170 \n Woes heap\u0027d on woes consumed his wasted heart: \n His beauteous daughter fell by Phoebe\u0027s dart; \n His eldest born by raging Mars was slain, \n In combat on the Solymaean plain. \n Hippolochus survived: from him I came, \n The honour\u0027d author of my birth and name; \n By his decree I sought the Trojan town; \n By his instructions learn to win renown, \n To stand the first in worth as in command, \n To add new honours to my native land, \n Before my eyes my mighty sires to place, \n And emulate the glories of our race.\" \n He spoke, and transport fill\u0027d Tydides\u0027 heart; \n In earth the generous warrior fix\u0027d his dart, \n Then friendly, thus the Lycian prince address\u0027d: \n \"Welcome, my brave hereditary guest! \n Thus ever let us meet, with kind embrace, \n Nor stain the sacred friendship of our race. \n Know, chief, our grandsires have been guests of old; \n OEneus the strong, Bellerophon the bold: \n Our ancient seat his honour\u0027d presence graced, \n Where twenty days in genial rites he pass\u0027d. \n The parting heroes mutual presents left; \n A golden goblet was thy grandsire\u0027s gift; \n OEneus a belt of matchless work bestowed, \n That rich with Tyrian dye refulgent glow\u0027d. \n (This from his pledge I learn\u0027d, which, safely stored \n Among my treasures, still adorns my board: \n For Tydeus left me young, when Thebe\u0027s wall \n Beheld the sons of Greece untimely fall.) \n Mindful of this, in friendship let us join; \n If heaven our steps to foreign lands incline, \n My guest in Argos thou, and I in Lycia thine. \n Enough of Trojans to this lance shall yield, \n In the full harvest of yon ample field; \n Enough of Greeks shall dye thy spear with gore; \n But thou and Diomed be foes no more. \n Now change we arms, and prove to either host \n We guard the friendship of the line we boast.\" \n Thus having said, the gallant chiefs alight, \n Their hands they join, their mutual faith they plight; \n [pg 116] \n Brave Glaucus then each narrow thought resign\u0027d, \n (Jove warm\u0027d his bosom, and enlarged his mind,) \n For Diomed\u0027s brass arms, of mean device, \n For which nine oxen paid, (a vulgar price,) \n He gave his own, of gold divinely wrought,171 \n A hundred beeves the shining purchase bought. \n Meantime the guardian of the Trojan state, \n Great Hector, enter\u0027d at the Scaean gate.172 \n Beneath the beech-tree\u0027s consecrated shades, \n The Trojan matrons and the Trojan maids \n Around him flock\u0027d, all press\u0027d with pious care \n For husbands, brothers, sons, engaged in war. \n He bids the train in long procession go, \n And seek the gods, to avert the impending woe. \n And now to Priam\u0027s stately courts he came, \n Rais\u0027d on arch\u0027d columns of stupendous frame; \n O\u0027er these a range of marble structure runs, \n The rich pavilions of his fifty sons, \n In fifty chambers lodged: and rooms of state,173 \n Opposed to those, where Priam\u0027s daughters sate. \n Twelve domes for them and their loved spouses shone, \n Of equal beauty, and of polish\u0027d stone. \n Hither great Hector pass\u0027d, nor pass\u0027d unseen \n Of royal Hecuba, his mother-queen. \n (With her Laodice, whose beauteous face \n Surpass\u0027d the nymphs of Troy\u0027s illustrious race.) \n Long in a strict embrace she held her son, \n And press\u0027d his hand, and tender thus begun: \n \"O Hector! say, what great occasion calls \n My son from fight, when Greece surrounds our walls; \n Com\u0027st thou to supplicate the almighty power \n With lifted hands, from Ilion\u0027s lofty tower? \n Stay, till I bring the cup with Bacchus crown\u0027d, \n In Jove\u0027s high name, to sprinkle on the ground, \n And pay due vows to all the gods around. \n Then with a plenteous draught refresh thy soul, \n And draw new spirits from the generous bowl; \n Spent as thou art with long laborious fight, \n The brave defender of thy country\u0027s right.\" \n \"Far hence be Bacchus\u0027 gifts; (the chief rejoin\u0027d;) \n Inflaming wine, pernicious to mankind, \n Unnerves the limbs, and dulls the noble mind. \n Let chiefs abstain, and spare the sacred juice \n To sprinkle to the gods, its better use. \n [pg 117] \n By me that holy office were profaned; \n Ill fits it me, with human gore distain\u0027d, \n To the pure skies these horrid hands to raise, \n Or offer heaven\u0027s great Sire polluted praise. \n You, with your matrons, go! a spotless train, \n And burn rich odours in Minerva\u0027s fane. \n The largest mantle your full wardrobes hold, \n Most prized for art, and labour\u0027d o\u0027er with gold, \n Before the goddess\u0027 honour\u0027d knees be spread, \n And twelve young heifers to her altar led. \n So may the power, atoned by fervent prayer, \n Our wives, our infants, and our city spare; \n And far avert Tydides\u0027 wasteful ire, \n Who mows whole troops, and makes all Troy retire. \n Be this, O mother, your religious care: \n I go to rouse soft Paris to the war; \n If yet not lost to all the sense of shame, \n The recreant warrior hear the voice of fame. \n Oh, would kind earth the hateful wretch embrace, \n That pest of Troy, that ruin of our race!174 \n Deep to the dark abyss might he descend, \n Troy yet should flourish, and my sorrows end.\" \n This heard, she gave command: and summon\u0027d came \n Each noble matron and illustrious dame. \n The Phrygian queen to her rich wardrobe went, \n Where treasured odours breathed a costly scent. \n There lay the vestures of no vulgar art, \n Sidonian maids embroider\u0027d every part, \n Whom from soft Sidon youthful Paris bore, \n With Helen touching on the Tyrian shore. \n Here, as the queen revolved with careful eyes \n The various textures and the various dyes, \n She chose a veil that shone superior far, \n And glow\u0027d refulgent as the morning star. \n Herself with this the long procession leads; \n The train majestically slow proceeds. \n Soon as to Ilion\u0027s topmost tower they come, \n And awful reach the high Palladian dome, \n Antenor\u0027s consort, fair Theano, waits \n As Pallas\u0027 priestess, and unbars the gates. \n With hands uplifted and imploring eyes, \n They fill the dome with supplicating cries. \n [pg 118] \n The priestess then the shining veil displays, \n Placed on Minerva\u0027s knees, and thus she prays: \n \"Oh awful goddess! ever-dreadful maid, \n Troy\u0027s strong defence, unconquer\u0027d Pallas, aid! \n Break thou Tydides\u0027 spear, and let him fall \n Prone on the dust before the Trojan wall! \n So twelve young heifers, guiltless of the yoke, \n Shall fill thy temple with a grateful smoke. \n But thou, atoned by penitence and prayer, \n Ourselves, our infants, and our city spare!\" \n So pray\u0027d the priestess in her holy fane; \n So vow\u0027d the matrons, but they vow\u0027d in vain. \n While these appear before the power with prayers, \n Hector to Paris\u0027 lofty dome repairs.175 \n Himself the mansion raised, from every part \n Assembling architects of matchless art. \n Near Priam\u0027s court and Hector\u0027s palace stands \n The pompous structure, and the town commands. \n A spear the hero bore of wondrous strength, \n Of full ten cubits was the lance\u0027s length, \n The steely point with golden ringlets join\u0027d, \n Before him brandish\u0027d, at each motion shined \n Thus entering, in the glittering rooms he found \n His brother-chief, whose useless arms lay round, \n His eyes delighting with their splendid show, \n Brightening the shield, and polishing the bow. \n Beside him Helen with her virgins stands, \n Guides their rich labours, and instructs their hands. \n Him thus inactive, with an ardent look \n The prince beheld, and high-resenting spoke. \n \"Thy hate to Troy, is this the time to show? \n (O wretch ill-fated, and thy country\u0027s foe!) \n Paris and Greece against us both conspire, \n Thy close resentment, and their vengeful ire. \n For thee great Ilion\u0027s guardian heroes fall, \n Till heaps of dead alone defend her wall, \n For thee the soldier bleeds, the matron mourns, \n And wasteful war in all its fury burns. \n Ungrateful man! deserves not this thy care, \n Our troops to hearten, and our toils to share? \n Rise, or behold the conquering flames ascend, \n And all the Phrygian glories at an end.\" \n \"Brother, \u0027tis just, (replied the beauteous youth,) \n [pg 119] \n Thy free remonstrance proves thy worth and truth: \n Yet charge my absence less, O generous chief! \n On hate to Troy, than conscious shame and grief: \n Here, hid from human eyes, thy brother sate, \n And mourn\u0027d, in secret, his and Ilion\u0027s fate. \n \u0027Tis now enough; now glory spreads her charms, \n And beauteous Helen calls her chief to arms. \n Conquest to-day my happier sword may bless, \n \u0027Tis man\u0027s to fight, but heaven\u0027s to give success. \n But while I arm, contain thy ardent mind; \n Or go, and Paris shall not lag behind.\" \n \n Illustration: HECTOR CHIDING PARIS. \n HECTOR CHIDING PARIS. \n He said, nor answer\u0027d Priam\u0027s warlike son; \n When Helen thus with lowly grace begun: \n \"Oh, generous brother! (if the guilty dame \n That caused these woes deserve a sister\u0027s name!) \n Would heaven, ere all these dreadful deeds were done, \n The day that show\u0027d me to the golden sun \n Had seen my death! why did not whirlwinds bear \n The fatal infant to the fowls of air? \n Why sunk I not beneath the whelming tide, \n And midst the roarings of the waters died? \n Heaven fill\u0027d up all my ills, and I accursed \n Bore all, and Paris of those ills the worst. \n Helen at least a braver spouse might claim, \n Warm\u0027d with some virtue, some regard of fame! \n Now tired with toils, thy fainting limbs recline, \n With toils, sustain\u0027d for Paris\u0027 sake and mine \n The gods have link\u0027d our miserable doom, \n Our present woe, and infamy to come: \n [pg 120] \n Wide shall it spread, and last through ages long, \n Example sad! and theme of future song.\" \n The chief replied: \"This time forbids to rest; \n The Trojan bands, by hostile fury press\u0027d, \n Demand their Hector, and his arm require; \n The combat urges, and my soul\u0027s on fire. \n Urge thou thy knight to march where glory calls, \n And timely join me, ere I leave the walls. \n Ere yet I mingle in the direful fray, \n My wife, my infant, claim a moment\u0027s stay; \n This day (perhaps the last that sees me here) \n Demands a parting word, a tender tear: \n This day, some god who hates our Trojan land \n May vanquish Hector by a Grecian hand.\" \n He said, and pass\u0027d with sad presaging heart \n To seek his spouse, his soul\u0027s far dearer part; \n At home he sought her, but he sought in vain; \n She, with one maid of all her menial train, \n Had hence retired; and with her second joy, \n The young Astyanax, the hope of Troy, \n Pensive she stood on Ilion\u0027s towery height, \n Beheld the war, and sicken\u0027d at the sight; \n There her sad eyes in vain her lord explore, \n Or weep the wounds her bleeding country bore. \n But he who found not whom his soul desired, \n Whose virtue charm\u0027d him as her beauty fired, \n Stood in the gates, and ask\u0027d \"what way she bent \n Her parting step? If to the fane she went, \n Where late the mourning matrons made resort; \n Or sought her sisters in the Trojan court?\" \n \"Not to the court, (replied the attendant train,) \n Nor mix\u0027d with matrons to Minerva\u0027s fane: \n To Ilion\u0027s steepy tower she bent her way, \n To mark the fortunes of the doubtful day. \n Troy fled, she heard, before the Grecian sword; \n She heard, and trembled for her absent lord: \n Distracted with surprise, she seem\u0027d to fly, \n Fear on her cheek, and sorrow m her eye. \n The nurse attended with her infant boy, \n The young Astyanax, the hope of Troy.\" \n Hector this heard, return\u0027d without delay; \n Swift through the town he trod his former way, \n Through streets of palaces, and walks of state; \n And met the mourner at the Scaean gate. \n With haste to meet him sprung the joyful fair. \n His blameless wife, Aetion\u0027s wealthy heir: \n (Cilician Thebe great Aetion sway\u0027d, \n And Hippoplacus\u0027 wide extended shade:) \n The nurse stood near, in whose embraces press\u0027d, \n His only hope hung smiling at her breast, \n [pg 121] \n Whom each soft charm and early grace adorn, \n Fair as the new-born star that gilds the morn. \n To this loved infant Hector gave the name \n Scamandrius, from Scamander\u0027s honour\u0027d stream; \n Astyanax the Trojans call\u0027d the boy, \n From his great father, the defence of Troy. \n Silent the warrior smiled, and pleased resign\u0027d \n To tender passions all his mighty mind; \n His beauteous princess cast a mournful look, \n Hung on his hand, and then dejected spoke; \n Her bosom laboured with a boding sigh, \n And the big tear stood trembling in her eye. \n \n Illustration: THE MEETING OF HECTOR AND ANDROMACHE. \n THE MEETING OF HECTOR AND ANDROMACHE. \n \"Too daring prince! ah, whither dost thou run? \n Ah, too forgetful of thy wife and son! \n And think\u0027st thou not how wretched we shall be, \n A widow I, a helpless orphan he? \n For sure such courage length of life denies, \n And thou must fall, thy virtue\u0027s sacrifice. \n Greece in her single heroes strove in vain; \n Now hosts oppose thee, and thou must be slain. \n O grant me, gods, ere Hector meets his doom, \n All I can ask of heaven, an early tomb! \n So shall my days in one sad tenor run, \n And end with sorrows as they first begun. \n No parent now remains my griefs to share, \n No father\u0027s aid, no mother\u0027s tender care. \n The fierce Achilles wrapt our walls in fire, \n Laid Thebe waste, and slew my warlike sire! \n [pg 122] \n His fate compassion in the victor bred; \n Stern as he was, he yet revered the dead, \n His radiant arms preserved from hostile spoil, \n And laid him decent on the funeral pile; \n Then raised a mountain where his bones were burn\u0027d, \n The mountain-nymphs the rural tomb adorn\u0027d, \n Jove\u0027s sylvan daughters bade their elms bestow \n A barren shade, and in his honour grow. \n \"By the same arm my seven brave brothers fell; \n In one sad day beheld the gates of hell; \n While the fat herds and snowy flocks they fed, \n Amid their fields the hapless heroes bled! \n My mother lived to wear the victor\u0027s bands, \n The queen of Hippoplacia\u0027s sylvan lands: \n Redeem\u0027d too late, she scarce beheld again \n Her pleasing empire and her native plain, \n When ah! oppress\u0027d by life-consuming woe, \n She fell a victim to Diana\u0027s bow. \n \"Yet while my Hector still survives, I see \n My father, mother, brethren, all, in thee: \n Alas! my parents, brothers, kindred, all \n Once more will perish, if my Hector fall, \n Thy wife, thy infant, in thy danger share: \n Oh, prove a husband\u0027s and a father\u0027s care! \n That quarter most the skilful Greeks annoy, \n Where yon wild fig-trees join the wall of Troy; \n Thou, from this tower defend the important post; \n There Agamemnon points his dreadful host, \n That pass Tydides, Ajax, strive to gain, \n And there the vengeful Spartan fires his train. \n Thrice our bold foes the fierce attack have given, \n Or led by hopes, or dictated from heaven. \n Let others in the field their arms employ, \n But stay my Hector here, and guard his Troy.\" \n The chief replied: \"That post shall be my care, \n Not that alone, but all the works of war. \n How would the sons of Troy, in arms renown\u0027d, \n And Troy\u0027s proud dames, whose garments sweep the ground \n Attaint the lustre of my former name, \n Should Hector basely quit the field of fame? \n My early youth was bred to martial pains, \n My soul impels me to the embattled plains! \n Let me be foremost to defend the throne, \n And guard my father\u0027s glories, and my own. \n \"Yet come it will, the day decreed by fates! \n (How my heart trembles while my tongue relates!) \n The day when thou, imperial Troy! must bend, \n And see thy warriors fall, thy glories end. \n And yet no dire presage so wounds my mind, \n My mother\u0027s death, the ruin of my kind, \n [pg 123] \n Not Priam\u0027s hoary hairs defiled with gore, \n Not all my brothers gasping on the shore; \n As thine, Andromache! Thy griefs I dread: \n I see thee trembling, weeping, captive led! \n In Argive looms our battles to design, \n And woes, of which so large a part was thine! \n To bear the victor\u0027s hard commands, or bring \n The weight of waters from Hyperia\u0027s spring. \n There while you groan beneath the load of life, \n They cry, \u0027Behold the mighty Hector\u0027s wife!\u0027 \n Some haughty Greek, who lives thy tears to see, \n Imbitters all thy woes, by naming me. \n The thoughts of glory past, and present shame, \n A thousand griefs shall waken at the name! \n May I lie cold before that dreadful day, \n Press\u0027d with a load of monumental clay! \n Thy Hector, wrapt in everlasting sleep, \n Shall neither hear thee sigh, nor see thee weep.\" \n Thus having spoke, the illustrious chief of Troy \n Stretch\u0027d his fond arms to clasp the lovely boy. \n The babe clung crying to his nurse\u0027s breast, \n Scared at the dazzling helm, and nodding crest. \n With secret pleasure each fond parent smiled, \n And Hector hasted to relieve his child, \n The glittering terrors from his brows unbound, \n And placed the beaming helmet on the ground; \n Then kiss\u0027d the child, and, lifting high in air, \n Thus to the gods preferr\u0027d a father\u0027s prayer: \n \"O thou! whose glory fills the ethereal throne, \n And all ye deathless powers! protect my son! \n Grant him, like me, to purchase just renown, \n To guard the Trojans, to defend the crown, \n Against his country\u0027s foes the war to wage, \n And rise the Hector of the future age! \n So when triumphant from successful toils \n Of heroes slain he bears the reeking spoils, \n Whole hosts may hail him with deserved acclaim, \n And say, \u0027This chief transcends his father\u0027s fame:\u0027 \n While pleased amidst the general shouts of Troy, \n His mother\u0027s conscious heart o\u0027erflows with joy.\" \n He spoke, and fondly gazing on her charms, \n Restored the pleasing burden to her arms; \n Soft on her fragrant breast the babe she laid, \n Hush\u0027d to repose, and with a smile survey\u0027d. \n The troubled pleasure soon chastised by fear, \n She mingled with a smile a tender tear. \n The soften\u0027d chief with kind compassion view\u0027d, \n And dried the falling drops, and thus pursued: \n \"Andromache! my soul\u0027s far better part, \n Why with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart? \n [pg 124] \n No hostile hand can antedate my doom, \n Till fate condemns me to the silent tomb. \n Fix\u0027d is the term to all the race of earth; \n And such the hard condition of our birth: \n No force can then resist, no flight can save, \n All sink alike, the fearful and the brave. \n No more—but hasten to thy tasks at home, \n There guide the spindle, and direct the loom: \n Me glory summons to the martial scene, \n The field of combat is the sphere for men. \n Where heroes war, the foremost place I claim, \n The first in danger as the first in fame.\" \n Thus having said, the glorious chief resumes \n His towery helmet, black with shading plumes. \n His princess parts with a prophetic sigh, \n Unwilling parts, and oft reverts her eye \n That stream\u0027d at every look; then, moving slow, \n Sought her own palace, and indulged her woe. \n There, while her tears deplored the godlike man, \n Through all her train the soft infection ran; \n The pious maids their mingled sorrows shed, \n And mourn the living Hector, as the dead. \n But now, no longer deaf to honour\u0027s call, \n Forth issues Paris from the palace wall. \n In brazen arms that cast a gleamy ray, \n Swift through the town the warrior bends his way. \n The wanton courser thus with reins unbound176 \n Breaks from his stall, and beats the trembling ground; \n Pamper\u0027d and proud, he seeks the wonted tides, \n And laves, in height of blood his shining sides; \n His head now freed, he tosses to the skies; \n His mane dishevell\u0027d o\u0027er his shoulders flies; \n He snuffs the females in the distant plain, \n And springs, exulting, to his fields again. \n With equal triumph, sprightly, bold, and gay, \n In arms refulgent as the god of day, \n The son of Priam, glorying in his might, \n Rush\u0027d forth with Hector to the fields of fight. \n And now, the warriors passing on the way, \n The graceful Paris first excused his stay. \n To whom the noble Hector thus replied: \n \"O chief! in blood, and now in arms, allied! \n Thy power in war with justice none contest; \n Known is thy courage, and thy strength confess\u0027d. \n What pity sloth should seize a soul so brave, \n [pg 125] \n Or godlike Paris live a woman\u0027s slave! \n My heart weeps blood at what the Trojans say, \n And hopes thy deeds shall wipe the stain away. \n Haste then, in all their glorious labours share, \n For much they suffer, for thy sake, in war. \n These ills shall cease, whene\u0027er by Jove\u0027s decree \n We crown the bowl to heaven and liberty: \n While the proud foe his frustrate triumphs mourns, \n And Greece indignant through her seas returns.\" \n \n Illustration: BOWS AND BOW CASE. \n BOWS AND BOW CASE. \n [pg 126] \n \n Illustration: IRIS. \n IRIS. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1549/45993.html","bookId":1297,"book":{"id":1297,"title":"The Iliad of Homer 伊利亚特","description":"简介： 《伊利亚特》，或力量之诗 西蒙娜薇依Simone Weil著 吴雅凌译 《伊利亚特》的真正主角、真正主题和中心是力量。人类所操纵的力量，人类被制服的力量，在力量面前人的肉身一再缩退。在诗中，人的灵魂由于与力量的关系而不停产生变化，灵魂自以为拥有力量，却被力量所牵制...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/03/10-49-56-55-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1549","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:49 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:49 AM"}}
