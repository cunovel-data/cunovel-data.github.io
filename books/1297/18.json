{"id":34780,"no":18,"title":"BOOK XVI.","content":"ARGUMENT \\n\\n \\n\\n THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS \\n\\n \\n\\n Patroclus (in pursuance of the request of Nestor in the eleventh book) entreats Achilles to suffer him to go to the assistance of the Greeks with Achilles\u0027 troops and armour. He agrees to it, but at the same time charges him to content himself with rescuing the fleet, without further pursuit of the enemy. The armour, horses, soldiers, and officers are described. Achilles offers a libation for the success of his friend, after which Patroclus leads the Myrmidons to battle. The Trojans, at the sight of Patroclus in Achilles\u0027 armour, taking him for that hero, are cast into the uttermost consternation; he beats them off from the vessels, Hector himself flies, Sarpedon is killed, though Jupiter was averse to his fate. Several other particulars of the battle are described; in the heat of which, Patroclus, neglecting the orders of Achilles, pursues the foe to the walls of Troy, where Apollo repulses and disarms him, Euphorbus wounds him, and Hector kills him, which concludes the book. \\n\\n So warr\u0027d both armies on the ensanguined shore, \\n\\n While the black vessels smoked with human gore. \\n\\n Meantime Patroclus to Achilles flies; \\n\\n The streaming tears fall copious from his eyes \\n\\n Not faster, trickling to the plains below, \\n\\n From the tall rock the sable waters flow. \\n\\n Divine Pelides, with compassion moved. \\n\\n Thus spoke, indulgent, to his best beloved:243 \\n\\n [pg 289] \\n\\n \"Patroclus, say, what grief thy bosom bears, \\n\\n That flows so fast in these unmanly tears? \\n\\n No girl, no infant whom the mother keeps \\n\\n From her loved breast, with fonder passion weeps; \\n\\n Not more the mother\u0027s soul, that infant warms, \\n\\n Clung to her knees, and reaching at her arms, \\n\\n Than thou hast mine! Oh tell me, to what end \\n\\n Thy melting sorrows thus pursue thy friend? \\n\\n \"Griev\u0027st thou for me, or for, my martial band? \\n\\n Or come sad tidings from our native land? \\n\\n Our fathers live (our first, most tender care), \\n\\n Thy good Menoetius breathes the vital air, \\n\\n And hoary Peleus yet extends his days; \\n\\n Pleased in their age to hear their children\u0027s praise. \\n\\n Or may some meaner cause thy pity claim? \\n\\n Perhaps yon relics of the Grecian name, \\n\\n Doom\u0027d in their ships to sink by fire and sword, \\n\\n And pay the forfeit of their haughty lord? \\n\\n Whate\u0027er the cause, reveal thy secret care, \\n\\n And speak those sorrows which a friend would share.\" \\n\\n A sigh that instant from his bosom broke, \\n\\n Another follow\u0027d, and Patroclus spoke: \\n\\n \"Let Greece at length with pity touch thy breast, \\n\\n Thyself a Greek; and, once, of Greeks the best! \\n\\n Lo! every chief that might her fate prevent, \\n\\n Lies pierced with wounds, and bleeding in his tent: \\n\\n Eurypylus, Tydides, Atreus\u0027 son, \\n\\n And wise Ulysses, at the navy groan, \\n\\n More for their country\u0027s wounds than for their own. \\n\\n Their pain soft arts of pharmacy can ease, \\n\\n Thy breast alone no lenitives appease. \\n\\n May never rage like thine my soul enslave, \\n\\n O great in vain! unprofitably brave! \\n\\n Thy country slighted in her last distress, \\n\\n What friend, what man, from thee shall hope redress? \\n\\n No—men unborn, and ages yet behind, \\n\\n Shall curse that fierce, that unforgiving mind. \\n\\n \"O man unpitying! if of man thy race; \\n\\n But sure thou spring\u0027st not from a soft embrace, \\n\\n Nor ever amorous hero caused thy birth, \\n\\n Nor ever tender goddess brought thee forth: \\n\\n Some rugged rock\u0027s hard entrails gave thee form, \\n\\n And raging seas produced thee in a storm, \\n\\n A soul well suiting that tempestuous kind, \\n\\n So rough thy manners, so untamed thy mind. \\n\\n [pg 290] \\n\\n \"If some dire oracle thy breast alarm, \\n\\n If aught from Jove, or Thetis, stop thy arm, \\n\\n Some beam of comfort yet on Greece may shine, \\n\\n If I but lead the Myrmidonian line: \\n\\n Clad in thy dreadful arms if I appear, \\n\\n Proud Troy shall tremble, and desert the war; \\n\\n Without thy person Greece shall win the day, \\n\\n And thy mere image chase her foes away. \\n\\n Press\u0027d by fresh forces, her o\u0027erlabour\u0027d train \\n\\n Shall quit the ships, and Greece respire again.\" \\n\\n Thus, blind to fate! with supplicating breath, \\n\\n Thou begg\u0027st his arms, and in his arms thy death. \\n\\n Unfortunately good! a boding sigh \\n\\n Thy friend return\u0027d; and with it, this reply: \\n\\n \"Patroclus! thy Achilles knows no fears; \\n\\n Nor words from Jove nor oracles he hears; \\n\\n Nor aught a mother\u0027s caution can suggest; \\n\\n The tyrant\u0027s pride lies rooted in my breast. \\n\\n My wrongs, my wrongs, my constant thought engage, \\n\\n Those, my sole oracles, inspire my rage: \\n\\n I made him tyrant: gave him power to wrong \\n\\n Even my: I felt it; and shall feel it long. \\n\\n The maid, my black-eyed maid, he forced away, \\n\\n Due to the toils of many a well-fought day; \\n\\n Due to my conquest of her father\u0027s reign; \\n\\n Due to the votes of all the Grecian train. \\n\\n From me he forced her; me, the bold and brave, \\n\\n Disgraced, dishonour\u0027d, like the meanest slave. \\n\\n But bear we this—the wrongs I grieve are past; \\n\\n \u0027Tis time our fury should relent at last: \\n\\n I fix\u0027d its date; the day I wish\u0027d appears: \\n\\n How Hector to my ships his battle bears, \\n\\n The flames my eyes, the shouts invade my ears. \\n\\n Go then, Patroclus! court fair honour\u0027s charms \\n\\n In Troy\u0027s famed fields, and in Achilles\u0027 arms: \\n\\n Lead forth my martial Myrmidons to fight, \\n\\n Go save the fleets, and conquer in my right. \\n\\n See the thin relics of their baffled band \\n\\n At the last edge of yon deserted land! \\n\\n Behold all Ilion on their ships descends; \\n\\n How the cloud blackens, how the storm impends! \\n\\n It was not thus, when, at my sight amazed, \\n\\n Troy saw and trembled, as this helmet blazed: \\n\\n Had not the injurious king our friendship lost, \\n\\n Yon ample trench had buried half her host. \\n\\n No camps, no bulwarks now the Trojans fear, \\n\\n Those are not dreadful, no Achilles there; \\n\\n No longer flames the lance of Tydeus\u0027 son; \\n\\n No more your general calls his heroes on: \\n\\n Hector, alone, I hear; his dreadful breath \\n\\n [pg 291] \\n\\n Commands your slaughter, or proclaims your death. \\n\\n Yet now, Patroclus, issue to the plain: \\n\\n Now save the ships, the rising fires restrain, \\n\\n And give the Greeks to visit Greece again. \\n\\n But heed my words, and mark a friend\u0027s command, \\n\\n Who trusts his fame and honours in thy hand, \\n\\n And from thy deeds expects the Achaian host \\n\\n Shall render back the beauteous maid he lost: \\n\\n Rage uncontroll\u0027d through all the hostile crew, \\n\\n But touch not Hector, Hector is my due. \\n\\n Though Jove in thunder should command the war, \\n\\n Be just, consult my glory, and forbear. \\n\\n The fleet once saved, desist from further chase, \\n\\n Nor lead to Ilion\u0027s walls the Grecian race; \\n\\n Some adverse god thy rashness may destroy; \\n\\n Some god, like Phoebus, ever kind to Troy. \\n\\n Let Greece, redeem\u0027d from this destructive strait, \\n\\n Do her own work; and leave the rest to fate. \\n\\n O! would to all the immortal powers above, \\n\\n Apollo, Pallas, and almighty Jove! \\n\\n That not one Trojan might be left alive, \\n\\n And not a Greek of all the race survive: \\n\\n Might only we the vast destruction shun, \\n\\n And only we destroy the accursed town!\" \\n\\n Such conference held the chiefs; while on the strand \\n\\n Great Jove with conquest crown\u0027d the Trojan band. \\n\\n Ajax no more the sounding storm sustain\u0027d, \\n\\n So thick the darts an iron tempest rain\u0027d: \\n\\n On his tired arm the weighty buckler hung; \\n\\n His hollow helm with falling javelins rung; \\n\\n His breath, in quick short pantings, comes and goes; \\n\\n And painful sweat from all his members flows. \\n\\n Spent and o\u0027erpower\u0027d, he barely breathes at most; \\n\\n Yet scarce an army stirs him from his post; \\n\\n Dangers on dangers all around him glow, \\n\\n And toil to toil, and woe succeeds to woe. \\n\\n Say, Muses, throned above the starry frame, \\n\\n How first the navy blazed with Trojan flame? \\n\\n Stern Hector waved his sword, and standing near, \\n\\n Where furious Ajax plied his ashen spear, \\n\\n Full on the lance a stroke so justly sped, \\n\\n That the broad falchion lopp\u0027d its brazen head; \\n\\n His pointless spear the warrior shakes in vain; \\n\\n The brazen head falls sounding on the plain. \\n\\n Great Ajax saw, and own\u0027d the hand divine; \\n\\n Confessing Jove, and trembling at the sign, \\n\\n Warn\u0027d he retreats. Then swift from all sides pour \\n\\n The hissing brands; thick streams the fiery shower; \\n\\n O\u0027er the high stern the curling volumes rise, \\n\\n And sheets of rolling smoke involve the skies. \\n\\n [pg 292] \\n\\n Divine Achilles view\u0027d the rising flames, \\n\\n And smote his thigh, and thus aloud exclaims: \\n\\n \"Arm, arm, Patroclus! Lo, the blaze aspires! \\n\\n The glowing ocean reddens with the fires. \\n\\n Arm, ere our vessels catch the spreading flame; \\n\\n Arm, ere the Grecians be no more a name; \\n\\n I haste to bring the troops.\"—The hero said; \\n\\n The friend with ardour and with joy obey\u0027d. \\n\\n He cased his limbs in brass; and first around \\n\\n His manly legs, with silver buckles bound \\n\\n The clasping greaves; then to his breast applies \\n\\n The flaming cuirass of a thousand dyes; \\n\\n Emblazed with studs of gold his falchion shone \\n\\n In the rich belt, as in a starry zone: \\n\\n Achilles\u0027 shield his ample shoulders spread, \\n\\n Achilles\u0027 helmet nodded o\u0027er his head: \\n\\n Adorn\u0027d in all his terrible array, \\n\\n He flash\u0027d around intolerable day. \\n\\n Alone untouch\u0027d, Pelides\u0027 javelin stands, \\n\\n Not to be poised but by Pelides\u0027 hands: \\n\\n From Pelion\u0027s shady brow the plant entire \\n\\n Old Chiron rent, and shaped it for his sire; \\n\\n Whose son\u0027s great arm alone the weapon wields, \\n\\n The death of heroes, and the dread of fields. \\n\\n \\n\\n Illustration: Buckles. \\n\\n Buckles. \\n\\n The brave Automedon (an honour\u0027d name, \\n\\n The second to his lord in love and fame, \\n\\n In peace his friend, and partner of the war) \\n\\n The winged coursers harness\u0027d to the car; \\n\\n Xanthus and Balius, of immortal breed, \\n\\n Sprung from the wind, and like the wind in speed. \\n\\n Whom the wing\u0027d harpy, swift Podarge, bore, \\n\\n By Zephyr pregnant on the breezy shore: \\n\\n Swift Pedasus was added to their side, \\n\\n (Once great Aetion\u0027s, now Achilles\u0027 pride) \\n\\n Who, like in strength, in swiftness, and in grace, \\n\\n A mortal courser match\u0027d the immortal race. \\n\\n Achilles speeds from tent to tent, and warms \\n\\n His hardy Myrmidons to blood and arms. \\n\\n [pg 293] \\n\\n All breathing death, around the chief they stand, \\n\\n A grim, terrific, formidable band: \\n\\n Grim as voracious wolves, that seek the springs244 \\n\\n When scalding thirst their burning bowels wrings; \\n\\n When some tall stag, fresh-slaughtered in the wood, \\n\\n Has drench\u0027d their wide insatiate throats with blood, \\n\\n To the black fount they rush, a hideous throng, \\n\\n With paunch distended, and with lolling tongue, \\n\\n Fire fills their eye, their black jaws belch the gore, \\n\\n And gorged with slaughter still they thirst for more. \\n\\n Like furious, rush\u0027d the Myrmidonian crew, \\n\\n Such their dread strength, and such their deathful view. \\n\\n High in the midst the great Achilles stands, \\n\\n Directs their order, and the war commands. \\n\\n He, loved of Jove, had launch\u0027d for Ilion\u0027s shores \\n\\n Full fifty vessels, mann\u0027d with fifty oars: \\n\\n Five chosen leaders the fierce bands obey, \\n\\n Himself supreme in valour, as in sway. \\n\\n First march\u0027d Menestheus, of celestial birth, \\n\\n Derived from thee, whose waters wash the earth, \\n\\n Divine Sperchius! Jove-descended flood! \\n\\n A mortal mother mixing with a god. \\n\\n Such was Menestheus, but miscall\u0027d by fame \\n\\n The son of Borus, that espoused the dame. \\n\\n Eudorus next; whom Polymele the gay, \\n\\n Famed in the graceful dance, produced to-day. \\n\\n Her, sly Cellenius loved: on her would gaze, \\n\\n As with swift step she form\u0027d the running maze: \\n\\n To her high chamber from Diana\u0027s quire, \\n\\n The god pursued her, urged, and crown\u0027d his fire. \\n\\n The son confess\u0027d his father\u0027s heavenly race, \\n\\n And heir\u0027d his mother\u0027s swiftness in the chase. \\n\\n Strong Echecleus, bless\u0027d in all those charms \\n\\n That pleased a god, succeeded to her arms; \\n\\n Not conscious of those loves, long hid from fame, \\n\\n With gifts of price he sought and won the dame; \\n\\n Her secret offspring to her sire she bare; \\n\\n Her sire caress\u0027d him with a parent\u0027s care. \\n\\n Pisander follow\u0027d; matchless in his art \\n\\n To wing the spear, or aim the distant dart; \\n\\n No hand so sure of all the Emathian line, \\n\\n Or if a surer, great Patroclus! thine. \\n\\n The fourth by Phoenix\u0027 grave command was graced, \\n\\n Laerces\u0027 valiant offspring led the last. \\n\\n Soon as Achilles with superior care \\n\\n Had call\u0027d the chiefs, and order\u0027d all the war, \\n\\n [pg 294] \\n\\n This stern remembrance to his troops he gave: \\n\\n \"Ye far-famed Myrmidons, ye fierce and brave! \\n\\n Think with what threats you dared the Trojan throng, \\n\\n Think what reproach these ears endured so long; \\n\\n \u0027Stern son of Peleus, (thus ye used to say, \\n\\n While restless, raging, in your ships you lay) \\n\\n Oh nursed with gall, unknowing how to yield; \\n\\n Whose rage defrauds us of so famed a field: \\n\\n If that dire fury must for ever burn, \\n\\n What make we here? Return, ye chiefs, return!\u0027 \\n\\n Such were your words—Now, warriors! grieve no more, \\n\\n Lo there the Trojans; bathe your swords in gore! \\n\\n This day shall give you all your soul demands, \\n\\n Glut all your hearts, and weary all your hands!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Illustration: DIANA. \\n\\n DIANA. \\n\\n Thus while he roused the fire in every breast, \\n\\n Close and more close the listening cohorts press\u0027d; \\n\\n Ranks wedged in ranks; of arms a steely ring \\n\\n Still grows, and spreads, and thickens round the king. \\n\\n As when a circling wall the builder forms, \\n\\n Of strength defensive against wind and storms, \\n\\n Compacted stones the thickening work compose, \\n\\n And round him wide the rising structure grows: \\n\\n So helm to helm, and crest to crest they throng, \\n\\n Shield urged on shield, and man drove man along; \\n\\n Thick, undistinguish\u0027d plumes, together join\u0027d, \\n\\n Float in one sea, and wave before the wind. \\n\\n Far o\u0027er the rest in glittering pomp appear, \\n\\n There bold Automedon, Patroclus here; \\n\\n Brothers in arms, with equal fury fired; \\n\\n Two friends, two bodies with one soul inspired. \\n\\n But mindful of the gods, Achilles went \\n\\n To the rich coffer in his shady tent; \\n\\n There lay on heaps his various garments roll\u0027d, \\n\\n And costly furs, and carpets stiff with gold, \\n\\n (The presents of the silver-footed dame) \\n\\n From thence he took a bowl, of antique frame, \\n\\n Which never man had stained with ruddy wine, \\n\\n Nor raised in offerings to the power divine, \\n\\n [pg 295] \\n\\n But Peleus\u0027 son; and Peleus\u0027 son to none \\n\\n Had raised in offerings, but to Jove alone. \\n\\n This tinged with sulphur, sacred first to flame, \\n\\n He purged; and wash\u0027d it in the running stream. \\n\\n Then cleansed his hands; and fixing for a space \\n\\n His eyes on heaven, his feet upon the place \\n\\n Of sacrifice, the purple draught he pour\u0027d \\n\\n Forth in the midst; and thus the god implored: \\n\\n \"O thou supreme! high-throned all height above! \\n\\n O great Pelasgic, Dodonaean Jove! \\n\\n Who \u0027midst surrounding frosts, and vapours chill, \\n\\n Presid\u0027st on bleak Dodona\u0027s vocal hill: \\n\\n (Whose groves the Selli, race austere! surround, \\n\\n Their feet unwash\u0027d, their slumbers on the ground; \\n\\n Who hear, from rustling oaks, thy dark decrees; \\n\\n And catch the fates, low-whispered in the breeze;) \\n\\n Hear, as of old! Thou gav\u0027st, at Thetis\u0027 prayer, \\n\\n Glory to me, and to the Greeks despair. \\n\\n Lo, to the dangers of the fighting field \\n\\n The best, the dearest of my friends, I yield, \\n\\n Though still determined, to my ships confined; \\n\\n Patroclus gone, I stay but half behind. \\n\\n Oh! be his guard thy providential care, \\n\\n Confirm his heart, and string his arm to war: \\n\\n Press\u0027d by his single force let Hector see \\n\\n His fame in arms not owing all to me. \\n\\n But when the fleets are saved from foes and fire, \\n\\n Let him with conquest and renown retire; \\n\\n Preserve his arms, preserve his social train, \\n\\n And safe return him to these eyes again!\" \\n\\n Great Jove consents to half the chief\u0027s request, \\n\\n But heaven\u0027s eternal doom denies the rest; \\n\\n To free the fleet was granted to his prayer; \\n\\n His safe return, the winds dispersed in air. \\n\\n Back to his tent the stern Achilles flies, \\n\\n And waits the combat with impatient eyes. \\n\\n Meanwhile the troops beneath Patroclus\u0027 care, \\n\\n Invade the Trojans, and commence the war. \\n\\n As wasps, provoked by children in their play, \\n\\n Pour from their mansions by the broad highway, \\n\\n In swarms the guiltless traveller engage, \\n\\n Whet all their stings, and call forth all their rage: \\n\\n All rise in arms, and, with a general cry, \\n\\n Assert their waxen domes, and buzzing progeny. \\n\\n Thus from the tents the fervent legion swarms, \\n\\n So loud their clamours, and so keen their arms: \\n\\n Their rising rage Patroclus\u0027 breath inspires, \\n\\n Who thus inflames them with heroic fires: \\n\\n \"O warriors, partners of Achilles\u0027 praise! \\n\\n Be mindful of your deeds in ancient days; \\n\\n [pg 296] \\n\\n Your godlike master let your acts proclaim, \\n\\n And add new glories to his mighty name. \\n\\n Think your Achilles sees you fight: be brave, \\n\\n And humble the proud monarch whom you save.\" \\n\\n Joyful they heard, and kindling as he spoke, \\n\\n Flew to the fleet, involved in fire and smoke. \\n\\n From shore to shore the doubling shouts resound, \\n\\n The hollow ships return a deeper sound. \\n\\n The war stood still, and all around them gazed, \\n\\n When great Achilles\u0027 shining armour blazed: \\n\\n Troy saw, and thought the dread Achilles nigh, \\n\\n At once they see, they tremble, and they fly. \\n\\n Then first thy spear, divine Patroclus! flew, \\n\\n Where the war raged, and where the tumult grew. \\n\\n Close to the stern of that famed ship which bore \\n\\n Unbless\u0027d Protesilaus to Ilion\u0027s shore, \\n\\n The great Paeonian, bold Pyrechmes stood; \\n\\n (Who led his bands from Axius\u0027 winding flood;) \\n\\n His shoulder-blade receives the fatal wound; \\n\\n The groaning warrior pants upon the ground. \\n\\n His troops, that see their country\u0027s glory slain, \\n\\n Fly diverse, scatter\u0027d o\u0027er the distant plain. \\n\\n Patroclus\u0027 arm forbids the spreading fires, \\n\\n And from the half-burn\u0027d ship proud Troy retires; \\n\\n Clear\u0027d from the smoke the joyful navy lies; \\n\\n In heaps on heaps the foe tumultuous flies; \\n\\n Triumphant Greece her rescued decks ascends, \\n\\n And loud acclaim the starry region rends. \\n\\n So when thick clouds enwrap the mountain\u0027s head, \\n\\n O\u0027er heaven\u0027s expanse like one black ceiling spread; \\n\\n Sudden the Thunderer, with a flashing ray, \\n\\n Bursts through the darkness, and lets down the day: \\n\\n The hills shine out, the rocks in prospect rise, \\n\\n And streams, and vales, and forests, strike the eyes; \\n\\n The smiling scene wide opens to the sight, \\n\\n And all the unmeasured ether flames with light. \\n\\n But Troy repulsed, and scatter\u0027d o\u0027er the plains, \\n\\n Forced from the navy, yet the fight maintains. \\n\\n Now every Greek some hostile hero slew, \\n\\n But still the foremost, bold Patroclus flew: \\n\\n As Areilycus had turn\u0027d him round, \\n\\n Sharp in his thigh he felt the piercing wound; \\n\\n The brazen-pointed spear, with vigour thrown, \\n\\n The thigh transfix\u0027d, and broke the brittle bone: \\n\\n Headlong he fell. Next, Thoas was thy chance; \\n\\n Thy breast, unarm\u0027d, received the Spartan lance. \\n\\n Phylides\u0027 dart (as Amphidus drew nigh) \\n\\n His blow prevented, and transpierced his thigh, \\n\\n Tore all the brawn, and rent the nerves away; \\n\\n In darkness, and in death, the warrior lay. \\n\\n [pg 297] \\n\\n In equal arms two sons of Nestor stand, \\n\\n And two bold brothers of the Lycian band: \\n\\n By great Antilochus, Atymnius dies, \\n\\n Pierced in the flank, lamented youth! he lies, \\n\\n Kind Maris, bleeding in his brother\u0027s wound, \\n\\n Defends the breathless carcase on the ground; \\n\\n Furious he flies, his murderer to engage: \\n\\n But godlike Thrasimed prevents his rage, \\n\\n Between his arm and shoulder aims a blow; \\n\\n His arm falls spouting on the dust below: \\n\\n He sinks, with endless darkness cover\u0027d o\u0027er: \\n\\n And vents his soul, effused with gushing gore. \\n\\n Slain by two brothers, thus two brothers bleed, \\n\\n Sarpedon\u0027s friends, Amisodarus\u0027 seed; \\n\\n Amisodarus, who, by Furies led, \\n\\n The bane of men, abhorr\u0027d Chimaera bred; \\n\\n Skill\u0027d in the dart in vain, his sons expire, \\n\\n And pay the forfeit of their guilty sire. \\n\\n Stopp\u0027d in the tumult Cleobulus lies, \\n\\n Beneath Oileus\u0027 arm, a living prize; \\n\\n A living prize not long the Trojan stood; \\n\\n The thirsty falchion drank his reeking blood: \\n\\n Plunged in his throat the smoking weapon lies; \\n\\n Black death, and fate unpitying, seal his eyes. \\n\\n Amid the ranks, with mutual thirst of fame, \\n\\n Lycon the brave, and fierce Peneleus came; \\n\\n In vain their javelins at each other flew, \\n\\n Now, met in arms, their eager swords they drew. \\n\\n On the plumed crest of his Boeotian foe \\n\\n The daring Lycon aim\u0027d a noble blow; \\n\\n The sword broke short; but his, Peneleus sped \\n\\n Full on the juncture of the neck and head: \\n\\n The head, divided by a stroke so just, \\n\\n Hung by the skin; the body sunk to dust. \\n\\n O\u0027ertaken Neamas by Merion bleeds, \\n\\n Pierced through the shoulder as he mounts his steeds; \\n\\n Back from the car he tumbles to the ground: \\n\\n His swimming eyes eternal shades surround. \\n\\n Next Erymas was doom\u0027d his fate to feel, \\n\\n His open\u0027d mouth received the Cretan steel: \\n\\n Beneath the brain the point a passage tore, \\n\\n Crash\u0027d the thin bones, and drown\u0027d the teeth in gore: \\n\\n His mouth, his eyes, his nostrils, pour a flood; \\n\\n He sobs his soul out in the gush of blood. \\n\\n As when the flocks neglected by the swain, \\n\\n Or kids, or lambs, lie scatter\u0027d o\u0027er the plain, \\n\\n A troop of wolves the unguarded charge survey, \\n\\n And rend the trembling, unresisting prey: \\n\\n Thus on the foe the Greeks impetuous came; \\n\\n Troy fled, unmindful of her former fame. \\n\\n [pg 298] \\n\\n But still at Hector godlike Ajax aim\u0027d, \\n\\n Still, pointed at his breast, his javelin flamed. \\n\\n The Trojan chief, experienced in the field, \\n\\n O\u0027er his broad shoulders spread the massy shield, \\n\\n Observed the storm of darts the Grecians pour, \\n\\n And on his buckler caught the ringing shower: \\n\\n He sees for Greece the scale of conquest rise, \\n\\n Yet stops, and turns, and saves his loved allies. \\n\\n As when the hand of Jove a tempest forms, \\n\\n And rolls the cloud to blacken heaven with storms, \\n\\n Dark o\u0027er the fields the ascending vapour flies, \\n\\n And shades the sun, and blots the golden skies: \\n\\n So from the ships, along the dusky plain, \\n\\n Dire Flight and Terror drove the Trojan train. \\n\\n Even Hector fled; through heads of disarray \\n\\n The fiery coursers forced their lord away: \\n\\n While far behind his Trojans fall confused; \\n\\n Wedged in the trench, in one vast carnage bruised: \\n\\n Chariots on chariots roll: the clashing spokes \\n\\n Shock; while the madding steeds break short their yokes. \\n\\n In vain they labour up the steepy mound; \\n\\n Their charioteers lie foaming on the ground. \\n\\n Fierce on the rear, with shouts Patroclus flies; \\n\\n Tumultuous clamour fills the fields and skies; \\n\\n Thick drifts of dust involve their rapid flight; \\n\\n Clouds rise on clouds, and heaven is snatch\u0027d from sight. \\n\\n The affrighted steeds their dying lords cast down, \\n\\n Scour o\u0027er the fields, and stretch to reach the town. \\n\\n Loud o\u0027er the rout was heard the victor\u0027s cry, \\n\\n Where the war bleeds, and where the thickest die, \\n\\n Where horse and arms, and chariots he o\u0027erthrown, \\n\\n And bleeding heroes under axles groan. \\n\\n No stop, no check, the steeds of Peleus knew: \\n\\n From bank to bank the immortal coursers flew. \\n\\n High-bounding o\u0027er the fosse, the whirling car \\n\\n Smokes through the ranks, o\u0027ertakes the flying war, \\n\\n And thunders after Hector; Hector flies, \\n\\n Patroclus shakes his lance; but fate denies. \\n\\n Not with less noise, with less impetuous force, \\n\\n The tide of Trojans urge their desperate course, \\n\\n Than when in autumn Jove his fury pours, \\n\\n And earth is loaden with incessant showers; \\n\\n (When guilty mortals break the eternal laws, \\n\\n Or judges, bribed, betray the righteous cause;) \\n\\n From their deep beds he bids the rivers rise, \\n\\n And opens all the flood-gates of the skies: \\n\\n The impetuous torrents from their hills obey, \\n\\n Whole fields are drown\u0027d, and mountains swept away; \\n\\n Loud roars the deluge till it meets the main; \\n\\n And trembling man sees all his labours vain! \\n\\n [pg 299] \\n\\n And now the chief (the foremost troops repell\u0027d) \\n\\n Back to the ships his destined progress held, \\n\\n Bore down half Troy in his resistless way, \\n\\n And forced the routed ranks to stand the day. \\n\\n Between the space where silver Simois flows, \\n\\n Where lay the fleets, and where the rampires rose, \\n\\n All grim in dust and blood Patroclus stands, \\n\\n And turns the slaughter on the conquering bands. \\n\\n First Pronous died beneath his fiery dart, \\n\\n Which pierced below the shield his valiant heart. \\n\\n Thestor was next, who saw the chief appear, \\n\\n And fell the victim of his coward fear; \\n\\n Shrunk up he sat, with wild and haggard eye, \\n\\n Nor stood to combat, nor had force to fly; \\n\\n Patroclus mark\u0027d him as he shunn\u0027d the war, \\n\\n And with unmanly tremblings shook the car, \\n\\n And dropp\u0027d the flowing reins. Him \u0027twixt the jaws, \\n\\n The javelin sticks, and from the chariot draws. \\n\\n As on a rock that overhangs the main, \\n\\n An angler, studious of the line and cane, \\n\\n Some mighty fish draws panting to the shore: \\n\\n Not with less ease the barbed javelin bore \\n\\n The gaping dastard; as the spear was shook, \\n\\n He fell, and life his heartless breast forsook. \\n\\n Next on Eryalus he flies; a stone, \\n\\n Large as a rock, was by his fury thrown: \\n\\n Full on his crown the ponderous fragment flew, \\n\\n And burst the helm, and cleft the head in two: \\n\\n Prone to the ground the breathless warrior fell, \\n\\n And death involved him with the shades of hell. \\n\\n Then low in dust Epaltes, Echius, lie; \\n\\n Ipheas, Evippus, Polymelus, die; \\n\\n Amphoterus and Erymas succeed; \\n\\n And last Tlepolemus and Pyres bleed. \\n\\n Where\u0027er he moves, the growing slaughters spread \\n\\n In heaps on heaps a monument of dead. \\n\\n When now Sarpedon his brave friends beheld \\n\\n Grovelling in dust, and gasping on the field, \\n\\n With this reproach his flying host he warms: \\n\\n \"Oh stain to honour! oh disgrace to arms! \\n\\n Forsake, inglorious, the contended plain; \\n\\n This hand unaided shall the war sustain: \\n\\n The task be mine this hero\u0027s strength to try, \\n\\n Who mows whole troops, and makes an army fly.\" \\n\\n He spake: and, speaking, leaps from off the car: \\n\\n Patroclus lights, and sternly waits the war. \\n\\n As when two vultures on the mountain\u0027s height \\n\\n Stoop with resounding pinions to the fight; \\n\\n They cuff, they tear, they raise a screaming cry; \\n\\n The desert echoes, and the rocks reply: \\n\\n [pg 300] \\n\\n The warriors thus opposed in arms, engage \\n\\n With equal clamours, and with equal rage. \\n\\n Jove view\u0027d the combat: whose event foreseen, \\n\\n He thus bespoke his sister and his queen: \\n\\n \"The hour draws on; the destinies ordain,245 \\n\\n My godlike son shall press the Phrygian plain: \\n\\n Already on the verge of death he stands, \\n\\n His life is owed to fierce Patroclus\u0027 hands, \\n\\n What passions in a parent\u0027s breast debate! \\n\\n Say, shall I snatch him from impending fate, \\n\\n And send him safe to Lycia, distant far \\n\\n From all the dangers and the toils of war; \\n\\n Or to his doom my bravest offspring yield, \\n\\n And fatten, with celestial blood, the field?\" \\n\\n Then thus the goddess with the radiant eyes: \\n\\n \"What words are these, O sovereign of the skies! \\n\\n Short is the date prescribed to mortal man; \\n\\n Shall Jove for one extend the narrow span, \\n\\n Whose bounds were fix\u0027d before his race began? \\n\\n How many sons of gods, foredoom\u0027d to death, \\n\\n Before proud Ilion must resign their breath! \\n\\n Were thine exempt, debate would rise above, \\n\\n And murmuring powers condemn their partial Jove. \\n\\n Give the bold chief a glorious fate in fight; \\n\\n And when the ascending soul has wing\u0027d her flight, \\n\\n Let Sleep and Death convey, by thy command, \\n\\n The breathless body to his native land. \\n\\n His friends and people, to his future praise, \\n\\n A marble tomb and pyramid shall raise, \\n\\n And lasting honours to his ashes give; \\n\\n His fame (\u0027tis all the dead can have) shall live.\" \\n\\n She said: the cloud-compeller, overcome, \\n\\n Assents to fate, and ratifies the doom. \\n\\n Then touch\u0027d with grief, the weeping heavens distill\u0027d \\n\\n A shower of blood o\u0027er all the fatal field: \\n\\n [pg 301] \\n\\n The god, his eyes averting from the plain, \\n\\n Laments his son, predestined to be slain, \\n\\n Far from the Lycian shores, his happy native reign. \\n\\n Now met in arms, the combatants appear; \\n\\n Each heaved the shield, and poised the lifted spear; \\n\\n From strong Patroclus\u0027 hand the javelin fled, \\n\\n And pass\u0027d the groin of valiant Thrasymed; \\n\\n The nerves unbraced no more his bulk sustain, \\n\\n He falls, and falling bites the bloody plain. \\n\\n Two sounding darts the Lycian leader threw: \\n\\n The first aloof with erring fury flew, \\n\\n The next transpierced Achilles\u0027 mortal steed, \\n\\n The generous Pedasus of Theban breed: \\n\\n Fix\u0027d in the shoulder\u0027s joint, he reel\u0027d around, \\n\\n Roll\u0027d in the bloody dust, and paw\u0027d the slippery ground. \\n\\n His sudden fall the entangled harness broke; \\n\\n Each axle crackled, and the chariot shook: \\n\\n When bold Automedon, to disengage \\n\\n The starting coursers, and restrain their rage, \\n\\n Divides the traces with his sword, and freed \\n\\n The encumbered chariot from the dying steed: \\n\\n The rest move on, obedient to the rein: \\n\\n The car rolls slowly o\u0027er the dusty plain. \\n\\n The towering chiefs to fiercer fight advance: \\n\\n And first Sarpedon whirl\u0027d his weighty lance, \\n\\n Which o\u0027er the warrior\u0027s shoulder took its course, \\n\\n And spent in empty air its dying force. \\n\\n Not so Patroclus\u0027 never-erring dart; \\n\\n Aim\u0027d at his breast it pierced a mortal part, \\n\\n Where the strong fibres bind the solid heart. \\n\\n Then as the mountain oak, or poplar tall, \\n\\n Or pine (fit mast for some great admiral) \\n\\n Nods to the axe, till with a groaning sound \\n\\n It sinks, and spreads its honours on the ground, \\n\\n Thus fell the king; and laid on earth supine, \\n\\n Before his chariot stretch\u0027d his form divine: \\n\\n He grasp\u0027d the dust distain\u0027d with streaming gore, \\n\\n And, pale in death, lay groaning on the shore. \\n\\n So lies a bull beneath the lion\u0027s paws, \\n\\n While the grim savage grinds with foamy jaws \\n\\n The trembling limbs, and sucks the smoking blood; \\n\\n Deep groans, and hollow roars, rebellow through the wood. \\n\\n Then to the leader of the Lycian band \\n\\n The dying chief address\u0027d his last command; \\n\\n \"Glaucus, be bold; thy task be first to dare \\n\\n The glorious dangers of destructive war, \\n\\n To lead my troops, to combat at their head, \\n\\n Incite the living, and supply the dead. \\n\\n Tell them, I charged them with my latest breath \\n\\n Not unrevenged to bear Sarpedon\u0027s death. \\n\\n [pg 302] \\n\\n What grief, what shame, must Glaucus undergo, \\n\\n If these spoil\u0027d arms adorn a Grecian foe! \\n\\n Then as a friend, and as a warrior fight; \\n\\n Defend my body, conquer in my right: \\n\\n That, taught by great examples, all may try \\n\\n Like thee to vanquish, or like me to die.\" \\n\\n He ceased; the Fates suppress\u0027d his labouring breath, \\n\\n And his eyes darken\u0027d with the shades of death. \\n\\n The insulting victor with disdain bestrode \\n\\n The prostrate prince, and on his bosom trod; \\n\\n Then drew the weapon from his panting heart, \\n\\n The reeking fibres clinging to the dart; \\n\\n From the wide wound gush\u0027d out a stream of blood, \\n\\n And the soul issued in the purple flood. \\n\\n His flying steeds the Myrmidons detain, \\n\\n Unguided now, their mighty master slain. \\n\\n All-impotent of aid, transfix\u0027d with grief, \\n\\n Unhappy Glaucus heard the dying chief: \\n\\n His painful arm, yet useless with the smart \\n\\n Inflicted late by Teucer\u0027s deadly dart, \\n\\n Supported on his better hand he stay\u0027d: \\n\\n To Phoebus then (\u0027twas all he could) he pray\u0027d: \\n\\n \"All-seeing monarch! whether Lycia\u0027s coast, \\n\\n Or sacred Ilion, thy bright presence boast, \\n\\n Powerful alike to ease the wretch\u0027s smart; \\n\\n O hear me! god of every healing art! \\n\\n Lo! stiff with clotted blood, and pierced with pain, \\n\\n That thrills my arm, and shoots through every vein, \\n\\n I stand unable to sustain the spear, \\n\\n And sigh, at distance from the glorious war. \\n\\n Low in the dust is great Sarpedon laid, \\n\\n Nor Jove vouchsafed his hapless offspring aid; \\n\\n But thou, O god of health! thy succour lend, \\n\\n To guard the relics of my slaughter\u0027d friend: \\n\\n For thou, though distant, canst restore my might, \\n\\n To head my Lycians, and support the fight.\" \\n\\n Apollo heard; and, suppliant as he stood, \\n\\n His heavenly hand restrain\u0027d the flux of blood; \\n\\n He drew the dolours from the wounded part, \\n\\n And breathed a spirit in his rising heart. \\n\\n Renew\u0027d by art divine, the hero stands, \\n\\n And owns the assistance of immortal hands. \\n\\n First to the fight his native troops he warms, \\n\\n Then loudly calls on Troy\u0027s vindictive arms; \\n\\n With ample strides he stalks from place to place; \\n\\n Now fires Agenor, now Polydamas: \\n\\n ?neas next, and Hector he accosts; \\n\\n Inflaming thus the rage of all their hosts. \\n\\n \"What thoughts, regardless chief! thy breast employ? \\n\\n Oh too forgetful of the friends of Troy! \\n\\n [pg 303] \\n\\n Those generous friends, who, from their country far, \\n\\n Breathe their brave souls out in another\u0027s war. \\n\\n See! where in dust the great Sarpedon lies, \\n\\n In action valiant, and in council wise, \\n\\n Who guarded right, and kept his people free; \\n\\n To all his Lycians lost, and lost to thee! \\n\\n Stretch\u0027d by Patroclus\u0027 arm on yonder plains, \\n\\n O save from hostile rage his loved remains! \\n\\n Ah let not Greece his conquer\u0027d trophies boast, \\n\\n Nor on his corse revenge her heroes lost!\" \\n\\n He spoke: each leader in his grief partook: \\n\\n Troy, at the loss, through all her legions shook. \\n\\n Transfix\u0027d with deep regret, they view o\u0027erthrown \\n\\n At once his country\u0027s pillar, and their own; \\n\\n A chief, who led to Troy\u0027s beleaguer\u0027d wall \\n\\n A host of heroes, and outshined them all. \\n\\n Fired, they rush on; first Hector seeks the foes, \\n\\n And with superior vengeance greatly glows. \\n\\n But o\u0027er the dead the fierce Patroclus stands, \\n\\n And rousing Ajax, roused the listening bands: \\n\\n \"Heroes, be men; be what you were before; \\n\\n Or weigh the great occasion, and be more. \\n\\n The chief who taught our lofty walls to yield, \\n\\n Lies pale in death, extended on the field. \\n\\n To guard his body Troy in numbers flies; \\n\\n Tis half the glory to maintain our prize. \\n\\n Haste, strip his arms, the slaughter round him spread, \\n\\n And send the living Lycians to the dead.\" \\n\\n The heroes kindle at his fierce command; \\n\\n The martial squadrons close on either hand: \\n\\n Here Troy and Lycia charge with loud alarms, \\n\\n Thessalia there, and Greece, oppose their arms. \\n\\n With horrid shouts they circle round the slain; \\n\\n The clash of armour rings o\u0027er all the plain. \\n\\n Great Jove, to swell the horrors of the fight, \\n\\n O\u0027er the fierce armies pours pernicious night, \\n\\n And round his son confounds the warring hosts, \\n\\n His fate ennobling with a crowd of ghosts. \\n\\n Now Greece gives way, and great Epigeus falls; \\n\\n Agacleus\u0027 son, from Budium\u0027s lofty walls; \\n\\n Who chased for murder thence a suppliant came \\n\\n To Peleus, and the silver-footed dame; \\n\\n Now sent to Troy, Achilles\u0027 arms to aid, \\n\\n He pays due vengeance to his kinsman\u0027s shade. \\n\\n Soon as his luckless hand had touch\u0027d the dead, \\n\\n A rock\u0027s large fragment thunder\u0027d on his head; \\n\\n Hurl\u0027d by Hectorean force it cleft in twain \\n\\n His shatter\u0027d helm, and stretch\u0027d him o\u0027er the slain. \\n\\n Fierce to the van of fight Patroclus came, \\n\\n And, like an eagle darting at his game, \\n\\n [pg 304] \\n\\n Sprung on the Trojan and the Lycian band. \\n\\n What grief thy heart, what fury urged thy hand, \\n\\n O generous Greek! when with full vigour thrown, \\n\\n At Sthenelaus flew the weighty stone, \\n\\n Which sunk him to the dead: when Troy, too near \\n\\n That arm, drew back; and Hector learn\u0027d to fear. \\n\\n Far as an able hand a lance can throw, \\n\\n Or at the lists, or at the fighting foe; \\n\\n So far the Trojans from their lines retired; \\n\\n Till Glaucus, turning, all the rest inspired. \\n\\n Then Bathyclaeus fell beneath his rage, \\n\\n The only hope of Chalcon\u0027s trembling age; \\n\\n Wide o\u0027er the land was stretch\u0027d his large domain, \\n\\n With stately seats, and riches blest in vain: \\n\\n Him, bold with youth, and eager to pursue \\n\\n The flying Lycians, Glaucus met and slew; \\n\\n Pierced through the bosom with a sudden wound, \\n\\n He fell, and falling made the fields resound. \\n\\n The Achaians sorrow for their heroes slain; \\n\\n With conquering shouts the Trojans shake the plain, \\n\\n And crowd to spoil the dead: the Greeks oppose; \\n\\n An iron circle round the carcase grows. \\n\\n Then brave Laogonus resign\u0027d his breath, \\n\\n Despatch\u0027d by Merion to the shades of death: \\n\\n On Ida\u0027s holy hill he made abode, \\n\\n The priest of Jove, and honour\u0027d like his god. \\n\\n Between the jaw and ear the javelin went; \\n\\n The soul, exhaling, issued at the vent. \\n\\n His spear Aeneas at the victor threw, \\n\\n Who stooping forward from the death withdrew; \\n\\n The lance hiss\u0027d harmless o\u0027er his covering shield, \\n\\n And trembling struck, and rooted in the field; \\n\\n There yet scarce spent, it quivers on the plain, \\n\\n Sent by the great Aeneas\u0027 arm in vain. \\n\\n \"Swift as thou art (the raging hero cries) \\n\\n And skill\u0027d in dancing to dispute the prize, \\n\\n My spear, the destined passage had it found, \\n\\n Had fix\u0027d thy active vigour to the ground.\" \\n\\n \"O valiant leader of the Dardan host! \\n\\n (Insulted Merion thus retorts the boast) \\n\\n Strong as you are, \u0027tis mortal force you trust, \\n\\n An arm as strong may stretch thee in the dust. \\n\\n And if to this my lance thy fate be given, \\n\\n Vain are thy vaunts; success is still from heaven: \\n\\n This, instant, sends thee down to Pluto\u0027s coast; \\n\\n Mine is the glory, his thy parting ghost.\" \\n\\n \"O friend (Menoetius\u0027 son this answer gave) \\n\\n With words to combat, ill befits the brave; \\n\\n Not empty boasts the sons of Troy repel, \\n\\n Your swords must plunge them to the shades of hell. \\n\\n [pg 305] \\n\\n To speak, beseems the council; but to dare \\n\\n In glorious action, is the task of war.\" \\n\\n This said, Patroclus to the battle flies; \\n\\n Great Merion follows, and new shouts arise: \\n\\n Shields, helmets rattle, as the warriors close; \\n\\n And thick and heavy sounds the storm of blows. \\n\\n As through the shrilling vale, or mountain ground, \\n\\n The labours of the woodman\u0027s axe resound; \\n\\n Blows following blows are heard re-echoing wide, \\n\\n While crackling forests fall on every side: \\n\\n Thus echoed all the fields with loud alarms, \\n\\n So fell the warriors, and so rung their arms. \\n\\n Now great Sarpedon on the sandy shore, \\n\\n His heavenly form defaced with dust and gore, \\n\\n And stuck with darts by warring heroes shed, \\n\\n Lies undistinguish\u0027d from the vulgar dead. \\n\\n His long-disputed corse the chiefs enclose, \\n\\n On every side the busy combat grows; \\n\\n Thick as beneath some shepherd\u0027s thatch\u0027d abode \\n\\n (The pails high foaming with a milky flood) \\n\\n The buzzing flies, a persevering train, \\n\\n Incessant swarm, and chased return again. \\n\\n Jove view\u0027d the combat with a stern survey, \\n\\n And eyes that flash\u0027d intolerable day. \\n\\n Fix\u0027d on the field his sight, his breast debates \\n\\n The vengeance due, and meditates the fates: \\n\\n Whether to urge their prompt effect, and call \\n\\n The force of Hector to Patroclus\u0027 fall, \\n\\n This instant see his short-lived trophies won, \\n\\n And stretch him breathless on his slaughter\u0027d son; \\n\\n Or yet, with many a soul\u0027s untimely flight, \\n\\n Augment the fame and horror of the fight. \\n\\n To crown Achilles\u0027 valiant friend with praise \\n\\n At length he dooms; and, that his last of days \\n\\n Shall set in glory, bids him drive the foe; \\n\\n Nor unattended see the shades below. \\n\\n Then Hector\u0027s mind he fills with dire dismay; \\n\\n He mounts his car, and calls his hosts away; \\n\\n Sunk with Troy\u0027s heavy fates, he sees decline \\n\\n The scales of Jove, and pants with awe divine. \\n\\n Then, nor before, the hardy Lycians fled, \\n\\n And left their monarch with the common dead: \\n\\n Around, in heaps on heaps, a dreadful wall \\n\\n Of carnage rises, as the heroes fall. \\n\\n (So Jove decreed!) At length the Greeks obtain \\n\\n The prize contested, and despoil the slain. \\n\\n The radiant arms are by Patroclus borne; \\n\\n Patroclus\u0027 ships the glorious spoils adorn. \\n\\n Then thus to Phoebus, in the realms above, \\n\\n Spoke from his throne the cloud-compelling Jove: \\n\\n [pg 306] \\n\\n \"Descend, my Phoebus! on the Phrygian plain, \\n\\n And from the fight convey Sarpedon slain; \\n\\n Then bathe his body in the crystal flood, \\n\\n With dust dishonour\u0027d, and deform\u0027d with blood; \\n\\n O\u0027er all his limbs ambrosial odours shed, \\n\\n And with celestial robes adorn the dead. \\n\\n Those rites discharged, his sacred corse bequeath \\n\\n To the soft arms of silent Sleep and Death. \\n\\n They to his friends the immortal charge shall bear; \\n\\n His friends a tomb and pyramid shall rear: \\n\\n What honour mortals after death receive, \\n\\n Those unavailing honours we may give!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Illustration: SLEEP AND DEATH CONVEYING THE BODY OF SARPEDON TO LYCIA. \\n\\n SLEEP AND DEATH CONVEYING THE BODY OF SARPEDON TO LYCIA. \\n\\n Apollo bows, and from mount Ida\u0027s height, \\n\\n Swift to the field precipitates his flight; \\n\\n Thence from the war the breathless hero bore, \\n\\n Veil\u0027d in a cloud, to silver Simois\u0027 shore; \\n\\n There bathed his honourable wounds, and dress\u0027d \\n\\n His manly members in the immortal vest; \\n\\n And with perfumes of sweet ambrosial dews \\n\\n Restores his freshness, and his form renews. \\n\\n Then Sleep and Death, two twins of winged race, \\n\\n Of matchless swiftness, but of silent pace, \\n\\n Received Sarpedon, at the god\u0027s command, \\n\\n And in a moment reach\u0027d the Lycian land; \\n\\n The corse amidst his weeping friends they laid, \\n\\n Where endless honours wait the sacred shade. \\n\\n Meanwhile Patroclus pours along the plains, \\n\\n With foaming coursers, and with loosen\u0027d reins. \\n\\n Fierce on the Trojan and the Lycian crew, \\n\\n [pg 307] \\n\\n Ah blind to fate! thy headlong fury flew \\n\\n Against what fate and powerful Jove ordain, \\n\\n Vain was thy friend\u0027s command, thy courage vain. \\n\\n For he, the god, whose counsels uncontroll\u0027d \\n\\n Dismay the mighty, and confound the bold; \\n\\n The god who gives, resumes, and orders all, \\n\\n He urged thee on, and urged thee on to fall. \\n\\n Who first, brave hero! by that arm was slain, \\n\\n Who last beneath thy vengeance press\u0027d the plain; \\n\\n When heaven itself thy fatal fury led, \\n\\n And call\u0027d to fill the number of the dead? \\n\\n Adrestus first; Autonous then succeeds; \\n\\n Echeclus follows; next young Megas bleeds, \\n\\n Epistor, Melanippus, bite the ground; \\n\\n The slaughter, Elasus and Mulius crown\u0027d: \\n\\n Then sunk Pylartes to eternal night; \\n\\n The rest, dispersing, trust their fates to flight. \\n\\n Now Troy had stoop\u0027d beneath his matchless power, \\n\\n But flaming Phoebus kept the sacred tower \\n\\n Thrice at the battlements Patroclus strook;246 \\n\\n His blazing aegis thrice Apollo shook; \\n\\n He tried the fourth; when, bursting from the cloud, \\n\\n A more than mortal voice was heard aloud. \\n\\n \"Patroclus! cease; this heaven-defended wall \\n\\n Defies thy lance; not fated yet to fall; \\n\\n Thy friend, thy greater far, it shall withstand, \\n\\n Troy shall not stoop even to Achilles\u0027 hand.\" \\n\\n So spoke the god who darts celestial fires; \\n\\n The Greek obeys him, and with awe retires. \\n\\n While Hector, checking at the Scaean gates \\n\\n His panting coursers, in his breast debates, \\n\\n Or in the field his forces to employ, \\n\\n Or draw the troops within the walls of Troy. \\n\\n Thus while he thought, beside him Phoebus stood, \\n\\n In Asius\u0027 shape, who reigned by Sangar\u0027s flood; \\n\\n (Thy brother, Hecuba! from Dymas sprung, \\n\\n A valiant warrior, haughty, bold, and young;) \\n\\n Thus he accosts him. \"What a shameful sight! \\n\\n God! is it Hector that forbears the fight? \\n\\n Were thine my vigour this successful spear \\n\\n Should soon convince thee of so false a fear. \\n\\n Turn thee, ah turn thee to the field of fame, \\n\\n [pg 308] \\n\\n And in Patroclus\u0027 blood efface thy shame. \\n\\n Perhaps Apollo shall thy arms succeed, \\n\\n And heaven ordains him by thy lance to bleed.\" \\n\\n So spoke the inspiring god; then took his flight, \\n\\n And plunged amidst the tumult of the fight. \\n\\n He bids Cebrion drive the rapid car; \\n\\n The lash resounds, the coursers rush to war. \\n\\n The god the Grecians\u0027 sinking souls depress\u0027d, \\n\\n And pour\u0027d swift spirits through each Trojan breast. \\n\\n Patroclus lights, impatient for the fight; \\n\\n A spear his left, a stone employs his right: \\n\\n With all his nerves he drives it at the foe. \\n\\n Pointed above, and rough and gross below: \\n\\n The falling ruin crush\u0027d Cebrion\u0027s head, \\n\\n The lawless offspring of king Priam\u0027s bed; \\n\\n His front, brows, eyes, one undistinguish\u0027d wound: \\n\\n The bursting balls drop sightless to the ground. \\n\\n The charioteer, while yet he held the rein, \\n\\n Struck from the car, falls headlong on the plain. \\n\\n To the dark shades the soul unwilling glides, \\n\\n While the proud victor thus his fall derides. \\n\\n \"Good heaven! what active feats yon artist shows! \\n\\n What skilful divers are our Phrygian foes! \\n\\n Mark with what ease they sink into the sand! \\n\\n Pity that all their practice is by land!\" \\n\\n Then rushing sudden on his prostrate prize, \\n\\n To spoil the carcase fierce Patroclus flies: \\n\\n Swift as a lion, terrible and bold, \\n\\n That sweeps the field, depopulates the fold; \\n\\n Pierced through the dauntless heart, then tumbles slain, \\n\\n And from his fatal courage finds his bane. \\n\\n At once bold Hector leaping from his car, \\n\\n Defends the body, and provokes the war. \\n\\n Thus for some slaughter\u0027d hind, with equal rage, \\n\\n Two lordly rulers of the wood engage; \\n\\n Stung with fierce hunger, each the prey invades, \\n\\n And echoing roars rebellow through the shades. \\n\\n Stern Hector fastens on the warrior\u0027s head, \\n\\n And by the foot Patroclus drags the dead: \\n\\n While all around, confusion, rage, and fright, \\n\\n Mix the contending hosts in mortal fight. \\n\\n So pent by hills, the wild winds roar aloud \\n\\n In the deep bosom of some gloomy wood; \\n\\n Leaves, arms, and trees, aloft in air are blown, \\n\\n The broad oaks crackle, and the Sylvans groan; \\n\\n This way and that, the rattling thicket bends, \\n\\n And the whole forest in one crash descends. \\n\\n Not with less noise, with less tumultuous rage, \\n\\n In dreadful shock the mingled hosts engage. \\n\\n Darts shower\u0027d on darts, now round the carcase ring; \\n\\n [pg 309] \\n\\n Now flights of arrows bounding from the string: \\n\\n Stones follow stones; some clatter on the fields, \\n\\n Some hard, and heavy, shake the sounding shields. \\n\\n But where the rising whirlwind clouds the plains, \\n\\n Sunk in soft dust the mighty chief remains, \\n\\n And, stretch\u0027d in death, forgets the guiding reins! \\n\\n Now flaming from the zenith, Sol had driven \\n\\n His fervid orb through half the vault of heaven; \\n\\n While on each host with equal tempests fell \\n\\n The showering darts, and numbers sank to hell. \\n\\n But when his evening wheels o\u0027erhung the main, \\n\\n Glad conquest rested on the Grecian train. \\n\\n Then from amidst the tumult and alarms, \\n\\n They draw the conquer\u0027d corse and radiant arms. \\n\\n Then rash Patroclus with new fury glows, \\n\\n And breathing slaughter, pours amid the foes. \\n\\n Thrice on the press like Mars himself he flew, \\n\\n And thrice three heroes at each onset slew. \\n\\n There ends thy glory! there the Fates untwine \\n\\n The last, black remnant of so bright a line: \\n\\n Apollo dreadful stops thy middle way; \\n\\n Death calls, and heaven allows no longer day! \\n\\n For lo! the god in dusky clouds enshrined, \\n\\n Approaching dealt a staggering blow behind. \\n\\n The weighty shock his neck and shoulders feel; \\n\\n His eyes flash sparkles, his stunn\u0027d senses reel \\n\\n In giddy darkness; far to distance flung, \\n\\n His bounding helmet on the champaign rung. \\n\\n Achilles\u0027 plume is stain\u0027d with dust and gore; \\n\\n That plume which never stoop\u0027d to earth before; \\n\\n Long used, untouch\u0027d, in fighting fields to shine, \\n\\n And shade the temples of the mad divine. \\n\\n Jove dooms it now on Hector\u0027s helm to nod; \\n\\n Not long—for fate pursues him, and the god. \\n\\n His spear in shivers falls; his ample shield \\n\\n Drops from his arm: his baldric strows the field: \\n\\n The corslet his astonish\u0027d breast forsakes: \\n\\n Loose is each joint; each nerve with horror shakes; \\n\\n Stupid he stares, and all-assistless stands: \\n\\n Such is the force of more than mortal hands! \\n\\n A Dardan youth there was, well known to fame, \\n\\n From Panthus sprung, Euphorbus was his name; \\n\\n Famed for the manage of the foaming horse, \\n\\n Skill\u0027d in the dart, and matchless in the course: \\n\\n Full twenty knights he tumbled from the car, \\n\\n While yet he learn\u0027d his rudiments of war. \\n\\n His venturous spear first drew the hero\u0027s gore; \\n\\n He struck, he wounded, but he durst no more. \\n\\n Nor, though disarm\u0027d, Patroclus\u0027 fury stood: \\n\\n But swift withdrew the long-protended wood. \\n\\n [pg 310] \\n\\n And turn\u0027d him short, and herded in the crowd. \\n\\n Thus, by an arm divine, and mortal spear, \\n\\n Wounded, at once, Patroclus yields to fear, \\n\\n Retires for succour to his social train, \\n\\n And flies the fate, which heaven decreed, in vain. \\n\\n Stern Hector, as the bleeding chief he views, \\n\\n Breaks through the ranks, and his retreat pursues: \\n\\n The lance arrests him with a mortal wound; \\n\\n He falls, earth thunders, and his arms resound. \\n\\n With him all Greece was sunk; that moment all \\n\\n Her yet-surviving heroes seem\u0027d to fall. \\n\\n So, scorch\u0027d with heat, along the desert score, \\n\\n The roaming lion meets a bristly boar, \\n\\n Fast by the spring; they both dispute the flood, \\n\\n With flaming eyes, and jaws besmear\u0027d with blood; \\n\\n At length the sovereign savage wins the strife; \\n\\n And the torn boar resigns his thirst and life. \\n\\n Patroclus thus, so many chiefs o\u0027erthrown, \\n\\n So many lives effused, expires his own. \\n\\n As dying now at Hector\u0027s feet he lies, \\n\\n He sternly views him, and triumphant cries: \\n\\n \"Lie there, Patroclus! and with thee, the joy \\n\\n Thy pride once promised, of subverting Troy; \\n\\n The fancied scenes of Ilion wrapt in flames, \\n\\n And thy soft pleasures served with captive dames. \\n\\n Unthinking man! I fought those towers to free, \\n\\n And guard that beauteous race from lords like thee: \\n\\n But thou a prey to vultures shalt be made; \\n\\n Thy own Achilles cannot lend thee aid; \\n\\n Though much at parting that great chief might say, \\n\\n And much enjoin thee, this important day. \\n\\n \u0027Return not, my brave friend (perhaps he said), \\n\\n Without the bloody arms of Hector dead.\u0027 \\n\\n He spoke, Patroclus march\u0027d, and thus he sped.\" \\n\\n Supine, and wildly gazing on the skies, \\n\\n With faint, expiring breath, the chief replies: \\n\\n \"Vain boaster! cease, and know the powers divine! \\n\\n Jove\u0027s and Apollo\u0027s is this deed, not thine; \\n\\n To heaven is owed whate\u0027er your own you call, \\n\\n And heaven itself disarm\u0027d me ere my fall. \\n\\n Had twenty mortals, each thy match in might, \\n\\n Opposed me fairly, they had sunk in fight: \\n\\n By fate and Phoebus was I first o\u0027erthrown, \\n\\n Euphorbus next; the third mean part thy own. \\n\\n But thou, imperious! hear my latest breath; \\n\\n The gods inspire it, and it sounds thy death: \\n\\n Insulting man, thou shalt be soon as I; \\n\\n Black fate o\u0027erhangs thee, and thy hour draws nigh; \\n\\n Even now on life\u0027s last verge I see thee stand, \\n\\n I see thee fall, and by Achilles\u0027 hand.\" \\n\\n [pg 311] \\n\\n He faints: the soul unwilling wings her way, \\n\\n (The beauteous body left a load of clay) \\n\\n Flits to the lone, uncomfortable coast; \\n\\n A naked, wandering, melancholy ghost! \\n\\n Then Hector pausing, as his eyes he fed \\n\\n On the pale carcase, thus address\u0027d the dead: \\n\\n \"From whence this boding speech, the stern decree \\n\\n Of death denounced, or why denounced to me? \\n\\n Why not as well Achilles\u0027 fate be given \\n\\n To Hector\u0027s lance? Who knows the will of heaven?\" \\n\\n Pensive he said; then pressing as he lay \\n\\n His breathless bosom, tore the lance away; \\n\\n And upwards cast the corse: the reeking spear \\n\\n He shakes, and charges the bold charioteer. \\n\\n But swift Automedon with loosen\u0027d reins \\n\\n Rapt in the chariot o\u0027er the distant plains, \\n\\n Far from his rage the immortal coursers drove; \\n\\n The immortal coursers were the gift of Jove. \\n\\n \\n\\n Illustration: ?SCULAPIUS. \\n\\n ?SCULAPIUS. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1549/46003.html","bookId":1297,"book":{"id":1297,"title":"The Iliad of Homer 伊利亚特","description":"简介： 《伊利亚特》，或力量之诗 西蒙娜薇依Simone Weil著 吴雅凌译 《伊利亚特》的真正主角、真正主题和中心是力量。人类所操纵的力量，人类被制服的力量，在力量面前人的肉身一再缩退。在诗中，人的灵魂由于与力量的关系而不停产生变化，灵魂自以为拥有力量，却被力量所牵制...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/03/10-49-56-55-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1549","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:49 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:49 AM"}}
