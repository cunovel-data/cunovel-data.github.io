Hector advancing, Menelaus retires; but soon returns with Ajax, and drives him off. This, Glaucus objects to Hector as a flight, who thereupon puts on the armour he had won from Patroclus, and renews the battle. The Greeks give way, till Ajax rallies them: Aeneas sustains the Trojans. Aeneas and Hector Attempt the chariot of Achilles, which is borne off by Automedon. The horses of Achilles deplore the loss of Patroclus: Jupiter covers his body with a thick darkness: the noble prayer of Ajax on that occasion. Menelaus sends Antilochus to Achilles, with the news of Patroclus\u0027 death: then returns to the fight, where, though attacked with the utmost fury, he and Meriones, assisted by the Ajaces, bear off the body to the ships. \\n\\n \\n\\n The time is the evening of the eight-and-twentieth day. The scene lies in the fields before Troy. \\n\\n On the cold earth divine Patroclus spread, \\n\\n Lies pierced with wounds among the vulgar dead. \\n\\n Great Menelaus, touch\u0027d with generous woe, \\n\\n Springs to the front, and guards him from the foe. \\n\\n Thus round her new-fallen young the heifer moves, \\n\\n Fruit of her throes, and first-born of her loves; \\n\\n And anxious (helpless as he lies, and bare) \\n\\n Turns, and re-turns her, with a mother\u0027s care, \\n\\n Opposed to each that near the carcase came, \\n\\n His broad shield glimmers, and his lances flame. \\n\\n The son of Panthus, skill\u0027d the dart to send, \\n\\n Eyes the dead hero, and insults the friend. \\n\\n \"This hand, Atrides, laid Patroclus low; \\n\\n Warrior! desist, nor tempt an equal blow: \\n\\n To me the spoils my prowess won, resign: \\n\\n Depart with life, and leave the glory mine\" \\n\\n The Trojan thus: the Spartan monarch burn\u0027d \\n\\n With generous anguish, and in scorn return\u0027d: \\n\\n [pg 313] \\n\\n \"Laugh\u0027st thou not, Jove! from thy superior throne, \\n\\n When mortals boast of prowess not their own? \\n\\n Not thus the lion glories in his might, \\n\\n Nor panther braves his spotted foe in fight, \\n\\n Nor thus the boar (those terrors of the plain;) \\n\\n Man only vaunts his force, and vaunts in vain. \\n\\n But far the vainest of the boastful kind, \\n\\n These sons of Panthus vent their haughty mind. \\n\\n Yet \u0027twas but late, beneath my conquering steel \\n\\n This boaster\u0027s brother, Hyperenor, fell; \\n\\n Against our arm which rashly he defied, \\n\\n Vain was his vigour, and as vain his pride. \\n\\n These eyes beheld him on the dust expire, \\n\\n No more to cheer his spouse, or glad his sire. \\n\\n Presumptuous youth! like his shall be thy doom, \\n\\n Go, wait thy brother to the Stygian gloom; \\n\\n Or, while thou may\u0027st, avoid the threaten\u0027d fate; \\n\\n Fools stay to feel it, and are wise too late.\" \\n\\n Unmoved, Euphorbus thus: \"That action known, \\n\\n Come, for my brother\u0027s blood repay thy own. \\n\\n His weeping father claims thy destined head, \\n\\n And spouse, a widow in her bridal bed. \\n\\n On these thy conquer\u0027d spoils I shall bestow, \\n\\n To soothe a consort\u0027s and a parent\u0027s woe. \\n\\n No longer then defer the glorious strife, \\n\\n Let heaven decide our fortune, fame, and life.\" \\n\\n Swift as the word the missile lance he flings; \\n\\n The well-aim\u0027d weapon on the buckler rings, \\n\\n But blunted by the brass, innoxious falls. \\n\\n On Jove the father great Atrides calls, \\n\\n Nor flies the javelin from his arm in vain, \\n\\n It pierced his throat, and bent him to the plain; \\n\\n Wide through the neck appears the grisly wound, \\n\\n Prone sinks the warrior, and his arms resound. \\n\\n The shining circlets of his golden hair, \\n\\n Which even the Graces might be proud to wear, \\n\\n Instarr\u0027d with gems and gold, bestrow the shore, \\n\\n With dust dishonour\u0027d, and deform\u0027d with gore. \\n\\n As the young olive, in some sylvan scene, \\n\\n Crown\u0027d by fresh fountains with eternal green, \\n\\n Lifts the gay head, in snowy flowerets fair, \\n\\n And plays and dances to the gentle air; \\n\\n When lo! a whirlwind from high heaven invades \\n\\n The tender plant, and withers all its shades; \\n\\n It lies uprooted from its genial bed, \\n\\n A lovely ruin now defaced and dead: \\n\\n Thus young, thus beautiful, Euphorbus lay, \\n\\n While the fierce Spartan tore his arms away. \\n\\n Proud of his deed, and glorious in the prize, \\n\\n Affrighted Troy the towering victor flies: \\n\\n [pg 314] \\n\\n Flies, as before some mountain lion\u0027s ire \\n\\n The village curs and trembling swains retire, \\n\\n When o\u0027er the slaughter\u0027d bull they hear him roar, \\n\\n And see his jaws distil with smoking gore: \\n\\n All pale with fear, at distance scatter\u0027d round, \\n\\n They shout incessant, and the vales resound. \\n\\n Meanwhile Apollo view\u0027d with envious eyes, \\n\\n And urged great Hector to dispute the prize; \\n\\n (In Mentes\u0027 shape, beneath whose martial care \\n\\n The rough Ciconians learn\u0027d the trade of war;)247 \\n\\n \"Forbear (he cried) with fruitless speed to chase \\n\\n Achilles\u0027 coursers, of ethereal race; \\n\\n They stoop not, these, to mortal man\u0027s command, \\n\\n Or stoop to none but great Achilles\u0027 hand. \\n\\n Too long amused with a pursuit so vain, \\n\\n Turn, and behold the brave Euphorbus slain; \\n\\n By Sparta slain! for ever now suppress\u0027d \\n\\n The fire which burn\u0027d in that undaunted breast!\" \\n\\n Thus having spoke, Apollo wing\u0027d his flight, \\n\\n And mix\u0027d with mortals in the toils of fight: \\n\\n His words infix\u0027d unutterable care \\n\\n Deep in great Hector\u0027s soul: through all the war \\n\\n He darts his anxious eye; and, instant, view\u0027d \\n\\n The breathless hero in his blood imbued, \\n\\n (Forth welling from the wound, as prone he lay) \\n\\n And in the victor\u0027s hands the shining prey. \\n\\n Sheath\u0027d in bright arms, through cleaving ranks he flies, \\n\\n And sends his voice in thunder to the skies: \\n\\n Fierce as a flood of flame by Vulcan sent, \\n\\n It flew, and fired the nations as it went. \\n\\n Atrides from the voice the storm divined, \\n\\n And thus explored his own unconquer\u0027d mind: \\n\\n \"Then shall I quit Patroclus on the plain, \\n\\n Slain in my cause, and for my honour slain! \\n\\n Desert the arms, the relics, of my friend? \\n\\n Or singly, Hector and his troops attend? \\n\\n Sure where such partial favour heaven bestow\u0027d, \\n\\n To brave the hero were to brave the god: \\n\\n Forgive me, Greece, if once I quit the field; \\n\\n \u0027Tis not to Hector, but to heaven I yield. \\n\\n Yet, nor the god, nor heaven, should give me fear, \\n\\n Did but the voice of Ajax reach my ear: \\n\\n Still would we turn, still battle on the plains, \\n\\n And give Achilles all that yet remains \\n\\n Of his and our Patroclus—\" This, no more \\n\\n The time allow\u0027d: Troy thicken\u0027d on the shore. \\n\\n A sable scene! The terrors Hector led. \\n\\n Slow he recedes, and sighing quits the dead. \\n\\n So from the fold the unwilling lion parts, \\n\\n [pg 315] \\n\\n Forced by loud clamours, and a storm of darts; \\n\\n He flies indeed, but threatens as he flies, \\n\\n With heart indignant and retorted eyes. \\n\\n Now enter\u0027d in the Spartan ranks, he turn\u0027d \\n\\n His manly breast, and with new fury burn\u0027d; \\n\\n O\u0027er all the black battalions sent his view, \\n\\n And through the cloud the godlike Ajax knew; \\n\\n Where labouring on the left the warrior stood, \\n\\n All grim in arms, and cover\u0027d o\u0027er with blood; \\n\\n There breathing courage, where the god of day \\n\\n Had sunk each heart with terror and dismay. \\n\\n To him the king: \"Oh Ajax, oh my friend! \\n\\n Haste, and Patroclus\u0027 loved remains defend: \\n\\n The body to Achilles to restore \\n\\n Demands our care; alas, we can no more! \\n\\n For naked now, despoiled of arms, he lies; \\n\\n And Hector glories in the dazzling prize.\" \\n\\n He said, and touch\u0027d his heart. The raging pair \\n\\n Pierced the thick battle, and provoke the war. \\n\\n Already had stern Hector seized his head, \\n\\n And doom\u0027d to Trojan gods the unhappy dead; \\n\\n But soon as Ajax rear\u0027d his tower-like shield, \\n\\n Sprung to his car, and measured back the field, \\n\\n His train to Troy the radiant armour bear, \\n\\n To stand a trophy of his fame in war. \\n\\n Meanwhile great Ajax (his broad shield display\u0027d) \\n\\n Guards the dead hero with the dreadful shade; \\n\\n And now before, and now behind he stood: \\n\\n Thus in the centre of some gloomy wood, \\n\\n With many a step, the lioness surrounds \\n\\n Her tawny young, beset by men and hounds; \\n\\n Elate her heart, and rousing all her powers, \\n\\n Dark o\u0027er the fiery balls each hanging eyebrow lours. \\n\\n Fast by his side the generous Spartan glows \\n\\n With great revenge, and feeds his inward woes. \\n\\n But Glaucus, leader of the Lycian aids, \\n\\n On Hector frowning, thus his flight upbraids: \\n\\n \"Where now in Hector shall we Hector find? \\n\\n A manly form, without a manly mind. \\n\\n Is this, O chief! a hero\u0027s boasted fame? \\n\\n How vain, without the merit, is the name! \\n\\n Since battle is renounced, thy thoughts employ \\n\\n What other methods may preserve thy Troy: \\n\\n \u0027Tis time to try if Ilion\u0027s state can stand \\n\\n By thee alone, nor ask a foreign hand: \\n\\n Mean, empty boast! but shall the Lycians stake \\n\\n Their lives for you? those Lycians you forsake? \\n\\n What from thy thankless arms can we expect? \\n\\n Thy friend Sarpedon proves thy base neglect; \\n\\n Say, shall our slaughter\u0027d bodies guard your walls, \\n\\n [pg 316] \\n\\n While unreveng\u0027d the great Sarpedon falls? \\n\\n Even where he died for Troy, you left him there, \\n\\n A feast for dogs, and all the fowls of air. \\n\\n On my command if any Lycian wait, \\n\\n Hence let him march, and give up Troy to fate. \\n\\n Did such a spirit as the gods impart \\n\\n Impel one Trojan hand or Trojan heart, \\n\\n (Such as should burn in every soul that draws \\n\\n The sword for glory, and his country\u0027s cause) \\n\\n Even yet our mutual arms we might employ, \\n\\n And drag yon carcase to the walls of Troy. \\n\\n Oh! were Patroclus ours, we might obtain \\n\\n Sarpedon\u0027s arms and honour\u0027d corse again! \\n\\n Greece with Achilles\u0027 friend should be repaid, \\n\\n And thus due honours purchased to his shade. \\n\\n But words are vain—Let Ajax once appear, \\n\\n And Hector trembles and recedes with fear; \\n\\n Thou dar\u0027st not meet the terrors of his eye; \\n\\n And lo! already thou prepar\u0027st to fly.\" \\n\\n The Trojan chief with fix\u0027d resentment eyed \\n\\n The Lycian leader, and sedate replied: \\n\\n \"Say, is it just, my friend, that Hector\u0027s ear \\n\\n From such a warrior such a speech should hear? \\n\\n I deem\u0027d thee once the wisest of thy kind, \\n\\n But ill this insult suits a prudent mind. \\n\\n I shun great Ajax? I desert my train? \\n\\n \u0027Tis mine to prove the rash assertion vain; \\n\\n I joy to mingle where the battle bleeds, \\n\\n And hear the thunder of the sounding steeds. \\n\\n But Jove\u0027s high will is ever uncontroll\u0027d, \\n\\n The strong he withers, and confounds the bold; \\n\\n Now crowns with fame the mighty man, and now \\n\\n Strikes the fresh garland from the victor\u0027s brow! \\n\\n Come, through yon squadrons let us hew the way, \\n\\n And thou be witness, if I fear to-day; \\n\\n If yet a Greek the sight of Hector dread, \\n\\n Or yet their hero dare defend the dead.\" \\n\\n Then turning to the martial hosts, he cries: \\n\\n \"Ye Trojans, Dardans, Lycians, and allies! \\n\\n Be men, my friends, in action as in name, \\n\\n And yet be mindful of your ancient fame. \\n\\n Hector in proud Achilles\u0027 arms shall shine, \\n\\n Torn from his friend, by right of conquest mine.\" \\n\\n He strode along the field, as thus he said: \\n\\n (The sable plumage nodded o\u0027er his head:) \\n\\n Swift through the spacious plain he sent a look; \\n\\n One instant saw, one instant overtook \\n\\n The distant band, that on the sandy shore \\n\\n The radiant spoils to sacred Ilion bore. \\n\\n There his own mail unbraced the field bestrow\u0027d; \\n\\n [pg 317] \\n\\n His train to Troy convey\u0027d the massy load. \\n\\n Now blazing in the immortal arms he stands; \\n\\n The work and present of celestial hands; \\n\\n By aged Peleus to Achilles given, \\n\\n As first to Peleus by the court of heaven: \\n\\n His father\u0027s arms not long Achilles wears, \\n\\n Forbid by fate to reach his father\u0027s years. \\n\\n Him, proud in triumph, glittering from afar, \\n\\n The god whose thunder rends the troubled air \\n\\n Beheld with pity; as apart he sat, \\n\\n And, conscious, look\u0027d through all the scene of fate. \\n\\n He shook the sacred honours of his head; \\n\\n Olympus trembled, and the godhead said; \\n\\n \"Ah, wretched man! unmindful of thy end! \\n\\n A moment\u0027s glory; and what fates attend! \\n\\n In heavenly panoply divinely bright \\n\\n Thou stand\u0027st, and armies tremble at thy sight, \\n\\n As at Achilles\u0027 self! beneath thy dart \\n\\n Lies slain the great Achilles\u0027 dearer part. \\n\\n Thou from the mighty dead those arms hast torn, \\n\\n Which once the greatest of mankind had worn. \\n\\n Yet live! I give thee one illustrious day, \\n\\n A blaze of glory ere thou fad\u0027st away. \\n\\n For ah! no more Andromache shall come \\n\\n With joyful tears to welcome Hector home; \\n\\n No more officious, with endearing charms, \\n\\n From thy tired limbs unbrace Pelides\u0027 arms!\" \\n\\n Then with his sable brow he gave the nod \\n\\n That seals his word; the sanction of the god. \\n\\n The stubborn arms (by Jove\u0027s command disposed) \\n\\n Conform\u0027d spontaneous, and around him closed: \\n\\n Fill\u0027d with the god, enlarged his members grew, \\n\\n Through all his veins a sudden vigour flew, \\n\\n The blood in brisker tides began to roll, \\n\\n And Mars himself came rushing on his soul. \\n\\n Exhorting loud through all the field he strode, \\n\\n And look\u0027d, and moved, Achilles, or a god. \\n\\n Now Mesthles, Glaucus, Medon, he inspires, \\n\\n Now Phorcys, Chromius, and Hippothous fires; \\n\\n The great Thersilochus like fury found, \\n\\n Asteropaeus kindled at the sound, \\n\\n And Ennomus, in augury renown\u0027d. \\n\\n \"Hear, all ye hosts, and hear, unnumber\u0027d bands \\n\\n Of neighbouring nations, or of distant lands! \\n\\n \u0027Twas not for state we summon\u0027d you so far, \\n\\n To boast our numbers, and the pomp of war: \\n\\n Ye came to fight; a valiant foe to chase, \\n\\n To save our present, and our future race. \\n\\n Tor this, our wealth, our products, you enjoy, \\n\\n And glean the relics of exhausted Troy. \\n\\n [pg 318] \\n\\n Now then, to conquer or to die prepare; \\n\\n To die or conquer are the terms of war. \\n\\n Whatever hand shall win Patroclus slain, \\n\\n Whoe\u0027er shall drag him to the Trojan train, \\n\\n With Hector\u0027s self shall equal honours claim; \\n\\n With Hector part the spoil, and share the fame.\" \\n\\n Fired by his words, the troops dismiss their fears, \\n\\n They join, they thicken, they protend their spears; \\n\\n Full on the Greeks they drive in firm array, \\n\\n And each from Ajax hopes the glorious prey: \\n\\n Vain hope! what numbers shall the field o\u0027erspread, \\n\\n What victims perish round the mighty dead! \\n\\n Great Ajax mark\u0027d the growing storm from far, \\n\\n And thus bespoke his brother of the war: \\n\\n \"Our fatal day, alas! is come, my friend; \\n\\n And all our wars and glories at an end! \\n\\n \u0027Tis not this corse alone we guard in vain, \\n\\n Condemn\u0027d to vultures on the Trojan plain; \\n\\n We too must yield: the same sad fate must fall \\n\\n On thee, on me, perhaps, my friend, on all. \\n\\n See what a tempest direful Hector spreads, \\n\\n And lo! it bursts, it thunders on our heads! \\n\\n Call on our Greeks, if any hear the call, \\n\\n The bravest Greeks: this hour demands them all.\" \\n\\n The warrior raised his voice, and wide around \\n\\n The field re-echoed the distressful sound. \\n\\n \"O chiefs! O princes, to whose hand is given \\n\\n The rule of men; whose glory is from heaven! \\n\\n Whom with due honours both Atrides grace: \\n\\n Ye guides and guardians of our Argive race! \\n\\n All, whom this well-known voice shall reach from far, \\n\\n All, whom I see not through this cloud of war; \\n\\n Come all! let generous rage your arms employ, \\n\\n And save Patroclus from the dogs of Troy.\" \\n\\n Oilean Ajax first the voice obey\u0027d, \\n\\n Swift was his pace, and ready was his aid: \\n\\n Next him Idomeneus, more slow with age, \\n\\n And Merion, burning with a hero\u0027s rage. \\n\\n The long-succeeding numbers who can name? \\n\\n But all were Greeks, and eager all for fame. \\n\\n Fierce to the charge great Hector led the throng; \\n\\n Whole Troy embodied rush\u0027d with shouts along. \\n\\n Thus, when a mountain billow foams and raves, \\n\\n Where some swoln river disembogues his waves, \\n\\n Full in the mouth is stopp\u0027d the rushing tide, \\n\\n The boiling ocean works from side to side, \\n\\n The river trembles to his utmost shore, \\n\\n And distant rocks re-bellow to the roar. \\n\\n Nor less resolved, the firm Achaian band \\n\\n With brazen shields in horrid circle stand. \\n\\n [pg 319] \\n\\n Jove, pouring darkness o\u0027er the mingled fight, \\n\\n Conceals the warriors\u0027 shining helms in night: \\n\\n To him, the chief for whom the hosts contend \\n\\n Had lived not hateful, for he lived a friend: \\n\\n Dead he protects him with superior care. \\n\\n Nor dooms his carcase to the birds of air. \\n\\n \\n\\n Illustration: FIGHT FOR THE BODY OF PATROCLUS. \\n\\n FIGHT FOR THE BODY OF PATROCLUS. \\n\\n The first attack the Grecians scarce sustain, \\n\\n Repulsed, they yield; the Trojans seize the slain. \\n\\n Then fierce they rally, to revenge led on \\n\\n By the swift rage of Ajax Telamon. \\n\\n (Ajax to Peleus\u0027 son the second name, \\n\\n In graceful stature next, and next in fame) \\n\\n With headlong force the foremost ranks he tore; \\n\\n So through the thicket bursts the mountain boar, \\n\\n And rudely scatters, for a distance round, \\n\\n The frighted hunter and the baying hound. \\n\\n The son of Lethus, brave Pelasgus\u0027 heir, \\n\\n Hippothous, dragg\u0027d the carcase through the war; \\n\\n The sinewy ankles bored, the feet he bound \\n\\n With thongs inserted through the double wound: \\n\\n Inevitable fate o\u0027ertakes the deed; \\n\\n Doom\u0027d by great Ajax\u0027 vengeful lance to bleed: \\n\\n It cleft the helmet\u0027s brazen cheeks in twain; \\n\\n The shatter\u0027d crest and horse-hair strow the plain: \\n\\n With nerves relax\u0027d he tumbles to the ground: \\n\\n The brain comes gushing through the ghastly wound: \\n\\n He drops Patroclus\u0027 foot, and o\u0027er him spread, \\n\\n Now lies a sad companion of the dead: \\n\\n Far from Larissa lies, his native air, \\n\\n And ill requites his parents\u0027 tender care. \\n\\n Lamented youth! in life\u0027s first bloom he fell, \\n\\n [pg 320] \\n\\n Sent by great Ajax to the shades of hell. \\n\\n Once more at Ajax Hector\u0027s javelin flies; \\n\\n The Grecian marking, as it cut the skies, \\n\\n Shunn\u0027d the descending death; which hissing on, \\n\\n Stretch\u0027d in the dust the great Iphytus\u0027 son, \\n\\n Schedius the brave, of all the Phocian kind \\n\\n The boldest warrior and the noblest mind: \\n\\n In little Panope, for strength renown\u0027d, \\n\\n He held his seat, and ruled the realms around. \\n\\n Plunged in his throat, the weapon drank his blood, \\n\\n And deep transpiercing through the shoulder stood; \\n\\n In clanging arms the hero fell and all \\n\\n The fields resounded with his weighty fall. \\n\\n Phorcys, as slain Hippothous he defends, \\n\\n The Telamonian lance his belly rends; \\n\\n The hollow armour burst before the stroke, \\n\\n And through the wound the rushing entrails broke: \\n\\n In strong convulsions panting on the sands \\n\\n He lies, and grasps the dust with dying hands. \\n\\n Struck at the sight, recede the Trojan train: \\n\\n The shouting Argives strip the heroes slain. \\n\\n And now had Troy, by Greece compell\u0027d to yield, \\n\\n Fled to her ramparts, and resign\u0027d the field; \\n\\n Greece, in her native fortitude elate, \\n\\n With Jove averse, had turn\u0027d the scale of fate: \\n\\n But Phoebus urged ?neas to the fight; \\n\\n He seem\u0027d like aged Periphas to sight: \\n\\n (A herald in Anchises\u0027 love grown old, \\n\\n Revered for prudence, and with prudence bold.) \\n\\n Thus he—\"What methods yet, O chief! remain, \\n\\n To save your Troy, though heaven its fall ordain? \\n\\n There have been heroes, who, by virtuous care, \\n\\n By valour, numbers, and by arts of war, \\n\\n Have forced the powers to spare a sinking state, \\n\\n And gain\u0027d at length the glorious odds of fate: \\n\\n But you, when fortune smiles, when Jove declares \\n\\n His partial favour, and assists your wars, \\n\\n Your shameful efforts \u0027gainst yourselves employ, \\n\\n And force the unwilling god to ruin Troy.\" \\n\\n ?neas through the form assumed descries \\n\\n The power conceal\u0027d, and thus to Hector cries: \\n\\n \"Oh lasting shame! to our own fears a prey, \\n\\n We seek our ramparts, and desert the day. \\n\\n A god, nor is he less, my bosom warms, \\n\\n And tells me, Jove asserts the Trojan arms.\" \\n\\n He spoke, and foremost to the combat flew: \\n\\n The bold example all his hosts pursue. \\n\\n Then, first, Leocritus beneath him bled, \\n\\n In vain beloved by valiant Lycomede; \\n\\n Who view\u0027d his fall, and, grieving at the chance, \\n\\n Swift to revenge it sent his angry lance; \\n\\n [pg 321] \\n\\n The whirling lance, with vigorous force address\u0027d, \\n\\n Descends, and pants in Apisaon\u0027s breast; \\n\\n From rich Paeonia\u0027s vales the warrior came, \\n\\n Next thee, Asteropeus! in place and fame. \\n\\n Asteropeus with grief beheld the slain, \\n\\n And rush\u0027d to combat, but he rush\u0027d in vain: \\n\\n Indissolubly firm, around the dead, \\n\\n Rank within rank, on buckler buckler spread, \\n\\n And hemm\u0027d with bristled spears, the Grecians stood, \\n\\n A brazen bulwark, and an iron wood. \\n\\n Great Ajax eyes them with incessant care, \\n\\n And in an orb contracts the crowded war, \\n\\n Close in their ranks commands to fight or fall, \\n\\n And stands the centre and the soul of all: \\n\\n Fix\u0027d on the spot they war, and wounded, wound \\n\\n A sanguine torrent steeps the reeking ground: \\n\\n On heaps the Greeks, on heaps the Trojans bled, \\n\\n And, thickening round them, rise the hills of dead. \\n\\n Greece, in close order, and collected might, \\n\\n Yet suffers least, and sways the wavering fight; \\n\\n Fierce as conflicting fires the combat burns, \\n\\n And now it rises, now it sinks by turns. \\n\\n In one thick darkness all the fight was lost; \\n\\n The sun, the moon, and all the ethereal host \\n\\n Seem\u0027d as extinct: day ravish\u0027d from their eyes, \\n\\n And all heaven\u0027s splendours blotted from the skies. \\n\\n Such o\u0027er Patroclus\u0027 body hung the night, \\n\\n The rest in sunshine fought, and open light; \\n\\n Unclouded there, the aerial azure spread, \\n\\n No vapour rested on the mountain\u0027s head, \\n\\n The golden sun pour\u0027d forth a stronger ray, \\n\\n And all the broad expansion flamed with day. \\n\\n Dispersed around the plain, by fits they fight, \\n\\n And here and there their scatter\u0027d arrows light: \\n\\n But death and darkness o\u0027er the carcase spread, \\n\\n There burn\u0027d the war, and there the mighty bled. \\n\\n Meanwhile the sons of Nestor, in the rear, \\n\\n (Their fellows routed,) toss the distant spear, \\n\\n And skirmish wide: so Nestor gave command, \\n\\n When from the ships he sent the Pylian band. \\n\\n The youthful brothers thus for fame contend, \\n\\n Nor knew the fortune of Achilles\u0027 friend; \\n\\n In thought they view\u0027d him still, with martial joy, \\n\\n Glorious in arms, and dealing death to Troy. \\n\\n But round the corse the heroes pant for breath, \\n\\n And thick and heavy grows the work of death: \\n\\n O\u0027erlabour\u0027d now, with dust, and sweat, and gore, \\n\\n Their knees, their legs, their feet, are covered o\u0027er; \\n\\n Drops follow drops, the clouds on clouds arise, \\n\\n And carnage clogs their hands, and darkness fills their eyes. \\n\\n [pg 322] \\n\\n As when a slaughter\u0027d bull\u0027s yet reeking hide, \\n\\n Strain\u0027d with full force, and tugg\u0027d from side to side, \\n\\n The brawny curriers stretch; and labour o\u0027er \\n\\n The extended surface, drunk with fat and gore: \\n\\n So tugging round the corse both armies stood; \\n\\n The mangled body bathed in sweat and blood; \\n\\n While Greeks and Ilians equal strength employ, \\n\\n Now to the ships to force it, now to Troy. \\n\\n Not Pallas\u0027 self, her breast when fury warms, \\n\\n Nor he whose anger sets the world in arms, \\n\\n Could blame this scene; such rage, such horror reign\u0027d; \\n\\n Such, Jove to honour the great dead ordain\u0027d. \\n\\n Achilles in his ships at distance lay, \\n\\n Nor knew the fatal fortune of the day; \\n\\n He, yet unconscious of Patroclus\u0027 fall, \\n\\n In dust extended under Ilion\u0027s wall, \\n\\n Expects him glorious from the conquered plain, \\n\\n And for his wish\u0027d return prepares in vain; \\n\\n Though well he knew, to make proud Ilion bend \\n\\n Was more than heaven had destined to his friend. \\n\\n Perhaps to him: this Thetis had reveal\u0027d; \\n\\n The rest, in pity to her son, conceal\u0027d. \\n\\n Still raged the conflict round the hero dead, \\n\\n And heaps on heaps by mutual wounds they bled. \\n\\n \"Cursed be the man (even private Greeks would say) \\n\\n Who dares desert this well-disputed day! \\n\\n First may the cleaving earth before our eyes \\n\\n Gape wide, and drink our blood for sacrifice; \\n\\n First perish all, ere haughty Troy shall boast \\n\\n We lost Patroclus, and our glory lost!\" \\n\\n Thus they: while with one voice the Trojans said, \\n\\n \"Grant this day, Jove! or heap us on the dead!\" \\n\\n Then clash their sounding arms; the clangours rise, \\n\\n And shake the brazen concave of the skies. \\n\\n Meantime, at distance from the scene of blood, \\n\\n The pensive steeds of great Achilles stood: \\n\\n Their godlike master slain before their eyes, \\n\\n They wept, and shared in human miseries.248 \\n\\n [pg 323] \\n\\n In vain Automedon now shakes the rein, \\n\\n Now plies the lash, and soothes and threats in vain; \\n\\n Nor to the fight nor Hellespont they go, \\n\\n Restive they stood, and obstinate in woe: \\n\\n Still as a tombstone, never to be moved, \\n\\n On some good man or woman unreproved \\n\\n Lays its eternal weight; or fix\u0027d, as stands \\n\\n A marble courser by the sculptor\u0027s hands, \\n\\n Placed on the hero\u0027s grave. Along their face \\n\\n The big round drops coursed down with silent pace, \\n\\n Conglobing on the dust. Their manes, that late \\n\\n Circled their arched necks, and waved in state, \\n\\n Trail\u0027d on the dust beneath the yoke were spread, \\n\\n And prone to earth was hung their languid head: \\n\\n Nor Jove disdain\u0027d to cast a pitying look, \\n\\n While thus relenting to the steeds he spoke: \\n\\n \"Unhappy coursers of immortal strain, \\n\\n Exempt from age, and deathless, now in vain; \\n\\n Did we your race on mortal man bestow, \\n\\n Only, alas! to share in mortal woe? \\n\\n For ah! what is there of inferior birth, \\n\\n That breathes or creeps upon the dust of earth; \\n\\n What wretched creature of what wretched kind, \\n\\n Than man more weak, calamitous, and blind? \\n\\n A miserable race! but cease to mourn: \\n\\n For not by you shall Priam\u0027s son be borne \\n\\n High on the splendid car: one glorious prize \\n\\n He rashly boasts: the rest our will denies. \\n\\n Ourself will swiftness to your nerves impart, \\n\\n Ourself with rising spirits swell your heart. \\n\\n Automedon your rapid flight shall bear \\n\\n Safe to the navy through the storm of war. \\n\\n For yet \u0027tis given to Troy to ravage o\u0027er \\n\\n The field, and spread her slaughters to the shore; \\n\\n The sun shall see her conquer, till his fall \\n\\n With sacred darkness shades the face of all.\" \\n\\n He said; and breathing in the immortal horse \\n\\n Excessive spirit, urged them to the course; \\n\\n From their high manes they shake the dust, and bear \\n\\n The kindling chariot through the parted war: \\n\\n So flies a vulture through the clamorous train \\n\\n Of geese, that scream, and scatter round the plain. \\n\\n From danger now with swiftest speed they flew, \\n\\n And now to conquest with like speed pursue; \\n\\n Sole in the seat the charioteer remains, \\n\\n Now plies the javelin, now directs the reins: \\n\\n Him brave Alcimedon beheld distress\u0027d, \\n\\n Approach\u0027d the chariot, and the chief address\u0027d: \\n\\n \"What god provokes thee rashly thus to dare, \\n\\n Alone, unaided, in the thickest war? \\n\\n [pg 324] \\n\\n Alas! thy friend is slain, and Hector wields \\n\\n Achilles\u0027 arms triumphant in the fields.\" \\n\\n \"In happy time (the charioteer replies) \\n\\n The bold Alcimedon now greets my eyes; \\n\\n No Greek like him the heavenly steeds restrains, \\n\\n Or holds their fury in suspended reins: \\n\\n Patroclus, while he lived, their rage could tame, \\n\\n But now Patroclus is an empty name! \\n\\n To thee I yield the seat, to thee resign \\n\\n The ruling charge: the task of fight be mine.\" \\n\\n He said. Alcimedon, with active heat, \\n\\n Snatches the reins, and vaults into the seat. \\n\\n His friend descends. The chief of Troy descried, \\n\\n And call\u0027d ?neas fighting near his side. \\n\\n \"Lo, to my sight, beyond our hope restored, \\n\\n Achilles\u0027 car, deserted of its lord! \\n\\n The glorious steeds our ready arms invite, \\n\\n Scarce their weak drivers guide them through the fight. \\n\\n Can such opponents stand when we assail? \\n\\n Unite thy force, my friend, and we prevail.\" \\n\\n The son of Venus to the counsel yields; \\n\\n Then o\u0027er their backs they spread their solid shields: \\n\\n With brass refulgent the broad surface shined, \\n\\n And thick bull-hides the spacious concave lined. \\n\\n Them Chromius follows, Aretus succeeds; \\n\\n Each hopes the conquest of the lofty steeds: \\n\\n In vain, brave youths, with glorious hopes ye burn, \\n\\n In vain advance! not fated to return. \\n\\n Unmov\u0027d, Automedon attends the fight, \\n\\n Implores the Eternal, and collects his might. \\n\\n Then turning to his friend, with dauntless mind: \\n\\n \"Oh keep the foaming coursers close behind! \\n\\n Full on my shoulders let their nostrils blow, \\n\\n For hard the fight, determined is the foe; \\n\\n \u0027Tis Hector comes: and when he seeks the prize, \\n\\n War knows no mean; he wins it or he dies.\" \\n\\n Then through the field he sends his voice aloud, \\n\\n And calls the Ajaces from the warring crowd, \\n\\n With great Atrides. \"Hither turn, (he said,) \\n\\n Turn where distress demands immediate aid; \\n\\n The dead, encircled by his friends, forego, \\n\\n And save the living from a fiercer foe. \\n\\n Unhelp\u0027d we stand, unequal to engage \\n\\n The force of Hector, and ?neas\u0027 rage: \\n\\n Yet mighty as they are, my force to prove \\n\\n Is only mine: the event belongs to Jove.\" \\n\\n He spoke, and high the sounding javelin flung, \\n\\n Which pass\u0027d the shield of Aretus the young: \\n\\n It pierced his belt, emboss\u0027d with curious art, \\n\\n Then in the lower belly struck the dart. \\n\\n [pg 325] \\n\\n As when a ponderous axe, descending full, \\n\\n Cleaves the broad forehead of some brawny bull:249 \\n\\n Struck \u0027twixt the horns, he springs with many a bound, \\n\\n Then tumbling rolls enormous on the ground: \\n\\n Thus fell the youth; the air his soul received, \\n\\n And the spear trembled as his entrails heaved. \\n\\n Now at Automedon the Trojan foe \\n\\n Discharged his lance; the meditated blow, \\n\\n Stooping, he shunn\u0027d; the javelin idly fled, \\n\\n And hiss\u0027d innoxious o\u0027er the hero\u0027s head; \\n\\n Deep rooted in the ground, the forceful spear \\n\\n In long vibrations spent its fury there. \\n\\n With clashing falchions now the chiefs had closed, \\n\\n But each brave Ajax heard, and interposed; \\n\\n Nor longer Hector with his Trojans stood, \\n\\n But left their slain companion in his blood: \\n\\n His arms Automedon divests, and cries, \\n\\n \"Accept, Patroclus, this mean sacrifice: \\n\\n Thus have I soothed my griefs, and thus have paid, \\n\\n Poor as it is, some offering to thy shade.\" \\n\\n So looks the lion o\u0027er a mangled boar, \\n\\n All grim with rage, and horrible with gore; \\n\\n High on the chariot at one bound he sprung, \\n\\n And o\u0027er his seat the bloody trophies hung. \\n\\n And now Minerva from the realms of air \\n\\n Descends impetuous, and renews the war; \\n\\n For, pleased at length the Grecian arms to aid, \\n\\n The lord of thunders sent the blue-eyed maid. \\n\\n As when high Jove denouncing future woe, \\n\\n O\u0027er the dark clouds extends his purple bow, \\n\\n (In sign of tempests from the troubled air, \\n\\n Or from the rage of man, destructive war,) \\n\\n The drooping cattle dread the impending skies, \\n\\n And from his half-till\u0027d field the labourer flies: \\n\\n In such a form the goddess round her drew \\n\\n A livid cloud, and to the battle flew. \\n\\n Assuming Phoenix\u0027 shape on earth she falls, \\n\\n And in his well-known voice to Sparta calls: \\n\\n \"And lies Achilles\u0027 friend, beloved by all, \\n\\n A prey to dogs beneath the Trojan wall? \\n\\n What shame \u0027o Greece for future times to tell, \\n\\n To thee the greatest in whose cause he fell!\" \\n\\n \"O chief, O father! (Atreus\u0027 son replies) \\n\\n O full of days! by long experience wise! \\n\\n What more desires my soul, than here unmoved \\n\\n To guard the body of the man I loved? \\n\\n [pg 326] \\n\\n Ah, would Minerva send me strength to rear \\n\\n This wearied arm, and ward the storm of war! \\n\\n But Hector, like the rage of fire, we dread, \\n\\n And Jove\u0027s own glories blaze around his head!\" \\n\\n Pleased to be first of all the powers address\u0027d, \\n\\n She breathes new vigour in her hero\u0027s breast, \\n\\n And fills with keen revenge, with fell despite, \\n\\n Desire of blood, and rage, and lust of fight. \\n\\n So burns the vengeful hornet (soul all o\u0027er), \\n\\n Repulsed in vain, and thirsty still of gore; \\n\\n (Bold son of air and heat) on angry wings \\n\\n Untamed, untired, he turns, attacks, and stings. \\n\\n Fired with like ardour fierce Atrides flew, \\n\\n And sent his soul with every lance he threw. \\n\\n There stood a Trojan, not unknown to fame, \\n\\n Aetion\u0027s son, and Podes was his name: \\n\\n With riches honour\u0027d, and with courage bless\u0027d, \\n\\n By Hector loved, his comrade, and his guest; \\n\\n Through his broad belt the spear a passage found, \\n\\n And, ponderous as he falls, his arms resound. \\n\\n Sudden at Hector\u0027s side Apollo stood, \\n\\n Like Phaenops, Asius\u0027 son, appear\u0027d the god; \\n\\n (Asius the great, who held his wealthy reign \\n\\n In fair Abydos, by the rolling main.) \\n\\n \"Oh prince! (he cried) Oh foremost once in fame! \\n\\n What Grecian now shall tremble at thy name? \\n\\n Dost thou at length to Menelaus yield, \\n\\n A chief once thought no terror of the field? \\n\\n Yet singly, now, the long-disputed prize \\n\\n He bears victorious, while our army flies: \\n\\n By the same arm illustrious Podes bled; \\n\\n The friend of Hector, unrevenged, is dead!\" \\n\\n This heard, o\u0027er Hector spreads a cloud of woe, \\n\\n Rage lifts his lance, and drives him on the foe. \\n\\n But now the Eternal shook his sable shield, \\n\\n That shaded Ide and all the subject field \\n\\n Beneath its ample verge. A rolling cloud \\n\\n Involved the mount; the thunder roar\u0027d aloud; \\n\\n The affrighted hills from their foundations nod, \\n\\n And blaze beneath the lightnings of the god: \\n\\n At one regard of his all-seeing eye \\n\\n The vanquish\u0027d triumph, and the victors fly. \\n\\n Then trembled Greece: the flight Peneleus led; \\n\\n For as the brave Boeotian turn\u0027d his head \\n\\n To face the foe, Polydamas drew near, \\n\\n And razed his shoulder with a shorten\u0027d spear: \\n\\n By Hector wounded, Leitus quits the plain, \\n\\n Pierced through the wrist; and raging with the pain, \\n\\n Grasps his once formidable lance in vain. \\n\\n As Hector follow\u0027d, Idomen address\u0027d \\n\\n [pg 327] \\n\\n The flaming javelin to his manly breast; \\n\\n The brittle point before his corslet yields; \\n\\n Exulting Troy with clamour fills the fields: \\n\\n High on his chariots the Cretan stood, \\n\\n The son of Priam whirl\u0027d the massive wood. \\n\\n But erring from its aim, the impetuous spear \\n\\n Struck to the dust the squire and charioteer \\n\\n Of martial Merion: Coeranus his name, \\n\\n Who left fair Lyctus for the fields of fame. \\n\\n On foot bold Merion fought; and now laid low, \\n\\n Had graced the triumphs of his Trojan foe, \\n\\n But the brave squire the ready coursers brought, \\n\\n And with his life his master\u0027s safety bought. \\n\\n Between his cheek and ear the weapon went, \\n\\n The teeth it shatter\u0027d, and the tongue it rent. \\n\\n Prone from the seat he tumbles to the plain; \\n\\n His dying hand forgets the falling rein: \\n\\n This Merion reaches, bending from the car, \\n\\n And urges to desert the hopeless war: \\n\\n Idomeneus consents; the lash applies; \\n\\n And the swift chariot to the navy flies. \\n\\n Not Ajax less the will of heaven descried, \\n\\n And conquest shifting to the Trojan side, \\n\\n Turn\u0027d by the hand of Jove. Then thus begun, \\n\\n To Atreus\u0027s seed, the godlike Telamon: \\n\\n \"Alas! who sees not Jove\u0027s almighty hand \\n\\n Transfers the glory to the Trojan band? \\n\\n Whether the weak or strong discharge the dart, \\n\\n He guides each arrow to a Grecian heart: \\n\\n Not so our spears; incessant though they rain, \\n\\n He suffers every lance to fall in vain. \\n\\n Deserted of the god, yet let us try \\n\\n What human strength and prudence can supply; \\n\\n If yet this honour\u0027d corse, in triumph borne, \\n\\n May glad the fleets that hope not our return, \\n\\n Who tremble yet, scarce rescued from their fates, \\n\\n And still hear Hector thundering at their gates. \\n\\n Some hero too must be despatch\u0027d to bear \\n\\n The mournful message to Pelides\u0027 ear; \\n\\n For sure he knows not, distant on the shore, \\n\\n His friend, his loved Patroclus, is no more. \\n\\n But such a chief I spy not through the host: \\n\\n The men, the steeds, the armies, all are lost \\n\\n In general darkness—Lord of earth and air! \\n\\n Oh king! Oh father! hear my humble prayer: \\n\\n Dispel this cloud, the light of heaven restore; \\n\\n Give me to see, and Ajax asks no more: \\n\\n If Greece must perish, we thy will obey, \\n\\n But let us perish in the face of day!\" \\n\\n With tears the hero spoke, and at his prayer \\n\\n [pg 328] \\n\\n The god relenting clear\u0027d the clouded air; \\n\\n Forth burst the sun with all-enlightening ray; \\n\\n The blaze of armour flash\u0027d against the day. \\n\\n \"Now, now, Atrides! cast around thy sight; \\n\\n If yet Antilochus survives the fight, \\n\\n Let him to great Achilles\u0027 ear convey \\n\\n The fatal news\"—Atrides hastes away. \\n\\n So turns the lion from the nightly fold, \\n\\n Though high in courage, and with hunger bold, \\n\\n Long gall\u0027d by herdsmen, and long vex\u0027d by hounds, \\n\\n Stiff with fatigue, and fretted sore with wounds; \\n\\n The darts fly round him from a hundred hands, \\n\\n And the red terrors of the blazing brands: \\n\\n Till late, reluctant, at the dawn of day \\n\\n Sour he departs, and quits the untasted prey, \\n\\n So moved Atrides from his dangerous place \\n\\n With weary limbs, but with unwilling pace; \\n\\n The foe, he fear\u0027d, might yet Patroclus gain, \\n\\n And much admonish\u0027d, much adjured his train: \\n\\n \"O guard these relics to your charge consign\u0027d, \\n\\n And bear the merits of the dead in mind; \\n\\n How skill\u0027d he was in each obliging art; \\n\\n The mildest manners, and the gentlest heart: \\n\\n He was, alas! but fate decreed his end, \\n\\n In death a hero, as in life a friend!\" \\n\\n So parts the chief; from rank to rank he flew, \\n\\n And round on all sides sent his piercing view. \\n\\n As the bold bird, endued with sharpest eye \\n\\n Of all that wings the mid aerial sky, \\n\\n The sacred eagle, from his walks above \\n\\n Looks down, and sees the distant thicket move; \\n\\n Then stoops, and sousing on the quivering hare, \\n\\n Snatches his life amid the clouds of air. \\n\\n Not with less quickness, his exerted sight \\n\\n Pass\u0027d this and that way, through the ranks of fight: \\n\\n Till on the left the chief he sought, he found, \\n\\n Cheering his men, and spreading deaths around: \\n\\n To him the king: \"Beloved of Jove! draw near, \\n\\n For sadder tidings never touch\u0027d thy ear; \\n\\n Thy eyes have witness\u0027d what a fatal turn! \\n\\n How Ilion triumphs, and the Achaians mourn. \\n\\n This is not all: Patroclus, on the shore \\n\\n Now pale and dead, shall succour Greece no more. \\n\\n Fly to the fleet, this instant fly, and tell \\n\\n The sad Achilles, how his loved-one fell: \\n\\n He too may haste the naked corse to gain: \\n\\n The arms are Hector\u0027s, who despoil\u0027d the slain.\" \\n\\n The youthful warrior heard with silent woe, \\n\\n From his fair eyes the tears began to flow: \\n\\n Big with the mighty grief, he strove to say \\n\\n [pg 329] \\n\\n What sorrow dictates, but no word found way. \\n\\n To brave Laodocus his arms he flung, \\n\\n Who, near him wheeling, drove his steeds along; \\n\\n Then ran the mournful message to impart, \\n\\n With tearful eyes, and with dejected heart. \\n\\n Swift fled the youth: nor Menelaus stands \\n\\n (Though sore distress\u0027d) to aid the Pylian bands; \\n\\n But bids bold Thrasymede those troops sustain; \\n\\n Himself returns to his Patroclus slain. \\n\\n \"Gone is Antilochus (the hero said); \\n\\n But hope not, warriors, for Achilles\u0027 aid: \\n\\n Though fierce his rage, unbounded be his woe, \\n\\n Unarm\u0027d, he fights not with the Trojan foe. \\n\\n \u0027Tis in our hands alone our hopes remain, \\n\\n \u0027Tis our own vigour must the dead regain, \\n\\n And save ourselves, while with impetuous hate \\n\\n Troy pours along, and this way rolls our fate.\" \\n\\n \"\u0027Tis well (said Ajax), be it then thy care, \\n\\n With Merion\u0027s aid, the weighty corse to rear; \\n\\n Myself, and my bold brother will sustain \\n\\n The shock of Hector and his charging train: \\n\\n Nor fear we armies, fighting side by side; \\n\\n What Troy can dare, we have already tried, \\n\\n Have tried it, and have stood.\" The hero said. \\n\\n High from the ground the warriors heave the dead. \\n\\n A general clamour rises at the sight: \\n\\n Loud shout the Trojans, and renew the fight. \\n\\n Not fiercer rush along the gloomy wood, \\n\\n With rage insatiate, and with thirst of blood, \\n\\n Voracious hounds, that many a length before \\n\\n Their furious hunters, drive the wounded boar; \\n\\n But if the savage turns his glaring eye, \\n\\n They howl aloof, and round the forest fly. \\n\\n Thus on retreating Greece the Trojans pour, \\n\\n Wave their thick falchions, and their javelins shower: \\n\\n But Ajax turning, to their fears they yield, \\n\\n All pale they tremble and forsake the field. \\n\\n While thus aloft the hero\u0027s corse they bear, \\n\\n Behind them rages all the storm of war: \\n\\n Confusion, tumult, horror, o\u0027er the throng \\n\\n Of men, steeds, chariots, urged the rout along: \\n\\n Less fierce the winds with rising flames conspire \\n\\n To whelm some city under waves of fire; \\n\\n Now sink in gloomy clouds the proud abodes, \\n\\n Now crack the blazing temples of the gods; \\n\\n The rumbling torrent through the ruin rolls, \\n\\n And sheets of smoke mount heavy to the poles. \\n\\n The heroes sweat beneath their honour\u0027d load: \\n\\n As when two mules, along the rugged road, \\n\\n From the steep mountain with exerted strength \\n\\n [pg 330] \\n\\n Drag some vast beam, or mast\u0027s unwieldy length; \\n\\n Inly they groan, big drops of sweat distil, \\n\\n The enormous timber lumbering down the hill: \\n\\n So these—Behind, the bulk of Ajax stands, \\n\\n And breaks the torrent of the rushing bands. \\n\\n Thus when a river swell\u0027d with sudden rains \\n\\n Spreads his broad waters o\u0027er the level plains, \\n\\n Some interposing hill the stream divides. \\n\\n And breaks its force, and turns the winding tides. \\n\\n Still close they follow, close the rear engage; \\n\\n Aeneas storms, and Hector foams with rage: \\n\\n While Greece a heavy, thick retreat maintains, \\n\\n Wedged in one body, like a flight of cranes, \\n\\n That shriek incessant, while the falcon, hung \\n\\n High on poised pinions, threats their callow young. \\n\\n So from the Trojan chiefs the Grecians fly, \\n\\n Such the wild terror, and the mingled cry: \\n\\n Within, without the trench, and all the way, \\n\\n Strow\u0027d in bright heaps, their arms and armour lay; \\n\\n Such horror Jove impress\u0027d! yet still proceeds \\n\\n The work of death, and still the battle bleeds. \\n\\n \\n\\n Illustration: VULCAN FROM AN ANTIQUE GEM. \\n\\n VULCAN FROM AN ANTIQUE GEM. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1549/46004.html","bookId":1297,"book":{"id":1297,"title":"The Iliad of Homer 伊利亚特","description":"简介： 《伊利亚特》，或力量之诗 西蒙娜薇依Simone Weil著 吴雅凌译 《伊利亚特》的真正主角、真正主题和中心是力量。人类所操纵的力量，人类被制服的力量，在力量面前人的肉身一再缩退。在诗中，人的灵魂由于与力量的关系而不停产生变化，灵魂自以为拥有力量，却被力量所牵制...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/03/10-49-56-55-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1549","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:49 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:49 AM"}}
