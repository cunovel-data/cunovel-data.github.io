{"id":110542,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"\"No. I like it up here. We\u0027re disconnected.\" Houses, trees, roads, shopping centers, fields, all passed silently below, too distant to detect the destruction and decay. \"You could almost believe everything was okay down there.\"\\n\\n Dorothy coming back from Oz, thought Mortimer, floating in the wizard\u0027s balloon. There\u0027s no place like home. Except this time when Dorothy lands, sees Kansas up close, she\u0027ll see it was torn apart by a twister.\\n\\n Reverend Jake returned from his conference with Ted, cleared his throat. \"We think it might be best to put down in one of the nearby open spaces, a field or parking lot maybe. Ted\u0027s dubious ability to steer Blowfish might become hazardous if we were to venture among the taller buildings and narrow avenues downtown.\"\\n\\n \"And then what?\" Mortimer asked.\\n\\n \"And then we walk,\" Jake said.\\n\\n Landing involved a controlled deflation of the blimp. There was much pulling of lines and opening of valves. Nothing seemed to happen at first, so lines were pulled further and valves opened wider.\\n\\n Then suddenly they were dropping rapidly.\\n\\n \"Shit almighty, too much,\" Ted yelled. \"Close the valve. Close it.\"\\n\\n They were not plummeting, but neither had they achieved the gentle descent they\u0027d intended. The ground grew big beneath them, and Ted jerked frantically on the tiller, attempting to guide them toward an overgrown suburban baseball diamond.\\n\\n \"Brace yourselves,\" he shouted.\\n\\n They set down hard but without incident and climbed out.\\n\\n Mortimer pointed to a set of bleachers. \"Bill, get as high as you can, look around.\"\\n\\n \"Right.\" Bill jogged toward the stands.\\n\\n Mortimer looked at Ted. \"I need to talk to you.\"\\n\\n \"Talk.\"\\n\\n \"Is there a plan B?\"\\n\\n Ted cackled, shook his head. \"There was barely a plan A.\"\\n\\n \"Tell me.\"\\n\\n Ted explained. He was part of a ragtag, underground army whose goal was to wrest power from the Red Czar. Here\u0027s how Mortimer would help. He would get close to the Czar and find out his evil plans, specifically when the Czar planned to attack Armageddon. Warned ahead of time, Armageddon would be able to organize a surprise counterstrike. It had been Ted\u0027s plan to take Mortimer all the way to downtown Atlanta via Blowfish, landing under cover of darkness on one of the tall buildings. Using the ham radio (now smashed on the road back in Stone Mountain Park), Ted would have coordinated with their \"man on the inside,\" one of the Czar\u0027s trusted men, to capture Mortimer and take him to the Czar. By then it was hoped the Czar\u0027s spies would have reported that Mortimer had recently busted out of Armageddon\u0027s prison with secret knowledge of Armageddon\u0027s defenses, his military strength, etc.\\n\\n \"The Czar won\u0027t be able to resist. Once you get close to him, you find out his plans, kill him if you can.\"\\n\\n Mortimer sighed, looked up, taking in the blue sky and puffy white clouds, scratched his chin. \"That\u0027s a pretty feeble plan.\"\\n\\n \"Well, it\u0027s a fucked-up plan now,\" Ted said. \"We\u0027ll have to improvise. First, we need to get Blowfish out of sight. The Goats will spread the word and the whole metro area will be on the lookout for it.\"\\n\\n They deflated the blimp, the compartments going flaccid as it collapsed in on itself. They shoved the thing into one of the Little League dugouts. All of them together pushed the gondola into a small circle of trees, covered it over with branches.\\n\\n They walked, Reverend Jake on point a hundred yards ahead of them, ready to signal them into hiding if necessary. They zigged and zagged through a residential neighborhood, finally finding an abandoned house with a fireplace just after sundown. They were all exhausted and slept like rocks.\\n\\n They yawned and stretched awake at the first crack of sunlight, Mortimer spewing a string of curses after remembering they\u0027d lost the coffee the day before. \"I wish we\u0027d been able to hang on to our gear.\"\\n\\n Bill hid a yawn behind the back of his hand. \"I still have a few of the cigars in my shirt pocket if you want one.\"\\n\\n \"Later. You sleep okay?\"\\n\\n \"Could have been better. I was right next to Ted. Guy has bad dreams and talks in his sleep. Man, he sure hates Jane Fonda.\"\\n\\n \"We have a long march ahead of us,\" Reverend Jake told them. \"Let\u0027s start the morning right with a quick prayer. O Lord, hear us in our time of need as we march into the bowels of Satan\u0027s stronghold, to wrest a once-prosperous city from his evil clutches. And if it is Your will for us to be gutted and beheaded and our heads put on pikes for the crows to eat our eye sockets hollow and the black flies to plant maggots in our ears, then so be it, although, naturally, we\u0027d prefer that not to happen.\"\\n\\n \"Amen,\" Mortimer said.\\n\\n XLIV\\n\\n The five of them marched steadily, either Reverend Jake or Ted scouting ahead, finding the open path. They passed the debris of an extinct nation, hollow Exxon stations, Subway sandwich shops, Dollar General, Cracker Barrel, check-cashing places, pawnshops, banks and a Laundromat with a yellow Hummer crashed through the front window. On the back of the Hummer was a bumper sticker that said I BRAKE FOR GARAGE SALES.\\n\\n They passed through another residential neighborhood and crossed into a park on the other side: swings, slides, trees, benches. The grass was long and brown.\\n\\n \"Break for lunch here,\" Ted told them. \"I need to scout around, get my bearings.\"\\n\\n Ted left them in the park.\\n\\n \"Benches over by that odd-looking tree.\" Mortimer pointed. \"We can take a load off.\"\\n\\n They walked toward it and realized it wasn\u0027t a tree at all but something fabricated of metal and wires, meant to look like a small weeping willow. When they were standing right in front of it, Mortimer saw that the trunk of the tree had been fashioned from several car bumpers welded and bent. The limbs were car antennas. Headphones and iPods and electrical charge cords hung from the limbs, draped nearly to the ground.\\n\\n Sheila knelt, ran her hand over a wooden plaque, letters burned neatly into the surface:\\n\\n NEW WORLD WILLOW\\n\\n Â¨C ANONYMOUS\\n\\n \"L\u0027art pour l\u0027art,\" Reverend Jake said.\\n\\n Mortimer looked at him. \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing. Let\u0027s eat.\"\\n\\n They sat on the benches. Lunch was meager. Jerky and stale bread, what some of them happened to have in pockets. Most of the food had gone over the side in the mad rush to lighten the blimp.\\n\\n Mortimer munched jerky without enthusiasm, considered the willow again. Somebody had decided to do that, had decided to stop in the shadow of a dangerous city, had paused in the necessary ongoing routine of gathering sustenance and finding shelter, had simply put it all aside to make this thing. To make art.\\n\\n Mortimer couldn\u0027t decide if that was dedication or stupidity. Maybe the harder you fought to live, the more obligated you felt to live for something.\\n\\n He looked at the dangling wires, headphones, MP3 players, computer gadgets. Many were corroded, covered in bird poop. The new world willow had been here awhile. Maybe years. Maybe the artist was dead now. The willow might have been the last thing he ever did.\\n\\n \"I used to have an iPod,\" Bill said around a tough chunk of jerky. \"I used to love to download songs from the Internet. Man, I loved Christina Aguilera. And Moby. I wish they still had music.\"\\n\\n \"They do still have music,\" Sheila said.\\n\\n \"I mean like on CDs and digital and all that,\" Bill said. \"You go into Joey\u0027s and the band plays and that\u0027s fine and everything, but it\u0027s not like going through ten thousand songs on Napster and picking and choosing whatever you want.\"\\n\\n \"Electricity\u0027s coming back,\" Mortimer said. \"People are going to start using things again, microwave ovens and CD players. Maybe even the Internet.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not the same,\" Bill said. \"Not like being connected with everything while it\u0027s happening. You can scavenge old CDs and a player and make it work, but it\u0027s always going to be leftovers. It\u0027ll never be now.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll make a new now,\" Jake said. \"It\u0027ll be tough, but we\u0027ll fight and hang on and make things new again. Here comes Ted.\"\\n\\n Ted had found the path. He led them until nightfall, and they camped within spitting distance of the ruined Atlanta skyline.\\n\\n XLV\\n\\n Mortimer tossed another stick on the fire. \"It\u0027s decision time.\"\\n\\n The others looked up from their places around the camp, eyes wide and curious. They hadn\u0027t realized an announcement was coming.\\n\\n \"This is up to me now,\" Mortimer said. \"We\u0027re about to get neck-deep in Red Stripe territory. I have a personal stake in this. As you know, I\u0027m looking for my wife. I need to see her. Anyway, it\u0027s enough to say that in addition to putting the brakes on this Czar asshole, I have my own motivations, which are nobody else\u0027s problem but mine.\"\\n\\n Sheila frowned, broke eye contact.\\n\\n \"You can shove your hero speech up your ass,\" Bill said. \"If you think I\u0027m the kind to cut out on a partner, then I guess you don\u0027t know me very well at all.\"\\n\\n Mortimer smiled. Damn, he\u0027s a good pal. I\u0027m going to miss him when I get my dumb ass killed. \"I appreciate that, Bill. More than you know. But it\u0027s a one-man job, and there\u0027s just no sense in risking everyone.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re stupid.\" The venom in Sheila\u0027s voice startled them. \"We live in a time when the most valuable thing a person can have is somebody to look out for you and that you can look out for,\" she said. \"And you treat that like it\u0027s not anything. We are here for you. Did your fucking wife come looking for you? Fuck no. Fuck you.\"\\n\\n Mortimer\u0027s mouth fell open. He shut it again. He was simultaneously touched and offended.\\n\\n \"I...\" Mortimer shook his head. So tired. \"Okay. Thanks, guys. Sorry. Should have known better than to try that hero bullshit.\"\\n\\n Sheila turned away, curled up with her back to the fire.\\n\\n \"Damn right,\" Bill said. \"We\u0027ll figure it out as we go. You\u0027ll see.\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\"\\n\\n Mortimer shot Ted a look across the campfire. The old man offered a slight nod in return.\\n\\n The orange-pink smear of dawn was just hinting over the horizon when Mortimer clapped Ted on the shoulder and motioned him to follow. He waited until they were a quarter-mile away before speaking in a low voice.\\n\\n \"Thanks for taking last watch. Makes it easier.\"\\n\\n \"Your friends are going to be pissed,\" Ted said.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s for their own good. What about the reverend?\"\\n\\n Ted shrugged. \"He\u0027s a practical man. He\u0027ll understand, and he can show your people a safe route away from the city.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s make tracks.\"\\n\\n They traveled quickly toward downtown, the buildings growing taller around them with each mile. Ted cautioned that they were well within the Czar\u0027s patrol radius and would need to keep their eyes and ears open.\\n\\n Yeah, thought Mortimer, like I\u0027ve been on a Sunday stroll until now.\\n\\n They passed a number of rotting heads on tall pikes. The entire city had a haunted feel about it.\\n\\n Near Peachtree Plaza, Ted abruptly pulled Mortimer into the shadows of a doorway. They watched in silence as six Red Stripes marched in loose formation on a cross street in front of them. The patrol did not appear to be particularly alert.\\n\\n Mortimer and Ted scampered from hiding place to hiding place all day like that, dodging four more patrols, making their way closer to the Czar\u0027s headquarters.\\n\\n Twice, Mortimer heard engines in the distance, and once he saw a Buick speeding across downtown with two Red Stripes inside. The Buick sported a flag on the antenna, white with a red stripe across the middle.\\n\\n \"If he\u0027s getting gas, why do the Red Stripes still patrol on foot?\" Mortimer asked. \"Seems like he could put them all in pickup trucks.\"\\n\\n \"Various reasons,\" Ted said. \"First of all, they\u0027re saving up the fuel for some kind of big push. The Czar has some kind of surprise in mind, but none of my operatives can find out what it might be. Even old Ted can\u0027t sniff it out. Also, the Czar\u0027s not able to hang on to all of his gas shipments. Somebody\u0027s been raiding his supply line. Heck, we do that ourselves on a small scale. It\u0027s how we get gas for Blowfish\u0027s little motor.\"\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s making the raids?\"\\n\\n \"Search me,\" Ted said.\\n\\n They continued on, finally entering the back door of a building, walking the hallways all the way to the other side, ducking below a window that faced a street on the next block.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the Czar\u0027s stronghold,\" Ted said.\\n\\n Mortimer raised his head for a brief glance and ducked down again. \"The Omni/CNN Center?\"\\n\\n \"Can you believe that shit?\" Ted\u0027s face went red. \"Pisses me right off!\"\\n\\n Mortimer chanced another look, saw a dozen guards or so standing on either side of the entrance.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the Czar\u0027s castle,\" Ted said. \"He hatches all his schemes in there, and his men come and go all day and night carrying out his orders.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the Czar look like?\"\\n\\n \"Haven\u0027t you heard? Eight feet tall with fangs like a shark.\"\\n\\n Mortimer\u0027s eyes grew big until he caught the old man\u0027s smile. He laughed. \"I heard ten feet tall.\"\\n\\n \"What now?\" Ted asked.\\n\\n \"This is as far as you go.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t have to tell me twice. I\u0027m not quite as concerned about your hide as your friends are, but I do wish you luck. You going to bluff your way?\"\\n\\n \"Yup.\"\\n\\n They shook hands.\\n\\n Ted said, \"I\u0027m going to try to get in touch with my people. Who knows? Maybe we can come up with something to help.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks.\"\\n\\n \"Try not to die, Mortimer Tate.\" And then he was gone. Atlanta\u0027s old, gray ghost.\\n\\n Mortimer watched and waited for an hour. He told himself he was trying to get the lay of the land first, familiarize himself with troop movements before going in. Who was he fooling? He was trying to get up the courage.\\n\\n Mortimer took a deep breath, walked out the front door and crossed the street.\\n\\n XLVI\\n\\n When there had been such a thing as television, Mortimer had watched a show called Cops. In this show, police officers habitually wrestled perpetrators to the ground, where they would hit face-first-often on cement-and then have their arms pinned painfully behind their backs in preparation for a pair of handcuffs.\\n\\n Mortimer knew exactly what that felt like now.\\n\\n When Mortimer had crossed the street and casually announced he wanted to see the head honcho, the guards on duty had been momentarily frozen by his audacity. They recovered quickly and gang-piled him, leaving his bottom lip swollen and bloody, various bruises along the length of his body.\\n\\n His hands were tied behind his back.\\n\\n He was searched.\\n\\n He was disarmed.\\n\\n He was taken to a very small room just inside the CNN entrance and put in an uncomfortable chair, a guard standing in front of him, stone-faced, arms crossed, a pistol in a shoulder holster.\\n\\n Mortimer waited for half an hour before another man entered the room. He stood medium height, medium weight, brown hair of a medium shade, but his eyes were blue and active, giving Mortimer a quick appraisal. He wore a well-cut black suit with a black tie. The red armband the only splash of color. An eel-skin briefcase in his grip.\\n\\n \"Hello.\" Too cheerful.\\n\\n \"Hi,\" croaked Mortimer.\\n\\n \"Throat a bit raw? Want some water?\"\\n\\n \"Please.\"\\n\\n The man left, came back thirty seconds later with a glass, tilted it to Mortimer\u0027s lips. Mortimer drank.\\n\\n \"Thanks.\"\\n\\n \"No problem. I\u0027m Terry Frankowski. We\u0027re going to be spending some time together, so I hope you\u0027ll call me Terry.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\"\\n\\n \"So let\u0027s have your story, Mortimer. I hope I can call you Mortimer. Mort?\"\\n\\n \"Mortimer is fine. How do you know my name?\"\\n\\n \"We found your Joey Armageddon\u0027s Platinum membership card among your belongings,\" Terry said. \"Now, let\u0027s get down to business. Ready?\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/go-go-girls-of-the-apocalypse/page-18.html","bookId":1578,"book":{"id":1578,"title":"Go-Go Girls of the Apocalypse","description":"Storyline: Mortimer Tate was a recently divorced insurance salesman when he holed up in a cave on top of a mountain in Tennessee and rode out the end of the world.
