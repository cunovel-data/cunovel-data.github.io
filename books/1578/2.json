She whimpered, her head back, glassy eyes fixed on the ceiling. A big man, maybe a full foot taller than Mortimer, grunted and heaved on top of her, thrusting mercilessly and without grace. His jeans bunched around his ankles. He wore some kind of coarse, black fur coat that made him appear like a prehistoric beast.\\n\\n Mortimer twisted. His head swam. He was bound at the wrists and ankles with thin twine. He writhed, strained against his bonds. No good. The beast continued to thrust. Mortimer tried to sort out what had happened. He\u0027d been hit from behind. He\u0027d been too stupid and eager, let his guard down.\\n\\n The Beast shuddered and howled, then pulled out of the girl with a nasty wet sound. He was flushed and sweating, rolled off her and reached for something. It was one of Mortimer\u0027s bottles, Johnnie Walker, half full. The Beast took a swig, wiped and smacked his lips. His black shaggy hair and beard matched his coat except for the gray at his temples and the corners of his mouth.\\n\\n The Beast saw Mortimer, grinned, slugged back another hit of Johnnie Walker. \"Well, well. Santa Claus is awake.\" He toasted Mortimer with the bottle. \"Thanks for the goodies, Santa.\" Another thick gulp.\\n\\n The girl was already curling into the corner, smoothing the dress back over her thighs. Her face was as blank and white and distant as the moon.\\n\\n The Beast lurched to his feet, reaching for his jeans, his rapidly deflating pecker and balls swinging in a salt-and-pepper thatch. \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re awake. Got some questions for you.\" He fastened his pants, drank more whiskey and nudged the girl\u0027s ass with his boot heel. \"Sheila.\"\\n\\n She turned her head toward him. Her eyes remained unfocused.\\n\\n \"Food.\"\\n\\n She nodded once, got to her feet and went away.\\n\\n The Beast turned his mad grin back at Mortimer. \"Now we have a chat.\" He stepped forward, stood directly over Mortimer. The reek off of the Beast was formidable, a yeasty, pungent cologne of sweat and grease and sex. He shook the bottle of Johnnie Walker in Mortimer\u0027s face. \"Any more where this came from?\" His eyes gleamed like wet, black river stones.\\n\\n Mortimer said nothing, eyes wide and round and waiting.\\n\\n The Beast chuckled from deep in his throat and drank the rest of the Johnnie Walker, hiccupped and belched. He squatted next to Mortimer, sniffed. \"You smell like soap, and you look clean.\"\\n\\n You smell like a turd covered in feta. Mortimer tried twisting out of his bonds again.\\n\\n \"You down from Knoxville? I hear they got power on in Knoxville, but I thought it was just talk.\"\\n\\n Mortimer now recognized the Beast\u0027s black coat as a bear skin. Mortimer remained silent. This was not defiance. Don\u0027t provoke the scary man.\\n\\n The Beast tossed the bottle over his shoulder, and it clinked and tumbled without breaking. \"Cat got your tongue, huh?\" He unzipped his pants, fished inside and came out with his pecker. He leaned, grunted and squirted, the piss splashing against Mortimer\u0027s face.\\n\\n Mortimer sputtered and coughed. The piss was warm. An ammonia taste. It stung his eyes. He gagged, stopped short of vomiting.\\n\\n The Beast laughed. \"Drink up, beautiful.\" He shook off his pecker, zipped up and left the room.\\n\\n Once the piss cooled on his skin, Mortimer shivered.\\n\\n The Beast returned and squatted next to him. He held the bubble wrap that Mortimer had used to protect the whiskey. He held it close to Mortimer\u0027s face, turned it over. Mortimer didn\u0027t understand what he was supposed to see.\\n\\n \"You taped this,\" the Beast said.\\n\\n Mortimer frowned. \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n \"You fucking taped it?\"\\n\\n \"So?\"\\n\\n The Beast\u0027s hammy hand swatted Mortimer\u0027s cheek, the slap loud and sharp. A thousand hot needles in Mortimer\u0027s skin.\\n\\n \"Where the fuck did you get Scotch tape, dipshit?\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n Another quick slap from the Beast, and Mortimer yelled. Ringing in his ears.\\n\\n \"You gonna tell me you just went down to the Walgreens and picked up some goddamn Scotch tape?\"\\n\\n It clicked in Mortimer\u0027s head, a realization sliding into place, the slow understanding. Where the hell did you get Scotch tape after the apocalypse? Something so commonplace, but who would make more? Scotch tape and underarm deodorant and hairspray and antacid and toothpaste and aluminum foil and dishwashing liquid and roach spray and all of civilization\u0027s bright conveniences. Would anyone ever make those things again?\\n\\n \"I found the tape in an old house,\" Mortimer said. \"I was scavenging, and I found it.\"\\n\\n \"Well, ain\u0027t you just the luckiest goddamn scavenger ever.\" The Beast made a noise in his throat, then spit in Mortimer\u0027s face. \"You found tape and ammunition for both your guns and food and whiskey and...and fucking bubble wrap?\" He stood, kicked Mortimer hard in the gut.\\n\\n This time Mortimer did vomit. He rolled his face toward the floor and heaved once, twice. The third time brought up bile.\\n\\n \"Tell me where you got this stuff,\" the Beast said.\\n\\n \"I...I found it.\"\\n\\n \"You found it, huh?\"\\n\\n The Beast stomped the heel of his boot into Mortimer\u0027s forehead. Mortimer grunted.\\n\\n \"I know you fucking found it, cocksucker. Now tell me where.\"\\n\\n Mortimer shook his head. \"A long way from here. I\u0027ve been gathering it up, saving it.\"\\n\\n \"Bullshit.\" The Beast lifted him a foot off the floor by a fistful of hair. \"Nobody carries that much food and booze and doesn\u0027t eat and drink it. What? You just like lugging it around?\" He brought his other fist down hard, knocked Mortimer\u0027s head around.\\n\\n Mortimer blinked, colored lights dancing in front of his eyes and a hot buzz in his ears. He tried to curl into a ball, but the Beast still held him fast.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027d you get it? Someplace close, right?\"\\n\\n Mortimer shook his head.\\n\\n The Beast punched again, and Mortimer felt his lips flatten against his teeth, skin ripping. He spit blood, coughed.\\n\\n \"Shit.\" The Beast let go, and Mortimer\u0027s head knocked against the floor. The Beast left the room again.\\n\\n Mortimer lay on the cold floor, reeking of piss, face throbbing. This had been a mistake, coming down the mountain, trying to reconnect with whatever remained below. He\u0027d been safe, comfortable. There had been no need to leave his sanctuary, only the imagined necessity of human companionship, only the vain notion that he must know what had become of the world.\\n\\n The world had broken, and there was nothing left of humanity but the dregs, dumb sons of bitches in bear skin.\\n\\n Mortimer opened a swollen eye, saw the girl standing over him, her face expressionless.\\n\\n \"Help me,\" Mortimer pleaded.\\n\\n She stood frozen.\\n\\n \"Untie me,\" he croaked. \"I\u0027ll go away. I won\u0027t do anything, I promise. I\u0027ll just go.\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t say a word, didn\u0027t blink. A few moments later she started at the Beast\u0027s return and slunk away.\\n\\n The Beast knelt next to Mortimer, held up a gleaming bowie knife. \"Like it? It ain\u0027t quite as sharp as I\u0027d like, so the cut won\u0027t be clean. I\u0027ll have to saw a bit.\" He grabbed Mortimer\u0027s bound hands, pulled them close to his thick body.\\n\\n Mortimer gasped, tried to jerk away.\\n\\n The Beast shifted, pinned Mortimer\u0027s wrists under his arm. Mortimer tried to squirm away. The Beast selected the pinkie finger on Mortimer\u0027s left hand, stretched it out. Mortimer tried to make a fist and pull away, but the Beast was too strong.\\n\\n \"P-please.\" Saliva flew from Mortimer\u0027s lips. He shook so badly he couldn\u0027t talk.\\n\\n \"I think we\u0027re gonna have a more productive conversation after this.\" The Beast put the blade against the finger. Mortimer renewed his struggles, but the Beast held him.\\n\\n \"Here we go.\" The blade bit deep, dark blood flowing over the metal.\\n\\n Mortimer howled, kicked, screamed. The Beast sawed the blade back and forth. So much blood. Within ten seconds he was down to bone. The Beast leaned his weight into it, sawed bone. The finger came off, blood squirting over both of them.\\n\\n Mortimer lay covered in sweat, limp in the Beast\u0027s lap, like a spent lover deep in swoon. The Beast splashed water on Mortimer\u0027s face, shook him until he woke.\\n\\n \"Okay,\" the Beast said. \"Let\u0027s take it from the top.\"\\n\\n VII\\n\\n The Beast led Mortimer on an eight-foot length of thin rope back down the road toward the entrance of the pocket wilderness. The girl walked silently behind them like the dead, wagless tail of an old dog.\\n\\n Mortimer had lain on the office floor of the dilapidated firehouse and told the Beast all, his secret cabin and the cavern and his storehouse of old-world commodities. The Beast demanded to be taken there. Mortimer had agreed, lying there bleeding and weak.\\n\\n But now, treading the frozen road, Mortimer burned with hate and humiliation and plotted the Beast\u0027s demise. The wind tore at his eyes, face and ankles. A six-foot length of hickory lay across his neck, his wrists tied to the wood in crucifixion fashion. He wore his boots and his pants and shirt. The Beast had taken his parka and socks, marched in front of him holding the rope in one hand, the police special in the other.\\n\\n The Beast wore his bear skin over the parka, and walking along the road, Mortimer on the leash, they looked the grotesque reverse of some old-west traveling carnival act, the dancing bear leading his trainer. Mortimer desperately looked for his opening but did not expect one. He\u0027d have to make some kind of move before they reached the cavern. The Beast would not want to keep and feed Mortimer after he\u0027d been led to the stash.\\n\\n Even in the worst throes of torture, Mortimer had kept his weapons stash a secret. Somehow he\u0027d make a break for it or maybe fake needing to take a shit. If Mortimer could just get his hands on the Uzi, he\u0027d chop the Beast in half with a spray of nine millimeter.\\n\\n They had taken Mortimer\u0027s medical kit too, the iodine and hydrogen peroxide and bandages. They\u0027d used none of it to bind Mortimer\u0027s mangled hand. The girl had splashed the wound with dirty water, wrapped the finger stump in a tattered pink rag. His hand throbbed but bothered him less than the biting cold. He staggered and shook and lurched forward at the Beast\u0027s insistent yank on the rope.\\n\\n Mortimer took another fifty steps, shivered and collapsed.\\n\\n \"Get up.\" The Beast yanked the leash.\\n\\n Mortimer shook his head, panted. He didn\u0027t have the energy to form words.\\n\\n The Beast took two quick steps toward Mortimer, then kicked hard, caught Mortimer in the ribs. Mortimer wheezed and heaved dry.\\n\\n \"I said get up.\" The Beast drew his leg back for another kick.\\n\\n \"Stop.\"\\n\\n The Beast froze, looked for the source of the new voice, which had echoed along the mountain road. Mortimer looked up too. What now?\\n\\n \"Show yourself!\" the Beast yelled.\\n\\n Forty yards up the road, a man stepped out of the bushes, planted himself in the center of the road, legs apart. Mortimer blinked, not sure if he was seeing right. The newcomer wore a black cowboy hat, long leather coat swept back to reveal a pair of pistols hanging on his hips. A blue bandana pulled loose around his neck. A forked beard yellow as the sun, long hair the same color, hands hovering dangerously over the pistols.\\n\\n The Beast squinted. \"What the fuck are you?\"\\n\\n \"Cut that man loose,\" ordered the cowboy.\\n\\n \"Kiss my ass.\" But the Beast\u0027s eyes flicked to the man\u0027s twin six-shooters.\\n\\n \"Mister, I\u0027m gonna tell you just one more time.\" He eased forward as he spoke, one deliberate step at a time. \"Let that man go and piss off. That\u0027s your only chance to live.\"\\n\\n The Beast dropped to the ground, rolled, came up behind Mortimer in a kneeling position. He grabbed Mortimer\u0027s face and pulled him close until the two were cheek to cheek. He pulled the police special, put it against Mortimer\u0027s head. \"I don\u0027t know what your interest is in this guy, but I\u0027ll splatter his brains all over the mountain if you don\u0027t stop right there.\" With his arms spread along the length of hickory, Mortimer provided good cover. Only half the Beast\u0027s face and a bit of shoulder showed.\\n\\n The cowboy froze. He squeezed his fists so tight, Mortimer heard the knuckles crack. They all waited for something to happen.\\n\\n A split second later it did.\\n\\n The cowboy dropped into a kneeling position, one six-shooter flashing from its holster. His arm shot out straight, and he sighted along the barrel, one eye mashed closed, biting his lip in concentration. It all happened in a heartbeat.\\n\\n Bang.\\n\\n The Beast screamed, a high-pitched mix of surprise and pain. He stood, staggered, blood trailing from his shoulder. He swung the police special to return fire.\\n\\n The cowboy was already on his feet. He fanned the six-shooter\u0027s hammer twice, and the Beast fell dead in front of Mortimer. Blood pooled in the Beast\u0027s empty eye sockets.\\n\\n The girl, Sheila, who\u0027d been twenty paces behind the whole encounter, turned and screamed back up the road and out of sight.\\n\\n The cowboy trotted to Mortimer and knelt next to him, began to untie his wrists. \"Hold on, mister. We\u0027ll get you free shortly.\" He had a yellow handlebar moustache to go with the forked beard.\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" Mortimer said. \"Who are you?\"\\n\\n A smile across the young face, under thirty years old. \"Who do I look like?\"\\n\\n \"George Custer.\"\\n\\n The smile fell. \"Damn. I was going for Buffalo Bill.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/go-go-girls-of-the-apocalypse/page-2.html","bookId":1578,"book":{"id":1578,"title":"Go-Go Girls of the Apocalypse","description":"Storyline: Mortimer Tate was a recently divorced insurance salesman when he holed up in a cave on top of a mountain in Tennessee and rode out the end of the world.
