{"id":110544,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"\"Who dares come to see the Red Czar?\" His voice was thunder.\\n\\n \"Uh...Mortimer Tate.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, right through there, then.\" The giant pointed at a door off to the right.\\n\\n Mortimer hesitated. \"What?\"\\n\\n \"You want to see the Czar?\"\\n\\n Mortimer nodded.\\n\\n \"Right through that door. Off you go.\"\\n\\n Mortimer\u0027s eyes shifted to the door, back to the giant. He edged toward the door. Nobody stopped him. He walked through, shut the door behind him.\\n\\n At first, Mortimer thought he was in some kind of enormous kitchen, long countertops, sinks, refrigerators, bubbling vats. A second look, and it seemed more like a laboratory, with beakers and test tubes. Mortimer also noticed a shortwave radio hissing in the corner. It was tempting to run to it and call for help. Bunsen burners heated some of the larger beakers. A chemical smell, yeasty and pungent but vaguely familiar. Many of the vats were labeled.\\n\\n FREDDY\u0027S DISHWATER LAGER.\\n\\n FREDDY\u0027S PISS YELLOW.\\n\\n FREDDY\u0027S TOOTHACHE MUSCADINE.\\n\\n FREDDY\u0027S DRY-HEAVE BRANDY.\\n\\n Mortimer scratched his head.\\n\\n \"Welcome to my little playroom, Mr. Tate,\" said a voice behind him.\\n\\n Mortimer spun, startled. A small man stood before him, a head shorter than Mortimer, bland, pale face, hair a mouse brown. Lips a bit too pink, smile way too happy.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m the Red Czar,\" he said. \"But please call me Freddy.\"\\n\\n XLIX\\n\\n When Mortimer recovered, he said the following: \"You\u0027re shitting me.\"\\n\\n \"I shit you not,\" the little man said.\\n\\n \"But you\u0027re the guy who makes all the booze and beer and everything,\" Mortimer insisted. \"You can\u0027t be the Czar. That\u0027s...that\u0027s...you can\u0027t be the Czar.\"\\n\\n Freddy frowned. \"What did you expect?\"\\n\\n \"Ten feet tall with shark teeth.\"\\n\\n Freddy chuckled. \"Oh, you mean Horace out there in the throne room. Yes, it\u0027s good to perpetuate a certain image. The fear has been a useful tool, and just between you and me, I have a weak spot for that sort of thing. The dungeon too. I used to play a lot of Dungeons \u0026 Dragons.\"\\n\\n \"How...why...?\" Mortimer shook his head, gathered himself. \"So what are you? A brewer who has taken up conquest as a hobby, or a warmonger who just likes to make shitty alcohol on the side?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a long, astounding tale of amazement and wonder.\" Freddy looked at his watch. \"But since I\u0027m launching an offensive tomorrow to smash Joey Armageddon out of existence, I don\u0027t really have the time to do the story justice.\"\\n\\n \"But why would you want to destroy Armageddon? He sells all of your booze in his clubs.\"\\n\\n Freddy\u0027s face hardened. \"He sells it because my Red Stripes control the supply routes. Any of his precious microbrew he tries to deliver gets captured by my men. Then only Freddy\u0027s beer and liquor get through. Stupid Marx thought the means of production was the key. He was a fool. It\u0027s always been about distribution. Only I am able to mass-produce enough product to keep his growing franchise supplied. Well, it\u0027s not good enough. I want the whole thing, soup to nuts. I\u0027ll take over his clubs and I\u0027ll run it all.\" There was a gleam in Freddy\u0027s eyes as he spoke of his intended conquest. An evil gleam.\\n\\n Mortimer noticed a particularly long test tube on the counter close to him. He remembered Armageddon\u0027s instructions. Kill the Czar if possible. He edged toward the test tube. If he could break it off, maybe he could take out Freddy with the jagged end.\\n\\n \"Besides,\" Freddy said. \"You think Joey Armageddon is such a good guy? Those club owners sitting like kings while the whole town bows down to them. Armageddon like an emperor on top of his mountain. It\u0027s positively feudal. He has everyone hypnotized with tits and ass.\"\\n\\n Another two feet and he could make a grab for the test tube. If he jammed it right in Freddy\u0027s throat...\\n\\n But Freddy was watching him. Mortimer had to keep up his end of the conversation. \"So what am I doing here?\"\\n\\n \"We know you escaped from Armageddon\u0027s jail,\" Freddy said. \"My people say you might have useful information.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s why I\u0027m here,\" Mortimer said. \"I thought I might be able to trade the information.\"\\n\\n \"For what?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe I want to move up in the world. Maybe I want to be on the winning side. And maybe I thought I could trade the information for my wife.\"\\n\\n \"From what I hear, she\u0027s not exactly poised to fly back into your arms.\"\\n\\n Mortimer shrugged. \"I\u0027m flexible.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not,\" Freddy stated. \"I launch my assault tomorrow. Armageddon will be crushed, and his ridiculous clubs and all of their resources will belong to me. Once I control the region, the rest of the continent will kneel before me. There\u0027s nothing you can do about it.\"\\n\\n We\u0027ll see about that.\\n\\n Mortimer reached for the test tube. Froze. Slowly pulled his hand back.\\n\\n The automatic pistol in Freddy\u0027s hand was pointed directly at Mortimer\u0027s stomach.\\n\\n Freddy smiled. \"I seem harmless, don\u0027t I? I didn\u0027t just fall off the turnip truck, you know.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s work something out,\" said Mortimer. \"I can tell you about Armageddon\u0027s defenses.\"\\n\\n \"Hmmmmmmm, no, I don\u0027t think so,\" Freddy said.\\n\\n \"You know I can. You have spies who can confirm it.\"\\n\\n \"I have many spies that tell me many things.\" Freddy looked past Mortimer. \"Isn\u0027t that right, Lars?\"\\n\\n Mortimer turned. His mouth fell open.\\n\\n \"My apologies, Mr. Tate,\" Lars said. He also trained an automatic pistol on Mortimer\u0027s midsection. \"Yes, I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ve been in the Czar\u0027s employ the entire time.\"\\n\\n \"An IRS auditor.\" Mortimer spat. \"I should have known.\"\\n\\n \"I wanted to talk to you face-to-face,\" Freddy said. \"There was a chance you really did have some useful information, but now it\u0027s obvious you were merely a pawn in one of Armageddon\u0027s feeble schemes. He must be desperate and weak, so I\u0027m launching my attack immediately to take advantage.\"\\n\\n Mortimer said nothing, exhaled slowly. For nothing. I came all this way, was beaten and burned, all for nothing. My wife doesn\u0027t want my help, and I can\u0027t do a damn thing against the Czar.\\n\\n But he had to try. \"I have information. Stuff Armageddon didn\u0027t know about. You\u0027ve got to listen to me.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve grown tiresome, Mr. Tate,\" Freddy said. \"Lars, please escort Mr. Tate to the elevator, where Jim Ford is waiting to take him to the dog pit.\"\\n\\n \"Now, hold on,\" Mortimer said. \"I think you\u0027d better-wait. Dog pit?\"\\n\\n Lars lifted his pistol. \"This way if you please, Mr. Tate.\"\\n\\n Lars took Mortimer back to the elevator. Jim Ford, Terry Frankowski and a brace of goons waited for him. Lars motioned him aboard the elevator, offered him only a slight nod of the head as the doors closed and the elevator began its long descent.\\n\\n \"So I hear you\u0027re for the dog pit,\" Ford said. \"Good. The boys can use a little entertainment.\"\\n\\n Mortimer said, \"I don\u0027t suppose the dog pit is your colorful name for the local sports bar.\"\\n\\n They all laughed at that.\\n\\n \"No, it\u0027s an actual pit,\" Terry said. \"About twenty feet deep.\"\\n\\n \"With dogs,\" added Ford. \"Rottweilers. Usually a half-dozen or so.\"\\n\\n Terry\u0027s hand shot out, poked a finger at the button for the third floor.\\n\\n Ford said, \"We\u0027re supposed to head straight for the dog pit. What the hell are you doing?\"\\n\\n \"I forgot something in my office,\" Terry said. \"It won\u0027t take but a second.\"\\n\\n \"The hell with that,\" Ford said. \"Get whatever it is later.\"\\n\\n Terry sighed. \"I\u0027ve already pressed the button.\"\\n\\n \"Just let the doors open and close again, and we\u0027ll be on our way,\" Ford said.\\n\\n The lights on the display counted down, seventh floor, sixth floor, fifth floor...\\n\\n When the button lit up for the fourth floor, Terry grabbed Mortimer\u0027s wrist. When the light blinked for the third floor, Terry dropped, pulled Mortimer down with him right as the elevator doors slid open.\\n\\n Jim Ford had just enough time to say, \"Aw, hell-\"\\n\\n Ted and Reverend Jake on the other side of the door let loose with a pair of machine pistols, spraying the interior of the elevator at chest level. The blaze of slugs shredded meat, and the Red Stripes convulsed in place as the bullets hit. Blood rained down on Mortimer\u0027s head and back. Bodies fell on top of him.\\n\\n He shoved them off. \"What the fuck?\"\\n\\n Ted and the reverend each got an arm and pulled him up. Reverend Jake looked down at the bodies. \"God have mercy on your black-hearted souls.\"\\n\\n \"Terry is our man on the inside,\" Ted explained. \"He helped organize your escape.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry I had to burn you with the cigarette,\" Terry said. \"I had to keep up appearances.\"\\n\\n \"No problem.\" Mortimer kneed him in the balls.\\n\\n Terry whuffed air, bent in half, groaned. \"Okay. That\u0027s cool. I deserve that.\"\\n\\n \"Did you get close to him?\" Ted\u0027s eyes were wild with hope and anticipation. \"He sent for you, right? Did you kill him?\"\\n\\n \"I never had a chance,\" Mortimer said. \"The Czar\u0027s been one step ahead the whole time. He knew who I was. He knew everything.\"\\n\\n \"Shit. You didn\u0027t find out anything?\"\\n\\n \"He didn\u0027t spare me a lot of time,\" Mortimer said. \"He\u0027s too busy getting ready for his big attack tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"Tomorrow?\" Ted and the reverend said together.\\n\\n \"Spawn of Satan,\" the reverend said. \"He barely has enough gasoline. We thought for sure he\u0027d wait another week, maybe even two.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve got to get word to Armageddon,\" Ted said. \"And we\u0027ve been standing here too long anyway.\"\\n\\n They shoved the dead Red Stripes into the hallway and took the elevator. Ted pressed the button for the roof.\\n\\n \"Wait,\" Mortimer said. \"My wife! The Czar has my wife and a bunch of other women held captive. We can\u0027t leave them.\"\\n\\n \"No time,\" Ted said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not leaving without them,\" Mortimer insisted.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re all the way at the top of the other tower,\" Terry said. \"We\u0027d never make it.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/go-go-girls-of-the-apocalypse/page-20.html","bookId":1578,"book":{"id":1578,"title":"Go-Go Girls of the Apocalypse","description":"Storyline: Mortimer Tate was a recently divorced insurance salesman when he holed up in a cave on top of a mountain in Tennessee and rode out the end of the world.
