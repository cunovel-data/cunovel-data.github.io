{"id":7011,"no":43,"title":"Book 8 Chapter 6 Three Human Hearts Differently Constructed","content":"Phoebus was not dead, however. Men of that stamp die hard. When Master Philippe Lheulier, advocate extraordinary of the king, had said to poor Esmeralda; \"He is dying,\" it was an error or a jest. When the archdeacon had repeated to the condemned girl; \"He is dead,\" the fact is that he knew nothing about it, but that he believed it, that he counted on it, that he did not doubt it, that he devoutly hoped it. It would have been too hard for him to give favorable news of his rival to the woman whom he loved. Any man would have done the same in his place. It was not that Phoebus\u0027s wound had not been serious, but it had not been as much so as the archdeacon believed. The physician, to whom the soldiers of the watch had carried him at the first moment, had feared for his life during the space of a week, and had even told him so in Latin. But youth had gained the upper hand; and, as frequently happens, in spite of prognostications and diagnoses, nature had amused herself by saving the sick man under the physician\u0027s very nose. It was while he was still lying on the leech\u0027s pallet that he had submitted to the interrogations of Philippe Lheulier and the official inquisitors, which had annoyed him greatly. Hence, one fine morning, feeling himself better, he had left his golden spurs with the leech as payment, and had slipped away. This had not, however, interfered with the progress of the affair. Justice, at that epoch, troubled itself very little about the clearness and definiteness of a criminal suit. Provided that the accused was hung, that was all that was necessary. Now the judge had plenty of proofs against la Esmeralda. They had supposed Phoebus to be dead, and that was the end of the matter. Phoebus, on his side, had not fled far. He had simply rejoined his company in garrison at Queue-en-Brie, in the Isle-de-France, a few stages from Paris. After all, it did not please him in the least to appear in this suit. He had a vague feeling that be should play a ridiculous figure in it. On the whole, he did not know what to think of the whole affair. Superstitious, and not given to devoutness, like every soldier who is only a soldier, when he came to question himself about this adventure, he did not feel assured as to the goat, as to the singular fashion in which he had met La Esmeralda, as to the no less strange manner in which she had allowed him to divine her love, as to her character as a gypsy, and lastly, as to the surly monk. He perceived in all these incidents much more magic than love, probably a sorceress, perhaps the devil; a comedy, in short, or to speak in the language of that day, a very disagreeable mystery, in which he played a very awkward part, the role of blows and derision. The captain was quite put out of countenance about it; he experienced that sort of shame which our La Fontaine has so admirably defined,-- Ashamed as a fox who has been caught by a fowl. Moreover, he hoped that the affair would not get noised abroad, that his name would hardly be pronounced in it, and that in any case it would not go beyond the courts of the Tournelle. In this he was not mistaken, there was then no \"Gazette des Tribunaux;\" and as not a week passed which had not its counterfeiter to boil, or its witch to hang, or its heretic to burn, at some one of the innumerable justices of Paris, people were so accustomed to seeing in all the squares the ancient feudal Themis, bare armed, with sleeves stripped up, performing her duty at the gibbets, the ladders, and the pillories, that they hardly paid any heed to it. Fashionable society of that day hardly knew the name of the victim who passed by at the corner of the street, and it was the populace at the most who regaled themselves with this coarse fare. An execution was an habitual incident of the public highways, like the braising-pan of the baker or the slaughter-house of the knacker. The executioner was only a sort of butcher of a little deeper dye than the rest. Hence Phoebus\u0027s mind was soon at ease on the score of the enchantress Esmeralda, or Similar, as he called her, concerning the blow from the dagger of the Bohemian or of the surly monk (it mattered little which to him), and as to the issue of the trial. But as soon as his heart was vacant in that direction, Fleur-de-Lys returned to it. Captain Phoebus\u0027s heart, like the physics of that day, abhorred a vacuum. Queue-en-Brie was a very insipid place to stay at then, a village of farriers, and cow-girls with chapped hands, a long line of poor dwellings and thatched cottages, which borders the grand road on both sides for half a league; a tail (queue), in short, as its name imports. Fleur-de-Lys was his last passion but one, a pretty girl, a charming dowry; accordingly, one fine morning, quite cured, and assuming that, after the lapse of two months, the Bohemian affair must be completely finished and forgotten, the amorous cavalier arrived on a prancing horse at the door of the Gondelaurier mansion. He paid no attention to a tolerably numerous rabble which had assembled in the Place du Parvis, before the portal of Notre-Dame; he remembered that it was the month of May; he supposed that it was some procession, some Pentecost, some festival, hitched his horse to the ring at the door, and gayly ascended the stairs to his beautiful betrothed. She was alone with her mother. The scene of the witch, her goat, her cursed alphabet, and Phoebus\u0027s long absences, still weighed on Fleur-de-Lys\u0027s heart. Nevertheless, when she beheld her captain enter, she thought him so handsome, his doublet so new, his baldrick so shining, and his air so impassioned, that she blushed with pleasure. The noble damsel herself was more charming than ever. Her magnificent blond hair was plaited in a ravishing manner, she was dressed entirely in that sky blue which becomes fair people so well, a bit of coquetry which she had learned from Colombe, and her eyes were swimming in that languor of love which becomes them still better. Phoebus, who had seen nothing in the line of beauty, since he left the village maids of Queue-en-Brie, was intoxicated with Fleur-de-Lys, which imparted to our officer so eager and gallant an air, that his peace was immediately made. Madame de Gondelaurier herself, still maternally seated in her big arm- chair, had not the heart to scold him. As for Fleur-de-Lys\u0027s reproaches, they expired in tender cooings. The young girl was seated near the window still embroidering her grotto of Neptune. The captain was leaning over the back of her chair, and she was addressing her caressing reproaches to him in a low voice. \"What has become of you these two long months, wicked man?\" \"I swear to you,\" replied Phoebus, somewhat embarrassed by the question, \"that you are beautiful enough to set an archbishop to dreaming.\" She could not repress a smile. \"Good, good, sir. Let my beauty alone and answer my question. A fine beauty, in sooth!\" \"Well, my dear cousin, I was recalled to the garrison. \"And where is that, if you please? and why did not you come to say farewell?\" \"At Queue-en-Brie.\" Phoebus was delighted with the first question, which helped him to avoid the second. \"But that is quite close by, monsieur. Why did you not come to see me a single time?\" Here Phoebus was rather seriously embarrassed. \"Because--the service--and then, charming cousin, I have been ill.\" \"Ill!\" she repeated in alarm. \"Yes, wounded!\" \"Wounded!\" She poor child was completely upset. \"Oh! do not be frightened at that,\" said Phoebus, carelessly, \"it was nothing. A quarrel, a sword cut; what is that to you?\" \"What is that to me?\" exclaimed Fleur-de-Lys, raising her beautiful eyes filled with tears. \"Oh! you do not say what you think when you speak thus. What sword cut was that? I wish to know all.\" \"Well, my dear fair one, I had a falling out with Mahè Fédy, you know? the lieutenant of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, and we ripped open a few inches of skin for each other. That is all.\" The mendacious captain was perfectly well aware that an affair of honor always makes a man stand well in the eyes of a woman. In fact, Fleur-de-Lys looked him full in the face, all agitated with fear, pleasure, and admiration. Still, she was not completely reassured. \"Provided that you are wholly cured, my Phoebus!\" said she. \"I do not know your Mahè Fédy, but he is a villanous man. And whence arose this quarrel?\" Here Phoebus, whose imagination was endowed with but mediocre power of creation, began to find himself in a quandary as to a means of extricating himself for his prowess. \"Oh! how do I know?--a mere nothing, a horse, a remark! Fair cousin,\" he exclaimed, for the sake of changing the conversation, \"what noise is this in the Cathedral Square?\" He approached the window. \"Oh! ~Mon Dieu~, fair cousin, how many people there are on the Place!\" \"I know not,\" said Fleur-de-Lys; \"it appears that a witch is to do penance this morning before the church, and thereafter to be hung.\" The captain was so thoroughly persuaded that la Esmeralda\u0027s affair was concluded, that he was but little disturbed by Fleur- de-Lys\u0027s words. Still, he asked her one or two questions. \"What is the name of this witch?\" \"I do not know,\" she replied. \"And what is she said to have done?\" She shrugged her white shoulders. \"I know not.\" \"Oh, ~mon Dieu~ Jesus!\" said her mother; \"there are so many witches nowadays that I dare say they burn them without knowing their names. One might as well seek the name of every cloud in the sky. After all, one may be tranquil. The good God keeps his register.\" Here the venerable dame rose and came to the window. \"Good Lord! you are right, Phoebus,\" said she. \"The rabble is indeed great. There are people on all the roofs, blessed be God! Do you know, Phoebus, this reminds me of my best days. The entrance of King Charles VII., when, also, there were many people. I no longer remember in what year that was. When I speak of this to you, it produces upon you the effect,--does it not?--the effect of something very old, and upon me of something very young. Oh! the crowd was far finer than at the present day. They even stood upon the machicolations of the Porte Sainte- Antoine. The king had the queen on a pillion, and after their highnesses came all the ladies mounted behind all the lords. I remember that they laughed loudly, because beside Amanyon de Garlande, who was very short of stature, there rode the Sire Matefelon, a chevalier of gigantic size, who had killed heaps of English. It was very fine. A procession of all the gentlemen of France, with their oriflammes waving red before the eye. There were some with pennons and some with banners. How can I tell? the Sire de Calm with a pennon; Jean de Chateaumorant with a banner; the Sire de Courcy with a banner, and a more ample one than any of the others except the Duc de Bourbon. Alas! \u0027tis a sad thing to think that all that has existed and exists no longer!\" The two lovers were not listening to the venerable dowager. Phoebus had returned and was leaning on the back of his betrothed\u0027s chair, a charming post whence his libertine glance plunged into all the openings of Fleur-de-Lys\u0027s gorget. This gorget gaped so conveniently, and allowed him to see so many exquisite things and to divine so many more, that Phoebus, dazzled by this skin with its gleams of satin, said to himself, \"How can any one love anything but a fair skin?\" Both were silent. The young girl raised sweet, enraptured eyes to him from time to time, and their hair mingled in a ray of spring sunshine. \"Phoebus,\" said Fleur-de-Lys suddenly, in a low voice, \"we are to be married three months hence; swear to me that you have never loved any other woman than myself.\" \"I swear it, fair angel!\" replied Phoebus, and his passionate glances aided the sincere tone of his voice in convincing Fleur-de-Lys. Meanwhile, the good mother, charmed to see the betrothed pair on terms of such perfect understanding, had just quitted the apartment to attend to some domestic matter; Phoebus observed it, and this so emboldened the adventurous captain that very strange ideas mounted to his brain. Fleur-de-Lys loved him, he was her betrothed; she was alone with him; his former taste for her had re-awakened, not with all its fresh- ness but with all its ardor; after all, there is no great harm in tasting one\u0027s wheat while it is still in the blade; I do not know whether these ideas passed through his mind, but one thing is certain, that Fleur-de-Lys was suddenly alarmed by the expression of his glance. She looked round and saw that her mother was no longer there. \"Good heavens!\" said she, blushing and uneasy, \"how very warm I am?\" \"I think, in fact,\" replied Phoebus, \"that it cannot be far from midday. The sun is troublesome. We need only lower the curtains.\" \"No, no,\" exclaimed the poor little thing, \"on the contrary, I need air.\" And like a fawn who feels the breath of the pack of hounds, she rose, ran to the window, opened it, and rushed upon the balcony. Phoebus, much discomfited, followed her. The Place du Parvis Notre-Dame, upon which the balcony looked, as the reader knows, presented at that moment a singular and sinister spectacle which caused the fright of the timid Fleur-de-Lys to change its nature. An immense crowd, which overflowed into all the neighboring streets, encumbered the Place, properly speaking. The little wall, breast high, which surrounded the Place, would not have sufficed to keep it free had it not been lined with a thick hedge of sergeants and hackbuteers, culverines in hand. Thanks to this thicket of pikes and arquebuses, the Parvis was empty. Its entrance was guarded by a force of halberdiers with the armorial bearings of the bishop. The large doors of the church were closed, and formed a contrast with the innumerable windows on the Place, which, open to their very gables, allowed a view of thousands of heads heaped up almost like the piles of bullets in a park of artillery. The surface of this rabble was dingy, dirty, earthy. The spectacle which it was expecting was evidently one of the sort which possess the privilege of bringing out and calling together the vilest among the populace. Nothing is so hideous as the noise which was made by that swarm of yellow caps and dirty heads. In that throng there were more laughs than cries, more women than men. From time to time, a sharp and vibrating voice pierced the general clamor. \"Ohé! Mahiet Baliffre! Is she to be hung yonder?\" \"Fool! t\u0027is here that she is to make her apology in her shift! the good God is going to cough Latin in her face! That is always done here, at midday. If \u0027tis the gallows that you wish, go to the Grève.\" \"I will go there, afterwards.\" \"Tell me, la Boucanbry? Is it true that she has refused a confessor?\" \"It appears so, La Bechaigne.\" \"You see what a pagan she is!\" \"\u0027Tis the custom, monsieur. The bailiff of the courts is bound to deliver the malefactor ready judged for execution if he be a layman, to the provost of Paris; if a clerk, to the official of the bishopric.\" \"Thank you, sir.\" \"Oh, God!\" said Fleur-de-Lys, \"the poor creature!\" This thought filled with sadness the glance which she cast upon the populace. The captain, much more occupied with her than with that pack of the rabble, was amorously rumpling her girdle behind. She turned round, entreating and smiling. \"Please let me alone, Phoebus! If my mother were to return, she would see your hand!\" At that moment, midday rang slowly out from the clock of Notre-Dame. A murmur of satisfaction broke out in the crowd. The last vibration of the twelfth stroke had hardly died away when all heads surged like the waves beneath a squall, and an immense shout went up from the pavement, the windows, and the roofs, \"There she is!\" Fleur-de-Lys pressed her hands to her eyes, that she might not see. \"Charming girl,\" said Phoebus, \"do you wish to withdraw?\" \"No,\" she replied; and she opened through curiosity, the eyes which she had closed through fear. A tumbrel drawn by a stout Norman horse, and all surrounded by cavalry in violet livery with white crosses, had just debouched upon the Place through the Rue Saint-Pierre- aux-Boeufs. The sergeants of the watch were clearing a passage for it through the crowd, by stout blows from their clubs. Beside the cart rode several officers of justice and police, recognizable by their black costume and their awkwardness in the saddle. Master Jacques Charmolue paraded at their head. In the fatal cart sat a young girl with her arms tied behind her back, and with no priest beside her. She was in her shift; her long black hair (the fashion then was to cut it off only at the foot of the gallows) fell in disorder upon her half-bared throat and shoulders. Athwart that waving hair, more glossy than the plumage of a raven, a thick, rough, gray rope was visible, twisted and knotted, chafing her delicate collar-bones and twining round the charming neck of the poor girl, like an earthworm round a flower. Beneath that rope glittered a tiny amulet ornamented with bits of green glass, which had been left to her no doubt, because nothing is refused to those who are about to die. The spectators in the windows could see in the bottom of the cart her naked legs which she strove to hide beneath her, as by a final feminine instinct. At her feet lay a little goat, bound. The condemned girl held together with her teeth her imperfectly fastened shift. One would have said that she suffered still more in her misery from being thus exposed almost naked to the eyes of all. Alas! modesty is not made for such shocks. \"Jesus!\" said Fleur-de-Lys hastily to the captain. \"Look fair cousin, \u0027tis that wretched Bohemian with the goat.\" So saying, she turned to Phoebus. His eyes were fixed on the tumbrel. He was very pale. \"What Bohemian with the goat?\" he stammered. \"What!\" resumed Fleur-de-Lys, \"do you not remember?\" Phoebus interrupted her. \"I do not know what you mean.\" He made a step to re-enter the room, but Fleur-de-Lys, whose jealousy, previously so vividly aroused by this same gypsy, had just been re-awakened, Fleur-de-Lys gave him a look full of penetration and distrust. She vaguely recalled at that moment having heard of a captain mixed up in the trial of that witch. \"What is the matter with you?\" she said to Phoebus, \"one would say, that this woman had disturbed you.\" Phoebus forced a sneer,-- \"Me! Not the least in the world! Ah! yes, certainly!\" \"Remain, then!\" she continued imperiously, \"and let us see the end.\" The unlucky captain was obliged to remain. He was somewhat reassured by the fact that the condemned girl never removed her eyes from the bottom of the cart. It was but too surely la Esmeralda. In this last stage of opprobrium and misfortune, she was still beautiful; her great black eyes appeared still larger, because of the emaciation of her cheeks; her pale profile was pure and sublime. She resembled what she had been, in the same degree that a virgin by Masaccio, resembles a virgin of Raphael,--weaker, thinner, more delicate. Moreover, there was nothing in her which was not shaken in some sort, and which with the exception of her modesty, she did not let go at will, so profoundly had she been broken by stupor and despair. Her body bounded at every jolt of the tumbrel like a dead or broken thing; her gaze was dull and imbecile. A tear was still visible in her eyes, but motionless and frozen, so to speak. Meanwhile, the lugubrious cavalcade has traversed the crowd amid cries of joy and curious attitudes. But as a faithful historian, we must state that on beholding her so beautiful, so depressed, many were moved with pity, even among the hardest of them. The tumbrel had entered the Parvis. It halted before the central portal. The escort ranged themselves in line on both sides. The crowd became silent, and, in the midst of this silence full of anxiety and solemnity, the two leaves of the grand door swung back, as of themselves, on their hinges, which gave a creak like the sound of a fife. Then there became visible in all its length, the deep, gloomy church, hung in black, sparely lighted with a few candles gleaming afar off on the principal altar, opened in the midst of the Place which was dazzling with light, like the mouth of a cavern. At the very extremity, in the gloom of the apse, a gigantic silver cross was visible against a black drapery which hung from the vault to the pavement. The whole nave was deserted. But a few heads of priests could be seen moving confusedly in the distant choir stalls, and, at the moment when the great door opened, there escaped from the church a loud, solemn, and monotonous chanting, which cast over the head of the condemned girl, in gusts, fragments of melancholy psalms,-- \"~Non timebo millia populi circumdantis me: exsurge, Domine; salvum me fac, Deus~!\" \"~Salvum me fac, Deus, quoniam intraverunt aquoe usque ad animam meam~. \"~Infixus sum in limo profundi; et non est substantia~.\" At the same time, another voice, separate from the choir, intoned upon the steps of the chief altar, this melancholy offertory,- \"~Qui verbum meum audit, et credit ei qui misit me, habet vitam oeternam et in judicium non venit; sed transit a morte im vitam~*.\" * \"He that heareth my word and believeth on Him that sent me, hath eternal life, and hath not come into condemnation; but is passed from death to life.\" This chant, which a few old men buried in the gloom sang from afar over that beautiful creature, full of youth and life, caressed by the warm air of spring, inundated with sunlight was the mass for the dead. The people listened devoutly. The unhappy girl seemed to lose her sight and her consciousness in the obscure interior of the church. Her white lips moved as though in prayer, and the headsman\u0027s assistant who approached to assist her to alight from the cart, heard her repeating this word in a low tone,--\"Phoebus.\" They untied her hands, made her alight, accompanied by her goat, which had also been unbound, and which bleated with joy at finding itself free: and they made her walk barefoot on the hard pavement to the foot of the steps leading to the door. The rope about her neck trailed behind her. One would have said it was a serpent following her. Then the chanting in the church ceased. A great golden cross and a row of wax candles began to move through the gloom. The halberds of the motley beadles clanked; and, a few moments later, a long procession of priests in chasubles, and deacons in dalmatics, marched gravely towards the condemned girl, as they drawled their song, spread out before her view and that of the crowd. But her glance rested on the one who marched at the head, immediately after the cross-bearer. \"Oh!\" she said in a low voice, and with a shudder, \"\u0027tis he again! the priest!\" It was in fact, the archdeacon. On his left he had the sub- chanter, on his right, the chanter, armed with his official wand. He advanced with head thrown back, his eyes fixed and wide open, intoning in a strong voice,-- \"~De ventre inferi clamavi, et exaudisti vocem meam~. \"~Et projecisti me in profundum in corde mans, et flumem circumdedit me~*.\" * \"Out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice. For thou hadst cast me into the deep in the midst of the seas, and the floods compassed me about.\" At the moment when he made his appearance in the full daylight beneath the lofty arched portal, enveloped in an ample cope of silver barred with a black cross, he was so pale that more than one person in the crowd thought that one of the marble bishops who knelt on the sepulchral stones of the choir had risen and was come to receive upon the brink of the tomb, the woman who was about to die. She, no less pale, no less like a statue, had hardly noticed that they had placed in her hand a heavy, lighted candle of yellow wax; she had not heard the yelping voice of the clerk reading the fatal contents of the apology; when they told her to respond with Amen, she responded Amen. She only recovered life and force when she beheld the priest make a sign to her guards to withdraw, and himself advance alone towards her. Then she felt her blood boil in her head, and a remnant of indignation flashed up in that soul already benumbed and cold. The archdeacon approached her slowly; even in that extremity, she beheld him cast an eye sparkling with sensuality, jealousy, and desire, over her exposed form. Then he said aloud,-- \"Young girl, have you asked God\u0027s pardon for your faults and shortcomings?\" He bent down to her ear, and added (the spectators supposed that he was receiving her last confession): \"Will you have me? I can still save you!\" She looked intently at him: \"Begone, demon, or I will denounce you!\" He gave vent to a horrible smile: \"You will not be believed. You will only add a scandal to a crime. Reply quickly! Will you have me?\" \"What have you done with my Phoebus?\" \"He is dead!\" said the priest. At that moment the wretched archdeacon raised his head mechanically and beheld at the other end of the Place, in the balcony of the Gondelaurier mansion, the captain standing beside Fleur-de-Lys. He staggered, passed his hand across his eyes, looked again, muttered a curse, and all his features were violently contorted. \"Well, die then!\" he hissed between his teeth. \"No one shall have you.\" Then, raising his hand over the gypsy, he exclaimed in a funereal voice:--\"~I nunc, anima anceps, et sit tibi Deus misenicors~!\"* * \"Go now, soul, trembling in the balance, and God have mercy upon thee.\" This was the dread formula with which it was the custom to conclude these gloomy ceremonies. It was the signal agreed upon between the priest and the executioner. The crowd knelt. \"~Kyrie eleison~,\"* said the priests, who had remained beneath the arch of the portal. * \"Lord have mercy upon us.\" \"~Kyrie eleison~,\" repeated the throng in that murmur which runs over all heads, like the waves of a troubled sea. \"Amen,\" said the archdeacon. He turned his back on the condemned girl, his head sank upon his breast once more, he crossed his hands and rejoined his escort of priests, and a moment later he was seen to disappear, with the cross, the candles, and the copes, beneath the misty arches of the cathedral, and his sonorous voice was extinguished by degrees in the choir, as he chanted this verse of despair,-- \"~Omnes gurgites tui et fluctus tui super me transierunt.\"* * \"All thy waves and thy billows have gone over me.\" At the same time, the intermittent clash of the iron butts of the beadles\u0027 halberds, gradually dying away among the columns of the nave, produced the effect of a clock hammer striking the last hour of the condemned. The doors of Notre-Dame remained open, allowing a view of the empty desolate church, draped in mourning, without candles, and without voices. The condemned girl remained motionless in her place, waiting to be disposed of. One of the sergeants of police was obliged to notify Master Charmolue of the fact, as the latter, during this entire scene, had been engaged in studying the bas-relief of the grand portal which represents, according to some, the sacrifice of Abraham; according to others, the philosopher\u0027s alchemical operation: the sun being figured forth by the angel; the fire, by the fagot; the artisan, by Abraham. There was considerable difficulty in drawing him away from that contemplation, but at length he turned round; and, at a signal which he gave, two men clad in yellow, the executioner\u0027s assistants, approached the gypsy to bind her hands once more. The unhappy creature, at the moment of mounting once again the fatal cart, and proceeding to her last halting-place, was seized, possibly, with some poignant clinging to life. She raised her dry, red eyes to heaven, to the sun, to the silvery clouds, cut here and there by a blue trapezium or triangle; then she lowered them to objects around her, to the earth, the throng, the houses; all at once, while the yellow man was binding her elbows, she uttered a terrible cry, a cry of joy. Yonder, on that balcony, at the corner of the Place, she had just caught sight of him, of her friend, her lord, Phoebus, the other apparition of her life! The judge had lied! the priest had lied! it was certainly he, she could not doubt it; he was there, handsome, alive, dressed in his brilliant uniform, his plume on his head, his sword by his side! \"Phoebus!\" she cried, \"my Phoebus!\" And she tried to stretch towards him arms trembling with love and rapture, but they were bound. Then she saw the captain frown, a beautiful young girl who was leaning against him gazed at him with disdainful lips and irritated eyes; then Phoebus uttered some words which did not reach her, and both disappeared precipitately behind the window opening upon the balcony, which closed after them. \"Phoebus!\" she cried wildly, \"can it be you believe it?\" A monstrous thought had just presented itself to her. She remembered that she had been condemned to death for murder committed on the person of Phoebus de Chateaupers. She had borne up until that moment. But this last blow was too harsh. She fell lifeless on the pavement. \"Come,\" said Charmolue, \"carry her to the cart, and make an end of it.\" No one had yet observed in the gallery of the statues of the kings, carved directly above the arches of the portal, a strange spectator, who had, up to that time, observed everything with such impassiveness, with a neck so strained, a visage so hideous that, in his motley accoutrement of red and violet, he might have been taken for one of those stone monsters through whose mouths the long gutters of the cathedral have discharged their waters for six hundred years. This spectator had missed nothing that had taken place since midday in front of the portal of Notre-Dame. And at the very beginning he had securely fastened to one of the small columns a large knotted rope, one end of which trailed on the flight of steps below. This being done, he began to look on tranquilly, whistling from time to time when a blackbird flitted past. Suddenly, at the moment when the superintendent\u0027s assistants were preparing to execute Charmolue\u0027s phlegmatic order, he threw his leg over the balustrade of the gallery, seized the rope with his feet, his knees and his hands; then he was seen to glide down the fa?ade, as a drop of rain slips down a window- pane, rush to the two executioners with the swiftness of a cat which has fallen from a roof, knock them down with two enormous fists, pick up the gypsy with one hand, as a child would her doll, and dash back into the church with a single bound, lifting the young girl above his head and crying in a formidable voice,-- \"Sanctuary!\" This was done with such rapidity, that had it taken place at night, the whole of it could have been seen in the space of a single flash of lightning. \"Sanctuary! Sanctuary!\" repeated the crowd; and the clapping of ten thousand hands made Quasimodo\u0027s single eye sparkle with joy and pride. This shock restored the condemned girl to her senses. She raised her eyelids, looked at Quasimodo, then closed them again suddenly, as though terrified by her deliverer. Charmolue was stupefied, as well as the executioners and the entire escort. In fact, within the bounds of Notre-Dame, the condemned girl could not be touched. The cathedral was a place of refuge. All temporal jurisdiction expired upon its threshold. Quasimodo had halted beneath the great portal, his huge feet seemed as solid on the pavement of the church as the heavy Roman pillars. His great, bushy head sat low between his shoulders, like the heads of lions, who also have a mane and no neck. He held the young girl, who was quivering all over, suspended from his horny hands like a white drapery; but he carried her with as much care as though he feared to break her or blight her. One would have said that he felt that she was a delicate, exquisite, precious thing, made for other hands than his. There were moments when he looked as if not daring to touch her, even with his breath. Then, all at once, he would press her forcibly in his arms, against his angular bosom, like his own possession, his treasure, as the mother of that child would have done. His gnome\u0027s eye, fastened upon her, inundated her with tenderness, sadness, and pity, and was suddenly raised filled with lightnings. Then the women laughed and wept, the crowd stamped with enthusiasm, for, at that moment Quasimodo had a beauty of his own. He was handsome; he, that orphan, that foundling, that outcast, he felt himself august and strong, he gazed in the face of that society from which he was banished, and in which he had so powerfully intervened, of that human justice from which he had wrenched its prey, of all those tigers whose jaws were forced to remain empty, of those policemen, those judges, those executioners, of all that force of the king which he, the meanest of creatures, had just broken, with the force of God. And then, it was touching to behold this protection which had fallen from a being so hideous upon a being so unhappy, a creature condemned to death saved by Quasimodo. They were two extremes of natural and social wretchedness, coming into contact and aiding each other. Meanwhile, after several moments of triumph, Quasimodo had plunged abruptly into the church with his burden. The populace, fond of all prowess, sought him with their eyes, beneath the gloomy nave, regretting that he had so speedily disappeared from their acclamations. All at once, he was seen to re-appear at one of the extremities of the gallery of the kings of France; he traversed it, running like a madman, raising his conquest high in his arms and shouting: \"Sanctuary!\" The crowd broke forth into fresh applause. The gallery passed, he plunged once more into the interior of the church. A moment later, he re-appeared upon the upper platform, with the gypsy still in his arms, still running madly, still crying, \"Sanctuary!\" and the throng applauded. Finally, he made his appearance for the third time upon the summit of the tower where hung the great bell; from that point he seemed to be showing to the entire city the girl whom he had saved, and his voice of thunder, that voice which was so rarely heard, and which he never heard himself, repeated thrice with frenzy, even to the clouds: \"Sanctuary! Sanctuary! Sanctuary!\" \"Noel! Noel!\" shouted the populace in its turn; and that immense acclamation flew to astonish the crowd assembled at the Grève on the other bank, and the recluse who was still waiting with her eyes riveted on the gibbet. 当时弗比斯并没有死去，这种男人的生命往往是很顽强的。国王的特别律师菲立浦·勒里耶向拉·爱斯梅拉达说的“他快死了”不过是讲错了话或者是开开玩笑。副主教向那判了刑的人重复说“他死了”，但事实上他根本不知道弗比斯死了没有，不过他以为，他估计，他确信，他希望是那样罢了。 要把关于他的情敌的好消息告诉那个女人，在他是太难啦。任何人处于他的地位也会同样觉得为难的。 弗比斯的伤势并不是不重，不过没有副主教所渲染的那么厉害。军警们一开始把弗比斯抬到外科医生家时，医生担心他只能活一个星期，并且用拉丁话告诉了他。然而年轻力壮占了优势，象通常的情形一样，尽管作了种种诊断和预测，大自然还是乐于通过医生的手挽救病人。躺在外科医生破榻上的那段时期，他受到菲立浦·勒里耶的侦讯和宗教法庭审判官的几次调查，使他觉得非常麻烦。于是在一个晴朗的早晨，当他觉得好些了的时候，他便把金马刺留下当做医药费，悄悄地溜走了。可是这并没有使案件的预审受到什么影响，当时的司法对于罪案很少关心它的准确性，他们需要的只是把犯人绞死，何况法官们又掌握了足够的不利于拉·爱斯梅拉达的证据，他们相信弗比斯一定已经死掉了，这就够啦。 至于弗比斯呢，他并没有逃得很远，不过是回到了他的连队，离巴黎只有几站路的法兰西岛上，在格·昂·勃里镇的驻防军里。 总而言之，他根本不想亲自出庭，他模糊地感到自己在这件案子里不过是个可笑的角色，他根本不知道应该怎样看待整个事件，他只是个头脑简单的军人，不信宗教，同时却又有些迷信。当他想起那件意外发生的事时，对于那只山羊，对于他第一次遇见拉·爱斯梅拉达时的特殊情景，对于她表达爱情的奇怪方式，对于她那埃及女人的气质，最后，对于那个妖僧，他都觉得疑惑不安。他发现在这段经历里巫术的成分倒比恋爱的成分多些，她或许是一个女巫，或许是一个魔鬼吧？那归根到底是一场滑稽戏，或者象当时的说法，一场很乏味的圣迹戏罢了，但他却在其中扮演了一个相当愚蠢的角色，一个被打击和被嘲笑的目标。那个队长为此感到惭愧，他体会到了拉封丹曾经描绘得绝妙的那种羞耻：象一只竟然被母鸡捉去的狐狸那样感到可耻。 而且他希望这件事不要张扬开去，希望只要他不出庭，他的名字就不会被人大声提起，至少不会在杜尔内尔法庭答辩时提起。在这点上他倒是对的，那时候还没有审判公报呢。既然在巴黎的无数次审判中，没有个礼拜不煮死伪币制造者，不绞死女巫，或是不烧死异教徒，人们已经十分习惯于跑到各个公共场所去看年老而封建的代米斯卷起袖子，光着胳膊在绞刑架、梯子和刑台上行使职权，他们对于这些事是满不在乎的。当时的上流社会几乎不知道从街角经过的犯人姓什名谁，全体民众对于这种常见的事更加不在乎了。人们对于死刑的执行，就象对于面包匠的烤炉或屠夫的屠宰场那样已经司空见惯了，他们觉得刽子手只不过比屠夫稍微凶恶些罢了。 因此弗比斯对于女巫拉·爱斯梅拉达——或是象他所说的西米娜——，对于那流浪姑娘或那个妖僧的刺刀（刺刀是谁的他才不认为有什么要紧呢），都觉得心平气和了，不过当他的心灵在这方面感到空虚的时候，孚勒尔·德·丽丝的形象就回到了他的心头，队长的心灵和当时的科学一样都是害怕空虚的。 何况格·昂·勃里那地方枯燥无味，一个住满了铁匠和粗手粗脚的喂牛女人的村庄，一条两边排列着茅屋和砖房的半里长的街道，总之，象条尾巴似的。 孚勒尔·德·丽丝在他的感情里居于倒数第二的地位，她是一个漂亮姑娘，有一笔诱人的嫁妆。在一个晴朗的上午，这个恋爱中的骑士，他的伤口已经痊愈，而且料想流浪姑娘的案件在过了两个月之后也该早已结束并且被人遗忘，便装模作样地去叩贡德洛里耶府邸的大门了。 相当多的人正聚集在巴尔维广场圣母院的大门前，他并没有怎么在意，他记起那正是五月份，他猜想人们是在举行宗教仪式或者在庆祝节日，他把马拴在门环上，便愉快地上了未婚妻家的楼。 她正单独同她的母亲在一起。 她对那女巫到来的情景，她的山羊，她的该死的字母和弗比斯的长久不照面，现在仍然耿耿于怀，但当看见队长走进来，发现他那么漂亮，穿着那么新的军服，系着那么辉煌的肩带，神态那么热情，她就快乐得脸红起来。 那高贵的小姐本人也比向来更加娇媚，她漂亮的金发巧妙地梳成辫子，全身衣服都是适合白净皮肤的天蓝色，那种卖弄风情是高兰布教会了她的，她的眼睛有一种因为爱而感到痛苦的表情，越发显得美妙。 自从在格·昂·勃里驻防以来就没有见过一位漂亮人物的弗比斯被孚勒尔·德·丽丝深深迷住了，这使我们的军官态度殷勤文雅并且心安理得起来。 老是克尽母职地坐在那张大安乐椅中的贡德洛里耶夫人无心去责怪他，至于孚勒尔·德·丽丝的责备呢，当然是消失在喁喁的私语中了。 那姑娘靠墙坐着，仍然一针一线地绣着她那海神奈普顿的岩洞，队长靠在她的椅背上，她低声地撒娇地责备他。 “这两个月你都在干些什么呀，坏东西？” “我向你发誓，”有点被这个问题窘住了的弗比斯回答道，“你美得简直令一位主教都不能不吃惊呢。” 她忍不住笑起来。 “这可好，这可好，先生，丢开我的美貌，回答我的话吧。扯什么美貌呀，真是！” “哎呀，亲爱的表妹，我被叫到驻防军里去了。” “请你告诉我，那是在什么地方？你为什么不来向我告别呢？” “在格·昂·勃里。” 弗比斯很庆幸前半句问话帮助他避开了后半句。 “不过那是很近的呀，为什么你连一次都不来看我？” 这可使弗比斯相当不知所措了。“那是因为……职务……而且，可爱的表妹，我生病了呢。” “病了！”她吓了一跳。 “是呀，……受伤了。” “受伤了！” 可怜的姑娘简直惊呆了。 “啊，你可别为这件事生气，”弗比斯满不在乎地说，“那算不了什么，不过是一次口角，一场决斗，那同你有什么关系呢？” “同我有什么关系！”孚勒尔·德·丽丝抬起含泪的眼睛嚷道，“啊，你简直不明白你在说些什么。那场决斗是怎么回事？我愿意知道真象。” “哎呀！亲爱的美人！我同马代·费狄吵了一架，你知道吗？他是圣日耳曼·盎·来伊的陆军中尉，我们彼此在对方皮肤上弄出了一点伤痕，不过是这么点事。” 那撒谎的队长十分明白，光荣的负伤会使一个男子在女人眼中显得特别出色。孚勒尔·德·丽丝真的用又感动、又害怕、又高兴、又赞赏的眼光直望着他的脸，不过她还没有十分安心。 “幸好你已经痊愈了，我的弗比斯！”她说道，“我不认识你那个马代·费狄，可是他一定是个无赖汉。为什么吵起来的呢？” 到此，想象力并不怎么丰富的弗比斯便不知该怎样替自己解围了。 “啊，我怎么知道……? 由于一点小事，由于一匹马，一句闲话！好表妹，”为了改换话题，他喊道，“巴尔维广场上为什么闹哄哄的呀？” 他走到窗前去。“啊，我的上帝，表妹，广场上有好多人呢！” “我不知道，”孚勒尔·德·丽丝说，“今天上午好象有一个女巫要在教堂前面忏悔，然后去受绞刑。” 队长认为拉·爱斯梅拉达的案子早已了结，听了孚勒尔·德·丽丝的话完全无动于衷，这当儿他向她提出了一两个问题。 “那女巫叫什么名字？” “我不知道。”她回答道。 “他们说她干了什么呢？” 这一回她依旧只是耸了一下雪白的肩膀：“我不知道。” “啊，我的上帝！”那位母亲说道，“现在女巫真多呀，我想，人们根本不知道她们叫什么名字就把她们烧死了。想要知道她们的名字就和想要知道天上每朵云彩的名字一样难呢。不过，我们尽管放心好了，反正有好心的上帝掌管生死簿。”那位贵妇人说到这里便站起来走到窗前。“主啊！”她说道，“你说得对，弗比斯，有好大一群人呢。感谢上帝，连屋顶上都挤满了人！你可知道，弗比斯，这使我想起我年轻的时候，在国王查理七世进京的时候，也有许许多多的人，我记不清是哪一年了。我向你说起的事，在你看来那是相当陈旧的了，在我看来却还是相当新鲜，不是吗？啊，那时的人可比现在还多得多，连圣安东尼城门的城垛上都挤满了人，国王的马后面坐着王后，紧跟着是贵妇们坐在爵士们的马后边。我记得他们都在大笑，因为身材矮小的阿马里翁·加尔兰德的身边是身材魁梧的骑士马特法隆先生，他曾杀死过成群的英格兰人呢，那才真真好看呢！法兰西所有的上等人都排成行列，他们的旗帜象波浪一般在空中飘动，有三角形的矛头旗，也有军旗。 若望·德·夏多莫韩拿着军旗，古西爵士拿着军旗，除了波旁公爵之外，全都精神抖擞……哎！想到当年的盛况如今全都没有了，真是可悲呢！” 那一对爱侣可没听贵族老寡妇的话，弗比斯靠在未婚妻的椅背上，那是个迷人的位置，他可以从那里自由自在地把眼光射到孚勒尔·德·丽丝的颈饰的全部开口处，领口开得那么大，好象就是为了让他看见那美妙的部分，让他去猜想其余的部分似的。那绸缎般光泽的皮肤使弗比斯感到眼花缭乱，他自言自语地说道：“除了爱一个白净的美人之外还能爱什么人呢？”他俩依旧默默不语，那姑娘时时抬起温柔的笑眯眯的眼睛看他，她的头发同春天的阳光交融在一起。 “弗比斯，”孚勒尔·德·丽丝突然低声说道，“再过三个月我们就要结婚了，向我发誓说你除了我之外没有爱过别的人吧。” “我向你发誓的确如此，美丽的天使！”弗比斯回答道，他那热情的眼光加上着重的声调，使孚勒尔·德·丽丝完全相信了，当时或许连他自己也是相信的呢。 这时那位善良的母亲看见未婚夫妇那种心心相印的神态，简直高兴极了，便走出房间去安排家务。弗比斯看见她离开，那种寂静无人的场合鼓舞了喜欢冒险的队长，使他脑子里产生了非常奇怪的念头。孚勒尔·德·丽丝爱他，她是他的未婚妻，此刻又单独和他在一起，他以往对她的兴趣已经复活，她还是那样鲜艳，那样热情，总之，提早尝一尝他那尚未成熟的麦子，该不是什么大不了的罪过吧！不知他心中是否掠过了这些念头，但孚勒尔·德·丽丝突然被他眼中的表情骇住了却是事实，她向周围看看，偏偏她母亲不在跟前了。 “我的上帝！”她脸红红地不安地说，“我好热！” “我想是吧，”弗比斯回答道，“快到中午了，阳光挺厉害，不如把帷幔拉拢来。” “不用，不用，”那可怜的姑娘喊道，“我倒需要空气呢。” 正象牝鹿听到了猎狗的呼吸，她站起来跑到窗前，把窗门打开，到了阳台上。 弗比斯很不乐意地跟在她后面。 阳台朝向巴尔维广场，这时广场上出现了悲惨奇怪的场面，使胆小的孚勒尔·德·丽丝突然害怕起来。 一大群人把那个广场四周挤得水泄不通，还把邻近的街道也挤满了。围着巴尔维广场的那道矮墙，要不是有那二百二十个军警和火绳枪手拿着刀枪一层层地排列在那里，可能早就被挤塌了，幸好有这刀山剑林挡住，巴尔维广场上还是空空的，进口处由主教的一队高大的执戟士卒把守着。教堂每道大门都关得紧紧的，相反，广场上无数房屋的窗户却大大敞开，成千的脑袋重重叠叠地挤在窗口，差不多就象是炮弹制造厂里的一堆堆炮弹。 这群人脸色灰暗肮脏，他们所期待的场景显然具有把平民中最被人嫌弃的人召集拢来的特别威力，没有什么能比这些黄帽子乱头发的人发出的喧闹声更可怕的了，在这群人里面，笑声比哭声多，男人比女人多。 间或有些发颤的尖嗓音从这一片喧闹声里透出来。 “嗨，马耶·巴里孚尔！是不是要把她在这里绞死？” “笨蛋！是在这里，只穿着衬衫进行忏悔！好上帝要用拉丁话当面咒骂她呢！这种事情向来都是中午在这里举行的。假若你是想看绞刑的执行，那就到格雷沃广场去吧。” “过后我是要去的。” “说呀，布刚勃里，她真的拒绝了一位忏悔神甫吗？” “好象是那样的，拉·倍歇尼。” “你瞧，她是异教徒呀！” “先生，这是习俗如此，法官一定得把判了刑的犯人交付行刑。要是个俗人，就交给巴黎总督，要是个教士，就交给宗教法庭审判官。” “我谢谢你，先生。” “啊，我的上帝！”孚勒尔·德·丽丝说道，“那可怜的人！” 这个想法使她望着人群的眼光充满了痛苦。队长根本没注意那些人，一心只在她身上，这时便从后面爱恋地抱住了她的腰，她回过头来微笑着恳求道：“放开我吧，弗比斯！要是我母亲转来，她会看见你的手呢！” 这时圣母院的大钟慢慢地敲了十二点，人群里发出一片满意的低语。十二下钟声还没有完全停住，人们的脑袋就象被风吹动的波浪一般骚动起来，石板路上窗口上和屋顶上发出一片巨大的呼喊：“她来啦！” 孚勒尔·德·丽丝用双手把眼睛捂起来。 “可爱的人，你想进屋去吗？” “不，”她回答道，她刚才因为害怕而闭上了的眼睛，又因为好奇而睁开了。 一辆由诺曼底栗色马驾着的两轮载重马车，被几个穿着胸前缀有白十字紫红制服的骑兵包围着，从圣比埃尔·俄·倍甫街进入广场，军警们使劲挥着鞭子在人群中替他们开路，车旁走着一些骑马的法官和警官，从他们的黑制服和在马上耀武扬威的姿势就可以分辨出来。雅克·沙尔莫吕威风凛凛地走在他们前头。 那不祥的马车里坐着一个姑娘，她两手反绑在背后，身边没有神甫。她只穿着衬衫，长长的黑头发（照当时的规矩，要到了绞刑架跟前才剪掉）蓬乱地披在她的脖子上和半裸的肩膀上。 一条灰色的多结的粗绳子，象蚯蚓爬在花朵上一般套在那不幸姑娘的脖子上，摩擦着她细腻的皮肤，穿过她那比乌鸦羽毛还黑亮的波浪般的头发露在外面。那条绳子下面闪亮着一个装着绿玻璃片的小小的护身符，显然是由于不便拒绝快死的人的要求才给她留下了的。窗口上的观众还看得见车子里面她的赤裸的腿，好象出于女性的最后的本能，她总想把腿缩在身子底下。 有一只山羊绑在她的脚边。那罪人用牙齿咬住没有扣好的衬衣，在那种悲惨的情况下，她好象还因为几乎在众人眼前赤身露体而觉得难为情呢。哎，羞耻心可不是为了这样的颤抖才产生的啊。 “耶稣啊，”孚勒尔·德·丽丝激动地向队长说道，“看呀，表哥！原来是那个带着山羊的流浪姑娘！” 她一面说一面向弗比斯转过身来，发现他的眼睛正盯在囚车上，脸色非常苍白。 “哪一个带着山羊的流浪姑娘呀！”他结结巴巴地问道。 “怎么！”孚勒尔·德·丽丝说，“你不记得了吗……? ” 弗比斯打断她的话说道：“我不懂你的话是什么意思。” 他迈了一步想进屋去，可是孚勒尔·德·丽丝不久前被那埃及姑娘刺激过的妒嫉心这时又苏醒了，使用充满不信任的洞察一切的眼光向他看了一眼，这时她忽然模糊地记起曾经听人讲过某个队长同那女巫的案子有牵连。 “你怎么啦？”她向弗比斯说道，“别人会当那个女人使你不安呢。” 弗比斯勉强傻笑了一下。 “我吗！绝对不会！” “那么留在这里，”她命令道，“一直看到终了。” 队长被迫停留在那里，他看见囚犯一直把眼睛盯着囚车的底板，才稍稍觉得安心一点。那当然是爱斯梅拉达，在不幸和羞辱的最后时刻，她依然那么美，由于双颊瘦得陷了进去，一双大黑眼睛就显得更大，发青的脸面又纯洁又崇高。她还是和从前一样，就象马沙西奥所画的圣母以及拉斐尔所画的圣母那样，不过更为纤细，更为单薄，更为消瘦。 而且，除开羞耻心之外，她一切都听其自然，她是深深地被昏迷与失望伤害了，囚车每颠簸一下，她都象一个死了的或摔破了的物件那样蹦一下，她的眼光又凄凉又呆滞，人们还看见她眼中含着一颗泪珠，可是，好象冻结了一般。 这时凄惨的马队穿过了欢呼的奇形怪状的人群。可是作为诚实的说书人，我们还得说明，看见她那么美那么孤独，大部分的人，那怕心肠最硬的，都产生了怜悯。这时囚车进入巴尔维广场来了。 囚车在教堂正中那道大门前面停下来，押解队的人分立两旁，人们鸦雀无声。在这充满庄严与不安的寂静中，那大门的两个门扇自动打开来，铰链发出笛子般的声响，于是人们一直看到教堂的最里面，那里很阴暗，挂着帷幔，在主神坛上有几支蜡烛闪着微光。这座教堂象一个洞那样，开在阳光灿烂的广场的中央。人们可以看到在教堂最里面半圆形后殿阴暗的地方有一个很大的银十字架，衬在一幅从拱顶垂到地面的黑色帷幔上。整个本堂里空无一人，但是人们看到在远处唱诗室的神甫座位上有几个头在来回转动，大门打开的时候，教堂里便升起一片庄严、响亮、单调的歌声，悲凉的赞美诗的片段好象被疾风吹送着落到了那囚犯的头上：……我绝不怕包围我的人们。主啊，求你起来，救救我吧。 ……救救我吧，主啊，因为众水要淹没我。 ……我陷在深淤泥中，没有立脚之地。 在合唱之外，同时有另一种声音在主神坛的梯级上唱着这支悲哀的献歌：谁能听到我的话并深信我派来的人，谁能长生不老，不受审判，并且死而复生。 在远处阴暗的地方老人们唱的这支歌飘向这个充满青春与活力、被春天温暖空气爱抚着的、被阳光照满全身的漂亮人儿的头上，这是为死人唱的弥撒曲。 人们虔诚地倾听着。 那不幸的姑娘惊惶失措，好象她的生命和她的思想都落到了那教堂的黑暗的深处，她苍白的嘴唇动了几下，好象是在祷告。当刽子手的助手走到她跟前把她拽下囚车时，听到她低声地重复说着：“弗比斯”。 人们给她的双手松了绑，也把小山羊松了绑，让它跟着她下车。因为感到自由了，它咩咩地叫着。人们让她赤脚踏着冰冷的石板路走到大门前的石阶下面，她脖子上的粗绳子拖在背后，仿佛一条蛇跟在她身后似的。 教堂里的歌声突然中断了，一个巨大的金十字架和一串蜡烛在黑暗中移动起来，穿着彩色服装的教堂侍卫手中的铁戟铿锵作响。过了一会，穿袈裟的神甫们和穿礼服的祭司们唱着赞美歌庄严地向囚犯走来，在那囚犯和群众的面前排成长队，可是她的眼光停在十字架后面带头的那个神甫身上。“啊，” 她颤抖着低声说道，“又是他呀，那个神甫！” 那的确是副主教，他左边是副歌手，右边是拿指挥棍的歌手。他昂着头，睁着呆定定的眼睛，高声歌唱着往前行进：我从阴间的深处呼求，你就俯听我的声音。 你将我投下深渊，就是海的深处，大水环绕我。 当身穿宽大的银色袈裟胸前绣着黑十字的神甫脸色非常苍白地出现在教堂高大的尖拱形大门廊里时，不止一人以为他是跪在唱诗室墓石上的大理石主教雕像里的一个，他站起身来为的是到阳光下来把那快死的人带往冥界去。 她也是如同石像一般苍白，有人把一支点燃的黄蜡烛递到她的手中，她也几乎没有觉察，她没有听见书记官尖声念诵要命的忏悔文，别人叫她回答“阿门”，她便照样回答。可是看见那个神甫叫看守她的人站开去，独自向她走过来的时候，她却恢复了一点生气和力量。 她觉得血液在头脑里翻涌，她那已经冷却的无力的灵魂又重新燃起了愤怒之火。 副主教慢吞吞地走到她跟前，到了这种时刻，她看见他居然还用闪着淫欲妒嫉和希望的眼光扫视她半裸的身体，随后他高声问道：“姑娘，你请求上帝宽恕你的错误和罪恶了吗？”随后他又凑到她的耳边（旁观的人还以为那是在听取她最后的忏悔呢）说道：“你愿意要我吗？我还能够救你。” 她盯住他说道：“滚开，恶魔！要不然我就揭发你！” 他恶狠狠地笑了一笑：“别人不会相信你的话，那不过是在一个罪名之上再加一个诽谤的罪名罢了。快回答！你愿意要我吗？” “你把我的弗比斯怎么样了？” “他死掉了。”神甫说。 正在这时候，倒霉的副主教机械地抬起头来，望见在广场那一头贡德洛里耶府邸的阳台上，那个队长正挺立在孚勒尔·德·丽丝身边。他摇晃了一下，把手搭在额头上又望了一会，低声骂了一句，整个脸孔都皱缩成一团。 “得啦，你死吧！”他咬牙切齿地说，“谁也别想得到你。” 于是他把手放在那埃及姑娘头上，用阴惨惨的声音大声说道：“现在来吧，罪恶的灵魂，上帝会怜悯你！” 这是通常用来结束这种凄惨的仪式的语句，这是神甫给刽子手的暗号。 人们都跪下来了。 “主啊，请宽恕我。”依旧站在大门道尖拱下的神甫们念道。 “主啊，请宽恕我。”人们跟着念了一遍，他们的声音升起在他们的头顶，好象骚动的大海在咆哮。 “阿门，”副主教说道。 他在犯人身旁背过身去，脑袋耷拉在胸前，双手合十，走进了神甫们的行列，过一会就同那个十字架、那些蜡烛和袈裟一齐消失在教堂里那些阴暗的拱顶下面了。他唱着下面这句悲伤的诗句，声音愈来愈听不清楚：你的波浪洪涛，都漫过我身。 同时，教堂侍卫执着的铁戟柄的那种断断续续的响声也在本堂的柱廊间逐渐低了下去，好象钟锤一样，在给犯人敲着最后的丧钟。 这时圣母院的每道大门依旧开着，望得见教堂里空无一人，没有烛光也没有声音，教堂里充满了阴森的气息。 那个囚犯依旧待在原处不动，等候着人们来处置她。一个执事不得不跑去通知沙尔莫吕阁下，在刚才那整段时间里，他都在研究大门拱顶上的浮雕，它们有的刻着亚伯拉罕的牺牲，有的刻着炼金术的实验，天使代表太阳，柴捆代表火焰，亚伯拉罕代表做实验的人。 费了好大劲才把他从那专心致志的状态中唤醒，他终于回转身来，向刽子手的两个助手——两个穿黄衣服的家伙——做了个手势，要他们把埃及姑娘的双手重新绑上。 那不幸的姑娘重新去上车，当她向她的终点走去时，心头或许产生了对生命悲痛的惋惜吧。她抬起干涩发红的眼睛望着天空，望着太阳，望着到处把天空截成蓝色四边形或三角形的白云，随后她又低下眼睛向四周望去，望着大地，人群，房屋……忽然，正当那穿黄衣服的人来绑她双手的时候，她发出了一声可怕的呼喊，一声欢乐的呼喊。就在那边广场拐角的阳台上，她刚才发现了他，她的朋友，她的主宰，她的弗比斯，仍然好好地活着呢！法官们撒了谎！那个神甫撒了谎！那的确是他呀，她不能不相信，他在那里，那么漂亮，生气勃勃，穿着他那辉煌的军服，头上戴着翎毛，腰上佩着宝剑！ “弗比斯！”她喊道，“我的弗比斯！” 她想朝他伸出由于爱情和欢乐而战栗的手臂，可是手臂已经被绑上了。 这时她看见队长皱起眉头，一个漂亮姑娘倚在他身边，轻蔑地撅着嘴，眼睛激怒地盯着他。随后弗比斯说了几句她从远处无法听见的话，两人便飞快地一起躲进了阳台的大玻璃门里，把门关上了。 “弗比斯！”她疯狂地喊道，“难道连你也相信了吗？” 一个奇怪的念头出现在她的脑子里，她记起她是被认为谋杀了弗比斯·德·沙多倍尔才被判了刑的。 那时以前她一直都还勉强撑持着，可是这最后一个打击太厉害了，她倒在石板路上不动了。 “来呀，”沙尔莫吕说，“把她抬上囚车，了结这件事吧！” 还没有人注意到，在大门尖拱顶上那些历代君王的雕像之间，有一个奇怪的旁观者一直非常冷静地在那里观看，他脖子弯得很低，相貌很丑陋，要不是穿着半红半紫的衣服，","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/264/2543.html","bookId":227,"book":{"id":227,"title":"巴黎圣母院 Notre-Dame de Paris","description":"简介： 丑聋人卡西莫多被巴黎圣母院的神父克洛德收养，做撞钟人，外貌正经的克洛德神父自从遇见美丽的吉普赛少女爱斯美拉达后，被其美色所诱而神魂颠倒，指使卡西莫多强行掳走爱斯美...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/110326/1-110326125SJ96.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/264","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM"}}
