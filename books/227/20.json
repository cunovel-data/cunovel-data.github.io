{"id":6988,"no":20,"title":"Book 4 Chapter 4 The Dog And His Master","content":"Nevertheless, there was one human creature whom Quasimodo excepted from his malice and from his hatred for others, and whom he loved even more, perhaps, than his cathedral: this was Claude Frollo.\n The matter was simple; Claude Frollo had taken him in, had adopted him, had nourished him, had reared him. When a little lad, it was between Claude Frollo\u0027s legs that he was accustomed to seek refuge, when the dogs and the children barked after him. Claude Frollo had taught him to talk, to read, to write. Claude Frollo had finally made him the bellringer. Now, to give the big bell in marriage to Quasimodo was to give Juliet to Romeo.\n Hence Quasimodo\u0027s gratitude was profound, passionate, boundless; and although the visage of his adopted father was often clouded or severe, although his speech was habitually curt, harsh, imperious, that gratitude never wavered for a single moment. The archdeacon had in Quasimodo the most submissive slave, the most docile lackey, the most vigilant of dogs. When the poor bellringer became deaf, there had been established between him and Claude Frollo, a language of signs, mysterious and understood by themselves alone. In this manner the archdeacon was the sole human being with whom Quasimodo had preserved communication. He was in sympathy with but two things in this world: Notre- Dame and Claude Frollo.\n There is nothing which can be compared with the empire of the archdeacon over the bellringer; with the attachment of the bellringer for the archdeacon. A sign from Claude and the idea of giving him pleasure would have sufficed to make Quasimodo hurl himself headlong from the summit of Notre- Dame. It was a remarkable thing--all that physical strength which had reached in Quasimodo such an extraordinary development, and which was placed by him blindly at the disposition of another. There was in it, no doubt, filial devotion, domestic attachment; there was also the fascination of one spirit by another spirit. It was a poor, awkward, and clumsy organization, which stood with lowered head and supplicating eyes before a lofty and profound, a powerful and superior intellect. Lastly, and above all, it was gratitude. Gratitude so pushed to its extremest limit, that we do not know to what to compare it. This virtue is not one of those of which the finest examples are to be met with among men. We will say then, that Quasimodo loved the archdeacon as never a dog, never a horse, never an elephant loved his master.\n \n 但是也有一个人是在伽西莫多对人的憎恨之外的，他非常爱他，也许比爱教堂更甚，这个人便是克洛德·孚罗洛。\n 事情很简单，克洛德曾经收养他，给他洗礼，找奶娘奶他，教育他长大成人。很小的时候，他总是在克洛德的腿膝间躲避那些跟在他身后叫喊的狗和儿童。克洛德· 孚罗洛教他说话，教他念书，教他写字。克洛德·孚罗洛最后还让他当了敲钟人。把那口大钟嫁给了伽西莫多，简直象是把朱丽叶嫁给了罗米欧呢。\n 伽西莫多的报答也是深厚的、热情的、无边的，虽然他义父的脸孔有时候又阴沉又严厉，虽然他的话有时既简短又生硬，简直不堪忍受，但这种报答却没有一刻不支配着他。他对于副主教好象一个最卑微的奴仆，最温顺的侍者，最机警的卫士。可怜的敲钟人耳朵聋了之后，他和克洛德之间就建立了只有他俩才懂得的神秘的手语，这样一来，副主教就成了伽西莫多唯一可以交谈的人了。他在这个世界里只同两件事物有联系，那便是圣母院和克洛德·孚罗洛。\n 副主教在敲钟人心里的权威以及敲钟人对于副主教的依恋，都是无可比拟的。只要克洛德做一个手势，或者是伽西莫多产生了一个想使克洛德高兴的念头，就足以让伽西莫多从高高的钟塔顶上纵身跳下。看到伽西莫多身上发展得十分奇特的精力竟会盲目地听从另一个人的吩咐，真是令人惊讶。这一定是出自维持家族关系的那种儿子的孝心，也是出自一个心灵对另一个心灵的迷恋。这是一个可怜的、畸形的、残缺的人在一个深刻、能干、高贵的人物面前低下头颅，眼里充满乞怜的目光。最后，是这一切里最主要的原因，这是一种报恩思想，一种我们无法比拟的发展到了顶点的报恩思想。这种情况在常人中间找不出例子，我们可以这么说，伽西莫多对副主教的爱，比一切犬马对它们主人的爱更为深厚。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/264/2520.html","bookId":227,"book":{"id":227,"title":"巴黎圣母院 Notre-Dame de Paris","description":"简介： 丑聋人卡西莫多被巴黎圣母院的神父克洛德收养，做撞钟人，外貌正经的克洛德神父自从遇见美丽的吉普赛少女爱斯美拉达后，被其美色所诱而神魂颠倒，指使卡西莫多强行掳走爱斯美...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/110326/1-110326125SJ96.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/264","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM"}}
