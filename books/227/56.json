{"id":7024,"no":56,"title":"Book 10 Chapter 7 Chateaupers To The Rescue","content":"The reader will, perhaps, recall the critical situation in which we left Quasimodo. The brave deaf man, assailed on all sides, had lost, if not all courage, at least all hope of saving, not himself (he was not thinking of himself), but the gypsy. He ran distractedly along the gallery. Notre-Dame was on the point of being taken by storm by the outcasts. All at once, a great galloping of horses filled the neighboring streets, and, with a long file of torches and a thick column of cavaliers, with free reins and lances in rest, these furious sounds debouched on the Place like a hurricane,-- \"France! France! cut down the louts! Chateaupers to the rescue! Provostship! Provostship!\" The frightened vagabonds wheeled round. Quasimodo who did not hear, saw the naked swords, the torches, the irons of the pikes, all that cavalry, at the head of which he recognized Captain Phoebus; he beheld the confusion of the outcasts, the terror of some, the disturbance among the bravest of them, and from this unexpected succor he recovered so much strength, that he hurled from the church the first assailants who were already climbing into the gallery. It was, in fact, the king\u0027s troops who had arrived. The vagabonds behaved bravely. They defended themselves like desperate men. Caught on the flank, by the Rue Saint- Pierre-aux-Boeufs, and in the rear through the Rue du Parvis, driven to bay against Notre-Dame, which they still assailed and Quasimodo defended, at the same time besiegers and besieged, they were in the singular situation in which Comte Henri Harcourt, ~Taurinum obsessor idem et obsessus~, as his epitaph says, found himself later on, at the famous siege of Turin, in 1640, between Prince Thomas of Savoy, whom he was besieging, and the Marquis de Leganez, who was blockading him. The battle was frightful. There was a dog\u0027s tooth for wolf\u0027s flesh, as P. Mathieu says. The king\u0027s cavaliers, in whose midst Phoebus de Chateaupers bore himself valiantly, gave no quarter, and the slash of the sword disposed of those who escaped the thrust of the lance. The outcasts, badly armed foamed and bit with rage. Men, women, children, hurled themselves on the cruppers and the breasts of the horses, and hung there like cats, with teeth, finger nails and toe nails. Others struck the archers\u0027 in the face with their torches. Others thrust iron hooks into the necks of the cavaliers and dragged them down. They slashed in pieces those who fell. One was noticed who had a large, glittering scythe, and who, for a long time, mowed the legs of the horses. He was frightful. He was singing a ditty, with a nasal intonation, he swung and drew back his scythe incessantly. At every blow he traced around him a great circle of severed limbs. He advanced thus into the very thickest of the cavalry, with the tranquil slowness, the lolling of the head and the regular breathing of a harvester attacking a field of wheat. It was Chopin Trouillefou. A shot from an arquebus laid him low. In the meantime, windows had been opened again. The neighbors hearing the war cries of the king\u0027s troops, had mingled in the affray, and bullets rained upon the outcasts from every story. The Parvis was filled with a thick smoke, which the musketry streaked with flame. Through it one could confusedly distinguish the front of Notre-Dame, and the decrepit H?tel-Dieu with some wan invalids gazing down from the heights of its roof all checkered with dormer windows. At length the vagabonds gave way. Weariness, the lack of good weapons, the fright of this surprise, the musketry from the windows, the valiant attack of the king\u0027s troops, all overwhelmed them. They forced the line of assailants, and fled in every direction, leaving the Parvis encumbered with dead. When Quasimodo, who had not ceased to fight for a moment, beheld this rout, he fell on his knees and raised his hands to heaven; then, intoxicated with joy, he ran, he ascended with the swiftness of a bird to that cell, the approaches to which he had so intrepidly defended. He had but one thought now; it was to kneel before her whom he had just saved for the second time. When he entered the cell, he found it empty. 读者可能还记得伽西莫多的危急情况吧。那勇敢的聋子四面受到围攻，虽然并没丧失勇气，至少已经失掉援救那埃及姑娘的希望了，关于自己的危险他倒没有怎么考虑，他疯狂地在那楼廊上跑来跑去，圣母院眼看就要被乞丐们攻破哪。忽然邻近的街上响起一片马蹄声，还有一长串火把，一队密集的拿着长枪勒着马的骑兵，怒吼声象一阵风似的刮进了广场：“法兰西！法兰西！砍死平民！沙多倍尔来支援了！宪兵司令！宪兵司令！” 乞丐们吓得团团转。 伽西莫多听不见喊声，只看到那些雪亮的刀，那些火把，那些戈矛和整个骑兵队，他认得带队的正是弗比斯队长。他看见乞丐们骚乱起来，有些人惊呆了，大胆些的也惊慌失措。这支意外的救兵使他恢复了勇气，他把已经踏上楼廊的头几个进攻者抓住，扔了出去。 真是国王的军队突然来到啦。 乞丐们十分英勇，他们在失望中进行自卫，把圣比埃尔·俄·倍甫街上的队伍当做侧翼，把巴尔维广场当做后卫，背着巴黎圣母院，他们依然在这里进攻，伽西莫多依然在抵抗，他们处在一个奇特的位置，既是进攻的人又是被围的人，正象一六四○年“居罕之战”一役那样，亨利·达果尔伯爵处在被他围攻的萨瓦省的多玛王子和围攻他的勒加奈侯爵之间，正象他的墓志铭上所说“围攻居罕的人自己被围攻了”。 这场混战真是骇人，正象蒲·马蒂厄斯所说的“狗牙咬住了狼肉”。在英勇的弗比斯·德·沙多倍尔指挥下的骑兵们，一步也不放松，才逃过他们前锋的人，又被他们的侧翼击倒了。拿着劣等兵器的乞丐激怒得咬着嘴唇，男人女人和孩子都扑倒在马后和马肚子下面，象猫一般用牙齿去咬，用指甲去抓马腿。有些人把火炬朝那些弓箭手的脸上扔去，有些人把铁钩向骑兵们的脖子上刺去，把他们钩到跟前，他们把那些落马的人砍成碎块。 只见一个男人拿着雪亮的大刀不停地砍着马腿，样子非常可怕，他哼着一首歌曲，声音发齆，把他的大刀砍出去又收回来。每砍一刀，他四周的地上就落下一大堆马腿，他就这样不慌不忙地杀进骑兵队当中，脑袋一俯一仰，象农民割麦子一般，呼吸很均匀。这人就是克洛潘·图意弗，一支火绳枪把他击中了。 这时那些窗户都打开了，附近的居民听到近卫军的喊声，也参加了战斗，子弹从每座楼的窗口里象雨点般落到乞丐那里，巴尔维广场上升起一阵枪炮的浓烟。但人们还是看得见圣母院的前墙，也能看到衰朽的大医院，许多苍白的病人从医院屋顶上那些窗口里探出头来。 最后，乞丐们只好让步了，疲劳，缺乏良好武器，对突然袭击的惊恐，窗口上的火绳枪，近卫军的猛烈攻击，这一切都使他们遭受挫败，他们冲出包围圈，开始四散奔逃，留下一大堆尸体在巴尔维广场上。 一刻也没停止过抵抗的伽西莫多，看见围攻的人败退了，便双膝跪下，向天空举起双手，随后便高兴得昏昏沉沉地跑开了，他用飞鸟般的速度跑上了他一直那么英勇地保卫着不让人挨近的小房间去，此刻他只有一个念头：去跪在他刚才第二次搭救了的姑娘面前。 他走进那个小房间，却发现房间里空无一人。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/264/2556.html","bookId":227,"book":{"id":227,"title":"巴黎圣母院 Notre-Dame de Paris","description":"简介： 丑聋人卡西莫多被巴黎圣母院的神父克洛德收养，做撞钟人，外貌正经的克洛德神父自从遇见美丽的吉普赛少女爱斯美拉达后，被其美色所诱而神魂颠倒，指使卡西莫多强行掳走爱斯美...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/110326/1-110326125SJ96.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/264","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM"}}
