{"id":6969,"no":1,"title":"Preface","content":"Notre-Dame de Paris\n Also known as:\n The Hunchback of Notre Dame\n by Victor Hugo\n A few years ago, while visiting or, rather, rummaging about Notre-Dame, the author of this book found, in an obscure nook of one of the towers, the following word, engraved by hand upon the wall:--\n ~ANArKH~.\n These Greek capitals, black with age, and quite deeply graven in the stone, with I know not what signs peculiar to Gothic caligraphy imprinted upon their forms and upon their attitudes, as though with the purpose of revealing that it had been a hand of the Middle Ages which had inscribed them there, and especially the fatal and melancholy meaning contained in them, struck the author deeply.\n He questioned himself; he sought to divine who could have been that soul in torment which had not been willing to quit this world without leaving this stigma of crime or unhappiness upon the brow of the ancient church.\n Afterwards, the wall was whitewashed or scraped down, I know not which, and the inscription disappeared. For it is thus that people have been in the habit of proceeding with the marvellous churches of the Middle Ages for the last two hundred years. Mutilations come to them from every quarter, from within as well as from without. The priest whitewashes them, the archdeacon scrapes them down; then the populace arrives and demolishes them.\n Thus, with the exception of the fragile memory which the author of this book here consecrates to it, there remains to-day nothing whatever of the mysterious word engraved within the gloomy tower of Notre-Dame,--nothing of the destiny which it so sadly summed up. The man who wrote that word upon the wall disappeared from the midst of the generations of man many centuries ago; the word, in its turn, has been effaced from the wall of the church; the church will, perhaps, itself soon disappear from the face of the earth.\n It is upon this word that this book is founded.\n March, 1831.\n ’ANA ΓKH\n 这几个由于年深日久而发黑并且相当深地嵌进石头里的大写希腊字母，它们那种哥特字体的奇怪式样和笔法不知标志着什么，仿佛是叫人明白那是一个中世纪的人的手迹。这些字母所蕴含的悲惨的、宿命的意味，深深地打动了作者。\n 他多方寻思，尽力猜测那痛苦的灵魂是谁，他为什么一定要把这个罪恶的或悲惨的印记留在古老教堂的额角上之后才肯离开人世。\n 在那以后，人们又粉刷过或者打磨过这堵墙，已经弄不清究竟是哪一种原因，字迹就不见了。因为近两百年来，人们就是如此这般地处置这些卓绝的中世纪教堂的。它们通体都遭受过摧残，内部的残破程度和外表上差不多。\n 神甫粉刷它们，建筑师打磨它们，随后是民众来把它们拆毁。\n 因此，关于刻在圣母院幽暗的钟塔角落上的神秘的单词，连同本书作者悲伤地叙述的那个一向无人知晓的不走运的人物，除了作者在这里提供的一点脆弱的回忆之外，再没有留下什么痕迹了。几个世纪以前在墙上写下这个单词的人已经不在了，永远不在了。也该轮到这个单词从教堂的额角上消失了。这座教堂本身或许也会很快从大地上消失吧。\n 正是由于这个单词，作者写下了这部著作。\n 一八三一年三月。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/264/2501.html","bookId":227,"book":{"id":227,"title":"巴黎圣母院 Notre-Dame de Paris","description":"简介： 丑聋人卡西莫多被巴黎圣母院的神父克洛德收养，做撞钟人，外貌正经的克洛德神父自从遇见美丽的吉普赛少女爱斯美拉达后，被其美色所诱而神魂颠倒，指使卡西莫多强行掳走爱斯美...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/110326/1-110326125SJ96.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/264","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM"}}
