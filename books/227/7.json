{"id":6975,"no":7,"title":"Book 1 Chapter 6 Esmeralda","content":"We are delighted to be able to inform the reader, that during the whole of this scene, Gringoire and his piece had stood firm. His actors, spurred on by him, had not ceased to spout his comedy, and he had not ceased to listen to it. He had made up his mind about the tumult, and was determined to proceed to the end, not giving up the hope of a return of attention on the part of the public. This gleam of hope acquired fresh life, when he saw Quasimodo, Coppenole, and the deafening escort of the pope of the procession of fools quit the hall amid great uproar. The throng rushed eagerly after them. \"Good,\" he said to himself, \"there go all the mischief- makers.\" Unfortunately, all the mischief-makers constituted the entire audience. In the twinkling of an eye, the grand hall was empty. To tell the truth, a few spectators still remained, some scattered, others in groups around the pillars, women, old men, or children, who had had enough of the uproar and tumult. Some scholars were still perched astride of the window-sills, engaged in gazing into the Place. \"Well,\" thought Gringoire, \"here are still as many as are required to hear the end of my mystery. They are few in number, but it is a choice audience, a lettered audience.\" An instant later, a symphony which had been intended to produce the greatest effect on the arrival of the Virgin, was lacking. Gringoire perceived that his music had been carried off by the procession of the Pope of the Fools. \"Skip it,\" said he, stoically. He approached a group of bourgeois, who seemed to him to be discussing his piece. This is the fragment of conversation which he caught,-- \"You know, Master Cheneteau, the H?tel de Navarre, which belonged to Monsieur de Nemours?\" \"Yes, opposite the Chapelle de Braque.\" \"Well, the treasury has just let it to Guillaume Alixandre, historian, for six hivres, eight sols, parisian, a year.\" \"How rents are going up!\" \"Come,\" said Gringoire to himself, with a sigh, \"the others are listening.\" \"Comrades,\" suddenly shouted one of the young scamps from the window, \"La Esmeralda! La Esmeralda in the Place!\" This word produced a magical effect. Every one who was left in the hall flew to the windows, climbing the walls in order to see, and repeating, \"La Esmeralda! La Esmeralda?\" At the same time, a great sound of applause was heard from without. \"What\u0027s the meaning of this, of the Esmeralda?\" said Gringoire, wringing his hands in despair. \"Ah, good heavens! it seems to be the turn of the windows now.\" He returned towards the marble table, and saw that the representation had been interrupted. It was precisely at the instant when Jupiter should have appeared with his thunder. But Jupiter was standing motionless at the foot of the stage. \"Michel Giborne!\" cried the irritated poet, \"what are you doing there? Is that your part? Come up!\" \"Alas!\" said Jupiter, \"a scholar has just seized the ladder.\" Gringoire looked. It was but too true. All communication between his plot and its solution was intercepted. \"The rascal,\" he murmured. \"And why did he take that ladder?\" \"In order to go and see the Esmeralda,\" replied Jupiter piteously. \"He said, \u0027Come, here\u0027s a ladder that\u0027s of no use!\u0027 and he took it.\" This was the last blow. Gringoire received it with resignation. \"May the devil fly away with you!\" he said to the comedian, \"and if I get my pay, you shall receive yours.\" Then he beat a retreat, with drooping head, but the last in the field, like a general who has fought well. And as he descended the winding stairs of the courts: \"A fine rabble of asses and dolts these Parisians!\" he muttered between his teeth; \"they come to hear a mystery and don\u0027t listen to it at all! They are engrossed by every one, by Chopin Trouillefou, by the cardinal, by Coppenole, by Quasimodo, by the devil! but by Madame the Virgin Mary, not at all. If I had known, I\u0027d have given you Virgin Mary; you ninnies! And I! to come to see faces and behold only backs! to be a poet, and to reap the success of an apothecary! It is true that Homerus begged through the Greek towns, and that Naso died in exile among the Muscovites. But may the devil flay me if I understand what they mean with their Esmeralda! What is that word, in the first place?--\u0027tis Egyptian!\" 我们很高兴能够告诉读者，在发生那桩事情的当儿，甘果瓦和他的戏一直好好撑持着。被他鼓舞起来的演员们没有停止演他的戏，而他自己也没有停止欣赏。不管人们怎样哄闹，他决心让戏一直演到终场，他对于挽回观众的注意还没有失望呢。当他看见伽西莫多、科勃诺尔以及跟随愚人王的人们闹嚷嚷地离开大厅时，这一线希望更加光明了。群众急急忙忙地跟着涌了出去。“好呀，”他说，“这些无赖滚蛋了！”但不幸全都是些无赖。大厅一眨眼就空空如也了。 说实在的，也还有些观众留在那里。他们有的东一个西一个，有的分成几堆围着那些柱子，都是些老人、妇女和儿童，闹嚷得够厉害的。有几个学生骑在窗口上朝广场望着。 “也好，”甘果瓦想道，“还有这么多我需要的观众想听听戏的结尾呢。 他们人数虽少，但却是高尚的人，有文学修养的人。” 过了一会，那本来应该在圣母出场时引起惊人效果的交响乐竟没有按时演奏，甘果瓦发现他的乐队被愚人王的行列带走了。 他觉得一群市民好象在谈论他的戏剧，就走了过去。下面就是他听到的谈话的片断：“秦多阁下，您知道德·纳姆先生的那瓦尔大楼吗？” “知道呀，就在布拉克小教堂对面。” “好，财政部刚刚把它租给了历史学家居约姆·亚历山大，租金每年六个巴黎里弗零八个索尔。” “房租涨得多厉害！” “得了吧，”甘果瓦叹息道，“总算其余的人还在听戏。” “同学们！”一个跨在窗口上的青年忽然喊道，“拉·爱斯梅拉达！拉·爱斯梅拉达到广场来哪！” 这词儿产生了魔术般的效果，大厅里剩下的人都跑到窗口，爬上墙头去看，并且一叠连声地喊道：“拉·爱斯梅拉达！拉·爱斯梅拉达！” 同时听得见外面有一阵响亮的欢呼声。 “拉·爱斯梅拉达这个词是什么意思？”甘果瓦失望地交叉着双手说。 “啊，我的天呀！似乎现在轮到那些窗户跟前的人也要跑啦！” 他转身回到大理石台子跟前，看见演出给打断了。那正是朱比特应该带着雷电出场的时候。可是朱比特呆呆地站在戏台下面。 “米歇尔·吉博伦！”激怒的诗人喊道，“你在那儿干什么？这是你要演的角色吗？快上台去！” “哎！”朱比特答道，“一个学生刚才把楼梯搬走了。” 甘果瓦看了看，情况是再真实不过了。戏台的上下场口被切断啦。 “无赖汉！”他喃喃地说道，“但是他把那梯子搬去干什么呢？” “拿去看拉·爱斯梅拉达呀。”朱比特可怜巴巴地回答。“他说了一声‘这里有一架没人用的梯子呢！’就把它搬走了。” 这是最后一个打击，甘果瓦听天由命地接受了。 “让魔鬼把你们抓去吧！”他向演员们说，“要是我得到钱，你们也能得到的啊。” 于是他低着头退出大厅，可是走在最后，就象一位吃了大败仗的将军。 走下司法官的那些七拐八弯的梯级时，他咬着牙抱怨说：“这些巴黎人都是一大群驴子和笨蛋！他们是来看圣迹剧的，却根本不着戏！他们忙着看所有的人，看克洛潘·图意弗，看红衣主教，看科勃诺尔，看伽西莫多，看魔鬼，却不看圣母玛丽亚！假若我早一点知道，我早就把圣母玛丽亚送给你们哪，你们这些东游西逛的家伙！我呢，我是来看人们的面孔的，却只看到些脊梁！我是诗人，却被当做卖狗皮膏药的了！真的，荷马曾经在希腊村镇讨过饭，纳松在莫斯科人中间流浪到死。可是假若我懂得人们说的拉·爱斯梅拉达是什么意思，我情愿让魔鬼来把我剥皮！首先，这到底是什么话呢？ 这是埃及话呀！”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/264/2507.html","bookId":227,"book":{"id":227,"title":"巴黎圣母院 Notre-Dame de Paris","description":"简介： 丑聋人卡西莫多被巴黎圣母院的神父克洛德收养，做撞钟人，外貌正经的克洛德神父自从遇见美丽的吉普赛少女爱斯美拉达后，被其美色所诱而神魂颠倒，指使卡西莫多强行掳走爱斯美...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/110326/1-110326125SJ96.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/264","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM"}}
