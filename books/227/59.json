{"id":7027,"no":59,"title":"Book 11 Chapter 3 The Marriage Of Phoebus","content":"Towards evening on that day, when the judiciary officers of the bishop came to pick up from the pavement of the Parvis the dislocated corpse of the archdeacon, Quasimodo had disappeared. A great many rumors were in circulation with regard to this adventure. No one doubted but that the day had come when, in accordance with their compact, Quasimodo, that is to say, the devil, was to carry off Claude Frollo, that is to say, the sorcerer. It was presumed that he had broken the body when taking the soul, like monkeys who break the shell to get at the nut. This is why the archdeacon was not interred in consecrated earth. Louis XI. died a year later, in the month of August, 1483. As for Pierre Gringoire, he succeeded in saving the goat, and he won success in tragedy. It appears that, after having tasted astrology, philosophy, architecture, hermetics,--all vanities, he returned to tragedy, vainest pursuit of all. This is what he called \"coming to a tragic end.\" This is what is to be read, on the subject of his dramatic triumphs, in 1483, in the accounts of the \"Ordinary:\" \"To Jehan Marchand and Pierre Gringoire, carpenter and composer, who have made and composed the mystery made at the Ch?telet of Paris, at the entry of Monsieur the Legate, and have ordered the personages, clothed and dressed the same, as in the said mystery was required; and likewise, for having made the scaffoldings thereto necessary; and for this deed,--one hundred livres.\" Phoebus de Chateaupers also came to a tragic end. He married. 那天傍晚，当主教的司法执事们到巴尔维广场来收拾副主教那摔坏的尸体的时候，伽西莫多从圣母院失踪了。 这件事引起了许多流言蜚语，人们不再怀疑那是预定的期限到了。根据他们事先的约定，伽西莫多——即那个魔鬼——要把克洛德·孚罗洛——即那个巫师——带走。人们猜想他一定把后者的尸体剥开取出了灵魂，好象猴子剥开核桃吃里面的果仁那样。 这就是副主教没有被安葬在圣地里的原因。 路易十一在第二年——一四八三年——八月死去了。 至于比埃尔·甘果瓦呢，他终于救出了那只小山羊，而且编了几出成功的悲剧。这之后他似乎又对星相学、哲学、建筑学和炼金术等都发生过兴趣，他从所有那些疯疯癫癫的学问里又回过来搞他的悲剧，那更是疯癫之尤了，这就是他所谓的“得到了一个悲剧的收场”。关于他在戏剧方面的成就，可以读读一四八三年的王室流水账：“付若望·马尔尚和比埃尔·甘果瓦，前者是木匠，后者是剧作家，他俩曾编排公使先生莅临时在巴黎沙特雷法庭上演之宗教剧，为置办该剧人物所需之衣服用具及建造所需看台等之费用，共一百里弗。” 弗比斯·德·沙多倍尔也得到了一个悲剧的收场：他结婚了。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/264/2559.html","bookId":227,"book":{"id":227,"title":"巴黎圣母院 Notre-Dame de Paris","description":"简介： 丑聋人卡西莫多被巴黎圣母院的神父克洛德收养，做撞钟人，外貌正经的克洛德神父自从遇见美丽的吉普赛少女爱斯美拉达后，被其美色所诱而神魂颠倒，指使卡西莫多强行掳走爱斯美...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/110326/1-110326125SJ96.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/264","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM"}}
