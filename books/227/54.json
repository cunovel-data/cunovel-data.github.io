{"id":7022,"no":54,"title":"Book 10 Chapter 5 The Retreat In Which Mosieur Louis Of Franc","content":"The reader has not, perhaps, forgotten that one moment before catching sight of the nocturnal band of vagabonds, Quasimodo, as he inspected Paris from the heights of his bell tower, perceived only one light burning, which gleamed like a star from a window on the topmost story of a lofty edifice beside the Porte Saint-Antoine. This edifice was the Bastille. That star was the candle of Louis XI. King Louis XI. had, in fact, been two days in Paris. He was to take his departure on the next day but one for his citadel of Montilz-les-Tours. He made but seldom and brief appearance in his good city of Paris, since there he did not feel about him enough pitfalls, gibbets, and Scotch archers. He had come, that day, to sleep at the Bastille. The great chamber five toises* square, which he had at the Louvre, with its huge chimney-piece loaded with twelve great beasts and thirteen great prophets, and his grand bed, eleven feet by twelve, pleased him but little. He felt himself lost amid all this grandeur. This good bourgeois king preferred the Bastille with a tiny chamber and couch. And then, the Bastille was stronger than the Louvre. * An ancient long measure in France, containing six feet and nearly five inches English measure. This little chamber, which the king reserved for himself in the famous state prison, was also tolerably spacious and occupied the topmost story of a turret rising from the donjon keep. It was circular in form, carpeted with mats of shining straw, ceiled with beams, enriched with fleurs-de-lis of gilded metal with interjoists in color; wainscoated with rich woods sown with rosettes of white metal, and with others painted a fine, bright green, made of orpiment and fine indigo. There was only one window, a long pointed casement, latticed with brass wire and bars of iron, further darkened by fine colored panes with the arms of the king and of the queen, each pane being worth two and twenty sols. There was but one entrance, a modern door, with a fiat arch, garnished with a piece of tapestry on the inside, and on the outside by one of those porches of Irish wood, frail edifices of cabinet-work curiously wrought, numbers of which were still to be seen in old houses a hundred and fifty years ago. \"Although they disfigure and embarrass the places,\" says Sauvel in despair, \"our old people are still unwilling to get rid of them, and keep them in spite of everybody.\" In this chamber, nothing was to be found of what furnishes ordinary apartments, neither benches, nor trestles, nor forms, nor common stools in the form of a chest, nor fine stools sustained by pillars and counter-pillars, at four sols a piece. Only one easy arm-chair, very magnificent, was to be seen; the wood was painted with roses on a red ground, the seat was of ruby Cordovan leather, ornamented with long silken fringes, and studded with a thousand golden nails. The loneliness of this chair made it apparent that only one person had a right to sit down in this apartment. Beside the chair, and quite close to the window, there was a table covered with a cloth with a pattern of birds. On this table stood an inkhorn spotted with ink, some parchments, several pens, and a large goblet of chased silver. A little further on was a brazier, a praying stool in crimson velvet, relieved with small bosses of gold. Finally, at the extreme end of the room, a simple bed of scarlet and yellow damask, without either tinsel or lace; having only an ordinary fringe. This bed, famous for having borne the sleep or the sleeplessness of Louis XI., was still to be seen two hundred years ago, at the house of a councillor of state, where it was seen by old Madame Pilou, celebrated in _Cyrus_ under the name \"Arricidie\" and of \"la Morale Vivante\". Such was the chamber which was called \"the retreat where Monsieur Louis de France says his prayers.\" At the moment when we have introduced the reader into it, this retreat was very dark. The curfew bell had sounded an hour before; night was come, and there was only one flickering wax candle set on the table to light five persons variously grouped in the chamber. The first on which the light fell was a seigneur superbly clad in breeches and jerkin of scarlet striped with silver, and a loose coat with half sleeves of cloth of gold with black figures. This splendid costume, on which the light played, seemed glazed with flame on every fold. The man who wore it had his armorial bearings embroidered on his breast in vivid colors; a chevron accompanied by a deer passant. The shield was flanked, on the right by an olive branch, on the left by a deer\u0027s antlers. This man wore in his girdle a rich dagger whose hilt, of silver gilt, was chased in the form of a helmet, and surmounted by a count\u0027s coronet. He had a forbidding air, a proud mien, and a head held high. At the first glance one read arrogance on his visage; at the second, craft. He was standing bareheaded, a long roll of parchment in his hand, behind the arm-chair in which was seated, his body ungracefully doubled up, his knees crossed, his elbow on the table, a very badly accoutred personage. Let the reader imagine in fact, on the rich seat of Cordova leather, two crooked knees, two thin thighs, poorly clad in black worsted tricot, a body enveloped in a cloak of fustian, with fur trimming of which more leather than hair was visible; lastly, to crown all, a greasy old hat of the worst sort of black cloth, bordered with a circular string of leaden figures. This, in company with a dirty skull-cap, which hardly allowed a hair to escape, was all that distinguished the seated personage. He held his head so bent upon his breast, that nothing was to be seen of his face thus thrown into shadow, except the tip of his nose, upon which fell a ray of light, and which must have been long. From the thinness of his wrinkled hand, one divined that he was an old man. It was Louis XI. At some distance behind them, two men dressed in garments of Flemish style were conversing, who were not sufficiently lost in the shadow to prevent any one who had been present at the performance of Gringoire\u0027s mystery from recognizing in them two of the principal Flemish envoys, Guillaume Rym, the sagacious pensioner of Ghent, and Jacques Coppenole, the popular hosier. The reader will remember that these men were mixed up in the secret politics of Louis XI. Finally, quite at the end of the room, near the door, in the dark, stood, motionless as a statue, a vigorous man with thickset limbs, a military harness, with a surcoat of armorial bearings, whose square face pierced with staring eyes, slit with an immense mouth, his ears concealed by two large screens of flat hair, had something about it both of the dog and the tiger. All were uncovered except the king. The gentleman who stood near the king was reading him a sort of long memorial to which his majesty seemed to be listening attentively. The two Flemings were whispering together. \"Cross of God!\" grumbled Coppenole, \"I am tired of standing; is there no chair here?\" Rym replied by a negative gesture, accompanied by a discreet smile. \"Croix-Dieu!\" resumed Coppenole, thoroughly unhappy at being obliged to lower his voice thus, \"I should like to sit down on the floor, with my legs crossed, like a hosier, as I do in my shop.\" \"Take good care that you do not, Master Jacques.\" \"Ouais! Master Guillaume! can one only remain here on his feet?\" \"Or on his knees,\" said Rym. At that moment the king\u0027s voice was uplifted. They held their peace. \"Fifty sols for the robes of our valets, and twelve livres for the mantles of the clerks of our crown! That\u0027s it! Pour out gold by the ton! Are you mad, Olivier?\" As he spoke thus, the old man raised his head. The golden shells of the collar of Saint-Michael could be seen gleaming on his neck. The candle fully illuminated his gaunt and morose profile. He tore the papers from the other\u0027s hand. \"You are ruining us!\" he cried, casting his hollow eyes over the scroll. \"What is all this? What need have we of so prodigious a household? Two chaplains at ten livres a month each, and, a chapel clerk at one hundred sols! A valet-de- chambre at ninety livres a year. Four head cooks at six score livres a year each! A spit-cook, an herb-cook, a sauce-cook, a butler, two sumpter-horse lackeys, at ten livres a month each! Two scullions at eight livres! A groom of the stables and his two aids at four and twenty livres a month! A porter, a pastry-cook, a baker, two carters, each sixty livres a year! And the farrier six score livres! And the master of the chamber of our funds, twelve hundred livres! And the comptroller five hundred. And how do I know what else? \u0027Tis ruinous. The wages of our servants are putting France to the pillage! All the ingots of the Louvre will melt before such a fire of expenses! We shall have to sell our plate! And next year, if God and our Lady (here he raised his hat) lend us life, we shall drink our potions from a pewter pot!\" So saying, he cast a glance at the silver goblet which gleamed upon the table. He coughed and continued,-- \"Master Olivier, the princes who reign over great lordships, like kings and emperors, should not allow sumptuousness in their houses; for the fire spreads thence through the province. Hence, Master Olivier, consider this said once for all. Our expenditure increases every year. The thing displease us. How, ~pasque-Dieu~! when in \u002779 it did not exceed six and thirty thousand livres, did it attain in \u002780, forty-three thousand six hundred and nineteen livres? I have the figures in my head. In \u002781, sixty-six thousand six hundred and eighty livres, and this year, by the faith of my body, it will reach eighty thousand livres! Doubled in four years! Monstrous!\" He paused breathless, then resumed energetically,-- \"I behold around me only people who fatten on my leanness! you suck crowns from me at every pore.\" All remained silent. This was one of those fits of wrath which are allowed to take their course. He continued,-- \"\u0027Tis like that request in Latin from the gentlemen of France, that we should re-establish what they call the grand charges of the Crown! Charges in very deed! Charges which crush! Ah! gentlemen! you say that we are not a king to reign ~dapifero nullo, buticulario nullo~! We will let you see, ~pasque-Dieu~! whether we are not a king!\" Here he smiled, in the consciousness of his power; this softened his bad humor, and he turned towards the Flemings,-- \"Do you see, Gossip Guillaume? the grand warden of the keys, the grand butler, the grand chamberlain, the grand seneschal are not worth the smallest valet. Remember this, Gossip Coppenole. They serve no purpose, as they stand thus useless round the king; they produce upon me the effect of the four Evangelists who surround the face of the big clock of the palace, and which Philippe Brille has just set in order afresh. They are gilt, but they do not indicate the hour; and the hands can get on without them.\" He remained in thought for a moment, then added, shaking his aged head,-- \"Ho! ho! by our Lady, I am not Philippe Brille, and I shall not gild the great vassals anew. Continue, Olivier.\" The person whom he designated by this name, took the papers into his hands again, and began to read aloud,-- \"To Adam Tenon, clerk of the warden of the seals of the provostship of Paris; for the silver, making, and engraving of said seals, which have been made new because the others preceding, by reason of their antiquity and their worn condition, could no longer be successfully used, twelve livres parisis. \"To Guillaume Frère, the sum of four livres, four sols parisis, for his trouble and salary, for having nourished and fed the doves in the two dove-cots of the H?tel des Tournelles, during the months of January, February, and March of this year; and for this he hath given seven sextiers of barley. \"To a gray friar for confessing a criminal, four sols parisis.\" The king listened in silence. From time to time be coughed; then he raised the goblet to his lips and drank a draught with a grimace. \"During this year there have been made by the ordinance of justice, to the sound of the trumpet, through the squares of Paris, fifty-six proclamations. Account to be regulated. \"For having searched and ransacked in certain places, in Paris as well as elsewhere, for money said to be there concealed; but nothing hath been found: forty-five livres parisis.\" \"Bury a crown to unearth a sou!\" said the king. \"For having set in the H?tel des Tournelles six panes of white glass in the place where the iron cage is, thirteen sols; for having made and delivered by command of the king, on the day of the musters, four shields with the escutcheons of the said seigneur, encircled with garlands of roses all about, six livres; for two new sleeves to the king\u0027s old doublet, twenty sols; for a box of grease to grease the boots of the king, fifteen deniers; a stable newly made to lodge the king\u0027s black pigs, thirty livres parisis; many partitions, planks, and trap-doors, for the safekeeping of the lions at Saint-Paul, twenty-two livres.\" \"These be dear beasts,\" said Louis XI. \"It matters not; it is a fine magnificence in a king. There is a great red lion whom I love for his pleasant ways. Have you seen him, Master Guillaume? Princes must have these terrific animals; for we kings must have lions for our dogs and tigers for our cats. The great befits a crown. In the days of the pagans of Jupiter, when the people offered the temples a hundred oxen and a hundred sheep, the emperors gave a hundred lions and a hundred eagles. This was wild and very fine. The kings of France have always had roarings round their throne. Nevertheless, people must do me this justice, that I spend still less money on it than they did, and that I possess a greater modesty of lions, bears, elephants, and leopards.--Go on, Master Olivier. We wished to say thus much to our Flemish friends.\" Guillaume Rym bowed low, while Coppenole, with his surly mien, had the air of one of the bears of which his majesty was speaking. The king paid no heed. He had just dipped his lips into the goblet, and he spat out the beverage, saying: \"Foh! what a disagreeable potion!\" The man who was reading continued:-- \"For feeding a rascally footpad, locked up these six months in the little cell of the flayer, until it should be determined what to do with him, six livres, four sols.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" interrupted the king; \"feed what ought to be hanged! ~Pasque-Dieu~! I will give not a sou more for that nourishment. Olivier, come to an understanding about the matter with Monsieur d\u0027Estouteville, and prepare me this very evening the wedding of the gallant and the gallows. Resume.\" Olivier made a mark with his thumb against the article of the \"rascally foot soldier,\" and passed on. \"To Henriet Cousin, master executor of the high works of justice in Paris, the sum of sixty sols parisis, to him assessed and ordained by monseigneur the provost of Paris, for having bought, by order of the said sieur the provost, a great broad sword, serving to execute and decapitate persons who are by justice condemned for their demerits, and he hath caused the same to be garnished with a sheath and with all things thereto appertaining; and hath likewise caused to be repointed and set in order the old sword, which had become broken and notched in executing justice on Messire Louis de Luxembourg, as will more fully appear . The king interrupted: \"That suffices. I allow the sum with great good will. Those are expenses which I do not begrudge. I have never regretted that money. Continue.\" \"For having made over a great cage...\" \"Ah!\" said the king, grasping the arms of his chair in both hands, \"I knew well that I came hither to this Bastille for some purpose. Hold, Master Olivier; I desire to see that cage myself. You shall read me the cost while I am examining it. Messieurs Flemings, come and see this; \u0027tis curious.\" Then he rose, leaned on the arm of his interlocutor, made a sign to the sort of mute who stood before the door to precede him, to the two Flemings to follow him, and quitted the room. The royal company was recruited, at the door of the retreat, by men of arms, all loaded down with iron, and by slender pages bearing flambeaux. It marched for some time through the interior of the gloomy donjon, pierced with staircases and corridors even in the very thickness of the walls. The captain of the Bastille marched at their head, and caused the wickets to be opened before the bent and aged king, who coughed as he walked. At each wicket, all heads were obliged to stoop, except that of the old man bent double with age. \"Hum,\" said he between his gums, for he had no longer any teeth, \"we are already quite prepared for the door of the sepulchre. For a low door, a bent passer.\" At length, after having passed a final wicket, so loaded with locks that a quarter of an hour was required to open it, they entered a vast and lofty vaulted hall, in the centre of which they could distinguish by the light of the torches, a huge cubic mass of masonry, iron, and wood. The interior was hollow. It was one of those famous cages of prisoners of state, which were called \"the little daughters of the king.\" In its walls there were two or three little windows so closely trellised with stout iron bars; that the glass was not visible. The door was a large flat slab of stone, as on tombs; the sort of door which serves for entrance only. Only here, the occupant was alive. The king began to walk slowly round the little edifice, examining it carefully, while Master Olivier, who followed him, read aloud the note. \"For having made a great cage of wood of solid beams, timbers and wall-plates, measuring nine feet in length by eight in breadth, and of the height of seven feet between the partitions, smoothed and clamped with great bolts of iron, which has been placed in a chamber situated in one of the towers of the Bastille Saint-Antoine, in which cage is placed and detained, by command of the king our lord, a prisoner who formerly inhabited an old, decrepit, and ruined cage. There have been employed in making the said new cage, ninety-six horizontal beams, and fifty-two upright joists, ten wall plates three toises long; there have been occupied nineteen carpenters to hew, work, and fit all the said wood in the courtyard of the Bastille during twenty days.\" \"Very fine heart of oak,\" said the king, striking the woodwork with his fist. \"There have been used in this cage,\" continued the other, \"two hundred and twenty great bolts of iron, of nine feet, and of eight, the rest of medium length, with the rowels, caps and counterbands appertaining to the said bolts; weighing, the said iron in all, three thousand, seven hundred and thirty-five pounds; beside eight great squares of iron, serving to attach the said cage in place with clamps and nails weighing in all two hundred and eighteen pounds, not reckoning the iron of the trellises for the windows of the chamber wherein the cage hath been placed, the bars of iron for the door of the cage and other things.\" \"\u0027Tis a great deal of iron,\" said the king, \"to contain the light of a spirit.\" \"The whole amounts to three hundred and seventeen livres, five sols, seven deniers.\" \"~Pasque-Dieu~!\" exclaimed the king. At this oath, which was the favorite of Louis XI., some one seemed to awaken in the interior of the cage; the sound of chains was heard, grating on the floor, and a feeble voice, which seemed to issue from the tomb was uplifted. \"Sire! sire! mercy!\" The one who spoke thus could not be seen. \"Three hundred and seventeen livres, five sols, seven deniers,\" repeated Louis XI. The lamentable voice which had proceeded from the cage had frozen all present, even Master Olivier himself. The king alone wore the air of not having heard. At his order, Master Olivier resumed his reading, and his majesty coldly continued his inspection of the cage. \"In addition to this there hath been paid to a mason who hath made the holes wherein to place the gratings of the windows, and the floor of the chamber where the cage is, because that floor could not support this cage by reason of its weight, twenty-seven livres fourteen sols parisis.\" The voice began to moan again. \"Mercy, sire! I swear to you that \u0027twas Monsieur the Cardinal d\u0027Angers and not I, who was guilty of treason.\" \"The mason is bold!\" said the king. \"Continue, Olivier.\" Olivier continued,-- \"To a joiner for window frames, bedstead, hollow stool, and other things, twenty livres, two sols parisis.\" The voice also continued. \"Alas, sire! will you not listen to me? I protest to you that \u0027twas not I who wrote the matter to Monseigneur do Guyenne, but Monsieur le Cardinal Balue.\" \"The joiner is dear,\" quoth the king. \"Is that all?\" \"No, sire. To a glazier, for the windows of the said chamber, forty-six sols, eight deniers parisis.\" \"Have mercy, sire! Is it not enough to have given all my goods to my judges, my plate to Monsieur de Torcy, my library to Master Pierre Doriolle, my tapestry to the governor of the Roussillon? I am innocent. I have been shivering in an iron cage for fourteen years. Have mercy, sire! You will find your reward in heaven.\" \"Master Olivier,\" said the king, \"the total?\" \"Three hundred sixty-seven livres, eight sols, three deniers parisis. \"Notre-Dame!\" cried the king. \"This is an outrageous cage!\" He tore the book from Master Olivier\u0027s hands, and set to reckoning it himself upon his fingers, examining the paper and the cage alternately. Meanwhile, the prisoner could be heard sobbing. This was lugubrious in the darkness, and their faces turned pale as they looked at each other. \"Fourteen years, sire! Fourteen years now! since the month of April, 1469. In the name of the Holy Mother of God, sire, listen to me! During all this time you have enjoyed the heat of the sun. Shall I, frail creature, never more behold the day? Mercy, sire! Be pitiful! Clemency is a fine, royal virtue, which turns aside the currents of wrath. Does your majesty believe that in the hour of death it will be a great cause of content for a king never to have left any offence unpunished? Besides, sire, I did not betray your majesty, \u0027twas Monsieur d\u0027Angers; and I have on my foot a very heavy chain, and a great ball of iron at the end, much heavier than it should be in reason. Eh! sire! Have pity on me!\" \"Olivier,\" cried the king, throwing back his head, \"I observe that they charge me twenty sols a hogshead for plaster, while it is worth but twelve. You will refer back this account.\" He turned his back on the cage, and set out to leave the room. The miserable prisoner divined from the removal of the torches and the noise, that the king was taking his departure. \"Sire! sire!\" be cried in despair. The door closed again. He no longer saw anything, and heard only the hoarse voice of the turnkey, singing in his ears this ditty,-- \"~Ma?tre Jean Balue, A perdu la vue De ses évêchés. Monsieur de Verdun. N\u0027en a plus pas un; Tous sont dépêchés~.\"* * Master Jean Balue has lost sight of his bishoprics. Monsieur of Verdun has no longer one; all have been killed off. The king reascended in silence to his retreat, and his suite followed him, terrified by the last groans of the condemned man. All at once his majesty turned to the Governor of the Bastille,-- \"By the way,\" said he, \"was there not some one in that cage?\" \"Pardieu, yes sire!\" replied the governor, astounded by the question. \"And who was it?\" \"Monsieur the Bishop of Verdun.\" The king knew this better than any one else. But it was a mania of his. \"Ah!\" said he, with the innocent air of thinking of it for the first time, \"Guillaume de Harancourt, the friend of Monsieur the Cardinal Balue. A good devil of a bishop!\" At the expiration of a few moments, the door of the retreat had opened again, then closed upon the five personages whom the reader has seen at the beginning of this chapter, and who resumed their places, their whispered conversations, and their attitudes. During the king\u0027s absence, several despatches had been placed on his table, and he broke the seals himself. Then he began to read them promptly, one after the other, made a sign to Master Olivier who appeared to exercise the office of minister, to take a pen, and without communicating to him the contents of the despatches, he began to dictate in a low voice, the replies which the latter wrote, on his knees, in an inconvenient attitude before the table. Guillaume Rym was on the watch. The king spoke so low that the Flemings heard nothing of his dictation, except some isolated and rather unintelligible scraps, such as,-- \"To maintain the fertile places by commerce, and the sterile by manufactures....--To show the English lords our four bombards, London, Brabant, Bourg-en-Bresse, Saint- Omer....--Artillery is the cause of war being made more judiciously now....--To Monsieur de Bressuire, our friend....--Armies cannot be maintained without tribute, etc. Once he raised his voice,-- \"~Pasque Dieu~! Monsieur the King of Sicily seals his letters with yellow wax, like a king of France. Perhaps we are in the wrong to permit him so to do. My fair cousin of Burgundy granted no armorial bearings with a field of gules. The grandeur of houses is assured by the integrity of prerogatives. Note this, friend Olivier.\" Again,-- \"Oh! oh!\" said he, \"What a long message! What doth our brother the emperor claim?\" And running his eye over the missive and breaking his reading with interjection: \"Surely! the Germans are so great and powerful, that it is hardly credible--But let us not forget the old proverb: \u0027The finest county is Flanders; the finest duchy, Milan; the finest kingdom, France.\u0027 Is it not so, Messieurs Flemings?\" This time Coppenole bowed in company with Guillaume Rym. The hosier\u0027s patriotism was tickled. The last despatch made Louis XI. frown. \"What is this?\" be said, \"Complaints and fault finding against our garrisons in Picardy! Olivier, write with diligence to M. the Marshal de Rouault:--That discipline is relaxed. That the gendarmes of the unattached troops, the feudal nobles, the free archers, and the Swiss inflict infinite evils on the rustics.--That the military, not content with what they find in the houses of the rustics, constrain them with violent blows of cudgel or of lash to go and get wine, spices, and other unreasonable things in the town.--That monsieur the king knows this. That we undertake to guard our people against inconveniences, larcenies and pillage.--That such is our will, by our Lady!--That in addition, it suits us not that any fiddler, barber, or any soldier varlet should be clad like a prince, in velvet, cloth of silk, and rings of gold.--That these vanities are hateful to God.--That we, who are gentlemen, content ourselves with a doublet of cloth at sixteen sols the ell, of Paris.--That messieurs the camp-followers can very well come down to that, also.--Command and ordain.--To Monsieur de Rouault, our friend.--Good.\" He dictated this letter aloud, in a firm tone, and in jerks. At the moment when he finished it, the door opened and gave passage to a new personage, who precipitated himself into the chamber, crying in affright,-- \"Sire! sire! there is a sedition of the populace in Paris!\" Louis XI.\u0027s grave face contracted; but all that was visible of his emotion passed away like a flash of lightning. He controlled himself and said with tranquil severity,-- \"Gossip Jacques, you enter very abruptly!\" \"Sire! sire! there is a revolt!\" repeated Gossip Jacques breathlessly. The king, who had risen, grasped him roughly by the arm, and said in his ear, in such a manner as to be heard by him alone, with concentrated rage and a sidelong glance at the Flemings,-- \"Hold your tongue! or speak low!\" The new comer understood, and began in a low tone to give a very terrified account, to which the king listened calmly, while Guillaume Rym called Coppenole\u0027s attention to the face and dress of the new arrival, to his furred cowl, (~caputia fourrata~), his short cape, (~epitogia curta~), his robe of black velvet, which bespoke a president of the court of accounts. Hardly had this personage given the king some explanations, when Louis XI. exclaimed, bursting into a laugh,-- \"In truth? Speak aloud, Gossip Coictier! What call is there for you to talk so low? Our Lady knoweth that we conceal nothing from our good friends the Flemings.\" \"But sire...\" \"Speak loud!\" Gossip Coictier was struck dumb with surprise. \"So,\" resumed the king,--\"speak sir,--there is a commotion among the louts in our good city of Paris?\" \"Yes, sire.\" \"And which is moving you say, against monsieur the bailiff of the Palais-de-Justice?\" \"So it appears,\" said the gossip, who still stammered, utterly astounded by the abrupt and inexplicable change which had just taken place in the king\u0027s thoughts. Louis XI. continued: \"Where did the watch meet the rabble?\" \"Marching from the Grand Truanderie, towards the Pont-aux- Changeurs. I met it myself as I was on my way hither to obey your majesty\u0027s commands. I heard some of them shouting: \u0027Down with the bailiff of the palace!\u0027\" \"And what complaints have they against the bailiff?\" \"Ah!\" said Gossip Jacques, \"because he is their lord.\" \"Really?\" \"Yes, sire. They are knaves from the Cour-des-Miracles. They have been complaining this long while, of the bailiff, whose vassals they are. They do not wish to recognize him either as judge or as voyer?\"* * One in charge of the highways. \"Yes, certainly!\" retorted the king with a smile of satis- faction which he strove in vain to disguise. \"In all their petitions to the Parliament, they claim to have but two masters. Your majesty and their God, who is the devil, I believe.\" \"Eh! eh!\" said the king. He rubbed his hands, he laughed with that inward mirth which makes the countenance beam; he was unable to dissimulate his joy, although he endeavored at moments to compose himself. No one understood it in the least, not even Master Olivier. He remained silent for a moment, with a thoughtful but contented air. \"Are they in force?\" he suddenly inquired. \"Yes, assuredly, sire,\" replied Gossip Jacques. \"How many?\" \"Six thousand at the least.\" The king could not refrain from saying: \"Good!\" he went on,-- \"Are they armed?\" \"With scythes, pikes, hackbuts, pickaxes. All sorts of very violent weapons.\" The king did not appear in the least disturbed by this list. Jacques considered it his duty to add,-- \"If your majesty does not send prompt succor to the bailiff, he is lost.\" \"We will send,\" said the king with an air of false seriousness. \"It is well. Assuredly we will send. Monsieur the bailiff is our friend. Six thousand! They are desperate scamps! Their audacity is marvellous, and we are greatly enraged at it. But we have only a few people about us to-night. To-morrow morning will be time enough.\" Gossip Jacques exclaimed, \"Instantly, sire! there will be time to sack the bailiwick a score of times, to violate the seignory, to hang the bailiff. For God\u0027s sake, sire! send before to-morrow morning.\" The king looked him full in the face. \"I have told you to-morrow morning.\" It was one Of those looks to which one does not reply. After a silence, Louis XI. raised his voice once more,-- \"You should know that, Gossip Jacques. What was--\" He corrected himself. \"What is the bailiff\u0027s feudal jurisdiction?\" \"Sire, the bailiff of the palace has the Rue Calendre as far as the Rue de l\u0027Herberie, the Place Saint-Michel, and the localities vulgarly known as the Mureaux, situated near the church of Notre-Dame des Champs (here Louis XI. raised the brim of his hat), which hotels number thirteen, plus the Cour des Miracles, plus the Maladerie, called the Banlieue, plus the whole highway which begins at that Maladerie and ends at the Porte Sainte-Jacques. Of these divers places he is voyer, high, middle, and low, justiciary, full seigneur.\" \"Bless me!\" said the king, scratching his left ear with his right hand, \"that makes a goodly bit of my city! Ah! monsieur the bailiff was king of all that.\" This time he did not correct himself. He continued dreamily, and as though speaking to himself,-- \"Very fine, monsieur the bailiff! You had there between your teeth a pretty slice of our Paris.\" All at once he broke out explosively, \"~Pasque-Dieu~!\" What people are those who claim to be voyers, justiciaries, lords and masters in our domains? who have their tollgates at the end of every field? their gallows and their hangman at every cross-road among our people? So that as the Greek believed that he had as many gods as there were fountains, and the Persian as many as he beheld stars, the Frenchman counts as many kings as he sees gibbets! Pardieu! \u0027tis an evil thing, and the confusion of it displeases me. I should greatly like to know whether it be the mercy of God that there should be in Paris any other lord than the king, any other judge than our parliament, any other emperor than ourselves in this empire! By the faith of my soul! the day must certainly come when there shall exist in France but one king, one lord, one judge, one headsman, as there is in paradise but one God!\" He lifted his cap again, and continued, still dreamily, with the air and accent of a hunter who is cheering on his pack of hounds: \"Good, my people! bravely done! break these false lords! do your duty! at them! have at them! pillage them! take them! sack them!....Ah! you want to be kings, messeigneurs? On, my people on!\" Here he interrupted himself abruptly, bit his lips as though to take back his thought which had already half escaped, bent his piercing eyes in turn on each of the five persons who surrounded him, and suddenly grasping his hat with both hands and staring full at it, he said to it: \"Oh! I would burn you if you knew what there was in my head.\" Then casting about him once more the cautious and uneasy glance of the fox re-entering his hole,-- \"No matter! we will succor monsieur the bailiff. Unfortunately, we have but few troops here at the present moment, against so great a populace. We must wait until to-morrow. The order will be transmitted to the City and every one who is caught will be immediately hung.\" \"By the way, sire,\" said Gossip Coictier, \"I had forgotten that in the first agitation, the watch have seized two laggards of the band. If your majesty desires to see these men, they are here.\" \"If I desire to see them!\" cried the king. \"What! ~Pasque- Dieu~! You forget a thing like that! Run quick, you, Olivier! Go, seek them!\" Master Olivier quitted the room and returned a moment later with the two prisoners, surrounded by archers of the guard. The first had a coarse, idiotic, drunken and astonished face. He was clothed in rags, and walked with one knee bent and dragging his leg. The second had a pallid and smiling countenance, with which the reader is already acquainted. The king surveyed them for a moment without uttering a word, then addressing the first one abruptly,-- \"What\u0027s your name?\" \"Gieffroy Pincebourde.\" \"Your trade.\" \"Outcast.\" \"What were you going to do in this damnable sedition?\" The outcast stared at the king, and swung his arms with a stupid air. He had one of those awkwardly shaped heads where intelligence is about as much at its ease as a light beneath an extinguisher. \"I know not,\" said he. \"They went, I went.\" \"Were you not going to outrageously attack and pillage your lord, the bailiff of the palace?\" \"I know that they were going to take something from some one. That is all.\" A soldier pointed out to the king a billhook which he had seized on the person of the vagabond. \"Do you recognize this weapon?\" demanded the king. \"Yes; \u0027tis my billhook; I am a vine-dresser.\" \"And do you recognize this man as your companion?\" added Louis XI., pointing to the other prisoner. \"No, I do not know him.\" \"That will do,\" said the king, making a sign with his finger to the silent personage who stood motionless beside the door, to whom we have already called the reader\u0027s attention. \"Gossip Tristan, here is a man for you.\" Tristan l\u0027Hermite bowed. He gave an order in a low voice to two archers, who led away the poor vagabond. In the meantime, the king had approached the second prisoner, who was perspiring in great drops: \"Your name?\" \"Sire, Pierre Gringoire.\" \"Your trade?\" \"Philosopher, sire.\" \"How do you permit yourself, knave, to go and besiege our friend, monsieur the bailiff of the palace, and what have you to say concerning this popular agitation?\" \"Sire, I had nothing to do with it.\" \"Come, now! you wanton wretch, were not you apprehended by the watch in that bad company?\" \"No, sire, there is a mistake. \u0027Tis a fatality. I make tragedies. Sire, I entreat your majesty to listen to me. I am a poet. \u0027Tis the melancholy way of men of my profession to roam the streets by night. I was passing there. It was mere chance. I was unjustly arrested; I am innocent of this civil tempest. Your majesty sees that the vagabond did not recognize me. I conjure your majesty--\" \"Hold your tongue!\" said the king, between two swallows of his ptisan. \"You split our head!\" Tristan l\u0027Hermite advanced and pointing to Gringoire,-- \"Sire, can this one be hanged also?\" This was the first word that he had uttered. \"Phew!\" replied the king, \"I see no objection.\" \"I see a great many!\" said Gringoire. At that moment, our philosopher was greener than an olive. He perceived from the king\u0027s cold and indifferent mien that there was no other resource than something very pathetic, and he flung himself at the feet of Louis XI., exclaiming, with gestures of despair:-- \"Sire! will your majesty deign to hear me. Sire! break not in thunder over so small a thing as myself. God\u0027s great lightning doth not bombard a lettuce. Sire, you are an august and, very puissant monarch; have pity on a poor man who is honest, and who would find it more difficult to stir up a revolt than a cake of ice would to give out a spark! Very gracious sire, kindness is the virtue of a lion and a king. Alas! rigor only frightens minds; the impetuous gusts of the north wind do not make the traveller lay aside his cloak; the sun, bestowing his rays little by little, warms him in such ways that it will make him strip to his shirt. Sire, you are the sun. I protest to you, my sovereign lord and master, that I am not an outcast, thief, and disorderly fellow. Revolt and brigandage belong not to the outfit of Apollo. I am not the man to fling myself into those clouds which break out into seditious clamor. I am your majesty\u0027s faithful vassal. That same jealousy which a husband cherisheth for the honor of his wife, the resentment which the son hath for the love of his father, a good vassal should feel for the glory of his king; he should pine away for the zeal of this house, for the aggrandizement of his service. Every other passion which should transport him would be but madness. These, sire, are my maxims of state: then do not judge me to be a seditious and thieving rascal because my garment is worn at the elbows. If you will grant me mercy, sire, I will wear it out on the knees in praying to God for you night and morning! Alas! I am not extremely rich, \u0027tis true. I am even rather poor. But not vicious on that account. It is not my fault. Every one knoweth that great wealth is not to be drawn from literature, and that those who are best posted in good books do not always have a great fire in winter. The advocate\u0027s trade taketh all the grain, and leaveth only straw to the other scientific professions. There are forty very excellent proverbs anent the hole-ridden cloak of the philosopher. Oh, sire! clemency is the only light which can enlighten the interior of so great a soul. Clemency beareth the torch before all the other virtues. Without it they are but blind men groping after God in the dark. Compassion, which is the same thing as clemency, causeth the love of subjects, which is the most powerful bodyguard to a prince. What matters it to your majesty, who dazzles all faces, if there is one poor man more on earth, a poor innocent philosopher spluttering amid the shadows of calamity, with an empty pocket which resounds against his hollow belly? Moreover, sire, I am a man of letters. Great kings make a pearl for their crowns by protecting letters. Hercules did not disdain the title of Musagetes. Mathias Corvin favored Jean de Monroyal, the ornament of mathematics. Now, \u0027tis an ill way to protect letters to hang men of letters. What a stain on Alexander if he had hung Aristoteles! This act would not be a little patch on the face of his reputation to embellish it, but a very malignant ulcer to disfigure it. Sire! I made a very proper epithalamium for Mademoiselle of Flanders and Monseigneur the very august Dauphin. That is not a firebrand of rebellion. Your majesty sees that I am not a scribbler of no reputation, that I have studied excellently well, and that I possess much natural eloquence. Have mercy upon me, sire! In so doing you will perform a gallant deed to our Lady, and I swear to you that I am greatly terrified at the idea of being hanged!\" So saying, the unhappy Gringoire kissed the king\u0027s slippers, and Guillaume Rym said to Coppenole in a low tone: \"He doth well to drag himself on the earth. Kings are like the Jupiter of Crete, they have ears only in their feet.\" And without troubling himself about the Jupiter of Crete, the hosier replied with a heavy smile, and his eyes fixed on Gringoire: \"Oh! that\u0027s it exactly! I seem to hear Chancellor Hugonet craving mercy of me.\" When Gringoire paused at last, quite out of breath, he raised his head tremblingly towards the king, who was engaged in scratching a spot on the knee of his breeches with his finger- nail; then his majesty began to drink from the goblet of ptisan. But he uttered not a word, and this silence tortured Gringoire. At last the king looked at him. \"Here is a terrible bawler!\" said, he. Then, turning to Tristan l\u0027Hermite, \"Bali! let him go!\" Gringoire fell backwards, quite thunderstruck with joy. \"At liberty!\" growled Tristan \"Doth not your majesty wish to have him detained a little while in a cage?\" \"Gossip,\" retorted Louis XI., \"think you that \u0027tis for birds of this feather that we cause to be made cages at three hundred and sixty-seven livres, eight sous, three deniers apiece? Release him at once, the wanton (Louis XI. was fond of this word which formed, with ~Pasque-Dieu~, the foundation of his joviality), and put him out with a buffet.\" \"Ugh!\" cried Gringoire, \"what a great king is here!\" And for fear of a counter order, he rushed towards the door, which Tristan opened for him with a very bad grace. The soldiers left the room with him, pushing him before them with stout thwacks, which Gringoire bore like a true stoical philosopher. The king\u0027s good humor since the revolt against the bailiff had been announced to him, made itself apparent in every way. This unwonted clemency was no small sign of it. Tristan l\u0027Hermite in his corner wore the surly look of a dog who has had a bone snatched away from him. Meanwhile, the king thrummed gayly with his fingers on the arm of his chair, the March of Pont-Audemer. He was a dissembling prince, but one who understood far better how to hide his troubles than his joys. These external manifestations of joy at any good news sometimes proceeded to very great lengths thus, on the death, of Charles the Bold, to the point of vowing silver balustrades to Saint Martin of Tours; on his advent to the throne, so far as forgetting to order his father\u0027s obsequies. \"Hé! sire!\" suddenly exclaimed Jacques Coictier, \"what has become of the acute attack of illness for which your majesty had me summoned?\" \"Oh!\" said the king, \"I really suffer greatly, my gossip. There is a hissing in my ear and fiery rakes rack my chest.\" Coictier took the king\u0027s hand, and begun to feel of his pulse with a knowing air. \"Look, Coppenole,\" said Rym, in a low voice. \"Behold him between Coictier and Tristan. They are his whole court. A physician for himself, a headsman for others.\" As he felt the king\u0027s pulse, Coictier assumed an air of greater and greater alarm. Louis XI. watched him with some anxiety. Coictier grew visibly more gloomy. The brave man had no other farm than the king\u0027s bad health. He speculated on it to the best of his ability. \"Oh! oh!\" he murmured at length, \"this is serious indeed.\" \"Is it not?\" said the king, uneasily. \"~Pulsus creber, anhelans, crepitans, irregularis~,\" continued the leech. \"~Pasque-Dieu~!\" \"This may carry off its man in less than three days.\" \"Our Lady!\" exclaimed the king. \"And the remedy, gossip?\" \"I am meditating upon that, sire.\" He made Louis XI. put out his tongue, shook his head, made a grimace, and in the very midst of these affectations,-- \"Pardieu, sire,\" he suddenly said, \"I must tell you that there is a receivership of the royal prerogatives vacant, and that I have a nephew.\" \"I give the receivership to your nephew, Gossip Jacques,\" replied the king; \"but draw this fire from my breast.\" \"Since your majesty is so clement,\" replied the leech, \"you will not refuse to aid me a little in building my house, Rue Saint-André-des-Arcs.\" \"Heugh!\" said the king. \"I am at the end of my finances,\" pursued the doctor; and it would really be a pity that the house should not have a roof; not on account of the house, which is simple and thoroughly bourgeois, but because of the paintings of Jehan Fourbault, which adorn its wainscoating. There is a Diana flying in the air, but so excellent, so tender, so delicate, of so ingenuous an action, her hair so well coiffed and adorned with a crescent, her flesh so white, that she leads into temptation those who regard her too curiously. There is also a Ceres. She is another very fair divinity. She is seated on sheaves of wheat and crowned with a gallant garland of wheat ears interlaced with salsify and other flowers. Never were seen more amorous eyes, more rounded limbs, a nobler air, or a more gracefully flowing skirt. She is one of the most innocent and most perfect beauties whom the brush has ever produced.\" \"Executioner!\" grumbled Louis XI., \"what are you driving at?\" \"I must have a roof for these paintings, sire, and, although \u0027tis but a small matter, I have no more money.\" \"How much doth your roof cost?\" \"Why a roof of copper, embellished and gilt, two thousand livres at the most.\" \"Ah, assassin!\" cried the king, \"He never draws out one of my teeth which is not a diamond.\" \"Am I to have my roof?\" said Coictier. \"Yes; and go to the devil, but cure me.\" Jacques Coictier bowed low and said,-- \"Sire, it is a repellent which will save you. We will apply to your loins the great defensive composed of cerate, Armenian bole, white of egg, oil, and vinegar. You will continue your ptisan and we will answer for your majesty.\" A burning candle does not attract one gnat alone. Master Olivier, perceiving the king to be in a liberal mood, and judging the moment to be propitious, approached in his turn. \"Sire--\" \"What is it now?\" said Louis XI. \"Sire, your majesty knoweth that Simon Radin is dead?\" \"Well?\" \"He was councillor to the king in the matter of the courts of the treasury.\" \"Well?\" \"Sire, his place is vacant.\" As he spoke thus, Master Olivier\u0027s haughty face quitted its arrogant expression for a lowly one. It is the only change which ever takes place in a courtier\u0027s visage. The king looked him well in the face and said in a dry tone,--\"I understand.\" He resumed, \"Master Olivier, the Marshal de Boucicaut was wont to say, \u0027There\u0027s no master save the king, there are no fishes save in the sea.\u0027 I see that you agree with Monsieur de Boucicaut. Now listen to this; we have a good memory. In \u002768 we made you valet of our chamber: in \u002769, guardian of the fortress of the bridge of Saint-Cloud, at a hundred livres of Tournay in wages (you wanted them of Paris). In November, \u002773, by letters given to Gergeole, we instituted you keeper of the Wood of Vincennes, in the place of Gilbert Acle, equerry; in \u002775, gruyer* of the forest of Rouvray-lez- Saint-Cloud, in the place of Jacques le Maire; in \u002778, we graciously settled on you, by letters patent sealed doubly with green wax, an income of ten livres parisis, for you and your wife, on the Place of the Merchants, situated at the School Saint-Germain; in \u002779, we made you gruyer of the forest of Senart, in place of that poor Jehan Daiz; then captain of the Chateau of Loches; then governor of Saint- Quentin; then captain of the bridge of Meulan, of which you cause yourself to be called comte. Out of the five sols fine paid by every barber who shaves on a festival day, there are three sols for you and we have the rest. We have been good enough to change your name of Le Mauvais (The Evil), which resembled your face too closely. In \u002776, we granted you, to the great displeasure of our nobility, armorial bearings of a thousand colors, which give you the breast of a peacock. ~Pasque-Dieu~! Are not you surfeited? Is not the draught of fishes sufficiently fine and miraculous? Are you not afraid that one salmon more will make your boat sink? Pride will be your ruin, gossip. Ruin and disgrace always press hard on the heels of pride. Consider this and hold your tongue.\" * A lord having a right on the woods of his vassals. These words, uttered with severity, made Master Olivier\u0027s face revert to its insolence. \"Good!\" he muttered, almost aloud, \"\u0027tis easy to see that the king is ill to-day; he giveth all to the leech.\" Louis XI. far from being irritated by this petulant insult, resumed with some gentleness, \"Stay, I was forgetting that I made you my ambassador to Madame Marie, at Ghent. Yes, gentlemen,\" added the king turning to the Flemings, \"this man hath been an ambassador. There, my gossip,\" he pursued, addressing Master Olivier, \"let us not get angry; we are old friends. \u0027Tis very late. We have terminated our labors. Shave me.\" Our readers have not, without doubt, waited until the present moment to recognize in Master Olivier that terrible Figaro whom Providence, the great maker of dramas, mingled so artistically in the long and bloody comedy of the reign of Louis XI. We will not here undertake to develop that singular figure. This barber of the king had three names. At court he was politely called Olivier le Daim (the Deer); among the people Olivier the Devil. His real name was Olivier le Mauvais. Accordingly, Olivier le Mauvais remained motionless, sulking at the king, and glancing askance at Jacques Coictier. \"Yes, yes, the physician!\" he said between his teeth. \"Ah, yes, the physician!\" retorted Louis XI., with singular good humor; \"the physician has more credit than you. \u0027Tis very simple; he has taken hold upon us by the whole body, and you hold us only by the chin. Come, my poor barber, all will come right. What would you say and what would become of your office if I were a king like Chilperic, whose gesture consisted in holding his beard in one hand? Come, gossip mine, fulfil your office, shave me. Go get what you need therefor.\" Olivier perceiving that the king had made up his mind to laugh, and that there was no way of even annoying him, went off grumbling to execute his orders. The king rose, approached the window, and suddenly opening it with extraordinary agitation,-- \"Oh! yes!\" he exclaimed, clapping his hands, \"yonder is a redness in the sky over the City. \u0027Tis the bailiff burning. It can be nothing else but that. Ah! my good people! here you are aiding me at last in tearing down the rights of lordship!\" Then turning towards the Flemings: \"Come, look at this, gentlemen. Is it not a fire which gloweth yonder?\" The two men of Ghent drew near. \"A great fire,\" said Guillaume Rym. \"Oh!\" exclaimed Coppenole, whose eyes suddenly flashed, \"that reminds me of the burning of the house of the Seigneur d\u0027Hymbercourt. There must be a goodly revolt yonder.\" \"You think so, Master Coppenole?\" And Louis XI.\u0027s glance was almost as joyous as that of the hosier. \"Will it not be difficult to resist?\" \"Cross of God! Sire! Your majesty will damage many companies of men of war thereon.\" \"Ah! I! \u0027tis different,\" returned the king. \"If I willed.\" The hosier replied hardily,-- \"If this revolt be what I suppose, sire, you might will in vain.\" \"Gossip,\" said Louis XI., \"with the two companies of my unattached troops and one discharge of a serpentine, short work is made of a populace of louts.\" The hosier, in spite of the signs made to him by Guillaume Rym, appeared determined to hold his own against the king. \"Sire, the Swiss were also louts. Monsieur the Duke of Burgundy was a great gentleman, and he turned up his nose at that rabble rout. At the battle of Grandson, sire, he cried: \u0027Men of the cannon! Fire on the villains!\u0027 and he swore by Saint-George. But Advoyer Scharnachtal hurled himself on the handsome duke with his battle-club and his people, and when the glittering Burgundian army came in contact with these peasants in bull hides, it flew in pieces like a pane of glass at the blow of a pebble. Many lords were then slain by low-born knaves; and Monsieur de Chateau-Guyon, the greatest seigneur in Burgundy, was found dead, with his gray horse, in a little marsh meadow.\" \"Friend,\" returned the king, \"you are speaking of a battle. The question here is of a mutiny. And I will gain the upper hand of it as soon as it shall please me to frown.\" The other replied indifferently,-- \"That may be, sire; in that case, \u0027tis because the people\u0027s hour hath not yet come.\" Guillaume Rym considered it incumbent on him to intervene,-- \"Master Coppenole, you are speaking to a puissant king.\" \"I know it,\" replied the hosier, gravely. \"Let him speak, Monsieur Rym, my friend,\" said the king; \"I love this frankness of speech. My father, Charles the Seventh, was accustomed to say that the truth was ailing; I thought her dead, and that she had found no confessor. Master Coppenole undeceiveth me.\" Then, laying his hand familiarly on Coppenole\u0027s shoulder,-- \"You were saying, Master Jacques?\" \"I say, sire, that you may possibly be in the right, that the hour of the people may not yet have come with you.\" Louis XI. gazed at him with his penetrating eye,-- \"And when will that hour come, master?\" \"You will hear it strike.\" \"On what clock, if you please?\" Coppenole, with his tranquil and rustic countenance, made the king approach the window. \"Listen, sire! There is here a donjon keep, a belfry, cannons, bourgeois, soldiers; when the belfry shall hum, when the cannons shall roar, when the donjon shall fall in ruins amid great noise, when bourgeois and soldiers shall howl and slay each other, the hour will strike.\" Louis\u0027s face grew sombre and dreamy. He remained silent for a moment, then he gently patted with his hand the thick wall of the donjon, as one strokes the haunches of a steed. \"Oh! no!\" said he. \"You will not crumble so easily, will you, my good Bastille?\" And turning with an abrupt gesture towards the sturdy Fleming,-- \"Have you never seen a revolt, Master Jacques?\" \"I have made them,\" said the hosier. \"How do you set to work to make a revolt?\" said the king. \"Ah!\" replied Coppenole, \"\u0027tis not very difficult. There are a hundred ways. In the first place, there must be discontent in the city. The thing is not uncommon. And then, the character of the inhabitants. Those of Ghent are easy to stir into revolt. They always love the prince\u0027s son; the prince, never. Well! One morning, I will suppose, some one enters my shop, and says to me: \u0027Father Coppenole, there is this and there is that, the Demoiselle of Flanders wishes to save her ministers, the grand bailiff is doubling the impost on shagreen, or something else,\u0027--what you will. I leave my work as it stands, I come out of my hosier\u0027s stall, and I shout: \u0027To the sack?\u0027 There is always some smashed cask at hand. I mount it, and I say aloud, in the first words that occur to me, what I have on my heart; and when one is of the people, sire, one always has something on the heart: Then people troop up, they shout, they ring the alarm bell, they arm the louts with what they take from the soldiers, the market people join in, and they set out. And it will always be thus, so long as there are lords in the seignories, bourgeois in the bourgs, and peasants in the country.\" \"And against whom do you thus rebel?\" inquired the king; \"against your bailiffs? against your lords?\" \"Sometimes; that depends. Against the duke, also, sometimes.\" Louis XI. returned and seated himself, saying, with a smile,-- \"Ah! here they have only got as far as the bailiffs.\" At that instant Olivier le Daim returned. He was followed by two pages, who bore the king\u0027s toilet articles; but what struck Louis XI. was that he was also accompanied by the provost of Paris and the chevalier of the watch, who appeared to be in consternation. The spiteful barber also wore an air of consternation, which was one of contentment beneath, however. It was he who spoke first. \"Sire, I ask your majesty\u0027s pardon for the calamitous news which I bring.\" The king turned quickly and grazed the mat on the floor with the feet of his chair,-- \"What does this mean?\" \"Sire,\" resumed Olivier le Daim, with the malicious air of a man who rejoices that he is about to deal a violent blow, \"\u0027tis not against the bailiff of the courts that this popular sedition is directed.\" \"Against whom, then?\" \"Against you, sire?\u0027 The aged king rose erect and straight as a young man,-- \"Explain yourself, Olivier! And guard your head well, gossip; for I swear to you by the cross of Saint-L? that, if you lie to us at this hour, the sword which severed the head of Monsieur de Luxembourg is not so notched that it cannot yet sever yours!\" The oath was formidable; Louis XI. had only sworn twice in the course of his life by the cross of Saint-L?. Olivier opened his mouth to reply. \"Sire--\" \"On your knees!\" interrupted the king violently. \"Tristan, have an eye to this man.\" Olivier knelt down and said coldly,-- \"Sire, a sorceress was condemned to death by your court of parliament. She took refuge in Notre-Dame. The people are trying to take her from thence by main force. Monsieur the provost and monsieur the chevalier of the watch, who have just come from the riot, are here to give me the lie if this is not the truth. The populace is besieging Notre-Dame.\" \"Yes, indeed!\" said the king in a low voice, all pale and trembling with wrath. \"Notre-Dame! They lay siege to our Lady, my good mistress in her cathedral!--Rise, Olivier. You are right. I give you Simon Radin\u0027s charge. You are right. \u0027Tis I whom they are attacking. The witch is under the protection of this church, the church is under my protection. And I thought that they were acting against the bailiff! \u0027Tis against myself!\" Then, rendered young by fury, he began to walk up and down with long strides. He no longer laughed, he was terrible, he went and came; the fox was changed into a hyaena. He seemed suffocated to such a degree that he could not speak; his lips moved, and his fleshless fists were clenched. All at once he raised his head, his hollow eye appeared full of light, and his voice burst forth like a clarion: \"Down with them, Tristan! A heavy hand for these rascals! Go, Tristan, my friend! slay! slay!\" This eruption having passed, he returned to his seat, and said with cold and concentrated wrath,-- \"Here, Tristan! There are here with us in the Bastille the fifty lances of the Vicomte de Gif, which makes three hundred horse: you will take them. There is also the company of our unattached archers of Monsieur de Chateaupers: you will take it. You are provost of the marshals; you have the men of your provostship: you will take them. At the H?tel Saint-Pol you will find forty archers of monsieur the dauphin\u0027s new guard: you will take them. And, with all these, you will hasten to Notre-Dame. Ah! messieurs, louts of Paris, do you fling yourselves thus against the crown of France, the sanctity of Notre-Dame, and the peace of this commonwealth! Exterminate, Tristan! exterminate! and let not a single one escape, except it be for Montfau?on.\" Tristan bowed. \"\u0027Tis well, sire.\" He added, after a silence, \"And what shall I do with the sorceress?\" This question caused the king to meditate. \"Ah!\" said he, \"the sorceress! Monsieur d\u0027Estouteville, what did the people wish to do with her?\" \"Sire,\" replied the provost of Paris, \"I imagine that since the populace has come to tear her from her asylum in Notre- Dame, \u0027tis because that impunity wounds them, and they desire to hang her.\" The king appeared to reflect deeply: then, addressing Tristan l\u0027Hermite, \"Well! gossip, exterminate the people and hang the sorceress.\" \"That\u0027s it,\" said Rym in a low tone to Coppenole, \"punish the people for willing a thing, and then do what they wish.\" \"Enough, sire,\" replied Tristan. \"If the sorceress is still in Notre-Dame, must she be seized in spite of the sanctuary?\" \"~Pasque-Dieu~! the sanctuary!\" said the king, scratching his ear. \"But the woman must be hung, nevertheless.\" Here, as though seized with a sudden idea, he flung himself on his knees before his chair, took off his hat, placed it on the seat, and gazing devoutly at one of the leaden amulets which loaded it down, \"Oh!\" said he, with clasped hands, \"our Lady of Paris, my gracious patroness, pardon me. I will only do it this once. This criminal must be punished. I assure you, madame the virgin, my good mistress, that she is a sorceress who is not worthy of your amiable protection. You know, madame, that many very pious princes have overstepped the privileges of the churches for the glory of God and the necessities of the State. Saint Hugues, bishop of England, permitted King Edward to hang a witch in his church. Saint-Louis of France, my master, transgressed, with the same object, the church of Monsieur Saint-Paul; and Monsieur Alphonse, son of the king of Jerusalem, the very church of the Holy Sepulchre. Pardon me, then, for this once. Our Lady of Paris, I will never do so again, and I will give you a fine statue of silver, like the one which I gave last year to Our Lady of Ecouys. So be it.\" He made the sign of the cross, rose, donned his hat once more, and said to Tristan,-- \"Be diligent, gossip. Take Monsieur Chateaupers with you. You will cause the tocsin to be sounded. You will crush the populace. You will seize the witch. \u0027Tis said. And I mean the business of the execution to be done by you. You will render me an account of it. Come, Olivier, I shall not go to bed this night. Shave me.\" Tristan l\u0027Hermite bowed and departed. Then the king, dismissing Rym and Coppenole with a gesture,-- \"God guard you, messieurs, my good friends the Flemings. Go, take a little repose. The night advances, and we are nearer the morning than the evening.\" Both retired and gained their apartments under the guidance of the captain of the Bastille. Coppenole said to Guillaume Rym,-- \"Hum! I have had enough of that coughing king! I have seen Charles of Burgundy drunk, and he was less malignant than Louis XI. when ailing.\" \"Master Jacques,\" replied Rym, \"\u0027tis because wine renders kings less cruel than does barley water.\" 读者也许还没忘记，伽西莫多在发现那群黑压压的乞丐之前，在高高的钟楼上眺望过巴黎，那时他只看见一星亮光在圣安东尼门边一座高大阴暗建筑的顶楼窗户里闪烁。那座建筑就是巴士底狱，那一星亮光，是路易十一的蜡烛。 国王路易十一的确已经来到巴黎两天了，他后天就要动身到他的蒙第·莱·杜尔城堡去。他是很少到漂亮京城巴黎来的，即便来了，也只作短期逗留，因为他觉得他周围的活门、绞刑架和苏格兰射击手都还不够多。 那天他在巴士底狱过夜。他不大喜欢卢浮宫里他那间一百呎见方的大寝室，那雕刻着十二只巨兽和十三位伟大预言家的大壁炉，那张十二呎长十一呎宽的大床。在那什么都大的房间里，他觉得茫然若失。这位市民习气的国王比较喜欢巴士底的一个小房间，一张小床，何况巴士底比卢浮宫更为坚固。 国王在那著名监狱里住的小房间仍然是相当大的，占据着望楼最高的一层。那是一个圆形的斗室，地板上铺着光滑的草席，天花板上的椽子装饰着镀金百合花，用彩色木条间隔着，富丽的板壁上缀满了白锡做的蔷薇，漆成靛青和紫堇混合的鲜绿色。 房间里只有一个带铜丝格子和铁栅的尖拱形窗户，那画着国王和王后纹章的上等彩色玻璃窗扇有些阴暗，它的每一个窗棂就值二十二个索尔。 那个房间只有一个进口，一道时髦的圆拱门，里边挂着布帘，外面那爱尔兰木料的门廊，是用一百五十年前在古老宅第里常见的那种细工修成的。 索瓦尔曾经失望地说：“它们虽然既不美观又妨碍进出，老人们却仍然不愿拆毁，仍然不顾一切地把它们保存下来。” 在那房间里找不出任何一种普通房间里常见的家具，没有板凳，台子，架子，既没有箱子般的方凳，也没有四索尔一只的漂亮的柱脚凳，只能看到一张富丽堂皇的安乐椅，红漆木料上绘着许多玫瑰花，科尔多瓦的红皮椅座上镶着丝边，上面钉着许多金的钉子。看得出房间里这把唯一的坐椅是只有一个人有权坐在上面的。安乐椅旁边靠窗的地方，有一张铺着百鸟织锦台布的桌子，桌上放着一个满是墨渍的文件夹，几张羊皮纸，几枝羽毛笔和一个镂花大银杯。再远一点有一个炭盆，一张铺着绣花红绒台毯的祈祷台。房间尽头放着一张朴素的床，挂着金红色缎子幛幔，幛幔上除了朴素的条纹之外，没有金银线的镶边和亮片，穗子也不算考究。由于路易十一在上面入睡或失眠而出了名的这张床，两百年前在内阁大臣的府邸内还能看到，用阿里西第和“活道德”的笔名写《西须斯》那本书的老皮鲁夫人就看见过它。 这就是号称“法王路易陛下的祈祷室”的那个房间。 我们给读者介绍这个房间的时候，它是相当暗的，灭灯钟在一个钟头之前就响过了，夜已经很深，只有一支摇晃的蜡烛放在桌上，照见房间里分别站在几处的五个人。 烛光首先照到的那个贵人穿着华丽的长袜，深红色闪银条纹的紧身背心，一件金色作底上绣黑色图案的罩衣。被烛光照着的这身灿烂的衣服，好象每个褶纹都在发亮。穿这件衣服的人胸前挂着一枚色彩鲜艳的徽章，徽章是山形的，底下有一只跑着的梅花鹿，徽章左边配着一条橄榄枝，右边配着一只鹿角。他腰边佩着一把漂亮的匕首，镀银的刀柄雕刻成山峰形状，峰顶象伯爵的帽子。他高傲地抬着头，神情刁恶。从他的脸上第一眼可以看出他的傲慢，第二眼可以看出他的奸猾。 他手里拿着一叠纸张，光着脑袋直直地站在安乐椅旁边，椅上坐着一个衣着极不考究的人物，弓着背，架起一条腿，手靠在桌上。请想象一下搭在大红科尔多瓦皮垫上的两条细长腿，两只穿黑毛袜的瘦脚和那裹在皮领斜纹布外套里的身子吧！那皮领上的毛都快掉完了。最后是一顶用最坏的黑布做成的又旧又脏的帽子，帽沿饰着一串铅铸的肖像，还有一顶把头发盖得严严的睡帽，这就是从那坐在椅上的人身上能看到的一切了。他的头低垂在胸前，要不是烛光照着他的鼻子尖，简直就完全看不见他那被黑影遮住的脸孔了。 鼻子一定很长。由于那布满皱纹的双手，可以猜想到他是一个老年人。这人就是路易十一。 在他们身后不远，有两个弗朗德勒装束的人在低声交谈，阴影没有完全遮住他们，假若甘果瓦的戏剧演出时在场的人们中有一个来到这里，一定会认得他们就是弗朗德勒使臣当中的两位，一位是刚城有远见的养老金领取人居约姆·韩，另一位是群众喜爱的袜店老板雅克·科勃诺尔。人们记得这两人是参与路易十一的政治机密的。 最后，在最远的地方快靠近房门那儿，在黑暗中纹丝不动地站着一个象石像一般矮胖结实的人，穿着军服和绣有纹章的外套，方方的脸上长着一对凸出的眼睛，咧着一张大嘴，两只耳朵被垂下的头发遮住，看不见额头，样子又象狗又象老虎。 除了国王，其余的人都能让人看清楚。 站在国王跟前的贵人正在给他读着一篇长长的账目，国王似乎在留心倾听。那两个弗朗德勒人在交头接耳地谈话。 “上帝的十字架作证！”科勃诺尔嘀咕道，“我可站够哪！这里就没有椅子吗？” 韩摇摇头不安地笑了一下。 “凭上帝的十字架起誓！”科勃诺尔不得不放低声音说道，“我情愿坐在地上，架着腿，就象我在自己店铺里当我的袜店老板那样。” “安静点吧，雅克老板！” “什么！居约姆先生，难道在这儿就只好站着吗？” “要不然就跪着。”居约姆·韩说。 这时国王说起话来，他们就都缄口不语了。 “我的仆人的衣服要五十个索尔，给我做王冠的人的外套要花十二个索尔！就这样把黄金成吨地往外倒呀！你疯了吗？奥里维？” 老人这样说着就抬起头来，看得见他脖子上闪亮着圣米歇尔项链的金坠子，烛光把他瘦削阴沉的脸孔整个儿照亮了。他从那个人手里把那叠纸夺了过来。 “你要叫我们破产哪！”他用深陷的眼睛仔细看着那份账单嚷道，“这都是些什么？我们干吗要这么大的房子？两个教诲师，每人每月十里弗！一个礼拜堂神甫要一百索尔一月！一个寝室侍者要九十里弗一年！四个厨房的主膳官每人每年一百二十里弗！一个烤肉师傅，一个果园管理人，一个管调料的人，一个大厨师，一个司膳，两个助手，都是每人十里弗一月！两个厨役，每人十八里弗一月！一个马夫和两个助手，每人二十四里弗一月！一个脚夫，一个糕饼师傅，一个面包师傅，两个车夫，每人六十里弗一年！还有铁厂管理人，一百二十里弗一年！还有我们的国库管理局局长，一千二百里弗一年！审计官五百里弗一年！我怎能知道还有些什么！这是发疯啊！为了我们这些日常开支，就会把法兰西搜刮空了！卢浮宫里的金锭银锭都会被这种浪费的火熔化掉呢！我们会因此卖掉我们的碗碟！到了明年，假若上帝和圣母（说到这里他举起帽子）还允许我们活着，我们也只好用锡罐子喝药汁了！” 他一面说一面朝桌上的大银杯看了一眼，咳嗽了一声接着说道：“奥里维先生，象国王和皇帝这些统治大国的君主，可不能让自己家里有浪费现象，因为宫中的火灾一定会蔓延到各省。别让我再重复讲了，奥里维先生，我们的费用年年都在增多，这种事情我不喜欢。怎么，天知道！七九年以前没有超出过三万六千里弗，到八○ 年就是四万三千六百十九里弗，我记得清这个数目。八一年是六万六千六百八十里弗，今年呀，我打赌，准得到八万里弗！四年工夫就增加了一倍，真是骇人！” 他喘息着停顿了一下，随后焦躁地说道：“在我周围我只看到那些利用我的消瘦来使自己肥胖起来的人，你们从我每个毛孔里吸出钱来！” 大家都没说话，这是那种只好任其发泄的恼怒。他接着说道：“这就象法国贵族们的拉丁文请愿书，说要重建他们所谓大规模的王室。的确是大规模！可以压碎人的大规模！啊，先生们！你们说我不象一个国王，没有总管，没有侍臣便统治国家。我要让你们看看，天知道！看看我究竟是不是一个国王！” 说到这里，他觉得自己有权，便微笑了一下，脾气缓和些了，便转身向那两个弗朗德勒人说道：“你看见吗，居约姆老弟，大面包师、大总管、大侍从、大执事，还不如一个下等仆人。记住我的话，居约姆老弟，他们一点用处都没有，他们在国王跟前毫无用处，只让我想起王宫里那座大钟钟面周围的四个福音使者，菲立浦·伯西耶最近才把它修理一新，它们都是镀金的，可是它们并不能指示时辰，时针没有它们完全可以。” 他若有所思地停顿了一下，又摇着他老态龙钟的脑袋说：“嗬！嗬！我可不是菲立浦·伯西耶，我才不去给那些大臣镀金呢。我赞同爱德华王的意见：拯救平民，杀掉贵族！念下去吧，奥里维！” 他指的那个人双手捧起那份账单高声朗读起来：“付京城总督之印章保管人亚当·德隆为该印章镀金与雕刻之费用，该印章新近制成，因前一印章已破旧不复能用。十二个巴黎里弗。 “付居约姆·弗埃尔四个巴黎里弗另四个索尔，因彼在今年正月二月三月饲养杜尔内尔大厦两只鸽笼中之鸽子，又为此付彼七夸特另六分之一大麦。 “付罪犯忏悔用的僧帽一顶，四个巴黎索尔。” 国王静悄悄地听着，有时咳嗽一声，这当儿他把大银杯举到嘴边，做着怪样子呷了一口。 “今年曾奉司法官通知，于巴黎各个街口装设五十六只扩音器，此笔账目应予付清。 “为了寻找和发掘据云埋藏在巴黎和别处的金银，但并未找到，付四十五个巴黎里弗。” “埋藏了一个小钱，却要花一个索尔去挖掘！”国王说。 “……在杜尔内尔大厦放大铁笼的地方安装六块白玻璃壁板，付十三索尔。 “奉国王旨意，于怪物节做四个挂在铠甲上的盾形徽章，周围装饰一圈玫瑰花，付六里弗。 “为国王的旧上衣做两只新衣袖，付二十索尔。 “付国王擦皮靴的靴油一瓶，十五德尼埃。 “付为放国王黑猪之新猪栏一个，三十巴黎里弗。 “为关闭圣保尔大厦里的一群狮子，付墙壁地板门窗等费用二十二里弗。” “这些野兽真费钱呀！”路易十一说，“没关系！这是国王的豪华气派。 有一匹赭红色的大狮子，我很喜欢它那文雅劲儿。你看见过它吗，居约姆先生？君王们应该有些珍奇的动物。我们这些国王，应该有狮子一般的狗，老虎一般的猫，要这样大才和国王的权威相称。在信奉朱比特的异教时代，老百姓献给教堂一百头牛羊，帝王们就献一百头狮子和一百只老鹰。那才值得骄傲，才有气派呢。法兰西国王过去都曾有过一群禽兽在王座周围的。要不然，人们就会说我在这方面比我的祖先少花了钱，说我在那些狮子大熊大象豹子身上过于节省了。念下去吧，奥里维，我愿意把这些情况告诉我的弗朗德勒朋友们。” 居约姆·韩深深地弯腰行礼，科勃诺尔却摆出一副不高兴的样子，活象一只国王陛下刚才提到的大熊。国王没有注意到这些，他正把嘴伸到大银杯边上，把刚才喝下去的药汁吐出来并且说道：“呸！讨厌的药汁！”那个人接着往下朗读：“付六个月来关在屠宰房听候发落的一个拦路抢劫犯的伙食费，六里弗另四素尔。” “这是怎么回事？”国王插话道，“喂养要处绞刑的人！天知道！我决不再为这种喂养付出一个索尔。奥里维，去同代斯杜特维尔先生商量一下，今天晚上就给我准备好，让那个该处绞刑的家伙去同绞刑架结婚！再念下去！” 奥里维用大拇指在关于“拦路抢劫犯”那笔账目上做了个记号，又继续念道：“付巴黎法庭总刽子手昂里耶·库赞共六巴黎索尔，此系巴黎总督大人审定，为遵照总督大人命令，购一大宽薄刀，为判处死刑之人处斩时之用，备有刀鞘及其他零件。又付修理处斩路易·德·卢森堡先生时折损之旧刀之费用，以便再用该刀……” 国王插话道：“够了，我完全同意这笔费用，我是不在乎这种花费的，我从来不后悔用这种钱。继续念吧！” “为制造一崭新大囚笼……” “啊！”国王双手抓住安乐椅的扶手说，“我知道我到这个巴士底来是专为某件事的。等一等，奥里维先生，我想亲自去看看那个笼子，你可以在我观看的时候把它的价钱念给我听。弗朗德勒的先生们，来看看这个吧，挺别致的呢。” 于是他站了起来，扶着同他谈话的那个人的胳膊，做了个手势，叫直直地立在房门口的那个哑巴似的人在前面带路，叫那两个弗朗德勒人跟在后面，走出了那个房间。 由拿着笨重铁器的人和瘦长的执着蜡烛的年轻侍卫组成的国王的卫队赶快聚到房门口来，他们把黑暗的堡垒巡逻了一遍，堡垒所有的楼梯和走廊都是嵌进厚厚的墙壁里的。巴士底典狱长走在前头，把那些便门一道道在伛偻的老国王前面打开，国王一路走一路咳嗽。 除了因年老而弯腰驼背的国王之外，大家走过每一道门时都不得不把脑袋低下来。“嗯，”他咬着牙龈（因为他已经老掉牙了）说道，“我们都已经离坟墓的门不远哪。低矮的门，就得弓着身子才过得去。” 最后到了一道锁着好几把锁的门前，费了一刻钟才把门打开，大家走进了一个高朗的尖拱顶的大厅，顺着烛光望去，看得见大厅中央放着一个用砖头、铁和木料做成的中空的立方体，这就是那种叫做“国王的小女儿”的关犯人的著名囚笼。笼壁上有两三个小窗洞，都密密地装着铁条，看不见窗上的玻璃。门是用一块大石板做的，象墓门一样，只为了让人一进去就永远不出来。可是，在那里面的并不是一个死人，而是一个活人。 国王慢慢地绕着这个象房子一样的东西一面走一面仔细察看，奥里维先生跟在他身后大声朗读那篇账单：“新制大木笼一个，装有粗栅栏梁木和底板，宽八呎，长九呎，从顶到底高七呎，用大铁板夹住，置于圣安东尼门的巴士底狱中一个房间内，奉国王陛下旨意，将原关在另一破囚笼中之犯人关入新笼。该新制囚笼共用去九十六根铁栅，五十二根支柱，十根十八呎长的梁木，共聘请十九个木匠在巴士底之庭院中砍削那些木料共二十天……” “顶刮刮的橡木呢！”国王敲了敲木笼说。 “为此笼共用去二百二十块八呎和九呎长的厚重铁夹板，”那一个接着念道，“其余为中等长度，并附带螺旋纽带等等，共用去铁三千七百三十五磅，连同钉于该木笼上之八只大铁钩与铁钉等，共用铁二百十八磅，尚未计算放置该笼之室内窗上之铁格，该室之铁门及其他杂物……” “竟用了这么多铁，”国王说道，“为了关押这样一个微不足道的人！” “……合计共付出三百十七里弗五索尔七德尼埃。” “天晓得！”国王嚷道。 路易十一最喜欢说的这句粗话好象把笼子里面一个什么人吵醒了，听得见铁链拖在地上的响声，一种好象来自坟墓的微弱的声音说道：“陛下，陛下！开恩吧！”但是看不见说话的人。 “三百十七里弗五索尔七德尼埃！”路易十一重复说。 囚笼里发出的悲惨的声音使包括奥里维在内的全体在场的人心寒起来，只有国王一人仿佛没有听见一般。奥里维遵照他的命令继续念账单，国王陛下继续冷冰冰地察看囚笼。 “……此外，付泥水匠二十七个巴黎里弗十四索尔，为窗上铁条挖掘洞孔，并为放置囚笼之室内铺设地板，因原有地板不堪承受新囚笼之重量。” 囚笼里又发出呻吟声：“开恩吧，陛下！我向您发誓，那个谋反的人是安吉尔的红衣主教先生，并不是我呀。” “泥水匠好心狠！往下念吧，奥里维！” 奥里维接着念道：“为制造窗户床架椅凳及其他物件，付木匠二十个巴黎里弗两索尔……” 那个声音接着说道：“哎，陛下！您不听我讲话么？我向您保证，写那篇东西给居耶恩大人的人并不是我，那是红衣主教巴吕！” “木匠够贵的呢。”国王说，“就是这些了吧？” “没完呢，陛下，为装置该室之玻璃窗，付玻璃匠四十六巴黎索尔八德尼埃。” “开恩呀，陛下！他们把我的全部财产都给了那些审判我的法官，把我的碗碟给了杜尔奇先生，把我的图书给了比埃尔·杜西阿尔先生，把我的地毯给了茹西雍的长官，这还不够么？我是无辜的呀！我在一个铁笼里关了十四年哪！开恩吧，陛下！您会在天堂里得到报偿呢！” “奥里维先生，”国王说道，“一共是多少？” “三百六十七巴黎里弗八索尔三德尼埃。” “圣母呀！”国王嚷道，“好一个贵得吓人的囚笼！” 他从奥里维手中夺过账单，掂着手指头计算起来，一面望望账单又望望囚笼。这时大家听见犯人在哭泣，那哭声在黑暗中非常凄惨，大家都脸色苍白地面面相觑。 “十四年了，陛下，已经十四年了！从一四六九年四月就开始关起。圣母在上，陛下，请听我说吧！您一直在温暖的阳光下幸福地生活，我呢，可怜的我，就不能再见天日了么？开恩吧，陛下！慈悲慈悲吧！宽仁是君王的美德，它能够平息愤怒的波浪。难道连陛下也认为为君的必须惩罚一切罪犯，这样他升天的时候才会愉快吗？何况我并没有背叛您呀，陛下，那是安吉尔的主教先生干的。我脚上系着一根大铁链，铁链末端坠着一个大铁球，重得不近情理。哎，陛下，请怜悯我吧！” “奥里维，”国王摇着头说，“我查出这上面把石灰开了二十索尔一桶，但实价不过十二索尔。你得把这笔账重算过。” 他转身背着那个囚犯往房外走去。那可怜的犯人看见烛光远了，声音静了，知道国王已经离去。“陛下！陛下！”他绝望地喊道。房门又关上了。 他再也看不见什么，只听到狱卒的沙哑的声音在他耳边响着，唱的是：若望·巴吕先生，他的主教职位已经丢掉了。 凡尔登的先生再也没有了，全都消灭了。 国王平静地回到了他的祈祷室，跟在他身后的侍卫们听见那个囚犯最后的悲惨的声音，全都吓呆了。国王陛下忽然回头对巴士底的典狱长说：“哎呀，囚笼里有个什么人吧？” “当然哪，陛下！”被这句问话惊呆了的典狱长说。 “那么是谁呢？” “凡尔登的主教先生。” 其实国王对这件事比谁都清楚，这不过是他的一种手法罢了。 “啊，”他好象才初次想起了似的，装出老实的神态说：“原来是居约姆·德·阿韩古尔，巴吕红衣主教的好朋友，一个挺不错的主教呢。” 过了一会，祈祷室的门重新打开又关上，进来的是我们在这一章开头给读者介绍过的那五个人，他们各自回到先前站着的地方，恢复了先前的姿态和低声的交谈。 国王离开祈祷室的时候，有人放了几件紧急公文在他的案头，国王亲手把封口拆开，随后急忙一件一件地翻阅着。他朝那个象内阁大臣一般侍立在他身边的奥里维做了一个手势，叫他拿起笔，也不告诉他公文的内容，只是低声把复文说给他听，他就怪不舒服地跪在桌前写起来。 居约姆·韩留神看着。 国王用很低的声音说着，弗朗德勒人一点也听不清复文里讲些什么，只掠到下面几句：“……用商业扶持那些富足的地区，用农业扶持那些贫穷的地区……让英格兰贵族看看我们的那四尊大炮：隆特尔，布拉邦，布尔·昂·伯雷斯，圣阿梅……炮兵部队使现代的战争更加合理了……致我们的朋友德·倍雷须尔先生……军队没有粮饷是无法维持的……” 有一次他提高了嗓门：“天知道！西西里国王竟象法兰西国王一般用黄蜡封他的信件，我们允许他这样做可是错误的。我的表兄德·勃艮第没有盖上印章。房屋宽大就证明他们享有完整的特权哪。把这个记上，奥里维老弟。” 还有一次他说道：“啊！啊！重要消息！我的皇兄又要求什么啦？”他中止了口授，把眼睛在一堆公文上看了一遍，“当然罗，德国强大得难以置信，但我们不会忘记这句老话：‘最漂亮的郡国是弗朗德勒，最漂亮的公国是米兰，最漂亮的王国是法兰西。’不是吗，弗朗德勒先生们？” 这回科勃诺尔和居约姆·韩一道躬身施礼了，袜店老板的爱国心被触动啦。 最后一件公文使路易十一皱起了眉头。“这是什么？”他嚷道，“抱怨起我们派在庇卡底的驻防军来了！奥里维，赶快写封信给卢奥元帅先生，就说军纪松弛了，说王室宪兵队、放逐的贵族、弓箭队和御前卫士不断伤害我的百姓，说这些军人在农民家里找到财物还不满意，还用大棍把他们赶出屋子而且还要到城里去拿美酒鱼肉及其他奢侈品，说国王知道全部情况，说我准备保护我的人民，不让他们遭受困苦、抢劫和伤害，说圣母在上，这是我的愿望，说我不同意让一个农村提琴师、理发师或士兵打扮得象个王子，穿上天鹅绒或丝绸的衣服，戴上金戒指，说上帝讨厌这种虚荣，说连我这样一个上等人，只要穿上那种每巴黎俄纳只值十六索尔的布缝成的衣服就满意了呢，说勤务兵先生也可以降低到穿这种价钱布料做成的衣服，说我吩咐并命令你们照办，致我的朋友德·卢奥先生。好了。” 他高声口授这封信，念念又停停，他刚念完就有人推门进来，一面害怕地跑进房一面嚷道：“王上！王上！巴黎发生了群众暴动哪！” 路易十一严厉的面色突然变了，不过那只是象电光般一闪而过，他压着怒火，只是用平静严肃的声音说道：“雅克老弟，你进来得太鲁莽了！” “王上！王上！造反哪！”跑得气喘的雅克说。 国王站起来抓住他的手臂，斜着眼睛望望两个弗朗德勒人，怒不可遏，但为了不让那两人听见，只好凑在他耳边悄声说：“别响！要不就小点声！” 刚进来的人明白了国王的意思，就低声向他报告一个可怕的情况，他留心地听着。这时居约姆·韩就叫科勃诺尔看那新来的人的面貌和服装，从那人的皮帽短披风和黑绒袍，一看就知道他是审计院院长。 这人才向国王解释了几句，路易十一就大笑起来：“真的呀！大声说吧，夸克纪埃老弟！你何必讲得这样轻声呢？圣母知道，我们对弗朗德勒的朋友是什么都不用隐瞒的。” “可是，王上……” “尽管大声讲！” 夸克纪埃“老弟”可惊讶得说不出话了。 “那么，”国王又说道，“讲吧，先生，在我们巴黎这座城市里有些平民骚动起来了，是吧？” “是的，王上。” “你说他们反对的是司法宫的大法官，是吗？” “好象是的，”那位“老弟”仍然十分惊讶国王突然莫名其妙地改变了想法，便结结巴巴地答道。 路易十一又说：“夜巡队是在哪里碰见那群人的呢？” “是在那群人从乞丐大本营到欧项热桥去的路上。我到这里来听取王上的旨意，路上也碰见了他们。我听见好几个人在喊‘打倒司法宫的法官！’” “他们对法官有什么仇恨呢？” “啊，”那雅克老弟说，“法官是他们的领主老爷呀！” “当然！” “对了，王上。他们都是圣迹区的乞丐，他们早就对法官不满了，他们是他的臣民呀，但他们不愿意承认他是审判官，也不承认他是路政官吏。” “啊呀！”国王露出忍不住的笑容说。 “在他们呈递给大理院的每份请愿书里，”雅克说，“他们希望只有您陛下和上帝才是他们的主人。他们的上帝大概就是魔鬼吧。” “嗯，嗯！”国王说。 他搓弄着双手，心里的欢笑流露到脸上来了，使他满脸放光。他虽然老在装腔作势，但仍然掩盖不住心头的高兴。谁也不明白这是怎么回事，连“奥里维先生”也弄不清，他好一会没说话，神色若有所思但很愉快。 “他们人数很多吗？”他突然问道。 “当然很多，王上，”雅克老弟回答。 “有多少人？” “不到六千。” 国王禁不住说了声“好！”接着又说，“他们带着兵器吗？” “他们拿着锉子、钻子、长矛、斧头等各种厉害的兵器。” 国王对这种夸耀的话一点也没表示惊慌，那个雅克老弟以为应该提醒他，于是说：“假若陛下不赶快派兵援救那个法官，他一定会完蛋。” “我们要派救兵去的，”国王装出认真的样子，“这很好，我们一定派救兵去。法官先生是我的朋友。六千！都是些亡命之徒，他们太大胆了，我为此很生气。但今夜我身边没有什么人可派。得等明天再说。” 雅克老弟叫喊起来：“王上，得即刻派救兵！要不然法官家里早给抢上二十次哪，领地会给抢空哪，法官也给绞死哪。看在上帝份上，陛下，天不亮就派救兵去吧！” 国王看着他的脸说：“我已经告诉你要等到明天早上。” 他的眼光使人不敢再望。 沉默了一会，路易十一又提高嗓门说：“我的雅克老弟，你应该知道，在哪个地区……”他重复道，“那法官的领地在哪个地区？” “王上，那法官的领地包括从加朗特街到蔬菜市街，包括圣米歇尔广场和郊区圣母院（国王听到这个字就举起帽子）旁边那些统称为垣墙的地带，那里有十三幢大厦，外加圣迹区和称作郊区的麻风病院，再加从这个麻风病院开始到圣雅克门的整段车道。他是这些地带的路政官，绝对的统治者，是高级的中级的和初级的审判官。” “怎么！”国王用右手抓抓左耳朵说：“这是我城市里的一块好地区呀！ 法官先生在这个地带称王呢！” 这回他不再说话了。他好象做梦似的自言自语道：“很好，法官先生，你可咬住我们巴黎的一块好地方哪！” 他忽然激动地说：“天知道！那些在我们这里当路政官、审判官、统治者和主人的家伙究竟是怎么回事？是谁让他们时时刻刻收通行税，谁让他们把法庭和刽子手安置在每条路口，安置在我的人民中间？正象希腊人看见几股泉水就以为有同样多的上帝，波斯人看见几颗星星就以为有同样多的神明一样，法国人会因为看见那么多刑台就以为有同样多的国王呢！天知道！这种事情太糟糕了，我不喜欢这种骚动。我很想知道，荣耀的上帝是否乐意在巴黎除了国王之外还有另一个路政官，除了大理院之外还有另一个司法机关，在这个帝国里除了我之外还有另一位帝王！凭我心里的法则起誓！应该会有那样的日子到来，那时法兰西只有一个国王，一个领主，一个法官，一个有权处斩刑的人，象天堂里只有一个上帝一样！” 他又举起帽子，仍然好象做梦似的接着说，神态和声调就象叫一群猎狗去追踪猎物的猎人那样：“好！我的百姓们！好极了！推翻那些假冒的领主！ 干你们的吧！进攻！进攻！打倒他们，杀掉他们，绞死他们！啊！你们都想当国王吗，大人们？干吧，老百姓，干吧！” 说到这里他忽然停住，咬着嘴唇似乎想要捉住已经溜掉一半的思路，不断用锐利的眼睛打量他周围五个人中的每一个。他忽然双手把帽子捧起来呆呆地瞧着，并且向它喊道：“要是你知道我脑子里此刻有些什么想法，我就要把你烧掉！” 随后他重新环顾四周，眼光就象刚刚溜回洞穴的狐狸一般机警和不安：“这不要紧！我们要支援法官先生，可惜我们此时此地只有很少的军队，不足以抵挡那样多的人，得等到明天再说。传令到旧城区去，叫把抓到的人狠狠地绞死。” “啊，王上！”夸克纪埃老弟说，“我一慌就忘了这件事：夜巡队抓到了那些暴民中的两个，假若陛下想看看那两个人，他们就在那边。” “还问我想不想看他们？”国王喊道，“天知道！你怎会忘掉这种事！ 你快跑去，奥里维，去把他们带来！” 奥里维先生出去一会就带着两个俘虏回来了，近卫弓箭队环立在那两人身边。第一个有一张醉醺醺的吓昏了的大胖脸，一身破烂，走起路来一拐一拐地拖着脚步。第二个是读者早就认识的那个笑嘻嘻的脸色苍白的人。 国王一言不发地观察了他们一会，随后突然向第一个问道：“你叫什么名字？” “吉佛华·潘斯布德。” “干什么的？” “讨饭的。” “你打算在那该死的暴动里干什么？” 那乞丐望着国王，昏迷地摇着胳膊，他的头脑是那种糟糕的头脑，智慧在那里就象火光在灭火器下面熄灭了一样。 “我不知道，”他说，“人家去，我也去。” “你们不是要去猛攻和抢劫你们的领主司法宫的大法官吗？” “我只知道他们要到什么人家里去拿点什么东西。” 一个兵士把从那个乞丐身上搜出的一把砍刀呈给国王看。 “你认得这件兵器么？” “认得，这是我的砍刀，我是种葡萄的。” “你认得你这个同伙吗？”路易十一指着另一个俘虏问。 “不，我不认识他。” “够哪，”国王说。他又向我们早已给读者提到过的那个站在门边的人说道：“特里斯丹老弟，这个人交给你发落。” 特里斯丹·莱尔米特躬身行礼，他低声吩咐两名弓箭手把那可怜的人带走。 这时国王走到第二个俘虏跟前，那个俘虏正在大颗地淌汗。 “你叫什么名字？” “王上，我叫比埃尔·甘果瓦。” “干什么的？” “我是个哲学家，王上。” “坏蛋！你怎么跟他们去围攻我的朋友法官先生呢？你对这个群众暴动有什么说的？” “王上，我没有参加暴动。” “啊，强盗！你不是被夜巡队从那群歹徒里抓来的么？” “不是呀，王上，他们弄错了，真是命该如此。我是写悲剧的，王上，请陛下听我陈述。我是个诗人，干我这行的人喜欢夜晚在街上行走。今天晚上我从那里经过，那完全是出于偶然，他们错逮了我。我同群众暴动的事毫无关系，陛下看见那个乞丐并不认识我。我向陛下发誓……” “住口！”国王喝了一口药汁说，“你闹得我头都胀破了！” 特里斯丹·莱尔米特走向前来，指着甘果瓦说道：“王上，这家伙也得绞死吧？” 这就是他首先想到的话。 “咳！”国王无所谓地答道，“我看这样也没什么不好。” “我看太不好哪！”甘果瓦说。 我们的诗人这时脸色比橄榄还青，看见国王那副冷冰冰的不高兴的样子，他就想到除了装出十分悲痛以外没有别的办法，于是他急忙跪在路易十一的脚前，绝望地指手划脚地喊道：“王上请赐恩，容我上禀。王上，不要对我这个微不足道的人大发雷霆，上帝的雷电不打莴苣。王上，您是一位极有权威的君主，请怜悯一个诚实的可怜的人。我不会谋反，正象冰块不会爆出火星一样！最仁慈的王上啊，宽厚是狮子同国王的美德。哎！严酷只能吓唬人们的心，凛冽的北风刮不掉行人的外衣，太阳的光辉照到行人身上，却能使他渐渐热起来，自动把外衣脱掉。王上就是太阳。我向王上保证，我至高无上的主人和君王，我并不是偷盗胡来的乞丐一流人物，叛乱和抢劫都不在阿波罗的随从里，我是不会混进那种能爆发出种种叛乱的乌云中去的，我是陛下的一个忠实仆人。丈夫为了妻子的名誉而起的妒嫉心，儿子为了爱他父母而起的孝心，一个奴仆应该拿这两种心情来爱他的国王的威名，他应该为忠于王室，为发展国王的大业效犬马之劳。假若他热中于别的感情，那除非是发疯。王上，这就是我的政治格言。那么，请不要因为我的衣袖破得连胳膊都露出来就断定我是谋反行劫的人。假若陛下对我开恩，我要每天早晚为陛下向上帝祈福！哎！我不怎么有钱，这是真的，我还相当穷苦呢。但这并不是什么缺点，这不是我的过错呀。谁都知道，巨富并不是用漂亮文章取得的，最有学问的人冬天还生不起一炉好火呢。律师拿去了全部谷物，却把干草留给从事别种科学事业的人。 我可以把有关四十位哲学家破烂衣服的绝妙笑话背给陛下听。啊，陛下，只有仁爱能够烛照伟大的灵魂。仁爱在一切德性之前高举火把。假若没有它，我们就只是些在黑暗里寻找上帝的瞎子哪。慈悲也同仁爱一样，它使臣民爱戴王上，这种爱戴是君王最好的护卫。陛下的威光使万物晕眩，大地上多了我这么个穷人——多了这么个空着肚子，空着钱包在悲苦的黑暗中摸索的贫穷无辜的哲学家，对陛下又有什么妨碍呢？而且，陛下，我是一个文人，那些伟大的国王的王冠上都有一颗保护文化的珍珠。赫拉克勒斯不轻视‘缪斯引进者’的称号，马蒂亚斯·果尔凡对著名数学家，若望·德·蒙华亚尔恩宠有加。可是，如今却用绞死文人的恶劣办法来代替保护文化哪。假若亚历山大把亚里斯多德绞死了，那该是多大的污点，这不是一个使他名望更高的美人痣，而是使他名声败坏的烂疮哪。王上呵，我给弗朗德勒的小姐和尊敬的太子殿下写了一篇贺婚诗，那可不是叛乱的号召呀。陛下看得出，我并不是个拙劣的作家，我是有学问的，有多种天才。对我开恩吧，这样王上也就是对我们的圣母做了一件功德哪，我向王上发誓，我是非常害怕给绞死的啊。” 悲苦的甘果瓦一面说一面去吻国王的拖鞋，这时居约姆·韩低声向科勃诺尔说：“他爬在地上算是做对了，国王们都象克里特的朱比特一般，耳朵长在脚上呀。”那个袜店老板并不去留心克里特的朱比特，却把眼睛盯住甘果瓦，微笑着回答道：“这多好！我相信是听见大臣雨果奈在求我开恩呢！” 甘果瓦喘着气说完了那篇话之后，战战兢兢地抬起眼睛去望国王，国王正在用指甲刮他裤子上膝盖部分的一个污点，随后国王喝了一口药水，一句话也不讲，这种沉默使甘果瓦好象受着苦刑。国王终于看了看他说：“真是个吵人精！”随后便回过头对特里斯丹·莱尔米特说道：“呸，放掉他吧！” 甘果瓦快乐得仰身昏倒了。 “放掉他！”特里斯丹埋怨道，“难道陛下不愿意让他在囚笼里关一阵吗？” “老弟，”国王说，“你以为我们这些值三百六十七里弗八索尔三德尼埃一个的笼子，是用来关这种鸟儿的么？只管把这家伙（路易十一喜欢用这个词，这个词和“天知道”都是他极高兴时经常用的）给我放掉，拿大棍子把他赶出去！” “啊！”甘果瓦喊道，“真是一位伟大的国王！” 担心国王再发出一个相反的命令，甘果瓦便急忙向房门口奔去，特里斯丹极其不高兴地给他开了门，兵士们拳脚交加地把他推了出来，甘果瓦用一种真正的斯多噶派哲学家的坚忍来忍受着这一切。 自从得知人们对法官造反的消息之后，国王的好脾气表现在一切方面，刚才这种罕见的宽仁就是一个不小的标志。特里斯丹依旧绷着脸站在那个角落里，好象一条狗看见了什么东西却又弄不到。 这时国王愉快地用手指头在靠椅扶手上敲起俄德梅桥的进行曲来了，这位国王挺会做作，但他能够比掩饰欢乐更巧妙地掩饰他的烦恼。这种明显地表现出来的欢乐，在得到好消息时往往会更加扩大，例如当勇敢的查理逝世的时候，他甚至立誓赠送杜尔的圣马尔丹教堂一道银栏杆；在他即位当国王的时候，他甚至忘记吩咐给他父王办理丧事。 “嗯，王上，”雅克·夸克纪埃忽然嚷起来，“陛下让我医治的那种厉害的病现在好些了么？” “啊，”国王说，“我实在很难受呢，我的老弟。我耳朵嗡嗡响，好象有很多烧红的铁耙在耙我的胸膛。” 夸克纪埃抓着国王的手腕，装出很自信的样子替他把起脉来。 “你瞧，科勃诺尔，”韩低声说道，“他就夹在夸克纪埃和特里斯丹的中间，他整个的朝廷都在这里了。一个医生是为他自己用的，一个刽子手是对付别人的。” 夸克纪埃给国王把着脉，装出愈来愈吃惊的样子，路易十一带着几分愁苦望着他。夸克纪埃的脸色愈来愈黯淡了，这家伙没有别的谋生之计，专门靠国王的病痛过日子，他尽可能地加以利用。 “啊！啊！”他终于喃喃道，“这会儿情况很严重。” “是吗？”国王不安地说。 “脉搏很快，不规则，跳动间歇……”那个医生接着说。 “天知道！” “不出三天就要人性命。” “圣母啊！”国王喊道，“怎么治疗呢，老弟！” “我正在想呢，王上。” 他使得国王咋舌，摇头，做出一副怪相，趁这机会他忽然说道：“天哪！ 我必须告诉您，有了一个肥缺啦。我正好有一个侄儿。” “我把空缺给你的侄儿，雅克老弟，”国王回答道，“可是得清清我胸里的内火。” “既然陛下如此宽厚，”医生又说，“对于我在圣安德烈·代·亚克街修建的房屋决不会拒绝给点帮助吧。” “嗯！”国王说。 “我的钱快用光了，”医生接着说，“那座房子没有屋顶真是可惜。倒不是为了那房子本身，那房子不过是简陋的民房罢了，倒是为了若望·富尔波的绘画，它使墙壁生色不少呢。有一幅空中飞翔的狄安娜，那么精致，那么温柔，那么文雅，姿态那么自然，头饰那么美好，戴着一顶新月形的帽子，皮肤非常洁白，走得太近一点去看的人真会受到诱惑呢。还有一幅色蕾丝，她也是一位异常美貌的女神，她坐在一捆麦秆上，戴着一顶麦穗编成的花冠，上面还编有波罗门参和别的花卉。再没有比她的眼睛更多情的了，再没有比她的腿更圆溜的了，再没有比她的仪态更高贵的了，再没有比她的衣裙更好的衣料了，她是画笔画得出来的美人中最美的一位。” “狠心的家伙！”路易十一嘀咕道，“你究竟想要什么？” “我需要一个屋顶来遮盖这些绘画，王上，这虽然不过是件小事，可是我没有钱呀。” “你那屋顶要多少钱？” “那……一个铜花边镀金的屋顶，顶多两千里弗。” “啊，凶手，”国王嚷道，“他连一颗牙都没有替我拔掉，倒想因此得到一颗宝石！” “我可以得到我的屋顶吗？”夸克纪埃问。 “可以！滚到魔鬼那儿去吧，可是先得把我医治好。” 夸克纪埃深深一鞠躬说：“王上，只需一服发散药就能救您的命。您得在腰上敷一种用蜡膏、亚美尼亚粘土、蛋清、油和醋调配的特效药，您必须继续喝您的药汁。我会报答陛下的。” 一支点燃的蜡烛不单是招引一只飞蛾，奥里维先生看见国王毫不在乎的样子，以为正是好机会，也走向前来说道：“王上……” “又是什么事，”路易十一问。 “陛下知道西蒙·拉丹先生死去了吗？” “那又怎样？” “他是在财产审判方面代表国王的顾问官呀！” “那又怎样？” “他的职位现在空着。” 这样说着，奥里维先生那副傲慢的面孔失去了傲慢，变得卑躬屈节起来，这是可以看清楚廷臣本来面目的唯一时机。国王直楞楞地看着他的脸，用毫无表情的腔调说：“我明白哪。” 接着他又说道：“奥里维先生，布西科元帅说过：‘只有国王那里才有赏赐，只有大海里才有鱼。’我看你同布西科先生的意见倒很一致。现在你听着：我的记性是很好的，六八年我让你当了我的内侍；六九年我让你当了圣克鲁桥的堡垒管理人，年俸一百杜尔里弗（你想要的是巴黎里弗）；七三年十一月，为了送信到吉尔日阿尔的功劳，我让你代替骑士盾手吉倍尔·阿克尔当上了凡赛纳森林的护林宫；七八年因为送交几份用双重绿蜡封口的信件，我恩赐你和你妻子每年在圣日尔曼学校的商业广场收用十个巴黎里弗；七九年让你代替可怜的若望·代兹当塞纳尔森林的护林官，后来又当洛奇堡垒的上尉，后来又当圣刚丹的长官，后来又当麦浪桥的上尉。你叫人称呼你是伯爵。每个理发师在节日里交纳的五个索尔中，有三个是归你的，剩下的才归我。我很想把你的名字改成‘坏蛋’，那同你的面目太符合了。七四年，我让你穿上了胸前象孔雀开屏那样五彩缤纷的铠甲，虽然那非常令我不高兴。 天晓得！你还不满意吗？你捕鱼的本领还不神妙吗？你不怕再加一条鲑鱼就会把你的船翻沉吗？骄傲会使你倒霉的，我的老弟，骄傲后面往往紧跟着毁灭和羞辱呢。想想这些，并且闭上你的嘴。” 国王严厉地说出的这些话，使奥里维先生又恢复了先前那种傲慢的神情。“好呀，”他大声嘀咕道，“国王今天显然生病哪，他把什么都给了医生。” 路易十一并没有因为这句无礼的话恼怒起来，反而温和地说道：“咳，我还忘记说我让你在玛丽夫人身边当了刚城的使臣呢。是呀，先生们，”国王回过头对两个弗朗德勒人说道，“这人是我的公使哪。”“得，我的老弟，” 他又向奥里维先生说，“咱俩不会闹翻的，咱俩是老朋友呀。我的公事已经办完了，给我刮胡子吧。” 我们的读者大概没想到会从这位奥里维先生身上认出那可怕的费加罗来吧？老天这一位伟大的戏剧家，曾经把他放进路易十一那出冗长而流血的喜剧里。我们不想在这里对这一奇特的人物多加说明，这位国王的理发师有三个名字：在宫廷里人们有礼貌地称呼他为奥里维·勒丹；老百姓叫他魔鬼奥里维；而他的真名是坏蛋奥里维。 坏蛋奥里维一动不动地站在那里，愠怒地望着国王，又斜眼瞟瞟雅克·夸克纪埃。“是呀，是呀！这个医生！”他咬牙切齿地说。 “咳，是呀，这个医生，”路易十一神情古怪地说道，“医生可比你守信用得多呢。这是很简单的事，他抓住我们的是个身子，而你才不过碰到我们的下巴。来，我可怜的理发师，别再想了。假若我是象西尔倍里格一样的一个国王，老喜欢用一只手握着胡子，你又会怎么说呢，你的职务会变成什么样的呢？算了吧，我的老弟，专心于你的职务，给我刮胡子吧。去把你需要的东西拿来。” 看见国王笑起来，奥里维没办法再同他怄气了，只好嘀咕着出去找理发器具来执行他的吩咐。 国王起身走到窗前，忽然异常激动地把窗门打开。“啊，对了！”他拍着手喊道，“旧城区上空有一片红光，那是法官家里起的火。一定是这样。 啊，我的好百姓！你们终于帮助我来消灭领主啦！” 这时他转身向那两个弗朗德勒人说道：“先生们，到这里来看看，不是一片红红的火光吗？” 那两个刚城来的人走了过去。 “是一片大火，”居约姆·韩说道。 “啊，”科勃诺尔眼睛忽然亮闪闪地说道，“这使我想起了焚烧贵族安倍古府第时的情形。那边一定是发生了大暴动。” “你以为是这样吗，科勃诺尔先生？”路易十一的眼色几乎同那袜店老板一般愉快，“那不是很不容易抵御的吗？” “上帝的十字架作证！王上，那得要陛下好几团的战士呢！” “啊！那就是另一回事了，只要我愿意……” 那袜店老板大胆地回答道：“假若这次暴动是我猜想的那一种，你愿意也是枉然呀！王上！” “老弟，”路易十一说，“只要用我的两个近卫团和一尊大炮，就能把那些平民赶走。” 袜店老板可不管居约姆·韩向他做的暗示，好象决心要和国王争论一番。 “王上，那些教堂侍卫也不过是些平民。勃艮第公爵是一位伟大的绅士，他没把那些民众放在眼里。王上，在格郎松战役，公爵叫喊道：‘炮手们！ 向那些贱民开火！’他还用圣乔治的名义起誓。可是那个复仇者夏尔纳达尔带着大棒和他的人向那漂亮公爵冲过来，兵器发出闪光的勃艮第军队和那些肤色象水牛般的乡下人一交手，就象玻璃被石子打碎了一样。那一次有许多骑士被强盗杀死，勃艮第最大的领主夏多·居容和他那匹高大的灰色马一块儿死在一片泥沼里。” “朋友，”国王说，“你讲的那是一次战役，但这里却只是一次暴动。 只要我高兴，皱皱眉头就能够把它了结。” “那也可能，王上。假若是那样，那就是说属于人民的日子还没有到来。” 居约姆·韩认为应当干预了。“科勃诺尔先生，你是在同一位权威的国王讲话呀。” “我知道，”袜店老板严肃地答道。 “让他讲吧，我的朋友韩先生，”国王说，“我喜欢这样坦率的讲话。 我父亲查理七世常说真理生病了。我呢，我相信真理死掉了，它没找到一个听忏悔的神甫。科勃诺尔先生消除了我的疑惑。” 于是他亲热地把手搭在科勃诺尔肩膀上说：“科勃诺尔先生，那么您是说……” “王上，我是说您也许是对的，在您这里，属于人民的日子还没有到来。” 路易十一用他那洞察一切的眼睛望着他。 “那一天，何时到来呢，先生？” “您就快要听到它的钟声敲响哪。” “那是什么钟呀，请问？” 科勃诺尔神色庄严而镇静地叫国王走近窗前。“听我说吧，王上，这里有一个堡垒和一口警钟，有许多大炮，许多市民和许多士兵。当堡垒上敲起警钟，大炮齐鸣时，堡垒就要在喧闹声中倒坍，那时平民和士兵也大喊大叫，互相厮杀，这就是那一时刻到来哪。” 国王的脸色象在做梦一般阴暗恍惚，他好一会没说话。随后他轻轻地拍拍那堡垒的厚墙，好象在拍一匹战马的臀部。“啊，不会的！”他说，“你不是那么容易倒坍的吧，我的好巴士底？” 他突然转身问那大胆的弗朗德勒人：“你看见过暴动吗，雅克先生？” “我造过反呢。” “你是怎样造反的呢？”国王问。 “啊，”科勃诺尔回答道，“那并不怎么难办，有上百种办法呢。第一要那城里的人不满意，这种情况是常有的；再就要看居民们的气质如何，刚城的居民是很适合造反的。他们永远爱他们的君王，君王可从来不爱他们。 咳，我想那是一个早晨吧，人们走进我的店铺，向我说科勃诺尔伯伯，发生了这件事，又发生了那件事，那弗朗德勒小姐要救她那些大臣，大管家要把磨面费增加一倍，或者诸如此类的事情。于是我丢开活儿，走出店铺到了街上，我就喊道：‘抢吧！’那里经常有些空着的木桶，我站到桶上，大声讲出最先想到的话，这些话本来是早就在我心里的。当你站在老百姓一边的时候，王上，那你心头总是有话要说的。于是我们排成队伍，叫喊着并且敲响警钟，我们让平民都拿起从士兵手中夺过来的武器，市场上的人也参加进来，我们就干起来啦！永远是这样的，只要封邑里有领主，市镇里有居民，乡村里有农夫。” “你们是造谁的反呢？造你们那些法官的反吗？造你们那些领主的反吗？” “有时造他们的反，有时也造大公爵的反。” 路易十一走回去坐在椅上，微笑着说道：“在这里，他们还不过是在造法官的反呀！” 正在这当儿，奥里维走了进来，他身后跟着两个侍卫，捧着国王的梳洗用具，但使路易十一惊讶的，是同他们一起进来的还有巴黎总督和夜巡队队长，神色都很惊慌。那怨气未消的理发师也装出惊恐的样子，其实他心里挺高兴，正是他先开口说道：“王上，请陛下宽恕我向您报告一个坏消息。” 国王急忙转过身来，椅子脚把地板擦得直响：“什么消息？” “王上，”奥里维用那种由于能狠狠报复一下而觉得满意的恶毒的神态说，“这次暴动并不是造法官的反呀。” “那么是造谁的反呢？” “是造您的反，王上。” 老国王象年轻人一样直挺挺地站起来了：“奥里维，你得说清楚！好好保住你的脑袋，我的老弟。我凭圣洛的十字架起誓，假若你在这当儿对我撒谎，那把砍过卢森堡先生脖子的刀，还不至于坏得锯不下你的脑袋！” 这个誓言极其可怕，路易十一一生只用圣洛的十字架发过两次誓。 奥里维张口结舌想回答：“王上……” “跪下！”国王狂怒地打断他道，“特里斯丹，守住这个人！” 奥里维跪下来，冷冰冰地说道：“王上，您的大理院法庭把一个女巫判了死刑，她躲在圣母院里，民众要用武力把她拉出来。总督先生和夜巡队队长是从叛乱地点来的，他们可以证明我讲的是不是实话。民众围攻的就是圣母院。” “果然！”国王气得脸发白，浑身发抖，他低声说道，“圣母啊，我善良的女主人！原来他们围攻的是您的大教堂啊！起来，奥里维，你说得有理，我要把西蒙·拉丹的职位赏给你。他们是攻击我呀，那个女巫是受教堂保护的，教堂是受我保护的。我还以为他们造法官的反呢，原来是造我的反呀！” 他好象被愤怒激动得年轻起来，大踏步走来走去。他不再笑了，脸色很可怕，走过来又走过去，狐狸变成了狼哪。他似乎窒息得说不出话了，只是嘴唇一动一动的，紧握着瘦骨嶙嶙的拳头。忽然他抬起头来，眼睛里充满了愤怒的光芒，声音同喇叭一般响亮：“砍碎他们，特里斯丹！把那些歹徒统统砍成碎块！去吧，我的朋友特里斯丹，给我杀吧，杀吧！” 发作了一阵，他又坐了下来，忍住怒火，不在乎地说：“在这里，特里斯丹，在我身边，在巴士底，有纪甫子爵的五十支长枪，一共三百匹马，你带去。还有沙多倍尔队长的一队近卫弓箭手，你带去。你是宪兵司令，你有你的人马，你可以全部带去。在圣波尔大厦，你还可以找到太子殿下的新卫队弓箭手四十名，你可以带去。带着这全部人马，快跑到圣母院去。啊，巴黎的平民先生们，你们想推翻法兰西的王冠，想推翻圣母院的神圣同这个国家的和平吗？斩尽杀绝！特里斯丹，把他们斩尽杀绝！不许让一个人逃脱，除非是逃到隼山去！” 特里斯丹躬身施礼：“好吧，王上。” 过一会他又问道：“我该把那个女巫怎么办呢？” 这个问题使国王沉吟起来。 “啊，”他说道，“女巫么！代斯杜特维尔先生，民众打算把她怎么办？” “王上，”巴黎总督答道，“我想民众是打算把她拖出圣母院的避难所，就是那个荡妇惹起了他们的恼怒。他们打算把她绞死。” 国王好象深思起来，随后他吩咐特里斯丹：“好吧，我的老弟，杀尽百姓，绞死女巫！” “妙啊，”居约姆向科勃诺尔耳语道，“命令惩罚老百姓，却又照老百姓的愿望行事！” “行了，王上，”特里斯丹答道，“要是那女巫还在圣母院里，是不是不管圣地不圣地的就把她拖出来呢？” “天晓得，什么圣地！”国王搔搔耳朵说，“总之得把那女巫绞死。” 说到这里，他好象想到了什么妙计似的，突然从椅子上滚到地下跪着，把帽子摘下来放在座位上，虔诚地望着帽子上的一个铅铸肖像。“啊，”他双手合十地说道， “巴黎的圣母，我崇敬的女护神啊！请宽恕我！我就只干这么一回。那个女犯应该受惩罚。圣处女啊，我善良的女主人，我向您担保，她是一个不值得受您怜惜的女巫。您知道，圣母啊，很多虔诚的君王都为了上帝的光荣和国家的需要，侵犯过教堂的特权。英格兰的主教圣雨格就曾经允许国王爱德华到他的教堂里去逮捕一个术士。法兰西的圣路易，我的老师，也曾经为了同样的目的侵犯了圣保尔先生的教堂。耶路撒冷国王的儿子阿尔封斯，甚至侵犯过圣塞比尔克尔教堂。请宽恕我这一回吧，巴黎的圣母啊，我决不再犯。我要献给您一个美丽的银像，就象我去年献给圣代苦依的圣母的那个一样。阿门！” 他划过十字便站起身来，重新戴上帽子，向特里斯丹说道：“勤奋些，我的老弟，让沙多倍尔先生同你一道，你们要把警钟敲响，你们要把民众击溃，你们要把女巫绞死。说定了！我等着听你奏功，你要向我报告一切。奥里维，今晚我不睡觉了，给我刮胡子。” 特里斯丹鞠躬告退。于是国王挥手和居约姆·韩和科勃诺尔告别：“上帝保佑你们，我的弗朗德勒好友们，请去休息一会。黑夜快结束哪，我们离天亮比离开黄昏近了。” 两人告辞退出。巴士底典狱长把他俩送回他们的房门口，科勃诺尔向居约姆·韩说：“这位咳咳咯咯的国王可叫我受够哪！我见过喝得酩酊大醉的查理·德·勃艮第，他还没有这个病歪歪的路易十一可恶呢。” “雅克先生，”韩回答道，“那是因为国王们的酒并不象他们的药水那么厉害。”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/264/2554.html","bookId":227,"book":{"id":227,"title":"巴黎圣母院 Notre-Dame de Paris","description":"简介：
