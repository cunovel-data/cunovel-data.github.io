{"id":6998,"no":30,"title":"Book 7 Chapter 1 The Danger Of Confiding One\u0027s Secret To A Go","content":"Many weeks had elapsed. The first of March had arrived. The sun, which Dubartas, that classic ancestor of periphrase, had not yet dubbed the \"Grand-duke of Candles,\" was none the less radiant and joyous on that account. It was one of those spring days which possesses so much sweetness and beauty, that all Paris turns out into the squares and promenades and celebrates them as though they were Sundays. In those days of brilliancy, warmth, and serenity, there is a certain hour above all others, when the fa?ade of Notre-Dame should be admired. It is the moment when the sun, already declining towards the west, looks the cathedral almost full in the face. Its rays, growing more and more horizontal, withdraw slowly from the pavement of the square, and mount up the perpendicular fa?ade, whose thousand bosses in high relief they cause to start out from the shadows, while the great central rose window flames like the eye of a cyclops, inflamed with the reflections of the forge. This was the hour. Opposite the lofty cathedral, reddened by the setting sun, on the stone balcony built above the porch of a rich Gothic house, which formed the angle of the square and the Rue du Parvis, several young girls were laughing and chatting with every sort of grace and mirth. From the length of the veil which fell from their pointed coif, twined with pearls, to their heels, from the fineness of the embroidered chemisette which covered their shoulders and allowed a glimpse, according to the pleasing custom of the time, of the swell of their fair virgin bosoms, from the opulence of their under-petticoats still more precious than their overdress (marvellous refinement), from the gauze, the silk, the velvet, with which all this was composed, and, above all, from the whiteness of their hands, which certified to their leisure and idleness, it was easy to divine they were noble and wealthy heiresses. They were, in fact, Damoiselle Fleur-de-Lys de Gondelaurier and her companions, Diane de Christeuil, Amelotte de Montmichel, Colombe de Gaillefontaine, and the little de Champchevrier maiden; all damsels of good birth, assembled at that moment at the house of the dame widow de Gondelaurier, on account of Monseigneur de Beaujeu and Madame his wife, who were to come to Paris in the month of April, there to choose maids of honor for the Dauphiness Marguerite, who was to be received in Picardy from the hands of the Flemings. Now, all the squires for twenty leagues around were intriguing for this favor for their daughters, and a goodly number of the latter had been already brought or sent to Paris. These four maidens had been confided to the discreet and venerable charge of Madame Aloise de Gondelaurier, widow of a former commander of the king\u0027s cross-bowmen, who had retired with her only daughter to her house in the Place du Parvis, Notre- Dame, in Paris. The balcony on which these young girls stood opened from a chamber richly tapestried in fawn-colored Flanders leather, stamped with golden foliage. The beams, which cut the ceiling in parallel lines, diverted the eye with a thousand eccentric painted and gilded carvings. Splendid enamels gleamed here and there on carved chests; a boar\u0027s head in faience crowned a magnificent dresser, whose two shelves announced that the mistress of the house was the wife or widow of a knight banneret. At the end of the room, by the side of a lofty chimney blazoned with arms from top to bottom, in a rich red velvet arm-chair, sat Dame de Gondelaurier, whose five and fifty years were written upon her garments no less distinctly than upon her face. Beside her stood a young man of imposing mien, although partaking somewhat of vanity and bravado--one of those handsome fellows whom all women agree to admire, although grave men learned in physiognomy shrug their shoulders at them. This young man wore the garb of a captain of the king\u0027s unattached archers, which bears far too much resemblance to the costume of Jupiter, which the reader has already been enabled to admire in the first book of this history, for us to inflict upon him a second description. The damoiselles were seated, a part in the chamber, a part in the balcony, some on square cushions of Utrecht velvet with golden corners, others on stools of oak carved in flowers and figures. Each of them held on her knee a section of a great needlework tapestry, on which they were working in company, while one end of it lay upon the rush mat which covered the floor. They were chatting together in that whispering tone and with the half-stifled laughs peculiar to an assembly of young girls in whose midst there is a young man. The young man whose presence served to set in play all these feminine self- conceits, appeared to pay very little heed to the matter, and, while these pretty damsels were vying with one another to attract his attention, he seemed to be chiefly absorbed in polishing the buckle of his sword belt with his doeskin glove. From time to time, the old lady addressed him in a very low tone, and he replied as well as he was able, with a sort of awkward and constrained politeness. From the smiles and significant gestures of Dame Aloise, from the glances which she threw towards her daughter, Fleur-de-Lys, as she spoke low to the captain, it was easy to see that there was here a question of some betrothal concluded, some marriage near at hand no doubt, between the young man and Fleur-de-Lys. From the embarrassed coldness of the officer, it was easy to see that on his side, at least, love had no longer any part in the matter. His whole air was expressive of constraint and weariness, which our lieutenants of the garrison would to-day translate admirably as, \"What a beastly bore!\" The poor dame, very much infatuated with her daughter, like any other silly mother, did not perceive the officer\u0027s lack of enthusiasm, and strove in low tones to call his attention to the infinite grace with which Fleur-de-Lys used her needle or wound her skein. \"Come, little cousin,\" she said to him, plucking him by the sleeve, in order to speak in his ear, \"Look at her, do! see her stoop.\" \"Yes, truly,\" replied the young man, and fell back into his glacial and absent-minded silence. A moment later, he was obliged to bend down again, and Dame Aloise said to him,-- \"Have you ever beheld a more gay and charming face than that of your betrothed? Can one be more white and blonde? are not her hands perfect? and that neck--does it not assume all the curves of the swan in ravishing fashion? How I envy you at times! and how happy you are to be a man, naughty libertine that you are! Is not my Fleur-de-Lys adorably beautiful, and are you not desperately in love with her?\" \"Of course,\" he replied, still thinking of something else. \"But do say something,\" said Madame Aloise, suddenly giving his shoulder a push; \"you have grown very timid.\" We can assure our readers that timidity was neither the captain\u0027s virtue nor his defect. But he made an effort to do what was demanded of him. \"Fair cousin,\" he said, approaching Fleur-de-Lys, \"what is the subject of this tapestry work which you are fashioning?\u0027 \"Fair cousin,\" responded Fleur-de-Lys, in an offended tone, \"I have already told you three times. \u0027Tis the grotto of Neptune.\" It was evident that Fleur-de-Lys saw much more clearly than her mother through the captain\u0027s cold and absent-minded manner. He felt the necessity of making some conversation. \"And for whom is this Neptunerie destined?\" \"For the Abbey of Saint-Antoine des Champs,\" answered Fleur-de-Lys, without raising her eyes. The captain took up a corner of the tapestry. \"Who, my fair cousin, is this big gendarme, who is puffing out his cheeks to their full extent and blowing a trumpet?\" \"\u0027Tis Triton,\" she replied. There was a rather pettish intonation in Fleur-de-Lys\u0027s-- laconic words. The young man understood that it was indispensable that he should whisper something in her ear, a commonplace, a gallant compliment, no matter what. Accordingly he bent down, but he could find nothing in his imagination more tender and personal than this,-- \"Why does your mother always wear that surcoat with armorial designs, like our grandmothers of the time of Charles VII.? Tell her, fair cousin, that \u0027tis no longer the fashion, and that the hinge (gond) and the laurel (laurier) embroidered on her robe give her the air of a walking mantlepiece. In truth, people no longer sit thus on their banners, I assure you.\" Fleur-de-Lys raised her beautiful eyes, full of reproach, \"Is that all of which you can assure me?\" she said, in a low voice. In the meantime, Dame Aloise, delighted to see them thus bending towards each other and whispering, said as she toyed with the clasps of her prayer-book,-- \"Touching picture of love!\" The captain, more and more embarrassed, fell back upon the subject of the tapestry,--\"\u0027Tis, in sooth, a charming work!\" he exclaimed. Whereupon Colombe de Gaillefontaine, another beautiful blonde, with a white skin, dressed to the neck in blue damask, ventured a timid remark which she addressed to Fleur-de-Lys, in the hope that the handsome captain would reply to it, \"My dear Gondelaurier, have you seen the tapestries of the H?tel de la Roche-Guyon?\" \"Is not that the hotel in which is enclosed the garden of the Lingère du Louvre?\" asked Diane de Christeuil with a laugh; for she had handsome teeth, and consequently laughed on every occasion. \"And where there is that big, old tower of the ancient wall of Paris,\" added Amelotte de Montmichel, a pretty fresh and curly-headed brunette, who had a habit of sighing just as the other laughed, without knowing why. \"My dear Colombe,\" interpolated Dame Aloise, \"do you not mean the hotel which belonged to Monsieur de Bacqueville, in the reign of King Charles VI.? there are indeed many superb high warp tapestries there.\" \"Charles VI.! Charles VI.!\" muttered the young captain, twirling his moustache. \"Good heavens! what old things the good dame does remember!\" Madame de Gondelaurier continued, \"Fine tapestries, in truth. A work so esteemed that it passes as unrivalled.\" At that moment Bérangère de Champchevrier, a slender little maid of seven years, who was peering into the square through the trefoils of the balcony, exclaimed, \"Oh! look, fair Godmother Fleur-de-Lys, at that pretty dancer who is dancing on the pavement and playing the tambourine in the midst of the loutish bourgeois!\" The sonorous vibration of a tambourine was, in fact, audible. \"Some gypsy from Bohemia,\" said Fleur-de-Lys, turning carelessly toward the square. \"Look! look!\" exclaimed her lively companions; and they all ran to the edge of the balcony, while Fleur-de-Lys, rendered thoughtful by the coldness of her betrothed, followed them slowly, and the latter, relieved by this incident, which put an end to an embarrassing conversation, retreated to the farther end of the room, with the satisfied air of a soldier released from duty. Nevertheless, the fair Fleur-de-Lys\u0027s was a charming and noble service, and such it had formerly appeared to him; but the captain had gradually become blase\u0027; the prospect of a speedy marriage cooled him more every day. Moreover, he was of a fickle disposition, and, must we say it, rather vulgar in taste. Although of very noble birth, he had contracted in his official harness more than one habit of the common trooper. The tavern and its accompaniments pleased him. He was only at his ease amid gross language, military gallantries, facile beauties, and successes yet more easy. He had, nevertheless, received from his family some education and some politeness of manner; but he had been thrown on the world too young, he had been in garrison at too early an age, and every day the polish of a gentleman became more and more effaced by the rough friction of his gendarme\u0027s cross-belt. While still continuing to visit her from time to time, from a remnant of common respect, he felt doubly embarrassed with Fleur-de-Lys; in the first place, because, in consequence of having scattered his love in all sorts of places, he had reserved very little for her; in the next place, because, amid so many stiff, formal, and decent ladies, he was in constant fear lest his mouth, habituated to oaths, should suddenly take the bit in its teeth, and break out into the language of the tavern. The effect can be imagined! Moreover, all this was mingled in him, with great pretentions to elegance, toilet, and a fine appearance. Let the reader reconcile these things as best he can. I am simply the historian. He had remained, therefore, for several minutes, leaning in silence against the carved jamb of the chimney, and thinking or not thinking, when Fleur-de-Lys suddenly turned and addressed him. After all, the poor young girl was pouting against the dictates of her heart. \"Fair cousin, did you not speak to us of a little Bohemian whom you saved a couple of months ago, while making the patrol with the watch at night, from the hands of a dozen robbers?\" \"I believe so, fair cousin,.\" said the captain. \"Well,\" she resumed, \"perchance \u0027tis that same gypsy girl who is dancing yonder, on the church square. Come and see if you recognize her, fair Cousin Phoebus.\" A secret desire for reconciliation was apparent in this gentle invitation which she gave him to approach her, and in the care which she took to call him by name. Captain Phoebus de Chateaupers (for it is he whom the reader has had before his eyes since the beginning of this chapter) slowly approached the balcony. \"Stay,\" said Fleur-de-Lys, laying her hand tenderly on Phoebus\u0027s arm; \"look at that little girl yonder, dancing in that circle. Is she your Bohemian?\" Phoebus looked, and said,-- \"Yes, I recognize her by her goat.\" \"Oh! in fact, what a pretty little goat!\" said Amelotte, clasping her hands in admiration. \"Are his horns of real gold?\" inquired Bérangère. Without moving from her arm-chair, Dame Aloise interposed, \"Is she not one of those gypsy girls who arrived last year by the Gibard gate?\" \"Madame my mother,\" said Fleur-de-Lys gently, \"that gate is now called the Porte d\u0027Enfer.\" Mademoiselle de Gondelaurier knew how her mother\u0027s antiquated mode of speech shocked the captain. In fact, he began to sneer, and muttered between his teeth: \"Porte Gibard! Porte Gibard! \u0027Tis enough to make King Charles VI. pass by.\" \"Godmother!\" exclaimed Bérangère, whose eyes, incessantly in motion, had suddenly been raised to the summit of the towers of Notre-Dame, \"who is that black man up yonder?\" All the young girls raised their eyes. A man was, in truth, leaning on the balustrade which surmounted the northern tower, looking on the Grève. He was a priest. His costume could be plainly discerned, and his face resting on both his hands. But he stirred no more than if he had been a statue. His eyes, intently fixed, gazed into the Place. It was something like the immobility of a bird of prey, who has just discovered a nest of sparrows, and is gazing at it. \"\u0027Tis monsieur the archdeacon of Josas,\" said Fleur-de-Lys. \"You have good eyes if you can recognize him from here,\" said the Gaillefontaine. \"How he is staring at the little dancer!\" went on Diane de Christeuil. \"Let the gypsy beware!\" said Fleur-de-Lys, \"for he loves not Egypt.\" \"\u0027Tis a great shame for that man to look upon her thus,\" added Amelotte de Montmichel, \"for she dances delightfully.\" \"Fair cousin Phoebus,\" said Fleur-de-Lys suddenly, \"Since you know this little gypsy, make her a sign to come up here. It will amuse us.\" \"Oh, yes!\" exclaimed all the young girls, clapping their hands. \"Why! \u0027tis not worth while,\" replied Phoebus. \"She has forgotten me, no doubt, and I know not so much as her name. Nevertheless, as you wish it, young ladies, I will make the trial.\" And leaning over the balustrade of the balcony, he began to shout, \"Little one!\" The dancer was not beating her tambourine at the moment. She turned her head towards the point whence this call proceeded, her brilliant eyes rested on Phoebus, and she stopped short. \"Little one!\" repeated the captain; and he beckoned her to approach. The young girl looked at him again, then she blushed as though a flame had mounted into her cheeks, and, taking her tambourine under her arm, she made her way through the astonished spectators towards the door of the house where Phoebus was calling her, with slow, tottering steps, and with the troubled look of a bird which is yielding to the fascination of a serpent. A moment later, the tapestry portière was raised, and the gypsy appeared on the threshold of the chamber, blushing, confused, breathless, her large eyes drooping, and not daring to advance another step. Bérangère clapped her hands. Meanwhile, the dancer remained motionless upon the threshold. Her appearance had produced a singular effect upon these young girls. It is certain that a vague and indistinct desire to please the handsome officer animated them all, that his splendid uniform was the target of all their coquetries, and that from the moment he presented himself, there existed among them a secret, suppressed rivalry, which they hardly acknowledged even to themselves, but which broke forth, none the less, every instant, in their gestures and remarks. Nevertheless, as they were all very nearly equal in beauty, they contended with equal arms, and each could hope for the victory.--The arrival of the gypsy suddenly destroyed this equilibrium. Her beauty was so rare, that, at the moment when she appeared at the entrance of the apartment, it seemed as though she diffused a sort of light which was peculiar to herself. In that narrow chamber, surrounded by that sombre frame of hangings and woodwork, she was incomparably more beautiful and more radiant than on the public square. She was like a torch which has suddenly been brought from broad daylight into the dark. The noble damsels were dazzled by her in spite of themselves. Each one felt herself, in some sort, wounded in her beauty. Hence, their battle front (may we be allowed the expression,) was immediately altered, although they exchanged not a single word. But they understood each other perfectly. Women\u0027s instincts comprehend and respond to each other more quickly than the intelligences of men. An enemy had just arrived; all felt it--all rallied together. One drop of wine is sufficient to tinge a glass of water red; to diffuse a certain degree of ill temper throughout a whole assembly of pretty women, the arrival of a prettier woman suffices, especially when there is but one man present. Hence the welcome accorded to the gypsy was marvellously glacial. They surveyed her from head to foot, then exchanged glances, and all was said; they understood each other. Meanwhile, the young girl was waiting to be spoken to, in such emotion that she dared not raise her eyelids. The captain was the first to break the silence. \"Upon my word,\" said he, in his tone of intrepid fatuity, \"here is a charming creature! What think you of her, fair cousin?\" This remark, which a more delicate admirer would have uttered in a lower tone, at least was not of a nature to dissipate the feminine jealousies which were on the alert before the gypsy. Fleur-de-Lys replied to the captain with a bland affectation of disdain;--\"Not bad.\" The others whispered. At length, Madame Aloise, who was not the less jealous because she was so for her daughter, addressed the dancer,--\"Approach, little one.\" \"Approach, little one!\" repeated, with comical dignity, little Bérangère, who would have reached about as high as her hips. The gypsy advanced towards the noble dame. \"Fair child,\" said Phoebus, with emphasis, taking several steps towards her, \"I do not know whether I have the supreme honor of being recognized by you.\" She interrupted him, with a smile and a look full of infinite sweetness,-- \"Oh! yes,\" said she. \"She has a good memory,\" remarked Fleur-de-Lys. \"Come, now,\" resumed Phoebus, \"you escaped nimbly the other evening. Did I frighten you!\" \"Oh! no,\" said the gypsy. There was in the intonation of that \"Oh! no,\" uttered after that \"Oh! yes,\" an ineffable something which wounded Fleur-de-Lys. \"You left me in your stead, my beauty,\" pursued the captain, whose tongue was unloosed when speaking to a girl out of the street, \"a crabbed knave, one-eyed and hunchbacked, the bishop\u0027s bellringer, I believe. I have been told that by birth he is the bastard of an archdeacon and a devil. He has a pleasant name: he is called ~Quatre-Temps~ (Ember Days), ~Paques-Fleuries~ (Palm Sunday), Mardi-Gras (Shrove Tuesday), I know not what! The name of some festival when the bells are pealed! So he took the liberty of carrying you off, as though you were made for beadles! \u0027Tis too much. What the devil did that screech-owl want with you? Hey, tell me!\" \"I do not know,\" she replied. \"The inconceivable impudence! A bellringer carrying off a wench, like a vicomte! a lout poaching on the game of gentlemen! that is a rare piece of assurance. However, he paid dearly for it. Master Pierrat Torterue is the harshest groom that ever curried a knave; and I can tell you, if it will be agreeable to you, that your bellringer\u0027s hide got a thorough dressing at his hands.\" \"Poor man!\" said the gypsy, in whom these words revived the memory of the pillory. The captain burst out laughing. \"Corne-de-boeuf! here\u0027s pity as well placed as a feather in a pig\u0027s tail! May I have as big a belly as a pope, if--\" He stopped short. \"Pardon me, ladies; I believe that I was on the point of saying something foolish.\" \"Fie, sir\" said la Gaillefontaine. \"He talks to that creature in her own tongue!\" added Fleur-de-Lys, in a low tone, her irritation increasing every moment. This irritation was not diminished when she beheld the captain, enchanted with the gypsy, and, most of all, with himself, execute a pirouette on his heel, repeating with coarse, na?ve, and soldierly gallantry,-- \"A handsome wench, upon my soul!\" \"Rather savagely dressed,\" said Diane de Christeuil, laughing to show her fine teeth. This remark was a flash of light to the others. Not being able to impugn her beauty, they attacked her costume. \"That is true,\" said la Montmichel; \"what makes you run about the streets thus, without guimpe or ruff?\" \"That petticoat is so short that it makes one tremble,\" added la Gaillefontaine. \"My dear,\" continued Fleur-de-Lys, with decided sharpness, \"You will get yourself taken up by the sumptuary police for your gilded girdle.\" \"Little one, little one;\" resumed la Christeuil, with an implacable smile, \"if you were to put respectable sleeves upon your arms they would get less sunburned.\" It was, in truth, a spectacle worthy of a more intelligent spectator than Phoebus, to see how these beautiful maidens, with their envenomed and angry tongues, wound, serpent-like, and glided and writhed around the street dancer. They were cruel and graceful; they searched and rummaged maliciously in her poor and silly toilet of spangles and tinsel. There was no end to their laughter, irony, and humiliation. Sarcasms rained down upon the gypsy, and haughty condescension and malevolent looks. One would have thought they were young Roman dames thrusting golden pins into the breast of a beautiful slave. One would have pronounced them elegant grayhounds, circling, with inflated nostrils, round a poor woodland fawn, whom the glance of their master forbade them to devour. After all, what was a miserable dancer on the public squares in the presence of these high-born maidens? They seemed to take no heed of her presence, and talked of her aloud, to her face, as of something unclean, abject, and yet, at the same time, passably pretty. The gypsy was not insensible to these pin-pricks. From time to time a flush of shame, a flash of anger inflamed her eyes or her cheeks; with disdain she made that little grimace with which the reader is already familiar, but she remained motionless; she fixed on Phoebus a sad, sweet, resigned look. There was also happiness and tenderness in that gaze. One would have said that she endured for fear of being expelled. Phoebus laughed, and took the gypsy\u0027s part with a mixture of impertinence and pity. \"Let them talk, little one!\" he repeated, jingling his golden spurs. \"No doubt your toilet is a little extravagant and wild, but what difference does that make with such a charming damsel as yourself?\" \"Good gracious!\" exclaimed the blonde Gaillefontaine, drawing up her swan-like throat, with a bitter smile. \"I see that messieurs the archers of the king\u0027s police easily take fire at the handsome eyes of gypsies!\" \"Why not?\" said Phoebus. At this reply uttered carelessly by the captain, like a stray stone, whose fall one does not even watch, Colombe began to laugh, as well as Diane, Amelotte, and Fleur-de-Lys, into whose eyes at the same time a tear started. The gypsy, who had dropped her eyes on the floor at the words of Colombe de Gaillefontaine, raised them beaming with joy and pride and fixed them once more on Phoebus. She was very beautiful at that moment. The old dame, who was watching this scene, felt offended, without understanding why. \"Holy Virgin!\" she suddenly exclaimed, \"what is it moving about my legs? Ah! the villanous beast!\" It was the goat, who had just arrived, in search of his mistress, and who, in dashing towards the latter, had begun by entangling his horns in the pile of stuffs which the noble dame\u0027s garments heaped up on her feet when she was seated. This created a diversion. The gypsy disentangled his horns without uttering a word. \"Oh! here\u0027s the little goat with golden hoofs!\" exclaimed Bérangère, dancing with joy. The gypsy crouched down on her knees and leaned her cheek against the fondling head of the goat. One would have said that she was asking pardon for having quitted it thus. Meanwhile, Diane had bent down to Colombe\u0027s ear. \"Ah! good heavens! why did not I think of that sooner? \u0027Tis the gypsy with the goat. They say she is a sorceress, and that her goat executes very miraculous tricks.\" \"Well!\" said Colombe, \"the goat must now amuse us in its turn, and perform a miracle for us.\" Diane and Colombe eagerly addressed the gypsy. \"Little one, make your goat perform a miracle.\" \"I do not know what you mean,\" replied the dancer. \"A miracle, a piece of magic, a bit of sorcery, in short.\" \"I do not understand.\" And she fell to caressing the pretty animal, repeating, \"Djali! Djali!\" At that moment Fleur-de-Lys noticed a little bag of embroidered leather suspended from the neck of the goat,-- \"What is that?\" she asked of the gypsy. The gypsy raised her large eyes upon her and replied gravely,-- \"That is my secret.\" \"I should really like to know what your secret is,\" thought Fleur-de-Lys. Meanwhile, the good dame had risen angrily,--\" Come now, gypsy, if neither you nor your goat can dance for us, what are you doing here?\" The gypsy walked slowly towards the door, without making any reply. But the nearer she approached it, the more her pace slackened. An irresistible magnet seemed to hold her. Suddenly she turned her eyes, wet with tears, towards Phoebus, and halted. \"True God!\" exclaimed the captain, \"that\u0027s not the way to depart. Come back and dance something for us. By the way, my sweet love, what is your name?\" \"La Esmeralda,\" said the dancer, never taking her eyes from him. At this strange name, a burst of wild laughter broke from the young girls. \"Here\u0027s a terrible name for a young lady,\" said Diane. \"You see well enough,\" retorted Amelotte, \"that she is an enchantress.\" \"My dear,\" exclaimed Dame Aloise solemnly, \"your parents did not commit the sin of giving you that name at the baptismal font.\" In the meantime, several minutes previously, Bérangère had coaxed the goat into a corner of the room with a marchpane cake, without any one having noticed her. In an instant they had become good friends. The curious child had detached the bag from the goat\u0027s neck, had opened it, and had emptied out its contents on the rush matting; it was an alphabet, each letter of which was separately inscribed on a tiny block of boxwood. Hardly had these playthings been spread out on the matting, when the child, with surprise, beheld the goat (one of whose \"miracles\" this was no doubt), draw out certain letters with its golden hoof, and arrange them, with gentle pushes, in a certain order. In a moment they constituted a word, which the goat seemed to have been trained to write, so little hesitation did it show in forming it, and Bérangère suddenly exclaimed, clasping her hands in admiration,-- \"Godmother Fleur-de-Lys, see what the goat has just done!\" Fleur-de-Lys ran up and trembled. The letters arranged upon the floor formed this word,-- PHOEBUS. \"Was it the goat who wrote that?\" she inquired in a changed voice. \"Yes, godmother,\" replied Bérangêre. It was impossible to doubt it; the child did not know how to write. \"This is the secret!\" thought Fleur-de-Lys. Meanwhile, at the child\u0027s exclamation, all had hastened up, the mother, the young girls, the gypsy, and the officer. The gypsy beheld the piece of folly which the goat had committed. She turned red, then pale, and began to tremble like a culprit before the captain, who gazed at her with a smile of satisfaction and amazement. \"Phoebus!\" whispered the young girls, stupefied: \"\u0027tis the captain\u0027s name!\" \"You have a marvellous memory!\" said Fleur-de-Lys, to the petrified gypsy. Then, bursting into sobs: \"Oh!\" she stammered mournfully, hiding her face in both her beautiful hands, \"she is a magician!\" And she heard another and a still more bitter voice at the bottom of her heart, saying,-- \"She is a rival!\" She fell fainting. \"My daughter! my daughter!\" cried the terrified mother. \"Begone, you gypsy of hell!\" In a twinkling, La Esmeralda gathered up the unlucky letters, made a sign to Djali, and went out through one door, while Fleur-de-Lys was being carried out through the other. Captain Phoebus, on being left alone, hesitated for a moment between the two doors, then he followed the gypsy. 几个星期过去了。 正是三月初。那时候，古典修辞学之祖杜巴尔达斯还没有把太阳叫做“蜡烛里的大公爵”，但太阳还是同样光明灿烂。那是春季里的一天，是那种美妙甜蜜的日子，全巴黎的人都跑到广场和大街上的那种日子，例如节日或星期日。在那种光明、热烈、庄严的日子里，总有某个时辰是规定可以瞻仰圣母院大门廊的，那是正当向西斜落的太阳把余晖直射着那座大教堂前墙的时候。那时的夕阳愈来愈斜，慢慢离开了广场地面，沿着教堂前墙的尖顶上升，使一切浮雕都从阴影中突现，同时正中的巨大圆形雕花窗就象是塞克罗平的独眼，反射出炼铁炉里的红光。 现在正是那种时候。 在被夕阳照红了的巍峨的大教堂的对面，在形成巴尔维街和巴尔维广场拐角的那座富丽的哥特式宅第的门廊顶上，有一座石头的阳台，有几个漂亮姑娘在阳台上欢乐地谈笑和嬉戏。从她们缀满珍珠的尖帽子上挂下来直拖到脚跟的长长的面纱，从那盖着她们双肩的照当时风尚略为袒露出处女胸脯的绣花胸衣，从她们裙子上的褶子，从她们披在华丽的（华丽得出奇的）衣服外面的小外套，从她们装饰在衣服上的棉纱、丝绸和天鹅绒，尤其是从她们的显然没有做过苦工的雪白的手，你便猜想得到她们是属于高贵富有的家庭。她们是孚勒尔·德·丽丝·贡德洛里耶小姐和她的朋友们：狄安娜·德·克利斯丹依，阿默洛特·德·蒙米歇尔，高兰布·德·加耶枫丹和年幼的德·尚谢勿西耶。她们都是好人家的孩子，当时都聚在贡德洛里耶寡妇家里，等候波热殿下和波热夫人，他们将在四月份来到巴黎，为玛格丽特公主挑选几个贵族小姐作傧相，然后到庇卡底弗朗德勒使臣那里去迎接公主。三十里内的上等人家都盼望自家的女儿能得到这份荣幸，其中有好些人已经把女儿带到或送到巴黎来，托付在阿洛伊思·德·贡德洛里耶夫人严谨而令人敬佩的管束之下。她是前王室弓箭队军官的寡妇，她和她的女儿居住在巴黎巴尔维广场她自己的房子里。 这些姑娘所在的那个阳台，紧连着一个挂满黄地金条纹的华丽帏幔的房间，大天花板上那些平行的灿烂的横梁上，有成千种奇特的描金涂色雕刻，望上去很愉快。几个有雕饰的衣架上，到处挂着华丽的铠甲，一个彩陶野猪头放在一个大食橱顶上，食橱是双层的，表示这房子的主妇是一个方旗骑士的妻子或遗孀。在房间尽头一个从上到下刻满盾牌和勋章的高大壁炉旁边，有一把红色天鹅绒安乐椅，上面坐着贡德洛里耶夫人。从她的面貌和装束上都看得出她有五十五岁左右，她旁边直挺挺地站着一个神色相当骄傲的青年，虽然有点轻浮虚伪，却仍然是那种女人们一见就会倾心，而严肃的男人和星相家一见就会耸肩膀的美男子。这青年骑士穿着近卫弓箭队长金碧辉煌的服装，很象本书第一卷里那个朱比特的装束，我们就不必再来描绘一遍了。 小姐们全都坐着，有的坐在房间里，有的坐在阳台上，有的坐在金色镶边的乌德勒支天鹅绒坐垫上，有的坐在雕刻着人物花卉的橡木凳子上。她们正在一起绣着花的那幅很大的绣花帏幔，一半铺展在她们的膝头，另一头拖在盖住地板的草席上。 当一个青年男子在场时，她们就用那种悄悄的声音和抑制的轻笑交谈着，这个青年男子的在场足以刺激那全体多情的女性的自尊心，他本人却仿佛并不怎样在意。那几位漂亮姑娘都争着想引起他的注意，但他自己好象特别忙于用麂皮手套去擦他皮带上的钮扣。 那个老太太间或低声同他讲几句话，他尽量呆板地勉强地回答着。从阿洛伊思夫人低声同那个队长讲话时的微笑和她的聪明的小手势，从她一面向女儿孚勒尔·德· 丽丝挤眉弄眼的情形看来，很容易猜出他们之间有姻戚关系，很容易看出那个青年与孚勒尔·德·丽丝一定是有了婚约的。但从那青年冷淡和不耐烦的表情，很容易看出至少在他那方面根本没有什么爱情，他是满脸的厌烦和疲倦。如今我们卫戍队里的少尉们准会把这种情形出色地解释为他心里在骂：“只配打扫的娼妇！” 那位好夫人，那很为女儿骄傲的可怜的母亲，并没看出青年军官毫不热心的样子，还竭力怂恿他注意孚勒尔·德·丽丝正在一针一线地绣着未完工的帏幔。 “啊，好侄儿，”她拉着他的衣袖，附在他耳边低声说道，“你瞧她低着头的样儿！” “是呀，”青年回答了一声，随后还是象先前那样沉默冷淡。 过了一会，他又不得不弯下腰来听阿洛伊思夫人的问话：“你看见过比你的未婚妻更标致更可爱的姑娘吗？谁能有比她更白的皮肤和更好的金褐色头发呢？她的手不是十分完美吗？她的脖子不是象天鹅的脖子一般美妙吗？ 我祝贺你！你这放浪的家伙，你当了男人多么幸福！我的孚勒尔·德·丽丝不是漂亮得令人崇拜吗？你不是被她迷住了吗？” “当然啦！”他答道，心里却在想别的事。 “可是去同她说说话呀，”阿洛伊思夫人忽然推着他的肩膀说道，“去同她谈点什么，你变得够胆小的哪。” 我们敢向读者担保胆小并不是那个队长的毛病，也不是那个队长的优点，但他还是尝试着照别人的意思行事。 “好表妹，”他走到孚勒尔·德·丽丝身边说，“这幅帏幔上绣的是什么呀？” “好表哥，”孚勒尔·德·丽丝用轻蔑的声调答道，“我已经告诉过你三遍了：这是海神的洞府。” 青年队长那种冷淡和不在意的样子，孚勒尔·德·丽丝显然比她母亲看得清楚多了。他感到必须要交谈一番。 “这海神洞府的帏幔是替谁绣的呢？” “替郊区圣安东尼寺院绣的，”孚勒尔·德·丽丝答道，连眼皮也没有抬一下。 青年队长拿起帏幔一角说：“我的好表妹，这个鼓着两腮吹海螺的胖武士是谁呀？” “那是特西多。” 孚勒尔·德·丽丝的简短的答话，依然显出她还在生气。那个青年男子知道自己必须附在她耳边讲讲话，讲几句无聊的恭维人的话，于是他弯下腰去，但他再也想不出比下面这句话更温柔更亲密的了：“你母亲为什么老是穿这种我们的祖母在查理七世时代就穿的绣纹章的短外衣呢？”他说道，“好表妹，这种短外衣现在已经不流行了，她衣服上绣的铰链形和桂花形纹章，使她好象活动的火炉架子。我敢担保，人们现在真的再不打这种旗号了。” 孚勒尔·德·丽丝抬起漂亮的眼睛责怪地看了他一眼，“你要向我担保 的事就是这个吗？”她低声问道。 那好心肠的阿洛伊思夫人看见他俩这样靠近地低声谈话，觉得非常开心，便拍着她的祈祷书高兴地说：“多么动人的谈情说爱的场面呀！” 青年队长愈来愈不好意思了，便朝着那幅帏幔改口说：“这真是一件漂亮的手工！”他大声嚷道。 听到这句赞赏的话，另一个姑娘高兰布·德·加耶枫丹，她身穿蓝缎衣服，皮肤白皙，有一头漂亮金发，便怯生生地问孚勒尔·德·丽丝（同时却希望那漂亮青年来回答）：“亲爱的贡德洛里耶，你看见过罗歇·居容大厦的帏幔吗？” “是不是卢浮宫里林日尔花园旁边的那座大厦？”狄安娜·德·克利斯丹依微笑着问道，她牙齿很美，因此她老是在笑。 “那里有巴黎古代城墙上高大的望楼，”皮色浅褐、两颊鲜红、头发乌黑鬈曲的迷人的阿默洛特附和道，她是惯于在别人笑的时候莫名其妙地叹气的。 “我亲爱的高兰布，”阿洛伊思夫人又说，“你说的是国王查理六世时候的巴格维勒先生的府邸吗？那里有些上等质料的绝妙的帏幔。” “查理六世！国王查理六世！”那青年队长摸着小胡子抱怨道，“天哪！ 这位好夫人记得多么清楚那些古老的东西！” 贡德洛里耶夫人接着又说：“的确是漂亮的帏幔呀！那手工的确是令人惊叹的！” 正靠在阳台栏杆上望着广场的瘦弱的七岁小姑娘倍韩日尔·德·尚谢勿西耶这时忽然喊道：“看呀，孚勒尔·德·丽丝教母！那漂亮的跳舞姑娘又在石板路上敲着鼓跳舞啦，就在那边的平民堆里！” 人们的确听见了一面手鼓的响亮的声音。 “是个流浪的埃及姑娘，”孚勒尔·德·丽丝懒洋洋地回过头去望着广场说。 “咱们看去！咱们看去！”她那些活泼的女伴们嚷着，全都跑到阳台边去了，孚勒尔·德·丽丝心里想着未婚夫对她的冷淡，慢吞吞地跟在她们后面，那未婚夫却因为这件突如其来的事打断了那恼人的谈话，倒觉得挺高兴，便带着完成了任务的军人的满足心情回到房间尽头。侍候漂亮的孚勒尔·德·丽丝，在往日对于这个青年队长来说本来是件愉快而容易完成的任务，但他已逐渐厌烦了，看见婚期日益临近，他就一天比一天更加冷淡。他是没有恒心的，而且——还用说吗？——趣味有点低级，虽然他出身高贵，可是已经染上了不止一种的老兵的习气。他喜欢酒店，经常在里面混，他只有同那些讲粗话的人在一起时，只有同豪爽的军人在一起时，只有在容易得来的美色和容易得来的成功当中，才会觉得方便和自在。虽然他曾经在自己家里受到教育，学习礼貌，但是他非常年轻时就已经跑遍全国，非常年轻时就被送进了军队，而他那上等人的光泽，逐渐被武士服的肩带磨去了。在他由于礼貌关系随时进行的一些拜访中，要算在孚勒尔·德·丽丝家中这一次使他加倍觉得难为情了。首先因为他到处浪费爱情，他并没有给孚勒尔·德·丽丝留下多少，其次是因为在那么多有教养的又文雅又羞怯的姑娘中间，他老在担心他那说惯了粗话的嘴忽然发疯，溜出一句酒店里的话来。请想想那种情景该多么精彩吧！ 何况，这一切又和他因自己有着俊美的容貌和考究的服装而感到的骄傲搅混在一起，你们爱怎么想象便怎么想象吧，我只不过是一个讲故事的人罢了。 他好一会没有说话，在那儿想事或是什么都没想，当孚勒尔·德·丽丝忽然转身向他讲话时，他正默默地靠在雕花的壁炉上。总之，使那可怜的姑娘生气的不过是他那有戒备的心罢了。 “好表哥，你不是告诉过我，说你在两个月前某个晚上巡夜的时候，从一打强盗手里救出了一个波希米亚小姑娘吗？” “我想是的，好表妹。”队长说。 “好吧，”她说道，“可能就是这个在巴尔维广场上跳舞的流浪姑娘吧。 过来看看你认识她不，弗比斯表哥。” 她唤着他的名字叫他到身边来的这个邀请，暗中含有表示和解的意思，弗比斯·德·沙多倍尔队长（读者从这一章开头就看得出是他）拖着缓慢的脚步向阳台走去。“看呀，”孚勒尔·德·丽丝温柔地把手扶着弗比斯的胳膊说，“看那边人堆里跳舞的小姑娘，她就是你的那个流浪姑娘吧？” “是她，我看见她的羊儿就认出来了。” “啊，真是漂亮的小羊呀！”阿默洛特赞美地合着手说。 “它那两只犄角真是金的吗？”倍韩日尔问道。 在她的安乐椅上纹丝不动的阿洛伊思夫人说话了：“是不是去年从吉巴尔门进城的那些波希米亚人里面的一个？” “我的母亲大人，那道城门如今叫做地狱门了。”孚勒尔·德·丽丝轻声说。 贡德洛里耶小姐知道青年队长对于她母亲那种谈论老古董的话厌烦到什么程度。真的，他已经在咬牙切齿地冷笑了：“吉巴尔门！吉巴尔门！那是因为她想起了国王查理六世哟！” “教母！”倍韩日尔滴溜溜的眼睛不停地转动着，忽然抬起来望着圣母院的塔顶说：“上面那个穿黑衣服的男人是谁呀？” 姑娘们全都抬起眼睛，的确有个男子倚在靠北边的朝向格雷沃广场的那座钟塔的栏杆上，那是一个神甫，看得清他的衣服和用双手支着的脸孔。他象一尊塑像似的纹丝不动，呆定的目光望着广场。 那是鹞鹰注视它刚刚发现的鸟窠时的那种目光。 “那是若扎斯的副主教先生。”孚勒尔·德·丽丝说。 “这么远你都认出了他，可见你的眼力真好！”加耶枫丹说。 “他好象是在看那跳舞的姑娘呢！”狄安娜·德·克利斯丹依说道。 “那埃及姑娘可要当心才好，”孚勒尔·德·丽丝说，“他是不喜欢埃及人的。” “真遗憾那个人这样看着她，她跳舞跳得好极啦！”阿默洛特·德·蒙米歇尔说。 “好表哥弗比斯，”孚勒尔·德·丽丝忽然说道，“你既然认识这个流浪的小姑娘，你就做个手势叫她上来吧。那样会使我们高兴的。” “啊，就这样！”姑娘们都拍着手嚷道。 “但这是件傻事呀！”弗比斯答道，“她一定早就把我忘了，何况我连她的名字都不知道。但是小姐们，既然你们愿意，我就试试看。”他说着就走到阳台栏杆边上喊道：“小姑娘！” 跳舞的姑娘那时正巧没有敲鼓，听见有人喊她，就朝着喊声的方向转过头来，亮晶晶的眼光落到弗比斯身上，突然停住不跳舞了。 “小姑娘！”队长又喊了一声，并且招手叫她来。 姑娘依旧望着他，随后双颊象着了火一般涨得绯红，她把小鼓夹在腋下，穿过惊讶的人群，向弗比斯呼唤她的那座房子的大门走去，脚步缓慢而摇晃，眼光困惑得好象一只无法逃避蛇的引诱的鸟儿。 过了一会儿，帏幔被撩开了。流浪姑娘红着脸，喘着气，慌张地出现在门槛边，两只大眼睛望着地板，不敢再向前迈步。 倍韩日尔拍起手来。 跳舞姑娘仍然一动不动地呆在门槛边，她的出现在这群姑娘里产生了奇特的影响。她们一定或多或少地同时被一个想取悦那漂亮军官的模糊不清的愿望激动着，那精致的制服成了她们全体卖弄风情的目标，自从他在场，她们之间就产生了某种秘密而剧烈的竞争，连她们自己也没有觉察，只不过时刻从她们的言谈举止上显露出来罢了。虽然她们的美丽程度彼此差不多，她们却都用同等的武器在竞争，而且每人都可望取胜。流浪姑娘的到来，突然把这个均势打破了。她是那样美得出奇，当她出现在房门口时，仿佛散发着她特有的光芒，在这间挤满了人的房间里，在这些帏幔和木刻的阴影中，她比在广场上更显得容光焕发，好象是谁把一个火炬从大太阳底下带到了阴暗处来了。高贵的小姐们不由得都感到了她的耀眼的美。每人都觉得自己在她的美貌里受到了某种损害。因此她们的阵线——请原谅我用这个词——也立刻转变了，虽然她们并没有交谈一句，可是她们已经互相了解得很清楚，妇女的直觉，比男人的聪明更能互相了解，互相呼应呢。她们碰到了一个共同的敌手啦，她们全都感觉到了，也全都重新打起了精神。只要滴一滴葡萄酒在一杯水里，就能使整杯水变得绯红；只要突然来了一位更漂亮的妇女，就能使一群漂亮妇女感染某种恶劣情绪——尤其是当有位男子在场的时候。 对那个流浪姑娘的接待自然是格外冷淡了，她们从头到脚地打量她，然后彼此面面相觑，一言不发。她们是相互了解的，但那姑娘却在等着别人同她说话，她非常难为情，连眼皮也不敢抬一下。 队长首先打破了沉默。“说真的，她是个迷人的小人儿呢！”他用毫无顾忌的自负的声调说，“你觉得怎样，好表妹？” 这句赞叹，比较文雅的崇拜者本来应该讲得轻声些的，当然消除不了站在流浪姑娘面前的小姐们的妒嫉。 孚勒尔·德·丽丝用瞧不起的口气回答道：“还不错。” 其余的人低声交谈着。 最后，阿洛伊思夫人——为了她的女儿，她也同样妒嫉呢——向那跳舞姑娘说：“过来，小家伙！” “过来，小家伙！”老太太身后的倍韩日尔用轻视的滑稽口气重复了一遍。 流浪姑娘便向那高贵的夫人走去。 “漂亮的孩子，”弗比斯朝她跟前迈了几步，加重语气说道，“你还认得我吗？我不知道我有没有这种极大的荣幸……” 她抬起眼睛无限温柔地看着他，微笑着打断了他的话：“啊，是呀！” “她记性真好！”孚勒尔·德·丽丝说。 “可是，”弗比斯又说，“那天晚上你很快逃开了，是我把你吓着了吗？” “啊，不是！”流浪姑娘说。 这句“啊，是呀！”紧接着又是一句“啊，不是！”其间仿佛有点难以形容的什么，使孚勒尔·德·丽丝觉得受了伤害。 “我的美人，”弗比斯用那种向街头女郎讲话的随便的语气说道，“你走后却把一个可恶的流氓，一个独眼的驼子留在你原来的地方，他是主教的敲钟人吧，我想。有人告诉过我说他是副主教的养子，说他生下来就是个魔鬼，他有一个可笑的名字，叫做四旬斋、圣枝主日、封斋前的星期二，或者别的什么，总之是个重要的节日，我可记不清了。他竟敢抢走你，倒象你是为了那些教堂工役才出生的！太过分哪！那猫头鹰究竟想把你怎么样呀，嗯？ 告诉我吧！” “我不知道。”她回答。 “想想那多么无聊！一个敲钟人竟敢抢起一位姑娘来了！倒象他是一位子爵呢！一个平民竟玩起上等人的把戏来了！真是少有少见！不过他付出了很高的代价，比埃拉·多尔得许是个最粗暴的人，他从来不轻饶一个无赖，要是你同意，他会巧妙地揭掉那敲钟人的皮！” “可怜的人！”流浪姑娘想起了刚才刑台上的景象。 队长却哈哈大笑：“牛角尖！这种怜悯就象是把一根羽毛插在猪尾巴上！ 我愿意我的肚皮象教皇那样大呢，假若……” 他忽然住了口。“请原谅，小姐们，我想我又要讲出傻话来啦！” “呸，先生！”加耶枫丹说。 “他向那个东西讲的才是他的真心话呢！”孚勒尔·德·丽丝低声说。 她愈来愈烦恼不安了，这种烦恼丝毫没有减少，当她看见队长被那流浪姑娘迷惑着，尤其被他自己迷惑着的时候。队长把脚跟旋转了一下，用十分坦率的军人气派一遍又一遍地在向姑娘献殷勤：“真是个漂亮姑娘，凭我的灵魂担保！” “她穿得真够简陋的！”狄安娜·德·克利斯丹依露出她的漂亮牙齿笑着说道。 这句话给其余的几位带来了一线光明，使她们发现了可以攻击那埃及姑娘的一面，既然无法诽谤她的美貌，她们便朝她的装束方面扑了过来。 “不过这倒是真的，”蒙米歇尔说，“你从哪儿学会了不穿胸衣不戴围巾就在大街上跑呢？” “这条裙子简直短得可怕！”加耶枫丹补充道。 “我亲爱的，”孚勒尔·德·丽丝尖刻地接口说，“沙特雷法庭的十二个警卒要是看见了你的镀金腰带，一定会把你抓去。” “小姑娘，小姑娘，”克利斯丹依冷酷地笑笑说，“要是你的衣袖能遮住胳膊，就不会被太阳晒疼了。” 这一情景的确值得让一位比弗比斯聪明的旁观者来观赏，来看看这些漂亮姑娘怎样讲着毒辣尖刻的话，她们怎样在那街头舞女的周围和她纠缠。她们又残酷又文雅，毫不在乎地盘问和探究她那些寒伧粗笨的镀金装饰品。她们又是讥笑，又是讽刺，又是没完没了的贬薄，冷言冷语不断地向那流浪姑娘倾注，还有高傲的假慈悲和不怀好意的眼光，你简直会觉得好象在看古罗马的小姐们用金针去刺一个漂亮女奴的胸脯呢。你会认为那是些极好的猎狗，它们鼻翼扇动着，眼睛闪亮着，在主人禁止去咬的木制牝鹿旁边转来转去。 站在这些门第高贵的小姐面前的人，终究不过是一个大街上跳舞的穷姑娘罢了！她们仿佛根本没留意她就在那里，竟当着她的面高声议论她，好象在议论某种十分不洁净、十分好玩而又十分好看的东西。 那流浪姑娘对于这类伤害并不是感觉不到，一道羞辱的红晕时时出现在她的脸上，一道愤慨的光芒时时闪露在她的眼中，她的嘴唇好象就要说出侮慢的话来，她扁了扁嘴做出我们给读者描绘过的那种不屑的神气，但她终于默不出声，她一动不动地站在那里，用一种无可奈何的又悲哀又温柔的眼神望着弗比斯。她似乎是因为怕被赶走才努力克制着。 至于弗比斯呢，他是带着半怜惜半粗鲁的神气站在那流浪姑娘一边。 “让她们说去吧，小姑娘！”他碰响了一下金马刺说道，“当然，你的装束有点儿古怪和简陋，可是对于你这样一位漂亮姑娘，那又有什么关系呢！” “我的天呀！”褐色头发的加耶枫丹挺起天鹅般的脖子苦恼地笑着说，“我看王室弓箭手先生碰上了埃及姑娘的眼睛就容易着火啦！” “怎么不是？”弗比斯说。 队长无心地讲出的这句话，好象扔出一块石头却没看见它落到了什么地方。高兰布笑起来了，狄安娜·阿默洛特和孚勒尔·德·丽丝也笑起来了，后一位笑的时候眼睛里含着一滴眼泪。 听见了高兰布·德·加耶枫丹的话就把眼睛望着地板的流浪姑娘，也抬起眼睛重新望着弗比斯，这当儿她真是美极啦。 那老妇人看见这个情景，莫名其妙地恼怒起来。 “圣母呀，”她忽然喊道，“什么东西跑到我身边来啦？啊，讨厌的畜生！” 原来是那只山羊刚刚走来找她的女主人，它向女主人跳过去的时候，两只犄角碰着了那贵妇人坐下时滑在脚上的毛毯。 这倒是个转机，流浪姑娘一句话没说，把小羊牵到身边。 “啊！这不是那只有金脚爪的羊儿吗！”倍韩日尔高兴得跳起来嚷道。 流浪姑娘双膝跪着，把脸孔偎着可爱的羊头，你会以为她是在请求羊儿原谅自己离开了它这么久呢。 这时狄安娜便附在高兰布的耳边说道：“哎，我的天，我怎么早没有想到！这便是那个带着母山羊的流浪姑娘呀。听说她是个女巫，她的母羊会玩些很古怪的把戏。” “哎呀，”高兰布说，“该让这母山羊来蛊惑我们，来给我们表演一个把戏吧！” 狄安娜和高兰布便活泼地向埃及姑娘说道：“小姑娘，叫你的母山羊给我们演一个把戏吧！” “我不懂你的话是什么意思。”跳舞姑娘回答说。 “一个把戏，一场魔法，总之，一种巫术！” “我不懂！”她用手抚摸那漂亮的畜生，一遍又一遍地唤道，“加里，加里！” 这时，孚勒尔·德·丽丝发现山羊脖子上挂着一只绣花的小荷包，便问埃及姑娘：“这是什么呀？” 埃及姑娘抬起大眼睛望着她，认真地回答道：“这是我的秘密。” “我倒很想知道你的秘密是什么呢！”孚勒尔·德·丽丝想道。 这当儿那位好夫人发起脾气来了：“那么，波希米亚姑娘，要是你同你的山羊都不肯给我们跳个什么舞，那你们在这里来干什么的呢？” 那流浪姑娘一句话也不回答，慢慢地向房门口走去，但是她离房门越近，脚步也就越慢下来，好象有一块看不见的磁石吸引着她。忽然她把含着泪花的湿润的眼睛望着弗比斯，停住了脚步。 “真是天晓得！”弗比斯嚷道，“不能这样走掉呀。回来，回来，给我们跳点什么吧。但是，可爱的美人儿，你叫什么名字？” “拉·爱斯梅拉达。”跳舞姑娘的眼睛依然没有离开他。 听到这个古怪的名字，姑娘们发出了一阵哄笑。 “一位小姐有这么个名字真可怕呀！”狄安娜说。 “你明明知道，”阿默洛特说，“她是一个女巫。” “亲爱的。”阿洛伊思夫人用认真的口气说道，“你这个名字一定不是你的父母给你施洗礼时起的。” 这当儿，倍韩日尔便趁着别人没看见，用一块糖把羊儿领到屋角里去了好几分钟，不多一会她俩就成了好朋友。这好奇的女孩解下了羊儿脖子上挂的一只小袋，把它打开，把里面的东西通通倒在地板上。那是一份字母表，每个字母都分别刻在一块小小的黄杨木板上。这些玩具似的字母刚刚倒在地板上，那孩子便惊奇地看见羊儿用金爪子抓起几个字母，轻轻地放在地板上，按照奇怪的顺序排列起来。这当然是一种巫术啦，一会儿就排成了一个字，那山羊好象非常熟练，排列起来毫不费事。倍韩日尔忽然合着双手，赞叹地说道：“孚勒尔·德·丽丝教母！你瞧瞧羊儿刚才干了什么！” 孚勒尔·德·丽丝跑过去一看就气得战栗起来，地板上的字母排列的是这个字：PHOEBUS “这是母山羊写的吗？”她用激动的声音问道。 “是呀，教母。”倍韩日尔回答道。 这是用不着怀疑的，那姑娘本人并不会写字。 “这就是那个秘密啦！”孚勒尔·德·丽丝想。 听到小姑娘的喊声，母亲、姑娘们、波希米亚姑娘和那个军官，通通跑了过去。 流浪姑娘看见山羊刚才干下的蠢事，她的脸一会儿发红一会儿发白，象个罪犯似的在队长面前发起抖来，队长却满意而惊讶地笑着看她。 “弗比斯！”惊呆了的姑娘们互相耳语道，“这是队长的名字呀！” “你的记性好得出奇啊！”孚勒尔·德·丽丝向吓呆了的流浪姑娘说。 接着又叹了几口气。“啊，”她把两只漂亮的手捂着面孔，痛苦地喃喃道，“这是一个女巫！”但是她听见心灵深处有个凄楚的声音告诉她：“这是一个情敌！” 于是她晕倒了。 “我的女儿！我的女儿！”吓坏了的母亲叫喊起来，“滚吧，地狱里的波希米亚女人！” 拉·爱斯梅拉达一会儿便收拾起地上的倒霉字母，向加里做了一个手势，从一道门里走出去了，同时人们正从另一道门里抬出孚勒尔·德·丽丝。 队长弗比斯独自留在那里，在两道门当中迟疑了一会，接着便跟在流浪姑娘身后走了出去。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/264/2530.html","bookId":227,"book":{"id":227,"title":"巴黎圣母院 Notre-Dame de Paris","description":"简介：
