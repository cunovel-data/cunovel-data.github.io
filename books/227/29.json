{"id":6997,"no":29,"title":"Book 6 Chapter 5 End Of The Story Of The Cake","content":"La Esmeralda turned pale and descended from the pillory, staggering as she went. The voice of the recluse still pursued her,--\n \"Descend! descend! Thief of Egypt! thou shalt ascend it once more!\"\n \"The sacked nun is in one of her tantrums,\" muttered the populace; and that was the end of it. For that sort of woman was feared; which rendered them sacred. People did not then willingly attack one who prayed day and night.\n The hour had arrived for removing Quasimodo. He was unbound, the crowd dispersed.\n Near the Grand Pont, Mahiette, who was returning with her two companions, suddenly halted,--\n \"By the way, Eustache! what did you do with that cake?\"\n \"Mother,\" said the child, \"while you were talking with that lady in the bole, a big dog took a bite of my cake, and then I bit it also.\"\n \"What, sir, did you eat the whole of it?\" she went on.\n \"Mother, it was the dog. I told him, but he would not listen to me. Then I bit into it, also.\"\n \"\u0027Tis a terrible child!\" said the mother, smiling and scolding at one and the same time. \"Do you see, Oudarde? He already eats all the fruit from the cherry-tree in our orchard of Charlerange. So his grandfather says that be will be a captain. Just let me catch you at it again, Master Eustache. Come along, you greedy fellow!\"\n End of Volume 1.\n \n 拉·爱斯梅拉达脸色发白，摇摇晃晃地走下了刑台。那隐修女的声音还跟随着她：“下来吧！下来吧！埃及的女扒手！你还会再上去的！”\n “小麻袋又在发脾气哪，”人们悄悄说道，这之后大家就再不说什么了。\n 象她那一类妇女，向来总是被人当做神圣并受到人们尊敬的，谁也不愿去打扰那日夜祈祷的人。\n 开释伽西莫多的时刻到了，他被解下来，人群也就纷纷散开去。\n 马耶特和两个同伴转身刚走到大桥边，她突然停住问道：“哎呀，厄斯达谢，那块玉米面饼呢？”\n “妈妈，”孩子回答道，“你同老鼠洞里那位太太谈话的时候，一条大狗跑来把我的饼咬了一口，我也就吃起来了。”\n “怎么，先生，”她说道，“你通通吃掉了吗？”\n “妈妈，是狗把它吃掉的，我叫它别吃，可是它不听，于是我也就吃了，就是这样。”\n “真是可怕的孩子！”母亲一面微笑一面责备道，“你知道吗，乌达德，他一人就能吃掉我们花园里所有的樱桃呢。难怪他祖父说他日后会当将领。\n 我得好好教训你，厄斯达谢先生！走吧，胖狮子！”\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/264/2529.html","bookId":227,"book":{"id":227,"title":"巴黎圣母院 Notre-Dame de Paris","description":"简介： 丑聋人卡西莫多被巴黎圣母院的神父克洛德收养，做撞钟人，外貌正经的克洛德神父自从遇见美丽的吉普赛少女爱斯美拉达后，被其美色所诱而神魂颠倒，指使卡西莫多强行掳走爱斯美...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/110326/1-110326125SJ96.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/264","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM"}}
