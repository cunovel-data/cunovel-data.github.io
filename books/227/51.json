{"id":7019,"no":51,"title":"Book 10 Chapter 2 Turn Vagabond","content":"On re-entering the cloister, the archdeacon found at the door of his cell his brother Jehan du Moulin, who was waiting for him, and who had beguiled the tedium of waiting by drawing on the wall with a bit of charcoal, a profile of his elder brother, enriched with a monstrous nose.\n Dom Claude hardly looked at his brother; his thoughts were elsewhere. That merry scamp\u0027s face whose beaming had so often restored serenity to the priest\u0027s sombre physiognomy, was now powerless to melt the gloom which grew more dense every day over that corrupted, mephitic, and stagnant soul.\n \"Brother,\" said Jehan timidly, \"I am come to see you.\"\n The archdeacon did not even raise his eyes.\n \"What then?\"\n \"Brother,\" resumed the hypocrite, \"you are so good to me, and you give me such wise counsels that I always return to you.\"\n \"What next?\"\n \"Alas! brother, you were perfectly right when you said to me,--\"Jehan! Jehan! ~cessat doctorum doctrina, discipulorum disciplina~. Jehan, be wise, Jehan, be learned, Jehan, pass not the night outside of the college without lawful occasion and due leave of the master. Cudgel not the Picards: ~noli, Joannes, verberare Picardos~. Rot not like an unlettered ass, ~quasi asinus illitteratus~, on the straw seats of the school. Jehan, allow yourself to be punished at the discretion of the master. Jehan go every evening to chapel, and sing there an anthem with verse and orison to Madame the glorious Virgin Mary.--Alas! what excellent advice was that!\"\n \"And then?\"\n \"Brother, you behold a culprit, a criminal, a wretch, a libertine, a man of enormities! My dear brother, Jehan hath made of your counsels straw and dung to trample under foot. I have been well chastised for it, and God is extraordinarily just. As long as I had money, I feasted, I lead a mad and joyous life. Oh! how ugly and crabbed behind is debauch which is so charming in front! Now I have no longer a blank; I have sold my napery, my shirt and my towels; no more merry life! The beautiful candle is extinguished and I have henceforth, only a wretched tallow dip which smokes in my nose. The wenches jeer at me. I drink water.--I am overwhelmed with remorse and with creditors.\n \"The rest?\" said the archdeacon.\n \"Alas! my very dear brother, I should like to settle down to a better life. I come to you full of contrition, I am penitent. I make my confession. I beat my breast violently. You are quite right in wishing that I should some day become a licentiate and sub-monitor in the college of Torchi. At the present moment I feel a magnificent vocation for that profession. But I have no more ink and I must buy some; I have no more paper, I have no more books, and I must buy some. For this purpose, I am greatly in need of a little money, and I come to you, brother, with my heart full of contrition.\"\n \"Is that all?\"\n \"Yes,\" said the scholar. \"A little money.\"\n \"I have none.\"\n Then the scholar said, with an air which was both grave and resolute: \"Well, brother, I am sorry to be obliged to tell you that very fine offers and propositions are being made to me in another quarter. You will not give me any money? No. In that case I shall become a professional vagabond.\"\n As he uttered these monstrous words, he assumed the mien of Ajax, expecting to see the lightnings descend upon his head.\n The archdeacon said coldly to him,-\n \"Become a vagabond.\"\n Jehan made him a deep bow, and descended the cloister stairs, whistling.\n At the moment when he was passing through the courtyard of the cloister, beneath his brother\u0027s window, he heard that window open, raised his eyes and beheld the archdeacon\u0027s severe head emerge.\n \"Go to the devil!\" said Dom Claude; \"here is the last money which you will get from me?\"\n At the same time, the priest flung Jehan a purse, which gave the scholar a big bump on the forehead, and with which Jehan retreated, both vexed and content, like a dog who had been stoned with marrow bones.\n \n 副主教回到了修道院，发现他的弟弟磨坊的若望正在他的小屋门前等候他，因为等得不耐烦了，就用一块木炭在墙上画了一幅他哥哥的侧面像，鼻子画得挺大。\n 堂·克洛德几乎没看他的弟弟，他在想别的事情。那个无赖脸上快活的神色往常曾经多次使得神甫阴沉的面容变得明朗起来，此刻却不能消除这个腐烂发臭、毫无生气的灵魂日益聚集的浓雾。\n “哥哥，”若望怯怯地说，“我来看望你。”\n 副主教连眼睛都不朝他抬一下，说：“还有呢？”\n “哥哥，”那口是心非的家伙答道，“你对我这么好，给我这么多的好劝告，使我老要跑来找你。”\n “然后呢？”\n “哎，我的哥哥，你说得对呀，你常常告诉我：‘若望，若望，学者的学说和学生的纪律都后继无人和松懈。若望，要聪明，若望，要用功！没有正当理由或是没得到老师许可，不要在学校外面过夜。不要去打那些庇卡底人，不要象目不识丁的驴子一般在学校的麦秸上腐化堕落。要接受老师的责罚。若望，要每天晚上到礼拜堂去向光荣的圣母唱赞美诗，还要静默和祷告。’这是些多么高明的劝告呀。”\n “还有呢？”\n “哥哥，你瞧，我是一个该打该罚的人，是一个可恶的人，放荡的人，是一个堕落的人。我亲爱的哥哥呀，若望把你那些善意的劝告象粪草一般踩在脚下，我受到严厉的惩罚啦，好上帝是非常公平的。我有点钱的时候，享乐，狂欢，过得挺快活。酒色表面上多么迷人，实际上是多么丑恶！现在我一个钱都没有了，我卖掉了我的帽子，我的衬衫，我的擦手毛巾，再没有快活日子啦！漂亮的蜡烛熄灭了，只剩下可怜的一点蜡烛油，怪难闻的。姑娘们嘲笑我。我只喝清水过活，我被悔恨和债主们苦恼着。”\n “此外呢？”\n “哎！最亲爱的哥哥，我很想给自己安排一种好一些的生活，我悔恨交加，回到你跟前来了。我是来忏悔的，我承认。我用拳头狠狠地捶我的胸膛。\n 你有很多理由希望我有一天成为俄当学院的学士和副学监，此刻我更觉得我有做那些事的才能。可是我再没有墨水了，我得再买去；我再没有钢笔了，我得再买去；我再没有纸张了，我得再买去；我再没有书本了，我得再买去。\n 为了这一切我需要一点钱，于是我满怀着悔恨到你跟前来了。”\n “这就是你的全部要求吗？”\n “是呀，要点钱。”\n “我没有钱。”\n 于是那学生用又认真又坚决的态度说道：“那好，我的哥哥，我非常抱歉，不得不告诉你有人在别的方面向我提了些很好的建议和计划。你不愿意给我钱吗？不愿意吗？那么我就当乞丐去。”\n 讲出这奇怪的话时，若望装出阿雅克斯等待着雷霆降到头上的神情。\n 副主教冷冰冰地对他说道：“当你的乞丐去吧！”\n 若望朝他深深地一鞠躬，打着口哨下楼去了。\n 他经过修道院的前庭，走到他哥哥那小屋窗户底下的时候，他听见窗子开了，抬头看见副主教庄严的脑袋探出在窗口上。“滚到魔鬼那里去吧！”\n 堂·克洛德说道，“这是我最后一次给你钱了。”\n 同时神甫扔了一个钱包给若望，把他头上打出了一块疙瘩。若望象一条狗，得到了人家抛给的几块骨头，他又恼怒又高兴地拿着钱包走了。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/264/2551.html","bookId":227,"book":{"id":227,"title":"巴黎圣母院 Notre-Dame de Paris","description":"简介： 丑聋人卡西莫多被巴黎圣母院的神父克洛德收养，做撞钟人，外貌正经的克洛德神父自从遇见美丽的吉普赛少女爱斯美拉达后，被其美色所诱而神魂颠倒，指使卡西莫多强行掳走爱斯美...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/110326/1-110326125SJ96.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/264","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM"}}
