{"id":6980,"no":12,"title":"Book 2 Chapter 5 Result Of The Dangers","content":"Gringoire, thoroughly stunned by his fall, remained on the pavement in front of the Holy Virgin at the street corner. Little by little, he regained his senses; at first, for several minutes, he was floating in a sort of half-somnolent revery, which was not without its charm, in which aeriel figures of the gypsy and her goat were coupled with Quasimodo\u0027s heavy fist. This state lasted but a short time. A decidedly vivid sensation of cold in the part of his body which was in contact with the pavement, suddenly aroused him and caused his spirit to return to the surface.\\n\\n \"Whence comes this chill?\" he said abruptly, to himself. He then perceived that he was lying half in the middle of the gutter.\\n\\n \"That devil of a hunchbacked cyclops!\" he muttered between his teeth; and he tried to rise. But he was too much dazed and bruised; he was forced to remain where he was. Moreover, his hand was tolerably free; he stopped up his nose and resigned himself.\\n\\n \"The mud of Paris,\" he said to himself--for decidedly he thought that he was sure that the gutter would prove his refuge for the night; and what can one do in a refuge, except dream?--\"the mud of Paris is particularly stinking; it must contain a great deal of volatile and nitric salts. That, moreover, is the opinion of Master Nicholas Flamel, and of the alchemists--\"\\n\\n The word \"alchemists\" suddenly suggested to his mind the idea of Archdeacon Claude Frollo. He recalled the violent scene which he had just witnessed in part; that the gypsy was struggling with two men, that Quasimodo had a companion; and the morose and haughty face of the archdeacon passed confusedly through his memory. \"That would be strange!\" he said to himself. And on that fact and that basis he began to construct a fantastic edifice of hypothesis, that card-castle of philosophers; then, suddenly returning once more to reality, \"Come! I\u0027m freezing!\" he ejaculated.\\n\\n The place was, in fact, becoming less and less tenable. Each molecule of the gutter bore away a molecule of heat radiating from Gringoire\u0027s loins, and the equilibrium between the temperature of his body and the temperature of the brook, began to be established in rough fashion.\\n\\n Quite a different annoyance suddenly assailed him. A group of children, those little bare-footed savages who have always roamed the pavements of Paris under the eternal name of ~gamins~, and who, when we were also children ourselves, threw stones at all of us in the afternoon, when we came out of school, because our trousers were not torn--a swarm of these young scamps rushed towards the square where Gringoire lay, with shouts and laughter which seemed to pay but little heed to the sleep of the neighbors. They were dragging after them some sort of hideous sack; and the noise of their wooden shoes alone would have roused the dead. Gringoire who was not quite dead yet, half raised himself.\\n\\n \"Ohé, Hennequin Dandéche! Ohè, Jehan Pincebourde!\" they shouted in deafening tones, \"old Eustache Moubon, the merchant at the corner, has just died. We\u0027ve got his straw pallet, we\u0027re going to have a bonfire out of it. It\u0027s the turn of the Flemish to-day!\"\\n\\n And behold, they flung the pallet directly upon Gringoire, beside whom they had arrived, without espying him. At the same time, one of them took a handful of straw and set off to light it at the wick of the good Virgin.\\n\\n \"S\u0027death!\" growled Gringoire, \"am I going to be too warm now?\"\\n\\n It was a critical moment. He was caught between fire and water; he made a superhuman effort, the effort of a counterfeiter of money who is on the point of being boiled, and who seeks to escape. He rose to his feet, flung aside the straw pallet upon the street urchins, and fled.\\n\\n \"Holy Virgin!\" shrieked the children; \"\u0027tis the merchant\u0027s ghost!\"\\n\\n And they fled in their turn.\\n\\n The straw mattress remained master of the field. Belleforet, Father Le Juge, and Corrozet affirm that it was picked up on the morrow, with great pomp, by the clergy of the quarter, and borne to the treasury of the church of Saint Opportune, where the sacristan, even as late as 1789, earned a tolerably handsome revenue out of the great miracle of the Statue of the Virgin at the corner of the Rue Mauconseil, which had, by its mere presence, on the memorable night between the sixth and seventh of January, 1482, exorcised the defunct Eustache Moubon, who, in order to play a trick on the devil, had at his death maliciously concealed his soul in his straw pallet.\\n\\n \\n\\n 跌昏了的甘果瓦仍然留在街角圣母像跟前的路面上，他渐渐恢复了知觉。起初几分钟他在一种不无温甜的朦胧的幻觉里飘浮，在那里，天使般的波希米亚姑娘和那只山羊的形象，同伽西莫多沉重的拳头连在一起。只不过一会儿工夫，他的身子挨着石板引起的寒冷感觉，使他一下子清醒过来了，他打起了精神。“哪儿来的这股寒气呀？”他突然自问道。他这才发现自己差一点就是躺在一条阴沟里面。\\n\\n “让鬼把那独眼驼子抓去吧！”他咬牙切齿地说着，想站起来。但是他的头相当晕，他太衰弱了。体力不够，他只好依旧躺着。他的双手还能相当自由地活动，便捂着鼻子听天由命了。\\n\\n “巴黎的烂泥啊，”他想道，（因为他非常相信那条阴沟要成为他的住处，你能把一个意想不到的住处怎么样呢？）\\n\\n 巴黎的烂泥特别讨厌，它里面一定含着大量的炭酸盐和硝酸盐。至少尼古拉·弗拉梅尔阁下和炼金家们认为是这样的……\\n\\n “炼金家”这个名词使他忽然想起了副主教克洛德·孚罗洛。他记起了刚才看见的凶暴景象，记起了波希米亚姑娘在两个男子中间挣扎，记起了伽西莫多还有一个同伴，而副主教的阴沉高大的形象便混乱地进入了他的记忆。“这真奇怪！”他想道，根据这点并把它作为基础，他便开始建造一座假想的海市蜃楼——哲学家的那种纸糊的堡垒。接着他又一次回到了现实里，忽然喊道：“哎呀，我都快冻成冰了！”\\n\\n 那个地方的确愈来愈难以待下去了，阴沟里的每一滴水都从甘果瓦的怀里带走一分温暖，他的身体变得跟阴沟里的水一样凉了。\\n\\n 可是立刻又有另一种完全不同的苦恼来袭击他。\\n\\n 一群儿童，就是那些经常在巴黎街头徘徊，永远被人叫做“流浪儿”的赤足小野人，当我们也还是小孩子的时候，每天傍晚放学回家时他们都朝我们扔石子，因为我们的裤子没有撕破。这样一群小家伙跑到了甘果瓦躺着的街口，一路大笑大闹，完全不在乎会不会打扰附近居民的睡梦。他们拖着一个不知做什么用的大口袋，单只他们走路的声音就能够把死人惊醒。还不完全是死人的甘果瓦于是半抬起了身子。\\n\\n “喂，恩纳坎·丹代歇！喂，若望·潘斯布德！”孩子们尖声叫道，“拐角上那个铁货店商人老厄斯达谢·慕邦刚刚死去，我们拿到了他的草席，正好把它烧起一堆篝火来。今天是欢迎弗朗德勒使臣的日子啊。”\\n\\n 他们把草席不偏不倚地刚好抛到了甘果瓦身上，他们来到了他的身边却还没有看见他呢。有个孩子扯下一把草来，拿到圣母像前的蜡烛上去点燃。\\n\\n “倒霉！”甘果瓦嘀咕道，“我现在不是又会太热了吗？”\\n\\n 正在千钧一发之际，正当他处于一边是火一边是水的境地，就象伪币制造者怕被人煮死却又无法逃走一样，他用一种超自然的力量直直地站起来，把草席向流浪儿们扔回去，随后就逃跑了。\\n\\n “圣母呀，”孩子们嚷道，“那个铁货商人复活啦！”\\n\\n 草席成了战场的主人。宗教裁判官倍尔孚雷神甫和加罗扎特都曾经证明：“那个区的神甫于次日将草席郑重地拾起，送去放在圣奥波蒂纳教堂的贮藏室。那个教堂的圣器保管人就每年因莫贡赛耶街拐角处圣母像的那次显灵获得了一笔可观的收入，直到一七八九年。这是因为在一四八二年一月六号到七号那个值得纪念的晚上，由于圣母的显灵，就把厄斯达谢·慕邦死后恶意地躲在草席里打算和魔鬼开玩笑的鬼魂吓跑了。”\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/264/2512.html","bookId":227,"book":{"id":227,"title":"巴黎圣母院 Notre-Dame de Paris","description":"简介： 丑聋人卡西莫多被巴黎圣母院的神父克洛德收养，做撞钟人，外貌正经的克洛德神父自从遇见美丽的吉普赛少女爱斯美拉达后，被其美色所诱而神魂颠倒，指使卡西莫多强行掳走爱斯美...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/110326/1-110326125SJ96.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/264","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM"}}
