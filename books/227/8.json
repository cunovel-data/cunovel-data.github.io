{"id":6976,"no":8,"title":"Book 2 Chapter 1 From Charybdis To Scylia","content":"Night comes on early in January. The streets were already dark when Gringoire issued forth from the Courts. This gloom pleased him; he was in haste to reach some obscure and deserted alley, in order there to meditate at his ease, and in order that the philosopher might place the first dressing upon the wound of the poet. Philosophy, moreover, was his sole refuge, for he did not know where he was to lodge for the night. After the brilliant failure of his first theatrical venture, he dared not return to the lodging which he occupied in the Rue Grenier-sur-l\u0027Eau, opposite to the Port-au-Foin, having depended upon receiving from monsieur the provost for his epithalamium, the wherewithal to pay Master Guillaume Doulx-Sire, farmer of the taxes on cloven-footed animals in Paris, the rent which he owed him, that is to say, twelve sols parisian; twelve times the value of all that he possessed in the world, including his trunk-hose, his shirt, and his cap. After reflecting a moment, temporarily sheltered beneath the little wicket of the prison of the treasurer of the Sainte- Chappelle, as to the shelter which he would select for the night, having all the pavements of Paris to choose from, he remembered to have noticed the week previously in the Rue de la Savaterie, at the door of a councillor of the parliament, a stepping stone for mounting a mule, and to have said to himself that that stone would furnish, on occasion, a very excellent pillow for a mendicant or a poet. He thanked Providence for having sent this happy idea to him; but, as he was preparing to cross the Place, in order to reach the tortuous labyrinth of the city, where meander all those old sister streets, the Rues de la Barillerie, de la Vielle-Draperie, de la Savaterie, de la Juiverie, etc., still extant to-day, with their nine-story houses, he saw the procession of the Pope of the Fools, which was also emerging from the court house, and rushing across the courtyard, with great cries, a great flashing of torches, and the music which belonged to him, Gringoire. This sight revived the pain of his self-love; he fled. In the bitterness of his dramatic misadventure, everything which reminded him of the festival of that day irritated his wound and made it bleed.\\n\\n He was on the point of turning to the Pont Saint-Michel; children were running about here and there with fire lances and rockets.\\n\\n \"Pest on firework candles!\" said Gringoire; and he fell back on the Pont au Change. To the house at the head of the bridge there had been affixed three small banners, representing the king, the dauphin, and Marguerite of Flanders, and six little pennons on which were portrayed the Duke of Austria, the Cardinal de Bourbon, M. de Beaujeu, and Madame Jeanne de France, and Monsieur the Bastard of Bourbon, and I know not whom else; all being illuminated with torches. The rabble were admiring.\\n\\n \"Happy painter, Jehan Fourbault!\" said Gringoire with a deep sigh; and he turned his back upon the bannerets and pennons. A street opened before him; he thought it so dark and deserted that he hoped to there escape from all the rumors as well as from all the gleams of the festival. At the end of a few moments his foot came in contact with an obstacle; he stumbled and fell. It was the May truss, which the clerks of the clerks\u0027 law court had deposited that morning at the door of a president of the parliament, in honor of the solemnity of the day. Gringoire bore this new disaster heroically; he picked himself up, and reached the water\u0027s edge. After leaving behind him the civic Tournelle* and the criminal tower, and skirted the great walls of the king\u0027s garden, on that unpaved strand where the mud reached to his ankles, he reached the western point of the city, and considered for some time the islet of the Passeur-aux-Vaches, which has disappeared beneath the bronze horse of the Pont Neuf. The islet appeared to him in the shadow like a black mass, beyond the narrow strip of whitish water which separated him from it. One could divine by the ray of a tiny light the sort of hut in the form of a beehive where the ferryman of cows took refuge at night.\\n\\n * A chamber of the ancient parliament of Paris.\\n\\n \"Happy ferryman!\" thought Gringoire; \"you do not dream of glory, and you do not make marriage songs! What matters it to you, if kings and Duchesses of Burgundy marry? You know no other daisies (~marguerites~) than those which your April greensward gives your cows to browse upon; while I, a poet, am hooted, and shiver, and owe twelve sous, and the soles of my shoes are so transparent, that they might serve as glasses for your lantern! Thanks, ferryman, your cabin rests my eyes, and makes me forget Paris!\"\\n\\n He was roused from his almost lyric ecstacy, by a big double Saint-Jean cracker, which suddenly went off from the happy cabin. It was the cow ferryman, who was taking his part in the rejoicings of the day, and letting off fireworks.\\n\\n This cracker made Gringoire\u0027s skin bristle up all over.\\n\\n \"Accursed festival!\" he exclaimed, \"wilt thou pursue me everywhere? Oh! good God! even to the ferryman\u0027s!\"\\n\\n Then he looked at the Seine at his feet, and a horrible temptation took possession of him:\\n\\n \"Oh!\" said he, \"I would gladly drown myself, were the water not so cold!\"\\n\\n Then a desperate resolution occurred to him. It was, since he could not escape from the Pope of the Fools, from Jehan Fourbault\u0027s bannerets, from May trusses, from squibs and crackers, to go to the Place de Grève.\\n\\n \"At least,\" he said to himself, \"I shall there have a firebrand of joy wherewith to warm myself, and I can sup on some crumbs of the three great armorial bearings of royal sugar which have been erected on the public refreshment-stall of the city.\\n\\n \\n\\n 正月里夜晚来得很早，甘果瓦走出司法宫时，街上已经昏黑了。夜的降临很令他高兴，他正想找一条幽静的街道，以便随意沉思，好让哲学给诗人的创伤作初步的包扎。而且哲学正是他独一无二的藏身之处，反正他不知道往哪儿去投宿。在他的戏上演流产之后，他不敢回到他在干草港对面水上楼街所住的那个客栈去。他本来认定总督大人要为了他的贺婚诗给他些钱，好拿去付还他欠巴黎牲畜税承包人居约姆·杜克斯·西尔老板的六个月房租——相当于十二个巴黎索尔，他在世界上所有的一切，包括他的短裤、衬衫和汗背心在内，合起来还值不到一个索尔呢。稍微考虑了一下，他就暂时待在圣礼拜堂的库房监狱的小门洞里，至于过夜的地方，他可以在巴黎所有街道中任选一处。他记起上星期在制鞋街一个参事官的门口看见过一块骑马磴，那时他就曾经想，有时候这块石头倒可以给一个乞丐或是一位诗人当枕头用呢。他感谢上天给他送来了这么个好主意，可是当他正要穿过司法宫广场走向迷宫似的旧城区时（所有暗旧的街道如制桶场街、老昵绒街、制鞋街、犹太街等等，都曲曲折折地布满在那里，它们那些九层楼房至今依旧巍然矗立），他忽然看见愚人王的行列也正从司法宫出来，带着大声的吆喝，亮晃晃的火炬和他的乐队，正穿过街道向他甘果瓦奔来。这个景象使他重新想起了他那自尊心所受的创伤，他躲开了。由于他的戏剧的失败所引起的痛苦，凡是能使他记起那个节日的一切事物，都使他心酸，使他的伤口流血。\\n\\n 他打算从圣米歇尔桥走，有些儿童在桥上跑来跑去地放花炮。\\n\\n “该死的花炮！”甘果瓦一面咒骂着，绕到了欧项热桥。桥头堡上挂着三幅很大的油画像，上面画的是国王、太子和弗朗德勒的公主，另外有六幅小的油画像，画的是奥地利的公爵，波旁的红衣主教，德·波热先生，让娜·德·法朗士夫人，波旁的私生子先生，还有一个不知是谁。全都被火把照得通亮，成群的人在那里观赏。\\n\\n “幸运的画家若望·富尔波！”甘果瓦长叹了一声，朝着画像背转身走了。他前面就是一条街，他发现这条街非常僻静和昏黑，就打算在这里逃避节庆日子里嘈杂、辉煌的一切。过了一会，他的脚踏着了一个什么东西，绊了一下，跌倒了。原来那是五月树，是大理院的书记们在那天早上放在大理院院长的大门口庆祝节日的。甘果瓦勇敢地忍受了这个新的打击。他站起来，走到了河边。把大理院的民事庭和刑事庭扔在背后，他沿着王宫花园的高墙走去，在没有铺砌的河滩上，泥泞一直没到他的脚胫。他来到旧城区的西头，久久地俯看渡牛岛，这个小岛如今早已消失在铜马和新桥底下。被一条发白的小河把他隔开的那个小岛，在阴暗里好象一个黑堆。只要有一线亮光，就看得见摆渡人晚上渡河时住宿的那象蜂窝似的小房子。\\n\\n “幸福的摆渡人！”甘果瓦想道，“你并不幻想光荣，也用不着写什么贺婚诗！联姻的国王们和勃艮第公爵夫人们对于你算不了什么！你只认识那些在四月的草地上给你的母牛当饲料的雏菊！我呢，我是一个诗人，但我受人讥笑，我冷得发抖，我欠人家十二个索尔，我的鞋底薄得可以做你灯上的玻璃。谢谢你，摆渡人！你的草屋使我开了眼界，使我忘记了巴黎！”\\n\\n 忽然从那间草屋里发出一声比圣若望的爆竹大一倍的爆炸声，把他从略带诗意的梦幻中惊醒了。原来是摆渡人放了个花炮来庆祝节日。\\n\\n 这花炮声使甘果瓦毛骨悚然。\\n\\n “该死的节日！”他嚷道，“你要到处跟着我吗？我的上帝，一直跟到摆渡人这里来了！”\\n\\n 于是他望着脚边的塞纳河，起了一个可怕的念头：“哦！”他说，“我多么愿意跳下河去，要是河水不这样冷！”\\n\\n 这时他下了失望后的决心，既然躲不开愚人王的选举、若望·富尔波的油画、五月树、篝火同花炮，他便决定大着胆子钻进节日的中心去，到格雷沃广场去。\\n\\n “至少，”他想道，“我在那边能够有一堆篝火可以取暖，还能在市民区的会餐大桌上弄到三大块甜点心渣儿做晚饭。”\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/264/2508.html","bookId":227,"book":{"id":227,"title":"巴黎圣母院 Notre-Dame de Paris","description":"简介： 丑聋人卡西莫多被巴黎圣母院的神父克洛德收养，做撞钟人，外貌正经的克洛德神父自从遇见美丽的吉普赛少女爱斯美拉达后，被其美色所诱而神魂颠倒，指使卡西莫多强行掳走爱斯美...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/110326/1-110326125SJ96.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/264","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM"}}
