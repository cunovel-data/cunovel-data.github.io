{"id":108353,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"Dr. Fanshawe ceased gazing at his boots. He looked up and spoke to a point somewhere above M.\u0027s left shoulder. \"Certainly. So does Mr. Snowman of Wart-ski\u0027s, the greatest Fabergé experts and dealers in the world. It is undoubtedly the missing masterpiece of which hitherto Carl Fabergé\u0027s sketch was the only record.\"\\n\\n \"What about the provenance? What do the experts say about that?\"\\n\\n \"It stands up adequately. The greatest Fabergé pieces were nearly always privately commissioned. Miss Freudenstein says that her grandfather was a vastly rich man before the revolution—a porcelain manufacturer. Ninety-nine percent of all Fabergé\u0027s output has found its way abroad. There are only a few pieces left in the Kremlin—described simply as \u0027pre-revolutionary examples of Russian jewelry.\u0027 The official Soviet view has always been that they are merely capitalist baubles. Officially they despise them as they officially despise their superb collection of French Impressionists.\"\\n\\n \"So the Soviet still retain some examples of the work of this man Fabergé. Is it possible that this emerald affair could have lain secreted somewhere in the Kremlin through all these years?\"\\n\\n \"Certainly. The Kremlin treasure is vast. No one knows what they keep hidden. They have only recently put on display what they have wanted to put on display.\"\\n\\n M. drew on his pipe. His eyes through the smoke were bland, scarcely interested. \"So that, in theory, there is no reason why this emerald ball should not have been unearthed from the Kremlin, furnished with a faked history to establish ownership, and transferred abroad as a reward to some friend of Russia for services rendered?\"\\n\\n \"None at all. It would be an ingenious method of greatly rewarding the beneficiary without the danger of paying large sums into his, or her, bank account.\"\\n\\n \"But the final monetary reward would of course depend on the amount realized by the sale of the object—the auction price for instance?\"\\n\\n \"Exactly.\"\\n\\n \"And what do you expect this object to fetch at Sotheby\u0027s?\"\\n\\n \"Impossible to say. Wartski\u0027s will certainly bid very high. But of course they wouldn\u0027t be prepared to tell anyone just how high—either on their own account for stock, so to speak, or acting on behalf of a customer. Much would depend on how high they are forced up by an underbidder. Anyway, not less than £100,000 I\u0027d say.\"\\n\\n \"Hm.\" M.\u0027s mouth turned down at the corners. \"Expensive hunk of jewelry.\"\\n\\n Dr. Fanshawe was aghast at this barefaced revelation of M.\u0027s philistinism. He actually looked M. straight in the face. \"My dear sir,\" he expostulated, \"do you consider the stolen Goya, sold at Sotheby\u0027s for £140,000, that went to the National Gallery, just an expensive hunk, as you put it, of canvas and paint?\"\\n\\n M. said placatingly, \"Forgive me, Dr. Fanshawe. I expressed myself clumsily. I have never had the leisure to interest myself in works of art nor, on a naval officer\u0027s pay, the money to acquire any. I was just registering my dismay at the runaway prices being fetched at auction these days.\"\\n\\n \"You are entitled to your views, sir,\" said Dr. Fanshawe stuffily.\\n\\n Bond thought it was time to rescue M. He also wanted to get Dr. Fanshawe out of the room so that they could get down to the professional aspects of this odd business. He got to his feet. He said to M., \"Well, sir, I don\u0027t think there is anything else I need to know. No doubt this will turn out to be perfectly straightforward (like hell it would!) and just a matter of one of your staff turning out to be a very lucky woman. But it\u0027s very kind of Dr. Fanshawe to have gone to so much trouble.\" He turned to Dr. Fanshawe. \"Would you care to have a staff car to take you wherever you\u0027re going?\"\\n\\n \"No thank you, thank you very much. It will be pleasant to walk across the park.\"\\n\\n Hands were shaken, good-byes said and Bond showed the doctor out. Bond came back into the room. M. had taken a bulky file, stamped with the top secret red star, out of a drawer and was already immersed in it. Bond took his seat again and waited. The room was silent save for the riffling of paper. This also stopped as M. extracted a foolscap sheet of blue cardboard used for Confidential Staff Records and carefully read through the forest of close type on both sides.\\n\\n Finally he slipped it back in the file and looked up. \"Yes,\" he said and the blue eyes were bright with interest. \"It fits all right. The girl was born in Paris in 1935. Mother very active in the Resistance during the war. Helped run the Tulip Escape Route and got away with it. After the war, the girl went to the Sorbonne and then got a job in the Embassy, in the Naval Attaché\u0027s office, as an interpreter. You know the rest. She was compromised—some unattractive sexual business—by some of her mother\u0027s old Resistance friends who by then were working for the NKVD, and from then on she has been working under Control. She applied, no doubt on instruction, for British citizenship. Her clearance from the Embassy and her mother\u0027s Resistance record helped her to get that by 1959, and she was then recommended to us by the FO. But it was there that she made her big mistake. She asked for a year\u0027s leave before coming to us and was next reported by the Hutchinson network in the Leningrad espionage school. There she presumably received the usual training and we had to decide what to do about her. Section 100 thought up the Purple Cipher operation and you know the rest. She\u0027s been working for three years inside headquarters for the KGB and now she\u0027s getting her reward—this emerald ball thing worth £100,000. And that\u0027s interesting on two counts. First it means that the KGB is totally hooked on the Purple Cipher or they wouldn\u0027t be making this fantastic payment. That\u0027s good news. It means that we can hot up the material we\u0027re passing over—put across some Grade 3 deception material and perhaps even move up to Grade 2. Secondly, it explains something we\u0027ve never been able to understand—that this girl hasn\u0027t hitherto received a single payment for her services. We were worried by that. She had an account at Glyn, Mills that only registered her monthly paycheck of around £50. And she\u0027s consistently lived within it. Now she\u0027s getting her payoff in one large lump sum via this bauble we\u0027ve been learning about. All very satisfactory.\"\\n\\n M. reached for the ashtray made out of a twelve-inch shell base and rapped out his pipe with the air of a man who has done a good afternoon\u0027s work.\\n\\n Bond shifted in his chair. He badly needed a cigarette, but he wouldn\u0027t have dreamed of lighting one. He wanted one to help him focus his thoughts. He felt that there were some ragged edges to this problem—one particularly. He said, mildly, \"Have we ever caught up with her local Control, sir? How does she get her instructions?\"\\n\\n \"Doesn\u0027t need to,\" said M. impatiently, busying himself with his pipe. \"Once she\u0027d got hold of the Purple Cipher all she needed to do was hold down her job. Damn it man, she\u0027s pouring the stuff into their lap six times a day. What sort of instructions would they need to give her? I doubt if the KGB men in London even know of her existence—perhaps the Resident Director does, but as you know we don\u0027t even know who he is. Give my eyes to find out.\"\\n\\n Bond suddenly had a flash of intuition. It was as if a camera had started grinding in his skull, grinding out a length of clear film. He said quietly, \"It might be that this business at Sotheby\u0027s could show him to us—show us who he is.\"\\n\\n \"What the devil are you talking about, 007? Explain yourself.\"\\n\\n \"Well sir,\" Bond\u0027s voice was calm with certainty, \"you remember what this Dr. Fanshawe said about an underbidder—someone to make these Wartski merchants go to their very top price. If the Russians don\u0027t seem to know or care very much about Fabergé, as Dr. Fanshawe says, they may have no very clear idea what this thing\u0027s really worth. The KGB wouldn\u0027t be likely to know about such things anyway. They may imagine it\u0027s only worth its break-up value—say ten or twenty thousand pounds for the emerald. That sort of sum would make more sense than the small fortune the girl\u0027s going to get if Dr. Fanshawe\u0027s right. Well, if the Resident Director is the only man who knows about this girl, he will be the only man who knows she\u0027s been paid. So he\u0027ll be the underbidder. He\u0027ll be sent to Sotheby\u0027s and told to push the sale through the roof. I\u0027m certain of it. So we\u0027ll be able to identify him and we\u0027ll have enough on him to have him sent home. He just won\u0027t know what\u0027s hit him. Nor will the KGB. If I can go to the sale and bowl him out and we\u0027ve got the place covered with cameras, and the auction records, we can get the FO to declare him persona non grata inside a week. And Resident Directors don\u0027t grow on trees. It may be months before the KGB can appoint a replacement.\"\\n\\n M. said, thoughtfully, \"Perhaps you\u0027ve got something there.\" He swiveled his chair round and gazed out of the big window towards the jagged skyline of London. Finally he said, over his shoulder, \"All right, 007. Go and see the Chief of Staff and set the machinery up. I\u0027ll square things with Five. It\u0027s their territory, but it\u0027s our bird. There won\u0027t be any trouble. But don\u0027t go and get carried away and bid for this bit of rubbish yourself. I haven\u0027t got the money to spare.\"\\n\\n Bond said, \"No sir.\" He got to his feet and went quickly out of the room. He thought he had been very clever and he wanted to see if he had. He didn\u0027t want M. to change his mind.\\n\\n Wartski has a modest, ultra-modern frontage at 138 Regent Street. The window, with a restrained show of modern and antique jewelry, gave no hint that these were the greatest Fabergé-dealers in the world. The interior—gray carpet, walls paneled in sycamore, a few unpretentious vitrines—held none of the excitement of Cartier\u0027s, Boucheron or Van Cleef, but the group of famed Royal Warrants from Queen Mary, the Queen Mother, the Queen, King Paul of Greece and the unlikely King Frederick IX of Denmark, suggested that this was no ordinary jeweler.\\n\\n James Bond asked for Mr. Kenneth Snowman. A good-looking, very well-dressed man of about 40 rose from a group of men sitting with their heads together at the back of the room and came forward.\\n\\n Bond said quietly, \"I\u0027m from the C.I.D. Can we have a talk? Perhaps you\u0027d like to check my credentials first. My name\u0027s James Bond. But you\u0027ll have to go direct to Sir Ronald Vallance or his P.A. I\u0027m not directly on the strength at Scotland Yard. Sort of liaison job.\"\\n\\n The intelligent, observant eyes didn\u0027t appear even to look him over. The man smiled. \"Come on downstairs. Just having a talk with some American friends—sort of correspondents really. From \u0027Old Russia\u0027 on Fifth Avenue.\"\\n\\n \"I know the place,\" said Bond. \"Full of rich-looking icons and so on. Not far from the Pierre.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\" Mr. Snowman seemed even more reassured. He led the way down a narrow, thickly carpeted stairway into a large and glittering showroom which was obviously the real treasure house of the shop. Gold and diamonds and cut stones winked from lit cases round the walls.\\n\\n \"Have a seat. Cigarette?\"\\n\\n Bond took one of his own. \"It\u0027s about this Fabergé that\u0027s coming up at Sotheby\u0027s tomorrow—this Emerald Sphere.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, yes.\" Mr. Snowman\u0027s clear brow furrowed anxiously. \"No trouble about it I hope?\"\\n\\n \"Not from your point of view. But we\u0027re very interested in the actual sale. We know about the owner, Miss Freudenstein. We think there may be an attempt to raise the bidding artificially. We\u0027re interested in the underbidder—assuming, that is, that your firm will be leading the field, so to speak.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/octopussy-the-living-daylights-james-bond-14/page-11.html","bookId":1556,"book":{"id":1556,"title":"Octopussy \u0026 the Living Daylights (James Bond #14)","description":"Storyline: Octopussy \u0026 the Living Daylights (James Bond (Original Series) #14) \\n Whether it is tracking down a wayward major who has taken a deadly secret with him to the Caribbean or identifying a top Russian agent secretly bidding for a Fabergé egg in a Sotheby’s auction room, Bond always closes the case—with extreme prejudice.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/octopussy-the-living-daylights-james-bond-14.jpg","author":"Ian Fleming","type":"Adventure","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/octopussy-the-living-daylights-james-bond-14.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:18:42 PM"}}
