{"id":108352,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"\"Trigger was a woman.\"\n \"So what? KGB has got plenty of women agents—and women gunners. I\u0027m not in the least surprised. The Russian woman\u0027s team always does well in the World Championships. Last meeting, in Moscow, they came first, second, and third against seventeen countries. I can even remember two of their names—Donskaya and Lomova. Terrific shots. She may even have been one of them. What did she look like? Records\u0027ll probably be able to turn her up.\"\n \"She was a blonde. She was the girl who carried the cello in that orchestra. Probably had her gun in the cello case. The orchestra was to cover up the shooting.\"\n \"Oh!\" said Captain Sender slowly. \"I see. The girl you were keen on?\"\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\n \"Well, I\u0027m sorry, but I\u0027ll have to put that in my report too. You had clear orders to exterminate Trigger.\"\n There came the sound of a car approaching. It pulled up somewhere below. The bell rang twice. Sender said, \"Well, let\u0027s get going. They\u0027ve sent an armored car to get us out of here.\" He paused. His eyes flicked over Bond\u0027s shoulder, avoiding Bond\u0027s eyes. \"Sorry about the report. Got to do my duty, y\u0027know. You should have killed that sniper whoever it was.\"\n Bond got up. He suddenly didn\u0027t want to leave the stinking little smashed-up flat, leave the place from which, for three days, he had had this long-range, onesided romance with an unknown girl—an unknown enemy agent with much the same job in her outfit as he had in his. Poor little bitch! She would be in worse trouble now than he was! She\u0027d certainly be court-martialed for muffing this job. Probably be kicked out of the KGB. He shrugged. At least they\u0027d stop short of killing her—as he himself had done.\n James Bond said wearily, \"Okay. With any luck it\u0027ll cost me my Double-O number. But tell Head of Station not to worry. That girl won\u0027t do any more sniping. Probably lost her left hand. Certainly broke her nerve for that kind of work. Scared the living daylights out of her. In my book, that was enough. Let\u0027s go.\"\n THE PROPERTY OF A LADY\n It was, exceptionally, a hot day in early June. James Bond put down the dark gray chalk pencil that was the marker for the dockets routed to the Double-O Section and took off his coat. He didn\u0027t bother to hang it over the back of his chair, let alone take the trouble to get up and drape the coat over the hanger Mary Goodnight had suspended, at her own cost (damn women!), behind the Office of Works\u0027 green door of his connecting office. He dropped the coat on the floor. There was no reason to keep the coat immaculate, the creases tidy. There was no sign of any work to be done. All over the world there was quiet. The In and Out signals had, for weeks, been routine. The daily top secret SITREP, even the newspapers, yawned vacuously—in the latter case scratchings at domestic scandals for readership, for bad news, the only news that makes such sheets readable, whether top secret or on sale for pennies.\n Bond hated these periods of vacuum. His eyes, his mind, were barely in focus as he turned the pages of a jaw-breaking dissertation by the Scientific Research Station on the Russian use of cyanide gas, propelled by the cheapest bulb-handled children\u0027s water pistol, for assassination. The spray, it seemed, directed at the face, took instantaneous effect. It was recommended for victims from 25 years upwards, on ascending stairways or inclines. The verdict would then probably be heart-failure.\n The harsh burr of the red telephone sprayed into the room so suddenly that James Bond, his mind elsewhere, reached his hand automatically towards his left armpit in self-defense. The edges of his mouth turned down as he recognized the reflex. On the second burr he picked up the receiver.\n \"Sir?\"\n \"Sir.\"\n He got up from his chair and picked up his coat. He put on the coat and at the same time put on his mind. He had been dozing in his bunk. Now he had to go up on the bridge. He walked through into the connecting office and resisted the impulse to ruffle up the inviting nape of Mary Goodnight\u0027s golden neck.\n He told her \"M.\" and walked out into the close-carpeted corridor and along, between the muted whizz and zing of the Communications Section, of which his Section was a neighbor, to the lift and up to the eighth.\n Miss Moneypenny\u0027s expression conveyed nothing. It usually conveyed something if she knew something—private excitement, curiosity, or, if Bond was in trouble, encouragement or even anger. Now the smile of welcome showed disinterest. Bond registered that this was going to be some kind of a routine job, a bore, and he adjusted his entrance through that fateful door accordingly.\n There was a visitor—a stranger. He sat on M.\u0027s left. He only briefly glanced up as Bond came in and took his usual place across the red-leather-topped desk.\n M. said, stiffly, \"Dr. Fanshawe, I don\u0027t think you\u0027ve met Commander Bond of my Research Department.\"\n Bond was used to these euphemisms.\n He got up and held out his hand. Dr. Fanshawe rose, briefly touched Bond\u0027s hand and sat quickly down as if he had touched paws with a Gila monster.\n If he looked at Bond, inspected him and took him in as anything more than an anatomical silhouette, Bond thought that Dr. Fanshawe\u0027s eyes must be fitted with a thousandth of a second shutter. So this was obviously some kind of an expert—a man whose interests lay in facts, things, theories—not in human beings. Bond wished that M. had given him some kind of a brief, hadn\u0027t got this puckish, rather childishly malign desire to surprise—to spring the jack-in-a-box on his staff. But Bond, remembering his own boredom of ten minutes ago, and putting himself in M.\u0027s place, had the intuition to realize that M. himself might have been subject to the same June heat, the same oppressive vacuum in his duties, and, faced by the unexpected relief of an emergency, a small one perhaps, had decided to extract the maximum effect, the maximum drama, out of it to relieve his own tedium.\n The stranger was middle-aged, rosy, well-fed, and clothed rather foppishly in the neo-Edwardian fashion—turned-up cuffs to his dark blue, four-buttoned coat, a pearl pin in a heavy silk cravat, spotless wing collar, cufflinks formed of what appeared to be antique coins, pince-nez on a thick black ribbon. Bond summed him up as something literary, a critic perhaps, a bachelor—possibly with homosexual tendencies.\n M. said, \"Dr. Fanshawe is a noted authority on antique jewelry. He is also, though this is confidential, adviser to H.M. Customs and to the C.I.D. on such things. He has La fact been referred to me by our friends at M.I.5. It is in connection with our Miss Freudenstein.\"\n Bond raised his eyebrows. Maria Freudenstein was a secret agent working for the Soviet KGB in the heart of the Secret Service. She was in the Communications Department, but in a watertight compartment of it that had been created especially for her, and her duties were confined to operating the Purple Cipher—a cipher which had also been created especially for her. Six times a day she was responsible for encoding and dispatching lengthy SITREPS in this cipher to the C.I.A. in Washington. These messages were the output of Section 100 which was responsible for running double agents. They were an ingenious mixture of true fact, harmless disclosures and an occasional nugget of the grossest misinformation. Maria Freudenstein, who had been known to be a Soviet agent when she was taken into the Service, had been allowed to steal the key to the Purple Cipher with the intention that the Russians should have complete access to these SITREPS—be able to intercept and decipher them—and thus, when appropriate, be fed false information. It was a highly secret operation which needed to be handled with extreme delicacy, but it had now been running smoothly for three years and, if Maria Freudenstein also picked up a certain amount of canteen gossip at Headquarters, that was a necessary risk, and she was not attractive enough to form liaisons which could be a security risk.\n M. turned to Dr. Fanshawe. \"Perhaps, Doctor, you would care to tell Commander Bond what it is all about.\"\n \"Certainly, certainly.\" Dr. Fanshawe looked quickly at Bond and then away again. He addressed his boots. \"You see, it\u0027s like this, er, Commander. You\u0027ve heard of a man called Fabergé, no doubt. Famous Russian jeweler.\"\n \"Made fabulous Easter eggs for the Czar and Czarina before the revolution.\"\n \"That was indeed one of his specialties. He made many other exquisite pieces of what we may broadly describe as objects of vertu. Today, in the sale rooms, the best examples fetch truly fabulous prices—£50,000 and more. And recently there entered this country the most amazing specimen of all—the so-called Emerald Sphere, a work of supreme art hitherto known only from a sketch by the great man himself. This treasure arrived by registered post from Paris and it was addressed to this woman of whom you know, Miss Maria Freudenstein.\"\n \"Nice little present. Might I ask how you learned of it, Doctor?\"\n \"I am, as your Chief has told you, an adviser to H.M. Customs and Excise in matters concerning antique jewelry and similar works of art. The declared value of the package was £100,000. This was unusual. There are methods of opening such packages clandestinely. The package was opened—under a Home Office Warrant, of course—and I was called in to examine the contents and give a valuation. I immediately recognized the Emerald Sphere from the account and sketch of it given in Mr. Kenneth Snowman\u0027s definitive work on Fabergé. I said that the declared price might well be on the low side. But what I found of particular interest was the accompanying document which gave, in Russian and French, the provenance of this priceless object.\" Dr. Fanshawe gestured towards a photostat of what appeared to be a brief family tree that lay on the desk in front of M. \"That is a copy I had made. Briefly, it states that the Sphere was commissioned by Miss Freudenstein\u0027s grandfather directly from Fabergé in 1917—no doubt as a means of turning some of his rubles into something portable and of great value. On his death in 1918 it passed to his brother and thence, in 1950, to Miss Freudenstein\u0027s mother. She, it appears, left Russia as a child and lived in White Russian émigré circles in Paris. She never married, but gave birth to this girl, Maria, illegitimately. It seems that she died last year and that some friend or executor, the paper is not signed, has now forwarded the Sphere to its rightful owner, Miss Maria Freudenstein. I had no reason to question this girl, although as you can imagine my interest was most lively, until last month Sotheby\u0027s announced that they would auction the piece, described as \u0027the property of a lady\u0027 in a week from today. On behalf of the British Museum and, er, other interested parties, I then made discreet inquiries and met the lady, who, with perfect composure, confirmed the rather unlikely story contained in the provenance. It was then that I learned that she worked for the Ministry of Defense and it crossed my rather suspicious mind that it was, to say the least of it, odd that a junior clerk, engaged presumably on sensitive duties, should suddenly receive a gift to the value of £100,000 or more from abroad. I spoke to a senior official in M.I.5 with whom I have some contact through my work for H.M. Customs and I was in due course referred to this, er, department.\" Dr. Fanshawe spread his hands and gave Bond a brief glance. \"And that, Commander, is all I have to tell you.\"\n M. broke in, \"Thank you, Doctor. Just one or two final questions and I won\u0027t detain you any further. You have examined this emerald ball thing and you pronounce it genuine?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/octopussy-the-living-daylights-james-bond-14/page-10.html","bookId":1556,"book":{"id":1556,"title":"Octopussy \u0026 the Living Daylights (James Bond #14)","description":"Storyline: \n Octopussy \u0026 the Living Daylights (James Bond (Original Series) #14) \n Whether it is tracking down a wayward major who has taken a deadly secret with him to the Caribbean or identifying a top Russian agent secretly bidding for a Fabergé egg in a Sotheby’s auction room, Bond always closes the case—with extreme prejudice.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/octopussy-the-living-daylights-james-bond-14.jpg","author":"Ian Fleming","type":"Adventure","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/octopussy-the-living-daylights-james-bond-14.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:18:42 PM"}}
