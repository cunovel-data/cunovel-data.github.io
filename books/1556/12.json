{"id":108354,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"\"Well, er, yes,\" said Mr. Snowman with rather careful candor. \"We\u0027re certainly going to go after it. But it\u0027ll sell for a huge price. Between you and me, we believe the V and A are going to bid, and probably the Metropolitan. But is it some crook you\u0027re after? If so you needn\u0027t worry. This is out of their class.\"\n Bond said, \"No. We\u0027re not looking for a crook.\" He wondered how far to go with this man. Because people are very careful with the secrets of their own business doesn\u0027t mean that they\u0027ll be careful with the secrets of yours. Bond picked up a wood and ivory plaque that lay on the table. It said:\n It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer.\n But when he is gone his way, he boasteth.\n Proverbs XX, 14\n Bond was amused. He said so. \"You can read the whole history of the bazaar, of the dealer and the customer, behind that quotation,\" he said. He looked Mr. Snowman straight in the eyes. \"I need that sort of nose, that sort of intuition in this case. Will you give me a hand?\"\n \"Certainly. If you\u0027ll tell me how I can help.\" He waved a hand. \"If it\u0027s secrets you\u0027re worried about, please don\u0027t worry. Jewelers are used to them. Scotland Yard will probably give my firm a clean bill in that respect. Heaven knows we\u0027ve had enough to do with them over the years.\"\n \"And if I told you that I\u0027m from the Ministry of Defense?\"\n \"Same thing,\" said Mr. Snowman. \"You can naturally rely absolutely on my discretion!\"\n Bond made up his mind. \"All right. Well, all this comes under the Official Secrets Act, of course. We suspect that the underbidder, presumably to you, will be a Soviet Agent. My job is to establish his identity. Can\u0027t tell you any more, I\u0027m afraid. And you don\u0027t actually need to know any more. All I want is to go with you to Sotheby\u0027s tomorrow night and for you to help me spot the man. No medals, I\u0027m afraid, but we\u0027d be extremely grateful.\"\n Mr. Kenneth Snowman\u0027s eyes glinted with enthusiasm. \"Of course. Delighted to help in any way. But,\" he looked doubtful, \"you know it\u0027s not necessarily going to be all that easy. Peter Wilson, the head of Sotheby\u0027s, who\u0027ll be taking the sale, would be the only person who could tell us for sure—that is, if the bidder wants to stay secret. There are dozens of ways of bidding without making any movement at all. But if the bidder fixes his method, his code so to speak, with Peter Wilson before the sale, Peter wouldn\u0027t think of letting anyone in on the code. It would give the bidder\u0027s game away to reveal his limit. And that\u0027s a close secret, as you can imagine, in the rooms. And a thousand times not if you come with me. I shall probably be setting the pace. I already know how far I\u0027m going to go—for a client by the way—but it would make my job vastly easier if I could tell how far the underbidder\u0027s going to go. As it is, what you\u0027ve told me has been a great help. I shall warn my man to put his sights even higher. If this chap of yours has got a strong nerve, he may push me very hard indeed. And there will be others in the field of course. It sounds as if this is going to be quite a night. They\u0027re putting it on television and asking all the millionaires and dukes and duchesses for the sort of gala performance Sotheby\u0027s do rather well. Wonderful publicity of course. By jove, if they knew there was cloak-and-dagger stuff mixed up with the sale, there\u0027d be a riot! Now then, is there anything else to go into? Just spot this man and that\u0027s all?\"\n \"That\u0027s all. How much do you think this thing will go for?\"\n Mr. Snowman tapped his teeth with a gold pencil. \"Well now, you see that\u0027s where I have to keep quiet. I know how high I\u0027m going to go, but that\u0027s my client\u0027s secret.\" He paused and looked thoughtful. \"Let\u0027s say that if it goes for less than £100,000 we\u0027ll be surprised.\"\n \"I see,\" said Bond. \"Now then, how do I get into the sale?\"\n Mr. Snowman produced an elegant alligator-skin notecase and extracted two engraved bits of pasteboard. He handed one over. \"That\u0027s my wife\u0027s. I\u0027ll get her one somewhere else in the rooms. B.5—well placed in the center front. I\u0027m B.6.\"\n Bond took the ticket. It said:\n Sotheby \u0026 Co.\n Sale of\n A Casket of Magnificent Jewels\n A Unique Object of Vertu by Carl Fabergé\n The Property of a Lady\n Admit one to the Main Sale Room\n Tuesday, 20 June, at 9.30 pm precisely\n ENTRANCE IN ST. GEORGE STREET\n \"It\u0027s not the old Georgian entrance in Bond Street,\" commented Mr. Snowman. \"They have an awning and red carpet out from their back door now that Bond Street\u0027s one way. Now,\" he got up from his chair, \"would you care to see some Fabergé? We\u0027ve got some pieces here my father bought from the Kremlin around 1927. It\u0027ll give you some idea what all the fuss is about, though of course the Emerald Sphere\u0027s incomparably finer than anything I can show you by Fabergé apart from the Imperial Easter Eggs.\"\n Later, dazzled by the diamonds, the multicolored gold, the silken sheen of translucent enamels, James Bond walked up and out of the Aladdin\u0027s Cave under Regent Street and went off to spend the rest of the day in drab offices around Whitehall planning drearily minute arrangements for the identification and photographing of a man in a crowded room who did not yet possess a face or an identity but who was certainly the top Soviet spy in London.\n Through the next day, Bond\u0027s excitement mounted. He found an excuse to go into the Communications Section and wander into the little room where Miss Maria Freudenstein and two assistants were working the cipher machines that handled the Purple Cipher dispatches. He picked up the en clair file—he had freedom of access to most material at headquarters—and ran his eye down the carefully edited paragraphs that, in half an hour to so, would be spiked, unread, by some junior C.I.A. clerk in Washington and, in Moscow, be handed, with reverence, to a top-ranking officer of the KGB. He joked with the two junior girls, but Maria Freudenstein only looked up from her machine to give him a polite smile and Bond\u0027s skin crawled minutely at this proximity to treachery and at the black and deadly secret locked up beneath the frilly white blouse. She was an unattractive girl with a pale, rather pimply skin, black hair and a vaguely unwashed appearance. Such a girl would be unloved, make few friends, have chips on her shoulder—more particularly in view of her illegitimacy—and a grouse against society. Perhaps her only pleasure in life was the triumphant secret she harbored La that flattish bosom—the knowledge that she was cleverer than all those around her, that she was, every day, hitting back against the world—the world that despised, or just ignored her, because of her plainness—with all her might. One day they\u0027d be sorry! It was a common neurotic pattern—the revenge of the ugly duckling on society.\n Bond wandered off down the corridor to his own office. By tonight that girl would have made a fortune, been paid her thirty pieces of silver a thousandfold. Perhaps the money would change her character, bring her happiness. She would be able to afford the best beauty specialists, the best clothes, a pretty flat. But M. had said he was now going to hot up the Purple Cipher Operation, try a more dangerous level of deception. This would be dicey work. One false step, one incautious lie, an ascertainable falsehood in a message, and the KGB would smell a rat. Once more, and they would know they were being hoaxed and probably had been ignominiously hoaxed for three years. Such a shameful revelation would bring quick revenge. It would be assumed that Maria Freudenstein had been acting as a double agent, working for the British as well as the Russians. She would inevitably and quickly be liquidated—perhaps with the cyanide pistol Bond had been reading about only the day before.\n James Bond, looking out of the window across the trees in Regent\u0027s Park, shrugged. Thank God it was none of his business. The girl\u0027s fate wasn\u0027t in his hands. She was caught in the grimy machine of espionage and she would be lucky if she lived to spend a tenth of the fortune she was going to gain in a few hours in the auction rooms.\n There was a line of cars and taxis blocking George Street behind Sotheby\u0027s. Bond paid off his taxi and joined the crowd filtering under the awning and up the steps. He was handed a catalog by the uniformed Commissionaire who inspected his ticket, and went up the broad stairs with the fashionable, excited crowd and along a gallery and into the main auction room that was already thronged. He found his seat next to Mr. Snowman, who was writing figures on a pad on his knee, and looked round him.\n The lofty room was perhaps as large as a tennis court. It had the took and the smell of age and the two large chandeliers, to fit in with the period, blazed warmly in contrast to the strip lighting along the vaulted ceiling whose glass roof was partly obscured by a blind, still half-drawn against the sun that would have been blazing down on the afternoon\u0027s sale. Miscellaneous pictures and tapestries hung on the olive-green walls and batteries of television and other cameras (amongst them the M.I.5 cameraman with a press pass from The Sunday Times) were clustered with their handlers on a platform built out from the middle of a giant tapestried hunting scene. There were perhaps a hundred dealers and spectators sitting attentively on small gilt chairs. All eyes were focused on the slim, good-looking auctioneer talking quietly from the raised wooden pulpit. He was dressed in an immaculate dinner jacket with a red carnation in the buttonhole. He spoke unemphatically and without gestures.\n \"Fifteen thousand pounds. And sixteen,\" a pause. A glance at someone in the front row. \"Against you, sir.\" The flick of a catalog being raised. \"Seventeen thousand pounds I am bid. Eighteen. Nineteen. I am bid twenty thousand pounds.\" And so the quiet voice went, calmly, unhurriedly on while down among the audience the equally impassive bidders signaled their responses to the litany.\n \"What is he selling?\" asked Bond opening his catalog.\n \"Lot 40,\" said Mr. Snowman. \"That diamond rivière the porter\u0027s holding on the black velvet tray. It\u0027ll probably go for about twenty-five. An Italian is bidding against a couple of Frenchmen. Otherwise they\u0027d have got it for twenty. I only went to fifteen. Liked to have got it. Wonderful stones. But there it is.\"\n Sure enough, the price stuck at twenty-five thousand and the hammer, held by its head and not by its handle, came down with soft authority. \"Yours, sir,\" said Mr. Peter Wilson and a sales clerk hurried down the aisle to confirm the identity of the bidder.\n \"I\u0027m disappointed,\" said Bond.\n Mr. Snowman looked up from his catalog. \"Why is that?\"\n \"I\u0027ve never been to an auction before and I always thought the auctioneer banged his gavel three times and said going, going, gone, so as to give the bidders a last chance.\"\n Mr. Snowman laughed. \"You might still find that operating in the Shires or in Ireland, but it hasn\u0027t been the fashion at London sale rooms since I\u0027ve been attending them.\"\n \"Pity. It adds to the drama.\"\n \"You\u0027ll get plenty of that in a minute. This is the last lot before the curtain goes up.\"\n One of the porters had reverently uncoiled a glittering mass of rubies and diamonds on his black velvet tray. Bond looked at the catalog. It said \"Lot 41\" which the luscious prose described as:\n A PAIR OF FINE AND IMPORTANT RUBY AND DIAMOND BRACELETS, the front of each in the form of an elliptical cluster composed of one larger and two smaller rubies within a border of cushioned-shaped diamonds, the sides and back formed of simpler clusters alternating with diamond openwork scroll motifs springing from single-stone ruby centers millegriffe-set in gold, running between chains of rubies and diamonds linked alternately, the clasp also in the form of an elliptical cluster. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/octopussy-the-living-daylights-james-bond-14/page-12.html","bookId":1556,"book":{"id":1556,"title":"Octopussy \u0026 the Living Daylights (James Bond #14)","description":"Storyline: \n Octopussy \u0026 the Living Daylights (James Bond (Original Series) #14) \n Whether it is tracking down a wayward major who has taken a deadly secret with him to the Caribbean or identifying a top Russian agent secretly bidding for a Fabergé egg in a Sotheby’s auction room, Bond always closes the case—with extreme prejudice.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/octopussy-the-living-daylights-james-bond-14.jpg","author":"Ian Fleming","type":"Adventure","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/octopussy-the-living-daylights-james-bond-14.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:18:42 PM"}}
