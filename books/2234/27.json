{"id":108016,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"SEVENTY-SIX\n MALONE GLANCED DOWN AT THE ROUGH TERRAIN, A MIXTURE OF parched earth, greenlands, rolling hills, and trees. Viktor piloted the chopper, a Hind, which had been parked on a concrete pad a few miles from the palace. He knew the craft. Russian made, twin top-mounted turboshaft engines driving a main and tail rotors. The Soviets called it a flying tank. NATO dubbed the mean-looking thing the Crocodile, due to its camouflage color and distinct fuselage. All in all a formidable gunship, this one modified with a large rear compartment for low-capacity troop transport. Thankfully, they\u0027d managed to leave both the palace and Samarkand with no problems.\n \"Where\u0027d you learn to fly?\" he asked Viktor.\n \"Bosnia. Croatia. That\u0027s what I did in the military. Search and destroy.\"\n \"Good place to build your nerves.\"\n \"And get killed.\"\n He couldn\u0027t argue with that.\n \"How far?\" Cassiopeia asked through the headset.\n They were flying east, at nearly three hundred kilometers an hour, toward Ely\u0027s cabin in the Pamirs. Zovastina would soon be free, if not already, so he asked, \"What about anyone coming after us?\"\n Viktor motioned ahead. \"Those mountains will give us cover. Tough to track anything in there. We\u0027ll be into them shortly, and we\u0027re only minutes from the Chinese border. We can always escape there.\"\n \"Don\u0027t act like you didn\u0027t hear me,\" Cassiopeia said. \"How far?\"\n Malone had intentionally avoided answering. She was anxious. He wanted to tell her he knew she was sick. Let her know somebody cared. That he understood her frustration. But he knew better. Instead, he said, \"We\u0027re moving as fast as we can.\" He paused. \"But this is probably better than being tied to trees.\"\n \"I assume I\u0027ll never live that one down.\"\n \"Something like that.\"\n \"Okay, Cotton, I\u0027m a little upset. But you have to understand, I thought Ely was dead. I wanted him to be alive, but I knew-I thought-\" She caught herself. \"And now-\"\n He turned and saw excitement in her eyes, which both energized and saddened him. Then he caught himself and finished her thought, \"And now he\u0027s with Stephanie and Henrik. So calm down.\"\n She was seated alone in the rear compartment. He saw her tap Viktor on the shoulder. \"Did you know about Ely being alive?\"\n Viktor shook his head. \"I was taunting you on the boat in Venice when I told you he was dead. I had to say something. Truth is, I\u0027m the one who saved Ely. Zovastina thought someone might move on him. He was her adviser and political murder is commonplace in the Federation. She wanted Ely protected. After that attempt on his life, she hid him. I haven\u0027t had anything to do with him since. Though I was head of the guard, she was in charge. So I really don\u0027t know what happened to him. I learned not to ask questions, just do what she said.\"\n Malone caught the past tense observation concerning Viktor\u0027s job status. \"She\u0027ll kill you if she finds you.\"\n \"I knew the rules before all this started.\"\n They continued flying smooth and straight. He\u0027d never flown in a Hind. Its instrumentation was impressive, as was its firepower. Guided missiles. Multibarrel machine guns. Twin cannon pods.\n \"Cotton,\" Cassiopeia said, \"do you have a way of communicating with Stephanie?\"\n Not a question he wanted to answer at the moment, but he had no choice. \"I do.\"\n \"Give it to me.\"\n He found the world phone-Magellan Billet-issue, provided by Stephanie in Venice-and dialed the number, slipping off his headset. A few seconds were needed before a pulsating buzz confirmed a connection and Stephanie\u0027s voice greeted him.\n \"We\u0027re headed your way,\" he said.\n \"We left the cabin,\" she said. \"We\u0027re driving south on a highway marked M45 to what was once Mt. Klimax. Ely knows where it is. He says the locals call the place Arima.\"\n \"Tell me more.\"\n He listened, then repeated the information to Viktor, who nodded. \"I know where that is.\"\n Viktor banked the copter southeast and increased speed.\n \"We\u0027re on our way,\" he told Stephanie. \"Everyone here is fine.\"\n He saw that Cassiopeia wanted the phone, but that wasn\u0027t going to happen. He motioned no with his head, hoping she\u0027d understand that now was not the time. But to comfort her, he asked Stephanie, \"Ely okay?\"\n \"Yeah, but anxious.\"\n \"I know what you mean. We\u0027ll be there before you. I\u0027ll call. We can do some aerial recon until you get there.\"\n \"Viktor any help?\"\n \"Wouldn\u0027t be here now if it wasn\u0027t for him.\"\n He clicked off the phone and told Cassiopeia where Ely was headed.\n An alarm sounded in the cabin.\n His gaze found the radar display that indicated two targets approaching from the west.\n \"Black Sharks,\" Viktor said, \"coming straight for us.\"\n Malone knew those choppers, too. NATO called them Hokums. KA-50s. Fast, efficient, loaded with guided missiles and 30mm cannons. He saw that Viktor also realized the threat.\n \"They found us quick,\" Malone said.\n \"There\u0027s a base near here.\"\n \"What do you plan to do?\"\n They started to climb, gaining altitude, changing course. Six thousand feet. Seven. Nine. Leveling at ten.\n \"You know how to use the guns?\" Viktor asked.\n He was sitting in the weapons officer\u0027s seat, so he scanned the instrument panel. Luckily, he could read Russian. \"I can manage.\"\n \"Then get ready for a fight.\"\n SEVENTY-SEVEN\n SAMARKAND\n ZOVASTINA WATCHED AS HER GENERALS CONSIDERED THE WAR plan. The men sitting around the conference table were her most trusted subordinates, though she tempered that trust with a realization that one or more of them could be a traitor. After the past twenty-four hours she could not be sure of anything. These men had all been with her from the beginning, rising as she rose, steadily building the Federation\u0027s offensive strength, readying themselves for what was about to come.\n \"We\u0027ll take Iran first,\" she declared.\n She knew the calculations. The current population of Pakistan was a hundred and seventy million. Afghanistan, thirty-two million. Iran, sixty-eight million. All three were targets. Originally, she\u0027d planned a simultaneous assault, now she believed a strategic strike better. If infection points were chosen with care, places of maximum density, and the viruses planted with skill, the computer models predicted a population reduction of seventy percent or more would occur within fourteen days. She told the men what they already knew, then added, \"We need a total panic. A crisis. The Iranians have to want our assistance. What do you have planned?\"\n \"We\u0027ll start with their military forces and government,\" one of the generals said. \"Most of the viral agents work in less than forty-eight hours. But we\u0027ll vary which ones we use. They\u0027ll identify a virus fairly quickly, but then they\u0027ll have another to deal with. That should keep them off guard and prevent any productive medical response.\"\n She\u0027d been concerned on that point, but not anymore. \"The scientists tell me the viruses have all been modified, making their detection and prevention even more difficult.\"\n Eight men surrounded the table, all from her army and air force. Central Asia had long languished between China, the USSR, India, and the Middle East, not part of any of them, but desired by all. The Great Game had played itself out here two centuries ago when Russia and Britain battled each other for dominance, neither caring what the native populations wanted.\n Not anymore.\n Central Asia now spoke with unity through a democratically elected parliament, ministers, elections, courts, and a rule of law.\n One voice.\n Hers.\n \"What of the Europeans and the Americans?\" a general asked. \"How will they react to our aggression?\"\n \"That\u0027s what it cannot be,\" she made clear. \"No aggression. We\u0027ll simply occupy and extend aid and relief to the embattled populations. They\u0027ll be far too busy burying the dead to worry about us.\"\n She\u0027d learned from history. The world\u0027s most successful conquerors-the Greeks, Mongols, Huns, Romans, and Ottomans-all practiced tolerance over the lands they claimed. Hitler could have changed the course of World War II if he\u0027d simply enlisted the aid of millions of Ukrainians, who hated the Soviets, instead of annihilating them. Her forces would enter Iran as savior, not oppressor, knowing that by the time her viruses finished there\u0027d be no opposition left to challenge her. Then she\u0027d annex the land. Repopulate. Move people from the Soviet-ruined regions of her nation into new locales. Blend the races. Do precisely what Alexander the Great had done with his Hellenistic revolution, only in reverse, migrating east to west.\n \"Can we be sure the Americans will not intervene?\" one of the generals asked.\n She understood the apprehension. \"The Americans will not say or do a thing. Why will they care? After the Iraqi debacle, they won\u0027t interfere, especially if we\u0027re handling the load. They\u0027ll actually be thrilled at the prospect of eliminating Iran.\"\n \"Once we move on Afghanistan, there\u0027ll be American deaths,\" one of the men noted. \"Their military is still present.\"\n \"When that time comes, let\u0027s try to minimize those,\" she said. \"We want the end result to be that the Americans withdraw from the country as we take control. I\u0027m assuming that will be a popular decision in the United States. Use a virus there that\u0027s containable. Strategic infections, targeted at specific groups and regions. The majority of the dead must be natives, especially Taliban, make sure U.S. personnel are only a consequence.\"\n She met the gaze of each of the men at the table. Not one of them said a word about the bruise on her face-leftover from her bout with Cassiopeia Vitt. Was her leak here? How had the Americans learned so much about her intentions?\n \"Millions are about to die,\" one of the men said in a whisper.\n \"Millions of problems,\" she made clear. \"Iran is a harbinger of terrorists. A place governed by fools. That\u0027s what the West says over and over. Time to end that problem, and we have the way. The people who survive will be better off. We will, too. We\u0027ll have their oil and their gratitude. What we do with those will determine our success.\"\n She listened as troop strengths, contingency plans, and strategies were discussed. Squads of men had been trained in deploying the viruses and were ready to move south. She was pleased. Years of anticipation were finally over. She imagined how Alexander the Great must have felt when he crossed from Greece into Asia and began his global conquest. Like him, she, too, envisioned total success. Once she controlled Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, she\u0027d move on to the rest of the Middle East. That dominance, though, would be more subtle, the viral rampages made to appear as simply a spread of the initial infections. If she\u0027d read the West correctly, Europe, China, Russia, and America would withdraw into themselves. Restrict their borders. Minimize travel. Hope the public health disaster was contained in countries that, by and large, none of them cared about. Their inaction would give her time to claim more links in the chain of nations that stood between the Federation and Africa. Played right, she could conquer the entire Middle East in a matter of months and never fire a shot.\n \"Do we have control of the antiagents?\" her chief of staff finally asked.\n She\u0027d been waiting for the question. \"We will.\" The uneasy peace that connected her and Vincenti was about to end.\n \"Philogen has not provided stockpiles to treat our population,\" one of the men noted. \"Nor do we have the quantities needed to stop the viral spread in the target nations, once victory is assured.\"\n \"I\u0027m aware of the problem,\" she said.\n A chopper was waiting.\n She stood. \"Gentlemen, we\u0027re about to start the greatest conquest since ancient times. The Greeks came and defeated us, ushering in the Hellenistic Age, which eventually molded Western civilization. We will now begin a new dawn in human development. The Asiatic Age.\"\n SEVENTY-EIGHT\n CASSIOPEIA STRAPPED HERSELF ONTO THE STEEL BENCH IN THE rear compartment. The chopper lurched as Viktor began evasive maneuvers to elude their pursuers. She knew Malone was aware that she\u0027d wanted to talk to Ely, but she also saw that now was not the time. She appreciated Malone risking his neck. How would she have escaped from Zovastina without him? Doubtful that she would have, even with Viktor there. Thorvaldsen had told her that Viktor was an ally, but he\u0027d also warned about his limitations. His mission was to remain undetected, but apparently that directive had changed.\n \"They\u0027re firing,\" Viktor said through the headset.\n The chopper banked left, knifing through the air. Her harness held her secure against the bulkhead. Her hands gripped the bench. She was fighting a rising nausea since, truth be told, she was prone to motion sickness. Boats she generally avoided and planes, as long as they flew straight, weren\u0027t a problem. This, though, was a problem. Her stomach seemed to roll up into her throat as they constantly changed altitude, like an elevator out of control. Nothing she could do but hold on and hope to heaven Viktor knew what he was doing.\n She saw Malone work the firing controls and heard cannon shots from both sides of the fuselage. She gazed ahead into the cockpit, through the windshield, and spotted mountain haunches lurching from the clouds on both sides.\n \"They still back there?\" Malone asked.\n \"Coming fast,\" Viktor said. \"And trying to fire.\"\n \"Missiles we don\u0027t need.\"\n \"I agree. But firing those in here would be tricky for us and them.\"\n They emerged into clearer skies. The helicopter angled right and plummeted in altitude.\n \"Do we have to do that?\" she asked, trying to keep her stomach under control.\n \"Afraid so,\" Malone answered. \"We need to use these valleys to avoid them. In and out, like a maze.\"\n She knew Malone had once flown fighter jets and still held a pilot\u0027s license. \"Some of us don\u0027t like this kind of thing.\"\n \"You\u0027re welcome to toss your cookies anytime.\"\n \"I wouldn\u0027t give you the pleasure.\" Thank goodness she hadn\u0027t eaten since lunch yesterday on Torcello.\n More sharp banks as they roared through the afternoon sky. The engine noise seemed deafening. She\u0027d only flown on a few helicopters, never in a combat situation, the ride like a three dimensional roller coaster.\n \"Two more choppers within radar range,\" Viktor said. \"But they\u0027re off to our north.\"\n \"Where are we headed?\" Malone asked.\n The copter veered into another steep turn.\n \"South,\" Viktor said.\n MALONE STARED AT THE RADAR MONITOR. THE MOUNTAINS WERE both a shield and a problem that compounded tracking their pursuers. The targets steadily winked in and out. The American military relied more on satellites and AWACS planes to provide a clear picture. Luckily, the Central Asian Federation did not enjoy those high-tech amenities.\n The radar screen cleared.\n \"Nothing behind us,\" Malone said.\n He had to admit, Viktor could fly. They were winding a path through the Pamirs, rotors dangerously close to steep gray precipices. He\u0027d never learned to fly a helicopter, though he\u0027d always wanted to, and he\u0027d not been behind the controls of a supersonic fighter in ten years. He\u0027d maintained his jet fighter proficiency for a few years after transferring to the Billet, but he\u0027d let the certification slide. At the time he hadn\u0027t minded. Now he wished he\u0027d kept those skills current.\n Viktor leveled the chopper off at six thousand feet and asked, \"You hit anything?\"\n \"Hard to say. I think we just forced them to keep their distance.\"\n \"Where we\u0027re headed is about a hundred and fifty kilometers south. I know Arima. I\u0027ve been there before, but it\u0027s been a while.\"\n \"Mountains all the way?\"\n Viktor nodded. \"And more valleys. I think I can stay beneath any radar. This area is not a security zone. The border with China has been open for years. Most of Zovastina\u0027s resources are directed to the south, on the Afghan and Pakistani lines.\"\n Cassiopeia came up behind them. \"That over?\"\n \"Looks like it.\"\n \"I\u0027m going to take a roundabout way,\" Viktor said, \"to avoid any more encounters. It\u0027ll take a little longer, but the farther east I go the safer we\u0027ll be.\"\n \"How long will that slow us up?\" Cassiopeia asked.\n \"Maybe a half hour.\"\n Malone nodded and Cassiopeia did not offer any objections. Dodging bullets was one thing, but air-to-air missiles were another matter. Soviet offensive equipment, like their missiles, were top-notch. Viktor\u0027s suggestion was a good one.\n Malone settled into his seat and watched the naked rush of rounded spurs. In the distance, haze claimed a stadium of white-tipped peaks. A river cleaved purple veins through the foothills in a silty torrent. Both Alexander the Great and Marco Polo had walked that sooty earth-the whole place once a battleground. British dependencies to the south, Russian to the north, and the Chinese and Afghans to the east and west. For most of the twentieth century, Moscow and Peking fought for control, each testing the other, ultimately settling into an uneasy peace, only the Pamirs themselves emerging a victor.\n Alexander the Great chose his last resting place wisely.\n But he wondered.\n Was he really down there?\n Waiting?\n SEVENTY-NINE\n 2:00 P.M.\n ZOVASTINA FLEW FROM SAMARKAND TO VINCENTI\u0027S ESTATE IN A direct path aboard the fastest helicopter her air force owned.\n Vincenti\u0027s house loomed below. Excessive, expensive, and, like its owner, expendable. Allowing capitalism to flourish within the Federation may not be a smart idea. Changes would be needed. The Venetian League would have to be reined in.\n But first things first.\n The chopper touched down.\n After Edwin Davis left the palace, she\u0027d ordered Kamil Revin to contact Vincenti and alert him of the visit. But the warning had been delayed long enough to allow her troops time to arrive. She\u0027d been told that the house was now secure, so she\u0027d ordered her men to leave in the choppers that had brought them, save for nine soldiers. The house staff had also been evacuated. She possessed no quarrel with locals who were only trying to earn a living-her dispute was with Vincenti.\n She stepped from the helicopter and marched across manicured grounds to a stone terrace where she entered the mansion. Though Vincenti thought she was disinterested in the estate, she\u0027d closely followed its construction. Fifty-three rooms. Eleven bedrooms. Sixteen baths. Its architect had willingly provided her a set of plans. She knew of the regal dining hall, elaborate parlors, gourmet kitchen, and wine cellar. Staring firsthand at the decor it was easy to see why it carried an eight-figure price tag.\n In the main foyer two of her troops guarded the front entrance. Two more men flanked a marble stairway. Everything here reminded her of Venice. And she\u0027d never liked to recall failure.\n She caught the attention of one of the sentinels, who motioned right with his rifle. She paraded down a short hall and entered what appeared to be a library. Three more armed men occupied the room along with another man. Though they\u0027d never met, she knew his name and background.\n \"Mr. O\u0027Conner, you have a decision to make.\"\n The man stood from a leather settee and faced her.\n \"You\u0027ve worked for Vincenti a long time. He depends on you. And, frankly, without you he may not have made it so far.\"\n She allowed her compliment to be absorbed as she inspected the opulent room. \"Vincenti lives well. I\u0027m curious, does he share the wealth with you?\"\n O\u0027Conner said nothing.\n \"Let me tell you some things you may or may not know. Last year, Vincenti netted over forty million euros from his company. He owns stock worth over a billion euros. What does he pay you?\"\n No answer.\n \"One hundred fifty thousand euros.\" She saw the look on his face as the truth sank in. \"You see, Mr. O\u0027Conner, I know quite a lot. One hundred fifty thousand euros for all that you do for him. You\u0027ve intimidated, coerced, even killed. He makes tens of millions and you received one hundred and fifty thousand euros. He lives like this and you,\" she hesitated, \"simply live.\"\n \"I\u0027ve never complained,\" O\u0027Conner said.\n She stopped behind Vincenti\u0027s desk. \"No. You haven\u0027t. Which is admirable.\"\n \"What do you want?\"\n \"Where\u0027s Vincenti?\"\n \"Gone. Left before your men arrived.\"\n She grinned. \"There it is. Another thing you do so well. Lie.\"\n He shrugged. \"Believe what you will. Surely your men have searched the house.\"\n \"They have and, you\u0027re right, Vincenti is not to be found. But you and I both know why that\u0027s so.\"\n She noticed the lovely alabaster carvings that dotted the desk. Chinese figurines. She never really cared for Oriental art. She lifted one of the figurines. A contorted fat man, half-dressed. \"During the construction of this obscene monstrosity, Vincenti incorporated back passages, ostensibly for servants\u0027 use, but you and I know what they\u0027re really used for. He also had a large underground room hewn from the rock beneath us. That\u0027s probably where he is right now.\"\n O\u0027Conner\u0027s face never flinched.\n \"So, as I said, Mr. O\u0027Conner, you have a choice. I\u0027ll find Vincenti, with or without your assistance. But your aid will speed the process and, I must admit, time is of the essence. That\u0027s why I\u0027m willing to bargain. I could use a man like you. Resourceful.\" She paused. \"Without greed. So here\u0027s your choice. Do you switch sides or stay with Vincenti?\"\n She\u0027d offered the same alternative to others. Most were members of the national assembly, part of her government, or a rising opposition. Some weren\u0027t worth recruiting, far easier to kill them and be done with it, but the majority had proven worthy converts. They\u0027d all been either Asian or Russian or some combination. Here, she was dangling bait to an American and was curious how the lure would be received.\n \"I choose you,\" O\u0027Conner said. \"What can I do for you?\"\n \"Answer my question.\"\n O\u0027Conner reached into his pocket and one of the troops instantly leveled a rifle. O\u0027Conner quickly displayed empty hands. \"I need something to answer your question.\"\n \"Go ahead,\" she said.\n He retrieved a silver controller with three buttons. \"Those rooms are accessed from doors throughout the house. But the underground room can only be entered from here.\" He displayed the device. \"One button opens every portal in case of a fire. The other activates the alarm. The third button,\" he pointed across the room and pressed, \"opens that.\"\n An eloquent Chinese cabinet rotated, revealing a dimly lit passage.\n The warmth of victory filled her.\n She approached one of her infantrymen and unholstered his Makarov 9mm.\n She then turned and shot O\u0027Conner in the head.\n \"Loyalty that shallow I don\u0027t need.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-venetian-betrayal-cotton-malone-3/page-27.html","bookId":2234,"book":{"id":2234,"title":"The Venetian Betrayal (Cotton Malone #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The Venetian Betrayal (Cotton Malone #3) \n Cotton Malone is back and the stakes were never higher: a deadly virus that could wipe out civilisation as we know it - and a cure that lies buried in the past.
