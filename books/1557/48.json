{"id":108526,"no":48,"title":"Page 48","content":"ADAM YATES TRIED to maintain his cool. They were back outside now, on the Friedmans\u0027 front lawn. That had been much too close a call. When that Friedman cuckoo had started yammering about never ever telling, well, it could have ended right there- Yates\u0027s career, his marriage, even his freedom. Everything. Yates needed to take control. He waited until he and Loren Muse were back in the car. Then, calmly as he could, Yates asked, \"So what was that all about?\" \"Candace Potter is still alive,\" Muse said. \"Pardon me?\" \"She\u0027s alive and well and married to Matt Hunter.\" Yates listened to Loren\u0027s explanation. He felt his insides tremor. When she finished he asked to see the autopsy. She handed it to him. \"No photos of the victim?\" \"It\u0027s not the whole file,\" Loren said. \"It\u0027s just the pages that concerned Max Darrow. My guess is he somehow learned the truth- that Candace Potter hadn\u0027t been killed all these years ago. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that the real victim was an AIS female.\" \"Why would Darrow have checked that now? I mean, after ten years?\" \"I don\u0027t know. But we need to talk to Olivia Hunter.\" Adam Yates nodded, trying to take this in. It was impossible for him to fathom. Olivia Hunter was the dead stripper named Candace Potter. Candi Cane. She had been there that night, he was sure of it. It was likely now, very likely, that Olivia Hunter had the videotape. That meant he had to take Loren Muse out of the equation. Right now. Yates glanced at the autopsy report again. Muse drove. The height, weight, and hair color matched, but the truth seemed obvious now. The real victim had been Cassandra Meadows. She\u0027d been dead all along. He should have figured that. She wouldn\u0027t have been smart enough to vanish. Len Friedman had been right when he talked about the honor of thieves. Yates had counted on that, he guessed, which in hindsight was beyond stupid. People in that business respect confidentiality not out of any sense of honor but because of profit. If you get a reputation for talking, you lose your clientele. Simple as that. The only thing was, Clyde Rangor and Emma Lemay had found a way to make even more money. Ergo the \"honor of thieves\" nonsense went right out the window. Yates didn\u0027t do it a lot, but over the years, he\u0027d cheated on Bess. Yates never really considered it a big deal. It was beyond compartmentalizing- beyond the usual \"sex was one thing, making love another.\" Sex with Bess was fine. Even after all these years. But a man needs more. Check all the history books- that one is a given. No great men were sexually monogamous. It was as simple and as complicated as that. And in truth there was nothing wrong with it. Do wives really get upset if their husband occasionally watches, for example, an X-rated film? Was that a crime? An act worthy of divorce? A betrayal? Of course not. Hiring a prostitute was really no different. A man might use pictures or 900-lines or whatever as outside stimuli. That was all this was. Many wives understood this. Yates might even be able to explain it to Bess. If that was all it had been. Rangor and Lemay- they should rot in hell. Yates had been looking for Rangor, Lemay, Cassandra, and that damn tape for ten years. Now there was a twist. At least two of them were dead. And Candace Potter was suddenly in the mix. What did she know? He cleared his throat and looked at Loren Muse. First step: Remove her from the case. So how to handle this...? \"You said you knew Matt Hunter?\" \"Yes.\" \"You shouldn\u0027t do the interview with his wife then.\" Loren frowned. \"Because I used to know him?\" \"Yes.\" \"That was in elementary school, Adam. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve spoken to him since we were ten.\" \"Still. There\u0027s a connection.\" \"So?\" \"So the defense can use it.\" \"How?\" Yates shook his head. \"What?\" \"You seem like a decent investigator, Muse. But every once in a while, your naivete is absolutely startling.\" Her grip on the wheel tightened. He knew that his words had stung. \"Go back to the office,\" he said. \"Cal and I will take over this part of the investigation.\" \"Cal? Was he that lug in Joan Thurston\u0027s office this morning?\" \"He\u0027s a damn good agent.\" \"I\u0027m sure.\" They fell into silence. Loren was trying to think of a way out of this. Yates waited, knowing how to work this now. \"Look, I know the way,\" Loren said. \"I\u0027ll drive you to Hunter\u0027s house and stay outside in case-\" \"No.\" \"But I want-\" \"Want?\" Yates cut her off. \"Who do you think you\u0027re talking to, Investigator Muse?\" She fumed in silence. \"This is now a federal investigation. Most of this case, in fact, seems to lead back to Nevada. Either way it clearly crosses state lines and certainly pissant county lines. You\u0027re a county investigator. You get that? There\u0027s county, then state, then federal. I\u0027ll demonstrate this with a bar graph, if you\u0027d like. But you don\u0027t give the orders here. I do. You\u0027ll go back to your office and if I deem it appropriate, I\u0027ll keep you informed of what is occurring in my investigation. Do I make myself clear?\" Loren fought to keep her voice steady. \"You wouldn\u0027t even know about Olivia Hunter being Candace Potter if it wasn\u0027t for me.\" \"Oh, I see. Is that what this is about, Muse? Your ego? You want the credit? Fine, it\u0027s yours. I\u0027ll put a gold star next to your name on the board, if you like.\" \"That\u0027s not what I meant.\" \"That\u0027s sure as hell how it sounded to me. Naive and a glory hound. Quite a winning combination.\" \"That\u0027s not fair.\" \"That\u0027s not...\" Yates laughed. \"Are you kidding me? Fair? How old are you, Muse, twelve? This is a federal investigation into murder and racketeering and you\u0027re worried about my playing fair with a lowly county investigator? You\u0027ll drive me back to your office immediately and\"- enough stick, a little carrot-\"if you want to participate in this investigation, your current assignment will be to find out anything you can on that other whore, the black one she roomed with.\" \"Kimmy Dale.\" \"Yes. Find out exactly where she is, what her story is, everything you can. You will not talk to her, however, without talking to me first. If you don\u0027t like it, I\u0027ll have you removed from the case. Understood?\" She responded as if there were nails in her mouth: \"Understood.\" He knew that she would take it. Loren wanted to remain in the loop. She\u0027d settle for marginalized, hoping she\u0027d make it back onto the center stage. Truth was, she was a damn fine investigator. Yates would try to steal her away when this was all over. He\u0027d flatter her and let her have all the credit and then, good as she was, she probably wouldn\u0027t look too closely at the details. At least that was what he hoped. Because so far, those who had died had not been innocent- they\u0027d been trying to hurt him. Loren Muse was different. He really didn\u0027t want her harmed. But as old a philosophy as it was, in the end, if it comes down to us or them, it is always us. Loren Muse pulled the car into the lot and got out without a word. Yates let her huff off. He called Cal Dollinger, the only man he trusted with this sort of information. He quickly explained what he needed to. Cal did not need much detail. Adam flashed on a painful memory- the hospital when Sam had meningitis. What he left out of the story he\u0027d told Loren was Cal\u0027s part in the nightmare. Cal, too, had refused to leave the hospital. Adam\u0027s oldest friend had pulled up a stiff metal chair and stayed outside Sam\u0027s door for three straight days, not saying a word, just sitting there on guard, making certain that if Adam needed anything, he\u0027d be ready. \"You want me to go alone?\" Cal asked. \"No, I\u0027ll meet you at the Hunters\u0027 house,\" Yates said, his voice soft. \"We\u0027ll get the tape. Then we end this.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-innocent/page-48.html","bookId":1557,"book":{"id":1557,"title":"The Innocent","description":"Storyline: You never meant to kill him….
