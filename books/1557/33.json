Olivia\u0027s was at the Howard Johnson\u0027s. They called a taxi and waited outside by the entrance. Matt sat in a wheelchair. Olivia stood next to him. She looked straight forward, not at him. It was hot and sticky, but Olivia still stood with her arms wrapped around herself. She wore a sleeveless blouse and khaki pants. Her arms were toned and tan. The taxi pulled up. Matt struggled to his feet. Olivia tried to help, but he waved her off. They both got into the backseat. Their bodies did not touch. They did not hold hands. \"Good evening,\" the driver said, eyes in the rearview. \"Where to?\" The driver was dark-skinned and spoke with some sort of African accent. Matt gave him their address in Irvington. The driver was chatty. He was from Ghana, he told them. He had six children. Two of them lived here with him, the rest were back in Ghana with his wife. Matt tried to be responsive. Olivia stared out her window and said nothing. At one point Matt reached for her hand. She let him take it, but it felt lifeless. \"Did you visit Dr. Haddon?\" Matt asked her. \"Yes.\" \"And?\" \"Everything is fine. It should be a normal pregnancy.\" From the front seat, the driver said, \"Pregnancy? You\u0027re having a baby?\" \"Yes, we are,\" Matt said. \"Is this your first?\" \"Yes.\" \"Such a blessing, my friend.\" \"Thank you.\" They were in Irvington now, on Clinton Avenue. Up ahead the light turned red. The driver cruised to a stop. \"We make a right here, yes?\" Matt had been glancing out the window, preparing to say yes, when something snared his gaze. Their house was indeed down the street on the right. But that wasn\u0027t what had captured his attention. There was a police car parked on the street. \"Hold up a second,\" Matt said. \"Pardon me?\" Matt cranked open the window. The police car\u0027s engine was running. He wondered about that. He looked to the corner. Lawrence the Wino was staggering with his customary brown bag, singing the old Four Tops classic \"Bernadette.\" Matt leaned out the window. \"Hey, Lawrence.\" \"... And never find the love I\u0027ve found in y-\" Lawrence stopped mid-lyric. He cupped his hand over his eyes and squinted. A smile broke out on his face. He stumbled toward them. \"Matt, mah man! Look at you, all fine and fancy in a taxi.\" \"Yep.\" \"You been out drinking, right? I remember from before. Didn\u0027t want to drink and drive, am I right?\" \"Something like that, Lawrence.\" \"Whoa.\" Lawrence pointed to the bandage on Matt\u0027s head. \"What happened to you? You know who you look like, with your head wrapped like that?\" \"Lawrence-\" \"That dude marching in that old picture, the one playing the flute. Or is it the one on the snare? I can never remember. Had his head wrapped, just like you. What was that picture called again?\" Matt tried to get him on track. \"Lawrence, do you see that cop car over there?\" \"What\"- he leaned closer-\"he did that to you?\" \"No, nothing like that. I\u0027m fine, really.\" Lawrence was perfectly positioned to block the car\u0027s view of Matt\u0027s face. If the cop happened to look this way, he\u0027d probably figure Lawrence was panhandling. \"How long has he been parked there?\" Matt asked. \"I don\u0027t know. Fifteen, twenty minutes maybe. Time flies by now, Matt. Older you get, the faster it goes by. You listen to Lawrence.\" \"Has he gotten out of the car?\" \"Who?\" \"The cop.\" \"Oh, sure. Knocked on your door too.\" Lawrence smiled. \"Oh, I see. You in trouble, ain\u0027t you, Matt?\" \"Me? I\u0027m one of the good guys.\" Lawrence loved that one. \"Oh, I know that. You have a good night now, Matt.\" He leaned into the window a little. \"You too, Liv.\" Olivia said, \"Thank you, Lawrence.\" Lawrence saw her face and paused. He looked at Matt and straightened up. His voice grew softer. \"You take care now.\" \"Thanks, Lawrence.\" Matt sat forward and tapped the driver. \"Change of destination.\" The driver said, \"Will I get in trouble for this?\" \"Not at all. I was in an accident. They want to talk to me about how I got hurt. We\u0027d rather wait until morning.\" The driver wasn\u0027t buying it, but he didn\u0027t seem ready to argue either. The light turned green. The taxi started up, heading straight instead of right. \"So where to?\" Matt gave him the address of MVD in Newark. He figured that they could pick up his car and find a place to go and talk. The question was, where? He checked his watch. It was three in the morning. The driver pulled into MVD\u0027s lot. \"This is good, yes?\" \"Fine, thanks.\" They got out of the car. Matt paid the man. Olivia said, \"I\u0027ll drive.\" \"I\u0027m fine.\" \"Right, fine. You just got beaten up and you\u0027re high on meds.\" Olivia put out her palm. \"Give me the keys.\" He did. They got into the car and started out. \"Where are we going?\" Olivia asked. \"I\u0027m going to call Marsha, see if we can crash there.\" \"You\u0027re going to wake up the kids.\" He managed a small smile. \"Grenades in their pillows wouldn\u0027t wake up those two.\" \"And what about Marsha?\" \"She won\u0027t mind.\" But Matt suddenly hesitated. He really didn\u0027t worry about waking Marsha- there had been plenty of late-night calls over the years- but now he wondered if she would be alone tonight, if maybe he wouldn\u0027t be interrupting something. He also- and this was really weird- started worrying about something else right now. Suppose Marsha got remarried. Paul and Ethan were still young. Would they call the guy Daddy? Matt wasn\u0027t sure if he could handle that. More to the point, what role would Uncle Matt have in this new life, this new family? All of this was silly, of course. He was getting way ahead of himself. It was hardly the time either, what with his other problems right now. But the thoughts were there, in his head, knocking to come out of some back closet. He pulled out his cell phone and pushed the second number on his speed dial. As they hit Washington Avenue, Matt noticed two cars going past them in the opposite direction. He turned and watched them pull into the MVD lot. The cars were from the Essex County prosecutor\u0027s office. They were the same make and model Loren had been using earlier in the evening. This couldn\u0027t be good. The phone was picked up on the second ring. Marsha said, \"I\u0027m glad you called.\" If she\u0027d been sleeping, she hid it pretty well. \"Are you alone?\" \"What?\" \"I mean... I know the kids are there-\" \"I\u0027m alone, Matt.\" \"I don\u0027t mean to pry. I just want to make sure I\u0027m not interrupting anything.\" \"You\u0027re not. You never will be.\" That should have set his mind at ease, he guessed. \"Do you mind if Olivia and I crash at your place tonight?\" \"Of course not.\" \"It\u0027s a long story, but basically I was assaulted tonight-\" \"Are you okay?\" The pain was starting to ebb back into his head and ribs. \"I got a few bumps and bruises, but I\u0027ll be fine. Thing is, the police want to ask some questions and we\u0027re just not ready for that yet.\" \"Does this have anything to do with that nun?\" Marsha asked. \"What nun?\" Olivia\u0027s head snapped toward him. \"There was a county investigator here today,\" Marsha said. \"I should have called you, but I guess I was hoping it was no big deal. Hold on, I have her card here someplace...\" Matt\u0027s mind, both exhausted and scrambled, remembered now. \"Loren Muse.\" \"Right, that\u0027s the name. She said a nun made a phone call to the house.\" \"I know,\" he said. \"Muse reached you?\" \"Yes.\" \"I figured she would. We were just talking and then, I don\u0027t know, she spotted your picture on the refrigerator and suddenly she starts asking Kyra and me all these questions about how often you visit.\" \"Don\u0027t worry, I straightened it out. Look, we\u0027ll be there in twenty minutes.\" \"I\u0027ll get the guest room ready.\" \"Don\u0027t go to any trouble.\" \"No trouble. I\u0027ll see you in twenty minutes.\" She hung up. Olivia said, \"What\u0027s this about a nun?\" Matt told her about Loren\u0027s visit. Olivia\u0027s face lost even more color. By the time he finished, they were in Livingston. The roads were completely empty of both cars and pedestrians. There was no one about. The only lights coming from the homes were those downstairs lamps set on timers to fool burglars. Olivia remained silent as she pulled into Marsha\u0027s driveway. Matt could see Marsha\u0027s silhouette through the curtain in the downstairs foyer. The light above the garage was on. Kyra was awake. He saw her look out. Matt slid down the car window and waved up to her. She waved back. Olivia turned off the ignition. Matt checked his face in the visor mirror. He looked like hell. Lawrence was right. What with the bandage wrapped around his head, he did resemble the soldier playing the flute in Willard\u0027s Spirit of \u002776. \"Olivia?\" She said nothing. \"Do you know this Sister Mary Rose?\" \"Maybe.\" She stepped out of the car. Matt did the same. The outside lights- Matt had helped Bernie install the motion detectors- snapped on. Olivia came around to him. She took his hand and held it firmly. \"Before I say anything else,\" she began, \"I need you to know something.\" Matt waited. \"I love you. You are the only man I\u0027ve ever loved. Whatever happens now, you have brought me a happiness and joy I once thought was impossible.\" \"Olivia-\" She put her finger to his lips. \"I just want one thing. I want you to hold me. Hold me right now. Just for a minute or two. Because after I tell you the truth, I\u0027m not sure you will ever want to hold me again.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-innocent/page-33.html","bookId":1557,"book":{"id":1557,"title":"The Innocent","description":"Storyline: You never meant to kill him….
