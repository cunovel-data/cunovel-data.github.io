He almost made a move to come closer, but she put up her hand.\\n\\n \"I saw an old picture of Emma Lemay once,\" Olivia began. \"She was so beautiful. She was smart too. If anyone had the wiles to get out of this life, it was Emma. But you see, no one does. I was eighteen, Matt. And I already felt like my life was over. So there we were, me retching, Emma still holding the gun. She stared down at Clyde for a long time and simply waited for me to catch my breath. It took a few minutes. Then she turns to me, all clear-eyed, and says, \u0027We need to hide his body.\u0027\\n\\n \"I remember shaking my head. I told her I didn\u0027t want any part of that. She didn\u0027t get upset or raise her voice. It was so strange. She looked so... serene.\"\\n\\n Matt said, \"She\u0027d just slain her abuser.\"\\n\\n \"That was part of it, sure.\"\\n\\n \"But?\"\\n\\n \"It was almost as if she\u0027d been waiting for this moment. Like she knew it would one day happen. I said we should call the police. Emma shook her head, calm, in control. The gun was still in her hand. She didn\u0027t point it at me. \u0027We could tell them the truth,\u0027 I said. \u0027That it was self-defense. We\u0027ll show them the bruises on my neck. Hell, we\u0027ll show them Cassandra.\u0027 \"\\n\\n Matt shifted in his seat. Olivia saw it and smiled.\\n\\n \"I know,\" she said. \"The irony isn\u0027t lost on me. Self-defense. Like you claimed. We were both, I guess, at that same fork in the road. Maybe you didn\u0027t have a choice, what with all those people around. But even if you did, you came from a different world. You trusted the police. You thought that truth would win out. But we knew better. Emma had shot Clyde three times, once in the back, twice in the face. No one would buy self-defense. And even if they did, Clyde made big money for his mobbed-up cousin. He\u0027d never let us live.\"\\n\\n \"So what did you do?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"I was confused, I guess. But Emma kept explaining the predicament. We had no choice. Not really. And that was when she hit me with her best argument.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Emma said, \u0027What if it all goes well?\u0027 \"\\n\\n \"What if what all goes well?\" Matt asked.\\n\\n \"What if the police believe us and Clyde\u0027s cousin leaves us alone?\"\\n\\n She stopped, smiled.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t get it,\" Matt said.\\n\\n \"Where would we be? Emma and me. Where would we be if it all worked out?\"\\n\\n Matt saw it now. \"You\u0027d be where you were.\"\\n\\n \"Right. This was our chance, Matt. Clyde had a hundred thousand dollars hidden at the house. Emma said we\u0027d take it. We\u0027d split up and run. We\u0027d start new. Emma already had a destination in mind. She\u0027d been planning on leaving for years, but she never had the courage. Neither did I. Neither did any of us.\"\\n\\n \"But now you had to.\"\\n\\n Olivia nodded. \"She said that if we hid Clyde, they\u0027d figure the two of them ran off together. They\u0027d be looking for a couple. Or they\u0027d think they were both killed and buried together. But she needed my help. I said, \u0027What about me? Clyde\u0027s friends know what I look like. They\u0027ll hunt me down. And how do we explain Cassandra being dead?\u0027\\n\\n \"But Emma already had that covered. She said, \u0027Give me your wallet.\u0027 I dug into my pocket and pulled it out. She took out my ID- back in those days, Nevada didn\u0027t require you to have pictures on the ID- and she jammed it into Cassandra\u0027s pocket. \u0027When is Kimmy coming back?\u0027 she asked me. In three days, I told her. Plenty of time, she said. Then she said, \u0027Listen to me. Neither you nor Cassandra has any real family. Cassandra\u0027s mother threw her out years ago. They don\u0027t talk.\u0027\\n\\n \"I said, \u0027I don\u0027t understand.\u0027\\n\\n \" \u0027I\u0027ve been thinking about this for years,\u0027 Emma said. \u0027Whenever he beat me. Whenever he choked me until I passed out. Whenever he said he was sorry and promised that it would never happen again and that he loved me. Whenever he told me he\u0027d hunt me down and kill me if I ever left. What... what if I killed Clyde and buried him and just took the money and ran someplace I knew was safe? What if I made amends, you know, for what I\u0027d done to you girls? You have those fantasies, don\u0027t you, Candi? About running away?\u0027 \"\\n\\n Matt said, \"And you did.\"\\n\\n Olivia held up her index finger. \"With one difference. I said before that my life already felt over. I disappeared in my books. I tried to keep upbeat. I imagined something different. Because I had something to hold on to. Look, I don\u0027t want to make too much of that night in Vegas. But I thought about it, Matt. I thought about the way you made me feel. I thought about the world you lived in. I remember everything you said- about your family, about where you grew up, about your friends and your school. And what you didn\u0027t know, what you still don\u0027t understand, is that you were describing a place I couldn\u0027t let myself imagine.\"\\n\\n Matt said nothing.\\n\\n \"After you left that night, I can\u0027t tell you how many times I thought of trying to find you.\"\\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n She shook her head. \"You of all people should understand shackles.\"\\n\\n He nodded, afraid to answer.\\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t matter anymore,\" Olivia said. \"It was too late for any of that now. Even with shackles, like you said, we had to act. So we came up with a plan. It was simple, really. First, we rolled Clyde\u0027s body up in a blanket and dumped it in the back of the car. We padlocked the Pen. Emma knew a place. Clyde had dumped at least two bodies there, she said. Out in the desert. We buried him in a shallow grave, way out in this no-man\u0027s-land. Then Emma called the club. She made sure all the girls were made to work overtime, so that none of them would be able to go back to the Pen.\\n\\n \"We stopped at her place to shower. I stepped under the warm water and thought, I don\u0027t know, I thought it would be weird, showering off the blood, like something out of Macbeth.\"\\n\\n A wan smile crossed her face.\\n\\n \"But it wasn\u0027t like that?\" Matt asked.\\n\\n Olivia shook her head slowly. \"I had just buried a man in the desert. At night the jackals would dig him up and feast. Carry his bones away. That\u0027s what Emma told me. And I didn\u0027t care.\"\\n\\n She looked at him as if daring him to challenge her.\\n\\n \"So what did you do next?\"\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t you guess?\"\\n\\n \"Tell me.\"\\n\\n \"I... I mean, Candace Potter was nothing. There was no one to even notify in the event of her untimely death. Emma as her employer and almost guardian called the police. She said that one of her girls had been murdered. The police arrived. Emma showed them Cassandra\u0027s body. The ID was already in her pocket. Emma identified the body and confirmed that it belonged to one of her girls, Candace \u0027Candi Cane\u0027 Potter. There was no next of kin. No one questioned it. Why should they? Why would anyone make something like this up? Emma and I split the money. I got over fifty grand. Can you imagine? All the girls at the club had fake IDs anyway, so getting a new one was no problem for me.\"\\n\\n \"And you just ran off?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"What about Cassandra?\" Matt asked.\\n\\n \"What about her?\"\\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t anyone wonder what happened to her?\"\\n\\n \"We had a million girls come and go. Emma told everyone she\u0027d quit- been spooked off by the murder. Two other girls got scared and ran off too.\"\\n\\n Matt shook his head, trying to wrap his brain around all this. \"When I met you the first time, you used the name Olivia Murray.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"You went back to that name?\"\\n\\n \"That was the only time I used it. With you that night. Did you ever read A Wrinkle in Time?\"\\n\\n \"Sure. In fifth grade, I think.\"\\n\\n \"When I was a kid, it was my favorite book. The protagonist was named Meg Murray. That\u0027s how I came up with the last name.\"\\n\\n \"And Olivia?\"\\n\\n She shrugged. \"It sounded like the direct opposite of Candi.\"\\n\\n \"So then what happened?\"\\n\\n \"Emma and I made a pact. We would never tell anyone the truth- no matter what- because if one of us talked, it could lead to the death of the other. So we swore. I need you to understand how solemnly I made that promise.\"\\n\\n Matt was not sure what to say to that. \"Then you went to Virginia?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Because it was where Olivia Murray lived. It was far away from Vegas or Idaho. I made up a background story. I took courses at the University of Virginia. I didn\u0027t officially attend, of course, but this was in the days before strict security. I just sat in on classes. I hung out in the library and cafeteria. I met people. They just figured I was a student. A few years later, I pretended to graduate. I got a job. I never looked back or thought about Candi. Candace Potter was dead.\"\\n\\n \"And then, what, I came along?\"\\n\\n \"Something like that, yeah. Look, I was a scared kid. I ran away and tried to make a life for myself. A real one. And the truth is, I had no interest in meeting a man. You hired DataBetter, remember?\"\\n\\n Matt nodded. \"I do.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d had enough of that in my life. But then I saw you and... I don\u0027t know. Maybe I wanted to go back to the night we met. To some silly dream. You scoff at the idea of living out here, Matt. You don\u0027t see that this place, this town, this is the best possible world.\"\\n\\n \"And that\u0027s why you want to move out here?\"\\n\\n \"With you,\" she said, her eyes imploring. \"Don\u0027t you see? I never bought that soul-mate stuff. You see what I\u0027ve seen and... but maybe, I don\u0027t know, maybe our wounds work for us. Maybe the suffering gives us a better appreciation. You learn to fight for what others just take for granted. You love me, Matt. You never really believed I was having an affair. It\u0027s why you kept digging for that proof- because despite what I\u0027m telling you here, you and you alone really know me. You\u0027re the only one. And yes, I want to move out here and raise a family with you. That\u0027s all I want.\"\\n\\n Matt opened his mouth, but no words came out.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s okay,\" she said with a small smile. \"It\u0027s a lot to take in.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not that. It\u0027s just...\" He couldn\u0027t express it. The emotions were still swirling. He needed to let them settle. \"So what went wrong?\" he asked. \"After all these years, how did they find you?\"\\n\\n \"They didn\u0027t find me,\" she said. \"I found them.\"\\n\\n Matt was about to ask a follow-up question when another set of car headlights began to skitter across the wall. They slowed a beat too long. Matt raised his hand to quiet her for a moment. They both listened. The sound of an idling engine was faint, but it was there. No mistake.\\n\\n Their eyes met. Matt moved toward the window and peeked out.\\n\\n The car was parked across the street. The headlights went off. A few seconds later, so did the car engine. Matt recognized the car right away. He had, in fact, been in that car just a few hours earlier.\\n\\n It belonged to Lance Banner. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-innocent/page-40.html","bookId":1557,"book":{"id":1557,"title":"The Innocent","description":"Storyline: You never meant to kill him…. \\n One night, Matt Hunter innocently tried to break up a fight—and ended up a killer.
