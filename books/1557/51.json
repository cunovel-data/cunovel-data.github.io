{"id":108529,"no":51,"title":"Page 51","content":"AS MATT CROSSED into Pennsylvania in the white Isuzu, he was amazed at how much of what he\u0027d thought of as useless information he\u0027d retained from prison. Of course, prison is not the great education in all things crime many thought it was. You have to keep in mind that the inhabitants had all been, well, caught, and thus any claimed expertise had something of a shadow cast over it.\\n\\n He had also never listened too closely. Criminal activities did not interest him. His plan, which he\u0027d maintained for nine years, was to stay away from anything even remotely unlawful.\\n\\n That had changed.\\n\\n Saul\u0027s stolen car method had borne fruit. And now Matt remembered other law-evading lessons from his time behind bars. He stopped in the parking lot of a Great Western off Route 80. No security, no surprise. He did not want to steal another car, just a license plate. He wanted a license plate with the letter P in it. He got lucky. There was a car in the employee lot with a plate that began with the letter P. The employee car would work well, he thought. It was eleven A.M. Most places would be in early- to mid-shift by then. The employee owner would probably be inside for several more hours at a minimum.\\n\\n He stopped in a Home Depot and bought thin black electric tape, the kind you use to repair phone cords. Making sure no one was watching, he ripped a strip and put it on the letter P, turning it into the letter B. It wouldn\u0027t hold up under close scrutiny, but it should be good enough to get him where he was going.\\n\\n Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.\\n\\n There was no choice. Matt had to get to Reno. That meant flying on an airplane. He knew that would be risky. The prison tips for evading detection, even if good in their heyday, were all pre-9/11. Security had changed a lot since then, but there were still methods. He just had to think it through, move fast, and be more than a little lucky.\\n\\n First, he tried a little old-fashioned confusion and mayhem. He used a pay phone back on the New Jersey border to make flight reservations from Newark Airport to Toronto. Maybe they\u0027d track that down and figure he was an amateur. Maybe not. He hung up, moved to another pay phone, and made his other reservation. He wrote down his booking number, hung up, and shook his head.\\n\\n This was not going to be easy.\\n\\n Matt pulled into the Harrisburg airport parking lot. The Mauser M2 was still in his pocket. No way he could take it with him. Matt jammed the weapon under the front passenger seat because, if things did not go as planned, he might be back. The Isuzu had served him well. He wanted to write a note to its owner, explaining what he had done and why. With luck there\u0027d be a chance to explain in the future.\\n\\n Now to see if his plan worked...\\n\\n But first, he needed sleep. He bought a baseball cap in the souvenir store. Then he found a free chair in the arrivals area, folded his arms across his chest, closed his eyes, pulled the brim low across his face. People slept in airports all the time, he figured. Why would anyone bother him?\\n\\n He woke up an hour later, feeling like absolute hell. He headed upstairs to the departure level. He bought some extra-strength Tylenol and Motrin, took three of each. He cleaned up in the bathroom.\\n\\n The line at the ticket sales counter was long. That was good, if the timing worked. He wanted the staff to be busy. When it was his turn, the woman behind the desk gave him that distracted smile.\\n\\n \"To Chicago, Flight 188,\" he said.\\n\\n \"That flight leaves in twenty minutes,\" she said.\\n\\n \"I know. There was traffic and-\"\\n\\n \"May I see your picture ID, please?\"\\n\\n He gave her his driver\u0027s license. She typed in \"Hunter, M.\" This was the moment of truth. He stood perfectly still. She frowned and typed some more. Nothing happened. \"I don\u0027t see you in here, Mr. Hunter.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s odd.\"\\n\\n \"Do you have your booking number?\"\\n\\n \"I sure do.\"\\n\\n He handed the one he\u0027d gotten when he made the reservation on the phone. She typed in the letters: YTIQZ2. Matt held his breath.\\n\\n The woman sighed. \"I see the problem.\"\\n\\n \"Oh?\"\\n\\n She shook her head. \"Your name is misspelled on the reservation. You\u0027re listed here as Mike, not Matt. And the last name is Huntman, not Hunter.\"\\n\\n \"Honest mistake,\" Matt said.\\n\\n \"You\u0027d be surprised how often it happens.\"\\n\\n \"Nothing would surprise me,\" he said.\\n\\n They shared a world-is-full-of-dopes laugh. She printed out his ticket and collected the money. Matt smiled, thanked her, and headed to the plane.\\n\\n There was no nonstop from Harrisburg to Reno, but that might work in his favor. He didn\u0027t know how the airline computer system meshed with the federal government\u0027s, but two short flights would probably work better than one long one. Would the computer system pick up his name right away? Matt doubted it- or maybe hope sprang eternal. Thinking logically, the whole thing would have to take some time- gathering the information, sorting it, getting it to the right person. A few hours at a minimum.\\n\\n He\u0027d be in Chicago in one.\\n\\n It sounded good in theory.\\n\\n When he landed safely at O\u0027Hare in Chicago, he felt his heart start up again. He disembarked, trying not to look conspicuous, planning an escape route in case he saw a row of police officers at the gate. But no one grabbed him when he came off the plane. He let out a long breath. So they hadn\u0027t located him- yet. But now came the tricky part. The flight to Reno was longer. If they put together what he\u0027d done the first time, they\u0027d have plenty of time to nail him.\\n\\n So he tried something slightly different.\\n\\n Another long line at the airline purchasing desk. Matt might need that. He waited, snaking through the velvet ropes. He watched, seeing which employee looked most tired or complacent. He found her, on the far right. She looked bored past the point of tears. She examined IDs, but there was little spark in her eyes. She kept sighing. She kept glancing around, clearly distracted. Probably had a personal life, Matt thought. Maybe a fight with the husband or her teenage daughter or who knew what?\\n\\n Or maybe, Matt, she\u0027s very astute and just has a tired-looking face.\\n\\n Still, what other options were there? When Matt got to the front of the line and his agent wasn\u0027t free, he faked looking for something and told the family behind him to go ahead. He did that one more time and then it was his agent\u0027s turn to say, \"Next.\"\\n\\n He approached as inconspicuously as possible. \"My name is Matthew Huntler.\" He handed her a piece of paper with the booking number on it. She took it and started typing.\\n\\n \"Chicago to Reno/Tahoe, Mr. Huntler.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"ID, please.\"\\n\\n This was the hardest part. He had tried to set it up as smoothly as possible. M. Huntler was a member of their frequent-flier club- Matt had signed him up a few hours ago. Computers don\u0027t know from subtlety. Humans sometimes do.\\n\\n He gave her his wallet. She did not look at it at first. She was still typing into the computer. Maybe he\u0027d get lucky here. Maybe she wouldn\u0027t even check his ID.\\n\\n \"Any luggage to check?\"\\n\\n \"Not today, no.\"\\n\\n She nodded, still typing. Then she turned toward his ID. Matt felt his stomach tumble. He remembered something Bernie had sent him by e-mail several years ago. It said:\\n\\n Here\u0027s a fun test. Read this sentence:\\n\\n FINISHED FILES ARE THE RESULT OF YEARS OF SCIENTIFIC STUDY COMBINED WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF YEARS.\\n\\n Now count the F\u0027s in that sentence.\\n\\n He had done it and ended up with four. The real answer was six. You don\u0027t see every letter. That\u0027s not how we\u0027re built. He was counting on something like that here. Hunter, Huntler. Would someone really catch the difference?\\n\\n The woman said to him. \"Aisle or window.\"\\n\\n \"Aisle.\"\\n\\n He\u0027d made it. The security check went even easier- after all, Matt had already been ID\u0027d at the counter, right? The security guard looked at his picture, at his face, but he didn\u0027t come up with the fact that the ID said Hunter while the boarding pass read Huntler. Typos are made all the time anyway. You see hundreds or thousands of boarding passes each day. You really wouldn\u0027t notice such a small thing.\\n\\n Once again Matt got to his plane right as the gate was about to close. He settled into his aisle seat, closed his eyes, and didn\u0027t wake up until the pilot announced their descent into Reno.\\n\\n The door to Mother Katherine\u0027s office was closed.\\n\\n This time there was no flashback for Loren. She pounded hard on the door and put her hand on the knob. When she heard Mother Katherine say, \"Come in,\" she was ready.\\n\\n The Mother Superior had her back to the door. She did not turn around when Loren entered. She merely asked, \"Are you sure Sister Mary Rose was murdered?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Do you know who did it?\"\\n\\n \"Not yet.\"\\n\\n Mother Katherine nodded slowly. \"Have you learned her real identity?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Loren said. \"But it would have been easier if you\u0027d just told me.\"\\n\\n She expected Mother Katherine to argue, but she didn\u0027t. \"I couldn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\"\\n\\n \"Unfortunately it was not my place.\"\\n\\n \"She told you?\"\\n\\n \"Not exactly, no. But I knew enough.\"\\n\\n \"How did you figure it out?\"\\n\\n The old nun shrugged. \"Some of her statements about her past,\" she said. \"They didn\u0027t add up.\"\\n\\n \"You confronted her?\"\\n\\n \"No, never. And she never told me her true identity. She said it would endanger others. But I know that it was sordid. Sister Mary Rose wanted to move past it. She wanted to make amends. And she did. She contributed much to this school, to these children.\"\\n\\n \"With her work or with finances?\"\\n\\n \"Both.\"\\n\\n \"She gave you money?\"\\n\\n \"The parish,\" Mother Katherine corrected. \"Yes, she gave quite a bit.\"\\n\\n \"Sounds like guilt money.\"\\n\\n Mother Katherine smiled. \"Is there any other kind?\"\\n\\n \"So that story about chest compressions...?\"\\n\\n \"I already knew about the implants. She told me. She also told me that if someone learned who she really was, they\u0027d kill her.\"\\n\\n \"But you didn\u0027t think that happened.\"\\n\\n \"It appeared to be death by natural causes. I thought it best to leave it alone.\"\\n\\n \"What changed your mind?\"\\n\\n \"Gossip,\" she said.\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"One of our sisters confided to me that she had seen a man in Sister Mary Rose\u0027s room. I was suspicious, of course, but I couldn\u0027t prove anything. I also needed to protect the school\u0027s reputation. So I needed this investigated quietly and without my betraying Sister Mary Rose\u0027s trust.\"\\n\\n \"Enter me.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"And now that you know she was murdered?\"\\n\\n \"She left a letter.\"\\n\\n \"For whom?\"\\n\\n Mother Katherine showed her the envelope. \"A woman named Olivia Hunter.\"\\n\\n Adam Yates was closing in on panic.\\n\\n He parked a good distance from the old brewery and waited while Cal quickly cleaned up. The clues would be gone. Cal\u0027s weapon could not be traced. The license plates they were using would lead to nowhere. Some crazy person might identify a huge man chasing a woman but there would be no practical way of linking them with the dead bartender.\\n\\n Perhaps.\\n\\n No, no perhaps about it. He had been in worse scrapes. The bartender had pulled a rifle on Cal. It would have his fingerprints on it. The untraceable gun would be left behind. They would both be out of state in a matter of hours.\\n\\n They would get through it.\\n\\n When Cal sat in the passenger seat, Adam said, \"You messed up.\"\\n\\n Cal nodded. \"I did at that.\"\\n\\n \"You shouldn\u0027t have tried to shoot her.\"\\n\\n He nodded again. \"A mistake,\" he agreed. \"But we can\u0027t let her go. If her background comes out-\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s going to come out anyway. Loren Muse knows about it.\"\\n\\n \"True, but without Olivia Hunter, it doesn\u0027t lead anyplace. If she\u0027s caught, she will try to save herself. That may mean looking into what happened all those years ago.\"\\n\\n Yates felt something inside him start to tear. \"I don\u0027t want to hurt anyone.\"\\n\\n \"Adam?\"\\n\\n He looked at the big man.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s too late for that,\" Dollinger said. \"Us or them, remember?\"\\n\\n He nodded slowly.\\n\\n \"We need to find Olivia,\" Dollinger said. \"And I do mean we. If other agents arrest her...\"\\n\\n Yates finished it for him. \"She may talk.\"\\n\\n \"Precisely.\"\\n\\n \"So we call her in as a material witness,\" Yates said. \"Tell them to keep an eye on the nearby airports and train stations but not to do anything until they notify us.\"\\n\\n Cal nodded. \"Already done.\"\\n\\n Adam Yates considered his options. \"Let\u0027s head back to the county office. Maybe Loren found something useful on that Kimmy Dale.\"\\n\\n They had driven about five minutes when the phone rang. Cal picked it up and barked, \"Agent Dollinger.\"\\n\\n Cal listened closely.\\n\\n \"Let her land. Have Ted follow her. Do not, repeat, do not, approach. I\u0027ll be on the next plane out.\"\\n\\n He hung up.\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Olivia Hunter,\" he said. \"She\u0027s already on a plane to Reno.\"\\n\\n \"Reno again,\" Yates said.\\n\\n \"Home of the deceased Charles Talley and Max Darrow.\"\\n\\n \"And maybe the tape.\" Yates made a right up ahead. \"All the signs are pointing west, Cal. I think we better get to Reno too.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-innocent/page-51.html","bookId":1557,"book":{"id":1557,"title":"The Innocent","description":"Storyline: You never meant to kill him…. \\n One night, Matt Hunter innocently tried to break up a fight—and ended up a killer.
