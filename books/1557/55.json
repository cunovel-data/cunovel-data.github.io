In truth theirs had always been closer to a more political partnership. Adam Yates was the candidate who stayed clean. Cal Dollinger was behind-the-scenes and willing to get nasty. \"Go ahead,\" Dollinger said. \"Make the call.\" Yates called Ted Stevens, the agent they had assigned to follow Olivia Hunter. \"Hey, Ted, you still on her?\" Yates asked. \"I am at that.\" \"Where is she?\" \"You\u0027re not going to believe this. Ms. Hunter got off the plane and headed straight to a strip joint called the Eager Beaver.\" \"She still there?\" \"No, she left with a black stripper. I followed them back to some dump on the west side of town.\" Stevens gave him the address. Yates repeated it for Dollinger. \"So Olivia Hunter is still at the stripper\u0027s trailer,\" Yates asked. \"Yes.\" \"Anyone else with them?\" \"Nope, just the two of them alone.\" Yates looked at Dollinger. They had discussed how to handle this, how to get Stevens off the case and set it up for what was about to occur. \"Okay, thanks, Ted, you can leave them now. Meet me at the Reno office in ten minutes.\" \"Someone else picking them up?\" Stevens asked. \"Not necessary,\" Yates said. \"What\u0027s going on?\" \"Olivia Hunter used to work the clubs for Comb-Over. We flipped her yesterday.\" \"She knows a lot?\" \"She knows enough,\" Yates said. \"So what\u0027s she doing with the black chick?\" \"Well, she promised us that she would try to convince a woman named Kimmy Dale, a black dancer who works at the Eager Beaver, to flip too. Hunter told us that Dale knows a ton. So we gave her rope, see if she was keeping her word.\" \"Which it looks like she is.\" \"Yeah.\" \"So we\u0027re in good shape.\" Yates looked over at Dollinger. \"As long as Comb-Over doesn\u0027t find out, yeah, I think we\u0027re in real good shape. I\u0027ll meet you at the office in ten minutes, Ted. We\u0027ll talk more.\" Yates pressed the end button. They were in the concourse now, heading for the exit. He and Dollinger walked shoulder to shoulder, as they\u0027d done since elementary school. They lived on the same block in Henderson, outside of Las Vegas. Their wives had been college roommates and were still inseparable. Dollinger\u0027s oldest son was best friends with Yates\u0027s daughter Anne. He drove her to school every morning. \"There has to be another way,\" Yates said. \"There isn\u0027t.\" \"We\u0027re crossing a line here, Cal.\" \"We\u0027ve crossed lines before.\" \"Not like this.\" \"No, not like this,\" Cal agreed. \"We have families.\" \"I know.\" \"You have to do the math. On one side, you have one person. Candace Potter, an ex-stripper, probably an old coked-out whore, who was involved with lowlifes like Clyde Rangor and Emma Lemay. That\u0027s on one side of the equation, right?\" Yates nodded, knowing how this would go. \"On the other side are two families. Two husbands, two wives, three kids of yours, two of mine. You and me, we may not be that innocent. But the rest of them are. So we end one ex-hooker\u0027s life, maybe two if I can\u0027t get her away from this Kimmy Dale- or we let seven other lives, worthy lives, get destroyed.\" Yates kept his head down. \"Us or them,\" Dollinger said. \"In this case, it\u0027s not even a close call.\" \"I should go with you.\" \"No. We need you to be at the office with Ted. You\u0027re creating our murder scenario. When Hunter\u0027s body is found, it will naturally look like a mob hit to keep an informant quiet.\" They headed outside. Night had begun to settle in now. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Yates said. \"You\u0027ve pulled my butt out of plenty of fires, Adam.\" \"There has to be another way,\" Yates said again. \"Tell me there\u0027s another way.\" \"Go to the office,\" Dollinger said. \"I\u0027ll call you when it\u0027s done.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-innocent/page-55.html","bookId":1557,"book":{"id":1557,"title":"The Innocent","description":"Storyline: You never meant to kill him….
