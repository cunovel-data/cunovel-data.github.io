{"id":108516,"no":38,"title":"Page 38","content":"\"IT WAS ABOUT a year after I met you,\" Olivia said.\\n\\n She stood across the room. The color was back in her face. Her spine was straighter. It was as though she was gaining strength, telling him all this. For his part, Matt tried not to process yet. He just wanted to absorb.\\n\\n \"I was eighteen years old, but I\u0027d already been in Vegas for two years. A lot of us girls lived in old trailers. The manager of the club, an evil man named Clyde Rangor, had a couple of acres a mile down the road. It was just desert. He put up a chain-link fence, dragged in three or four of the most beaten-down trailers you\u0027d ever seen. And that\u0027s where we lived. The girls, they came and went, but at this time I was sharing the trailer with two people. One was new, a girl named Cassandra Meadows. She was maybe sixteen, seventeen years old. The other was named Kimmy Dale. Kimmy was away that day. See, Clyde used to send us out on road trips. We\u0027d strip in some small town, do three shows a day. Easy money for him. Good tips for us, though Clyde kept most of that too.\"\\n\\n Matt needed to get his bearings, but there was just no way. \"When you started there, you were how old?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Sixteen.\"\\n\\n He tried not to close his eyes. \"I don\u0027t understand how that worked.\"\\n\\n \"Clyde was connected. I don\u0027t really know how, but they\u0027d find hard-up girls from foster homes in Idaho.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s where you\u0027re from?\"\\n\\n She nodded. \"They had contacts in other states too. Oklahoma. Cassandra was from Kansas, I think. The girls would basically be funneled to Clyde\u0027s place. He\u0027d give them fake IDs and put them to work. It wasn\u0027t difficult. We both know that nobody really cares about the poor, but little children are, at least, sympathetic. We were just sullen teenagers. We had nobody.\"\\n\\n Matt said, \"Okay, go on.\"\\n\\n \"Clyde had this girlfriend named Emma Lemay. Emma was sort of a mother figure to all the girls. I know how that sounds, but when you consider what we\u0027d had in the past, she almost made you believe it. Clyde used to beat the hell out of her. He\u0027d just walk by, you\u0027d see Emma flinch. I didn\u0027t realize it then, but that victimization... it made us relate, I guess. Kimmy and I liked her. We all talked about one day getting out- that\u0027s all we ever talked about. I told her and Kimmy about meeting you. About what that night meant to me. They listened. We all knew it would never happen, but they listened anyway.\"\\n\\n There was a sound from outside of the room. A tiny cry. Olivia turned toward it.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s just Ethan,\" Matt said.\\n\\n \"Does he do that a lot?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n They waited. The house fell silent again.\\n\\n \"One day I was feeling sick,\" Olivia said. Her voice had again moved into a distant monotone. \"It\u0027s not like they give you nights off, but I was so nauseous I could barely stand, and, well, girls throwing up on stage didn\u0027t do much for business. Since Clyde and Emma weren\u0027t around, I checked with the guy at the door. He said I could leave. So I walked back to the Pen- that\u0027s what we called the trailer area. It was around three in the afternoon. The sun was still strong. I could almost feel my skin being baked.\"\\n\\n Olivia smiled wistfully then. \"You know what\u0027s odd? Well, I mean, the whole thing is odd, but you know what just struck me?\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"The degrees. Not the temperature degrees. But the degrees that change everything. The little ifs that become the big ones. You know about those better than anyone. If you had just driven straight back to Bowdoin. If Duff hadn\u0027t spilled the beer. You know.\"\\n\\n \"I do.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s the same thing here. If I hadn\u0027t been sick. If I had just danced like I did every night. Except in my case, well, I guess different people would say different things. But I\u0027d say my ifs saved my life.\"\\n\\n She was standing by the door. She eyed the knob as if she wanted to flee.\\n\\n Matt said, \"What happened when you got back to the Pen?\"\\n\\n \"The place was empty,\" Olivia said. \"Most of the girls were already at the club or in town. We usually finished around three in the morning and slept to noon. The Pen was so depressing, we got the hell out of there as soon as we could. So when I came back, it was silent. I opened the door to my trailer and the first thing I saw was blood on the floor.\"\\n\\n He watched closely now. Olivia\u0027s breathing had deepened, but her face was smooth, untroubled.\\n\\n \"I called out. That was stupid, I guess. I probably should have just started screaming and ran, I don\u0027t know. Another if, right? Then I looked around. The trailers had two rooms, but they\u0027re set up backwards, so you first walk into the bedroom where the three of us slept. I had the lower bunk. Kimmy\u0027s was on the top. Cassandra, the new girl, her bed was against the far wall. Kimmy was neat as a pin. She was always getting on us about not cleaning up. Our lives were dumps, she\u0027d say, but that didn\u0027t mean we had to live in one.\\n\\n \"Anyway, the place was totally trashed. The drawers had all been dumped out, clothes everywhere. And there, near Cassandra\u0027s bed, where the blood trailed off, I could see two legs on the floor. I ran over and I just pulled up short.\"\\n\\n Olivia looked him straight in the eye. \"Cassandra was dead. I didn\u0027t need to feel for a pulse. Her body was on its side, almost in a fetal position. Both eyes were open, staring at that wall. Her face was purple and swollen. There were cigarette burns on her arms. Her hands were still hog-tied with duct tape behind her back. You have to remember, Matt. I was eighteen years old. I may have felt older or looked older. I may have had too much life experience. But think about that. I\u0027m standing there looking at a dead body. I was frozen. I couldn\u0027t move. Even when I heard the sounds coming from the other room, even when I heard Emma scream out, \u0027Clyde, don\u0027t!\u0027 \"\\n\\n She stopped, closed her eyes, let loose a deep breath.\\n\\n \"I turned just in time to see a fist flying at my face. There was no time to react. Clyde didn\u0027t pull the punch at all. His knuckles landed flush on my nose. I actually heard the crack more than I felt it. My head snapped back. I fell back and landed on top of Cassandra- that was probably the worst part of all. Landing on her dead body. Her skin was all clammy. I tried to crawl off her. Blood was flowing down into my mouth.\"\\n\\n Olivia paused, swallowing air, trying to catch her breath. Matt had never felt more incompetent in his life. He did not move, did not say anything. He just let her gather herself.\\n\\n \"Clyde rushed over and looked down on me. His face... I mean, he usually had this smirk. I\u0027d seen him give Emma Lemay the backside of his hand lots of times. I know this sounds foreign to you. Why didn\u0027t we act? Why didn\u0027t we do something? But his beatings weren\u0027t unusual to us. They were normal. You have to understand that. This was all any of us knew.\"\\n\\n Matt nodded, which felt totally inadequate, but he understood this thinking. Prisons were filled with this sort of rationale- it wasn\u0027t so much that you did something awful as that the awful was simply the norm.\\n\\n \"Anyway,\" Olivia went on, \"the smirk was gone. If you think rattlesnakes are mean, you never met Clyde Rangor. But now, standing over me, he looked terrified. He was breathing hard. There was blood on his shirt. Behind him- and this is a sight I\u0027ll never forget- Emma just stood with her head down. Here I was, bleeding and hurt, and I was looking past the psycho with the clenched fists at his other victim. His real victim, I guess.\\n\\n \" \u0027Where\u0027s the tape?\u0027 Clyde asked me. I had no idea what he meant. He stomped down hard on my foot. I howled in pain. Then Clyde shouted, \u0027You playing games with me, bitch? Where is it?\u0027\\n\\n \"I tried to scramble back, but I bumped up into the corner. Clyde kicked Cassandra\u0027s body out of the way and followed. I was trapped. I could hear Emma\u0027s voice in the distance, meek as a lamb, \u0027Don\u0027t, Clyde. Please.\u0027 With his eyes still on me, Clyde reeled on her. He had the full weight of his body in the blow. The back of his hand split Emma\u0027s cheek wide open. She tumbled back and out of sight. But it was enough for me. The distraction gave me the chance to act. I lashed out with my foot and managed to kick the spot right below his knee. Clyde\u0027s leg buckled. I got to my feet and rolled over the bed. See, I had a destination in mind. Kimmy kept a gun in the room. I didn\u0027t like it, but if you think I had it tough, Kimmy had it worse. So she was always armed. She had two guns. She kept this mini-revolver, a twenty-two in her boot. Even onstage. And Kimmy had another gun under her mattress.\"\\n\\n Olivia stopped and smiled at him.\\n\\n \"What?\" Matt said.\\n\\n \"Like you.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t think I know about your gun?\"\\n\\n He had forgotten all about it. He checked his pants. They\u0027d taken them off him in the hospital. Olivia calmly opened her purse. \"Here,\" she said.\\n\\n She handed him the gun.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t want the police to find it and trace it back to you.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" he said stupidly. He looked at the gun, tucked it away.\\n\\n \"Why do you keep it?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think Kimmy did either. But it was there. And when Clyde went down, I dove for it. I didn\u0027t have much time. My kick hadn\u0027t incapacitated Clyde- it\u0027d just bought me a few seconds. I dug my hand under the top bunk\u0027s mattress. I heard him shout, \u0027Crazy whore, I\u0027m gonna kill you.\u0027 I had no doubt he would. I\u0027d seen Cassandra. I\u0027d seen his face. If he caught me, if I didn\u0027t get the gun, I was dead.\"\\n\\n Olivia was looking off now, her hand raised as though she were back in that trailer, digging for that gun. \"My hand was under the mattress. I could almost feel his breath on my neck. But I still couldn\u0027t find the gun. Clyde grabbed my hair. He was just starting to pull when my fingers felt the metal. I gripped for all I was worth as he tugged me back. The gun came with me. Clyde saw it. I didn\u0027t have a real grip on it. My thumb and forefinger were wrapped around the butt of the gun. I tried to snake my finger around the trigger. But Clyde was on me. He grabbed my wrist. I tried to fight him off. He was too strong. But I didn\u0027t let go. I held on. And then he dug his thumbnail into my skin. Clyde had these really long, sharp fingernails. See this?\"\\n\\n Olivia made a fist, tilted it back so that he could see the crescent-white scar on the underside of her wrist. Matt had noticed it before. A lifetime ago, she\u0027d told him it was from a fall off a horse.\\n\\n \"Clyde Rangor did that. He dug his fingernail in so deep that he drew blood. I dropped the gun. He still had me by the hair. He flung me onto the bed and jumped on top of me. He grabbed me by the neck and began to squeeze. He was crying now. That\u0027s what I remember. Clyde was squeezing the life out of me and he was crying. Not because he cared or anything like that. He was scared. He was choking me and I could hear him pleading, \u0027Just tell me where it is. Just tell me... \u0027 \"\\n\\n Olivia gently put her own hand up to her throat now. \"I struggled. I kicked, I flailed, but I could feel the power draining out of me. There was nothing behind my blows anymore. I could feel his thumb pushing down on my throat. I was dying. And then I heard the gun go off.\"\\n\\n Her hand dropped to the side. The antique clock in the dining room, a wedding gift to Bernie and Marsha, started to chime. Olivia waited, let it finish playing.\\n\\n \"The gun wasn\u0027t loud. It was more like the crack of a bat. I guess that\u0027s because it was a twenty-two, I don\u0027t know. For a second, Clyde\u0027s grip somehow tightened. His face looked more surprised than pained. He let go of me. I started gagging, choking. I rolled to the side, gasping for air. Emma Lemay was standing behind him. She pointed the gun at him and it was like all those years of abuse, all those beatings, they just boiled over. She didn\u0027t cower. She didn\u0027t look down. Clyde spun toward her, enraged, and she fired again, right in his face.\\n\\n \"Then Emma pulled the trigger one more time and Clyde Rangor was dead.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-innocent/page-38.html","bookId":1557,"book":{"id":1557,"title":"The Innocent","description":"Storyline: You never meant to kill him…. \\n One night, Matt Hunter innocently tried to break up a fight—and ended up a killer.
