{"id":108522,"no":44,"title":"Page 44","content":"SITTING WITH HER FEET on her desk, Loren Muse decided to call Max Darrow\u0027s widow. It was three or four in the morning in Nevada- Loren could never remember if Nevada was two hours or three behind- but she suspected that a woman whose husband gets murdered probably sleeps uneasily. She dialed the number. It went into voice mail. A man\u0027s voice said, \"Max and Gertie can\u0027t answer your call right now. We\u0027re probably out fishing. Leave a message, okay?\" The voice from the grave made her pause. Max Darrow, retired cop, was a human being. Simple, but you forget that sometimes. You get caught up in the details, in the puzzle pieces. A life has been lost here. Gertie will have to change that message. She and Max won\u0027t be going fishing anymore. Sounded like a small thing but it was a life, a struggle, a world now shattered. Loren left a message with her phone number and hung up. \"Hey, what are you working on?\" It was Adam Yates, the FBI chief from Vegas. He\u0027d driven to the county prosecutor\u0027s office with her after their meeting with Joan Thurston. Loren looked up at him. \"Just a few strange developments.\" \"Such as?\" She told him about her conversation with Cingle Shaker. Yates grabbed a chair from a nearby desk. He sat, never taking his eyes off hers. He was one of those guys. Big on eye contact. When she finished, Yates frowned. \"I just can\u0027t see how this Hunter guy fits in.\" \"He should be in custody soon. Maybe we\u0027ll learn something then.\" Yates nodded, kept up with the eye contact. Loren said, \"What?\" \"This case,\" Yates said. His voice was soft now. \"It means a great deal to me.\" \"Any reason in particular?\" \"Do you have children?\" he asked. \"No.\" \"Married?\" \"No.\" \"You gay?\" \"Jesus, Yates.\" He held up his hand. \"That was stupid, sorry.\" \"Why all the questions?\" \"You don\u0027t have kids. I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll understand.\" \"Are you for real?\" Yates held up the hand again. \"I don\u0027t mean that the way it sounded. I\u0027m sure you\u0027re a good person and all.\" \"Gee, thanks.\" \"It\u0027s just that... when you have kids, it just changes things.\" \"Do me a favor, Yates. Please don\u0027t give me that having-children-alters-you spiel. I listen to that crap enough from my painfully few friends.\" \"It\u0027s not that.\" He paused. \"Actually I think single people make better cops. You can focus.\" \"Speaking of which...\" She picked up some papers and pretended to be busy. \"Let me ask you something, Muse.\" She waited. \"When you wake up,\" Yates went on, \"who\u0027s the first person you think about?\" \"Excuse me?\" \"Okay, it\u0027s morning. You open your eyes. You start getting out of bed. Who is the first person you think about?\" \"Why don\u0027t you tell me?\" \"Well, not to be insulting, but the answer is you, right? There\u0027s nothing wrong with that. You think about you. That\u0027s normal. All single people do that. You wake up and wonder what you\u0027re going to do that day. Oh, sure, you might take care of an elderly parent or something. But here\u0027s the thing. When you have a child, you are never number one again. Someone is more important than you. It changes your worldview. It has to. You think you know about protect and serve. But when you have a family...\" \"Is there a point to this?\" Adam Yates finally stopped with the eye contact. \"I have a son. His name is Sam. He\u0027s fourteen now. When he was three years old, he got meningitis. We thought he might die. He was in the hospital in this great big bed. It was too big for him, you know? It looked like it would swallow him up. And me, I just sat next to him and watched him get worse.\" He gulped a breath and swallowed hard. Loren let him take his time. \"After a couple of hours, I picked Sam up and held him in my arms. I didn\u0027t sleep. I didn\u0027t put him down. I just kept holding him. My wife says it was three full days. I don\u0027t know. I just knew that if I kept Sam in my arms, if I kept watching him, then death couldn\u0027t take him away from me.\" Yates seemed to drift off. Loren spoke softly. \"I still don\u0027t see the point.\" \"Well, here it is,\" he said, his voice back to normal. He locked eyes again. His pupils were pinpricks. \"They threatened my family.\" Yates put his hand to his face, then back down as if he wasn\u0027t sure where he wanted to put it. \"When I first started this case,\" he went on, \"they set their sights on my wife and kids. So you understand.\" She opened her mouth, said nothing. The phone on the desk rang. Loren picked it up. Lance Banner said, \"We lost Matt.\" \"What?\" \"That kid who lives with them. Kyra, whatever. She started screaming and... Anyway, his wife is here. She says that she was driving the car, not him, and that she doesn\u0027t know where he is.\" \"That\u0027s crap.\" \"I know it.\" \"Bring her in.\" \"She refuses to come.\" \"Excuse me?\" \"We have nothing on her.\" \"She\u0027s a material witness in a murder investigation.\" \"She\u0027s lawyering up. She says we either have to arrest her or let her go.\" Her cell phone chirped. Loren checked the caller ID. The call was originating from Max Darrow\u0027s house. \"I\u0027ll get back to you.\" She hung up the office phone and clicked on the mobile. \"Investigator Muse.\" \"This is Gertie Darrow. You left me a message?\" Loren could hear the tears in her voice. \"I\u0027m sorry about your loss.\" \"Thank you.\" \"I don\u0027t mean to disturb you at such a terrible time, but I really need to ask you a few questions.\" \"I understand.\" \"Thank you,\" Loren said. She grabbed a pen. \"Do you know why your husband was in Newark, Mrs. Darrow?\" \"No.\" She said it as though it was the most painful word she ever uttered. \"He told me he was visiting a friend in Florida. A fishing trip, he said.\" \"I see. He was retired, yes?\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"Could you tell me if he was working on anything?\" \"I don\u0027t understand. What does this have to do with his murder?\" \"This is just routine-\" \"Please, Investigator Muse,\" she interrupted, her voice up a notch. \"My husband was a police officer, remember? You\u0027re not calling me at this hour for routine questions.\" Loren said, \"I\u0027m trying to find a motive.\" \"A motive?\" \"Yes.\" \"But...\" And then she quieted down. \"The other officer. The one who called before. Investigator Wine.\" \"Yes. He works in my office.\" \"He told me that Max was in a car, that\"- there was a choke in the voice but she kept it together-\"that he had his pants down.\" Loren closed her eyes. So Wine had already told her. She understood, she guessed. In today\u0027s society of openness, you couldn\u0027t even spare a widow anymore. \"Mrs. Darrow?\" \"What?\" \"I think that was a setup. I don\u0027t think there was any prostitute. I think your husband was murdered for some other reason. And I think it might involve an old case of his. So I\u0027m asking you: Was he working on anything?\" There was a brief silence. Then: \"That girl.\" \"What?\" \"I knew it. I just knew it.\" \"I\u0027m sorry, Mrs. Darrow. I\u0027m not sure what you mean.\" \"Max never talked about business. He never brought it home. And he was retired. She had no reason to come around.\" \"Who?\" \"I don\u0027t know her name. She was a young thing. Maybe twenty.\" \"What did she want?\" \"I told you. I don\u0027t know. But Max... after she left, he was like a madman. He started going through old files.\" \"Do you know what the files referred to?\" \"No.\" Then: \"Do you really think this could have something to do with Max\u0027s murder?\" \"Yes, ma\u0027am. I think it might have everything to do with it. Does the name Clyde Rangor mean anything to you?\" \"No, I\u0027m sorry.\" \"How about Emma Lemay or Charles Talley?\" \"No.\" \"Candace Potter?\" Silence. \"Mrs. Darrow?\" \"I saw that name.\" \"Where?\" \"On his desk. There was a file. Must have been a month ago. I just saw the word \u0027Potter.\u0027 I remember because that was the name of the bad guy in It\u0027s a Wonderful Life. Remember? Mr. Potter?\" \"Do you know where the file is now?\" \"I\u0027ll go through the cabinets, Investigator Muse. If it\u0027s still here, I\u0027ll find it for you and call back.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-innocent/page-44.html","bookId":1557,"book":{"id":1557,"title":"The Innocent","description":"Storyline: You never meant to kill him….
