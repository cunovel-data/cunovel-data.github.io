{"id":107650,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"15. THE CULLENS\\n\\n The muted light of yet another cloudy day eventually woke me. I lay with my arm across my eyes, groggy and dazed. Something, a dream trying to be remembered, struggled to break into my consciousness. I moaned and rolled on my side, hoping more sleep would come. And then the previous day flooded back into my awareness.\\n\\n \"Oh!\" I sat up so fast it made my head spin.\\n\\n \"Your hair looks like a haystack... but I like it.\" His unruffled voice came from the rocking chair in the corner.\\n\\n \"Edward! You stayed!\" I rejoiced, and thoughtlessly threw myself across the room and into his lap. In the instant that my thoughts caught up with my actions, I froze, shocked by my own uncontrolled enthusiasm. I stared up at him, afraid that I had crossed the wrong line.\\n\\n But he laughed.\\n\\n \"Of course,\" he answered, startled, but seeming pleased by my reaction. His hands rubbed my back.\\n\\n I laid my head cautiously against his shoulder, breathing in the smell of his skin.\\n\\n \"I was sure it was a dream.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not that creative,\" he scoffed.\\n\\n \"Charlie!\" I remembered, thoughtlessly jumping up again and heading to the door.\\n\\n \"He left an hour ago - after reattaching your battery cables, I might add. I have to admit I was disappointed. Is that really all it would take to stop you, if you were determined to go?\"\\n\\n I deliberated where I stood, wanting to return to him badly, but afraid I might have morning breath.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not usually this confused in the morning,\" he noted. He held his arms open for me to return. A nearly irresistible invitation.\\n\\n \"I need another human minute,\" I admitted.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll wait.\"\\n\\n I skipped to the bathroom, my emotions unrecognizable. I didn\u0027t know myself, inside or out. The face in the mirror was practically a stranger - eyes too bright, hectic spots of red across my cheekbones. After I brushed my teeth, I worked to straighten out the tangled chaos that was my hair. I splashed my face with cold water, and tried to breathe normally, with no noticeable success. I half-ran back to my room.\\n\\n It seemed like a miracle that he was there, his arms still waiting for me. He reached out to me, and my heart thumped unsteadily.\\n\\n \"Welcome back,\" he murmured, taking me into his arms.\\n\\n He rocked me for a while in silence, until I noticed that his clothes were changed, his hair smooth.\\n\\n \"You left?\" I accused, touching the collar of his fresh shirt.\\n\\n \"I could hardly leave in the clothes I came in - what would the neighbors think?\"\\n\\n I pouted.\\n\\n \"You were very deeply asleep; I didn\u0027t miss anything.\" His eyes gleamed. \"The talking came earlier.\"\\n\\n I groaned. \"What did you hear?\"\\n\\n His gold eyes grew very soft. \"You said you loved me.\"\\n\\n \"You knew that already,\" I reminded him, ducking my head.\\n\\n \"It was nice to hear, just the same.\"\\n\\n I hid my face against his shoulder.\\n\\n \"I love you,\" I whispered.\\n\\n \"You are my life now,\" he answered simply.\\n\\n There was nothing more to say for the moment. He rocked us back and forth as the room grew lighter.\\n\\n \"Breakfast time,\" he said eventually, casually - to prove, I\u0027m sure, that he remembered all my human frailties.\\n\\n So I clutched my throat with both hands and stared at him with wide eyes. Shock crossed his face.\\n\\n \"Kidding!\" I snickered. \"And you said I couldn\u0027t act!\"\\n\\n He frowned in disgust. \"That wasn\u0027t funny.\"\\n\\n \"It was very funny, and you know it.\" But I examined his gold eyes carefully, to make sure that I was forgiven. Apparently, I was.\\n\\n \"Shall I rephrase?\" he asked. \"Breakfast time for the human.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, okay.\"\\n\\n He threw me over his stone shoulder, gently, but with a swiftness that left me breathless. I protested as he carried me easily down the stairs, but he ignored me. He sat me right side up on a chair.\\n\\n The kitchen was bright, happy, seeming to absorb my mood.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s for breakfast?\" I asked pleasantly.\\n\\n That threw him for a minute.\\n\\n \"Er, I\u0027m not sure. What would you like?\" His marble brow puckered.\\n\\n I grinned, hopping up.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s all right, I fend for myself pretty well. Watch me hunt.\"\\n\\n I found a bowl and a box of cereal. I could feel his eyes on me as I poured the milk and grabbed a spoon. I sat my food on the table, and then paused.\\n\\n \"Can I get you anything?\" I asked, not wanting to be rude.\\n\\n He rolled his eyes. \"Just eat, Bella.\"\\n\\n I sat at the table, watching him as I took a bite. He was gazing at me, studying my every movement. It made me self-conscious. I cleared my mouth to speak, to distract him.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s on the agenda for today?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Hmmm...\" I watched him frame his answer carefully. \"What would you say to meeting my family?\"\\n\\n I gulped.\\n\\n \"Are you afraid now?\" He sounded hopeful.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I admitted; how could I deny it - he could see my eyes.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry.\" He smirked. \"I\u0027ll protect you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not afraid of them,\" I explained. \"I\u0027m afraid they won\u0027t... like me. Won\u0027t they be, well, surprised that you would bring someone... like me... home to meet them? Do they know that I know about them?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, they already know everything. They\u0027d taken bets yesterday, you know\" - he smiled, but his voice was harsh - \"on whether I\u0027d bring you back, though why anyone would bet against Alice, I can\u0027t imagine. At any rate, we don\u0027t have secrets in the family. It\u0027s not really feasible, what with my mind reading and Alice seeing the future and all that.\"\\n\\n \"And Jasper making you feel all warm and fuzzy about spilling your guts, don\u0027t forget that.\"\\n\\n \"You paid attention,\" he smiled approvingly.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been known to do that every now and then.\" I grimaced. \"So did Alice see me coming?\"\\n\\n His reaction was strange. \"Something like that,\" he said uncomfortably, turning away so I couldn\u0027t see his eyes. I stared at him curiously.\\n\\n \"Is that any good?\" he asked, turning back to me abruptly and eyeing my breakfast with a teasing look on his face. \"Honestly, it doesn\u0027t look very appetizing.\"\\n\\n \"Well, it\u0027s no irritable grizzly...\" I murmured, ignoring him when he glowered. I was still wondering why he responded that way when I mentioned Alice. I hurried through my cereal, speculating.\\n\\n He stood in the middle of the kitchen, the statue of Adonis again, staring abstractedly out the back windows.\\n\\n Then his eyes were back on me, and he smiled his heartbreaking smile.\\n\\n \"And you should introduce me to your father, too, I think.\"\\n\\n \"He already knows you,\" I reminded him.\\n\\n \"As your boyfriend, I mean.\"\\n\\n I stared at him with suspicion. \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t that customary?\" he asked innocently.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I admitted. My dating history gave me few reference points to work with. Not that any normal rules of dating applied here. \"That\u0027s not necessary, you know. I don\u0027t expect you to... I mean, you don\u0027t have to pretend for me.\"\\n\\n His smile was patient. \"I\u0027m not pretending.\"\\n\\n I pushed the remains of my cereal around the edges of the bowl, biting my lip.\\n\\n \"Are you going to tell Charlie I\u0027m your boyfriend or not?\" he demanded.\\n\\n \"Is that what you are?\" I suppressed my internal cringing at the thought of Edward and Charlie and the word boy friend all in the same room at the same time.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a loose interpretation of the word \u0027boy,\u0027 I\u0027ll admit.\"\\n\\n \"I was under the impression that you were something more, actually,\" I confessed, looking at the table.\\n\\n \"Well, I don\u0027t know if we need to give him all the gory details.\" He reached across the table to lift my chin with a cold, gentle finger. \"But he will need some explanation for why I\u0027m around here so much. I don\u0027t want Chief Swan getting a restraining order put on me.\"\\n\\n \"Will you be?\" I asked, suddenly anxious. \"Will you really be here?\"\\n\\n \"As long as you want me,\" he assured me.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll always want you,\" I warned him. \"Forever.\"\\n\\n He walked slowly around the table, and, pausing a few feet away, he reached out to touch his fingertips to my cheek. His expression was unfathomable.\\n\\n \"Does that make you sad?\" I asked.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t answer. He stared into my eyes for an immeasurable period of time.\\n\\n \"Are you finished?\" he finally asked.\\n\\n I jumped up. \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Get dressed - I\u0027ll wait here.\"\\n\\n It was hard to decide what to wear. I doubted there were any etiquette books detailing how to dress when your vampire sweetheart takes you home to meet his vampire family. It was a relief to think the word to myself. I knew I shied away from it intentionally.\\n\\n I ended up in my only skirt - long, khaki-colored, still casual. I put on the dark blue blouse he\u0027d once complimented. A quick glance in the mirror told me my hair was entirely impossible, so I pulled it back into a pony tail.\\n\\n \"Okay.\" I bounced down the stairs. \"I\u0027m decent.\"\\n\\n He was waiting at the foot of the stairs, closer than I\u0027d thought, and I bounded right into him. He steadied me, holding me a careful distance away for a few seconds before suddenly pulling me closer.\\n\\n \"Wrong again,\" he murmured in my ear. \"You are utterly indecent - no one should look so tempting, it\u0027s not fair.\"\\n\\n \"Tempting how?\" I asked. \"I can change...\"\\n\\n He sighed, shaking his head. \"You are so absurd.\" He pressed his cool lips delicately to my forehead, and the room spun. The smell of his breath made it impossible to think.\\n\\n \"Shall I explain how you are tempting me?\" he said. It was clearly a rhetorical question. His fingers traced slowly down my spine, his breath coming more quickly against my skin. My hands were limp on his chest, and I felt lightheaded again. He tilted his head slowly and touched his cool lips to mine for the second time, very carefully, parting them slightly.\\n\\n And then I collapsed.\\n\\n \"Bella?\" His voice was alarmed as he caught me and held me up.\\n\\n \"You... made... me... faint,\" I accused him dizzily.\\n\\n \"What am I going to do with you?\" he groaned in exasperation. \"Yesterday I kiss you, and you attack me! Today you pass out on me!\"\\n\\n I laughed weakly, letting his arms support me while my head spun.\\n\\n \"So much for being good at everything,\" he sighed.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the problem.\" I was still dizzy. \"You\u0027re too good. Far, far too\\n\\n good.\"\\n\\n \"Do you feel sick?\" he asked; he\u0027d seen me like this before.\\n\\n \"No - that wasn\u0027t the same kind of fainting at all. I don\u0027t know what happened.\" I shook my head apologeticallv, \"I think I forgot to breathe.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t take you anywhere like this.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fine,\" I insisted. \"Your family is going to think I\u0027m insane anyway, what\u0027s the difference?\"\\n\\n He measured my expression for a moment. \"I\u0027m very partial to that color with your skin,\" he offered unexpectedly. I flushed with pleasure, and looked away.\\n\\n \"Look, I\u0027m trying really hard not to think about what I\u0027m about to do, so can we go already?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"And you\u0027re worried, not because you\u0027re headed to meet a houseful of vampires, but because you think those vampires won\u0027t approve of you, correct?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right,\" I answered immediately, hiding my surprise at his casual use of the word.\\n\\n He shook his head. \"You\u0027re incredible.\"\\n\\n I realized, as he drove my truck out of the main part of town, that I had no idea where he lived. We passed over the bridge at the Calawah River, the road winding northward, the houses flashing past us growing farther apart, getting bigger. And then we were past the other houses altogether, driving through misty forest. I was trying to decide whether to ask or be patient, when he turned abruptly onto an unpaved road. It was unmarked, barely visible among the ferns. The forest encroached on both sides, leaving the road ahead only discernible for a few meters as it twisted, serpentlike, around the ancient trees.\\n\\n And then, after a few miles, there was some thinning of the woods, and we were suddenly in a small meadow, or was it actually a lawn? The gloom of the forest didn\u0027t relent, though, for there were six primordial cedars that shaded an entire acre with their vast sweep of branches. The trees held their protecting shadow right up to the walls of the house that rose among them, making obsolete the deep porch that wrapped around the first story.\\n\\n I don\u0027t know what I had expected, but it definitely wasn\u0027t this. The house was timeless, graceful, and probably a hundred years old. It was painted a soft, faded white, three stories tall, rectangular and well proportioned. The windows and doors were either part of the original structure or a perfect restoration. My truck was the only car in sight. I could hear the river close by, hidden in the obscurity of the forest.\\n\\n \"Wow.\"\\n\\n \"You like it?\" He smiled.\\n\\n \"It... has a certain charm.\"\\n\\n He pulled the end of my ponytail and chuckled.\\n\\n \"Ready?\" he asked, opening my door.\\n\\n \"Not even a little bit - let\u0027s go.\" I tried to laugh, but it seemed to get stuck in my throat. I smoothed my hair nervously.\\n\\n \"You look lovely.\" He took my hand easily, without thinking about it.\\n\\n We walked through the deep shade up to the porch. I knew he could feel my tension; his thumb rubbed soothing circles into the back of my hand.\\n\\n He opened the door for me.\\n\\n The inside was even more surprising, less predictable, than the exterior. It was very bright, very open, and very large. This must have originally been several rooms, but the walls had been removed from most of the first floor to create one wide space. The back, south-facing wall had been entirely replaced with glass, and, beyond the shade of the cedars, the lawn stretched bare to the wide river. A massive curving staircase dominated the west side of the room. The walls, the high-beamed ceiling, the wooden floors, and the thick carpets were all varying shades of white.\\n\\n Waiting to greet us, standing just to the left of the door, on a raised portion of the floor by a spectacular grand piano, were Edward\u0027s parents.\\n\\n I\u0027d seen Dr. Cullen before, of course, yet I couldn\u0027t help but be struck again by his youth, his outrageous perfection. At his side was Esme, I assumed, the only one of the family I\u0027d never seen before. She had the same pale, beautiful features as the rest of them. Something about her heart-shaped face, her billows of soft, caramel-colored hair, reminded me of the ing¨¦nues of the silent-movie era. She was small, slender, yet less angular, more rounded than the others. They were both dressed casually, in light colors that matched the inside of the house. They smiled in welcome, but made no move to approach us. Trying not to frighten me, I guessed.\\n\\n \"Carlisle, Esme,\" Edward\u0027s voice broke the short silence, \"this is Bella.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re very welcome, Bella.\" Carlisle\u0027s step was measured, careful as he approached me. He raised his hand tentatively, and I stepped forward to shake hands with him.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s nice to see you again, Dr. Cullen.\"\\n\\n \"Please, call me Carlisle.\"\\n\\n \"Carlisle.\" I grinned at him, my sudden confidence surprising me. I could feel Edward\u0027s relief at my side.\\n\\n Esme smiled and stepped forward as well, reaching for my hand. Her cold, stone grasp was just as I expected.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s very nice to know you,\" she said sincerely.\\n\\n \"Thank you. I\u0027m glad to meet you, too.\" And I was. It was like meeting a fairy tale - Snow White, in the flesh.\\n\\n \"Where are Alice and Jasper?\" Edward asked, but no one answered, as they had just appeared at the top of the wide staircase.\\n\\n \"Hey, Edward!\" Alice called enthusiastically. She ran down the stairs, a streak of black hair and white skin, coming to a sudden and graceful stop in front of me. Carlisle and Esme shot warning glances at her, but I liked it. It was natural - for her, anyway.\\n\\n \"Hi, Bella!\" Alice said, and she bounced forward to kiss my cheek. If Carlisle and Esme had looked cautious before, they now looked staggered. There was shock in my eyes, too, but I was also very pleased that she seemed to approve of me so entirely. I was startled to feel Edward stiffen at my side. I glanced at his face, but his expression was unreadable.\\n\\n \"You do smell nice, I never noticed before,\" she commented, to my extreme embarrassment.\\n\\n No one else seemed to know quite what to say, and then Jasper was there - tall and leonine. A feeling of ease spread through me, and I was suddenly comfortable despite where I was. Edward stared at Jasper, raising one eyebrow, and I remembered what Jasper could do.\\n\\n \"Hello, Bella,\" Jasper said. He kept his distance, not offering to shake my hand. But it was impossible to feel awkward near him.\\n\\n \"Hello, Jasper.\" I smiled at him shyly, and then at the others. \"It\u0027s\\n\\n nice to meet you all - you have a very beautiful home,\" I added conventionally.\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" Esme said. \"We\u0027re so glad that you came.\" She spoke with feeling, and I realized that she thought I was brave.\\n\\n I also realized that Rosalie and Emmett were nowhere to be seen, and I remembered Edward\u0027s too-innocent denial when I\u0027d asked him if the others didn\u0027t like me.\\n\\n Carlisle\u0027s expression distracted me from this train of thought; he was gazing meaningfully at Edward with an intense expression. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Edward nod once.\\n\\n I looked away, trying to be polite. My eyes wandered again to the beautiful instrument on the platform by the door. I suddenly remembered my childhood fantasy that, should I ever win a lottery, I would buy a grand piano for my mother. She wasn\u0027t really good - she only played for herself on our secondhand upright - but I loved to watch her play. She was happy, absorbed - she seemed like a new, mysterious being to me then, someone outside the \"mom\" persona I took for granted. She\u0027d put me through lessons, of course, but like most kids, I whined until she let me quit.\\n\\n Esme noticed my preoccupation.\\n\\n \"Do you play?\" she asked, inclining her head toward the piano.\\n\\n I shook my head. \"Not at all. But it\u0027s so beautiful. Is it yours?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" she laughed. \"Edward didn\u0027t tell you he was musical?\"\\n\\n \"No.\" I glared at his suddenly innocent expression with narrowed eyes. \"I should have known, I guess.\"\\n\\n Esme raised her delicate eyebrows in confusion.\\n\\n \"Edward can do everything, right?\" I explained.\\n\\n Jasper snickered and Esme gave Edward a reproving look.\\n\\n \"I hope you haven\u0027t been showing off- it\u0027s rude,\" she scolded.\\n\\n \"Just a bit,\" he laughed freely. Her face softened at the sound, and they shared a brief look that I didn\u0027t understand, though Esme\u0027s face seemed almost smug.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s been too modest, actually,\" I corrected.\\n\\n \"Well, play for her,\" Esme encouraged.\\n\\n \"You just said showing off was rude,\" he objected.\\n\\n \"There are exceptions to every rule,\" she replied.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d like to hear you play,\" I volunteered.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s settled then.\" Esme pushed him toward the piano. He pulled me along, sitting me on the bench beside him.\\n\\n He gave me a long, exasperated look before he turned to the keys.\\n\\n And then his fingers flowed swiftly across the ivory, and the room was filled with a composition so complex, so luxuriant, it was impossible to believe only one set of hands played. I felt my chin drop, my mouth open in astonishment, and heard low chuckles behind me at my reaction.\\n\\n Edward looked at me casually, the music still surging around us without a break, and winked. \"Do you like it?\"\\n\\n \"You wrote this?\" I gasped, understanding.\\n\\n He nodded. \"It\u0027s Esme\u0027s favorite.\"\\n\\n I closed my eyes, shaking my head.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m feeling extremely insignificant.\"\\n\\n The music slowed, transforming into something softer, and to my surprise I detected the melody of his lullaby weaving through the profusion of notes.\\n\\n \"You inspired this one,\" he said softly. The music grew unbearably sweet.\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t speak.\\n\\n \"They like you, you know,\" he said conversationally. \"Esme especially.\"\\n\\n I glanced behind me, but the huge room was empty now.\\n\\n \"Where did they go?\"\\n\\n \"Very subtly giving us some privacy, I suppose.\"\\n\\n I sighed. \"They like me. But Rosalie and Emmett...\" I trailed off, not sure how to express my doubts.\\n\\n He frowned. \"Don\u0027t worry about Rosalie,\" he said, his eyes wide and persuasive. \"She\u0027ll come around.\"\\n\\n I pursed my lips skeptically. \"Emmett?\"\\n\\n \"Well, he thinks I\u0027m a lunatic, it\u0027s true, but he doesn\u0027t have a problem with you. He\u0027s trying to reason with Rosalie.\"\\n\\n \"What is it that upsets her?\" I wasn\u0027t sure if I wanted to know the answer.\\n\\n He sighed deeply. \"Rosalie struggles the most with... with what we are. It\u0027s hard for her to have someone on the outside know the truth. And she\u0027s a little jealous.\"\\n\\n \"Rosalie is jealous of me?\" I asked incredulously. I tried to imagine a universe in which someone as breathtaking as Rosalie would have any possible reason to feel jealous of someone like me.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re human.\" He shrugged. \"She wishes that she were, too.\"\\n\\n \"Oh,\" I muttered, still stunned. \"Even Jasper, though...\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s really my fault,\" he said. \"I told you he was the most recent to try our way of life. I warned him to keep his distance.\"\\n\\n I thought about the reason for that, and shuddered.\\n\\n \"Esme and Carlisle... ?\" I continued quickly, to keep him from noticing.\\n\\n \"Are happy to see me happy. Actually, Esme wouldn\u0027t care if you had a third eye and webbed feet. All this time she\u0027s been worried about me, afraid that there was something missing from my essential makeup, that I was too young when Carlisle changed me... She\u0027s ecstatic. Every time I touch you, she just about chokes with satisfaction.\"\\n\\n \"Alice seems very... enthusiastic.\"\\n\\n \"Alice has her own way of looking at things,\" he said through tight lips.\\n\\n \"And you\u0027re not going to explain that, are you?\"\\n\\n A moment of wordless communication passed between us. He realized that I knew he was keeping something from me. I realized that he wasn\u0027t going to give anything away. Not now.\\n\\n \"So what was Carlisle telling you before?\"\\n\\n His eyebrows pulled together. \"You noticed that, did you?\"\\n\\n I shrugged. \"Of course.\"\\n\\n He looked at me thoughtfully for a few seconds before answering. \"He wanted to tell me some news - he didn\u0027t know if it was something I would share with you.\"\\n\\n \"Will you?\"\\n\\n \"I have to, because I\u0027m going to be a little... overbearingly protective over the next few days - or weeks - and I wouldn\u0027t want you to think I\u0027m naturally a tyrant.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing\u0027s wrong, exactly. Alice just sees some visitors coming soon. They know we\u0027re here, and they\u0027re curious.\"\\n\\n \"Visitors?\"\\n\\n \"Yes... well, they aren\u0027t like us, of course - in their hunting habits, I mean. They probably won\u0027t come into town at all, but I\u0027m certainly not going to let you out of my sight till they\u0027re gone.\"\\n\\n I shivered.\\n\\n \"Finally, a rational response!\" he murmured. \"I was beginning to think you had no sense of self-preservation at all.\"\\n\\n I let that one pass, looking away, my eyes wandering again around the spacious room.\\n\\n He followed my gaze. \"Not what you expected, is it?\" he asked, his voice smug.\\n\\n \"No,\" I admitted.\\n\\n \"No coffins, no piled skulls in the corners; I don\u0027t even think we have cobwebs... what a disappointment this must be for you,\" he continued slyly.\\n\\n I ignored his teasing. \"It\u0027s so light... so open.\"\\n\\n He was more serious when he answered. \"It\u0027s the one place we never have to hide.\"\\n\\n The song he was still playing, my song, drifted to an end, the final chords shifting to a more melancholy key. The last note hovered poignantly in the silence.\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" I murmured. I realized there were tears in my eyes. I dabbed at them, embarrassed.\\n\\n He touched the corner of my eye, trapping one I missed. He lifted his finger, examining the drop of moisture broodingly. Then, so quickly I couldn\u0027t be positive that he really did, he put his finger to his mouth to taste it.\\n\\n I looked at him questioningly, and he gazed back for a long moment before he finally smiled.\\n\\n \"Do you want to see the rest of the house?\"\\n\\n \"No coffins?\" I verified, the sarcasm in my voice not entirely masking the slight but genuine anxiety I felt.\\n\\n He laughed, taking my hand, leading me away from the piano.\\n\\n \"No coffins,\" he promised.\\n\\n We walked up the massive staircase, my hand trailing along the satin-smooth rail. The long hall at the top of the stairs was paneled with a honey-colored wood, the same as the floorboards.\\n\\n \"Rosalie and Emmett\u0027s room... Carlisle\u0027s office... Alice\u0027s room...\" He gestured as he led me past the doors.\\n\\n He would have continued, but I stopped dead at the end of the hall, staring incredulously at the ornament hanging on the wall above my head. Edward chuckled at my bewildered expression.\\n\\n \"You can laugh,\" he said. \"It is sort of ironic.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t laugh. My hand raised automatically, one finger extended as if to touch the large wooden cross, its dark patina contrasting with the lighter tone of the wall. I didn\u0027t touch it, though I was curious if the aged wood would feel as silky as it looked.\\n\\n \"It must be very old,\" I guessed.\\n\\n He shrugged. \"Early sixteen-thirties, more or less.\"\\n\\n I looked away from the cross to stare at him.\\n\\n \"Why do you keep this here?\" I wondered.\\n\\n \"Nostalgia. It belonged to Carlisle\u0027s father.\"\\n\\n \"He collected antiques?\" I suggested doubtfully.\\n\\n \"No. He carved this himself. It hung on the wall above the pulpit in the vicarage where he preached.\"\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t sure if my face betrayed my shock, but I returned to gazing at the simple, ancient cross, just in case. I quickly did the mental math; the cross was over three hundred and seventy years old. The silence stretched on as I struggled to wrap my mind around the concept of so many years.\\n\\n \"Are you all right?\" He sounded worried.\\n\\n \"How old is Carlisle?\" I asked quietly, ignoring his question, still staring up.\\n\\n \"He just celebrated his three hundred and sixty-second birthday,\" Edward said. I looked back at him, a million questions in my eyes.\\n\\n He watched me carefully as he spoke.\\n\\n \"Carlisle was born in London, in the sixteen-forties, he believes. Time wasn\u0027t marked as accurately then, for the common people anyway. It was just before Cromwell\u0027s rule, though.\"\\n\\n I kept my face composed, aware of his scrutiny as I listened. It was easier if I didn\u0027t try to believe.\\n\\n \"He was the only son of an Anglican pastor. His mother died giving birth to him. His father was an intolerant man. As the Protestants came into power, he was enthusiastic in his persecution of Roman Catholics and other religions. He also believed very strongly in the reality of evil. He led hunts for witches, werewolves... and vampires.\" I grew very still at the word. I\u0027m sure he noticed, but he went on without pausing.\\n\\n \"They burned a lot of innocent people - of course the real creatures that he sought were not so easy to catch.\\n\\n \"When the pastor grew old, he placed his obedient son in charge of the raids. At first Carlisle was a disappointment; he was not quick to accuse, to see demons where they did not exist. But he was persistent, and more clever than his father. He actually discovered a coven of true vampires that lived hidden in the sewers of the city, only coming out by\\n\\n night to hunt. In those days, when monsters were not just myths and legends, that was the way many lived.\\n\\n \"The people gathered their pitchforks and torches, of course\" - his brief laugh was darker now - \"and waited where Carlisle had seen the monsters exit into the street. Eventually one emerged.\"\\n\\n His voice was very quiet; I strained to catch the words.\\n\\n \"He must have been ancient, and weak with hunger. Carlisle heard him call out in Latin to the others when he caught the scent of the mob. He ran through the streets, and Carlisle - he was twenty-three and very fast - was in the lead of the pursuit. The creature could have easily outrun them, but Carlisle thinks he was too hungry, so he turned and attacked. He fell on Carlisle first, but the others were close behind, and he turned to defend himself. He killed two men, and made off with a third, leaving Carlisle bleeding in the street.\"\\n\\n He paused. I could sense he was editing something, keeping something from me.\\n\\n \"Carlisle knew what his father would do. The bodies would be burned - anything infected by the monster must be destroyed. Carlisle acted instinctively to save his own life. He crawled away from the alley while the mob followed the fiend and his victim. He hid in a cellar, buried himself in rotting potatoes for three days. It\u0027s a miracle he was able to keep silent, to stay undiscovered.\\n\\n \"It was over then, and he realized what he had become.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m not sure what my face was revealing, but he suddenly broke off.\\n\\n \"How are you feeling?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fine,\" I assured him. And, though I bit my lip in hesitation, he must have seen the curiosity burning in my eyes.\\n\\n He smiled. \"I expect you have a few more questions for me.\"\\n\\n \"A few.\"\\n\\n His smile widened over his brilliant teeth. He started back down the hall, pulling me along by the hand. \"Come on, then,\" he encouraged. \"I\u0027ll show you.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twilight-twilight-1/page-15.html","bookId":2023,"book":{"id":2023,"title":"Twilight (Twilight #1)","description":"Storyline: Twilight is a young-adult vampire-romance novel by author Stephenie Meyer.
