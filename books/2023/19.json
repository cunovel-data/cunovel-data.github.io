This wasn\u0027t going to be pleasant. Edward pulled up slowly, staying well back from my truck. All three of them were acutely alert, ramrod straight in their seats, listening to every sound of the wood, looking through every shadow, catching every scent, searching for something out of place. The engine cut off, and I sat, motionless, as they continued to listen. \"He\u0027s not here,\" Edward said tensely. \"Let\u0027s go.\" Emmett reached over to help me get out of the harness. \"Don\u0027t worry, Bella,\" he said in a low but cheerful voice, \"we\u0027ll take care of things here quickly.\" I felt moisture filling up my eyes as I looked at Emmett. I barely knew him, and yet, somehow, not knowing when I would see him again after tonight was anguishing. I knew this was just a faint taste of the goodbyes I would have to survive in the next hour, and the thought made the tears begin to spill. \"Alice, Emmett.\" Edward\u0027s voice was a command. They slithered soundlessly into the darkness, instantly disappearing. Edward opened my door and took my hand, then drew me into the protecting enclosure of his arm. He walked me swiftly toward the house, eyes always roving through the night. \"Fifteen minutes,\" he warned under his breath. \"I can do this.\" I sniffled. My tears had given me an inspiration. I stopped on the porch and took hold of his face in my hands. I looked fiercely into his eyes. \"I love you,\" I said in a low, intense voice. \"I will always love you, no matter what happens now.\" \"Nothing is going to happen to you, Bella,\" he said just as fiercely. \"Just follow the plan, okay? Keep Charlie safe for me. He\u0027s not going to like me very much after this, and I want to have the chance to apologize later.\" \"Get inside, Bella. We have to hurry.\" His voice was urgent. \"One more thing,\" I whispered passionately. \"Don\u0027t listen to another word I say tonight!\" He was leaning in, and so all I had to do was stretch up on my toes to kiss his surprised, frozen lips with as much force as I was capable of. Then I turned and kicked the door open. \"Go away, Edward!\" I yelled at him, running inside and slamming the door shut in his still-shocked face. \"Bella?\" Charlie had been hovering in the living room, and he was already on his feet. \"Leave me alone!\" I screamed at him through my tears, which were flowing relentlessly now. I ran up the stairs to my room, throwing the door shut and locking it. I ran to my bed, flinging myself on the floor to retrieve my duffel bag. I reached swiftly between the mattress and box spring to grab the knotted old sock that contained my secret cash hoard. Charlie was pounding on my door. \"Bella, are you okay? What\u0027s going on?\" His voice was frightened. \"I\u0027m going borne,\" I shouted, my voice breaking in the perfect spot. \"Did he hurt you?\" His tone edged toward anger. \"No!\" I shrieked a few octaves higher. I turned to my dresser, and Edward was already there, silently yanking out armfuls of random clothes, which he proceeded to throw to me. \"Did he break up with you?\" Charlie was perplexed. \"No!\" I yelled, slightly more breathless as I shoved everything into the bag. Edward threw another drawer\u0027s contents at me. The bag was pretty much full now. \"What happened, Bella?\" Charlie shouted through the door, pounding again. \"I broke up with him!\" I shouted back, jerking on the zipper of my bag. Edward\u0027s capable hands pushed mine away and zipped it smoothly. He put the strap carefully over my arm. \"I\u0027ll be in the truck - go!\" he whispered, and pushed me toward the door. He vanished out the window. I unlocked the door and pushed past Charlie roughly, struggling with my heavy bag as I ran down the stairs. \"What happened?\" he yelled. He was right behind me. \"I thought you liked him.\" He caught my elbow in the kitchen. Though he was still bewildered, his grip was firm. He spun me around to look at him, and I could see in his face that he had no intention of letting me leave. I could think of only one way to escape, and it involved hurting him so much that I hated myself for even considering it. But I had no time, and I had to keep him safe. I glared up at my father, fresh tears in my eyes for what I was about to do. \"I do like him - that\u0027s the problem. I can\u0027t do this anymore! I can\u0027t put down any more roots here! I don\u0027t want to end up trapped in this stupid, boring town like Mom! I\u0027m not going to make the same dumb mistake she did. I hate it - I can\u0027t stay here another minute!\" His hand dropped from my arm like I\u0027d electrocuted him. I turned away from his shocked, wounded face and headed for the door. \"Bells, you can\u0027t leave now. It\u0027s nighttime,\" he whispered behind me. I didn\u0027t turn around. \"I\u0027ll sleep in the truck if I get tired.\" \"Just wait another week,\" he pled, still shell-shocked. \"Ren¨¦e will be back by then.\" This completely derailed me. \"What?\" Charlie continued eagerly, almost babbling with relief as I hesitated. \"She called while you were out. Things aren\u0027t going so well in Florida, and if Phil doesn\u0027t get signed by the end of the week, they\u0027re going back to Arizona. The assistant coach of the Sidewinders said they might have a spot for another shortstop.\" I shook my head, trying to reassemble my now-confused thoughts. Every passing second put Charlie in more danger. \"I have a key,\" I muttered, turning the knob. He was too close, one hand extended toward me, his face dazed. I couldn\u0027t lose any more time arguing with him. I was going to have to hurt him further. \"Just let me go, Charlie.\" I repeated my mother\u0027s last words as she\u0027d walked out this same door so many years ago. I said them as angrily as I could manage, and I threw the door open. \"It didn\u0027t work out, okay? I really, really hate Forks!\" My cruel words did their job - Charlie stayed frozen on the doorstep, stunned, while I ran into the night. I was hideously frightened of the empty yard. I ran wildly for the truck, visualizing a dark shadow behind me. I threw my bag in the bed and wrenched the door open. The key was waiting in the ignition. \"I\u0027ll call you tomorrow!\" I yelled, wishing more than anything that I could explain everything to him right then, knowing I would never be able to. I gunned the engine and peeled out. Edward reached for my hand. \"Pull over,\" he said as the house, and Charlie, disappeared behind us. \"I can drive,\" I said through the tears pouring down my cheeks. His long hands unexpectedly gripped my waist, and his foot pushed mine off the gas pedal. He pulled me across his lap, wrenching my hands free of the wheel, and suddenly he was in the driver\u0027s seat. The truck didn\u0027t swerve an inch. \"You wouldn\u0027t be able to find the house,\" he explained. Lights flared suddenly behind us. I stared out the back window, eyes wide with horror. \"It\u0027s just Alice,\" he reassured me. He took my hand again. My mind was filled with the image of Charlie in the doorway. \"The tracker?\" \"He heard the end of your performance,\" Edward said grimly. \"Charlie?\" I asked in dread. \"The tracker followed us. He\u0027s running behind us now.\" My body went cold. \"Can we outrun him?\" \"No.\" But he sped up as he spoke. The truck\u0027s engine whined in protest. My plan suddenly didn\u0027t feel so brilliant anymore. I was staring back at Alice\u0027s headlights when the truck shuddered and a dark shadow sprung up outside the window. My bloodcurdling scream lasted a fraction of a second before Edward\u0027s hand clamped down on my mouth. \"It\u0027s Emmett!\" He released my mouth, and wound his arm around my waist. \"It\u0027s okay, Bella,\" he promised. \"You\u0027re going to be safe.\" We raced through the quiet town toward the north highway. \"I didn\u0027t realize you were still so bored with small-town life,\" he said conversationally, and I knew he was trying to distract me. \"It seemed like you were adjusting fairly well - especially recently. Maybe I was just flattering myself that I was making life more interesting for you.\" \"I wasn\u0027t being nice,\" I confessed, ignoring his attempt at diversion, looking down at my knees. \"That was the same thing my mom said when she left him. You could say I was hitting below the belt.\" \"Don\u0027t worry. He\u0027ll forgive you.\" He smiled a little, though it didn\u0027t touch his eyes. I stared at him desperately, and he saw the naked panic in my eyes. \"Bella, it\u0027s going to be all right.\" \"But it won\u0027t be all right when I\u0027m not with you,\" I whispered. \"We\u0027ll be together again in a few days,\" he said, tightening his arm around me. \"Don\u0027t forget that this was your idea.\" \"It was the best idea - of course it was mine.\" His answering smile was bleak and disappeared immediately. \"Why did this happen?\" I asked, my voice catching. \"Why me?\" He stared blackly at the road ahead. \"It\u0027s my fault - I was a fool to expose you like that.\" The rage in his voice was directed internally. \"That\u0027s not what I meant,\" I insisted. \"I was there, big deal. It didn\u0027t bother the other two. Why did this James decide to kill met There\u0027re people all over the place, why me?\" He hesitated, thinking before he answered. \"I got a good look at his mind tonight,\" he began in a low voice. \"I\u0027m not sure if there\u0027s anything I could have done to avoid this, once he saw you. It is partially your fault.\" His voice was wry. \"If you didn\u0027t smell so appallingly luscious, he might not have bothered. But when I defended you... well, that made it a lot worse. He\u0027s not used to being thwarted, no matter how insignificant the object. He thinks of himself as a hunter and nothing else. His existence is consumed with tracking, and a challenge is all he asks of life. Suddenly we\u0027ve presented him with a beautiful challenge - a large clan of strong fighters all bent on protecting the one vulnerable element. You wouldn\u0027t believe how euphoric he is now. It\u0027s his favorite game, and we\u0027ve just made it his most exciting game ever.\" His tone was full of disgust. He paused a moment. \"But if I had stood by, he would have killed you right then,\" he said with hopeless frustration. \"I thought... I didn\u0027t smell the same to the others... as I do to you,\" I said hesitantly. \"You don\u0027t. But that doesn\u0027t mean that you aren\u0027t still a temptation to every one of them. If you had appealed to the tracker - or any of them - the same way you appeal to me, it would have meant a fight right there.\" I shuddered. \"I don\u0027t think I have any choice but to kill him now,\" he muttered. \"Carlisle won\u0027t like it.\" I could hear the tires cross the bridge, though I couldn\u0027t see the river in the dark. I knew we were getting close. I had to ask him now. \"How can you kill a vampire?\" He glanced at me with unreadable eyes and his voice was suddenly harsh. \"The only way to be sure is to tear him to shreds, and then burn the pieces.\" \"And the other two will fight with him?\" \"The woman will. I\u0027m not sure about Laurent. They don\u0027t have a very strong bond - he\u0027s only with them for convenience. He was embarrassed by James in the meadow...\" \"But James and the woman - they\u0027ll try to kill you?\" I asked, my voice raw. \"Bella, don\u0027t you dare waste time worrying about me. Your only concern is keeping yourself safe and - please, please - trying not to be reckless.\" \"Is he still following?\" \"Yes. He won\u0027t attack the house, though. Not tonight.\" He turned off onto the invisible drive, with Alice following behind. We drove right up to the house. The lights inside were bright, but they did little to alleviate the blackness of the encroaching forest. Emmett had my door open before the truck was stopped; he pulled me out of the seat, tucked me like a football into his vast chest, and ran me through the door. We burst into the large white room, Edward and Alice at our sides. All of them were there; they were already on their feet at the sound of our approach. Laurent stood in their midst. I could hear low growls rumble deep in Emmett\u0027s throat as he set me down next to Edward. \"He\u0027s tracking us,\" Edward announced, glaring balefully at Laurent. Laurent\u0027s face was unhappy. \"I was afraid of that.\" Alice danced to Jasper\u0027s side and whispered in his ear; her lips quivered with the speed of her silent speech. They flew up the stairs together. Rosalie watched them, and then moved quickly to Emmett\u0027s side. Her beautiful eyes were intense and - when they flickered unwillingly to my face - furious. \"What will he do?\" Carlisle asked Laurent in chilling tones. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he answered. \"I was afraid, when your boy there defended her, that it would set him off.\" \"Can you stop him?\" Laurent shook his head. \"Nothing stops James when he gets started.\" \"We\u0027ll stop him,\" Emmett promised. There was no doubt what he meant. \"You can\u0027t bring him down. I\u0027ve never seen anything like him in my three hundred years. He\u0027s absolutely lethal. That\u0027s why I joined his coven.\" His coven, I thought, of course. The show of leadership in the clearing was merely that, a show. Laurent was shaking his head. He glanced at me, perplexed, and back to Carlisle. \"Are you sure it\u0027s worth it?\" Edward\u0027s enraged roar filled the room; Laurent cringed back. Carlisle looked gravely at Laurent. \"I\u0027m afraid you\u0027re going to have to make a choice.\" Laurent understood. He deliberated for a moment. His eyes took in every face, and finally swept the bright room. \"I\u0027m intrigued by the life you\u0027ve created here. But I won\u0027t get in the middle of this. I bear none of you any enmity, but I won\u0027t go up against James. I think I will head north - to that clan in Denali.\" He hesitated. \"Don\u0027t underestimate James. He\u0027s got a brilliant mind and unparalleled senses. He\u0027s every bit as comfortable in the human world as you seem to be, and he won\u0027t come at you head on... I\u0027m sorry for what\u0027s been unleashed here. Truly sorry.\" He bowed his head, but I saw him flicker another puzzled look at me. \"Go in peace,\" was Carlisle\u0027s formal answer. Laurent took another long look around himself, and then he hurried out the door. The silence lasted less than a second. \"How close?\" Carlisle looked to Edward. Esme was already moving; her hand touched an inconspicuous keypad on the wall, and with a groan, huge metal shutters began sealing up the glass wall. I gaped. \"About three miles out past the river; he\u0027s circling around to meet up with the female.\" \"What\u0027s the plan?\" \"We\u0027ll lead him off, and then Jasper and Alice will run her south.\" \"And then?\" Edward\u0027s tone was deadly. \"As soon as Bella is clear, we hunt him.\" \"I guess there\u0027s no other choice,\" Carlisle agreed, his face grim. Edward turned to Rosalie. \"Get her upstairs and trade clothes,\" Edward commanded. She stared back at him with livid disbelief. \"Why should I?\" she hissed. \"What is she to me? Except a menace - a danger you\u0027ve chosen to inflict on all of us.\" I flinched back from the venom in her voice. \"Rose...\" Emmett murmured, putting one hand on her shoulder. She shook it off. But I was watching Edward carefully, knowing his temper, worried about his reaction. He surprised me. He looked away from Rosalie as if she hadn\u0027t spoken, as if she didn\u0027t exist. \"Esme?\" he asked calmly. \"Of course,\" Esme murmured. Esme was at my side in half a heartbeat, swinging me up easily into her arms, and dashing up the stairs before I could gasp in shock. \"What are we doing?\" I asked breathlessly as she set me down in a dark room somewhere off the second-story hall. \"Trying to confuse the smell. It won\u0027t work for long, but it might help get you out.\" I could hear her clothes falling to the floor. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll fit...\" I hesitated, but her hands were abruptly pulling my shirt over my head. I quickly stripped my jeans off myself. She handed me something, it felt like a shirt. I struggled to get my arms through the right holes. As soon as I was done she handed me her slacks. I yanked them on, but I couldn\u0027t get my feet out; they were too long. She deftly rolled the hems a few times so I could stand. Somehow she was already in my clothes. She pulled me back to the stairs, where Alice stood, a small leather bag in one hand. They each grabbed one of my elbows and half-carried me as they flew down the stairs. It appeared that everything had been settled downstairs in our absence. Edward and Emmett were ready to leave, Emmett carrying a heavy-looking backpack over his shoulder. Carlisle was handing something small to Esme. He turned and handed Alice the same thing - it was a tiny silver cell phone. \"Esme and Rosalie will be taking your truck, Bella,\" he told me as he passed. I nodded, glancing warily at Rosalie. She was glowering at Carlisle with a resentful expression. \"Alice, Jasper - take the Mercedes. You\u0027ll need the dark tint in the south.\" They nodded as well. \"We\u0027re taking the Jeep.\" I was surprised to see that Carlisle intended to go with Edward. I realized suddenly, with a stab of fear, that they made up the hunting party. \"Alice,\" Carlisle asked, \"will they take the bait?\" Everyone watched Alice as she closed her eyes and became incredibly still. Finally her eyes opened. \"He\u0027ll track you. The woman will follow the truck. We should be able to leave after that.\" Her voice was certain. \"Let\u0027s go.\" Carlisle began to walk toward the kitchen. But Edward was at my side at once. He caught me up in his iron grip, crushing me to him. He seemed unaware of his watching family as he pulled my face to his, lifting my feet off the floor. For the shortest second, his lips were icy and hard against mine. Then it was over. He set me down, still holding my face, his glorious eyes burning into mine. His eyes went blank, curiously dead, as he turned away. And they were gone. We stood there, the others looking away from me as the tears streaked noiselessly down my face. The silent moment dragged on, and then Esme\u0027s phone vibrated in her hand. It flashed to her ear. \"Now,\" she said. Rosalie stalked out the front door without another glance in my direction, but Esme touched my cheek as she passed. \"Be safe.\" Her whisper lingered behind them as they slipped out the door. I heard my truck start thunderously, and then fade away. Jasper and Alice waited. Alice\u0027s phone seemed to be at her ear before it buzzed. \"Edward says the woman is on Esme\u0027s trail. I\u0027ll get the car.\" She vanished into the shadows the way Edward had gone. Jasper and I looked at each other. He stood across the length of the entryway from me... being careful. \"You\u0027re wrong, you know,\" he said quietly. \"What?\" I gasped. \"I can feel what you\u0027re feeling now - and you are worth it.\" \"I\u0027m not,\" I mumbled. \"If anything happens to them, it will be for nothing.\" \"You\u0027re wrong,\" he repeated, smiling kindly at me. I heard nothing, but then Alice stepped through the front door and came toward me with her arms held out. \"May I?\" she asked. \"You\u0027re the first one to ask permission.\" I smiled wryly. She lifted me in her slender arms as easily as Emmett had, shielding me protectively, and then we flew out the door, leaving the lights bright behind us.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twilight-twilight-1/page-19.html","bookId":2023,"book":{"id":2023,"title":"Twilight (Twilight #1)","description":"Storyline: Twilight is a young-adult vampire-romance novel by author Stephenie Meyer.
