{"id":107659,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"24. AN IMPASSE My eyes opened to a bright, white light. I was in an unfamiliar room, a white room. The wall beside me was covered in long vertical blinds; over my head, the glaring lights blinded me. I was propped up on a hard, uneven bed - a bed with rails. The pillows were flat and lumpy. There was an annoying beeping sound somewhere close by. I hoped that meant I was still alive. Death shouldn\u0027t be this uncomfortable. My hands were all twisted up with clear tubes, and something was taped across my face, under my nose. I lifted my hand to rip it off. \"No, you don\u0027t.\" And cool fingers caught my hand. \"Edward?\" I turned my head slightly, and his exquisite face was just inches from mine, his chin resting on the edge of my pillow. I realized again that I was alive, this time with gratitude and elation. \"Oh, Edward, I\u0027m so sorry!\" \"Shhhh,\" he shushed me. \"Everything\u0027s all right now.\" \"What happened?\" I couldn\u0027t remember clearly, and my mind rebelled against me as I tried to recall. \"I was almost too late. I could have been too late,\" he whispered, his voice tormented. \"I was so stupid, Edward. I thought he had my mom.\" \"He tricked us all.\" \"I need to call Charlie and my mom,\" I realized through the haze. \"Alice called them. Ren¨¦e is here - well, here in the hospital. She\u0027s getting something to eat right now.\" \"She\u0027s here?\" I tried to sit up, but the spinning in my head accelerated, and his hand pushed me gently down onto the pillows. \"She\u0027ll be back soon,\" he promised. \"And you need to stay still.\" \"But what did you tell her?\" I panicked. I had no interest in being soothed. My mom was here and I was recovering from a vampire attack. \"Why did you tell her I\u0027m here?\" \"You fell down two flights of stairs and through a window.\" He paused. \"You have to admit, it could happen.\" I sighed, and it hurt. I stared down at my body under the sheet, the huge lump that was my leg. \"How bad am I?\" I asked. \"You have a broken leg, four broken ribs, some cracks in your skull, bruises covering every inch of your skin, and you\u0027ve lost a lot of blood. They gave you a few transfusions. I didn\u0027t like it - it made you smell all wrong for a while.\" \"That must have been a nice change for you.\" \"No, I like how you smell.\" \"How did you do it?\" I asked quietly. He knew what I meant at once. \"I\u0027m not sure.\" He looked away from my wondering eyes, lifting my gauze-wrapped hand from the bed and holding it gently in his, careful not to disrupt the wire connecting me to one of the monitors. I waited patiently for the rest. He sighed without returning my gaze. \"It was impossible... to stop,\" he whispered. \"Impossible. But I did.\" He looked up finally, with half a smile. \"I must love you.\" \"Don\u0027t I taste as good as I smell?\" I smiled in response. That hurt my face. \"Even better - better than I\u0027d imagined.\" \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I apologized. He raised his eyes to the ceiling. \"Of all the things to apologize for.\" \"What should I apologize for?\" \"For very nearly taking yourself away from me forever.\" \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I apologized again. \"I know why you did it.\" His voice was comforting. \"It was still irrational, of course. You should have waited for me, you should have told me.\" \"You wouldn\u0027t have let me go.\" \"No,\" he agreed in a grim tone, \"I wouldn\u0027t.\" Some very unpleasant memories were beginning to come back to me. I shuddered, and then winced. He was instantly anxious. \"Bella, what\u0027s wrong?\" \"What happened to James?\" \"After I pulled him off you, Emmett and Jasper took care of him.\" There was a fierce note of regret in his voice. This confused me. \"I didn\u0027t see Emmett and Jasper there.\" \"They had to leave the room... there was a lot of blood.\" \"But you stayed.\" \"Yes, I stayed.\" \"And Alice, and Carlisle...\" I said in wonder. \"They love you, too, you know.\" A flash of painful images from the last time I\u0027d seen Alice reminded me of something. \"Did Alice see the tape?\" I asked anxiously. \"Yes.\" A new sound darkened his voice, a tone of sheer hatred. \"She was always in the dark, that\u0027s why she didn\u0027t remember.\" \"I know. She understands now.\" His voice was even, but his face was black with fury. I tried to reach his face with my free hand, but something stopped me. I glanced down to see the IV pulling at my hand. \"Ugh.\" I winced. \"What is it?\" he asked anxiously - distracted, but not enough. The bleakness did not entirely leave his eyes. \"Needles,\" I explained, looking away from the one in my hand. I concentrated on a warped ceiling tile and tried to breathe deeply despite the ache in my ribs. \"Afraid of a needle,\" he muttered to himself under his breath, shaking his head. \"Oh, a sadistic vampire, intent on torturing her to death, sure, no problem, she runs off to meet him. An IV, on the other hand...\" I rolled my eyes. I was pleased to discover that this reaction, at least, was pain-free. I decided to change the subject. \"Why are you here?\" I asked. He stared at me, first confusion and then hurt touching his eyes. His brows pulled together as he frowned. \"Do you want me to leave?\" \"No!\" I protested, horrified by the thought. \"No, I meant, why does my mother think you\u0027re here? I need to have my story straight before she gets back.\" \"Oh,\" he said, and his forehead smoothed back into marble. \"I came to Phoenix to talk some sense into you, to convince you to come back to Forks.\" His wide eyes were so earnest and sincere, I almost believed him myself. \"You agreed to see me, and you drove out to the hotel where I was staying with Carlisle and Alice - of course I was here with parental supervision,\" he inserted virtuously, \"but you tripped on the stairs on the way to my room and... well, you know the rest. You don\u0027t need to remember any details, though; you have a good excuse to be a little muddled about the finer points.\" I thought about it for a moment. \"There are a few flaws with that story. Like no broken windows.\" \"Not really,\" he said. \"Alice had a little bit too much fun fabricating evidence. It\u0027s all been taken care of very convincingly - you could probably sue the hotel if you wanted to. You have nothing to worry about,\" he promised, stroking my cheek with the lightest of touches. \"Your only job now is to heal.\" I wasn\u0027t so lost to the soreness or the fog of medication that I didn\u0027t respond to his touch. The beeping of the monitor jumped around erratically - now he wasn\u0027t the only one who could hear my heart misbehave. \"That\u0027s going to be embarrassing,\" I muttered to myself. He chuckled, and a speculative look came into his eye. \"Hmm, I wonder...\" He leaned in slowly; the beeping noise accelerated wildly before his lips even touched me. But when they did, though with the most gentle of pressure, the beeping stopped altogether. He pulled back abruptly, his anxious expression turning to relief as the monitor reported the restarting of my heart. \"It seems that I\u0027m going to have to be even more careful with you than usual.\" He frowned. \"I was not finished kissing you,\" I complained. \"Don\u0027t make me come over there.\" He grinned, and bent to press his lips lightly to mine. The monitor went wild. But then his lips were taut. He pulled away. \"I think I hear your mother,\" he said, grinning again. \"Don\u0027t leave me,\" I cried, an irrational surge of panic flooding through me. I couldn\u0027t let him go - he might disappear from me again. He read the terror in my eyes for a short second. \"I won\u0027t,\" he promised solemnly, and then he smiled. \"I\u0027ll take a nap.\" He moved from the hard plastic chair by my side to the turquoise faux-leather recliner at the foot of my bed, leaning it all the way back, and closing his eyes. He was perfectly still. \"Don\u0027t forget to breathe,\" I whispered sarcastically. He took a deep breath, his eyes still closed. I could hear my mother now. She was talking to someone, maybe a nurse, and she sounded tired and upset. I wanted to jump out of the bed and run to her, to calm her, promise that everything was fine. But I wasn\u0027t in any sort of shape for jumping, so I waited impatiently. The door opened a crack, and she peeked through. \"Mom!\" I whispered, my voice full of love and relief. She took in Edward\u0027s still form on the recliner, and tiptoed to my bedside. \"He never leaves, does he?\" she mumbled to herself. \"Mom, I\u0027m so glad to see you!\" She bent down to hug me gently, and I felt warm tears falling on my cheeks. \"Bella, I was so upset!\" \"I\u0027m sorry, Mom. But everything\u0027s fine now, it\u0027s okay,\" I comforted her. \"I\u0027m just glad to finally see your eyes open.\" She sat on the edge of my bed. I suddenly realized I didn\u0027t have any idea when it was. \"How long have they been closed?\" \"It\u0027s Friday, hon, you\u0027ve been out for a while.\" \"Friday?\" I was shocked. I tried to remember what day it had been when... but I didn\u0027t want to think about that. \"They had to keep you sedated for a while, honey - you\u0027ve got a lot of injuries.\" \"I know.\" I could feel them. \"You\u0027re lucky Dr. Cullen was there. He\u0027s such a nice man... very young, though. And he looks more like a model than a doctor...\" \"You met Carlisle?\" \"And Edward\u0027s sister Alice. She\u0027s a lovely girl.\" \"She is,\" I agreed wholeheartedly. She glanced over her shoulder at Edward, lying with his eyes closed in the chair. \"You didn\u0027t tell me you had such good friends in Forks.\" I cringed, and then moaned. \"What hurts?\" she demanded anxiously, turning back to me. Edward\u0027s eyes flashed to my face. \"It\u0027s fine,\" I assured them. \"I just have to remember not to move.\" He lapsed back into his phony slumber. I took advantage of my mother\u0027s momentary distraction to keep the subject from returning to my less-than-candid behavior. \"Where\u0027s Phil?\" I asked quickly. \"Florida - oh, Bella! You\u0027ll never guess! Just when we were about to leave, the best news!\" \"Phil got signed?\" I guessed. \"Yes! How did you guess! The Suns, can you believe it?\" \"That\u0027s great, Mom,\" I said as enthusiastically as I could manage, though I had little idea what that meant. \"And you\u0027ll like Jacksonville so much,\" she gushed while I stared at her vacantly. \"I was a little bit worried when Phil started talking about Akron, what with the snow and everything, because you know how I hate the cold, but now Jacksonville! It\u0027s always sunny, and the humidity really isn\u0027t that bad. We found the cutest house, yellow, with white trim, and a porch just like in an old movie, and this huge oak tree, and it\u0027s just a few minutes from the ocean, and you\u0027ll have your own bathroom -\" \"Wait, Mom!\" I interrupted. Edward still had his eyes closed, but he looked too tense to pass as asleep. \"What are you talking about? I\u0027m not going to Florida. I live in Forks.\" \"But you don\u0027t have to anymore, silly,\" she laughed. \"Phil will be able to be around so much more now... we\u0027ve talked about it a lot, and what I\u0027m going to do is trade off on the away games, half the time with you, half the time with him.\" \"Mom.\" I hesitated, wondering how best to be diplomatic about this. \"I want to live in Forks. I\u0027m already settled in at school, and I have a couple of girlfriends\" - she glanced toward Edward again when I reminded her of friends, so I tried another direction - \"and Charlie needs me. He\u0027s just all alone up there, and he can\u0027t cook at all.\" \"You want to stay in Forks?\" she asked, bewildered. The idea was inconceivable to her. And then her eyes flickered back toward Edward. \"Why?\" \"I told you - school, Charlie - ouch!\" I\u0027d shrugged. Not a good idea. Her hands fluttered helplessly over me, trying to find a safe place to pat. She made do with my forehead; it was unbandaged. \"Bella, honey, you hate Forks,\" she reminded me. \"It\u0027s not so bad.\" She frowned and looked back and forth between Edward and me, this time very deliberately. \"Is it this boy?\" she whispered. I opened my mouth to lie, but her eyes were scrutinizing my face, and I knew she would see through that. \"He\u0027s part of it,\" I admitted. No need to confess how big a part. \"So, have you had a chance to talk with Edward?\" I asked. \"Yes.\" She hesitated, looking at his perfectly still form. \"And I want to talk to you about that.\" Uh-oh. \"What about?\" I asked. \"I think that boy is in love with you,\" she accused, keeping her voice low. \"I think so, too,\" I confided. \"And how do you feel about him?\" She only poorly concealed the raging curiosity in her voice. I sighed, looking away. As much as I loved my mom, this was not a conversation I wanted to have with her. \"I\u0027m pretty crazy about him.\" There - that sounded like something a teenager with her first boyfriend might say. \"Well, he seems very nice, and, my goodness, he\u0027s incredibly good-looking, but you\u0027re so young, Bella...\" Her voice was unsure; as far as I could remember, this was the first time since I was eight that she\u0027d come close to trying to sound like a parental authority. I recognized the reasonable-but-firm tone of voice from talks I\u0027d had with her about men. \"I know that, Mom. Don\u0027t worry about it. It\u0027s just a crush,\" I soothed her. \"That\u0027s right,\" she agreed, easily pleased. Then she sighed and glanced guiltily over her shoulder at the big, round clock on the wall. \"Do you need to go?\" She bit her lip. \"Phil\u0027s supposed to call in a little while... I didn\u0027t know you were going to wake up...\" \"No problem, Mom.\" I tried to tone down the relief so she wouldn\u0027t get her feelings hurt. \"I won\u0027t be alone.\" \"I\u0027ll be back soon. I\u0027ve been sleeping here, you know,\" she announced, proud of herself. \"Oh, Mom, you don\u0027t have to do that! You can sleep at home - I\u0027ll never notice.\" The swirl of painkillers in my brain was making it hard to concentrate even now, though, apparently, I\u0027d been sleeping for days. \"I was too nervous,\" she admitted sheepishly. \"There\u0027s been some crime in the neighborhood, and I don\u0027t like being there alone.\" \"Crime?\" I asked in alarm. \"Someone broke into that dance studio around the corner from the house and burned it to the ground - there\u0027s nothing left at all! And they left a stolen car right out front. Do you remember when you used to dance there, honey?\" \"I remember.\" I shivered, and winced. \"I can stay, baby, if you need me.\" \"No, Mom, I\u0027ll be fine. Edward will be with me.\" She looked like that might be why she wanted to stay. \"I\u0027ll be back tonight.\" It sounded as much like a warning as it sounded like a promise, and she glanced at Edward again as she said it. \"I love you, Mom.\" \"I love you, too, Bella. Try to be more careful when you walk, honey, I don\u0027t want to lose you.\" Edward\u0027s eyes stayed closed, but a wide grin flashed across his face. A nurse came bustling in then to check all my tubes and wires. My mother kissed my forehead, patted my gauze-wrapped hand, and left. The nurse was checking the paper readout on my heart monitor. \"Are you feeling anxious, honey? Your heart rate got a little high there.\" \"I\u0027m fine,\" I assured her. \"I\u0027ll tell your RN that you\u0027re awake. She\u0027ll be in to see you in a minute.\" As soon as she closed the door, Edward was at my side. \"You stole a car?\" I raised my eyebrows. He smiled, unrepentant. \"It was a good car, very fast.\" \"How was your nap?\" I asked. \"Interesting.\" His eyes narrowed. \"What?\" He looked down while he answered. \"I\u0027m surprised. I thought Florida... and your mother... well, I thought that\u0027s what you would want.\" I stared at him uncomprehendingly. \"But you\u0027d be stuck inside all day in Florida. You\u0027d only be able to come out at night, just like a real vampire.\" He almost smiled, but not quite. And then his face was grave. \"I would stay in Forks, Bella. Or somewhere like it,\" he explained. \"Someplace where I couldn\u0027t hurt you anymore.\" It didn\u0027t sink in at first. I continued to stare at him blankly as the words one by one clicked into place in my head like a ghastly puzzle. I was barely conscious of the sound of my heart accelerating, though, as my breathing became hyperventilation, I was aware of the sharp aching in my protesting ribs. He didn\u0027t say anything; he watched my face warily as the pain that had nothing to do with broken bones, pain that was infinitely worse, threatened to crush me. And then another nurse walked purposefully into the room. Edward sat still as stone as she took in my expression with a practiced eye before turning to the monitors. \"Time for more pain meds, sweetheart?\" she asked kindly, tapping the IV feed. \"No, no,\" I mumbled, trying to keep the agony out of my voice. \"I don\u0027t need anything.\" I couldn\u0027t afford to close my eyes now. \"No need to be brave, honey. It\u0027s better if you don\u0027t get too stressed out; you need to rest.\" She waited, but I just shook my head. \"Okay,\" she sighed. \"Hit the call button when you\u0027re ready.\" She gave Edward a stern look, and threw one more anxious glance at the machinery, before leaving. His cool hands were on my face; I stared at him with wild eyes. \"Shhh, Bella, calm down.\" \"Don\u0027t leave me,\" I begged in a broken voice. \"I won\u0027t,\" he promised. \"Now relax before I call the nurse back to sedate you.\" But my heart couldn\u0027t slow. \"Bella.\" He stroked my face anxiously. \"I\u0027m not going anywhere. I\u0027ll be right here as long as you need me.\" \"Do you swear you won\u0027t leave me?\" I whispered. I tried to control the gasping, at least. My ribs were throbbing. He put his hands on either side of my face and brought his face close to mine. His eyes were wide and serious. \"I swear.\" The smell of his breath was soothing. It seemed to ease the ache of my breathing. He continued to hold my gaze while my body slowly relaxed and the beeping returned to a normal pace. His eyes were dark, closer to black than gold today. \"Better?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" I said cautiously. He shook his head and muttered something unintelligible. I thought I picked out the word \"overreaction.\" \"Why did you say that?\" I whispered, trying to keep my voice from shaking. \"Are you tired of having to save me all the time? Do you want me to go away?\" \"No, I don\u0027t want to be without you, Bella, of course not. Be rational. And I have no problem with saving you, either - if it weren\u0027t for the fact that I was the one putting you in danger... that I\u0027m the reason that you\u0027re here.\" \"Yes, you are the reason.\" I frowned. \"The reason I\u0027m here - alive.\" \"Barely.\" His voice was just a whisper. \"Covered in gauze and plaster and hardly able to move.\" \"I wasn\u0027t referring to my most recent near-death experience,\" I said, growing irritated. \"I was thinking of the others - you can take your pick. If it weren\u0027t for you, I would be rotting away in the Forks cemetery.\" He winced at my words, but the haunted look didn\u0027t leave his eyes. \"That\u0027s not the worst part, though,\" he continued to whisper. He acted as if I hadn\u0027t spoken. \"Not seeing you there on the floor... crumpled and broken.\" His voice was choked. \"Not thinking I was too late. Not even hearing you scream in pain - all those unbearable memories that I\u0027ll carry with me for the rest of eternity. No, the very worst was feeling... knowing that I couldn\u0027t stop. Believing that I was going to kill you myself.\" \"But you didn\u0027t.\" \"I could have. So easily.\" I knew I needed to stay calm... but he was trying to talk himself into leaving me, and the panic fluttered in my lungs, trying to get out. \"Promise me,\" I whispered. \"What?\" \"You know what.\" I was starting to get angry now. He was so stubbornly determined to dwell on the negative. He heard the change in my tone. His eyes tightened. \"I don\u0027t seem to be strong enough to stay away from you, so I suppose that you\u0027ll get your way... whether it kills you or not,\" he added roughly. \"Good.\" He hadn\u0027t promised, though - a fact that I had not missed. The panic was only barely contained; I had no strength left to control the anger. \"You told me how you stopped... now I want to know why,\" I demanded. \"Why?\" he repeated warily. \"Why you did it. Why didn\u0027t you just let the venom spread? By now I would be just like you.\" Edward\u0027s eyes seemed to turn flat black, and I remembered that this was something he\u0027d never intended me to know. Alice must have been preoccupied by the things she\u0027d learned about herself... or she\u0027d been very careful with her thoughts around him - clearly, he\u0027d had no idea that she\u0027d filled me in on the mechanics of vampire conversions. He was surprised, and infuriated. His nostrils flared, his mouth looked as if it was chiseled from stone. He wasn\u0027t going to answer, that much was clear. \"I\u0027ll be the first to admit that I have no experience with relationships,\" I said. \"But it just seems logical... a man and woman have to be somewhat equal... as in, one of them can\u0027t always be swooping in and saving the other one. They have to save each other equally.\" He folded his arms on the side of my bed and rested his chin on his arms. His expression was smooth, the anger reined in. Evidently he\u0027d decided he wasn\u0027t angry with me. I hoped I\u0027d get a chance to warn Alice before he caught up with her. \"You have saved me,\" he said quietly. \"I can\u0027t always be Lois Lane,\" I insisted. \"I want to be Superman, too.\" \"You don\u0027t know what you\u0027re asking.\" His voice was soft; he stared intently at the edge of the pillowcase. \"I think I do.\" \"Bella, you don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve had almost ninety years to think about this, and I\u0027m still not sure.\" \"Do you wish that Carlisle hadn\u0027t saved you?\" \"No, I don\u0027t wish that.\" He paused before continuing. \"But my life was over. I wasn\u0027t giving anything up.\" \"You are my life. You\u0027re the only thing it would hurt me to lose.\" I was getting better at this. It was easy to admit how much I needed him. He was very calm, though. Decided. \"I can\u0027t do it, Bella. I won\u0027t do that to you.\" \"Why not?\" My throat rasped and the words weren\u0027t as loud as I\u0027d meant them to be. \"Don\u0027t tell me it\u0027s too hard! After today, or I guess it was a few days ago... anyway, after that, it should be nothing.\" He glared at me. \"And the pain?\" he asked. I blanched. I couldn\u0027t help it. But I tried to keep my expression from showing how clearly I remembered the feeling... the fire in my veins. \"That\u0027s my problem,\" I said. \"I can handle it.\" \"It\u0027s possible to take bravery to the point where it becomes insanity.\" \"It\u0027s not an issue. Three days. Big deal.\" Edward grimaced again as my words reminded him that I was more informed than he had ever intended me to be. I watched him repress the anger, watched as his eyes grew speculative. \"Charlie?\" he asked curtly. \"Ren¨¦e?\" Minutes passed in silence as I struggled to answer his question. I opened my mouth, but no sound came out. I closed it again. He waited, and his expression became triumphant because he knew I had no true answer. \"Look, that\u0027s not an issue either,\" I finally muttered; my voice was as unconvincing as it always was when I lied. \"Ren¨¦e has always made the choices that work for her - she\u0027d want me to do the same. And Charlie\u0027s resilient, he\u0027s used to being on his own. I can\u0027t take care of them forever. I have my own life to live.\" \"Exactly,\" he snapped. \"And I won\u0027t end it for you.\" \"If you\u0027re waiting for me to be on my deathbed, I\u0027ve got news for you! I was just there!\" \"You\u0027re going to recover,\" he reminded me. I took a deep breath to calm myself, ignoring the spasm of pain it triggered. I stared at him, and he stared back. There was no compromise in his face. \"No,\" I said slowly. \"I\u0027m not.\" His forehead creased. \"Of course you are. You may have a scar or two...\" \"You\u0027re wrong,\" I insisted. \"I\u0027m going to die.\" \"Really, Bella.\" He was anxious now. \"You\u0027ll be out of here in a few days. Two week at most.\" I glared at him. \"I may not die now... but I\u0027m going to die sometime. Every minute of the day, I get closer. And I\u0027m going to get old.\" He frowned as what I was saying sunk in, pressing his long fingers to his temples and closing his eyes. \"That\u0027s how it\u0027s supposed to happen. How it should happen. How it would have happened if I didn\u0027t exist - and I shouldn\u0027t exist.\" I snorted. He opened his eyes in surprise. \"That\u0027s stupid. That\u0027s like going to someone who\u0027s just won the lottery, taking their money, and saying, \u0027Look, let\u0027s just go back to how things should be. It\u0027s better that way.\u0027 And I\u0027m not buying it.\" \"I\u0027m hardly a lottery prize,\" he growled. \"That\u0027s right. You\u0027re much better.\" He rolled his eyes and set his lips. \"Bella, we\u0027re not having this discussion anymore. I refuse to damn you to an eternity of night and that\u0027s the end of it.\" \"If you think that\u0027s the end, then you don\u0027t know me very well,\" I warned him. \"You\u0027re not the only vampire I know.\" His eyes went black again. \"Alice wouldn\u0027t dare.\" And for a moment he looked so frightening that I couldn\u0027t help but believe it - I couldn\u0027t imagine someone brave enough to cross him. \"Alice already saw it, didn\u0027t she?\" I guessed. \"That\u0027s why the things she says upset you. She knows I\u0027m going to be like you... someday.\" \"She\u0027s wrong. She also saw you dead, but that didn\u0027t happen, either.\" \"You\u0027ll never catch me betting against Alice.\" We stared at each other for a very long time. It was quiet except for the whirring of the machines, the beeping, the dripping, the ticking of the big clock on the wall. Finally, his expression softened. \"So where does that leave us?\" I wondered. He chuckled humorlessly. \"I believe it\u0027s called an impasse.\" I sighed. \"Ouch,\" I muttered. \"How are you feeling?\" he asked, eyeing the button for the nurse. \"I\u0027m fine,\" I lied. \"I don\u0027t believe you,\" he said gently. \"I\u0027m not going back to sleep.\" \"You need rest. All this arguing isn\u0027t good for you.\" \"So give in,\" I hinted. \"Nice try.\" He reached for the button. \"No!\" He ignored me. \"Yes?\" the speaker on the wall squawked. \"I think we\u0027re ready for more pain medication,\" he said calmly, ignoring my furious expression. \"I\u0027ll send in the nurse.\" The voice sounded very bored. \"I won\u0027t take it,\" I promised. He looked toward the sack of fluids hanging beside my bed. \"I don\u0027t think they\u0027re going to ask you to swallow anything.\" My heart rate started to climb. He read the fear in my eyes, and sighed in frustration. \"Bella, you\u0027re in pain. You need to relax so you can heal. Why are you being so difficult? They\u0027re not going to put any more needles in you now.\" \"I\u0027m not afraid of the needles,\" I mumbled. \"I\u0027m afraid to close my eyes.\" Then he smiled his crooked smile, and took my face between his hands. \"I told you I\u0027m not going anywhere. Don\u0027t be afraid. As long as it makes you happy, I\u0027ll be here.\" I smiled back, ignoring the ache in my cheeks. \"You\u0027re talking about forever, you know.\" \"Oh, you\u0027ll get over it - it\u0027s just a crush.\" I shook my head in disbelief- it made me dizzy. \"I was shocked when Ren¨¦e swallowed that one. I know you know better.\" \"That\u0027s the beautiful thing about being human,\" he told me. \"Things change.\" My eyes narrowed. \"Don\u0027t hold your breath.\" He was laughing when the nurse came in, brandishing a syringe. \"Excuse me,\" she said brusquely to Edward. He got up and crossed to the end of the small room, leaning against the wall. He folded his arms and waited. I kept my eyes on him, still apprehensive. He met my gaze calmly. \"Here you go, honey.\" The nurse smiled as she injected the medicine into my tube. \"You\u0027ll feel better now.\" \"Thanks,\" I mumbled, unenthusiastic. It didn\u0027t take long. I could feel the drowsiness trickling through my bloodstream almost immediately. \"That ought to do it,\" she muttered as my eyelids drooped. She must have left the room, because something cold and smooth touched my face. \"Stay.\" The word was slurred. \"I will,\" he promised. His voice was beautiful, like a lullaby. \"Like I said, as long as it makes you happy... as long as it\u0027s what\u0027s best for you.\" I tried to shake my head, but it was too heavy. \"\u0027S not the same thing,\" I mumbled. He laughed. \"Don\u0027t worry about that now, Bella. You can argue with me when you wake up.\" I think I smiled. \u0027\"Kay.\" I could feel his lips at my ear. \"I love you,\" he whispered. \"Me, too.\" \"I know,\" he laughed quietly. I turned my head slightly... searching. He knew what I was after. His lips touched mine gently. \"Thanks,\" I sighed. \"Anytime.\" I wasn\u0027t really there at all anymore. But I fought against the stupor weakly. There was just one more thing I wanted to tell him. \"Edward?\" I struggled to pronounce his name clearly. \"Yes?\" \"I\u0027m betting on Alice,\" I mumbled. And then the night closed over me. EPILOGUE:AN OCCASION Edward helped me into his car, being very careful of the wisps of silk and chiffon, the flowers he\u0027d just pinned into my elaborately styled curls, and my bulky walking cast. He ignored the angry set of my mouth. When he had me settled, he got in the driver\u0027s seat and headed back out the long, narrow drive. \"At what point exactly are you going to tell me what\u0027s going on?\" I asked grumpily. I really hated surprises. And he knew that. \"I\u0027m shocked that you haven\u0027t figured it out yet.\" He threw a mocking smile in my direction, and my breath caught in my throat. Would I ever get used to his perfection? \"I did mention that you looked very nice, didn\u0027t I?\" I verified. \"Yes.\" He grinned again. I\u0027d never seen him dress in black before, and, with the contrast against his pale skin, his beauty was absolutely surreal. That much I couldn\u0027t deny, even if the fact that he was wearing a tuxedo made me very nervous. Not quite as nervous as the dress. Or the shoe. Only one shoe, as my other foot was still securely encased in plaster. But the stiletto heel, held on only by satin ribbons, certainly wasn\u0027t going to help me as I tried to hobble around. \"I\u0027m not coming over anymore if Alice is going to treat me like Guinea Pig Barbie when I do,\" I griped. I\u0027d spent the better part of the day in Alice\u0027s staggeringly vast bathroom, a helpless victim as she played hairdresser and cosmetician. Whenever I fidgeted or complained, she reminded me that she didn\u0027t have any memories of being human, and asked me not to ruin her vicarious fun. Then she\u0027d dressed me in the most ridiculous dress - deep blue, frilly and off the shoulders, with French tags I couldn\u0027t read - a dress more suitable for a runway than Forks. Nothing good could come of our formal attire, of that I was sure. Unless... but I was afraid to put my suspicions into words, even in my own head. I was distracted then by the sound of a phone ringing. Edward pulled his cell phone from a pocket inside his jacket, looking briefly at the caller ID before answering. \"Hello, Charlie,\" he said warily. \"Charlie?\" I frowned. Charlie had been... difficult since my return to Forks. He had compartmentalized my bad experience into two defined reactions. Toward Carlisle he was almost worshipfully grateful. On the other hand, he was stubbornly convinced that Edward was at fault - because, if not for him, I wouldn\u0027t have left home in the first place. And Edward was far from disagreeing with him. These days I had rules that hadn\u0027t existed before: curfews... visiting hours. Something Charlie was saying made Edward\u0027s eyes widen in disbelief, and then a grin spread across his face. \"You\u0027re kidding!\" He laughed. \"What is it?\" I demanded. He ignored me. \"Why don\u0027t you let me talk to him?\" Edward suggested with evident pleasure. He waited for a few seconds. \"Hello, Tyler, this is Edward Cullen.\" His voice was very friendly, on the surface. I knew it well enough to catch the soft edge of menace. What was Tyler doing at my house? The awful truth began to dawn on me. I looked again at the inappropriate dress Alice had forced me into. \"I\u0027m sorry if there\u0027s been some kind of miscommunication, but Bella is unavailable tonight.\" Edward\u0027s tone changed, and the threat in his voice was suddenly much more evident as he continued. \"To be perfectly honest, she\u0027ll be unavailable every night, as far as anyone besides myself is concerned. No offense. And I\u0027m sorry about your evening.\" He didn\u0027t sound sorry at all. And then he snapped the phone shut, a huge smirk on his face. My face and neck flushed crimson with anger. I could feel the rage-induced tears starting to fill my eyes. He looked at me in surprise. \"Was that last part a bit too much? I didn\u0027t mean to offend you.\" I ignored that. \"You\u0027re taking me to the prom!\" I yelled. It was embarrassingly obvious now. If I\u0027d been paying any attention at all, I\u0027m sure I would have noticed the date on the posters that decorated the school buildings. But I\u0027d never dreamed he was thinking of subjecting me to this. Didn\u0027t he know me at all? He wasn\u0027t expecting the force of my reaction, that was clear. He pressed his lips together and his eyes narrowed. \"Don\u0027t be difficult, Bella.\" My eyes flashed to the window; we were halfway to the school already. \"Why are you doing this to me?\" I demanded in horror. He gestured to his tuxedo. \"Honestly, Bella, what did you think we were doing?\" I was mortified. First, because I\u0027d missed the obvious. And also because the vague suspicions - expectations, really - that I\u0027d been forming all day, as Alice tried to transform me into a beauty queen, were so far wide of the mark. My half-fearful hopes seemed very silly now. I\u0027d guessed there was some kind of occasion brewing. But prom! That was the furthest thing from my mind. The angry tears rolled over my cheeks. I remembered with dismay that I was very uncharacteristically wearing mascara. I wiped quickly under my eyes to prevent any smudges. My hand was unblackened when I pulled it away; maybe Alice had known I would need waterproof makeup. \"This is completely ridiculous. Why are you crying?\" he demanded in frustration. \"Because I\u0027m mad!\" \"Bella.\" He turned the full force of his scorching golden eyes on me. \"What?\" I muttered, distracted. \"Humor me,\" he insisted. His eyes were melting all my fury. It was impossible to fight with him when he cheated like that. I gave in with poor grace. \"Fine,\" I pouted, unable to glare as effectively as I would have liked. \"I\u0027ll go quietly. But you\u0027ll see. I\u0027m way overdue for more bad luck. I\u0027ll probably break my other leg. Look at this shoe! It\u0027s a death trap!\" I held out my good leg as evidence. \"Hmmm.\" He stared at my leg longer than was necessary. \"Remind me to thank Alice for that tonight.\" \"Alice is going to be there?\" That comforted me slightly. \"With Jasper, and Emmett... and Rosalie,\" he admitted. The feeling of comfort disappeared. There had been no progress with Rosalie, though I was on quite good terms with her sometimes-husband. Emmett enjoyed having me around - he thought my bizarre human reactions were hilarious... or maybe it was just the fact that I fell down a lot that he found so funny. Rosalie acted as if I didn\u0027t exist. While I shook my head to dispel the direction my thoughts had taken, I thought of something else. \"Is Charlie in on this?\" I asked, suddenly suspicious. \"Of course.\" He grinned, and then chuckled. \"Apparently Tyler wasn\u0027t, though.\" I gritted my teeth. How Tyler could be so delusional, I couldn\u0027t imagine. At school, where Charlie couldn\u0027t interfere, Edward and I were inseparable - except for those rare sunny days. We were at the school now; Rosalie\u0027s red convertible was conspicuous in the parking lot. The clouds were thin today, a few streaks of sunlight escaping through far away in the west. He got out and walked around the car to open my door. He held out his hand. I sat stubbornly in my seat, arms folded, feeling a secret twinge of smugness. The lot was crowded with people in formal dress: witnesses. He couldn\u0027t remove me forcibly from the car as he might have if we\u0027d been alone. He sighed. \"When someone wants to kill you, you\u0027re brave as a lion - and then when someone mentions dancing...\" He shook his head. I gulped. Dancing. \"Bella, I won\u0027t let anything hurt you - not even yourself. I won\u0027t let go of you once, I promise.\" I thought about that and suddenly felt much better. He could see that in my face. \"There, now,\" he said gently, \"it won\u0027t be so bad.\" He leaned down and wrapped one arm around my waist. I took his other hand and let him lift me from the car. He kept his arm tightly around me, supporting me as I limped toward the school. In Phoenix, they held proms in hotel ballrooms. This dance was in the gym, of course. It was probably the only room in town big enough for a dance. When we got inside, I giggled. There were actual balloon arches and twisted garlands of pastel crepe paper festooning the walls. \"This looks like a horror movie waiting to happen,\" I snickered. \"Well,\" he muttered as we slowly approached the ticket table - he was carrying most of my weight, but I still had to shuffle and wobble my feet forward - \"there are more than enough vampires present.\" I looked at the dance floor; a wide gap had formed in the center of the floor, where two couples whirled gracefully. The other dancers pressed to the sides of the room to give them space - no one wanted to stand in contrast with such radiance. Emmett and Jasper were intimidating and flawless in classic tuxedos. Alice was striking in a black satin dress with geometric cutouts that bared large triangles of her snowy white skin. And Rosalie was... well, Rosalie. She was beyond belief. Her vivid scarlet dress was backless, tight to her calves where it flared into a wide ruffled train, with a neckline that plunged to her waist. I pitied every girl in the room, myself included. \"Do you want me to bolt the doors so you can massacre the unsuspecting townsfolk?\" I whispered conspiratorially. \"And where do you fit into that scheme?\" He glared. \"Oh, I\u0027m with the vampires, of course.\" He smiled reluctantly. \"Anything to get out of dancing.\" \"Anything.\" He bought our tickets, then turned me toward the dance floor. I cringed against his arm and dragged my feet. \"I\u0027ve got all night,\" he warned. Eventually he towed me out to where his family was twirling elegantly - if in a style totally unsuitable to the present time and music. I watched in horror. \"Edward.\" My throat was so dry I could only manage a whisper. \"I honestly can\u0027t dance!\" I could feel the panic bubbling up inside my chest. \"Don\u0027t worry, silly,\" he whispered back. \"I can.\" He put my arms around his neck and lifted me to slide his feet under mine. And then we were whirling, too. \"I feel like I\u0027m five years old,\" I laughed after a few minutes of effortless waltzing. \"You don\u0027t look five,\" he murmured, pulling me closer for a second, so that my feet were briefly a foot from the ground. Alice caught my eye on a turn and smiled in encouragement - I smiled back. I was surprised to realize that I was actually enjoying myself... a little. \"Okay, this isn\u0027t half bad,\" I admitted. But Edward was staring toward the doors, and his face was angry. \"What is it?\" I wondered aloud. I followed his gaze, disoriented by the spinning, but finally I could see what was bothering him. Jacob Black, not in a tux, but in a long-sleeved white shirt and tie, his hair smoothed back into his usual ponytail, was crossing the floor toward us. After the first shock of recognition, I couldn\u0027t help but feel bad for Jacob. He was clearly uncomfortable - excruciatingly so. His face was apologetic as his eyes met mine. Edward snarled very quietly. \"Behave!\" I hissed. Edward\u0027s voice was scathing. \"He wants to chat with you.\" Jacob reached us then, the embarrassment and apology even more evident on his face. \"Hey, Bella, I was hoping you would be here.\" Jacob sounded like he\u0027d been hoping the exact opposite. But his smile was just as warm as ever. \"Hi, Jacob.\" I smiled back. \"What\u0027s up?\" \"Can I cut in?\" he asked tentatively, glancing at Edward for the first time. I was shocked to notice that Jacob didn\u0027t have to look up. He must have grown half a foot since the first time I\u0027d seen him. Edward\u0027s face was composed, his expression blank. His only answer was to set me carefully on my feet, and take a step back. \"Thanks,\" Jacob said amiably. Edward just nodded, looking at me intently before he turned to walk away. Jacob put his hands on my waist, and I reached up to put my hands on his shoulders. \"Wow, Jake, how tall are you now?\" He was smug. \"Six-two.\" We weren\u0027t really dancing - my leg made that impossible. Instead we swayed awkwardly from side to side without moving our feet. It was just as well; the recent growth spurt had left him looking gangly and uncoordinated, he was probably no better a dancer than I was. \"So, how did you end up here tonight?\" I asked without true curiosity. Considering Edward\u0027s reaction, I could guess. \"Can you believe my dad paid me twenty bucks to come to your prom?\" he admitted, slightly ashamed. \"Yes, I can,\" I muttered. \"Well, I hope you\u0027re enjoying yourself, at least. Seen anything you like?\" I teased, nodding toward a group of girls lined up against the wall like pastel confections. \"Yeah,\" he sighed. \"But she\u0027s taken.\" He glanced down to meet my curious gaze for just a second - then we both looked away, embarrassed. \"You look really pretty, by the way,\" he added shyly. \"Um, thanks. So why did Billy pay you to come here?\" I asked quickly, though I knew the answer. Jacob didn\u0027t seem grateful for the subject change; he looked away, uncomfortable again. \"He said it was a \u0027safe\u0027 place to talk to you. I swear the old man is losing his mind.\" I joined in his laughter weakly. \"Anyway, he said that if I told you something, he would get me that master cylinder I need,\" he confessed with a sheepish grin. \"Tell me, then. I want you to get your car finished.\" I grinned back. At least Jacob didn\u0027t believe any of this. It made the situation a bit easier. Against the wall, Edward was watching my face, his own face expressionless. I saw a sophomore in a pink dress eyeing him with timid speculation, but he didn\u0027t seem to be aware of her. Jacob looked away again, ashamed. \"Don\u0027t get mad, okay?\" \"There\u0027s no way I\u0027ll be mad at you, Jacob,\" I assured him. \"I won\u0027t even be mad at Billy. Just say what you have to.\" \"Well - this is so stupid, I\u0027m sorry, Bella - he wants you to break up with your boyfriend. He asked me to tell you \u0027please.\u0027\" He shook his head in disgust. \"He\u0027s still superstitious, eh?\" \"Yeah. He was... kind of over the top when you got hurt down in Phoenix. He didn\u0027t believe...\"Jacob trailed off self-consciously. My eyes narrowed. \"I fell.\" \"I know that,\" Jacob said quickly. \"He thinks Edward had something to do with me getting hurt.\" It wasn\u0027t a question, and despite my promise, I was angry. Jacob wouldn\u0027t meet my eyes. We weren\u0027t even bothering to sway to the music, though his hands were still on my waist, and mine around his neck. \"Look, Jacob, I know Billy probably won\u0027t believe this, but just so you know\" - he looked at me now, responding to the new earnestness in my voice - \"Edward really did save my life. If it weren\u0027t for Edward and his father, I\u0027d be dead.\" \"I know,\" he claimed, but he sounded like my sincere words had affected him some. Maybe he\u0027d be able to convince Billy of this much, at least. \"Hey, I\u0027m sorry you had to come do this, Jacob,\" I apologized. \"At any rate, you get your parts, right?\" \"Yeah,\" he muttered. He was still looking awkward... upset. \"There\u0027s more?\" I asked in disbelief. \"Forget it,\" he mumbled, \"I\u0027ll get a job and save the money myself.\" I glared at him until he met my gaze. \"Just spit it out, Jacob.\" \"It\u0027s so bad.\" \"I don\u0027t care. Tell me,\" I insisted. \"Okay... but, geez, this sounds bad.\" He shook his head. \"He said to tell you, no, to warn you, that - and this is his plural, not mine\" - he lifted one hand from my waist and made little quotations marks in the air - \u0027\"We\u0027ll be watching.\u0027\" He watched warily for my reaction. It sounded like something from a mafia movie. I laughed out loud. \"Sorry you had to do this, Jake,\" I snickered. \"I don\u0027t mind that much.\" He grinned in relief. His eyes were appraising as they raked quickly over my dress. \"So, should I tell him you said to butt the hell out?\" he asked hopefully. \"No,\" I sighed. \"Tell him I said thanks. I know he means well.\" The song ended, and I dropped my arms. His hands hesitated at my waist, and he glanced at my bum leg. \"Do you want to dance again? Or can I help you get somewhere?\" Edward answered for me. \"That\u0027s all right, Jacob. I\u0027ll take it from here.\" Jacob flinched, and stared wide-eyed at Edward, who stood just beside us. \"Hey, I didn\u0027t see you there,\" he mumbled. \"I guess I\u0027ll see you around, Bella.\" He stepped back, waving halfheartedly. I smiled. \"Yeah, I\u0027ll see you later.\" \"Sorry,\" he said again before he turned for the door. Edward\u0027s arms wound around me as the next song started. It was a little up-tempo for slow dancing, but that didn\u0027t seem to concern him. I leaned my head against his chest, content. \"Feeling better?\" I teased. \"Not really,\" he said tersely. \"Don\u0027t be mad at Billy,\" I sighed. \"He just worries about me for Charlie\u0027s sake. It\u0027s nothing personal.\" \"I\u0027m not mad at Billy,\" he corrected in a clipped voice. \"But his son is irritating me.\" I pulled back to look at him. His face was very serious. \"Why?\" \"First of all, he made me break my promise.\" I stared at him in confusion. He half-smiled. \"I promised I wouldn\u0027t let go of you tonight,\" he explained. \"Oh. Well, I forgive you.\" \"Thanks. But there\u0027s something else.\" Edward frowned. I waited patiently. \"He called you pretty,\" he finally continued, his frown deepening. \"That\u0027s practically an insult, the way you look right now. You\u0027re much more than beautiful.\" I laughed. \"You might be a little biased.\" \"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s it. Besides, I have excellent eyesight.\" We were twirling again, my feet on his as he held me close. \"So are you going to explain the reason for all of this?\" I wondered. He looked down at me, confused, and I glared meaningfully at the crepe paper. He considered for a moment, and then changed direction, spinning me through the crowd to the back door of the gym. I caught a glimpse of Jessica and Mike dancing, staring at me curiously. Jessica waved, and I smiled back quickly. Angela was there, too, looking blissfully happy in the arms of little Ben Cheney; she didn\u0027t look up from his eyes, a head lower than hers. Lee and Samantha, Lauren, glaring toward us, with Conner; I could name every face that spiraled past me. And then we were outdoors, in the cool, dim light of a fading sunset. As soon as we were alone, he swung me up into his arms, and carried me across the dark grounds till he reached the bench beneath the shadow of the madrone trees. He sat there, keeping me cradled against his chest. The moon was already up, visible through the gauzy clouds, and his face glowed pale in the white light. His mouth was hard, his eyes troubled. \"The point?\" I prompted softly. He ignored me, staring up at the moon. \"Twilight, again,\" he murmured. \"Another ending. No matter how perfect the day is, it always has to end.\" \"Some things don\u0027t have to end,\" I muttered through my teeth, instantly tense. He sighed. \"I brought you to the prom,\" he said slowly, finally answering my question, \"because I don\u0027t want you to miss anything. I don\u0027t want my presence to take anything away from you, if I can help it. I want you to be human. I want your life to continue as it would have if I\u0027d died in nineteen-eighteen like I should have.\" I shuddered at his words, and then shook my head angrily. \"In what strange parallel dimension would I ever have gone to prom of my own free will? If you weren\u0027t a thousand times stronger than me, I would never have let you get away with this.\" He smiled briefly, but it didn\u0027t touch his eyes. \"It wasn\u0027t so bad, you said so yourself.\" \"That\u0027s because I was with you.\" We were quiet for a minute; he stared at the moon and I stared at him. I wished there was some way to explain how very uninterested I was in a normal human life. \"Will you tell me something?\" he asked, glancing down at me with a slight smile. \"Don\u0027t I always?\" \"Just promise you\u0027ll tell me,\" he insisted, grinning. I knew I was going to regret this almost instantly. \"Fine.\" \"You seemed honestly surprised when you figured out that I was taking you here,\" he began. \"I was,\" I interjected. \"Exactly,\" he agreed. \"But you must have had some other theory... I\u0027m curious - what did you think I was dressing you up for?\" Yes, instant regret. I pursed my lips, hesitating. \"I don\u0027t want to tell you.\" \"You promised,\" he objected. \"I know.\" \"What\u0027s the problem?\" I knew he thought it was mere embarrassment holding me back. \"I think it will make you mad - or sad.\" His brows pulled together over his eyes as he thought that through. \"I still want to know. Please?\" I sighed. He waited. \"Well... I assumed it was some kind of... occasion. But I didn\u0027t think it would be some trite human thing... prom!\" I scoffed. \"Human?\" he asked flatly. He\u0027d picked up on the key word. I looked down at my dress, fidgeting with a stray piece of chiffon. He waited in silence. \"Okay,\" I confessed in a rush. \"So I was hoping that you might have changed your mind... that you were going to change me, after all.\" A dozen emotions played across his face. Some I recognized: anger... pain... and then he seemed to collect himself and his expression became amused. \"You thought that would be a black tie occasion, did you?\" he teased, touching the lapel of his tuxedo jacket. I scowled to hide my embarrassment. \"I don\u0027t know how these things work. To me, at least, it seems more rational than prom does.\" He was still grinning. \"It\u0027s not funny,\" I said. \"No, you\u0027re right, it\u0027s not,\" he agreed, his smile fading. \"I\u0027d rather treat it like a joke, though, than believe you\u0027re serious.\" \"But I am serious.\" He sighed deeply. \"I know. And you\u0027re really that willing?\" The pain was back in his eyes. I bit my lip and nodded. \"So ready for this to be the end,\" he murmured, almost to himself, \"for this to be the twilight of your life, though your life has barely started. You\u0027re ready to give up everything.\" \"It\u0027s not the end, it\u0027s the beginning,\" I disagreed under my breath. \"I\u0027m not worth it,\" he said sadly. \"Do you remember when you told me that I didn\u0027t see myself very clearly?\" I asked, raising my eyebrows. \"You obviously have the same blindness.\" \"I know what I am.\" I sighed. But his mercurial mood shifted on me. He pursed his lips, and his eyes were probing. He examined my face for a long moment. \"You\u0027re ready now, then?\" he asked. \"Um.\" I gulped. \"Yes?\" He smiled, and inclined his head slowly until his cold lips brushed against the skin just under the corner of my jaw. \"Right now?\" he whispered, his breath blowing cool on my neck. I shivered involuntarily. \"Yes,\" I whispered, so my voice wouldn\u0027t have a chance to break. If he thought I was bluffing, he was going to be disappointed. I\u0027d already made this decision, and I was sure. It didn\u0027t matter that my body was rigid as a plank, my hands balled into fists, my breathing erratic... He chuckled darkly, and leaned away. His face did look disappointed. \"You can\u0027t really believe that I would give in so easily,\" he said with a sour edge to his mocking tone. \"A girl can dream.\" His eyebrows rose. \"Is that what you dream about? Being a monster?\" \"Not exactly,\" I said, frowning at his word choice. Monster, indeed. \"Mostly I dream about being with you forever.\" His expression changed, softened and saddened by the subtle ache in my voice. \"Bella.\" His fingers lightly traced the shape of my lips. \"I will stay with you - isn\u0027t that enough?\" I smiled under his fingertips. \"Enough for now.\" He frowned at my tenacity. No one was going to surrender tonight. He exhaled, and the sound was practically a growl. I touched his face. \"Look,\" I said. \"I love you more than everything else in the world combined. Isn\u0027t that enough?\" \"Yes, it is enough,\" he answered, smiling. \"Enough for forever.\" And he leaned down to press his cold lips once more to my throat.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twilight-twilight-1/page-24.html","bookId":2023,"book":{"id":2023,"title":"Twilight (Twilight #1)","description":"Storyline: Twilight is a young-adult vampire-romance novel by author Stephenie Meyer.
