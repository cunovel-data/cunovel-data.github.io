I lay in my bed and listened to the quiet voices of Alice and Jasper in the other room. That they were loud enough for me to hear at all was strange. I rolled till my feet touched the floor and then staggered to the living room.\n The clock on the TV said it was just after two in the morning. Alice and Jasper were sitting together on the sofa, Alice sketching again while Jasper looked over her shoulder. They didn\u0027t look up when I entered, too engrossed in Alice\u0027s work.\n I crept to Jasper\u0027s side to peek.\n \"Did she see something more?\" I asked him quietly.\n \"Yes. Something\u0027s brought him back to the room with the VCR, but it\u0027s light now.\"\n I watched as Alice drew a square room with dark beams across its low ceiling. The walls were paneled in wood, a little too dark, out of date. The floor had a dark carpet with a pattern in it. There was a large window against the south wall, and an opening through the west wall led to the living room. One side of that entrance was stone - a large tan stone fireplace that was open to both rooms. The focus of the room from this perspective, the TV and VCR, balanced on a too-small wooden stand, were in the southwest corner of the room. An aged sectional sofa curved around in front of the TV, a round coffee table in front of it.\n \"The phone goes there,\" I whispered, pointing.\n Two pairs of eternal eyes stared at me.\n \"That\u0027s my mother\u0027s house.\"\n Alice was already off the couch, phone in hand, dialing. I stared at the precise rendering of my mother\u0027s family room. Uncharacteristically, Jasper slid closer to me. He lightly touched his hand to my shoulder, and the physical contact seemed to make his calming influence stronger. The panic stayed dull, unfocused.\n Alice\u0027s lips were trembling with the speed of her words, the low buzzing impossible to decipher. I couldn\u0027t concentrate.\n \"Bella,\" Alice said. I looked at her numbly.\n \"Bella, Edward is coming to get you. He and Emmett and Carlisle are going to take you somewhere, to hide you for a while.\"\n \"Edward is coming?\" The words were like a life vest, holding my head above the flood.\n \"Yes, he\u0027s catching the first flight out of Seattle. We\u0027ll meet him at the airport, and you\u0027ll leave with him.\"\n \"But, my mother... he came here for my mother, Alice!\" Despite Jasper, the hysteria bubbled up in my voice.\n \"Jasper and I will stay till she\u0027s safe.\"\n \"I can\u0027t win, Alice. You can\u0027t guard everyone I know forever. Don\u0027t you see what he\u0027s doing? He\u0027s not tracking me at all. He\u0027ll find someone, he\u0027ll hurt someone I love... Alice, I can\u0027t -\"\n \"We\u0027ll catch him, Bella,\" she assured me.\n \"And what if you get hurt, Alice? Do you think that\u0027s okay with me? Do you think it\u0027s only my human family he can hurt me with?\"\n Alice looked meaningfully at Jasper. A deep, heavy fog of lethargy washed over me, and my eyes closed without my permission. My mind struggled against the fog, realizing what was happening. I forced my eyes open and stood up, stepping away from Jasper\u0027s hand.\n \"I don\u0027t want to go back to sleep,\" I snapped.\n I walked to my room and shut the door, slammed it really, so I could be free to go to pieces privately. This time Alice didn\u0027t follow me. For three and a half hours I stared at the wall, curled in a ball, rocking. My mind went around in circles, trying to come up with some way out of this nightmare. There was no escape, no reprieve. I could see only one possible end looming darkly in my future. The only question was how many other people would be hurt before I reached it.\n The only solace, the only hope I had left, was knowing that I would see Edward soon. Maybe, if I could just see his face again, I would also be able to see the solution that eluded me now.\n When the phone rang, I returned to the front room, a little ashamed of my behavior. I hoped I hadn\u0027t offended either of them, that they would know how grateful I was for the sacrifices they were making on my account.\n Alice was talking as rapidly as ever, but what caught my attention was that, for the first time, Jasper was not in the room. I looked at the clock - it was five-thirty in the morning.\n \"They\u0027re just boarding their plane,\" Alice told me. \"They\u0027ll land at nine-forty-five.\" Just a few more hours to keep breathing till he was here.\n \"Where\u0027s Jasper?\"\n \"He went to check out.\"\n \"You aren\u0027t staying here?\"\n \"No, we\u0027re relocating closer to your mother\u0027s house.\"\n My stomach twisted uneasily at her words.\n But the phone rang again, distracting me. She looked surprised, but I was already walking forward, reaching hopefully for the phone.\n \"Hello?\" Alice asked. \"No, she\u0027s right here.\" She held the phone out to me. Your mother, she mouthed.\n \"Hello?\"\n \"Bella? Bella?\" It was my mother\u0027s voice, in a familiar tone I had heard a thousand times in my childhood, anytime I\u0027d gotten too close to the edge of the sidewalk or strayed out of her sight in a crowded place. It was the sound of panic.\n I sighed. I\u0027d been expecting this, though I\u0027d tried to make my message as unalarming as possible without lessening the urgency of it.\n \"Calm down, Mom,\" I said in my most soothing voice, walking slowly away from Alice. I wasn\u0027t sure if I could lie as convincingly with her eyes on me. \"Everything is fine, okay? Just give me a minute and I\u0027ll explain everything, I promise.\"\n I paused, surprised that she hadn\u0027t interrupted me yet.\n \"Mom?\"\n \"Be very careful not to say anything until I tell you to.\" The voice I heard now was as unfamiliar as it was unexpected. It was a man\u0027s tenor voice, a very pleasant, generic voice - the kind of voice that you heard in the background of luxury car commercials. He spoke very quickly.\n \"Now, I don\u0027t need to hurt your mother, so please do exactly as I say, and she\u0027ll be fine.\" He paused for a minute while I listened in mute horror. \"That\u0027s very good,\" he congratulated. \"Now repeat after me, and do try to sound natural. Please say, \u0027No, Mom, stay where you are.\u0027\"\n \"No, Mom, stay where you are.\" My voice was barely more than a whisper.\n \"I can see this is going to be difficult.\" The voice was amused, still light and friendly. \"Why don\u0027t you walk into another room now so your face doesn\u0027t ruin everything? There\u0027s no reason for your mother to suffer. As you\u0027re walking, please say, \u0027Mom, please listen to me.\u0027 Say it now.\"\n \"Mom, please listen to me,\" my voice pleaded. I walked very slowly to the bedroom, feeling Alice\u0027s worried stare on my back. I shut the door behind me, trying to think clearly through the terror that gripped my brain.\n \"There now, are you alone? Just answer yes or no.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"But they can still hear you, I\u0027m sure.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"All right, then,\" the agreeable voice continued, \"say, \u0027Mom, trust me.\u0027\"\n \"Mom, trust me.\"\n \"This worked out rather better than I expected. I was prepared to wait, but your mother arrived ahead of schedule. It\u0027s easier this way, isn\u0027t it? Less suspense, less anxiety for you.\"\n I waited.\n \"Now I want you to listen very carefully. I\u0027m going to need you to get away from your friends; do you think you can do that? Answer yes or no.\"\n \"No.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry to hear that. I was hoping you would be a little more creative than that. Do you think you could get away from them if your mother\u0027s life depended on it? Answer yes or no.\"\n Somehow, there had to be a way. I remembered that we were going to the airport. Sky Harbor International Airport: crowded, confusingly laid out...\n \"Yes.\"\n \"That\u0027s better. I\u0027m sure it won\u0027t be easy, but if I get the slightest\n hint that you have any company, well, that would be very bad for your mother,\" the friendly voice promised. \"You must know enough about us by now to realize how quickly I would know if you tried to bring anyone along with you. And how little time I would need to deal with your mother if that was the case. Do you understand? Answer yes or no.\"\n \"Yes.\" My voice broke.\n \"Very good, Bella. Now this is what you have to do. I want you to go to your mother\u0027s house. Next to the phone there will be a number. Call it, and I\u0027ll tell you where to go from there.\" I already knew where I would go, and where this would end. But I would follow his instructions exactly. \"Can you do that? Answer yes or no.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Before noon, please, Bella. I haven\u0027t got all day,\" he said politely.\n \"Where\u0027s Phil?\" I asked tersely.\n \"Ah, be careful now, Bella. Wait until I ask you to speak, please.\"\n I waited.\n \"It\u0027s important, now, that you don\u0027t make your friends suspicious when you go back to them. Tell them that your mother called, and that you talked her out of coming home for the time being. Now repeat after me, \u0027Thank you, Mom.\u0027 Say it now.\"\n \"Thank you, Mom.\" The tears were coming. I tried to fight them back.\n \"Say, \u0027I love you, Mom, I\u0027ll see you soon.\u0027 Say it now.\"\n \"I love you, Mom.\" My voice was thick. \"I\u0027ll see you soon,\" I promised.\n \"Goodbye, Bella. I look forward to seeing you again.\" He hung up.\n I held the phone to my ear. My joints were frozen with terror - I couldn\u0027t unbend my fingers to drop it.\n I knew I had to think, but my head was filled with the sound of my mother\u0027s panic. Seconds ticked by while I fought for control.\n Slowly, slowly, my thoughts started to break past that brick wall of pain. To plan. For I had no choices now but one: to go to the mirrored room and die. I had no guarantees, nothing to give to keep my mother alive. I could only hope that James would be satisfied with winning the game, that beating Edward would be enough. Despair gripped me; there was no way to bargain, nothing I could offer or withhold that could influence him. But I still had no choice. I had to try.\n I pushed the terror back as well as I could. My decision was made. It did no good to waste time agonizing over the outcome. I had to think clearly, because Alice and Jasper were waiting for me, and evading them was absolutely essential, and absolutely impossible.\n I was suddenly grateful that Jasper was gone. If he had been here to feel my anguish in the last five minutes, how could I have kept them from being suspicious? I choked back the dread, the anxiety, tried to stifle it. I couldn\u0027t afford it now. I didn\u0027t know when he would return.\n I concentrated on my escape. I had to hope that my familiarity with the airport would turn the odds in my favor. Somehow, I had to keep Alice away...\n I knew Alice was in the other room waiting for me, curious. But I had to deal with one more thing in private, before Jasper was back.\n I had to accept that I wouldn\u0027t see Edward again, not even one last glimpse of his face to carry with me to the mirror room. I was going to hurt him, and I couldn\u0027t say goodbye. I let the waves of torture wash over me, have their way for a time. Then I pushed them back, too, and\n went to face Alice.\n The only expression I could manage was a dull, dead look. I saw her alarm and I didn\u0027t wait for her to ask. I had just one script and I\u0027d never manage improvisation now.\n \"My mom was worried, she wanted to come home. But it\u0027s okay, I convinced her to stay away.\" My voice was lifeless.\n \"We\u0027ll make sure she\u0027s fine, Bella, don\u0027t worry.\"\n I turned away; I couldn\u0027t let her see my face.\n My eye fell on a blank page of the hotel stationery on the desk. I went to it slowly, a plan forming. There was an envelope there, too. That was good.\n \"Alice,\" I asked slowly, without turning, keeping my voice level. \"If I write a letter for my mother, would you give it to her? Leave it at the house, I mean.\"\n \"Sure, Bella.\" Her voice was careful. She could see me coming apart at the seams. I had to keep my emotions under better control.\n I went into the bedroom again, and knelt next to the little bedside table to write.\n \"Edward,\" I wrote. My hand was shaking, the letters were hardly legible.\n I love you. I am so sorry. He has my mom, and I have to try. I know it may not work. I am so very, very sorry.\n Don\u0027t be angry with Alice and Jasper. If I get away from them it will be a miracle. Tell them thank you for me. Alice especially, please.\n And please, please, don\u0027t come after him. That\u0027s what he wants. I think. I can\u0027t bear it if anyone has to be hurt because of me, especially you. Please, this is the only thing I can ask you now. For me.\n I love you. Forgive me.\n Bella\n I folded the letter carefully, and sealed it in the envelope. Eventually he would find it. I only hoped he would understand, and listen to me just this once.\n And then I carefully sealed away my heart. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twilight-twilight-1/page-21.html","bookId":2023,"book":{"id":2023,"title":"Twilight (Twilight #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Twilight is a young-adult vampire-romance novel by author Stephenie Meyer.
