I didn\u0027t even realize when I first walked in that class had already started.\\n\\n \"Thank you for joining us, Miss Swan,\" Mr. Mason said in a disparaging tone.\\n\\n I flushed and hurried to my seat.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t till class ended that I realized Mike wasn\u0027t sitting in his usual seat next to me. I felt a twinge of guilt. But he and Eric both met me at the door as usual, so I figured I wasn\u0027t totally unforgiven. Mike seemed to become more himself as we walked, gaining enthusiasm as he talked about the weather report for this weekend. The rain was supposed to take a minor break, and so maybe his beach trip would be possible. I tried to sound eager, to make up for disappointing him yesterday. It was hard; rain or no rain, it would still only be in the high forties, if we were lucky.\\n\\n The rest of the morning passed in a blur. It was difficult to believe that I hadn\u0027t just imagined what Edward had said, and the way his eyes had looked. Maybe it was just a very convincing dream that I\u0027d confused with reality. That seemed more probable than that I really appealed to him on any level.\\n\\n So I was impatient and frightened as Jessica and I entered the cafeteria. I wanted to see his face, to see if he\u0027d gone back to the cold, indifferent person I\u0027d known for the last several weeks. Or if, by some miracle, I\u0027d really heard what I thought I\u0027d heard this morning. Jessica babbled on and on about her dance plans - Lauren and Angela had asked the other boys and they were all going together - completely unaware of my inattention.\\n\\n Disappointment flooded through me as my eyes unerringly focused on his table. The other four were there, but he was absent. Had he gone home? I followed the still-babbling Jessica through the line, crushed. I\u0027d lost my appetite - I bought nothing but a bottle of lemonade. I just wanted to go sit down and sulk.\\n\\n \"Edward Cullen is staring at you again,\" Jessica said, finally breaking through my abstraction with his name. \"I wonder why he\u0027s sitting alone today.\"\\n\\n My head snapped up. I followed her gaze to see Edward, smiling crookedly, staring at me from an empty table across the cafeteria from where he usually sat. Once he\u0027d caught my eye, he raised one hand and motioned with his index finger for me to join him. As I stared in disbelief, he winked.\\n\\n \"Does he mean you?\" Jessica asked with insulting astonishment in her voice.\\n\\n \"Maybe he needs help with his Biology homework,\" I muttered for her benefit. \"Um, I\u0027d better go see what he wants.\"\\n\\n I could feel her staring after me as I walked away.\\n\\n When I reached his table, I stood behind the chair across from him, unsure.\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you sit with me today?\" he asked, smiling.\\n\\n I sat down automatically, watching him with caution. He was still smiling. It was hard to believe that someone so beautiful could be real. I was afraid that he might disappear in a sudden puff of smoke, and I would wake up.\\n\\n He seemed to be waiting for me to say something.\\n\\n \"This is different,\" I finally managed.\\n\\n \"Well...\" He paused, and then the rest of the words followed in a rush. \"I decided as long as I was going to hell, I might as well do it thoroughly.\"\\n\\n I waited for him to say something that made sense. The seconds ticked by.\\n\\n \"You know I don\u0027t have any idea what you mean,\" I eventually pointed out.\\n\\n \"I know.\" He smiled again, and then he changed the subject. \"I think your friends are angry with me for stealing you.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027ll survive.\" I could feel their stares boring into my back.\\n\\n \"I may not give you back, though,\" he said with a wicked glint in his eyes.\\n\\n I gulped.\\n\\n He laughed. \"You look worried.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I said, but, ridiculously, my voice broke. \"Surprised, actually... what brought all this on?\"\\n\\n \"I told you - I got tired of trying to stay away from you. So I\u0027m giving up.\" He was still smiling, but his ocher eyes were serious.\\n\\n \"Giving up?\" I repeated in confusion.\\n\\n \"Yes - giving up trying to be good. I\u0027m just going to do what I want now, and let the chips fall where they may.\" His smile faded as he explained, and a hard edge crept into his voice.\\n\\n \"You lost me again.\"\\n\\n The breathtaking crooked smile reappeared.\\n\\n \"I always say too much when I\u0027m talking to you - that\u0027s one of the problems.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry - I don\u0027t understand any of it,\" I said wryly.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m counting on that.\"\\n\\n \"So, in plain English, are we friends now?\"\\n\\n \"Friends...\" he mused, dubious.\\n\\n \"Or not,\" I muttered.\\n\\n He grinned. \"Well, we can try, I suppose. But I\u0027m warning you now that I\u0027m not a good friend for you.\" Behind his smile, the warning was real.\\n\\n \"You say that a lot,\" I noted, trying to ignore the sudden trembling in my stomach and keep my voice even.\\n\\n \"Yes, because you\u0027re not listening to me. I\u0027m still waiting for you to believe it. If you\u0027re smart, you\u0027ll avoid me.\"\\n\\n \"I think you\u0027ve made your opinion on the subject of my intellect clear, too.\" My eyes narrowed.\\n\\n He smiled apologetically.\\n\\n \"So, as long as I\u0027m being... not smart, we\u0027ll try to be friends?\" I struggled to sum up the confusing exchange.\\n\\n \"That sounds about right.\"\\n\\n I looked down at my hands wrapped around the lemonade bottle, not sure what to do now.\\n\\n \"What are you thinking?\" he asked curiously.\\n\\n I looked up into his deep gold eyes, became befuddled, and, as usual, blurted out the truth.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m trying to figure out what you are.\"\\n\\n His jaw tightened, but he kept his smile in place with some effort.\\n\\n \"Are you having any luck with that?\" he asked in an offhand tone.\\n\\n \"Not too much,\" I admitted.\\n\\n He chuckled. \"What are your theories?\"\\n\\n I blushed. I had been vacillating during the last month between Bruce Wayne and Peter Parker. There was no way I was going to own up to that.\\n\\n \"Won\u0027t you tell me?\" he asked, tilting his head to one side with a shockingly tempting smile.\\n\\n I shook my head. \"Too embarrassing.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s really frustrating, you know,\" he complained.\\n\\n \"No,\" I disagreed quickly, my eyes narrowing, \"I can\u0027t imagine why that would be frustrating at all - just because someone refuses to tell you what they\u0027re thinking, even if all the while they\u0027re making cryptic little remarks specifically designed to keep you up at night wondering what they could possibly mean... now, why would that be frustrating?\"\\n\\n He grimaced.\\n\\n \"Or better,\" I continued, the pent-up annoyance flowing freely now, \"say that person also did a wide range of bizarre things - from saving your life under impossible circumstances one day to treating you like a pariah the next, and he never explained any of that, either, even after he promised. That, also, would be very non-frustrating.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got a bit of a temper, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like double standards.\"\\n\\n We stared at each other, unsmiling.\\n\\n He glanced over my shoulder, and then, unexpectedly, he snickered.\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Your boyfriend seems to think I\u0027m being unpleasant to you - he\u0027s debating whether or not to come break up our fight.\" He snickered again.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know who you\u0027re talking about,\" I said frostily. \"But I\u0027m sure you\u0027re wrong, anyway.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not. I told you, most people are easy to read.\"\\n\\n \"Except me, of course.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Except for you.\" His mood shifted suddenly; his eyes turned brooding. \"I wonder why that is.\"\\n\\n I had to look away from the intensity of his stare. I concentrated on unscrewing the lid of my lemonade. I took a swig, staring at the table\\n\\n without seeing it.\\n\\n \"Aren\u0027t you hungry?\" he asked, distracted.\\n\\n \"No.\" I didn\u0027t feel like mentioning that my stomach was already full - of butterflies. \"You?\" I looked at the empty table in front of him.\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027m not hungry.\" I didn\u0027t understand his expression - it looked like he was enjoying some private joke.\\n\\n \"Can you do me a favor?\" I asked after a second of hesitation.\\n\\n He was suddenly wary. \"That depends on what you want.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not much,\" I assured him.\\n\\n He waited, guarded but curious.\\n\\n \"I just wondered... if you could warn me beforehand the next time you decide to ignore me for my own good. Just so I\u0027m prepared.\" I looked at the lemonade bottle as I spoke, tracing the circle of the opening with my pinkie finger.\\n\\n \"That sounds fair.\" He was pressing his lips together to keep from laughing when I looked up.\\n\\n \"Thanks.\"\\n\\n \"Then can I have one answer in return?\" he demanded.\\n\\n \"One.\"\\n\\n \"Tell me one theory.\"\\n\\n Whoops. \"Not that one.\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t qualify, you just promised one answer,\" he reminded me.\\n\\n \"And you\u0027ve broken promises yourself,\" I reminded him back.\\n\\n \"Just one theory - I won\u0027t laugh.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, you will.\" I was positive about that.\\n\\n He looked down, and then glanced up at me through his long black lashes, his ocher eyes scorching.\\n\\n \"Please?\" he breathed, leaning toward me.\\n\\n I blinked, my mind going blank. Holy crow, how did he do that?\\n\\n \"Er, what?\" I asked, dazed.\\n\\n \"Please tell me just one little theory.\" His eyes still smoldered at me.\\n\\n \"Um, well, bitten by a radioactive spider?\" Was he a hypnotist, too? Or was I just a hopeless pushover?\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not very creative,\" he scoffed.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, that\u0027s all I\u0027ve got,\" I said, miffed.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not even close,\" he teased.\\n\\n \"No spiders?\"\\n\\n \"Nope.\"\\n\\n \"And no radioactivity?\"\\n\\n \"None.\"\\n\\n \"Dang,\" I sighed.\\n\\n \"Kryptonite doesn\u0027t bother me, either,\" he chuckled.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not supposed to laugh, remember?\"\\n\\n He struggled to compose his face.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll figure it out eventually,\" I warned him.\\n\\n \"I wish you wouldn\u0027t try.\" He was serious again.\\n\\n \"Because... ?\"\\n\\n \"What if I\u0027m not a superhero? What if I\u0027m the bad guy?\" He smiled playfully, but his eyes were impenetrable.\\n\\n \"Oh,\" I said, as several things he\u0027d hinted fell suddenly into place. \"I see.\"\\n\\n \"Do you?\" His face was abruptly severe, as if he were afraid that he\u0027d accidentally said too much.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re dangerous?\" I guessed, my pulse quickening as I intuitively realized the truth of my own words. He was dangerous. He\u0027d been trying to tell me that all along.\\n\\n He just looked at me, eyes full of some emotion I couldn\u0027t comprehend.\\n\\n \"But not bad,\" I whispered, shaking my head. \"No, I don\u0027t believe that you\u0027re bad.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re wrong.\" His voice was almost inaudible. He looked down, stealing my bottle lid and then spinning it on its side between his fingers. I stared at him, wondering why I didn\u0027t feel afraid. He meant what he was saying - that was obvious. But I just felt anxious, on edge... and, more than anything else, fascinated. The same way I always felt when I was near him.\\n\\n The silence lasted until I noticed that the cafeteria was almost empty.\\n\\n I jumped to my feet. \"We\u0027re going to be late.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not going to class today,\" he said, twirling the lid so fast it was just a blur.\\n\\n \"Why not?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s healthy to ditch class now and then.\" He smiled up at me, but his eyes were still troubled.\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027m going,\" I told him. I was far too big a coward to risk getting caught.\\n\\n He turned his attention back to his makeshift top. \"I\u0027ll see you later, then.\"\\n\\n I hesitated, torn, but then the first bell sent me hurrying out the door - with a last glance confirming that he hadn\u0027t moved a centimeter.\\n\\n As I half-ran to class, my head was spinning faster than the bottle cap. So few questions had been answered in comparison to how many new questions had been raised. At least the rain had stopped.\\n\\n I was lucky; Mr. Banner wasn\u0027t in the room yet when I arrived. I settled quickly into my seat, aware that both Mike and Angela were staring at me. Mike looked resentful; Angela looked surprised, and slightly awed.\\n\\n Mr. Banner came in the room then, calling the class to order. He was juggling a few small cardboard boxes in his arms. He put them down on Mike\u0027s table, telling him to start passing them around the class.\\n\\n \"Okay, guys, I want you all to take one piece from each box,\" he said as he produced a pair of rubber gloves from the pocket of his lab jacket and pulled them on. The sharp sound as the gloves snapped into place against his wrists seemed ominous to me. \"The first should be an indicator card,\" he went on, grabbing a white card with four squares marked on it and displaying it. \"The second is a four-pronged applicator -\" he held up something that looked like a nearly toothless hair pick \"- and the third is a sterile micro-lancet.\" He held up a small piece of blue plastic and split it open. The barb was invisible from this distance, but my stomach flipped.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be coming around with a dropper of water to prepare your cards, so please don\u0027t start until I get to you.\" He began at Mike\u0027s table again, carefully putting one drop of water in each of the four squares. \"Then I want you to carefully prick your finger with the lancet...\" He grabbed Mike\u0027s hand and jabbed the spike into the tip of Mike\u0027s middle finger. Oh no. Clammy moisture broke out across my forehead.\\n\\n \"Put a small drop of blood on each of the prongs.\" He demonstrated, squeezing Mike\u0027s finger till the blood flowed. I swallowed convulsively, my stomach heaving.\\n\\n \"And then apply it to the card,\" he finished, holding up the dripping red card for us to see. I closed my eyes, trying to hear through the ringing in my ears.\\n\\n \"The Red Cross is having a blood drive in Port Angeles next weekend, so I thought you should all know your blood type.\" He sounded proud of himself. \"Those of you who aren\u0027t eighteen yet will need a parent\u0027s permission - I have slips at my desk.\"\\n\\n He continued through the room with his water drops. I put my cheek against the cool black tabletop and tried to hold on to my consciousness. All around me I could hear squeals, complaints, and giggles as my classmates skewered their fingers. I breathed slowly in and out through my mouth.\\n\\n \"Bella, are you all right?\" Mr. Banner asked. His voice was close to my head, and it sounded alarmed.\\n\\n \"I already know my blood type, Mr. Banner,\" I said in a weak voice. I was afraid to raise my head.\\n\\n \"Are you feeling faint?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir,\" I muttered, internally kicking myself for not ditching when I had the chance.\\n\\n \"Can someone take Bella to the nurse, please?\" he called.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t have to look up to know that it would be Mike who volunteered.\\n\\n \"Can you walk?\" Mr. Banner asked.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I whispered. Just let me get out of here, I thought. I\u0027ll crawl.\\n\\n Mike seemed eager as he put his arm around my waist and pulled my arm over his shoulder. I leaned against him heavily on the way out of the classroom.\\n\\n Mike towed me slowly across campus. When we were around the edge of the cafeteria, out of sight of building four in case Mr. Banner was watching, I stopped.\\n\\n \"Just let me sit for a minute, please?\" I begged.\\n\\n He helped me sit on the edge of the walk.\\n\\n \"And whatever you do, keep your hand in your pocket,\" I warned. I was still so dizzy. I slumped over on my side, putting my cheek against the freezing, damp cement of the sidewalk, closing my eyes. That seemed to help a little.\\n\\n \"Wow, you\u0027re green, Bella,\" Mike said nervously.\\n\\n \"Bella?\" a different voice called from the distance.\\n\\n No! Please let me be imagining that horribly familiar voice.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong - is she hurt?\" His voice was closer now, and he sounded upset. I wasn\u0027t imagining it. I squeezed my eyes shut, hoping to die. Or, at the very least, not to throw up.\\n\\n Mike seemed stressed. \"I think she\u0027s fainted. I don\u0027t know what happened, she didn\u0027t even stick her finger.\"\\n\\n \"Bella.\" Edward\u0027s voice was right beside me, relieved now. \"Can you hear me?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I groaned. \"Go away.\"\\n\\n He chuckled.\\n\\n \"I was taking her to the nurse,\" Mike explained in a defensive tone, \"but she wouldn\u0027t go any farther.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll take her,\" Edward said. I could hear the smile still in his voice. \"You can go back to class.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Mike protested. \"I\u0027m supposed to do it.\"\\n\\n Suddenly the sidewalk disappeared from beneath me. My eyes flew open in shock. Edward had scooped me up in his arms, as easily as if I weighed ten pounds instead of a hundred and ten.\\n\\n \"Put me down!\" Please, please let me not vomit on him. He was walking before I was finished talking.\\n\\n \"Hey!\" Mike called, already ten paces behind us.\\n\\n Edward ignored him. \"You look awful,\" he told me, grinning.\\n\\n \"Put me back on the sidewalk,\" I moaned. The rocking movement of his walk was not helping. He held me away from his body, gingerly, supporting all my weight with just his arms - it didn\u0027t seem to bother him.\\n\\n \"So you faint at the sight of blood?\" he asked. This seemed to entertain him.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t answer. I closed my eyes again and fought the nausea with all my strength, clamping my lips together.\\n\\n \"And not even your own blood,\" he continued, enjoying himself.\\n\\n I don\u0027t know how he opened the door while carrying me, but it was suddenly warm, so I knew we were inside.\\n\\n \"Oh my,\" I heard a female voice gasp.\\n\\n \"She fainted in Biology,\" Edward explained.\\n\\n I opened my eyes. I was in the office, and Edward was striding past the front counter toward the nurse\u0027s door. Ms. Cope, the redheaded front office receptionist, ran ahead of him to hold it open. The grandmotherly nurse looked up from a novel, astonished, as Edward swung me into the room and placed me gently on the crackly paper that covered the brown vinyl mattress on the one cot. Then he moved to stand against the wall as far across the narrow room as possible. His eyes were bright, excited.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s just a little faint,\" he reassured the startled nurse. \"They\u0027re blood typing in Biology.\"\\n\\n The nurse nodded sagely. \"There\u0027s always one.\"\\n\\n He muffled a snicker.\\n\\n \"Just lie down for a minute, honey; it\u0027ll pass.\"\\n\\n \"I know,\" I sighed. The nausea was already fading.\\n\\n \"Does this happen a lot?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"Sometimes,\" I admitted. Edward coughed to hide another laugh.\\n\\n \"You can go back to class now,\" she told him.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m supposed to stay with her.\" He said this with such assured authority that - even though she pursed her lips - the nurse didn\u0027t argue it further.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll go get you some ice for your forehead, dear,\" she said to me, and then bustled out of the room.\\n\\n \"You were right,\" I moaned, letting my eyes close.\\n\\n \"I usually am - but about what in particular this time?\"\\n\\n \"Ditching is healthy.\" I practiced breathing evenly.\\n\\n \"You scared me for a minute there,\" he admitted after a pause. His tone made it sound like he was confessing a humiliating weakness. \"I thought Newton was dragging your dead body off to bury it in the woods.\"\\n\\n \"Ha ha.\" I still had my eyes closed, but I was feeling more normal every minute.\\n\\n \"Honestly - I\u0027ve seen corpses with better color. I was concerned that I might have to avenge your murder.\"\\n\\n \"Poor Mike. I\u0027ll bet he\u0027s mad.\"\\n\\n \"He absolutely loathes me,\" Edward said cheerfully.\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t know that,\" I argued, but then I wondered suddenly if he could.\\n\\n \"I saw his face - I could tell.\"\\n\\n \"How did you see me? I thought you were ditching.\" I was almost fine now, though the queasiness would probably pass faster if I\u0027d eaten something for lunch. On the other hand, maybe it was lucky my stomach was empty.\\n\\n \"I was in my car, listening to a CD.\" Such a normal response - it surprised me.\\n\\n I heard the door and opened my eyes to see the nurse with a cold compress in her hand.\\n\\n \"Here you go, dear.\" She laid it across my forehead. \"You\u0027re looking better,\" she added.\\n\\n \"I think I\u0027m fine,\" I said, sitting up. Just a little ringing in my ears, no spinning. The mint green walls stayed where they should.\\n\\n I could see she was about to make me lie back down, but the door opened just then, and Ms. Cope stuck her head in.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve got another one,\" she warned.\\n\\n I hopped down to free up the cot for the next invalid.\\n\\n I handed the compress back to the nurse. \"Here, I don\u0027t need this.\"\\n\\n And then Mike staggered through the door, now supporting a sallow-looking Lee Stephens, another boy in our Biology class. Edward and I drew back against the wall to give them room.\\n\\n \"Oh no,\" Edward muttered. \"Go out to the office, Bella.\"\\n\\n I looked up at him, bewildered.\\n\\n \"Trust me - go.\"\\n\\n I spun and caught the door before it closed, darting out of the infirmary. I could feel Edward right behind me.\\n\\n \"You actually listened to me.\" He was stunned.\\n\\n \"I smelled the blood,\" I said, wrinkling my nose. Lee wasn\u0027t sick from watching other people, like me.\\n\\n \"People can\u0027t smell blood,\" he contradicted.\\n\\n \"Well, I can - that\u0027s what makes me sick. It smells like rust... and salt.\"\\n\\n He was staring at me with an unfathomable expression.\\n\\n \"What?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s nothing.\"\\n\\n Mike came through the door then, glancing from me to Edward. The look he gave Edward confirmed what Edward had said about loathing. He looked back at me, his eyes glum.\\n\\n \"You look better,\" he accused.\\n\\n \"Just keep your hand in your pocket,\" I warned him again.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not bleeding anymore,\" he muttered. \"Are you going back to class?\"\\n\\n \"Are you kidding? I\u0027d just have to turn around and come back.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I guess... So are you going this weekend? To the beach?\" While he spoke, he flashed another glare toward Edward, who was standing against the cluttered counter, motionless as a sculpture, staring off into space.\\n\\n I tried to sound as friendly as possible. \"Sure, I said I was in.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re meeting at my dad\u0027s store, at ten.\" His eyes flickered to Edward again, wondering if he was giving out too much information. His body language made it clear that it wasn\u0027t an open invitation.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be there,\" I promised.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll see you in Gym, then,\" he said, moving uncertainly toward the door.\\n\\n \"See you,\" I replied. He looked at me once more, his round face slightly pouting, and then as he walked slowly through the door, his shoulders slumped. A swell of sympathy washed over me. I pondered seeing his disappointed face again... in Gym.\\n\\n \"Gym,\" I groaned.\\n\\n \"I can take care of that.\" I hadn\u0027t noticed Edward moving to my side, but he spoke now in my ear. \"Go sit down and look pale,\" he muttered.\\n\\n That wasn\u0027t a challenge; I was always pale, and my recent swoon had left a light sheen of sweat on my face. I sat in one of the creaky folding chairs and rested my head against the wall with my eyes closed. Fainting spells always exhausted me.\\n\\n I heard Edward speaking softly at the counter.\\n\\n \"Ms. Cope?\"\\n\\n \"Yes?\" I hadn\u0027t heard her return to her desk.\\n\\n \"Bella has Gym next hour, and I don\u0027t think she feels well enough.\\n\\n Actually, I was thinking I should take her home now. Do you think you could excuse her from class?\" His voice was like melting honey. I could imagine how much more overwhelming his eyes would be.\\n\\n \"Do you need to be excused, too, Edward?\" Ms. Cope fluttered. Why couldn\u0027t I do that?\\n\\n \"No, I have Mrs. Goff, she won\u0027t mind.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, it\u0027s all taken care of. You feel better, Bella,\" she called to me. I nodded weakly, hamming it up just a bit.\\n\\n \"Can you walk, or do you want me to carry you again?\" With his back to the receptionist, his expression became sarcastic.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll walk.\"\\n\\n I stood carefully, and I was still fine. He held the door for me, his smile polite but his eyes mocking. I walked out into the cold, fine mist that had just begun to fall. It felt nice - the first time I\u0027d enjoyed the constant moisture falling out of the sky - as it washed my face clean of the sticky perspiration.\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" I said as he followed me out. \"It\u0027s almost worth getting sick to miss Gym.\"\\n\\n \"Anytime.\" He was staring straight forward, squinting into the rain.\\n\\n \"So are you going? This Saturday, I mean?\" I was hoping he would, though it seemed unlikely. I couldn\u0027t picture him loading up to carpool with the rest of the kids from school; he didn\u0027t belong in the same world. But just hoping that he might gave me the first twinge of enthusiasm I\u0027d felt for the outing.\\n\\n \"Where are you all going, exactly?\" He was still looking ahead, expressionless.\\n\\n \"Down to La Push, to First Beach.\" I studied his face, trying to read it. His eyes seemed to narrow infinitesimally.\\n\\n He glanced down at me from the corner of his eye, smiling wryly. \"I really don\u0027t think I was invited.\"\\n\\n I sighed. \"I just invited you.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s you and I not push poor Mike any further this week. We don\u0027t want him to snap.\" His eyes danced; he was enjoying the idea more than he should.\\n\\n \"Mike-schmike.\" I muttered, preoccupied by the way he\u0027d said \"you and I.\" I liked it more than I should.\\n\\n We were near the parking lot now. I veered left, toward my truck. Something caught my jacket, yanking me back.\\n\\n \"Where do you think you\u0027re going?\" he asked, outraged. He was gripping a fistful of my jacket in one hand.\\n\\n I was confused. \"I\u0027m going home.\"\\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t you hear me promise to take you safely home? Do you think I\u0027m going to let you drive in your condition?\" His voice was still indignant.\\n\\n \"What condition? And what about my truck?\" I complained.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll have Alice drop it off after school.\" He was towing me toward his car now, pulling me by my jacket. It was all I could do to keep from falling backward. He\u0027d probably just drag me along anyway if I did.\\n\\n \"Let go!\" I insisted. He ignored me. I staggered along sideways across the wet sidewalk until we reached the Volvo. Then he finally freed me - I stumbled against the passenger door.\\n\\n \"You are so pushy!\" I grumbled.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s open,\" was all he responded. He got in the driver\u0027s side.\\n\\n \"I am perfectly capable of driving myself home!\" I stood by the car, fuming. It was raining harder now, and I\u0027d never put my hood up, so my hair was dripping down my back.\\n\\n He lowered the automatic window and leaned toward me across the seat. \"Get in, Bella.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t answer. I was mentally calculating my chances of reaching the truck before he could catch me. I had to admit, they weren\u0027t good.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll just drag you back,\" he threatened, guessing my plan.\\n\\n I tried to maintain what dignity I could as I got into his car. I wasn\u0027t very successful - I looked like a half-drowned cat and my boots squeaked.\\n\\n \"This is completely unnecessary,\" I said stiffly.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t answer. He fiddled with the controls, turning the heater up and the music down. As he pulled out of the parking lot, I was preparing to give him the silent treatment - my face in full pout mode - but then I recognized the music playing, and my curiosity got the better of my intentions.\\n\\n \"Clair de Lune?\" I asked, surprised.\\n\\n \"You know Debussy?\" He sounded surprised, too.\\n\\n \"Not well,\" I admitted. \"My mother plays a lot of classical music around the house - I only know my favorites.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s one of my favorites, too.\" He stared out through the rain, lost in thought.\\n\\n I listened to the music, relaxing against the light gray leather seat. It was impossible not to respond to the familiar, soothing melody. The rain blurred everything outside the window into gray and green smudges. I began to realize we were driving very fast; the car moved so steadily, so evenly, though, I didn\u0027t feel the speed. Only the town flashing by gave it away.\\n\\n \"What is your mother like?\" he asked me suddenly.\\n\\n I glanced over to see him studying me with curious eyes.\\n\\n \"She looks a lot like me, but she\u0027s prettier,\" I said. He raised his eyebrows. \"I have too much Charlie in me. She\u0027s more outgoing than I am, and braver. She\u0027s irresponsible and slightly eccentric, and she\u0027s a very unpredictable cook. She\u0027s my best friend.\" I stopped. Talking about her was making me depressed.\\n\\n \"How old are you, Bella?\" His voice sounded frustrated for some reason I couldn\u0027t imagine. He\u0027d stopped the car, and I realized we were at Charlie\u0027s house already. The rain was so heavy that I could barely see the house at all. It was like the car was submerged under a river.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m seventeen,\" I responded, a little confused.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t seem seventeen.\"\\n\\n His tone was reproachful; it made me laugh.\\n\\n \"What?\" he asked, curious again.\\n\\n \"My mom always says I was born thirty-five years old and that I get more middle-aged every year.\" I laughed, and then sighed. \"Well, someone has to be the adult.\" I paused for a second. \"You don\u0027t seem much like a junior in high school yourself,\" I noted.\\n\\n He made a face and changed the subject.\\n\\n \"So why did your mother marry Phil?\"\\n\\n I was surprised he would remember the name; I\u0027d mentioned it just once, almost two months ago. It took me a moment to answer.\\n\\n \"My mother... she\u0027s very young for her age. I think Phil makes her feel even younger. At any rate, she\u0027s crazy about him.\" I shook my head. The attraction was a mystery to me.\\n\\n \"Do you approve?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Does it matter?\" I countered. \"I want her to be happy... and he is who she wants.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s very generous... I wonder,\" he mused.\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Would she extend the same courtesy to you, do you think? No matter who your choice was?\" He was suddenly intent, his eyes searching mine.\\n\\n \"I-I think so,\" I stuttered. \"But she\u0027s the parent, after all. It\u0027s a little bit different.\"\\n\\n \"No one too scary then,\" he teased.\\n\\n I grinned in response. \"What do you mean by scary? Multiple facial piercings and extensive tattoos?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s one definition, I suppose.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s your definition?\"\\n\\n But he ignored my question and asked me another. \"Do you think that I could be scary?\" He raised one eyebrow, and the faint trace of a smile lightened his face.\\n\\n I thought for a moment, wondering whether the truth or a lie would go over better. I decided to go with the truth. \"Hmmm... I think you could be, if you wanted to.\"\\n\\n \"Are you frightened of me now?\" The smile vanished, and his heavenly face was suddenly serious.\\n\\n \"No.\" But I answered too quickly. The smile returned.\\n\\n \"So, now are you going to tell me about your family?\" I asked to distract him. \"It\u0027s got to be a much more interesting story than mine.\"\\n\\n He was instantly cautious. \"What do you want to know?\"\\n\\n \"The Cullens adopted you?\" I verified.\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n I hesitated for a moment. \"What happened to your parents?\"\\n\\n \"They died many years ago.\" His tone was matter-of-fact.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I mumbled.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t really remember them that clearly. Carlisle and Esme have been my parents for a long time now.\"\\n\\n \"And you love them.\" It wasn\u0027t a question. It was obvious in the way he spoke of them.\\n\\n \"Yes.\" He smiled. \"I couldn\u0027t imagine two better people.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re very lucky.\"\\n\\n \"I know I am.\"\\n\\n \"And your brother and sister?\"\\n\\n He glanced at the clock on the dashboard.\\n\\n \"My brother and sister, and Jasper and Rosalie for that matter, are going to be quite upset if they have to stand in the rain waiting for me.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, sorry, I guess you have to go.\" I didn\u0027t want to get out of the car.\\n\\n \"And you probably want your truck back before Chief Swan gets home, so you don\u0027t have to tell him about the Biology incident.\" He grinned at me.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure he\u0027s already heard. There are no secrets in Forks.\" I sighed.\\n\\n He laughed, and there was an edge to his laughter.\\n\\n \"Have fun at the beach... good weather for sunbathing.\" He glanced out at the sheeting rain.\\n\\n \"Won\u0027t I see you tomorrow?\"\\n\\n \"No. Emmett and I are starting the weekend early.\"\\n\\n \"What are you going to do?\" A friend could ask that, right? I hoped the disappointment wasn\u0027t too apparent in my voice.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re going to be hiking in the Goat Rocks Wilderness, just south of Rainier.\"\\n\\n I remembered Charlie had said the Cullens went camping frequently.\\n\\n \"Oh, well, have fun.\" I tried to sound enthusiastic. I don\u0027t think I fooled him, though. A smile was playing around the edges of his lips.\\n\\n \"Will you do something for me this weekend?\" He turned to look me straight in the face, utilizing the full power of his burning gold eyes.\\n\\n I nodded helplessly.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be offended, but you seem to be one of those people who just attract accidents like a magnet. So... try not to fall into the ocean or get run over or anything, all right?\" He smiled crookedly.\\n\\n The helplessness had faded as he spoke. I glared at him.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll see what I can do,\" I snapped as I jumped out into the rain. I slammed the door behind me with excessive force.\\n\\n He was still smiling as he drove away. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twilight-twilight-1/page-5.html","bookId":2023,"book":{"id":2023,"title":"Twilight (Twilight #1)","description":"Storyline: Twilight is a young-adult vampire-romance novel by author Stephenie Meyer.
