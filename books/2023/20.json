{"id":107655,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"20. IMPATIENCE When I woke up I was confused. My thoughts were hazy, still twisted up in dreams and nightmares; it took me longer than it should have to realize where I was. This room was too bland to belong anywhere but in a hotel. The bedside lamps, bolted to the tables, were a dead giveaway, as were the long drapes made from the same fabric as the bedspread, and the generic watercolor prints on the walls. I tried to remember how I got here, but nothing came at first. I did remember the sleek black car, the glass in the windows darker than that on a limousine. The engine was almost silent, though we\u0027d raced across the black freeways at more than twice the legal speed. And I remembered Alice sitting with me on the dark leather backseat. Somehow, during the long night, my head had ended up against her granite neck. My closeness didn\u0027t seem to bother her at all, and her cool, hard skin was oddly comforting to me. The front of her thin cotton shirt was cold, damp with the tears that streamed from my eyes until, red and sore, they ran dry. Sleep had evaded me; my aching eyes strained open even though the night finally ended and dawn broke over a low peak somewhere in California. The gray light, streaking across the cloudless sky, stung my eyes. But I couldn\u0027t close them; when I did, the images that flashed all too vividly, like still slides behind my lids, were unbearable. Charlie\u0027s broken expression - Edward\u0027s brutal snarl, teeth bared - Rosalie\u0027s resentful glare - the keen-eyed scrutiny of the tracker - the dead look in Edward\u0027s eyes after he kissed me the last time... I couldn\u0027t stand to see them. So I fought against my weariness and the sun rose higher. I was still awake when we came through a shallow mountain pass and the sun, behind us now, reflected off the tiled rooftops of the Valley of the Sun. I didn\u0027t have enough emotion left to be surprised that we\u0027d made a three-day journey in one. I stared blankly at the wide, flat expanse laid out in front of me. Phoenix - the palm trees, the scrubby creosote, the haphazard lines of the intersecting freeways, the green swaths of golf courses and turquoise splotches of swimming pools, all submerged in a thin smog and embraced by the short, rocky ridges that weren\u0027t really big enough to be called mountains. The shadows of the palm trees slanted across the freeway - defined, sharper than I remembered, paler than they should be. Nothing could hide in these shadows. The bright, open freeway seemed benign enough. But I felt no relief, no sense of homecoming. \"Which way to the airport, Bella?\" Jasper had asked, and I flinched, though his voice was quite soft and un-alarming. It was the first sound, besides the purr of the car, to break the long night\u0027s silence. \"Stay on the I-ten,\" I\u0027d answered automatically. \"We\u0027ll pass right by it.\" My brain had worked slowly through the fog of sleep deprivation. \"Are we flying somewhere?\" I\u0027d asked Alice. \"No, but it\u0027s better to be close, just in case.\" I remembered beginning the loop around Sky Harbor International... but not ending it. I suppose that must have been when I\u0027d fallen asleep. Though, now that I\u0027d chased the memories down, I did have a vague impression of leaving the car - the sun was just falling behind the horizon - my arm draped over Alice\u0027s shoulder and her arm firm around my waist, dragging me along as I stumbled through the warm, dry shadows. I had no memory of this room. I looked at the digital clock on the nightstand. The red numbers claimed it was three o\u0027clock, but they gave no indication if it was night or day. No edge of light escaped the thick curtains, but the room was bright with the light from the lamps. I rose stiffly and staggered to the window, pulling back the drapes. It was dark outside. Three in the morning, then. My room looked out on a deserted section of the freeway and the new long-term parking garage for the airport. It was slightly comforting to be able to pinpoint time and place. I looked down at myself. I was still wearing Esme\u0027s clothes, and they didn\u0027t fit very well at all. I looked around the room, glad when I discovered my duffel bag on top of the low dresser. I was on my way to find new clothes when a light tap on the door made me jump. \"Can I come in?\" Alice asked. I took a deep breath. \"Sure.\" She walked in, and looked me over cautiously. \"You look like you could sleep longer,\" she said. I just shook my head. She drifted silently to the curtains and closed them securely before turning back to me. \"We\u0027ll need to stay inside,\" she told me. \"Okay.\" My voice was hoarse; it cracked. \"Thirsty?\" she asked. I shrugged. \"I\u0027m okay. How about you?\" \"Nothing unmanageable.\" She smiled. \"I ordered some food for you, it\u0027s in the front room. Edward reminded me that you have to eat a lot more frequently than we do.\" I was instantly more alert. \"He called?\" \"No,\" she said, and watched as my face fell. \"It was before we left.\" She took my hand carefully and led me through the door into the living room of the hotel suite. I could hear a low buzz of voices coming from the TV. Jasper sat motionlessly at the desk in the corner, his eyes watching the news with no glimmer of interest. I sat on the floor next to the coffee table, where a tray of food waited, and began picking at it without noticing what I was eating. Alice perched on the arm of the sofa and stared blankly at the TV like Jasper. I ate slowly, watching her, turning now and then to glance quickly at Jasper. It began to dawn on me that they were too still. They never looked away from the screen, though commercials were playing now. I pushed the tray away, my stomach abruptly uneasy. Alice looked down at me. \"What\u0027s wrong, Alice?\" I asked. \"Nothing\u0027s wrong.\" Her eyes were wide, honest... and I didn\u0027t trust them. \"What do we do now?\" \"We wait for Carlisle to call.\" \"And should he have called by now?\" I could see that I was near the mark. Alice\u0027s eyes flitted from mine to the phone on top of her leather bag and back. \"What does that mean?\" My voice quavered, and I fought to control it. \"That he hasn\u0027t called yet?\" \"It just means that they don\u0027t have anything to tell us.\" But her voice was too even, and the air was harder to breathe. Jasper was suddenly beside Alice, closer to me than usual. \"Bella,\" he said in a suspiciously soothing voice. \"You have nothing to worry about. You are completely safe here.\" \"I know that.\" \"Then why are you frightened?\" he asked, confused. He might feel the tenor of my emotions, but he couldn\u0027t read the reasons behind them. \"You heard what Laurent said.\" My voice was just a whisper, but I was sure they could hear me. \"He said James was lethal. What if something goes wrong, and they get separated? If something happens to any of them, Carlisle, Emmett... Edward...\" I gulped. \"If that wild female hurts Esme...\" My voice had grown higher, a note of hysteria beginning to rise in it. \"How could I live with myself when it\u0027s my fault? None of you should be risking yourselves for me -\" \"Bella, Bella, stop,\" he interrupted me, his words pouring out so quickly they were hard to understand. \"You\u0027re worrying about all the wrong things, Bella. Trust me on this - none of us are in jeopardy. You are under too much strain as it is; don\u0027t add to it with wholly unnecessary worries. Listen to me!\" he ordered, for I had looked away. \"Our family is strong. Our only fear is losing you.\" \"But why should you -\" Alice interrupted this time, touching my cheek with her cold fingers. \"It\u0027s been almost a century that Edward\u0027s been alone. Now he\u0027s found you. You can\u0027t see the changes that we see, we who have been with him for so long. Do you think any of us want to look into his eyes for the next hundred years if he loses you?\" My guilt slowly subsided as I looked into her dark eyes. But, even as the calm spread over me, I knew I couldn\u0027t trust my feelings with Jasper there. It was a very long day. We stayed in the room. Alice called down to the front desk and asked them to ignore our maid service for now. The windows stayed shut, the TV on, though no one watched it. At regular intervals, food was delivered for me. The silver phone resting on Alice\u0027s bag seemed to grow bigger as the hours passed. My babysitters handled the suspense better than I did. As I fidgeted and paced, they simply grew more still, two statues whose eyes followed me imperceptibly as I moved. I occupied myself with memorizing the room; the striped pattern of the couches, tan, peach, cream, dull gold, and tan again. Sometimes I stared at the abstract prints, randomly finding pictures in the shapes, like I\u0027d found pictures in the clouds as a child. I traced a blue hand, a woman combing her hair, a cat stretching. But when the pale red circle became a staring eye, I looked away. As the afternoon wore on, I went back to bed, simply for something to do. I hoped that by myself in the dark, I could give in to the terrible fears that hovered on the edge of my consciousness, unable to break through under Jasper\u0027s careful supervision. But Alice followed me casually, as if by some coincidence she had grown tired of the front room at the same time. I was beginning to wonder exactly what sort of instructions Edward had given her. I lay across the bed, and she sat, legs folded, next to me. I ignored her at first, suddenly tired enough to sleep. But after a few minutes, the panic that had held off in Jasper\u0027s presence began to make itself known. I gave up on the idea of sleep quickly then, curling up into a small ball, wrapping my arms around my legs. \"Alice?\" I asked. \"Yes?\" I kept my voice very calm. \"What do you think they\u0027re doing?\" \"Carlisle wanted to lead the tracker as far north as possible, wait for him to get close, and then turn and ambush him. Esme and Rosalie were supposed to head west as long as they could keep the female behind them. If she turned around, they were to head back to Forks and keep an eye on your dad. So I imagine things are going well if they can\u0027t call. It means the tracker is close enough that they don\u0027t want him to overhear.\" \"And Esme?\" \"I think she must be back in Forks. She won\u0027t call if there\u0027s any chance the female will overhear. I expect they\u0027re all just being very careful.\" \"Do you think they\u0027re safe, really?\" \"Bella, how many times do we have to tell you that there\u0027s no danger to us?\" \"Would you tell me the truth, though?\" \"Yes. I will always tell you the truth.\" Her voice was earnest. I deliberated for a moment, and decided she meant it. \"Tell me then... how do you become a vampire?\" My question caught her off guard. She was quiet. I rolled over to look at her, and her expression seemed ambivalent. \"Edward doesn\u0027t want me to tell you that,\" she said firmly, but I sensed she didn\u0027t agree. \"That\u0027s not fair. I think I have a right to know.\" \"I know.\" I looked at her, waiting. She sighed. \"He\u0027ll be extremely angry.\" \"It\u0027s none of his business. This is between you and me. Alice, as a friend, I\u0027m begging you.\" And we were friends now, somehow - as she must have known we would be all along. She looked at me with her splendid, wise eyes... choosing. \"I\u0027ll tell you the mechanics of it,\" she said finally, \"but I don\u0027t remember it myself, and I\u0027ve never done it or seen it done, so keep in mind that I can only tell you the theory.\" I waited. \"As predators, we have a glut of weapons in our physical arsenal - much, much more than really necessary. The strength, the speed, the acute senses, not to mention those of us like Edward, Jasper, and I, who have extra senses as well. And then, like a carnivorous flower, we are physically attractive to our prey.\" I was very still, remembering how pointedly Edward had demonstrated the same concept for me in the meadow. She smiled a wide, ominous smile. \"We have another fairly superfluous weapon. We\u0027re also venomous,\" she said, her teeth glistening. \"The venom doesn\u0027t kill - it\u0027s merely incapacitating. It works slowly, spreading through the bloodstream, so that, once bitten, our prey is in too much physical pain to escape us. Mostly superfluous, as I said. If we\u0027re that close, the prey doesn\u0027t escape. Of course, there are always exceptions. Carlisle, for example.\" \"So... if the venom is left to spread...\" I murmured. \"It takes a few days for the transformation to be complete, depending on how much venom is in the bloodstream, how close the venom enters to the heart. As long as the heart keeps beating, the poison spreads, healing, changing the body as it moves through it. Eventually the heart stops, and the conversion is finished. But all that time, every minute of it, a victim would be wishing for death.\" I shivered. \"It\u0027s not pleasant, you see.\" \"Edward said that it was very hard to do... I don\u0027t quite understand,\" I said. \"We\u0027re also like sharks in a way. Once we taste the blood, or even smell it for that matter, it becomes very hard to keep from feeding. Sometimes impossible. So you see, to actually bite someone, to taste the blood, it would begin the frenzy. It\u0027s difficult on both sides - the blood-lust on the one hand, the awful pain on the other.\" \"Why do you think you don\u0027t remember?\" \"I don\u0027t know. For everyone else, the pain of transformation is the sharpest memory they have of their human life. I remember nothing of being human.\" Her voice was wistful. We lay silently, wrapped in our individual meditations. The seconds ticked by, and I had almost forgotten her presence, I was so enveloped in my thoughts. Then, without any warning, Alice leaped from the bed, landing lightly on her feet. My head jerked up as I stared at her, startled. \"Something\u0027s changed.\" Her voice was urgent, and she wasn\u0027t talking to me anymore. She reached the door at the same time Jasper did. He had obviously heard our conversation and her sudden exclamation. He put his hands on her shoulders and guided her back to the bed, sitting her on the edge. \"What do you see?\" he asked intently, staring into her eyes. Her eyes were focused on something very far away. I sat close to her, leaning in to catch her low, quick voice. \"I see a room. It\u0027s long, and there are mirrors everywhere. The floor is wooden. He\u0027s in the room, and he\u0027s waiting. There\u0027s gold... a gold stripe across the mirrors.\" \"Where is the room?\" \"I don\u0027t know. Something is missing - another decision hasn\u0027t been made yet.\" \"How much time?\" \"It\u0027s soon. He\u0027ll be in the mirror room today, or maybe tomorrow. It all depends. He\u0027s waiting for something. And he\u0027s in the dark now.\" Jasper\u0027s voice was calm, methodical, as he questioned her in a practiced way. \"What is he doing?\" \"He\u0027s watching TV... no, he\u0027s running a VCR, in the dark, in another place.\" \"Can you see where he is?\" \"No, it\u0027s too dark.\" \"And the mirror room, what else is there?\" \"Just the mirrors, and the gold. It\u0027s a band, around the room. And there\u0027s a black table with a big stereo, and a TV. He\u0027s touching the VCR there, but he doesn\u0027t watch the way he does in the dark room. This is the room where he waits.\" Her eyes drifted, then focused on Jasper\u0027s face. \"There\u0027s nothing else?\" She shook her head. They looked at each other, motionless. \"What does it mean?\" I asked. Neither of them answered for a moment, then Jasper looked at me. \"It means the tracker\u0027s plans have changed. He\u0027s made a decision that will lead him to the mirror room, and the dark room.\" \"But we don\u0027t know where those rooms are?\" \"No.\" \"But we do know that he won\u0027t be in the mountains north of Washington, being hunted. He\u0027ll elude them.\" Alice\u0027s voice was bleak. \"Should we call?\" I asked. They traded a serious look, undecided. And the phone rang. Alice was across the room before I could lift my head to look at it. She pushed a button and held the phone to her ear, but she didn\u0027t speak first. \"Carlisle,\" she breathed. She didn\u0027t seem surprised or relieved, the way I felt. \"Yes,\" she said, glancing at me. She listened for a long moment. \"I just saw him.\" She described again the vision she\u0027d seen. \"Whatever made him get on that plane... it was leading him to those rooms.\" She paused. \"Yes,\" Alice said into the phone, and then she spoke to me. \"Bella?\" She held the phone out toward me. I ran to it. \"Hello?\" I breathed. \"Bella,\" Edward said. \"Oh, Edward! I was so worried.\" \"Bella,\" he sighed in frustration, \"I told you not to worry about anything but yourself.\" It was so unbelievably good to hear his voice. I felt the hovering cloud of despair lighten and drift back as he spoke. \"Where are you?\" \"We\u0027re outside of Vancouver. Bella, I\u0027m sorry - we lost him. He seems suspicious of us - he\u0027s careful to stay just far enough away that I can\u0027t hear what he\u0027s thinking. But he\u0027s gone now - it looks like he got on a plane. We think he\u0027s heading back to Forks to start over.\" I could hear Alice filling in Jasper behind me, her quick words blurring together into a humming noise. \"I know. Alice saw that he got away.\" \"You don\u0027t have to worry, though. He won\u0027t find anything to lead him to you. You just have to stay there and wait till we find him again.\" \"I\u0027ll be fine. Is Esme with Charlie?\" \"Yes - the female has been in town. She went to the house, but while Charlie was at work. She hasn\u0027t gone near him, so don\u0027t be afraid. He\u0027s safe with Esme and Rosalie watching.\" \"What is she doing?\" \"Probably trying to pick up the trail. She\u0027s been all through the town during the night. Rosalie traced her through the airport, all the roads around town, the school... she\u0027s digging, Bella, but there\u0027s nothing to find.\" \"And you\u0027re sure Charlie\u0027s safe?\" \"Yes, Esme won\u0027t let him out of her sight. And we\u0027ll be there soon. If the tracker gets anywhere near Forks, we\u0027ll have him.\" \"I miss you,\" I whispered. \"I know, Bella. Believe me, I know. It\u0027s like you\u0027ve taken half my self away with you.\" \"Come and get it, then,\" I challenged. \"Soon, as soon as I possibly can. I will make you safe first.\" His voice was hard. \"I love you,\" I reminded him. \"Could you believe that, despite everything I\u0027ve put you through, I love you, too?\" \"Yes, I can, actually.\" \"I\u0027ll come for you soon.\" \"I\u0027ll be waiting.\" As soon as the phone went dead, the cloud of depression began to creep over me again. I turned to give the phone back to Alice and found her and Jasper bent over the table, where Alice was sketching on a piece of hotel stationery. I leaned on the back of the couch, looking over her shoulder. She drew a room: long, rectangular, with a thinner, square section at the back. The wooden planks that made up the floor stretched lengthwise across the room. Down the walls were lines denoting the breaks in the mirrors. And then, wrapping around the walls, waist high, a long band. The band Alice said was gold. \"It\u0027s a ballet studio,\" I said, suddenly recognizing the familiar shapes. They looked at me, surprised. \"Do you know this room?\" Jasper\u0027s voice sounded calm, but there was an undercurrent of something I couldn\u0027t identify. Alice bent her head to her work, her hand flying across the page now, the shape of an emergency exit taking shape against the back wall, the stereo and TV on a low table by the front right corner. \"It looks like a place I used to go for dance lessons - when I was eight or nine. It was shaped just the same.\" I touched the page where the square section jutted out, narrowing the back part of the room. \"That\u0027s where the bathrooms were - the doors were through the other dance floor. But the stereo was here\" - I pointed to the left corner - \"it was older, and there wasn\u0027t a TV. There was a window in the waiting room - you would see the room from this perspective if you looked through it.\" Alice and Jasper were staring at me. \"Are you sure it\u0027s the same room?\" Jasper asked, still calm. \"No, not at all - I suppose most dance studios would look the same - the mirrors, the bar.\" I traced my finger along the ballet bar set against the mirrors. \"It\u0027s just the shape that looked familiar.\" I touched the door, set in exactly the same place as the one I remembered. \"Would you have any reason to go there now?\" Alice asked, breaking my reverie. \"No, I haven\u0027t been there in almost ten years. I was a terrible dancer - they always put me in the back for recitals,\" I admitted. \"So there\u0027s no way it could be connected with you?\" Alice asked intently. \"No, I don\u0027t even think the same person owns it. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s just another dance studio, somewhere.\" \"Where was the studio you went to?\" Jasper asked in a casual voice. \"It was just around the corner from my mom\u0027s house. I used to walk there after school...\" I said, my voice trailing off. I didn\u0027t miss the look they exchanged. \"Here in Phoenix, then?\" His voice was still casual. \"Yes,\" I whispered. \"Fifty-eighth Street and Cactus.\" We all sat in silence, staring at the drawing. \"Alice, is that phone safe?\" \"Yes,\" she reassured me. \"The number would just trace back to Washington.\" \"Then I can use it to call my mom.\" \"I thought she was in Florida.\" \"She is - but she\u0027s coming home soon, and she can\u0027t come back to that house while...\" My voice trembled. I was thinking about something Edward had said, about the red-haired female at Charlie\u0027s house, at the school, where my records would be. \"How will you reach her?\" \"They don\u0027t have a permanent number except at the house - she\u0027s supposed to check her messages regularly.\" \"Jasper?\" Alice asked. He thought about it. \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any way it could hurt - be sure you don\u0027t say where you are, of course.\" I reached eagerly for the phone and dialed the familiar number. It rang four times, and then I heard my mom\u0027s breezy voice telling me to leave a message. \"Mom,\" I said after the beep, \"it\u0027s me. Listen, I need you to do something. It\u0027s important. As soon as you get this message, call me at this number.\" Alice was already at my side, writing the number for me on the bottom of her picture. I read it carefully, twice. \"Please don\u0027t go anywhere until you talk to me. Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027m okay, but I have to talk to you right away, no matter how late you get this call, all right? I love you, Mom. Bye.\" I closed my eyes and prayed with all my might that no unforeseen change of plans would bring her home before she got my message. I settled into the sofa, nibbling on a plate of leftover fruit, anticipating a long evening. I thought about calling Charlie, but I wasn\u0027t sure if I should be home by now or not. I concentrated on the news, watching out for stories about Florida, or about spring training - strikes or hurricanes or terrorist attacks - anything that might send them home early. Immortality must grant endless patience. Neither Jasper nor Alice seemed to feel the need to do anything at all. For a while, Alice sketched the vague outline of the dark room from her vision, as much as she could see in the light from the TV. But when she was done, she simply sat, looking at the blank walls with her timeless eyes. Jasper, too, seemed to have no urge to pace, or peek through the curtains, or run screaming out the door, the way I did. I must have fallen asleep on the couch, waiting for the phone to ring again. The touch of Alice\u0027s cold hands woke me briefly as she carried me to the bed, but I was unconscious again before my head hit the pillow.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twilight-twilight-1/page-20.html","bookId":2023,"book":{"id":2023,"title":"Twilight (Twilight #1)","description":"Storyline: Twilight is a young-adult vampire-romance novel by author Stephenie Meyer.
