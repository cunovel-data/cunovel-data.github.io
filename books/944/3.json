He murmured a syllable into a tiny ball-mike on the side of the chair. A metallic hand raised a lighted cigarette to his lips. \"Come here, son.\" Ronnie followed and sat on the hassock by Dad\u0027s feet. \"Maybe I\u0027ve never really explained things to you, Ronnie. You see, you won\u0027t always be a boy. Someday you\u0027ll have to find a way of making a living. You\u0027ve only two choices: You work for the government, like I do, or for a corporation.\" Ronnie blinked. \"Mr. Davis doesn\u0027t work for the gover\u0027ment or for a corpor-ation.\" \"Mr. Davis isn\u0027t normal,\" Dad snapped. \"He\u0027s a hermit. No decent family would let him in their house. He grows his own food and sometimes he takes care of gardens for people. I want you to have more than that. I want you to have a nice home and be respected by people.\" Dad puffed furiously on his cigarette. \"And you can\u0027t get ahead if people know you\u0027ve been a Reader. That\u0027s something you can\u0027t live down. No matter how hard you try, people always stumble upon the truth.\" Dad cleared his throat. \"You see, when you get a job, all the information you handle will have a classification. It\u0027ll be Restricted, Low-Confidential, Confidential, High-Confidential, Secret, Top-Secret. And all this information will be in writing. No matter what you do, you\u0027ll have access to some of this information at one time or another.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3100/85424.html","bookId":944,"book":{"id":944,"title":"Juvenile Delinquent","description":"简介： Tick-de-tock, tick-de-tock, whispered the antique clock on the first floor of the house.There was no sound save for the tickingand for the pounding of Ronnie\u0027s heart....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3100","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:56 AM"}}
