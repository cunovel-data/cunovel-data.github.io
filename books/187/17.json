[bbe] And Elijah the Tishbite, of Tishbe in Gilead, said to Ahab, By the living Lord, the God of Israel, whose servant I am, there will be no dew or rain in these years, but only at my word. 17:2 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 话 临 到 以 利 亚 说 ， [kjv] And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, [bbe] Then the word of the Lord came to him, saying, 17:3 [hgb] 你 离 开 这 里 往 东 去 ， 藏 在 约 旦 河 东 边 的 基 立 溪 旁 。 [kjv] Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan. [bbe] Go from here in the direction of the east, and keep yourself in a secret place by the stream Cherith, east of Jordan. 17:4 [hgb] 你 要 喝 那 溪 里 的 水 ， 我 已 吩 咐 乌 鸦 在 那 里 供 养 你 。 [kjv] And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there. [bbe] The water of the stream will be your drink, and by my orders the ravens will give you food there. 17:5 [hgb] 于 是 以 利 亚 照 着 耶 和 华 的 话 ， 去 住 在 约 旦 河 东 的 基 立 溪 旁 。 [kjv] So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan. [bbe] So he went and did as the Lord said, living by the stream Cherith, east of Jordan. 17:6 [hgb] 乌 鸦 早 晚 给 他 叼 饼 和 肉 来 ， 他 也 喝 那 溪 里 的 水 。 [kjv] And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook. [bbe] And the ravens took him bread in the morning and meat in the evening; and the water of the stream was his drink. 17:7 [hgb] 过 了 些 日 子 ， 溪 水 就 干 了 ， 因 为 雨 没 有 下 在 地 上 。 [kjv] And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land. [bbe] Now after a time the stream became dry, because there was no rain in the land. 17:8 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 话 临 到 他 说 ， [kjv] And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, [bbe] Then the word of the Lord came to him, saying, 17:9 [hgb] 你 起 身 往 西 顿 的 撒 勒 法 去 （ 撒 勒 法 与 路 加 福 音 四 章 二 十 六 节 同 ） ， 住 在 那 里 。 我 已 吩 咐 那 里 的 一 个 寡 妇 供 养 你 。 [kjv] Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee. [bbe] Up! go now to Zarephath, in Zidon, and make your living-place there; I have given orders to a widow woman there to see that you have food. 17:10 [hgb] 以 利 亚 就 起 身 往 撒 勒 法 去 。 到 了 城 门 ， 见 有 一 个 寡 妇 在 那 里 捡 柴 ， 以 利 亚 呼 叫 她 说 ， 求 你 用 器 皿 取 点 水 来 给 我 喝 。 [kjv] So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink. [bbe] So he got up and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the door of the town, he saw a widow woman getting sticks together; and crying out to her he said, Will you give me a little water in a vessel for my drink? 17:11 [hgb] 她 去 取 水 的 时 候 ， 以 利 亚 又 呼 叫 她 说 ， 也 求 你 拿 点 饼 来 给 我 。 [kjv] And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand. [bbe] And when she was going to get it, he said to her, And get me with it a small bit of bread. 17:12 [hgb] 她 说 ， 我 指 着 永 生 耶 和 华 你 的 神 起 誓 ， 我 没 有 饼 ， 坛 内 只 有 一 把 面 ， 瓶 里 只 有 一 点 油 。 我 现 在 找 两 根 柴 ， 回 家 要 为 我 和 我 儿 子 作 饼 。 我 们 吃 了 ， 死 就 死 吧 。 [kjv] And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die. [bbe] Then she said, By the life of the Lord your God, I have nothing but a little meal in my store, and a drop of oil in the bottle; and now I am getting two sticks together so that I may go in and make it ready for me and my son, so that we may have a meal before our death. 17:13 [hgb] 以 利 亚 对 她 说 ， 不 要 惧 怕 。 可 以 照 你 所 说 的 去 作 吧 。 只 要 先 为 我 作 一 个 小 饼 拿 来 给 我 ， 然 后 为 你 和 你 的 儿 子 作 饼 。 [kjv] And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son. [bbe] And Elijah said to her, Have no fear; go and do as you have said, but first make me a little cake of it and come and give it to me, and then make something for yourself and your son. 17:14 [hgb] 因 为 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 如 此 说 ， 坛 内 的 面 必 不 减 少 ， 瓶 里 的 油 必 不 缺 短 ， 直 到 耶 和 华 使 雨 降 在 地 上 的 日 子 。 [kjv] For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth. [bbe] For this is the word of the Lord, the God of Israel: The store of meal will not come to an end, and the bottle will never be without oil, till the day when the Lord sends rain on the earth. 17:15 [hgb] 妇 人 就 照 以 利 亚 的 话 去 行 。 她 和 她 家 中 的 人 ， 并 以 利 亚 ， 吃 了 许 多 日 子 。 [kjv] And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days. [bbe] So she went and did as Elijah said; and she and he and her family had food for a long time. 17:16 [hgb] 坛 内 的 面 果 不 减 少 ， 瓶 里 的 油 也 不 缺 短 ， 正 如 耶 和 华 借 以 利 亚 所 说 的 话 。 [kjv] And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah. [bbe] The store of meal did not come to an end, and the bottle was never without oil, as the Lord had said by the mouth of Elijah. 17:17 [hgb] 这 事 以 后 ， 作 那 家 主 母 的 妇 人 ， 她 儿 子 病 了 。 病 得 甚 重 ， 以 致 身 无 气 息 。 [kjv] And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him. [bbe] Now after this, the son of the woman of the house became ill, so ill that there was no breath in him. 17:18 [hgb] 妇 人 对 以 利 亚 说 ， 神 人 哪 ， 我 与 你 何 干 ？ 你 竟 到 我 这 里 来 ， 使 神 想 念 我 的 罪 ， 以 致 我 的 儿 子 死 呢 ？ [kjv] And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son? [bbe] And she said to Elijah, What have I to do with you, O man of God? have you come to put God in mind of my sin, and to put my son to death? 17:19 [hgb] 以 利 亚 对 她 说 ， 把 你 儿 子 交 给 我 。 以 利 亚 就 从 妇 人 怀 中 将 孩 子 接 过 来 ， 抱 到 他 所 住 的 楼 中 ， 放 在 自 己 的 床 上 ， [kjv] And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed. [bbe] And he said to her, Give your son to me. And lifting him out of her arms, he took him up to his room and put him down on his bed. 17:20 [hgb] 就 求 告 耶 和 华 说 ， 耶 和 华 我 的 神 阿 ， 我 寄 居 在 这 寡 妇 的 家 里 ， 你 就 降 祸 与 她 ， 使 她 的 儿 子 死 了 吗 ？ [kjv] And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son? [bbe] And crying to the Lord he said, O Lord my God, have you sent evil even on the widow whose guest I am, by causing her son\u0027s death? 17:21 [hgb] 以 利 亚 三 次 伏 在 孩 子 的 身 上 ， 求 告 耶 和 华 说 ， 耶 和 华 我 的 神 阿 ， 求 你 使 这 孩 子 的 灵 魂 仍 入 他 的 身 体 。 [kjv] And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child\u0027s soul come into him again. [bbe] And stretching herself out on the child three times, he made his prayer to the Lord, saying, O Lord my God, be pleased to let this child\u0027s life come back to him again. 17:22 [hgb] 耶 和 华 应 允 以 利 亚 的 话 ， 孩 子 的 灵 魂 仍 入 他 的 身 体 ， 他 就 活 了 。 [kjv] And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived. [bbe] And the Lord gave ear to the voice of Elijah, and the child\u0027s spirit came into him again, and he came back to life. 17:23 [hgb] 以 利 亚 将 孩 子 从 楼 上 抱 下 来 ， 进 屋 子 交 给 他 母 亲 ， 说 ， 看 哪 ， 你 的 儿 子 活 了 。 [kjv] And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth. [bbe] And Elijah took the child down from his room into the house and gave him to his mother and said to her, See, your son is living. 17:24 [hgb] 妇 人 对 以 利 亚 说 ， 现 在 我 知 道 你 是 神 人 ， 耶 和 华 借 你 口 所 说 的 话 是 真 的 。 [kjv] And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth. [bbe] Then the woman said to Elijah, Now I am certain that you are a man of God, and that the word of the Lord in your mouth is true.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/107/1550.html","bookId":187,"book":{"id":187,"title":"Kings列王记上","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 大 卫 王 年 纪 老 迈 ， 虽 用 被 遮 盖 ， 仍 不 觉 暖 。 [kjv] Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat. ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/107","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
