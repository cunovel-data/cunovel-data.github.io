\\n\\n [bbe] Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his power, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel? \\n\\n 16:6 [hgb] 巴 沙 与 他 列 祖 同 睡 ， 葬 在 得 撒 。 他 儿 子 以 拉 接 续 他 作 王 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead. \\n\\n [bbe] And Baasha went to rest with his fathers, and was put into the earth at Tirzah; and Elah his son became king in his place. \\n\\n 16:7 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 话 临 到 哈 拿 尼 的 儿 子 先 知 耶 户 ， 责 备 巴 沙 和 他 的 家 ， 因 他 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 一 切 事 ， 以 他 手 所 作 的 惹 耶 和 华 发 怒 ， 像 耶 罗 波 安 的 家 一 样 ， 又 因 他 杀 了 耶 罗 波 安 的 全 家 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him. \\n\\n [bbe] And the Lord sent his word against Baasha and his family by the mouth of the prophet Jehu, the son of Hanani, because of all the evil he did in the eyes of the Lord, moving him to wrath by the work of his hands, because he was like the family of Jeroboam, and because he put it to death. \\n\\n 16:8 [hgb] 犹 大 王 亚 撒 二 十 六 年 ， 巴 沙 的 儿 子 以 拉 在 得 撒 登 基 作 以 色 列 王 共 二 年 。 \\n\\n [kjv] In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years. \\n\\n [bbe] In the twenty-sixth year that Asa was king of Judah, Elah, the son of Baasha, became king of Israel in Tirzah, and he was king for two years. \\n\\n 16:9 [hgb] 有 管 理 他 一 半 战 车 的 臣 子 心 利 背 叛 他 。 当 他 在 得 撒 家 宰 亚 杂 家 里 喝 醉 的 时 候 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah. \\n\\n [bbe] And his servant Zimri, captain of half his war-carriages, made secret designs against him: now he was in Tirzah, drinking hard in the house of Arza, controller of the king\u0027s house in Tirzah. \\n\\n 16:10 [hgb] 心 利 就 进 去 杀 了 他 ， 篡 了 他 的 位 。 这 是 犹 大 王 亚 撒 二 十 七 年 的 事 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead. \\n\\n [bbe] And Zimri went in and made an attack on him and put him to death, in the twenty-seventh year that Asa was king of Judah, and made himself king in his place. \\n\\n 16:11 [hgb] 心 利 一 坐 王 位 就 杀 了 巴 沙 的 全 家 ， 连 他 的 亲 属 ， 朋 友 也 没 有 留 下 一 个 男 丁 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends. \\n\\n [bbe] And straight away when he became king and took his place on the seat of the kingdom, he put to death all the family of Baasha: not one male child of his relations or his friends kept his life. \\n\\n 16:12 [hgb] 心 利 这 样 灭 绝 巴 沙 的 全 家 ， 正 如 耶 和 华 借 先 知 耶 户 责 备 巴 沙 的 话 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet, \\n\\n [bbe] So Zimri put to death all the family of Baasha, so that the word which the Lord said against him by the mouth of Jehu the prophet came about; \\n\\n 16:13 [hgb] 这 是 因 巴 沙 和 他 儿 子 以 拉 的 一 切 罪 ， 就 是 他 们 使 以 色 列 人 陷 在 罪 里 的 那 罪 ， 以 虚 无 的 神 惹 耶 和 华 以 色 列 神 的 怒 气 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities. \\n\\n [bbe] Because of all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, which they did and made Israel do, moving the Lord, the God of Israel, to wrath by their foolish acts. \\n\\n 16:14 [hgb] 以 拉 其 余 的 事 ， 凡 他 所 行 的 ， 都 写 在 以 色 列 诸 王 记 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? \\n\\n [bbe] Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all he did, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel? \\n\\n 16:15 [hgb] 犹 大 王 亚 撒 二 十 七 年 ， 心 利 在 得 撒 作 王 七 日 。 那 时 民 正 安 营 围 攻 非 利 士 的 基 比 顿 。 \\n\\n [kjv] In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines. \\n\\n [bbe] In the twenty-seventh year of Asa, king of Judah, Zimri was king for seven days in Tirzah. Now the people were attacking Gibbethon in the land of the Philistines. \\n\\n 16:16 [hgb] 民 在 营 中 听 说 心 利 背 叛 ， 又 杀 了 王 ， 故 此 以 色 列 众 人 当 日 在 营 中 立 元 帅 暗 利 作 以 色 列 王 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp. \\n\\n [bbe] And news came to the people in the tents that Zimri had made a secret design and had put the king to death: so all Israel made Omri, the captain of the army, king that day in the tents. \\n\\n 16:17 [hgb] 暗 利 率 领 以 色 列 众 人 ， 从 基 比 顿 上 去 ， 围 困 得 撒 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Omri went up from Gibbethon, with all the army of Israel, and they made an attack on Tirzah, shutting in the town on every side. \\n\\n 16:18 [hgb] 心 利 见 城 破 失 ， 就 进 了 王 宫 的 卫 所 ， 放 火 焚 烧 宫 殿 ， 自 焚 而 死 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king\u0027s house, and burnt the king\u0027s house over him with fire, and died, \\n\\n [bbe] And when Zimri saw that the town was taken, he went into the inner room of the king\u0027s house, and burning the house over his head, came to his end, \\n\\n 16:19 [hgb] 这 是 因 他 犯 罪 ， 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 事 ， 行 耶 罗 波 安 所 行 的 ， 犯 他 使 以 色 列 人 陷 在 罪 里 的 那 罪 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin. \\n\\n [bbe] Because of his sin in doing evil in the eyes of the Lord, in going in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin which he made Israel do. \\n\\n 16:20 [hgb] 心 利 其 余 的 事 和 他 背 叛 的 情 形 都 写 在 以 色 列 诸 王 记 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? \\n\\n [bbe] Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and the secret design he made, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel? \\n\\n 16:21 [hgb] 那 时 ， 以 色 列 民 分 为 两 半 ， 一 半 随 从 基 纳 的 儿 子 提 比 尼 ， 要 立 他 作 王 。 一 半 随 从 暗 利 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri. \\n\\n [bbe] Then there was a division among the people of Israel; half the people were for making Tibni, son of Ginath, king, and half were supporting Omri. \\n\\n 16:22 [hgb] 但 随 从 暗 利 的 民 胜 过 随 从 基 纳 的 儿 子 提 比 尼 的 民 。 提 比 尼 死 了 ， 暗 利 就 作 了 王 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned. \\n\\n [bbe] But the supporters of Omri overcame those who were on the side of Tibni, the son of Ginath; and death came to Tibni and to his brother Joram at that time: and Omri became king in the place of Tibni. \\n\\n 16:23 [hgb] 犹 大 王 亚 撒 三 十 一 年 ， 暗 利 登 基 作 以 色 列 王 共 十 二 年 。 在 得 撒 作 王 六 年 。 \\n\\n [kjv] In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah. \\n\\n [bbe] In the thirty-first year of Asa, king of Judah, Omri became king over Israel, and he was king for twelve years; for six years he was ruling in Tirzah. \\n\\n 16:24 [hgb] 暗 利 用 二 他 连 得 银 子 向 撒 玛 买 了 撒 玛 利 亚 山 ， 在 山 上 造 城 ， 就 按 着 山 的 原 主 撒 玛 的 名 ， 给 所 造 的 城 起 名 叫 撒 玛 利 亚 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria. \\n\\n [bbe] He got the hill Samaria from Shemer for the price of two talents of silver, and he made a town there, building it on the hill and naming it Samaria, after Shemer the owner of the hill. \\n\\n 16:25 [hgb] 暗 利 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 事 ， 比 他 以 前 的 列 王 作 恶 更 甚 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all that were before him. \\n\\n [bbe] And Omri did evil in the eyes of the Lord, even worse than all those before him, \\n\\n 16:26 [hgb] 因 他 行 了 尼 八 的 儿 子 耶 罗 波 安 所 行 的 ， 犯 他 使 以 色 列 人 陷 在 罪 里 的 那 罪 ， 以 虚 无 的 神 惹 耶 和 华 以 色 列 神 的 怒 气 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities. \\n\\n [bbe] Copying all the evil ways of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and all the sins he did and made Israel do, moving the Lord, the God of Israel, to wrath by their foolish ways. \\n\\n 16:27 [hgb] 暗 利 其 余 的 事 和 他 所 显 出 的 勇 力 都 写 在 以 色 列 诸 王 记 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he shewed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? \\n\\n [bbe] Now the rest of the acts which Omri did, and his great power, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel? \\n\\n 16:28 [hgb] 暗 利 与 他 列 祖 同 睡 ， 葬 在 撒 玛 利 亚 。 他 儿 子 亚 哈 接 续 他 作 王 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead. \\n\\n [bbe] So Omri went to rest with his fathers, and was put into the earth in Samaria; and Ahab his son became king in his place. \\n\\n 16:29 [hgb] 犹 大 王 亚 撒 三 十 八 年 ， 暗 利 的 儿 子 亚 哈 登 基 作 了 以 色 列 王 。 暗 利 的 儿 子 亚 哈 在 撒 玛 利 亚 作 以 色 列 王 二 十 二 年 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years. \\n\\n [bbe] In the thirty-eighth year that Asa was king of Judah, Ahab, the son of Omri, became king over Israel; and Ahab was king in Samaria for twenty-two years. \\n\\n 16:30 [hgb] 暗 利 的 儿 子 亚 哈 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 事 ， 比 他 以 前 的 列 王 更 甚 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that were before him. \\n\\n [bbe] And Ahab, the son of Omri, did evil in the eyes of the Lord, even worse than all who went before him. \\n\\n 16:31 [hgb] 犯 了 尼 八 的 儿 子 耶 罗 波 安 所 犯 的 罪 。 他 还 以 为 轻 ， 又 娶 了 西 顿 王 谒 巴 力 的 女 儿 耶 洗 别 为 妻 ， 去 事 奉 敬 拜 巴 力 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him. \\n\\n [bbe] And as if copying the evil ways of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, was a small thing for him, he took as his wife Jezebel, daughter of Ethbaal, king of Zidon, and became a servant and worshipper of Baal. \\n\\n 16:32 [hgb] 在 撒 玛 利 亚 建 造 巴 力 的 庙 ， 在 庙 里 为 巴 力 筑 坛 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria. \\n\\n [bbe] And he put up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal which he had made in Samaria. \\n\\n 16:33 [hgb] 亚 哈 又 作 亚 舍 拉 ， 他 所 行 的 惹 耶 和 华 以 色 列 神 的 怒 气 ， 比 他 以 前 的 以 色 列 诸 王 更 甚 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him. \\n\\n [bbe] And Ahab made an image of Asherah and did more than all the kings of Israel before him to make the Lord, the God of Israel, angry. \\n\\n 16:34 [hgb] 亚 哈 在 位 的 时 候 ， 有 伯 特 利 人 希 伊 勒 重 修 耶 利 哥 城 。 立 根 基 的 时 候 ， 丧 了 长 子 亚 比 兰 。 安 门 的 时 候 ， 丧 了 幼 子 西 割 ， 正 如 耶 和 华 借 嫩 的 儿 子 约 书 亚 所 说 的 话 。 \\n\\n [kjv] In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun. \\n\\n [bbe] In his days Hiel made Jericho; he put its base in position at the price of Abiram, his oldest son, and he put its doors in place at the price of his youngest son Segub; even as the Lord had said by Joshua, the son of Nun. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/107/1549.html","bookId":187,"book":{"id":187,"title":"Kings列王记上","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 大 卫 王 年 纪 老 迈 ， 虽 用 被 遮 盖 ， 仍 不 觉 暖 。 [kjv] Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat. ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/107","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
