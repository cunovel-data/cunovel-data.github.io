And there was a sore famine in Samaria. \n [bbe] So Elijah went to let Ahab see him. Now there was no food to be had in Samaria. \n 18:3 [hgb] 亚 哈 将 他 的 家 宰 俄 巴 底 召 了 来 。 俄 巴 底 甚 是 敬 畏 耶 和 华 ， \n [kjv] And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly: \n [bbe] And Ahab sent for Obadiah, the controller of the king\u0027s house. (Now Obadiah had the fear of the Lord before him greatly; \n 18:4 [hgb] 耶 洗 别 杀 耶 和 华 众 先 知 的 时 候 ， 俄 巴 底 将 一 百 个 先 知 藏 了 ， 每 五 十 人 藏 在 一 个 洞 里 ， 拿 饼 和 水 供 养 他 们 。 \n [kjv] For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.) \n [bbe] For when Jezebel was cutting off the prophets of the Lord, Obadiah took a hundred of them, and kept them secretly in a hole in the rock, fifty at a time, and gave them bread and water.) \n 18:5 [hgb] 亚 哈 对 俄 巴 底 说 ， 我 们 走 遍 这 地 ， 到 一 切 水 泉 旁 和 一 切 溪 边 ， 或 者 找 得 着 青 草 ， 可 以 救 活 骡 马 ， 免 得 绝 了 牲 畜 。 \n [kjv] And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts. \n [bbe] And Ahab said to Obadiah, Come, let us go through all the country, to all the fountains of water and all the rivers, and see if there is any grass to be had for the horses and the transport beasts, so that we may be able to keep some of the beasts from destruction. \n 18:6 [hgb] 于 是 二 人 分 地 游 行 ， 亚 哈 独 走 一 路 ， 俄 巴 底 独 走 一 路 。 \n [kjv] So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself. \n [bbe] So they went through all the country, covering it between them; Ahab went in one direction by himself, and Obadiah went in another by himself. \n 18:7 [hgb] 俄 巴 底 在 路 上 恰 与 以 利 亚 相 遇 ， 俄 巴 底 认 出 他 来 ， 就 俯 伏 在 地 ， 说 ， 你 是 我 主 以 利 亚 不 是 。 \n [kjv] And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah? \n [bbe] And while Obadiah was on his way, he came face to face with Elijah; and seeing who it was, he went down on his face and said, Is it you, my lord Elijah? \n 18:8 [hgb] 回 答 说 ， 是 。 你 去 告 诉 你 主 人 说 ， 以 利 亚 在 这 里 。 \n [kjv] And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here. \n [bbe] And Elijah in answer said, It is I; now go and say to your lord, Elijah is here. \n 18:9 [hgb] 俄 巴 底 说 ， 仆 人 有 什 么 罪 ， 你 竟 要 将 我 交 在 亚 哈 手 里 ， 使 他 杀 我 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me? \n [bbe] And he said, What sin have I done, that you would give up your servant into the hand of Ahab, and be the cause of my death? \n 18:10 [hgb] 我 指 着 永 生 耶 和 华 你 的 神 起 誓 ， 无 论 哪 一 邦 哪 一 国 ， 我 主 都 打 发 人 去 找 你 。 若 说 你 没 有 在 那 里 ， 就 必 使 那 邦 那 国 的 人 起 誓 说 ， 实 在 是 找 不 着 你 。 \n [kjv] As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not. \n [bbe] By the life of the Lord your God, there is not a nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent in search of you; and when they said, He is not here; he made them take an oath that they had not seen you. \n 18:11 [hgb] 现 在 你 说 ， 要 去 告 诉 你 主 人 说 ， 以 利 亚 在 这 里 。 \n [kjv] And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here. \n [bbe] And now you say, Go, say to your lord, Elijah is here. \n 18:12 [hgb] 恐 怕 我 一 离 开 你 ， 耶 和 华 的 灵 就 提 你 到 我 所 不 知 道 的 地 方 去 。 这 样 ， 我 去 告 诉 亚 哈 ， 他 若 找 不 着 你 ， 就 必 杀 我 。 仆 人 却 是 自 幼 敬 畏 耶 和 华 的 。 \n [kjv] And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth. \n [bbe] And straight away, when I have gone from you, the spirit of the Lord will take you away, I have no idea where, so that when I come and give word to Ahab, and he sees you not, he will put me to death: though I, your servant, have been a worshipper of the Lord from my earliest years. \n 18:13 [hgb] 耶 洗 别 杀 耶 和 华 众 先 知 的 时 候 ， 我 将 耶 和 华 的 一 百 个 先 知 藏 了 ， 每 五 十 人 藏 在 一 个 洞 里 ， 拿 饼 和 水 供 养 他 们 ， 岂 没 有 人 将 这 事 告 诉 我 主 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD\u0027s prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water? \n [bbe] Has my lord not had word of what I did when Jezebel was putting the Lord\u0027s prophets to death? how I kept a hundred of them in a secret hole in the rock, fifty at a time, and gave them bread and water? \n 18:14 [hgb] 现 在 你 说 ， 要 去 告 诉 你 主 人 说 ， 以 利 亚 在 这 里 ， 他 必 杀 我 。 \n [kjv] And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he shall slay me. \n [bbe] And now you say, Go and say to your Lord, Elijah is here; and he will put me to death. \n 18:15 [hgb] 以 利 亚 说 ， 我 指 着 所 事 奉 永 生 的 万 军 之 耶 和 华 起 誓 ， 我 今 日 必 使 亚 哈 得 见 我 。 \n [kjv] And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day. \n [bbe] And Elijah said, By the life of the Lord of armies, whose servant I am, I will certainly let him see me today. \n 18:16 [hgb] 于 是 俄 巴 底 去 迎 着 亚 哈 ， 告 诉 他 。 亚 哈 就 去 迎 着 以 利 亚 。 \n [kjv] So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah. \n [bbe] So Obadiah went to Ahab and gave him the news; and Ahab went to see Elijah. \n 18:17 [hgb] 亚 哈 见 了 以 利 亚 ， 便 说 ， 使 以 色 列 遭 灾 的 就 是 你 吗 ？ \n [kjv] And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel? \n [bbe] And when he saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, Is it you, you troubler of Israel? \n 18:18 [hgb] 以 利 亚 说 ， 使 以 色 列 遭 灾 的 不 是 我 ， 乃 是 你 和 你 父 家 。 因 为 你 们 离 弃 耶 和 华 的 诫 命 ， 去 随 从 巴 力 。 \n [kjv] And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father\u0027s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim. \n [bbe] Then he said in answer, I have not been troubling Israel, but you and your family; because, turning away from the orders of the Lord, you have gone after the Baals. \n 18:19 [hgb] 现 在 你 当 差 遣 人 ， 招 聚 以 色 列 众 人 和 事 奉 巴 力 的 那 四 百 五 十 个 先 知 ， 并 耶 洗 别 所 供 养 事 奉 亚 舍 拉 的 那 四 百 个 先 知 ， 使 他 们 都 上 迦 密 山 去 见 我 。 \n [kjv] Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel\u0027s table. \n [bbe] Now send, and get Israel together before me at Mount Carmel, with the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal who get their food at Jezebel\u0027s table. \n 18:20 [hgb] 亚 哈 就 差 遣 人 招 聚 以 色 列 众 人 和 先 知 都 上 迦 密 山 。 \n [kjv] So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel. \n [bbe] So Ahab sent for all the children of Israel, and got the prophets together at Mount Carmel. \n 18:21 [hgb] 以 利 亚 前 来 对 众 民 说 ， 你 们 心 持 两 意 要 到 几 时 呢 ？ 若 耶 和 华 是 神 ， 就 当 顺 从 耶 和 华 。 若 巴 力 是 神 ， 就 当 顺 从 巴 力 。 众 民 一 言 不 答 。 \n [kjv] And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word. \n [bbe] And Elijah came near to all the people and said, How long will you go on balancing between two opinions? if the Lord is God, then give worship to him; but if Baal, give worship to him. And the people said not a word in answer. \n 18:22 [hgb] 以 利 亚 对 众 民 说 ， 作 耶 和 华 先 知 的 只 剩 下 我 一 个 人 。 巴 力 的 先 知 却 有 四 百 五 十 个 人 。 \n [kjv] Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal\u0027s prophets are four hundred and fifty men. \n [bbe] Then Elijah said to the people, I, even I, am the only living prophet of the Lord; but Baal\u0027s prophets are four hundred and fifty men. \n 18:23 [hgb] 当 给 我 们 两 只 牛 犊 ， 巴 力 的 先 知 可 以 挑 选 一 只 ， 切 成 块 子 ， 放 在 柴 上 ， 不 要 点 火 。 我 也 预 备 一 只 牛 犊 放 在 柴 上 ， 也 不 点 火 。 \n [kjv] Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: \n [bbe] Now, let them give us two oxen; and let them take one for themselves, and have it cut up, and put it on the wood, but put no fire under it; I will get the other ox ready, and put it on the wood, and put no fire under it. \n 18:24 [hgb] 你 们 求 告 你 们 神 的 名 ， 我 也 求 告 耶 和 华 的 名 。 那 降 火 显 应 的 神 ， 就 是 神 。 众 民 回 答 说 ， 这 话 甚 好 。 \n [kjv] And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken. \n [bbe] And do you make prayers to your god, and I will make a prayer to the Lord: and it will be clear that the one who gives an answer by fire is God. And all the people in answer said, It is well said. \n 18:25 [hgb] 以 利 亚 对 巴 力 的 先 知 说 ， 你 们 既 是 人 多 ， 当 先 挑 选 一 只 牛 犊 ， 预 备 好 了 ， 就 求 告 你 们 神 的 名 ， 却 不 要 点 火 。 \n [kjv] And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under. \n [bbe] Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, Take one ox for yourselves and get it ready first, for there are more of you; and make your prayers to your god, but put no fire under. \n 18:26 [hgb] 他 们 将 所 得 的 牛 犊 预 备 好 了 ， 从 早 晨 到 午 间 ， 求 告 巴 力 的 名 说 ， 巴 力 阿 ， 求 你 应 允 我 们 。 却 没 有 声 音 ， 没 有 应 允 的 。 他 们 在 所 筑 的 坛 四 围 踊 跳 。 \n [kjv] And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made. \n [bbe] So they took the ox which was given them, and made it ready, crying out to Baal from morning till the middle of the day, and saying, O Baal, give ear to us. But there was no voice and no answer. And they were jumping up and down before the altar they had made. \n 18:27 [hgb] 到 了 正 午 ， 以 利 亚 嬉 笑 他 们 ， 说 ， 大 声 求 告 吧 。 因 为 他 是 神 ， 他 或 默 想 ， 或 走 到 一 边 ， 或 行 路 ， 或 睡 觉 ， 你 们 当 叫 醒 他 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked. \n [bbe] And in the middle of the day, Elijah made sport of them, saying, Give louder cries, for he is a god; he may be deep in thought, or he may have gone away for some purpose, or he may be on a journey, or by chance he is sleeping and has to be made awake. \n 18:28 [hgb] 他 们 大 声 求 告 ， 按 着 他 们 的 规 矩 ， 用 刀 枪 自 割 ， 自 刺 ， 直 到 身 体 流 血 。 \n [kjv] And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them. \n [bbe] So they gave loud cries, cutting themselves with knives and swords, as was their way, till the blood came streaming out all over them. \n 18:29 [hgb] 从 午 后 直 到 献 晚 祭 的 时 候 ， 他 们 狂 呼 乱 叫 ， 却 没 有 声 音 ， 没 有 应 允 的 ， 也 没 有 理 会 的 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded. \n [bbe] And from the middle of the day they went on with their prayers till the time of the offering; but there was no voice, or any answer, or any who gave attention to them. \n 18:30 [hgb] 以 利 亚 对 众 民 说 ， 你 们 到 我 这 里 来 。 众 民 就 到 他 那 里 。 他 便 重 修 已 经 毁 坏 耶 和 华 的 坛 。 \n [kjv] And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down. \n [bbe] Then Elijah said to all the people, Come near to me; and all the people came near. And he put up again the altar of the Lord which had been broken down. \n 18:31 [hgb] 以 利 亚 照 雅 各 子 孙 支 派 的 数 目 ， 取 了 十 二 块 石 头 （ 耶 和 华 的 话 曾 临 到 雅 各 说 ， 你 的 名 要 叫 以 色 列 ） ， \n [kjv] And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name: \n [bbe] And Elijah took twelve stones, the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the Lord had said, Israel will be your name: \n 18:32 [hgb] 用 这 些 石 头 为 耶 和 华 的 名 筑 一 座 坛 ， 在 坛 的 四 围 挖 沟 ， 可 容 谷 种 二 细 亚 ， \n [kjv] And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed. \n [bbe] And with the stones he made an altar to the name of the Lord; and he made a deep drain all round the altar, great enough to take two measures of seed. \n 18:33 [hgb] 又 在 坛 上 摆 好 了 柴 ， 把 牛 犊 切 成 块 子 放 在 柴 上 ， 对 众 人 说 ， 你 们 用 四 个 桶 盛 满 水 ， 倒 在 燔 祭 和 柴 上 。 \n [kjv] And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood. \n [bbe] And he put the wood in order, and, cutting up the ox, put it on the wood. Then he said, Get four vessels full of water and put it on the burned offering and on the wood. And he said, Do it a second time, and they did it a second time; \n 18:34 [hgb] 又 说 ， 倒 第 二 次 。 他 们 就 倒 第 二 次 。 又 说 ， 倒 第 三 次 。 他 们 就 倒 第 三 次 。 \n [kjv] And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time. \n [bbe] And he said, Do it a third time, and they did it a third time. \n 18:35 [hgb] 水 流 在 坛 的 四 围 ， 沟 里 也 满 了 水 。 \n [kjv] And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water. \n [bbe] And the water went all round the altar, till the drain was full. \n 18:36 [hgb] 到 了 献 晚 祭 的 时 候 ， 先 知 以 利 亚 近 前 来 ， 说 ， 亚 伯 拉 罕 ， 以 撒 ， 以 色 列 的 神 ， 耶 和 华 阿 ， 求 你 今 日 使 人 知 道 你 是 以 色 列 的 神 ， 也 知 道 我 是 你 的 仆 人 ， 又 是 奉 你 的 命 行 这 一 切 事 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word. \n [bbe] Then at the time of the offering, Elijah the prophet came near and said, O Lord, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it be seen this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things by your order. \n 18:37 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 求 你 应 允 我 ， 应 允 我 。 使 这 民 知 道 你 耶 和 华 是 神 ， 又 知 道 是 你 叫 这 民 的 心 回 转 。 \n [kjv] Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again. \n [bbe] Give me an answer, O Lord, give me an answer, so that this people may see that you are God, and that you have made their hearts come back again. \n 18:38 [hgb] 于 是 ， 耶 和 华 降 下 火 来 ， 烧 尽 燔 祭 ， 木 柴 ， 石 头 ， 尘 土 ， 又 烧 干 沟 里 的 水 。 \n [kjv] Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. \n [bbe] Then the fire of the Lord came down, burning up the offering and the wood and the stones and the dust, and drinking up the water in the drain. \n 18:39 [hgb] 众 民 看 见 了 ， 就 俯 伏 在 地 ， 说 ， 耶 和 华 是 神 。 耶 和 华 是 神 。 \n [kjv] And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God. \n [bbe] And when the people saw it, they all went down on their faces, and said, The Lord, he is God, the Lord, he is God. \n 18:40 [hgb] 以 利 亚 对 他 们 说 ， 拿 住 巴 力 的 先 知 ， 不 容 一 人 逃 脱 。 众 人 就 拿 住 他 们 。 以 利 亚 带 他 们 到 基 顺 河 边 ， 在 那 里 杀 了 他 们 。 \n [kjv] And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there. \n [bbe] And Elijah said to them, Take the prophets of Baal, let not one of them get away. So they took them, and Elijah made them go down to the stream Kishon, and put them to death there. \n 18:41 [hgb] 以 利 亚 对 亚 哈 说 ， 你 现 在 可 以 上 去 吃 喝 ， 因 为 有 多 雨 的 响 声 了 。 \n [kjv] And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain. \n [bbe] Then Elijah said to Ahab, Up! take food and drink, for there is a sound of much rain. \n 18:42 [hgb] 亚 哈 就 上 去 吃 喝 。 以 利 亚 上 了 迦 密 山 顶 ， 屈 身 在 地 ， 将 脸 伏 在 两 膝 之 中 。 \n [kjv] So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees, \n [bbe] So Ahab went up to have food and drink, while Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he went down on the earth, putting his face between his knees. \n 18:43 [hgb] 对 仆 人 说 ， 你 上 去 ， 向 海 观 看 。 仆 人 就 上 去 观 看 ， 说 ， 没 有 什 么 。 他 说 ， 你 再 去 观 看 。 如 此 七 次 。 \n [kjv] And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times. \n [bbe] And he said to his servant, Go now, and take a look in the direction of the sea. And he went up, and after looking said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times; and he went seven times. \n 18:44 [hgb] 第 七 次 仆 人 说 ， 我 看 见 有 一 小 片 云 从 海 里 上 来 ， 不 过 如 人 手 那 样 大 。 以 利 亚 说 ， 你 上 去 告 诉 亚 哈 ， 当 套 车 下 去 ， 免 得 被 雨 阻 挡 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man\u0027s hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not. \n [bbe] And the seventh time he said, I see a cloud coming up out of the sea, as small as a man\u0027s hand. Then he said, Go up and say to Ahab, Get your carriage ready and go down or the rain will keep you back. \n 18:45 [hgb] 霎 时 间 ， 天 因 风 云 黑 暗 ， 降 下 大 雨 。 亚 哈 就 坐 车 往 耶 斯 列 去 了 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel. \n [bbe] And after a very little time, the heaven became black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab went in his carriage to Jezreel. \n 18:46 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 灵 （ 原 文 作 手 ） 降 在 以 利 亚 身 上 ， 他 就 束 上 腰 ， 奔 在 亚 哈 前 头 ， 直 到 耶 斯 列 的 城 门 。 \n [kjv] And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel. \n [bbe] And the hand of the Lord was on Elijah; and he made himself strong, and went running before Ahab till they came to Jezreel. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/107/1551.html","bookId":187,"book":{"id":187,"title":"Kings列王记上","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 大 卫 王 年 纪 老 迈 ， 虽 用 被 遮 盖 ， 仍 不 觉 暖 。 [kjv] Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat. ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/107","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
