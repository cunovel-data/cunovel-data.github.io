{"id":5802,"no":14,"title":"Chapter 14","content":"14:1 [hgb] 那 时 ， 耶 罗 波 安 的 儿 子 亚 比 雅 病 了 。 [kjv] At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick. [bbe] At that time Abijah, the son of Jeroboam, became ill. 14:2 [hgb] 耶 罗 波 安 对 他 的 妻 说 ， 你 可 以 起 来 改 装 ， 使 人 不 知 道 你 是 耶 罗 波 安 的 妻 ， 往 示 罗 去 ， 在 那 里 有 先 知 亚 希 雅 。 他 曾 告 诉 我 说 ， 你 必 作 这 民 的 王 。 [kjv] And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, which told me that I should be king over this people. [bbe] And Jeroboam said to his wife, Now come, put on different clothing so that you may not seem to be the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Shiloh; see, Ahijah is there, the prophet who said I would be king over this people. 14:3 [hgb] 现 在 你 要 带 十 个 饼 ， 与 几 个 薄 饼 ， 和 一 瓶 蜜 去 见 他 ， 他 必 告 诉 你 儿 子 将 要 怎 样 。 [kjv] And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the child. [bbe] And take with you ten cakes of bread and dry cakes and a pot of honey, and go to him: he will give you word of what is to become of the child. 14:4 [hgb] 耶 罗 波 安 的 妻 就 这 样 行 ， 起 身 往 示 罗 去 ， 到 了 亚 希 雅 的 家 。 亚 希 雅 因 年 纪 老 迈 ， 眼 目 发 直 ， 不 能 看 见 。 [kjv] And Jeroboam\u0027s wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age. [bbe] So Jeroboam\u0027s wife did so, and got up and went to Shiloh and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah was unable to see, because he was very old. 14:5 [hgb] 耶 和 华 先 晓 谕 亚 希 雅 说 ， 耶 罗 波 安 的 妻 要 来 问 你 ， 因 她 儿 子 病 了 ， 你 当 如 此 如 此 告 诉 她 。 她 进 来 的 时 候 必 装 作 别 的 妇 人 。 [kjv] And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she shall feign herself to be another woman. [bbe] And the Lord had said to Ahijah, The wife of Jeroboam is coming to get news from you about her son, who is ill; give her such and such an answer; for she will make herself seem to be another woman. 14:6 [hgb] 她 刚 进 门 ， 亚 希 雅 听 见 她 脚 步 的 响 声 ， 就 说 ， 耶 罗 波 安 的 妻 ， 进 来 吧 。 你 为 何 装 作 别 的 妇 人 呢 ？ 我 奉 差 遣 将 凶 事 告 诉 你 。 [kjv] And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings. [bbe] Then Ahijah, hearing the sound of her footsteps coming in at the door, said, Come in, O wife of Jeroboam; why do you make yourself seem like another? for I am sent to you with bitter news. 14:7 [hgb] 你 回 去 告 诉 耶 罗 波 安 说 ， 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 如 此 说 ， 我 从 民 中 将 你 高 举 ， 立 你 作 我 民 以 色 列 的 君 ， [kjv] Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel, [bbe] Go, say to Jeroboam, These are the words of the Lord, the God of Israel: Though I took you from among the people, lifting you up to be a ruler over my people Israel, 14:8 [hgb] 将 国 从 大 卫 家 夺 回 赐 给 你 。 你 却 不 效 法 我 仆 人 大 卫 ， 遵 守 我 的 诫 命 ， 一 心 顺 从 我 ， 行 我 眼 中 看 为 正 的 事 。 [kjv] And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in mine eyes; [bbe] And took the kingdom away by force from the seed of David and gave it to you, you have not been like my servant David, who kept my orders, and was true to me with all his heart, doing only what was right in my eyes. 14:9 [hgb] 你 竟 行 恶 ， 比 那 在 你 以 先 的 更 甚 ， 为 自 己 立 了 别 神 ， 铸 了 偶 像 ， 惹 我 发 怒 ， 将 我 丢 在 背 后 。 [kjv] But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back: [bbe] But you have done evil more than any before you, and have made for yourself other gods, and images of metal, moving me to wrath, and turning your back on me. 14:10 [hgb] 因 此 ， 我 必 使 灾 祸 临 到 耶 罗 波 安 的 家 ， 将 属 耶 罗 波 安 的 男 丁 ， 无 论 困 住 的 ， 自 由 的 都 从 以 色 列 中 剪 除 ， 必 除 尽 耶 罗 波 安 的 家 ， 如 人 除 尽 粪 土 一 般 。 [kjv] Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it be all gone. [bbe] So I will send evil on the line of Jeroboam, cutting off from his family every male child, those who are shut up and those who go free in Israel; the family of Jeroboam will be brushed away like a man brushing away waste till it is all gone. 14:11 [hgb] 凡 属 耶 罗 波 安 的 人 ， 死 在 城 中 的 必 被 狗 吃 ， 死 在 田 野 的 必 被 空 中 的 鸟 吃 。 这 是 耶 和 华 说 的 。 [kjv] Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the LORD hath spoken it. [bbe] Those of the family of Jeroboam who come to death in the town, will become food for the dogs; and those on whom death comes in the open country, will be food for the birds of the air; for the Lord has said it. 14:12 [hgb] 所 以 你 起 身 回 家 去 吧 。 你 的 脚 一 进 城 ， 你 儿 子 就 必 死 了 。 [kjv] Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die. [bbe] Up, then! go back to your house; and in the hour when your feet go into the town, the death of the child will take place. 14:13 [hgb] 以 色 列 众 人 必 为 他 哀 哭 ， 将 他 葬 埋 。 凡 属 耶 罗 波 安 的 人 ， 惟 有 他 得 入 坟 墓 。 因 为 在 耶 罗 波 安 的 家 中 ， 只 有 他 向 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 显 出 善 行 。 [kjv] And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam. [bbe] And all Israel will put his body to rest, weeping over him, because he only of the family of Jeroboam will be put into his resting-place in the earth; for of all the family of Jeroboam, in him only has the Lord, the God of Israel, seen some good. 14:14 [hgb] 耶 和 华 必 另 立 一 王 治 理 以 色 列 。 到 了 日 期 ， 他 必 剪 除 耶 罗 波 安 的 家 。 那 日 期 已 经 到 了 。 [kjv] Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now. [bbe] And the Lord will put up a king over Israel who will send destruction on the family of Jeroboam in that day; 14:15 [hgb] 耶 和 华 必 击 打 以 色 列 人 ， 使 他 们 摇 动 ， 像 水 中 的 芦 苇 一 般 。 又 将 他 们 从 耶 和 华 赐 给 他 们 列 祖 的 美 地 上 拔 出 来 ， 分 散 在 大 河 那 边 。 因 为 他 们 作 木 偶 ， 惹 耶 和 华 发 怒 。 [kjv] For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger. [bbe] And even now the hand of the Lord has come down on Israel, shaking it like a river-grass in the water; and, uprooting Israel from this good land, which he gave to their fathers, he will send them this way and that on the other side of the River; because they have made for themselves images, moving the Lord to wrath. 14:16 [hgb] 因 耶 罗 波 安 所 犯 的 罪 ， 又 使 以 色 列 人 陷 在 罪 里 ， 耶 和 华 必 将 以 色 列 人 交 给 仇 敌 。 [kjv] And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and who made Israel to sin. [bbe] And he will give Israel up because of the sins which Jeroboam has done and made Israel do. 14:17 [hgb] 耶 罗 波 安 的 妻 起 身 回 去 ， 到 了 得 撒 ， 刚 到 门 槛 ， 儿 子 就 死 了 。 [kjv] And Jeroboam\u0027s wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died; [bbe] Then Jeroboam\u0027s wife got up and went away and came to Tirzah; and when she came to the doorway of the house, death came to the child. 14:18 [hgb] 以 色 列 众 人 将 他 葬 埋 ， 为 他 哀 哭 ， 正 如 耶 和 华 借 他 仆 人 先 知 亚 希 雅 所 说 的 话 。 [kjv] And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet. [bbe] And all Israel put his body to rest, weeping over him, as the Lord had said by his servant Ahijah the prophet. 14:19 [hgb] 耶 罗 波 安 其 余 的 事 ， 他 怎 样 争 战 ， 怎 样 作 王 ， 都 写 在 以 色 列 诸 王 记 上 。 [kjv] And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. [bbe] Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he made war and how he became king, are recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel. 14:20 [hgb] 耶 罗 波 安 作 王 二 十 二 年 ， 就 与 他 列 祖 同 睡 。 他 儿 子 拿 答 接 续 他 作 王 。 [kjv] And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead. [bbe] And Jeroboam was king for twenty-two years, and was put to rest with his fathers, and Nadab his son became king in his place. 14:21 [hgb] 所 罗 门 的 儿 子 罗 波 安 作 犹 大 王 。 他 登 基 的 时 候 年 四 十 一 岁 ， 在 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 就 是 耶 和 华 从 以 色 列 众 支 派 中 所 选 择 立 他 名 的 城 ， 作 王 十 七 年 。 罗 波 安 的 母 亲 名 叫 拿 玛 ， 是 亚 扪 人 。 [kjv] And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother\u0027s name was Naamah an Ammonitess. [bbe] And Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, was king in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king, and he was king for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the town which the Lord had made his out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there; his mother\u0027s name was Naamah, an Ammonite woman. 14:22 [hgb] 犹 大 人 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 事 ， 犯 罪 触 动 他 的 愤 恨 ， 比 他 们 列 祖 更 甚 。 [kjv] And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done. [bbe] And Judah did evil in the eyes of the Lord, and made him more angry than their fathers had done by their sins. 14:23 [hgb] 因 为 他 们 在 各 高 冈 上 ， 各 青 翠 树 下 筑 坛 ， 立 柱 像 和 木 偶 。 [kjv] For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree. [bbe] For they made high places and upright stones and wood pillars on every high hill and under every green tree; 14:24 [hgb] 国 中 也 有 娈 童 。 犹 大 人 效 法 耶 和 华 在 以 色 列 人 面 前 所 赶 出 的 外 邦 人 ， 行 一 切 可 憎 恶 的 事 。 [kjv] And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel. [bbe] And more than this, there were those in the land who were used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods, doing the same disgusting crimes as the nations which the Lord had sent out before the children of Israel. 14:25 [hgb] 罗 波 安 王 第 五 年 ， 埃 及 王 示 撒 上 来 攻 取 耶 路 撒 冷 ， [kjv] And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem: [bbe] Now in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak, king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem; 14:26 [hgb] 夺 了 耶 和 华 殿 和 王 宫 里 的 宝 物 ， 尽 都 带 走 ， 又 夺 去 所 罗 门 制 造 的 金 盾 牌 。 [kjv] And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king\u0027s house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made. [bbe] And took away all the stored wealth from the house of the Lord, and from the king\u0027s house, and all the gold body-covers which Solomon had made. 14:27 [hgb] 罗 波 安 王 制 造 铜 盾 牌 代 替 那 金 盾 牌 ， 交 给 守 王 宫 门 的 护 卫 长 看 守 。 [kjv] And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the door of the king\u0027s house. [bbe] So in their place King Rehoboam had other body-covers made of brass, and gave them into the care of the captains of the armed men who were stationed at the door of the king\u0027s house. 14:28 [hgb] 王 每 逢 进 耶 和 华 的 殿 ， 护 卫 兵 就 拿 这 盾 牌 ， 随 后 仍 将 盾 牌 送 回 ， 放 在 护 卫 房 。 [kjv] And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD, that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard chamber. [bbe] And whenever the king went into the house of the Lord, the armed men went with him taking the body-covers, and then took them back to their room. 14:29 [hgb] 罗 波 安 其 余 的 事 ， 凡 他 所 行 的 ， 都 写 在 犹 大 列 王 记 上 。 [kjv] Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? [bbe] Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all he did, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah? 14:30 [hgb] 罗 波 安 与 耶 罗 波 安 时 常 争 战 。 [kjv] And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days. [bbe] And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days. 14:31 [hgb] 罗 波 安 与 他 列 祖 同 睡 ， 葬 在 大 卫 城 他 列 祖 的 坟 地 里 。 他 母 亲 名 叫 拿 玛 ， 是 亚 扪 人 。 他 儿 子 亚 比 央 （ 又 名 亚 比 雅 ） 接 续 他 作 王 。 [kjv] And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother\u0027s name was Naamah an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead. [bbe] And Rehoboam went to rest with his fathers, and was put into the earth with his fathers in the town of David; his mother\u0027s name was Naamah, an Ammonite woman. And Abijam his son became king in his place.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/107/1547.html","bookId":187,"book":{"id":187,"title":"Kings列王记上","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 大 卫 王 年 纪 老 迈 ， 虽 用 被 遮 盖 ， 仍 不 觉 暖 。 [kjv] Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat. ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/107","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
