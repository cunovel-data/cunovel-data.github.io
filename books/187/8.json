[bbe] Then Solomon sent for all the responsible men of Israel, and all the chiefs of the tribes, and the heads of families of the children of Israel, to come to him in Jerusalem to take the ark of the Lord\u0027s agreement up out of the town of David, which is Zion. 8:2 [hgb] 以 他 念 月 ， 就 是 七 月 ， 在 节 前 ， 以 色 列 人 都 聚 集 到 所 罗 门 王 那 里 。 [kjv] And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month. [bbe] And all the men of Israel came together to King Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, the seventh month. 8:3 [hgb] 以 色 列 长 老 来 到 ， 祭 司 便 抬 起 约 柜 ， [kjv] And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark. [bbe] And all the responsible men of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark. 8:4 [hgb] 祭 司 和 利 未 人 将 耶 和 华 的 约 柜 运 上 来 ， 又 将 会 幕 和 会 幕 的 一 切 圣 器 具 都 带 上 来 。 [kjv] And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up. [bbe] They took up the ark of the Lord, and the Tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels which were in the Tent; all these the priests and the Levites took up. 8:5 [hgb] 所 罗 门 王 和 聚 集 到 他 那 里 的 以 色 列 全 会 众 ， 一 同 在 约 柜 前 献 牛 羊 为 祭 ， 多 得 不 可 胜 数 。 [kjv] And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude. [bbe] And King Solomon and all the men of Israel who had come together there, were with him before the ark, making offerings of sheep and oxen more than might be numbered. 8:6 [hgb] 祭 司 将 耶 和 华 的 约 柜 抬 进 内 殿 ， 就 是 至 圣 所 ， 放 在 两 个 基 路 伯 的 翅 膀 底 下 。 [kjv] And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims. [bbe] And the priests took the ark of the agreement of the Lord and put it in its place in the inner room of the house, in the most holy place, under the wings of the winged ones. 8:7 [hgb] 基 路 伯 张 着 翅 膀 在 约 柜 之 上 ， 遮 掩 约 柜 和 抬 柜 的 杠 。 [kjv] For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above. [bbe] For their wings were outstretched over the place where the ark was, covering the ark and its rods. 8:8 [hgb] 这 杠 甚 长 ， 杠 头 在 内 殿 前 的 圣 所 可 以 看 见 ， 在 殿 外 却 不 能 看 见 ， 直 到 如 今 还 在 那 里 。 [kjv] And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day. [bbe] The rods were so long that their ends were seen from the holy place, in front of the inmost room; but they were not seen from outside: and there they are to this day. 8:9 [hgb] 约 柜 里 惟 有 两 块 石 版 ， 就 是 以 色 列 人 出 埃 及 地 后 ， 耶 和 华 与 他 们 立 约 的 时 候 摩 西 在 何 烈 山 所 放 的 。 除 此 以 外 ， 并 无 别 物 。 [kjv] There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt. [bbe] There was nothing in the ark but the two flat stones which Moses put there at Horeb, where the Lord made an agreement with the children of Israel when they came out of the land of Egypt. 8:10 [hgb] 祭 司 从 圣 所 出 来 的 时 候 ， 有 云 充 满 耶 和 华 的 殿 。 [kjv] And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD, [bbe] Now when the priests had come out of the holy place, the house of the Lord was full of the cloud, 8:11 [hgb] 甚 至 祭 司 不 能 站 立 供 职 ， 因 为 耶 和 华 的 荣 光 充 满 了 殿 。 [kjv] So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD. [bbe] So that the priests were not able to keep their places to do their work because of the cloud, for the house of the Lord was full of the glory of the Lord. 8:12 [hgb] 那 时 所 罗 门 说 ， 耶 和 华 曾 说 ， 他 必 住 在 幽 暗 之 处 。 [kjv] Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the thick darkness. [bbe] Then Solomon said, O Lord, to the sun you have given the heaven for a living-place, but your living-place was not seen by men; 8:13 [hgb] 我 已 经 建 造 殿 宇 作 你 的 居 所 ， 为 你 永 远 的 住 处 。 [kjv] I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever. [bbe] So I have made for you a living-place, a house in which you may be for ever present. 8:14 [hgb] 王 转 脸 为 以 色 列 会 众 祝 福 ， 以 色 列 会 众 就 都 站 立 。 [kjv] And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;) [bbe] Then, turning his face about, the king gave a blessing to all the men of Israel; and they were all on their feet together. 8:15 [hgb] 所 罗 门 说 ， 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 是 应 当 称 颂 的 。 因 他 亲 口 向 我 父 大 卫 所 应 许 的 ， 也 亲 手 成 就 了 。 [kjv] And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying, [bbe] And he said, Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, who himself gave his word to David my father, and with his strong hand has made his word come true, saying, 8:16 [hgb] 他 说 ， 自 从 我 领 我 民 以 色 列 出 埃 及 以 来 ， 我 未 曾 在 以 色 列 各 支 派 中 选 择 一 城 建 造 殿 宇 为 我 名 的 居 所 ， 但 拣 选 大 卫 治 理 我 民 以 色 列 。 [kjv] Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel. [bbe] From the day when I took my people Israel out of Egypt, no town in all the tribes of Israel has been marked out by me for the building of a house for the resting-place of my name; but I made selection of David to be king over my people Israel. 8:17 [hgb] 所 罗 门 说 ， 我 父 大 卫 曾 立 意 ， 要 为 耶 和 华 以 色 列 神 的 名 建 殿 。 [kjv] And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel. [bbe] Now it was in the heart of David my father to put up a house for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel. 8:18 [hgb] 耶 和 华 却 对 我 父 大 卫 说 ， 你 立 意 为 我 的 名 建 殿 ， 这 意 思 甚 好 。 [kjv] And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart. [bbe] But the Lord said to David my father, You did well to have in your heart the desire to make a house for my name; 8:19 [hgb] 只 是 你 不 可 建 殿 ， 惟 你 所 生 的 儿 子 必 为 我 名 建 殿 。 [kjv] Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name. [bbe] But you yourself will not be the builder of my house; but your son, the offspring of your body, he it is who will put up a house for my name. 8:20 [hgb] 现 在 耶 和 华 成 就 了 他 所 应 许 的 话 ， 使 我 接 续 我 父 大 卫 坐 以 色 列 的 国 位 ， 又 为 耶 和 华 以 色 列 神 的 名 建 造 了 殿 。 [kjv] And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel. [bbe] And the Lord has made his word come true; for I have taken my father David\u0027s place on the seat of the kingdom of Israel, as the Lord gave his word; and I have made a house for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel. 8:21 [hgb] 我 也 在 其 中 为 约 柜 预 备 一 处 。 约 柜 内 有 耶 和 华 的 约 ， 就 是 他 领 我 们 列 祖 出 埃 及 地 的 时 候 ， 与 他 们 所 立 的 约 。 [kjv] And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt. [bbe] In it I have made a place for the ark, in which is the agreement which the Lord made with our fathers, when he took them out of the land of Egypt. 8:22 [hgb] 所 罗 门 当 着 以 色 列 会 众 ， 站 在 耶 和 华 的 坛 前 ， 向 天 举 手 说 ， [kjv] And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven: [bbe] Then Solomon took his place before the altar of the Lord, all the men of Israel being present, and stretching out his hands to heaven, 8:23 [hgb] 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 阿 ， 天 上 地 下 没 有 神 可 比 你 的 。 你 向 那 尽 心 行 在 你 面 前 的 仆 人 守 约 施 慈 爱 。 [kjv] And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart: [bbe] Said, O Lord, the God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven or on the earth; keeping faith and mercy unchanging for your servants, while they go in your ways with all their hearts. 8:24 [hgb] 向 你 仆 人 我 父 大 卫 所 应 许 的 话 现 在 应 验 了 。 你 亲 口 应 许 ， 亲 手 成 就 ， 正 如 今 日 一 样 。 [kjv] Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day. [bbe] And you have kept the word which you gave to your servant David, my father; with your mouth you said it and with your hand you have made it come true this day. 8:25 [hgb] 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 阿 ， 你 所 应 许 你 仆 人 我 父 大 卫 的 话 说 ， 你 的 子 孙 若 谨 慎 自 己 的 行 为 ， 在 我 面 前 行 事 象 你 所 行 的 一 样 ， 就 不 断 人 坐 以 色 列 的 国 位 。 现 在 求 你 应 验 这 话 。 [kjv] Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me. [bbe] So now, O Lord, the God of Israel, let your word to your servant David, my father, come true, when you said, You will never be without a man to take his place on the seat of the kingdom of Israel before me, if only your children give attention to their ways, walking before me as you have done. 8:26 [hgb] 以 色 列 的 神 阿 ， 求 你 成 就 向 你 仆 人 我 父 大 卫 所 应 许 的 话 。 [kjv] And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father. [bbe] So now, O God of Israel, it is my prayer that you will make your word come true which you said to your servant David, my father. 8:27 [hgb] 神 果 真 住 在 地 上 吗 ？ 看 哪 ， 天 和 天 上 的 天 尚 且 不 足 你 居 住 的 ， 何 况 我 所 建 的 这 殿 呢 ？ [kjv] But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded? [bbe] But is it truly possible that God may be housed on earth? see, heaven and the heaven of heavens are not wide enough to be your resting-place; how much less this house which I have made! 8:28 [hgb] 惟 求 耶 和 华 我 的 神 垂 顾 仆 人 的 祷 告 祈 求 ， 俯 听 仆 人 今 日 在 你 面 前 的 祈 祷 呼 吁 。 [kjv] Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day: [bbe] Still, let your heart be turned to the prayer of your servant, O Lord God, and to his prayer for grace; give ear to the cry and the prayer which your servant sends up to you this day; 8:29 [hgb] 愿 你 昼 夜 看 顾 这 殿 ， 就 是 你 应 许 立 为 你 名 的 居 所 。 求 你 垂 听 仆 人 向 此 处 祷 告 的 话 。 [kjv] That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place. [bbe] That your eyes may be open to this house night and day, to this place of which you have said, My name will be there; hearing the prayer which your servant may make, turning to this place. 8:30 [hgb] 你 仆 人 和 你 民 以 色 列 向 此 处 祈 祷 的 时 候 ， 求 你 在 天 上 你 的 居 所 垂 听 ， 垂 听 而 赦 免 。 [kjv] And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive. [bbe] Give ear to the prayers of your servant, and the prayers of your people Israel, when they make their prayers, turning to this place; give ear in heaven your living-place, and hearing, have mercy. 8:31 [hgb] 人 若 得 罪 邻 舍 ， 有 人 叫 他 起 誓 ， 他 来 到 这 殿 在 你 的 坛 前 起 誓 ， [kjv] If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house: [bbe] If a man does wrong to his neighbour, and has to take an oath, and comes before your altar to take his oath in this house: 8:32 [hgb] 求 你 在 天 上 垂 听 ， 判 断 你 的 仆 人 ， 定 恶 人 有 罪 ， 照 他 所 行 的 报 应 在 他 头 上 。 定 义 人 有 理 ， 照 他 的 义 赏 赐 他 。 [kjv] Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness. [bbe] Then let your ear be open in heaven, and be the judge of your servants, giving your decision against the wrongdoer, so that punishment for his sins may come on his head; and, by your decision, keeping from evil him who has done no wrong. 8:33 [hgb] 你 的 民 以 色 列 若 得 罪 你 ， 败 在 仇 敌 面 前 ， 又 归 向 你 ， 承 认 你 的 名 ， 在 这 殿 里 祈 求 祷 告 ， [kjv] When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house: [bbe] When your people Israel are overcome in war, because of their sin against you; if they are turned to you again, honouring your name, making prayers to you and requesting your grace in this house: 8:34 [hgb] 求 你 在 天 上 垂 听 ， 赦 免 你 民 以 色 列 的 罪 ， 使 他 们 归 回 你 赐 给 他 们 列 祖 之 地 。 [kjv] Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers. [bbe] Then give ear in heaven, and let the sin of your people Israel have forgiveness, and take them back again into the land which you gave to their fathers. 8:35 [hgb] 你 的 民 因 得 罪 你 ， 你 惩 罚 他 们 ， 使 天 闭 塞 不 下 雨 。 他 们 若 向 此 处 祷 告 ， 承 认 你 的 名 ， 离 开 他 们 的 罪 ， [kjv] When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them: [bbe] When heaven is shut up and there is no rain, because of their sin against you; if they make prayers with their faces turned to this place, honouring your name and turning away from their sin when you send trouble on them: 8:36 [hgb] 求 你 在 天 上 垂 听 ， 赦 免 你 仆 人 以 色 列 民 的 罪 ， 将 当 行 的 善 道 指 教 他 们 ， 且 降 雨 在 你 的 地 ， 就 是 你 赐 给 你 民 为 业 之 地 。 [kjv] Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance. [bbe] Then give ear in heaven, so that the sin of your servants, and of your people Israel, may have forgiveness, when you make clear to them the good way in which they are to go; and send rain on your land which you have given to your people for their heritage. 8:37 [hgb] 国 中 若 有 饥 荒 ， 瘟 疫 ， 旱 风 ， 霉 烂 ， 蝗 虫 ， 蚂 蚱 ， 或 有 仇 敌 犯 境 围 困 城 邑 ， 无 论 遭 遇 什 么 灾 祸 疾 病 ， [kjv] If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be; [bbe] If there is no food in the land, or if there is disease, or if the fruits of the earth are damaged through heat or water, locust or worm; if their towns are shut in by their attackers; whatever trouble, whatever disease there may be: 8:38 [hgb] 你 的 民 以 色 列 ， 或 是 众 人 ， 或 是 一 人 ， 自 觉 有 罪 （ 原 文 作 灾 ） ， 向 这 殿 举 手 ， 无 论 祈 求 什 么 ， 祷 告 什 么 ， [kjv] What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house: [bbe] Whatever prayer or request for your grace is made by any man, or by all your people Israel, whatever his trouble may be, whose hands are stretched out to this house: 8:39 [hgb] 求 你 在 天 上 你 的 居 所 垂 听 赦 免 。 你 是 知 道 人 心 的 ， 要 照 各 人 所 行 的 待 他 们 ， （ 惟 有 你 知 道 世 人 的 心 ） ， [kjv] Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;) [bbe] Give ear in heaven your living-place, acting in mercy; and give to every man whose secret heart is open to you, the reward of all his ways; for you, and you only, have knowledge of the hearts of all the children of men: 8:40 [hgb] 使 他 们 在 你 赐 给 我 们 列 祖 之 地 上 一 生 一 世 敬 畏 你 。 [kjv] That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers. [bbe] So that they may give you worship all the days of their life in the land which you gave to our fathers. 8:41 [hgb] 论 到 不 属 你 民 以 色 列 的 外 邦 人 ， 为 你 名 从 远 方 而 来 ， [kjv] Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name\u0027s sake; [bbe] And as for the man from a strange land, who is not of your people Israel; when he comes from a far country because of the glory of your name: 8:42 [hgb] （ 他 们 听 人 论 说 你 的 大 名 和 大 能 的 手 ， 并 伸 出 来 的 膀 臂 ） 向 这 殿 祷 告 ， [kjv] (For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house; [bbe] (For they will have news of your great name and your strong hand and your out-stretched arm;) when he comes to make his prayer, turning to this house: 8:43 [hgb] 求 你 在 天 上 你 的 居 所 垂 听 ， 照 着 外 邦 人 所 祈 求 的 而 行 ， 使 天 下 万 民 都 认 识 你 的 名 ， 敬 畏 你 象 你 的 民 以 色 列 一 样 。 又 使 他 们 知 道 我 建 造 的 这 殿 是 称 为 你 名 下 的 。 [kjv] Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy name. [bbe] Give ear in heaven your living-place, and give him his desire, whatever it may be; so that all the peoples of the earth may have knowledge of your name, worshipping you as do your people Israel, and that they may see that this house which I have put up is truly named by your name. 8:44 [hgb] 你 的 民 若 奉 你 的 差 遣 ， 无 论 往 何 处 去 与 仇 敌 争 战 ， 向 耶 和 华 所 选 择 的 城 与 我 为 你 名 所 建 造 的 殿 祷 告 ， [kjv] If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house that I have built for thy name: [bbe] If your people go out to war against their attackers, by whatever way you may send them, if they make their prayer to the Lord, turning their faces to this town of yours and to this house which I have made for your name: 8:45 [hgb] 求 你 在 天 上 垂 听 他 们 的 祷 告 祈 求 ， 使 他 们 得 胜 。 [kjv] Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. [bbe] Give ear in heaven to their prayer and their cry for grace, and see right done to them. 8:46 [hgb] 你 的 民 若 得 罪 你 （ 世 上 没 有 不 犯 罪 的 人 ） ， 你 向 他 们 发 怒 ， 将 他 们 交 给 仇 敌 掳 到 仇 敌 之 地 ， 或 远 或 近 ， [kjv] If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near; [bbe] If they do wrong against you, (for no man is without sin,) and you are angry with them and give them up into the power of those who are fighting against them, so that they take them away as prisoners into a strange land, far off or near; 8:47 [hgb] 他 们 若 在 掳 到 之 地 想 起 罪 来 ， 回 心 转 意 ， 恳 求 你 说 ， 我 们 有 罪 了 ， 我 们 悖 逆 了 ， 我 们 作 恶 了 。 [kjv] Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness; [bbe] And if they take thought, in the land where they are prisoners, and are turned again to you, crying out in prayer to you in that land, and saying, We are sinners, we have done wrong, we have done evil; 8:48 [hgb] 他 们 若 在 掳 到 之 地 尽 心 尽 性 归 服 你 ， 又 向 自 己 的 地 ， 就 是 你 赐 给 他 们 列 祖 之 地 和 你 所 选 择 的 城 ， 并 我 为 你 名 所 建 造 的 殿 祷 告 ， [kjv] And so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name: [bbe] And with all their heart and soul are turned again to you, in the land of those who took them prisoners, and make their prayer to you, turning their eyes to this land which you gave to their fathers, and to the town which you took for yourself, and the house which I made for your name: 8:49 [hgb] 求 你 在 天 上 你 的 居 所 垂 听 他 们 的 祷 告 祈 求 ， 为 他 们 伸 冤 。 [kjv] Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause, [bbe] Then give ear to their prayer and to their cry in heaven your living-place, and see right done to them; 8:50 [hgb] 饶 恕 得 罪 你 的 民 ， 赦 免 他 们 的 一 切 过 犯 ， 使 他 们 在 掳 他 们 的 人 面 前 蒙 怜 恤 。 [kjv] And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them: [bbe] Answering with forgiveness the people who have done wrong against you, and overlooking the evil which they have done against you; let those who made them prisoners be moved with pity for them, and have pity on them; 8:51 [hgb] 因 为 他 们 是 你 的 子 民 ， 你 的 产 业 ， 是 你 从 埃 及 领 出 来 脱 离 铁 炉 的 。 [kjv] For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron: [bbe] For they are your people and your heritage, which you took out of Egypt, out of the iron fireplace; 8:52 [hgb] 愿 你 的 眼 目 看 顾 仆 人 ， 听 你 民 以 色 列 的 祈 求 ， 无 论 何 时 向 你 祈 求 ， 愿 你 垂 听 。 [kjv] That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee. [bbe] Let your eyes be open to your servant\u0027s prayer for grace and to the prayer of your people Israel, hearing them when their cry comes to you. 8:53 [hgb] 主 耶 和 华 阿 ， 你 将 他 们 从 地 上 的 万 民 中 分 别 出 来 作 你 的 产 业 ， 是 照 你 领 我 们 列 祖 出 埃 及 的 时 候 ， 借 你 仆 人 摩 西 所 应 许 的 话 。 [kjv] For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O LORD God. [bbe] For you made them separate from all the peoples of the earth, to be your heritage, as you said by Moses your servant, when you took our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord God. 8:54 [hgb] 所 罗 门 在 耶 和 华 的 坛 前 屈 膝 跪 着 ， 向 天 举 手 ， 在 耶 和 华 面 前 祷 告 祈 求 已 毕 ， 就 起 来 ， [kjv] And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven. [bbe] Then Solomon, after making all these prayers and requests for grace to the Lord, got up from his knees before the altar of the Lord, where his hands had been stretched out in prayer to heaven; 8:55 [hgb] 站 着 ， 大 声 为 以 色 列 全 会 众 祝 福 ， 说 ， [kjv] And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying, [bbe] And, getting on his feet, he gave a blessing to all the men of Israel, saying with a loud voice, 8:56 [hgb] 耶 和 华 是 应 当 称 颂 的 。 因 为 他 照 着 一 切 所 应 许 的 赐 平 安 给 他 的 民 以 色 列 人 ， 凡 借 他 仆 人 摩 西 应 许 赐 福 的 话 ， 一 句 都 没 有 落 空 。 [kjv] Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant. [bbe] Praise be to the Lord who has given rest to his people Israel, as he gave them his word to do; every word of all his oath, which he gave by the hand of Moses his servant, has come true. 8:57 [hgb] 愿 耶 和 华 我 们 的 神 与 我 们 同 在 ， 像 与 我 们 列 祖 同 在 一 样 ， 不 撇 下 我 们 ， 不 丢 弃 我 们 ， [kjv] The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us: [bbe] Now may the Lord our God be with us as he was with our fathers; let him never go away from us or give us up; 8:58 [hgb] 使 我 们 的 心 归 向 他 ， 遵 行 他 的 道 ， 谨 守 他 吩 咐 我 们 列 祖 的 诫 命 ， 律 例 ， 典 章 。 [kjv] That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers. [bbe] Turning our hearts to himself, guiding us to go in all his ways, to keep his orders and his laws and his decisions, which he gave to our fathers. 8:59 [hgb] 我 在 耶 和 华 面 前 祈 求 的 这 些 话 ， 愿 耶 和 华 我 们 的 神 昼 夜 垂 念 ， 每 日 为 他 仆 人 与 他 民 以 色 列 伸 冤 ， [kjv] And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require: [bbe] And may these my words, the words of my prayer to the Lord, be before the Lord our God day and night, so that he may see right done to his servant and to his people Israel, day by day as we have need. 8:60 [hgb] 使 地 上 的 万 民 都 知 道 惟 独 耶 和 华 是 神 ， 并 无 别 神 。 [kjv] That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is God, and that there is none else. [bbe] So that all the peoples of the earth may see that the Lord is God, and there is no other. 8:61 [hgb] 所 以 你 们 当 向 耶 和 华 我 们 的 神 存 诚 实 的 心 ， 遵 行 他 的 律 例 ， 谨 守 他 的 诫 命 ， 至 终 如 今 日 一 样 。 [kjv] Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day. [bbe] Then let your hearts be without sin before the Lord our God, walking in his laws and keeping his orders as at this day. 8:62 [hgb] 王 和 以 色 列 众 民 一 同 在 耶 和 华 面 前 献 祭 。 [kjv] And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD. [bbe] Now the king, and all Israel with him, were making offerings before the Lord. 8:63 [hgb] 所 罗 门 向 耶 和 华 献 平 安 祭 ， 用 牛 二 万 二 千 ， 羊 十 二 万 。 这 样 ， 王 和 以 色 列 众 民 为 耶 和 华 的 殿 行 奉 献 之 礼 。 [kjv] And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD. [bbe] And Solomon gave to the Lord for peace-offerings, twenty-two thousand oxen and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel kept the feast of the opening of the Lord\u0027s house. 8:64 [hgb] 当 日 ， 王 因 耶 和 华 殿 前 的 铜 坛 太 小 ， 容 不 下 燔 祭 ， 素 祭 ， 和 平 安 祭 牲 的 脂 油 ， 便 将 耶 和 华 殿 前 院 子 当 中 分 别 为 圣 ， 在 那 里 献 燔 祭 ， 素 祭 ， 和 平 安 祭 牲 的 脂 油 。 [kjv] The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brasen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings. [bbe] The same day the king made holy the middle of the open square in front of the house of the Lord, offering there the burned offering and the meal offering and the fat of the peace-offerings; for there was not room on the brass altar of the Lord for the burned offerings and the meal offerings and the fat of the peace-offerings. 8:65 [hgb] 那 时 ， 所 罗 门 和 以 色 列 众 人 ， 就 是 从 哈 马 口 直 到 埃 及 小 河 所 有 的 以 色 列 人 ， 都 聚 集 成 为 大 会 ， 在 耶 和 华 我 们 的 神 面 前 守 节 七 日 又 七 日 ， 共 十 四 日 。 [kjv] And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days. [bbe] So Solomon and all Israel with him, a very great meeting, (for the people had come together from the way into Hamath to the river of Egypt,) kept the feast at that time before the Lord our God, for two weeks, even fourteen days. 8:66 [hgb] 第 八 日 ， 王 遣 散 众 民 。 他 们 都 为 王 祝 福 。 因 见 耶 和 华 向 他 仆 人 大 卫 和 他 民 以 色 列 所 施 的 一 切 恩 惠 ， 就 都 心 中 喜 乐 ， 各 归 各 家 去 了 。 [kjv] On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people. [bbe] And on the eighth day he sent the people away, and, blessing the king, they went to their tents full of joy and glad in their hearts, because of all the good which the Lord had done to David his servant and to Israel his people.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/107/1541.html","bookId":187,"book":{"id":187,"title":"Kings列王记上","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 大 卫 王 年 纪 老 迈 ， 虽 用 被 遮 盖 ， 仍 不 觉 暖 。 [kjv] Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat. ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/107","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
