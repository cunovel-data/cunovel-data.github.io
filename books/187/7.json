Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh\u0027s daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch. \\n\\n [bbe] And the house for his living-place, the other open square in the covered room, was made in the same way. And then he made a house like it for Pharaoh\u0027s daughter, whom Solomon had taken as his wife. \\n\\n 7:9 [hgb] 建 造 这 一 切 所 用 的 石 头 都 是 宝 贵 的 ， 是 按 着 尺 寸 凿 成 的 ， 是 用 锯 里 外 锯 齐 的 。 从 根 基 直 到 檐 石 ， 从 外 头 直 到 大 院 ， 都 是 如 此 。 \\n\\n [kjv] All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court. \\n\\n [bbe] All these buildings were made, inside and out, from base to crowning stone, and outside to the great walled square, of highly priced stone, cut to different sizes with cutting-instruments. \\n\\n 7:10 [hgb] 根 基 是 宝 贵 的 大 石 头 ， 有 长 十 肘 的 ， 有 长 八 肘 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits. \\n\\n [bbe] And the base was of great masses of highly priced stone, some ten cubits and some eight cubits square. \\n\\n 7:11 [hgb] 上 面 有 香 柏 木 和 按 着 尺 寸 凿 成 宝 贵 的 石 头 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars. \\n\\n [bbe] Overhead were highly priced stones cut to measure, and cedar-wood. \\n\\n 7:12 [hgb] 大 院 周 围 有 凿 成 的 石 头 三 层 ， 香 柏 木 一 层 ， 都 照 耶 和 华 殿 的 内 院 和 殿 廊 的 样 式 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house. \\n\\n [bbe] The great outer square all round was walled with three lines of squared stones and a line of cedar-wood boards, round about the open square inside the house of the Lord and the covered room of the king\u0027s house. \\n\\n 7:13 [hgb] 所 罗 门 王 差 遣 人 往 推 罗 去 ， 将 户 兰 召 了 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre. \\n\\n [bbe] Then King Solomon sent and got Hiram from Tyre. \\n\\n 7:14 [hgb] 他 是 拿 弗 他 利 支 派 中 一 个 寡 妇 的 儿 子 ， 他 父 亲 是 推 罗 人 ， 作 铜 匠 的 。 户 兰 满 有 智 慧 ， 聪 明 ， 技 能 ， 善 于 各 样 铜 作 。 他 来 到 所 罗 门 王 那 里 ， 作 王 一 切 所 要 作 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He was a widow\u0027s son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work. \\n\\n [bbe] He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; he was full of wisdom and knowledge and an expert worker in brass. He came to King Solomon and did all his work for him. \\n\\n 7:15 [hgb] 他 制 造 两 根 铜 柱 ， 每 根 高 十 八 肘 ， 围 十 二 肘 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about. \\n\\n [bbe] He it was who made the two brass pillars; the first pillar was eighteen cubits high, and a line of twelve cubits went round it; and the second was the same. \\n\\n 7:16 [hgb] 又 用 铜 铸 了 两 个 柱 顶 安 在 柱 上 ， 各 高 五 肘 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits: \\n\\n [bbe] And he made the two crowns to be put on the tops of the pillars, of brass made soft in the fire; the crowns were five cubits high. \\n\\n 7:17 [hgb] 柱 顶 上 有 装 修 的 网 子 和 拧 成 的 链 索 ， 每 顶 七 个 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter. \\n\\n [bbe] There were nets of open-work for the crowns on the tops of the pillars, a net of open-work for one and a net of open-work for the other. \\n\\n 7:18 [hgb] 网 子 周 围 有 两 行 石 榴 遮 盖 柱 顶 ， 两 个 柱 顶 都 是 如 此 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter. \\n\\n [bbe] And he made ornaments of apples; and two lines of apples all round over the network, covering the crowns of the pillars, the two crowns in the same way. \\n\\n 7:19 [hgb] 廊 子 的 柱 顶 径 四 肘 ， 刻 着 百 合 花 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch, four cubits. \\n\\n [bbe] The crowns on the tops of the pillars were ornamented with a design of flowers, and were four cubits across. \\n\\n 7:20 [hgb] 两 柱 顶 的 鼓 肚 上 挨 着 网 子 ， 各 有 两 行 石 榴 环 绕 ， 两 行 共 有 二 百 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter. \\n\\n [bbe] And there were crowns on the two pillars near the round part by the network, and there were two hundred apples in lines round every crown. \\n\\n 7:21 [hgb] 他 将 两 根 柱 子 立 在 殿 廊 前 头 ， 右 边 立 一 根 ， 起 名 叫 雅 斤 。 左 边 立 一 根 ， 起 名 叫 波 阿 斯 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz. \\n\\n [bbe] He put up the pillars at the doorway of the Temple, naming the one on the right Jachin, and that on the left Boaz. \\n\\n 7:22 [hgb] 在 柱 顶 上 刻 着 百 合 花 。 这 样 ， 造 柱 子 的 工 就 完 毕 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished. \\n\\n [bbe] The tops of the pillars had a design of flowers; and the work of making the pillars was complete. \\n\\n 7:23 [hgb] 他 又 铸 一 个 铜 海 ， 样 式 是 圆 的 ， 高 五 肘 ， 径 十 肘 ， 围 三 十 肘 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about. \\n\\n [bbe] And he made a great metal water-vessel ten cubits across from edge to edge, five cubits high and thirty cubits round. \\n\\n 7:24 [hgb] 在 海 边 之 下 ， 周 围 有 野 瓜 的 样 式 。 每 肘 十 瓜 ， 共 有 两 行 ， 是 铸 海 的 时 候 铸 上 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast. \\n\\n [bbe] And under the edge of it, circling it all round for ten cubits, were two lines of flower buds, made together with it from liquid metal. \\n\\n 7:25 [hgb] 有 十 二 只 铜 牛 驮 海 ， 三 只 向 北 ， 三 只 向 西 ， 三 只 向 南 ， 三 只 向 东 。 海 在 牛 上 ， 牛 尾 都 向 内 。 \\n\\n [kjv] It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward. \\n\\n [bbe] It was supported on twelve oxen, with their back parts turned to the middle of it, three of them facing to the north, three to the west, three to the south, and three to the east; the vessel was resting on top of them. \\n\\n 7:26 [hgb] 海 厚 一 掌 ， 边 如 杯 边 ， 又 如 百 合 花 ， 可 容 二 千 吧 特 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths. \\n\\n [bbe] It was as thick as a man\u0027s open hand, and was curved like the edge of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it would take two thousand baths. \\n\\n 7:27 [hgb] 他 用 铜 制 造 十 个 盆 座 ， 每 座 长 四 肘 ， 宽 四 肘 ， 高 三 肘 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it. \\n\\n [bbe] And he made ten wheeled bases of brass; every one four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high. \\n\\n 7:28 [hgb] 座 的 造 法 是 这 样 ， 四 面 都 有 心 子 ， 心 子 在 边 子 当 中 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges: \\n\\n [bbe] And the bases were made in this way; their sides were square, fixed in a framework; \\n\\n 7:29 [hgb] 心 子 上 有 狮 子 和 牛 ， 并 基 路 伯 。 边 上 有 小 座 ， 狮 子 和 牛 以 下 有 垂 下 的 璎 珞 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work. \\n\\n [bbe] And on the square sides between the frames were lions, oxen, and winged ones; and the same on the frame; and over and under the lions and the oxen and the winged ones were steps. \\n\\n 7:30 [hgb] 每 盆 座 有 四 个 铜 轮 和 铜 轴 。 小 座 的 四 角 上 在 盆 以 下 ， 有 铸 成 的 盆 架 ， 其 旁 都 有 璎 珞 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition. \\n\\n [bbe] Every base had four wheels of brass, turning on brass rods, and their four angles had angle-plates under them; the angle-plates under the base were of metal, and there were ornaments at the side of every one. \\n\\n 7:31 [hgb] 小 座 高 一 肘 ， 口 是 圆 的 ， 仿 佛 座 的 样 式 ， 径 一 肘 半 ， 在 口 上 有 雕 工 ， 心 子 是 方 的 ， 不 是 圆 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round. \\n\\n [bbe] The mouth of it inside the angle-plate was one cubit across; it was round like a pillar, a cubit and a half across; it had designs cut on it; the sides were square, not round. \\n\\n 7:32 [hgb] 四 个 轮 子 在 心 子 以 下 ， 轮 轴 与 座 相 连 ， 每 轮 高 一 肘 半 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit. \\n\\n [bbe] The four wheels were under the frames, and the rods on which the wheels were fixed were in the base; the wheels were a cubit and a half high. \\n\\n 7:33 [hgb] 轮 的 样 式 如 同 车 轮 。 轴 ， 辋 ， 辐 ， 毂 都 是 铸 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, were all molten. \\n\\n [bbe] The wheels were made like carriage-wheels, the rods on which they were fixed, the parts forming their edges, their rods and the middle points of them, were all formed out of liquid metal. \\n\\n 7:34 [hgb] 每 座 四 角 上 都 有 盆 架 ， 是 与 座 一 同 铸 成 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself. \\n\\n [bbe] And there were four angle-plates at the four angles of every base, forming part of the structure of the base. \\n\\n 7:35 [hgb] 座 上 有 圆 架 ， 高 半 肘 。 座 上 有 撑 子 和 心 子 ， 是 与 座 一 同 铸 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same. \\n\\n [bbe] And at the top of the base there was a round vessel, half a cubit high; \\n\\n 7:36 [hgb] 在 撑 子 和 心 子 上 刻 着 基 路 伯 ， 狮 子 ， 和 棕 树 ， 周 围 有 璎 珞 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about. \\n\\n [bbe] In the spaces of the flat sides and on the frames of them, he made designs of winged ones, lions, and palm-trees, with ornamented edges all round. \\n\\n 7:37 [hgb] 十 个 盆 座 都 是 这 样 ， 铸 法 ， 尺 寸 ， 样 式 相 同 。 \\n\\n [kjv] After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size. \\n\\n [bbe] All the ten bases were made in this way, after the same design, of the same size and form. \\n\\n 7:38 [hgb] 又 用 铜 制 造 十 个 盆 ， 每 盆 可 容 四 十 吧 特 。 盆 径 四 肘 ， 在 那 十 座 上 ， 每 座 安 设 一 盆 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one laver. \\n\\n [bbe] And he made ten brass washing-vessels, everyone taking forty baths, and measuring four cubits; one vessel was placed on every one of the ten bases. \\n\\n 7:39 [hgb] 五 个 安 在 殿 门 的 右 边 ， 五 个 放 在 殿 门 的 左 边 。 又 将 海 放 在 殿 门 的 右 旁 ， 就 是 南 边 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south. \\n\\n [bbe] And he put the bases by the house, five on the right side and five on the left; and he put the great water-vessel on the right side of the house, to the east, facing south. \\n\\n 7:40 [hgb] 户 兰 又 造 了 盆 ， 铲 子 ， 和 盘 子 。 这 样 ， 他 为 所 罗 门 王 作 完 了 耶 和 华 殿 的 一 切 工 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD: \\n\\n [bbe] And Hiram made the pots and spades and the basins. So Hiram came to the end of all the work he did for King Solomon in the house of the Lord: \\n\\n 7:41 [hgb] 所 造 的 就 是 ， 两 根 柱 子 和 柱 上 两 个 如 球 的 顶 。 并 两 个 盖 柱 顶 的 网 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; \\n\\n [bbe] The two pillars and the two cups of the crowns which were on the tops of the two pillars; and the network covering the two cups of the crowns on the tops of the pillars, \\n\\n 7:42 [hgb] 和 四 百 石 榴 ， 安 在 两 个 网 子 上 ， 每 网 两 行 ， 盖 着 两 个 柱 上 如 球 的 顶 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars; \\n\\n [bbe] And the four hundred apples for the network, two lines of apples for every network, covering the two cups of the crowns on the pillars; \\n\\n 7:43 [hgb] 十 个 座 和 其 上 的 十 个 盆 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases; \\n\\n [bbe] And the ten bases, with the ten washing-vessels on them; \\n\\n 7:44 [hgb] 海 和 海 下 的 十 二 只 牛 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea; \\n\\n [bbe] And the great water-vessel, with the twelve oxen under it; \\n\\n 7:45 [hgb] 盆 ， 铲 子 ， 盘 子 。 这 一 切 都 是 户 兰 给 所 罗 门 王 用 光 亮 的 铜 为 耶 和 华 的 殿 造 成 的 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of bright brass. \\n\\n [bbe] And the pots and the spades and the basins; all the vessels which Hiram made for King Solomon, for the house of the Lord, were of polished brass. \\n\\n 7:46 [hgb] 是 遵 王 命 在 约 旦 平 原 ， 疏 割 和 撒 拉 但 中 间 借 胶 泥 铸 成 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan. \\n\\n [bbe] He made them of liquid metal in the lowland of Jordan, at the way across the river, at Adama, between Succoth and Zarethan. \\n\\n 7:47 [hgb] 这 一 切 所 罗 门 都 没 有 过 秤 。 因 为 甚 多 ， 铜 的 轻 重 也 无 法 可 查 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out. \\n\\n [bbe] The weight of all these vessels was not measured, because there was such a number of them; it was not possible to get the weight of the brass. \\n\\n 7:48 [hgb] 所 罗 门 又 造 耶 和 华 殿 里 的 金 坛 和 陈 设 饼 的 金 桌 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread was, \\n\\n [bbe] And Solomon had all the vessels made for use in the house of the Lord: the altar of gold and the gold table on which the holy bread was placed; \\n\\n 7:49 [hgb] 内 殿 前 的 精 金 灯 台 ， 右 边 五 个 ， 左 边 五 个 ， 并 其 上 的 金 花 ， 灯 盏 ， 蜡 剪 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold, \\n\\n [bbe] And the supports for the lights, five on the right side and five on the left before the inmost room, of clear gold; and the flowers and the lights and all the instruments of gold; \\n\\n 7:50 [hgb] 与 精 金 的 杯 ， 盘 ， 镊 子 ， 调 羹 ， 火 鼎 ， 以 及 至 圣 所 ， 内 殿 的 门 枢 ， 和 外 殿 的 门 枢 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple. \\n\\n [bbe] And the cups and the scissors and the basins and the spoons and the fire-trays, all of gold; and the pins on which the doors were turned, the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and the doors of the Temple, all of gold. \\n\\n 7:51 [hgb] 所 罗 门 王 作 完 了 耶 和 华 殿 的 一 切 工 ， 就 把 他 父 大 卫 分 别 为 圣 的 金 银 和 器 皿 都 带 来 放 在 耶 和 华 殿 的 府 库 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD. \\n\\n [bbe] So all the work King Solomon had done in the house of the Lord was complete. Then Solomon took the holy things which David his father had given, the silver and the gold and all the vessels, and put them in the store-houses of the house of the Lord. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/107/1540.html","bookId":187,"book":{"id":187,"title":"Kings列王记上","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 大 卫 王 年 纪 老 迈 ， 虽 用 被 遮 盖 ， 仍 不 觉 暖 。 [kjv] Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat. ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/107","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
