[bbe] Now Naboth the Jezreelite had a vine-garden in Jezreel, near the house of Ahab, king of Samaria. 21:2 [hgb] 亚 哈 对 拿 伯 说 ， 你 将 你 的 葡 萄 园 给 我 作 菜 园 ， 因 为 是 靠 近 我 的 宫 。 我 就 把 更 好 的 葡 萄 园 换 给 你 ， 或 是 你 要 银 子 ， 我 就 按 着 价 值 给 你 。 [kjv] And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money. [bbe] And Ahab said to Naboth, Give me your vine-garden so that I may have it for a garden of sweet plants, for it is near my house; and let me give you a better vine-garden in exchange, or, if it seems good to you, let me give you its value in money. 21:3 [hgb] 拿 伯 对 亚 哈 说 ， 我 敬 畏 耶 和 华 ， 万 不 敢 将 我 先 人 留 下 的 产 业 给 你 。 [kjv] And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee. [bbe] But Naboth said to Ahab, By the Lord, far be it from me to give you the heritage of my fathers. 21:4 [hgb] 亚 哈 因 耶 斯 列 人 拿 伯 说 我 不 敢 将 我 先 人 留 下 的 产 业 给 你 ， 就 闷 闷 不 乐 地 回 宫 ， 躺 在 床 上 ， 转 脸 向 内 ， 也 不 吃 饭 。 [kjv] And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread. [bbe] So Ahab came into his house bitter and angry because Naboth the Jezreelite had said to him, I will not give you the heritage of my fathers. And stretching himself on the bed with his face turned away, he would take no food. 21:5 [hgb] 王 后 耶 洗 别 来 问 他 说 ， 你 为 什 么 心 里 这 样 忧 闷 ， 不 吃 饭 呢 ？ [kjv] But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread? [bbe] But Jezebel, his wife, came to him and said, Why is your spirit so bitter that you have no desire for food? 21:6 [hgb] 他 回 答 说 ， 因 我 向 耶 斯 列 人 拿 伯 说 ， 你 将 你 的 葡 萄 园 给 我 ， 我 给 你 价 银 ， 或 是 你 愿 意 ， 我 就 把 别 的 葡 萄 园 换 给 你 。 他 却 说 ， 我 不 将 我 的 葡 萄 园 给 你 。 [kjv] And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard. [bbe] And he said to her, Because I was talking to Naboth the Jezreelite, and I said to him, Let me have your vine-garden for a price, or, if it is pleasing to you, I will give you another vine-garden for it: and he said, I will not give you my vine-garden. 21:7 [hgb] 王 后 耶 洗 别 对 亚 哈 说 ， 你 现 在 是 治 理 以 色 列 国 不 是 。 只 管 起 来 ， 心 里 畅 畅 快 快 地 吃 饭 ， 我 必 将 耶 斯 列 人 拿 伯 的 葡 萄 园 给 你 。 [kjv] And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite. [bbe] Then Jezebel, his wife, said, Are you now the ruler of Israel? Get up, take food, and let your heart be glad; I will give you the vine-garden of Naboth the Jezreelite. 21:8 [hgb] 于 是 托 亚 哈 的 名 写 信 ， 用 王 的 印 印 上 ， 送 给 那 些 与 拿 伯 同 城 居 住 的 长 老 贵 胄 。 [kjv] So she wrote letters in Ahab\u0027s name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth. [bbe] So she sent a letter in Ahab\u0027s name, stamped with his stamp, to the responsible men and the chiefs who were in authority with Naboth. 21:9 [hgb] 信 上 写 着 说 ， 你 们 当 宣 告 禁 食 ， 叫 拿 伯 坐 在 民 间 的 高 位 上 ， [kjv] And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people: [bbe] And in the letter she said, Let a time of public sorrow be fixed, and put Naboth at the head of the people; 21:10 [hgb] 又 叫 两 个 匪 徒 坐 在 拿 伯 对 面 ， 作 见 证 告 他 说 ， 你 谤 渎 神 和 王 了 。 随 后 就 把 他 拉 出 去 用 石 头 打 死 。 [kjv] And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die. [bbe] And get two good-for-nothing persons to come before him and give witness that he has been cursing God and the king. Then take him out and have him stoned to death. 21:11 [hgb] 那 些 与 拿 伯 同 城 居 住 的 长 老 贵 胄 得 了 耶 洗 别 的 信 ， 就 照 信 而 行 ， [kjv] And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them. [bbe] So the responsible men and the chiefs who were in authority in his town, did as Jezebel had said in the letter she sent them. 21:12 [hgb] 宣 告 禁 食 ， 叫 拿 伯 坐 在 民 间 的 高 位 上 。 [kjv] They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people. [bbe] They gave orders for a day of public sorrow, and put Naboth at the head of the people. 21:13 [hgb] 有 两 个 匪 徒 来 ， 坐 在 拿 伯 的 对 面 ， 当 着 众 民 作 见 证 告 他 说 ， 拿 伯 谤 渎 神 和 王 了 。 众 人 就 把 他 拉 到 城 外 ， 用 石 头 打 死 。 [kjv] And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died. [bbe] And the two good-for-nothing persons came in and took their seats before him and gave witness against Naboth, in front of the people, saying, Naboth has been cursing God and the king. Then they took him outside the town and had him stoned to death. 21:14 [hgb] 于 是 打 发 人 去 见 耶 洗 别 ， 说 ， 拿 伯 被 石 头 打 死 了 。 [kjv] Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead. [bbe] And they sent word to Jezebel, saying, Naboth has been stoned and is dead. 21:15 [hgb] 耶 洗 别 听 见 拿 伯 被 石 头 打 死 ， 就 对 亚 哈 说 ， 你 起 来 得 耶 斯 列 人 拿 伯 不 肯 为 价 银 给 你 的 葡 萄 园 吧 。 现 在 他 已 经 死 了 。 [kjv] And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead. [bbe] Then Jezebel, hearing that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, said to Ahab, Get up and take as your heritage the vine-garden of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he would not give you for money, for Naboth is no longer living but is dead. 21:16 [hgb] 亚 哈 听 见 拿 伯 死 了 ， 就 起 来 ， 下 去 要 得 耶 斯 列 人 拿 伯 的 葡 萄 园 。 [kjv] And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it. [bbe] So Ahab, hearing that Naboth was dead, went down to the vine-garden of Naboth the Jezreelite to take it as his heritage. 21:17 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 话 临 到 提 斯 比 人 以 利 亚 说 ， [kjv] And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, [bbe] And the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 21:18 [hgb] 你 起 来 ， 去 见 住 撒 玛 利 亚 的 以 色 列 王 亚 哈 ， 他 下 去 要 得 拿 伯 的 葡 萄 园 ， 现 今 正 在 那 园 里 。 [kjv] Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to possess it. [bbe] Go down to Ahab, king of Israel, in Samaria; see, he is in the vine-garden of Naboth the Jezreelite, where he has gone to take it as his heritage. 21:19 [hgb] 你 要 对 他 说 ， 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 你 杀 了 人 ， 又 得 他 的 产 业 吗 ？ 又 要 对 他 说 ， 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 狗 在 何 处 舔 拿 伯 的 血 ， 也 必 在 何 处 舔 你 的 血 。 [kjv] And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine. [bbe] Say to him, The Lord says, Have you put a man to death and taken his heritage? Then say to him, The Lord says, In the place where dogs have been drinking the blood of Naboth, there will your blood become the drink of dogs. 21:20 [hgb] 亚 哈 对 以 利 亚 说 ， 我 仇 敌 阿 ， 你 找 到 我 吗 ？ 他 回 答 说 ， 我 找 到 你 了 。 因 为 你 卖 了 自 己 ， 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 事 。 [kjv] And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD. [bbe] And Ahab said to Elijah, Have you come face to face with me, O my hater? And he said, I have come to you because you have given yourself up to do evil in the eyes of the Lord. 21:21 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 必 使 灾 祸 临 到 你 ， 将 你 除 尽 。 凡 属 你 的 男 丁 ， 无 论 困 住 的 ， 自 由 的 ， 都 从 以 色 列 中 剪 除 。 [kjv] Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, [bbe] See, I will send evil on you and put an end to you completely, cutting off from Ahab every male child, him who is shut up and him who goes free in Israel; 21:22 [hgb] 我 必 使 你 的 家 像 尼 八 的 儿 子 耶 罗 波 安 的 家 ， 又 像 亚 希 雅 的 儿 子 巴 沙 的 家 。 因 为 你 惹 我 发 怒 ， 又 使 以 色 列 人 陷 在 罪 里 。 [kjv] And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin. [bbe] And I will make your family like the family of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and like the family of Baasha, the son of Ahijah, because you have made me angry, and have made Israel do evil. 21:23 [hgb] 论 到 耶 洗 别 ， 耶 和 华 也 说 ， 狗 在 耶 斯 列 的 外 郭 必 吃 耶 洗 别 的 肉 。 [kjv] And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel. [bbe] And of Jezebel the Lord said, Jezebel will become food for dogs in the heritage of Jezreel. 21:24 [hgb] 凡 属 亚 哈 的 人 ， 死 在 城 中 的 必 被 狗 吃 ， 死 在 田 野 的 必 被 空 中 的 鸟 吃 。 [kjv] Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat. [bbe] Any man of the family of Ahab who comes to his death in the town will become food for the dogs; and he who comes to his death in the open country will be food for the birds of the air. 21:25 [hgb] （ 从 来 没 有 像 亚 哈 的 ， 因 他 自 卖 ， 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 事 ， 受 了 王 后 耶 洗 别 的 耸 动 。 [kjv] But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up. [bbe] (There was no one like Ahab, who gave himself up to do evil in the eyes of the Lord, moved to it by Jezebel his wife. 21:26 [hgb] 就 照 耶 和 华 在 以 色 列 人 面 前 所 赶 出 的 亚 摩 利 人 ， 行 了 最 可 憎 恶 的 事 ， 信 从 偶 像 。 ） [kjv] And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel. [bbe] He did a very disgusting thing in going after false gods, doing all the things the Amorites did, whom the Lord sent out before the children of Israel.) 21:27 [hgb] 亚 哈 听 见 这 话 ， 就 撕 裂 衣 服 ， 禁 食 ， 身 穿 麻 布 ， 睡 卧 也 穿 着 麻 布 ， 并 且 缓 缓 而 行 。 [kjv] And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly. [bbe] Hearing these words, Ahab, in great grief, put haircloth on his flesh and went without food, sleeping in haircloth, and going about quietly. 21:28 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 话 临 到 提 斯 比 人 以 利 亚 说 ， [kjv] And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, [bbe] Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 21:29 [hgb] 亚 哈 在 我 面 前 这 样 自 卑 ， 你 看 见 了 吗 ？ 因 他 在 我 面 前 自 卑 ， 他 还 在 世 的 时 候 ， 我 不 降 这 祸 。 到 他 儿 子 的 时 候 ， 我 必 降 这 祸 与 他 的 家 。 [kjv] Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son\u0027s days will I bring the evil upon his house. [bbe] Do you see how Ahab has made himself low before me? because he has made himself low before me, I will not send the evil in his life-time, but in his son\u0027s time I will send the evil on his family.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/107/1554.html","bookId":187,"book":{"id":187,"title":"Kings列王记上","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 大 卫 王 年 纪 老 迈 ， 虽 用 被 遮 盖 ， 仍 不 觉 暖 。 [kjv] Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat. ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/107","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
