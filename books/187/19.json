And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again. \n [bbe] And looking up, he saw by his head a cake cooked on the stones and a bottle of water. So he took food and drink and went to sleep again. \n 19:7 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 使 者 第 二 次 来 拍 他 ， 说 ， 起 来 吃 吧 。 因 为 你 当 走 的 路 甚 远 。 \n [kjv] And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee. \n [bbe] And the angel of the Lord came again a second time, and touching him said, Get up and have some food, or the journey will be overmuch for your strength. \n 19:8 [hgb] 他 就 起 来 吃 了 喝 了 ， 仗 着 这 饮 食 的 力 ， 走 了 四 十 昼 夜 ， 到 了 神 的 山 ， 就 是 何 烈 山 。 \n [kjv] And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God. \n [bbe] So he got up and took food and drink, and in the strength of that food he went on for forty days and nights, to Horeb, the mountain of God. \n 19:9 [hgb] 他 在 那 里 进 了 一 个 洞 ， 就 住 在 洞 中 。 耶 和 华 的 话 临 到 他 说 ， 以 利 亚 阿 ， 你 在 这 里 作 什 么 。 \n [kjv] And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah? \n [bbe] And there he went into a hole in the rock for the night; then the word of the Lord came to him, saying, What are you doing here, Elijah? \n 19:10 [hgb] 他 说 ， 我 为 耶 和 华 万 军 之 神 大 发 热 心 。 因 为 以 色 列 人 背 弃 了 你 的 约 ， 毁 坏 了 你 的 坛 ， 用 刀 杀 了 你 的 先 知 ， 只 剩 下 我 一 个 人 ， 他 们 还 要 寻 索 我 的 命 。 \n [kjv] And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away. \n [bbe] And he said, I have been burning for the honour of the Lord, the God of armies; for the children of Israel have not kept your agreement; they have made destruction of your altars, and have put your prophets to death with the sword: till I, even I, am the only one living; and now they are attempting to take away my life. \n 19:11 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 你 出 来 站 在 山 上 ， 在 我 面 前 。 那 时 耶 和 华 从 那 里 经 过 ， 在 他 面 前 有 烈 风 大 作 ， 崩 山 碎 石 ， 耶 和 华 却 不 在 风 中 。 风 后 地 震 ， 耶 和 华 却 不 在 其 中 。 \n [kjv] And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake: \n [bbe] Then he said, Go out and take your place on the mountain before the Lord. Then the Lord went by, and mountains were parted by the force of a great wind, and rocks were broken before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind. And after the wind there was an earth-shock, but the Lord was not in the earth-shock. \n 19:12 [hgb] 地 震 后 有 火 ， 耶 和 华 也 不 在 火 中 。 火 后 有 微 小 的 声 音 。 \n [kjv] And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice. \n [bbe] And after the earth-shock a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire, the sound of a soft breath. \n 19:13 [hgb] 以 利 亚 听 见 ， 就 用 外 衣 蒙 上 脸 ， 出 来 站 在 洞 口 。 有 声 音 向 他 说 ， 以 利 亚 阿 ， 你 在 这 里 作 什 么 。 \n [kjv] And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah? \n [bbe] And Elijah, hearing it, went out, covering his face with his robe, and took his place in the opening of the hole. And there a voice came to him saying, What are you doing here, Elijah? \n 19:14 [hgb] 他 说 ， 我 为 耶 和 华 万 军 之 神 大 发 热 心 。 因 为 以 色 列 人 背 弃 了 你 的 约 ， 毁 坏 了 你 的 坛 ， 用 刀 杀 了 你 的 先 知 ， 只 剩 下 我 一 个 人 ， 他 们 还 要 寻 索 我 的 命 。 \n [kjv] And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away. \n [bbe] And he said, I have been burning for the honour of the Lord, the God of armies; for the children of Israel have not kept your agreement; they have had your altars broken down, and have put your prophets to death with the sword: till I, even I, am the only one living; and now they are attempting to take away my life. \n 19:15 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 他 说 ， 你 回 去 ， 从 旷 野 往 大 马 色 去 。 到 了 那 里 ， 就 要 膏 哈 薛 作 亚 兰 王 ， \n [kjv] And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria: \n [bbe] And the Lord said to him, Go back on your way through the waste land to Damascus; and when you come there, put the holy oil on Hazael to make him king over Aram; \n 19:16 [hgb] 又 膏 宁 示 的 孙 子 耶 户 作 以 色 列 王 ， 并 膏 亚 伯 米 何 拉 人 沙 法 的 儿 子 以 利 沙 作 先 知 接 续 你 。 \n [kjv] And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room. \n [bbe] And on Jehu, son of Nimshi, making him king over Israel; and on Elisha, the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah, to be prophet in your place. \n 19:17 [hgb] 将 来 躲 避 哈 薛 之 刀 的 ， 必 被 耶 户 所 杀 。 躲 避 耶 户 之 刀 的 ， 必 被 以 利 沙 所 杀 。 \n [kjv] And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay. \n [bbe] And it will come about that the man who gets away safe from the sword of Hazael, Jehu will put to death; and whoever gets away safe from the sword of Jehu, Elisha will put to death. \n 19:18 [hgb] 但 我 在 以 色 列 人 中 为 自 己 留 下 七 千 人 ， 是 未 曾 向 巴 力 屈 膝 的 ， 未 曾 与 巴 力 亲 嘴 的 。 \n [kjv] Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him. \n [bbe] But I will keep safe seven thousand in Israel, all those whose knees have not been bent to Baal, and whose mouths have given him no kisses. \n 19:19 [hgb] 于 是 ， 以 利 亚 离 开 那 里 走 了 ， 遇 见 沙 法 的 儿 子 以 利 沙 耕 地 。 在 他 前 头 有 十 二 对 牛 ， 自 己 赶 着 第 十 二 对 。 以 利 亚 到 他 那 里 去 ， 将 自 己 的 外 衣 搭 在 他 身 上 。 \n [kjv] So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him. \n [bbe] So he went away from there and came across Elisha, the son of Shaphat, ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen, he himself walking with the twelfth; and Elijah went up to him and put his robe on him. \n 19:20 [hgb] 以 利 沙 就 离 开 牛 ， 跑 到 以 利 亚 那 里 ， 说 ， 求 你 容 我 先 与 父 母 亲 嘴 ， 然 后 我 便 跟 随 你 。 以 利 亚 对 他 说 ， 你 回 去 吧 ， 我 向 你 作 了 什 么 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee? \n [bbe] And letting the oxen be where they were, he came running after Elijah, and said, Only let me give a kiss to my father and mother, and then I will come after you. But he said to him, Go back again; for what have I done to you? \n 19:21 [hgb] 以 利 沙 就 离 开 他 回 去 ， 宰 了 一 对 牛 ， 用 套 牛 的 器 具 煮 肉 给 民 吃 ， 随 后 就 起 身 跟 随 以 利 亚 ， 服 事 他 。 \n [kjv] And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him. \n [bbe] And he went back, and took the oxen and put them to death, and cooking their flesh with the yokes of the oxen, he gave the people a feast. Then he got up and went after Elijah and became his servant. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/107/1552.html","bookId":187,"book":{"id":187,"title":"Kings列王记上","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 大 卫 王 年 纪 老 迈 ， 虽 用 被 遮 盖 ， 仍 不 觉 暖 。 [kjv] Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat. ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/107","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
