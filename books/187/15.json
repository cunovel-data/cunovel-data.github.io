{"id":5803,"no":15,"title":"Chapter 15","content":"15:1 [hgb] 尼 八 的 儿 子 耶 罗 波 安 王 十 八 年 ， 亚 比 央 登 基 作 犹 大 王 ， \\n\\n [kjv] Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah. \\n\\n [bbe] Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, Abijam became king over Judah. \\n\\n 15:2 [hgb] 在 耶 路 撒 冷 作 王 三 年 。 他 母 亲 名 叫 玛 迦 ， 是 押 沙 龙 的 女 儿 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother\u0027s name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom. \\n\\n [bbe] For three years he was king in Jerusalem: and his mother\u0027s name was Maacah, the daughter of Abishalom. \\n\\n 15:3 [hgb] 亚 比 央 行 他 父 亲 在 他 以 前 所 行 的 一 切 恶 ， 他 的 心 不 像 他 祖 大 卫 的 心 ， 诚 诚 实 实 地 顺 服 耶 和 华 他 的 神 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father. \\n\\n [bbe] And he did the same sins which his father had done before him: his heart was not completely true to the Lord his God, like the heart of David his father. \\n\\n 15:4 [hgb] 然 而 耶 和 华 他 的 神 因 大 卫 的 缘 故 ， 仍 使 他 在 耶 路 撒 冷 有 灯 光 ， 叫 他 儿 子 接 续 他 作 王 ， 坚 立 耶 路 撒 冷 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Nevertheless for David\u0027s sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem: \\n\\n [bbe] But because of David, the Lord gave him a light in Jerusalem, making his sons king after him, so that Jerusalem might be safe; \\n\\n 15:5 [hgb] 因 为 大 卫 除 了 赫 人 乌 利 亚 那 件 事 ， 都 是 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 正 的 事 ， 一 生 没 有 违 背 耶 和 华 一 切 所 吩 咐 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite. \\n\\n [bbe] Because David did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, and never in all his life went against his orders, but only in the question of Uriah the Hittite. \\n\\n 15:6 [hgb] 罗 波 安 在 世 的 日 子 常 与 耶 罗 波 安 争 战 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life. \\n\\n [bbe] ... \\n\\n 15:7 [hgb] 亚 比 央 其 余 的 事 ， 凡 他 所 行 的 ， 都 写 在 犹 大 列 王 记 上 。 亚 比 央 常 与 耶 罗 波 安 争 战 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam. \\n\\n [bbe] Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all he did, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam. \\n\\n 15:8 [hgb] 亚 比 央 与 他 列 祖 同 睡 ， 葬 在 大 卫 的 城 里 。 他 儿 子 亚 撒 接 续 他 作 王 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Abijam went to rest with his fathers, and they put him into the earth in the town of David: and Asa his son became king in his place. \\n\\n 15:9 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 耶 罗 波 安 二 十 年 ， 亚 撒 登 基 作 犹 大 王 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah. \\n\\n [bbe] In the twentieth year that Jeroboam was king of Israel, Asa became king over Judah. \\n\\n 15:10 [hgb] 在 耶 路 撒 冷 作 王 四 十 一 年 。 他 祖 母 名 叫 玛 迦 ， 是 押 沙 龙 的 女 儿 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother\u0027s name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom. \\n\\n [bbe] And he was king for forty-one years in Jerusalem; his mother\u0027s name was Maacah, the daughter of Abishalom. \\n\\n 15:11 [hgb] 亚 撒 效 法 他 祖 大 卫 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 正 的 事 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did David his father. \\n\\n [bbe] Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as David his father did. \\n\\n 15:12 [hgb] 从 国 中 除 去 娈 童 ， 又 除 掉 他 列 祖 所 造 的 一 切 偶 像 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. \\n\\n [bbe] Those used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods he sent out of the country, and he took away all the images which his fathers had made. \\n\\n 15:13 [hgb] 并 且 贬 了 他 祖 母 玛 迦 太 后 的 位 ， 因 她 造 了 可 憎 的 偶 像 亚 舍 拉 。 亚 撒 砍 下 她 的 偶 像 ， 烧 在 汲 沦 溪 边 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron. \\n\\n [bbe] And he would not let Maacah his mother be queen, because she had made a disgusting image for Asherah; and Asa had the image cut down and burned by the stream Kidron. \\n\\n 15:14 [hgb] 只 是 丘 坛 还 没 有 废 去 。 亚 撒 一 生 却 向 耶 和 华 存 诚 实 的 心 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa\u0027s heart was perfect with the LORD all his days. \\n\\n [bbe] The high places, however, were not taken away: but still the heart of Asa was true to the Lord all his life. \\n\\n 15:15 [hgb] 亚 撒 将 他 父 亲 所 分 别 为 圣 ， 与 自 己 所 分 别 为 圣 的 金 银 和 器 皿 ， 都 奉 到 耶 和 华 的 殿 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels. \\n\\n [bbe] He took into the house of the Lord all the things which his father had made holy, and those which he himself had made holy, silver and gold and vessels. \\n\\n 15:16 [hgb] 亚 撒 和 以 色 列 王 巴 沙 在 世 的 日 子 常 常 争 战 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. \\n\\n [bbe] Now there was war between Asa and Baasha, king of Israel, all their days. \\n\\n 15:17 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 巴 沙 上 来 要 攻 击 犹 大 ， 修 筑 拉 玛 ， 不 许 人 从 犹 大 王 亚 撒 那 里 出 入 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. \\n\\n [bbe] And Baasha, king of Israel, went up against Judah, building Ramah, so that no one was able to go out or in to Asa, king of Judah. \\n\\n 15:18 [hgb] 于 是 亚 撒 将 耶 和 华 殿 和 王 宫 府 库 里 所 剩 下 的 金 银 都 交 在 他 臣 仆 手 中 ， 打 发 他 们 往 住 大 马 色 的 亚 兰 王 希 旬 的 孙 子 ， 他 伯 利 们 的 儿 子 便 哈 达 那 里 去 ， \\n\\n [kjv] Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king\u0027s house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying, \\n\\n [bbe] Then Asa took all the silver and gold which was still stored in the Lord\u0027s house, and in the king\u0027s house, and sent them, in the care of his servants, to Ben-hadad, son of Tabrimmon, son of Rezon, king of Aram, at Damascus, saying, \\n\\n 15:19 [hgb] 说 ， 你 父 曾 与 我 父 立 约 ， 我 与 你 也 要 立 约 。 现 在 我 将 金 银 送 你 为 礼 物 ， 求 你 废 掉 你 与 以 色 列 王 巴 沙 所 立 的 约 ， 使 他 离 开 我 。 \\n\\n [kjv] There is a league between me and thee, and between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me. \\n\\n [bbe] Let there be an agreement between me and you as there was between my father and your father: see, I have sent you an offering of silver and gold; go and put an end to your agreement with Baasha, king of Israel, so that he may give up attacking me. \\n\\n 15:20 [hgb] 便 哈 达 听 从 亚 撒 王 的 话 ， 派 军 长 去 攻 击 以 色 列 的 城 邑 。 他 们 就 攻 破 以 云 ， 但 ， 亚 伯 伯 玛 迦 ， 基 尼 烈 全 境 ， 拿 弗 他 利 全 境 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali. \\n\\n [bbe] So Ben-hadad did as King Asa said, and sent the captains of his armies against the towns of Israel, attacking Ijon and Dan and Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth as far as all the land of Naphtali. \\n\\n 15:21 [hgb] 巴 沙 听 见 ， 就 停 工 不 修 筑 拉 玛 了 ， 仍 住 在 得 撒 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah. \\n\\n [bbe] And Baasha, hearing of it, put a stop to the building of Ramah, and was living in Tirzah. \\n\\n 15:22 [hgb] 于 是 亚 撒 王 宣 告 犹 大 众 人 ， 不 准 一 个 推 辞 ， 吩 咐 他 们 将 巴 沙 修 筑 拉 玛 所 用 的 石 头 ， 木 头 都 运 去 ， 用 以 修 筑 便 雅 悯 的 迦 巴 和 米 斯 巴 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah. \\n\\n [bbe] Then King Asa got all Judah together, making every man come; and they took away the stones and the wood with which Baasha was building Ramah, and King Asa made use of them for building Geba in the land of Benjamin, and Mizpah. \\n\\n 15:23 [hgb] 亚 撒 其 余 的 事 ， 凡 他 所 行 的 ， 并 他 的 勇 力 与 他 所 建 筑 的 城 邑 ， 都 写 在 犹 大 列 王 记 上 。 亚 撒 年 老 的 时 候 ， 脚 上 有 病 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet. \\n\\n [bbe] Now the rest of the acts of Asa, and his power, and all he did, and the towns of which he was the builder, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah? But when he was old he had a disease of the feet. \\n\\n 15:24 [hgb] 亚 撒 与 他 列 祖 同 睡 ， 葬 在 他 祖 大 卫 城 他 列 祖 的 坟 地 里 。 他 儿 子 约 沙 法 接 续 他 作 王 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead. \\n\\n [bbe] So Asa went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in the town of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son became king in his place. \\n\\n 15:25 [hgb] 犹 大 王 亚 撒 第 二 年 ， 耶 罗 波 安 的 儿 子 拿 答 登 基 作 以 色 列 王 共 二 年 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years. \\n\\n [bbe] Nadab, the son of Jeroboam, became king over Israel in the second year that Asa was king of Judah; and he was king of Israel for two years. \\n\\n 15:26 [hgb] 拿 答 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 事 ， 行 他 父 亲 所 行 的 ， 犯 他 父 亲 使 以 色 列 人 陷 在 罪 里 的 那 罪 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin. \\n\\n [bbe] He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, copying the evil ways of his father, and the sin which he did and made Israel do. \\n\\n 15:27 [hgb] 以 萨 迦 人 亚 希 雅 的 儿 子 巴 沙 背 叛 拿 答 ， 在 非 利 士 的 基 比 顿 杀 了 他 。 那 时 拿 答 和 以 色 列 众 人 正 围 困 基 比 顿 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon. \\n\\n [bbe] And Baasha, the son of Ahijah, of the family of Issachar, made a secret design against him, attacking him at Gibbethon, a town of the Philistines; for Nadab and the armies of Israel were making war on Gibbethon. \\n\\n 15:28 [hgb] 在 犹 大 王 亚 撒 第 三 年 巴 沙 杀 了 他 ， 篡 了 他 的 位 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead. \\n\\n [bbe] In the third year of the rule of Asa, king of Judah, Baasha put him to death, and became king in his place. \\n\\n 15:29 [hgb] 巴 沙 一 作 王 就 杀 了 耶 罗 波 安 的 全 家 ， 凡 有 气 息 的 没 有 留 下 一 个 ， 都 灭 尽 了 ， 正 应 验 耶 和 华 借 他 仆 人 示 罗 人 亚 希 雅 所 说 的 话 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite: \\n\\n [bbe] And straight away when he became king, he sent destruction on all the offspring of Jeroboam; there was not one living person of all the family of Jeroboam whom he did not put to death, so the word of the Lord, which he said by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite, came about; \\n\\n 15:30 [hgb] 这 是 因 为 耶 罗 波 安 所 犯 的 罪 使 以 色 列 人 陷 在 罪 里 ， 惹 动 耶 和 华 以 色 列 神 的 怒 气 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger. \\n\\n [bbe] Because of the sins which Jeroboam did and made Israel do, moving the Lord, the God of Israel, to wrath. \\n\\n 15:31 [hgb] 拿 答 其 余 的 事 ， 凡 他 所 行 的 ， 都 写 在 以 色 列 诸 王 记 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? \\n\\n [bbe] Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all he did, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel? \\n\\n 15:32 [hgb] 亚 撒 和 以 色 列 王 巴 沙 在 世 的 日 子 常 常 争 战 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. \\n\\n [bbe] And there was war between Asa and Baasha, king of Israel, all their days. \\n\\n 15:33 [hgb] 犹 大 王 亚 撒 第 三 年 ， 亚 希 雅 的 儿 子 巴 沙 在 得 撒 登 基 作 以 色 列 众 人 的 王 共 二 十 四 年 。 \\n\\n [kjv] In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years. \\n\\n [bbe] In the third year of the rule of Asa, king of Judah, Baasha, the son of Ahijah, became king over all Israel in Tirzah, and was king for twenty-four years. \\n\\n 15:34 [hgb] 他 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 事 ， 行 耶 罗 波 安 所 行 的 道 ， 犯 他 使 以 色 列 人 陷 在 罪 里 的 那 罪 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin. \\n\\n [bbe] He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, copying the evil ways of Jeroboam and the sin which he made Israel do. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/107/1548.html","bookId":187,"book":{"id":187,"title":"Kings列王记上","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 大 卫 王 年 纪 老 迈 ， 虽 用 被 遮 盖 ， 仍 不 觉 暖 。 [kjv] Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat. ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/107","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
