{"id":5810,"no":22,"title":"Chapter 22","content":"22:1 [hgb] 亚 兰 国 和 以 色 列 国 三 年 没 有 争 战 。 [kjv] And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel. [bbe] Now for three years there was no war between Aram and Israel. 22:2 [hgb] 到 第 三 年 ， 犹 大 王 约 沙 法 下 去 见 以 色 列 王 。 [kjv] And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel. [bbe] And it came about in the third year, that Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, came down to the king of Israel. 22:3 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 对 臣 仆 说 ， 你 们 不 知 道 基 列 的 拉 末 是 属 我 们 的 吗 ？ 我 们 岂 可 静 坐 不 动 ， 不 从 亚 兰 王 手 里 夺 回 来 吗 ？ [kjv] And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria? [bbe] And the king of Israel said to his servants, Do you not see that Ramoth-gilead is ours? and we are doing nothing to get it back from the hands of the king of Aram. 22:4 [hgb] 亚 哈 问 约 沙 法 说 ， 你 肯 同 我 去 攻 取 基 列 的 拉 末 吗 ？ 约 沙 法 对 以 色 列 王 说 ， 你 我 不 分 彼 此 ， 我 的 民 与 你 的 民 一 样 ， 我 的 马 与 你 的 马 一 样 。 [kjv] And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses. [bbe] And he said to Jehoshaphat, Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead to make war? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as you are: my people as your people, my horses as your horses. 22:5 [hgb] 约 沙 法 对 以 色 列 王 说 ， 请 你 先 求 问 耶 和 华 。 [kjv] And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day. [bbe] Then Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Let us now get directions from the Lord. 22:6 [hgb] 于 是 以 色 列 王 招 聚 先 知 ， 约 有 四 百 人 ， 问 他 们 说 ， 我 上 去 攻 取 基 列 的 拉 末 可 以 不 可 以 。 他 们 说 ， 可 以 上 去 ， 因 为 主 必 将 那 城 交 在 王 的 手 里 。 [kjv] Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king. [bbe] So the king of Israel got all the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, Am I to go to Ramoth-gilead to make war or not? And they said, Go up: for the Lord will give it into the hands of the king. 22:7 [hgb] 约 沙 法 说 ， 这 里 不 是 还 有 耶 和 华 的 先 知 ， 我 们 可 以 求 问 他 吗 ？ [kjv] And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him? [bbe] But Jehoshaphat said, Is there no other prophet of the Lord here from whom we may get directions? 22:8 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 对 约 沙 法 说 ， 还 有 一 个 人 ， 是 音 拉 的 儿 子 米 该 雅 ， 我 们 可 以 托 他 求 问 耶 和 华 。 只 是 我 恨 他 。 因 为 他 指 着 我 所 说 的 预 言 ， 不 说 吉 语 ， 单 说 凶 言 。 约 沙 法 说 ， 王 不 必 这 样 说 。 [kjv] And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so. [bbe] And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is still one man by whom we may get directions from the Lord, Micaiah, son of Imlah; but I have no love for him, for he is a prophet of evil to me and not of good. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so. 22:9 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 就 召 了 一 个 太 监 来 ， 说 ， 你 快 去 ， 将 音 拉 的 儿 子 米 该 雅 召 来 。 [kjv] Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten hither Micaiah the son of Imlah. [bbe] Then the king of Israel sent for one of his unsexed servants and said, Go quickly and come back with Micaiah, the son of Imlah. 22:10 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 和 犹 大 王 约 沙 法 在 撒 玛 利 亚 城 门 前 的 空 场 上 ， 各 穿 朝 服 ， 坐 在 位 上 ， 所 有 的 先 知 都 在 他 们 面 前 说 预 言 。 [kjv] And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them. [bbe] Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, were seated on their seats of authority, dressed in their robes, by the doorway into Samaria; and all the prophets were acting as prophets before them. 22:11 [hgb] 基 拿 拿 的 儿 子 西 底 家 造 了 两 个 铁 角 ， 说 ， 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 你 要 用 这 角 抵 触 亚 兰 人 ， 直 到 将 他 们 灭 尽 。 [kjv] And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them. [bbe] And Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, made himself horns of iron and said, The Lord says, Pushing back the Aramaeans with these, you will put an end to them completely. 22:12 [hgb] 所 有 的 先 知 也 都 这 样 预 言 说 ， 可 以 上 基 列 的 拉 末 去 ， 必 然 得 胜 ， 因 为 耶 和 华 必 将 那 城 交 在 王 的 手 中 。 [kjv] And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the king\u0027s hand. [bbe] And all the prophets said the same thing, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and it will go well for you, for the Lord will give it into the hands of the king. 22:13 [hgb] 那 去 召 米 该 雅 的 使 者 对 米 该 雅 说 。 众 先 知 一 口 同 音 地 都 向 王 说 吉 言 ， 你 不 如 与 他 们 说 一 样 的 话 ， 也 说 吉 言 。 [kjv] And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good. [bbe] Now the servant who had gone to get Micaiah said to him, See now, all the prophets with one voice are saying good things to the king; so let your words be like theirs and say good things. 22:14 [hgb] 米 该 雅 说 ， 我 指 着 永 生 的 耶 和 华 起 誓 ， 耶 和 华 对 我 说 什 么 ， 我 就 说 什 么 。 [kjv] And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto me, that will I speak. [bbe] And Micaiah said, By the living Lord, whatever the Lord says to me I will say. 22:15 [hgb] 米 该 雅 到 王 面 前 ， 王 问 他 说 ， 米 该 雅 阿 ， 我 们 上 去 攻 取 基 列 的 拉 末 可 以 不 可 以 。 他 回 答 说 ， 可 以 上 去 ， 必 然 得 胜 ， 耶 和 华 必 将 那 城 交 在 王 的 手 中 。 [kjv] So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king. [bbe] When he came to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah, are we to go to Ramoth-gilead to make war or not? And in answer he said, Go up, and it will go well for you; and the Lord will give it into the hands of the king. 22:16 [hgb] 王 对 他 说 ， 我 当 嘱 咐 你 几 次 ， 你 才 奉 耶 和 华 的 名 向 我 说 实 话 呢 ？ [kjv] And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD? [bbe] Then the king said to him, Have I not, again and again, put you on your oath to say nothing to me but what is true in the name of the Lord? 22:17 [hgb] 米 该 雅 说 ， 我 看 见 以 色 列 众 民 散 在 山 上 ， 如 同 没 有 牧 人 的 羊 群 一 般 。 耶 和 华 说 ， 这 民 没 有 主 人 ， 他 们 可 以 平 平 安 安 地 各 归 各 家 去 。 [kjv] And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace. [bbe] Then he said, I saw all Israel wandering on the mountains like sheep without a keeper; and the Lord said, These have no master: let them go back, every man to his house in peace. 22:18 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 对 约 沙 法 说 ， 我 岂 没 有 告 诉 你 ， 这 人 指 着 我 所 说 的 预 言 ， 不 说 吉 语 单 说 凶 言 吗 ？ [kjv] And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil? [bbe] And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not say that he would not be a prophet of good but of evil? 22:19 [hgb] 米 该 雅 说 ， 你 要 听 耶 和 华 的 话 。 我 看 见 耶 和 华 坐 在 宝 座 上 ， 天 上 的 万 军 侍 立 在 他 左 右 。 [kjv] And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left. [bbe] And he said, Give ear now to the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord seated on his seat of power, with all the army of heaven in their places round him at his right hand and at his left. 22:20 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 谁 去 引 诱 亚 哈 上 基 列 的 拉 末 去 阵 亡 呢 ？ 这 个 就 这 样 说 ， 那 个 就 那 样 说 。 [kjv] And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner. [bbe] And the Lord said, How may Ahab be tricked into going up to Ramoth-gilead to his death? And one said one thing and one another. 22:21 [hgb] 随 后 有 一 个 神 灵 出 来 ， 站 在 耶 和 华 面 前 ， 说 ， 我 去 引 诱 他 。 [kjv] And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him. [bbe] Then a spirit came forward and took his place before the Lord and said, I will get him to do it by a trick. 22:22 [hgb] 耶 和 华 问 他 说 ， 你 用 何 法 呢 ？ 他 说 ， 我 去 ， 要 在 他 众 先 知 口 中 作 谎 言 的 灵 。 耶 和 华 说 ， 这 样 ， 你 必 能 引 诱 他 ， 你 去 如 此 行 吧 。 [kjv] And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so. [bbe] And the Lord said, How? And he said, I will go out and be a spirit of deceit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Your trick will have its effect on him: go out and do so. 22:23 [hgb] 现 在 耶 和 华 使 谎 言 的 灵 入 了 你 这 些 先 知 的 口 ， 并 且 耶 和 华 已 经 命 定 降 祸 与 你 。 [kjv] Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee. [bbe] And now, see, the Lord has put a spirit of deceit in the mouth of all these your prophets; and the Lord has said evil against you. 22:24 [hgb] 基 拿 拿 的 儿 子 西 底 家 前 来 ， 打 米 该 雅 的 脸 ， 说 ， 耶 和 华 的 灵 从 哪 里 离 开 我 与 你 说 话 呢 ？ [kjv] But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee? [bbe] Then Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, came near and gave Micaiah a blow on the side of the face, saying, Where is the spirit of the Lord whose word is in you? 22:25 [hgb] 米 该 雅 说 ， 你 进 严 密 的 屋 子 藏 躲 的 那 日 ， 就 必 看 见 了 。 [kjv] And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself. [bbe] And Micaiah said, Truly, you will see on that day when you go into an inner room to keep yourself safe. 22:26 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 说 ， 将 米 该 雅 带 回 ， 交 给 邑 宰 亚 们 和 王 的 儿 子 约 阿 施 ， 说 [kjv] And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king\u0027s son; [bbe] And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon, the ruler of the town, and to Joash, the king\u0027s son; 22:27 [hgb] 王 如 此 说 ， 把 这 个 人 下 在 监 里 ， 使 他 受 苦 ， 吃 不 饱 喝 不 足 ， 等 候 我 平 平 安 安 地 回 来 。 [kjv] And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace. [bbe] And say, It is the king\u0027s order that this man is to be put in prison and given prison food till I come again in peace. 22:28 [hgb] 米 该 雅 说 ， 你 若 能 平 平 安 安 地 回 来 ， 那 就 是 耶 和 华 没 有 借 我 说 这 话 了 。 又 说 ， 众 民 哪 ， 你 们 都 要 听 。 [kjv] And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you. [bbe] And Micaiah said, If you come back at all in peace, the Lord has not sent his word by me. 22:29 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 和 犹 大 王 约 沙 法 上 基 列 的 拉 末 去 了 。 [kjv] So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead. [bbe] So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went up to Ramoth-gilead. 22:30 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 对 约 沙 法 说 ， 我 要 改 装 上 阵 ， 你 可 以 仍 穿 王 服 。 以 色 列 王 就 改 装 上 阵 。 [kjv] And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle. [bbe] And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will make a change in my clothing, so that I do not seem to be the king, and will go into the fight; but do you put on your robes. So the king of Israel made a change in his dress and went into the fight. 22:31 [hgb] 先 是 亚 兰 王 吩 咐 他 的 三 十 二 个 车 兵 长 说 ， 他 们 的 兵 将 ， 无 论 大 小 ， 你 们 都 不 可 与 他 们 争 战 ， 只 要 与 以 色 列 王 争 战 。 [kjv] But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel. [bbe] Now the king of Aram had given orders to the thirty-two captains of his war-carriages, saying, Make no attack on small or great, but only on the king of Israel. 22:32 [hgb] 车 兵 长 看 见 约 沙 法 ， 便 说 ， 这 必 是 以 色 列 王 。 就 转 过 去 与 他 争 战 ， 约 沙 法 便 呼 喊 。 [kjv] And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out. [bbe] So when the captains of the war-carriages saw Jehoshaphat, they said, Truly, this is the king of Israel; and turning against him, they came round him, but Jehoshaphat gave a cry. 22:33 [hgb] 车 兵 长 见 不 是 以 色 列 王 ， 就 转 去 不 追 他 了 。 [kjv] And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him. [bbe] And when the captains of the war-carriages saw that he was not the king of Israel, they went back from going after him. 22:34 [hgb] 有 一 人 随 便 开 弓 ， 恰 巧 射 入 以 色 列 王 的 甲 缝 里 。 王 对 赶 车 的 说 ， 我 受 了 重 伤 ， 你 转 过 车 来 ， 拉 我 出 阵 吧 。 [kjv] And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded. [bbe] And a certain man sent an arrow from his bow without thought of its direction, and gave the king of Israel a wound where his breastplate was joined to his clothing; so he said to the driver of his war-carriage, Go to one side and take me away out of the army, for I am badly wounded. 22:35 [hgb] 那 日 ， 阵 势 越 战 越 猛 ， 有 人 扶 王 站 在 车 上 ， 抵 挡 亚 兰 人 。 到 晚 上 ， 王 就 死 了 ， 血 从 伤 处 流 在 车 中 。 [kjv] And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot. [bbe] But the fight became more violent while the day went on; and the king was supported in his war-carriage facing the Aramaeans, and the floor of the carriage was covered with the blood from his wound, and by evening he was dead. 22:36 [hgb] 约 在 日 落 的 时 候 ， 有 号 令 传 遍 军 中 ， 说 ， 各 归 本 城 ， 各 归 本 地 吧 。 [kjv] And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country. [bbe] And about sundown a cry went up from all parts of the army, saying, Let every man go back to his town and his country, for the king is dead. 22:37 [hgb] 王 既 死 了 ， 众 人 将 他 送 到 撒 玛 利 亚 ， 就 葬 在 那 里 。 [kjv] So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria. [bbe] And they came to Samaria, and put the king\u0027s body to rest in Samaria. 22:38 [hgb] 又 有 人 把 他 的 车 洗 在 撒 玛 利 亚 的 池 旁 （ 妓 女 在 那 里 洗 澡 ） ， 狗 来 舔 他 的 血 ， 正 如 耶 和 华 所 说 的 话 。 [kjv] And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word of the LORD which he spake. [bbe] And the war-carriage was washed by the pool of Samaria, which was the bathing-place of the loose women, and the dogs were drinking his blood there, as the Lord had said. 22:39 [hgb] 亚 哈 其 余 的 事 ， 凡 他 所 行 的 和 他 所 修 造 的 象 牙 宫 ， 并 所 建 筑 的 一 切 城 邑 ， 都 写 在 以 色 列 诸 王 记 上 。 [kjv] Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? [bbe] Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all he did, and his ivory house, and all the towns of which he was the builder, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel? 22:40 [hgb] 亚 哈 与 他 列 祖 同 睡 。 他 儿 子 亚 哈 谢 接 续 他 作 王 。 [kjv] So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead. [bbe] So Ahab was put to rest with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son became king in his place. 22:41 [hgb] 以 色 列 王 亚 哈 第 四 年 ， 亚 撒 的 儿 子 约 沙 法 登 基 作 了 犹 大 王 。 [kjv] And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. [bbe] And Jehoshaphat, the son of Asa, became king over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab\u0027s rule over Israel. 22:42 [hgb] 约 沙 法 登 基 的 时 候 年 三 十 五 岁 ， 在 耶 路 撒 冷 作 王 二 十 五 年 。 他 母 亲 名 叫 阿 苏 巴 ， 乃 示 利 希 的 女 儿 。 [kjv] Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother\u0027s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. [bbe] Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he was king for twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother\u0027s name was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi. 22:43 [hgb] 约 沙 法 行 他 父 亲 亚 撒 所 行 的 道 ， 不 偏 离 左 右 ， 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 正 的 事 。 只 是 丘 坛 还 没 有 废 去 ， 百 姓 仍 在 那 里 献 祭 烧 香 。 [kjv] And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places. [bbe] He did as Asa his father had done, not turning away from it, but doing what was right in the eyes of the Lord; but the high places were not taken away: the people went on making offerings and burning them in the high places. 22:44 [hgb] 约 沙 法 与 以 色 列 王 和 好 。 [kjv] And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel. [bbe] And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel. 22:45 [hgb] 约 沙 法 其 余 的 事 和 他 所 显 出 的 勇 力 ， 并 他 怎 样 争 战 ， 都 写 在 犹 大 列 王 记 上 。 [kjv] Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? [bbe] Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his great power, and how he went to war, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah? 22:46 [hgb] 约 沙 法 将 他 父 亲 亚 撒 在 世 所 剩 下 的 娈 童 都 从 国 中 除 去 了 。 [kjv] And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land. [bbe] He put an end to the rest of those who were used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods, all those who were still in the land in the time of his father Asa. 22:47 [hgb] 那 时 以 东 没 有 王 ， 有 总 督 治 理 。 [kjv] There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king. [bbe] At that time there was no king in Edom; 22:48 [hgb] 约 沙 法 制 造 他 施 船 只 ， 要 往 俄 斐 去 ， 将 金 子 运 来 。 只 是 没 有 去 ， 因 为 船 在 以 旬 迦 别 破 坏 了 。 [kjv] Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber. [bbe] And the representative of King Jehoshaphat made a Tarshish-ship to go to Ophir for gold, but it did not go, because it was broken at Ezion-geber. 22:49 [hgb] 亚 哈 的 儿 子 亚 哈 谢 对 约 沙 法 说 ， 容 我 的 仆 人 和 你 的 仆 人 坐 船 同 去 吧 。 约 沙 法 却 不 肯 。 [kjv] Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not. [bbe] Then Ahaziah, the son of Ahab, said to Jehoshaphat, Let my men go with yours in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not let them. 22:50 [hgb] 约 沙 法 与 列 祖 同 睡 。 葬 在 大 卫 城 他 列 祖 的 坟 地 里 。 他 儿 子 约 兰 接 续 他 作 王 。 [kjv] And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead. [bbe] Then Jehoshaphat went to rest with his fathers, and his body was put into the earth in the town of David his father; and Jehoram his son became king in his place. 22:51 [hgb] 犹 大 王 约 沙 法 十 七 年 ， 亚 哈 的 儿 子 亚 哈 谢 在 撒 玛 利 亚 登 基 ， 作 以 色 列 王 共 二 年 。 [kjv] Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel. [bbe] Ahaziah, the son of Ahab, became king over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of the rule of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, and he was king over Israel for two years. 22:52 [hgb] 他 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 事 ， 效 法 他 的 父 母 ， 又 行 尼 八 的 儿 子 耶 罗 波 安 使 以 色 列 人 陷 在 罪 里 的 事 。 [kjv] And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin: [bbe] He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, going in the ways of his father and his mother, and in the ways of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who made Israel do evil. 22:53 [hgb] 他 照 他 父 亲 一 切 所 行 的 ， 事 奉 敬 拜 巴 力 ， 惹 耶 和 华 以 色 列 神 的 怒 气 。 [kjv] For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done. [bbe] He was a servant and worshipper of Baal, moving the Lord, the God of Israel, to wrath, as his father had done.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/107/1555.html","bookId":187,"book":{"id":187,"title":"Kings列王记上","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 大 卫 王 年 纪 老 迈 ， 虽 用 被 遮 盖 ， 仍 不 觉 暖 。 [kjv] Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat. ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/107","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
