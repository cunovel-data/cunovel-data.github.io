there was no secret which the king did not make clear to her. \n 10:4 [hgb] 示 巴 女 王 见 所 罗 门 大 有 智 慧 ， 和 他 所 建 造 的 宫 室 ， \n [kjv] And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon\u0027s wisdom, and the house that he had built, \n [bbe] And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house which he had made, \n 10:5 [hgb] 席 上 的 珍 馐 美 味 ， 群 臣 分 列 而 坐 ， 仆 人 两 旁 侍 立 ， 以 及 他 们 的 衣 服 装 饰 和 酒 政 的 衣 服 装 饰 ， 又 见 他 上 耶 和 华 殿 的 台 阶 （ 或 作 他 在 耶 和 华 殿 里 所 献 的 燔 祭 ） ， 就 诧 异 得 神 不 守 舍 。 \n [kjv] And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her. \n [bbe] And the food at his table, and all his servants seated there, and those who were waiting on him in their places, and their robes, and his wine-servants, and the burned offerings which he made in the house of the Lord, there was no more spirit in her. \n 10:6 [hgb] 对 王 说 ， 我 在 本 国 里 所 听 见 论 到 你 的 事 和 你 的 智 慧 实 在 是 真 的 。 \n [kjv] And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom. \n [bbe] And she said to the king, The account which was given to me in my country of your acts and your wisdom was true. \n 10:7 [hgb] 我 先 不 信 那 些 话 ， 及 至 我 来 亲 眼 见 了 才 知 道 人 所 告 诉 我 的 还 不 到 一 半 。 你 的 智 慧 和 你 的 福 分 越 过 我 所 听 见 的 风 声 。 \n [kjv] Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard. \n [bbe] But I had no faith in what was said about you, till I came and saw for myself; and now I see that it was not half the story; your wisdom and your wealth are much greater than they said. \n 10:8 [hgb] 你 的 臣 子 ， 你 的 仆 人 常 侍 立 在 你 面 前 听 你 智 慧 的 话 是 有 福 的 。 \n [kjv] Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom. \n [bbe] Happy are your wives, happy are these your servants whose place is ever before you, hearing your words of wisdom. \n 10:9 [hgb] 耶 和 华 你 的 神 是 应 当 称 颂 的 。 他 喜 悦 你 ， 使 你 坐 以 色 列 的 国 位 。 因 为 他 永 远 爱 以 色 列 ， 所 以 立 你 作 王 ， 使 你 秉 公 行 义 。 \n [kjv] Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice. \n [bbe] May the Lord your God be praised, whose pleasure it was to put you on the seat of the kingdom of Israel; because the Lord\u0027s love for Israel is eternal, he has made you king, to be their judge in righteousness. \n 10:10 [hgb] 于 是 ， 示 巴 女 王 将 一 百 二 十 他 连 得 金 子 和 宝 石 ， 与 极 多 的 香 料 ， 送 给 所 罗 门 王 。 她 送 给 王 的 香 料 ， 以 后 奉 来 的 不 再 有 这 样 多 。 \n [kjv] And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon. \n [bbe] And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and a great store of spices and jewels: never again was such a wealth of spices seen as that which the queen of Sheba gave King Solomon. \n 10:11 [hgb] 希 兰 的 船 只 从 俄 斐 运 了 金 子 来 ， 又 从 俄 斐 运 了 许 多 檀 香 木 （ 或 作 乌 木 下 同 ） 和 宝 石 来 。 \n [kjv] And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones. \n [bbe] And the sea-force of Hiram, in addition to gold from Ophir, came back with much sandal-wood and jewels. \n 10:12 [hgb] 王 用 檀 香 木 为 耶 和 华 殿 和 王 宫 作 栏 杆 ， 又 为 歌 唱 的 人 作 琴 瑟 。 以 后 再 没 有 这 样 的 檀 香 木 进 国 来 ， 也 没 有 人 看 见 过 ， 直 到 如 今 。 \n [kjv] And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king\u0027s house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day. \n [bbe] And from the sandal-wood the king made pillars for the house of the Lord, and for the king\u0027s house, and instruments of music for the makers of melody: never has such sandal-wood been seen to this day. \n 10:13 [hgb] 示 巴 女 王 一 切 所 要 所 求 的 ， 所 罗 门 王 都 送 给 她 ， 另 外 照 自 己 的 厚 意 馈 送 她 。 于 是 女 王 和 她 臣 仆 转 回 本 国 去 了 。 \n [kjv] And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants. \n [bbe] And King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she made request for, in addition to what he gave her freely from the impulse of his heart. So she went back to her country, she and her servants. \n 10:14 [hgb] 所 罗 门 每 年 所 得 的 金 子 共 有 六 百 六 十 六 他 连 得 。 \n [kjv] Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold, \n [bbe] Now the weight of gold which came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents; \n 10:15 [hgb] 另 外 还 有 商 人 和 杂 族 的 诸 王 ， 与 国 中 的 省 长 ， 所 进 的 金 子 。 （ 杂 族 在 历 代 下 九 章 十 四 节 作 亚 拉 伯 ） \n [kjv] Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country. \n [bbe] In addition to what came to him from the business of the traders, and from all the kings of the Arabians, and from the rulers of the country. \n 10:16 [hgb] 所 罗 门 王 用 锤 出 来 的 金 子 打 成 挡 牌 二 百 面 ， 每 面 用 金 子 六 百 舍 客 勒 。 \n [kjv] And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target. \n [bbe] And Solomon made two hundred body-covers of hammered gold, every one having six hundred shekels of gold in it. \n 10:17 [hgb] 又 用 锤 出 来 的 金 子 打 成 盾 牌 三 百 面 ， 每 面 用 金 子 三 弥 那 ， 都 放 在 利 巴 嫩 林 宫 里 。 \n [kjv] And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon. \n [bbe] And he made three hundred smaller body-covers of hammered gold, with three pounds of gold in every cover: and the king put them in the house of the Woods of Lebanon. \n 10:18 [hgb] 王 用 象 牙 制 造 一 个 宝 座 ， 用 精 金 包 裹 。 \n [kjv] Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold. \n [bbe] Then the king made a great ivory seat, plated with the best gold. \n 10:19 [hgb] 宝 座 有 六 层 台 阶 ， 座 的 后 背 是 圆 的 ， 两 旁 有 扶 手 ， 靠 近 扶 手 有 两 个 狮 子 站 立 。 \n [kjv] The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays. \n [bbe] There were six steps going up to it, and the top of it was round at the back, there were arms on the two sides of the seat, and two lions by the side of the arms; \n 10:20 [hgb] 六 层 台 阶 上 有 十 二 个 狮 子 站 立 ， 每 层 有 两 个 ， 左 边 一 个 ， 右 边 一 个 。 在 列 国 中 没 有 这 样 作 的 。 \n [kjv] And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom. \n [bbe] And twelve lions were placed on the one side and on the other side on the six steps: there was nothing like it in any kingdom. \n 10:21 [hgb] 所 罗 门 王 一 切 的 饮 器 都 是 金 子 的 。 利 巴 嫩 林 宫 里 的 一 切 器 皿 都 是 精 金 的 。 所 罗 门 年 间 ， 银 子 算 不 了 什 么 。 \n [kjv] And all king Solomon\u0027s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon. \n [bbe] And all King Solomon\u0027s drinking-vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the Woods of Lebanon were of the best gold; not one was of silver, for no one gave a thought to silver in the days of King Solomon. \n 10:22 [hgb] 因 为 王 有 他 施 船 只 与 希 兰 的 船 只 一 同 航 海 ， 三 年 一 次 ， 装 载 金 银 ， 象 牙 ， 猿 猴 ， 孔 雀 回 来 。 \n [kjv] For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks. \n [bbe] For the king had Tarshish-ships at sea with the ships of Hiram; once every three years the Tarshish-ships came with gold and silver and ivory and monkeys and peacocks. \n 10:23 [hgb] 所 罗 门 王 的 财 宝 与 智 慧 胜 过 天 下 的 列 王 。 \n [kjv] So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom. \n [bbe] And King Solomon was greater than all the kings of the earth in wealth and in wisdom. \n 10:24 [hgb] 普 天 下 的 王 都 求 见 所 罗 门 ， 要 听 神 赐 给 他 智 慧 的 话 。 \n [kjv] And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. \n [bbe] And from all over the earth they came to see Solomon and to give ear to his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. \n 10:25 [hgb] 他 们 各 带 贡 物 ， 就 是 金 器 ， 银 器 ， 衣 服 ， 军 械 ， 香 料 ， 骡 马 ， 每 年 有 一 定 之 例 。 \n [kjv] And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year. \n [bbe] And everyone took with him an offering, vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and robes, and coats of metal, and spices, and horses, and beasts of transport, regularly year by year. \n 10:26 [hgb] 所 罗 门 聚 集 战 车 马 兵 ， 有 战 车 一 千 四 百 辆 ， 马 兵 一 万 二 千 名 ， 安 置 在 屯 车 的 城 邑 和 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 就 是 王 那 里 。 \n [kjv] And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem. \n [bbe] And Solomon got together war-carriages and horsemen; he had one thousand, four hundred carriages and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he kept, some in the carriage-towns and some with the king at Jerusalem. \n 10:27 [hgb] 王 在 耶 路 撒 冷 使 银 子 多 如 石 头 ， 香 柏 木 多 如 高 原 的 桑 树 。 \n [kjv] And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance. \n [bbe] And the king made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem and cedars like the sycamore-trees of the lowlands in number. \n 10:28 [hgb] 所 罗 门 的 马 是 从 埃 及 带 来 的 ， 是 王 的 商 人 一 群 一 群 按 着 定 价 买 来 的 。 \n [kjv] And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king\u0027s merchants received the linen yarn at a price. \n [bbe] And Solomon\u0027s horses came from Egypt and from Kue; the king\u0027s traders got them at a price from Kue. \n 10:29 [hgb] 从 埃 及 买 来 的 车 ， 每 辆 价 银 六 百 舍 客 勒 ， 马 每 匹 一 百 五 十 舍 客 勒 。 赫 人 诸 王 和 亚 兰 诸 王 所 买 的 车 马 ， 也 是 按 这 价 值 经 他 们 手 买 来 的 。 \n [kjv] And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means. \n [bbe] A war-carriage might be got from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; they got them at the same rate for all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/107/1543.html","bookId":187,"book":{"id":187,"title":"Kings列王记上","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 大 卫 王 年 纪 老 迈 ， 虽 用 被 遮 盖 ， 仍 不 觉 暖 。 [kjv] Now king David was old and stricken in years;
