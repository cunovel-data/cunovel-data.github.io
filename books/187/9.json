[bbe] The Lord came to him again in a vision, as he had done at Gibeon; 9:3 [hgb] 对 他 说 ， 你 向 我 所 祷 告 祈 求 的 ， 我 都 应 允 了 。 我 已 将 你 所 建 的 这 殿 分 别 为 圣 ， 使 我 的 名 永 远 在 其 中 。 我 的 眼 ， 我 的 心 也 必 常 在 那 里 。 [kjv] And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. [bbe] And the Lord said to him, Your prayers and your requests for grace have come to my ears: I have made holy this house which you have made, and I have put my name there for ever; my eyes and my heart will be there at all times. 9:4 [hgb] 你 若 效 法 你 父 大 卫 ， 存 诚 实 正 直 的 心 行 在 我 面 前 ， 遵 行 我 一 切 所 吩 咐 你 的 ， 谨 守 我 的 律 例 典 章 ， [kjv] And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments: [bbe] As for you, if you will go on your way before me, as David your father did, uprightly and with a true heart, doing what I have given you orders to do, keeping my laws and my decisions; 9:5 [hgb] 我 就 必 坚 固 你 的 国 位 在 以 色 列 中 ， 直 到 永 远 ， 正 如 我 应 许 你 父 大 卫 说 ， 你 的 子 孙 必 不 断 人 坐 以 色 列 的 国 位 。 [kjv] Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel. [bbe] Then I will make the seat of your rule over Israel certain for ever, as I gave my word to David your father, saying, You will never be without a man to be king in Israel. 9:6 [hgb] 倘 若 你 们 和 你 们 的 子 孙 转 去 不 跟 从 我 ， 不 守 我 指 示 你 们 的 诫 命 律 例 ， 去 事 奉 敬 拜 别 神 ， [kjv] But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them: [bbe] But if you are turned from my ways, you or your children, and do not keep my orders and my laws which I have put before you, but go and make yourselves servants to other gods and give them worship: 9:7 [hgb] 我 就 必 将 以 色 列 人 从 我 赐 给 他 们 的 地 上 剪 除 ， 并 且 我 为 己 名 所 分 别 为 圣 的 殿 也 必 舍 弃 不 顾 ， 使 以 色 列 人 在 万 民 中 作 笑 谈 ， 被 讥 诮 。 [kjv] Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people: [bbe] Then I will have Israel cut off from the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have made holy for myself, I will put away from before my eyes; and Israel will be a public example, and a word of shame among all peoples. 9:8 [hgb] 这 殿 虽 然 甚 高 ， 将 来 经 过 的 人 必 惊 讶 ， 嗤 笑 ， 说 ， 耶 和 华 为 何 向 这 地 和 这 殿 如 此 行 呢 ？ [kjv] And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house? [bbe] And this house will become a mass of broken walls, and everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder at it and make whistling sounds; and they will say, Why has the Lord done so to this land and to this house? 9:9 [hgb] 人 必 回 答 说 ， 是 因 此 地 的 人 离 弃 领 他 们 列 祖 出 埃 及 地 之 耶 和 华 他 们 的 神 ， 去 亲 近 别 神 ， 事 奉 敬 拜 他 ， 所 以 耶 和 华 使 这 一 切 灾 祸 临 到 他 们 。 [kjv] And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil. [bbe] And their answer will be, Because they were turned away from the Lord their God, who took their fathers out of the land of Egypt; they took for themselves other gods and gave them worship and became their servants: that is why the Lord has sent all this evil on them. 9:10 [hgb] 所 罗 门 建 造 耶 和 华 殿 和 王 宫 ， 这 两 所 二 十 年 才 完 毕 了 。 [kjv] And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king\u0027s house, [bbe] Now at the end of twenty years, in which time Solomon had put up the two houses, the house of the Lord and the king\u0027s house, 9:11 [hgb] （ 推 罗 王 希 兰 曾 照 所 罗 门 所 要 的 ， 资 助 他 香 柏 木 ， 松 木 ， 和 金 子 ） 所 罗 门 王 就 把 加 利 利 地 的 二 十 座 城 给 了 希 兰 。 [kjv] (Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee. [bbe] (Hiram, king of Tyre, had given Solomon cedar-trees and cypress-trees and gold, as much as he had need of,) King Solomon gave Hiram twenty towns in the land of Galilee. 9:12 [hgb] 希 兰 从 推 罗 出 来 ， 察 看 所 罗 门 给 他 的 城 邑 ， 就 不 喜 悦 ， [kjv] And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not. [bbe] But when Hiram came from Tyre to see the towns which Solomon had given him, he was not pleased with them. 9:13 [hgb] 说 ， 我 兄 阿 ， 你 给 我 的 是 什 么 城 邑 呢 ？ 他 就 给 这 城 邑 之 地 起 名 叫 迦 步 勒 ， 直 到 今 日 。 [kjv] And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day. [bbe] And he said, What sort of towns are these which you have given me, my brother? So they were named the land of Cabul, to this day. 9:14 [hgb] 希 兰 给 所 罗 门 一 百 二 十 他 连 得 金 子 。 [kjv] And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold. [bbe] And Hiram sent the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold. 9:15 [hgb] 所 罗 门 王 挑 取 服 苦 的 人 ， 是 为 建 造 耶 和 华 的 殿 ， 自 己 的 宫 ， 米 罗 ， 耶 路 撒 冷 的 城 墙 ， 夏 琐 ， 米 吉 多 ， 并 基 色 。 [kjv] And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer. [bbe] Now, this was the way of Solomon\u0027s system of forced work for the building of the Lord\u0027s house and of the king\u0027s house, and the Millo and the wall of Jerusalem and Megiddo and Gezer. ... 9:16 [hgb] 先 前 埃 及 王 法 老 上 来 攻 取 基 色 ， 用 火 焚 烧 ， 杀 了 城 内 居 住 的 迦 南 人 ， 将 城 赐 给 他 女 儿 所 罗 门 的 妻 作 妆 奁 。 [kjv] For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon\u0027s wife. [bbe] Pharaoh, king of Egypt, came and took Gezer, burning it down and putting to death the Canaanites living in the town, and he gave it for a bride-offering to his daughter, Solomon\u0027s wife. ... 9:17 [hgb] 所 罗 门 建 造 基 色 ， 下 伯 和 仑 ， [kjv] And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether, [bbe] ... and Solomon was the builder of Gezer and Beth-horon the lower, 9:18 [hgb] 巴 拉 ， 并 国 中 旷 野 里 的 达 莫 ， [kjv] And Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land, [bbe] And Baalath and Tamar in the waste land, in that land; 9:19 [hgb] 又 建 造 所 有 的 积 货 城 ， 并 屯 车 和 马 兵 的 城 ， 与 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 利 巴 嫩 ， 以 及 自 己 治 理 的 全 国 中 所 愿 建 造 的 。 [kjv] And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. [bbe] And all the store-towns and the towns which Solomon had for his war-carriages and for his horsemen, and everything which it was his pleasure to put up in Jerusalem and in Lebanon and in all the land under his rule. 9:20 [hgb] 至 于 国 中 所 剩 下 不 属 以 色 列 人 的 亚 摩 利 人 ， 赫 人 ， 比 利 洗 人 ， 希 未 人 ， 耶 布 斯 人 ， [kjv] And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel, [bbe] As for the rest of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not children of Israel; 9:21 [hgb] 就 是 以 色 列 人 不 能 灭 尽 的 ， 所 罗 门 挑 取 他 们 的 后 裔 作 服 苦 的 奴 仆 ， 直 到 今 日 。 [kjv] Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day. [bbe] Their children who were still in the land, and whom the children of Israel had not been able to put to complete destruction, them did Solomon put to forced work, to this day. 9:22 [hgb] 惟 有 以 色 列 人 ， 所 罗 门 不 使 他 们 作 奴 仆 ， 乃 是 作 他 的 战 士 ， 臣 仆 ， 统 领 ， 军 长 ， 车 兵 长 ， 马 兵 长 。 [kjv] But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen. [bbe] But Solomon did not put the children of Israel to forced work; they were the men of war, his servants, his captains, and his chiefs, captains of his war-carriages and of his horsemen. 9:23 [hgb] 所 罗 门 有 五 百 五 十 督 工 的 ， 监 管 工 人 。 [kjv] These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon\u0027s work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work. [bbe] These were the chiefs of the overseers of Solomon\u0027s work, five hundred and fifty, in authority over the people who did the work. 9:24 [hgb] 法 老 的 女 儿 从 大 卫 城 搬 到 所 罗 门 为 她 建 造 的 宫 里 。 那 时 ， 所 罗 门 才 建 造 米 罗 。 [kjv] But Pharaoh\u0027s daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo. [bbe] At that time Solomon made Pharaoh\u0027s daughter come up from the town of David to the house which he had made for her: then he made the Millo. 9:25 [hgb] 所 罗 门 每 年 三 次 在 他 为 耶 和 华 所 筑 的 坛 上 献 燔 祭 和 平 安 祭 ， 又 在 耶 和 华 面 前 的 坛 上 烧 香 。 这 样 ， 他 建 造 殿 的 工 程 完 毕 了 。 [kjv] And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished the house. [bbe] Three times in the year it was Solomon\u0027s way to give burned offerings and peace-offerings on the altar he had made to the Lord, causing his fire-offering to go up on the altar before the Lord. 9:26 [hgb] 所 罗 门 王 在 以 东 地 红 海 边 ， 靠 近 以 禄 的 以 旬 迦 别 制 造 船 只 。 [kjv] And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom. [bbe] And King Solomon made a sea-force of ships in Ezion-geber, by Eloth, on the Red Sea, in the land of Edom. 9:27 [hgb] 希 兰 差 遣 他 的 仆 人 ， 就 是 熟 悉 泛 海 的 船 家 ， 与 所 罗 门 的 仆 人 一 同 坐 船 航 海 。 [kjv] And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon. [bbe] Hiram sent his servants, who were experienced seamen, in the sea-force with Solomon\u0027s men. 9:28 [hgb] 他 们 到 了 俄 斐 ， 从 那 里 得 了 四 百 二 十 他 连 得 金 子 ， 运 到 所 罗 门 王 那 里 。 [kjv] And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon. [bbe] And they came to Ophir, where they got four hundred and twenty talents of gold, and took it back to King Solomon.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/107/1542.html","bookId":187,"book":{"id":187,"title":"Kings列王记上","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 大 卫 王 年 纪 老 迈 ， 虽 用 被 遮 盖 ， 仍 不 觉 暖 。 [kjv] Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat. ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/107","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
