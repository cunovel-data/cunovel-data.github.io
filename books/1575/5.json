{"id":110325,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"The cafeteria of Three Counties Hospital was a traditional meeting place for most of the hospital grapevine, its stems and branches extending tenuously to every section and department within Three Counties\u0027 walls. Few events occurred in the hospital - promotions, scandals, firings, and hirings - which were not known and discussed in the cafeteria long before official word was ever published.\n Medical staff frequently used the cafeteria for \"curbstone consultations\" with colleagues whom they seldom saw except at a meal or coffee break. Indeed, a good deal of serious medical business was transacted over its tables, and weighty specialist opinions, which at other times would be followed by a substantial bill, were often tossed out freely, sometimes to the great advantage of a patient who, recovering later from some ailment which at first had proven troublesome, would never suspect the somewhat casual channels through which his eventual course of treatment had come.\n There were exceptions. A few staff physicians now and then resented this informal use of their arduously acquired tal��nts and resisted attempts by colleagues to draw them out in the discussion of specific cases. In such instances the usual rejoinder was, \"I think we\u0027d better set up a consultation in my office. I\u0027ll have the meter running then.\"\n Gil Bartlett was one who disapproved of such approaches and at times could be a good deal blunter in refusing off-the-cuff opinions. One story told about his personal tactics of resistance had its origin not in the cafeteria but at a cocktail party in a private home. His hostess, a grand dame of Burlington society, had buttonholed Bartlett and bombarded him with questions about her illnesses, real and imagined. Bartlett had listened for a while, then announced in a loud voice which brought a hush to the crowded room, \"Madam, I believe from what you say you have a menstrual problem. If you\u0027ll strip right now I\u0027ll examine you here.\"\n Mostly though, much as they might resist informal consultations outside the hospital, the medical staff accepted the cafeteria exchanges on the basis that they had as much to gain as lose; and a good many physicians around the hospital used the mildewed quip on leaving their contact points, \"If you want me I\u0027ll be in my second office.\" Normally no further explanation was required or given.\n Generally the cafeteria was a democratic area where hospital rank, if not forgotten, was at least temporarily ignored. An exception, possibly, was the practice of setting aside a group of tables for the medical staff. Mrs. Straughan, the chief dietitian, hovered over this area periodically, knowing that even minor shortcomings in hygiene or service could bring testy complaints at some future meeting of the hospital\u0027s medical board.\n With few exceptions the senior attending physicians used the reserved tables. House staff, however, were less consistent, residents and interns sometimes asserting their independence by joining the nurses or other groups. There was nothing unusual, therefore, in Mike Seddons dropping into a chair opposite Vivian Loburton who, released from an assignment earlier than some of her fellow student nurses, was eating lunch alone.\n Since they had met ten days ago in the autopsy room, Vivian had encountered Mike Seddons several times in the hospital and on each occasion - seeing his thatch of red hair and wall-to-wall grin - she had increasingly come to like the look of him. Intuitively she had expected that soon he might make a direct approach to her, and now here it was.\n \"Hi!\" Seddons said.\n \"Hullo.\" The greeting came out awkwardly, Vivian having just bitten, with healthy appetite, into a chicken leg. She pointed to her mouth and mumbled, \"Excuse me.\"\n \"That\u0027s perfectly all right,\" Seddons said. \"Take your time. I\u0027m here to proposition you.\"\n She finished the mouthful of chicken, then said, \"I thought that was supposed to come later.\"\n Mike Seddons grinned. \"Haven\u0027t you heard? - this is the jet age. No time for formal frills. Here\u0027s my proposition: theater the day after tomorrow, preceded by dinner at the Cuban Grill.\"\n Vivian asked curiously, \"Can you afford it?\" Among house staff and student nurses poverty was a time-honored, rueful joke.\n Seddons lowered his voice to a stage whisper. \"Don\u0027t tell a soul, but I\u0027m on to a side line. Those patients we get in autopsy. A lot of \u0027em have gold fillings in their teeth. It\u0027s a very simple matter . . .\"\n \"Oh, shut up; you\u0027ll ruin my lunch.\" She bit the chicken leg again, and Seddons reached over for two of her trench fries.\n He savored them. \"Um, not bad. I must eat more often. Now here\u0027s the story.\" He produced two tickets from his pocket and a printed voucher. \"Take a look at this - compliments of a grateful patient.\" The tickets were for the road show of a Broadway musical. The voucher covered dinner for two at the Cuban Grill.\n \"What did you do?\" Vivian was frankly curious. \"Heart surgery?\"\n \"No. Last week I filled in for half an hour for Frank Worth in emergency. A guy had a bad gash on his hand and I stitched it. Next thing I knew, these were in the mail.\" He chuckled. \"Worth is furious, of course. Says he\u0027ll never leave his post again. Well, will you come?\"\n \"I\u0027d love to,\" Vivian said, and meant it.\n \"Great! I\u0027ll pick you up at the nurses\u0027 residence at seven o\u0027clock. Okay?\" As he spoke Mike Seddons found himself regarding this girl with even greater interest. He was suddenly aware that she had a good deal more than a pretty face and a good figure. When she looked at him and smiled it conveyed the feeling of something warm and fragrant. He thought: I wish we were meeting today instead of the day after tomorrow; it\u0027s a long time to wait. Then a faint warning voice inside him cautioned: Beware entanglements! Remember the Seddons policy: love \u0027em and leave \u0027em - happy with their memories; parting is such sweet sorrow but, oh, so very practical for staying unattached.\n \"Okay,\" Vivian said. \"I might be a little late but not much.\"\n A week and a half had passed since Harry Tomaselli had told O\u0027Donnell that construction of the hospital\u0027s extension was planned to begin in the spring. Now, in the administrator\u0027s office, he, Kent O\u0027Donnell, and Orden Brown, the board chairman, were meeting to discuss immediate things to be done.\n Months before, with an architect at their elbows, the three had worked over the detailed plans for each section which would have its home in the new wing. The wishes of heads of medical departments had had to be balanced against the money likely to be available. Orden Brown had been the arbiter with O\u0027Donnell as medical liaison. As always, the chairman had been crisp and incisive, but with a humor that seasoned his basic toughness. Sometimes they had gone along entirely with what was asked; at other times, when they suspected empire building for its own sake, the inquiries had been more searching.\n One section head, the chief pharmacist, had pressed hard to have a private toilet included in his own office design. When the architect had pointed out that more general facilities were available a mere forty feet down the corridor, the pharmacist had gone so far as to observe that forty feet was a long way when he was suffering one of his periodic attacks of diarrhea. Orden Brown had dryly referred him to the department of internal medicine.\n A few worth-while projects had had to be vetoed solely on the grounds of cost. Ding Dong Bell, the senior radiologist, had made out a convincing case for creation of a cine-radiography unit - its purpose to improve diagnosis and treatment of heart disease. But on learning that the equipment alone would cost fifty thousand dollars the plan had regretfully been ruled out.\n But now, with the main planning completed, the focus of attention was on the practical matter of getting the money. Strictly speaking, this was the responsibility of the board of directors; but the medical staff was expected to help.\n Orden Brown said, \"We\u0027re suggesting some quotas for the doctors - six thousand dollars for senior attending physicians, four thousand for associates, two thousand for assistants.\"\n O\u0027Donnell whistled softly. He told the chairman, \"I\u0027m afraid there\u0027ll be some complaining.\"\n Brown smiled. \"We must do our best to endure it.\"\n Harry Tomaselli put in, \"The money can be spread over four years, Kent. As long as we have written pledges we can use them to borrow from the bank.\"\n \"There\u0027s another thing,\" Brown said. \"When word gets around town that this is what the doctors themselves are giving, it will help our general fund raising a good deal.\"\n \"And you\u0027ll see that word does get around?\"\n Brown smiled. \"Naturally.\"\n O\u0027Donnell reflected that it would be his job to break the news at a medical staff meeting. He could visualize the pained expressions he would face. Most medical men he knew, like the majority of people nowadays, lived right up to their incomes. Of course, there would be no compulsion about the quotas, but it would be hard for an individual to take a stand against them, especially since the medical staff had a lot to gain from the hospital\u0027s growth. A good many certainly would give the full amount asked and, human nature being what it was, they would bring pressure on others to suffer equally. A hospital was a breeding ground for politics, and there were many ways in which a nonconformist could have life made difficult for him.\n Harry Tomaselli, intuitive as usual, said, \"Don\u0027t worry, Kent. I\u0027ll brief you thoroughly before the staff meeting. We\u0027ll have all the selling points lined up. In fact, when you\u0027re through some people may even want to exceed quota.\"\n \"Don\u0027t count on it.\" O\u0027Donnell smiled. \"You\u0027re about to touch a number of doctors on their tenderest nerve - the pocketbook.\"\n Tomaselli grinned back. He knew that when the chief of surgery made his appeal to the staff it would be as incisive and thorough as everything else O\u0027Donnell did. He reflected, not for the first time, how good it was to work with someone of O\u0027Donnell\u0027s character. In Tomaselli\u0027s last hospital, where he had been assistant administrator, the president of the medical board had been a man who courted popularity and trimmed his sails to every wind of opinion. As a result there had been no real leadership and hospital standards had suffered accordingly.\n Harry Tomaselli admired forthrightness and swift decisions, mostly because those were methods he used himself as administrator of Three Counties. With swift decisions you sometimes made mistakes, but on the whole you got a lot more done, and your average of hits unproved as time went on. Quickness - of speech and thought, as well as action - was something Harry Tomaselli had learned in courtrooms long before he ever thought of finding his destiny behind a hospital desk.\n He had entered law school from college and bad begun to lay the foundations of a good practice when war intervened. Anticipating the draft, he had enlisted in the U.S. Navy where he had received a commission and a job in medical administration. Later, as the navy hospitals filled with wounded, Lieutenant Tomaselli had proven himself an able administrator with an instinct for sensing the invisible border line between the practice of medicine and the business of hospital management.\n After the war, faced with the choice of returning to law or remaining in hospital work, he had chosen the latter and enrolled in the School of Hospital Administration at Columbia University. He had graduated from Columbia at a time when there was growing recognition of hospital administration as a specialized field of endeavor in which a medical degree was neither necessary nor particularly useful. This had opened up a brisk demand for good administrators, and after two years as an assistant he had accepted Orden Brown\u0027s offer of the top post at Three Counties.\n Now Harry Tomaselli was in love with his work. He shared Kent O\u0027Donnell\u0027s views about the standards of good medicine and respected the business acumen and caginess of the board chairman, Orden Brown. As administrator, it was Tomaselli\u0027s business to see that all hospital services - nursing, housekeeping, engineering, building, accounting, and their subsidiaries - measured up to the standards the other two men required.\n He did this by delegation - he had a happy faculty of appointing good department heads - and also by an intense personal interest in everything that went on within the hospital. Almost nothing of importance escaped Harry Tomaselli. Each day his short, stocky figure could be seen bustling along the corridors but pausing frequently while he talked with nurses, patients, janitors, clerks, cooks - anyone who could tell him something about the hospital or make a suggestion on how to run it better. New ideas excited him; his own enthusiasm engendered more in others. Sometimes, head thrust forward, eyes gleaming behind his big black-rimmed glasses, he would talk volubly, his thoughts moving at a gallop, his hands underscoring points as he made them.\n In all his peregrinations Harry Tomaselli seldom made a written note. His lawyer\u0027s training enabled him to carry assorted facts readily in his head. But after each inspection tour he fired off a barrage of staccato memoranda on all points, big and little, where he felt the administration of Three Counties could be improved.\n Yet, for all this, he had a diplomat\u0027s sense of tone and language that seldom gave offense. Verbally he would hand out a reprimand, then talk cheerfully of something else. And though he never wasted words, his written memos were always gracious. He hated to fire a hospital employee unless the provocation were really strong. He frequently told his department heads, \"If anyone has worked here more than a month, we have an investment in their experience. It\u0027s to our advantage to mold them if we can, rather than try for someone new who may have other faults we haven\u0027t thought of.\" Because this policy was known and respected, employee morale was high.\n There were still things about the organization that worried him. Some departments, he knew, could be made more efficient. There were areas where service to patients could be improved. A good deal of old equipment needed junking and replacement. There was newly developed equipment - the cine-radiography unit was an example - which, under ideal conditions, the hospital should have. The new building program would make good some of these deficiencies but not all. Like O\u0027Donnell, he knew there were years of work ahead and that some objectives perhaps would remain beyond reach. But, after all, that was the road to achievement; you always tried for a little more than you knew you could accomplish.\n His thoughts were brought back to the present by Orden Brown. The chairman was telling O\u0027Donnell, \"There\u0027ll be a good deal of social activity, of course, once the campaign gets going. Oh, and something else. I believe it would be a good thing, Kent, if we put you in as a speaker at the Rotary Club. You could tell them what the new building will do, our plans for the future, and so on.\"\n O\u0027Donnell, who disliked public meetings, especially the regimented bonhomie of service clubs, had been about to grimace but checked himself. Instead he said, \"If you think it will help.\"\n \"One of my people is on Rotary executive,\" Orden Brown said. \"I\u0027ll have him fix it up. That had better be the opening week of the campaign. Then the following week we might do the same thing with Kiwanis.\"\n O\u0027Donnell considered suggesting that the chairman leave him some time for surgery, otherwise he might have trouble meeting his own quota. But he thought better of it.\n \"By the way,\" Orden Brown was saying, \"are you free for dinner the day after tomorrow?\"\n \"Yes, I am,\" O\u0027Donnell answered promptly. He always enjoyed the quiet, formal dignity of dinner at the house on the hill.\n \"I\u0027d like you to come with me to Eustace Swayne\u0027s.\" Seeing O\u0027Donnell\u0027s surprise, the chairman added, \"It\u0027s all right - you\u0027re invited. He asked me if I\u0027d tell you.\"\n \"Yes, I\u0027ll be glad to come.\" All the same, the invitation to the home of the board of directors\u0027 most die-hard member was unexpected. Naturally O\u0027Donnell had met Swayne a few times but had not come to know him well.\n \"As a matter of fact, it\u0027s my suggestion,\" Brown said. \"I\u0027d like you to talk with him about the hospital generally. Let him absorb some of your ideas if you can. Frankly, at times he\u0027s a problem on the board, but you know that, of course.\"\n \"I\u0027ll do what I can.\" Now that he knew what was involved, O\u0027Donnell did not relish the thought of getting close to board politics. So far he had managed to steer clear of them. But he could not say no to Orden Brown.\n The chairman picked up his brief case and prepared to leave. Tomaselli and O\u0027Donnell rose with him.\n \"It will be just a small party,\" Orden Brown said. \"Probably half a dozen people. Why don\u0027t we pick you up on the way across town? I\u0027ll phone before we leave.\"\n O\u0027Donnell murmured his thanks as, nodding pleasantly, the chairman went out.\n The door had scarcely closed on Orden Brown when tall, slim Kathy Cohen, Tomaselli\u0027s secretary, came in. \"I\u0027m sorry to interrupt,\" she said.\n \"What is it, Kathy?\"\n She told the administrator, \"There\u0027s a man on the phone who insists on talking to you. A Mr. Bryan.\"\n \"I\u0027m busy with Dr. O\u0027Donnell now. I\u0027ll call him back.\" Tomaselli sounded surprised. Normally he would not have to tell Kathy anything so elementary.\n \"I told him that, Mr. Tomaselli.\" She sounded doubtful. \"But he\u0027s very insistent. He says he\u0027s the husband of a patient. I thought you ought to know.\"\n \"Maybe you should talk with him, Harry.\" O\u0027Donnell smiled at the girl. \"Take him off Kathy\u0027s mind. I don\u0027t mind waiting.\"\n \"All right.\" The administrator reached for one of his two telephones.\n \"It\u0027s line four.\" The girl waited until the connection was made, then went back to the outer office.\n \"Administrator speaking.\" Tomaselli\u0027s tone was friendly. Then he frowned slightly, listening to what was coming from the other end of the line.\n O\u0027Donnell could hear the receiver diaphragm rattling sharply. He caught the words, \"Disgraceful situation . . . imposition on a family . . . should be an inquiry.\"\n Tomaselli put his hand over the phone\u0027s mouthpiece. He told O\u0027Donnell, \"He\u0027s really boiling. Something about his wife. I can\u0027t quite make put . . .\" He listened for a moment more, then said, \"Now, Mr. Bryan, supposing you start at the beginning. Tell me what this is all about.\" He reached for a pad and pencil, then said, \"Yes, sir.\" A pause. \"Now tell me, please, when was your wife admitted to hospital?\" The phone rattled again and the administrator made a swift note. \"And who was your physician?\" Again a note. \"And the date of discharge?\" A pause. \"Yes, I see.\"\n O\u0027Donnell heard the words, \"Can\u0027t get any satisfaction,\" then Tomaselli was talking again.\n \"No, Mr. Bryan, I don\u0027t remember the particular case. But I will make some inquiries. I promise you that.\" He listened, then answered, \"Yes, sir, I do know what a hospital bill means to a family. But the hospital doesn\u0027t make any profit, you know.\"\n O\u0027Donnell could still hear the voice on the telephone, but it sounded calmer, responding to Tomaselli\u0027s conciliatory approach. Now the administrator said, \"Well, sir, it\u0027s the physician who decides how long a patient remains in hospital. I think you should have another talk with your wife\u0027s physician, and what I\u0027ll do meanwhile is have our treasurer go over your bill, item by item.\" He listened briefly, then, \"Thank you, Mr. Bryan. Good-by.\"\n He hung up the phone, tore off the page of notes, and put it in a tray marked \"Dictation.\"\n \"What was the trouble?\" O\u0027Donnell asked the question casually. In a busy hospital complaints about service and charges were not unique.\n \"He claims his wife was kept in too long. Now he has to go into debt to pay the bill.\"\n O\u0027Donnell said sharply, \"How does he know she was in too long?\"\n \"He says he\u0027s checked around - whatever that means.\" Tomaselli said thoughtfully, \"It may have been necessary, of course, but she was here nearly three weeks.\"\n \"So?\"\n \"Normally I wouldn\u0027t think much about it. But we\u0027ve had an unusual number of these complaints. They\u0027re not always as strong as this - but on the same lines.\"\n Something flashed through O\u0027Donnell\u0027s mind: the word Pathology. Aloud he said: \"Who was the attending physician?\"\n Tomaselli glanced at his notes. \"Reubens.\"\n \"Let\u0027s see if we can get him and clear this up now.\"\n Tomaselli touched an intercom set. \"Kathy,\" he said, \"see if you can locate Dr. Reubens.\"\n They waited in silence. From the corridor outside they could hear a soft voice on the hospital public-address system. \"Dr. Reubens. Dr. Reubens.\" After a moment the phone buzzed. Tomaselli lifted the receiver and listened. Then he passed it to O\u0027Donnell.\n \"Reub? It\u0027s Kent O\u0027Donnell.\"\n \"What can I do for you?\" O\u0027Donnell could hear the thin, precise voice of Reubens, one of the senior surgeons, at the other end of the line.\n \"Do you have a patient\" - he looked at Tomaselli\u0027s notes which the administrator had pushed toward him - \"a Mrs. Bryan?\"\n \"That\u0027s right. What\u0027s the matter? Has her husband been complaining?\"\n \"You know about it then?\"\n \"Of course I know about it.\" Reubens sounded annoyed. \"Personally I think he has good reason to complain.\"\n \"What\u0027s the story, Reub?\"\n \"The story is that I admitted Mrs. Bryan for possible carcinoma of the breast. I removed a tumor. It turned out to be benign.\"\n \"Then why keep her here for three weeks?\" As he asked, O\u0027Donnell remembered that you always had to go through this question-and-answer performance with Reubens. The other man seldom volunteered information.\n Now he answered, \"You\u0027d better ask Joe Pearson that!\"\n \"Be simpler if you told me, Reub.\" O\u0027Donnell was quietly insistent. \"After all, she\u0027s your patient.\"\n There was a silence. Then the thin, clipped voice said, \"All right. I told you the tumor was benign. But it was two and a half weeks before I found out. That\u0027s how long it took Pearson to get it under his microscope.\"\n \"Did you remind him about it?\"\n \"If I called him once I called him half a dozen times. He\u0027d probably have been longer if I hadn\u0027t kept after it.\"\n \"And that\u0027s why you kept Mrs. Bryan in - for three weeks?\"\n \"Naturally.\" The voice on the phone took on a note of sarcasm. \"Or are you suggesting I should have discharged her?\"\n There was reason for Reubens to be sour on the subject, O\u0027Donnell thought. Unquestionably he had been put in a difficult position. If he had discharged the patient, he might have had to call her back for more surgery, as had happened to Bill Rufus. On the other hand, every additional day in hospital meant an extra financial burden for the family. He answered noncommittally, \"I\u0027m not suggesting anything, Reub. Just making some inquiries.\"\n The thing had obviously been on Reubens\u0027 mind. \"Then you\u0027d better talk to some of the other men,\" he said. \"I\u0027m not the only one this has happened to. You know about Bill Rufus?\"\n \"Yes, I know. Frankly, I thought things had been improving a little.\"\n \"If they have, it\u0027s not so\u0027s you\u0027d notice it. What do you propose to do about Bryan\u0027s bill?\"\n \"I doubt if we can do anything. After all, his wife was here for three weeks. Hospital money is tight, you know.\" O\u0027Donnell wondered what Reubens\u0027 reaction would be when he heard he was being asked to give six thousand dollars himself to the hospital building fund.\n \"It\u0027s too bad. Husband\u0027s a decent little guy - a carpenter or something like that, works for himself. He didn\u0027t have any insurance. This\u0027ll set \u0027em back for a long time.\" O\u0027Donnell made no answer. His mind was already running ahead, thinking of what came next. Again the thin voice on the phone: \"Well, is that all?\"\n \"Yes, Reub; that\u0027s all. Thanks.\" He handed the telephone back to Harry Tomaselli.\n \"Harry, I want a meeting this afternoon.\" O\u0027Donnell had made up his mind what had to be done. \"Let\u0027s try to get half a dozen of the senior people on staff. We\u0027ll meet here, if that\u0027s convenient, and I\u0027d like you to be here too.\"\n Tomaselli nodded. \"Can do.\"\n O\u0027Donnell was checking over names in his mind. \"We\u0027ll want Harvey Chandler, of course, as chief of medicine. Better have Bill Rufus, and Reubens should be included, I think.\" He paused. \"Oh yes, and Charlie Dornberger. He might be useful. How many is that?\"\n The administrator checked the names he had written. \"Six with you and me. How about Lucy Grainger?\"\n Briefly O\u0027Donnell hesitated. Then he said, \"All right. Let\u0027s make it seven then.\"\n \"Agenda?\" Tomaselli had his pencil poised.\n O\u0027Donnell shook his head. \"We won\u0027t need one. There\u0027s just one subject - changes in Pathology.\"\n When the administrator had mentioned Lucy Grainger\u0027s name, O\u0027Donnell had hesitated for one reason only: it had reminded him of a meeting between himself and Lucy the night before.\n They had met for dinner - the outcome of O\u0027Donnell\u0027s invitation to Lucy the day of the mortality conference - and in the Palm Court of the Roosevelt Hotel they had had cocktails, then a leisurely meal. It had been a pleasant, relaxed occasion, and they had talked lightly of themselves, of people they had known, and their own experiences in and out of medicine.\n Afterward O\u0027Donnell had driven Lucy home. She had recently moved into Benvenuto Grange, a large, fashionable apartment block on the north side of town. She had said, \"You\u0027ll come in for a nightcap, of course?\"\n He had left his car for the uniformed doorman to park and followed her. They rode the gleaming, silent elevator to the fifth floor, then turned down a birch-paneled corridor, their footsteps silenced in deep broadloom. He had raised his eyebrows and Lucy smiled. \"It is a little awesome, isn\u0027t it? I\u0027m still impressed myself.\"\n She had used her key to open a door and inside touched a switch. Tasteful, subdued lighting sprang up around an elegant interior lounge. He could see the partly opened door of a bedroom directly ahead. \"I\u0027ll mix us a drink,\" she said.\n Her back was to him. Ice clinked in glasses. O\u0027Donnell said, \"Lucy, you\u0027ve never married?\"\n \"No.\" She had answered without turning.\n He said softly, \"I\u0027ve sometimes wondered why.\"\n \"It\u0027s very simple really. It\u0027s quite some time since I was asked.\" Lucy turned, carrying the drinks she had mixed. She gave O\u0027Donnell his, then moved to a chair. She said thoughtfully, \"Now I think of it, there was only one occasion - at least, only one that mattered. I was a good deal younger then.\"\n O\u0027Donnell sipped his drink. \"And your answer was \u0027no\u0027?\"\n \"I wanted a career in medicine. At the time it seemed terribly important. That and marriage didn\u0027t seem to go together.\"\n He asked casually, \"Any regrets?\"\n Lucy considered. \"Not really, I suppose. I\u0027ve achieved what I wanted, and it\u0027s been rewarding in many ways. Oh, sometimes one wonders how things would have turned out with a different decision, but after all, that\u0027s human, isn\u0027t it?\"\n \"I suppose so.\" O\u0027Donnell was conscious of being strangely moved. There was a sense of depth and tenderness about Lucy, a feeling of peacefulness and coming home. She should have children, he thought. He had asked, \"Do you still feel the same way about marriage and medicine - for you, that is?\"\n \"I\u0027m no longer dogmatic about anything.\" She smiled. \"That, at least, I\u0027ve learned.\"\n O\u0027Donnell wondered what, from his own point of view, marriage to Lucy would be like. Would there be love and mellowness? Or had each of their careers gone parallel too far and too long for change and adjustment now. If married, how might they spend their hours of leisure? Would the talk be intimate and domestic? Or would it be of hospital affairs, with charts on the table at dinner and diagnostic problems for dessert? Would he perhaps, instead of gaining sanctuary, find merely another offshoot of medicine and his daily work. Aloud he said, \"I\u0027ve always thought, you know, that we have a good deal in common.\"\n \"Yes, Kent,\" Lucy answered, \"so have I.\"\n O\u0027Donnell had finished his drink, then risen to leave. He realized they had both said a good deal more than had passed in words. Now he wanted time to think and to reason things through. Too much was involved for hasty decisions.\n \"There\u0027s really no need to go, Kent. Stay if you wish.\" Lucy had said it simply, and he knew if he stayed it would be up to him what happened next.\n Part of his mind had told him to remain, but caution and habit won out. He took her hands. \"Good night, Lucy. Let\u0027s think about all this.\"\n When the elevator doors had closed she was still standing at the open apartment door. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-final-diagnosis/page-5.html","bookId":1575,"book":{"id":1575,"title":"The Final Diagnosis","description":"Storyline: \n A look at the workings of a modern day hospital through the lens of the pathologists department.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-final-diagnosis.jpg","author":"Arthur Hailey","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-final-diagnosis.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:57:00 PM"}}
