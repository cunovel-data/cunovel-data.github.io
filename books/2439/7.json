{"id":79117,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"Evra was watching TV when I got in. \"Any news?\" I asked. \"No,\" he replied. \"Mr. Crepsley didn\u0027t miss me?\" \"He barely noticed you were gone. He\u0027s been acting weird lately.\" \"I know,\" I said. \"I need a feed of human blood, but he hasn\u0027t mentioned it. Normally he\u0027s pretty fussy about making sure I feed on time.\" \"Are you going to feed without him?\" Evra asked. \"Probably. I\u0027ll slip into one of the rooms late tonight and take some blood from a sleeping guest. I\u0027ll use a syringe.\" I wasn\u0027t able to close cuts with spit like full vampires could. I\u0027d come a long way in a year. Not so long ago, I would have jumped at the chance to skip a feed; now I was feeding because I wanted to, not because I\u0027d been told. \"You\u0027d better be careful,\" Evra warned me. \"If you get caught, Mr. Crepsley will have a fit.\" \"Caught? Me? Impossible! I\u0027ll breeze in and out like a ghost.\" I did, too, at about two in the morning. It was easy for someone with my talents: by sticking an ear to a door and listening for sounds inside, I could tell how many people were in a room and whether they were light sleepers or deep sleepers. When I found an unlocked room with a single man snoring like a bear, I let myself in and took the required amount of blood. Back in my own room, I squeezed the blood into a glass and drank. \"That\u0027ll keep me going,\" I said as I finished. \"It\u0027ll get me through tomorrow anyway, and that\u0027s the important thing.\" \"What\u0027s so special about tomorrow?\" Evra asked. I told him about meeting Debbie and arranging to go to the movies. \"You\u0027ve got a date!\" Evra laughed with delight. \"It\u0027s not a date!\" I snorted. \"We\u0027re just going to the movies.\" \" Just?\" Evra grinned. \"There\u0027s no such thing as just with girls. It\u0027s a date.\" \"Okay,\" I said, \"it\u0027s kind of a date. I\u0027m not stupid. I know I can\u0027t get involved.\" \"Why not?\" Evra asked. \"Because she\u0027s a normal girl and I\u0027m only half human,\" I said. \"That shouldn\u0027t stop you from going out together. She won\u0027t be able to tell you\u0027re a vampire, not unless you start biting her neck.\" \"Ha ha,\" I laughed dryly. \"It\u0027s not that. In five years she\u0027ll be a grown woman, while I\u0027ll still be like this.\" Evra shook his head. \"Worry about the next five days,\" he advised, \"not the next five years. You\u0027ve been hanging around Mr. Crepsley too much - you\u0027re getting as gloomy as he is. There\u0027s no reason for you not to date girls.\" \"I guess you\u0027re right.\" I sighed. \"Of course I am.\" I chewed my lip nervously. \"Assuming it is a date,\" I said, \"what do I do? I\u0027ve never been on a date before.\" Evra shrugged. \"Neither have I. But I guess you fust act normal. Chat with her. Tell her a few jokes. treat her like a friend. Then...\" \" Then?\" I asked when he stopped. He puckered up his lips. \"Give her a kiss!\" He laughed. I threw a pillow at him. \"I\u0027m sorry I told you,\" I grumbled. \"I\u0027m only kidding. But I\u0027ll tell you what.\" He turned serious. \" Don\u0027ttell Mr. Crepsley. He\u0027d probably move us on to a new city immediately, or at least a new hotel.\" \"You\u0027re right,\" I agreed. \"I\u0027ll keep quiet about Debbie when he\u0027s around. It shouldn\u0027t be hard: I barely see him. And when I do, he hardly says anything. He seems like he\u0027s in a world of his own.\" Although I couldn\u0027t have known it then, it was a world me and Evra would soon be part of... and Debbie, too. The next day passed slowly. My stomach was a jumble of nerves. I had to drink warm milk to calm it down. Evra didn\u0027t help matters. He kept reading the time out loud and announcing: \"Five hours to go!\" \"Four hours to go!\" \"Three and a half...\" Luckily I didn\u0027t have clothes to worry about: I only had one outfit, so there was no problem choosing what to wear. But I did spend a couple of hours in the bathroom, checking that I was spotlessly clean. \"Calm down,\" Evra said eventually. \"You look great. I\u0027m half tempted to go out with you myself.\" \"Shut up, stupid,\" I shot back, but couldn\u0027t help grinning. \"Well, anyway,\" Evra said, \"do you want me to disappear before Debbie arrives?\" \"Why?\" I asked. \"You might not want me here,\" he muttered. \"I want to introduce you to her. She thinks you\u0027re my brother. It\u0027d look strange if you weren\u0027t here when she shows up.\" \"It\u0027s just - well - how will you explain?\" Evra asked. \"Explain what?\" \"My looks,\" he said, rubbing a few of the scales along his arm. \"Oh,\" I said, as it finally dawned on me. Debbie didn\u0027t know Evra was a snake-boy. She was expecting an ordinary boy. \"I might frighten her,\" Evra said. \"Lots of people get scared when they find themselves face to face with a guy like me. Maybe it would be for the best if -? \"Listen,\" I said firmly. \"You\u0027re my best friend, tight?\" \"Right.\" Evra smiled weakly. \"But -? \"No!\" I snapped. \"No buts. I like Debbie a lot, but if she can\u0027t handle the way you look, too bad.\" \"Thanks,\" Evra said quietly. Night came and Mr. Crepsley arose. The vampire looked haggard. I\u0027d fixed a meal for him - bacon, sausages, pork chops - so he\u0027d eat quickly and leave before Debbie arrived. \"Are you feeling all right?\" I asked as he wolfed down the food. \"Fine,\" he mumbled. \"You look terrible,\" I told him bluntly. \"Have you fed recently?\" He shook his head. \"I have not had time. I may tonight.\" \"I took blood from a guest last night,\" I said. \"It\u0027ll keep me going for another week or so.\" \"Good,\" he said absentmindedly. It was the first time I\u0027d fed by myself, and I\u0027d been expecting some sort of a compliment, but he didn\u0027t seem to care. It was like he\u0027d lost interest in me. I cleaned up once he\u0027d left, then sat down to watch TV with Evra and wait for Debbie. \"She\u0027s not going to come,\" I said after what felt like a couple of hours. \"She stood me up.\" \"Relax,\" Evra laughed. \"You\u0027ve only been sitting here ten minutes. It\u0027s still early.\" I checked my watch - he was right. \"I can\u0027t go through with this,\" I groaned. \"I\u0027ve never been out with a girl before. I\u0027ll mess it up. She\u0027ll think I\u0027m boring.\" \"Don\u0027t get so wound up,\" Evra said. \"You want to go out with her, and you are going out with her, so why worry?\" I started to answer him, but was interrupted by Debbie knocking on the door. Forgetting my nerves in a second, I jumped up to let her in.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tunnels-of-blood-the-saga-of-darren-shan-3/page-7.html","bookId":2439,"book":{"id":2439,"title":"Tunnels of Blood (The Saga of Darren Shan #3)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #3: Tunnels of Blood This story introduces Gavner Purl, a full vampire, an old friend of Mr. Crepsley.
