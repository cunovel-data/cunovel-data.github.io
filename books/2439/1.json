I know they\u0027re just animals - cows, pigs, sheep - but I keep thinking they\u0027re human.\n I take a careful step forward. Powerful overhead lights mean it\u0027s bright as day. I have to tread carefully. Hide behind the dead animals. Move slowly. The floor\u0027s slippery with water and blood, which makes progress even trickier.\n Ahead, I spot him... the vampire... Mr. Crepsley. He\u0027s moving as quietly as I am, eyes focused on the fat man a little way ahead.\n The fat man. He\u0027s why I\u0027m here in this ice-cold slaughterhouse. He\u0027s the human Mr. Crepsley intends to kill. He\u0027s the man I have to save.\n The fat man pauses and checks one of the hanging slabs of meat. His cheeks are chubby and red. He\u0027s wearing clear plastic gloves. He pats the dead animal - the squeaky noise of the hook as the carcass swings puts my teeth on edge - then begins whistling. He starts to walk again. Mr. Crepsley follows. So do I.\n Evra is somewhere far behind. I left him outside. No point in both of us risking our lives.\n I pick up speed, moving slowly closer. Neither knows I\u0027m here. If everything works out as planned, they won\u0027t know, not until Mr. Crepsley makes his move. Not until I\u0027m forced to act.\n The fat man stops again. Bends to examine something. I take a quick step back, afraid he\u0027ll spot me, but then I see Mr. Crepsley closing in. Damn! No time to hide. If this is the moment he\u0027s chosen to attack, I have to get nearer.\n I spring forward several feet, risking being heard. Luckily Mr. Crepsley is entirely focused on the fat man.\n I\u0027m only three or four feet behind the vampire now. I bring up the long butcher\u0027s knife that I\u0027ve been holding down by my side. My eyes are glued to Mr. Crepsley. I won\u0027t act until he does - I\u0027ll give him every chance to prove my terrible suspicions wrong - but the second I see him tensing to spring...\n I take a firmer grip on the knife. I\u0027ve been practicing my swipe all day. I know the exact point I want to hit. One quick cut across Mr. Crepsley\u0027s throat and that\u0027ll be that. No more vampire. One more carcass to add to the pile.\n Long seconds slip by. I don\u0027t dare look to see what the fat man is studying. Is he ever going to rise?\n Then it happens. The fat man struggles to his feet. Mr. Crepsley hisses. He gets ready to lunge. I position the knife and steady my nerves. The fat man\u0027s on his feet now. He hears something. Looks up at the ceiling - wrong way, idiot! - as Mr. Crepsley leaps. As the vampire jumps, so do I, screeching loudly, slashing at him with the knife, determined to kill... \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tunnels-of-blood-the-saga-of-darren-shan-3/page-1.html","bookId":2439,"book":{"id":2439,"title":"Tunnels of Blood (The Saga of Darren Shan #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The Saga of Darren Shan #3: Tunnels of Blood \n This story introduces Gavner Purl, a full vampire, an old friend of Mr. Crepsley.
