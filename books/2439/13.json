{"id":79123,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"I didn\u0027t realize at first that Mr. Crepsley was following someone. He was hovering above a busy shopping street, where he\u0027d been for almost an hour, studying the shoppers. Then, without warning, he climbed to the top of the building he\u0027d been clinging to and started across the roof.\\n\\n I called Evra. He never called me, for fear the vampire would hear my phone. \"He\u0027s on the move again,\" I said quietly.\\n\\n \"About time,\" Evra grumbled. \"I hate it when he stops. You don\u0027t know how cold it gets, standing still down here.\"\\n\\n \"Go get something to eat,\" I told him. \"He\u0027s moving pretty slowly. I think you can take five or ten minutes off.\"\\n\\n \"Are you sure?\" Evra asked.\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll call you if anything happens.\"\\n\\n \"Okay,\" Evra said. \"I\u0027d love a hot dog and a cup of hot chocolate. You want me to pick something up for you?\"\\n\\n \"No thanks,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll keep in touch. See you soon.\" I hit the off switch and started after the vampire.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t like eating stuff like hot dogs, burgers, or French fries while tracking Mr. Crepsley: his nose could easily detect such strong scents. I ate dry slices of bread - which produced almost no smell - to keep my hunger down. I had ordinary tap water in a bottle to drink.\\n\\n After a couple of minutes I got curious. The other nights, he\u0027d either stayed in one spot or wandered around without direction. He was moving with purpose this time.\\n\\n I decided to get closer. It was dangerous, especially since he wasn\u0027t rushing - he was more likely to spot me - but I had to see what he was up to.\\n\\n Closing the gap by a third - as near to him as I dared get - I saw that he was sticking his head out over the edge of the roof, keeping a watch on the street below.\\n\\n Looking down at the well-lit street, I couldn\u0027t spot who he was after. It was only when he paused above a lamp that I noticed the fat man at the base, adjusting his shoelaces.\\n\\n That was it! Mr. Crepsley was after the fat man! I knew by the way the vampire stared, waiting for him to tie his shoelaces and move on. When the fat man finally stood up and started walking again, sure enough, Mr. Crepsley followed.\\n\\n Taking a few steps back, I called Evra.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s up?\" he asked. I could hear him munching on his hot dog. There were voices in the background.\\n\\n \"Action,\" I said simply.\\n\\n \"Oh, hell!\" Evra gasped. I heard him dropping the hot dog and shuffling away from the people behind him, to a quieter spot. \"Are you sure?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Positive,\" I said. \"The prey has been sighted.\"\\n\\n \"Okay,\" Evra sighed. He sounded nervous. I didn\u0027t blame him - I was nervous, too. \"Okay,\" he said again. \"Give me your position.\"\\n\\n I read out the name of the street. \"But don\u0027t rush,\" I told him. \"They\u0027re moving slowly. Stay a couple of streets back. I don\u0027t want Mr. Crepsley spotting you.\"\\n\\n \" Idon\u0027t want him spotting me either!\" Evra snorted. \"Keep me up to date.\"\\n\\n \"Will do,\" I promised. Clicking off the phone, I started after the pursuing vampire.\\n\\n He trailed the fat man to a large building, which the human disappeared into. Mr. Crepsley waited half an hour, then slowly circled the building, checking on windows and doors. I trudged along behind, keeping my distance, ready to race after him if he entered.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t. Instead, when he was through examining the place, he went to a nearby rooftop, from where he had a perfect view of all the entrances, and sat down to wait.\\n\\n I told Evra what was happening.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s just sitting there?\" Evra asked.\\n\\n \"Sitting and watching,\" I confirmed.\\n\\n \"What sort of place is it?\"\\n\\n I\u0027d read the name on the walls while I was passing them, and seen in a couple of the windows, but I could have told Evra what went on in the building just by the foul smell of animal blood in the air.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a slaughterhouse,\" I whispered.\\n\\n There was a long pause. Then: \"Maybe he\u0027s just here for the animal blood,\" Evra suggested.\\n\\n \"No. He would have entered by now if that was the case. He didn\u0027t come for the animals. He came for the human.\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t know that,\" Evra said. \"Maybe he\u0027s waiting for it to close before going in.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027d have a long wait,\" I laughed. \"It stays open all night.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m coming up,\" Evra said. \"Don\u0027t move until I get there.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll move when Mr. Crepsley moves, whether you\u0027re here or not,\" I said, but Evra had hung up and didn\u0027t hear me.\\n\\n He arrived a few minutes later, his breath stinking of mustard and onions. \"Dry bread for you from now on,\" I muttered.\\n\\n \"Do you think Mr. Crepsley will smell me?\" Evra asked. \"Maybe I should go back down and -?\\n\\n I shook my head. \"He\u0027s too close to the slaughterhouse,\" I said. \"The smell of blood will block everything else out.\"\\n\\n \"Where is he?\" Evra asked. I pointed the vampire out. Evra had to squint but eventually spotted him.\\n\\n \"We have to be extra quiet,\" I said. \"Even a small noise could have him swooping down on us.\"\\n\\n Evra shivered - whether because of the cold or the thought of being attacked, I don\u0027t know - and settled down. We said hardly anything to each other after that.\\n\\n We had to breathe into our cupped fists to stop our breath from showing. We would have been all right if it had been snowing - the snow would have hidden the smokelike tendrils - but it was a clear and frosty night.\\n\\n We sat there until three in the morning. Evra\u0027s teeth were chattering, and I was at the point of sending him home before he froze to death, when the fat man emerged. Mr. Crepsley started after him immediately.\\n\\n Too late, I realized the vampire was going to pass by us on his way back. There was no time to hide. He\u0027d see us!\\n\\n \"Keep perfectly still,\" I whispered to Evra. \"Don\u0027t even breathe.\"\\n\\n The vampire came toward us, walking steadily across the icy roofs in his bare feet. I was certain he\u0027d spot us, but his eyes were trained on the human. He passed within ten feet of us - his shadow crept over me like some awful ghost - and then he was gone.\\n\\n \"I think my heart stopped,\" Evra said shakily.\\n\\n I heard the familiar thump-thump sounds of the snake-boy\u0027s heart (it beat slightly slower than a normal human\u0027s) and smiled. \"You\u0027re okay,\" I told him.\\n\\n \"I thought we were done for,\" Evra hissed.\\n\\n \"Me, too.\" I stood and checked which way the vampire was going. \"You\u0027d better slip back down to the street,\" I told Evra.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s not going fast,\" Evra said. \"I can keep up.\"\\n\\n I shook my head. \"There\u0027s no telling when he\u0027ll speed up: the man might get in a cab or have a car waiting for him. Besides, after our narrow escape, it\u0027s better we split: that way, if one of us gets caught, the other can sneak back to the hotel and pretend he wasn\u0027t involved.\"\\n\\n Evra saw the sense in that and went down the nearest fire escape. I began following the tracks of the vampire and the fat man.\\n\\n He walked back the way he\u0027d come, past the deserted street where we first picked him up, on to a block of apartments.\\n\\n He lived in one of the central apartments on the sixth floor. Mr. Crepsley waited for the lights to go off inside, then went up in the elevator. I ran up the stairs and watched from the far end of the landing.\\n\\n I expected him to open the door and enter - locks were no problem for the vampire - but all he did was check the door and windows. Then he turned around and went back to the elevator.\\n\\n I hurried down the stairs and got the vampire back in view as he walked away from the apartments. I told Evra what had happened and where the vampire was heading. A few minutes later he caught up with me and we followed Mr. Crepsley as he jogged through the streets.\\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t he go in?\" Evra asked.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"Maybe there was somebody else there. Or maybe he plans to come back later.\\n\\n One thing\u0027s for sure: he didn\u0027t go up there to send a letter!\"\\n\\n After a while, we turned a corner into an alley and spotted Mr. Crepsley bent over a motionless woman. Evra gasped and started forward. I caught his arm and yanked him back.\\n\\n \" What are you doing?\" he hissed. \"Didn\u0027t you see? He\u0027s attacking! We have to stop him before -?\\n\\n \"It\u0027s okay,\" I said. \"He isn\u0027t attacking. He\u0027s feeding.\"\\n\\n Evra\u0027s struggles stopped. \"You\u0027re sure?\" he asked suspiciously.\\n\\n I nodded. \"He\u0027s drinking from the woman\u0027s arm. The corpses in the building had their throats cut, remember?\"\\n\\n Evra nodded uncertainly. \"If you\u0027re wrong...\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not,\" I assured him.\\n\\n Minutes later, the vampire moved on, leaving the woman behind. We hurried down the alley to check. As I\u0027d guessed, she was unconscious but alive, a small, fresh scar on her left arm the only sign that she had been feasted upon.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s go,\" I said, standing. \"She\u0027ll wake up in a few minutes. We\u0027d better not be here when she does.\"\\n\\n \"What about Mr. Crepsley?\" Evra asked.\\n\\n I looked up at the sky, estimating how long was left until dawn. \"He won\u0027t kill anyone tonight,\" I said. \"It\u0027s too late. He\u0027s probably heading back for the hotel. Come on - if we don\u0027t get back before him, we\u0027ll have a hell of a time trying to explain where we were.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tunnels-of-blood-the-saga-of-darren-shan-3/page-13.html","bookId":2439,"book":{"id":2439,"title":"Tunnels of Blood (The Saga of Darren Shan #3)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #3: Tunnels of Blood \\n This story introduces Gavner Purl, a full vampire, an old friend of Mr. Crepsley.
