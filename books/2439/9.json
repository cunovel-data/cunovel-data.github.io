Their names were Jesse and Donna - they wouldn\u0027t let me call them Mr. and Mrs. Hemlock - and they made me feel welcome as soon as I walked in.\\n\\n \"Hello!\" Jesse said, seeing me first as we entered the living room. \"Who\u0027s this?\"\\n\\n \"Mom, Dad, this is Darren,\" Debbie said. \"He\u0027s a friend of Anne\u0027s. I ran into him at the movies and invited him back. Is that okay?\"\\n\\n \"Sure,\" Jesse said.\\n\\n \"Of course,\" Donna agreed. \"We were about to have supper. Would you like some, Darren?\"\\n\\n \"If it\u0027s no trouble,\" I said.\\n\\n \"No trouble at all,\" she beamed. \"Do you like meatloaf?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s my favorite,\" I told her. It wasn\u0027t really, but I guessed it would pay to be polite.\\n\\n I told Jesse and Donna a little about myself as we ate.\\n\\n \"What about school?\" Jesse asked, like Debbie had before him.\\n\\n \"My dad used to be a teacher,\" I lied, having given some thought to the matter since yesterday. \"He teaches Evra and me.\"\\n\\n \"More meatloaf, Darren?\" Donna asked.\\n\\n \"Yes, please,\" I said. \"It\u0027s great.\" It was, too. Much better than any meatloaf I\u0027d had before. \"What\u0027s in it?\"\\n\\n \"A few extra spices,\" Donna said, smiling proudly. \"I used to be a chef.\"\\n\\n \"I wish they had someone like you in the hotel.\" I sighed. \"Their food isn\u0027t very good.\"\\n\\n I offered to wash the dishes when we were finished, but Jesse said he\u0027d do them. \"It\u0027s my way of unwinding at the end of a hard day,\" he explained. \"Nothing I like better than scrubbing a few dirty dishes, polishing the banister and vacuuming the carpets.\"\\n\\n \"Is he kidding?\" I asked Debbie.\\n\\n \"Actually, no,\" she said. \"Okay if we go up to my room?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"Go ahead,\" Donna told her. \"But don\u0027t chat for too long. We\u0027ve got a couple of chapters of The Three Musketeers to finish, remember?\"\\n\\n Debbie made a face. \"All for one and one for all,\" she groaned. \"How exciting - I don\u0027t think!\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t likeThe Three Musketeers?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Do you?\"\\n\\n \"Sure. I\u0027ve seen the movie at least eight times.\"\\n\\n \"But did you ever read the book?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"No, but I read a comic book about them once.\"\\n\\n Debbie shared a scornful glance with her mother, and the two burst out laughing.\\n\\n \"I have to read a little of a so-called classic every night,\" Debbie grumbled. \"I hope you never learn just how boring those books can be.\"\\n\\n \"Be down soon,\" she told her mother, then showed me the way upstairs.\\n\\n Her room was on the third floor. A big, pretty-empty room, with large closets and hardly any posters or decorations.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like feeling cluttered,\" Debbie explained when she saw me looking around.\\n\\n There was a bare artificial Christmas tree in one corner of the room. There had been one in the living room, too, and I noticed a couple more in other rooms on my way up the stairs.\\n\\n \"Why all the trees?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Dad\u0027s idea,\" Debbie said. \"He loves Christmas trees, so we get one for every room in the house. The ornaments are in little boxes underneath\" - she pointed to a box under the tree - \"and we open them on Christmas Eve and decorate the trees. It\u0027s a nice way to pass the night, and it tires you out, so you fall asleep almost as soon as your head hits the pillows.\"\\n\\n \"It sounds like fun,\" I agreed wistfully, remembering what it had been like to decorate the Christmas tree at home with my family.\\n\\n Debbie studied me silently. \"You could come over on Christmas Eve,\" she said. \"You and Evra. Your dad, too. You could help us with the trees.\"\\n\\n I stared at her. \"You mean that?\"\\n\\n \"Sure. I\u0027d have to check with Mom and Dad first, but I doubt if they\u0027d mind. We\u0027ve had friends over to help before. It\u0027s nicer with more people.\"\\n\\n I was happy that she\u0027d asked me, but I hesitated before accepting.\\n\\n \"Should I ask them?\" she said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure if I\u0027ll still be here at Christmas. Mr. Cre - Dad is unpredictable. He goes wherever the job takes him, whenever.\"\\n\\n \"Well, the offer\u0027s there,\" she said. \"If you\u0027re here, great. If not,\" - she shrugged - \"we\u0027ll manage by ourselves.\"\\n\\n We got talking about Christmas presents. \"Are you going to get the CD player for Evra?\" Debbie asked.\\n\\n \"Yeah. And a few CDs, too.\"\\n\\n \"That just leaves your dad,\" she said. \"What are you getting him?\"\\n\\n I thought about Mr. Crepsley and what he might like. I wasn\u0027t going to buy him anything - he\u0027d only turn up his nose at presents - but it was interesting to consider what I could buy him. What was there that a vampire could possibly be interested in?\\n\\n I started to smile. \"I know,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll get him a sun lamp.\"\\n\\n \"A sun lamp?\" Debbie frowned.\\n\\n \"So he can work up a tan.\" I began to laugh. \"He\u0027s pretty pale. He doesn\u0027t get much sun.\"\\n\\n Debbie couldn\u0027t understand why I was laughing so hard. I would have liked to let her in on the joke - it would be worth buying the sun lamp just to see the disgusted expression on the vampire\u0027s face - but didn\u0027t dare.\\n\\n \"You have a weird sense of humor,\" she muttered, bewildered.\\n\\n \"Trust me,\" I said, \"if you knew my dad, you\u0027d know why I was laughing.\" I was going to tell Evra about my idea when I got home: he\u0027d be able to appreciate it.\\n\\n We chatted for another hour or so. Then it was time for me to go.\\n\\n \"Well?\" Debbie said, as I stood up. \"Don\u0027t I get a good-night kiss?\"\\n\\n I thought I was going to collapse.\\n\\n \"I... um... I mean... that is...\" I became a stuttering wreck.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you want to kiss me?\" Debbie asked.\\n\\n \"Yes!\" I gasped quickly. \"It\u0027s just... I... um...\"\\n\\n \"Hey, forget it,\" Debbie said, shrugging. \"I don\u0027t care one way or the other.\" She got up. \"I\u0027ll show you out.\"\\n\\n We walked quickly down the stairs. I wanted to say goodbye to Jesse and Donna, but Debbie didn\u0027t give me the chance. She went straight to the front door and opened it. I was still trying to get back into my coat.\\n\\n \"Can I come over tomorrow?\" I asked, struggling to find the left arm of the coat.\\n\\n \"Sure, if you want to,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Look, Debbie,\" I said, \"I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t kiss you. I\u0027m just -?\\n\\n \"Scared?\" she asked, smiling.\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" I admitted.\\n\\n She laughed. \"Okay,\" she said. \"You can come over tomorrow. I want you to. Only, next time be a little braver, okay?\" And she closed the door behind me. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tunnels-of-blood-the-saga-of-darren-shan-3/page-9.html","bookId":2439,"book":{"id":2439,"title":"Tunnels of Blood (The Saga of Darren Shan #3)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #3: Tunnels of Blood \\n This story introduces Gavner Purl, a full vampire, an old friend of Mr. Crepsley.
