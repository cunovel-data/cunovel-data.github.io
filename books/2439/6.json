{"id":79116,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"Debbie\u0027s last name was Hemlock, and she hated it.\\n\\n \"Imagine being named after a poisonous plant!\" she fumed.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not that bad,\" I said. \"I kind of like it.\"\\n\\n \"Shows what kind of taste you have,\" she scoffed.\\n\\n Debbie had only recently moved here with her parents. She had no brothers or sisters. Her dad was a computer whiz who regularly flew around the world on business. They\u0027d moved five times since she was born.\\n\\n She was interested to learn that I was also used to moving around. I didn\u0027t tell her about the Cirque Du Freak, but said I was on the road a lot with my dad, who was a traveling salesman.\\n\\n Debbie wanted to know why she hadn\u0027t seen my father in the square. \"I\u0027ve seen you and your brother lots of times, but never your dad.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s an early riser,\" I lied. \"He gets up before dawn and doesn\u0027t come back until after dark most days.\"\\n\\n \"He leaves the two of you alone in the hotel?\" She pursed her lips as she thought about it. \"What about school?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"Are these like the gloves you want?\" I avoided the question, picking a pair of red gloves off a rack.\\n\\n \"Almost,\" she said, studying them. \"Mine were a shade darker.\"\\n\\n We went on to another store and looked at a bunch of CD players. I didn\u0027t have much money on me, so I didn\u0027t buy anything.\\n\\n \"Of course, after Christmas they\u0027ll be on sale,\" Debbie sighed, \"but what can you do? If you wait, you\u0027ll look mean.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not worried about the money,\" I said. I could always get some from Mr. Crepsley.\\n\\n After failing to find the right kind of gloves in another couple of stores, we walked around for a while, watching the lights come on above the streets and in the windows.\\n\\n \"I love this time of evening,\" Debbie said. \"It\u0027s like one city goes to sleep and a new one wakes up.\"\\n\\n \"A city of nightwalkers,\" I said, thinking of Mr. Crepsley.\\n\\n \"Hmmm,\" she said, looking at me suspiciously. \"Where are you from? I can\u0027t place your accent.\"\\n\\n \"Here and there,\" I answered vaguely. \"Around and about.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not going to tell me, are you?\" she asked directly.\\n\\n \"My dad doesn\u0027t like me telling people,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Why not?\" she challenged me.\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t tell you.\" I grinned weakly.\\n\\n \"Hmmm,\" she grunted, but let the matter drop. \"What\u0027s your hotel like?\" she asked. \"It looks kind of stuffy. Is it?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I said. \"It\u0027s better than most places I\u0027ve been. The staff don\u0027t hassle you if you play in the corridors. And some of the customers...\" I told her about the guy who walked around nude.\\n\\n \"No!\" she squealed. \"You\u0027re kidding!\"\\n\\n \"Honest,\" I swore.\\n\\n \"They don\u0027t kick him out?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s paying. As far as they\u0027re concerned, he has the right to walk around however he pleases.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll have to come over sometime.\" She grinned.\\n\\n \"Whenever you like,\" I said, smiling. \"Except during the day,\" I added quickly, remembering the slumbering Mr. Crepsley. The last thing I wanted was for Debbie to walk in on a vampire while he was sleeping.\\n\\n We headed back for the square, taking our time. I liked being with Debbie. I knew I shouldn\u0027t be making friends with humans - it was too dangerous - but it was hard to reject her. I hadn\u0027t been around anyone my own age, except Evra, since becoming a half-vampire.\\n\\n \"What will you tell your parents about the gloves?\" I asked as we stood on the front step of her house.\\n\\n She shrugged. \"The truth. I\u0027ll start coughing when I tell them. Hopefully they\u0027ll feel sorry for me and won\u0027t get too mad.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re bad.\" I laughed.\\n\\n \"With a name like Hemlock, are you surprised?\" She smiled, then asked, \"Do you want to come in for a while?\"\\n\\n I checked my watch. Mr. Crepsley would be up by now and had probably already left the hotel. I didn\u0027t like the idea of leaving Evra alone too long: he might get annoyed if he thought I was neglecting him and decide to return to the Cirque Du Freak. \"Better not,\" I said. \"It\u0027s late. I\u0027m expected back.\"\\n\\n \"Suit yourself,\" Debbie said. \"Feel free to come over tomorrow if you want. Anytime. I\u0027ll be in.\"\\n\\n \"Won\u0027t you be at school?\" I asked.\\n\\n She shook her head. \"With the holidays so close, Mom said I don\u0027t have to go back until the New Year.\"\\n\\n \"But she let you out to look for gloves?\"\\n\\n Debbie bit her lip with embarrassment. \"She doesn\u0027t know I\u0027ve been out walking,\" she admitted. \"I left in a taxi, telling her I was going to see a friend. I was supposed to come back in a taxi, too.\"\\n\\n \"Aha!\" I smiled. \"Now I can blackmail you.\"\\n\\n \"Just try it!\" She snorted. \"I\u0027ll cook up a witch\u0027s brew and turn you into a frog.\" She fished a key out of her purse and paused. \"You will come over, won\u0027t you? It gets pretty dull by myself. I haven\u0027t made many friends here yet.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t mind coming,\" I said, \"but how will you explain me to your mother? You can\u0027t exactly tell her we met in a taxi.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re right.\" Her eyes narrowed. \"I didn\u0027t think of that.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not just a pretty face,\" I said jokingly.\\n\\n \"Not even a pretty face!\" She laughed. \"How about I come over to the hotel?\" she suggested. \"We can go on to the movies from there, and I can tell Mom that\u0027s where we met.\"\\n\\n \"Okay,\" I said, and told her my room number. \"But not too early,\" I warned. \"Wait until five or six, when it\u0027s pretty dark.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\" She tapped her foot on the doorstep. \" Well?\" she said.\\n\\n \"Well what?\" I replied.\\n\\n \"Aren\u0027t you going to ask?\"\\n\\n \"Ask what?\"\\n\\n \"Ask me to go to a movie,\" she said.\\n\\n \"But you just -?\\n\\n \"Darren,\" she sighed. \"Girls never ask boys out.\"\\n\\n \"They don\u0027t?\" I was confused.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re clueless, aren\u0027t you?\" She chuckled. \"Just ask me if I want to go to the movies, okay?\"\\n\\n \"Okay,\" I groaned. \"Debbie - will you come to the movies with me?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll think about it,\" she said, then unlocked the door and disappeared inside.\\n\\n Girls!\\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tunnels-of-blood-the-saga-of-darren-shan-3/page-6.html","bookId":2439,"book":{"id":2439,"title":"Tunnels of Blood (The Saga of Darren Shan #3)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #3: Tunnels of Blood \\n This story introduces Gavner Purl, a full vampire, an old friend of Mr. Crepsley.
