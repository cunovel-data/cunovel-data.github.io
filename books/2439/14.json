{"id":79124,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"Before dusk descended the next night, Evra went around to the block of apartments to keep watch on the fat man. I stayed home, in order to follow Mr. Crepsley. If the vampire headed for the apartments, I\u0027d join Evra. If he went anywhere else, we\u0027d discuss the situation and decide whether Evra should desert his post or stay.\\n\\n The vampire rose promptly as the sun went down. He was looking more cheerful tonight, though he still wouldn\u0027t have appeared out of place in a funeral parlor.\\n\\n \"Where is Evra?\" he asked, diving into the meal I had prepared.\\n\\n \"Shopping,\" I said.\\n\\n \"By himself?\" Mr. Crepsley paused. For a moment\\n\\n I thought he was suspicious, but he was just looking for the salt.\\n\\n \"I think he\u0027s buying Christmas presents,\" I said.\\n\\n \"I thought Evra was above such absurdities. What is the date, anyway?\"\\n\\n \"The twentieth of December,\" I answered.\\n\\n \"And Christmas is the twenty-fifth?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said.\\n\\n Mr. Crepsley rubbed his scar thoughtfully. \"My business here may have come to an end by then,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Oh?\" I tried not to sound curious or excited.\\n\\n \"I had planned to move on as soon as possible, but if you wish to remain here for Christmas, we can. I understand the staff are hosting some kind of celebration?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said.\\n\\n \"You would like to attend?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" I forced a smile. \"Evra and me are buying presents for each other. We\u0027re going to eat dinner with the rest of the guests and eat cookies and stuff ourselves with turkey. You can come, too, if you want.\" I tried to make it sound like I wanted him there.\\n\\n He smiled and shook his head. \"Such follies do not appeal to me,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Suit yourself,\" I replied.\\n\\n As soon as he left, I started after him. He led me straight to the slaughterhouse, which surprised me. Maybe it wasn\u0027t the fat man he was interested in: perhaps there was something - or somebody - else there that he had his eye on.\\n\\n I discussed it with Evra over the phone.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s weird,\" he agreed. \"Maybe he wants to catch him when he\u0027s entering or leaving work.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe,\" I said uncertainly. Something seemed odd about it. The vampire wasn\u0027t behaving as I had expected him to.\\n\\n Evra stayed where he was, to follow the fat man. I chose a safe spot to hide, next to a warm pipe that kept some of the cold out. My view of the slaughterhouse wasn\u0027t as good as it had been last night, but I had a clear sight of Mr. Crepsley, which was what mattered.\\n\\n The fat man arrived at the scheduled time, Evra soon after him. I moved to the edge of the roof when I saw them, ready to leap down and intervene if Mr. Crepsley made his move. But the vampire remained stationary.\\n\\n And that was it for the night. Mr. Crepsley sat on his ledge; Evra and me crouched on ours; the workers kept the slaughterhouse up and running. At three in the morning, the fat man reappeared and went home.\\n\\n Once again Mr. Crepsley followed, and once again we followed Mr. Crepsley. This time the vampire didn\u0027t go up to the landing, but that was the only change in the routine.\\n\\n The next night, the exact same thing happened.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s he up to?\" Evra asked. The cold was getting to him and he was complaining about cramps in his legs. I had told him he could leave, but he was determined to stick it out.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"Maybe he\u0027s waiting for a special time to act. Maybe the moon has to be in a certain position or something.\"\\n\\n \"I thought werewolves were the only monsters affected by the moon,\" Evra said, half-jokingly.\\n\\n \"I thought so, too,\" I said. \"But I\u0027m not sure. There\u0027s so much Mr. Crepsley hasn\u0027t told me about being a full vampire. You could fill a book with all the stuff I know nothing about.\"\\n\\n \"What are we going to do if he attacks?\" Evra asked. \"Do you think we stand a chance against him in a fight?\"\\n\\n \"Not a fair fight,\" I said. \"But in a dirty one...\" I pulled out a long, rusty butcher\u0027s knife, let Evra\u0027s eyes focus on it, then slipped it back beneath my shirt.\\n\\n \"Where did you get that?\" Evra gasped.\\n\\n \"I came exploring around the slaughterhouse to-day, to familiarize myself with the layout, and found this knife lying in a bin out back. I guess it was too rusty to be of any use.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what you\u0027re going to use?\" Evra asked quietly.\\n\\n I nodded. \"I\u0027ll slit his throat,\" I whispered. \"I\u0027ll wait for him to make his move, then...\" I clenched my jaw shut.\\n\\n \"You think you can do it? He\u0027s really fast. If you miss your first chance, you probably won\u0027t get a second.\"\\n\\n \"He won\u0027t be expecting me,\" I said. \"I can do it.\" I faced Evra. \"I know we agreed to do this together, but I want to go after him by myself when the time comes.\"\\n\\n \"No way!\" Evra hissed.\\n\\n \"I have to,\" I said. \"You can\u0027t move as quietly or as quickly as me. If you come, you\u0027ll be in the way. Besides,\" I added, \"if things go badly and I fail, you\u0027ll still be around to take another shot at him. Wait for day and get him while he\u0027s sleeping.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe that\u0027s the best solution,\" Evra said. \"Maybe we should both wait. The main reason we\u0027re here is to confirm he\u0027s the killer. If he is, and we get proof, why don\u0027t we wait and -?\\n\\n \"No,\" I said softly. \"I won\u0027t let him murder that man.\"\\n\\n \"You know nothing about him,\" Evra said. \"Remember what I said: that the six dead people may have been killed because they were evil? Maybe this guy\u0027s rotten.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t care,\" I said stubbornly. \"I only agreed to go along with Mr. Crepsley because he convinced me he wasn\u0027t bad, that he didn\u0027t kill people. If he is a killer, I\u0027m guilty, too, for believing him and helping him all this time. I could do nothing to stop the first six murders - but if I can prevent number seven, I will.\"\\n\\n \"Okay,\" Evra sighed. \"Have it your own way.\"\\n\\n \"You won\u0027t interfere?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" he promised.\\n\\n \"Even if I run into trouble and look like I need help?\"\\n\\n He hesitated before nodding. \"All right. Not even then.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a good friend, Evra,\" I said, clasping his hands.\\n\\n \"Think so?\" He smiled bitterly. \"Wait until you mess up with Mr. Crepsley and end up trapped, screaming for help, only for me to ignore you. We\u0027ll see what kind of a friend you think I am then!\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tunnels-of-blood-the-saga-of-darren-shan-3/page-14.html","bookId":2439,"book":{"id":2439,"title":"Tunnels of Blood (The Saga of Darren Shan #3)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #3: Tunnels of Blood \\n This story introduces Gavner Purl, a full vampire, an old friend of Mr. Crepsley.
