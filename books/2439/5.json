{"id":79115,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"It felt strange being in a city. The noise and smell almost drove me crazy the first couple of days: with my heightened senses it was like being in the middle of a whirring blender. I lay in bed during the daytime, covering my head with the thickest pillow I could find. But by the end of the week I\u0027d grown used to the supersharp sounds and scents and learned to ignore them.\n We stayed at a hotel located in the corner of a quiet city square. In the evenings, when traffic was slow, neighborhood kids gathered outside for a game of soccer. I would have loved to join in but didn\u0027t dare - with my extra strength, I might accidentally end up breaking somebody\u0027s bones, or worse.\n By the start of our second week, we\u0027d fallen into a comfortable routine. Evra and me woke up every morning - Mr. Crepsley went off by himself at night without telling us where - and ate a big breakfast. After that we\u0027d head out and explore the city, which was big and old and full of interesting stuff. We\u0027d get back to the hotel at nightfall, in case Mr. Crepsley wanted us, then watch some TV or play computer games. We usually got to bed between eleven and twelve.\n After a year with the Cirque Du Freak, it was a thrill to live like a normal human again. I loved being able to sleep late in the morning, not having to worry about finding food for the Little People; it was great not to be rushing around, running errands for the performers; and sitting back at night, stuffing my face with candy and pickled onions and watching TV - that was the best!\n Evra was enjoying himself, too. He\u0027d never known a life like this. He\u0027d been part of the circus world for as long as he could remember, first with a nasty sideshow owner, then with Mr. Tall. He liked the Cirque - I did, too - and was looking forward to returning, but he had to admit it was nice to have a break.\n \"I never realized TV could be so addictive,\" he said one night, after we\u0027d watched five shows in a row.\n \"My mom and dad never let me watch too much,\" I told him, \"but I knew guys in school who watched five or six hours of it every night of the week!\"\n \"I wouldn\u0027t take it that far,\" Evra mused, \"but it\u0027s fun in small doses. Maybe I\u0027ll buy a portable TV when we get back to the Cirque Du Freak.\"\n \"I never thought of getting a TV since I joined,\" I said. \"So much else was going on, it was the last thing on my mind. But you\u0027re right - it would be nice to have a TV, even if we could only watch reruns of The Simpsons.\" That was our favorite show.\n I wondered sometimes what Mr. Crepsley was up to - he\u0027d always been mysterious, but never this secretive - but in truth I wasn\u0027t overly bothered: it was nice to have him out of my hair.\n Evra had to wrap up in layers of clothes whenever we went out. Not because of the cold - though it was chilly: the first snow had fallen a couple of days after our arrival - but because of how he looked. Although he didn\u0027t mind people staring at him - he was used to it - it was easier to get around if he was able to pass for a normal human. That way he didn\u0027t have to stop every five or ten minutes to explain to a curious stranger who and what he was.\n Covering his body, legs, and arms was easy - pants, a sweatshirt, and gloves - but his face was tricky: it wasn\u0027t as heavily scaled or colored as the rest of him, but it wasn\u0027t the face of an ordinary human. A big baseball hat took care of his long yellow-green hair, and dark glasses shaded a lot of the upper half of his face. But as for the lower half...\n We experimented with bandages and flesh-colored paints before hitting on the answer: a fake beard! We bought it in a joke shop, and although it looked silly - nobody would mistake it for a real one - it did the job.\n \"We must look like quite a pair,\" Evra said with a giggle one day as we strolled around a zoo. \"You in your pirate costume, me in this getup. People probably think we\u0027re a couple of escaped crazies.\"\n \"The people at the hotel definitely do.\" I giggled. \"I\u0027ve heard the bellboys and maids talking about us - they think Mr. Crepsley is a mad doctor and we\u0027re two of his patients.\"\n \"Yeah?\" Evra laughed. \"Imagine if they knew the truth - that you\u0027re a couple of vampires and I\u0027m a snake-boy!\"\n \"I don\u0027t think it would matter,\" I said. Mr. Crepsley tips well, and that\u0027s the important thing. \u0027Money buys privacy, as I heard one of the managers say when a maid was complaining about a guy who\u0027d been walking around naked in the corridors.\"\n \"I saw him!\" Evra exclaimed. \"I thought he locked himself out of his room.\"\n \"Nope,\" I smiled. \"Apparently he\u0027s been walking around like that for four or five days. According to the manager, he comes every year for a couple of weeks and spends the entire time roaming around naked as a baby.\"\n \"They let him?\" Evra asked in awe.\n \" \u0027Money buys privacy, \" I repeated.\n \"And I thought the Cirque Du Freak was a strange place to live,\" Evra muttered wryly. \"Humans are even weirder than us!\"\n As the days passed, the city became more and more Christmasy as people geared themselves up for the twenty-fifth of December. Christmas trees appeared; lights and decorations lit up the streets and windows each night; Father Christmas touched down and took orders; toys of every shape and size filled store shelves from floor to ceiling.\n I was looking forward to Christmas: last year\u0027s had passed unnoticed, since Christmas was something hardly anyone associated with the Cirque Du Freak bothered celebrating.\n Evra couldn\u0027t understand what the fuss was about.\n \"What\u0027s the point of it?\" he kept asking. \"People spend a bunch of money buying each other presents they don\u0027t really need; they drive themselves half-crazy getting a big dinner ready; trees and turkey are bred and slaughtered in huge numbers. It\u0027s ridiculous!\"\n I tried telling him that it was a day of peace and goodwill, when families come together and rejoice, but he wouldn\u0027t listen. As far as he was concerned, it was a crazy money-making racket.\n Mr. Crepsley, of course, only snorted whenever the subject was brought up. \"A silly human custom,\" was how he put it. He didn\u0027t want anything to do with the festival.\n It would be a lonely Christmas without my family - I missed them more at this time of the year than ever, especially Annie - but at the same time, I was looking forward to it. The hotel staff were throwing a big party for the guests. There\u0027d be turkey and ham and Christmas cake and cookies. I was determined to make Evra get some Christmas spirit: I was sure he\u0027d change his opinion when he experienced Christmas firsthand.\n \"Want to come shopping?\" I asked one frosty afternoon, wrapping a scarf around my neck (I didn\u0027t need it - my vampire blood kept me warm - or the thick coat or heavy sweatshirt, but I\u0027d draw attention if I went out without them).\n Evra glanced out the window. It had been snowing earlier and the world outside was frosty-white.\n \"Nah,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t feel like getting into heavy clothes again.\" We\u0027d been out that morning, throwing snowballs at each other.\n \"Okay,\" I said, glad he wasn\u0027t coming: I wanted to look over a few presents for him. \"I won\u0027t be more than an hour or two.\"\n \"Will you be back before dark?\" Evra asked.\n \"Maybe,\" I said.\n \"You\u0027d better be.\" He nodded toward the room where Mr. Crepsley lay sleeping. \"You know how it goes: the one night you aren\u0027t here when he wakes will be the one night he wants you.\"\n I laughed. \"I\u0027ll risk it. Want me to bring you back anything?\" Evra shook his head. \"Okay. See you soon.\"\n I walked through the snow, whistling to myself. I liked snow: it covered up most of the smells and muffled a lot of the noise. Some of the kids who lived in the square were out building a snowman. I stopped to watch them but moved on before they could ask me to join in: it was easier not to get involved with humans.\n As I stood outside a large department store, studying the window display, wondering what to buy Evra, a girl walked over and stood beside me. She was dark-skinned, with long black hair. She looked about my age and was a little shorter than me.\n \"Ahoy, cap\u0027n,\" she said, saluting.\n \"Excuse me?\" I replied, startled.\n \"The costume,\" she grinned, tugging my coat open. \"I think it\u0027s cool, you look like a pirate. You going in or just looking?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"I\u0027m looking for a present for my brother, but I\u0027m not sure what to get him.\" That was our story - that Evra and me were brothers, and Mr. Crepsley was our father.\n \"Oh.\" She nodded. \"How old is he?\"\n \"A year older than me,\" I said.\n \"Aftershave,\" she said firmly.\n I shook my head. \"He hasn\u0027t started shaving yet.\" And never would: hairs wouldn\u0027t grow on Evra\u0027s scales.\n \"Okay,\" she said. \"How about a CD?\"\n \"He doesn\u0027t listen to much music,\" I said. \"Although if I got him a CD player, he might start.\"\n \"Those are expensive,\" the girl said.\n \"He\u0027s my only brother,\" I said. \"He\u0027s worth it.\"\n \"Then go for it.\" She held out a hand. She wasn\u0027t wearing gloves, despite the cold. \"My name\u0027s Debbie.\"\n I shook her hand - mine looked very white compared with her dark skin - and told her my name.\n \"Darren and Debbie.\" She smiled. \"That sounds good, like Bonnie and Clyde.\"\n \"Do you always talk to strangers like this?\" I asked.\n \"No,\" she said. \"But we\u0027re not strangers.\"\n \"We\u0027re not?\" I frowned.\n \"I\u0027ve seen you around,\" she said. \"I live in the square, a few doors up from the hotel. That\u0027s how I knew about the pirate costume. You hang out with that funny guy in glasses and a fake beard.\"\n \"Evra. He\u0027s the one I\u0027m buying the present for.\" I tried placing her face but couldn\u0027t remember seeing her with the other kids. \"I haven\u0027t noticed you around,\" I said.\n \"I haven\u0027t been out much,\" she replied. \"I\u0027ve been in bed with a cold. That\u0027s why I spotted you - I\u0027ve been spending my days staring out the window, studying the square. Life gets really boring when you\u0027re stuck in bed.\"\n Debbie blew into her hands and rubbed them together.\n \"You should be wearing gloves,\" I told her.\n \"Look who\u0027s talking.\" She sniffed. I\u0027d forgotten to put on a pair before leaving. \"Anyway, that\u0027s what I\u0027m here for - I lost my gloves earlier and I\u0027ve been roaming around from store to store trying to find an identical pair. I don\u0027t want my parents to find out I lost them on only my second day out of bed.\"\n \"What were they like?\" I asked.\n \"Red, with fake fur around the wrists,\" she said. \"My uncle gave them to me a few months ago but didn\u0027t say where he got them.\"\n \"Have you tried this place yet?\" I asked.\n \"Uh-uh,\" she said. \"I was on my way in when I spotted you.\"\n \"Want to come in with me?\" I asked.\n \"Sure,\" she said. \"I hate shopping by myself. I\u0027ll help you choose a CD player if you want. I know a lot about them.\"\n \"Okay,\" I said, then pushed the door open and held it for her.\n \"Why, Darren,\" she said with a laugh, \"people will think you have a crush on me.\"\n I felt myself blushing and tried to think of an okay response - but couldn\u0027t. Debbie giggled, walked in, and left me to trail along behind her. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tunnels-of-blood-the-saga-of-darren-shan-3/page-5.html","bookId":2439,"book":{"id":2439,"title":"Tunnels of Blood (The Saga of Darren Shan #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The Saga of Darren Shan #3: Tunnels of Blood \n This story introduces Gavner Purl, a full vampire, an old friend of Mr. Crepsley.
