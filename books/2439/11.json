Evra hesitated. \"It might not have been him.\" \"Come off it!\" I barked. \"Who else could it have been?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"The blood was sucked out of them!\" I shouted. \"That\u0027s what the reporters think,\" Evra said. \"They weren\u0027t certain.\" \"Maybe we should wait,\" I huffed. \"Wait for him to kill another five or six, huh?\" Evra sighed. \"I don\u0027t know what we should do,\" he said. \"But I think we should have proof before we go after him. Chopping a person\u0027s head off is kind of final. If we find out later we were mistaken, there\u0027s no going back. We can\u0027t glue his head back on and say, \u0027Sorry, all a big mistake, no hard feelings.? He was right. Killing Mr. Crepsley without proof would be wrong. But it had to be him! Those nights out, acting so strangely, not telling us what he was doing - it all added up. \"There\u0027s something else,\" Evra said. I glanced down at him. \"Let\u0027s say Mr. Crepsley is the killer.\" \"I have no problem accepting that.\" I grunted. \"Why would he do it?\" Evra asked. \"It\u0027s not his style. I\u0027ve known him longer than you have, and I\u0027ve never seen or heard of him doing anything like this. He\u0027s not a killer.\" \"He probably killed when he was a Vampire General,\" I said. I had told Evra about my conversation with Gavner Purl. \"Yes,\" Evra agreed. \"He killed evil vampires, who deserved to be killed. What I\u0027m saying is, if he did kill these six people, maybe they had to be killed, too. Maybe they were vampires.\" I shook my head. \"He gave up being a Vampire General years ago.\" \"Gavner Purl could have persuaded him to join again,\" Evra said. \"We don\u0027t know anything about the Vampire Generals or how they work. Maybe that\u0027s why Mr. Crepsley came here.\" It sounded halfway reasonable, but I didn\u0027t believe it. \"Six evil vampires on the loose in one city?\" I asked. \"What are the odds against that?\" \"Who knows?\" Evra said. \"Do you know how an evil vampire behaves? I don\u0027t, maybe they form gangs.\" \"And Mr. Crepsley wiped them out by himself?\" I said. \"Vampires are tough to kill. He\u0027d have no problem killing six humans, but six vampires? No way.\" \"Who says he was alone?\" Evra asked. \"Maybe Gavner Purl was with him. Maybe there\u0027s a bunch of Vampire Generals in town.\" \"Your argument\u0027s getting weaker by the second,\" I commented. \"Possibly,\" Evra said, \"but that doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027m wrong. We don\u0027t know, Darren. You can\u0027t kill Mr. Crepsley on a hunch. We have to wait. Think about it and you\u0027ll see I\u0027m right.\" I calmed down and thought it over. \"Okay,\" I sighed. \"He\u0027s innocent until proven guilty. But what should we do? Sit back and pretend nothing\u0027s happened? Report him to the police? Ask him straight to his face?\" \"If we were at the Cirque Du Freak,\" Evra mused, \"we could tell Mr. Tall and leave it in his hands.\" \"But we\u0027re not at the Cirque,\" I reminded him. \"No,\" he said. \"We\u0027re on our own.\" His narrow eyes narrowed even further as he mulled it over. \"How about this? We track him every night when he leaves, see where he goes and what he gets up to. If we find out he\u0027s the killer, and that these are ordinary humans, then we kill him.\" \"You\u0027d do that?\" I asked. Evra nodded. \"I\u0027ve never killed before,\" he said quietly, \"and I hate the thought of it. But if Mr. Crepsley is murdering without good cause, I\u0027ll help you kill him. I\u0027d rather leave it to someone else, but since there isn\u0027t anybody...\" His face was serious, and I knew I could rely on him. \"But we have to be sure,\" Evra warned me. \"If there\u0027s even a glimmer of doubt, we can\u0027t do it.\" \"Agreed,\" I said. \"And it has to be a joint decision,\" Evra added. \"You have to promise you won\u0027t kill him without my approval.\" \"Okay.\" \"I\u0027m serious,\" he told me. \"If I think Mr. Crepsley is innocent, and you go after him, I\u0027ll do everything I can to stop you. Even if it means...\" He left the threat unfinished. \"Don\u0027t worry,\" I said. \"This isn\u0027t something I\u0027m looking forward to. I\u0027ve grown used to Mr. Crepsley. The last thing I want to do is kill him.\" I was telling the truth. I\u0027d love it if my suspicions turned out to be wrong. But I had an awful feeling they wouldn\u0027t. \"I hope we\u0027re mistaken about this,\" Evra said. \"Saying we\u0027ll kill him is easy, but doing it would be a lot harder. He\u0027s not the kind to just lie there and do nothing while being attacked.\" \"We\u0027ll worry about that later,\" I said. \"For the moment, let\u0027s turn the sound back up. If we\u0027re lucky, the police will solve the case and it\u0027ll be nothing more than a crazy human who\u0027s seen one too many Dracula movies.\" I sat down beside Evra, and we spent the rest of night watching the news, rarely speaking, waiting for the vampire - the killer? - to return.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tunnels-of-blood-the-saga-of-darren-shan-3/page-11.html","bookId":2439,"book":{"id":2439,"title":"Tunnels of Blood (The Saga of Darren Shan #3)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #3: Tunnels of Blood This story introduces Gavner Purl, a full vampire, an old friend of Mr. Crepsley.
