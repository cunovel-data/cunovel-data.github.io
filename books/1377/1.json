{"id":11406,"no":1,"title":"CHAPTER I. MR. JONES OF CASTLE MORONY.","content":"In the year 1850 the two estates of Ballintubber and Morony were sold to Mr. Philip Jones, under the Estates Court, which had then been established. They had been the property of two different owners, but lay conveniently so as to make one possession for one proprietor. They were in the County Galway, and lay to the right and left of the road which runs down from the little town of Headford to Lough Corrib. At the time when the purchase was made there was no quieter spot in all Ireland, or one in which the lawful requirements of a landlord were more readily performed by a poor and obedient tenantry. The people were all Roman Catholics, were for the most part uneducated, and it may be said of them that not only were their souls not their own, but that they were not ambitious even of possessing their own bodies. Circumstances have changed much with them since that date. Not only have they in part repudiated the power of the priest as to their souls, but, in compliance with teaching which has come to them from America, they claim to be masters also of their bodies. Never were a people less fitted to exercise such dominion without control. Generous, kindly, impulsive, and docile, they have been willing to follow any recognised leader. When Philip Jones bought the property that had belonged to the widow O\u0027Dwyer—for Ballintubber had for the last hundred years been the property of the O\u0027Dwyers—and Morony, which, had been an outlying town-land belonging to the Hacketts for the last two centuries, he had at first been looked down upon as a new comer. But all that had passed by, and Mr. Jones was as much respected as though he had been an O\u0027Jones from the time of Queen Elizabeth. But now the American teaching had come up, and things were different. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Jones had expended over ￡30,000 in purchasing the property, and was congratulated by all men on having done well with his money. There were some among his friends in England—and his friends were all English—who had told him that he was incurring a great risk in going into so distant and wild a country. But it was acknowledged that he could not in England have obtained so good a return in the way of rent. And it was soon found that the opportunities for improving the property were many and close at hand. At the end of ten years all men who knew Mr. Jones personally, or had seen the increasing comforts of Morony Castle, declared that, as he liked the kind of life, he had done uncommonly well for himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n Nor had he done badly for his three married sisters, each of whom had left ￡4,000 in his hands. All the circumstances of the Miss Jones\u0027s as they had been, it will be here unnecessary to explain. Since Philip had become owner of Morony Castle, each of them had married, and the three brothers-in-law were equally well satisfied with the investment of their money. It will, however, thus be understood that the property did not belong entirely to Mr. Jones, and that the brothers-in-law and their wives were part owners. Mr. Jones, however, had been in possession of some other means, and had been able to use capital in improving the estate. But he was an aspiring man, and in addition to his money had borrowed something beyond. The sum borrowed, however, had been so small and so well expended, as to have created no sense of embarrassment in his mind. \\n\\n \\n\\n When our story commences he was the father of four children. The elder and the younger were boys, and two girls came between them. In 1880, Frank, the elder, was two-and-twenty. The two girls who followed close after were twenty and nineteen, and the youngest boy, who was born after an interval of nearly ten years, was but ten years old. Some years after the mother had died, and Mr. Jones had since lived as a widower. It may be as well to state here that in 1880 he was fifty-five years old. \\n\\n \\n\\n When his wife had died, the nature of the man had apparently been changed. Of all men he had been the most cheerful, the most eager, and the most easily pleased. He had worked hard at his property, and had loved his work. He knew every man and woman about the place, and always had a word to say to them. He had had a sailing boat on the lake, in which he had spent much of his time, but his wife had always been with him. Since her death he had hardly put his foot within the boat. He had lately become quick and short-tempered, but always with a visible attempt to be kind to those around him. But people said of him that since his wife had died he had shown an indifference to the affairs of the world. He was anxious—so it was said—to leave matters as much as possible to his son; but, as has been already stated, his son was only twenty-two. He had formerly taken a great pleasure in attending the assizes at Galway. He had been named as a grand juror for the county, which he had indeed regarded as a great compliment; but since his wife\u0027s death he had not once attended. \\n\\n \\n\\n People said of him that he had become indifferent to the work of his life, but in this they hardly spoke the truth. He had become indifferent rather to what had been its pleasures. To that which his conscience told him was its work, he applied himself with assiduity enough. There were two cares which sat near his heart: first, that no one should rob him; and secondly, that he should rob no one. It will often be the case that the first will look after itself, whereas the second will require careful watching. It was certainly the case with Philip Jones that he was most anxious to rob no one. He was, perhaps, a little too anxious that no one should rob him. \\n\\n \\n\\n A few words must be said of his children. Frank, the eldest, was a good-looking, clever boy, who had been educated at the Queen\u0027s College, at Galway, and would have been better trained to meet the world had circumstances enabled him to be sent to a public school in England. As it was he thought himself, as heir to Morony Castle, to be a little god upon earth; and he thought also that it behoved his sisters and his brother, and the various dependents about the place, to treat him as though he were a god. To his father he was respectful, and fairly obedient in all matters, save one. As to that one matter, from which arose some trouble, much will have to be said as the story goes on. \\n\\n \\n\\n The two girls were named Ada and Edith, and were, in form and figure, very unlike each other. Ada, the eldest, was tall, fair-haired, and very lovely. It was admitted in County Galway that among the Galway lasses no girl exceeded Ada Jones in brightness of beauty. She was sweet-tempered also, and gracious as she was lovely. But Edith did not share the gifts, which the fairy had bestowed upon her sister, in equal parts. She was, however, clever, and kind, and affectionate. In all matters, within the house, she was ready to accept a situation below her sister\u0027s; but this was not by her sister\u0027s doing. The demigod of the family seemed to assume this position, but on Ada\u0027s part there was no assumption. Edith, however, felt her infirmity. Among girls this is made to depend more on physical beauty than on other gifts, and there was no doubt that in this respect Edith was the inferior. She was dark, and small of stature, not ungraceful in her movements, or awkward in her person. She was black-haired, as had been her mother\u0027s, and almost swarthy in her complexion, and there was a squareness about her chin which robbed her face of much of its feminine softness. But her eyes were very bright, and when she would laugh, or say something intended to make another laugh, her face would be brightened up with fun, good-humour, or wit, in a manner which enabled no one to call her plain. \\n\\n \\n\\n Of the younger boy, Florian, much will be said as the story goes on; but what can be said of a boy who is only ten which shall be descriptive and also interesting? He was small of his age, but clever and sharp, and, since his mother\u0027s death, had been his father\u0027s darling. He was beautiful to look at, as were all the children, except poor Edith, but the neighbours declared that his education had been much neglected. His father intended to send him to college at Galway. A bright vision had for a short time flitted before the father\u0027s eyes, and he had thought that he would have the boy prepared for Winchester; but lately things had not gone quite so well at Morony Castle, and that idea had passed by. So that it was now understood that Florian Jones would follow his brother to Galway College. Those who used to watch his ways would declare that the professors of Galway College would have some trouble with him. \\n\\n \\n\\n While the mother had lived no family had been more easily ruled than that of the Jones\u0027s, but since her death some irregularities had gone on. The father had made a favourite of the younger boy, and thereby had done mischief. The eldest son, too, had become proud of his position, and an attempt had been made to check him with a hard hand; and yet much in the absolute working of the farm had been left to him. Then troubles had come, in which Mr. Jones would be sometimes too severe, and sometimes too lenient. Of the girls it must be acknowledged that they were to be blamed for no fault after the first blow had come. Everyone at Morony had felt that the great blow had been the death of the mistress. But it must be confessed that other things had happened shortly afterwards which had tended to create disturbance. One of the family had declared that he intended to become a Roman Catholic. The Jones\u0027s had been Protestants, the father and mother having both come from England as Protestants. They were not, therefore, Ultra-Protestants, as those will know who best know Ireland. There had been no horror of a Catholic. According to Mrs. Jones the way to heaven had been open to both Catholic and Protestant, only it had suited her to say her prayers after the Protestant fashion. The girls had been filled with no pious fury; and as to Mr. Jones himself, some of the Protestant devotees in the neighbourhood of Tuam had declared that he was only half-hearted in the matter. An old clergyman, attached to the cathedral, and who had been chaplain to Bishop Plunket, had been heard to declare that he would rather have to deal with an avowed Papist. \\n\\n \\n\\n But the one who had now declared himself as a convert,—I will say pervert if my readers wish it,—was no other than our young friend Florian. He came in one day and assured his sisters that he meant to be a Roman Catholic. They only laughed at him, and told him that he did not know what he was talking about. \"Don\u0027t I though?\" said Florian. \"I\u0027ve had no end of an argument with Father Malachi, and he\u0027s got the best o\u0027 me. I\u0027m not going to church any more.\" When his brother Frank was told, he threatened to \"lick the young sinner.\" \"That\u0027s about the best can be said for you Protestants,\" said the young imp. \"You lick us when you\u0027re strong enough.\" But the father, when he heard the tidings, declared that he would not have his son molested. No doubt he would live to see his mistake. It was to be hoped that he would do so. But there should be no compulsion. So Master Florian remained for the present attached to his Catholic propensities, and duly went to mass at Ballintubber. This had taken place in the autumn of the year. \\n\\n \\n\\n There had occurred a circumstance which may be called the beginning of our story. It must first be told that Mr. Jones kept about four hundred acres of the estate in his own hands, and had been held to have done very well with it. A tract of this land lay down on Lough Corrib, and had in former days produced almost nothing but rushes. By means of drains and sluices, which had not been brought into use without the expenditure of much capital, he had thoroughly fertilised some eighty acres, where he grew large crops of hay, which he sent across the lake to Galway, and fed his sheep on the after-grass with great profit. But the care of the sluices had been a great labour, and, latterly, a great trouble to Mr. Jones. He had looked for no evil at the hands of his workmen, or tenants, or neighbours. But he had been taught by experience to expect great carelessness. It was when the rain had fallen in heavy quantities, and when the Lough was full that the evil was chiefly expected. Late in the autumn there came news up to the Castle, that the flood gates on the Ballintubber marshes had now been opened, and that the entire eighty acres were under water. Mr. Jones and his eldest son rushed down, and found that it was impossible to do anything. They could only wait till the waters had retreated, which would not take place for six months. The entire crop for the next year had been destroyed. Then Mr. Jones returned to the Castle stricken by a great blow, and was speechless for the rest of the day. \\n\\n \\n\\n When the news had been brought, the family had been together at the breakfast table. The father and son had gone out together with the teller of the story. But Ada and Edith and Florian were left at the table. They all sat looking at each other till Edith was the first to speak. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Flory, what do you know of all this?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What should I know?\" said Flory. The two sisters looked at him, and each was aware that he did know something. Ada was not so quick as Edith, but even she was aroused. And from this moment Edith began to take the lead in managing her brother. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You do,\" said Ada. \"How was it done? Who did it—and why?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sorrow a know, I know,\" said the boy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Flory, that is a lie,\" said Edith very solemnly, looking at him with all her eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ve no right to say that,\" said Florian. \"It\u0027s just because I\u0027ve turned Catholic, and it\u0027s all your spite.\" But the boy blushed ruby red, and the colour told its own story. \\n\\n \\n\\n As soon as the news had been announced, Edith had seen the boy\u0027s countenance and had instantly watched him. His colour had not risen at once; but his lower jaw had fallen, and his eyes had glanced furtively round, and his whole frame had quivered. Then the rush of blood had flown to his face, and the story had been told so that Edith could read it. His first emotion had made it plain even to Ada. \"Flory, you know all about it,\" said Ada. \\n\\n \\n\\n Edith got up and went across the room and knelt down at the boy\u0027s side, leaning against his chair and looking up into his face. \"Flory, you may lie with your voice, but you cannot stifle your heart within you. You have confessed the truth.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have not,\" said Flory; \"I wasn\u0027t in it at all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who says that you were in it? But you know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Deed and I know nothin\u0027.\" Now the boy began to cry. \"You have no right to say I did it. Why should I do the likes of that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where were you at four o\u0027clock yesterday afternoon?\" asked Edith. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was just out, up at the lodge yonder.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Flory, I know that you have seen this thing done. I am as certain of it as though I had been there myself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t seen anything done—and I won\u0027t stay here to be questioned this way,\" said the boy, feeling that his blushes would betray him, and his incapacity to \"lie square,\" as the Americans say. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then the two sisters were left to talk over the matter together. \"Did you not see it in his face?\" said Edith. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, I saw something. But you don\u0027t mean to say that he knew it was to be done? That would make him a fiend.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No; I don\u0027t think he knew it was to be done. But when Frank was teasing him the other day about his Catholic nonsense, and saying that he would not trust a Papist, Florian took the part of Pat Carroll. If there be a man about the place who would do a base turn to father, it\u0027s Pat Carroll. Now I know that Flory was down near the lough yesterday afternoon. Biddy Ryan saw him. If he went on he must have seen the water coming in.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What shall we do?\" asked Ada. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah!—that\u0027s just it. What shall we do? If he could be made to tell the truth, that would be best. But as he denies it, father will believe him. Florian will say that we are spiting him because of his religion.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But, Edith, we must tell father.\" At last it was decided that Edith should take the boy and talk to him. He was more prone to listen to Edith than to Ada. Edith did find her brother, and talked to him for an hour,—but in vain. He had managed to collect himself after his past breakdown, and was better able to bear the examination to which his sister put him, than at the first moment. He still blushed when he was questioned; till he became dogged and surly. The interview ended with repeated asseverations on Flory\u0027s part, that he knew nothing of the meadows. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Jones and his eldest son returned to the house, having been absent the entire day. \"As sure as I am a living man, Pat Carroll has been at the doing of it,\" said Frank. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He cannot have done it alone,\" said Ada. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There have been others in it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That has been the worst of it,\" said the father. \"Of course I have known since the beginning of the year, that that man would do any devil\u0027s turn of work against me. But one man cannot do much.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Too much! too much!\" said Edith. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"One man can murder me, of course. But we haven\u0027t yet come to such a state of things as that. Twelve months ago I thought there was not a man about the place who would raise his hand to do me an ill turn. I have done them many good turns in my time.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You have, father,\" said Ada. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then this man came to me and said that because the tenants away in County Mayo were not paying their rents, he could not pay his. And he can sell his interest on his holding now for ￡150. When I endeavoured to explain this to him, and that it was at my cost his interest in the farm has been created, he became my enemy. I don\u0027t mind that; one has to look for that. But that others should be joined in it, and that there should be no one to say that they had seen it! There must have been five pairs of hands at work, and twenty pairs of eyes must have seen what the others were doing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The two sisters looked at each other, but they said nothing. \"I suppose we shall work it out of them some day,\" said Frank. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose nothing of the kind,\" said the father. \"There are eighty acres of meadow lying under Lough Corrib this moment which will not give a ton of hay next summer, or food for a sheep next autumn. The pastures will be saturated, and sheep would perish with foot-rot and fluke. Then money must be laid out again upon it, just that Mr. Carroll may again wreak his vengeance.\" After that there was silence, for the children felt that not a word could be spoken which would comfort their father. \\n\\n \\n\\n When they sat down to dinner, Mr. Jones asked after Florian. \"He\u0027s not well,\" said Edith. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Florian not well! So there\u0027s another misfortune.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"His ill-health is rather ill-humour. Biddy will take care of him, father.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do not choose that he should be looked after by Biddy in solitude. I suppose that somebody has been teasing him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, father,\" said Edith, positively. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Has anyone been speaking to him about his religion?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not a word,\" said Edith. Then she told herself that to hold her tongue at the present moment would be cowardly. \"Florian, father, has misbehaved himself, and has gone away cross. I would leave him, if I were you, till to-morrow.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know there is ill-will against him,\" said the father. All this was ill-judged on behalf of Mr. Jones. Peter, the old butler, who had lived in the family, was in the room. Peter, of course, was a Roman Catholic, and, though he was as true as steel, it could not but be felt that in this absurd contest he was on the side of the \"young masther.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Down in the kitchen the conversion of the \"young masther\" to the true religion was a great affair, and Mr. Frank and the young ladies were looked upon as hard-hearted and cruel, because they stood in the way of this act of grace. Nothing more was said about Florian that night. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2744/75539.html","bookId":1377,"book":{"id":1377,"title":"The Landleaguers","description":"简介： In the year 1850 the two estates of Ballintubber and Morony were sold to Mr. Philip Jones, under the Estates Court, which had then been established.
