{"id":11445,"no":40,"title":"CHAPTER XL. YORKE CLAYTON AGAIN MAKES LOVE.","content":"\"I am not quite sure about Peter yet,\" said Clayton to Mr. Jones. \"But if we could look into his very soul I am afraid he could not do much for us.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I never believed in Peter as a witness,\" replied Mr. Jones. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I should like to know exactly what he did see;—whether it was a limb or a bit of his coat. But I think that young lady crept out and saw him cleaning his pistol. And I think that the old lady had a glimpse of the mask. I think that they can be made to say so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I saw the mask myself, and the muzzle of the rifle;—and I saw the man running as plainly as I see you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That will all be wanted, Mr. Jones. But I trust that we may have to summon you to Dublin. As things are at present, if Lax had been seen in broad daylight firing at the poor boy by a dozen farmers it would do no good in County Galway. There is Miss Edith out there. She is awfully anxious about this wretch who destroyed her brother. I will go and tell her.\" So Captain Clayton rushed out, anxious for another cause for triumph. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Jones had heard of his suit, and had heard also that the suit was made to Edith and not to Ada. \"There is not one in a dozen who would have taken Edith,\" said he to himself,—\"unless it be one who saw her with my eyes.\" But yet he did not approve of the marriage. \"They were poverty stricken,\" he said, and Clayton went about from day to day with his life in his hand. \"A brave man,\" he said to himself; \"but singularly foolhardy,—unless it be that he wants to die.\" He had not been called upon for his consent, for Edith had never yielded. She, too, had said that it was impossible. \"If Ada would have suited, it might have been possible, but not between Yorke and me.\" They had both come now to call him by his Christian name; and they to him were Ada and Edith; but with their father he had never quite reached the familiarity of a Christian name. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Jones had, in truth, been so saddened by the circumstances of the last two years that he could not endure the idea of marriages in his family. \"Of course, if you choose, my dear, you can do as you like,\" he used to say to Edith. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I don\u0027t choose.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What there are left of us should, I think, remain together. I suppose they cannot turn me out of this house. The Prime Minister will hardly bring in a Bill that the estates bought this last hundred years shall belong to the owners of the next century. He can do so, of course, as things go now. There are no longer any lords to stop him, and the House of Commons, who want their seats, will do anything he bids them. It\u0027s the First Lieutenant who looks after Ireland, who has ideas of justice with which the angels of light have certainly not filled his mind. That we should get nothing from our purchased property this century, and give it up in the course of the next, is in strict accordance with his thinking. We can depend upon nothing. My brother-in-law can, of course, sell me out any day, and would not stop for a moment. Everybody has to get his own, except an Irish landlord. But I think we should fare ill all together. Your brother is behaving nobly, and I don\u0027t think we ought to desert him. Of course you can do as you please.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Then the squire pottered on, wretched in heart; or, rather, down in the mouth, as we say, and gave his advice to his younger daughter, not, in truth, knowing how her heart stood. But a man, when he undertakes to advise another, should not be down in the mouth himself. Equam memento rebus in arduis servare mentem, non secus ac bonis. If not, your thoughts will be too strongly coloured by your own misfortunes to allow of your advising others. \\n\\n \\n\\n All this Edith knew,—except the Latin. The meaning of it had been brought home to her by her own light. \"Poor papa is so hipped,\" she said to herself, \"that he thinks that nobody will ever be happy again.\" But still she resolved that she would not marry Yorke Clayton. There had been a mistake, and she had made it,—a miserable blunder for which she was responsible. She did not quite analyse the matter in her own mind, or look into the thoughts of Ada, or of Yorke himself,—the hero of her pillow; but she continued to tell herself that the proper order of things would not admit it. Ada, she knew, wished it. Yorke longed for her, more strongly even than for Lax, the murderer. For herself, when she would allow her thoughts to stray for a moment in that direction, all the bright azure tints of heaven were open to her. But she had made a mistake, and she did not deserve it. She had been a blind fool, and blind fools deserved no azure tints of heaven. \\n\\n \\n\\n If she could have had her own way she would still have married Ada to Yorke Clayton. When Ada told her that she had got over her foolish love, it was the mere babble of unselfishness. Feel a passion for such a man as Yorke Clayton, look into the depth of his blue eyes, and fancy for herself a partnership with the spirit hidden away within, and then get over it! Edith was guilty here of the folly of judging of her sister as herself. And as for Yorke himself;—a man, she said, always satisfies himself with that which is lovely and beautiful. And with Ada he would have such other gifts as so strong a man as Yorke always desires in his wife. In temper she was perfect; in unselfishness she was excellent. In all those ways of giving aid, which some women possess and some not at all,—but which, when possessed, go so far to make the comfort of a house,—she was supreme. If a bedroom were untidy, her eye saw it at once. If a thing had to be done at the stroke of noon, she would remember that other things could not be done at the same time. If a man liked his egg half-boiled, she would bear it in her mind for ever. She would know the proper day for making this marmalade and that preserve; and she would never lose her good looks for a moment when she was doing these things. With her little dusting-brush at her girdle, no eyes that knew anything would ever take her for aught but a lady. She was just the wife for Yorke Clayton. \\n\\n \\n\\n So Edith argued it in her own bosom, adding other wondrous mistakes to that first mistake she had made. In thinking of it all she counted herself for nothing, and made believe that she was ugly in all eyes. She would not allow the man to see as his fancy led him; and could not bring herself to think that if now the man should change his mind and offer his hand to Ada, it would be impossible that Ada should accept it. Nor did she perceive that Ada had not suffered as she had suffered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wanted to catch you just for one moment,\" said Yorke Clayton, running out so as to catch his prey. She had half wished to fly from him, and had half told herself that any such flight was foolish. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What is it, Yorke?\" she said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think,—I do think that I have at last got Lax upon the hip.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are so bloody-minded about Lax.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What! Are you going to turn round and be merciful?\" He was her hero, and she certainly felt no mercy towards the murderer of her brother; no mercy towards him who she now thought had planned all the injury done to her father; no mercy towards him who had thrice fired at her beloved. This wretched man had struggled to get the blood of him who was all the world to her; and had been urged on to his black deeds by no thought, by no feeling, that was not in itself as vile as hell! Lax was to her a viper so noxious as to be beyond the pale of all mercy. To crush him beneath the heel of her boot, so as to make an end of him, as of any other poisonous animal, was the best mercy to all other human beings. But she had said the word at the spur of the moment, because she had been instigated by her feelings to gainsay her hero, and to contradict him, so that he might think that he was no hero of hers. She looked at him for the moment, and said nothing, though he held her by the arm. \"If you say I am to spare him, I will spare him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" she answered, \"because of your duty.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Have I followed this man simply as a duty? Have I lain awake thinking of it till I have given to the pursuit such an amount of energy as no duty can require? Thrice he has endeavoured to kill me, firing at me in the dark, getting at me from behind hedges, as no one who has anything of the spirit of man in his bosom will do when he strives to destroy his enemy. All that has been nothing. I am a policeman in search of him, and am the natural enemy of a murderer. Of course in the ordinary way I would not have spared him; but the ordinary way would have sufficed. Had he escaped me I could have laughed at all that. But he took that poor lad\u0027s life!\" Here he looked sadly into her face, and she could see that there was a tear within his eye. \"That was much, but that was not all. That lad was your brother, him whom you so dearly loved. He shot down the poor child before his father\u0027s face, simply because he had said that he would tell the truth. When you wept, when you tore your hair, when you flung yourself in sorrow upon the body, I told myself that either he or I must die. And now you bid me be merciful.\" Then the big tears dropped down his cheeks, and he began to wail himself,—hardly like a man. \\n\\n \\n\\n And what did Edith do? She stood and looked at him for a few moments; then extricated herself from the hold he still had of her, and flung herself into his arms. He put down his face and kissed her forehead and her cheeks; but she put up her mouth and kissed his lips. Not once or twice was that kiss given; but there they stood closely pressed to each other in a long embrace. \"My hero,\" she said; \"my hero.\" It had all come at last,—the double triumph; and there was, he felt, no happier man in all Ireland than he. He thought, at least, that the double battle had been now won. But even yet it was not so. \"Captain Clayton,\" she began. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why Captain? Why Clayton?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My brother Yorke,\" and she pressed both his hands in hers. \"You can understand that I have been carried away by my feelings, to thank you as a sister may thank a brother.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I will not have it,\" he exclaimed fiercely. \"You are no sister, nor can I ever be your brother. You are my very own now, and for ever.\" And he rushed at her again as though to envelop her in his arms, and to crush her against his bosom. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No!\" she exclaimed, avoiding him with the activity of a young fawn; \"not again. I had to beg your pardon, and it was so I did it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Twenty times you have offended me, and twenty times you must repeat your forgiveness.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, no, it must not be so. I was wrong to say that you were bloody-minded. I cannot tell why I said so. I would not for worlds have you altered in anything;—except,\" she said, \"in your love for me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But have you told me nothing?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have called you my hero,—and so you are.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nay, Edith, it is more than that. It is not for me to remind you, but it is more than that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She stood there blushing before him, over her cheeks and up to her forehead; but yet did not turn away her face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How am I to tell you why it is more than that? You cannot tell me,\" she replied. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But, Edith—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You cannot tell me. There are moments for some of us the feelings of which can never be whispered. You shall be my hero and my brother if you will; or my hero and my friend; or, if not that, my hero and my enemy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Never!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, my enemy you cannot be; for him who is about to revenge my brother\u0027s death no name less sweet than dearest friend will suffice. My hero and my dearest friend!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Then she took him by the hand, and turned away from the walk, and, escaping by a narrow path, was seen no more till she met him at dinner with her father and her brother and her sister. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By God! she shall be mine!\" said Clayton. \"She must be mine!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And then he went within, and, finding Hunter, read the details of the evidence for the trial of Mr. Lax in Dublin, as prepared by the proper officers in Galway city. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2744/75578.html","bookId":1377,"book":{"id":1377,"title":"The Landleaguers","description":"简介： In the year 1850 the two estates of Ballintubber and Morony were sold to Mr. Philip Jones, under the Estates Court, which had then been established.
