{"id":11409,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER IV. MR. BLAKE OF CARNLOUGH.","content":"Three or four days after the occurrences narrated in the last chapter, Mr. Jones got on to his car and had himself driven down to Carnlough, the seat of Mr. Thomas Blake, a gentleman living about two miles the other side of Tuam. To reach Carnlough he had a journey to make of about ten miles, and as he seldom went, in these days, so far away from home, the fact of his going was known to all the household. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Father is going to Carnlough,\" Florian said to Peter, the butler. \"What is he going for?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Deed, then, Master Flory, who can tell that? Mr. Blake is a very old friend of master\u0027s.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But why is he going now? It isn\u0027t often he goes to Carnlough; and when he does go, he is sure to say why.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I shouldn\u0027t wonder af he\u0027s going to ax him as to how he shall get rid of the waters.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He knows that better than Mr. Blake can tell him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Or maybe he\u0027s going to inquire how he shall cotch a hould of Pat Carroll.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was evident, from the butler\u0027s answers, that all the world at Morony Castle felt that at present Mr. Jones could engage himself on no other subject than that of the flood. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wish father wouldn\u0027t think so much about the flood. After all, what\u0027s ￡500? It won\u0027t ruin a man like my father.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But the butler showed by his visage that he regarded ￡500 as a very serious matter, and that he was not at all astonished by the occupation which it gave to his master\u0027s thoughts. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Blake, of Carnlough, was the first Irishman with whom Mr. Jones had become acquainted in the County Galway. It was through his instance, indeed, that the Morony and Ballintubber properties had been bought, so that the acquaintance must have been well established before the purchase had been made. Mr. Blake was a man of good property, who, in former years, had always been regarded as popular in the county. He was a Protestant, but had not made himself odious to the Roman Catholics around him as an Orangeman, nor had he ever been considered to be hard as a landlord. He thought, perhaps, a little too much of popularity, and had prided himself a little perhaps, on managing \"his boys\"—as he called the tenants—with peculiar skill. Even still he could boast of his success, though there had arisen some little difficulties as to rent over at Carnlough; and, indeed, he was frightened lest some of the evil ways which had begun to prevail in the neighbouring parts of County Mayo, should make their way into County Galway. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Blake and Mr. Jones had been very intimate. It had been at Mr. Blake\u0027s instance that Mr. Jones had been brought on to the Grand Jury. But latterly they had not seen very much of each other. Mr. Jones, since the death of his wife, did not go frequently to Galway, and Carnlough was a long distance for a morning\u0027s drive. But on this occasion Mr. Jones drove himself over simply with the view of making a morning call. \"Well, Jones, how are you;—and how are the girls, and how is Frank, and how is that young pickle, Master Florian?\" These questions were answered by others of a similar nature. \"How are the girls, and how is Mrs. Blake, and what is going on here at Carnlough?\" There was no inquiry after the eldest son, for it was Mr. Blake\u0027s misfortune that he had no male child to inherit his property. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Faith, then, things ain\u0027t going on a bit too well,\" said Mr. Blake. \"Abatement, abatement, nothing but abatement! Nobody abates me anything. I have to pay all family charges just the same as ever. What would they say if I was to take away my wife and girls, shut up Carnlough, and go and live in France? I could give them some abatement then and be a richer man. But how would they like to have Carnlough empty?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s no danger of that, I think.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Upon my word, I don\u0027t know. The girls are talking of it, and when they begin to talk of a thing, I am very likely to do it. And Mrs. Blake is quite ready.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You wouldn\u0027t leave the country?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s just it. I\u0027ll stay if they\u0027ll let me. If they\u0027ll pay me rent enough to enable me to live here comfortably, I\u0027ll not desert them. But if they think that I\u0027m to keep up the place on borrowed money, they\u0027ll find their mistake. I didn\u0027t mind ten per cent. for the last two years, though I have taken to drinking whisky punch in my old age, instead of claret and sherry. And I don\u0027t mind ten per cent. for this year, though I am sorely in want of a young horse to carry me. But if the ten per cent. is to go on, or to become twenty per cent. as one blackguard hinted, I shall say good-bye to Carnlough. They may fight it out then with Terry Daly as they can.\" Now, Terry Daly was the well-known agent for the lands of Carnlough. \"What has brought you over here to-day?\" asked Mr. Blake. \"I can see with half an eye that there is some fresh trouble.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Indeed there is.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have heard what they did with your sluices. That\u0027s another trick they\u0027ve learnt out of County Mayo. When a landlord is not rich enough to give them all that they want, they make the matter easier by doing the best they can to ruin him. I don\u0027t think anything of that kind has been done at Carnlough.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There is worse than that,\" said Mr. Jones sorrowfully. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The devil there is! They have not mutilated any of your cattle?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, there is nothing of that kind. The only enemy I\u0027ve got about the place, as far as I know, is one Pat Carroll. It was he and others, whom he paid to serve him, that have let the waters in upon the meadows. Eighty acres are under water at this moment. But I can bear that like a man. The worst of that is, that all the neighbours should have seen him do it, and not one of them have come forward to tell me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That is the worst,\" said Mr. Blake. \"There must be some terrible understanding among them, some compact for evil, when twenty men are afraid to tell what one man has been seen to do. It\u0027s fearful to think that the priests should not put a stop to it. How is Master Florian getting on with his priest?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s about him that I have come to speak to you,\" said Mr. Jones. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"About Florian?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; indeed. When I tell you my story, I think you will understand that I would tell it to no one but yourself in County Galway. I fear that Florian saw the men at work upon the flood gates.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And will he not tell the truth?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You must remember that I cannot say that I know anything. The boy declares that he saw nothing; that he knows nothing. I have no evidence; but his sisters are sure that it is so. Edith says that he certainly was present when the gates were removed. She only judges from his manner and his countenance.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What made her suspect him?\" asked Mr. Blake. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Only that she saw him when the news was brought to us. Edith is not ill-natured. She would not be prone to make a story against her brother.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If Edith says so, it is so,\" said Mr. Blake, who among all Edith\u0027s admirers was one of the most ardent. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t quite say that. I only mean to express my conviction that she intends to get at the truth.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll wager my life upon her,\" said Mr. Blake. \"As to the other;—well, you know, Jones, that he has turned Roman Catholic.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That means nothing,\" said the distressed father. \"He is only ten years old. Of course he\u0027s a fool for his pains; but he would not on that account do such a deed as this.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. You must remember that he will be telling everything to the priests.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We have two priests about us,\" said Mr. Jones, \"and I would trust them in anything. There is Father Giles at Headford, and he is as fair a man as any clergyman of our own could be. You cannot imagine that he would give such advice to my boy?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not Father Giles certainly,\" said the other man. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then down with us at Ballintubber there is Father Malachi.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know him too,\" said Mr. Blake. \"He would not interfere with a boy like Florian. Is there no one else? What curate lives with Father Malachi?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There is none with him at Ballintubber. One Brosnan lives with Father Giles.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That man is a firebrand,\" said Mr. Blake. \"He is a wretched politician, always preaching up Home Rule.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I do not think that even he would teach a boy to deceive his own father in such a matter as this.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am not sure,\" said Blake. \"It is very difficult to get at the vagaries of mind in such a man as Mr. Brosnan. But what do you intend to do?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have come to you for advice. But remember this:—in my present frame of mind, the suspicion that I feel as to poor Florian is ten times worse to me than the loss of all my meadows. If I could find out Edith to have been wrong, I should be at once relieved of the great trouble which sits heaviest at my heart.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I fear that Edith is right,\" said Mr. Blake. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are prejudiced a little in her favour. Whatever she says you will think right.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You must weigh that, and take it for what it\u0027s worth,\" said Mr. Blake. \"We know that the boy has got himself into bad hands. You do not suspect him of a desire to injure you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, no!\" said the father. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But he has seen these men do it, and now refuses to tell you. They have terrified him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He is not a cowardly boy,\" said Mr. Jones, still standing up for his son. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But they have made him swear an oath that he will not tell. There has been something of that sort. What does he say himself?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Simply that he knows nothing about it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But how does he say it? Does he look you in the face? A boy of that kind may lie. Boys do—and girls also. When people say they don\u0027t, they know nothing about it; but if it\u0027s worth one\u0027s while to look at them one can generally tell when they\u0027re lying. I\u0027m not a bit afraid of a boy when he is lying,—but only of one who can lie as though he didn\u0027t lie.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think that Florian is lying,\" said Mr. Jones slowly; \"he does not look me in the face, and he does not lie straightforward.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then Edith is right; and I am right when I swear by her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But what am I to do with him? If, as I suppose, he saw Pat Carroll do the mischief, he must have seen others with him. If we knew who were the lot, we could certainly get the truth out of some of them, so as to get evidence for a conviction.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can\u0027t he be made to speak?\" asked Mr. Blake. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How can I make him? It will be understood all about Morony that he has been lying. And I feel that it is thought that he has made himself a hero by sticking to his lie. If they should turn upon him?\" Mr. Blake sat silent but made no immediate reply. \"It would be better for me to let the whole thing slide. If they were to kill him!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They would not do that. Here in County Galway they have not come to that as yet. There is not a county in all Ireland in which such a deed could be done,\" said Mr. Blake, standing up for his country. \"Are you to let this ruffian pass unpunished while you have the power of convicting him? I think that you are bound to punish him. For the sake of your country you are bound to do so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And the boy?\" said Mr. Jones hoarsely. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He is but ten years old, and will soon live it down. And the disgrace of the lie will be drowned in the triumph of telling the truth at last. We should all feel,—I should feel,—that he would in such case deserve well, rather than ill, of his father and of me, and of all of us. Besides you had some idea of sending him to school in England.\" Here Mr. Jones shook his head, intending to indicate that no such expensive step as that would be possible after the loss incurred by the flooding of the eighty acres. \"At any rate my advice to you is to make him declare the truth. I think little harm of a boy for lying, but I do think harm of those who allow a lie to pass unnoticed.\" So saying Mr. Blake ended the meeting, and took Mr. Jones away to see Mrs. Blake and the girls. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do suppose that father has gone to Carnlough, to consult with Mr. Blake about this affair of the flood.\" It was thus that Ada spoke to her brother Florian, when he came to her discussing the matter of their father\u0027s absence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What can Mr. Blake know about it?\" said Florian. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose he means to ask about you. It is quite clear, Florian, that no one in the house believes you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Peter does.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You mean that Peter thinks you are right to stand to the lie now you have told it. More shame for Peter if he does.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You wouldn\u0027t have a fellow go and put himself out of favour with all the boys through the country? There is a horrible man that wears a mask—\" Then he remembered, and stopped himself. He was on closer terms with Ada than with Edith, but not on terms so close as to justify his whispering a word about the man in the mask. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where did you see the man in the mask?\" asked Ada. \"Who is the man in the mask?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But you know where you saw him. You must know that. What did the man in the mask say to you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am not going to tell you anything about him,\" said the boy. \"I am not going to have my secrets got out of me in that way. It isn\u0027t honest. Nobody but a Protestant would do it.\" So saying Florian left his sister, with the tale of the man in the mask only half told. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2744/75542.html","bookId":1377,"book":{"id":1377,"title":"The Landleaguers","description":"简介： In the year 1850 the two estates of Ballintubber and Morony were sold to Mr. Philip Jones, under the Estates Court, which had then been established.
