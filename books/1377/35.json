{"id":11440,"no":35,"title":"CHAPTER XXXV. MR. O\u0027MAHONY\u0027S APOLOGY.","content":"Time went on and Parliament met. Mr. O\u0027Mahony went before the Speaker\u0027s table and was sworn in. He was introduced by two brother Landleaguers, and really did take his place with some enthusiasm. He wanted to speak on the first day, but was judiciously kept silent by his colleagues. He expressed an idea that, until Ireland\u0027s wrongs had been redressed, there ought not to be a moment devoted to any other subject, and became very violent in his expressions of this opinion. But he was not long kept dumb. Great things were expected from his powers of speech, and, though he had to be brought to silence ignominiously on three or four occasions, still, at last some power of speech was permitted to him. There were those among his own special brethren who greatly admired him and praised him; but with others of the same class there was a shaking of the head and many doubts. With the House generally, I fear, laughter prevailed rather than true admiration. Mr. O\u0027Mahony, no doubt, could speak well in a debating society or a music hall. Words came from his tongue sweeter than honey. But just at the beginning of the session, the Speaker was bound to put a limit even to Irish eloquence, and in this case was able to do so. As Mr. O\u0027Mahony contrived to get upon his feet very frequently, either in asking a question or in endeavouring to animadvert on the answer given, there was something of a tussle between him and the authority in the chair. It did not take much above a week to make the Speaker thoroughly tired of this new member, and threats were used towards him of a nature which his joint Milesian and American nature could not stand. He was told of dreadful things which could be done to him. Though as yet he could not be turned out of the House, for the state of the young session had not as yet admitted of that new mode of torture, still, he could be named. \"Let him name me. My name is Mr. O\u0027Mahony.\" And Mr. O\u0027Mahony was not a man who could be happy when he was quarrelling with all around him. He was soon worked into a violent passion, in which he made himself ridiculous, but when he had subsided, and the storm was past, he knew he had misbehaved, and was unhappy. And, as he was thoroughly honest, he could not be got to obey his leaders in everything. He wanted to abolish the Irish landlords, but he was desirous of abolishing them after some special plan of his own, and could hardly be got to work efficiently in harness together with others. \n \n \"Don\u0027t you think your father is making an ass of himself,—just a little, you know?\" \n \n This was said by Lord Castlewell to Rachel when the session was not yet a fortnight old, and made Rachel very unhappy. She did think that her father was making an ass of himself, but she did not like to be told of it. And much as she liked music herself, dear as was her own profession to her, still she felt that, to be a Member of Parliament, and to have achieved the power of making speeches there, was better than to run after opera singers. She loved the man who was going to marry her very well,—or rather, she intended to do so. \n \n He was not to her \"Love\u0027s young dream.\" But she intended that his lordship should become love\u0027s old reality. She felt that this would not become the case, if love\u0027s old reality were to tell her often that her father was an ass. Lord Castlewell\u0027s father was, she thought, making an ass of himself. She heard on different sides that he was a foolish, pompous old peer, who could hardly say bo to a goose; but it would not, she thought, become her to tell her future husband her own opinion on that matter. She saw no reason why he should be less reticent in his opinion as to her father. Of course he was older, and perhaps she did not think of that as much as she ought to have done. She ought also to have remembered that he was an earl, and she but a singing girl, and that something was due to him for the honour he was doing her. But of this she would take no account. She was to be his wife, and a wife ought to be equal to the husband. Such at least was her American view of the matter. In fact, her ideas on the matter ran as follows: My future husband is not entitled to call my father an ass because he is a lord, seeing that my father is a Member of Parliament. Nor is he entitled to call him so because he is an ass, because the same thing is true of his own father. And thus there came to be discord in her mind. \n \n \"I suppose all Parliament people make asses of themselves sometimes, Lords as well as Commons. I don\u0027t see how a man is to go on talking for ever about laws and landleagues, and those sort of things without doing so. It is all bosh to me. And so I should think it must be to you, as you don\u0027t do it. But I do not think that father is worse than anybody else; and I think that his words are sometimes very beautiful.\" \n \n \"Why, my dear, there is not a man about London who is not laughing at him.\" \n \n \"I saw in The Times the other day that he is considered a very true and a very honest man. Of course, they said that he talked nonsense sometimes; but if you put the honesty against the nonsense, he will be as good as anybody else.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t think you understand, my dear. Honesty is not what they want.\" \n \n \"Oh!\" \n \n \"But what they don\u0027t want especially is nonsense.\" \n \n \"Poor papa! But he doesn\u0027t mean to consult them as to what they want. His idea is that if everybody can be got to be honest this question may be settled among them. But it must be talked about, and he, at any rate, is eloquent. I have heard it said that there was not a more eloquent man in New York. I think he has got as many good gifts as anyone else.\" \n \n In this way there rose some bad feeling. Lord Castlewell did think that there was something wanting in the manner in which he was treated by his bride. He was sure that he loved her, but he was sure also that when a lord marries a singing girl he ought to expect some special observance. And the fact that the singing girl\u0027s father was a Member of Parliament was much less to him than to her. He, indeed, would have been glad to have the father abolished altogether. But she had become very proud of her father since he had become a Member of Parliament. Her ideas of the British constitution were rather vague; but she thought that a Member of Parliament was at least as good as a lord who was not a peer. He had his wealth; but she was sure that he was too proud to think of that. \n \n Just at this period, when the session was beginning, Rachel began to doubt the wisdom of what she was doing. The lord was, in truth, good enough for her. He was nearly double her age, but she had determined to disregard that. He was plain, but that was of no moment. He had run after twenty different women, but she could condone all that, because he had come at last to run after her. For his wealth she cared nothing,—or less than nothing, because by remaining single she could command wealth of her own;—wealth which she could control herself, and keep at her own banker\u0027s, which she suspected would not be the case with Lord Castlewell\u0027s money. But she had found the necessity of someone to lean upon when Frank Jones had told her that he would not marry her, and she had feared Mr. Moss so much that she had begun to think that he would, in truth, frighten her into doing some horrible thing. As Frank had deserted her, it would be better that she should marry somebody. Lord Castlewell had come, and she had felt that the fates were very good to her. She learned from the words of everybody around,—from her new friends at Covent Garden, and from her old enemies at \"The Embankment,\" and from her father himself, that she was the luckiest singing girl at this moment known in Europe. \"By G——, she\u0027ll get him!\" such had been the exclamation made with horror by Mr. Moss, and the echo of it had found its way to her ears. The more Mr. Moss was annoyed, the greater ought to have been her delight. But,—but was she in truth delighted? As she came to think of the reality she asked herself what were the pleasures which were promised to her. Did she not feel that a week spent with Frank Jones in some little cottage would be worth a twelvemonth of golden splendour in the \"Marble Halls\" which Lord Castlewell was supposed to own? And why had Frank deserted her? Simply because he would not come with her and share her money. Frank, she told herself, was, in truth, a gallant fellow. She did love Frank. She acknowledged so much to herself again and again. And yet she was about to marry Lord Castlewell, simply because her doing so would be the severest possible blow to her old enemy, Mr. Moss. \n \n Then she asked herself what would be best for her. She had made for herself a great reputation, and she did not scruple to tell herself that this had come from her singing. She thought very much of her singing, but very little of her beauty. A sort of prettiness did belong to her; a tiny prettiness which had sufficed to catch Frank Jones. She had laughed about her prettiness and her littleness a score of times with Ada and Edith, and also with Frank himself. There had been the three girls who had called themselves \"Beauty and the Beast\" and the \"Small young woman.\" The reader will understand that it had not been Ada who had chosen those names; but then Ada was not given to be witty. Her prettiness, such as it was, had sufficed, and Frank had loved her dearly. Then had come her great triumph, and she knew not only that she could sing, but that the world had recognised her singing. \"I am a great woman, as women go,\" she had said to herself. But her singing was to come to an end for ever and ever on the 1st of May next. She would be the Countess of Castlewell, and in process of time would be the Marchioness of Beaulieu. But she never again would be a great woman. She was selling all that for the marble halls. \n \n Was she wise in what she was doing? She had lain awake one long morning striving to answer the question for herself. \"If nobody else should come, of course I should be an ugly old maid,\" she said to herself; \"but then Frank might perhaps come again,—Frank might come again,—if Mr. Moss did not intervene in the meantime.\" But at last she acknowledged to herself that she had given the lord a promise. She would keep her promise, but she could not bring herself to exult at the prospect. She must take care, however, that the lord should not triumph over her. The lord had called her father an ass. She certainly would say a rough word or two if he abused her father again. \n \n This was the time of the \"suspects.\" Mr. O\u0027Mahony had already taken an opportunity of expressing an opinion in the House of Commons that every honest man, every patriotic man, every generous man, every man in fact who was worth his salt, was in Ireland locked up as a \"suspect,\" and in saying so managed to utter very bitter words indeed respecting him who had the locking up of these gentlemen. Poor Mr. O\u0027Mahony had no idea that he might have used with propriety as to this gentleman all the epithets of which he believed the \"suspects\" to be worthy; but instead of doing so he called him a \"disreputable jailer.\" It is not pleasant to be called a disreputable jailer in the presence of all the best of one\u0027s fellow citizens, but the man so called in this instance only smiled. Mr. O\u0027Mahony had certainly made himself ridiculous, and the whole House were loud in their clamours at the words used. But that did not suffice. The Speaker reprimanded Mr. O\u0027Mahony and desired him to recall the language and apologise for it. Then there arose a loud debate, during which the member of the Government who had been assailed declared that Mr. O\u0027Mahony had not as yet been quite long enough in the House to learn the little details of Parliamentary language; Mr. O\u0027Mahony would no doubt soften down his eloquence in course of time. But the Speaker would not be content with this, and was about to order the sinner to be carried away by the Sergeant-at-Arms, when a friend on his right and a friend on his left, and a friend behind him, all whispered into his ear how easy it is to apologise in the House of Commons. \"You needn\u0027t say he isn\u0027t a disreputable jailer, but only call him a distasteful warder;—anything will do.\" This came from the gentleman at Mr. O\u0027Mahony\u0027s back, and the order for his immediate expulsion was ringing in his ears. He had been told that he was ridiculous, and could feel that it would be absurd to be carried somewhere into the dungeons. And the man whom he certainly detested at the present moment worse than any other scoundrel on the earth, had made a good-natured apology on his behalf. If he were carried away now, he could never come back again without a more serious apology. Then, farewell to all power of attacking the jailer. He did as the man whispered into his ear, and begged to substitute \"distasteful warder\" for the words which had wounded so cruelly the feelings of the right honourable gentleman. Then he looked round the House, showing that he thought that he had misbehaved himself. After that, during Mr. O\u0027Mahony\u0027s career as a Member of Parliament, which lasted only for the session, he lost his self-respect altogether. He had been driven to withdraw the true wrath of his eloquence from him \"at whose brow,\" as he told Rachel the next morning, \"he had hurled his words with a force that had been found to be intolerable.\" \n \n Mr. O\u0027Mahony had undoubtedly made himself an ass again on this second, third, and perhaps tenth occasion. This was not the ass he had made himself on the occasion to which Lord Castlewell had referred. But yet he was a thoroughly honest, patriotic man, desirous only of the good of his country, and wishing for nothing for himself. Is it not possible that as much may be said for others, who from day to day so violently excite our spleen, as to make us feel that special Irishmen selected for special constituencies are not worthy to be ranked with men? You shall take the whole House of Commons, indifferent as to the side on which they sit,—some six hundred and thirty out of the number,—and will find in conversation that the nature of the animal, the absurdity, the selfishness, the absence of all good qualifies, are taken for granted as matters admitting of no dispute. But here was Mr. O\u0027Mahony, as hot a Home-Ruler and Landleaguer as any of them, who was undoubtedly a gentleman,—though an American gentleman. Can it be possible that we are wrong in our opinions respecting the others of the set? \n \n Rachel heard it all the next day, and, living as she did among Italians and French, and theatrical Americans, and English swells, could not endeavour to make the apology which I have just made for the Irish Brigade generally. She knew that her father had made an ass of himself. All the asinine proportions of the affair had been so explained to her as to leave no doubt on her mind as to the matter. But the more she was sure of it, the more resolved she became that Lord Castlewell should not call her father an ass. She might do so,—and undoubtedly would after her own fashion,—but no such privilege should be allowed to him. \n \n \"Oh! father, father,\" she said to him the next morning, \"don\u0027t you think you\u0027ve made a goose of yourself?\" \n \n \"Yes, I do.\" \n \n \"Then, don\u0027t do it any more.\" \n \n \"Yes, I shall. It isn\u0027t so very easy for a man not to make a goose of himself in that place. You\u0027ve got to sit by and do nothing for a year or two. It is very difficult. A man cannot afford to waste his time in that manner. There is all Ireland to be regenerated, and I have to learn the exact words which the prudery of the House of Commons will admit. Of course I have made a goose of myself; but the question is whether I did not make a knave of myself in apologising for language which was undoubtedly true. Only think that a man so brutal, so entirely without feelings, without generosity, without any touch of sentiment, should be empowered by the Queen of England to lock up, not only every Irishman, but every American also, and to keep them there just as long as he pleases! And he revels in it. I do believe that he never eats a good breakfast unless half-a-dozen new \u0027suspects\u0027 are reported by the early police in the morning; and I am not to call such a man a \u0027disreputable jailer.\u0027 I may call him a \u0027distasteful warder.\u0027 It\u0027s a disgrace to a man to sit in such a House and in such company. Of course I was a goose, but I was only a goose according to the practices of that special duck-pond.\" Mr. O\u0027Mahony, as he said this, walked about angrily, with his hands in his breeches\u0027 pockets, and told himself that no honest man could draw the breath of life comfortably except in New York. \n \n \"I don\u0027t know much about it, father,\" said Rachel, \"but I think you\u0027d better cut and run. Your twenty men will never do any good here. Everybody hates them who has got any money, and their only friends are just men as Mr. Pat Carroll, of Ballintubber.\" \n \n Then, later in the day, Lord Castlewell called to drive his bride in the Park. He had so far overcome family objections as to have induced his sister, Lady Augusta Montmorency, to accompany him. Lady Augusta had been already introduced to Rachel, but had not been much prepossessed. Lady Augusta was very proud of her family, was a religious woman, and was anything but contented with her brother\u0027s manner of life. But it was no doubt better that he should marry Rachel than not be married at all; and therefore Lady Augusta had allowed herself to be brought to accompany the singing girl upon this occasion. She was, in truth, an uncommonly good young woman; not beautiful, not clever, but most truly anxious for the welfare of her brother. It had been represented to her that her brother was over head and ears in love with the young lady, and looking at the matter all round, she had thought it best to move a little from her dignity so as to take her sister-in-law coldly by the hand. It need hardly be said that Rachel did not like being taken coldly by the hand, and, with her general hot mode of expression, would have declared that she hated Augusta Montmorency. Now, the two entered the room together, and Rachel kissed Lady Augusta, while she gave only her hand to Lord Castlewell. But there was something in her manner on such occasions which was intended to show affection,—and did show it very plainly. In old days she could decline to kiss Frank in a manner that would set Frank all on fire. It was as much as to say—of course you\u0027ve a right to it, but on this occasion I don\u0027t mean to give it to you. But Lord Castlewell was not imaginative, and did not think of all this. Rachel had intended him to think of it. \n \n \"Oh, my goodness!\" began the lord, \"what a mess your father did make of it last night.\" And he frowned as he spoke. \n \n Rachel, as an intended bride—about to be a bride in two or three months—did not like to be frowned at by the man who was to marry her. \"That\u0027s as people may think, my lord,\" she said. \n \n \"You don\u0027t mean to say that you don\u0027t think he did make a mess of it?\" \n \n \"Of course he abused that horrid man. Everybody is abusing him.\" \n \n \"As for that, I\u0027m not going to defend the man.\" For Lord Castlewell, though by no means a strong politician, was a Tory, and unfortunately found himself agreeing with Rachel in abusing the members of the Government. \n \n \"Then why do you say that father made a mess of it?\" \n \n \"Everybody is talking about it. He has made himself ridiculous before the whole town.\" \n \n \"What! Lord Castlewell,\" exclaimed Rachel. \n \n \"I do believe your father is the best fellow going; but he ought not to touch politics. He made a great mistake in getting into the House. It is a source of misery to everyone connected with him.\" \n \n \"Or about to be connected with him,\" said Lady Augusta, who had not been appeased by the flavour of Rachel\u0027s kiss. \n \n \"There\u0027s time enough to think about it yet,\" said Rachel. \n \n \"No, there\u0027s not,\" said Lord Castlewell, who intended to express in rather a gallant manner his intention of going on with the marriage. \n \n \"But I can assure you there is,\" said Rachel, \"ample time. There shall be no time for going on with it, if my father is to be abused. As it happens, you don\u0027t agree with my father in politics. I, as a woman, should have to call myself as belonging to your party, if we be ever married. I do not know what that party is, and care very little, as I am not a politician myself. And I suppose if we were married, you would take upon yourself to abuse my father for his politics, as he might abuse you. But while he is my father, and you are not my husband, I will not bear it. No, thank you, Lady Augusta, I will not drive out to-day. \u0027Them\u0027s my sentiments,\u0027 as people say; and perhaps your brother had better think them over while there\u0027s time enough.\" So saying, she did pertinaciously refuse to be driven by the noble lord on that occasion. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2744/75573.html","bookId":1377,"book":{"id":1377,"title":"The Landleaguers","description":"简介： In the year 1850 the two estates of Ballintubber and Morony were sold to Mr. Philip Jones, under the Estates Court, which had then been established.
