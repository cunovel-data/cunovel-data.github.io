{"id":11429,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV. \"FROM THE FULL HEART THE MOUTH SPEAKS.\"","content":"Ada was making the beds upstairs, and Edith was churning the butter down below in the dairy, when a little bare-footed boy came in with a letter. \n \n \"Please, miss, it\u0027s from the Captain, and he says I\u0027m not to stir out of this till I come back with an answer.\" \n \n The letter was delivered to Edith at the dairy door, and she saw that it was addressed to herself. She had never before seen the Captain\u0027s handwriting, and she looked at it somewhat curiously. \"If he\u0027s to write to one of us it should be to Ada,\" she said to herself, laughing. Then she opened the envelope, which enclosed a large square stout letter. It contained a card and a written note, and on the card was an invitation, as follows: \"The Colonel and Officers of the West Bromwich Regiment request the pleasure of the company of Mr. Jones, the Misses Jones, and Mr. Francis Jones to a dance at the Galway Barracks, on the 20th of May, 1881. Dancing to commence at ten o\u0027clock.\" \n \n Then there was the note, which Edith read before she took the card upstairs. \n \n \"My dear Miss Jones,\" the letter began. Edith again looked at the envelope and perceived that the despatch had been certainly addressed to herself—Miss Edith Jones; but between herself and her sister there could be no jealousy as to the opening of a letter. Letters for one were generally intended for the other also. \n \n \n I hope you will both come. You ought to do so to show the county that, though you are boycotted, you are not smashed, and to let them understand that you are not afraid to come out of the house although certain persons have made themselves terrible. I send this to you instead of to your sister, because perhaps you have a little higher pluck. But do tell your father from me that I think he ought, as a matter of policy, to insist on your both coming. You could come down by the boat one day and return the next; and I\u0027ll meet you, for fear your brother should not be there.—Yours very faithfully, \n \n Yorke Clayton. \n \n I have got the fellows of the West Bromwich to entrust the card to me, and have undertaken to see it duly delivered. I hope you\u0027ll approve of my Mercury. Hunter says he doesn\u0027t care how often he\u0027s shot at. \n \n \n It was, in the first place, necessary to provide for the Mercury, because even a god cannot be sent away after the performance of such a journey without some provisions; and Edith, to tell the truth, wanted to look at the ball all round before she ventured to express an opinion to her sister and father. Her father, of course, would not go; but should he be left alone at Morony Castle to the tender mercies of Peter? and should Florian be left also without any woman\u0027s hands to take charge of him? And the butter, too, was on the point of coming, which was a matter of importance. But at last, having pulled off her butter-making apron and having duly patted the roll of butter, she went upstairs to her sister. \n \n \"Ada,\" she said, \"here is such a letter;\" and she held up the letter and the card. \n \n \"Who is it from?\" \n \n \"You must guess,\" said Edith. \n \n \"I am bad at guessing, I cannot guess. Is it Mr. Blake of Carnlough?\" \n \n \"A great deal more interesting than that.\" \n \n \"It can\u0027t be Captain Clayton,\" said Ada. \n \n \"Out of the full heart the mouth speaks. It is Captain Clayton.\" \n \n \"What does he say, and what is the card? Give it me. It looks like an invitation.\" \n \n \"Then it tells no story, because it is an invitation. It is from the officers of the West Bromwich regiment; and it asks us to a dance on the 20th of May.\" \n \n \"But that\u0027s not from Captain Clayton.\" \n \n \"Captain Clayton has written,—to me and not to you at all. You will be awfully jealous; and he says that I have twice as much courage as you.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s true, at any rate,\" said Ada, in a melancholy tone. \n \n \"Yes; and as the officers want all the girls at the ball to be at any rate as brave as themselves, that\u0027s a matter of great importance. He has asked me to go with a pair of pistols at my belt; but he is afraid that you would not shoot anybody.\" \n \n \"May I not look at his letter?\" \n \n \"Oh, no! That would not be at all proper. The letter is addressed to me, Miss Edith Jones. And as it has come from such a very dashing young man, and pays me particular compliments as to my courage, I don\u0027t think I shall let anybody else see it. It doesn\u0027t say anything special about beauty, which I think uncivil. If he had been writing to you, it would all have been about feminine loveliness of course.\" \n \n \"What nonsense you do talk, Edith.\" \n \n \"Well, there it is. As you will read it, you must. You\u0027ll be awfully disappointed, because there is not a word about you in it.\" \n \n Then Ada read the letter. \"He says he hopes we shall both come.\" \n \n \"Well, yes! Your existence is certainly implied in those words.\" \n \n \"He explains why he writes to you instead of me.\" \n \n \"Another actual reference to yourself, no doubt. But then he goes on to talk of my pluck.\" \n \n \"He says it\u0027s a little higher than mine,\" said Ada, who was determined to extract from the Captain\u0027s words as much good as was possible, and as little evil to herself. \n \n \"So it is; only a little higher pluck! Of course he means that I can\u0027t come near himself.\" \n \n \"You wouldn\u0027t pretend to?\" asked Ada. \n \n \"What! to be shot at like him, and to like it. I don\u0027t know any girl that can come quite up to that. Only if one becomes quite cock-sure, as he is, that one won\u0027t be hit, I don\u0027t see the courage.\" \n \n \"Oh, I do!\" \n \n \"But now about this ball?\" said Edith. \"Here we are, lone damsels, making butter in our father\u0027s halls, and turning down the beds in the lady\u0027s chamber, unable to buy anything because we are boycotted, and with no money to buy it if we were not. And we can\u0027t stir out of the house lest we should be shot, and I don\u0027t suppose that such a thing as a pair of gloves is to be got anywhere.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ve got gloves for both of us,\" said Ada. \n \n \"Put by for a rainy day. What a girl you are for providing for difficulties! And you\u0027ve got silk stockings too, I shouldn\u0027t wonder.\" \n \n \"Of course I have.\" \n \n \"And two ball dresses, quite new?\" \n \n \"Not quite new. They are those we wore at Hacketstown before the flood.\" \n \n \"Good gracious! How were Noah\u0027s daughters dressed? Or were they dressed at all?\" \n \n \"You always turn everything into nonsense,\" said Ada, petulantly. \n \n \"To be told I\u0027m to wear a dress that had touched the heart of a patriarch, and had perhaps gone well nigh to make me a patriarch\u0027s bride! But taking it for granted that the ball dresses with all their appurtenances are here, fit to win the heart of a modern Captain instead of an old patriarch, is there no other reason why we should not go?\" \n \n \"What reason?\" asked Ada, in a melancholy tone. \n \n \"There are reasons. You go to papa, and see whether he has not reasons. He will tell you that every shilling should be saved for Florian\u0027s school.\" \n \n \"It won\u0027t take many shillings to go to Galway. We couldn\u0027t well write to Captain Clayton and tell him that we can\u0027t afford it.\" \n \n \"People keep those reasons in the background,\" said Edith, \"though people understand them. And then papa will say that in our condition we ought to be ashamed to show our faces.\" \n \n \"What have we done amiss?\" \n \n \"Not you or I perhaps,\" said Edith; \"but poor Florian. I am determined,—and so are you,—to take Florian to our very hearts, and to forgive him as though this thing had never been done. He is to us the same darling boy, as though he had never been present at the flood gates; as though he had had no hand in bringing these evils to Morony Castle. You and I have been angry, but we have forgiven him. To us he is as dear as ever he was. But they know in the county what it was that was done by Florian Jones, and they talk about it among themselves, and they speak of you and me as Florian\u0027s sisters. And they speak of papa as Florian\u0027s father. I think it may well be that papa should not wish us to go to this ball.\" \n \n Then there came a look of disappointment over Ada\u0027s face, as though her doom had already been spoken. A ball to Ada, and especially a ball at Galway,—a coming ball,—was a promise of infinite enjoyment; but a ball with Captain Yorke Clayton would be heaven on earth. And by the way in which this invitation had come he had been secured as a partner for the evening. He could not write to them, and especially call upon them to come without doing all he could to make the evening pleasant for them. She included Edith in all these promises of pleasantness. But Edith, if the thing was to be done at all, would do it all for Ada. As for the danger in which the man passed his life, that must be left in the hands of God. Looking at it with great seriousness, as in the midst of her joking she did look at these things, she told herself that Ada was very lovely, and that this man was certainly lovable. And she had taken it into her imagination that Captain Clayton was certainly in the road to fall in love with Ada. Why should not Ada have her chance? And why should not the Captain have his? Why should not she have her chance of having a gallant lovable gentleman for a brother-in-law? Edith was not at all prepared to give the world up for lost, because Pat Carroll had made himself a brute, and because the neighbours were idiots and had boycotted them. It must all depend upon their father, whether they should or should not go to the ball. And she had not thought it prudent to appear too full of hope when talking of it to Ada; but for herself she quite agreed with the Captain that policy required them to go. \n \n \"I suppose you would like it?\" she said to her sister. \n \n \"I always was fond of dancing,\" replied Ada. \n \n \"Especially with heroes.\" \n \n \"Of course you laugh at me, but Captain Clayton won\u0027t be there as an officer; he\u0027s only a resident magistrate.\" \n \n \"He\u0027s the best of all the officers,\" said Edith with enthusiasm. \"I won\u0027t have our hero run down. I believe him to have twice as much in him as any of the officers. He\u0027s the gallantest fellow I know. I think we ought to go, if it\u0027s only because he wants it.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t want not to go,\" said Ada. \n \n \"I daresay not; but papa will be the difficulty.\" \n \n \"He\u0027ll think more of you than of me, Edith. Suppose you go and talk to him.\" \n \n So it was decided; and Edith went away to her father, leaving Ada still among the beds. Of Frank not a word had been spoken. Frank would go as a matter of course if Mr. Jones consented. But Ada, though she was left among the beds, did not at once go on with her work; but sat down on that special bed by which her attention was needed, and thought of the circumstances which surrounded her. Was it a fact that she was in love with the Captain? To be in love to her was a very serious thing,—but so delightful. She had been already once,—well, not in love, but preoccupied just a little in thinking of one young man. The one young man was an officer, but was now in India, and Ada had not ventured even to mention his name in her father\u0027s presence. Edith had of course known the secret, but Edith had frowned upon it. She had said that Lieutenant Talbot was no better than a stick, although he had ￡400 a year of his own. \"He\u0027d give you nothing to talk about,\" said Edith, \"but his ￡400 a year.\" Therefore when Lieutenant Talbot went to India, Ada Jones did not break her heart. But now Edith called Captain Clayton a hero, and seemed in all respects to approve of him; and Edith seemed to think that he certainly admired Ada. It was a dreadful thing to have to fall in love with a woodcock. Ada felt that if, as things went on, the woodcock should become her woodcock, the bullet which reached his heart would certainly pierce her own bosom also. But such was the way of the world. Edith had seemed to think that the man was entitled to have a lady of his own to love; and if so, Ada seemed to think that the place would be one very well suited to herself. Therefore she was anxious for the ball; and at the present moment thought only of the difficulties to be incurred by Edith in discussing the matter with her father. \n \n \"Papa, Captain Clayton wants us to go to a ball at Galway,\" it was thus that Edith began her task. \n \n \"Wants you to go a ball! What has Captain Clayton to do with you two?\" \n \n \"Nothing on earth;—at any rate not with me. Here is his letter, which speaks for itself. He seems to think that we should show ourselves to everybody around, to let them know that we are not crushed by what such a one as Pat Carroll can do to us.\" \n \n \"Who says that we are crushed?\" \n \n \"It is the people who are crushed that generally say so of themselves. There would be nothing unusual under ordinary circumstances in your daughters going to a ball at Galway.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s as may be.\" \n \n \"We can stay the night at Mrs. D\u0027Arcy\u0027s, and she will be delighted to have us. If we never show ourselves it would be as though we acknowledged ourselves to be crushed. And to tell the truth, papa, I don\u0027t think it is quite fair to Ada to keep her here always. She is very beautiful, and at the same time fond of society. She is doing her duty here bravely; there is nothing about the house that she will not put her hand to. She is better than any servant for the way she does her work. I think you ought to let her go; it is but for the one night.\" \n \n \"And you?\" asked the father. \n \n \"I must go with her, I suppose, to keep her company.\" \n \n \"And are not you fond of society?\" \n \n \"No;—not as she is. I like the rattle very well just for a few minutes.\" \n \n \"And are not you beautiful?\" he asked. \n \n \"Good gracious, no! Don\u0027t be such a goose, papa.\" \n \n \"To me you are quite as lovely as is Ada.\" \n \n \"Because you are only a stupid, old papa,\" but she kissed him as she said it. \"You have no right to expect to have two beauties in the family. If I were a beauty I should go away and leave you, as will Ada. It\u0027s her destiny to be carried off by someone. Why not by some of these gallant fellows at Galway? It\u0027s my destiny to remain at home; and so you may know what you have got to expect.\" \n \n \"If it should turn out to be so, there will be one immeasurable comfort to me in the midst of all my troubles.\" \n \n \"It shall be so,\" said she, whispering into his ear. \"But, papa, you will let us go to this ball in Galway, will you not? Ada has set her heart upon it.\" So the matter was settled. \n \n The answer to Captain Clayton, sent by Edith, was as follows; but it was not sent till the boy had been allowed to stuff himself with buttered toast and tea, which, to such a boy, is the acme of all happiness. \n \n \n Morony Castle, 8th of May, 1881. \n \n Dear Captain Clayton, \n \n We will both come, of course, and are infinitely obliged to you for the trouble you have taken on our behalf. Papa will not come, of course. Frank will, no doubt; but he is out after a salmon in the Hacketstown river. I hope he will get one, as we are badly off for provisions. If he cannot find a salmon, I hope he will find trout, or we shall have nothing for three days running. Ada and I think we can manage a leg of mutton between us, as far as the cooking goes, but we haven\u0027t had a chance of trying our hands yet. Frank, however, will write to the officers by post. We shall sleep the night at Mrs. D\u0027Arcy\u0027s, and can get there very well by ourselves. All the same, we shall be delighted to see you, if you will come down to the boat. \n \n Yours very truly, \n \n Edith Jones. \n \n I must tell you what Ada said about our dresses, only pray don\u0027t tell any of the officers. Of course we had to have a consultation about our frocks, because everything in the shops is boycotted for us. \"Oh,\" said Ada, \"there are the gauze dresses we wore at Hacketstown before the flood!\" Only think of Ada and I at a ball with the Miss Noahs, four or five thousand years ago. \n \n \n Frank consented to go of course, but not without some little difficulty. He didn\u0027t think it was a time for balls. According to his view of things ginger should be no longer hot in the mouth. \n \n \"But why not?\" said Edith. \"If a ball at any time is a good thing, why should it be bad now? Are we all to go into mourning, because Mr. Carroll has so decreed? For myself I don\u0027t care twopence for the ball. I don\u0027t think it is worth the ten shillings which it will cost. But I am all for showing that we don\u0027t care so much for Mr. Carroll.\" \n \n \"Carroll is in prison,\" said Frank. \n \n \"Nor yet for Terry Lax, or Tim Brady, or Terry Carroll, or Tony Brady. The world is not to be turned away from its proper course by such a scum of men as that. Of course you\u0027ll do as a brother should do, and come with us.\" \n \n To this Frank assented, and on the next day went out for another salmon, thinking no more about the party at Galway. \n \n But the party at Galway was a matter of infinite trouble and infinite interest to the two girls. Those dresses which had been put by from before the flood were brought forth, and ironed, and re-ribboned, and re-designed, as though the fate of heroes and heroines depended upon them. And it was clearly intended that the fate of one hero and of one heroine should depend on them, though nothing absolutely to that effect was said at present between the sisters. It was not said, but it was understood by both of them that it was so; and each understood what was in the heart of the other. \"Dear, dear Edith,\" said Ada. \"Let them boycott us as they will,\" said Edith, \"but my pet shall be as bright as any of them.\" There was a ribbon that had not been tossed, a false flower that had on it something of the bloom of newness. A faint offer was made by Ada to abandon some of these prettinesses to her sister, but Edith would have none of them. Edith pooh-poohed the idea as though it were monstrous. \"Don\u0027t be a goose, Ada,\" she said; \"of course this is to be your night. What does it signify what I wear?\" \n \n \"Oh, but it does;—just the same as for me. I don\u0027t see why you are not to be just as nice as myself.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s not true, my dear.\" \n \n \"Why not true? There is quite as much depends on your good fortune as on mine. And then you are so much the cleverer of the two.\" \n \n Then when the day for the ball drew near, there came to be some more serious conversation between them. \n \n \"Ada, love, you mean to enjoy yourself, don\u0027t you?\" \n \n \"If I can I will. When I go to these things I never know whether they will lead to enjoyment or the reverse. Some little thing happens so often, and everything seems to go wrong.\" \n \n \"They shouldn\u0027t go wrong with you, my pet.\" \n \n \"Why not with me as well as with others?\" \n \n \"Because you are so beautiful to look at. You are made to be queen of a ball-room; not a London ball-room, where everything, I take it, is flash and faded, painted and stale, and worn out; but down here in the country, where there is some life among us, and where a girl may be supposed to be excited over her dancing. It is in such rooms as this that hearts are won and lost; a bid made for diamonds is all that is done in London.\" \n \n \"I never was at a London ball,\" said Ada. \n \n \"Nor I either; but one reads of them. I can fancy a man really caring for a girl down in Galway. Can you fancy a man caring for a girl?\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Ada. \n \n \"For yourself, now?\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t think anybody will ever care much for me.\" \n \n \"Oh, Ada, what a fib. It is all very pretty, your mock modestly, but it is so untrue. A man not love you! Why, I can fancy a man thinking that the gods could not allow him a greater grace than the privilege of taking you in his arms.\" \n \n \"Isn\u0027t anyone to take you in his arms, then?\" \n \n \"No, no one. I am not a thing to be looked at in that light. I mean eventually to take to women\u0027s rights, and to make myself generally odious. Only I have promised to stick to papa, and I have got to do that first. You;—who will you stick to?\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Ada. \n \n \"If I were to suggest Captain Yorke Clayton? If I were to suppose that he is the man who is to have the privilege?\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t, Edith.\" \n \n \"He is my hero, and you are my pet, and I want to bring you two together. I want to have my share in the hero; and still to keep a share in my pet. Is not that rational?\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know that there is anything rational in it all,\" said Ada. But still she went to bed well pleased that night. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2744/75562.html","bookId":1377,"book":{"id":1377,"title":"The Landleaguers","description":"简介： In the year 1850 the two estates of Ballintubber and Morony were sold to Mr. Philip Jones, under the Estates Court, which had then been established.
