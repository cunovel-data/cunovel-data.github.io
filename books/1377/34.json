{"id":11439,"no":34,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIV. LORD CASTLEWELL\u0027S LOVE-MAKING.","content":"It was explained in the last chapter that Frank Jones was not in a happy condition because of the success of the lady whom he loved. Rachel, as Christmas drew nigh, was more and more talked about in London, and became more and more the darling of all musical people. She had been twelve months now on the London boards, and had fully justified the opinion expressed of her by Messrs. Moss and Le Gros. There were those who declared that she sang as no woman of her age had ever sung before. And there had got abroad about her certain stories, which were true enough in the main, but which were all the more curious because of their truth; and yet they were not true altogether. It was known that she was a daughter of a Landleaguing Member of Parliament, and that she had been engaged to marry the son of a boycotted landlord. Mr. Jones\u0027 sorrows, and the death of his poor son, and the murder of the sinner who was to have been the witness at the trial of his brother, were all known and commented on in the London press; and so also was the peculiar vigour of Mr. O\u0027Mahony\u0027s politics. Nothing, it was said, could be severed more entirely than were Mr. Jones and Mr. O\u0027Mahony. The enmity was so deep that all ideas of marriage were out of the question. It was, no doubt, true that the gentleman was penniless and the lady rolling in wealth; but this was a matter so grievous that so poor a thing as money could not be allowed to prevail. And then Mr. Moss was talked about as a dragon of iniquity,—which, indeed, was true enough,—and was represented as having caused contracts to be executed which would bind poor Rachel to himself, both as to voice and beauty. But Lord Castlewell had seen her, and had heard her; and Mr. Moss, with all his abominations, was sent down to the bottom of the nethermost pit. The fortune of \"The Embankment\" was made by the number of visitors who were sent there to see and to hear this wicked fiend; but it all redounded to the honour and glory of Rachel. But Rachel was to be seen a fêted guest at all semi-musical houses. Whispers about town were heard that that musical swell, Lord Castlewell, had been caught at last. And in the midst of all this, Mr. O\u0027Mahony came in for his share of popularity. There was something so peculiar in the connection which bound a violent Landleaguing Member of Parliament with the prima donna of the day. They were father and daughter, but they looked more like husband and wife, and it always seemed that Rachel had her own way. Mr. O\u0027Mahony had quite achieved a character for himself before the time had come in which he was enabled to open his mouth in the House of Commons. And some people went so far as to declare that he was about to be the new leader of the party. It certainly was true that about this time Lord Castlewell did make an offer to Rachel O\u0027Mahony. \"That I should have come to this!\" she said to the lord when the lord had expressed his wishes. \"You deserve it all,\" said the gallant lord. \"I think I do. But that you should have seen it,—that you should have come to understand that if I would be your wife I would sing every note out of my body,—to do you good if it were possible. How have you been enlightened so far as to see that this is the way in which you may best make yourself happy?\" Lord Castlewell did not quite like this; but he knew that his wished-for bride was an unintelligible little person, to whom much must be yielded as to her own way. He had not given way to this idea before he had seen how well she had taken her place among the people with whom he lived. He was forty years old, and it was time that he should marry. His father was a very proud personage, to whom he never spoke much. He, however, would be of opinion that any bride whom his son might choose would be, by the very fact, raised to the top of the peerage. His mother was a religious woman, to whom any matrimony for her son would be an achievement. Now, of the proposed bride he had learned all manner of good things. She had come out of Mr. Moss\u0027s furnace absolutely unscorched; so much unscorched as to scorn the idea of having been touched by the flames. She was thankful to Lord Castlewell for what he had done, and expressed her thanks in a manner that was not grateful to him. She was not in the least put about or confused, or indeed surprised, because the heir of a marquis had made an offer to her—a singing girl; but she let him understand that she quite thought that she had done a good thing. \"It would be so much better for him than going on as he has gone,\" she said to her father. And Lord Castlewell knew very well what were her sentiments. It cannot be said that he repented of his offer. Indeed he pressed her for an answer more than once or twice. But her conduct to him was certainly very aggravating. This matter of her marriage with an earl was an affair of great moment. Indeed all London was alive with the subject. But she had not time to give him an answer because it was necessary that she should study a part for the theatre. This was hard upon an earl, and was made no better by the fact that the earl was forty. \"No, my lord earl,\" she said laughing, \"the time for that has not come yet. You must give me a few days to think of it.\" This she said when he expressed a not unnatural desire to give her a kiss. But though she apparently made light of the matter to him, and astonished even her father by her treatment of him, yet she thought of it with a very anxious mind. She was quite alive to the glories of the position offered to her, and was not at all alive to its inconveniences. People would assert that she had caught the lover who had intended her for other purposes. \"That was of course out of the question,\" she said to herself. And she felt sure that she could make as good a countess as the best of them. With her father a Member of Parliament, and her husband an earl, she would have done very well with herself. She would have escaped from that brute Moss, and would have been subjected to less that was disagreeable in the encounter than might have been expected. She must lose the public singing which was attractive to her, and must become the wife of an old man. It was thus in truth that she looked at the noble lord. \"There would be an end,\" she said, \"and for ever, of \u0027Love\u0027s young dream.\u0027\" The dream had been very pleasant to her. She had thoroughly liked her Frank. He was handsome, fresh, full of passion, and a little violent when his temper lay in that direction. But he had been generous, and she was sure of him that he had loved her thoroughly. After all, was not \"Love\u0027s young dream\" the best? An answer was at any rate due to Lord Castlewell. But she made up her mind that before she could give the answer, she would write to Frank himself. \"My lord,\" she said very gravely to her suitor, \"it has become my lot in life to be engaged to marry the son of that Mr. Jones of whom you have heard in the west of Ireland.\" \"I am aware of it,\" said Lord Castlewell gravely. \"It has been necessary that I should tell you myself. Now, I cannot say whether, in all honour, that engagement has been dissolved.\" \"I thought there was no doubt about it,\" said the lord. \"It is as I tell you. I must write to Mr. Jones. Hearts cannot be wrenched asunder without some effort in the wrenching. For the great honour you have done me I am greatly thankful.\" \"Let all that pass,\" said the lord. \"Not so. It has to be spoken of. As I stand at present I have been repudiated by Mr. Jones.\" \"Do you mean to ask him to take you back again?\" \"I do not know how the letter will be worded, because it has not been yet written. My object is to tell him of the honour which Lord Castlewell proposes to me. And I have not thought it quite honest to your lordship to do this without acquainting you.\" Then that interview was over, and Lord Castlewell went away no doubt disgusted. He had not intended to be treated in this way by a singing girl, when he proposed to make her his countess. But with the disgust there was a strengthened feeling of admiration for her conduct. She looked much more like the countess than the singing girl when she spoke to him. And there certainly never came a time in which he could tell her to go back and sing and marry Mr. Moss. Therefore the few days necessary for an answer went by, and then she gave him her reply. \"My lord,\" she said, \"if you wish it still, it shall be so.\" The time for \"Love\u0027s young dream\" had not gone by for Lord Castlewell. \"I do wish it still,\" he said in a tone of renewed joy. \"Then you shall have all that you wish.\" Thereupon she put her little hands on his arm, and leant her face against his breast. Then there was a long embrace, but after the embrace she had a little speech to make. \"You ought to know, Lord Castlewell, how much I think of you and your high position. A man, they say, trusts much of his honour into the hands of his wife. Whatever you trust to me shall be guarded as my very soul. You shall be to me the one man whom I am bound to worship. I will worship you with all my heart, with all my body, with all my soul, and with all my strength. Your wishes shall be my wishes. I only hope that an odd stray wish of mine may occasionally be yours.\" Then she smiled so sweetly that as she looked up into his face he was more enamoured of her than ever. But now we must go back for a moment, and read the correspondence which took place between Rachel O\u0027Mahony and Frank Jones. Rachel\u0027s letter ran as follows: My dear Frank, I am afraid I must trouble you once again with my affairs; though, indeed, after what last took place between us it ought not to be necessary. Lord Castlewell has proposed to make me his wife; and, to tell you the truth, looking forward into the world, I do not wish to throw over all its pleasures because your honour, whom I have loved, does not wish to accept the wages of a singing girl. But the place is open to you still,—the wages, and the singing girl, and all. Write me a line, and say how it is to be. Yours as you would have me to be, Rachel O\u0027Mahony. This letter Frank Jones showed to no one. Had he allowed it to be seen by his sister Edith, she would probably have told him that no man ever received a sweeter love-letter from the girl whom he loved. \"The place is open to you still,—the wages, the singing girl, and all.\" The girl had made nothing of this new and noble lover, except to assure his rival that he, the rival, should be postponed to him, the lover, if he, the lover, would write but one word to say that it should be so. But Frank was bad at reading such words. He got it into his head that the girl had merely written to ask the permission of her former suitor to marry this new lordly lover, and, though he did love the girl, with a passion which the girl could never feel for the lord, he wrote back and refused the offer. My dear Rachel, It is, I suppose, best as it is. We are sinking lower and lower daily. My father is beginning to feel that we shall never see another rent day at Castle Morony. It is not fitting that I should think of joining my fallen fortunes to yours, which are soaring so high. And poor Florian is gone. We are at the present moment still struck to the ground because of Florian. As for you, and the lord who admires you, you have my permission to become his wife. I have long heard that he is your declared admirer. You have before you a glorious future, and I shall always hear with satisfaction of your career. Yours, with many memories of the past, Francis Jones. It was not a letter which would have put such a girl as Rachel O\u0027Mahony into good heart unless she had in truth wished to get his agreement to her lordly marriage. \"This twice I have thrown myself at his head and he has rejected me.\" Then she abided Lord Castlewell\u0027s coming, and the scene between them took place as above described. The marriage was at once declared as a settled thing. \"Now, my dear, you must name the day,\" said Lord Castlewell, as full of joy as though he were going to marry a duke\u0027s daughter. \"I have got to finish my engagement,\" said Rachel; \"I am bound down to the end of May. When June comes you shan\u0027t find a girl who will be in a greater hurry. Do you think that I do not wish to become a countess?\" He told her that he would contrive to get her engagement broken. \"Covent Garden is not going to quarrel with me about my wife, I\u0027m sure,\" he said. \"Ah! but my own one,\" said Rachel, \"we will do it all selon les règles. I am in a hurry, but we won\u0027t let the world know it. I, the future Countess of Castlewell; I, the future Marchioness of Beaulieu, will keep my terms and my allotted times like any candle-snuffer. What do you think Moss will say?\" \"What can it signify what Mr. Moss may say?\" \"Ah! but my own man, it does signify. Mr. Moss shall know that through it all I have done my duty. Madame Socani will tell lies, but she shall feel in her heart that she has once in her life come across a woman who, when she has signed a bit of paper, intends to remain true to the paper signed. And, my lord, there is still ￡100 due to you from my father.\" \"Gammon!\" said the lord. \"I could pay it by a cheque on the bank, to be sure, but let us go on to the end of May. I want to see how all the young women will behave when they hear of it.\" And so some early day in June was fixed for the wedding. Among others who heard of it were, of course, Mr. Moss and Madame Socani. They heard of it, but of course did not believe it. It was too bright to be believed. When Madame Socani was assured that Rachel had taken the money,—she and her father between them,—she declared, with great apparent satisfaction, that Rachel must be given up as lost. \"As to that wicked old man, her father—\" \"He\u0027s not so very old,\" said Moss. \"She\u0027s no chicken, and he\u0027s old enough to be her father. That is, if he is her father. I have known that girl on the stage any day these ten years.\" \"No, you\u0027ve not; not yet five. I don\u0027t quite know how it is.\" And Mr. Moss endeavoured to think of it all in such a manner as to make it yet possible that he might marry her. What might not they two do together in the musical world? \"You don\u0027t mean to say you\u0027d take her yet?\" said Madame Socani, with scorn. \"When I take her you\u0027ll be glad enough to join us; that is, if we will have you.\" Then Madame Socani ground her teeth together, and turned up her nose with redoubled scorn. But it was soon borne in upon Mr. Moss that the marriage was to be a marriage, and he was in truth very angry. He had been able to endure M. Le Gros\u0027 success in carrying away Miss O\u0027Mahony from \"The Embankment.\" Miss O\u0027Mahony might come back again under that or any other name. He—and she—had a musical future before them which might still be made to run in accordance with his wishes. Then he had learned with sincere sorrow that she was throwing herself into the lord\u0027s hands, borrowing money of him. But there might be a way out of this which would still allow him to carry out his project. But now he heard that a real marriage was intended, and he was very angry. Not even Madame Socani was more capable of spite than Mr. Moss, though he was better able to hide his rage. Even now, when Christmas-time had come, he would hardly believe the truth, and when the marriage was not instantly carried out, new hopes came to him—that Lord Castlewell would not at last make himself such a fool. He inquired here and there in the musical world and the theatrical world, and could not arrive at what he believed to be positive truth. Then Christmas passed by, and Miss O\u0027Mahony recommenced her singing at Covent Garden. Three times a week the house was filled, and at last a fourth night was added, for which the salary paid to Rachel was very much increased. \"I don\u0027t see that the salary matters very much,\" said Lord Castlewell, when the matter was discussed. \"Oh, but, my lord, it does matter!\" She always called him my lord now, with a little emphasis laid on the \"my.\" \"They have made father a Member of Parliament, but he does not earn anything. What I can earn up to the last fatal day he shall have, if you will let me give it to him.\" They were very bright days for Rachel, because she had all the triumph of success,—success gained by her own efforts. \"I can never do as much as this when I am your countess,\" she said to her future lord. \"I shall dwell in marble halls, as people say, but I shall never cram a house so full as to be able to see, when I look up from the stage, that there is not a place for another man\u0027s head; and when my throat gave way the other day I could read all the disappointment in the public papers. I shall become your wife, my lord.\" \"I hope so.\" \"And if you will love me I shall be very happy for long, long years.\" \"I will love you.\" \"But there will be no passion of ecstasy such as this. Father says that Home Rule won\u0027t be passed because the people will be thinking of my singing. Of course it is all vanity, but there is an enjoyment in it.\" But all this was wormwood to Mr. Moss. He had put out his hand so as to clutch this girl now two years since, understanding all her singing qualities, and then in truth loving her. She had taken a positive hatred to him, and had rejected him at every turn of her life. But he had not at all regarded that. He had managed to connect her with his theatre, and had perceived that her voice had become more and more sweet in its tones, and more and more rich in its melody. He had still hoped that he would make her his wife. Madame Socani\u0027s abominable proposal had come from an assurance on her part that he could have all that he wished for without paying so dear for it. There had doubtless been some whispering between them over the matter, but the order for the proposal had not come from him. Madame Socani had judged of Rachel as she might have judged of herself. But all that had come to absolute failure. He felt now that he should be paying by no means too dear by marrying the girl. It would be a great triumph to marry her; but he was told that this absurd earl wished to triumph in the same manner. He set afloat all manner of reports, which, in truth, wounded Lord Castlewell sorely. Lord Castlewell had given her money, and had then failed in his object. So said Mr. Moss. Lord Castlewell had promised marriage, never intending it. Lord Castlewell had postponed the marriage because as the moment drew nearer he would not sacrifice himself. If the lady had a friend, it would be the friend\u0027s duty to cudgel the lord, so villainous had been the noble lord\u0027s conduct. But yet, in truth, who could have expected that the noble lord would have married the singing girl? Was not his character known? Did anybody in his senses expect that the noble lord would marry Miss Rachel O\u0027Mahony? \"If I have a friend, is my friend to cudgel you, my lord?\" she said, clinging on to his arm in her usual manner. \"My friend is papa, who thinks that you are a very decent fellow, considering your misfortune in being a lord at all. I know where all these words come from;—it is Mahomet M. Moss. There is nothing for it but to live them down with absolute silence.\" \"Nothing,\" he replied. \"They are a nuisance, but we can do nothing.\" But Lord Castlewell did in truth feel what was said about him. Was he not going to pay too dearly for his whistle? No doubt Rachel was all that she ought to be. She was honest, industrious, and high-spirited; and, according to his thinking, she sang more divinely than any woman of her time. And he so thought of her that he knew that she must be his countess or be nothing at all to him. To think of her in any other light would be an abomination to him. But yet, was it worth his while to make her Marchioness of Beaulieu? He could only get rid of his present engagement by some absolute change in his mode of life. For instance, he must shut himself up in a castle and devote himself entirely to a religious life. He must explain to her that circumstances would not admit his marrying, and must offer to pay her any sum of money that she or her father might think fit to name. If he wished to escape, this must be his way; but as he looked at her when she came off the stage, where he always attended her, he assured himself that he did not wish to escape.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2744/75572.html","bookId":1377,"book":{"id":1377,"title":"The Landleaguers","description":"简介： In the year 1850 the two estates of Ballintubber and Morony were sold to Mr. Philip Jones, under the Estates Court, which had then been established.
