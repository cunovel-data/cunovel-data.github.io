{"id":11425,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XX. BOYCOTTING.","content":"Frank Jones went back to County Galway, having caught a last glimpse of his lady-love. But his lady-love could not very well make herself known to him from the stage as she was occupied at the moment with Trullo. And as he had left the theatre before her message had been brought round, he did so with a bitter conviction that everything between them was over. He felt very angry with her,—no doubt unreasonably. The lady was about to make a pocketful of money; and had offered to share it with him. He refused to take any part of it, and declined altogether to incur any of the responsibilities of marriage for the present. His father\u0027s circumstances too were of such a nature as to make him almost hopeless for the future. What would he have had her do? Nevertheless he was very angry with her. As he made his way westward through Ireland he heard more and more of the troubles of the country. He had not in fact been gone much more than a week, but during that week sad things had happened. Boycotting had commenced, and had already become very prevalent. To boycott a man, or a house, or a firm, or a class of men, or a trade, or a flock of sheep, or a drove of oxen, or unfortunately a county hunt, had become an exact science, and was exactly obeyed. It must be acknowledged that throughout the south and west of Ireland the quickness and perfection with which this science was understood and practised was very much to the credit of the intelligence of the people. We can understand that boycotting should be studied in Yorkshire, and practised,—after an experience of many years. Laying on one side for the moment all ideas as to the honesty and expediency of the measure, we think that Yorkshire might in half a century learn how to boycott its neighbours. A Yorkshire man might boycott a Lancashire man, or Lincoln might boycott Nottingham. It would require much teaching;—many books would have to be written, and an infinite amount of heavy slow imperfect practice would follow. But County Mayo and County Galway rose to the requirements of the art almost in a night! Gradually we Englishmen learned to know in a dull glimmering way what they were about; but at the first whisper of the word all Ireland knew how to ruin itself. This was done readily by people of the poorer class,—without any gifts of education, and certainly the immoderate practice of the science displays great national intelligence. As Frank Jones passed through Dublin he learned that Morony Castle had been boycotted; and he was enough of an Irishman to know immediately what was meant. And he heard, too, while in the train that the kennels at Ahaseragh had been boycotted. He knew that with the kennels would be included Black Daly, and with Morony Castle his unfortunate father. According to the laws on which the practice was carried on nothing was to be bought from the land of Morony Castle, and nothing sold to the owners of it. No service was to be done for the inhabitants, as far as the laws of boycotting might be made to prevail. He learned from a newspaper he bought in Dublin that the farm servants had all left the place, and that the maids had been given to understand that they would encounter the wrath of the new lords in the land if they made a bed for any Jones to lie upon. As he went on upon his journey his imagination went to work to picture to himself the state of his father\u0027s life under these circumstances. But his imagination was soon outstripped by the information which reached him from fellow-travellers. \"Did ye hear what happened to old Phil Jones down at Morony?\" said a passenger, who got in at Moate, to another who had joined them at Athlone. \"Divil a hear thin.\" \"Old Phil wanted to get across from Ballyglunin to his own place. He had been down to Athenry. There was that chap who is always there with a car. Divil a foot would he stir for Phil. Phil has had some row with the boys there about his meadows, and he\u0027s trying to prosecute. More fool he. A quiet, aisy-going fellow he used to be. But it seems he has been stirred now. He has got some man in Galway jail, and all the country is agin him. Anyways he had to foot it from Ballyglunin to Headford, and then to send home to Morony for his own car.\" In this way did Frank learn that his father had in truth incurred boycotting severity. He knew well the old man who had attended the Ballyglunin station with almost a hopeless desire of getting a fare, and was sure that nothing short of an imperious edict from the great Landleaguing authorities in the district, would have driven him to the necessity of repudiating a passenger. But when he had reached the further station of Ballinasloe he learned sadder tidings in regard to his friend Tom Daly. Tom Daly had put no man in prison, and yet the kennels at Ahaseragh had been burned to the ground. This had occurred only on the preceding day; and he got the account of what had happened from a hunting man he knew well. \"The hounds were out you know last Saturday week as a finish, and poor Tom did hope that we might get through without any further trouble. We met at Ballinamona, and we drew Blake\u0027s coverts without a word. We killed our fox too and then went away to Pulhaddin gorse. I\u0027ll be blest if all the county weren\u0027t there. I never saw the boys swarm about a place so thick. Pulhaddin is the best gorse in the county. Of course it was no use drawing it; but as we were going away on the road to Loughrea the crowd was so thick that there was no riding among them. Ever so many horsemen got into the fields to be away from the crowd. But Tom wouldn\u0027t allow Barney and the hounds to be driven from the road. I never saw a man look so angry in my life. You could see the passion that was on him. He never spoke a word, nor raised a hand, nor touched his horse with his spur; but he got blacker and blacker, and would go on whether the crowd moved asunder or not. And he told Barney to follow him with the hounds, which Barney did, looking back ever and anon at the poor brutes, and giving his instructions to the whips to see well after that they did not wander. They threatened Barney scores of times with their sticks, but he came on, funking awfully, but still doing whatever Tom told him. I was riding just behind him among the hounds so that I could see all that took place. At last a ruffian with his shillelagh struck Barney over the thigh. I had not time to get to him; indeed I doubt whether I should have done so, but Tom,—; by George, he saw out of the back of his head. He turned round, and, without touching his horse with spur or whip, rode right at the ruffian. If they had struck himself, I think he would have borne it more easily.\" \"How did it end?\" \"They said that the blackguard was hurt, but I saw him escape and get away over the fence. Then they all set upon Tom, but by G—— it was glorious to see the way in which he held his own. Out came that cross of his, four foot and a half long, with a thong as heavy as a flail. He soon had the road clear around him, and the big black horse you remember, stood as steady as a statue till he was bidden to move on. Then when he had the hounds, and Barney Smith and the whips to himself,—and I was there—we all rode off at a fast trot to Loughrea.\" \"And then?\" \"We could do nothing but go home; the whole county seemed to be in a ferment. At Loughrea we went away in our own directions, and poor Tom with Barney Smith rode home to Ahaseragh. But not a word did he speak to anyone, even to Barney; nor did Barney dare to speak a word to him. He trotted all the way to Ahaseragh in moody silence, thinking of the terrible ill that had been done him. I have known Tom for twenty years, and I think that if he loves any man he loves me. But he parted from me that day without a word.\" \"And then the kennels were set on fire?\" \"Before I left Loughrea I heard the report, spread about everywhere, that Tom Daly had recklessly ridden down three or four more poor countrymen on the road. I knew then that some mischief would be in hand. It was altogether untrue that he had hurt anyone. And he was bound to interfere on behalf of his own servant. But when I heard this morning that a score of men had been there in the night and had burned the kennels to the ground, I was not surprised.\" Such was the story that Frank Jones heard as to Tom Daly before he got home. On reaching Ballyglunin he looked out for the carman, but he was not there. Perhaps the interference with his task had banished him. Frank went on to Tuam, which increased slightly the distance by road to Morony. But at Tuam he found that Morony had in truth been boycotted. He could not get a car for love or money. There were many cars there, and the men would not explain to him their reasons for declining to take him home; but they all refused. \"We can\u0027t do it, Mr. Frank,\" said one man; and that was the nearest approach to an explanation that was forthcoming. He walked into town and called at various houses; but it was to no purpose. It was with difficulty that he found himself allowed to leave his baggage at a grocer\u0027s shop, so strict was the boycotting exacted. And then he too had to walk home through Headford to Morony Castle. When he reached the house he first encountered Peter, the butler. \"Faix thin, Mr. Frank,\" said Peter, \"throubles niver comed in \u0027arnest till now. Why didn\u0027t they allow Mr. Flory just to hould his pace and say nothing about it to no one?\" \"Why has all this been done?\" demanded Frank. \"It\u0027s that born divil, Pat Carroll,\" whispered Peter. \"I wouldn\u0027t be saying it so that any of the boys or girls should hear me,—not for my throat\u0027s sake. I am the only one of \u0027em,\" he added, whispering still lower than before, \"that\u0027s doing a ha\u0027porth for the masther. There are the two young ladies a-working their very fingers off down to the knuckles. As for me, I\u0027ve got it all on my shoulders.\" No doubt Peter was true to his master in adversity, but he did not allow the multiplicity of his occupations to interfere with his eloquence. Then Frank went in and found his father seated alone in his magistrate\u0027s room. \"This is bad, father,\" said Frank, taking him by the hand. \"Bad! yes, you may call it bad. I am ruined, I suppose. There are twenty heifers ready for market next week, and I am told that not a butcher in County Galway will look at one of them.\" \"Then you must send them on to Westmeath; I suppose the Mullingar butchers won\u0027t boycott you?\" \"It\u0027s just what they will do.\" \"Then send them on to Dublin.\" \"Who\u0027s to take them to Dublin?\" said the father, in his distress. \"I will if there be no one else. We are not going to be knocked out of time for want of two or three pairs of hands.\" \"There are two policemen here to watch the herd at night. They\u0027d cut the tails off them otherwise as they did over at Ballinrobe last autumn. To whom am I to consign \u0027em in Dublin? While I am making new arrangements of that kind their time will have gone by. There are five cows should be milked morning and night. Who is to milk them?\" \"Who is milking them?\" \"Your sisters are doing it, with the aid of an old woman who has come from Galway. She says she has not long to live, and with the help of half-a-crown a day cares nothing for the Landleaguers. I wish someone would pay me half-a-crown a day, and perhaps I should not care.\" Then Frank passed on through the house to find his sisters, or Flory as it might be. He had said not a word to his father in regard to Florian, fearing to touch upon a subject which, as he well knew, must be very sore. Had Florian told the truth when the deed was done, Pat Carroll would have been tried at once, and, whether convicted or acquitted, the matter would have been over long ago. In those days Pat Carroll had not become a national or even a county hero. But now he was able to secure the boycotting of his enemy even as far distant as Ballyglunin or Tuam. In the kitchen he found Ada and Edith, who had no comfort in these perilous days except when they could do everything together. At the present moment they were roasting a leg of mutton and boiling potatoes, which Frank knew were intended especially for his own eating. \"Well, my girls, you are busy here,\" he said. \"Oh, yes, busy!\" said Ada, who had put up her face to be kissed so as not to soil her brother\u0027s coat by touching it with her hands. \"How is Rachel?\" \"Rachel is pretty well, I believe. We will not talk of Rachel just at present.\" \"Is anything wrong,\" asked Edith. \"We will not talk about her, not now. What is all this that has happened here?\" \"We are just boycotted,\" said Ada; \"that\u0027s all.\" \"And you think that it\u0027s the best joke in the world?\" \"Think it a joke!\" said Edith. \"Why we have to be up every morning at five o\u0027clock,\" said Ada; \"and at six we are out with the cows.\" \"It is no joke,\" said Edith, very seriously. \"Papa is broken-hearted about it. Your coming will be of the greatest comfort to us, if only because of the pair of hands you bring. And poor Flory!\" \"How has it gone with Flory?\" he asked. Then Edith told the tale as it had to be told of Florian, and of what had happened because of the evidence he had given. He had come forward under the hands of Captain Yorke Clayton and repeated his whole story, giving it in testimony before the magistrates. He declared it all exactly as he had done before in the presence of his father and his sister and Captain Clayton. And he had sworn to it, and had had his deposition read to him. He was sharp enough, and understood well what he was doing. The other two men were brought up to support him,—the old man Terry and Con Heffernan. They of course had not been present at the examination of Flory, and were asked,—first one and then the other,—what they knew of the transactions of the afternoon on which the waters had been let in on the meadows of Ballintubber. They knew nothing at all, they said. They \"disremembered\" whether they had been there on the occasion, \"at all, at all.\" Yes; they knew that the waters had been in upon the meadows, and they believed that they were in again still. They didn\u0027t think that the meadows were of much good for this year. They didn\u0027t know who had done it, \"at all, at all.\" People did be saying that Mr. Florian had done it himself, so as to spite his father because he had turned Catholic. They couldn\u0027t say whether Mr. Florian could do it alone or not. They thought Mr. Florian and Peter, the butler, and perhaps one other, might do it amongst them. They thought that Yorke Clayton might perhaps have been the man to help him. They didn\u0027t know that Yorke Clayton hadn\u0027t been in the county at that time. They wished with all their hearts that he wasn\u0027t there now, because he was the biggest blackguard they had ever heard tell of. Such was the story which was now told to Frank of the examination which took place in consequence of Florian\u0027s confession. The results were that Pat Carroll was in Galway jail, committed to take his trial at the next assizes in August for the offence which he had committed; and that Florian had been bound over to give evidence. \"What does Florian do with himself?\" his brother asked. \"I am afraid he is frightened,\" said Ada. \"Of course he is frightened,\" said her sister. \"How should he not be frightened? These men have been telling him for the last six months that they would surely murder him if he turned round and gave evidence against them. Oh, Frank, I fear that I have been wrong in persuading him to tell the truth.\" \"Not though his life were sacrificed to-morrow. To have kept the counsels of such a ruffian as that against his own father would have been a disgrace to him for ever. Does not my father think of sending him to England?\" \"He says that he has not the money,\" said Edith. \"Is it so bad as that with him?\" \"I am afraid it is very bad,—bad at any rate, for the time coming. He has not had a shilling of rent for this spring, and he has to pay the money to Mrs. Pulteney and the others. Poor papa is sorely vexed, and we do not like to press him. He suggested himself that he would send Florian over to Mr. Blake\u0027s; but we think that Carnlough is not far enough, and that it would be unfair to impose such a trouble on another man.\" \"Could he not send him to Mrs. Pulteney?\" Now Mrs. Pulteney was a sister of Mr. Jones. \"He does not like to ask her,\" said Edith. \"He thinks that Mrs. Pulteney has not shown herself very kind of late. We are waiting till you speak to him about it.\" \"But what does Florian do with himself?\" he asked. \"You will see. He does little or nothing, but roams about the house and talks to Peter. He did not even go to mass last Sunday. He says that the whole congregation would accuse him of being a liar.\" \"Does he not know that he has done his duty by the lie he has told?\" \"But to go alone among these people!\" said Ada. \"And to hear their damnable taunts!\" said Edith. \"It is very hard upon him. I think it is papa\u0027s idea to keep him here till after the trial in August, and then, if possible, to send him to England. There would be the double journey else, and papa thinks that there would be no real danger till his evidence had been given.\" Then Frank went out of the house and walked round the demesne, so that he might think at his ease of all the troubles of his family.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2744/75558.html","bookId":1377,"book":{"id":1377,"title":"The Landleaguers","description":"简介： In the year 1850 the two estates of Ballintubber and Morony were sold to Mr. Philip Jones, under the Estates Court, which had then been established.
