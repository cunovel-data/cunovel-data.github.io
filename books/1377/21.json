{"id":11426,"no":21,"title":"CHAPTER XXI. LAX, THE MURDERER.","content":"Frank Jones found his brother Florian alone in the butler\u0027s pantry, and was told that Peter was engaged in feeding the horses and cleaning out the stables. \"He\u0027s mostly engaged in that kind of work now,\" said Florian. \"Who lays the tablecloth?\" asked Frank. \"I do; or Edith; sometimes we don\u0027t have any tablecloth, or any clean knives and forks. Perhaps they\u0027ll have one to-day because you have come.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t give them increased trouble,\" said Frank. \"Papa told them to put their best foot forward because you are here. I don\u0027t think he minds at all about himself. I think papa is very unhappy.\" \"Of course he\u0027s unhappy, because they have boycotted him. How should he not be unhappy.\" \"It\u0027s worse than that,\" whispered Florian. \"What can be worse?\" \"If you\u0027ll come with me I\u0027ll tell you. I don\u0027t want to say it here, because the girls will hear me;—and that old Peter will know everything that\u0027s said.\" \"Come out into the grounds, and take a turn before dinner.\" At this Florian shook his head. \"Why not, Flory.\" \"There are fellows about,\" said Flory. \"What fellows?\" \"The very fellows that said they\u0027d kill me. Do you know that fellow Lax? He\u0027s the worst of them.\" \"But he doesn\u0027t live here.\" \"All the same, I saw him yesterday.\" \"You were out then, yesterday?\" \"Not to say out,\" said Flory. \"I was in the orchard just behind the stables; and I could see across into the ten-acre piece. There, at the further side of the field, I saw a fellow, who I am sure was Lax. Nobody walks like him, he\u0027s got that quick, suspicious way of going. It was just nearly dark; it was well-nigh seven, and I had been with Peter in the stables, helping to make up the horses, and I am sure it was Lax.\" \"He won\u0027t come near you and me on the broad walk,\" said Frank. \"Won\u0027t he? You don\u0027t know him. There are half-a-dozen places there where he could hit us from behind the wall. Come up into your room, and I\u0027ll tell you what it is that makes papa unhappy.\" Then Frank led the way upstairs to his bedroom, and Florian followed him. When inside he shut the door, and seated himself on the bed close to his brother. \"Now I\u0027ll tell you,\" said he. \"What is it ails him?\" \"He\u0027s frightened,\" said Florian, \"because he doesn\u0027t wish me to be—murdered.\" \"My poor boy! Who could wish it?\" Here Florian shook his head. \"Of course he doesn\u0027t wish it.\" \"He made me tell about the meadow gates.\" \"You had to tell that, Flory.\" \"But it will bring them to murder me. If you had heard them make me promise and had seen their looks! Papa never thought about that till the man had come and worked it all out of me.\" \"What man?\" \"The head of the policemen, Yorke Clayton. Papa was so fierce upon me then, that he made me do it.\" \"You had to do it,\" said Frank. \"Let things go as they might, you had to do it. You would not have it said of you that you had joined these ruffians against your father.\" \"I had sworn to Father Brosnan not to tell. But you care nothing for a priest, of course.\" \"Nothing in the least.\" \"Nor does father. But when I had told it all at his bidding, and had gone before the magistrates, and they had written it down, and that man Clayton had read it all and I had signed it, and papa had seen the look which Pat Carroll had turned upon me, then he became frightened. I knew that that man Lax was in the room at the moment. I did not see him, but I felt that he was there. Now I don\u0027t go out at all, except just into the orchard and front garden. I won\u0027t go even there, as I saw Lax about the place yesterday. I know that they mean to murder me.\" \"There will be no danger,\" said Frank, \"unless Carroll be convicted. In that case your father will have you sent to a school in England.\" \"Papa hasn\u0027t got the money; I heard him tell Edith so. And they wouldn\u0027t know how to carry me to the station at Ballyglunin. Those boys from Ballintubber would shoot at me on the road. It\u0027s that that makes papa so unhappy.\" Then they all went to dinner with a cloth laid fair on the table, for Frank, who was as it were a stranger. And there were many inquiries made after Rachel and her theatrical performances. Tidings as to her success had already reached Morony, and wonderful accounts of the pecuniary results. They had seen stories in the newspapers of the close friendship which existed between her and Mr. Moss, and hints had been given for a closer tie. \"I don\u0027t think it is likely,\" said Frank. \"But is anything the matter between you and Rachel?\" asked Edith. At that moment Peter was walking off with the leg of mutton, and Ada had run into the kitchen to fetch the rice pudding, which she had made to celebrate her brother\u0027s return. Edith winked at her brother to show that all questions as to the tender subject should be postponed for the moment. \"But is it true,\" said Ada, \"that Rachel is making a lot of money?\" \"That is true, certainly,\" said her brother. \"And that she sings gloriously?\" \"She always did sing gloriously,\" said Edith. \"I was sure that Rachel was intended for a success.\" \"I wonder what Captain Yorke Clayton would think about her,\" said Ada. \"He does understand music, and is very fond of young ladies who can sing. I heard him say that the Miss Ormesbys of Castlebar sang beautifully; and he sings himself, I know.\" \"Captain Clayton has something else to do at present than to watch the career of Miss O\u0027Mahony in London.\" This was said by their father, and was the first word he had spoken since they had sat down to dinner. It was felt to convey some reproach as to Rachel; but why a reproach was necessary was not explained. Peter was now out of the room, and the door was shut. \"Rachel and I have come to understand each other,\" said Frank. \"She is to have the spending of her money by herself, and I by myself am to enjoy life at Morony Castle.\" \"Is this her decision?\" asked Edith. It was on Frank\u0027s lips to declare that it was so; but he remembered himself, and swallowed down the falsehood unspoken. \"No,\" he said; \"it was not her decision. She offered to share it all with me.\" \"And you?\" said his father. \"Well, I didn\u0027t consent; and so we arranged that matters should be brought to an end between us.\" \"I knew what she would do,\" said Ada. \"Just what she ought,\" said Edith. \"Rachel is a fine girl. Nothing else was to be expected from her.\" \"And nothing else was possible with you,\" said their father. And so that conversation was brought to an end. On the next day Captain Clayton came up the lake from Galway, and was again engaged,—or pretended to be engaged,—in looking up for evidence in reference to the trial of Pat Carroll. Or it might be that he wanted to sun himself again in the bright eyes of Ada Jones. Again he brought Hunter, his double, with him, and boldly walked from Morony Castle into Headford, disregarding altogether the loaded guns of Pat Carroll\u0027s friends. In company with Frank he paid a visit to Tom Lafferty in his own house at Headford. But as he went there he insisted that Frank should carry a brace of pistols in his trousers\u0027 pockets. \"It\u0027s as well to do it, though you should never use them, or a great deal better that you should never use them. You don\u0027t want to get into all the muck of shooting a wretched, cowardly Landleaguer. If all the leaders had but one life among them there would be something worth going in for. But it is well that they should believe that you have got them. They are such cowards that if they know you\u0027ve got a pistol with you they will be afraid to get near enough to shoot you with a rifle. If you are in a room with fellows who see that you have your hand in your trousers\u0027 pocket, they will be in such a funk that you cow half-a-dozen of them. They look upon Hunter and me as though we were an armed company of policemen.\" So Frank carried the pistols. \"Well, Mr. Lafferty, how are things going with you to-day?\" \"\u0027Deed, then, Captain Clayton, it ain\u0027t much as I\u0027m able to say for myself. I\u0027ve the decentry that bad in my innards as I\u0027m all in the twitters.\" \"I\u0027m sorry for that, Mr. Lafferty. Are you well enough to tell me where did Mr. Lax go when he left you this morning?\" \"Who\u0027s Mr. Lax? I don\u0027t know no such person.\" \"Don\u0027t you, now? I thought that Mr. Lax was as well-known in Headford as the parish priest. Why, he\u0027s first cousin to your second cousin, Pat Carroll.\" \"\u0027Deed and he ain\u0027t then;—not that I ever heard tell of.\" \"I\u0027ve no doubt you know what relations he\u0027s got in these parts.\" \"I don\u0027t know nothin\u0027 about Terry Lax.\" \"Except that his name is Terry,\" said the Captain. \"I don\u0027t know nothin\u0027 about him, and I won\u0027t tell nothin\u0027 either.\" \"But he was here this morning, Mr. Lafferty?\" \"Not that I know of. I won\u0027t say nothin\u0027 more about him. It\u0027s as bad as lying you are with that d——d artful way of entrapping a fellow.\" Here Terry Carroll, Pat\u0027s brother, entered the cabin, and took off his hat, with an air of great courtesy. \"More power to you, Mr. Frank,\" he said, \"it\u0027s I that am glad to see you back from London. These are bad tidings they got up at the Castle. To think of Mr. Flory having such a story to tell as that.\" \"It\u0027s a true story at any rate,\" said Frank. \"Musha thin, not one o\u0027 us rightly knows. It\u0027s a long time ago, and if I were there at all, I disremember it. Maybe I was, though I wasn\u0027t doing anything on me own account. If Pat was to bid me, I\u0027d do that or any other mortal thing at Pat\u0027s bidding.\" \"If you are so good a brother as that, your complaisance is likely to bring you into trouble, Mr. Carroll. Come along, Jones, I\u0027ve got pretty nearly what I wanted from them.\" Then when they were in the street, he continued speaking to Frank. \"Your brother is right, though I wouldn\u0027t have believed it on any other testimony than one of themselves. That man Lax was here in the county yesterday. A more murderous fellow than he is not to be found in Connaught; and he\u0027s twice worse than any of the fellows about here. They will do it for revenge, or party purposes. He has a regular tariff for cutting throats. I should not wonder if he has come here for the sake of carrying out the threats which they made against your poor brother.\" \"Do you mean that he will be murdered?\" \"We must not let it come to that. We must have Lax up before the magistrate for having been present when they broke the flood gates.\" \"Have you got evidence of that?\" \"We can make the evidence serve its purpose for a time. If we can keep him locked up till after the trial we shall have done much. By heavens, there he is!\" As he spoke the flash of a shot glimmered across their eyes, and seemed to have been fired almost within a yard of them; but they were neither of them hit. Frank turned round and fired in the direction from whence the attack had come, but it was in vain. Clayton did bring his revolver from out his pocket, but held his fire. They were walking in a lane just out of the town that would carry them by a field-path to Morony Castle, and Clayton had chosen the path in order that he might be away from the public road. It was still daylight though it was evening, and the aggressor might have been seen had he attempted to cross their path. The lane was, as it were, built up on both sides with cabins, which had become ruins, each one of which might serve as a hiding-place. Hunter was standing close to them before another word was spoken. \"Did you see him?\" demanded Clayton. \"Not a glimpse; but I heard him through there, where the dead leaves are lying.\" There were a lot of dead leaves strewed about, some of which were in sight, within an enclosure separated from them by a low ruined wall. On leaving this the Captain was over it in a moment, but he was over it in vain. \"For God\u0027s sake, sir, don\u0027t go after him in that way,\" said Hunter, who followed close upon his track. \"It\u0027s no more than to throw your life away.\" \"I\u0027d give the world to have one shot at him,\" said Clayton. \"I don\u0027t think I would miss him within ten paces.\" \"But he\u0027d have had you, Captain, within three, had he waited for you.\" \"He never would have waited. A man who fires at you from behind a wall never will wait. Where on earth has he taken himself?\" And Clayton, with the open pistol in his hand, began to search the neighbouring hovels. \"He\u0027s away out of that by this time,\" said Hunter. \"I heard the bullet pass by my ears,\" said Frank. \"No doubt you did, but a miss is as good as a mile any day. That a fellow like that who is used to shooting shouldn\u0027t do better is a disgrace to the craft. It\u0027s that fellow Lax, and as I\u0027m standing on the ground this moment I\u0027ll have his life before I\u0027ve done with him.\" Nothing further came from this incident till the three started on their walk back to Morony Castle. But they did not do this till they had thoroughly investigated the ruins. \"Do you know anything of the man?\" said Frank, \"as to his whereabouts? or where he comes from?\" Then Clayton gave some short account of the hero. He had first come across him in the neighbourhood of Foxford near Lough Conn, and had there run him very hard, as the Captain said, in reference to an agrarian murder. He knew, he said, that the man had received thirty shillings for killing an old man who had taken a farm from which a tenant had been evicted. But he had on that occasion been tried and acquitted. He had since that lived on the spoils acquired after the same fashion. He was supposed to have come originally from Kilkenny, and whether his real name was or was not Lax, Captain Clayton did not pretend to say. \"But he had a fair shot at me,\" said Captain Clayton, \"and it shall go hard with me but I shall have as fair a one at him. I think it was Urlingford gave the fellow his birth. I doubt whether he will ever see Urlingford again.\" So they walked back, and by the time they had reached the Castle were quite animated and lively with the little incident. \"It may be possible,\" said the Captain to Mr. Jones, \"that he expected my going to Headford. It certainly was known in Galway yesterday, that I was to come across the lake this morning, and the tidings may have come up by some fellow-traveller. He would drop word with some of the boys at Ballintubber as he passed by. And they might have thought it likely that I should go to Headford. They have had their chance on this occasion, and they have not done any good with it.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2744/75559.html","bookId":1377,"book":{"id":1377,"title":"The Landleaguers","description":"简介： In the year 1850 the two estates of Ballintubber and Morony were sold to Mr. Philip Jones, under the Estates Court, which had then been established.
