{"id":11407,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II. THE MAN IN THE MASK.","content":"Edith, before she went to bed that night, crept up to her brother\u0027s bedroom and seated herself on the bedside. It was a little room which Florian occupied alone, and lay at the back of the house, next to that in which Peter slept. Here, as she sat on the bed, she could see by a glance that young Florian feigned to be asleep. \n \n \"Flory, you are pretending to be asleep.\" Flory uttered a short snore,—or rather snort, for he was not a good actor. \"You may as well wake up, because otherwise I shall shake you.\" \n \n \"Why am I to be shaked up in bed?\" \n \n \"Because I want to speak to you.\" \n \n \"Why am I to be made to speak when I want to sleep?\" \n \n \"Papa has been talking about you downstairs. He has come home from Ballintubber, very tired and very unhappy, and he thinks you have been made to go to bed without your supper because we have been attacking you about religion. I have told him that nobody has said a word to you.\" \n \n \"But you did.\" \n \n \"Not a word.\" \n \n \"You didn\u0027t tell him all that you told me—about letting in the water?\" This was asked in a tone of great anxiety. \n \n \"Not a word,—not as yet.\" \n \n \"And you won\u0027t? Mind, I tell you it\u0027s all untrue. What do I know about letting in the water?\" \n \n \"Who did it?\" \n \n \"I\u0027m not going to tell.\" \n \n \"You know, then?\" \n \n \"No, I don\u0027t. But I\u0027m not going to tell as though I knew it. You don\u0027t care about it in your religion, but we Catholics don\u0027t like telling lies.\" \n \n \"You saw nothing?\" \n \n \"Whatever I saw I\u0027m not to tell a lie about it.\" \n \n \"You\u0027ve promised not, you mean?\" \n \n \"Now, Edy, you\u0027re not going to trap me. You\u0027ve got your own religion and I\u0027ve got mine. It\u0027s a great thing in our religion to be able to hold your tongue. Father Malachi says it\u0027s one of the greatest trials which a man has to go through.\" \n \n \"Then, Flory, am I to gather that you will say nothing further to me?\" Here the boy shook his head. \"Because in that case I must tell father. At any rate, he must be told, and if you do not tell him, I shall.\" \n \n \"What is there to be told?\" \n \n \"I shall tell him exactly what I saw,—and Ada. I saw,—we saw,—that when the news came about the flood, you were conscious of it all. If you will go to father and tell him the truth he will be but very little angry with you. I don\u0027t suppose you had a hand in it yourself.\" \n \n \"No!\" shouted the boy. \n \n \"But I think you saw it, and that they made you swear an oath. Was that not so?\" \n \n \"No!\" whispered the boy. \n \n \"I am sure it was so.\" Then the boy again plucked up his courage, and declared with a loud voice, that it was not so. \n \n That night before she retired to rest, Edith went to her father and told him all that she had to say. She took Ada with her, and together they used all their eloquence to make their father believe as they believed. \n \n \"No,\" said Edith, \"he has not confessed. But words drop from him which make us sure that he knows who did it. I am certain that he saw it done. I don\u0027t mean to say that he saw the whole thing. The water, I suppose, was coming in all night.\" \n \n \"The whole night! While we were sleeping in our beds, the waters of the lough were ruining me,\" said the father. \n \n \"But he saw enough to be able to tell you who did it.\" \n \n \"I know who did it. It was that ruffian Carroll.\" \n \n \"But father, you will want evidence.\" \n \n \"Am I to bring up my own boy to swear that he was there, witnessing what was done, as the friend of my enemies? I do not believe that he was there at all.\" \n \n \"If you question him, he will probably own to it. It will be better to get at the truth and face it. He is only ten years old. You must tell me the story of his pretended conversion.\" \n \n \"Why should it be pretended?\" asked the father. \n \n \"Well; of his conversion,\" said Edith. \n \n \"I don\u0027t see what it has to do with it? Am I to put myself forward as a bigoted Protestant? Florian has been foolish, but am I to say that I am angry, where I am not angry—not specially angry.\" \n \n \"It will show the influence under which he has taken up Carroll\u0027s side,\" said Edith. \n \n \"Or the influence under which he has been made to hold his tongue,\" said Ada. \n \n \"Just so,\" said Edith. \"We do not think that he has made one with your enemies in the matter. But he has seen them at work and has been made to promise that he will hold his tongue. I don\u0027t suppose you mean to let the affair slip by without punishing any one.\" \n \n When the girls left him, Mr. Jones was by no means persuaded. As far as he could ascertain from examination of the persons about the locality, there was no one willing to state in evidence that he had seen anything. The injury had been done in November, on a wet, dreary, dull afternoon. He did learn that at half-past three the meadows were in their usual condition. As to the sluices, the gates of which had been pulled out and thrown away in twenty different places, he could learn nothing; no one had seen a sluice gate touched. As to Florian, and what Florian had been seen to do, he had asked no question, because Florian\u0027s name had not then been mentioned. But he had been struck by the awful silence of the people. There were women there, living on the spot, with whose families his family had been on the most kindly terms. When rheumatism was rife,—and rheumatism down on the lough side had often been rife—they had all come up to the Castle for port wine and solace. He had refused them nothing,—he, or his dear wife, who had gone, or his daughters; and, to give them their due, they had always been willing to work for him at a moment\u0027s notice. He would have declared that no man in Ireland was on better terms with his tenantry than he; and now, because there had been a quarrel between him and that pestilent fellow Carroll,—whom he had been willing to buy out from his bit of land and let him go to America, so that they might all be at peace,—could they all have turned against him and taken Carroll\u0027s part? As far as he had been able to gather the feelings of the people, from conversations with them, they had all acknowledged Carroll to be wrong. He would have said that there was not one among them who was not his friend rather than Carroll\u0027s. He was aware that there had been ill-feeling about in other parts of the country. There had been,—so he was told,—a few demagogues in Galway town, American chiefly, who had come thither to do what harm they could; and he had heard that there was discontent in parts of Mayo, about Ballyhaunis and Lough Glinn; but where he lived, round Lough Corrib, there had been no evil symptoms of such a nature. Now suddenly he found himself as though surrounded by a nest of hornets. There were eighty acres of his land under water, and no one would tell him how it was done, or by whom. \n \n And now, to make the matter worse, there had come upon him this trouble with reference to his own boy. He would not believe the story which his daughters had told him; and yet he knew within his heart that they were infinitely the better worthy of credit. He believed in them. He knew them to be good and honest and zealous on his behalf; but how much better did he love poor Florian! And in this matter of the child\u0027s change of religion, in which he had foolishly taken the child\u0027s part, he could not but think that Father Malachi had been most unkind to him; not that he knew what Father Malachi had done in the matter, but Florian talked as though he had been supported all through by the priest. Father Malachi had, in truth, done very little. He had told the boy to go to his father. The boy had said that he had done so, and that his father had assented. \"But Frank and the girls are totally against it. They have no sense of religion at all.\" Then Father Malachi had told him to say his prayers, and come regularly to mass. \n \n Mr. Jones agreed with his daughters that it behoved him to punish the culprit in this matter, but, nevertheless, he thought that it would be better for him to let it go unpunished than to bring his boy into collision with such a one as Pat Carroll. He twice talked the matter over with Florian, and twice did so to no effect. At first he threatened the young sinner, and frowned at him. But his frowns did no good. Florian, if he could stand firm against his sister Edith, was sure that he could do so against his father. Then Mr. Jones spoke him fair, and endeavoured to explain to him how sad a thing it would be if his boy were to turn against his own father and the interests of the family generally. \n \n \"But I haven\u0027t,\" said Florian confidently. \n \n \"You should tell me what you saw on that afternoon.\" \n \n \"I didn\u0027t see anything,\" said Florian sulkily. \n \n \"I don\u0027t believe he knew anything about it,\" said Mr. Jones to Edith afterwards. Edith could only receive this in silence, and keep her own opinion to herself. Ada was altogether of her mind, but Frank at last came round to his father\u0027s view. \"It isn\u0027t probable,\" he said to his sisters, \"that a boy of his age should be able to keep such a secret against four of us; and then it is most improbable that he should have seen anything of the occurrence and not have come at once to his father.\" But the girls held to their own opinion, till at last they were told by Frank that they were two pig-headed nincompoops. \n \n Things were going on in this way, and Mr. Jones was still striving to find out evidence by which a case might be substantiated against Pat Carroll, when that gentleman, one winter afternoon, was using his eloquence upon Master Florian Jones. It was four o\u0027clock, and the darkness of the night was now coming on very quickly. The scene was a cottage, almost in the town of Headford, and about two miles from the nearest part of the Morony estate. In this cottage Carroll was sitting at one side of a turf fire, while an old woman was standing by the doorway making a stocking. And in this cottage also was another man, whose face was concealed by an old crape mask, which covered his eyes and nose and mouth. He was standing on the other side of the fireplace, and Florian was seated on a stool in front of the fire. Ever and anon he turned his gaze round on the mysterious man in the mask, whom he did not at all know; and, in truth, he was frightened awfully through the whole interview by the man in the mask, who stood there by the fireside, almost close to Florian\u0027s elbow, without speaking a word; nor did the old woman say much, though it must be presumed that she heard all that was said. \n \n \"Faix, Mr. Flory, an\u0027 it\u0027s well for you you\u0027ve come,\" said Carroll. \"Jist you sit steady there, \u0027cause it won\u0027t do the laist good in life you\u0027re moving about where all the world\u0027d see you.\" It was thus that the boy was addressed by him, whom we may now call his co-conspirator, and Carroll showed plainly, by his movements and by the glances which he cast around him, that he understood perfectly the dreadful nature of the business in which he was engaged. \"You see that jintl\u0027man there?\" And Carroll pointed to the man in the mask. \n \n \"I see him,\" said poor Florian, almost in tears. \n \n \"You\u0027d better mark him, that\u0027s all. If he cotches a hould o\u0027ye he\u0027d tear ye to tatthers, that\u0027s all. Not that he\u0027d do ye the laist harum in life if ye\u0027d just hould yer pace, and say nothin\u0027 to nobody.\" \n \n \"Not a word I\u0027ll say, Pat.\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t! That\u0027s all about it. Don\u0027t! We knows,—he knows,—what they\u0027re driving at down at the Castle. Sorra a word comes out of the mouth o\u0027 one on \u0027em, but that he knows it.\" Here the man in the mask shook his head and looked as horrible as a man in a mask can look. \"They\u0027ll tell ye that the father who owns ye ought to know all about it. It\u0027s just him as shouldn\u0027t know.\" \n \n \"He don\u0027t,\" said Florian. \n \n \"Not a know;—an\u0027 if you main to keep yourself from being holed as they holed Muster Bingham the other day away at Hollymount.\" The boy understood perfectly well what was meant by the process of \"holing.\" The Mr. Bingham, a small landlord, who had been acting as his own agent some twenty miles off, in the County of Mayo, had been frightfully murdered three months since. It was the first murder that had stained the quarrel which had now commenced in that part of the country. Mr. Bingham had been unpopular, but he had had to deal with such a small property, that no one had imagined that an attack would be made on him. But he had been shot down as he was driving home from Hollymount, whither he had gone to receive rent. He had been shot down during daylight, and no one had as yet been brought to justice for the murder. \"You mind\u0027s Muster Bingham, Muster Flory; eh? He\u0027s gone, and sorra a soul knows anything about it. It\u0027s I\u0027d be sorry to think you\u0027d be polished off that way.\" Again the man in the mask made signs that he was wide awake. \n \n To tell the truth of Florian, he felt rather complimented in the midst of all his horrors in being thus threatened with the fate of Mr. Bingham. He had heard much about Mr. Bingham, and regarded him as a person of much importance since his death. He was raised to a level now with Mr. Bingham. And then his immediate position was very much better than Bingham\u0027s. He was alive, and up to the present moment,—as long as he held his tongue and told nothing,—he would be regarded with friendly eyes by that terrible man in the mask. But, through it all, there was the agonising feeling that he was betraying them all at home. His father and Edith and Frank would not murder him when they found him out, but they would despise him. And the boy knew something,—he knew much of what was due by him to his father. At this moment he was much in dread of Pat Carroll. He was in greater dread of the man in the mask. But as he sat there, terrified by them as they intended to terrify him, he was aware of all that courage would demand from him. If he could once escape from that horrid cabin, he thought that he might be able to make a clean breast and tell everything. \"It\u0027s I that\u0027d be awful sorry that anything like what happened Bingham, should happen to you, Muster Flory.\" \n \n \"Why wouldn\u0027t you; and I\u0027d have done nothing against you?\" said Florian. He did feel that his conduct up to the present moment deserved more of gratitude than of threats from Pat Carroll. \n \n \"You\u0027re to remimber your oath, Muster Flory. You\u0027re become one of us, as Father Brosnan was telling you. You\u0027re not to be one of us, and then go over among them schaming Prothestants.\" \n \n \"I haven\u0027t gone over among them,—only my father is one of them.\" \n \n \"What\u0027s yer father to do with it now you\u0027re a Catholic? Av you is ever false to a Catholic on behalf of them Prothestants, though he\u0027s twice yer own father, you\u0027d go t\u0027 hell for it; that\u0027s where you\u0027d be going. And it\u0027s not only that, but the jintl\u0027man as is there will be sending you on the journey.\" Then Pat signified that he alluded to the man in the mask, and the gentleman in the mask clenched his fist and shook it,—and shook his head also. \"You ask Father Brosnan also, whether you ain\u0027t to be thrue to us Catholics now you\u0027re one of us? It\u0027s a great favour as has been done you. You\u0027re mindful o\u0027 that—ain\u0027t you?\" Poor Flory said that he was mindful. \n \n Here they were joined by another conspirator, a man whom Florian had seen down by the sluices with Pat Carroll, and whom he thought he remembered to have noticed among the tenants from the other side of Ballintubber. \"What\u0027s the chap up to now?\" asked the stranger. \n \n \"He ain\u0027t up to nothin\u0027,\" said Carroll. \"We\u0027re only a cautioning of him.\" \n \n \"Not to be splitting on yourself?\" \n \n \"Nor yet on you,\" said Carroll. \n \n \"Sorra a word he can say agin me,\" said the stranger. \"I wasn\u0027t in it at all.\" \n \n \"But you was,\" said Florian. \"I saw you pick the latch up and throw it away.\" \n \n \"You\u0027ve sharp eyes, ain\u0027t you, to be seeing what warn\u0027t there to be seen at all? If you say you saw me in it, I\u0027ll have the tongue out of your mouth, you young liar.\" \n \n \"What\u0027s the good of frightening the boy, Michael. He\u0027s a good boy, and isn\u0027t a going to peach upon any of us.\" \n \n \"But I ain\u0027t a liar. He\u0027s a liar.\" This Florian said, plucking up renewed courage from the kind words Pat Carroll had said in his favour. \n \n \"Never mind,\" said Pat, throwing oil on the troubled waters. \"We\u0027re all frinds at present, and shall be as long as we don\u0027t split on nobody.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s the meanest thing out,—that splitting on a pal,\" said the man who had been called Michael. \"It\u0027s twice worse when one does it to one\u0027s father. I wouldn\u0027t show a ha\u0027porth of mercy to such a chap as that.\" \n \n \"And to a Catholic as peached to a Prothestant,\" said Carroll, intending to signify his hatred of such a wretch by spitting on the ground. \n \n \"Or to a son as split because his father was in question.\" Then Michael spat twice upon the floor, showing the extremity of the disgust which in such a case would overpower him. \n \n \"I suppose I may go now,\" said Florian. He was told by Pat Carroll that he might go. But just at that moment the man in the mask, who had not spoken a word, extemporised a cross out of two bits of burned wood from the hearth, and put it right before Florian\u0027s nose; one hand held one stick, and the other, the other. \"Swear,\" said the man in the mask. \n \n \"Bedad! he\u0027s in the right of it. Another oath will make it all the stronger. \u0027That ye\u0027ll never say a word of this to mortial ears, whether father or sister or brother, let \u0027em say what they will to yer, s\u0027help yer the Blessed Virgin.\u0027\" \n \n \"I won\u0027t then,\" said Florian, struggling to get at the cross to kiss it. \n \n \"Stop a moment, me fine fellow,\" said Michael. \"Nor yet to no one else—and you\u0027ll give yourself up to hell flames av you don\u0027t keep the blessed oath to the last day of your life. Now let him kiss it, Pat. I wouldn\u0027t be in his shoes for a ten-pun note if he breaks that oath.\" \n \n \"Nor I neither,\" said Pat. \"Oh laws, no.\" Then Florian was allowed to escape from the cabin. This he did, and going out into the dark, and looking about him to see that he was not watched, made his way in at the back door of a fairly large house which stood near, still in the outskirts of the town of Headford. It was a fairly large house in Headford; but Headford does not contain many large houses. It was that in which lived Father Giles, the old parish priest of Tuam;—and with Father Giles lived his curate, that Father Brosnan of whom mention has above been made. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2744/75540.html","bookId":1377,"book":{"id":1377,"title":"The Landleaguers","description":"简介： In the year 1850 the two estates of Ballintubber and Morony were sold to Mr. Philip Jones, under the Estates Court, which had then been established.
