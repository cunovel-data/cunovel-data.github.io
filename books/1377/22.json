{"id":11427,"no":22,"title":"CHAPTER XXII. MORONY CASTLE IS BOYCOTTED.","content":"The men seemed to make a good joke of the afternoon\u0027s employment, but not so the young ladies. In the evening they had a little music, and Captain Clayton declared that the Miss Ormesbys were grand performers. \"And I am told that they are lovely girls,\" said Ada. \"Well, yes; lovely is a very strong word.\" \"I\u0027d rather be called lovely than anything,\" said Ada. \"Now, Captain Clayton,\" said Edith, \"if you wish for my respect, don\u0027t fall into the trap which Ada has so openly laid for you.\" \"I meant nothing of the kind,\" said Ada. \"I hope that Captain Clayton knows me better. But, Captain Clayton, you don\u0027t mean that you\u0027ll walk down to the boat to-morrow?\" \"Why not? He\u0027ll never have the pluck to fire at me two days running. And I doubt whether he\u0027ll allow me so fair a chance of seeing him.\" \"I wonder how you can sleep at night, knowing that such a man as this is always after your life.\" \"I wonder whether he sleeps at night, when he thinks such a man as I am after his life. And I allow him, to boot, all his walks and hiding-places.\" Then Ada began to implore him not to be too rash. She endeavoured to teach him that no good could come from such foolhardiness. If his life was of no value to himself, it was of great value to others;—to his mother, for instance, and to his sister. \"A man\u0027s life is of no real value,\" said the Captain, \"until he has got a wife and family—or at any rate, a wife.\" \"You don\u0027t think the wife that is to be need mind it?\" said Edith. \"The wife that is to be must be in the clouds, and in all probability, will never come any nearer. I cannot allow that a man can be justified in neglecting his duties for the sake of a cloudy wife.\" \"Not in neglecting absolute duties,\" said Ada, sadly. \"A man in my position neglects his duty if he leaves a stone unturned in pursuit of such a blackguard as this. And when a man is used to it, he likes it. There\u0027s your brother quite enjoyed being shot at, just as though he were resident magistrate; at any rate, he looked as though he did.\" So the conversation went on through the evening, during the whole of which poor Florian made one of the party. He said very little, but sat close to his sister Edith, who frequently had his hand in her own. The Captain constantly had his eye upon him without seeming to watch him, but still was thinking of him as the minutes flew by. It was not that the boy was in danger; for the Captain thought the danger to be small, and that it was reduced almost to nothing as long as he remained in the house,—but what would be the effect of fear on the boy\u0027s mind? And if he were thus harassed could he be expected to give his evidence in a clear manner? Mr. Jones was not present after dinner, having retired at once to his own room. But just as the girls had risen to go to bed, and as Florian was preparing to accompany them, Peter brought a message saying that Mr. Jones would be glad to see Captain Clayton before he went for the night. Then the Captain got up, and bidding them all farewell, followed Peter to Mr. Jones\u0027s room. \"I shall go on by the early boat,\" he said as he was leaving the room. \"You\u0027ll have breakfast first, at any rate,\" said Ada. The Captain swore that he wouldn\u0027t, and the girls swore that he should. \"We never let anybody go without breakfast,\" said Ada. \"And particularly not a man,\" said Edith, \"who has just been shot at on our behalf,\" But the Captain explained that it might be as well that he should be down waiting for the boat half an hour at any rate before it started. \"I and Hunter,\" said he, \"would have a fair look out around us there, so that no one could get within rifle shot of us without our seeing them, and they won\u0027t look out for us so early. I don\u0027t think much of Mr. Lax\u0027s courage, but it may be as well to keep a watch when it can be so easily done.\" Then Ada went off to her bed, resolving that the breakfast should be ready, though it was an hour before the boat time. The boat called at the wharf at eight in the morning, and the wharf was three miles distant from the house. She could manage to have breakfast ready at half-past six. \"Ada, my girl,\" said Edith, as they departed together, \"don\u0027t you make a fool of that young man.\" \"What do you mean by that?\" \"Didn\u0027t you tell me that a man who has to be shot at ought not to be married; and didn\u0027t he say that he would leave his future wife up among the clouds?\" \"He may leave her where he likes for me,\" said Ada. \"When a man is doing so much for us oughtn\u0027t he to have his breakfast ready for him at half-past six o\u0027clock?\" There was no more then said between them on that subject; but Edith resolved that as far as boiling the water was concerned, she would be up as soon as Ada. When the Captain went into Mr. Jones\u0027s room he was asked to sit down, and had a cigar offered to him. \"Thanks, no; I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll smoke. Smoking may have some sort of effect on a fellow\u0027s hand. There\u0027s a gentleman in these parts who I should be sorry should owe his life to any little indulgence of that sort on my behalf.\" \"You are thinking of the man who fired at you?\" \"Well, yes; I am. Not that I shall have any chance at him just at present. He won\u0027t come near me again this visit. The next that I shall hear from him will be from round some corner in the neighbourhood of Galway. I think I know every turn in that blackguard\u0027s mind.\" \"Have you been speaking to Florian about him, Captain Clayton?\" \"Not a word.\" \"Nor has his brother?\" \"I think not.\" \"What am I to do about the poor boy?\" said the anxious father. \"Because of his fear about this very man?\" \"He is only a boy, you know.\" \"Of course he is only a boy. You\u0027ve no right to expect from him the pluck of a man. When he is as old as his brother he\u0027ll have his brother\u0027s nerve. I like to see a man plucky under fire when he is not used to it. When you\u0027ve got into the way of it, it means nothing.\" \"What am I do about Florian? There are four months before the assizes. He cannot remain in the house for four months.\" \"What would he be at the end of it?\" said the Captain. \"That is what we have to think of.\" \"Would it alter him?\" \"I suppose it would,—if he were here with his sister, talking of nothing but this wretched man, who seems to haunt him. We have to remember, Mr. Jones, how long it was before he came forward with his story.\" \"I think he will be firm with it now.\" \"No doubt,—if he had to tell it out in direct evidence. When he is there in the court telling it, he will not think much of Mr. Lax, nor even of Pat Carroll, who will be in the dock glaring at him; nor would he think much of anything but his direct story, while a friendly barrister is drawing it out of him; but when it comes to his cross-examination, it will be different. He will want all his pluck then, and all the simplicity which he can master. You must remember that a skilful man will have been turned loose on him with all the ferocity of a bloodhound; a man who will have all the cruelty of Lax, but will have nothing to fear; a man who will be serving his purpose all round if he can only dumbfound that poor boy by his words and his looks. A man, when he has taken up the cause of these ruffians, learns to sympathise with them. If they hate the Queen, hate the laws, hate all justice, these men learn to hate them too. When they get hold of me, and I look into the eyes of such a one, I see there my bitterest enemy. He holds Captain Yorke Clayton up to the hatred of the whole court, as though he were a brute unworthy of the slightest mercy,—a venomous reptile, against whom the whole country should rise to tear him in pieces. And I look round and see the same feeling written in the eyes of them all. I found it more hard to get used to that than to the snap of a pistol; but I have got used to it. Poor Florian will have had no such experience. And there will be no mercy shown to him because he is only a boy. Neither sex nor age is supposed to render any such feeling necessary to a lawyer. A lawyer in defending the worst ruffian that ever committed a crime will know that he is called upon to spare nothing that is tender. He is absolved from all the laws common to humanity. And then poor Florian has lied.\" A gloomy look of sad, dull pain came across the father\u0027s brow as he heard these words. \"We must look it in the face, Mr. Jones.\" \"Yes, look it all in the face.\" \"He has repeated the lie again and again for six months. He has been in close friendship with these men. It will be made out that he has been present at all their secret meetings. He has been present at some of them. It will be very hard to get a jury to convict on his evidence if it be unsupported.\" \"Shall we withdraw him?\" asked Mr. Jones. \"You cannot do it. His deposition has been sworn and put forward in the proper course. Besides it is his duty and yours,—and mine,\" he added. \"He must tell his story once again, and must endure whatever torment the law-rebels of the court have in store for him. Only it will be well to think what course of treatment may best prepare him for the trial. You should treat him with the greatest kindness.\" \"He is treated kindly.\" \"But you, I think, and his sisters and his brother should endeavour to make him feel that you do not think harshly of him because of the falsehoods he has told. Go out with him occasionally.\" Here Mr. Jones raised his eyebrows as feeling surprised at the kind of counsel given. \"Put some constraint on yourself so as to make him feel by the time he has to go into court with you that he has a friend with him.\" \"I trust that he always feels that,\" said Mr. Jones. They went on discussing the matter till late at night, and Captain Clayton made the father understand what it was that he intended. He meant that the boy should be made to know that his father was to him as are other fathers, in spite of the lie which he had told, and of the terrible trouble which he had caused by telling it. But Mr. Jones felt that the task imposed upon him would be almost impossible. He was heavy at heart, and unable to recall to himself his old spirits. He had been thoroughly ashamed of his son, and was not possessed of that agility of heart which is able to leap into good-humour at once. Florian had been restored to his old manner of life; sitting at table with his father and occasionally spoken to by him. He had been so far forgiven; but the father was still aware that there was still a dismal gap between himself and his younger boy, as regarded that affectionate intercourse which Captain Clayton recommended. And yet he knew that it was needed, and resolved that he would do his best, however imperfectly it might be done. On the next morning the Captain went his way, and did ample homage to the kindly exertions made on his behalf by the two girls. \"Now I know you must have been up all night, for you couldn\u0027t have done it all without a servant in the house.\" \"How dare you belittle our establishment!\" said Ada. \"What do you think of Peter? Is Peter nobody? And it was poor Florian who boiled the kettle. I really don\u0027t know whether we should not get on better altogether without servants than with them.\" The breakfast was eaten both by the Captain in the parlour and by Hunter in the kitchen in great good humour. \"Now, my fine fellow,\" said the former, \"have you got your pistols ready? I don\u0027t think we shall want them this morning, but it\u0027s as well not to give these fellows a chance.\" Hunter was pleased by being thus called into council before the young ladies, and they both started in the highest good humour. Captain Clayton, as he went, told himself that Ada Jones was the prettiest girl of his acquaintance. His last sentimental affinity with the youngest Miss Ormesby waxed feeble and insipid as he thought of Ada. Perhaps Edith, he said to himself, is the sharpest of the two, but in good looks she can\u0027t hold a candle to her sister. So he passed on, and with his myrmidon reached Galway, without incurring any impediment from Mr. Lax. In the course of the morning, Mr. Jones sent for Florian, and proposed to walk out with him about the demesne. \"I don\u0027t think there will be any danger,\" he said. \"Captain Clayton went this morning, and the people don\u0027t know yet whether he has gone. I think it is better that you should get accustomed to it, and not give way to idle fears.\" The boy apparently agreed to this, and got his hat. But he did not leave the shelter of the house without sundry misgivings. Mr. Jones had determined to act at once upon the Captain\u0027s advice, and had bethought himself that he could best do so by telling the whole truth to the boy. \"Now, Florian, I think it would be as well that you and I should understand each other.\" Florian looked up at him with fearful eyes, but made no reply. \"Of course I was angry with you while you were hesitating about those ruffians.\" \"Yes; you were,\" said Florian. \"I can quite understand that you have felt a difficulty.\" \"Yes, I did,\" said Florian. \"But that is all over now.\" \"If they don\u0027t fire at me it is over, I suppose, till August.\" \"They shan\u0027t fire at you. Don\u0027t be afraid. If they fire at you, they must fire at me too.\" The father was walking with his arm about the boy\u0027s neck. \"You, at any rate, shall incur no danger which I do not share. You will understand—won\u0027t you—that my anger against you is passed and gone?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" said the boy. \"It is so,—altogether. I hope to be able to send you to school in England very soon after the trial is over. You shall go to Mr. Monro at first, and to Winchester afterwards, if I can manage it. But we won\u0027t think of Winchester just at present. We must do the best we can to get a good place for you on your first going into the school.\" \"I am not afraid about that,\" said Florian, thinking that at the time when the school should have come all the evils of the trials would have been passed away and gone. \"All the same you might come and read with me every morning for an hour, and then for an hour with each of your sisters. You will want something to do to make up your time. And remember, Florian, that all my anger has passed away. We will be the best of friends, as in former days, so that when the time shall have come for you to go into court, you may be quite sure that you have a friend with you there.\" To all this Florian made very little reply; but Mr. Jones remembered that he could not expect to do much at a first attempt. Weary as the task would be he would persevere. For the task would be weary even with his own son. He was a man who could do nothing graciously which he could not do con amore. And he felt that all immediate warm liking for the poor boy had perished in his heart. The boy had made himself the friend of such a one as Pat Carroll, and in his friendship for him had lied grossly. Mr. Jones had told himself that it was his duty to forgive him, and had struggled to perform his duty. For the performance of any deed necessary for the boy\u0027s security, he could count upon himself. But he could not be happy in his company as he was with Edith. The boy had been foully untrue to him—but still he would do his best.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2744/75560.html","bookId":1377,"book":{"id":1377,"title":"The Landleaguers","description":"简介： In the year 1850 the two estates of Ballintubber and Morony were sold to Mr. Philip Jones, under the Estates Court, which had then been established.
