{"id":11443,"no":38,"title":"CHAPTER XXXVIII. LORD CASTLEWELL IS MUCH TROUBLED.","content":"When her father had been with her half-an-hour, and was beginning to think that he could escape and go down to the House,—and he had a rod in pickle for the Speaker\u0027s back, such a rod that the Speaker\u0027s back should be sore for the rest of the session—Rachel began her lengthened conversation with him. In the last half-hour she had made up her mind as to what she would say. But the conversation was so long and intricate, being necessarily carried on by means of her tablet, that poor O\u0027Mahony\u0027s rod was losing all its pickle. \"Father, you must go and see Lord Castlewell at once.\" \"I think, my dear, he understood me altogether when I saw him before, and he seemed to agree with me. I told him I didn\u0027t mind being called an ass, but that you were so absurd as to dislike it. In fact, I gave him to understand that we were three asses; but I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll say it again.\" \"It isn\u0027t about that at all,\" said the tablet. \"What else do you want?\" Then Rachel went to work and wrote her demand with what deliberation she could assume. \"You must go and tell him that I don\u0027t want to marry him at all. He has been very kind, and you mustn\u0027t tell him that he\u0027s an ass any more. But it won\u0027t do. He has proposed to marry me because he has wanted a singing girl; and I think I should have done for him,—only I can\u0027t sing.\" Then the father replied, having put himself into such a position on the bed as to read the tablet while Rachel was filling it: \"But that\u0027ll all come right in a very short time.\" \"It can\u0027t, and it won\u0027t. The doctor says a year; but he knows nothing about it, and says it\u0027s in God\u0027s hands. He means by that it\u0027s as bad as it can be.\" \"But, my dear—\" \"I tell you it must be so.\" \"But you are engaged. He would never be so base a man as to take your word at such a moment as this. Of course he couldn\u0027t do it. If you had had small-pox, or anything horrible like that, he would not have been justified.\" \"I\u0027m as ugly as ever I can be,\" said the tablet, \"and as poor a creature.\" Then she stopped her pencil for a moment. \"Of course he\u0027s engaged to you. Why, my dear, I\u0027d have to cowhide him if he said a word of the kind.\" \"Oh, no!\" said the tablet with frantic energy. \"But you see if I wouldn\u0027t! You see if I don\u0027t! I suppose they think a lord isn\u0027t to be cowhided in this country. I guess I\u0027ll let \u0027em know the difference.\" \"But I don\u0027t love him,\" said the tablet. \"Goodness gracious me!\" \"I don\u0027t. When he spoke of you in that way I began to think of it, and I found I hated him. I do hate him like poison, and I want you to tell him so.\" \"That will be very disagreeable,\" said the father. \"Never mind the disagreeables. You tell him so. I tell you he won\u0027t be the worst pleased of the lot of us. He wanted a singer, and not a Landleaguer\u0027s daughter; now he hasn\u0027t got the singer, but has got the Landleaguer\u0027s daughter. And I\u0027ll tell you something else I want—\" \"What do you want?\" asked the father, when her hand for a moment ceased to scrawl. \"I want,\" she said, \"Frank Jones. Now you know all about it.\" Then she hid her face beneath the bedclothes, and refused to write another word. He went on talking to her till he had forgotten the Speaker and the rod in pickle. He besought her to think better of it; and if not that, just at present to postpone any action in the matter. He explained to her how very disagreeable it would be to him to have to go to the lord with such a message as she now proposed. But she only enhanced the vehemence of her order by shaking her head as her face lay buried in the pillow. \"Let it wait for one fortnight,\" said the father. \"No!\" said the girl, using her own voice for the effort. Then the father slowly took himself off, and making his way to the House of Commons, renewed his passion as he went, and had himself again turned out before he had been half-an-hour in the House. The earl was sitting alone after breakfast two or three days subsequently, thinking in truth of his difficulty with Rachel. It had come to be manifest to him that he must marry the girl unless something terrible should occur to her. \"She might die,\" he said to himself very sadly, trying to think of cases in which singers had died from neglected throats. And it did make him very sad. He could not think of the perishing of that magnificent treble without great grief; and, after his fashion, he did love her personally. He did not know that he could ever love anyone very much better. He had certainly thought that it would be a good thing that his father and mother and sister should go and live in foreign lands,—in order, in short, that they might never more be heard of to trouble him,—but he did not even contemplate their deaths, so sweet-minded was he. But in the first fury of his love he had thought how nice it would be to be left with his singing girl, and no one to trouble him. Now there came across him an idea that something was due to the Marquis of Beaulieu,—something, that is, to his own future position; and what could he do with a singing girl for his wife who could not sing? He was unhappy as he thought of it all, and would ever and again, as he meditated, be stirred up to mild anger when he remembered that he had been told that \"the truth would suffer.\" He had intended, at any rate, that his singing girl should be submissive and obedient while in his hands. But here had been an outbreak of passion! And here was this confounded O\u0027Mahony ready to make a fool of himself at a moment\u0027s notice before all the world. At that moment the door was opened and Mr. O\u0027Mahony was shown into the room. \"Oh! dear,\" exclaimed the lord, \"how do you do, Mr. O\u0027Mahony? I hope I see you well.\" \"Pretty well. But upon my word, I don\u0027t know how to tell you what I\u0027ve got to say.\" \"Has anything gone wrong with Rachel?\" \"Not with her illness,—which, however, does not seem to improve. The poor girl! But you\u0027ll say she\u0027s gone mad.\" \"What do you mean by that?\" \"I really hardly know how I ought to break it. You must have learned by this time that Rachel is a girl determined to have her own way.\" \"Well; well; well!\" \"And, upon my word, when I think of myself, I feel that I have nothing to do but what she bids me.\" \"It\u0027s more than you do for the Speaker, Mr. O\u0027Mahony.\" \"Yes, it is; I admit that. But Rachel, though she is inclined to be tyrannical, is not such a downright positive old blue-bottle nincompoop as that white-wigged king of kings. Rachel is bad; but even you can\u0027t say that she is bad enough to be Speaker of the House of Commons. My belief is, that he\u0027ll come to be locked up yet.\" \"We have all the highest opinion of him.\" \"It\u0027s because you like to be sat upon. You don\u0027t want to be allowed to say bo to a goose. I have often heard in my own country—\" \"But you call yourself an Irishman, Mr. O\u0027Mahony.\" \"Never did so in my life. They called me so over there when they wanted to return me to hold my tongue in that House of Torment; but I guess it will puzzle the best Englishman going to find out whether I\u0027m an American or an Irishman. They did something over there to make me an American; but they did nothing to unmake me as an Irishman. And there I am, member for Cavan; and it will go hard with me if I don\u0027t break that Speaker\u0027s heart before I\u0027ve done with him. What! I ain\u0027t to say that he goes wrong when he never goes right by any chance?\" \"Have you come here this morning, Mr. O\u0027Mahony, to abuse the Speaker?\" \"By no means. It was you who threw the Speaker in my teeth.\" Lord Castlewell did acknowledge to himself his own imprudence. \"I came here to tell you about my daughter, and upon my word I shall find it more difficult than anything I may have to say to the Speaker. I have the most profound contempt for the Speaker.\" \"Perhaps he returns it.\" \"I don\u0027t believe he does, or he wouldn\u0027t make so much of me as to turn me out of the House. When a man finds it necessary to remove an enemy, let the cause be what it may, he cannot be said to despise that enemy. Now, I wouldn\u0027t give a puff of breath to turn him out of the House. In truth, I despise him too much.\" \"He is to be pitied,\" said the lord, with a gentle touch of irony. \"I\u0027ll tell you what, Lord Castlewell—\" \"Don\u0027t go on about the Speaker, Mr. O\u0027Mahony,—pray don\u0027t.\" \"You always begin,—but I won\u0027t. I didn\u0027t come here to speak about him at all. And the Chairman of Committees is positively worse. You know there\u0027s a creature called Chairman of Committees?\" \"Now, Mr. O\u0027Mahony, I really must beg that you will fight your political battles anywhere but here. I\u0027m not a politician. How is your charming daughter this morning?\" \"She is anything but charming. I hardly know what to make of her, but I find that I am always obliged to do what she tells me.\" There was another allusion to the Speaker on the lord\u0027s tongue, but he restrained himself. \"She has sent me here to say that she wants the marriage to be broken off.\" \"Good Heavens!\" \"She does. She says that you intend to marry her because she\u0027s a singing girl;—and now she can\u0027t sing.\" \"Not exactly that,\" said the lord. \"And she thinks she oughtn\u0027t to have accepted you at all,—that\u0027s the truth.\" The lord\u0027s face became very long. \"I think myself that it was a little too hurried. I don\u0027t suppose you quite knew your own minds.\" \"If Miss O\u0027Mahony repents—\" \"Well, Miss O\u0027Mahony does repent. She has got something into her head that I can\u0027t quite explain. She thought that she\u0027d do for a countess very well as long as she was on the boards of a theatre. But now that she\u0027s to be relegated to private life she begins to feel that she ought to look after someone about her own age.\" \"Oh, indeed! Is this her message?\" \"Well; yes. It is her message. I shouldn\u0027t in such a matter invent it all if she hadn\u0027t sent me. I don\u0027t know, now I think of it, that she did say anything about her own age. But yet she did,\" remarked Mr. O\u0027Mahony, calling to mind the assertion made by Rachel that she wanted Frank Jones. Frank Jones was about her own age, whereas the lord was as old as her father. \"Upon my word, I am much obliged to Miss O\u0027Mahony.\" \"She certainly has meant to be as courteous as she knows how,\" said Mr. O\u0027Mahony. \"Perhaps on your side of the water they have different ideas of courtesy. The young lady sends me word that now she means to retire from the stage she finds I am too old for her.\" \"Not that at all,\" said Mr. O\u0027Mahony. But he said it in an apologetic tone, as though admitting the truth. Lord Castlewell, as he sat there for a few moments, acknowledged to himself that Rachel possessed certain traits of character which had something fine about them, from whatever side of the water she had come. He was a reasonable man, and he considered that there was a way made for him to escape from this trouble which was not to have been expected. Had Rachel been an English girl, or an Italian, or a Norwegian, he would hardly have been let off so easily. As he was an earl, and about to be a marquis, and as he was a rich man, such suitors are not generally given up in a hurry. This young lady had sent word to him that she had lost her voice permanently and was therefore obliged to surrender that high title, that noble name, and those golden hopes which had glistened before her eyes. No doubt he had offered to marry her because of her singing;—that is, he would not have so offered had she not have been a singer. But he could not have departed from his engagement simply because she had become dumb. He quite understood that Mr. O\u0027Mahony would have been there with his cowhide, and though he was by no means a coward be did not wish to encounter the American Member of the House of Commons in all his rage. In fact, he had been governed in his previous ideas by a feeling of propriety; but propriety certainly did not demand him to marry a young lady who had sent to tell him that he was too old. And this irate member of the House of Commons had come to bring him the message! \"What am I expected to suggest now?\" said Lord Castlewell, after awhile. \"Just your affectionate blessing, and you\u0027re very sorry,\" said Mr. O\u0027Mahony, with a shrug. \"That\u0027s the kind of thing, I should say.\" He couldn\u0027t send her his affectionate blessing, and he couldn\u0027t say he was very sorry. Had the young lady been about to marry his son,—had there been such a son,—he could have blessed her; and he felt that his own personal dignity did not admit of an expression of sorrow. Was he to let the young lady off altogether? There was something nearly akin,—very nearly akin,—to true love in his bosom as he thought of this. The girl was ill, and no doubt weak, and had been made miserable by the loss of her voice. The doctor had told him that her voice, for all singing purposes, had probably gone for ever. But her beauty remained;—had not so faded, at least, as to have given any token of permanent decay. And that peculiarly bright eye was there; and the wit of the words which had captivated him. The very smallness of her stature, with its perfect symmetry, had also gone far to enrapture him. No doubt, he was forty. He did not openly pretend even to be less. And where was the young lady, singer or no singer, who if disengaged, would reject the heir to a marquisate because he was forty? And he did not believe that Rachel had sent him any message in which allusion was made to his age. That had been added by the stupid father, who was, without doubt, the biggest fool that either America or Ireland had ever produced. Now that the matter had been brought before him in such bald terms, he was by no means sure that he was desirous of accepting the girl\u0027s offer to release him. And the father evidently had no desire to catch him. He must acknowledge that Mr. O\u0027Mahony was an honest fool. \"It\u0027s very hard to know what I\u0027m to say.\" Here Mr. O\u0027Mahony shook his head. \"I think that, perhaps, I had better come and call upon her.\" \"You mustn\u0027t speak a word! And, if you\u0027re to be considered as no longer engaged, perhaps there might be—you know—something—well, something of delicacy in the matter!\" Mr. O\u0027Mahony felt at the moment that he ought to protect the interests of Frank Jones. \"I understand. At any rate I am not disposed to send her my blessing at present as a final step. An engagement to be married is a very serious step in life.\" But her father remembered that she had told him that she wanted Frank Jones. Should he tell the lord the exact truth, and explain all about Frank Jones? It would be the honest thing to do. And yet he felt that his girl should have another chance. This lord was not much to his taste; but still, for a lord, he had his good points. \"I think we had better leave it for the present,\" said the lord. \"I feel that in the midst of all your eloquence I do not quite catch Miss O\u0027Mahony\u0027s meaning.\" O\u0027Mahony felt that this lord was as bad a lord as any of them. He would like to force the lord to meet him at some debating club where there was no wretched Speaker and there force him to give an answer on any of the burning questions which now excited the two countries. \"Very well. I will explain to Rachel as soon as I can that the matter is still left in abeyance. Of course we feel the honour done us by your lordship in not desiring to accept at once her decision. Her condition is no doubt sad. But I suppose she may expect to hear once more from yourself in a short time.\" So Mr. O\u0027Mahony took his leave, and as he went to Cecil Street endeavoured in his own mind to investigate the character of Lord Castlewell. That he was a fool there could be no doubt, a fool with whom he would not be forced to live in the constant intercourse of married life for any money that could be offered to him. He was a man who, without singing himself, cared for nothing but the second-hand life of a theatre. But then he, Mr. O\u0027Mahony, was not a young woman, and was not expected to marry Lord Castlewell. But he had told himself over and over again that Lord Castlewell had been \"caught.\" He was a great lord rolling in money, and Rachel had \"caught\" him. He had not quite approved of Rachel\u0027s conduct, but the lord had been fair game for a woman. What the deuce was he to think now of the lord who would not be let off? \"I wonder whether it can be love for her,\" said he to himself; \"such love as I used to feel.\" Then he sighed heavily as he went home.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2744/75576.html","bookId":1377,"book":{"id":1377,"title":"The Landleaguers","description":"简介： In the year 1850 the two estates of Ballintubber and Morony were sold to Mr. Philip Jones, under the Estates Court, which had then been established.
