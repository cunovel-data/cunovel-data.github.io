{"id":11411,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER VI. RACHEL AND HER LOVERS.","content":"On the day following that of O\u0027Mahony\u0027s return to Galway, he, and his daughter, and Frank Jones were together at the Galway Station preparatory to the departure of the O\u0027Mahonys for Dublin and London. \"I guess you two have got something to say to each other, so I\u0027ll leave you to yourselves,\" said the father. \n \n \"I guess we have,\" said Rachel, \"so if you\u0027ll wait here we\u0027ll come to you when the cars are fixed.\" So saying, Rachel put her hand on her lover\u0027s arm and walked off with him along the platform. Rachel O\u0027Mahony had not been badly described when her father said of her that she looked as though she might be blown away. She was very fair, and small and frail to look at. Her father had also said of her that her health was remarkably good,—\"the best confirmed that he had ever known in his life.\" But though this too, was true, she hardly looked it. No one could have pointed out any sign of malady about her; only one would have said that there was nothing of her. And the colour on her face was so evanescent that he who watched her was inclined to think that she herself was like her colour. And she moved as though she was always on the vanishing point. \"I\u0027m very fond of eating,\" she had been heard to say. \"I know it\u0027s vulgar; but it\u0027s true.\" No doubt she was fond of eating, but so is a sparrow. There was nothing she would not attempt to do in the way of taking exercise. She would undertake very long walks, and would then fail, and declare that she must be carried home; but she would finally get through the day\u0027s work better than another woman who appeared to have double her strength. Her feet and hands were the tiniest little adjuncts to a grown human body that could be seen anywhere. They looked at least to be so. But they were in perfect symmetry with her legs and arms. \"I wish I were bigger,\" she had once been heard to say, \"because I could hit a man.\" The man to whom she alluded was Mr. Mahomet M. Moss. \"I sometimes want to hit a woman, but that would be such a small triumph.\" And yet she had a pride in her little female fineries. \"Now, Frank,\" she had once said, \"I guess you won\u0027t get another woman in all Galway to put her foot into that boot; nor yet in New York either.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t think I could,\" said the enraptured Frank. \n \n \"You\u0027d better take it to New York and try, and if you find the lady you can bring her back with you.\" \n \n Frank refused the commission, saying something of course very pretty as to his mistress\u0027s foot. \"Ten buttons! These only have eight,\" she said, objecting to a present which her lover had just brought her. \"If I had ten buttons, and the gloves to fit me, I\u0027d cut my arm off and put it under a glass case. Lovers are sent out to do all possible and impossible things in order to deserve their lady-loves. You shall go and wander about till you find a glove with ten buttons to fit me, then I\u0027ll consent to be Mrs.——Jones.\" By all of which little man?uvres Frank was charmed and oppressed to the last degree. When she would call herself the \"future Mrs.——Jones,\" he would almost feel inclined to abandon both the name and the property. \"Why not be Mrs. Morony,\" Rachel would say, \"or Mrs. Ballintubber? The Ballintubber, of Ballintubber, would sound exquisitely, and then I should always be called \u0027Madam.\u0027\" \n \n Her beauty was all but perfect, as far as symmetry was concerned, only that there was not enough of it; and for the perfection of female beauty a tone of colour is, methinks, needed somewhat darker than that which prevailed with Rachel O\u0027Mahony. Her hair was so light that one felt it rather than saw it, as one feels the sunlight. It was soft and feathery, as is the under plumage on the wings of some small tropical birds. \"A lock of my hair!\" she had once said to Frank; \"but it will all go into nothing. You should have paid your vows to some girl who could give you a good lump of hair fit to stuff a pillow with. If you have mine you will think in a few weeks that the spiders have been there and have left their dust behind.\" But she gave him the lock of hair, and laid it on his lips with her own little hands. \n \n There was not enough of her beauty. Even in touching her a lover could not but feel that he had to deal with a little child. In looking at her he could only look down upon her. It was not till she spoke, and that her words came to his assistance, that he found that he had to deal with one who was not altogether a child. \"Mr. Mahomet M. Moss declares his opinion that I shall be seen above the gaslights. It was very civil and complimentary of Mahomet M. M. But I mean to make myself heard. Mahomet M. M. did not seem to think of this.\" Since Frank had known her she had taken every opportunity in her power of belittling Mahomet M. M., as she was wont to call Mr. Moss. \n \n Frank Jones was, in truth, a handsome stalwart young man, clever enough for the world, who thought a good deal of himself, and who thought very much more of the girl whom he loved. It was chiefly because he was absolutely unlike an American that Rachel O\u0027Mahony had come to love him. Who does not know the \"got up\" look of the gentleman from the other side of the water, who seems to know himself to be much better than his father, and infinitely superior to his grandfather; who is always ready to make a speech on every occasion, and who feels himself to be fit company for a Prime Minister as soon as he has left school. Probably he is. Young Jones was not so; and it was on account of this deficiency that Rachel prized him. \"I\u0027m not like a young girl myself,\" she had said to her father, \"but I do love a jolly nice boy. With us at sixteen, they are all but decrepit old men, and yet they are such little monkeys.\" \n \n \"For a little monkey, what do you think of yourself?\" her father had replied. But the conversation then had not gone any further. \n \n \"I know you\u0027ll be after me before long,\" Rachel said to Frank, as they walked up and down the platform together. \n \n \"If I do, I shall ask you to marry me at once,\" he replied. \n \n \"I shall never do that without your father\u0027s leave.\" \n \n \"Is that the way they manage things in America?\" \n \n \"It\u0027s the way I shall manage them here,\" said Rachel. \"I\u0027m in the unfortunate position of having three papas to whom I must attend. There is papa O\u0027Mahony—\" \n \n \"You will never be incommoded much by him,\" he replied. \n \n \"He is the least potent of the three, no doubt. Then there is papa Jones. He is absolutely omnipotent in this matter. He would not let me come down to Castle Morony for fear I should contaminate you all. I obeyed without even daring to feel the slightest snub, and if I were married to-morrow, I should kiss his toe in token of respect, and with a great deal more affection than I should kiss your half-bearded lips, sir.\" Here Frank got a hold of her hand beneath his arm, and gave it a squeeze. \"He is the real old-fashioned father in the play, who is expected to come out at last with a hundred thousand dollars and his blessing.\" \n \n \"And who is the third papa?\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t you know? Mahomet M. Moss. He is the third papa—if only he would consent to remain in that comparatively humble position.\" Here Frank listened to her words with sharp ears, but he said nothing at the moment. \"Mahomet M. Moss is at any rate my lord and master for the present.\" \n \n \"Not whilst I am alive,\" said Frank. \n \n \"But he is. There is no use in rebelling. You are not my lord and master until you have gone through a certain ceremony. I wish you were. Will that satisfy you?\" \n \n \"There is something in the name of lord and master which a girl shouldn\u0027t apply to anyone but to him who is to be her husband.\" \n \n \"Fiddlestick! Mr. Lord and Master that is to be, but is not as yet. But he is, in many respects. I don\u0027t think, Frank, you can imagine the horror I feel in reference to that vilest of human beings. I shall carry a dagger with me, in order to have it ready for any occasion.\" \n \n \"What does he do? You shall not go to be subjected to such danger and such annoyance.\" \n \n She turned round, and looked up into his face as with derision. \"The annoyance no doubt will be mine, Frank, and must be endured; the danger will be his, I think. Nor shall I use the dagger that I spoke of. I can look at him, and I can make him hear my voice, in spite of the smallness of my stature. But there is no one in this world whom I detest as I do that greasy Jew. It is not for what he does, but that I simply detest him. He makes love to me.\" \n \n \"What!\" \n \n \"Oh! he does. You needn\u0027t look like that. You needn\u0027t be a bit jealous.\" \n \n \"I shall come over at once.\" \n \n \"And knock him on the head! You had better not do that, because we want to make some money by his means. As a lover I can keep him at a distance. I wish I could do so to you, Mr. Jones.\" \n \n \"Why do you wish to keep me at a distance?\" \n \n \"Because you know how to be troublesome. It is much harder to keep a lover at a distance when you really love him with all your heart\"—here she looked up into his face and squeezed his arm, and nearly made him mad for the moment—\"than a beast like that, who is no better than a toad to you. There, do you see that ugly old man there?\" She pointed to a cross-looking old gentleman of sixty, who was scolding a porter violently. \"Why aren\u0027t you jealous of that man?\" \n \n \"You never saw him before.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s just the reason. He may be worth my affection, but I know that that Mahomet M. M. is not. You begin with the most bitter hatred on my part. I don\u0027t hate that old gentleman. I rather like him on the whole, though he was so cross. At any rate he\u0027s not a greasy Jew. Papa says that hating Jews is a prejudice. Loving you is a prejudice, I suppose.\" \n \n \"My darling!\" \n \n \"You can\u0027t suppose you are the best man I ever saw, can you?\" \n \n \"It\u0027s a sort of thing we are not to reason about.\" \n \n \"Then it\u0027s a prejudice. I\u0027m prejudiced against Mahomet M. M. I\u0027m equally prejudiced in favour of Mr. Jones, junior, of Ballintubber. It\u0027s horrible to be troubled by the one.\" \n \n \"Well!\" \n \n \"Well! There\u0027s nothing more coming, Mr. Jones. Only don\u0027t you come over in any of your fits of jealousy, or you\u0027ll have to be sent back again. You\u0027re not my lord and master—yet.\" \n \n \"I wish I were.\" \n \n \"So do I. What more do you want than that? I don\u0027t believe there\u0027s another girl in New York would say as much to you,—nor yet in County Galway.\" \n \n \"But what does he say to you?\" \n \n \"Well; just the kind of things that you never say. And he certainly never does the kind of things which you do; and that, Mr. Jones, is an improvement. But papa is in a hurry, and I shouldn\u0027t wonder if the train didn\u0027t go on in a quarter of an hour. I\u0027ll write to you about Mahomet M. M.; and if I behave very badly, such as prodding him with the dagger, or something of that sort, then I will let you know the details. You can\u0027t do it here, so you may as well go.\" So saying, she jumped into the carriage, and the train had started before Frank Jones had begun to think whether he could do it there or no. \n \n \"He\u0027s a good fellow, take him all round,\" said Mr. O\u0027Mahony, when the carriages had left the station. \n \n \"As good as the rest of them.\" \n \n \"I think he is better.\" \n \n \"Of course we all think so of our own. Why should he be better than any other young lady\u0027s Mr. Jones? I don\u0027t suppose he is better; but we\u0027ll endeavour to believe that he is up to the average.\" \n \n \"Is that all that you\u0027ve got to say for him, Rachel?\" \n \n \"What! To you? Not exactly—if I am to speak the solid truth; which I don\u0027t see why I should have to do, even to my own father. I do think him above the average. I think him so much above the average as to be the best of all. But why? Simply because I believe him when he says he wants to marry me, and make me his companion for life. And then there\u0027s an affinity between us which God certainly manages. Why should I trust him in every detail of life with a perfect faith, and not trust Mr. Mahomet M. Moss to the extent of half-a-crown? If he were to ask me for everything I have in the world, I should give it to him, without a thought except of his goodness in taking care of it for me. I wouldn\u0027t let Mahomet M. Moss have a dollar of mine without giving me his bond. Papa, there will be a row between me and Mr. Mahomet M. Moss, and so it\u0027s well to put you on your guard.\" \n \n \"What sort of a row, my dear?\" \n \n \"A very rowy row. I don\u0027t mean about dollars, for you\u0027ll have to manage that just at first. When we have got into the running, I think I shall have something to say on that subject too.\" \n \n \"What row do you mean?\" \n \n \"He\u0027ll misbehave himself. He always does, more or less.\" \n \n \"The poor fellow can\u0027t open his mouth without your saying that he misbehaves himself.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s quite true; he can\u0027t. He can\u0027t brush his hair, or tie his cravat, or settle his pantaloons, without misbehaving himself. He certainly can\u0027t look out of his eye without gross misbehaviour.\" \n \n \"What is he to do then?\" said Mr. O\u0027Mahony. \"Nature has imbued him with all these peculiarities, and you are fantastic to find fault with him.\" \n \n \"Perhaps so—but then I am fantastic. When you\u0027ve got a dirty coat on, or Frank, I don\u0027t find fault with it; but when he\u0027s got a clean coat, I writhe at him in my disgust. Yet, upon the whole, I like men to have clean coats.\" \n \n \"But you haven\u0027t said how the row is to come.\" \n \n \"Because I don\u0027t know; but it will come. It won\u0027t be about his coat, nor yet his hat, unless he puts it close down under my nose. My time, as I understand, is to be at his disposal.\" \n \n \"There will be an agreement made as to all that.\" \n \n \"An agreement as to my performances. I quite understand that I must be present at fixed times at the theatre, and that he must fix them. That will not worry me; particularly if you will go to the theatre with me.\" \n \n \"Of course I will do that when you want it.\" \n \n \"But he is to come to me with his beastly lessons. Am I to have no relief from that?\" \n \n \"The hours can be fixed.\" \n \n \"But they won\u0027t be fixed. There\u0027s no doubt that he understands his trade. He can make me open my mouth and keep it open. And he can tell me when I sing false or flat. Providence when she gave him that horrid head of hair, did give him also the peculiarity of a fine ear. I think it is the meanest thing out for a man to be proud of that. If you can run a straight furrow with a plough it is quite as great a gift.\" \n \n \"That is nonsense, my dear. Such an ear as Mr. Moss\u0027s is very rare.\" \n \n \"A man who can see exactly across an entire field is just as rare. I don\u0027t see the difference. Nor when a woman sings do I respect her especially because of her voice. When a man can write a poem like Homer, or rule a country like Washington, there is something to say for him. I shall tell him that I will devote one hour a day to practising, and no more.\" \n \n \"That will settle the difficulty; if it be enough.\" \n \n \"But during that hour, there is to be no word spoken except what has to do with the lessons. You\u0027ll bear me out in that?\" \n \n \"There must be some give and take in regard to ordinary conversation.\" \n \n \"You don\u0027t know what a beast he is, papa. What am I to do if he tells me to my face that I\u0027m a beautiful young woman?\" \n \n \"Tell him that you are quite aware of the fact, but that it is a matter you do not care to talk about.\" \n \n \"And then he\u0027ll simper. You do not know what a vile creature he can be. I can take care of myself. You needn\u0027t be a bit afraid about that. I fancy I could give him a slap on the face which would startle him a little. And if we came to blows, I do believe that he would not have a leg to stand upon. He is nearly fifty.\" \n \n \"My dear!\" \n \n \"Say forty. But I do believe a good shove would knock him off his nasty little legs. I used to think he wore a wig; but no hairdresser could be such a disgrace to his profession to let such a wig as that go out of his shop.\" \n \n \"I always regarded him as a good-looking young man,\" said Mr. O\u0027Mahony. Here Rachel shook her head, and made a terrible grimace. \"It\u0027s all fancy you know,\" continued he. \n \n \"I suppose it is. But if you hear that I have told him that I regard him as a disgusting monkey, you must not be surprised.\" This was the last conversation which Mr. O\u0027Mahony and his daughter had respecting Mahomet M. Moss, till they reached London. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2744/75544.html","bookId":1377,"book":{"id":1377,"title":"The Landleaguers","description":"简介： In the year 1850 the two estates of Ballintubber and Morony were sold to Mr. Philip Jones, under the Estates Court, which had then been established.
