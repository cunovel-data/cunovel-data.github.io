{"id":11410,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V. MR. O\u0027MAHONY AND HIS DAUGHTER.","content":"We must now turn to another personage in our story, and tell our readers something of the adventures and conditions of this gentleman;—something also of his daughter. The adventures of her early life will occupy much of our time and many of our pages; and though her father may not be so interesting as it is hoped that she will become, still he was so peculiar in his modes of thought, and so honest, though by no means wise, in his manner of thinking, as to make his story also perhaps worth the telling. \n \n Gerald O\u0027Mahony was at the time of the flooding of Mr. Jones\u0027s meadows not much more than forty years old. But he was already the father of a daughter nearly twenty. Where he was born, from what parents, or to what portion of Ireland his family belonged, no one knew. He himself had been heard to declare a suspicion that his father had come from County Kerry. But as he himself had been, according to his own statement, probably born in the United States, the county to which his father had belonged is not important. He had been bred up as a Roman Catholic, but had long since thrown over all the prejudices of his religion. He had married when he was quite young, and had soon lost his wife. But in talking of her now he always described her as an angel. But though he looked to be so young as to be his daughter\u0027s brother, rather than her father, he had never thought of marrying again. His daughter he declared was everything to him. But those who knew him well said that politics were dearer to him even than his daughter. Since he had been known in County Galway, he had passed and repassed nearly a dozen times between New York and Ireland; and his daughter had twice come with him. He had no declared means, but he had never been known to borrow a shilling, or to leave a bill unpaid. But he had frequently said aloud that he had no money left, and that unless he returned to his own country he and his daughter must be taken in by some poor-house. For Mr. O\u0027Mahony, fond as he was of Ireland, allowed no one to say that he was an Irishman. \n \n But his troubles were apparently no troubles to him. He was always good-humoured, and seemed always to be happy—except when in public, when he was engaged upon politics. Then he would work himself up to such a state of indignant anger as seemed to be altogether antagonistic to good-humour. The position he filled,—or had filled,—was that of lecturer on behalf of the United States. He had lectured at Manchester, at Glasgow, at Liverpool, and lately all over Ireland. But he had risen to such a height of wrath in advocating the doctrine of Republicanism that he had been stopped by the police. He had been held to have said things disrespectful of the Queen. This he loudly denied. He had always, he said, spoken of the Queen\u0027s virtues, her graces, and general fitness for her high office. He had declared,—and this was true,—that of all kings and queens of whom he had read in history she was the best. But, he had gone on to say there should be no king or queen. The practice was an absurdity. The reverence paid even to the high office was such as, in his idea, degraded a man. Even in America, the Kotooing which took place before the President\u0027s toe was to him an abomination. No man in accordance with his theory should worship another man. Titles should only be used as indicative of a man\u0027s trade or occupation. As one man was Mr. General Grant, another man should be Mr. Bricklayer Green. He could not do away with the Queen. But for the woman, he was quite disposed to worship her. All women were to be worshipped, and it was a privilege of a man to worship a woman. When a woman possessed so many virtues as did the Queen of England, it became a man\u0027s duty to worship them. But it was a woman whom he would worship, and not the Queen. This was carried to such a length, and he was so eloquent on the subject that the police were desired to interfere, and he was made to hold his tongue,—at any rate as far as England and Ireland were concerned. \n \n He had made Galway a kind of centre home, attracted thither by the friendship which his daughter had made with Ada and Edith Jones. For though Ada and Edith were by no means Republican in their thoughts and feelings, it had come to pass that they dearly loved the American girl who was so. Rachel O\u0027Mahony had frequently been at Morony Castle, as had also her father; and Mr. Jones had taken delight in controverting the arguments of the American, because, as he had said, the American had been unselfish and true. But since his lecturing had been stopped, it had become necessary that he should go elsewhere to look for means of livelihood, and he had now betaken himself to London for that purpose,—a circumstance which will be explained at greater length as the story progresses. \n \n Republicanism was not the only matter in his political creed to which Gerald O\u0027Mahony was devoted. Though he was no Irishman, as he delighted to intimate, his heart was Irish; and during his various visits to the country, he had filled his bosom with thoughts of Irish wrongs. No educated man was ever born and bred in more utter ignorance of all political truths than this amiable and philanthropic gentleman. In regard to Ireland his theory was that the land should be taken from the present proprietors, and divided among the peasants who tilled it. When asked what should be done with the present owners, he was quite ready with his answer: \"Let them be paid for the property by the State!\" He would have no man injured to the extent of a shilling. When asked where the State was to get the money, he declared that that was a mere detail. States did get money. As for the landlords themselves, with the money in their pockets, let them emigrate to the United States, if they were in want of something to do. As to the division of the land,—that he said would settle itself. One man would have ten acres, and another fifty; but that would be fair, because one man had been used to pay for ten, and another to pay for fifty. As for the men who got no land in the scramble he could see no injustice. The man who chanced to have been a tenant for the last twelve months, must take the benefit of his position. No doubt such man could sell his land immediately after he got it, because Freedom of Sale was one of the points of his charter. He could see the injustice of giving the land at a rent fixed by the State, because the State has no right to interfere in ordinary contracts between man and man. But if the land was to be given up without any rent, then he could see no injustice. Thus, and thus only, could Ireland be made to return to the beauty and the grace of her original simplicity. \n \n But on the wrongs arising from the want of Home Rule he was warmer even than on those which the land question had produced. \"Why should Ireland be governed by a British Parliament, a British Lord-Lieutenant, a British Chief-Secretary, a British Commander-in-Chief, and trodden under foot by a British soldiery? Why should Scotland be so governed, why should Wales, why should Yorkshire?\" Mr. Jones would reply, \"Repeal the unions; restore the Heptarchy!\" Mr. O\u0027Mahony had but a confused idea of what the Heptarchy had been. But he was sure that it would be for the benefit of Ireland, that Irish knives should be made of Irish steel. \"As undoubtedly would have been the case if the question of protection were to be left to an Irish Parliament to settle,\" said Mr. Jones. \"Heaven help the man who would want to cut his mutton. His best chance would be that he would soon have no mutton to cut.\" \n \n So the dispute was carried on with much warmth on one side, and with many arguments on the other, but without any quarrelling. It was impossible to quarrel with O\u0027Mahony, who was thoroughly unselfish, and desirous of no violence. When he had heard what had been done in reference to Mr. Jones\u0027s meadows, and had been told of the suspected conduct of Pat Carroll, he was as indignant as though he had himself been a landed proprietor, or even an Orangeman. And on Mr. Jones\u0027s part there was a desire to do justice to all around him, which came within the capacity of O\u0027Mahony\u0027s vision. He knew that Mr. Jones himself was a fair-dealing, honest gentleman, and he could not, therefore, quarrel with him. \n \n There is a steamer running from the town of Galway, across Lough Corrib, to the little village of Cong, on the Mayo side of the lake, which stops and picks up passengers within a mile of Morony Castle. From this, passengers are landed, so that the means of transit between Galway and Mr. Jones\u0027s house are peculiarly easy. Up and down by this steamer Ada and Edith Jones had frequently gone to visit their friend, and as frequently that friend had come to visit them. But unfortunately the steamer had been open to others besides the young ladies, and Rachel O\u0027Mahony had found a dearer friend than either of the girls at Morony Castle. It had come to pass that Frank Jones and Rachel O\u0027Mahony had declared themselves to be engaged. On no such ground as want of wealth, or want of family, or want of education, had Mr. Jones based his objection to the match; but there had been a peculiarity in the position of Rachel which had made him hesitate. It was not that she was an American, but such an American! It was not that he was a Republican, but such a Republican! And she was more anxious to carry Frank away with her to the United States, and to join him in a political partnership with her father, than to come and settle herself down at the Castle. Thus there had arisen an understanding on the part of the young people, that, though they were engaged, they were engaged without the consent of the young man\u0027s father. Rachel therefore was not to be brought to the Castle while Frank was there. To all this Rachel\u0027s father had assented, in a smiling indifferent manner, half intended to ridicule all who were concerned. As it was not a question of politics, Mr. O\u0027Mahony could not work himself up to any anger, or apparently even to anxiety in the matter. \"Your young people,\"—here he meant English and Irish generally,—\"are taught to think they should begin the world where we leave it off.\" \n \n \"Your young people are just as fond of what money will buy as are ours,\" said Mr. Jones. \n \n \"But they are fonder of one another, even, than of money. When they love one another they become engaged. Then they marry. And as a rule they don\u0027t starve. As a rule people with us seldom do starve. As for making out an income for a young man to start with, that with us is quite out of the question. Frank some day will have this property.\" \n \n \"That won\u0027t give him much of an income,\" said Mr. Jones, who since the affair of the flood had become very despondent in reference to the estate. \n \n \"Then he\u0027s as well off now as ever he will be, and might as well marry the girl.\" But all this was said with no eagerness. \n \n \"They are merely boy and girl as yet,\" said Mr. Jones. \n \n \"I was married, and Rachel was born before I was Frank\u0027s age.\" So saying, Mr. O\u0027Mahony consented to come to Morony Castle, and bid them adieu, without bringing his girl with him. This was hard upon Ada and Edith, as Mr. Frank, of course, went into Galway as often as he pleased, and made his adieu after his own fashion. \n \n And there had come up another cause which had created further objections to the marriage in Mr. Jones\u0027s mind. Mr. O\u0027Mahony had declared that as his lecturing was brought to an end by the police, he must throw himself upon Rachel\u0027s capabilities for earning some money. Rachel\u0027s capabilities had been often discussed at the Castle, but with various feelings on the three sides into which the party had formed themselves. All the Jones\u0027s were on one side, and declared that the capability had better not be exercised. In this they were probably wrong;—but it was their opinion. They had lived for many years away from London. The children had so lived all their lives; and they conceived that prejudices still existed which had now been banished or nearly banished from the world. Mr. O\u0027Mahony, who formed another party, thought that the matter was one of supreme indifference. As long as he could earn money by lecturing it was well that he should earn it. It was always better that the men of a family should work than the women; but, if the man\u0027s talent was of no use, then it might be well to fall back upon the woman. He only laughed at the existence of a prejudice in the matter. He himself had no prejudices. He regarded all prejudices as the triumph of folly over education. \n \n But Rachel, who was the third party in the discussion, had a very strong feeling of her own. She was of opinion that if the capability in question existed, it ought to be exercised. On that subject,—her possession of the capability,—she entertained, she said, strong doubts. But if the capability existed it certainly ought to be used. That was Rachel\u0027s opinion, expressed with all the vigour which she knew how to throw into the subject. \n \n This capability had already been exercised in New York, where it had been efficacious, though the effect had not been great. She had been brought up to sing, and great things had been promised of her voice. An American manager had thought much of her performance, though she had hitherto, he said, been young, and had not come to the strength of her throat. But he had himself seen to her education, almost as a child, and had been sure that sooner or later she would do great things in the musical world. Mr. Mahomet M. Moss was the gentleman in question, and he at present was in London. That such a voice as Rachel O\u0027Mahony\u0027s should be lost to the world, was to his thinking a profanity, an indecency, an iniquity, a wasting of God\u0027s choicest gifts, and an abomination not to be thought of; for Mr. Mahomet M. Moss was in the affairs of his own profession a most energetic gentleman. Rachel rather turned up her nose at Mr. Mahomet M. Moss; but she was very anxious to go to London and to take her chance, and to do something, as she said, laughing, just to keep her father\u0027s pot a little on the boil;—but for Mr. Mahomet M. Moss she did not care one straw. Mr. O\u0027Mahony was therefore ready to start on the journey, and had now come to Morony Castle to say farewell to his friend Mr. Jones. \"Are you sure about that fellow Moss?\" said Mr. Jones. \n \n \"What do you call sure about him? He\u0027s as big a swindler, I guess, as you shall find from here to himself.\" \n \n \"And are you going to put Rachel into his hands?\" \n \n \"Well, I think so;—after a sort of fashion. He\u0027ll swindle her out of three parts of what she earns;—but she\u0027ll get the fourth part. It\u0027s always the way with a young girl when she\u0027s first brought out.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t mean about money. Will you leave her conduct in his hands?\" \n \n \"He\u0027ll be a clever chap who\u0027ll undertake to look after Rachel\u0027s conduct. I guess she\u0027ll conduct herself mostly.\" \n \n \"You\u0027ll be there to be sure,\" said Mr. Jones. \n \n \"Yes, I shall be there; and she\u0027ll conduct me too. Very likely.\" \n \n \"But, Mr. O\u0027Mahony,—as a father!\" \n \n \"I know pretty well what you would be saying. Our young folk grow old quicker a long sight than yours do. Now your girls here are as sweet as primroses out of the wood. But Rachel is like a rose that has been brought up to stand firm on its own bush. I\u0027m not a bit afraid of her. Nor yet is your son. She looks as though you might blow her away with the breath from your mouth. You try her, and you\u0027ll find that she\u0027ll want a deal of blowing.\" \n \n \"Does not a young girl lose something of the aroma of her youth by seeing too much of the world too soon?\" \n \n \"How old do you expect her to be when she\u0027s to die?\" \n \n \"Rachel! How can I tell? She is only as yet entering upon life, and her health seems to be quite confirmed.\" \n \n \"The best confirmed I ever knew in my life. She never has a day\u0027s illness. Taking all the chances one way and another, shall we say sixty?\" \n \n \"More than that, I should think,\" said Mr. Jones. \n \n \"Say sixty. She may fall down a trap in the theatre, or be drowned in one of your Cunarders.\" \n \n \"The Cunard steamers never drown anybody,\" said Mr. Jones. \n \n \"Well, then, a White Star—or any cockle-shell you may please to name. We\u0027ll put her down for sixty as an average.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know what you are driving at,\" said Mr. Jones. \n \n \"She has lived a third of her life already, and you expect her to know nothing, so that the aroma may still cling to her. Aroma does very well for earls\u0027 daughters and young marchionesses, though as far as I can learn, it\u0027s going out of fashion with them. What has an American girl to do with aroma, who\u0027s got her bread to earn? She\u0027s got to look to her conduct, and to be sharp at the same time. Mr. Mahomet M. Moss will rob her of seventy-five cents out of every dollar for the next twelve months. In three years\u0027 time he\u0027ll rob her of nothing. Only that she knows what conduct means, he\u0027d have to look very sharp to keep his own.\" \n \n \"It is not natural,\" said Mr. Jones. \n \n \"But it\u0027s American. Marvels are not natural, and we are marvellous people. I don\u0027t know much about aroma, but I think you\u0027ll find Rachel will come out of the washing without losing much colour in the process.\" \n \n Then the two friends parted, and Mr. O\u0027Mahony went back to Galway, preparatory to his journey to London. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2744/75543.html","bookId":1377,"book":{"id":1377,"title":"The Landleaguers","description":"简介： In the year 1850 the two estates of Ballintubber and Morony were sold to Mr. Philip Jones, under the Estates Court, which had then been established.
