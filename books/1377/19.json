{"id":11424,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XIX. FIFTH AVENUE AND NEWPORT.","content":"\"What about Madame Socani?\" Rachel, as she said this, abandoned for the moment her look against the wall, and shook herself instantly free of all her dowdiness. She flashed fire at him from her eyes, and jumping up from her seat, took hold of her father by his shoulder. He encircled her waist with his arm, but otherwise sat silent, looking Mr. Moss full in the face. It must be acknowledged on the part of Rachel that she was prepared to make her accusation against Mr. Moss on perhaps insufficient grounds. She had heard among the people at the theatre, who did not pretend to know much of Mr. Moss and his antecedents, that there was a belief that Madame Socani was his wife. There was something in this which offended her more grossly than ever,—and a wickedness which horrified her. But she certainly knew nothing about it; and Madame Socani\u0027s proposition to herself had come to her from Madame Socani, and not from Mr. Moss. All she knew of Madame Socani was that she had been on the boards in New York, and had there made for herself a reputation. Rachel had on one occasion sung with her, but it had been when she was little more than a child. \"What is Madame Socani to me?\" said Mr. Moss. \"I believe her to be your wife.\" \"Oh, heavens! My wife! I never had a wife, Miss O\u0027Mahony;—not yet! Why do you say things so cruel to me?\" He, at any rate, she was sure, had sent her that message. She thought that she was sure of his villainous misconduct to her in that respect. She believed that she did know him to be a devil, whether he was a married man or not. \"What message did you send to me by Madame Socani?\" \"What message? None!\" and again he laid his hand upon his waistcoat. \"He asked me to be—\" But she could not tell her father of what nature was the message. \"Father, he is a reptile. If you knew all, you would be unable to keep your hands from his throat. And now he dares to come here and talk to me of his affection. You had better bid him leave the room and have done with him.\" \"You hear what my daughter says, Mr. Moss.\" \"Yes, I hear her,\" answered the poor innocent-looking tenor. \"But what does she mean? Why is she so fierce?\" \"He knows, father,\" said Rachel. \"Have nothing further to say to him.\" \"I don\u0027t think that I do quite know,\" said Mr. O\u0027Mahony. \"But you can see, at any rate, Mr. Moss, that she does not return your feeling.\" \"I would make her my wife to-morrow,\" said Mr. Moss, slapping his waistcoat once more. \"And do you, as the young lady\u0027s papa, think of what we two might do together. I know myself, I know my power. Madame Socani is a jealous woman. She would wish to be taken into partnership with me,—not a partnership of hearts, but of theatres. She has come with some insolent message, but not from me;—ah, not from me!\" \"You never tried to kiss me? You did not make two attempts?\" \"I would make two thousand if I were to consult my own heart.\" \"When you knew that I was engaged to Mr. Jones!\" \"What was Mr. Jones to me? Now I ask your respectable parent, is Miss Rachel unreasonable? When a gentleman has lost his heart in true love, is he to be reproached because he endeavours to seize one little kiss? Did not Mr. Jones do the same?\" \"Bother Mr. Jones!\" said Rachel, overcome by the absurdity of the occasion. \"As you observed just now, Mr. Jones and I are two. Things have not turned out happily, though I am not obliged to explain all that to you. But Mr. Jones is to me all that a man should be; you, Mr. Moss, are not. Now, father, had he not better go?\" \"I don\u0027t think any good is to be done, I really don\u0027t,\" said Mr. O\u0027Mahony. \"Why am I to be treated in this way?\" \"Because you come here persevering when you know it\u0027s no good.\" \"I think of what you and I might do together with Moss\u0027s theatre between us.\" \"Oh, heavens!\" \"You should be called the O\u0027Mahony. Your respectable papa should keep an eye to your pecuniary interest.\" \"I could keep an eye myself for that.\" \"You would be my own wife, of course—my own wife.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t be anything of the kind.\" \"Ah, but listen!\" continued Mr. Moss. \"You do not know how the profits run away into the pockets of impresarios and lessees and money-lenders. We should have it all ourselves. I have ￡30,000 of my own, and my respectable parent in New York has as much more. It would all be the same as ours. Only think! Before long we would have a house on the Fifth Avenue so furnished that all the world should wonder; and another at Newport, where the world should not be admitted to wonder. Only think!\" \"And Madame Socani to look after the furniture!\" said Rachel. \"Madame Socani should be nowheres.\" \"And I also will be nowheres. Pray remember that in making all your little domestic plans. If you live in the Fifth Avenue, I will live in 350 Street; or perhaps I should like it better to have a little house here in Albert Place. Father, don\u0027t you think Mr. Moss might go away?\" \"I think you have said all that there is to be said.\" Then Mr. O\u0027Mahony got up from his chair as though to show Mr. Moss out of the room. \"Not quite, Mr. O\u0027Mahony. Allow me for one moment. As the young lady\u0027s papa you are bound to look to these things. Though the theatre would be a joint affair, Miss O\u0027Mahony would have her fixed salary;—that is to say, Mrs. Moss would.\" \"I won\u0027t stand it,\" said Rachel getting up. \"I won\u0027t allow any man to call me by so abominable a name,—or any woman.\" Then she bounced out of the room. \"It\u0027s no good, you see,\" said Mr. O\u0027Mahony. \"I by no means see that so certain. Of course a young lady like your daughter knows her own value, and does not yield all at once.\" \"I tell you it\u0027s no good. I know my own daughter.\" \"Excuse me, Mr. O\u0027Mahony, but I doubt whether you know the sex.\" The two men were very nearly of an age; but O\u0027Mahony assumed the manners of an old man, and Mr. Moss of a young one. \"Perhaps not,\" said Mr. O\u0027Mahony. \"They have been my study up from my cradle,\" said Mr. Moss. \"No doubt.\" \"And I think that I have carried on the battle not without some little éclat.\" \"I am quite sure of it.\" \"I still hope that I may succeed with your sweet daughter.\" \"Here the battle is of a different kind,\" not without a touch of satire in the tone of his voice, whatever there might be in the words which he used. \"In tournaments of love, you have, I do not doubt, been very successful; but here, it seems to me that the struggle is for money.\" \"That is only an accident.\" \"But the accident rises above everything. It does not matter in the least which comes first. Whether it be for love or money my daughter will certainly have a will of her own. You may take my word that she is not to be talked out of her mind.\" \"But Mr. Jones is gone?\" asked Moss. \"But she is not on that account ready to transfer her affections at a moment\u0027s notice. To her view of the matter there seems to be something a little indelicate in the idea.\" \"Bah!\" said Mr. Moss. \"You cannot make her change her mind by saying bah.\" \"Professional interests have to be considered,\" said Mr. Moss. \"No doubt; my daughter does consider her professional interests every day when she practises for two hours.\" \"That is excellent,—and with such glorious effects! She has only now got the full use of her voice. My G——! what could she not do if she had the full run of Moss\u0027s Theatre! She might choose whatever operas would suit her best; and she would have me to guide her judgment! I do know my profession, Mr. O\u0027Mahony. A lady in her line should always marry a gentleman in mine; that is if she cares about matrimony.\" \"Of course she did intend to be married to Mr. Jones.\" \"Oh! Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones! I am sick of Mr. Jones. What could Mr. Jones do? He is only a poor ruined Irishman. You must feel that Mr. Jones was only in the way. I am offering her all that professional experience and capital can do. What are her allurements?\" \"I don\u0027t in the least know, Mr. Moss.\" \"Only her beauty.\" \"I thought, perhaps it was her singing.\" \"That joined,\" said Mr. Moss. \"No doubt her voice and her beauty joined together. Madame Socani\u0027s voice is as valuable,—almost as valuable.\" \"I would marry Madame Socani if I were you.\" \"No! Madame Socani is,—well a leetle past her prime. Madame Socani and I have known each other for twenty years. Madame Socani is aware that I am attached to your daughter. Well; I do not mind telling you the truth. Madame Socani and I have been on very intimate terms. I did offer once to make Madame Socani my wife. She did not see her way in money matters. She was making an income greater than mine. Things have changed since that. Madame Socani is very well, but she is a jealous woman. Madame Socani hates your daughter. Oh, heavens, yes! But she was never my wife. Oh, no! A woman at this profession grows old quicker than a man. And she has never succeeded in getting a theatre of her own. She did try her hand at it at New York, but that came to nothing. If Miss Rachel will venture along with me, we will have 500,000 dollars before five years are gone. She shall have everything that the world can offer—jewels, furniture, hangings! She shall keep the best table in New York, and shall have her own banker\u0027s account. There\u0027s no such success to be found anywhere for a young woman. If you will only just turn it in your mind, Mr. O\u0027Mahony.\" Then Mr. Moss brushed his hat with the sleeve of his coat and took his leave. He had nearly told the entire truth to Mr. O\u0027Mahony. He had never married Madame Socani. As far as Madame Socani knew, her veritable husband, Socani, was still alive. And it was not true that Mr. Moss had sent that abominable message to Rachel. The message, no doubt, had expressed a former wish on his part; but that wish was now in abeyance. Miss O\u0027Mahony\u0027s voice had proved itself to him to be worth matrimony,—that and her beauty together. In former days, when he had tried to kiss her, he had valued her less highly. Now, as he left the room, he was fully content with the bargain he had suggested. Mr. Jones was out of the way, and her voice had proved itself to his judgment to be worth the price he had offered. When her father saw her again he began meekly to plead for Mr. Moss. \"Do you mean to say, father,\" she exclaimed, \"that you have joined yourself to him?\" \"I am only telling you what he says.\" \"Tell me nothing at all. You ought to know that he is an abomination. Though he had the whole Fifth Avenue to offer to me I would not touch him with a pair of tongs.\" But she, in the midst of her singing, had been much touched by seeing Frank Jones among the listeners in the back of one of the boxes. When the piece was over there had come upon her a desire to go to him and tell him that, in spite of all she had said, she would wait for him if only he would profess himself ready to wait for her. There was not much in it,—that a man should wait in town for two or three days, and should return to the theatre to see the girl whom he professed to regard. It was only that, but it had again stirred her love. She had endeavoured to send to him when the piece was over; but he was gone, and she saw him no more.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2744/75557.html","bookId":1377,"book":{"id":1377,"title":"The Landleaguers","description":"简介： In the year 1850 the two estates of Ballintubber and Morony were sold to Mr. Philip Jones, under the Estates Court, which had then been established.
