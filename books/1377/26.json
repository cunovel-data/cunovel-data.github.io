{"id":11431,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER XXVI. LORD CASTLEWELL.","content":"The spring and early summer had worn themselves away in London, and Rachel O\u0027Mahony was still singing at the Embankment Theatre. She and her father were still living in Cecil Street. The glorious day of October, which had been fixed at last for the 24th, on which Rachel was to appear on the Covent Garden boards, was yet still distant, and she was performing under Mr. Moss\u0027s behests at a weekly stipend of ￡15, to which there would be some addition when the last weeks of the season had come about, the end of July and beginning of August. But, alas! Rachel hardly knew what she would do to support herself during the dead months from August to October. \"Fashionable people always go out of town, father,\" she said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then let us be fashionable.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Fashionable people go to Scotland, but they won\u0027t take one in there without money. We shan\u0027t have ￡50 left when our debts are paid. And ￡50 would do nothing for us.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They\u0027ve stopped me altogether,\" said Mr. O\u0027Mahony. \"At any rate they have stopped the money-making part of the business. They have threatened to take the man\u0027s license away, and therefore that place is shut up.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t that unjust, father?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Unjust! Everything done in England as to Ireland is unjust. They carried an Act of Parliament the other day, when in accordance with the ancient privileges of members it was within the power of a dozen stalwart Irishmen to stop it. The dozen stalwart Irishmen were there, but they were silenced by a brutal majority. The dozen Irishmen were turned out of the House, one after the other, in direct opposition to the ancient privileges; and so a Bill was passed robbing five million Irishmen of their liberties. So gross an injustice was never before perpetrated—not even when the bribed members sold their country and effected the accursed union.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know that was very bad, father, but the bribes were taken by Irishmen. Be that as it may, what are we to do with ourselves next autumn?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The only thing for us is to seek for assistance in the United States.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They won\u0027t lend us ￡100.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We must overrun this country by the force of true liberal opinion. The people themselves will rise when they have the Americans to lead them. What is wanted now are the voices of true patriots loud enough to reach the people.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And ￡100,\" said she, speaking into his ear, \"to keep us alive from the middle of August to the end of October.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"For myself, I have been invited to come into Parliament. The County of Cavan will be vacant.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is there a salary attached?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"One or two leading Irish members are speaking of it,\" said Mr. O\u0027Mahony, carried away by the grandeur of the idea, \"but the amount has not been fixed yet. And they seem to think that it is wanted chiefly for the parliamentary session. I have not promised because I do not quite see my way. And to tell the truth, I am not sure that it is in Parliament that an honest Irishman will shine the best. What\u0027s the good when you can be silenced at a moment\u0027s notice by the word of some mock Speaker, who upsets all the rules of his office to put a gag upon a dozen men. When America has come to understand what it is that the lawless tyrant did on that night when the Irishmen were turned out of the House, will she not rise in her wrath, and declare that such things shall no longer be?\" All this occurred in Cecil Street, and Rachel, who well understood her father\u0027s wrath, allowed him to expend in words the anger which would last hardly longer than the sound of them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But you won\u0027t be in Parliament for County Cavan before next August?\" she asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose not.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nor will the United States have risen in their wrath so as to have settled the entire question before that time?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps not,\" said Mr. O\u0027Mahony. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And if they did I don\u0027t see what good it would do to us as to finding for us the money that we want.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am so full of Ireland\u0027s wrongs at this moment, and with the manner in which these policemen interfered with me, that I can hardly bring myself to think of your autumn plans.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What are yours?\" she asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose we should always have money enough to go to America. In America a man can at any rate open his mouth.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Or a woman either. But according to what M. Le Gros says, in England they pay better at the present moment. Mr. Moss has offered to lend me the money; but for myself I would sooner go into an English workhouse than accept money from Mr. Moss which I had not earned.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n In truth, Rachel had been very foolish with her money, spending it as though there were no end to the source from which it had come, and her father had not been more prudent. He was utterly reckless in regard to such considerations, and would simply declare that he was altogether indifferent to his dinner, or to the new hat he had proposed to buy for himself when the subject was brought under his notice. He had latterly become more eager than ever as to politics, and was supremely happy as long as he was at liberty to speak before any audience those angry words which had however been, unfortunately for him, declared to be treasonable. He had, till lately, been taught to understand that the House of Commons was the only arena on which such permission would be freely granted,—and could be granted of course only to Members of the House. Therefore the idea had entered his head that it would suit him to become a member,—more especially as there had arisen a grand scheme of a salary for certain Irish members of which he would be one. But even here the brutality of England had at last interfered, and men were not to be allowed to say what they pleased any longer even in the House of Commons. Therefore Mr. O\u0027Mahony was much disturbed; and although he was anxious to quarrel with no one individually, not even the policemen who arrested him, he was full of indignant wrath against the tyranny of England generally. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rachel, when she could get no good advice from her father with regard to her future funds, went back again to her singing. It was necessary, at any rate, that she should carry out her present arrangement with Mr. Moss, and she was sure at least of receiving from him the money which she earned. But, alas! she could not practise the economy which she knew to be necessary. The people at the theatre had talked her into hiring a one-horse open carriage in which she delighted to drive about, and in which, to tell the truth, her father delighted to accompany her. She had thought that she could allow herself this indulgence out of her ￡15 a week. And though she paid for the indulgence monthly, that and their joint living nearly consumed the stipend. And now, as her father\u0027s advice did not get beyond the very doubtful salary which might accrue to him as the future member for the County Cavan, her mind naturally turned itself to other sources. From M. Le Gros, or from M. Le Gros\u0027 employers, she was to receive ￡300 for singing in the two months before Christmas, with an assurance of a greatly increased though hitherto unfixed stipend afterwards. Personally she as yet knew no one connected with her future theatrical home but M. Le Gros. Of M. Le Gros all her thoughts had been favourable. Should she ask M. Le Gros to lend her some small sum of money in advance for the uses of the autumn? Mr. Moss had made to her a fixed proposition on the subject which she had altogether declined. She had declined it with scorn as she was wont to do all favours proffered by Mr. Moss. Mr. Moss had still been gracious, and had smiled, and had ventured to express \"a renewed hope,\" as he called it, that Miss O\u0027Mahony would even yet condescend to look with regard on the sincere affection of her most humble servant. And then he had again expatiated on the immense success in theatrical life which would attend a partnership entered into between the skill and beauty and power of voice of Miss O\u0027Mahony on the one side, and the energy, devotion, and capital of Mr. Moss on the other. \"Psha!\" had been Rachel\u0027s only reply; and so that interview had been brought to an end. But Rachel, when she came to think of M. Le Gros, and the money she was desirous of borrowing, was afflicted by certain qualms. That she should have borrowed from Mr. Moss, considering the length of their acquaintance might not have been unnatural; but of M. Le Gros she knew nothing but his civility. Nor had she any reason for supposing that M. Le Gros had money of his own at his disposal; nor did she know where M. Le Gros lived. She could go to Covent Garden and ask for him there; but that was all. \\n\\n \\n\\n So she dressed herself prettily—neatly, as she called it—and had herself driven to the theatre. There, as chance would have it, she found M. Le Gros standing under the portico with a gentleman whom she represented to herself as an elderly old buck. M. Le Gros saw her and came down into the street at once with his hat in his hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"M. Le Gros,\" said she, \"I want you to do me a great favour, but I have hardly the impudence to ask it. Can you lend me some money this autumn—say ￡100?\" Thereupon M. Le Gros\u0027 face fell, and his cheeks were elongated, and his eyes were very sorrowful. \"Ah, then, I see you can\u0027t,\" she said. \"I will not put you to the pain of saying so. I ought not to have suggested it. My dealings with you have seemed to be so pleasant, and they have not been quite of the same nature down at \u0027The Embankment.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My dear young lady—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not another word; and I beg your pardon most heartily for having given you this moment\u0027s annoyance.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There is one of the lessees there,\" said M. Le Gros, pointing back to the gentleman on the top of the steps, \"who has been to hear you and to look at you this two times—this three times at \u0027The Embankment.\u0027 He do think you will become the grand singer of the age.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who is the judicious gentleman?\" asked Rachel, whispering to M. Le Gros out of the carriage. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He is Lord Castlewell. He is the eldest son of the Marquis of Beaulieu. He have—oh!—lots of money. He was saying—ah! I must not tell you what his lordship was saying of you because it will make you vain.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nothing that any lord can say of me will make me vain,\" said Rachel, chucking up her head. Then his lordship, thinking that he had been kept long enough standing on the top of the theatre steps, lifted his hat and came down to the carriage, the occupant of which he had recognised. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"May I have the extreme honour of introducing Mademoiselle O\u0027Mahony to Lord Castlewell?\" and M. Le Gros again pulled off his hat as he made the introduction. Miss O\u0027Mahony found that she had become Mademoiselle as soon as she had drawn up her carriage at the front door of the genuine Italian Opera. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This is a pleasure indeed,\" said Lord Castlewell. \"I am delighted—more than delighted, to find that my friend Le Gros has engaged the services of Mademoiselle O\u0027Mahony for our theatre.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But our engagement does not commence quite yet, I am sorry to say,\" replied Rachel. Then she prepared herself to be driven away, not caring much for the combination of lord and lessee who stood in the street speaking to her. A lessee should be a lessee, she thought, and a lord a lord. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"May I do myself the honour of waiting upon you some day at \u0027The Embankment,\u0027\" said the lord, again pulling off his hat. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh! certainly,\" said Rachel; \"I should be delighted to see you.\" Then she was driven away, and did not know whether to be angry or not in having given Lord Castlewell so warm a welcome. As a mere stray lord there was no possible reason why he should call upon her; nor for her why she should receive him. Though Frank Jones had been dismissed, and though she felt herself to be free to accept any eligible lover who might present himself, she still felt herself bound on his behalf to keep herself free from all elderly theatrical hangers-on, especially from such men when she heard that they were also lords. But as she was driven away, she took another glance at the lord, and thought that he did not look so old as when she had seen him at a greater distance. \\n\\n \\n\\n But she had failed altogether in her purpose of borrowing money from M. Le Gros. And for his sake she regretted much that the attempt had been made. She had already learned one or two details with reference to M. Le Gros. Though his manners and appearance were so pleasant, he was only a subaltern about the theatre; and he was a subaltern whom this lord and lessee called simply Le Gros. And from the melancholy nature of his face when the application for money was made to him, she had learned that he was both good-natured and impecunious. Of herself, in regard to the money, she thought very little at the present moment. There were still six weeks to run, and Rachel\u0027s nature was such that she could not distress herself six weeks in advance of any misfortune. She was determined that she would not tell her father of her failure. As for him, he would not probably say a word further of their want of money till the time should come. He confined his prudence to keeping a sum in his pocket sufficient to take them back to New York. \\n\\n \\n\\n As the days went on which were to bring her engagement at \"The Embankment\" to an end, Rachel heard a further rumour about herself. Rumours did spring up at \"The Embankment\" to which she paid very little attention. She had heard the same sort of things said as to other ladies at the theatre, and took them all as a matter of course. Had she been asked, she would have attributed them all to Madame Socani; because Madame Socani was the one person whom, next to Mr. Moss, she hated the most. The rumour in this case simply stated that she had already been married to Mr. Jones, and had separated from her husband. \"Why do they care about such a matter as that?\" she said to the female from whom she heard the rumour. \"It can\u0027t matter to me as a singer whether I have five husbands.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But it is so interesting,\" said the female, \"when a lady has a husband and doesn\u0027t own him; or when she owns him and hasn\u0027t really got him; it adds a piquancy to life, especially to theatrical life, which does want these little assistances.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Then one evening Lord Castlewell did call upon her at \"The Embankment.\" Her father was not with her, and she was constrained by the circumstances of the moment to see his lordship alone. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do feel, you know, Miss O\u0027Mahony,\" he said, thus coming back for the moment into everyday life, \"that I am entitled to take an interest in you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your lordship is very kind.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose you never heard of me before?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not a word, my lord. I\u0027m an American girl, and I know very little about English lords.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hope that you may come to know more. My special métier in life brings me among the theatres. I am very fond of music,—and perhaps a little fond of beauty also.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am glad you have the sense, my lord, to put music the first.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know about that. In regard to you I cannot say which predominates.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are at liberty at any rate to talk about the one, as you are bidding for it at your own theatre. As to the other, you will excuse me for saying that it is a matter between me and my friends.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Among whom I trust before long I may be allowed to be counted.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The little dialogue had been carried on with smiles and good humour, and Rachel now did not choose to interfere with them. After all she was only a public singer, and as such was hardly entitled to the full consideration of a gentlewoman. It was thus that she argued with herself. Nevertheless she had uttered her little reprimand and had intended him to take it as such. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are coming to us, you know, after the holidays.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And will bring my voice with me, such as it is.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But not your smiles, you mean to say.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They are sure to come with me, for I am always laughing,—unless I am roused to terrible wrath. I am sure that will not be the case at Covent Garden.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hope not. You will find that you have come among a set who are quite prepared to accept you as a friend.\" Here she made a little curtsy. \"And now I have to offer my sincere apologies for the little proposition I am about to make.\" It immediately occurred to her that M. Le Gros had betrayed her. He was a very civil spoken, affable, kind old man; but he had betrayed her. \"M. Le Gros happened to mention that you were anxious to draw in advance for some portion of the salary coming to you for the next two months.\" M. Le Gros had at any rate betrayed her in the most courteous terms. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, yes; M. Le Gros explained that the proposition was not selon les règles, and it does not matter the least in the world.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"M. Le Gros has explained that? I did not know that M. Le Gros had explained anything.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, then, he looked it,\" said Rachel. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"His looks must be wonderfully expressive. He did not look it to me at all. He simply told me, as one of the managers of the theatre, I was to let you have whatever money you wanted. And he did whisper to me,—may I tell you what he whispered?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose you may. He seems to me to be a very good-natured kind of man.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Poor old Le Gros! A very good-natured man, I should say. He doesn\u0027t carry the house, that\u0027s all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You do that.\" Then she remembered that the man was a lord. \"I ought to have said \u0027my lord,\u0027\" she said; \"but I forgot. I hope you\u0027ll excuse me—my lord.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We are not very particular about that in theatrical matters; or, rather, I am particular with some and not with others. You\u0027ll learn all about it in process of time. M. Le Gros whispered that he thought there was not the pleasantest understanding in the world between you and the people here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, no; there is not,—my lord.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bother the lord,—just now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"With all my heart,\" said Rachel, who could not avoid the little bit of fun which was here implied. \"Not but what the—the people here—would find me any amount of money I chose to ask for. There are people, you see, one does not wish to borrow money from. I take my salary here, but nothing more. The fact is, I have not only taken it, but spent it, and to tell the truth, I have not a shilling to amuse myself with during the dull season. Mr. Moss knows all about it, and has simply asked how much I wanted. \u0027Nothing,\u0027 I replied, \u0027nothing at all; nothing at all.\u0027 And that\u0027s how I am situated.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No debts?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not a dollar. Beyond that I shouldn\u0027t have a dollar left to get out of London with.\" Then she remembered herself,—that it was expedient that she should tell this man something about herself. \"I have got a father, you know, and he has to be paid for as well as me. He is the sweetest, kindest, most generous father that a girl ever had, and he could make lots of money for himself, only the police won\u0027t let him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What do the police do to him?\" said Lord Castlewell. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He is not a burglar, you know, or anything of that kind.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He is an Irish politician, isn\u0027t he?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He is very much of a politician; but he is not an Irishman.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Irish name,\" suggested the lord. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Irish name, yes; so are half the names in my country. My father comes from the United States. And he is strongly impressed with the necessity of putting down the horrid injustice with which the poor Irish are treated by the monstrous tyranny of you English aristocrats. You are very nice to look at.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank you, Miss O\u0027Mahony.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But you are very bad to go. You are not the kind of horses I care to drive at all. Thieves, traitors, murderers, liars.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Goodness gracious me!\" exclaimed the lord. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t say anything for myself, because I am only a singing girl, and understand nothing about politics. But these are the very lightest words which he has at his tongue\u0027s end when he talks about you. He is the most good-tempered fellow in the world, and you would like him very much. Here is Mr. Moss.\" Mr. Moss had opened the door and had entered the room. \\n\\n \\n\\n The greeting between the two men was closely observed by Rachel, who, though she was very imprudent in much that she did and much that she said, never allowed anything to pass by her unobserved. Mr. Moss, though he affected an intimacy with the lord, was beyond measure servile. Lord Castlewell accepted the intimacy without repudiating it, but accepted also the servility. \"Well, Moss, how are you getting on in this little house?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, my lord, you are going to rob us of our one attraction,\" and having bowed to the lord he turned round and bowed to the lady. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You have no right to keep such a treasure in a little place like this.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We can afford to pay for it, you know, my lord. M. Le Gros came here a little behind my back, and carried her off.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Much to her advantage, I should say.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We can pay,\" said Mr. Moss. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To such a singer as Mademoiselle O\u0027Mahony paying is not everything. An audience large enough, and sufficiently intelligent to appreciate her, is something more than mere money.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We have the most intelligent audience in all London,\" Mr. Moss said in defence of his own theatre. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No doubt,\" said the lord. He had, during this little intercourse of compliments, managed to write a word or two on a slip of paper, which he now handed to Rachel—\"Will ￡200 do?\" This he put into her hand, and then left her, saying that he would do himself the honour of calling upon her again at her own lodgings, \"where I shall hope,\" he said, \"to make the acquaintance of the most good-tempered fellow in the world.\" Then he took his leave. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2744/75564.html","bookId":1377,"book":{"id":1377,"title":"The Landleaguers","description":"简介： In the year 1850 the two estates of Ballintubber and Morony were sold to Mr. Philip Jones, under the Estates Court, which had then been established.
