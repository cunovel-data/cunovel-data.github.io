{"id":11418,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. EDITH\u0027S ELOQUENCE.","content":"Thus they lived through the months of January and February, 1881, at Morony Castle, and Florian had not as yet told his secret. As a boy his nature had seemed to be entirely altered during the last six months. He was thoughtful, morose, and obstinate to a degree, which his father was unable to fathom. But during these last two months there had been no intercourse between them. It may almost be said that no word had been addressed by either to the other. No further kind of punishment had been inflicted. Indeed, the boy enjoyed a much wider liberty than had been given to him before, or than was good for him. For his father not only gave no orders to him, but seldom spoke concerning him. It was, however, a terrible trouble to his mind, the fact that his own son should be thus possessed of his own peculiar secret, and should continue from month to month hiding it within his own bosom. With Father Malachi Mr. Jones was on good terms, but to him he could say nothing on the subject. The absurdity of the conversion, or perversion, of the boy, in reference to his religion, made Mr. Jones unwilling to speak of him to any Roman Catholic priest. Father Malachi would no doubt have owned that the boy had been altogether unable to see, by his own light, the difference between the two religions. But he would have attributed the change to the direct interposition of God. He would not have declared in so many words that a miracle had been performed in the boy\u0027s favour, but this would have been the meaning of the argument he would have used. In fact, the gaining of a proselyte under any circumstances would have been an advantage too great to jeopardise by any arguments in the matter. The Protestant clergyman at Headford, in whose parish Morony Castle was supposed to have been situated, was a thin, bigoted Protestant, of that kind which used to be common in Ireland. Mr. Armstrong was a gentleman, who held it to be an established fact that a Roman Catholic must necessarily go to the devil. In all the moralities he was perfect. He was a married man, with a wife and six children, all of whom he brought up and educated on ￡250 a year. He never was in debt; he performed all his duties—such as they were—and passed his time in making rude and unavailing attempts to convert his poorer neighbours. There was a union,—or poor-house—in the neighbourhood, to which he would carry morsels of meat in his pocket on Friday, thinking that the poor wretches who had flown in the face of their priest by eating the unhallowed morsels, would then have made a first step towards Protestantism. He was charitable, with so little means for charity; he was very eager in his discourses, in the course of which he would preach to a dozen Protestants for three-quarters of an hour, and would confine himself to one subject, the iniquities of the Roman Catholic religion. He had heard of Florian\u0027s perversion, and had made it the topic on which he had declaimed for two Sundays. He had attempted to argue with Father Brosnan, but had been like a babe in his hands. He ate and drank of the poorest, and clothed himself so as just to maintain his clerical aspect. All his aspirations were of such a nature as to entitle him to a crown of martyrdom. But they were certainly not of a nature to justify him in expecting any promotion on this earth. Such was Mr. Joseph Armstrong, of Headford, and from him no aid, or counsel, or pleasant friendship could be expected in this matter. The trouble of Florian\u0027s education fell for the nonce into Edith\u0027s hands. He had hitherto worked under various preceptors; his father, his sister, and his brother; also a private school at Galway for a time had had the charge of him. But now Edith alone undertook the duty. Gradually the boy began to have a way of his own, and to tell himself that he was only bound to be obedient during certain hours of the morning. In this way the whole day after twelve o\u0027clock was at his own disposal, and he never told any of the family what he then did. Peter, the butler, perhaps knew where he went, but even to Peter the butler, the knowledge was a trouble; for Peter, though a stanch Roman Catholic, was not inclined to side with anyone against his own master. Florian, in truth, did see more of Pat Carroll than he should have done; and, though it would be wrong to suppose that he took a part against his father, he no doubt discussed the questions which were of interest to Pat Carroll, in a manner that would have been very displeasing to his father. \"Faix, Mr. Flory,\" Pat would say to him, \"\u0027av you\u0027re one of us, you\u0027ve got to be one of us; you\u0027ve had a glimmer of light, as Father Brosnan says, to see the errors of your way; but you\u0027ve got to see the errors of your way on \u0027arth as well as above. Dragging the rint out o\u0027 the body and bones o\u0027 the people, like hair from a woman\u0027s head, isn\u0027t the way, and so you\u0027ll have to larn.\" Then Florian would endeavour to argue with his friend, and struggle to make him understand that in the present complicated state of things it was necessary that a certain amount of rent should go to Morony Castle to keep up the expenses there. \"We couldn\u0027t do, you know, without Peter; nor yet very well without the carriage and horses. It\u0027s all nonsense saying that there should be no rent; where are we to get our clothes from?\" But these arguments, though very good of their kind, had no weight with Pat Carroll, whose great doctrine it was that rent was an evil per se; and that his world would certainly go on a great deal better if there were no rent. \"Haven\u0027t you got half the land of Ballintubber in your hands?\" said Carroll. Here Florian in a whisper reminded Pat that the lands of Ballintubber were at this moment under water, and had been put so by his operation. \"Why wouldn\u0027t he make me a statement when I asked for it?\" said Carroll, with a coarse grin, which almost frightened the boy. \"Flory,\" said Edith to the boy that afternoon, \"you did see the men at work upon the sluices that afternoon?\" \"I didn\u0027t,\" said Florian. \"We all believe that you did.\" \"But I didn\u0027t.\" \"You may as well listen to me this once. We all believe that you did—papa and I, and Frank and Ada; Peter believes it; there\u0027s not a servant about the place but what believes it. Everybody believes it at Headford. Mr. Blake at Carnlough, and all the Blakes believe it.\" \"I don\u0027t care a bit about Mr. Blake,\" said the boy. \"But you do care about your own father. If you were to go up and down to Galway by the boat, you would find that everybody on board believes it. The country people would say that you had turned against your father because of your religion. Mr. Morris, from beyond Cong, was here the other day, and from what he said about the floods it was easy to see that he believed it.\" \"If you believe Mr. Morris better than you do me, you may go your own ways by yourself.\" \"I don\u0027t see that, Flory. I may believe Mr. Morris in this matter better than I do you, and yet not intend to go my own ways by myself. I don\u0027t believe you at all on this subject.\" \"Very well, then, don\u0027t.\" \"But I want to find out, if I can, what may be the cause of so terrible a falsehood on your part. It has come to that, that though you tell the lie, you almost admit that it is a lie.\" \"I don\u0027t admit it.\" \"It is as good as admitted. The position you assume is this: \u0027I saw the gates destroyed, but I am not going to say so in evidence, because it suits me to take part with Pat Carroll, and to go against my own father.\u0027\" \"You\u0027ve no business to put words like that into my mouth.\" \"I\u0027m telling you what everybody thinks. Would your father treat you as he does now without a cause? And are you to remain here, and to go down and down in the world till you become such a one as Pat Carroll? And you will have to live like Pat Carroll, with the knowledge in everyone\u0027s heart that you have been untrue to your father. They are becoming dishonest, false knaves, untrue to their promises, the very scum of the earth, because of their credulity and broken vows; but what am I to say of you? You will have been as false and perfidious and credulous as they. You will have thrown away everything good to gratify the ambition of some empty traitor. And you will have done it all against your own father.\" Here she paused and looked at him. They were roaming at the time round the demesne, and he walked on, but said nothing. \"I know what you are thinking of, Flory.\" \"What am I thinking of?\" \"You\u0027re thinking of your duty; you are thinking whether you can bring yourself to make a clean breast of it, and break the promises which you have made.\" \"Nobody should break a promise,\" said he. \"And nobody should tell a lie. When one finds oneself in the difficulty one has to go back and find out where the evil thing first began.\" \"I gave the promise first,\" said Florian. \"No such promise should ever have been given. Your first duty in the matter was to your father.\" \"I don\u0027t see that at all,\" said Florian. \"My first duty is to my religion.\" \"Even to do evil for its sake? Go to Father Malachi, and ask him.\" \"Father Malachi isn\u0027t the man to whom I should like to tell everything. Father Brosnan is a much better sort of clergyman. He is my confessor, and I choose to go by what he tells me.\" \"Then you will be a traitor to your father.\" \"I am not a traitor,\" said Florian. \"And yet you admit that some promise has been given—some promise which you dare not own. You cannot but know in your own heart that I know the truth. You have seen that man Carroll doing the mischief, and have promised him to hold your tongue about it. You have not, then, understood at all the nature or extent of the evil done. You have not, then, known that it would be your father\u0027s duty to put down this turbulent ruffian. You have promised, and having promised, Father Brosnan has frightened you. He and Pat Carroll together have cowed the very heart within you. The consequence is that you are becoming one of them, and instead of moving as a gentleman on the face of the earth, you will be such as they are. Tell the truth, and your father will at once send you to some school in England, where you will be educated as becomes my brother.\" The boy now was sobbing in tears. He lacked the resolution to continue his lie, but did not dare to tell the truth. \"I will,\" he whispered. \"What will you do?\" \"I will tell all that I know about it.\" \"Tell me, then, now.\" \"No, Edith, not now,\" he said. \"Will you tell papa, then?\" said Edith. \"Papa is so hard to me.\" \"Whom will you tell, and when?\" \"I will tell you, but not now. I will first tell Father Brosnan that I am going to do it; I shall not then have told the lie absolutely to my priest.\" On this occasion Edith could do nothing further with him; and, indeed, the nature of the confession which she expected him to make was such that it should be made to some person beyond herself. She could understand that it must be taken down in some form that would be presentable to a magistrate, and that evidence of the guilt of Pat Carroll and evidence as to the possible guilt of others must not be whispered simply into her own ears. But she had now brought him to such a condition that she did think that his story would be told.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2744/75551.html","bookId":1377,"book":{"id":1377,"title":"The Landleaguers","description":"简介： In the year 1850 the two estates of Ballintubber and Morony were sold to Mr. Philip Jones, under the Estates Court, which had then been established.
