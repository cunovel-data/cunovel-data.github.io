{"id":11416,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER XI. MOYTUBBER.","content":"\"What\u0027s all this about?\" said Tom as he rode up the covert side, and addressing a man whose face he happened to know. He was one Kit Mooney, a baker from Claregalway, who in these latter days had turned Landleaguer. But he was one who simply thought that his bread might be better buttered for him on that side of the question. He was not an ardent politician; but few local Irishmen were so. Had no stirring spirits been wafted across the waters from America to teach Irishmen that one man is as good as another, or generally better, Kit Mooney would never have found it out. Had not his zeal been awakened by the eloquence of Mr. O\u0027Meagher, the member for Athlone, who had just made a grand speech to the people at Athenry, Kit Mooney would have gone on in his old ways, and would at this moment have been touching his hat to Tom Daly, and whispering to him of the fox that had lately been seen \"staling away jist there, Mr. Daly, \u0027fore a\u0027most yer very eyes.\" But Mr. O\u0027Meagher had spent three glorious weeks in New York, and, having practised the art of speaking on board the steamer as he returned, had come to Athenry and filled the mind of Kit Mooney and sundry others with political truth of the deepest dye. But the gist of the truths so taught had been chiefly this:—that if a man did not pay his rent, but kept his money in his pocket, he manifestly did two good things; he enriched himself, and he so far pauperised the landlord, who was naturally his enemy. What other teaching could be necessary to make Kit understand,—Kit Mooney who held twenty acres of meadow land convenient to the town of Claregalway,—that this was the way to thrive in the world? \"Rent is not known in America, that great and glorious country. Every man owns the fields which he cultivates. Why should you here allow yourself to be degraded by the unmanly name of tenants? The earth which supports you should be as free to you as the air you breathe.\" Such had been the eloquence of Mr. O\u0027Meagher; and it had stirred the mind of Kit Mooney and made him feel that life should be recommenced by him under new principles. Things had not quite gone swimmingly with him since, because Nicholas Bodkin\u0027s agent had caused a sheriff\u0027s bailiff to appear upon the scene, and the notion of keeping the landlord\u0027s rent in the pocket had been found to be surrounded with difficulties. But the great principle was there, and there had come another eloquent man, who had also been in America; and Kit Mooney was now a confirmed Landleaguer. \n \n \"Faix thin, yer honour, it isn\u0027t much hunting the quality will see this day out of Moytubber; nor yet nowhere round, av the boys are as good as their word.\" \n \n \"Why should they not hunt at Moytubber?\" said Mr. Daly, who, as he looked around saw indeed ample cause why there should be no hunting. He had thought as he trotted along the road that some individual Landleaguer would hold his horse by the rein and cause him to stop him in the performance of his duty; but there were two hundred footmen there roaming at will through the sacred precincts of the gorse, and Daly knew well that no fox could have remained there with such a crowd around him. \n \n \"The boys are just taking their pleasure themselves this fine Christmas morning,\" said Kit, who had not moved from the bank on which he had been found sitting. \"Begorra, you\u0027ll find \u0027em all out about the counthry, intirely, Mr. Daly. They\u0027re out to make your honour welcome. There is lashings of \u0027em across in Phil French\u0027s woods and all down to Peter Brown\u0027s, away at Oranmore. There is not a boy in the barony but what is out to bid yer honour welcome this morning.\" \n \n Kit Mooney could not have given a more exact account of what was being done by \"the boys\" on that morning had he owned all those rich gifts of eloquence which Mr. O\u0027Meagher possessed. Tom Daly at once saw that there was no need for shooting any culprit, and was thankful. The interruption to the sport of the county had become much more general than he had expected, and it was apparently so organised as to have spread itself over all that portion of County Galway, in which his hounds ran. \"Bedad, Mr. Daly, what Kit says is thrue,\" said another man whom he did not know. \"You\u0027ll find \u0027em out everywhere. Why ain\u0027t the boys to be having their fun?\" \n \n It was useless to allow a hound to go into the covert of Moytubber. The crowd around was waiting anxiously to see the attempt made, so that they might enjoy their triumph. To watch Black Tom drawing Moytubber without a fox would be nuts to them; and then to follow the hounds on to the next covert, and to the next, with the same result, would afford them an ample day\u0027s amusement. But the Bodkins, and the Blakes, and the Persses were quite alive to this, and so also was Tom Daly. A council of war was therefore held, in order that the line of conduct might be adopted which might be held to be most conducive to the general dignity of the hunt. \n \n \"I should send the hounds home,\" said Lord Ardrahan. \"If Mr. Daly would call at my place and lunch, as he goes by, I should be most happy.\" \n \n Tom Daly, on hearing this, only shook his head. The shake was intended to signify that he did not like the advice tendered, nor the accompanying hospitable offer. To go home would be to throw down their arms at once, and acknowledge themselves beaten. If beaten to-day, why should they not be beaten on another day, and then what would become of Tom Daly\u0027s employment? A sad idea came across his mind, as he shook his head, warning him that in this terrible affair of to-day, he might see the end of all his life\u0027s work. Such a thought had never occurred to him before. If a crowd of disloyal Roman Catholics chose to prevent the gentry in their hunting, undoubtedly they had the power. Daly was slow at thinking, but an idea when it had once come home to him, struck him forcibly. As he shook his head at that moment he bethought himself, what would become of Black Daly if the people of the county refused to allow his hounds to run? And a second idea struck him,—that he certainly would not lunch with Lord Ardrahan. Lord Ardrahan was, to his thinking, somewhat pompous, and had been felt by Tom to expect that he, Tom, should acknowledge the inferiority of his position by his demeanour. Now such an idea as this was altogether in opposition to Tom\u0027s mode of living. Even though the hounds were to be taken away from him, and he were left at Daly\u0027s Bridge with the ￡200 a year which had come to him from his father, he would make no such acknowledgment as that to any gentleman in County Galway. So he shook his head, and said not a word in answer to Lord Ardrahan. \n \n \"What do you propose to do, Daly?\" demanded Mr. Persse. \n \n \"Go on and draw till night. There\u0027s a moon, and if we can find a fox before ten, Barney and I will manage to kill him. Those blackguards can\u0027t keep on with us.\" This was Daly\u0027s plan, spoken out within hearing of many of the blackguards. \n \n \"You had better take my offer, and come to Ardrahan Castle,\" said his lordship. \n \n \"No, my lord,\" said Daly, with the tone of authority which a master of hounds always knows how to assume. \n \n \"I shall draw on. Barney, get the hounds together.\" Then he whispered to Barney Smith that the hounds should go on to Kilcornan. Now Kilcornan was a place much beloved by foxes, about ten miles distant from Moytubber. It was not among the coverts appointed to be drawn on that day, which all lay back towards Ahaseragh. At Kilcornan the earths would be found to open. But it would be better to trot off rapidly to some distant home for foxes, even though the day\u0027s sport might be lost. Daly was very anxious that it should not be said through the country that he had been driven home by a set of roughs from any one covert or another. The day\u0027s draw would be known—the line of the country, that is, which, in the ordinary course of things, he would follow on that day. But by going to Kilcornan he might throw them off his scent. So he started for Kilcornan, having whispered his orders to Barney Smith, but communicating his intentions to no one else. \n \n \"What will you do, Daly?\" said Sir Jasper Lynch. \n \n \"Go on.\" \n \n \"But where will you go?\" inquired the baronet. He was a man about Daly\u0027s age, with whom Daly was on comfortable terms. He had no cause for being crabbed with Sir Jasper as with Lord Ardrahan. But he did not want to declare his purpose to any man. There is no one in the ordinary work of his life so mysterious as a master of hounds. And among masters no one was more mysterious than Tom Daly. And this, too, was no ordinary day. Tom only shook his head and trotted on in advance. His secret had been told only to Barney Smith, and with Barney Smith he knew that it would be safe. \n \n So they all trotted off at a pace much faster than usual. \"What\u0027s up with Black Tom now?\" asked Sir Nicholas of Sir Jasper. \"What\u0027s Daly up to now?\" asked Mr. Blake of Mr. Persse. They all shook their heads, and declared themselves willing to follow their leader without further inquiry. \"I suppose he knows what he\u0027s about,\" said Mr. Persse; \"but we, at any rate, must go and see.\" So they followed him; and in half an hour\u0027s time it became apparent that they were going to Kilcornan. \n \n But at Kilcornan they found a crowd almost equal to that which had stopped them at Moytubber. Kilcornan is a large demesne, into which they would, in the ordinary course, have made their entrance through the lodge gate. At present they went at once to an outlying covert, which was supposed to be especially the abode of foxes; but even here, as Barney trotted up with his hounds, at a pace much quicker than usual, they found that the ground before them had been occupied by Landleaguers. \"You\u0027ll not do much in the hunting way to-day, Muster Daly,\" said one of the intruders. \"When we heard you were a-coming we had a little hunt of our own. There ain\u0027t a fox anywhere about the place now, Muster Daly.\" Tom Daly turned round and sat on his big black horse, frowning at the world before him; a sorrowful man. What shall we do next? It does not behove a master of hounds to seek counsel in difficulty from anyone. A man, if he is master, should be sufficient to himself in all emergencies. No man felt this more clearly than did Black Tom Daly. He had been ashamed of himself once this morning, because he had taken advice from Mr. Persse. But now he must think the matter out for himself and follow his own devices. \n \n It was as yet only two o\u0027clock, but he had come on at a great pace, taking much more out of his horse than was usual to him on such occasions. But, sitting there, he did make up his mind. He would go on to Mr. Lambert\u0027s place at Clare, and would draw the coverts, going there as fast as the horse\u0027s legs would carry him. There he would borrow two horses if it were possible, but one, at least, for Barney Smith. Then he would draw back by impossible routes, to the kennels at Ahaseragh. Men might come with him or might go; but to none would he tell his mind. If Providence would only send him a fox on the route, all things, he thought, might still be well with him. It would be odd if he and Barney Smith, between them, were not able to give an account of that fox when they had done with him. But if he should find no such fox—if he, the master of the Galway hounds, should have ridden backwards and forwards across County Galway, and have been impeded altogether in his efforts by wretched Landleaguers, then—as he thought—a final day would have to come for him. \n \n He spoke no word to anyone, but he did go on just as he proposed to himself. He drew Clare, but drew it blank; and then, leaving his own horses, he borrowed two others for himself and Barney, and went on upon his route. Before the day was over—or rather, before the night was far advanced—he had borrowed three others, in his course about the country, for himself and his servants. Quick as lightning he went from covert to covert; but the conspiracy had been well arranged, and a holiday for the foxes in County Galway was established for that day. Some men were very stanch to him, going with him whither they knew not, so that \"poor dear Tom\" might not be left alone; but alone he was during the long evening of that day, as far as all conversation went. He spoke to no one, except to Barney, and to him only a few words; giving him a direction as to where he should go next, and into what covert he should put the hounds. They, too, must have been much surprised and very weary, as they dragged their tired limbs to their kennel, at about eight o\u0027clock. And Tom Daly\u0027s ride across the country will long be remembered, and the exertions which he made to find a fox on that day. \n \n But it was all in vain. As Tom ate his solitary mutton-chop, and drank his cold whisky and water, and then took himself to bed, he was a melancholy man. The occupation of his life, he thought, was gone. These reprobates, whom he now hated worse than ever, having learned their powers to disturb the amusements of their betters, would never allow another day\u0027s hunting in the county. He was aware now, though he never had thought of it before, by how weak a hold his right of hunting the country was held. He and his hounds could go into any covert; but so also could any other man, with or without hounds. To disturb a fox, three or four men would suffice; one would suffice according to Tom\u0027s idea of a fox. The occupation of his life was over. \n \n Tom Daly was by nature a melancholy man. All County Galway knew that. He was a man not given to many words, by no means devoted to sport in the ordinary sense. It was a hard business that he had undertaken. The work was in every sense hard, and the payment made was very small. In fact no payment was made, other than that of his being lifted into a position in which he was able to hold his head high among gentlemen of property. What should he do with himself during the remainder of his life, if hunting in County Galway was brought to an end? He was an intent, eager man, whom it was hard to teach that the occupations of his life were less worthy than those of other men. But there had come moments of doubt as he had sat alone in his little room at Ahaseragh and had meditated, whether the pursuit of vermin was worthy all the energy which he had given to it. \n \n \"You may sell those brutes of yours now, and then perhaps you\u0027ll be able to educate your children.\" So Sir Nicholas Bodkin had addressed his eldest son, as they rode home together on that occasion. \n \n \"Why so?\" Peter had asked, thinking more of the \"brutes\" alluded to than of the children. He was accustomed to the tone of his father\u0027s remarks, and cared for them not more than the ordinary son cares for the expression of the ordinary father\u0027s ill humour. But now he knew that some reference was intended to the interruption that had been made in their day\u0027s sport, and was anxious to learn what his father thought about it. \"Why so?\" he asked. \n \n \"Because you won\u0027t want them for this game any longer. Hunting is done with in these parts. When a blackguard like Kit Mooney is able to address such a one as Tom Daly after that fashion, anything that requires respect may be said to be over. Hunting has existed solely on respect. I had intended to buy that mare of French\u0027s, but I shan\u0027t now.\" \n \n \"What does all that mean, Lynch?\" said Mr. Persse to Sir Jasper, as they rode home together. \n \n \"It means quarrelling to the knife.\" \n \n \"In a quarrel to the knife,\" said Mr. Persse, \"all lighter things must be thrown away. Daly had brought a pistol in his pocket as you heard this morning. I have been thinking of it ever since; and, putting two and two together, it seems to me to be almost impossible that hunting should go on in County Galway.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2744/75549.html","bookId":1377,"book":{"id":1377,"title":"The Landleaguers","description":"简介： In the year 1850 the two estates of Ballintubber and Morony were sold to Mr. Philip Jones, under the Estates Court, which had then been established.
