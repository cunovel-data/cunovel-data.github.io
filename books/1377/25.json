{"id":11430,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXV. THE GALWAY BALL.","content":"When the 20th of May came, the three started off together for Galway, happy in spite of their boycotting. The girls at least were happy, though Frank was still somewhat sombre as he thought of the edict which Rachel O\u0027Mahony had pronounced against him. When the boat arrived at the quay at Galway, Captain Clayton, with one of the officers of the West Bromwich, was there to meet it. \"He is a wise man,\" whispered Edith to Ada, \"he takes care to provide for number one.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t see that at all,\" said Ada. \n \n \"That brave little warrior, who is four feet and a half high, is intended for my escort. Two is company and three is none. I quite agree as to that.\" Then they left the boat, and Edith so arranged the party that she was to walk between the small warrior and her brother, whereas Ada followed with Captain Clayton. In such straits of circumstances a man always has to do what he is told. Presence of mind and readiness is needful, but the readiness of a man is never equal to that of a woman. So they went off to Mrs. D\u0027Arcy\u0027s house, and Ada enjoyed all the little preliminary sweets of the Captain\u0027s conversation. The words that were spoken all had reference to Edith herself; but they came from the Captain and were assuredly sweet. \n \n \"And it\u0027s really true that you are boycotted?\" Mrs. D\u0027Arcy asked. \n \n \"Certainly it\u0027s true.\" \n \n \"And what do they do to you? Do all the servants leave you?\" \n \n \"Unless there be any like Peter who make up their minds to face the wrath of Landleaguers. Peter has lived with us a long time, and has to ask himself whether it will be best for him to stay or go.\" \n \n \"And he stays? What a noble fellow,\" said Mrs. D\u0027Arcy. \n \n \"What would he do with himself if he didn\u0027t stay?\" said Edith. \"I don\u0027t suppose they\u0027d shoot him, and he gets plenty to eat. The girls who were in the house and the young men about the place had friends of their own living near them, so they thought it better to go. Everybody of course does what is best for himself. And Peter, though he has suited himself, is already making a favour of it. Papa told him only yesterday that he might go himself if he pleased. Only think, we had to send all the horses last week into Galway to be shod;—and then they wouldn\u0027t do it, except one man who made a tremendous favour of it, and after doing it charged double.\" \n \n \"But won\u0027t they sell you anything at Tuam?\" \n \n \"Not a ha\u0027porth. We couldn\u0027t get so much as soap for house-washing, unless Mrs. Blake had stood by us and let us have her soap. Ada and I have to do every bit of washing about the place. I do think well of Peter because he insists on washing his own shirts and stockings. Unfortunately we haven\u0027t got a mangle, and we have to iron the sheets if we want them to look at all nice. Ada\u0027s sheets and mine, and Florian\u0027s, are only just rough pressed. Of course we get tea and those things down from Dublin. Only think of the way in which the tradespeople are ruining themselves. Everything has to go to Dublin to be sold: potatoes and cattle, and now butter. Papa says that they won\u0027t pay for the carriage. When you come to think of it, this boycotting is the most ruinous invention on both sides. When poor Florian declared that he would go to mass after he had first told the story about Pat Carroll, they swore they would boycott the chapel if he entered the door. Not a single person would stay to receive the mass. So he wouldn\u0027t go. It was not long after that when he became afraid to show his face outside the hall-door.\" \n \n \"And yet you can come here to this ball?\" said Mrs. D\u0027Arcy. \n \n \"Exactly so. I will go where I please till they boycott the very roads from under my feet. I expect to hear soon that they have boycotted Ada and me, so that no young man shall come and marry us. Of course, I don\u0027t understand such things, but it seems to me that the Government should interfere to defend us.\" \n \n When the evening came, and the witching hour was there, Ada and Edith appeared at the barracks as bright as their second-hand finery could make them. They had awarded to them something of especial glory as being boycotted heroines, and were regarded with a certain amount of envy by the Miss Blakes, Miss Bodkins, Miss Lamberts, Miss Ffrenchs, and Miss Parsons of the neighbourhood. They had, none of them, as yet achieved the full honours of boycotting, though some of them were half-way to it. The Miss Ffrenchs told them how their father\u0027s sheep had been boycotted, the shepherd having been made to leave his place. The Miss Blakes had been boycotted because their brother had been refused a car. And the Bodkins of Ballytowngal were held to have been boycotted en masse because of the doings at Moytubber gorse. But none of them had been boycotted as had been the Miss Jones\u0027; and therefore the Miss Jones\u0027 were the heroines of the evening. \n \n \"I declare it is very nice,\" Ada said to her sister that night, when they got home to Mrs. D\u0027Arcy\u0027s, \"because it got for us the pick of all the partners.\" \n \n \"It got for you one partner, at any rate,\" said Edith, \"either the boycotting or something else.\" Edith had determined that it should be so; or had determined at any rate that it should seem to be so. In her resolution that the hero of the day should fall in love with her sister, she had almost taught herself to think that the process had already taken place. It was so natural that the bravest man should fall in love with the fairest lady, that Edith took it for granted that it already was so. She too in some sort was in love with her own sister. Ada to her was so fair, so soft, so innocent, so feminine and so lovable, that her very heart was in the project,—and the project that Ada should have the hero of the hour to herself. And yet she too had a heart of her own, and had told herself in so many words, that she herself would have loved the man,—had it been fitting that she should burden him with such a love. She had rejected the idea as unfitting, impossible, and almost unfeminine. There was nothing in her to attract the man. The idea had sprung up but for a moment, and had been cast out as being monstrous. There was Ada, the very queen of beauty. And the gallant hero was languishing in her smiles. It was thus that her imagination carried her on, after the notion had once been entertained. At the ball Edith did in fact dance with Captain Clayton quite as often as did Ada herself, but she danced with him, she said, as the darling sister of his supposed bride. All her talk had been about Ada,—because Edith had so chosen the subject. But with Ada the conversation had all been about Edith, because the Captain had selected the subject. \n \n We all know how a little party is made up on such occasions. Though the party dance also with other people on occasions, they are there especially to dance with each other. An interloper or two now and again is very useful, so as to keep up appearances. The little warrior whom Edith had ill-naturedly declared to be four feet and a half high, but who was in truth five feet and a half, made up the former. Frank did not do much dancing, devoting himself to thinking of Rachel O\u0027Mahony. The little man, who was a distinguished officer named Captain Butler, of the West Bromwich, had a very good time of it, dancing with Ada when Captain Clayton was not doing so. \"The greatest brick I ever saw in my life!\"—it was thus Captain Butler afterwards spoke of Edith, \"but Ada is the girl for me, you know.\" Had Edith heard this, which she could not do, because she was then on the boat going back to Morony Castle, she would have informed Captain Butler that Ada was not the girl for him; but Captain Clayton, who heard the announcement made, did not seem to be much disturbed by it. \n \n \"It was a very nice party, Mrs. D\u0027Arcy,\" said Edith the next morning. \n \n \"Was there a supper?\" \n \n \"There was plenty to eat and drink, if you mean that, but we did not waste our time sitting down. I hate having to sit down opposite to a great ham when I am in the full tide of my emotions.\" \n \n \"There were emotions then?\" \n \n \"Of course there were. What\u0027s the good of a ball without them? Fancy Captain Butler and no emotions, or Captain Clayton! Ask Ada if there were not. But as far as we were concerned, it was I who had the best of it. Captain Butler was my special man for the evening, and he had on a beautiful red jacket with gold buttons. You never saw anything so lovely. But Captain Clayton had just a simple black coat. That is so ugly, you know.\" \n \n \"Is Captain Clayton Ada\u0027s special young man?\" \n \n \"Most particularly special, is he not, Ada?\" \n \n \"What nonsense you do talk, Edith. He is not my special young man at all. I\u0027m afraid he won\u0027t be any young woman\u0027s special young man very long, if he goes on as he does at present. Do you hear what he did over at Ardfry? There was some cattle to be seized for rent, and all the people on that side of the country were there. Ever so many shots were fired, and poor Hunter got wounded in his shoulder.\" \n \n \"He just had his skin raised,\" said Edith. \n \n \"And Captain Clayton got terribly mauled in the crowd. But he wouldn\u0027t fire a pistol at any of them. He brought some ringleader away prisoner,—he and two policemen. But they got all the cattle, and the tenants had to buy them back and pay their rent. When we try to seize cattle at Ballintubber they are always driven away to County Mayo. I do think that Captain Clayton is a real hero.\" \n \n \"Of course he is, my dear; that\u0027s given up to him long ago,—and to you.\" \n \n In the afternoon they went home by boat, and Frank made himself disagreeable by croaking. \"Upon my word,\" he said, \"I think that this is hardly a fit time for giving balls.\" \n \n \"Ginger should not be hot in the mouth,\" said Edith. \n \n \"You may put it in what language you like, but that is about what I mean. The people who go to the balls cannot in truth afford it.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s the officers\u0027 look out.\" \n \n \"And they are here on a very sad occasion. Everything is going to ruin in the country.\" \n \n \"I won\u0027t be put down by Pat Carroll,\" said Edith. \"He shall not be able to boast to himself that he has changed the natural course of my life.\" \n \n \"He has changed it altogether.\" \n \n \"You know what I mean. I am not going to yield to him or to any of them. I mean to hold my own against it as far as I can do so. I\u0027ll go to church, and to balls, and I\u0027ll visit my friends, and I\u0027ll eat my dinner every day of my life just as though Pat Carroll didn\u0027t exist. He\u0027s in prison just at present, and therefore so far we have got the best of him.\" \n \n \"But we can\u0027t sell a head of cattle without sending it up to Dublin. And we can\u0027t find a man to take charge of it on the journey. We can\u0027t get a shilling of rent, and we hardly dare to walk about the place in the broad light of day lest we should be shot at. While things are in this condition it is no time for dancing at balls. I am so broken-hearted at the present moment that but for my father and for you I would cut the place and go to America.\" \n \n \"Taking Rachel with you?\" said Edith. \n \n \"Rachel just now is as prosperous as we are the reverse. Rachel would not go. It is all very well for Rachel, as things are prosperous with her. But here we have the reverse of prosperity, and according to my feelings there should be no gaiety. Do you ever realise to yourself what it is to think that your father is ruined?\" \n \n \"We ought not to have gone,\" said Ada. \n \n \"Never say die,\" said Edith, slapping her little hand down on the gunwale of the boat. \"Morony Castle and Ballintubber belong to papa, and I will never admit that he is ruined because a few dishonest tenants refuse to pay their rents for a time. A man such as Pat Carroll can do him an injury, but papa is big enough to rise above that in the long run. At any rate I will live as becomes papa\u0027s daughter, as long as he approves and I have the power.\" Discussing these matters they reached the quay near Morony Castle, and Edith as she jumped ashore felt something of triumph in her bosom. She had at any rate succeeded in her object. \"I am sure we were right to go,\" she whispered to Ada. \n \n Their father received them with but very few words; nor had Florian much to say as to the glories of the ball. His mind was devoted at present to the coming trial. And indeed, in a more open and energetic manner, so was the mind of Captain Clayton. \"This will be the last holiday for me,\" he had said to Edith at the ball, \"before the great day comes off for Patrick Carroll, Esq. It\u0027s all very well for a man once in a way, but there should not be too much of it.\" \n \n \"You have not to complain deeply of yourself on that head.\" \n \n \"I have had my share of fun in the world,\" he said; \"but it grows less as I grow older. It is always so with a man as he gets into his work. I think my hair will grow grey very soon, if I do not succeed in having Mr. Carroll locked up for his life.\" \n \n \"Do you think they will convict him?\" \n \n \"I think they will? I do think they will. We have got one of the men who is ready to swear that he assisted him in pulling down the gates.\" \n \n \"Which of the men?\" she asked. \n \n \"I will tell you because I trust you as my very soul. His own brother, Terry, is the man. Pat, it seems, is a terrible tyrant among his own friends, and Terry is willing to turn against him, on condition that a passage to America be provided for him. Of course he is to have a free pardon for himself. We do want one man to corroborate your brother\u0027s evidence. Your brother no doubt was not quite straight at first.\" \n \n \"He lied,\" said Edith. \"When you and I talk about it together, we should tell the simple truth. We have pardoned him his lie;—but he lied.\" \n \n \"We have now the one man necessary to confirm his testimony.\" \n \n \"But he is the brother.\" \n \n \"No doubt. But in such a case as this anything is fair to get at the truth. And we shall employ no falsehoods. This younger Carroll was instigated by his brother to assist him in the deed. And he was seen by your brother to be one of those who assisted. It seems to me to be quite right.\" \n \n \"It is very terrible,\" Edith said. \n \n \"Yes; it is terrible. A brother will have to swear against a brother, and will be bribed to do it. I know what will be said to me very well. They have tried to shoot me down like a rat; but I mean to get the better of them. And when I shall have succeeded in removing Mr. Pat Carroll from his present sphere of life, I shall have a second object of ambition before me. Mr. Lax is another gentleman whom I wish to remove. Three times he has shot at me, but he has not hit me yet.\" \n \n From that time forth there had certainly been no more dances for Captain Clayton. His mind had been altogether devoted to his work, and amidst that work the trial of Pat Carroll had stood prominent. \"He and I are equally eager, or at any rate equally anxious;\" he had said to Edith, speaking of her brother, when he had met her subsequent to the ball. \"But the time is coming soon, and we shall know all about it in another six weeks.\" This was said in June, and the trial was to take place in August. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2744/75563.html","bookId":1377,"book":{"id":1377,"title":"The Landleaguers","description":"简介： In the year 1850 the two estates of Ballintubber and Morony were sold to Mr. Philip Jones, under the Estates Court, which had then been established.
