{"id":11428,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII. TOM DALY IS BOYCOTTED.","content":"When the time came round, Frank Jones started for Ballinasloe, with his father\u0027s cattle and with Peter to help him. They did succeed in getting a boy to go with them, who had been seduced by a heavy bribe to come down for the purpose from Ballinasloe to Morony Castle. As he had been used to cattle, Peter\u0027s ignorance and Frank\u0027s also were of less account. They drove the cattle to Tuam, and there got them on the railway, the railway with its servants being beyond the power of the boycotters. At Ballinasloe they could not sell the cattle, as the name of Mr. Jones of Morony had become terribly notorious throughout County Galway. But arrangements had been made to send them to a salesman up in Dublin, and from Ballinasloe they had gone under the custody of Peter and the boy. No attempt was made absolutely to harm the beasts, or even to stop them in the streets. But throughout the town it seemed to be perfectly understood that they were the property of Philip Jones of Morony Castle, and that Philip Jones had been boycotted by the League. The poor beasts were sent on to Dublin without a truss of hay among them, and even Frank himself was refused a meal at the first inn at which he had called. He did afterwards procure accommodation; but he heard while in the house, that the innkeeper was threatened for what he had done. Had it not been that Peter had brought with him a large basket of provisions for himself and the boy, they, too, would have been forced to go on dinnerless and supperless to Dublin. \\n\\n \\n\\n Frank, on his way back home, resolved that he would call on Mr. Daly at Daly\u0027s Bridge, near Castle Blakeney. It was Daly\u0027s wont to live at Daly\u0027s Bridge when the hounds were not hunting, though he would generally go four or five times a week from Daly\u0027s Bridge to the kennels. To Castle Blakeney a public car was running, and the public car did not dare, or probably did not wish, to boycott anyone. He walked up to the open door at Daly\u0027s Bridge and soon found himself in the presence of Black Tom Daly. \"So you are boycotted?\" said Tom. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Horse, foot, and dragoons,\" said Frank. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s to come of it, I wonder?\" Tom as he said this was sitting at an open window making up some horse\u0027s drug to which was attached some very strong odour. \"I am boycotted too, and the poor hounds, which have given hours of amusement to many of these wretches, for which they have not been called upon to pay a shilling. I shall have to sell the pack, I\u0027m afraid,\" said Tom, sadly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not yet, I hope, Mr. Daly.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What do you mean by that? Who\u0027s to keep them without any subscription? And who\u0027s to subscribe without any prospect of hunting? For the matter of that who\u0027s to feed the poor dumb brutes? One pack will be boycotted after another till not a pack of hounds will be wanted in all Ireland.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Has the same thing happened to any other pack?\" asked Frank. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Certainly it has. They turned out against the Muskerry; and there\u0027s been a row in Kildare. We are only at the beginning of it yet.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t suppose it will go on for ever,\" said Frank. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you suppose so? What\u0027s to be the end of it all? Do you see any way out of it?—for I do not. Does your father see his way to bringing those meadows back into his hands? I\u0027m told that some of those fellows shot at Clayton the other day down at Headford. How are we to expect a man like Clayton to come forward and be shot at in that fashion? As far as I can see there will be no possibility for anyone to live in this country again. Of course it\u0027s all over with me. I haven\u0027t got any rents to speak of, and the only property I possess is now useless.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What property?\" asked Frank. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What property?\" rejoined Tom in a voice of anger. \"What property? Ain\u0027t the hounds property, or were property a few weeks ago? Who\u0027ll subscribe for next year? We had a meeting in February, you know, and the fellows put down their names the same as ever. But they can\u0027t be expected to pay when there will be no coverts for them to draw. The country can do nothing to put a stop to this blackguardism. When they\u0027ve passed this Coercion Bill they\u0027re going to have some sort of Land Bill,—just a law to give away the land to somebody. What\u0027s to come of the poor country with such men as Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Bright to govern it? They\u0027re the two very worst men in the whole empire for governing a country. Martial law with a regiment in each county, and a strong colonel to carry it out,—that is the only way of governing left us. I don\u0027t pretend to understand politics, but every child can see that. And you should do away with the constituencies, at any rate for the next five years. What are you to expect with such a set of men as that in Parliament,—men whom no one would speak to if they were to attempt to ride to hounds in County Galway. It makes me sick when I hear of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Such were Tom Daly\u0027s sad outlooks into the world. And sad as they were, they seemed to be justified by circumstances as they operated upon him. There could be no hunting in County Galway next session unless things were to change very much for the better. And there was no prospect of any such change. \"It\u0027s nonsense talking of a poor devil like me being ruined. You ask me what property I have got.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think I ever asked that,\" said Frank. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It don\u0027t matter. You\u0027re quite welcome. You\u0027ll find eight or nine pair of leather breeches in that press in there. And round about the room somewhere there are over a dozen pair of top-boots. They are the only available property I have got. They are paid for, and I can do what I please with them. The four or five hundred acres over there on the road to Tuam are mostly bog, and are strictly entailed so that I cannot touch them. As there is not a tenant will pay the rent since I\u0027ve been boycotted it doesn\u0027t make much matter. I have not had a shilling from them for more than twelve months; and I don\u0027t suppose I ever shall see another. The poor hounds are eating their heads off; as fine a pack of hounds as any man ever owned, as far as their number goes. I can\u0027t keep them, and who\u0027ll buy them? They tell me I must send them over to Tattersall\u0027s. But as things are now I don\u0027t suppose they\u0027ll pay the expense. I don\u0027t care who knows it, but I haven\u0027t three hundred pounds in the world. And I\u0027m over fifty years of age. What do you think of that as the condition for a man to be brought to?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Frank Jones had never heard Daly speak at such length before, nor had he given him credit for so much eloquence. Nor, indeed, had anyone in the County of Galway heard him speak so many words till this misfortune had fallen upon him. And he would still be silent and reserved with all except a few hunting men whom he believed to be strongly influenced by the same political feeling as he was himself. Here was he boycotted most cruelly, but not more cruelly than was Mr. Jones of Morony Castle. The story of Florian Jones had got about the county, and had caused Mr. Jones to be pitied greatly by such men as Tom Daly. \"His own boy to turn against him!\" Tom had said. \"And to become a Papist! A boy of ten years old to call himself a Papist, as if he would know anything about it. And then to lie,—to lie like that! I feel that his case is almost worse than mine.\" Therefore he had burst out with his sudden eloquence to Frank Jones, whom he had liked. \"Oh, yes! I can send you over to Woodlawn Station. I have got a horse and car left about the place. Here\u0027s William Persse of Galway. He\u0027s the stanchest man we have in the county, but even he can do nothing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Then Mr. Persse rode into the yard,—that Mr. Persse who, when the hounds met at Ballytowngal, had so strongly dissuaded Daly from using his pistol. He was a man who was reputed to have a good income, or at any rate a large estate,—though the two things at the present moment were likely to have a very various meaning. But he was a man less despondent in his temperament than Tom Daly, and one that was likely to prevail with Tom by the strength of his character. \"Well, Tom,\" said Persse, as he walked into the house, \"how are things using you now? How are you, Jones? I\u0027m afraid your father is getting it rather hot at Morony Castle.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They\u0027ve boycotted us, that\u0027s all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So I understand. Is it not odd that some self-appointed individual should send out an edict, and that suddenly all organised modes of living among people should be put a stop to! Here\u0027s Tom not allowed to get a packet of greaves into his establishment unless he sends to Dublin for it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nor to have it sent over here,\" said Tom, \"unless I\u0027ll send my own horse and cart to fetch it. And every man and boy I have about the place is desired to leave me at the command of some d——d O\u0027Toole, whose father kept a tinker\u0027s shop somewhere in County Mayo, and whose mother took in washing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a depth of scorn intended to be conveyed by all this, because in Daly\u0027s estimation County Mayo was but a poor county to live in, as it had not for many a year possessed an advertised pack of fox-hounds. And the O\u0027Tooles were not one of the tribes of Galway, or a clan especially esteemed in that most aristocratic of the western counties. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Have all the helpers gone?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t asked them to stay; but unless they have stayed of their own accord I have just shaken hands with them. It\u0027s all that one gentleman can do to another when he meets him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Daly is talking of selling the hounds,\" said Frank Jones. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not quite yet, Tom,\" said Mr. Persse. \"You mustn\u0027t do anything in a hurry.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They\u0027ll have to starve if they remain here,\" said the master of hounds. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have come over here to say a word about them. I don\u0027t suppose this kind of thing will last for ever, you know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can you see any end to it?\" said the other. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not as yet I can\u0027t, except that troubles when they come generally do have an end. We always think that evils will last for ever,—and blessings too. When two-year-old ewes went up to three pound ten at Ballinasloe, we thought that we were to get that price for ever, but they were soon down to two seventeen six; and when we had had two years of the potato famine, we thought that there would never be another potato in County Galway. For the last five years we\u0027ve had them as fine at Doneraile as ever I saw them. Nobody is ever quite ruined, or quite has his fortune made.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am very near the ruin,\" said Tom Daly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I would struggle to hold on a little longer yet,\" said the other. \"How many horses have you got here and at Ahaseragh?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There are something over a dozen,\" said Tom. \"There may be fifteen in all. I was thinking of sending a draught over to Tattersall\u0027s next week. There are some of them would not be worth a five-and-twenty-pound note when you got them there!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, now I\u0027ll tell you what I propose. You shall send over four or five to be summered at Doneraile. There is grass enough there, and though I can\u0027t pay my debts, my credit is good at the corn-chandler\u0027s.\" Black Tom, as he heard this, sat still looking blacker than ever. He was a man who hated to have a favour offered to him. But he could bear the insult better from Persse of Doneraile than from anyone else in the county. \"I\u0027ve talked the matter over with Lynch—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"D—— Lynch,\" said Daly. He didn\u0027t dislike Sir Jasper, but Sir Jasper did not stand quite so high in his favour as did Mr. Persse of Doneraile. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You needn\u0027t d—— anybody; but just listen to me. Sir Jasper says that he will take three, and Nicholas Bodkin will do the same.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They are both baronets,\" said Daly. \"I hate a man with a handle to his name; he always seems to me to be stuck-up, as though he demanded something more than other people. There is that Lord Ardrahan—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A very good fellow too. Don\u0027t you be an ass. Lord Ardrahan has offered to take three more.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I knew it,\" said Tom. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s not as though any favour were offered or received. Though the horses are your own property, they are kept for the services of the hunt. We all understand very well how things are circumstanced at present.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How do you think I am to feed my hounds if you take away the horses which they would eat?\" said Daly, with an attempt at a grim joke. But after the joke Tom became sad again, almost to tears, and he allowed his friend to make almost what arrangements he pleased for distributing both hounds and horses among the gentry of the hunt. \"And when they are gone,\" said he, \"I am to sit here alone with nothing on earth to do. What on earth is to become of me when I have not a hound left to give a dose of physic to?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We\u0027ll not leave you in such a sad strait as that,\" said Mr. Persse. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It will be sad enough. If you had had a pack of hounds to look after for thirty summers, you wouldn\u0027t like to get rid of them in a hurry. I\u0027m like an old nurse who is sending her babies out, or some mother, rather, who is putting her children into the workhouse because she cannot feed them herself. It is sad, though you don\u0027t see it in that light.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Frank Jones got home to Castle Morony that night full of sorrow and trouble. The cattle had been got off to Dublin in their starved condition, but he, as he had come back, had been boycotted every yard of the way. He could get in no car, nor yet in all Tuam could he secure the services of a boy to carry his bag for him. He learned in the town that the girls had sent over to purchase a joint of meat, but had been refused at every shop. \"Is trade so plentiful?\" asked Frank, \"that you can afford to do without it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We can\u0027t afford to do with it,\" said the butcher, \"if it\u0027s to come from Morony Castle.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2744/75561.html","bookId":1377,"book":{"id":1377,"title":"The Landleaguers","description":"简介： In the year 1850 the two estates of Ballintubber and Morony were sold to Mr. Philip Jones, under the Estates Court, which had then been established.
