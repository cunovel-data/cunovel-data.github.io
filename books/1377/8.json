{"id":11413,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. CHRISTMAS-DAY, 1880.","content":"On Christmas-day Rachel O\u0027Mahony wrote a letter to her lover at Morony Castle: \n \n \n Cecil Street, Christmas-day, 1880. \n \n Dearest Frank, \n \n You do love me, don\u0027t you? What\u0027s the use of my loving you, and thinking that you are everything, only that you are to love me? I am quite content that it should be so. Only let it be so. You\u0027ll ask me what reason I have to be jealous. I am not jealous. I do think in my heart that you think that I\u0027m—just perfect. And when I tell myself that it is so, I lay myself back in my chair and kiss at you with my lips till I am tired of kissing the space where you ain\u0027t. But if I am wrong, and if you are having a good time of it with Miss Considine at Mrs. McKeon\u0027s ball, and are not thinking a bit of me and my kisses, what\u0027s the use? It\u0027s a very unfair bargain that a woman makes with a man. \"Yes; I do love you,\" I say,—\"but—\" Then there\u0027s a sigh. \"Yes; I\u0027ll love you,\" you say—\"if—\" Then there\u0027s a laugh. If I tell a fib, and am not worth having, you can always recuperate. But we can\u0027t recuperate. I\u0027m to go about the world and be laughed at, as the girl that Frank Jones made a fool of. Oh! Mr. Jones, if you treat me in that way, won\u0027t I punish you? I\u0027ll jump into the lough with a label round my neck telling the whole story. But I am not a bit jealous, because I know you are good. \n \n And now I must tell you a bit more of my history. We got rid of that lovely hotel, paying ￡6 10s., when that just earned ￡1. And I have brought the piano with me. The man at Erard\u0027s told me that I should have it for ￡2 10s. a month, frankly owning that he hoped to get my custom. \"But Mr. Moss is to pay nothing?\" I asked. He swore that Mr. Moss would have to pay nothing, and leave what occurred between him and me. I don\u0027t think he will. ￡30 a year ought to be enough for the hire of a piano. So here we are established, at ￡10 a month—the first-floor, with father\u0027s bedroom behind the sitting-room. I have the room upstairs over the sitting-room. They are small stumpy little rooms,—\"but mine own.\" Who says—\"But mine own?\" Somebody does, and I repeat it. They are mine own, at any rate till next Saturday. \n \n And we have settled this terrible engagement and signed it. I\u0027m to sing for Moss at \"The Embankment\" for four months, at the rate of ￡600 a year. It was a Jew\u0027s bargain, for I really had filled the house for a fortnight. Fancy a theatre called \"The Embankment\"! There is a nasty muddy rheumatic sound about it; but it\u0027s very prettily got up, and the exits and entrances are also good. Father goes with me every night, but I mean to let him off the terrible task soon. He smiles, and says he likes it. I only tell him he would be a child if he did. They want to change the piece, but I shall make them pay me for my dresses; I am not going to wear any other woman\u0027s old clothes. It\u0027s not the proper way to begin, you have to begin as a slave or as an empress. Of course, anybody prefers to do the empress. They try, and then they fail, and tumble down. I shall tumble down, no doubt; but I may as well have my chance. \n \n And now I\u0027m going to make you say that I\u0027m a beast. And so I am. I make a little use of Mahomet M. M.\u0027s passion to achieve my throne instead of taking up at once with serfdom. But I do it without vouchsafing him even the first corner of a smile. The harshest treatment is all that he gets. Men such as Mahomet M. will live on harsh treatment for a while, looking forward to revenge when their time comes. But I shall soon have made sure of my throne, or shall have failed; and in either case shall cease to care for Mahomet M. By bullying him and by treating him as dust beneath my feet, I can do something to show how proud I am, and how sure I am of success. He offers me money—not paid money down, which would have certain allurements. I shouldn\u0027t take it. I needn\u0027t tell you that. I should like to have plenty of loose sovereigns, so as to hire broughams from the yard, instead of walking, or going in a \u0027bus about London, which is very upsetting to my pride. Father and I go down to the theatre in a hansom, when we feel ourselves quite smart. But it isn\u0027t money like that which he offers. He wants to pay me a month in advance, and suggests that I shall get into debt, and come to him to get me out of it. There was some talk of papa going to New York for a few weeks, and he said he would come and look after me in his absence. \"Thank you, Mr. Moss,\" I said, \"but I\u0027m not sure I should want any looking after, only for such as you.\" Those are the very words I spoke, and I looked him full in the face. \"Why, what do you expect from me?\" he said. \"Insult,\" I replied, as bold as brass. And then we are playing the two lovers at \"The Embankment.\" Isn\u0027t it a pretty family history? He said nothing at the moment, but came back in half an hour to make some unnecessary remarks about the part. \"Why did you say just now that I insulted you?\" he asked. \"Because you do,\" I replied. \"Never, never!\" he exclaimed, with most grotesque energy. \"I have never insulted you.\" You know, my dear, he has twenty times endeavoured to kiss my hand, and once he saw fit to stroke my hair. Beast! If you knew the sort of feeling I have for him—such as you would have if you found a cockroach in your dressing-case. Of course in our life young women have to put up with this kind of thing, and some of them like it. But he knows that I am going to be married, or at any rate am engaged, Mr. Frank. I make constant use of your name, telling everybody that I am the future Mrs. Jones, putting such weight upon the Jones. With me he knows that it is an insult; but I don\u0027t want to quarrel with him if I can help it, and therefore I softened it down. \"You hear me say, Mr. Moss, that I\u0027m an engaged young woman. Knowing that, you oughtn\u0027t to speak to me as you do.\" \"Why, what do I say?\" You should have seen his grin as he asked me; such a leer of triumph, as though he knew that he were getting the better of me. \"Mr. Jones wouldn\u0027t approve if he were to see it.\" \"But luckily he don\u0027t,\" said my admirer. Oh, if you knew how willingly I\u0027d stand at a tub and wash your shirts, while the very touch of his gloves makes me creep all over with horror. \"Let us have peace for the future,\" I said. \"I dislike all those familiarities. If you will only give them up we shall go on like a house on fire.\" Then the beast made an attempt to squeeze my hand as he went out of the room. I retreated, however, behind the table, and escaped untouched on that occasion. \n \n You are not to come over, whatever happens, until I tell you. You ought to know very well by this time that I can fight my battles by myself; and if you did come, there would be an end altogether to the ￡200 which I am earning. To give him his due, he\u0027s very punctual with his money, only that he wants to pay me in advance, which I will never have. He has been liberal about my dresses, telling me to order just what I want, and have the bill sent in to the costume manager. When I have worn them they become the property of the theatre. God help any poor young woman that will ever be expected to get into them. So now you know exactly how I am standing with Mahomet M. M. \n \n Poor father goes about to public meetings, but never is allowed to open his mouth for fear he should say something about the Queen. I don\u0027t mean that he is really watched, but he promised in Ireland not to lecture any more if they would let him go, and he wishes to keep his word. But I fear it makes him very unhappy. He has, at any rate, the comfort of coming home and giving me the lecture, which he ought to have delivered to more sympathetic ears. Not but what I do care about the people; only how am I to know whether they ought to be allowed to make their own petticoats, or why it is that they don\u0027t do so? He says it\u0027s the London Parliament; and that if they had members in College Green, the young women would go to work at once, and make petticoats for all the world. I don\u0027t understand it, and wish that he had someone else to lecture to. \n \n How are you getting on with all your own pet troubles? Is the little subsiding lake at Ballintubber still a lake? And what about poor Florian and his religion? Has he told up as yet? I fear, I fear, that poor Florian has been fibbing, and that there will be no peace for him or for your father till the truth has been told. \n \n Now, sir, I have told you everything, just as a young woman ought to tell her future lord and master. You say you ought to know what Moss is doing. You do know, exactly, as far as I can tell you. Of course you wouldn\u0027t like to see him, but then you have the comfort of knowing that I don\u0027t like it either. I suppose it is a comfort, eh, my bold young man? Of course you want me to hate the pig, and I do hate him. You may be sure that I will get rid of him as soon as I conveniently can. But for the present he is a necessary evil. If you had a home to give me, I would come to it—oh, so readily! There is something in the glitter of a theatre—what people call the boards, the gaslights, the music, the mock love-making, the pretence of being somebody, the feeling of mystery which is attached to you, and the feeling you have that you are generally unlike the world at large—which has its charms. Even your name, blazoned in a dirty playbill, without any Mister or Mistress to guard you, so unlike the ways of ordinary life, does gratify one\u0027s vanity. I can\u0027t say why it should be so, but it is. I always feel a little prouder of myself when father is not with me. I am Miss O\u0027Mahony, looking after myself, whereas other young ladies have to be watched. It has its attractions. \n \n But—but to be the wife of Frank Jones, and to look after Frank\u0027s little house, and to cook for him his chicken and his bacon, and to feel that I am all the world to him, and to think—! But, oh, Frank, I cannot tell you what things I think. I do feel, as I think them, that I have not been made to stand long before the glare of the gas, and that the time will certainly come when I shall walk about Ballintubber leaning on your arm, and hearing all your future troubles about rents not paid, and waters that have come in. \n \n Your own, own girl, \n \n Rachel O\u0027Mahony. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2744/75546.html","bookId":1377,"book":{"id":1377,"title":"The Landleaguers","description":"简介： In the year 1850 the two estates of Ballintubber and Morony were sold to Mr. Philip Jones, under the Estates Court, which had then been established.
