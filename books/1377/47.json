{"id":11452,"no":47,"title":"CHAPTER XLVII. KERRYCULLION.","content":"Captain Clayton was thoroughly enjoying life, now perhaps, for the first time since he had had a bullet driven through his body. It had come to pass that everything, almost everything, was done for him by the hands of Edith. And yet Ada was willing to do everything that was required; but she declared always that what she did was of no avail. \"Unless you take it to him, you know he won\u0027t eat it,\" she would still say. No doubt this was absurd, because the sick man\u0027s appetite was very good, considering that a hole had been made from his front to his back within the last month. It was still September, the weather was as warm as summer, and he insisted on lying out in the garden with his rugs around him, and enjoying the service of all his slaves. But among his slaves Edith was the one whom the other slaves found it most difficult to understand. \"I will go on,\" she said to her father, \"and do everything for him while he is an invalid. But, when he is well enough to be moved, either he or I must go out of this.\" Her father simply said that he did not understand it; but then he was one of the other slaves. \"Edith,\" said the Captain, one day, speaking from his rugs on the bank upon the lawn, \"just say that one word, \u0027I yield.\u0027 It will have to be said sooner or later.\" \"I will not say it, Captain Clayton,\" said Edith with a firm voice. \"So you have gone back to the Captain,\" said he. \"I will go back further than that, if you continue to annoy me. It shall be nothing but plain \u0027sir,\u0027 as hard as you please. You might as well let go my hand; you know that I do not take it away violently, because of your wound.\" \"I know—I know—I know that a girl\u0027s hand is the sweetest thing in all creation if she likes you, and leaves it with you willingly.\" Then there was a little pull, but it was only very little. \"Of course, I don\u0027t want to hurt you,\" said Edith. \"And, therefore, it feels as though you loved me. Of course it does. Your hand says one thing and your voice another. Which way does your heart go?\" \"Right against you,\" said Edith. But she could not help blushing at the lie as she told it. \"My conscience is altogether against you, and I advise you to attend more to that than to anything else.\" But still he held her hand, and still she let him hold it. At that moment Hunter appeared upon the scene, and Edith regained her hand. But had the Captain held the hand, Hunter would not have seen it. Hunter was full of his own news; and, as he told it, very dreadful the story was. \"There has been a murder worse than any that have happened yet, just the other side of the lake,\" and he pointed away to the mountains, and to that part of Lough Corrib which is just above Cong. \"Another murder?\" said Edith. \"Oh, miss, no other murder ever told of had any horror in it equal to this! I don\u0027t know how the governor will keep himself quiet there, with such an affair as this to be looked after. There are six of them down,—or at any rate five.\" \"When a doubt creeps in, one can always disbelieve as much as one pleases.\" \"You can hardly disbelieve this, sir, as I have just heard the story from Sergeant Malcolm. There were six in the house, and five have been carried out dead. One has been taken to Cong, and he is as good as dead. Their names are Kelly. An old man and an old woman, and another woman and three children. The old woman was very old, and the man appears to have been her son.\" \"Have they got nobody?\" asked Clayton. \"It appears not, sir. But there is a rumour about the place that there were many of them in it.\" \"Looking after one another,\" said Clayton, \"so that none should escape his share of the guilt.\" \"It may be so. But there were many in it, sir. I can\u0027t tell much of the circumstances, except the fact that there are the five bodies lying dead.\" And Hunter, with some touch of dramatic effect and true pathos, pointed again to the mountains which he had indicated as the spot where this last murder was committed. It was soon settled among them that Hunter should go off to the scene of action, Cong, or wherever else his services might be required, and that he should take special care to keep his master acquainted with all details as they came to light. For us, we may give here the details as they did reach the Captain\u0027s ears in the course of the next few days. Hunter\u0027s story had only been too true. The six persons had been murdered, barring one child, who had been taken into Cong in a state which was supposed hardly to admit of his prolonged life. The others, who now lay dead at a shebeen house in the neighbourhood, consisted of an old woman and her son, and his wife and a grown daughter, and a son. All these had been killed in various ways,—had been shot with rifles, and stoned with rocks, and made away with, after any fashion that might come most readily to the hands of brutes devoid of light, of mercy, of conscience, and apparently of fear. It must have been a terrible sight to see, for those who had first broken in upon the scene of desolation. In the course of the next morning it had become known to the police, and it was soon rumoured throughout England and Ireland that there had been ten murderers engaged in the bloody fray. It must have been as Captain Clayton had surmised; one with another intent upon destroying that wretched family,—or perhaps only one among its number,—had insisted that others should accompany him. A man who had been one of their number was less likely to tell if he had a hand in it himself. And so there were ten of them. It might be that one among the number of the murdered had seen the murder of Mr. Morris, or of Pat Gilligan, or the attempted murder of Captain Clayton. And that one was not sure not to tell,—had perhaps shown by some sign and indication that to tell the truth about the deed was in his breast,—or in hers! Some woman living there might have spoken such a word to a friend less cautious in that than were the neighbours in general. Then we can hear, or fancy that we can hear, the muttered reasons of those who sought to rule amidst that bloody community. They were a family of the Kellys,—these poor doomed creatures,—but amidst those who whispered together, amidst those who were forced to come into the whispering, there were many of the same family; or, at any rate, of the same name. For the Kellys were a tribe who had been strong in the land for many years. Though each of the ten feared to be of the bloody party, each did not like not to be of it, for so the power would have come out of their hands. They wished to be among the leading aristocrats, though still they feared. And thus they came together, dreading each other, hating each other at last; each aware that he was about to put his very life within the other\u0027s power, and each trying to think, as far as thoughts would come to his dim mind, that to him might come some possibility of escape by betraying his comrades. But a miracle had occurred,—that which must have seemed to be a miracle when they first heard it, and to the wretches themselves, when its fatal truth was made known to them. While in the dead of night they were carrying out this most inhuman massacre there were other eyes watching them; six other eyes were looking at them, and seeing what they did perhaps more plainly than they would see themselves! Think of the scene! There were six persons doomed, and ten who had agreed to doom them; and three others looking on from behind a wall, so near as to enable them to see it all, under the fitful light of the stars! Nineteen of them engaged round one small cabin, of whom five were to die that night;—and as to ten others, it cannot but be hoped that the whole ten may pay the penalty due to the offended feelings of an entire nation! It may be that it shall be proved that some among the ten had not struck a fatal blow. Or it may fail to be proved that some among the ten have done so. It will go hard with any man to adjudge ten men to death for one deed of murder; and it is very hard for that one to remember always that the doom he is to give is the only means in our power to stop the downward path of crime among us. It may be that some among the ten shall be spared, and it may be that he or they who spare them shall have done right. But such was not the feeling of Captain Yorke Clayton as he discussed the matter, day after day, with Hunter, or with Frank Jones, upon the lawn at Castle Morony. \"It would be the grandest sight to see,—ten of them hanging in a row.\" \"The saddest sight the world could show,\" said Frank. \"Sad enough, that the world should want it. But if you had been employed as I have for the last few years, you would not think it sad to have achieved it. If the judge and the jury will do their work as it should be done there will be an end to this kind of thing for many years to come. Think of the country we are living in now! Think of your father\u0027s condition, and of the injury which has been done to him and to your sisters, and to yourself. If that could be prevented and atoned for, and set right by the hanging in one row of ten such miscreants as those, would it not be a noble deed done? These ten are frightful to you because there are ten at once,—ten in the same village,—ten nearly of the same name! People would call it a bloody assize where so many are doomed. But they scruple to call the country bloody where so many are murdered day after day. It is the honest who are murdered; but would it not be well to rid the world of these ruffians? And, remember, that these ten would not have been ten, if some one or two had been dealt with for the first offence. And if the ten were now all spared, whose life would be safe in such a Golgotha? I say that, to those who desire to have their country once more human, once more fit for an honest man to live in, these ten men hanging in a row will be a goodly sight.\" There must have been a feeling in the minds of these three men that some terrible step must be taken to put an end to the power of this aristocracy, before life in the country would be again possible. When they had come together to watch their friends and neighbours, and see what the ten were about to do, there must have been some determination in their hearts to tell the story of that which would be enacted. Why should these ten have all the power in their own hands? Why should these questions of life and death be remitted to them, to the exclusion of those other three? And if this family of Kellys were doomed, why should there not be other families of other Kellys,—why not their own families? And if Kerrycullion were made to swim in blood,—for that was the name of the townland in which these Kellys lived,—why not any other homestead round the place in which four or five victims may have hidden themselves? So the three, with mutual whisperings among themselves, with many fears and with much trembling, having obtained some tidings of what was to be done, agreed to follow and to see. It was whispered about that one of the family, the poor man\u0027s wife, probably, had seen the attack made upon poor Pat Gilligan, and may, or may not, have uttered some threat of vengeance; may have shown some sign that the murder ought to be made known to someone. Was not Pat Gilligan her sister\u0027s husband\u0027s brother\u0027s child? And he was not one of the other, the rich aristocracy, against whom all men\u0027s hands were justly raised. Some such word had probably passed the unfortunate woman\u0027s lips, and the ten men had risen against her. The ten men, each protecting each other, had sworn among themselves that so villainous a practice, so glaring an evil as this, of telling aught to the other aristocracy, must be brought to an end. But then the three interfered, and it was likely that the other, the rich aristocracy, should now know all about it. It was not to save the lives of those unfortunate women and children that they went. There would be danger in that. And though the women and children were, at any rate, their near neighbours, why should they attempt to interfere and incur manifest dangers on their account? But they would creep along and see, and then they could tell; or should they be disturbed in their employment, they could escape amidst the darkness of the night. There could be no escape for those poor wretches, stripped in their bed; none for that aged woman, who could not take herself away from among the guns and rocks of her pursuers; none for those poor children; none, indeed, for the father of the family, upon whom the ten would come in his lair. If his wife had threatened to tell, he must pay for his wife\u0027s garrulity. Pat Gilligan had suffered for some such offence, and it was but just that she and he and they should suffer also. But the three might have to suffer, also, in their turns, if they consented to subject themselves to so bloody an aristocracy. And therefore they stalked forth at night and went up to Kerrycullion, at the heels of the other party, and saw it all. Now, one after another, the six were killed, or all but killed, and then the three went back to their homes, resolved that they would have recourse to the other aristocracy. Between Galway and Cong and Kerrycullion, Hunter was kept going in these days, so as to obtain always the latest information for his master. For, though the neighbourhood of Morony Castle was now supposed to be quiet, and though the Captain was not at the moment on active service, Hunter was still allowed to remain with him. And, indeed, Captain Clayton\u0027s opinion was esteemed so highly, that, though he could do nothing, he was in truth on active service. \"They are sticking to their story, all through?\" he asked Hunter, or rather communicated the fact to Hunter for his benefit. \"Oh, yes! sir; they stick to their story. There is no doubt about them now. They can\u0027t go back.\" \"And that boy can talk now?\" \"Yes, sir; he can talk a little.\" \"And what he says agrees with the three men? There will be no more murders in that county, Hunter, or in County Galway either. When they have once learned to think it possible that one man may tell of another, there will be an end to that little game. But they must hang them of course.\" \"Oh, yes! sir,\" said Hunter. \"I\u0027d hang them myself; the whole ten of them, rather than keep them waiting.\" \"The trial is to be in Dublin. Before that day comes we shall find what they do about Lax. I don\u0027t suppose they will want me; or if they did, for the matter of that, I could go myself as well as ever.\" \"You could do nothing of the kind, Captain Clayton,\" said Edith, who was sitting there. \"It is absurd to hear you talk in such a way.\" \"I don\u0027t suppose he could just go up to Dublin, miss,\" said Hunter. \"Not for life and death?\" roared the sick man. \"I suppose you could for life and death,\" said Hunter,—with a little caution. \"For his own death he could,\" said Edith. \"But it\u0027s the death of other people that he is thinking of now.\" \"And you, what are you thinking of?\" \"To tell the truth, just at this moment I was thinking of yours. You are here under our keeping, and as long as you remain so, we are bound to do what we can to keep you from killing yourself; you ought to be in your bed.\" \"Tucked up all round,—and you ought to be giving me gruel.\" Then Hunter simpered and went away. He generally did go away when the love-scenes began. \"You could give one something which would cure me instantly.\" \"No, I could not! There are no such instant cures known in the medical world for a man who has had a hole right through him.\" \"That bullet will certainly be immortal.\" \"But you will not if you talk of going up to Dublin.\" \"Edith, a kiss would cure me.\" \"Captain Clayton, you are in circumstances which should prevent you from alluding to any such thing. I am here to nurse you, and I should not be insulted.\" \"That is true,\" he said. \"And if it be an insult to tell you what a kiss would do for me, I withdraw the word. But the feeling it would convey, that you had in truth given yourself to me, that you were really, really my own, would I think cure me, though a dozen bullets had gone through me.\" Then when Ada had come down, Edith went to her bedroom, and kissed the pillow, instead of him. Oh, if it might be granted to her to go to him, and frankly to confess, that she was all, all his own! And she felt, as days went on, she would have to yield, though honour still told her that she should never do so.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2744/75585.html","bookId":1377,"book":{"id":1377,"title":"The Landleaguers","description":"简介： In the year 1850 the two estates of Ballintubber and Morony were sold to Mr. Philip Jones, under the Estates Court, which had then been established.
