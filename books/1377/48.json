{"id":11453,"no":48,"title":"CHAPTER XLVIII. THE NEW ARISTOCRACY FAILS.","content":"From this moment the mystery of the new aristocracy began to fade away, and get itself abolished. Men and women began to feel that there might be something worse in store for them than the old course of policemen, juries, and judges. It had seemed, at first, as though these evil things could be brought to an end, and silenced altogether as far as their blessed country was concerned. A time was coming in which everyone was to do as he pleased, without any fear that another should tell of him. Though a man should be seen in the broad daylight cutting the tails off half a score of oxen it would be recognised in the neighbourhood as no more than a fair act of vengeance, and nothing should be told of the deed, let the policemen busy themselves as they might. And the beauty of the system consisted in the fact that the fear of telling was brought home to the minds of all men, women, and children. Though it was certain that a woman had seen a cow\u0027s tail mangled, though it could be proved beyond all doubt that she was in the field when the deed was done, yet if she held her peace no punishment would await her. The policeman and the magistrate could do nothing to her. But Thady O\u0027Leary, the man who had cut a cow\u0027s tail off, could certainly punish her. If nothing else were done she could be boycotted, or, in other words, not allowed to buy or sell the necessaries of life. Or she could herself be murdered, as had happened to Pat Gilligan. The whole thing had seemed to run so smoothly! \\n\\n \\n\\n But now there had come, or would soon come, a change o\u0027er the spirit of the dream. The murder of Pat Gilligan, though it had made one in the necessary sequence of events, one act in the course of the drama which, as a whole, had appeared to be so perfect, seemed to them all to have about it something terrible. No one knew what offence Pat Gilligan had given, or why he had been condemned. Each man began to tremble as he thought that he too might be a Pat Gilligan, and each woman that she might be a Mrs. Kelly. It was better to go back to the police and the magistrates than this! \\n\\n \\n\\n I do not know that we need lean too heavily on the stupidity of the country\u0027s side in not having perceived that this would be so. The country\u0027s side is very slow in perceiving the course which things will take. These ten murderers had been brought together, each from fear of the others; and they must have felt that though they were ten,—a number so great when they considered the employment on which they were engaged as to cause horror to the minds of all of them,—the ten could not include all who should have been included. Had the other three been taken in, if that were possible, how much better it would have been! But the desire for murder had not gone so far,—its beauty had not been so perfectly acknowledged as to make it even yet possible to comprise a whole parish in destroying one family. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then the three had seen that the whole scheme, the mystery of the thing, the very plan upon which it was founded, must be broken down and thrown to the winds. And we can imagine that, when the idea first came upon the minds of those three, that the entire family of the Kellys was to be sacrificed to stop the tongue of one talkative old woman, a horror must have fallen upon them as they recognised the duty which was incumbent on them. The duty of saving those six unfortunates they did not recognise. They could not screw themselves up to the necessary pitch of courage to enable them to enter in among loaded pistols and black-visaged murderers. The two women and the children had to die, though the three men were so close to them; so close as to have been certainly able to save them, or some of them, had they rushed into the cabin and created the confusion of another advent. To this they could not bring themselves, for are not the murderers armed? But an awful horror must have crept round their minds as they thought of the self-imposed task they had undertaken. They waited until the murders had been completed, and then they went back home and told the police. \\n\\n \\n\\n From this moment the mystery by which murders in County Galway and elsewhere were for a short period protected was over in Ireland. Men have not seen, as yet, how much more lovely it is to tell frankly all that has been done, to give openly such evidence as a man may have to police magistrates and justices of the peace, than to keep anything wrapped within his own bosom. The charm of such outspoken truth does not reconcile itself at once to the untrained mind; but the fact of the loveliness does gradually creep in, and the hideous ugliness of the other venture. On the minds of those men of Kerrycullion something of the ugliness and something of the loveliness must have made itself apparent. And when this had been done it was not probable that a return to the utter ugliness of the lie should be possible. Whether the ten be hanged,—to the intense satisfaction of Hunter and his master,—or some fewer number, such as may suffice the mitigated desire for revenge which at present is burning in the breasts of men, the thing will have been done, and the mystery with all its beauty will have passed away. \\n\\n \\n\\n At Castle Morony the beginning of the passing away of the mystery was hailed with great delight. It took place in this wise. A little girl who had been brought up there in the kitchen, and had reached the age of fifteen under the eyes of Ada and Edith,—a slip of a girl, whose feet our two girls had begun to trammel with shoes and stockings, and who was old enough to be proud of the finery though she could not bear the confinement,—had gone under the system of boycotting, when all the other servants had gone also. Peter, who was very stern in his discipline to the younger people, had caught hold of her before she went, and had brought her to Mr. Jones, recommending that at any rate her dress should be stripped from her back, and her shoes and stockings from her feet. \"If you war to wallop her, sir, into the bargain, it would be a good deed done,\" Peter had said to his master. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why should I wallop her for leaving my service?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She ain\u0027t guv\u0027 no notice,\" said the indignant Peter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And if I were to wallop you because you had taken it into your stupid head to leave me at a moment\u0027s notice, should I be justified in doing so?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There is differences,\" said Peter, drawing himself up. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are stronger, you mean, and Feemy Carroll is weak. Let her go her own gait as she pleases. How am I to take upon myself to say that she is not right to go? And for the shoes and stockings, let them go with her, and the dress also, if I am supposed to have any property in it. Fancy a Landleaguer in Parliament asking an indignant question as to my detaining forcibly an unwilling female servant. Let them all go; the sooner we learn to serve ourselves the better for us. I suppose you will go too before long.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This had been unkind, and Peter had made a speech in which he had said so. But the little affair had taken place in the beginning of the boycotting disarrangements, and Mr. Jones had been bitter in spirit. Now the girls had shown how deftly they could do the work, and had begun to talk pleasantly how well they could manage to save the wages and the food. \"It\u0027s my food you\u0027ll have to save, and my wages,\" said Captain Clayton. But this had been before he had a hole driven through him, and he was only awed by a frown. \\n\\n \\n\\n But now news was brought in that Feemy had crept in at the back door. \"Drat her imperence,\" said Peter, who brought in the news. \"It\u0027s like her ways to come when she can\u0027t get a morsel of wholesome food elsewhere.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Then Ada and Edith had rushed off to lay hold of the delinquent, who had indeed left a feeling in the hearts of her mistresses of some love for her little foibles. \"Oh! Feemy, so you\u0027ve come back again,\" said Ada, \"and you\u0027ve grown so big!\" But Feemy cowered and said not a word. \"What have you been doing all the time?\" said Edith. \"Miss Ada and I have had to clean out all the pots and all the pans, and all the gridirons, though for the matter of that there has been very little to cook on them.\" Then Ada asked the girl whether she intended to come back to her old place. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If I\u0027m let,\" said the girl, bursting into tears. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where are the shoes and stockings?\" said Ada. \\n\\n \\n\\n But the girl only wept. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course you shall come back, shoes or no shoes. I suppose times have been too hard with you at home to think much of shoes or stockings. Since your poor cousin was shot in Galway court-house,\"—for Feemy was a cousin of the tribe of Carrolls,—\"I fear it hasn\u0027t gone very well with you all.\" But to this Feemy had only answered by renewed sobs. She had, however, from that moment taken up her residence as of yore in the old house, and had gone about her business just as though no boycotting edict had been pronounced against Castle Morony. \\n\\n \\n\\n And gradually the other servants had returned, falling back into their places almost without a word spoken. One boy, who had in former days looked after the cows, absolutely did come and drive them in to be milked one morning without saying a word. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And who are you, you young deevil?\" said Peter to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m just Larry O\u0027Brien.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And what business have you here?\" said Peter. \"How many months ago is it since last year you took yourself off without even a word said to man or woman? Who wants you back again now, I wonder?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The boy, who had grown half-way to a man since he had taken his departure, made no further answer, but went on with the milking of his cows. \\n\\n \\n\\n And the old cook came back again from Galway, though she came after the writing of a letter which must have taken her long to compose, and the saying of many words. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Honoured Miss,\" the letter went, \"I\u0027ve been at Peter Corcoran\u0027s doing work any time these twelve months. And glad I\u0027ve been to find a hole to creep into. But Peter Corcoran\u0027s house isn\u0027t like Castle Morony, and so I\u0027ve told him scores of times. But Peter is one of them Landleaguers, and is like to be bruk\u0027, horse, foot, and dragoons, bekaise he wouldn\u0027t serve the gentry. May the deevil go along with him, and with his pollytiks. Sure you know, miss, they wouldn\u0027t let me stay at Castle Morony. Wasn\u0027t one side in pollitiks the same as another to an old woman like me, who only wants to \u0027arn her bit and her sup? I don\u0027t care the vally of a tobacco-pipe for none of them now. So if the squire would take me back again, may God bless him for iver and iver, say I.\" Then this letter was signed Judy Corcoran,—for she too was of the family of the Corcorans,—and became the matter for many arrangements, in the course of which she once more was put into office as cook at Castle Morony. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then Edith wrote the following letter to her friend Rachel, who still remained in London, partly because of her health and partly because her father had not yet quite settled his political affairs. But that shall be explained in another chapter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Dearest Rachel, \\n\\n \\n\\n Here we are beginning to see daylight, after having been buried in Cimmerian darkness for the best part of two years. I never thought how possible it would be to get along without servants to look after us, and how much of the pleasures of life might come without any of its comforts. Ada and I for many months have made every bed that has been slept in in the house, till we have come to think that the making of beds is the proper employment for ladies. And every bit of food has been cooked by us, till that too has become ladylike in our eyes. And it has been done for papa, who has, I think, liked his bed and his dinner all the better, because they have passed through his daughters\u0027 hands. But, dear papa! I\u0027m afraid he has not borne the Cimmerian darkness as well as have we, who have been young enough to look forward to the return of something better. \\n\\n \\n\\n What am I to say to you about Frank, who will not talk much of your perfections, though he is always thinking of them? I believe he writes to you constantly, though what he says, or of what nature it is, I can only guess. I presume he does not send many messages to Lord Castlewell, who, however, as far as I can see, has behaved beautifully. What more can a girl want than to have a lord to fall in love with her, and to give her up just as her inclination may declare itself? \\n\\n \\n\\n What I write for now, specially, is to add a word to what I presume Frank may have said in one of his letters. Papa says that neither you nor Mr. O\u0027Mahony are to think of leaving this side of the water without coming down to Castle Morony. We have got a cook now, and a cow-boy. What more can you want? And old Peter is here still, always talking about the infinite things which he has done for the Jones family. Joking apart, you must of course come and see us again once before you start for New York. Is Frank to go with you? That is a question to which we can get no answer at all from Frank himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n In your last you asked me about my affairs. Dear girl, I have no affairs. I am in such a position that it is impossible for me to have what you would call affairs. Between you and Frank everything is settled. Between me and the man to whom you allude there is nothing settled,—except that there is no ground for settlement. He must go one way and I another. It is very sad, you will say. I, however, have done it for myself and I must bear the burden. \\n\\n \\n\\n Yours always lovingly, \\n\\n \\n\\n Edith. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2744/75586.html","bookId":1377,"book":{"id":1377,"title":"The Landleaguers","description":"简介： In the year 1850 the two estates of Ballintubber and Morony were sold to Mr. Philip Jones, under the Estates Court, which had then been established.
