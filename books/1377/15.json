{"id":11420,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XV. CAPTAIN YORKE CLAYTON.","content":"At this period of our story much had already been said in the outside world as to flooding the meadows of Ballintubber. Like other outrages of the same kind, it had not at first been noticed otherwise than in the immediate neighbourhood; and though a terrible injury had been inflicted, equal in value to the loss of five or six hundred pounds, it had seemed as though it would pass away unnoticed, simply because Mr. Jones had lacked evidence to bring it home to any guilty party. But gradually it had become known that Pat Carroll had been the sinner, and the causes also which had brought about the crime were known. It was known that Pat Carroll had joined the Landleaguers in the neighbouring county of Mayo with great violence, and that he had made a threat that he would pay no further rent to his landlord. The days of the no-rent manifestation had not yet come, as the obnoxious Members of Parliament were not yet in prison; but no-rent was already firmly fixed in the minds of many men, about to lead in the process of time to \"Arrears Bills,\" and other abominations of injustice. And among those conspicuous in the West, who were ready to seize fortune by the forelock, was Mr. Pat Carroll. In this way his name had come forward, and inquiries were made of Mr. Jones which distressed him much. For though he was ready to sacrifice his meadows, and his tenant, and his rent, he was most unwilling to do it if he should be called upon at the same time to sacrifice his boy\u0027s character for loyalty. There had been a man stationed at Castlerea for some months past, who in celebrity had almost beaten the notorious Pat Carroll. This was one Captain Yorke Clayton, who for nearly twelve months had been in the County Mayo. It was supposed that he had first shown himself there as a constabulary officer, and had then very suddenly been appointed resident magistrate. Why he was Captain nobody knew. It was the fact, indeed, that he had been employed as adjutant in a volunteer regiment in England, having gone over there from the police force in the north of Ireland. His title had gone with him by no fault or no virtue of his own, and he had blossomed forth to the world of Connaught as Captain Clayton before he knew why he was about to become famous. Famous, however, he did become. He had two attributes which, if Fortune helps, may serve to make any man famous. They were recklessness of life and devotion to an idea. If Fortune do not help, recklessness of life amidst such dangers as those which surrounded Captain Clayton will soon bring a man to his end, so that there will be no question of fame. But we see men occasionally who seem to find it impossible to encounter death. It is not at all probable that this man wished to die. Life seemed to him to be pleasant enough: he was no forlorn lover; he had fairly good health and strength; people said of him that he had small but comfortable private means; he was remarkable among all men for his good looks; and he lacked nothing necessary to make life happy. But he appeared to be always in a hurry to leave it. A hundred men in Mayo had sworn that he should die. This was told to him very freely; but he had only laughed at it, and was generally called \"the woodcock,\" as he rode about among his daily employments. The ordinary life of a woodcock calls upon him to be shot at; but yet a woodcock is not an easy bird to hit. Then there was his devotion to an idea! I will not call it loyalty, lest I should seem to praise the man too vehemently for that which probably was simply an instinct in his own heart. He lived upon his hatred of a Landleaguer. It was probably some conviction on his own part that the original Landleaguer had come from New York, which produced this feeling. And it must be acknowledged of him with reference to the lower order of Landleaguers that he did admit in his mind a possibility that they were curable. There were to him Landleaguers and Landleaguers; but the Landleaguer whom Captain Yorke Clayton hated with the bitterest prejudice was the Landleaguing Member of Parliament. Some of his worst enemies believed that he might be detected in breaking out into illegal expressions of hatred, or, more unfortunately still, into illegal acts, and that so the Government might be compelled to dismiss him with disgrace. Others, his warmest friends, hoped that by such a process his life might be eventually saved. But for the present Captain Yorke Clayton had saved both his character and his neck, to the great surprise both of those who loved him and the reverse. He had lately been appointed Joint Resident Magistrate for Galway, Mayo, and Roscommon, and had removed his residence to Galway. To him also had Pat Carroll become intimately known, and to him the floods of Ballintubber were a peculiar case. It was one great desire of his heart to have Pat Carroll incarcerated as a penal felon. He did not very often express himself on this subject, but Pat Carroll knew well the nature of his wishes. \"A thundering bloody rapparee\" was the name by which Carroll delighted to call him. But Carroll was one who exercised none of that control over his own tongue for which Captain Clayton was said to be so conspicuous. During the last month Mr. Jones had seen Captain Clayton more than once at Galway, and on one occasion he had come down to Morony Castle attended by a man who was supposed to travel as his servant, but who was known by all the world to be a policeman in disguise. For Captain Clayton had been strictly forbidden by the authorities of the Castle to travel without such a companion; and an attempt had already been made to have him dismissed for disobedience to these orders. Captain Clayton, when he had been at Morony Castle, had treated Flory with great kindness, declining to cross-question him at all. \"I would endeavour to save him from these gentlemen,\" he had said to his father. \"I don\u0027t quite think that we understand what is going on within his mind;\" but this had been before the conversation last mentioned which had taken place between Flory and his sisters. Now he was to come again, and make further inquiry, and meet half-a-dozen policemen from the neighbourhood. But Florian had as yet but half confessed, and almost hoped that Captain Clayton would appear among them as his friend. The girls, to tell the truth, had been much taken with the appearance of the gallant Captain. It seems to be almost a shame to tell the truth of what modest girls may think of any man whom they may chance to meet. They would never tell it to themselves. Even two sisters can hardly do so. And when the man comes before them, just for once or twice, to be judged and thought of at a single interview, the girl,—such as were these girls,—can hardly tell it to herself. \"He is manly and brave, and has so much to say for himself, and is so good-looking, that what can any girl who has her heart at her own disposal wish for better than such a lover?\" It would have been quite impossible that either of Mr. Jones\u0027s daughters could ever have so whispered to herself. But was it not natural that such an unwhispered thought should have passed through the mind of Ada—Ada the beautiful, Ada the sentimental, Ada the young lady who certainly was in want of a lover? \"He is very nice, certainly,\" said Ada, allowing herself not another word, to her sister. \"But what is the good of a man being nice when he is a \u0027woodcock\u0027?\" said Edith. \"Everybody says that his destiny is before him. I daresay he is nice, but what\u0027s the use?\" \"You don\u0027t mean to say that you think he\u0027ll be killed?\" said Ada. \"I do, and I mean to say that if I were a man, it might be that I should have to be killed too. A man has to run his chance, and if he falls into such a position as this, of course he must put up with it. I don\u0027t mean to say that I don\u0027t like him the better for it.\" \"Why does he not go away and leave the horrid country?\" said Ada. \"Because the more brave men that go away the more horrid the country will become. And then I think a man is always the happier if he has something really to think of. Such a one as Captain Clayton does not want to go to balls.\" \"I suppose not,\" said Ada plaintively, as though she thought it a thousand pities that Captain Clayton should not want to go to balls. \"Such a man,\" said Edith with an air of firmness, \"finds a woman when he wants to marry, who will suit him,—and then he marries her. There is no necessity for any balls there.\" \"Then he ought not to dance at all. Such a man ought not to want to get married.\" \"Not if he means to be killed out of hand,\" said Edith. \"The possible young woman must be left to judge of that. I shouldn\u0027t like to marry a \u0027woodcock,\u0027 however much I might admire him. I do think it well that there should be such men as Captain Clayton. I feel that if I were a man I ought to wish to be one myself. But I am sure I should feel that I oughtn\u0027t to ask a girl to share the world with me. Fancy marrying a man merely to be left a sorrowing widow! It is part of the horror of his business that he shouldn\u0027t even venture to dance, lest some poor female should be captivated.\" \"A girl might be captivated without dancing,\" said Ada. \"I don\u0027t mean to say that such a man should absolutely tie himself up in a bag so that no poor female should run any possible danger, but he oughtn\u0027t to encourage such risks. To tell the truth, I don\u0027t think that Captain Clayton does.\" Ada that afternoon thought a great deal of the position,—not, of course, in reference to herself. Was it proper that such a man as Captain Yorke Clayton should abstain from falling in love with a girl, or even from allowing a girl to fall in love with him because he was in danger of being shot? It was certainly a difficult question. Was any man to be debarred from the pleasures, and incidents, and natural excitements of a man\u0027s life because of the possible dangers which might possibly happen to a possible young woman? Looking at the matter all round, Ada did not see that the man could help himself unless he were to be shut up in a bag, as Edith had said, so as to prevent a young woman from falling in love with him. Although he were a \"woodcock,\" the thing must go on in its own natural course. If misfortunes did come, why misfortunes must come. It was the same thing with any soldier or any sailor. If she were to fall in love with some officer,—for the supposition in its vague, undefined form was admissible even to poor Ada\u0027s imagination,—she would not be debarred from marrying him merely by the fact that he would have to go to the wars. Of course, as regarded Captain Yorke Clayton, this was merely a speculation. He might be engaged to some other girl already for anything she knew;—\"or cared,\" as she told herself with more or less of truth. Captain Yorke Clayton came down by the boat that afternoon to Morony Castle, Frank Jones having started for London two or three days before. He reached the pier at about four o\u0027clock, accompanied by his faithful follower, and was there met by Mr. Jones himself, who walked up with him to the Castle. There was a short cut across the fields to Mr. Jones\u0027s house; and as they left the road about a furlong up from the pier, they were surrounded by the waters which Mr. Carroll had let in upon the Ballintubber meadows. \"You won\u0027t mind my fellow coming with us?\" said Captain Clayton. \"\u0027Your fellow,\u0027 as you call him, is more than welcome. I came across this way because some of Pat Carroll\u0027s friends may be out on the high road. If they fire half-a-dozen rifles from behind a wall at your luggage, they won\u0027t do so much harm as if they shot at yourself.\" \"There won\u0027t be any shooting here,\" said Clayton, shaking his head, \"he\u0027s not had time to get a stranger down and pay him. They always require two or three days\u0027 notice for that work; and there isn\u0027t a wall about the place. You\u0027re not giving Mr. Pat Carroll a fair chance for his friends. I could dodge them always with perfect security by myself, only the beaks up in Dublin have given a strict order. As they pay for the pistols, I am bound to carry them.\" Then he lifted up the lappets of his coat and waistcoat, and showed half-a-dozen pistols stuck into his girdle. \"Our friend there has got as many more.\" \"I have a couple myself,\" said Mr. Jones, indicating their whereabouts, and showing that he was not as yet so used to carry them, as to have provided himself with a belt for the purpose. Then they walked on, chatting indifferently about the Landleaguers till they reached the Castle. \"The people are not cowards,\" Captain Clayton had said. \"I believe that men do become cowards when they are tempted to become liars by getting into Parliament. An Irishman of a certain class does at any rate. But those fellows, if they were put into a regiment, would fight like grim death. That man there,\" and he pointed back over his shoulder, \"is as brave a fellow as I ever came across in my life. I don\u0027t think that he would hesitate a moment in attacking three or four men armed with revolvers. And gold wouldn\u0027t induce him to be false to me. But if Mr. Pat Carroll had by chance got hold of him before he had come my way, he might have been the very man to shoot you or me from behind a wall, with a bit of black crape on his face. What\u0027s the reason of it? I love that man as my brother, but I might have hated him as the very devil.\" \"The force of example, sir,\" said Mr. Jones, as he led the way into the quiet, modern residence which rejoiced to call itself Morony Castle. \"What are we to do about this boy?\" said Mr. Jones, when they had seated themselves in his study. \"Are you friends with him yet?\" \"No; I declared to his sisters that I would not sit down to table with him till he had told the truth, and I have kept my word.\" \"How does he bear it?\" \"But badly,\" said the father. \"It has told upon him very much. He complains to his sister that I have utterly cast him off.\" \"It is the oddest case I ever heard of in my life,\" said the Captain. \"I suppose his change of religion has been at the bottom of it—that and the machinations of the priest down at Headford. When we recollect that there must have been quite a crowd of people looking on all the while, it does seem odd that we should be unable to get a single witness to tell the truth, knowing, as we do, that this lad was there. If he would only name two who were certainly there, and who certainly saw the deed done, that would be enough; for the people are not, in themselves, hostile to you.\" \"You know he has owned that he did see it,\" said the father. \"And he has acknowledged that Pat Carroll was there, though he has never mentioned the man\u0027s name. His sisters have told him that I will not be satisfied unless I hear him declare that Pat Carroll was one of the offenders.\" \"Let us have him in, sir, if you don\u0027t mind.\" \"Just as he is?\" \"I should say so. Or let the young ladies come with him, if you do not object. Which of them has been most with him since your edict went forth?\" Mr. Jones declared that Edith had been most with her brother, and the order went forth that Edith and Florian should be summoned into the apartment. Ada and Edith were together when the order came. Edith was to go down and present herself before Captain Yorke Clayton. \"Mercy me!\" said Edith jumping up, \"I hope they won\u0027t shoot at him through the window whilst I am there.\" \"Oh! Edith, how can you think of such a thing?\" \"It would be very unpleasant if some assassin were to take my back hair for Captain Clayton\u0027s brown head. They\u0027re very nearly the same colour.\" And Edith prepared to leave the room, hearing her brother\u0027s slow, heavy step as he passed before the door. \"Won\u0027t you go first and brush your hair?\" said Ada; \"and do put a ribbon on your neck.\" \"I\u0027ll do nothing of the kind. It would be a sheer man?uvring to entrap a man who ought to be safeguarded against all such female wiles. Besides, I don\u0027t believe a bit that Captain Clayton would know the difference between a young lady with or without a ribbon. What evidence I can give;—that\u0027s the question.\" So saying, Edith descended to her father\u0027s room. She found Florian with his hand upon the door, and they both entered the room. I have said that Captain Clayton was a remarkably good-looking man, and I ought, perhaps, to give some explanation of the term when first introducing him to the reader in the presence of a lady who is intended to become the heroine of this story; but it must suffice that I have declared him to be good-looking, and that I add to that the fact that though he was thirty-five years old, he did not look to be more than five-and-twenty. The two peculiarities of his face were very light blue eyes, and very long moustachios. \"Florian and I have come to see the latter-day hero,\" said Edith laughing as she entered the room; \"though I know that you are so done up with pistols that no peaceable young woman ought to come near you.\" To this he made some sportive reply, and then before a minute had passed over their heads he had taken Florian by the hand.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2744/75553.html","bookId":1377,"book":{"id":1377,"title":"The Landleaguers","description":"简介： In the year 1850 the two estates of Ballintubber and Morony were sold to Mr. Philip Jones, under the Estates Court, which had then been established.
