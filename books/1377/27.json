{"id":11432,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER XXVII. HOW FUNDS WERE PROVIDED.","content":"Mr. Moss at this interview again pressed his loan of money upon poor Rachel. \n \n \"You cannot get on, my dear young lady, in this world without money. If you have spent your income hitherto, what do you mean to do till the end of November? At Covent Garden the salaries are all paid monthly.\" \n \n There was something so ineffably low and greasy in his tone of addressing her, that it was impossible to be surprised at the disgust which she expressed for him. \n \n \"Mr. Moss, I am not your dear young lady,\" she said. \n \n \"Would that you were! We should be as happy as the day is long. There would be no money troubles then.\" She could not fail to make comparisons between him and the English nobleman who had just left her, which left the Englishman infinitely superior; although, with the few thoughts she had given to him, she had already begun to doubt whether Lord Castlewell\u0027s morality stood very high. \"What will you do for money for the next three months? You cannot do without money,\" said Mr. Moss. \n \n \"I have already found a friend,\" said Rachel most imprudently. \n \n \"What! his lordship there?\" \n \n \"I am not bound to answer any such questions.\" \n \n \"But I know; I can see the game is all up if it has come to that. I am a fellow-workman, and there have been, and perhaps will be, many relations between us. A hundred pounds advanced here or there must be brought into the accounts sooner or later. That is honest; that will bear daylight; no young lady need be ashamed of that; even if you were Mrs. Jones you need not be ashamed of such a transaction.\" \n \n \"I am not Mrs. Jones,\" said Rachel in great anger. \n \n \"But if you were, Mr. Jones would have no ground of complaint, unless indeed on the score of extravagance. But a present from this lord!\" \n \n \"It is no present. It does not come from the lord; it comes from the funds of the theatre.\" \n \n \"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed Mr. Moss. \"Is that the little game with which he attempts to cajole you? How has he got his hand into the treasury of the theatre, so that he may be able to help you so conveniently? You have not got the money yet, I suppose?\" \n \n \"I have not got his money—which may be dangerous, or yours—which would certainly be more so. Though from neither of you could the bare money hurt me, if it were taken with an innocent heart. From you it would be a distress, an annoyance, a blister. From him it would be simply a loan either from himself or from the theatre with which he is connected. I may be mistaken, but I have imagined that it would come from the theatre; I will ascertain, and if it be not so, I will decline the loan.\" \n \n \"Do you not know his character? nor his mode of living, nor his dealing with actresses? You will not at any rate get credit for such innocence when you tell the story. Why;—he has come here to call upon you, and of course it is all over the theatre already that you are his mistress. I came in here to endeavour to save you; but I fear it is too late.\" \n \n \"Impudent scoundrel,\" said Rachel, jumping up and glaring at him. \n \n \"That is all very well, but I have endeavoured to save you. I would believe none of them when they told me that you would not be my wife because you were married to Mr. Jones. Nor would I believe them when they have told me since that you were not fit to be the wife of anyone.\" Rachel\u0027s hand went in among the folds of her dress, and returned with a dagger in it. Words had been said to her now which she swore to herself were unbearable. \"Yes; you are in a passion now;\" and as he said so, he contrived to get the round table with which the room was garnished between himself and her. \n \n \"It is true,\" she said, \"your words have been so base that I am no doubt angry.\" \n \n \"But if you knew it, I am endeavouring to save you. Imprudent as you have been I still wish to make you my wife.\" Here Rachel in her indignation spat upon the floor. \"Yes; I am anxious to make you an honest woman.\" \n \n \"You can make no woman honest. It is altogether beyond your power.\" \n \n \"It will be so when you have taken this lord\u0027s money.\" \n \n \"I have not at any rate taken yours. It is that which would disgrace me. Between this lord and me there has been no word that could do so.\" \n \n \"Will he make you his wife?\" \n \n \"Wife! No. He is married for aught that I know. He has spoken to me no word except about my profession. Nor shall you. Cannot a woman sing without being wife to any man?\" \n \n \"Ha, ha, yes indeed!\" \n \n She understood the scorn intended to be thrown on her line of life by his words, and was wretched to think that he was getting the better of her in conversation. \"I can sing and I need no husband.\" \n \n \"It is common with the friends of the lord that they do not generally rank very high in their profession. I have endeavoured to save you from this kind of thing, and see the return that I get! You will, however, soon have left us, and you will then find that to fill first place at \u0027The Embankment\u0027 is better than a second or a third at Covent Garden.\" \n \n During these hot words on both sides she had been standing at a pier-glass, arranging something in her dress intended to suit Moss\u0027s fancy upon the stage,—Moss who was about to enact her princely lover—and then she walked off without another word. She went through her part with all her usual vigour and charm, and so did he. Elmira also was more pathetic than ever, as the night was supposed to be something special, because a royal duke and his young bride were in the stage box. The plaudits given would have been tremendous only that the building was so small, and the grand quartette became such a masterpiece that there was half a column concerning it in the musical corner of the next morning\u0027s Daily Telephone. \"If that girl would only go as I\u0027d have her,\" said Mr. Moss to the most confidential of his theatrical friends, \"I\u0027d make her Mrs. Moss to-morrow, and her fame should be blazoned all over the world before twelve months had gone as Madame Moussa.\" \n \n But Rachel, though she was enabled so to overcome her rage as to remember only her theatrical passion when she was on the stage, spent the whole of the subsequent night in thinking over the difficulty into which she had brought herself by her imprudence. She understood to the full the meaning of all those innuendoes which Mr. Moss had provided for her; and she knew that though there was in them not a spark of truth as regarded herself, still they were so truth-like as to meet with acceptance, at any rate from all theatrical personages. She had gone to M. Le Gros for the money clearly as one of the theatrical company with which she was about to connect herself. M. Le Gros had, to her intelligence, distinctly though very courteously declined her request. It might be well that the company would accede to no such request; but M. Le Gros, in his questionable civility, had told the whole story to Lord Castlewell, who had immediately offered her a loan of ￡200 out of his own pocket. It had not occurred to her in the moment in which she had first read the words in the presence of Mahomet M. M. that such must necessarily be the case. Was it probable that Lord Castlewell should on his own behalf recover from the treasury of the theatre the sum of ￡200? And then the nature of this lord\u0027s character opened itself to her eyes in all the forms which Mr. Moss had intended that it should wear. A man did not lend a young lady ￡200 without meaning to secure for himself some reward. And as she thought of it all she remembered the kind of language in which she had spoken of her father. She had described him as an American in words which might so probably give this noble old roué a false impression as to his character. And yet she liked the noble old roué—liked him so infinitely better than she did Mr. Moss. M. Le Gros had betrayed her, or had, perhaps, said words leading to her betrayal; but still she greatly preferred M. Le Gros to Mr. Moss. \n \n She was safe as yet with this lord. Not a sparkle of his gold had she received. No doubt the story about the money would be spread about from her own telling of it. People would believe it because she herself had said so. But it was still within her power to take care that it should not be true. She did what was usual on such occasions. She abused the ill-feeling of the world which by the malignity of its suspicions would not scruple to drag her into the depths of misfortune, forgetting probably that her estimation of others was the same as others of her. She did not bethink herself that had another young lady at another theatre accepted a loan from an unmarried lord of such a character, she would have thought ill of that young lady. The world ought to be perfectly innocent in regard to her because she believed herself to be innocent; and Mr. Moss in expressing the opinions of others, and exposing to her the position in which she had placed herself, had simply proved himself to be the blackest of human beings. \n \n But it was necessary that she should at once do something to whitewash her own character in her own esteem. This lord had declared that he himself would call, and she was at first minded to wait till he did so, and then to hand back to him the cheque which she believed that he would bring, and to assure him that under altered circumstances it would not be wanted. But she felt that it would best become her to write to him openly, and to explain the circumstances which had led to his offering the loan. \"There is nothing like being straightforward,\" she said to herself, \"and if he does not choose to believe me, that is his fault.\" So she took up her pen, and wrote quickly, to the following effect: \n \n \n My dear Lord Castlewell, \n \n I want to tell you that I do not wish to have the ￡200 which you were good enough to say that you would lend me. Indeed I cannot take it under any circumstances. I must explain to you all about it, if your lordship pleases. I had intended to ask M. Le Gros to get the theatre people to advance me some small sum on my future engagement, and I had not thought how impossible it was that they should do so, as of course I might die before I had sung a single note. I never dreamed of coming to you, whose lordship\u0027s name I had not even heard in my ignorance. Then M. Le Gros spoke to you, and you came and made your proposition in the most good-natured way in the world. I was such a fool as not to see that the money must of course come from yourself. \n \n Mr. Moss has enlightened me, and has made me understand that no respectable young woman would accept a loan of money from you without blemish to her character. Mr. Moss, whom I do not in the least like, has been right in this. I should be very sorry if you should be taught to think evil of me before I go to your theatre; or indeed, if I do not go at all. I am not up to all these things, and I suppose I ought to have consulted my father the moment I got your little note. Pray do not take any further notice of it. \n \n I am, very faithfully, \n Your lordship\u0027s humble servant, \n \n Rachel O\u0027Mahony. \n \n \n Then there was added a postscript: \"Your note has just come and I return the cheque.\" As chance would have it the cheque had come just as Rachel had finished her letter, and with the cheque there had been a short scrawl as follows: \"I send the money as settled, and will call to-morrow.\" \n \n Whatever may have been Lord Castlewell\u0027s general sins among actresses and actors, his feelings hitherto in regard to Miss O\u0027Mahony had not done him discredit. He had already heard her name frequently when he had seen her in her little carriage before the steps of Covent Garden Theatre, and had heard her sing at \"The Embankment.\" Her voice and tone and feeling had enchanted him as he had wont to be enchanted by new singers of high quality, and he had been greatly struck by the brightness of her beauty. When M. Le Gros had told him of her little wants, he had perceived at once her innocence, and had determined to relieve her wants. Then, when she had told him of her father, and had explained to him the kind of terms on which they lived together, he was sure that she was pure as snow. But she was very lovely, and he could not undertake to answer for what feelings might spring up in her bosom. Now he had received this letter, and every word of it spoke to him in her favour. He took, therefore, a little trouble, and calling upon her the next morning at her lodgings, found her seated with Mr. O\u0027Mahony. \n \n \"Father,\" she said, when the lord was ushered into the room, \"this is Lord Castlewell. Lord Castlewell, this is my father.\" \n \n Then she sat down, leaving the two to begin the conversation as they might best please. She had told her father nothing about the money, simply explaining that on the steps of the theatre she had met the lord, who was one of its proprietors. \n \n \"Lord Castlewell,\" said Mr. O\u0027Mahony, \"I am very proud,\" then he bowed. \"I know very little about stage affairs, but I am confident that my daughter will do her duty to the best of her ability.\" \n \n \"Not more so than I am,\" said Lord Castlewell, upon which Mr. O\u0027Mahony bowed again. \"You have heard about this little contretemps about the money.\" \n \n \"Not a word,\" said Mr. O\u0027Mahony, shaking his head. \n \n \"Nor of the terrible character which has been given you by your daughter?\" \n \n \"That I can well understand,\" said Mr. O\u0027Mahony. \n \n \"She says that you wish to abolish all the English aristocracy.\" \n \n \"Most of them,\" said Mr. O\u0027Mahony. \"Peradventure ten shall be found honest, and I will not destroy them for ten\u0027s sake; but I doubt whether there be one.\" \n \n \"I should be grieved to think that you were the judge.\" \n \n \"And so should I,\" said Mr. O\u0027Mahony. \"It is so easy to utter curses when no power accompanies the utterances. The Lord must have found it uncomfortable in regard to Sodom. I can spit out all my fury against English vices and British greed without suffering one pang at my heart. What is this that you were saying about Rachel and her money?\" \n \n \"She is in a little trouble about cash at the present moment.\" \n \n \"Not a doubt about it.\" \n \n \"And I have offered to lend her a trifle—￡200 or so, just till she can work it off up at the theatre there.\" \n \n \"Then there is one of the ten at any rate,\" said Mr. O\u0027Mahony. \n \n \"Meaning me?\" asked the lord. \n \n \"Just so. Lending us ￡200, when neither of us have a shilling in our pocket, is a very good deed. Don\u0027t you think so, Rachel?\" \n \n \"No,\" said Rachel. \"Lord Castlewell is not a fit person to lend me ￡200 out of his pocket, and I will not have it.\" \n \n \"I did not know,\" said Mr. O\u0027Mahony. \n \n \"You never know anything, you are such a dear, innocent old father.\" \n \n \"There\u0027s an end of it then,\" said he, addressing himself to the lord. He did not look in the least annoyed because his daughter had refused to take the loan, nor had he shown the slightest feeling of any impropriety when there was a question as to her accepting it. \n \n \"Of course I cannot force it upon you,\" said Lord Castlewell. \n \n \"No; a lord cannot do that, even in this country, where lords go for so much. But we are not a whit the less obliged to your lordship. There are proprieties and improprieties which I don\u0027t understand. Rachel knows all about them. Such a knowledge comes to a girl naturally, and she chooses either the one or the other, according to her nature. Rachel is a dragon of propriety.\" \n \n \"Father, you are a goose,\" said Rachel. \n \n \"I am telling his lordship the truth. There is some reason why you should not take the money, and you won\u0027t take it. I think it very hard that I should not have been allowed to earn it.\" \n \n \"Why were you not allowed?\" asked the lord. \n \n \"Lest the people should be persuaded to rise up against you lords,—which they very soon would do,—and will do. You are right in your generation. The people were paying twenty-five cents a night to come and hear me, and so I was informed that I must not speak to them any more. I had been silenced in Galway before; but then I had spoken about your Queen.\" \n \n \"We can\u0027t endure that, you know.\" \n \n \"So I learn. She\u0027s a holy of holies. But I promised to say nothing further about her, and I haven\u0027t. I was talking about your Speaker of the House of Commons.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s nearly as bad,\" said Lord Castlewell, shaking his head. \n \n \"A second-rate holy of holies. When I said that he ought to obey certain rules which had been laid down for his guidance, I was told to walk out. \u0027What may I talk about?\u0027 I asked. Then the policeman told me \u0027the weather.\u0027 Even an Englishman is not stupid enough to pay twenty-five cents for that. I am only telling you this to explain why we are so impecunious.\" \n \n \"The policeman won\u0027t prevent my lending you ￡200.\" \n \n \"Won\u0027t he now? There\u0027s no knowing what a policeman can\u0027t do in this country. They are very good-natured, all the same.\" \n \n Then Lord Castlewell turned to Rachel, and asked her whether her suspicions would go so far as to interfere between him and her father. \"It is because I am a pretty girl that you are going to do it,\" she said, frowning, \"or because you pretend to think so.\" Here the father broke out into a laugh, and the lord followed him. \"You had better keep your money to yourself, my lord. You never can have used it with less chance of getting any return.\" This interview, however, was ended by the acceptance of a cheque from Lord Castlewell for ￡200, payable to the order of Gerald O\u0027Mahony. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2744/75565.html","bookId":1377,"book":{"id":1377,"title":"The Landleaguers","description":"简介： In the year 1850 the two estates of Ballintubber and Morony were sold to Mr. Philip Jones, under the Estates Court, which had then been established.
