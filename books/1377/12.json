{"id":11417,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XII. \"DON\u0027T HATE HIM, ADA.\"","content":"Among those who had gone as far as Mr. Lambert\u0027s, but had not proceeded further, had been Frank Jones. He had heard and seen what has been narrated, and was as much impressed as others with the condition of the country. The populace generally—for so it had seemed to be—had risen en masse to put down the amusement of the gentry, and there had been a secret conspiracy, so that they had been able to do the same thing in different parts of the county. Frank, as he rode back to Morony Castle, a long way from Mr. Lambert\u0027s covert, was very melancholy in his mind. The persecution of Mahomet M. Moss and of the Landleaguers together was almost too much for him. When he got home his father also was melancholy, and the girls were melancholy. \"What sport have you had, Frank?\" said the father. But he asked the question in a melancholy tone, simply as being one which the son expects on returning from hunting. In this expectation Mr. Jones gave way. Frank shook his head, but did not utter a word. \"What do you mean by that?\" asked the father. \"The whole country is in arms.\" This, no doubt, was an exaggeration, as the only arms that had been brought to Moytubber on the occasion had been the pistol in Tom Daly\u0027s pocket. \"In arms?\" said Philip Jones. \"Well, yes! I call it so. I call men in arms, when they are prepared to carry out any illegal purpose by violence, and these men have done that all through the County Galway.\" \"What have they done?\" \"You know where the meet was; well, they drew Ballytowngal, and found no fox there. It was not expected, and nothing happened there. The people did not come into old Nick Bodkin\u0027s demesne, but we had heard by the time that we were there that we should come across a lot of Landleaguers at Moytubber. There they were as thick as bees round the covert, and there was one man who had the impudence to tell Tom Daly that draw where he might, he would draw in vain for a fox to-day in County Galway.\" \"Do you mean that there was a crowd?\" asked Mr. Jones. \"A crowd! Yes, all Claregalway seemed to have turned out. Claregalway is not much of a place, but everyone was there from Oranmore and from Athenry, and half the town from Galway city.\" This certainly was an exaggeration on the part of Frank, but was excused by his desire to impress his father with the real truth in the matter. \"I never saw half such a number of people by a covert side. But the truth was soon known. They had beat Moytubber, and kicked up such a row as the foxes in that gorse had never heard before. And they were not slow in obtaining their object.\" \"Their object was clear enough.\" \"They didn\u0027t intend that the hounds should hunt that day either at Moytubber or elsewhere. Daly did not put his hounds into the covert at all; but rode away as fast as his horse\u0027s legs could carry him to Kilcornan.\" \"That must be ten miles at least,\" said his father. \"Twenty, I should think. But we rode away at a hand-gallop, leaving the crowd behind us.\" This again was an exaggeration. \"But when we got to the covert at Kilcornan there was just the same sort of crowd, and just the same work had been on foot. The men there all told us that we need not expect to find a fox. A rumour had got about the field by this time that Tom Daly had a loaded pistol in his pocket. What he meant to do with it I don\u0027t know. He could have done no good without a regular massacre.\" \"Did he show his pistol?\" \"I didn\u0027t see it; but I do believe it was there. Some of the old fogies were awfully solemn about it.\" \"What was the end of it all?\" asked Edith, who together with her sister was now listening to Frank\u0027s narrative. \"You know Mr. Lambert\u0027s place on the road towards Gort. It\u0027s a long way off, and I\u0027m a little out of my latitude there. But I went as far as that, and found a bigger crowd than ever. They said that all Gort was there; but Tom having drawn the covert, went on, and swore that he wouldn\u0027t leave a place in all County Galway untried. He borrowed fresh horses, and went on with Barney Smith as grim as death. He is still drawing his covert somewhere.\" It was thus that Frank Jones told the story of that day\u0027s hunting. To his father\u0027s ears it sounded as being very ominous. He did not care much for hunting himself, nor would it much perplex him if the Landleaguers would confine themselves to this mode of operations. But as he heard of the crowds surrounding the coverts through the county, he thought also of his many acres still under water, by the operation of a man who had taken upon himself to be his enemy. And the whole morning had been spent in fruitless endeavours to make Florian tell the truth. The boy had remained surly, sullen, and silent. \"He will tell me at last,\" Edith had said to her father. But her father had said, that unless the truth were now told, he must allow the affair to go by. \"The time for dealing with the matter will be gone,\" he had said. \"Pat Carroll is going about the country as bold as brass, and says that he will fix his own rent; whereas I know, and all the tenants know, that he ought to be in Galway jail. There isn\u0027t a man on the estate who isn\u0027t certain that it was he, with five or six others, who let the waters in upon the meadows.\" \"Then why on earth cannot you make them tell?\" \"They say that they only think it,\" said Edith. \"The very best of them only think it,\" said Ada. \"And there is not one of them,\" said Mr. Jones, \"whom you could trust to put into a witness-box. To tell the truth, I do not see what right I have to ask them to go there. If I was to select a man,—or two, how can I say to them, \u0027forget yourself, forget your wife and children, encounter possible murder, and probable ruin, in order that I may get my revenge on this man\u0027?\" \"It is not revenge but justice,\" said Frank. \"It would be revenge to their minds. And if it came to pass that there was a man who would thus sacrifice himself to me, what must I do with him afterwards? Were I to send him to America with money, and take his land into my own hand, see what horrible things would be said of me. The sort of witness I want to back up others, who would then be made to come, is Florian.\" \"What would they do to him?\" asked Edith. \"I could send him to an English school for a couple of years, till all this should have passed by. I have thought of that.\" \"That, too, would cost money,\" said Ada. \"Of course it would cost money, but it would be forthcoming, rather than that the boy should be in danger. But the feeling, to me, as to the boy himself, comes uppermost. It is that he himself should have such a secret in his bosom, and keep it there, locked fast, in opposition to his own father. I want to get it out of him while he is yet a boy, so that his name shall not go abroad as one who, by such manifest falsehood, took part against his own father. It is the injury done to him, rather than the injury done to me.\" \"He has promised his priest that he will not tell,\" said Edith, making what excuse she could for her brother. \"He has not promised his priest,\" said Mr. Jones. \"He has made no promise to Father Malachi, of Ballintubber. If he has promised at all it is to that pestilent fellow at Headford. The curate at Headford is not his priest, and why should a promise made to any priest be more sacred than one made to another, unless it were made in confession? I cannot understand Florian. It seems as though he were anxious to take part with these wretches against his country, against his religion, and against his father. It is unintelligible to me that a boy of his age should, at the same time, be so precocious and so stupid. I have told him that I know him to be a liar, and that until he will tell the truth he shall not come into my presence.\" Having so spoken the father sat silent, while Frank went off to dress. It was felt by them all that a terrible decision had been come to in the family. A verdict had gone out and had pronounced Florian guilty. They had all gradually come to think that it was so. But now the judge had pronounced the doom. The lad was not to be allowed into his presence during the continuance of the present state of things. In the first place, how was he to be kept out of his father\u0027s presence? And the boy was one who would turn mutinous in spirit under such a command. The meaning of it was that he should not sit at table with his father. But, in accordance with the ways of the family, he had always done so. A separate breakfast must be provided for him, and a separate dinner. Then would there not be danger that he should be driven to look for his friends elsewhere? Would he not associate with Father Brosnan, or, worse again, with Pat Carroll? \"Ada,\" said Edith that night as they sat together, \"Florian must be made to confess.\" \"How make him?\" \"You and I must do it.\" \"That\u0027s all very well,\" said Ada, \"but how? You have been at him now for nine months, and have not moved him. He\u0027s the most obstinate boy, I think, that ever lived.\" \"Do you know, there is something in it all that makes me love him the better?\" said Edith. \"Is there? There is something in it that almost makes me hate him.\" \"Don\u0027t hate him, Ada—if you can help it. He has got some religious idea into his head. It is all stupid.\" \"It is beastly,\" said Ada. \"You may call it as you please,\" said the other, \"it is stupid and beastly. He is travelling altogether in a wrong direction, and is putting everybody concerned with him in immense trouble. It may be quite right that a person should be a Roman Catholic—or that he should be a Protestant; but before one turns from one to the other, one should be old enough to know something about it. It is very vexatious; but with Flory there is, I think, some idea of an idea. He has got it into his head that the Catholics are a downtrodden people, and therefore he will be one of them.\" \"That is such bosh,\" said Ada. \"It is so, to your thinking, but not to his. In loving him or hating him you\u0027ve got to love him or hate him as a boy. Of course it\u0027s wicked that a boy should lie,—or a man, or a woman, or a girl; but they do. I don\u0027t see why we are to turn against a boy of our own, when we know that other boys lie. He has got a notion into his head that he is doing quite right, because the priest has told him.\" \"He is doing quite wrong,\" said Ada. \"And now what are we to do about his breakfast? Papa says that he is not to be allowed to come into the room, and papa means it. You and I will have to breakfast with him and dine with him, first one and then the other.\" \"But papa will miss us.\" \"We must go through the ceremony of a second breakfast and a second dinner.\" This was the beginning of Edith\u0027s scheme. \"Of course it\u0027s a bore; all things are bores. This about the flood is the most terrible bore I ever knew. But I\u0027m not going to let Flory go to the devil without making an effort to save him. It would be going to the devil, if he were left alone in his present position.\" \"Papa will see that we don\u0027t eat anything.\" \"Of course he must be told. There never ought to be any secrets in anything. Of course he\u0027ll grow used to it, and won\u0027t expect us to sit there always and eat nothing. He thinks he\u0027s right, and perhaps he is. Flory will feel the weight of his displeasure; and if we talk to him we may persuade him.\" This state of things at Morony Castle was allowed to go on with few other words said upon the subject. The father became more and more gloomy, as the floods held their own upon the broad meadows. Pat Carroll had been before the magistrates at Headford, and had been discharged, as all evidence was lacking to connect him with the occurrence. Further effort none was made, and Pat Carroll went on in his course, swearing that not a shilling of rent should be paid by him in next March. \"The floods had done him a great injury,\" he said laughingly among his companions, \"so that it was unreasonable to expect that he should pay.\" It was true he had owed a half-year\u0027s rent last November; but then it had become customary with Mr. Jones\u0027s tenants to be allowed the indulgence of six months. No more at any rate would be said about rent till March should come. And now, superinduced upon this cause of misery, had come the tidings which had been spread everywhere through the county in regard to the Galway hunt. Tom Daly had gone on regularly with his meets, and had not indeed been stopped everywhere. His heart had been gladdened by a wonderful run which he had had from Carnlough. The people had not interfered there, and the day had been altogether propitious. Tom had for the moment been in high good humour; but the interruption had come again, and had been so repeated as to make him feel that his occupation was in truth gone. The gentry of the county had then held a meeting at Ballinasloe, and had decided that the hounds should be withdrawn for the remainder of the season. No one who has not ridden with the hounds regularly can understand the effect of such an order. There was no old woman with a turkey in her possession who did not feel herself thereby entitled to destroy the fox who came lurking about her poultry-yard. Nor was there a gentleman who owned a pheasant who did not feel himself animated in some degree by the same feeling. \"As there\u0027s to be an end of fox-hunting in County Galway, we can do what we like with our own coverts.\" \"I shall go in for shooting,\" Sir Nicholas Bodkin had been heard to say. But Black Tom Daly sat alone gloomily in his room at Ahaseragh, where it suited him still to be present and look after the hounds, and told himself that the occupation of his life was gone. Who would want to buy a horse even, now that the chief object for horses was at an end?","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2744/75550.html","bookId":1377,"book":{"id":1377,"title":"The Landleaguers","description":"简介： In the year 1850 the two estates of Ballintubber and Morony were sold to Mr. Philip Jones, under the Estates Court, which had then been established.
