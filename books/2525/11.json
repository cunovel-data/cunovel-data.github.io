Unless you want to wait for them to regroup and come back?\"\n Rider grabbed her outstretched hand and pulled to right himself, noting how easily she\u0027d helped him up. But he reserved comment until they had jogged back down the beach and locked the Jeep with them in it. He leaned his head on the steering wheel and let the tremors abate when his hands shook as he tried to put the key in the ignition.\n \"Sonofabitch! Don\u0027t do that again, okay? Enough to make a grown man piss himself. Shit!\"\n \"Everybody: status!\" Shabazz\u0027s voice bellowed through the radio.\n \"We\u0027re coming in,\" Damali said, her tone blase. \"We\u0027ll pick up Big Mike, unless he\u0027s okay till morning.\"\n \"Rider, the slayer\u0027s condition; your condition?\"\n Rider sat up slowly, wet sand and sea clinging to his body and clothes as he stared at Damali. Her expression was more peaceful, like the sudden onslaught of whatever had taken her over had passed. \"One of \u0027em got me from behind,\" he said. Strain made his voice sound tight, as he thought about the horrible possibility of being nicked. \"Check my back, D - I mighta got a scratch from a vamp. I think I\u0027m hit.\" He peered over his shoulder, grabbing at his shirt, panic making him scrabble at the wet cloth. \"Check me out, for real - I\u0027m hit!\"\n There was silence on the radio - all anyone could hear was static.\n \"They never nicked him,\" Damali said in an amused tone. \"That was me who grabbed him from behind and moved his head out of the way so I could throw my dagger without taking off his ear. Couldn\u0027t talk to him with a baby Isis between my teeth. Needed one hand to grab his slow ass and pull him out of harm\u0027s way.\" She slapped Rider on his shoulder and rubbed his spine as he pulled away with a sullen expression.\n \"They never broke the leather on his boots. I had his back. Madame Isis had mine. We\u0027re clean. Got two more - but two got away. One of them, the female, is headed for the beachfront properties... but police are up there. I wonder, maybe staking out one of Carlos\u0027s boys\u0027 residences?\"\n \"Come back to the compound, now!\" Marlene ordered. \"Mike will travel by day if they release Jose sometime tomorrow.\"\n \"I\u0027m cool,\" Mike said. \"Go back to base.\"\n \"She\u0027s not even breathing hard,\" Rider snapped, exasperated. \"And is now all smiles. This is bullshit.\"\n \"She got her run out,\" Shabazz said. \"The blood lust has passed. Bring baby-girl home.\"\n \u0026nbsp;\"Youare grounded, Miss Thang!\" Marlene walked in a circle as the rest of the team sat silently in the weapons room. \"And, don\u0027t you ever curse at me, ever! What was that, \u0027Fuck you, Marlene,\u0027 mess? Huh? I will kick your natural - \"\n \"Grounded? I\u0027m grown. What the hell - \"\n \"Don\u0027t you speak to me like that! And, everybody stop cursing!\" Marlene pointed at Rider who now occupied a stool. Outright fury burned in her eyes and her voice dropped to a lethal octave as she spoke through her teeth. \"You almost got a valuable member of the team killed!\"\n \"Correct,\" Rider said. \"Shark bait, right under the pier - \"\n \"I handled it, and also got a bunch of them tonight.\" Damali leaned on her sword and glared at Marlene.\n \"No more solo acts. Period. We\u0027re not looking for numbers - we\u0027re looking for the source - the quality of the kill, not the quantity. That\u0027s the part you don\u0027t get yet. We can do topside vamps for a lifetime, and still wouldn\u0027t make a dent. Strategy is what you\u0027re lacking, and common damned sense!\"\n Damali studied her blade and looked up from it with a sideways glance. She respected Marlene, but she was sick of her telling her what to do. Who put her in charge, anyway?\n \"Mar,\" Shabazz warned, \"drop it. She was doing what\u0027s natural, and there comes a point where you can\u0027t fight nature. You know that. A vampire huntress\u0027s job is to hunt.\"\n Shabazz\u0027s comment made Damali relax a bit as a brief feeling of vindication swept through her, but the way Marlene glared kept her on guard.\n \"A Neteru\u0027s job is to hunt, but her job is to also work within a team. It is not to imperil the lives of team members in the process - just like our job is to protect. And just because she\u0027s smelling herself does not mean she can disrespect - \"\n \"What!\" Damali could not believe Marlene had gone there. She was practically hang-jawed, but that state lasted about two seconds until indignant rage kicked in.\n \"That\u0027s right! Smelling yourself.\" Marlene\u0027s tone was sharp enough to cut. \"Getting Rider to steal a sword that\u0027s over seven thousand years old, given to me to give to you when I say you\u0027re ready. I let him take it - just to see what you\u0027d do!\" Marlene\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"You\u0027re not ready for this power, because you have no respect to go with it - and just because you can do something, doesn\u0027t mean you should. Lesson number one, as a huntress.\"\n Damali threw the blade on the equipment table, and the team pulled back, each standing slowly as Marlene circled her.\n \"Mar, you are fifty years old, and she\u0027s - \"\n Marlene\u0027s glare cut off Rider\u0027s words.\n \"This has been brewing for a long time,\" Shabazz said under his breath, moving to a neutral position out of the way.\n \"You can\u0027t let them go at it in here,\" J.L. said fast, incredulous. \"C\u0027mon, Mar, D, we\u0027re family, and this is very uncool. Chill!\" His eyes darted between the would-be combatants, worry tensing his expression.\n Marlene pointed her finger at Damali as she turned and ad-\n dressed J.L. \"You think I will not deal with her in here? Huh! I will not have a mutiny in this team, and whether she knows it or not, she\u0027s still got a few things to learn. She almost cost Rider his life tonight.\" Marlene\u0027s attention snapped back to Damali and held her with a hard stare. \"You just try me.\"\n The challenge ignited a level of defiance in Damali that was nearly intoxicating. But as she looked at Marlene\u0027s stricken expression, seeing fear, hurt, and concern, she forced herself to relax. Yeah, she could take Marlene in an all-out one-on-one, but there was indeed this thing called respect. And she did love this woman... .\n \"Look, I\u0027m sorry. And I shouldn\u0027t have cursed at you. I didn\u0027t mean it like that,\" Damali said, forcing herself to take a deep breath. \"I picked up the trail, then all this weird stuff started happening to me, and I couldn\u0027t turn it loose. I didn\u0027t mean to put Rider at risk. It won\u0027t happen again.\" She watched Marlene lower her arm and steady her breath.\n \"I\u0027m tired. I\u0027m going to bed.\" Damali cast a disparaging look at the team. \"Yeah. At night. And no, I\u0027m not afraid,\" she added sarcastically before they could speak - then snatched her sword as she left the room.\n \"Okay, that was fun,\" Rider said after they heard Damali\u0027s bedroom door slam.\n \"It\u0027s gonna get worse before it gets better.\" Shabazz sighed, finding a stool again. \"We\u0027ve got two queen bees in this hive.\"\n \"Oh, brother,\" J.L. mumbled on a long breath, going back to his computers.\n Marlene wrapped her arms around herself, closed her eyes, and leaned her head back. When two tears slipped down her cheeks, Shabazz stood, went to her, and hugged her.\n \"Baby, you know our job is almost over, right? She\u0027s ready to fly now.\"\n Marlene allowed her forehead to rest against his shoulder. \"But she\u0027s not ready, Shabazz. Her body is changing - she\u0027s going through Neteru physiology spikes, but it\u0027s not a stable transition ... hasn\u0027t locked in. The girl is a woman by society\u0027s standards - but by guardian and vampire huntress standards, she\u0027s just a child.\"\n \"I know, baby. It\u0027s tough on everybody. Like living with a teenager, times ten.\"\n \"Mar, exactly what\u0027s up with Damali?\" J.L. asked, watching them from his station. It was obvious that he had been just sitting there, staring at the screens.\n \"Her bone structure, while light as a feather, gains flexibility, density - as do her muscles and skin as she matures.\" Marlene let her breath out in a long, weary sigh. \"Can\u0027t really tell the difference between a Neteru and a normal kid until one of two things happen - either they are in a life or death situation, or they reach maturity.\"\n J.L. stared at Marlene. \"She could\u0027ve killed another kid, just in a schoolyard brawl...\"\n Marlene shook her head. \"No. It\u0027s adrenaline-activated. A normal schoolyard fight wouldn\u0027t have kicked this off. But something serious... yeah. She could have hurt somebody. It never got that bad for her, except once.\"\n Shabazz looked at Marlene, then down at the floor as he spoke, remembering how they found Damali after she\u0027d fought and run away from her foster father. \"The physical structure is to make her an even match to do battle with a master vampire. If the vamps throw her, she won\u0027t sustain a fracture as easily as we would. If they try to bite or scratch her, her skin will give, long enough for her to defend against it. She\u0027ll be able to withstand a bite, and once she\u0027s fully matured, won\u0027t turn. She\u0027ll be faster, stronger than all of us - will have everything to match up against a vamp ... telepathy, night vision, silent stealth, the nose to track them, the ears to hear the slightest register of sound ... and lightning quickness. It\u0027s all sending her through these ... these bursts. Even her voice is a weapon, it\u0027s a frequency that the males draw to, given their heightened hearing capacity. That\u0027s why she gravitated to the music industry.\"\n Marlene shook her head. \"By instinct she was seeking out experiences to ready her - to strengthen her skills... even if we had never shown up, she would have still been what she is now.\"\n Marlene backed away from Shabazz and walked, glancing at J.L. \"She\u0027s becoming a walking fighting machine ... but, there\u0027s a flaw, or, I should say, a vulnerability.\"\n \"What else, Mar? What\u0027s the vulnerability?\" Rider studied Marlene, and glanced at his teammates. \"That female vamp made her crazy.\"\n \"Yeah. I know.\" Marlene went to the window. \"She\u0027ll make the females attack. The inner core forces around a master vampire are generally females, for some reason. But, for the males, Damali\u0027s scent is like a drug; an aphrodisiac ... makes them go nuts.\"\n \"Get the fuck outta here.\" Rider rubbed his hand along his jaw.\n Marlene remained calm as she spoke. The time had come; the team needed to know. \"The female Neteru can then draw the males out, and this drug she emits will make them hesitate to kill her - making them have to choose to kill her or take her, but it gives a vampire huntress the split-second blade advantage.\"\n Shabazz nodded. \"The same scenario holds true for male Neterus - they emit a pheromone that weakens the female vamps that guard a master, and will make them hesitate to attack him, leaving the master vamp they guard vulnerable. The master male vampires go postal at the scent of a male vampire hunter, and \"won\u0027t hide, will fight with pure emotion without strategy.\"\n Marlene sighed. \"Master males are highly sensory creatures -\n within the hierarchy of vamps. But, they can ...\"\n \"Mar, tell \u0027em,\" Shabazz murmured, as J.L. now stood with Rider.\n \"Her telepathy is going to lock in on a master very soon to pull him out of the safety of his lair, and ...\" Marlene walked in a circle now, wringing her hands. \"I\u0027ve tried to do the best I could ... You all have no idea the worry. She might have already locked in on a master - which could be why she\u0027s blocking me as her guardian seer so I won\u0027t detect it, because she\u0027s so anxious to go after him that she doesn\u0027t want to risk having any of us block her hunt. Or, it could be just plain old defiance - her wanting to do this solo.\"\n \"You know that\u0027s a natural thing, too,\" Shabazz said quietly. \"The most difficult thing for all the Neterus, male or female, is to learn to work within a team. Half of their mind wants to keep the team safe by rushing into battle alone, the other half of their mind isn\u0027t totally rational when the blood lust hits them. That\u0027s our job as guardians, to teach the slayer how to temper those impulses and refine her strategy.\"\n \"Whatever it is, her power is fluctuating from the strain of sensing and blocking before she\u0027s ready. There are days when the kid is wide open, and I can read her like a book. Then, other days, I get a blank page. It\u0027s so frustrating - you all have no idea what I worry about!\" Marlene whipped around and held Rider in her stare. \"Rider... what if you had been out there with her, and her power dipped - even for a split second? Do you understand the magnitude of this? Don\u0027t you all see why I\u0027m so upset? I\u0027m not the bad guy. The closer she gets to her twenty-first birthday, the more vulnerable she is until she crosses over that line of transition. I only allowed you to give her the sword because I didn\u0027t expect that she\u0027d have to use it.\"\n \"Marlene, these are significant changes - but what does a couple of days have to do with - \"\n \"Marlene, spit it out.\" Shabazz held her gaze, but his eyes were gentle.\n \"She\u0027ll go into ... there\u0027s no delicate way to put this.\" Marlene sighed and stared at the wall. \"She\u0027ll go into heat. She\u0027ll want a master to come to her, and she\u0027ll be giving off a scent that will bug him out. It\u0027s in her DNA. She\u0027ll also broadcast erotic telepathic images.\" Marlene gave a dry laugh. \"Funny how she\u0027ll use one of a vamp\u0027s greatest strengths - seduction - against him. But unless that huntress is seasoned, she\u0027ll be dancing on the edge of her own very powerful desires. That\u0027s why we, as guardians, are supposed to keep the Neteru in our care away from a central lair until she\u0027s ready. That\u0027s our code, our rules of the game.\"\n Marlene looked at each guardian, her gaze connecting with each pair of stunned eyes before she spoke again. \"Now do you gentlemen hear me? Damali found a nest perimeter too soon, and days can make the difference. It wasn\u0027t supposed to happen like this.\"\n \"Oh ... shit... ,\" Rider murmured. \"A fuckin\u0027 catch-22, if ever I heard one.\"\n \"It\u0027s deep,\" Shabazz said, rubbing his jaw and studying nothing on the floor. \"When Marlene told me, I didn\u0027t want to accept it. But after what I saw tonight, Mar ain\u0027t overreacting.\"\n J.L. muttered, walked in a slow, dazed circle. \"Damn, Mar.\"\n \"In the meantime, you\u0027re telling us that until she\u0027s one hundred percent through this Neteru adolescence, we have to be sure she doesn\u0027t roll some master vamp?\" Rider wiped his palms over his face. \"Geez, Louise!\"\n \"She\u0027ll be testy, evil, and wearing us out.\" Shabazz sighed.\n \"That\u0027s why ever since the heavens aligned, Mar has had this place under total lockdown. Tomorrow, we\u0027ve gotta fill in Mike and Jose, assuming Jose is strong enough to come home.\"\n \"Would you all explain this planets thing you\u0027ve been tripping about since May? What the hell? Might as well put it all out on the table now, don\u0027tcha think?\"\n Marlene nodded, found a stool, and sat down. \"We started going on the offensive because she needed to totally conquer fear and get ready for a battle with a master vamp. Think of these other minor skirmishes as going up against sparring partners. I just didn\u0027t want her to take unnecessary risks on her own until she was fully prepared.\" Her eyes were sad, as though she\u0027d been defeated before the real fight had even begun.\n \"That much I\u0027m stringing together,\" Rider said in a weary tone. \"It\u0027s the astrology I\u0027m drawing a blank on.\"\n Marlene used her finger to mark invisible points on the table, and the crew gathered around her. \"There was a five-planet array that happened in the heavens in May ... Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Mercury, and Venus - they made a straight line for the first time in several hundred years, and in the next hundred years, this will only occur three more times.\" She glanced at the blank expressions each guardian offered her as a response. \"Don\u0027t you get it?\"\n \"Duh-uh, noooo ...\"\n \"Rider, people, the planet Jupiter is known as the planet of expansion. When it shows up and transits, big things that are either very good or very bad on a major scale occur. A vampire huntress being born, and then going through a Neteru heat in a new millennium is a big thing that is good, but it\u0027s also occurring at a time when some major bad stuff is happening on the planet.\"\n \"Deep.\"\n \"Right, J.L.\" Marlene paused for dramatic effect, satisfied that she now had the group\u0027s full attention. \"Saturn is the planet of karmic lessons - its lining up in direct alignment with Jupiter means that some very big lessons will be taught by the unforgiving taskmaster of the universe, Saturn. Then conies Venus - the planet of love, combined in alignment with the planet of war, Mars, lining up with Mercury - the universe\u0027s messenger.\"\n She let her breath out hard and crossed her arms over her chest. \"This constellation won\u0027t happen again until 2040, then again in 2060, and 2100. If we count this alignment, with the others, it means it will occur three times within a Neteru\u0027s lifespan ... she\u0027s dealing with huge issues - good or bad, karmic lessons, war, love, hinged on communication. And, it just so happens that our huntress has a window in which to conceive during this first alignment.\" She stopped speaking for a moment when they all gaped. \"Something else happened, too, after the initial alignment.\"\n \"There\u0027s more?\" J.L. whispered.\n \"Three of the planets most influential in this particular alignment subsequently formed a giant pyramid in the sky. Mars - war, Venus - love, and Saturn - lessons, broke straight-line formation to create a spectacular celestial gathering. That\u0027s when I knew. This first transit is forming a triangle in the sky, a trinity. The pyramid shape told me this thing we\u0027re dealing with was raised from old Egypt, Kemet. There will be three sides to the battle, a trinity of forces our slayer will have to cope with - love, war, and her old lessons.\"\n Shabazz just nodded. J.L. stared at her without blinking. Rider didn\u0027t say a word.\n \"We\u0027re in for the ride of our lives, gentlemen. That\u0027s why we cannot afford any slip-ups, people getting drunk, off somewhere unaccounted for. This is very, very serious.\"\n For a moment, no one spoke, but allowed the silence to help them absorb the bomb that had just been dropped on them. Their expressions were a combination of awe and fear.\n \"I have a confession to make. ...\" Rider cast a sheepish glance around the table, even as he avoided Marlene\u0027s gaze. \"When we were on two-by-two detail, I sorta told her to go ahead and get her run out - get the Carlos thing out of her system.\"\n Marlene closed her eyes and shook her head. \"Some human boyfriend is the least of my worries. The only reason I object to that knucklehead is because he\u0027s a distraction, and his lifestyle is so negative.\"\n \"But I thought - \"\n \"I\u0027m not worried about her virginity, Rider!\" Marlene fought to steady her breathing. \"I know you all think I\u0027m just some uptight old bat, but let me inform you that, I, too, once was young and had a life.\"\n Marlene held them all in a glare for a moment before speaking again. \"Damali can still die from a gunshot wound, or a car accident, or a stab in a bar brawl - if she\u0027s not paying enough attention to avoid it. Our huntress could wind up in jail, where she\u0027d be isolated from the team without a weapon, and anything could slip through the bars at night.\"\n \"I hear you,\" Shabazz murmured. \"Lotta stuff comes in the lockdown wards.\" He smiled. \"Ask me how I know.\"\n J.L. and Rider let their breaths out in unison, causing a combined whistle.\n \"That\u0027s right,\" Marlene said flatly, her hands now on her hips. \"Somebody like Carlos lives in the streets, primarily at night, where they both could get jacked by a vampire posse while out clubbing and having fun, as you call it, and all his militia won\u0027t be able to protect our slayer. Or they could roll up on her while she\u0027s in Carlos\u0027s bed, with all her defenses down and no blade on her; something could slip through a window or a vent, and trust me, that girl wouldn\u0027t see it coming - she\u0027d be distracted! Been there. Trust me.\"\n \"Damn, Marlene, I\u0027m sorry ... I didn\u0027t - \" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/minion-vampire-huntress-legend-1/page-11.html","bookId":2525,"book":{"id":2525,"title":"Minion (Vampire Huntress Legend #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Minion (Vampire Huntress Legend #1) \n There is one woman who is all that stands between us and the eternal night.
