{"id":2700,"title":"Looking for Alaska","description":"Storyline: Before. Miles \"Pudge\" Halter\u0027s whole existence has been one big nonevent, and his obsession with famous last words has only made him crave the \"Great Perhaps\" (Fran√ßois Rabelais, poet) even more. He heads off to the sometimes crazy, possibly unstable, and anything-but-boring world of Culver Creek Boarding School, and his life becomes the opposite of safe. Because down the hall is Alaska Young. The gorgeous, clever, funny, sexy, self-destructive, screwed-up, and utterly fascinating Alaska Young, who is an event unto herself. She pulls Pudge into her world, launches him into the Great Perhaps, and steals his heart. \\n After. Nothing is ever the same.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/looking-for-alaska.jpg","author":"John Green","type":"Young Adult","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":9,"name":"Young Adult","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
