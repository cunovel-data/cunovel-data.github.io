{"id":20425,"no":30,"title":"CHAPTER XXX. FRANK CALLS ON SQUIRE HAYNES","content":"The next morning Mr. Morton was a passenger by the early stage for Webbington, where he took the train for Boston. Thence he was to proceed to New York by the steamboat train. “Good-by, Mr. Morton,” said Frank, waving his cap as the stage started. “I hope you\u0027ll soon be back.” “I hope so, too; good-by.” Crack went the whip, round went the wheels. The horses started, and the stage rumbled off, swaying this way and that, as if top-heavy. Frank went slowly back to the house, feeling quite lonely. He had become so accustomed to Mr. Morton\u0027s companionship that his departure left a void which he hardly knew how to fill. As he reflected upon Mr. Morton\u0027s story he began to feel an increased uneasiness at the mortgage held by Squire Haynes upon his father\u0027s farm. The time was very near at hand—only ten days off—when the mortgage might be foreclosed, and but half the money was in readiness. Perhaps, however, Squire Haynes had no intention of foreclosing. If so, there was no occasion for apprehension. But about this he felt by no means certain. He finally determined, without consulting his mother, to make the squire a visit and inquire frankly what he intended to do. The squire\u0027s answer would regulate his future proceedings. It was Frank\u0027s rule—and a very good one, too—to do at once whatever needed to be done. He resolved to lose no time in making his call. “Frank,” said his mother, as he entered the house, “I want you to go down to the store some time this forenoon, and get me half a dozen pounds of sugar.” “Very well, mother, I\u0027ll go now. I suppose it won\u0027t make any difference if I don\u0027t come back for an hour or two.” “No, that will be in time.” Mrs. Frost did not ask Frank where he was going. She had perfect faith in him, and felt sure that he would never become involved in anything discreditable. Frank passed through the village without stopping at the store. He deferred his mother\u0027s errand until his return. Passing up the village street, he stopped before the fine house of Squire Haynes. Opening the gate he walked up the graveled path and rang the bell. A servant-girl came to the door. “Is Squire Haynes at home?” inquired Frank. “Yes, but he\u0027s eating breakfast.” “Will he be through soon?” “Shure and I think so.” “Then I will step in and wait for him.” “Who shall I say it is?” “Frank Frost.” Squire Haynes had just passed his cup for coffee when Bridget entered and reported that Frank Frost was in the drawing-room and would like to see him when he had finished his breakfast. “Frank Frost!” repeated the squire, arching his eyebrows. “What does he want, I wonder?” “Shure he didn\u0027t say,” said Bridget. “Very well.” “He is captain of the boys\u0027 company, John, isn\u0027t he?” asked the squire. “Yes,” said John sulkily. “I wish him joy of his office. I wouldn\u0027t have anything to do with such a crowd of ragamuffins.” Of course the reader understands that this was “sour grapes” on John\u0027s part. Finishing his breakfast leisurely, Squire Haynes went into the room where Frank was sitting patiently awaiting him. Frank rose as he entered. “Good morning, Squire Haynes,” he said, politely rising as he spoke. “Good morning,” said the squire coldly. “You are an early visitor.” If this was intended for a rebuff, Frank did not choose to take any notice of it. “I call on a little matter of business, Squire Haynes,” continued Frank. “Very well,” said the squire, seating himself in a luxurious armchair, “I am ready to attend to you.” “I believe you hold a mortgage on our farm.” Squire Haynes started. The thought of Frank\u0027s real business had not occurred to him. He had hoped that nothing would have been said in relation to the mortgage until he was at liberty to foreclose, as he wished to take the Frosts unprepared. He now resolved, if possible, to keep Frank in ignorance of his real purpose, that he might not think it necessary to prepare for his attack. “Yes,” said he indifferently; “I hold quite a number of mortgages, and one upon your father\u0027s farm among them.” “Isn\u0027t the time nearly run out?” asked Frank anxiously. “I can look if you desire it,” said the squire, in the same indifferent tone. “I should be glad if you would.” “May I ask why you are desirous of ascertaining the precise date?” asked the squire. “Are you intending to pay off the mortgage?” “No, sir,” said Frank. “We are not prepared to do so at present.” Squire Haynes felt relieved. He feared for a moment that Mr. Frost had secured the necessary sum, and that he would be defeated in his wicked purpose. He drew out a large number of papers, which he rather ostentatiously scattered about the table, and finally came to the mortgage. “The mortgage comes due on the first of July,” he said. “Will it be convenient for you to renew it, Squire Haynes?” asked Frank anxiously. “Father being absent, it would be inconvenient for us to obtain the amount necessary to cancel it. Of course, I shall be ready to pay the interest promptly.” “Unless I should have sudden occasion for the money,” said the squire, “I will let it remain. I don\u0027t think you need feel any anxiety on the subject.” With the intention of putting Frank off his guard, Squire Haynes assumed a comparatively gracious tone. This, in the case of any other man, would have completely reassured Frank. But he had a strong distrust of the squire, since the revelation of his character made by his friend Mr. Morton. “Could you tell me positively?” he asked, still uneasy. “It is only ten days now to the first of July, and that is little enough to raise the money in.” “Don\u0027t trouble yourself,” said the squire. “I said unless I had sudden occasion for the money, because unforeseen circumstances might arise. But as I have a considerable sum lying at the bank, I don\u0027t anticipate anything of the kind.” “I suppose you will give me immediate notice, should it be necessary. We can pay four hundred dollars now. So, if you please, the new mortgage can be made out for half the present amount.” “Very well,” said the squire carelessly. “Just as you please as to that. Still, as you have always paid my interest regularly, I consider the investment a good one, and have no objection to the whole remaining.” “Thank you, sir,” said Frank, rising to go. Frank took his hat, and, bowing to the squire, sought the front door. His face wore a perplexed expression. He hardly knew what to think about the interview he had just had. “Squire Haynes talks fair enough,” he soliloquized; “and, perhaps, he means what he says. If it hadn\u0027t been for what Mr. Morton told me, I should have confidence in him. But a man who will betray a trust is capable of breaking his word to me. I think I\u0027ll look round a little, and see if I can\u0027t provide for the worse in case it comes.” Just after Frank left the house, John entered his father\u0027s presence. “What did Frank Frost want of you, father?” he asked. “He came about the mortgage.” “Did he want to pay it?” “No, he wants me to renew it.” “Of course you refused.” “Of course I did no such thing. Do you think I am a fool?” “You don\u0027t mean to say that you agreed to renew it?” demanded John, in angry amazement. Squire Haynes rather enjoyed John\u0027s mystification. “Come,” said he, “I\u0027m afraid you\u0027ll never make a lawyer if you\u0027re not sharper than that comes to. Never reveal your plans to your adversary. That\u0027s an important principle. If I had refused, he would have gone to work, and in ten days between now and the first of July, he\u0027d have managed in some way to scrape together the eight hundred dollars. He\u0027s got half of it now.” “What did you tell him, then?” “I put him off by telling him not to trouble himself—that I would not foreclose the mortgage unless I had unexpected occasion for the money.” “Yes, I see,” said John, his face brightening at the anticipated disaster to the Frosts. “You\u0027ll take care that there shall be some sudden occasion.” “Yes,” said the squire complacently. “I\u0027ll have a note come due, which I had not thought about, or something of the kind.” “Oh, that\u0027ll be bully.” “Don\u0027t use such low words, John. I have repeatedly requested you to be more careful about your language. By the way, your teacher told me yesterday that you are not doing as well now as formerly.” “Oh, he\u0027s an old muff. Besides, he\u0027s got a spite against me. I should do a good deal better at another school.” “We\u0027ll see about that. But I suspect he\u0027s partly right.” “Well, how can a feller study when he knows the teacher is determined to be down upon him?” “\u0027Feller!\u0027 I am shocked at hearing you use that word. \u0027Down upon him,\u0027 too!” “Very well; let me go where I won\u0027t hear such language spoken.” It would have been well if Squire Haynes had been as much shocked by bad actions as by low language. This little disagreement over, they began again to anticipate with pleasure the effect of the squire\u0027s premeditated blow upon the Frosts. “We\u0027ll come up with \u0027em?” said John, with inward exultation. Meanwhile, though the squire was entirely unconscious of it, there was a sword hanging over his own head.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2969/81770.html","bookId":375,"book":{"id":375,"title":"Frank\u0027s Campaign or the Farm and the Camp","description":"简介： The Town Hall in Rossville stands on a moderate elevation overlooking the principal street.
