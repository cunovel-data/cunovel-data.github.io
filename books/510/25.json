FOGG\u0027S STORY AT THE MADHOUSE TO SWEENEY TODD.","content":"After a short pause, during which Mr. Fogg appeared to be referring to the cells of memory, with the view of being refreshed in a matter that had long since been a by-gone, but which he desired to place as clearly before his listener as he could, in fact, to make, if possible, the relation real to him, and to omit nothing during its progress that should be told; or possibly, that amiable individual was engaged in considering if there were any salient point that might criminate himself, or give even a friend a handle to make use of against him; but apparently there was nothing of the kind, for, after a loud \"hem!\" he filled the glasses, saying— \"Well, now, as you are a friend, I don\u0027t mind telling you how we do business here—things that have been done, you know, by others; but I have had my share as well as others—I have known a thing or two, Mr. Todd, and I may say I have done a thing or two, too.\" \"Well, we must live and let live,\" said Sweeney Todd, \"there\u0027s no going against that, you know; if all I have done could speak, why—but no matter, I am listening to you—however, if deeds could speak, one or two clever things would come out rather, I think.\" \"Ay, \u0027tis well they don\u0027t,\" said Mr. Fogg, with much solemnity, \"if they did they would be constantly speaking at times when it would be very inconvenient to hear them, and dangerous besides.\" \"So it would,\" said Sweeney, \"a still tongue makes a wise head—but then the silent system would bring no grist to the mill, and we must speak when we know we are right and among friends.\" \"Of course,\" said Fogg, \"of course, that\u0027s the right use of speech, and one may as well be without it, as to have it and not use it; but come—drink, and fill again before I begin, and then to my tale. But we may as well have a sentiment. Sentiment, you know,\" continued Fogg, \"is the very soul of friendship. What do you say to \u0027The heart that can feel for another?\u0027\" \"With all my soul,\" said Sweeney Todd; \"it\u0027s very touching—very touching, indeed. \u0027The heart that can feel for another!\u0027\" and as he spoke, he emptied the glass, which he pushed towards Fogg to refill. \"Well,\" said Fogg, as he complied, \"we have had the sentiment, we may as well have the exemplification.\" \"Ha! ha! ha!\" said Todd, \"very good, very good indeed; pray go on, that will do capitally.\" \"I may as well tell you the whole matter, as it occurred; I will then let you know all I know, and in the same manner. None of the parties are now living, or, at least, they are not in this country, which is just the same thing, so far as I am concerned.\" \"Then that is an affair settled and done with,\" remarked Sweeney Todd, parenthetically. \"Yes, quite.—Well, it was one night—such a one as this, and pretty well about the same hour, perhaps somewhat earlier than this. However, it doesn\u0027t signify a straw about the hour, but it was quite night, a dark and wet night too, when a knock came at the street-door—a sharp double knock—it was. I was sitting alone, as I might have been now, drinking a glass or two of wine; I was startled, for I was thinking about an affair I had on hand at that very moment, of which there was a little stir. However, I went to the door, and peeped through a grating that I had there, and saw only a man; he had drawn his horse inside the gate, and secured him. He wore a large Whitney riding-coat, with a nap that would have thrown off a deluge. I fancied, or thought I could tell, that he meant no mischief; so I opened the door at once and saw a tall, gentlemanly man, but wrapped up so, that you could not tell who or what he was; but my eyes are sharp, you know, Mr. Todd. We haven\u0027t seen so much of the world without learning to distinguish what kind of person one has to deal with?\" \"I should think not,\" said Todd. \"\u0027Well,\u0027 said I, \u0027what is your pleasure, sir?\u0027 \"The stranger paused a moment or two before he made any reply to me. \"\u0027Is your name Fogg?\u0027 he said. \"\u0027Yes, it is,\u0027 said I; \u0027my name is Fogg—what is your pleasure with me, sir?\u0027 \"\u0027Why,\u0027 said he, after another pause, during which he fixed his keen eye very hard upon me—\u0027why, I wish to have a little private conversation with you, if you can spare so much time, upon a very important matter which I have in hand.\u0027 \"\u0027Walk in, sir,\u0027 said I, as soon as I heard what it was he wanted, and he followed me in. \u0027It is a very unpleasant night, and it\u0027s coming on to rain harder. I think it is fortunate you have got housed.\u0027 \"\u0027Yes,\u0027 he replied; \u0027but I am tolerably well protected against the rain, at all events.\u0027 \"He came into this very parlour, and took a seat before the fire, with his back to the light, so that I couldn\u0027t see his face very well. However, I was determined that I would be satisfied in these particulars, and so, when he had taken off his hat, I stirred up the fire, and had a blaze that illuminated the whole room, and which showed me the sharp, thin visage of my visitor, who was a dark man, with keen grey eyes that were very restless—\u0027 \"\u0027Will you have a glass of wine?\u0027 said I; \u0027the night is cold as well as wet.\u0027 \"\u0027Yes, I will,\u0027 he replied; \u0027I am cold with riding. You have a lonely place about here; your house, I see, stands alone too. You have not many neighbours.\u0027 \"\u0027No, sir,\u0027 said I, \u0027we hadn\u0027t need, for when any of the poor things set to screaming, it would make them feel very uncomfortable indeed.\u0027 \"\u0027So it would, there is an advantage in that to yourself as well as to them. It would be disagreeable to you to know that you were disturbing your neighbours, and they would feel equally uncomfortable in being disturbed, and yet you must do your duty.\u0027 \"\u0027Ay! to be sure,\u0027 said I; \u0027I must do my duty, and people won\u0027t pay me for letting madmen go, though they may for keeping them; and besides that, I think some on \u0027em would get their throats cut, if I did.\u0027 \"\u0027You are right—quite right,\u0027 said he; \u0027I am glad to find you of that mind, for I came to you concerning an affair that requires some delicacy about it, since it is a female patient.\u0027 \"\u0027Ah!\u0027 said I, \u0027I always pay great attention, very great attention; and I don\u0027t recollect a case, however violent it may be, but what I can overcome. I always make \u0027em acknowledge me, and there\u0027s much art in that.\u0027 \"\u0027To be sure, there must be.\u0027 \"\u0027And, moreover, they wouldn\u0027t so soon crouch and shrink away from me, and do what I tell \u0027em, if I did not treat them with kindness, that is, as far as is consistent with one\u0027s duty, for I mustn\u0027t forget that.\u0027 \"\u0027Exactly,\u0027 he replied; \u0027those are my sentiments exactly.\u0027 \"\u0027And now, sir, will you inform me in what way I can serve you?\u0027 \"\u0027Why I have a relative, a female relative, who is unhappily affected with a brain disease; we have tried all we can do, without any effect. Do what we will, it comes to the same thing in the end.\u0027 \"\u0027Ah!\u0027 said I; \u0027poor thing—what a dreadful thing it must be to you or any of her friends, who have the charge of her, to see her day by day an incurable maniac. Why, it is just as bad as when a friend or relative is dead, and you are obliged to have the dead body constantly in your house, and before your eyes.\u0027 \"\u0027Exactly, my friend,\u0027 said the stranger; \u0027exactly, you are a man of discernment, Mr. Fogg. I see, that is truly the state of the case. You may then guess at the state of our feelings, when we have to part with one beloved by us.\u0027 \"As he spoke, he turned right round, and faced me, looking very hard into my face. \"\u0027Well,\u0027 said I, \u0027your\u0027s is a hard case; but to have one afflicted about you in the manner the young lady is, is truly distressing; it\u0027s like having a perpetual lumbago in your back.\u0027 \"\u0027Exactly,\u0027 said the stranger. \u0027I tell you what, you are the very man to do this thing for me.\u0027 \"\u0027I am sure of it,\u0027 said I. \"\u0027Then we understand each other, eh?\u0027 said the stranger. \u0027I must say I like your appearance, it is not often such people as you and I meet.\u0027 \"\u0027I hope it will be to our mutual advantage,\u0027 said I, \u0027because such people don\u0027t meet every day, and we oughtn\u0027t to meet to no purpose; so, in anything delicate and confidential you may command me.\u0027 \"\u0027I see, you are a clever man,\u0027 said he; \u0027well, well, I must pay you in proportion to your talents. How do you do business—by the job, or by the year?\u0027 \"\u0027Well,\u0027 said I, \u0027where it\u0027s a matter of some nicety, it may be both—but it entirely depends upon circumstances. I had better know exactly what it is I have to do.\u0027 \"\u0027Why, you see, it is a young female about eighteen, and she is somewhat troublesome—takes to screaming, and all that kind of thing. I want her taken care of, though you must be very careful she neither runs away nor suddenly commits any mischief, as her madness does not appear to me to have any particular form, and would at times completely deceive the best of us, and then suddenly she will break out violently, and snap or fly at anybody with her teeth.\u0027 \"\u0027Is she so bad as that?\u0027 \"\u0027Yes, quite. So it is quite impossible to keep her at home; and I expect it will be a devil of a job to get her here. I tell you what you shall have; I\u0027ll pay you your yearly charge for board and care, and I\u0027ll give you a ten-pound note for your trouble, if you\u0027ll come and assist me in securing her, and bringing her down. It will take some trouble.\u0027 \"\u0027Very well,\u0027 said I, \u0027that will do, but you must double the note and make it twenty, if you please; it will cost something to come and do the thing well.\u0027 \"\u0027I see—very well—we won\u0027t disagree about a ten-pound note; but you\u0027ll know how to dispose of her if she comes here.\u0027 \"\u0027Oh, yes—very healthy place.\u0027 \"\u0027But I don\u0027t know that health is a very great blessing to any one under such circumstances; indeed, who could regret an early grave to one so severely afflicted?\u0027 \"\u0027Nobody ought,\u0027 said I; \u0027if they knew what mad people went through, they would not, I\u0027m sure.\u0027 \"\u0027That is very true again, but the fact is, they don\u0027t, and they only look at one side of the picture; for my own part, I think that it ought to be so ordained, that when people are so afflicted, nature ought to sink under the affliction, and so insensibly to revert to the former state of nonentity.\u0027 \"\u0027Well,\u0027 said I, \u0027that may be as you please, I don\u0027t understand all that; but I tell you what, I hope if she were to die much sooner than you expect, you would not think it too much trouble to afford me some compensation for my loss.\u0027 \"\u0027Oh dear no! and to show you that I shall entertain no such illiberal feeling, I will give you two hundred pounds, when the certificate of her burial can be produced. You understand me?\u0027 \"\u0027Certainly.\u0027 \"\u0027Her death will be of little value to me, without the legal proof,\u0027 said the stranger; \u0027so she must die at her own pleasure, or live while she can.\u0027 \"\u0027Certainly,\u0027 said I. \"\u0027But what terrifies me,\u0027 continued the stranger, \u0027most is, her terror-stricken countenance, always staring us in our faces; and it arose from her being terrified; indeed I think if she were thoroughly frightened, she would fall dead. I am sure, if any wickedly-disposed person were to do so, death would no doubt result.\u0027 \"\u0027Ah!\u0027 said I, \u0027it would be a bad job; now tell me where I am to see you, and how about the particulars.\u0027 \"\u0027Oh, I will tell you; now, can you be at the corner of Grosvenor-street, near Park-lane?\u0027 \"\u0027Yes,\u0027 I replied, \u0027I will.\u0027 \"\u0027With a coach too. I wish you to have a coach, and one that you can depend upon, because there may be a little noise. I will try to avoid it, if possible, but we cannot always do what we desire; but you must have good horses.\u0027 \"\u0027Now, I tell you what is my plan; that is, if you don\u0027t mind the damages, if any happen.\u0027 \"\u0027What are they?\u0027 \"\u0027This:—suppose a horse falls, and is hurt, or an upset—would you stand the racket?\u0027 \"\u0027I would, of course.\u0027 \"\u0027Then listen to me; I have had more of these affairs than you have, no doubt. Well, then, I have had experience, which you have not. Now, I\u0027ll get a trotting-horse, and a covered cart or chaise—one that will go along well at ten miles an hour, and no mistake about it.\u0027 \"\u0027But will it hold enough?\u0027 \"\u0027Yes, four or five or six, and, upon a push, I have known eight to cram in it; but then you know we were not particular how we were placed; but still it will hold as many as a hackney coach, only not so conveniently; but then we have nobody in the affair to drive us, and there can\u0027t be too few.\u0027 \"\u0027Well, that is perhaps best; but have you a man on whom you can depend?—because if you have, why, I would not be in the affair at all.\u0027 \"\u0027You must,\u0027 said I; \u0027in the first place, I can depend upon one man best; him I must leave here to mind the place; so if you can manage the girl, I will drive, and I know the road as well as the way to my own mouth—I would rather have as few in it as possible.\u0027 \"\u0027Your precaution is very good, and I think I will try and so manage it, that there shall be only you and I acquainted with the transaction; at all events, should it become necessary, it will be time enough to let some other person into the secret at the moment their services are required. That, I think, will be the best arrangement that I can come to—what do you say?\u0027 \"\u0027That will do very well—when we get her here, and when I have seen her a few days, I can tell what to do with her.\u0027 \"\u0027Exactly; and now, good night—there is the money I promised, and now again, good night! I shall see you at the appointed time.\u0027 \"\u0027You will,\u0027 said I—\u0027one glass more, it will do you good, and keep the rain out.\u0027 \"He took off a glass of wine, and then pulled his hat over his face, and left the house. It was a dark, wet night, and the wind blew, and we heard the sound of his horse\u0027s hoofs for some time; however, I shut the door and went in, thinking over in my own mind what would be the gain of my own exertions. \"Well, at the appointed hour, I borrowed a chaise cart, a covered one, with what you call a head to it, and I trotted to town in it. At the appointed time I was at the corner of Grosvenor-street; it was late, and yet I waited there an hour or more before I saw any one. I walked into a little house to get a glass of spirits to keep up the warmth of the body, and when I came out again, I saw some one standing at my horse\u0027s head. I immediately went up. \"\u0027Oh, you are here,\u0027 he said. \"\u0027Yes I am,\u0027 said I, \u0027I have been here the Lord knows how long. Are you ready?\u0027 \"\u0027Yes, I am; come,\u0027 said he, as he got into the cart—\u0027come to the place I shall tell you—I shall only get her into the cart, and you must do the rest.\u0027 \"\u0027You\u0027ll come back with me; I shall want help on the road, and I have no one with me.\u0027 \"\u0027Yes, I will come with you, and manage the girl, but you must drive, and take all the casualties of the road, for I shall have enough to do to hold her and keep her from screaming when she does awake.\u0027 \"\u0027What! is she asleep?\u0027 \"\u0027I have given her a small dose of laudanum, which will cause her to sleep comfortably for an hour or two, but the cold air and disturbance will most probably awaken her at first.\u0027 \"\u0027Throw something over her, and keep her warm, and have something ready to thrust into her mouth, in case she takes to screaming, and then you are all right.\u0027 \"\u0027Good,\u0027 he replied: \u0027now wait here. I am going to yon house. When I have entered, and disappeared several minutes, you may quietly drive up, and take your station on the other side of the lamp-post.\u0027 \"As he spoke he got out, and walked to a large house, which he entered softly, and left the door ajar; and after he had gone in, I walked the horse quietly up to the lamp-post, and as I placed it, the horse and front of the cart were completely in the dark. I had scarcely got up to the spot, when the door opened, and he looked out to see if anybody was passing. I gave him the word, and out he came, leaving the door, and came with what looked like a bundle of clothes, but which was the young girl and some clothes he had brought with him. \"\u0027Give her to me,\u0027 said I, \u0027and jump up and take the reins; go on as quickly as you can.\u0027 \"I took the girl into my arms, and handed her into the back part of the chaise, while he jumped up, and drove away. I placed the young girl in an easy position upon some hay, and stuffed the clothes under her, so as to prevent the jolting from hurting her. \"\u0027Well,\u0027 said I, \u0027you may as well come back here, and sit beside her: she is all right. You seem rather in a stew.\u0027 \"\u0027Well, I have run with her in my arms, and altogether it has flurried me.\u0027 \"\u0027You had better have some brandy,\u0027 said I. \"\u0027No, no! don\u0027t stop.\u0027 \"\u0027Pooh, pooh!\u0027 I replied, pulling up, \u0027here is the last house we shall come to, to have a good stiff tumbler of hot brandy and water. Come, have you any change—about a sovereign will do, because I shall want change on the road? Come, be quick.\u0027 \"He handed me a sovereign, saying— \"\u0027Don\u0027t you think it\u0027s dangerous to stop—we may be watched, or she may wake.\u0027 \"\u0027Not a bit of it. She snores too loudly to wake just now, and you\u0027ll faint without the cordial; so keep a good look-out upon the wench, and you will recover your nerves again.\u0027 \"As I spoke I jumped out, and got two glasses of brandy and water, hot, strong, and sweet, I had in about two minutes made, out of the house. \"\u0027Here,\u0027 said I, \u0027drink—drink it all up—it will make your eyes start out of your head.\u0027 \"I spoke the truth, for what with my recommendations, and his nervousness and haste, he drank nearly half of it at a gulp. \"I shall never forget his countenance. Ha! ha! ha! I can\u0027t keep my mirth to myself. Just imagine the girl inside a covered cart, all dark, so dark that you could hardly see the outline of the shadow of a man, and then imagine, if you can, a pair of keen eyes, that shone in the dark like cat\u0027s eyes, suddenly give out a flash of light, and then turn round in their sockets, showing the whites awfully, and then listen to the fall of the glass, and see him grasp his throat with one hand, and thrust the other hand into his stomach. There was a queer kind of voice came from his throat, and then something like a curse and a groan escaped him. \"\u0027Damn it,\u0027 said I, \u0027what is the matter now?—you\u0027ve upset all the liquor—you are very nervous—you had better have another dose.\u0027 \"\u0027No more—no more,\u0027 he said faintly and huskily, \u0027no more—for God\u0027s sake no more. I am almost choked—my throat is scalded, and my entrails on fire!\u0027 \"\u0027I told you it was hot,\u0027 said I. \"\u0027Yes, hot, boiling hot—go on. I\u0027m mad with pain—push on.\u0027 \"\u0027Will you have any water, or anything to cool your throat?\u0027 said I. \"\u0027No, no—go on.\u0027 \"\u0027Yes,\u0027 said I, \u0027but the brandy and water is hot; however, it\u0027s going down very fast now—very fast indeed, here is the last mouthful;\u0027 and as I said so, I gulped it down, returned with the one glass, and then paid for the damage. \"This did not occupy five minutes, and away we came along the road at a devil of a pace, and we were all right enough; my friend behind me got over his scald, though he had a very sore gullet, and his intestines were in a very uncomfortable state; but he was better. Away we rattled, the ground rattling to the horse\u0027s hoofs and the wheels of the vehicle, the young girl still remaining in the same state of insensibility in which she had first been brought out. No doubt she had taken a stronger dose of the opium than she was willing to admit. That was nothing to me, but made it all the better, because she gave the less trouble, and made it safer. We got here easy enough, drove slap up to the door, which was opened in an instant, jumped out, took the girl, and carried her in. When once these doors are shut upon any one, they may rest assured that it is quite a settled thing, and they don\u0027t get out very easy, save in a wooden surtout; indeed, I never lost a boarder by any other means; we always keep one connection, and they are usually so well satisfied, that they never take any one away from us. Well, well! I carried her indoors, and left her in a room by herself on a bed. She was a nice girl—a handsome girl, I suppose people would call her, and had a low, sweet, and plaintive voice. But enough of this. \"\u0027She\u0027s all right,\u0027 said I, when I returned to this room, \u0027It\u0027s all right—I have left her.\u0027 \"\u0027She isn\u0027t dead,\u0027 he inquired, with much terror. \"\u0027Oh! no, no! she is only asleep, and has not woke up yet from the effects of the laudanum. Will you now give me one year\u0027s pay in advance?\u0027 \"\u0027Yes,\u0027 he replied, as he handed the money, and the remainder of the bonds. \u0027Now, how am I to do about getting back to London to-night?\u0027 \"\u0027You had better remain here.\u0027 \"\u0027Oh, no! I should go mad too, if I were to remain here; I must leave here soon.\u0027 \"\u0027Well, will you go to the village inn?\u0027 \"\u0027How far is that off?\u0027 \"\u0027About a mile—you\u0027ll reach it easy enough; I\u0027ll drive you over for the matter of that, and leave you there. I shall take the cart there.\u0027 \"\u0027Very well, let it be so; I will go. Well, well, I am glad it is all over, and the sooner it is over for ever, the better. I am truly sorry for her, but it cannot be helped. It will kill her, I have no doubt; but that is all the better: she will escape the misery consequent upon her departure, and release us from a weight of care.\u0027 \"\u0027So it will,\u0027 said I \u0027but come, we must go at once, if going you are.\u0027 \"\u0027Yes, yes,\u0027 he said hurriedly. \"\u0027Well then, come along; the horse is not yet unharnessed, and if we do not make haste, we shall be too late to obtain a lodging for the night.\u0027 \"\u0027That is very good,\u0027 he said, somewhat wildly: \u0027I am quite ready—quite.\u0027 \"We left the house, and trotted off to the inn at a good rate, where we arrived in about ten minutes or less, and then I put up the horse, and saw him to the inn, and came back as quick as I could on foot. \u0027Well, well,\u0027 I thought, \u0027this will do, I have had a good day of it—paid well for business, and haven\u0027t wanted for sport on the road.\u0027 \"Well, I came to the conclusion that if the whole affair was to speedily end, it would be more in my pocket than if she were living, and she would be far happier in heaven than here, Mr. Todd.\" \"Undoubtedly,\" said Mr. Sweeney Todd, \"undoubtedly, that is a very just observation of yours.\" \"Well, then, I set to work to find out how the matter could be managed, and I watched her until she awoke. She looked around her, and seemed much surprised and confused, and did not seem to understand her position, while I remained at hand.\" \"She sighed deeply, and put her hand to her head, and appeared for a time to be quite unable to comprehend what had happened to her, or where she was. I sent some tea to her, as I was not prepared to execute my purpose, and she seemed to recover, and asked some questions, but my man was dumb for the occasion, and would not speak, and the result was, she was very much frightened. I left her so for a week or two, and then, one day, I went into her cell. She had greatly altered in her appearance, and looked very pale. \"\u0027Well,\u0027 said I, \u0027how do you find yourself, now?\u0027 \"She looked up into my face, and shuddered; but she said in a calm voice, looking round her— \"\u0027Where am I?\u0027 \"\u0027You are here!\u0027 said I, \u0027and you\u0027ll be very comfortable if you only take on kindly, but you will have a strait waistcoat put on you if you do not.\u0027 \"\u0027Good God!\u0027 she exclaimed, clasping her hands, \u0027have they put me here—in—in—\u0027 \"She could not finish the sentence, and I supplied the word which she did not utter, and then she screamed loudly— \"\u0027Come,\u0027 said I, \u0027this will never do; you must learn to be quiet, or you\u0027ll have fearful consequences.\u0027 \"\u0027Oh mercy, mercy! I will do no wrong! What have I done that I should be brought here?—what have I done? They may take all I have if they will let me live in freedom. I care not where or how poor I may be. Oh, Henry! Henry!—if you knew where I was, would you not fly to my rescue? Yes, you would, you would!\u0027 \"\u0027Ah,\u0027 said I, \u0027there is no Henry here, and you must be content to do without one.\u0027 \"\u0027I could not have believed that my brother would have acted such a base part. I did not think him wicked, although I knew him to be selfish, mean, and stern, yet I did not think he intended such wickedness; but he thinks to rob me of all my property; yes, that is the object he has in sending me here.\u0027 \"\u0027No doubt,\u0027 said I. \"\u0027Shall I ever get out?\u0027 she inquired, in a pitiful tone; \u0027do not say my life is to be spent here!\u0027 \"\u0027Indeed it is,\u0027 said I; \u0027while he lives, you will never leave these walls.\u0027 \"\u0027He shall not attain his end, for I have deeds about me that he will never be able to obtain; indeed, he may kill me, but he cannot benefit by my death.\u0027 \"\u0027Well,\u0027 said I, \u0027it serves him right. And how did you manage that matter? how did you contrive to get the deeds away?\u0027 \"\u0027Never mind that; it is a small deed, and I have secured it. I did not think he would have done this thing; but he may yet relent. Will you aid me? I shall be rich, and can pay you well.\u0027 \"\u0027But your brother,\u0027 said I. \"\u0027Oh, he is rich without mine, but he is over-avaricious; but say you will help me—only help me to get out, and you shall be no loser by the affair.\u0027 \"\u0027Very well,\u0027 said I. \u0027Will you give me this deed as a security that you will keep your word?\u0027 \"\u0027Yes,\u0027 she replied, drawing forth the deed—a small parchment—from her bosom. \u0027Take it; and now let me out. You shall be handsomely rewarded.\u0027 \"\u0027Ah!\u0027 said I; \u0027but you must allow me first to settle this matter with my employers. You must really be mad. We do not hear of young ladies carrying deeds and parchments about them when they are in their senses.\u0027 \"\u0027You do not mean to betray me?\u0027 she said, springing up wildly and rushing towards the deed, which I carefully placed in my breast coat-pocket. \"\u0027Oh dear no! but I shall retain the deed, and speak to your brother about this matter.\u0027 \"\u0027My God! my God!\u0027 she exclaimed, and then she sank back on her bed, and in another moment she was covered with blood. She had burst a blood-vessel. I sent for a surgeon and physician, and they both gave it as their opinion that she could not be saved, and that a few hours would see the last of her. This was the fact. She was dead before another half hour, and then I sent to the authorities for the purpose of burial; and, producing the certificate of the medical men, I had no difficulty, and she was buried all comfortably without any trouble. \"\u0027Well,\u0027 thought I, \u0027this is a very comfortable affair; but it will be more profitable than I had any idea of, and I must get my first reward first, and if there should be any difficulty, I have the deed to fall back upon. He came down next day, and appeared with rather a long face. \"\u0027Well,\u0027 said he, \u0027how do matters go on here?\u0027 \"\u0027Very well,\u0027 said I, \u0027how is your throat?\u0027 \"I thought he cast a malicious look at me, as much as to imply he laid it all to my charge. \"\u0027Pretty well,\u0027 he replied; \u0027but I was ill for three days. How is the patient?\u0027 \"\u0027As well as you could possibly wish,\u0027 said I. \"\u0027She takes it kindly, eh? Well, I hardly expected it—but no matter. She\u0027ll be a long while on hand, I perceive. You haven\u0027t tried the frightening system yet, then?\u0027 \"\u0027Hadn\u0027t any need,\u0027 I replied, putting the certificate of her burial in his hand, and he jumped as if he had been stung by an adder, and turned pale; but he soon recovered, and smiled complaisantly as he said— \"\u0027Ah! well, I see you have been diligent, but I should have liked to have seen her, to have asked her about a missing deed; but no matter.\u0027 \"\u0027Now about the two hundred pounds,\u0027 said I. \"\u0027Why,\u0027 said he, \u0027I think one will do when you come to consider what you have received, and the short space of time and all: you had a year\u0027s board in advance.\u0027 \"\u0027I know I had; but because I have done more than you expected, and in a shorter time, instead of giving me more, you have the conscience to offer me less.\u0027 \"\u0027No, no, not the—the—what did you call it?—we\u0027ll have nothing said about that,—but here is a hundred pounds, and you are well paid.\u0027 \"\u0027Well,\u0027 said I, taking the money, \u0027I must have five hundred pounds at any rate, and unless you give it me, I will tell other parties where a certain deed is to be found.\u0027 \"\u0027What deed?\u0027 \"\u0027The one you were alluding to. Give me four hundred more, and you shall have the deeds.\u0027 \"After much conversation and trouble he gave it to me, and I gave him the deed, with which he was well pleased, but looked hard at the money, and seemed to grieve at it very much. \"Since that time I have heard that he was challenged by his sister\u0027s lover, and they went out to fight a duel, and he fell—and died. The lover went to the continent, where he has since lived. \"Ah,\" said Sweeney Todd, \"you have had decidedly the best of this affair: nobody gained anything but you.\" \"Nobody at all that I know of, save distant relations, and I did very well; but then, you \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276/89582.html","bookId":510,"book":{"id":510,"title":"The String of Pearls","description":"简介： The Romance of The String of Pearls having excited in the Literary world an almost unprecedented interest, it behoves the author to say a few words to his readers upon the completion of his labours....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
