{"id":11973,"no":1,"title":"PREFACE.","content":"The Romance of The String of Pearls having excited in the Literary world an almost unprecedented interest, it behoves the author to say a few words to his readers upon the completion of his labours. In answer to the many inquiries that have been, from time to time, made regarding the fact of whether there ever was such a person as Sweeney Todd in existence, we can unhesitatingly say, that there certainly was such a man; and the record of his crimes is still to be found in the chronicles of criminality of this country. The house in Fleet Street, which was the scene of Todd\u0027s crimes, is no more. A fire, which destroyed some half-dozen buildings on that side of the way, involved Todd\u0027s in destruction; but the secret passage, although, no doubt, partially blocked up with the re-building of St. Dunstan\u0027s Church, connecting the vaults of that edifice with the cellars of what was Todd\u0027s house in Fleet Street, still remains. From the great patronage which this work has received from the reading public, the author has to express his deep and earnest thanks; and he begs to state, that if anything more than another could stimulate him to renewed exertion to please his numerous patrons, it is their kind and liberal appreciation of his past labours. London, 1850. The String of Pearls; or, The Sailor\u0027s Gift. A Romance of Peculiar Interest. \"And now, Tobias, listen to me, and treasure up every word I say.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"I\u0027ll cut your throat from ear to ear, if you repeat one word of what passes in this shop, or dare to make any supposition, or draw any conclusion from anything you may see, or hear, or fancy you see or hear.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276/89558.html","bookId":510,"book":{"id":510,"title":"The String of Pearls","description":"简介： The Romance of The String of Pearls having excited in the Literary world an almost unprecedented interest, it behoves the author to say a few words to his readers upon the completion of his labours....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
