LOVETT FINDS THAT IT IS EASIER TO PLAN THAN TO EXECUTE.","content":"It wants five minutes to nine, and Mrs. Lovett\u0027s shop is filling with persons anxious to devour or to carry away one or more of the nine o\u0027clock batch of savoury, delightful, gushing gravy pies. Many of Mrs. Lovett\u0027s customers paid her in advance for the pies, in order that they might be quite sure of getting their orders fulfilled when the first batch should make its gracious appearance from the depths below. \"Well, Jiggs,\" said one of the legal fraternity to another, \"how are you to-day, old fellow? What do you bring it in?\" \"Oh! I ain\u0027t very blooming. The fact is, the count and I, and a few others, made a night of it last evening; and somehow or another I don\u0027t think whiskey-and-water, half-and-half, and tripe, go well together.\" \"I should wonder if they did.\" \"And so I\u0027ve come for a pie just to settle my stomach; you see I\u0027m rather delicate.\" \"Ah! you are just like me, young man, there,\" said an elderly personage; \"I have a delicate stomach, and the slightest thing disagrees with me. A mere idea will make me quite ill.\" \"Will it, really?\" \"Yes; and my wife, she—\" \"Oh, bother your wife! It\u0027s only five minutes to nine, don\u0027t you see? What a crowd there is, to be sure. Mrs. Lovett, you charmer, I hope you have ordered enough pies to be made to-night? You see what a lot of customers you have.\" \"Oh, there will be plenty.\" \"That\u0027s right. I say, don\u0027t push so; you\u0027ll be in time, I tell you; don\u0027t be pushing and driving in that sort of way—I\u0027ve got ribs.\" \"And so have I. Last night I didn\u0027t get a pie at all, and my old woman is in a certain condition, you see, gentlemen, and won\u0027t fancy anything but one of Lovett\u0027s veal pies; so I\u0027ve come all the way from Newington to get one for—\" \"Hold your row, will you? and don\u0027t push.\" \"For to have the child marked with a pie on its—\" \"Behind there, I say; don\u0027t be pushing a fellow as if it were half price at a theatre.\" Each moment added some new comers to the throng, and at last any strangers who had known nothing of the attractions of Mrs. Lovett\u0027s pie-shop and had walked down Bell Yard, would have been astonished at the throng of persons there assembled—a throng that was each moment increasing in density, and becoming more and more urgent and clamorous. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine! Yes, it is nine at last. It strikes by old St. Dunstan\u0027s church clock, and in weaker strains the chronometical machine at the pie-shop echoes the sound. What excitement there is to get at the pies when they shall come! Mrs. Lovett lets down the square moveable platform that goes on pullies in the cellar; some machinery, which only requires a handle to be turned, brings up a hundred pies in a tray. These are eagerly seized by parties who have previously paid, and such a smacking of lips ensues as never was known. Down goes the platform for the next hundred, and a gentlemanly man says— \"Let me work the handle, Mrs. Lovett, if you please; it\u0027s too much for you I\u0027m sure.\" \"Sir, you are very kind, but I never allow anybody on this side of the counter but my own people, sir. I can turn the handle myself, sir, if you please, with the assistance of this girl. Keep your distance, sir, nobody wants your help.\" \"But my dear madam, only consider your delicacy. Really you ought not to be permitted to work away like a negro slave at a winch handle. Really you ought not.\" The man who spoke thus obligingly to Mrs. Lovett, was tall and stout, and the lawyers clerks repressed the ire they otherwise would probably have given utterance to at thus finding any one quizzing their charming Mrs. Lovett. \"Sir, I tell you again that I don\u0027t want your help; keep your distance, sir, if you please.\" \"Now don\u0027t get angry, fair one,\" said the man. \"You don\u0027t know but I might have made you an offer before I left the shop.\" \"Sir,\" said Mrs. Lovett, drawing herself up and striking terror into the hearts of the limbs of the law. \"Sir! What do you want? Say what you want, and be served, sir, and then go. Do you want a pie, sir?\" \"A pie? Oh, dear no, I don\u0027t want a pie. I would not eat one of the nasty things on any account. Pah!\" Here the man spat on the floor. \"Oh, dear, don\u0027t ask me to eat any of your pies.\" \"Shame, shame,\" said several of the lawyers clerks. \"Will any gentleman who thinks it a shame, be so good as to step forward and say so a little closer?\" Everybody shrunk back upon this, instead of accepting the challenge, and Mrs. Lovett soon saw that she must, despite all the legal chivalry by which she was surrounded, fight her battles herself. With a look of vehement anger, she cried— \"Beware, sir, I am not to be trifled with. If you carry your jokes too far, you will wish that you had not found your way, sir, into this shop.\" \"That, madam,\" said the tall stout man, \"is not surely possible, when I have the beauty of a Mrs. Lovett to gaze upon, and render the place so exquisitely attractive; but if you will not permit me to have the pleasure of helping you up with the next batch of pies, which, after all, you may find heavier than you expect, I must leave you to do it yourself.\" \"So that I am not troubled any longer by you, sir, at all,\" said Mrs. Lovett, \"I don\u0027t care how heavy the next batch of pies may happen to be, sir.\" \"Very good, madam.\" \"Upon my word,\" said a small boy, giving the side of his face a violent rub with the hope of finding the ghost of a whisker there, \"it\u0027s really too bad.\" \"Ah, who\u0027s that? Let me get at him!\" \"Oh, no, no, I—mean—that it\u0027s too bad of Mrs. Lovett, my dear sir. Oh, don\u0027t.\" \"Oh, very good; I am satisfied. Now, madam, you see that even your dear friends here, from Lincoln\u0027s Inn—Are you from the Inn, small boy?\" \"Yes, sir, if you please.\" \"Very good. As I was saying, Mrs. Lovett, you now must of necessity perceive, that even your friends from the Inn, feel that your conduct is really too bad, madam.\" Mrs. Lovett was upon this so dreadfully angry, that she disdained any reply to the tall stout man, but at once she applied herself to the windlass, which worked up the little platform, upon which a whole tray of a hundred pies was wont to come up, and began to turn it with what might be called a vengeance. How very strange it was—surely the words of the tall stout impertinent stranger were prophetic, for never before had Mrs. Lovett found what a job it was to work that handle, as upon that night. The axle creaked, and the cords and the pullies strained and wheezed, but she was a determined woman, and she worked away at it. \"I told you so, my dear madam,\" said the stranger; \"it is more evidently than you can do.\" \"Peace, sir.\" \"I am done; work away ma\u0027am, only don\u0027t say afterwards that I did not offer to help you, that\u0027s all.\" Indignation was swelling at the heart of Mrs. Lovett, but she felt that if she wasted her breath upon the impertinent stranger, she should have none for the windlass; so setting her teeth, she fagged at it with a strength and a will that if she had not been in a right royal passion, she could not have brought to bear upon it on any account. There was quite an awful stillness in the shop. All eyes were bent upon Mrs. Lovett, and the cavity through which the next batch of those delicious pies were coming. Those who had had the good fortune to get one of the first lot, had only had their appetites heightened by the luxurious feast they had partaken of, while those who had had as yet none, actually licked their lips, and snuffed up the delightful aroma from the remains of the first batch. \"Two for me, Mrs. Lovett,\" cried a voice. \"One veal for me. Three porks—one pork.\" The voices grew fast and furious. \"Silence!\" cried the tall stout man. \"I will engage that everybody shall be fully satisfied; and no one shall leave here without a thorough conviction that his wants in pies has been more than attended to.\" The platform could be made to stop at any stage of its upward progress, by means of a ratchet wheel and a catch, and now Mrs. Lovett paused to take breath. She attributed the unusual difficulty in working the machinery to her own weakness, contingent upon her recent immersion in the Thames. \"Sir,\" she said between her clenched teeth, addressing the man who was such an eye-sore to her in the shop. \"Sir, I don\u0027t know who you are, but I hope to be able to show you when I have served these gentlemen, that even I am not to be insulted with impunity.\" \"Anything you please, madam,\" he replied, \"in a small way, only don\u0027t exert yourself too much.\" Mrs. Lovett flew to the windlass again, and from the manner in which she now worked at it, it was quite clear that when she had her hands free from that job, she fully intended to make good her threats against the tall stout man. The young beardless scions of the law, trembled at the idea of what might happen. And now the tops of the pies appeared. Then they saw the rim of the large tray upon which they were, and then just as the platform itself was level with the floor of the shop, up flew tray and pies, as if something had exploded beneath them, and a tall slim man sprung upon the counter. It was the cook, who from the cellars beneath, had laid himself as flat as he could beneath the tray of pies, and so had been worked up to the shop by Mrs. Lovett! Mrs. Lovett\u0027s Cook Astonishes Her Customers, Rather. Mrs. Lovett\u0027s Cook Astonishes Her Customers, Rather. \"Gentlemen,\" he cried, \"I am Mrs. Lovett\u0027s cook. The pies are made of human flesh!\" We shrink, we tremble at the idea of attempting to describe the scene that ensued in the shop of Mrs. Lovett contingent upon this frightful apparition, and still more frightful speech of the cook; but duty—our duty to the public—requires that we should say something upon the occasion. If we can do nothing more, we can briefly enumerate what did actually take place in some instances. About twenty clerks rushed into Bell Yard, and there and then, to the intense surprise of the passers-by, became intensely sick. The cook, with one spring, cleared the counter, and alighted amongst the customers, and with another spring, the tall impertinent man, who had made many remarks to Mrs. Lovett of an aggravating tendency, cleared the counter likewise in the other direction, and, alighting close to Mrs. Lovett, he cried— \"Madam, you are my prisoner!\" For a moment, and only for a moment, the great—the cunning, and the redoubtable Mrs. Lovett, lost her self-possession, and, staggering back, she lurched heavily against the glass-case next to the wall, immediately behind the counter. It was only for a moment, though, that such an effect was produced upon Mrs. Lovett; and then, with a spring like an enraged tigress, she caught up a knife that was used for slipping under the pies and getting them cleanly out of the little tins, and rushed upon the tall stranger. Yes, she rushed upon him; but for once in a way, even Mrs. Lovett had met with her match. With a dexterity, that only long practice in dealings with the more desperate portion of human nature could have taught him, the tall man closed with her, and had the knife out of her hand in a moment. He at once threw it right through the window into Bell Yard, and then, holding Mrs. Lovett in his arms, he said— \"My dear madam, you only distress yourself for nothing; all resistance is perfectly useless. Either I must take you prisoner, or you me, and I decidedly incline to the former alternative.\" The knife that had been thrown through the window was not without its object, for in a moment afterwards Mr. Crotchet made his appearance in the shop. \"All right, Crotchet,\" said he who had captured Mrs. Lovett; \"first clap the bracelets on this lady.\" \"Here yer is,\" said Crotchet. \"Lor, mum! I had a eye on you months and months agone. How is you, mum, in yer feelin\u0027s this here nice evening?—Eh mum?\" \"A knife—a knife! Oh, for a knife!\" cried Mrs. Lovett. \"Ex-actly, mum,\" added Crotchet, as he with professional dexterity slipped the handcuffs on her wrists. \"Would you like one with a hivory handle, mum? or would anything more common do, mum?\" Mrs. Lovett fell to the floor, or rather she cast herself to it, and began voluntarily beating her head against the boards. They quickly lifted her up; and then the tall stranger turned to the cook, who, after leaping over the counter, had sat down upon a chair in a state of complete exhaustion, and he said— \"Do you know the way to Sir Richard\u0027s office, in Craven Street? He expects you there, I believe?\" \"Yes, yes. But now that all is over, I feel very ill.\" \"In that case, I will go with you, then. Crotchet, who have you got outside?\" \"Only two of our pals, Muster Green; but it\u0027s all right, if so be as you leaves the lady to us.\" \"Very well. The warrant is at Newgate, and the governor is expecting her instant arrival. You will get a coach at the corner of the yard, and be off with her at once.\" \"All\u0027s right,\" said Crotchet. \"I knowed as she\u0027d be nabbed, and I had one all ready, you sees.\" \"That was right, Crotchet. How amazingly quick everybody has left the shop. Why—why, what is all this?\" As the officer spoke, about half a dozen squares of glass in the shop window of the house were broken in, and a ringing shout from a dense mob that was rapidly collecting in the yard, came upon the ears of the officer. The two men whom Crotchet had mentioned, with difficulty pressed their way into the shop, and one of them cried— \"The people that were in the shop have spread the news all over the neighbourhood, and the place is getting jammed up with a mob, every one of which is mad, I think, for they talk of nothing but of the tearing of Mrs. Lovett to pieces. They are pouring in from Fleet Street and Carey Street by hundreds at a time.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276/89672.html","bookId":510,"book":{"id":510,"title":"The String of Pearls","description":"简介： The Romance of The String of Pearls having excited in the Literary world an almost unprecedented interest, it behoves the author to say a few words to his readers upon the completion of his labours....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
