{"id":12013,"no":41,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIX. THE MYSTERIOUS CUPBOARD.","content":"\"Here they are,\" said Crotchet. \"Some of these are worth something.\" \"Get a cane or two, likewise.\" \"All\u0027s right, sir. I tell you what it is, sir. If there\u0027s such things as ghosts in the world, I wonder how this Todd can sleep o\u0027 nights, for he must have a plaguy lot of \u0027em about his bed of a night.\" \"Perhaps he satisfied himself upon that head, Crotchet, before he began his evil practices, for all we know; but let us make our way into another room, for I think we have seen all there is to see in this one.\" \"Not a doubt of it. It\u0027s only a kind of store-room, this, and from the size of it, I should say it ain\u0027t the largest on this floor.\" Sir Richard walked out of the room on to the landing place. All was perfectly still in the barber\u0027s house, and as he had heard nothing of the bugle sound in Fleet-street, he felt quite satisfied that Todd had not returned. It was a great thing, in all his daring exploits in discovering criminals, and successfully ferreting out their haunts, that he (Sir Richard) could thoroughly depend upon his subordinates. He knew they were not only faithful but brave. He knew that, let what might happen, they would never leave him in the lurch. Hence, in the present instance, he felt quite at his ease in the house of Todd, so long as he did not hear the sound of the bugle. Of course, personal danger he did not consider, for he knew he was, if even he had been alone, more than a match for Todd; but what he wanted was, not to overcome Sweeney Todd, but to find out exactly what were his practices. He could, upon the information he already had, have walked into Todd\u0027s shop at any time, and have apprehended him, but that would not have answered. What he wanted to do was to \"Pluck out the heart of his mystery,\" and, in order to do that, it was not only necessary that Todd should be at large, but that he should have no hint that such a person as he, Sir Richard Blunt, had his eyes wide open to his actions and manoeuvres. Hence was it that, in this examination of the house, he wished to keep himself so secret, and free from any observation. There were three rooms upon the second floor of Todd\u0027s house, and the very next one they met with, was the one immediately beneath the trap in the floor of the attic. A glance at the ceiling enabled them easily to perceive it. This room was larger than the other considerably, and in it were many boxes and chests, as well as in the centre an immense old-fashioned counting-house desk, with six immense flaps to it, three upon each side, while a brass railing went along the middle. \"Ah!\" said Sir Richard, \"here will be something worth the examining, I hope.\" \"Let\u0027s take the cupboards first,\" said Crotchet. \"There are two here, and as they are the first we have seen, let\u0027s look at \u0027em, Sir Richard. I never likes to be in a strange room long, without a peep in the cupboard.\" \"Very well, Crotchet. Look in that one to the left, while I look in this one to the right.\" Sir Richard opened a cupboard door to the right of the fire-place in this room, while Crotchet opened one to the left. \"More clothes,\" said Sir Richard. \"What\u0027s in yours, Crotchet?\" \"Nothing at all. Yet stay. There\u0027s a something high up here. I don\u0027t know what it is, but I\u0027ll try and reach it if I can.\" Crotchet went completely into the cupboard, but he had no sooner done so, than Sir Richard Blunt heard a strange crushing sound, and then all was still. \"Hilloa! What\u0027s that, Crotchet?\" He hastily stepped to the cupboard. The door had swung close. It was evidently hung upon its hinges in a manner to do so. With his disengaged hand, the magistrate at once pulled it open. Crotchet was gone. The astonishment of Sir Richard Blunt for a moment was excessive. There was the flooring of the cupboard perfectly safe, but no Crotchet. Nothing to his eyes had looked so like a magical disappearance as this, and with the trap in his hand, he stood while any one might have counted twenty, completely motionless and transfixed by astonishment. Starting then from this lethargic condition, he drew a pistol from his pocket, and rushed to the door of the room. At this instant, he heard the bugle sound clearly and distinctly in the street. Before the echo of the sound had died away, the magistrate was upon the landing-place outside the door of the second floor. He listened intently, and heard some one below coughing. It was not the cough of Crotchet. What was he to do? If he did not make a signal to the officers in the street that all was safe, the house would soon be stormed, and, for all he knew, that might ensure the destruction of Crotchet, instead of saving him. For a moment, the resolution to go down the staircase at all hazards and face Todd—for he had no doubt but that he had come home—possessed him, but a moment\u0027s reflection turned the scale of thought in another direction. If the officers, not finding him make a signal that he was safe, did attack the house, they would not do so for some minutes. It was their duty not to be precipitate. He leant on the balustrade, and listened with an intentness that was perfectly painful. He heard the cough again from quite the lower part of the house, and then he became aware that some one was slowly creeping up the stairs. He had placed the slide over the bull\u0027s eye of his little lamp, so that all was darkness, but he heard the breathing of the person who was coming up towards him. He shrunk back close to the wall, determined to seize, and with an iron hand, any one who should reach the landing. Suddenly, from quite the lower part of the building, he heard the cough again. The thought, then, that it must be Crotchet who was coming up, impressed itself upon him, but he would not speak. In a few moments some one reached the landing, and stretching out his right arm, Sir Richard caught whoever it was, and said in a whisper— \"Any resistance will cost you your life.\" \"Crotchet it is,\" said the new comer. \"Ah, how glad I am it is you!\" \"Reether. Hush. The old \u0027un is below. Ain\u0027t I shook a bit. It\u0027s a precious good thing as my bones is in the blessed habit o\u0027 holding on, one of \u0027em to the rest and all the rest to one, or else I should have tumbled to bits.\" \"Hush! hush!\" \"Oh, he\u0027s a good way off. That \u0027ere cupboard has got a descending floor with ropes and pullies, so down I went and was rolled out into a room below and up went the bit of flooring again. I was very nearly startled a little.\" \"Nearly?\" \"Reether, but here I is. I got out and crept up stairs as soon as I could, cos, says I, the governor will wonder what the deuce has become of me.\" \"I did, indeed.\" \"Just as I thought. Sir Richard, just listen to me! I\u0027ve got a fancy for Todd.\" \"A fancy for Todd?\" \"Yes, and I want to stay here a few hours—yes, go and let them as is outside know all\u0027s right, and leave me here, I think somehow I shall like to be in this crib alone with Todd for an hour or two. You have got other business to see to, you know, so just leave me here; and mind yer, if I don\u0027t get here by six in the morning, just consider as he\u0027s got the better of me.\" \"No, Crotchet, I cannot.\" \"Can\u0027t what?\" \"Consent to leave you here alone.\" \"Bother! what\u0027s the row, and where\u0027s the danger, I should like to know? Who\u0027s Todd? Who am I? Gammon!\" Sir Richard shook his head, although Crotchet could not very well see him shake it, and after a pause he added— \"I don\u0027t suppose exactly that there is much danger, Crotchet, but, at all events, I don\u0027t like it said that I brought you into this place and then left you here.\" \"Bother!\" \"You go and leave me.\" \"A likely joke that. No, I tell yer what it is, Sir Richard. You knows me and I knows you, so what does it matter what other folks say? Business is business I hope, and don\u0027t you believe that I\u0027m going to be such a flat as to throw away my life upon such a fellow as Todd. I think I can do some good by staying here; if I can\u0027t I\u0027ll come away, but I don\u0027t think, in either case, that Todd will see me. If he does I shall, perhaps, be forced to nab him, and that, after all, is the worst that can come of it.\" \"Well, Crotchet, you shall have your own way.\" \"Good.\" \"I will return to the attic as soon as I conveniently can, and, let what will happen to you, remember that you are not deserted.\" \"I knows it.\" \"Good bye. Take care of yourself, old friend.\" \"I means it.\" \"I should be indeed afflicted if anything were to happen to you.\" \"Gammon.\" Sir Richard left him his own pistols, in addition to the pair which he, Crotchet, always had about him, so that he was certainly well-armed, let what would happen to him in that house of Sweeney Todd\u0027s, which had now become something more than a mere object of suspicion to the police. Well, they knew Todd\u0027s guilt—it was the mode in which he was guilty only that still remained a mystery. The moment Sir Richard Blunt reached the attic again, he held his arm out at full length from the window, and waved to and fro the little lantern as a signal to the officers in the street that he was safe. This done, he would not return to the room he had hired of the bootmaker, but he resolved to wait about ten minutes longer in case anything should happen in the house below that might sound alarming. After that period of time, he resolved upon leaving for an hour or two, but he, of course, would not do so without apprising his officers of Crotchet\u0027s situation. During the time that had been passed by Crotchet and Sir Richard Blunt in Sweeney Todd\u0027s house, the shoemaker and his wife had had an adventure which created in their minds abundance of surprise. It will be recollected that the shoemaker\u0027s wife had decided upon what was to be done regarding the new lodger—namely, that under the pretence that a Mr. Jones was a more satisfactory lodger, he was to be asked to be so good as to quit the attic he had so strangely taken. The arrival of Mr. Crotchet with so different a story from that told by Sir Richard Blunt certainly had the effect of engendering many suspicions in the minds of Sir Richard\u0027s new landlord and landlady. \"Well, my dear,\" said the shoemaker, \"if you are willing to come up stairs, I will say what you wish to this man, particularly as his pretended friend don\u0027t seem to be coming down stairs again.\" \"Very well, my dear; I\u0027ll take the kitchen poker and follow you, and while I am behind you, if I think he is a pleasant man, you know, and we had better let him stay, I will give you a slight poke.\" \"A-hem! Thank you—yes.\" Armed with the poker, the lady of the mansion followed her husband up the staircase, and perhaps we may fairly say that curiosity was as strong a feeling with her as any other in the business. To tell the truth, the shoemaker did not half like the job; but what will a man, who is under proper control at home, not do to keep up the shallow treaty of peace which his compliance produces between him and his better half? Is there anything which a hen-pecked husband dares say he will not do, when the autocrat of his domestic hearth bids him do it? Up—up the long dark staircase they went! Our ancestors, as one of their pieces of wisdom, had a knack of making steep dark staircases; and, to tell the truth, there are many modern architects equally ingenious. At length the attic landing was reached. The shoemaker knew the localities of his house better than to make such a mistake as Crotchet had done; so the old lady, with her feet in the pan of water, was saved such another interruption as had already taken place into her peaceful domains. \"Now, my dear, knock boldly,\" said the lady of the mansion. \"Knock like a man.\" \"Yes, my love.\" The shoemaker tapped at the door with about the energy of a fly. The soft appeal produced no effect whatever, and the lady growing impatient, then poised the poker, and dealt the door a blow which induced her husband to start aside, lest the lodger should open it quickly, and rush out in great wrath. All was profoundly still, however; and then they tried the lock, and found it fast. \"He\u0027s gone to bed,\" said the shoemaker. \"He can\u0027t,\" said the lady, \"for there are no sheets on the bed. Besides, they have not both gone to bed. I tell you what it is. There\u0027s some mystery in this that I should like to find out. Now, all the keys of all the attics are alike. Just wait here, and I\u0027ll borrow Mrs. Macconikie\u0027s.\" The shoemaker waited in no small amount of trepidation, while this process of key-borrowing from the old lady who enjoyed a pan of water, took place upon the part of his wife.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276/89598.html","bookId":510,"book":{"id":510,"title":"The String of Pearls","description":"简介： The Romance of The String of Pearls having excited in the Literary world an almost unprecedented interest, it behoves the author to say a few words to his readers upon the completion of his labours....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
