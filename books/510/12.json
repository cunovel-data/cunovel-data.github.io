{"id":11984,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XII. THE RESOLUTION COME TO BY JOHANNA OAKLEY.","content":"The beautiful Johanna—when in obedience to the command of her father she left him, and begged him (the beef-eater) to manage matters with the Rev. Mr. Lupin—did not proceed directly up stairs to her apartment, but lingered on the staircase to hear what ensued; and if anything in her dejected state of mind could have given her amusement, it would certainly have been the way in which the beef-eater exacted a retribution from the reverend personage, who was not likely again to intrude himself into the house of the spectacle-maker. But when he was gone, and she heard that a sort of peace had been patched up with her mother—a peace which, from her knowledge of the high contracting parties, she conjectured would not last long—she returned to her room, and locked herself in; so that if any attempt were made to get her down to partake of the supper, it might be supposed she was asleep, for she felt herself totally unequal to the task of making one in any party, however much she might respect the individual members that composed it. And she did respect Ben the beef-eater; for she had a lively recollection of much kindness from him during her early years, and she knew that he had never come to the house when she was a child without bringing her some token of his regard in the shape of a plaything, or some little article of doll\u0027s finery, which at that time was very precious. She was not wrong in her conjectures that Ben would make an attempt to get her down stairs, for her father came up at the beef-eater\u0027s request, and tapped at her door. She thought the best plan, as indeed it was, would be to make no answer, so that the old spectacle-maker concluded at once what she wished him to conclude, namely, that she had gone to sleep; and he walked quietly down the stairs again, glad that he had not disturbed her, and told Ben as much. Now, feeling herself quite secure from interruption for the night, Johanna did not attempt to seek repose, but set herself seriously to reflect upon what had occurred. She almost repeated to herself, word for word, what Colonel Jeffery had told her; and, as she revolved the matter over and over again in her brain, a strange thought took possession of her, which she could not banish, and which, when once it found a home within her breast, began to gather probability from every slight circumstance that was in any way connected with it. This thought, strange as it may appear, was, that the Mr. Thornhill, of whom Colonel Jeffery spoke in terms of such high eulogium, was no other than Mark Ingestrie himself. It is astonishing, when once a thought occurs to the mind, that makes a strong impression, how, with immense rapidity, a rush of evidence will appear to come to support it. And thus it was with regard to this supposition of Johanna Oakley. She immediately remembered a host of little things which favoured the idea, and among the rest, she fully recollected that Mark Ingestrie had told her he meant to change his name when he left England; for that he wished her and her only to know anything of him, or what had become of him; and that his intention was to baffle inquiry, in case it should be made, particularly by Mr. Grant, towards whom he felt a far greater amount of indignation, than the circumstances at all warranted him in feeling. Then she recollected all that Colonel Jeffery had said with regard to the gallant and noble conduct of this Mr. Thornhill, and, girl like, she thought that those high and noble qualities could surely belong to no one but her own lover, to such an extent; and that, therefore, Mr. Thornhill and Mark Ingestrie must be one and the same person. Over and over again, she regretted she had not asked Colonel Jeffery for a personal description of Mr. Thornhill, for that would have settled all her doubts at once, and the idea that she had it still in her power to do so, in consequence of the appointment he had made with her for that day week brought her some consolation. \"It must have been he,\" she said; \"his anxiety to leave the ship, and get here by the day he mentions, proves it; besides, how improbable it is, that at the burning of the ill-fated vessel, Ingestrie should place in the hands of another what he intended for me, when that other was quite as likely, and perhaps more so, to meet with death as Mark himself.\" Thus she reasoned, forcing herself each moment into a stronger belief of the identity of Thornhill with Mark Ingestrie, and so certainly narrowing her anxieties to a consideration of the fate of one person instead of two. \"I will meet Colonel Jeffery,\" she said, \"and ask him if this Mr. Thornhill had fair hair, and a soft and pleasing expression about the eyes, that could not fail to be remembered. I will ask him how he spoke, and how he looked; and get him, if he can, to describe to me even the very tones of his voice; and then I shall be sure, without the shadow of a doubt, that it is Mark. But then, oh! then comes the anxious question, of what has been his fate?\" When poor Johanna began to consider the multitude of things that might have happened to her lover during his progress from Sweeney Todd\u0027s, in Fleet-street, to her father\u0027s house, she became quite lost in a perfect maze of conjecture, and then her thoughts always painfully reverted back to the barber\u0027s shop where the dog had been stationed; and she trembled to reflect for a moment upon the frightful danger to which that string of pearls might have subjected him. \"Alas! alas!\" she cried, \"I can well conceive that the man whom I saw attempting to poison the dog would be capable of any enormity. I saw his face but for a moment, and yet it was one never again to be forgotten. It was a face in which might be read cruelty and evil passions; besides, the man who would put an unoffending animal to a cruel death, shows an absence of feeling, and a baseness of mind, which make him capable of any crime he thinks he can commit with impunity. What can I do—oh! what can I do to unravel this mystery?\" No one could have been more tenderly and gently brought up than Johanna Oakley, but yet, inhabitive of her heart, was a spirit and a determination which few indeed could have given her credit for, by merely looking on the gentle and affectionate countenance which she ordinarily presented. But it is no new phenomenon in the history of the human heart to find that some of the most gentle and loveliest of human creatures are capable of the highest efforts of perversion; and when Johanna Oakley told herself, which she did, she was determined to devote her existence to a discovery of the mystery that enveloped the fate of Mark Ingestrie, she likewise made up her mind that the most likely man for accomplishing that object should not be rejected by her on the score of danger, and she at once set to work considering what those means should be. This seemed an endless task, but still she thought that if, by any means whatever, she could get admittance to the barber\u0027s house, she might be able to come to some conclusion as to whether or not it was there where Thornhill, whom she believed to be Ingestrie, had been stayed in his progress. \"Aid me Heaven,\" she cried, \"in the adoption of some means of action on the occasion. Is there any one with whom I dare advise? Alas! I fear not, for the only person in whom I have put my whole heart is my father, and his affection for me would prompt him at once to interpose every possible obstacle to my proceeding, for fear danger should come of it. To be sure, there is Arabella Wilmot, my old school fellow and bosom friend, she would advise me to the best of her ability, but I much fear she is too romantic and full of odd, strange actions, that she has taken from books, to be a good adviser; and yet what can I do? I must speak to some one, if it be but in case any accident happening to me, my father may get news of it, and I know of no one else whom I can trust but Arabella.\" After some little more consideration, Johanna made up her mind that on the following morning she would go to the house of her old school friend, which was in the immediate vicinity, and hold a conversation with her. \"I shall hear something,\" she said, \"at least of a kindly and a consoling character; for what Arabella may want in calm and steady judgment, she fully compensates for in actual feeling, and what is most of all, I know I can trust her word implicitly, and that my secret will remain as safely locked in her breast as if it were in my own.\" It was something to come to a conclusion to ask advice, and she felt that some portion of her anxiety was lifted from her mind by the mere fact that she had made so firm a mental resolution, that neither danger nor difficulty should deter her from seeking to know the fate of her lover. She retired to rest now with a greater hope, and while she is courting repose, notwithstanding the chance of the discovered images that fancy may present to her in her slumbers, we will take a glance at the parlour below, and see how far Mrs. Oakley is conveying out the pacific intention she had so tacitly expressed, and how the supper is going forward, which, with not the best grace in the world, she is preparing for her husband, who for the first time in his life had begun to assert his rights, and for big Ben, the beef-eater, whom she as cordially disliked as it was possible for any woman to detest any man. Mrs. Oakley by no means preserved her taciturn demeanour, for after a little she spoke, saying— \"There\u0027s nothing tasty in the house; suppose I run over the way to Waggarge\u0027s, and get some of those Epping sausages with the peculiar flavour.\" \"Ah, do,\" said Mr. Oakley, \"they are beautiful, Ben, I can assure you.\" \"Well, I don\u0027t know,\" said Ben the beef-eater, \"sausages are all very well in their way, but you need such a plaguey lot of them; for if you only eat them one at a time, how soon will you get through a dozen or two.\" \"A dozen or two,\" said Mrs. Oakley; \"why, there are only five to a pound.\" \"Then,\" said Ben, making a mental calculation, \"then, I think, ma\u0027am, that you ought not to get more than nine pounds of them, and that will be a matter of forty-five mouthfuls for us.\" \"Get nine pounds of them,\" said Mr. Oakley, \"if they be wanted; I know Ben has an appetite.\" \"Indeed,\" said Ben, \"but I have fell off lately, and don\u0027t take to my wittals as I used; you can order, missus, if you please, a gallon of half-and-half as you go along. One must have a drain of drink of some sort; and mind you don\u0027t be going to any expense on my account, and getting anything but the little snack I have mentioned, for ten to one I shall take supper when I get to the Tower; only human nature is weak, you know, missus, and requires something to be a continually a holding of it up.\" \"Certainly,\" said Mr. Oakley, \"certainly, have what you like, Ben; just say the word before Mrs. Oakley goes out; is there anything else?\" \"No, no,\" said Ben, \"oh dear no, nothing to speak of; but if you should pass a shop where they sells fat bacon, about four or five pounds, cut into rashers, you\u0027ll find, missus, will help down the blessed sausages.\" \"Gracious Providence,\" said Mrs. Oakley, \"who is to cook it?\" \"Who is to cook it, ma\u0027am? why the kitchen fire, I suppose; but mind ye if the man aint got any sausages, there\u0027s a shop where they sells biled beef at the corner, and I shall be quite satisfied if you brings in about ten or twelve pounds of that. You can make it up into about half a dozen sandwiches.\" \"Go, my dear, go at once,\" said Mr. Oakley, \"and get Ben his supper. I am quite sure he wants it, and be as quick as you can.\" \"Ah,\" said Ben, when Mrs. Oakley was gone, \"I didn\u0027t tell you how I was sarved last week at Mrs. Harveys. You know they are so precious genteel there that they don\u0027t speak above their blessed breaths for fear of wearing themselves out; and they sits down in a chair as if it were balanced only on one leg, and a little more one way or t\u0027other would upset them. Then, if they sees a crumb a laying on the floor they rings the bell, and a poor half-starved devil of a servant comes and says, \u0027Did you ring, ma\u0027am?\u0027 and then they says \u0027Yes, bring a dust-shovel and a broom, there is a crumb a laying there,\u0027 and then says I—\u0027Damn you all,\u0027 says I, \u0027bring a scavenger\u0027s cart, and half-dozen birch brooms, there\u0027s a cinder just fell out of the fire.\u0027 Then in course they gets shocked, and looks as blue as possible, and arter that, when they see as I aint agoing, one of them says \u0027Mr. Benjamin Blumergutts, would you like to take a glass of wine?\u0027 \u0027I should think so,\u0027 says I. Then he says, says he, \u0027which would you prefer, red or white?\u0027 says he. \u0027White,\u0027 says I, \u0027while you are screwing up your courage to pull out the red,\u0027 so out they pull it; and as soon as I got hold of the bottle, I knocked the neck of it off over the top bar of the fire-place, and then drank it all up. \u0027Now, damn ye,\u0027 says I, \u0027you thinks all this is mighty genteel and fine, but I don\u0027t, and consider you to be the blessedest set of humbugs ever I set my eyes on; and, if ever you catch me here again, I\u0027ll be genteel too, and I can\u0027t say more than that. Go to the devil, all of ye.\u0027 So out I went, only I met with a little accident in the hall, for they had got a sort of lamp hanging there, and somehow or \u0027nother, my head went bang into it, and I carried it out round my neck; but when I did get out, I took it off, and shied it slap in at the parlour window. You never heard such a smash in all your life. I dare say they all fainted away for about a week, the blessed humbugs.\" \"Well, I should not wonder,\" said Mr. Oakley, \"I never go near them, because I don\u0027t like their foolish pomposity and pride, which, upon very slender resources, tries to ape what it don\u0027t at all understand; but here is Mrs. Oakley with the sausages, and I hope you will make yourself comfortable, Ben.\" \"Comfortable! I believe ye, I rather shall. I means it, and no mistake.\" \"I have brought three pounds,\" said Mrs. Oakley, \"and told the man to call in a quarter of an hour, in case there is any more wanted.\" \"The devil you have; and the bacon, Mrs. Oakley, the bacon!\" \"I could not get any—the man had nothing but hams.\" \"Lor\u0027, ma\u0027am, I\u0027d put up with a ham cut thick, and never have said a word about it. I am a angel of a temper, and if you did but know it. Hilloa, look, is that the fellow with the half-and half?\" \"Yes, here it is—a pot.\" \"A what?\" \"A pot, to be sure.\" \"Well, I never; you are getting genteel, Mrs. Oakley. Then give us a hold of it.\" Ben took the pot, and emptied it at a draught, and then he gave a tap at the bottom of it with his knuckles, to signify that he had accomplished that feat, and then he said, \"I tells you what, ma\u0027am, if you takes me for a baby, it\u0027s a great mistake, and any one would think you did, to see you offering me a pot merely; it\u0027s an insult, ma\u0027am.\" \"Fiddle-de-dee,\" said Mrs. Oakley; \"it\u0027s a much greater insult to drink it all up, and give nobody a drop.\" \"Is it? I wants to know how you are to stop it, ma\u0027am, when you gets it to your mouth? that\u0027s what I axes you—how are you to stop it, ma\u0027am? You didn\u0027t want me to spew it back again, did you, eh, ma\u0027am?\" \"You vile, low wretch!\" \"Come, come, my dear,\" said Mr. Oakley, \"you know our cousin. Ben don\u0027t live among the most refined society, and so you ought to be able to look over a little of—of—his—I may say, I am sure, without offence, roughness now and then;—come, come, there is no harm done, I\u0027m sure. Forget and forgive say I. That\u0027s my maxim, and has always been, and will always be.\" \"Well,\" said the beef-eater, \"it\u0027s a good one to get through the world with, and so there\u0027s an end of it. I forgives you, Mother Oakley.\" \"You forgive—\" \"Yes, to be sure. Though I am only a beaf-eater, I suppose as I may forgive people for all that—eh, Cousin Oakley?\" \"Oh, of course, Ben, of course. Come, come, wife, you know as well as I that Ben has many good qualities, and that take him for all in all, as the man in the play says, we shan\u0027t in a hurry look upon his like again.\" \"And I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t want to look upon his like again,\" said Mrs. Oakley; \"I\u0027d rather by a good deal keep him a week than a fortnight. He\u0027s enough to breed a famine in the land, that he is.\" \"Oh, bless you, no,\" said Ben, \"that\u0027s amongst your little mistakes, ma\u0027am, I can assure you. By the bye, what a blessed long time that fellow is coming with the rest of the beer and the other sausages—why, what\u0027s the matter with you, cousin Oakley—eh, old chap, you look out of sorts?\" \"I don\u0027t feel just the thing, do you know, Ben.\" \"Not—the thing—why—why, now you come to mention it, I somehow feel as if all my blessed inside was on a turn and a twist. The devil—I—don\u0027t feel comfortable at all I don\u0027t.\" \"And I\u0027m getting very ill,\" gasped Mr. Oakley. \"And I\u0027m getting iller,\" said the beef-eater, manufacturing a word for the occasion. \"Bless my soul! there\u0027s something gone wrong in my inside. I know there\u0027s murder—there\u0027s a go—oh, Lord! it\u0027s a doubling me up, it is.\" \"I feel as if my last hour had come,\" said Mr. Oakley—\"I\u0027m a—a—dying man—I am—oh, good gracious! there was a twinge!\" Mrs. Oakley, with all the coolness in the world, took down her bonnet from behind the parlour-door where it hung, and, as she put it on said,— \"I told you both that some judgment would come over you, and now you see it has. How do you like it? Providence is good, of course, to its own, and I have—\" \"What—what—?\" \"Pisoned the half-and-half.\" Big Ben, the beef-eater, fell off his chair with a deep groan, and poor Mr. Oakley sat glaring at his wife, and shivering with apprehension, quite unable to speak, while she placed a shawl over her shoulders, as she added in the same tone of calmness she had made the terrific announcement concerning the poisoning— \"Now, you wretches, you see what a woman can do when she makes up her mind for vengeance. As long as you all live, you\u0027ll recollect me; but, if you don\u0027t, that won\u0027t much matter, for you won\u0027t live long, I can tell you, and now I\u0027m going to my sister\u0027s, Mrs. Tiddiblow.\" So saying, Mrs. Oakley turned quickly round, and, with an insulting toss of her head, and not at all caring for the pangs and sufferings of her poor victims, she left the place, and proceeded to her sister\u0027s house, where she slept as comfortably as if she had not by any means committed two diabolical murders. But has she done so, or shall we, for the honour of human nature, discover that she went to a neighbouring chemist\u0027s, and only purchased some dreadfully powerful medicinal compound, which she placed in the half-and-half, and which began to give those pangs to Big Ben, the beef-eater, and to Mr. Oakley, concerning which they were both so eloquent? This must have been the case; for Mrs. Oakley could not have been such a fiend in a human guise as to laugh as she passed the chemist\u0027s shop. Oh no! she might not have felt remorse, but that is a very different thing, indeed, from laughing at the matter, unless it were really laughable and not serious, at all. Big Ben and Mr. Oakley must have at length found out how they had been hoaxed, and the most probable thing was that the before-mentioned chemist himself told them; for they sent for him in order to know if anything could be done to save their lives. Ben from that day forthwith made a determination that he would not visit Mr. Oakley, and the next time they met he said— \"I tell you what it is, that old hag, your wife, is one too many for us, that\u0027s a fact; she gets the better of me altogether—so, whenever you feels a little inclined for a gossip about old times, just you come down to the Tower.\" \"I will, Ben.\" \"Do; we can always find something to drink, and you can amuse yourself, too, by looking at the animals. Remember, feeding time is two o\u0027clock; so, now and then, I shall expect to see you, and, above all, be sure you let me know if that canting parson, Lupin, comes any more to your house.\" \"I will, Ben.\" \"Ah, do; and I\u0027ll give him another lesson if he should, and I tell you how I\u0027ll do it. I\u0027ll get a free admission to the wild beastesses in the Tower, and when he comes to see \u0027em, for them \u0027ere sort of fellows always goes everywhere they can go for nothing, I\u0027ll just manage to pop him into a cage along of some of the most cantankerous creatures as we have.\" \"But would not that be dangerous?\" \"Oh dear no! we has a laughing hyaena as would frighten him out of his wits; but I don\u0027t think as he\u0027d bite him much, do you know. He\u0027s as playful as a kitten, and very fond of standing on his head.\" \"Well, then, Ben, I have, of course, no objection, although I do think that the lesson you have already given to the reverend gentleman will and ought to be fully sufficient for all purposes, and I don\u0027t expect we shall see him again.\" \"But how does Mrs. O. behave to you?\" asked Ben. \"Well, Ben, I don\u0027t think there\u0027s much difference; sometimes she\u0027s a little civil, and sometimes she ain\u0027t; it\u0027s just as she takes it into her head.\" \"Ah! that all comes of marrying.\" \"I have often wondered, though, Ben, that you never married.\" Ben gave a chuckle as he replied— \"Have you though, really? Well, Cousin Oakley, I don\u0027t mind telling you, but the real fact is, once I was very near being served out in that sort of way.\" \"Indeed!\" \"Yes. I\u0027ll tell you how it was; there was a girl called Angelina Day, and a nice-looking enough creature she was as you\u0027d wish to see, and didn\u0027t seem as if she\u0027d got any claws at all; leastways she kept them in, like a cat at meal times.\" \"Upon my word, Ben, you have a great knowledge of the world.\" \"I believe you, I have! Haven\u0027t I been brought up among the wild beasts in the Tower all my life? That\u0027s the place to get a knowledge of the world in, my boy. I ought to know a thing or two, and in course I does.\" \"Well, but how was it, Ben, that you did not marry this Angelina you speak of?\" \"I\u0027ll tell you; she thought she had me as safe as a hare in a trap, and she was as amiable as a lump of cotton. You\u0027d have thought, to look at her, that she did nothing but smile; and, to hear her, that she said nothing but nice, mild, pleasant things, and I really began to think as I had found out the proper sort of animal.\" \"But you were mistaken?\" \"I believe you, I was. One day I\u0027d been there to see her, I mean, at her father\u0027s house, and she\u0027d been as amiable as she could be; I got up to go away, with a determination that the next time I got there I would ask her to say yes, and when I had got a little way out of the garden of the house where they lived—it was out of town some distance—I found I had left my little walking-cane behind me, so I goes back to get it, and when I got into the garden I heard a voice.\" \"Whose voice?\" \"Why Angelina\u0027s, to be sure; she was speaking to a poor little dab of a servant they had; and oh, my eye! how she did rap out, to be sure! Such a speech as I never heard in all my life. She went on a matter of ten minutes without stopping, and every other word was some ill name or another; and her voice—oh, gracious! it was like a bundle of wire all of a tangle—it was.\" \"And what did you do, then, upon making such a discovery as that in so very odd and unexpected a manner?\" \"Do! What do you suppose I did?\" \"I really cannot say, as you are rather an eccentric fellow.\" \"Well then, I\u0027ll tell you. I went up to the house, and just popped in my head, and says I, \u0027Angelina, I find out that all cats have claws after all; good evening, and no more from your humble servant, who don\u0027t mind the job of taming any wild animal but a woman;\u0027 and then off I walked, and I never heard of her afterwards.\" \"Ah, Ben, it\u0027s true enough! You never know them beforehand; but after a little time, as you say, then out come the claws.\" \"They does—they does.\" \"And I suppose you since, then, made up your mind to be a bachelor for the rest of your life, Ben?\" \"Of course I did. After such experience as that, I should have deserved all I got, and no mistake, I can tell you; and if ever you catches me paying any attention to a female woman, just put me in mind of Angelina Day, and you\u0027ll see how I shall be off at once like a shot.\" \"Ah!\" said Mr. Oakley, with a sigh, \"everybody, Ben, aint born with your good luck, I can tell you. You are a most fortunate man, Ben, and that\u0027s a fact. You must have been born under some lucky planet I think, Ben, or else you never would have had such a warning as you have had about the claws. I found \u0027em out, Ben, but it was a deal too late; so I had only to put up with my fate, and put the best face I could upon the matter.\" \"Yes, that\u0027s what learned folks call—what\u0027s its name—fill—fill—something.\" \"Philosophy, I suppose you mean, Ben.\" \"Ah, that\u0027s it—you must put up with what you can\u0027t help, it means, I take it. It\u0027s a fine name for saying you must grin and bear it.\" \"I suppose that is about the truth, Ben.\" It cannot, however, be exactly said that the little incident connected with Mr. Lupin had no good effect upon Mrs. Oakley, for it certainly shook most alarmingly her confidence in that pious individual. In the first place, it was quite clear that he shrank from the horrors of martyrdom; and, indeed, to escape any bodily inconvenience, was perfectly willing to put up with any amount of degradation or humiliation that he could be subjected to; and that was, to the apprehension of Mrs. Oakley, a great departure from what a saint ought to be. Then again, her faith in the fact that Mr. Lupin was such a chosen morsel as he had represented himself, was shaken from the circumstance that no miracle in the shape of a judgment had taken place to save him from the malevolence of Big Ben, the beef-eater; so that, taking one thing in connexion with another, Mrs. Oakley was not near so religious a character after that evening as she had been before it, and that was something gained. Then circumstances soon occurred, of which the reader will very shortly be fully aware, which were calculated to awaken all the feelings of Mrs. Oakley, if she had really any feelings to awaken, and to force her to make common cause with her husband in an affair that touched him to the very soul, and did succeed in awakening some feelings in her heart that had lain dormant for a long time, but which were still far from being completely destroyed. These circumstances were closely connected with the fate of one in whom we hope, that by this time, the reader has taken a deep and kindly interest—we mean Johanna—that young and beautiful, and gentle, creature, who seemed to have been created with all the capacity to be so very happy, and yet whose fate had become so clouded by misfortune, and who appears now to be doomed through her best affections to suffer so great an amount of sorrow, and to go through so many sad difficulties. Alas, poor Johanna Oakley! Better had you loved some one of less aspiring feelings, and of less ardent imagination, than he possessed to whom you have given your heart\u0027s young affections. It is true that Mark Ingestrie possessed genius, and perhaps it was the glorious light that hovers around that fatal gift which prompted you to love him. But genius is not only a blight and a desolation to its possessor, but it is so to all who are bound to the gifted being by the ties of fond affection. It brings with it that unhappy restlessness of intellect which is ever straining after the unattainable, and which is never content to know the end and ultimatum of earthly hopes and wishes; no, the whole life of such persons is spent in one long struggle for a fancied happiness, which like the ignis-fatuus of the swamp glitters but to betray those who trust to its delusive and flickering beams. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276/89569.html","bookId":510,"book":{"id":510,"title":"The String of Pearls","description":"简介： The Romance of The String of Pearls having excited in the Literary world an almost unprecedented interest, it behoves the author to say a few words to his readers upon the completion of his labours....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
