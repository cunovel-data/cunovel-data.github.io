{"id":12019,"no":47,"title":"CHAPTER XLV. JOHANNA\u0027S NEW SITUATION.","content":"\"Johanna, attend to me,\" said Mrs. Oakley, upon the morning after these events. \"Well, mother?\" \"Your father is an idiot.\" \"Mother, mother! I dissent from the opinion, and if it were true, it comes with the worst possible grace from you, but I am sick at heart. I pray you to spare me reproaches or angry words, mother.\" \"Haity taity, one must not speak next, I suppose. Some people fancy that other people know nothing, but there is such a thing as overhearing what some people say to other people.\" Johanna had not the most remote notion of what her mother meant, but Mrs. Oakley\u0027s tongue was like many pieces of machinery, that when once set in motion are not without considerable trouble brought to a standstill again, so on she went. \"Of course. I now know quite well why the godly man who would have made you a chosen vessel was refused. It was all owing to that scamp, Mark Ingestrie.\" \"Mother!\" \"Marry come up! you need not look at me in such a way. We don\u0027t all of us see with the same eyes. A scamp he is, and a scamp he will be.\" \"Mother, he whom you so name is with his God. Mention him no more. The wild ocean rolls over his body—his soul is in heaven. Speak not irreverently of one whose sole crime was that he loved me. Oh, mother, mother, you—\" Johanna could say no more, she burst into tears. \"Well,\" said Mrs. Oakley, \"if he is dead, pray what hinders you from listening to the chosen vessel, I should like to know?\" \"Do not. Oh do not, mother, say any more to me—I cannot, dare not trust myself to speak to you upon such a subject.\" \"What is this?\" said Mr. Oakley, stepping into the room. \"Johanna in tears! What has happened?\" Mr. Oakley Defends Johanna From The Violence Of Her Mother. Mr. Oakley Defends Johanna From The Violence Of Her Mother. \"Father—dear father!\" \"And Mr. O.,\" cried Mrs. Oakley, \"what business is it of yours, I should like to know? Be so good, sir, as to attend to your spectacles, and such like rubbish, and not to interfere with my daughter.\" \"Dear me!—ain\u0027t she my daughter likewise?\" \"Oh yes, Mr. O.! Go on with your base, vile, wretched, contemptible, unmanly insinuations. Do go on, pray—I like it. Oh, you odious wretch! You spectacle-making monster!\" \"Do not,\" cried Johanna, who saw the heightened colour of her father\u0027s cheek. \"Oh, do not let me be the unhappy cause of any quarrelling. Father! father!\" \"Hush, my dear, don\u0027t you say another word. Cousin Ben is coming to take a little bit of lunch with us to-day.\" \"I know it,\" cried Mrs. Oakley, clapping her hands together with a vengeance that made Oakley jump again. \"I know it. Oh, you wretch. You couldn\u0027t have put on such airs if your bully had not been coming; I thought the last time he came here was enough for him. Aye, and for you too, Mr. O.\" \"It was nearly too much,\" said the spectacle-maker, shaking his head. \"Tow row, row, row, row!\" cried Big Ben, popping his head into the parlour, \"what do you all bring it in now? Wilful murder with the chill off or what? Ah, mother Oakley, what\u0027s the price of vinegar now, wholesale—pluck does it. Here you is. Ha, ha! Aint we a united family. Couldn\u0027t stay away from you, Mother Oakley, no more nor I could from that ere laughing hyena we has in the Tower.\" \"Eugh!—wretch!\" \"Sit down, Ben,\" said Mr. Oakley. \"I am glad to see you, and I am quite sure Johanna is.\" \"Oh, yes, yes.\" \"That\u0027s it,\" said Ben. \"It\u0027s on Johanna\u0027s account I came. Now, little one, just tell me—\" Johanna had just time to place her finger upon her lips, unobserved by any one, and shake her head at Ben. \"Ah—hem! How are you, eh?\" he said, turning the conversation. \"Come, Mother O., stir your old stumps and be alive, will you? I have come to lunch with your lord and master, so bustle—bustle.\" Mrs. Oakley rose, and placing her hands upon her hips, she looked at Ben, as she said— \"You great, horrid, man-mountain of a wretch. I only wonder you ain\u0027t afraid, after the proper punishment you had on the occasion of your last visit, to show your horrid face here again?\" \"You deludes to the physicking, I suppose, mum. Lor bless you, it did us no end of good; but, howsomedever, we provide agin wice in animals when we knows on it aforehand, do you see. Oh, there you is.\" A boy howled out from the shop—\"Did a gentleman order two gallons of half-and-half here, please?\" \"All\u0027s right,\" said Ben. \"Now, Mother O., the only thing I\u0027ll trouble you for, is a knife and fork. As for the rest of the combustibles, here they is.\" Ben took from one capacious pocket a huge parcel, containing about six pounds of boiled beef, and from the other he took as much ham. \"Hold hard!\" he cried to the boy who brought the beer. \"Take this half-crown, my lad, and get three quartern loaves.\" \"But, Ben,\" said old Mr. Oakley, \"I really had no intention, when I asked you to come to lunch this morning, of making you provide it yourself. We have, or we ought to have, plenty of everything in the house.\" \"Old birds,\" said Ben, \"isn\u0027t to be caught twice. A fellow, arter he has burnt his fingers, is afeard o\u0027 playing with the fire. No, Mrs. O., you gave us a benefit last time, and I ain\u0027t a-going to try my luck again. All\u0027s right—pitch into the grub. How is the chosen vessel, Mother O.? All right, eh?\" Mrs. Oakley waited until Ben had made an immense sandwich of ham and beef; and then in an instant, before he was aware of what she was about, she caught it up, and slapped it in his face with a vengeance that was quite staggering. \"Easy does it,\" said Ben. \"Take that, you great, fat elephant.\" \"Go it—go it.\" Mrs. Oakley bounced out of the room. Johanna looked her sorrow; and Mr. Oakley rose from his chair, but Ben made him sit down again, saying— \"Easy does it—easy does it. Never mind her, cousin Oakley. She must have her way sometimes. Let her kick and be off. There\u0027s no harm done—not a bit. Lord bless you. I\u0027m used to all sorts of cantankerous animals.\" Mr. Oakley shook his head. \"Forget it, father,\" said Johanna. \"I only wish, my dear, I could forget many things; and yet there are so many others, that I want to remember, mixed up with them, that I don\u0027t know how I should manage to separate them one from the other.\" \"You couldn\u0027t do it,\" said Ben. \"Here\u0027s luck in a bag, and shake it out as you want it.\" This sentiment was uttered while Ben\u0027s head was deep in the recesses of the two-gallon can of beer, so that it had a peculiar solemn and sonorous effect with it. After drinking about a quart, Ben withdrew the can, and drew a long breath. \"Has he brought yours?\" he said. \"What?—who?\" \"Why the other two gallons for you and Johanna.\" \"Good gracious, Ben, you don\u0027t mean that?\" \"Don\u0027t I, though. Oh, here he is. All\u0027s right. Now, my lad, get the little pint jug, with the silver top to it, and if we don\u0027t mull a drop, I\u0027m a sinner. Now, you\u0027ll see if Mrs. O. don\u0027t come round quite handsome.\" Ben, by the aid of some sugar, succeeded in making a very palatable drink, and just as the steam began to salute the nostrils of old Oakley and himself, the door of the parlour was opened, and who should heedlessly step into the room but the pious Mr. Lupin himself. Mr. Lupin was so transfixed by finding Ben there, that for a moment or two he could not gather strength to retreat; and during that brief period, Ben had shifted his chair, until he got quite behind the reverend gentleman, who, when he did step back, in consequence fell into Ben\u0027s lap. \"What do yer mean?\" cried Ben, in a voice of thunder. \"Oh, murder—murder! Have mercy upon me! I only looked in as I was passing, to ask how all the family was.\" \"Yes,\" said Mr. Oakley, \"and because you, no doubt, heard I was going to Tottenham, to Judge Merivale\u0027s, to fit him with a pair of spectacles.\" \"Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Let me go, sir.\" \"I don\u0027t want you,\" said Ben; \"but as you are here, let\u0027s make an end of all differences, and have a pint together.\" \"A pint?\" \"Yes, to be sure. By the look of your nose, I should say it knows pretty well what a pint is.\" \"Oh, dear—man is sinful alway. I bear no malice, and if the truly right-minded and pious Mrs. Oakley was only here, we might drink down all differences, Mr. a—a—\" \"Ben.\" \"Mr. Ben. Thank you, sir.\" \"Oh, Mr. Lupin,\" cried Mrs. Oakley, at this moment bursting into the parlour. \"Is it possible that you can give your mind in this way to the Philistines? Is not this backsliding?\" \"Let us hope for the best, sister,\" said Mr. Lupin, with an evangelical twang. \"Let us hope for the best. If people will drink, they had much better drink with the saints, who may take some favourable opportunity of converting them, than with sinners.\" \"Sit down, mum,\" said Ben, \"and let\u0027s bury all animosities in the can. Easy does it. Don\u0027t you go, Johanna.\" \"Yes, but, Ben, I—\" \"Now don\u0027t.\" Ben saw by the direction of Johanna\u0027s eyes, that the Rev. gentleman was resting one of his red raw-looking hands upon her arm, and, situated as she was, she could not get out of his way but by rising. \"Sit still,\" said Ben. \"Easy does it.\" Lifting up the can, then, he pretended to drink out of it, and then brought it with such a thundering crack upon Mr. Lupin\u0027s head, that it quite staggered him. \"Paws off,\" said Ben. \"Just attend to that ere gentle hint, old friend.\" Mr. Lupin sat down with a groan. \"Now, mum,\" said Ben, who all the while had held fast the stone mug of mulled porter. \"Now, mum, here\u0027s some hot, that don\u0027t suit me so well as the cold, perhaps you and Mr. Lupin will take that, while I cuts a few more sandwiches.\" He placed the jug before Mr. Lupin, who thereupon left off rubbing his head, and said— \"I\u0027m sure it would be highly unchristian of me to bear any malice, so, with the Lord\u0027s leave, I will even partake of some of this worldly liquor, called mulled porter.\" Now while Mr. Lupin drank the savoury stream from the jug, it assailed the senses of Mrs. Oakley, and when the porter was placed before her, she raised it to her lips, saying— \"If folks are civil to me, I\u0027m civil to them, only I don\u0027t like my godly friends to be ill-treated. I\u0027m sure nobody knows what I have gone through for my family, and nobody thinks what a mother and wife I have been. What would have become of Oakley if it hadn\u0027t been for me, is a question I often ask myself in the middle of the night?\" \"She\u0027s a wonderful woman,\" sighed Lupin. \"Oh, uncommon,\" said Ben. \"Let me go,\" whispered Johanna to Ben. \"No, no! Wait for the fun.\" \"What fun?\" \"Oh, you\u0027ll see. You don\u0027t know what a trouble it has cost me, to be sure. Only wait a bit, there\u0027s a duck, do.\" Johanna did not like to say she would not, so she shrunk back in her chair in no small curiosity, to know what was about to happen. Mrs. Oakley lifted the jug to her lips and drunk deep. The aroma of the liquor must have been peculiarly grateful to the palate of Mrs. Oakley, for she certainly kept the jug at her mouth for a length of time, that, to judge by the look of impatience upon the countenance of Mr. Lupin, was something outrageous. \"Sister!\" he said. \"Mind your breath.\" Down came the jug, and Mrs. Oakley, when she could draw breath, gasped— \"Very good indeed. A dash of allspice would make it delicious.\" \"Oh, sister,\" cried Lupin as he grasped the jug, that was gently pushed towards him by Ben after Mrs. Oakley had set it down. \"Oh, sister, don\u0027t give your mind to carnal things, I beg of you. Why, she\u0027s drank it all.\" Mr. Lupin peered into the jug. He shut the right eye and looked in with the left, and then he shut the left eye and looked in with the right, and then he moved the jug about until the silver lid came down with a clap, that nearly snapped his nose off. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" said Ben. \"I—I—don\u0027t exactly—\" Mr. Lupin raised the lid again and again, and peered into the jug in something of the fashion which popular belief supposes a crow to look into a marrow bone. At length he turned the jug upside down, and struck the bottom of it with his pious knuckles. A huge toad fell sprawling upon the table. Mrs. Oakley gave a shriek, and rushed into the yard. Mr. Lupin gave a groan, and flew into the street, and the party in the parlour could hear them in a state of horrible sickness. \"Easy does it,\" said Ben, \"it\u0027s only a piece of wood shaped like a toad and painted, that\u0027s all. Now I\u0027m easy. I owed \u0027em one.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276/89604.html","bookId":510,"book":{"id":510,"title":"The String of Pearls","description":"简介： The Romance of The String of Pearls having excited in the Literary world an almost unprecedented interest, it behoves the author to say a few words to his readers upon the completion of his labours....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
