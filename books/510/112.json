{"id":12084,"no":112,"title":"CHAPTER CIX. JOHANNA HAS PLENTY OF COMPANY AT TODD\u0027S.","content":"We return to Johanna, whom for a few hours, owing to the pressure of other circumstances, we have been compelled, with all manner of reluctance, to neglect. Recent events, although they had by no manner of means tended to decrease the just confidence which Johanna had in her own safety, had yet much agitated her; and she at times feared that she should not be able to carry on the farce of composure before Todd much longer. \"Charley, my dear boy,\" said Todd, \"you are a very good lad, indeed, and I like you.\" \"I am very glad to hear you say so, sir—very glad.\" \"That is right; but when I say I like any one, I do not confine myself to that mere expression of liking, and there an end. Of course, as a religious man, I love my enemies, and feel myself bound to do so—eh, Charley?\" \"Of course, sir.\" Poor Johanna had no resource but to seem to be deceived by this most disgusting hypocrisy. \"But although,\" continued Todd, waving a razor in the air; \"although I may love my enemies, I need not to go out of my way, you know, Charley, to do good things to them as I would to my friends; but you I will do all I can for; and as it may very materially help you to get an honest independence in the course of a little time, I will manage to accommodate you with sleeping here to-night and all nights henceforth.\" \"How kind of you, sir!\" \"I am glad you appreciate it, Charley; and I feel quite sure that your slumber will be most profound.\" Todd, upon this, made one of his diabolical faces, and then, taking his hat, he marched out, merely adding as he crossed the threshold of the door— \"I shall not be long gone, Charley.\" The day was on the decline, and a strong impression came over Johanna\u0027s mind that something in particular would happen before it wholly passed away into darkness. She almost trembled to think what that something could be, and that she might be compelled to be a witness to violence, from which her gentle spirit revolted; and had it not been that she had determined nothing should stop her from investigating the fate of poor Mark Ingestrie, she could even then have rushed into the street in despair. But as the soft daylight deepened into the dim shadows of evening, she grew more composed, and was better able, with a calmer spirit, to wait the progress of events. \"I am alone once more,\" said Johanna, \"in this dreadful place. Again he leaves me with all my dark and terrible thoughts of the fate of him whom I have so fondly loved thronging around my heart; and this night, no doubt, he thinks to kill me! Oh, Mark Ingestrie! if I were only but quite sure that you had gone to that world from whence there is no return, I think I could, with scarce a sigh, let this dreadful man send me after you!\" Johanna rested her head upon her hands, and wept bitterly. Suddenly a voice close to her said— \"St. Dunstan.\" She sprang from the little low seat upon which she was, and, with a cry of alarm, was about to make a rush from the shop, when the intruder caught her by the arm, saying— \"Don\u0027t you know me, Johanna?\" \"Ah, Sir Richard! my dear friend, it is, indeed, you, and I am safe again—I am safe!\" \"Certainly you are safe; and permit me to say that you have all along been tolerably safe, Johanna. But how very incautious you are. Here I have come into the shop, and actually stood by you for some few moments, you knowing nothing of it! What now if Todd had so come in?\" \"He would have killed me.\" \"He might have done so. But now all danger is quite over, for you will have protectors at your hand. Do you know where Todd has gone?\" \"I do not.\" \"Well, it don\u0027t matter. Let me look at this largest cupboard. I wonder if it will hold two of my men? Let me see. Oh, yes, easily and comfortably. I will be back in a moment.\" He went no further than the door, and when he came back, he brought with him Mr. Crotchet and another person, and pointing to the cupboard, he said— \"You will stow yourselves there, if you please, and keep quiet until I call upon you to come out.\" \"I believe you,\" said Crotchet. \"Lord bless you, we shall be snug enough. How is you, Miss O.? I suppose by this time you feels quite at home in your breech—\" \"Silence!\" said Sir Richard. \"Go to your duty at once, Crotchet. Miss Oakley is in no humour to attend to you just now.\" Upon this, Mr. Crotchet and the other man got into the cupboard, and a chair was placed against it; and then Sir Richard said to Johanna— \"I will come in to be shaved when I know that Todd is here, and your trials will soon be over.\" \"To be shaved?—By him?\" \"Yes. But believe me there is no danger. Any one may come here now to be shaved with perfect safety. I have made such arrangements that Todd cannot take another life.\" \"Thank Heaven!\" \"Here is a letter from your friend, Miss Wilmot, which I promised her I would deliver to you. Be careful how you let Todd see it. Read it at once, and then you had better destroy it at once. I must go now; but, of course, if you should be in any danger, call upon my men in the cupboard to assist you, and they will do so at once, although it may spoil my plot a little.\" \"Oh! how much I owe you.\" \"Nay, nay, no more upon that head. Farewell now, for a brief space. We shall very soon meet again. Keep a fair and agreeable face to Todd, if you can, for I do not wish, if it can possibly be helped, anything to mar the plot I have got up for his absolute conviction upon abundant testimony.\" Sir Richard shook hands with Johanna, and then hastily left the shop, for he did not wish just then to be found there by Todd, who might return at any moment. The moment he was gone Johanna eagerly opened the letter that had been brought to her, and found it to contain the following words:— \"My Dear Johanna,—This is a selfish letter; for as I cannot see you, I think I should go mad if I did not write to you; so I do so for the ease of my own heart and brain. For the love of Heaven, and for the love of all you hold dear in this world, get away from Todd as quickly as you can; and when I see you again, I shall have something to say to you which will give you more pleasure than ever, with my bad advice, I have given you pain. \"Sir Richard Blunt has kindly promised to give this to you, and you know that I am—Your ever affectionate Arabella.\" \"Yes,\" said Johanna, when she had finished the epistle. \"In truth I know you are ever my affectionate Arabella, and I am most happy in such a friend. But this must not meet Todd\u0027s eye. Ah! that footstep, I know it too well. He comes—he comes.\" She had just hidden the letter, when Sweeney Todd made his appearance. \"Anybody been?\" he asked. \"Yes, one man, but he would not wait.\" \"Ah, wanted to be shaved, I suppose; but no matter—no matter; and I hope you have been quiet, and not been attempting to indulge your curiosity in any way, since I have been gone. Hush! here\u0027s somebody coming. Why, it\u0027s old Mr. Wrankley, the tobacconist, I declare. Good-day to you, sir—shaved, I suppose? I\u0027m glad you have come, sir, for I have been out till this moment. Hot water, Charley, directly, and hand me that razor.\" Johanna, in handing Todd the razor, knocked the edge of it against the chair, and it being uncommonly sharp, cut a great slice of the wood off one of the arms of it. \"What shameful carelessness,\" said Todd; \"I have half a mind to lay the strop over your back, sir; here you have spoilt a capital razor—not a bit of edge left upon it.\" \"Oh, excuse him, Mr. Todd—excuse him,\" said the old gentleman; \"he\u0027s only a little lad, after all. Let me intercede for him.\" \"Very good, sir; if you wish me to look over it, of course I will; and, thank God, we have a stock of razors, of course, always at hand. Is there any news stirring, sir?\" \"Nothing that I know of, Mr. Todd, except it\u0027s the illness of Mr. Cummings, the overseer. They say he got home about twelve to his own house, in Chancery-lane, and ever since then he has been as sick as a dog, and all they can get him to say is, \u0027Oh, those pies—oh, those pies!\u0027\" \"Very odd, sir.\" \"Very. I think Mr. Cummings must be touched in the upper story, do you know, Mr. Todd. He\u0027s a very respectable man, but, between you and I, was never over bright.\" \"Certainly not, sir—certainly not. But it\u0027s a very odd case. What pies can he possibly mean, sir? Did you call when you came from home?\" \"No. Ha, ha! I can\u0027t help laughing; but, ha, ha! I have come away from home on the sly, you see. The fact is, my wife\u0027s cousin—hilloa!—I think you have cut me.\" \"No, no—we can\u0027t cut anybody for three-halfpence, sir. I think I will just give you another lather, sir, before I polish you off. And so you have the pearls with you; well, how odd things come round, to be sure.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"This shaving-brush is just in a good state now. Always as a shaving-brush is on the point of wearing out, it\u0027s the best. Charley, you will go at once to Mr. Cummings, and ask if he is any better; you need not hurry, that\u0027s a good lad. I am not at all angry with you now. And so, sir, they think at home that you have gone after some business over the water, do they, and have not the least idea that you have come to be shaved? There, be off, Charley—shut the door, that\u0027s a good lad, bless you.\" When Johanna came back, the tobacconist was gone. \"Well,\" said Sweeney Todd, as he sharpened a razor very leisurely, \"how is Mr. Cummings?\" \"I found out his house, sir, with some difficulty, and they say he is better having gone to sleep.\" \"Oh, very good! I am going to look over some accounts in the parlour, so don\u0027t choose to be disturbed, you understand; and for the next ten minutes, if anybody comes, you will say I am out.\" Sweeney Todd walked quite coolly into the parlour, and Johanna heard him lock the door on the inside; a strange, undefined sensation of terror crept over her, she knew not why, and she shuddered, as she looked around her. The cupboard door was not close shut, and she knew not what prompted her to approach and peep in. On the first shelf was the hat of the tobacconist: it was rather a remarkable one, and recognised in a moment. \"What has happened? Good God! what can have happened?\" thought Johanna, as she staggered back, until she reached the shaving-chair, into which she cast herself for support. Her eyes fell upon the arm which she had taken such a shaving off with the razor, but all was perfectly whole and correct; there was not the least mark of the cut that so recently had been given to it; and lost in wonder, Johanna, for more than a minute, continued looking for the mark of the injury she knew could not have been, by any possibility, effaced. And yet she found it not, although there was the chair, just as usual, with its wide spreading arms and its worn, tarnished paint and gilding. No wonder that Johanna rubbed her eyes, and asked herself if she were really awake? What could account for such a phenomenon? The chair was a fixture too, and the others in the shop were of a widely different make and construction, so it could not have been changed. \"Alas! alas!\" mourned Johanna, \"my mind is full of horrible surmises, and yet I can form no rational conjecture. I suspect everything, and know nothing. What can I do? What ought I to do, to relieve myself from this state of horrible suspense? Am I really in a place where, by some frightful ingenuity, murder has become bold and familiar, or can it be all a delusion?\" She covered her face with her hands for a time, and when she uncovered them, she saw that Sweeney Todd was staring at her with looks of suspicion from the inner room. The necessity of instantly acting her part came over Johanna, and she gave a loud scream. \"What the devil is all this about?\" said Todd, advancing with a sinister expression. \"What\u0027s the meaning of it? I suspect—\" \"Yes, sir,\" said Johanna, \"and so do I; I must to-morrow have it out.\" \"Have what out?\" \"My tooth, sir—it\u0027s been aching for some hours; did you ever have the toothache? If you did, you can feel for me, and not wonder that I lean my head upon my hands and groan.\" Todd looked about half satisfied at this excuse of Johanna\u0027s, and for a few moments as he looked at her, she thought that after all she should have to call upon her friends in the cupboard to save her from the danger that his eyes, in their flashing ghastliness, threatened. Another moment, and her lips would have parted with the shrill cry of \"Murder!\" upon them, and then Heaven only knows what might have been the result; but he turned suddenly, and went into the parlour, muttering to himself— \"It is not worth while now, and this night ends it all—yes, this night ends it all.\" He slammed the door violently behind him, and Johanna was relieved from the horror which his gaze had awakened, in her heart. She stood still, but gradually she recovered her former calmness—if calmness it could at all be called, seeing that it was only a stiller species of agitation. But she now began to recall the words of Sir Richard Blunt to the effect that measures had been taken that no more murders could be committed by Todd, and she began to feel comforted. \"There is something that I do not know yet,\" she said; \"Sir Richard should have told me how there could be no more murders done here, and then I should not have suffered what I did, and what I still suffer with the thought that almost before my eyes a fellow creature has been hurried into eternity; and yet I ought to have faith, and in defiance of all the seeming evidences of a horrible deed about me, I ought, I suppose, to believe that it has been prevented in some most strange and miraculous way.\" The more Johanna thought over this promise of Sir Richard Blunt\u0027s the more she became convinced that he would never have given utterance to it if he had not felt perfectly sure it would be fulfilled, and so she got comforted, and once again resolved to play her part in that dreadful drama of real life, in the vortex of which, with the purest and the holiest of motives, she had plunged recklessly, we will admit, but yet from motives entitling her to sympathy on earth, and protection in heaven. Todd remained for a considerable time in the parlour; and when he came out, Johanna saw that he had made some alteration in his apparel. The first words he uttered were— \"Keep a good fire, Charley.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Did you ever see a house on fire, my boy?\" \"I never did, sir.\" \"Ah! It must be an amusing sight—a very amusing sight, especially if the conflagration spreads, and one has an opportunity of viewing it from the water. Talking of water, the lady who was here this morning—Mrs. Lovett—was very fond of water, and now she has got plenty of it. Ah!\" \"Really, sir? Has she gone to the sea-side?\" Johanna looked Todd rather hard in the face as she spoke these words, and the close observation seemed to anger him, for he spoke hastily and sharply— \"What is it to you? Get out of my way, will you? and you may begin to think of shutting up, I think, for we shall have no more customers to-night. I am tired and weary. You are to sleep under the counter, you know.\" \"Yes, sir, you told me so. I daresay I shall be very comfortable there.\" \"And you have not been peeping and prying about, have you?\" \"Not at all.\" \"Not looking even into that cupboard, I suppose, eh? It\u0027s not locked, but that\u0027s no reason why you should look into it—not that there is any secrets in it; but I object to peeping and prying upon principle.\" Todd, as he spoke, advanced towards the cupboard, and Johanna thought that in another moment a discovery would undoubtedly take place of the two officers who were there concealed; and probably that would have been the case, had not the handle of the shop door been turned at that moment, and a man presented himself, when Todd turned quickly, and saw that he was a substantial-looking farmer, with dirty top-boots, as if he had just come off a journey. \"Well, master,\" said the visitor, \"I wants a clean shave.\" \"Oh,\" said Todd, not in the best of humours, \"it\u0027s rather late; but I suppose you would not like to wait till morning, for I don\u0027t know if I have any hot water.\" \"Oh, cold will do.\" \"Cold? Oh, dear no; we never shave in cold water; and if you must, you must; so sit down, sir, and we will soon settle the business.\" \"Thank you, thank you. I can\u0027t go to bed comfortable without a clean shave, do you see? I have come up from Braintree with beasts on commission, and I\u0027m staying at the Bull\u0027s Head, you see.\" \"Oh, indeed,\" said Todd, as he adjusted the shaving cloth, \"the Bull\u0027s Head.\" \"Yes, master; why I brought up a matter o\u0027 220 beasts, I did, do you see, and was on my pooney, as good a stepper as you\u0027d wish to see; and I sold \u0027em all, do you see, for 550 pun. Ho, ho! good work that, do you see, and only forty-two on \u0027em was my beasts, do you see; I\u0027ve got a missus at home, and a daughter; my girl\u0027s called Johanna—a-hem!\" Up to this point Johanna had not suspected that the game had begun, and that this was no other than Sir Richard himself, most admirably disguised, who had come to put an end to the mal-practices of Sweeney Todd; but his marked pronunciation of her name at once opened her eyes to that fact, and she knew that something interesting must soon happen. \"And so you sold them all?\" said Todd. \"Yes, master, I did, and I\u0027ve got the money in my pocket now, in bank-notes; I never leaves my money about at inns, do you see, master; safe bind, safe find, you see; I carries it about with me.\" \"A good plan, too,\" said Todd; \"Charley, some hot water; that\u0027s a good lad—and—and—Charley?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"While I am finishing off this gentleman, you may as well just run to the Temple to Mr. Serjeant Toldrunis and ask for his wig; we shall have to do it in the morning, and may as well have it the first thing in the day to begin upon; and you need not hurry, Charley, as we shall shut up when you come back.\" \"Very good, sir.\" Johanna walked out, but went no further than the shop window, close to which she placed her eyes, so that, between a pomatum jar and a lot of hair brushes, she could clearly see what was going on. \"A nice-looking little lad, that,\" said Todd\u0027s customer. \"Very, sir; an orphan boy; I took him out of charity, poor little fellow; but then, we ought to try to do all the good we can.\" \"Just so; I\u0027m glad I have come to be shaved here. Mine\u0027s rather a strong beard, I think, do you see.\" \"Why, sir, in a manner of speaking,\" replied Todd, \"it is a strong beard. I suppose you didn\u0027t come to London alone, sir?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276/89669.html","bookId":510,"book":{"id":510,"title":"The String of Pearls","description":"简介： The Romance of The String of Pearls having excited in the Literary world an almost unprecedented interest, it behoves the author to say a few words to his readers upon the completion of his labours....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
