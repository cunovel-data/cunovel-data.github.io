{"id":12068,"no":96,"title":"CHAPTER XCIII. SIR RICHARD BLUNT\u0027S SUBTERRANEAN EXPEDITION.","content":"While Todd is thus waiting anxiously for the arrival of his old ally in iniquity, but who now he considered to be his most deadly foe, and his worst possible hindrance to carry out his deeply—by far too deeply—laid schemes, we shall have time to take a peep at some proceedings of Sir Richard Blunt\u0027s, which are rather entertaining, and decidedly important. Johanna had not been long gone from the fruiterer\u0027s shop, before Sir Richard said to the fruiterer— \"If you are ready we will go now to the church at once. I have left quite a sufficient guard over the safety of Miss Oakley, and besides this affair will not take us I daresay above a couple of hours.\" \"Not so long I think,\" replied the fruiterer. \"I am quite ready, and no doubt your men are in the church by this time. They are apt to be punctual.\" \"They would not suit me for long if they were not,\" replied Sir Richard. \"Punctuality is the one grand principle which is the hinge of all my business, and the secret of by far the larger portion of my success.\" They walked rapidly up Fleet Street together, until they came opposite to St. Dunstan\u0027s Church, and then they crossed the road and tapped lightly at a little wicket in the great door of the building. The wicket was immediately opened by a man who touched his hat to Sir Richard. \"All right?\" asked the magistrate, \"and every one here?\" \"Yes, sir. Every one.\" \"That will do then. Be sure you fasten the door in the inside, so that that troublesome beadle, if he should be smitten with a desire to visit the church, cannot get in; and if he should come and be troublesome, take him into custody at once, and shut him him up anywhere that may keep him out of harm\u0027s way for the next twelve hours or so.\" \"Yes, sir.\" This man, whose business it evidently was to stay by the door, carefully fastened it, and Sir Richard Blunt with his friend from Fleet Street advanced into the body of the church. He had not gone far before a pew opened, and six persons came out. One of these was a well-dressed elderly man, who said, as the magistrate approached him— \"I have made all the necessary observations, Sir Richard, and am quite easy and confident that I can direct your men how to excavate directly to Todd\u0027s house.\" \"Thank you Sir Christopher,\" said the magistrate. \"I am very much indebted to you for the trouble you have taken in this affair, which I think is now near its climax.\" \"I hope so, Sir Richard. This way if you please.\" The whole party now proceeded to the same slab of stone which the magistrate had had before removed, for the purpose of making his inquiries below the surface of the earth. The slab was standing on its edge against a column of the nearest aisle, and the deep dark opening to the vaults was before them. \"There is but little foul air,\" said Sir Christopher. \"The stone has been off they tell me many hours. Shall I go first, or will you, Sir Richard?\" \"Allow me,\" said the magistrate; \"should there be any risks, it is my duty first to encounter them.\" \"As you please, Sir Richard. As you please, sir. I willingly give place to you, because I know, if there be any difficulty how much better calculated you are than any one here to overcome it.\" The magistrate made a slight bow to the compliment, and then taking a link in his hand, he descended the stairs leading to the vaults of St. Dunstan\u0027s. It will be well recollected that he had been in those vaults before, and that he had made certain discoveries, which to a vast extent implicated Mrs. Lovett in the crimes of Sweeney Todd; but his object upon this present visit was of a different character. In plain language, this was an attempt to ascertain if there were any underground modes of communication between Todd\u0027s house, and the vaults of old St. Dunstan\u0027s church. That there were some such subterraneous passages had become, after the most mature consideration, a firm conviction upon the mind of Sir Richard Blunt, and hence he had resolved upon such an exploration of the spot as should confirm or dispel the idea for ever. Those whom he had with him, were all persons upon whom he could thoroughly depend; and the ancient architect, who had given his services, was to point out the exact direction in which to proceed. Upon reaching the foot of the stone steps, instead of traversing the passage that led in the direction of Bell Yard, which he had formerly done, Sir Richard turned directly the other way, saying as he did so— \"This, I presume, will be our direction?\" \"We shall see in a moment,\" said the architect. \"I have taken the bearings so exactly, that I can point out to you the precise course.\" He forced into the ground to a sufficient depth to make it stand steady, his walking stick, and then removing a little gold cap from the top of it, he disclosed a small compass, which after some oscillations, steadied itself. \"Then,\" said Sir Christopher, \"through that wall would lead in a direct line to Todd\u0027s house.\" \"This will assist us,\" said Sir Richard. \"We will, before we actually begin excavating, endeavour to find some of the vaults which may run in that direction, and so perhaps save ourselves an immense amount of labour.\" \"Very good,\" said Sir Christopher Wren, \"I can at any time give you, from any place, the exact bearing of Todd\u0027s house, for I have it fixed in my mind, and can read it off from the compass plate in a moment.\" They now at once made their way into the vaults, and by dint of keeping to the right hand, they avoided going much out of their course. These vaults were of great extent, and although some of them, owing to being full of the dead, had been bricked up, yet they were very easily opened, and in many cases a direct thoroughfare for considerable distances was affected. Ever and anon the compass was appealed to, and showed them that they were approaching Todd\u0027s house. One of the party, a well-dressed gentlemanly-looking man, now stepped forward, and said to Sir Richard— \"Here, according to the plans of the church, the vaults end.\" \"Then we can get no further?\" \"Not an inch, Sir Richard.\" \"Then here commences in reality our mission, which is to try to discover some communication between the lower part of the house occupied by Sweeney Todd, and these vaults. Let us each use our utmost discrimination to affect that object.\" He lighted for himself a small lantern, and commenced a rigorous search of the walls, but for some few minutes could find nothing to excite the least suspicion. At length he paused at one portion of one of the vaults, where a kind of wooden tomb had been erected close to the wall. A large piece of dirty oak was placed upright against the earth work. \"If there be any mode of leaving this vault, but the one we have entered,\" he said, \"it is here.\" At these words, so significant as they were of some discovery having been made by Sir Richard, all those who were with him made their way to that spot, and from their several lanterns, a glare of light was thrown upon the wooden monument. \"This,\" said the person who had before spoken of the plan of the vaults, \"this is the monument of a Sir Giles Horseman, who was killed by accident and interred here about twenty-two years ago. It was a very unusual thing to make any such erection in a vault, but his widow wished it, and the authorities saw no good reason for interfering.\" The monument had evidently consisted of an oaken kind of square ornamental tomb affixed to the wall, and extending out about six feet into the vault. That portion of it which did so extend into the vault had fallen in, but the piece of oak which had been originally affixed to the wall there remained. \"What leads you to suppose, Sir Richard,\" said the architect, \"that this place will show us anything?\" \"This,\" said the magistrate, as he picked up from amid the rubbish of the broken monument, a nearly new glove of thick leather. \"How did this get here?\" The glove was passed from hand to hand, and duly examined. No one owned it, and the only remark that could be made upon it was, that it was of an immense size. \"Then,\" said Sir Richard Blunt, \"since it belongs to none of us, I give it as my opinion that it belongs to Sweeney Todd, and has fallen from his hand in this place.\" \"It must be so,\" said the fruiterer. \"I know of no hand in the City of London that such a glove would fit but his.\" \"But how came he here?\" said Sir Christopher. \"That is the question. How could he get here.\" \"We shall see,\" said the magistrate. \"Lend me that small iron crow-bar, Jenkins.\" The crow-bar was handed to Sir Richard Blunt, and at one touch with it down come the piece of oak that was against the wall. That was conclusive, for, instead of the solid wall beyond it, there was a deep crevice or opening just sufficient to enable one person to go through it. \"This is the place,\" said the magistrate. There was a death-like silence among all present. Every ear was on the stretch, and every eye was fixed upon the narrow opening in the wall of the vault. It would almost seem as though every one expected Sweeney Todd to appear with one of his victims on his back that he had just, to use his own expressive phraseology, succeeded in polishing off. Sir Christopher stuck up his compass again, and it was his voice that first broke the stillness. \"The route is direct,\" he said. \"To Todd\u0027s house?\" asked Sir Richard. \"Yes, direct.\" \"Then all we have got to do is to follow it. It is an enterprise perhaps attended with some danger, and certainly with much horror, I think. Now, I do not ask any one to follow me, but go I will.\" \"I will follow you, Sir Richard,\" said the fruiterer. \"I reside in Fleet Street, and rather than not ferret out such a villain as Todd from the neighbourhood, I would run any risks. I am with you, sir.\" \"And I,\" said Sir Christopher Wren. \"And I—and I,\" cried every one. \"Come on,\" said the magistrate. \"Come on. I will take the small lantern, and if I meet Todd, my great aim will be to take him a prisoner, not to kill him; and mind all of you, if by any chance a scuffle with that man should ensue, it would be a scandalous cheating of the gallows to do him any injury that might even delay his execution. Now, come on.\" It required no small amount of real courage to lead the way in that expedition into the very bowels of the earth as it were; but with the small lantern elevated as far above his head as the roof of the passage would admit of, Sir Richard stepped cautiously and slowly on. The excavation in which they were was roughly but well made. At intervals of about twelve feet each, there always occurred two upright pieces of plank supporting a third piece on the roof, and firmly wedged in, so that there was but little likelihood of a fall of earth from above. Suddenly a scuffling noise was heard, and Sir Richard for a moment paused. \"What is it?\" said the fruiterer. \"Only some rats,\" he replied. \"I daresay there are plenty of such gentlemen in this quarter of the world, and probably they never saw so large a party here before. They are scudding along in a regiment here.\" After going on for about twenty paces further, Sir Richard found a door completely blocking up the passage. By dint of careful investigation of it, he found it was locked, and the key in the other side of the lock. He pushed it through with some difficulty, and then, with a skeleton key, opened the door in the course of a few moments. \"Come on,\" he said. \"Ah! this is a different place.\" They now found themselves in some regularly constructed vaults, arched with stone, down the sides of which there rolled long streams of moisture. They were all quite at a loss to know what place they had got into, for they knew of nothing of the sort beneath Fleet Street, and they gazed about them with wonder. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276/89653.html","bookId":510,"book":{"id":510,"title":"The String of Pearls","description":"简介： The Romance of The String of Pearls having excited in the Literary world an almost unprecedented interest, it behoves the author to say a few words to his readers upon the completion of his labours....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
