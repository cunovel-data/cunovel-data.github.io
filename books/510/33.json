{"id":12005,"no":33,"title":"CHAPTER XXXI. SHOWS HOW TOBIAS GOT TO LONDON.","content":"We will now take a peep at Tobias. On—on—on, like the wind, went the poor belated boy from the vicinity of that frightful prison-house at Peckham. Terror was behind him—terror with dishevelled locks was upon his right hand, and terror shrieking in his ear was upon his left. On—on, he flew like a whirlwind. Alas, poor Tobias, will your young intellects yet stand these trials? We shall see! Through the deep mud of the Surrey roads—past pedestrians—past horsemen, and past coaches flew poor Tobias, on—on. He had but one thought, and that was to place miles and miles of space between him and Mr. Fogg\u0027s establishment. The perspiration poured down his face—his knees shook under him—his heart beat as though in some wild pulsation it would burst, but he passed on until he saw afar off the old Bridge of London. The route to Blackfriars he had by some chance avoided. Many, who for the last two miles of Tobias\u0027s progress, had seen him, had tried to stop him. They had called after him, but he had heeded them not. Some fast runners had pursued him for a short distance, and then given up the chase in despair. He reached the bridge. \"Stop that boy!\" cried a man, \"he looks mad!\" \"No—no,\" shrieked Tobias, \"I am not mad! I am not mad!\" A man held out his arms to stop him, but Tobias dashed past him like a flash of lightning, and was off again. \"Stop him!\" cried twenty voices. \"Stop thief!\" shouted some who could not conceive that anybody was to be stopped on any other account. \"No, no,\" gasped Tobias, as he flew onwards—\"not mad, not mad!\" The Flight Of Tobias From Peckham Mad-House. The Flight Of Tobias From Peckham Mad-House. His feet failed him. He reeled a few more paces like a drunken man, and then fell heavily upon some stone steps, where he lay bathed in perspiration. Blood too gushed from his mouth. A gentleman\u0027s horse was standing at the door, and the man came out to mount him at that moment, and he saw the rapidly collecting crowd. With the reins of his steed in his hand, he pushed his way through the mob, saying— \"What is it? what is it?\" \"A mad boy, sir,\" said some. \"Only look at him. Did you ever see the like. He looks as if he had run a hundred miles.\" \"Good God!\" cried the gentleman. \"It is he! It is he!\" \"Who, sir? who, sir?\" \"A poor lad that I know, I will take charge of him. My name is Jeffery, I am Colonel Jeffery. A couple of guineas to any strong man who will carry him to the nearest surgeon\u0027s. Alas! poor boy, what a state is this to meet him in.\" It was quite astonishing the numbers of strong men that there were all of a sudden in the crowd, who were each anxious and willing to earn the colonel\u0027s two guineas. There was danger of a fight arising upon the subject, when one man, after knocking down two others and threatening the remainder, stepped up, and lifting Tobias as though he had been an infant, exclaimed— \"Ale does it! ale does it! Come on, my little \u0027un.\" All gave way before the gigantic proportions of no other than our old friend Big Ben the Beef Eater, who, as chance would have it, was upon the spot, and who, without a thought of the colonel\u0027s two guineas, only heard that a poor sick boy had to be carried to the nearest medical man. Tobias could not be in better hands than Ben\u0027s, for the latter carried him much more carefully than ever nursemaid carried a child out of sight of its mother. \"Follow me,\" said Colonel Jeffery, as he saw in the distance a party-coloured lamp, which hung over a door appertaining to a chemist. \"Follow, and I will reward you.\" \"Doesn\u0027t want it,\" said Ben. \"It\u0027s ale as does it.\" \"What?\" \"Ale does it. Here you is. Come on.\" Colonel Jeffery was rather surprised at the droll customer he had picked up in the street, but provided he carried Tobias in safety, which by-the-bye he (the colonel) would not have scrupled to do himself, had he not been encumbered by his horse, it was all one to him, and that he saw Ben was effectually doing. Tobias had shown some slight symptoms of vitality before being lifted from the step of the door close to which he had fallen, but by the time they all reached the chemist\u0027s shop, he was in a complete state of insensibility. Of course the usual crowd that collects on such occasions followed them, and during the walk the colonel had time to think, and the result of those thoughts was, that it would be a most desirable thing to keep the knowledge to himself that Tobias was Tobias. He had, in order to awe the mob from any interference with him, announced who he was, but had not announced Tobias. At least if he had uttered his name, he felt certain that it was in an interjectional sort of way, and not calculated to awaken any suspicion. \"I will keep it to myself,\" he thought, \"that Tobias is in my possession, otherwise if such a fact should travel round to Sweeney Todd, there\u0027s no saying to what extent it might put that scoundrel upon his guard.\" By the time the colonel had arrived at this conclusion the whole party had reached the chemist\u0027s, and Big Ben walked in with Tobias, and placed him at once upon the top of a plate-glass counter, which had upon it a large collection of trumpery scent bottles and wonderful specifics for everything, through which Tobias went with a crash. \"There he is!\" said Ben—\"ale does it.\" \"Fire! murder! my glass case!\" cried the chemist, \"Oh, you monster!\" \"Ale does it. What do you mean, eh?\" Big Ben backed a pace or two and went head and shoulders through a glass case of similar varieties that was against the wall. \"Gracious bless the beasteses,\" said Ben, \"is your house made of glass? What do you mean by it, eh? A fellow can\u0027t turn round here without going through something. You ought to be persecuted according to law, that you ought.\" Now this learned chemist had in the glass case against which Big Ben had tumbled a skeleton, which, from the stunning and terrible look it had in his shop, brought him many customers, and it was against this remnant of humanity that Big Ben\u0027s head met, after going through the glass as a preparatory step. By some means or another Ben caught his head under the skeleton\u0027s ribs, and the consequence was that out he hooked him from the glass case, and the first intimation Ben had of anything unusual, consisted of seeing a pair of bony legs dangling down on each side of him. So unexpected a phenomenon gave Ben what he called a \"blessed turn,\" and out he bounced from the shop, carrying the skeleton for all the world like what is called pick-a-back, for the wires that supplied the place of cartilages held it erect, and so awful a sight surely was never seen in the streets of London as Big Ben with a skeleton upon his back. People fled before—some turned in at shop doors; and an old lady with a large umbrella and a pair of gigantic pattens went clean through a silversmith\u0027s window. But we must leave Ben and the skeleton to get on as well as they can en route to the Tower, while we turn our attention to Tobias. \"Are you a surgeon?\" cried Colonel Jeffery. \"A—a surgeon? No, I\u0027m only a druggist; but is that any reason why a second Goliath should come into my shop and destroy everything?\" Colonel Jeffery did not wait for anything more, but snatching Tobias from the remnants of the plate glass, he ran to the door with him, and handing him to the first person he saw there, he cried— \"When I am mounted give me the boy.\" \"Yes, sir.\" He sprang upon his horse; Tobias was handed to him like a bale of goods, and laying him comfortably as he could upon the saddle before him, off set the colonel at a good round trot through Finsbury to his own house. Colonel Jeffery had no sort of intention that the chemist should be a sufferer, but in his hurry to be off with Tobias, and speedily get medical advice for him, he forgot to say so, and accordingly there stood the man of physic then fairly bewildered by the events of the last few moments, during which his stock in trade had been materially damaged and a valuable amount of glass broken, to say nothing of the singular and most unexpected abduction of his friend the skeleton. \"Here\u0027s a pretty day\u0027s work!\" he said. \"Here\u0027s a pretty day\u0027s work! More mischief done than enough, and the worst of it is, my wife will hear of it, and then there will be a deal of peace in the house. Oh, dear—oh, dear—was there ever such an unfort—I knew it—\" A good rap upon his head from a pair of bellows wielded by a little meagre-faced woman, that he was big enough to have swallowed, confined his words. While all this was going on, Colonel Jeffery had ridden fast, and passing through Finsbury and up the City-road, had reached his house in the fashionable—but now quite the reverse, as the man says in the play—district of Pentonville. \"This is a prize,\" thought the colonel, \"worth the taking. It will go hard with me but I will extract from this boy all that he knows of Sweeney Todd, and we shall see how far that knowledge will go towards the confirmation of my suspicions regarding him.\" He carried Tobias himself to a comfortable bed-room, and immediately sent for a medical practitioner of good repute in the neighbourhood, who happening fortunately to be at home, obeyed the summons immediately. He sent likewise for his friend the captain, whom he knew would be overjoyed to hear of what he would call the capture of Tobias Ragg. The medical man made his appearance first, as being much closer at hand, and the colonel led him to the apartment of the invalid boy, saying to him as he went— \"I know nothing of what is the matter with this lad—I have been very anxious to see him on account of certain information that he possesses, and only found him this morning upon a door step in the street, in the state you see him.\" \"Is he very ill?\" \"I am afraid he is.\" The medical man followed the colonel to the room in which poor Tobias lay, and after gazing upon him for a few moments, and opening with his fingers the closed eyelids of Tobias, he shook his head. \"I wish I knew,\" he said, \"what has produced this state. Can you not inform me, sir?\" \"Indeed I cannot, but I suspect that the boy\u0027s imagination has been cruelly acted upon by a man, whom you will excuse me from naming just at present, but whom I sincerely hope to bring to justice shortly.\" \"The boy\u0027s brain, no doubt, is in a bad condition. I do not take upon myself to say that, as an organ, it is diseased, but fractionally it is damaged. However, we must do the best we can to recover him from this condition of collapse in which he is.\" \"Can you form any opinion as to his probable recovery?\" \"Indeed I cannot, but he is young, and youth is a great thing. The best that can be done shall be done.\" \"I thank you. Spare nothing for the lad, and pay him every attention, as though he were a son or a brother of my own; I long to hear him speak, and to convince him that he is really among friends, who are not only willing to protect him, but have likewise the power to do so.\" The medical man bowed, as he said— \"May I ask his name, sir?\" He had his tablets in his hand ready to book the name of Tobias, but the colonel was so very much afraid that Sweeney Todd might by some means learn that Tobias was in his house, and so take an alarm, that he would not trust even the medical man, who, no doubt, had no other motive in asking the name than merely to place it in his list of calls. \"Smith,\" said the colonel. The medical man gave a short dry sort of cough, as he wrote \"Master Smith\" upon his tablets, and then promising to return in half an hour, he took his leave. At the expiration of half an hour Tobias was put under a course of treatment. His head was shaved, and a blister clapped upon the back of his neck. The room was darkened, and strict quiet was enjoined. \"As soon as he betrays any signs of consciousness, pray send for me, sir,\" said the surgeon. \"Certainly.\" In the course of the day the captain made his appearance, and Colonel Jeffery detailed to him all that had taken place, only lamenting that, after so happily getting possession of Tobias, he should be in so sorry a condition. The captain expressed a wish to see him, and they both went to the chamber, where a woman had been hired to sit with Tobias, in order to give the first intimation of his stirring. Of course, as it was her duty, and what she was specially hired for, to keep wide awake, she was fast asleep, and snoring loud enough to awaken any one much worse than poor Tobias. But that was to to be expected. \"Oh,\" said the captain, \"this is a professional nurse.\" \"A professional devil!\" said the colonel. \"How did you know that?\" \"By her dropping off so comfortably to sleep, and her utter neglect of her charge. I never knew one that did not do so, and, in good truth, I am inclined to think it is the very best thing they can do, for if they are not asleep they are obnoxiously awake.\" The colonel took a pin from his cravat, and rather roughly inserted its point into the fat arm of the nurse. She started up, exclaiming— \"Drat the fleas, can\u0027t a mortal sleep in peace for them?\" \"Madam,\" said the colonel, \"how much is owing to you for sleeping here a few hours?\" \"Lord bless me, sir, is this you? The poor soul has never so much as stirred. How my heart bleeds continually for him, to be sure. Ah, dear me, we are all born like sparks, and keep continually flying upward, as the psalm says.\" \"How much do I owe you?\" \"Here to-day, and gone to-morrow. Bless his innocent face.\" The colonel rung the bell, and a strapping footman made his appearance. \"You will see this woman to the door, John,\" he said, \"and pay her for being here about three hours.\" \"Why, you mangy skin-flint,\" cried the woman. \"What do you—\" She was cut short in her vituperative eloquence by John, who handed her down stairs with such dispatch that a pint bottle of gin rolled out of her pocket and was smashed, filling the house with an odour that was quite unmistakeable. \"What do you propose to do?\" said the captain. \"Why, as we have dined, if you have no objection we will sit here and keep this poor benighted one company for awhile. He is better with no one than such as she whom I have dislodged; but before night he shall have a more tender and less professional nurse. You know more of the world, after all, than I do, captain.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276/89590.html","bookId":510,"book":{"id":510,"title":"The String of Pearls","description":"简介： The Romance of The String of Pearls having excited in the Literary world an almost unprecedented interest, it behoves the author to say a few words to his readers upon the completion of his labours....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
