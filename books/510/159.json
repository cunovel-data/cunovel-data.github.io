{"id":12131,"no":159,"title":"CHAPTER CLVI. SIR RICHARD BLUNT IS VERY NEAR TAKING HIS PRISONER.","content":"We left the poor beadle in anything but a pleasant situation in the pulpit of St. Dunstan\u0027s Church. Now it so happened that the beadle was particularly wanted at home; and as he did not make his appearance, his wife repaired to the church to search for him; but it was locked by Todd, who had swung the door shut after him, and as he had taken the key with him, she could not make her way into the sacred edifice. As she stood at the door, however, she distinctly heard deep groans issuing from some one within the church; and in a state of great alarm, she ran off to one of the churchwardens, who had a duplicate key, and related what she had heard. The churchwarden not being one of the most valorous of men, rather, upon the whole, declined to go into the church with no other escort than the beadle\u0027s wife; and as he, too, upon listening at the key-hole, heard the groans distinctly, he called upon the passers-by to assist, and got together quickly enough about twenty people to go into the church with him. \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"I don\u0027t know what it is, but there\u0027s groans; and in these horrid times, when, for all we know, Sweeney Todd is about the neighbourhood, one can\u0027t be too cautious.\" \"Certainly,\" said everybody. \"Then, gentlemen, if we all go in together when I open the door, it will be the very best plan.\" This was duly agreed to; and the churchwarden, with a trembling hand, turned his key in the lock, and opened the door. He then stepped aside, and let all the crowd go in first, thinking that, as he was a man in office, the parish could not afford to lose him, in case anything serious should happen. \"Well, gentlemen,\" he cried, \"what is it?\" \"Nothing,\" said everybody. \"Then I will soon let nothing see that I, a churchwarden, am not to be frightened with impunity—that is to say, when I say frightened, I don\u0027t exactly mean that, but astonished, I mean. Come, come—if any one be here, I call upon them to surrender in the king\u0027s name!\" A deep groan was the only response to this valorous speech; and the moment the churchwarden heard it, he bolted out of the church, and ran right across the way into a shop opposite. For a moment or two, this precipitate retreat of the churchwarden had something contagious in it, and the whole of the men who had been induced to stop and go into the church with him were inclined to retreat likewise; but curiosity detained some three of four of them, and that gave courage to the others. \"What was it?\" said one. \"A groan,\" said another; \"and it came from the pulpit.\" \"The pulpit!\" cried everybody. \"Who ever heard of a pulpit groaning?\" cried a third. \"You stupid!\" cried the second speaker: \"might it not be some one in the pulpit?—and—Oh Lord—there\u0027s a head!\" At this they all took to flight; but at the door they encountered a man, who called out— \"What\u0027s the matter? Can\u0027t you tell a fellow what the blessed row is—eh?\" This was no other than our old friend Crotchet, who was returning from a conference with Sir Richard Blunt at his private office in Craven Street. \"Oh, it\u0027s a ghost! A ghost!\" \"A what?\" \"A ghost in the pulpit, and there is his head.\" \"You don\u0027t say so?\" said Crotchet, as he peered into the church, and shading his eyes with his hand, saw the beadle\u0027s head just peeping over the side of the pulpit in a most mysterious kind of way. \"I\u0027ll soon have him out, ghost or no ghost.\" Courage is as contagious as fear, especially when somebody else volunteers to run all the risk; and so when Crotchet said he would soon have the somebody out of the pulpit, the whole crowd followed him into the church, applauding him very greatly for his prowess, and declaring that if he had not then arrived, they would soon have had the ghost or no ghost out of the sacred building, that they would. But they kept within a few paces of the door for all that, so that they might be ready for a rush into Fleet Street, if Mr. Crotchet should be overcome in the adventure. That was only prudent. But Crotchet was not exactly the man to be overcome in any adventure, and with an utter oblivion of all fear, he marched right into the middle of the church, and commenced the ascent of the pulpit stairs. \"Come—come,\" said Crotchet. \"This won\u0027t do, Mr. Ghost, if you please; just let me get hold of you, that\u0027s all.\" \"Oh!\" groaned the beadle. \"Oh, yer is remarkably bad, is yer? but that sort of thing won\u0027t answer, by no means. Where is yer?\" Crotchet opened the pulpit door, and reaching in his hand, he caught hold of the beadle by the leg, and fairly dragged him out on to the little spiral stairs, down which he let him roll with a great many bumps, until he landed in the body of the church all over bruises. \"Why, goodness gracious!\" cried the beadle\u0027s wife, \"it\u0027s my wretch of a husband after all!\" The beadle had just strength to assume a sitting posture, and then he cried—\"Murder!—murder!—murder!\" until Mr. Crotchet, seizing a cushion from a pew, held it up before his mouth, to the imminent danger of choking him, and said— \"Hold your row! If you wants to be murdered, can\u0027t you get it done quietly, without alarming of all the parish? If you has got anything to say, say it; and if you has got nothink, keep it to yourself, stupid.\" \"Todd!\" gasped the beadle, the moment the pew-cushion was withdrawn from his mouth. \"Todd—Sweeney Todd!\" \"What?\" cried Crotchet. \"Here!—he has been here, and I\u0027m a dead man—no, I\u0027m a beadle. Oh, murder! murder!\" \"Don\u0027t begin that again. Be quiet, will you? If you have got anything to say about Todd, say it, for I\u0027m the very man of all the world as wants to hear it. Speak up, and don\u0027t wink.\" \"Oh, I\u0027ve seen him. He\u0027s been here. I came to dust the bellowses, you see, after my wife had thrown the pulpit at my head, for asking her to come with me.\" \"Oh, he\u0027s a-raving gentlemen,\" said the wife. \"As I\u0027m a sinner, it was the bellowses as I throwed at his stupid head, and not the pulpit as never was.\" \"Go on,\" said Crotchet. \"Confound the pulpit and the bellows too. It\u0027s about Todd I want to hear. Drive on, will you?\" \"Oh, yes. I\u0027m a coming to that; but it curdles my blood, and makes my wig stand on end. I had dusted the communion table, and banged the cushions, and up I goes to the pulpit, meaning to do for that as soon as I could, when who should be there but Sweeney Todd!\" \"In the pulpit!\" cried everybody. \"In the pulpit,\" said the beadle. \"Why didn\u0027t you nab him at once?\" roared Crotchet. \"Because, my good friend, he nabbed me at once. He laid hold of me by this leg—no, it was this—no it wasn\u0027t. It was this—that is—no—\" \"Confound both your legs! Where is he now?\" \"Why, really I can\u0027t exactly say, for after stamping upon my inside for about half an hour, he left me for dead, and I was about half gone that way, and I have been a groaning ever since, till now. I am going fast—very fast, and there will be an election for beadle again in this here parish. Oh dear—oh dear! Murder—murder—mur—\" \"What, you is coming that agin, is you,\" cried Crotchet, as he again caught up the pew-cushion. \"I shall be obligated, after all, for to push this down your blessed throat. Hold your noise, will you, Mr. What\u0027s-your-name.\" The beadle was so terrified at the idea of the pew-cushion again nearly smothering him, that despite all his injuries, he sprang to his feet and bolted out of the church. \"Well, did yer ever know sich a feller?\" said Crotchet. \"Why, one would think he was afraid of Todd.\" The spectators thought that nothing was more probable; and as Mr. Crotchet considered that he had got all the information he was at all likely to get from the beadle, he did not at all trouble himself to go after him, but after considering for a few moments, decided upon seeking Sir Richard Blunt, and telling him that he had heard some unexpected news of Todd. Crotchet knew where to pitch upon Sir Richard at once; and when he related to him what had taken place, a look of great chagrin came over the face of the magistrate. \"Crotchet,\" he said, \"I have missed Todd, then, by what may be considered a hair\u0027s breadth. He must have been in the pulpit while I was in the church alone. Oh, that I could but for a moment have guessed as much! You, if you recollect, Crotchet, were in the vaults, and I was waiting for you.\" \"To be sure, Sir Richard.\" \"And so the rascal was almost within arm\u0027s length, and yet escaped me.\" Sir Richard Blunt paced to and fro in an agony of impatience and regret. To be so near apprehending Todd, and yet to miss him, was truly terrific. \"Lor, sir,\" said Crotchet, \"what\u0027s the use of fretting and pining about it? That won\u0027t bring it back, sir, I can tell you. After all, sir, you can\u0027t do better than grin and bear it, you know, which is the out and outest policy on all these here occasions, you know, yer worship. I wish as I\u0027d a knowed he\u0027d been in the church as much as you do; but you don\u0027t see me a cussin and a knocking my own head about it, no how.\" \"You are right, Crotchet, but in good truth it is most desperately provoking. You will proceed as I have directed you, and I will run down to Norfolk Street river, for fear Todd should try to escape us that way. You will be so good, Crotchet, as to be as vigilant as possible. You know how to find me if you want me.\" \"Rather, sir.\" At this moment, and just as Crotchet was upon the point of leaving the room, an officer brought in a little slip of paper to Sir Richard Blunt, upon which was the word \"Ben.\" \"Ben—Ben?\" said Sir Richard, \"who is Ben? Oh, I think I know. Pray show him in at once. It is my friend the beef-eater, from the Tower.\" \"Easy does it,\" said Ben, popping his head in at the door of the room. \"Easy does it.\" \"So it does, Ben. Come in. I am glad to see you. You can go, Crotchet. Pray be seated, Ben, and tell me how I can serve you in any way, my good friend, and you may be assured that I shall have exceeding pleasure in doing so, if I possibly can in any way.\" \"Lord bless you,\" said Ben, \"I hardly knows. There\u0027s ups and downs in this here world, and ins and outs.\" \"Not a doubt of it, Ben.\" \"And retreats within retreats, Sir Richard, and foxes, and laughing hyenas, as you can\u0027t concilliorate no how, if you wollop \u0027em till you can\u0027t wollop \u0027em no more.\" \"Precisely, Ben. If I were a hyena, I don\u0027t exactly think, do you know, that such a process would conciliate me.\" \"Oh, dear yes—it\u0027s the only way. But what I\u0027ve come about, Sir Richard, is what I calls a delicate affair. Oh, dear yes—I tries to take it easy but I can\u0027t—I\u0027m—I\u0027m—\" \"What, Ben?\" \"I\u0027m in love! Oh!\" \"Well, Ben, there is no great wonder in that. I have been in love myself, and I believe very few indeed escape the soft impeachment. I hope your love is prosperous, Ben?\" \"Thank you kindly, Sir Richard, thank you; but, you see, I thought you might tell me if there was any vice or natural kicking running in the family, and that\u0027s why I comed here.\" \"I tell you, Ben? Why I don\u0027t even know the name of the family.\" \"Yes, you does, Sir Richard. The young woman as I fell in love with, is Miss Julia Hardman, and her father is one of those chaps as nabs the bad un\u0027s for you, you know, Sir Richard.\" \"One of my officers?\" \"To be sure he is.\" \"Does he reside in Norfolk Street, Strand?\" \"Does he? Ay, he does; and that\u0027s how I came to know the little morsel of a cretur as has made for the first time an impression upon my heart. Oh, Ben, Ben, little could anybody think as you was a marrying sort of person, and here you is in love with Miss Julia!\" \"It does seem to me a little extraordinary, Ben, for I must confess I have heard you say some rather severe things against the married state.\" \"I have—I have; and if it hadn\u0027t a been for all the marrying set-out with those two girls, Johanna and Arabella, I never should have got sich a idea in my head. Howsomedever, there it is, and there it is likely to remain. It\u0027s a agravation, but there it is!\" \"And how did you get acquainted with Julia Hardman?\" \"Oh, dear! There\u0027s a public house at the corner of her street, and after I had been to Cousin Oakley\u0027s, I used to go there at times and get a drain of something, you see, and then she used to come tripping in with a mug for the family beer, you see; and once it rained, so I took her up and carried her home beer and all, and that was how we got acquainted, you see, Sir Richard.\" \"A very natural way too, Ben. All I can say is, that I know her father to be a very worthy man indeed, and I believe the daughter is a good and virtuous girl.\" \"You don\u0027t say so? Then as there\u0027s no vice and kicking, I do believe I shall have to marry her out of hand.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276/89716.html","bookId":510,"book":{"id":510,"title":"The String of Pearls","description":"简介： The Romance of The String of Pearls having excited in the Literary world an almost unprecedented interest, it behoves the author to say a few words to his readers upon the completion of his labours....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
