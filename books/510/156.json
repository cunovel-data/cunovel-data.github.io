DUNSTAN\u0027S.","content":"\"Oh!\" groaned Todd to himself. \"Oh, if I had but shot the villain before the other one came up from the vaults, and all would have been well; but I cannot shoot them both at once. It is not often that I lose anything by procrastination, but I have now—Oh, yes, I have now! It is maddening!—It is quite maddening! and I could find in my own heart almost to turn this pistol against my own life, only that I hope yet to live a little while for vengeance.\" A smart tap came against the church door. \"Open the door, Crotchet,\" said Sir Richard. \"We are alone in the church now, for the beadle was too careful of himself to remain after he found that there was some little danger.\" \"Oh, sir,\" said Crotchet, with an expression of disgust in his face, \"beadles is humbugs, sir; and this beadle of St. Dunstan\u0027s is the very worst of the worst of beadles. Didn\u0027t you notice, sir, what an old humbug he was before, when we was a-coming here on the hunt about Todd and that beautiful creature Mrs. Lovett? Then, sir, we found out what sort of a beadle that was. I rather think I despises beadles, sir; I does, your worship.\" Tap came the knock at the church door again. \"You forget, Crotchet,\" said Sir Richard, pointing to the door. \"Lor, yer worship, so I did. I begs his blessed pardon whosomever it is. Come in. There\u0027s nobody but the right sort here, whoever it is. Hilloa! it\u0027s our friend, Green.\" \"Ah, Green, are you looking for me?\" said Sir Richard. \"I was, sir.\" \"Then you have news. What is it?\" \"Todd is in the neighbourhood, sir, or was an hour or two ago, I am well assured.\" \"Todd?\" \"Yes, sir. He was in his own house. A man came to the door of it to see the person minding it, and the door was opened a little way, and Todd tried to pull him in, and would have pulled him in, but his neckcloth gave way, and then the fire broke out directly after. The man has been in too great a fright till just a little while ago to venture into the street again.\" \"You have seen him?\" \"I have, sir.\" \"Bring him here, Green.\" Green immediately left the church, and Mr. Crotchet set up a long and melancholy whistle. \"In my heart I thought this might be,\" said Sir Richard, \"and yet having no evidence to justify the suggestion of my fancy, I did not like to nurse the idea. Todd in this neighbourhood—Todd in his own house! Oh, what a chance!\" \"Your worship,\" said Crotchet, shaking his head and speaking slowly, with an appearance of great wisdom. \"Your worship, it\u0027s mostly always the case. There\u0027s a special providence that always brings back folks as has done a murder back again to the place where they has done it; and the next time I\u0027m on the lay for a cove as has done a slaughtering job, I shall sit myself down, yer worship, in the room where he did it and wait for him. It\u0027s a special thing of Providence, it is, sir, I feel as sure as though I did it myself, as isn\u0027t Providence at all, but just Crotchet, and no sort of mistake.\" \"You are right, Crotchet, as far as examples go. We will only just listen to what this man that Green has gone for has got to say, and then we will be off and do our best.\" \"Yes, yer worship, we will; and here he is.\" Green, the officer, now brought into the church the very man with whom Todd had had the little adventure at the door of his shop; and notwithstanding the time that had elapsed since that little incident, the man was still in a state of terror, which was quite manifest in every feature of his face. \"Why, what\u0027s the matter with you?\" said Crotchet, as he dealt the man a blow on the back that nearly took all his breath away. \"You look as scared as if you had just seen a ghost, old fellow, that you do.\" \"It was worse than a ghost.\" Sir Richard Blunt stepped up to the man, and said— \"Do you know me? I am Sir Richard Blunt the magistrate.\" \"Oh, yes, sir, I know you.\" \"Answer me then, clearly and distinctly, for much may depend upon it. Who was it opened the door of Todd\u0027s house for you, and strove, as I hear, to drag you into it?\" \"Sweeney Todd, sir.\" \"Are you quite sure? Do you know him well by sight?\" \"Oh, yes, sir, I could swear it.\" \"And you thought it very natural that he should be there, and if anybody there had so laid hold of you in the dark, you would, of course, at once have naturally concluded that it must be Todd?\" \"Oh, dear no, sir, I hadn\u0027t an idea that it could be him, sir; and if I hadn\u0027t seen his face, that I know quite well, I couldn\u0027t possibly have believed it to be him.\" \"That is enough. I will not trouble you any further. I am much obliged to you for your information.\" \"You are very welcome, Sir Richard; and I do hope you may catch the rascal soon. I shall never forget his having hold of me, for the longest day I have to live.\" Still shaking at the bare remembrance of the danger that he had run, the man left the church; and peeping over his shoulder every now and then as he went, for fear Todd should be close at hand, he took his route to quite a different quarter of the town, where he fancied he should feel more secure; for he could not make up his mind to anything but that Todd must have some special desire to lay hold of him, and add him to the already formidable muster-roll of his victims. When he left the church, Sir Richard Blunt turned to Crotchet, and said— \"Crotchet, you may depend, now, that Todd is in London, and fancies that among its crowds will be his greatest chance of safety. I will take measures at once to discover him. Come along with me to Craven-street, and you too, Green, and I will explain to you both what I think will be the best plan to adopt.\" \"All\u0027s right, sir; we\u0027ll have him,\" said Crotchet. \"I think we shall,\" said Green, \"for, large as London is, I rather think we know how to search it as well as most folks. I attend you, sir, and I will run any risk in the world to take the scoundrel prisoner.\" \"And so will I,\" said Crotchet. \"I know you both well,\" said Sir Richard, \"and I cannot desire to be aided by better men than you both are. Come on. I will not speak further of any plans or projects except in my own office, where I know that there are no spies or eaves-droppers.\" \"This blessed church is pretty safe,\" said Crotchet. \"It ain\u0027t very likely that anybody is on the listening lay in it. It would be rather cold work, I take it. But, howsomdever, there\u0027s nothing like being on the right side of the hedge, and in one\u0027s own crib, that one knows all the ins and all the outs of, after all.\" They both followed Sir Richard Blunt from the church, and Todd felt that he was once again alone within that sacred edifice, the very atmosphere of which was profaned by the presence of such a wretch, so loaded with crimes as he was. \"Gone,\" said Todd, looking up put of the pulpit, \"and may all—\" We cannot repeat the maledictions of Todd. They were additionally awful spoken in such a building, and from such a place in that building. It was dreadful that the roof of a place reared to the worship of God, should be desecrated by the raving curses of such a man as Todd. He was silent after he had satisfied his first ebullition of rage, and then he was afraid that he had gone too far, and endangered his safety by making an appearance at all above the level of the pulpit, or by speaking. How did he know but that Sir Richard Blunt might, after all, have some sort of suspicion that he was not far off, and be listening close at hand? As this supposition, wild and vague as it was, and quite unsupported by any evidence, found a home in the brain of Todd, the perspiration of intense fear broke out upon his brow, and again he shook to the extent of making the old pulpit creak dreadfully. \"Oh, hush! hush!\" he moaned. \"Be still—be still. I am safe yet. There is no one here. I am safe, surely. There is no one in the church. Why do I suffer more, much more, from what does not happen, than from what does?\" Still the notion clung to him for a little while, and he remained at the bottom of the pulpit quite needlessly for the next half hour, listening with all his might, in order to detect the slightest noise that might be indicative of the presence of a foe. But all was as still as the grave, and by slow degrees Sweeney Todd got more assured. \"I breathe again,\" he said. \"They do not suspect that I am here. It is much too unlikely a place for them to dream of for a moment. Even Sir Richard Blunt, with his utmost prescience, does not think of looking for me in the pulpit of St. Dunstan\u0027s Church. I am safe—I am safe for the present.\" He agreed with this feeling that he was quite alone in the church, and he was right. He looked over the edge of the pulpit. How still and solemn the place looked! The morning had advanced quite sufficiently now to shed a dim light into the church, and the noise in the street contingent upon the fire had nearly passed away. The fact was, that the firemen had, after making a few efforts and finding them of no use, let Todd\u0027s house burn to the ground, and turned all their efforts towards saving the edifices on either side. In that object they were successful, so that the conflagration was over, and nothing remained but the frail wall of Todd\u0027s house. And so the clank of the engine-pumps no longer sounded in his ears, but he could yet be certain that there was a great crowd in Fleet Street, for he heard the hum of voices, and occasionally the trouble that ensued when a vehicle tried to force its way through the dense mass of people that blocked up the thoroughfare, which at the best of times was none of the clearest. \"Is there a chance now of escape,\" said Todd, \"if I could only make up my mind to it? I do not forget that I am disguised—I ought not to forget that. Who will know me? and yet that man knew me—that man that I missed killing at the old place. Yes, he knew me. He said he could swear to me. Confound him! I wish I could have sworn to his dead body. I wonder if they have left the church-door open, or, rather, only upon the latch? I—I will descend from here, and make a bold attempt.\" He opened the pulpit-door, and had got about three steps down the little ornamental flight of winding stairs that led from the pulpit to the body of the building, when the church-door was suddenly opened, and he fled back with a precipitation that made some noise, when he might have done so in perfect quietness, for it was not very likely that any one would have looked up to the pulpit immediately upon their entrance to the building. A glance towards the door convinced Mr. Todd that it was the beadle. \"Oh, dear, I thought I heard something,\" said the beadle, as he closed the door after him. \"But I suppose it was only fancy, after all. Now they say that all the fire is out, and that it is quite impossible for the church to be blowed up, I suppose I may come in without any danger. Lor bless us, that Sir Richard Blunt, I do believe, would think no more of blowing up a beadle, than he would of eating a penny bun, that\u0027s my opinion of him.\" \"Curses on your head!\" muttered Todd. \"Bless me, what a world we live in,\" said the beadle. \"Wretch—beast,\" muttered Todd; \"what does he want here at this time of day?\" \"Yes, to-morrow\u0027s Sunday,\" said the beadle, as if pursuing a train of thought that had found a home in his brain. \"How the weeks do run round, to be sure, and one Sunday comes after another at such a rate, that it seems as if there was weeks and weeks and weeks of \u0027em, without any of the other days at all. I wish I hadn\u0027t to come here.\" Todd uttered faintly some dreadful imprecations, and the beadle continued talking to himself to keep his courage up, as was evident from his nervous and fidgetty manner. \"Ah, dear, me. Conwulsions! I tried to persuade my wife to come and dust the communion table and the pulpit-cushions for to-morrow, but she politely declined; she needn\u0027t have thrown the bellows at my head though, for all that.\" \"Dust the pulpit-cushions!\" thought Todd. \"The wretch is coming up here! I shall have to cut his throat, and leave him at the bottom of the pulpit for the parson to tread upon the first thing he does to-morrow, upon coming up here to preach.\" As Todd spoke, he took a clasped knife out of his pocket, and opened it with his teeth. \"Oh, yes, my old friend, I shall, I see, be under the painful necessity of cutting your throat, that I shall, and I shall not hesitate about it at all.\" \"Yes,\" added the beadle, \"I mean to say that to throw the bellows at the man is like adding insult to injury, for it is blowing him up in a kind of way that\u0027s anything but agreeable. Lor! how cold and rum the church does feel. Rum? why did I say rum and put myself in mind of it? Oh, don\u0027t I like it, rather! If I only now had a glass of real fine old Jamaica rum at this moment, I\u0027d be as happy as a bishop.\" \"Oh, I\u0027ll rum you!\" growled Todd. \"Eh? Eh?\" The beadle turned round three times, as though he were going to begin a game at blind-man\u0027s-bluff, and then he said— \"I thought I heard something. Oh dear, how shivery I do get to be sure, when I\u0027m alone in the church. I\u0027ll just get through the dusting job as quick as I can, and no mistake. Amen! Amen! I\u0027m a miserable sinner—Amen!\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276/89713.html","bookId":510,"book":{"id":510,"title":"The String of Pearls","description":"简介： The Romance of The String of Pearls having excited in the Literary world an almost unprecedented interest, it behoves the author to say a few words to his readers upon the completion of his labours....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
