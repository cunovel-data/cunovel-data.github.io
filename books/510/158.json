TODD GETS THE BETTER OF THE SHARPERS, AND TAKES A BOAT.","content":"The girl brought Todd a plate of roast-beef, a loaf, and some brandy, with which he regaled himself tolerably well; but he was uncomfortably conscious that the two men were looking at him all the while. \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"it\u0027s a very odd thing, but my appetite continues good notwithstanding all my infirmities. I eat well, and I drink well, and the doctors say that that is what keeps me alive.\" \"I should not wonder,\" said one of the men drily. \"Yes,\" said the other, with a laugh, \"you are like us, old gentleman; we live by victuals and drink.\" \"Ah, I didn\u0027t mean that,\" said Todd; \"you young people are so fond of your jokes. Dear me, when I was young I used to be fond of my joke, likewise, but now I am so old, that what with my winter cough, and the gout, and all that sort of thing, my joking days are long since gone by. I lost my poor wife, too, a little while ago—bless her heart! Ah, me!\" Todd had the greatest inclination in the world to make up one of his old diabolical faces at this juncture; but he restrained himself, for he felt the danger of doing so; and then affecting to wipe away a tear, he added— \"But I find my consolation in religion. There\u0027s where, gentlemen, an old man may look for comfort, and that strength of heart and soul, which in this world is denied to him.\" \"Very true, sir—very true.\" \"Ah, gentlemen, it is true; and there\u0027s nothing in all the world like an easy conscience. That\u0027s the sort of thing to make a man feel serene and happy in this world, while he is preparing for the joys of the next.\" \"How delightful it is, sir,\" said one of the men, \"for us to meet with a gentleman who has the same opinion as ourselves. Will you join us in a glass, sir, if you please?\" \"Oh, yes—yes, with pleasure. What a shocking bad fire, they tell me, has been in Fleet Street.\" \"Yes, it\u0027s the notorious Todd\u0027s house.\" \"In—deed!\" The man who had proposed the social glass rang the bell, and ordered three tumblers of brandy-and-water, and then he said— \"Ah, sir! if you or I could only lay hold of Sweeney Todd it would be rather a good day\u0027s work.\" \"Oh, dear, God forbid!\" said Todd. \"He would soon lay me low if I were to try to lay hold of him, with, as I may say in a manner of speaking, one foot in the grave. I am not, in the natural order of things, long for this world, gentlemen, and it is not for me to lay hold of desperate characters.\" \"That\u0027s true, sir; but do you know the reward that is offered for him by the Secretary of State?\" \"No! Is there really a reward for him?\" \"Yes, a thousand pounds clear to any one who will lodge him in any jail. A thousand pounds! Why, it makes a man\u0027s mouth water to think of it. One might retire, Bill, mightn\u0027t one, and give up all sorts of—\" Bill gave his enthusiastic comrade rather a severe cautionary kick under the table, and it seemed to have the effect of stopping the word \u0027thieving\u0027 from coming past his lips quite at unawares—at least that was the way Todd translated it. He had not the smallest doubt but that the public-house was a very indifferent one, and that the two men whom he was in company with in it were two of the most arrant thieves in all London. Todd resolved to act accordingly, and he did not let them see that he had the least suspicion of them; but he kept such a wary eye upon their movements, that nothing they did or looked escaped him. They little supposed that so keen an observer watched them as Sweeney Todd was. The brandy-and-water that had been ordered soon made its appearance; and Todd, while perpetrating a very well-acted fit of coughing, saw one of the men just slightly wink at the other, and take a little way from his waistcoat pocket a small bottle. \"Oh!\" thought Todd, \"my brandy-and-water will be prepared, I see; and if I do not look sharp, these fellows will rob me of all that I have run so much risk, and took so much trouble to get out of the old house.\" After a moment\u0027s thought, he rose and said— \"I will only go and pay for what I have had at the bar, and you must permit me likewise to pay for this.\" \"Oh, no—no!\" \"Oh, yes, but I will—I will! I dare say that I have the most money, after all, for I have been very careful in my time, and saved a trifle, so you must permit me.\" The two thieves were so delighted at getting rid of him for a few moments, that although they declared it was too bad, they let him go. The moment he was gone, one said to the other, with a grin— \"Bill, put a good dose into the old chap\u0027s glass. He has got a rare gold watch in his pocket, and there\u0027s a ring on his finger, that if it isn\u0027t a diamond, it\u0027s as near like one as ever I heard of. Give him a good dose.\" \"Well, but you know that even a few drops will settle him?\" \"Never mind that. It\u0027s all right enough; pour it in.\" They put enough of some deadly drug into the glass of brandy-and water that stood next to where Todd had been sitting to kill a horse; and then he returned and sat down with a groan, as he said— \"It\u0027s quite a funny thing! There\u0027s a man at the bar inquiring for somebody; and he\u0027s got a red waistcoat on.\" \"A red waistcoat!\" cried both the the thieves, jumping up. \"Did you say a red waistcoat?\" \"Why, yes; and I think he is what they call a Bow Street thingamy—Lord bless my old brain! what do they call them—\" \"A runner?\" \"Ah, to be sure, a Bow Street runner, to be sure.\" Both the thieves bundled out of the parlour in a moment, and Todd was not idle while they were gone. The first thing he did was to decant his own brandy-and-water—which had been drugged—into an empty glass. Then he filled his glass with the contents of one of the thieves\u0027 glasses. After that, he half filled that glass with the drugged spirit, and filled it up from the other thief\u0027s glass, and that again he filled up with the drugged spirit. By this means, each of them had half from the glass they had—as they thought—so very cleverly drugged for him, to drink from; and as they had not scrupled to put in an over dose, it may be fairly presumed that there was in each of their glasses quite enough to make them very uncomfortable. They both returned. \"There\u0027s nobody there now,\" said one. \"Are you sure you saw him, sir? We can\u0027t see any one.\" \"Didn\u0027t I tell you he was going away when I saw him? It was only the latch of the door catching his top-coat that made me see his red waistcoat; and it was a wonder then that I saw it, for I am not very noticeable in those things. Oh, dear, how bad my cough is.\" \"Take some of your brandy-and-water, sir,\" said one of the thieves, as he winked at the other. \"It will do you good, sir.\" \"Not a doubt of it,\" said the other. \"Do you think so? Well—well, perhaps it may. Here\u0027s my friendship to both of you, gentlemen; and I hope we shall none of us repent of this happy meeting. I am much pleased, gentlemen, to see you both, and hope the brandy-and-water will do us all a world of good. I will give you a toast, gentlemen.\" \"Ah, a toast!—a toast!\" \"But mind gentlemen, you must take a good draught, if you drink my toast—Will you?\" \"Will we? Ay, to be sure, if you will.\" \"I promise, gentlemen; so here\u0027s the toast—It\u0027s to the very cunning fox who laid a trap for another, and caught his own tail in it!\" \"What a droll toast!\" said the two thieves. They paused a moment, but as they saw their new friend drink at least one-half of his brandy-and-water in honour of the toast, they did the same thing, and looked at each other quite contented and pleased as possible that the drugged spirit, at the very first pull, had been so freely partaken of—for they had found, by experience, the victims they would have made perceived a disagreeable taste, and would not drink twice. \"Hilloa!\" said Todd. \"What\u0027s the matter, old gentleman?\" \"Do you know, this is very good brandy-and-water?\" \"Glad you like it.\" \"Like it?—I couldn\u0027t be off liking it. It\u0027s capital! Let\u0027s finish these glasses, and have others at once.\" As he spoke he finished his glass, and the two thieves were so delighted that he had taken it all, that they at once finished theirs likewise; and then they looked at him, and then at each other, until one said to the other, as he made a wry face— \"I say, Bill, I—I don\u0027t much like my glass. How did yours taste, eh, old fellow?\" \"Very queer.\" \"How strange,\" said Todd; \"mine was beautiful! I hope, gentlemen, you have not made a mistake and put anything out of the way in your own glasses instead of mine?\" \"Oh, dear. Oh—oh! I am going, Bill.\" \"And so am I. Oh, murder! My head is going round and round like a humming-top as big as St. Paul\u0027s.\" \"And so is mine.\" \"Then, gentlemen,\" said Todd, rising, \"I shall have the pleasure of bidding you good day, and I hope you have just sense enough left to appreciate the toast of the \u0027cunning fox that laid a trap for another, in which he caught his own tail,\u0027 and I have the further pleasure of informing you that I am Sweeney Todd.\" The two thieves, quite overcome by the powerful and death-dealing narcotic they had placed in the liquor, fell to the floor in a state of perfect insensibility, and Todd very calmly walked out of the public-house. Todd Turns The Tables On The Two Sharpers, And Escapes. Todd Turns The Tables On The Two Sharpers, And Escapes. \"This will not do,\" he said, when he reached the west-end of Holywell Street. \"I must not run such risks as this. I must now be off. But where to? That is the question. Out of London, of course. The river, I think—ay, the river. That will be the best. I will house myself until night, and then I will hire a boat and go to Gravesend. From there I shall not find much difficulty in getting on board some foreign vessel, and with what I have in my pockets I will bid adieu to England for a little while, until I can sell my watches and jewels, and then I will come back and have my revenge yet upon those whom I only live now to destroy.\" Full of these thoughts, Todd went down one of the narrow streets leading to the Thames, and as he saw a bill in a window of lodgings to let, he thought he should be safer there than in a house of public entertainment. He resolved upon taking a lodging for a week at any cost, and then leaving it in the evening after he should have had some rest at it, which he might do for the remainder of the day, provided the people would take him in, which he had very little doubt of them doing, as he did not intend to object to their terms, and he did intend to pay in advance. Todd knocked at the door. It was answered by a woman of the true landlady species, who, upon hearing that it was the lodging Todd was after, was all smiles and sweetness immediately. \"I have come up from the country, madam,\" said Todd, \"and my luggage is at an inn in Gracechurch Street. I intend to send for it in the morning; and as I am weary, if you can accommodate me with a lodging, as I have some business to transact for my son, the Deacon, in London, I shall be much obliged.\" \"Oh, dear, yes sir; walk in. We have every accommodation. The drawing-room floor, sir, at three guineas and a few extras.\" \"That will just do,\" said Todd. \"Will you be so good as to show me the rooms, madam?\" Todd saw the rooms, and of course admired them very much; and then he said, in the blandest manner— \"I think the rooms very cheap, madam, and will take them at once, if you please. The reference I will give you, is to the Principal of Magdalen College, Oxford, the Reverend Peter Sly, madam. My own name is Bones, and my son is the Reverend Archdeacon Bones. I will pay you now a week in advance; and all I have to beg of you is, that you do yourself justice as to charges. I will lie down and rest for a few hours, if you please, madam.\" \"Oh, dear, sir! yes, certainly, Mr. Bones. There shall be no noise to disturb you, and anything you want, if you will be so good as to ring for, I will supply you with the greatest pleasure.\" \"Thank you, madam.\" Thus then was it that Todd secured himself what appeared to be a wonderfully safe asylum until night. He got into the bed with all his clothes on; for he did not know how sudden the emergency might be that might induce him to rise; and he soon fell into a deep sleep, for he had undergone the greatest fatigues of late. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276/89715.html","bookId":510,"book":{"id":510,"title":"The String of Pearls","description":"简介： The Romance of The String of Pearls having excited in the Literary world an almost unprecedented interest, it behoves the author to say a few words to his readers upon the completion of his labours....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
