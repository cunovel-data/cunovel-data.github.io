THE ADVENTURES IN CAEN WOOD OF THE TWO MURDERERS.","content":"Todd was so much exhausted by the time they reached the wood, that he at once cast himself to the ground upon a heap of dry leaves, and he felt that he was speaking only the truth when he said— \"I could not go a step further just now, if it were to save my life, I feel that I could not; and here I must lie and rest.\" \"Dear me!\" said Mr. Lupin; \"what a poor creature you must be. How old are you, Mr. Todd?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Todd. \"The church I was christened at was burnt down only the day after, and all the books burnt. My father and mother are dead, and the nurse was hanged, and the doctor cut his throat.\" \"Upon my word,\" said Lupin, \"they were a lively set. I suppose it was remorse did all that?\" \"Remorse! What do you mean by remorse?\" \"Why that sort of feeling, you know, might be awakened in their minds, by finding that you were not exactly the sort of baby that was expected. You must have looked a beauty in long-clothes, Todd; and as for your age, I should guess it about fifty-five.\" \"Guess your own age,\" said Todd, \"and leave mine alone.\" \"Oh, if it\u0027s at all a sore subject I won\u0027t say another word about it. But come now, Todd, you charming creature, could you not manage to crawl a little way further?\" \"What for? If we are safe in the wood at all, we are safe enough here where we are now.\" \"But, my dear friend, you quite forget.\" \"What—what? What do I forget? Don\u0027t plague me, Lupin. It is enough just now to remember that we have by almost a miracle made an escape from Newgate; and as for forgetting, I would be right glad to forget if I could that I had ever been there; but that will be impossible.\" \"It won\u0027t be very easy,\" said Lupin, \"and if possible, it will take a long time; but what I was just mildly going to remind you of was, that in this wood your two thousand pounds, you know, are hidden, and that we were to share the amount.\" \"Ah, my dear friend, yes, I had not forgotten that little affair. It is, of course, very important; but let me rest a little, if you please.\" \"Oh, certainly—certainly.\" \"And then, my dear companion, it will be necessary to get a spade, you know, to dig it up. Our nails decidedly are neither long enough or strong enough, and I don\u0027t at all see how it is to be done without a spade, or something that shall be a good substitute for one.\" \"Oh, nonsense,\" said Lupin. \"How deep do you suppose it lies?\" \"About two feet.\" \"Very good then, you need give yourself no uneasiness about the digging it up. I have the chisel and the two files here; and if I can\u0027t dig two feet into the earth with them, and my hands to shovel out the mould with, I\u0027m a Dutchman, that\u0027s all. Only you show me the spot, that\u0027s all, and I won\u0027t ask you to tire yourself in the matter.\" \"In a little,\" said Todd, \"in a little. Without being so old as you would make me out, I am still older than you are Lupin, and cannot go through the amount of fatigue that you can. Just let me recover myself a little, and then instead of crawling to the spot where my money lies hidden, I shall be well able to walk to it and show it to you.\" \"Very good—very good. Of course I don\u0027t want to hurry you too much about the matter, only the sooner we do get a hold of the two thousand pounds the better. I wonder, too, that you don\u0027t feel rather anxious to see that it is quite safe, for some accident might have discovered it, for all you know to the contrary.\" \"Oh no, my friend, nothing but an earthquake could do that. You may depend it is quite safe where I put it. In a little time I shall be able to show you the exact spot, which I have so accurately in my mind\u0027s eye, that I can walk to it with the greatest of ease; of course I did not trust such a valuable deposit to the ground without accurately marking the spot that I had made my bank.\" \"Is it in gold?\" \"All—all. I did think of hiding notes, but I was afraid that the damp, if there should come any heavy rains, would have the effect of rotting them, and I had no iron box sufficiently small to place them in; so I brought all gold, and a good weight it was too.\" \"Ah, we will make that weight light by dividing it.\" \"Just so.\" Lupin\u0027s mouth actually watered at the idea of getting possession of such a sum, and as he turned his head aside, he muttered to himself— \"If I don\u0027t put Todd out of this world, and save the hangman the trouble, it shall go hard with me, and then I shall have all the money to myself, and I can get to America, and be a free and enlightened citizen for the remainder of my days.\" Mr. Lupin could hardly forbear an audible chuckle over this delightful prospect; so that it will be seen that both of these villains meditated evil intentions towards each other, from which it may be gathered how much faith is to be put in the association of men for any guilty design. Was it likely that such persons as Todd and Lupin, after being false and ruffianly to all the world, should be true to each other, except so far as their common interests dictated? No, Todd amused Lupin with the story of the buried gold in the wood at Hampstead, because he, Lupin, was of assistance in his escape from Newgate; and Lupin assisted him to escape with the idea of murdering him in the wood, and securing for himself all the money that he believed was there hidden! It was quite evident that Lupin was desperately impatient at the rest Todd was taking, previous to showing him where the money was hidden; and he walked to and fro, looking as vexed as possible, and yet fearing to say too much, lest he should get up a quarrel, the result of which might be, that Todd would refuse to show him where the gold was at all. \"I think,\" he said, \"if I were to manage to get a good thick stave off some tree, it would help considerably in digging, would it not?\" \"Without a doubt,\" said Todd. \"Then I will try, and by the time I have got it, perhaps you will be rested enough, my dear friend, to make an effort to get up and show me the spot where to dig for the gold.\" \"I shouldn\u0027t wonder,\" said Todd. Mr. Lupin found that he was obliged to be contented with this doubtful acquiescence of Todd\u0027s; and he busied himself, by the aid of the chisel and the files, in getting off a stout strong bough from a sycamore-tree, which he shaped to a tolerable point. It looked like a formidable bludgeon; and as he eyed it, he thought what a capital knock on the head it would give to Mr. Todd. It was rather odd that the same idea crossed Todd\u0027s mind, and as he saw the bit of wood, he muttered to himself— \"That would do it. One blow from that would do it.\" Now, Todd had but one solitary incentive to the murder of Lupin, and that was, that he feared when he found out how he had been deceived regarding the money, he would find some mode of denouncing him to the police, while he took care of himself; and, therefore, upon that mere idea, Todd would take his life. But then, steeped in blood guiltiness as Todd was, the taking the life of any one always seemed to him to be the readiest way of solving any difficulty connected with them. It was his motive to consider that that was the shortest and easiest mode of settling the affair, if any one became at all troublesome; and he was not all likely to make an exception in favour of such a personage as Mr. Lupin. \"All ready?\" said Lupin. \"Are you rested now?\" \"Yes,\" said Todd, as he rose. \"Ah, dear me, yes, as much as I can expect, until I get a regular night\u0027s repose, you know, friend Lupin. But I don\u0027t expect that very soon.\" \"Oh, who knows? We are continually, in this world, getting what we don\u0027t expect, and not getting what we do; so you may rest easy enough, Todd, much sooner than you expect. Come, lean on my arm if you feel fatigued.\" \"Oh, no, thank you. Lend me the stick, it will help me on the best, for it seems just about my height.\" Lupin could not very well refuse Todd\u0027s request with any prospect of keeping him in good humour at the same time, so he gave him the stick, although it must be confessed he did not do so with the very best grace in the world. But Todd did get it, and that satisfied him. \"Is it far off?\" said Lupin. \"Oh dear, no. Quite close at hand—quite close. There\u0027s a small chesnut-tree, and a large chesnut-tree, and there\u0027s a small fir-tree and a large fir-tree, and a large oak-tree and a small oak-tree, and then there is a blackberry bush and a little stream of water.\" \"Good gracious, is there anything else?\" said Lupin. \"No, my dear friend, that is all.\" \"Well. I must confess, that your description would not have very materially assisted me in finding the spot.\" \"Indeed, I thought nothing could possibly be more clear.\" \"Clear to you, Mr. Todd, it may be, but not to any one else; but that don\u0027t matter a bit as you are here yourself to point out the exact spot. Are we near it now?\" \"Yes, you see that cluster of bushes?\" \"Yes, oh yes.\" \"Well, the money lies hidden right in there, and you cannot miss it if you scramble in.\" \"Lend me the stick to clear away the brambles and the nettles, and I will creep in.\" \"My dear friend, I shall fall down if I lend you the stick. There is no difficulty in getting in. Don\u0027t you see there is a gap that you have only to push through, and there you are?\" \"Well—well,\" said Lupin. \"That\u0027s enough; I will get through. Come on, let us secure the gold.\" Lupin stooped to push his way through the gap in the hedge, for the bushes grew so close together just there, that they resembled an enclosure carefully planted on purpose. Then Todd took the heavy stick that had been cut from the sycamore tree in both hands, and swinging it in the air, he brought it down with a stunning crack on the back of Lupin\u0027s head, just at the juncture of the neck. \"God!\" said Lupin, and it was the first time in his life that, with true sincerity, he had pronounced that sacred name. He then turned and sunk to the ground, with his face towards Todd. He could not speak now, but the look that he gave to his murderer was awful in the extreme. The injury he had received had quite paralysed him, and his hands hung helplessly. But the quality of mercy belonged not to Todd\u0027s composition. Again the huge stick was raised, and this time it fell upon the top of Lupin\u0027s head. The wretched man uttered one faint sigh and expired at once. \"Dead!\" said Todd, as he stood gaunt and erect before his victim, with the stick stretched out in his hand. \"Dead—quite dead. Ha!\" Todd Kills The Murderer, Lupin. Todd Kills The Murderer, Lupin. Todd made one of his old faces. He must at that moment have fancied himself engaged upon his ancient business in the cellars beneath his house in Fleet Street, or he never could have made the sort of face which had become so very incidental to him in that locality. The body fell huddled up, and the change that rapidly took place in the countenance, was something truly awful to behold; but it had not much effect upon Todd. He had struck many a man down to rise no more, against whom he had no cause of suspicion or of dread; and it was not likely that he would scruple to do so to one whom he both feared and hated as he did Mr. Lupin. \"That is done!\" said Todd, as he slowly let his arm droop until the stick touched the ground; and then relinquishing his grasp of it, he let it fall entirely. \"That is done!\" A slight noise close at hand made the murderer start, and caused the blood to turn cold around his heart from very abject fear that there had been some witness to his crime. \"What was that?\" he said, \"what was that?\" All was still again. It was but some wild bird taking flight from a low branch of a neighbouring tree, not liking the vicinity of man, and especially such a man as Mr. Todd; for we may well suppose even those little feathered fragile things are gifted with some of that physiognomical power that seems to be an attribute or an instinct of all animals, with regard to the human race. \"It was nothing,\" said Todd very gently. \"It was nothing at all. This has been an easily done deed, and a safe one. Nearly noiseless, too. It may be many a long day ere the body be discovered. I will drag it in among the bushes, so as to hide it for as long a space as may be, else if it were found early it would be a kind of index to my route, and would, at all events, show that I had been here.\" Full of this idea, Todd laid hold of the body and turned it back upwards. He even did not like to look in the face more than he could help. Then seizing the corpse by the collar of his coat, he dragged it into the hollow space among the bushes, and cast it down, saying as he did so— \"Rest you there, Mr. Lupin. I have only saved the hangman, after all, the trouble of taking your life, for I can feel well assured, that such would have been your end. You thought yourself a clever fellow, but after all you were nothing to me. Rest there; you were useful up to the moment that we reached the wood, and were in comparative safety. After that, you became an encumbrance, and so I have got rid of you, as I am in the habit of doing all such encumbrances to my views.\" Sweeney Todd then crept out from among the bushes, and after having cast the stick with which he had done the murder in among the bushes on top of the body, he walked rapidly away to another part of the wood. Ever and anon he stopped to listen if he could catch the slightest indication of the presence of any one else in the wood; but all was still, save now and then the song of some wild bird, as it lit for a few moments upon the branch of some tree, to warble a few notes, and then dart off again into the fresh and fragrant air. \"I am safe here,\" muttered Todd, \"I am safe here for the present, and until nightfall I will remain; but between this time and sunset, I must determine what I shall do, and it must be done quickly, for on the morrow the pursuit will be of a wider, as well as of a closer character than what it has been to-day.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276/89699.html","bookId":510,"book":{"id":510,"title":"The String of Pearls","description":"简介： The Romance of The String of Pearls having excited in the Literary world an almost unprecedented interest, it behoves the author to say a few words to his readers upon the completion of his labours....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
