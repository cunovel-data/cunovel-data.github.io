TODD IS COMMITTED FOR TRIAL, AND EXPECTS THE WORST.","content":"By the time the police office at Bow Street opened upon the morning, a wild vague, and uncertain sort of rumour had spread itself over London, concerning the discoveries that had been made at Todd\u0027s house in Fleet Street, and at Mrs. Lovett\u0027s in Bell Yard, Temple Bar. Of course, the affair had lost nothing from many-tongued rumour, and the popular belief was, that Todd\u0027s house had been found full of dead bodies from the attics to the cellars, while Mrs. Lovett had been actually detected in the very act of scraping some dead man\u0027s bones, for tid-bits to make a veal pie of. A dense crowd had assembled in Fleet Street, to have a look at Todd\u0027s now shut-up house, and that thoroughfare very soon, in consequence, became no thoroughfare at all. Bell Yard too was so completely blocked up, that the lawyers who were in the habit of using it as a short cut from the Temple to Lincoln\u0027s Inn, were forced to take the slight round of Chancery Lane instead; and the confusion and general excitement in the whole of the neighbourhood was immense. But it was in Bow Street, and round the doors of the police-office, that the densest crowd, and the greatest excitement prevailed. There it was only with the greatest difficulty that the officers and others officially connected with the public office could get in and out of it as occasion required; and the three or four magistrates who thought proper to attend upon that occasion, had quite a struggle to get into the court at all. By dint of great perseverance, our friends, with Sir Richard Blunt, at length succeeded in forcing a passage through the crowd, to the magistrates private entrance, and having once passed that, they were no longer in the smallest degree incommoded. \"Well, Crotchet,\" said Sir Richard, as he encountered that individual, \"Have you been to Newgate this morning?\" \"Rather, Sir Richard.\" \"Any news?\" \"No. Only that Todd has been a trying it on a little, that\u0027s all.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Why he\u0027s only petikler anxious to save Jack Ketch any trouble on his account, that\u0027s all, Sir Richard; so he\u0027s been trying to put himself out o\u0027 this here world, and shove himself into t\u0027other, without going through all the trouble of being hung, that\u0027s all, sir.\" \"I fully expected that both Todd and Mrs. Lovett would make some such attempts; but I hope the governor of Newgate has been sufficiently careful to prevent the possibility of either of them succeeding.\" \"It\u0027s all right,\" added Crotchet. \"I seed \u0027em both, and they is as lively as black beetles as has been trod on by somebody as isn\u0027t a very light weight.\" The doors of the court had not been opened, but when they were, the struggle for admission was tremendous, and it required the utmost exertions of the officers of the establishment to keep anything like a semblance of order. The few night charges were rapidly disposed of, and while a gentleman who looked very foolish, was fined five shillings for being drunk and disorderly the evening previous, a roaring shout from the mob in the street proclaimed the arrival of the two important prisoners from Newgate. Up to some time after his arrest, Todd, notwithstanding some stray words that would indicate a contrary state of things, fully believed that he had succeeded in murdering Mrs. Lovett, and it was not until the morning that he became aware of her escape from drowning in the Thames. It did not require a conjuror to tell the authorities that there would be some trouble in getting the prisoners to Bow Street, so it was thought better to make one job of it, and to place Todd and Mrs. Lovett in the same coach along with four officers. With this intent the coach was brought close to the wicket-gate of Newgate, and Todd and Mrs. Lovett, well guarded, were brought to the lobby at the same moment. The moment Todd caught sight of Mrs. Lovett, a kind of spasm seemed to shake his frame, and pointing to her, he cried— \"Does that woman indeed live, or is she but some fiend in the shape of such a one come to torment me?\" \"That is Mrs. Lovett,\" said the Governor. \"Oh, no—no—no,\" added Todd, \"it is not so—it cannot be. The dark rolling river cannot so give up its dead.\" \"You were well disposed that it should not,\" said Mrs. Lovett, bending upon Todd a most ferocious glance. \"She is saved!\" gasped Todd. \"Yes, I am saved to your confusion. I call you all to witness,\" she then added in a loud voice, \"that I had no idea of the extent of Todd\u0027s iniquity; but what I do know I will freely tell as evidence for the crown against him.\" Mrs. Lovett looked peculiarly at the Governor while she uttered these words, for she was anxious to know what he thought of them, but that functionary took not the remotest notice. At this moment one of the warders announced the sheriff, and one of the Sheriffs of London with his gold chain of office on, appeared in the lobby. To him Mrs. Lovett immediately turned, saying— \"Sir, I offer myself as king\u0027s evidence. Do you understand me?\" \"Perfectly, madam; but I have nothing to do with the matter.\" \"Nothing to do, sir? Then why do you wear that bauble?\" \"My office, so far as you are concerned, madam, will be to keep you in safe custody, and see that the sentence of the law is carried into effect upon you, in case you should be convicted of the crimes laid to your charge.\" \"But I turn king\u0027s evidence. It is quite a common thing that you have all heard of that often enough.\" \"Now, madam, the coach is ready,\" said a turnkey. \"Where are you going to take me? Is not this Newgate?\" \"Yes, but you must undergo an examination at the police-office in Bow Street.\" Without any further ceremony, Mrs. Lovett was handed into the coach, and Todd after her. She was at first placed in the seat immediately opposite to him, but she insisted upon changing it, saying, that she could not bear to look at him all the way that she went, and as it was a matter of no moment which way she sat, the officers so far indulged her as to permit her to change her place. In this way then, both of them upon the same seat, while three officers sat opposite to them, and one with them, dividing them, they arrived at Bow Street, and were met by that roaring shout, that everybody had heard, from without the court. Of course every precaution had been taken to prevent the mob from wreaking their vengeance upon the criminals, which they were well-disposed to do. A number of people were knocked down and some of the officers rather roughly treated; but the result was, that Todd and Mrs. Lovett were got into the office in safety. Sweeney Todd, as he ascended the steps of the office, turned his head for a moment, and looked at the sea of angry faces that was in the street. He shuddered and passed on. Mrs. Lovett did not look round at all. With great difficulty the door of the office was closed, and then in a few moments Todd and Mrs. Lovett were placed side by side at the bar of justice. There was one person sitting on the bench near to Sir Richard Blunt, upon whom Todd fixed his eyes in amazement. That person was Johanna Oakley. The features came at once to his recollection, and as though he really doubted if he were awake or not, he more than once pressed his hand upon his eyes. Todd And Mrs. Lovett At Bow Street Police Office. Todd And Mrs. Lovett At Bow Street Police Office. His and every one else\u0027s attention were, however, speedily taken up by the conduct of Mrs. Lovett. The moment comparative order was restored in the crowded court, so that what she said could be distinctly and clearly heard, she spoke— \"I am willing to turn king\u0027s evidence upon this occasion, and to declare all I know of Todd\u0027s nefarious transactions. I am quite willing to tell all—I don\u0027t perhaps know the full extent of Todd\u0027s guilt, but I repeat I will turn king\u0027s evidence, and tell all I do know.\" A gentleman, plainly dressed in black, rose new, and in a calm, assured voice, said— \"Upon the part of the crown I reject the offer of the female prisoner. Anything she may say will be used as evidence against her, if it bear that construction.\" \"Reject?\" cried Mrs. Lovett. \"And pray, sir, who are you that you dare reject such a proposition for furthering the ends of justice?\" \"That, madam, is the Attorney-General,\" said an officer. \"Oh,\" said Mrs. Lovett, \"and am I to understand that I am accused of any participation in Todd\u0027s crimes?\" \"You will find by the evidence that will be adduced against you of what you are accused,\" said the magistrate. \"You, I believe, Sir Richard Blunt, give these people in charge?\" \"Yes,\" said Sir Richard rising. \"I charge them with, in the first place, the wilful murder of Charles James Thornhill. If your worship should think fit, from the evidence that will be brought forward, to commit them upon that charge, I shall not at present trouble you with any others, although I am fully prepared with several.\" \"What is the meaning of all this?\" cried Mrs. Lovett. \"I will be heard.\" Sir Richard Blunt paid no manner of attention to her, but brought before the magistrate quite sufficient evidence to warrant him in committing both the prisoners for trial. The only great effect that the proceedings seemed to have upon Todd consisted in his surprise when Johanna Oakley came forward, and to her examination he listened attentively indeed. When she related how, under the name of Charles Green, she had taken the situation of errand boy at Todd\u0027s shop, and been in daily communication with Sir Richard Blunt, Todd dashed his clenched fist against his own head, crying— \"Dolt—Idiot—idiot! and I did suspect it once!\" Johanna went on then to state how in hunting over Todd\u0027s shop and house for some vestige of Mark Ingestrie, the sleeve of a seaman\u0027s jacket was found, which she had thought belonged to him, but which would be identified by the captain of the ship as having been part of Mr. Thornhill\u0027s apparel when he went on shore upon that fatal morning of his murder, no doubt by Todd. The evidence against Mrs. Lovett consisted of the fact of there being an underground communication all the way from the cellars of Todd\u0027s house to her cooking concern; and Mark Ingestrie had quite enough to tell of that to make it tolerably clear they acted in concert. Of course there could be but one opinion in the minds of all present of the guilt of the prisoners; but it was necessary that that guilt should be legally as well as morally proved, and hence the evidence was very carefully arranged to meet the exigencies of the case. \"Have you any legal adviser?\" said the Magistrate to Todd. \"No,\" was the brief response. The same question was put to Mrs. Lovett, but she did not answer, and the death-like paleness of her countenance sufficiently testified that it was out of her power to do so. In another moment, overcome by dread and chagrin, she fainted. \"Is she dead?\" said Todd. No one replied to the question, and he added— \"Look to her well or she will yet baffle you. If ever the spirit of a fiend found a home in any human brain it is in that woman\u0027s. I say to you, look to her well, or she will still baffle you all by some rare device you little dream of.\" Mrs. Lovett in her insensible state was carried from the court, and a surgeon was in prompt attendance upon her. It was found that there was nothing the matter with her; she had merely fainted through sheer vexation of spirit at finding that her overtures to be evidence against Todd were not attended to in the way she had wished; for now, with the loss of everything but life, how glad she would have been to back out of those odious transactions which clung to her. Todd was asked if he had anything to say. \"Really,\" he said. \"I do not know what it is all about. I am a poor humble man, who get but a scanty living by shaving any kind customer, and all this must be some desperate conspiracy against me on the part of the Roman Catholic, I think.\" \"The Roman Catholics?\" \"Yes, your worship. I never would shave or dress the hair of a Roman Catholic if I knew it, and more than one of that religion have sworn to be avenged upon me.\" \"And is this your defence?\" \"Yes, exactly; it is all I can say; and if I perish, it will be as one of the most innocent of men who ever was persecuted to death.\" \"Well,\" said the magistrate, \"I have heard many a singular defence, but never one like this.\" \"It\u0027s—it\u0027s truth,\" said Todd, \"that staggers your worship.\" \"Well, you can try what effect it will have upon a jury. I commit you for trial on the charge of wilful murder.\" \"Murder of whom?\" \"Charles James Thornhill.\" \"Oh, your worship, he is alive and well, and now in Havannah. If I have murdered him, where is the body?\" \"We are prepared,\" said the Attorney General, \"with that objection. At the trial we will tell the jury where the body is.\" Mrs. Lovett, now having sufficiently recovered, was brought into court to hear that she was committed for trial, but she made no remark upon that circumstance whatever; and in the course of a few moments another shout from the multitude without announced that the prisoners were off to Newgate.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276/89681.html","bookId":510,"book":{"id":510,"title":"The String of Pearls","description":"简介： The Romance of The String of Pearls having excited in the Literary world an almost unprecedented interest, it behoves the author to say a few words to his readers upon the completion of his labours....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
