{"id":12077,"no":105,"title":"CHAPTER CII. TAKES A SLIGHT GLANCE AT TOBIAS AND HIS INTENDED.","content":"The idea of the cook being starved to death, had quite reconciled Todd to the notion of leaving him alone; so he left the shop, and proceeded to his own domicile in Fleet Street, and as nothing of great moment has occurred during his absence, we will take the liberty of conducting the reader to the house of Colonel Jeffery, and taking a slight peep at our old friend Tobias, whom we left in rather a critical position. Tobias had been in so delicate a condition, prior to the last outrage of Todd at the colonel\u0027s house, that one might suppose such a thing would go far towards terminating his mortal career, and so indeed it did; but in youth there is such a tenacity to life that we may fairly look for the most extraordinary things in the shape of clinging to the vital principle, and in the way of getting over injuries. Poor Tobias was, to be sure, thrown back by Todd\u0027s attack, but he was not destroyed. The medical man gave it as his opinion, that the mental shock was by far worse than the physical injury, and he said to the colonel— \"Some means must be devised to make him believe that he is quite free from any further attack upon the part of Todd, or he will never recover. He will awaken, it is true, from the trance he is now in, but it will be to all the horrors and dread of some expected fresh attack from Todd.\" \"But I will assure him of my protection,\" said the colonel. \"I will in the most positive manner tell him that he shall here be perfectly safe from that man.\" \"Excuse me, colonel,\" replied the surgeon, \"but all that was done before, and yet Tobias has found that Todd reached him, even in one of the rooms of this house. You will find that he will be very sceptical regarding your powers to protect him now from that bold and infamous man. I hope I am not offending you, colonel, by my plain speaking?\" \"Not at all my dear sir, not at all. Do not think of such a thing. Plain speaking, when it is dictated by friendly feeling, is one of the most admirable things in all the world, and no one can possibly admire it more than I do. I feel, too, the full force of what you have said, and that to the ears of Tobias it would sound like a farce for me to offer to protect him from the further assaults of Sweeney Todd.\" \"But something may be done that is quite of a decisive character upon the subject, colonel.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean, that to sick folks I say anything that I think will tend to their recovery, even although I may feel that I am a little transgressing the bounds of truth. We must consider what we say to people in the position of Tobias, as so much medicine artfully administered to him.\" \"I quite agree with you, and I feel that you have some important suggestion to make to me regarding Tobias. What is it?\" \"Then, colonel, if I were you, I should not hesitate for one moment to tell him that Todd was dead.\" \"Dead?\" \"Yes, that is the only thing that will thoroughly convince Tobias he has nothing further to fear from him. I think it not only one of those delusions that are in themselves harmless, but I think it a justifiable dose of moral medicine.\" \"It shall be done,\" said the colonel. \"It shall be done. I do not hesitate about it for a moment. I thank you for the idea, and if that will do Tobias any good, he shall have the full benefit of it at my hands. Shall we seek him now?\" \"Yes, I hope that he is in a state to fully comprehend what is said to him, and in that case the sooner we say this from which we expect such good results, the better it will be. I am most anxious to witness the effect it will have upon his mind, colonel. If I mistake not, it will be one far exceeding anything you can suppose.\" Upon this they both went up stairs to the chamber in which poor Tobias lay. The boy was upon a bed, lying to all appearance bereft of sense. His breathing was rather laborious, and every now and then there was a nervous twitching of the muscles of the face, which bespoke how ill at ease the whole system was. At times too he would mutter some incoherent words, during which both the medical man and the colonel thought they could distinguish the name of Todd. \"Yes,\" said the surgeon, \"that is the spectre that is ever present to the imagination of this poor boy and we must speedily get rid of it from him, or it will assuredly kill him. I would not answer for his life another twenty-four hours, if his fancy were still to continue to be tortured by an expectation of the appearance of Todd.\" \"Will you, or shall I, speak to him?\" \"You, if you please, colonel; he knows your voice better no doubt than he does mine.\" Colonel Jeffery bent his head close down to Tobias\u0027s ear, and in a clear correct voice spoke to him. \"Tobias, I have come to say something very important to you. It is something which I hope will do you good to hear. Do you comprehend me, Tobias?\" The sufferer uttered a faint groan, as he tossed one of his arms uneasily about upon the coverlet. \"You quite understand me, Tobias? Only say that you do so, and I shall be satisfied to go on, and say to you what I have to say.\" \"Todd, Todd!\" gasped Tobias. \"Oh, God! coming—he is coming.\" \"You hear,\" said the surgeon. \"That is what his imagination runs upon. That is proof conclusive.\" \"It is, poor boy,\" said the colonel. \"But I wish I could get him to say that he fully comprehends my words.\" \"Never mind that. I would recommend that you make the communication to him at once, and abruptly. It will, in all likelihood, thus have more effect than if you dilute it by any great note of preparation before it reaches his ears.\" The Colonel nodded his acquiescence; and then, once more inclining his mouth to Tobias\u0027s ear, he said, in clear and moderately loud accents— \"Sweeney Todd is dead!\" Tobias at once sprang up to a sitting posture in the bed, and cried— \"No, no! Is it really so?\" \"Yes,\" added the colonel. \"Sweeney Todd is dead.\" For a moment or two Tobias looked from the colonel to the surgeon, and from the surgeon to the colonel, with a bewildered expression of countenance, and then burst into tears. \"That will do,\" said the surgeon. \"It has succeeded?\" whispered the colonel. \"Fully. It could not do better. He will recover full consciousness now when those tears are over. All will go well with him; but do not, by word or look, insinuate the remotest doubt of the truth of what you have told him. It would be better to say the same thing to any of the servants that may come about him.\" \"I will—I will; and particularly to his master, whom I would as soon trust with a secret as I would with the command of a regiment of cavalry.\" Tobias wept for the space of about ten minutes, and then he looked up with a face in which there was a totally different expression to what it had borne but a short time previously, and with a faltering voice he spoke— \"And so Todd is gone at last?\" \"He has,\" replied the colonel; \"and, therefore, you may now, Tobias, make your mind quite easy about him.\" \"Oh, quite—quite!\" By the long breath that Tobias drew, it was evident what an exquisite relief it was to him to be able to feel that the man who had been the bane of his young life was no more. No assurance of protection from him could have come near the feeling of satisfaction that he now felt in the consciousness of such a release. But Todd being dead, settled the affair at once. There was no drawback upon his satisfaction. \"Oh!\" he said, \"I do indeed feel that life is with me again, and that I can be happy. Where is Minna?\" \"She cannot remain here always,\" replied the colonel; \"but she will be in the house shortly, upon a visit to your mother, and you shall yourself have the pleasure of communicating the welcome news of Todd\u0027s death to her—news which to her bears as great a significance as it does to you.\" \"Oh, yes,\" replied Tobias. \"Minna will be pleased. We ought not to rejoice at the death of any one; but then Todd was so very, very bad a man, that his dying is a good thing, as it keeps him from loading his soul with more wickedness.\" \"That,\" said the medical man, \"is the proper view to take of the matter, Tobias; but now you will permit me to say to you that you should not talk too much, nor overtax your young strength. I will darken the room, by closing the shutters; and it is highly desirable that you should enjoy a few hours calm sleep, which now, with the conviction that Todd is dead, I do not see any difficulty in your doing.\" \"Oh, no—no,\" said Tobias, with quite a bright expression upon his face. \"Oh, no. I shall sleep well now. Quite well, for what have I to fear now?\" These few words were spoken in such a tone of calm composure, that the colonel had every reason to rejoice in the experiment he had tried, upon the advice of the medical man. The latter closed the shutters of the room all but one, so that there was but a soft and chastened light in the room; and then, with a smile upon his face, Tobias—after hoping that they would arouse him when Minna should come, and receiving a promise that way—turned his face to his pillow, and composed himself to the first pure rest he had had since the attack that the villain Todd had made upon him in the colonel\u0027s house. \"It is not much of a deception,\" said Colonel Jeffery to the surgeon, when the latter was leaving the house, \"for I believe now that Todd\u0027s hours are indeed numbered. He will be arrested to-night.\" \"I am glad to hear it,\" replied the surgeon. \"Such a notable villain ought to be as quickly as possible put out of the world.\" \"He ought, indeed; and from what I hear from Sir Richard Blunt, I believe that before twenty-four hours are gone over my head, the whole of London will ring with the name of Todd, and the story of his frightful criminality.\" Tobias slept quietly, and securely for four hours, during which space of time he was twice visited by Minna Gray, who had arrived while he was in that state of repose. The colonel, although he felt the danger of letting Mrs. Ragg know that the report to Tobias of the death of Todd was premature, felt no such scruple with regard to Minna. Indeed he considered that it would have been an insult to her judgment not to have told her exactly how the case stood. When she heard it all, and upon visiting Tobias\u0027s bed-room, found what a sweet sleep he was in, and what a quiet gentle smile was upon his face, she tearfully acknowledged what a good thing the innocent deception was which had produced such a result. \"It will save him,\" she said. \"It will,\" replied the colonel; \"and be sure that you keep sufficient guard over yourself to keep from betraying the secret.\" \"Oh, sir, trust me, I will.\" \"And remember that in this house, Minna, it is known only to you and to me. If Tobias should ask you anything about it, you had better know nothing, for I promised him that he should have the pleasure of making the communication to you himself, therefore you cannot be puzzled by any questions regarding particulars when he is your informant.\" Minna joyfully concurred with all that the colonel said upon this head; and then, after a long talk with Mrs. Ragg in the kitchen—that good lady having the most implicit faith in the story of the death of Todd, and the profoundest hope that she should soon hear the full particulars of that event—she betook herself to the bedside of Tobias, there to await his awakening. When he did open his eyes, they were clear and bright, and the fever had left his brow and cheeks. The first object his eye rested upon was Minna, and the first words he said were— \"Todd is dead!\" \"Ah, then, Tobias, you have nothing now to fear, for you have not an enemy in the world.\" \"No,\" he cried, \"I have now nothing to fear—but, my Minna, my own, my beautiful! how much I have to love! We shall be now, Minna, very, very happy, indeed, and God will bless me for your dear sake!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276/89662.html","bookId":510,"book":{"id":510,"title":"The String of Pearls","description":"简介： The Romance of The String of Pearls having excited in the Literary world an almost unprecedented interest, it behoves the author to say a few words to his readers upon the completion of his labours....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
