SIR RICHARD PRIES INTO TODD\u0027S SECRETS.","content":"Crotchet soon reached the attic floor of the shoemaker\u0027s house, and although in profound darkness, he managed, as he thought, to touch the right door. Tap! tap! went Crotchet\u0027s knuckles, and as he did so he followed a habit very general, when the knock is only a matter of ceremony, and opened the door at the same moment. He popped his head into a room where there was a light, and said— \"Here yer is.\" A scream was the reply to him, and then Crotchet saw, by the state of affairs there, that he had made a little mistake in the topography of the attic landing. The attic in which he found himself, for he had crossed the threshold, was in the occupation of an elderly gaunt-looking female, who was comforting her toes by keeping them immersed in a pan of water by the side of a little miserable fire, which was feebly pretending to look cheerful in the little grate. \"Lor, mum!\" said Crotchet. \"Who\u0027d a thought o\u0027 seeing of you?\" \"Oh, you monster. You base man, what do you want here?\" \"Nothink!\" \"Be off with you, or else I\u0027ll call the perlice.\" \"Oh, I\u0027m a going, mum. How do you bring it in, mum, in a general way?\" \"Help! Murder!\" \"Lord bless us, what a racket. Don\u0027t you go for to fancy, mum, that I comed up these here attic stairs for to see you. Quite the rewerse, mum.\" \"Then, pray who did you come to see, you big ugly monster you? The other attic is empty. Oh, you base infidel. I believe I knows what men are by this time.\" \"No doubt on it, mum. Howsomedever this here\u0027s the wrong door, I take it. No harm done, mum. I wish you and your toes, mum, a remarkably good evening.\" \"Crotchet,\" said a voice. \"Here yer is.\" Sir Richard Blunt had been attentively listening for Crotchet, and when he heard the screams of the old lady in the next attic, he opened the door of his apartment, and looked out. He soon discovered what was amiss, and called out accordingly. \"Bless us, who\u0027s that?\" \"The Emperor o\u0027 Russia, mum,\" said Crotchet. \"He\u0027s took that \u0027ere attic next to you, cos he\u0027s heard so much o\u0027 the London chumbley pots, and he wants to have a good look at them at his leisure.\" With these words Mr. Crotchet left the old lady\u0027s attic, and closed the door carefully, leaving her, no doubt, in a considerable state of bewilderment. In another moment he was with the magistrate. \"Crotchet,\" said Sir Richard, \"I thought I told you to do this thing as quietly as you possibly could.\" \"Down as a hammer, sir.\" \"I think it is anything but down.\" \"Right as a trivet, sir, with a hextra leg. Lots o\u0027 fear, but no danger. Now for it, Sir Richard. What lay is we to go on?\" It certainly never occurred to Sir Richard Blunt to hold any argument with Mr. Crotchet. He had long since found out that he must, if he would avail himself of his services—and for courage and fidelity he was unequalled—put up with his eccentricities; so upon this occasion he said no more about Crotchet\u0027s mistake, but, after a few moments\u0027 pause, pointing to the attic door, he said— \"Secure it.\" \"All\u0027s right.\" Crotchet took a curious little iron instrument from his pocket, and secured it into the wall by the side of the door. It did not take him more than a moment to do so, and then, fully satisfied of the efficacy of his work, he said— \"Let \u0027em get over that if they can.\" While he was so occupied. Sir Richard Blunt himself had opened the window, and fastened it open securely. \"Now, Crotchet,\" he said, \"look to your pistols.\" \"All\u0027s right, sir.\" The magistrate carefully examined the priming of his own arms, and seeing that all was right, he at once emerged from the attic through the window on to the parapet of the house. He might have crept along the gutter just within the parapet, but the gutter aforesaid was not exactly in the most salubrious condition. Indeed, from its filthy state, one might have fancied it to be peculiarly under the direction of the city commissioners of sewers. Crotchet followed Sir Richard closely, and in a moment or two they had traversed a sufficient portion of the parapet to find themselves at the attic window of Todd\u0027s house. It would have been next thing to a miracle if they had been seen in their progress, for the roof was very dark coloured, and the night had fairly enough set in, so that if any one had by chance looked up from the street below, they would scarcely have discovered that there was anybody creeping along the parapet. Now there was a slight creaking noise for about half a minute, and then the window of Sweeney Todd\u0027s attic swung open. \"Come on,\" said Sir Richard, and he softly alighted in the apartment. Crotchet followed him, and then the magistrate carefully closed the window again, and left it in such a way, that a touch from within would open it. Then they were in profound darkness, and as it was no part of the policy of Sir Richard Blunt to run any unnecessary risks, he did not move one inch from the place upon which he stood until he had lighted a small hand lantern, which had a powerful reflector and a tin shade, which in a moment could be passed over the glass, so as to hide the light upon an emergency. \"Now, Crotchet,\" he said, \"we shall see where we are.\" \"Reether,\" said Crotchet. By holding the light some height up, they were able to command a good view of the attic. It was a miserable looking room: the walls were in a state of premature decay, and in several places lumps of mortar had fallen from the ceiling, making a litter of broken plaster upon the floor. It was entirely destitute of furniture, with the exception of an old stump bedstead, upon which there lay what looked like a quantity of old clothes. \"Safe enough,\" said Sir Richard. \"Stop!\" said Crotchet. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" \"There\u0027s something odd on the floor here. Don\u0027t you see as the dust has got into a crevice as is bigger nor all the other crevices, and goes right along this ways and then along that ways? Don\u0027t you move, sir. I\u0027ll be down upon it in a minute.\" Mr. Crotchet laid himself down flat upon the floor, and then crept on until he came to that part of the flooring which had excited his suspicions. As soon as he pressed upon it with both his hands it gave way under them plainly, by the elevation of the other end of the three boards of which this trap was composed, proclaiming that it was a moveable portion of the floor, revolving or turning upon one of the joists as a centre. \"Oh dear, how clever!\" said Crotchet. \"If Mr. Todd goes on a cutting away his joists in this here way he\u0027ll bring his blessed old house down with a run some day. How nice and handy, now, if any one was to step upon here—they\u0027d go down into the room below, and perhaps break their blessed legs as they went.\" The Secret Trap Discovered In Todd\u0027s House. The Secret Trap Discovered In Todd\u0027s House. \"Escape the first for us!\" said Sir Richard. \"Oh, lor, yes. Now this here Todd thinks, by putting this here man-trap here, as he has perwided again any accidents; but we ain\u0027t them \u0027ere sort o\u0027 birds as is catched by chaff, not we. Why he must have spilted his blessed ceiling down below to make this here sort of a jigamaree concern.\" \"It\u0027s not a bad contrivance though, Crotchet. Its own weight, you see, restores it to its place again, and so there\u0027s no trouble with it.\" \"Oh dear, no. It\u0027s a what I calls a self-acting catch-\u0027em-who-can sort o\u0027 machine. Yes, Sir Richard, I never did think that \u0027ere Todd was wery green. He don\u0027t know quite so much as we know; but yet he\u0027s a rum \u0027un.\" \"No doubt of it. Do you think, Crotchet, there is anything else in this attic to beware of?\" \"Not likely; when he\u0027d finished this here nice little piece of handywork, I dare say he said to himself—\u0027This will catch \u0027em,\u0027 and so down stairs he toddled, and grinned like a monkey as has swallowed a whole nut by haccident, and gived himself a pain in the side in consekence. \u0027That\u0027ll catch \u0027em,\u0027 says he.\" Mr. Crotchet seemed so much amused at the picture he drew to himself of the supposed exultation of Todd, that for some moments he did nothing but laugh. The reader must not suppose, however, that in the circumstances of peril in which they were, he indulged in a regular \"Ha! ha!\"—quite the contrary. He had a mode of laughing under such circumstances that was entirely his own, and which, while it made no noise, shook his huge frame as though some commotion had taken sudden possession of it, and the most ridiculous part of the process was the alarming suddenness with which he would become preternaturally serious again. But Sir Richard Blunt knew his peculiarities, and paid no attention to them, unless they very much interfered with business. \"We must not waste time. Come on, Crotchet.\" Sir Richard walked to the door of the attic and tried it. It was as fast as though it had been part of the wall itself. \"So—so,\" he said. \"Master Todd has taken some precautions against being surprised from the top of his house. He has nailed up this door as surely as any door was ever nailed up.\" \"Has he really, though?\" \"Yes. Quick, Crotchet. You have your tools about you, I suppose.\" \"Never fear,\" said Crotchet. \"I\u0027m the indiwedal as never forgets nothink, and if I don\u0027t have the middle panel out o\u0027 this door a\u0027most as soon as look at it, it\u0027s only cos it takes more time.\" With this philosophical and indisputable remark, Mr. Crotchet stooped down before the door, and taking various exquisitely made tools from his pocket, he began to work at the door. He knocked nearly noiselessly, and it looked like something little short of magic to see how the panel was forced out of the door without any of the hammering and flustering which a carpenter would have made of it. \"All\u0027s right,\" he said. \"If we can\u0027t creep through here, we are bigger than I think we is.\" \"That will do. Hush!\" They both listened attentively, for Sir Richard thought he heard a faint noise from the lower part of the house. As, however, five minutes of attentive listening passed away, and no repetition of it occurred, they thought it was only some one of those accidental sounds which will at times be heard in all houses whether occupied or not. Crotchet took the lead by creeping clearly enough through the opening that he had made in the door of the attic, and Sir Richard followed him. They were both, now, at the head of the staircase, and Sir Richard held up the lantern so as to have a good look around him. The walls looked damp and neglected. There were two other doors opening from that landing, but neither of them was fastened, so that they entered the rooms easily. They took care, though, not to go beyond the threshold for fear of accidents, although it was very unlikely that Todd would take the trouble to construct a trap-door in any other attic than the one which was so easily accessible from the parapet. \"Old clothes—old clothes!\" said Crotchet. \"There seems to be nothing else in these rooms.\" \"So it would appear,\" said Sir Richard. He lifted up some of the topmost of a heap of garments upon the floor, and a cloud of moths flew upwards in confusion. \"There\u0027s the toggery,\" said Mr. Crotchet, \"of the smugged \u0027uns!\" \"You really think so.\" \"Knows it.\" \"Well, Crotchet, I don\u0027t think from what I know myself that we shall disagree about Todd\u0027s guilt. The grand thing is to discover how, and in what way he is guilty.\" \"Just so. I\u0027m quite sure we have seed all as there is to see up here, so suppose we toddle down stairs now, sir. There\u0027s, perhaps, quite a lot o\u0027 wonders and natur\u0027, and art, down below.\" \"Stop a bit. Hold the lamp.\" Crotchet did so, while Sir Richard took from his pocket a pair of thick linsey-woolsey stockings, and carefully drew them on over his boots, for the purpose of deadening the sound of his footsteps; and then he held the light, while Mr. Crotchet, who was similarly provided with linsey-woolseys, went through the same process. After this, they moved like spectres, so perfectly noiseless were their footsteps upon the stairs. Sir Richard went first, while Crotchet now carried the light, holding it sufficiently high that the magistrate could see the stairs before him very well, as he proceeded. It was quite evident, from the state of those stairs, as regarded undisturbed dust, that they had not been ascended for a considerable time; and indeed, Todd, considering the top of his house as perfectly safe after the precautions he had taken, did not trouble himself to visit it. Our adventurers reached the landing upon the second floor in perfect safety; and after giving a few minutes more to the precautionary measure of listening, they opened the first door that presented itself to the observation, and entered the room. They both paused in astonishment, for such a miscellaneous collection of matters as was in this room, could only have been expected to be met with in the shop of a general dealer. Several chairs and tables were loaded with wearing apparel of all kinds and conditions. The corners of the room were literally crowded with mobs of swords, walking sticks, and umbrellas; while a countless heap of hats lay upon the floor in disorder. You could not have stepped into that room for miscellaneous personal appointments of one sort or another; and Mr. Crotchet and Sir Richard Blunt trod upon the hats as they walked across the floor, from sheer inability to get out of the way. \"Well,\" said Crotchet, \"if so be as shaving should go out of fashion, Todd could set up a clothier\u0027s shop, and not want for stock to begin with.\" \"I can imagine,\" muttered the magistrate to himself, \"what a trouble and anxiety all these things must be to Todd, and woollen goods are so difficult to burn. Crotchet, select some of the swords, and look if there are maker\u0027s names upon the blades.\" While Crotchet was preparing this order. Sir Richard was making a hasty but sufficiently precise examination of the room. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276/89597.html","bookId":510,"book":{"id":510,"title":"The String of Pearls","description":"简介： The Romance of The String of Pearls having excited in the Literary world an almost unprecedented interest, it behoves the author to say a few words to his readers upon the completion of his labours....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
