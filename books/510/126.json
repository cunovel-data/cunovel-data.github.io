{"id":12098,"no":126,"title":"CHAPTER CXXIII. THE BEASTS AT THE TOWER.","content":"All good things must have an end, and Ben\u0027s lunch in the Tower was not any exception to the rule. At last even he was satisfied that nobody would eat any more, although he was very far indeed from being satisfied that they had had enough. \"Won\u0027t anybody be so good,\" he said, \"as just to try and pick a little bit of something?\" \"No—no!\" was the general response. \"Indeed, Ben,\" said Colonel Jeffery, \"if we take any more we shall positively be ill, and I\u0027m sure you don\u0027t wish that.\" \"Oh, dear, no,\" groaned Ben; \"but it\u0027s quite clear to me, of course, that you don\u0027t like the lunch, or else you could not have took it so very easy.\" With one accord upon this, everybody declared that they had liked it amazingly well. \"Then you will all try a drop more ale?\" Upon this, they rose from the table, for they had a well-grounded suspicion that if they staid any longer, Ben would try to force something down their throats, whether they would or not. \"Ah, well,\" said Ben, with a sigh, when he found that they would not be prevailed upon to take anything else. \"Then we may as well go and see the lions in the Tower.\" \"Oh, yes,\" added Johanna, \"I have heard so much of them, that I quite long to see them.\" \"Should you, my duck?\" cried Ben; \"then come along.\" Here Ben would have carried Johanna again, for somehow he had got the idea fixed in his head that the kindest thing he could possibly do as regarded Johanna was to prevent her from using her feet; but Mark Ingestrie interposed, saying— \"Ben, she would much rather walk. You forget, my kind friend, that she is no longer now a child.\" \"Oh, dear,\" said Ben, with a look of profound wisdom, \"if you come to that, we are all children. Look at me, I\u0027m only a fine baby.\" Everybody laughed at this sally of Ben\u0027s, as well they might; and then, being fully convinced that no more eating nor drinking was at all practicable, Ben proceeded to lead the way to the lions. \"Is there any danger?\" said Arabella. \"I hope you will not let any of them out of their cages, Mr. Ben.\" \"Oh, dear, no, there\u0027s no danger, and we don\u0027t let any of them out. We only pokes them up a bit with a long pole, to make \u0027em rather lively to visitors.\" \"And have no accidents ever happened?\" said Johanna. \"Lord bless you, no. To be sure one of the warders, who was rather a new hand, would put his hand in between the bars of the lion\u0027s den and get it snapped off; and once a leopard we had here broke loose, and jumped on the back of a sentinel, and half eat him up; but we haven\u0027t had any accidents.\" \"Why, what do you call them, Ben?\" \"Oh, nothing at all.\" \"I dare say,\" said Sir Richard Blunt, \"that the poor warder and the sentinel would have called those little incidents something.\" \"Well, perhaps they might,\" said Ben. \"In course people will think of themselves before anybody else; but, howsomdever, don\u0027t you be after going to be afeard, my little dears; and if any of the beasteses was to get out, always recollect that easy does it, and it\u0027s no use making a fuss.\" \"I suppose you think, Ben, that if we are to be eaten up by a lion or a leopard, there\u0027s no such thing as avoiding our fate,\" said the colonel. \"Is that your idea?\" \"Well, I hardly know,\" said Ben. \"But one day we had a young chap—a new warder—who came here out of the country, and he said he had had a dream the night before he came that he should be devoured by a wolf. Now we hadn\u0027t a wolf in the Tower collection at all, so, in course, we all laughed at him, and told him he would have to go to foreign parts to bring his dream true. But you\u0027d hardly believe it, that very day afore the young fellow had been one hour in the Tower, there comes a boat to the stairs, with an officer, and he asks to see the keeper of the beasts, and he says to him—\u0027My ship is lying at the Nore, and we have brought from Friesland one of the largest wolves as ever was known for the Tower collection,\u0027 says he, \u0027and he\u0027s in a large bag we made on purpose to hold him in the boat.\u0027 Well, when the young warder heard this he said—\u0027That\u0027s my wolf. He has come for me!\u0027 and off he set a trembling like anything. The wolf was brought in in a coal sack, and we got him into an empty den that was shut up with a chain and a staple only; but as all the fastenings were out of his reach, he could not interfere with it if he was ever so cunning. Well, night came, and we all took it easy, and went to bed; but in the middle of the night what should we hear but the most horrid howling that ever you could think of, and when we ran to the Lion Tower, where it came from, we found the iron door of the wolf\u0027s den open, and the young warder lying, half in and half out of it, stone dead. The wolf had had him by the throat.\" \"And what became of the wolf?\" said Johanna. \"He was gone, and we never so much as heard of him from that day to this.\" \"Well, Ben,\" said the colonel, \"that is a very good story of the lions in the Tower, and here we are, I think, close to them.\" A terrific roar at this moment proved the colonel\u0027s words to be tolerably true. \"Ah, they are feeding some on \u0027em,\" said Ben. \"It just the time, and they will not be convinced as easy does it.\" \"It is hard enough, Ben,\" said Sir Richard Blunt, \"to convince human beings of that piece of philosophy, to say nothing of lions and tigers.\" \"Oh, but,\" said Ben, with great gravity, \"lions and tigers is generally much more reasonable than human beings.\" Another roar from the menagerie joined in as bass to the laugh with which this piece of philosophy from so unlikely a person as Ben was received. \"Come on,\" he said; \"come on. They can make a noise, but that\u0027s just about all they can do. Come on, my little dears—and if you fell at all afeard, all you have got to do is to take hold of the lion by the nose, and then you\u0027ll find he looks upon you as one of them as takes things easy, and he won\u0027t say another word to you anyhow.\" \"We will leave that to you, Ben,\" said Johanna, \"and in the meantime, I will keep close to you, you know.\" \"Do, my little duck; and I\u0027ll just carry you.\" \"No—no—no!\" Johanna darted away; for if she had not done so, Ben would inevitably have had her up in his arms by way of showing his affection for her. It was a fixed idea of his, and was not to be shaken by any denials or remonstrances. And now in a few minutes, after traversing the highly picturesque and antique passages of the Tower, the little party arrived at where the lions were kept. The colonel gave a caution to the late ostler of the inn in Fleet Street to keep an eye over Hector, who not being accustomed to an introduction to such animals as he was about to see, might fancy himself called upon to do something out of the way upon the occasion. \"Oh, I\u0027ll watch him, sir,\" said the man. \"Come here, Pison, will you? and don\u0027t you be after going and interfering with wild beasteses. Lor bless you, sir, he\u0027ll be quite glad to see \u0027em, and will go on speaking of \u0027em for ever afterwards—I know he will.\" \"Here you are,\" said Ben, as he halted opposite the door of a lordly lion. They all looked at the immense creature with a vast amount of interest, for such creatures were rather rarities at that time in London. While our friends are thus examining the king of the forest, as he crunches a huge beef bone with his formidable jaws, we may give a brief account of the wild creatures that in old times were kept in the tower. There was Pedore, a beautiful lioness, brought from Senegal, and presented to the king by Governor V. Harora. C?sar, brother to Pedore, brought from the same place, and presented to his majesty, by Captain Haycraft. He has been in the Tower about eight months, is three years and a half old, and supposed to be the finest lion ever seen in England. His looks strike the stoutest beholder with astonishing awe. His head is large, being covered with a long shagged mane that reaches to his shoulders, and adds rather to the terror than majesty of his countenance; for his eyes being very fiery, and darting, as it were, a kind of red flame through his long, shaggy, and dishevelled hair, raises such an idea of fierceness as cannot be excited in a mind unaccompanied with fear, nor can we conceive it possible for human courage to encounter a creature of such a dreadful aspect, without the intervention of some lucky circumstance, notwithstanding the stories that have been related of men killing lions in equal combat. His mouth opens wide, and discovers a frightful set of teeth; and when he roars he may be heard at a great distance. Miss Jane, a beautiful lioness, about six years old, brought from the coast of Barbary, by Sir Jacob Wyatt. Phillis, a large wolf, brought from Boulogne, in France, and presented to his majesty by Colonel Hollingworth. It is in form not unlike a dog of a mixed breed, and has been in the Tower about five years. These are very ravenous creatures, which inhabit the immense forests in France and other parts, and are a terror to men and cattle. In the severe season of the year they come from the woods and fall ravenously upon every living thing they meet, and have been known to enter houses in search of food. Sukey, a North American bear, brought over by Lord Bruce. She has been in the Tower about twelve months. Hector, a most beautiful lion, sent from the Emperor of Morocco as a present to his majesty. He is fourteen years old, and has been in the Tower about ten. He greatly resembles C?sar. Helena, companion to Hector, a very handsome lioness, and presented also by the Emperor of Morocco. Miss Gregory, a beautiful leopardess, about twenty years of age. She was sent to his late majesty by the Dey of Algiers, and presented by the late Algerine Ambassador. Sir Robert, a fine leopard, of a shining yellow colour intermixed with bright spots. He was brought from Senegal by—Touchit, Esq. He has been in his present situation about eight years, during which he has had seven young ones by two different leopardesses. The young, however, all died soon after being whelped, except one which lived about ten months. Miss Nancy, a very beautiful lioness, brought from Senegal, and presented to his majesty by — Brady, Esq. She has been here only about nine months, is not quite two years old, and seems very tractable. A lion monkey. This beast is of a black colour, with very shaggy hair. It was brought from the Cape of Good Hope, and has been here about four months. An American black bear, lately brought over by Colonel Clarke. A racoon, brought from Norway by Colonel Clarke. This is a very small beast, and exceedingly harmless. It lives on the sea-sands, and chiefly on shell fish, which it takes in a very safe and dexterous manner; for whenever the fish opens its shell to receive either air or nourishment, this creature, we are told, puts a small pebble in, so that the shell may not close again, and picks out the fish with its claws. Rose, a large Norway wolf, presented about four years since by Herr Widderman. He is about six years old, and appears very fierce and ravenous. Miss Sally, a beautiful leopardess, presented by the Emperor of Morocco, and brought over in the same ship with Hector. These were the principal inhabitants of what was called the Lion\u0027s Tower; and Ben, who was never so much in his glory as when he was describing the creatures and commenting upon them, went through the list of them with commendable accuracy. It was quite impossible but that the party should very much admire these wild inhabitants of the woods and wastes of nature, and Ben was wonderfully gratified at the fearless manner in which both Johanna and Arabella approached the dens. The inspection of the beasts lasted more than an hour, and then, as Sir Richard Blunt had no more time at his disposal, they all again proceeded to the barge that was waiting for them. Ben accompanied the party from the Tower, as the Oakleys had invited him to dine with them. \"Ah,\" he said, \"by the time we get to your house, cousin Oakley, I shall be half famished. Thank goodness! I have ordered something to eat to be put on board the barge, in case we should be sharp set.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276/89683.html","bookId":510,"book":{"id":510,"title":"The String of Pearls","description":"简介： The Romance of The String of Pearls having excited in the Literary world an almost unprecedented interest, it behoves the author to say a few words to his readers upon the completion of his labours....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
