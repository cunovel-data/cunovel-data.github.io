{"id":12071,"no":99,"title":"CHAPTER XCVI. THE BOAT ON THE RIVER.","content":"Todd did shrink aghast. This wild vehemence of Mrs. Lovett\u0027s was something that he did not expect. Every word that she uttered filled him with alarm. He began really to think that she had gone mad, and that he might have everything to dread from her wild vehemence, and that probably he had gone too far in cheating her out of the result of her labours. \"Peace,\" he said. \"Peace, and you shall be satisfied.\" \"I will be satisfied.\" \"Well, well, of course you shall. But you cannot be if you destroy both yourself and me, which your present conduct threatens.\" \"I tell you I joined with you in murder for the love of gold, and I will have my recompense. Give me that which is mine own. I will have it, or I will drag you with me to the halter. Do you understand that, Sweeney Todd? I ask you, do you understand that?\" \"It is plain enough,\" said Todd. \"Then give me my gold—gold for blood. Give it to me, and let me go.\" \"You are really so precipitate. Upon my word, Mrs. Lovett, you are quite an altered woman, that you are. I certainly never did expect to hear such language from you. Any one would think that you had an idea I meant to cheat you.\" Mrs. Lovett made an impatient gesture, but Todd continued— \"Now, anything more repugnant to my feelings than that could not possibly be, I assure you; and I consider you fully entitled to ￡22,000 8s. 3d., which is precisely your half of the proceeds of the little business.\" \"Give me the money.\" \"Now, do you suppose, Mrs. Lovett, that I am so green as to keep here in the house no less a sum than ￡22,000 8s. 3d.? You really must think I have taken leave of my senses, to dream for one moment of such a thing.\" \"Where is it, then?—where is it? I see you are bent upon driving me mad.\" \"Why, really, Mrs. L., it would be insulting you to say that you were perfectly in your right senses at this moment; but come, sit down, and we will see what can be done. Sit down, and compose yourself.\" \"In the shaving chair\" \"Ha—ha, that\u0027s a good joke. In the shaving chair! Ha—ha! No Mrs. L., I don\u0027t exactly want to polish you off. Sit down where you like, but not in the shaving chair, if you don\u0027t fancy it, Mrs. L. Pray sit down.\" \"For you to cut my throat?\" \"What?\" \"I say, for you to cut my throat? Do you think I am not sharp sighted enough to see that razor partially hidden in your sleeve? No, Todd, I am well aware that you are panting to murder me. I tell you I know it, and it is useless your making the faintest attempt to conceal it. The fact is broad and evident; but I am upon my guard, and I am armed likewise, Todd.\" \"Armed?\" \"Yes, Todd, I am armed, and you are terrified at the idea, as I knew you would be. Nothing to you is so horrible as death. You who have sent so many from the world, will yourself go from it howling with fright. I am armed, but I do not mean to tell you how.\" \"You are wrong, Mrs. Lovett. What on earth would be the use of my taking your life?\" \"You would have all then.\" \"All? What do I want with all? I am not a young man now, and all I wish is the means of enjoyment for the remainder of my days. That I can well command with a less sum than my half of that which we have to divide will come to. I have no one that I care to leave a sixpence to, and therefore what need I trouble myself to hoard? You are quite mistaken, Mrs. Lovett.\" \"Give me my money then.\" \"I will, of course; but I tell you it is at the banker\u0027s, Messrs. Grunt, Mack, Stickinton, and Fubbs. Yes, that is the name of the highly respectable firm in whose hands for the present both my money and yours is deposited; and from the high character of the house, I should say it could not possibly be in safer hands.\" \"My share will be quite safe with me, or if unsafe, you need not care. I will have it.\" \"Step into the parlour, and I will write you an order for your half, and you can get it in half an hour.\" \"No Todd. You will make the attempt to murder me if I step into the parlour. I will not even come further into your shop, than here upon the threshold of it, with the door in my hand. Why do you keep a razor concealed in your sleeve?\" \"Oh—I—It\u0027s a little habit of mine; but allow me to assure you how very incorrect your suspicions are, Mrs. Lovett; and if you will not come in, I will write the order, and bring it to you; or what do you say to my going with you to the bankers, where you can yourself ask what is the amount of the sum standing in my name there; and when you have ascertained it, you can have half of it to a sixpence.\" \"Come, then. I confess, Todd, I am sufficiently suspicious of you, that I would rather not lose sight of you.\" \"Dear me, how dreadful it is for friends to be in such a state of feeling towards each other, to be sure. But the time will come, Mrs. Lovett, when you will see my conduct in a different light, and you will smile at the suspicion which you say you now entertain, but which sometimes I cannot help thinking are not the genuine sentiments of your heart.\" \"Come—come, at once.\" \"I must wait for the boy; I cannot leave the shop until the boy is here to mind it in my absence.—Oh, here he is.\" At this moment, Johanna, who had not troubled herself to go to the market at all, came back. \"Well, what is the exact time,\" said Todd, \"by St. Dunstan\u0027s?\" \"A quarter-past eleven, sir.\" \"How very satisfactory. I am only going a little way with this lady, and will soon be back. You can keep up the fire, Charley, and in that corner you will find some religious tracts, which will I hope improve your mind. Above all things, my lad, never neglect your religious exercises. I hope you said your prayers last night, Charley?\" \"I did, sir,\" said Johanna, and she said it with a look that added the query, \"did you say your\u0027s?\" Todd hesitated a moment, as though something were passing through his mind respecting Johanna, and then he muttered to himself— \"There is time enough, yet.\" No doubt he had begun to entertain serious suspicions of Master Charley, and in those few words was alluding to his intention of taking his life before the coming night. \"Now, my dear Mrs. Lovett,\" said Todd, as he put on his hat, and pressed it down unusually over his brows, \"I am ready.\" \"And I,\" she said. Todd only glanced round the shop, to be certain that he had left everything as he wished it, and he tried the parlour door. Then he at once stalked into Fleet Street, followed by Mrs. Lovett. \"It will look better for you to take my arm,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t care how it looks,\" she replied. \"All I want is my money. Do not touch me, or you will see good cause shortly to me having done so. Go on and I will follow you; but if you attempt to escape me, I will raise the street in pursuit of you, by screaming out that you are Todd the mur—\" \"Hush—hush, woman. Do you know where you are?\" \"Yes, in the street, but I do not care. All I want is my money, and I will have it.\" \"Curses on you and your money too,\" muttered Todd, as he crossed Fleet Street, and turned up Bridge Street at a rapid pace. He passed all the turnings leading to the city, and kept on his way towards the bridge. Mrs. Lovett followed him closely. \"Stop!\" she said. \"Stop!\" Todd stopped and turned about. He was mortally afraid that she would carry out some of her threats if he exhibited anything of a restive spirit towards her. \"Whither are you going?\" she said. \"This is not the way to the City.\" \"It is by the Thames.\" \"By the Thames?\" \"Yes, I go by water; I do not wish to run the risk of meeting all sorts of people in the streets. I have not communicated to you that we are in great danger, but it is a fact. I do not now think that I shall get fairly off, but you will, if I am not interfered with before you get your money. By taking a boat at the stairs here by Blackfriars Bridge, we can be landed at a spot within about twenty yards of the banking-house, which will be by far the safer route.\" Mrs. Lovett did not much fancy the river excursion; but she considered that after all there would be a waterman in the boat, and that the river at that time of the day was populous, so she thought that Todd dared not attempt anything. \"Very well,\" she said; \"so that we are quick, I care not.\" \"I am to the full,\" said Todd, \"as anxious as you can be to get the job settled.\" Mrs. Lovett thought that there was something ominous in the way in which he pronounced the word \"job;\" but then she thought perhaps she was too critical, and she followed him to the stairs by the side of the old bridge, certainly not without suspicions, but they were only general ones. The idea struck her, however, that she should be safer with two watermen, and she said— \"We will have two men, and by so doing we shall go quicker down the stream.\" \"So we shall,\" said Todd; \"it is a good idea. Hilloa! first oars, here—first oars!\" \"Here you are, sir,\" said a waterman. \"We want a couple of you,\" said Todd. \"Yes, your honour. Here we are—me and my mate. All\u0027s right, your honour. Now, Bill, look alive.—Mind the step, ma\u0027am. That\u0027s yer sort. Where to, your honour?\" \"To Pigs Quay.\" \"Ay, ay. Give way, Bill, give way. A nice day for the water, your honour; a fine fresh air, and not too much of it. Easy, Bill.\" \"Very,\" said Todd, as he took his place beside Mrs. Lovett in the stern of the boat, which in a moment, propelled by the vigorous strokes of the two rowers, shot out into the middle of the stream. He whispered to Mrs. Lovett—\"Now, how delightful it would be if you and I, with all our money, were going from England to-day!\" \"No.\" \"No? Why, I cannot conceive anything more pleasant. Ha! ha!\" Both Todd and Mrs. Lovett were so much occupied in watching each other, that they did not perceive another boat push off from the same stairs at which they had embarked with two men in it, and which kept in their wake pretty closely. The two watermen of Todd\u0027s boat, however, saw it, and they looked at each other, but they said nothing. They went upon the wise plan, that it was no business of theirs; and so they pulled away, while Todd glanced uneasily into the pale face of Mrs. Lovett. To say that Mrs. Lovett kept an eye upon Todd, would be but faintly to express the feline-like watchfulness with which she regarded him, as they sat together in the boat. There was not the slightest movement of his eye—the least twitch of a muscle of his face, that she did not observe, and strive to draw some conclusion from; and he felt that his very soul was being looked into by that bold woman, who had been the companion of his iniquity, and whom he was now plotting and planning, by some mad desperate means, to deprive of her share of that ill-gotten wealth, which never in this world, even if ten times the amount, could make either of them happy.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276/89656.html","bookId":510,"book":{"id":510,"title":"The String of Pearls","description":"简介： The Romance of The String of Pearls having excited in the Literary world an almost unprecedented interest, it behoves the author to say a few words to his readers upon the completion of his labours....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
