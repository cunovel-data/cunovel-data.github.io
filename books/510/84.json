{"id":12056,"no":84,"title":"CHAPTER LXXXII. TODD PLANS.","content":"How she sped with Todd we are already aware. Let us take a peep at the arch-demon in that parlour, which he considered his sanctuary, his city of refuge as it were. At least Todd considered it to be such, whether it was or not. He sits at a table, the table beneath which there was no floor, and covering up his face with his huge hands, he sets about thinking. Yes, that man now abandons himself to thought, as to how he is, with a blaze of wickedness, to disappear from the scene of his iniquities. It was not remorse that now filled his brain. It was not any feeling of bitter heart-felt regret for what he had done that oppressed him now. No such feeling might possibly find a home in his heart at the hour of success, but now when he saw and felt that he was surrounded by many difficulties, it had no home in his brain. But yet he thought that they were only difficulties that now surrounded; he did not as yet dream of positive danger. He still reasoned, as you have heard him reason before, namely, that if anything beyond mere suspicion were entertained regarding his mode of life, he would be at once apprehended. He thought that somebody—most likely Colonel Jeffery—was trying to find out something, and the fact that he, Todd, was there in his own parlour, a free man, appeared to him proof-sufficient that nothing was found out. \"How fallacious!\" If he had but known that he was virtually in custody even then, as he, indeed, really was, for Fleet-street was alive with officers and the emissaries of the police. If he had but guessed so much for a moment what a wild tumult would have been raised in his brain. But he knew nothing and suspected little. After a time from generalizing upon his condition, Todd began to be particular, and then he laid down, as it were, one proposition or fact which he intended should be the groundwork of all in other proceedings. That proposition was contained in the words— \"Before the dawn of to-morrow I must be off!\" \"That\u0027s settled,\" said Todd, and he gave the table a blow with his hand. \"Yes, that\u0027s settled.\" The table creaked ominously, and Todd rose to peep into the shop to see what his boy was doing. Charley Green, alias, Johanna Oakley, was sitting upon a low stool reading a bill that some one had thrown into the shop, and which detailed the merits of some merchandize. How far away from the contents of that bill which she held before her face, were her thoughts? \"Good,\" said Todd. \"That boy, at all events, suspects nothing, and yet his death is one of the things which had better not be left to chance. He shall fall in the general way of this place. What proper feeling errand-boy would wish to survive his master\u0027s absence. Ha!\" Of late Todd had not been very profuse in his laughs, but now he came out with one quite of the old sort. The sound startled himself, and he retired to the table again. By the dim light he opened a desk and supplied himself with writing materials; the twilight was creeping on, and he could only just see. Spreading a piece of paper before him, he proceeded to make a memoranda of what he had to do. It was no bad plan this of Todd\u0027s, and the paper, when it was finished was quite a curiosity in its way. It ran thus— Mem.—To go to Colonel Jeffery\u0027s, and by some means get into the house and murder Tobias. Mem.—To pack off goods to the wharf where the Hamburg vessel, called the Dianna, sails from. Mem.—To arrange combustibles for setting fire to the house. Mem.—To cut Charley Green\u0027s throat, if any suspicion arise—if not to let him be smothered in the fire. Mem.—To have a letter ready to post to Sir Richard Blunt, the magistrate, accusing Mrs. Lovett of her own crimes, and mine likewise. \"I think that is all,\" said Todd. He folded the paper and placed it in his bosom, after which he came out of the parlour into the shop, and called to Johanna. \"Charles?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Go to the market, and get me a couple of stout porter—I want something carried a short distance.\" \"Yes, sir.\" Away went Johanna, but before she got half way down to Fleet Market she met Sir Richard, who said— \"What is it?\" \"He wants a couple of porters to carry something.\" \"Very well, get them. Depend upon me.\" \"I do, sir. I feel now in good heart to go through with anything, for you are near to me, and I know that I am safe.\" \"You are safe. It will need to be some very extraordinary circumstances, indeed, that could compromise you. But go at once for these porters; I, and my men will take good care to find where they go to.\" There was no difficulty in finding parties in abundance at the end of Fleet Market, and Johanna speedily returned, followed by two sturdy fellows. Todd had quite a smile upon his face, as he received them. \"This way,\" he said—\"This way. I hope you have been lucky to day, and have had plenty of work.\" \"No, master,\" said one, \"we haven\u0027t, I\u0027m sorry to say.\" \"Indeed,\" added Todd. \"Well, I am very glad I have a little job for you. You see these two little boxes. You can carry one each of you, and I will go with you and show you where to.\" One of the porters raised one of the boxes, and then he gave a long whistle, as he said— \"I say, master is there penny pieces or paving stones in this here, its deuced heavy, that it is.\" \"And so is this, Bill,\" said the other. \"Oh, my eyes ain\u0027t it. There must be a quarter of a pound of goose feathers in here.\" \"Ha! ha!\" said Todd, \"How funny you both are.\" \"Funny?\" \"Yes, to be sure, but come. This will put strength into you if you had none before.\" He took a bottle and glass from a cupboard, and gave each of the men a full measure of such frightfully strong spirits, that they winked again, and the tears came into their eyes, as they drank it. \"Now shoulder the little boxes, and come along,\" he said, \"and I tell you what I\u0027ll do. If you step in here in the evening, and I should happen to be at home, I\u0027ll give each of you a shave for nothing, and polish you off in such a manner, that you will recollect it as long you live.\" \"Thank you, master—thank you. We\u0027ll come.\" One of the porters helped his companion with the chest on to his back and head, and Todd then lent a helping hand with the other. \"Charley,\" he said. \"I shall be back in a quarter of an hour.\" Away he went, preceding the porter by some half dozen steps only, but yet ever and anon keeping a wary eye upon the two chests, which contained cash, and jewels, sufficient to found a little kingdom. If he got clear off with those two chests only, he felt that he would not give himself much uneasiness about what was left behind. But was Todd going to trust these two porters from out his own immediate neighbourhood, with the secret of the destination of the boxes? No. He was by far too crafty for that. After proceeding some distance, he took them round the unfrequented side of St. Paul\u0027s Church yard, and stopping suddenly at the door of a house that was to let, he said— \"This will do.\" \"In here, master.\" \"This will do. Put them down.\" The porters complied, and Todd set down upon one of the boxes, as he said— \"How much?\" \"A shilling each of us, master.\" \"There\u0027s double the money, and now be off, both of you, about your business.\" The porters were rather surprised, but as they considered themselves sufficiently paid, they made no objection, and walked off with considerable alacrity, leaving Todd, and his treasure in the street. \"Now for a coach,\" he muttered. \"Now for a coach. Here boy\"—to a ragged boy who was creeping on at some short distance. \"Earn a penny by fetching me a coach directly.\" The boy darted off, and in a very few minutes brought Todd a hackney coach. The boxes, too, were got upon it by the united efforts of Todd, the coachman, and the boy, and then, and not till then did Todd give the correct address of the wharf in Thames Street from which the Hamburg ship was going, and in which he fully intended to embark that night. The ship was advertised to sail at the turn of the tide, which would be about four o\u0027clock in the morning. All this did not take long to do. The coach rumbled along Thames Street, but Todd was not aware that Mr. Crotchet had got up behind the vehicle, but such was the fact, and when the lumbering old machine stopped at the wharf, that gentleman got down, and felt quite satisfied with the discovery he had made. \"He\u0027s a trying of it on,\" soliloquised Mr. Crotchet in the bolting line, \"but it ain\u0027t no manner of a go. He\u0027ll swing, and he can\u0027t help it, if he were to book himself to the moon, and there was a coach or a ship as went all the way, and no stoppages.\" \"Mem,\" said Todd to himself. \"To go to Colonel Jeffery\u0027s and murder Tobias—Ha!\" \"Lor!\" said the coachman, \"was that you, sir?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Why as made that horrid sort of noise.\" \"Mind your business, my friend, and tell me if you can take me quickly to Islington, for I have no time to lose.\" \"Like the wind, sir, you can go with these here osses,\" replied the coachman, \"did you ever see sich bits o\u0027 blood, sir, one on \u0027ems blind, and\u0027 t\u0027other on \u0027em is deaf, which is advantages as you don\u0027t get in one pair.\" \"Advantages?\" \"Lor bless you, yes, sir. The blind \u0027un goes unknown quick, cos you sees, sir, he thinks he\u0027s only in some dark place, and in course he wants to get out on it as soon as he can.\" \"Indeed?\" \"Yes, sir, and the deaf \u0027un, he goes quick too, cos as he hears nothink, he thinks as there never was sich a quiet place as he\u0027s go\u0027s, and he does it out o\u0027 feeling and gratitude, sir, yer sees.\" \"Be quick then, and charge your own price.\" Todd sprang into the vehicle, and stimulated by the idea of charging his own price, the coachman certainly did make the bits of blood do wonders, and in quite an incredibly short space of time, Todd found himself in the immediate neighbourhood of the Colonel\u0027s house. It was now getting dark, but that was what he wished. He dismissed the coach, and took from the angle of a wall, near at hand, a long and earnest look at the Colonel\u0027s house, and as he did so dark and hideous thoughts concerning Tobias passed through his mind. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276/89641.html","bookId":510,"book":{"id":510,"title":"The String of Pearls","description":"简介： The Romance of The String of Pearls having excited in the Literary world an almost unprecedented interest, it behoves the author to say a few words to his readers upon the completion of his labours....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
