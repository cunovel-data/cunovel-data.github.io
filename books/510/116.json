{"id":12088,"no":116,"title":"CHAPTER CXIII. THE ROUTE TO NEWGATE—MRS. LOVETT\u0027S DANGER FROM THE MOB.","content":"Mrs. Lovett, upon hearing these words, turned ghastly pale, but she did not speak. The officers looked at each other with something like dismay, and then before either of them could say another word, there arose a wild prolonged shout from without. \"Out with her—out with her! Kill her! Tear her to bits and hang her on the lamp-post in the middle of Bell Yard! Out with her! Drag her out! Hang her! hang her!\" \"The coach you say is waiting, Crotchet?\" said the officer, who had been intrusted by Sir Richard Blunt with the conduct of the whole business connected with Mrs. Lovett\u0027s capture. \"It were,\" said Crotchet, \"and that coachman ain\u0027t the sort of fellow to move on till I tell him. I knows him.\" \"Very good, then we must make a dash for it, and get her away by main force, it must be done, let the risk and the consequences be what they may, and the sooner the better, too. Come on, madam.\" \"Death—death!\" said Mrs. Lovett. \"Kill me here, some of you, kill me at once; but do not let me be torn to pieces by a savage mob. Oh, God, they yell for my blood! Save me from them, and kill me here. A knife! oh, for a knife!\" \"And a fork too, mum,\" said Crotchet; \"in course, if you wants \u0027em. I tells you what it is, Mr. Green, that there mob is just savage, and we have about as much chance of getting her down to Fleet Street with her head on her shoulders, as all of us have of flying over the blessed house tops.\" \"We must. It is our duty, and if we fail, they must kill us, which I don\u0027t think they will do. Come on.\" \"I will go with you,\" said the cook, starting up from the chair upon which he had on account of his weakness been compelled to seat himself, \"I will go with you, and implore the people to let the law take its course upon this woman.\" \"In the cupboard, in the parlour,\" said Mrs. Lovett, speaking in a strange gasping tone, \"there is a letter addressed by me to Sir Richard Blunt. It will be worth your while to save it from the mob. Let me show you where to lay your hands upon it, and if you have any wish to take a greater criminal than I, go to the shop of one Sweeney Todd, a barber, in Fleet Street. His number is sixty nine. Seize him, for he is the head of all the criminality you can possibly impute to me. Seize him, and I shall be content.\" \"The man you mention,\" said Mr. Green, \"has been in Newgate an hour nearly.\" \"Newgate?\" \"Yes. We took him first, and then attended to you.\" \"Todd—captured—in Newgate—and I in fancied security here remained wasting the previous moments upon which hung my life. Oh, fool—fool—dolt—idiot. A knife! Oh, sirs, I pray you to give me the means of instant death. What can the law do, but take my life? What have you all come here, and plotted and planned for, but to take my life? I will do it. Oh, I pray you to give me the means, and I will satisfy you and justice, and die at once.\" Another loud roar from the infuriated people without, drowned whatever the officer might have said in reply to this appeal from Mrs. Lovett, and again arose the wild shouts of— \"Out with her!—Out with her!—Hang her!—Hang the murderess!—Hang her in the yard!—Out with her!\" \"Forward!\" cried Mr. Green. \"To hesitate is only to make our situation ten times worse. Forward!\" \"Hold a bit,\" cried Crotchet, \"let me speak to the people; I knows how to humour \u0027em. Only you see if I don\u0027t get her along. Come, mum, just step this a-ways if yer pleases. Open the door, Mr. Cook, and let me out first.\" The cook opened the door, and before the mob could rush into the place, Crotchet stepped on to the threshold of the shop, and in a tremendous voice that made itself heard above all others, he cried— \"Hurrah! Hurrah!\" Nothing is easier than to throw a cry into a crowd, and to get it echoed to your heart\u0027s content; and so some couple of hundred voices now immediately cried—\"Hurrah!\" and when the vast volume of sound had died away, Crotchet in such a voice that it must have been heard in Fleet Street quite plainly, said— \"My opinion is, that Mrs. Lovett ought to be hung outright, and at once without any more bother about it.\" \"Hurrah!—Hang her!—Hang her!\" shouted the mob. \"And,\" added Crotchet, \"I propose the lamp-post at the top of Fleet Market as a nice public sort of place to do the job in. She says she won\u0027t walk, but I have a coach in Fleet Street, and we will pop her into that, and so take her along quite snug.\" \"Yes, yes,\" cried the people. \"Bring her along, that will do.\" \"Oh, will it?\" muttered Crochet to himself. \"What a precious set of ninnies you are. If I get her once in the coach, and she gets out again except to step into the stone jug, may I be hanged myself.\" \"I think you have managed it, Crotchet,\" whispered Mr. Green, \"I think that will do.\" \"To be sure it will, sir. All\u0027s right. Bless your heart, mobs is the stupidest beasts as is. You may do anything you like with them if you will only let them have their own way a little, but if so be as you trys to fight \u0027em, they is all horns and porkipines, quills and stone walls, and iron rails, they is!\" \"You are right enough, Crotchet; and now then let Smith stay here and mind the house, and shut it all up snug till the morning; when it can be thoroughly searched, and you and I and Simmons here will go with Mrs. Lovett.\" \"And I too,\" said the cook. \"We can go to Sir Richard\u0027s afterwards.\" \"So we can—so we can. Come on, now.\" \"You will deliver me up to the mob,\" screamed Mrs. Lovett. \"Mercy! Mercy! I shall be torn limb from limb. Oh, what a death! Are you men or fiends that you will condemn me to it? Mercy!—mercy!\" This sudden passion of Mrs. Lovett\u0027s was the very thing the officers would have desired, inasmuch as it materially helped to deceive the mob, and to prevent any idea upon the part of the infuriated people, that there was any collusion between the officers and Mrs. Lovett, for the purpose of getting her safely to prison. They dragged her out into Bell Yard, and then the shouts that the mob set up was truly terrific. \"Lights! Links!\" cried a voice. \"Let\u0027s show her the way!\" In a moment an oil-shop opposite to Mrs. Lovett\u0027s was plundered of a score or two of links, and being lighted with great rapidity from the solitary oil-lamp that there stood in the middle of Bell Yard, they sent a bright lurid glare upon the sea of heads, that seemed so close they might have been walked upon all the way to Fleet Street. Another shout echoed far and near, and then Crotchet took hold of one of Mrs. Lovett\u0027s arms, and Mr. Green hold of the other, and the cook and the other officers following, they all began slowly to make way through the mob. \"Let\u0027s get along with her,\" cried Crotchet. \"I have her tight. She won\u0027t get away. Some of you get a good stout rope ready, and make a noose in it. We will hang her on the lamp-post at the top of the market. Bring her along. Make way a little. Only a little!\" Mrs. Lovett shrieked as she saw the sea of angry faces before, behind, and on all sides of her. She thought that surely her last hour was come, and that a far more horrible death than any she had ever calculated upon in her worst moments of depression, was about to be hers. Her eyes were blood-shot—she bit her under lip through, and the blood poured from her mouth—she each moment that she could gather breath to do so, raised a fearful shriek, and the mob shouted and yelled, and swayed to and fro, and the links were tossed from hand to hand, flashing, and throwing around them thousands of bright sparks, and people rapidly joined the mob.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276/89673.html","bookId":510,"book":{"id":510,"title":"The String of Pearls","description":"简介： The Romance of The String of Pearls having excited in the Literary world an almost unprecedented interest, it behoves the author to say a few words to his readers upon the completion of his labours....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
