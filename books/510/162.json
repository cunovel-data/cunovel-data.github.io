TODD MAKES A VIGOROUS ATTEMPT TO REACH GRAVESEND.","content":"The servant was so profuse in her acknowledgments for the half-guinea, that she seemed as if she would never get out of the room, and Todd had to say— \"There—there, that will do. Now leave me, my good girl—that will do,\" before she, with a curtsey at every step, withdrew. \"Well,\" she said, as she went down stairs. \"If I tell misses of this, I\u0027m a Prussian. Oh, dear, I keeps it to myself and says nothing to nobody, excepting to my Thomas as is in the horse-guards. Ah, he is a nice fellow, and out o\u0027 this I\u0027ll make him a present of a most elegant watch-ribbon, that he can put a bullet at the end of, and let it hang out of his fob all as if he had a real watch in his pocket.\" \"Humph!\" said Todd. \"I have bought her good opinion cheap. It was well worth ten-and-sixpence not to have the servant watching me, with, for all I know to the contrary, eyes of suspicion—well worth it.\" It was not very often that Todd indulged himself with a cup of tea. Something stronger was commonly more congenial to his appetite; but upon this occasion, after his long sleep, the tea had upon him a most refreshing effect, and he took it with real pleasure. Mrs. Hardman, in consideration of the guinea she had received beforehand, had done him justice, as far as the quality of the tea was concerned, and he had it good. \"Well,\" he said, after his third cup, \"I did not think that there was so much virtue in a cup of tea, after all; but of a surety, I feel wonderfully refreshed at it. How the wind blows.\" The wind did, indeed, blow, for all the while that Todd was taking his tea it banged and buffeted against the window at such a rate, that it was really quite a fearful thing to listen to it. A couple of candles had been lighted and brought into the room, but the gale without soon laid hold of their little flames, and tossed them about so, that they gave but a dim and sepulchral kind of light. Todd rose again, and went to the window—again he placed his face close to the pane of glass, and shading his eyes with his hands, he looked out. A dashing rain was falling. \"They say that when the rain comes the wind moderates,\" he muttered; \"but I see no signs of that, yet, it is almost a gale already.\" At that moment there came such a gust of wind howling down the street, that Todd mechanically withdrew his head, as though it were some tangible enemy come to seek him. \"Always something to foil me here,\" he said; \"always something; but out I must go. Let it look as strange as it may, I cannot stay a night in this house, for if I were to do so, that would involve the staying a day likewise; and it would be this time to-morrow before I dared venture abroad; and who knows what awful things might happen in that space of time? No, I must go to-night. I must go to-night.\" He could not help feeling that his going out while the weather was in such a state would excite a great amount of wonder in the house; but that was a minor event in comparison to what might possibly ensue from remaining, so he put on his hat. Tap—tap! came against the panel of his door. Todd muttered an awful oath, and then said,— \"Come in.\" Mrs. Hardman entered the room. \"I hope I don\u0027t intrude upon you, sir, but I was so very anxious to know if the tea was just as you like it, sir?\" \"Oh, yes—yes. I am going out a little way, my good madam. Only a little way.\" \"Out, sir?\" \"Yes, and why not?—why not? Oh, dear me! How bad my cough is to be sure, to-night. Eugh!—eugh!\" \"Goodness gracious! my dear sir, you will not think of venturing out to-night? Oh, sir!\" \"Why not, madam?\" \"The wind, sir—the rain, sir—and the wind and the rain together, sir. Oh, dear! It isn\u0027t a night to turn out a dog in, not that I like dogs, but I beg, sir, you won\u0027t think of it. Only listen, sir. How it does blow, to be sure!\" \"Madam!\" said Todd, putting on a solemn look, \"I must go. It is my duty to go.\" \"Your duty, sir?\" \"Yes. Whenever the wind blows and the rain comes down, I put a quantity of small change in my pocket, and I go out to see what objects of distress in the streets I can relieve. It is then that I feel myself called upon in the sacred name of heavenly charity to see to the wants of my poorer fellow-creatures. It is then that I can find many a one whom I can make happy and comfortable for a brief space, at all events; and that\u0027s the way that I am always, you see, madam, with a bad cold.\" \"Generous man!\" said Mrs. Hardman, wiping her eyes with the corner of her apron. \"Not at all, madam, not at all. It is one\u0027s duty, and nothing else. I feel bound to do it. But I shall want a little something for supper. A nice boiled chicken, if you please, and you will be so good as to get it for me, madam. Take this guinea, if you please, and we can talk about the change, you know, when I want anything else, my good madam.\" \"My word!\" thought Mrs. Hardman. \"He is a wonderful lodger, for he forgets all about his change. I feel that it would only vex the poor old gentleman to remind him of it, and that I do not feel justified in doing. A-hem! yes, sir. Oh, certainly, I will get the finest chicken, sir, that can be had.\" \"Do so, madam, do so. Now I\u0027m going.\" \"Oh, Lord! there\u0027s a gust of wind!\" \"I like it—I like it.\" \"And there\u0027s a dash of rain!\" \"So much the better. Delightful, delightful, my dear madam, I shall find plenty of poor objects to relieve to-night. Under gateways, I shall find them, crouching upon door-steps, and shivering on spots where a little shelter can be found from the inclemency of the weather. This is my time to try and do a little good with that superfluous wealth which Providence has given me.\" Mrs. Hardman made no further opposition to the benevolent intentions of a lodger who continually forgot his change, and Todd fairly left the house. Little did the landlady think, while she was grasping at the guineas, that there was a reward of a thousand pounds for the apprehension of her lodger, and that it would every penny-piece of it have been duly paid to her at the Treasury, if she could but have managed to lock him in a room until the officers of justice could be sent for, to pounce upon him and load him with irons, and take him off to prison. But poor Mrs. Hardman had really no idea of how near she was to fortune; and when the street-door closed upon Todd, she little suspected that she shut out such a sum as one thousand pounds sterling along with him. \"That is managed so far,\" said Todd, as he shrank and cowed before the storm-laden gale that dashed in his face the rain, as he reached the corner of the street. There Todd paused, for a new fear came across him. It was that no waterman would venture upon the river with him on such a night; and yet after reasoning with himself a little time, he said— \"Watermen are human, and they love gold as much as any one else. After all, it only resolves itself into a question of how much I will pay.\" Full of this idea, which, in its way, was a tolerably just one, he sneaked down the Strand until he got right to Charing Cross. He had thought of going down one of the quiet streets near that place, and taking a boat there; but now he considered that he would have a much better chance by going as far as Westminster Bridge; and, accordingly, despite the rain and the wind, he made his way along Whitehall, and reached the bridge. A few watermen were lounging about at the head of the stairs. They had little enough expectation of getting a fare at such a time, and upon such a day. One of them, however, seeing Todd pause, went up to him, and spoke— \"You didn\u0027t want a boat, did you, sir?\" \"Why, yes,\" said Todd, \"I did; but, I suppose, you are all afraid to earn a couple of guineas?\" \"A couple of guineas?\" \"Yes, or three, for the matter of that; one more or less don\u0027t matter to me; but it may to you.\" \"Indeed, it does, sir. You are right enough there. But where do you want to go to sir? Up or down?\" \"To Greenwich.\" Todd thought if he mentioned Gravesend, he might frighten the man at once. \"Greenwich? Whew!\" The waterman perpetrated a long whistle; and then, shaking his head, he said—\"I\u0027m very much afraid, sir, that it isn\u0027t a question of guineas that will settle that; but I will speak to my mate. Halloa Jack!—Jack! I say, old boy, where are you?\" \"Here you are,\" said an old weather-beaten man coming up the steps. \"I\u0027ve only been making the little craft fast. What is the row now, Harry—eh?\" \"No row, old mate; but this here gentleman offers a matter of three guineas for a cruise to Greenwich.\" \"Ay, and why not, Harry?\" \"Why not? Don\u0027t you hear how it\u0027s blowing?\" \"Yes, I do, Harry; but it won\u0027t blow long. I\u0027ve seen more gales than you have, lad, and I tell you that this one is all but over. The rain, in another quarter of an hour, will beat it all down. It\u0027s fast going now. It will be a wet night, and a dark night; but it won\u0027t blow, nor it won\u0027t be cold.\" \"If you say as much as that, Jack,\" said the younger waterman, \"I will swear to it.\" The old man smiled, as he added— \"Ah, dear me, yes, and so you may, Harry. I haven\u0027t been so long out of doors that I don\u0027t know the fancies of the weather. I can tell you a\u0027most what it\u0027s a going to do beforehand, better than it knows itself. There, don\u0027t you hear how it\u0027s coming in puffs, now, the wind, and each one is a bit fainter nor the one as comed afore it? Lord bless you, it\u0027s nothing! We shall get a wet jacket, that\u0027s all; and if so be, sir, as you really do want a cruise down to Greenwich, come on, and Harry and me will soon manage it for you.\" These words were very satisfactory to Todd. He had no objection in the world to its being rather a bad night on the river; but he certainly had a great objection to risking his life. Discomfort was a thing that gave him no concern. He knew well that that would pass away. \"If you are willing,\" he said, \"let us, then, start at once, and I will not hold you to your bargain if the weather should happen to turn very bad. We can, in such a case, easily, I dare say, put in at some of the numerous stairs on one side or other of the river.\" \"There will be no need of that, sir,\" said the old waterman. \"If you go, and if you choose to go all the way, we will put you on shore at Greenwich.\" \"How about London Bridge?\" said the younger man, in a tone of some anxiety. \"Better than usual,\" said Jack. \"It is just the time to shoot it nicely, for the tide will be at a point, and won\u0027t know exactly whether to go one way or the other.\" \"It\u0027s all right, then?\" \"It is.\" Todd himself had had his suspicions that the passage of old London Bridge would be one of no ordinary difficulty on such a night as that, but he knew that if the tide was at that point which the old man mentioned, that it might be passed with the most perfect safety, and it was a matter of no small gratification to him to hear from such a competent authority that such was the fact just then. \"Let us go at once,\" he said. \"All\u0027s right, sir. Our wherry is just at the foot of the stairs, here. I will pull her in, Harry.\" The old man ran down the slippery stairs with the activity of a boy, and as Todd and Harry followed him, the latter said, in quite a confidential tone of voice— Todd Encounters Great Perils On The River Thames. Todd Encounters Great Perils On The River Thames. \"Ah, sir, you may trust to his judgment on anything that has anything to do with the river.\" \"I am glad to hear it.\" \"Yes, sir, and so am I. Now I thought I knew something, and I shouldn\u0027t have ventured to take you, or if I had, it would have been with rather a faint heart; but now that the old man, sir, says it\u0027s all right, I feel as comfortable as needs be in the matter.\" By this time they had reached the foot of the steps, which was being laved by the tide, and there the old man had the boat safely in hand. \"Now for it, sir,\" he said. \"Jump in.\" Todd did so, and the younger waterman followed him. He and his aged companion immediately took their places, and Todd stretched himself in the stern of the little craft. The rain now came down in absolute torrents as the boat was pushed off by the two watermen into the middle of the stream.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276/89719.html","bookId":510,"book":{"id":510,"title":"The String of Pearls","description":"简介： The Romance of The String of Pearls having excited in the Literary world an almost unprecedented interest, it behoves the author to say a few words to his readers upon the completion of his labours....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
