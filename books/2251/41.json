{"id":86117,"no":41,"title":"Page 41","content":"\"Matthew!\" said John Five, with as wide and free a smile as Matthew had ever seen on his friend\u0027s face. \"Good mornin\u0027! aren\u0027t you the dressed-up peacock today!\" Then John\u0027s smile fell a hitch, for Matthew knew his lack of sleep on the packet boat last night showed in dark hollows beneath his eyes and a gray countenance to his flesh. \"Good morning.\" Matthew had only just left the packet boat, and was still wearing his dark blue suit, waistcoat, and tricorn and toting his valise. He\u0027d come directly here to Master Ross\u0027 blacksmithery. In the seething heat of the forge, sparks spat and the coals glowed bright orange. John had been bending lengths of iron into pothooks on his anvil with the hammer, while the second apprentice and Master Ross were speaking to another customer across the smoke-hazed shop. \"a few minutesi\" Matthew asked. \"Master Rossi\" John called, and the elder blacksmith saw Matthew standing there and said in a crusty growl, \"Don\u0027t you ever worki\" \"Yes sir, I do my share.\" \"I doubt that very much, sir. Go on then, the both of you! Three minutes, John!\" Three minutes might not be enough, Matthew thought, but he would have to take what he could. Outside, in the bright warm sunshine of Thursday morning, John squinted and clapped Matthew hard on the shoulder. \"My thanks to you. I don\u0027t know what you did, but I think you must have had a part in the reverend\u0027s speech on Sunday. Where were youi\" \"Working,\" Matthew answered. \"On Sundayi I wouldn\u0027t let the reverend hear that, if I were you. But listen, he told us the whole story on Friday night. as much as Constance and I were knocked down to find it out, we were just as relieved. I mean...havin\u0027 a sick daughter who\u0027s led such a life as that is one thing, but at least Reverend Wade\u0027s not out of his mind. Not anymore, that is.\" \"I\u0027m glad to hear it.\" \"It took courage for him to get up there and lay it all out. It\u0027s still takin\u0027 courage, for him to go in and see her like he\u0027s done. You know, yesterday mornin\u0027 he took Constance. She wanted to see her sister, and she wasn\u0027t gonna be denied.\" \"I hope that went well.\" \"It did. I reckon. She hasn\u0027t talked much about it.\" John rubbed the back of his neck, as if working a muscle the hammer and anvil had perplexed. \"I mean, nobody\u0027s happy about where Grace is, and why she wants to stay there. She won\u0027t leave it, you know. But I guess everything\u0027ll take care of itself in time, just like the reverend said. I know he\u0027s got a fight on his hands with some of those elders, though.\" \"But not all of them, I\u0027m sure,\" Matthew said. \"No, not all, that\u0027s true.\" John cocked his head to one side. \"I\u0027d like to ask you what you knew about Grace, and when you knew it, but would you tell mei\" \"I would not.\" \"Didn\u0027t think so. Doesn\u0027t matter, does iti\" \"I\u0027d like to talk about something that does matter,\" Matthew said, and his somber tone of voice made John Five draw up a frown. \"about the orphanage, to be exact.\" \"The orphanagei Oh, Matthew! He\u0027s dead now. Can\u0027t you ever let it goi\" \"It\u0027s not that. I left the orphanage in 1694, when I was fifteen. You were brought there by a parson, I recall, when you were about nine years old, and you stayed until you turned seventeen and Master Ross chose you as an apprentice. Is that correcti\" \"Yes. What of iti\" \"In the years from, say, 1696 to when you left, can you think of anything unusual happening therei\" \"Unusual,\" John repeated, with no emotion. Then he said heatedly, \"Listen, Matthew, you\u0027ve got to give this up! Forget the damned place! It\u0027s not doin\u0027 you a bit a\u0027 good to-\" \"anything unusual,\" Matthew plowed on, his eyes intense and perhaps a little haunted. \"I\u0027m not talking about ausley\u0027s personal habits now. I\u0027m talking about something that would have required boys to leave the orphanage before they were placed with families or offered apprenticeships. Maybe some left and came back, I don\u0027t know.\" He could tell John wasn\u0027t even trying to remember, probably because John\u0027s own experience at the hands of ausley wouldn\u0027t let him go back to that terrible place even in his memory. \"Please, John. Think. Something that drew the boys away from the orphanage. Maybe you even went.\" \"Oh. That,\" said John, who breathed a sigh of fresh relief. \"That was nothin\u0027. I wanted to go, but I didn\u0027t have any skills they were needin\u0027.\" \"Skillsi What kind of skillsi\" John shrugged his heavy-set shoulders. \"Readin\u0027 and writin\u0027. Figurin\u0027 numbers. Copyin\u0027 drawin\u0027s and such. You remember Seth Barnwelli He went and came back. Said they got up in his face too much. Ran the place like an army camp. Seth wasn\u0027t there but a few days. He went to learn how to make keys, but the hell of it was that for some reason they took a lot of fellas who liked to fight and cause mischief and after Seth got his nose busted a couple of times he\u0027d had enough.\" \"What was this placei\" \"It was a trade school,\" John said. a trade school, Matthew thought grimly. Indeed. \"Was it up the river about fifteen milesi\" \"I think so, yes. But like I said, I never went. One of my best friends went and stayed, though. You remember Billy Hodgesi That long tall drink of wateri He was two or three years younger than you, I guess.\" \"I remember him.\" Hodges had been a smart young man, but had always been plotting intricate ways to escape the orphanage and had great dreams of being a sea captain and sailing to the West Indies. \"He applied, and they took him. You know what they took him in fori Because he had such good handwritin\u0027. Can you believe iti They wanted him so he could learn to be a scrivener. Keep records and such, they told him. and him with that missin\u0027 thumb.\" Matthew felt a cold shock slowly course through him. He thought his face had gone from gray to pasty-white in an instant. \"Missing thumbi\" he heard himself ask. \"That\u0027s right. a year after you left, Billy was puttin\u0027 on his shoes one day when a spider bit his left thumb. Thing was in his shoe. I saw it, wasn\u0027t so big but it was awful black. Next thing, his thumb\u0027s turned blue and swelled up and his whole hand\u0027s killin\u0027 him. It went on for a while like that, brought him to tears and he was a tough nut, too. anyway, by the time ausley brought a doctor, Billy\u0027s thumb was as black as the spider. Took it off, so he wouldn\u0027t lose the whole hand. He was all right about it, though. I think he was prouder of showin\u0027 off the stump than he\u0027d been of havin\u0027 a thumb.\" \"Good thing it wasn\u0027t his scrivening hand,\" Matthew said. John grinned. \"See, that\u0027s the thing. It was his writin\u0027 hand. He had to learn to write all over again with his right hand. Maybe that helped when he had to copy the script.\" \"Copy the scripti What scripti\" \"Oh, some men would come now and again and give us tests. You know. Doin\u0027 numbers, copyin\u0027 script, figurin\u0027 out puzzles and such. They talked to us, too. Wantin\u0027 to know all about us and our lives and so on. What we wanted for the future. Were we sad, were we angry, did we carry grudges or get in fights. a man even came a couple of times to see if any of the older boys knew how to use a sword or a dagger. He was a Prussian fella, could hardly speak English. But he could handle a sword in both hands.\" The enigmatic Count Dahlgren, Matthew thought. Not teaching Chapel how to use a sword, but instead teaching younger and more pliable students. \"Whatever use would you have for a sword or dagger at a trade schooli\" he asked. \"One of the trades was learnin\u0027 how to sharpen swords and knives. I reckon they wanted somebody who showed an interest in blades.\" Master Ross suddenly peered out through the entryway, and he looked none too happy. \"Mr. Five, are you comin\u0027 back to your labors anytime todayi\" \"Oh, yes sir. Sorry.\" When the smith had gone back in, John said, \"I\u0027ve got to go. But why all this interest in the trade schooli I\u0027d nearly forgotten about it.\" \"I think it was more than a trade school,\" Matthew replied. \"More than a trade schooli Meanin\u0027 whati\" \"Mr. Five!\" came the bellow from within. John winced. \"Ouch. Well, his bark\u0027s worse than his bite. Usually. You ought to have dinner with Constance and me one evenin\u0027, Matthew. We\u0027ll talk then. all righti\" Before Matthew could respond, John Five had returned to his work. He stood in the strong white sunlight. People moved about him as if he were a rock in the midst of a stream. He was thinking that Billy Hodges was now lying in a grave on John Ormond\u0027s farm, and the young man\u0027s last journey had not been as a sea captain but as a passenger of the river. Matthew couldn\u0027t help but wonder if Hodges, the plotter of daring escapes, hadn\u0027t tried to escape the trade school, and thus brought down upon himself the judgment of the gauntlet. He had his own work to do, and best get to it. He hurried back to Grigsby\u0027s house by the shortest route, which was along the dockside, and found the printmaster setting out type for the next Earwig. Berry was absent. Grigsby told Matthew she\u0027d gone out at first light to continue her landscape pictures, and then he wanted to know all about Matthew\u0027s trip to Philadelphia and if he\u0027d met with success. \"Not just now, Marmy,\" Matthew said. \"Do you think Berry would mind if I get something from her drawersi\" Grigsby\u0027s eyes nearly popped. \"Excuse mei\" \"I mean her chest-of-drawers!\" Matthew\u0027s face was red. \"Something I asked her to keep for me.\" \"I have no opinion, it\u0027s just my house. It\u0027s apparent you and Berry are keeping secrets from me, so go right ahead and-\" But he was mouthing to the air, for Matthew had already gone to open the bottom drawer and retrieve the notebook. Matthew put the notebook in the inside pocket of his coat. He didn\u0027t have a far distance to go, and then it was a short walk to City Hall and Lillehorne\u0027s office. Chapel\u0027s cohorts might indeed be watching him, but on this day the law would also lay eyes upon Simon Chapel. \"Back later,\" Matthew told Grigsby as he went out the door. \"Go on, and don\u0027t bother telling me anything!\" Grigsby called after him, a smear of old ink already leaped across his forehead. \"I\u0027m just the broadsheet publisher!\" Matthew considered stopping at Number Seven Stone Street to see if Hudson Greathouse was available for...what would be the wordi...back-up, but as he reached the Broad Way and turned south he decided against it. No, this was a more delicate issue. There was a time for flashing swords but also a time for the quiet movement of chess pieces. He turned left onto Wall Street, passing City Hall, and then right on Broad Street. Between Barrack and Beaver, he went up three front steps to a door with a brass knocker, proclaimed himself like the hand of justice, and waited beneath the sign that read Pollard, Fitzgerald, and Kippering, attorneys. The door opened within a few seconds and a pallid-faced man with thinning brown hair and thick-lensed spectacles peered out, as if uncomfortable with the light of day. Matthew had always thought Bryan Fitzgerald looked like a mole. \"Good morning,\" the lawyer said. across his chest he held a sheaf of papers that had obviously just been pulled from a file cabinet. His shirt was marred by a small inkstain and his fingernails were chewed to the quick. He might be the one who did all the work and was well paid for it, Matthew recalled the widow Sherwyn saying, but Fitzgerald was probably more mule than mole. Fitzgerald adjusted his glasses. \"Mr. Corbett, isn\u0027t iti\" \"Yes sir. May I come ini\" \"Of course.\" He stepped back as Matthew entered and then closed the door, again as if sunlight and fresh air were the enemies to solid Puritan productivity. \"How may I help youi\" \"I was actually hoping to see Mr. Kippering today. Is he in yeti\" \"Well...he\u0027s...\" Fitzgerald cast a glance up the narrow stairs. Then he whispered, \"I don\u0027t think he went home last night.\" \"Ohi\" \"Yes. He\u0027s...well, I\u0027m not sure he\u0027s able to see a client this morning. Mr. Pollard should be back any minute. Would you care to wait for himi\" \"I won\u0027t take very long.\" Matthew withdrew the notebook from his coat. \"May I give this to Mr. Kipperingi\" Fitzgerald reached out for it. \"I\u0027ll be glad to make sure he-\" \"No, thank you,\" Matthew said firmly, and gripped his fingers tight. \"This is something I think he\u0027d wish to see for-\" \"Myself,\" said the man who had come out of his office at the height of the stairs. \"Yes sir,\" Matthew answered him, with a steady and fearless gaze. \"as I\u0027d hoped.\" Kippering did not move. He had one hand pressed against the wall beside him and the other clutching the decorative carved pineapple that topped the staircase railing. His face was masked by shadow. He wore black breeches that were shiny at the knees and the white of his stockings had faded to yellow as had his shirt. His sleeves were rolled up, but Matthew was certain it was not to welcome the energy of the day but to keep his cuffs from mopping up spilled liquor by night. Matthew figured there was a bottle or two up there, and plenty of dead ones tucked away. Kippering had killed a few of them last night, it appeared, for now he began to come slowly and unsteadily down the stairs, holding on to that railing like a lifeline. \"Bryan,\" he said in a creaky, tired voice, \"will you do me a great favori\" \"Yes, andrewi\" \"I haven\u0027t had breakfast. Would you be so kind as to fetch me something from Sally almond\u0027si\" and then the light from a small oval window above the door caught Kippering\u0027s face, and Matthew had to draw a breath because he felt as if he\u0027d been punched in the ribs. The young man who was in such a hurry to kill himself appeared at least three-quarters arrived at the graveyard. It had been over a week since Matthew had last seen him, but how could a human being have become so aged and infirm in such little timei Kippering was slope-shouldered and unkempt, his black hair oily and uncombed and the icy blue eyes now only so much cold and murky water. His face, once wolfishly handsome, now seemed only starved. The lines had deepened and the hollows darkened and his jaw was burdened with a beard that might have broken a razor. He looked twenty-eight years old and a century. Matthew was shocked to see that there was even the slight shaking of palsy to Kippering\u0027s head. \"What is todayi\" Kippering frowned, seeking the answer in a brain that may have begun to mold. \"Thursdayi ah, then.\" He attempted a smile that was no less than horrid. \"The raisin cakes will be fresh this morning. Would you go get me two of them, Bryani\" \"I\u0027m gathering the papers for Captain Topping\u0027s case,\" Fitzgerald protested, but with a weak spirit. \"Joplin will be back soon, and I\u0027m supposed to have everything-\" \"Shhhhhh,\" Kippering whispered. \"It\u0027s all right, Bryan. Really it is. Go to Sally almond\u0027s while I speak to Mr. Corbett, won\u0027t youi and here.\" He reached into his pocket and brought forth some coins, which he pressed into his partner\u0027s palm. \"Get yourself a raisin cake, and Joplin one as well. Then do me one more favor.\" \"another favori\" \"Yes, please. While you\u0027re out, go over to see Mr. Garrow at his shop on Duke Street. You know the onei\" \"I do. The horn merchant.\" \"Yes, and tell him I\u0027m still waiting for the papers he\u0027s supposed to have sent me on Monday. Would you do thati It\u0027s very important.\" \"I\u0027m very busy myself,\" said Fitzgerald, though the subdued way he spoke it and the fact that he avoided eye contact told Matthew the issue was settled. \"all right, then,\" he sighed, \"if it\u0027s so important.\" He trundled into what must have been his own office, a little broomcloset of a space that was nevertheless as neat as a hangman\u0027s noose, and unloaded his papers upon a scarred and battered desk that might have been a refugee from Grigsby\u0027s dairyhouse. Without another word except an exhalation of breath that spoke volumes for the endurance of downtrodden mules, Fitzgerald went to the door, opened it, and paused on the threshold against the morning glare. \"Did you say you wanted two cakes, andrewi\" \"Yes, Bryan. Two.\" Fitzgerald closed the door, and Matthew was alone with a walking corpse. Neither spoke. Then Kippering said, \"Don\u0027t you want to keep the door open, Matthewi\" \"No, sir. I don\u0027t think that\u0027s necessary.\" \"as long as you\u0027re sure.\" \"I do want,\" Matthew said, finding it difficult to look into the man\u0027s haggard face, \"to see something in the cellar.\" \"all right, then. Shall I lead the way, or youi\" \"If you\u0027ll lead, pleasei\" \"Of course.\" another quick death\u0027s-head smile, and Kippering walked past Matthew to the table on which sat a candle in a pewter holder next to an ivory tinderbox. He got the wick lit, opened the door to the cellar, and descended into the dark on the set of rickety stairs.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-queen-of-bedlam-matthew-corbett-2/page-41.html","bookId":2251,"book":{"id":2251,"title":"The Queen of Bedlam (Matthew Corbett #2)","description":"Storyline: The Queen of Bedlam (Matthew Corbett #2) The unsolved murder of a respected doctor has sent ripples of fear throughout a city teeming with life and noise and commerce.
