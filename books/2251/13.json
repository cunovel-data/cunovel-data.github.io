{"id":86089,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"It was unfortunate that Magistrate Powers had consented for Matthew\u0027s appointment with Mrs. Herrald, for on going to the magistrate\u0027s office on Thursday morning Matthew was unable to hold a quill steady enough to write a single line. The magistrate wanted to know everything that had happened and Matthew obliged him, accentuating the midnight rapier \"training\" that caused him now to be so useless to the cause of scribing.\\n\\n \"Off with you, then,\" Powers advised. \"I\u0027ll poach another clerk. You go home and rest.\"\\n\\n \"I think I\u0027ll stop by the apothecary for some liniment,\" Matthew said, rubbing his shoulder. \"I\u0027ll be ready for the Knox hearing tomorrow morning, though.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not so sure of that. I don\u0027t think Magistrate Mackfinay has anything on his docket. I\u0027ll ask if I might borrow his clerk.\" Powers waved him out the door. \"You just rest your arm.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you, sir. I will try to do my job tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"If not, not. Don\u0027t worry yourself about it.\" He looked at Matthew appreciatively. \"I\u0027m pleased I could help you start on a new course. Your being chosen by Mrs. Herrald for this position shines just as much a light on me as it does on you. and I\u0027m certain she\u0027ll get her money\u0027s worth. They are going to pay you well, aren\u0027t theyi\"\\n\\n \"We haven\u0027t actually talked about the figures.\"\\n\\n \"Seems to me you may need a bit of legal representation yourself. If you want a proper contract drawn up, I\u0027ll be glad to advise.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you.\" Matthew was about to leave, but he hesitated at the door.\\n\\n \"Something elsei\" Powers looked up from his papers.\\n\\n \"Yes sir. I was wondering about Mrs. Herrald. Do you know anything more about heri\"\\n\\n \"Such asi\"\\n\\n \"You mentioned that you both shared enemies. May I ask what you meant by thati\"\\n\\n The magistrate spent a moment inspecting-or at least pretending to inspect-the first few lines of the letter atop his stack of correspondence. \"Mrs. Herrald didn\u0027t inform youi\" he asked. \"Of her historyi\"\\n\\n \"She told me her husband began the agency. I understood that he is deceased. Is there something more I should knowi\" It came to him then. \"ah. You and Mrs. Herrald knew each other in London. That\u0027s why she sent the messenger. Was the messenger Mr. Greathousei\"\\n\\n \"It was Hudson, yes.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re on the basis of first names with himi That\u0027s an impressive feat. I assume you had some dealings with Mrs. Herrald, theni\"\\n\\n The magistrate summoned up a crooked smile. \"Now I see what it\u0027s like to be on the witness stand. Shall I plead guilty and throw myself on the mercy of the court, Mr. Prosecutori\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, sir.\" Matthew had to smile as well, more to hide his embarrassment than to display humor. \"I do get carried away.\"\\n\\n \"So I constantly note. To answer, I did know Katherine Herrald in London. I met her when Rich brought her to a Saturday supper at the fraternity.\"\\n\\n \"Richi\"\\n\\n \"Richard Herrald. He was a member of my law fraternity at Cambridge. Damned good tennis player, too. almost as good as myself. and he became an excellent lawyer, specializing in criminal prosecution for the city. Yes, he brought that beautiful Katherine Taylor to the Saturday supper and afterward all the lot of us put down bets as to when they\u0027d be married. I lost, but not by much.\"\\n\\n \"What happened to Mr. Herraldi\"\\n\\n again, the magistrate focused false attention on his papers. Matthew knew there was definitely something he wished to say, but perhaps decorum forbade it. \"I think,\" Powers said at last, \"that Mrs. Herrald should answer your question.\"\\n\\n \"But the part about the \u0027shared enemies,\u0027\" Matthew persisted. \"Shouldn\u0027t you answer that onei\" He remembered to give due respect. \"Sir.\"\\n\\n \"I should,\" Powers agreed. He said nothing more for a moment, staring into space. Then: \"But my answer hinges upon Mrs. Herrald\u0027s, and so I leave it to her.\"\\n\\n \"Sir, I\u0027m not asking for a legal decree. I\u0027m asking only for-\"\\n\\n \"If you\u0027re not out of this office in five seconds,\" Powers said, \"I should think your mouth could dictate these letters to the quill of Mackfinay\u0027s clerk. So are you going, or are you stayingi\"\\n\\n \"Going.\"\\n\\n \"Then be gone.\"\\n\\n The door closed at Matthew\u0027s back.\\n\\n On the way out he nearly ran into Chief Prosecutor Bynes once again, so he had to hold his progress until the man had descended the stairs. Then he went down and walked into the bright midmorning sunlight. With an eye in the back of his head he entered the stream of citizens coming and going, ducked around a haywagon and started up Smith Street for the apothecary.\\n\\n Matthew couldn\u0027t help but linger under the apothecary\u0027s red-striped awning and again examine the ground where Deverick had fallen. He\u0027d found nothing yesterday, and today found the same. So it was into the apothecary, with its counter behind which were shelves of elixir bottles, heartburn chalk, various tree barks to treat fevers, calamine lotion, leech jars, dental powder, crushed flowers and herbs, medicinal vinegars and the like, and after a short time of speaking to Mr. Oosterhout he came back onto the street with a small paper-wrapped vial of yarrow oil which he was to apply twice a day. He turned right at the intersection of Smith and King, which took him unfortunately past Eben ausley\u0027s domain-which to him looked no kinder by sun than by the dark of the moon-and to the printmaster\u0027s shop.\\n\\n Soon he was in the company of Marmaduke Grigsby, who already had been scribing articles and from them arranging the small blocks of metal typeface in their sticks. The device of note, at the center of the most sun-illuminated room, was a bulky old monster that might have been used by the hand of Gutenberg himself. Looking at such a contraption, it was hard to believe it was the medium by which parchment sheets pressed with lamp-black and linseed varnish ink went out announcing events and proclaiming news to the citizens.\\n\\n \"Come to help with the type, I hopei\" Grigsby asked. \"Then if all goes well we can get to the pressing tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"I have this.\" Matthew gave him the envelope, and waited as it was opened.\\n\\n Grigsby read it carefully. \"The Herrald agencyi Letters of inquiry to go to the Dock House Inni What\u0027s this abouti\"\\n\\n \"For you, money.\" Matthew opened his wallet and offered one of the remaining silvers. \"Will that do for a one-time announcementi\"\\n\\n \"Of course!\" Grigsby examined the coin so closely Matthew thought he was going to eat it. \"What\u0027s this in the notice, thoughi \u0027Problem-solving\u0027i What kind of problemsi\"\\n\\n \"Just run the notice as it is, if you please. I\u0027m sure it will speak for itself to those who have an interest.\"\\n\\n \"all right, then. Now come sit down at the desk and let me get some fresh paper. I want to hear your story of how you came to find Deverick\u0027s body.\" Grigsby held up a hand before Matthew could protest. \"I know you weren\u0027t first on the scene, but my interview with Phillip Covey was less than substantial. I want to know your impressions of the moment, and what McCaggers told you about the Masker. Come, come! Sit down!\"\\n\\n as Matthew took a seat in the cane-backed chair, he was fitfully aware of McCaggers advising him to guard his information and of Bynes\u0027 more forceful advice at City Hall. He waited until the printmaster was ready with a dipped quill, and then he said, \"I can give you my impressions of the moment true enough, but I have to refrain from repeating anything told me by the coroner.\"\\n\\n Grigsby\u0027s thick white eyebrows began to convulse. \"Oh no, Matthew! Not you, as well!\"\\n\\n \"Me as well whati\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not turning against me, are youi Hiding information that Lillehorne wants kept from public viewi Or is it Magistrate Powers who\u0027s choked your chaini\"\\n\\n Matthew shook his head. \"You know me better than that. McCaggers simply pointed out that it might not be in the best interest of the investigation to divulge any more about the Masker.\"\\n\\n \"ah!\" Grigsby leaned over the paper. \"Then he did use the name againi\"\\n\\n \"I believe he made it clear he thinks the killer of both men is one and the same.\"\\n\\n \"Then Masker it is!\" said Grigsby, spraying spittle upon the paper as he began to scribe with a fury only a writer might know.\\n\\n Matthew winced, hearing in his mind the awesome thunder that would break from Bynes\u0027 mouth when the chief prosecutor read this article. \"McCaggers didn\u0027t use that term, exactly. I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s wise to-\"\\n\\n \"Nonsense!\" came the quick, clipped retort. \"The Gazette would use it, and if it\u0027s good enough for the Gazette, it\u0027s good enough for the Earwig!\" He dipped his quill again. \"Now, let\u0027s have your story from the beginning.\"\\n\\n an hour later, Matthew left the printmaster\u0027s shop so worn down by Grigsby\u0027s constant grinding that, being as fuddled as he was from his poor night\u0027s sleep, he wasn\u0027t sure what he\u0027d told the man or what he\u0027d kept secret. Grigsby could take a one-sentence comment and craft a paragraph out of it. Matthew had had to beg off helping any further, due not so much to a pain in his shoulder as to a pain in the neck, and Grigsby had been disappointed but had vowed to get Effrem Owles to help with the pressing on Friday.\\n\\n Matthew walked home, was impressed by Hiram Stokely to sweep the pottery, and, as he felt it his duty to work for his lodging, he did the sweeping vigorously and without complaint. His labor was at first more strenuous than it might have been, for he had to continually dodge Cecily\u0027s snorting round-rosies and snout-shoves to his knees until Stokely had mercy on him and put the pig outside. at last Matthew was done and declared his intention to retire to his loft and catch a nap, though his progress up the ladder to the trapdoor was momentarily delayed while he assured the potter he wasn\u0027t ill and did not need a doctor.\\n\\n In his room, Matthew opened the window to allow the warm air exit, took off his coat and shirt, and applied yarrow oil to his right forearm and shoulder. Even thinking about what he was going to have to do on Saturday wore him out. He was a mental spirit, not a sportsman or swordsman. It was ridiculous, to have to go through such labors that would never suit him were he to practice with a rapier ten hours a day for a month. How did anyone ever learn to use a weapon like that, anywayi They had to start off with arms and constitutions like iron.\\n\\n I think you\u0027ve let yourself go to rot, Hudson Greathouse had said.\\n\\n Little did he know, Matthew thought. anyone could handle a sword if they were six-foot-three and constructed like a warship. and a pistol could be aimed by any idiot, so what was the pointi\\n\\n You\u0027re more a ghost than a man.\\n\\n Strong words from a weak mind, Matthew thought. Well, damn him! Ordering people around like a sandpit general! Damn him to blazes!\\n\\n Matthew lay on his bed and closed his eyes, but even so his fit of anger would not be stilled. Gone out there all that way, just to be tricked. Tried to make a fool out of me. But they didn\u0027t do a very good job of that, did theyi No siree! It takes a smarter pair than those two to make a fool of Matthew Corbett! Now this \"training\" business, trying to test my mettle! Trying to make me do something I\u0027ve never done before and likely can never do. Sword-fighting and fist-fighting and acting like a common lout! If I\u0027d wanted to spend my life wallowing in violence I could\u0027ve stayed an orphan with the harbor gangs!\\n\\n He had a clear vision of Katherine Herrald, seated behind her desk. Fixing him with those keen blue eyes like lamps shining underwater.\\n\\n Many times you will fail, she said. That is the nature of the world, and the truth of life. But when you find your horse again, will you go back, or will you go forwardi\\n\\n and then she lifted her hand from the desk, made a fist, and knocked down upon the wood. Once...twice...a third time...\\n\\n \"Matthewi Matthewi\"\\n\\n He sat up with a start, realizing how dramatically the light had faded.\\n\\n again came three knocks. \"Matthewi Open up, please!\"\\n\\n It was Hiram Stokely\u0027s voice. He was up on the ladder, knocking at the underside of the trapdoor. \"Matthewi\"\\n\\n \"Yes sir! Just a minute!\" Matthew got his feet on the floor and rubbed his eyes. He was feeling much better now, but what time was iti His watch was in his coat pocket. By the fading light he thought it must be near five o\u0027clock. He pulled open the trapdoor and looked down into Stokely\u0027s face.\\n\\n \"Sorry to bother you,\" Stokely apologized, \"but you have a visitor.\"\\n\\n \"a visitori\" Then Stokely moved aside for Matthew to see and there standing at the foot of the ladder was someone he\u0027d never expected.\\n\\n \"\u0027lo, Matthew,\" said John Five. He must\u0027ve just come from the blacksmith\u0027s shop, for though he wore an ordinary white shirt, brown breeches, and boots his face was still ruddy from the furnace fire. \"Can I climb upi\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Of course. Come on.\" Matthew held the trapdoor open as Stokely descended and John Five climbed the ladder. When John was up in the room, Matthew eased the trapdoor shut and went about lighting a couple of candles.\\n\\n \"Nice place,\" John said, gazing around. \"all those books. I should have known.\"\\n\\n \"Pardon me.\" Matthew spent a minute washing his face at the waterbasin. He retrieved his watch from his coat and saw that it was indeed almost ten minutes after five. He wound the watch and held it to his ear to hear the ticking.\\n\\n \"Oh, that\u0027s a fine thing! I didn\u0027t know you made that kind of money!\"\\n\\n \"It was a gift. It is nice, isn\u0027t iti\"\\n\\n \"Somethin\u0027 I\u0027ll likely never have. Can I hold iti\"\\n\\n Matthew gave it to him and prepared a dish of shaving soap while John Five listened to the watch at his remaining ear.\\n\\n \"Ticks pretty, huhi\" John Five asked.\\n\\n \"It does.\"\\n\\n John set the watch down on the bedside table and sniffed the air. \"What\u0027s that smelli\"\\n\\n \"Yarrow oil. I have a sore shoulder.\"\\n\\n \"Oh. I could\u0027ve used that, many a time.\"\\n\\n Matthew applied the soap to his stubble and began to shave with his straight-razor. He could see John Five standing behind him in the small round mirror over the basin. John kept looking around the room, his brow knit. Something was coming, but Matthew had no idea what it was.\\n\\n John cleared his throat. \"Take you to supper.\"\\n\\n Matthew turned around. \"I\u0027m sorryi\"\\n\\n \"Supper. I\u0027ll take you to supper. My coin.\"\\n\\n Matthew continued his shaving, scraping his chin clean, but he watched John Five in the mirror. \"What\u0027s this about, Johni\"\\n\\n a shrug was the first reply. John walked over and peered out the window onto the Broad Way. \"Doesn\u0027t fit you, holdin\u0027 a grudge,\" he said. \"You know what I\u0027m talkin\u0027 at.\"\\n\\n \"I know you\u0027re referring to our disagreement over a certain course of action. But I want you to know as well that I\u0027ve thought a lot about what you\u0027ve said. about Nathan and all the rest of it.\" Matthew paused with the razor at his upper lip. \"Even though I wish things might be different, I know they can\u0027t be. So I\u0027m doing my best to let that go, John. I really am.\"\\n\\n \"Does that mean you don\u0027t hold a grudgei\"\\n\\n Matthew finished the lip before he answered. \"It does.\"\\n\\n \"Whew!\" said John Five, with visible relief. \"Thank God for that!\"\\n\\n Now Matthew was really curious. He washed the blade off and put it aside. \"If your visit is just to discern if I hold a grudge against you, I can promise I don\u0027t. But I\u0027d say that\u0027s not exactly why you\u0027re here. Is iti\"\\n\\n \"No, it\u0027s not.\"\\n\\n Matthew began to wipe his face with a clean cloth. When it was obvious John Five was not going to advance without prodding, Matthew said, \"I\u0027d like to hear it, if you\u0027d like to tell me.\"\\n\\n John nodded. He rubbed his hand over his mouth and stared at the floor, all signs that Matthew took to be the steadying of nerves. Matthew had never seen John Five so jittery, and this alone doubled his curiosity.\\n\\n \"Take you to supper,\" John said. \"I can tell you about it there. Say the Thorn Bush, at seveni\"\\n\\n \"The Thorn Bushi Not my favorite place.\"\\n\\n \"Food\u0027s good and cheap there. and they let me run a bill.\"\\n\\n \"Why not just tell me about it nowi\"\\n\\n \"Because,\" John said, \"I eat supper every Thursday evenin\u0027 at five-thirty with Constance and Reverend Wade. Tonight, especially, I wouldn\u0027t be wantin\u0027 to not show up.\"\\n\\n \"and why is tonight so special, theni\"\\n\\n John drew in a long breath and slowly let it out. \"Because,\" he said quietly, \"it\u0027s the reverend I need to talk to you about. Constance thinks...she thinks...\" He hesitated; it was something he couldn\u0027t quite force himself to spit out.\\n\\n \"Thinks whati\" Matthew urged, just as quietly.\\n\\n John lifted his gaze to Matthew\u0027s. His eyes looked sunken and haunted. \"Constance thinks her father is losin\u0027 his mind.\"\\n\\n The sentence hung between them. Outside, a woman-Mrs. Swaye, from two houses down-was calling for her little boy Giddy to come to supper. a dog barked and a wagon creaked as it was pulled past the window.\\n\\n \"More than that,\" John continued. \"Things she can\u0027t understand. I\u0027ve got to go, Matthew. I\u0027ve got to go sit at that table and know what Constance is thinkin\u0027, and I\u0027ve got to look in Reverend Wade\u0027s face and wonder what I\u0027m seein\u0027. Please meet me at the Thorn Bush at seven. You\u0027ve got to eat somewhere, don\u0027t youi\"\\n\\n Matthew had planned to eat with the Stokelys, but this put a new coat of paint on the fence. The rough-edged Thorn Bush was certainly not the place Matthew would have chosen, though he realized John Five probably wished to go there for one reason other than his credit, which was more easily obtained at the Thorn Bush than at any other tavern in town: you could be faceless in there, if you pleased. The gambling tables and roaming prostitutes focused all attention upon themselves. and it was surely not an establishment into which Reverend Wade nor any of the minister\u0027s friends might wander.\\n\\n \"all right,\" he said. \"If you wish, seven o\u0027clock at the Thorn Bush.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you, Matthew.\" John started to clap Matthew on the right shoulder, but he saw the slick shine of the yarrow oil and stayed his hand. \"I\u0027ll see you there,\" he said, and Matthew lifted the trapdoor to let him descend the ladder.\\n\\n after John Five was gone, Matthew pondered the startling statement he\u0027d just heard. Losing his mindi and how was this condition revealing itselfi he wondered.\\n\\n We have to leave him, Wade had said to Vanderbrocken, over the dead man in the street.\\n\\n Had they been travelling separately, or togetheri and if together, to what destinationi\\n\\n One step at the time, Matthew thought. First, to listen to what John Five had to say, and then to determine what it might mean.\\n\\n He carefully folded his razor and put it away, thinking that the most dangerous edges often lay close at hand. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-queen-of-bedlam-matthew-corbett-2/page-13.html","bookId":2251,"book":{"id":2251,"title":"The Queen of Bedlam (Matthew Corbett #2)","description":"Storyline: The Queen of Bedlam (Matthew Corbett #2) \\n The unsolved murder of a respected doctor has sent ripples of fear throughout a city teeming with life and noise and commerce.
