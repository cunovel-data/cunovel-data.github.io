{"id":71372,"no":52,"title":"Page 52","content":"Seven tents had sprung up near the site of the original settlement on Junior. Nevile Pawkes could see them all from the low ridge on which he stood. They had been there seven days now.\\n\\n He looked up at the sky. The clouds were thick overhead and pregnant with rain. That pleased him. With both suns behind those clouds, the diffused light was gray white. It made things seem almost normal.\\n\\n The wind was damp and a little raw, as though it were April in Vermont. Fawkes was a New Englander and he appreciated the resemblance. In four or five hours, Lagrange I would set and the clouds would turn ruddy while the landscape would become angrily dim. But Fawkes intended to be back in the tents by then.\\n\\n So near the equator, yet so cool! Well, that would change with the millennia. As the glaciers retreated, the air would warm up and the soil would dry out. Jungles and deserts would make their appearance. The water level in the oceans would slowly creep higher, wiping out numberless islands. The two large rivers would become an inland sea, changing the configuration of Junior\u0027s one large continent; perhaps making several smaller ones out of it.\\n\\n He wondered if settlement site would be drowned. Probably, he decided. Maybe that would take the curse off it.\\n\\n He could understand why the Confederation were so damned anxious to solve the mytsery of that first settlement. Even if it were a simple matter of disease, there would have to be proof. Otherwise, who would settle the world? The \"sucker bait\" superstition held for more than merely spacemen.\\n\\n He, himself-Well, his first visit to the settlement site hadn\u0027t been so bad, though he had been glad to leave the rain and the gloom. Returning was worse. It was difficult to sleep with the thought that a thousand mysterious deaths lay all about, separated from him only by that insubstantial thing time.\\n\\n With medical coolness, Novee had dug up the moldering graves of a dozen of the ancient settlers. (Fawkes could not and did not look at the remains.) There had been only crumbling bones, Novee had said, out of which nothing could be made.\\n\\n \"There seem to be abnormalities of bone deposition,\" he said.\\n\\n Then on questioning, he admitted that the effects might be entirely owing to a hundred years\u0027 exposure to damp soil.\\n\\n Fawkes had constructed a fantasy that followed him even into his waking hours. It concerned an elusive race of intelligent beings dwelling underground, never being seen but haunting that first settlement a century back with a deadly perseverance.\\n\\n He pictured a silent bacteriological warfare. He could see them in laboratories beneath the tree roots, culturing their molds and spores, waiting for one that could live on human beings. Perhaps they captured children to experiment upon.\\n\\n And when they found what they were looking for, spores drifted silently out over the settlement in venomous clouds-\\n\\n Fawkes knew all this to be fantasy. He had made it up in the wakeful nights out of no evidence but that of his quivering stomach. Yet alone in the forest, he whirled more than once in a sudden horror-filled conviction that bright eyes were staring out of the duskiness of a tree\u0027s Lagrange I shadow.\\n\\n Fawkes\u0027 botanist\u0027s eye did not miss the vegetation he passed, absorbed as he was. He had deliberately struck out from camp in a new direction, but what he saw was what he had already seen. Junior\u0027s forests were neither thick nor tangled. They were scarcely a barrier to travel. The small trees (few were higher than ten feet, although their trunks were nearly as thick as the average Terrestrial tree) grew with considerable room between them.\\n\\n Fawkes had constructed a rough scheme for arranging the plant life of Junior into some sort of taxonomic order. He was not unaware of the fact that he might be arranging for his own immortality.\\n\\n There was the scarlet \"bayonet tree,\" for instance. Its huge scarlet flowers attracted insect-like creatures that built small nests within it. Then (at what signal or what impulse Fawkes had not divined) all the flowers on some one given tree would grow a glistening white pistil over night. Each pistil stood two feet high, as though every bloom had been suddenly equipped with a bayonet.\\n\\n By the next day, the flower had been fertilized and the petals closed shut-about pistil, insects, and all. The explorer, Mako-yama, had named it the \"bayonet tree,\" but Fawkes had made so bold as to rename it Migrania Fawkes��...\\n\\n One thing the trees had in common. Their wood was incredibly tough. It would be the task of the biochemist to determine the physical state of the cellulose molecule and that of the biophysicist to determine how water could be transported through the wood\u0027s impervious texture. What Fawkes knew from experience was that the blossoms would break if pulled, that the stems would bend only with difficulty and break not at all. His pocketknife was blunted without so much as making a scratch.\\n\\n The original settlers, in order to clear land, had obviously had to dig out the trees, roots and all.\\n\\n Compared to Earth, the woods were almost free of animal life. That might be due to the glacial slaughter. Fawkes didn\u0027t know.\\n\\n The insect-like creatures were all two winged. And those wings were feathery little fronds that beat noiselessly. None, apparently, were bloodsuckers.\\n\\n The only major experience with animals that they had had was the sudden appearance of a large flying creature over the camp. It took high-speed photography to reveal the actual shape of the beast, for the specimen they observed, apparently overcome with curiosity, swooped low over the tents again and again at speeds too great for comfortable, naked-eye observation.\\n\\n It was four-winged, the forward wings terminating in powerful claws, being membranous and nearly naked, serving the office of gliding planes. The hind pair, covered with a hairlike fuzz, beat rapidly.\\n\\n Rodriguez suggested the name Tetrapterus.\\n\\n Fawkes paused in his reminiscence to look at a variety of grass he had not seen before. It grew in a dense patch and each stem forked in three toward the top. He brought out his magnifying glass and felt one of the stems gingerly with his finger. Like other grasses on Junior, it-\\n\\n It was here that he heard the rustle behind him-unmistakable. He listened for a moment, his own heartbeat drowning the sound, then whirled. A small manlike object dodged behind a tree.\\n\\n Fawkes\u0027 breathing nearly stopped. He fumbled for the blaster he wore and his hand seemed to be moving through molasses.\\n\\n Was his fantasy no fantasy at all? Was Junior inhabited after all?\\n\\n Numbly Fawkes found himself behind another tree. He couldn\u0027t leave it at this. He knew that. He could not report to the rest: \"I saw something alive. It might have been the answer to everything. But I was afraid and let it get away.\"\\n\\n He would have to make some attempt\\n\\n There was a \"chalice tree\" just behind the tree that hid the creature. It was in bloom, the white and cream flowers lifted turgidly upward, waiting to catch the rain that would soon fall. There was a sharp tinkle of a breaking flower and cream slivers twisted and turned downward.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t imagination. Something was behind the tree.\\n\\n Fawkes took a deep breath and dashed out, holding his blaster before him, nerving himself to shoot at the slightest sign of danger.\\n\\n But a voice called out, \"Don\u0027t. It\u0027s only I.\" A frightened but definitely human face looked out from behind the tree.\\n\\n It was Mark Annuncio.\\n\\n Fawkes stopped in mid-stride and stared. Finally, he managed to croak, \"What are you doing here?\"\\n\\n Mark said, staring at the blaster in the other\u0027s hand, \"I was following you.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"To see what you would do. I was interested in what you might find. I thought if you saw me, you would send me away.\"\\n\\n Fawkes became conscious of the weapon he was still holding and put it away. It took three tries to get it into the holster.\\n\\n The first fat drops of rain began to fall. Fawkes said harshly, \"Don\u0027t say anything about this to the others.\"\\n\\n He glared hostilely at the youngster and they walked back to camp separately and in silence. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-52.html","bookId":1751,"book":{"id":1751,"title":"The Martian Way and Other Stories","description":"Storyline: This collection of four famous science fiction tales masterfully exemplifies author Isaac Asimov\u0027s ability to create quickly a believable human milieu in the midst of alien circumstances.
