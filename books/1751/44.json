{"id":71364,"no":44,"title":"Page 44","content":"Miguel Antonio Rodriguez y Lopez (microbiologist; small, tawny, with intensely black hair, which he wore rather long, and with a reputation, which he did nothing to discourage, of being a Latin in the grand style as far as the ladies were concerned) cultured the dust from Vemadsky\u0027s gas-analyzer trap with a combination of precision and respectful delicacy. \"Nothing,\" he said eventually. \"What foolish growths I get look harmless.\" It was suggested that Junior\u0027s bacteria need not necessarily look harmful; that toxins and metabolic processes could not be analyzed by eye, even by microscopic eye. This was met with hot contempt, as almost an invasion of professional function. He said, with an eyebrow lifted, \"One gets a feeling for these things. When one has seen as much of the microcosm as I have, one can sense danger-or lack of danger.\" This was an outright lie, and Rodriguez proved it by carefully transferring samples of the various germ colonies into buffered, isotonic media and injecting hamsters with the concentrated result. They did not seem to mind. Raw atmosphere was trapped in large jars and several specimens of minor animal life from Earth and other planets were allowed to disport themselves within. None of them seemed to mind either.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-44.html","bookId":1751,"book":{"id":1751,"title":"The Martian Way and Other Stories","description":"Storyline: This collection of four famous science fiction tales masterfully exemplifies author Isaac Asimov\u0027s ability to create quickly a believable human milieu in the midst of alien circumstances.
