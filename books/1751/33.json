When I\u0027m back with complete minds? Thank you, but no. The enjoyment is too keen.\"\\n\\n \"Did it bother you so much? Intelligence without mental contact?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Roi shortly. Gan tactfully refrained from attempting to follow the line of retreating thought.\\n\\n Instead, he said, \"And the surface?\"\\n\\n Roi said, \"Entirely horrible. What the ancients called \u0027Sun\u0027 is an unbearable patch of brilliance overhead. It is apparently a source of light and varies periodically;\u0027day\u0027 and \u0027night,\u0027 in other words. There is also unpredictable variation.\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Clouds\u0027 perhaps,\" said Gan.\\n\\n \"Why \u0027clouds\u0027?\"\\n\\n \"You know the traditional phrase: \u0027Clouds hid the Sun.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"You think so? Yes, it could be.\"\\n\\n \"Well, go on.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s see. \u0027Ocean\u0027 and \u0027island\u0027 I\u0027ve explained. \u0027Storm\u0027 involves wetness in the air, falling in drops. \u0027Wind\u0027 is a movement of air on a huge scale. \u0027Thunder\u0027 is either a spontaneous, static discharge in the air or a great spontaneous noise. \u0027Sleet\u0027 is falling ice.\"\\n\\n Gan said, \"That\u0027s a curious one. Where would ice fall from? How? Why?\"\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t the slightest idea. It\u0027s all very variable. It will storm at one time and not at another. There are apparently regions on the surface where it is always cold, others where it is always hot, still others where it is both at different times.\"\\n\\n \"Astonishing. How much of this do you suppose is misinterpretation of alien minds?\"\\n\\n \"None. I\u0027m sure of that. It was all quite plain. I had sufficient time to plumb their queer minds. Too much time.\"\\n\\n Again his thoughts drifted back into privacy.\\n\\n Gan said, \"This is well. I\u0027ve been afraid all along of our tendency to romanticize the so-called Golden Age of our surface ancestors. I felt that there would be a strong impulse among our group in favor of a new surface life.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" said Roi vehemently.\\n\\n \"Obviously no. I doubt if the hardiest among us would consider even a day of life in an environment such as you describe, with its storms, days, nights, its indecent and unpredictable variations in environment.\" Gan\u0027s thoughts were contented ones. \"Tomorrow we begin the process of transfer. Once on the island-An uninhabited one, you say.\"\\n\\n \"Entirely uninhabited. It was the only one of that type the vessel passed over. The Tech\u0027s information was detailed.\"\\n\\n \"Good. We will begin operations. It will take generations, Roi, but in the end, we will be in the Deep of a new, warm world, in pleasant caverns where the controlled environment will be conducive to the growth of every culture and refinement.\"\\n\\n \"And,\" added Roi, \"no contact whatever with the surface creatures.\"\\n\\n Gan said, \"Why that? Primitive though they are, they could be of help to us once we establish our base. A race that can build aircraft must have some abilities.\"\\n\\n \"It isn\u0027t that. They\u0027re a belligerent lot, sir. They would attack with animal ferocity at all occasions and-\"\\n\\n Gan interrupted. \"I am disturbed at the psychopenumbra that surrounds your references to the aliens. There\u0027s something you are concealing.\"\\n\\n Roi said, \"I thought at first we could make use of them. If they wouldn\u0027t allow us to be friends, at least, we could control them. I made one of them close contact inside the cube and that was difficult. Very difficult. Their minds are basically different.\"\\n\\n \"In what way?\"\\n\\n \"If I could describe it, the difference wouldn\u0027t be basic. But I can give you an example. I was in the mind of an infant. They don\u0027t have maturation chambers. The infants are in the charge of individuals. The creature who was in charge of my host-\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"She (it was a female) felt a special tie to the young one. There was a sense of ownership, of a relationship that excluded the remainder of their society. I seemed to detect, dimly something of the emotion that binds a man to an associate or friend, but it was far more intense and unrestrained.\"\\n\\n \"Well,\" said Gan, \"without mental contact, they probably have no real conception of society and subrelationships may build up. Or was this one pathological?\"\\n\\n \"No, no. It\u0027s universal. The female in charge was the infant\u0027s mother.\"\\n\\n \"Impossible. Its own mother?\"\\n\\n \"Of necessity. The infant had passed the first part of its existence inside its mother. Physically inside. The creature\u0027s eggs remain within the body. They are inseminated within the body. They grow within the body and emerge alive.\"\\n\\n \"Great caverns,\" Gan said weakly. Distaste was strong within him. \"Each creature would know the identity of its own child. Each child would have a particular father-\"\\n\\n \"And he would be known, too. My host was being taken five thousand miles, as nearly as I could judge the distance, to be seen by its father.\"\\n\\n \"Unbelievable!\"\\n\\n \"Do you need more to see that there can never be any meeting of minds? The difference is so fundamental, so innate.\"\\n\\n The yellowness of regret tinged and roughened Gan\u0027s thought train. He said, \"It would be too bad. I had thought-\"\\n\\n \"What, sir?\"\\n\\n \"I had thought that for the first time there would be two intelligences helping one another. I had thought that together we might progress more quickly than either could alone. Even if they were primitive technologically, as they are, technology isn\u0027t everything. I had thought we might still be able to learn of them.\"\\n\\n \"Learn what?\" asked Roi brutally. \"To know our parents and make friends of our children?\"\\n\\n Gan said, \"No. No, you\u0027re quite right The barrier between us must remain forever complete. They will have the surface and we the Deep, and so it will be.\"\\n\\n Outside the laboratories Roi met Wenda.\\n\\n Her thoughts were concentrated pleasure. \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re back.\"\\n\\n Roi\u0027s thoughts were pleasurable too. It was very restful to make clean mental contact with a friend. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-33.html","bookId":1751,"book":{"id":1751,"title":"The Martian Way and Other Stories","description":"Storyline: This collection of four famous science fiction tales masterfully exemplifies author Isaac Asimov\u0027s ability to create quickly a believable human milieu in the midst of alien circumstances.
