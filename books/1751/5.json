{"id":71325,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"When Hamish Sankov had come to Mars, there was no such thing as a native Martian. Now there were two-hundred-odd babies whose grandfathers had been born on Mars-native in the third generation.\\n\\n When he had come as a boy in his teens, Mars had been scarcely more than a huddle of grounded spaceships connected by sealed underground tunnels. Through the years, he had seen buildings grow and burrow widely, thrusting blunt snouts up into the thin, unbreathable atmosphere. He had seen huge storage depots spring up into which spaceships and their loads could be swallowed whole. He had seen the mines grow from nothing to a huge gouge in the Martian crust, while the population of Mars grew from fifty to fifty thousand.\\n\\n It made him feel old, these long memories-they and the even dimmer memories induced by the presence of this Earthman before him. His visitor brought up those long-forgotten scraps of thought about a soft-warm world that was as kind and gentle to mankind as the mother\u0027s womb.\\n\\n The Earthman seemed fresh from that womb. Not very tall, not very lean; in fact, distinctly plump. Dark hair with a neat little wave in it, a neat little mustache, and neatly scrubbed skin. His clothing was right in style and as fresh and neatly turned as plastek could be.\\n\\n Sankov\u0027s own clothes were of Martian manufacture, serviceable and clean, but many years behind the times. His face was craggy and lined, his hair was pure white, and his Adam\u0027s apple wobbled when he talked.\\n\\n The Earthman was Myron Digby, member of Earth\u0027s General Assembly. Sankov was Martian Commissioner.\\n\\n Sankov said, \"This all hits us hard, Assemblyman.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s hit most of us hard, too, Commissioner.\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh. Can\u0027t honestly say then that I can make it out. Of course, you understand, I don\u0027t make out that I can understand Earth ways, for all that I was born there. Mars is a hard place to live, Assemblyman, and you have to understand that. It takes a lot of shipping space just to bring us food, water, and raw materials so we can live. There\u0027s not much room left for books and news films. Even video programs can\u0027t reach Mars, except for about a month when Earth is in conjunction, and even then nobody has much time to listen.\\n\\n \"My office gets a weekly summary film from Planetary Press.\\n\\n Generally, I don\u0027t have time to pay attention to it. Maybe you\u0027d call us provincial, and you\u0027d be right. When something like this happens, all we can do is kind of helplessly look at each other.\"\\n\\n Digby said slowly, \"You can\u0027t mean that your people on Mars haven\u0027t heard of Hilder\u0027s anti-Waster campaign.\"\\n\\n \"No, can\u0027t exactly say that. There\u0027s a young Scavenger, son of a good friend of mine who died in space\"-Sankov scratched the side of his neck doubtfully-,\"who makes a hobby out of reading up on Earth history and things like that. He catches video broadcasts when he\u0027s out in space and he listened to this man Hilder. Near as I can make out, that was the first talk Hilder made about Wasters.\\n\\n \"The young fellow came to me with that. Naturally, I didn\u0027t take him very serious. I kept an eye on the Planetary Press films for a while after that, but there wasn\u0027t much mention of Hilder and what there was made him out to look pretty funny.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Commissioner,\" said Digby, \"it all seemed quite a joke When it started.\"\\n\\n Sankov stretched out a pair of long legs to one side of his desk and crossed them at the ankles. \"Seems to me it\u0027s still pretty much of a joke. What\u0027s his argument? We\u0027re using up water. Has he tried looking at some figures? I got them all here. Had them brought to me when this committee arrived.\\n\\n \"Seems that Earth has four hundred million cubic miles of water in its oceans and each cubic mile weighs four and a half billion tons. That\u0027s a lot of water. Now we use some of that heap in space flight. Most of the thrust is inside Earth\u0027s gravitational field, and that means the water thrown out finds its way back to the oceans. Hilder doesn\u0027t figure that in. When he says a million tons of water is used up per flight, he\u0027s a liar. It\u0027s less than a hundred thousand tons.\\n\\n \"Suppose, now, we have fifty thousand flights a year. We don\u0027t, of course; not even fifteen hundred. But let\u0027s say there are fifty thousand. I figure there\u0027s going to be considerable expansion as time goes on. With fifty thousand flights, one cubic mile of water would be lost to space each year. That means that in a million years, Earth would lose one quarter of 1 per cent of its total water supply!\"\\n\\n Digby spread his hands, palms upward, and let them drop. \"Commissioner, Interplanetary Alloys has used figures like that in their campaign against Hilder, but you can\u0027t fight a tremendous, emotion-filled drive with cold mathematics. This man Hilder has invented a name, \u0027Wasters.\u0027 Slowly he has built this name up into a gigantic conspiracy; a gang of brutal, profit-seeking wretches raping Earth for their own immediate benefit.\\n\\n \"He has accused the government of being riddled with them, the Assembly of being dominated by them, the press of being owned by them. None of this, unfortunately, seems ridiculous to the average man. He knows all too well what selfish men can do to Earth\u0027s resources. He knows what happened to Earth\u0027s oil during the Time of Troubles, for instance, and the way top-soil was ruined.\\n\\n \"When a farmer experiences a drought, he doesn\u0027t care that the amount of water lost in space flight isn\u0027t a droplet in a fog as far as Earth\u0027s over-all water supply is concerned. Hilder has given him something to blame and that\u0027s the strongest possible consolation for disaster. He isn\u0027t going to give that up for a diet of figures.\"\\n\\n Sankov said, \"That\u0027s where I get puzzled. Maybe it\u0027s because I don\u0027t know how things work on Earth, but it\u0027seems to me that there aren\u0027t just droughty farmers there. As near as I could make out from the news summaries, these Hilder people are a minority. Why is it Earth goes along with a few farmers and some crackpots that egg them on?\"\\n\\n \"Because, Commissioner, there are such things as worried human beings. The steel industry sees that an era of space flight will stress increasingly the light, nonferrous alloys. The various miners\u0027 unions worry about extraterrestrial competition. Any Earthman who can\u0027t get aluminum to build a prefab is certain that it is because the aluminum is going to Mars. I know a professor of archaeology who\u0027s an anti-Waster because he can\u0027t get a government grant to cover his excavations. He\u0027s convinced that all government money is going into rocketry research and space medicine and he resents it.\"\\n\\n Sankov said, \"That doesn\u0027t sound like Earth people are much different from us here on Mars. But what about the General Assembly? Why do they have to go along with Hilder?\"\\n\\n Digby smiled sourly. \"Politics isn\u0027t pleasant to explain. Hilder introduced this bill to set up a committee to investigate waste in space flight. Maybe three fourths or more of the General Assembly was against such an investigation as an intolerable and useless extension of bureaucracy-which it is. But then how could any legislator be against a mere investigation of waste? It would sound as though he had something to fear or to conceal. It would sound as though he were himself profiting from waste. Hilder is not in the least afraid of making such accusations, and whether true or not, they would be a powerful factor with the voters in the next election. The bill passed.\\n\\n \"And then there came the question of appointing the members of the committee. Those who were against Hilder shied away from membership, which would have meant decisions that would be continually embarrassing. Remaining on the side lines would make that one that much less a target for Hilder. The result is that I am the only member of the committee who is outspokenly anti-Hilder and it may cost me re-election.\"\\n\\n Sankov said, \"I\u0027d be sorry to hear that, Assemblyman. It looks as though Mars didn\u0027t have as many friends as we thought we had. We wouldn\u0027t like to lose one. But if Hilder wins out, what\u0027s he after, anyway?\"\\n\\n \"I should think,\" said Digby, \"that that is obvious. He wants to be the next Global Co-ordinator.\"\\n\\n \"Think he\u0027ll make it?\"\\n\\n \"If nothing happens to stop him, he will.\"\\n\\n \"And then what? Will he drop this Waster campaign then?\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t say. I don\u0027t know if he\u0027s laid his plans past the Co-ordinacy. Still, if you want my guess, he couldn\u0027t abandon the campaign and maintain his popularity. It\u0027s gotten out of hand.\"\\n\\n Sankov scratched the side of his neck. \"All right. In that case, I\u0027ll ask you for some advice. What can we folks on Mars do?\\n\\n You know Earth. You know the situation. We don\u0027t. Tell us what to do.\"\\n\\n Digby rose and stepped to the window. He looked out upon the low domes of other buildings; red, rocky, completely desolate plain in between; a purple sky and a shrunken sun.\\n\\n He said, without turning, \"Do you people really like it on Mars?\"\\n\\n Sankov smiled. \"Most of us don\u0027t exactly know any other world, Assemblyman. Seems to me Earth would be something queer and uncomfortable to them.\"\\n\\n \"But wouldn\u0027t Martians get used to it? Earth isn\u0027t hard to take after this. Wouldn\u0027t your people learn to enjoy the privilege of breathing air under an open sky? You once lived on Earth. You remember what it was like.\"\\n\\n \"I sort of remember. Still, it doesn\u0027t seem to be easy to explain. Earth is just there. It fits people and people fit it. People take Earth the way they find it. Mars is different. It\u0027s sort of raw and doesn\u0027t fit people. People got to make something out of it. They got to build a world, and not take what they find. Mars isn\u0027t much yet, but we\u0027re building, and when we\u0027re finished, we\u0027re going to have just what we like. It\u0027s sort of a great feeling to know you\u0027re building a world. Earth would be kind of unexciting after that.\"\\n\\n The Assemblyman said, \"Surely the ordinary Martian isn\u0027t such a philosopher that he\u0027s content to live this terribly hard life for the sake of a future that must be hundreds of generations away.\"\\n\\n \"No-o, not just like that.\" Sankov put his right ankle on his left knee and cradled it as he spoke. \"Like I said, Martians are a lot like Earthmen which means they\u0027re sort of human beings, and human beings don\u0027t go in for philosophy much. Just the same, there\u0027s something to living in a growing world, whether you think about it much or not.\\n\\n \"My father used to send me letters when I first came to Mars. He was an accountant and he just sort of stayed an accountant. Earth wasn\u0027t much different when he died from what it was. When he was born. He didn\u0027t see anything happen. Every day was like every other day, and living was just a way of passing time until he died.\\n\\n \"On Mars, it\u0027s different. Every day there\u0027s something new- the city\u0027s bigger, the ventilation system gets another kick, the water lines from the poles get slicked up. Right now, we\u0027re planning to set up a news-film association of our own. We\u0027re going to call it Mars Press. If you haven\u0027t lived when things are growing all about you, you\u0027ll never understand how wonderful it feels.\\n\\n \"No, Assemblyman, Mars is hard and tough and Earth is a lot more comfortable, but seems to me if you take our boys to Earth, they\u0027ll be unhappy. They probably wouldn\u0027t be able to figure out why, most of diem, but they\u0027d feel lost; lost and useless. Seems to me lots of them would never make the adjustment.\"\\n\\n Digby turned away from the window and the smooth, pink skin of his forehead was creased into a frown. \"In that case, Commissioner, I am sorry for you. For all of you.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Because I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything your people on Mars can do. Or the people on the Moon or Venus. It won\u0027t happen now; maybe it won\u0027t happen for a year or two, or even for five years. But pretty soon you\u0027ll all have to come back to Earth, unless-\"\\n\\n Sankov\u0027s white eyebrows bent low over his eyes. \"Well?\"\\n\\n Unless you can find another source of water besides the planet Earth.\"\\n\\n Sankov shook his head. \"Don\u0027t seem likely, does it?\"\\n\\n \"Not very.\"\\n\\n \"And except for that, seems to you there\u0027s no chance?\"\\n\\n \"None at all.\"\\n\\n Digby said that and left, and Sankov stared for a long time at nothing before he punched a combination of the local communiline.\\n\\n After a while, Ted Long looked out at him.\\n\\n Sankov said, \"You were right, son. There\u0027s nothing they can do. Even the ones that mean well see no way out. How did you know?\"\\n\\n \"Commissioner,\" said Long, \"when you\u0027ve read all you can about the Time of Troubles, particularly about the twentieth century, nothing political can come as a real surprise.\"\\n\\n \"Well, maybe. Anyway, son, Assemblyman Digby is sorry for us, quite a piece sorry, you might say, but that\u0027s all. He says we\u0027ll have to leave Mars-or else get water somewhere else. Only he thinks that we can\u0027t get water somewhere else.\"\\n\\n \"You know we can, don\u0027t you, Commissioner?\"\\n\\n \"I know we might, son. It\u0027s a terrible risk.\"\\n\\n \"If I find enough volunteers, the risk is our business.\"\\n\\n \"How is it going?\"\\n\\n \"Not bad. Some of the boys are on my side right now. I talked Mario Rioz into it, for instance, and you know he\u0027s one of the best.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s just it-the volunteers will be the best men we have. I hate to allow it.\"\\n\\n \"If we get back, it will be worth, it\"\\n\\n \"If! It\u0027s a big word, son.\"\\n\\n \"And a big thing we\u0027re trying to do.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I gave my word that if there was no help on Earth, I\u0027ll see that the Phobos water hole lets you have all the water you\u0027ll need. Good luck.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-5.html","bookId":1751,"book":{"id":1751,"title":"The Martian Way and Other Stories","description":"Storyline: This collection of four famous science fiction tales masterfully exemplifies author Isaac Asimov\u0027s ability to create quickly a believable human milieu in the midst of alien circumstances.
