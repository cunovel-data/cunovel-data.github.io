My men are unsettled. Very unsettled.\"\n The port shields were open. Lagrange I was six hours gone, and Lagrange II\u0027s ruddy light, deepened to crimson in setting, flushed the Captain\u0027s face and tinged his short gray hair with red.\n Cimon, whose attitude toward the crew in general and the Captain in particular was one of controlled impatience, said, \"What is the trouble, Captain?\"\n \"Been here two weeks, Earth time.

He said, \"My papers say I don\u0027t have to stay if ship\u0027s safety is endangered. A frightened and mutinous crew is something I don\u0027t want\"\n \"Can\u0027t you handle your own men?\"\n \"Within reason.\"\n \"Well, what really bothers them?

Besides, surface leave is necessary. Crew\u0027s got to have it. Even if it\u0027s just on a bare rock a mile across. Gets them out of the ship. Away from the routine. Can\u0027t deny them that.\"\n \"Give me till tomorrow,\" said Cimon contemptuously. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-47.html","bookId":1751,"book":{"id":1751,"title":"The Martian Way and Other Stories","description":"Storyline: \n This collection of four famous science fiction tales masterfully exemplifies author Isaac Asimov\u0027s ability to create quickly a believable human milieu in the midst of alien circumstances.
