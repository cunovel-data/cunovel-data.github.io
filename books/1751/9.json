They had to be laid precisely; their geometry had to be very nearly perfect for the magnetic field to attain maximum strength. In space, or even in air, it wouldn\u0027t have mattered. The cables would have lined up automatically once the juice went on.\\n\\n Here it was different. A gouge had to be plowed along the planetoid\u0027s surface and into it the cable had to be laid. If it were not lined up within a few minutes of arc of the calculated direction, a torque would be applied to the entire planetoid, with consequent loss of energy, none of which could be spared. The gouges then had to be redriven, the cables shifted and iced into the new positions.\\n\\n The men plodded wearily through the routine.\\n\\n And then the word reached them:\\n\\n \"All hands to the jets!\"\\n\\n Scavengers could not be said to be the type that took kindly to discipline. It was a grumbling, growling, muttering group that set about disassembling the jets of the ships that yet remained intact, carrying them to the tail end of the planetoid, grubbing them into position, and stringing the leads along the surface.\\n\\n It was almost twenty-four hours before one of them looked into the sky and said, \"Holy jeepers!\" followed by something less printable.\\n\\n His neighbor looked and said, \"I\u0027ll be damned!\"\\n\\n Once they noticed, all did. It became the most astonishing fact in the Universe.\\n\\n \"Look at the Shadow!\"\\n\\n It was spreading across the sky life an infected wound. Men looked at it, found it had doubled its size, wondered why they hadn\u0027t noticed that sooner.\\n\\n Work came to a virtual halt. They besieged Ted Long.\\n\\n He said, \"We can\u0027t leave. We don\u0027t have the fuel to see us back to Mars and we don\u0027t have the equipment to capture another planetoid. So we\u0027ve got to stay. Now the Shadow is creeping in on us because our blasting has thrown us out of orbit. We\u0027ve got to change that by continuing the blasting. Since we can\u0027t blast the front end any more without endangering the ship we\u0027re building, let\u0027s try another way.\"\\n\\n They went back to work on the jets with a furious energy that received impetus every half hour when the Shadow rose again over the horizon, bigger and more menacing than before.\\n\\n Long had no assurance that it would work. Even if the jets would respond to the distant controls, even if the supply of water, which depended upon a storage chamber opening directly into the icy body of the planetoid, with built-in heat projectors steaming the propulsive fluid directly into the driving cells, were adequate, there was still no certainty that the body of the planetoid without a magnetic cable sheathing would hold together under the enormously disruptive stresses.\\n\\n \"Ready!\" came the signal in Long\u0027s receiver.\\n\\n Long called, \"Ready!\" and depressed the contact\\n\\n The vibration grew about him. The star field in the visiplate trembled.\\n\\n In the rearview there was a distant gleaming spume of swiftly moving ice crystals.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s blowing!\" was the cry.\\n\\n It kept on blowing. Long dared not stop. For six hours, it blew, hissing, bubbling, steaming into space; the body of the planetoid converted to vapor and hurled away.\\n\\n The Shadow came closer until men did nothing but stare at the mountain in the sky, surpassing Saturn itself in spectacularity. Its every groove and valley was a plain scar upon its face. But when it passed through the planetoid\u0027s orbit it crossed more than half a mile behind its then position.\\n\\n The steam jet ceased.\\n\\n Long bent in his seat and covered his eyes. He hadn\u0027t eaten in two days. He could eat now, though. Not another planetoid was close enough to interrupt them, even if it began an approach that very moment\\n\\n Back on the planetoid\u0027s surface, Swenson said, \"All the time I watched that damned rock coming down, I kept saying to myself, \u0027This can\u0027t happen. We can\u0027t let it happen.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"Hell,\" said Rioz, \"we were all nervous. Did you see Jim Davis? He was green. I was a little jumpy myself.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not it. It wasn\u0027t just-dying, you know. I was thinking-I know it\u0027s funny, but I can\u0027t help it-I was thinking that Dora warned me I\u0027d get myself killed, she\u0027ll never let me hear the last of it. Isn\u0027t that a crummy sort of attitude at a time like that?\"\\n\\n \"Listen,\" said Rioz, \"you wanted to get married, so you got married. Why come to me with your troubles?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-9.html","bookId":1751,"book":{"id":1751,"title":"The Martian Way and Other Stories","description":"Storyline: This collection of four famous science fiction tales masterfully exemplifies author Isaac Asimov\u0027s ability to create quickly a believable human milieu in the midst of alien circumstances.
