A long, thin object passed across his line of vision and a voice, just heard above the humming in his ears, said, \"He\"ll come to now, Cimon.\"\n Sheffield closed his eyes. Somehow he seemed to be aware of the fact that his skull was thoroughly bandaged.\n He lay quietly for a minute, breathing deeply. When he opened his eyes again, the faces above him were clear. There was Novee\u0027s round face, a small, professionally serious line between his eyes that cleared away when Sheffield said, \"Hello, Novee.\"\n The other man was Cimon, jaws set and angry, yet with a look of something like satisfaction in his eyes.\n Sheffield said, \"Where are we?\"\n Cimon said coldly, \"In space, Dr. Sheffield. Two days out in space.\"\n \"Two days out-\" Sheffield\u0027s eyes widened.\n Novee interposed. \"You\u0027ve had a bad concussion, nearly a fracture, Sheffield. Take it easy.\"\n \"Well, what hap- Where\u0027s Mark? Where\u0027s Mark?\";\n \"Easy. Easy now.\" Novee put a hand on each of Sheffield\u0027s shoulders and pressed him down.\n Cimon said, \"Your boy is in the brig. In case you want to know why, he deliberately caused mutiny on board ship, thus endangering the safety of five men. We were almost marooned at our temporary camp because the crew wanted to leave immediately. He persuaded them, the Captain did, to pick us up.\"\n Sheffield tried to brush Novee\u0027s restraining arm to one side. That fuzzy memory of Mark and a man with a bat. Mark saying \"... a thousand people all dead...\"\n The psychologist hitched himself up on one elbow with a tremendous effort. \"Listen, Cimon, I don\u0027t know why Mark did it, but let me talk to him. I\u0027ll find out.\"\n Cimon said, \"No need of that. It will all come out at the trial.\"\n Sheffield tried to brush Novee\u0027s restraining arm to one side. \"But why make it formal? Why involve the Bureau? We can settle this among ourselves.\"\n \"That\u0027s exactly what we intend to do. The Captain is empowered by the laws of space to preside over trials involving crimes and misdemeanors in deep space.\"\n \"The Captain. A trial here? On board ship? Cimon, don\u0027t let him do it. It will be murder.\"\n \"Not at all. It will be a fair and proper trial. I\u0027m in full agreement with the Captain. Discipline demands a trial.\"\n Novee said uneasily, \"Look, Cimon, I wish you wouldn\u0027t. He\u0027s in no shape to take this.\"\n \"Too bad,\" said Cimon.\n Sheffield said, \"But you don\u0027t understand. I\u0027m responsible for the boy.\"\n \"On the contrary, I do understand,\" said Cimon. \"It\u0027s why we\u0027ve been waiting for you to regain consciousness. You\u0027re standing trial with him.\"\n \"What!\"\n \"You are generally responsible for his actions. Specifically, you were with him when he stole the air-coaster. The crew saw you at the coaster\u0027s cabin door while Mark was inciting mutiny.\"\n \"But he cracked my skull in order to take the coaster. Can\u0027t you see that\u0027s the act of a seriously disturbed mind? He can\u0027t be held responsible.\"\n \"We\u0027ll let the Captain decide, Sheffield. You stay with him, Novee.\" He turned to go.\n Sheffield called on what strength he could muster. \"Cimon,\" he shouted, \"You\u0027re doing this to get back at me for the lesson in psychology I taught you. You\u0027re a narrow-petty-\"\n He fell back on his pillow, breathless.\n Cimon, from the door, said, \"And by the way, Sheffield, the penalty for inciting mutiny on board ship is death!\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-57.html","bookId":1751,"book":{"id":1751,"title":"The Martian Way and Other Stories","description":"Storyline: \n This collection of four famous science fiction tales masterfully exemplifies author Isaac Asimov\u0027s ability to create quickly a believable human milieu in the midst of alien circumstances.
