{"id":71371,"no":51,"title":"Page 51","content":"\"Well now, Dr. Sheffield, what is it?\" said Cimon. The astrophysicist sat at his desk, on which papers and film formed rigidly arranged heaps about a small Macfreed integrator, and watched Sheffield step over the threshold.\\n\\n Sheffield sat carelessly down upon the tautly yanked topsheet of Cimon\u0027s bunk. He was aware of Cimon\u0027s annoyed glance in that direction and it did not worry him. In fact, he rather enjoyed it.\\n\\n He said, \"I have a quarrel with your choice of men to go to the expedition site. It looks as though you\u0027ve picked two men for the physical sciences and three for the biological sciences. Right?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"I suppose you think you\u0027ve covered the ground like a Danielski ovospore at perihelion.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, space! Have you anything to suggest?\"\\n\\n \"I would like to come along myself.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"You have no one to take care of the mental sciences.\"\\n\\n \"The mental sciences! Good Galaxy! Dr. Sheffield, five men are quite enough to risk. As a matter of fact, Doctor, you and your-uh-ward were assigned to the scientific personnel of this ship by order of the Bureau of Outer Provinces without any prior consultation of myself. I\u0027ll be frank. If I had been consulted, I would have advised against you. I don\u0027t see the function of mental science in an investigation such as this, which, after all, is purely physical. It is too bad that the Bureau wishes to experiment with Mnemonics on an occasion such as this. We can\u0027t afford scenes like that one with Rodriguez.\"\\n\\n Sheffield decided that Cimon did not know of Mark\u0027s connection with the original decision to send out the expedition.\\n\\n He sat upright, hands on knees, elbows cocked outward, and let a freezing formality settle over him. \"So you wonder about the function of mental science in an investigation such as this, Dr. Cimon. Suppose I told you that the end of the first settlement might possibly be explained on a simple, psychological basis.\"\\n\\n \"It wouldn\u0027t impress me. A psychologist is a man who can explain anything and prove nothing.\" Cimon smirked like a man who had made an epigram and was proud of it\\n\\n Sheffield ignored it. He said, \"Let me go into a little detail. In what way is Junior different from every one of the eightythree thousand inhabited worlds?\"\\n\\n \"Our information is as yet incomplete. I cannot say.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, cobber-vitals. You had the necessary information before you ever came here. Junior has two suns.\"\\n\\n \"Well, of course.\" But the astrophysicist allowed a trace of discomfiture to enter his expression.\\n\\n \"Colored suns, mind you. Colored suns. Do you know what that means? It means that a human being, yourself or myself, standing in the full glare of the two suns, would cast two shadows. One blue green, one red orange. The length of each would naturally vary with the time of day. Have you taken the trouble to verify the color distribution in those shadows? The what-do-you-call-\u0027em-reflection spectrum?\"\\n\\n \"I presume,\" said Cimon loftily, \"they\u0027d be about the same as the radiation spectra of the suns. What are you getting at?\"\\n\\n \"You should check. Wouldn\u0027t the air absorb some wave lengths? And the vegetation? What\u0027s left? And take Junior\u0027s moon, Sister. I\u0027ve been watching it in the last few nights. It\u0027s in colors, too, and the colors change position.\"\\n\\n \"Well, of course, damn it. It runs through its phases independently with each sun.\"\\n\\n \"You haven\u0027t checked its reflection spectrum, either, have you?\"\\n\\n \"We have that somewhere. There are no points of interest about it. Of what interest is it to you, anyway?\"\\n\\n \"My dear Dr. Cimon, it is a well-established psychological fact that combinations of red and green colors exert a deleterious effect on mental stability. We have a case here where the red-green chromopsychic picture (to use a technical term) is inescapable and is presented under circumstances which seem most unnatural to the human mind. It is quite possible that chromopsychosis could reach the fatal level by inducing hypertrophy of the trinitarian follicles, with consequent cerebric catatonia.\"\\n\\n Cimon looked floored. He said, \"I never heard of such a thing.\"\\n\\n \"Naturally not,\" said Sheffield (it was his turn to be lofty). \"You are not a psychologist. Surely you are not questioning my professional opinion.\"\\n\\n \"No, of course not. But it\u0027s quite plain from the last reports of the expedition that they were dying of something that sounded like a respiratory disease.\"\\n\\n \"Correct, but Rodriguez denies that and you accepted his professional opinion.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t say it was a respiratory disease. I said it sounded like one. Where does your red-green chromothingumbob come in?\"\\n\\n Sheffield shook his head. \"You laymen have your misconceptions. Granted that there is a physical effect, it still does not imply that there may not be a mental cause. The most convincing point about my theory is that red-green chromopsychosis has been recorded to exhibit itself first as a psychogenic respiratory infection. I take it you are not acquainted with psycho-genics.\"\\n\\n \"No, It\u0027s out of my field.\"\\n\\n \"Well, yes. I should say so. Now my own calculations show me that under the heightened oxygen tension of this world, the psychogenic respiratory infection is both inevitable and particularly severe. For instance, you\u0027ve observed the moon-Sister, I mean-in the last few nights.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I have observed Ilium.\" Cimon did not forget Sister\u0027s official name even now.\\n\\n \"You watched it closely and over lengthy periods? Under magnification?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" Cimon was growing uneasy.\\n\\n \"Ah,\" said Sheffield. \"Now the moon colors in the last few nights have been particularly virulent. Surely you must be noticing just a small inflammation of the mucus membrane of the nose, a slight itching in the throat. Nothing painful yet, I imagine. Have you been coughing or sneezing? Is it a little hard to swallow?\"\\n\\n \"I believe I-\" Cimon swallowed, then drew in his breath sharply. He was testing.\\n\\n Then he sprang to his feet, fists clenched and mouth working. \"Great galaxy, Sheffield, you had no right to keep quiet about this. I can feel it now. What do I do, Sheffield? It\u0027s not incurable, is it? Damn it, Sheffield\"-his voice went shrill- \"why didn\u0027t you tell us this before?\"\\n\\n \"Because,\" said Sheffield calmly, \"there\u0027s not a word of truth in anything I\u0027ve said. Not one word. There\u0027s no harm in colours. Sit down, Dr. Cimon. You\u0027re beginning to look foolish.\"\\n\\n \"You said,\" said Cimon, thoroughly confused, and in a voice that was beginning to strangle, \"that it was your professional opinion that-\"\\n\\n \"My professional opinion! Space and little comets, Cimon, what\u0027s so magic about a professional opinion? A man can be lying or he can just plain be ignorant, even about the final details of his own specialty. A professional can be wrong because he\u0027s ignorant of a neighboring specialty. He may be certain he\u0027s right and still be wrong.\\n\\n \"Look at you. You know all about what makes the Universe tick and I\u0027m lost completely except that I know that a star is something that twinkles and a light-year is something that\u0027s long. And yet you\u0027ll swallow gibberish psychology that a freshman student of mentics would laugh his head off at. Don\u0027t you think, Cimon, it\u0027s time we worried less about professional opinion and more about over-all co-ordination?\"\\n\\n The color washed slowly out of Cimon\u0027s face. It turned waxy-pale. His lips trembled. He whispered, \"You used professional status as a cloak to make a fool of me.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s about it,\" said Sheffield.\\n\\n \"I have never, never-\" Cimon gasped and tried a new start. \"I have never witnessed anything as cowardly and unethical.\"\\n\\n \"I was trying to make a point.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, you made it. You made it.\" Cimon was slowly recovering, his voice approaching normality. \"You want me to take that boy of yours with us.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n \"No. No. Definitely no. It was no before you came in here and it\u0027s no a million times over now.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s your reason? I mean before I came in.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s psychotic. He can\u0027t be trusted with normal people.\"\\n\\n Sheffield said grimly, \"I\u0027ll thank you not to use the word, \u0027psychotic.\u0027 You are not competent to use it. If you\u0027re so precise in your feeling for professional ethics, remember to stay out of my specialty in my presence. Mark Annuncio is perfectly normal.\"\\n\\n \"After that scene with Rodriguez? Yes. Oh, yes.\"\\n\\n \"Mark had the right to- ask- his question. It was his job to do so and his duty. Rodriguez had no right to be boorish about it.\"\\n\\n \"I\"ll have to consider Rodriguez first, if you don\u0027t mind.\"\\n\\n \"Why? Mark Annuncio knows more than Rodriguez. For that matter, he knows more than you or I. Are you trying to bring back an intelligent report or to satisfy a petty vanity?\"\\n\\n \"Your statements about what your boy knows do not impress me. I am quite aware he is an efficient parrot. He understands nothing, however. It is my duty to see to it that data is made available to him because the Bureau has ordered that. They did not consult me, but very well. I will co-operate that far. He will receive his data here in the ship.\"\\n\\n Sheffield said, \"Not adequate, Cimon. He should be on the spot. He may see things our precious specialists will not.\"\\n\\n Cimon said freezingly, \"Very likely. The answer, Sheffield, is no. There is no argument that can possibly persuade me.\" The astrophysist\u0027s nose was pinched and white.\\n\\n \"Because I made a fool of you?\"\\n\\n \"Because you violated the most fundamental obligation of a professional man. No respectable professional would ever use his specialty to prey on the innocence of a non-associate professional.\"\\n\\n \"So I made a fool of you.\"\\n\\n Cimon turned away. \"Please leave. There will be no further communication between us, outside the most necessary business, for the duration of the trip.\"\\n\\n \"If I go,\" said Sheffield, \"the rest of the boys may get to hear about this.\"\\n\\n Cimon started. \"You\u0027re going to repeat our little affair?\" A cold smile rested on his lips, then went its transient and contemptuous way. \"You\u0027ll broadcast the dastard you were.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I doubt they\u0027ll take it seriously. Everyone know psychologists will have their little jokes. Besides, they\u0027ll be so busy laughing at you. You know-the every impressive Dr. Cimon scared into a sore throat and howling for mercy after a few mystic words of gibberish.\"\\n\\n \"Who\u0027d believe you?\" cried Cimon.\\n\\n Sheffield lifted his right hand. Between thumb and forefinger was a small rectangular object, studded with a line of control toggles.\\n\\n \"Pocket recorder,\" he said. He touched one of the toggles and Cimon\u0027s voice was suddenly saying, \"Well, now, Dr. Sheffield, what is it?\"\\n\\n It sounded pompous, peremptory, and even a little smug.\\n\\n \"Give me that!\" Cimon hurled himself at the lanky psychologist.\\n\\n Sheffield held him off. \"Don\u0027t try force, Cimon. I was in amateur wrestling not too long ago. Look, I\"ll make a deal with you.\"\\n\\n Cimon was still writhing toward him, dignity forgotten, panting his fury. Sheffield kept him at arm\u0027s length, backing slowly.\\n\\n Sheffield said, \"Let Mark and myself come along and no one will ever see or hear this.\"\\n\\n Slowly Cimon simmered down. He gasped, \"Will you let me have it, then?\"\\n\\n \"After Mark and I are out at the settlement site.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m to trust you.\" He seemed to take pains to make that as offensive as possible.\\n\\n \"Why not? You can certainly trust me to broadcast this if you don\u0027t agree. I\u0027ll play it off for Vernadsky first. He\u0027ll love it. You know his corny sense of humor.\"\\n\\n Cimon said in a voice so low it could hardly be heard, \"You and the boy can come along.\" Then vigorously, \"But remember this, Sheffield. When we get back to Earth, I\"ll have you before the Central Committee of the G.A.A.S. That\u0027s a promise. You\u0027ll be de-professionalized.\"\\n\\n Sheffield said, \"I\u0027m not afraid of the Galactic Association for the Advancement of Science.\" He let the syllables resound. \"After all, what will you accuse me of? Are you going to play this recording before the Central Committee as evidence? Come, come, let\u0027s be friendly about this. You don\u0027t want to broadcast your own-uh-mistake before the primest stuffed shirts in eighty-three thousand worlds.\"\\n\\n Smiling gently, he backed out the door.\\n\\n But when he closed the door between himself and Cimon, his smile vanished. He hadn\u0027t liked to do this. Now that he had done it, he wondered if it were worth the enemy he had made. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-51.html","bookId":1751,"book":{"id":1751,"title":"The Martian Way and Other Stories","description":"Storyline: This collection of four famous science fiction tales masterfully exemplifies author Isaac Asimov\u0027s ability to create quickly a believable human milieu in the midst of alien circumstances.
