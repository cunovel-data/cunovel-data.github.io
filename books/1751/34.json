{"id":71354,"no":34,"title":"Page 34","content":"The ship Triple G. flashed silently out of the nothingness of hyperspace and into the allness of space-time. It emerged into the glitter of the great star cluster of Hercules.\n It poised gingerly in space, surrounded by suns and suns and suns, each centering a gravitational field that wrenched at the little bubble of metal. But the ship\u0027s computers had done well and it had pin-pricked squarely into position. It was within a day\u0027s journey-ordinary space-drive journey-of the Lagrange System.\n This fact had varying significance, to the different men aboard ship. To the crew, it was another day\u0027s work and another day\u0027s flight pay and then shore rest. The planet for which they were aiming was uninhabited, but shore rest could be a pleasant interlude even on an asteroid. They did not trouble themselves concerning a possible difference of opinion among the passengers.\n The crew, in fact, were rather contemptuous of the passengers, and avoided them.\n Eggheads!\n And so they were, every one of them but one. Scientists, in politer terms-and a heterogeneous lot. Their nearest approach to a common emotion at that moment was a final anxiety for their instruments, a vague desire for a last check.\n And perhaps just a small increase of tension and anxiety. It was an uninhabited planet. Each had expressed himself as firmly of that belief a number of times. Still, each man\u0027s thoughts are his own.\n As for the one unusual man on board ship-not a crewman and not really a scientist-his strongest feeling was one of bone-weariness. He stirred to his feet weakly and fought off the last dregs of space-sickness. He was Mark Annuncio, and he had been in bed now for four days, feeding on almost nothing, while the ship wove in and out of the Universe, jumping its light-years of space.\n But now he felt less certain of imminent death and he had to answer the summons of the Captain. In his inarticulate way, Mark resented that summons. He was used to having his own way, seeing what he felt like seeing. Who was the Captain to-\n The impulse kept returning to tell Dr. Sheffield about this and let it rest there.\n But Mark was curious, so he knew he would have to go.\n It was his one great vice. Curiosity!\n It also happened to be his profession and his mission in life. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-34.html","bookId":1751,"book":{"id":1751,"title":"The Martian Way and Other Stories","description":"Storyline: \n This collection of four famous science fiction tales masterfully exemplifies author Isaac Asimov\u0027s ability to create quickly a believable human milieu in the midst of alien circumstances.
