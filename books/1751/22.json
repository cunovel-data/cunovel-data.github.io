Scooping them up, keeping them in a cage, giving them grass and raw meat to eat? Tell me how to speak to them.\" \"It may take a little time. Think at them. Try to listen. It will come to you, but perhaps not right away.\" The Industrialist tried. He grimaced with the effort of it, thinking over and over again, The youngsters were ignorant of your identity. And the thought was suddenly in his mind, We were quite aware of it and because we knew they meant well by us according to their own view of the matter, we did not attempt to attack them. Attack them? thought the Industrialist, and said it aloud in his concentration. Why, yes, came the answering thought. We are armed. One of the revolting little creatures in the cage lifted a metal object and there was a sudden hole in the top of the cage and another in the roof of the barn, each hole rimmed with charred wood. We hope, the creatures thought, it will not be too difficult to make repairs. The Industrialist found it impossible to organize himself to the point of directed thought. He turned to the Astronomer. \"And with that weapon in their possession, they let themselves be handled and caged? I don\u0027t understand it.\" But the calm thought came, We would not harm the young of an intelligent species.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-22.html","bookId":1751,"book":{"id":1751,"title":"The Martian Way and Other Stories","description":"Storyline: This collection of four famous science fiction tales masterfully exemplifies author Isaac Asimov\u0027s ability to create quickly a believable human milieu in the midst of alien circumstances.
