She had not entirely recovered by the time she reached them, running and running. It was minutes before her husband could extract sense from her. She was saying finally, \"I tell you they\u0027re in the barn. I don\u0027t know what they are. No, no-.\" She barred the Industrialist\u0027s quick movement in that direction. She said, \"Don\u0027t you go. Send one of the hands with a Shotgun. I tell you I never saw anything like it. Little horrible beasts with-with- I can\u0027t describe it. To think that Red was touching them and trying to feed them. He was holding them, and feeding them meat.\" Red began, \"I only-\" And Slim said, \"It wasn\u0027t-\" The Industrialist said quickly, \"Now you boys have done enough harm today. March! Into the house! And not a word; not one word! I\u0027m not interested in anything you have to say. After this is all over, I\u0027ll hear you out and as for you, Red, I\u0027ll see that you\u0027re properly punished.\" He turned to his wife, \"Now whatever the animals are, we\u0027ll have them killed.\" He added quietly once the youngsters were out of hearing, \"Come, come. The children aren\u0027t hurt, and after all, they haven\u0027t done anything really terrible. They\u0027ve just found a new pet.\" The Astronomer spoke with difficulty. \"Pardon me, ma\u0027am, but can you describe these animals?\" She shook her head. She was quite beyond words. \"Can you just tell me if they-\" \"I\u0027m sorry,\" said the Industrialist apologetically, \"but I think I had better take care of her. Will you excuse me?\" \"A moment. Please. One moment. She said she had never seen such animals before. Surely it is not usual to find animals that are completely unique on an estate such as this.\" \"I\u0027m sorry. Let\u0027s not discuss that now.\" \"Except that unique animals might have landed during the night.\" The Industrialist stepped away from his wife. \"What are you implying?\" \"I think we had better go to the barn, sir!\" The Industrialist stared a moment, turned, and suddenly and quite uncharacteristically began running. The Astronomer followed and the woman\u0027s wail rose unheeded behind them.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-21.html","bookId":1751,"book":{"id":1751,"title":"The Martian Way and Other Stories","description":"Storyline: This collection of four famous science fiction tales masterfully exemplifies author Isaac Asimov\u0027s ability to create quickly a believable human milieu in the midst of alien circumstances.
