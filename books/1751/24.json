All the remaining seventeen of the crew were dead and their ashes were to be left on a strange planet. Back they would go with a limping ship and the burden of the controls entirely on himself.\n The Merchant said, \"It was a good business stroke, not harming the young ones. We will get very good terms; very good terms.\"\n The Explorer thought, Business!\n The Merchant said, \"They\u0027ve lined up to see us off. All of them.

It would be bad to burn any of them with the rocket blast at this stage of the game.\"\n \"They\u0027re safe.\"\n \"Horrible-looking things, aren\u0027t they?\"\n \"Pleasant enough, inside. Their thoughts are perfectly friendly.\"\n \"You wouldn\u0027t believe it of them. That immature one, the one that first picked us up-\"\n \"They call him Red.\"\n \"That\u0027s a queer name for a monster. Makes me laugh. He actually feels bad that we\u0027re leaving.

The nearest I can come to it is something about a lost opportunity with some organization or other that I can\u0027t quite interpret.\"\n \"A circus,\" said the Explorer briefly.\n \"What?
