Seconds passed while he interpreted his strange surroundings. He wasn\u0027t in his own home, of course. This was out in the country. It was colder than it should be and there was green at the window.\\n\\n \"Slim!\"\\n\\n The call was a hoarse, urgent whisper, and the youngster bounded to she open window.\\n\\n Slim wasn\u0027t his real name, but the new friend he had met the day before had needed only one look at his slight figure to say, \"You\u0027re Slim,\" He added, \"I\u0027m Red.\"\\n\\n Red wasn\u0027t his real name, either, but its appropriateness was obvious. They were friends instantly with the quick, unquestioning friendship of young ones not yet quite in adolescence, before even the first stains of adulthood began to make their appearance.\\n\\n Slim cried, \"Hi, Red!\" and waved cheerfully, still blinking the sleep out of himself.\\n\\n Red kept to his croaking whisper, \"Quiet! You want to wake somebody?\"\\n\\n Slim noticed all at once that the sun scarcely topped the low hills in the east, that the shadows were long and soft, and that the grass was wet\\n\\n Slim said more softly, \"What\u0027s the matter?\"\\n\\n Red only waved for him to come out.\\n\\n Slim dressed quickly, gladly confining his morning wash to the momentary sprinkle of a little lukewarm water. He let the air dry the exposed portions of his body as he ran out, while bare skin grew wet against the dewy grass.\\n\\n Red said, \"You\u0027ve got to be quiet. If Mom wakes up or Dad or your dad or even any of the hands, then it\u0027ll be \u0027Come on in or you\u0027ll catch your death of cold tramping bare in the dew.\u0027\"\\n\\n He mimicked voice and tone faithfully, so that Slim laughed and thought that there had never been so funny a fellow as Red.\\n\\n Slim said eagerly, \"Do you come out here every day like this, Red? Real early? It\u0027s like the whole world is just yours, isn\u0027t it, Red? No one else around, and all like that.\" He felt proud at being allowed entrance into this private world.\\n\\n Red stared at him sidelong. He said carelessly, \"I\u0027ve been up for hours. Didn\u0027t you hear it last night?\"\\n\\n \"Hear what?\"\\n\\n \"Thunder.\"\\n\\n \"Was there a thunderstorm?\" Slim was startled. He never slept through a thunderstorm.\\n\\n \"I guess not. But there was thunder. I heard it, and then I went to the window and it wasn\u0027t raining. It was all stars and the sky was just getting sort of almost gray. You know what I mean?\"\\n\\n Slim had never seen it so, but he nodded.\\n\\n \"So I just thought I\u0027d go out,\" said Red.\\n\\n They walked along the grassy side of the concrete road that split the panorama right down the middle all the way down to where it vanished among the hills. The road was so old that Red\u0027s father couldn\u0027t tell Red when it had been built. It didn\u0027t have a crack or a rough spot in it.\\n\\n Red said, \"Can you keep a secret?\"\\n\\n \"Sure, Red. What kind of a secret?\"\\n\\n \"Just a secret. Maybe I\u0027ll tel you and maybe I won\u0027t. I don\u0027t know yet.\" Red broke a long, supple stem from a fern they passed, methodically stripped it of its leaflets, and swung what was left whip-fashion. For a moment, he was on a wild charger, which reared and champed under his iron control. Then he got tired, tossed the whip aside, and stowed the charger away in a corner of his imagination for future use.\\n\\n He said, \"There\u0027ll be a circus around.\"\\n\\n Slim said, \"That\u0027s no secret. I knew that. My dad told me even before we came here-\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not the secret. Fine secret! Ever see a circus?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, sure. You bet.\"\\n\\n \"Like it?\"\\n\\n \"Say, there isn\u0027t anything I like better.\"\\n\\n Red was watching out of the corner of his eyes again. \"Ever think you would like to be with a circus? I mean, for good?\"\\n\\n Slim considered. \"I guess not. I think I\u0027ll be an astronomer like my dad. I think he wants me to be.\"\\n\\n \"Huh! Astronomer!\" said Red.\\n\\n Slim felt the doors of the new, private world closing on him and astronomy became a thing of dead stars.\\n\\n He said placatingly. \"A circus would be more fun.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re just saying that.\"\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027m not. I mean it.\"\\n\\n Red grew argumentative. \"Suppose you had a chance to join the circus right now. What would you do?\"\\n\\n \"I-I-\"\\n\\n \"See!\" Red affected scornful laughter.\\n\\n Slim was stung. \"I\u0027d join up.\"\\n\\n \"Go on.\"\\n\\n \"Try me.\"\\n\\n Red whirled at him, strange and intense. \"You mean that? You want to go in with me?\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\" Slim stepped back a bit.\\n\\n \"I got something that can get us into the circus. Maybe someday we can even have a circus of our own. We could be the biggest circus fellows in the world. That\u0027s if you want to go in with me. Otherwise-Well, I guess I can do it on my own. I just thought, Let\u0027s give good old Slim a chance.\"\\n\\n The world was strange and glamorous, and Slim said, \"Sure thing, Red. I\u0027m in! What is it, huh, Red? Tell me what it is.\"\\n\\n \"Figure it out. What\u0027s the most important thing in circuses?\"\\n\\n Slim thought desperately. He wanted to give the right answer. Finally he said, \"Acrobats?\"\\n\\n \"Holy smokes! I wouldn\u0027t go five steps to look at acrobats.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know then.\"\\n\\n \"Animals, that\u0027s what! What\u0027s the best side show? Where are the biggest crowds? Even in the main rings the best acts are animal acts.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think so?\"\\n\\n \"Everyone thinks so. You ask anyone. Anyway, I found animals this morning. Two of them.\"\\n\\n \"And you\u0027ve got them?\"\\n\\n \"Sure. That\u0027s the secret. Are you telling?\"\\n\\n \"Of course not\"\\n\\n \"Okay. I\u0027ve got them in the barn. Do you want to see them?\"\\n\\n They were almost at the barn; its huge open door black. Too black. They had been heading there all the time. Slim stopped in his tracks.\\n\\n He tried to make his words casual. \"Are they big?\"\\n\\n \"Would I fool with them if they were big? They can\u0027t hurt you. They\u0027re only about so long. I\u0027ve got them in a cage.\"\\n\\n They were in the barn now and Slim saw the large cage suspended from a hook in the roof. It was covered with stiff canvas.\\n\\n Red said. \"We used to have some bird there or something. Anyway, they can\u0027t get away from there. Come on, let\u0027s go up to the loft.\"\\n\\n They clambered up the wooden stairs and Red hooked the cage toward them.\\n\\n Slim pointed and said, \"There\u0027s sort of a hole in the canvas.\"\\n\\n Red frowned. \"How\u0027d that get there?\" He lifted the canvas, looked in, and said with relief, \"They\u0027re still there.\"\\n\\n \"The canvas looks burned,\" worried Slim. \"You want to look or don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n Slim nodded slowly. He wasn\u0027t sure he wanted to, after all. They might be-\\n\\n But the canvas had been jerked off and there they were. Two of them, the way Red said. They were small and sort of disgusting-looking. The animals moved quickly as the canvas lifted and were on the side toward the youngsters. Red poked a cautious finger at them.\\n\\n \"Watch out,\" said Slim in agony.\\n\\n \"They don\u0027t hurt you,\" said Red. \"Ever see anything like them?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t you see how a circus would jump at a chance to have these?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe they\u0027re too small for a circus.\"\\n\\n Red looked annoyed. He let go the cage which swung back and forth pendulum-fashion. \"You\u0027re just backing out.\"\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027m not. It\u0027s just-.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re not too small, don\u0027t worry. Right now, I\u0027ve only got one worry.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027ve got to keep them till the circus comes, don\u0027t I? I\u0027ve got to figure out what to feed them meanwhile.\"\\n\\n The cage swung and the little trapped creatures clung to its bars, gesturing at the youngsters with queer, quick motions- almost as though they were intelligent. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-12.html","bookId":1751,"book":{"id":1751,"title":"The Martian Way and Other Stories","description":"Storyline: This collection of four famous science fiction tales masterfully exemplifies author Isaac Asimov\u0027s ability to create quickly a believable human milieu in the midst of alien circumstances.
