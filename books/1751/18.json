I never saw such construction.\" \"What good is it now?\" said the Astronomer bitterly. \"There\u0027s nothing left. There\u0027ll be no second landing. This ship detected life on our planet through accident. Other exploring parties would come no closer than necessary to establish the fact there there no super-dense worlds existed in our solar system.\" \"Well, there\u0027s no quarreling with a crash landing.\" \"The ship hardly seems damaged. If only some had survived, the ship might have been repaired.\" \"If they had survived, there would be no trade in any case. They\u0027re too different. Too disturbing. In any case-it\u0027s over.\" They entered the house and the Industrialist greeted his wife calmly. \"Lunch about ready, dear?\" \"I\u0027m afraid not. You see-\" She looked hesitantly at the Astronomer. \"Is anything wrong?\" asked the Industrialist. \"Why not tell me? I\u0027m sure our guest won\u0027t mind a little family discussion.\" \"Pray don\u0027t pay any attention whatever to me,\" muttered the Astronomer. He moved miserably to the other end of the living room. The woman said in low, hurried tones, \"Really, dear, Cook\u0027s that upset. I\u0027ve been soothing her for hours and honestly I don\u0027t know why Red should have done it\" \"Done what?\" The Industrialist was more amused than otherwise. It had taken the united efforts of himself and his son months to argue his wife into using the name \"Red\" rather than the perfectly ridiculous (viewed youngster-fashion) name which was his real one. She said, \"He\u0027s taken most of the chopped meal.\" \"He\u0027s eaten it?\" \"Well, I hope not. It was raw.\" \"Then what would he want it for?\" \"I haven\u0027t the slightest idea. I haven\u0027t seen him since breakfast. Meanwhile Cook\u0027s just furious. She caught him vanishing out the kitchen door and there was the bowl of chopped meat just about empty and she was going to use it for lunch. Well, you know Cook. She had to change the lunch menu and that means she won\u0027t be worth living with for a week. You\u0027ll just have to speak to Red, dear, and make him promise not to do things in the kitchen any more. And it wouldn\u0027t hurt to have him apologize to Cook.\" \"Oh, come. She works for us. If we don\u0027t complain about a change in lunch menu, why should she?\" \"Because she\u0027s the one who has double work made for her, and she\u0027s talking about quitting. Good cooks aren\u0027t easy to get. Do you remember the one before her?\" It was a strong argument. The Industrialist looked about vaguely. He said, \"I suppose you\u0027re right. He isn\u0027t here, I suppose. When he comes in, I\u0027ll talk to him.\" \"You\u0027d better start. Here he comes.\" Red walked into the house and said cheerfully, \"Time for lunch, I guess.\" He looked from one parent to the other in quick speculation at their fixed stares and said, \"Got to clean up, first, though,\" and made for the other door. The Industrialist said, \"One moment, son.\" \"Sir?\" \"Where\u0027s your little friend?\" Red said carelessly, \"He\u0027s around somewhere. We were just sort of walking and I looked around and he wasn\u0027t there.\" This was perfectly true, and Red felt on safe ground. \"I told him it was lunch time. I said, \u0027I suppose it\u0027s about lunch time.\u0027 I said, \u0027We got to be getting back to the house.\u0027 And he said, Yes.\u0027 And I just went on, and then when I was about at the creek, I looked around and-\" The Astronomer interrupted the voluble story, looking up from a magazine he had been sightlessly rummaging through. \"I wouldn\u0027t worry about my youngster. He is quite self-reliant. Don\u0027t wait lunch for him.\" \"Lunch isn\u0027t ready in any case, Doctor.\" The Industrialist turned once more to his son. \"And talking about that, son, the reason for it is that something happened to the ingredients. Do you have anything to say?\" \"Sir?\" \"I hate to feel that I have to explain myself more fully. Why did you take the chopped meat?\" \"The chopped meat?\" \"The chopped meat.\" He waited patiently. Red said, \"Well, I was sort of-\" \"Hungry?\" prompted his father. \"For raw meat?\" \"No, sir. I just sort of needed it.\" \"For what exactly?\" Red looked miserable and remained silent. The Astronomer broke in again. \"If you don\u0027t mind my putting in a few words-you\u0027ll remember that just after breakfast, my son came in to ask what animals ate.\" \"Oh, you\u0027re right. How stupid of me to forget. Look here, Red, did you take it for an animal pet you\u0027ve got?\" Red recovered indignant breath. He said, \"You mean Slim came in here and said I had an animal? He came in here and said that? He said I had an animal?\" \"No, he didn\u0027t. He simply asked what animals ate. That\u0027s all. Now if he promised he wouldn\u0027t tell on you, he didn\u0027t. It\u0027s your own foolishness in trying to take something without permission that gave you away. That happened to be stealing. Now have you an animal? I ask you a direct question.\" \"Yes, sir.\" It was a whisper so low as hardly to be heard. \"All right, you\u0027ll have to get rid of it. Do you understand?\" Red\u0027s mother intervened. \"Do you mean to say you\u0027re keeping a meat-eating animal, Red? It might bite you and give you blood poison.\" \"They\u0027re only small ones,\" quavered Red. \"They hardly budge if you touch them.\" \"They? How many do you have?\" \"Two.\" \"Where are they?\" The Industrialist touched her arm. \"Don\u0027t chivvy the child any further,\" he said in a low voice. \"If he says he\u0027ll get rid of them, he will, and that\u0027s punishment enough.\" He dismissed the matter from his mind.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-18.html","bookId":1751,"book":{"id":1751,"title":"The Martian Way and Other Stories","description":"Storyline: This collection of four famous science fiction tales masterfully exemplifies author Isaac Asimov\u0027s ability to create quickly a believable human milieu in the midst of alien circumstances.
