{"id":71355,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"Captain Follenbee of the Triple G. was a hardheaded man. It was how he habitually thought of himself. He had made government-sponsored runs before. For one thing, they were profitable. The Confederacy didn\u0027t haggle. It meant a complete overhaul of his ship each time, replacement of defective parts, liberal terms for the crew. It was good business. Damned good business.\\n\\n This run, of course, was a little different\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t so much the particular gang of passengers he had taken aboard. (He had expected temperament, tantrums, and unbearable foolishness but it turned out that eggheads were much like normal people.) It wasn\u0027t that half his ship had been torn down and rebuilt into what the contract called a \"universal central-access laboratory.\"\\n\\n Actually, and he hated the thought, it was \"Junior\" -the planet that lay ahead of them.\\n\\n The crew didn\u0027t know, of course, but he, himself, hard head and all, was beginning to find the matter unpleasant.\\n\\n But only beginning-\\n\\n At the moment, he told himself, it was this Mark Annuncio, if that was the name, who was annoying him. He slapped the back of one hand against the palm of the other and thought angrily about it. His large, round face was ruddy with annoyance.\\n\\n Insolence!\\n\\n A boy of not more than twenty, with no position that he knew of among the passengers, to make a request like that.\\n\\n What was behind it? That at least ought to be straightened out.\\n\\n In his present mood, he would like to straighten it out by means of a jacket collar twisted in a fist and a rattle of teeth, but better not-better not-\\n\\n After all, this was a curious kind of flight for the Confederacy of Worlds to sponsor, and a twenty-year-old, overcurious rubberneck might be an integral part of the strangeness. What was he on board for? There was this Dr. Sheffield, for instance, who seemed to have no job but to play nursemaid for the boy. Now why was that? Who was this Annuncio?\\n\\n He had been space-sick for the entire trip, or was that just a device to keep to his cabin-\\n\\n There was a light buzzing as the door signal sounded.\\n\\n It would be the boy.\\n\\n Easy now, thought the Captain. Easy now. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-35.html","bookId":1751,"book":{"id":1751,"title":"The Martian Way and Other Stories","description":"Storyline: This collection of four famous science fiction tales masterfully exemplifies author Isaac Asimov\u0027s ability to create quickly a believable human milieu in the midst of alien circumstances.
