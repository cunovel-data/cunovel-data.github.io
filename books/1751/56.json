{"id":71376,"no":56,"title":"Page 56","content":"It was the jar of the coaster\u0027s landing, Sheffield later thought, that first brought consciousness back. It was a dim, aching sort of thing that had no understanding in it at first.\n The sound of Mark\u0027s voice was floating up to him. That was his first sensation. Then as he tried to roll over and get a knee beneath him, he could feel his head throbbing.\n For a while, Mark\u0027s voice was only a collection of sounds that meant nothing to him. Then they began to coalesce into words. Finally, when his eyes fluttered open and light entered stabbingly so that he had to close them again, he could make out sentences. He remained where he was, head hanging, one quivering knee holding him up.\n Mark was saying in a breathless, high-pitched voice, \"... a thousand people all dead. Just graves. And nobody knows why.\"\n There was a rumble Sheffield couldn\u0027t make out. A hoarse, deep voice.\n Then Mark again, \"It\u0027s true. Why do you suppose all the scientists are aboard?\"\n Sheffield lifted achingly to his feet and rested against one wall. He put his hand to his head and it came away bloody. His hair was caked and matted with it. Groaning, he staggered toward the coaster\u0027s cabin door. He fumbled for the hook and yanked it inward.\n The landing ramp had been lowered. For a moment, he stood there, swaying, afraid to trust his legs.\n He had to take in everything by instalments. Both suns were high in die sky and a thousand feet away the giant steel cylinder of the Triple G. reared its nose high above the runty trees that ringed it.\n Mark was at the foot of the ramp, semi-circled by members of the crew. The crewmen were stripped to the waist and browned nearly black in the ultraviolet of Lagrange I. (Thanks only to the thick atmosphere and the heavy ozone coating in the upper reaches for keeping UV down to a livable range.)\n The crewman directly before Mark was leaning on a baseball bat. Another tossed a ball in the air and caught it. Many of the rest were wearing gloves.\n Funny, thought Sheffield erratically, Mark landed right in the middle of a ball park.\n Mark looked up and saw him. He screamed excitedly, \"All right, \"ask him. Go ahead, ask him. Dr. Sheffield, wasn\u0027t there an expedition to this planet once and they all died mysteriously?\"\n Sheffield tried to say, \"Mark, what are you doing?\" He couldn\u0027t. When he opened his mouth, only a moan came out.\n The crewman with the bat said, \"Is this little gumboil telling the truth, mister?\"\n Sheffield held on to the railing with two perspiring hands. The crewman\u0027s face seemed to waver. The face had thick lips on it and small eyes buried under bristly eyebrows. It wavered very badly.\n Then the ramp came up and whirled about his head. There was ground gripped in his hands suddenly and a cold ache on his cheekbone. He gave up the fight and let go of consciousness again. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-56.html","bookId":1751,"book":{"id":1751,"title":"The Martian Way and Other Stories","description":"Storyline: \n This collection of four famous science fiction tales masterfully exemplifies author Isaac Asimov\u0027s ability to create quickly a believable human milieu in the midst of alien circumstances.
