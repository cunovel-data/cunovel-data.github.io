{"id":71324,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Ted Long found the breadth and height of the city\u0027s main thoroughfare exhilarating. It had been two months since the Commissioner had declared a moratorium on scavenging and had pulled all ships out of space, but this feeling of a stretched-out vista had not stopped thrilling Long. Even the thought that the moratorium was called pending a decision on the part of Earth to enforce its new insistence on water economy, by deciding upon a ration limit for scavenging, did not cast him entirely down.\n The roof of the avenue was painted a luminous light blue, perhaps as an old-fashioned imitation of Earth\u0027s sky. Ted wasn\u0027t sure. The walls were lit with the store windows that pierced it.\n Off in the distance, over the hum of traffic and the sloughing noise of people\u0027s feet passing him, he could hear the intermittent blasting as new channels were being bored into Mars\u0027 crust All his life he remembered such blastings. The ground he walked on had been part of solid, unbroken rock when he was born. The city was growing and would keep on growing-if Earth would only let it.\n He turned off at a cross street, narrower, not quite as brilliantly lit, shop windows giving way to apartment houses, each with its row of lights along the front facade. Shoppers and traffic gave way to slower-paced individuals and to squawling youngsters who had as yet evaded the maternal summons to the evening meal\n At the last minute, Long remembered the social amenities and stopped off at a corner water store.\n He passed over his canteen. \"Fill \u0027er up.\"\n The plump storekeeper unscrewed the cap, cocked an eye into the opening. He shook it a little and let it gurgle. \"Not much left,\" he said cheerfully.\n \"No,\" agreed Long.\n The storekeeper trickled water in, holding the neck of the canteen close to the hose tip to avoid spillage. The volume gauge whirred. He screwed the cap back on.\n Long passed over the coins and took his canteen. It clanked against his hip now with a pleasing heaviness. It would never do to visit a family without a full canteen. Among the boys, it didn\u0027t matter. Not as much, anyway.\n He entered the hallway of No. 27, climbed a short flight of stairs, and paused with his thumb on the signal.\n The sound of voices could be heard quite plainly.\n One was a woman\u0027s voice, somewhat shrill. \"It\u0027s all right for you to have your Scavenger friends here, isn\u0027t it? I\u0027m supposed to be thankful you managed to get home two months a year. Oh, it\u0027s quite enough that you spend a day or two with me. After that, it\u0027s the Scavengers again.\"\n \"I\u0027ve been home for a long time now,\" said a male voice, \"and this is business. For Mars\u0027 sake, let up, Dora. They\u0027ll be here soon.\"\n Long decided to wait a moment before signaling. It might give them a chance to hit a more neutral topic.\n \"What do I care if they come?\" retorted Dora. \"Let them hear me. And I\u0027d just as soon the Commissioner kept the moratorium on permanently. You hear me?\"\n \"And what would we live on?\" came the male voice hotly. \"You tell me that.\"\n \"I\u0027ll tell you. You can make a decent, honorable living right here on Mars, just like everybody else. I\u0027m the only one in this apartment house that\u0027s a Scavenger widow. That\u0027s what I am- a widow. I\u0027m worse than a widow, because if I were a widow, I\u0027d at least have a chance to many someone else-What did you say?\"\n \"\u0027Nothing. Nothing at all.\"\n \"Oh, I know what you said. Now listen here, Dick Swenson-\"\n \"I only said,\" cried Swenson, \"that now I know why Scavengers usually don\u0027t marry.\"\n \"You shouldn\u0027t have either. I\u0027m tired of having every person in the neighborhood pity me and smirk and ask when you\u0027re coming home. Other people can be mining engineers and administrators and even tunnel borers. At least tunnel borers\u0027 wives have a decent home life and their children don\u0027t grow up like vagabonds. Peter might as well not have a father-.\"\n A thin boy-soprano voice made its way through the door. It was somewhat more distant, as though it were in another room. \"Hey, Mom, what\u0027s a vagabond?\"\n Dora\u0027s voice rose a notch. \"Peter! You keep your mind on your homework.\"\n Swenson said in a low voice, \"It\u0027s not right to talk this way in front of the kid. What kind of notions will he get about me?\"\n \"Stay home then and teach him better notions.\"\n Peter\u0027s voice called out again. \"Hey, Mom, I\u0027m going to be a Scavenger when I grow up.\"\n Footsteps sounded rapidly. There was a momentary hiatus in the sounds, then a piercing, \"Mom! Hey, Mom! Leggo my ear! What did I do?\" and a snuffling silence.\n Long seized the chance. He worked the signal vigorously.\n Swenson opened the door, brushing down his hair with both hands.\n \"Hello, Ted,\" he said in a subdued voice. Then loudly, \"Ted\u0027s here, Dora. Where\u0027s Mario, Ted?\"\n Long said, \"He\u0027ll be here in a while.\"\n Dora came bustling out of the next room, a small, dark woman with a pinched nose, and hair, just beginning to show touches of gray, combed off the forehead.\n \"Hello, Ted. Have you eaten?\"\n \"Quite well, thanks. I haven\u0027t interrupted you, have I?\"\n \"Not at all. We finished ages ago. Would you like some coffee?\"\n \"I think so.\" Ted unslung his canteen and offered it.\n \"Oh, goodness, that\u0027s all right. We\u0027ve plenty of water.\"\n \"I insist.\"\n \"Well, then-.\"\n Back into the kitchen she went. Through the swinging door, Long caught a glimpse of dishes sitting in Secoterg, the \"waterless cleaner that soaks up and absorbs grease and dirt in a twinkling. One ounce of water will rinse eight square feet of dish surface clean as clean. Buy Secoterg. Secoterg just cleans it right, makes your dishes shiny bright, does away with water waste-.\"\n The tune started whining through his mind and Long crushed it with speech. He said, \"How\u0027s Pete?\"\n \"Fine, fine. The kid\u0027s in the fourth grade now. You know I don\u0027t get to see him much. Well, sir, when I came back last time, he looked at me and said...\"\n It went on for a while and wasn\u0027t too bad as bright sayings of bright children as told by dull parents go.\n The door signal burped and Mario Rioz came in, frowning and red.\n Swenson stepped to him quickly. \"Listen, don\u0027t say anything about shell-snaring. Dora still remembers the time you fingered a Class A shell out of my territory and she\u0027s in one of her moods now.\"\n \"Who the hell wants to talk about shells?\" Rioz slung off a fur-lined jacket, threw it over the back of the chair, and sat down.\n Dora came through the swinging door, viewed the newcomer with a synthetic smile, and said, \"Hello, Mario. Coffee for you, too?\"\n \"Yeah,\" he said, reaching automatically for his canteen.\n \"Just use some more of my water, Dora,\" said Long quickly. \"He\u0027ll owe- it to me.\"\n \"Yeah,\" said Rioz.\n \"What\u0027s wrong, Mario?\" asked Long.\n Rioz said heavily, \"Go on. Say you told me so. A year ago when Hilder made that speech, you told me so. Say it.\"\n Long shrugged.\n Rioz said, \"They\u0027ve set up the quota. Fifteen minutes ago the news came out.\"\n \"Well?\"\n \"Fifty thousands tons of water per trip.\"\n \"What?\" yelled Swenson, burning. \"You can\u0027t get off Mars with fifty thousand!\"\n \"That\u0027s the figure. It\u0027s a deliberate piece of gutting. No more scavenging.\"\n Dora came out with the coffee and set it down all around.\n \"What\u0027s all this about no more scavenging?\" She sat down very firmly and Swenson looked helpless.\n \"It seems,\" said Long, \"that they\u0027re rationing us at fifty thousand tons and that means we can\u0027t make any more trips.\"\n \"Well, what of it?\" Dora sipped her coffee and smiled gaily. \"If you want my opinion, it\u0027s a good thing. It\u0027s time all you Scavengers found yourselves a nice, steady job here on Mars. I mean it. It\u0027s no life to be running all over space-.\"\n \"Please, Dora,\" said Swenson.\n Rioz came close to a snort\n Dora raised her eyebrows. \"I\u0027m just giving my opinions.\"\n Long said, \"Please feel free to do so. But I would like to say something. Fifty thousand is just a detail. We know that Earth -or at least Hilder\u0027s party-wants to make political capital out of a campaign for water economy, so we\u0027re in a bad hole. We\u0027ve got to get water somehow or they\u0027ll shut us down altogether, right?\"\n \"Well, sure,\" said Swenson.\n \"But the question is how, right?\"\n \"If it\u0027s only getting water,\" said Rioz in a sudden gush of words, \"there\u0027s only one thing to do and you know it. If the Grounders won\u0027t give us water, we\u0027ll take it. The water doesn\u0027t belong to them just because their fathers and grandfathers were too damned sick-yellow ever to leave their fat planet. Water belongs to people wherever they are. We\u0027re people and the water\u0027s ours, too. We have a right to it.\"\n \"How do you propose taking it?\" asked Long.\n \"Easy! They\u0027ve got oceans of water on Earth. They can\u0027t post a guard over every square mile. We can sink down on the night side of the planet any time we want, fill our shells, then get away. How can they stop us?\"\n \"In half a dozen ways, Mario. How do you spot shells in space up to distances of a hundred thousand miles? One thin metal shell in all that space. How? By radar. Do you think there\u0027s no radar on Earth? Do you think that if Earth ever gets the notion we\u0027re engaged in waterlegging, it won\u0027t be simple for them to set up a radar network to spot ships coming in from space?\"\n Dora broke in indignantly. \"I\u0027ll tell you one thing, Mario Rioz. My husband isn\u0027t going to be part of any raid to get water to keep up his scavenging with.\"\n \"It isn\u0027t just scavenging,\" said Mario. \"Next they\u0027ll be cutting down on everything else. We\u0027ve got to stop them now.\"\n \"But we don\u0027t need their water anyway,\" said Dora. \"We\u0027re not the Moon or Venus. We pipe enough water down from the polar caps for all we need. We have a water tap right in this apartment. There\u0027s one in every apartment on this block.\"\n Long said, \"Home use is the smallest pan of it. The mines use water. And what do we do about the hydroponic tanks?\"\n \"That\u0027s right,\" said Swenson. \"What about the hydroponic tanks, Dora? They\u0027ve got to have water and it\u0027s about time we arranged to grow our own fresh food instead of having to live on the condensed crud they ship us from Earth.\"\n \"Listen to him,\" said Dora scornfully. \"What do you know about fresh food? You\u0027ve never eaten any.\"\n \"I\u0027ve eaten more than you think. Do you remember those carrots I picked up once?\"\n \"Well, what was so wonderful about them? If you ask me, good baked protomeal is much better. And healthier, too. It just seems to be the fashion now to be talking fresh vegetables because they\u0027re increasing taxes for these hydroponics. Besides, all this will blow over.\"\n Long said, \"I don\u0027t think so. Not by itself, anyway. Hilder will probably be the next Co-ordinator, and then things may really get bad. If they cut down on food shipments, too-.\"\n \"Well, then,\" shouted Rioz, \"what do we do? I still say take it! Take the water!\"\n \"And I say we can\u0027t do that, Mario. Don\u0027t you see that what you\u0027re suggesting is the Earth way, the Grounder way? You\u0027re trying to hold on to the umbilical cord that ties Mars to Earth.\n Can\u0027t you get away from that? Can\u0027t you see the Martian way?\"\n \"No, I can\u0027t. Suppose you tell me.\"\n \"I will, if you\u0027ll listen. When we think about the Solar System, what do we think about? Mercury, Venus, Earth, Moon, Mars, Phobos, and Deimos. There you are-seven bodies, that\u0027s all. But that doesn\u0027t represent 1 per cent of the Solar System. We Martians are right at the edge of the other 99 per cent. Out there, farther from the Sun, there\u0027s unbelievable amounts of water!\",\n The others stared.\n Swenson said uncertainly. \"You mean the layers of ice on Jupiter and Saturn?\"\n \"Not that specifically, but it is water, you\u0027ll admit. A thousand-mile-thick layer of water is a lot of water.\"\n \"But it\u0027s all covered up with layers of ammonia or-or something, isn\u0027t it?\" asked Swenson. \"Besides, we can\u0027t land on the major planets.\"\n \"I know that,\" said Long, \"but I haven\u0027t said that was the answer. The major planets aren\u0027t the only objects out there. What about the asteroids and the satellites? Vesta is a two-hundred-mile-diameter asteroid that\u0027s hardly mare than a chunk of ice. One of the moons of Saturn is mostly ice. How about that?\"\n Rioz said, \"Haven\u0027t you ever been in space, Ted?\"\n \"You know I have. Why do you ask?\"\n \"Sure, I know you have, but you still talk like a Grounder. Have you thought of the distances involved? The average asteroid is a hundred twenty million miles from Mars at the closest. That\u0027s twice the Venus-Mars hop and you know that hardly any liners do even that in one jump. They usually stop off at Earth or the Moon. After all, how long do you expect anyone to stay in space, man?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. What\u0027s your limit?\"\n \"You know the limit. You don\u0027t have to ask me. It\u0027s six months. That\u0027s handbook data. After six months, if you\u0027re still in space, you\u0027re psychotherapy meat. Right, Dick?\"\n Swenson nodded.\n \"And that\u0027s just the asteroids,\" Rioz went on. \"From Mars to Jupiter is three hundred thirty million miles, and to Saturn it\u0027s seven hundred million. How can anyone handle that kind of distance? Suppose you hit standard velocity, or, to make it even, say you get up to a good two hundred kilomiles an hour. It would take you-let\u0027s see, allowing time for acceleration and deceleration-about six or seven months to get to Jupiter and nearly a year to get to Saturn. Of course, you could hike the speed to a million miles an hour, theoretically, but where would you get the water to do that?\"\n \"Gee,\" said a small voice attached to a smutty nose and round eyes. \"Saturn!\"\n Dora whirled in her chair. \"Peter, march right back into your room!\"\n \"Aw, Ma.\"\n \"Don\u0027t \u0027Aw, Ma\u0027 me.\" She began to get out of the chair, and Peter scuttled away.\n Swenson said, \"Say, Dora, why don\u0027t you keep him company for a while? It\u0027s hard to keep his mind on homework if we\u0027re all out here talking.\"\n Dora sniffed obstinately and stayed put. \"I\u0027ll sit right here until I find out what Ted Long is thinking of. I tell you right now I don\u0027t like the sound of it.\"\n Swenson said nervously, \"Well, never mind Jupiter and Saturn. I\u0027m sure Ted isn\u0027t figuring on that. But what about Vesta? We could make it in ten or twelve weeks there and the same back. And two hundreds miles in diameter. That\u0027s four million cubic miles of ice!\"\n \"So what?\" said Rioz. \"What do we do on Vesta? Quarry the ice? Set up mining machinery? Say, do you know how long that would take?\"\n Long said, \"I\u0027m talking about Saturn, not Vesta.\"\n Rioz addressed an unseen audience. \"I tell him seven hundred million miles and he keeps on talking.\"\n \"All right,\" said Long, \"suppose you tell me how you know we can only stay in space six months, Mario?\"\n \"It\u0027s common knowledge, damn it.\"\n \"Because it\u0027s in the Handbook of Space Flight. It\u0027s data compiled by Earth scientists from experience with Earth pilots and spacemen. You\u0027re still thinking Grounder style. You won\u0027t think the Martian way.\"\n \"A Martian may be a Martian, but he\u0027s still a man.\"\n \"But how can you be so blind? How many times have you fellows been out for over six months without a break?\"\n Rioz said, \"That\u0027s different.\"\n \"Because you\u0027re Martians? Because you\u0027re professional Scavengers?\"\n \"No. Because we\u0027re not on a flight. We can put back for Mars any time we want to.\"\n \"But you don\u0027t want to. That\u0027s my point. Earthmen have tremendous ships with libraries of films, with a crew of fifteen plus passengers. Still, they can only stay out six months maximum. Martian Scavengers have a two-room ship with only one partner. But we can stick it out more than six months.\"\n Dora said, \"I suppose you want to stay in a ship for a year and go to Saturn.\"\n \"Why not, Dora?\" said Long. \"We can do it. Don\u0027t you see we can? Earthmen can\u0027t. They\u0027ve got a real world. They\u0027ve got open sky and fresh food, all the air and water they want. Getting into a ship is a terrible change for them. More than six months is too much for them for that very reason. Martians are different. We\u0027ve been living on a ship our entire lives.\n \"That\u0027s all Mars is-a ship. It\u0027s just a big ship forty-five hundred miles across with one tiny room in it occupied by fifty thousand people. It\u0027s closed in like a ship. We breathe packaged air and drink packaged water, which we repurify over and over. We eat the same food rations we eat aboard ship. When we get into a ship, it\u0027s the same thing we\u0027ve known all our lives. We can stand it for a lot more than a year if we have to.\"\n Dora said, \"Dick, too?\"\n \"We all can.\"\n \"Well, Dick can\u0027t. It\u0027s all very well for you, Ted Long, and this shell stealer here, this Mario to talk about jaunting off for a year. You\u0027re not married. Dick is. He has a wife and he has a child and that\u0027s enough for him. He can just get a regular job right here on Mars. Why, my goodness, suppose you go to Saturn and find there\u0027s no water there. How\u0027ll you get back? Even if you had water left, you\u0027d be out of food. It\u0027s the most ridiculous thing I ever heard of.\"\n \"No. Now listen,\" said Long tightly. \"I\u0027ve thought this thing out. I\u0027ve talked to Commissioner Sankov and he\u0027ll help. But we\u0027ve got to have ships and men. I can\u0027t get them. The men won\u0027t listen to me. I\u0027m green. You two are known and respected. You\u0027re veterans. If you back me, even if you don\u0027t go yourselves, if you\u0027ll just help me sell this thing to the rest, get volunteers-.\"\n \"First,\" said Rioz grumpily, \u0027you\u0027ll have to do a lot more explaining. Once we get to Saturn, Where\u0027s the water?\"\n \"That\u0027s the beauty of it,\" said Long. \"That\u0027s why it\u0027s got to be Saturn. The water there is just floating around in space for the taking.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-4.html","bookId":1751,"book":{"id":1751,"title":"The Martian Way and Other Stories","description":"Storyline: \n This collection of four famous science fiction tales masterfully exemplifies author Isaac Asimov\u0027s ability to create quickly a believable human milieu in the midst of alien circumstances.
