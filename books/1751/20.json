Their eyes, which were neutral little objects before, now seemed to watch them with active malevolence. \"They\u0027re making noises,\" said Slim in a whisper. \"I guess they\u0027re talking or something,\" said Red. Funny that those noises which they had heard before had not had significance earlier. He was making no move toward them. Neither was Slim. The canvas was off but they were just watching. The ground meat, Slim noticed, hadn\u0027t been touched. Slim said, \"Aren\u0027t you going to do something?\" \"Aren\u0027t you?\" \"You found them.\" \"It\u0027s your turn now.\" \"No, it isn\u0027t. You found them. It\u0027s your fault, the whole thing. I was just watching.\" \"You joined in, Slim. You know you did.\" \"I don\u0027t care. You found them and that\u0027s what I\u0027ll say when they come here looking for us.\" Red said, \"All right for you.\" But the thought of the consequences inspired him anyway, and he reached for the cage door. Slim said, \"Wait!\" Red was glad to. He said, \"Now what\u0027s biting you?\" \"One of them\u0027s got something on him that looks like it might be iron or something.\" \"Where?\" \"Right there. I saw it before but I thought it was just part of him. But if he\u0027s \u0027people,\u0027 maybe it\u0027s a disintegrator gun.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" \"I read about it in the books from Beforethewars. Mostly people with spaceships have disintegrator guns. They point them at you and you get disintegratored.\" \"They didn\u0027t point it at us till now,\" pointed out Red with his heart not quite in it. \"I don\u0027t care. I\u0027m not hanging around here and getting disintegratored. I\u0027m getting my father.\" \"Cowardy-cat. Yellow cowardy-cat.\" \"I don\u0027t care. You can call all the names you want, but if you bother them now, you\u0027ll get disintegratored. You wait and see, and it\u0027ll be all your fault.\" He made for the narrow spiral stairs that led to the main floor of the barn, stopped at its head, then backed away. Red\u0027s mother was moving up, panting a little with the exertion and smiling a tight smile for the benefit of Slim in his capacity as guest. \"Red! You, Red! Are you up there? Now don\u0027t try to hide. I know this is where you\u0027re keeping them. Cook saw where you ran with the meat.\" Red quavered, \"Hello, Ma!\" \"Now show me those nasty animals. I\u0027m going to see to it that you get rid of them right away.\" It was over! And despite the imminent corporal punishment, Red felt something like a load fall from him. At least the decision was out of his hands. \"Right there, Ma. I didn\u0027t do anything to them, Ma. I didn\u0027t know. They just looked like little animals and I thought you\u0027d let me keep them, Ma. I wouldn\u0027t have taken the meat only they wouldn\u0027t eat grass or leaves and we couldn\u0027t find good nuts or berries and Cook never lets me have anything or I would. have asked her and I didn\u0027t know it was for lunch and:-\" He was speaking on the sheer momentum of terror and did not realize that his mother did not hear him but, with eyes frozen and popping at the cage, was screaming in thin, piercing tones.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-20.html","bookId":1751,"book":{"id":1751,"title":"The Martian Way and Other Stories","description":"Storyline: This collection of four famous science fiction tales masterfully exemplifies author Isaac Asimov\u0027s ability to create quickly a believable human milieu in the midst of alien circumstances.
