Long tried a touch clockwise, then a touch counter. The picture was lousy.\\n\\n Rioz knew it would stay lousy. They were too far from Earth and at a bad position facing the Sun. But then Long would not be expected to know that. Rioz remained standing in the doorway for an additional moment, head bent to clear the upper lintel, body turned half sidewise to fit the narrow opening. Then he jerked into the galley like a cork popping out of a bottle.\\n\\n \"What are you after?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"I thought I\u0027d get Hilder,\" said Long.\\n\\n Rioz propped his rump on the corner of a table shelf. He lifted a conical can of milk from the companion shelf just above his head. Its point popped under pressure. He swirled it gently as he waited for it to warm.\\n\\n \"What for?\" he said. He upended the cone and sucked noisily.\\n\\n \"Thought I\u0027d listen.\"\\n\\n \"I think it\u0027s a waste of power.\"\\n\\n Long looked up, frowning. \"It\u0027s customary to allow free use of personal video sets.\"\\n\\n \"Within reason,\" retorted Rioz.\\n\\n Their eyes met challengingly. Rioz had the rangy body, the gaunt, cheek-sunken face that was almost the hallmark of the Martian Scavenger, those Spacers who patiently haunted the space routes between Earth and Mars. Pale blue eyes were set keenly in the brown, lined face which, in turn, stood darkly out against the white surrounding syntho-fur that lined the up-turned collar of his leathtic space jacket\\n\\n Long was altogether paler and softer. He bore some of the marks of the Grounder, although no second-generation Martian could be a Grounder in the sense that Earthmen were. His own collar was thrown back and his dark brown hair freely exposed.\\n\\n \"What do you call -within reason?\" demanded Long.\\n\\n Rioz\u0027s thin lips grew thinner. He said, \"Considering that we\u0027re not even going to make expenses this trip, the way it looks, any power drain at all is outside reason.\"\\n\\n Long said, \"If we\u0027re losing money, hadn\u0027t you better get back to your post? It\u0027s your watch.\"\\n\\n Rioz grunted and ran a thumb and forefinger over the stubble on his chin. He got up and trudged to the door, his soft, heavy boots muting the sound of his steps. He paused to look at the thermostat, then turned with a flare of fury.\\n\\n \"I thought it was hot. Where do you think, you are?\"\\n\\n Long said, \"Forty degrees isn\u0027t excessive.\"\\n\\n \"For you it isn\u0027t, maybe. But this is space, not a heated office at the iron mines.\" Rioz swung the thermostat control down to a minimum with a quick thumb movement. \"Sun\u0027s warm enough.\"\\n\\n \"The galley isn\u0027t on Sunside.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027ll percolate through, damn it.\"\\n\\n Rioz stepped through the door and Long stared after him for a long moment, then turned back to the video. He did not turn up the thermostat.\\n\\n The picture was still flickering badly, but it would have to do. Long folded a chair down out of the wall. He leaned forward waiting through the formal announcement, the momentary pause before the slow dissolution of the curtain, the spotlight picking out the well-known bearded figure which grew as it was brought forward until it filled the screen.\\n\\n The voice, impressive even through the flutings and croakings induced by the electron storms of twenty millions of miles, began:\\n\\n \"Friends! My fellow citizens of Earth...\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-1.html","bookId":1751,"book":{"id":1751,"title":"The Martian Way and Other Stories","description":"Storyline: This collection of four famous science fiction tales masterfully exemplifies author Isaac Asimov\u0027s ability to create quickly a believable human milieu in the midst of alien circumstances.
