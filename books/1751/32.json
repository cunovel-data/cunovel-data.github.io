Walter was still whimpering.\n The stewardess said, \"Shall I change him for you? He\u0027s quite wet.\"\n \"Would you please?\"\n Most of the nearer passengers had returned to their seats. The more distant ceased craning their necks.\n Mr. Ellis remained in the aisle with his wife. He said, \"Say, look.\"\n Laura and the stewardess were too busy to pay him attention and Mrs. Ellis ignored him out of sheer custom.\n Mr. Ellis was used to that. His remark was purely rhetorical, anyway. He bent down and tugged at die box beneath the seat\n Mrs. Ellis looked down impatiently. She said, \"Goodness, George, don\u0027t be dragging at other people\u0027s luggage like that. Sit down. You\u0027re in the way.\"\n Mr. Ellis straightened in confusion.\n Laura, with eyes still red and weepy, said, \"It isn\u0027t mine. I didn\u0027t even know it was under the seat.\"\n The stewardess, looking up from the whining baby, said, \"What is it?\"\n Mr. Ellis shrugged. \"It\u0027s a box.\"\n His wife said, \"Well, what do you want with it, for heaven\u0027s sake?\"\n Mr. Ellis groped for a reason. What did he want with it? He mumbled, \"I was just curious.\"\n The stewardess said, \"There! The little boy is all nice and dry, and I\u0027ll bet in two minutes he\u0027ll just be as happy as anything. Hmm? Won\u0027t you, little funny-face?\"\n But little funny-face was still sobbing. He turned his head away sharply as a bottle was once more produced.\n The stewardess said, \"Let me warm it a bit\"\n She took it and went back down the aisle.\n Mr. Ellis came to a decision. Firmly he lifted the box and balanced it on the arm of his seat. He ignored his wife\u0027s frown.\n He said, \"I\u0027m not doing it any harm. I\u0027m just looking. What\u0027s it made of, anyway?\"\n He rapped it with his knuckles. None of the other passengers seemed interested. They paid no attention to either Mr. Ellis or the box. It was as though something had switched off that particular line of interest among them. Even Mrs. Ellis, in conversation witih Laura, kept her back to him.\n Mr. Ellis tipped the box up and found the opening. He knew it had to have an opening. It was large enough for him to insert a finger, though there was no reason, of course, why he should want to put a finger into a strange box.\n Carefully he reached in. There was a black knob, which he longed to touch. He pressed it.\n The box shuddered and was suddenly out of his hands and passed through the arm of the chair.\n He caught a glimpse of it moving through the floor, and then there was unbroken flooring and nothing more. Slowly he spread out his hands and stared at his palms. Then, dropping to his knees, he felt the floor.\n The stewardess, returning with the bottle, said politely, \"Have you lost something, sir?\"\n Mrs. Ellis, looking down, said, \"George!\"\n Mr. Ellis heaved himself upward. He was flushed and flustered. He said, \"The box-It slipped out and went down-\"\n The stewardess said, \"What box, sir?\"\n Laura said, \"May I have the bottle, miss? He\u0027s stopped crying.\"\n \"Certainly. Here it is.\"\n Walter opened his mouth eagerly, accepting the nipple. Air bubbles moved upward through the milk and there were little swallowing sounds.\n Laura looked up radiantly. \"He seems fine now. Thank you, Stewardess. Thank you, Mrs. Ellis. For a while there, it almost seemed as though he weren\u0027t my little boy.\"\n \"He\u0027ll be all right,\" said Mrs. Ellis. \"Maybe it was just a bit of airsickness. Sit down, George.\"\n The stewardess said, \"Just call me if you need me.\"\n \"Thank you,\" said Laura.\n Mr. Ells said, \"The box-\" and stopped.\n What box? He didn\u0027t remember any box. But one mind aboard plane could follow the black cube as it dropped in a parabola unimpeded by wind or air resistance, passing through the molecules of gas that lay in its way. Below it, the atoll was a tiny bull\u0027s eye in a huge target.\n Once, during a time of war, it had boasted an air strip and barracks. The barracks had collapsed, the air strip was a vanishing ragged line, and the atoll was empty.\n The cube struck the feathery foliage of a palm and not a frond was disturbed. It passed through the trunk and down to the coral. It sank into the planet itself without the smallest fog of dust kicked up to tell of its entrance.\n Twenty feet below the surface of the soil, the cube passed into statis and remained motionless, mingled intimately with the atoms of the rock, yet remaining distinct.\n That was all. It was night, then day. It rained, the wind blew, and the Pacific waves broke whitely on the white coral. Nothing had happened.\n Nothing would happen-for ten years. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-32.html","bookId":1751,"book":{"id":1751,"title":"The Martian Way and Other Stories","description":"Storyline: \n This collection of four famous science fiction tales masterfully exemplifies author Isaac Asimov\u0027s ability to create quickly a believable human milieu in the midst of alien circumstances.
