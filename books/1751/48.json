I\u0027ll swear to that.\"\n \"Maybe so,\" said Rodriguez at once, \"but can you explain how? It\u0027s impossible. I tell you that and I tell you. See here. Almost all Earth-type planets give birth to life and that life is always protein in nature and always either cellular or virus in organization. But that\u0027s all. There the resemblance ends.\n \"You laymen think it\u0027s all the same; Earth or any planet. Germs are germs and viruses are viruses. I tell you you don\u0027t understand the infinite possibilities for variation in the protein molecule. Even on Earth, every species has its own diseases. Some may spread over several species but there isn\u0027t one single pathogenic life form of any type on Earth that can attack all other species.\n \"You think that a virus or a bacterium developing independently for a billion yeans on another planet with different amino acids, different enzyme systems, a different scheme of metabolism altogether is just going to happen to find Homo sapiens succulent like a lollipop. I tell you it is childishness.\"\n Novee, his physician\u0027s soul badly pierced at having been lumped under the phrase, \"You laymen,\" was not disposed to let it go that easily, \"Homo sapiens brings its own germs with it wherever it goes, Rod. Who\u0027s to say the virus of the common cold didn\u0027t mutate under some planetary influence into something that was suddenly deadly? Or influenza. Things like have happened even on Earth. The 2755 para-meas-\"\n \"I know all about the 2755 para-measles epidemic,\" said Rodriguez, \"and the 1918 influenza epidemic, and the Black Death, too. But when has it happened lately? Granted the settlement was a matter of a century and more ago-still that wasn\u0027t exactly pre-atomic times, either. They included doctors. They had supplies of antibiotics and for space\u0027 sake, they knew the techniques of antibody induction. They\u0027re simple enough. And there was the medical relief expedition, too.\"\n Novee patted his round abdomen and said stubbornly, \"The symptoms were those of a respiratory infection; dyspnea-\"\n \"I know the list, but I tell you it wasn\u0027t a germ disease that got them. It couldn\u0027t be.\"\n \"What was it, then?\"\n \"That\u0027s outside my professional competence. Talking from inside, I tell you it wasn\u0027t infection. Even mutant infection. It couldn\u0027t be. It mathematically couldn\u0027t be.\" He leaned heavily on the adverb.\n There was a stir among his listeners as Mark Annuncio shoved his thin body forward into the space immediately before Rodriguez.\n For the first time, he spoke at one of these gatherings.\n \"Mathematically?\" he asked eagerly.\n Sheffield followed after, his long body all elbows and knees as he made a path. He murmured \"Sorry\" half a dozen times.\n Rodriguez, in an advanced stage of exasperation, thrust out his lower lip and said, \"What do you want?\"\n Mark flinched. Less eagerly, he said, \"You said you knew it wasn\u0027t infection mathematically. I was wondering how-mathematics...\" He ran down.\n Rodriguez said, \"I have stated my professional opinion.\" He said it formally, stiltedly, then turned away. No man questioned another\u0027s professional opinion unless he was of the same specialty. Otherwise the implication, clearly enough, was that the specialist\u0027s experience and knowledge was sufficiently dubious to be brought into question by an outsider. Mark knew this, but then he was of the Mnemonic Service.\n He tapped Rodriguez\u0027s shoulder, while the others standing about listened in stunned fascination, and said, \"I know it\u0027s your professional opinion, but still I\u0027d like to have it explained.\"\n He didn\u0027t mean to sound peremptory. He was just stating a fact.\n Rodriguez whirled. \"You\u0027d like to have it explained? Who the eternal Universe are you to ask me questions?\"\n Mark was startled at the other\u0027s vehemence, but Sheffield had reached him now, and he gained courage. With it, anger.\n He disregarded Sheffield\u0027s quick whisper and said shrilly, \"I\u0027m Mark Annuncio of Mnemonic Service and I\u0027ve asked you a question. I want your statement explained.\"\n \"It won\u0027t be explained. Sheffield, take this young nut out of here and tuck him into bed, will you? And keep him away from me after this. Damn young jackass.\" The last was a clearly heard aside.\n Sheffield took Mark\u0027s wrist but it was wrenched out of his grasp. The young Mnemonic screamed, \"You stupid non-compos. You-you moron. You forgettery on two feet. Sieve-mind. Let me go, Dr. Sheffield-You\u0027re no expert. You don\u0027t remember anything you\u0027ve learned, and you haven\u0027t learned much in the first place. You\u0027re not a specialist; none of you-\"\n \"For space\u0027 sake,\" cried Cimon, \"take the young idiot out of here, Sheffield.\"\n Sheffield, his long cheeks burning, stooped and lifted Mark bodily into the air. Holding him close, he made his way out of the room.\n Tears squeezed out of Mark\u0027s eyes, and just outside the door, he managed to speak with difficulty. \"Let me down. I want to hear-I want to hear what they say.\"\n Sheffield said, \"Don\u0027t go back in. Please, Mark.\"\n \"I won\u0027t. Don\u0027t worry. But-\"\n He didn\u0027t finish the but. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-48.html","bookId":1751,"book":{"id":1751,"title":"The Martian Way and Other Stories","description":"Storyline: \n This collection of four famous science fiction tales masterfully exemplifies author Isaac Asimov\u0027s ability to create quickly a believable human milieu in the midst of alien circumstances.
