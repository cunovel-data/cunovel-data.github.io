Each day it flashed over a length of space it had taken nine days outward. Ted Long had put the entire crew on emergency. With twenty-five ships embedded in the planetoid taken out of Saturn\u0027s rings and unable to move or maneuver independently, the co-ordination of their power source into unified blasts was a ticklish problem. The jarring that took place on the first day of travel nearly shook them out from under their hair. That, at least, smoothed itself out as the velocity raced upward under the steady thrust from behind. They passed the one-hundred-thousand-mile-an-hour mark late on the second day, and climbed steadily toward the million-mile mark and beyond. Long\u0027s ship, which formed the needle point of the frozen fleet, was the only one which possessed a five-way view of space. It was an uncomfortable position under the circumstances. Long found himself watching tensely, imagining somehow that the stars would slowly begin to slip backward, to whizz past them, under the influence of the multi-ship\u0027s tremendous rate of travel. They didn\u0027t, of course. They remained nailed to the black backdrop, their distance scorning with patient immobility any speed mere man could achieve. The men complained bitterly after the first few days. It was not only that they were deprived of the space-float. They were burdened by much more than the ordinary pseudo-gravity field of the ships, by the effects of the fierce acceleration under which they were living. Long himself was weary to death of the relentless pressure against hydraulic cushions. They took to shutting off the jets thrusts one hour out of every four and Long fretted. It had been just over a year that he had last seen Mars shrinking in an observation window from this ship, which had then been an independent entity. What had happened since then? Was the colony still there? In something like a growing panic, Long sent out radio pulses toward Mars daily, with the combined power of twenty-five ships behind it. There was no answer. He expected none. Mars and Saturn were on opposite sides of the Sun now, and until he mounted high enough above the ecliptic to get the Sun well beyond the line connecting himself and Mars, solar interference would prevent any signal from getting through. High above the outer rim of the Asteroid Belt, they reached maximum velocity. With short spurts of power from first one side jet, then another, the huge vessel reversed itself. The composite jet in the rear began its mighty roaring once again, but now the result was deceleration. They passed a hundred million miles over the Sun, curving down to intersect the orbit of Mars. A week out of Mars, answering signals were heard for the first time, fragmentary, ether-torn, and incomprehensible, but they were coming from Mars. Earth and Venus were at angles sufficiently different to leave no doubt of that Long relaxed. There were still humans on Mars, at any rate. Two days out of Mars, the signal was strong and dear and Sankov was at the other end. Sankov said, \"Hello, son. It\u0027s three in the morning here. Seems like people have no consideration for an old man. Dragged me right out of bed.\" \"I\u0027m sorry, sir.\" \"Don\u0027t be. They were following orders. I\u0027m afraid to ask, son. Anyone hurt? Maybe dead?\" \"No deaths, sir. Not one.\" \"And-and the water? Any left?\" Long said, with an effort at nonchalance, \"Enough.\" \"In that case, get home as fast as you can. Don\u0027t take any chances, of course.\" \"There\u0027s trouble, then.\" \"Fair to middling. When will you come down?\" \"Two days. Can you hold out that long?\" \"Ill hold out.\" Forty hours later Mars had grown to a ruddy-orange ball that filled the ports and they were in the final planet-landing spiral. \"Slowly,\" Long said to himself, \"slowly.\" Under these conditions, even the thin atmosphere of Mars could do dreadful damage if they moved through it too quickly. Since they came in from well above the ecliptic, their spiral passed from north to south. A polar cap shot whitely below them, then the much smaller one of the summer hemisphere, the large one again, the small one, at longer and longer intervals. The planet approached closer, the landscape began to show features. \"Prepare for landing!\" called Long.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-10.html","bookId":1751,"book":{"id":1751,"title":"The Martian Way and Other Stories","description":"Storyline: This collection of four famous science fiction tales masterfully exemplifies author Isaac Asimov\u0027s ability to create quickly a believable human milieu in the midst of alien circumstances.
