One moment he had been strapped in his chair in contact with the clear mind of Gan; the next (there was no consciousness of separation in time) he was immersed in a medley of strange, barbaric, and broken thought. He closed his mind completely. It had been open wide to increase the effectiveness of resonance, and the first touch of the alien had been- Not painful-no. Dizzying, nauseating? No, not that, either. There was no word. He gathered resilience in the quiet nothingness of mind closure and considered his position. He felt the small touch of the Receiving Station, with which he was in mental liaison. That had come with him. Good! He ignored his host for the moment. He might need him for drastic operations later, so it would be wise to raise no suspicions for the moment. He explored. He entered a mind at random and took stock first of the sense impressions that permeated it. The creature was sensitive to parts of the electromagnetic spectrum and to vibrations of the air, and, of course, to bodily contact. It possessed localized chemical senses- That was about all. He looked again in astonishment. Not only was there no direct mass sense, no electro-potential sense, none of the really refined interpreters of the Universe, but there was no mental contact whatever. The creature\u0027s mind was completely isolated. Then how did they communicate? He looked further. They had a complicated code of controlled air vibrations. Were they intelligent? Had he chosen a maimed mind? No, they were all like that. He filtered the group of surrounding minds through his mental tendrils, searching for a Tech, or whatever passed for such among these crippled semi-intelligences. He found a mind which thought of itself as a controller of vehicles. A piece of information flooded Roi. He was on an air-borne vehicle. Then even without mental contact, they could build a rudimentary mechanical civilization. Or were they animals tools of real intelligences elsewhere on the planet? No... Their minds said no. He plumbed the Tech. What about the immediate environment? Were the bugbears of the ancients to be feared? It was a matter of interpretation. Dangers in the environment existed. Movements of air. Changes of temperature. Water falling in the air, either as liquid or solid. Electrical discharges. There were code vibrations for each phenomenon but that meant nothing. The connection of any of these with the names given to phenomena by the ancestral surface folk was a matter of conjecture. No matter. Was there danger now? Was there danger here? Was there any cause for fear or uneasiness? No! The Tech\u0027s mind said no. That was enough. He returned to his host mind and rested a moment, then cautiously expanded... Nothing! His host mind was blank. At most, there was a vague sense of warmth, and a dull flicker of undirected response to basic stimuli. Was his host dying after al? Aphasic? Decerebrate? He moved quickly to the mind nearest, dredging it for information about his host and finding it His host was an infant of the species. An infant? A normal infant? And so undeveloped? He allowed his mind to sink into and coalesce for a moment with what existed in his host. He searched for the motor areas of the brain and found them with difficulty. A cautious stimulus was followed by an erratic motion of his host\u0027s extremities. He attempted finer control and failed. He felt anger. Had they thought of everything after all? Had they thought of intelligences without mental contact? Had they thought of young creatures as completely undeveloped as though they were still in the egg? It meant, of course, that he could not, in the person of his host, activate the Receiving Station. The muscles and mind were far too weak, far too uncontrolled for any of the three methods outlined by Gan. He thought intensely. He could scarcely expect to influence much mass through the imperfect focusing of his host\u0027s material brain cells, but what about an indirect influence through an adult\u0027s brain? Direct physical influence would be minute; it would amount to the breakdown of the appropriate molecules of adenosine triphosphate and acetylocholine. Thereafter the creature would act on its own. He hesitated to try this, afraid of failure, then cursed himself for a coward. He entered the closest mind once more. It was a female of the species and it was in the state of temporary inhibition he had noticed in others. It didn\u0027t surprise him. Minds as rudimentary as these would need periodic respites. He considered the mind before him now, fingering mentally the areas that might respond to stimulation. He chose one, stabbed at it, and the conscious areas flooded with life almost simultaneously. Sense impressions poured in and the level of thought rose steeply. Good! But not good enough. That was a mere prod, a pinch. It was no order for specific action. He stirred uncomfortably as emotion cascaded over him. It came from the mind he had just stimulated and was directed, of course, at his host and not at him. Nevertheless, its primitive crudities annoyed him and he closed his mind against the unpleasant warmth of her uncovered feelings. A second mind centered about his host, and had he been material or had he controlled a satisfactory host, he would have struck out in vexation. Great caverns, weren\u0027t they going to allow him to concentrate on his serious business? He thrust sharply at the second mind, activating centers of discomfort, and it moved away. He was pleased. That had been more than a simple, undefined stimulation, and it had worked nicely. He had cleared the mental atmosphere. He returned to the Tech who controlled the vehicle. He would know the details concerning the surface over which they were passing. Water? He sorted the data quickly. Water! And more water! By the everlasting Levels, the word \"ocean\" made sense. The old, traditional word \"ocean.\" Who would dream that so much water could exist. But then, if this was \"ocean,\" then the traditional word \"island\" had an obvious significance. He thrust his whole mind into the quest for geographical information. The \"ocean\" was speckled with dots of land but he needed exact- He was interrupted by a short stab of surprise as his host moved through space and was held against the neighboring female\u0027s body. Roi\u0027s mind, engaged as it was, lay open and unguarded. In full intensity, the female\u0027s emotions piled in upon him. Roi winced. In an attempt to remove the distracting animal passions, he clamped down upon the host\u0027s brain cells, through which the rawness was funneling. He did that too quickly, too energetically. His host\u0027s mind flooded with a diffuse pain, and instantly almost every mind he could reach reacted at the air vibrations that resulted. In vexation, he tried to blanket the pain and succeeded only in stimulating it further. Through the clinging mental mists of his host\u0027s pain, he riffled the Tech\u0027s minds, striving to prevent contact from slipping out of focus. His mind went icy. The best chance was almost now! He had perhaps twenty minutes. There would be other chances afterward, but not as good. Yet he dared not attempt to direct the actions of another while his host\u0027s mind was in such complete disorganization. He retired, withdrew into mind closure, maintaining only the most tenuous connection with his host\u0027s spinal cells, and waited. Minutes passed, and little by little he returned to fuller liaison. He had five minutes left. He chose a subject.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-31.html","bookId":1751,"book":{"id":1751,"title":"The Martian Way and Other Stories","description":"Storyline: This collection of four famous science fiction tales masterfully exemplifies author Isaac Asimov\u0027s ability to create quickly a believable human milieu in the midst of alien circumstances.
