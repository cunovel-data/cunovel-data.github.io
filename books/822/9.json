{"id":19195,"no":9,"title":"DOUR DAVIE\u0027S DRIVE","content":"Pinnager was on snow-shoes, making a bee-line toward his field of sawlogs dark on the ice of Wolverine River. He crossed shanty roads, trod heaps of brush, forced his way through the tops of felled pines, jumped from little crags into seven feet of snow—Pinnager\u0027s men called him \"a terror on snow-shoes.\" They never knew the direction from which he might come—an ignorance which kept them all busy with axe, saw, cant-hook, and horses over the two square miles of forest comprising his \"cut.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was \"make or break\" with Pinnager. He had contracted to put on the ice all the logs he might make; for every one left in the woods he must pay stumpage and forfeit. Now his axemen had done such wonders that Pinnager\u0027s difficulty was to get his logs hauled out. \\n\\n \\n\\n Teams were scarce that winter. The shanty was eighty miles from any settlement; ordinary teamsters were not eager to work for a small speculative jobber, who might or might not be able to pay in the spring. But Pinnager had some extraordinary teamsters, sons of farmers who neighbored him at home, and who were sure he would pay them, though he should have to mortgage his land. \\n\\n \\n\\n The time was late February; seven feet of snow, crusted, on the level; a thaw might turn the whole forest floor to slush; but if the weather should \"hold hard\" for six weeks longer, Pinnager might make and not break. Yet the chances were heavily against him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Any jobber so situated would feel vexed on hearing that one of his best teams had suddenly been taken out of his service. Pinnager, crossing a shanty road with the stride of a moose, was hailed by Jamie Stuart with the news: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hey, boss, hold on! Davie McAndrews\u0027 leg\u0027s broke. His load slewed at the side hill—log catched him against a tree.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where is he?\" shouted Pinnager furiously. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Carried him to shanty.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where are his horses?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Stable.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tell Aleck Dunbar to go get them out. He must take Davie\u0027s place—confound the lad\u0027s carelessness!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Davie says no; won\u0027t let any other man drive his horses.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He won\u0027t? I\u0027ll show him!\" and Pinnager made a bee-line for his shanty. He was choking with rage, all the more so because he knew that nothing short of breaking Davie McAndrews\u0027 neck would break Davie McAndrews\u0027 stubbornness, a reflection that cooled Pinnager before he reached the shanty. \\n\\n \\n\\n The cook was busy about the caboose fire, getting supper for fifty-three devourers, when Pinnager entered the low door, and made straight for one of the double tier of dingy bunks. There lay a youth of eighteen, with an unusual pallor on his weather-beaten face, and more than the usual sternness about his formidable jaw. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s all this, Davie? You sure the leg\u0027s broke? I\u0027d \u0027a thought you old enough to take care.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You would?\" said Davie grimly. \"And yourself not old enough to have yon piece of road mended—you that was so often told about it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When you knew it was bad, the more you should take care.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And that\u0027s true, Pinnager. But no use in you and me choppin\u0027 words. I\u0027m needing a doctor\u0027s hands on me. Can you set a bone?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, I\u0027ll not meddle with it. Maybe Jock Scott can; but I\u0027ll send you out home. A fine loss I\u0027ll be at! Confound it—and me like to break for want of teams!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve thocht o\u0027 yer case, Pinnager,\" said Davie, with a curious judicial air. \"It\u0027s sore hard for ye; I ken that well. There\u0027s me and me feyther\u0027s horses gawn off, and you countin\u0027 on us. I feel for ye, so I do. But I\u0027ll no put you to ony loss in sendin\u0027 me out.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Was you thinking to tough it through here, Davie? No, you\u0027ll not chance it. Anyway, the loss would be the same—more, too. Why, if I send out for the doctor, there\u0027s a team off for full five days, and the expense of the doctor! Then he mightn\u0027t come. Wow, no! it\u0027s out you must go.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What else?\" said Davie coolly. \"Would I lie here till spring and my leg mendin\u0027 into the Lord kens what-like shape? Would I be lettin\u0027 ony ither drive the horses my feyther entrustit to my lone? Would I be dependin\u0027 on Mr. Pinnager for keep, and me idle? Man, I\u0027d eat the horses\u0027 heads off that way; at home they\u0027d be profit to my feyther. So it\u0027s me and them that starts at gray the morn\u0027s morn.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Alone!\" exclaimed Pinnager. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just that, man. What for no?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re light-headed, Davie. A lad with his leg broke can\u0027t drive three days.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Maybe yes and maybe no. I\u0027m for it, onyhow.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It may snow, it may——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Aye, or rain, or thaw, or hail; the Lord\u0027s no in the habit o\u0027 makin\u0027 weather suit ony but himsel\u0027. But I\u0027m gawn; the cost of a man wi\u0027 me would eat the wages ye\u0027re owing my feyther.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll lose his team, anyhow,\" said Pinnager, \"and me needing it bad. A driver with you could bring back the horses.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nay, my feyther will trust his beasts to nane but himsel\u0027 or his sons. But I\u0027ll have yer case in mind, Pinnager; it\u0027s a sore needcessity you\u0027re in. I\u0027ll ask my feyther to send back the team, and another to the tail of it; it\u0027s like that Tam and Neil will be home by now. And I\u0027ll spread word how ye\u0027re needin\u0027 teams, Pinnager; it\u0027s like your neighbors will send ye in sax or eight spans.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Man, that\u0027s a grand notion, Davie! But you can\u0027t go alone; it\u0027s clean impossible.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m gawn, Pinnager.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You can\u0027t turn out in seven feet of snow when you meet loading. You can\u0027t water or feed your horses. There\u0027s forty miles the second day, and never a stopping-place; your horses can\u0027t stand it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m wae for the beasts, Pinnager; but they\u0027ll have no force but to travel dry and hungry if that\u0027s set for them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re bound to go?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Div you tak\u0027 me for an idjit to be talkin\u0027 and no meanin\u0027 it? Off wi\u0027 ye, man! The leg\u0027s no exactly a comfort when I\u0027m talkin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, Davie, it must be hurting you terrible!\" Pinnager had almost forgotten the broken leg, such was Davie\u0027s composure. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s no exactly a comfort, I said. Get you gone, Pinnager; your men may be idlin\u0027. Get you gone, and send in Jock Scott, if he\u0027s man enough to handle my leg. I\u0027m wearyin\u0027 just now for my ain company.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As Davie had made his programme, so it stood. His will was inflexible to protests. Next morning at dawn they set him on a hay-bed in his low, unboxed sleigh. A bag of oats supported his back; his unhurt leg was braced against a piece of plank spiked down. Jock Scott had pulled the broken bones into what he thought their place, and tied that leg up in splints of cedar. \\n\\n \\n\\n The sleigh was enclosed by stakes, four on each side, all tied together by stout rope. The stake at Davie\u0027s right hand was shortened, that he might hang his reins there. His water-bucket was tied to another stake, and his bag of provisions to a third. He was warm in a coon-skin coat, and four pairs of blankets under or over him. \\n\\n \\n\\n At the last moment Pinnager protested: \"I must send a man to drive. It sha\u0027n\u0027t cost you a cent, Davie.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank you, kindly, Pinnager,\" said Davie gravely. \"I\u0027ll tell that to your credit at the settlement. But ye\u0027re needin\u0027 all your help, and I\u0027d take shame to worsen your chances. My feyther\u0027s horses need no drivin\u0027 but my word.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Indeed, they would \"gee,\" \"haw,\" or \"whoa\" like oxen, and loved his voice. Round-barrelled, deep-breathed, hardy, sure-footed, active, gentle, enduring, brave, and used to the exigencies of \"bush roads,\" they would take him through safely if horses\u0027 wit could. \\n\\n \\n\\n Davie had uttered never a groan after those involuntary ones forced from him when the log, driving his leg against a tree, had made him almost unconscious. But the pain-sweat stood beaded on his face during the torture of carrying him to the sleigh. Not a sound from his lips, though! They could guess his sufferings from naught but his hard breathing through the nose, that horrible sweat, and the iron set of his jaw. After they had placed him, the duller agony that had kept him awake all night returned; he smiled grimly, and said, \"That\u0027s a comfort.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He had eaten and drunk heartily; he seemed strong still; but what if his sleigh should turn over at some sidling place of the rude, lonely, and hilly forest road? \\n\\n \\n\\n As Davie chirruped to his horses and was off, the men gave him a cheer; then Pinnager and all went away to labor fit for mighty men, and the swinging of axes and the crashing of huge pines and the tumbling of logs from rollways left them fancy-free to wonder how Davie could ever brace himself to save his broken leg at the cahots. \\n\\n \\n\\n The terrible cahots—plunges in snow-roads! But for them Davie would have suffered little more than in a shanty bunk. The track was mostly two smooth ruts separated by a ridge so high and hard that the sleigh-bottom often slid on it. Horses less sure-footed would have staggered much, and bitten crossly at one another while trotting in those deep, narrow ruts, but Davie\u0027s horses kept their \"jog\" amiably, tossing their heads with glee to be traveling toward home. \\n\\n \\n\\n The clink of trace-chains, the clack of harness, the glide of runners on the hard, dry snow, the snorting of the frosty-nosed team, the long whirring of startled grouse—Davie heard only these sounds, and heard them dreamily in the long, smooth flights between cahots. \\n\\n \\n\\n Overhead the pine tops were a dark canopy with little fields of clear blue seen through the rifts of green; on the forest floor small firs bent under rounding weights of snow which often slid off as if moved by the stir of partridge wings; the fine tracery of hemlocks stood clean; and birches snuggled in snow that mingled with their curling rags. Sometimes a breeze eddied downward in the aisles, and then all the undergrowth was a silent commotion of snow, shaken and falling. Davie\u0027s eyes noted all things unconsciously; in spite of his pain he felt the enchantment of the winter woods until—another cahot! he called his team to walk. \\n\\n \\n\\n Never was one cahot without many in succession; he gripped his stake hard at each, braced his sound leg, and held on, feeling like to die with the horrible thrust of the broken one forward and then back; yet always his will ordered his desperate senses. \\n\\n \\n\\n Eleven o\u0027clock! Davie drew up before the half-breed Peter Whiteduck\u0027s midwood stopping-place, and briefly explained his situation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Give my horses a feed,\" he went on. \"There\u0027s oats in this bag. I\u0027ll no be moved mysel\u0027. Maybe you\u0027ll fetch me a tin of tea; I\u0027ve got my own provisions.\" So he ate and drank in the zero weather. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ll took lil\u0027 drink of whiskey,\" said Peter, with commiseration, as Davie was starting away. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t use it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ll got for need some \u0027fore you\u0027ll see de Widow Green place. Dass twenty-tree mile.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I will need it, then,\" said Davie, and was away. \\n\\n \\n\\n Evening had closed in when the bunch of teamsters awaiting supper at Widow Green\u0027s rude inn heard sleigh-bells, and soon a shout outside: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come out, some one!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n That was an insolence in the teamsters\u0027 code. Come out, indeed! The Widow Green, bustling about with fried pork, felt outraged. To be called out!—of her own house!—like a dog!—not she! \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come out here, somebody!\" Davie shouted again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"G\u0027 out and break his head one of you,\" said fighting Moses Frost. \"To be shoutin\u0027 like a lord!\" Moses was too great a personage to go out and wreak vengeance on an unknown. \\n\\n \\n\\n Narcisse Larocque went—to thrash anybody would be glory for Narcisse, and he felt sure that Moses would not, in these circumstances, let anybody thrash him.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What for you shout lak\u0027 dat? Call mans hout, hey?\" said Narcisse. \"I\u0027ll got good mind for broke your head, me!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hi, there, men!\" Davie ignored Narcisse as he saw figures through the open door. \"Some white man come out. My leg\u0027s broke.\" \\n\\n MY LEG IS BROKE \\n\\n MY LEG IS BROKE \\n\\n \\n\\n Oh, then the up-jumping of big men! Moses, striding forth, ruthlessly shoved Narcisse, who lay and cowered with legs up as a dog trying to placate an angry master. Then Moses carried Davie in as gently as if the young stalwart had been a girl baby, and laid him on the widow\u0027s one spare bed. \\n\\n \\n\\n That night Davie slept soundly for four hours, and woke to consciousness that his leg was greatly swollen. He made no moan, but lay in the darkness listening to the heavy breathing of the teamsters on the floor. They could do nothing for him; why should he awaken them? As for pitying himself, Davie could do nothing so fruitless. He fell to plans for getting teams in to Pinnager, for this young Scot\u0027s practical mind was horrified at the thought that the man should fail financially when ten horses might give him a fine profit for his winter\u0027s work. \\n\\n \\n\\n Davie was away at dawn, every slight jolt giving his swollen leg pain almost unendurable, as if edges of living bone were griding together and also tearing cavities in the living flesh; but he must endure it, and well too, for the teamsters had warned him he must meet \"strings of loadin\u0027\" this day. \\n\\n \\n\\n The rule of the long one-tracked road into the wilderness is, of course, that empty outgoing sleighs shall turn out for incoming laden ones. Turn out into seven feet of snow! Davie trusted that incoming teamsters would handle his floundering horses, and he set his mind to plan how they might save him from tumbling about on his turned-out sleigh. \\n\\n \\n\\n About nine o\u0027clock, on a winding road, he called, \"Whoa!\" and his bays stood. A sleigh piled with baled hay confronted him thirty yards distant. Four others followed closely; the load drawn by the sixth team was hidden by the woodland curve. No teamsters were visible; they must be walking behind the procession; and Davie wasted no strength in shouting. On came the laden teams, till the steam of the leaders mingled with the clouds blown by his bays. At that halt angry teamsters, yelling, ran forward and sprang, one by one, up on their loads, the last to grasp reins being the leading driver. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Turn out, you fool!\" he shouted. Then to his comrades behind, \"There\u0027s a blamed idyit don\u0027t know enough to turn out for loading!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Davie said nothing. It was not till one angry man was at his horses\u0027 heads and two more about to tumble his sleigh aside that he spoke: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My leg is broke.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Gah! G\u0027way! A man driving with his leg broke! You\u0027re lying! Come, get out and tramp down snow for your horses! It\u0027s your back ought to be broke—stoppin\u0027 loadin\u0027!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My leg is broke,\" Davie calmly insisted. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You mean it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Davie threw off his blankets. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Begor, it is broke!\" \"And him drivin\u0027 himself!\" \"It\u0027s a terror!\" \"Great spunk entirely!\" Then the teamsters began planning to clear the way. \\n\\n \\n\\n That was soon settled by Davie\u0027s directions: \"Tramp down the crust for my horses; onhitch them; lift my sleigh out on the crust; pass on; then set me back on the road.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Half an hour was consumed by the operation—thrice repeated before twelve o\u0027clock. Fortunately Davie came on the last \"string\" of teams halted for lunch by the edge of a lake. The teamsters fed and watered his horses, gave him hot tea, and with great admiration saw him start for an afternoon drive of twenty-two miles. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ll not likely meet any teams,\" they said. \"The last of the \u0027loading\u0027 that\u0027s like to come in soon is with ourselves.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n How Davie got down the hills, up the hills, across the rivers and over the lakes of that terrible afternoon he could never rightly tell. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m thinkin\u0027 I was light-heided,\" he said afterward. \"The notion was in me somehow that the Lord was lookin\u0027 to me to save Pinnager\u0027s bits of children. I\u0027d waken out of it at the cahots—there was mair than enough. On the smooth my head would be strange-like, and I mind but the hinder end of my horses till the moon was high and me stoppit by McGraw\u0027s.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n During the night at McGraw\u0027s his head was cleared by some hours of sound sleep, and next morning he insisted on traveling, though snow was falling heavily. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My feyther\u0027s place is no more than a bittock ayont twenty-eight miles,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll make it by three of the clock, if the Lord\u0027s willin\u0027, and get the doctor\u0027s hands on me. It\u0027s my leg I\u0027m thinkin\u0027 of savin\u0027. And mind ye, McGraw, you\u0027ve promised me to send in your team to Pinnager.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Perhaps people who have never risen out of bitter poverty will not understand Davie\u0027s keen anxiety about Pinnager and Pinnager\u0027s children; but the McAndrews and Pinnagers and all their neighbors of \"the Scotch settlement\" had won up by the tenacious labor and thrift of many years. Davie remembered well how, in his early boyhood, he had often craved more food and covering. Pinnager and his family should not be thrown back into the gulf of poverty if Davie McAndrews\u0027 will could save them. \\n\\n \\n\\n This day his road lay through a country thinly settled, but he could see few cabins through the driving storm. The flagging horses trotted steadily, as if aware that the road would become worse the longer they were on it, but about ten o\u0027clock they inclined to stop where Davie could dimly see a long house and a shed with a team and sleigh standing in it. Drunken yells told him this must be Black Donald Donaldson\u0027s notorious tavern; so he chirruped his horses onward. \\n\\n \\n\\n Ten minutes later yells and sleigh-bells were following him at a furious pace. Davie turned head and shouted; still the drunken men shrieked and came on. He looked for a place to turn out—none! He dared not stop his horses lest the gallopers, now close behind him, should be over him and his low sleigh. Now his team broke into a run at the noises, but the fresh horses behind sped faster. The men were hidden from Davie by their crazed horses. He could not rise to appeal; he could not turn to daunt the horses with his whip; their front-hoofs, rising high, were soon within twenty feet of him. Did his horses slacken, the others would be on top of him, kicking and tumbling. \\n\\n \\n\\n The cahots were numerous; his yells for a halt became so much like screams of agony that he took shame of them, shut his mouth firmly, and knew not what to do. Then suddenly his horses swerved into the cross-road to the Scotch settlement, while the drunkards galloped away on the main road, still lashing and yelling. Davie does not know to this day who the men were. \\n\\n \\n\\n Five hours later David McAndrews, the elder, kept at home by the snowstorm, heard bells in his lane, and looked curiously out of the sitting-room window. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Losh, Janet!\" he said, most deliberately. \"I wasna expeckin\u0027 Davie; here he\u0027s back wi\u0027 the bays.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He did not hurry out to meet his fourth son, for he is a man who hates the appearance of haste; but his wife did, and came rushing back through the kitchen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s Davie himsel\u0027! He\u0027s back wi\u0027 his leg broke! He\u0027s come a\u0027 the way by his lone!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hoot-toot, woman! Ye\u0027re daft!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m no daft; come and see yoursel\u0027. Wae\u0027s me, my Davie\u0027s like to die! Me daft, indeed! Ye\u0027ll need to send Neil straight awa\u0027 to the village for Doctor Aberdeen.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And so dour Davie\u0027s long drive was past. While his brother carried him in, his will was occupied with the torture, but he had scarcely been laid on his bed when he said, very respectfully—but faintly—to his father: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ll be sendin\u0027 Neil oot for the doctor, sir? Aye; then I\u0027d be thankfu\u0027 if you\u0027d give Aleck leave to tak\u0027 the grays and warn the settlement that Pinnager\u0027s needin\u0027 teams sorely. He\u0027s like to make or break; if he gets sax or eight spans in time he\u0027s a made man.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n That was enough for the men of the Scotch settlement. Pinnager got all the help he needed; and yet he is far from as rich to-day as Davie McAndrews, the great Brazeau River lumberman, who walks a little lame of his left leg. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1867/54034.html","bookId":822,"book":{"id":822,"title":"Old Man Savarin Stories","description":"简介： Yes, indeed, my grandfather wass once in jail, said old Mrs. McTavish, of the county of Glengarry, in Ontario, Canada; but that wass for debt, and he wass a ferry honest man whateffer, and he would not broke his promiseno, not for all the money in Ca...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1867","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:35 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:35 AM"}}
