{"id":19199,"no":13,"title":"THE RIDE BY NIGHT","content":"Mr. Adam Baines is a little gray about the temples, but still looks so young that few could suppose him to have been one of the fifty-three thousand Canadians who served Abraham Lincoln\u0027s cause in the Civil War. Indeed, he was in the army less than a year. How he went out of it he told me in some such words as these:— \n \n An orderly from the direction of Meade\u0027s headquarters galloped into our parade ground, and straight for the man on guard before the colonel\u0027s tent. That was pretty late in the afternoon of a bright March day in 1865, but the parade ground was all red mud with shallow pools. I remember well how the hind hoofs of the orderly\u0027s galloper threw away great chunks of earth as he splashed diagonally across the open. \n \n His rider never slowed till he brought his horse to its haunches before the sentry. There he flung himself off instantly, caught up his sabre, and ran through the middle opening of the high screen of sapling pines stuck on end, side by side, all around the acre or so occupied by the officers\u0027 quarters. \n \n The day, though sunny, was not warm, and nearly all the men of my regiment were in their huts when that galloping was heard. Then they hurried out like bees from rows of hives, ran up the lanes between the lines of huts, and collected, each company separately, on the edge of the parade ground opposite the officers\u0027 quarters. \n \n You see we had a notion that the orderly had brought the word to break camp. For five months the Army of the Potomac had been in winter quarters, and for weeks nothing more exciting than vidette duty had broken the monotony of our brigade. We understood that Sheridan had received command of all Grant\u0027s cavalry, but did not know but the orderly had rushed from Sheridan himself. Yet we awaited the man\u0027s re-appearance with intense curiosity. \n \n Soon, instead of the orderly, out ran our first lieutenant, a small, wiry, long-haired man named Miller. He was in undress uniform,—just a blouse and trousers,—and bare-headed. Though he wore low shoes, he dashed through mud and water toward us, plainly in a great hurry. \n \n \"Sergeant Kennedy, I want ten men at once—mounted,\" Miller said. \"Choose the ten best able for a long ride, and give them the best horses in the company. You understand,—no matter whose the ten best horses are, give \u0027em to the ten best riders.\" \n \n \"I understand, sir,\" said Kennedy. \n \n By this time half the company had started for the stables, for fully half considered themselves among the best riders. The lieutenant laughed at their eagerness. \n \n \"Halt, boys!\" he cried. \"Sergeant, I\u0027ll pick out four myself. Come yourself, and bring Corporal Crowfoot, Private Bader, and Private Absalom Gray.\" \n \n Crowfoot, Bader, and Gray had been running for the stables with the rest. Now these three old soldiers grinned and walked, as much as to say, \"We needn\u0027t hurry; we\u0027re picked anyhow;\" while the others hurried on. I remained near Kennedy, for I was so young and green a soldier that I supposed I had no chance to go. \n \n \"Hurry up! parade as soon as possible. One day\u0027s rations; light marching order—no blankets—fetch over-coats and ponchos,\" said Miller, turning; \"and in choosing your men, favor light weights.\" \n \n That was, no doubt, the remark which brought me in. I was lanky, light, bred among horses, and one of the best in the regiment had fallen to my lot. Kennedy wheeled, and his eye fell on me. \n \n \"Saddle up, Adam, boy,\" said he; \"I guess you\u0027ll do.\" \n \n Lieutenant Miller ran back to his quarters, his long hair flying wide. When he reappeared fifteen minutes later, we were trotting across the parade ground to meet him. He was mounted, not on his own charger, but on the colonel\u0027s famous thorough-bred bay. Then we knew a hard ride must be in prospect. \n \n \"What! one of the boys?\" cried Miller, as he saw me. \"He\u0027s too young.\" \n \n \"He\u0027s very light, sir; tough as hickory. I guess he\u0027ll do,\" said Kennedy. \n \n \"Well, no time to change now. Follow me! But, hang it, you\u0027ve got your carbines! Oh, I forgot! Keep pistols only! throw down your sabres and carbines—anywhere—never mind the mud!\" \n \n As we still hesitated to throw down our clean guns, he shouted: \"Down with them—anywhere! Now, boys, after me, by twos! Trot—gallop!\" \n \n Away we went, not a man jack of us knew for where or what. The colonel and officers, standing grouped before regimental headquarters, volleyed a cheer at us. It was taken up by the whole regiment; it was taken up by the brigade; it was repeated by regiment after regiment of infantry as we galloped through the great camp toward the left front of the army. The speed at which Miller led over a rough corduroy road was extraordinary, and all the men suspected some desperate enterprise afoot. \n \n Red and brazen was the set of the sun. I remember it well, after we got clear of the forts, clear of the breastworks, clear of the reserves, down the long slope and across the wide ford of Grimthorpe\u0027s Creek, never drawing rein. \n \n The lieutenant led by ten yards or so. He had ordered each two to take as much distance from the other two in advance; but we rode so fast that the water from the heels of his horse and from the heels of each two splashed into the faces of the following men. \n \n From the ford we loped up a hill, and passed the most advanced infantry pickets, who laughed and chaffed us, asking us for locks of our hair, and if our mothers knew we were out, and promising to report our last words faithfully to the folks at home. \n \n Soon we turned to the left again, swept close by several cavalry videttes, and knew then that we were bound for a ride through a country that might or might not be within Lee\u0027s outer lines, at that time extended so thinly in many places that his pickets were far out of touch with one another. To this day I do not know precisely where we went, nor precisely what for. Soldiers are seldom informed of the meaning of their movements. \n \n What I do know is what we did while I was in the ride. As we were approaching dense pine woods the lieutenant turned in his saddle, slacked pace a little, and shouted, \"Boys, bunch up near me!\" \n \n He screwed round in his saddle so far that we could all see and hear, and said:— \n \n \"Boys, the order is to follow this road as fast as we can till our horses drop, or else the Johnnies drop us, or else we drop upon three brigades of our own infantry. I guess they\u0027ve got astray somehow; but I don\u0027t know myself what the trouble is. Our orders are plain. The brigades are supposed to be somewhere on this road. I guess we shall do a big thing if we reach those men to-night. All we\u0027ve got to do is to ride and deliver this despatch to the general in command. You all understand?\" \n \n \"Yes, sir! Yes, sir! Yes, sir!\" \n \n \"It\u0027s necessary you all should. Hark, now! We are not likely to strike the enemy in force, but we are likely to run up against small parties. Now, Kennedy, if they down me, you are to stop just long enough to grab the despatch from my breast; then away you go,—always on the main road. If they down you after you\u0027ve got the paper, the man who can grab it first is to take it and hurry forward. So on right to the last man. If they down him, and he\u0027s got his senses when he falls, he\u0027s to tear the paper up, and scatter it as widely as he can. You all understand?\" \n \n \"Yes, sir! Yes, sir!\" \n \n \"All right, then. String out again!\" \n \n He touched the big bay with the spur, and shot quickly ahead. \n \n With the long rest of the winter our horses were in prime spirits, though mostly a little too fleshy for perfect condition. I had cared well for my horse; he was fast and sound in wind and limb. I was certainly the lightest rider of the eleven. \n \n I was still thinking of the probability that I should get further on the way than any comrade except the lieutenant, or perhaps Crowfoot and Bader, whose horses were in great shape; I was thinking myself likely to win promotion before morning, when a cry came out of the darkness ahead. The words of the challenge I was not able to catch, but I heard Miller shout, \"Forward, boys!\" \n \n We shook out more speed just as a rifle spat its long flash at us from about a hundred yards ahead. For one moment I plainly saw the Southerner\u0027s figure. Kennedy reeled beside me, flung up his hands with a scream, and fell. His horse stopped at once. In a moment the lieutenant had ridden the sentry down. \n \n Then from the right side of the road a party, who must have been lying round the camp-fire that we faintly saw in among the pines, let fly at us. They had surely been surprised in their sleep. I clearly saw them as their guns flashed. \n \n \"Forward! Don\u0027t shoot! Ride on,\" shouted Miller. \"Bushwhackers! Thank God, not mounted! Any of you make out horses with them?\" \n \n \"No, sir! No, sir!\" \n \n \"Who yelled? who went down?\" \n \n \"Kennedy, sir,\" I cried. \n \n \"Too bad! Any one else?\" \n \n \"No, sir.\" \n \n \"All safe?\" \n \n \"I\u0027m touched in my right arm; but it\u0027s nothing,\" I said. The twinge was slight, and in the fleshy place in front of my shoulder. I could not make out that I was losing blood, and the pain from the hurt was scarcely perceptible. \n \n \"Good boy! Keep up, Adam!\" called the lieutenant with a kind tone. I remember my delight that he spoke my front name. On we flew. \n \n Possibly the shots had been heard by the party half a mile further on, for they greeted us with a volley. A horse coughed hard and pitched down behind me. His rider yelled as he fell. Then two more shots came: Crowfoot reeled in front of me, and somehow checked his horse. I saw him no more. Next moment we were upon the group with our pistols. \n \n \"Forward, men! Don\u0027t stop to fight!\" roared Miller, as he got clear. A rifle was fired so close to my head that the flame burned my back hair, and my ears rang for half an hour or more. My bay leaped high and dashed down a man. In a few seconds I was fairly out of the scrimmage. \n \n How many of my comrades had gone down I knew not, nor beside whom I was riding. Suddenly our horses plunged into a hole; his stumbled, the man pitched forward, and was left behind. Then I heard a shot, the clatter of another falling horse, the angry yell of another thrown rider. \n \n On we went,—the relics of us. Now we rushed, out of the pine forest into broad moonlight, and I saw two riders between me and the lieutenant,—one man almost at my shoulder, and another galloping ten yards behind. Very gradually this man dropped to the rear. We had lost five men already, and still the night was young. \n \n Bader and Absalom Gray were nearest me. Neither spoke a word till we struck upon a space of sandy road. Then I could hear, far behind the rear man, a sound of galloping on the hard highway. \n \n \"They\u0027re after us, lieutenant!\" shouted Bader. \n \n \"Many?\" He slacked speed, and we listened attentively. \n \n \"Only one,\" cried Miller. \"He\u0027s coming fast.\" \n \n The pursuer gained so rapidly that we looked to our pistols again. Then Absalom Gray cried: \n \n \"It\u0027s only a horse!\" \n \n In a few moments the great gray of fallen Corporal Crowfoot overtook us, went ahead, and slacked speed by the lieutenant. \n \n \"Good! He\u0027ll be fresh when the rest go down!\" shouted Miller. \"Let the last man mount the gray!\" \n \n By this time we had begun to think ourselves clear of the enemy, and doomed to race on till the horses should fall. \n \n Suddenly the hoofs of Crowfoot\u0027s gray and the lieutenant\u0027s bay thundered upon a plank road whose hollow noise, when we all reached it, should have been heard far. It took us through wide orchard lands into a low-lying mist by the banks of a great marsh, till we passed through that fog, strode heavily up a slope, and saw the shimmer of roofs under the moon. Straight through the main street we pounded along. \n \n Whether it was wholly deserted I know not, but not a human being was in the streets, nor any face visible at the black windows. Not even a dog barked. I noticed no living thing except some turkeys roosting on a fence, and a white cat that sprang upon the pillar of a gateway and thence to a tree. \n \n Some of the houses seemed to have been ruined by a cannonade. I suppose it was one of the places almost destroyed in Willoughby\u0027s recent raid. Here we thundered, expecting ambush and conflict every moment, while the loneliness of the street imposed on me such a sense as might come of galloping through a long cemetery of the dead. \n \n Out of the village we went off the planks again upon sand. I began to suspect that I was losing a good deal of blood. My brain was on fire with whirling thoughts and wonder where all was to end. Out of this daze I came, in amazement to find that we were quickly overtaking our lieutenant\u0027s thoroughbred. \n \n Had he been hit in the fray, and bled to weakness? I only know that, still galloping while we gained, the famous horse lurched forward, almost turned a somersault, and fell on his rider. \n \n \"Stop—the paper!\" shouted Bader. \n \n We drew rein, turned, dismounted, and found Miller\u0027s left leg under the big bay\u0027s shoulder. The horse was quite dead, the rider\u0027s long hair lay on the sand, his face was white under the moon! \n \n We stopped long enough to extricate him, and he came to his senses just as we made out that his left leg was broken. \n \n \"Forward!\" he groaned. \"What in thunder are you stopped for? Oh, the despatch! Here! away you go! Good-bye.\" \n \n In attending to Miller we had forgotten the rider who had been long gradually dropping behind. Now as we galloped away,—Bader, Absalom Gray, myself, and Crowfoot\u0027s riderless horse,—I looked behind for that comrade; but he was not to be seen or heard. We three were left of the eleven. \n \n From the loss of so many comrades the importance of our mission seemed huge. With the speed, the noise, the deaths, the strangeness of the gallop through that forsaken village, the wonder how all would end, the increasing belief that thousands of lives depended on our success, and the longing to win, my brain was wild. A raging desire to be first held me, and I galloped as if in a dream. \n \n Bader led; the riderless gray thundered beside him; Absalom rode stirrup to stirrup with me. He was a veteran of the whole war. Where it was that his sorrel rolled over I do not remember at all, though I perfectly remember how Absalom sprang up, staggered, shouted, \"My foot is sprained!\" and fell as I turned to look at him and went racing on. \n ABSALOM SPRANG UP, STAGGERED, SHOUTED \n ABSALOM SPRANG UP, STAGGERED, SHOUTED \n \n Then I heard above the sound of our hoofs the voice of the veteran of the war. Down as he was, his spirit was unbroken. In the favorite song of the army his voice rose clear and gay and piercing:— \n \n \"Hurrah for the union! \n Hurrah, boys, hurrah! \n Shouting the battle-cry of freedom!\" \n \n \n We turned our heads and cheered him as we flew, for there was something indescribably inspiring in the gallant and cheerful lilt of the fallen man. It was as if he flung us, from the grief of utter defeat, a soul unconquerable; and I felt the life in me strengthened by the tone. \n \n Old Bader and I for it! He led by a hundred yards, and Crowfoot\u0027s gray kept his stride. Was I gaining on them? How was it that I could see his figure outlined more clearly against the horizon? Surely dawn was not coming on! \n \n No; I looked round on a world of naked peach-orchards, and corn-fields ragged with last year\u0027s stalks, all dimly lit by a moon that showed far from midnight; and that faint light on the horizon was not in the east, but in the west. The truth flashed on me,—I was looking at such an illumination of the sky as would be caused by the camp-fires of an army. \n \n \"The missing brigade!\" I shouted. \n \n \"Or a Southern division!\" Bader cried. \"Come on!\" \n \n \"Come on!\" I was certainly gaining on him, but very slowly. Before the nose of my bay was beyond the tail of his roan, the wide illuminations had become more distinct; and still not a vidette, not a picket, not a sound of the proximity of an army. \n \n Bader and I now rode side by side, and Crowfoot\u0027s gray easily kept the pace. My horse was in plain distress, but Bader\u0027s was nearly done. \n \n \"Take the paper, Adam,\" he said; \"my roan won\u0027t go much further. Good-bye, youngster. Away you go!\" and I drew now quickly ahead. \n \n Still Bader rode on behind me. In a few minutes he was considerably behind. Perhaps the sense of being alone increased my feeling of weakness. Was I going to reel out of the saddle? Had I lost so much blood as that? Still I could hear Bader riding on. I turned to look at him. Already he was scarcely visible. Soon he dropped out of sight; but still I heard the laborious pounding of his desperate horse. \n \n My bay was gasping horribly. How far was that faintly yellow sky ahead? It might be two, it might be five miles. Were union or Southern soldiers beneath it? Could it be conceived that no troops of the enemy were between me and it? \n \n Never mind; my orders were clear. I rode straight on, and I was still riding straight on, marking no increase in the distress of my bay, when he stopped as if shot, staggered, fell on his knees, tried to rise, rolled to his side, groaned and lay. \n \n I was so weak I could not clear myself. I remember my right spur catching in my saddle-cloth as I tried to free my foot; then I pitched forward and fell. Not yet senseless, I clutched at my breast for the despatch, meaning to tear it to pieces; but there my brain failed, and in full view of the goal of the night I lay unconscious. \n \n When I came to, I rose on my left elbow, and looked around. Near my feet my poor bay lay, stone dead. Crowfoot\u0027s gray!—where was Crowfoot\u0027s gray? It flashed on me that I might mount the fresh horse and ride on. But where was the gray? As I peered round I heard faintly the sound of a galloper. Was he coming my way? No; faintly and more faintly I heard the hoofs. \n \n Had the gray gone on then, without the despatch? I clutched at my breast. My coat was unbuttoned—the paper was gone! \n \n Well, sir, I cheered. My God! but it was comforting to hear those far-away hoofs, and know that Bader must have come up, taken the papers, and mounted Crowfoot\u0027s gray, still good for a ten-mile ride! The despatch was gone forward; we had not all fallen in vain; maybe the brigades would be saved! \n \n How purely the stars shone! When I stifled my groaning they seemed to tell me of a great peace to come. How still was the night! and I thought of the silence of the multitudes who had died for the union. \n \n Now the galloping had quite died away. There was not a sound,—a slight breeze blew, but there were no leaves to rustle. I put my head down on the neck of my dead horse. Extreme fatigue was benumbing the pain of my now swelling arm; perhaps sleep was near, perhaps I was swooning. \n \n But a sound came that somewhat revived me. Far, low, joyful, it crept on the air. I sat up, wide awake. The sound, at first faint, died as the little breeze fell, then grew in the lull, and came ever more clearly as the wind arose. It was a sound never to be forgotten,—the sound of the distant cheering of thousands of men. \n \n Then I knew that Bader had galloped into the union lines, delivered the despatch, and told a story which had quickly passed through wakeful brigades. \n \n Bader I never saw again, nor Lieutenant Miller, nor any man with whom I rode that night. When I came to my senses I was in hospital at City Point. Thence I went home invalided. No surgeon, no nurse, no soldier at the hospital could tell me of my regiment, or how or why I was where I was. All they could tell me was that Richmond was taken, the army far away in pursuit of Lee, and a rumor flying that the great commander of the South had surrendered near Appomattox Court House. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1867/54038.html","bookId":822,"book":{"id":822,"title":"Old Man Savarin Stories","description":"简介： Yes, indeed, my grandfather wass once in jail, said old Mrs. McTavish, of the county of Glengarry, in Ontario, Canada; but that wass for debt, and he wass a ferry honest man whateffer, and he would not broke his promiseno, not for all the money in Ca...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1867","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:35 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:35 AM"}}
