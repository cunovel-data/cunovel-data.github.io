{"id":19188,"no":2,"title":"PRIVILEGE OF THE LIMITS","content":"\"Yes, indeed, my grandfather wass once in jail,\" said old Mrs. McTavish, of the county of Glengarry, in Ontario, Canada; \"but that wass for debt, and he wass a ferry honest man whateffer, and he would not broke his promise—no, not for all the money in Canada. If you will listen to me, I will tell chust exactly the true story about that debt, to show you what an honest man my grandfather wass. \n \n \"One time Tougal Stewart, him that wass the poy\u0027s grandfather that keeps the same store in Cornwall to this day, sold a plough to my grandfather, and my grandfather said he would pay half the plough in October, and the other half whateffer time he felt able to pay the money. Yes, indeed, that was the very promise my grandfather gave. \n \n \"So he was at Tougal Stewart\u0027s store on the first of October early in the morning pef ore the shutters wass taken off, and he paid half chust exactly to keep his word. Then the crop wass ferry pad next year, and the year after that one of his horses wass killed py lightning, and the next year his brother, that wass not rich and had a big family, died, and do you think wass my grandfather to let the family be disgraced without a good funeral? No, indeed. So my grandfather paid for the funeral, and there was at it plenty of meat and drink for eferypody, as wass the right Hielan\u0027 custom those days; and after the funeral my grandfather did not feel chust exactly able to pay the other half for the plough that year either. \n \n \"So, then, Tougal Stewart met my grandfather in Cornwall next day after the funeral, and asked him if he had some money to spare. \n \n \"\u0027Wass you in need of help, Mr. Stewart?\u0027 says my grandfather, kindly. \u0027For if it\u0027s in any want you are, Tougal,\u0027 says my grandfather, \u0027I will sell the coat off my back, if there is no other way to lend you a loan\u0027; for that wass always the way of my grandfather with all his friends, and a bigger-hearted man there never wass in all Glengarry, or in Stormont, or in Dundas, moreofer. \n \n \"\u0027In want!\u0027 says Tougal—\u0027in want, Mr. McTavish!\u0027 says he, very high. \u0027Would you wish to insult a gentleman, and him of the name of Stewart, that\u0027s the name of princes of the world?\u0027 he said, so he did. \n \n \"Seeing Tougal had his temper up, my grandfather spoke softly, being a quiet, peaceable man, and in wonder what he had said to offend Tougal. \n \n \"\u0027Mr. Stewart,\u0027 says my grandfather, \u0027it wass not in my mind to anger you whatefer. Only I thought, from your asking me if I had some money, that you might be looking for a wee bit of a loan, as many a gentleman has to do at times, and no shame to him at all,\u0027 said my grandfather. \n \n \"\u0027A loan?\u0027 says Tougal, sneering. \u0027A loan, is it? Where\u0027s your memory, Mr. McTavish? Are you not owing me half the price of the plough you\u0027ve had these three years?\u0027 \n \n \"\u0027And wass you asking me for money for the other half of the plough?\u0027 says my grandfather, very astonished. \n \n \"\u0027Just that,\u0027 says Tougal. \n \n \"\u0027Have you no shame or honor in you?\u0027 says my grandfather, firing up. \u0027How could I feel able to pay that now, and me chust yesterday been giving my poor brother a funeral fit for the McTavishes\u0027 own grand-nephew, that wass as good chentleman\u0027s plood as any Stewart in Glengarry. You saw the expense I wass at, for there you wass, and I thank you for the politeness of coming, Mr. Stewart,\u0027 says my grandfather, ending mild, for the anger would never stay in him more than a minute, so kind was the nature he had. \n \n \"\u0027If you can spend money on a funeral like that, you can pay me for my plough,\u0027 says Stewart; for with buying and selling he wass become a poor creature, and the heart of a Hielan\u0027man wass half gone out of him, for all he wass so proud of his name of monarchs and kings. \n \n \"My grandfather had a mind to strike him down on the spot, so he often said; but he thought of the time when he hit Hamish Cochrane in anger, and he minded the penances the priest put on him for breaking the silly man\u0027s jaw with that blow, so he smothered the heat that wass in him, and turned away in scorn. With that Tougal Stewart went to court, and sued my grandfather, puir mean creature. \n \n \"You might think that Judge Jones—him that wass judge in Cornwall before Judge Jarvis that\u0027s dead—would do justice. But no, he made it the law that my grandfather must pay at once, though Tougal Stewart could not deny what the bargain wass. \n \n \"\u0027Your Honor,\u0027 says my grandfather, \u0027I said I\u0027d pay when I felt able. And do I feel able now? No, I do not,\u0027 says he. \u0027It\u0027s a disgrace to Tougal Stewart to ask me, and himself telling you what the bargain wass,\u0027 said my grandfather. But Judge Jones said that he must pay, for all that he did not feel able. \n \n \"\u0027I will nefer pay one copper till I feel able,\u0027 says my grandfather; \u0027but I\u0027ll keep my Hielan\u0027 promise to my dying day, as I always done,\u0027 says he. \n \n \"And with that the old judge laughed, and said he would have to give judgment. And so he did; and after that Tougal Stewart got out an execution. But not the worth of a handful of oatmeal could the bailiff lay hands on, because my grandfather had chust exactly taken the precaution to give a bill of sale on his gear to his neighbor, Alexander Frazer, that could be trusted to do what was right after the law play was over. \n \n \"The whole settlement had great contempt for Tougal Stewart\u0027s conduct; but he wass a headstrong body, and once he begun to do wrong against my grandfather, he held on, for all that his trade fell away; and finally he had my grandfather arrested for debt, though you\u0027ll understand, sir, that he was owing Stewart nothing that he ought to pay when he didn\u0027t feel able. \n \n \"In those times prisoners for debt wass taken to jail in Cornwall, and if they had friends to give bail that they would not go beyond the posts that wass around the sixteen acres nearest the jail walls, the prisoners could go where they liked on that ground. This was called \u0027the privilege of the limits.\u0027 The limits, you\u0027ll understand, wass marked by cedar posts painted white about the size of hitching-posts. \n \n \"The whole settlement wass ready to go bail for my grandfather if he wanted it, and for the health of him he needed to be in the open air, and so he gave Tuncan Macdonnell of the Greenfields, and ?neas Macdonald of the Sandfields, for his bail, and he promised, on his Hielan\u0027 word of honor, not to go beyond the posts. With that he went where he pleased, only taking care that he never put even the toe of his foot beyond a post, for all that some prisoners of the limits would chump ofer them and back again, or maybe swing round them, holding by their hands. \n \n \"Efery day the neighbors would go into Cornwall to give my grandfather the good word, and they would offer to pay Tougal Stewart for the other half of the plough, only that vexed my grandfather, for he wass too proud to borrow, and, of course, every day he felt less and less able to pay on account of him having to hire a man to be doing the spring ploughing and seeding and making the kale-yard. \n \n \"All this time, you\u0027ll mind, Tougal Stewart had to pay five shillings a week for my grandfather\u0027s keep, the law being so that if the debtor swore he had not five pounds\u0027 worth of property to his name, then the creditor had to pay the five shillings, and, of course, my grandfather had nothing to his name after he gave the bill of sale to Alexander Frazer. A great diversion it was to my grandfather to be reckoning up that if he lived as long as his father, that was hale and strong at ninety-six, Tougal would need to pay five or six hundred pounds for him, and there was only two pound five shillings to be paid on the plough. \n \n \"So it was like that all summer, my grandfather keeping heartsome, with the neighbors coming in so steady to bring him the news of the settlement. There he would sit, just inside one of the posts, for to pass his jokes, and tell what he wished the family to be doing next. This way it might have kept going on for forty years, only it came about that my grand-father\u0027s youngest child—him that was my father—fell sick, and seemed like to die. \n \n \"Well, when my grandfather heard that bad news, he wass in a terrible way, to be sure, for he would be longing to hold the child in his arms, so that his heart was sore and like to break. Eat he could not, sleep he could not: all night he would be groaning, and all day he would be walking around by the posts, wishing that he had not passed his Hielan\u0027 word of honor not to go beyond a post; for he thought how he could have broken out like a chentleman, and gone to see his sick child, if he had stayed inside the jail wall. So it went on three days and three nights pefore the wise thought came into my grandfather\u0027s head to show him how he need not go beyond the posts to see his little sick poy. With that he went straight to one of the white cedar posts, and pulled it up out of the hole, and started for home, taking great care to carry it in his hands pefore him, so he would not be beyond it one bit. \n \n \"My grandfather wass not half a mile out of Cornwall, which was only a little place in those days, when two of the turnkeys came after him. \n \n \"\u0027Stop, Mr. McTavish,\u0027 says the turnkeys. \n \n \"\u0027What for would I stop?\u0027 says my grandfather. \n \n \"\u0027You have broke your bail,\u0027 says they. \n \n \"\u0027It\u0027s a lie for you,\u0027 says my grandfather, for his temper flared up for anybody to say he would broke his bail. \u0027Am I beyond the post?\u0027 says my grandfather. \n \n \"With that they run in on him, only that he knocked the two of them over with the post, and went on rejoicing, like an honest man should, at keeping his word and overcoming them that would slander his good name. The only thing pesides thoughts of the child that troubled him was questioning whether he had been strictly right in turning round for to use the post to defend himself in such a way that it was nearer the jail than what he wass. But when he remembered how the jailer never complained of prisoners of the limits chumping ofer the posts, if so they chumped back again in a moment, the trouble went out of his mind. \n HE KNOCKED THE TWO OF THEM OVER WITH THE POST \n HE KNOCKED THE TWO OF THEM OVER WITH THE POST \n \n \"Pretty soon after that he met Tuncan Macdonnell of Greenfields, coming into Cornwall with the wagon. \n \n \"\u0027And how is this, Glengatchie?\u0027 says Tuncan. \u0027For you were never the man to broke your bail.\u0027 \n \n \"Glengatchie, you\u0027ll understand, sir, is the name of my grandfather\u0027s farm. \n \n \"\u0027Never fear, Greenfields,\u0027 says my grandfather, \u0027for I\u0027m not beyond the post.\u0027 \n \n \"So Greenfields looked at the post, and he looked at my grandfather, and he scratched his head a wee, and he seen it was so; and then he fell into a great admiration entirely. \n \n \"\u0027Get in with me, Glengatchie—it\u0027s proud I\u0027ll be to carry you home\u0027; and he turned his team around. My grandfather did so, taking great care to keep the post in front of him all the time; and that way he reached home. Out comes my grandmother running to embrace him; but she had to throw her arms around the post and my grandfather\u0027s neck at the same time, he was that strict to be within his promise. Pefore going ben the house, he went to the back end of the kale-yard which was farthest from the jail, and there he stuck the post; and then he went back to see his sick child, while all the neighbors that came round was glad to see what a wise thought the saints had put into his mind to save his bail and his promise. \n \n \"So there he stayed a week till my father got well. Of course the constables came after my grandfather, but the settlement would not let the creatures come within a mile of Glengatchie. You might think, sir, that my grandfather would have stayed with his wife and weans, seeing the post was all the time in the kale-yard, and him careful not to go beyond it; but he was putting the settlement to a great deal of trouble day and night to keep the constables off, and he was fearful that they might take the post away, if ever they got to Glengatchie, and give him the name of false, that no McTavish ever had. So Tuncan Greenfields and ?neas Sandfield drove my grandfather back to the jail, him with the post behind him in the wagon, so as he would be between it and the jail. Of course Tougal Stewart tried his best to have the bail declared forfeited; but old Judge Jones only laughed, and said my grandfather was a Hielan\u0027 gentleman, with a very nice sense of honor, and that was chust exactly the truth. \n \n \"How did my grandfather get free in the end? Oh, then, that was because of Tougal Stewart being careless—him that thought he knew so much of the law. The law was, you will mind, that Tougal had to pay five shillings a week for keeping my grandfather in the limits. The money wass to be paid efery Monday, and it wass to be paid in lawful money of Canada, too. Well, would you belief that Tougal paid in four shillings in silver one Monday, and one shilling in coppers, for he took up the collection in church the day pefore, and it wass not till Tougal had gone away that the jailer saw that one of the coppers was a Brock copper,—a medal, you will understand, made at General Brock\u0027s death, and not lawful money of Canada at all. With that the jailer came out to my grandfather. \n \n \"\u0027Mr. McTavish,\u0027 says he, taking off his hat, \u0027you are a free man, and I\u0027m glad of it.\u0027 Then he told him what Tougal had done. \n \n \"\u0027I hope you will not have any hard feelings toward me, Mr. McTavish,\u0027 said the jailer; and a decent man he wass, for all that there wass not a drop of Hielan\u0027 blood in him. \u0027I hope you will not think hard of me for not being hospitable to you, sir,\u0027 says he; \u0027but it\u0027s against the rules and regulations for the jailer to be offering the best he can command to the prisoners. Now that you are free, Mr. McTavish,\u0027 says the jailer, \u0027I would be a proud man if Mr. McTavish of Glengatchie would do me the honor of taking supper with me this night. I will be asking your leave to invite some of the gentlemen of the place, if you will say the word, Mr. McTavish,\u0027 says he. \n \n \"Well, my grandfather could never bear malice, the kind man he was, and he seen how bad the jailer felt, so he consented, and a great company came in, to be sure, to celebrate the occasion. \n \n \"Did my grandfather pay the balance on the plough? What for should you suspicion, sir, that my grandfather would refuse his honest debt? Of course he paid for the plough, for the crop was good that fall. \n \n \"\u0027I would be paying you the other half of the plough now, Mr. Stewart,\u0027 says my grandfather, coming in when the store was full. \n \n \"\u0027Hoich, but YOU are the honest McTavish!\u0027 says Tougal, sneering. \n \n \"But my grandfather made no answer to the creature, for he thought it would be unkind to mention how Tougal had paid out six pounds four shillings and eleven pence to keep him in on account of a debt of two pound five that never was due till it was paid.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1867/54027.html","bookId":822,"book":{"id":822,"title":"Old Man Savarin Stories","description":"简介： Yes, indeed, my grandfather wass once in jail, said old Mrs. McTavish, of the county of Glengarry, in Ontario, Canada; but that wass for debt, and he wass a ferry honest man whateffer, and he would not broke his promiseno, not for all the money in Ca...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1867","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:35 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:35 AM"}}
