{"id":19204,"no":18,"title":"MISS MINNELY\u0027S MANAGEMENT","content":"I \\n\\n \\n\\n George Renwick substituted \"limb\" for \"leg,\" \"intoxicated\" for \"drunk,\" and \"undergarment\" for \"shirt,\" in \"The Converted Ringmaster,\" a short-story-of-commerce, which he was editing for \"The Family Blessing.\" When he should have eliminated all indecorum it would go to Miss Minnely, who would \"elevate the emotional interest.\" She was sole owner of \"The Blessing,\" active director of each of its multifarious departments. Few starry names rivalled hers in the galaxy of American character-builders. \\n\\n \\n\\n Unaware of limitations to her versatility, Miss Minnely might have dictated all the literary contents of the magazine, but for her acute perception that other gifted pens should be enlisted. Hence many minor celebrities worshipped her liberal cheques, whilst her more extravagant ones induced British titled personages to assuage the yearning of the American Plain People for some contact with rank. \\n\\n \\n\\n Renwick wrought his changes sardonically, applying to each line a set of touchstones—\"Will it please Mothers?\" \"Lady school-teachers?\" \"Ministers of the Gospel?\" \"Miss Minnely\u0027s Taste?\" He had not entirely converted The Ringmaster when his door was gently opened by the Chief Guide to the Family Blessing Building. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Durley had grown grey under solemn sense of responsibility for impressions which visitors might receive. With him now appeared an unusually numerous party of the usual mothers, spinsters, aged good men, and anxious children who keep watch and ward over \"The Blessing\u0027s\" pages, in devotion to Miss Minnely\u0027s standing editorial request that \"subscribers will faithfully assist the Editors with advice, encouragement, or reproof.\" The Mature, with true American gentleness, let the Young assemble nearest the open door. All necks craned toward Renwick. Because Mr. Durley\u0027s discourse to so extensive a party was unusually loud, Renwick heard, for the first time, what the Chief Guide was accustomed to murmur at his threshold: \"De-ar friends, the gentleman we now have the satisfaction of beholding engaged in a sitting posture at his editorial duties, is Mr. George Hamilton Renwick, an American in every——.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He looks like he might be English,\" observed a matron. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Durley took a steady look at Renwick: \"He is some red complected, Lady, but I guess it\u0027s only he is used to out of doors.\" He resumed his customary drone:—\"Mr. Renwick, besides he is American in every fibre of his being, is a first rate general purpose editor, and also a noted authority on yachting, boating, canoeing, rowing, swimming, and every kind of water amusements of a kind calculated to build up character in subscribers. Mr. George Hamilton Renwick\u0027s engagement by \u0027The Family Blessing\u0027 exclusively is a recent instance of many evidences that Miss Minnely, the Sole Proprietress, spares no expense in securing talented men of genius who are likewise authorities on every kind of specialty interesting, instructive, and improving to first-class respectable American families. Ladies and gentlemen, and de-ar children, girls, and youths, we will now pass on to Room Number Sixteen, and behold Mr. Caliphas C. Cummins, the celebrated author and authority on Oriental and Scriptural countries. Mr. Cummins is specially noted as the author of \u0027Bijah\u0027s Bicycle in Babylonia,\u0027 \u0027A Girl Genius at Galilee,\u0027 and many first-class serials published exclusively in \u0027The Family Blessing.\u0027 He may——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Durley softly closed Renwick\u0027s door. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Improving Editor, now secluded, stared wrathfully for some moments. Then he laughed, seized paper, and wrote in capitals:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When the editor in this compartment is to be exhibited, please notify him by knocking on this door before opening it. He will then rise from his sitting posture, come forward for inspection, and turn slowly round three times, if a mother, a school teacher, or a minister of the Gospel be among the visiting subscribers.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Renwick strode to his door. While pinning the placard on its outside he overheard the concluding remarks of Mr. Durley on Mr. Cummins, whose room was next in the long corridor: \"Likewise talented editor of the Etiquette Department and the Puzzle Department. Mr. Cummins, Sir, seven lady teachers from the State of Maine are now honouring us in this party.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Renwick stood charmed to listen. He heard the noted author clack forward to shake hands all round meantime explaining in thin, high, affable volubility: \"My de-ar friends, you have the good fortune to behold me in the very act of composing my new serial of ten Chapters, for \u0027The Blessing\u0027 exclusively, entitled \u0027Jehu and Jerusha in Jerusalem,\u0027 being the experiences of a strenuous New England brother and sister in the Holy Land, where our Lord innogerated the Christian religion, now, sad to say, under Mohammetan subjection. In this tale I am incorporating largely truthful incidents of my own and blessed wife\u0027s last visit to the Holy Places where——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Renwick slammed his door. He flung his pen in a transport of derision. Rebounding from his desk, it flew through an open window, perhaps to fall on some visitor to \"The Blessing\u0027s\" lawn. He hastened to look down. Nobody was on gravel path or bench within possible reach of the missile. Renwick, relieved, mused anew on the singularities of the scene. \\n\\n \\n\\n The vast \"Blessing\" Building stands amid a city block devoted largely to shaven turf, flower beds, grassed mounds, and gravel paths. It is approached from the street by a broad walk which bifurcates at thirty yards from the \"Richardson\" entrance, to surround a turfed truncated cone, from which rises a gigantic, severely draped, female figure. It is that bronze of Beneficence which, in the words of the famous New England sculptress, Miss Angela C. Amory Pue, \"closely features Miss Martha Minnely in her grand early womanhood.\" In the extensive arms of the Beneficence a bronze volume so slants that spectators may read on its back, in gilt letters, \"THE FAMILY BLESSING.\" Prettily pranked out in dwarf marginal plants on the turfy cone these words are pyramided: \"LOVE. HEAVEN. BENEFICENCE. THE LATEST FASHIONS. MY COUNTRY, \u0027TIS OF THEE.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Not far from the statue slopes a great grassed mound which displays still more conspicuously in \"everlastings,\" \"THE FAMILY BLESSING. CIRCULATION 1915, 1,976,709. MONTHLY. COME UNTO ME ALL YE WEARY AND HEAVILY LADEN. TWO DOLLARS A YEAR.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The scheme ever puzzled Renwick. Had some demure humour thus addressed advertisements as if to the eternal stars? Or did they proceed from a pure simplicity of commercial taste? From this perennial problem he was diverted by sharp rapping at his door. Durley again? But the visitor was Mr. Joram B. Buntstir, veteran among the numerous editors of \"The Blessing,\" yet capable of jocularities. He appeared perturbed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Renwick, you are rather fresh here, and I feel so friendly to you that I\u0027d hate to see you get into trouble unwarned. Surely you can\u0027t wish Miss Minnely to see that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What? Oh, the placard! That\u0027s for Durley. He must stop exhibiting me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Durley won\u0027t understand. Anyway, he couldn\u0027t stop without instructions from Miss Minnely. He will take the placard to her for orders. You do not wish to hurt Miss Minnely\u0027s feelings, I am sure.\" Mr. Buntstir closed the door behind him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bah—Miss Minnely\u0027s feelings can\u0027t be so tender as all that!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, eh? Do you know her so thoroughly?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know her at all. I\u0027ve been here three months without once seeing Miss Minnely. Is she real? Half the time I doubt her existence.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You get instructions from her regularly.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I get typewritten notes, usually voluminous, signed \u0027M. Minnely,\u0027 twice a week. But the Business Manager, or Miss Heartly, may dictate them, for all I know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pshaw! Miss Minnely presides in seclusion. Her private office has a street entrance. She seldom visits the Departments in office hours. Few of her staff know her by sight. She saves time by avoiding personal interviews. But she keeps posted on everybody\u0027s work. I hope you may not have to regret learning how very real Miss Minnely can be. She took me in hand, once, eight years ago. I have been careful to incur no more discipline since—kind as she was. If she sees your placard——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, what?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, she can be very impressive. I fear your offer to turn round before visitors may bring you trouble.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am looking for trouble. I\u0027m sick and tired of this life of intellectual shame.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then quit!\" snapped Buntstir, pierced. \"Be consistent. Get out. Sell your sneers at a great established publication to some pamphlet periodical started by college boys for the regeneration of Literature. Don\u0027t jeer what you live by. That is where intellectual shame should come in.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are right. A man should not gibe his job. I must quit. The \u0027Blessing\u0027 is all right for convinced devotees of the mawkish. But if a man thinks sardonically of his daily work, that damns the soul.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It may be an effect of the soul trying to save itself,\" said Buntstir, mollified. \"Anyway, Renwick, remember your trouble with \u0027The Reflex.\u0027 Avoid the name of a confirmed quitter. Stay here till you can change to your profit. Squealing won\u0027t do us any good. A little grain of literary conscience ought not to make you talk sour. It\u0027s cynical to satirize our bread and butter—imprudent, too.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s right. I\u0027ll swear off, or clear out. Lord, how I wish I could. My brain must rot if I don\u0027t. \u0027The Blessing\u0027s\u0027 \u0027emotional\u0027! Oh, Buntstir, the stream of drivel! And to live by concocting it for trustful subscribers. Talk of the sin of paregoricking babies!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Babies take paregoric because they like it. Pshaw, Renwick, you\u0027re absurdly sensitive. Writing-men must live, somehow—usually by wishy-washiness. Unpleasant work is the common lot of mankind. Where\u0027s your title to exemption? Really, you\u0027re lucky. Miss Minnely perceives zest in your improvements of copy. She says you are naturally gifted with \u0027The Blessing\u0027s\u0027 taste.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"For Heaven\u0027s sake, Buntstir!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She did—Miss Heartly told me so. And yet—if she sees that placard—no one can ever guess what she may do in discipline. You can\u0027t wish to be bounced, dear boy, with your family to provide for. Come, you\u0027ve blown off steam. Take the placard off your door.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right. I will. But Miss Minnely can\u0027t bounce me without a year\u0027s notice. That\u0027s how I engaged.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A year\u0027s notice to quit a life of intellectual shame!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, it is one thing to jump out of the window, and another to be bounced. I wouldn\u0027t stand that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Buntstir laughed. \"I fancy I see you, you sensitive Cuss, holding on, or jumping off or doing anything contra to Miss Minnely\u0027s intention.\" He went to the door. \"Hello, where\u0027s the placard?\" he cried, opening it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Gone!\" Renwick sprang up. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Gone, sure. No matter how. It is already in Miss Minnely\u0027s hands. Well, I told you to take it down twenty minutes ago.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wait, Buntstir. What is best to be done?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hang on for developments—and get to work.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Buntstir vanished as one hastens to avoid infection. \\n\\n \\n\\n II \\n\\n \\n\\n Renwick resumed his editing of \"The Converted Ringmaster\" with resolve to think on nothing else. But, between his eyes and the manuscript, came the woeful aspect of two widows, his mother and his sister, as they had looked six months earlier, when he threw up his political editorship of \"The Daily Reflex\" in disgust at its General Manager\u0027s sudden reversal of policy. His sister\u0027s baby toddled into the vision. He had scarcely endured to watch the child\u0027s uncertain steps during the weeks while he wondered how to buy its next month\u0027s modified milk. To \"The Reflex\" he could not return, because he had publicly burned his boats, with the desperate valour of virtue conscious that it may weaken if strained by need for family food. \\n\\n \\n\\n Out of that dangerous hole he had been lifted by the Sole Proprietress of \"The Family Blessing.\" She praised his \"public stand for principle\" in a note marked \"strictly confidential,\" which tendered him a \"position.\" He had secretly laughed at the cautious, amiable offer, even while her laudation gratified his self-importance. Could work on \"The Blessing\" seem otherwise than ridiculous for one accustomed to chide presidents, monarchs, bosses, bankers, railway magnates? But it was well paid, and seemed only too easy. The young man did not foresee for himself that benumbing of faculty which ever punishes the writer who sells his facility to tasks below his ambition. At worst \"The Blessing\" seemed harmless. Nor could his better nature deny a certain esteem to that periodical which affectionate multitudes proclaimed to be justly named. \\n\\n \\n\\n Renwick, viewing himself once more as a recreant breadwinner, cursed his impetuous humour. But again he took heart from remembrance of his engagement by the year, little suspecting his impotency to hold on where snubs must be the portion of the unwanted. Twelve months to turn round in! But after? What if an editor, already reputed impractical by \"The Reflex\" party, should be refused employment everywhere, after forsaking \"The Blessing\" office, in which \"positions\" were notoriously sought or coveted by hundreds of \"literary\" aspirants to \"soft snaps\"? So his veering imagination whirled round that inferno into which wage earners descend after hazarding their livelihood. \\n\\n \\n\\n From this disquiet he sprang when his door was emphatically knocked. It opened. Mr. Durley reappeared with a throng closely resembling the last, except for one notable wide lady in street costume of Quakerish gray. Her countenance seemed to Renwick vaguely familiar. The fabric and cut of her plain garb betokened nothing of wealth to the masculine eye, but were regarded with a degree of awe by the other ladies present. She appeared utterly American, yet unworldly, in the sense of seeming neither citified, suburbanish, nor rural. The experienced placidity of her countenance reminded Renwick of a familiar composite photograph of many matrons chosen from among \"The Blessing\u0027s\" subscribers. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Her peculiarity is that of the perfect type,\" he pondered while listening to Durley\u0027s repetition of his previous remarks. \\n\\n \\n\\n At their close, he briskly said: \"Mr. Renwick, Sir, Miss Minnely wishes you to know that your kind offer is approved. We are now favoured with the presence of four mothers, six lady teachers, and a minister of the Gospel.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Renwick flushed. His placard approved! It promised that he would come forward and turn round thrice for inspection. Durley had received instructions to take him at his word! Suddenly the dilemma touched his facile humour. Explanation before so many was impossible. Gravely he approached the visitors, held out the skirts of his sack coat, turned slowly thrice, and bowed low at the close. \\n\\n \\n\\n The large lady nodded with some reserve. Other spectators clearly regarded the solemnity as part of \"The Blessing\u0027s\" routine. Mr. Durley resumed his professional drone:—\"We will now pass on to Room Number Sixteen, and behold Mr. Caliphas C. Cummins in——\" Renwick\u0027s door closed. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then the large lady, ignoring the attractions of Mr. Cummins, went to the waiting elevator, and said \"down.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Renwick, again at his desk, tried vainly to remember of what or whom the placid lady had reminded him. A suspicion that she might be Miss Minnely fled before recollection of her street costume. Still—she might be. If so—had his solemnly derisive posturing offended her? She had given no sign. How could he explain his placard to her? Could he not truly allege objections to delay of his work by Durley\u0027s frequent interruptions? He was whirling with conjecture and indecision when four measured ticks from a lead pencil came on his outer door. \\n\\n \\n\\n There stood Miss Heartly, Acting Manager of the Paper Patterns Department. Her light blue eyes beamed the confidence of one born trustful, and confirmed in the disposition by thirty-five years of popularity at home, in church, in office. In stiff white collar, lilac tie, trig grey gown, and faint, fading bloom of countenance, she well represented a notable latter day American type, the Priestess of Business, one born and bred as if to endow office existence with some almost domestic touch of Puritan nicety. That no man might sanely hope to disengage Miss Heartly from devotion to \"The Family Blessing\" was as if revealed by her unswerving directness of gaze in speech. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have called, Mr. Renwick, by instruction of the Sole Proprietress. Miss Minnely wishes me, first, to thank you for this.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was the placard! \\n\\n \\n\\n Renwick stared, unable to credit the sincerity in her face and tone. She must be making game of him while she spoke in measured links, as if conscientiously repeating bits each separately memorized: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Renwick—Miss Minnely desires you to know that she has been rarely more gratified—than by this evidence—that your self-identification with \u0027The Blessing\u0027—is cordial and complete. But—Miss Minnely is inclined to hope—that your thoughtful and kind proposal—of turning round for inspection—may be—modified—or improved. For instance—if you would carefully prepare—of course for revision by her own taste—a short and eloquent welcoming discourse—to visitors—that could be elevated to an attraction—for subscribers—of that she is almost, though not yet quite, fully assured. Miss Minnely presumes, Mr. Renwick, that you have had the pleasure of—hearing Mr. Cummins welcome visitors. Of course, Mr. Renwick, Miss Minnely would not have asked you—but—as you have volunteered—in your cordial willingness—that affords her an opportunity—for the suggestion. But, Mr. Renwick, if you do not like the idea—then Miss Minnely would not wish—to pursue the suggestion further.\" A child glad to have repeated its lesson correctly could not have looked more ingenuous. \\n\\n \\n\\n In her fair countenance, open as a daybook, Renwick could detect no guile. Her tone and figure suggested curiously some flatness, as of the Paper Patterns of her Department. But through this mild deputy Miss Minnely must, he conceived, be deriding him. With what subtlety the messenger had been chosen! It seemed at once necessary and impossible to explain his placard to one so guiltless of humour. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hoped it might be understood that I did not intend that placard to be taken literally, Miss Heartly.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not literally!\" she seemed bewildered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To be pointed at as \u0027a first class general purpose editor\u0027 is rather too much, don\u0027t you think?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know, Mr. Renwick,\" she spoke sympathetically. \"It sort of got onto your humility, I presume. But Miss Minnely thinks you are first class, or she would never have instructed Mr. Durley to say first class. That is cordial to you, and good business—to impress the visitors, I mean.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Miss Minnely is very appreciative and kind. But the point is that I did not engage to be exhibited to flocks of gobemouches.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Miss Heartly pondered the term. \"Please, Mr. Renwick, what are gobemouches?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I should have said The Plain People.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps there have been rude ones—not subscribers,\" she said anxiously. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, all have acted as if reared on \u0027The Blessing.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She sighed in relief—then exclaimed in consternation:—\"Can Mr. Durley have been—rude?\" She hesitated to pronounce the dire word. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not at all, Miss Heartly. I do not blame Mr. Durley for exhibiting us as gorillas.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But how wrong.\" There was dismay in her tone. \"Miss Minnely has warned him against the least bit of deception.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, please, Miss Heartly—I was speaking figuratively.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Her fair brow slightly wrinkled, her fingers went nervously to her anxious lips, she looked perplexed;—\"Figuratively! If you would kindly explain, Mr. Renwick. I am not very literary.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do the ladies of the Paper Patterns Department like to be exhibited?\" he ventured. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I could not exactly be warranted to say \u0027like\u0027—Scripture has such warnings against the sinfulness of vanity. But we are, of course, cordially pleased to see visitors—it is so good for the Subscription Department.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I see. And it is not hard on you individually. There you are, a great roomful of beautiful, dutiful, cordial young ladies. You keep one another in countenance. But what if you were shown each in a separate cage?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Her face brightened. \"Oh, now I understand, Mr. Renwick! You mean it would be nicer for the Editors, too, to be seen all together.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Renwick sighed hopelessly. She spoke on decisively: \"That may be a valuable suggestion, Mr. Renwick.\" On her pad she began pencilling shorthand. \"Of course I will credit you with it. Perhaps you do not know that Miss Minnely always pays well for valuable suggestions.\" She wrote intently, murmuring: \"But is it practicable? Let me think. Why, surely practicable! But Miss Minnely will decide. All partitions on the Editorial Flat could be removed! Make it cool as Prize Package or Financial Department!\" She looked up from her paper, glowing with enterprise, and pointed her pencil straight at Renwick. \"And so impressive!\" She swept the pencil in a broad half circle, seeing her picture. \"Thirty Editors visible at one comprehensive glance! All so literary, and busy, and intelligent, and cordial! Fine! I take the liberty, temporarily, of calling that a first-class suggestion, Mr. Renwick. It may be worth hundreds to you, if Miss Minnely values it. It may be forcibly felt in the Subscription List—if Miss Minnely approves. It may help to hold many subscribers who try to get away after the first year. I feel almost sure Miss Minnely will approve. I am so glad. I thought something important was going to come when Miss Minnely considered your placard so carefully.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But some of the other Editors may not wish to be exhibited with the whole collection,\" said Renwick gravely. \"For instance, consider Mr. Cummins\u0027 literary rank. Would it gratify him to be shown as a mere unit among Editors of lesser distinction?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are most fore-thoughtful on every point, Mr. Renwick. That is so fine. But Mr. Cummins is also most devoted. I feel sure he would cordially yield, if Miss Minnely approved. I presume you will wish me to tell her that you are grateful for her kind message?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Cordially grateful seems more fitting. Miss Heartly—and I am—especially for her choice of a deputy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank you, Mr. Renwick. I will tell her that, too. And may I say that you will be pleased to adopt her suggestion that you discourse a little to visitors, pending possible changes in this Flat, instead of just coming forward and turning around. Literary men are so clever—and—ready.\" He fleetingly suspected her of derision. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Please say that I will reflect on Miss Minnely\u0027s suggestion with an anxious wish to emulate, so far as my fallen nature will permit, Miss Heartly\u0027s beautiful devotion to \u0027The Blessing\u0027s\u0027 interests.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, thank you again, so much, Mr. Renwick.\" And the fair Priestess of Business bowed graciously in good bye. \\n\\n \\n\\n III \\n\\n \\n\\n Renwick sat dazed. From his earliest acquaintance with \"The Family Blessing\" he had thought of its famous Editress and Sole Proprietress as one \"working a graft\" on the Plain People by consummate sense of the commercial value of cordial cant. Now he had to conceive of her as perfectly ingenuous. Had she really taken his placard as one written in good faith? He remembered its sentences clearly: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When the editor in this compartment is to be exhibited, please notify him by knocking on this door before opening it. He will then rise from his sitting posture, come forward for inspection, and turn slowly around three times if a school teacher, a mother, or a minister of the Gospel be among the visiting subscribers.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Miss Minnely took that for sincere! Renwick began to regard \"The Blessing\" as an emanation of a soul so simple as to be incapable of recognizing the diabolic element, derision. He was conceiving a tenderness for the honesty which could read his placard as one of sincerity. How blessed must be hearts innocent of mockery! Why should he not gratify them by discoursing to visiting subscribers? The idea tickled his fancy. At least he might amuse himself by writing what would edify Durley\u0027s parties if delivered with gravity. He might make material of some of Miss Minnely\u0027s voluminous letters of instruction to himself. From his pigeon-hole he drew that file, inspected it rapidly, laughed, and culled as he wrote. \\n\\n \\n\\n Twenty minutes later he was chuckling over the effusion, after having once read its solemnities aloud to himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hang me if I don\u0027t try it on Durley\u0027s next party!\" he was telling himself, when pencil tickings, like small woodpecker tappings, came again on his outer door. \"Miss Heartly back! I will treat her to it!\" and he opened the door, discourse in hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n There stood the wide, wise-eyed, placid, gray-clad lady! \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am Miss Minnely, Mr. Renwick. Very pleased to introduce myself to a gentleman whose suggestion has pleased me deeply.\" Her wooly voice was as if steeped in a syrup of cordial powers. Suddenly he knew she had reminded him of Miss Pue\u0027s gigantic bronze Beneficence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank you, Miss Minnely. I feel truly honoured.\" Renwick, with some concealed trepidation, bowed her to his revolving chair. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Renwick.\" She disposed her amplitude comfortably; then streamed on genially and authoritatively, \"You may be gratified to learn that I was pleased—on the whole—by your cordial demeanour while—er—revolving—not long ago—on the occasion of Mr. Durley\u0027s last visiting party. Only—you will permit me to say this in all kindness—I did not regard the—the display of—er—form—as precisely adapted. Otherwise your appearance, tone, and manner were eminently suitable—indeed such as mark you strongly, Mr. Renwick, as conforming—almost—to my highest ideal for the conduct of Editors of \u0027The Blessing.\u0027 Consequently I deputed Miss Heartly—with a suggestion. She has informed me of your cordial willingness, Mr. Renwick—hence I am here to thank you again—and instruct. Your short discourse to visitors will—let me explain—not only edify, but have the effect of, as it were, obviating any necessity for the—er—revolving—and the display of—er—form. Now, you are doubtless aware that I invariably edit, so to speak, every single thing done on behalf of our precious \u0027Family Blessing.\u0027 For due performance of that paramount duty I must give account hereafter. My peculiar gift is Taste—you will understand that I mention this fact with no more personal vanity that if I mentioned that I have a voice, hands, teeth, or any other endowment from my Creator—our Creator, in fact. Taste—true sense of what our subscribers like on their higher plane. My great gift must be entitled to direct what we say to visitors, just as it directs what \u0027The Blessing\u0027 publishes on its story pages, its editorial columns, its advertisements, letter heads, everything of every kind done in \u0027The Blessing\u0027s\u0027 name. I am thorough. And so, Mr. Renwick, I desire to hear your discourse beforehand. What? You have already prepared it? Excellent! Promptitude—there are few greater business virtues! We will immediately use your draft as a basis for further consultation.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n So imposing was her amiable demeanour that Renwick had no wish but to comply. He glanced over what he had written, feeling now sure that its mock gravity would seem nowise sardonic to Miss Minnely. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In preparing these few words,\" he remarked, \"I have borrowed liberally from your notes of instruction to me, Miss Minnely.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very judicious. Pray give me the pleasure.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He tendered the draft. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But no, please deliver it.\" She put away the paper. \"Suppose me to be a party of our de-ar visiting subscribers. I will stand here, you there. Now do not hesitate to be audible, Mr. Renwick.\" She beamed as a Brobdignagian child at a new game. \\n\\n \\n\\n Renwick, quick to all humours, took position, and began with unction: \"Dear friends, dear visitors——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She interrupted amiably:—\"De-ar friends, de-ar visitors. Make two syllables of the de-ar. The lingering is cordial in effect. I have observed that carefully—de-ar softens hearts. Dwell on the word—dee-ar—thus you will cause a sense of affectionate regard to cling to visitors\u0027 memories of \u0027The Blessing\u0027s\u0027 editorial staff. You understand, Mr. Renwick?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He began again: \"De-ar friends, de-ar visitors, de-ar mothers, de-ar teachers,\" but again she gently expostulated, holding up a fat hand to stop his voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Please, Mr. Renwick—no, I think not—it might seem invidious to discriminate by specifying some before others. All alike are our de-ar friends and visitors.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"De-ar friends, de-ar visitors,\" Renwick corrected his paper, \"I cannot hope to express adequately to you my feelings of delight in being introduced to your notice as a first class general purpose editor, and eminent authority on——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She graciously interposed:—\"It might be well to pencil this in, Mr. Renwick, \u0027introduced to you by our de-ar colleague, Mr. Durley, the most experienced of our guides to the \"Family Blessing\" Building, as general purpose editor, etc.\u0027 That would impress, as hinting at our corps of guides, besides uplifting the rank of our valued colleague, Mr. Durley, and by consequence \u0027The Blessing,\u0027 through the respectful mention made of one of our more humble employees. Elevate the lowly, and you elevate all the superior classes—that is a sound American maxim. In business it is by such fine attention to detail that hearts and therefore subscribers are won. But, Mr. Renwick, nothing could be better than your \u0027I cannot hope to express adequately my feelings of delight,\u0027 etc.—that signifies cordial emotion—it is very good business, indeed.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Sincerity was unclouded in her gaze. He pencilled in her amendment, and read on:—\"and eminent authority on water amusements of a character to build up character in first-class respectable American families.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very good—I drilled Mr. Durley in that,\" she put in complacently. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dear friends,\" he resumed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"De-ar,\" she reminded him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"De-ar friends, you may naturally desire to be informed of the nature of the duties of a general purpose editor, therefore——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let me suggest again, Mr. Renwick. Better say \u0027Dear friends, closely associated with \"The Family Blessing,\" as all must feel who share the privilege of maintaining it, you will naturally desire to be informed,\u0027 etc. Don\u0027t you agree, Mr. Renwick? It is well to neglect no opportunity for deepening the sense of our de-ar subscribers that the \u0027Blessing\u0027 is a privilege to their households. I do everything possible to make our beloved ones feel that they own \u0027The Blessing,\u0027 as in the highest sense they do. They like that. It is remunerative, also.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Renwick jotted in the improvement, and read on: \"A general purpose editor of \u0027The Blessing\u0027 is simply one charged with promoting the general purpose of \u0027The Blessing.\u0027 To explain what that is I cannot do better than employ the words of the Sole Proprietress, Miss Minnely herself, and——.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The lady suggested, \"I cannot do so well as to employ the words of—it is always effective to speak most respectfully of the absent Proprietress—that touches their imagination favourably. It is good business.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I appreciate it, Miss Minnely. And now I venture to adapt, verbatim, parts of your notes to me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It was forethoughtful to preserve them, Mr. Renwick. I am cordially pleased.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He read on more oratorically:—\"De-ar friends, \u0027The Blessing\u0027 has a Mission, and to fulfil that Mission it must, first of all, entertain its subscribers on their higher plane. This cannot be done by stimulating in them any latent taste for coarse and inelegant laughter, but by furnishing entertainingly the wholesome food from which mental pabulum is absorbed and mental growth accomplished.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Excellent! My very own words.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The varieties of this entertaining pabulum must be conscientiously prepared, and administered in small quantities so that each can be assimilated unconsciously by Youth and Age without mental mastication. Mind is not Character, and——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How true. Character-building publications must never be addressed to mere Mind.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The uplifting of the Mind, or Intellect,\" Renwick read on, \"is not the general purpose of \u0027The Family Blessing.\u0027 It is by the Literature of the Heart that Character is uplifted. Therefore a general purpose editor of \u0027The Blessing\u0027 must ever seek to maintain and to present the truly cordial. That is what most widely attracts and pleases all these sections of the great American people who are uncorrupted by worldly and literary associations which tend to canker the Soul with cynicism.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I remember my glow of heart in writing those inspiring, blessed, and inspired words!\" she exclaimed. \"Moreover, they are true. Now, I think that is about enough, Mr. Renwick. Visitors should never be too long detained by a single attraction. Let me advise you to memorize the discourse carefully. It is cordial. It is impressive. It is informative of \u0027The Blessing\u0027s\u0027 ideal. It utters my own thoughts in my own language. It is admirably adapted to hold former subscribers, and to confirm new. All is well.\" She pondered silently a few moments. \"Now, Mr. Renwick, I would be strictly just. The fact that an editor, and one of those not long gathered to our happy company, has suggested and devoted himself to this novel attraction, will have noblest effect in rousing our colleagues of every Department to emulative exertion. Once more, I thank you cordially. But the Sole Proprietress of the remunerative \u0027Blessing\u0027 holds her place in trust for all colleagues, and she is not disposed to retire with mere thanks to one who has identified himself so effectually with her and its ideals. Mr. Renwick, your honorarium—your weekly pay envelope,\" again she paused reflectively, \"it will hereafter rank you with our very valued colleague, Mr. Caliphas C. Cummins himself! No—no-no, Mr. Renwick—do not thank me—thank your happy inspiration—thank your cordial devotion—thank your Taste—thank your natural, innate identification, in high ideals, with me and \u0027The Family Blessing.\u0027 As for me—it is for me to thank you—and I do so, again, cordially, cordially, cordially!\" She beamed, the broad embodiment of Beneficence, in going out of the room. \\n\\n \\n\\n Renwick long stared, as one dazed, at the story of \"The Converted Ringmaster.\" It related in minute detail the sudden reformation of that sinful official. The account of his rapid change seemed no longer improbable nor mawkish. Any revolution in any mind might occur, since his own had been so swiftly hypnotized into sympathy with Miss Minnely and her emanation \"The Blessing.\" How generous she was! Grateful mist was in his eyes, emotion for the safety of the widows and the orphan whose bread he must win. \\n\\n \\n\\n Yet the derisive demon which sat always close to his too sophisticated heart was already gibing him afresh:—\"You stand engaged,\" it sneered, \"as assistant ringmaster to Durley\u0027s exhibition of yourself!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n New perception of Miss Minnely and Miss Heartly rose in his mind. Could mortal women be really as simple as those two ladies had seemed? Might it not be they had managed him with an irony as profound as the ingenuousness they had appeared to evince? \\n\\n \\n\\n The End \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1867/54043.html","bookId":822,"book":{"id":822,"title":"Old Man Savarin Stories","description":"简介： Yes, indeed, my grandfather wass once in jail, said old Mrs. McTavish, of the county of Glengarry, in Ontario, Canada; but that wass for debt, and he wass a ferry honest man whateffer, and he would not broke his promiseno, not for all the money in Ca...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1867","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:35 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:35 AM"}}
