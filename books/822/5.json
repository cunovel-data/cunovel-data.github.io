{"id":19191,"no":5,"title":"OLD MAN SAVARIN","content":"Old Ma\u0027ame Paradis had caught seventeen small doré, four suckers, and eleven channel-catfish before she used up all the worms in her tomato-can. Therefore she was in a cheerful and loquacious humor when I came along and offered her some of my bait. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Merci; non, M\u0027sieu. Dat\u0027s \u0027nuff fishin\u0027 for me. I got too old now for fish too much. You like me make you present of six or seven doré? Yes? All right. Then you make me present of one quarter dollar.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n When this transaction was completed, the old lady got out her short black clay pipe, and filled it with tabac blanc. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ver\u0027 good smell for scare mosquitoes,\" said she. \"Sit down, M\u0027sieu. For sure I like to be here, me, for see the river when she\u0027s like this.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Indeed the scene was more than picturesque. Her fishing-platform extended twenty feet from the rocky shore of the great Rataplan Rapid of the Ottawa, which, beginning to tumble a mile to the westward, poured a roaring torrent half a mile wide into the broader, calm brown reach below. Noble elms towered on the shores. Between their trunks we could see many whitewashed cabins, whose doors of blue or green, or red scarcely disclosed their colors in that light. \\n\\n \\n\\n The sinking sun, which already touched the river, seemed somehow the source of the vast stream that flowed radiantly from its blaze. Through the glamour of the evening mist and the maze of June flies we could see a dozen men scooping for fish from platforms like that of Ma\u0027ame Paradis. \\n\\n \\n\\n Each scooper lifted a great hoop-net set on a handle some fifteen feet long, threw it easily up stream, and swept it on edge with the current to the full length of his reach. Then it was drawn out and at once thrown upward again, if no capture had been made. In case he had taken fish, he came to the inshore edge of his platform, and upset the net\u0027s contents into a pool separated from the main rapid by an improvised wall of stones. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m too old for scoop some now,\" said Ma\u0027ame Paradis, with a sigh. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You were never strong enough to scoop, surely,\" said I. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, eh? All right, M\u0027sieu. Then you hain\u0027t nev\u0027 hear \u0027bout the time Old Man Savarin was catched up with. No, eh? Well, I\u0027ll tol\u0027 you \u0027bout that.\" And this was her story as she told it to me. \\n\\n \\n\\n * * * * * \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Der was fun dose time.

Well, for sure, I ain\u0027t so old like what I\u0027ll look. But Old Man Savarin was old already. He\u0027s old, old, old, when he\u0027s only thirty; an\u0027 mean—baptême!
