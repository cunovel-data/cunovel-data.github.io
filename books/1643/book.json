So when Xander\u0027s face appears on-screen at her Matching ceremony, Cassia knows with complete certainty that he is her ideal mate... until she sees Ky Markham\u0027s face flash for an instant before the screen fades to black. \n The Society tells her it\u0027s a glitch, a rare malfunction, and that she should focus on the happy life she\u0027s destined to lead with Xander. But Cassia can\u0027t stop thinking about Ky, and as they slowly fall in love, Cassia begins to doubt the Society\u0027s infallibility and is faced with an impossible choice: between Xander and Ky, between the only life she\u0027s known and a path that no one else has dared to follow.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/matched-matched-1.jpg","author":"Ally Condie","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":43,"category":{"id":7,"name":"Science Fiction","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
