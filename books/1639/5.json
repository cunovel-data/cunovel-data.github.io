Yes, I think I do. “I’l try to find you a steak.”\\n\\n CHAPTER TWO\\n\\n HUMANITY CAN NOW BREATHE AGAIN.\\n\\n THE COVENANT HAS FINALLY BEEN DRIVEN BACK.

RUTH CHARET, NEW PRESIDENT OF THE UNIFIED EARTH GOVERNMENT: JANUARY 2553)\\n\\n CORE 5, OFFICE OF NAVAL INTELLIGENCE, BRAVO-6 FACILITY: JANUARY 26, 2553.\\n\\n Don’t mind me. BB settled down to watch and learn. I’m no trouble at all. I’ll stay out of your way. I’m just observing.\\n\\n And he was observing a man who seemed to think his time had come, the idiot. Didn’t he realize the war was anything but over? David Agnoli, Minister for the Colonies, sat on the low oak bookcase with his back to Parangosky’s office. He stil didn’t seem to have the measure of UNSC yet.\\n\\n “Do you think the old bat’s ever going to die, Captain?” Agnoli reached down between his legs to pul out a volume at random, but BB was pretty sure he was keeping an eye on the office door via the reflection in the glass panel opposite. “Or wil she transmogrify into her true basilisk form, and vanish in a puff of sulfur? I’d pay good money to see that.”\\n\\n He started leafing through the book, a faded and ancient copy of The Admiralty Manual of Seamanship Vol. II. Captain Osman glanced at him with faint contempt.\\n\\n “The Admiral speaks very highly of you, too, David,” she said sourly. “I think the word was weasel. Wel , it began with a W, anyway.”\\n\\n “Come on, you’re the anointed one. You can get me in to see her, can’t you?”\\n\\n “If she’d known you were coming, I’m sure she would have made time for you. But she’s got a lot of souls to digest.” She gave him a look of faint disgust as he riffled through the yel owing pages. “Look, do you know how many centuries old that book is? Admiral Hood gave it to me. Don’t get greasy fingerprints al over it.”\\n\\n Agnoli turned to look over his shoulder as Parangosky’s door opened. Her flag lieutenant, Dorsey, hovered with his hands braced on the door frame as if he didn’t dare cross the threshold.\\n\\n “The Admiral wil see you now, Captain.” Dorsey made a polite show of noticing Agnoli. “Oh, hel o, Minister. Wil we be seeing you at Dr.\\n\\n Charet’s reception later?”\\n\\n “Possibly.” Agnoli closed the ancient book with exaggerated care and stood up to put it back on the shelf. He nodded at Osman as Dorsey vanished. “I’l show myself out, then. Perhaps the lieutenant can make an appointment for me.”\\n\\n Osman watched him until he was out of sight—but not out of BB’s—then reached out to pick up some files from her desk. BB decided it was time to introduce himself. He projected his three-dimensional holographic image into the doorway and waited for her to react.\\n\\n How else was an AI supposed to shake hands?\\n\\n Osman stopped in her tracks and stared at him. “And whose little pet are you?” She cocked her head a fraction as if she suddenly wasn’t quite sure what he was. “You are ful y sentient, aren’t you?”\\n\\n “I’m Black-Box,” he said. “I thought I’d introduce myself before we see the Admiral.”\\n\\n Osman looked him over with no change in her expression whatsoever. BB’s holographic avatar was a cube, a featureless box picked out in blue light, because he saw no point in masquerading as something other than what he was—pure intel ect, his intricate thought processes a closed book to organic life. He couldn’t bear the theatrics of manifesting as flesh and blood.\\n\\n Faces are for wannabes. I’m not a surrogate human.\\n\\n “You didn’t answer my question, Black-Box,” Osman said, waiting until he moved aside. “Whose AI are you?”\\n\\n He fol owed her for a few meters as she walked down the corridor, as far as he could project himself using her desk terminal. “I report to the Admiral. And she cal s me BB. You might like to as wel .”\\n\\n Osman looked over her shoulder to say something, but he’d run out of range and had to switch to another terminal. It took him a fraction of a second to reroute himself through the fire alarm system and the mainframe to project from Parangosky’s terminal and pop up again in front of Osman. She was in the process of turning around again to look for him. Judging by the way she flinched, he’d actual y managed to startle her.\\n\\n “Apologies, Captain,” he said. “As I was saying, I work for Parangosky.”\\n\\n “Doing what, exactly?”\\n\\n “Whatever she wants,” BB said.\\n\\n Look after Osman. Trust her. I’ve kept her under wraps for years, hidden her even from Halsey. She has a job to do. The Admiral thought the sun shone out of Osman’s backside, and even a dolt like Agnoli could see that she’d take over when Parangosky decided to cal it a day, even if he didn’t know why.\\n\\n And if it was good enough for Parangosky, then it was good enough for BB.\\n\\n Ah … Hogarth. An alert rippled through BB, detected by extensions of his program that he’d distributed throughout the communications and security systems in key government buildings. There he goes. He’s on the prowl. Even if Captain Hogarth hadn’t put a private appointment with the UEG in his diary, his comms handset made his movements trackable, and each secure door that he passed through betrayed his identity. He was moving around the president’s suite of offices. So you’re off to do some lobbying, are you? You really do fancy your chances as head of ONI.\\n\\n Shame that you’ve backed the wrong horse. What possible deal could the civilian government offer you?\\n\\n In the time it took BB to run al his monitoring systems and check intel igence reports from fifty ships, Osman had only just begun her instant reply.\\n\\n “I never knew she had an AI,” Osman said, walking straight through BB’s hologram into Parangosky’s office. Humans didn’t usual y do that to AIs. They’d walk around them. He wasn’t sure how to take it. “Wel , nice to meet you, BB.”\\n\\n Parangosky gave him a wink as he moved in behind Osman. “I see you two are getting to know each other,” she said, gesturing Osman to a seat. “That’s good. Don’t worry, Captain, you can trust BB with your life. Not a phrase I use lightly. Or figuratively.”\\n\\n “And am I going to need to, ma’am?” Osman asked.\\n\\n “Very possibly.” Parangosky leaned forward, slowly and painful y, to check the status panel on her desk. The office was secure, door seals shut and soundproofing activated. BB had his own defenses to keep unfriendly AIs out of the Admiral’s systems, but the benign dumb ones needed dissuasion too. He exploited them to spy and expected other AIs to do the same. “Which is why I decided that you needed your own AI. And why this conversation is strictly between you, me, and him.”\\n\\n Osman looked BB over, chewing her lip. He couldn’t tel if she was pleased with the appointment or not, but she certainly seemed a little uneasy.\\n\\n Everything he could observe told him so. He could infiltrate any electronic system and ride its vectors, seeing, hearing, and sensing far more than a limited human—even a Spartan—ever could. From the minute feedback adjustments in the environmental controls, he could detect how much CO2 Osman was exhaling. The security cameras enabled him to see her in any wavelength, including infrared. She looked rather flushed in that spectrum, which mirrored her increased respiration.\\n\\n Anxious, Captain?\\n\\n “Are we talking about Kilo-Five or something else?” Osman asked.\\n\\n “Something else.” Parangosky twisted a little in her seat as if she was trying to ease her arthritic hip. “I’l come on to the squad later. But this is about Catherine Halsey.”\\n\\n “You’ve found a body.”\\n\\n “Oh, she’s stil alive. I can feel it in my water. But, more to the point, Glamorgan’s ELINT has picked up something much more concrete.”\\n\\n Parangosky indicated the screen. “BB, do the honors, please.”\\n\\n BB pul ed up the files he’d col ected from the ONI corvette. The holographic display unfolded itself just over the desk between the two women, showing a chart of the system that once contained Onyx before the artificial planet had deconstructed itself. Slightly irregular concentric rings radiated out from the Onyx coordinates. One forlorn blue light was set within the red lines, a pinprick that marked a signal from a Spartan armor transponder, the only KIA that had been confirmed—Lieutenant Ambrose.\\n\\n BB had left a fragment of himself in Glamorgan’s system to alert him as soon as anything else was found. The corvette’s nav AI didn’t seem to mind the intrusion.\\n\\n “Sifting for debris out there is a slow process.” Parangosky reached into the display and enlarged the detail. “You know what it’s like. Hard to spot anything smal er than a family car. It’l take the rest of the year to complete a visual search, but Glamorgan’s picking up massive electromagnetic anomalies. Something’s stil there, but we can’t see it. And unless every single sensor’s malfunctioning, it’s enormous, the size of a solar system. We knew there were areas underground that we couldn’t access, but now we know that Onyx was whol y artificial, it’s starting to support the theory that it was built as a citadel. A last-chance saloon.”\\n\\n Osman was staring at the chart with a slightly openmouthed expression that told BB she was forming a theory. “That’s not any slipspace signature I’d recognize, but it looks a hel of a lot like it. Makes me wish I hadn’t sent a wreath.”\\n\\n “You didn’t. You may yet get the chance, though.”\\n\\n “Wel , it was only a matter of time before she found enough pieces to put together. You can’t keep that much information completely quiet for that long. But are you sure?”\\n\\n “Oh, I never assume anything where Halsey’s concerned, and she might wel actual y be dead, of course, planning or no planning. But there’s a logical progression.” Parangosky counted out on thin fingers, joints swol en despite her doctor’s best efforts. “We have the Onyx battle reports from Dusk. We know she kidnapped Spartan-Zero-Eight-Seven. We know she persuaded Hood to deploy Spartans to Onyx. And we know damn wel just how many Forerunner artifacts there were on that planet and what they might be. So she had her Spartans, and she had access to Forerunner technology. Now—your turn.”\\n\\n “So she jumped ship,” Osman said. “She’s used something the Forerunners left behind.”\\n\\n BB felt free to chip in with his own theories. “And after reading her journal, I think she’s cleansing her conscience by hiding her Spartans.”\\n\\n “That’s big of her. Hiding them from us?”\\n\\n “Who knows?” BB said. “The woman rewrites her own reality as she goes along.”\\n\\n Parangosky sucked in a breath. “Osman, she’s effectively abducted some very scarce special forces personnel as wel as Chief Mendez. She can steal al the paper clips she likes, but she does not get to strol off with bil ions of dol ars’ worth of UNSC resources in the middle of a battle. If she had a military rank, she’d have faced the death penalty for that. She stil might.”\\n\\n BB noted Osman nod involuntarily. There was no love lost there, and it wasn’t just because Osman had taken on her mentor’s loathing of Halsey.\\n\\n “When did you last have contact with her, Captain?” BB asked.\\n\\n “You already know that,” Osman said stiffly. “But if you don’t, then you ought to. When she discarded me as breakage from her program. That’s when.”\\n\\n “Just testing for potency of venom, Captain.…”\\n\\n “Savored cold and al that, BB. The best way.”\\n\\n Parangosky turned to BB and gave him her don’t-be-a-naughty-boy look, a rueful half smile. He suspected that Parangosky had been the kind of little girl who kept pet scorpions and doted on them the way other children cooed over puppies.\\n\\n “We don’t do pointless vengeance in ONI, BB,” Parangosky said gently. “We do vengeance with a pragmatic outcome in mind. Revenge might give you a warm feeling, but unless it delivers some lasting results you might as wel have a nice cup of mocha instead.”\\n\\n “So you want me to take Kilo-Five to Onyx,” Osman said, obviously in a hurry to move on from the personal stuff. “Or the gap where Onyx used to be. So who’s going to handle the Sangheili mission?”\\n\\n “That’s stil our top priority. We’ve got Elites to neutralize and the rest of the Halos to locate. Just stand by to divert to Glamorgan if and when we find something. Mendez and some of the Spartan-Threes could stil be alive too, but don’t forget you’re going to have Spartan-Zero-One-Zero in your squad, and she thinks that Halsey walks on water. They al do. Hence my preference for this private briefing.”\\n\\n “If you can’t trust a Spartan, then who can you trust?”\\n\\n “I’m not saying they can’t be trusted. I just don’t want to put that loyalty to the test if we find Halsey, that’s al . I’m not briefing the ODSTs about it, either. Just so that we don’t have any slipups. We stick with our story. Halsey died a long way from Onyx, al suitably sacrificial and heroic. But that’s for the UNSC’s benefit, not hers.”\\n\\n “You could have made her vanish a long time ago, ma’am,” Osman said. “There has to come a point where the irritant factor outweighs her usefulness.”\\n\\n “She’s reached it now she’s compromised our ability to fight.” Parangosky turned her head slowly and glanced at the virtual window. The image it projected from above ground was a bright, sunny summer day. She looked almost wistful, as if she wanted to be outside for a change. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-glasslands-halo-8/page-5.html","bookId":1639,"book":{"id":1639,"title":"Halo: Glasslands (Halo #8)","description":"Storyline: Halo: Glasslands (Halo #8) \\n The Covenant has collapsed after a long, brutal war that saw billions slaughtered on Earth and her colonies.
