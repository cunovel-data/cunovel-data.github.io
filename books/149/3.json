\n [bbe] And I said, Give ear, now, you heads of Jacob and rulers of the people of Israel: is it not for you to have knowledge of what is right? \n 3:2 [hgb] 你 们 恶 善 好 恶 。 从 人 身 上 剥 皮 ， 从 人 骨 头 上 剔 肉 。 \n [kjv] Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones; \n [bbe] You who are haters of good and lovers of evil, pulling off their skin from them and their flesh from their bones; \n 3:3 [hgb] 吃 我 民 的 肉 ， 剥 他 们 的 皮 ， 打 折 他 们 的 骨 头 ， 分 成 块 子 像 要 下 锅 ， 又 像 釜 中 的 肉 。 \n [kjv] Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron. \n [bbe] Like meat they take the flesh of my people for their food, skinning them and crushing their bones, yes, cutting them up as if for the pot, like flesh inside the cooking-pot. \n 3:4 [hgb] 到 了 遭 灾 的 时 候 ， 这 些 人 必 哀 求 耶 和 华 ， 他 却 不 应 允 他 们 。 那 时 他 必 照 他 们 所 行 的 恶 事 ， 向 他 们 掩 面 。 \n [kjv] Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings. \n [bbe] Then they will be crying to the Lord for help, but he will not give them an answer: yes, he will keep his face veiled from them at that time, because their acts have been evil. \n 3:5 [hgb] 论 到 使 我 民 走 差 路 的 先 知 ， 他 们 牙 齿 有 所 嚼 的 ， 他 们 就 呼 喊 说 ， 平 安 了 。 凡 不 供 给 他 们 吃 的 ， 他 们 就 预 备 攻 击 他 （ 预 备 攻 击 他 或 作 说 必 遭 遇 刀 兵 ） 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， \n [kjv] Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him. \n [bbe] This is what the Lord has said about the prophets by whom my people have been turned from the right way; who, biting with their teeth, say, Peace; and if anyone puts nothing in their mouths they make ready for war against him. \n 3:6 [hgb] 你 们 必 遭 遇 黑 夜 ， 以 致 不 见 异 象 。 又 必 遭 遇 幽 暗 ， 以 致 不 能 占 卜 。 日 头 必 向 你 们 沉 落 ， 白 昼 变 为 黑 暗 。 \n [kjv] Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them. \n [bbe] For this cause it will be night for you, without a vision; and it will be dark for you, without knowledge of the future; the sun will go down over the prophets, and the day will be black over them. \n 3:7 [hgb] 先 见 必 抱 愧 ， 占 卜 的 必 蒙 羞 ， 都 必 捂 着 嘴 唇 ， 因 为 神 不 应 允 他 们 。 \n [kjv] Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God. \n [bbe] And the seers will be shamed, and the readers of the future will be at a loss, all of them covering their lips; for there is no answer from God. \n 3:8 [hgb] 至 于 我 ， 我 借 耶 和 华 的 灵 ， 满 有 力 量 公 平 才 能 ， 可 以 向 雅 各 说 明 他 的 过 犯 ， 向 以 色 列 指 出 他 的 罪 恶 。 \n [kjv] But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin. \n [bbe] But I truly am full of the spirit of the Lord, with power of judging and with strength to make clear to Jacob his wrongdoing and to Israel his sin. \n 3:9 [hgb] 雅 各 家 的 首 领 ， 以 色 列 家 的 官 长 阿 ， 当 听 我 的 话 。 你 们 厌 恶 公 平 ， 在 一 切 事 上 屈 枉 正 直 。 \n [kjv] Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity. \n [bbe] Then give ear to this, you heads of the children of Jacob, you rulers of the children of Israel, hating what is right, twisting what is straight. \n 3:10 [hgb] 以 人 血 建 立 锡 安 ， 以 罪 孽 建 造 耶 路 撒 冷 。 \n [kjv] They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity. \n [bbe] They are building up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with evil-doing. \n 3:11 [hgb] 首 领 为 贿 赂 行 审 判 ， 祭 司 为 雇 价 施 训 诲 ， 先 知 为 银 钱 行 占 卜 。 他 们 却 倚 赖 耶 和 华 ， 说 ， 耶 和 华 不 是 在 我 们 中 间 吗 ？ 灾 祸 必 不 临 到 我 们 。 \n [kjv] The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say, Is not the LORD among us? none evil can come upon us. \n [bbe] Its heads take rewards for judging, and the priests take payment for teaching, and the prophets get silver for reading the future: but still, supporting themselves on the Lord, they say, Is not the Lord among us? no evil will overtake us. \n 3:12 [hgb] 所 以 因 你 们 的 缘 故 ， 锡 安 必 被 耕 种 像 一 块 田 ， 耶 路 撒 冷 必 变 为 乱 堆 ， 这 殿 的 山 必 像 丛 林 的 高 处 。 \n [kjv] Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest. \n [bbe] For this reason, Zion will be ploughed like a field because of you, and Jerusalem will become a mass of broken walls, and the mountain of the house like a high place in the woods. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/143/2062.html","bookId":149,"book":{"id":149,"title":"弥迦书 Micah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 当 犹 大 王 约 坦 ， 亚 哈 斯 ， 希 西 家 在 位 的 时 候 ， 摩 利 沙 人 弥 迦 得 耶 和 华 的 默 示 ， 论 撒 玛 利 亚 和 耶 路 撒 冷 。 [kjv] The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/143","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:37 AM"}}
