{"id":4456,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"8:1 [hgb] 第 六 年 六 月 初 五 日 ， 我 坐 在 家 中 。 犹 大 的 众 长 老 坐 在 我 面 前 。 在 那 里 主 耶 和 华 的 灵 （ 原 文 作 手 ） 降 在 我 身 上 。 [kjv] And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in mine house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me. [bbe] Now in the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, when I was in my house and the responsible men of Judah were seated before me, the hand of the Lord came on me there. 8:2 [hgb] 我 观 看 ， 见 有 形 像 仿 佛 火 的 形 状 ， 从 他 腰 以 下 的 形 状 有 火 ， 从 他 腰 以 上 有 光 辉 的 形 状 ， 仿 佛 光 耀 的 精 金 。 [kjv] Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber. [bbe] And looking, I saw a form like fire; from the middle of his body and down there was fire: and up from the middle of his body a sort of shining, like electrum. 8:3 [hgb] 他 伸 出 仿 佛 一 只 手 的 样 式 ， 抓 住 我 的 一 绺 头 发 ， 灵 就 将 我 举 到 天 地 中 间 ， 在 神 的 异 象 中 ， 带 我 到 耶 路 撒 冷 朝 北 的 内 院 门 口 ， 在 那 里 有 触 动 主 怒 偶 像 的 坐 位 ， 就 是 惹 动 忌 邪 的 。 [kjv] And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy. [bbe] And he put out the form of a hand and took me by the hair of my head; and the wind, lifting me up between the earth and the heaven, took me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the way into the inner door facing to the north; where was the seat of the image of envy. 8:4 [hgb] 谁 知 ， 在 那 里 有 以 色 列 神 的 荣 耀 ， 形 状 与 我 在 平 原 所 见 的 一 样 。 [kjv] And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain. [bbe] And I saw the glory of the Lord there, as in the vision which I saw in the valley. 8:5 [hgb] 神 对 我 说 ， 人 子 阿 ， 你 举 目 向 北 观 看 。 我 就 举 目 向 北 观 看 ， 见 祭 坛 门 的 北 边 在 门 口 有 这 惹 忌 邪 的 偶 像 。 [kjv] Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry. [bbe] Then he said to me, Son of man, now let your eyes be lifted up in the direction of the north; and on looking in the direction of the north, to the north of the doorway of the altar, I saw this image of envy by the way in. 8:6 [hgb] 又 对 我 说 ， 人 子 阿 ， 以 色 列 家 所 行 的 ， 就 是 在 此 行 这 大 可 憎 的 事 ， 使 我 远 离 我 的 圣 所 ， 你 看 见 了 吗 ？ 你 还 要 看 见 另 有 大 可 憎 的 事 。 [kjv] He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations. [bbe] And he said to me, Son of man, do you see what they are doing? even the very disgusting things which the children of Israel are doing here, causing me to go far away from my holy place? but you will see other most disgusting things. 8:7 [hgb] 他 领 我 到 院 门 口 。 我 观 看 ， 见 墙 上 有 个 窟 窿 。 [kjv] And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall. [bbe] And he took me to the door of the open place; and looking, I saw a hole in the wall. 8:8 [hgb] 他 对 我 说 ， 人 子 阿 ， 你 要 挖 墙 。 我 一 挖 墙 ， 见 有 一 门 。 [kjv] Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door. [bbe] And he said to me, Son of man, make a hole in the wall: and after making a hole in the wall I saw a door. 8:9 [hgb] 他 说 ， 你 进 去 ， 看 他 们 在 这 里 所 行 可 憎 的 恶 事 。 [kjv] And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here. [bbe] And he said to me, Go in and see the evil and disgusting things which they are doing here. 8:10 [hgb] 我 进 去 一 看 ， 谁 知 ， 在 四 面 墙 上 画 着 各 样 爬 物 和 可 憎 的 走 兽 ， 并 以 色 列 家 一 切 的 偶 像 。 [kjv] So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, pourtrayed upon the wall round about. [bbe] So I went in and saw; and there every sort of living thing which goes flat on the earth, and unclean beasts, and all the images of the children of Israel, were pictured round about on the wall. 8:11 [hgb] 在 这 些 像 前 有 以 色 列 家 的 七 十 个 长 老 站 立 ， 沙 番 的 儿 子 雅 撒 尼 亚 也 站 在 其 中 。 各 人 手 拿 香 炉 ， 烟 云 的 香 气 上 腾 。 [kjv] And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up. [bbe] And before them seventy of the responsible men of the children of Israel had taken their places, every man with a vessel for burning perfumes in his hand, and in the middle of them was Jaazaniah, the son of Shaphan; and a cloud of smoke went up from the burning perfume. 8:12 [hgb] 他 对 我 说 ， 人 子 阿 ， 以 色 列 家 的 长 老 暗 中 在 各 人 画 像 屋 里 所 行 的 ， 你 看 见 了 吗 ？ 他 们 常 说 ， 耶 和 华 看 不 见 我 们 。 耶 和 华 已 经 离 弃 这 地 。 [kjv] Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, The LORD seeth us not; the LORD hath forsaken the earth. [bbe] And he said to me, Son of man, have you seen what the responsible men of the children of Israel do in the dark, every man in his room of pictured images? for they say, The Lord does not see us; the Lord has gone away from the land. 8:13 [hgb] 他 又 说 ， 你 还 要 看 见 他 们 另 外 行 大 可 憎 的 事 。 [kjv] He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations that they do. [bbe] Then he said to me, You will see even more disgusting things which they do. 8:14 [hgb] 他 领 我 到 耶 和 华 殿 外 院 朝 北 的 门 口 。 谁 知 ， 在 那 里 有 妇 女 坐 着 ， 为 搭 模 斯 哭 泣 。 [kjv] Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD\u0027s house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz. [bbe] Then he took me to the door of the way into the Lord\u0027s house looking to the north; and there women were seated weeping for Tammuz. 8:15 [hgb] 他 对 我 说 ， 人 子 阿 ， 你 看 见 了 吗 ？ 你 还 要 看 见 比 这 更 可 憎 的 事 。 [kjv] Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than these. [bbe] Then he said to me, Have you seen this, O son of man? you will see even more disgusting things than these. 8:16 [hgb] 他 又 领 我 到 耶 和 华 殿 的 内 院 。 谁 知 ， 在 耶 和 华 的 殿 门 口 ， 廊 子 和 祭 坛 中 间 ， 约 有 二 十 五 个 人 背 向 耶 和 华 的 殿 ， 面 向 东 方 拜 日 头 。 [kjv] And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD\u0027s house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east. [bbe] And he took me into the inner square of the Lord\u0027s house, and at the door of the Temple of the Lord, between the covered way and the altar, there were about twenty-five men with their backs turned to the Temple of the Lord and their faces turned to the east; and they were worshipping the sun, turning to the east. 8:17 [hgb] 他 对 我 说 ， 人 子 阿 ， 你 看 见 了 吗 ？ 犹 大 家 在 此 行 这 可 憎 的 事 还 算 为 小 吗 ？ 他 们 在 这 地 遍 行 强 暴 ， 再 三 惹 我 发 怒 ， 他 们 手 拿 枝 条 举 向 鼻 前 。 [kjv] Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose. [bbe] Then he said to me, Have you seen this, O son of man? is it a small thing to the children of Judah that they do the disgusting things which they are doing here? for they have made the land full of violent behaviour, making me angry again and again: and see, they put the branch to my nose. 8:18 [hgb] 因 此 ， 我 也 要 以 忿 怒 行 事 ， 我 眼 必 不 顾 惜 ， 也 不 可 怜 他 们 。 他 们 虽 向 我 耳 中 大 声 呼 求 ， 我 还 是 不 听 。 [kjv] Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them. [bbe] For this reason I will let loose my wrath: my eye will not have mercy, and I will have no pity.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/132/1976.html","bookId":156,"book":{"id":156,"title":"以西结书 Ezekiel","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 当 三 十 年 四 月 初 五 日 ， 以 西 结 （ 原 文 作 我 ） 在 迦 巴 鲁 河 边 被 掳 的 人 中 ， 天 就 开 了 ， 得 见 神 的 异 象 。 [kjv] Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/132","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
