{"id":4452,"no":4,"title":"Chapter 4","content":"4:1 [hgb] 人 子 阿 ， 你 要 拿 一 块 砖 ， 摆 在 你 面 前 ， 将 一 座 耶 路 撒 冷 城 画 在 其 上 ， \n [kjv] Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and pourtray upon it the city, even Jerusalem: \n [bbe] And you, son of man, take a back and put it before you and on it make a picture of a town, even Jerusalem. \n 4:2 [hgb] 又 围 困 这 城 ， 造 台 筑 垒 ， 安 营 攻 击 ， 在 四 围 安 设 撞 锤 攻 城 ， \n [kjv] And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set battering rams against it round about. \n [bbe] And make an attack on it, shutting it in, building strong places against it, and making high an earthwork against it; and put up tents against it, placing engines all round it for smashing down its walls. \n 4:3 [hgb] 又 要 拿 个 铁 鏊 ， 放 在 你 和 城 的 中 间 ， 作 为 铁 墙 。 你 要 对 面 攻 击 这 城 ， 使 城 被 困 。 这 样 ， 好 作 以 色 列 家 的 预 兆 。 \n [kjv] Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel. \n [bbe] And take a flat iron plate, and put it for a wall of iron between you and the town: and let your face be turned to it, and it will be shut in and you will make an attack on it. This will be a sign to the children of Israel. \n 4:4 [hgb] 你 要 向 左 侧 卧 ， 承 当 以 色 列 家 的 罪 孽 。 要 按 你 向 左 侧 卧 的 日 数 ， 担 当 他 们 的 罪 孽 。 \n [kjv] Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity. \n [bbe] Then, stretching yourself out on your left side, take the sin of the children of Israel on yourself: for as long as you are stretched out, so long will the sin of the children of Israel be on you. \n 4:5 [hgb] 因 为 我 已 将 他 们 作 孽 的 年 数 定 为 你 向 左 侧 卧 的 日 数 ， 就 是 三 百 九 十 日 ， 你 要 这 样 担 当 以 色 列 家 的 罪 孽 。 \n [kjv] For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. \n [bbe] For I have had the years of their sin measured for you by a number of days, even three hundred and ninety days: and you will take on yourself the sin of the children of Israel. \n 4:6 [hgb] 再 者 ， 你 满 了 这 些 日 子 ， 还 要 向 右 侧 卧 ， 担 当 犹 大 家 的 罪 孽 。 我 给 你 定 规 侧 卧 四 十 日 ， 一 日 顶 一 年 。 \n [kjv] And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year. \n [bbe] And when these days are ended, turning on your right side, you are to take on yourself the sin of the children of Judah: forty days, a day for a year, I have had it fixed for you. \n 4:7 [hgb] 你 要 露 出 膀 臂 ， 面 向 被 困 的 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 说 预 言 攻 击 这 城 。 \n [kjv] Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm shall be uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it. \n [bbe] And let your face be turned to where Jerusalem is shut in, with your arm uncovered, and be a prophet against it. \n 4:8 [hgb] 我 用 绳 索 捆 绑 你 ， 使 你 不 能 辗 转 ， 直 等 你 满 了 困 城 的 日 子 。 \n [kjv] And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege. \n [bbe] And see, I will put bands on you; and you will be stretched out without turning from one side to the other till the days of your attack are ended. \n 4:9 [hgb] 你 要 取 小 麦 ， 大 麦 ， 豆 子 ， 红 豆 ， 小 米 ， 粗 麦 ， 装 在 一 个 器 皿 中 ， 用 以 为 自 己 作 饼 。 要 按 你 侧 卧 的 三 百 九 十 日 吃 这 饼 。 \n [kjv] Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof, according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof. \n [bbe] And take for yourself wheat and barley and different sorts of grain, and put them in one vessel and make bread for yourself from them; all the days when you are stretched on your side it will be your food. \n 4:10 [hgb] 你 所 吃 的 要 按 分 两 吃 ， 每 日 二 十 舍 客 勒 ， 按 时 而 吃 。 \n [kjv] And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it. \n [bbe] And you are to take your food by weight, twenty shekels a day: you are to take it at regular times. \n 4:11 [hgb] 你 喝 水 也 要 按 制 子 ， 每 日 喝 一 欣 六 分 之 一 ， 按 时 而 喝 。 \n [kjv] Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shalt thou drink. \n [bbe] And you are to take water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: you are to take it at regular times. \n 4:12 [hgb] 你 吃 这 饼 像 吃 大 麦 饼 一 样 ， 要 用 人 粪 在 众 人 眼 前 烧 烤 。 \n [kjv] And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight. \n [bbe] And let your food be barley cakes, cooking it before their eyes with the waste which comes out of a man. \n 4:13 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 以 色 列 人 在 我 所 赶 他 们 到 的 各 国 中 ， 也 必 这 样 吃 不 洁 净 的 食 物 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive them. \n [bbe] And the Lord said, Even so the children of Israel will have unclean bread for their food among the nations where I am driving them. \n 4:14 [hgb] 我 说 ， 哎 。 主 耶 和 华 阿 ， 我 素 来 未 曾 被 玷 污 ， 从 幼 年 到 如 今 没 有 吃 过 自 死 的 ， 或 被 野 兽 撕 裂 的 ， 那 可 憎 的 肉 也 未 曾 入 我 的 口 。 \n [kjv] Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth. \n [bbe] Then I said, Ah, Lord! see, my soul has never been unclean, and I have never taken as my food anything which has come to a natural death or has been broken by beasts, from the time when I was young even till now; no disgusting flesh has ever come into my mouth. \n 4:15 [hgb] 于 是 他 对 我 说 ， 看 哪 ， 我 给 你 牛 粪 代 替 人 粪 ， 你 要 将 你 的 饼 烤 在 其 上 。 \n [kjv] Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow\u0027s dung for man\u0027s dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith. \n [bbe] Then he said to me, See, I have given you cow\u0027s waste in place of man\u0027s waste, and you will make your bread ready on it. \n 4:16 [hgb] 他 又 对 我 说 ， 人 子 阿 ， 我 必 在 耶 路 撒 冷 折 断 他 们 的 杖 ， 就 是 断 绝 他 们 的 粮 。 他 们 吃 饼 要 按 分 两 ， 忧 虑 而 吃 。 喝 水 也 要 按 制 子 ， 惊 惶 而 喝 。 \n [kjv] Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment: \n [bbe] And he said to me, Son of man, see, I will take away from Jerusalem her necessary bread: they will take their bread by weight and with care, measuring out their drinking-water with fear and wonder: \n 4:17 [hgb] 使 他 们 缺 粮 缺 水 ， 彼 此 惊 惶 ， 因 自 己 的 罪 孽 消 灭 。 \n [kjv] That they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with another, and consume away for their iniquity. \n [bbe] So that they may be in need of bread and water and be wondering at one another, wasting away in their sin. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/132/1972.html","bookId":156,"book":{"id":156,"title":"以西结书 Ezekiel","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 当 三 十 年 四 月 初 五 日 ， 以 西 结 （ 原 文 作 我 ） 在 迦 巴 鲁 河 边 被 掳 的 人 中 ， 天 就 开 了 ， 得 见 神 的 异 象 。 [kjv] Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/132","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
