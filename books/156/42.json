{"id":4490,"no":42,"title":"Chapter 42","content":"42:1 [hgb] 他 带 我 出 来 向 北 ， 到 外 院 ， 又 带 我 进 入 圣 屋 。 这 圣 屋 一 排 顺 着 空 地 ， 一 排 与 北 边 铺 石 地 之 屋 相 对 。 \n [kjv] Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was before the building toward the north. \n [bbe] And he took me out into the inner square in the direction of the north: and he took me into the rooms which were opposite the separate place and opposite the building to the north. \n 42:2 [hgb] 这 圣 屋 长 一 百 肘 ， 宽 五 十 肘 ， 有 向 北 的 门 。 \n [kjv] Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits. \n [bbe] On the north side it was a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide, \n 42:3 [hgb] 对 着 内 院 那 二 十 肘 宽 之 空 地 ， 又 对 着 外 院 的 铺 石 地 ， 在 第 三 层 楼 上 有 楼 廊 对 着 楼 廊 。 \n [kjv] Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and over against the pavement which was for the utter court, was gallery against gallery in three stories. \n [bbe] Opposite the space of twenty cubits which was part of the inner square, and opposite the stone floor of the outer square. There were covered ways facing one another on the third floor. \n 42:4 [hgb] 在 圣 屋 前 有 一 条 夹 道 ， 宽 十 肘 ， 长 一 百 肘 。 房 门 都 向 北 。 \n [kjv] And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north. \n [bbe] And in front of the rooms was a walk, ten cubits wide and a hundred cubits long; and their doors were facing north. \n 42:5 [hgb] 圣 屋 因 为 楼 廊 占 去 些 地 方 ， 所 以 上 层 比 中 下 两 层 窄 些 。 \n [kjv] Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building. \n [bbe] And the higher rooms were shorter: for the covered ways took up more space from these than from the lower and middle rooms. \n 42:6 [hgb] 圣 屋 有 三 层 ， 却 无 柱 子 ， 不 像 外 院 的 屋 子 有 柱 子 。 所 以 上 层 比 中 下 两 层 更 窄 。 \n [kjv] For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground. \n [bbe] For they were on three floors, and they had no pillars like the pillars of the outer square; so the highest was narrower than the lowest and middle floors from the earth level. \n 42:7 [hgb] 圣 屋 外 ， 东 边 有 墙 ， 靠 着 外 院 ， 长 五 十 肘 。 \n [kjv] And the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits. \n [bbe] And the wall which went outside by the side of the rooms, in the direction of the outer square in front of the rooms, was fifty cubits long. \n 42:8 [hgb] 靠 着 外 院 的 圣 屋 长 五 十 肘 。 殿 北 面 的 圣 屋 长 一 百 肘 。 \n [kjv] For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were an hundred cubits. \n [bbe] For the rooms in the outer square were fifty cubits long: and in front of the Temple was a space of a hundred cubits. \n 42:9 [hgb] 在 圣 屋 以 下 ， 东 头 有 进 入 之 处 ， 就 是 从 外 院 进 入 之 处 。 \n [kjv] And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the utter court. \n [bbe] And under these rooms was the way in from the east side, as one goes into them from the outer square at the head of the outer wall. \n 42:10 [hgb] 向 南 （ 原 文 作 东 ） 在 内 院 墙 里 有 圣 屋 ， 一 排 与 铺 石 地 之 屋 相 对 ， 一 排 顺 着 空 地 。 \n [kjv] The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building. \n [bbe] (And he took me) to the south, and in front of the separate place and in front of the building there were rooms. \n 42:11 [hgb] 这 圣 屋 前 的 夹 道 与 北 边 圣 屋 的 夹 道 长 宽 一 样 。 出 入 之 处 与 北 屋 门 的 样 式 相 同 。 \n [kjv] And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north, as long as they, and as broad as they: and all their goings out were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors. \n [bbe] And there was a walk in front of them like that by the rooms on the north; they were equally long and wide; and the ways out of them were the same in design and had the same sort of doors. \n 42:12 [hgb] 正 在 墙 前 ， 夹 道 的 东 头 ， 有 门 可 以 进 入 ， 与 向 南 圣 屋 的 门 一 样 。 \n [kjv] And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them. \n [bbe] And under the rooms on the south was a door at the head of the outer wall in the direction of the east as one goes in. \n 42:13 [hgb] 他 对 我 说 ， 顺 着 空 地 的 南 屋 北 屋 ， 都 是 圣 屋 。 亲 近 耶 和 华 的 祭 司 当 在 那 里 吃 至 圣 的 物 ， 也 当 在 那 里 放 至 圣 的 物 ， 就 是 素 祭 ， 赎 罪 祭 ， 和 赎 愆 祭 ， 因 此 处 为 圣 。 \n [kjv] Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy. \n [bbe] And he said to me, The north rooms and the south rooms in front of the separate place are the holy rooms, where the priests who come near the Lord take the most holy things for their food: there the most holy things are placed, with the meal offering and the sin-offering and the offering for error; for the place is holy. \n 42:14 [hgb] 祭 司 进 去 出 了 圣 所 的 时 候 ， 不 可 直 到 外 院 ， 但 要 在 圣 屋 放 下 他 们 供 职 的 衣 服 ， 因 为 是 圣 衣 。 要 穿 上 别 的 衣 服 才 可 以 到 属 民 的 外 院 。 \n [kjv] When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to those things which are for the people. \n [bbe] When the priests go in, they may not go out of the holy place into the outer square, and there they are to put the robes in which they do the work of the Lord\u0027s house, for they are holy: and they have to put on other clothing before they come near that which has to do with the people. \n 42:15 [hgb] 他 量 完 了 内 殿 ， 就 带 我 出 朝 东 的 门 ， 量 院 的 四 围 。 \n [kjv] Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about. \n [bbe] And when he had come to the end of measuring the inner house, he took me out to the doorway looking to the east, and took its measure all round. \n 42:16 [hgb] 他 用 量 度 的 竿 量 四 围 ， 量 东 面 五 百 肘 （ 原 文 作 竿 本 章 下 同 ） ， \n [kjv] He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. \n [bbe] He went round and took the measure of it on the east side with the measuring rod, five hundred, measured with the rod all round. \n 42:17 [hgb] 用 竿 量 北 面 五 百 肘 ， \n [kjv] He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. \n [bbe] And he went round and took the measure of it on the north side with the measuring rod, five hundred, measured with the rod all round. \n 42:18 [hgb] 用 竿 量 南 面 五 百 肘 ， \n [kjv] He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed. \n [bbe] And he went round and took the measure of it on the south side with the measuring rod, five hundred, measured with the rod all round. \n 42:19 [hgb] 又 转 到 西 面 ， 用 竿 量 五 百 肘 。 \n [kjv] He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. \n [bbe] And he went round and took the measure of it on the west side with the measuring rod, five hundred, measured with the rod all round. \n 42:20 [hgb] 他 量 四 面 ， 四 围 有 墙 ， 长 五 百 肘 ， 宽 五 百 肘 ， 为 要 分 别 圣 地 与 俗 地 。 \n [kjv] He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place. \n [bbe] He took its measure on the four sides: and it had a wall all round, five hundred long and five hundred wide, separating what was holy from what was common. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/132/2010.html","bookId":156,"book":{"id":156,"title":"以西结书 Ezekiel","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 当 三 十 年 四 月 初 五 日 ， 以 西 结 （ 原 文 作 我 ） 在 迦 巴 鲁 河 边 被 掳 的 人 中 ， 天 就 开 了 ， 得 见 神 的 异 象 。 [kjv] Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/132","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
