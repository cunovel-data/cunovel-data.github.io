Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness. \n [bbe] And he said to me, Son of man, let your stomach make a meal of it and let your inside be full of this roll which I am giving you. Then I took it, and it was sweet as honey in my mouth. \n 3:4 [hgb] 他 对 我 说 ， 人 子 阿 ， 你 往 以 色 列 家 那 里 去 ， 将 我 的 话 对 他 们 讲 说 。 \n [kjv] And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them. \n [bbe] And he said to me, Son of man, go now to the children of Israel, and say my words to them. \n 3:5 [hgb] 你 奉 差 遣 不 是 往 那 说 话 深 奥 ， 言 语 难 懂 的 民 那 里 去 ， 乃 是 往 以 色 列 家 去 。 \n [kjv] For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel; \n [bbe] For you are not sent to a people whose talk is strange and whose language is hard, but to the children of Israel; \n 3:6 [hgb] 不 是 往 那 说 话 深 奥 ， 言 语 难 懂 的 多 国 去 ， 他 们 的 话 语 是 你 不 懂 得 的 。 我 若 差 你 往 他 们 那 里 去 ， 他 们 必 听 从 你 。 \n [kjv] Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee. \n [bbe] Not to a number of peoples whose talk is strange and whose language is hard and whose words are not clear to you. Truly, if I sent you to them they would give ear to you. \n 3:7 [hgb] 以 色 列 家 却 不 肯 听 从 你 ， 因 为 他 们 不 肯 听 从 我 。 原 来 以 色 列 全 家 是 额 坚 心 硬 的 人 。 \n [kjv] But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted. \n [bbe] But the children of Israel will not give ear to you; for they have no mind to give ear to me: for all the children of Israel have a hard brow and a stiff heart. \n 3:8 [hgb] 看 哪 ， 我 使 你 的 脸 硬 过 他 们 的 脸 ， 使 你 的 额 硬 过 他 们 的 额 。 \n [kjv] Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads. \n [bbe] See, I have made your face hard against their faces, and your brow hard against their brows. \n 3:9 [hgb] 我 使 你 的 额 像 金 钢 钻 ， 比 火 石 更 硬 。 他 们 虽 是 悖 逆 之 家 ， 你 不 要 怕 他 们 ， 也 不 要 因 他 们 的 脸 色 惊 惶 。 \n [kjv] As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house. \n [bbe] Like a diamond harder than rock I have made your brow: have no fear of them and do not be overcome by their looks, for they are an uncontrolled people. \n 3:10 [hgb] 他 又 对 我 说 ， 人 子 阿 ， 我 对 你 所 说 的 一 切 话 ， 要 心 里 领 会 ， 耳 中 听 闻 。 \n [kjv] Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears. \n [bbe] Then he said to me, Son of man, take into your heart all my words which I am about to say to you, and let your ears be open to them. \n 3:11 [hgb] 你 往 你 本 国 被 掳 的 子 民 那 里 去 ， 他 们 或 听 ， 或 不 听 ， 你 要 对 他 们 讲 说 ， 告 诉 他 们 这 是 主 耶 和 华 说 的 。 \n [kjv] And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear. \n [bbe] And go now to those who have been taken away as prisoners, to the children of your people, and say to them, This is what the Lord has said; if they give ear or if they do not. \n 3:12 [hgb] 那 时 ， 灵 将 我 举 起 ， 我 就 听 见 在 我 身 后 有 震 动 轰 轰 的 声 音 ， 说 ， 从 耶 和 华 的 所 在 显 出 来 的 荣 耀 是 该 称 颂 的 。 \n [kjv] Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place. \n [bbe] Then I was lifted up by the wind, and at my back the sound of a great rushing came to my ears when the glory of the Lord was lifted up from his place. \n 3:13 [hgb] 我 又 听 见 那 活 物 翅 膀 相 碰 ， 与 活 物 旁 边 轮 子 旋 转 震 动 轰 轰 的 响 声 。 \n [kjv] I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing. \n [bbe] And there was the sound of the wings of the living beings touching one another, and the sound of the wheels at their side, the sound of a great rushing. \n 3:14 [hgb] 于 是 灵 将 我 举 起 ， 带 我 而 去 。 我 心 中 甚 苦 ， 灵 性 忿 激 ， 并 且 耶 和 华 的 灵 （ 原 文 作 手 ） 在 我 身 上 大 有 能 力 。 \n [kjv] So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me. \n [bbe] And the wind, lifting me up, took me away: and I went in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of the Lord was strong on me. \n 3:15 [hgb] 我 就 来 到 提 勒 亚 毕 ， 住 在 迦 巴 鲁 河 边 被 掳 的 人 那 里 ， 到 他 们 所 住 的 地 方 ， 在 他 们 中 间 忧 忧 闷 闷 地 坐 了 七 日 。 \n [kjv] Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days. \n [bbe] Then I came to those who had been taken away as prisoners, who were at Telabib by the river Chebar, and I was seated among them full of wonder for seven days. \n 3:16 [hgb] 过 了 七 日 ， 耶 和 华 的 话 临 到 我 说 ， \n [kjv] And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, \n [bbe] And at the end of seven days, the word of the Lord came to me, saying, \n 3:17 [hgb] 人 子 阿 ， 我 立 你 作 以 色 列 家 守 望 的 人 ， 所 以 你 要 听 我 口 中 的 话 ， 替 我 警 戒 他 们 。 \n [kjv] Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me. \n [bbe] Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the children of Israel: so give ear to the word of my mouth, and give them word from me of their danger. \n 3:18 [hgb] 我 何 时 指 着 恶 人 说 ， 他 必 要 死 。 你 若 不 警 戒 他 ， 也 不 劝 戒 他 ， 使 他 离 开 恶 行 ， 拯 救 他 的 性 命 ， 这 恶 人 必 死 在 罪 孽 之 中 。 我 却 要 向 你 讨 他 丧 命 的 罪 （ 原 文 作 血 ） 。 \n [kjv] When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. \n [bbe] When I say to the evil-doer, Death will certainly be your fate; and you give him no word of it and say nothing to make clear to the evil-doer the danger of his evil way, so that he may be safe; that same evil man will come to death in his evil-doing; but I will make you responsible for his blood. \n 3:19 [hgb] 倘 若 你 警 戒 恶 人 ， 他 仍 不 转 离 罪 恶 ， 也 不 离 开 恶 行 ， 他 必 死 在 罪 孽 之 中 ， 你 却 救 自 己 脱 离 了 罪 。 \n [kjv] Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. \n [bbe] But if you give the evil-doer word of his danger, and he is not turned from his sin or from his evil way, death will overtake him in his evil-doing; but your life will be safe. \n 3:20 [hgb] 再 者 ， 义 人 何 时 离 义 而 犯 罪 ， 我 将 绊 脚 石 放 在 他 面 前 ， 他 就 必 死 。 因 你 没 有 警 戒 他 ， 他 必 死 在 罪 中 ， 他 素 来 所 行 的 义 不 被 记 念 。 我 却 要 向 你 讨 他 丧 命 的 罪 （ 原 文 作 血 ） 。 \n [kjv] Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand. \n [bbe] Again, when an upright man, turning away from his righteousness, does evil, and I put a cause of falling in his way, death will overtake him: because you have given him no word of his danger, death will overtake him in his evil-doing, and there will be no memory of the upright acts which he has done; but I will make you responsible for his blood. \n 3:21 [hgb] 倘 若 你 警 戒 义 人 ， 使 他 不 犯 罪 ， 他 就 不 犯 罪 。 他 因 受 警 戒 就 必 存 活 ， 你 也 救 自 己 脱 离 了 罪 。 \n [kjv] Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul. \n [bbe] But if you say to the upright man that he is not to do evil, he will certainly keep his life because he took note of your word; and your life will be safe. \n 3:22 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 灵 （ 原 文 作 手 ） 在 那 里 降 在 我 身 上 。 他 对 我 说 ， 你 起 来 往 平 原 去 ， 我 要 在 那 里 和 你 说 话 。 \n [kjv] And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee. \n [bbe] And the hand of the Lord was on me there; and he said, Get up and go out into the valley and there I will have talk with you. \n 3:23 [hgb] 于 是 我 起 来 往 平 原 去 ， 不 料 ， 耶 和 华 的 荣 耀 正 如 我 在 迦 巴 鲁 河 边 所 见 的 一 样 ， 停 在 那 里 ， 我 就 俯 伏 于 地 。 \n [kjv] Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face. \n [bbe] Then I got up and went out into the valley; and I saw the glory of the Lord resting there as I had seen it by the river Chebar; and I went down on my face. \n 3:24 [hgb] 灵 就 进 入 我 里 面 ， 使 我 站 起 来 。 耶 和 华 对 我 说 ， 你 进 房 屋 去 ， 将 门 关 上 。 \n [kjv] Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house. \n [bbe] Then the spirit came into me and put me on my feet; and he had talk with me and said to me, Go and keep yourself shut up inside your house. \n 3:25 [hgb] 人 子 阿 ， 人 必 用 绳 索 捆 绑 你 ， 你 就 不 能 出 去 在 他 们 中 间 来 往 。 \n [kjv] But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them: \n [bbe] But see, O son of man, I will put bands on you, prisoning you in them, and you will not go out among them: \n 3:26 [hgb] 我 必 使 你 的 舌 头 贴 住 上 膛 ， 以 致 你 哑 口 ， 不 能 作 责 备 他 们 的 人 。 他 们 原 是 悖 逆 之 家 。 \n [kjv] And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house. \n [bbe] And I will make your tongue fixed to the roof of your mouth, so that you have no voice and may not make protests to them: for they are an uncontrolled people. \n 3:27 [hgb] 但 我 对 你 说 话 的 时 候 ， 必 使 你 开 口 ， 你 就 要 对 他 们 说 ， 主 耶 和 华 如 此 说 。 听 的 可 以 听 ， 不 听 的 任 他 不 听 ， 因 为 他 们 是 悖 逆 之 家 。 \n [kjv] But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house. \n [bbe] But when I have talk with you I will make your mouth open, and you are to say to them, This is what the Lord has said: Let the hearer give ear; and as for him who will not, let him keep his ears shut: for they are an uncontrolled people. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/132/1971.html","bookId":156,"book":{"id":156,"title":"以西结书 Ezekiel","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 当 三 十 年 四 月 初 五 日 ， 以 西 结 （ 原 文 作 我 ） 在 迦 巴 鲁 河 边 被 掳 的 人 中 ， 天 就 开 了 ， 得 见 神 的 异 象 。 [kjv] Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/132","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
