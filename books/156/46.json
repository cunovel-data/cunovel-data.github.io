but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened. \n [bbe] This is what the Lord has said: The doorway of the inner square looking to the east is to be shut on the six working days; but on the Sabbath it is to be open, and at the time of the new moon it is to be open. \n 46:2 [hgb] 王 要 从 这 门 的 廊 进 入 ， 站 在 门 框 旁 边 。 祭 司 要 为 他 预 备 燔 祭 和 平 安 祭 ， 他 就 要 在 门 槛 那 里 敬 拜 ， 然 后 出 去 。 这 门 直 到 晚 上 不 可 关 闭 。 \n [kjv] And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening. \n [bbe] And the ruler is to go in through the covered way of the outer doorway outside, and take his place by the pillar of the doorway, and the priests will make his burned offering and his peace-offerings and he will give worship at the doorstep of the doorway; then he will go out, and the door will not be shut till the evening. \n 46:3 [hgb] 在 安 息 日 和 月 朔 ， 国 内 的 居 民 要 在 这 门 口 ， 耶 和 华 面 前 敬 拜 。 \n [kjv] Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons. \n [bbe] And the people of the land are to give worship at the door of that doorway before the Lord on the Sabbaths and at the new moons. \n 46:4 [hgb] 安 息 日 ， 王 所 献 与 耶 和 华 的 燔 祭 要 用 无 残 疾 的 羊 羔 六 只 ， 无 残 疾 的 公 绵 羊 一 只 。 \n [kjv] And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the LORD in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish. \n [bbe] And the burned offering offered to the Lord by the ruler on the Sabbath day is to be six lambs without a mark on them and a male sheep without a mark; \n 46:5 [hgb] 同 献 的 素 祭 要 为 公 绵 羊 献 一 伊 法 细 面 ， 为 羊 羔 照 他 的 力 量 而 献 ， 一 伊 法 细 面 加 油 一 欣 。 \n [kjv] And the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram, and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah. \n [bbe] And the meal offering is to be an ephah for the sheep, and for the lambs whatever he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah. \n 46:6 [hgb] 当 月 朔 ， 要 献 无 残 疾 的 公 牛 犊 一 只 ， 羊 羔 六 只 ， 公 绵 羊 一 只 ， 都 要 无 残 疾 的 。 \n [kjv] And in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without blemish. \n [bbe] And at the time of the new moon it is to be a young ox of the herd without a mark on him, and six lambs and a male sheep, all without a mark: \n 46:7 [hgb] 他 也 要 预 备 素 祭 ， 为 公 牛 献 一 伊 法 细 面 ， 为 公 绵 羊 献 一 伊 法 细 面 ， 为 羊 羔 照 他 的 力 量 而 献 ， 一 伊 法 细 面 加 油 一 欣 。 \n [kjv] And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto, and an hin of oil to an ephah. \n [bbe] And he is to give a meal offering, an ephah for the ox and an ephah for the sheep, and for the lambs whatever he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah. \n 46:8 [hgb] 王 进 入 的 时 候 必 由 这 门 的 廊 而 入 ， 也 必 由 此 而 出 。 \n [kjv] And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof. \n [bbe] And when the ruler comes in, he is to go in through the covered way of the doorway, and he is to go out by the same way. \n 46:9 [hgb] 在 各 节 期 ， 国 内 居 民 朝 见 耶 和 华 的 时 候 ， 从 北 门 进 入 敬 拜 的 ， 必 由 南 门 而 出 。 从 南 门 进 入 的 ， 必 由 北 门 而 出 。 不 可 从 所 入 的 门 而 出 ， 必 要 直 往 前 行 ， 由 对 门 而 出 。 \n [kjv] But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in the solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth over against it. \n [bbe] But when the people of the land come before the Lord at the fixed feasts, he who comes in by the north doorway to give worship is to go out by the south doorway; and he who comes in by the south doorway is to go out by the north doorway: he is not to come back by the doorway through which he went in, but is to go straight before him. \n 46:10 [hgb] 民 进 入 ， 王 也 要 在 民 中 进 入 。 民 出 去 ， 王 也 要 一 同 出 去 。 \n [kjv] And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth. \n [bbe] And the ruler, when they come in, is to come among them, and is to go out when they go out. \n 46:11 [hgb] 在 节 期 和 圣 会 的 日 子 同 献 的 素 祭 ， 要 为 一 只 公 牛 献 一 伊 法 细 面 ， 为 一 只 公 绵 羊 献 一 伊 法 细 面 ， 为 羊 羔 照 他 的 力 量 而 献 ， 一 伊 法 细 面 加 油 一 欣 。 \n [kjv] And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah. \n [bbe] At the feasts and the fixed meetings the meal offerings are to be an ephah for an ox, and an ephah for a male sheep, and for the lambs whatever he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah. \n 46:12 [hgb] 王 预 备 甘 心 献 的 燔 祭 或 平 安 祭 ， 就 是 向 耶 和 华 甘 心 献 的 ， 当 有 人 为 他 开 朝 东 的 门 。 他 就 预 备 燔 祭 和 平 安 祭 ， 与 安 息 日 预 备 的 一 样 ， 献 毕 就 出 去 。 他 出 去 之 后 ， 当 有 人 将 门 关 闭 。 \n [kjv] Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the LORD, one shall then open him the gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate. \n [bbe] And when the ruler makes a free offering, a burned offering or a peace-offering freely given to the Lord, the doorway looking to the east is to be made open for him, and he is to make his burned offering and his peace-offerings as he does on the Sabbath day: and he will go out; and the door will be shut after he has gone out. \n 46:13 [hgb] 每 日 ， 你 要 预 备 无 残 疾 一 岁 的 羊 羔 一 只 ， 献 与 耶 和 华 为 燔 祭 。 要 每 早 晨 预 备 。 \n [kjv] Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the LORD of a lamb of the first year without blemish: thou shalt prepare it every morning. \n [bbe] And you are to give a lamb a year old without any mark on it for a burned offering to the Lord every day: morning by morning you are to give it. \n 46:14 [hgb] 每 早 晨 也 要 预 备 同 献 的 素 祭 ， 细 面 一 伊 法 六 分 之 一 ， 并 油 一 欣 三 分 之 一 ， 调 和 细 面 。 这 素 祭 要 常 献 与 耶 和 华 为 永 远 的 定 例 。 \n [kjv] And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the LORD. \n [bbe] And you are to give, morning by morning, a meal offering with it, a sixth of an ephah and a third of a hin of oil dropped on the best meal; a meal offering offered to the Lord at all times by an eternal order. \n 46:15 [hgb] 每 早 晨 要 这 样 预 备 羊 羔 ， 素 祭 ， 并 油 为 常 献 的 燔 祭 。 \n [kjv] Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the oil, every morning for a continual burnt offering. \n [bbe] And they are to give the lamb and the meal offering and the oil, morning by morning, for a burned offering at all times. \n 46:16 [hgb] 主 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 王 若 将 产 业 赐 给 他 的 儿 子 ， 就 成 了 他 儿 子 的 产 业 ， 那 是 他 们 承 受 为 业 的 。 \n [kjv] Thus saith the Lord GOD; If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons\u0027; it shall be their possession by inheritance. \n [bbe] This is what the Lord has said: If the ruler gives a property to any of his sons, it is his heritage and will be the property of his sons; it is theirs for their heritage. \n 46:17 [hgb] 倘 若 王 将 一 分 产 业 赐 给 他 的 臣 仆 ， 就 成 了 他 臣 仆 的 产 业 。 到 自 由 之 年 仍 要 归 与 王 。 至 于 王 的 产 业 ， 必 归 与 他 的 儿 子 。 \n [kjv] But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be his sons\u0027 for them. \n [bbe] And if he gives a part of his heritage to one of his servants, it will be his till the year of making free, and then it will go back to the ruler; for it is his sons\u0027 heritage, and is to be theirs. \n 46:18 [hgb] 王 不 可 夺 取 民 的 产 业 ， 以 致 驱 逐 他 们 离 开 所 承 受 的 。 他 要 从 自 己 的 地 业 中 ， 将 产 业 赐 给 他 儿 子 ， 免 得 我 的 民 分 散 ， 各 人 离 开 所 承 受 的 。 \n [kjv] Moreover the prince shall not take of the people\u0027s inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; but he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession: that my people be not scattered every man from his possession. \n [bbe] And the ruler is not to take the heritage of any of the people, driving them out of their property; he is to give a heritage to his sons out of the property which is his: so that my people may not be sent away from their property. \n 46:19 [hgb] 那 带 我 的 ， 将 我 从 门 旁 进 入 之 处 ， 领 进 为 祭 司 预 备 的 圣 屋 ， 是 朝 北 的 ， 见 后 头 西 边 有 一 块 地 。 \n [kjv] After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the two sides westward. \n [bbe] And he took me through by the way in at the side of the doorway into the holy rooms which are the priests\u0027, looking to the north: and I saw a place at the side of them to the west. \n 46:20 [hgb] 他 对 我 说 ， 这 是 祭 司 煮 赎 愆 祭 ， 赎 罪 祭 ， 烤 素 祭 之 地 ， 免 得 带 到 外 院 ， 使 民 成 圣 。 \n [kjv] Then said he unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear them not out into the utter court, to sanctify the people. \n [bbe] And he said to me, This is the place where the offering for error and the sin-offering are to be cooked in water by the priests, and where the meal offering is to be cooked in the oven; so that they may not be taken out into the outer square to make the people holy. \n 46:21 [hgb] 他 又 带 我 到 外 院 ， 使 我 经 过 院 子 的 四 拐 角 ， 见 每 拐 角 各 有 一 个 院 子 。 \n [kjv] Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court. \n [bbe] And he took me out into the outer square and made me go by the four angles of the square; and I saw that in every angle of the open square there was a space shut in. \n 46:22 [hgb] 院 子 四 拐 角 的 院 子 ， 周 围 有 墙 ， 每 院 长 四 十 肘 ， 宽 三 十 肘 。 四 拐 角 院 子 的 尺 寸 都 是 一 样 ， \n [kjv] In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners were of one measure. \n [bbe] In the four angles there were spaces walled in, forty cubits long and thirty wide; the four were of the same size. \n 46:23 [hgb] 其 中 周 围 有 一 排 房 子 ， 房 子 内 有 煮 肉 的 地 方 。 \n [kjv] And there was a row of building round about in them, round about them four, and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about. \n [bbe] And there was a line of wall all round inside them, round all four, and boiling-places were made under it all round about. \n 46:24 [hgb] 他 对 我 说 ， 这 都 是 煮 肉 的 房 子 ， 殿 内 的 仆 役 要 在 这 里 煮 民 的 祭 物 。 \n [kjv] Then said he unto me, These are the places of them that boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people. \n [bbe] And he said to me, These are the boiling-rooms, where the offering of the people is cooked by the servants of the house. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/132/2014.html","bookId":156,"book":{"id":156,"title":"以西结书 Ezekiel","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 当 三 十 年 四 月 初 五 日 ， 以 西 结 （ 原 文 作 我 ） 在 迦 巴 鲁 河 边 被 掳 的 人 中 ， 天 就 开 了 ， 得 见 神 的 异 象 。 [kjv] Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/132","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
