[bbe] And he took me to the Temple, and took the measure of the uprights, six cubits wide on one side and six cubits wide on the other. 41:2 [hgb] 门 口 宽 十 肘 。 门 两 旁 ， 这 边 五 肘 ， 那 边 五 肘 。 他 量 殿 长 四 十 肘 ， 宽 二 十 肘 。 [kjv] And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits. [bbe] And the door-opening was ten cubits wide; and the side walls of the door-opening were five cubits on one side and five cubits on the other: and it was forty cubits long and twenty cubits wide. 41:3 [hgb] 他 到 内 殿 量 墙 柱 ， 各 厚 二 肘 。 门 口 宽 六 肘 ， 门 两 旁 各 宽 七 肘 。 [kjv] Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits. [bbe] And he went inside and took the measure of the uprights of the door-opening, two cubits: and the door-opening, six cubits; and the side-walls of the door-opening were seven cubits on one side and seven cubits on the other. 41:4 [hgb] 他 量 内 殿 ， 长 二 十 肘 ， 宽 二 十 肘 。 他 对 我 说 ， 这 是 至 圣 所 。 [kjv] So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place. [bbe] And by his measure it was twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide in front of the Temple: and he said to me, This is the most holy place. 41:5 [hgb] 他 又 量 殿 墙 ， 厚 六 肘 。 围 着 殿 有 旁 屋 ， 各 宽 四 肘 。 [kjv] After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side. [bbe] Then he took the measure of the wall of the house, which was six cubits; and of the side-rooms round the house, which were four cubits wide. 41:6 [hgb] 旁 屋 有 三 层 ， 层 叠 而 上 ， 每 层 排 列 三 十 间 。 旁 屋 的 梁 木 搁 在 殿 墙 坎 上 ， 免 得 插 入 殿 墙 。 [kjv] And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house. [bbe] And the side-rooms, room over room, were three times thirty; there were inlets in the wall of the house for the side-rooms round about, for supports in the wall of the house. 41:7 [hgb] 这 围 殿 的 旁 屋 越 高 越 宽 。 因 旁 屋 围 殿 悬 叠 而 上 ， 所 以 越 上 越 宽 ， 从 下 一 层 ， 由 中 一 层 ， 到 上 一 层 。 [kjv] And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house was still upward, and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by the midst. [bbe] The side-rooms became wider as they went higher up the house, by the amount of the space let into the wall up round about the house, because of the inlets in the house; and one went up from the lowest floor by steps to the middle, and from the middle to the upper floor. 41:8 [hgb] 我 又 见 围 着 殿 有 高 月 台 。 旁 屋 的 根 基 ， 高 足 一 竿 ， 就 是 六 大 肘 。 [kjv] I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits. [bbe] And I saw that the house had a stone floor all round; the bases of the side-rooms were a full rod of six great cubits high. 41:9 [hgb] 旁 屋 的 外 墙 厚 五 肘 。 旁 屋 之 外 还 有 余 地 。 [kjv] The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber without, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within. [bbe] The wall supporting the side-rooms on the outside was five cubits thick: and there was a free space of five cubits between the side-rooms of the house. 41:10 [hgb] 在 旁 屋 与 对 面 的 房 屋 中 间 有 空 地 ， 宽 二 十 肘 。 [kjv] And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every side. [bbe] And between the rooms was a space twenty cubits wide all round the house. 41:11 [hgb] 旁 屋 的 门 都 向 余 地 ， 一 门 向 北 ， 一 门 向 南 。 周 围 的 余 地 宽 五 肘 。 [kjv] And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about. [bbe] And the free space had doors opening from the side-rooms, one door on the north and one door on the south: and the free space was five cubits wide all round. 41:12 [hgb] 在 西 面 空 地 之 后 有 房 子 ， 宽 七 十 肘 ， 长 九 十 肘 ， 墙 四 围 厚 五 肘 。 [kjv] Now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits. [bbe] And the building which was in front of the separate place at the side to the west was seventy cubits wide; the wall of the building was five cubits thick all round and ninety cubits long. 41:13 [hgb] 这 样 ， 他 量 殿 ， 长 一 百 肘 ， 又 量 空 地 和 那 房 子 并 墙 ， 共 长 一 百 肘 。 [kjv] So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long; [bbe] And he took the measure of the house; it was a hundred cubits long; and the separate place and the building with its walls was a hundred cubits long; 41:14 [hgb] 殿 的 前 面 和 两 旁 的 空 地 ， 宽 一 百 肘 。 [kjv] Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits. [bbe] And the east front of the house and of the separate place was a hundred cubits wide. 41:15 [hgb] 他 量 空 地 后 面 的 那 房 子 ， 并 两 旁 的 楼 廊 ， 共 长 一 百 肘 。 [kjv] And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court; [bbe] And he took the measure of the building in front of the separate place which was at the back of it, and the pillared walks on one side and on the other side; they were a hundred cubits long; and the Temple and the inner part and its outer covered way were covered in; 41:16 [hgb] 内 殿 ， 院 廊 ， 门 槛 ， 严 紧 的 窗 棂 ， 并 对 着 门 槛 的 三 层 楼 廊 ， 从 地 到 窗 棂 （ 窗 棂 都 有 蔽 子 ） ， [kjv] The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the door, cieled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were covered; [bbe] And the sloping windows and the covered ways round all three of them were of shakiph-wood all round from the level of the earth up to the windows; 41:17 [hgb] 直 到 门 以 上 ， 就 是 到 内 殿 和 外 殿 内 外 四 围 墙 壁 ， 都 按 尺 寸 用 木 板 遮 蔽 。 [kjv] To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure. [bbe] And there was a roof over the doorway and as far as the inner house, and to the outside and on the wall all round, inside and outside. 41:18 [hgb] 墙 上 雕 刻 基 路 伯 和 棕 树 。 每 二 基 路 伯 中 间 有 一 棵 棕 树 ， 每 基 路 伯 有 二 脸 。 [kjv] And it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces; [bbe] And it had pictured forms of winged beings and palm-trees; a palm-tree between two winged ones, and every winged one had two faces; 41:19 [hgb] 这 边 有 人 脸 向 着 棕 树 ， 那 边 有 狮 子 脸 向 着 棕 树 ， 殿 内 周 围 都 是 如 此 。 [kjv] So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: it was made through all the house round about. [bbe] So that there was the face of a man turned to the palm-tree on one side, and the face of a young lion on the other side: so it was made all round the house. 41:20 [hgb] 从 地 至 门 以 上 ， 都 有 基 路 伯 和 棕 树 。 殿 墙 就 是 这 样 。 [kjv] From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm trees made, and on the wall of the temple. [bbe] From earth level up to the windows there were winged ones and palm-trees pictured on the wall. 41:21 [hgb] 殿 的 门 柱 是 方 的 。 至 圣 所 的 前 面 ， 形 状 和 殿 的 形 状 一 样 。 [kjv] The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the sanctuary; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other. [bbe] ... 41:22 [hgb] 坛 是 木 头 作 的 ， 高 三 肘 ， 长 二 肘 。 坛 角 和 坛 面 ， 并 四 旁 ， 都 是 木 头 作 的 。 他 对 我 说 ， 这 是 耶 和 华 面 前 的 桌 子 。 [kjv] The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that is before the LORD. [bbe] The altar was made of wood, and was three cubits high and two cubits long; it had angles, and its base and sides were of wood; and he said to me, This is the table which is before the Lord. 41:23 [hgb] 殿 和 至 圣 所 的 门 各 有 两 扇 。 [kjv] And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors. [bbe] The Temple had two doors. 41:24 [hgb] 每 扇 分 两 扇 ， 这 两 扇 是 摺 叠 的 。 这 边 门 分 两 扇 ， 那 边 门 也 分 两 扇 。 [kjv] And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other door. [bbe] And the holy place had two doors, and the doors had two turning leaves, two for one and two for the other. 41:25 [hgb] 殿 的 门 扇 上 雕 刻 基 路 伯 和 棕 树 ， 与 刻 在 墙 上 的 一 般 。 在 外 头 廊 前 有 木 槛 。 [kjv] And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubims and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch without. [bbe] And on them were pictured winged ones and palm-trees, as on the walls; and a ... of wood was on the front of the covered way outside. 41:26 [hgb] 廊 这 边 那 边 都 有 严 紧 的 窗 棂 和 棕 树 。 殿 的 旁 屋 和 槛 就 是 这 样 。 [kjv] And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the side chambers of the house, and thick planks.
