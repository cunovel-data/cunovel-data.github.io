[bbe] Son of man, what is the vine-tree more than any branching tree which is among the trees of the woods? 15:3 [hgb] 其 上 可 以 取 木 料 作 什 么 工 用 ， 可 以 取 来 作 钉 子 挂 什 么 器 皿 吗 ？ [kjv] Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon? [bbe] Will its wood be used for any work? do men make of it a pin for hanging any vessel on? 15:4 [hgb] 看 哪 ， 已 经 抛 在 火 中 当 作 柴 烧 ， 火 既 烧 了 两 头 ， 中 间 也 被 烧 了 ， 还 有 益 于 工 用 吗 ？ [kjv] Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for any work? [bbe] See, it is put into the fire for burning: the fire has made a meal of its two ends and the middle part of it is burned; is it good for any work? 15:5 [hgb] 完 全 的 时 候 尚 且 不 合 乎 什 么 工 用 ， 何 况 被 火 烧 坏 ， 还 能 合 乎 什 么 工 用 吗 ？ [kjv] Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for any work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned? [bbe] Truly, before it was cut down, it was not used for any purpose: how much less, when the fire has made a meal of it and it is burned, will it be made into anything? 15:6 [hgb] 所 以 ， 主 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 众 树 以 内 的 葡 萄 树 ， 我 怎 样 使 它 在 火 中 当 柴 ， 也 必 照 样 待 耶 路 撒 冷 的 居 民 。 [kjv] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem. [bbe] For this cause the Lord has said: Like the vine-tree among the trees of the woods which I have given to the fire for burning, so will I give the people of Jerusalem. 15:7 [hgb] 我 必 向 他 们 变 脸 。 他 们 虽 从 火 中 出 来 ， 火 却 要 烧 灭 他 们 。 我 向 他 们 变 脸 的 时 候 ， 你 们 就 知 道 我 是 耶 和 华 。 [kjv] And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one fire, and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them. [bbe] And my face will be turned against them; and though they have come out of the fire they will be burned up by it; and it will be clear to you that I am the Lord when my face is turned against them. 15:8 [hgb] 我 必 使 地 土 荒 凉 ， 因 为 他 们 行 事 干 犯 我 。 这 是 主 耶 和 华 说 的 。 [kjv] And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord GOD. [bbe] And I will make the land a waste because they have done evil, says the Lord.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/132/1983.html","bookId":156,"book":{"id":156,"title":"以西结书 Ezekiel","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 当 三 十 年 四 月 初 五 日 ， 以 西 结 （ 原 文 作 我 ） 在 迦 巴 鲁 河 边 被 掳 的 人 中 ， 天 就 开 了 ， 得 见 神 的 异 象 。 [kjv] Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/132","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
