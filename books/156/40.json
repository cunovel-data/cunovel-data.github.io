[bbe] In the twenty-fifth year after we had been taken away prisoners, in the first month of the year, on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the town was taken, on the very same day, the hand of the Lord was on me, and he took me there. 40:2 [hgb] 在 神 的 异 象 中 带 我 到 以 色 列 地 ， 安 置 在 至 高 的 山 上 。 在 山 上 的 南 边 有 仿 佛 一 座 城 建 立 。 [kjv] In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the south. [bbe] In the visions of God he took me into the land of Israel, and put me down on a very high mountain, on which there was, as it seemed, a building like a town opposite me. 40:3 [hgb] 他 带 我 到 那 里 ， 见 有 一 人 ， 颜 色 （ 原 文 作 形 状 ） 如 铜 ， 手 拿 麻 绳 和 量 度 的 竿 ， 站 在 门 口 。 [kjv] And he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate. [bbe] He took me there, and I saw a man, looking like brass, with a linen cord in his hand and a measuring rod: and he was stationed in the doorway. 40:4 [hgb] 那 人 对 我 说 ， 人 子 阿 ， 凡 我 所 指 示 你 的 ， 你 都 要 用 眼 看 ， 用 耳 听 ， 并 要 放 在 心 上 。 我 带 你 到 这 里 来 ， 特 为 要 指 示 你 。 凡 你 所 见 的 ， 你 都 要 告 诉 以 色 列 家 。 [kjv] And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew them unto thee art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel. [bbe] And the man said to me, Son of man, see with your eyes and give hearing with your ears, and take to heart everything I am going to let you see; for in order that I might let you see them, you have come here: and give an account of all you see to the children of Israel. 40:5 [hgb] 我 见 殿 四 围 有 墙 。 那 人 手 拿 量 度 的 竿 ， 长 六 肘 ， 每 肘 是 一 肘 零 一 掌 。 他 用 竿 量 墙 ， 厚 一 竿 ， 高 一 竿 。 [kjv] And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man\u0027s hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed. [bbe] And there was a wall on the outside of the house all round, and in the man\u0027s hand there was a measuring rod six cubits long by a cubit and a hand\u0027s measure: so he took the measure of the building from side to side, one rod; and from base to top, one rod. 40:6 [hgb] 他 到 了 朝 东 的 门 ， 就 上 门 的 台 阶 ， 量 门 的 这 槛 ， 宽 一 竿 。 又 量 门 的 那 槛 ， 宽 一 竿 。 [kjv] Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad; and the other threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad. [bbe] Then he came to the doorway looking to the east, and went up by its steps; and he took the measure of the doorstep, one rod wide. 40:7 [hgb] 又 有 卫 房 ， 每 房 长 一 竿 ， 宽 一 竿 ， 相 隔 五 肘 。 门 槛 ， 就 是 挨 着 向 殿 的 廊 门 槛 ， 宽 一 竿 。 [kjv] And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed.
