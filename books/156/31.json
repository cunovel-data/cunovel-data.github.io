Whom art thou like in thy greatness? \n [bbe] Son of man, say to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and to his people; Whom are you like in your great power? \n 31:3 [hgb] 亚 述 王 曾 如 利 巴 嫩 中 的 香 柏 树 ， 枝 条 荣 美 ， 影 密 如 林 ， 极 其 高 大 ， 树 尖 插 入 云 中 。 \n [kjv] Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs. \n [bbe] See, a pine-tree with beautiful branches and thick growth, giving shade and very tall; and its top was among the clouds. \n 31:4 [hgb] 众 水 使 它 生 长 。 深 水 使 它 长 大 。 所 栽 之 地 有 江 河 围 流 ， 汊 出 的 水 道 延 到 田 野 诸 树 。 \n [kjv] The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field. \n [bbe] It got strength from the waters and the deep made it tall: its streams went round about its planted land and it sent out its waterways to all the trees of the field. \n 31:5 [hgb] 所 以 它 高 大 超 过 田 野 诸 树 。 发 旺 的 时 候 ， 枝 子 繁 多 ， 因 得 大 水 之 力 枝 条 长 长 。 \n [kjv] Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth. \n [bbe] In this way it became taller than all the trees of the field; and its branches were increased and its arms became long because of the great waters. \n 31:6 [hgb] 空 中 的 飞 鸟 都 在 枝 子 上 搭 窝 。 田 野 的 走 兽 都 在 枝 条 下 生 子 。 所 有 大 国 的 人 民 都 在 它 荫 下 居 住 。 \n [kjv] All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations. \n [bbe] In its branches all the birds of heaven came to rest, and under its arms all the beasts of the field gave birth to their young, and great nations were living in its shade. \n 31:7 [hgb] 树 大 条 长 ， 成 为 荣 美 ， 因 为 根 在 众 水 之 旁 。 \n [kjv] Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters. \n [bbe] So it was beautiful, being so tall and its branches so long, for its root was by great waters. \n 31:8 [hgb] 神 园 中 的 香 柏 树 不 能 遮 蔽 它 。 松 树 不 及 它 的 枝 子 。 枫 树 不 及 它 的 枝 条 。 神 园 中 的 树 都 没 有 它 荣 美 。 \n [kjv] The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty. \n [bbe] No cedars were equal to it in the garden of God; the fir-trees were not like its branches, and plane-trees were as nothing in comparison with its arms; no tree in the garden of God was so beautiful. \n 31:9 [hgb] 我 使 它 的 枝 条 蕃 多 ， 成 为 荣 美 ， 以 致 神 伊 甸 园 中 的 树 都 嫉 妒 它 。 \n [kjv] I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him. \n [bbe] I made it beautiful with its mass of branches: so that all the trees in the garden of God were full of envy of it. \n 31:10 [hgb] 所 以 主 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 因 它 高 大 ， 树 尖 插 入 云 中 ， 心 骄 气 傲 ， \n [kjv] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height; \n [bbe] For this cause the Lord has said: Because he is tall, and has put his top among the clouds, and his heart is full of pride because he is so high, \n 31:11 [hgb] 我 就 必 将 它 交 给 列 国 中 大 有 威 势 的 人 。 他 必 定 办 它 。 我 因 它 的 罪 恶 ， 已 经 驱 逐 它 。 \n [kjv] I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness. \n [bbe] I have given him up into the hands of a strong one of the nations; he will certainly give him the reward of his sin, driving him out. \n 31:12 [hgb] 外 邦 人 ， 就 是 列 邦 中 强 暴 的 ， 将 它 砍 断 弃 掉 。 它 的 枝 条 落 在 山 间 和 一 切 谷 中 ， 它 的 枝 子 折 断 ， 落 在 地 的 一 切 河 旁 。 地 上 的 众 民 已 经 走 去 ， 离 开 它 的 荫 下 。 \n [kjv] And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him. \n [bbe] And men from strange lands, who are to be feared among the nations, after cutting him off, have let him be: on the mountains and in all the valleys his branches have come down; his arms are broken by all the waterways of the land; all the peoples of the earth have gone from his shade, and have let him be. \n 31:13 [hgb] 空 中 的 飞 鸟 都 要 宿 在 这 败 落 的 树 上 ， 田 野 的 走 兽 都 要 卧 在 它 的 枝 条 下 ， \n [kjv] Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches: \n [bbe] All the birds of heaven have come to rest on his broken stem where it is stretched on the earth, and all the beasts of the field will be on his branches: \n 31:14 [hgb] 好 使 水 旁 的 诸 树 不 因 高 大 而 自 尊 ， 也 不 将 树 尖 插 入 云 中 ， 并 且 那 些 得 水 滋 润 ， 有 势 力 的 ， 也 不 得 高 大 自 立 。 因 为 它 们 在 世 人 中 ， 和 下 坑 的 人 都 被 交 与 死 亡 ， 到 阴 府 去 了 。 \n [kjv] To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit. \n [bbe] In order that no trees by the waters may be lifted up in their growth, putting their tops among the clouds; and that no trees which are watered may take their place on high: for they are all given up to death, to the lowest parts of the earth among the children of men, with those who go down to the underworld. \n 31:15 [hgb] 主 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 它 下 阴 间 的 那 日 ， 我 便 使 人 悲 哀 。 我 为 它 遮 盖 深 渊 ， 使 江 河 凝 结 ， 大 水 停 流 。 我 也 使 利 巴 嫩 为 它 凄 惨 ， 田 野 的 诸 树 都 因 它 发 昏 。 \n [kjv] Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him. \n [bbe] This is what the Lord has said: The day when he goes down to the underworld, I will make the deep full of grief for him; I will keep back her streams and the great waters will be stopped: I will make Lebanon dark for him, and all the trees of the field will be feeble because of him. \n 31:16 [hgb] 我 将 它 扔 到 阴 间 ， 与 下 坑 的 人 一 同 下 去 。 那 时 ， 列 国 听 见 它 坠 落 的 响 声 就 都 震 动 ， 并 且 伊 甸 的 一 切 树 就 是 利 巴 嫩 得 水 滋 润 ， 最 佳 最 美 的 树 都 在 阴 府 受 了 安 慰 。 \n [kjv] I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth. \n [bbe] I will send shaking on the nations at the sound of his fall, when I send him down to the underworld with those who go down into the deep: and on earth they will be comforting themselves, all the trees of Eden, the best of Lebanon, even all the watered ones. \n 31:17 [hgb] 它 们 也 与 它 同 下 阴 间 ， 到 被 杀 的 人 那 里 。 它 们 曾 作 它 的 膀 臂 ， 在 列 国 中 它 的 荫 下 居 住 。 \n [kjv] They also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen. \n [bbe] And they will go down with him to the underworld, to those who have been put to the sword; even those who were his helpers, living under his shade among the nations \n 31:18 [hgb] 在 这 样 荣 耀 威 势 上 ， 在 伊 甸 园 诸 树 中 ， 谁 能 与 你 相 比 呢 ？ 然 而 你 要 与 伊 甸 的 诸 树 一 同 下 到 阴 府 ， 在 未 受 割 礼 的 人 中 ， 与 被 杀 的 人 一 同 躺 卧 。 法 老 和 他 的 群 众 乃 是 如 此 。 这 是 主 耶 和 华 说 的 。 \n [kjv] To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD. \n [bbe] Whom then are you like? for you will be sent down with the trees of Eden into the lowest parts of the earth: there you will be stretched out among those without circumcision, with those who were put to the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his people, says the Lord. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/132/1999.html","bookId":156,"book":{"id":156,"title":"以西结书 Ezekiel","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 当 三 十 年 四 月 初 五 日 ， 以 西 结 （ 原 文 作 我 ） 在 迦 巴 鲁 河 边 被 掳 的 人 中 ， 天 就 开 了 ， 得 见 神 的 异 象 。 [kjv] Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/132","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
