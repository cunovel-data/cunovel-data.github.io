[bbe] Then anyone who, hearing the sound of the horn, does not take note of it, will himself be responsible for his death, if the sword comes and takes him away. 33:5 [hgb] 他 听 见 角 声 ， 不 受 警 戒 ， 他 的 罪 必 归 到 自 己 的 身 上 。 他 若 受 警 戒 ， 便 是 救 了 自 己 的 性 命 。 [kjv] He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul. [bbe] On hearing the sound of the horn, he did not take note; his blood will be on him; for if he had taken note his life would have been safe. 33:6 [hgb] 倘 若 守 望 的 人 见 刀 剑 临 到 ， 不 吹 角 ， 以 致 民 不 受 警 戒 ， 刀 剑 来 杀 了 他 们 中 间 的 一 个 人 ， 他 虽 然 死 在 罪 孽 之 中 ， 我 却 要 向 守 望 的 人 讨 他 丧 命 的 罪 （ 罪 原 文 作 血 ） 。 [kjv] But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman\u0027s hand. [bbe] But if the watchman sees the sword coming, and does not give a note on the horn, and the people have no word of the danger, and the sword comes and takes any person from among them; he will be taken away in his sin, but I will make the watchman responsible for his blood. 33:7 [hgb] 人 子 阿 ， 我 照 样 立 你 作 以 色 列 家 守 望 的 人 。 所 以 你 要 听 我 口 中 的 话 ， 替 我 警 戒 他 们 。 [kjv] So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me. [bbe] So you, son of man, I have made you a watchman for the children of Israel; and you are to give ear to the word of my mouth and give them news from me of their danger. 33:8 [hgb] 我 对 恶 人 说 ， 恶 人 哪 ， 你 必 要 死 。 你 以 西 结 若 不 开 口 警 戒 恶 人 ， 使 他 离 开 所 行 的 道 ， 这 恶 人 必 死 在 罪 孽 之 中 ， 我 却 要 向 你 讨 他 丧 命 的 罪 （ 罪 原 文 作 血 ） 。 [kjv] When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. [bbe] When I say to the evil-doer, Death will certainly overtake you; and you say nothing to make clear to the evil-doer the danger of his way; death will overtake that evil man in his evil-doing, but I will make you responsible for his blood. 33:9 [hgb] 倘 若 你 警 戒 恶 人 转 离 所 行 的 道 ， 他 仍 不 转 离 ， 他 必 死 在 罪 孽 之 中 ， 你 却 救 自 己 脱 离 了 罪 。 [kjv] Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. [bbe] But if you make clear to the evil-doer the danger of his way for the purpose of turning him from it, and he is not turned from his way, death will overtake him in his evil-doing, but your life will be safe. 33:10 [hgb] 人 子 阿 ， 你 要 对 以 色 列 家 说 ， 你 们 常 说 ， 我 们 的 过 犯 罪 恶 在 我 们 身 上 ， 我 们 必 因 此 消 灭 ， 怎 能 存 活 呢 ？ [kjv] Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live? [bbe] And you, son of man, say to the children of Israel, You say, Our wrongdoing and our sins are on us and we are wasting away in them; how then may we have life? 33:11 [hgb] 你 对 他 们 说 ， 主 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 指 着 我 的 永 生 起 誓 ， 我 断 不 喜 悦 恶 人 死 亡 ， 惟 喜 悦 恶 人 转 离 所 行 的 道 而 活 。 以 色 列 家 阿 ， 你 们 转 回 ， 转 回 吧 。 离 开 恶 道 ， 何 必 死 亡 呢 ？ [kjv] Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel? [bbe] Say to them, By my life, says the Lord, I have no pleasure in the death of the evil-doer; it is more pleasing to me if he is turned from his way and has life: be turned, be turned from your evil ways; why are you looking for death, O children of Israel? 33:12 [hgb] 人 子 阿 ， 你 要 对 本 国 的 人 民 说 ， 义 人 的 义 ， 在 犯 罪 之 日 不 能 救 他 。 至 于 恶 人 的 恶 ， 在 他 转 离 恶 行 之 日 也 不 能 使 他 倾 倒 。 义 人 在 犯 罪 之 日 也 不 能 因 他 的 义 存 活 。 [kjv] Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth. [bbe] And you, son of man, say to the children of your people, The righteousness of the upright man will not make him safe in the day when he does wrong; and the evil-doing of the evil man will not be the cause of his fall in the day when he is turned from his evil-doing; and the upright man will not have life because of his righteousness in the day when he does evil. 33:13 [hgb] 我 对 义 人 说 ， 你 必 定 存 活 。 他 若 倚 靠 他 的 义 而 作 罪 孽 ， 他 所 行 的 义 都 不 被 记 念 。 他 必 因 所 作 的 罪 孽 死 亡 。 [kjv] When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it. [bbe] When I say to the upright that life will certainly be his; if he puts his faith in his righteousness and does evil, not one of his upright acts will be kept in memory; but in the evil he has done, death will overtake him. 33:14 [hgb] 再 者 ， 我 对 恶 人 说 ， 你 必 定 死 亡 。 他 若 转 离 他 的 罪 ， 行 正 直 与 合 理 的 事 ， [kjv] Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right; [bbe] And when I say to the evil-doer, Death will certainly be your fate; if he is turned from his sin and does what is ordered and right; 33:15 [hgb] 还 人 的 当 头 和 所 抢 夺 的 ， 遵 行 生 命 的 律 例 ， 不 作 罪 孽 ， 他 必 定 存 活 ， 不 致 死 亡 。 [kjv] If the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die. [bbe] If the evil-doer lets one who is in his debt have back what is his, and gives back what he had taken by force, and is guided by the rules of life, doing no evil; life will certainly be his, death will not overtake him. 33:16 [hgb] 他 所 犯 的 一 切 罪 必 不 被 记 念 。 他 行 了 正 直 与 合 理 的 事 ， 必 定 存 活 。 [kjv] None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live. [bbe] Not one of the sins which he has done will be kept in mind against him: he has done what is ordered and right, life will certainly be his. 33:17 [hgb] 你 本 国 的 子 民 还 说 ， 主 的 道 不 公 平 。 其 实 他 们 的 道 不 公 平 。 [kjv] Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal. [bbe] But the children of your people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: when it is they whose way is not equal. 33:18 [hgb] 义 人 转 离 他 的 义 而 作 罪 孽 ， 就 必 因 此 死 亡 。 [kjv] When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby. [bbe] When the upright man, turning away from his righteousness, does evil, death will overtake him in it. 33:19 [hgb] 恶 人 转 离 他 的 恶 ， 行 正 直 与 合 理 的 事 ， 就 必 因 此 存 活 。 [kjv] But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby. [bbe] And when the evil man, turning away from his evil-doing, does what is ordered and right, he will get life by it. 33:20 [hgb] 你 们 还 说 ， 主 的 道 不 公 平 。 以 色 列 家 阿 ， 我 必 按 你 们 各 人 所 行 的 审 判 你 们 。 [kjv] Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways. [bbe] And still you say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O children of Israel, I will be your judge, giving to everyone the reward of his ways. 33:21 [hgb] 我 们 被 掳 之 后 十 二 年 十 月 初 五 日 ， 有 人 从 耶 路 撒 冷 逃 到 我 这 里 ， 说 ， 城 已 攻 破 。 [kjv] And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten. [bbe] Now in the twelfth year after we had been taken away prisoners, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month, one who had got away in flight from Jerusalem came to me, saying, The town has been taken. 33:22 [hgb] 逃 来 的 人 未 到 前 一 日 的 晚 上 ， 耶 和 华 的 灵 （ 原 文 作 手 ） 降 在 我 身 上 ， 开 我 的 口 。 到 第 二 日 早 晨 ， 那 人 来 到 我 这 里 ， 我 口 就 开 了 ， 不 再 缄 默 。 [kjv] Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb. [bbe] Now the hand of the Lord had been on me in the evening, before the man who had got away came to me; and he made my mouth open, ready for his coming to me in the morning; and my mouth was open and I was no longer without voice. 33:23 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 话 临 到 我 说 ， [kjv] Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, [bbe] And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 33:24 [hgb] 人 子 阿 ， 住 在 以 色 列 荒 废 之 地 的 人 说 ， 亚 伯 拉 罕 独 自 一 人 能 得 这 地 为 业 ， 我 们 人 数 众 多 ， 这 地 更 是 给 我 们 为 业 的 。 [kjv] Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance. [bbe] Son of man, those who are living in these waste places in the land of Israel say, Abraham was but one, and he had land for his heritage: but we are a great number; the land is given to us for our heritage. 33:25 [hgb] 所 以 你 要 对 他 们 说 ， 主 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 你 们 吃 带 血 的 物 ， 仰 望 偶 像 ， 并 且 杀 人 流 血 ， 你 们 还 能 得 这 地 为 业 吗 ？ [kjv] Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land? [bbe] For this cause say to them, This is what the Lord has said: You take your meat with the blood, your eyes are lifted up to your images, and you are takers of life: are you to have the land for your heritage? 33:26 [hgb] 你 们 倚 仗 自 己 的 刀 剑 行 可 憎 的 事 ， 人 人 玷 污 邻 舍 的 妻 ， 你 们 还 能 得 这 地 为 业 吗 ？ [kjv] Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbour\u0027s wife: and shall ye possess the land? [bbe] You put your faith in your swords, you do disgusting things, everyone takes his neighbour\u0027s wife: are you to have the land for your heritage? 33:27 [hgb] 你 要 对 他 们 这 样 说 ， 主 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 我 指 着 我 的 永 生 起 誓 ， 在 荒 场 中 的 ， 必 倒 在 刀 下 。 在 田 野 间 的 ， 必 交 给 野 兽 吞 吃 。 在 保 障 和 洞 里 的 ， 必 遭 瘟 疫 而 死 。 [kjv] Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence. [bbe] This is what you are to say to them: The Lord has said, By my life, truly, those who are in the waste places will be put to the sword, and him who is in the open field I will give to the beasts for their food, and those who are in the strong places and in holes in the rocks will come to their death by disease. 33:28 [hgb] 我 必 使 这 地 荒 凉 ， 令 人 惊 骇 。 她 因 势 力 而 有 的 骄 傲 也 必 止 息 。 以 色 列 的 山 都 必 荒 凉 ， 无 人 经 过 。 [kjv] For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall pass through. [bbe] And I will make the land a waste and a cause of wonder, and the pride of her strength will come to an end; and the mountains of Israel will be made waste so that no one will go through. 33:29 [hgb] 我 因 他 们 所 行 一 切 可 憎 的 事 使 地 荒 凉 ， 令 人 惊 骇 。 那 时 ， 他 们 就 知 道 我 是 耶 和 华 。 [kjv] Then shall they know that I am the LORD, when I have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed. [bbe] Then they will be certain that I am the Lord, when I have made the land a waste and a cause of wonder, because of all the disgusting things which they have done, 33:30 [hgb] 人 子 阿 ， 你 本 国 的 子 民 在 墙 垣 旁 边 ， 在 房 屋 门 口 谈 论 你 。 弟 兄 对 弟 兄 彼 此 说 ， 来 吧 。 听 听 有 什 么 话 从 耶 和 华 而 出 。 [kjv] Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the LORD. [bbe] And as for you, son of man, the children of your people are talking together about you by the walls and in the doorways of the houses, saying to one another, Come now, give ear to the word which comes from the Lord. 33:31 [hgb] 他 们 来 到 你 这 里 如 同 民 来 聚 会 ， 坐 在 你 面 前 仿 佛 是 我 的 民 。 他 们 听 你 的 话 却 不 去 行 。 因 为 他 们 的 口 多 显 爱 情 ， 心 却 追 随 财 利 。 [kjv] And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they shew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetousness. [bbe] And they come to you as my people come, and are seated before you as my people, hearing your words but doing them not: for deceit is in their mouth and their heart goes after profit for themselves. 33:32 [hgb] 他 们 看 你 如 善 于 奏 乐 ， 声 音 幽 雅 之 人 所 唱 的 雅 歌 ， 他 们 听 你 的 话 却 不 去 行 。 [kjv] And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear thy words, but they do them not. [bbe] And truly you are to them like a love song by one who has a very pleasing voice and is an expert player on an instrument: for they give ear to your words but do them not. 33:33 [hgb] 看 哪 ， 所 说 的 快 要 应 验 。 应 验 了 ， 他 们 就 知 道 在 他 们 中 间 有 了 先 知 。 [kjv] And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them. [bbe] And when this comes about (see, it is coming), then it will be clear to them that a prophet has been among them.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/132/2001.html","bookId":156,"book":{"id":156,"title":"以西结书 Ezekiel","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 当 三 十 年 四 月 初 五 日 ， 以 西 结 （ 原 文 作 我 ） 在 迦 巴 鲁 河 边 被 掳 的 人 中 ， 天 就 开 了 ， 得 见 神 的 异 象 。 [kjv] Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/132","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
