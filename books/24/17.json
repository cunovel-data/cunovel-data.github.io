{"id":690,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER VII NINE HUNDRED POUNDS","content":"Bobby Ravenshaw did not spend the day at the Charing Cross Hotel waiting for Simon; he amused himself otherwise, leaving Mudd to do the waiting. At eleven o\u0027clock he called at the hotel. Mr. Mudd was upstairs in Mr. Pettigrew\u0027s room, and he would be called down. Bobby thought that he could trace a lot of things in the porter\u0027s tone and manner, a respect and commiseration for Mr. Mudd and perhaps not quite such a high respect for himself and Simon. He fancied that the hotel was beginning to have its eye upon him and Simon as questionable parties of the bon vivant type—a fancy that may have been baseless, but was still there. Then Mudd appeared. \"Well, Mudd,\" said Bobby, \"hasn\u0027t he turned up yet?\" \"No, Mr. Robert.\" \"Where on earth can he be?\" \"I\u0027m givin\u0027 him till half-past eleven,\" said Mudd, \"and then I\u0027m off to Vine Street.\" \"What on earth for?\" \"To have the hospitals circulated to ask about him.\" \"Oh, nonsense!\" \"It\u0027s on my mind he\u0027s had an accident,\" said Mudd. \"Robbed and stunned, or drugged with opium and left in the street. I know London—and him as he is! He\u0027ll be found with his pockets inside out—I know London. You should have got him down to the country to-day, Mr. Robert, somewhere quiet; now, maybe, it\u0027s too late.\" \"It\u0027s very easy to say that. I tried to, and he wouldn\u0027t go, not even to Richmond. London seems to hold him like a charm; he\u0027s like a bee in a bottle—can\u0027t escape.\" At this moment a horrid little girl in a big hat and feathers, boots too large for her, and a shawl, made her appearance at the entrance door, saw the hall porter and came towards him. She had a letter in her hand. The hall porter took the letter, looked at it, and brought it to Mudd. Mudd glanced at the envelope and tore it open. \"10, Duke Street, \"Leicester Square \"Mr. Modd, \"Come at once. \"Celestine Rossignol.\" That was all, written in an angular, old-fashioned hand and in purple ink. \"Where\u0027s my hat?\" cried Mudd, running about like a decapitated fowl. \"Where\u0027s my hat? Oh ay, it\u0027s upstairs!\" He vanished, and in a minute reappeared with his hat; then, with Bobby, and followed by the dirty little girl trotting behind them, off they started. They tried to question the little girl on the way, but she knew nothing definite. The gentleman had been brought \u0027ome—didn\u0027t know what was wrong with him; the lady had given her the letter to take; that was all she knew. \"He\u0027s alive, anyway,\" said Bobby. \"The Lord knows!\" said Mudd. The little girl let them in with a key and, Mudd leading the way, up the stairs they went. Mudd knocked at the door of the sitting-room. Madame and Cerise were there, quite calm,[Pg 167] and evidently waiting; of Simon there was not a trace. \"Oh, Mr. Modd,\" cried the old lady, \"how fortunate you have received my letter! Poor Monsieur Pattigrew——\" \"He ain\u0027t dead?\" cried Mudd. No, Simon was not dead. She told. Poor Monsieur Pattigrew and a very big gentleman had arrived over an hour ago. Mr. Pattigrew could not stand; he had been taken ill, the big gentleman had declared. Such a nice gentleman, who had sat down and cried whilst Mr. Pattigrew had been placed on the sofa—taken ill in the street. The big gentleman had gone for a doctor, but had not yet returned. Mr. Pattigrew had been put to bed. She and the big gentleman had seen to that. Mr. Pattigrew had recovered consciousness for a moment during this operation and had produced a number of bank-notes—such a number! She had placed them safely in her desk; that was one of the reasons she had sent so urgently for Mr. Modd. She produced the notes—a huge sheaf. Mudd took them and examined them dazedly, hundreds and hundreds of pounds\u0027 worth of notes; and he had only started with two hundred pounds! \"Why, there\u0027s nearly a thousand pounds\u0027 worth here,\" said Mudd. Bobby\u0027s astonishment might have been greater had not his eyes rested, from the first moment of their coming in, on Cerise. Cerise with parted lips, a heightened colour, and the air of a little child at a play she did not quite understand. She was lovely. French, innocent, lovely as a flower—a new thing in London, he had never seen anything quite like her before. The poverty of the room, Uncle Simon, his worries and troubles, all were banished or eased. She was music, and if Saul could have seen her he would have had no need for David. Had Uncle Simon added burglary to knocker-snatching, broken into a jeweller\u0027s and disposed of his takings to a \"fence,\" committed robbery? All these thoughts strayed over his mind, harmless because of Cerise. The unfortunate young man, who had fooled so long with girls, had met the girl who had been waiting for him since the beginning of the world. There is always that; she may be blowsy, she may be plain, or lovely like Cerise—she is Fate. \"And here is the big gentleman\u0027s card,\" said Madame, taking a visiting card from her desk, then another and another. \"He gave me three.\" Mudd handed the card to Bobby, who read: \"The Hon. Richard Pugeot, \"Pall Mall Place, St. James. \"Guards\u0027 Club.\" \"I know him,\" said Bobby. \"That\u0027s all right, and Uncle Simon couldn\u0027t have fallen into better hands.\" \"Is, then, Monsieur Pattigrew your oncle?\" asked the old lady. \"He is, Madame.\" \"Then you are thrice welcome here, monsieur,\" said she. Cerise looked the words, and Bobby\u0027s eyes as they met hers returned thanks. \"Come,\" said Madame, \"you shall see him and that he is safe.\" She gently opened the door leading to the bedroom, and there, in a little bed, dainty and white—Cerise\u0027s little bed—lay Uncle Simon, flushed and smiling and snoring. \"Poor Monsieur Pattigrew!\" murmured the old lady. Then they withdrew. It seemed that there was another bed to be got in the house for Cerise, and Mudd, taking[Pg 170] charge of the patient, the ladies withdrew. It was agreed that no doctor was wanted. It was also agreed between Bobby and Mudd that the hotel was impossible after this. \"We must get him away to the country tomorrow,\" said Mudd, \"if he\u0027ll go.\" \"He\u0027ll go, if I have to take him tied up and bound,\" said Bobby. \"My nerves won\u0027t stand another day of this. Take care of those notes, Mudd, and don\u0027t let him see them. They\u0027ll be useful getting him away. I\u0027ll be round as early as I can. I\u0027ll see Pugeot and get the rights of the matter from him. Good night.\" Off he went. In the street he paused for a moment, then he took a passing taxi for the Albany. Tozer was in, playing patience and smoking. He did not interrupt his game for the other. \"Well, how\u0027s Uncle Simon?\" asked Tozer. \"He\u0027s asleep at last after a most rampageous day.\" \"You look pretty sober.\" \"Don\u0027t mention it,\" said Bobby, going to a tantalus case and helping himself to some whisky. \"My nerves are all unstrung.\" \"Trailing after him?\" \"Thank God, no!\" said Bobby. \"Waiting for him to turn up dead, bruised, battered, or[Pg 171] simply intoxicated and stripped of his money. He gave me the slip in Piccadilly with two hundred-pound notes in his pocket. The next place I find him was half an hour ago in a young lady\u0027s bed, dead to the world, smiling, and with nearly a thousand pounds in bank-notes he\u0027d hived somehow during the day.\" \"A thousand pounds!\" \"Yes, and he\u0027d only started with two hundred.\" \"I say,\" said Tozer, forgetting his cards, \"what a chap he must have been when he was young!\" \"When he was young! Lord, I don\u0027t want to see him any younger than he is; if this is youth, give me old age.\" \"You\u0027ll get it fast enough,\" said Tozer, \"don\u0027t you worry; and this will be a reminder to you to keep old. There\u0027s an Arab proverb that says, \u0027There are two things colder than ice, an old young man and a young old man.\u0027\" \"Colder than ice!\" said Bobby. \"I wish you had five minutes with Uncle Simon.\" \"But who was this lady—this young——\" \"Two of the nicest people on earth,\" said Bobby, \"an old lady and her daughter—French. He saved the girl in an omnibus accident or something in one of his escapades, and[Pg 172] took her home to her mother. Then to-night he must have remembered them, and got a friend to take him there. Fancy, the cheek! What made him, in his state, able to remember them?\" \"What is the young lady like?\" \"She\u0027s beautiful,\" said Bobby; then he took a sip of whisky-and-soda and failed to meet Tozer\u0027s eye as he put down the glass. \"That\u0027s what made him remember her,\" said Tozer. Bobby laughed. \"It\u0027s no laughing matter,\" said the other, \"at his age—when the heart is young.\" Bobby laughed again. \"Bobby,\" said Tozer, \"beware of that girl.\" \"I\u0027m not thinking of the girl,\" said Bobby; \"I\u0027m thinking how on earth the old man——\" \"The youth, you mean.\" \"Got all that money.\" \"You\u0027re a liar,\" said Tozer; \"you are thinking of the girl.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1832/53118.html","bookId":24,"book":{"id":24,"title":"The Man Who Found Himself","description":"简介： King Charles Street lies in Westminster; you turn a corner and find yourself in Charles Street as one might turn a corner and find oneself in History.
