{"id":688,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER V THE HOME OF THE NIGHTINGALES","content":"Mudd, with the ten-pound note and the written address, had started that morning with the intention of doing another errand as well. He first took a cab to King Charles Street. It was a relief to find it there, and that the house had not been burned down in the night. Fire was one of Mudd\u0027s haunting dreads—fire and the fear of a mistress. He had extinguishing-bombs hung in every passage, besides red, cone-shaped extinguishers. If he could have had bombs to put out the flames of love and keep women away he no doubt would have had them. \n \n Mrs. Jukes received him, and he enquired if the plate had been locked up. Then he visited his own room and examined his bank-book to see if it were safe and untampered with; then he had a glass of ginger wine for his stomach\u0027s sake. \n \n \"Where are you off to now?\" asked Mrs. Jukes. \n \n \"On business for the master,\" replied Mudd. \"I\u0027ve some law papers to take to an address. Lord! look at those brasses! Haven\u0027t the girls no hands? Place going to rack and ruin if I leave it two instant minits. And look at that fender—sure you put the chain on the hall door last night?\" \n \n \"Sure.\" \n \n \"Well, be sure you do it, for there\u0027s another Jack-the-Ripper chap goin\u0027 about the West End, I\u0027ve heard, and he may be in on you if you don\u0027t.\" \n \n Having frightened Mrs. Jukes into the sense of the necessity for chains as well as bolts, Mudd put on his hat, blew his nose, and departed, banging the door behind him and making sure it was shut. \n \n There is a flower shop in the street at the end of King Charles Street. He entered, bought his bouquet, and with it in his hand left the establishment. He was looking for a cab to hide himself in; he found none, but he met a fellow butler, Judge Ponsonby\u0027s man. \n \n \"Hello, Mr. Mudd,\" said the other; \"going courting?\" \n \n \"Mrs. Jukes asked me to take them to a female friend that\u0027s goin\u0027 to be married,\" said Mudd. \n \n The bouquet was not extraordinarily large, but it seemed to grow larger. \n \n Condemned to take an omnibus in lieu of a cab, it seemed to fill the omnibus; people looked at it and then at Mudd. It seemed to him that he was condemned to carry Simon\u0027s folly bare in the face of the world. Then he remembered what he had said about the recipient going to be married. Was that an omen? \n \n Mudd believed in omens. If his elbow itched—and it had itched yesterday—he was going to sleep in a strange bed; he never killed spiders, and he tested \"strangers\" in the tea-cup to see if they were male or female. \n \n The omen was riding him now, and he got out of the omnibus and sought the street of his destination, feeling almost as though he were a fantastic bridesmaid at some nightmare wedding, with Simon in the r?le of groom. \n \n That Simon should select a wife in this gloomy street off Leicester Square, and in this drab-looking house at whose door he was knocking, did not occur to Mudd. What did occur to him was that some hussy living in this house had put her spell on Simon and might select him for a husband, marry him at a registrar office before his temporary youth had departed, and come and reign at Charles Street. \n \n Mudd\u0027s dreaded imaginary mistress had always figured in his mind\u0027s eye as a stout lady—eminently a lady—who would interfere with his ideas of how the brasses ought to be polished, interfere with tradesmen, order Mudd about, and make herself generally a nuisance; this new imaginary horror was a \"painted slut,\" who would bring ridicule and disgrace on Simon and all belonging to him. \n \n Mudd had the fine feelings of an old maid on matters like this, backed by a fine knowledge of what elderly men are capable of in the way of folly with women. \n \n Did not Mr. Justice Thurlow marry his cook? \n \n He rang at the dingy hall door and it was opened by a dingy little girl in a print dress. \n \n \"Does Miss Rosinol live here?\" asked Mudd. \n \n \"Yus.\" \n \n \"Can I see her?\" \n \n \"Wait a minit,\" said the dingy one. She clattered up the stairs; she seemed to wear hobnailed boots to judge by the noise. A minute elapsed, and then she clattered down again. \n \n \"Come in, plaaze,\" said the little girl. \n \n Mudd obeyed and followed upstairs, holding on to the shaky banister with his left hand,[Pg 148] carrying the bouquet in his right, feeling as though he were a vicious man walking upstairs in a dream; feeling no longer like Mudd. \n \n The little girl opened a door, and there was the \"painted hussy\"—old Madame Rossignol sitting at a table with books spread open before her and writing. \n \n She translated—as before said—English books into French, novels mostly. \n \n The bouquet of last night had been broken up; there were flowers in vases and about the room; despite its shabbiness, there was an atmosphere of cleanliness and high decency that soothed the stricken soul of Mudd. \n \n \"I\u0027m Mr. Pettigrew\u0027s man,\" said Mudd, \"and he asked me to bring you these flowers.\" \n \n \"Ah, Monsieur Seemon Pattigrew,\" cried the old lady, her face lighting. \"Come in, monsieur. Cerise!—Cerise!—a gentilmon from Mr. Pattigrew. Will you not take a seat, monsieur?\" \n \n Mudd, handing over the flowers, sat down, and at that moment in came Cerise from the bedroom adjoining. Cerise, fresh and dainty, with wide blue eyes that took in Mudd and the flowers, that seemed to take in at the same time the whole of spring and summer. \n \n \"Poor, but decent,\" said Mudd to himself. \n \n \"Monsieur,\" said the old lady, as Cerise ran off to get a bowl to put the flowers in, \"you are as welcome to us as your good kind master who saved my daughter yesterday. Will you convey to him our deepest respects and our thanks?\" \n \n \"Saved her?\" said Mudd. \n \n Madame explained. Cerise, arranging the flowers, joined in; they waxed enthusiastic. Never had Mudd been so chattered to before. He saw the whole business and guessed how the land lay now. He felt deeply relieved. Madame inspired him with instinctive confidence; Cerise in her youth and innocence repelled any idea of marriage between herself and Simon. But they\u0027d got to be warned, somehow, that Simon was off the spot. He began the warning seated there before the women and rubbing his knees gently, his eyes wandering about as though seeking inspiration from the furniture. \n \n Mr. Pettigrew was a very good master, but he had to be took care of; his health wasn\u0027t what it might be. He was older than he looked, but lately he had had an illness that had made him suddenly grow young again, as you might say; the doctors could not make it out, but he was just like a child sometimes, as you might say. \n \n \"I said it,\" cut in Madame. \"A boy—that is his charm.\" \n \n Well, Mudd did not know anything about charms, but he was often very anxious about Mr. Pettigrew. Then, little by little, the confidence the women inspired opened his flood-gates and his suppressed emotions came out. \n \n London was not good for Mr. Pettigrew\u0027s health—that was the truth; he ought to be got away quiet and out of excitement—doorknockers rose up before him as he said this—but he was very self-willed. It was strange a gentleman getting young again like this, and a great perplexity and trouble to an old man like him, Mudd. \n \n \"Ah, monsieur, he has been always young,\" said Madame; \"that heart could never grow old.\" \n \n Mudd shook his head. \n \n \"I\u0027ve known him for forty year,\" said he, \"and it has hit me cruel hard, his doing things he\u0027s never done before—not much; but there you are—he\u0027s different.\" \n \n \"I have known an old gentleman,\" said Madame—\"Monsieur de Mirabole—he, too, changed to be quite gay and young, as though spring had come to him. He wrote me verses,\" laughed Madame. \"Me, an old woman! I humoured him, did I not, Cerise? But I never read his verses; I could not humour him to that point.\" \n \n \"What happened to him?\" asked Mudd gloomily. \n \n \"Oh dear, he fell in love with Cerise,\" said Madame. \"He was very rich; he wanted to marry Cerise, did he not, Cerise?\" \n \n \"Oui, maman,\" replied Cerise, finishing the flowers. \n \n All this hit Mudd pleasantly. Sincere as sunshine, patently, obviously, truthful, this pair of females were beyond suspicion on the charge of setting nets for Simon. Also, and for the first time in his life, he came to know the comfort of a female mind when in trouble. His troubles up to this had been mostly about uncleaned brasses, corked wine, letters forgotten to be posted. In this whirlpool of amazement, like Poe\u0027s man in the descent of the maelstrom, who, clinging to a barrel, found that he was being sucked down slower, Mudd, clinging now to the female saving-something—sense, clarity of outlook, goodness, call it what you will—found comfort. \n \n He had opened his mind, the nightmare had lifted somewhat. Opening his mind to Bobby had not relieved him in the least; on the contrary, talking with Bobby, the situation had seemed more insane than ever. The two rigid masculine minds had followed one another, incapable of mutual help; the buoyant female \n \n Something incapable of strict definition was now to Mudd as the supporting barrel. He clutched at the idea of old Monsieur de Mirabole, who had got young again without coming to much mischief; he felt that Simon in falling upon these two females had fallen amongst pillows. He told them of Simon\u0027s message, that he would call upon them later in the day, and they laughed. \n \n \"He will be safe with us,\" said Madame; \"we will not let him come to \u0027arm. Do not be alarmed, Monsieur Mudd, the bon Dieu will surely protect an innocent so charming, so good—so much goodness may walk alone, even amongst tigers, even amongst lions; it will come to no \u0027arm. We will see that he returns to the Sharing Cross \u0027Otel—I will talk to \u0027im.\" \n \n Mudd departed, relieved, so great is the power of goodness, even though it shines in the persons of an impoverished old French lady and a girl whose innocence is her only strength. \n \n But his relief was not to be of long duration, for on entering the hotel, as before said, he met Bobby. \"He\u0027s gone,\" said Bobby; \"given me the slip; and he has two hundred-pound bank-notes with him, to say nothing of the rest.\" \n \n \"Oh, Lord!\" said Mudd. \n \n \"Can he have gone to see that girl? What\u0027s her address?\" \n \n \"What girl?\" asked Mudd. \n \n \"The girl you took the flowers to.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ve just been,\" said Mudd. \"No, he wasn\u0027t there. Wish he was; it\u0027s an old lady.\" \n \n \"Old lady!\" \n \n \"And her daughter. They\u0027re French folk, poor but honest, not a scrap of harm in them.\" He explained the Rossignol affair. \n \n \"Well, there\u0027s nothing to be done but sit down and wait,\" said Bobby. \n \n \"It\u0027s easy to say that. Me, with my nerves near gone.\" \n \n \"I know; mine are nearly as bad. \u0027Pon my soul, it\u0027s just as if one had lost a child. Mudd, we\u0027ve got to get him out of London; we\u0027ve got to do it.\" \n \n \"Get him back first,\" said Mudd. \"Get him back alive with all that money in his pocket. He\u0027ll be murdered before night, that\u0027s my opinion, I know London; or gaoled—and he\u0027ll give his right name.\" \n \n \"We\u0027ll tip the reporters if he is,\" said Bobby, \"and keep it out of the papers. I was run in once and I know the ropes. Cheer up, Mudd, and go and have a whisky-and-soda; you want bucking up, and so do I.\" \n \n \"Bucking up!\" said Mudd. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1832/53116.html","bookId":24,"book":{"id":24,"title":"The Man Who Found Himself","description":"简介： King Charles Street lies in Westminster; you turn a corner and find yourself in Charles Street as one might turn a corner and find oneself in History.
