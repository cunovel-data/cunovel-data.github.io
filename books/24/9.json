{"id":682,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER II MOXON AND MUDD","content":"Now, Moxon had come up that morning from Framlingham in Kent, where he was taking a holiday, to transact some business. Amongst other things he had to see Simon Pettigrew on a question about some bills. The apparition he had encountered in the hall of the Charing Cross Hotel pursued him to Plunder\u0027s office, where he first went, and, when he left Plunder\u0027s for luncheon at Prosser\u0027s, in Chancery Lane, it still pursued him. Though he knew it could not be Pettigrew, some uneasy spirit in his subconsciousness kept insisting that it was Pettigrew. At two o\u0027clock he called at Old Serjeants\u0027 Inn. He saw Brownlow, who had just returned from lunch. No, Mr. Pettigrew was not in. He had gone out that morning early and had not returned. \"I must see him,\" said Moxon. \"When do you think he will be in?\" Brownlow couldn\u0027t say. \"Would he be at his house, do you think?\" \"Hardly,\" said Brownlow; \"he might have gone home, but I think it\u0027s improbable.\" \"I must see him,\" said Moxon again. \"It\u0027s extraordinary. Why, I wrote to him telling him I was coming this afternoon and he knows the importance of my business.\" \"Mr. Pettigrew hasn\u0027t opened his morning letters yet,\" said Brownlow. \"Good Lord!\" said Moxon. Then, after a pause: \"Will you telephone to his house to see?\" \"Mr. Pettigrew has no telephone,\" said Brownlow; \"he dislikes them, except in business.\" Moxon remembered this and other old-fashioned traits in Pettigrew; the remembrance did not ease his irritation. \"Then I\u0027ll go to his house myself,\" said he. When he arrived at King Charles Street, Mudd opened the door. Mudd and Moxon were mutually known one to the other, Moxon having often dined there. \"Is your master in, Mudd?\" asked Moxon. \"No, sir,\" answered Mudd; \"he\u0027s not at home, and mayn\u0027t be at home for some time.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"He left me directions that if he wasn\u0027t at the office when the brougham called to take him to luncheon I was to tell the office he was called away; the coachman has just come back to say he wasn\u0027t there, so I am sending him back to the office to tell them.\" \"Called away! For how long?\" \"Well, it might be a month,\" said Mudd, remembering. \"Extraordinary!\" said Moxon. \"Well, I can\u0027t help it, and I can\u0027t wait; I must take my business elsewhere. I thought I saw Mr. Pettigrew in the Charing Cross Hotel, but he was dressed differently and seemed strange. Well, this is a great nuisance, but it can\u0027t be helped, I suppose.... A month....\" Off he went in a huff. Mudd watched him as he went, then he closed the hall door. Then he sat down on one of the hall chairs. \"Dressed differently and seemed strange.\" It only wanted those words to start alarm in the mind of Mudd. The affair of a year ago had always perplexed him, and now this! \"Seemed strange.\" Could it be?... H\u0027m.... He got up and went downstairs. \"Why, what\u0027s the matter with you, Mr. Mudd?\" asked the cook-housekeeper. \"Why, you\u0027re all of a shake.\" \"It\u0027s my stomach,\" said Mudd. He took a glass of ginger wine, then he fetched his hat. \"I\u0027m going out to get the air,\" said Mudd. \"I mayn\u0027t be back for some time; don\u0027t bother about me if I aren\u0027t, and be sure to lock up the plate.\" \"God bless my soul, what\u0027s the matter with the man?\" murmured the astonished housekeeper as Mudd vanished. \"Blest if he isn\u0027t getting as queer as his master!\" Out in the street Mudd paused to blow his nose in a bandanna handkerchief just like Simon\u0027s. Then, as though this act had started his mechanism, off he went, hailed an omnibus in the next street, and got off at Charing Cross. He entered the Charing Cross Hotel. \"Is a Mr. Pettigrew here?\" asked Mudd of the hall porter. The hail porter grinned. \"Yes, there\u0027s a Mr. Pettigrew staying here, but he\u0027s out.\" \"Well, I\u0027m his servant,\" said Mudd. \"Staying here with him?\" asked the porter. \"Yes. I\u0027ve followed him on. What\u0027s the number of his room?\" \"The office will know,\" replied the other. \"Well, just go to the office and get his key,\" said Mudd, \"and send a messenger boy to No. 12, King Charles Street—that\u0027s our address—to tell Mrs. Jukes, the housekeeper, I won\u0027t be able to get back to-night maybe. Here\u0027s a shilling for him—but show me his room first.\" Mudd carried conviction. The hall porter went to the office. \"Key of Mr. Pettigrew\u0027s room,\" said he; \"his servant has just come.\" The superior damsel detached herself from book-keeping, looked up the number and gave the key. Mudd took it and went up in the lift. He opened the door of the room and went in. The place had not been tidied, clothes lay everywhere. Mudd, like a cat in a strange house, looked around. Then he shut the door. Then he took up a coat and looked at the maker\u0027s name on the tab. \"Holland and Woolson\"—Simon\u0027s tailors! Then he examined all the garments. Such garments! Boating flannels, serge suits! Then the shoes, the patent leather boots. He opened[Pg 65] the chest of drawers and found the bundle of discarded clothes—the old coat with the left elbow \"going,\" and the rest. He held them up, examined them, folded them and put them back. Then he sat down to recover himself, blew his nose, wondered whether he or Simon were crazy, and then, rising up, began to fold and put away the new things in the wardrobe and chest-of-drawers. He noticed that one of the portmanteaux was locked. Yet there was something in it that slid up and down as he tilted and lowered it. Having looked round the room once again, he went downstairs, gave up the key, made arrangements for his room, and started out. He made for Sackville Street. Meyer, the foreman of Holland and Woolson\u0027s, was known to him. He had sometimes called regarding Simon\u0027s clothes with directions for this or that. \"That blue serge suit you\u0027ve just sent for Mr. Pettigrew don\u0027t quite rightly fit, Mr. Meyer,\" said the cunning Mudd. \"I had the coat done up in a parcel to bring back to you for the sleeves to be shortened half an inch, but I forgot it; only remembered I\u0027d forgot it at your door.\" \"We\u0027ll send for it,\" said Meyer. \"Right,\" said Mudd. Then, \"No—on second thoughts, I\u0027ll fetch it myself when I have a[Pg 66] moment to spare, for we\u0027re going from home for a few days. Mr. Pettigrew has had a good lot of clothes lately, Mr. Meyer.\" \"He has,\" said Meyer, with a twinkle in his eye; \"suits and suits, almost as if he were going to be married.\" \"Married!\" cried the other. \"What put that into your head, Mr. Meyer? He\u0027s not a marrying man. Why, I\u0027ve never seen him as much as glance an eye at a female.\" \"Oh, it was only my joke,\" said Meyer. Now, in Mudd\u0027s soul there had lain for years an uneasiness, a crumpled rose-leaf of thought that touched him sometimes as he turned at night in bed. It was the fear that some day Simon might ruin Mudd\u0027s life with a mistress. He couldn\u0027t stand a mistress. He had always sworn that to himself; the experience of fellow butlers whose lives were made loathsome by mistresses would have been enough without his own deep-rooted antipathy to females, except as spectacular objects. Mrs. Jukes was a relation of his, and he could stand her; the maid-servants were automata beneath his notice—but a mistress! Mad alarm filled his mind, for his heart told him that the words of Meyer had foundation in probability. That affair of last year, when Simon had departed and returned in new strange clothes, might have been the courting, this the real thing? He left the tailor\u0027s, called a taxi and drove to the office. Brownlow was in. \"What is it, Mudd?\" asked Brownlow, as the latter was shown into his room. \"Did you get my message, Mr. Brownlow?\" asked Mudd. \"Yes.\" \"Oh, that\u0027s all right,\" said Mudd. \"I just thought I\u0027d call and ask. The master told me to send the message; he\u0027s going away for a bit. Wants a change, too. I think he\u0027s been overworking lately, Mr. Brownlow.\" \"He\u0027s always overworking,\" said Brownlow. \"I think he\u0027s been suffering from brain-fag, Mudd; he\u0027s very reticent about himself, but I\u0027m glad he saw a doctor.\" \"Saw a doctor! Why, he never told me.\" \"Didn\u0027t he? Well, he did—Dr. Oppenshaw, of Harley Street. This is between you and me. Try and make him rest more, Mudd.\" \"I will,\" said Mudd. \"He wants rest. I\u0027ve been uneasy about him a long while. What\u0027s the[Pg 68] doctor\u0027s number in Harley Street, Mr. Brownlow?\" \"110A,\" said Brownlow, picking the number out of his marvellous memory; \"but don\u0027t let Mr. Pettigrew know I told you. He\u0027s very touchy about himself.\" \"I won\u0027t.\" Off he went. \"Faithful old servitor,\" thought Brownlow. The faithful old servitor got into a taxi. \"110A, Harley Street,\" said he to the driver; \"and drive quick and I\u0027ll give you an extra tuppence.\" Oppenshaw was in. When he was informed that Pettigrew\u0027s servant had called to see him, he turned over a duchess he was engaged on, gave her a harmless prescription, bowed her out and rang the bell. Mudd was shown in. \"I\u0027ve come to ask——\" said Mudd. \"Sit down,\" said Oppenshaw. \"I\u0027ve come to speak——\" \"I know; about your master. How is he?\" \"Well, I\u0027ve come to ask you, sir; he\u0027s at the Charing Cross Hotel at present.\" \"Has he gone there to live?\" \"Well, he\u0027s there.\" \"I saw him some time ago about the state of[Pg 69] his health, and, frankly, Mr. Mudd, it\u0027s serious.\" Mudd nodded. \"Tell me,\" said Oppenshaw, \"has he been buying new clothes?\" \"Heaps; no end,\" said Mudd. \"And such clothes—things he\u0027s never worn before.\" \"So? Well, it\u0027s fortunate you found him. What is his conversation like? Have you talked to him much?\" \"I haven\u0027t seen him yet,\" Mudd explained. \"Well, stay close to him, and be very careful. He is suffering from a form of mental upset. You must cross him as little as possible, use persuasion, gentle persuasion. The thing will run its course. It mustn\u0027t be suddenly checked.\" \"Is he mad?\" asked the other. \"No, but he is not himself—or rather, he is himself—in a different way; but a sudden check might make him mad. You have heard of people walking in their sleep—well, this is something akin to that. You know it is highly dangerous to awaken a sleep-walker suddenly. Well, it\u0027s just the same with Mr. Pettigrew; it might imbalance his mind for good.\" \"What am I to do?\" \"Just keep watch on him.\" \"But suppose he don\u0027t know me?\" \"He won\u0027t know you, but if you are kind to him he will accept you into his environment, and then you will link on to his mental state.\" \"He\u0027s out now, and God knows where, or doing what,\" said Mudd; \"but I\u0027ll be on the watch for him coming in—if he ever comes.\" \"Oh, he will come home right enough.\" \"Is there any fear of those women getting hold of him?\" asked Mudd, returning to his old dread. \"That\u0027s just what there is—every fear; but you must be very careful not to interpose your will violently. Get gently between, gently between. You understand me. Suggestion does a lot in these cases. Another thing, you must treat him as one treats a boy. You must imagine to yourself that your master is only twenty, for that, in truth, is what he is. He has gone back to a younger state—or rather, a younger state has come to meet him, having lain dormant, just as a wisdom tooth lies dormant, then grows.\" \"Oh, Lord!\" said Mudd. \"I never did think I\u0027d live to see this day.\" \"Oh, it might be worse.\" \"I don\u0027t see.\" \"Well, from what I can make out of his youth, it was not a vicious one, only foolish;[Pg 71] had he been vicious when young he might be terrible now.\" \"The first solicitor in London,\" said Mudd in a dreary voice. \"Well, he\u0027s not the first solicitor in London to make a fool of himself, nor will he be the last. Cheer up and keep your eyes open and do your duty; no man can do more than that.\" \"Shall I send for you, doctor, if he gets worse?\" \"Well,\" said Oppenshaw; \"from what you tell me he couldn\u0027t be much worse. Oh no, don\u0027t bother to send—unless, of course, the thing took a different course, and he were to become violent without reason; but that won\u0027t happen, you can take my word for it.\" Mudd departed. He walked all the way back to the Charing Cross Hotel, but instead of entering, he suddenly took a taxi, and returned to Charles Street. Here he packed some things in a handbag, and having again given directions to Mrs. Jukes to lock up the plate, he told her he might be some time gone. \"I\u0027m going with the master on some law business,\" said Mudd. \"Make sure and bolt the front door—and lock up the plate.\" It was the third or fourth time he had given her these instructions. \"He\u0027s out of his mind,\" said Mrs. Jukes, as she watched him go. She wasn\u0027t far wrong. Mudd had been used to a rut—a rut forty years deep. His light and pleasant duties carried him easily through the day. Of evenings when Simon was dining out he would join a social circle in the private room of a highly respectable tavern close by, smoke his pipe, drink two hot gins, and depart for home at ten-thirty. When Simon was in he could smoke his pipe and read his paper in his own private room. He had five hundred pounds laid by in the bank—no stocks and shares for Mudd—and he would vary his evening amusements by counting the toll of his money. It is easy to be seen that this jolt out of the rut was, literally, a jolt. At the Charing Cross Hotel he found the room allotted to him, deposited his things and, disdaining the servants\u0027 quarters, went out to a tavern to read the paper. He reckoned Simon might not return till late, and he reckoned right.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1832/53110.html","bookId":24,"book":{"id":24,"title":"The Man Who Found Himself","description":"简介： King Charles Street lies in Westminster; you turn a corner and find yourself in Charles Street as one might turn a corner and find oneself in History.
