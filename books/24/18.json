{"id":691,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER VIII PALL MALL PLACE","content":"\"Higgs!\" cried the Hon. Richard Pugeot. \n \n \"Sir?\" answered a voice from behind the silk curtains cutting off the dressing and bathroom from the bedroom. \n \n \"What o\u0027clock is it?\" \n \n \"Just gone eight, sir.\" \n \n \"Get me some soda-water.\" \n \n \"Yes, sir.\" \n \n The Hon. Richard lay still. \n \n Higgs, a clean-shaven and smart-looking young man, appeared with a bottle of Schweppes and a tumbler on a salver. \n \n The cork popped and the sufferer drank. \n \n \"What o\u0027clock did I come home?\" \n \n \"After twelve, sir—pretty nigh one.\" \n \n \"Was there anyone with me?\" \n \n \"No, sir.\" \n \n \"No old gentleman?\" \n \n \"No, sir.\" \n \n \"Was Randall there?\" \n \n \"Yes, sir.\" \n \n \"And the car?\" \n \n \"Yes, sir.\" \n \n \"There was no old gentleman in the car?\" \n \n \"No, sir.\" \n \n \"Good heavens!\" said Pugeot. \"What can I have done with him?\" \n \n Higgs, not knowing, said nothing, moving about putting things in order and getting his master\u0027s bath ready. \n \n \"I\u0027ve lost an old gentleman, Higgs,\" said Pugeot, for Higgs was a confidential servant as well as a valet. \n \n \"Indeed, sir,\" said Higgs, as though losing old gentlemen was as common as losing umbrellas. \n \n \"And the whole business is so funny I can scarcely believe it\u0027s true. I haven\u0027t a touch of the jim-jams, have I, Higgs?\" \n \n \"Lord, sir, no! You\u0027re all right.\" \n \n \"Am I? See here, Higgs. Yesterday morning I met old Mr. Simon Pettigrew, the lawyer; mind, you are to say nothing about this to anyone—but stay a moment, go into the sitting-room and fetch me Who\u0027s Who.\" \n \n Higgs fetched the book. \n \n \"\u0027Pettigrew, Simon,\u0027\" read out Pugeot,[Pg 175] with the book resting on his knees, \"\u0027Justice of the Peace for Herts—President of the United Law Society—Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries\u0027—h\u0027m, h\u0027m—\u0027Club, Athen?um.\u0027 Well, I met the old gentleman in Piccadilly. We went for a spin together, and the last thing I remember was seeing him chasing a stableman round some inn yard, where we had stopped for petrol or whisky or something; chasing him round with a bucket. He was trying to put the bucket over the stableman\u0027s head.\" \n \n \"Fresh,\" said Higgs. \n \n \"As you say, fresh—but I want to know, was that an optical illusion? There were other things, too. If it wasn\u0027t an optical illusion I want to know what has become of the old gentleman? I\u0027m nervous—for he did me a good turn once, and I hope to heaven I haven\u0027t let him in for any bother.\" \n \n \"Well, sir,\" said Higgs, \"I wouldn\u0027t worry, not if I were you. It was only his little lark, and most likely he\u0027s home safe by this.\" \n \n \"I have also a recollection of two ladies that got mixed up in the affair,\" went on the other, \"but who they were I can\u0027t say. Little lark! The bother of it is, Higgs, one can\u0027t play little larks like that, safely, if one is a highly respectable person and a J.P. and[Pg 176] a member of the what\u0027s-its-name society.\" \n \n He got up and tubbed and dressed, greatly troubled in his mind. People sucked into the Simon-whirl were generally troubled in their minds, so great is the Power of High Respectability when linked to the follies of youth. \n \n At breakfast Mr. Robert Ravenshaw\u0027s card was presented by Higgs. \n \n \"Show him in,\" said Pugeot. \n \n \"Hullo, Ravenshaw!\" said Pugeot. \"Glad to see you. Have you had breakfast?\" \n \n \"Yes, thanks. I only called for a moment to see you about my uncle.\" \n \n \"Which uncle?\" \n \n \"Pettigrew——\" \n \n \"Good heavens! You don\u0027t say he\u0027s——\" \n \n Bobby explained. \n \n It was like a millstone removed from Pugeot\u0027s neck. \n \n Then he, in his turn, explained. \n \n Then Bobby went into details. \n \n Then they consulted. \n \n \"You can\u0027t get him out of London without telling him where you are taking him to,\" said Pugeot. \"He\u0027ll kick the car over on the road if he\u0027s anything like what he was last night. Leave it to me and I\u0027ll do the trick. But the question is, where shall we take him? There\u0027s[Pg 177] no use going to a place like Brighton; too many attractions for him. A moated grange is what he wants, and even then he\u0027ll be tumbling into the moat.\" \n \n \"I know of a place,\" said Bobby, \"down at Upton-on-Hill. A girl told me of it; it\u0027s the Rose Hotel.\" \n \n \"I know it,\" said Pugeot; \"couldn\u0027t be better. I have a cousin there living at a place called The Nook. There\u0027s a bowling-green at the hotel and a golf-course near. Can\u0027t hurt himself. Leave it all to me.\" \n \n He told Higgs to telephone for the car, and then they sat and smoked whilst Pugeot showed Bobby just the way to deal with people of Uncle Simon\u0027s description. \n \n \"It\u0027s all nonsense, that doctor man\u0027s talk,\" said Pugeot. \"The poor old chap has shed a nut or two. I ought to know something about it for I\u0027ve had the same bother in my family. Got his youth back—pish! Cracked, that\u0027s the real name for it. I\u0027ve seen it. I\u0027ve seen my own uncle, when he was seventy, get his youth back—and the last time I saw him he was pulling a toy elephant along with a string. He\u0027d got a taste also for playing with matches. Is that the car, Higgs? Well, come along, and let\u0027s try the power of a little gentle persuasion.\" \n \n Simon was finishing breakfast when they arrived, assisted by Madame and Cerise. Poor Monsieur Pattigrew did not seem in the least in the need of pity either, though the women hung about him as women hang about an invalid. He was talking and laughing, and he greeted the newcomers as good companions who had just turned up. His geniality was not to be denied, and it struck Bobby, in a weird sort of manner, that Uncle Simon like this was a much pleasanter person than the old original article. Like this: that is to say, for a moment out of danger from the vicious grinding wheels of a city that destroys butterflies and a society that requests respectable old solicitors to remain respectable old solicitors. \n \n Then, the women having discreetly retired for a while, Pugeot began his gentle persuasion. \n \n Uncle Simon, with visions of yesterday\u0027s rural pleasures in his mind, required no persuasion, and he would come for a run into the country with pleasure; but Pugeot was not taking that sort of thing on any more. He was gay, but a very little of that sort of gaiety sufficed him for a long time. \n \n \"I don\u0027t mean that,\" said he; \"I mean let\u0027s go down and stay for a while quietly at some nice place—I mean you and Ravenshaw[Pg 179] here—for business will oblige me to come back to town.\" \n \n \"No, thanks,\" said Simon; \"I\u0027m quite happy in London.\" \n \n \"But think how nice it will be in the country this weather,\" said Bobby. \"London\u0027s so hot.\" \n \n \"I like it hot,\" said Simon; \"weather can\u0027t be too hot for me.\" \n \n Then the gentle persuaders alternately began offering inducements—bowls, golf, a jolly bar at an hotel they knew, even girls. \n \n They might just as well have been offering buns to the lions of Trafalgar Square. \n \n Then Bobby had an idea, and, leaving the room, he had a conference on the stairs with Madame Rossignol; with Cerise also. \n \n Then leaving Simon to the women for a while, they went for a walk, and returned to find the marble wax. \n \n Simon did not mind a few days in the country if the ladies would come as his guests; he was enthusiastic on the subject now. They would all go and have a jolly time in the country. The old poetical instinct that had not shown itself up to this, restrained, no doubt, by the mesmerism of London, seemed to be awakening and promising new developments. \n \n Bobby did not care; poetry or a Pickford\u0027s[Pg 180] van were all the same to him as long as they got Simon out of London. \n \n He had promised Julia Delyse, if you remember, to see her that day, but he had quite forgotten her for the moment. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1832/53119.html","bookId":24,"book":{"id":24,"title":"The Man Who Found Himself","description":"简介： King Charles Street lies in Westminster; you turn a corner and find yourself in Charles Street as one might turn a corner and find oneself in History.
