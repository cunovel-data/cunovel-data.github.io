{"id":684,"no":11,"title":"PART III CHAPTER I THE LAST SOVEREIGN","content":"On the morning of the fourth of June, the same morning on which Simon had broken like a butterfly from his chrysalis of long-moulded custom and stiff routine, Mr. Bobby Ravenshaw, nephew and only near relation of Simon Pettigrew, awoke in his chambers in Pactolus Mansions, Piccadilly, yawned, rang for his tea, and, picking up the book he had put beside him on dropping to sleep, began to read. The book was Monte Cristo. Now Pactolus Mansions, Piccadilly, sounds a very grand address, and, as a matter of fact, it is a grand address, but the address is grander than the place. For one thing, it is not in Piccadilly, the approach is up a dubious side street; the word \"Pactolus\" bears little relationship to it, nor the word \"Mansions,\" and the rents are moderate. Downstairs there is a restaurant and a lounge with cosy corners. People take chambers in Pactolus Mansions and vanish. The fact is never reported to the Society for Psychical Research, the levitation being always accountable for by solid reasons. To stop them from vanishing before their rent is paid they have to pay their rent in advance. No credit is given under any circumstances. This seems hard, yet there are the compensating advantages that the rent is low, the service good, and the address taking. Bobby Ravenshaw had chosen to live in Pactolus Mansions because it was the cheapest place he could get near the gayest place in town. Bobby was an orphan, an Oxford man without a degree, and with a taste for literature and fine clothes. Absolutely irresponsible. Five hundred a year, derived from Simon, of whose only sister he was the son, and an instinct for bridge that was worth another two hundred and fifty supported Bobby in a lame sort of way, assisted by friends, confiding tailors and bootmakers, and a genial moneylender who was also a cigar merchant. Bobby had started in life a year or two ago with cleverness of no mean order and the backing of money, but Fate had dealt him out two bad cards: a nature that was charming and irresponsible, and good looks. Girls [Pg 89]worshipped Bobby, and if his talents had only cast him on the stage their worship might have helped. As it was, it hindered, for Bobby was a literary man, and no girl has ever bought a book on the strength of the good looks of the author. His tea having arrived, Bobby drank it, finished the chapter in Monte Cristo and then rose and dressed. He was leaving Pactolus Mansions that day for the very good reason that, if he wished to stay beyond twelve o\u0027clock, he would have to pay a month\u0027s rent in advance, and he only had thirty shillings. Uncle Simon had \"foreclosed.\" That was Bobby\u0027s expression, a month ago. For a month Bobby had watched the sands running down; no more money to come in and all the time money running out. Absolutely unalarmed, and only noticing the fact as he might have noticed a change in the weather, he had made no provision, trusting to chance, to bridge that betrayed him, and to friends. Literature could not help. He had got into a wrong groove as far as moneymaking went. Little articles for literary papers of limited circulation and a really cultivated taste are not the immediate means to financial support in a world that devours its fictional literature like ham sandwiches, forgotten[Pg 90] as soon as eaten—and only fictional literature pays. He was thinking more of Monte Cristo than of his own position as he dressed. The fact that he had to look out for other rooms worried him as an uncomfortable business to be performed, but not much. If he couldn\u0027t get other rooms that day he could always stay with Tozer. Tozer was an Oxford man with chambers in the Albany—chambers always open to Bobby at any hour. A sure stand-by in trouble. Then, having dressed, he took his hat and stick and the sovereign and half-sovereign lying on the mantel, tipped the servant the half-sovereign, and ordered that his things should be packed and his luggage taken to the office to be left till he called for it. \"I\u0027m going to the country,\" said Bobby, \"and I\u0027ll send my address for letters to be forwarded.\" Then he started. He called first at the Albany. Tozer, the son of a big, defunct Manchester cotton merchant, was a man of some twenty-three years, red-haired, with a taste for the good things of life, a taste for boxing, a taste for music, and a hard common sense that never deserted him even in his gayest and most [Pg 91]frivolous moods. His chambers were newly furnished, the walls of the sitting-room adorned with old prints, mostly proofs before letter; boxing gloves and single-sticks hinted of themselves, and a violoncello stood in the corner. He was at breakfast when Bobby arrived. Tozer rang for another cup and plate. \"Tozer,\" said Bobby, \"I\u0027m bust.\" \"Aren\u0027t surprised to hear it,\" replied Tozer. \"Try these kippers.\" \"One single sovereign in the world, my boy, and I\u0027m hunting for new rooms.\" \"What\u0027s the matter with your old rooms? Have they kicked you out?\" Bobby explained. \"Good Lord!\" said Tozer. \"You\u0027ve cut the ground from under your feet, staying at a place like that.\" \"It\u0027s not all my fault, it\u0027s my relative. I always boasted to him that I paid my rent in advance; he took it as a sign of wisdom.\" \"What made him go back on you?\" \"A girl.\" \"Which way?\" \"Well, it was this way. I was staying with the Huntingdons, you know, the Warwickshire lot.\" \"I know—bridge and brandy crowd.\" \"Oh, they\u0027re all right. Well, I was staying with them when I met her.\" \"What\u0027s her name?\" \"Alice Carruthers.\" \"Heave ahead.\" \"I got engaged to her; she hadn\u0027t a penny.\" \"Just like you.\" \"And her people haven\u0027t a penny, and I wrote like a fool telling the relative. He gave me the option of cutting her off or being cut off. It seems her people were the real obstacle. He wrote quite libellous things about them. I refused.\" \"Of course.\" \"And he cut me off. Well, the funny thing was she cut me off a week later, and she\u0027s engaged now to a chap called Harkness.\" \"Well, why don\u0027t you tell the relative and make it up?\" \"Tell him she\u0027d fired me! Besides, it\u0027s no use, he\u0027d just go on to other things—what he calls extravagances and irresponsibilities.\" \"I see.\" \"That\u0027s just how it is.\" \"Look here, Bobby,\" said Tozer, \"you\u0027ve just got to cut all this nonsense and get to work. You\u0027ve been making a fool of yourself.\" \"I have,\" said Bobby, helping himself to marmalade. \"There\u0027s no use saying, \u0027I have,\u0027 and then forgetting. I know you. You\u0027re a good sort, Bobby, but you are in the wrong set; you couldn\u0027t keep the pace. You\u0027ve loads of cleverness and you\u0027re going to rot. Work!\" \"How?\" \"Write,\" said Tozer, who believed in Bobby and hated to see him going to waste. \"Write. I\u0027ve always been urging you to settle down and write.\" \"I made five pounds ten last year writing,\" said Bobby. \"I know—articles on old French poetry and so on. You\u0027ve got to write fiction. You can do it. That little story you wrote for Tillson\u0027s was ripping.\" \"The devil of it is,\" said Bobby, \"I can\u0027t find plots. I can write all right if I have only something to write about, but I can\u0027t find plots.\" \"That\u0027s rubbish, and pure laziness. Can\u0027t find plots, with your experience of London and life! You\u0027ve got to find plots, and find them sharp; it\u0027s the only trade open to you. You can do it, and it pays. Now look here, B. R. I\u0027ll finance you——\" \"Thanks awfully,\" said Bobby, helping himself to a cigarette from a box on a little table near by. \"Reserve your thanks. I\u0027m not going to finance a slacker, which you are at present, but a hard-working literary man, which you will be when I have done with you. I will give you a room here on the strict conditions that you keep early hours five days a week.\" \"Yes.\" \"That you give up bridge.\" \"Yes.\" \"And fooling after girls.\" \"Yes.\" \"And this day set out and find a plot for a good, honest, payable piece of fiction, novel length. I\u0027m not going to let you off with short-story writing.\" \"Yes.\" \"I know a good publisher, and I will assure you that the thing shall be published in the best form, that I will back the advertising and pushing—see? And I will promise you that, however the thing turns out, you shall have two hundred pounds. You will get all profits if it is a success, understand me?\" \"Yes.\" \"You shall have five pounds a week pocket-money whilst you are writing, to be repaid out of profits if the profits exceed two hundred, not to be repaid if they don\u0027t.\" \"I don\u0027t like taking money for nothing,\" said Bobby. \"You won\u0027t get it, only for hard work. Besides, it\u0027s for my amusement and interest. I believe in you, and I want to see my belief justified. You need never bother about taking money from me. First, I have plenty; secondly, I never give it without a quid pro quo, the trading instinct is too strong in me.\" \"Well,\" said Bobby, \"it\u0027s jolly good of you, and I\u0027ll pay you the lot back, if——\" Tozer was lighting a cigarette; he flung the match down impatiently. \"If! You\u0027ll do nothing if you begin with an \u0027if.\u0027 Now, make up your mind quick without any \u0027ifs.\u0027 Will you, or won\u0027t you?\" \"I will,\" said Bobby, suddenly catching on to the idea and taking fire. \"I believe I can do it if——\" \"If!\" shouted Tozer. \"I will do it. I\u0027ll find a plot. I\u0027ll dig in my brains right away—I\u0027ll hunt round.\" \"Off with you, then,\" said Tozer, \"and send your luggage here and come back to-night with your plot. You can work in your bedroom and you can have all your meals here—I forgot to include that. Now I\u0027m going to have a tune on the \u0027cello.\" Bobby departed with a light heart. His position, before calling on Tozer, had really begun to weigh on him. Tozer had given him even more than the promise of financial support, he had given him the backing of his common sense. He had \"jawed\" him mildly, and Bobby felt all the better for it. It was like a tonic. His high spirits as he descended the stairs increased with every step taken. Bobby was no sponge. Bridge and the relative had kept him going, and he had always managed to meet his debts, with the exception, perhaps, of a tradesman or two; nor would he have taken this favour from any other man than Tozer, and perhaps not even from Tozer had it not been accompanied by the \"jawing.\" So he set out, light of heart, young, good-looking, well-dressed, yet with only a sovereign, to hunt through the summer landscape of London for the plot for a novel. Why, he was the plot for a novel, or at least the beginning of one, had he known! He did not, but he had an intimate knowledge of Tozer\u0027s fictional proclivities and a fine understanding of exactly what Tozer wanted. Bones, ribs, and vertebra, construction—or, in other words, story. Tozer could not be fubbed[Pg 97] off with fine writing, with long introspective chapters dealing with the boyhood of the author, with sham psychology masquerading as Fiction; nor, indeed, could Bobby have supplied the two latter features. Tozer wanted action, people moving on their feet under the dominion of the author\u0027s purpose, through situations, towards a definite goal. Out in Vigo Street, and despite the aura of inspiration around the Bodley Head, Bobby\u0027s high spirits came slightly under eclipse; it all at once seemed to him that he had undertaken a task. In Cork Street, as he stood for a moment looking at the rare editions exposed in the windows of Elkin Mathews, this feeling grew and put on horns. A task to Bobby meant a thing disagreeable to do, and the elegant volumes of minor poets, copies of the Yellow Book, and vellum-bound editions of belles lettres were saying to him, \"You\u0027ve got to write a novel, my boy, a good Mudie novel, the sort of novel the Tozers of life will pay for; no little essays written with the little finger turned up. No modern verses like your \u0027Harmonies and Discords,\u0027 that cost you twenty-five pounds to produce and sold sixteen copies of itself, according to last returns. You have got to be the harmonious blacksmith now;[Pg 98] get into your apron, get under your spreading chestnut-tree, and produce.\" In Bond Street he met Lord Billy Tottenham, a fellow Oxonian, who met his death in a mud-hole in Flanders the other year. Lord Billy, with a boyish, smug, but immovable face adorned with a tortoiseshell-rimmed eyeglass. \"Hello, Bobby!\" said Billy. \"Hello, Billy!\" said Bobby. \"What\u0027s wrong with you?\" asked Billy. \"Broke to the world, my dear chap.\" \"What was the horse?\" asked Billy. \"\u0027Twasn\u0027t a horse—a girl, mostly.\" \"Well, you\u0027re not the first chap that\u0027s been broke by a girl,\" said Billy. \"Walk along a bit—but it might have been worse.\" \"How so?\" \"She might have married you.\" \"Maybe; but the worst of it is I\u0027ve got to work—tuck up my sleeves and work.\" \"What at?\" \"Novel-writing.\" \"Well, that\u0027s easy enough,\" said Billy cheerfully. \"You can easily get some literary cove to do the writing and stick your name to it, and we\u0027ll all buy your books, my boy, we\u0027ll all buy your books; not that I ever read books much,[Pg 99] but I\u0027ll buy \u0027em if you write \u0027em. Come into Jubber\u0027s.\" Arm-in-arm they entered Long\u0027s Hotel, where Billy resided, and over a mutual whisky-and-soda they forgot books and discussed horses; they lunched together and discussed dogs, girls, and mutual friends. It was like old times again, but over the liqueurs and over the cigarette-smoke suddenly appeared to Bobby the vision of Tozer. He said good-bye to the affluent one, and departed. \"I\u0027ve got to work,\" said Bobby. His momentary lapse from the direction of the target only served to pull him together, and it seemed, now, as though the luncheon and the lapse had made things easier. He told himself if he hadn\u0027t brains enough to scare up some sort of plot for a six-shilling novel he had better drown himself. If he couldn\u0027t do what hundreds of people with half his knowledge of the world and ability were doing he would be a mug of the very first water. If anything depressed him it was the horrible and futile assurance of Billy that \"his friends would buy his books.\" He went to Pactolus Mansions and ordered his luggage to be sent to the Albany, then he changed his sovereign and bought a cigar, then an omnibus gave him an[Pg 100] inspiration. He would get on top of an omnibus and in that cool and airy position do a bit of thinking. It was not an original idea; he had read, or heard, of a famous author who thought out his plots on the tops of omnibuses—but it was an idea. He clambered on to the top of an eastward-going bus, and, behind a fat lady with bugles on her bonnet, tried to compose his mind. Why not make a story about—Billy? People liked reading of the aristocracy, and Billy was a character in his way and had many stories attached to him. He could start the book grandly, simply out of remembered visions of Lord William Tottenham in his gayest moods. L. W. T. emptying bottles of cliquot into a grand piano at Oxford. Oxford—ay, grander and grander—the book should begin at Oxford with a fresh and vigorous picture of University life. Tozer would come in, and a host of others; then, after Oxford, there was the rub. The story that had begun so brightly suddenly ceased. A character and a situation do not make a story. They had reached the Bank—as if by derision, when he told himself this. He got off the omnibus and got on a westward-bound one [Pg 101]harking back to the land he knew. He remembered the expression, \"racking one\u0027s brains to find a plot.\" He knew the meaning of it now. At Piccadilly Circus, where all the things meet, a lanky, wild-looking, red-haired girl in a picture hat and a fit of abstraction—that was the impression she gave—caught his eye. In a moment he was after her. Here was salvation. Julia Delyse, the last catch-on, whose books were selling by the hundred thousand. He had met her at the Three Arts Ball and once since. She had called him Bobby the second time. He had flirted with her, as he flirted with everything with skirts on, and forgotten her. She was very modern; modern enough to raise the hair on a grandmother\u0027s scalp. Her looks were to match. \"Hello,\" said he. \"Hello, Bobby,\" said Julia. \"You are just the person I want to see,\" said Bobby. \"How\u0027s that?\" said Julia. \"I\u0027m in a fix.\" \"What sort of fix?\" \"I\u0027ve got to write a novel.\" \"What\u0027s the hurry?\" asked Julia. \"Money,\" said Bobby. \"Make money?\" \"Yes.\" \"If you write for money you\u0027re lost,\" said Julia. \"I\u0027m lost anyway,\" replied Bobby. \"Where are you going to?\" \"Home; my flat\u0027s close by. Come and have some tea.\" \"I don\u0027t mind. Well now, see here; I\u0027ve got to do it and I can\u0027t find anything to write about.\" \"With all London before you?\" \"I know, but when I start to think it all gets behind me. I want you to start me with some idea; you\u0027re full of ideas and you know the ropes.\" They had reached the flat, and the lady with ideas ushered him in. The sitting-room was in a scheme of black with Japanese effects; she offered cigarettes, lit one herself, and tea was brought in. Then the hypnotism began. The fact that she was a \"famous authoress\" would not have mattered a button to Bobby yesterday; to-day, on his new strange road, it lent her a charm that completed the fascination of her wondrous eyes. They seemed wild in the street, but when she looked at one intensively they were wonderful. Plots were forgotten, and[Pg 103] in the twilight Bobby\u0027s full, musical voice might have been heard discussing literature—with long pauses. \"Dear old thing.... Is that cushion comfy?... Oh, bother the girl and the tea-things!... Just put your head so—so....\" He had been hooked twenty times by girls and pulled off the hook by parents or been thrown back by the fisherwoman on inspecting his bank balance, but he had never been hooked like this before, for Julia had no parents to speak of; she was above bank balances, and her grip was of iron where passion was concerned, and publishers. Her publishers could have told you that by the way she gripped her rights when they tried to cheat her of them, for, despite her wondrous eyes and wild air and the fact that she was a genius, she was practical as well as tenacious in hold. Then, at the end of the séance, Bobby found himself leaving the flat a semi-tied-up man. He couldn\u0027t remember whether he had proposed to her or she to him, or whether either of them had proposed or actually accepted, but there was a tie between them, a tie slight enough and not binding in any court; less an engagement than an attachment formed, so he told himself. He remembered in the street, however, that a[Pg 104] tie between him and an authoress was not what Tozer wanted; he had received no plot or even literary hint. Had he retained his clear senses during the séance, and had he possessed a knowledge of Julia Delyse\u0027s brilliant and cynical books, he might have wondered where the brilliancy and cynicism came from. In love, Julia was absolutely unliterary—and a bit heavy—clinging, as it were. The momentary idea of running back to ask for the forgotten plot, as for a hat left behind, was dispelled by this sudden feeling that she was heavy. Under the fascination of her eyes and in that weird room she seemed light; in St. James\u0027s Street, where he now was, she seemed heavy. And he would have to go on with the attachment for awhile or be a brute. That recognition, with the remembrance of Tozer and a recognition of his failure in his search for the one essential thing, depressed him for a moment. Then he determined to forget about everything and go and have dinner. In other words, failing in his search for the thing he wanted, he stopped searching, leaving the matter in the hands of blind chance.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1832/53112.html","bookId":24,"book":{"id":24,"title":"The Man Who Found Himself","description":"简介： King Charles Street lies in Westminster; you turn a corner and find yourself in Charles Street as one might turn a corner and find oneself in History.
