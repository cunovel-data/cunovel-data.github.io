{"id":687,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER IV THE HUNDRED-POUND NOTE—continued","content":"Mudd departed and Bobby made for the coffee-room. He entered and looked around. A good many people were breakfasting in the big room, the ordinary English breakfast crowd at a big hotel; family parties, lone men and lone women, some reading letters, some papers, and all, somehow, with an air of divorcement from home. Simon was there, seated at a little table on the right and enjoying himself. Now, and in his right mind, Simon gave Bobby another shock. Could it be possible that this pleasant-faced, jovial-looking gentleman, so well-dressed and à la mode, was Uncle Simon? What an improvement! So it seemed at first glance. Simon looked up from his sausages—he was having sausages, saw Bobby—and with his unfailing memory of pleasant things, even dimly seen, recognised him as the man of last night. \"Hullo,\" said Simon, as the other came up to[Pg 130] the table, \"there you are again. Had breakfast?\" \"No,\" said Bobby. \"I\u0027ll sit here if I may.\" He drew a chair to the second place that was laid and took his seat. \"Have sausages,\" said Simon. \"Nothing beats sausages.\" Bobby ordered sausages, though he would have preferred anything else. He didn\u0027t want to argue. \"Nothing beats sausages,\" said Uncle Simon again. Bobby concurred. Then the conversation languished, just as it may between two old friends or boon companions who have no need to keep up talk. \"Feeling all right this morning?\" ventured Bobby. \"Never felt better in my life,\" replied the other. \"Never felt better in my life. How did you manage to get home?\" \"Oh, I got home all right.\" Simon scarcely seemed to hear this comforting declaration; scrambled eggs had been placed before him. Bobby, in sudden contemplation of a month of this business, almost forgot his sausages. The true horror of Uncle Simon appeared to[Pg 131] him now for the first time. You see, he knew all the facts of the case. An ordinary person, unknowing, would have accepted Simon as all right, but it seemed to Bobby, now, that it would have been much better if his companion had been decently and honestly mad, less uncanny. He was obviously sane, though a bit divorced from things; obviously sane, and eating scrambled eggs after sausages with the abandon of a schoolboy on a holiday after a long term at a cheap school; sane, and enjoying himself after a night like that—yet he was Simon Pettigrew. Then he noticed that Simon\u0027s eyes were constantly travelling, despite the scrambled eggs, in a given direction. A pretty young girl was breakfasting with a family party a little way off—that was the direction. There was a mother, a father, something that looked like an uncle, what appeared to be an aunt, and what appeared to be May dressed in a washing silk blouse and plain skirt. November was glancing at May. Bobby remembered Miss Rossignol and felt a bit comforted; then he began to feel uncomfortable: the aunt was looking fixedly at Simon. His admiration had evidently been noted by Watchfulness; then the uncle seemed to take notice. Bobby, blushing, tried to make conversation, and only got replies. Then, to his relief, the family, having finished breakfast, withdrew, and Simon became himself again, cheerful and burning for the pleasures of the day before him, the pleasures to be got from London, money, and youth. His conversation told this, and that he desired to include Bobby in the scheme of things, and the young man could not help remembering Thackeray\u0027s little story of how, coming up to London, he met a young Oxford man in the railway carriage, a young man half-tipsy with the prospect of a day in town and a \"tear round\"—with the prospect, nothing more. \"What are you going to do now?\" asked Bobby, as the other rose from the table. \"Shaved,\" said Simon; \"come along and get shaved; can\u0027t go about like this.\" Bobby was already shaved, but he followed the other outside to a barber\u0027s and sat reading a Daily Mirror and waiting whilst Simon was operated on. The latter, having been shaved, had his hair brushed and trimmed, and all the time during these processes the barber spake in this wise, Simon turning the monologue to a duologue. \"Yes, sir, glorious weather, isn\u0027t it? [Pg 133]London\u0027s pretty full, too, for the time of year—fuller than I\u0027ve seen for a long time. Ever tried face massage, sir? Most comforting. Can be applied by yourself. Can sell you a complete outfit, Parker\u0027s face cream and all, two pound ten. Thank you, sir. Staying in the Charing Cross \u0027Otel? I\u0027ll have it sent to your room. Yes, sir, the \u0027otel is full. There\u0027s a deal of money being spent in London, sir. Raise your chin, sir, a leetle more. Ever try a Gillette razor, sir? Useful should you wish to shave in a \u0027urry; beautiful plated. This is it, sir—one guinea—shines like silver, don\u0027t it? Thank you, sir, I\u0027ll send it up with the other. Yes, sir, it\u0027s most convenient havin\u0027 a barber\u0027s close to the \u0027otel. I supply most of the \u0027otel people with toilet rekisites. \u0027Air\u0027s a little thin on the top, sir; didn\u0027t mean no offence, sir, maybe it\u0027s the light. Dry, that\u0027s what it is; it\u0027s the \u0027ot weather. Now, I\u0027d recommend Coolers\u0027 Lotion followed after application by Goulard\u0027s Brillantine. Oh, Lord, no, sir! Them brillantines is no use. Goulard\u0027s is the only real; costs a bit more, but then, cheap brillantine is rewin. Thank you, sir. And how are you off for \u0027air brushes, sir? There\u0027s a pair of bargains in that show-case—travellers\u0027 samples—I can let you have, silver-plated, as good as you\u0027ll get in London and \u0027arf[Pg 134] the price. Shine, don\u0027t they? And feel the bristles—real \u0027og. Thank you, sir. Two ten—one one—one four—two ten—and a shillin\u0027 for the \u0027air cut and shave. No, sir, I can\u0027t change an \u0027undred-pound note. A ten? Yes, I can manage a ten. Thank you, sir.\" Seven pounds and sixpence for a hair-cut and shave—with accompaniments. Bobby, tongue-tied and aghast, rose up. \"\u0027Air cut, sir?\" asked the barber. \"No, thanks,\" replied Bobby. Simon, having glanced at himself in the mirror, picked up his straw hat and walking-stick, and taking the arm of his companion, out they walked. \"Where are you going?\" asked Bobby. \"Anywhere,\" replied the other; \"I want to get some change.\" \"Why, you\u0027ve got change!\" Simon unlinked, and in the face of the Strand and the passers-by produced from his pocket two hundred-pound notes, three or four one-pound notes, and a ten-pound note; searching in his pockets to see what gold he had, he dropped a hundred-pound note, which Bobby quickly recovered. \"Mind!\" said Bobby. \"You\u0027ll have those notes snatched.\" \"That\u0027s all right,\" said Simon. He replaced the money in his pocket, and his companion breathed again. Bobby had borrowed five pounds from Tozer in view of possibilities. \"Look here,\" said he, \"what\u0027s the good of staying in London a glorious day like this? Let\u0027s go somewhere quiet and enjoy ourselves—Richmond or Greenwich or somewhere. I\u0027ll pay expenses and you need not bother about change.\" \"No, you won\u0027t,\" said Simon. \"You\u0027re going to have some fun along with me. What\u0027s the matter with London?\" Bobby couldn\u0027t say. Renouncing the idea of the country, without any other idea to replace it except to keep his companion walking and away from shops and bars and girls, he let himself be led. They were making back towards Charing Cross. At the Bureau de Change Simon went in, the idea of changing a hundred-pound note pursuing him. He wanted elbow-room for enjoyment, but the Bureau refused to make change. The note was all right; perhaps it was Simon that was the doubtful quantity. He had quite a little quarrel over the matter and came out arm-in-arm with his companion and flushed. \"Come along,\" said Bobby, a new idea striking him. \"We\u0027ll get change somewhere.\" From Charing Cross, through Cockspur Street, then through Pall Mall and up St. James\u0027s Street they went, stopping at every likely and unlikely place to find change. Engaged so, Simon at least was not spending money or taking refreshment. They tried at shipping offices, at insurance offices, at gun-shops and tailors, till the weary Bobby began to loathe the business, began to feel that both he and his companion were under suspicion and almost that the business they were on was doubtful. Simon, however, seemed to pursue it with zest and, now, without anger. It seemed to Bobby as though he enjoyed being refused, as it gave him another chance of entering another shop and showing that he had a hundred-pound note to change—a horrible foolish satisfaction that put a new edge to the affair. Simon was swanking. \"Look here,\", said the unfortunate, at last, \"wasn\u0027t there a girl you told me of last night you wanted to send flowers to? Let\u0027s go and get them; then we can have a drink somewhere.\" \"She\u0027ll wait,\" said Simon. \"Besides, I\u0027ve sent them. Come on.\" \"Very well,\" said Bobby, in desperation. \"I[Pg 137] believe I know a place where you can get your note changed; it\u0027s close by.\" They reached a cigar merchant\u0027s. It was the cigar merchants and moneylenders that had often stood him in good stead. \"Wait for me,\" said Bobby, and he went in. Behind the counter was a gentleman recalling Prince Florizel of Bohemia. \"Good morning, Mr. Ravenshaw,\" said this individual. \"Good morning, Alvarez,\" replied Bobby. \"I haven\u0027t called about that little account I owe you though—but cheer up. I\u0027ve got you a new customer—he wants a note changed.\" \"What sort of note?\" asked Alvarez. \"A hundred-pound note; can you do it?\" \"If the note\u0027s all right.\" \"Lord bless me, yes! I can vouch for that and for him; only he\u0027s strange to London. He\u0027s got heaps of money, too, but you must promise not to rook him too much over cigars, for he\u0027s a relative of mine.\" \"Where is he?\" asked Alvarez. \"Outside.\" \"Well, bring him in.\" Bobby went out. Uncle Simon was gone. Gone as though he had never been, swallowed up in the passing crowd, fascinated away by[Pg 138] heaven knows what, and with all those bank-notes in his pocket. He might have got into a sudden taxi or boarded an omnibus, or vanished up Sackville Street or Albemarle Street; any passing fancy or sudden temptation would have been sufficient. Bobby, hurrying towards St. James\u0027s Street to have a look down it, stopped a policeman. \"Have you seen an old gentleman—I mean a youngish-looking gentleman—in a straw hat?\" asked Bobby. \"I\u0027ve lost him.\" Scarcely waiting for the inevitable reply, he hurried on, feeling that the constable must have thought him mad. St. James\u0027s Street showed nothing of Simon. He was turning back when, half-blind to everything but the object of his search, he almost ran into the arms of Julia Delyse. She was carrying a parcel that looked like a manuscript. \"Why, Bobby, what is the matter with you?\" asked Julia. \"I\u0027m looking for someone,\" said Bobby distractedly. \"I\u0027ve lost a relative of mine.\" \"I wish it were one of mine,\" said Julia. \"What sort of relative?\" \"An oldish man in a straw hat. Walk down a bit; you look that side of the street and I\u0027ll[Pg 139] watch this; he may have gone into a shop—and I must get hold of him.\" He walked rapidly on, and Julia, sucked for a moment into this whirlpool of an Uncle Simon that had already engulfed Mudd, Bobby, and the good name of the firm of Pettigrew, toiled beside him till they came nearly to the Park railings. \"He\u0027s gone,\" said Bobby, stopping suddenly dead. \"It\u0027s no use; he\u0027s gone.\" \"Well, you\u0027ll find him again,\" said Julia hopefully. \"Relatives always turn up.\" \"Oh, he\u0027s sure to turn up,\" said the other, \"and that\u0027s what I\u0027m dreading—it\u0027s the way he\u0027ll turn up that\u0027s bothering me.\" \"I could understand you better if I knew what you meant,\" said Julia. \"Let\u0027s walk back; this is out of my direction.\" They turned. Despite his perplexity and annoyance, Bobby could not suppress a feeling of relief at having done with the business for a moment; all the same, he was really distressed. The craving for counsel and companionship in thought seized him. \"Julia, can you keep a secret?\" asked he. \"Tight,\" said Julia. \"Well, it\u0027s my uncle.\" \"You\u0027ve lost?\" \"Yes; and he\u0027s got his pockets full of hundred-pound bank-notes—and he\u0027s no more fit to be trusted with them than a child.\" \"What a delightful uncle!\" \"Don\u0027t laugh; it\u0027s serious.\" \"He\u0027s not mad, is he?\" \"No, that\u0027s the worst of it. He\u0027s got one of these beastly new diseases—I don\u0027t know what it is, but as far as I can make out it\u0027s as if he\u0027d got young again without remembering what he is.\" \"How interesting!\" \"Yes, you would find him very interesting if you had anything to do with him; but, seriously, something has to be done. There\u0027s the family name and there\u0027s his business.\" He explained the case of Simon as well as he could. Julia did not seem in the least shocked. \"But I think it\u0027s beautiful,\" she broke out. \"Strange—but in a way beautiful and pathetic. Oh, if only a few more people could do the same—become young, do foolish things instead of this eternal grind of common sense, hard business, and everything that ruins the world!\" Bobby tried to imagine the world with an increased population of the brand of Uncle Simon, and failed. \"I know,\" he said, \"but it will be the ruin of his business and reputation. Abstractly, I don\u0027t deny there\u0027s something to be said for it, but in the concrete it don\u0027t work. Do think, and let\u0027s try to find a way out.\" \"I\u0027m thinking,\" said Julia. Then, after a pause: \"You must get him away from London.\" \"That was my idea, but he won\u0027t go, not even to Richmond for a few hours. He won\u0027t leave London.\" \"There\u0027s a place in Wessex I know,\" said Julia, \"where there\u0027s a charming little hotel. I was down there for a week in May. You might take him there.\" \"We\u0027d never get him into the train.\" \"Take him in a car.\" \"Might do that,\" said Bobby. \"What\u0027s the name of it?\" \"Upton-on-Hill; and I\u0027ll tell you what, I\u0027ll go down with you, if you like, and help to watch him. I\u0027d like to study him.\" \"I\u0027ll think of it,\" said Bobby hurriedly. The affair of Uncle Simon was taking a new turn; like Fate, it was trying to force him into closer contact with Julia. Craving for someone to help him to think, he had welded himself to Julia with this family secret for solder. The[Pg 142] idea of a little hotel in the country with Julia, ever ready for embracements and passionate scenes, the knowledge that he was almost half-engaged to her, the instinct that she would suck him into cosy corners and arbours—all this frankly frightened him. He was beginning to recognise that Julia was quite light and almost brilliant in the street when love-making was impossible, but impossibly heavy and dull, though mesmeric, when alone with him with her head on his shoulder. And away in the distance of his mind a deformed sort of common sense was telling him that if once Julia got a good long clutch on him she would marry him; he would pass from whirlpool to whirlpool of cosy corner and arbour over the rapids of marriage with Julia clinging to him. \"I\u0027ll think of it,\" said he. \"What\u0027s its name?\" \"The Rose Hotel, Upton-on-Hill—think of Upton Sinclair. It\u0027s a jolly little place, and such a nice landlord; we\u0027d have a jolly time, Bobby. Bobby, have you forgotten yesterday?\" \"No,\" said Bobby, from his heart. \"I didn\u0027t sleep a wink last night,\" said the lady of the red hair. \"Did you?\" \"Scarcely.\" \"Do you know,\" said she, \"this is almost like[Pg 143] Fate. It gives us a chance to meet under the same roof quite properly since your uncle is there—not that I care a button for the world, but still, there are the proprieties, aren\u0027t there?\" \"There are.\" \"Wait for me,\" said she. \"I want to go into my publishers\u0027 with this manuscript.\" They had reached a fashionable publishers\u0027 office that had the appearance of a bank premises. In she went, returning in a moment empty-handed. \"Now I\u0027m free,\" said she; \"free for a month. What are you doing to-day?\" \"I\u0027ll be looking for Uncle Simon,\" he replied. \"I must rush back to the Charing Cross Hotel, and after that—I must go on hunting. I\u0027ll see you to-morrow, Julia.\" \"Are you staying at the Charing Cross?\" \"No, I\u0027m staying at B12, the Albany, with a man called Tozer.\" \"I wish we could have had the day together. Well, to-morrow, then.\" \"To-morrow,\" said Bobby. He put her into a taxi and she gave the address of a female literary club, then when the taxi had driven away he returned to the Charing Cross Hotel. There he found Mudd, who had just returned.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1832/53115.html","bookId":24,"book":{"id":24,"title":"The Man Who Found Himself","description":"简介： King Charles Street lies in Westminster; you turn a corner and find yourself in Charles Street as one might turn a corner and find oneself in History.
