{"id":699,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER VII TIDD versus BROWNLOW","content":"At four o\u0027clock that day a carriage drove up to the hotel and two gentlemen alighted. They were shown into the coffee-room and Mudd was sent for. He came, expecting to find police officers, and found Brownlow and Mr. Tidd. \"One moment, Mr. Tidd,\" said Brownlow, then he took Mudd outside into the hall. \"He\u0027s not fit to be seen,\" said Mudd, when the other had explained. \"No client must see him. He\u0027s right enough to look at and speak to, but he\u0027s not himself. What made you bring him here, Mr. Brownlow—now, of all times?\" Brownlow started and turned. Mr. Tidd had opened the coffee-room door, and how much of their conversation he had heard Heaven knows. \"One moment,\" said Brownlow. \"I will wait no longer,\" said Mr. Tidd. \"This must be explained. Is Mr. Pettigrew here or is he not? No, I will not wait.\" A waiter passed at that moment with an afternoon-tea-tray. \"Is Mr. Pettigrew in this hotel?\" asked Tidd. \"He\u0027s in the garden, I believe, sir.\" Brownlow tried to get in front of Tidd to round him off from the garden; Mudd tried to take his arm. He pushed them aside.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1832/53127.html","bookId":24,"book":{"id":24,"title":"The Man Who Found Himself","description":"简介： King Charles Street lies in Westminster; you turn a corner and find yourself in Charles Street as one might turn a corner and find oneself in History.
