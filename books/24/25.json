{"id":698,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER VI WHAT HAPPENED TO SIMON","content":"\"He came back two hours ago, sir, and he was in his room ten minutes ago—but he\u0027s gone.\" \"Well,\" said Bobby, who was just off to bed, \"he\u0027ll be back again soon; can\u0027t come to much harm here. You\u0027d better sit up for him, Mudd.\" Off he went to bed. He lay reading for awhile and thinking of Cerise; then he put out the light and dropped off to sleep. He was awakened by Mudd. Mudd with a candle in his hand. \"He\u0027s not back yet, Mr. Robert.\" Bobby sat up and rubbed his eyes. \"Not back? Oh, Uncle Simon! What\u0027s the time?\" \"Gone one, sir.\" \"Bother! What can have happened to him, Mudd?\" \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m asking myself,\" said Mudd. A heavy step sounded on the gravel drive in front of the hotel, then came a ring at the[Pg 235] bell. Mudd, candle in hand, darted off. Bobby heard voices down below. Five minutes passed and then reappeared Mudd—ghastly to look at. \"They\u0027ve took him,\" said Mudd. \"What?\" \"He\u0027s been took poachin\u0027.\" \"Poaching!\" \"Colonel Salmon\u0027s river, he and a man, and the man\u0027s got off. He\u0027s at the policeman\u0027s house, and he says he\u0027ll let us have him if we\u0027ll go bail for him, seeing he\u0027s an old gentleman and only did it for the lark of the thing.\" \"Thank God!\" \"But he\u0027ll have to go before the magistrates on We\u0027n\u0027sday, whether or no—before the magistrates—him!\" \"The devil!\" said Bobby. He got up and hurried on some clothes. \"Him before the magistrates—in his present state! Oh, Lord!\" \"Shut up!\" said Bobby. His hands were shaking as he put on his things. Pictures of Simon before the magistrates were fleeting before him. Money was the only chance. Could the policeman be bribed? Hurrying downstairs and outside into the moonlit night, he found the officer. None of[Pg 236] the hotel folk had turned out at the ring of the bell. Bobby, in a muted voice and beneath the stars, listened to the tale of the Law, then he tried corruption. Useless. Constable Copper, though he might be no more good than a blind horse, according to Horn, was incorruptible yet consolatory. \"It\u0027ll only be a couple of quid fine,\" said he. \"Maybe not that, seeing what he is and it was done for a lark. Horn will get it in the neck, but not him. He\u0027s at my house now, and you can have him back if you\u0027ll go bail he won\u0027t get loose again. He\u0027s a nice old gentleman, but a bit peculiar, I think.\" Constable Copper seemed quite light-hearted over the matter, and to think little of it as an offence. A couple of quid would cover it! He did not, perhaps, appreciate fully the light and shade of the situation—a J.P. and member of the Athen?um and of the Society of Antiquaries brought up for poaching in company with an evil character named Horn! Neither did Simon, whom they found seated on the side of the table in the Coppers\u0027 sitting-room talking to Mrs. Copper, who was wrapped in a shawl. He went back to the hotel with them rather silent but not depressed; he tried, indeed, to[Pg 237] talk and laugh over the affair. This was the last straw, and Bobby burst out, giving him a \"jawing\" complete and of the first pattern. Then they saw him to bed and put out the light. At breakfast he was quite himself again, and the summons which arrived at eleven o\u0027clock was not shown to him. No one knew of the affair with the exception of the whole village, all the hotel servants, Bobby and Mudd. The distracted Mudd spent the morning walking about, hither and thither, trying to collect his wits and make a plan. Simon had given his name, of course, though indeed it did not matter much as he was a resident at the hotel. It was impossible to deport him or move him or pretend he was ill; nothing was possible but the bench of magistrates—Colonel Salmon presiding—and Publicity. At half-past eleven or quarter to twelve he sent the despairing message to Oppenshaw; then he collapsed into a cold sort of resignation with hot fits at times.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1832/53126.html","bookId":24,"book":{"id":24,"title":"The Man Who Found Himself","description":"简介： King Charles Street lies in Westminster; you turn a corner and find yourself in Charles Street as one might turn a corner and find oneself in History.
