{"id":695,"no":22,"title":"CHAPTER III JULIA—continued","content":"It was a cross between a hansom cab and a \"growler,\" with the voice of the latter, and the dust of the Farnborough road, with the prospect of a three-mile drive to meet Julia and a three-mile drive back again, did not fill Bobby with joy—also the prospect of having to make explanations. \\n\\n \\n\\n He had quite determined on that. After the arbour business it was impossible to go on with Julia; he had to break whatever bonds there existed between them, and he had to do the business before she got to the hotel. Then came the prospect of having to live with her in the hotel, even for a night. He questioned himself, asking himself were he a cad or not, had he trifled with Julia? As far as memory went, they had both trifled with one another. It was a sudden affair, and no actual promise had been made; he had not even said \"I love you\"—but he had kissed her. The legal mind would, no doubt, have construed that into a declaration[Pg 210] of affection, but Bobby\u0027s mind was not legal—anything but—and as for kissing a girl, if he had been condemned to marry all the girls he had kissed he would have been forced to live in Utah. \\n\\n \\n\\n He had to wait half an hour for the train at Farnborough, and when it drew up out stepped Julia, hot, and dressed in green, dragging a hold-all and a bundle of magazines and newspapers. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"H\u0027are you?\" said Bobby, as they shook hands. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hot,\" said Julia. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He carried the hold-all to the fly and a porter followed with a basket-work portmanteau. When the luggage was stowed in they got in and the fly moved off. \\n\\n \\n\\n Julia was not in a passionate mood; no person is or ever has been after a journey on the London and Wessex and South Coast Railway—unless it is a mood of passion against the railway. She seemed, indeed, disgruntled and critical, and a tone of complaint in her voice cheered up Bobby. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know it\u0027s an awful old fly,\" said he, \"but it\u0027s the best they had; the hotel motor-car is broken down or something.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t you wire me that day,\" said She, \"that you were going off so soon? I only got your wire from here next morning. You promised to meet me and you never turned up. I went to the Albany to see if you were in, and I saw Mr. Tozer. He said you had gone off with half a dozen people in a car——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Only four, not including me,\" cut in Bobby. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Two ladies——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An old French lady and her daughter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s two ladies, isn\u0027t it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose so—you can\u0027t make it three. Then there was uncle; it\u0027s true he\u0027s a host in himself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How\u0027s he going on?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Splendidly.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m very anxious to see him,\" said Julia. \"It\u0027s so seldom one meets anyone really original in this life; most people are copies of others, and generally bad ones at that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s so,\" said Bobby. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How\u0027s the novel going on?\" said Julia. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Heavens!\" said Bobby, \"do you think I can add literary work to my other distractions? The novel is not going on, but the plot is.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How d\u0027you mean?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Uncle Simon. I\u0027ve got the beginning and[Pg 212] middle of a novel in him, but I haven\u0027t got the end.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are going to put him in a book?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wish to goodness I could, and close the covers on him. No, I\u0027m going to weave him into a story—he\u0027s doing most of the weaving, but that\u0027s a detail. Look here, Julia——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been thinking.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been thinking we have made a mistake.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, we. I didn\u0027t write, I thought I\u0027d wait till I saw you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How d\u0027you mean?\" said Julia dryly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Us.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, you know what I mean. It\u0027s just this way, people do foolish things on the spur of the moment.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What have we done foolish?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We haven\u0027t done anything foolish, only I think we were in too great a hurry.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, you know, that evening at your flat.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You mean to say you don\u0027t care for me any more?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, it\u0027s not that; I care for you very much.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Say it at once,\" said Julia. \"You care for me as a sister.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s about it,\" said Bobby. \\n\\n \\n\\n Julia was silent, and only the voice of the fly filled the air. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then she said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s just as well to know where one is.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Are you angry?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not a bit.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He glanced at her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not a bit. You have met someone else. Why not say so?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have,\" said Bobby. \"You know quite well, Julia, one can\u0027t help these things.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know anything about \u0027these things,\u0027 as you call them; I only know that you have ceased to care for me—let that suffice.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She was very calm, and a feeling came to Bobby that she did not care so very deeply for him. It was not a pleasant feeling somehow, although it gave him relief. He had expected her to weep or fly out in a temper, but she was quite calm and ordinary; he almost felt like making love to her again to see if she had cared[Pg 214] for him, but fortunately this feeling passed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We\u0027ll be friends,\" said he. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Absolutely,\" said Julia. \"How could a little thing like that spoil friendship?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Was she jesting with him or in earnest? Bitter, or just herself? \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is she staying at the hotel?\" asked she, after a moment\u0027s silence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She is,\" said Bobby. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s the French girl?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How did you guess that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I knew.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When you explained them and began with the old lady. But the old lady will, no doubt, have her turn next, and to the next girl you\u0027ll explain them, beginning with the girl.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bobby felt very hot and uncomfortable. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now you\u0027re angry with me,\" said he. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not a bit.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, let\u0027s be friends.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Absolutely. I could never fancy you as the enemy of anyone but yourself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bobby wasn\u0027t enjoying the drive, and there was a mile more of it—uphill, mostly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think I\u0027ll get out and give the poor old horse a chance,\" said he; \"these hills are beastly for it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He got out and walked by the fly, glancing occasionally at the silhouette of Julia, who seemed ruminating matters. \\n\\n \\n\\n He was beginning to feel, now, that he had done her an injury, and she had said nothing about going back to-morrow or anything like that, and he was held as by a vice, and Cerise and he would be under the microscope, and Cerise knew nothing about Julia. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then he got into the fly again and five minutes later they drove up to the Rose. Simon was standing in the porch as they drove up; his straw hat was on the back of his head and he had a cigar in his mouth. \\n\\n \\n\\n He looked at Bobby and Julia and grinned slightly. It seemed suddenly to have got into his head that Bobby had been fetching a sweetheart as well as a young lady from the station. It had, in fact, and things that got into Simon\u0027s youthful head in this fashion, allied to things pleasant, were difficult to remove. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1832/53123.html","bookId":24,"book":{"id":24,"title":"The Man Who Found Himself","description":"简介： King Charles Street lies in Westminster; you turn a corner and find yourself in Charles Street as one might turn a corner and find oneself in History.
