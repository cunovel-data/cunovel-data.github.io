{"id":34622,"no":3,"title":"Chapter 3 The Thousand And One Bottles","content":"So it was that on the twenty-ninth day of February, at the beginning of the thaw, this singular person fell out of infinity into Iping village. Next day his luggage arrived through the slush--and very remarkable luggage it was. There were a couple of trunks indeed, such as a rational man might need, but in addition there were a box of books--big, fat books, of which some were just in an incomprehensible handwriting--and a dozen or more crates, boxes, and cases, containing objects packed in straw, as it seemed to Hall, tugging with a casual curiosity at the straw--glass bottles. The stranger, muffled in hat, coat, gloves, and wrapper, came out impatiently to meet Fearenside\u0027s cart, while Hall was having a word or so of gossip preparatory to helping being them in. Out he came, not noticing Fearenside\u0027s dog, who was sniffing in a _dilettante_ spirit at Hall\u0027s legs. \"Come along with those boxes,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve been waiting long enough.\"\n And he came down the steps towards the tail of the cart as if to lay hands on the smaller crate.\n No sooner had Fearenside\u0027s dog caught sight of him, however, than it began to bristle and growl savagely, and when he rushed down the steps it gave an undecided hop, and then sprang straight at his hand. \"Whup!\" cried Hall, jumping back, for he was no hero with dogs, and Fearenside howled, \"Lie down!\" and snatched his whip.\n They saw the dog\u0027s teeth had slipped the hand, heard a kick, saw the dog execute a flanking jump and get home on the stranger\u0027s leg, and heard the rip of his trousering. Then the finer end of Fearenside\u0027s whip reached his property, and the dog, yelping with dismay, retreated under the wheels of the waggon. It was all the business of a swift half-minute. No one spoke, everyone shouted. The stranger glanced swiftly at his torn glove and at his leg, made as if he would stoop to the latter, then turned and rushed swiftly up the steps into the inn. They heard him go headlong across the passage and up the uncarpeted stairs to his bedroom.\n \"You brute, you!\" said Fearenside, climbing off the waggon with his whip in his hand, while the dog watched him through the wheel. \"Come here,\" said Fearenside--\"You\u0027d better.\"\n Hall had stood gaping. \"He wuz bit,\" said Hall. \"I\u0027d better go and see to en,\" and he trotted after the stranger. He met Mrs. Hall in the passage. \"Carrier\u0027s darg,\" he said \"bit en.\"\n He went straight upstairs, and the stranger\u0027s door being ajar, he pushed it open and was entering without any ceremony, being of a naturally sympathetic turn of mind.\n The blind was down and the room dim. He caught a glimpse of a most singular thing, what seemed a handless arm waving towards him, and a face of three huge indeterminate spots on white, very like the face of a pale pansy. Then he was struck violently in the chest, hurled back, and the door slammed in his face and locked. It was so rapid that it gave him no time to observe. A waving of indecipherable shapes, a blow, and a concussion. There he stood on the dark little landing, wondering what it might be that he had seen.\n A couple of minutes after, he rejoined the little group that had formed outside the \"Coach and Horses.\" There was Fearenside telling about it all over again for the second time; there was Mrs. Hall saying his dog didn\u0027t have no business to bite her guests; there was Huxter, the general dealer from over the road, interrogative; and Sandy Wadgers from the forge, judicial; besides women and children, all of them saying fatuities: \"Wouldn\u0027t let en bite _me_, I knows\"; \"\u0027Tasn\u0027t right _have_ such dargs\"; \"Whad _\u0027e_ bite \u0027n for, than?\" and so forth.\n Mr. Hall, staring at them from the steps and listening, found it incredible that he had seen anything so very remarkable happen upstairs. Besides, his vocabulary was altogether too limited to express his impressions.\n \"He don\u0027t want no help, he says,\" he said in answer to his wife\u0027s inquiry. \"We\u0027d better be a-takin\u0027 of his luggage in.\"\n \"He ought to have it cauterised at once,\" said Mr. Huxter; \"especially if it\u0027s at all inflamed.\"\n \"I\u0027d shoot en, that\u0027s what I\u0027d do,\" said a lady in the group.\n Suddenly the dog began growling again.\n \"Come along,\" cried an angry voice in the doorway, and there stood the muffled stranger with his collar turned up, and his hat-brim bent down. \"The sooner you get those things in the better I\u0027ll be pleased.\" It is stated by an anonymous bystander that his trousers and gloves had been changed.\n \"Was you hurt, sir?\" said Fearenside. \"I\u0027m rare sorry the darg--\"\n \"Not a bit,\" said the stranger. \"Never broke the skin. Hurry up with those things.\"\n He then swore to himself, so Mr. Hall asserts.\n Directly the first crate was, in accordance with his directions, carried into the parlour, the stranger flung himself upon it with extraordinary eagerness, and began to unpack it, scattering the straw with an utter disregard of Mrs. Hall\u0027s carpet. And from it he began to produce bottles--little fat bottles containing powders, small and slender bottles containing coloured and white fluids, fluted blue bottles labeled Poison, bottles with round bodies and slender necks, large green-glass bottles, large white-glass bottles, bottles with glass stoppers and frosted labels, bottles with fine corks, bottles with bungs, bottles with wooden caps, wine bottles, salad-oil bottles--putting them in rows on the chiffonnier, on the mantel, on the table under the window, round the floor, on the bookshelf--everywhere. The chemist\u0027s shop in Bramblehurst could not boast half so many. Quite a sight it was. Crate after crate yielded bottles, until all six were empty and the table high with straw; the only things that came out of these crates besides the bottles were a number of test-tubes and a carefully packed balance.\n And directly the crates were unpacked, the stranger went to the window and set to work, not troubling in the least about the litter of straw, the fire which had gone out, the box of books outside, nor for the trunks and other luggage that had gone upstairs.\n When Mrs. Hall took his dinner in to him, he was already so absorbed in his work, pouring little drops out of the bottles into test-tubes, that he did not hear her until she had swept away the bulk of the straw and put the tray on the table, with some little emphasis perhaps, seeing the state that the floor was in. Then he half turned his head and immediately turned it away again. But she saw he had removed his glasses; they were beside him on the table, and it seemed to her that his eye sockets were extraordinarily hollow. He put on his spectacles again, and then turned and faced her. She was about to complain of the straw on the floor when he anticipated her.\n \"I wish you wouldn\u0027t come in without knocking,\" he said in the tone of abnormal exasperation that seemed so characteristic of him.\n \"I knocked, but seemingly--\"\n \"Perhaps you did. But in my investigations--my really very urgent and necessary investigations--the slightest disturbance, the jar of a door--I must ask you--\"\n \"Certainly, sir. You can turn the lock if you\u0027re like that, you know. Any time.\"\n \"A very good idea,\" said the stranger.\n \"This stror, sir, if I might make so bold as to remark--\"\n \"Don\u0027t. If the straw makes trouble put it down in the bill.\" And he mumbled at her--words suspiciously like curses.\n He was so odd, standing there, so aggressive and explosive, bottle in one hand and test-tube in the other, that Mrs. Hall was quite alarmed. But she was a resolute woman. \"In which case, I should like to know, sir, what you consider--\"\n \"A shilling--put down a shilling. Surely a shilling\u0027s enough?\"\n \"So be it,\" said Mrs. Hall, taking up the table-cloth and beginning to spread it over the table. \"If you\u0027re satisfied, of course--\"\n He turned and sat down, with his coat-collar toward her.\n All the afternoon he worked with the door locked and, as Mrs. Hall testifies, for the most part in silence. But once there was a concussion and a sound of bottles ringing together as though the table had been hit, and the smash of a bottle flung violently down, and then a rapid pacing athwart the room. Fearing \"something was the matter,\" she went to the door and listened, not caring to knock.\n \"I can\u0027t go on,\" he was raving. \"I _can\u0027t_ go on. Three hundred thousand, four hundred thousand! The huge multitude! Cheated! All my life it may take me! ... Patience! Patience indeed! ... Fool! fool!\"\n There was a noise of hobnails on the bricks in the bar, and Mrs. Hall had very reluctantly to leave the rest of his soliloquy. When she returned the room was silent again, save for the faint crepitation of his chair and the occasional clink of a bottle. It was all over; the stranger had resumed work.\n When she took in his tea she saw broken glass in the corner of the room under the concave mirror, and a golden stain that had been carelessly wiped. She called attention to it.\n \"Put it down in the bill,\" snapped her visitor. \"For God\u0027s sake don\u0027t worry me. If there\u0027s damage done, put it down in the bill,\" and he went on ticking a list in the exercise book before him.\n \"I\u0027ll tell you something,\" said Fearenside, mysteriously. It was late in the afternoon, and they were in the little beer-shop of Iping Hanger.\n \"Well?\" said Teddy Henfrey.\n \"This chap you\u0027re speaking of, what my dog bit. Well--he\u0027s black. Leastways, his legs are. I seed through the tear of his trousers and the tear of his glove. You\u0027d have expected a sort of pinky to show, wouldn\u0027t you? Well--there wasn\u0027t none. Just blackness. I tell you, he\u0027s as black as my hat.\"\n \"My sakes!\" said Henfrey. \"It\u0027s a rummy case altogether. Why, his nose is as pink as paint!\"\n \"That\u0027s true,\" said Fearenside. \"I knows that. And I tell \u0027ee what I\u0027m thinking. That marn\u0027s a piebald, Teddy. Black here and white there--in patches. And he\u0027s ashamed of it. He\u0027s a kind of half-breed, and the colour\u0027s come off patchy instead of mixing. I\u0027ve heard of such things before. And it\u0027s the common way with horses, as any one can see.\"\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/295/447.html","bookId":361,"book":{"id":361,"title":"隐身人 The Invisible Man","description":"简介： The Invisible Man is a science fiction novella by H.G.
