{"id":19133,"no":1,"title":"CHAPTER I","content":"It was Jim\u0027s last day at home. He stood in the centre of the fragrant garden and watched the glory of color suffusing the Surrey hills towards the west. With a sigh he turned away and walked to the house. \"Where\u0027s Diana?\" he called, as he came from the garden through the casement-window of the library. \"Diana—why, she\u0027s in bed an hour ago, I should hope,\" replied his aunt, Lady Elizabeth Kerhill. \"She and Mabel went with Bates to see the decorations and then said good-night. Surely you didn\u0027t expect me to allow the children to stay up for the ball?\" Mabel was her daughter; Diana Marjoribanks was a young girl of thirteen, who had come to visit her. \"Poor imps! they were so excited all day, and followed me about the gun-room where I was doing some packing. They wanted me to coax you to allow them to see the ball, and the tenantry welcome Henry to-night.\" Lady Kerhill elevated her eyebrows in questioning amazement at Jim, as she nervously twisted the lace of her gown, and with an impatient gesture motioned the subject aside. She was a tall, angular woman, with a profile like the head on a bronze coin; there was a suggestion of the eagle in her personality, and by her friends she was likened to the famous Sarah Churchill, the first Duchess of Marlborough. To-night her face showed that anxious thoughts were crowding in on her as she apprehensively watched the big, carved oak door leading into the hall. Jim knew his aunt\u0027s firmness of character, and as silence followed his words, he feared further discussion was useless; but the wistful faces of the children at tea-time in the nursery, as they coaxed him to plead for them to see the fun, made him venture a final appeal. \"You know, Aunt, Sir Charles brought Di over to stay with Mabel so that she might see the festivities and incidentally say good-bye to me, so you might turn angel and let Diana dance once with me at the very beginning of the ball. I sha\u0027n\u0027t see my little playfellow for ages, you know.\" A sound from outside held Lady Elizabeth\u0027s attention more intently than Jim\u0027s pleading words. He crossed to her in the window-enclosure and laid his hand caressingly on her shoulder. \"The Colonel wired me that we were leaving Paddington at nine to-morrow morning, and India is a long way off, Auntie mine.\" \"Nonsense,\" answered Lady Elizabeth, as she rose from the deep window-seat. \"You are almost twenty, and Diana is only a babe—isn\u0027t she, Henry?\" She glanced up and appealed to the young man who rather noisily entered the library. \"Who\u0027s a babe? Diana? Why, mater, she\u0027s a little witch, and I promised her I\u0027d let her see the illuminations at ten and then old Burrow should carry her off to bed.\" Henry Wynnegate, seventh Earl of Kerhill, dropped into a great settle close to the fire. The ball was for the tenantry in celebration of his return, after five years\u0027 absence with his regiment. He was a tall, heavy-set young soldier of seven-and-twenty, with the famous Wynnegate beauty, but it was marred by the shifting expression of his rather deep-set eyes and the heavy lines about his mouth. Self was his god: it showed in every expression of his face and in every action of his life. Jim Wynnegate, his cousin, the son of the younger brother of the late Earl, Henry\u0027s father, turned from the window as Henry entered. In the young boy\u0027s face—for he seemed younger than his years—one could easily trace the family resemblance; but Jim, with his great, clean spirit shining in his honest gray eyes, invited confidence and won it, from a mongrel dog to a superior officer. He was taller than Henry, and as slim as a young sapling. The delicate, sensitive mouth was balanced by a strong chin. In the oak-lined room, grown almost black with age, the candle-lights flickering in the heavy brass sconces, stood these three last descendants of a great family. The Earl\u0027s brother, Dick Wynnegate, had run away with the daughter of an impecunious colonel. A few years later, while on service in India, he was shot, and the young wife lived only to bring the tiny boy Jim home and to leave him with her husband\u0027s brother. Even then the fortunes of the Wynnegates were somewhat impaired, but the old Earl had taken the boy to his heart, and on his death had confided him to his wife to share their fortune with his son Henry. His last words were, \"Be good to poor Dick\u0027s boy.\" The estates were entailed, so no provision could be made by him for Jim, but Lady Kerhill, in her cold, just fashion, had tried to make Dick\u0027s boy happy. Deep in his heart, Jim remembered the years that followed; remembered the selfish domination of the elder boy; remembered the blind adoration of his aunt for her son, the bearer of the torch, who was to carry on the golden light of the house of Kerhill. In the Anglo-Saxon idolatry of the Countess of Kerhill for the male of the family, all the old traditions and beliefs were justified. Her boy—-the man-child who was to be the head of the house—was her obsession. The tiny, flower-like girl who came shortly before her husband\u0027s death, learned soon to turn to Cousin Jim for comfort when her brother carelessly crushed her little joys, as he selfishly planned and fought for his own gratification. Instinctively Jim watched his aunt, who, at Henry\u0027s word, had started to move towards him. \"Of course, if you care to go and fetch Diana, I shall be happy,\" Lady Kerhill said. Henry lounged back in his chair. \"Well, if I forget, Jim can remember for me—eh, Jim?\" Lady Kerhill\u0027s face became grave as she leaned over Henry\u0027s chair and closely studied the flushed face. She found there confirmation of the fear that had preyed on her mind for the past half-hour. \"Oh, Henry, you\u0027ve broken your word,\" she whispered. The reckless challenge of Henry\u0027s dark eyes as he moved impatiently in his chair was his only answer. Then in a burst of ill-concealed resentment he rose: \"Don\u0027t nag, mother.\" He swayed slightly as he crossed to the open casement. As Jim turned to him, he sullenly pushed him aside. \"And don\u0027t you preach,\" he muttered, as he started for the garden. Jim quickly caught him by the shoulder, \"Pull yourself together, Henry. It\u0027s eight o\u0027clock and the people are gathering in the park.\" Henry\u0027s only reply was a snarl as he disappeared in the shadow of the trees. The broad window opened level on an Old World garden that led into the great park beyond. The late twilight of the July night was bathing park and garden in a curious, unearthly light which made strange spectres of the slowly waving yew-trees. The scent of the rose-bushes, the call of the late nightingale to his mate, and the ghostly sundial, sentinel-like, guarding the old place, made a fitting environment for Maudsley Towers. On a slight hill beyond the park, Jim could see the ruins of the famous Norman church. To the right, at the farther end of the garden, was the Fairies\u0027 Corner. There among the trees the fairies of the field were supposed to sleep, and to listen to and grant the requests of the children, who had the courage to venture to them at even-tide. Jim\u0027s thoughts were busy to-night; all the old memories seemed to tug at his heartstrings. He had carried Diana Marjoribanks there on her first visit to the Towers. She was six then and he was twelve. She had clung to him and hid her head on his shoulder—the tiny body had stiffened with fear—as they made their way to the dark enclosure of the trees. He could still hear her prayer. \"Dear Fairy, please make Henry kinder to poor Jim, poor Mabel, and poor me!\" Even then, Henry had been the little tyrant of the Towers. And yet to-night Henry\u0027s wish, as of old, was law to his mother. She conceded Diana to him at his first careless request, although in all probability he would forget the longing child in the nursery—forget his promise to give her pleasure, as he had forgotten so often when he was a boy. Jim roused himself; as he turned to Lady Elizabeth he caught a glimpse of her with the mask off, the bitter disappointment of the mother\u0027s heart showing in every line of her proud face. He crossed to her, but the sound of carriage-wheels turning into the driveway heralded the approach of the first arrivals, and before Jim could speak the doors were thrown open to the guests. Lady Elizabeth gave one look of appeal to Jim. It said: \"Help Henry and me!\" Up-stairs in the right wing of the old house, a tall, slender child crouched close to the nursery window. She had crept from her cot, and, wrapped in a coverlet, waited, and clung to the belief that Henry would come for her. Jim had said he would try, but Henry had promised. She was old enough to know that what Henry desired he obtained. Her little face was pressed closer and closer to the window as she listened to the swelling music and saw the guests thronging towards the park. Carriage after carriage brought its load of finery, until the child fancied that the entire county must be gathered below. She could see through the climbing roses down into the library, which jutted out at a sharp angle almost opposite to the nursery window. But of Jim or Henry she could catch no glimpse. The stars began to creep out and blink at the tiny figure in the window-seat. Gradually the entire house grew quiet. All—even the servants—had joined the revelry in the park. The music crashed louder. Fiery showers of illumination could be seen shooting and flaming into the sky. It grew cold. Tighter she drew the coverlet and held closer the small puppy that nestled warm in her arms and slept. In the adjoining room Mabel, Lady Kerhill\u0027s little daughter, lay fast asleep. \"It\u0027s Jim\u0027s last night. I must say good-bye,\" the child whispered to the fleecy white bundle in her arms. \"I must keep awake and say good-bye.\" Fainter grew the music, darker the sky, and heavier the curved eyelids. Slowly, with a sigh the child slipped to the floor, and the brown head pillowed itself on the cushioned window-seat. Diana slept. In the park, the tenantry, eager to meet their young master, were shouting themselves hoarse. A speech of welcome followed the dazzling illuminations. Over it all, Lady Elizabeth, with Sir Charles Marjoribanks, presided. Diana and her father lived on a neighboring estate, and Sir Charles had come to-night to rejoice with his old friend on the return of her son. Sir Charles was a man of slender physique, with a gentle, winning manner; extremely delicate in health, he led for the most part a secluded life, and since the death of his wife, at Diana\u0027s birth, went little into the social world. Diana\u0027s childhood had been almost as lonely as Jim\u0027s had been in his aunt\u0027s home. To-night Sir Charles delighted in seeing the house of Wynnegate honored. He scarcely noted the reckless demeanor and wild spirits of Henry as unusual; only for Jim and Lady Elizabeth was it a night of anxiety. Never for a moment did Henry escape Jim\u0027s watchful eyes; slip after slip made by Henry was covered by Jim\u0027s tact and thoughtfulness, and with simple dignity he carried the night to success. Only when he stood aside and saw Henry receive the demonstrations of the county and tenantry did the bitterness of his position force itself upon him. Not once did Henry remember his promise to the child waiting for him. Jim remembered; but the look of appeal from his aunt, and the sullen defiance of Henry, kept him close to his cousin\u0027s side. The final bars of the last dance were dying away and the ball was drawing to its brilliant end. In the east, a pale streak of light was beginning to show over the horizon. Sir Charles, half an hour before, had gone to his room. Exhausted by the long evening\u0027s anxiety and late festivities, Lady Kerhill forgot that Jim was to leave early in the morning and that she would not see him again, and had retired to her own apartment. In the great hall, tired and excited groups of guests were saying good-night. \"It\u0027s good-bye for Jim,\" Sir John Applegate, Diana\u0027s cousin, called as the last carriage drove away. A half-whimsical smile played over Jim\u0027s face. Then some one remembered that he was leaving England. As he turned from the door, he met the eyes of his cousin fastened on him, all the latent rebellion rising to the surface. Henry Kerhill was sober enough to know that Jim had watched and guarded him through the entire night, and had stood between him and disgrace. As he leaned against the tall mantel, the bitter consciousness that the young boy had proved himself of fine mettle, ate like acid into his feverish brain. He dug his hands deep into his pockets, then with a lurch he pulled himself together. Without a word he turned, crossed to the twisted staircase, and grasping the oak rails, slowly ascended. From the landing came the slam of a heavy door, and Jim knew that he was alone. So this was the end. The striking of the bell in the church-tower reminded him that it was now four o\u0027clock and that he was to leave at six. His luggage had been sent on ahead the previous day. He changed quickly, without disturbing the tired servants, and in half an hour was ready to walk to the station. As he came down the broad staircase, lined with portraits of the ancestors of the house of Wynnegate, a slight noise in the corridor leading off from the broad landing attracted him. Before he could turn, a low voice called: \"Jim—Jim!\" It was Diana. Standing there in the dim light of the corridor, she made an entrancing picture. With the parted hair falling away from the low brow, around the oval face, and the far-apart blue-black eyes, she looked like the child Madonna of Rosetti\u0027s \"Annunciation.\" The coverlet was drawn close about her, the puppy still hidden under its folds. \"It\u0027s Di, Jim,\" she whispered as she hurried to him. \"I waited and waited for you—I knew you were going away and I wanted to say good-bye. Burrow promised that she would let me see you, but she\u0027s fast asleep, and so is Mabel. I tried to wake them but I couldn\u0027t.\" The little figure cuddled into his arms. Jim\u0027s heart was very full as he looked at the frail child in the early dawn, the shadows of a restless night showing on her delicately modelled face. He drew her into a window-enclosure, and wrapping the heavy curtains about her, held her fast. \"Say something,\" the sweet voice coaxed. \"I shall miss you so and wait for you to come back. You will come back, won\u0027t you?\" Jim\u0027s only answer was to press the little head close to his heart. In all the great house, she alone had cared to say good-bye—to wish him in her child\u0027s way godspeed. \"See,\" Diana continued as she opened her arms, \"here is something for you to take away with you, so that you sha\u0027n\u0027t be lonely any more.\" She opened her arms and held up the soft roll of fur with its blinking eyes and pink-tipped nose. \"Di, dear Di,\" Jim whispered, as he patted the towsled hair. Quite seriously her big eyes searched Jim\u0027s face to be sure that her gift truly won approval. The church clock boomed the hour of five. Jim hurriedly rose and slipped the dog into his coat-pocket. \"Good-bye, Di, and God bless you!\" She clung quietly to him with her arms tight around his neck for a long time; then the little face quivered, and in a burst of tears she sank back among the cushions of the window-seat. Jim hesitated a moment, then with a final pat on the dear head, hurriedly reached the doorway and was out on the high-road. From a turn at the top of the common he caught a last glimpse of the great house, and in the big window of the hall could see the faint outline of the white figure still huddled among the cushions. All the suppression of the past days gave way. With a cry, Jim threw himself down on the damp ground and convulsive sobs shook his body. It had all been his—his home, his country—and he was leaving it without a friend, without a loving hand or voice to cheer him. He suddenly felt a damp nose thrust into his hand, and a soft tongue began to lap his face as though in sympath","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2048/58370.html","bookId":576,"book":{"id":576,"title":"The Squaw Man","description":"简介： It was Jim\u0027s last day at home.
