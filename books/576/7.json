{"id":19139,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VII","content":"\n Upon the expiration of his sick leave, Jim returned to his regiment, stationed at Dorden, a few miles from Dinningfold. He found the situation but little changed at the Towers. Henry\u0027s uncertain moods made Jim\u0027s visits a doubtful pleasure, but since his first day at Pont Street there had been no decided outbreak on his cousin\u0027s part. \n \n The autumn brought with it the calamitous war in South Africa, and all thoughts were concentrated on preparing the Yeomanry of the country to be ready to join the Regulars in the field. Jim\u0027s services were readily enlisted by Henry, and in the organization of the county\u0027s Yeomanry he became an active force. His work often required him to spend days at the Towers. \n \n With the passing of the last days of the old year, Henry\u0027s moodiness increased; even Lady Elizabeth seemed hopeless and unable to avert them, and Jim could see the bitter disillusionment that Diana daily encountered. During the winter Henry\u0027s attitude towards Diana changed; her presence was an irritation to him. At times he made every effort to regain his lost footing, but again and again he forfeited the newly acquired grace which her clemency granted. Days of absence from the Towers were now not uncommon. The light gradually faded from Lady Elizabeth\u0027s face, leaving it a haunting gray mask. But no word was spoken by either of the women to Jim. Both were indefatigable in their efforts to relieve the condition of the soldiers freezing on the African veldt. A fund was started in the county to be used for the widows and orphans of the fighting men, and Henry was placed at the head of it. \n \n In London the innumerable bazaars and fêtes given to swell the various funds of relief were the principal functions of the fashionable world. Jim, who had just returned from a visit to Scotland over the holiday season, was standing near a stall in Albert Hall, presided over by Mrs. Hobart Chichester Chichester Jones. As she eagerly turned towards him there was no doubt of the American woman\u0027s desire to gain his approbation. A friendship had sprung up between them since Jim\u0027s return from India, and her frankness amused him. It was Sadie Jones\u0027s second year in London, and the half of the great houses that had been denied her the previous year were now open to her and she was a much sought personage at their festivities. \n \n Whether this was due to her insouciant face with its tip-tilted nose, or the slight lisp that made her American accent seem so fetching, her friends could not decide. Her enemies—and Sadie Jones had them at Battle Creek—declared it was her charming characteristic of never remembering a social slight; of generously forgiving the offender and in true Christian spirit offering the other cheek. They forgot what Jim and her sponsors in London could plainly see—it was her frankness that razed to the ground her social barrier. When she spoke quite frankly of a boarding-house her mother had kept in a mining-town where Hobart Jones had been a paying guest, and told in picturesque exaggeration of her starved youth and pitiful hatred of her environment—of the longing to escape to the great life of Europe with its men and women of tradition—she disarmed the gossips. She frankly acknowledged what was her detractors\u0027 store of tittle-tattle. It was a unique game and it won. \n \n Jim watched her with tolerant interest as she inveigled a young guardsman into giving a substantial donation to the cause. As he idly surveyed the scene he wondered at Diana\u0027s failure to attend the fête. The tired women who had been in attendance were disposing of the remains of their stock. The eager crowd that had thronged the hall and paid a half-crown to be served tea by a duchess, or to see a peeress act as barmaid in rivalry to a popular Rosalind of the stage, was gradually thinning out. \n \n Jim started to leave the flag-bedecked hall with its litter of packages and debris-strewn floor as proofs of the day\u0027s profitable traffic. Sadie Jones, who had been skilfully effecting her sales and keeping him in sight, turned to him. \n \n \"Wait and drive home with me to dinner. The brougham\u0027s at the door. I have news for you of Lady Kerhill. I have just returned from a visit.\" \n \n Mrs. Jones lived in a box of a house in Curzon Street. It was a setting especially designed to suit her small, birdlike personality. But Jim\u0027s stalwart frame seemed grotesquely out of proportion in the small French salon. The dinner was an amusing tête-à-tête with Sadie at her most vivacious best, telling anecdotes of the plains she loved. \n \n \"Sometimes I long for the smell of the alkali. It chokes one, but I find the fogs far harder to swallow. I was bred to it.\" \n \n Hitherto her descriptions of the prairie had often made Jim long to see the country she painted so vividly. Suddenly she turned to Jim and with quick decision said: \n \n \"I can\u0027t understand your Englishman\u0027s point of view. Why, in America, if Hoby Jones had treated me as Lord Kerhill is treating his wife, there would be ructions. Yes, ructions,\" she calmly went on, in answer to Jim\u0027s look of amazement. \"Lord Kerhill is your cousin, I know, but Lady Kerhill is an angel. Why don\u0027t you do something?\" \n \n For a moment Jim could not quite grasp her irrelevant outburst. Then he learned that Diana\u0027s failure to appear at the bazaar was due to days of accumulated anxiety at the Towers. Henry had been away for a week without a word of explanation to those at home. \n \n \"Of course,\" Sadie Jones continued as she leaned back and puffed her cigarette, \"I know the truth. We all do here in town. He\u0027s drinking inordinately and leading a most flagrant life. An earl may be a stable-boy, I find, and Kerhill is certainly behaving like one. Lady Elizabeth is trying to cover up the situation, and Lady Kerhill seems dazed by recent events.\" \n \n Of the sincerity of her interest in Diana, Jim could have no doubt. Under her frivolities she had an appreciation of what was fine in men and women. As she talked she was carefully watching the effect of her words on Jim; her instinct had long ago told her that Jim\u0027s interest in Diana was no usual one—how unusual she did not care to probe. She knew that he was the one person who might have an influence over Henry; she also knew that by this conversation she might be stirring up a situation that would far from benefit her, but she played the game fair. She was rich—Jim was almost poor. Often she wondered and hoped—but so far her dreams, she knew, were built alone upon her desires. \n \n They talked for another hour, and when Jim left the Curzon Street house he promised Sadie Jones he would see Henry. From her window Sadie watched him swinging down the street. She had tried to serve Diana, but, she asked, what had she accomplished for herself? She lighted another cigarette and settled her foot against the fender. She was thinking of Jim\u0027s face as he had listened to her talk about Diana. \n \n The fire burned gray. A line of \"dead soldiers,\" as the boys at Battle Creek had called the half-burned cigarettes, lay on the hearthstone—a tribute to the length of her reverie. Another expression of the boys at home came back forcibly to her as she left the room and crossed to her bedchamber. After all, she had been \"dead game.\" Gain or loss, she did not regret her evening\u0027s work. \n \n As Jim walked along Piccadilly, he knew that Henry\u0027s liaisons were now town-talk. It was useless to close his eyes to the suspicions of the past month. Sadie Jones represented the world\u0027s opinion, and what she tried to warn him about would soon be brutally brought to Diana\u0027s knowledge. At the club he could find no news of Henry. All night he thought out the question of the wisdom of his approaching Henry, but the strength of his determination only grew as the gray of the dawn increased. \n \n The following morning he called at Pont Street. He found Henry lingering over some breakfast. A brandy-glass and empty soda-bottle aroused Jim\u0027s suspicions, while the bloated circles under Henry\u0027s eyes, and his yellow, discolored skin, were unmistakable proofs of a recent debauch. As Jim entered, Henry looked up with surprise. \n \n \"Didn\u0027t expect you back so soon,\" he said, after their strained greetings. Henry seemed ill at ease. \"Anything up?\" he went on, as Jim didn\u0027t speak. \n \n There was a moment\u0027s portentous silence. \n \n \"Henry,\" Jim began, very calmly, \"I\u0027ve got to speak to you about certain matters.\" \n \n Henry, who had been shifting about in his chair, became motionless. His clinched hands strained purple as he grasped the chair rail. \n \n \"About the—Yeomanry—work?\" he half stammered while his eyes furtively sought Jim\u0027s face. \n \n But Jim, who was thinking only of Diana and the difficulty of alluding to Henry\u0027s recent conduct, failed to notice his faltering words and frightened expression. \n \n \"Oh no—no,\" he answered. \"That\u0027s going on all right, I hear.\" He hesitated. Then with a quick breath he said, \"It\u0027s no use. I\u0027ve got to blurt out what\u0027s troubling me. All the town is talking about your life; its flagrance, its indecencies. Do you realize that it will soon reach Diana, and that Lady Elizabeth is quivering under the strain of a certain amount of knowledge which she is hiding, and is dreading further disclosures?\" \n \n As Jim spoke he seemed to gain courage. \"Don\u0027t speak. Let me have my say,\" he quietly commanded as Henry rose and attempted a blustering manner. \"I am the only man close to Lady Elizabeth and Diana. For Sir Charles to become aware of this scandalous condition of affairs would be disastrous. You know that perfectly. Now tell me, in God\u0027s name, why you married Di if you wished to lead this life?\" He paused. \"Can\u0027t you pull yourself together? It\u0027s not too late. So far nothing definite is known to either Di or Lady Elizabeth, and you may trust me.\" He rose and crossed to Henry. \"It\u0027s all true, I suppose—what I\u0027m accusing you of—isn\u0027t it?\" There was no answer. He laid his hand on Henry\u0027s shoulder. \"Tell me that it\u0027s over and that you mean to go straight.\" \n \n Henry turned. All his rebellion seemed to have slipped from him. Suddenly he dropped into a chair and buried his head in his hands. \n \n \"I\u0027m not fit—not fit, do you hear?—for Di. I married her because I loved her. Yes, I did. But you don\u0027t know what it is to fight daily the devil\u0027s desire. God! what do you know about it? I am in the meshes. I have sunk lower and lower. You want to know about this woman the world links with my disgrace. Well, I tried to break with her when I married Di—I swear I did—but I can\u0027t. She is like a dog that one has grown attached to—you can\u0027t fling it out of your life completely. There has always been a wall between Diana and me. I tried in the beginning to reach her, but she\u0027s afraid of me—I know it.\" \n \n As the torrent of words choked him, he stopped with a quick passion of agony. He was sincere in this confession of his weakness; Jim could not doubt him, though he was astonished at the admission. He had expected Henry to assail him with hard words and insolent denials. The acknowledged truth was sickening. Henry mechanically took some brandy; he seemed a vibrating bundle of torments. \n \n Jim watched him closely. \"I don\u0027t want to preach, Henry,\" he said, \"but when you stop that,\"—he pointed to the half-empty flask—\"you\u0027ll have half conquered yourself, and the rest will be far easier. This drinking will pull you into days of horror, days that would mean desolation to us all.\" \n \n He hesitated. Henry crossed to the chimney and leaned against it with his back to Jim. \n \n \"There is every chance for you,\" continued Jim. \"In three months you can have regained your place with Di, and think—think what it would mean to your mother.\" \n \n Henry did not move; his head was resting on his outstretched arms, lying across the mantel edge. The broken figure of Henry touched Jim deeply. \"It\u0027s all right, old man. We\u0027ll forget this. Forgive my frankness, but, after all, your interests are mine; your mother and your home were mine, and Di—was like a little sister, so I had to speak. I\u0027ll not say another word. I\u0027m off.\" And almost before Henry could realize it, Jim had left him—left him with the dull burning in his heart and brain. \n \n So Jim knew. It had been a relief to acknowledge his pent-up remorse, but he was more deeply involved than his cousin suspected. Jim knew but half; the other half, with its awful, dreaded discovery, walked ever beside him. He made a sudden rush to the door as though to recall Jim, to unburden himself and be saved, but the momentary impulse died. He stumbled heavily into a chair; it was useless. He alone could save the situation, and the half that Jim knew would be bitter enough to face in his daily companionship with him. \n \n August came with its heather-clad hills, but England rejoiced less than usual in the beauty of the great flower-garden which the entire country-side resembled. Over it all hung the tragic symbol of war. The call of Africa for men had been appalling. In the park of the Towers a detachment of Yeomanry were encamped for a fortnight\u0027s training, and the restful beauty of the place for days had been broken by the firing manoeuvres of the men. To-night all was quiet, with only the sounds from the men in their tents faintly reaching the Towers. Henry was giving a dinner to the officers in command and coffee was being served in the garden. A flaming border of evening primroses were opening their yellow, cuplike blossoms, In the distance a boy\u0027s clear voice was singing: \n \n \"Oh, Tommy, Tommy Atkins, you\u0027re a good \u0027un, \u0027eart and \u0027and, \n You\u0027re a credit to your country and to all your native land.\" \n \n \n Lady Elizabeth had gathered a house-party to see the afternoon\u0027s manoeuvres and to remain for the dinner. The Bishop leaned back in his chair and folded his hands over his apron; his short, lean legs were stretched out comfortably—the Kerhills knew how to entertain the Church, he was convinced. Near him sat Sir John Applegate and Mrs. Chichester Chichester Jones. Close to a great bed of white pansies, with scarlet standard roses gleaming like sentinels over the delicate white blossoms, were Mabel, Diana, and Mr. Chiswick, the young ascetic curate. Henry, who was standing near Lady Elizabeth, kept his eyes moodily on the ground. Sir Charles, with a heavy shawl wrapped around him, was stretched out in a long basket-chair. The air was so still that the moving of a bird in its nest or the rustling of a leaf disturbed its silence. \n \n \"God bless you, Tommy Atkins— \n Here\u0027s a country\u0027s \u0027ealth to you.\" \n \n \n The voice ceased. \n \n Sir John had been telling a story to Mrs. Jones of the mule who drew a pension from the American government. \n \n \"Heard that story in America. Rather good, eh, Mrs. Hobart Chi—\" ignominiously he stood stricken by the American name. The Bishop, seeing his bewilderment turned quickly and whispered the dreadful cognomen. As Sir John finished the broken sentence there was a quiet laugh. \n \n Henry leaned over his mother. \"Mater,\" he said, \"Don\u0027t you think that Mrs. Hobart Chichester Chichester Jones would make a ripping match for Jim? I wish you\u0027d try and make an opportunity to help it along.\" \n \n As he spoke he already saw the gold from the Battle Creek mines pouring into the coffers of the house of Kerhill. Lady Elizabeth looked up with sudden comprehension. The American was charming; her look reassured Henry. \n \n \"Most assuredly. I\u0027ll do what I can.\" \n \n From the drawing-room came the sound of music. An impromptu dance had been arranged by Diana for the young people, who were beginning to arrive. At a message from Bates she quietly went towards the open casement to meet her guests. Henry followed. \n \n As the others started to follow, Sir John and the Bishop held a whispered consultation. Then the Bishop, bursting with importance, turned to Sir John and said: \n \n \"Shall we take the ladies into our confidence, Sir John?\" \n \n \"By all means, Bishop; yes, do.\" \n \n Mabel and Mrs. Jones joined in the supplication. \n \n \"Kerhill\u0027s brother officers,\" the Bishop began, \"have purchased a very beautiful loving-cup in appreciation of his work for the fund, which we have arranged to present to-morrow afternoon to the Earl.\" \n \n \"Oh, how charming, and what a delightful surprise!\" Lady Elizabeth said. These moments of joy in Henry were rare events in her existence. \n \n \"But,\" said Sadie Jones, \"isn\u0027t Captain James Wynnegate to get a loving-cup, too?\" \n \n Sir John answered, \"Oh, he\u0027s only the secretary of the fund.\" \n \n The waltz tune, with its enticing beat, grew louder and louder, and soon the garden was deserted by all save Sir Charles, who remained there absorbed in his thoughts. \n \n Diana, having seen her guests dancing, and fearful that her father might remain too long in the garden, hurriedly returned to him. She stood in the open window and tenderly watched the closely wrapped figure. The moonlight intensified his pallor; it had been an event that he should come to them that night. She saw him smile. \n \n \"Well, father,\" she said, \"are you having a happy time?\" \n \n He rose and drew her close to him. \"My dear child, I can\u0027t tell you how much this has pleased me. It is a great joy to me to know that my daughter is married to the distinguished head of one of our great families, a man so loved, so honored—a pillar of society, and a bulwark of the empire.\" \n \n Never for a moment had he suspected the misery of Diana\u0027s marriage. Not a quiver of emotion showed on her calm face as she drew her arm into his and said, quietly, \"Yes, father.\" \n \n \"I haven\u0027t forgotten your opposition to this match,\" but Charles continued, \"although I dare say you have, my dear, and I am naturally pleased that events have vindicated me. Your husband cuts a noble figure in the world, and I am grateful beyond words to see you so happy.\" \n \n As Diana gradually led Sir Charles from his seat to the house, she again answered, \"Yes, father.\" \n \n During the past months her life had grown more dreary. If it had not been for Jim—dear Jim—what would she have done? Her fragrant mind had never been disloyal to Henry. Often she had longed to go to her father, but her solicitude for him prevented her from bringing disaster to him. As they reached the door Lady Elizabeth called: \n \n \"Have you seen Jim, Diana?\" \n \n Jim had been down in the park doing some service for a sick trooper; Diana explained this to Lady Elizabeth. He had promised to return in time for the dancing. \n \n \"By-the-way, my dear,\" Lady Elizabeth began, \"if you get an opportunity, I wish you would say a judicious word in praise of Mrs. Hobart Chichester Chichester Jones. Jim, you know, sets such an extraordinary value on your opinion.\" \n \n A quick feeling of dislike filled Diana—why, she could not explain. \n \n \"What do you wish me to do?\" she said. \"Praise her American accent or her American money?\" Before she had finished the sentence she was ashamed. She really liked Sadie Jones; the sneer had been unworthy. She was about to retract her words when Jim hurriedly came up the garden-walk. As she entered the library with Sir Charles he called: \n \n \"Don\u0027t forget our waltz, Diana.\" \n \n \"I won\u0027t, Jim.\" \n \n Lady Elizabeth sank on to the stone bench. She watched Jim, whose eyes were still following Diana\u0027s receding figure. This was the moment in which she might serve Henry. In the music-room Sadie Jones was singing: \n \n \"Tout lasse, tout passé—\" \n \n \n Jim began","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2048/58376.html","bookId":576,"book":{"id":576,"title":"The Squaw Man","description":"简介： It was Jim\u0027s last day at home.
