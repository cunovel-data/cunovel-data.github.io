{"id":19153,"no":21,"title":"CHAPTER XXI","content":"And it was to this that James Wynnegate had come, was the first thought of Malcolm Petrie as he surveyed the crude place with its marks of poverty and failure. Like all those intimate with the Wynnegate family, he knew of the mysterious disappearance of Jim Wynnegate at the time of the embezzlement from the Relief Fund. Although his brother, Johnston Petrie, had been the active adviser of the family, he had personally known Jim\u0027s father, and as he watched Jim now he began to feel a new interest in him. Since the death of his brother Johnston he had assumed control of the Kerhill estate. As he studied the worn man who stood in the strong light of the afternoon, dressed in faded and patched riding-breeches, with a flannel shirt, and careless kerchief knotted about his throat, and with roughened hands that showed their service in manual labor, he thought of him as the soldier he had often seen in the London world. But could those be the eyes of a man who was hiding from justice? Again he looked at the slip of paper which was marked, \"Jim Carston, of Carston\u0027s Ranch.\" \n \n Instinctively Jim placed the man who stood before him. Even though he had never seen him before, the resemblance to his brother, Johnston Petrie, was unmistakable. The light began to deepen into crimson shadows, and a stillness hung over the ranch. All the men were away in their quarters, with Big Bill guarding them so that the boss should not be disturbed in what he supposed was a possible chance to sell the place. \n \n Diplomatically, Malcolm Petrie began, \"This is Mr. Carston?\" \n \n \"And you?\" Jim questioned. \n \n Petrie handed him a card as he said, \"Malcolm Petrie, of the firm of Crooks, Petrie \u0026 Petrie, solicitors, London, and at your lordship\u0027s service.\" \n \n Before Jim could speak, Petrie continued: \"Pardon my abruptness in coming on you unawares. Most of the time I allowed myself has been given to locating you.\" \n \n \"Well, Mr. Petrie, go on,\" was all Jim said, as he turned the card in his hand. He hardly knew what course to pursue. Should he deny or acknowledge to this trustworthy man, who was regarding him with such sympathetic interest, that he was Jim Wynnegate? A hunger to learn something of the world he had left, to be allowed to listen longer to the cultivated speech that fell with such beauty on his starved ears, assailed him. \n \n \"Crooks, Petrie \u0026 Petrie have been your family solicitors for so many years that I had hoped to be remembered by your lordship.\" Petrie was determined not to allow this man to escape for a moment from acknowledging his identity, so he pressed him close with his knowledge. \n \n \"Mr. Petrie,\" Jim said, \"we are plain people out here, where every man is as good as every other man—and a good deal better,\" he added, as he remembered the democratic status of the boys. \"So please address me as Mr. Carston. Won\u0027t you be seated?\" As he spoke he pointed to the bench near the hut. \n \n Petrie adjusted his glasses, the better to observe the man, as he said: \"Since you desire it. Only I have come a very long way to inform you that you have a right to the title.\" \n \n The cause of Mr. Petrie\u0027s presence flashed through Jim\u0027s mind. \"Then my cousin—\" \n \n \"Is dead, my lord—Mr. Carston.\" \n \n Monotonously Jim repeated: \"Dead. Henry should have outlived me.\" \n \n \"I am sorry to be the bearer of distressing news, your lordship—\" \n \n But Jim interrupted. \"Don\u0027t humbug, Petrie. There was no love lost between Henry and me, as you know, though I\u0027ve tried to forget that.\" \n \n When he had recovered from the first surprise of this meeting, and had more fully grasped the significance of Petrie\u0027s news, he inquired, \"I suppose Henry left a statement at his death.\" \n \n \"Statement?\" the lawyer inquired. \n \n Jim further explained. \"Something in the nature of a confession.\" \n \n \"Confession?\" \n \n \"By Jove! he might have done that.\" \n \n \"His late lordship died very suddenly.\" \n \n But Jim waited for no further details. \"So he died without a word. He died leaving me a fugitive from justice. So they still think me—\" Then quickly the real facts of the case began to straighten themselves in Jim\u0027s mind. If Henry had not spoken—had left no confession—how and why had Petrie sought him? Then he asked: \n \n \"Why have you come here?\" \n \n Petrie, who was constantly watching the effect of his every word on the man who more and more confused and interested him, slowly answered, \"I am here because your cousin, Lady Kerhill—\" \n \n \"Diana?\" Jim softly breathed the name, but said no more. \n \n Petrie continued: \"Believes that if you will speak—if you will break the silence of years, you can return to England and assume your proper place at the head of your house, and in the world.\" \n \n So it was to Diana he owed this. \"Then there is one who still believes in me. God bless her!\" All restraint fell from Jim as he sat himself beside the solicitor and said, simply, \"I did it for her sake, Petrie.\" Then, as though unconscious of the other man\u0027s presence, he sat staring ahead of him. \n \n His surmise had been right, Petrie thought. This man was not guilty. The case began to assume new interest and new complications. He must hear more. Jim roused himself. From an inside pocket of his shirt he drew a small bag which held a sheet of faded paper. \n \n \"You are familiar with the late Kerhill\u0027s writing. You are also familiar with his character and life. I have never allowed this paper to leave my body.\" As he spoke he handed the paper to Petrie. \"But death has cancelled this agreement.\" \n \n Petrie read the document. Jim sat motionless. As the sun dropped lower and lower towards the west, bolts of scarlet and purple seemed to be hurled from its blazing brilliance down on the cabin and the yard. Petrie broke the silence. \n \n \"So you took upon your shoulders his guilt?\" In his tone there was no great surprise. \n \n \"Not for him, Petrie—for her. It was too late for her to find out—well, what he was.\" The rebellion against the dead man seemed to choke him. Then he added, \"I did it for her sake, Petrie.\" \n \n A restlessness took possession of Jim. All the old memories and sorrows began to lay their withering hands upon him. He crossed to the hitching-post and leaned against it as he watched with unseeing eyes the purple-and-red rays tipping the Uinta peaks. \n \n Petrie read the document again, and as he did so he wondered how much of this Lady Elizabeth had known—how much Diana suspected. He could see now why she had decided to come with him to America. He thought of her as he had seen her a few days ago at Fort Duchesne, of her eyes as she had asked him not to fail in his search, and of her disappointment when her cousin, Sir John Applegate, who accompanied her, had protested against her riding out with Petrie on a venture which might take days, to end only in disappointment. \n \n He went to Jim\u0027s side. \"Lady Kerhill,\" he said, \"will be more grateful than you know, for I am here as her ambassador to beg you to come back home.\" \n \n Into the face of Jim came a wistful longing, so tender and yet so tragic that Petrie turned away from this glimpse into a hurt soul. He only dimly saw the man as he heard Jim\u0027s whispered words: \n \n \"Home, eh? Go back home! By Jove! what that would mean!\" Then, as though a panorama were passing before him of his life on the ranch, he went on: \"And I\u0027ve been away all those awful years in this God-forsaken place.\" There was a break in the low voice and the echo of a sob as Jim turned his back on Petrie. \n \n Again the unlovely surroundings, with their evidences of pinched means, their stamp of neglect through want, impressed the solicitor. Very quietly he said, \"It does look a bit desolate, Mr. Carston.\" \n \n Jim, now master of himself, turned, and as he looked at the dusty plains, the sun-baked cabin, the parched, feverish land about him, cried: \"Desolate! It doesn\u0027t look much like Maudsley Towers, with its parks and turrets, and oaks that go back to William the Conqueror, does it?\" Before his eyes there came a picture of the home of his youth, of the place of his manhood\u0027s joy. The word seemed to burn and tear at him with its possibilities. \"Home, eh? I love old England as only an exile can—\" \n \n He forgot the West, with its disappointments, its scars, and its days of pain, when memories of the past would not be stilled. He came over to Petrie, and in a burst of almost boyish confidence poured out his inmost feelings. \"I love the English ways of doing things\"—laughingly he looked at Petrie, and added—\"even when they\u0027re wrong. The little ceremonies—the respectful servants—the hundred little customs that pad your comfort and nurse your self-respect. Home, eh?\" The word was like a minor chord that he wished to dwell upon, so lovingly did he repeat it. \"Home, eh? And I love old London. I think I am even prepared to like the fogs.\" \n \n Amazed at the change in the man before him, Petrie sat spellbound as Jim jumped to his feet. \n \n \"Do you know what I\u0027ll do when I get back? I\u0027ll ride a week at a time on top of the \u0027buses, up and down the Strand, Piccadilly Circus, Regent Street, Oxford Street. And the crowds!\" Before his excited eyes came the rush, the very smell of the smoky city with its out-pouring of humanity. \"How I love the crowds—the endless crowds! And, Petrie, I\u0027ll go every night to the music-halls, and what\u0027s left of the nights to the clubs—and, by Jove, I\u0027ll come into my own at last!\" \n \n Carried away with the enthusiasm that was inspiring Jim, Petrie entered into the spirit of his joy as he cried, \"The king is dead—long live the king!\" \n \n \"Into my own at last! And I\u0027m still young enough to enjoy life—life—life!\" Into Jim\u0027s slender figure, with its arms out-stretched to the past, which was to be his future, there leaped the fire of immortal youth. It was his moment of supreme exaltation. \n \n Suddenly from the stable door opposite came a glad cry of \"Daddy! daddy!\" as Hal, attracted by the loud voice of Jim, peered from behind the door. Then the child darted across to his father, who still stood with his arms out-stretched to his dream, and clasped his knees. Frightened at the stranger\u0027s presence, Hal quickly buried his face against his father\u0027s body. \n \n The ecstasy faded from Jim\u0027s eyes as the cry of the child brought him back from his dreams to the affairs of earth. Slowly and with infinite tenderness his eyes rested on the bent head of the child. The twilight, which is short in the Green River country, had slipped away, and the angry sun disappeared behind the mountains. Petrie noticed the chill in the air that comes at evening on the plains. \n \n The cry of the child revealed a new phase of the situation. Silently he watched Jim, whose glance went towards the stable. He saw the figure of a beautiful Indian girl emerge, carrying a pail of milk. He saw the shudder that passed over Jim as Nat-u-ritch, unconscious that she was the central figure in a tragic moment, moved slowly before them to the cabin opposite. Her master was busy with the white man, so her eyes were lowered; she did not even call to the child to follow her. Jim\u0027s glance never left her until the door had closed. Then his eyes rested again tenderly on the little head which nestled against him, and a sigh broke from his lips. He stooped and drew the little hand in his as he turned the child towards Malcolm Petrie. The words of his glad dream seemed still filling the air as Jim said: \"Petrie, you\u0027ve come too late. That\u0027s what would have happened; it can never happen now.\" \n \n Gently he urged the child forward as he said; \"Hal, shake hands with Mr. Petrie. This is my son, Petrie.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2048/58390.html","bookId":576,"book":{"id":576,"title":"The Squaw Man","description":"简介： It was Jim\u0027s last day at home.
