{"id":19157,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXV","content":"\"Carston\u0027s locoed. He\u0027s plumb crazy. There can\u0027t be a jail for whites and a palace for Injins. He don\u0027t suppose he can stop me, does he?\" Bud began, excitedly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bill, encouraged by Jim\u0027s mastery of the situation, chaffingly answered: \"After you arrest Nat-u-ritch you\u0027ll never hold office, Bud. You may hold a harp or a coal-shovel.\" Then he laughed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My! You\u0027re making a fuss over a squaw,\" said Bud, who could see no humor in Bill\u0027s words. \\n\\n \\n\\n But Bill replied, \"Arrestin\u0027 the mother of innocent kids will not be considered a popular form of amusement around here, Bud.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Kids? What\u0027s that got to do with it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" said Bill. \"The kid\u0027s an influential citizen hereabouts. He\u0027s our long suit, and there ain\u0027t a live thing on the ranch that would let you arrest his rag doll. You couldn\u0027t get away with it, Bud.\" And as though it were his final word on the subject, Bill said, conclusively, \"Better get elected some easier way.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A new idea fermented in Bud\u0027s brain. If he failed in his scheme to bring to trial the murderer of Cash Hawkins, hundreds of men to whom he had blustered and sworn that he would accomplish the deed would no longer believe in him and he would probably lose the election. Why not try to gain some compensation if this must be the case? \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Git our horses ready, Clarke,\" he said and watched his assistant leave the yard. Slowly Bud hitched his foot on a log, and, as though he were about to confer a favor upon Jim, spoke with condescension. \"Mr. Carston takes this too much to heart, Bill. Perhaps we can come to some understanding.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What do you mean?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, he\u0027s come into some money, ain\u0027t he? Of course I might lose this match-safe crossing Red River.\" He lovingly fingered the little bag. Bill drew nearer. \"And I might\"—Bud continued—\"be made independent of the job of sheriff, if it\u0027s worth the boss\u0027s while.\" There was no mistaking the intention of his words. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bud!\" For a moment Bill could say no more. In the past he and Bud had been friends—bar-room friends, it was true—but lately he had begun to suspect much about the Sheriff\u0027s career that was unsavory. Until to-day, however, he had had no proof that Bud could behave like a blackguard. \"Bud,\" he rejoined, \"you\u0027re goin\u0027 to make me lose my temper, and I \u0027ain\u0027t done that for twenty years.\" As he spoke he raised his foot on the log beside Bud\u0027s and in deliberate imitation of him leaned his elbow on his knee while he stared straight into the Sheriff\u0027s face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be foolish,\" Bud began. \"I can put you to a lot of trouble, and I will. I\u0027ll arrest these English people and put \u0027em under bond to appear as witnesses. They were at Maverick that day, and I got my posse ready and waitin\u0027 to obey orders.\" This, he thought, was the final shot to bring Bill to his senses. He waited. \\n\\n \\n\\n With a tolerance that did not hide his contempt, Bill spoke. \"Except for Jim\u0027s orders, I\u0027d throw you off the place. Get agoin\u0027, Bud—get agoin\u0027—and don\u0027t stop to pick flowers.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bud knew that Bill was conveying a threat which, he felt, as he watched his face, it were wiser not to disregard. He walked towards the barn, stopped, ground his teeth, and looked back at Bill; but the big fellow stood motionless and in supreme disgust watched the Sheriff. Bud uttered a low oath, then hurried down to the corral. \\n\\n \\n\\n Still, Bill did not move. He did not hear Diana as she opened the cabin door and, drinking in the fresh morning air, said, \"I feel as though I should suffocate in there.\" Her looks told that something more than the close air of the cabin room was stifling her. As she came from under the porch she saw the immovable figure of the foreman leaning over the log with his head on his hands, watching several men down the road who were mounting horses and preparing to make a start. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, Mr.—\" She paused. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bill turned. He saw she had forgotten his name. \"Bill, miss,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Bill—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But Bill interrupted as he raised his hat. \"Just plain Bill, if you don\u0027t mind—and there ain\u0027t anything too good for you at Red Butte ranch, lady.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Impulsively Diana held out her hand to Bill, who took it. \"Thank you, Bill. It\u0027s good to feel that I\u0027m among friends, because I feel so strange, so bewildered.\" She had learned of the foreman\u0027s devotion to Jim and knew that she could trust him. \"Bill,\" she asked, \"what do they mean by \u0027squaw-man\u0027?\" There was so much she could not say to Jim, so much that had puzzled her, and she longed to unburden her heart to some one. This faithful soul would understand her, and would, perhaps, help her to learn more about Jim and the Indian woman, concerning whose fate she was now growing anxious. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bill seated himself. \"Well, it\u0027s the name some people give a white man who marries an Indian squaw.\" Then quickly he added: \"But I want you to understand, miss, Jim\u0027s respected in spite of the fact he\u0027s a squaw man. He\u0027s lived that down.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course it was a great surprise to us all at first.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Natural it would be, miss. Of course no ordinary white man would have done it. But you mustn\u0027t think any the less of Jim for that, miss.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Quickly Diana answered, in sympathetic accord with Bill\u0027s loyalty to his master: \"I think all the more of him, Bill. It\u0027s only another of Jim\u0027s glorious mistakes.\" Then again she thought of the woman. \"I wish I could see her. What is she like?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bill could not understand this interest in Nat-u-ritch. \"Just a squaw,\" he said, indifferently. \"She\u0027s got two ideas, and I guess only two—Hal and Jim.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He liked the little woman, but he could see where she had been a great disadvantage to Jim. \\n\\n \\n\\n But Diana\u0027s voice as she said, \"A mother and a wife—that\u0027s a good deal, Bill,\" made him realize that perhaps he was not doing the Indian girl justice. He could see the tears in Diana\u0027s eyes as she spoke. \"And her boy goes back home with us.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bill rose. \"Kind of tough on yours truly, lady, bein\u0027 as Hal and me are kind of side-partners, but then I got to recollect it\u0027s the best for the kid. That\u0027s about the size of it, ain\u0027t it?\" This time it was Bill who solicited comfort from Diana. The thought of the child\u0027s leaving them had been a difficult proposition for the boys, and they had discussed it long and excitedly when Jim told them the plan the night before. \\n\\n \\n\\n Diana understood. \"It involves a lot of suffering all around, doesn\u0027t it, Bill? But it seems to me Nat-u-ritch gets the worst of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n True to his opinion of the red race, Bill answered, \"She\u0027s an Injin—used to takin\u0027 things as they come,\" and he hardly heard Diana\u0027s words: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Poor little savage!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This lady had appealed to him—why shouldn\u0027t he ask her advice? It was all very well for him to have frightened the Sheriff into leaving the place, all very well to appear sanguine and hopeful while the boss stood near him, but in his heart he knew he was afraid. Something in the shifting, malicious look of Bud Hardy\u0027s eyes as he left the place told Bill that there might still be trouble. Twisting the rim of his big hat nervously, he said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Say, miss, you got a lawyer in your party, \u0027ain\u0027t you?\" Diana turned to listen to him. \"Oh, but pshaw!\" he went on, trying to reassure himself even while he spoke the disquieting words. \"It \u0027ll never get to the lawyer, cause Jim \u0027ll never let him arrest her—never!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Arrest her!\" Diana exclaimed, in surprise. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bill explained. \"Nat-u-ritch. The Sheriff thinks he can prove she killed Cash Hawkins—that day you were at Maverick.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jim had not recalled that incident to Diana last night. He had told her he owed his life to the Indian girl—how and why he had not explained. Eagerly she leaned towards Bill as she cautiously said, \"Why did she kill him?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, if\"—and Bill dwelled on the word—\"if she killed him, she did it to save Jim\u0027s life, and it stands to reason Jim ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to see her suffer for it.\" Then as he saw a troubled look on Diana\u0027s face he regretted the admission of his worries. \"Say, miss, I\u0027m awful glad that you an\u0027 Hal are goin\u0027 to pull your freight, for there\u0027s goin\u0027 to be merry hell around here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He quickly begged her pardon for his involuntary slip, but Diana had hardly noticed it. This would mean new worry for Jim. Then she comforted herself with the thought that perhaps this kind-hearted soul was exaggerating things. Surely, if there were cause for anxiety, Jim would have spoken to her about it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is there nothing that can be done, Bill?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He shook his head. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, is there anything that I can do?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t see how, except to git away as soon\u0027s you can.\" And then he told her of Bud\u0027s proposition to obtain money from Jim, and that the Sheriff was willing to sell his evidence against the Indian girl. \"Why,\" he added, \"I \u0027most kicked him off the place; and Bud will fight, you know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But Diana was only concerned to know whether the Sheriff was safely out of the way. \"You say the Sheriff\u0027s gone?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank Heaven!\" Bill answered. \"And, by-the-bye, just to be more cantankerous, he threatened to hold up you and your party as witnesses; but that wouldn\u0027t be legal, would it?\" As he remembered the boys he added, chuckling, \"It certainly wouldn\u0027t be popular.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Before Diana could reply, Jim interrupted them. Like a restless spirit he had been wandering over the place, from barn to cabin, from Hal\u0027s sleeping-room to the boys\u0027 quarters; accomplishing little and vainly trying to accept the events that had crowded into his life during the last hours. The Sheriff, he felt sure, could easily be managed, but Nat-u-ritch\u0027s disappearance was causing him anxiety. He knew it was a trait in the Indian character to hide away and stoically endure its grief in silence. Every moment he expected her to return. Stronger than all these thoughts was the desire that Diana should go at once, and little Hal with her. This speedy termination would make it easier for them all, he told himself, and then there were matters enough to claim his attention. So he reasoned as he came from the back of the house, where he had been brooding over a valise containing the child\u0027s belongings. As he saw Diana sitting there deep in conversation with Bill, he stood amazed at the simple adaptability that made it possible for her to adjust herself to these primitive belongings and people. Bill was already regarding her as a friend. Then he remembered that he must see Tabywana to tell him of Nat-u-ritch\u0027s disappearance, and arrange a plan with him to help her to evade Bud for several days. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bill, I wish you would get Baco. I have sent for Tabywana, and want Baco to interpret for me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bill\u0027s heavy boots creaked down the corral. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hope you\u0027ve rested well, Diana,\" Jim said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t been to bed, Jim. I\u0027ve been trying to think it all out.\" She rose and came to him. \"Would she be quite impossible at Maudsley Towers?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jim knew she wanted to take up their conversation where it had stopped last night. They had discussed the subject already, and he felt the futility of going over the same arguments. It only tormented him, so he answered, \"Quite.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Diana persisted. \"Couldn\u0027t she be sent to school for a few years?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s too late. That might have been done when she was a child, but now she\u0027s a woman.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And a mother.\" Then hurriedly, as though fearful that she would not have the courage to express to Jim all her concern for Nat-u-ritch, she said, \"Jim, I wonder if we are treating her quite fairly?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hope so.\" And in Jim\u0027s voice there was a prayer. \\n\\n \\n\\n During the night many thoughts had haunted Diana. The soft little arms that had clung to her the night before troubled her. What would their loss mean to this child-woman of the woods? She decided to make one more appeal to Jim and frankly lay before him the conflicting emotions that had torn her since her arrival at the ranch. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"At first, Jim, I hated everybody, then I pitied you. Now I am thinking of her.\" Jim listened intently. She laid her hand on his arm. \"Civilization has bred in people like you and me many needs and interests. But this helpless child-mother has just her child and you, and we are taking the child away. Oh, have you the right to sacrifice her even for the child?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jim could not argue. He had made his decision when Petrie wrested from him the concession to let the child go to be prepared for the life he had no right to deny him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have done the best I know how, Diana,\" he said, simply. \"We must leave the rest to God,\" and Diana knew that the words were the result of his own bitter struggle and she could no longer doubt their wisdom. \\n\\n \\n\\n She stood silent. Jim looked at her. Of their own love that had endured all these years, neither spoke. It was Jim\u0027s moment of greatest temptation. He longed to say something to her that might express what he felt; but again he conquered himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Will you take Hal?\" was all he said. \"I want you to get away before the heat of the day.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And Diana left him. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2048/58394.html","bookId":576,"book":{"id":576,"title":"The Squaw Man","description":"简介： It was Jim\u0027s last day at home.
