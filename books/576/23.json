{"id":19155,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII","content":"Nat-u-ritch, with slow impassiveness, obeyed. She came from the house with hardly a glance at the stranger. She had changed but little; still slender and childish in form, motherhood and the past five years seemed to have left no mark upon her save, perhaps, for a more marked wistfulness of expression, especially when she looked at Jim and the boy. Her life was complete; physical deprivations or disappointments mattered little to her. Taught by Jim the ways of civilization, she tried to apply them to her surroundings, but it seemed to her a waste of the golden hours when she might be following her master instead across the plains or playing with her child. It was almost piteous to see how she controlled the instincts of her savage desire for freedom, and in her primitive way cared for the little cabin so as to please Jim. \n \n Malcolm Petrie noticed at once the difference between Nat-u-ritch and the other Indian women whom he had seen during the past days, and was impressed by it. \n \n Hal, at sight of his mother, quickly responded to her out-stretched hand. \n \n \"Nat-u-ritch, this is my te-guin—my friend,\" and Jim indicated Petrie. She inclined her head to the solicitor and said, \"How?\" As her eyes met Petrie\u0027s shrewd glance an instinctive apprehension caused her to tighten her arm about the child. \n \n \"Te-guin—big chief from out yonder—over the big water,\" Jim explained, but her unflinching gaze made it difficult for him to go on. He whispered to Petrie: \"I don\u0027t know how to do it—-I don\u0027t know how to do it.\" Then he summoned all his courage, and with a forced smile said, pleasantly, as though humoring a child, \"Nat-u-ritch, te-guin—big chief—come for little Hal.\" \n \n She flung her arms about the sturdy little fellow, and a sharp exclamation was her only answer. \n \n \"Pretty soon make Hal big chief. Touge wayno—te-guin—good friend—take Hal long way off.\" A shudder ran through her. She began to grasp what the stranger\u0027s presence meant. He was of her boy\u0027s father\u0027s race, and for too long she had forgotten, what in the beginning had so often troubled her, that Jim would some day want to return to his own people. This had been her great fear, but his kindness all these years had lulled to rest that ache of the early days. \n \n While these thoughts tormented her, she could hear Jim still explaining. \"Long trail, heap long trail—over mountains, heap big mountains—Washington.\" \n \n She slipped the child to the other side of her, that he might be farther away from the silent man who was bringing this woe to her, and her clutch grew tighter at the word \"Washington.\" Jim explained to Petrie, \"Washington means a lot to them.\" Then he came closer to Nat-u-ritch as he said, impressively: \n \n \"Big Father—send for little Hal. Say make him big chief—te-guin cross wide water—heap big boat—Hal see the rising sun. Pretty soon, some day, Hal heap wickyup—heap cattle—heap ponies—pretty soon heap big chief.\" \n \n He waited the result of his words. He thought to appeal to her pride and ambition for the boy; but she only shook her head and gazed at him like an affrighted animal whose young is about to be torn from her. \n \n Jim\u0027s fortitude began to desert him. \"She doesn\u0027t understand. She can\u0027t—she can\u0027t,\" he almost moaned, as he turned away, while his clinched hands and the stiffening of his body showed the strain that was proving almost too great for him. \"This is a hard business, Mr. Petrie,\" and Petrie could feel the vibrant emotion of these two victims of fate. As Jim moved a step away, Nat-u-ritch, still holding the boy, started forward and caught his arm as though to hold him back. Her mind was in a daze—she could utter no word; but Jim understood the pantomime. \n \n \"She thinks I\u0027m going, too,\" he said, and hastened to explain away her anxiety. \n \n \"No, Nat-u-ritch—Jim stay here always with you.\" Something of her agony was relieved and she loosed her hold on him. \"Always with you,\" Jim repeated tenderly, looking into the tragic eyes as she eagerly followed every word. \"Only little Hal.\" \n \n As Nat-u-ritch fully grasped the meaning of the words, there broke from her lips the one English word \"No!\" which rang out on the evening air with a wild, dry sob of protest. It was the anguished cry of universal motherhood. The Indian woman sank on her knees, with her arms about the boy, her face buried on his breast. The crouching figure betrayed the old savage instinct of the female covering her young from the ruthless hand that would snatch it from her. \n \n This time both men turned away. A purple gray light fell over the yard, the last traces of the sun\u0027s glory disappeared, and the air grew chilly. \n \n Jim was the first to speak. Kindly, but as a master who must have obedience, he said; \"Nat-u-ritch, I have taken counsel. My heart is good. My word is wise. I have spoken. Go.\" He gently disengaged the boy from her grasp. Nat-u-ritch looked long into Jim\u0027s eyes, and as she met his immovable determination, without a struggle, and with a calmness terrible to see, she released the child. \n \n Jim lifted her to her feet. With her big, stricken eyes still fastened on him, she stood silent for a moment; then the bent, half-stumbling figure slunk past him. Jim dared not watch Nat-u-ritch, though he could hear her heavy breathing and the flapping of her beaded robe against the ground as she crossed to the stable. Once Petrie saw her sway, but she had steadied herself before he could reach her. As she reached the corral she stopped, and, turning, flung out her arms in appeal to Jim; but his back was towards her, the child hidden in his embrace. Then he heard the quick patter of her feet as she fled out into the night—away from these aliens, back to the hills to abandon herself to her grief. \n \n As Jim rose he resolved that when the boy had gone he would try to make her understand that this sacrifice was forced upon them, that for the child\u0027s sake they must both bear it, and in the future she should receive even greater care and comfort from him. \n \n \"This is harder on her than on me, Petrie,\" he said, as he lifted Hal up on the bench and knelt beside him. \n \n \"Where is she going?\" Petrie asked, as he walked towards the corral behind which she had disappeared. \n \n \"Out into the hills to fight it out alone. Mr. Petrie, this is going to be hard on the boy, too. He is a shy little prairie bird and has been a great pet.\" \n \n He was thinking that perhaps he could arrange to let Nat-u-ritch have the boy a little longer and keep Petrie with them awhile. \"It would be rough on him to leave us all so suddenly and go away with a perfect stranger. Can\u0027t you stay here a week or two to let him get used to you?\" Jim proposed. \"By that time you will have won his confidence.\" \n \n Petrie answered, \"I am sorry, but that is impossible. I have overstayed my time some weeks. I left important business interests in London to undertake this mission, and I must return at once.\" \n \n \"But,\" Jim pleaded, \"It can\u0027t be as bad as that. Well, then, only a week.\" \n \n \"I am sorry, but I have already used up all the time I can spare, in finding you. If the boy goes with me it must be now.\" Petrie knew that Diana was waiting for Jim\u0027s arrival; he must reach her with the news as soon as possible. Every hour was of moment to them. She had been persistent in her desire to accompany him, and two days had passed since he left her at Fort Duchesne. He feared some complication might arise from her woman\u0027s impatience, and as it was, he would not be able to leave the ranch before daybreak. Night was already beginning to close in on them. \n \n Jim began to realize the wisdom of Petrie\u0027s decision. It would only prolong the agony. He must make it easy for the boy; afterwards—well, afterwards— But he dared not picture the desolation which would be his. \n \n \"Hal, my boy, my darling, I must tell you something. You know you want to be a soldier like the ones you saw at Fort Duchesne. Remember? With the yellow plumes and tassels and swords and things?\" \n \n The boy was growing sleepy, but at these words roused himself and delightedly exclaimed, \"Yes, yes!\" \n \n \"Well, Mr. Petrie is going to make you one.\" Hal looked over in approval at their visitor who was to make his dream come true. \"Only,\" Jim continued, \"you\u0027ll wear a fine red coat instead of a blue one, and Mr. Petrie\u0027s going to make you a big, fine soldier man. So daddy\u0027s going to let you go. Isn\u0027t that fine?\" \n \n \"You, too, daddy?\" the child questioned. \n \n \"No, dear; I can\u0027t go. When you go away there\u0027ll be nobody but me to take care of little momie.\" \n \n \"I won\u0027t go alone,\" Hal protested. \n \n \"Yes, dear, if father wants you to,\" Jim persuaded. \n \n But the child only cried, \"I won\u0027t—I won\u0027t—I won\u0027t!\" as he flung his arms about his father\u0027s neck. \n \n Jim felt it would be useless to argue further now. It was past the boy\u0027s bedtime, so he only said, coaxingly, \"Yes, yes, you will.\" A scheme to help the boy to bear the separation began to formulate in his mind. They should take him away while he was asleep, and he would send Big Bill along with him for a few days if necessary. \n \n \"Now, old man, tell Mr. Petrie good-night.\" \n \n The child did as he was bid. \n \n Quite hopefully Jim went on talking to him as they crossed to the cabin. \"All right. And now daddy will undress you and hear your prayers, and we\u0027ll have our usual romp, and then the sandman will come.\" Then, as the sleepy child, yawning, drooped his head, Jim lifted him in his arms and cried: \"Kiss me, dear. Oh, don\u0027t ever forget your daddy!\" \n \n So engrossed was he that he failed to hear in the distance sounds that told that visitors were arriving at the ranch. But Petrie, who was ever alert, had been aware of the first clatter of the horses\u0027 hoofs, and now turned in the direction from which came Big Bill\u0027s voice, high above all the others, saying: \n \n \"Well, I guess not. Ain\u0027t none of us ever forgot that day at Maverick. My, he\u0027ll be glad to see you!—Mr. Carston,\" he called. \n \n But it was the triumphant call of \"Jim, Jim!\" that made him turn to see Diana. In it was all the hope that had been buried so long—all the loving joy which she meant to lavish on the man whose starved life had been one long sacrifice for her She had imagined this moment—lived it again and again, and now it was hers. \n \n Gracious and beautiful she stood in the dim light, holding out her hands in welcome. Behind her stood Sir John, while Petrie\u0027s face betrayed the surprise that he felt, although he knew he had been fearing such an occurrence. Jim saw them all. One hand still kept its hold on the child, who at the voices had hidden behind his father; he raised the other to his head. He simply spoke the name \"Diana.\" \n \n \"Why, Jim, I don\u0027t believe you\u0027re glad to see us!\" Diana cried, as he made no attempt to take her hand. \n \n \"Oh yes,\" he answered. \"I\u0027m dazed, Diana—dazed.\" Then he turned in appeal to Malcolm Petrie. \"Petrie?\" he questioned. It would have been too cruel if this had taken place with Petrie\u0027s knowledge, but he could not doubt the truth of the solicitor\u0027s words. \n \n \"This is as much of a surprise to me as it is to you, Mr. Carston.\" \n \n Diana smiled at Petrie. She had taken her own way in spite of his and Sir John\u0027s remonstrance. But they could not understand her—Jim would. What did they know of the Fairies\u0027 Corner—of the long torment she and Jim had shared? \n \n \"We simply couldn\u0027t wait any longer, Jim. We\u0027ve come to take you home—you\u0027ll come home now, Jim, won\u0027t you? Come home?\" And as she spoke she meant all that the word implied in its completeness. She was suing Jim to let her give him all that he had desired in the long ago. \n \n \"Home—home,\" Jim repeated. Was he always to be tortured by what he never could have? His eyes fell on Hal, who was peering out from behind him. As Diana saw the tiny figure in its strange garments, she involuntarily exclaimed: \n \n \"Oh, what a dear boy!\" \n \n The child stared at her. \n \n Smiling, she knelt before him. \"Whose little boy are you, dear?\" she asked. \n \n Hal glanced at his father and his look said, \"Shall I go to the strange lady?\" Jim nodded his head. Shyly the child advanced towards her. \"Jim\u0027s boy,\" he said. \n \n Diana was holding the child\u0027s hands in hers. At the words she lifted her face to Jim and mechanically repeated, \"Jim\u0027s boy?\" Then she looked from the dark head, with its curious foreign beauty, up to the man who stood there with blanched face and sorrow-stricken eyes. Gradually she began to comprehend the meaning of the boy\u0027s words. Again she mutely questioned Jim. \n \n He came to the boy and laid his hands on the little fellow\u0027s head. \"Yes, Diana. My boy—my son.\" \n \n She had dropped the child\u0027s hands at his first word. She looked about her, but everything was dim and ghostly in the dim light. She felt the child\u0027s hand on her sleeve. She could see only Jim\u0027s eyes in the boy\u0027s face inquiringly regarding her. Above him, Jim still stood, silent and constrained. Petrie and Sir John, with Big Bill, had left them. Only a moment did she waver, then with a quick, impetuous cry she caught the boy to her heart, and in that cry was expressed all the starved maternity of her barren life. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2048/58392.html","bookId":576,"book":{"id":576,"title":"The Squaw Man","description":"简介： It was Jim\u0027s last day at home.
