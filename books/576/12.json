{"id":19144,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XII","content":"The clock was striking ten, and Jim was waiting for Henry in the prayer-closet. He had arranged all the details of his departure. It was as though he carried a dead soul, so calm and void had been his feelings for the past hours. He had stayed away from the dinner-party on some pretext, and his man had already started for London with his luggage to be left at his club. When the servant returned the following morning, as he supposed to accompany his master back to town, he would find him gone. By the time the discovery of the deficit was made, Jim would be aboard the steamer that was to carry him across the Atlantic. \n \n Sounds from the drawing-room told him that dinner was over. He sat twirling his travelling hat; on a chair near by lay his coat. The chimes of the last notes of the church-bell were dying away as Henry hurriedly entered. Jim looked up and studied his cousin\u0027s face, and he saw by his manner that some word of hope must have reached him from Lady Elizabeth. Save for a half-suppressed exclamation from Henry as he noticed Jim\u0027s travelling clothes, neither of the men spoke. Henry flung himself into a chair; he could feel Jim\u0027s eyes on his face. \n \n \"Damn it, why don\u0027t you speak?\" he finally gasped, when he could no longer endure the situation. \n \n Jim quietly asked, \"Have you made your peace with Diana?\" \n \n \"What would be the use now?\" He knew that his mother had told Jim the truth. Why did Jim not refer to it? Perhaps there was, as his mother suggested, a way out of this; if so, why in Heaven\u0027s name should the torture be continued. But Jim remained silent. \"You think of nothing but Diana—Diana—Diana.\" With the last call of her name it became a wail. Henry had learned during the past hours what suffering could mean—he was beginning to know what life tempered with discipline might have meant for him. \"When I stand dishonored before the world, it will be easy for you to take her from me. Is that what you are thinking?\" He began excitedly to pace the room. \n \n \"Not exactly,\" Jim answered, without moving from his bent position; \"I was wondering whether you can be trusted with Diana\u0027s future. I believe you love her after a fashion.\" \n \n Henry stopped in his walk in front of Jim. \"And I know that you love her.\" \n \n Jim moved from the position that told how spent he was, and raised himself to his cousin\u0027s height. \"Yes,\" he said, \"but not quite in the way you mean. I am about to show you how I love her.\" \n \n Something in the simple directness of his words made Henry lower his eyes. He threw himself into a chair and with averted head listened to what his cousin had to say. \n \n \"It\u0027s too late for Diana to find out what a blackguard you are, Henry.\" Henry only dropped his head lower on his hands. \"I wonder if you will enter into an honest conspiracy to keep her in happy ignorance to the end,\" Jim continued. \n \n \"What are you driving at?\" Henry asked. He almost knew the words that were to follow, but he hardly dared believe that what he surmised could be true. \n \n \"I am thinking that under certain conditions I will disappear—leave England; as secretary of the Fund my action would be practically a confession of guilt.\" \n \n Jim could hardly hear the strained question that followed. \n \n \"Your conditions?\" \n \n \"That you give up gambling of every kind; that you drop your mistress, shut up her establishment, and give up your other liaisons for good and all; that you make a will leaving everything you have, except what is entailed, to Diana; and that you give me a written and signed confession that you embezzled this money; that for the above considerations I consented to assume the appearance and responsibility of the guilt, and that if you do not keep the agreement you have made with me, I am at liberty to appear at any time and make known the truth.\" \n \n Henry rose and stood looking silently at Jim. Vaguely he began to grasp the tremendous power of Jim\u0027s loyal love. He could find no word—the clock chimed the quarter-hour. \n \n \"Well?\" Jim asked. \n \n \"It\u0027s for her, Jim—for her—I understand that, and I\u0027ll try and have the future make up for the past, so that you\u0027ll never regret this.\" His voice broke—he leaned towards Jim and tried to grope for the hands that he could not see—\"I was a dog to say what I did, but, by God! I\u0027ll keep my part of the agreement.\" \n \n Jim nodded—he was beyond emotion. \"Good; it\u0027s a bargain. Go to your room, make out a paper such as I have indicated, sign it and bring it to me here. Be quick,\" he added, \"and I\u0027ll get away at once.\" \n \n This time it was Jim who dropped into a chair and averted his head to avoid seeing Henry\u0027s out-stretched, pleading hand. He never raised his eyes until he heard the door click, then he went and unlocked a side entrance that led from the prayer-closet to the other side of the garden, and with his watch in his hand leaned against the open door and waited. Henry must not be too long; he was to leave by the midnight train, but before that he must make his pilgrimage. Across the garden he could see the waving tree-tops beckoning him, calling him with the mysterious powers of the night. Yes, he would make his start for the new life from the Fairies\u0027 Corner that led—whither? \n \n Towards the carriage-drive Diana tenderly assisted Sir Charles, followed by Bates. \n \n \"Must you really go, father?\" \n \n \"Yes, my dear, I must keep good hours, you know. These two days have been a great dissipation for me; but I\u0027ve been well repaid; I can\u0027t tell you how much the delightful episode of the loving-cup pleased me. So now, good-night, my love.\" They had reached the entrance, \"No, no,\" Sir Charles protested as Diana started to walk to the carriage with him, \"Bates will take care of me.\" Then he gathered her close in his frail arms as he kissed her, and whispered, full of the pride he felt in the honors done to the house of Kerhill, \"You see, it was all for the best, my dear—all for the best.\" And Diana made no answer. Ever since she had sent the note to Jim revealing the truth of her tortured heart she had seemed to gain a spiritual strength that helped to calm the aching call of her senses. She dared ask no question concerning Jim\u0027s absence, and her heart mocked her again with the truth that she had not meant him to obey her so implicitly. \n \n She saw Sir Charles drive away. \"Dear father,\" she whispered, \"he must never know—never know—but it was all for the worst, my dear, all for the worst.\" Tears began to stain her face; they were the first in many days. She tried to control the passion of her grief but it was impossible; quivering sobs shook her in an hysterical outburst. To escape from the possible eyes of any chance meeting she quickly sought refuge in the rose-arbor. Hidden completely, she gave herself up to the relaxation of her sorrow. Finally, spent with her tears, she leaned against the damp foliage of the rose-screen, and an aftermath of calm followed her outburst. Suddenly she became conscious that Sir John Applegate and Mr. Chiswick were crossing to a bench near the sundial. \n \n \"My dear Chiswick,\" her cousin John was saying, \"I\u0027m greatly distressed. I\u0027ve been obliged to ask you to give me a few moments here, and, indeed, I\u0027ve asked Lady Elizabeth—as Kerhill seemed so ill to-day—to join us here.\" \n \n Diana could distinctly hear every word, but with her tear-stained face it was impossible for her to make known her presence. \n \n \"You see, Chiswick,\" Sir John continued, \"I presume that as Lord Kerhill\u0027s secretary you had his accounts in such shape that we could go over them at a moment\u0027s notice. When the keys were sent me this evening I gave an hour to glancing over the accounts before meeting the auditing committee to-morrow; as I\u0027ve just told you, they seemed in a frightful tangle, and—\" \n \n \"But, as I explained a moment ago, Sir John,\" Chiswick interrupted, \"I really know nothing about the Fund; it was a pleasure for the Earl to do all the work—a labor of love—and he took the matter quite out of my hands. Captain Wynnegate, as secretary of the Fund, and Lord Kerhill have had absolute control of the business side of it.\" \n \n \"What you tell me amazes me; but no doubt there is an explanation which we will have from Kerhill later.\" \n \n An intangible presentiment began to fasten its web about Diana. Lady Elizabeth came from the house; both men rose, and Diana watched eagerly. \n \n \"Lady Elizabeth, believe me I\u0027m exceedingly sorry to trouble you, but—\" then Sir John Applegate quite brusquely said: \"I\u0027ve had the books for the Fund\u0027s accounts, and there is, I\u0027m afraid, trouble ahead for our Yeomanry. Lord Kerhill seems ill from overwork with the troops, so I\u0027ve hesitated to trouble him to-night.\" \n \n Lady Elizabeth\u0027s brows contracted; so it had come so soon. She must act at once—why not? Jim had agreed: perhaps he had already gone—everything was at stake—one small misstep might prove fatal—how far dared she venture? \n \n \"What you tell me comes to me as no great surprise,\" she said. Both men drew nearer to her, Diana strained to hear the low words. \"The cause of Kerhill\u0027s indisposition this afternoon was due to this sudden discovery on his part. Need I say, as Captain Wynnegate had charge of the books, what it means to Henry? He and his cousin are alone responsible, so my son feels that the honor of our house is involved. To-morrow he intended to lay the case before you; he will. I only ask that to-night you will keep the matter quiet until our guests have departed. Perhaps, after all, an investigation will prove quite satisfactory and the shortage may be adjusted.\" She spoke more directly to Sir John; Chiswick, after all, could do little harm. \"Indeed, I feel it is in all probability a mistake, the result of overtired nerves.\" Sir John listened, he had a great respect for Elizabeth, Countess of Kerhill; seriously he answered: \n \n \"I feel anxious, but you may rely absolutely on me. In the morning I must see Henry—will you tell him to meet me with Captain Wynnegate? The matter must be laid before the committee; there may be a leakage in some out-of-the-way corner of another department.\" Lady Elizabeth acquiesced. Sir John went on, \"I could only find confusion in the books; consequently, I feel we need not be too seriously alarmed. By-the-way, where is Captain Wynnegate?\" Lady Elizabeth shook her head. Into both the men\u0027s faces came a look of curious surprise. \n \n \"He has not been seen the entire day, save for a little while quite early, in his tent.\" Diana could feel the condemnation in the silence that followed. \n \n \"Mr. Chiswick, Mr. Chiswick,\" it was Mabel\u0027s voice calling from the open casement. \"You promised to come back for the charades.\" \n \n \"Yes, you must both return—they will need you. And, after all,\" Lady Elizabeth whispered as they started for the house, \"we have no doubt been anticipating difficulties that do not exist.\" \n \n The voices died away, and Diana left the rose-bower. She had but one thought—she must find Jim at once. Why, oh, why, had she written the note of the morning? She stumbled across the heavy, thick sward. In the distance she could see a figure; it looked like Jim\u0027s; he was coming from the Fairies\u0027 Corner over the green to the entrance which in the morning had let her out on to the purple moor. Quickly she hurried to him, staining her gown and delicate slippers in the wet grass. \n \n \"Jim, Jim,\" she called, \"where are you going?\" As he turned she came close to him and repeated her question. \n \n \"I\u0027m taking your advice, Diana; I\u0027m leaving England—\" \n \n \"Oh no, no,\" she eagerly interrupted, \"I thought so, but now you must stay—stay to protect your honor. I\u0027ve just heard that the Fund—oh, it\u0027s not you, I know, Jim, it\u0027s not you—not you—you couldn\u0027t be—\" her despairing cry stopped. Still he made no effort to comfort her. \n \n Finally he said—\"I must go.\" \n \n What did it mean? That he should go after the revelation she had made to him—she understood that; but now with his honor at stake it was different. Into her mind there flashed an unanswerable suspicion. Was there some reason why he had so eagerly acceded to her request; that even now, when she asked him to remain, he still stood mute at her entreaties? \n \n \"Whether you go or stay, Jim, I do not expect ever to see you alone again, and I\u0027m glad of this chance to bid you good-bye—forever. I can never, never believe that you are—Jim, if your hands are clean, if you haven\u0027t robbed the soldiers\u0027 widows and orphans, you may kiss me good-bye.\" \n \n Into his eyes came the desire of his love as she had seen it in the early morning in the Fairies\u0027 Corner. This time she did not move; but Jim only bent low over the out-stretched arms as he answered, \"I must go,\" and went away from her. \n \n The circle of his boyhood was complete. Again he went along the same lane that he had travelled ten years before; again the desolation brought by his departure from his home, his country, hurt and bruised his spirit. Instead of the dawn, it was midnight, with clouds sweeping sinisterly over the light of the heavens, and instead of a boy\u0027s optimism he carried a man\u0027s disillusions. \n \n From the park the light of the tent fires sent out flames that illumined the roadway, the swaying and rustling of the heavy trees made whispering sounds. Once at a turning he heard a boy\u0027s voice in the camp ringing out high above the moaning of the trees: \n \n \"Oh, Tommy, Tommy Atkins, you\u0027re a good \u0027un, \u0027eart and \u0027and, \n You\u0027re a credit to your country and to all your native land.\" \n \n \n He clutched his arms about his head to deaden the sound and hurried on out into the roadway, stumbling and half-falling over the gnarled roots of the ancient trees. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2048/58381.html","bookId":576,"book":{"id":576,"title":"The Squaw Man","description":"简介： It was Jim\u0027s last day at home.
