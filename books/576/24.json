{"id":19156,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV","content":"Jim and Diana sat late into the night while she listened to the story of his life in the West. Urged by Sir John, it was arranged that she should leave the ranch the following day. Bitter as was her disappointment, Diana accepted it without comment. Now her concern was chiefly for the boy, and she eagerly awaited Nat-u-ritch\u0027s return, hoping she might help the little woman to see the wisdom of making this sacrifice for her child\u0027s advantage. Down the hills towards midnight Nat-u-ritch stole, an elf-like creature, with her clinking, beaded robe gleaming in the moonlight. Past the men\u0027s dwelling she went, and on to the cabin for a last sight of her sleeping boy. From his spying-ground Bill saw her, but made no effort to detain her. He knew that the arrival of Jim\u0027s kinsmen had caused a strange turmoil in his life, and made him forget that Bud Hardy might still prove a menace to him. So Bill kept his faithful vigil; but once fatigue caught him and he closed his tired eyes for a brief space. It was just the moment that Kid Clarke, the Sheriff\u0027s watcher, had been waiting for. Unobserved, he slipped away to follow the trail that Nat-u-ritch had taken when she fled from the house in the afternoon. Bud Hardy had cautioned him not to lose sight of the squaw, and to report to him in the early dawn at the cabin. Like Bill, he saw Nat-u-ritch make her way to the cabin and saw her return; then, as he felt secure that she was safely out of the way, he lay in the loft near the cabin and waited for Bud. But Nat-u-ritch had not succeeded in seeing her child. As she peered into the windows of the cabin she saw a beautiful woman and another stranger seated near Jim. For a long time she watched him as he talked to the woman, who now and then went to the door of the room in which the child lay, and listened as though afraid that their voices might disturb the boy. The woman\u0027s presence became an added complication in the impending tragedy that engulfed Nat-u-ritch. She longed to creep into the room and kneel beside Jim, to beg to be allowed just to be near him; but she was afraid—afraid of the curious glances of the strangers. Intently she watched the woman and saw the look on Jim\u0027s face as he talked long and earnestly to her. How he had changed! She remembered him as the young, strong, handsome buck whom she had met at the bear-dance. For the first time she seemed to see the whitened hair, the tired, patient eyes, and the marks of sorrow on his face. Once she saw him lean forward and gently argue with the white woman. She dimly understood the difference between his attitude towards this woman of his own race and to her. Gradually a new pain was added to the hurt that tried her endurance; she could not explain it, but Jim had never looked at her like that. He treated her as he did little Hal, while he regarded the woman with him as his equal. She began to sob piteously, like a child who is suddenly asked to face something it cannot understand. It was useless to remain there longer. Back she hurried to the hills, more desolate than when she started to see her child. Through the long hours that followed she made no effort to reason or to control her emotions, but abandoned herself to her grief. Just before daylight Tabywana crept silently along the road and hid behind the wagon that stood near the house. He had been following Bud Hardy, whose early visit to the cabin had aroused his suspicions. Although Jim had dismissed his advice yesterday, the Chief was determined to see him again as soon as daylight should come. He was impatient to disclose to Jim the fear that tormented him for Nat-u-ritch\u0027s safety. As he watched for the first faint streaks of dawn, from his hiding-place Tabywana saw Bud Hardy emerge from the men\u0027s quarters and steal towards the cabin. Bud tiptoed about the place, then crossed to the loft and gave three short whistles. Almost immediately Kid Clarke appeared and leaned out of the loft door. \"Well?\" Bud called, as Clarke, dazed, rubbed his sleepy eyes. \"Nat-u-ritch has disappeared—her trail leads to the hills. Carston hasn\u0027t been to bed at all. He went away about half an hour ago.\" Bud glanced quickly about the place. \"No one in the room, then?\" Kid nodded. \"All right—come down,\" Bud said. Kid disappeared from the aperture in the loft and Bud went softly into the house. Silently the Chief slid down under the porch of the cabin. As Bud came out of the house he saw in the Sheriff\u0027s hand a small thirty-two-caliber revolver which he was smilingly examining. Before he could pocket the weapon Tabywana leaped upon him and clutched the hand that held the gun, but Bud, with a muttered imprecation, deftly threw the hand with the revolver over Tabywana\u0027s shoulder, but only to feel an iron fist beat his knuckles. Involuntarily he loosened his hold and heard Bill\u0027s voice say: \"Put up your gun, Clarke.\" Kid had reached there just at the end of the struggle, and had started to pull his revolver to assist Bud. Holding the captured revolver in his hand, Bill said: \"Why, what\u0027s the matter, boys? I don\u0027t allow no gun-play on this ranch—not while I\u0027m foreman of it.\" In the first faint light of the rising sun the three figures were like ghostly silhouettes against the gray background. \"I want that gun,\" Bud replied. \"How did you come by it?\" Bill demanded. Before Bud Hardy could speak, Tabywana grasped Bill by the arm and by pantomime indicated that Bud had crept into the house and stolen it. Bill turned sternly to Bud. \"What do you mean by sneakin\u0027 into other peoples\u0027 houses at night an\u0027 takin\u0027 their property? Why\"—as he examined the revolver—-\"this gun belongs to Nat-u-ritch.\" Almost savagely Bud interposed: \"Oh, it does, does it? You heard that, Clarke? Well, that\u0027s all I want to know.\" Bill saw that Bud had gained evidence against the little woman. \"Well, it ain\u0027t all I want to know. You\u0027ll have to show me, Bud—you\u0027ll have to show me why you\u0027re combinin\u0027 the trades of burglar an\u0027 sheriff.\" Then, with a change in his voice, he said, \"Better sit down and we\u0027ll discuss this amicable.\" Bud seated himself near Clarke and Bill; Tabywana remained standing near them, eagerly trying to grasp all that was being said. Bud was not averse to taking Bill into his confidence. He felt that with Clarke as a witness to Bill\u0027s statement he had gained the essential point his case needed. \"You fellers have guyed me for years about Cash Hawkins\u0027s death, \u0027ain\u0027t you? Now it\u0027s my turn.\" So Bud was going to try to make a sensational arrest through Bill, and thus win the county over to him and secure another election to the office of sheriff! Should he call Jim at once, Bill wondered. He determined to wait and see if Bud meant to declare his intentions. \"\u0027YES, DIANA. MY BOY——MY SON\u0027\" See page 257 \"\u0027YES, DIANA. MY BOY——MY SON\u0027\" See page 257 \"Ancient history that, Bud,\" he said, \"Forgotten long ago.\" But Bud answered, \"Not by his friends and relatives about Jansen.\" \"Oh, they\u0027re still looking for somebody to scalp, eh? Better let sleeping dogs lie, Bud.\" Perhaps he could reason the Sheriff out of this scheme; perhaps convince him that it was not a profitable move on his part, and that he would in such case have the other party against him if he ever attempted to use these unfair means. His thoughts were interrupted by Bud, who said, with a knowing look at Clarke, \"You\u0027ll have to hand that gun over to me, Bill.\" \"Will I?\" Bud rose, and with a certain amount of assumed dignity said, \"I demand it in my official capacity.\" As he moved towards Bill he felt Tabywana creeping behind him. Irritated, he turned and faced the Indian as he said, \"Say, we \u0027ain\u0027t got to take Indians into our confidence, have we?\" Bill, who saw that he might accomplish more if left alone with Bud, said, kindly: \"Tabywana, get Baco up, will you? I want him.\" Tabywana knew that he was dismissed, but he trusted Bill, so he only muttered a warning as he started to do his bidding. \"All right, I can take care of myself, Chief.\" Then the Indian left him. \"Come on, Bud, I call you. You got to show me your hand.\" \"Well, if I want an election it\u0027s up to me to make good with Cash\u0027s outfit, ain\u0027t it?\" \"So you\u0027re due for a grandstand play, eh?\" was Bill\u0027s comment. The way events were shaping themselves worried him. These rough-shod political aspirations often led men like Hardy to play to the gallery in order to win a high-handed election. Bud went on, sure that Bill would see the reason of his adventure, \"I have always had the bullet that killed Cash, and that\u0027s been the only clew I\u0027ve ever had.\" Dryly, Bill interrupted. \"It hasn\u0027t led you very far, Bud.\" But Bud did not notice Bill\u0027s remark. Impressively he said: \"It was a thirty-two. Now no man in this country ever carried a toy like that. That\u0027s a woman\u0027s weapon.\" Then slowly pointing to the revolver in Bill\u0027s hand, he said, \"That gun of Nat-u-ritch\u0027s is a thirty-two.\" If this was all the evidence that Bud had, the case was not so serious after all, so, much relieved, Bill said, lightly: \"Bud, you\u0027re a joke. Because Nat-u-ritch happens to own a thirty-two—\" Bud maliciously interposed: \"Don\u0027t be in such a hurry. The last time I was over to Maverick I happens to ask Nick, the barkeep, for a light, and he lets me help myself from a squaw\u0027s beaded match-safe.\" Bud cautiously drew a tiny blue-and-green embroidered bag from his pocket. \"\u0027Hello,\u0027 says I. \u0027Where did you get that?\u0027 \u0027Oh,\u0027 says he, \u0027I\u0027ve had that for years—ever since the day that Cash Hawkins was killed. Found it in front of the side door down there.\u0027 And I bought it of him then and there\"—Bud looked straight into Bill\u0027s eyes as he finished—\"cause I recognized it as one I had tried to buy of Nat-u-ritch.\" But even this statement apparently did not startle Bill, who met Bud\u0027s glance squarely as he said, \"And so you jump at the conclusion that—\" \"Nat-u-ritch killed Cash Hawkins.\" Bud took him up. \"There ain\u0027t a doubt about it. You see that thirty-two is minus just the shot which she done it with.\" Bill paled a little. So Bud had noticed the missing bullet. He knew that since her marriage Nat-u-ritch had never carried the revolver. It had been put away on a shelf to be out of the child\u0027s way. Bud reached his hand towards Bill. \"I\u0027ve shown you my hand fair and square—man to man—now I\u0027ll thank you for that gun.\" But Bill, who caught sight of Jim coming through the corral, said, \"That\u0027s up to Mr. Carston, and here he is.\" Bud turned sharply. He would have preferred to meet Jim some other time, but it was too late to retreat now. Bill went to Jim. \"Hello,\" he said. He decided to blurt out the whole affair to Jim at once. He knew then that the squaw would be safe; the boss would see to that. \"Mr. Carston,\" he began, \"our amusin\u0027 little friend over there is a-contemplatin\u0027 of arrestin\u0027 Nat-u-ritch for the killin\u0027 of Cash Hawkins.\" \"Oh no; you must be joking,\" Jim said to Bud, too worn out to give vent to the anger that began to surge through him. Bill was relieved at the light manner in which Jim seemed to take the news. \"Well, that\u0027s what I thought, but he takes himself kind of serious.\" Furiously came Bud\u0027s next words. \"Anyway, I\u0027ve got evidence to arrest her.\" Showing the revolver to Jim, Bill contemptuously added, \"And which said Sheriff steals out of the house of said trustin\u0027 and confidin\u0027 friend.\" Jim stared in amazement at the revolver. Yes, it was Nat-u-ritch\u0027s. He had never looked at it since that day at Maverick when her hand had saved him from the cowardly attack of Cash Hawkins. He did not speak. Bud moved closer to him. He pointed to Bill. \"And which he said belonged to Nat-u-ritch.\" Triumphantly he pointed also to Clarke to indicate that he had him as a witness. Jim motioned Bill to the house. \"Put that revolver back where it belongs,\" he said, and Bill obeyed. Bud darted forward as though to stop Bill. \"I demand the custody of that myself, Mr. Carston.\" \"Let\u0027s understand each other, Sheriff.\" As he spoke, Jim deliberately blocked Bud\u0027s way. \"Nat-u-ritch is as innocent of wrong as a bird that flies. It wouldn\u0027t do to confine her in that dirty little jail in Jansen. It would be murder.\" \"You\u0027re a law-abiding citizen, Mr. Carston. You ain\u0027t agoin\u0027 to resist the law?\" But Jim stood firm in front of the cabin door. \"There are cases, Sheriff, where justice is superior to the law, and the white man\u0027s court is a bad place for justice to the Indian. Fortunately for all of us, Nat-u-ritch has disappeared.\" As Jim spoke, Bud realized that if the Indian woman were there Carston would not be so calm. \"But you couldn\u0027t arrest her, Sheriff—not while I live. Bill\"—he turned to the foreman, who came out of the house—\"I\u0027m not in a mood to discuss this with Sheriff Hardy, and I don\u0027t want to violate the laws of hospitality. But just one word, Sheriff—you\u0027ve eaten my bread, slept under my roof, and now you sneak into my house to get evidence against the mother of my boy.\" Jim hesitated, and then as he left them he quietly finished, \"Bill, I think you\u0027d better see the Sheriff safely on his way.\" And Bud knew that for the time being he had lost his game.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2048/58393.html","bookId":576,"book":{"id":576,"title":"The Squaw Man","description":"简介： It was Jim\u0027s last day at home.
