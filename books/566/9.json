{"id":17707,"no":9,"title":"THE LADY OF GOLLERUS By Crofton Croker","content":"On the shore of Smerwick harbour, one fine summer\u0027s morning, just at daybreak, stood Dick Fitzgerald \u0027shoghing the dudeen,\u0027 which may be translated, smoking his pipe. The sun was gradually rising behind the lofty Brandon, the dark sea was getting green in the light, and the mists clearing away out of the valleys went rolling and curling like the smoke from the corner of Dick\u0027s mouth. \u0027\u0027Tis just the pattern of a pretty morning,\u0027 said Dick, taking the pipe[78] from between his lips, and looking towards the distant ocean, which lay as still and tranquil as a tomb of polished marble. \u0027Well, to be sure,\u0027 continued he, after a pause, \u0027\u0027tis mighty lonesome to be talking to one\u0027s self by way of company, and not to have another soul to answer one—nothing but the child of one\u0027s own voice, the echo! I know this, that if I had the luck, or may be the misfortune,\u0027 said Dick, with a melancholy smile, \u0027to have the woman, it would not be this way with me! and what in the wide world is a man without a wife? He\u0027s no more surely than a bottle without a drop of drink in it, or dancing without music, or the left leg of a scissors, or a fishing-line without a hook, or any other matter that is no ways complete. Is it not so?\u0027 said Dick Fitzgerald, casting his eyes towards a rock upon the strand, which, though it could not speak, stood up as firm and looked as bold as ever Kerry witness did.[79] But what was his astonishment at beholding, just at the foot of that rock, a beautiful young creature combing her hair, which was of a sea-green colour; and now the salt water shining on it appeared, in the morning light, like melted butter upon cabbage. Dick guessed at once that she was a Merrow,[5] although he had never seen one before, for he spied the cohuleen driuth, or little enchanted cap, which the sea people use for diving down into the ocean, lying upon the strand near her; and he had heard that, if once he could possess himself of the cap she would lose the power of going away into the water: so he seized it with all speed, and she, hearing the noise, turned her head about as natural as any Christian. When the Merrow saw that her little diving-cap was gone, the salt tears—doubly salt, no doubt, from her—came trickling down her cheeks, and [80]she began a low mournful cry with just the tender voice of a new-born infant. Dick, although he knew well enough what she was crying for, determined to keep the cohuleen driuth, let her cry never so much, to see what luck would come out of it. Yet he could not help pitying her; and when the dumb thing looked up in his face, with her cheeks all moist with tears, \u0027twas enough to make any one feel, let alone Dick, who had ever and always, like most of his countrymen, a mighty tender heart of his own. \u0027Don\u0027t cry, my darling,\u0027 said Dick Fitzgerald; but the Merrow, like any bold child, only cried the more for that. Dick sat himself down by her side, and took hold of her hand by way of comforting her. \u0027Twas in no particular an ugly hand, only there was a small web between the fingers, as there is in a duck\u0027s foot; but \u0027twas as thin and as white as the skin between egg and shell.[81] \u0027What\u0027s your name, my darling?\u0027 says Dick, thinking to make her conversant with him; but he got no answer; and he was certain sure now, either that she could not speak, or did not understand him: he therefore squeezed her hand in his, as the only way he had of talking to her. It\u0027s the universal language; and there\u0027s not a woman in the world, be she fish or lady, that does not understand it. The Merrow did not seem much displeased at this mode of conversation; and making an end of her whining all at once, \u0027Man,\u0027 says she, looking up in Dick Fitzgerald\u0027s face; \u0027man, will you eat me?\u0027 \u0027By all the red petticoats and check aprons between Dingle and Tralee,\u0027 cried Dick, jumping up in amazement, \u0027I\u0027d as soon eat myself, my jewel! Is it I eat you, my pet? Now, \u0027twas some ugly ill-looking thief of a fish put that notion into your own pretty head, with the nice green hair down upon it,[82] that is so cleanly combed out this morning!\u0027 \u0027Man,\u0027 said the Merrow, \u0027what will you do with me if you won\u0027t eat me?\u0027 Dick\u0027s thoughts were running on a wife: he saw, at the first glimpse, that she was handsome; but since she spoke, and spoke too like any real woman, he was fairly in love with her. \u0027Twas the neat way she called him man that settled the matter entirely. \u0027Fish,\u0027 says Dick, trying to speak to her after her own short fashion; \u0027fish,\u0027 says he, \u0027here\u0027s my word, fresh and fasting, for you this blessed morning, that I\u0027ll make you Mistress Fitzgerald before all the world, and that\u0027s what I\u0027ll do.\u0027 \u0027Never say the word twice,\u0027 says she; \u0027I\u0027m ready and willing to be yours, Mister Fitzgerald; but stop, if you please, till I twist up my hair.\u0027 It was some time before she had settled it entirely to her liking; for she guessed, I suppose, that she was going among[83] strangers, where she would be looked at. When that was done, the Merrow put the comb in her pocket, and then bent down her head and whispered some words to the water that was close to the foot of the rock. Dick saw the murmur of the words upon the top of the sea, going out towards the wide ocean, just like a breath of wind rippling along, and, says he, in the greatest wonder, \u0027Is it speaking you are, my darling, to the salt water?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s nothing else,\u0027 says she, quite carelessly; \u0027I\u0027m just sending word home to my father not to be waiting breakfast for me; just to keep him from being uneasy in his mind.\u0027 \u0027And who\u0027s your father, my duck?\u0027 said Dick. \u0027What!\u0027 said the Merrow, \u0027did you never hear of my father? he\u0027s the king of the waves to be sure!\u0027 \u0027And yourself, then, is a real king\u0027s daughter?\u0027 said Dick, opening his two[84] eyes to take a full and true survey of his wife that was to be. \u0027Oh, I\u0027m nothing else but a made man with you, and a king your father; to be sure he has all the money that\u0027s down at the bottom of the sea!\u0027 \u0027Money,\u0027 repeated the Merrow, \u0027what\u0027s money?\u0027 \u0027\u0027Tis no bad thing to have when one wants it,\u0027 replied Dick; \u0027and may be now the fishes have the understanding to bring up whatever you bid them?\u0027 \u0027Oh yes,\u0027 said the Merrow, \u0027they bring me what I want.\u0027 \u0027To speak the truth then,\u0027 said Dick, \u0027\u0027tis a straw bed I have at home before you, and that, I\u0027m thinking, is no ways fitting for a king\u0027s daughter; so if \u0027twould not be displeasing to you, just to mention a nice feather bed, with a pair of new blankets—but what am I talking about? may be you have not such things as beds down under the water?\u0027 \u0027By all means,\u0027 said she, \u0027Mr.[85] Fitzgerald—plenty of beds at your service. I\u0027ve fourteen oyster-beds of my own, not to mention one just planting for the rearing of young ones.\u0027 \u0027You have?\u0027 says Dick, scratching his head and looking a little puzzled. \u0027\u0027Tis a feather bed I was speaking of; but, clearly, yours is the very cut of a decent plan to have bed and supper so handy to each other, that a person when they\u0027d have the one need never ask for the other.\u0027 However, bed or no bed, money or no money, Dick Fitzgerald determined to marry the Merrow, and the Merrow had given her consent. Away they went, therefore, across the strand, from Gollerus to Ballinrunnig, where Father Fitzgibbon happened to be that morning. \u0027There are two words to this bargain, Dick Fitzgerald,\u0027 said his Reverence, looking mighty glum. \u0027And is it a fishy woman you\u0027d marry? The Lord preserve us! Send the scaly creature[86] home to her own people; that\u0027s my advice to you, wherever she came from.\u0027 Dick had the cohuleen driuth in his hand, and was about to give it back to the Merrow, who looked covetously at it, but he thought for a moment, and then says he, \u0027Please your Reverence, she\u0027s a king\u0027s daughter.\u0027 \u0027If she was the daughter of fifty kings,\u0027 said Father Fitzgibbon, \u0027I tell you, you can\u0027t marry her, she being a fish.\u0027 \u0027Please your Reverence,\u0027 said Dick again, in an undertone, \u0027she is as mild and as beautiful as the moon.\u0027 \u0027If she was as mild and as beautiful as the sun, moon, and stars, all put together, I tell you, Dick Fitzgerald,\u0027 said the Priest, stamping his right foot, \u0027you can\u0027t marry her, she being a fish.\u0027 \u0027But she has all the gold that\u0027s down in the sea only for the asking, and I\u0027m a made man if I marry her; and,\u0027 said Dick, looking up slily, \u0027I can[87] make it worth any one\u0027s while to do the job.\u0027 \u0027Oh! that alters the case entirely,\u0027 replied the Priest; \u0027why there\u0027s some reason now in what you say: why didn\u0027t you tell me this before? marry her by all means, if she was ten times a fish. Money, you know, is not to be refused in these bad times, and I may as well have the hansel of it as another, that may be would not take half the pains in counselling you that I have done.\u0027 So Father Fitzgibbon married Dick Fitzgerald to the Merrow, and like any loving couple, they returned to Gollerus well pleased with each other. Everything prospered with Dick—he was at the sunny side of the world; the Merrow made the best of wives, and they lived together in the greatest contentment. It was wonderful to see, considering where she had been brought up, how she would busy herself about the house,[88] and how well she nursed the children; for, at the end of three years there were as many young Fitzgeralds—two boys and a girl. In short, Dick was a happy man, and so he might have been to the end of his days if he had only had the sense to take care of what he had got; many another man, however, beside Dick, has not had wit enough to do that. One day, when Dick was obliged to go to Tralee, he left the wife minding the children at home after him, and thinking she had plenty to do without disturbing his fishing-tackle. Dick was no sooner gone than Mrs. Fitzgerald set about cleaning up the house, and chancing to pull down a fishing-net, what should she find behind it in a hole in the wall but her own cohuleen driuth. She took it out and looked at it, and then she thought of her father the king, and her mother the queen, and her brothers and sisters,[89] and she felt a longing to go back to them. She sat down on a little stool and thought over the happy days she had spent under the sea; then she looked at her children, and thought on the love and affection of poor Dick, and how it would break his heart to lose her. \u0027But,\u0027 says she, \u0027he won\u0027t lose me entirely, for I\u0027ll come back to him again, and who can blame me for going to see my father and my mother after being so long away from them?\u0027 She got up and went towards the door, but came back again to look once more at the child that was sleeping in the cradle. She kissed it gently, and as she kissed it a tear trembled for an instant in her eye and then fell on its rosy cheek. She wiped away the tear, and turning to the eldest little girl, told her to take good care of her brothers, and to be a good child herself until she came back. The Merrow then went down to the strand. The[90] sea was lying calm and smooth, just heaving and glittering in the sun, and she thought she heard a faint sweet singing, inviting her to come down. All her old ideas and feelings came flooding over her mind, Dick and her children were at the instant forgotten, and placing the cohuleen driuth on her head she plunged in. Dick came home in the evening, and missing his wife he asked Kathleen, his little girl, what had become of her mother, but she could not tell him. He then inquired of the neighbours, and he learned that she was seen going towards the strand with a strange-looking thing like a cocked hat in her hand. He returned to his cabin to search for the cohuleen driuth. It was gone, and the truth now flashed upon him. Year after year did Dick Fitzgerald wait expecting the return of his wife, but he never saw her more. Dick never married again, always thinking[91] that the Merrow would sooner or later return to him, and nothing could ever persuade him but that her father the king kept her below by main force; \u0027for,\u0027 said Dick, \u0027she surely would not of herself give up her husband and her children.\u0027 While she was with him she was so good a wife in every respect that to this day she is spoken of in the tradition of the country as the pattern for one, under the name of The Lady of Gollerus. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3259/89300.html","bookId":566,"book":{"id":566,"title":"Irish Fairy Tales","description":"简介： I am often doubted when I say that the Irish peasantry still believe in fairies.
