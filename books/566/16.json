He had a wife, and av coorse they had childhre, and small blame to them, and plenty of them, so that the poor little waiver was obleeged to work his fingers to the bone a\u0027most to get them the bit and the sup; but he didn\u0027t begridge that, for he was an industherous craythur, as I said before[196], and it was up airly and down late with him, and the loom never standin\u0027 still. Well, it was one mornin\u0027 that his wife called to him, and he sitting very busy throwin\u0027 the shuttle; and says she, \u0027Come here,\u0027 says she, \u0027jewel, and ate your brekquest, now that it\u0027s ready.\u0027 But he never minded her, but wint an workin\u0027. So in a minit or two more, says she, callin\u0027 out to him agin, \u0027Arrah, lave off slavin\u0027 yourself, my darlin\u0027, and ate your bit o\u0027 brekquest while it is hot.\u0027 \u0027Lave me alone,\u0027 says he, and he dhruv the shuttle fasther nor before. Well, in a little time more, she goes over to him where he sot, and says she, coaxin\u0027 him like, \u0027Thady, dear,\u0027 says she, \u0027the stirabout will be stone cowld if you don\u0027t give over that weary work and come and ate it at wanst.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m busy with a patthern here that is brakin\u0027 my heart,\u0027 says the waiver; \u0027and antil I complate it and masther it intirely I won\u0027t quit.\u0027[197] \u0027Oh, think o\u0027 the iligant stirabout, that \u0027ill be spylte intirely.\u0027 \u0027To the divil with the stirabout,\u0027 says he. \u0027God forgive you,\u0027 says she, \u0027for cursin\u0027 your good brekquest.\u0027 \u0027Ay, and you too,\u0027 says he. \u0027Throth, you\u0027re as cross as two sticks this blessed morning, Thady,\u0027 says the poor wife; \u0027and it\u0027s a heavy handful I have of you when you are cruked in your temper; but stay there if you like, and let your stirabout grow cowld, and not a one o\u0027 me \u0027ill ax you agin;\u0027 and with that off she wint, and the waiver, sure enough, was mighty crabbed, and the more the wife spoke to him the worse he got, which, you know, is only nath\u0027ral. Well, he left the loom at last, and wint over to the stirabout, and what would you think but whin he looked at it, it was as black as a crow; for, you see, it was in the hoighth o\u0027 summer, and the flies lit upon it to that degree that[198] the stirabout was fairly covered with them. \u0027Why, thin, bad luck to your impidence,\u0027 says the waiver; \u0027would no place sarve you but that? and is it spyling my brekquest yiz are, you dirty bastes?\u0027 And with that, bein\u0027 altogether cruked-tempered at the time, he lifted his hand, and he made one great slam at the dish o\u0027 stirabout, and killed no less than three score and tin flies at the one blow. It was three score and tin exactly, for he counted the carcasses one by one, and laid them out on a clane plate, for to view them. Well, he felt a powerful sperit risin\u0027 in him, when he seen the slaughther he done, at one blow; and with that he got as consaited as the very dickens, and not a sthroke more work he\u0027d do that day, but out he wint, and was fractious and impident to every one he met, and was squarin\u0027 up into their faces and sayin\u0027, \u0027Look at that fist![199] that\u0027s the fist that killed three score and tin at one blow—Whoo!\u0027 With that all the neighbours thought he was crack\u0027d, and faith, the poor wife herself thought the same when he kem home in the evenin\u0027, afther spendin\u0027 every rap he had in dhrink, and swaggerin\u0027 about the place, and lookin\u0027 at his hand every minit. \u0027Indeed, an\u0027 your hand is very dirty, sure enough, Thady jewel,\u0027 says the poor wife; and thrue for her, for he rowled into a ditch comin\u0027 home. \u0027You had betther wash it, darlin\u0027.\u0027 \u0027How dar\u0027 you say dirty to the greatest hand in Ireland?\u0027 says he, going to bate her. \u0027Well, it\u0027s nat dirty,\u0027 says she. \u0027It is throwin\u0027 away my time I have been all my life,\u0027 says he; \u0027livin\u0027 with you at all, and stuck at a loom, nothin\u0027 but a poor waiver, when it is Saint George or the Dhraggin I ought to be, which is two of the siven champions o\u0027 Christendom.\u0027[200] \u0027Well, suppose they christened him twice as much,\u0027 says the wife; \u0027sure, what\u0027s that to uz?\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t put in your prate,\u0027 says he; \u0027you ignorant sthrap,\u0027 says he. \u0027You\u0027re vulgar, woman—you\u0027re vulgar—mighty vulgar; but I\u0027ll have nothin\u0027 more to say to any dirty snakin\u0027 thrade again—divil a more waivin\u0027 I\u0027ll do.\u0027 \u0027Oh, Thady dear, and what\u0027ll the children do then?\u0027 \u0027Let them go play marvels,\u0027 says he. \u0027That would be but poor feedin\u0027 for them, Thady.\u0027 \u0027They shan\u0027t want for feedin\u0027,\u0027 says he; \u0027for it\u0027s a rich man I\u0027ll be soon, and a great man too.\u0027 \u0027Usha, but I\u0027m glad to hear it, darlin\u0027,—though I dunna how it\u0027s to be, but I think you had betther go to bed, Thady.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t talk to me of any bed but the bed o\u0027 glory, woman,\u0027 says he, lookin\u0027 mortial grand. \u0027Oh! God send we\u0027ll all be in glory[201] yet,\u0027 says the wife, crassin\u0027 herself; \u0027but go to sleep, Thady, for this present.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll sleep with the brave yit,\u0027 says he. \u0027Indeed, an\u0027 a brave sleep will do you a power o\u0027 good, my darlin\u0027,\u0027says she. \u0027And it\u0027s I that will be the knight!\u0027 says he. \u0027All night, if you plaze, Thady,\u0027 says she. \u0027None o\u0027 your coaxin\u0027,\u0027says he. \u0027I\u0027m detarmined on it, and I\u0027ll set off immediantly, and be a knight arriant.\u0027 \u0027A what?\u0027 says she. \u0027A knight arriant, woman.\u0027 \u0027Lord, be good to me, what\u0027s that?\u0027 says she. \u0027A knight arriant is a rale gintleman,\u0027 says he; \u0027going round the world for sport, with a swoord by his side, takin\u0027 whatever he plazes for himself; and that\u0027s a knight arriant,\u0027 says he. Well, sure enough he wint about among his neighbours the next day, and[202] he got an owld kittle from one, and a saucepan from another; and he took them to the tailor, and he sewed him up a shuit o\u0027 tin clothes like any knight arriant and he borrowed a pot lid, and that he was very partic\u0027lar about, bekase it was his shield and he wint to a frind o\u0027 his, a painther and glazier, and made him paint an his shield in big letthers— \u0027I\u0027M THE MAN OF ALL MIN, THAT KILL\u0027D THREE SCORE AND TIN AT A BLOW.\u0027 \u0027When the people sees that,\u0027 says the waiver to himself, \u0027the sorra one will dar\u0027 for to come near me.\u0027 And with that he towld the wife to scour out the small iron pot for him, \u0027For,\u0027 says he, \u0027it will make an iligant helmet\u0027; and when it was done, he put it an his head, and his wife said, \u0027Oh, murther, Thady jewel, is it puttin\u0027 a great heavy iron pot an your head you are, by way iv a hat?\u0027 \u0027Sartinly,\u0027 says he; \u0027for a knight[203] arraint should always have a woight an his brain.\u0027 \u0027But, Thady dear,\u0027 says the wife, \u0027there\u0027s a hole in it, and it can\u0027t keep out the weather.\u0027 \u0027It will be the cooler,\u0027 says he, puttin\u0027 it an him; \u0027besides, if I don\u0027t like it, it is aisy to stop it with a wisp o\u0027 sthraw, or the like o\u0027 that.\u0027 \u0027The three legs of it looks mighty quare, stickin\u0027 up,\u0027 says she. \u0027Every helmet has a spike stickin\u0027 out o\u0027 the top of it,\u0027 says the waiver; \u0027and if mine has three, it\u0027s only the grandher it is.\u0027 \u0027Well,\u0027 says the wife, getting bitther at last, \u0027all I can say is, it isn\u0027t the first sheep\u0027s head was dhress\u0027d in it.\u0027 \u0027Your sarvint, ma\u0027am,\u0027 says he; and off he set. Well, he was in want of a horse, and so he wint to a field hard by, where the miller\u0027s horse was grazin\u0027, that used to carry the ground corn round the counthry.[204] \u0027This is the idintical horse for me,\u0027 says the waiver; \u0027he is used to carryin\u0027 flour and male, and what am I but the flower o\u0027 shovelry in a coat o\u0027 mail; so that the horse won\u0027t be put out iv his way in the laste.\u0027 But as he was ridin\u0027 him out o\u0027the field, who should see him but the miller. \u0027Is it stalin\u0027 my horse you are, honest man?\u0027 says the miller. \u0027No,\u0027 says the waiver; \u0027I\u0027m only goin\u0027 to axercise him,\u0027 says he, \u0027in the cool o\u0027 the evenin\u0027; it will be good for his health.\u0027 \u0027Thank you kindly,\u0027 says the miller; \u0027but lave him where he is, and you\u0027ll obleege me.\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t afford it,\u0027 says the waiver, runnin\u0027 the horse at the ditch. \u0027Bad luck to your impidence,\u0027 says the miller; \u0027you\u0027ve as much tin about you as a thravellin\u0027 tinker, but you\u0027ve more brass. Come back here, you vagabone,\u0027 says he. But he was too late; away galloped[205] the waiver, and took the road to Dublin, for he thought the best thing he could do was to go to the King o\u0027 Dublin (for Dublin was a grate place thin, and had a king iv its own), and he thought, maybe, the King o\u0027 Dublin would give him work. Well, he was four days goin\u0027 to Dublin, for the baste was not the best and the roads worse, not all as one as now; but there was no turnpikes then, glory be to God! When he got to Dublin, he wint sthrait to the palace, and whin he got into the coortyard he let his horse go and graze about the place, for the grass was growin\u0027 out betune the stones; everything was flourishin\u0027 thin in Dublin, you see. Well, the king was lookin\u0027 out of his dhrawin\u0027-room windy, for divarshin, whin the waiver kem in; but the waiver pretended not to see him, and he wint over to a stone sate, undher the windy—for, you see, there was stone sates all round about the place for the accommodation o\u0027 the[206] people—for the king was a dacent, obleeging man; well, as I said, the waiver wint over and lay down an one o\u0027 the sates, just undher the king\u0027s windy, and purtended to go asleep; but he took care to turn out the front of his shield that had the letthers an it; well, my dear, with that, the king calls out to one of the lords of his coort that was standin\u0027 behind him, howldin\u0027 up the skirt of his coat, accordin\u0027 to rayson, and says he: \u0027Look here,\u0027 says he, \u0027what do you think of a vagabone like that comin\u0027 undher my very nose to go sleep? It is thrue I\u0027m a good king,\u0027 says he, \u0027and I \u0027commodate the people by havin\u0027 sates for them to sit down and enjoy the raycreation and contimplation of seein\u0027 me here, lookin\u0027 out a\u0027 my dhrawin\u0027-room windy, for divarshin; but that is no rayson they are to make a hotel o\u0027 the place, and come and sleep here. Who is it at all?\u0027 says the king.[207] \u0027Not a one o\u0027 me knows, plaze your majesty.\u0027 \u0027I think he must be a furriner,\u0027 says the king; \u0027bekase his dhress is outlandish.\u0027 \u0027And doesn\u0027t know manners, more betoken,\u0027 says the lord. \u0027I\u0027ll go down and circumspect him myself,\u0027 says the king; \u0027folly me,\u0027 says he to the lord, wavin\u0027 his hand at the same time in the most dignacious manner. Down he wint accordingly, followed by the lord; and whin he wint over to where the waiver was lying, sure the first thing he seen was his shield with the big letthers an it, and with that, says he to the lord, \u0027Bedad,\u0027 says he, \u0027this is the very man I want.\u0027 \u0027For what, plaze your majesty?\u0027 says the lord. \u0027To kill that vagabone dragghin, to be sure,\u0027 says the king. \u0027Sure, do you think he could kill him,\u0027 says the lord, \u0027when all the[208] stoutest knights in the land wasn\u0027t aiquil to it, but never kem back, and was ate up alive by the cruel desaiver.\u0027 \u0027Sure, don\u0027t you see there,\u0027 says the king, pointin\u0027 at the shield, \u0027that he killed three score and tin at one blow? and the man that done that, I think, is a match for anything.\u0027 So, with that, he wint over to the waiver and shuck him by the shouldher for to wake him, and the waiver rubbed his eyes as if just wakened, and the king says to him, \u0027God save you,\u0027 said he. \u0027God save you kindly,\u0027 says the waiver, purtendin\u0027 he was quite onknowst who he was spakin\u0027 to. \u0027Do you know who I am,\u0027 says the king, \u0027that you make so free, good man?\u0027 \u0027No, indeed,\u0027 says the waiver; \u0027you have the advantage o\u0027 me.\u0027 \u0027To be sure I have,\u0027 says the king, moighty high; \u0027sure, ain\u0027t I the King o\u0027 Dublin?\u0027 says he.[209] The waiver dhropped down an his two knees forninst the king, and says he, \u0027I beg God\u0027s pardon and yours for the liberty I tuk; plaze your holiness, I hope you\u0027ll excuse it.\u0027 \u0027No offince,\u0027 says the king; \u0027get up, good man. And what brings you here?\u0027 says he. \u0027I\u0027m in want o\u0027 work, plaze your riverence,\u0027 says the waiver. \u0027Well, suppose I give you work?\u0027 says the king. \u0027I\u0027ll be proud to sarve you, my lord,\u0027 says the waiver. \u0027Very well,\u0027 says the king. \u0027You killed three score and tin at one blow, I understan\u0027,\u0027 says the king. \u0027Yis,\u0027 says the waiver; \u0027that was the last thrifle o\u0027 work I done, and I\u0027m afeard my hand \u0027ll go out o\u0027 practice if I don\u0027t get some job to do at wanst.\u0027 \u0027You shall have a job immediantly,\u0027 says the king. \u0027It is not three score and tin or any fine thing like that; it is only a blaguard dhraggin that[210] is disturbin\u0027 the counthry and ruinatin\u0027 my tinanthry wid aitin\u0027 their powlthry, and I\u0027m lost for want of eggs,\u0027 says the king. \u0027Throth, thin, plaze your worship,\u0027 says the waiver, \u0027you look as yollow as if you swallowed twelve yolks this minit.\u0027 \u0027Well, I want this dhraggin to be killed,\u0027 says the king. \u0027It will be no throuble in life to you; and I am only sorry that it isn\u0027t betther worth your while, for he isn\u0027t worth fearin\u0027 at all; only I must tell you, that he lives in the County Galway, in the middle of a bog, and he has an advantage in that.\u0027 \u0027Oh, I don\u0027t value it in the laste,\u0027 says the waiver; \u0027for the last three score and tin I killed was in a soft place.\u0027 \u0027When will you undhertake the job, then?\u0027 says the king. \u0027Let me at him at wanst,\u0027 says the waiver. \u0027That\u0027s what I like,\u0027 says the king;[211] \u0027you\u0027re the very man for my money,\u0027 says he. \u0027Talkin\u0027 of money,\u0027 says the waiver; \u0027by the same token, I\u0027ll want a thrifle o\u0027 change from you for my thravellin\u0027 charges.\u0027 \u0027As much as you plaze,\u0027 says the king; and with the word, he brought him into his closet, where there was an owld stockin\u0027 in an oak chest, burstin\u0027 wid goolden guineas. \u0027Take as many as you plaze,\u0027 says the king; and sure enough, my dear, the little waiver stuffed his tin clothes as full as they could howld with them. \u0027Now, I\u0027m ready for the road,\u0027 says the waiver. \u0027Very well,\u0027 says the king; \u0027but you must have a fresh horse,\u0027 says he. \u0027With all my heart,\u0027 says the waiver, who thought he might as well exchange the miller\u0027s owld garron for a betther. And maybe it\u0027s wondherin\u0027 you are that the waiver would think of goin\u0027 to[212] fight the dhraggin afther what he heerd about him, when he was purtendin\u0027 to be asleep, but he had no sitch notion; all he intended was,—to fob the goold, and ride back again to Duleek with his gains and a good horse. But, you see, cute as the waiver was, the king was cuter still; for these high quolity, you see, is great desaivers; and so the horse the waiver was put an was larned on purpose; and sure, the minit he was mounted, away powdhered the horse, and the divil a toe he\u0027d go but right down to Galway. Well, for four days he was goin\u0027 evermore, until at last the waiver seen a crowd o\u0027 people runnin\u0027 as if owld Nick was at their heels, and they shoutin\u0027 a thousand murdhers and cryin\u0027, \u0027The dhraggin, the dhraggin!\u0027 and he couldn\u0027t stop the horse nor make him turn back, but away he pelted right forninst the terrible baste that was comin\u0027 up to him, and there was the most nefaarious smell o\u0027 sulphur, savin\u0027 your presence,[213] enough to knock you down; and, faith the waiver seen he had no time to lose, and so he threw himself off the horse and made to a three that was growin\u0027 nigh hand, and away he clambered up into it as nimble as a cat; and not a minit had he to spare, for the dhraggin kem up in a powerful rage, and he devoured the horse body and bones, in less than no time; and then he began to sniffle and scent about for the waiver, and at last he clapt his eye an him, where he was, up in the three, and says he, \u0027In throth, you might as well come down out o\u0027 that,\u0027 says he; \u0027for I\u0027ll have you as sure as eggs is mate.\u0027 \u0027Divil a fut I\u0027ll go down,\u0027 says the waiver. \u0027Sorra care, I care,\u0027 says the dhraggin; \u0027for you\u0027re as good as ready money in my pocket this minit, for I\u0027ll lie undher this three,\u0027 says he, \u0027and sooner or later you must fall to my share\u0027; and sure enough he sot down, and began to pick his teeth with his[214] tail, afther the heavy brekquest he made that mornin\u0027 (for he ate a whole village, let alone the horse), and he got dhrowsy at last, and fell asleep; but before he wint to sleep, he wound himself all round about the three, all as one as a lady windin\u0027 ribbon round her finger, so that the waiver could not escape. Well, as soon as the waiver knew he was dead asleep, by the snorin\u0027 of him—and every snore he let out of him was like a clap o\u0027 thunder—that minit the waiver began to creep down the three, as cautious as a fox; and he was very nigh hand the bottom, when, bad cess to it, a thievin\u0027 branch he was dipindin\u0027 an bruk, and down he fell right a-top o\u0027 the dhraggin; but if he did, good luck was an his side, for where should he fall but with his two legs right acrass the dhraggin\u0027s neck, and, my jew\u0027l, he laid howlt o\u0027 the baste\u0027s ears, and there he kept his grip, for the dhraggin wakened and en[215]dayvoured for to bite him; but, you see, by rayson the waiver was behind his ears, he could not come at him, and, with that, he endayvoured for to shake him off; but the divil a stir could he stir the waiver; and though he shuk all the scales an his body, he could not turn the scale agin the waiver. \u0027By the hokey, this is too bad intirely,\u0027 says the dhraggin; \u0027but if you won\u0027t let go,\u0027 says he, \u0027by the powers o\u0027 wildfire, I\u0027ll give you a ride that \u0027ill astonish your siven small sinses, my boy\u0027; and, with that, away he flew like mad; and where do you think he did fly?—bedad, he flew sthraight for Dublin, divil a less. But the waiver bein\u0027 an his neck was a great disthress to him, and he would rather have had him an inside passenger; but, anyway, he flew and he flew till he kem slap up agin the palace o\u0027 the king; for, bein\u0027 blind with the rage, he never seen it, and he knocked his brains out—that[216] is, the small thrifle he had—and down he fell spacheless. An\u0027 you see, good luck would have it, that the King o\u0027 Dublin was lookin\u0027 out iv\u0027 his dhrawin\u0027-room windy, for divarshin, that day also, and whin he seen the waiver ridin\u0027 an the fiery dhraggin (for he was blazin\u0027 like a tar-barrel), he called out to his coortyers to come and see the show. \u0027By the powdhers o\u0027 war, here comes the knight arriant,\u0027 says the king, \u0027ridin\u0027 the dhraggin that\u0027s all afire, and if he gets into the palace, yiz must be ready wid the fire ingines,\u0027 says he, \u0027for to put him out.\u0027 But when they seen the dhraggin fall outside, they all run downstairs and scampered into the palace-yard for to circumspect the curosity; and by the time they got down, the waiver had got off o\u0027 the dhraggin\u0027s neck, and runnin\u0027 up to the king, says he, \u0027Plaze your holiness,\u0027 says he, \u0027I did not think myself worthy of killin\u0027 this facetious baste, so I brought him to yourself for[217] to do him the honour of decripitation by your own royal five fingers. But I tamed him first, before I allowed him the liberty for to dar\u0027 to appear in your royal prisince, and you\u0027ll oblige me if you\u0027ll just make your mark with your own hand upon the onruly baste\u0027s neck.\u0027 And with that the king, sure enough, dhrew out his swoord and took the head aff the dirty brute as clane as a new pin. Well, there was great rejoicin\u0027 in the coort that the dhraggin was killed; and says the king to the little waiver, says he, \u0027You are a knight arriant as it is, and so it would be of no use for to knight you over agin; but I will make you a lord,\u0027 says he. \u0027O Lord!\u0027 says the waiver, thunder-struck like at his own good luck. \u0027I will,\u0027 says the king; \u0027and as you are the first man I ever heer\u0027d tell of that rode a dhraggin, you shall be called Lord Mount Dhraggin,\u0027 says he. \u0027And where\u0027s my estates, plaze your[218] holiness?\u0027 says the waiver, who always had a sharp look-out afther the main chance. \u0027Oh, I didn\u0027t forget that,\u0027 says the king; \u0027it is my royal pleasure to provide well for you, and for that rayson I make you a present of all the dhraggins in the world, and give you power over them from this out,\u0027 says he. \u0027Is that all?\u0027 says the waiver. \u0027All!\u0027 says the king. \u0027Why, you ongrateful little vagabone, was the like ever given to any man before?\u0027 \u0027I b\u0027lieve not, indeed,\u0027 says the waiver; \u0027many thanks to your majesty.\u0027 \u0027But that is not all I\u0027ll do for you,\u0027 says the king; \u0027I\u0027ll give you my daughther too in marriage,\u0027 says he. Now, you see, that was nothin\u0027 more than what he promised the waiver in his first promise; for, by all accounts, the king\u0027s daughther was the greatest dhraggin ever was seen, and had the divil\u0027s own tongue, and a beard a yard[219] long, which she purtended was put an her by way of a penance by Father Mulcahy, her confissor; but it was well known it was in the family for ages, and no wondher it was so long, by rayson of that same.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3259/89307.html","bookId":566,"book":{"id":566,"title":"Irish Fairy Tales","description":"简介： I am often doubted when I say that the Irish peasantry still believe in fairies.
