{"id":17708,"no":10,"title":"EVIL SPIRITS THE DEVIL\u0027S MILL By Samuel Lover","content":"You see, sir, there was a colonel wanst, in times back, that owned a power of land about here—but God keep uz, they said he didn\u0027t come by it honestly, but did a crooked turn whenever \u0027twas to sarve himself. Well, the story goes that at last the divil (God bless us) kem to him, and promised him hapes o\u0027 money, and all his heart could desire and more, too, if he\u0027d sell his sowl in exchange. He was too cunnin\u0027 for that; bad as he was—and he was bad enough[96] God knows—he had some regard for his poor sinful sowl, and he would not give himself up to the divil, all out; but, the villain, he thought he might make a bargain with the old chap, and get all he wanted, and keep himself out of harm\u0027s way still: for he was mighty \u0027cute—and, throth, he was able for Owld Nick any day. Well, the bargain was struck, and it was this-a-way: the divil was to give him all the goold ever he\u0027d ask for, and was to let him alone as long as he could; and the timpter promised him a long day, and said \u0027twould be a great while before he\u0027d want him at all, at all; and whin that time kem, he was to keep his hands aff him, as long as the other could give him some work he couldn\u0027t do. So, when the bargain was made, \u0027Now,\u0027 says the colonel to the divil, \u0027give me all the money I want.\u0027 \u0027As much as you like,\u0027 says Owld Nick; \u0027how much will you have?\u0027[97] \u0027You must fill me that room,\u0027 says he, pointin\u0027 into a murtherin\u0027 big room that he emptied out on purpose—\u0027you must fill that room,\u0027 says he, \u0027up to the very ceilin\u0027 with goolden guineas.\u0027 \u0027And welkem,\u0027 says the divil. With that, sir, he began to shovel the guineas into the room like mad; and the colonel towld him, that as soon as he was done, to come to him in his own parlour below, and that he would then go up and see if the divil was as good as his word, and had filled the room with the goolden guineas. So the colonel went downstairs, and the owld fellow worked away as busy as a nailer, shovellin\u0027 in the guineas by hundherds and thousands. Well, he worked away for an hour and more, and at last he began to get tired; and he thought it mighty odd that the room wasn\u0027t fillin\u0027 fasther. Well, afther restin\u0027 for awhile, he began agin, and he put his shouldher to the[98] work in airnest; but still the room was no fuller at all, at all. \u0027Och! bad luck to me,\u0027 says the divil, \u0027but the likes of this I never seen,\u0027 says he, \u0027far and near, up and down—the dickens a room I ever kem across afore,\u0027 says he, \u0027I couldn\u0027t cram while a cook would be crammin\u0027 a turkey, till now; and here I am,\u0027 says he, \u0027losin\u0027 my whole day, and I with such a power o\u0027 work an my hands yit, and this room no fuller than five minutes ago.\u0027 Begor, while he was spakin\u0027 he seen the hape o\u0027 guineas in the middle of the flure growing littler and littler every minit; and at last they wor disappearing, for all the world like corn in the hopper of a mill. \u0027Ho! ho!\u0027 says Owld Nick, \u0027is that the way wid you?\u0027 says he; and wid that, he ran over to the hape of goold—and what would you think, but it was runnin\u0027 down through a great big hole in the flure, that the colonel made[99] through the ceilin\u0027 in the room below; and that was the work he was at afther he left the divil, though he purtended he was only waitin\u0027 for him in his parlour; and there the divil, when he looked down the hole in the flure, seen the colonel, not content with the two rooms full of guineas, but with a big shovel throwin\u0027 them into a closet a\u0027 one side of him as fast as they fell down. So, putting his head through the hole, he called down to the colonel: \u0027Hillo, neighbour!\u0027 says he. The colonel looked up, and grew as white as a sheet, when he seen he was found out, and the red eyes starin\u0027 down at him through the hole. \u0027Musha, bad luck to your impudence!\u0027 says Owld Nick: \u0027it is sthrivin\u0027 to chate me you are,\u0027 says he, \u0027you villain!\u0027 \u0027Oh, forgive me for this wanst!\u0027 says the colonel, \u0027and, upon the honour of a gintleman,\u0027 says he, \u0027I\u0027ll never——\u0027[100] \u0027Whisht! whisht! you thievin\u0027 rogue,\u0027 says the divil, \u0027I\u0027m not angry with you at all, at all, but only like you the betther, bekase you\u0027re so cute;—lave off slaving yourself there,\u0027 says he, \u0027you have got goold enough for this time; and whenever you want more, you have only to say the word, and it shall be yours to command.\u0027 So with that, the divil and he parted for that time: and myself doesn\u0027t know whether they used to meet often afther or not; but the colonel never wanted money, anyhow, but went on prosperous in the world—and, as the saying is, if he took the dirt out o\u0027 the road, it id turn to money wid him; and so, in course of time, he bought great estates, and was a great man entirely—not a greater in Ireland, throth. At last, afther many years of prosperity, the owld colonel got stricken in years, and he began to have misgivings in his conscience for his[101] wicked doings, and his heart was heavy as the fear of death came upon him; and sure enough, while he had such murnful thoughts, the divil kem to him, and towld him he should go wid him. Well, to be sure, the owld man was frekened, but he plucked up his courage and his cuteness, and towld the divil, in a bantherin\u0027 way, jokin\u0027 like, that he had partic\u0027lar business thin, that he was goin\u0027 to a party, and hoped an owld friend wouldn\u0027t inconvaynience him that-a-way. The divil said he\u0027d call the next day, and that he must be ready; and sure enough in the evenin\u0027 he kem to him; and when the colonel seen him, he reminded him of his bargain that as long as he could give him some work he couldn\u0027t do, he wasn\u0027t obleeged to go. \u0027That\u0027s thrue,\u0027 says the divil. \u0027I\u0027m glad you\u0027re as good as your word, anyhow,\u0027 says the colonel.[102] \u0027I never bruk my word yit,\u0027 says the owld chap, cocking up his horns consaitedly; \u0027honour bright,\u0027 says he. \u0027Well then,\u0027 says the colonel, \u0027build me a mill, down there, by the river,\u0027 says he, \u0027and let me have it finished by to-morrow mornin\u0027.\u0027 \u0027Your will is my pleasure,\u0027 says the owld chap, and away he wint; and the colonel thought he had nicked Owld Nick at last, and wint to bed quite aisy in his mind. But, jewel machree, sure the first thing he heerd the next mornin\u0027 was that the whole counthry round was runnin\u0027 to see a fine bran new mill that was an the river-side, where the evening before not a thing at all, at all, but rushes was standin\u0027, and all, of coorse, wonderin\u0027 what brought it there; and some sayin\u0027 \u0027twas not lucky, and many more throubled in their mind, but one and all agreein\u0027 it was no good; and that\u0027s the very mill forninst you.[103] But when the colonel heered it he was more throubled than any, of coorse, and began to conthrive what else he could think iv to keep himself out iv the claws of the owld one. Well, he often heerd tell that there was one thing the divil never could do, and I darsay you heerd it too, sir,—that is, that he couldn\u0027t make a rope out of the sands of the say; and so when the owld one kem to him the next day and said his job was done, and that now the mill was built he must either tell him somethin\u0027 else he wanted done, or come away wid him. So the colonel said he saw it was all over wid him. \u0027But,\u0027 says he, \u0027I wouldn\u0027t like to go wid you alive, and sure it\u0027s all the same to you, alive or dead?\u0027 \u0027Oh, that won\u0027t do,\u0027 says his frind; \u0027I can\u0027t wait no more,\u0027 says he. \u0027I don\u0027t want you to wait, my dear frind,\u0027 says the colonel; \u0027all I want[104] is, that you\u0027ll be plased to kill me before you take me away.\u0027 \u0027With pleasure,\u0027 says Owld Nick. \u0027But will you promise me my choice of dyin\u0027 one partic\u0027lar way?\u0027 says the colonel. \u0027Half a dozen ways, if it plazes you,\u0027 says he. \u0027You\u0027re mighty obleegin\u0027,\u0027 says the colonel; \u0027and so,\u0027 says he, \u0027I\u0027d rather die by bein\u0027 hanged with a rope made out of the sands of the say,\u0027 says he, lookin\u0027 mighty knowin\u0027 at the owld fellow. \u0027I\u0027ve always one about me,\u0027 says the divil, \u0027to obleege my frinds,\u0027 says he; and with that he pulls out a rope made of sand, sure enough. \u0027Oh, it\u0027s game you\u0027re makin\u0027,\u0027 says the colonel, growin\u0027 as white as a sheet. \u0027The game is mine, sure enough,\u0027 says the owld fellow, grinnin\u0027, with a terrible laugh. \u0027That\u0027s not a sand-rope at all,\u0027 says the colonel.[105] \u0027Isn\u0027t it?\u0027 says the divil, hittin\u0027 him acrass the face with the ind iv the rope, and the sand (for it was made of sand, sure enough) went into one of his eyes, and made the tears come with the pain. \u0027That bates all I ever seen or heerd,\u0027 says the colonel, sthrivin\u0027 to rally and make another offer; \u0027is there anything you can\u0027t do?\u0027 \u0027Nothing you can tell me,\u0027 says the divil, \u0027so you may as well leave off your palaverin\u0027 and come along at wanst.\u0027 \u0027Will you give me one more offer,\u0027 says the colonel. \u0027You don\u0027t desarve it,\u0027 says the divil; \u0027but I don\u0027t care if I do\u0027; for you see, sir, he was only playin\u0027 wid him, and tantalising the owld sinner. \u0027All fair,\u0027 says the colonel, and with that he ax\u0027d him could he stop a woman\u0027s tongue. \u0027Thry me,\u0027 says Owld Nick.[106] \u0027Well then,\u0027 says the colonel, \u0027make my lady\u0027s tongue be quiet for the next month and I\u0027d thank you.\u0027 \u0027She\u0027ll never trouble you agin,\u0027 says Owld Nick; and with that the colonel heerd roarin\u0027 and cryin\u0027, and the door of his room was thrown open and in ran his daughter, and fell down at his feet, telling him her mother had just dhropped dead. The minit the door opened, the divil runs and hides himself behind a big elbow-chair; and the colonel was frekened almost out of his siven sinses by raison of the sudden death of his poor lady, let alone the jeopardy he was in himself, seein\u0027 how the divil had forestalled him every way; and after ringin\u0027 his bell and callin\u0027 to his sarvants and recoverin\u0027 his daughter out of her faint, he was goin\u0027 away wid her out of the room, whin the divil caught howld of him by the skirt of the coat, and the colonel was obleeged to let his daughter be carried[107] out by the sarvants, and shut the door afther them. \u0027Well,\u0027 says the divil, and he grinn\u0027d and wagg\u0027d his tail, all as one as a dog when he\u0027s plaised; \u0027what do you say now?\u0027 says he. \u0027Oh,\u0027 says the colonel, \u0027only lave me alone until I bury my poor wife,\u0027 says he, \u0027and I\u0027ll go with you then, you villain,\u0027 says he. \u0027Don\u0027t call names,\u0027 says the divil; \u0027you had better keep a civil tongue in your head,\u0027 says he; \u0027and it doesn\u0027t become a gintleman to forget good manners.\u0027 \u0027Well, sir, to make a long story short, the divil purtended to let him off, out of kindness, for three days antil his wife was buried; but the raison of it was this, that when the lady his daughter fainted, he loosened the clothes about her throat, and in pulling some of her dhress away, he tuk off a goold chain that was on her neck and put it in his pocket,[108] and the chain had a diamond crass on it (the Lord be praised!) and the divil darn\u0027t touch him while he had the sign of the crass about him. Well, the poor colonel (God forgive him!) was grieved for the loss of his lady, and she had an illigant berrin—and they say that when the prayers was readin\u0027 over the dead, the owld colonel took it to heart like anything, and the word o\u0027 God kem home to his poor sinful sowl at last. Well, sir, to make a long story short, the ind of it was, that for the three days o\u0027 grace that was given to him the poor deluded owld sinner did nothin\u0027 at all but read the Bible from mornin\u0027 till night, and bit or sup didn\u0027t pass his lips all the time, he was so intint upon the Holy Book, but he sat up in an owld room in the far ind of the house, and bid no one disturb him an no account, and struv to make his heart bould with the words iv life; and sure it was somethin\u0027[109] strinthened him at last, though as the time drew nigh that the inimy was to come, he didn\u0027t feel aisy, and no wondher; and, bedad the three days was past and gone in no time, and the story goes that at the dead hour o\u0027 the night, when the poor sinner was readin\u0027 away as fast as he could, my jew\u0027l, his heart jumped up to his mouth at gettin\u0027 a tap on the shoulder. \u0027Oh, murther!\u0027 says he, \u0027who\u0027s there?\u0027 for he was afeard to look up. \u0027It\u0027s me,\u0027 says the owld one, and he stood right forninst him, and his eyes like coals o\u0027 fire, lookin\u0027 him through, and he said, with a voice that almost split his owld heart, \u0027Come!\u0027 says he. \u0027Another day!\u0027 cried out the poor colonel. \u0027Not another hour,\u0027 says Sat\u0027n. \u0027Half an hour!\u0027 \u0027Not a quarther,\u0027 says the divil, grinnin\u0027 with a bitther laugh; \u0027give[110] over your reading I bid you,\u0027 says he, \u0027and come away wid me.\u0027 \u0027Only gi\u0027 me a few minits,\u0027 says he. \u0027Lave aff your palaverin\u0027 you snakin\u0027 owld sinner,\u0027 says Sat\u0027n; \u0027you know you\u0027re bought and sould to me, and a purty bargain I have o\u0027 you, you owld baste,\u0027 says he; \u0027so come along at wanst,\u0027 and he put out his claw to ketch him; but the colonel tuk a fast hould o\u0027 the Bible, and begged hard that he\u0027d let him alone, and wouldn\u0027t harm him antil the bit o\u0027 candle that was just blinkin\u0027 in the socket before him was burned out. \u0027Well, have it so, you dirty coward,\u0027 says Owld Nick, and with that he spit an him. But the poor owld colonel didn\u0027t lose a minit (for he was cunnin\u0027 to the ind), but snatched the little taste o\u0027 candle that was forninst him out o\u0027 the candlestick, and puttin\u0027 it an the Holy Book before him, he shut down the cover of it and quinched[111] the light. With that the divil gave a roar like a bull, and vanished in a flash o\u0027 fire, and the poor colonel fainted away in his chair; but the sarvants heerd the noise (for the divil tore aff the roof o\u0027 the house when he left it), and run into the room, and brought their master to himself agin. And from that day he was an althered man, and used to have the Bible read to him every day, for he couldn\u0027t read himself any more, by raison of losin\u0027 his eyesight when the divil hit him with the rope of sand in the face, and afther spit an him—for the sand wint into one eye, and he lost the other that-a-way, savin\u0027 your presence. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3259/89301.html","bookId":566,"book":{"id":566,"title":"Irish Fairy Tales","description":"简介： I am often doubted when I say that the Irish peasantry still believe in fairies.
