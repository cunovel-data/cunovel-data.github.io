{"id":17711,"no":13,"title":"SEANCHAN THE BARD AND THE KING OF THE CATS By Lady Wilde","content":"When Seanchan, the renowned Bard, was made Ard-Filé or Chief Poet of Ireland, Guaire, the king of Connaught, to do him honour, made a great feast for him and the whole Bardic Association. And all the professors and learned men went to the king\u0027s house, the great ollaves of poetry and history and music, and of the arts and sciences; and the learned, aged females, Grug and Grag and Grangait; and all the chief poets and[142] poetesses of Ireland, an amazing number. But Guaire the king entertained them all splendidly, so that the ancient pathway to his palace is still called \u0027The Road of the Dishes.\u0027 And each day he asked, \u0027How fares it with my noble guests?\u0027 But they were all discontented, and wanted things he could not get for them. So he was very sorrowful, and prayed to God to be delivered from \u0027the learned men and women, a vexatious class.\u0027 Still the feast went on for three days and three nights. And they drank and made merry. And the whole Bardic Association entertained the nobles with the choicest music and professional accomplishments. But Seanchan sulked and would neither eat nor drink, for he was jealous of the nobles of Connaught. And when he saw how much they consumed of the best meats and wine, he declared he would taste no food[143] till they and their servants were all sent away out of the house. And when Guaire asked him again, \u0027How fares my noble guest, and this great and excellent people?\u0027 Seanchan answered, \u0027I have never had worse days, nor worse nights, nor worse dinners in my life.\u0027 And he ate nothing for three whole days. Then the king was sorely grieved that the whole Bardic Association should be feasting and drinking while Seanchan, the chief poet of Erin, was fasting and weak. So he sent his favourite serving-man, a person of mild manners and cleanliness, to offer special dishes to the bard. \u0027Take them away,\u0027 said Seanchan; \u0027I\u0027ll have none of them.\u0027 \u0027And why, O Royal Bard?\u0027 asked the servitor. \u0027Because thou art an uncomely youth,\u0027 answered Seanchan. \u0027Thy grandfather was chip-nailed—I have seen him; I shall eat no food from thy hands.\u0027[144] Then the king called a beautiful maiden to him, his foster-daughter, and said, \u0027Lady, bring thou this wheaten cake and this dish of salmon to the illustrious poet, and serve him thyself.\u0027 So the maiden went. But when Seanchan saw her he asked: \u0027Who sent thee hither, and why hast thou brought me food?\u0027 \u0027My lord the king sent me, O Royal Bard,\u0027 she answered, \u0027because I am comely to look upon, and he bade me serve thee with food myself.\u0027 \u0027Take it away,\u0027 said Seanchan, \u0027thou art an unseemly girl, I know of none more ugly. I have seen thy grandmother; she sat on a wall one day and pointed out the way with her hand to some travelling lepers. How could I touch thy food?\u0027 So the maiden went away in sorrow. And then Guaire the king was indeed angry, and he exclaimed, \u0027My malediction on the mouth that uttered[145] that! May the kiss of a leper be on Seanchan\u0027s lips before he dies!\u0027 Now there was a young serving-girl there, and she said to Seanchan, \u0027There is a hen\u0027s egg in the place, my lord, may I bring it to thee, O Chief Bard?\u0027 \u0027It will suffice,\u0027 said Seanchan; \u0027bring it that I may eat.\u0027 But when she went to look for it, behold the egg was gone. \u0027Thou hast eaten it,\u0027 said the bard, in wrath. \u0027Not so, my lord,\u0027 she answered; \u0027but the mice, the nimble race, have carried it away.\u0027 \u0027Then I will satirise them in a poem,\u0027 said Seanchan; and forthwith he chanted so bitter a satire against them that ten mice fell dead at once in his presence. \u0027\u0027Tis well,\u0027 said Seanchan; \u0027but the cat is the one most to blame, for it was her duty to suppress the mice. Therefore I shall satirise the tribe of[146] the cats, and their chief lord, Irusan, son of Arusan; for I know where he lives with his wife Spit-fire, and his daughter Sharp-tooth, with her brothers the Purrer and the Growler. But I shall begin with Irusan himself, for he is king, and answerable for all the cats.\u0027 And he said: \u0027Irusan, monster of claws, who strikes at the mouse but lets it go; weakest of cats. The otter did well who bit off the tips of thy progenitor\u0027s ears, so that every cat since is jagged-eared. Let thy tail hang down; it is right, for the mouse jeers at thee.\u0027 Now Irusan heard these words in his cave, and he said to his daughter Sharp-tooth: \u0027Seanchan has satirised me, but I will be avenged.\u0027 \u0027Nay, father,\u0027 she said, \u0027bring him here alive that we may all take our revenge.\u0027 \u0027I shall go then and bring him,\u0027 said Irusan; \u0027so send thy brothers after me.[147] Now when it was told to Seanchan that the King of the Cats was on his way to come and kill him, he was timorous, and besought Guaire and all the nobles to stand by and protect him. And before long a vibrating, impressive, impetuous sound was heard, like a raging tempest of fire in full blaze. And when the cat appeared he seemed to them of the size of a bullock; and this was his appearance—rapacious, panting, jagged-eared, snub-nosed, sharp-toothed, nimble, angry, vindictive, glare-eyed, terrible, sharp-clawed. Such was his similitude. But he passed on amongst them, not minding till he came to Seanchan; and him he seized by the arm and jerked him up on his back, and made off the way he came before any one could touch him; for he had no other object in view but to get hold of the poet. Now Seanchan, being in evil plight, had recourse to flattery. \u0027O Irusan,\u0027[148] he exclaimed, \u0027how truly splendid thou art: such running, such leaps, such strength, and such agility! But what evil have I done, O Irusan, son of Arusan? spare me, I entreat. I invoke the saints between thee and me, O great King of the Cats.\u0027 But not a bit did the cat let go his hold for all this fine talk, but went straight on to Clonmacnoise, where there was a forge; and St. Kieran happened to be there standing at the door. \u0027What!\u0027 exclaimed the saint; \u0027is that the Chief Bard of Erin on the back of a cat? Has Guaire\u0027s hospitality ended in this?\u0027 And he ran for a red-hot bar of iron that was in the furnace, and struck the cat on the side with it, so that the iron passed through him, and he fell down lifeless. \u0027Now my curse on the hand that gave that blow!\u0027 said the bard, when he got upon his feet. \u0027And wherefore?\u0027 asked St. Kieran.[149] \u0027Because,\u0027 answered Seanchan, \u0027I would rather Irusan had killed me, and eaten me every bit, that so I might bring disgrace on Guaire for the bad food he gave me; for it was all owing to his wretched dinners that I got into this plight.\u0027 And when all the other kings heard of Seanchan\u0027s misfortunes, they sent to beg he would visit their courts. But he would have neither kiss nor welcome from them, and went on his way to the bardic mansion, where the best of good living was always to be had. And ever after the kings were afraid to offend Seanchan. So as long as he lived he had the chief place at the feast, and all the nobles there were made to sit below him, and Seanchan was content. And in time he and Guaire were reconciled; and Seanchan and all the ollaves, and the whole Bardic Association, were feasted by the king for thirty days in noble style, and had the choicest of viands[150] and the best of French wines to drink, served in goblets of silver. And in return for his splendid hospitality the Bardic Association decreed unanimously a vote of thanks to the king. And they praised him in poems as \u0027Guaire the Generous,\u0027 by which name he was ever after known in history, for the words of the poet are immortal.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3259/89304.html","bookId":566,"book":{"id":566,"title":"Irish Fairy Tales","description":"简介： I am often doubted when I say that the Irish peasantry still believe in fairies.
