{"id":17706,"no":8,"title":"THE FAIRY GREYHOUND","content":"Paddy M\u0027Dermid was one of the most rollicking boys in the whole county of Kildare. Fair or pattern[3] wouldn\u0027t be held barring he was in the midst of it. He was in every place, like bad luck, and his poor little farm was seldom sowed in season; and where he expected barley, there grew nothing but weeds. Money became scarce in poor Paddy\u0027s pocket; and the cow went after the pig, until nearly [70]all he had was gone. Lucky however for him, if he had gomch (sense) enough to mind it, he had a most beautiful dream one night as he lay tossicated (drunk) in the Rath[4] of Monogue, because he wasn\u0027t able to come home. He dreamt that, under the place where he lay, a pot of money was buried since long before the memory of man. Paddy kept the dream to himself until the next night, when, taking a spade and pickaxe, with a bottle of holy water, he went to the Rath, and, having made a circle round the place, commenced diggin\u0027 sure enough, for the bare life and sowl of him thinkin\u0027 that he was made up for ever and ever. He had sunk about twice the depth of his knees, when whack the pickaxe struck against a flag, and at the same time Paddy heard something breathe quite near him. He looked up, and just [71]fornent him there sat on his haunches a comely-looking greyhound. \u0027God save you,\u0027 said Paddy, every hair in his head standing up as straight as a sally twig. \u0027Save you kindly,\u0027 answered the greyhound—leaving out God, the beast, bekase he was the divil. Christ defend us from ever seeing the likes o\u0027 him. \u0027Musha, Paddy M\u0027Dermid,\u0027 said he, \u0027what would you be looking after in that grave of a hole you\u0027re diggin\u0027 there?\u0027 \u0027Faith, nothing at all, at all,\u0027 answered Paddy; bekase you see he didn\u0027t like the stranger. \u0027Arrah, be easy now, Paddy M\u0027Dermid,\u0027 said the greyhound; \u0027don\u0027t I know very well what you are looking for?\u0027 \u0027Why then in truth, if you do, I may as well tell you at wonst, particularly as you seem a civil-looking gentleman, that\u0027s not above speak[72]ing to a poor gossoon like myself.\u0027 (Paddy wanted to butter him up a bit.) \u0027Well then,\u0027 said the greyhound, \u0027come out here and sit down on this bank,\u0027 and Paddy, like a gomulagh (fool), did as he was desired, but had hardly put his brogue outside of the circle made by the holy water, when the beast of a hound set upon him, and drove him out of the Rath; for Paddy was frightened, as well he might, at the fire that flamed from his mouth. But next night he returned, full sure the money was there. As before, he made a circle, and touched the flag, when my gentleman, the greyhound, appeared in the ould place. \u0027Oh ho,\u0027 said Paddy, \u0027you are there, are you? but it will be a long day, I promise you, before you trick me again\u0027; and he made another stroke at the flag. \u0027Well, Paddy M\u0027Dermid,\u0027 said the[73] hound, \u0027since you will have money, you must; but say, how much will satisfy you?\u0027 Paddy scratched his conlaan, and after a while said— \u0027How much will your honour give me?\u0027 for he thought it better to be civil. \u0027Just as much as you consider reasonable, Paddy M\u0027Dermid.\u0027 \u0027Egad,\u0027 says Paddy to himself, \u0027there\u0027s nothing like axin\u0027 enough.\u0027 \u0027Say fifty thousand pounds,\u0027 said he. (He might as well have said a hundred thousand, for I\u0027ll be bail the beast had money gulloure.) \u0027You shall have it,\u0027 said the hound; and then, after trotting away a little bit, he came back with a crock full of guineas between his paws. \u0027Come here and reckon them,\u0027 said he; but Paddy was up to him, and refused to stir, so the crock was shoved alongside the blessed and holy circle, and Paddy pulled it in, right glad to[74] have it in his clutches, and never stood still until he reached his own home, where his guineas turned into little bones, and his ould mother laughed at him. Paddy now swore vengeance against the deceitful beast of a greyhound, and went next night to the Rath again, where, as before, he met Mr. Hound. \u0027So you are here again, Paddy?\u0027 said he. \u0027Yes, you big blaggard,\u0027 said Paddy, \u0027and I\u0027ll never leave this place until I pull out the pot of money that\u0027s buried here.\u0027 \u0027Oh, you won\u0027t,\u0027 said he. \u0027Well, Paddy M\u0027Dermid, since I see you are such a brave venturesome fellow I\u0027ll be after making you up if you walk downstairs with me out of the could\u0027; and sure enough it was snowing like murder. \u0027Oh may I never see Athy if I do,\u0027 returned Paddy, \u0027for you only want to be loading me with ould bones,[75] or perhaps breaking my own, which would be just as bad.\u0027 \u0027\u0027Pon honour,\u0027 said the hound, \u0027I am your friend; and so don\u0027t stand in your own light; come with me and your fortune is made. Remain where you are and you\u0027ll die a beggar-man.\u0027 So bedad, with one palaver and another, Paddy consented; and in the middle of the Rath opened up a beautiful staircase, down which they walked; and after winding and turning they came to a house much finer than the Duke of Leinster\u0027s, in which all the tables and chairs were solid gold. Paddy was delighted; and after sitting down, a fine lady handed him a glass of something to drink; but he had hardly swallowed a spoonful when all around set up a horrid yell, and those who before appeared beautiful now looked like what they were—enraged \u0027good people\u0027 (fairies). Before Paddy could bless himself, they seized him, legs and arms, carried him out to a[76] great high hill that stood like a wall over a river, and flung him down. \u0027Murder!\u0027 cried Paddy; but it was no use, no use; he fell upon a rock, and lay there as dead until next morning, where some people found him in the trench that surrounds the mote of Coulhall, the \u0027good people\u0027 having carried him there; and from that hour to the day of his death he was the greatest object in the world. He walked double, and had his mouth (God bless us) where his ear should be. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3259/89299.html","bookId":566,"book":{"id":566,"title":"Irish Fairy Tales","description":"简介： I am often doubted when I say that the Irish peasantry still believe in fairies.
