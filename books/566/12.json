{"id":17710,"no":12,"title":"THE MAN WHO NEVER KNEW FEAR","content":"There was once a lady, and she had two sons whose names were Louras (Lawrence) and Carrol. From the day that Lawrence was born nothing ever made him afraid, but Carrol would never go outside the door from the time the darkness of the night began. It was the custom at that time when a person died for people to watch the dead person\u0027s grave in turn, one[124] after another; for there used to be destroyers going about stealing the corpses. When the mother of Carrol and Lawrence died, Carrol said to Lawrence— \u0027You say that nothing ever made you afraid yet, but I\u0027ll make a bet with you that you haven\u0027t courage to watch your mother\u0027s tomb to-night.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll make a bet with you that I have,\u0027 said Lawrence. When the darkness of the night was coming, Lawrence put on his sword and went to the burying-ground. He sat down on a tombstone near his mother\u0027s grave till it was far in the night and sleep was coming upon him. Then he saw a big black thing coming to him, and when it came near him he saw that it was a head without a body that was in it. He drew the sword to give it a blow if it should come any nearer, but it didn\u0027t come. Lawrence remained looking at it until the light[125] of the day was coming, then the head-without-body went, and Lawrence came home. Carrol asked him, did he see anything in the graveyard. \u0027I did,\u0027 said Lawrence, \u0027and my mother\u0027s body would be gone, but that I was guarding it.\u0027 \u0027Was it dead or alive, the person you saw?\u0027 said Carrol. \u0027I don\u0027t know was it dead or alive,\u0027 said Lawrence; \u0027there was nothing in it but a head without a body.\u0027 \u0027Weren\u0027t you afraid?\u0027 says Carrol. \u0027Indeed I wasn\u0027t,\u0027 said Lawrence; \u0027don\u0027t you know that nothing in the world ever put fear on me.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll bet again with you that you haven\u0027t the courage to watch to-night again,\u0027 says Carrol. \u0027I would make that bet with you,\u0027 said Lawrence, \u0027but that there is a night\u0027s sleep wanting to me. Go yourself to-night.\u0027 \u0027I wouldn\u0027t go to the graveyard[126] to-night if I were to get the riches of the world,\u0027 says Carrol. \u0027Unless you go your mother\u0027s body will be gone in the morning,\u0027 says Lawrence. \u0027If only you watch to-night and to-morrow night, I never will ask of you to do a turn of work as long as you will be alive,\u0027 said Carrol, \u0027but I think there is fear on you.\u0027 \u0027To show you that there\u0027s no fear on me,\u0027 said Lawrence, \u0027I will watch.\u0027 He went to sleep, and when the evening came he rose up, put on his sword, and went to the graveyard. He sat on a tombstone near his mother\u0027s grave. About the middle of the night he heard a great sound coming. A big black thing came as far as the grave and began rooting up the clay. Lawrence drew back his sword, and with one blow he made two halves of the big black thing, and with the second blow he made two halves of each half, and he saw it no more.[127] Lawrence went home in the morning, and Carrol asked him did he see anything. \u0027I did,\u0027 said Lawrence, \u0027and only that I was there my mother\u0027s body would be gone.\u0027 \u0027Is it the head-without-body that came again?\u0027 said Carrol. \u0027It was not, but a big black thing, and it was digging up my mother\u0027s grave until I made two halves of it.\u0027 Lawrence slept that day, and when the evening came he rose up, put on his sword, and went to the churchyard. He sat down on a tombstone until it was the middle of the night. Then he saw a thing as white as snow and as hateful as sin; it had a man\u0027s head on it, and teeth as long as a flax-carder. Lawrence drew back the sword and was going to deal it a blow, when it said— \u0027Hold your hand; you have saved your mother\u0027s body, and there is not a man in Ireland as brave as you.[128] There is great riches waiting for you if you go looking for it.\u0027 Lawrence went home, and Carrol asked him did he see anything. \u0027I did,\u0027 said Lawrence, \u0027and but that I was there my mother\u0027s body would be gone, but there\u0027s no fear of it now.\u0027 In the morning, the day on the morrow, Lawrence said to Carrol— \u0027Give me my share of money, and I\u0027ll go on a journey, until I have a look round the country.\u0027 Carrol gave him the money, and he went walking. He went on until he came to a large town. He went into the house of a baker to get bread. The baker began talking to him, and asked him how far he was going. \u0027I am going looking for something that will put fear on me,\u0027 said Lawrence. \u0027Have you much money?\u0027 said the baker.[129] \u0027I have a half-hundred pounds,\u0027 said Lawrence. \u0027I\u0027ll bet another half-hundred with you that there will be fear on you if you go to the place that I\u0027ll bid you,\u0027 says the baker. \u0027I\u0027ll take your bet,\u0027 said Lawrence, \u0027if only the place is not too far away from me.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s not a mile from the place where you\u0027re standing,\u0027 said the baker; \u0027wait here till the night comes, and then go to the graveyard, and as a sign that you were in it, bring me the goblet that is upon the altar of the old church (cill) that is in the graveyard.\u0027 When the baker made the bet he was certain that he would win, for there was a ghost in the churchyard, and nobody went into it for forty years before that whom he did not kill. When the darkness of the night came, Lawrence put on his sword and went to the burying-ground. He[130] came to the door of the churchyard and struck it with his sword. The door opened, and there came out a great black ram, and two horns on him as long as flails. Lawrence gave him a blow, and he went out of sight, leaving him up to the two ankles in blood. Lawrence went into the old church, got the goblet, came back to the baker\u0027s house, gave him the goblet, and got the bet. Then the baker asked him did he see anything in the churchyard. \u0027I saw a big black ram with long horns on him,\u0027 said Lawrence, \u0027and I gave him a blow which drew as much blood out of him as would swim a boat; sure he must be dead by this time.\u0027 In the morning, the day on the morrow, the baker and a lot of people went to the graveyard and they saw the blood of the black ram at the door. They went to the priest and told him that the black ram was[131] banished out of the churchyard. The priest did not believe them, because the churchyard was shut up forty years before that on account of the ghost that was in it, and neither priest nor friar could banish him. The priest came with them to the door of the churchyard, and when he saw the blood he took courage and sent for Lawrence, and heard the story from his own mouth. Then he sent for his blessing-materials, and desired the people to come in till he read mass for them. The priest went in, and Lawrence and the people after him, and he read mass without the big black ram coming as he used to do. The priest was greatly rejoiced, and gave Lawrence another fifty pounds. On the morning of the next day Lawrence went on his way. He travelled the whole day without seeing a house. About the hour of midnight he came to a great lonely valley, and he saw a large gathering of people[132] looking at two men hurling. Lawrence stood looking at them, as there was a bright light from the moon. It was the good people that were in it, and it was not long until one of them struck a blow on the ball and sent it into Lawrence\u0027s breast. He put his hand in after the ball to draw it out, and what was there in it but the head of a man. When Lawrence got a hold of it, it began screeching, and at last it asked Lawrence— \u0027Are you not afraid?\u0027 \u0027Indeed I am not,\u0027 said Lawrence, and no sooner was the word spoken than both head and people disappeared, and he was left in the glen alone by himself. He journeyed until he came to another town, and when he ate and drank enough, he went out on the road, and was walking until he came to a great house on the side of the road. As the night was closing in, he went in to try if he could get lodging.[133] There was a young man at the door who said to him— \u0027How far are you going, or what are you in search of?\u0027 \u0027I do not know how far I am going, but I am in search of something that will put fear on me,\u0027 said Lawrence. \u0027You have not far to go, then,\u0027 said the young man; \u0027if you stop in that big house on the other side of the road there will be fear put on you before morning, and I\u0027ll give you twenty pounds into the bargain.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll stop in it,\u0027 said Lawrence. The young man went with him, opened the door, and brought him into a large room in the bottom of the house, and said to him, \u0027Put down fire for yourself and I\u0027ll send you plenty to eat and drink.\u0027 He put down a fire for himself, and there came a girl to him and brought him everything that he wanted. He went on very well, until the hour of midnight came, and then he[134] heard a great sound over his head, and it was not long until a stallion and a bull came in and commenced to fight. Lawrence never put to them nor from them, and when they were tired fighting they went out. Lawrence went to sleep, and he never awoke until the young man came in in the morning, and he was surprised when he saw Lawrence alive. He asked him had he seen anything. \u0027I saw a stallion and a bull fighting hard for about two hours,\u0027 said Lawrence. \u0027And weren\u0027t you afraid?\u0027 said the young man. \u0027I was not,\u0027 says Lawrence. \u0027If you wait to-night again, I\u0027ll give you another twenty pounds,\u0027 says the young man. \u0027I\u0027ll wait, and welcome,\u0027 says Lawrence. The second night, about ten o\u0027clock, Lawrence was going to sleep, when two black rams came in and began fighting[135] hard. Lawrence neither put to them nor from them, and when twelve o\u0027clock struck they went out. The young man came in the morning and asked him did he see anything last night. \u0027I saw two black rams fighting,\u0027 said Lawrence. \u0027Were you afraid at all?\u0027 said the young man. \u0027I was not,\u0027 said Lawrence. \u0027Wait to-night, and I\u0027ll give you another twenty pounds,\u0027 says the young man. \u0027All right,\u0027 says Lawrence. The third night he was falling asleep, when there came in a gray old man and said to him— \u0027You are the best hero in Ireland; I died twenty years ago, and all that time I have been in search of a man like you. Come with me now till I show you your riches; I told you when you were watching your mother\u0027s grave that there was great riches waiting for you.\u0027[136] He took Lawrence to a chamber under ground, and showed him a large pot filled with gold, and said to him— \u0027You will have all that if you give twenty pounds to Mary Kerrigan the widow, and get her forgiveness for me for a wrong I did her. Then buy this house, marry my daughter, and you will be happy and rich as long as you live.\u0027 The next morning the young man came to Lawrence and asked him did he see anything last night. \u0027I did,\u0027 said Lawrence, \u0027and it\u0027s certain that there will be a ghost always in it, but nothing in the world would frighten me; I\u0027ll buy the house and the land round it, if you like.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll ask no price for the house, but I won\u0027t part with the land under a thousand pounds, and I\u0027m sure you haven\u0027t that much.\u0027 \u0027I have more than would buy all the land and all the herds you have,\u0027 said Lawrence.[137] When the young man heard that Lawrence was so rich, he invited him to come to dinner. Lawrence went with him, and when the dead man\u0027s daughter saw him she fell in love with him. Lawrence went to the house of Mary Kerrigan and gave her twenty pounds, and got her forgiveness for the dead man. Then he married the young man\u0027s sister and spent a happy life. He died as he lived, without there being fear on him. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3259/89303.html","bookId":566,"book":{"id":566,"title":"Irish Fairy Tales","description":"简介： I am often doubted when I say that the Irish peasantry still believe in fairies.
