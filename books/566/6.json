{"id":17704,"no":6,"title":"A FAIRY ENCHANTMENT","content":"Story-teller—Michael Hart Recorder—W. B. Yeats In the times when we used to travel by canal I was coming down from Dublin. When we came to Mullingar the canal ended, and I began to walk, and stiff and fatigued I was after the slowness. I had some friends with me, and now and then we walked, now and then we rode in a cart. So on till we saw some girls milking a cow, and stopped to joke with them. After a while we asked them for a drink of milk. \u0027We have nothing to[50] put it in here,\u0027 they said, \u0027but come to the house with us.\u0027 We went home with them and sat round the fire talking. After a while the others went, and left me, loath to stir from the good fire. I asked the girls for something to eat. There was a pot on the fire, and they took the meat out and put it on a plate and told me to eat only the meat that came from the head. When I had eaten, the girls went out and I did not see them again. It grew darker and darker, and there I still sat, loath as ever to leave the good fire; and after a while two men came in, carrying between them a corpse. When I saw them I hid behind the door. Says one to the other, \u0027Who\u0027ll turn the spit?\u0027 Says the other, \u0027Michael Hart, come out of that and turn the meat!\u0027 I came out in a tremble and began turning the spit. \u0027Michael Hart,\u0027 says the one who spoke first, \u0027if you let it burn we will have to put you on the spit[51] instead,\u0027 and on that they went out. I sat there trembling and turning the corpse until midnight. The men came again, and the one said it was burnt, and the other said it was done right, but having fallen out over it, they both said they would do me no harm that time; and sitting by the fire one of them cried out, \u0027Michael Hart, can you tell a story?\u0027 \u0027Never a one,\u0027 said I. On that he caught me by the shoulders and put me out like a shot. It was a wild, blowing night; never in all my born days did I see such a night—the darkest night that ever came out of the heavens. I did not know where I was for the life of me. So when one of the men came after me and touched me on the shoulder with a \u0027Michael Hart, can you tell a story now?\u0027—\u0027I can,\u0027 says I. In he brought me, and, putting me by the fire, says \u0027Begin.\u0027 \u0027I have no story but the one,\u0027 says I, \u0027that I was sitting here, and that you two men brought[52] in a corpse and put it on the spit and set me turning it.\u0027 \u0027That will do,\u0027 says he; \u0027you may go in there and lie down on the bed.\u0027 And in I went, nothing loath, and in the morning where was I but in the middle of a green field. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3259/89297.html","bookId":566,"book":{"id":566,"title":"Irish Fairy Tales","description":"简介： I am often doubted when I say that the Irish peasantry still believe in fairies.
