{"id":70957,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"The Administrator shooed them.\\n\\n Raph accepted a cigar.\\n\\n \u0027I intend leaving the Grouping for a time, Lahr,\u0027 he said. \u0027My job necessitates it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We won\u0027t enjoy your going, Raph. I hope it will not be for long.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I hope not. What have we in Common Units?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, ample for your purposes, I\u0027m sure. Where do you intend going?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027To the East Harbor Grouping.\u0027\\n\\n The Administrator nodded and blew out a thoughtful puff of smoke: \u0027Unfortunately, East Harbor has a surplus in their favor registered in our books - I can verify that, if you wish -but the Common Units of Exchange on hand will take care of transportation and necessary expenses.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, that\u0027s fine. But tell me, what is my status on the Community Job Roster?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Um-m-m - I\u0027ll have to get the rolls. You\u0027ll excuse me a moment.\u0027 He trundled away, heaving his great weight across the room and out into the hallway. Raph paused to poke at the youngest of the children who rolled up to him, growling in mock ferocity with gleaming teeth - a black little bundle of thick fur, with the long, childish snout that had not yet broadened away from the shape of the animal ancestry of half a million years earlier.\\n\\n The Administrator returned with a heavy ledger and large spectacles. He opened the ledger meticulously, riffled the pages to the proper place and then drew a careful finger down the columns.\\n\\n He said: There\u0027s only the question of water supply, Raph. You\u0027re due on the Maintenance gang for this next week. There\u0027s nothing else due for at least two months.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll be back before then. Is there any chance of someone subbing for me on the Water Maintenance?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Um-m-m - I\u0027ll get someone. I can always send my oldest. He\u0027s getting to job age and he might as well taste everything. He may like working on the dam.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes? You tell me if he does, then. He can replace me, regularly.\u0027\\n\\n The Administrator smiled gently: \u0027Don\u0027t plan on that, Raph. If he can figure out a way of making sleeping useful to all of us, he\u0027ll certainly take it up as a job. And why are you going to East Harbor Grouping, by the way, if it\u0027s something you care to talk about?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ll laugh, perhaps, but I have just found out that there exist such things as Eekahs.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Eekahs? Yes, I know.\u0027 The Administrator pointed a finger. \u0027Creatures from across the sea! Right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Right! But that\u0027s not all. I\u0027ve come from the Library. I\u0027ve seen trimensional reproductions, Lahr, and they\u0027re Primate Primeval, or almost. They\u0027re primates, anyway, intelligent primates. They\u0027ve got small eyes, flat noses and completely different jawbones - but they\u0027re at least second cousins. I\u0027ve got to see them, Lahr.\u0027\\n\\n The Administrator shrugged. He felt no interest in the matter himself. \u0027Why? I ask out of ignorance, Raph. Does it matter, your seeing them?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Matter?\u0027 Raph was obviously appalled at the question. \u0027Don\u0027t you know what\u0027s been going on these last years? Have you read my archaeology book?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said the Administrator, definitely, \u0027I wouldn\u0027t read it to save myself a turn at Garbage Disposal.\u0027\\n\\n Raph said: \u0027Which probably proves you more suited to Garbage Disposal than archaeology. But never mind. I\u0027ve been fighting single-handed for nearly ten years in favor of my theory that Primate Primeval was an intelligent creature with a developed civilization. I have nothing on my side so far but logical necessity, which is the last thing most archaeologists will accept. They want something solid. They want the remains of a Grouping, or artifacts, structures, books - get it. All I can give them is a skeleton with a huge brain-pan. Stars above, Lahr, what do they expect to survive in ten million years? Metal dies. Paper dies. Film dies.\\n\\n \u0027Only stone lasts, Lahr. And bone that\u0027s turned to stone. I\u0027ve got that. A skull with room for a brain. And stone, too, old sharpened knives. Ground flints.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well,\u0027 said Lahr, \u0027there are your artifacts.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Those are called eoliths, dawn stones. They won\u0027t accept them. They call them natural products, fortuitously shaped by erosion into the shapes they have, the idiots.\u0027\\n\\n Then he grinned with a scientific ferocity: \u0027But if the Eekahs are intelligent primates, I\u0027ve practically proven my case.\"\\n\\n Raph had traveled before, but never eastward, and the decline of agriculture on the road impressed him. In early history, the Gurrow Groupings had been entirely unspecialized. Each had been self-sufficient, and trade was a gesture of friendliness rather than a matter of necessity.\\n\\n And so it was still in most Groupings. His own Grouping, the Red River, was perhaps typical. Some five hundred miles inland, set in lush farm land, agriculture remained centric. The river yielded some fish and there was a well-developed dairy industry. In fact, it was food exports that provided cause for the healthy state of the store of Common Units.\\n\\n As they traveled eastward, however, the Groupings through which they passed paid less and less mind to the shallowing soil and more and more to the smoking factory structures.\\n\\n In the East Harbor Grouping, Raph found a trading center which depended for its prosperity primarily upon ships. It was a more populous Grouping than the average, more densely packed, with houses, on occasion, within a hundred yards of each other.\\n\\n Raph felt an uncomfortable prickling at the thought of living in such close quarters. The docks were even worse, with Gurrows engaged at the huge Community Jobs of loading and unloading.\\n\\n The Administrator of this East Harbor Grouping was a young man, new at his job, overwhelmed with the joy of his work, and beside himself with the pleasure of welcoming a distinguished stranger.\\n\\n Raph sat through an excellent meal, and was treated to a long discourse as to the exact derivation of each dish. To his provincial ears, beef from the Prairie Grouping, potatoes from the Northeast Woods Grouping, coffee from the Isthmus Grouping, wine from the Pacific Grouping, and fruit from the Central Lakes Grouping were something strange and wonderful.\\n\\n Over the cigars - South Island Grouping - he brought up the subject of the Eekahs. The East Harbor Administrator grew solemn and a little uneasy.\\n\\n \u0027The man you want to see is Lernin. He\u0027ll be glad to help you all he can. You say you know something of these Eekahs?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I say I would like to know something. They resemble an extinct species of animal I am familiar with.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then that is your field of interest. I see.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Perhaps you can tell me some of the details of their arrival, Administrator,\u0027 suggested Raph, politely.\\n\\n \u0027I was not Administrator at the time, friend, so that I lack first-hand information, but the records are plain. This group of Eekahs that arrived in their flying-machine... you\u0027ve heard about these aeronautical devices?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes. Well...apparently they were fugitives.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So I have heard. Yet they claim not to be criminals. Isn\u0027t that so?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes. Queer, isn\u0027t it? They admitted that they had been condemned - this was after long and skillful questioning, once we had learned their language - but denied that they were evildoers. Apparently, they had disagreed with their Administrator on principles of policy.\u0027\\n\\n Raph nodded his head knowingly: \u0027Ah, and refused to abide by the common decision. Is that it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027More confusing than that. They insist there was no common decision. They claim that the Administrator decided on policy of his own accord.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And was not replaced?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Apparently those who believe he should are considered criminals - as these were.\u0027\\n\\n There was a frank pause of disbelief. Then Raph said: \u0027Does that sound reasonable to you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, I merely relay to you their words. Of course, the Eekah language is quite a barrier. Some of the sounds can\u0027t be pronounced: words have different meanings according to position in the sentence and according to tiny differences in inflection. And it happens often that Eekah words even when best translated are a complete puzzle.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They must have heen surprised to find Gurrows here,\u0027 suggested Raph, \u0027if they are members of a different genus.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Surprised!\u0027 The Administrator\u0027s voice sank: \u0027I\u0027ll say they were surprised. Now, this information has not been generally published for obvious reasons, so I hope you remember that it\u0027s confidential. These Eekahs killed five Gurrows before they could be disarmed. They had an instrument that expelled metal pellets at high speed by means of controlled explosive chemical reaction. We have duplicated it since. Naturally, under the circumstances, we are not branding them criminals, for it is reasonable to assume that they did not realize we were intelligent beings. Apparently,\u0027 and the Administrator smiled ruefully, \u0027we resemble certain animals in their world. Or so they say.\u0027\\n\\n But Raph was galvanized into a sudden enthusiasm: \u0027Stars above! They said that, did they? Did they go into details? What kind of animals?\u0027\\n\\n The Administrator was taken back: \u0027Well, I don\u0027t know. They give names in their language. What meaning has that? They called us giant \"bears.\"\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Giant what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bears. I haven\u0027t the slightest idea what they are, except presumably that they look like us. I know of no such in America.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bears. Bears.\u0027 Raph stumbled over the word. \u0027That\u0027s interesting. It\u0027s more than interesting. It\u0027s stupendous. Do you know, Administrator, that there is a great dispute among us as to the ancestry of Gurrows? Living animals related to Gurrow sapiens would be of immense importance.\u0027 Raph rubbed his huge hands with pleasure.\\n\\n The Administrator was pleased at the sensation he had caused. He said: \u0027And a puzzling thing in addition is that they call themselves by two names.\u0027\\n\\n Two names?\"\\n\\n \u0027Yes. No one knows the distinction yet, no matter how much the Eekahs explain it to us, except that one is a more general name, and one a more specific. The basis of the difference escapes us.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I see. Which is \"Eekah\"?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That is the specific one. The general one is\u0027 - the Administrator stumbled slowly over the harsh syllables - \u0027Chim-pan zee. There, that\u0027s it. There are a group called Eekahs and there are other groups with other names. But they are all called Chim... what I said before.\u0027\\n\\n The Administrator sought through his mind for other juicy items of miscellany with which he was acquainted, but Raph interrupted him.\\n\\n \u0027May I see Lemin tomorrow?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then I shall do so. Thank you for your courtesy, Administrator.\u0027\\n\\n Lernin was a slight individual. It is doubtful if he weighed more than two hundred and fifty. There was also an imperfection in his walk, a slight lameness. But neither of these facts made much of an impression on Raph once the conversation had begun, for Lernin was a thinker who could impose his vigor upon others.\\n\\n It was Raph whose eagerness dominated the first half of the conversation, and Lernin\u0027s comments were as luminous and as brief as lightning flashes. And then, there was a sudden whirl of the center of gravity, and Lernin took over.\\n\\n \u0027You will excuse me, learned friend,\u0027 Lernin said with a characteristic stiffness that he could make so amiable, \u0027if I find your problem unimportant. No, no\u0027 - he lifted a long-fingered hand - \u0027not, in the uncomplicated talk of the times, merely unimportant to myself because my interest lies elsewhere, but unimportant to the Grouping of all the Groupings - to every single Gurrow from end to end of the world.\u0027\\n\\n The concept was staggering. For a moment, Raph was offended; offended deep in his sense of individuality. It showed in his face.\\n\\n Lernin added quickly: \u0027It may sound impolite, crude, uncivilized. But I must explain. I must explain because you are primarily a social scientist and will understand - perhaps better than we ourselves.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My life-interest,\u0027 said Raph angrily, \u0027is important to myself. I cannot assume those of others in preference.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What I talk about should be the life-interest of all - if only because it may be the means of saving the lives of all of us.\u0027\\n\\n Raph was beginning to suspect all sorts of things from a queer form of joking to the unbalance of mind that sometimes came with age. Yet Lemin was not old.\\n\\n Lernin said, with an Impressive fervor: \u0027The Eekahs of the other world are a danger to us, for they are iiot friendly to us.\u0027\\n\\n And Raph replied naturally: \u0027How do you know?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No one other than myself, my friend, has lived more closely with these Eekahs who have arrived here, and I find them people with minds of emotional content strange to us. I have collected queer facts which we find difficult to interpret, but which point, at any rate, in disquieting directions.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll list a few: Eekahs in organized groups kill one another periodically for obscure reasons. Eekahs find it impossible to live in manner other than those of ants - that is, in huge conglomerate societies - yet find it impossible to allow for the presence of one another. Or, to use the terminology of the social scientists, they are gregarious without being social, just as we Gurrows are social without being gregarious. They have elaborate codes of behavior, which, we are told, are taught to the young, but which are disobeyed in universal practice, for reasons obscure to us. Et cetera. Et cetera. Et cetera.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I am an archaeologist,\u0027 said Raph, stiffly. \u0027These Eekahs are of interest to me biologically only. If the curvature of the thigh bone is known to me, I care little for the curvature of their cultural processes. If I can follow the shape of the skull, it is immaterial to me that the shape of their ethics is mysterious.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t think that their insanities may affect us here?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We are six thousand miles apart, or more, along either ocean,\u0027 said Raph. \u0027We have our world. They have theirs. There is no connection between us.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No connection,\u0027 mused Lernin, \u0027so others have said. No connection at all. Yet Eekahs have reached us, and others may follow. We are told that the other world is dominated by a few, who are in turn dominated by their queer need for security which they confuse with an Eekah word called \"power,\" which, apparently, means the prevailing of one\u0027s own will over the sum of the will of the community. What if this \"power\" should extend to us?\u0027\\n\\n Raph bent his mind to the task. The matter was utterly ridiculous. It seemed impossible to picture the strange concepts.\\n\\n Lernin said: \u0027These Eekahs say that their world and ours in the long past were closer together. They say that there is a well-known scientific hypothesis in their world of a continental drift. That may interest you, since otherwise you might find it difficult to reconcile the existence of fossils of Primate Primeval closely related to living Eekahs six thousand miles away.\u0027\\n\\n And the mists cleared from the archaeologist\u0027s brain as he glanced up with a live interest untroubled by insanities: \u0027Ah, you should have said this sooner.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I say it now as an example of what you may achieve for yourself by joining us and helping us. There is another thing. These Eekahs are physical scientists, like ourselves here in East Harbor, but with a difference dictated by their own cultural pattern. Since they live in hives, they think in hives, and their science is the result of an ant-society. Individually, they are slow and unimaginative; collectively, each supplies a crumb different from that supplied by his fellow - so that a vast structure is erected quickly. Here the individual is infinitely brighter, but he works alone. You, for instance, know nothing of chemistry, I imagine.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A few of the fundamentals, but nothing else,\u0027 admitted Raph. \u0027I leave that, naturally, to the chemist.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, naturally. But I am a chemist. Yet these Eekahs, though my mental inferiors, and no chemists in their own world, know more chemistry than I. For instance, did you know that there exist elements that spontaneously disintegrate?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Impossible,\u0027 exploded Raph. \u0027Elements are eternal, changeless-\u0027\\n\\n Lernin laughed: \u0027So you have been taught. So I have been taught. So I taught others. Yet the Eekahs are right, for in my laboratories I have checked them, and in every detail they are right. Uranium gives rise to a spontaneous radiation. You\u0027ve heard of uranium, of course? And furthermore, I have detected radiations of energy beyond that produced by uranium which must be due to traces of elements unknown to us but described by the Eekahs. And these missing elements fit well into the so-called Periodic Tables some chemists have tried to foist upon the science. Though I do wrong to use the word \"foist\" now,\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well,\u0027 said Raph, \u0027why do you tell me this? Does this, too, help me in my problem?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Perhaps,\u0027 said Lernin, ironically, \u0027you will yet find it a royal bribe. You see, the energy production of uranium is absolutely constant. No known outward change in environment can affect it - and as a result of the loss in energy, uranium slowly turns to lead at an absolutely constant rate. A group of our men is even now using this fact as a basis for a method of determining the age of the earth. You see, to determine the age of a stratum of rock in \u0026#8222; the earth, then, it is but necessary to discover a region in it containing a trace of uranium - a widely spread element - and to determine about it the quantity of lead - and I might here add that the lead produced from uranium differs from ordinary lead and can be easily characterized -and it is then simple to determine the length of time in which that stratum has been solid. And of course, if a fossil is found in that stratum, it is of the same age, am I not correct?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Stars above,\u0027 and Raph rose to his feet in a tremble, \u0027you do not deceive me? It is really possible to do this?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It is possible. It is even easy. I tell you that our great defense, even at this late date, is co-operation in science. We are a group now of many, my friend, from many Groupings, and we want you among us. If you join us, it would be a simple matter to extend our earthage project to such regions as you may indicate - regions rich in fossils. What do you say?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I will help you.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-early-asimov-volume-3/page-14.html","bookId":1748,"book":{"id":1748,"title":"The Early Asimov Volume 3","description":"Storyline: The Early Asimov Volume 3 (Panther Science Fiction) \\n The Early Asimov or, Eleven Years of Trying is a 1972 collection of short stories by Isaac Asimov.
