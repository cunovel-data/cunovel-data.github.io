I\u0027m enough of a psychologist to want to know what\u0027s going on, but I\u0027ve been sent here to protect the Federation, and to the best of my ability I intend doing it - and a dirty job it is. But I can\u0027t help it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You can\u0027t have thought it out. What can you know of the insight it will give us into the basic ideas of psychology? This will amount to a fusion of two Galactic systems, that will send us to heights that will make up in knowledge and power a million times the amount of harm the robots could ever do, if they were metal-electricity supermen.\u0027\\n\\n The secretary shrugged. \u0027Now you\u0027re the one that is playing with faint possibilities.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Listen, I\u0027ll make a deal. Blockade them. Isolate them with your ships. Mount guards. But don\u0027t touch them. Give us more time. Give us a chance. You must!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve thought of that. But I would have to get Congress to agree to that. It would be expensive, you know.\u0027\\n\\n The Board Master flung himself into his chair in wild impatience. \u0027What kind of expense are you talking about? Do you realize the nature of the repayment if we succeed?\u0027\\n\\n Murry considered; then, with a half smile, \u0027What if they develop interstellar travel?\u0027\\n\\n The Board Master said quickly, \u0027Then I\u0027ll withdraw my objections.\u0027 The secretary rose, \u0027I\u0027ll have it out with Congress.\u0027\\n\\n Brand Gorla\u0027s face was carefully emotionless as he watched the Board Master\u0027s stooped back. The cheerful pep talks to the available members of the expedition lacked meat, and he listened to them impatiently.\\n\\n He said, \u0027What are we going to do now?\u0027\\n\\n The Board Master\u0027s shoulders twitched and he didn\u0027t turn. \u0027I\u0027ve sent for Theor Realo. That little fool left for the Eastern Continent last week -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027\\n\\n The older man blazed at the interruption. \u0027How can I understand anything that freak does! Don\u0027t you see that Murry\u0027s right? He\u0027s a psychic abnormality. We had no business leaving him unwatched. If I had ever thought of looking at him twice, I wouldn\u0027t have. He\u0027s coming back now, though, and he\u0027s going to stay back.\u0027 His voice fell to a mumble. \u0027Should have been back two hours ago.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s an impossible position, sir,\u0027 said Brand, flatly.\\n\\n \u0027Think so?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well- Do you think Congress will stand for an indefinite patrol off the robot world? It runs into money, and average Galactic citizens aren\u0027t going to see it as worth the taxes. The psychological equations degenerate into the axioms of common sense. In fact, I don\u0027t see why Murry agreed to consult Congress.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t you?\u0027 The Board Master finally faced his junior. \u0027Well, the fool considers himself a psychologist, Galaxy help us, and that\u0027s his weak point. He flatters himself that he doesn\u0027t want to destroy the robot world in his heart, but that it\u0027s the good of the Federation that requires it. And he\u0027ll jump at any reasonable compromise. Congress won\u0027t agree to it indefinitely, you don\u0027t have to point that out to me.\u0027 He was talking quietly, patiently. \u0027But I will ask for ten years, two years, six months -as much as I can get. I\u0027ll get something. In that time, we\u0027ll learn new facts about the world. Somehow we\u0027ll strengthen our case and renew the agreement when it expires. We\u0027ll save the project yet.\u0027\\n\\n There was a short silence and the Board Master added slowly and bitterly, \u0027And that\u0027s where Theor Realo plays a vital part.\u0027\\n\\n Brand Gorla watched silently, and waited. The Board Master said, \u0027On that one point, Murry saw what we didn\u0027t. Realo is a psychological cripple, and is our real clue to the whole affair. If we study him, we\u0027ll have a rough picture of what the robot is like, distorted of course, since his environment has been a hostile, unfriendly one. But we ca0 make allowance for that, estimate his nature in a- Ahh, I\u0027m tired of the whole subject.\u0027\\n\\n The signal box flashed, and the Board Master sighed. \u0027Well, he\u0027s here. All right, Gorla, sit down, you make me nervous. Let\u0027s take a look at him.\u0027\\n\\n Theor Realo came through the door like a comet and brought himself to a panting halt in the middle of the floor. He looked from one to the other with weak, peering eyes.\\n\\n \u0027How did all this happen?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All what?\u0027 said the Board Master coldly. \u0027Sit down. I want to ask you some questions.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. You first answer me,\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sit down!\u0027\\n\\n Realo sat. His eyes were brimming. \u0027They\u0027re going to destroy the robot world.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t worry about that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But you said they could if the robots discovered interstellar travel. You said so. You fool. Don\u0027t you see -\u0027 He was choking.\\n\\n The Board Master frowned uneasily. \u0027Will you calm down and talk sense?\u0027\\n\\n The albino gritted his teeth and forced the words out. \u0027But they\u0027ll have interstellar travel before long.\u0027\\n\\n And the two psychologists shot toward the little man.\\n\\n \u0027What!!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well... well, what do you think?\u0027 Realo sprang upward with all the fury of desperation. \u0027Did you think I landed in a desert or in the middle of an ocean and explored a world all by myself? Do you think life is a storybook? I was captured as soon as I landed and taken to the big city. At least, I think it was a big city. It was different from our kind. It had - But I won\u0027t tell you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Never mind the city,\u0027 shrieked the Board Master. \u0027You were captured. Go ahead.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They studied me. They studied my machine. And then, one night, I left, to tell the Federation. They didn\u0027t know I left. They didn\u0027t want me to leave.\u0027 His voice broke. \u0027And I would have stayed as soon as not, but the Federation had to know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did you tell them anything about your ship?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How could I? I\u0027m no mechanic. I don\u0027t know the theory or construction. But I showed them how to work the controls and let them look at the motors. That\u0027s all.\u0027\\n\\n Brand Gorla said, to himself mostly, \u0027Then they\u0027ll never get it. That isn\u0027t enough.\u0027\\n\\n The albino\u0027s voice raised itself in sudden shrieking triumph. \u0027Oh, yes, they will. I know them. They\u0027re machines, you know. They\u0027ll work on that problem. And they\u0027ll work. And they\u0027ll work. And they\u0027ll never quit. And they\u0027ll get it. They got enough out of me. I\u0027ll bet they got enough.\u0027\\n\\n The Board Master looked long, and turned away - wearily. \u0027Why didn\u0027t you tell us?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because you took my world away from me. I discovered it -by myself - all by myself. And after I had done all the real work, and invited you in, you threw me out. All you had for me was complaints that I had landed on the world and might have ruined everything by interference. Why should I tell you? Find out for yourselves if you\u0027re so wise, that you could afford to kick me around.\u0027\\n\\n The Board Master thought bitterly, \u0027Misfit! Inferiority complex! Persecution mania! Nice! It all fits in, now that we\u0027ve bothered to take our eyes off the horizon and see what was under our nose. And now it\u0027s all ruined.\u0027\\n\\n He said, \u0027All right, Realo, we all lose. Go away.\u0027\\n\\n Brand Gorla said tightly, \u0027All over? Really all over?\u0027\\n\\n The Board Master answered, \u0027Really all over. The original experiment, as such, is over. The distortions created by Realo\u0027s visit will easily be large enough to make the plans we are studying here a dead language. And besides - Murry is right. If they have interstellar travel, they\u0027re dangerous.\u0027\\n\\n Realo was shouting, \u0027But you\u0027re not going to destroy them. You can\u0027t destroy them. They haven\u0027t hurt anyone.\u0027\\n\\n There was no answer, and he raved on, \u0027I\u0027m going back. I\u0027ll warn them. They\u0027ll be prepared. I\u0027ll warn them.\u0027\\n\\n He was backing toward the door, his thin, white hair bristling, his red-rimmed eyes bulging.\\n\\n The Board Master did not move to stop him when he dashed out.\\n\\n \u0027Let him go. It was his lifetime. I don\u0027t care any more.\u0027\\n\\n Theor Realo smashed toward the robot world at an acceleration that was half choking him.\\n\\n Somewhere ahead was the dustspeck of an isolated world with artificial imitations of humanity struggling along in an experiment that had died. Struggling blindly toward a new goal of interstellar travel that was to be their death sentence.\\n\\n He was heading toward that world, toward the same city in which he had been \u0027studied\u0027 the first time. He remembered it well. Its name was the first words of their language he had learned.\\n\\n New York!\\n\\n On July 26, 1943, which was a Monday, I had one of the rare days off I could take during wartime. (It was, after all, my first wedding anniversary.) I was in New York that day, and I visited Campbell just as in the good old days. I discussed with him another story in the \u0027Foundation\u0027 series, as well as another in the \u0027positronic robot\u0027 series. From then on, I always saw Campbell on the rare days when I was in New York on a weekday, and of course we corresponded regularly.\\n\\n I was definitely back at writing. Output was low, but during the remaining war years I wrote two positronic robot stories, \u0027Catch That Rabbit\u0027 and \u0027Paradoxical Escape,\u0027 which appeared in the February 1944 and August 1945 issues of Astounding, respectively. Both were eventually included in I, Robot. (The latter story appears in /, Robot under the title of \u0027Escape.\u0027 The word \u0027Paradoxical\u0027 had been added by Campbell in one of his few title changes, and I didn\u0027t like it.)\\n\\n I also wrote no less than four stories of the \u0027Foundation\u0027 series during those same years. These were \u0027The Big and the Little,\u0027 \u0027The Wedge,\u0027 \u0027Dead Hand\u0027 and \u0027The Mule.\u0027 All appeared in Astounding, of course, the first three in the August 1944, October 1944, and April 1945 issues, respectively.\\n\\n \u0027The Mule\u0027 set several records for me. It was the longest story I had ever written up to that time - fifty thousand words long. Yet even so, and despite the fact that I had to work on it in small scraps of time left over from job and marriage, I managed to complete it in three and a half months. It was submitted on May 21, 1945, and was accepted on the twenty-ninth. (Indeed, throughout the war I never got a single rejection, or even a delayed acceptance. Nor did I submit to anyone but Campbell.)\\n\\n What\u0027s more, at the beginning of 1944 Campbell raised his basic rate to one and a half cents a word and some months later to a cent and three quarters. For \u0027The Mule\u0027 I received a check at the higher rate, for $875. It was by far the largest check I ever received for a single story. By the end of the war, in fact, I was making half as much money writing in my spare time as I was making at my N.A.E.S. job, even though I had been promoted and was receiving sixty dollars a week by the end of the war.\\n\\n Then, too, \u0027The Mule\u0027 was the first story I ever had published as a serial. It appeared in two parts in the November and December 1945 issues of Astounding.\\n\\n Of the wartime \u0027Foundation\u0027 stories, \u0027The Big and the Little\u0027 and \u0027The Wedge\u0027 are included in Foundation, while \u0027Dead Hand\u0027 and \u0027The Mule,\u0027 together, make up all of Foundation and Empire.\\n\\n During the two years between mid-1943 and mid-1945, I wrote only one story that was neither one of the \u0027Foundation\u0027 series nor one of the \u0027Positronic robot\u0027 series, and that one was inspired directly by the N.A.E.S. This story was \u0027Blind Alley,\u0027 which was written during September and early October of 1944. It was submitted to Campbell on October 10, and accepted on the twentieth.\\n\\n Blind Alley\\n\\n Only once in Galactic History was an intelligent race of non-Humans discovered-\\n\\n \"Essays on History.\u0027 by Ligurn Vier\\n\\n I\\n\\n From: Bureau for the Outer Provinces\\n\\n To: Loodun Antyok, Chief Public Administrator, A-8\\n\\n Subject: Civilian Supervisor of Cepheus 18, Administrative Position as, References:\\n\\n (a) Act of Council 2515, of the year 971 of the Galactic Empire, entitled, \u0027Appointment of Officials of the Administra tive Service, Methods for, Revision of.\u0027\\n\\n (b) Imperial Directive, Ja 2374, dated 243/975 G.E.\\n\\n 1. By authorization of reference (a), you are hereby ap pointed to the subject position. The authority of said position as Civilian Supervisor of Cepheus 18 will extend over non- Human subjects of the Emperor living upon the planet under the terms of autonomy set forth in reference (b).\\n\\n 2. The duties of the subject position shall comprise the gen eral supervision of all non-Human internal affairs, co-ordina tion of authorized government investigating and reporting committees, and the preparation of semiannual reports on all phases of non-Human affairs.\\n\\n C. Morily, Chief,\\n\\n BuOuProv, 12/977 G.E.\\n\\n Loodun Antyok had listened carefully, and now he shook his round head mildly, \u0027Friend, I\u0027d like to help you, but you\u0027ve grabbed the wrong dog by the ears. You\u0027d better take this up with the Bureau.\u0027\\n\\n Tomor Zammo flung himself back into his chair, rubbed his beak of a nose fiercely, thought better of whatever he was going to say, and answered quietly, \u0027Logical, but not practical. I can\u0027t make a trip to Trantor now. You\u0027re the Bureau\u0027s representative on Cepheus 18. Are you entirely helpless?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, even as Civilian Supervisor, I\u0027ve got to work within the limits of Bureau policy.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good,\u0027 Zammo cried, \u0027then, tell me what Bureau policy is. I head a scientific investigating committee, under direct Imperial authorization with, supposedly, the widest powers; yet at every angle in the road I am pulled up short by the civilian authorities with only the parrot shriek of \"Bureau policy\" to justify themselves. What is Bureau policy? I haven\u0027t received a decent definition yet.\u0027\\n\\n Antyok\u0027s gaze was level and unruffled. He said, \"As I see it -and this is not official, so you can\u0027t hold me to it - Bureau policy consists in treating the non-Humans as decently as possible.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then, what authority have they -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ssh! No use raising your voice. As a matter of fact, His Imperial Majesty is a humanitarian and a disciple of the philosophy of Aurelion. I can tell you quietly that it is pretty well-known that it is the Emperor himself who first suggested that this world be established. You can bet that Bureau policy will stick pretty close to Imperial notions. And you can bet that I can\u0027t paddle my way against that sort of current.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, m\u0027boy,\u0027 the physiologist\u0027s fleshy eyelids quivered, \u0027if you take that sort of attitude, you\u0027re going to lose your job. No, I won\u0027t have you kicked out. That\u0027s not what I mean at all. Your job will just fade out from under you, because nothing is going to be accomplished here!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Really? Why?\u0027 Antyok was short, pink, and pudgy, and his plump-cheeked face usually found it difficult to put on display any expression other than one of bland and cheerful politeness - but it looked grave now.\\n\\n \u0027You haven\u0027t been here long. I have.\u0027 Zammo scowled. \u0027Mind if I smoke?\u0027 The cigar in his hand was gnarled and strong and was puffed to life carelessly.\\n\\n He continued roughly, \u0027There\u0027s no place here for humani-tarianism, administrator. You\u0027re treating non-Humans as if they were Humans, and it won\u0027t work. In fact, I don\u0027t like the word \"non-Human.\" They\u0027re animals.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027re intelligent,\u0027 interjected Antyok, softly.\\n\\n \u0027Well, intelligent animals, then. I presume the two terms are not mutually exclusive. Alien intelligences mingling in the same space won\u0027t work, anyway.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you propose killing them off?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Galaxy, no!\u0027 He gestured with his cigar. \u0027I propose we look upon them as objects for study, and only that. We could learn a good deal from these animals if we were allowed to. Knowledge, I might point out, that would be used for the immediate benefit of the human race. There\u0027s humanity for you. There\u0027s the good of the masses, if it\u0027s this spineless cult of Aurelion that interests you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What, for instance, do you refer to?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027To take the most obvious - You have heard of their chemistry, I take it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Antyok admitted. \u0027I have leafed through most of the reports on the non-Humans published in the last ten years. I expect to go through more.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hmp. Well- Then, all I need say is that their chemical therapy is extremely thorough. For instance, I have witnessed personally the healing of a broken bone - what passes for a broken bone with them, I mean - by the use of a pill. The bone was whole in fifteen minutes. Naturally, none of their drugs are any earthly use on Humans. Most would kill quickly. But if we found out how they worked on the non-Humans - on the animals-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, yes. I see the significance.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, you do. Come, that\u0027s gratifying. A second point is that these animals communicate hi an unknown manner.\u0027\\n\\n Telepathy!\u0027\\n\\n The scientist\u0027s mouth twisted, as he ground out, \u0027Telepathy! Telepathy! Telepathy! Might as well say by witch brew. Nobody knows anything about telepathy except its name. What is the mechanism of telepathy? What is the physiology and the physics of it? I would like to find out, but I can\u0027t. Bureau policy, if I listen to you, forbids.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-early-asimov-volume-3/page-9.html","bookId":1748,"book":{"id":1748,"title":"The Early Asimov Volume 3","description":"Storyline: The Early Asimov Volume 3 (Panther Science Fiction) \\n The Early Asimov or, Eleven Years of Trying is a 1972 collection of short stories by Isaac Asimov.
