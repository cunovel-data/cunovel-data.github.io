{"id":70948,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"\u0027Ah, there. Greetin\u0027s,\u0027 said de Meister, and brushed past.\\n\\n .Graham\u0027s dull eyes stared, and then fired high, as an animal snarl burst from his lips. He took up that gorilla posture, so comforting to red-blooded American males at moments like this, and circled the slightly-confused detective.\\n\\n \u0027My dear fellow, are you ill?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I,\u0027 explained Graham, \u0027am not ill, but you will soon be past all interest in that, for I am going to bathe my hands in your heart\u0027s reddest blood.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But I say, you\u0027ll only have to wash them afterwards. It would be such an obvious clue, wouldn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Enough of this gay banter. Have you any last words?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not particularly.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s just as well. I\u0027m not interested in your last words.\"\\n\\n He thundered into action, bearing down upon the unfortunate de Meister like a bull elephant. De Meister faded to the left, shot out an arm and a foot, and Graham described a parabolic arc that ended in the total destruction of an end table, a vase of flowers, a fish-bowl, and a five-foot section of wall.\\n\\n Graham blinked, and brushed away a curious goldfish from his left eyebrow.\\n\\n \u0027My dear fellow,\u0027 murmured de Meister, \u0027oh, my dear fellow.\u0027\\n\\n Too late, Graham remembered that passage in Pistol Parade:\\n\\n De Meister\u0027s arms were whipcord lightning, as with sure, rapid thrusts, he rendered the two thugs helpless. Not by brute force, but by his expert knowledge of judo, he defeated them easily without hastening his breath. The thugs groaned in pain.\\n\\n Graham groaned in pain.\\n\\n He lifted his right thigh an inch or so to let his femur slip back into place.\\n\\n \u0027Hadn\u0027t you better get up, old chap?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I will stay here,\u0027 said Graham with dignity, \u0027and contemplate the floor in profile view, until such time as it suits me or until such time as I find myself capable of moving a muscle. I don\u0027t care which. And now, before I proceed to take further measures with you, what the hell do you want?\u0027\\n\\n Reginald de Meister adjusted his monocle to a nicety. \u0027You know, I suppose, that MacDunlap\u0027s ultimatum expires tomorrow?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And you and he with it, I trust.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You will not reconsider.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ha!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Really,\u0027 de Meister sighed, \u0027this is borin\u0027 no end. You have made things comfortable for me in this world. After all, in your books you\u0027ve made me well-known in all the clubs and better restaurants, the bosom friend, y\u0027know, of the mayor and commissioner of police, the owner of a Park Avenue penthouse and a magnificent art collection. And it all lingers over, old chap. Really quite affectin\u0027.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It is remarkable,\u0027 mused Graham, \u0027the intensity with which I am not listening and the distinctness with which I do not hear a word you say.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Still,\u0027 said de Meister, \u0027there is no denyin\u0027 my book world suits me better. It is somehow more fascinatin\u0027, freer from dull logic, more apart from the necessities of the world. In short, I must go back, and to active participation. You have till tomorrow! \u0027\\n\\n Graham hummed a gay little tune with flat little notes.\\n\\n \u0027Is this a new threat, de Meister?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It is the old threat intensified. I\u0027m going to rob you of every vestige of your personality. And eventually public oninion will force you to write as, to paraphrase you, de Meister\u0027s Compleat Stooge. Did you see the name the newspaper chappies pinned on you today, old man?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, Mr. Filthy de Meister, and did you read a half-column item on page ten in the same paper. I\u0027ll read it for you: \"Noted Criminologist in 1-A. Will be inducted shortly draft board says.\"\u0027\\n\\n For a moment, de Meister said and did nothing. And then, one after another, he did the following things: removed his monocle slowly, sat down heavily, rubbed his chin abstractedly, and lit a cigarette after long and careful tamping. Each of these, Graham Dorn\u0027s trained authorial eye recognized as singly representing perturbation and distress on the part of his character.\\n\\n And never, in any of his books, did Graham remember a time when de Meister had gone through all four consecutively.\\n\\n Finally, de Meister spoke. \u0027Why you had to bring up draft registrations in your last book, I really don\u0027t know. This urge to be topical; this fiendish desire to be up to the minute with the news is the curse of the mystery novel. A true mystery is timeless; should have no relation to current events; should-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There is one way,\u0027 said Graham, \u0027to escape induction -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You might at least have mentioned a deferred classification on some vital ground.\u0027\\n\\n There is one way,\u0027 said Graham, \u0027to escape induction -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Criminal negligence,\u0027 said de Meister.\\n\\n \u0027Look! Go back to the books and you\u0027ll never be filled with lead.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Write them and I\u0027ll do it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Think of the war.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Think of your ego.\u0027\\n\\n Two strong men stood face to face (or would have, if Graham weren\u0027t still horizontal) and neither flinched.\\n\\n Impasse!\\n\\n And the sweet, feminine voice of June Billings interrupted and snapped the tension:\\n\\n \u0027May I ask, Graham Dorn, what you are doing on the floor. It\u0027s been swept today and you\u0027re not complimenting me by attempting to improve the job.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I am not sweeping the floor. If you looked carefully,\u0027 replied Graham gently, \u0027you would see that your own adored fiance is lying here a mass of bruises and a hotbed of pains and aches.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve ruined my end table!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve broken my leg.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And my best lamp.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And two ribs.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And my fishbowl.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And my Adam\u0027s apple.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And you haven\u0027t introduced your friend,\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And my cervical verte- What friend?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027This friend.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Friend! Ha!\u0027 And a mist came over his eyes. She was so young, so fragile to come into contact with hard, brutal facts of life. \u0027This,\u0027 he muttered brokenly, \u0027is Reginald de Meister.\u0027\\n\\n De Meister at this point broke a cigarette sharply in two, a gesture pregnant with the deepest emotion.\\n\\n June said slowly. \u0027Why - why, you\u0027re different from what I had thought.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How had you expected me to look?\u0027 asked de Meister, in soft, thrilling tones.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. Differently than you do - from the stories I heard.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You remind me, somehow, Miss Billings, of Letitia Reynolds.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think so. Graham said he drew her from me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A very poor imitation, Miss Billings. Devastatin\u0027ly poor.\u0027\\n\\n They were six inches apart now, eyes fixed with a mutual glue, and Graham yelled sharply. He sprang upright as memory smote^him a nasty smite on the forehead.\\n\\n A passage from Case of the Muddy Overshoe occurred to him. Likewise one from The Primrose Murders. Also one from The Tragedy of Hartley Manor, Death of a Hunter, White Scorpion and, to put it in a small nutshell, from every one of the others.\\n\\n The passage read:\\n\\n There was a certain fascination about de Meister that appealed irresistibly to women.\\n\\n And June Billings was - as it had often, in Graham\u0027s idler moments, occurred to him - a woman.\\n\\n And fascination simply gooed out of her ears and coated the floor six inches deep.\\n\\n \u0027Get out of this room, June,\u0027 he ordered.\\n\\n \u0027I will not.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There is something I must discuss with Mr. de Meister, man to man. I demand that you leave this room.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Please go, Miss Billings,\u0027 said de Meister.\\n\\n June hesitated, and in a very small voice said, \u0027Very well.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hold on,\u0027 shouted Graham. \u0027Don\u0027t let him order you about, I demand that you stay.\u0027\\n\\n She closed the door very gently behind her.\\n\\n The two men faced each other. There was that in either pair of eyes that indicated a strong man brought to bay. There was stubborn, undying antagonism; no quarter; no compromise. It was exactly the sort of situation Graham Dorn always presented his readers with, when two strong men fought for one hand, one heart, one girl.\\n\\n The two said simultaneously, \u0027Let\u0027s make a deal!\u0027\\n\\n Graham said, \u0027You have convinced me, Reggie. Our public needs us. Tomorrow I shall begin another de Meister story. Let us shake hands and forget the past.\u0027\\n\\n De Meister struggled with his emotion. He laid his hand on Graham\u0027s lapel, \u0027My dear fellow, it is I who have been convinced by your logic. I can\u0027t allow you to sacrifice yourself for me. There are great things in you that must be brought out. Write your coal-mining novels. They count, not I.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I couldn\u0027t, old chap. Not after all you\u0027ve done for me, and all you\u0027ve meant to me. Tomorrow we start anew.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Graham, my - my spiritual father, I couldn\u0027t allow it. Do you think I have no feelings, filial feelings -in a spiritual sort of way.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But the war, think of the war. Mangled limbs. Blood. All that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I must stay. My country needs me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But if I stop writing, eventually you will stop existing. I can\u0027t allow that\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, that!\u0027 De Meister laughed with a careless elegance. \u0027Things have changed since. So many people believe in my existence now that my grip upon actual existence has become too firm to be broken. I don\u0027t have to worry about Limbo any more.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh.\u0027 Graham clenched his teeth and spoke in searing sibilants: \u0027So that\u0027s your scheme, you snake. Do you suppose I don\u0027t see you\u0027re stuck on June?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Look here, old chap,\u0027 said de Meister haughtily. \u0027I can\u0027t permit you to speak slightingly of a true and honest love. I love June and she loves me -I know it. And if you\u0027re going to be stuffy and Victorian about it, you can swallow some nitroglycerine and tap yourself with a hammer.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll nitro-glycerine you! Because I\u0027m going home tonight and beginning another de Meister story. You\u0027ll be part of it and you\u0027ll get back into it, and what do you think of that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nothing, because you can\u0027t write another de Meister story. I\u0027m too real now, and you can\u0027t control me just like that. And what do you think of that?\u0027\\n\\n It took Graham Dorn a week to make up his mind what to think of that, and then his thoughts were completely and start-lingly unprintable.\\n\\n In fact, it was impossible to write.\\n\\n That is, startling ideas occurred to him for great novels, emotional dramas, epic poems, brilliant essays - but he couldn\u0027t write anything about Reginald de Meister.\\n\\n The typewriter was simply fresh out of Capital R\u0027s.\\n\\n Graham wept, cursed, tore his hair, and anointed his finger tips with liniment. He tried typewriter, pen, pencil, crayon, charcoal and blood.\\n\\n He could not write.\\n\\n The doorbell rang, and Graham threw it open.\\n\\n MacDunlap stumbled in, falling over the first drifts of torn paper directly into Graham\u0027s arms.\\n\\n Graham let him drop. \u0027Ha!\u0027 he said, with frozen dignity. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-early-asimov-volume-3/page-5.html","bookId":1748,"book":{"id":1748,"title":"The Early Asimov Volume 3","description":"Storyline: The Early Asimov Volume 3 (Panther Science Fiction) \\n The Early Asimov or, Eleven Years of Trying is a 1972 collection of short stories by Isaac Asimov.
