{"id":70947,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\u0027Do you want him around?\u0027\n \u0027God forbid,\u0027 MacDunlap said between shudders. \u0027Next to him, my brother-in-law is an angel.\u0027\n \u0027He has no business outside my books.\u0027\n \u0027For my part, he has no business inside them. Since I started reading your manuscripts, my doctor added kidney pills and cough syrups to my medicines.\u0027 He looked at his watch, and took a kidney pill. \u0027My worst enemy should be a book publisher only a year.\u0027\n \u0027Then why,\u0027 asked Graham patiently, \u0027don\u0027t you want to get rid of de Meister?\u0027\n \u0027Because he is publicity.\u0027\n Graham stared blankly.\n \u0027Look! What other writer has a real detective? All the others are fictional. Everyone knows that. But yours - yours is real. We can let him solve cases and have big newspaper write-ups. He\u0027ll make the Police Department look silly. He\u0027ll make -\u0027\n \u0027That,\u0027 interrupted Graham, categorically, \u0027is by all odds the most obscene proposal I have ever had my ears manured with.\u0027\n \u0027It will make money.\u0027\n \u0027Money isn\u0027t everything.\u0027\n \u0027Name one thing it isn\u0027t...Shh!\u0027 He kicked a near-fracture\n into Graham\u0027s left ankle and rose to his feet with a convulsive smile, \u0027Mr. de Meister!\u0027\n \u0027Sorry, old dear,\u0027 came a lethargic voice. \u0027Cou\u0027dn\u0027t quite make it, you know. Loads of engagements. Must have been most borin\u0027 for you.\u0027\n Graham Dom\u0027s ears quivered spasmodically. He looked over his shoulder and reeled backward as far as a person could reel while in a sitting position. Reginald de Meister had sprouted a monocle since his last visitation, and his monocular glance was calculated to freeze blood.\n De Meister\u0027s greeting was casual. \u0027My dear Watson! So glad to meet you. Overjoyed deucedly.\u0027\n \u0027Why don\u0027t you go to hell?\u0027 Graham asked curiously.\n \u0027My dear fellow. Oh, my dear fellow.\u0027\n MacDunlap crackled, \u0027That\u0027s what I like. Jokes! Fun! Makes everything pleasant to start with. Now shall we get down to business?\u0027\n \u0027Certainly. The dinner is on the way, I trust? Then I\u0027ll just order a bottle of wine. The usual, Henry.\u0027 The waiter ceased hovering, flew away, and skimmed back with a bottle that opened and gurgled into a glass.\n De Meister sipped delicately, \u0027So nice of you, old chap, to make me a habitue of this place in your stories. It holds true even now, and it is most convenient. The waiters all know me. Mr. MacDunlap, I take it you have convinced Mr. Dorn of the necessity of continuing the de Meister stories.\"\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said MacDunlap.\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Graham.\n \u0027Don\u0027t mind him,\u0027 said MacDunlap. \u0027He\u0027s temperamental. You know these authors.\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t mind him,\u0027 said Graham. \u0027He\u0027s microcephalic. You know these publishers.\u0027\n \u0027Look, old chappie. I take it MacDunlap hasn\u0027t pointed out to you the unpleasanter side of acting stubborn.\u0027\n \u0027For instance what, old stinkie?\u0027 asked Graham, courteously.\n \u0027Well, have you ever been haunted?\u0027\n \u0027Like coming behind me and saying, Boo!\"\n \u0027My dear fellow, I say. I\u0027m much more subtle than that. I can really haunt one in modern, up-to-date methods. For instance, have you ever had your individuality submerged?\u0027\n He snickered.\n There was something familiar about that snicker. Graham suddenly remembered. It was on page 103 of Murder Rides the Range:\n His lazy eyelids flicked down and up. He laughed lightly and melodiously, and though he said not a word, Hank Marslowe cowered. There was hidden menace and hidden power in that light laugh, and somehow the burly rancher did not dare reach for his guns.\n To Graham it still sounded like a nasty snicker, but he cowered, and did not dare reach for his guns.\n MacDunlap plunged through the hole the momentary silence had created.\n \u0027You see, Graham. Why play around with ghosts? Ghosts aren\u0027t reasonable things. They\u0027re not human! If it\u0027s more royalties, you want -\u0027\n Graham fired up. \u0027Will you refrain from speaking of money? From now on, I write only great novels of tearing human emotions.\u0027\n MacDunlap\u0027s flushed face changed suddenly.\n \u0027No,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027In fact, to change the subject just a moment\u0027 - and Graham\u0027s tone became surpassingly sweet, as the words got all sticky with maple syrup - \u0027I have a manuscript here for you to look at.\u0027\n He grasped the perspiring MacDunlap by the lapel firmly. \u0027It is a novel that is the work of five years. A novel that will grip you with its intensity. A novel that will shake you to the core of your being. A novel that will open a new world. A novel that will -\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 said MacDunlap.\n \u0027A novel that will blast the falseness of this world. A novel that pierces to the truth. A novel-\u0027\n MacDunlap, being able to stretch his hand no higher, took the manuscript.\n \u0027No,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Why the bloody hell don\u0027t you read it?\u0027 inquired Graham.\n \u0027Now?\u0027\n \u0027Well, start it.\u0027\n \u0027Look, supposing I read it tomorrow, or even the next day. I have to take my cough syrup now.\u0027\n \u0027You haven\u0027t coughed once since I got here.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll let you know immediately -\u0027\n \u0027This,\u0027 said Graham, \u0027is the first page. Why don\u0027t you begin -it? It will grip you instantly.\u0027\n MacDunlap read two paragraphs and said, \u0027Is this laid in a coal-mining town?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027Then I can\u0027t read it. I\u0027m allergic to coal dust.\u0027\n \u0027But it\u0027s not real coal dust, Macldiot.\u0027\n \u0027That,\u0027 pointed out MacDunlap, \u0027is what you said about de Meister.\u0027\n Reginald de Meister tapped a cigarette carefully on the back of his hand in a subtle manner which Graham immediately recognized as betokening a sudden decision.\n \u0027That is all devastatin\u0027ly borin\u0027, you know. Not quite gettin\u0027 to the point, you might say. Go ahead, MacDunlap, this is no time for half measures.\u0027\n MacDunlap girded his spiritual loins and said, \u0027All right Mister Dorn, with you it\u0027s no use being nice. Instead of de Meister, I\u0027m getting coal dust. Instead of the best publicity in fifty years, I\u0027m getting social significance. All right, Mister Smartaleck Dorn, if in one week you don\u0027t come to terms with me, good terms, you will be blacklisted in every reputable publishing firm in the United States and foreign parts.\u0027 He shook his finger and added in a shout, \u0027Including Scandinavian.\u0027\n Graham Dorn laughed lightly, \u0027Pish,\u0027 he said, \u0027tush. I happen to be an officer of the Author\u0027s Union, and if you try to push me around I\u0027ll have you blacklisted. How do you like that?\u0027\n \u0027I like it fine. Because supposing I can prove you\u0027re a plagiarist.\u0027\n \u0027Me,\u0027 gasped Graham, recovering narrowly from merry suffocation. \u0027Me, the most original writer of the decade.\u0027\n \u0027Is that so? And maybe you don\u0027t remember that in each case you write up, you casually mention de Meister\u0027s notebooks on previous cases.\u0027\n \u0027So what?\u0027\n \u0027So he has them. Reginald, my boy, show Mister Dorn your notebook of your last case. - You see that. That\u0027s Mystery of the Milestones and it has, in detail, every incident in your book - and dated the year before the book was published. Very authentic.\u0027\n \u0027Again so what?\u0027\n \u0027Have you maybe got the right to copy his notebook and call it an original murder mystery?\u0027\n \u0027Why, you case of mental poliomyelitis, that notebook is my invention.\u0027\n \u0027Who says so? It\u0027s de Meister\u0027s handwriting, as any expert can prove. And maybe you have a piece of paper, some little contract or agreement, you know, that gives you the right to use his notebooks?\u0027\n \u0027How can I have an agreement with a mythical personage?\u0027\n \u0027What mythical personage?\u0027\n \u0027You and I know de Meister doesn\u0027t exist.\u0027\n \u0027Ah, but does the jury know? When I testify that I took three strong liver pills and he didn\u0027t disappear, what twelve men will say he doesn\u0027t exist?\u0027\n \u0027This is blackmail.\u0027\n \u0027Certainly. I\u0027ll give you a week. Or in other words, seven days.\u0027\n Graham Dorn turned desperately to de Meister. \u0027You\u0027re in on this, too. In my books I give you the keenest sense of honor. Is this honorable?\u0027\n De Meister shrugged. \u0027My dear fellow. All this - and haunting, too.\"\n Graham rose.\n \u0027Where are you going?\u0027\n \u0027Home to write you a letter.\u0027 Graham\u0027s brows beetled defiantly. \u0027And this time I\u0027ll mail it. I\u0027m not giving in. I\u0027ll fight to the last ditch. And, de Meister, you let loose with one single little haunt and I\u0027ll rip your head out of its socket and spurt the blood all over MacDunlap\u0027s new suit.\u0027\n He stalked out, and as he disappeared through the door, de Meister disappeared through nothing at all.\n MacDunlap let out a soft yelp and then took a liver pill, a kidney pill, and a tablespoon of cough syrup in rapid succession.\n Graham Dorn sat in June\u0027s front parlor, and having long since consumed his fingernails, was starting on the first knuckles.\n June, at the moment, was not present, and this, Graham felt, was just as well. A dear girl; in fact, a dear, sweet girl. But his mind was not on her.\n It was concerned instead with a miasmic series of flashbacks over the preceding six days:\n - Say, Graham, I met your side-kick at the club yesterday. You know, de Meister. Got an awful shock. I always had the idea he was a sort of Sherlock Holmes that didn\u0027t exist. That\u0027s one on me, boy. Didn\u0027t know - Hey, where are you going?\n - Hey, Dorn, I hear your boss de Meister is back in town. Ought to have material for more stories soon. You\u0027re lucky you\u0027ve got someone to grind out your plots ready-made - Huh? Well, good-bye.\n - Why, Graham, darling, wherever were you last night? Ann\u0027s affair didn\u0027t get anywhere without you; or at least, it wouldn\u0027t have, if it hadn\u0027t been for Reggie de Meister. He asked after you; but then, I guess he felt lost without his Wat son. It must feel wonderful to Watson for such- Mister Dorn! And the same to you, sir!\n - You put one over on me. I thought you made up those wild things. Well, truth is stranger than fiction, ha, ha!\n Police officials deny that the famous amateur criminologist Reginald tie Meister has interested himself in this case. Mr. de Meister himself could not be reached by our reporters for comment. Mr. de Meister is best known to the public for his brilliant solutions to over a dozen crimes, as chronicled in fiction form by his so-called \u0027Watson,\u0027 Mr. Grayle Doone.\n Graham quivered and his arms trembled in an awful desire for blood. De Meister was haunting him - but good. He was losing his individuality, exactly as had been threatened.\n It gradually dawned upon Graham that the monotonous ringing noise he heard was not in his head, but, on the contrary, from the front door.\n Such seemed likewise the opinion of Miss June Billings, whose piercing call shot down the stairs and biffed Graham a sharp uppercut to the ear-drums.\n \u0027Hey, dope, see who\u0027s at the front door, before the vibration tears the house down. I\u0027ll be down in half an hour.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, dear!\u0027\n Graham shuffled his way to the front door and opened it. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-early-asimov-volume-3/page-4.html","bookId":1748,"book":{"id":1748,"title":"The Early Asimov Volume 3","description":"Storyline: \n The Early Asimov Volume 3 (Panther Science Fiction) \n The Early Asimov or, Eleven Years of Trying is a 1972 collection of short stories by Isaac Asimov.
