{"id":70951,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"The secretary shrugged amiably. \u0027One has a certain natural skepticism. What are your future plans?\u0027\n \u0027Why do you ask?\u0027 The Board Master grunted his words as if they were being squeezed out singly.\n To see if they jibe with my own.\u0027\n \u0027And what are your own?\"\n \u0027The secretary smiled. \u0027No, no. You take precedence. How long do you intend staying here?\u0027\n \u0027As long as it takes to make a fair beginning on the documents involved.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s no answer. What do you mean by a fair beginning?\u0027\n \u0027I haven\u0027t the slightest idea. It might take years.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, damnation.\u0027\n The Board Master raised his eyebrows and said nothing.\n The secretary looked at his nails. \u0027I take it you know the location of this robot world.\u0027\n \u0027Naturally. Theor Realo was there. His information up to now has proven very accurate.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s right. The albino. Well, why not go there?\u0027\n \u0027Go there! Impossible!\u0027\n \u0027May I ask why?\u0027\n \u0027Look,\u0027 said the Board Master with restrained impatience, \u0027you\u0027re not here by our invitation, and we\u0027re not asking you to dictate our course of actions, but just to show you that I\u0027m not looking for a fight, I\u0027ll give you a little metaphorical treatment of our case. Suppose we were presented with a huge and complicated machine, composed of principles and materials of which we knew next to nothing. It is so vast we can\u0027t even make out the relationship of the parts, let alone the purpose of the whole. Now, would you advise me to begin attacking the delicate mysterious moving parts of the machine with a detonating ray before I know what it\u0027s all about?\u0027\n \u0027I see your point, of course, but you\u0027re becoming a mystic. The metaphor is farfetched.\u0027\n \u0027Not at all. These positronic robots were constructed along lines we know nothing of as yet and were intended to follow lines with which we are entirely unacquainted. About the only thing we know is that the robots were put aside in complete isolation, to work out their destiny by themselves. To ruin that isolation would be to ruin the experiment. If we go there in a body, introducing new, unforeseen factors, inducing unintended reactions, everything is ruined. The littlest disturbance -\u0027\n \u0027Poppycock! Theor Realo has already gone there.\u0027\n The Board Master lost his temper suddenly. \u0027Don\u0027t you suppose I know that? Do you suppose it would ever have happened if that cursed albino hadn\u0027t been an ignorant fanatic without any knowledge of psychology at all? Galaxy knows what the idiot has done in the way of damage.\u0027\n There was a silence. The secretary clicked his teeth with a\n thoughtful fingernail. \u0027I don\u0027t know... I don\u0027t know. But I\u0027ve\n got to find out. And I can\u0027t wait years.\u0027\n He left, and the Board Master turned seethingly to Brand, \u0027And how are we going to stop him from going to the robot world if\u0027he wants to?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t see how he can go if we don\u0027t let him. He doesn\u0027t head the expedition.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, doesn\u0027t he? That\u0027s what I was about to tell you just before he came in. Ten ships of the fleet have landed on Dorlis since we arrived.\u0027\n \u0027What!\u0027\n \u0027Just that.\u0027\n \u0027But what for?\u0027\n \u0027That, my boy, is what I don\u0027t understand, either.\u0027\n \u0027Mind if I drop in?\u0027 said Wynne Murry, pleasantly, and Theor Realo looked up in sudden anxiety from the papers that lay in hopeless disarray on the desk before him.\n \u0027Come in. I\u0027ll clear off a seat for you.\u0027 The albino hustled the mess off one of the two chairs in a state of twittering nerves.\n Murry sat down and swung one long leg over the other. \u0027Are you assigned a job here, too?\u0027 He nodded at the desk.\n Theor shook his head and smiled feebly. Almost automatically, he brushed the papers together in a heap and turned them face down.\n In the months since he had returned to Dorlis with a hundred psychologists of various degrees of renown, he had felt himself pushed farther and farther from the center of things. There was room for him no longer. Except to answer questions on the actual state of things upon the robot world, which he alone had visited, he played no part. And even there he detected, or seemed to detect, anger that he should have gone, and not a competent scientist.\n It was a thing to be resented. Yet, somehow, it had always been like that.\n \u0027Pardon me?\u0027 He had let Murry\u0027s next remark slip.\n The secretary repeated, \u0027I say it\u0027s surprising you\u0027re not put to work, then. You made the original discovery, didn\u0027t you?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 the albino brightened. \u0027But it went out of my hands. It got beyond me.\u0027\n \u0027You were on the robot world, though.\u0027\n That was a mistake, they tell me. I might have ruined everything.\u0027\n Murry grimaced. \u0027What really gets them, I guess, is that you\u0027ve got a lot of first-hand dope that they didn\u0027t. Don\u0027t let their fancy titles fool you into thinking you\u0027re a nobody. A layman with common sense is better than a blind specialist. You and I - I\u0027m a layman, too, you know - have to stand up for our rights. Here, have a cigarette.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t sm- I\u0027ll take one, thank you.\u0027 The albino felt himself warming to the long-bodied man opposite. He turned the papers face upward again, and lit up, bravely but uncertainly.\n \u0027Twenty-five years.\u0027 Theor spoke carefully, skirting around urgent coughs.\n \u0027Would you answer a few questions about the world?\u0027\n \u0027I suppose so. That\u0027s all they ever ask me about. But hadn\u0027t you better ask them? They\u0027ve probably got it all worked out now.\u0027 He blew the smoke as far from himself as possible.\n Hurry said, \u0027Frankly, they haven\u0027t even begun, and I want the information without benefit of confusing psychological translation. First of all. what kind of people - or things - are these robots? You haven\u0027t a photocast of one of them, have you?\u0027\n \u0027Well, no. I didn\u0027t like to take \u0027casts of them. But they\u0027re not things. They\u0027re people!\u0027\n \u0027No? Do they look like - people?\u0027\n \u0027Yes - mostly. Outside, anyway. I brought some microscopic studies of the cellular structure that I got hold of. The Board Master has them. They\u0027re different inside, you know, greatly simplified. But you\u0027d never know that. They\u0027re interesting -and nice.\u0027\n \u0027Are they simpler than the other life of the planet?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, no. It\u0027s a very primitive planet. And... and,\u0027 he was interrupted by a spasm of coughing and crushed the cigarette to death as unobtrusively as possible. \u0027They\u0027ve got a protoplasmic base, you know. I don\u0027t think they have the slightest idea they\u0027re robots.\u0027\n \u0027No. I don\u0027t suppose they would have. What about their science?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. I never got a chance to see. And everything was so different. I guess it would take an expert to understand.\u0027\n \u0027Did they have machines?\u0027\n The albino looked surprised. \u0027Well, of course. A good many, of all sorts.\u0027\n \u0027Large cities?\u0027\n \u0027Yes!\u0027\n The secretary\u0027s eyes grew thoughtful. \u0027And you like them. Why?\u0027\n Theor Realo was brought up sharply. \u0027I don\u0027t know. They were just likable. We got along. They didn\u0027t bother me so. It\u0027s nothing I can put my finger on. Maybe it\u0027s because I have it so hard getting along back home, and they weren\u0027t as difficult as real people.\u0027\n \u0027They were more friendly?\u0027\n \u0027N-no. Can\u0027t say so. They never quite accepted me. I was a stranger, didn\u0027t know their language at first - all that. But\u0027 - he looked up with sudden brightness - \u0027I understood them better. I could tell what they were thinking better. I- But I don\u0027t know why.\u0027\n \u0027Hm-m-m. Well - another cigarette? No? I\u0027ve got to be walloping the pillow now. It\u0027s getting late. How about a twosome at golf tomorrow? I\u0027ve worked up a little course. It\u0027ll do. Come on out. The exercise will put hair on your chest.\u0027\n He grinned and left.\n He mumbled one sentence to himself: \u0027It looks like a death sentence\u0027 - and whistled thoughtfully as he passed along to his own quarters.\n He repeated the phrase to himself when he faced the Board Master the next day, with the sash of office about his waist. He did not sit down.\n \u0027Again?\u0027 said the Board Master, wearily.\n \u0027Again!\u0027 assented the secretary. \u0027But real business this time. I may have to take over direction of your expedition.\u0027\n \u0027What! Impossible, sir! I will listen to no such proposition.\u0027\n \u0027I have my authority.\u0027 Wynne Murry presented the metalloid cylinder that snapped open at a flick of the thumb. \u0027I have full powers and full discretion as to their use. It is signed, as you will observe, by the chairman of the Congress of the Federation.\u0027\n \u0027So- But why?\u0027 The Board Master, by an effort, breathed normally. \u0027Short of arbitrary tyranny, is there a reason?\u0027\n \u0027A very good one, sir. All along, we have viewed this expedition from different angles. The Department of Science and Technology views the robot world not from the point of view of a scientific curiosity, but from the standpoint of its interference with the peace of the Federation. I don\u0027t think you\u0027ve ever stopped to consider the danger inherent in this robot world.\u0027\n \u0027None that I can see. It is thoroughly isolated and thoroughly harmless.\u0027\n \u0027How can you know?\u0027\n \u0027From the very nature of the experiment,\u0027 shouted the Board Master angrily. \u0027The original planners wanted as nearly a completely closed system as possible. Here they are, just as far off the trade routes as possible, in a thinly populated region of space. The whole idea was to have the robots develop free of interference.\u0027\n Murry smiled. \u0027I disagree with you there. Look, the whole trouble with you is that you\u0027re a theoretical man. You look at things the way they ought to be and I, a practical man, look at things as they are. No experiment can be set up and allowed to run indefinitely under its own power. It is taken for granted that somewhere there is at least an observer who watches and modifies as circumstances warrant.\u0027\n \u0027Well?\u0027 said the Board Master stolidly.\n \u0027Well, the observers in this experiment, the original psychologists of Dorlis, passed away with the First Confederation, and for fifteen thousand years the experiment has proceeded by itself. Little errors have added up and become big ones and introduced alien factors which induced still other errors. It\u0027s a geometric progression. And there\u0027s been no one to halt it.\u0027\n \u0027Pure hypothesis.\u0027\n \u0027Maybe. But you\u0027re interested only in the robot world, and I\u0027ve got to think of the entire Federation.\u0027\n \u0027And just what possible danger can the robot world be to the Federation? I don\u0027t know what in Arcturus you\u0027re driving at, man.\u0027\n Murry sighed. \u0027I\u0027ll be simple, but don\u0027t blame me if I sound melodramatic. The Federation hasn\u0027t had any internal warfare for centuries. What will happen if we come into contact with these robots?\u0027\n \u0027Are you afraid of one world?\u0027\n \u0027Could be. What about their science? Robots can do funny things sometimes.\u0027\n \u0027What science can they have? They\u0027re not metal-electricity supermen. They\u0027re weak protoplasmic creatures, a poor imitation of actual humanity, built around a positronic brain adjusted to a set of simplified human psychological laws. If the word \"robot\" is scaring you -\u0027\n \u0027No, it isn\u0027t, but I\u0027ve talked to Theor Realo. He\u0027s the only one who\u0027s seen them, you know.\u0027\n The Board Master cursed silently and fluently. It came of letting a weak-minded freak of a layman get underfoot where he could babble and do harm.\n He said, \u0027We\u0027ve got Realo\u0027s full story, and we\u0027ve evaluated it fully and capably. I assure you, no harm exists in them. The experiment is so thoroughly academic, I wouldn\u0027t spend two days on it if it weren\u0027t for the broad scope of the thing. From what we see, the whole idea was to build up a positronic brain containing modifications of one or two of the fundamental axioms. We haven\u0027t worked out the details, but they must be minor, as it was the first experiment of this nature ever tried, and even the great mythical psychologists of that day had to progress stepwise. Those robots, I tell you, are neither supermen nor beasts. I assure you - as a psychologist.\u0027\n \u0027Sorry! I\u0027m a psychologist, too. A little more rule-of-thumb, I\u0027m afraid. That\u0027s all. But even little modifications! Take the general spirit of combativeness. That isn\u0027t the scientific term, but I\u0027ve no patience for that. You know what I mean. We humans used to be combative. But it\u0027s being bred out of us. A stable political and economic system doesn\u0027t encourage the waste energy of combat. It\u0027s not a survival factor. But suppose the robots are combative. Suppose as the result of a wrong turn during the millennia they\u0027ve been unwatched, they\u0027ve become far more combative than ever their first makers intended. They\u0027d be uncomfortable things to be with.\u0027\n \u0027And suppose all the stars in the Galaxy became novae at the same time. Let\u0027s really start worry ing.\u0027\n \u0027And there\u0027s another point.\u0027 Murry ignored the other\u0027s heavy sarcasm. \u0027Theor Realo liked those robots. He liked robots better than he likes real people. He felt that he fitted there, and we all know he\u0027s been a bad misfit in his own world.\u0027\n \u0027And what,\u0027 asked the Board Master, \u0027is the significance of that?\u0027\n \u0027You don\u0027t see it?\u0027 Wynne Murry lifted his eyebrows. \u0027Theor Realo likes those robots because he is like them, obviously. I\u0027ll guarantee right now that a complete psychic analysis of Theor Realo will show a modification of several fundamental axioms, and the same ones as in the robots.\n \u0027And,\u0027 the secretary drove on without a pause, \u0027Theor Realo worked for a quarter of a century to prove a point, when all science would have laughed him to death if they had known about it. There\u0027s fanaticism there; good, honest, inhuman perseverance. Those robots are probably like that!\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re advancing no logic. You\u0027re arguing like a maniac, like a moon-struck idiot.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t need strict mathematical proof. Reasonable doubt is sufficient. I\u0027ve got to protect the Federation. Look, it is reasonable, you know. The psychologists of Dorlis weren\u0027t as super as all that. They had to advance stepwise, as you yourself pointed out. Their humanoids - let\u0027s not call them robots -were only imitations of human beings and they could be good ones. Humans possess certain very, very complicated reaction systems - things like social consciousness, and a tendency toward the establishment of ethical systems; and more ordinary things like chivalry, generosity, fair play and so on, that simply can\u0027t possibly be duplicated. I don\u0027t think those humanoids can have them. But they must have perseverance, which practically implies stubbornness and combativeness, if my notion on Theor Realo holds good. Well, if their science is anywhere at all, then I don\u0027t want to have them running loose in the Galaxy, if our numbers are a thousand or million times theirs. And I don\u0027t intend to permit them to do so!\u0027\n The Board Master\u0027s face was rigid. \u0027What are your immediate intentions?\u0027\n \u0027As yet undecided. But I think I am going to organize a small-scale landing on the planet.\u0027\n \u0027Now, wait.\u0027 The old psychologist was up and around the desk. He seized the secretary\u0027s elbow. \u0027Are you quite certain you know what you\u0027re doing? The potentialities in this massive experiment are beyond any possible precalculation by you or me. You can\u0027t know what you\u0027re destroying.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-early-asimov-volume-3/page-8.html","bookId":1748,"book":{"id":1748,"title":"The Early Asimov Volume 3","description":"Storyline: \n The Early Asimov Volume 3 (Panther Science Fiction) \n The Early Asimov or, Eleven Years of Trying is a 1972 collection of short stories by Isaac Asimov.
