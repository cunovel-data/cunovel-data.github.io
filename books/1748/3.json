{"id":70946,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"De Meister said menacingly, \u0027It would be better for you if the de Meister mysteries continue. Do you understand?\u0027\\n\\n Graham recovered and summoned a feeble indignation. \u0027Now, wait a while. You\u0027re getting out of hand. Remember: in a way, I\u0027m your father. That\u0027s right. Your mental father. You can\u0027t hand me ultimatums or make threats. It isn\u0027t filial. It\u0027s lacking in the proper respect and love.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And another thing.\u0027 said de Meister, unmoved. \u0027We\u0027ve got to straighten out this business of Letitia Reynolds. It\u0027s gettin\u0027 deucedly borin\u0027, y\u0027know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Now you\u0027re getting silly. My love scenes have been widely heralded as miracles of tenderness and sentiment not found in one murder mystery out of a thousand. - Wait, I\u0027ll get you a few reviews. I don\u0027t mind your attempts to dictate my actions so much, but I\u0027m damned if you\u0027ll criticize my writing.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Forget the reviews. Tenderness and all that rot is what I don\u0027t want. I\u0027ve been driftin\u0027 after the fair lady for five volumes now, and behavin\u0027 the most insufferable ass. This has got to stop.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In what way?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve got to marry her in your present story. Either that, or make her a good, respectable mistress. And you\u0027ll have to stop making me so damned Victorian and gentlemanly towards ladies. I\u0027m only human, old man.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Impossible!\u0027 said Graham, \u0027and that includes your last remark.\u0027\\n\\n De Meister grew severe. \u0027Really, old chap, for an author, you display the most appallio\u0027 lack of concern for the well-bein\u0027 of a character who has supported you for a good many years.\u0027\\n\\n Graham choked eloquently. \u0027Supported me? In other words, you think I couldn\u0027t sell real novels, hey? Well, I\u0027ll show you. I wouldn\u0027t write another de Meister story for a million dollars. Not even for a fifty percent royalty and all television rights. How\u0027s that?\u0027\\n\\n De Meister frowned and uttered those words that had been the sound of doom to so many criminals: \u0027We shall see, but yon are not yet done with me.\u0027\\n\\n With firmly jutting jaw, he vanished.\\n\\n Graham\u0027s twisted face straightened out, and slowly - very slowly - he brought his hands up to his cranium and felt carefully.\\n\\n For the first time in a long and reasonably ribald mental life, he felt that his enemies were right and that a good dry cleaning would not hurt his mind at all.\\n\\n The things that existed in it!\\n\\n Graham Dorn shoved the doorbell with his elbow a second time. He distinctly remembered her saying she would be home at eight.\\n\\n The peep-hole shoved open. \u0027Hello!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hello!\u0027\\n\\n Silence!\\n\\n Graham said plaintively, \u0027It\u0027s raining outside. Can\u0027t I come in to dry?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. Are we engaged, Mr. Dorn?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If I\u0027m not,\u0027 was the stiff reply, \u0027then I\u0027ve been turning down the frenzied advances of a hundred passion-stricken girls -beautiful ones, all of them - for no apparent reason.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yesterday, you said -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ah, but who listens to what I say? I\u0027m just quaint that way. Look, I brought you posies.\u0027 He flourished roses before the peep-hole.\\n\\n June opened the door. \u0027Roses! How plebeian. Come in, cookie, and sully the sofa. Whoa, whoa, before you move a step, what have you got under the other arm? Not the manuscript of Death on the Third Deck?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Correct. Not that excrescence of a manuscript. This is something different.\u0027\\n\\n June\u0027s tone chilled. \u0027That isn\u0027t your precious novel, is it?\u0027\\n\\n Graham flung his head up, \u0027How did you know about it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You slobbered the plot all over me at MacDunlap\u0027s silver anniversary party.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I did not. I couldn\u0027t unless I were drunk.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, but you were. Stinking is the term. And on two cocktails too.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, if I was drunk, I couldn\u0027t have told you the right plot.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is the setting a coal-mine district?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027-Uh-yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And are the people concerned real, earthy, unartificial, down-to-earth characters, speaking and thinking just like you and me? Is it a story of basic economic forces? Are the human characters lifted up and thrown down and whirled around, all at the mercy of the coal mine and mechanized industry of today?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027-Uh-yes.\u0027\\n\\n She nodded her head retrospectively. \u0027I remember distinctly. First, you got drunk and were sick. Then you got better, and told me the first few chapters. Then I got sick.\u0027\\n\\n She approached the glowering author. \u0027Graham.\u0027 She leant her golden head upon his shoulder and cooed softly. \u0027Why don\u0027t you continue with the de Meister stories? You get such pretty checks out of them.\u0027\\n\\n Graham writhed out of her grasp. \u0027You are a mercenary wretch, incapable of understanding an author\u0027s soul. You may consider our engagement broken.\u0027\\n\\n He sat down hard on the sofa, and folded his arms. \u0027Unless you will consent to read the script of my novel and give me the usual story analysis.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027May I give you my analysis of Death on the Third Deck first?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good! In the first place, your love interest is becoming sickening.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It is not.\u0027 Graham pointed his finger indignantly. \u0027It breathes a sweet and sentimental fragrance, as of an older day. I\u0027ve got the review here that says it.\u0027 He fumbled in his wallet.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, bullfeathers. Are you going to start quoting that guy in the Pillsboro (Okla.) Clarion? He\u0027s probably your second cousin. You know that your last two novels were completely below par in royalties. And Third Deck isn\u0027t even being sold.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So much the better - Ow!\u0027 He rubbed his head violently. \u0027What did you do that for?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because the only place I could hit as hard as I wanted to, without disabling you, was your head. Listen! The public is tired of your corny Letitia Reynolds. Why don\u0027t you let her soak her \"gleaming golden crown of hair\" in kerosene and get familiar with a match?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But June, that character is drawn from life. From you!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Graham Dorn! I am not here to listen to insults. The mystery market today is swinging toward action and hot, honest love and you\u0027re still in the sweet, sentimental stickiness of five years ago.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But that\u0027s Reginald de Meister\u0027s character.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, change his character. Listen! You introduce Sancha Rodriguez. That\u0027s fine. I approve of her. She\u0027s Mexican, flaming, passionate, sultry and in love with him. So what do you do? First he behaves the impeccable gentleman, and then you kill her off in the middle of the story.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hmm, I see - You really think it would improve things to have de Meister forget himself. A kiss or so -\u0027\\n\\n June clenched her lovely teeth and her lovely fists. \u0027Oh, darling, how glad I am love is blind! If it ever peeked one tiny little bit, I couldn\u0027t stand it. Look, you squirrel\u0027s blue plate special, you\u0027re going to have de Meister and Rodriguez fall in love. They\u0027re going to have an affair through the entire book and you can put your horrible Letitia into a nunnery. She would probably be happier there from the way you make her sound.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s all you know about it, my sweet. It so happens that Reginald de Meister is in love wifh Letitia Reynolds and wants her, not this Rodriguez person.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And what makes you think that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He told me so.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who told you so?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Reginald de Meister.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What Reginald de Meister?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My Reginald de Meister.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What do you mean, your Reginald de Meister?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My character, Reginald de Meister.\u0027\\n\\n June got up, indulged in some deep-breathing and then said in a very calm voice, \u0027Let\u0027s start all over.\u0027\\n\\n She disappeared for a moment and returned with an aspirin. \u0027Your Reginald de Meister, from your books, told you, in person, he was in love with Letitia Reynolds?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s right.\u0027\\n\\n June swallowed the aspirin.\\n\\n \u0027Well, I\u0027ll explain, June, the way he explained it to me. All characters really exist - at least, in the minds of the authors. But when people really begin to believe in them, they begin to exist in reality, because what people believe in, is, so far as they\u0027re concerned, and what is existence anyway?\u0027\\n\\n June\u0027s lips trembled. \u0027Oh, Gramie, please don\u0027t. Mother will never let me marry you if they put you in an asylum.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t call me Gramie, June, for God\u0027s sake. I tell you he was there, trying to tell me what to write and how to write it. He was almost as bad as you. Aw, come on, Baby, don\u0027t cry.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t help it. I always thought you were crazy, but I never thought you were crazy!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right, what\u0027s the difference? Let\u0027s not talk about it any more. I\u0027m never going to write another mystery novel. After all\u0027 - (he indulged in a bit of indignation) - \u0027when it gets so that my own character - my own character - tries to tell me what to do, it\u0027s going too far.\u0027\\n\\n June looked over her handkerchief. \u0027How do you know it was really de Meister?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, golly. As soon as he tapped his Turkish cigarette on the back of his hand and started dropping g\u0027s like snowflakes in a blizzard, I knew the worst had come.\u0027\\n\\n The telephone rang. June leaped up. \u0027Don\u0027t answer, Graham. It\u0027s probably from the asylum. I\u0027ll tell them you\u0027re not here. Hello. Hello. Oh, Mr. MacDunlap.\u0027 She heaved a sigh of relief, then covered the mouthpiece and whispered hoarsely, \u0027It might be a trap.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hello, Mr. MacDunlap!... No, he\u0027s not here...Yes, I\\n\\n think I can get in touch with him...At Martin\u0027s tomorrow,\\n\\n noon... I\u0027ll tell him... With who?... With who???\u0027 She hung up suddenly.\\n\\n \u0027Graham, you\u0027re to lunch with MacDunlap tomorrow,\u0027\\n\\n \u0027At his expense! Only at his expense! \u0027\\n\\n Her great blue eyes got greater and bluer, \u0027And Reginald de Meister is to dine with you.\"\\n\\n \u0027What Reginald de Meister?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Your Reginald de Meister.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My Reg-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, Gramie, don\u0027t.\u0027 Her eyes misted, \u0027Don\u0027t you see, Gramie, now they\u0027ll put us both in an insane asylum - and Mr. MacDunlap, too. And they\u0027ll probably put us all in the same padded cell. Oh, Gramie, three is such a dreadful crowd.\u0027\\n\\n And her face crumpled into tears.\\n\\n Grew S. MacDunlap (that the S. stands for \u0027Some\u0027 is a vile untruth spread by his enemies) was alone at the table when Graham Dorn entered. Out of this fact, Graham extracted a few fleeting drops of pleasure.\\n\\n It was not so much, you understand, the presence of MacDunlap that did it, as the absence of de Meister.\\n\\n MacDunlap looked at him over his spectacles and swallowed a liver pill, his favorite sweetmeat.\\n\\n \u0027Aha. You\u0027re here. What is this corny joke you\u0027re putting over on me? You had no right to mix me up with a person like de Meister without warning me he was real. I might have taken precautions. I could have hired a bodyguard. I could have bought a revolver.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s not real. God damn it! Half of him was your idea.\u0027\\n\\n That,\u0027 returned MacDunlap with heat, \u0027is libel. And what do you mean, he\u0027s not real? When he introduced himself, I took three liver pills at once and he didn\u0027t disappear. Do you know what three pills are? Three pills, the kind I\u0027ve got (the doctor should only drop dead), could make an elephant disappear - if he weren\u0027t real. I know.\u0027\\n\\n Graham said wearily, \u0027Just the same, he exists only in my mind.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In your mind, I know he exists. Your mind should be investigated by the Pure Food and Drugs Act.\u0027\\n\\n The several polite rejoinders that occurred simultaneously to Graham were dismissed almost immediately as containing too great a proportion of pithy Anglo-Saxon expletives. After all -ha, ha - a publisher is a publisher however Anglo-Saxony he may be.\\n\\n Graham said, \u0027The question arises, then, how we\u0027re to get rid of de Meister.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Get rid of de Meister?\u0027 MacDunlap jerked the glasses off his nose in his sudden start, and caught them in one hand. His voice thickened with emotion. \u0027Who wants to get rid of him?\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-early-asimov-volume-3/page-3.html","bookId":1748,"book":{"id":1748,"title":"The Early Asimov Volume 3","description":"Storyline: The Early Asimov Volume 3 (Panther Science Fiction) \\n The Early Asimov or, Eleven Years of Trying is a 1972 collection of short stories by Isaac Asimov.
