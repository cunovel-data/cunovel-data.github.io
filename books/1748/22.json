Other tensions, however, did not pass him by.\n The gathering after the dinner naturally fell apart into little groups. Keilin joined the one that contained Franklin May-nard of Aurora. As the delegate of the largest of the Worlds, he was naturally the most newsworthy.\n Maynard was speaking casually between sips at the tawny Hesperian cocktail in his hand. If his flesh crawled slightly at the closeness of the others, he masked the feeling masterfully.\n \u0027Earth,\u0027 he said, \u0027is, in essence, helpless against us if we avoid unpredictable military adventures. Economic unity is actually a necessity, if we intend to avoid such adventures. Let Earth realize to how great an extent her economy depends upon us, on the things that we alone can supply her, and there will be no more talk of living space. And if we are united, Earth would never dare attack. She will exchange her barren longings for atomic motors - or not, as she pleases.\u0027\n And he turned to regard Keilin with a certain hauteur as the other found himself stung to comment:\n \u0027But your manufactured goods, councilor - I mean those you ship to Earth - they are not given us. They are exchanged for agricultural products.\u0027\n Maynard smiled silkily. \u0027Yes, I believe the delegate from Tethys has mentioned that fact at length. There is a delusion prevalent among some of us that only Terrestrial seeds grow properly -\u0027\n He was interrupted calmly by another, who said: \u0027Now, I am not from Tethys, but what you mention is not a delusion. I grow rye on Rhea, and I have never yet been able to duplicate Terrestrial bread. It just hasn\u0027t got the same taste.\u0027 He addressed the audience in general, \u0027In fact, I imported half a dozen Terrestrians five years back on agricultural laborer visas so they could oversee the robots. Now, they can do wonders with the land, you know. Where they spit, corn grows fifteen feet high. Well, that helped a little. And using Terrestrian seed helped. But even if you grow Terrestrian grain, its seed won\u0027t hold the next year.\u0027\n \u0027Has your soil been tested by your government\u0027s agricultural department?\u0027 asked Maynard.\n The Rhean grew haughty in his turn: \u0027No better soil in the sector. And the rye is top-grade. I even sent a hundredweight down to Earth for nutritional clearance, and it came back with full marks.\u0027 He rubbed one side of his chin, thoughtfully: \u0027It\u0027s flavor I\u0027m talking about. Doesn\u0027t seem to have the right -\u0027\n Maynard made an effort to dismiss him: \u0027Flavor is dispensable temporarily. They\u0027ll be coming to us on our terms, these little-men-hordes of Earth, when they feel the pinch. We give up only this mysterious flavor, but they will have to give up atom-powered engines, farm machinery, and ground cars. It wouldn\u0027t be a bad idea, in fact, to attempt to get along without the Terrestrian flavors you are so concerned about. Let us appreciate the flavor of our home-grown products instead -which could stand comparison if we gave it a chance.\u0027\n \u0027That so?\u0027 the Rhean smiled. \u0027I notice you\u0027re smoking Earth-grown tobacco.\u0027\n \u0027A habit I can break if I have to.\u0027\n \u0027Probably by giving up smoking. I wouldn\u0027t use Outer World tobacco for anything but killing mosquitoes.\u0027\n He laughed a trifle too boisterously, and left the group. Maynard stared after him, a little pinch-nosed.\n To Keilin, the little byplay over rye and tobacco brought a certain satisfaction. He regarded such personalities as the tiny reflection of certain Galactopolitical realities. Tethys and Rhea were the largest planets in the Galactic south, as Aurora was the largest in the Galactic north. All three planets were identically racist, identically exclusivist. Their views on Earth were similar and completely compatible. Ordinarily, one would think that there was no room to quarrel.\n But Aurora was the oldest of the Outer Worlds, the most advanced, the strongest militarily - and, therefore, aspired to a sort of moral leadership of all the Worlds. That was sufficient in itself to arouse opposition, and Rhea and Tethys served as focal points for those who did not recognize Auroran leadership.\n Keilin was somberly grateful for that situation. If Earth could but lean her weight properly, first in one direction, then in the other, an, ultimate spilt, or even fragmentation -\n He eyed Maynard cautiously, almost furtively, and wondered what effect this would have on the next day\u0027s debate. Already, the Auroran was more silent than was quite polite.\n And then some under-secretary or sub-official threaded his way through the clusters of guests in finicking fashion, and beckoned to Maynard.\n Keilin\u0027s following eyes watched the Auroran retreat with the newcomer, watched him listen closely, mouth a startled \u0027What!\u0027 that was quite visible to the eye, though too far off to be heard, and then reach for a paper that the other handed Mm.\n And as a result, the next day\u0027s session of the conference went entirely differently than Keilin would have predicted.\n Keilin discovered the details in the evening video-casts. The Terrestrian government, it seemed, had sent a note to all the governments attending the conference. It warned each one bluntly that any agreement among them in military or economic affairs would be considered an unfriendly act against Earth and that it would be met with appropriate counter-measures. The note denounced Aurora, Tethys and Rhea all equally. It accused them of being engaged in an imperialist conspiracy against Earth, and so on - and on - and on.\n Tools!\u0027 gritted Keilin, all but butting his head against the wall out of sheer chagrin. \u0027Fools! Fools! Fools!\u0027 And his voice died away still muttering that same, one word.\n The next session of the conference was well and early attended by a set of angry delegates who were only too eager to grind into nothingness the disagreements still outstanding. When it ended, all matters concerning trade between Earth and the Outer Worlds had been placed in the hands of a commission with plenary powers.\n Not even Aurora could have expected so complete and easy a victory, and Keilin, on his way back to Earth, longed for Ms voice to reach the video, so that it could be to others, and not to himself only, that he could shout his disgust.\n Yet, on Earth, some men smiled.\n Once back on Earth, the voice of Keilin slowly swirled under and down - lost in the noisier clamor that shouted for action.\n His popularity sank in proportion as trade restrictions grew. Slowly, the Outer Worlds drew the noose tighter. First, they instituted a strict application of a new system of export licensing. Secondly, they banned the export to Earth of all materials capable of being \u0027used in a war effort.\u0027 And finally they applied a very broad interpretation indeed of what could be considered usable in such a connection.\n Imported luxuries - and imported necessities, too, for that matter - vanished or priced themselves upwards out of the reach of all but the very few.\n So the people marched, and the voices shouted and the banners swung about in the sunlight, and the stones flew at the consulates -\n Keilin shouted hoarsely and felt as if he were going mad.\n Until, suddenly, Luiz Moreno, quite of his own accord, offered to appear on Keilin\u0027s program and submit to unrestricted questioning in his capacity as ex-Ambassador to Aurora and present Secretary without Portfolio.\n To Keilin it had had all the possibilities of a rebirth. He knew Moreno - no fool, he. With Moreno on his program, he was assured an audience as great as his greatest. With Moreno answering questions, certain misapprehensions might be removed, certain confusions might be straightened. The mere fact that Moreno wished to use his - his - program as sounding board might well mean that already a more pliant and sensible foreign policy might have been decided upon. Perhaps Maynard was correct, and the pinch was being felt and was working as predicted.\n The list of questions had, of course, been submitted to Moreno in advance, but the ex-Ambassador had indicated that he would answer all of them, and any follow-up questions that might seem necessary.\n It seemed quite ideal. Too ideal, perhaps, but only a criminal fool could worry over minutiae at this point.\n There was an adequate ballyhoo - and when they faced one another across the little table, the red needle that indicated the number of video sets drawing power on that channel hovered well over the two hundred million mark. And there was an average of 2.7 listeners per video set. Now the theme; the official introduction.\n Keilin rubbed his cheek slowly, as he waited for the signal.\n Then, he began:\n Q. Secretary Moreno, the question which interests all Earth at the moment, concerns the possibility of war. Suppose we start with that. Do you think there will be war?\n A. If Earth is the only planet to be considered, I say: No, definitely not. In its history, Earth has had too much war, and has learned many times over how little can be gained by it.\n Q. You say, \u0027If Earth is the only planet to be considered -\u0027 Do you imply that factors outside our control will bring war?\n A. I do not say \u0027will\u0027; but I could say \u0027may.\u0027 I cannot, of course speak for the Outer Worlds. I cannot pretend to know their motivations and intentions at this critical moment in Galactic history. They may choose war. I hope not. If so be that they do, however, we will defend ourselves. But in any case, we will never attack; we will not strike the first blow.\n Q. Am I right in saying, then, that in your opinion there are no basic differences between Earth and the Outer Worlds, which cannot be solved by negotiation?\n A. You certainly are. If the Outer Worlds were sincerely desirous of a solution, no disagreement between them and us could long exist.\n Q. Does that include the question of immigration?\n A. Definitely. Our own role in the matter is clear and beyond reproach. As matters stand, two hundred million human beings now occupy ninety-five percent of the available land in the universe. Six billions - that is, ninety-seven percent of all mankind - are squeezed into the other five percent. Such a situation is obviously unjust and, worse, unstable. Yet Earth, in the face of such injustice, has always been willing to treat this problem as soluble by degrees. It is still so willing. We should agree to reasonable quotas and reasonable restrictions. Yet the Outer Worlds have refused to discuss this matter. Over a space of five decades, they have rebuffed all efforts on the part of Earth to open negotiations.\n Q. If such an attitude on the part of the Outer Worlds continues, do you then think there will be war?\n A. I cannot believe that this attitude will continue. Our government will not cease hoping that the Outer Worlds will eventually reconsider their stand on the matter; that their sense of justice and right is not dead, but only sleeping.\n Q. Mr. Secretary, let us pass on to another subject. Do you think that the United Worlds Commission set up by the Outer Worlds recently to control trade with Earth represents a danger to peace?\n A. In the sense that its actions indicate a desire on the part of the Outer Worlds to isolate Earth, and to weaken it economically, I can say that it does.\n Q. To what actions do you refer, sir?\n A. To its actions in restricting interstellar trade with Earth to the point where, in credit values, the total stands now at least than ten percent of what it did three months ago.\n Q. But do such restrictions really represent an economic danger to Earth? For instance, it is not true that trade with the Outer Worlds represents an almost insignificant part of total Terrestrian trade? And is it not true that the importations from the Outer Worlds reach only a tiny minority of the population at best?\n A. Your questions now are representative of a profound fallacy which is very common among our isolationists. In credit values, it is true that interstellar trade represents only five percent of our total trade, but ninety-five percent of our atomic engines are imported. Eighty percent of our thorium, sixty-five percent of our cesium, sixty percent of our molybdenum and tin are imported. The list can be extended almost indefinitely, and it is quite easy to see that the five percent is an extremely important, a vital, five percent. Furthermore, if a large manufacturer receives a shipment of atomic steel-shapers from Rhea, it does not follow that the benefit redounds only to him. Every man on Earth who uses steel implements or objects manufactured by steel implements benefits.\n Q. But is it not true that the current restrictions on Earth\u0027s interstellar trade have cut our grain and cattle exports to almost nothing? And far from harming Earth, isn\u0027t this really a boon to our own hungry people?\n A, This is another serious fallacy. That Earth\u0027s good food supply is tragically inadequate is true. The government would be the last to deny it. But our food exports do not represent any serious drain upon this supply. Less than one fifth of one percent of Earth\u0027s food is exported, and in return we obtain, for instance, fertilizers and farm machinery which more than make up for that small loss by increasing agricultural efficiency. Therefore, by buying less food from us, the Outer Worlds are engaged, in effect, in cutting our already inadequate food supply.\n Q. Are you ready to admit, then, Secretary Moreno, that at least part of the blame for this situation should rest with Earth itself? In other words, we come to my next question: Was it not a diplomatic blunder of the first magnitude for the government to issue its inflammatory note denouncing the intentions of the Outer Worlds before those intentions had been made clear at the Interplanetary Conference?\n A. I think those intentions were quite clear at the time.\n Q. I beg pardon, sir, but I was at the conference. At the time the note was issued, there was almost a stalemate among the Outer World delegates. Those of Rhea and Tethys strongly opposed economic action against Earth, and there was considerable chance that Aurora and its block might have been defeated. Earth\u0027s note ended that possibility instantly.\n A. Well, what is your question, Mr. Keilin?\n Q. In view of my statements, do you or do you not think Earth\u0027s note to have been a criminal error of diplomacy which can now be made up only by a policy of intelligent conciliation?\n A. You use strong language. However, I cannot answer the question directly, since I do not agree with your major premise. I cannot believe that the delegates of the Outer Worlds could behave in the manner you describe. In the first place, it is well known that the Outer Worlds are proud of their boast that the percentage of insanity, psychoses and even relatively minor maladjustments of personality are almost at the vanishing point in their society. It is one of their strongest arguments against Earth, that we have more psychiatrists than plumbers and yet are more pinched for want of the former. The delegates to the conference represented the best of this so-stable society. And now you would have me believe that these demigods would, in a moment of pique, have reversed their opinions and instituted a major change in the economic policy of fifty worlds. I cannot believe them capable of such childish and perverse activity, and must therefore insist that any action they took was based not upon any note from Earth, but upon motivations that go deeper.\n Q. But I saw the effect upon them with my own eyes, sir. Remember, they were being scolded in what they considered to be insolent language from an inferior people. There can be no doubt, sir, that as a whole, the men of the Outer Worlds are a remarkably stable people, despite your sarcasm, but their attitude toward Earth represents a weak point in this stability.\n A. Are you asking me questions, or are you defending the racist views and policies of the Outer Worlds?\n Q. Well, accepting your viewpoint that Earth\u0027s note did no harm, what good could it have done? Why should it have been sent?\n A. I think we were justified in presenting our side of the question before the bar of Galactic public opinion. I believe we have exhausted the subject. What is your next question, please? It is the last, isn\u0027t it?\n Q. It is. It has recently been reported that the Terrestrian government will take stern measures against those dealing in smuggling operations. Is this consistent with the government\u0027s view that lowered trade relations are detrimental to Earth\u0027s welfare?\n A. Our primary concern is peace, and not our own immediate welfare. The Outer Worlds have adopted certain trade restrictions. We disapprove of them, and consider them a great injustice. Nevertheless, we shall adhere to them, so that no planet may say that we have given the slightest pretext for hostilities. For instance, I am privileged to announce here for the first time that in the past month, five ships, traveling under false Earth registry, were stopped while being engaged in the smuggling of Outer World materiel into Earth. Their goods were confiscated and their personnel imprisoned. This is an earnest of our good intentions.\n Q. Outer World ships?\n A. Yes. But traveling under false Earth registry, remember.\n Q. And the men imprisoned are citizens of the Outer Worlds?\n A. I believe so. However, they were breaking not only our laws, but those of the Outer Worlds as well, and therefore doubly forfeited their interplanetary rights. I think the interview had better close, now.\n Q. But this -\n It was at this point that the broadcast came to a sudden end. The conclusion of Keilin\u0027s last sentence was never heard by anyone but Moreno. It ended like this:\n \u0027- means war.\u0027\n But Luiz Moreno was no longer on the air. So as he drew on his gloves, he smiled and, with infinite meaning, shrugged his shoulders in a little gesture of indifference.\n There were no witnesses to that shrug.\n The Gathering at Aurora was still in session. Franklin May-nard had dropped out for the moment in utter weariness. He faced his son, whom he now saw for the first time in naval uniform.\n \u0027At least you\u0027re sure of what will happen, aren\u0027t you?\u0027\n In the young man\u0027s response, there was no weariness at all, no apprehension; nothing but utter satisfaction. \u0027This is it, dad!\u0027\n \u0027Nothing bothers you, then? You don\u0027t think we\u0027ve been maneuvered into this.\u0027\n \u0027Who cares if we have? It\u0027s Earth\u0027s funeral.\u0027\n Maynard shook his head: \u0027But you realize that we\u0027ve been put in the wrong. The Outer World citizens they hold are lawbreakers. Earth is within its rights.\u0027\n His son frowned: \u0027I hope you\u0027re not going to make statements like that to the Gathering, dad. I don\u0027t see that Earth is justified at all. All right, what if smuggling was going on? It was just because some Outer Worlders are willing to pay black market prices for Terrestrial food. If Earth had any sense, she could look the other way, and everyone would benefit. She makes enough noise about how she needs our trade, so why doesn\u0027t she do something about it? Anyway, I don\u0027t see that we ought to leave any good Aurorans or other Outer Worlders in the hands of those apemen. Since they won\u0027t give them up, we\u0027ll make them. Otherwise, none of us will be safe next time.\u0027\n \u0027I see that you\u0027ve adopted the popular opinions, anyway.\u0027\n \u0027The opinions are my own. If they\u0027re popular opinion also, it\u0027s because they make sense. Earth wants a war. Well, they\u0027ll get it.\u0027\n \u0027But why do they want a war, eh? Why do they force our hands? Our entire economic policy of the past months was only intended to force a change in their attitude without war.\u0027\n He was talking to himself, but his son answered with the final argument: \u0027I don\u0027t care why they wanted war. They\u0027ve got it now, and we\u0027re going to smash them.\u0027\n Maynard returned to the Gathering, but even as the drone of debate re-filled the room, he thought, with a twinge, that there would be no Terrestrian alfalfa that year. He regretted the milk. In fact, even the beef seemed, somehow, to be just a little less savory -\n The vote came in the early hours of the morning. Aurora declared war. Most of the worlds of the Aurora bloc joined it by dawn.\n In the history books, the war was later known as the Three Weeks\u0027 War. In the first week, Auroran forces occupied several of the trans-Plutonian asteroids, and at the beginning of the third week, the bulk of Earth\u0027s home fleet was all but completely destroyed in a battle within the orbit of Saturn by an Aurora fleet not one-quarter its size, numerically.\n Declarations of war from the Outer Worlds yet neutral followed like the pop-pop of a string of firecrackers.\n On the twenty-first day of the war, lacking two hours, Earth surrendered.\n The negotiations of peace terms took place among the Outer Worlds. Earth\u0027s activities were concerned with signing only. The conditions of peace were unusual, perhaps unique, and under the force of an unprecedented humiliation, all the hordes of Earth seemed suddenly struck with a silence that came from a shamed anger too strong for words.\n The terms mentioned were perhaps best commented upon by a voice on the Auroran video two days after they were made public. It can be quoted in part:\n \u0027... There is nothing in or on Earth that we of the Outer Worlds can need or want. All that was ever worthwhile on Earth left it centuries ago in the persons of our ancestors.\n \u0027They call us the children of Mother Earth, but that is not so, for we are the descendants of a Mother Earth that no longer exists, a Mother that we brought with us. The Earth of today bears us at best a cousinly relation. No more.\n \u0027Do we want their resources? Why, they have none for themselves. Can we use their industry or science? They are almost dead for lack of ours. Can we use their man power? Ten of them are not worth a single robot. Do we even want the dubious glory of ruling them? There is no such glory. As our helpless and incompetent inferiors, they would be only a drag upon us. They would divert from our own use food, labor and administrative ability.\n \u0027So they have nothing to give us but the space they occupy in our thought. They have nothing to free us from but themselves. They cannot benefit us in any way other than in their absence. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-early-asimov-volume-3/page-22.html","bookId":1748,"book":{"id":1748,"title":"The Early Asimov Volume 3","description":"Storyline: \n The Early Asimov Volume 3 (Panther Science Fiction) \n The Early Asimov or, Eleven Years of Trying is a 1972 collection of short stories by Isaac Asimov.
