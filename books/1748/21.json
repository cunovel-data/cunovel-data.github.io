{"id":70964,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"Keilin smiled very gently when he found the door blocked by two large men: \u0027You mean, I arn under arrest right now.\u0027 \u0027Exactly,\u0027 said Cellioni. \u0027On what charge?\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ll think ot some later.\u0027 Kelin left - under escort\n On Aurora, the mirror image of the afore-described events was taking place, and on a larger scale.\n The Foreign Agents Committee of the Gathering had been meeting now for days - ever since the session of the Gathering in which Ion Moreanu and his Conservative Party made their great bid to force a vote of no confidence. That it had failed was in part due to the superior political generalship of the Independents, and in some part due to the activity of this same Foreign Agents Committee.\n For months now, the evidence had been accumulating, and when the vote of confidence turned out to be sizably in favor of the Independents, the Committee was able to strike in its own way.\n Moreanu was subpoenaed in his own home, and placed under house arrest. Although this procedure of house arrest was not, under the circumstances, legal - a fact emphatically pointed out by Moreanu - it was nevertheless successfully accomplished.\n For three days Moreanu was cross-examined thoroughly, in polite, even tones that scarcely ever veered from unemotional curiosity. The seven inquisitors of the Committee took turns in questioning, but Moreanu had respite only for ten-minute intervals during the hours in which the Committee sat.\n After three days, he showed the effects. He was hoarse with demanding that he be faced with his accusers; weary with insisting that he be informed of the exact nature of the charges; throat-broken with shouting against the illegality of the procedure.\n The Committee finally read statements at him -\n \u0027Is this true or not? Is this true or not?\u0027\n Moreanu could merely shake his head wearily as the structure spidered about him.\n He challenged the competency of the evidence and was smoothly informed that the proceedings constituted a Committee Investigation and not a trial -\n The chairman clapped his gavel, finally. He was a broad man of tremendous purpose. He spoke for an hour in his final summing up of the results of the inquiry, but only a relatively short portion of it need be quoted.\n He said: \u0027If you had merely conspired with others on Aurora, we could understand you, even forgive you. Such a fault would have been held in common with many ambitious men in history. It is not that at all. What horrifies us and removes all pity is your eagerness to consort with the disease-ridden, ignorant and subhuman remnants of Earth.\n \u0027You, the accused, stand here under a heavy weight of evidence showing you to have conspired with the worst elements of Earth\u0027s mongrel population -\u0027\n The chairman was interrupted by an agonized cry from Moreanu, \u0027But the motive! What motive can you possibly attribute -\u0027\n The accused was pulled back into his seat. The chairman pursed his lips and departed from the slow gravity of his prepared speech to improvise a bit.\n \u0027It is not,\u0027 he said, \u0027for this Committee to go into your motives. We have shown the facts of the case. The Committee does have evidence -\u0027 He paused, and looked along the line of the members to the right and the left, then continued. \u0027I think I may say that the Committee has evidence that points to your intentions to use Earth manpower to engineer a coup that would leave you dictator over Aurora. But since the evidence has not been used, I will go no further into that, except to say that such a consummation is not inconsistent with your character as displayed at these hearings.\u0027\n He went back to his speech. Those of us who sit here have heard, I think, of something termed the \"Pacific Project,\" which, according to rumors, represents an attempt on the part of Earth to retrieve its lost dominions.\n \u0027It is needless to emphasize here that any such attempt must be doomed to failure. And yet defeat for us is not entirely inconceivable. One thing can cause us to stumble, and that one thing is an unsuspected internal weakness. Genetics is, after all, still an imperfect science. Even with twenty generations behind us, undesirable traits may crop up at scattered points, and each represents a flaw in the steel shield of Aurora \u0027s strength.\n \u0027That is the Pacific Project - the use of our own criminals and traitors against us; and if they can find such in our inner councils, the Earthmen might even succeed.\n \u0027The Foreign Agents Committee exists to combat that threat. In the accused, we touch the fringes of the web. We must go on-\u0027\n The speech did, at any rate.\n When it was concluded, Moreanu, pale, wide-eyed, pounded his fist, \u0027I demand my say -\u0027\n \u0027The accused may speak,\u0027 said the chairman.\n Moreanu rose and looked about him for a long moment. The room, fitted for an audience of seventy-five million by Community Wave, was unattended. There were the inquisitors, legal staff, official recorders - And with him, in the actual flesh, his guards.\n He would have done better with an audience. To whom could he otherwise appeal? His glance fled hopelessly from each face it touched, but could find nothing better.\n \u0027First,\u0027 he said, \u0027I deny the legality of this meeting. My constitutional rights of privacy and individuality have been denied. I have been tried by a group without standing as a court, by individuals convinced, in advance, of my guilt. I have been denied adequate opportunity to defend myself. In fact, I have been treated throughout as an already convicted criminal requiring only sentence.\n \u0027I deny, completely and without reservation, that I have been engaged in any activity detrimental to the state or tending to subvert any of its fundamental institutions.\n \u0027I accuse, vigorously and unreservedly, this Committee of deliberately using its powers to win political battles. I am guilty not of treason, but of disagreement. I disagree with a policy dedicated to the destruction of the larger part of the human race for reasons that are trivial and inhumane.\n \u0027Rather than destruction, we owe assistance to these men who are condemned to a harsh, unhappy life solely because it was our ancestors and not theirs who happened to reach the Outer Worlds first. With our technology and resources, they can yet re-create and redevelop -\u0027\n The chairman\u0027s voice rose above the intense near-whisper of Moreanu, \u0027You are out of order. The Committee is quite prepared to hear any remarks you make in your own defense, but a sermon on the rights of Earthmen is outside the legitimate realm of the discussion.\u0027\n The hearings were formally closed. It was a great political victory for the Independents; all would agree to that. Of the members of the Committee, only Franklin Maynard was not completely satisfied. A small, nagging doubt remained.\n He wondered -\n Should he try, one last time? Should he speak once more and then no more to that queer little monkey ambassador from Earth? He made his decision quickly and acted upon it instantly. Only a pause to arrange a witness, since even for himself an unwitnessed private communion with an Earthman might be dangerous.\n Luiz Moreno, Ambassador to Aurora from Earth, was, to put not too fine a point on it, a miserable figure of a man. And that wasn\u0027t exactly an accident. On the whole, the foreign diplomats of Earth tended to be dark, short, wizen, or weakly -or all four.\n That was only self-protection, since the Outer Worlds exerted strong attraction for any Earthman. Diplomats exposed to the allure of Aurora, for instance, could not but be exceedingly reluctant to return to Earth. Worse, and more dangerous, exposure meant a growing sympathy with the demigods of the stars and a growing alienation from the slum-dwellers of Earth.\n Unless, of course, the ambassador found himself rejected. Unless he found himself somewhat despised. And then, no more faithful servant of Earth could be imagined, no man less subject to corruption.\n The Ambassador to Earth was only five foot two, with a bald head and receding forehead, a pinkish affectation of beard and red-rimmed eyes. He was suffering from a slight cold, the occasional results whereof he smothered in a handkerchief. And yet, withal, he was a man of intellect.\n To Franklin Maynard, the sight and sound of the Earthman was distressing. He grew queasy at each cough and shuddered when the ambassador wiped his nose.\n Maynard said: \u0027Your excellency, we commune at my request because I wish to inform you that the Gathering has decided to ask your recall by your government.\u0027\n \u0027That is kind of you, councilor. I had an inkling of this. And for what reason?\u0027\n \u0027The reason is not within the bounds of discussion. I believe it is the prerogative of a sovereign state to decide for itself whether a foreign representative shall be persona grata or not. Nor do I think you really need enlightenment on this matter.\u0027\n \u0027Very well, then.\u0027 The ambassador paused to wield his handkerchief and murmur an apology. \u0027Is that all?\u0027\n Maynard said: \u0027Not quite. There are matters I would like to mention. Remain!\u0027\n The ambassador\u0027s reddened nostrils flared a bit, but he smiled, and said: \u0027An honor.\u0027\n \u0027Your world, excellency,\u0027 said Maynard, superciliously, \u0027displays a certain belligerence of late that we on Aurora find most annoying and unnecessary. I trust that you will find your return to Earth at this point a convenient opportunity to use your influence against further displays such as recently occurred in New York, where two Aurorans were manhandled by a mob. The payment of an indemnity may not be enough the next time.\u0027\n \u0027But that is emotional overflow, Councilor Maynard. Surely, you cannot consider youngsters shouting in the streets to be adequate representations of belligerence.\u0027\n \u0027It is backed by your government\u0027s actions in many ways. The recent arrest of Mr. Ernest Keilin, for instance.\u0027\n \u0027Which is a purely domestic affair,\u0027 said the ambassador, quietly.\n \u0027But not one to demonstrate a reasonable spirit toward the Outer Worlds. Keilin was one of the few Earthmen who until recently could yet make their voices heard. He was intelligent enough to realize that no divine right protects the inferior man simply because he is inferior.\u0027\n The ambassador arose: \u0027I am not interested in Auroran theories on racial differences.\u0027\n \u0027A moment. Your government may realize that much of their plans have gone awry with the arrest of your agent, Moreanu. Stress the fact that we of Aurora are much wiser than we have been prior to this arrest. It may serve to give them pause.\u0027\n \u0027Is Moreanu my agent? Really, councilor, if I am dis-accredited, I shall leave. But surely the loss of diplomatic immunity does not affect my personal immunity as an honest man from charges of espionage.\u0027\n \u0027Isn\u0027t that your job?\u0027\n \u0027Do Aurorans take it for granted that espionage and diplomacy are identical? My government will be glad to hear it. We shall take appropriate precautions.\u0027\n \u0027Then, you defend Moreanu? You deny that he has been working for Earth?\u0027\n \u0027I defend only myself. As to Moreanu, I am not stupid enough to say anything.\u0027\n \u0027Why stupid?\u0027\n Wouldn\u0027t a defense by myself be but another indictment against him? I neither accuse nor defend him. Your government\u0027s quarrel with Moreanu, like my government\u0027s with Keilin - whom you, by the way, are most suspiciously eager to defend - is an internal affair. I will leave now.\u0027\n The communion broke, and almost instantly the wall faded again. Hijkman was looking thoughtfully at Maynard.\n \u0027What do you think of him?\u0027 asked Maynard, grimly.\n \u0027Disgraceful that such a travesty of humanity should walk Aurora, I think.\u0027\n \u0027I agree with you, and yet... and yet -*\n \u0027Well?\u0027\n \u0027And yet I can almost find myself able to think that he is the master and that we dance to his piping. You know of Moreanu?\u0027\n \u0027Of course.\u0027\n Well, he will be convicted, sent to an asteroid. His party will be broken. Offhand, anyone would say that such actions represent a horrible defeat for Earth.\u0027\n \u0027Is there doubt in your mind that such is the case?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m not sure. Committee Chairman Hond insisted on airing his theory that Pacific Project was the name Earth gave to a device for using internal traitors on the Outer Worlds. But I don\u0027t think so. I\u0027m not sure the facts fit that. For instance, where did we get our evidence against Moreanu?\u0027\n \u0027I certainly can\u0027t say.\u0027\n \u0027Our agents, in the first place. But how did they get it? The evidence was a little too convincing. Moreanu could have guarded himself better -\u0027\n Maynard hesitated. He seemed to be attempting a blush, and failing. Well, to put it quickly, I think it was the Terrestrian Ambassador who somehow presented us with the most evidence. I think that he played on Moreanu\u0027s sympathy for Earth first to befriend him and then to betray him.\u0027\n Why?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. To insure war, perhaps - with this Pacific Project waiting for us.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t believe it.\u0027\n \u0027I know. I have no proof. Nothing but suspicion. The Committee wouldn\u0027t believe me either. It seemed to me, perhaps, that a last talk with the ambassador might reveal something, but his mere appearance antagonizes me, and I find I spend most of my time trying to remove him from my sight.\u0027\n \u0027Well, you are becoming emotional, my friend. It is a disgusting weakness. I hear that you have been appointed a delegate to the Interplanetary Gathering at Hesperus. I congratulate you.\u0027\n \u0027Thanks,\u0027 said Maynard, absently.\n Luiz Moreno, ex-Ambassador to Aurora, had been glad to return to Earth. He was away from the artificial landscapes that seemed to have no life of their own, but to exist only by virtue of the strong will of their possessors. Away from the too-beautiful men and women and from their ubiquitous, brooding robots.\n He was back to the hum of life and the shuffle of feet; the brushing of shoulders and the feeling of breath in the face.\n Not that he was able to enjoy these sensations entirely. The first days had been spent in lively conferences with the heads of Earth\u0027s government.\n In fact, it was not till nearly a week had passed, that an hour came in which he could consider himself truly relaxed.\n He was in the rarest of all appurtenances of Terrestrial Luxury - a roof garden. With him was Gustav Stein, the quite obscure physiologist, who was, nevertheless, one of the prime movers of the Plan, known to rumor as the Pacific Project.\n \u0027The confirmatory tests,\u0027 said Moreno, with an almost dreadful satisfaction, \u0027all check so far, do they not?\u0027\n \u0027So far. Only so far. We have miles to go.\"\n \u0027Yet they will continue to go well. To one who has lived on Aurora for nearly a year, as I have, there can be no doubt but that we\u0027re on the right track.\u0027\n \u0027Um-m-m, Nevertheless, I will go only by the laboratory reports.\u0027\n \u0027And quite rightly.\u0027 His little body was almost stiff with gloating. \u0027Some day, it will be different. Stein, you have not met these men, these Outer Worlders. You may have come across the tourists, perhaps, in their special hotels, or riding through the streets in inclosed cars, equipped with the purest of private, air-conditioned atmospheres for their well-bred nostrils; observing the sights through a movable periscope and shuddering away from the touch of an Earthman.\n \u0027But you have not met them on their own world, secure in then\u0027 own sickly, rotting greatness. Go, Stein, and be despised a while. Go, and find how well you can compete with their own trained lawns as something to be gently trod upon.\n \u0027And yet, when I pulled the proper cords, Ion Moreanu fell - Ion Moreanu, the only man among them with the capacity to understand the workings of another\u0027s mind. It is the crisis that we have passed now. We front a smooth path now.\u0027\n Satisfaction! Satisfaction!\n \u0027As for Keiliri,\u0027 he said suddenly, more to himself than to Stein, \u0027he can be turned loose now. There\u0027s little he can say, hereafter, that can endanger anything. In fact, I have an idea. The interplanetary Conference opens on Hesperus within the month. He can be sent to report the meeting. It will be an earnest of our friendliness - and keep him away for the summer. I think it can be arranged.\u0027\n It was.\n Of all the Outer Worlds, Hesperus was the smallest, the latest settled, the furthest from Earth. Hence the name. In a physical sense, it was not best suited to a great diplomatic gathering, since its facilities were small. For instance, the available community-wave network could not possibly be stretched to cover all the delegates, secretarial staff, and administrators necessary in a convocation of fifty planets. So meetings in person were arranged in buildings impressed for the purpose.\n Yet there was a symbolism in the choice of meeting place that escaped practically nobody. Hesperus, of all the Worlds, was furthest removed from Earth. But the spatial distance -one hundred parsecs or more - was the least of it. The important point was that Hesperus had been colonized not by Earthmen, but by men from the Outer World of Faunus.\n It was therefore of the second generation, and so it had no \u0027Mother Earth.\u0027 Earth to it was but a vague grandmother, lost in the stars.\n As is usual in all such gatherings, little work is actually done on the session floors. That space is reserved for the official soundings of whatever is primarily intended for home ears. The actual swapping and horse-trading takes place in the lobbies and at the lunch-tables and many of irresolvable conflict has softened over the soup and vanished over the nuts.\n And yet particular difficulties were present in this particular case. Not in all worlds was the community-wave as paramount and all-pervading as it was on Aurora, but it was prominent in all. It was, therefore, with a certain sense of outrage and loss that the tall, dignified men found it necessary to approach one another in the flesh, without the comforting privacy of the invisible wall between, without the warm knowledge of the breakswitch at their fingertips.\n They faced one another in uneasy semi-embarrassment and tried not to watch one another eat; tried not to shrink at the unmeant touch. Even robot service was rationed.\n Ernest Keilin, the only accredited video-representative from Earth, was aware of some of these matters only in the vague way they are described here. A more precise insight he could not have. Nor could anyone brought up in a society where human beings exist only in the plural, and where a house need only be deserted to be feared. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-early-asimov-volume-3/page-21.html","bookId":1748,"book":{"id":1748,"title":"The Early Asimov Volume 3","description":"Storyline: \n The Early Asimov Volume 3 (Panther Science Fiction) \n The Early Asimov or, Eleven Years of Trying is a 1972 collection of short stories by Isaac Asimov.
