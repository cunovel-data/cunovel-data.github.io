It was the capital of a Galactic Confederation greater than ours.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, then, let\u0027s say it was an ancient capital. I\u0027ll admit that and leave the rest to an archaeologist.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Archaeologists are no use. What I\u0027ve discovered needs a specialist in its own field. And you\u0027re on the Board.\u0027\\n\\n Brand Gorla looked doubtful. He remembered Theo Realo in senior year - a little white misfit of a human who skulked somewhere in the background of his reminiscences. It had been a long time ago, but the albino had been queer. That was easy to remember. And he was still queer.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll try to help,\u0027 Brand said, \u0027if you\u0027ll tell me what you want.\u0027\\n\\n Theor watched intently, \u0027I want you to place certain facts before the Board. Will you promise that?\u0027\\n\\n Brand hedged, \u0027Even if I help you along, Theor, I\u0027ll have to remind you that I\u0027m junior member of the Psychological Board. I haven\u0027t much influence.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You must do your best. The facts will speak for themselves.\u0027 The albino\u0027s hands were trembling.\\n\\n \u0027Go ahead.\u0027 Brand resigned himself. The man was an old school fellow. You couldn\u0027t be too arbitrary about things.\\n\\n Brand Gorla leaned back and relaxed. The light of Arcturus shone through the ceiling-high windows, diffused and mellowed by the polarizing glass. Even this diluted version of sunlight was too much for the pink eyes of the other, and he shaded his eyes as he spoke.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve lived on Dorlis twenty-five years, Brand,\u0027 he said, \u0027I\u0027ve poked into places no one today knew existed, and I\u0027ve found things. Dorlis was the scientific and cultural capital of a civilization greater than ours. Yes it was, and particularly in psychology.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Things in the past always seem greater.\u0027 Brand condescended a smile. \u0027There is a theorem to that effect which you\u0027ll find in any elementary text. Freshmen invariably call it the \u0027GOD Theorem.\u0027 Stands for \"Good-Old-Days,\" you know. But go on.\u0027\\n\\n Theor frowned at the digression. He hid the beginning of a sneer, \u0027You can always dismiss an uncomfortable fact by pinning a dowdy label to it. But tell me this. What do you know of Psychological Engineering?\u0027\\n\\n Brand shrugged, \u0027No such thing. Anyway, not in the strict mathematical sense. All propaganda and advertising is a crude form of hit-and-miss Psych Engineering - and pretty effective sometimes. Maybe that\u0027s what you mean.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not at all. I mean actual experimentation, with masses of people, under controlled conditions, and over a period of years.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Such things have been discussed. It\u0027s not feasible in practice. Our social structure couldn\u0027t stand much of it, and we don\u0027t know enough to set up effective controls.\u0027\\n\\n Theor suppressed excitement, \u0027But the ancients did know enough. And they did set up controls.\u0027\\n\\n Brand considered phlegmatically, \u0027Startling and interesting, but how do you know?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because I found the documents relating to it.\u0027 He paused breathlessly. \u0027An entire planet, Brand. A complete world picked to suit, peopled with beings under strict control from every angle. Studied, and charted, and experimented upon. Don\u0027t you get the picture?\u0027\\n\\n Brand noted none of the usual stigmata of mental uncon-trol. A closer investigation, perhaps -\\n\\n He said evenly, \u0027You must have been misled. It\u0027s thoroughly impossible. You can\u0027t control humans like that. Too many variables.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And that\u0027s the point, Brand. They weren\u0027t humans.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They were robots, positronic robots. A whole world of them, Brand, with nothing to do but live and react and be observed by a set of psychologists that were real psychologists.\u0027\\n\\n That\u0027s mad!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I have proof - because that robot world still exists. The First Confederation went to pieces, but that robot world kept on going. It still exists.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And how do you know?\u0027\\n\\n Theor Realo stood up. \u0027Because I\u0027ve been there these last twenty-five years!\u0027\\n\\n The Board Master threw his formal red-edged gown aside and reached into a pocket for a long, gnarled and decidedly unofficial cigar.\\n\\n \u0027Preposterous,\u0027 he grunted, \u0027and thoroughly insane.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Exactly,\u0027 said Brand, \u0027and I can\u0027t spring it on the Board just like that. They wouldn\u0027t listen. I\u0027ve got to get this across to you first, and then, if you can put your authority behind it -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, nuts? I never heard anything as - Who is the fellow?\u0027\\n\\n Brand sighed, \u0027A crank, I\u0027ll admit that. He was in my class at Arcturus U. and a crack-pot albino even then. Maladjusted as the devil, hipped on ancient history, and just the kind that gets an idea and goes through with it by plain, dumb plugging. He\u0027s poked about in Dorlis for twenty-five years, he says. He\u0027s got the complete records of practically an entire civilization.\u0027\\n\\n The Board Master puffed furiously. \u0027Yeah, I know. In the telestat serials, the brilliant amateur always uncovers the great things. The free lance. The lone wolf. Nuts! Have you consulted the Department of Archaeology?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Certainly. And the result was interesting. No one bothers with Dorlis. This isn\u0027t just ancient history, you see. It\u0027s a matter of fifteen thousand years. It\u0027s practically myth. Reputable archaeologists don\u0027t waste too much time with it. It\u0027s just the thing a book-struck layman with a single-track mind would uncover. After this, of course, if the business turns out right, Dorlis will become an archaeologist\u0027s paradise.\u0027\\n\\n The Board Master screwed his homely face into an appalling grimace. \u0027It\u0027s very unflattering to the ego. If there\u0027s any truth in all this, the so-called First Confederation must have had a grasp of psychology so far past ours, as to make us out to be blithering imbeciles. Too, they\u0027d have to build positronic robots that would be about seventy-five orders of magnitude above anything we\u0027ve even blueprinted. Galaxy! Think of the mathematics involved.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Look, sir, I\u0027ve consulted just about everybody. I wouldn\u0027t bring this thing to you if I weren\u0027t certain that I had every angle checked. I went to Blak just about the first thing, and he\u0027s consultant mathematician to United Robots. He says there\u0027s no limit to these things. Given the time, the money, and the advance in psychology - get that - robots like that could be built right now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What proof has he?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who, Blak?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, no! Your friend. The albino. You said he had papers.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He has. I\u0027ve got them here. He\u0027s got documents - and there\u0027s no denying their antiquity. I\u0027ve had that checked every way from Sunday. I can\u0027t read them, of course. I don\u0027t know if anyone can, except Theor Realo.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s stacking the deck, isn\u0027t it? We have to take his say-so.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, in a way. But he doesn\u0027t claim to be able to decipher more than portions. He says it is related to ancient Centaurian, and I\u0027ve put linguists to work on it. It can be cracked and if his translation isn\u0027t accurate, we\u0027ll know about it.\"\\n\\n \u0027All right. Let\u0027s see it.\u0027\\n\\n Brand Gorla brought out the plastic-mounted documents. The Board Master tossed them aside and reached for the translation. Smoke billowed as he read.\\n\\n \u0027Humph,\u0027 was his comment. \u0027Further details are on Dorlis, I suppose.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Theor claims that there are some hundred to two hundred tons of blueprints altogether, on the brain plan of the posi-tronic robots alone. They\u0027re still there in the original vault. But that\u0027s the least of it. He\u0027s been on the robot world itself. He\u0027s got photocasts, teletype recordings, all sorts of details. They\u0027re not integrated, and obviously the work of a layman who knows next to nothing about psychology. Even so, he\u0027s managed to get enough data to prove pretty conclusively that the world he was on wasn\u0027t... uh... natural.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve got that with you, too.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All of it. Most of it\u0027s on microfilm, but I\u0027ve brought the projector. Here are your eyepieces.\u0027\\n\\n An hour later, the Board Master said, \u0027I\u0027ll call a Board Meeting tomorrow and push this through.\u0027\\n\\n Brand Gorla grinned tightly, \u0027We\u0027ll send a commission to Dorlis?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027When,\u0027 said the Board Master dryly, \u0027and if we can get an appropriation out of the University for such an affair. Leave this material with me for the while, please. I want to study it a\\n\\n little more.\u0027\\n\\n Theoretically, the Governmental Department of Science and Technology exercises administrative control over all scientific investigation. Actually, however, the pure research groups of the large universities are thoroughly autonomous bodies, and, as a general rule, the Government does not care to dispute that. But a general rule is not necessarily a universal rule.\\n\\n And so, although the Board Master scowled and fumed and swore, there was no way of refusing Wynne Murry an interview. To give Murry his complete title, he was under secretary in charge of psychology, psychopathy and mental technology. And he was a pretty fair psychologist in his own right.\\n\\n So the Board Master might glare, but that was all.\\n\\n Secretary Murry ignored the glare cheerfully. He rubbed his long chin against the grain and said, \u0027It amounts to a case of insufficient information. Shall we put it that way?\u0027\\n\\n The Board Master said frigidly, \u0027I don\u0027t see what information you want. The government\u0027s say in university appropriations is purely advisory, and in this case, I might say, the advice is unwelcome.\u0027\\n\\n Murry shrugged, \u0027I have no quarrel with the appropriation. But you\u0027re not going to leave the planet without government permit. That\u0027s where the insufficient information comes in.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There is no information other than we\u0027ve given you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But things have leaked out. All this is childish and rather unnecessary secrecy.\u0027\\n\\n The old psychologist flushed. \u0027Secrecy! If you don\u0027t know the academic way of life, I can\u0027t help you. Investigations, especially those of major importance, aren\u0027t, and can\u0027t be, made public, until definite progress has been made. When we get back, we\u0027ll send you copies of whatever papers we publish.\u0027\\n\\n Murry shook his head, \u0027Uh-uh. Not enough. You\u0027re going to Dorlis, aren\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ve informed the Department of Science of that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why do you want to know?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because it\u0027s big, or the Board Master wouldn\u0027t go himself, What\u0027s this about an older civilization and a world of robots?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, then, you know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Only vague notions we\u0027ve been able to scrabble up. I want the details.\u0027\\n\\n There are none that we know now. We won\u0027t know until we\u0027re on Dorlis.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then I\u0027m going with you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You see, I want the details, too.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ah,\u0027 Murry unfolded his legs and stood up, \u0027now you\u0027re asking the questions. It\u0027s no use, now. I know that the universities aren\u0027t keen on government supervision; and I know that I can expect no willing help from any academic source. But, by Arcturus, I\u0027m going to get help this time, and I don\u0027t care how you fight it. Your expedition is going nowhere, unless I go with you - representing the government.\u0027\\n\\n Dorlis, as a world, is not impressive. It\u0027s importance to Galactic economy is nil, its position far off the great trade routes, its natives backward and unenlightened, its history obscure. And yet somewhere in the heaps of rubble that clutter an ancient world, there is obscure evidence of an influx of flame and destruction that destroyed the Dorlis of an earlier day -the greater capital of a greater Federation.\\n\\n And somewhere in that rubble, men of a newer world poked and probed and tried to understand.\\n\\n The Board Master shook his head and then pushed back his grizzling hair. He hadn\u0027t shaved in a week.\\n\\n \u0027The trouble is,\u0027 he said, \u0027that we have no point of reference. The language can be broken, I suppose, but nothing can be done with the notation.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think a great deal has been done.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Stabs in the dark! Guessing games based on the translations of your albino friend. I won\u0027t base any hopes on that.\u0027\\n\\n Brand said, \u0027Nuts! You spent two years on the Nimian Anomaly, and so far only two months on this, which happens to be a hundred thousand times the job. It\u0027s something else that\u0027s getting you.\u0027 He smiled grimly. \u0027It doesn\u0027t take a psychologist to see that the government man is in your hair.\u0027\\n\\n The Board Master bit the end off a cigar and spat it four feet. He said slowly, \u0027There are three things about the mule-headed idiot that make me sore. First, I don\u0027t like government interference. Second, I don\u0027t like a stranger sniffing about when we\u0027re on top of the biggest thing in the history of psychology. Third, what in the Galaxy does he want? What is he after?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What should he be after? Have you thought of it at all?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. Frankly, I don\u0027t care. I\u0027d ignore him if I were you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You would,\u0027 said the Board Master violently. \u0027You would! You think the government\u0027s entrance into this affair need only be ignored. I suppose you know that this Murry calls himself a psychologist?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And I suppose you know he\u0027s been displaying a devouring interest in all that we\u0027ve been doing.\u0027\\n\\n That, I should say, would be natural.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh! And you know further-\u0027 His voice dropped with startling suddenness. \u0027All right, Murry\u0027s at the door. Take it easy.\u0027\\n\\n Wynne Murry grinned a greeting, but the Board Master nodded unsmilingly.\\n\\n \u0027Well, sir,\u0027 said Murry bluffly, \u0027do you know I\u0027ve been on my feet for forty-eight hours? You\u0027ve got something here. Something big.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thank you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, no. I\u0027m serious. The robot world exists.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did you think it didn\u0027t?\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-early-asimov-volume-3/page-7.html","bookId":1748,"book":{"id":1748,"title":"The Early Asimov Volume 3","description":"Storyline: The Early Asimov Volume 3 (Panther Science Fiction) \\n The Early Asimov or, Eleven Years of Trying is a 1972 collection of short stories by Isaac Asimov.
