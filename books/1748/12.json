If you stay longer, the atmosphere may have bad effects. I thank you humbly for your kindness.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I thank you humbly for yours.\u0027 The Cepheid had also risen.\\n\\n Antyok said, \u0027Most of your people, by the way, have accepted our offers to them to study the make-up of our modern spaceships. You understand, I suppose, that the purpose was to study the reactions of your people to our technology. I trust that conforms with your sense of propriety.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You need not apologize. I, myself, have now the makings of a human pilot. It was most interesting. It recalls our own efforts - and reminds us of how nearly on the right track we were.\u0027\\n\\n The Cepheid left, and Antyok sat, frowning.\\n\\n \u0027Well,\u0027 he said to Bannerd, a little sharply. \u0027You remember our agreement, I hope. This interview can\u0027t be published.\u0027\\n\\n Bannerd shrugged, \u0027Very well.\u0027\\n\\n Antyok was at his seat, and his fingers fumbled with the small metal figurine upon his desk, \u0027What do you think of all this, Bannerd?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I am sorry for them. I think I understand how they feel. We must educate them out of it. The Philosophy can do it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You think so?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We can\u0027t let them go, of course.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, no. Out of the question. We have too much to learn from them. This feeling of theirs is only a passing stage. They\u0027ll think differently, especially when we allow them the completest independence.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Maybe. What do you think of the fluoro-globes, Bannerd? He liked them. It might be a gesture of the right sort to order several thousand of them. The Galaxy knows, they\u0027re a drug on the market right now, and cheap enough.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sounds like a good idea,\u0027 said Bannerd.\\n\\n \u0027The Bureau would never agree, though. I know them.\u0027\\n\\n The newsman\u0027s eyes narrowed, \u0027But it might be just the thing. They need new interests.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes? Well, we could do something. I could include your transcript of the interview as part of a report and just emphasize the matter of the globes a bit. After all, you\u0027re a member of the Philosophy and might have influence with important people, whose word with the Bureau might carry much more weight than mine. You understand-?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 mused Bannerd. \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n From:,AdHQ-Cephl8\\n\\n To: BuOuProv\\n\\n Subject: OuProv Project 2910, Part II; Birth rate of non-Humans on Cepheus 18, Investigation of.\\n\\n Reference:\\n\\n (a) BuOuProv letr.

Morily, Chief,\\n\\n BuOuProv, 283/977 G.E.\\n\\n V\\n\\n The dinner was over, the wine had been brought in and the cigars were out. The groups of talkers had formed, and the captain of the merchant fleet was the center of the largest. His brilliant white uniform quite outsparkled his listeners.\\n\\n He was almost complacent in his speech: The trip was nothing. I\u0027ve had more than three hundred ships under me before this. Still, I\u0027ve never had a cargo quite like this. What do you want with five thousand fluoro-globes on this desert, by the Galaxy!\u0027\\n\\n Loodun Antyok laughed gently. He shrugged, \u0027For the non-Humans. It wasn\u0027t a difficult cargo, I hope.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, not difficult. But bulky. They\u0027re fragile, and I couldn\u0027t carry more than twenty to a ship, with all the government regulations concerning packing and precautions against breakage. But it\u0027s the government\u0027s money, I suppose.\u0027\\n\\n Zammo smiled grimly. \u0027Is this your first experience with government methods, captain?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Galaxy, no,\u0027 exploded the spaceman. \u0027I try to avoid it, of course, but you can\u0027t help getting entangled on occasion. And it\u0027s an abhorrent thing when you are, and that\u0027s the truth. The red tape! The paper work! It\u0027s enough to stunt your growth and curdle your circulation. It\u0027s a tumor, a cancerous growth on the Galaxy. I\u0027d wipe out the whole mess.\u0027\\n\\n Antyok said, \u0027You\u0027re unfair, captain. You don\u0027t understand.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes? Well, now, as one of these bureaucrats,\u0027 and he smiled amiably at the word, \u0027suppose you explain your side of the situation, administrator.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, now,\u0027 Antyok seemed confused, \u0027government is a serious and complicated business. We\u0027ve got thousands of planets to worry about in this Empire of ours and billions of people. It\u0027s almost past human ability to supervise the business of governing without the tightest sort of organization. I think there are something like four hundred million men today in the Imperial Administrative Service alone, and in order to coordinate their efforts and to pool their knowledge, you must have what you call red tape and paper work. Every bit of it, senseless though it may seem, annoying though it may be, has its uses. Every piece of paper is a thread binding the labors of four hundred million humans. Abolish the Administrative Service and you abolish the Empire; and with it, interstellar peace, order and civilization.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Come -\u0027 said the captain.\\n\\n \u0027No. I mean it.\u0027 Antyok was earnestly breathless. \u0027The rules and system of the Administrative set-up must be sufficiently all-embracing and rigid so that in case of incompetent officials, and sometimes one is appointed - you may laugh, but there are incompetent scientists, and newsmen, and captains, too - in case of incompetent officials, I say, little harm will be done. For, at the worst, the system can move by itself.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 grunted the captain, sourly, \u0027and if a capable administrator should be appointed? He is then caught by the same rigid web and is forced into mediocrity.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not at all,\u0027 replied Antyok, warmly. \u0027A capable man can work within the limits of the rules and accomplish what he wishes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How?\u0027 asked Bannerd.\\n\\n \u0027Well... well -\u0027 Antyok was suddenly ill at ease. \u0027One method is to get yourself an A-priority project, or double-A, if possible.\u0027\\n\\n The captain leaned his head back for laughter, but never quite made it, for the door was flung open and frightened men were pouring in. The shouts made no sense at first. Then:\\n\\n \u0027Sir, the ships are gone. These non-Humans have taken them by force.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What? All?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Every one. Ships and creatures -\u0027\\n\\n It was two hours later that the four were together again, alone in Antyok\u0027s office now.\\n\\n Antyok said coldly, \u0027They\u0027ve made no mistakes. There\u0027s not a ship left behind, not even your training ship, Zammo. And there isn\u0027t a government ship available in this entire half of the Sector. By the time we organize a pursuit they\u0027ll be out of the Galaxy and halfway to the Magellanic Clouds. Captain, it was your responsibility to maintain an adequate guard.\u0027\\n\\n The captain cried, \u0027It was our first day out of space. Who could have known -\u0027\\n\\n Zammo interrupted fiercely, \u0027Wait a while, captain. I\u0027m beginning to understand. Antyok,\u0027 his voice was hard, \u0027you engineered this.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I?\u0027 Antyok\u0027s expression was strangely cool, almost indifferent.\\n\\n \u0027You told us this evening that a clever administrator got an A-priority project assigned to accomplish what he wished. You got such a project in order to help the non-Humans escape.\u0027\\n\\n 1 did? I beg your pardon, but how could that be? It was you yourself in one of your reports that brought up the problem of the failing birth rate. It was Bannerd, here, whose sensational articles frightened the Bureau into making a double A-priority project out of it. I had nothing to do with it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You suggested that I mention the birth rate,\u0027 said Zammo, violently.\\n\\n \u0027Did I?\u0027 said Antyok, composedly.\\n\\n \u0027And for that matter,\u0027 roared Bannerd, suddenly, \u0027you suggested that I mention the birth rate in my articles.\u0027\\n\\n The three ringed him now and hemmed him in. Antyok leaned back in his chair and said easily, \u0027I don\u0027t know what you mean by suggestions. If you are accusing me, please stick to evidence - legal evidence. The laws of the Empire go by written, filmed or transcribed material, or by witnessed statements. All my letters as administrator are on file here, at the Bureau, and at other places. I never asked for an A-priority project. The Bureau assigned it to me, and Zammo and Bannerd are responsible for that. In print, at any rate.\u0027\\n\\n Zammo\u0027s voice was an almost inarticulate growl, \u0027You hoodwinked me into teaching the creatures how to handle a spaceship.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It was your suggestion. I have your report proposing they be studied in their reaction to human tools on file. So has the Bureau. The evidence - the legal evidence, is plain. I had nothing to do with it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nor with the globes?\u0027 demanded Bannerd.\\n\\n The captain howled suddenly, \u0027You had my ships brought here purposely. Five thousand globes! You knew it would require hundreds of craft.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I never asked for globes,\u0027 said Antyok, coldly. \u0027That was the Bureau\u0027s idea, although I think Bannerd\u0027s friends of The Phil-osphy helped that along.\u0027\\n\\n Bannerd fairly choked. He spat out, \u0027You were asking that Cepheid leader if he could read minds. You were telling him to express interest in the globes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Come, now. You prepared the transcript of the conversation yourself, and that, too, is on file. You can\u0027t prove it.\u0027 He stood up, \u0027You\u0027ll have to excuse me. I must prepare a report for the Bureau.\u0027\\n\\n At the door, Antyok turned, \u0027In a way, the problem of the non-Humans is solved, even if only to their own satisfaction. They\u0027ll breed now, and have a world they\u0027ve earned themselves. It\u0027s what they wanted.\\n\\n \u0027Another thing. Don\u0027t accuse me of silly things. I\u0027ve been in the Service for twenty-seven years, and I assure you that my paper work is proof enough that I have been thoroughly correct in everything I have done. And captain, I\u0027ll be glad to continue our discussion of earlier this evening at your convenience and explain how a capable administrator can work through red tape and still get what he wants.\u0027\\n\\n It was remarkable that such a round, smooth baby-face could wear a smile quite so sardonic.\\n\\n From: BuOuProv\\n\\n To: Loodun Antyok, Chief Public Administrator, A-8\\n\\n Subject: Administrative Service, Standing in.\\n\\n Reference:\\n\\n (a) AdServ Court Decision 22874-Q, dated 1 /978 G.E.\\n\\n 1. In view of the favorable opinion handed down in reference (a) you are hereby absolved of all responsibility for the flight of non-Humans on Cepheus 18. It is requested that you hold yourself in readiness for your next appointment.\\n\\n R. Horpritt. Chief,\\n\\n AdServ, 15/978 G.E.\\n\\n The letters that form a major part of this story (which contains one of my rare examples of extraterrestrial intelligences) are, you will be glad to know, based on the kind of material that routinely passed in and out of the N.A.E.S. (and, for all I know, still does). The turgid style is not my invention. I couldn\u0027t invent it if I tried.\\n\\n When the story appeared, L. Sprague de Camp happily pointed out one flaw in the letter style: I had carelessly made someone in lower position, who was addressing someone in higher position, say, \u0027it is requested\u0027 instead of \u0027it is suggested.\u0027 The underling can humbly suggest, but only an overling can harshly request.\\n\\n \u0027Blind Alley\u0027 has one distinction I would like to mention.\\n\\n After the war, there began that flood of science fiction anthologies that has been growing in width and depth ever since. Few, if any, science fiction writers have been anthologized as often as I have and the first one of my stories to be anthologized was not \u0027Nightfall\u0027 or a \u0027positronic robot\u0027 story or a \u0027Foundation\u0027 story. It was \u0027Blind Alley.\u0027\\n\\n In early 1946 Groff Conklin was putting out the first of his many science fiction anthologies - one called \u0027The Best of Science Fiction\u0027 - and there you will find \u0027Blind Alley.\u0027 That story, for which Campbell had paid $148.75 (He a word) then earned another $42.50 Qc a word). This meant that \u0027Blind Alley\u0027 had earned me 21/4c a word, which was a record high at the time. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-early-asimov-volume-3/page-12.html","bookId":1748,"book":{"id":1748,"title":"The Early Asimov Volume 3","description":"Storyline: The Early Asimov Volume 3 (Panther Science Fiction) \\n The Early Asimov or, Eleven Years of Trying is a 1972 collection of short stories by Isaac Asimov.
