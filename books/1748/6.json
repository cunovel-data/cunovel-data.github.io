No more threats! I come now to appeal to your finer feelings, Graham\u0027 - he went through a slight choking interlude - \u0027I love you like a son. This skunk de Meister must disappear. You must write more de Meister stories for my sake. Graham - I will tell you something in private. My wife is in love with this detective. She tells me I am not romantic. I! Not romantic! Can you understand it?\u0027\n \u0027I can,\u0027 was the tragic response. \u0027He fascinates all women.\u0027\n \u0027With that face? With that monocle?\u0027\n \u0027It says so in all my books.\u0027\n MacDunlap stiffened. \u0027Ah ha. You again. Dope! If only you ever stopped long enough to let your mind know what your typewriter was saying.\u0027\n \u0027You insisted. Feminine trade.\u0027 Graham didn\u0027t care any more. Women! He snickered bitterly. Nothing wrong with any of them that a block-buster wouldn\u0027t fix.\n MacDunlap hemmed. \u0027Well, feminine trade. Very necessary. - But Graham, what shall I do? It\u0027s not only my wife. She owns fifty shares in MacDunlap, Inc. in her own name. If she leaves me, I lose control. Think of it, Graham. The catastrophe to the publishing world.\u0027\n \u0027Grew, old chap,\u0027 Graham sighed a sigh so deep, his toenails quivered sympathetically. \u0027I might as well tell you. June, my fiancee, you know, loves this worm. And he loves her because she is the prototype of Letitia Reynolds.\"\n \u0027The what of Letitia?\u0027 asked MacDunlap, vaguely suspecting an insult.\n \u0027Never mind. My life is ruined.\u0027 He smiled bravely and choked back the unmanly tears, after the first two had dripped off the end of his nose.\n \u0027My poor boy!\u0027 The two gripped hands convulsively.\n \u0027Caught in a vise by this foul monster,\u0027 said Graham.\n \u0027Trapped like a German in Russia,\u0027 said MacDunlap.\n \u0027Victim of an inhuman fiend,\u0027 said Graham.\n \u0027Exactly,\u0027 said MacDunlap. He wrung Graham\u0027s hand as if he were milking a cow. \u0027You\u0027ve got to write de Meister stories and get him back where, next to Hell, he most belongs. Right?\u0027\n \u0027Right! But there\u0027s one little catch.\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027\n \u0027I can\u0027t write. He\u0027s so real now, I can\u0027t put him into a book.\"\n MacDunlap caught the significance of the massed drifts of used paper on the floor. He held his head and groaned, \u0027My corporation! My wife!\u0027\n \u0027There\u0027s always the Army,\u0027 said Graham.\n MacDunlap looked up. \u0027What about Death on the Third Deck, the novel I rejected three weeks ago?\u0027\n \u0027That doesn\u0027t count. It\u0027s past history. It\u0027s already affected him.\u0027\n \u0027Without being published?\u0027\n \u0027Sure. That\u0027s the story I mentioned his draft board in. The one that put him in 1 -A.\u0027\n \u0027I could think of better places to put him.\u0027\n \u0027MacDunlap!\u0027 Graham Dorn jumped up, and grappled MacDunlap\u0027s lapel. \u0027Maybe it can be revised.\u0027\n MacDunlap coughed hackingly, and stifled out a dim grunt.\n \u0027We can put anything we want into it.\"\n MacDunlap choked a bit.\n \u0027We can fix things up.\u0027\n MacDunlap turned blue in the face.\n Graham shook the lapel and everything thereto attached, \u0027Say something, won\u0027t you?\u0027\n MacDunlap wrenched away and took a tablespoon of cough syrup. He held his hand over his heart and patted it a bit. He shook his head and gestured with his eyebrows.\n Graham shrugged. \u0027Well, if you just want to be sullen, go ahead. I\u0027ll revise it without you.\u0027\n He located the manuscript and tried his fingers gingerly on the typewriter. They went smoothly, with practically no creaking at the joints. He put on speed, more speed, and then went into his usual race, with the portable jouncing along merrily under the accustomed head of steam.\n \u0027It\u0027s working,\u0027 he shouted. \u0027I can\u0027t write new stories, but I can revise old, unpublished ones.\u0027\n MacDunlap watched over his shoulder. He breathed only at odd moments.\n \u0027Faster,\u0027 said MacDunlap, \u0027faster!\u0027\n \u0027Faster than thirty-five?\u0027 said Graham, sternly. \u0027OPA* forbid! Five more minutes.\u0027\n \u0027Will he be there?\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s always there. He\u0027s been at her house every evening this week.\u0027 He spat out the fine ivory dust into which he had ground the last inch of his incisors. \u0027But God help you if your secretary falls down on the job.\u0027\n \u0027My boy, on my secretary you can depend.\u0027\n \u0027She\u0027s got to read that revision by nine.\u0027\n \u0027If she doesn\u0027t drop dead.\u0027\n \u0027With my luck, she will. Will she believe it?\u0027\n \u0027Every word. She\u0027s seen de Meister. She knows he exists.\u0027\n Brakes screeched, and Graham\u0027s soul cringed in sympathy with every molecule of rubber frictioned off the tires.\n He bounded up the stairs, MacDunlap hobbling after.\n He rang the bell and burst in at the door. Reginald de\n * The Office of Price Administration was in charge of gasoline rationing at this period. Remember \u0027A\u0027 stickers? D.R.B.\n Meister standing directly inside received the full impact of a pointing finger, and only a rapid backward movement of the head kept him from becoming a one-eyed mythical character.\n June Billings stood aside, silent and uncomfortable.\n \u0027Reginald de Meister,\u0027 growled Graham, in sinister tones, \u0027prepare to meet your doom.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, boy,\u0027 said MacDunlap, \u0027are you going to get it.\u0027\n \u0027And to what,\u0027 asked de Meister, \u0027am I indebted for your dramatic but unilluminatin\u0027 statement? Confusin\u0027, don\u0027t you know.\u0027 He lit a cigarette with a fine gesture and smiled.\n \u0027Hello, Gramie,\u0027 said June, tearfully.\n \u0027Scram, vile woman.\u0027\n June sniffed. She felt like a heroine out of a book, torn by her own emotions. Naturally, she was having the time of her life.\n So she let the tears dribble and looked forlorn.\n To return to the subject, what is this all about?\" asked de Meister, wearily.\n \u0027I have rewritten Death on the Third Deck.\u0027\n \u0027Well?\u0027\n \u0027The revision,\u0027 continued Graham, \u0027is at present in the hands of MacDunlap\u0027s secretary, a girl on the style of Miss Billings, my fiancee that was. That is, she is a girl who aspires to the status of a moron, but has not yet quite attained it. She\u0027ll believe every word.\u0027\n \u0027Well?\u0027\n Graham\u0027s voice grew ominous, \u0027You remember, perhaps, Sancha Rodriguez?\u0027\n For the first time, Reginald de Meister shuddered. He caught his cigarette as it dropped. \u0027She was killed by Sam Blake in the sixth chapter. She was in love with me. Really, old fellow, what messes you get me into.\u0027\n \u0027Not half the mess you\u0027re in now, old chap. Sancha Rodriguez did not die in the revision.\u0027\n \u0027Die!\u0027 came a sharp, but clear female voice. \u0027I\u0027ll show him if I died. And where have you been this last month, you two-crosser?\u0027\n De Meister did not catch his cigarette this time. He didn\u0027t even try. He recognized the apparition. To an unprejudiced observer, it might have been merely a svelte Latin girl equipped with dark, flashing eyes, and long, glittering fingernails, but to de Meister, it was Sancha Rodriguez - undead!\n MacDunlap\u0027s secretary had read and believed.\n \u0027Miss Rodriguez,\u0027 throbbed de Meister, charmingly, \u0027how fascinatin\u0027 to see you.\u0027\n \u0027Mrs. de Meister to you, you double-timer, you two-crosser, you scum of the ground, you scorpion of the grass. And who is this woman?\u0027\n June retreated with dignity behind the nearest chair.\n \u0027Mrs. de Meister,\u0027 said Reginald pleadingly, and turned helplessly to Graham Dorn.\n \u0027Oh, you have forgotten, have you, you smooth talker, you low dog. I\u0027ll show you what it means to deceive a weak woman. I\u0027ll make you mince-meat with my fingernails.\u0027\n De Meister back-pedaled furiously. \u0027But darling -\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t you make sweet talk. What are you doing with this woman?\u0027\n \u0027But, darling -\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t give me any explanation. What are you doing with this woman?\u0027\n \u0027But darling-\u0027\n \u0027Shut up! What are you doing with this woman?\u0027\n Reginald de Meister was up in a corner, and Mrs. de Meister shook her fists at him. \u0027Answer me!\u0027\n De Meister disappeared.\n Mrs. de Meister disappeared right after him.\n June Billings collapsed into real tears.\n Graham Dorn folded his arms and looked sternly at her.\n MacDunlap rubbed his hands and took a kidney pill.\n \u0027It wasn\u0027t my fault, Gramie,\u0027 said June. \u0027You said in your books he fascinated all women, so I couldn\u0027t help it. Deep inside, I hated him all along. You believe me, don\u0027t you?\u0027\n \u0027A likely story!\u0027 said Graham, sitting down next to her on the sofa. \u0027A likely story. But I forgive you, maybe.\u0027\n MacDunlap said tremulously, \u0027My boy, you have saved my stocks. Also, my wife, of course. And remember - you promised me one de Meister story each year.\u0027\n Graham gritted, \u0027Just one, and I\u0027ll henpeck him to death, and keep one unpublished story forever on hand, just in case. And you\u0027re publishing my novel, aren\u0027t you, Grew, old boy?\u0027\n \u0027Glug,\u0027 said MacDunlap.\n \u0027Aren\u0027t you?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, Graham. Of course, Graham. Definitely, Graham. Positively, Graham.\u0027\n Then leave us now. There are matters of importance I must discuss with my fiancee.\u0027\n MacDunlap smiled and tiptoed out the door.\n Ah, love, love, he mused, as he took a liver pill and followed it up by a cough-syrup chaser.\n I might make two points about \u0027Author! Author!\u0027 It seems to me that I was rather easier about handling romance in this story than in any previous one. Perhaps this is a reflection of the fact that it was the first story I ever wrote as a married man.\n Secondly, there are the very dated references to rationing, the draft, and other social phenomena much on the mind of anyone living through Worjd War II. I had warned Bensen of the existence of these references and of the inability of getting them out of the story by revision since they were integral to the plot. Bensen, however, shrugged them off and in his short introduction to the story said to.the readers, \u0027And don\u0027t worry about the references to the OP A and Selective Service - consider them as part of the historical setting, just as you would a bodkin or a furbelow in a story of an earlier time.\u0027\n And I second that statement here.\n Had I rested on the pink cloud of gratification that came with the sale of \u0027Author! Author!\u0027 for a few months, the death of Unknown might have disheartened me. It might have seemed to prove that I was not fated to reign ite my career after all, and perhaps - again - everything would have turned out differently.\n However, within three weeks of the sale I was at the typewriter again. The new story was \u0027Death Sentence\u0027 and it was science fiction. Writing was still slow work; seven weeks to do a 7,200-word story. On June 29, 1943, however, I sent it off to Campbell, and on July 8, it was accepted - one and a quarter cents per word again.\n This meant that when the news of Unknown\u0027s demise arrived, it was cushioned by the fact that I already had another story written and sold. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-early-asimov-volume-3/page-6.html","bookId":1748,"book":{"id":1748,"title":"The Early Asimov Volume 3","description":"Storyline: \n The Early Asimov Volume 3 (Panther Science Fiction) \n The Early Asimov or, Eleven Years of Trying is a 1972 collection of short stories by Isaac Asimov.
