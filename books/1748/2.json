{"id":70945,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"Author! Author! It occurred to Graham Dorn, and not for the first time, either, that there was one serious disadvantage in swearing you\u0027ll go through fire and water for a girl, however beloved. Sometimes she takes you at your miserable word. This is one way of saying that he had been waylaid, shanghaied and dragooned by his fiancee into speaking at her maiden aunt\u0027s Literary Society. Don\u0027t laugh! It\u0027s not funny from the speaker\u0027s rostrum. Some of the faces you have to look at! To race through the details, Graham Dorn had been jerked onto a platform and forced upright. He had read a speech on \u0027The Place of the Mystery Novel in American Literature\u0027 in an appalled tone. Not even the fact that his own eternally precious June had written it (part of the bribe to get him to speak in the first place) could mask the fact that it was essentially tripe. And then when he was weltering, figuratively speaking, in his own mental gore, the harpies closed in, for lo, it was time for the informal discussion and assorted feminine gush. - ...Oh, Mr. Dorn, do you work from inspiration? I mean, do you just sit down and then an idea strikes you - all at once? And you must sit up all night and drink black coffee to keep you awake till you get it down? - Oh, yes. Certainly. (His working hours were two to four in the afternoon every other day, and he drank milk.) - ...Oh, Mr. Dorn, you must do the most awful research to get all those bizarre murders. About how much must you do before you can write a story? - About six months, usually. (The only reference books he ever used were a six-volume encyclopedia and year-before-last\u0027s World Almanac.) - Oh, Mr. Dorn, did you make up your Reginald de Meister from a real character? You must have. He\u0027s oh, so convincing in his every detail. - He\u0027s modeled after a very dear boyhood chum of mine. (Dorn had never known anyone like de Meister, He lived in continual fear of meeting someone like him. He had even a cunningly fashioned ring containing a subtle Oriental poison for use just in case he did. So much for de Meister.) Somewhere past the knot of women, June Billings sat in her seat and smiled with sickening and proprietary pride. Graham passed a finger over his throat and went through the pantomime of choking to death as unobtrusively as possible. June smiled, nodded, threw him a delicate kiss, and did nothing. Graham decided to pass a stern, lonely, woman-less life and to have nothing but villainesses in his stories forever after. He was answering in monosyllables, alternating yesses and noes. Yes, he did take cocaine on occasion. He found it helped the creative urge. No, he didn\u0027t think he could allow Hollywood to take over de Meister. He thought movies weren\u0027t true expressions of real Art. Besides, they were just a passing fad. Yes. he would read Miss Cram\u0027s manuscripts if she brought them. Only too glad to. Reading amateur manuscripts was such fun, and editors are really such brutes. And then refreshments were announced, and there was a sudden vacuum. It took a split-second for Graham\u0027s head to clear. The mass of femininity had coalesced into a single specimen. She was four feet ten and about eighty-five pounds in weight. Graham was six-two and two hundred ten worth of brawn. He could probably have handled her without difficulty, especially since both her arms were occupied with a pachyderm of a purse. Still, he felt a little delicate, to say nothing of queasy, about knocking her down. It didn\u0027t seem quite the thing to do. She was advancing, with admiration and fervor disgustingly clear in her eyes, and Graham felt the wall behind him. There was no doorway within armreach on either side. \u0027Oh, Mr. de Meister - do, do please let me call you Mr. de Meister. Your creation is so real to me, that I can\u0027t think of you as simply Graham Dorn. You don\u0027t mind, do you?\u0027 \u0027No, no, of course not,\u0027 gargled Graham, as well as he could through thirty-two teeth simultaneously set on edge. \u0027I often think of myself as Reginald in my more frivolous moments.\u0027 \u0027Thank you. You can have no idea, dear Mr. de Meister, how I have looked forward to meeting you. I have read all your works, and I think they are wonderful.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m glad you think so.\u0027 He went automatically into the modesty routine. \u0027Really nothing, you know. Ha, ha, ha! Like to please the readers, but lots of room for improvement. Ha, ha, ha!\u0027 \u0027But you really are, you know.\u0027 This was said with intense earnestness. \u0027I mean good, really good. I think it is wonderful to be an author like you. It must be almost like being God.\u0027 Graham stared blankly. \u0027Not to editors, sister.\u0027 Sister didn\u0027t get the whisper. She continued, \u0027To be able to create living characters out of nothing; to unfold souls to all the world; to put thoughts into words; to build pictures and create worlds. I have often thought than an author was the most graciously gifted person in creation. Better an inspired author starving in a garret than a king upon his throne. Don\u0027t you think so?\u0027 \u0027Definitely,\u0027 lied Graham. \u0027What are the crass material goods of the world to the wonders of weaving emotions and deeds into a little world of its own?\u0027 \u0027What, indeed?\u0027 \u0027And posterity, think of posterity!\u0027 \u0027Yes, yes. I often do.\u0027 She seized his hand. There\u0027s only one little request. You might,\u0027 she blushed faintly, \u0027you might give poor Reginald - if you will allow me to call him that just once - a chance to marry Letitia Reynolds. You make her just a little too cruel to him. I\u0027m sure I weep over it for hours together sometimes. But then he is too, too real to me.\u0027 And from somewhere, a lacy frill of handkerchief made its appearance, and went to her eyes. She removed it, smiled bravely, and scurried away. Graham Dorn inhaled, closed his eyes, and gently collapsed into June\u0027s arms. His eyes opened with a jerk. \u0027You may consider,\u0027 he said severely, \u0027our engagement frazzled to the breaking point. Only my consideration for your poor, aged parents prevents your being known henceforward as the ex-fiancee of Graham Dorn.\u0027 \u0027Darling, you are so noble.\u0027 She massaged his sleeve with her cheeks. \u0027Come, I\u0027ll take you home and bathe your poor wounds.\u0027 \u0027All right, but you\u0027ll have to carry me. Has your precious, loveable aunt got an axe?\u0027 \u0027But why?\u0027 \u0027For one thing, she had the gall to introduce me as the brainfather, God help me, of the famous Reginald de Meister.\u0027 \u0027And aren\u0027t you?\u0027 \u0027Let\u0027s get out of this creep-joint. And get this. I\u0027m no relative by brain or otherwise, of that character. I disown him. I cast him into the darkness. I spit upon him. I declare him an illegitimate son, a foul degenerate, and the offspring of a hound, and I\u0027ll be damned if he ever pokes his lousy patrician nose into my typewriter again.\u0027 They were in the taxi, and June straightened his tie. \u0027All right, Sonny, let\u0027s see the letter.\u0027 \u0027What letter?\u0027 She held out her hand. \u0027The one from the publishers.\u0027 Graham snarled and flipped it out of his jacket pocket. \u0027I\u0027ve thought of inviting myself to his house for tea, the damned flintheart. He\u0027s got a rendezvous with a pinch of strychnine.\u0027 \u0027You may rave later. What does he say? Hmm - uh-huh -\"doesn\u0027t quite come up to what is expected - feel that de Meister isn\u0027t in his usual form - a little revision perhaps towards - feel sure the novel can be adjusted - are returning under separate cover-\"\u0027 She tossed it aside. \u0027I told you you shouldn\u0027t have killed off Sancha Rodriguez. She was what you needed. You\u0027re getting skimpy on the love interest.\u0027 \u0027You write it! I\u0027m through with de Meister. It\u0027s getting so club-women call me Mr. de Meister, and my picture is printed in newspapers with the caption Mr. de Meister. I have no individuality. No one ever heard of Graham Dorn. I\u0027m always: Dorn, Dorn, you know, the guy who writes the de Meister stuff, you know.\u0027 June squealed, \u0027Silly! You\u0027re jealous of your own detective.\u0027 \u0027I am not jealous of my own character. Listen! I hate detective stories. I never read them after I got into the two-syllable words. I wrote the first as a clever, trenchant, biting satire. It was to blast the entire false school of mystery writers. That\u0027s why I invented this de Meister. He was the detective to end all detectives. The Compleat Ass, by Graham Dorn. \u0027So the public, along with snakes, vipers and ungrateful children takes this filth to its bosom. I wrote mystery after mystery trying to convert the public -\u0027 Graham Dorn drooped a little at the futility of it all. \u0027Oh, well.\u0027 He smiled wanly, and the great soul rose above adversity. \u0027Don\u0027t you see? I\u0027ve got to write other things. I can\u0027t waste my life. But who\u0027s going to read a serious novel by Graham Dorn, now that I\u0027m so thoroughly identified with de Meister?\u0027 \u0027You can use a pseudonym.\u0027 \u0027I will not use a pseudonym. I\u0027m proud of my name.\u0027 \u0027But you can\u0027t drop de Meister. Be sensible, dear.\u0027 \u0027A normal fiancee,\u0027 Graham said bitterly, \u0027wou\u0027d want her future husband to write something really worthwhile and become a great name in literature.\u0027 \u0027Well, I do want you to, Graham. But just a little de Meister once in a while to pay the bills that accumulate.\u0027 \u0027Ha!\u0027 Graham knocked his hat over his eyes to hide the sufferings of a strong spirit in agony. \u0027Now you say that I can\u0027t reach prominence unless I prostitute my art to that unmentionable. Here\u0027s your place. Get out. I\u0027m going home and write a good scorching letter on asbestos to our senile Mr. MacDun-lap.\u0027 \u0027Do exactly as you want to, cookie,\u0027 soothed June. \u0027And tomorrow when you feel better, you\u0027ll come and cry on my shoulder, and we\u0027ll plan a revision of Death on the Third Deck together, shall we?\u0027 \u0027The engagement,\u0027 said Graham, loftily, \u0027is broken.\u0027 \u0027Yes, dear. I\u0027ll be home tomorrow at eight.\u0027 That is of no possible interest to me. Good-bye!\u0027 Publishers and editors are untouchables, of course. Theirs is a heritage of the outstretched hand and the well-toothed smile; the nod of the head and the slap of the back. But perhaps somewhere, in the privacy of the holes to which authors scurry when the night falls, a private revenge it taken. There, phrases may be uttered where no one can overhear, and letters may be written that need not be mailed, and perhaps a picture of an editor, smiling pensively, is enshrined above the typewriter to act the part of bulls-eye in an occasional game of darts. Such a picture of MacDunlap, so used, enlightened Graham Dorn\u0027s room. And Graham Dora himself, in his usual writing costume (street-clothes and typewriter), scowled at the fifth sheet of paper in his typewriter. The other four were draped over the edge of the waste-basket, condemned for their milk-and-watery mildness. He began: \u0027Dear Sir -\u0027 and added slowly and viciously, \u0027or Madam, as the case may be.\u0027 He typed furiously as the inspiration caught him, disregarding the faint wisp of smoke curling upward from the overheated keys: \u0027You say you don\u0027t think much of de Meister in this story. Well, I don\u0027t think much of de Meister, period. You can handcuff your slimy carcass to his and jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. And I hope they drain the East River just before you jump. \u0027From now on, my works will be aimed higher than your scurvy press. And the day will come when I can look back on this period of my career with the loathing that is its just -\u0027 Someone had been tapping Graham on the shoulder during the last paragraph. Graham twitched it angrily and ineffectively at intervals. Now he stopped, turned around, and addressed the stranger in his room courteously: \u0027Who the devilish damnation are you? And you can leave without bothering to answer. I won\u0027t think you rude.\u0027 The newcomer smiled graciously. His nod wafted the delicate aroma of some unobtrusive hair-oil toward Graham. His lean, hard-bitten jaw stood out keenly, and he said in a well-modulated voice: \u0027De Meister is the name. Reginald de Meister.\u0027 Graham rocked to his mental foundations and heard them creak. \u0027Glub,\u0027 he said. \u0027Pardon?\u0027 Graham recovered. \u0027I said, \"glub,\" a little code word meaning which de Meister.\u0027 \u0027The de Meister,\u0027 explained de Meister, kindly. \u0027My character?- My detective?\u0027 De Meister helped himself to a seat, and his finely-chiseled features assumed that air of well-bred boredom so admired in the best circles. He lit a Turkish cigarette, which Graham at once recognized as his detective\u0027s favorite brand, tapping it slowly and carefully against the back of his hand first, a mannerism equally characteristic. \u0027Really, old man,\u0027 said de Meister. \u0027This is really excruciat-inly funny. I suppose I am your character, y\u0027know, but let\u0027s not work on that basis. It would be so devastatin\u0027ly awkward.\u0027 \u0027Glub,\u0027 said Graham again, by way of a rejoinder. His mind was feverishly setting up alternatives. He didn\u0027t drink, more, at the moment, was the pity, so he wasn\u0027t drunk. He had a chrome-steel digestion and he wasn\u0027t overheated, so it wasn\u0027t a hallucination. He never dreamed, and his imagination - as befitted a paying commodity - was under strict control. And since, like all authors, he was widely considered more than half a screwball, insanity was out of the question. Which left de Meister simply an impossibility, and Graham felt relieved. It\u0027s a very poor author indeed who hasn\u0027t learned the fine art of ignoring impossibilities in writing a book. He said smoothly, \u0027I have here a volume of my latest work. Do you mind naming your page and crawling back into it. I\u0027m a busy man and God knows I have enough of you in the tripe I write.\u0027 \u0027But I\u0027m here on business, old chap. I\u0027ve got to come to a friendly arrangement with you first. Things are deucedly uncomfortable as they are.\u0027 \u0027Look, do you know you\u0027re bothering me? I\u0027m not in the habit of talking to mythical characters. As a general thing, I don\u0027t pal around with them. Beside which, it\u0027s time your mother told you that you really don\u0027t exist.\u0027 \u0027My dear fellow, I always existed. Existence is such a subjective thing. What a mind thinks exists, does exist. I existed in your mind, for instance, ever since you first thought of me.\u0027 Graham shuddered. \u0027But the question is, what are you doing out of my mind? Getting a little narrow for you? Want elbow room?\u0027 \u0027Not at all. Rather satisfact\u0027ry mind in its way, but I achieved a more concrete existence only this afternoon, and so I seize the opportunity to engage you face to face in the aforementioned business conversation. You see, that thin, sentimental lady of your society -\u0027 \u0027What society?\u0027 questioned Graham hollowly. It was all awfully clear to him now. \u0027The one at which you made a speech\u0027 - de Meister shuddered in his turn - \u0027on the detective novel. She believed in my existence, so naturally, I exist.\u0027 He finished his cigarette and flicked it out with a negligent twist of the wrist. \u0027The logic,\u0027 declared Graham, \u0027is inescapable. Now, what do you want and the answer is no.\u0027 \u0027Do you realize, old man, that if you stop writing de Meister stories, my existence will become that dull, wraithlike one of all superannuated fictional detectives. I\u0027d have to gibber through the gray mists of Limbo with Holmes, Lecocoq and Dupin.\u0027 \u0027A very fascinating thought, I think. A very fitting fate.\u0027 Reginald de Meister\u0027s eyes turned icy, and Graham suddenly remembered the passage on page 123 of The Case of the Broken Ashtray: His eyes, hitherto lazy and unattentive, hardened into twin pools of blue ice and transfixed the butler, who staggered back, a stifled cry on his lips, Evidently, de Meister lost none of his characteristics out of the novels he adorned. Graham staggered back, a stifled cry on his lips.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-early-asimov-volume-3/page-2.html","bookId":1748,"book":{"id":1748,"title":"The Early Asimov Volume 3","description":"Storyline: The Early Asimov Volume 3 (Panther Science Fiction) The Early Asimov or, Eleven Years of Trying is a 1972 collection of short stories by Isaac Asimov.
