They retreated slowly, backing away, with the drinking tube flicking in and out, before receding finally into a pink, wrinkled mass above a wide, lipless mouth. They went to sleep in groups in the shaded angles, plump and sated. \u0027Animals!\u0027 said Zammo, with contempt. \u0027How often do they drink?\u0027 asked Antyok. \u0027As often as they want. They can go a week if they have to. We water them every day. They store it under their skin. They eat in the evenings. Vegetarians, you know.\u0027 Antyok smiled chubbily, \u0027It\u0027s nice to get a bit of firsthand information occasionally. Can\u0027t read reports all the time.\u0027 \u0027Yes?\u0027 - noncommittally. Then, \u0027What\u0027s new? What about the lacy-pants boys on Trantor?\u0027 Antyok shrugged dubiously, \"You can\u0027t get the Bureau to commit itself, unfortunately. With the Emperor sympathetic to the Aurelionists, humanitarianism is the order of the day. You know that.\u0027 There was a pause in which the administrator chewed his lip uncertainly. \u0027But there\u0027s this birth-rate problem now. It\u0027s finally been assigned to AdHQ, you know - and double A priority, too.\u0027 Zammo muttered wordlessly. Antyok said, \u0027You may not realize it, but that project will now take precedence over all other work proceeding on Ceph-eus 18. It\u0027s important.\u0027 He turned back to the viewing window and said thoughtfully with a bald lack of preamble. \u0027Do you think those creatures might be unhappy?\u0027 \u0027Unhappy!\u0027 The word was an explosion. \u0027Well, then,\u0027 Antyok corrected hastily, \u0027maladjusted. You understand? It\u0027s difficult to adjust an environment to a race we know so little of.\u0027 \u0027Say - did you ever see the world we took them from?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve read the reports-\u0027 \u0027Reports!\u0027 - infinite contempt. \u0027I\u0027ve seen it. This may look like desert out there to you, but it\u0027s a watery paradise to those devils. They have all the food and water they can get. They have a world to themselves with vegetation and natural water flow, instead of a lump of silica and granite where fungi were force-grown in caves and water had to be steamed out of gypsum rock. In ten years, they would have been dead to the last beast, and we saved them. Unhappy? Ga-a-ah, if they are, they haven\u0027t the decency of most animals.\u0027 \u0027Well, perhaps. Yet I have a notion.\u0027 \u0027A notion? What is your notion?\u0027 Zammo reached for one of his cigars. \u0027It\u0027s something that might help you. Why not study the creatures in a more integrated fashion? Let them use their initiative. After all, they did have a highly-developed science. Your reports speak of it continually. Give them problems to solve.\u0027 \u0027Such as?\u0027 \u0027Oh... oh,\u0027 Antyok waved his hands helplessly. \u0027Whatever you think might help most. For instance, spaceships. Get them into the control room and study their reactions.\u0027 \u0027Why?\u0027 asked Zammo with dry bluntness. \u0027Because the reaction of their minds to tools and controls adjusted to the human temperament can teach you a lot. In addition, it will make a more effective bribe, it seems to me, than anything you\u0027ve yet tried. You\u0027ll get more volunteers if they think they\u0027ll be doing something interesting.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s your psychology coming out. Hm-m-m. Sounds better than it probably is. I\u0027ll sleep on it. And where would I get permission, in any case, to let them handle spaceships? I\u0027ve none at my disposal, and it would take a good deal longer than it was worth to follow down the line of red tape to get one assigned to us.\u0027 Antyok pondered, and his forehead creased lightly, \u0027It doesn\u0027t have to be spaceships. But even so - If you would write up another report and make the suggestion yourself - strongly, you understand - I might figure out some way of tying it up with my birth-rate project. A double-A priority can get practically anything, you know, without questions.\u0027 Zammo\u0027s interest lacked a bit even of mildness, \u0027Well, maybe. Meanwhile, I\u0027ve some basal metabolism tests in progress, and it\u0027s getting late. I\u0027ll think about it. It\u0027s got its points.\u0027 From: AdHQ-Cephl8 To: BuOuProv Subject: Outer Province Project 2910, Part I - Birth rate of non-Humans on Cepheus 18, Investigation of, Reference: (a) BuOuProv letr.

Enclosure 1 is forwarded herewith for the information of the BuOuProv. 2. Special attention is directed to Section V, Paragraph 3 of Enclosure 1 in which it is requested that a spaceship be as signed SciGroup 10 for use in expediting investigations author ized by the BuOuProv. It is considered by AdHQ-Ceph18 that such investigations may be of material use in aiding work now in progress on the subject project, authorized by reference (a). It is suggested, in view of the high priority placed by the BuOu Prov upon the subject project, that immediate consideration be given the SciGroup\u0027s request. L. Antyok, Superv.

It is urgently requested that work on the subject project be expedited by all available means. C. Morily, Head, BuOuProv, 251/977G.E. IV The little, bricky creature must have been more uncomfortable than his bearing would admit to. He was carefully wrapped in a temperature already adjusted to the point where his human companions steamed in their open shirts. His speech was high-pitched and careful, \u0027I find it damp, but not unbearably so at this low temperature.\u0027 Antyok smiled, \u0027It was nice of you to come. I had planned to visit you. but a trial run in yoUr atmosphere out there-\u0027 The smile had become rueful. \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter. You other worldlings have done more for us than ever we were able to do for ourselves. It is an obligation that is but imperfectly returned by the endurance on my part of a trifling discomfort.\u0027 His speech seemed always indirect, as if he approached his thoughts sidelong, or as if it were against all etiquette to be blunt. Gustiv Bannerd, seated in an angle of the room, with one long leg crossing the other, scrawled nimbly and said, \u0027You don\u0027t mind if I record all this?\u0027 The Cepheid non-Human glanced briefly at the journalist, \u0027I have no objection.\u0027 Antyok\u0027s apologetics persisted. This is not a purely social affair, sir. I would not have forced discomfort on you for that. There are important questions to be considered, and you are the leader of your people.\u0027 The Cepheid nodded, \u0027I am satisfied your purposes are kindly. Please proceed.\u0027 The administrator almost wriggled in his difficulty in putting thoughts into words. \u0027It is a subject,\u0027 he said, \u0027of delicacy, and one I wou\u0027d never bring up if it weren\u0027t for the overwhelming importance of the... uh... question. I am only the spokesman of my government-\u0027 \u0027My people consider the otherworld government a kindly one.\u0027 \u0027Well, yes, they are kindly. For that reason, they are disturbed over the fact that your people no longer breed.\u0027 Antyok paused, and waited with worry for a reaction that did not come. The Cepheid\u0027s face was motionless except for the soft, trembling motion of the wrinkled area that was Ms deflated drinking tube. Antyok continued, \u0027It is a question we have hesitated to bring up because of its extremely personal angles. Noninterference is my government\u0027s prime aim, and we have done our best to investigate the problem quietly and without disturbing your people. But, frankly, we -\u0027 \u0027Have failed?\u0027 finished the Cepheid, at the other\u0027s pause. \u0027Yes. Or at least, we have not discovered a concrete failure to reproduce the exact environment of your original world; with, of course, the necessary modification to make it more livable. Naturally, it is thought there is some chemical shortcoming. And so I ask your voluntary help in the matter. Your people are advanced in the study of your own biochemistry. If you do not choose, or would rather not -\u0027 \u0027No, no, I can help.\u0027 The Cepheid seemed cheerful about it. The smooth flat planes of his loose-skinned, hairless skull wrinkled in an alien response to an uncertain emotion. \u0027It is not a matter that any of us would have thought would have disturbed you other-worldlings. That it does is but another indication of your well-meaning kindness. This wor\u0027d we find congenial, a paradise in comparison to our o!d. It lacks in nothing. Conditions such as now prevail belong in our legends of the Golden Age.\u0027 \u0027Well-\u0027 \u0027But there is a something; a something you may not understand. We cannot expect different intelligences to think alike.\u0027 \u0027I shall try to understand.\u0027 The Cepheid\u0027s voice had grown soft, its liquid undertones more pronounced, \u0027We were dying on our native world; but we were fighting. Our science, developed through a history older than yours, was losing; but it had not yet lost. Perhans it was because our science was fundamentally biological. rather than physical as yours is. Your people discovered new forms of energy and reached the stars. Our people d:scovered new truths of psychology and psychiatry and built up a working society free of disease and crime. \u0027There is no need to question which of the two angles of approach was the more laudable, but there is no uncertainty as to which proved more successful in the end. In our dying world, without the means of life or sources of power, our biological science could but make the dying easier. \u0027And yet we fought. For centuries past, we had been groping toward the elements of atomic power, and slowly the spark of hope had glimmered that we might break through the two-dimensional limits of our planetary surface and reach the stars. There were no other planets in our system to serve as stepping stones. Nothing but some twenty light-years to the nearest star, without the knowledge of the possibility of the existence of other planetary systems, but rather of the contrary. \u0027But there is something in all life that insists on striving; even on useless striving. There were only five thousand of us left in the last days. Only five thousand. And our first ship was ready. It was experimental. It would probably have been a failure. But already we had all the principles of propulsion and navigation correctly worked out.\u0027 There was a long pause, and the Cepheid\u0027s small black eyes seemed glazed in retrospect. The newspaperman put in suddenly, from his corner, \u0027And then we came?\u0027 \u0027And then you came,\u0027 the Cepheid agreed simply. \u0027It changed everything. Energy was ours for the asking. A new world, congenial and, indeed, ideal, was ours even without asking. If our problems of society had long been solved by ourselves, our more difficult problems of environment were suddenly solved for us, no less completely.\u0027 \u0027Well?\u0027 urged Antyok. \u0027Well - it was somehow not well. For centuries, our ancestors had fought toward the stars, and now the stars suddenly proved to be the property of others. We had fought for life, and it had become a present handed to us by others. There is no longer any reason to fight. There is no longer anything to attain. All the universe is the property of your race.\u0027 \u0027This world is yours,\u0027 said Antyok, gently. \u0027By sufferance. It is a gift. It is not ours by right\u0027 \u0027You have earned it, in my opinion.\u0027 And now the Cepheid\u0027s eyes were sharply fixed on the other\u0027s countenance, \u0027You mean well, but I doubt that you understand. We have nowhere to go, save this gift of a world. We are in a blind alley. The function of life is striving, and that is taken from us. Life can no longer interest us. We have no offspring - voluntarily. It is our way of removing ourselves from your way.\u0027 Absent-mindedly, Antyok had removed the fluoro-globe from the window seat, and spun it on its base. Its gaudy surface reflected light as it spun, and its three-foot-high bulk floated with incongruous grace and lightness in the air. Antyok said, \u0027Is that your only solution? Sterility?\u0027 \u0027We might escape still,\u0027 whispered the Cepheid, \u0027but where in the Galaxy is there place for us? It is all yours.\u0027 \u0027Yes, there is no place for you nearer than the Magellame Clouds if you wished independence. The Magellanic Clouds -\u0027 \u0027And you would not let us go of yourselves. You mean kindly, I know.\u0027 \u0027Yes, we mean kindly - but we could not let you go.\u0027 \u0027It is a mistaken kindness.\u0027 \u0027Perhaps, but could you not reconcile yourselves? You have a world.\u0027 \u0027It is something past complete explanations. Your mind is different. We could not reconcile ourselves. I believe, administrator, that you have thought of all this before. The concept of the blind alley we find ourselves trapped in is not new to you.\u0027 Antyok looked up, startled, and one hand steadied the fluoro-globe, \u0027Can you read my mind?\u0027 \u0027It is just a guess. A good one, I think.\u0027 \u0027Yes - but can you read my mind? The minds of humans in general, I mean. It is an interesting point. The scientists say you cannot, but sometimes I wonder if it is that you simply will not. Could you answer that? I am detaining you, unduly, perhaps.\u0027 \u0027No... no -\u0027 But the little Cepheid drew his enveloping robe closer, and buried his face in the electrically-heated pad at the collar for a moment. \u0027You other-worldlings speak of reading minds. It is not so at all, but it is assuredly hopeless to explain.\u0027 Antyok mumbled the old proverb, \u0027One cannot explain sight to a man blind from birth.\u0027 \u0027Yes, just so. This sense which you call \"mind reading,\" quite erroneously, cannot be applied to us. It is not that we cannot receive the proper sensations, it is that your people do not transmit them, and we have no way of explaining to you how to go about it.\u0027 \u0027Hm-m-m.\u0027 \u0027There are times, of course, of great concentration or emotional tension on the part of an other-worldling when some of us who are more expert in this sense; more sharp-eyed, so to speak; detect vaguely something. It is uncertain; yet I myself have at times wondered -\u0027 Carefully, Antyok began spinning the fluoro-globe once more. His pink face was set in thought, and his eyes were fixed upon the Cepheid. Gustiv Bannerd stretched his fingers and reread his notes, his lips moving silently. The fluoro-globe spun, and slowly the Cepheid seemed to grow tense as well, as his eyes shifted to the colorful sheen of the globe\u0027s fragile surface. The Cepheid said, \u0027What is that?\u0027 Antyok started, and his face smoothed into an almost chuckling placidity, \u0027This? A Galactic fad of three years ago; which means that it is a hopelessly old-fashioned relic this year. It is a useless device but it looks pretty. Bannerd, could you adjust the windows to non-transmission?\u0027 There was the soft click of a contact, and the windows became curved regions of darkness, while in the center of the room, the fluoro-globe was suddenly the focus of a rosy effulgence that seemed to leap outward in streamers. Antyok, a scarlet figure in a scarlet room, placed it upon the table and spun it with a hand that dripped red. As it spun, the colors changed with a slowly increasing rapidity, blended and fell apart into more extreme contrasts. Antyok was speaking in an eerie atmosphere of molten, shifting rainbow, \u0027The surface is of a material that exhibits variable fluorescence. It is almost weightless, extremely fragile, but gyroscopically balanced so that it rarely falls, with ordinary care. It is rather pretty, don\u0027t you think?\u0027 From somewhere the Cepheid\u0027s voice came, \u0027Extremely pretty.\u0027 \u0027But it has outworn its welcome; outlived its fashionable existence.\u0027 The Cepheid\u0027s voice was abstracted, \u0027It is very pretty.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-early-asimov-volume-3/page-11.html","bookId":1748,"book":{"id":1748,"title":"The Early Asimov Volume 3","description":"Storyline: The Early Asimov Volume 3 (Panther Science Fiction) The Early Asimov or, Eleven Years of Trying is a 1972 collection of short stories by Isaac Asimov.
