{"id":70953,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"Antyok\u0027s little mouth pursed itself. \u0027But - Pardon me, doctor, but I don\u0027t follow you. How are you prevented? Surely the Civil Administration has made no attempt to hamper scientific investigation of these non-Humans. I cannot speak for my predecessor entirely, of course, but I myself -\u0027\n \u0027No direct interference has occurred. I don\u0027t speak of that. But by the Galaxy, administrator, we\u0027re hampered by the spirit of the entire set-up. You\u0027re making us deal with humans. You allow them their own leader and internal autonomy. You pamper them and give them what Aurelion\u0027s philosophy would call \"rights.\" I can\u0027t deal with their leader.\u0027\n \u0027Why not?\u0027\n \u0027Because he refuses to allow me a free hand. He refuses to allow experiments on any subject without the subject\u0027s own consent. The two or three volunteers we get are not too bright. It\u0027s an impossible arrangement.\u0027\n Antyok shrugged helplessly.\n Zammo continued, \u0027In addition, it is obviously impossible to learn anything of value concerning the brains, physiology and chemistry of these animals without dissection, dietary experiments and drugs. You know, administrator, scientific investigation is a hard game. Humanity hasn\u0027t much place in it.\u0027\n Loodun Antyok tapped his chin with a doubtful finger, \u0027Must it be quite so-hard? These are harmless creatures, these non-Humans. Surely, dissection - Perhaps, if you were to approach them a bit differently - I have the idea that you antagonize them. Your attitude might be somewhat overbearing.\u0027\n \u0027Overbearing! I am not one of these whining social psychologists who are all the fad these days. I don\u0027t believe you can solve a problem that requires dissection by approaching it with what is called the \"correct personal attitude\" in the cant of the times.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry you think so. Sociopsychological training is required of all administrators above the grade of A-4.\u0027\n Zammo withdrew his cud of a cigar from his mouth and replaced it after a suitably contemptuous interval. \u0027Then you\u0027d better use a bit of your technique on the Bureau. You know, I do have friends at the Imperial Court.\u0027\n \u0027Well, now, I can\u0027t take the matter up with them, not baldly. Basic policy does not fall within my cognizance, and such things can only be initiated by the Bureau. But, you know, we might try an indirect approach on this.\u0027 He smiled faintly, \u0027Strategy.\u0027\n \u0027What sort?\u0027\n Antyok pointed a sudden finger, while his other hand fell lightly on the rows of gray-bound reports upon the floor just next his chair, \u0027Now, look, I\u0027ve gone through most of these. They\u0027re dull, but contain some facts. For instance, when was the last non-Human infant born on Cepheus 18?\u0027\n Zammo spent little time in consideration. \u0027Don\u0027t know. Don\u0027t care either.\u0027\n \u0027But the Bureau would. There\u0027s never been a non-Human infant born on Cepheus 18 - not in the two years the world has been established. Do you know the reason?\u0027\n The physiologist shrugged, \u0027Too many possible factors. It would take study.\u0027\n \u0027All right, then. Suppose you write a report -\u0027\n \u0027Reports! I\u0027ve written twenty.\u0027\n \u0027Write another. Stress the unsolved problems. Tell them you must change your methods. Harp on the birth-rate problem. The Bureau doesn\u0027t dare ignore that. If the non-Humans die out, someone will have to answer to the Emperor. You see -\u0027\n Zammo stared, his eyes dark, \u0027That will swing it?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve been working for the Bureau for twenty-seven years. I know its ways.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll think about it.\u0027 Zammo rose and stalked out of the office. The door slammed behind him.\n It was later that Zammo said to a co-worker, \u0027He\u0027s a bureaucrat, in the first place. He won\u0027t abandon the orthodoxies of paper work and he won\u0027t risk sticking his neck out. He\u0027ll accomplish little by himself, yet maybe more than a little if we work through him.\u0027\n From: Administrative Headquarters, Cepheus 18\n To: BuOuProv\n Subject: Outer Province Project 2563, Part TT - Scientific Investigations of non-Humans of Cepheus 18, Co-ordination of,\n References:\n (a)...BuOuProv letr.

Enclosure 1, included herewith, is forwarded for the in formation of the BuOuProv. It is to be noted that Section XII, paragraphs 1-16 of Encl. 1, concern possible changes in pre sent BuOuProv policy with regard to non-Humans with a view to facilitating physical and chemical investigations at present proceeding under authorization of reference (a)\n It is brought to the attention of the BuOuProv that refer ence (b) has already discussed possible changes in investigating methods and that it remains the opinion of AdHQ-Cephl8 that such changes are as yet premature. It is nevertheless suggested that the question of non-Human birth rate be made the subject of a BuOuProv project assigned to AdHQ-Cephl8 in view of the importance attached by SciGroup 10 to the problem, as evidenced in Section V of Enclosure 1.\n L. Antyok, Superv.\n AdHQ-CephlS, 174/977\n From: BuOuProv\n To: AdHQ-CephlS\n Subject: Outer Province Project 2563 - Scientific Investigations of non-Humans of Cepheus 18, Co-ordination of, Reference: (a) AdHQ-CephlS letr. AA-LA/mn, dated 174/977 G.E.\n 1. In response to the suggestion contained in paragraph 2 of reference (a), it is considered that the question of the non- Human birth rate does not fall within the cognizance of AdHQ- Ceph 18. In view of the fact that SciGroup 10 has reported said sterility to be probably due to a chemical deficiency in the food supply, all investigations in the field are relegated to Sci Group 10 as the proper authority.\n 2. Investigating procedures by the various SciGroups shall continue according to current directives on the subject. No changes in policy are envisaged.\n C. Morily, Chief,\n BuOuProv, 186/977 G.E.\n II\n There was a loose-jointed gauntness about the news reporter which made him appear somberly tall. He was Gustiv Ban-nerd, with whose reputation was combined ability - two things which do not invariably go together despite the maxims of elementary morality.\n Loodum Antyok took his measure doubtfully and said, \u0027There\u0027s no use denying that you\u0027re right. But the Sci-Group report was confidential. I don\u0027t understand how -\u0027 \u0027It leaked,\u0027 said Bannerd, callously. \u0027Everything leaks.\u0027 Antyok was obviously baffled, and his pink face furrowed slightly, Then I\u0027ll just have to plug the leak here. I can\u0027t pass your story. All references to SciGroup complaints have to come out. You see that, don\u0027t you?\u0027\n \u0027No.\u0027 Bannerd was calm enough. \u0027It\u0027s important; and I have my rights under the Imperial directive. I think the Empire should know what\u0027s going on.\u0027\n \u0027But it isn\u0027t going on,\u0027 said Antyok, despairingly. \u0027Your claims are all wrong. The bureau isn\u0027t going to change its policy. I showed you the letters.\u0027\n \u0027You think you can stand up against Zammo when he puts the pressure on?\u0027 the newsman asked derisively.\n \u0027I will - if I think he\u0027s wrong.\u0027\n \u0027If!\u0027 stated Bannerd flatly. Then, in a sudden fervor, \u0027Antyok, the Empire has something great here; something greater by a good deal than the government apparently realizes. They\u0027re destroying it. They\u0027re treating these creatures like animals.\u0027\n \u0027Really-\u0027 began Antyok, weakly.\n \u0027Don\u0027t talk about Cepheus 18. It\u0027s a zoo. It\u0027s a high-class zoo, with your petrified scientists teasing those poor creatures with their sticks poking through the bars. You throw them chunks of meat, but you cage them up. I know! I\u0027ve been writing about them for two years now. I\u0027ve almost been living with them.\u0027\n \u0027Zammo says -\u0027\n \u0027Zammo!\u0027 This with hard contempt.\n \u0027Zammo says,\u0027 insisted Antyok with worried firmness, \u0027that we treat them too like humans as it is.\u0027\n The newsman\u0027s straight, long cheeks were rigid, \u0027Zammo is rather animallike in his own right. He is a science-worshiper. We can do with less of them. Have you read Aureh\u0027on\u0027s works?\u0027 The last was suddenly posed.\n \u0027Umm. Yes. I understand the Emperor -\u0027\n \u0027The Emperor tends towards us. That is good - better than the hounding of the last reign.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t see where you\u0027re heading?\u0027\n These aliens have much to teach us. You understand? It is nothing that Zammo and his Sci-Group can use; no chemistry, no telepathy. It\u0027s a way of life; a way of thinking. The aliens have no crime, no misfits. What effort is being made to study their philosophy? Or to set them up as a problem in social engineering?\u0027\n Antyok grew thoughtful, and his plump face smoothed out, \u0027It is an interesting consideration. It would be a matter for psychologists -\u0027\n \u0027No good. Most of them are quacks. Psychologists point out problems, but their solutions are fallacious. We need men of Aurelion. Men of the Philosophy -\u0027\n \u0027But look here, we can\u0027t turn Cepheus 18 into... into a metaphysical study.\u0027\n \u0027Why not? It can be done easily.\u0027\n \u0027How?\u0027\n \u0027Forget your puny test-tube peerings. Allow the aliens to set up a society free of Humans. Give them an untrammeled independence and allow an intermingling of philosophies -\u0027\n Antyok\u0027s nervous response came,\u0027That can\u0027t be done in a day.\u0027\n \u0027We can start in a day.\u0027\n The administrator said slowly, \u0027Well, I can\u0027t prevent you from trying to start.\u0027 He grew confidential, his mild eyes thoughtful, \u0027You\u0027ll ruin your own game, though, if you publish SciGroup 10\u0027s report and denounce it on humanitarian grounds. The Scientists are powerful.\u0027\n \u0027And we of The Philosophy as well.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but there\u0027s an easy way. You needn\u0027t rave. Simply point out that the SciGroup is not solving its problems. Do so unemotionally and let the readers think out your point of view for -themselves. Take the birth-rate problem, for instance. There\u0027s something for you. In a generation, the non-Humans might die out, for all science can do. Point out that a more philosophical approach is required. Or pick some other obvious point. Use your judgment, eh?\u0027\n Antyok smiled ingratiatingly as he arose, \u0027But, for the Galaxy\u0027s sake, don\u0027t stir up a bad smell.\u0027\n Bannerd was stiff and unresponsive, \u0027You may be right.\u0027\n It was later that Bannerd wrote in a capsule message to a friend, \u0027He is not clever, by any means. He is confused and has no guiding-line through life. Certainly utterly incompetent in his job. But he\u0027s a cutter and a trimmer, compromises his way around difficulties, and will yield concessions rather than risk a hard stand. He may prove valuable in that.

It is proposed to investigate the causes and the means of precluding the unfavorable birth-rate phenomena mentioned in references (a) and (b). A project is therefore set up, entitled, \u0027Birth rate of non-Humans on Cepheus 18, Investigation of* to which, in view of the crucial importance of the subject, a priority of AA is given.\n 2. The number assigned to the subject project is 2910, and all expenses incidental to it shall be assigned to Appropriation number 18/78.\n C, Morily, Chief,\n BuOuProY, 223/977 G.E.\n III\n If Tomor Zammo\u0027s ill-humor lessened within the grounds of SciGroup 10 Experimental Station, his friendliness had not thereby increased. Antyok found himself standing alone at the viewing window into the main field laboratory.\n The main field laboratory was a broad court set at the environmental conditions of Cepheus 18 itself for the discomfort of the experimenters and the convenience of the experimem-tees. Through the burning sand, and the dry, oxygen-rich air, there sparkled the hard brilliance of hot, white sunlight. And under the blaze, the brick-red non-Humans, wrinkled of skin and wiry of build, huddled in their squatting positions of ease, by ones and twos.\n Zammo emerged from the laboratory. He paused to drink water thirstily. He looked up, moisture gleaming on his upper lip, \u0027Like to step in there?\u0027\n Antyok shook his head definitely, \u0027No, thank you. What\u0027s the temperature right now?\u0027\n \u0027A hundred twenty, if there were shade. And they complain of the cold. It\u0027s drinking time now. Want to watch them drink?\u0027\n A spray of water shot upward from the fountain in the center of the court, and the little alien figures swayed to their feet and hopped eagerly forward in a queer, springy half-run. They milled about the water, jostling one another. The centers of their faces were suddenly disfigured by the projection of a long and flexible fleshy tube, which thrust forward into the spray and was withdrawn dripping. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-early-asimov-volume-3/page-10.html","bookId":1748,"book":{"id":1748,"title":"The Early Asimov Volume 3","description":"Storyline: \n The Early Asimov Volume 3 (Panther Science Fiction) \n The Early Asimov or, Eleven Years of Trying is a 1972 collection of short stories by Isaac Asimov.
