I got up, or rather got down, from my berth, and casting a bucket over the schooner\u0027s side soon made a sea-water toilet. I forgot to mention the sleeping arrangements of the \"Balaklava.\" There were two lower berths on one side[Pg 78] the cabin, either of which was large enough for two persons; and two single upper berths on the other side, neither of which was large enough for one person. At the proper hour for retiring, the captain\u0027s lady shut the cabin-door to keep out intruders, deliberately arrayed herself in dimity, turned in with baby in one of the large berths, and re?pened the door. There she lay, wide awake, with her bright eyes twinkling within the folds of her night cap, unaffected, chatty, and agreeable; then the captain divested himself of boots and pea-jacket and turned in beside his lady (the mate slept, when off his watch, in the other double berth). Picton rolled himself up in his blanket and stretched out on his locker; I climbed into the narrow coop, over the salt beef and hard biscuit department; and so we dozed and talked until sleep reigned over all. In the morning the ceremonies were reversed, with the exception of the Captain, who was up first. \"I never see a man sleep so little as the captain,\" said Bruce; \"about two hoors, an\u0027 that\u0027s aw.\" \n \n The sun was already risen when I came out on the deck of the \"Balaklava;\" but where was the sun? Indeed, where was the ocean, or anything? The schooner was barely making steerage-way, with a light head-wind, over a small patch of water,[Pg 79] not much larger apparently than the schooner herself. The air was filled with a luminous haze that appeared to be penetrable by the eye, and yet was not; that seemed at once open and dense; near yet afar off; close yet diffuse; contracted yet boundless. There was no light nor shade, no outline, distance, a?rial perspective. There was no east and west, nor blushing Aurora, rising from old Tithonus\u0027 bed; nor blue sky, nor green sea, nor ship, nor shore, nor color, tint, hue, ray, or reflection. There was nothing visible except the sides of the vessel, a maze of dripping rigging, two sailors bristling with drops, and the captain in a shiny sou-wester. The feeling of seclusion and security was complete, although we might have been run down by another vessel at any moment; the air was deliciously bland, invigorating, and pregnant with life; to breathe it was a transport; you felt it in every globule of blood, in every pore of the lungs. I could have hugged that fog, I was so happy! \n \n Up and down the rolling deck I marched, and with every inspiration of the moist air, felt the old, tiresome, lingering sickness floating away. Then I was startled with a new sensation, I began to get hungry! \n \n It was between four and five o\u0027clock in the morning, and the \"Balaklava\" did not breakfast until[Pg 80] eight. Reader, were you ever hungry at sea? Were you ever on deck, upon the measureless ocean, four hours earlier than the ring of the breakfast-bell? Were you ever awake on the briny deep, in advance, when the cook had yet two hours to sleep; when the stove in the galley was cold, and the kindling-wood unsplit; the coffee still in its tender, green, unroasted innocence? Were you ever upon \"the blue, the fresh, the ever free,\" under these circumstances? If so, I need not say to you that the sentiment, then and there awakened, is stronger than avarice, pride, ambition or, love. \n \n Presently Picton burst out like a flower on deck, in a mass of over-coats, with an India-rubber mackintosh by way of calyx. These were his night-clothes. Picton could do nothing except in full costume; he could not fish, in ever so small a stream, without being booted to the hips; nor shoot, in ever so good a cover, without being jacketed above the hips. He shaved himself in front of a silver-mounted dressing-case, wrote his letters on a portable secretary, drew off his boots with a patent boot-jack, brewed his punch with a peripatetic kettle, and in fact carried a little London with him in every quarter of the globe. \"Well,\" said Picton, looking around at the fog with a low and expressive whistle, \"this is serene!\"[Pg 81] \n \n Although Picton used the word \"serene\" ironically, just as a man riding in an omnibus and suddenly discovering that he was destitute of the needful sixpence might exclaim, \"This is pleasant,\" yet the phrase was not out of place. The \"Balaklava\" was gliding lazily over the water, at the rate of three knots an hour, sometimes giving a little lurch by way of shaking the wet out of her invisible sails, for the fog obscured all her upper canvas, and the mind and body easily yielded to the lullaby movement of the vessel. Talk of lotus-eating; of Castles of Indolence; of the dreamy ether inhaled from amber-tubed narghilé; of poppy and mandragora, and all the drowsy syrups of the world; of rain upon the midnight roof; the cooing of doves, the hush of falling snow, the murmur of brooks, the long summer song of grasshoppers in the field, the tinkling of fountains, and everything else that can soothe, lull, or tranquillize; and what are these to the serenity of this sail-swinging, ripple-stirring, gently-creaking craft, in her veil of luminous vapor? \"How delightful this is!\" said I. \n \n The traveller eyed me with surprise, but at last comprehending the idea, admitted, that with the exception of the fog and the calm, the scarcity of news, the damp state of the decks, and the want of the morning papers, it was very charming indeed.[Pg 82] Then the traveller got a little restive, and began to peer closely into the fog, and look aloft to see if he could make out the stay-sails, and then he entered into a long confidential talk with the captain, in relation to the chances of \"getting on,\" of a fresh breeze springing up, and the fog lifting; whether we should make Louisburgh by to-morrow night, and if not, when; with various other salt-water speculations and problems. Then Picton climbed up on the patent-windlass to get a full view of the fog at the end of the bow-sprit, and took another survey of the buried stay-sails, and the flying-jib. Then he and the Newfoundland sailor on the look-out, had a long consultation of great gravity and importance; and finally he turned around and came up to the place where I was standing, and broke out: \"I say, what the devil are we to do with ourselves this morning?\" \n \n \"What are we to do?\" That eternal question. It instantly seemed to double the thickness of the fog, to arrest the slow movement of the vessel. Picton had nothing to do for a fortnight, and I had left home with the sole object of going somewhere where soul and body could rest. \"Nothing to do,\" was precisely the one thing needful. \"Nothing to do,\" is exquisite happiness, for real happiness is but a negation. \"Nothing to do,\" is repose for the body,[Pg 83] respite for the mind. It is an ideal hammock swinging in drowsy tropical groves, apart from the roar of the busy, relentless world; away from the strife of faction, the toils of business, the restless stretch of ambition, wealth\u0027s tinsel pride, poverty\u0027s galling harness. \"Nothing to do,\" is the phantom of young Imagination, the evanescent hope that promises to crown \n \n \"A youth of labor with an age of ease.\" \n \"Nothing to do,\" was the charm that lured us on board the \"Balaklava,\" and now \"nothing to do,\" was with us like the Bottle-Imp, an incubus, still crying out: \"You may yet exchange me for a smaller coin, if such there be!\" \"Nothing to do,\" is an imposture. Something to do is the very life of life, the beginning and end of being. \"Picton,\" said I, \"one thing we must do, at least, this morning.\" \n \n \"What is that?\" replied the traveller, eagerly opening his mackintosh, and drawing it off so as to be ready to do it. \n \n \"Taking into consideration the slow and sleepy nature of this climate, the thickness of the fog, the faint, thin air that impels the vessel, the early time of day, and the regulations of the \u0027Balaklava,\u0027 it[Pg 84] seems to me we shall have to be steadily occupied, for at least three hours, in waiting for breakfast.\" \n \n Then Picton got hungry! He was a large, stout man, wrapped up by a multitude of garments to the thickness of a polar bear, and when he got hungry, it was on a scale of corresponding dimensions. First he alluded to the fact that we had gone supperless to bed the night before; then he buttoned up his mackintosh, had a brief interview with the captain, shouted down the gang-way for the cook, and finally disappeared in the forecastle. Then he came up again with that officer, rummaged in the galley for the ship\u0027s hatchet, and split up all the kindling-wood on deck; then he shed his petals (mackintosh and over-coats) and instructed Cookey in the mystery of building a fire. Then he emerged from the intolerable smoke he had raised in the galley, and devoted himself to the stove-pipe outside, Cookey, meanwhile, within the caboose, getting the benefit of all the experiments. \n \n At last a faint smell of coffee issued forth from the caboose, a little Arabia breathed through the humid atmosphere, and a sound, as if Cookey were stirring the berries in a pan, was heard in the midst of the smoke. Meanwhile Picton descends in the hold with a bucket of salt-water to enjoy the luxury of a bath, and reappears in full toilet just as Cookey[Pg 85] is grinding the berries, burnt and green, with a hand-mill between his knees. The pan by this time is put to a new use; it is now lined with bacon in full frizzle; presently it will be turned to account as a bake-pan, for pearl-ash cakes of chrome-yellow complexion: everything must take its turn; the pan is the actor of all work; it accepts coffee, cakes, pork, fish, pudding, besides being general dish-washer and soup-warmer, as we found out before long. \n \n During the preparation of these successive courses, Picton and I sat on deck in hungry silence. Now and then an anxious glance at the galley, or a tormenting whiff of the savory viands, would give new life to the demon that raged within us. I believe if Cookey had accidentally upset the coffee tea-kettle, and put out the fire, his sanctuary would have been sacked instantly. Eight o\u0027clock came, and yet we had not broken bread. We walked up and down the deck to relieve our appetites. At last we saw the three cracked mugs, our tea-cups, which had been our ale-glasses of the night before, brought up for a rinse, and then we knew that breakfast was not far off. The cloth was spread, the saffron cakes, ship\u0027s butter, yellow mugs, coffee, pork, and pismires temptingly arrayed. We did not wait to hear the cook ring the bell. We watched him as[Pg 86] he came up with it in his hand, and squeezed past him before he shook out a single vibration. \n \n Then we made a Meal! \n \n Breakfast being over, the fog lightened a little. Our tiny horizon widened its boundaries a few hundred feet, or so; we could see once more the top-mast of the schooner. So we lazily swung along, with nothing to do again. Sometimes a distant fog-bell; sometimes a distant sound across the face of the deep, like the falling of cataract waters. \n \n \"What is that sound, Bruce?\" \n \n \"It\u0027s the surf breakin\u0027 on the rocks,\" responds Bruce; \"I hae been listenen to it for hoors.\" \n \n \"Are we then so near shore?\" \n \n \"About three miles aff,\" replies the mate. \n \n Presently we heard the sound of human voices; a laugh; the stroke of oars in the row-locks, plainly distinguishable in the mysterious vapor. The captain hailed: \"Hallo!\" \"Halloo!\" echoes in answer. The strokes of the oars are louder and quicker; they are approaching us, but where? \"Halloo!\" comes again out of the mist. And again the captain shouts in reply. Then a white phantom boat, thin, vapory, unsubstantial, now seen, now lost again, appears on the skirts of our horizon. \n \n \"Where are we?\" asks the captain. \n \n \"Off St. Esprit,\" answer the boatmen.[Pg 87] \n \n \"What are you after?\" asks the captain. \n \n \"Looking for our nets,\" is the reply; and once more boat and boatmen disappear in the luminous vapor. These are mackerel fishermen; their nets are adrift from their stone-anchors: the fish are used for bait in the cod-fisheries, as well as for salting down. If we could but come across the nets, what a rare treat we might have at dinner! \n \n Lazily on we glide—nothing to do. Picton is reading a stunning book; the captain, his lady, the baby, and I making a small family circle around the wheel; the mate is on the look-out over the bows; all at once, he shouts out: \"There they are! the nets!\" Down goes Picton\u0027s book on the deck; Bruce catches up a rope and fastens it to a large iron hook; the sailors run to the side of the vessel; captain releases his forefinger from baby\u0027s hand, and catches the wheel; all is excitement in a moment. \"Starboard!\" shouts the mate, as the nets come sweeping on, directly in front of the cut-water. The schooner obeys the wheel, sheers off, and now, as the floats come along sidewise, Bruce has dropped his hook in the mesh—it takes hold! and the heavy mass is partially raised up in the water. \"Thousands of them,\" says Picton; sure enough, the whole net is alive with mackerel, splashing, quivering, glistening. \"Catch hold here,[Pg 88] I canna hold them; O the beauties!\" says the mate. Some grasp at the rope, others look around for another hook. \"Hauld \u0027em! hauld \u0027em!\" shouts Bruce; but the weighty piscatorial mass is too much for us, it will drag us desperately along the deck to the stern of the vessel. The schooner is going slowly, but still she is going. Another hook is rigged and thrown at the struggling mesh; but it breaks loose, the mackerel are dragging behind the rudder; we are at our rope\u0027s end. At last, rope, hook, and nets are abandoned, and again we have nothing to do. \n \n High noon, and a red spot visible overhead; the captain brings out his sextant to take an observation. This proceeding we viewed with no little interest, and, for the humor of the thing, I borrowed the sextant of the captain and took a satirical view of a great luminary in obscurity. As I had the instrument upside down, the sailors were in convulsions of laughter; but why should we not make everybody happy when we have it in our power? \n \n High noon, and again hunger overtook us. Picton, by this time, had brought out the cans of preserved meats, the curried tin chicken, the portable soup, the ale and pickles. The cook was put upon duty; pot and pan were scoured for more delicate viands; Picton was chef de cuisine; we had a[Pg 89] magnificent banquet that day on the \"Balaklava.\" \n \n To give a zest to the entertainment, the captain\u0027s lady dined with us; the mate kindly undertaking the charge of the baby. \n \n When we came on deck, after a repast that would have been perfect but for the absence of potatoes, Bruce was marching up and down, dangling the baby in a way that made it appear all legs; \"I doan\u0027t see,\" said he, \"hoo a wummun can lug a baby all day aboot in her airms! I hae only carried this one half an \u0027our, and boath airms is sore. But I suppose it\u0027s naturely, it\u0027s naturely—everything to its nature.\" \n \n The dinner having been a success, Picton was in great spirits for the rest of the day. The fog spread its munificent halo around us, and before nightfall broke into myriads of white rainbows—sea-dogs the sailors call them—and finally lifted so high that we could see the spectral moon shining through the thin rack. Once more we sang \"Annie Laurie;\" the traveller brought out his travelling blanket for a dewy slumber on deck; the lady of the \"Balaklava\" put on her night-cap and retired with baby to the double berth: Bruce took the helm. As I was passing the light in the binnacle, I looked in at the compass for a moment.[Pg 90] \"She\u0027s nailed there,\" said the old mate. Nailed there, true to her course, as steadfast to the guiding rudder as truth is to religion. We were but a few miles from a dangerous coast, in a vessel of the frailest kind, but she was \"nailed there,\" obedient to man\u0027s intelligence, and that was security and safety. What a text to say one\u0027s prayers upon! \n \n \"Picton,\" said I, the next morning, after the schooner-breakfast, \"it seems to me the strangest thing that Mrs. Capstan should have the pure Irish pronunciation and the mate the thorough Scotch brogue, although both were born in Newfoundland, and of Newfoundland parents. I must confess to no small amount of surprise at the complete isolation of the people of these colonies; the divisions among them; the separate pursuits, prejudices, languages; they seem to have nothing in common; no aggregation of interests; it is existence without nationality; sectionalism without emulation; a mere exotic life with not a fibre rooted firmly in the soil. The colonists are English, Irish, Scotch, French, for generation after generation. Why is this, O Picton? Why is it that the captain\u0027s lady has high cheek-bones, and speaks the pure Hibernise? why is the only railroad in the colony but nine and three-quarter miles long, and the great Shubenacadie Canal yet unfinished, although it was begun in the[Pg 91] year 1826; a canal fifty-three mortal miles in length, already engineered and laid out by nature in a chain of lakes, most conveniently arranged with the foot of each little lake at the head of the next one—like \u0027orient pearls at random strung\u0027—requiring but a few locks to be complete: the head of the first lake lying only twelve hundred and ten yards from Halifax harbor, and the Shubenacadie River itself at the other end, emptying in the place of destination, namely, the Basin of Minas; a work that, if completed, would cut off more than three hundred miles of outside voyaging around a stormy, foggy, dangerous coast; a work that was estimated to cost but seventy-five thousand pounds, and for which fifteen thousand pounds had already been subscribed by the government; a work that would be the saving of so many vessels, crews, and cargoes of so much value; a work that would traverse one of the most fertile countries in America; a work that would bring the inland produce within a few hours of the seaboard; a work so necessary, so obvious, so easily completed, that no Yankee could see it undone, if it were within the limits of his county, and have one single night\u0027s rest until the waters were leaping from lock to lock, from lake to lake in one continuous flood of prosperity from[Pg 92] Minas to Chebucto? Why is this, O traveller of the \u0027Balaklava?\u0027\" \n \n \"The reason of it all,\" replied Picton, with great equanimity of manner, \"is entirely owing to the stupidity of the people here; the British government is the best government, sir, in the world; it fosters, protects, and supports the colonies, with a sort of parental care, sir; the colonies, sir, afford no recompense to the British government for its care and protection, sir; each colony is only a bill of expense, sir, to the mother country, and if, with all these advantages, the people of these colonies will persist, sir, in being behind the age, sir, what can we do to prevent it, I would like to know, sir?\" \n \n \"It does seem to me, Picton, this fostering, protecting, and paying the governmental expenses of the colonies, is very like pampering and amusing a child with sweetmeats and nick-nacks, and at the same time keeping it in leading-strings. It is very certain that these colonists would not be the same people if their ancestors had been transplanted, a century or so ago, to our side of the Bay of Fundy; no, not even if they had pitched their tents at the \u0027jumping-off place,\u0027 as it is called—Eastport, for even there they would have produced a crop of pure Yankees, although grown from divers nations, religions, and tongues.\"[Pg 93] \n \n Here Picton turned up his lip, and smiled out of a little battery of sarcasm: \"And you think,\" said he, after a pause, \"that these colonists would no longer revel in those little prejudices and sectionalisms so dear to every American heart, if they were transplanted to your own favored coasts? Why, sir, there is more sectionalism in the country you would transport these people to, than in any one nation I ever heard of; every one of your States is a petty principality; it has its own separate interests; its own bigoted boundaries; its conventionalisms; its pet laws; and as for its prejudices, I will just ask you, as a candid man, not as a Yankee, but as a traveller like myself, a cosmopolite, if you please, what you think of the two great eternal States of Massachusetts and South Carolina, and whether prejudices and sectionalisms are to be fairly charged upon these colonies, and upon them only?\" \n \n \"Picton, I will be frank with you. The States you name are looked upon as the great game-cocks of the union, and we give them a tolerably large arena to fight their battles in. Either champion has flapped its wings and crowed its loudest, and drawn in its local backers, but the great States of my country are not these two. I feel at this moment an almost irrepressible desire to instance a[Pg 94] single one as an example; but insomuch as nobody has ever flapped wing or crowed because of it, I will not be the first to break the silence. This much I will say, there are some States, and those the very greatest in the union, that neither claim to be, nor make a merit of being provincial.\" \n \n \"But, even in your State, you have your stately prejudices,\" said Picton, with a marked emphasis upon the \"stately.\" \n \n \"No, sir, we have no stately prejudices, at least among those entitled to have them, the native-born citizens; nor do I believe such prejudices exist in many of the States with us at home, sir.\" \n \n \"But as you admit there is a sectional barrier between your people,\" said Picton, \"I do not see why our form of government is not as wise as your form of government.\" \n \n \"The difference, Picton, is simply this: your government is foreign, and almost unchangeable; ours is local, and mutable as the flux and reflux of the tide. As a consequence, sectionalism is active with us, and apathetic with you. Your colonists have nothing to care for, and we have everything to care for.\" \n \n \"Then,\" said Picton, \"we can sleep while you struggle?\" \n \n \"Yes, Picton, that is the question—[Pg 95]— \n \n \u0027Whether \u0027tis best to roam or rest. \n The land\u0027s lap, or the water\u0027s breast?\u0027 \n We think it is best to choose the active instead of the stagnant; if a man cannot take part in the great mechanism of humanity, better to die than to sleep. And Picton, so far as this is concerned, so far as the general interests of humanity are concerned, your colonists are only dead men, while our \"stately\" men are individually responsible, not only to their own kind, but to all human kind, and herein each form of government tells its own story.\" \n \n \"I think you are rather severe upon poor Nova Scotia this morning,\" said Picton, drily. \n \n \"You mistake me, Picton; I do not intend to cast any reflections upon the people; I am only contrasting the effects produced by two different forms of government upon neighboring bodies of men that would have been alike had either a republican or monarchical rule obtained over both.\" \n \n \"Likely,\" said Picton, sententiously. \n \n Meantime the schooner was lazily holding her course through the fog, which was now dense as ever. What an odd little bit of ocean this is to be on! \"The sea, the sea, the open sea,\" all your own, with a diameter of perhaps forty yards. Picton, who is full of activity, begins to unroll the log line; the captain turns the glass, away goes the log.[Pg 96] \"Stop,\" \"not three knots!\" and then comes the question again: \"What shall we do?—we are getting becalmed!\" \n \n \"By Jove!\" said Picton, slapping his thigh, \"I have it—cod-fish!\" \n \n There are plenty of hooks on board the \"Balaklava,\" and unfortunately only one cod-line; but what with the deep-sea lead-and-line, and a roll of blue cord, with a spike for a sinker, and the hooks, we are soon in the midst of excitement. Now we almost pray for a calm; the schooner will heave ahead, and leave the lines astern; but nevertheless, up come the fine fish, and plenty of them, too; the deck is all flop and glister with cod, haddock, pollock; and Cookey, with a short knife, is at work with the largest, preparing them for the banquet, according to the code Newfoundland. Certainly the art of \"cooking a cod-fish\" is not quite understood, except in this part of the world. The white flakes do not exhibit the true conchoidal fracture in such perfection elsewhere; nor break off in such delicious morsels, edged with delicate brown. \"Another bottle of ale, please, and a granitic biscuit, and a pickle, by way of dessert.\" \n \n Lazily along swings the \"Balaklava.\" Picton brings up his travelling blanket, and we stretch out upon it on deck, basking in the warm, humid light,[Pg 97] and leisurely puffing away at our segars, for we have nothing else to do. Towards evening it grows colder, very much colder; over-coats are in requisition; the captain says we are nearing some icebergs; the fog folds itself up and hangs above us in strips of cloud, or rolls away in voluminous masses to the edges of the horizon. The stars peep out between the strips overhead, the moon sends forth her silver vapors and finally emerges from the \"crudded clouds;\" the wake of the schooner is one long phosphoric trail of flame; the masts are creaking, sails stretching, the waters pouring against the bows; out on the deep, white crests lift and break, the winds are loosened, and now good speed to the \"Balaklava.\" Meanwhile, the hitherto listless Newfoundland men are now wide awake, and busy; the man at the wheel is on the alert; the captain is looking at his charts; Picton and I walking the deck briskly, but unsteadily, to keep off the cold; Mrs. Capstan has turned in with the baby. Blacker and larger waves are rising, with whiter crests; on and on goes the schooner with dip and rise—tossing her yards as a stag tosses his antlers. On and on goes the brave \"Balaklava,\" the captain at the bows on the look-out; the sky is mottled with clouds, but fortunately there is no fog; nine, ten o\u0027clock, and at last a light[Pg 98] begins to lift in the distance. \"Is it Louisburgh light, captain?\" \"I don\u0027t make it out yet,\" replies Captain Capstan, \"but I think it is not.\" After a pause, he adds: \"Now I see what it is; it is Scattarie light—we have passed Louisburgh.\" \n \n This was not pleasant; we had undertaken the voyage for the sake of visiting the old French town. To be sure, it was a great disappointment. But then we were rapidly nearing Scattarie light; and after we doubled the island, the wind would be right astern of us, and by breakfast time we would be in the harbor of Sydney. \n \n \"Captain,\" said we, after a brief consultation, \"we will leave the matter entirely to you; although we had hoped to see Louisburgh this night, yet we can visit it overland to-morrow; and as the wind is so favorable for you, why, crack on to Sydney, if you like.\" \n \n With that we resumed our walk to keep up the circulation. \n \n \"It is strange,\" said Picton, \"the captain should have passed the light without seeing it.\" \n \n \"Ever since we left Richmond,\" said the man at the wheel, \"his eyes has been weak, so as he couldn\u0027t see as good as common.\" \n \n \"Did you see the light?\" we asked. \n \n \"Oh, yes; I can see it now, right astern of us.\"[Pg 99] \n \n We looked, and at last made it out: a faint, nebulous star, upon the very edge of the gloomy waters. \n \n \"There is the light, captain.\" \n \n \"Where?\" \n \n \"Right astern.\" \n \n The captain walked aft to the steersman and peered anxiously in the distance. Then he came forward again, and shouted down the forecastle: \"Hallo, hallo, turn out there! all hands on deck! turn out, men! turn out!\" \n \n \"What now, captain?\" \n \n \"Nothing,\" said he, \"only I am going to about-ship.\" \n \n And sure enough, the little schooner came up to the wind; the men hauled away at the sheets, the sails fluttered—filled upon the new tack, and in a few minutes our bows were pointed for Louisburgh. \n \n The \"Balaklava\" had barely broadened out her sails to the fair wind, after she had been put about, when we were conscious of an increased straining and chirping of the masts and sails, an uneasy, laborious motion of the vessel; of blacker and larger waves, of whiter and higher crests, that sometimes broke over the bows, even, and made the deck wet and slippery. The moon was now rising high, but the clouds were rapidly thickening, and her majesty seemed to be reeling from side to side, as we bore[Pg 100] on, with plunge and shudder, for the light ahead of us. Bruce had taken the wheel; all hands were on deck, and all busy, hauling upon this rope or that, taking in the stay-sails and flying-jib, as the captain shouted out from time to time; and looking ahead, with no little appearance of anxiety. \n \n \"Ah! she\u0027s a pretty creature,\" said the mate; \"look there,\" nodding with his head at the compass, \"did\u0027na I tell you?
