{"id":35653,"no":66,"title":"Part 1 Book 8 Chapter 3 Javert Satisfied","content":"This is what had taken place.\\n\\n The half-hour after midnight had just struck when M. Madeleine quitted the Hall of Assizes in Arras. He regained his inn just in time to set out again by the mail-wagon, in which he had engaged his place. A little before six o\u0027clock in the morning he had arrived at M. Sur M., and his first care had been to post a letter to M. Laffitte, then to enter the infirmary and see Fantine.\\n\\n However, he had hardly quitted the audience hall of the Court of Assizes, when the district-attorney, recovering from his first shock, had taken the word to deplore the mad deed of the honorable mayor of M. sur M., to declare that his convictions had not been in the least modified by that curious incident, which would be explained thereafter, and to demand, in the meantime, the condemnation of that Champmathieu, who was evidently the real Jean Valjean. The district-attorney\u0027s persistence was visibly at variance with the sentiments of every one, of the public, of the court, and of the jury. The counsel for the defence had some difficulty in refuting this harangue and in establishing that, in consequence of the revelations of M. Madeleine, that is to say, of the real Jean Valjean, the aspect of the matter had been thoroughly altered, and that the jury had before their eyes now only an innocent man. Thence the lawyer had drawn some epiphonemas, not very fresh, unfortunately, upon judicial errors, etc., etc.; the President, in his summing up, had joined the counsel for the defence, and in a few minutes the jury had thrown Champmathieu out of the case.\\n\\n Nevertheless, the district-attorney was bent on having a Jean Valjean; and as he had no longer Champmathieu, he took Madeleine.\\n\\n Immediately after Champmathieu had been set at liberty, the district-attorney shut himself up with the President. They conferred \"as to the necessity of seizing the person of M. Le Maire of M. sur M.\" This phrase, in which there was a great deal of of, is the district-attorney\u0027s, written with his own hand, on the minutes of his report to the attorney-general. His first emotion having passed off, the President did not offer many objections. Justice must, after all, take its course. And then, when all was said, although the President was a kindly and a tolerably intelligent man, he was, at the same time, a devoted and almost an ardent royalist, and he had been shocked to hear the Mayor of M. sur M. say the Emperor, and not Bonaparte, when alluding to the landing at Cannes.\\n\\n The order for his arrest was accordingly despatched. The district-attorney forwarded it to M. sur M. by a special messenger, at full speed, and entrusted its execution to Police Inspector Javert.\\n\\n The reader knows that Javert had returned to M. sur M. Immediately after having given his deposition.\\n\\n Javert was just getting out of bed when the messenger handed him the order of arrest and the command to produce the prisoner.\\n\\n The messenger himself was a very clever member of the police, who, in two words, informed Javert of what had taken place at Arras. The order of arrest, signed by the district-attorney, was couched in these words: \"Inspector Javert will apprehend the body of the Sieur Madeleine, mayor of M. sur M., who, in this day\u0027s session of the court, was recognized as the liberated convict, Jean Valjean.\"\\n\\n Any one who did not know Javert, and who had chanced to see him at the moment when he penetrated the antechamber of the infirmary, could have divined nothing of what had taken place, and would have thought his air the most ordinary in the world. He was cool, calm, grave, his gray hair was perfectly smooth upon his temples, and he had just mounted the stairs with his habitual deliberation. Any one who was thoroughly acquainted with him, and who had examined him attentively at the moment, would have shuddered. The buckle of his leather stock was under his left ear instead of at the nape of his neck. This betrayed unwonted agitation.\\n\\n Javert was a complete character, who never had a wrinkle in his duty or in his uniform; methodical with malefactors, rigid with the buttons of his coat.\\n\\n That he should have set the buckle of his stock awry, it was indispensable that there should have taken place in him one of those emotions which may be designated as internal earthquakes.\\n\\n He had come in a simple way, had made a requisition on the neighboring post for a corporal and four soldiers, had left the soldiers in the courtyard, had had Fantine\u0027s room pointed out to him by the portress, who was utterly unsuspicious, accustomed as she was to seeing armed men inquiring for the mayor.\\n\\n On arriving at Fantine\u0027s chamber, Javert turned the handle, pushed the door open with the gentleness of a sick-nurse or a police spy, and entered.\\n\\n Properly speaking, he did not enter. He stood erect in the half-open door, his hat on his head and his left hand thrust into his coat, which was buttoned up to the chin. In the bend of his elbow the leaden head of his enormous cane, which was hidden behind him, could be seen.\\n\\n Thus he remained for nearly a minute, without his presence being perceived. All at once Fantine raised her eyes, saw him, and made M. Madeleine turn round.\\n\\n The instant that Madeleine\u0027s glance encountered Javert\u0027s glance, Javert, without stirring, without moving from his post, without approaching him, became terrible. No human sentiment can be as terrible as joy.\\n\\n It was the visage of a demon who has just found his damned soul.\\n\\n The satisfaction of at last getting hold of Jean Valjean caused all that was in his soul to appear in his countenance. The depths having been stirred up, mounted to the surface. The humiliation of having, in some slight degree, lost the scent, and of having indulged, for a few moments, in an error with regard to Champmathieu, was effaced by pride at having so well and accurately divined in the first place, and of having for so long cherished a just instinct. Javert\u0027s content shone forth in his sovereign attitude. The deformity of triumph overspread that narrow brow. All the demonstrations of horror which a satisfied face can afford were there.\\n\\n Javert was in heaven at that moment. Without putting the thing clearly to himself, but with a confused intuition of the necessity of his presence and of his success, he, Javert, personified justice, light, and truth in their celestial function of crushing out evil. Behind him and around him, at an infinite distance, he had authority, reason, the case judged, the legal conscience, the public prosecution, all the stars; he was protecting order, he was causing the law to yield up its thunders, he was avenging society, he was lending a helping hand to the absolute, he was standing erect in the midst of a glory. There existed in his victory a remnant of defiance and of combat. Erect, haughty, brilliant, he flaunted abroad in open day the superhuman bestiality of a ferocious archangel. The terrible shadow of the action which he was accomplishing caused the vague flash of the social sword to be visible in his clenched fist; happy and indignant, he held his heel upon crime, vice, rebellion, perdition, hell; he was radiant, he exterminated, he smiled, and there was an incontestable grandeur in this monstrous Saint Michael.\\n\\n Javert, though frightful, had nothing ignoble about him.\\n\\n Probity, sincerity, candor, conviction, the sense of duty, are things which may become hideous when wrongly directed; but which, even when hideous, remain grand: their majesty, the majesty peculiar to the human conscience, clings to them in the midst of horror; they are virtues which have one vice,--error. The honest, pitiless joy of a fanatic in the full flood of his atrocity preserves a certain lugubriously venerable radiance. Without himself suspecting the fact, Javert in his formidable happiness was to be pitied, as is every ignorant man who triumphs. Nothing could be so poignant and so terrible as this face, wherein was displayed all that may be designated as the evil of the good.\\n\\n 马德兰先生从阿拉斯高等法院出来，已是夜间十二时半了。他回到旅馆，正好赶上乘邮车回来，我们记得他早订了一个坐位。不到早晨六点，他便到了滨海蒙特勒伊，他第一桩事便是把寄给拉菲特先生的信送到邮局，再到疗养室去看芳汀。\\n\\n 他离开高等法院的公堂不久，检察官便抑制了一时的慌乱，开始发言，他叹惜这位可敬的滨海蒙特勒伊市长的妄诞行为，声言他绝不因这种奇特的意外事件而改变他原来的见解，这种意外事件究竟为何发生，日后一定可以弄个明白，他并且认为商马第是真的冉阿让，要求先判他的罪。检察官这样坚持原议，显然是和每个旁听人、法庭的各个成员和陪审团的看法相反的。被告的辩护人轻轻几句话便推翻了他这论点，同时还指出这件案子经过马德兰先生，就是说真冉阿让的揭示以后，已经根本改变了面目，因此留在陪审员眼前的只是一个无罪的人。律师把法律程序上的一些错误概括说了一番，不幸的是他这番话并不是什么新的发现，庭长在作结论时也表示他和被告辩护人的见解一致，陪审团在几分钟之内，便宣告对商马第不予起诉。\\n\\n 可是检察官非有一个冉阿让不行，逮不住商马第，便得逮马德兰。\\n\\n 释放了商马第以后，检察官便立即和庭长关在屋子里密谈。他们讨论了“逮捕滨海蒙特勒伊的市长先生的本人的必要性”。这句有许多“的”字的短语，是检察官先生的杰作，是他亲笔写在呈检察长的报告底稿上的。庭长在一度感到紧张之后，并没有怎么反对。法律总不能碰壁。并且老实说，庭长虽然是个有点小聪明的好人，可是他有相当强烈的保王思想，滨海蒙特勒伊市长谈到在戛纳登陆事件时说了“皇上”，而没有说“波拿巴”，他感到很不中听。\\n\\n 于是逮捕状签发出去了。检察官派了专人，星夜兼程送到滨海蒙特勒伊，责成侦察员沙威执行。\\n\\n 我们知道，沙威在作证以后，已经立即回到滨海蒙特勒伊。\\n\\n 沙威正起床，专差便已把逮捕状和传票交给了他。\\n\\n 这专差也是个精干的警吏，一两句话便把在阿拉斯发生的事向沙威交代明白了。逮捕状上有检察官的签字，内容是这样的：“侦察员沙威，速将滨海蒙特勒伊市长马德兰君拘捕归案，马德兰君在本日公审时，已被查明为已释苦役犯冉阿让。”\\n\\n 假使有个不曾见过沙威的人，当时看见他走进那疗养室的前房，这人一定猜想不到发生了什么事，并且还会认为他那神气是世上最平常的。他态度冷静、严肃，灰色头发平平整整地贴在两鬓，他刚才走上楼梯的步伐也是和平日一样从容不迫的。但是假使有个深知其为人的人，并且仔细观察了他，便会感到毛骨悚然。他皮领的钮扣不在他颈后，而在他左耳上边。这说明当时他那种从未有过的惊慌。\\n\\n 沙威是个完人，他的工作态度和穿衣态度都没有一点可以指责的地方，他对暴徒绝不通融，对他衣服上的钮扣也从来一丝不苟。\\n\\n 他居然会把领扣扣歪，那一定是在他心里起了那种所谓“内心地震”的骚乱。\\n\\n 他在邻近的哨所里要了一个伍长和四个兵，便若无其事地来了。他把这些兵留在天井里，叫那看门婆婆把芳汀的屋子告诉他，看门婆婆毫无戒备，因为经常有一些武装的人来找市长先生，她是看惯了的。\\n\\n 沙威走到芳汀的门前，转动门钮，用着护士或暗探的那种柔和劲儿推开门，进来了。\\n\\n 严格地说，他并没有进来，他立在那半开的门口，帽子戴在头上，左手插在他那件一直扣到颈脖的礼服里。肘弯上露出他那根藏在身后的粗手杖的铅头。\\n\\n 他这样立着不动，几乎有一分钟，没有引起任何人的注意。忽然，芳汀抬起眼睛看见了他，又叫马德兰先生转过头去。\\n\\n 当马德兰先生的视线接触到沙威的视线时，沙威并没有动，也不惊，也不走近，只显出一种可怕的神色。在人类的情感方面，最可怕的是得意之色。\\n\\n 这是一副找到了冤家的魔鬼面孔。\\n\\n 他确信自己能够逮住冉阿让，因此他心中的一切全露在脸上了。底部搅浑后影响了水面。他想到自己曾嗅错了路，一时错认了商马第，好不懊恼，幸而他当初识破了他，并且多少年来，一直还是清醒的，想到这里，懊恼也就消散了。沙威的喜色因傲慢的态度而更明显，扁窄的额头因得胜而变得难看。那副沾沾自喜的面孔简直是无丑不备。\\n\\n 这时，沙威如在天庭，他自己虽不十分明了，但对自己的成功和地位的重要却有一种模糊的直觉，他，沙威，人格化了的法律、光明和真理，他是在代表它们执行上天授予的除恶任务。他有无边无际的权力、道理、正义、法治精神、舆论，满天的星斗环绕在他的后面和他的四周。他维护社会秩序，他使法律发出雷霆，他为社会除暴安良，他捍卫绝对真理，他屹立在神光的中央；他虽然已操胜券，却仍有挑衅和搏斗的余勇；他挺身直立，气派雄豪，威风凛凛，把个勇猛天神的超人淫威布满了天空。他正在执行的那件任务的骇人的暗影，使人可以从他那握紧了的拳头上看到一柄象征社会力量的宝剑的寒光。他愉快而愤恨地用脚跟踏着罪恶、丑行、叛逆、堕落、地狱，他发出万丈光芒，他杀人从不眨眼，他满脸堆着笑容，在这威猛天神的身上，确有一种无比伟大的气概。\\n\\n 沙威凶，但绝不下贱。\\n\\n 正直、真诚、老实、自信、忠于职务，这些品质在被曲解时是可以变成丑恶的，不过，即使丑恶，也还有它的伟大；它们的威严是人类的良知所特有的，所以在丑恶之中依然存在。这是一些有缺点的优良品质，这缺点便是它会发生错误。执迷于某一种信念的人，在纵恣暴戾时，有一种寡情而诚实的欢乐，这样的欢乐，莫名其妙竟会是一种阴森而又令人起敬的光芒。沙威在他这种骇人的快乐里，正和每一个得志的小人一样，值得怜悯。那副面孔所表现的，我们可以称之为善中的万恶，世界上没有任何东西比这更惨更可怕的了。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4203.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
