Neither the Convention, nor the death of Louis XVI., nor the Napoleon, nor the return of the Bourbons, nor anything else had been able to efface the memory of this crowning. The Duc de Nevers was, in his eyes, the great figure of the century. \"What a charming grand seigneur,\" he said, \"and what a fine air he had with his blue ribbon!\"\n In the eyes of M. Gillenormand, Catherine the Second had made reparation for the crime of the partition of Poland by purchasing, for three thousand roubles, the secret of the elixir of gold, from Bestucheff. He grew animated on this subject: \"The elixir of gold,\" he exclaimed, \"the yellow dye of Bestucheff, General Lamotte\u0027s drops, in the eighteenth century,--this was the great remedy for the catastrophes of love, the panacea against Venus, at one louis the half-ounce phial. Louis XV. sent two hundred phials of it to the Pope.\" He would have been greatly irritated and thrown off his balance, had any one told him that the elixir of gold is nothing but the perchloride of iron. M. Gillenormand adored the Bourbons, and had a horror of 1789; he was forever narrating in what manner he had saved himself during the Terror, and how he had been obliged to display a vast deal of gayety and cleverness in order to escape having his head cut off. If any young man ventured to pronounce an eulogium on the Republic in his presence, he turned purple and grew so angry that he was on the point of swooning. He sometimes alluded to his ninety years, and said, \"I hope that I shall not see ninety-three twice.\" On these occasions, he hinted to people that he meant to live to be a hundred.\n ①穆兰（Moulins），法国中部阿利埃省的省会。\n ②尼维尔内（Nivernais），法国旧省名，今涅夫勒省（Nièvre），省会讷韦尔（Nevers）。\n ③叶卡特林娜二世（CatherineⅡ，1729-1796），俄国女皇。　\n “金酒，”他喊道，“贝斯多舍夫的黄酊，拉莫特将军的杯中物，在十八世纪，半两装的每瓶值一个路易，是情场失意人的妙药，是降伏爱神的仙露。路易十五就曾送过二百瓶给教皇。”假如有人告诉他说金酒只不过是氯化高铁，他一定会暴跳如雷怒不可遏。吉诺曼先生崇拜波旁王室中人，并把一七八九年视为洪水猛兽，他不断谈到他怎样才在恐怖时期保全了性命，怎样寻欢作乐，怎样卖弄聪明，才没被砍掉脑袋。假如有个年轻人敢在他面前称赞共和制度，他会气到脸色发青，晕倒在地。有时，在谈到自己九十高龄时，他闪烁其词地说：“我很希望不会两次见到九十三。”①有时，他却又向人透露他想活到一百岁。 \n ①两次九十三指革命进入高潮的一七九三年和他自己的九十三岁。 \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4294.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
