{"id":35891,"no":304,"title":"Part 5 Book 2 Chapter 1 The Land Impoverished by the Sea","content":"Paris casts twenty-five millions yearly into the water. And this without metaphor. How, and in what manner? Day and night. With what object? With no object. With what intention? With no intention. Why? For no reason. By means of what organ? By means of its intestine. What is its intestine? The sewer.\n Twenty-five millions is the most moderate approximative figure which the valuations of special science have set upon it.\n Science, after having long groped about, now knows that the most fecundating and the most efficacious of fertilizers is human manure. The Chinese, let us confess it to our shame, knew it before us. Not a Chinese peasant--it is Eckberg who says this,--goes to town without bringing back with him, at the two extremities of his bamboo pole, two full buckets of what we designate as filth. Thanks to human dung, the earth in China is still as young as in the days of Abraham. Chinese wheat yields a hundred fold of the seed. There is no guano comparable in fertility with the detritus of a capital. A great city is the most mighty of dung-makers. Certain success would attend the experiment of employing the city to manure the plain. If our gold is manure, our manure, on the other hand, is gold.\n What is done with this golden manure? It is swept into the abyss. \n Fleets of vessels are despatched, at great expense, to collect the dung of petrels and penguins at the South Pole, and the incalculable element of opulence which we have on hand, we send to the sea. All the human and animal manure which the world wastes, restored to the land instead of being cast into the water, would suffice to nourish the world. \n Those heaps of filth at the gate-posts, those tumbrils of mud which jolt through the street by night, those terrible casks of the street department, those fetid drippings of subterranean mire, which the pavements hide from you,--do you know what they are? They are the meadow in flower, the green grass, wild thyme, thyme and sage, they are game, they are cattle, they are the satisfied bellows of great oxen in the evening, they are perfumed hay, they are golden wheat, they are the bread on your table, they are the warm blood in your veins, they are health, they are joy, they are life. This is the will of that mysterious creation which is transformation on earth and transfiguration in heaven.\n Restore this to the great crucible; your abundance will flow forth from it. The nutrition of the plains furnishes the nourishment of men.\n You have it in your power to lose this wealth, and to consider me ridiculous to boot. This will form the master-piece of your ignorance. \n Statisticians have calculated that France alone makes a deposit of half a milliard every year, in the Atlantic, through the mouths of her rivers. Note this: with five hundred millions we could pay one quarter of the expenses of our budget. The cleverness of man is such that he prefers to get rid of these five hundred millions in the gutter. It is the very substance of the people that is carried off, here drop by drop, there wave after wave, the wretched outpour of our sewers into the rivers, and the gigantic collection of our rivers into the ocean. Every hiccough of our sewers costs us a thousand francs. From this spring two results, the land impoverished, and the water tainted. Hunger arising from the furrow, and disease from the stream.\n It is notorious, for example, that at the present hour, the Thames is poisoning London.\n So far as Paris is concerned, it has become indispensable of late, to transport the mouths of the sewers down stream, below the last bridge.\n A double tubular apparatus, provided with valves and sluices, sucking up and driving back, a system of elementary drainage, simple as the lungs of a man, and which is already in full working order in many communities in England, would suffice to conduct the pure water of the fields into our cities, and to send back to the fields the rich water of the cities, and this easy exchange, the simplest in the world, would retain among us the five hundred millions now thrown away. People are thinking of other things.\n The process actually in use does evil, with the intention of doing good. The intention is good, the result is melancholy. Thinking to purge the city, the population is blanched like plants raised in cellars. A sewer is a mistake. When drainage, everywhere, with its double function, restoring what it takes, shall have replaced the sewer, which is a simple impoverishing washing, then, this being combined with the data of a now social economy, the product of the earth will be increased tenfold, and the problem of misery will be singularly lightened. Add the suppression of parasitism, and it will be solved.\n In the meanwhile, the public wealth flows away to the river, and leakage takes place. Leakage is the word. Europe is being ruined in this manner by exhaustion.\n As for France, we have just cited its figures. Now, Paris contains one twenty-fifth of the total population of France, and Parisian guano being the richest of all, we understate the truth when we value the loss on the part of Paris at twenty-five millions in the half milliard which France annually rejects. These twenty-five millions, employed in assistance and enjoyment, would double the splendor of Paris. The city spends them in sewers. So that we may say that Paris\u0027s great prodigality, its wonderful festival, its Beaujon folly, its orgy, its stream of gold from full hands, its pomp, its luxury, its magnificence, is its sewer system.\n It is in this manner that, in the blindness of a poor political economy, we drown and allow to float down stream and to be lost in the gulfs the well-being of all. There should be nets at Saint-Cloud for the public fortune. \n Economically considered, the matter can be summed up thus: Paris is a spendthrift. Paris, that model city, that patron of well-arranged capitals, of which every nation strives to possess a copy, that metropolis of the ideal, that august country of the initiative, of impulse and of effort, that centre and that dwelling of minds, that nation-city, that hive of the future, that marvellous combination of Babylon and Corinth, would make a peasant of the Fo-Kian shrug his shoulders, from the point of view which we have just indicated. \n Imitate Paris and you will ruin yourselves.\n Moreover, and particularly in this immemorial and senseless waste, Paris is itself an imitator.\n These surprising exhibitions of stupidity are not novel; this is no young folly. The ancients did like the moderns. \"The sewers of Rome,\" says Liebig, \"have absorbed all the well-being of the Roman peasant.\" When the Campagna of Rome was ruined by the Roman sewer, Rome exhausted Italy, and when she had put Italy in her sewer, she poured in Sicily, then Sardinia, then Africa. The sewer of Rome has engulfed the world. This cess-pool offered its engulfment to the city and the universe. Urbi et orbi. Eternal city, unfathomable sewer.\n Rome sets the example for these things as well as for others.\n Paris follows this example with all the stupidity peculiar to intelligent towns.\n For the requirements of the operation upon the subject of which we have just explained our views, Paris has beneath it another Paris; a Paris of sewers; which has its streets, its cross-roads, its squares, its blind-alleys, its arteries, and its circulation, which is of mire and minus the human form.\n For nothing must be flattered, not even a great people; where there is everything there is also ignominy by the side of sublimity; and, if Paris contains Athens, the city of light, Tyre, the city of might, Sparta, the city of virtue, Nineveh, the city of marvels,it also contains Lutetia,the city of mud.\n However, the stamp of its power is there also, and the Titanic sink of Paris realizes, among monuments, that strange ideal realized in humanity by some men like Macchiavelli, Bacon and Mirabeau, grandiose vileness.\n The sub-soil of Paris, if the eye could penetrate its surface, would present the aspect of a colossal madrepore. A sponge has no more partitions and ducts than the mound of earth for a circuit of six leagues round about, on which rests the great and ancient city. Not to mention its catacombs, which are a separate cellar, not to mention the inextricable trellis-work of gas pipes, without reckoning the vast tubular system for the distribution of fresh water which ends in the pillar fountains, the sewers alone form a tremendous, shadowy net-work under the two banks; a labyrinth which has its slope for its guiding thread. \n There appears, in the humid mist, the rat which seems the product to which Paris has given birth.\n 这并非修辞方面的隐喻。怎样抛，又以什么方式？日以继夜。为了什么目的？毫无目的。用意何在？从未考虑过。为什么要这样做？什么也不为。通过什么器官？通过它的肠子。\n 它的肠子是什么？那就是它的下水道。\n 二千五百万是从专业角度估计出来的最低约数。\n 经过长期的摸索，科学今日已经知道肥效最高的肥料就是人肥。中国人，说来令人惭愧，比我们知道得早。没有一个中国农民棗这是埃格勃说的棗进城不用竹子扁担挑两桶满满的我们称之为污物的东西回去。多亏人肥，中国的土地仍和亚伯拉罕①时代那样富于活力。中国小麦的收成，一粒种子能收获一百二十倍的麦子。任何鸟粪都没有首都的垃圾肥效高。一个大城市有着肥效极高的粪肥。利用城市来对田野施肥，这肯定会成功的。如果说我们的黄金是粪尿，反之，我们的粪尿就是黄金。 \n ①亚伯拉罕（Abraham），希伯来民族之始祖。\n 我们的这些黄金粪尿是如何处理的呢？我们把它倒在深渊中。\n 我们花了大量开支，派船队到南极去收集海燕和企鹅的粪，而手边不可估量的致富因素却流入海洋。全世界损失的人兽肥，如归还土地而不抛入水中，就足够使全世界丰衣足食了。\n 这些墙拐角处的垃圾堆，半夜在路上颠簸的一车车淤泥，使人厌恶的清道夫的载运车，铺路石遮盖的在地下流动着的臭污泥，你可知道这是什么？这是鲜花盛开的牧场，是碧绿的草地，是薄荷草，是百里香，是鼠尾草，是野味，是家畜，是大群雄牛晚上知足的哞哞声，是喷香的干草，是金黄的麦穗，是你们桌上的面包，是你们血管中的血液，是健康，是快乐，是生命。神秘的造物主就是要使地上变化无穷，天上改观变形。\n 把这些归还给大熔炉，您将从中得到丰收，平原得到的营养会变为人类的食物。\n 你们可以抛弃这些财富，并且还觉得我很可笑。这是你们愚昧无知的十足表现。\n 根据统计学的计算，仅法国一国每年就从它的河流倾入大西洋五亿法郎。请注意，用这五亿法郎我们就可以支付国家预算开支的四分之一。可是人竟如此高明，宁愿将这五亿扔进河沟里。让我们的阴沟一滴一滴地注入河流，并让河流大量向大海倾泻的，是人民的养分。阴沟每打一个噎，就耗费一千法郎。这就产生两个结果：土壤贫瘠，河流被污染。饥馑来自田畦，疾病来自河流。\n 例如，尽人皆知，现在泰晤士河使伦敦中毒。\n 至于巴黎，最近只得把绝大多数的阴渠出口改到下游最后一座桥的下方。\n 一种双管设备，设有活门和放水闸门，引水进来又排泄出去。一个极简单的排水法，简单得就象人的肺，在英国好几个地区已大量采用，已把田野的清流引进城市并把城市的肥水输入田野。这种世上最简单的一来一去，可以保住扔掉的五亿法郎，然而人们想的是别的事。\n 目前的做法是想办好事却干了坏事。动机是好的，但后果却很糟。他们以为在使城市清洁，其实他们在使人民憔悴，阴渠使用不合理。一旦这种只洗涤而伤元气的阴渠都换成了有两种功能的、吸受后又归还的排水系统，再配上一套新的社会经济体系，那么地里的产物就可以增长十倍，穷困问题将大大缓和。加上又消灭了各类寄生虫，问题将会得到解决。\n 目前，公共的财富流进河里。漏损接连不断。漏损这字眼很恰当，就这样，欧洲因这一消耗而破产。\n 至于法国，我们刚才已提到过它的数字，现在巴黎占全国人口的二十五分之一，而巴黎的粪沟是所有阴沟中最富的，所以在法国，每年抛弃的五亿中估计巴黎损失二千五百万还是一个低于实际的数字。这二千五百万如用在救济和享受方面，可以使巴黎更加繁华，但这个城市却把它花在下水道里。因此我们可以这样说，巴黎最大的挥霍，它奇妙的节日，波戎区的狂欢，它的盛宴，它的挥金如土，它的豪华，它的奢侈，它的华丽，就是它的阴渠。\n 由于这样，一个盲目而又拙劣的政治经济学使公众的福利丧失，付之流水，使它沉没在深渊中。对于公众的财富，应该用上圣克鲁的网①才是。\n 从经济方面来说，这事可以作这样的总结：巴黎是一个漏筐。\n 巴黎，这个模范城市，一切有水平的首都的典范，每个民族都试图仿效它，这个理想的首都，这个创举、推进试验的雄伟策源地，这个精神的中心，这个城市之国，这个创造未来的场所，这个集巴比伦和科林斯之大成者，在我们所指出的方面，却要使一个福建的农民耸肩讥笑。\n 仿效巴黎，就会使你破产。\n 此外，尤其是在这远得无法追忆而又缺乏理智的挥霍方面，巴黎本身也是仿效别人的。\n 这些令人惊异的无能不是新鲜事！这不只是近代产生的愚昧行为。古人和今人的作法相同。李比希②曾说：“罗马的下水道吞没了罗马农民的福利。”当罗马的农村被罗马的阴沟毁灭之后，罗马又使意大利疲惫。它把意大利扔进阴沟里之后，它又把西西里扔进去，然后又扔进了撒丁和非洲。罗马的阴沟把全世界卷了进去，这个下水道淹没了全市和全球。罗马城势遍天下③。这是座不朽之城，无底的坑。 \n ①圣克鲁（Saint－Cloud），法国塞纳河畔的要塞，在该处河中置网，用以拦截河中各种漂流物。\n ②李比希（Liebig，1803-1873），德国化学家。\n ③罗马城势遍天下，原文为拉丁文urbietorbi。　\n 对这些事和对其他事一样，罗马起到了首创作用。\n 巴黎，以一切文化城市固有的傻劲，仿效这块样板。\n 由于我们刚才解释的工序的需要，巴黎在它下面另有一个巴黎，一个阴沟的巴黎，它有它的道路、它的十字路、它的广场、它的死胡同、它的动脉以及污泥的循环，只是缺少人形而已。\n 因为，什么也不要恭维，也不能恭维，这里应有尽有，有壮丽卓绝的一面，也有不光彩的一面；如果巴黎具有雅典城的光明，提尔①城的实力，斯巴达城的道义，尼尼微城的英才，但它也有着吕代斯②的污泥。\n 何况，它的力量的印验也表现在这里，巴黎巨大的肮脏沟道，在所有的大建筑中，这一奇特典型被人类中几个人物所体现，如马基雅弗利、培根③和米拉波，都是可耻的伟大。 \n ①提尔（Tyr），古代腓尼基城市，在地中海东岸。\n ②吕代斯（Lutèce），巴黎古名。\n ③培根（Bacon，1561-1626），英国哲学家，英国唯物主义的创始人，自然科学家和历史学家。\n 如果视线能透过路面，巴黎的地下会呈现出一个巨大的石珊瑚形状，海绵孔也不会比这块上面矗立着伟大古城的、周围有着六法里长的土块下面的狭径和管道更多，还不包括地下墓窟棗这是另一种地窖，还不包括错杂的煤气管，还不算庞大的一直通到取水龙头的饮用水管道系统，单单阴渠本身在河的两岸下面就形成了一个黑暗的网道，斜坡就是这座迷宫的引路线。\n 这儿，在潮湿的烟雾中，出现了大老鼠，就象巴黎分娩出来的一样。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4441.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
