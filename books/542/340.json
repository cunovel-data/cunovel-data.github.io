{"id":35927,"no":340,"title":"Part 5 Book 9 Chapter 1 Pity for the Unhappy, but Indulgence for the Happy","content":"It is a terrible thing to be happy! How content one is! How all-sufficient one finds it! How, being in possession of the false object of life, happiness, one forgets the true object, duty! Let us say, however, that the reader would do wrong were he to blame Marius. Marius, as we have explained, before his marriage, had put no questions to M. Fauchelevent, and, since that time, he had feared to put any to Jean Valjean. He had regretted the promise into which he had allowed himself to be drawn. He had often said to himself that he had done wrong in making that concession to despair. He had confined himself to gradually estranging Jean Valjean from his house and to effacing him, as much as possible, from Cosette\u0027s mind. He had, in a manner, always placed himself between Cosette and Jean Valjean, sure that, in this way, she would not perceive nor think of the latter. It was more than effacement, it was an eclipse. Marius did what he considered necessary and just. He thought that he had serious reasons which the reader has already seen, and others which will be seen later on, for getting rid of Jean Valjean without harshness, but without weakness. Chance having ordained that he should encounter, in a case which he had argued, a former employee of the Laffitte establishment, he had acquired mysterious information, without seeking it, which he had not been able, it is true, to probe, out of respect for the secret which he had promised to guard, and out of consideration for Jean Valjean\u0027s perilous position. He believed at that moment that he had a grave duty to perform: the restitution of the six hundred thousand francs to some one whom he sought with all possible discretion. In the meanwhile, he abstained from touching that money. As for Cosette, she had not been initiated into any of these secrets; but it would be harsh to condemn her also. There existed between Marius and her an all-powerful magnetism, which caused her to do, instinctively and almost mechanically, what Marius wished. She was conscious of Marius\u0027 will in the direction of \"Monsieur Jean,\" she conformed to it. Her husband had not been obliged to say anything to her; she yielded to the vague but clear pressure of his tacit intentions, and obeyed blindly. Her obedience in this instance consisted in not remembering what Marius forgot. She was not obliged to make any effort to accomplish this. Without her knowing why herself, and without his having any cause to accuse her of it, her soul had become so wholly her husband\u0027s that that which was shrouded in gloom in Marius\u0027 mind became overcast in hers. Let us not go too far, however; in what concerns Jean Valjean, this forgetfulness and obliteration were merely superficial. She was rather heedless than forgetful. At bottom, she was sincerely attached to the man whom she had so long called her father; but she loved her husband still more dearly. This was what had somewhat disturbed the balance of her heart, which leaned to one side only. It sometimes happened that Cosette spoke of Jean Valjean and expressed her surprise. Then Marius calmed her: \"He is absent, I think. Did not he say that he was setting out on a journey?\"--\"That is true,\" thought Cosette. \"He had a habit of disappearing in this fashion. But not for so long.\" Two or three times she despatched Nicolette to inquire in the Rue de l\u0027Homme Arme whether M. Jean had returned from his journey. Jean Valjean caused the answer \"no\" to be given. Cosette asked nothing more, since she had but one need on earth, Marius. Let us also say that, on their side, Cosette and Marius had also been absent. They had been to Vernon. Marius had taken Cosette to his father\u0027s grave. Marius gradually won Cosette away from Jean Valjean. Cosette allowed it. Moreover that which is called, far too harshly in certain cases, the ingratitude of children, is not always a thing so deserving of reproach as it is supposed. It is the ingratitude of nature. Nature, as we have elsewhere said, \"looks before her.\" Nature divides living beings into those who are arriving and those who are departing. Those who are departing are turned towards the shadows, those who are arriving towards the light. Hence a gulf which is fatal on the part of the old, and involuntary on the part of the young. This breach, at first insensible, increases slowly, like all separations of branches. The boughs, without becoming detached from the trunk, grow away from it. It is no fault of theirs. Youth goes where there is joy, festivals, vivid lights, love. Old age goes towards the end. They do not lose sight of each other, but there is no longer a close connection. Young people feel the cooling off of life; old people, that of the tomb. Let us not blame these poor children. 然而，说到这事，如果去责怪马吕斯那是不公正的。 马吕斯，我们已经解释过，在结婚前没有盘问过割风先生，此后，他又怕去盘问冉阿让。他对他被动地答应下的诺言感到后悔。他多次感到对失望者的让步是错误的。他只能慢慢地使冉阿让离开他的家，并尽力使珂赛特忘记他。他设法常使自己处于珂赛特和冉阿让之间，这样她肯定不会再看到冉阿让，也不会再去想他。这比忘却更进一步，这等于是消失了。 马吕斯做他认为必须要做的和公正的事，他觉得他有充分理由采取不生硬和坚决的措施摆脱冉阿让，有些理由很重要，这我们已经知道，还有其他的以后我们还将知道。他偶然在他辩护的一件讼事中遇到一个拉菲特银行过去的职员，他没有去寻找就得到了一些保密的材料，这些材料确实是他无法深究的，因为他要遵守他不泄密的诺言，又要顾到冉阿让的危险处境。他认为，此刻他有一件重要的任务要完成，这就是把这六十万法郎归还他在尽量审慎地寻找的原主。目前他不动用此款。 至于珂赛特，她对这些秘密一无所知；要责备她，也未免太苛刻了。 在马吕斯和她之间有一种最强的磁力，能使她出自本能或几乎机械地照马吕斯的愿望行事。她感到对“让先生”，马吕斯有一定的主意；她就顺从。她的丈夫不用向她说什么，她感到了他那虽没说出但很明显的意图的压力而盲从他。她的服从主要在于不去回忆马吕斯已忘却的事。她毫不费力地做到了。她自己也不知为什么，对此也无可谴责，她的心已变得和丈夫的毫无区别，因此马吕斯思想里被阴影遮蔽的东西，在她思想里也变得暗淡了。 然而我们也不必过多地去追究、对冉阿让，这种忘怀和删除只是表面的。她主要是由于疏忽而不是忘记。其实，她很爱这个很久以来就被她称作父亲的人。但她更爱她的丈夫。因此在她内心的天平上有点向一边倾斜的现象。 有时珂赛特谈起了冉阿让而感到诧异，于是马吕斯安慰她说：“我想他不在家，他不是说要去旅行吗？”“不错，”珂赛特暗想，“他是经常这样离开的。但不会这么久。”她曾打发妮珂莱特到武人街去过两三次，问问让先生旅行回来了没有。冉阿让关照回答说没有。 珂赛特不再多问，她在世上唯一所需的人是马吕斯。 我们还要谈到，马吕斯和珂赛特他们也曾离开过家，他们到过维尔农。马吕斯带珂赛特去上他父亲的坟。 马吕斯慢慢地使珂赛特摆脱了冉阿让，珂赛特听从他的摆布。 此外，人们在某些情况下说孩子们忘恩负义，也是过于严厉的，其实这并不象人所想的那样有罪。这种忘怀是属于自然现象。自然，我们在别处提到过，这就是“向前观望”。自然把众生分为到达的和离去的两种。离去的面向阴暗，到达的则向着光明。从这里产生的距离对老人是不利的，而在青年方面则是属于无意识。这种距离，在初期还感觉不到，慢慢地扩展下去就好比树的分枝，细枝虽不脱离树干，但已逐渐远离。这不是他们的过错。青年趋向欢乐、节日、炫目的光彩和爱情，而老人则趋向尽头。虽然互相见面，但已失去紧密的联系。生活使年轻人的感情淡漠，而坟墓则冲淡老年人的感情。不要错怪这些无辜的孩子们。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4477.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
