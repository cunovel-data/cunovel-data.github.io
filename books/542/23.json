{"id":35610,"no":23,"title":"Part 1 Book 2 Chapter 9 New Troubles","content":"When the hour came for him to take his departure from the galleys, when Jean Valjean heard in his ear the strange words, Thou art free! the moment seemed improbable and unprecedented; a ray of vivid light, a ray of the true light of the living, suddenly penetrated within him. But it was not long before this ray paled. Jean Valjean had been dazzled by the idea of liberty. He had believed in a new life. He very speedily perceived what sort of liberty it is to which a yellow passport is provided.\\n\\n And this was encompassed with much bitterness. He had calculated that his earnings, during his sojourn in the galleys, ought to amount to a hundred and seventy-one francs. It is but just to add that he had forgotten to include in his calculations the forced repose of Sundays and festival days during nineteen years, which entailed a diminution of about eighty francs. At all events, his hoard had been reduced by various local levies to the sum of one hundred and nine francs fifteen sous, which had been counted out to him on his departure. He had understood nothing of this, and had thought himself wronged. Let us say the word--robbed.\\n\\n On the day following his liberation, he saw, at Grasse, in front of an orange-flower distillery, some men engaged in unloading bales. He offered his services. Business was pressing; they were accepted. He set to work. He was intelligent, robust, adroit; he did his best; the master seemed pleased. While he was at work, a gendarme passed, observed him, and demanded his papers. It was necessary to show him the yellow passport. That done, Jean Valjean resumed his labor. A little while before he had questioned one of the workmen as to the amount which they earned each day at this occupation; he had been told thirty sous. When evening arrived, as he was forced to set out again on the following day, he presented himself to the owner of the distillery and requested to be paid. The owner did not utter a word, but handed him fifteen sous. He objected. He was told, \"That is enough for thee.\" He persisted. The master looked him straight between the eyes, and said to him \"Beware of the prison.\"\\n\\n There, again, he considered that he had been robbed.\\n\\n Society, the State, by diminishing his hoard, had robbed him wholesale. Now it was the individual who was robbing him at retail.\\n\\n Liberation is not deliverance. One gets free from the galleys, but not from the sentence.\\n\\n That is what happened to him at Grasse. We have seen in what manner he was received at D----\\n\\n 而且在这件事上也还有不少的苦情。他计算过，他的储蓄，按照他在狱中度过的岁月计算，本应有一百七十一个法郎。还应当指出，十九年中，礼拜日和节日的强迫休息大致要使他少赚二十四个法郎，他还忘了把那个数目加入他的账目。不管怎样，他的储蓄经过照例的七折八扣以后，已减到一百○九个法郎十五个苏。那就是他在出狱时所领到的。\\n\\n 他虽然不了解这其中的道理，但他认为他总是吃了亏。让我们把话说明白，他是被人盗窃了。\\n\\n 出狱的第二天，他到了格拉斯，他在一家橙花香精提炼厂的门前，看见许多人在卸货。他请求加入工作。那时工作正吃紧，他们同意了。他便动起手来。他聪明、强壮、伶俐，他尽力搬运，主人好象也满意。正在他工作时，有个警察走过，注意到他，便向他要证件。他只好把那黄护照拿出来。警察看完以后，冉阿让又去工作。他先头问过一个工人，做那种工作每天可以赚多少钱。那工人回答他说：“三十个苏。”到了晚上，他走去找那香精厂的厂主，请把工资付给他，因为他第二天一早便得上路。厂主没说一句话，给了他十五个苏。他提出要求。那人回答他说：“这对你已是够好的了。”他仍旧要。那主人睁圆了两只眼睛对他说：“小心黑屋子。”\\n\\n 那一次，他又觉得自己被盗窃了。\\n\\n 社会、政府，在削减他的储蓄上大大地盗窃了他一次，现在是轮到那小子来偷窃他了。\\n\\n 被释放并不等于得到解放。他固然出了牢狱，但仍背着罪名。\\n\\n 那就是他在格拉斯遇到的事，至于后来他在迪涅受到的待遇，我们已经知道了。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4160.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
