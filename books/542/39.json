The cook-shop was in a bad way.\\n\\n Thanks to the traveller\u0027s fifty-seven francs, Thenardier had been able to avoid a protest and to honor his signature. On the following month they were again in need of money. The woman took Cosette\u0027s outfit to Paris, and pawned it at the pawnbroker\u0027s for sixty francs. As soon as that sum was spent, the Thenardiers grew accustomed to look on the little girl merely as a child whom they were caring for out of charity; and they treated her accordingly. As she had no longer any clothes, they dressed her in the cast-off petticoats and chemises of the Thenardier brats; that is to say, in rags. They fed her on what all the rest had left--a little better than the dog, a little worse than the cat. Moreover, the cat and the dog were her habitual table-companions; Cosette ate with them under the table, from a wooden bowl similar to theirs.\\n\\n The mother, who had established herself, as we shall see later on, at M. sur M., wrote, or, more correctly, caused to be written, a letter every month, that she might have news of her child. The Thenardiers replied invariably, \"Cosette is doing wonderfully well.\"\\n\\n At the expiration of the first six months the mother sent seven francs for the seventh month, and continued her remittances with tolerable regularity from month to month. The year was not completed when Thenardier said: \"A fine favor she is doing us, in sooth! What does she expect us to do with her seven francs?\" and he wrote to demand twelve francs. The mother, whom they had persuaded into the belief that her child was happy, \"and was coming on well,\" submitted, and forwarded the twelve francs.\\n\\n Certain natures cannot love on the one hand without hating on the other. Mother Thenardier loved her two daughters passionately, which caused her to hate the stranger.\\n\\n It is sad to think that the love of a mother can possess villainous aspects. Little as was the space occupied by Cosette, it seemed to her as though it were taken from her own, and that that little child diminished the air which her daughters breathed. This woman, like many women of her sort, had a load of caresses and a burden of blows and injuries to dispense each day. If she had not had Cosette, it is certain that her daughters, idolized as they were, would have received the whole of it; but the stranger did them the service to divert the blows to herself. Her daughters received nothing but caresses. Cosette could not make a motion which did not draw down upon her head a heavy shower of violent blows and unmerited chastisement. The sweet, feeble being, who should not have understood anything of this world or of God, incessantly punished, scolded, ill-used, beaten, and seeing beside her two little creatures like herself, who lived in a ray of dawn!\\n\\n Madame Thenardier was vicious with Cosette. Eponine and Azelma were vicious. Children at that age are only copies of their mother. The size is smaller; that is all.\\n\\n A year passed; then another.\\n\\n People in the village said:--\\n\\n \"Those Thenardiers are good people. They are not rich, and yet they are bringing up a poor child who was abandoned on their hands!\"\\n\\n They thought that Cosette\u0027s mother had forgotten her.\\n\\n In the meanwhile, Thenardier, having learned, it is impossible to say by what obscure means, that the child was probably a bastard, and that the mother could not acknowledge it, exacted fifteen francs a month, saying that \"the creature\" was growing and \"eating,\" and threatening to send her away. \"Let her not bother me,\" he exclaimed, \"or I\u0027ll fire her brat right into the middle of her secrets. I must have an increase.\" The mother paid the fifteen francs.\\n\\n From year to year the child grew, and so did her wretchedness.\\n\\n As long as Cosette was little, she was the scape-goat of the two other children; as soon as she began to develop a little, that is to say, before she was even five years old, she became the servant of the household.\\n\\n Five years old! the reader will say; that is not probable. Alas! it is true. Social suffering begins at all ages. Have we not recently seen the trial of a man named Dumollard, an orphan turned bandit, who, from the age of five, as the official documents state, being alone in the world, \"worked for his living and stole\"?\\n\\n Cosette was made to run on errands, to sweep the rooms, the courtyard, the street, to wash the dishes, to even carry burdens. The Thenardiers considered themselves all the more authorized to behave in this manner, since the mother, who was still at M. sur M., had become irregular in her payments. Some months she was in arrears.\\n\\n If this mother had returned to Montfermeil at the end of these three years, she would not have recognized her child. Cosette, so pretty and rosy on her arrival in that house, was now thin and pale. She had an indescribably uneasy look. \"The sly creature,\" said the Thenardiers.\\n\\n Injustice had made her peevish, and misery had made her ugly. Nothing remained to her except her beautiful eyes, which inspired pain, because, large as they were, it seemed as though one beheld in them a still larger amount of sadness.\\n\\n It was a heart-breaking thing to see this poor child, not yet six years old, shivering in the winter in her old rags of linen, full of holes, sweeping the street before daylight, with an enormous broom in her tiny red hands, and a tear in her great eyes.\\n\\n She was called the Lark in the neighborhood. The populace, who are fond of these figures of speech, had taken a fancy to bestow this name on this trembling, frightened, and shivering little creature, no bigger than a bird, who was awake every morning before any one else in the house or the village, and was always in the street or the fields before daybreak.\\n\\n Only the little lark never sang.\\n\\n 幸而有那女客的五十七个法郎，德纳第得免于官厅的追究，他出的期票也保持了信用。下一个月他仍旧缺钱，那妇人便把珂赛特的衣服饰物带到巴黎，向当店押了六十法郎。那笔款子用完以后，德纳第夫妇便立刻认为他们带那孩子是在救济别人，因此那孩子在他家里经常受到被救济者的待遇。她的衣服被典光以后，他们便叫她穿德纳第家小姑娘的旧裙和旧衫，就是说，破裙和破衫。他们把大家吃剩的东西给她吃，她吃得比狗好一些，比猫又差一些，并且猫和狗还经常是她的同餐者；珂赛特用一只木盆，和猫狗的木盆一样，和猫狗一同在桌子底下吃。\\n\\n 她的母亲在滨海蒙特勒伊住下来了，我们以后还会谈到的，她每月写信，应当说，她每月请人写信探问她孩子的消息。\\n\\n 德纳第夫妇千篇一律地回复说：“珂赛特安好异常。”\\n\\n 最初六个月满了以后，她母亲把第七个月的七个法郎寄去，并且月月都按期寄去，相当准时。一年还不到，德纳第汉子便说：“她给了我们多大的面子！她要我们拿她这七个法郎干什么？”于是他写信硬要十二法郎。他们向这位母亲说她的孩子快乐平安，母亲曲意迁就，照寄了十二法郎。\\n\\n 某些人不能只爱一面而不恨其他一面。德纳第婆子酷爱她自己的两个女儿，因而也厌恶那外来的孩子。一个慈母的爱会有它丑恶的一面，想来真使人失望。珂赛特在她家里尽管只占一点点地方，她仍觉得她夺了她家里人的享受，仿佛那孩子把她两个小女儿呼吸的空气也减少了一样。那妇人，和许多和她同一类型的妇人一样，每天都有一定数量的抚爱和一定数量的打骂要发泄。假使她没有珂赛特，她那两个女儿，尽管百般宠爱，一定也还是要受尽她的打骂的。但是那个外来的女孩做了她们的替身，代受了打骂。她自己的两个女儿却只消受她的爱抚。珂赛特的一举一动都会受到一阵冰雹似的殴打，凶横无理之极。一个柔和、幼弱、还一点也不了解人生和上帝是什么的孩子，却无时不受惩罚、辱骂、虐待、殴打，还得瞧着那两个和她一样的女孩儿享受她们孩提时期的幸福！\\n\\n 德纳第婆子既狠心，爱潘妮和阿兹玛便也狠心。孩子们，在那种小小年纪总是母亲的再版。版本的大小有所不同而已。\\n\\n 一年过了，又是一年。\\n\\n 那村子里的人说：\\n\\n “德纳第一家子都是好人。他们并不宽裕，却还抚养人家丢在他们家里的一个穷孩子！”\\n\\n 大家都认为珂赛特已被她的母亲忘记了。\\n\\n 同时，那德纳第汉子不知从什么密报中探听到那孩子大致是私生的，母亲不便承认，于是他硬敲每月十五法郎，说那“畜生”长大了，“要东西吃”，并且以送还孩子来要挟。“她敢不听我的话！”他吼道，“我也不管她瞒人不瞒人，把孩子送还给她就是。非加我的钱不行。”那母亲照寄十五法郎。\\n\\n 年复一年，孩子长大了，她的苦难也增加了。\\n\\n 珂赛特在极小时，一向是代那两个孩子受罪的替身；当她的身体刚长大一点，就是说连五岁还没有到的时候，她又成了这家人的仆人。\\n\\n 五岁，也许有人说，那不见得确有其事吧。唉！确有其事。人类社会的痛苦的起始是不限年齿的。最近我们不是见过杜美拉的案子，一个孤儿，当了土匪，据官厅的文件说，他从五岁起，便独自一人在世上“作工餬口，从事盗窃”吗？\\n\\n 他们叫珂赛特办杂事，打扫房间、院子、街道，洗杯盘碗盏，甚至搬运重东西。她的母亲一向住在滨海蒙特勒伊，德纳第夫妇见到她近来寄钱没有从前那样准时了，便更加觉得有理由那样对待孩子。有几个月没有寄钱来了。\\n\\n 假使那母亲在那第三年的年末来到孟费郿，她一定会不认识她的孩子了。珂赛特，当她到这一家的时候，是那样美丽，那样红润，现在是又黄又瘦。她的举动，也不知道为什么会那样缩手缩脚。德纳第夫妇老说她“鬼头鬼脑”！\\n\\n 待遇的不平使她性躁，生活的艰苦使她变丑。她只还保有那双秀丽的眼睛，使人见了格外难受，因为她的眼睛是那么大，看去就仿佛那里的愁苦也格外多。\\n\\n 冬天，看见这个还不到六岁的可怜的孩子衣衫褴褛，在寒气中战栗，天还没亮，便拿着一把大扫帚，用她的小红手紧紧握着它打扫街道，一滴泪珠挂在她那双大眼睛的边上，好不叫人痛心。\\n\\n 在那里，大家叫她百灵鸟。那小妞儿原不比小鸟大多少，并且老是哆哆嗦嗦，凡事都使她惊慌，战栗，每天早晨在那一家和那一村里老是第一个醒来，不到天亮，便已到了街上或田里，一般爱用比喻的人便替她取了这个名字。\\n\\n 不过这只百灵鸟从来不歌唱。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4176.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
