{"id":35734,"no":147,"title":"Part 3 Book 1 Chapter 7 The Gamin should have his Place in the Classifications of India","content":"The body of street Arabs in Paris almost constitutes a caste. One might almost say: Not every one who wishes to belong to it can do so.\n This word gamin was printed for the first time, and reached popular speech through the literary tongue, in 1834. It is in a little work entitled Claude Gueux that this word made its appearance. The horror was lively. The word passed into circulation.\n The elements which constitute the consideration of the gamins for each other are very various. We have known and associated with one who was greatly respected and vastly admired because he had seen a man fall from the top of the tower of Notre-Dame; another, because he had succeeded in making his way into the rear courtyard where the statues of the dome of the Invalides had been temporarily deposited, and had \"prigged\" some lead from them; a third, because he had seen a diligence tip over; still another, because he \"knew\" a soldier who came near putting out the eye of a citizen.\n This explains that famous exclamation of a Parisian gamin, a profound epiphonema, which the vulgar herd laughs at without comprehending,--Dieu de Dieu! What ill-luck I do have! to think that I have never yet seen anybody tumble from a fifth-story window! (I have pronounced I\u0027ave and fifth pronounced fift\u0027.)\n Surely, this saying of a peasant is a fine one: \"Father So-and-So, your wife has died of her malady; why did you not send for the doctor?\" \"What would you have, sir, we poor folks die of ourselves.\" But if the peasant\u0027s whole passivity lies in this saying, the whole of the free-thinking anarchy of the brat of the faubourgs is, assuredly, contained in this other saying. A man condemned to death is listening to his confessor in the tumbrel. The child of Paris exclaims: \"He is talking to his black cap! Oh, the sneak!\"\n A certain audacity on matters of religion sets off the gamin. To be strong-minded is an important item.\n To be present at executions constitutes a duty. He shows himself at the guillotine, and he laughs. He calls it by all sorts of pet names: The End of the Soup, The Growler, The Mother in the Blue (the sky), The Last Mouthful, etc., etc. In order not to lose anything of the affair, he scales the walls, he hoists himself to balconies, he ascends trees, he suspends himself to gratings, he clings fast to chimneys. The gamin is born a tiler as he is born a mariner. A roof inspires him with no more fear than a mast. There is no festival which comes up to an execution on the Place de Greve. Samson and the Abbe Montes are the truly popular names. They hoot at the victim in order to encourage him. They sometimes admire him. Lacenaire, when a gamin, on seeing the hideous Dautin die bravely, uttered these words which contain a future: \"I was jealous of him.\" In the brotherhood of gamins Voltaire is not known, but Papavoine is. \"Politicians\" are confused with assassins in the same legend. They have a tradition as to everybody\u0027s last garment. It is known that Tolleron had a fireman\u0027s cap, Avril an otter cap, Losvel a round hat, that old Delaporte was bald and bare-headed, that Castaing was all ruddy and very handsome, that Bories had a romantic small beard, that Jean Martin kept on his suspenders, that Lecouffe and his mother quarrelled. \"Don\u0027t reproach each other for your basket,\" shouted a gamin to them. Another, in order to get a look at Debacker as he passed, and being too small in the crowd, caught sight of the lantern on the quay and climbed it. A gendarme stationed opposite frowned. \"Let me climb up, m\u0027sieu le gendarme,\" said the gamin. And, to soften the heart of the authorities he added: \"I will not fall.\" \"I don\u0027t care if you do,\" retorted the gendarme.\n In the brotherhood of gamins, a memorable accident counts for a great deal. One reaches the height of consideration if one chances to cut one\u0027s self very deeply, \"to the very bone.\"\n The fist is no mediocre element of respect. One of the things that the gamin is fondest of saying is: \"I am fine and strong, come now!\" To be left-handed renders you very enviable. A squint is highly esteemed.\n “野孩”（gamin）这个词，到一八三四年才初次印成文字，由人民的语言进入文学词汇。它是在一本题名为《克洛德·格》的小书里初次出现的。当时曾使舆论哗然，这个词却被接受了。\n 使那些野孩相互间得到敬重的因素是多种多样的。我们认识一个野孩，并且和他有点交往，他因见到过一个人从圣母院的塔顶上摔下来而受到高度敬重和钦佩；另外一个，是因为他曾千方百计钻进一个后院，并且从暂时寄放在那里的几个从残废军人院圆屋顶上取下的塑像身上“摸”了一些铅块；第三个，因为见过公共马车翻身；还有一个，因为他“认识”一个几乎打瞎了一个老财的眼睛的士兵。\n 这才让我们理解到为什么一个巴黎的野孩会嚷出这样的话：“天主的天主！我有没有倒霉事儿！只需说我还一直没见过一个人从五层楼上摔下来呢！”Ai－je（我有没有）说成j’ai－ty，cinquième（第五）说成cintième。那种含义深远的警句是俗物听不懂的，只能一笑了之。\n 下面这是个乡下人说的话，那当然是一种妙语：“我说伯伯，您的老婆害病死了，您为什么没有找医生？”\n “那有什么办法，先生，我们这些穷人，我们自己死自己的就是了。”假如那样的谈话能代表乡下人的那种辛辣的被动性格，下面的这句就必然能代表郊区小孩那种无政府主义的自由思想。一个被判处死刑的人在囚车里听着他的忏悔神甫说教。巴黎的孩子嚷了起来：“他和吃教门饭的讲话。哈！这孱头！”\n 在具有宗教意味的事物前表示一定程度的勇敢，可以抬高野孩的声望。意志坚强是重要的。\n 赶法场，成了一种义务。大家指着断头台笑。他们替那东西取了各色各样的小名：面包汤的末日、嘟囔鬼、升天娘娘、最后一口，等等。为了要看个清楚，便爬墙，登阳台，上树，攀铁栅栏，跨烟囱。野孩生来就是盖瓦工人，正如他生来就是水手一样。在他看来，房顶并不比桅杆更可怕。没有比格雷沃更热闹的场合了。桑松①和孟台斯神甫②真是两个无人不知谁人不晓的名字。为了鼓励那受刑的人，大家围着他喝彩。有时也对他表示羡慕。拉色内尔③在当野孩时，望着那可怕的多坦从容就刑时说过这样一句谶语：“我真动了醋劲儿。”在那野孩群里，没有人知道伏尔泰，却有人知道巴巴弗因。他们把“政治家”和凶杀犯混为一谈。他们把每个人最后一刻的模样都口口相传保存下来。他们知道多勒隆戴一顶司机帽，阿弗利戴一顶獭皮便帽，卢韦尔戴一顶圆顶宽边帽，老德拉波尔特是个秃子，光着头，加斯旦肤色红嫩、非常漂亮，波利斯留着浪漫派的短胡子，让·马尔丹还背着他的吊裤带，勒古费和他的母亲吵架。“别为你的筐子④罗嗦了。”有个野孩冲着他们喊。另一个，为了要看德巴凯走过，由于挤在人堆里太矮了，在看到河沿上的路灯杆时便爬了上去。一个在那里站岗的警察皱起眉头。 \n ①桑松（Samson），当时执行死刑的刽子手。\n ②孟台斯（Monfès），当时陪死刑犯至刑台就刑之神甫。\n ③拉色内尔（Lacenaire），一个在一八三六年被处死刑的杀人犯。\n ④筐子指无法挽救的事，出自成语“再见，筐子，葡萄已经收过了。”\n “请让我上去，警察先生。”那野孩说。为了软化那官长，他又补上一句：“我不会摔交的。”“我才不管你摔不摔交呢。”那警察答道。\n 在野孩群里，凡是难忘的意外都是极受重视的。孩子会获得最大的敬意，要是他偶然很重地割了自己一刀“直到骨头”。\n 拳头不是一种微不足道的使人尊敬的因素。野孩最爱说的是“放心，我浑身是劲！”左撇子相当受人羡慕，斗鸡眼也为人珍惜。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4284.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
