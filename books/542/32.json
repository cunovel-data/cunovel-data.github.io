{"id":35619,"no":32,"title":"Part 1 Book 3 Chapter 5 At Bombardas","content":"The Russian mountains having been exhausted, they began to think about dinner; and the radiant party of eight, somewhat weary at last, became stranded in Bombarda\u0027s public house, a branch establishment which had been set up in the Champs-Elysees by that famous restaurant-keeper, Bombarda, whose sign could then be seen in the Rue de Rivoli, near Delorme Alley. A large but ugly room, with an alcove and a bed at the end (they had been obliged to put up with this accommodation in view of the Sunday crowd); two windows whence they could survey beyond the elms, the quay and the river; a magnificent August sunlight lightly touching the panes; two tables; upon one of them a triumphant mountain of bouquets, mingled with the hats of men and women; at the other the four couples seated round a merry confusion of platters, dishes, glasses, and bottles; jugs of beer mingled with flasks of wine; very little order on the table, some disorder beneath it; \"They made beneath the table A noise, a clatter of the feet that was abominable,\" says Moliere. This was the state which the shepherd idyl, begun at five o\u0027clock in the morning, had reached at half-past four in the afternoon. The sun was setting; their appetites were satisfied. The Champs-Elysees, filled with sunshine and with people, were nothing but light and dust, the two things of which glory is composed. The horses of Marly, those neighing marbles, were prancing in a cloud of gold. Carriages were going and coming. A squadron of magnificent body-guards, with their clarions at their head, were descending the Avenue de Neuilly; the white flag, showing faintly rosy in the setting sun, floated over the dome of the Tuileries. The Place de la Concorde, which had become the Place Louis XV. once more, was choked with happy promenaders. Many wore the silver fleur-de-lys suspended from the white-watered ribbon, which had not yet wholly disappeared from button-holes in the year 1817. Here and there choruses of little girls threw to the winds, amid the passersby, who formed into circles and applauded, the then celebrated Bourbon air, which was destined to strike the Hundred Days with lightning, and which had for its refrain:-- \"Rendez-nous notre pere de Gand, Rendez-nous notre pere.\" \"Give us back our father from Ghent, Give us back our father.\" Groups of dwellers in the suburbs, in Sunday array, sometimes even decorated with the fleur-de-lys, like the bourgeois, scattered over the large square and the Marigny square, were playing at rings and revolving on the wooden horses; others were engaged in drinking; some journeyman printers had on paper caps; their laughter was audible. Every thing was radiant. It was a time of undisputed peace and profound royalist security; it was the epoch when a special and private report of Chief of Police Angeles to the King, on the subject of the suburbs of Paris, terminated with these lines:-- \"Taking all things into consideration, Sire, there is nothing to be feared from these people. They are as heedless and as indolent as cats. The populace is restless in the provinces; it is not in Paris. These are very pretty men, Sire. It would take all of two of them to make one of your grenadiers. There is nothing to be feared on the part of the populace of Paris the capital. It is remarkable that the stature of this population should have diminished in the last fifty years; and the populace of the suburbs is still more puny than at the time of the Revolution. It is not dangerous. In short, it is an amiable rabble.\" Prefects of the police do not deem it possible that a cat can transform itself into a lion; that does happen, however, and in that lies the miracle wrought by the populace of Paris. Moreover, the cat so despised by Count Angles possessed the esteem of the republics of old. In their eyes it was liberty incarnate; and as though to serve as pendant to the Minerva Aptera of the Piraeus, there stood on the public square in Corinth the colossal bronze figure of a cat. The ingenuous police of the Restoration beheld the populace of Paris in too \"rose-colored\" a light; it is not so much of \"an amiable rabble\" as it is thought. The Parisian is to the Frenchman what the Athenian was to the Greek: no one sleeps more soundly than he, no one is more frankly frivolous and lazy than he, no one can better assume the air of forgetfulness; let him not be trusted nevertheless; he is ready for any sort of cool deed; but when there is glory at the end of it, he is worthy of admiration in every sort of fury. Give him a pike, he will produce the 10th of August; give him a gun, you will have Austerlitz. He is Napoleon\u0027s stay and Danton\u0027s resource. Is it a question of country, he enlists; is it a question of liberty, he tears up the pavements. Beware! his hair filled with wrath, is epic; his blouse drapes itself like the folds of a chlamys. Take care! He will make of the first Rue Grenetat which comes to hand Caudine Forks. When the hour strikes, this man of the faubourgs will grow in stature; this little man will arise, and his gaze will be terrible, and his breath will become a tempest, and there will issue forth from that slender chest enough wind to disarrange the folds of the Alps. It is, thanks to the suburban man of Paris, that the Revolution, mixed with arms, conquers Europe. He sings; it is his delight. Proportion his song to his nature, and you will see! As long as he has for refrain nothing but la Carmagnole, he only overthrows Louis XVI.; make him sing the Marseillaise, and he will free the world. This note jotted down on the margin of Angles\u0027 report, we will return to our four couples. The dinner, as we have said, was drawing to its close. 一间房间，宽敞而丑陋，里面有壁厢，厢底有床（由于星期日酒楼人满，只得忍受那样的地方）；两扇窗子，凭窗可以眺望榆树外面的河水和河岸，一股八月的明媚阳光正射在窗口；两张桌子，一张上面有着堆积如山的鲜花以及男人和女人的帽子，另一张，则由这四对朋友占了，他们团团坐在一堆喜气洋洋的杯盘瓶碟的周围，啤酒罐和葡萄酒瓶杂陈，桌上不大有秩序，桌下更是有点乱。 “他们用脚在桌子下面搞得乒零乓郎一团糟。”莫里哀说过。 这就是从早晨五点开始的那次郊游到了下午四点半钟时的情形。太阳西沉了，意兴也阑珊了。 充满了日光和人群的爱丽舍广场只见阳光和灰尘，那是构成光辉的两种东西。马尔利雕刻的一群石马，在金粉似的烟尘中立在后蹄上，引颈长鸣。华丽的马车川流不息。一队堂皇富丽的近卫骑兵，随着喇叭，从讷伊林荫大道走下来，一面白旗①在斜阳返照中带着淡红颜色，在杜伊勒里宫的圆顶上飘荡。协和广场（当时已经恢复旧名，叫路易十五广场）上人山人海，个个喜气洋洋。许多人的衣纽上还佩着一朵吊在一条白闪缎带上的银百合花，那种东西，到一八一七年还没有完全绝迹。这儿那儿，成群的小女孩，在过路闲人围观鼓掌声中跳着团圆舞，迎风唱着一种波旁舞曲，那种舞曲，本是用来打倒百日帝政的，直到当时还流行，其中的叠句是： 送还我们根特②的伯伯， 送还我们的伯伯。 ①波旁王朝的旗帜。 ②根特（Gand），比利时城市，百日帝政期间，路易十八逃亡在那里。 一群群近郊居民，穿着节日的漂亮衣服，有些还模仿绅士，也佩上一朵百合花，四散在大方场和马里尼方场上，玩着七连环游戏或是骑着木马兜圆圈，其余一些人喝着酒；印刷厂里的几个学徒，戴着纸帽，又说又笑。处处都光辉灿烂。无可否认，那确是国泰民安，君权巩固的时代。警署署长昂格勒斯曾向国王递过一本私人密奏，谈到巴黎四郊的情形，他最后的几句话是这样的：“陛下，根据各方面的缜密观察，这些人民不足为畏。他们都和猫儿一样，懒惰驯良。外省的下民好骚动，巴黎的人民却不然。这全是些小民，陛下，要两个这样的小民叠起来，才抵得上一个近卫军士。在首都的民众方面，完全没有可虑的地方。五十年来，人民的身材又缩小了，这是值得注意的，巴黎四郊的人民，比革命前更矮小了。他们不足为害。总而言之，这都是些贱民，驯良的贱民。” 警署署长们是绝不相信猫能变成狮子的，然而事实上却是可能的，而且那正是巴黎人民的奇迹。就拿猫来说吧，昂格勒斯那样瞧不起猫，猫却受到古代共和国的尊重，他们认为猫是自由的化身，在科林斯①城的公共广场上，就有一只极大的紫铜猫，仿佛是和比雷埃夫斯②的那尊无翅膀的密涅瓦塑像作对衬似的。复辟时代的警察太天真，把巴黎的人民看得太“易与”了。恰恰相反，他们绝不是“驯良的贱民”，巴黎人之于法兰西人，正如雅典人之于希腊人，他比任何人都睡得好些，他比任何人都着实要来得轻佻懒惰些，没有人比他更显得健忘，但是切不可以为他们是可靠的，他尽可以百般疏懒，但是一旦光荣在望，他便会奋不顾身，什么都干的。给他一支矛吧，他可以干出八月十日③的事，给他一支枪吧，他可以再有一次奥斯特里茨。他是拿破仑的支柱，丹东④的后盾。国家发生了问题？他捐躯行伍；自由发生了问题？他喋血街头；留神！他的怒发令人难忘；他的布衫可以和希腊的宽袍媲美，他会象在格尔内塔街那样，迫使强敌投降。当心！时机一到，这个郊区的居民就会长大起来的。这小子会站起来，怒目向人，他吐出的气将变成飓风，从他孱弱的胸中，会呼出足够的风，来改变阿尔卑斯山的丘壑。革命之所以能够战胜欧洲，全赖军队里巴黎郊区的居民。他歌唱，那是他的欢乐。你让他的歌适合他的性格，你看着吧！如果他唱来唱去只有《卡玛尼奥拉》⑤一首歌，他当然只能推倒路易十六；但你如果叫他唱《马赛曲》，他便能拯救全世界。 ①科林斯（Corinthe），古希腊城市。 ②比雷埃夫斯（Pirée），希腊港口。 ③一七九二年八月十日，巴黎人民攻入王宫，逮捕国王，推翻了君主政体。 ④丹东（Danton），雅各宾派的右翼领袖。 ⑤《卡玛尼奥拉》（Carmagnolle），法国大革命时期歌曲之一，针对玛丽·安东尼特而作。 我们在昂格勒斯奏本的边上写了这段评语以后，再回头来说我们的那四对情人。我们说过，晚餐已经用完了。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4169.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
