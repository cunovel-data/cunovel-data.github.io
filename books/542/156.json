Caught between two fires, he had beaten a heroic retreat towards a little dancer, a young girl named Nahenry, who was sixteen like himself, obscure as a cat, and with whom he was in love. He abounded in memories. He was accustomed to exclaim: \"How pretty she was--that Guimard-Guimardini-Guimardinette, the last time I saw her at Longchamps, her hair curled in sustained sentiments, with her come-and-see of turquoises, her gown of the color of persons newly arrived, and her little agitation muff!\" He had worn in his young manhood a waistcoat of Nain-Londrin, which he was fond of talking about effusively. \"I was dressed like a Turk of the Levant Levantin,\" said he. Madame de Boufflers, having seen him by chance when he was twenty, had described him as \"a charming fool.\" He was horrified by all the names which he saw in politics and in power, regarding them as vulgar and bourgeois. He read the journals, the newspapers, the gazettes as he said, stifling outbursts of laughter the while. \"Oh!\" he said, \"what people these are! Corbiere! Humann! Casimir Perier! There\u0027s a minister for you! I can imagine this in a journal: `M. Gillenorman, minister!\u0027 that would be a farce. Well! They are so stupid that it would pass\"; he merrily called everything by its name, whether decent or indecent, and did not restrain himself in the least before ladies. He uttered coarse speeches, obscenities, and filth with a certain tranquillity and lack of astonishment which was elegant. It was in keeping with the unceremoniousness of his century. It is to be noted that the age of periphrase in verse was the age of crudities in prose. His god-father had predicted that he would turn out a man of genius, and had bestowed on him these two significant names: Luc-Esprit.\n ①卡玛尔戈（Camargo，1710-1770），巴黎歌剧院有名的芭蕾舞演员，比利时人。\n ②吉玛尔（Guimard，1743-1816），有名的芭蕾舞女演员。\n ③“快来瞧”，新奇的首饰或其他东西的统称。\n ④一种薄呢，法国南部对伦敦呢的仿制品，销往东方各国。\n ⑤读小册子的另一意义是干望着别人吃东西，自己没有份。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4293.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
