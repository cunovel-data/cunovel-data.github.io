{"id":35710,"no":123,"title":"Part 2 Book 6 Chapter 10 Origin of the Perpetual Adoration","content":"However, this almost sepulchral parlor, of which we have sought to convey an idea, is a purely local trait which is not reproduced with the same severity in other convents. At the convent of the Rue du Temple, in particular, which belonged, in truth, to another order, the black shutters were replaced by brown curtains, and the parlor itself was a salon with a polished wood floor, whose windows were draped in white muslin curtains and whose walls admitted all sorts of frames, a portrait of a Benedictine nun with unveiled face, painted bouquets, and even the head of a Turk.\\n\\n It is in that garden of the Temple convent, that stood that famous chestnut-tree which was renowned as the finest and the largest in France, and which bore the reputation among the good people of the eighteenth century of being the father of all the chestnut trees of the realm.\\n\\n As we have said, this convent of the Temple was occupied by Benedictines of the Perpetual Adoration, Benedictines quite different from those who depended on Citeaux. This order of the Perpetual Adoration is not very ancient and does not go back more than two hundred years. In 1649 the holy sacrament was profaned on two occasions a few days apart, in two churches in Paris, at Saint-Sulpice and at Saint-Jean en Greve, a rare and frightful sacrilege which set the whole town in an uproar. M. the Prior and Vicar-General of Saint-Germain des Pres ordered a solemn procession of all his clergy, in which the Pope\u0027s Nuncio officiated. But this expiation did not satisfy two sainted women, Madame Courtin, Marquise de Boucs, and the Comtesse de Chateauvieux. This outrage committed on \"the most holy sacrament of the altar,\" though but temporary, would not depart from these holy souls, and it seemed to them that it could only be extenuated by a \"Perpetual Adoration\" in some female monastery. Both of them, one in 1652, the other in 1653, made donations of notable sums to Mother Catherine de Bar, called of the Holy Sacrament, a Benedictine nun, for the purpose of founding, to this pious end, a monastery of the order of Saint-Benoit; the first permission for this foundation was given to Mother Catherine de Bar by M. de Metz, Abbe of Saint-Germain, \"on condition that no woman could be received unless she contributed three hundred livres income, which amounts to six thousand livres, to the principal.\" After the Abbe of Saint-Germain, the king accorded letters-patent; and all the rest, abbatial charter, and royal letters, was confirmed in 1654 by the Chamber of Accounts and the Parliament.\\n\\n Such is the origin of the legal consecration of the establishment of the Benedictines of the Perpetual Adoration of the Holy Sacrament at Paris. Their first convent was \"a new building\" in the Rue Cassette, out of the contributions of Mesdames de Boucs and de Chateauvieux.\\n\\n This order, as it will be seen, was not to be confounded with the Benedictine nuns of Citeaux. It mounted back to the Abbe of Saint-Germain des Pres, in the same manner that the ladies of the Sacred Heart go back to the general of the Jesuits, and the sisters of charity to the general of the Lazarists.\\n\\n It was also totally different from the Bernardines of the Petit-Picpus, whose interior we have just shown. In 1657, Pope Alexander VII. had authorized, by a special brief, the Bernardines of the Rue Petit-Picpus, to practise the Perpetual Adoration like the Benedictine nuns of the Holy Sacrament. But the two orders remained distinct none the less.\\n\\n 号称法兰西全国最美最大并在十八世纪善良的人民口中誉为“王国一切栗树之父”的那棵印度栗树，正是栽在大庙街上那个修院的园子里的。\\n\\n 我们说过，大庙街上的这座修院是属于永敬会－本笃会的修女的，那里的本笃会修女和隶属于西多的本笃会修女完全是两回事。永敬会的历史并不很久，不会超过两百年。一六四九年，在巴黎的两个礼拜堂里，圣稣尔比斯和格雷沃的圣约翰，圣体曾两次被亵渎，前后两次相隔不过几天，那种少见的渎神罪发生后全城的人都为之骇然。圣日耳曼·德·勃雷的大助理主教兼院长先生传谕给他的全体圣职人员，举行了一次隆重的迎神游行仪式，那次仪式并由罗马教皇的使臣主持。但有两个尊贵的妇人，古尔丹夫人（即布克侯爵夫人）和沙多维安伯爵夫人，感到那样赎罪还不够。那种对“神坛上极其崇高的圣体”所犯的罪行，虽是偶然发生的，但在那两位圣女看来，却认为不该就那样草草了事，她们认为只有在某个女修院里进行“永恒的敬礼”才能补赎。她们俩，一个在一六五二年，一个在一六五三年，为这虔诚的心愿捐款了大笔的钱给一个叫卡特琳·德·巴尔嬷嬷，又名圣体嬷嬷的本笃会修女，要她替圣伯努瓦系创建一个修院。圣日耳曼修院院长梅茨先生首先许可卡特琳·德·巴尔嬷嬷建院，“约定申请入院的女子必须年缴住院费三百利弗，也就是六千利弗的本金，否则不许入院。”继圣日耳曼修院院长之后，国王又颁发了准许状，到一六五四年，修院的许可证和国王的准许状又一并经财务部门和法院通过批准。\\n\\n 这就是本笃会修女们在巴黎建立圣体永敬会的起源和法律根据。她们的第一个修院是用布克夫人和沙多维安夫人的钱在卡塞特街“修建一新”的。\\n\\n 因此我们知道，那个修会绝不能和西多的本笃会修女混为一谈。它隶属于圣日耳曼·德·勃雷的修院院长，正如圣心会的嬷嬷隶属于耶稣会会长，仁慈会的嬷嬷隶属于辣匝禄会会长一样。\\n\\n 它和小比克布斯的伯尔纳修女也完全是另一回事，小比克布斯的内部情况是我们前面已经谈过了的。罗马教皇亚历山大七世在一六五七年有过专牒，准许小比克布斯的伯尔纳修女和圣体会的本笃系的修女一样，修持永敬仪轨。但是那两个修会并不因此而属于同一体系。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4260.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
