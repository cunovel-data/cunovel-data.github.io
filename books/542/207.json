{"id":35794,"no":207,"title":"Part 3 Book 8 Chapter 20 The Trap","content":"The door of the garret had just opened abruptly, and allowed a view of three men clad in blue linen blouses, and masked with masks of black paper. The first was thin, and had a long, iron-tipped cudgel; the second, who was a sort of colossus, carried, by the middle of the handle, with the blade downward, a butcher\u0027s pole-axe for slaughtering cattle. The third, a man with thick-set shoulders, not so slender as the first, held in his hand an enormous key stolen from the door of some prison.　\\n\\n It appeared that the arrival of these men was what Jondrette had been waiting for. A rapid dialogue ensued between him and the man with the cudgel, the thin one.\\n\\n \"Is everything ready?\" said Jondrette.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" replied the thin man.\\n\\n \"Where is Montparnasse?\"\\n\\n \"The young principal actor stopped to chat with your girl.\"\\n\\n \"Which?\"\\n\\n \"The eldest.\"\\n\\n \"Is there a carriage at the door?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Is the team harnessed?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"With two good horses?\"\\n\\n \"Excellent.\"\\n\\n \"Is it waiting where I ordered?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Good,\" said Jondrette.　\\n\\n M. Leblanc was very pale. He was scrutinizing everything around him in the den, like a man who understands what he has fallen into, and his head, directed in turn toward all the heads which surrounded him, moved on his neck with an astonished and attentive slowness, but there was nothing in his air which resembled fear. He had improvised an intrenchment out of the table; and the man, who but an instant previously, had borne merely the appearance of a kindly old man, had suddenly become a sort of athlete, and placed his robust fist on the back of his chair, with a formidable and surprising gesture. 　\\n\\n This old man, who was so firm and so brave in the presence of such a danger, seemed to possess one of those natures which are as courageous as they are kind, both easily and simply. The father of a woman whom we love is never a stranger to us. Marius felt proud of that unknown man.　\\n\\n Three of the men, of whom Jondrette had said: \"They are chimney-builders,\" had armed themselves from the pile of old iron, one with a heavy pair of shears, the second with weighing-tongs, the third with a hammer, and had placed themselves across the entrance without uttering a syllable. The old man had remained on the bed, and had merely opened his eyes. The Jondrette woman had seated herself beside him. 　\\n\\n Marius decided that in a few seconds more the moment for intervention would arrive, and he raised his right hand towards the ceiling, in the direction of the corridor, in readiness to discharge his pistol.　\\n\\n Jondrette having terminated his colloquy with the man with the cudgel, turned once more to M. Leblanc, and repeated his question, accompanying it with that low, repressed, and terrible laugh which was peculiar to him:-- 　\\n\\n \"So you do not recognize me?\"　\\n\\n M. Leblanc looked him full in the face, and replied:--\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n Then Jondrette advanced to the table. He leaned across the candle, crossing his arms, putting his angular and ferocious jaw close to M. Leblanc\u0027s calm face, and advancing as far as possible without forcing M. Leblanc to retreat, and, in this posture of a wild beast who is about to bite, he exclaimed:--\\n\\n \"My name is not Fabantou, my name is not Jondrette, my name is Thenardier. I am the inn-keeper of Montfermeil! Do you understand? Thenardier! Now do you know me?\" 　\\n\\n An almost imperceptible flush crossed M. Leblanc\u0027s brow, and he replied with a voice which neither trembled nor rose above its ordinary level, with his accustomed placidity:--\\n\\n \"No more than before.\"\\n\\n Marius did not hear this reply. Any one who had seen him at that moment through the darkness would have perceived that he was haggard, stupid, thunder-struck. At the moment when Jondrette said: \"My name is Thenardier,\" Marius had trembled in every limb, and had leaned against the wall, as though he felt the cold of a steel blade through his heart. Then his right arm, all ready to discharge the signal shot, dropped slowly, and at the moment when Jondrette repeated, \"Thenardier, do you understand?\" Marius\u0027s faltering fingers had come near letting the pistol fall. Jondrette, by revealing his identity, had not moved M. Leblanc, but he had quite upset Marius. That name of Thenardier, with which M. Leblanc did not seem to be acquainted, Marius knew well. Let the reader recall what that name meant to him! That name he had worn on his heart, inscribed in his father\u0027s testament! He bore it at the bottom of his mind, in the depths of his memory, in that sacred injunction: \"A certain Thenardier saved my life. If my son encounters him, he will do him all the good that lies in his power.\" That name, it will be remembered, was one of the pieties of his soul; he mingled it with the name of his father in his worship. What! This man was that Thenardier, that inn-keeper of Montfermeil whom he had so long and so vainly sought! He had found him at last, and how? His father\u0027s saviour was a ruffian! That man, to whose service Marius was burning to devote himself, was a monster! That liberator of Colonel Pontmercy was on the point of committing a crime whose scope Marius did not, as yet, clearly comprehend, but which resembled an assassination! And against whom, great God! what a fatality! What a bitter mockery of fate! His father had commanded him from the depths of his coffin to do all the good in his power to this Thenardier, and for four years Marius had cherished no other thought than to acquit this debt of his father\u0027s, and at the momes wrath had fallen into some hole, like the Rhone; then, as though he were concluding aloud the things which he had been saying to himself in a whisper, he smote the table with his fist, and shouted:--　\\n\\n \"And with his goody-goody air!\"\\n\\n And, apostrophizing M. Leblanc:--\\n\\n \"Parbleu! You made game of me in the past! You are the cause of all my misfortunes! For fifteen hundred francs you got a girl whom I had, and who certainly belonged to rich people, and who had already brought in a great deal of money, and from whom I might have extracted enough to live on all my life! A girl who would have made up to me for everything that I lost in that vile cook-shop, where there was nothing but one continual row, and where, like a fool, I ate up my last farthing! Oh! I wish all the wine folks drank in my house had been poison to those who drank it! Wen循ㄠve so long worn on his breast his father\u0027s last commands, written in his own hand, only to act in so horribly contrary a sense! But, on the other hand, now look on that trap and not prevent it! Condemn the victim and to spare the assassin! Could one be held to any gratitude towards so miserable a wretch? All the ideas which Marius had cherished for the last four years were pierced through and through, as it were, by this unforeseen blow. \\n\\n He shuddered. Everything depended on him. Unknown to themselves, he held in his hand all those beings who were moving about there before his eyes. If he fired his pistol, M. Leblanc was saved, and Thenardier lost; if he did not fire, M. Leblanc would be sacrificed, and, who knows? Thenardier would escape. Should he dash down the one or allow the other to fall? Remorse awaited him in either case.\\n\\n What was he to do? What should he choose? Be false to the most imperious souvenirs, to all those solemn vows to himself, to the most sacred duty, to the most venerated text! Should he ignore his father\u0027s testament, or allow the perpetration of a crime! On the one hand, it seemed to him that he heard \"his Ursule\" supplicating for her father and on the other, the colonel commending Thenardier to his care. He felt that he was going mad. His knees gave way beneath him. And he had not even the time for deliberation, so great was the fury with which the scene before his eyes was hastening to its catastrophe. It was like a whirlwind of which he had thought himself the master, and which was now sweeping him away. He was on the verge of swooning.　\\n\\n In the meantime, Thenardier, whom we shall henceforth call by no other name, was pacing up and down in front of the table in a sort of frenzy and wild triumph.\\n\\n He seized the candle in his fist, and set it on the chimney-piece with so violent a bang that the wick came near being extinguished, and the tallow bespattered the wall.\\n\\n Then he turned to M. Leblanc with a horrible look, and spit out these words:--\\n\\n \"Done for! Smoked brown! Cooked! Spitchcocked!\" 　\\n\\n And again he began to march back and forth, in full eruption.\\n\\n \"Ah!\" he cried, \"so I\u0027ve found you again at last, Mister philanthropist! Mister threadbare millionnaire! Mister giver of dolls! you old ninny! Ah! so you don\u0027t recognize me! No, it wasn\u0027t you who came to Montfermeil, to my inn, eight years ago, on Christmas eve, 1823! It wasn\u0027t you who carried off that Fantine\u0027s child from me! The Lark! It wasn\u0027t you who had a yellow great-coat! No! Nor a package of duds in your hand, as you had this morning here! Say, wife, it seems to be his mania to carry packets of woollen stockings into houses! Old charity monger, get out with you! Are you a hosier, Mister millionnaire? You give away your stock in trade to the poor, holy man! What bosh! merry Andrew! Ah! and you don\u0027t recognize me? Well, I recognize you, that I do! I recognized you the very moment you poked your snout in here. Ah! you\u0027ll find out presently, that it isn\u0027t all roses to thrust yourself in that fashion into people\u0027s houses, under the pretext that they are taverns, in wretched clothes, with the air of a poor man, to whom one would give a sou, to deceive persons, to play the generous, to take away their means of livelihood, and to make threats in the woods, and you can\u0027t call things quits because afterwards, when people are ruined, you bring a coat that is too large, and two miserable hospital blankets, you old blackguard, you child-stealer!\" 　\\n\\n He paused, and seemed to be talking to himself for a moment. One would have said that his wrath had fallen into some hole, like the Rhone; then, as though he were concluding aloud the things which he had been saying to himself in a whisper, he smote the table with his fist, and shouted:--　\\n\\n \"And with his goody-goody air!\"\\n\\n And, apostrophizing M. Leblanc:--\\n\\n \"Parbleu! You made game of me in the past! You are the cause of all my misfortunes! For fifteen hundred francs you got a girl whom I had, and who certainly belonged to rich people, and who had already brought in a great deal of money, and from whom I might have extracted enough to live on all my life! A girl who would have made up to me for everything that I lost in that vile cook-shop, where there was nothing but one continual row, and where, like a fool, I ate up my last farthing! Oh! I wish all the wine folks drank in my house had been poison to those who drank it! Well, never mind! Say, now! You must have thought me ridiculous when you went off with the Lark! You had your cudgel in the forest. You were the stronger. Revenge. I\u0027m the one to hold the trumps to-day! You\u0027re in a sorry case, my good fellow! Oh, but I can laugh! Really, I laugh! Didn\u0027t he fall into the trap! I told him that I was an actor, that my name was Fabantou, that I had played comedy with Mamselle Mars, with Mamselle Muche, that my landlord insisted on being paid tomorrow, the 4th of February, and he didn\u0027t even notice that the 8th of January, and not the 4th of February is the time when the quarter runs out! Absurd idiot! And the four miserable Philippes which he has brought me! Scoundrel! He hadn\u0027t the heart even to go as high as a hundred francs! And how he swallowed my platitudes! That did amuse me. I said to myself: `Blockhead! Come, I\u0027ve got you! I lick your paws this morning,but I\u0027ll gnaw your heart this evening!\u0027\"　\\n\\n Thenardier paused. He was out of breath. His little, narrow chest panted like a forge bellows. His eyes were full of the ignoble happiness of a feeble, cruel, and cowardly creature, which finds that it can, at last, harass what it has feared, and insult what it has flattered, the joy of a dwarf who should be able to set his heel on the head of Goliath, the joy of a jackal which is beginning to rend a sick bull, so nearly dead that he can no longer defend himself, but sufficiently alive to suffer still. 　\\n\\n M. Leblanc did not interrupt him, but said to him when he paused:--\\n\\n \"I do not know what you mean to say. You are mistaken in me. I am a very poor man, and anything but a millionnaire. I do not know you. You are mistaking me for some other person.\"\\n\\n \"Ah!\" roared Thenardier hoarsely, \"a pretty lie! You stick to that pleasantry, do you! You\u0027re floundering, my old buck! Ah! You don\u0027t remember! You don\u0027t see who I am?\"\\n\\n \"Excuse me, sir,\" said M. Leblanc with a politeness of accent, which at that moment seemed peculiarly strange and powerful, \"I see that you are a villain!\"\\n\\n Who has not remarked the fact that odious creatures possess a susceptibility of their own, that monsters are ticklish! At this word \"villain,\" the female Thenardier sprang from the bed, Thenardier grasped his chair as though he were about to crush it in his hands. \"Don\u0027t you stir!\" he shouted to his wife; and, turning to M. Leblanc:--　\\n\\n \"Villain! Yes, I know that you call us that, you rich gentlemen! Stop! it\u0027s true that I became bankrupt, that I am in hiding, that I have no bread, that I have not a single sou, that I am a villain! It\u0027s three days since I have had anything to eat, so I\u0027m a villain! Ah! you folks warm your feet, you have Sakoski boots, you have wadded great-coats, like archbishops, you lodge on the first floor in houses that have porters, you eat truffles, you eat asparagus at forty francs the bunch in the month of January, and green peas, you gorge yourselves, and when you want to know whether it is cold, you look in the papers to see what the engineer Chevalier\u0027s thermometer says about it. We, it is we who are thermometers. We don\u0027t need to go out and look on the quay at the corner of the Tour de l\u0027Horologe, to find out the number of degrees of cold; we feel our blood congealing in our veins, and the ice forming round our hearts, and we say: `There is no God!\u0027 And you come to our caverns, yes our caverns, for the purpose of calling us villains! But we\u0027ll devour you! But we\u0027ll devour you, poor little things! Just see here, Mister millionnaire: I have been a solid man, I have held a license, I have been an elector, I am a bourgeois, that I am! And it\u0027s quite possible that you are not!\" 　\\n\\n Here Thenardier took a step towards the men who stood near the door, and added with a shudder:--\\n\\n \"When I think that he has dared to come here and talk to me like a cobbler!\"\\n\\n Then addressing M. Leblanc with a fresh outburst of frenzy:--\\n\\n \"And listen to this also, Mister philanthropist! I\u0027m not a suspicious character, not a bit of it! I\u0027m not a man whose name nobody knows, and who comes and abducts children from houses! I\u0027m an old French soldier, I ought to have been decorated! I was at Waterloo, so I was! And in the battle I saved a general called the Comte of I don\u0027t know what. He told me his name, but his beastly voice was so weak that I didn\u0027t hear. All I caught was Merci [thanks]. I\u0027d rather have had his name than his thanks. That would have helped me to find him again. The picture that you see here, and which was painted by David at Bruqueselles,--do you know what it represents? It represents me. David wished to immortalize that feat of prowess. I have that general on my back, and I am carrying him through the grape-shot. There\u0027s the history of it! That general never did a single thing for me; he was no better than the rest! But none the less, I saved his life at the risk of my own, and I have the certificate of the fact in my pocket! I am a soldier of Waterloo, by all the furies! And now that I have had the goodness to tell you all this, let\u0027s have an end of it. I want money, I want a deal of money, I must have an enormous lot of money, or I\u0027ll exterminate you, by the thunder of the good God!\"\\n\\n Marius had regained some measure of control over his anguish, and was listening. The last possibility of doubt had just vanished. It certainly was the Thenardier of the will. Marius shuddered at that reproach of ingratitude directed against his father, and which he was on the point of so fatally justifying. His perplexity was redoubled.\\n\\n Moreover, there was in all these words of Thenardier, in his accent, in his gesture, in his glance which darted flames at every word, there was, in this explosion of an evil nature disclosing everything, in that mixture of braggadocio and abjectness, of pride and pettiness,of rage and folly, in that chaos of real griefs and false sentiments, in that immodesty of a malicious man tasting the voluptuous delights of violence, in that shameless nudity of a repulsive soul, in that conflagration of all sufferings combined with all hatreds, something which was as hideous as evil, and as heart-rending as the truth.\\n\\n The picture of the master, the painting by David which he had proposed that M. Leblanc should purchase, was nothing else, as the reader has divined, than the sign of his tavern painted, as it will be remembered, by himself, the only relic which he had preserved from his shipwreck at Montfermeil.　\\n\\n As he had ceased to intercept Marius\u0027 visual ray, Marius could examine this thing, and in the daub, he actually did recognize a battle, a background of smoke, and a man carrying another man.It was the group composed of Pontmercy and Thenardier; the sergeant the rescuer, the colonel rescued. Marius was like a drunken man; this picture restored his father to life in some sort; it was no longer the signboard of the wine-shop at Montfermeil, it was a resurrection;a tomb had yawned, a phantom had risen there. Marius heard his heart beating in his temples, he had the cannon of Waterloo in his ears, his bleeding father, vaguely depicted on that sinister panel terrified him, and it seemed to him that the misshapen spectre was gazing intently at him.　\\n\\n When Thenardier had recovered his breath, he turned his bloodshot eyes on M. Leblanc, and said to him in a low, curt voice:--　\\n\\n \"What have you to say before we put the handcuffs on you?\"\\n\\n M. Leblanc held his peace.\\n\\n In the midst of this silence, a cracked voice launched this lugubrious sarcasm from the corridor:--　\\n\\n \"If there\u0027s any wood to be split, I\u0027m there!\"\\n\\n It was the man with the axe, who was growing merry.\\n\\n At the same moment, an enormous, bristling, and clayey face made its appearance at the door, with a hideous laugh which exhibited not teeth, but fangs.\\n\\n It was the face of the man with the butcher\u0027s axe.\\n\\n \"Why have you taken off your mask\u003e \\n\\n Thenardier put the handkerchief into his own pocket.\\n\\n \"What! No pocket-book?\" he demanded.\\n\\n \"No, nor watch,\" replied one of the \"chimney-builders.\"\\n\\n \"Never mind,\" murmured the masked man who carried the big key,in the voice of a ventriloquist, \"he\u0027s a tough old fellow.\"　\\n\\n Thenardier went to the corner near the door, picked up a bundle of ropes and threw them at the men.　\\n\\n \"Tie him to the leg of the bed,\" said he.\\n\\n And, catching sight of the old man who had been stretched across the room by the blow from M. Leblanc\u0027s fist, and who made no movement, he added:--\\n\\n \"Is Boulatruelle dead?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" replied Bigrenaille, \"he\u0027s drunk.\"篜t?He was half out when six robust fists seized him and dragged him back energetically into the hovel. These were the three \"chimney-builders,\" who had flung themselves upon him. At the same time the Thenardier woman had wound her hands in his hair.\\n\\n At the trampling which ensued, the other ruffians rushed up from the corridor. The old man on the bed, who seemed under the influence of wine, descended from the pallet and came reeling up,with a stone-breaker\u0027s hammer in his hand.\\n\\n One of the \"chimney-builders,\" whose smirched face was lighted up by the candle, and in whom Marius recognized, in spite of his daubing, Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, lifted above M. Leblanc\u0027s head a sort of bludgeon made of two balls of lead, at the two ends of a bar of iron. 　\\n\\n Marius could not resist this sight. \"My father,\" he thought, \"forgive me!\"\\n\\n And his finger sought the trigger of his pistol.\\n\\n The shot was on the point of being discharged when Thenardier\u0027svoice shouted:--\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t harm him!\"\\n\\n This desperate attempt of the victim, far from exasperating Thenardier,had calmed him. There existed in him two men, the ferocious man and the adroit man. Up to that moment, in the excess of his triumph in the presence of the prey which had been brought down, and which did not stir, the ferocious man had prevailed; when the victim struggled and tried to resist, the adroit man reappeared and took the upper hand.　\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t hurt him!\" he repeated, and without suspecting it, his first success was to arrest the pistol in the act of being discharged, and to paralyze Marius, in whose opinion the urgency of the case disappeared, and who, in the face of this new phase, saw no inconvenience in waiting a while longer. \\n\\n Who knows whether some chance would not arise which would deliver him from the horrible alternative of allowing Ursule\u0027s father to perish, or of destroying the colonel\u0027s saviour?\\n\\n A herculean struggle had begun. With one blow full in the chest, M. Leblanc had sent the old man tumbling, rolling in the middle of the room, then with two backward sweeps of his hand he had overthrown two more assailants, and he held one under each of his knees; the wretches were rattling in the throat beneath this pressure as under a granite millstone; but the other four had seized the formidable old man by both arms and the back of his neck, and were holding him doubled up over the two \"chimney-builders\" on the floor.\\n\\n Thus, the master of some and mastered by the rest, crushing those beneath him and stifling under those on top of him, endeavoring in vain to shake off all the efforts which were heaped upon him, M. Leblanc disappeared under the horrible group of ruffians like the wild boar beneath a howling pile of dogs and hounds. 　\\n\\n They succeeded in overthrowing him upon the bed nearest the window,and there they held him in awe. The Thenardier woman had not released her clutch on his hair.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you mix yourself up in this affair,\" said Thenardier. \"You\u0027ll tear your shawl.\"\\n\\n The Thenardier obeyed, as the female wolf obeys the male wolf,with a growl.\\n\\n \"Now,\" said Thenardier, \"search him, you other fellows!\" \\n\\n M. Leblanc seemed to have renounced the idea of resistance.\\n\\n They searched him.\\n\\n He had nothing on his person except a leather purse containing six francs, and his handkerchief.　\\n\\n Thenardier put the handkerchief into his own pocket.\\n\\n \"What! No pocket-book?\" he demanded.\\n\\n \"No, nor watch,\" replied one of the \"chimney-builders.\"\\n\\n \"Never mind,\" murmured the masked man who carried the big key,in the voice of a ventriloquist, \"he\u0027s a tough old fellow.\"　\\n\\n Thenardier went to the corner near the door, picked up a bundle of ropes and threw them at the men.　\\n\\n \"Tie him to the leg of the bed,\" said he.\\n\\n And, catching sight of the old man who had been stretched across the room by the blow from M. Leblanc\u0027s fist, and who made no movement, he added:--\\n\\n \"Is Boulatruelle dead?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" replied Bigrenaille, \"he\u0027s drunk.\"\\n\\n \"Sweep him into a corner,\" said Thenardier.\\n\\n Two of the \"chimney-builders\" pushed the drunken man into the corner near the heap of old iron with their feet.　\\n\\n \"Babet,\" said Thenardier in a low tone to the man with the cudgel, \"why did you bring so many; they were not needed.\"\\n\\n \"What can you do?\" replied the man with the cudgel, \"they all wanted to be in it. This is a bad season. There\u0027s no business going on.\" 　\\n\\n The pallet on which M. Leblanc had been thrown was a sort of hospital bed, elevated on four coarse wooden legs, roughly hewn.　\\n\\n M. Leblanc let them take their own course.\\n\\n The ruffians bound him securely, in an upright attitude, with his feet on the ground at the head of the bed, the end which was most remote from the window, and nearest to the fireplace.\\n\\n When the last knot had been tied, Thenardier took a chair and seated himself almost facing M. Leblanc.　\\n\\n Thenardier no longer looked like himself; in the course of a few moments his face had passed from unbridled violence to tranquil and cunning sweetness.\\n\\n Marius found it difficult to recognize in that polished smile of a man in official life the almost bestial mouth which had been foaming but a moment before; he gazed with amazement on that fantastic and alarming metamorphosis, and he felt as a man might feel who should behold a tiger converted into a lawyer.\\n\\n \"Monsieur--\" said Thenardier.\\n\\n And dismissing with a gesture the ruffians who still kept their hands on M. Leblanc:--\\n\\n \"Stand off a little, and let me have a talk with the gentleman.\" 　\\n\\n All retired towards the door.　\\n\\n He went on:--\\n\\n \"Monsieur, you did wrong to try to jump out of the window. You might have broken your leg. Now, if you will permit me, we will converse quietly. In the first place, I must communicate to you an observation which I have made which is, that you have not uttered the faintest cry.\"\\n\\n Thenardier was right, this detail was correct, although it had escaped Marius in his agitation. M. Leblanc had barely pronounced a few words, without raising his voice, and even during his struggle with the six ruffians near the window he had preserved the most profound and singular silence.\\n\\n Thenardier continued:--\\n\\n \"Mon Dieu! You might have shouted `stop thief\u0027 a bit, and I should not have thought it improper. `Murder!\u0027 That, too, is said occasionally, and, so far as I am concerned, I should not have taken it in bad part. It is very natural that you should make a little row when you find yourself with persons who don\u0027t inspire you with sufficient confidence. You might have done that, and no one would have troubled you on that account. You would not even have been gagged. And I will tell you why. This room is very private. That\u0027s its only recommendation, but it has that in its favor. You might fire off a mortar and it would produce about as much noise at the nearest police station as the snores of a drunken man. Here a cannon would make a boum, and the thunder would make a pouf.It\u0027s a handy lodging. But, in short, you did not shout, and it is better so. I present you my compliments, and I will tell you the conclusion that I draw from that fact: My dear sir, when a man shouts, who comes? The police. And after the police? Justice. Well! You have not made an outcry; that is because you don\u0027t care to have the police and the courts come in any more than we do. It is because,--I have long suspected it,--you have some interest in hiding something. On our side we have the same interest. So we can come to an understanding.\"\\n\\n As he spoke thus, it seemed as though Thenardier, who kept his eyes fixed on M. Leblanc, were trying to plunge the sharp points which darted from the pupils into the very conscience of his prisoner. Moreover, his language, which was stamped with a sort of moderated,subdued insolence and crafty insolence, was reserved and almost choice,and in that rascal, who had been nothing but a robber a short time previously, one now felt \"the man who had studied for the priesthood.\"\\n\\n The silence preserved by the prisoner, that precaution which had been carried to the point of forgetting all anxiety for his own life, that resistance opposed to the first impulse of nature,which is to utter a cry, all this, it must be confessed,now that his attention had been called to it, troubled Marius,and affected him with painful astonishment.\\n\\n Thenardier\u0027s well-grounded observation still further obscured for Marius the dense mystery which enveloped that grave and singular person on whom Courfeyrac had bestowed the sobriquet of Monsieur Leblanc.\\n\\n But whoever he was, bound with ropes, surrounded with executioners, half plunged, so to speak, in a grave which was closing in upon him to the extent of a degree with every moment that passed, in the presence of Thenardier\u0027s wrath, as in the presence of his sweetness, this man remained impassive; and Marius could not refrain from admiring at such a moment the superbly melancholy visage.　\\n\\n Here, evidently, was a soul which was inaccessible to terror, and which did not know the meaning of despair. Here was one of those men who command amazement in desperate circumstances. Extreme as was the crisis, inevitable as was the catastrophe,there was nothing here of the agony of the drowning man, who opens his horror-filled eyes under the water.\\n\\n Thenardier rose in an unpretending manner, went to the fireplace, shoved aside the screen, which he leaned against the neighboring pallet, and thus unmasked the brazier full of glowing coals, in which the prisoner could plainly see the chisel white-hot and spotted here and there with tiny scarlet stars. 　\\n\\n Then Thenardier returned to his seat beside M. Leblanc. 　\\n\\n \"I continue,\" said he. \"We can come to an understanding. Let us arrange this matter in an amicable way. I was wrong to lose my temper just now, I don\u0027t know what I was thinking of, I went a great deal too far, I said extravagant things. For example,because you are a millionnaire, I told you that I exacted money,a lot of money, a deal of money. That would not be reasonable.Mon Dieu, in spite of your riches, you have expenses of your own--who has not? I don\u0027t want to ruin you, I am not a greedy fellow,after all. I am not one of those people who, because they have the advantage of the position, profit by the fact to make themselves ridiculous. Why, I\u0027m taking things into consideration and making a sacrifice on my side. I only want two hundred thousand francs.\"\\n\\n M. Leblanc uttered not a word.\\n\\n Thenardier went on:--\\n\\n \"You see that I put not a little water in my wine; I\u0027m very moderate. I don\u0027t know the state of your fortune, but I do know that you don\u0027t stick at money, and a benevolent man like yourself can certainly give two hundred thousand francs to the father of a family who is out of luck. Certainly, you are reasonable, too; you haven\u0027t imagined that I should take all the trouble I have to-day and organized this affair this evening, which has been labor well bestowed, in the opinion of these gentlemen, merely to wind up by asking you for enough to go and drink red wine at fifteen sous and eat veal at Desnoyer\u0027s. Two hundred thousand francs--it\u0027s surely worth all that. This trifle once out of your pocket, I guarantee you that that\u0027s the end of the matter, and that you have no further demands to fear. You will say to me: `But I haven\u0027t two hundred thousand francs about me.\u0027 Oh! I\u0027m not extortionate. I don\u0027t demand that. I only ask one thing of you. Have the goodness to write what I am about to dictate to you.\"\\n\\n Here Thenardier paused; then he added, emphasizing his words,and casting a smile in the direction of the brazier:--　\\n\\n \"I warn you that I shall not admit that you don\u0027t know how to write.\"\\n\\n A grand inquisitor might have envied that smile.\\n\\n Thenardier pushed the table close to M. Leblanc, and took an inkstand, a pen, and a sheet of paper from the drawer which he left half open, and in which gleamed the long blade of the knife.　\\n\\n He placed the sheet of paper before M. Leblanc.\\n\\n \"Write,\" said he.\\n\\n The prisoner spoke at last.\\n\\n \"How do you expect me to write? I am bound.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s true, excuse me!\" ejaculated Thenardier, \"you are quite right.\"\\n\\n And turning to Bigrenaille:--\\n\\n \"Untie the gentleman\u0027s right arm.\"\\n\\n Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, executed Thenardier\u0027s order.\\n\\n When the prisoner\u0027s right arm was free, Thenardier dipped the pen in the ink and presented it to him.　\\n\\n \"Understand thoroughly, sir, that you are in our power, at our discretion, that no human power can get you out of this, and that we shall be really grieved if we are forced to proceed to disagreeable extremities. I know neither your name, nor your address, but I warn you, that you will remain bound until the person charged with carrying the letter which you are about to write shall have returned. Now, be so good as to write.\"　\\n\\n \"What?\" demanded the prisoner.\\n\\n \"I will dictate.\"\\n\\n M. Leblanc took the pen.\\n\\n Thenardier began to dictate:--\\n\\n \"My daughter--\"\\n\\n The prisoner shuddered, and raised his eyes to Thenardier.\\n\\n \"Put down `My dear daughter\u0027--\" said Thenardier.\\n\\n M. Leblanc obeyed.\\n\\n Thenardier continued:--\\n\\n \"Come instantly--\"\\n\\n He paused:--\\n\\n \"You address her as thou, do you not?\"\\n\\n \"Who?\" asked M. Leblanc.\\n\\n \"Parbleu!\" cried Thenardier, \"the little one, the Lark.\"\\n\\n M. Leblanc replied without the slightest apparent emotion:--\\n\\n \"I do not know what you mean.\"\\n\\n \"Go on, nevertheless,\" ejaculated Thenardier, and he continued to dictate:--\\n\\n \"Come immediately, I am in absolute need of thee. The person who will deliver this note to thee is instructed to conduct thee to me.I am waiting for thee. Come with confidence.\"\\n\\n M. Leblanc had written the whole of this.\\n\\n Thenardier resumed:--\\n\\n \"Ah! erase `come with confidence\u0027; that might lead her to suppose that everything was not as it should be, and that distrust is possible.\"\\n\\n M. Leblanc erased the three words.\\n\\n \"Now,\" pursued Thenardier, \"sign it. What\u0027s your name?\"\\n\\n The prisoner laid down the pen and demanded:--\\n\\n \"For whom is this letter?\"\\n\\n \"You know well,\" retorted Thenardier, \"for the little one I just told you so.\"\\n\\n It was evident that Thenardier avoided naming the young girl in question. He said \"the Lark,\" he said \"the little one,\" but he did not pronounce her name--the precaution of a clever man guarding his secret from his accomplices. To mention the name was to deliver the whole \"affair\" into their hands, and to tell them more about it than there was any need of their knowing.\\n\\n He went on:-- \\n\\n \"Sign. What is your name?\"\\n\\n \"Urbain Fabre,\" said the prisoner.\\n\\n Thenardier, with the movement of a cat, dashed his hand into his pocket and drew out the handkerchief which had been seized on M. Leblanc. He looked for the mark on it, and held it close to the candle.\\n\\n \"U. F. That\u0027s it. Urbain Fabre. Well, sign it U. F.\"\\n\\n The prisoner signed.\\n\\n \"As two hands are required to fold the letter, give it to me, I will fold it.\"\\n\\n That done, Thenardier resumed:--\\n\\n \"Address it, `Mademoiselle Fabre,\u0027 at your house. I know that you live a long distance from here, near Saint-Jacquesdu-Haut-Pas, because you go to mass there every day, but I don\u0027t know in what street. I see that you understand your situation. As you have not lied about your name, you will not lie about your address. Write it yourself.\" 　\\n\\n The prisoner paused thoughtfully for a moment, then he took the pen and wrote:--\\n\\n \"Mademoiselle Fabre, at M. Urbain Fabre\u0027s, Rue Saint-Dominique-D\u0027Enfer, No. 17.\"\\n\\n Thenardier seized the letter with a sort of feverish convulsion.\\n\\n \"Wife!\" he cried.\\n\\n The Thenardier woman hastened to him.\\n\\n \"Here\u0027s the letter. You know what you have to do. There is a carriage at the door. Set out at once, and return ditto.\"\\n\\n And addressing the man with the meat-axe:--\\n\\n \"Since you have taken off your nose-screen, accompany the mistress. You will get up behind the fiacre. You know where you left the team?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said the man.\\n\\n And depositing his axe in a corner, he followed Madame Thenardier.\\n\\n As they set off, Thenardier thrust his head through the half-open door, and shouted into the corridor:--　\\n\\n \"Above all things, don\u0027t lose the letter! remember that you carry two hundred thousand francs with you!\"\\n\\n The Thenardier\u0027s hoarse voice replied:--\\n\\n \"Be easy. I have it in my bosom.\"\\n\\n A minute had not elapsed, when the sound of the cracking of a whip was heard, which rapidly retreated and died away.\\n\\n \"Good!\" growled Thenardier. \"They\u0027re going at a fine pace. At such a gallop, the bourgeoise will be back inside three-quarters of an hour.\"\\n\\n He drew a chair close to the fireplace, folding his arms, and presenting his muddy boots to the brazier.　\\n\\n \"My feet are cold!\" said he.\\n\\n Only five ruffians now remained in the den with Thenardier and the prisoner.\\n\\n These men, through the black masks or paste which covered their faces, and made of them, at fear\u0027s pleasure, charcoal-burners, negroes, or demons, had a stupid and gloomy air, and it could be felt that they perpetrated a crime like a bit of work, tranquilly, without either wrath or mercy, witess, be out of reach with the young girl, and Marius reflected on Thenardier\u0027s words, of which he perceived the bloody significance: \"If you have me arrested, my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the Lark.\"\\n\\n Now, it was not alone by the colonel\u0027s testament, it was by his own love, it was by the peril of the one he loved, that he felt himself restrained.\\n\\n This frightful situation, which had already lasted above half an hour, was changing its aspect every moment.　\\n\\n Marius had sufficient strength of mind to review in succession all the most heart-breaking conjectures, seeking hope and finding none. 　\\n\\n Who was this \"little one\" whom Thenardier had called the Lark? Was she his \"Ursule\"? The prisoner had not seemed to be affected by that word, \"the Lark,\" and had replied in the most natural manner in the world: \"I do not know what you mean.\" On the other hand, the two letters U. F. were explained; they meant Urbain Fabre; and Ursule was no longer named Ursule. This was what Marius perceived most clearly of all.\\n\\n A sort of horrible fascination held him nailed to his post, from which he was observing and commanding this whole scene. There he stood, almost incapable of movement or reflection, as though annihilated by the abominable things viewed at such close quarters. He waited, in the hope of some incident, no matter of what nature, since he could not collect his thoughts and did not know upon what course to decide.\\n\\n \"In any case,\" he said, \"if she is the Lark, I shall see her, for the Thenardier woman is to bring her hither. That will be the end, and then I will give my life and my blood if necessary,but I will deliver her! Nothing shall stop me.\"\\n\\n Nearly half an hour passed in this manner. Thenardier seemed to be absorbed in gloomy reflections, the prisoner did not stir. Still, Marius fancied that at intervals, and for the last few moments, he had heard a faint, dull noise in the direction of the prisoner.\\n\\n All at once, Thenardier addressed the prisoner:\\n\\n \"By the way, Monsieur Fabre, I might as well say it to you at once.\"\\n\\n These few words appeared to be the beginning of an explanation. Marius strained his ears.\\n\\n \"My wife will be back shortly, don\u0027t get impatient. I think that the Lark really is your daughter, and it seems to me quite natural that you should keep her. Only, listen to me a bit. My wife will go and hunt her up with your letter. I told my wife to dress herself in the way she did, so that your young lady might make no difficulty about following her. They will both enter the carriage with my comrade behind. Somewhere, outside the barrier, there is a trap harnessed to two very good horses. Your young lady will be taken to it. She will alight from the fiacre. My comrade will enter the other vehicle with her, and my wife will come back here to tell us: `It\u0027s done.\u0027 As for the young lady, no harm will be done to her; the trap will conduct her to a place where she will be quiet, and just as soon as you have handed over to me those little two hundred thousand francs, she will be returned to you. If you have me arrested, my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the Lark, that\u0027s all.\"\\n\\n The prisoner uttered not a syllable. After a pause, Thenardier continued:--\\n\\n \"It\u0027s very simple, as you see. There\u0027ll be no harm done unless you wish that there should be harm done. I\u0027m telling you how things stand. I warn you so that you may be prepared.\"\\n\\n He paused: the prisoner did not break the silence, and Thenardier resumed:--\\n\\n \"As soon as my wife returns and says to me: `The Lark is on the way,\u0027 we will release you, and you will be free to go and sleep at home. You see that our intentions are not evil.\"\\n\\n Terrible images passed through Marius\u0027 mind. What! That young girl whom they were abducting was not to be brought back? One of those monsters was to bear her off into the darkness? Whither? And what if it were she!　\\n\\n It was clear that it was she. Marius felt his heart stop beating.\\n\\n What was he to do? Discharge the pistol? Place all those scoundrels in the hands of justice? But the horrible man with the meat-axe would, none the less, be out of reach with the young girl, and Marius reflected on Thenardier\u0027s words, of which he perceived the bloody significance: \"If you have me arrested, my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the Lark.\"\\n\\n Now, it was not alone by the colonel\u0027s testament, it was by his own love, it was by the peril of the one he loved, that he felt himself restrained.\\n\\n This frightful situation, which had already lasted above half an hour, was changing its aspect every moment.　\\n\\n Marius had sufficient strength of mind to review in succession all the most heart-breaking conjectures, seeking hope and finding none. 　\\n\\n The tumult of his thoughts contrasted with the funereal silence of the den.\\n\\n In the midst of this silence, the door at the bottom of the staircase was heard to open and shut again.　\\n\\n The prisoner made a movement in his bonds.\\n\\n \"Here\u0027s the bourgeoise,\" said Thenardier.\\n\\n He had hardly uttered the words, when the Thenardier woman did in fact rush hastily into the room, red, panting, breathless, with flaming eyes, and cried, as she smote her huge hands on her thighs simultaneously:--　\\n\\n \"False address!\"\\n\\n The ruffian who had gone with her made his appearance behind her and picked up his axe again.\\n\\n She resumed:--\\n\\n \"Nobody there! Rue Saint-Dominique, No. 17, no Monsieur Urbain Fabre! They know not what it means!\"　\\n\\n She paused, choking, then went on:--\\n\\n \"Monsieur Thenardier! That old fellow has duped you! You are too good, you see! If it had been me, I\u0027d have chopped the beast in four quarters to begin with! And if he had acted ugly, I\u0027d have boiled him alive! He would have been obliged to speak, and say where the girl is, and where he keeps his shiners! That\u0027s the way I should have managed matters! People are perfectly right when they say that men are a deal stupider than women! Nobody at No. 17. It\u0027s nothing but a big carriage gate! No Monsieur Fabre in the Rue Saint-Dominique! And after all that racing and fee to the coachman and all! I spoke to both the porter and the portress, a fine, stout woman, and they know nothing about him!\" 　\\n\\n Marius breathed freely once more.　\\n\\n She, Ursule or the Lark, he no longer knew what to call her, was safe.\\n\\n While his exasperated wife vociferated, Thenardier had seated himself on the table.\\n\\n For several minutes he uttered not a word, but swung his right foot, which hung down, and stared at the brazier with an air of savage revery.　\\n\\n Finally, he said to the prisoner, with a slow and singularly ferocious tone:\\n\\n \"A false address? What did you expect to gain by that?\"\\n\\n \"To gain time!\" cried the prisoner in a thundering voice,and at the same instant he shook off his bonds; they were cut. The prisoner was only attached to the bed now by one leg.\\n\\n Before the seven men had time to collect their senses and dash forward, he had bent down into the fireplace, had stretched out his hand to the brazier, and had then straightened himself up again, and now Thenardier, the female Thenardier, and the ruffians, huddled in amazement at the extremity of the hovel, stared at him in stupefaction, as almost free and in a formidable attitude, he brandished above his head the red-hot chisel, which emitted a threatening glow.\\n\\n The judicial examination to which the ambush in the Gorbeau house eventually gave rise, established the fact that a large sou piece, cut and worked in a peculiar fashion, was found in the garret, when the police made their descent on it. This sou piece was one of those marvels of industry, which are engendered by the patience of the galleys in the shadows and for the shadows, marvels which are nothing else than instruments of escape. These hideous and delicate products of wonderful art are to jewellers\u0027 work what the metaphors of slang are to poetry. There are Benvenuto Cellinis in the galleys, just as there are Villons in language. The unhappy wretch who aspires to deliverance finds means sometimes without tools, sometimes with a common wooden-handled knife, to saw a sou into two thin plates, to hollow out these plates without affecting the coinage stamp, and to make a furrow on the edge of the sou in such a manner that the plates will adhere again. This can be screwed together and unscrewed at will; it is a box. In this box he hides a watch-spring, and this watch-spring, properly handled, cuts good-sized chains and bars of iron. The unfortunate convict is supposed to possess merely a sou; not at all,he possesses liberty. It was a large sou of this sort which, during the subsequent search of the police, was found under the bed near the window. They also found a tiny saw of blue steel which would fit the sou.\\n\\n It is probable that the prisoner had this sou piece on his person at the moment when the ruffians searched him, that he contrived to conceal it in his hand, and that afterward, having his right hand free, he unscrewed it, and used it as a saw to cut the cords which fastened him, which would explain the faint noise and almost imperceptible movements which Marius had observed. 　\\n\\n As he had not been able to bend down, for fear of betraying himself, he had not cut the bonds of his left leg.　\\n\\n The ruffians had recovered from their first surprise. 　\\n\\n \"Be easy,\" said Bigrenaille to Thenardier. \"He still holds by one leg, and he can\u0027t get away. I\u0027ll answer for that. I tied that paw for him.\"\\n\\n In the meanwhile, the prisoner had begun to speak:--\\n\\n \"You are wretches, but my life is not worth the trouble of defending it. When you think that you can make me speak, that you can make me write what I do not choose to write, that you can make me say what I do not choose to say--\"　\\n\\n He stripped up his left sleeve, and added:--\\n\\n \"See here.\"　\\n\\n At the same moment he extended his arm, and laid the glowing chisel which he held in his left hand by its wooden handle on his bare flesh.　\\n\\n The crackling of the burning flesh became audible, and the odor peculiar to chambers of torture filled the hovel.　\\n\\n Marius reeled in utter horror, the very ruffians shuddered, hardly a muscle of the old man\u0027s face contracted, and while the red-hot iron sank into the smoking wound, impassive and almost august, he fixed on Thenardier his beautiful glance, in which there was no hatred, and where suffering vanished in serene majesty. 　\\n\\n With grand and lofty natures, the revolts of the flesh and the senses when subjected to physical suffering cause the soul to spring forth, and make it appear on the brow, just as rebellions among the soldiery force the captain to show himself.\\n\\n \"Wretches!\" said he, \"have no more fear of me than I have for you!\"\\n\\n And, tearing the chisel from the wound, he hurled it through the window, which had been left open; the horrible, glowing tool disappeared into the night, whirling as it flew, and fell far away on the snow.　\\n\\n The prisoner resumed:--\\n\\n \"Do what you please with me.\" He was disarmed.\\n\\n \"Seize him!\" said Thenardier.\\n\\n Two of the ruffians laid their hands on his shoulder, and the masked man with the ventriloquist\u0027s voice took up his station in front of him, ready to smash his skull at the slightest movement.　\\n\\n At the same time, Marius heard below him, at the base of the partition, but so near that he could not see who was speaking, this colloquy conducted in a low tone:--\\n\\n \"There is only one thing left to do.\"\\n\\n \"Cut his throat.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s it.\"\\n\\n It was the husband and wife taking counsel together.\\n\\n Thenardier walked slowly towards the table, opened the drawer, and took out the knife. Marius fretted with the handle of his pistol. Unprecedented perplexity! For the last hour he had had two voices in his conscience, the one enjoining him to respect his father\u0027s testament, the other crying to him to rescue the prisoner. These two voices continued uninterruptedly that struggle which tormented him to agony. Up to that moment he had cherished a vague hope that he should find some means of reconciling these two duties, but nothing within the limits of possibility had presented itself.\\n\\n However, the per/home/h3-08.htm\"\u003econtents \\n\\n previous chapter \\n\\n next chapter \\n\\n \\n\\n 3猃I篺lash, crossed Marius\u0027 mind; this was the expedient of which he was in search, the solution of that frightful problem which was torturing him, of sparing the assassin and saving the victim.\\n\\n He knelt down on his commode, stretched out his arm, seized the sheet of paper, softly detached a bit of plaster from the wall, wrapped the paper round it, and tossed the whole through the crevice into the middle of the den.\\n\\n It was high time. Thenardier had conquered his last fears or his last scruples, and was advancing on the prisoner.　\\n\\n \"Something is falling!\" cried the Thenardier woman.\\n\\n \"What is it?\" asked her husband.\\n\\n The woman darted forward and picked up the bit of plaster. She handed it to her husband.\\n\\n \"Where did this come from?\" demanded Thenardier.\\n\\n \"Pardie!\" ejaculated his wife, \"where do you suppose it came from? Through the window, of course.\"　\\n\\n \"I saw it pass,\" said Bigrenaille.\\n\\n Thenardier rapidly unfolded the paper and held it close to the candle.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s in Eponine\u0027s handwriting. The devil!\"\\n\\n He made a sign to his wife, who hastily drew near, and showed her the line written on the sheet of paper, then he added in a subdued voice:--\\n\\n \"Quick! The ladder! Let\u0027s leave the bacon in the mousetrap and decamp!\"\\n\\n \"Without cutting that man\u0027s throat?\" asked, the Thenardier woman.\\n\\n \"We haven\u0027t the time.\"\\n\\n \"Through what?\" resumed Bigrenaille.\\n\\n \"Through the window,\" replied Thenardier. \"Since Ponine has thrown the stone through the window, it indicates that the house is not watched on that side.\"\\n\\n The mask with the ventriloquist\u0027s voice deposited his huge key on the floor, raised both arms in the air, and opened and clenched his fists, three times rapidly without uttering a word.\\n\\n This was the signal like the signal for clearing the decks for action on board ship.\\n\\n The ruffians who were holding the prisoner released him; in the twinkling of an eye the rope ladder was unrolled outside the window, and solidly fastened to the sill by the two iron hooks.\\n\\n The prisoner paid no attention to what was going on around him. He seemed to be dreaming or praying.\\n\\n As soon as the ladder was arranged, Thenardier cried:\\n\\n \"Come! the bourgeoise first!\"\\n\\n And he rushed headlong to the window.\\n\\n But just as he was about to throw his leg over, Bigrenaille seized him roughly by the collar.\\n\\n \"Not much, come now, you old dog, after us!\"\\n\\n \"After us!\" yelled the ruffians.\\n\\n \"You are children,\" said Thenardier, \"we are losing time. \\n\\n The police are on our heels.\"　\\n\\n \"Well, said the ruffians, \"let\u0027s draw lots to see who shall go down first.\"\\n\\n Thenardier exclaimed:--\\n\\n \"Are you mad! Are you crazy! What a pack of boobies! You want to waste time, do you? Draw lots, do you? By a wet finger, by a short straw! With written names! Thrown into a hat!--\"\\n\\n \"Would you like my hat?\" cried a voice on the threshold.\\n\\n All wheeled round. It was Javert.\\n\\n He had his hat in his hand, and was holding it out to them with a smile.\\n\\n 容德雷特等待的大概就是这几个人的到来。他急忙和那拿粗木棒的瘦子问答了几句话。\\n\\n “全准备好了？”容德雷特问。\\n\\n “全准备好了。”那瘦子回答。\\n\\n “巴纳斯山呢？”\\n\\n “小伙子在和你的闺女谈话。”\\n\\n “哪一个？”\\n\\n “老大。”\\n\\n “马车在下面了？”\\n\\n “在下面了。”\\n\\n “那栏杆车也套上了牲口？”\\n\\n “套好了。”\\n\\n “是两匹好马吧？”\\n\\n “最好的两匹。”\\n\\n “在我指定的地方等着吗？”\\n\\n “是的。”\\n\\n “好。”容德雷特说。\\n\\n 白先生脸色苍白。他好象已意识到自己的处境，切实注意着那屋子里在他四周的一切，他的头在颈子上慢慢转动，以谨慎惊讶的神情，注视着那些围绕他的每一个脑袋，但是绝没有一点畏怯的样子。他把那张桌子当作自己的临时防御工事，这人，刚才还只是个平易近人的好老头，却一下子变成了一个赳赳武夫，把两只粗壮的拳头放在他那椅背头上，形态威猛惊人。\\n\\n 这老者，在这样一种危险关头，还那么坚定，那么勇敢，想必是出于那种因心善而胆益壮，临危坦然无所惧的性格。我们绝不会把衷心爱慕的女子的父亲当作路人。马吕斯觉得自己在为这个相见不相识的人感到骄傲。\\n\\n 那三个光着胳膊、被容德雷特称为“通烟囱的”的人，从那废铁堆里，一个拣起了一把剪铁皮用的大剪刀，一个拣了一根平头短撬棍，另一个拣了个铁锤，全一声不响地拦在房门口。老的那个仍旧待在床上，只睁了一下眼睛。容德雷特大娘坐在他旁边。\\n\\n 马吕斯认为只差几秒钟便是应当行动的时候了，他举起右手，朝过道的一面，斜指着天花板，准备随时开枪。\\n\\n 容德雷特和拿粗木棒的人密谈过后，又转向白先生，带着他特有的那种低沉、含蓄、可怕的笑声，再次提出他的问题：\\n\\n “难道你不认得我吗？”\\n\\n 白先生直对着他的脸回答：\\n\\n “不认得。”\\n\\n 于是容德雷特一步跨到桌子边。身躯向前凑到蜡烛的上面，叉着手臂，把他那骨角外凸、凶形恶状的下巴伸向白先生的脸，尽量逼近，正象一头张牙待咬的猛兽，白先生却泰然自若，纹丝不退。他在这种姿势中大声吼道：\\n\\n “我并不叫法邦杜，也不叫容德雷特，我叫德纳第！我就是孟费郿的那个客店老板！你听清楚了吧？德纳第！你现在认得我了吧？”\\n\\n 白先生的额上起了一阵不显著的红潮，他以一贯的镇静态度，声音既不高，也不抖，回答说：\\n\\n “我还是不认得。”\\n\\n 马吕斯没有听到这回答。谁要是在这时在黑影中看见了他，就能见到他是多么惶惑、呆傻、惊慌。当容德雷特说着“我叫德纳第”时，马吕斯的四肢一下全抖了起来，他连忙靠在墙上，仿佛感到有一把利剑冷冰冰地刺穿了他的心。接着，他的右臂，原要开枪告警的，也慢慢垂了下来，当容德雷特重复着说“你听清楚了吧？德纳第！”时，他那五个瘫软了的手指几乎让手枪落了下来。容德雷特在揭露自己时，没有惊扰白先生，却把马吕斯搞得六神无主。德纳第这名字，白先生似乎不知道，马吕斯却知道。让我们回忆一下，这名字对他意味着什么！这名字，是他铭篆在心的，是写了在他父亲的遗嘱上的！这名字，是印在他思想的深处，记忆的深处，载在那神圣的遗训中的：“一个叫德纳第的人救了我的命。我儿遇见他，望尽力报答他。”这名字，我们记得，是他灵魂所倾倒的对象之一，是和他父亲的名字并列在一起来崇拜的。怎么！在眼前的便是德纳第，在眼前的便是他这么多年来寻求不着的那位孟费郿的客店老板！他到底遇见他了，可真是无奇不有！他父亲的救命恩人竟会是一个匪徒！他，马吕斯，一心希望舍命报答的这个人竟会是一个魔怪！搭救彭眉胥上校的那位义士竟在干着犯罪的勾当，马吕斯虽然还闹不清楚他打算干的究竟是什么，但却已具有谋财害命的迹象了！况且是谁的命呵，伟大的上帝！这遭遇太险恶了！命运也未免太作弄人了！他父亲从棺材中命令他尽力报答德纳第，四年来，马吕斯唯一的思想便是要为他父亲了清这笔债，可是，正当他要用法律的力量逮捕一个行凶匪徒的时候，命运却向他吼道：“这是德纳第！”在壮烈的滑铁卢战场上他父亲的生命，被人从弹雨中救出来，他正可以对这人偿愿报恩了，却又报以断头台！他私自许下的心愿是，一旦找到了这位德纳第，他一定要在相见时拜倒在他的膝前，现在他果然找到了，但又把他交给刽子手！他父亲对他说：“救德纳第！”而他以消灭德纳第的行动来回答自己所爱慕的这一神圣的声音！他父亲把冒着生命危险把他从死亡中拯救出来的这个人托付给他马吕斯，现在却要他父亲从坟墓中望着这人在他儿子的告发下被押到圣雅克广场上去受极刑！多少年来，他一直把他父亲亲笔写下的最后愿望牢记在心，却又背弃遗训，反其道而行之，这将是多么荒唐可笑！但是，在另一方面，眼见这场谋害而不加以制止！怎么！坐视受害人受害并听凭杀人犯杀人！对这样一个恶棍，难道能因私恩而缩手？马吕斯四年来所有的种种思想全被这一意外搅乱了。他浑身战栗。一切都取决于他。他一手掌握着这些在他眼下纷纷扰扰的人，虽然他们全不知道。假使他开枪，白先生能得救，德纳第却完了；假使他不开枪，白先生便遭殃，并且，谁知道？德纳第逃了。镇压这一个，或是让那一个去牺牲！他都问心有愧。怎么办？怎么选择？背弃自己素来引以自豪的种种回忆，背弃自己在心灵深处私自许下的种种诺言，背弃最神圣的天职，最庄严的遗言！背弃他父亲的遗嘱，要不就纵容罪行，让它成功！他仿佛一方面听见“他的玉秀儿”在为她的父亲向他央求，一方面又听见那上校在叫他照顾德纳第。他觉得自己疯了。他的两个膝头只往下沉。他甚至没有充分时间来仔细思考，因为他眼前的事态正在疯狂地向前演变。那好象是一阵狂澜，他自以为居于操纵着它的地位，其实已处于被动。他几乎昏了过去。\\n\\n 德纳第棗我们以后不再用旁的名字称呼他了棗这时却在桌子前面踱来踱去，既茫然不知如何是好，又得意到发狂。\\n\\n 他一把抓起烛台，砰的一下把它放在壁炉上，他用力是那么猛，使烛芯几乎熄灭，烛油也飞溅到了墙上。\\n\\n 接着，他转向白先生，龇牙咧嘴地狂叫着：\\n\\n “火烧的！烟熏的！千刀万剐的！抽筋去骨的！”\\n\\n 跟着他又来回走动起来，暴跳如雷地吼道：\\n\\n “啊！我到底找着你了，慈善家先生，穿破烂的百万富翁！送泥娃娃的大好佬！装蒜的傻老头！啊！你不认得我！当然不会认得我！八年前，一八二三年的圣诞前夕来到孟费郿，到我那客店里来的不是你！从我家里把芳汀的孩子百灵鸟拐走的不是你！穿一件黄大氅的不是你！不是！手里还提一大包破衣烂衫，就和今早来到我这里一样！喂，我的妻！这个老施主，他走人家，手里不拿几包毛线袜，好象就不过意似的！百万富翁先生，敢情你是衣帽店老板！你专爱把你店里的底货拿来送给穷人，你这圣人！你的把戏算耍得好！啊！你不认得我？可我，我认得你！你这牛头一钻进这地方，我便立刻把你认出来了。啊！你现在总学到了乖了吧，象那样随随便便跑到别人家里去，借口是住客店，穿上旧衣服，装穷酸相，一个苏也肯要的样子，欺瞒人家，摆阔气，骗取人家的摇钱树，还要在树林里进行威吓，不许人家带回去，等到人家穷下来了，便送上一件大得不成样子的外套和两条医院用的蹩脚毯子，老光棍，拐带孩子的老贼，你现在总学到乖了吧，你的这一套不一定耍得成！”\\n\\n 他停下了。好象是在对自己说着什么。他的那股厉气平息下去了，有如大河的巨浪泻进了落水洞，随后，好象是要大声结束他刚才低声开始的那段对自己说的话，他一拳捶在桌上吼道：\\n\\n “还带着他那种老好人的样子！”\\n\\n 他又指着白先生说：\\n\\n “说正经的！你当初开过我的玩笑。你是我的一切苦难的根子！你花一千五百法郎把我的一个姑娘带走了，这姑娘肯定是什么有钱人家的，她已替我赚过许多钱，我本应好好靠她过一辈子的！在我那倒霉的客马店里，别人吃喝玩乐，可我，象个傻子，把我的一切家当全赔进去了，我原要从那姑娘身上全部捞回来的！呵！我恨不得那些人在我店里喝下去的酒全都是毒药！这些都不用提了！你说说！你把那百灵鸟带走的时候，你一定觉得我是个傻瓜蛋吧！在那树林里，你捏着一根哭丧棍！你比我狠。一报还一报。今日却是我捏着王牌了！你玩完了，我的好老头！啊呀，我要笑个痛快。说真话，我要笑个痛快！这下子他可落在圈套里了！我对他说，我当过戏剧演员，我叫法邦杜，我和马尔斯小姐、缪什小姐演过喜剧，明天，二月四号，我的房东要收房租，可他一点也没看出来，限期是二月八号，并不是二月四号！傻透了的蠢材！他还带来这四个可怜巴巴的菲力浦①！坏种！他连一百法郎也舍不得凑足！再说，我的那些恭维话说得他心里好舒服哟！真有意思。我心里在想：‘冤桶！这下子，我逮住你了！今天早晨我舔了你的爪子，今天晚上，我可要啃你的心了！’” \\n\\n ①菲力浦，就是值二十法郎的路易。\\n\\n 德纳第停了下来。他的气喘不过来了。他那狭窄的胸膛，象个熔炉上的风箱，不断起伏。他的眼睛充满了那种下贱的喜色，也就是一个无能、不义、凶残成性的人在有机会践踏和侮辱他所畏惧过、谄媚过的对象时具有的那种喜色，一个能把脚跟踩在巨人头上的侏儒的欢乐，一只豺狗在开始撕裂一头病到已不能自卫、却还有知觉感受痛苦的雄牛时的欢乐。\\n\\n 白先生不曾打断过他的话，只是在他住嘴时，才向他说：\\n\\n “我不知道您要说的是什么。您弄错了。我是一个很穷的人，远不是个百万富翁。我不认得您。您把我当作另一个人了。”\\n\\n “啊！”德纳\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4344.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
