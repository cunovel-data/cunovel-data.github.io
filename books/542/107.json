{"id":35694,"no":107,"title":"Part 2 Book 5 Chapter 4 The Gropings of Flight","content":"In order to understand what follows, it is requisite to form an exact idea of the Droit-Mur lane, and, in particular, of the angle which one leaves on the left when one emerges from the Rue Polonceau into this lane. Droit-Mur lane was almost entirely bordered on the right, as far as the Rue Petit-Picpus, by houses of mean aspect; on the left by a solitary building of severe outlines, composed of numerous parts which grew gradually higher by a story or two as they approached the Rue Petit-Picpus side; so that this building, which was very lofty on the Rue Petit-Picpus side, was tolerably low on the side adjoining the Rue Polonceau. There, at the angle of which we have spoken, it descended to such a degree that it consisted of merely a wall. This wall did not abut directly on the Street; it formed a deeply retreating niche, concealed by its two corners from two observers who might have been, one in the Rue Polonceau, the other in the Rue Droit-Mur. Beginning with these angles of the niche, the wall extended along the Rue Polonceau as far as a house which bore the number 49, and along the Rue Droit-Mur, where the fragment was much shorter, as far as the gloomy building which we have mentioned and whose gable it intersected, thus forming another retreating angle in the street. This gable was sombre of aspect; only one window was visible, or, to speak more correctly, two shutters covered with a sheet of zinc and kept constantly closed. The state of the places of which we are here giving a description is rigorously exact, and will certainly awaken a very precise memory in the mind of old inhabitants of the quarter. The niche was entirely filled by a thing which resembled a colossal and wretched door; it was a vast, formless assemblage of perpendicular planks, the upper ones being broader than the lower, bound together by long transverse strips of iron. At one side there was a carriage gate of the ordinary dimensions, and which had evidently not been cut more than fifty years previously. A linden-tree showed its crest above the niche, and the wall was covered with ivy on the side of the Rue Polonceau. In the imminent peril in which Jean Valjean found himself, this sombre building had about it a solitary and uninhabited look which tempted him. He ran his eyes rapidly over it; he said to himself, that if he could contrive to get inside it, he might save himself. First he conceived an idea, then a hope. In the central portion of the front of this building, on the Rue Droit-Mur side, there were at all the windows of the different stories ancient cistern pipes of lead. The various branches of the pipes which led from one central pipe to all these little basins sketched out a sort of tree on the front. These ramifications of pipes with their hundred elbows imitated those old leafless vine-stocks which writhe over the fronts of old farm-houses. This odd espalier, with its branches of lead and iron, was the first thing that struck Jean Valjean. He seated Cosette with her back against a stone post, with an injunction to be silent, and ran to the spot where the conduit touched the pavement. Perhaps there was some way of climbing up by it and entering the house. But the pipe was dilapidated and past service, and hardly hung to its fastenings. Moreover, all the windows of this silent dwelling were grated with heavy iron bars, even the attic windows in the roof. And then, the moon fell full upon that facade, and the man who was watching at the corner of the street would have seen Jean Valjean in the act of climbing. And finally, what was to be done with Cosette? How was she to be drawn up to the top of a three-story house? He gave up all idea of climbing by means of the drain-pipe, and crawled along the wall to get back into the Rue Polonceau. When he reached the slant of the wall where he had left Cosette, he noticed that no one could see him there. As we have just explained, he was concealed from all eyes, no matter from which direction they were approaching; besides this, he was in the shadow. Finally, there were two doors; perhaps they might be forced. The wall above which he saw the linden-tree and the ivy evidently abutted on a garden where he could, at least, hide himself, although there were as yet no leaves on the trees, and spend the remainder of the night. Time was passing; he must act quickly. He felt over the carriage door, and immediately recognized the fact that it was impracticable outside and in. He approached the other door with more hope; it was frightfully decrepit; its very immensity rendered it less solid; the planks were rotten; the iron bands--there were only three of them--were rusted. It seemed as though it might be possible to pierce this worm-eaten barrier. On examining it he found that the door was not a door; it had neither hinges, cross-bars, lock, nor fissure in the middle; the iron bands traversed it from side to side without any break. Through the crevices in the planks he caught a view of unhewn slabs and blocks of stone roughly cemented together, which passers-by might still have seen there ten years ago. He was forced to acknowledge with consternation that this apparent door was simply the wooden decoration of a building against which it was placed. It was easy to tear off a plank; but then, one found one\u0027s self face to face with a wall. 和这斜壁两角相连的墙，在波隆梭街方面，一直延伸到第四十九号房屋，而在直壁街一面棗这面短多了棗直抵先头提到过的那所黑暗楼房的山尖，并和山尖构成一个新凹角。那山尖的形状也是阴森森的，墙上只有一道窗子，应当说，只有两块板窗，板上钉了锌皮。并且是永远关着的。 我们在这里所作的关于地形的描写和实际情况完全吻合，一定能在曾经住过这一带的人的心中唤起极精确的回忆。 斜壁的面上完全被一种东西遮满了，看起来仿佛是一道又离又大丑陋不堪的门。其实只是一些胡乱拼揍起来直钉在壁面上的一条条木板，上面的板比较宽，下面的比较窄，又用些长条铁皮横钉在板上，把它们连系起来。旁边有一道大车门，大小和普通的大车门一样，从外形看，那道门的年龄大致不出五十年。 一棵菩提树的枝桠从斜壁的顶上伸出来，靠波隆梭街一面的墙上盖满了常春藤。 冉阿让正在走投无路时看见了那所楼房，冷清清，仿佛里面没有人住似的，便想从那里找出路。他赶忙用眼睛打量了一遍。心里盘算，如果能钻到这里面去，也许有救。他先有了一个主意和一线希望。 楼房的后窗有一部分临直壁街，在这部分中的一段，每层楼上的每个窗口，都装有旧铅皮漏斗。从一根总管分出的各种不同排水管连接在各个漏斗上，好象是画在后墙上面的一棵树。这些分支管，曲曲折折，也好象是一棵盘附在庄屋后墙上的枯葡萄藤。 那种奇形怪状由铅皮管和铁管构成的枝桠最先引起冉阿让的注意。他让珂赛特靠着一块石碑坐下，嘱咐她不要作声，再跑到水管和街道相接的地方。也许有办法从这儿翻到楼房里去。可是水管已经烂了，不中用，和墙上的连系也极不牢固。况且那所冷清清的房屋的每个窗口，连顶楼也计算在内，全都装了粗铁条。月光也正照着这一面，守在街口上的那个人可能会看见冉阿让翻墙。并且，珂赛特又怎么办？怎么把她弄上四层楼？ 他放弃了爬水管的念头，爬在地上，沿着墙根，又回到了波隆梭街。 他回到珂赛特原先所在的斜壁下面后，发现这地方是别人瞧不见的。我们先头说过，他在这地方，可以逃过从任何一面来的视线，并且是藏在黑影里。再说还有两道门。也许撬得开呢。在见到菩提树和常春藤的那道墙里，显然是个园子，尽管树上还没有树叶，他至少可以在园里躲过下半夜。 时间飞快地过去了。他得赶紧行动。 他推推那道大车门，一下便察觉到它内外两面都被钉得严严实实。 他怀着较大的希望去推那道大门。它已经破敝不堪，再加又高又阔，因而更不牢固，木板是腐朽的，长条铁皮只有三条，也全锈了。在这蛀坏了的木壁上穿个洞也许还能办到。 仔细看了以后，他才知道那并不是门。它既没有门斗，也没有铰链，既没有锁，中间也没有缝。一些长条铁皮胡乱横钉在上面，彼此并不连贯。从木板的裂缝里，他隐隐约约看见三合土里的石碴和石块，十年前走过这地方的人也还能看到。他大失所望，不能不承认那外表象门的东西只不过是一所房子背面的护墙板。撬开板子并不难，可是板子后面还有墙。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4244.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
