{"id":35637,"no":50,"title":"Part 1 Book 5 Chapter 13 The Solution of Some Questions connected with the Municipal Police","content":"Javert thrust aside the spectators, broke the circle, and set out with long strides towards the police station, which is situated at the extremity of the square, dragging the wretched woman after him. She yielded mechanically. Neither he nor she uttered a word. The cloud of spectators followed, jesting, in a paroxysm of delight. Supreme misery an occasion for obscenity.\n On arriving at the police station, which was a low room, warmed by a stove, with a glazed and grated door opening on the street, and guarded by a detachment, Javert opened the door, entered with Fantine, and shut the door behind him, to the great disappointment of the curious, who raised themselves on tiptoe, and craned their necks in front of the thick glass of the station-house, in their effort to see. Curiosity is a sort of gluttony. To see is to devour.\n On entering, Fantine fell down in a corner, motionless and mute, crouching down like a terrified dog.\n The sergeant of the guard brought a lighted candle to the table. Javert seated himself, drew a sheet of stamped paper from his pocket, and began to write.\n This class of women is consigned by our laws entirely to the discretion of the police. The latter do what they please, punish them, as seems good to them, and confiscate at their will those two sorry things which they entitle their industry and their liberty. Javert was impassive; his grave face betrayed no emotion whatever. Nevertheless, he was seriously and deeply preoccupied. It was one of those moments when he was exercising without control, but subject to all the scruples of a severe conscience, his redoubtable discretionary power. At that moment he was conscious that his police agent\u0027s stool was a tribunal. He was entering judgment. He judged and condemned. He summoned all the ideas which could possibly exist in his mind, around the great thing which he was doing. The more he examined the deed of this woman, the more shocked he felt. It was evident that he had just witnessed the commission of a crime. He had just beheld, yonder, in the street, society, in the person of a freeholder and an elector, insulted and attacked by a creature who was outside all pales. A prostitute had made an attempt on the life of a citizen. He had seen that, he, Javert. He wrote in silence.\n When he had finished he signed the paper, folded it, and said to the sergeant of the guard, as he handed it to him, \"Take three men and conduct this creature to jail.\"\n Then, turning to Fantine, \"You are to have six months of it.\" The unhappy woman shuddered.\n \"Six months! six months of prison!\" she exclaimed. \"Six months in which to earn seven sous a day! But what will become of Cosette? My daughter! my daughter! But I still owe the Thenardiers over a hundred francs; do you know that, Monsieur Inspector?\"\n She dragged herself across the damp floor, among the muddy boots of all those men, without rising, with clasped hands, and taking great strides on her knees.\n \"Monsieur Javert,\" said she, \"I beseech your mercy. I assure you that I was not in the wrong. If you had seen the beginning, you would have seen. I swear to you by the good God that I was not to blame! That gentleman, the bourgeois, whom I do not know, put snow in my back. Has any one the right to put snow down our backs when we are walking along peaceably, and doing no harm to any one? I am rather ill, as you see. And then, he had been saying impertinent things to me for a long time: `You are ugly! you have no teeth!\u0027 I know well that I have no longer those teeth. I did nothing; I said to myself, `The gentleman is amusing himself.\u0027 I was honest with him; I did not speak to him. It was at that moment that he put the snow down my back. Monsieur Javert, good Monsieur Inspector! is there not some person here who saw it and can tell you that this is quite true? Perhaps I did wrong to get angry. You know that one is not master of one\u0027s self at the first moment. One gives way to vivacity; and then, when some one puts something cold down your back just when you are not expecting it! I did wrong to spoil that gentleman\u0027s hat. Why did he go away? I would ask his pardon. Oh, my God! It makes no difference to me whether I ask his pardon. Do me the favor to-day, for this once, Monsieur Javert. Hold! you do not know that in prison one can earn only seven sous a day; it is not the government\u0027s fault, but seven sous is one\u0027s earnings; and just fancy, I must pay one hundred francs, or my little girl will be sent to me. Oh, my God! I cannot have her with me. What I do is so vile! Oh, my Cosette! Oh, my little angel of the Holy Virgin! what will become of her, poor creature? I will tell you: it is the Thenardiers, inn-keepers, peasants; and such people are unreasonable. They want money. Don\u0027t put me in prison! You see, there is a little girl who will be turned out into the street to get along as best she may, in the very heart of the winter; and you must have pity on such a being, my good Monsieur Javert. If she were older, she might earn her living; but it cannot be done at that age. I am not a bad woman at bottom. It is not cowardliness and gluttony that have made me what I am. If I have drunk brandy, it was out of misery. I do not love it; but it benumbs the senses. When I was happy, it was only necessary to glance into my closets, and it would have been evident that I was not a coquettish and untidy woman. I had linen, a great deal of linen. Have pity on me, Monsieur Javert!\"\n She spoke thus, rent in twain, shaken with sobs, blinded with tears, her neck bare, wringing her hands, and coughing with a dry, short cough, stammering softly with a voice of agony. Great sorrow is a divine and terrible ray, which transfigures the unhappy. At that moment Fantine had become beautiful once more. From time to time she paused, and tenderly kissed the police agent\u0027s coat. She would have softened a heart of granite; but a heart of wood cannot be softened.\n \"Come!\" said Javert, \"I have heard you out. Have you entirely finished? You will get six months. Now march! The Eternal Father in person could do nothing more.\"\n At these solemn words, \"the Eternal Father in person could do nothing more,\" she understood that her fate was sealed. She sank down, murmuring, \"Mercy!\"\n Javert turned his back.\n The soldiers seized her by the arms.\n A few moments earlier a man had entered, but no one had paid any heed to him. He shut the door, leaned his back against it, and listened to Fantine\u0027s despairing supplications.\n At the instant when the soldiers laid their hands upon the unfortunate woman, who would not rise, he emerged from the shadow, and said:--\n \"One moment, if you please.\"\n Javert raised his eyes and recognized M. Madeleine. He removed his hat, and, saluting him with a sort of aggrieved awkwardness:--\n \"Excuse me, Mr. Mayor--\"\n The words \"Mr. Mayor\" produced a curious effect upon Fantine. She rose to her feet with one bound, like a spectre springing from the earth, thrust aside the soldiers with both arms, walked straight up to M. Madeleine before any one could prevent her, and gazing intently at him, with a bewildered air, she cried:--\n \"Ah! so it is you who are M. le Maire!\"\n Then she burst into a laugh, and spit in his face.\n M. Madeleine wiped his face, and said:--\n \"Inspector Javert, set this woman at liberty.\"\n Javert felt that he was on the verge of going mad. He experienced at that moment, blow upon blow and almost simultaneously, the most violent emotions which he had ever undergone in all his life. To see a woman of the town spit in the mayor\u0027s face was a thing so monstrous that, in his most daring flights of fancy, he would have regarded it as a sacrilege to believe it possible. On the other hand, at the very bottom of his thought, he made a hideous comparison as to what this woman was, and as to what this mayor might be; and then he, with horror, caught a glimpse of I know not what simple explanation of this prodigious attack. But when he beheld that mayor, that magistrate, calmly wipe his face and say, \"Set this woman at liberty,\" he underwent a sort of intoxication of amazement; thought and word failed him equally; the sum total of possible astonishment had been exceeded in his case. He remained mute.\n The words had produced no less strange an effect on Fantine. She raised her bare arm, and clung to the damper of the stove, like a person who is reeling. Nevertheless, she glanced about her, and began to speak in a low voice, as though talking to herself:--\n \"At liberty! I am to be allowed to go! I am not to go to prison for six months! Who said that? It is not possible that any one could have said that. I did not hear aright. It cannot have been that monster of a mayor! Was it you, my good Monsieur Javert, who said that I was to be set free? Oh, see here! I will tell you about it, and you will let me go. That monster of a mayor, that old blackguard of a mayor, is the cause of all. Just imagine, Monsieur Javert, he turned me out! all because of a pack of rascally women, who gossip in the workroom. If that is not a horror, what is? To dismiss a poor girl who is doing her work honestly! Then I could no longer earn enough, and all this misery followed. In the first place, there is one improvement which these gentlemen of the police ought to make, and that is, to prevent prison contractors from wronging poor people. I will explain it to you, you see: you are earning twelve sous at shirt-making, the price falls to nine sous; and it is not enough to live on. Then one has to become whatever one can. As for me, I had my little Cosette, and I was actually forced to become a bad woman. Now you understand how it is that that blackguard of a mayor caused all the mischief. After that I stamped on that gentleman\u0027s hat in front of the officers\u0027 cafe; but he had spoiled my whole dress with snow. We women have but one silk dress for evening wear. You see that I did not do wrong deliberately--truly, Monsieur Javert; and everywhere I behold women who are far more wicked than I, and who are much happier. O Monsieur Javert! it was you who gave orders that I am to be set free, was it not? Make inquiries, speak to my landlord; I am paying my rent now; they will tell you that I am perfectly honest. Ah! my God! I beg your pardon; I have unintentionally touched the damper of the stove, and it has made it smoke.\"\n M. Madeleine listened to her with profound attention. While she was speaking, he fumbled in his waistcoat, drew out his purse and opened it. It was empty. He put it back in his pocket. He said to Fantine, \"How much did you say that you owed?\"\n Fantine, who was looking at Javert only, turned towards him:--\n \"Was I speaking to you?\"\n Then, addressing the soldiers:--\n \"Say, you fellows, did you see how I spit in his face? Ah! you old wretch of a mayor, you came here to frighten me, but I\u0027m not afraid of you. I am afraid of Monsieur Javert. I am afraid of my good Monsieur Javert!\"\n So saying, she turned to the inspector again:--\n \"And yet, you see, Mr. Inspector, it is necessary to be just. I understand that you are just, Mr. Inspector; in fact, it is perfectly simple: a man amuses himself by putting snow down a woman\u0027s back, and that makes the officers laugh; one must divert themselves in some way; and we--well, we are here for them to amuse themselves with, of course! And then, you, you come; you are certainly obliged to preserve order, you lead off the woman who is in the wrong; but on reflection, since you are a good man, you say that I am to be set at liberty; it is for the sake of the little one, for six months in prison would prevent my supporting my child. `Only, don\u0027t do it again, you hussy!\u0027 Oh! I won\u0027t do it again, Monsieur Javert! They may do whatever they please to me now; I will not stir. But to-day, you see, I cried because it hurt me. I was not expecting that snow from the gentleman at all; and then as I told you, I am not well; I have a cough; I seem to have a burning ball in my stomach, and the doctor tells me, `Take care of yourself.\u0027 Here, feel, give me your hand; don\u0027t be afraid-- it is here.\"\n She no longer wept, her voice was caressing; she placed Javert\u0027s coarse hand on her delicate, white throat and looked smilingly at him.\n All at once she rapidly adjusted her disordered garments, dropped the folds of her skirt, which had been pushed up as she dragged herself along, almost to the height of her knee, and stepped towards the door, saying to the soldiers in a low voice, and with a friendly nod:--\n \"Children, Monsieur l\u0027Inspecteur has said that I am to be released, and I am going.\"\n She laid her hand on the latch of the door. One step more and she would be in the street.\n Javert up to that moment had remained erect, motionless, with his eyes fixed on the ground, cast athwart this scene like some displaced statue, which is waiting to be put away somewhere.\n The sound of the latch roused him. He raised his head with an expression of sovereign authority, an expression all the more alarming in proportion as the authority rests on a low level, ferocious in the wild beast, atrocious in the man of no estate.\n \"Sergeant!\" he cried, \"don\u0027t you see that that jade is walking off! Who bade you let her go?\"\n \"I,\" said Madeleine.\n Fantine trembled at the sound of Javert\u0027s voice, and let go of the latch as a thief relinquishes the article which he has stolen. At the sound of Madeleine\u0027s voice she turned around, and from that moment forth she uttered no word, nor dared so much as to breathe freely, but her glance strayed from Madeleine to Javert, and from Javert to Madeleine in turn, according to which was speaking.\n It was evident that Javert must have been exasperated beyond measure before he would permit himself to apostrophize the sergeant as he had done, after the mayor\u0027s suggestion that Fantine should be set at liberty. Had he reached the point of forgetting the mayor\u0027s presence? Had he finally declared to himself that it was impossible that any \"authority\" should have given such an order, and that the mayor must certainly have said one thing by mistake for another, without intending it? Or, in view of the enormities of which he had been a witness for the past two hours, did he say to himself, that it was necessary to recur to supreme resolutions, that it was indispensable that the small should be made great, that the police spy should transform himself into a magistrate, that the policeman should become a dispenser of justice, and that, in this prodigious extremity, order, law, morality, government, society in its entirety, was personified in him, Javert?\n However that may be, when M. Madeleine uttered that word, _I_, as we have just heard, Police Inspector Javert was seen to turn toward the mayor, pale, cold, with blue lips, and a look of despair, his whole body agitated by an imperceptible quiver and an unprecedented occurrence, and say to him, with downcast eyes but a firm voice:--\n \"Mr. Mayor, that cannot be.\"\n \"Why not?\" said M. Madeleine.\n \"This miserable woman has insulted a citizen.\"\n \"Inspector Javert,\" replied the mayor, in a calm and conciliating tone, \"listen. You are an honest man, and I feel no hesitation in explaining matters to you. Here is the true state of the case: I was passing through the square just as you were leading this woman away; there were still groups of people standing about, and I made inquiries and learned everything; it was the townsman who was in the wrong and who should have been arrested by properly conducted police.\"\n Javert retorted:--\n \"This wretch has just insulted Monsieur le Maire.\"\n \"That concerns me,\" said M. Madeleine. \"My own insult belongs to me, I think. I can do what I please about it.\"\n \"I beg Monsieur le Maire\u0027s pardon. The insult is not to him but to the law.\"\n \"Inspector Javert,\" replied M. Madeleine, \"the highest law is conscience. I have heard this woman; I know what I am doing.\"\n \"And I, Mr. Mayor, do not know what I see.\"\n \"Then content yourself with obeying.\"\n \"I am obeying my duty. My duty demands that this woman shall serve six months in prison.\"\n M. Madeleine replied gently:--\n \"Heed this well; she will not serve a single day.\"\n At this decisive word, Javert ventured to fix a searching look on the mayor and to say, but in a tone of voice that was still profoundly respectful:--\n \"I am sorry to oppose Monsieur le Maire; it is for the first time in my life, but he will permit me to remark that I am within the bounds of my authority. I confine myself, since Monsieur le Maire desires it, to the question of the gentleman. I was present. This woman flung herself on Monsieur Bamatabnois, who is an elector and the proprietor of that handsome house with a balcony, which forms the corner of the esplanade, three stories high and entirely of cut stone. Such things as there are in the world! In any case, Monsieur le Maire, this is a question of police regulations in the streets, and concerns me, and I shall detain this woman Fantine.\"\n Then M. Madeleine folded his arms, and said in a severe voice which no one in the town had heard hitherto:--\n \"The matter to which you refer is one connected with the municipal police. According to the terms of articles nine, eleven, fifteen, and sixty-six of the code of criminal examination, I am the judge. I order that this woman shall be set at liberty.\"\n Javert ventured to make a final effort.\n \"But, Mr. Mayor--\"\n \"I refer you to article eighty-one of the law of the 13th of December, 1799, in regard to arbitrary detention.\"\n \"Monsieur le Maire, permit me--\"\n \"Not another word.\"\n \"But--\"\n \"Leave the room,\" said M. Madeleine.\n Javert received the blow erect, full in the face, in his breast, like a Russian soldier. He bowed to the very earth before the mayor and left the room.\n Fantine stood aside from the door and stared at him in amazement as he passed.\n Nevertheless, she also was the prey to a strange confusion. She had just seen herself a subject of dispute between two opposing powers. She had seen two men who held in their hands her liberty, her life, her soul, her child, in combat before her very eyes; one of these men was drawing her towards darkness, the other was leading her back towards the light. In this conflict, viewed through the exaggerations of terror, these two men had appeared to her like two giants; the one spoke like her demon, the other like her good angel. The angel had conquered the demon, and, strange to say, that which made her shudder from head to foot was the fact that this angel, this liberator, was the very man whom she abhorred, that mayor whom she had so long regarded as the author of all her woes, that Madeleine! And at the very moment when she had insulted him in so hideous a fashion, he had saved her! Had she, then, been mistaken? Must she change her whole soul? She did not know; she trembled. She listened in bewilderment, she looked on in affright, and at every word uttered by M. Madeleine she felt the frightful shades of hatred crumble and melt within her, and something warm and ineffable, indescribable, which was both joy, confidence and love, dawn in her heart.\n When Javert had taken his departure, M. Madeleine turned to her and said to her in a deliberate voice, like a serious man who does not wish to weep and who finds some difficulty in speaking:--\n \"I have heard you. I knew nothing about what you have mentioned. I believe that it is true, and I feel that it is true. I was even ignorant of the fact that you had left my shop. Why did you not apply to me? But here; I will pay your debts, I will send for your child, or you shall go to her. You shall live here, in Paris, or where you please. I undertake the care of your child and yourself. You shall not work any longer if you do not like. I will give all the money you require. You shall be honest and happy once more. And listen! I declare to you that if all is as you say,--and I do not doubt it,-- you have never ceased to be virtuous and holy in the sight of God. Oh! poor woman.\"\n This was more than Fantine could bear. To have Cosette! To leave this life of infamy. To live free, rich, happy, respectable with Cosette; to see all these realities of paradise blossom of a sudden in the midst of her misery. She stared stupidly at this man who was talking to her, and could only give vent to two or three sobs, \"Oh! Oh! Oh!\"\n Her limbs gave way beneath her, she knelt in front of M. Madeleine, and before he could prevent her he felt her grasp his hand and press her lips to it.\n Then she fainted.\n 最大的不幸，是她听到了一大堆肮脏的话。\n 警署的办公室是一间矮厅，里面有一炉火，有个岗警在看守，还有一扇临街的铁栏玻璃门，沙威走到那里，开了门，和芳汀一道走进去，随后把门关上，使那些好奇的人们大失所望，他们仍旧拥在警署门口那块因保安警察挡着而看不清的玻璃前面，翘足引颈，想看个究竟。好奇是一种食欲。看，便是吞吃。\n 芳汀进门以后，走去坐在墙角里，不动也不说话，缩成一团，好象一条害怕的母狗。\n 那警署里的中士拿来一支燃着的烛放在桌上。沙威坐下，从衣袋里抽出一张公文纸，开始写起来。\n 这样的妇女已由我们的法律交给警察全权处理了。警察对于这类妇女可以任意处罚，为所欲为，并且可以随意褫夺她们所谓的职业和自由那两件不幸的东西。沙威是铁面无情的，他严厉的面容，绝不露一点慌张的颜色。他只是在深沉地运用心思。这正是他独当一面、执行他那种骇人的专断大权的时候，他总是用那种硬心肠的苛刻态度来处理一切。这时他觉得，他的那张警察专用的小凳就是公堂，他斟酌又斟酌，然后下判语。他尽其所能，围绕着他所办的那件大事，搜索他脑子里所有的全部思想。他越考虑那个妓女所作的事就越觉得自己怒不可遏。他刚才看见的明明是桩大罪。他刚才看见，那儿，在街上，一个有财产和选举权的公民所代表的社会，被一个什么也不容的畜生所侮辱、所冲犯了。一个娼妓竟敢冒犯一个绅士。他，沙威，他目击了那样一件事，他一声不响，只管写。\n 他写完时签上了名，把那张纸折起来，交给那中士，向他说：“带三个人，把这婊子押到牢里去。”随又转向芳汀说：“判你六个月的监禁。”\n 那苦恼的妇人大吃一惊。\n “六个月！六个月的监牢！”她号着说。“六个月，每天赚七个苏！那，珂赛特将怎么办？我的娃娃！我的娃娃！并且我还欠德纳第家一百多法郎，侦察员先生，您知道这个吗？”\n 她跪在石板上，在众人的靴子所留下的泥浆中，合拢双手，用膝头大步往前拖。\n “沙威先生！”她说，“我求您开恩。我担保，我确实没有错处。假使您一开头就看见这件事，您就明白了。我在慈悲的上帝面前发誓，我没有犯错误。是那位老板先生，我又不认识他，他把雪塞在我的背上。难道我们那样好好地走着，一点也没有惹人家，人家倒有把雪塞在我们背上的道理吗？我吓了一跳。我原有一点病，您知道吗？并且他向我罗嗦了好些时候。‘你丑！’‘你没有牙齿！’我早知道我没有牙齿。我并没有做什么。我心里想：‘这位先生寻开心。’我对他规规矩矩，我没有和他说话。他在那样一刹那间把雪塞在我的背上。沙威先生，我的好侦察员先生！难道这儿就没有一个人看见过当时的经过来向您说这是真话吗？我生了气，那也许不应当。您知道在开始做这种生意时是不容易控制自己的。我太冒失了。并且，一把那样冷的东西，乘你不备，塞在你的背上！我不应当弄坏那位先生的帽子。他为什么走了呢？他如果在这里，我会求他饶恕的。唉！我的上帝，求他饶恕，我毫不在乎。今天这一次请您开了恩吧，沙威先生。呵，您不知道这个，在监牢里，每天只能赚七个苏，那不是政府的错处，但是每天只有七个苏，并且请您想想，我有一百法郎要付，不付的话，人家就会把我的小女儿送回来。唉！我的上帝，我不能带她在身边，我做的事多么可耻呵！我的珂赛特，呵，我的慈悲圣母的小天使，她怎么办呢？可怜的小宝贝！我要和您说，德纳第那种开客店的，那种乡下人，是没有道理可讲的。他们非要钱不行。请不要把我关在牢里！请您想想，那是一个小娃娃，他们会在这种最冷的冬天把她丢在大路上，让她去；我的好沙威先生，您对这种事应当可怜可怜呀。假使她大一点，她也可以谋生，可是在她那种年纪，她做不到。老实说，我并不是个坏女人，并不是好吃懒做使我到了这种地步。我喝了酒，那是因为我心里难受。我并不贪喝，但是酒会把人弄糊涂的。从前当我比较快乐时，别人只消看看我的衣柜，一眼就会明白我并不是个污七八糟爱俏的女人。我从前有过换洗衣裳，许多换洗衣裳。可怜可怜我吧，沙威先生！”\n 她那样弯着身子述说苦情，泪眼昏花，敞着胸，绞着手，干促地咳嗽，低声下气，形同垂死的人。深沉的痛苦是转变穷苦人容貌的一种威猛的神光。当时芳汀忽然变美了。有那么一会儿，她停下来，轻轻地吻着那探子礼服的下摆。一颗石心也会被她说软的，但一颗木头的心是软化不了的。\n “好！”沙威说，“你说的我已经听见了。你说完了没有？走吧，现在。你有你的六个月，永生的天父亲自到来也没有办法。”\n 听见了那种威严的句子“永生的天父亲自到来也没有办法”时，她知道这次的判决是无可挽回的了。她垂头丧气、声嘶喉哽地说：\n “开恩呀！”\n 沙威把背对着她。\n 兵士们捉住了她的胳膊。\n 几分钟以前，已有一个人在众人不知不觉之间进来了，他关好门，靠在门上，听到了芳汀的哀求。\n 正当兵士们把手放在那不肯起立的倒霉妇人身上，他上前一步，从黑影里钻出来说：“请你们等一会！”\n 沙威抬起眼睛，看见了马德兰先生。他脱下帽子，带着一种不自在的怒容向他致敬：\n “失礼了，市长先生……”\n 市长先生这几个字给了芳汀一种奇特的感觉。她好象从地里跳起的僵尸一样，猛地一下直立起来，张开两臂，把那些士兵推向两旁，他们还没来得及阻挡她，她已直向马德兰先生走去，疯人似的，盯住他喊道：\n “哈！市长先生，原来就是你这小子！”\n 随着，她放声大笑，一口唾沫吐在他脸上。\n 马德兰先生揩揩脸，说道：\n “侦察员沙威，释放这个妇人。”\n 沙威这时觉得自己要疯了。他在这一刹那间，接二连三，并且几乎是连成一气地感受到他生平从未有过的强烈冲动。看见一个公娼唾市长的面，这种事在他的想象中确是已经荒谬到了无法想象的地步，即使只偶起一念，认为那是可能发生的事，那已可算是犯了大不敬的罪。另一方面，在他思想深处，他已把那妇人的身份和那市长的人格连系起来，起了一种可怕的胡思乱想，因而那种怪诞的罪行的根源，在他看来，又是十分简单的，他想到此地，无比憎恨。同时他看见那位市长，那位长官，平心静气地揩着脸，还说“释放这个妇人”，他简直吓得有点头昏眼花；他脑子不能再想，嘴也不能再动了，那种惊骇已超出他可能接受的限度，他一言不发地立着。\n 芳汀听了那句话也同样惊骇。她举起她赤裸的胳膊，握紧了那火炉的钮门，好象一个要昏倒的人。同时，她四面望望，又低声地好象自言自语地说起话来。\n “释放！让我走！我不去坐六个月的牢！这是谁说出来的？说出这样的话是不可能的。我听错了。一定不会是那鬼市长说的！是您吧，我的好沙威先生，是您要把我放走吧？呵！您瞧！让我告诉您，您就会让我走的。这个鬼市长，这个老流氓市长是一切的祸根。您想想吧，沙威先生，他听了那厂里一些胡说八道的娼妇的话，把我撵了出来。那还不算混蛋！把一个做工做得好好的穷女人撵出去！从那以后，我赚的钱就不够了，一切苦恼也都来了。警署里的先生们本有一件理应改良的事，就是应当禁止监牢里的那些包工来害穷人吃苦。我来向您把这件事说清楚，您听吧。您本来做衬衫，每天赚十二个苏，忽然减到了九个，再也没有办法活下去了。我们总得找出路，我，我有我的小珂赛特，我是被逼得太厉害了才当娼妓的。您现在懂得害人的就是那个害人的忘八市长。我还要说，我在军官咖啡馆的前面踏坏了那位先生的帽子。不过他呢，他拿着雪把我一身衣服全弄坏了。我们这种人，只有一件绸子衣服，特为晚上穿的。您瞧，我从没有故意害过人，确是这样，沙威先生，并且我处处都看见许多女人，她们都比我坏，又都比我快乐。呵，沙威先生，是您说了把我放出去，不是吗？您去查吧，您去问我的房东吧，现在我已按期付房租了，他们自然会告诉您我是老实人。呀！我的上帝。请您原谅，我不留心碰了火炉的钮门，弄到冒烟了。”\n 马德兰先生全神贯注地听着她的话，正当她说时，他搜了一回背心，掏出他的钱袋，打开来看。它是空的，他又把它插进衣袋，向芳汀说：\n “您说您欠人多少钱呀？”\n 芳汀原只望着沙威，她回转头向着他：\n “我是在和你说话吗？”\n 随后，她又向那些警察说：\n “喂，你们这些人看见我怎样把口水吐在他脸上吗？嘿！老奸贼市长，你到此地来吓我，但是我不怕你。我只怕沙威先生。\n 我只怕我的好沙威先生！”\n 这样说着，她又转过去朝着那位侦察员。\n “既是这样，您瞧，侦察员先生，就应当公平，我知道您是公平的，侦察员先生。老实说，事情是极简单的，一个人闹着玩儿，把一点点雪放到一个女人的背上，这样可以逗那些军官们笑笑，人总应当寻点东西开开心，我们这些东西本来就是给人开心的，有什么稀奇！随后，您，您来了，您自然应当维持秩序，您把那个犯错误的妇人带走，但是，仔细想来，您多么好，您说释放我，那一定是为了那小女孩，因为六个月的监牢，我就不能养活我的孩子了。不过，不好再闹事了呀，贱婆！呵！我不会再闹事了，沙威先生！从今以后，人家可以随便作弄我，我总不会乱动了。只是今天，您知道，我叫了一声，因为那东西使我太受不了，我一点没有防备那位先生的雪，并且，我已向您说过，我的身体不大好，我咳嗽，我的胃里好象有块滚烫的东西，医生吩咐过‘好好保养。’瞧，您摸摸，把您的手伸出来，不用害怕，就是这儿。”\n 她已不哭了，她的声音是娓娓动听的，她把沙威那只大而粗的手压在她那白嫩的胸脯上，笑眯眯地望着他。\n 忽然，她急忙整理她身上零乱的衣服，把弄皱了的地方扯平，因为那衣服，当她在地上跪着走时，几乎被拉到膝头上来了。她朝着大门走去，向那些士兵和颜悦色地点着头，柔声说道：\n “孩子们，侦察员说过了，放我走，我走了。”\n 她把手放在门闩上。再走一步，她便到了街上。\n 沙威一直立着没有动，眼睛望着地，他在这一场合处于一种极不适合的地位，好象一座曾被人移动、正待安置的塑像。\n 门闩的声音惊醒了他。他抬起头，露出一副俨然不可侵犯的表情，那种表情越是出自职位卑下的人就越加显得可怕，在猛兽的脸上显得凶恶，在下流人的脸上就显得残暴。“中士，”他吼道，“你没看见那骚货要走！谁吩咐了你让她走？”\n “我。”马德兰说。\n 芳汀听了沙威的声音，抖起来了，连忙丢了门闩，好象一个被擒的小偷丢下赃物似的。听了马德兰的声音，她转过来，从这时起，她一字不吐，连呼吸也不敢放肆，目光轮流地从马德兰望到沙威，又从沙威望到马德兰，谁说话，她便望着谁。当然，沙威必须是象我们常说的那样，到了“怒气冲天”才敢在市长有了释放芳汀的指示后还象刚才那样冲撞那中士。难道他竟忘了市长在场吗？难道他在思考之后认为一个“领导”不可能作出那样一种指示吗？难道他认为市长先生之所以支持那个女人，是一种言不由衷的表现吗？或者在这两个钟头里他亲自见到的这桩大事面前，他认为必须抱定最后决心，使小人物变成大人物，使士兵变成官长，使警察变成法官，并在这种非常急迫的场合里，所有秩序、法律、道德、政权、整个社会，都必须由他沙威一个人来体现吗？\n 总而言之，当马德兰先生说了刚才大家听到的那个“我”字以后，侦察员沙威便转身向着市长先生，面色发青，嘴唇发紫，形容冷峻，目光凶顽，浑身有着一种不可察觉的战栗，并且说也奇怪，他眼睛朝下，但是语气坚决：\n “市长先生，那不行。”\n “怎样？”马德兰先生说。\n “这背时女人侮辱了一位绅士。”\n “侦察员沙威，”马德兰先生用一种委婉平和的口音回答说，“听我说。您是个诚实人，不难向您解释清楚。实际情形是这样的。刚才您把这妇人带走时，我正走过那广场，当时也还有成群的人在场，我进行了调查，我全知道了，错的是那位绅士，应当拿他，才合警察公正的精神。”\n 沙威回答说：\n “这贱人刚才侮辱了市长先生。”\n “那是我的事，”马德兰先生说，“我想我受的侮辱应当是属于我的，我可以照自己的意见处理。”\n “我请市长先生原谅。他受的侮辱并不是属于他的，而是属于法律的。”\n “侦察员沙威，”马德兰先生回答说，“最高的法律是良心。\n 我听了这妇人的谈话。我明白我做的事。”\n “但是我，市长先生，我不明白我见到的事。”\n “那么，您服从就是。”\n “我服从我的职责。我的职责要求这个妇人坐六个月的监。”\n 马德兰先生和颜悦色地回答说：\n “请听清楚这一点。她一天也不会坐。”\n 沙威听了那句坚决的话，竟敢定睛注视市长，并且和他辩，但是他说话的声音始终是极其恭敬的：\n “我和市长先生拌嘴，衷心感到痛苦，这是我生平第一次，但是我请求他准许我提出这一点意见：我是在我的职守范围以内。市长先生既是愿意，我再来谈那位绅士的事。当时我在场，是这个婊子先跳上去打巴马达波先生的，巴马达波先生是选民，并且是公园角上那座石条砌的有阳台的三层漂亮公馆的主人。在这世界上，有些事终究是该注意的！总而言之，市长先生，这件事和我有关，牵涉到一个街道警察的职务问题，我决定要收押芳汀这个妇人。”\n 马德兰先生叉起两条胳膊，用一种严厉的、在这城里还没有人听见过的声音说道：\n “您提的这个问题是个市政警察问题。根据刑法第九、第十一、第十五和第六十六条，我是这个问题的审判人。我命令释放这个妇人。”\n 沙威还要作最后的努力：\n “但是，市长先生……”\n “我请您注意一七九九年十二月十三日的法律，关于擅行拘捕问题的第八十一条。”\n “市长先生，请允许我……”\n “一个字也不必再说。”\n “可是……”\n “出去！”马德兰先生说。\n 沙威正面直立，好象一个俄罗斯士兵，接受了这个硬钉子。他向市长先生深深鞠躬，一直弯到地面，出去了。\n 芳汀赶忙让路，望着他从她面前走过，吓得魂不附体。\n 同时她也被一种奇怪的撩乱了的心情控制住了。她刚才见到她自己成了两种对立力量的争夺对象。她见到两个掌握她的自由、生命、灵魂、孩子的人在她眼前斗争，那两个人中的一个把她拖向黑暗，一个把她拖向光明，在这场斗争里，她从扩大了的恐怖中看去，仿佛觉得他们是两个巨人，一个说话，好象是她的恶魔，一个说话，好象是她的吉祥天使。天使战胜了恶魔。不过使她从头到脚战栗的也就是那个天使，那个救星，却又恰巧是她所深恶痛绝、素来认为是她一切痛苦的罪魁的那个市长，那个马德兰！正当她狠狠侮辱了他一番之后，他却援救了她！难道她弄错了？难道她该完全改变她的想法？……她莫名其妙，她发抖，她望着，听着，头昏目眩，马德兰先生每说一句话，她都觉得当初的那种仇恨的幢幢黑影在她心里融化，坍塌，代之以融融的不可言喻的欢乐、信心和爱。\n 沙威出去以后，马德兰先生转身朝着她，好象一个吞声忍泪的长者，向她慢慢说：\n “我听到了您的话，您所说的我以前完全不知道。我相信那是真的，我也觉得那是真的。连您离开我车间的事我也不知道。您当初为什么不来找我呢？现在这样吧：我代您还债，我把您的孩子接来，或者您去找她。您以后住在此地，或是巴黎，都听您的便。您的孩子和您都归我负责。您可以不必再工作，假使您愿意。您需要多少钱，我都照给。将来您生活愉快，同时也做个诚实的人。并且，听清楚，我现在就向您说，假使您刚才说的话全是真的（我也并不怀疑），您的一生，在上帝面前，也始终是善良贞洁的。呵！可怜的妇人！”\n 这已不是那可怜的芳汀能消受得了的。得到珂赛特！脱离这种下贱的生活！自由自在地、富裕快乐诚实地和珂赛特一道过活！她在颠连困苦中忽然看到这种现实的天堂生活显现在她眼前，她将信将疑地望着那个和她谈话的人，她只能在痛哭中发出了两三次“呵！呵！呵！”的声音，她的膝头往下沉，跪在马德兰先生跟前，他还没有来得及提防，已经觉得她拿住了他的手，并且把嘴唇压上去了。\n 她随即晕过去了。\n \n
