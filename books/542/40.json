{"id":35627,"no":40,"title":"Part 1 Book 5 Chapter 1 The History of a Progress in Black Glass Trinkets","content":"And in the meantime, what had become of that mother who according to the people at Montfermeil, seemed to have abandoned her child? Where was she? What was she doing?\\n\\n After leaving her little Cosette with the Thenardiers, she had continued her journey, and had reached M. sur M.\\n\\n This, it will be remembered, was in 1818.\\n\\n Fantine had quitted her province ten years before. M. sur M. Had changed its aspect. While Fantine had been slowly descending from wretchedness to wretchedness, her native town had prospered.\\n\\n About two years previously one of those industrial facts which are the grand events of small districts had taken place.\\n\\n This detail is important, and we regard it as useful to develop it at length; we should almost say, to underline it.\\n\\n From time immemorial, M. sur M. had had for its special industry the imitation of English jet and the black glass trinkets of Germany. This industry had always vegetated, on account of the high price of the raw material, which reacted on the manufacture. At the moment when Fantine returned to M. sur M., an unheard-of transformation had taken place in the production of \"black goods.\" Towards the close of 1815 a man, a stranger, had established himself in the town, and had been inspired with the idea of substituting, in this manufacture, gum-lac for resin, and, for bracelets in particular, slides of sheet-iron simply laid together, for slides of soldered sheet-iron.\\n\\n This very small change had effected a revolution.\\n\\n This very small change had, in fact, prodigiously reduced the cost of the raw material, which had rendered it possible in the first place, to raise the price of manufacture, a benefit to the country; in the second place, to improve the workmanship, an advantage to the consumer; in the third place, to sell at a lower price, while trebling the profit, which was a benefit to the manufacturer.\\n\\n Thus three results ensued from one idea.\\n\\n In less than three years the inventor of this process had become rich, which is good, and had made every one about him rich, which is better. He was a stranger in the Department. Of his origin, nothing was known; of the beginning of his career, very little. It was rumored that he had come to town with very little money, a few hundred francs at the most.\\n\\n It was from this slender capital, enlisted in the service of an ingenious idea, developed by method and thought, that he had drawn his own fortune, and the fortune of the whole countryside.\\n\\n On his arrival at M. sur M. he had only the garments, the appearance, and the language of a workingman.\\n\\n It appears that on the very day when he made his obscure entry into the little town of M. sur M., just at nightfall, on a December evening, knapsack on back and thorn club in hand, a large fire had broken out in the town-hall. This man had rushed into the flames and saved, at the risk of his own life, two children who belonged to the captain of the gendarmerie; this is why they had forgotten to ask him for his passport. Afterwards they had learned his name. He was called Father Madeleine.\\n\\n 成什么样了？她在什么地方？干什么事呢？\\n\\n 把她的小珂赛特交给德纳第夫妇以后，她继续赶路，到了滨海蒙特勒伊。\\n\\n 我们记得，那是一八一八年。\\n\\n 芳汀离开她的故乡已有十年光景。滨海蒙特勒伊的情形早已变了。正当芳汀从一次苦难陷入另一次苦难时，她的故乡却兴盛起来了。\\n\\n 两年以来，一种轻工业在那里发展起来了，那是小地方的大事情。\\n\\n 这些细节关系很大，我们认为值得把它叙述出来。我们几乎要说，把它当作重点叙述出来。\\n\\n 从一个不可考的时代起，滨海蒙特勒伊就有一种仿造英国黑玉和德国烧料的特别工业。那种工业素来不发达，因为原料贵，影响到工资。正当芳汀回到滨海蒙特勒伊时，那种“烧料细工品”的生产已经进行了一种空前的改革。一八一五年年底有一个人，一个大家不认识的人，来住在这城里，他想到在制造中用漆胶代替松胶，特别在手镯方面，他在做底圈时，采用只把两头靠拢的方法代替那种两头连接焊死的方法。这一点极小的改革就起了很大的作用。\\n\\n 那一点极小的改革确实大大降低了原料的成本，因此，首先工资可以增高，一乡都得到了实惠；第二，制造有了改进，消费者得了好处；第三，售价可以降低，利润加了三信，厂主也得到利润。\\n\\n 因此，从一个办法得出三种结果。\\n\\n 不到三年功夫，发明这方法的人成了大富翁，那当然很好，更大的好处是他四周的人也发了财。他不是本省的人。关于他的籍贯，大众全不知道，他的往事，知道的人也不多。\\n\\n 据说他来到这城里时只有很少的钱，至多不过几百法郎。\\n\\n 他利用这一点微薄的资本来实现他精心研究出来的那种巧妙方法，他自己获得了实惠，全乡也获得了实惠。\\n\\n 他初到滨海蒙特勒伊时，他的服装、举动和谈吐都象一个工人。\\n\\n 好象在一个十二月的黄昏，他背上背个口装，手里拿根带刺的棍，摸进这滨海蒙特勒伊小城时，正遇到区公所失火。他曾跳到火里，不顾生命危险，救出两个小孩，那两个小孩恰是警察队长的儿子，因此大家都没有想到验他的护照。从那一天起，大家都知道了他的名字，他叫马德兰伯伯。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4177.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
