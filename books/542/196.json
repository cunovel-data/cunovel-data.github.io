{"id":35783,"no":196,"title":"Part 3 Book 8 Chapter 5 A Providential Peep-Hole","content":"Marius had lived for five years in poverty, in destitution, even in distress, but he now perceived that he had not known real misery. True misery he had but just had a view of. It was its spectre which had just passed before his eyes. In fact, he who has only beheld the misery of man has seen nothing; the misery of woman is what he must see; he who has seen only the misery of woman has seen nothing; he must see the misery of the child. 　\n When a man has reached his last extremity, he has reached his last resources at the same time. Woe to the defenceless beings who surround him! Work, wages, bread, fire, courage, good will, all f climbed upon the commode, put his eye to the crevice, and looked.\n ?莫 to back, in a sort of hut of fate. They exchange woe-begone glances. Oh, the unfortunate wretches! How pale they are! How cold they are! It seems as though they dwelt in a planet much further from the sun than ours. 　\n This young girl was to Marius a sort of messenger from the realm of sad shadows. She revealed to him a hideous side of the night.　\n Marius almost reproached himself for the preoccupations of revery and passion which had prevented his bestowing a glance on his neighbors up to that day. The payment of their rent had been a mechanical movement, which any one would have yielded to; but he, Marius, should have done better than that. What! only a wall separated him from those abandoned beings who lived gropingly in the dark outside the pale of the rest of the world, he was elbow to elbow with them, he was, in some sort, the last link of the human race which they touched, he heard them live, or rather, rattle in the death agony beside him, and he paid no heed to them! Every day, every instant, he heard them walking on the other side of the wall, he heard them go, and come, and speak, and he did not even lend an ear! And groans lay in those words, and he did not even listen to them, his thoughts were elsewhere, given up to dreams, to impossible radiances, to loves in the air, to follies; and all the while, human creatures, his brothers in Jesus Christ, his brothers in the people, were agonizing in vain beside him! He even formed a part of their misfortune, and he aggravated it. For if they had had another neighbor who was less chimerical and more attentive, any ordinary and charitable man, evidently their indigence would have been noticed, their signals of distress would have been perceived, and they would have been taken hold of and rescued! They appeared very corrupt and very depraved, no doubt, very vile, very odious even; but those who fall without becoming degraded are rare; besides, there is a point where the unfortunate and the infamous unite and are confounded in a single word, a fatal word, the miserable; whose fault is this? And then should not the charity be all the more profound, in proportion as the fall is great? 　\n While reading himself this moral lesson, for there were occasions on which Marius, like all truly honest hearts, was his own pedagogue and scolded himself more than he deserved, he stared at the wall which separated him from the Jondrettes, as though he were able to make his gaze, full of pity, penetrate that partition and warm these wretched people. The wall was a thin layer of plaster upheld by lathes and beams, and, as the reader had just learned, it allowed the sound of voices and words to be clearly distinguished. Only a man as dreamy as Marius could have failed to perceive this long before. There was no paper pasted on the wall, either on the side of the Jondrettes or on that of Marius; the coarse construction was visible in its nakedness. Marius examined the partition, almost unconsciously; sometimes revery examines, observes, and scrutinizes as thought would. All at once he sprang up; he had just perceived, near the top, close to the ceiling, a triangular hole, which resulted from the space between three lathes. The plaster which should have filled this cavity was missing, and by mounting on the commode, a view could be had through this aperture into the Jondrettes\u0027 attic. Commiseration has, and should have, its curiosity. This aperture formed a sort of peep-hole. It is permissible to gaze at misfortune like a traitor in order to succor it.[27]　\n [27] The peep-hole is a Judas in French. Hence the half-punning allusion.\n \"Let us get some little idea of what these people are like,\" thought Marius, \"and in what condition they are.\"\n He climbed upon the commode, put his eye to the crevice, and looked.\n 当一个男子走到穷途末路时，他同时也到了无可救药的地步。遭殃的是他周围的那些没有自卫能力的人！工作、工资、面包、火、勇气、毅力，他一下子全没有了。太阳的光仿佛已在他体外熄灭，精神的光也在他体内熄灭，在黑暗中，男子遇到妇女和孩子的软弱，便残暴地强逼她们去干污贱的勾当。\n 因此任何伤天害理的事都是可能的。绝望是由脆薄的隔板圈住的，这些隔板，每一片又都紧接着邪恶和罪行。健康，青春，尊严，幼弱圣洁的身体发肤，不甘屈辱的羞恶心情，童贞，清白，灵魂的这层护膜，都一齐遭受了这只摸索出路而碰到污秽也就安于污秽的手的穷凶极恶的蹂躏。父母、儿女、兄弟、姊妹、男子、妇人和女孩，几乎象一种矿物的结构，互相搀杂粘附在这种不分性别、血统、年龄、丑行、天真的溷浊污池里。他们彼此背靠着背，蹲在一种黑洞似的命运里。他们凄惶酸楚地面面相觑。啊，这些不幸的人们！他们的脸多么苍白！他们身上是多么冷！他们好象是住在一个比我们离太阳更远的星球上。\n 这姑娘在马吕斯看来好象是从鬼域里派来的。\n 她为他显示了黑暗世界的另一个完全不同的丑恶面。\n 马吕斯几乎谴责自己，不该那样终日神魂颠倒，不能自拔于儿女痴情，而对自己的邻居，直到如今，却还不曾瞅过一眼。为他们代付房租，那是一种机械动作，人人都能做到的，但是马吕斯应当做得更好一些。怎么！他和那几个穷苦无告的人之间只有一墙相隔，他们过着摸黑的生活，被隔绝在大众的生活之外，他和他们比邻而居，如果把人类比作链条，那么他，可以说是他们在人类中接触到的最后一环了，他听见他们在他身边生活，应当说，在他身边喘息，而他竟熟视无睹！每天，每时每刻，隔着墙，他听到他们在来回走动，说话，而他竟充耳不闻！在他们说话时，有呻吟哭泣的声音，而他竟无动于衷！他的思想在别处，在幻境中，在不可能的好梦中，在缥缈的爱情中，在痴心妄想中，可是，有一伙人。从耶稣基督来说，和他是同父弟兄，从人民来说，和他是同胞弟兄，而这些人竟在他的身旁作殊死挣扎！作绝望的殊死挣扎！他甚至是他们的苦难的因素，加深了他们的苦难。因为，假使他们有另一个邻居，一个不这么愚痴而比较关切的邻居，一个乐于为善的普通人，显然，他们的穷困情况会被注意到，苦痛的迹象会被察觉到，他们也许早已得到照顾，脱离困境了！看上去他们当然很无耻，很腐败，很肮脏，甚至很可恨，但是摔倒而不堕落的人是少有的，况且不幸的人和无耻的人往往在某一点上被人混为一谈，被加上一个笼统的名称，置人于死地的名称：无赖，这究竟是谁的过错呢？再说，难道不是在陷落越深时救援便应当越有力吗？\n 马吕斯一面这样训斥自己棗因为马吕斯和所有心地真正诚实的人一样，时常会自居于教育家的地位，对自己进行过分的责备棗，一面望着把他和容德雷特一家隔开的墙壁，仿佛他那双不胜怜悯的眼睛能穿过隔墙去温暖那些穷苦人似的。那墙是一层薄薄的敷在窄木条和小梁上的石灰，并且，我们刚才已经说过，能让人在隔壁把说话的声音和每个人的嗓音完全听得清清楚楚。只有象马吕斯那样睁着眼做梦的人才会久不察觉。墙上也没有糊纸，无论在容德雷特的一面或马吕斯的一面都是光着的，粗糙的结构赤裸裸暴露在外面。马吕斯，几乎是无意识地仔细研究着这隔层，梦想有时也能和思想一样进行研究，观察，忖度。他忽然站了起来，他刚刚发现在那上面，靠近天花板的地方，有个三角形的洞眼，是由三根木条构成的一个空隙。堵塞这空隙的石灰已经剥落，人立在抽斗柜上，便能从这窟窿看到容德雷特的破屋里。仁慈的人是有并且应当有好奇心的。这个洞眼正好是个贼眼。以贼眼窥察别人的不幸而加以援助，这是可以允许的。马吕斯想道：“何妨去看看这人家，看看他们的情况究竟是怎样的。”\n 他跳上抽斗柜，把眼睛凑近那窟窿，望着隔壁。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4333.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
