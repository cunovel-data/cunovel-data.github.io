{"id":35666,"no":79,"title":"Part 2 Book 1 Chapter 12 The Guard","content":"Every one knows the rest,--the irruption of a third army; the battle broken to pieces; eighty-six months of fire thundering simultaneously; Pirch the first coming up with Bulow; Zieten\u0027s cavalry led by Blucher in person, the French driven back; Marcognet swept from the plateau of Ohain; Durutte dislodged from Papelotte; Donzelot and Quiot retreating; Lobau caught on the flank; a fresh battle precipitating itself on our dismantled regiments at nightfall; the whole English line resuming the offensive and thrust forward; the gigantic breach made in the French army; the English grape-shot and the Prussian grape-shot aiding each other; the extermination; disaster in front; disaster on the flank; the Guard entering the line in the midst of this terrible crumbling of all things. Conscious that they were about to die, they shouted, \"Vive l\u0027Empereur!\" History records nothing more touching than that agony bursting forth in acclamations. The sky had been overcast all day long. All of a sudden, at that very moment,--it was eight o\u0027clock in the evening--the clouds on the horizon parted, and allowed the grand and sinister glow of the setting sun to pass through, athwart the elms on the Nivelles road. They had seen it rise at Austerlitz. Each battalion of the Guard was commanded by a general for this final catastrophe. Friant, Michel, Roguet, Harlet, Mallet, Poret de Morvan, were there. When the tall caps of the grenadiers of the Guard, with their large plaques bearing the eagle appeared, symmetrical, in line, tranquil, in the midst of that combat, the enemy felt a respect for France; they thought they beheld twenty victories entering the field of battle, with wings outspread, and those who were the conquerors, believing themselves to be vanquished, retreated; but Wellington shouted, \"Up, Guards, and aim straight!\" The red regiment of English guards, lying flat behind the hedges, sprang up, a cloud of grape-shot riddled the tricolored flag and whistled round our eagles; all hurled themselves forwards, and the final carnage began. In the darkness, the Imperial Guard felt the army losing ground around it, and in the vast shock of the rout it heard the desperate flight which had taken the place of the \"Vive l\u0027Empereur!\" and, with flight behind it, it continued to advance, more crushed, losing more men at every step that it took. There were none who hesitated, no timid men in its ranks. The soldier in that troop was as much of a hero as the general. Not a man was missing in that suicide. Ney, bewildered, great with all the grandeur of accepted death, offered himself to all blows in that tempest. He had his fifth horse killed under him there. Perspiring, his eyes aflame, foaming at the mouth, with uniform unbuttoned, one of his epaulets half cut off by a sword-stroke from a horseguard, his plaque with the great eagle dented by a bullet; bleeding, bemired, magnificent, a broken sword in his hand, he said, \"Come and see how a Marshal of France dies on the field of battle!\" But in vain; he did not die. He was haggard and angry. At Drouet d\u0027Erlon he hurled this question, \"Are you not going to get yourself killed?\" In the midst of all that artillery engaged in crushing a handful of men, he shouted: \"So there is nothing for me! Oh! I should like to have all these English bullets enter my bowels!\" Unhappy man, thou wert reserved for French bullets! 羽林军士知道自己去死已不远，大声喊着：“皇帝万岁！” 历史上从没有比那种忍痛的欢呼更动人的了。 那天的天气一直是阴的，那时，傍晚八点钟，天边的云忽然开朗，落日的红光阴惨惨的，从尼维尔路旁的榆树枝叶中透过来。而在奥斯特里茨的那一次，太阳却在上升。 挺身赴难的羽林军的每个营都由一个将军率领。弗里昂、米歇尔、罗格、阿尔莱、马莱、波雷·德·莫尔旺当时都在。羽林军士戴着大鹰徽高帽，行列整齐，神色镇定，个个仪表非凡，当他们在战云迷漫中出现时，敌军对法兰西也肃然起敬，他们以为看见了二十个胜利之神展开双翼，飞入战场，那些占优势的人也觉得气馁，于是向后退却，可是威灵顿喊道：“近卫军，起立，瞄准！”躺在篱后的英国红衣近卫军立了起来；一阵开花弹把我们的雄鹰四周的那些飘动着的三色旗打得满是窟窿，大家一齐冲杀，最后的血战开始了。羽林军在黑暗中觉得四周的军队已开始败退，崩溃的局势已经广泛形成，他们听见逃命的声音替代了“皇帝万岁”的呼声，但是他们后面的军队尽管退，他们自己却仍旧往前进，越走越近危险，越走越近死亡。绝没有一个人迟疑，绝没有一个人胆怯。那支军队中的士兵都和将军一样英勇。没有一个不甘愿赴死。 内伊战酣了，决心殉难，勇气长到和死神一般高，在殊死战中东奔西突，奋不顾身。他的第五匹坐骑死了。他汗流满面，眼中冒火，满唇白沫，军服没扣上，一个肩章被一个骑兵砍掉了一半，他的大鹰章也被一颗枪弹打了一个窝，浑身是血，浑身是泥，雄伟绝伦，他手举一把断剑，吼道：“你们来看看法兰西的大元帅是怎样尽忠报国的！”但是没有用，他求死不得。于是他勃然大怒，使人惊恐。他向戴尔隆发出这样的问题：“难道你不打算牺牲吗？”他在那以多凌寡的炮队中大声喊道：“我就没有一点份！哈！我愿让所有这些英国人的炮弹全钻进我的肚子！”苦命人，你是留下来吃法国人的枪弹的①！ ①内伊在战后被王朝处死。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4216.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
