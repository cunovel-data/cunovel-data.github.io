{"id":35876,"no":289,"title":"Part 5 Book 1 Chapter 9 Employment of the Old Talents of a Poacher","content":"Opinions were exchanged in the barricade. The firing from the gun was about to begin again. Against that grape-shot, they could not hold out a quarter of an hour longer. It was absolutely necessary to deaden the blows. Enjolras issued this command: \"We must place a mattress there.\" \"We have none,\" said Combeferre, \"the wounded are lying on them.\" Jean Valjean, who was seated apart on a stone post, at the corner of the tavern, with his gun between his knees, had, up to that moment, taken no part in anything that was going on. He did not appear to hear the combatants saying around him: \"Here is a gun that is doing nothing.\" At the order issued by Enjolras, he rose. It will be remembered that, on the arrival of the rabble in the Rue de la Chanvrerie, an old woman, foreseeing the bullets, had placed her mattress in front of her window. This window, an attic window, was on the roof of a six-story house situated a little beyond the barricade. The mattress, placed cross-wise, supported at the bottom on two poles for drying linen, was upheld at the top by two ropes, which, at that distance, looked like two threads, and which were attached to two nails planted in the window frames. These ropes were distinctly visible, like hairs, against the sky. \"Can some one lend me a double-barrelled rifle?\" said Jean Valjean. Enjolras, who had just re-loaded his, handed it to him. Jean Valjean took aim at the attic window and fired. One of the mattress ropes was cut. The mattress now hung by one thread only. Jean Valjean fired the second charge. The second rope lashed the panes of the attic window. The mattress slipped between the two poles and fell into the street. The barricade applauded. All voices cried: \"Here is a mattress!\" \"Yes,\" said Combeferre, \"but who will go and fetch it?\" The mattress had, in fact, fallen outside the barricade, between besiegers and besieged. Now, the death of the sergeant of artillery having exasperated the troop, the soldiers had, for several minutes, been lying flat on their stomachs behind the line of paving-stones which they had erected, and, in order to supply the forced silence of the piece, which was quiet while its service was in course of reorganization, they had opened fire on the barricade. The insurgents did not reply to this musketry, in order to spare their ammunition the fusillade broke against the barricade; but the street, which it filled, was terrible. Jean Valjean stepped out of the cut, entered the street,traversed the storm of bullets, walked up to the mattress, hoisted it upon his back, and returned to the barricade. He placed the mattress in the cut with his own hands. He fixed it there against the wall in such a manner that the artillery-men should not see it. That done, they awaited the next discharge of grape-shot. It was not long in coming. The cannon vomited forth its package of buck-shot with a roar. But there was no rebound. The effect which they had foreseen had been attained. The barricade was saved. \"Citizen,\" said Enjolras to Jean Valjean, \"the Republic thanks you.\" Bossuet admired and laughed. He exclaimed: \"It is immoral that a mattress should have so much power. Triumph of that which yields over that which strikes with lightning. But never mind, glory to the mattress which annuls a cannon!\" 安灼拉发出了这道命令： “在缺口处得放一块床垫。” “没有床垫了，”公白飞说，“上面都躺着伤员。” 冉阿让坐在较远的一块界石上，在小酒店的转角处，双腿夹着他的枪，直至目前为止，他一点也没有过问所发生的这些事。他似乎没有听见周围的战士说：“这儿有支枪不起作用。” 听到安灼拉发了命令，他站了起来。 人们记得当初来到麻厂街集合时，曾见到一个老太婆，她为了防御流弹，把她的床垫放在窗前。这是一扇阁楼的窗户，在紧靠街垒外面的一幢七层楼的屋顶上。这个床垫横放着，下端搁在两根晒衣服的杆子上，用两根绳子棗远看好象两根线棗挂在阁楼窗框的两根钉子上。绳子看得很清楚，仿沸两根头发丝悬在空中。 “谁能借一支双响的卡宾枪给我？”冉阿让说道。 安灼拉把他那支刚上了子弹的枪递给了他。 冉阿让瞄准阁楼放了一枪。 两根吊垫子的绳中的一根被打断了。 现在床垫只吊在一根绳索上。 冉阿让放第二枪。第二根绳子打了一下阁楼窗子的玻璃，床垫在两根杆子中间滑了下来，落在街上。 全街垒鼓掌叫好。 大家大声喊叫： “有一个床垫了。” “不错，”公白飞说，“但是谁去把它拿进来？” 的确，这床垫是落在街垒外边，在攻守两方的中间。此时那个炮兵中士的死亡使部队十分愤怒，士兵们都已卧倒在他们垒起的石砌的防线后面，大炮被迫沉默，需要重新安排，他们就向街垒放枪。起义者为了节省弹药，对这种排枪置之不理。那排枪打在街垒上就爆炸了，于是街上子弹横飞，非常危险。 冉阿让从缺口出去，进入街心，冒着弹雨，奔向床垫，拿起来就背回街垒。 他亲自把床垫挡住缺口，紧紧靠着墙，好让炮兵们注意不到。 做完以后，大家等待着下一次轰击。 等不多久。 大炮一声吼，喷出了一丛霰弹，但没有弹跳的情况。炮弹在床垫上流产了，产生了预期的效果，街垒保住了。 “公民，”安灼拉向冉阿让说，“共和国感谢您。” 博须埃一边笑一边赞叹道： “这很不象话，一个床垫有这么大的威力。这是谦逊战胜了暴力。无论如何，光荣应该属于床垫，它使大炮失效了。”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4426.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
