{"id":35686,"no":99,"title":"Part 2 Book 3 Chapter 11 Number 9,430 reappears, and Cosette wins it in the Lottery","content":"Jean Valjean was not dead.\n When he fell into the sea, or rather, when he threw himself into it, he was not ironed, as we have seen. He swam under water until he reached a vessel at anchor, to which a boat was moored. He found means of hiding himself in this boat until night. At night he swam off again, and reached the shore a little way from Cape Brun. There, as he did not lack money, he procured clothing. A small country-house in the neighborhood of Balaguier was at that time the dressing-room of escaped convicts,--a lucrative specialty. Then Jean Valjean, like all the sorry fugitives who are seeking to evade the vigilance of the law and social fatality, pursued an obscure and undulating itinerary. He found his first refuge at Pradeaux, near Beausset. Then he directed his course towards Grand-Villard, near Briancon, in the Hautes-Alpes. It was a fumbling and uneasy flight,-- a mole\u0027s track, whose branchings are untraceable. Later on, some trace of his passage into Ain, in the territory of Civrieux, was discovered; in the Pyrenees, at Accons; at the spot called Grange-de-Doumec, near the market of Chavailles, and in the environs of Perigueux at Brunies, canton of La Chapelle-Gonaguet. He reached Paris. We have just seen him at Montfermeil.\n His first care on arriving in Paris had been to buy mourning clothes for a little girl of from seven to eight years of age; then to procure a lodging. That done, he had betaken himself to Montfermeil. It will be remembered that already, during his preceding escape, he had made a mysterious trip thither, or somewhere in that neighborhood, of which the law had gathered an inkling.\n However, he was thought to be dead, and this still further increased the obscurity which had gathered about him. At Paris, one of the journals which chronicled the fact fell into his hands. He felt reassured and almost at peace, as though he had really been dead.\n On the evening of the day when Jean Valjean rescued Cosette from the claws of the Thenardiers, he returned to Paris. He re-entered it at nightfall, with the child, by way of the Barrier Monceaux. There he entered a cabriolet, which took him to the esplanade of the Observatoire. There he got out, paid the coachman, took Cosette by the hand, and together they directed their steps through the darkness,--through the deserted streets which adjoin the Ourcine and the Glaciere, towards the Boulevard de l\u0027Hopital.\n The day had been strange and filled with emotions for Cosette. They had eaten some bread and cheese purchased in isolated taverns, behind hedges; they had changed carriages frequently; they had travelled short distances on foot. She made no complaint, but she was weary, and Jean Valjean perceived it by the way she dragged more and more on his hand as she walked. He took her on his back. Cosette, without letting go of Catherine, laid her head on Jean Valjean\u0027s shoulder, and there fell asleep.\n 他掉在海里时，应当说，他跳到海里去时，他已脱去了脚镣，这是我们已经知道的。他在水里迂回曲折地潜到了一艘泊在港里的海船下面，海船旁又停着一只驳船。他设法在那驳船里躲了起来，一直躲到傍晚。天黑以后，他又跳下水，泅向海岸，在离勃朗岬不远的地方上了岸。他又在那里搞到一身衣服，因为他身边并不缺钱。当时在巴拉基耶附近，有一家小酒店，经常替逃犯们供给服装，这是一种一本万利的特殊行当。这之后冉阿让和所有那些企图逃避法网和社会追击的穷途末路的人一样，走上了一条隐蔽迂回的道路。他在博塞附近的普拉多地方找到了第一个藏身之所。随后，他朝着上阿尔卑斯省布里昂松附近的大维拉尔走去，这是一种摸索前进提心吊胆的逃窜，象田鼠的地道似的，究竟有哪些岔路，谁也不知道。日后才有人发现，他的足迹曾到过安省的西弗利厄地方，也到过比利牛斯省的阿贡斯，在沙瓦依村附近的都美克山峡一带，又到过佩利格附近勃鲁尼的葛纳盖教堂镇。他到了巴黎。我们刚才已看见他在孟费郿。\n 他到了巴黎。想要做的第一件事，便是替一个七八岁的小姑娘买一身丧服，再替自己找个住处。办妥了这两件事以后他便到了孟费郿。\n 我们记得，他在第一次逃脱以后曾在那地方，或在那地方附近，有过一次秘密的行动，警务机关在这方面也多少觉察到一些蛛丝马迹。\n 可是大家都认为他死了，因此更不容易看破他的秘密。他在巴黎偶然得到一张登载此事的报纸。也就放了心，而且几乎安定下来了，好象自己确是死了似的。\n 冉阿让把珂赛特从德纳第夫妇的魔爪中救出来以后，当天傍晚便回到巴黎。他带着孩子，打蒙梭便门进了城，当时天色刚黑。他在那里坐上一辆小马车到了天文台广场。他下了车，付了车钱，便牵着珂赛特的手，两人在黑夜里一同穿过乌尔辛和冰窖附近的一些荒凉街道，朝着医院路走去。\n 这一天，对珂赛特来说，是一个奇怪而充满惊恐欢乐的日子，他们在人家的篱笆后面，吃了从荒僻地方的客店里买来的面包和干酪，他们换过好几次车子，他们徒步走了不少路，她并不叫苦，可是疲倦了，冉阿让也感觉到她越走到后来便越拉住他的手。他把她驮在背上，珂赛特，怀里一直抱着卡特琳，头靠在冉阿让的肩上，睡着了。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4236.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
