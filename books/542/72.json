{"id":35659,"no":72,"title":"Part 2 Book 1 Chapter 4 A","content":"Those persons who wish to gain a clear idea of the battle of Waterloo have only to place, mentally, on the ground, a capital A. The left limb of the A is the road to Nivelles, the right limb is the road to Genappe, the tie of the A is the hollow road to Ohain from Braine-l\u0027Alleud. The top of the A is Mont-Saint-Jean, where Wellington is; the lower left tip is Hougomont, where Reille is stationed with Jerome Bonaparte; the right tip is the Belle-Alliance, where Napoleon was. At the centre of this chord is the precise point where the final word of the battle was pronounced. It was there that the lion has been placed, the involuntary symbol of the supreme heroism of the Imperial Guard.\n The triangle included in the top of the A, between the two limbs and the tie, is the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean. The dispute over this plateau constituted the whole battle. The wings of the two armies extended to the right and left of the two roads to Genappe and Nivelles; d\u0027Erlon facing Picton, Reille facing Hill.\n Behind the tip of the A, behind the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean, is the forest of Soignes.\n As for the plain itself, let the reader picture to himself a vast undulating sweep of ground; each rise commands the next rise, and all the undulations mount towards Mont-Saint-Jean, and there end in the forest.\n Two hostile troops on a field of battle are two wrestlers. It is a question of seizing the opponent round the waist. The one seeks to trip up the other. They clutch at everything: a bush is a point of support; an angle of the wall offers them a rest to the shoulder; for the lack of a hovel under whose cover they can draw up, a regiment yields its ground; an unevenness in the ground, a chance turn in the landscape, a cross-path encountered at the right moment, a grove, a ravine, can stay the heel of that colossus which is called an army, and prevent its retreat. He who quits the field is beaten; hence the necessity devolving on the responsible leader, of examining the most insignificant clump of trees, and of studying deeply the slightest relief in the ground.\n The two generals had attentively studied the plain of Mont-Saint-Jean, now called the plain of Waterloo. In the preceding year, Wellington, with the sagacity of foresight, had examined it as the possible seat of a great battle. Upon this spot, and for this duel, on the 18th of June, Wellington had the good post, Napoleon the bad post. The English army was stationed above, the French army below.\n It is almost superfluous here to sketch the appearance of Napoleon on horseback, glass in hand, upon the heights of Rossomme, at daybreak, on June 18, 1815. All the world has seen him before we can show him. That calm profile under the little three-cornered hat of the school of Brienne, that green uniform, the white revers concealing the star of the Legion of Honor, his great coat hiding his epaulets, the corner of red ribbon peeping from beneath his vest, his leather trousers, the white horse with the saddle-cloth of purple velvet bearing on the corners crowned N\u0027s and eagles, Hessian boots over silk stockings, silver spurs, the sword of Marengo,--that whole figure of the last of the Caesars is present to all imaginations, saluted with acclamations by some, severely regarded by others.\n That figure stood for a long time wholly in the light; this arose from a certain legendary dimness evolved by the majority of heroes, and which always veils the truth for a longer or shorter time; but to-day history and daylight have arrived.\n That light called history is pitiless; it possesses this peculiar and divine quality, that, pure light as it is, and precisely because it is wholly light, it often casts a shadow in places where people had hitherto beheld rays; from the same man it constructs two different phantoms, and the one attacks the other and executes justice on it, and the shadows of the despot contend with the brilliancy of the leader. Hence arises a truer measure in the definitive judgments of nations. Babylon violated lessens Alexander, Rome enchained lessens Caesar, Jerusalem murdered lessens Titus, tyranny follows the tyrant. It is a misfortune for a man to leave behind him the night which bears his form.\n ①热罗姆·波拿巴，拿破仑的八弟。\n ②指康布罗纳将军在拒绝投降时对英军说的那个“屎”字，详见下面第十四、十五节。法国人说“屎”字有如我们说“放屁”一样，有极端轻视对方的意思。　\n 从A字的尖顶到横线和左右两划中间的那个三角地带是圣约翰山高地。争夺那片高地是那次战争的全部过程。\n 两军的侧翼在热纳普路和尼维尔路上向左右两侧展开；\n 戴尔隆和皮克顿对峙，雷耶和希尔对峙。\n 在A字的尖顶和圣约翰山高地后面的，是索瓦宁森林。\n 至于那平原本身，我们可以把它想象为一片辽阔、起伏如波浪的旷地；波浪越起越高，齐向圣约翰山荡去，直到那森林。\n 战场上两军交战，正如两人角力，彼此互相搂抱。彼此都要使对方摔倒。我们对任何一点东西都不肯放松；一丛小树可以作为据点，一个墙角可以成为支柱，背后缺少一点依靠，可以使整队人马立不住足；平原上的洼地，地形的变化，一条适当的捷径，一片树林，一条山沟，都可以撑住大军的脚眼，使它不后退。谁退出战场，谁就失败。因此，负责的主帅必须细致深入地察遍每一丛小树和每一处有轻微起伏的地形。\n 两军的将领都曾仔细研究过圣约翰山平原棗今日已改称滑铁卢平原。一年以前，威灵顿便早有先见，已经考察过这地方，作了进行大战的准备。在那次决战中，六月十八日，威灵顿在那片地上占了优势，拿破仑处于劣势。英军居高，法军居下。\n 在此地描绘拿破仑于一八一五年六月十八日黎明，在罗松高地上骑着马，手里拿着望远镜的形象，那几乎是多事。在写出以前，大家早已全见过了。布里埃纳①军校的小帽下那种镇静的侧面像，那身绿色的军服，遮着勋章的白翻领，遮着肩章的灰色外衣，坎肩下的一角红丝带，皮短裤，骑匹白马，马背上覆着紫绒，紫绒角上有几个上冠皇冕的N和鹰，丝袜，长统马靴，银刺马距，马伦哥剑，在每个人的想象中都有着这副最后一个恺撒的尊容，有些人见了欢欣鼓舞，有些人见了侧目而视。 \n ①布里埃纳（Brerne），地名，拿破仑在该地军校毕业。\n 那副尊容久已处于一片光明之中，即使英雄人物也多半要受到传说的歪曲，致使真相或久或暂受到蒙蔽，但到今天，历史和真象都已大白。\n 那种真象棗历史棗是冷酷无情的。历史有这样一种特点和妙用，尽管它是光明，并且正因为它是光明，便常在光辉所到之处涂上一层阴影；它把同一个人造成两个不同的鬼物，互相攻讦，互相排斥。暴君的黑暗和统帅的荣光进行斗争。于是人民有了比较正确的定论。巴比伦被蹂躏，亚历山大的声誉有损；罗马被奴役，恺撒因而无光；耶路撒冷被屠戮，梯特为之减色。暴政随暴君而起。一个人身后曳着和他本人相似的暗影，对他而言那是一种不幸。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4209.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
