{"id":35633,"no":46,"title":"Part 1 Book 5 Chapter 7 Fauchelevent becomes a Gardener in Paris","content":"Fauchelevent had dislocated his kneepan in his fall. Father Madeleine had him conveyed to an infirmary which he had established for his workmen in the factory building itself, and which was served by two sisters of charity. On the following morning the old man found a thousand-franc bank-note on his night-stand, with these words in Father Madeleine\u0027s writing: \"I purchase your horse and cart.\" The cart was broken, and the horse was dead. Fauchelevent recovered, but his knee remained stiff. M. Madeleine, on the recommendation of the sisters of charity and of his priest, got the good man a place as gardener in a female convent in the Rue Saint-Antoine in Paris.\n Some time afterwards, M. Madeleine was appointed mayor. The first time that Javert beheld M. Madeleine clothed in the scarf which gave him authority over the town, he felt the sort of shudder which a watch-dog might experience on smelling a wolf in his master\u0027s clothes. From that time forth he avoided him as much as he possibly could. When the requirements of the service imperatively demanded it, and he could not do otherwise than meet the mayor, he addressed him with profound respect.\n This prosperity created at M. sur M. by Father Madeleine had, besides the visible signs which we have mentioned, another symptom which was none the less significant for not being visible. This never deceives. When the population suffers, when work is lacking, when there is no commerce, the tax-payer resists imposts through penury, he exhausts and oversteps his respite, and the state expends a great deal of money in the charges for compelling and collection. When work is abundant, when the country is rich and happy, the taxes are paid easily and cost the state nothing. It may be said, that there is one infallible thermometer of the public misery and riches,--the cost of collecting the taxes. In the course of seven years the expense of collecting the taxes had diminished three-fourths in the arrondissement of M. sur M., and this led to this arrondissement being frequently cited from all the rest by M. de Villele, then Minister of Finance.\n Such was the condition of the country when Fantine returned thither. No one remembered her. Fortunately, the door of M. Madeleine\u0027s factory was like the face of a friend. She presented herself there, and was admitted to the women\u0027s workroom. The trade was entirely new to Fantine; she could not be very skilful at it, and she therefore earned but little by her day\u0027s work; but it was sufficient; the problem was solved; she was earning her living.\n 过些日子，马德兰先生被任命为市长。沙威第一次看见马德兰先生披上那条表示掌握全城大权的绶带时，不禁感到浑身哆嗦，正如一只狗在它主人衣服底下嗅到了狼味。从那天起，他尽量躲避他。如果公务迫切需要非和市长见面不可，他便恭恭敬敬地和他谈话。\n 马德兰伯伯在滨海蒙特勒伊所造成的那种繁荣，除了我们已指出的那些明摆着的事实以外，还有另外一种影响，那种影响，表面上虽然看不出，也还是同等重要的。这是一点也不会错的，当人民窘困、工作缺乏、商业凋敝时，纳税人由于手头拮据，一定会拖欠税款，超过限期，政府也一定得耗费许多催缴追收的费用的。在工作很多、地方富裕、人民欢乐时，税收也就会顺利，政府也就会节省开支了。我们可以说收税费用的大小，是衡量人民贫富的一种百无一失的气温表。七年来，滨海蒙特勒伊一县的收税费用已经减了四分之三，因而当时的财政总长维莱尔①先生曾多次提到那一县的情形来和其他县份比较。 \n ①维莱尔（Villèle，1773-1854），伯爵，法国复辟时期的正统主义者，极端保王派，曾任首相（1822-1828）。　\n 芳汀回乡时，那地方的情形便是这样。家乡已没有人记得她了。幸而马德兰先生工厂的大门还象个朋友的面孔。她到那里去找工作，被安插在女车间，那种技术对芳汀来说完全是陌生的，她不可能做得很熟练，因此她从一天工作中得来的东西很有限，仅够她的生活费，但问题总算解决了。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4183.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
