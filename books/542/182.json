{"id":35769,"no":182,"title":"Part 3 Book 6 Chapter 3 Effect of the Spring","content":"One day, the air was warm, the Luxembourg was inundated with light and shade, the sky was as pure as though the angels had washed it that morning, the sparrows were giving vent to little\\n\\n twitters in the depths of the chestnut-trees. Marius had thrown open his whole soul to nature, he was not thinking of anything, he simply lived and breathed, he passed near the bench, the young girl raised her eyes to him, the two glances met.\\n\\n What was there in the young girl\u0027s glance on this occasion? Marius could not have told. There was nothing and there was everything.It was a strange flash.\\n\\n She dropped her eyes, and he pursued his way.\\n\\n What he had just seen was no longer the ingenuous and simple eye of a child; it was a mysterious gulf which had half opened, then abruptly closed again.\\n\\n There comes a day when the young girl glances in this manner. Woe to him who chances to be there!　\\n\\n That first gaze of a soul which does not, as yet, know itself, is like the dawn in the sky. It is the awakening of something radiant and strange. Nothing can give any idea of the dangerous\\n\\n charm of that unexpected gleam, which flashes suddenly and vaguely forth from adorable shadows, and which is composed of all the innocence of the present, and of all the passion of the future. It is a sort of undecided tenderness which reveals itself by chance, and which waits. It is a snare which the innocent maiden sets unknown to herself, and in which she captures hearts without either wishing or knowing it. It is a virgin looking like a woman.\\n\\n It is rare that a profound revery does not spring from that glance, where it falls. All purities and all candors meet in that celestial and fatal gleam which, more than all the best-planned tender glances of coquettes, possesses the magic power of causing the sudden blossoming, in the depths of the soul, of that sombre flower,impregnated with perfume and with poison, which is called love.　　\\n\\n That evening, on his return to his garret, Marius cast his eyes over his garments, and perceived, for the first time, that he had been so slovenly, indecorous, and inconceivably stupid as to go for his walk in the Luxembourg with his \"every-day clothes,\" that is to say, with a hat battered near the band, coarse carter\u0027s boots, black trousers which showed white at the knees, and a black coat which was pale at the elbows.\\n\\n 这次在那年轻姑娘的目光里，有了什么呢？马吕斯搞不清楚。那里面什么也没有，可是什么也全在那里了，那是一种奇特的闪光。\\n\\n 她低下了眼睛，他也继续往前走。\\n\\n 他刚才见到的，不是一个孩子的那种天真单纯的眼光，而是一种奥秘莫测的深窟，稍稍张开了一线，接着又立即关闭了。\\n\\n 每一个少女都有这样望人的一天。谁碰上了，就该谁苦恼！\\n\\n 这种连自己也莫名其妙的心灵的最初一望，有如天边的曙光。不知是种什么灿烂的东西的醒觉。这种微光，乘人不备，突然从朦胧可爱的黑夜中隐隐地显现出来，半是现在的天真，半是未来的情爱，它那危险的魅力，绝不是言语所能形容的，那是一种在期待中偶然流露的迷离惝恍的柔情。是天真于无意中设下的陷阱，勾摄了别人的心，既非出于有意，自己也并不知道。那是一个以妇人的神情望人的处子。\\n\\n 在这种目光瞥到的地方，很少能不惹起连绵的梦想。所有的纯洁感情和所有的强烈欲念都集中在这一线天外飞来、操人生死的闪光里，远非妖冶妇女做作出来的那种绝妙秋波所能及，它的魔力能使人在灵魂深处突然开出一种奇香异毒的黑花，这便是人们所说的爱。\\n\\n 那天晚上，马吕斯回到他的破屋子里，对身上的衣服望了一眼，第一次发现自己邋里邋遢，不修边幅，穿着这样的“日常”衣服，就是说，戴一顶帽边丝带附近已破裂的帽子，穿双赶车夫的大靴，一条膝头泛白的黑长裤，一件肘弯发黄的黑上衣，却要到卢森堡公园里去散步，真是荒唐透了顶。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4319.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
