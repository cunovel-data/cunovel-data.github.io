We will confine ourselves to transcribing two paragraphs published by the journals of that day, a few months after the surprising events which had taken place at M. sur M.\n These articles are rather summary. It must be remembered, that at that epoch the Gazette des Tribunaux was not yet in existence.\n We borrow the first from the Drapeau Blanc. It bears the date of July 25, 1823.\n An arrondissement of the Pas de Calais has just been the theatre of an event quite out of the ordinary course. A man, who was a stranger in the Department, and who bore the name of M. Madeleine, had, thanks to the new methods, resuscitated some years ago an ancient local industry, the manufacture of jet and of black glass trinkets. He had made his fortune in the business, and that of the arrondissement as well, we will admit. He had been appointed mayor, in recognition of his services. The police discovered that M. Madeleine was no other than an ex-convict who had broken his ban, condemned in 1796 for theft, and named Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean has been recommitted to prison. It appears that previous to his arrest he had succeeded in withdrawing from the hands of M. Laffitte, a sum of over half a million which he had lodged there, and which he had, moreover, and by perfectly legitimate means, acquired in his business. No one has been able to discover where Jean Valjean has concealed this money since his return to prison at Toulon.\n The second article, which enters a little more into detail, is an extract from the Journal de Paris, of the same date. A former convict, who had been liberated, named Jean Valjean, has just appeared before the Court of Assizes of the Var, under circumstances calculated to attract attention. This wretch had succeeded in escaping the vigilance of the police, he had changed his name, and had succeeded in getting himself appointed mayor of one of our small northern towns; in this town he had established a considerable commerce. He has at last been unmasked and arrested, thanks to the indefatigable zeal of the public prosecutor. He had for his concubine a woman of the town, who died of a shock at the moment of his arrest. This scoundrel, who is endowed with Herculean strength, found means to escape; but three or four days after his flight the police laid their hands on him once more, in Paris itself, at the very moment when he was entering one of those little vehicles which run between the capital and the village of Montfermeil (Seine-et-Oise). He is said to have profited by this interval of three or four days of liberty, to withdraw a considerable sum deposited by him with one of our leading bankers. This sum has been estimated at six or seven hundred thousand francs. If the indictment is to be trusted, he has hidden it in some place known to himself alone, and it has not been possible to lay hands on it. However that may be, the said Jean Valjean has just been brought before the Assizes of the Department of the Var as accused of highway robbery accompanied with violence, about eight years ago, on the person of one of those honest children who, as the patriarch of Ferney has said, in immortal verse,\n \". . . Arrive from Savoy every year, And who, with gentle hands, do clear Those long canals choked up with soot.\"\n This bandit refused to defend himself. It was proved by the skilful and eloquent representative of the public prosecutor, that the theft was committed in complicity with others, and that Jean Valjean was a member of a band of robbers in the south. Jean Valjean was pronounced guilty and was condemned to the death penalty in consequence. This criminal refused to lodge an appeal. The king, in his inexhaustible clemency, has deigned to commute his penalty to that of penal servitude for life. Jean Valjean was immediately taken to the prison at Toulon.\n The reader has not forgotten that Jean Valjean had religious habits at M. sur M. Some papers, among others the Constitutional, presented this commutation as a triumph of the priestly party.\n Jean Valjean changed his number in the galleys. He was called 9,430.\n However, and we will mention it at once in order that we may not be obliged to recur to the subject, the prosperity of M. sur M. Vanished with M. Madeleine; all that he had foreseen during his night of fever and hesitation was realized; lacking him, there actually was a soul lacking. After this fall, there took place at M. Sur M. that egotistical division of great existences which have fallen, that fatal dismemberment of flourishing things which is accomplished every day, obscurely, in the human community, and which history has noted only once, because it occurred after the death of Alexander. Lieutenants are crowned kings; superintendents improvise manufacturers out of themselves. Envious rivalries arose. M. Madeleine\u0027s vast workshops were shut; his buildings fell to ruin, his workmen were scattered. Some of them quitted the country, others abandoned the trade. Thenceforth, everything was done on a small scale, instead of on a grand scale; for lucre instead of the general good. There was no longer a centre; everywhere there was competition and animosity. M. Madeleine had reigned over all and directed all. No sooner had he fallen, than each pulled things to himself; the spirit of combat succeeded to the spirit of organization, bitterness to cordiality, hatred of one another to the benevolence of the founder towards all; the threads which M. Madeleine had set were tangled and broken, the methods were adulterated, the products were debased, confidence was killed; the market diminished, for lack of orders; salaries were reduced, the workshops stood still, bankruptcy arrived. And then there was nothing more for the poor. All had vanished.\n The state itself perceived that some one had been crushed somewhere. Less than four years after the judgment of the Court of Assizes establishing the identity of Jean Valjean and M. Madeleine, for the benefit of the galleys, the cost of collecting taxes had doubled in the arrondissement of M. sur M.; and M. de Villele called attention to the fact in the rostrum, in the month of February, 1827.\n 那些惨痛的经过，我们不打算一一细谈，大家想能见谅。我们只把当时滨海蒙特勒伊那一惊人事件发生几个月后报纸所刊载的两则小新闻转录下来。\n 那两节记载相当简略。我们记得，当时还没有地方法院公报。\n 第一节是从一八二三年七月二十五日的《白旗报》上录下来的：\n 加来海峡省①某县发生了一件稀有的事。有个来自他省名叫马德兰先生的人，在最近几年内，曾采用一种新方法，振兴了当地的一种旧工业，即烧料细工业。他成了当地的巨富，并且，应当说明，该县也因以致富。为了报答他的劳绩，大家举荐他当市长。不意警厅发现该马德兰先生者，原名冉阿让，系一苦役犯，一七九六年因盗案入狱，服刑期满，竟又违禁私迁。冉阿让现已重行入狱。据说他在被捕之先，曾从拉菲特银行提取存款五十万，那笔款子，一般人认为是他在商业中获得的非常合法的利润。冉阿让既已回到土伦监狱，那笔款子藏在什么地方，也就无人知晓了。 \n ①加来海峡省（PasdeCalais），滨海蒙特勒伊所在之省，在法国北部。　\n 第二节，比较详细，是从同一天的《巴黎日报》摘录下来的。\n 有个刑满释放的苦役犯名冉阿让者，最近在瓦尔省①高等法院受审，案情颇堪注意。该暴徒曾蒙蔽警察，改名换姓，并窃居我国北部某小城市长之职。他在该城经营一种商业，规模相当可观。由于公安人员的高度服务热忱，终于揭发真相，逮捕归案。他的姘妇是个公娼，已在他被捕时惊恐丧命。该犯膂力过人，曾越狱潜逃，越狱后三四日，又被警方捕获，并且是在巴黎，当时他正待走上一辆行驶在首都和孟费郿村（塞纳·瓦兹省）之间的小车。据说他曾利用那三四天的自由，从某大银行提取了大宗存款。据估计，该款达六七十万法郎。公诉状指出他已将该款藏在某处，除他之外无人知晓，因而没有被发现。总之该冉阿让已在瓦尔省高等法院受审，他被控曾手持凶器，约八年前在大路上抢劫过一个正如费尔内元老在他那流芳千古的诗句中所提及的那种诚实孩子：\n …………\n 岁岁都从萨瓦②来，\n 妙手轻轻频拂拭，\n 善为长突去煤炱。 \n ①瓦尔省（Var），土伦所在之省，在法国南部。\n ②萨瓦（Savoie），省名，靠意大利，该地的孩子多以通烟囱为业。　\n 那匪徒放弃了申诉机会。经司法诸公一番崇论雄辩之后，他那盗案已被定为累犯罪，并经指出冉阿让系南方某一匪帮的成员。因而罪证一经宣布，该冉阿让即被判处死刑。该犯拒绝上诉。国王无边宽大，恩准减为终身苦役。冉阿让立即被押赴土伦监狱。\n 我们没有忘记，冉阿让当初在滨海蒙特勒伊一贯遵守教规。因而有几种报纸，例如《立宪主义者报》便认为那次减刑应当归功于宗教界。\n 冉阿让在苦役牢里换了号码。他叫九四三○号。\n 此外，我们一次说清，以后不再提了，滨海蒙特勒伊的繁荣已随马德兰先生消失了，凡是他在那次忧心如焚、迟疑不决的夜晚所预见到的一切都成了事实，丢了他，确也就是丢了灵魂。自从他垮台以后，滨海蒙特勒伊便出现了自私自利、四分五裂的局面，那种局面原是在大事业主持人失败后所常见的，人存事业兴隆，人亡分崩离析，那种悲惨的结局，在人类社会中是每天都在暗中进行着的，历史上却只在亚历山大死后①出现过一次。部将们自封为王，工头们自称业主。竞争猜忌出现了。马德兰先生的大工厂关了门，房屋坍塌，工人四散。有的离开了本乡，有的改了行。从那以后，一切都改用小规模进行，没有大规模的了；全为利己，不以利人。失了中心，处处都是竞争，顽强的竞争。马德兰先生曾主持一切，从中指挥。他倒了，于是每个人都为自身着想；倾轧的精神代替了组合的精神，粗暴代替了赤诚，相互的仇视代替了创办人对大众的关切；马德兰先生所结的丝全乱了，断了；大家偷工减料，降低了质量，失去了信用；销路阻滞，订货减少；工资降低，工场停工，结果破产。从此穷人空无所有。一切如云烟般消散。 \n ①亚历山大死后，他所征服的领土上出现分裂割据的局面。　\n 连政府也感到在某处折了一根栋梁。自从那高等法院的判决书为了牢狱的利益，证明马德兰先生和冉阿让确是同一个人以后，不到四年，滨海蒙特勒伊一县的收税费用就增加了一倍，维莱尔先生也曾在一八二七年二月把这种情形在议会里提出过。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4224.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
