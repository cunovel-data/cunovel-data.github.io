{"id":35675,"no":88,"title":"Part 2 Book 2 Chapter 2 In which the reader will peruse Two Verses","content":"Before proceeding further, it will be to the purpose to narrate in some detail, a singular occurrence which took place at about the same epoch, in Montfermeil, and which is not lacking in coincidence with certain conjectures of the indictment. There exists in the region of Montfermeil a very ancient superstition, which is all the more curious and all the more precious, because a popular superstition in the vicinity of Paris is like an aloe in Siberia. We are among those who respect everything which is in the nature of a rare plant. Here, then, is the superstition of Montfermeil: it is thought that the devil, from time immemorial, has selected the forest as a hiding-place for his treasures. Goodwives affirm that it is no rarity to encounter at nightfall, in secluded nooks of the forest, a black man with the air of a carter or a wood-chopper, wearing wooden shoes, clad in trousers and a blouse of linen, and recognizable by the fact, that, instead of a cap or hat, he has two immense horns on his head. This ought, in fact, to render him recognizable. This man is habitually engaged in digging a hole. There are three ways of profiting by such an encounter. The first is to approach the man and speak to him. Then it is seen that the man is simply a peasant, that he appears black because it is nightfall; that he is not digging any hole whatever, but is cutting grass for his cows, and that what had been taken for horns is nothing but a dung-fork which he is carrying on his back, and whose teeth, thanks to the perspective of evening, seemed to spring from his head. The man returns home and dies within the week. The second way is to watch him, to wait until he has dug his hole, until he has filled it and has gone away; then to run with great speed to the trench, to open it once more and to seize the \"treasure\" which the black man has necessarily placed there. In this case one dies within the month. Finally, the last method is not to speak to the black man, not to look at him, and to flee at the best speed of one\u0027s legs. One then dies within the year. As all three methods are attended with their special inconveniences, the second, which at all events, presents some advantages, among others that of possessing a treasure, if only for a month, is the one most generally adopted. So bold men, who are tempted by every chance, have quite frequently, as we are assured, opened the holes excavated by the black man, and tried to rob the devil. The success of the operation appears to be but moderate. At least, if the tradition is to be believed, and in particular the two enigmatical lines in barbarous Latin, which an evil Norman monk, a bit of a sorcerer, named Tryphon has left on this subject. This Tryphon is buried at the Abbey of Saint-Georges de Bocherville, near Rouen, and toads spawn on his grave. Accordingly, enormous efforts are made. Such trenches are ordinarily extremely deep; a man sweats, digs, toils all night-- for it must be done at night; he wets his shirt, burns out his candle, breaks his mattock, and when he arrives at the bottom of the hole, when he lays his hand on the \"treasure,\" what does he find? What is the devil\u0027s treasure? A sou, sometimes a crown-piece, a stone, a skeleton, a bleeding body, sometimes a spectre folded in four like a sheet of paper in a portfolio, sometimes nothing. This is what Tryphon\u0027s verses seem to announce to the indiscreet and curious:-- \"Fodit, et in fossa thesauros condit opaca, As, nummas, lapides, cadaver, simulacra, nihilque.\" It seems that in our day there is sometimes found a powder-horn with bullets, sometimes an old pack of cards greasy and worn, which has evidently served the devil. Tryphon does not record these two finds, since Tryphon lived in the twelfth century, and since the devil does not appear to have had the wit to invent powder before Roger Bacon\u0027s time, and cards before the time of Charles VI. Moreover, if one plays at cards, one is sure to lose all that one possesses! and as for the powder in the horn, it possesses the property of making your gun burst in your face. Now, a very short time after the epoch when it seemed to the prosecuting attorney that the liberated convict Jean Valjean during his flight of several days had been prowling around Montfermeil, it was remarked in that village that a certain old road-laborer, named Boulatruelle, had \"peculiar ways\" in the forest. People thereabouts thought they knew that this Boulatruelle had been in the galleys. He was subjected to certain police supervision, and, as he could find work nowhere, the administration employed him at reduced rates as a road-mender on the cross-road from Gagny to Lagny. This Boulatruelle was a man who was viewed with disfavor by the inhabitants of the district as too respectful, too humble, too prompt in removing his cap to every one, and trembling and smiling in the presence of the gendarmes,--probably affiliated to robber bands, they said; suspected of lying in ambush at verge of copses at nightfall. The only thing in his favor was that he was a drunkard. This is what people thought they had noticed:-- Of late, Boulatruelle had taken to quitting his task of stone-breaking and care of the road at a very early hour, and to betaking himself to the forest with his pickaxe. He was encountered towards evening in the most deserted clearings, in the wildest thickets; and he had the appearance of being in search of something, and sometimes he was digging holes. The goodwives who passed took him at first for Beelzebub; then they recognized Boulatruelle, and were not in the least reassured thereby. These encounters seemed to cause Boulatruelle a lively displeasure. It was evident that he sought to hide, and that there was some mystery in what he was doing. It was said in the village: \"It is clear that the devil has appeared. Boulatruelle has seen him, and is on the search. In sooth, he is cunning enough to pocket Lucifer\u0027s hoard.\" The Voltairians added, \"Will Boulatruelle catch the devil, or will the devil catch Boulatruelle?\" The old women made a great many signs of the cross. In the meantime, Boulatruelle\u0027s manoeuvres in the forest ceased; and he resumed his regular occupation of roadmending; and people gossiped of something else. Some persons, however, were still curious, surmising that in all this there was probably no fabulous treasure of the legends, but some fine windfall of a more serious and palpable sort than the devil\u0027s bank-bills, and that the road-mender had half discovered the secret. The most \"puzzled\" were the school-master and Thenardier, the proprietor of the tavern, who was everybody\u0027s friend, and had not disdained to ally himself with Boulatruelle. \"He has been in the galleys,\" said Thenardier. \"Eh! Good God! no one knows who has been there or will be there.\" One evening the schoolmaster affirmed that in former times the law would have instituted an inquiry as to what Boulatruelle did in the forest, and that the latter would have been forced to speak, and that he would have been put to the torture in case of need, and that Boulatruelle would not have resisted the water test, for example. \"Let us put him to the wine test,\" said Thenardier. They made an effort, and got the old road-mender to drinking. Boulatruelle drank an enormous amount, but said very little. He combined with admirable art, and in masterly proportions, the thirst of a gormandizer with the discretion of a judge. Nevertheless, by dint of returning to the charge and of comparing and putting together the few obscure words which he did allow to escape him, this is what Thenardier and the schoolmaster imagined that they had made out:-- One morning, when Boulatruelle was on his way to his work, at daybreak, he had been surprised to see, at a nook of the forest in the underbrush, a shovel and a pickaxe, concealed, as one might say. However, he might have supposed that they were probably the shovel and pick of Father Six-Fours, the water-carrier, and would have thought no more about it. But, on the evening of that day, he saw, without being seen himself, as he was hidden by a large tree, \"a person who did not belong in those parts, and whom he, Boulatruelle, knew well,\" directing his steps towards the densest part of the wood. Translation by Thenardier: A comrade of the galleys. Boulatruelle obstinately refused to reveal his name. This person carried a package--something square, like a large box or a small trunk. Surprise on the part of Boulatruelle. However, it was only after the expiration of seven or eight minutes that the idea of following that \"person\" had occurred to him. But it was too late; the person was already in the thicket, night had descended, and Boulatruelle had not been able to catch up with him. Then he had adopted the course of watching for him at the edge of the woods. \"It was moonlight.\" Two or three hours later, Boulatruelle had seen this person emerge from the brushwood, carrying no longer the coffer, but a shovel and pick. Boulatruelle had allowed the person to pass, and had not dreamed of accosting him, because he said to himself that the other man was three times as strong as he was, and armed with a pickaxe, and that he would probably knock him over the head on recognizing him, and on perceiving that he was recognized. Touching effusion of two old comrades on meeting again. But the shovel and pick had served as a ray of light to Boulatruelle; he had hastened to the thicket in the morning, and had found neither shovel nor pick. From this he had drawn the inference that this person, once in the forest, had dug a hole with his pick, buried the coffer, and reclosed the hole with his shovel. Now, the coffer was too small to contain a body; therefore it contained money. Hence his researches. Boulatruelle had explored, sounded, searched the entire forest and the thicket, and had dug wherever the earth appeared to him to have been recently turned up. In vain. He had \"ferreted out\" nothing. No one in Montfermeil thought any more about it. There were only a few brave gossips, who said, \"You may be certain that the mender on the Gagny road did not take all that trouble for nothing; he was sure that the devil had come.\" 孟费郿地方有一种由来已久的迷信，在巴黎附近，居然还有一种迷信，能够传遍一方，这事的奇离可贵，也正如在西伯利亚出现了沉香。我们是那种重视稀有植物状况的人。那么，我们来谈谈孟费郿的迷信。人们都相信，魔鬼远在无可稽考的年代，便已选定当地的森林作为他藏宝的地方。婆婆妈妈们还肯定说，天快黑时，在树林里那些空旷地方，时常会出现一个黑人，面貌象个车夫或樵夫，脚上穿双木鞋，身上穿套粗布褂裤，他的特点便是他不但不戴帽子，头上还有两只其大无比的角。这一特点确实可以说明他是什么①。这人经常在地上挖洞。遇见了这种事的人，有三种应付办法。第一种，是走去找他谈话。你就会看见他只不过是个普普通通的乡下人，他黑，是因为天黑，他并不挖什么洞，而是在割喂牛的草料，他有角，那也不过是因为他背上背着一把粪叉，从暮色中远远望去，那粪叉的齿就好象是从他头上长出来的。你回到家里，一个星期之内就得死。第二种办法，就是看住他，等他挖好洞掩上土走开以后，你再赶快跑去找他挖的坑，再把它掘开来，取出那黑人必然埋在那里的“宝”。那样做，一个月以内也得死。还有第三种办法，就是绝不和那黑人谈话，也绝不望他，而是连忙逃避。一年以内也得死。 ①法国俗传魔鬼头上有角。 那三种办法都有不妥当的地方，第二种比较有利，至少可以得宝，哪怕只活一个月也值得。因此那是被采用得最广的办法。有些胆大的汉子，要钱不要命，据说他们曾不止一次，并且有凭有据，确实重行挖开那黑人所挖的洞，发了些魔鬼财。收获据说并没有什么了不起的。至少，也该相信那种由来已久的传说，而且尤其应当相信一个叫做特里丰的诺曼底僧人针对这一问题用蛮族拉丁文写的两句费解的歪诗。这僧人懂些巫术，为人凶恶，死后葬在鲁昂附近波什维尔地方的圣乔治修道院，他坟上竟生了些癞虾蟆。 那些坑，经常是挖得很深的，大家费了无穷的力气，流着汗，去搜索，整夜工作，因为那种事总是晚上做的，衬衣汗湿，蜡烛点光，锄头挖缺，等到挖到坑底，“宝物”在握时，会发现什么呢？那魔鬼的宝藏是什么呢？是一个苏，有时是一个金币、一块石头、一具枯骸、一具血淋淋的尸体，有时是个死人，一折四，就象公文包里的一张信纸，有时什么也没有。特里丰那两句歪诗所表达的和那些喜欢惹是生非的人的情形颇有些近似： 他在土坑里埋藏他的宝物， 古钱、银币、石块、尸首、塑像，空无所有。 到今天，据说有人还会找到一个火药瓶连带几粒子弹，有时也会找出一副满是油污颜色黄红的旧纸牌，那显然是魔鬼们玩过的。特里丰一点没有提到后来发现的那两种东西，因为他生在十二世纪，魔鬼们还不够聪明，不能在罗歇·培根①以前发明火药，也不能在查理六世②以前发明纸牌。 ①罗歇·培根（RogerBacon），十三世纪英国僧人。 ②查理六世（CharlesVI），十四世纪法王。 并且，如果有人拿了那种牌去赌博，他一定输到精光；至于那瓶里的火药，它的性能是把你的枪管炸在你脸上。 再说，公安人员怀疑过，那被释放了的苦役犯冉阿让，在他潜逃的那几天里，曾在孟费郿一带躲躲藏藏；过后不久，又有人注意到在同一个村子里，有个叫蒲辣秃柳儿的修路老工人，在那树林里也有些“行动”。那地方的人都说蒲辣秃柳儿坐过苦役牢，他在某些方面还受着警察的监视，由于他四处找不到工作，政府便贱价雇了他在加尼和拉尼间的那条便路上当路工。 那蒲辣秃柳儿是被当地人另眼相看的，他为人过于周到，过于谦卑，见了任何人都连忙脱帽，见了警察更一面哆嗦，一面送笑脸，有些人说他很可能和某些匪徒有联系，怀疑他一到傍晚便在一些树丛角落里打埋伏。他唯一的嗜好是醉酒。 一般人的传说是这样的： 近来蒲辣秃柳儿的铺石修路工作收工很早，他带着他的十字镐到树林里去了。有人在黄昏时遇见他在那些景荒凉的空地里，最深密的树丛里，好象在寻什么似的，有时也在地上挖洞。那些过路的婆婆妈妈们撞见了他，还以为是撞见了巴力西卜①，过后才认出是蒲辣秃柳儿，却仍旧放心不下。蒲辣秃柳儿好象也很不喜欢遇见那些过路人。他有意躲避，他显然有不可告人的隐衷。 ①巴力西卜（Belzébuth），又译“别西卜”，《圣经·马太福音》中之鬼王。 村子里有些人说：“很明显，魔鬼又出现过了。蒲辣秃柳儿看见了他，他在找。老实说，他要是能捉到个鬼王就算是了不起了。”一些没有定见的人还补充说：“不知道结果是蒲辣秃柳儿捉鬼，还是鬼捉蒲辣秃柳儿。”那些老太婆画了许多十字。 过些时候，蒲辣秃柳儿在那树林里的勾当停下来了，照旧规规矩矩做他的路工工作。大家也就谈旁的事情了。 有些人却仍在思前想后，认为那里面完全不是什么古代传说中的那种虚无缥缈的宝藏，而是一笔比鬼国银行钞票实在些、地道些的横财，那里面的秘密，一定还只被那路工发现一半。“心里最痒”的人是那小学老师和客店老板德纳第，那小学老师和任何人都有交情，对于蒲辣秃柳儿也不惜结为朋友。 “他坐过苦役牢吗？”德纳第常说，“哼！我的天主！谁也不知道今天有谁在坐牢，也没有人知道明天谁会去坐牢。” 有一天晚上，那小学老师肯定说要是在从前，官家早去调查过蒲辣秃柳儿在树林里做的那些事了，一定也向他了解过，必要时也许还要动刑，蒲辣秃柳儿大致也就供了，他决受不了，比方说，那种水刑。 “我们给他来一次酒刑。”德纳第说。 他们四个人一道，请那路工喝酒。蒲辣秃柳儿大喝了一阵，说话却不多。他以高超的艺术和老练的手法和他们周旋，既能象醉鬼那样开怀畅饮，也能象法官那样沉默寡言。可是德纳第和那小学老师一再提问，把他无意中透露出来的几句费解的话前后连贯起来，紧紧向他追逼，他们认为已了解到这样一些情况： 有一天早晨，蒲辣秃柳儿在拂晓时去上工，看见在树林的一角，一丛荆棘下面，有一把锹和一把镐，好象是别人藏在那里的。同时他想到很可能是那挑水工人西弗尔爷爷的锹和镐，也就不再细想了。可是在当天傍晚，他看见一个人从大路向那树林最密的地方走去，而他自己却不会被人家看见，因为有棵大树遮住了他，他发现“那完全不是个本乡人，并且还是他，蒲辣秃柳儿非常熟识的一个老相知”。据德纳第推测，“是个同坐苦役牢的伙伴了”。蒲辣秃柳儿坚决不肯说出那个人的姓名。那人当时掮着一包东西，方方的，象个大匣子，或是个小箱子。蒲辣秃柳儿颇为诧异。七八分钟过后，他才忽然想起要跟着那“老相知”去看看。但是已经太迟了，那老相知已走进枝叶茂密的地方，天也黑了，蒲辣秃柳儿没能跟上他。于是他决计守在树林外边窥察。“月亮上山了。”两三个钟头过后，蒲辣秃柳儿看见他那老相知又从树丛里出来，可是他现在掮的不是那只小箱，而是一把镐和一把锹。蒲辣秃柳儿让那老相知走了过去，并没有想到要去和他打交道，因为他心想那人的力气比他大三倍，还拿着镐，如果认出了他，并且发现自己已被人识破，就很可能揍死他。旧雨重逢竟如此倾心相待，真使人感叹。蒲辣秃柳儿又猛然想起早晨隐在那荆棘丛中的锹和镐，他跑去瞧，可是锹不在，镐也不在了。他从而作出结论，认为他那老相知在走进树林以后，便用他那把镐挖了一个坑，把他那箱子埋了下去，又用锹填上土，掩了那坑。况且那箱子太小，装不了一个死人，那么它装的一定是钱了。因此，他要找。蒲辣秃柳儿已把整个树林都研究过，猜测过，搜索过，凡是有新近动土迹象的地方他都翻看过。毫无所得。 他什么也没有“逮住”。在孟费郿也就没有人再去想它了。不过还有几个诚实的老婆子在说：“可以肯定，加尼的那个路工决不会无缘无故地费那么大劲，魔鬼是一定又来过了。”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4225.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
