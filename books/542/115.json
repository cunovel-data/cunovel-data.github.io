{"id":35702,"no":115,"title":"Part 2 Book 6 Chapter 2 The Obedience of Martin Verga","content":"This convent, which in 1824 had already existed for many a long year in the Rue Petit-Picpus, was a community of Bernardines of the obedience of Martin Verga.\n These Bernardines were attached, in consequence, not to Clairvaux, like the Bernardine monks, but to Citeaux, like the Benedictine monks. In other words, they were the subjects, not of Saint Bernard, but of Saint Benoit.\n Any one who has turned over old folios to any extent knows that Martin Verga founded in 1425 a congregation of Bernardines-Benedictines, with Salamanca for the head of the order, and Alcala as the branch establishment.\n This congregation had sent out branches throughout all the Catholic countries of Europe.\n There is nothing unusual in the Latin Church in these grafts of one order on another. To mention only a single order of Saint-Benoit, which is here in question: there are attached to this order, without counting the obedience of Martin Verga, four congregations,-- two in Italy, Mont-Cassin and Sainte-Justine of Padua; two in France, Cluny and Saint-Maur; and nine orders,--Vallombrosa, Granmont, the Celestins, the Camaldules, the Carthusians, the Humilies, the Olivateurs, the Silvestrins, and lastly, Citeaux; for Citeaux itself, a trunk for other orders, is only an offshoot of Saint-Benoit. Citeaux dates from Saint Robert, Abbe de Molesme, in the diocese of Langres, in 1098. Now it was in 529 that the devil, having retired to the desert of Subiaco--he was old--had he turned hermit?-- was chased from the ancient temple of Apollo, where he dwelt, by Saint-Benoit, then aged seventeen.\n After the rule of the Carmelites, who go barefoot, wear a bit of willow on their throats, and never sit down, the harshest rule is that of the Bernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga. They are clothed in black, with a guimpe, which, in accordance with the express command of Saint-Benoit, mounts to the chin. A robe of serge with large sleeves, a large woollen veil, the guimpe which mounts to the chin cut square on the breast, the band which descends over their brow to their eyes,--this is their dress. All is black except the band, which is white. The novices wear the same habit, but all in white. The professed nuns also wear a rosary at their side.\n The Bernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga practise the Perpetual Adoration, like the Benedictines called Ladies of the Holy Sacrament, who, at the beginning of this century, had two houses in Paris,-- one at the Temple, the other in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve. However, the Bernardines-Benedictines of the Petit-Picpus, of whom we are speaking, were a totally different order from the Ladies of the Holy Sacrament, cloistered in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve and at the Temple. There were numerous differences in their rule; there were some in their costume. The Bernardines-Benedictines of the Petit-Picpus wore the black guimpe, and the Benedictines of the Holy Sacrament and of the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve wore a white one, and had, besides, on their breasts, a Holy Sacrament about three inches long, in silver gilt or gilded copper. The nuns of the Petit-Picpus did not wear this Holy Sacrament. The Perpetual Adoration, which was common to the house of the Petit-Picpus and to the house of the Temple, leaves those two orders perfectly distinct. Their only resemblance lies in this practice of the Ladies of the Holy Sacrament and the Bernardines of Martin Verga, just as there existed a similarity in the study and the glorification of all the mysteries relating to the infancy, the life, and death of Jesus Christ and the Virgin, between the two orders, which were, nevertheless, widely separated, and on occasion even hostile. The Oratory of Italy, established at Florence by Philip de Neri, and the Oratory of France, established by Pierre de Berulle. The Oratory of France claimed the precedence, since Philip de Neri was only a saint, while Berulle was a cardinal.\n Let us return to the harsh Spanish rule of Martin Verga.\n The Bernardines-Benedictines of this obedience fast all the year round, abstain from meat, fast in Lent and on many other days which are peculiar to them, rise from their first sleep, from one to three o\u0027clock in the morning, to read their breviary and chant matins, sleep in all seasons between serge sheets and on straw, make no use of the bath, never light a fire, scourge themselves every Friday, observe the rule of silence, speak to each other only during the recreation hours, which are very brief, and wear drugget chemises for six months in the year, from September 14th, which is the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, until Easter. These six months are a modification: the rule says all the year, but this drugget chemise, intolerable in the heat of summer, produced fevers and nervous spasms. The use of it had to be restricted. Even with this palliation, when the nuns put on this chemise on the 14th of September, they suffer from fever for three or four days. Obedience, poverty, chastity, perseverance in their seclusion,-- these are their vows, which the rule greatly aggravates.\n The prioress is elected for three years by the mothers, who are called meres vocales because they have a voice in the chapter. A prioress can only be re-elected twice, which fixes the longest possible reign of a prioress at nine years.\n They never see the officiating priest, who is always hidden from them by a serge curtain nine feet in height. During the sermon, when the preacher is in the chapel, they drop their veils over their faces. They must always speak low, walk with their eyes on the ground and their heads bowed. One man only is allowed to enter the convent,-- the archbishop of the diocese.\n There is really one other,--the gardener. But he is always an old man, and, in order that he may always be alone in the garden, and that the nuns may be warned to avoid him, a bell is attached to his knee.\n Their submission to the prioress is absolute and passive. It is the canonical subjection in the full force of its abnegation. As at the voice of Christ, ut voci Christi, at a gesture, at the first sign, ad nutum, ad primum signum, immediately, with cheerfulness, with perseverance, with a certain blind obedience, prompte, hilariter, perseveranter et caeca quadam obedientia, as the file in the hand of the workman, quasi limam in manibus fabri, without power to read or to write without express permission, legere vel scribere non addiscerit sine expressa superioris licentia.\n adopt a tone so low that the voices of women can hardly descend to such a depth. The effect produced is striking and tragic.\n The nuns of the Petit-Picpus had made a vault under their grand altar for the burial of their community. The Government, as they say, does not permit this vault to receive coffins so they leave the convent when they die. This is an affliction to them, and causes them consternation as an infraction of the rules.\n They had obtained a mediocre consolation at best,--permission to be interred at a special hour and in a special corner in the ancient Vaugirard cemetery, which was made of land which had formerly belonged to their community.\n On Fridays the nuns hear high mass, vespers, and all the offices, as on Sunday. They scrupulously observe in addition all the little festivals unknown to people of the world, of which the Church of France was so prodigal in the olden days, and o蕠濆鄋, to make reparation or to be at the post. The nuns even prefer, out of humility, this last expression, which contains an idea of torture and abasement.\n To make reparation is a function in which the whole soul is absorbed. The sister at the post would not turn round were a thunderbolt to fall directly behind her.\n Besides this, there is always a sister kneeling before the Holy Sacrament. This station lasts an hour. They relieve each other like soldiers on guard. This is the Perpetual Adoration.\n The prioresses and the mothers almost always bear names stamped with peculiar solemnity, recalling, not the saints and martyrs, but moments in the life of Jesus Christ: as Mother Nativity, Mother Conception, Mother Presentation, Mother Passion. But the names of saints are not interdicted.\n When one sees them, one never sees anything but their mouths.\n All their teeth are yellow. No tooth-brush ever entered that convent. Brushing one\u0027s teeth is at the top of a ladder at whose bottom is the loss of one\u0027s soul.\n They never say my. They possess nothing of their own, and they must not attach themselves to anything. They call everything our; thus: our veil, our chaplet; if they were speaking of their chemise, they would say our chemise. Sometimes they grow attached to some petty object,-- to a book of hours, a relic, a medal that has been blessed. As soon as they become aware that they are growing attached to this object, they must give it up. They recall the words of Saint Therese, to whom a great lady said, as she was on the point of entering her order, \"Permit me, mother, to send for a Bible to which I am greatly attached.\" \"Ah, you are attached to something! In that case, do not enter our order!\"\n Every person whatever is forbidden to shut herself up, to have a place of her own, a chamber. They live with their cells open. When they meet, one says, \"Blessed and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar!\" The other responds, \"Forever.\" The same ceremony when one taps at the other\u0027s door. Hardly has she touched the door when a soft voice on the other side is heard to say hastily, \"Forever!\" Like all practices, this becomes mechanical by force of habit; and one sometimes says forever before the other has had time to say the rather long sentence, \"Praised and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar.\"\n Among the Visitandines the one who enters says: \"Ave Maria,\" and the one whose cell is entered says, \"Gratia plena.\" It is their way of saying good day, which is in fact full of grace.\n At each hour of the day three supplementary strokes sound from the church bell of the convent. At this signal prioress, vocal mothers, professed nuns, lay-sisters, novices, postulants, interrupt what they are saying, what they are doing, or what they are thinking, and all say in unison if it is five o\u0027clock, for instance, \"At five o\u0027clock and at all hours praised and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar!\" If it is eight o\u0027clock, \"At eight o\u0027clock and at all hours!\" and so on, according to the hour.\n This custom, the object of which is to break the thread of thought and to lead it back constantly to God, exists in many communities; the formula alone varies. Thus at The Infant Jesus they say, \"At this hour and at every hour may the love of Jesus kindle my heart!\" The Bernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga, cloistered fifty years ago at Petit-Picpus, chant the offices to a solemn psalmody, a pure Gregorian chant, and always with full voice during the whole course of the office. Everywhere in the missal where an asterisk occurs they pause, and say in a low voice, \"Jesus-Marie-Joseph.\" For the office of the dead they adopt a tone so low that the voices of women can hardly descend to such a depth. The effect produced is striking and tragic.\n The nuns of the Petit-Picpus had made a vault under their grand altar for the burial of their community. The Government, as they say, does not permit this vault to receive coffins so they leave the convent when they die. This is an affliction to them, and causes them consternation as an infraction of the rules.\n They had obtained a mediocre consolation at best,--permission to be interred at a special hour and in a special corner in the ancient Vaugirard cemetery, which was made of land which had formerly belonged to their community.\n On Fridays the nuns hear high mass, vespers, and all the offices, as on Sunday. They scrupulously observe in addition all the little festivals unknown to people of the world, of which the Church of France was so prodigal in the olden days, and of which it is still prodigal in Spain and Italy. Their stations in the chapel are interminable. As for the number and duration of their prayers we can convey no better idea of them than by quoting the ingenuous remark of one of them: \"The prayers of the postulants are frightful, the prayers of the novices are still worse, and the prayers of the professed nuns are still worse.\"\n Once a week the chapter assembles: the prioress presides; the vocal mothers assist. Each sister kneels in turn on the stones, and confesses aloud, in the presence of all, the faults and sins which she has committed during the week. The vocal mothers consult after each confession and inflict the penance aloud.\n Besides this confession in a loud tone, for which all faults in the least serious are reserved, they have for their venial offences what they call the coulpe. To make one\u0027s coulpe means to prostrate one\u0027s self flat on one\u0027s face during the office in front of the prioress until the latter, who is never called anything but our mother, notifies the culprit by a slight tap of her foot against the wood of her stall that she can rise. The coulpe or peccavi, is made for a very small matter--a broken glass, a torn veil, an involuntary delay of a few seconds at an office, a false note in church, etc. this suffices, and the coulpe is made. The coulpe is entirely spontaneous; it is the culpable person herself (the word is etymologically in its place here) who judges herself and inflicts it on herself. On festival days and Sundays four mother precentors intone the offices before a large reading-desk with four places. One day one of the mother precentors intoned a psalm beginning with Ecce, and instead of Ecce she uttered aloud the three notes do si sol; for this piece of absent-mindedness she underwent a coulpe which lasted during the whole service: what rendered the fault enormous was the fact that the chapter had laughed.\n When a nun is summoned to the parlor, even were it the prioress herself, she drops her veil, as will be remembered, so that only her mouth is visible.\n The prioress alone can hold communication with strangers. The others can see only their immediate family, and that very rarely. If, by chance, an outsider presents herself to see a nun, or one whom she has known and loved in the outer world, a regular series of negotiations is required. If it is a woman, the authorization may sometimes be granted; the nun comes, and they talk to her through the shutters, which are opened only for a mother or sister. It is unnecessary to say that permission is always refused to men.\n Such is the rule of Saint-Benoit, aggravated by Martin Verga.\n These nuns are not gay, rosy, and fresh, as the daughters of other orders often are. They are pale and grave. Between 1825 and 1830 three of them went mad.\n 因此那些伯尔纳修会的修女们，和伯尔纳修会的修士们不一样，她们不属于明谷①，而是和本笃会的修士们一样，属于西多。换句话说，她们不是圣伯尔纳的门徒，而是圣伯努瓦的门徒。\n 凡是翻过一些对开本的人都知道玛尔丹·维尔加在一四二五年创立了一个伯尔纳－本笃修会②，并以萨拉曼卡为总会会址，以阿尔卡拉③为分会会址。 \n ①伯尔纳修会是圣伯尔纳（Saint　Bernard）在公元一一一五年创立的。明谷（Clairvaux）是法国北部奥布省（Aube）的一个小镇，圣伯尔纳在那里建立了一个著名的修院。\n ②本笃会是意大利人本笃（Benedictus，约480?50），一译本尼狄克，于五二九年在意大利中部蒙特卡西诺（Monte　Cassino）建立的。西多会（Citeaux）由法国罗贝尔（Robert，1027?111）创立于第戎出（Dijon）附近的西多旷野，故名。罗贝尔主张全守本笃会严规，故西多会又称“重整本笃会”。一一一四年伯尔纳率领三十人加入后迅速发展起来，故后之建会者将伯尔纳及本笃之名连称在一起。\n ③萨拉曼卡（Salamanque）和阿尔卡拉（Alcala）都是西班牙城市。\n 那个修会的支系伸入了欧洲所有的天主教国家。\n 一个修会移植于另一修会，这在拉丁教会里并不是少见的事。这里涉及到圣伯努瓦的一系，我们就只谈谈这一系的情形，除了玛尔丹·维尔加一支不算外，和它同一系统的还有四个修会团体，两个在意大利，蒙特卡西诺和圣查斯丁·德·帕多瓦，两个在法国，克吕尼和圣摩尔；此外还有九个修会也和它同一系统，瓦隆白洛查修会，格拉蒙修会，则肋斯定修会，卡玛尔多尔修会，查尔特勒修会，卑微者修会，橄榄山派修会，西尔维斯特修会和西多修会；因为西多修会本身虽是好几个修会的发源地，对圣伯努瓦来说，它只不过是一个分支。西多修会在圣罗贝尔时代就已经存在了，圣罗贝尔在一○九八年是朗格勒主教区摩莱斯姆修院的住持。而魔鬼是在五二九年从阿波罗庙旧址被逐的，当时他已隐退到苏比阿柯沙漠（他已经老了，难道他已改邪归正了吗？），他当初是通过圣伯努瓦才住到阿波罗庙里去的，其时圣伯努瓦才十七岁。\n 圣衣会修女们赤着脚走路，颈脖上围一根柳条，也从来不坐，除了圣衣会修女们的教规以外，玛尔丹·维尔加一系的伯尔纳－本笃会修女们的教规要算是最严的了。她们全身穿黑，按照圣伯努瓦的特别规定，头兜必须兜住下巴颏儿。一件宽袖哔叽袍，一个宽大的毛质面罩，兜住下巴颏儿的头兜四方四正地垂到胸前，一条压齐眼睛的扎额巾，这便是她们的装束。除了扎额巾是白的以外，其余全是黑的。初学生穿同样的衣服，一色白。已经发愿的修女们另外还有一串念珠，挂在旁边。\n 玛尔丹·维尔加一系的伯尔纳－本笃会修女们，和那些所谓圣事嬷嬷的本笃会修女们一样，都修永敬仪规，本笃会的修女们，本世纪初，在巴黎有两处修院，一处在大庙，一处在圣热纳维埃夫新街。可是我们现在所谈的小比克布斯的伯尔纳－本笃会修女们，和那些在圣热纳维埃夫新街和大庙出家的圣事嬷嬷们绝对不属于同一个修会。在教规方面有许多不同的地方，在服装方面也有许多不同的地方。小比克布斯的伯尔纳－本笃会修女们戴黑头兜，圣热纳维埃夫新街的本笃会的圣事嬷嬷们却戴白头兜，胸前还挂一个三寸来高银质镀金或铜质镀金的圣体。小比克布斯的修女们从来不挂那种圣体。小比克布斯的修院和大庙的修院都一样修永敬仪规，但是绝不可因这件事而把两个修院混为一谈。关于这一仪式，圣事嬷嬷们和玛尔丹·维尔加系的伯尔纳会的修女们之间，只是貌似而已，正如菲力浦·德·内里在佛罗伦萨设立的意大利经堂和皮埃尔·德·贝鲁尔在巴黎设立的法兰西经堂原是两个截然不同的有时甚至还互相仇视的修会，可是在有关耶稣基督的童年、生活和死以及有关圣母的种种神异的研究和颂扬方面，两个修会之间却有着共同之处。巴黎经堂自居于领先地位，因为菲力浦·德·内里只是个圣者，而贝鲁尔却是个红衣主教。\n 我们再回到玛尔丹·维尔加的西班牙型严厉的教规上来。\n 这一支系的伯尔纳－本笃会的修女们整年素食，在封斋节和她们特定的其他许多节日里还得绝食，晚上睡一会儿便得起床，从早晨一点开始念日课经，唱早祈祷，直到三点；一年四季都睡在哔叽被单里和麦秸上，从来不洗澡不烤火，每星期五自我检查纪律，遵守保持肃静的教规，只在课间休息时才谈话，那种休息也是极短的，从九月十四日举荣圣架节到复活节，每年得穿六个月的棕色粗呢衬衫。这六个月并且是一种通融办法，按照规定是整年，可是那种棕色粗呢衬衫在炎热的夏季里是受不了的，经常引起热病和神经性痉挛症，因而必须限制使用期。即使有了这种照顾，修女们在九月十四日穿上那种衬衫，也得发上三四天烧。服从，清苦，寡欲，稳定在寺院里，这是她们发的愿，教规却把她们的心愿歪曲成沉重的担子。\n 院长的任期是三年，由嬷嬷们选举，参加选举的嬷嬷叫做“参议嬷嬷”，因为她们在宗教事务会议里有发言权。院长只能连任两次，因此一个院长的任期最长也只能九年。\n 她们从不和主祭神甫见面，她们和主祭神甫之间总挂着一道七尺高的哔叽。宣道士走上圣坛讲经时，她们便拉下面罩遮住脸。任何时候她们都得低声说话，走路时她们也得低看头，眼睛望着地。只有一个男人可以进这修院，就是本教区的大主教。\n 另外确也还有一个男人，就是园丁，可是那园丁必须是个老年人，并且为了让他永远独自一人住在园子里，为了修女们能及时避开他，便在他膝上挂一个铃铛。\n 她们对院长是绝对服从的。这是教律所要求的那种百依百顺的牺牲精神。有如亲承基督之命（ut　voci　Christi）①，察言观色，会意立行（ad　nutum，ad　primum　signum），敏捷，愉快，坚忍，绝对服从（prompte，hilariter，perseveranter，et　coecaet　quadam　obedientia），有如工人手中的锉（quasi　limam　in　manibus　fabri），没有明确的许可，便不能读也不能写任何东西（legere　vel　scribere　non　adiscerit　sine　expressa　superioris　licentia）。 \n ①这里及以下括弧内的每句拉丁文的意义都和它前面的译文相同。　\n 她们中的每个人都得轮流举行她们的所谓“赎罪礼”。赎罪礼是一种替世人赎免一切过失、一切错误、一切纷扰、一切强暴、一切不义、一切犯罪行为的祈祷。举行“赎罪礼”的修女得连续十二个小时，从傍晚四点到早晨四点，或是从早晨四点到傍晚四点，跪在圣体前面的一块石板上，合掌，颈上有根绳子，累到支持不住时，便全身伏在地上，面朝地，两臂伸出，成十字形，这是唯一的休息方法。在这样一种姿势里，修女替天下所有的罪人祈祷，简直伟大到了卓绝的程度。\n 这种仪式是在一根木柱前举行的，柱子顶上点一支白蜡烛，因此她们随意将它称为“行赎罪礼”或“跪柱子”。修女们，由于自卑心理，更乐于采用第二种说法，因为它含有受罪和受辱的意义①。 \n ①耶稣曾被绑在柱子上。\n “行赎罪礼”得全神贯注。柱子跟前的修女，即使知道有雷火落在她背后，也不会转过头去望一下的。\n 此外，圣体前总得有个修女跪着。每班跪一小时。她们象兵士站岗一样，轮流换班。这就是所谓永敬。\n 院长和嬷嬷几乎人人都要取一个意义特别重大的名字，这些名字不取义于圣者和殉道者的身世，而是出自耶稣基督一生中的某些事迹，例如降生嬷嬷、始孕嬷嬷、奉献嬷嬷、苦难嬷嬷。但并不禁止袭用圣者的名字。\n 别人和她们见面时，从来就只看见她们的一张嘴。她们每个人的牙全是黄的。从来不曾有过一把牙刷进过这修院的门。\n 刷牙，在各级断送灵魂的罪过里是属于最高级的。\n 她们对任何东西从来不说“我的”。她们没有任何属于自己的东西，也没有任何舍不得的东西。她们对一切东西都说“我们的”，如我们的面罩、我们的念珠，如果她们谈到自己的衬衫，也说“我们的衬衫”。有时她们也会爱上一些小物件，一本日课经、一件遗物、一个祝福过的纪念章。她们一发现自己开始对某件东西有点恋恋不舍时，就得拿它送给旁人。她们时常回忆圣泰雷丝的这段话：有个贵妇人在加入圣泰雷丝修会时对她说：“我的嬷嬷，请允许我派人去把一本圣经找来，我很舍不得它。”\n “啊！您还有舍不得的东西！既是这样，您就不用到我们这里来！”\n 任何人都不得把自己单独关在屋子里，也不许有一个“她的环境”，一间“房间”。她们开着牢门过日子。她们在彼此接触时，一个说：“愿祭台上最崇高的圣体受到赞叹和崇拜！”另一个便回答说：“永远如此。”在敲别人的房门时，也用这同一礼节。门还没有怎么敲响，屋子里柔和的声音便已急急忙忙说出了“永远如此！”这和其他一切行为一样，成了习惯以后便变为机械的动作了，有时候，这一个的“永远如此”早已脱口而出，而对方还没来得及说完那句相当冗长的“愿祭台上最崇高的圣体受到赞叹和崇拜！”\n 访问会的修女们，在走进别人屋子时说：“赞美马利亚”，在屋里迎接的人说“仪态万方”。这是她们互相道好的方式，也确实是仪态万方。\n 每到一个钟点，这修院的礼拜堂上的钟都要多敲三下。听了这信号以后，院长、参议嬷嬷、发愿修女、服务修女、初学生①、备修生②都要把她们所谈所作所想的事一齐放下，并且大家一齐……如果是五点钟，便齐声说：“在五点钟和每点钟，愿祭台上最崇高的圣体受到赞叹和崇拜！”如果是六点钟，便说：“在六点钟和每点钟……”其他时间，都随着钟点以此类推。\n 这种习惯，目的在于打断人的思想，随时把它引向上帝，许多教会都有这种习惯，不过公式各各不同而已。例如，在圣子耶稣修会里便这样说：“在这个钟点和每个钟点，愿天主的宠爱振奋我的心！”\n 五十年前，在小比克布斯隐修的玛尔丹·维尔加系的伯尔纳－本笃会修女们在唱日课经时，都用一种低沉的音调唱着圣歌，地道的平咏颂③，并且还得用饱满的嗓音从日课开始一直唱到课终，可是对弥撒经本上印有星号的地方，她们便停止歌唱，只低声念着“耶稣棗马利亚棗约瑟”。在为死人举行祭礼时，她们的音调更加低沉，低到几乎是女声所不能达到的音域，那样能产生一种凄切动人的效果。 \n ①初学生是已结束备修阶段，但尚未发愿的修女或修士。\n ②备修生是请求入院修道的初级修女或修士。\n ③平咏颂（plain－chant），欧洲中世纪的宗教音乐，旋律很少起伏。\n 　小比克布斯的修女们曾在她们的正祭台下建造了一个地窖，想当作修院安置灵柩的地方。但是“政府”……这是她们说的，不准在地窖里停柩。因此她们死了，还得出院。她们为这事感到痛心，好象受了非法的干涉，一直惴惴不安。\n 她们只得到一种微不足道的安慰，在从前的伏吉拉尔公墓里，有一块地原是属于她们这修院的，她们获得批准，死后可以在一个特定的钟点葬在这公墓里一个指定的角上。\n 那些修女们在星期四和在星期日一样，得做大弥撒、晚祈祷和其他一切日课。除此以外，她们还得严格遵守一切小节日，那些小节日几乎是局外人所不知道的，在从前的法国教会里很盛行，到现在只在西班牙和意大利的教会里盛行了。她们无时无刻不守在圣坛上。为了说明她们祈祷的次数和每次祈祷延续的时间，最好是引用她们中某一个所说的一句天真话：“备修生的祈祷吓得坏人，初学生的祈祷更吓坏人，发愿修女的祈祷更更吓坏人。”\n 她们每星期集合一次，院长主持，参议嬷嬷们出席。修女一个个顺序走去跪在石板上，当着大众的面，大声交代她在这星期里所犯的大小过失。参议嬷嬷们听了一个人的交代以后，便交换意见，高声宣布惩罚的办法。\n 在大声交代的过失外，还有所谓补赎轻微过失的补赎礼。行补赎礼，便是在进行日课时，五体投地伏在院长的跟前，直到院长棗她们在任何时候都称院长为“我们的嬷嬷”，从来不用旁的称呼棗在她的神职祷告席上轻轻敲一下，才可以立起来。为了一点极小的事也要行补赎礼，打破一只玻璃杯，撕裂一个面罩，做日课时漫不经心迟到了几秒钟，在礼拜堂里唱走了一个音，诸如此类的事都已够行补赎礼了。行补赎礼是完全自发的，由罪人棗从字源学出发，这个字①用在此地是适当的棗自己反省，自己处罚。在节日和星期日，有四个唱诗嬷嬷在唱诗台上的四个谱架前随着日课歌唱圣诗。一天，有个唱诗嬷嬷在唱一首圣诗时，那首诗原是以“看呵”开始的，但是她没有唱“看呵”而是大声唱了“多，西，梭”这三个音，由于这一疏忽，她就行了一场和日课同始同终的补赎礼。她这过失之所以严重，是因为在场的修女们个个都笑了。 \n ①指coulpe（补赎礼）和coupable（罪人）两字同出于拉丁文coulpa。\n 修女被请到会客室去时，即使是院长，我们记得，也得放下面罩，只能把嘴露在外面。\n 只有院长一人可以和外界的人交谈。其余的人都只能接见最亲的家人，见面的机会也极少。万一有个外面的人要访问一个曾在社交中相识或喜欢的修女，就非千求万恳不行。要是这是一个女人，有时可以得到允许，那修女便走来和她隔着板窗谈话，除了母女和姊妹相见以外，那板窗是从来不开的。男人来访问当然一概拒绝。\n 这是圣伯努瓦定出的教规，可是已被玛尔丹·维尔加改得更加严厉了。\n 这里的修女们，和其他修会里的姑娘们不一样，一点也不活泼红润。她们面色苍白，神情沉郁。从一八二五年到一八三○年就疯了三个。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4252.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les
