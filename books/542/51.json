{"id":35638,"no":51,"title":"Part 1 Book 6 Chapter 1 The Beginning of Repose","content":"M. Madeleine had Fantine removed to that infirmary which he had established in his own house. He confided her to the sisters, who put her to bed. A burning fever had \n come on. She passed a part of the night in delirium and raving. At length, however, she fell asleep.\n On the morrow, towards midday, Fantine awoke. She heard some one breathing close to her bed; she drew aside the curtain and saw M. Madeleine standing there and looking \n at something over her head. His gaze was full of pity, anguish, and supplication. She followed its direction, and saw that it was fixed on a crucifix which was nailed \n to the wall.\n Thenceforth, M. Madeleine was transfigured in Fantine\u0027s eyes. He seemed to her to be clothed in light. He was absorbed in a sort of prayer. She gazed at him for a long \n time without daring to interrupt him. At last she said timidly:--\n \"What are you doing?\"\n M. Madeleine had been there for an hour. He had been waiting for Fantine to awake. He took her hand, felt of her pulse, and replied:--\n \"How do you feel?\"\n \"Well, I have slept,\" she replied; \"I think that I am better, It is nothing.\"\n He answered, responding to the first question which she had put to him as though he had just heard it:--\n \"I was praying to the martyr there on high.\"\n And he added in his own mind, \"For the martyr here below.\"\n M. Madeleine had passed the night and the morning in making inquiries. He knew all now. He knew Fantine\u0027s history in all its heart-rending details. He went on:--\n \"You have suffered much, poor mother. Oh! do not complain; you now have the dowry of the elect. It is thus that men are transformed into angels. It is not their fault \n they do not know how to go to work otherwise. You see this hell from which you have just emerged is the first form of heaven. It was necessary to begin there.\"\n He sighed deeply. But she smiled on him with that sublime smile in which two teeth were lacking.\n That same night, Javert wrote a letter. The next morning be posted it himself at the office of M. sur M. It was addressed to Paris, and the superscription ran: To \n Monsieur Chabouillet, Secretary of Monsieur le Prefet of Police. As the affair in the station-house had been bruited about, the post-mistress and some other persons who \n saw the letter before it was sent off, and who recognized Javert\u0027s handwriting on the cover, thought that he was sending in his resignation.\n M.Madeleine made haste to write to the Thenardiers. Fantine owed them one hundred and twenty francs. He sent them three hundred francs, telling them to pay themselves \n from that sum, and to fetch the child instantly to M. sur M., where her sick mother required her presence.\n This dazzled Thenardier. \"The devil!\" said the man to his wife; \"don\u0027t let\u0027s allow the child to go. This lark is going to turn into a milch cow. I see through it. Some \n ninny has taken a fancy to the mother.\"\n He replied with a very well drawn-up bill for five hundred and some odd francs. In this memorandum two indisputable items figured up over three hundred francs,--one for \n the doctor, the other for the apothecary who had attended and physicked Eponine and Azelma through two long illnesses. Cosette, as we have already said, had not been \n ill. It was only a question of a trifling substitution of names. At the foot of the memorandum Thenardier wrote, Received on account, three hundred francs.\n M. Madeleine immediately sent three hundred francs more, and wrote, \"Make haste to bring Cosette.\"\n \"Christi!\" said Thenardier, \"let\u0027s not give up the child.\"\n In the meantime, Fantine did not recover. She still remained in the infirmary.\n The sisters had at first only received and nursed \"that woman\" with repugnance. Those who have seen the bas-reliefs of Rheims will recall the inflation of the lower lip \n of the wise virgins as they survey the foolish virgins. The ancient scorn of the vestals for the ambubajae is one of the most profound instincts of feminine dignity; \n the sisters felt it with the double force contributed by religion. But in a few days Fantine disarmed them. She said all kinds of humble and gentle things, and the \n mother in her provoked tenderness. One day the sisters heard her say amid her fever: \"I have been a sinner; but when I have my child beside me, it will be a sign that \n God has pardoned me. While I was leading a bad life, I should not have liked to have my Cosette with me; I could not have borne her sad, astonished eyes. It was for her \n sake that I did evil, and that is why God pardons me. I shall feel the benediction of the good God when Cosette is here. I shall gaze at her; it will do me good to see \n that innocent creature. She knows nothing at all. She is an angel, you see, my sisters. At that age the wings have not fallen off.\"\n M. Madeleine went to see her twice a day, and each time she asked him:--\n \"Shall I see my Cosette soon?\"\n He answered:--\n \"To-morrow, perhaps. She may arrive at any moment. I am expecting her.\"\n And the mother\u0027s pale face grew radiant.\n \"Oh!\" she said, \"how happy I am going to be!\"\n We have just said that she did not recover her health. On the contrary, her condition seemed to become more grave from week to week. That handful of snow applied to her \n bare skin between her shoulder-blades had brought about a sudden suppression of perspiration, as a consequence of which the malady which had been smouldering within her \n for many years was violently developed at last. At that time people were beginning to follow the fine Laennec\u0027s fine suggestions in the study and treatment of chest \n maladies. The doctor sounded Fantine\u0027s chest and shook his head.\n M. Madeleine said to the doctor:--\n \"Well?\"\n \"Has she not a child which she desires to see?\" said the doctor.\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Well! Make haste and get it here!\"\n M. Madeleine shuddered.\n Fantine inquired:--\n \"What did the doctor say?\"\n M. Madeleine forced himself to smile.\n \"He said that your child was to be brought speedily. That that would restore your health.\"\n \"Oh!\" she rejoined, \"he is right! But what do those Thenardiers mean by keeping my Cosette from me! Oh! she is coming. At last I behold happiness close beside me!\"\n In the meantime Thenardier did not \"let go of the child,\" and gave a hundred insufficient reasons for it. Cosette was not quite well enough to take a journey in the \n winter. And then, there still remained some petty but pressing debts in the neighborhood, and they were collecting the bills for them, etc., etc.\n \"I shall send some one to fetch Cosette!\" said Father Madeleine. \"If necessary, I will go myself.\"\n He wrote the following letter to Fantine\u0027s dictation, and made her sign it:--\n \"MONSIEUR THENARDIER:--\n You will deliver Cosette to this person.\n You will be paid for all the little things.\n I have the honor to salute you with respect.\n \"FANTINE.\"\n In the meantime a serious incident occurred. Carve as we will the mysterious block of which our life is made, the black vein of destiny constantly reappears in it.\n 快到第二天中午，芳汀醒来了，她听见在她床边有人呼吸，她拉起床帷，看见马德兰先生立在那里，望着她头边的一件东西。他的目光充满着怜悯沉痛的神情，他正在一心祈祷。她循着他的视\n 线望去，看见他正对着悬在墙上的一个耶稣受难像祈祷。\n 从此马德兰先生在芳汀的心目中是另外一个人了。她觉得他浑身周围有层光。他当时完全沉浸在祈祷里。她望了他许久，不敢惊动他。到后来，她才细声向他说：\n “您在那儿做什么？”\n 马德兰先生立在那地方已一个钟头了。他等待芳汀醒来。\n 他握着她的手，试了她的脉博，说道：\n “您感到怎样？”\n “我好，我睡了好一阵，”她说，“我觉得我好一些了，不久就没事了。”\n 他回答她先头的问题，好象他还听见她在问似的：\n “我为天上的那位殉难者祈祷。”\n 在他心里，他还加了一句：“也为地下的这位殉难者。”\n 马德兰先生调查了一夜又一个早晨。现在他完全明白了。\n 他知道了芳汀身世中一切痛心的细情。\n 他接着说：\n “您很受了些痛苦，可怜的慈母。呵！您不用叫苦，现在您已取得做永生极乐之神的资格。这便是人成天使的道路。这并不是人的错处，人不知道有旁的办法。您懂吗？您脱离的那个地狱正是\n 天堂的第一种形式。应当从那地方走起。”\n 他深深地叹了一口气。至于她，她带着那种缺了两个牙的绝美的笑容向他微笑。\n 沙威在当天晚上写了一封信。第二天早晨，他亲自把那封信送到滨海蒙特勒伊邮局。那封信是寄到巴黎去的，上面写着这样的字：“呈警署署长先生的秘书夏布耶先生”。因为警署里的那件事\n 已经传出去了，邮局的女局长和其他几个人在寄出以前看见了那封信，并从地址上认出了沙威的笔迹，都以为他寄出的是辞职书。\n 马德兰先生赶紧写了一封信给德纳弟夫妇。芳汀欠他们一百二十法郎。他寄给他们三百法郎，嘱咐他们在那数目里扣还，并且立刻把那孩子送到滨海蒙特勒伊来，因为她的母亲在害病，要看她\n 。\n 德纳第喜出望外。“撞到了鬼！”他向他的婆娘说，“我们别放走这孩子。这个小百灵鸟快要变成有奶的牛了。我猜到了。\n 一定有一个冤桶爱上了她的妈。”\n 他寄回一张造得非常精密的五百○几个法郎的账单。账单里还附了两张毫无问题的收据，一共三百多法郎，一张是医生开的，一张是药剂师开的，他们诊治过爱潘妮和阿兹玛的两场长病。珂赛\n 特，我们说了，没有病过。那不过是一件小小的冒名顶替的事罢了。德纳第在账单下面写道：“内收三百法郎。”\n 马德兰先生立刻又寄去三百法郎，并且写道：“快把珂赛特送来。”\n “还了得！”德纳第说，“我们别放走这孩子。”\n 但是芳汀的病一点没有起色。她始终留在那间养病室里。那些姆姆当初接收并照顾“这姑娘”，心里都有些反感。凡是见过兰斯①地方那些浮雕的人，都记得那些贞女怎样鼓着下嘴唇去看那些\n 疯处女的神情。贞女对荡妇的那种自古已然的蔑视，是妇德中一种最悠久的本能；那些姆姆们心中的蔑视，更因宗教的关系而倍加浓厚了。但是，不到几天，芳汀便把她们降服了。她有多种多\n 样的谦恭和蔼的语言，她那慈母心肠更足以使人心软。一天，姆姆们听见她在发烧时说：“我做了个犯罪的人，但等我有了自己的孩子在身边，那就可以证明上帝已经赦免我的罪了，我生活在\n 罪恶中时，我不愿珂赛特和我在一起，我会受不了她那双惊奇愁苦的眼睛。不过我是为了她才作坏事的，这一点让我得到上帝的赦免吧。珂赛特到了此地时，我就会感到上帝的保佑。那孩子是\n 没有罪的，我望着她，我就得到了安慰。她什么都不知道。她是一个安琪儿，你们看吧，我的姆姆们，在她那样小小的年纪，翅膀是不会掉的。” \n ①兰斯（Reims），法国东北部城市，有一个著名的大天主堂。　\n 马德兰先生每天去看她两次，每次她都要问他说：\n “我不久就可以看见我的珂赛特了吧？”\n 他老回答她说：\n “也许就在明天早晨。她随时都可以到，我正等着她呢。”\n 于是那母亲的惨白面容也开朗了。\n “呵！”她说，“我可就快乐了。”\n 我们刚才说过，她的病没有起色，并且她的状况仿佛一星期比一星期更沉重了。那一把雪是贴肉塞在她两块肩胛骨中间的，那样突然的一阵冷，立刻停止了她发汗的机能，因而几年以来潜伏在\n 她体中的病，终于急剧恶化了。当时大家正开始采用劳安内克①杰出的指示，对肺病进行研究和治疗。医生听过芳汀的肺部以后，摇了摇头。 \n ①劳安内克（LaeBnnec，1781-1826），法国医生，听诊方法的发明者。　\n 马德兰先生问那医生：\n “怎样？”\n “她不是有个孩子想看看吗？”医生说。\n “是的。”\n “那么赶快接她来吧。”\n 马德兰先生吃了一惊。\n 芳汀问他说：\n “医生说了什么话？”\n 马德兰先生勉强微笑着。\n “他说快把您的孩子接来，您的身体就好了。”\n “呵！”她回答说，“他说得对！但是那德纳第家有什么事要留住我的珂赛特呢？呵！她就会来的。现在我总算看见幸福的日子就在我眼前了。”\n 但是德纳第不肯“放走那孩子”，并且找了各种不成理由的借口。珂赛特有点不舒服，冬季不宜上路，并且在那地方还有一些零用债务急待了清，他正在收取发票等等。\n “我可以派个人去接珂赛特，”马德兰伯伯说。“在必要时，我还可以自己去。”\n 他照着芳汀的口述，写了这样一封信，又叫她签了名：\n 德纳第先生：\n 请将珂赛特交来人。\n 一切零星债款，我负责偿还。\n 此颂大安。\n 芳汀\n 正在这关头，发生了一件大事。我们枉费心机，想凿通人生旅途中的障碍，可是命中的厄运始终是要出现的。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4188.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
