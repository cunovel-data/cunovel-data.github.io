{"id":35827,"no":240,"title":"Part 4 Book 7 Chapter 4 The Two Duties: To Watch and to Hope","content":"This being the case, is all social danger dispelled? Certainly not. There is no Jacquerie; society may rest assured on that point; blood will no longer rush to its head. But let society take heed to the manner in which it breathes. Apoplexy is no longer to be feared, but phthisis is there. Social phthisis is called misery. One can perish from being undermined as well as from being struck by lightning. Let us not weary of repeating, and sympathetic souls must not forget that this is the first of fraternal obligations, and selfish hearts must understand that the first of political necessities consists in thinking first of all of the disinherited and sorrowing throngs, in solacing, airing, enlightening, loving them, in enlarging their horizon to a magnificent extent, in lavishing upon them education in every form, in offering them the example of labor, never the example of idleness, in diminishing the individual burden by enlarging the notion of the universal aim, in setting a limit to poverty without setting a limit to wealth, in creating vast fields of public and popular activity, in having, like Briareus, a hundred hands to extend in all directions to the oppressed and the feeble, in employing the collective power for that grand duty of opening workshops for all arms, schools for all aptitudes, and laboratories for all degrees of intelligence, in augmenting salaries, diminishing trouble, balancing what should be and what is, that is to say, in proportioning enjoyment to effort and a glut to need; in a word, in evolving from the social apparatus more light and more comfort for the benefit of those who suffer and those who are ignorant. And, let us say it, all this is but the beginning. The true question is this: labor cannot be a law without being a right. We will not insist upon this point; this is not the proper place for that. If nature calls itself Providence, society should call itself foresight. Intellectual and moral growth is no less indispensable than material improvement. To know is a sacrament, to think is the prime necessity, truth is nourishment as well as grain. A reason which fasts from science and wisdom grows thin. Let us enter equal complaint against stomachs and minds which do not eat. If there is anything more heart-breaking than a body perishing for lack of bread, it is a soul which is dying from hunger for the light. The whole of progress tends in the direction of solution. Some day we shall be amazed. As the human race mounts upward, the deep layers emerge naturally from the zone of distress. The obliteration of misery will be accomplished by a simple elevation of level. We should do wrong were we to doubt this blessed consummation. The past is very strong, it is true, at the present moment. It censures. This rejuvenation of a corpse is surprising. Behold, it is walking and advancing. It seems a victor; this dead body is a conqueror. He arrives with his legions, superstitions, with his sword, despotism, with his banner, ignorance; a while ago, he won ten battles. He advances, he threatens, he laughs, he is at our doors. Let us not despair, on our side. Let us sell the field on which Hannibal is encamped. What have we to fear, we who believe? No such thing as a back-flow of ideas exists any more than there exists a return of a river on its course. But let those who do not desire a future reflect on this matter. When they say \"no\" to progress, it is not the future but themselves that they are condemning. They are giving themselves a sad malady; they are inoculating themselves with the past. There is but one way of rejecting To-morrow, and that is to die. Now, no death, that of the body as late as possible, that of the soul never,--this is what we desire. Yes, the enigma will utter its word, the sphinx will speak, the problem will be solved. Yes, the people, sketched out by the eighteenth century, will be finished by the nineteenth. He who doubts this is an idiot! The future blossoming, the near blossoming forth of universal well-being, is a divinely fatal phenomenon. Immense combined propulsions direct human affairs and conduct them within a given time to a logical state, that is to say, to a state of equilibrium; that is to say, to equity. A force composed of earth and heaven results from humanity and governs it; this force is a worker of miracles; marvellous issues are no more difficult to it than extraordinary vicissitudes. Aided by science, which comes from one man, and by the event, which comes from another, it is not greatly alarmed by these contradictions in the attitude of problems, which seem impossibilities to the vulgar herd. It is no less skilful at causing a solution to spring forth from the reconciliation of ideas, than a lesson from the reconciliation of facts, and we may expect anything from that mysterious power of progress, which brought the Orient and the Occident face to face one fine day, in the depths of a sepulchre, and made the imaums converse with Bonaparte in the interior of the Great Pyramid. In the meantime, let there be no halt, no hesitation, no pause in the grandiose onward march of minds. Social philosophy consists essentially in science and peace. Its object is, and its result must be, to dissolve wrath by the study of antagonisms. It examines, it scrutinizes, it analyzes; then it puts together once more, it proceeds by means of reduction, discarding all hatred. More than once, a society has been seen to give way before the wind which is let loose upon mankind; history is full of the shipwrecks of nations and empires; manners, customs, laws, religions,--and some fine day that unknown force, the hurricane, passes by and bears them all away. The civilizations of India, of Chaldea, of Persia, of Syria, of Egypt, have disappeared one after the other. Why? We know not. What are the causes of these disasters? We do not know. Could these societies have been saved? Was it their fault? Did they persist in the fatal vice which destroyed them? What is the amount of suicide in these terrible deaths of a nation and a race? Questions to which there exists no reply. Darkness enwraps condemned civilizations. They sprung a leak, then they sank. We have nothing more to say; and it is with a sort of terror that we look on, at the bottom of that sea which is called the past, behind those colossal waves, at the shipwreck of those immense vessels, Babylon, Nineveh, Tarsus, Thebes, Rome, beneath the fearful gusts which emerge from all the mouths of the shadows. But shadows are there, and light is here. We are not acquainted with the maladies of these ancient civilizations, we do not know the infirmities of our own. Everywhere upon it we have the right of light, we contemplate its beauties, we lay bare its defects. Where it is ill, we probe; and the sickness once diagnosed, the study of the cause leads to the discovery of the remedy. Our civilization, the work of twenty centuries, is its law and its prodigy; it is worth the trouble of saving. It will be saved. It is already much to have solaced it; its enlightenment is yet another point. All the labors of modern social philosophies must converge towards this point. The thinker of to-day has a great duty-- to auscultate civilization. We repeat, that this auscultation brings encouragement; it is by this persistence in encouragement that we wish to conclude these pages, an austere interlude in a mournful drama. Beneath the social mortality, we feel human imperishableness. The globe does not perish, because it has these wounds, craters, eruptions, sulphur pits, here and there, nor because of a volcano which ejects its pus. The maladies of the people do not kill man. And yet, any one who follows the course of social clinics shakes his head at times. The strongest, the tenderest, the most logical have their hours of weakness. Will the future arrive? It seems as though we might almost put this question, when we behold so much terrible darkness. Melancholy face-to-face encounter of selfish and wretched. On the part of the selfish, the prejudices, shadows of costly education, appetite increasing through intoxication, a giddiness of prosperity which dulls, a fear of suffering which, in some, goes as far as an aversion for the suffering, an implacable satisfaction, the I so swollen that it bars the soul; on the side of the wretched covetousness, envy, hatred of seeing others enjoy, the profound impulses of the human beast towards assuaging its desires, hearts full of mist, sadness, need, fatality, impure and simple ignorance. Shall we continue to raise our eyes to heaven? Is the luminous point which we distinguish there one of those which vanish? The ideal is frightful to behold, thus lost in the depths, small,isolated, imperceptible, brilliant, but surrounded by those great, black menaces, monstrously heaped around it; yet no more in danger than a star in the maw of the clouds. 慢性侵害和突然轰击一样能使人死亡。 我们应当不厌其烦地反复提出：要最先想到那些没有生计的痛苦民众，为他们减少困难，让他们得到空气和光明，爱护他们，扩大他们的视野，使他们感到灿烂辉煌，用种种形式为他们提供接受教育的机会，为他们提供劳动的榜样，而不是游手好闲的榜样，减轻他们个人负担的压力，增加他们对总目标的认识，限制穷困而不限制财富，大量创造人民共同劳动的天地，象布里亚柔斯①那样，把一百只手从四面八方伸向受压迫和软弱无力的人，为这一伟大职责运用集体的力量，为所有的胳膊开设工厂，为所有的才能开办学校，为所有的智力设立实验室，增加工资，减轻惩罚，平衡收支，也就是说，调整福利与劳动之间和享用与需求之间的比重。总之，要使社会机器为受苦和无知的人的利益发出更多的光明和更多的温暖，使富于同情心的人不忘记这些，这是人间友爱的第一义务，使自私自利的人懂得这些，这是政治的第一需要。 ①布里亚柔斯（Briarée），神话中的巨人，是天和地的儿子，有五十个头和一百只手。　 我们还得指出，所有这些，只不过是一个开始。真正的问题是：劳动如果不成为权利，就不可能成为一种法制。 我们不在这里细谈，这里不是细谈的地方。 如果自然界是人类的依靠，人类社会便该有预见。 才智和精神的增长的必要性决不亚于物质的改善。知识是人生旅途中的资粮，思想第一重要，真理是粮食，有如稻麦。缺乏科学和哲理依据的智力必然枯竭。不吸取营养的精神和不吃不喝的胃是一样可怜的。如果还有什么比死于饥渴的躯体更能使人痛心的话，那一定是由于得不到光明而死去的灵魂了。 进步总倾向于问题的解决。总有一天，人们会大吃一惊。人类既是向高处前进的，处于底层深处的阶层必将自然而然地从灾区冲出。贫困的消灭将由水平的一次简单提高而得以完成。 人们如果怀疑这种善良的解决，那就错了。 过去的影响在目前确实还是很强大的。它会卷土重来。再次获得青春的尸体是骇人的。瞧！它大踏步地走来了。它好象是胜利者，这死尸成了征服者。它领着它的军团棗种种迷信，带着它的佩剑棗专制制度，举着它的大旗棗愚昧无知，来到了，不久前它还打了十次胜仗。它前进，它威吓，它笑，它到了我们的门口。至于我们，我们不用气馁。让我们把汉尼拔驻军的营地卖了吧。 我们有信念，我们还怕什么呢？ 思想并不比江河有更多倒退的余地。 可是不要未来的人应当多想想。他们不要进步，其实他们所否认的并不是未来，而只是他们自己。他们甘愿害暗疾，他们把过去的种种当作疫苗来给自己接种。只有一个办法可以拒绝明天，那便是死去。 因此，不要死亡，躯体的死亡越迟越好，灵魂永不要死亡，这便是我们的愿望。 是的，谜底终将被揭开，斯芬克司终将说话，问题终将得到解决。是的，人民在十八世纪已经受了启蒙教育，他们必将成熟于十九世纪。对此，只有白痴才怀疑！普遍的美好的生活，在将来，在不久的将来，一定会象鲜花那样遍地开放，这一前景是天经地义，必然会到来的。 各方无限巨大的推力一同操纵着人间的事物，在一定时期使它们一一合乎逻辑，也就是说，平衡，也就是说，到达平等。一种由天地合成的力量来自人道并统治着人类，那种力量是创造奇迹的能手，对它来说，巧妙地排除困难并不比安排剧情的非常转变更棘手些。在来自人间的科学和来自上方的机缘这两者的帮助下，它对被提出的问题里一些可能会使庸人感到无法解决的矛盾是不怎么惊讶的。它从各种思想的综合分析中找到的解决方法的能力，并不低于从各种事态的综合分析中得出的教训，从进步的这种神秘威力中人可以期望一切，有朝一日，进步将使东方和西方在坟墓的底里相对，将使伊玛目①和波拿巴在大金字塔的内部对话。 目前，在这洋洋大观的思想长征中，我们不要止步，不要游移，不要有停顿的时间。社会哲学主要是和平哲学。它的目标，它应有的效果，是从研究敌对的动机中消除愤怒。它调查，它探讨，它分析，随后，它重新组合。它通过切削的办法进行工作，它把一切方面的仇恨全都切除。 人们不止一次看到一个社会会在一阵风暴中消失，历史中有不少民族和帝国惨遭灭顶，有不少习俗、法律、宗教，在一天之内被一阵突然袭来的飓风全部摧毁。印度、迦勒底、波斯、亚述、埃及的文明都先后消失了。为什么？我们不知道。这些灾难的根源何在？我们不了解。这些社会，在当时竟是无从拯救的吗？这中间有没有它们自身的过失呢？它们是不是曾在某种必然带来不幸的罪恶方面坚持错误，以致自取灭亡呢？在一个国家和一个民族的这种可怕的绝灭中，自杀的因素应占多大比重呢？这些问题，都无从回答。覆盖在这些消逝了的文明上面的，是一片黑暗。既然它们漏水，它们就被吞没了，再没有什么可说的。我们回溯已往的若干世纪，有如注视汪洋大海中的滔天巨浪，看见一艘艘特大的船：巴比伦、尼尼微、塔尔苏斯②、底比斯、罗马，在黑风恶浪的狂冲猛袭中，一一沉入海底，不禁意夺神骇。但是，那边黑暗，这边光明。我们不懂古代文明的病害，却知道自己文明的疾患。我们处处都有权利把它拿到阳光下来照照，我们瞻仰它的美丽，也要赤裸裸地揭露它的丑恶。它哪里不对劲，我们便在哪里诊治，一旦查明病情便可研究病因，对症下药。我们的文明是二十个世纪的成果，它既奇形怪状，但也绚烂不凡，它是值得救护的。也一定能得救。救助它，那已经不坏，开导它，就更好。现代社会哲学的一切活动都应集中于这一目标。今天的思想家负有一个重大的职责，那便是对文明进行听诊。 ①伊玛目（iman），伊斯兰教清真寺的教长。 ②塔尔苏斯（Tarse，即Tarsus），土耳其城市，在阿达纳之西。　　 我们要反复指出，这种听诊是能鼓舞人心的，也正是为了加强这种鼓舞作用，我们才在一个悲惨故事中插进这几页严肃的题外话。社会可以消亡，人类却不会毁灭。地球不会因这儿那儿有了些象伤口那样的火山口，象癣疥那样的硫质喷气孔，也不会因有座象流脓血那样喷射着的火山而死去。人民的疾病杀不了人。 虽然如此，对社会进行临床诊断的人，谁也会有摇头的时候。最刚强、最柔和、最讲逻辑的人有时也会迷惘。 未来果真会来到吗？人们被眼前的黑暗吓住时，几乎会对自己提出这样的问题。自私的人和贫苦的人的会见是阴惨的。在自私的人方面，有种种成见，那种发家致富教育的毒害，越吃越馋的胃口，财迷心窍的丧心病狂，对受苦的惧怕，有些竟恶化到了对受苦人的厌恶，毫不容情地要满足自己的欲念，自负到了精神闭塞的状态；在贫苦的人方面，有羡慕心、嫉妒心、见别人快乐而起的愤恨、因追求满足而发自内心深处的兽性冲动、充满了迷雾的心、忧愁、希求、怨命、不洁而又单纯的无知。 应当继续仰望天空吗？我们见到的天边的那个光点，是不是那些在熄灭中的天体之一呢？理想，高悬在遥远的天边，是那样微小，孤独，难以觉察，闪着亮光，看去令人心寒，在它四周，还围绕着堆叠如山的险阻危难和恶风黑影，然而它并不比云边的星星更处于危险之中。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4377.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
