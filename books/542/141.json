Homuncio, Plautus would say.\\n\\n This little being is joyous. He has not food every day, and he goes to the play every evening, if he sees good. He has no shirt on his body, no shoes on his feet, no roof over his head; he is like the flies of heaven, who have none of these things. He is from seven to thirteen years of age, he lives in bands, roams the streets, lodges in the open air, wears an old pair of trousers of his father\u0027s, which descend below his heels, an old hat of some other father, which descends below his ears, a single suspender of yellow listing; he runs, lies in wait, rummages about, wastes time, blackens pipes, swears like a convict, haunts the wine-shop, knows thieves, calls gay women thou, talks slang, sings obscene songs, and has no evil in his heart. This is because he has in his heart a pearl, innocence; and pearls are not to be dissolved in mud. So long as man is in his childhood, God wills that he shall be innocent.\\n\\n If one were to ask that enormous city: \"What is this?\" she would reply: \"It is my little one.\"\\n\\n 你把这两个概念棗一个隐含整个洪炉，一个隐含全部晨曦的概念棗结合起来，你让巴黎和儿童这两粒火星相互接触，便会迸射出一个小人儿。这小人儿，普劳图斯①也许会称他小哥。 \\n\\n ①普劳图斯（Plaute，约前254?84），古罗马诗人，喜剧作家。\\n\\n 这小人儿是欢乐的。他不一定每天都有东西吃，可是，只要他高兴，他可以每天都去娱乐场所。他身上没有衬衣，脚上没有鞋，头上没有屋顶；他好象是空中的一只飞虫，那一切东西，他全没有。他的年龄在七至十三岁之间，过着群居生活，在街上游荡，在野外露宿，穿着自己父亲的一条破裤，拖着鞋后跟，顶着另一父辈的一顶破帽，压过耳朵，挎着半副黄边背带，东奔西跑，左张右望，寻寻觅觅，悠悠荡荡，把烟斗抽到发黑，满嘴粗话，坐酒铺，交小偷，逗窑姐，说黑话，唱淫歌，心里却没有一点坏念头。那是因为在他的灵魂里有颗明珠棗天真，明珠不会溶化在污泥里。人在童年，上帝总是要他天真的。假使有人问那大都市说：“那是什么？”它会回答：“那是我的孩子。”\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4278.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
