{"id":35731,"no":144,"title":"Part 3 Book 1 Chapter 4 He may be of Use","content":"Paris begins with the lounger and ends with the street Arab, two beings of which no other city is capable; the passive acceptance, which contents itself with gazing, and the inexhaustible initiative; Prudhomme and Fouillou. Paris alone has this in its natural history. The whole of the monarchy is contained in the lounger; the whole of anarchy in the gamin.\n This pale child of the Parisian faubourgs lives and develops, makes connections, \"grows supple\" in suffering, in the presence of social realities and of human things, a thoughtful witness. He thinks himself heedless; and he is not. He looks and is on the verge of laughter; he is on the verge of something else also. Whoever you may be, if your name is Prejudice, Abuse, Ignorance, Oppression, Iniquity, Despotism, Injustice, Fanaticism, Tyranny, beware of the gaping gamin.\n The little fellow will grow up.\n Of what clay is he made? Of the first mud that comes to hand. A handful of dirt, a breath, and behold Adam. It suffices for a God to pass by. A God has always passed over the street Arab. Fortune labors at this tiny being. By the word \"fortune\" we mean chance, to some extent. That pigmy kneaded out of common earth, ignorant, unlettered, giddy, vulgar, low. Will that become an Ionian or a Boeotian? Wait, currit rota, the Spirit of Paris, that demon which creates the children of chance and the men of destiny, reversing the process of the Latin potter, makes of a jug an amphora.\n 巴黎近郊的这个脸色灰白的孩子，面对着令人深省的社会现实和人间事物，活着，成长着，在苦难中沉下去，浮上来。他自以为是不用心思的，其实不然。他望着，老想笑，也老想着要干其他的事。不问你是什么，成见也好，贪渎行为也好，卑劣作风、压迫、不义、专制、不公、热狂、暴政也好，你都得留心注意那个张着嘴发愣的野孩。\n 那小不点儿会成长起来的。\n 他是什么材料做成的？任何一种污泥。一撮土，一口气，你就有了亚当。只要有神经过就够了。而在那野孩的头上总是有神经过的。幸运照顾着野孩。我们在这里所说的幸运，颇有点冒险犯难的意味。用凡尘俗土抟捏出来的这小子，无知、不文、鲁莽、粗野、平凡，他将成为奋发有为的人还是碌碌无闻的人呢？等着瞧吧，“周回陶钧”，巴黎的精神，这是个凭机会创造孩童、凭造化陶铸成人的巨灵，它不同于拉丁的陶工，它能化瓦釜为黄钟。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4281.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
