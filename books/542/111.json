{"id":35698,"no":111,"title":"Part 2 Book 5 Chapter 8 The Enigma becomes Doubly Mysterious","content":"The child had laid her head on a stone and fallen asleep. He sat down beside her and began to think. Little by little, as he gazed at her, he grew calm and regained possession of his freedom of mind. He clearly perceived this truth, the foundation of his life henceforth, that so long as she was there, so long as he had her near him, he should need nothing except for her, he should fear nothing except for her. He was not even conscious that he was very cold, since he had taken off his coat to cover her. Nevertheless, athwart this revery into which he had fallen he had heard for some time a peculiar noise. It was like the tinkling of a bell. This sound proceeded from the garden. It could be heard distinctly though faintly. It resembled the faint, vague music produced by the bells of cattle at night in the pastures. This noise made Valjean turn round. He looked and saw that there was some one in the garden. A being resembling a man was walking amid the bell-glasses of the melon beds, rising, stooping, halting, with regular movements, as though he were dragging or spreading out something on the ground. This person appeared to limp. Jean Valjean shuddered with the continual tremor of the unhappy. For them everything is hostile and suspicious. They distrust the day because it enables people to see them, and the night because it aids in surprising them. A little while before he had shivered because the garden was deserted, and now he shivered because there was some one there. He fell back from chimerical terrors to real terrors. He said to himself that Javert and the spies had, perhaps, not taken their departure; that they had, no doubt, left people on the watch in the street; that if this man should discover him in the garden, he would cry out for help against thieves and deliver him up. He took the sleeping Cosette gently in his arms and carried her behind a heap of old furniture, which was out of use, in the most remote corner of the shed. Cosette did not stir. From that point he scrutinized the appearance of the being in the melon patch. The strange thing about it was, that the sound of the bell followed each of this man\u0027s movements. When the man approached, the sound approached; when the man retreated, the sound retreated; if he made any hasty gesture, a tremolo accompanied the gesture; when he halted, the sound ceased. It appeared evident that the bell was attached to that man; but what could that signify? Who was this man who had a bell suspended about him like a ram or an ox? As he put these questions to himself, he touched Cosette\u0027s hands. They were icy cold. \"Ah! good God!\" he cried. He spoke to her in a low voice:-- \"Cosette!\" She did not open her eyes. He shook her vigorously. She did not wake. \"Is she dead?\" he said to himself, and sprang to his feet, quivering from head to foot. The most frightful thoughts rushed pell-mell through his mind. There are moments when hideous surmises assail us like a cohort of furies, and violently force the partitions of our brains. When those we love are in question, our prudence invents every sort of madness. He remembered that sleep in the open air on a cold night may be fatal. Cosette was pale, and had fallen at full length on the ground at his feet, without a movement. He listened to her breathing: she still breathed, but with a respiration which seemed to him weak and on the point of extinction. How was he to warm her back to life? How was he to rouse her? All that was not connected with this vanished from his thoughts. He rushed wildly from the ruin. It was absolutely necessary that Cosette should be in bed and beside a fire in less than a quarter of an hour. 他坐在她身边，望着她睡。望着望着，他的心渐渐安定下来了，思想也渐渐可以自由活动了。 他清醒地认识到这样一点真理，也就是今后他活着的意义，他认识到，只要她在，只要他能把她留在身边，除了为了她，他什么也不需要，除了为她着想，他什么也不害怕。他已脱下自己的大衣裹在珂赛特的身上，他自己身上很冷，可是连这一点他也没有感觉到。 这时，在梦幻中，他不止一次听见一种奇怪的声音。好象是个受到振动的铃铛。那声音来自园里。声音虽弱，却很清楚。有些象夜间在牧场上听到的那种从牲口颈脖上的铃铛所发出的微渺的乐音。 那声音使冉阿让回过头去。 他朝前望，看见园里有个人。 那人好象是个男子，他在瓜田里的玻璃罩子中间走来走去，走走停停，时而弯下腰去，继又立起再走，仿佛他在田里拖着或撒播着什么似的。那人走起路来好象腿有些瘸。 冉阿让见了为之一惊，心绪不宁的人是不断会起恐慌的。他们感到对于自己事事都是敌对的，可疑的。他们提防白天，因为白天可以帮助别人看见自己，也提防黑夜，因为黑夜可以帮助别人发觉自己。他先头为了园里荒凉而惊慌，现在又为了园里有人而惊慌。 他又从空想的恐怖掉进了现实的恐怖。他想道，沙威和密探们也许还没有离开，他们一定留下了一部分人在街上守望，这人如果发现了他在园里，一定会大叫捉贼，把他交出去。他把睡着的珂赛特轻轻抱在怀里，抱到破棚最靠里的一个角落里，放在一堆无用的废家具后面。珂赛特一点也不动。 从这里，他再仔细观察瓜田里那个人的行动。有一件事很奇怪，铃铛的响声是随着那人的行动而起的。人走近，声音也近，人走远，声音也远。他做一个急促的动作，铃子也跟着发出一连串急促的声音，他停着不动，铃声也随即停止。很明显，铃铛是结在那人身上的，不过这是什么意思？和牛羊一样结个铃子在身上，那究竟是个什么人？ 他一面东猜西想，一面伸出手摸珂赛特的手。她的手冰冷。 “啊，我的天主！”他说。 他低声喊道： “珂赛特！” 她不睁眼睛。 他使劲推她。 她也不醒。 “难道死了不成！”他说，随即立了起来，从头一直抖到脚。 他头脑里出现了一阵乱糟糟的无比恐怖的想法。有时，我们是会感到种种骇人的假想象一群魔怪似的，齐向我们袭来，而且猛烈地震撼着我们的神经。当我们心爱的人出了事，我们的谨慎心往往会无端地产生许多狂悖的幻想。他忽然想到冬夜户外睡眠可以送人的命。 珂赛特，脸色发青，在他脚前躺在地上，一动也不动。 他听她的呼吸，她还吐着气，但是他觉得她的气息已经弱到快要停止了。 怎样使她暖过来呢？怎样使她醒过来呢？除了这两件事以外，他什么也不顾了。他发狂似的冲出了破屋子。 一定得在一刻钟里让珂赛特躺在火前和床上。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4248.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
