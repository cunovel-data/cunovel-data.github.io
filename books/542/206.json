It might have been half-past five o\u0027clock. Only half an hour separated him from what was about to happen. He heard the beating of his arteries as one hears the ticking of a watch in the dark. He thought of the double march which was going on at that moment in the dark,--crime advancing on one side, justice coming up on the other. He was not afraid, but he could not think without a shudder of what was about to take place. As is the case with all those who are suddenly assailed by an unforeseen adventure, the entire day produced upon him the effect of a dream, and in order to persuade himqelt; The father exclaimed:-- \"Go in, nevertheless.\" The door opened, and Marius saw the tall Jondrette come in with a candle in her hand. She was as she had been in the morning,only still more repulsive in this light. She walked straight up to the bed. Marius endured an indescribable moment of anxiety; but near the bed there was a mirror nailed to the wall, and it was thither that she was directing her steps. She raised herself on tiptoe and looked at herself in it. In the neighboring room, the sound of iron articles being moved was audible. She smoothed her hair with the palm of her hand, and smiled into the mirror, humming with her cracked and sepulchral voice:-- Nos amours ont dure toute une semaine,[28] Mais que du bonheur les instants sont courts!S\u0027ad}QЩ?pushed them under his bed. Several minutes elapsed. Marius heard the lower door turn on its hinges; a heavy step mounted the staircase, and hastened along the corridor; the latch of the hovel was noisily lifted; it was Jondrette returning.　 Instantly, several voices arose. The whole family was in the garret. Only, it had been silent in the master\u0027s absence, like wolf whelps in the absence of the wolf. \"It\u0027s I,\" said he. \"Good evening, daddy,\" yelped the girls. \"Well?\" said the mother. \"All\u0027s going first-rate,\" responded Jondrette, \"but my feet are beastly cold. Good! You have dressed up. You have done well! You must inspire confidence.\" \"All ready to go out.\" \"Don\u0027t forget what I told you. You will do everything sure?\" \"Rest easy.\" \"Because--\" said Jondrette. And he left the phrase unfinished. Marius heard him lay something heavy on the table, probably the chisel which he had purchased. \"By the way,\" said Jondrette, \"have you been eating here?\" \"Yes,\" said the mother. \"I got three large potatoes and some salt. I took advantage of the fire to cook them.\"　 \"Good,\" returned Jondrette. \"To-morrow I will take you out to dine with me. We will have a duck and fixings. You shall dine like Charles the Tenth; all is going well!\" Then he added:-- \"The mouse-trap is open. The cats are there.\" He lowered his voice still further, and said:-- \"Put this in the fire.\" Marius heard a sound of charcoal being knocked with the tongs or some iron utensil, and Jondrette continued:--　 \"Have you greased the hinges of the door so that they will not squeak?\" \"Yes,\" replied the mother. \"What time is it?\" \"Nearly six. The half-hour struck from Saint-Medard a while ago.\" \"The devil!\" ejaculated Jondrette; \"the children must go and watch. Come you, do you listen here.\"　 A whispering ensued. Jondrette\u0027s voice became audible again:-- \"Has old Bougon left?\" \"Yes,\" said the mother. \"Are you sure that there is no one in our neighbor\u0027s room?\" \"He has not been in all day, and you know very well that this is his dinner hour.\" \"You are sure?\" \"Sure.\"　 \"All the same,\" said Jondrette, \"there\u0027s no harm in going to see whether he is there. Here, my girl, take the candle and go there.\"　 Marius fell on his hands and knees and crawled silently under his bed.　 Hardly had he concealed himself, when he perceived a light through the crack of his door. \"P\u0027pa,\" cried a voice, \"he is not in here.\" He recognized the voice of the eldest daughter. \"Did you go in?\" demanded her father. \"No,\" replied the girl, \"but as his key is in the door, he must be out.\" The father exclaimed:-- \"Go in, nevertheless.\" The door opened, and Marius saw the tall Jondrette come in with a candle in her hand. She was as she had been in the morning,only still more repulsive in this light. She walked straight up to the bed. Marius endured an indescribable moment of anxiety; but near the bed there was a mirror nailed to the wall, and it was thither that she was directing her steps. She raised herself on tiptoe and looked at herself in it. In the neighboring room, the sound of iron articles being moved was audible. She smoothed her hair with the palm of her hand, and smiled into the mirror, humming with her cracked and sepulchral voice:-- Nos amours ont dure toute une semaine,[28] Mais que du bonheur les instants sont courts!S\u0027adorer huit jours, c\u0027 etait bien la peine!Le temps des amours devait durer toujours!Devrait durer toujours! devrait durer toujours!　 [28] Our love has lasted a whole week, but how short are the instants of happiness! To adore each other for eight days was hardly worth the while! The time of love should last forever. In the meantime, Marius trembled. It seemed impossible to him that she should not hear his breathing. She stepped to the window and looked out with the half-foolish way she had. \"How ugly Paris is when it has put on a white chemise!\" said she. She returned to the mirror and began again to put on airs before it,scrutinizing herself full-face and three-quarters face in turn.　 \"Well!\" cried her father, \"what are you about there?\" \"I am looking under the bed and the furniture,\" she replied,continuing to arrange her hair; \"there\u0027s no one here.\" \"Booby!\" yelled her father. \"Come here this minute! And don\u0027t waste any time about it!\" \"Coming! Coming!\" said she. \"One has no time for anything in this hovel!\" She hummed:-- Vous me quittez pour aller a la gloire;[29] Mon triste coeur suivra partout.　 [29] You leave me to go to glory; my sad heart will follow you everywhere. She cast a parting glance in the mirror and went out, shutting the door behind her. A moment more, and Marius heard the sound of the two young girls\u0027 bare feet in the corridor, and Jondrette\u0027s voice shouting to them:-- \"Pay strict heed! One on the side of the barrier, the other at the corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier. Don\u0027t lose sight for a moment of the door of this house, and the moment you see anything, rush here on the instant! as hard as you can go! You have a key to get in.\" The eldest girl grumbled:-- \"The idea of standing watch in the snow barefoot!\" \"To-morrow you shall have some dainty little green silk boots!\" said the father. They ran down stairs, and a few seconds later the shock of the outer door as it banged to announced that they were outside. There now remained in the house only Marius, the Jondrettes and probably, also, the mysterious persons of whom Marius had caught a glimpse in the twilight, behind the door of the unused attic. 雪已经不下了，月亮穿透浓雾，逐渐明朗，它的清光和积雪的白色反光交相辉映，给那屋子一种平明时分的景色。 容德雷特的穷窟里却有着光。马吕斯望见阵阵红光从墙上的窟窿里象鲜血似的射出来。 从实际观察，那样的光是不大可能由一支蜡烛发出的。况且，在容德雷特家里，没有一个人活动，没有一个人说话，声息全无，那里的寂静是冰冷和深沉的，要是没有这一点火光，马吕斯会以为他是在坟墓的隔壁。 他轻轻地脱下靴子，把它们推到床底下。 几分钟过后，马吕斯听到下面的门在门斗里转动的声音，一阵沉重急促的脚步上了楼梯，穿过过道，隔壁门上的铁闩一声响，门就开了，容德雷特回来了。 立即有好几个人说话的声音。原来全家的人都在那破窝里，不过家长不在时谁也不吭气，正如老狼不在时的小狼群。 “是我。”他说。 “你好，好爸爸！”两个姑娘尖声叫起来。 “怎么说？”那母亲问。 “一切溜溜顺”容德雷特回答，“只是我的脚冷得象冻狗肉一样。好。对的，你换了衣服。你得取得人家的信任，这是完全必要的。” “我全准备好了，要走就走。” “你没有忘记我教你的话吧？你全能做到？” “你放心。” “可是……”容德雷特说。他没有说完那句话。 马吕斯听见他把一件重东西放在桌上，也许是他买的那把钝口凿。 “啊，你们吃了东西没有？” “吃了，”那母亲说，“我吃了三个大土豆，加了点盐。我利用这炉火烘熟的。” “好，”容德雷特说。“明天我领你们一道去吃一顿。有全鸭，还有配菜。你们可以吃得象查理十世那样好。一切顺利！” 继又放低声音加上一句： “老鼠笼已经打开了。猫儿也全到了。” 他把声音压得更低，说道： “把这放在火里。” 马吕斯听到一阵火钳或其他铁器和煤块相撞的声音。容德雷特又说： “你在门斗里涂上了油吧？不能让它出声音。” “涂过了。”那母亲回答。 “什么时候了？” “快六点了。圣美达刚敲过半点。” “见鬼！”容德雷特说。“小的应当去望风了。来，你们两个，听我说。” 接着是一阵喁喁私语的声音。 容德雷特又提高嗓子说： “毕尔贡妈走了吗？” “走了。”那母亲说。 “你担保隔壁屋子里没有人吗？” “他一整天没回来，你也知道现在是他吃晚饭的时候。” “你拿得稳？” “拿得稳。” “没关系！”容德雷特又说，“到他屋子里去看看他是不是在家，总没有坏处。大姑娘，带支蜡烛去瞧瞧。” 马吕斯连忙两手两膝一齐着地，悄悄地爬到床底下去了。 他在床下还没有蜷伏好，便看见从门缝里射来的光。 “爸，”一个人的声音喊着说，“他出去了。” 他听出是那大姑娘的声音。 “你进去看了没有？”她父亲问。 “没有，”姑娘回答，“他的钥匙在门上，那他一定是出去了。” 她父亲喊道： “还是要进去看看。” 房门开了，马吕斯看见容德雷特大姑娘走进来，手里拿着一支蜡烛。她还是早上那模样，不过在烛光中显得更加可怕。 她直向床边走来，马吕斯一时慌到无可名状，但是在床边墙上，挂了一面镜子，她要去的是这地方。她踮起脚尖，对着镜子顾影自盼。隔壁屋子里传来一阵翻动废铁的声音。 她用手掌抹平自己的头发，一面对着镜子装笑脸，一面用她那破裂阴惨的嗓子轻轻地哼着： 我们的恩爱整整延续了八天， 但是幸福的时刻短得可怜！ 相亲相爱八昼夜，快乐无边！ 爱的时间，应当永远延绵！ 应当永远延绵！应当永远延绵！ 可是马吕斯抖得厉害。他感到她不可能不听到他呼吸的声音。 她走到窗口，望着外面，用她所特有的半疯癫的神态大声说话。 “巴黎是真丑，当它穿上白衬衫的时候！”她说。 她又走到镜子跟前，再作种种怪脸，时而正面，时而四分之三的侧面，把自己欣赏个不停。 “怎么了！”她父亲喊，“你在那里干什么？” “我在看床底下，看家具底下，”她一面理自己的头发，一面回答，“一个人也没有。” “傻丫头！”她父亲吼了起来，“赶快回来！不要白费时间。”“我就来！我就来！”她说，“在他们这破窑里，老是急急忙忙，啥也干不成。” 她又哼着： 你撇下了我去追求荣誉， 我这碎了的心，将随时随地与你同行。 她对着镜子望了最后一眼，才走出去，随手关上了门。 过一会儿，马吕斯听到两个姑娘赤脚在过道里走路的声音，又听到容德雷特对她们喊： “要好好留心！一个在便门这边，一个在小银行家街的角上。眼睛一下也不要离开这房子的大门。要是看见一点点什么，便赶快回来！四步当一步跑！你们带一把进大门的钥匙。” 大姑娘嘴里嘟囔着： “大雪天还得光着脚板去放哨！” “明天你们就有闪缎靴子穿！”那父亲说。 她们下了楼梯，几秒钟过后，下面的门呯的一声关上了，这说明她们已到了外面。 现在，房子里只剩下马吕斯和容德雷特两口子了，也许还有马吕斯在昏暗中隐隐望见过的、待在一间空屋子门背后的那几个神秘人物。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4343.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
