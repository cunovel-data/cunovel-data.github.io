{"id":35665,"no":78,"title":"Part 2 Book 1 Chapter 11 A Bad Guide to Napoleon","content":"The painful surprise of Napoleon is well known. Grouchy hoped for, Blucher arriving. Death instead of life.\\n\\n Fate has these turns; the throne of the world was expected; it was Saint Helena that was seen.\\n\\n If the little shepherd who served as guide to Bulow, Blucher\u0027s lieutenant, had advised him to debouch from the forest above Frischemont, instead of below Plancenoit, the form of the nineteenth century might, perhaps, have been different. Napoleon would have won the battle of Waterloo. By any other route than that below Plancenoit, the Prussian army would have come out upon a ravine impassable for artillery, and Bulow would not have arrived.\\n\\n Now the Prussian general, Muffling, declares that one hour\u0027s delay, and Blucher would not have found Wellington on his feet. \"The battle was lost.\"\\n\\n It was time that Bulow should arrive, as will be seen. He had, moreover, been very much delayed. He had bivouacked at Dion-le-Mont, and had set out at daybreak; but the roads were impassable, and his divisions stuck fast in the mire. The ruts were up to the hubs of the cannons. Moreover, he had been obliged to pass the Dyle on the narrow bridge of Wavre; the street leading to the bridge had been fired by the French, so the caissons and ammunition-wagons could not pass between two rows of burning houses, and had been obliged to wait until the conflagration was extinguished. It was mid-day before Bulow\u0027s vanguard had been able to reach Chapelle-Saint-Lambert.\\n\\n Had the action been begun two hours earlier, it would have been over at four o\u0027clock, and Blucher would have fallen on the battle won by Napoleon. Such are these immense risks proportioned to an infinite which we cannot comprehend.\\n\\n The Emperor had been the first, as early as mid-day, to descry with his field-glass, on the extreme horizon, something which had attracted his attention. He had said, \"I see yonder a cloud, which seems to me to be troops.\" Then he asked the Duc de Dalmatie, \"Soult, what do you see in the direction of Chapelle-Saint-Lambert?\" The marshal, levelling his glass, answered, \"Four or five thousand men, Sire; evidently Grouchy.\" But it remained motionless in the mist. All the glasses of the staff had studied \"the cloud\" pointed out by the Emperor. Some said: \"It is trees.\" The truth is, that the cloud did not move. The Emperor detached Domon\u0027s division of light cavalry to reconnoitre in that quarter.\\n\\n Bulow had not moved, in fact. His vanguard was very feeble, and could accomplish nothing. He was obliged to wait for the body of the army corps, and he had received orders to concentrate his forces before entering into line; but at five o\u0027clock, perceiving Wellington\u0027s peril, Blucher ordered Bulow to attack, and uttered these remarkable words: \"We must give air to the English army.\"\\n\\n A little later, the divisions of Losthin, Hiller, Hacke, and Ryssel deployed before Lobau\u0027s corps, the cavalry of Prince William of Prussia debouched from the forest of Paris, Plancenoit was in flames, and the Prussian cannon-balls began to rain even upon the ranks of the guard in reserve behind Napoleon.\\n\\n 命运竟有如此的变幻，他正待坐上世界的宝座，却望见了圣赫勒拿①岛显现在眼前。 \\n\\n ①圣赫勒拿（SainteCHélène），岛名。拿破仑在滑铁卢战败后，被囚于该岛。　\\n\\n 假使替布吕歇尔的副司令比洛当向导的那个牧童教他从弗里谢蒙的上面走出森林，而不从普朗尚努瓦的下面，十九世纪的面貌也许就会不同些。滑铁卢战争的胜利也许属于拿破仑了。除了普朗尚努瓦下面的那条路，普鲁士军队都会遇到不容炮队通过的裂谷，比洛也就到达不了。\\n\\n 所以，再迟到一个钟头，据普鲁士将军米夫林说，布吕歇尔就不会看见威灵顿站着；“战事已经失败了。”足见比洛到的正是时候。况且他已耽误了不少时间。他在狄翁山露宿了一夜，天一亮又开动。但是那些道路都难走，他的部队全泥淖满身。轮辙深达炮轮的轴。此外，他还得由那条狭窄的瓦弗桥渡过迪尔河，通桥的那条街道已被法军放火烧起来了，两旁房屋的火势正炽，炮队的弹药车和辎重车不能冒火穿过，非得等火熄灭不能走。到了中午，比洛的前锋还没有到圣朗贝堂。\\n\\n 假使战事早两个钟头开始，到四点便可以完毕，布吕歇尔赶来，也会是在拿破仑得胜之后。那种渺茫的机缘不是人力所能测度的。\\n\\n 在中午皇上首先就从望远镜中望见极远处有点什么东西，这使他放心不下。他说：“我看见那边有堆黑影，象是军队。”接着，他问达尔马提亚公爵说：“苏尔特，您看圣朗贝堂那边是什么东西？”那位大元帅对准他的望远镜答道：“四五千人，陛下。自然是格鲁希了。”但是他们停在雾中不动。作战指挥部的人员全拿起了望远镜来研究皇上发现的那堆“黑影”。有几个说：“是些中途休息的队伍。”大部分人说：“那是些树。”可靠的是那堆黑影停着不动。皇上派了多芒的轻骑兵师去探察那黑点。\\n\\n 比洛的确不曾移动，他的前锋太弱了，无能为力。他得等候大军，并且他还得到命令，在集中兵力之前，不得擅入战线。但是到了五点钟，布吕歇尔看见威灵顿形势危急，便命令比洛进攻，并且说了这样一句漂亮话：\\n\\n “得给点空气给英国军队了。”\\n\\n 不到一刻工夫，罗襄、希勒尔、哈克和李赛尔各部在罗博的前面展开了阵式，普鲁士威廉亲王的骑兵也从巴黎森林中冲出来，普朗尚努瓦着了火，普鲁士的炮弹雨一般地射来，直达留守在拿破仑背后羽林军的行阵中。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4215.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
