{"id":35878,"no":291,"title":"Part 5 Book 1 Chapter 11 The Shot Which Misses Nothing and Kills No One","content":"The assailants\u0027 fire continued. Musketry and grape-shot alternated,but without committing great ravages, to tell the truth. The top alone of the Corinthe facade suffered; the window on the first floor, and the attic window in the roof, riddled with buck-shot and biscaiens, were slowly losing their shape. The combatants who had been posted there had been obliged to withdraw. However, this is according to the tactics of barricades; to fire for a long while, in order to exhaust the insurgents\u0027 ammunition, if they commit the mistake of replying. When it is perceived, from the slackening of their fire, that they have no more powder and ball, the assault is made. Enjolras had not fallen into this trap; the barricade did not reply.\n At every discharge by platoons, Gavroche puffed out his cheek with his tongue, a sign of supreme disdain. \n \"Good for you,\" said he, \"rip up the cloth. We want some lint.\"\n Courfeyrac called the grape-shot to order for the little effect which it produced, and said to the cannon:\n \"You are growing diffuse, my good fellow.\"\n One gets puzzled in battle, as at a ball. It is probable that this silence on the part of the redoubt began to render the besiegers uneasy, and to make them fear some unexpected incident, and that they felt the necessity of getting a clear view behind that heap of paving-stones, and of knowing what was going on behind that impassable wall which received blows without retorting. The insurgents suddenly perceived a helmet glittering in the sun on a neighboring roof. A fireman had placed his back against a tall chimney, and seemed to be acting as sentinel. His glance fell directly down into the barricade.\n \"There\u0027s an embarrassing watcher,\" said Enjolras.\n Jean Valjean had returned Enjolras\u0027 rifle, but he had his own gun.\n Without saying a word, he took aim at the fireman, and, a second later, the helmet, smashed by a bullet, rattled noisily into the street. The terrified soldier made haste to disappear. A second observer took his place. This one was an officer. Jean Valjean, who had re-loaded his gun, took aim at the newcomer and sent the officer\u0027s casque to join the soldier\u0027s. The officer did not persist, and retired speedily. This time the warning was understood. No one made his appearance thereafter on that roof; and the idea of spying on the barricade was abandoned.\n \"Why did you not kill the man?\" Bossuet asked Jean Valjean.\n Jean Valjean made no reply.\n 分队每发一次排枪，伽弗洛什就用舌头鼓起他的腮帮子，表示极大的蔑视。\n “好吧，”他说，“把床垫撕烂。我们需要绷带呀。”\n 古费拉克斥责霰弹不中用，他对大炮说：\n “伙计，你太不集中了。”\n 在作战时，好象在舞会上一样，人们互施诡计。大概这棱堡的沉默开始使进攻的一方担心了，生怕发生意外，他们感到需要摸清这堆石块后面的情况，并了解这堵漠不关心、只挨打不还击的墙内究竟在干什么。起义者们突然发觉邻近的屋顶上有一顶消防队的钢盔在阳光中闪烁。一个消防队员靠在高烟囱旁好象在那儿站岗。他的视线正好直直地落到街垒里。\n “那是一个碍事的监视。”安灼拉说。\n 冉阿让已经把卡宾枪还给了安灼拉，但他还有自己的枪。\n 他一声不响，瞄准那消防队员，一秒钟后，钢盔被一颗子弹打中，很响亮地落在街心。受惊的士兵赶快逃开了。\n 另一个监视人接替了他的岗位。这是一个军官。冉阿让又装好子弹，瞄准新来的人，把军官的钢盔打下去找士兵的钢盔作伴去了。军官不再坚持，很快也退了下去。他们明白了这个警告。从此没有人再出现在屋顶上，他们放弃了对街垒的侦察。\n “您为什么不打死那个人？”博须埃问冉阿让。\n 冉阿让没有答复。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4428.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
