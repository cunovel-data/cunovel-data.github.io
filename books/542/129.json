{"id":35716,"no":129,"title":"Part 2 Book 7 Chapter 5 Prayer","content":"They pray. To whom? To God. To pray to God,--what is the meaning of these words? Is there an infinite beyond us? Is that infinite there, inherent, permanent; necessarily substantial, since it is infinite; and because, if it lacked matter it would be bounded; necessarily intelligent, since it is infinite, and because, if it lacked intelligence, it would end there? Does this infinite awaken in us the idea of essence, while we can attribute to ourselves only the idea of existence? In other terms, is it not the absolute, of which we are only the relative? At the same time that there is an infinite without us, is there not an infinite within us? Are not these two infinites (what an alarming plural!) superposed, the one upon the other? Is not this second infinite, so to speak, subjacent to the first? Is it not the latter\u0027s mirror, reflection, echo, an abyss which is concentric with another abyss? Is this second infinity intelligent also? Does it think? Does it love? Does it will? If these two infinities are intelligent, each of them has a will principle, and there is an _I_ in the upper infinity as there is an _I_ in the lower infinity. The _I_ below is the soul; the _I_ on high is God. To place the infinity here below in contact, by the medium of thought, with the infinity on high, is called praying. Let us take nothing from the human mind; to suppress is bad. We must reform and transform. Certain faculties in man are directed towards the Unknown; thought, revery, prayer. The Unknown is an ocean. What is conscience? It is the compass of the Unknown. Thought, revery, prayer,--these are great and mysterious radiations. Let us respect them. Whither go these majestic irradiations of the soul? Into the shadow; that is to say, to the light. The grandeur of democracy is to disown nothing and to deny nothing of humanity. Close to the right of the man, beside it, at the least, there exists the right of the soul. To crush fanaticism and to venerate the infinite, such is the law. Let us not confine ourselves to prostrating ourselves before the tree of creation, and to the contemplation of its branches full of stars. We have a duty to labor over the human soul, to defend the mystery against the miracle, to adore the incomprehensible and reject the absurd, to admit, as an inexplicable fact, only what is necessary, to purify belief, to remove superstitions from above religion; to clear God of caterpillars. 向谁？ 上帝。 向上帝祈祷，这话怎么理解？ 在我们的身外，不是有个无极吗？那个无极是不是统一的，自在的，永恒的呢？它既是无极，是否必然是物质的，并以物质告罄的地方为其止境呢？它既是无极，是否必然有理智，并以理智穷尽的地方为其终点呢？那个无极是不是在我们心中唤起本体的概念，而我们只能赋予自己以存在的概念呢？换言之，难道它不是绝对而我们是它的相对吗？ 在我们的身外既然有个无极，是否在我们的心中也同时有个无极呢？这两个无极（这复数好不吓人！）是不是重叠着的呢？第二个无极是不是第一个的里层呢？它是不是另一个太虚的翻版、反映、回声，有同一中心的太虚呢？这第二个无极是不是也有智力呢？它能想吗？它有愿望吗？假如那两个无极都有智力，那么，每个都会有一种能产生愿望的本原，而且，正如在下面的这个无极里有我一样，在上面的那个无极里也会有个我。下面的这个我就是灵魂，上面的那个我就是上帝。 让下面的这个无极通过思想和上面的那个无极发生接触，那便是祈祷。 不要从人的意识中除去任何东西，抹杀是件坏事，应当改革和转变。人的某些官能是指向未知世界的，那是思想、梦想和祈祷。未知世界浩瀚无垠。良知是什么？是未知世界的指针。思想、梦想、祈祷是神秘之光的大辐射。我们应当加以尊敬。灵魂的那种庄严光辉放射到什么地方去呢？到黑暗中去，这也就是说，到光明中去。 民主的伟大便是什么也不否认，对人类什么也不放弃。紧靠人的权利，至少在它近旁，还有感情之权。 压制热狂，崇敬无极，这才是正道。仅仅拜倒在造物主的功果下面，景仰八方围拱的群星是不够的。我们有责任，要为人类的灵魂工作，保护玄义，反对奇迹，崇拜未知，唾弃邪说，在不可理解的事物前只接受必然的，使信仰健康起来，除去宗教方面的迷信，剪除上帝左右的群丑。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4266.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
