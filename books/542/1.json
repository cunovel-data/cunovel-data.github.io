{"id":35588,"no":1,"title":"Part 1 Book 1 Chapter 1 M. Myriel","content":"In 1815, M. Charles-Francois-Bienvenu Myriel was Bishop of D--He was an old man of about seventy-five years of age; he had occupied the see of D---- since 1806.\\n\\n Although this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance of what we are about to relate, it will not be superfluous, if merely for the sake of exactness in all points, to mention here the various rumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the very moment when he arrived in the diocese. True or false, that which is said of men often occupies as important a place in their lives, and above all in their destinies, as that which they do. M. Myriel was the son of a councillor of the Parliament of Aix; hence he belonged to the nobility of the bar. It was said that his father, destining him to be the heir of his own post, had married him at a very early age, eighteen or twenty, in accordance with a custom which is rather widely prevalent in parliamentary families. In spite of this marriage, however, it was said that Charles Myriel created a great deal of talk. He was well formed, though rather short in stature, elegant, graceful, intelligent; the whole of the first portion of his life had been devoted to the world and to gallantry.\\n\\n The Revolution came; events succeeded each other with precipitation; the parliamentary families, decimated, pursued, hunted down, were dispersed. M. Charles Myriel emigrated to Italy at the very beginning of the Revolution. There his wife died of a malady of the chest, from which she had long suffered. He had no children. What took place next in the fate of M. Myriel? The ruin of the French society of the olden days, the fall of his own family, the tragic spectacles of \u002793, which were, perhaps, even more alarming to the emigrants who viewed them from a distance, with the magnifying powers of terror,--did these cause the ideas of renunciation and solitude to germinate in him? Was he, in the midst of these distractions, these affections which absorbed his life, suddenly smitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which sometimes overwhelm, by striking to his heart, a man whom public catastrophes would not shake, by striking at his existence and his fortune? No one could have told: all that was known was, that when he returned from Italy he was a priest.\\n\\n In 1804, M. Myriel was the Cure of B-- [Brignolles]. He was already advanced in years, and lived in a very retired manner.\\n\\n About the epoch of the coronation, some petty affair connected with his curacy--just what, is not precisely known--took him to Paris. Among other powerful persons to whom he went to solicit aid for his parishioners was M. le Cardinal Fesch.One day, when the Emperor had come to visit his uncle, the worthy Cure, who was waiting in the anteroom, found himself present when His Majesty passed. Napoleon, on finding himself observed with a certain curiosity by this old man, turned round and said abruptly:--\\n\\n \"Who is this good man who is staring at me?\"\\n\\n \"Sire,\" said M. Myriel, \"you are looking at a good man, and I at a great man. Each of us can profit by it.\"\\n\\n That very evening, the Emperor asked the Cardinal the name of the Cure, and some time afterwards M. Myriel was utterly astonished to learn that he had been appointed Bishop of D----\\n\\n What truth was there, after all, in the stories which were invented as to the early portion of M. Myriel\u0027s life? No one knew.\\n\\n Very few families had been acquainted with the Myriel family before the Revolution.\\n\\n M. Myriel had to undergo the fate of every newcomer in a little town, where there are many mouths which talk, and very few heads which think.\\n\\n He was obliged to undergo it although he was a bishop, and because he was a bishop. But after all, the rumors with which his name was connected were rumors only,--noise, sayings, words; less than words-- palabres, as the energetic language of the South expresses it.\\n\\n However that may be, after nine years of episcopal power and of residence in D----, all the stories and subjects of conversation which engross petty towns and petty people at the outset had fallen into profound oblivion. No one would have dared to mention them; no one would have dared to recall them.\\n\\n M. Myriel had arrived at D---- accompanied by an elderly spinster, Mademoiselle Baptistine, who was his sister, and ten years his junior.\\n\\n Their only domestic was a female servant of the same age as Mademoiselle Baptistine, and named Madame Magloire, who, after having been the servant of M. le Cure, now assumed the double title of maid to Mademoiselle and housekeeper to Monseigneur.\\n\\n Mademoiselle Baptistine was a long, pale, thin, gentle creature; she realized the ideal expressed by the word \"respectable\"; for it seems that a woman must needs be a mother in order to be venerable.She had never been pretty; her whole life, which had been nothing but a succession of holy deeds, had finally conferred upon her a sort of pallor and transparency; and as she advanced in years she had acquired what may be called the beauty of goodness. What had been leanness in her youth had become transparency in her maturity; and this diaphaneity allowed the angel to be seen.\\n\\n She was a soul rather than a virgin. Her person seemed made of a shadow; there was hardly sufficient body to provide for sex; a little matter enclosing a light; large eyes forever drooping;-- a mere pretext for a soul\u0027s remaining on the earth.\\n\\n Madame Magloire was a little, fat, white old woman, corpulent and bustling; always out of breath,--in the first place, because of her activity, and in the next, because of her asthma.\\n\\n On his arrival, M. Myriel was installed in the episcopal palace with the honors required by the Imperial decrees, which class a bishop immediately after a major-general. The mayor and the president paid the first call on him, and he, in turn, paid the first call on the general and the prefect.\\n\\n The installation over, the town waited to see its bishop at work.\\n\\n 虽然这些小事绝不触及我们将要叙述的故事的本题，但为了全面精确起见，在此地提一提在他就任之初，人们所传播的有关他的一些风闻与传说也并不是无用的。大众关于某些人的传说，无论是真是假，在他们的生活中，尤其是在他们的命运中所占的地位，往往和他们亲身所作的事是同等重要的。米里哀先生是艾克斯法院的一个参议的儿子，所谓的司法界的贵族。据说他的父亲因为要他继承②那职位，很早，十八岁或二十岁，就按照司法界贵族家庭间相当普遍的习惯，为他完了婚。米里哀先生虽已结婚，据说仍常常惹起别人的谈论。他品貌不凡，虽然身材颇小，但是生得俊秀，风度翩翩，谈吐隽逸；他一生的最初阶段完全消磨在交际场所和与妇女们的厮混中。革命③爆发了，事变叠出，司法界贵族家庭因受到摧毁，驱逐，追捕而东奔西散了。米里哀先生，当革命刚开始时便出亡到意大利。他的妻，因早已害肺病，死了。他们一个孩子也没有。此后，他的一生有些什么遭遇呢？法国旧社会的崩溃，他自己家庭的破落，一般流亡者可能因远道传闻和恐怖的夸大而显得更加可怕的九三年①的种种悲剧，是否使他在思想上产生过消沉和孤独的意念呢？一个人在生活上或财产上遭了大难还可能不为所动，但有时有一种神秘可怕的打击，打在人的心上，却能使人一蹶不振；一向在欢乐和温情中度日的他，是否受过那种突如其来的打击呢？没有谁那样说，我们所知道的只是：他从意大利回来，就已经当了教士了。\\n\\n ①迪涅（Digne）在法国南部，是下阿尔卑斯省的省会。\\n\\n ②当时法院的官职是可以买的，并可传给儿孙。\\n\\n ③指一七八九年法国资产阶级革命。\\n\\n ①一七九三年是革命达到高潮的一年。\\n\\n 一八○四年，米里哀先生是白里尼奥尔的本堂神甫。他当时已经老了，过着深居简出的生活。\\n\\n 接近加冕②时，他为了本区的一件不知道什么小事，到巴黎去过一趟。他代表他教区的信众们向上级有所陈请，曾夹在一群显要人物中去见过费什红衣主教。一天，皇帝来看他的舅父③，这位尊贵的本堂神甫正在前厅候见，皇上也恰巧走过。拿破仑看见这位老人用双好奇的眼睛瞧着他，便转过身来，突然问道：\\n\\n “瞧着我的那汉子是谁呀？”\\n\\n “陛下，”米里哀先生说，“您瞧一个汉子，我瞧一个天子。\\n\\n 彼此都还上算。” \\n\\n ②拿破仑于一八○四年三月十八日称帝，十二月二日加冕。\\n\\n ③指费什。\\n\\n 皇帝在当天晚上向红衣主教问明了这位本堂神甫的姓名。不久以后，米里哀先生极其诧异地得到被任为迪涅主教的消息。\\n\\n 此外，人们对米里哀先生初期生活所传述的轶事，哪些是真实的？谁也不知道。很少人知道米里哀这家人在革命以前的情况。\\n\\n 任何人初到一个说话的嘴多而思考的头脑少的小城里总有够他受的，米里哀先生所受的也不例外。尽管他是主教，并且正因为他是主教，他就得受。总之，牵涉到他名字的那些谈话，也许只是一些闲谈而已，内容不过是听来的三言两语和捕风捉影的东西，有时甚至连捕风捉影也说不上，照南方人那种强烈的话来说，只是“胡诌”而已。\\n\\n 不管怎样，他住在迪涅担任教职九年以后，当初成为那些小城市和小人们谈话的题材的闲话，都完全被丢在脑后了。没有谁再敢提到，甚至没有谁再敢回想那些闲话了。\\n\\n 米里哀先生到迪涅时有个老姑娘伴着他，这老姑娘便是比他小十岁的妹子巴狄斯丁姑娘。\\n\\n 他们的佣人只是一个和巴狄斯丁姑娘同年的女仆，名叫马格洛大娘，现在，她在做了“司铎先生的女仆”后，取得了这样一个双重头衔：姑娘的女仆和主教的管家。\\n\\n 巴狄斯丁姑娘是个身材瘦长、面貌清癯、性情温厚的人儿，她体现了“可敬”两个字所表达的理想，因为一个妇人如果要达到“可敬”的地步，似乎总得先做母亲。她从不曾有过美丽的时期，她的一生只是一连串圣洁的工作，这就使她的身体呈现白色和光彩；将近老年时，她具有我们所谓的那种“慈祥之美”。她青年时期的消瘦到她半老时，转成了一种清虚疏朗的神韵，令人想见她是一个天使。她简直是个神人，处女当之也有逊色。她的身躯，好象是阴影构成的，几乎没有足以显示性别的实体，只是一小撮透着微光的物质，秀长的眼睛老低垂着，我们可以说她是寄存在人间的天女。\\n\\n 马格洛大娘是个矮老、白胖、臃肿、忙碌不定、终日气喘吁吁的妇人，一则因为她操作勤劳，再则因为她有气喘病。\\n\\n 米里哀先生到任以后，人们就照将主教列在仅次于元帅地位的律令所规定的仪节，把他安顿在主教院里。市长和议长向他作了初次的拜访，而他，在他那一面，也向将军和省长作了初次的拜访。\\n\\n 部署既毕，全城静候主教执行任务。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4138.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
