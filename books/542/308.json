{"id":35895,"no":308,"title":"Part 5 Book 2 Chapter 5 Present Progress","content":"To-day the sewer is clean, cold, straight, correct. It almost realizes the ideal of what is understood in England by the word \"respectable.\" It is proper and grayish; laid out by rule and line; one might almost say as though it came out of a bandbox. It resembles a tradesman who has become a councillor of state. One can almost see distinctly there. The mire there comports itself with decency. At first, one might readily mistake it for one of those subterranean corridors, which were so common in former days, and so useful in flights of monarchs and princes, in those good old times, \"when the people loved their kings.\" The present sewer is a beautiful sewer; the pure style reigns there; the classical rectilinear alexandrine which, driven out of poetry, appears to have taken refuge in architecture, seems mingled with all the stones of that long, dark and whitish vault; each outlet is an arcade; the Rue de Rivoli serves as pattern even in the sewer. However, if the geometrical line is in place anywhere, it is certainly in the drainage trench of a great city. There, everything should be subordinated to the shortest road. The sewer has, nowadays, assumed a certain official aspect. The very police reports, of which it sometimes forms the subject, no longer are wanting in respect towards it. The words which characterize it in administrative language are sonorous and dignified. What used to be called a gut is now called a gallery; what used to be called a hole is now called a surveying orifice. Villon would no longer meet with his ancient temporary provisional lodging. This net-work of cellars has its immemorial population of prowlers, rodents, swarming in greater numbers than ever; from time to time, an aged and veteran rat risks his head at the window of the sewer and surveys the Parisians; but even these vermin grow tame, so satisfied are they with their subterranean palace. The cesspool no longer retains anything of its primitive ferocity. The rain, which in former days soiled the sewer, now washes it. Nevertheless, do not trust yourself too much to it. Miasmas still inhabit it. It is more hypocritical than irreproachable. The prefecture of police and the commission of health have done their best. But, in spite of all the processes of disinfection, it exhales, a vague, suspicious odor like Tartuffe after confession. \n Let us confess, that, taking it all in all, this sweeping is a homage which the sewer pays to civilization, and as, from this point of view, Tartuffe\u0027s conscience is a progress over the Augean stables, it is certain that the sewers of Paris have been improved.\n It is more than progress; it is transmutation. Between the ancient and the present sewer there is a revolution. What has effected this revolution?\n The man whom all the world forgets, and whom we have mentioned, Bruneseau.\n ①“体面”，原文为英文respectable。\n 无论如何，我们总得承认，打扫是阴渠向文明致敬，从这个观点看，达尔杜弗的良心较之奥革阿斯①的牛棚又前进了一步，巴黎的阴渠无疑得到了改良。 \n ①奥革阿斯（Augias），希腊厄利斯国王，他的牛棚里养着三千头牛，牛棚有三十年没打扫过。\n 这不仅是进步，这是蜕变，在古老的阴渠和今日的阴渠之间，曾有过一次革命。谁进行了这次革命呢？\n 是被众人遗忘而我们提到的勃吕纳梭。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4445.html","bookId":542,"book":{"id":542,"title":"Les Miserables悲惨世界","description":"简介： 故事发生在19世纪的法国，穷苦农民冉阿让因偷面包而入狱多年，终获假释却再次无视法律，不得不开始逃亡。被收留他的主教感化后，冉阿让决心洗心革面，开始新生活。十年后他成为成功的商人并当上市长，却一直受到铁面警官贾维尔锲而不舍地追捕。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1288579064ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
