{"id":35328,"no":17,"title":"Part Two Chapter 1 A Hand to the Plough","content":"With a heart full of the noblest phantasies, the most lofty aspirations; purified of the last trace of that popular egotism which makes the self-conscious striving for one’s own salvation antecedent to every other aim of life; beating high with an all-embracing affection for earth and the children of earth, bred of a natural ardour of disposition and nurtured upon the sweet and mighty thoughts of all great men; with a heart yearning for action of some kind, weary of a life bounded within the lines of self-study and introspection, desirous of nothing more than to efface the recollection of self in complete devotion to the needs of those million sufferers whose voices had long cried to her with ever-growing pathos, Helen Norman had set foot once more upon the shores of England. Commencing upon that day a new page in her diary, she headed it with the lines of Longfellow, as an appropriate motto: \\n\\n \\n\\n Let us then be up and doing, \\n\\n \\n\\n With a heart for any fate; \\n\\n \\n\\n Still achieving, still pursuing, \\n\\n \\n\\n Learn to labour and to wait. \\n\\n \\n\\n The first few days were spent in walks alone, which she planned each morning by reference to a map of London, choosing in preference those districts which she knew by reputation as mean and poverty-stricken. As yet she had never seen poverty in its worst shapes, and she now for the first time became acquainted with the appearance of a London slum. With a thin veil drawn close over her face, often with a step quickened by involuntary horror, or even fear, she walked in turn through the worst parts of Soho, through Seven Dials, and the thoroughfares which spread themselves around that reeking centre, through Drury Lane and Clare Market, through all the unutterable vileness which is to be found on the other side of the river, then through everything most heart-breaking that the wide extent of the East End has to show. In this way she learnt from actual experience what she had hitherto only been able to see in fancy, and it is but slight reproach to the powers of her imagination to say that never in her most fearful visions had she attained to a just appreciation of the reality. As she walked hurriedly along she would now and then behold sights which made the hot tears of pity or of indignation start to her eyes; but for the most part the ardour of a righteous wrath, to think that such things could be permitted to exist, dried up the fountain of tears, and only left her strengthening herself in firm resolve that what one determined heart and mind could effect towards the alleviation of all this hellish misery, that should be her aim as long as her life lasted. \\n\\n \\n\\n Before setting to her task she deemed it necessary to procure her guardian’s assent to what she was about to do, and, for the purpose of acquainting him with the designs, requested a quarter of an hour’s conversation with him in the library. This opportunity being obtained, she laid before him all her aims and aspirations in clear, direct language, every word of which seemed to burn and glow, as fresh from the anvil of her thought; and then requested his permission to enter upon this mode of life. Mr. Gresham manifested no surprise, it was part of his philosophy never to be surprised at anything, but he allowed several minutes to elapse before making any reply. \\n\\n \\n\\n “And how do you purpose setting about such a work, Helen?” he asked, at length, gazing at her with a half-suppressed ironical smile, which, however, could not hold its place upon his lips before the earnest, open gaze of his ward. “I suppose you must have some definite plan for — for getting rid of your money?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I beg that you will not think that I am going to be recklessly extravagant, on pretence of charity,” said Helen, in reply to the last phrase. “I shall indeed give money when I see it is needed, but I have already convinced myself that money can by no means be the principal instrument of one who sincerely wishes to benefit these poor people. On this point I have my own ideas.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “But would it not be better, if you are determined to trouble yourself so much about these tatterdemalions, to give your relief in the form of subscriptions to well-known charities, which have much better opportunities of doing good than any single individual can have?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Doubtless they have better opportunities,” returned Helen, “but what I have already seen convinces me that they do not use them. The efforts of. bodies are commendable and excellent — in their proper places. But for the work I see before me, individual effort is alone fitted; of that I am convinced.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “But, my dear child,” said Mr. Gresham, with a smile of indulgent pity, “you surely have not got the idea into your head that you are going alone the rounds of these pestilence-breeding slums? Have you the remotest notion of the kind of beings by whom they are inhabited?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Only too exact a notion. I have spent the last few days in penetrating the worst districts. I know precisely the nature of my task.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Gresham looked into his ward’s face, where exquisite beauty was heightened by a flash of generous ardour, and he felt, though he yet would not confess it, that here was a nature for which in his classification of mankind he had left no place. \\n\\n \\n\\n “But you altogether lack experience in such affairs,” he urged, compelled, in spite of himself, to assume a tone of serious argument very unusual in him. “You will be robbed and pillaged wherever you go.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “For my lack of experience I must try to find a remedy. It is my present intention to apply to some clergyman in one of these neighbourhoods, and to offer him my services in the capacity I have chosen for myself, asking him to afford me the benefit of the experience he must naturally have obtained in the fulfilment of his duties.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Then you will become what they call a Bible-reader.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I shall not willingly class myself under that head,” replied Helen, “but if I am convinced that good might in some instances be done by reading the Bible aloud, I shall have no hesitation in doing so.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Gresham smiled, with an expression of humorous despair, and began to pace the room. \\n\\n \\n\\n “May I hope to have your consent, Mr. Gresham, to what I propose?” asked Helen, when some minutes had thus elapsed. \\n\\n \\n\\n “If you proceed as you suggest,” said her guardian, “and act strictly under the advice of some clergyman, whom, bye-the-by, I must see and have a little talk with, I shall make no further objection, for I am perfectly convinced that a very brief trial will give you a wholesome distaste for these abominations. Would you like to know my opinion of the people you are going to endeavour to benefit?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I should, if you please, sir,” replied Helen, calmly. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Very well. In my opinion, then, they are not to be classed with human beings, but rather with the brutes. Persistent self-brutalisation, through many generations, by all the processes of odious vice which the brain of man has ever invented, has brought them to a condition worse, far worse, than that of the dogs or horses that do their bidding. It is my firm belief that their degeneration is actually and literally physical; that the fine organs of virtue in which we possess all that we have of the intellectual and refined, have absolutely perished from their frames; that you might as well endeavour to teach a pig to understand Euclid as to teach one of these gaol-birds to know and feel what is meant by honesty, virtue, kindness, intellectuality. That they have become such is, I say, the result of their own vices. Unless you can take all the children, one by one, as they are born in these kennels, and remove them to some part of the New World where they shall grow up under the best influences of every kind, so, by degrees, letting the old generations rot away in their foulness, and then, when they are all dead, set fire to the districts they inhabited, totally rebuild them, and fetch back to their renovated homes the young men and women who have grown to maturity, healthy, clean, and educated — unless you can do all that, you need never hope, Helen, to better the condition of the poor of London.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “That, I fear,” replied Helen, with a sweet smile, “would be beyond my power; and yet I will venture to persevere in the belief that I can better the condition of at least a few. This belief depends upon the view I have formed of their condition, and it is this: Without denying that their vices may have had very much to do with the misery they suffer under, I firmly believe that this misery is in the greatest degree the result of the criminal indifference and the actual cruelty and oppression of the higher ranks of society, those ranks out of which come the leaders of popular fashion and the actual governors of the country. And even those vices are in a very great measure the result of this indifference and oppression; for does it seem credible that not until this very year have the governors of England made any effort to provide adequate education, even of the simplest kind, for the poor of this country? I should not tell the truth if I denied that these wretched creatures excite horror and disgust in me as often as they excite pity, but I am glad to say that my reason outweighs my mere emotions, and the allowances it makes for them forbid me to regard them with absolute contempt. I will grant that they often seem mere beasts, but I cannot, I will not believe that this is more than seeming. The greatest men that the world has known have ever retained to the last a vivid faith in humanity. If ever I feel disposed to fall into doubt and despair I shall seek consolation in their words, and I doubt not I shall find it.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Very well, Helen,” replied Mr. Gresham, with a slight shrug, “far he it from me to act the domestic tyrant. Only acquaint me with your exact plans.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I will not fail to do so as soon as they are formed,” returned Helen. And so the interview concluded. \\n\\n \\n\\n After a few more days spent in investigation, in which she had no aid, Helen obtained the names of three clergymen to whom she determined to write, offering her services in their respective parishes for charitable and educational purposes. Two of these were Church of England clergymen, the third was a Dissenter. To the first she wrote as follows: — \\n\\n \\n\\n “Portland Place, “30th July, 1870. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Sir, \\n\\n \\n\\n “Having considerable leisure and some little means at my disposal, it is my desire to employ both in an effort to improve the condition, physical, moral, and intellectual, of at least a few among the multitudes of poverty-stricken people that inhabit. the worst districts of London. But as I am quite without experience in such work, and have no adequate knowledge of London, I should be glad if I could place myself under the direction of some clergyman whose acquaintance with such scenes of misery is extensive, and who would be glad of an earnest volunteer to give him some little assistance in his charitable endeavours. It is in consequence of this wish that I venture to address myself to you. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I must, however, refer to one point which is of essential importance to me. Though my age is but little more than nineteen, I have for some years devoted myself to serious study, one’ of the results of which has been that I am no longer able to conscientiously consider myself a member of any of the Christian Churches. Nothing is farther from my thoughts than a desire to press upon you the reasons which have led me to this attitude. I must merely say that for the present it is unalterable, and I could not undertake to devote attention to arguments intended for my conversion. Under these circumstances you will think it strange that I make these offers to a clergyman. My reason is, that as I am myself, I trust, quite free from bigotry in my beliefs, I can also hope that a minister of the Church will bear with what he may consider my errors, and not allow them to stand in the way of any usefulness of which I may be capable. I need hardly say that I should confine my attention solely to the bodily and mental condition of the poor, seeing that I believe it is their bodies and minds that most pressingly call for attention. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I trust, sir, that the earnestness of my motives may prove an excuse for my freedom in thus addressing you, and beg to remain, \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yours respectfully, “Helen Norman.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Alas for the na?veté which could lead a high-minded girl to despatch such a letter to a minister of the Church of England! Two days after sending this to the clergyman who stood first on the list, she received in reply the following note: — \\n\\n \\n\\n “Madam, “I am in receipt of your letter of the 30th July, but I may not say that I regret I cannot accept your offered services. Should I do so, I should be a traitor to the Church and to my God, introducing into my flock a wolf in sheep’s clothing, who would devour their souls as surely as Satan will devour the souls of all who, Testing on their pride of intellect, reject the authority of Holy Scripture and are guilty of the sin against the Holy Ghost. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I may add, however, that as money offered for good purposes does not lose in utility from the fact that the giver is devoid of that grace of God which passeth all understanding, and may possibly plead before the throne of the Almighty for the soul of such giver, if you shall be willing to allow me to add your name to the enclosed subscription list for the restoring St. ——‘s Church, I shall with pleasure receive your subscription, and have it acknowledged, with other names, in the daily papers. \\n\\n \\n\\n “In conclusion, I trust you may soon be brought to see the error of your ways, and to wash away in the blood of the Lamb their sins which, I am sure, must be as scarlet. I regret that the extent to which my leisure is occupied does not allow me time to engage in the work of your conversion. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yours, in hope and trust, “—————.” \\n\\n \\n\\n This letter caused Helen not a little mirth, and, on being communicated to Mr. Gresham, brought to his face one of those sarcastic smiles which were the best expression of his ordinary mood of mind. He read the present effusion with gusto. It so thoroughly confirmed his view with regard to a very large portion of mankind. \\n\\n \\n\\n Undaunted, Helen despatched the same letter to the second name upon her list, but, after waiting more than a week, she received no reply whatever. The Dissenting clergyman still remained; and to him at length she wrote. She received, almost by return of post, a note, requesting that she would appoint an hour at which he might have the honour of waiting upon her. Having immediately replied, Helen awaited the stranger’s arrival with some interest. \\n\\n \\n\\n At the appointed hour she repaired to the library, where she was shortly apprised, by a card, of the arrival of Mr. Edgar Walton Heatherley, who was accordingly introduced. \\n\\n \\n\\n Helen had exerted her imagination considerably in endeavours to depicture Mr. Heatherley’s personal appearance, and, strange to say, the original did not rudely overturn her preconceived notions. She liked the man as soon as she saw him. He was evidently young, and his countenance slightly florid in complexion, with but a moderate growth of rather reddish whiskers and moustache, had an open, pleasing, intelligent air, though its lines were not regular enough to constitute a handsome face. Its expression bespoke, moreover, considerable firmness. The eye was honest and cheerful, proclaiming immediately the total absence of all cant, hypocrisy, or bigotry. He was decidedly tall and almost athletic in frame, holding himself as upright as a soldier. It was apparent at the first glance that Mr. Heatherley was no town growth, but had drunk in health and spirits during his earlier years from the fresh breezes of meadow, wood and hill. He was a man whose character could at once be determined from his face and form. Inspiring confidence himself, he had the hearty manners of one who was wont to thoroughly confide in his acquaintances. Here there was no trace of the execrable theory of believing every man a rogue till he be proved honest. Rather was it written in plain characters upon his open brow, that he never suspected without overpowering cause, and, even if deceived seventy times seven, would not cease to cling to his gospel of eternal trust and hope. \\n\\n \\n\\n Helen advanced to meet him with her wonted open smile. They were friends from the first glance. After exchanging the ordinary greeting, they resumed seats, and Helen introduced the subject of the conversation. \\n\\n \\n\\n “My letter will have acquainted you with almost all that I wish to say,” she began. “Your reply contained nothing beyond the request for an interview. May I suppose that you look favourably upon my proposition?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “The character of your letter, Miss Norman,” returned the other, speaking in very firm and rather quick tones, “from the first inclined me to do so. But I am now not so sure as I was.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Indeed? Why not?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I am but little acquainted with the West End of London,” replied Mr. Heatherley, “and I did not know Portland Place at all. I fear that residence in the midst of such refinement is hardly a good preparation for work among our East End courts and alleys. Have you any idea, Miss Norman, of the character of the task for which you volunteer?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “A very exact idea, I believe, Mr. Heatherley.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “You have seen the worst part of the East End?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I believe so.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “And you think you possess the courage to face their horrors day after day?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I am sure of it, sir.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Heatherley examined the girl’s face for an instant, dropped his eyes, bit his lower lip and mused. \\n\\n \\n\\n “You will excuse my cross-examination, Miss Norman. Whatever I undertake it is with my whole heart. If I thought this were an idle fancy of a wealthy young lady, possessed of rather too much leisure, I should grieve that I had wasted time over it.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I like your frankness, Mr. Heatherley,” replied Helen, smilingly. “As far as I know my own character, I think I may say that I, also, whatever I undertake, do it with my whole heart. My energy has as yet had no fields for exercise but those of learning, it is true; yet I have there learned some confidence in my own powers of perseverance.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “So far, so good,” said the clergyman, who had keenly watched Helen’s countenance as she spoke. “But I believe you told me you were a minor, Miss Norman. Have you parents living, may I ask?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Neither parents nor any near relatives. I am living with my guardian, Mr. Gresham.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “And have you informed Mr. Gresham of your intention to undertake this work?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I have, and have obtained his consent, with the proviso that he should see and become acquainted with the clergyman under whose direction I placed myself.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Good,” replied Mr. Heatherley sententiously; then sunk into reflection. \\n\\n \\n\\n “You have not yet touched upon the second portion of my letter,” said Helen, at length, looking with some timidity into the clergyman’s face. The latter raised his eyes, and they gazed at each other for several seconds, neither faltering. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Am I right in concluding from the tenor of your letter,” asked the clergyman, “that you have no intention of propagating your special views among the poor people you visit?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “You are, Mr. Heatherley.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Would you oblige me by stating exactly in what light you regard the matter of religious teaching?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I will do so as well as I can. My own religion teaches me to confine my thoughts to the present world, and it appears to me that one of the most pressing needs under which the world suffers is that of attention to the bodily and mental state of the poorest classes. For my own part, I regard the necessity of their having enough food, and being able to read and write, as much more urgent than the necessity of their being taught religious dogmas, which, in my belief, would exercise a scarcely appreciable influence upon their lives. You, Mr. Heatherley, are, of course, of a different opinion in this matter. You exert yourself to the uttermost to make them religious; and, whilst you may do good in this, you certainly do no active harm. For the comprehension of my creeds, considerable culture is necessary, and it would be madness to attempt to make poor ignorant working-people understand them. Under these circumstances it appears to me that I cannot do better than devote my attention to clothing, feeding and in some degree teaching them; to the former two on the score of compassion, to the latter because it is the only true way of rendering the results of charity enduring.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Very well, Miss Norman. At least your position is intelligible. Such being the case, I suppose it would be impossible for you to join any of the charitable associations founded on a religious basis?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “If you think it possible, I had rather — at present, at all events — work alone.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “You have plans, doubtless? You have thought out methods of procedure?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I have thought much on the subject, but shall require much advice from you.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Well,” returned the clergyman, after a slight pause, “it would perhaps be the best way for us to walk over my neighbourhood together.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Certainly. When might I come to you?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Could we say tomorrow at ten?” asked Mr. Heatherley, in his decisive manner. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I shall be punctual,” replied: Helen, at once. “And now, if you will excuse me, I will inform Mr. Gresham that you are at liberty to see him.” \\n\\n \\n\\n They shook hands, Mr. Heatherley smiling pleasantly, as Helen repeated — “To-morrow at ten.” She then disappeared, and the next moment Mr. Gresham entered the room. \\n\\n \\n\\n Had Mr. Gresham been a sincere man, even to himself, he would have inwardly confessed that the applicability of his law of universal doubt had now found a second exception. In the depths of his heart he knew that Helen Norman was truth incarnate; and now on first beholding Mr. Heatherley he felt instinctively that here was a man in whom he could absolutely trust. But the yoke of old habit was too strong for him, and he commenced the conversation with that ironical smile which betokened distrust of all things human or divine. \\n\\n \\n\\n “You must understand, Mr. Heatherley,” he began, “that I have given my consent to this freak of Miss Norman’s simply because I wish her to be cured as quickly as possible of certain girlish fancies that have taken possession of her lately. She has just returned from a two years’ stay in Germany, and she appears to have come back a trifle eccentric. Vigorous treatment, I imagine, is the best for this ailment. Let her by all means disgust herself with a peep into these eastern dens of yours. I only hope she won’t bring us some infectious disease here, that’s all.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Miss Norman has not long exhibited these philanthropic tendencies, sir?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Pooh! — of course not. Only let her have a few days’ experience. She will perhaps throw away a little money, but that is fortunately of no great consequence. We shall have her back cured, and then an end of it.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Are you sure you gauge this young lady’s character quite correctly?” asked the clergyman, who had hitherto regarded Mr. Gresham’s face with an observant eye. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Do you imagine the contrary, Mr. Heatherley?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I do, sir.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “From anything in particular she has said to you?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “From her countenance and the tenor of her discourse. I fancy the trial will last longer than you imagine, Mr. Gresham.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Well, well; we shall see,” said the artist, with careless good-humour. “I confess to but little faith in enthusiasm of any kind.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “And yet, sir, it has been the most powerful operative force in the world’s history,” returned the clergyman, in his decisive manner. \\n\\n \\n\\n “That, of course, is a matter of argument,” said the artist, turning slightly. away. “But having seen you, Mr. Heatherley,” he pursued, “I have fulfilled my object, which was merely to be sure that my ward had placed herself in the care of a responsible man. Possibly you could find time to see me again, say this day week? We shall then see more clearly the course that events are likely to take.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I shall have pleasure in doing so,” returned the clergyman. \\n\\n \\n\\n Whereupon they parted, Mr. Gresham ascending to his studio, whistling a subdued air, and smiling the while; Mr. Heatherley turning his face eastward, musing much with serious countenance. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1455/43762.html","bookId":1365,"book":{"id":1365,"title":"Workers in the Dawn","description":"简介： This is an EXACT reproduction of a book published before 1923.
