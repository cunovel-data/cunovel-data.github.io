{"id":5721,"no":23,"title":"Chapter 23","content":"23:1 [hgb] 约 伯 回 答 说 ， [kjv] Then Job answered and said, [bbe] And Job made answer and said, 23:2 [hgb] 如 今 我 的 哀 告 还 算 为 悖 逆 。 我 的 责 罚 比 我 的 唉 哼 还 重 。 [kjv] Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning. [bbe] Even today my outcry is bitter; his hand is hard on my sorrow. 23:3 [hgb] 惟 愿 我 能 知 道 在 哪 里 可 以 寻 见 神 ， 能 到 他 的 台 前 。 [kjv] Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat! [bbe] If only I had knowledge of where he might be seen, so that I might come even to his seat! 23:4 [hgb] 我 就 在 他 面 前 将 我 的 案 件 陈 明 ， 满 口 辩 白 。 [kjv] I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments. [bbe] I would put my cause in order before him, and my mouth would be full of arguments. 23:5 [hgb] 我 必 知 道 他 回 答 我 的 言 语 ， 明 白 他 向 我 所 说 的 话 。 [kjv] I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me. [bbe] I would see what his answers would be, and have knowledge of what he would say to me. 23:6 [hgb] 他 岂 用 大 能 与 我 争 辩 吗 ？ 必 不 这 样 ， 他 必 理 会 我 。 [kjv] Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me. [bbe] Would he make use of his great power to overcome me? No, but he would give attention to me. 23:7 [hgb] 在 他 那 里 ， 正 直 人 可 以 与 他 辩 论 。 这 样 ， 我 必 永 远 脱 离 那 审 判 我 的 。 [kjv] There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge. [bbe] There an upright man might put his cause before him; and I would be free for ever from my judge. 23:8 [hgb] 只 是 ， 我 往 前 行 ， 他 不 在 那 里 ， 往 后 退 ， 也 不 能 见 他 。 [kjv] Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him: [bbe] See, I go forward, but he is not there; and back, but I do not see him; 23:9 [hgb] 他 在 左 边 行 事 ， 我 却 不 能 看 见 ， 在 右 边 隐 藏 ， 我 也 不 能 见 他 。 [kjv] On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him: [bbe] I am looking for him on the left hand, but there is no sign of him; and turning to the right, I am not able to see him. 23:10 [hgb] 然 而 他 知 道 我 所 行 的 路 。 他 试 炼 我 之 后 ， 我 必 如 精 金 。 [kjv] But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. [bbe] For he has knowledge of the way I take; after I have been tested I will come out like gold. 23:11 [hgb] 我 脚 追 随 他 的 步 履 。 我 谨 守 他 的 道 ， 并 不 偏 离 。 [kjv] My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined. [bbe] My feet have gone in his steps; I have kept in his way, without turning to one side or to the other. 23:12 [hgb] 他 嘴 唇 的 命 令 ， 我 未 曾 背 弃 。 我 看 重 他 口 中 的 言 语 ， 过 于 我 需 用 的 饮 食 。 [kjv] Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food. [bbe] I have never gone against the orders of his lips; the words of his mouth have been stored up in my heart. 23:13 [hgb] 只 是 他 心 志 已 定 ， 谁 能 使 他 转 意 呢 ？ 他 心 里 所 愿 的 ， 就 行 出 来 。 [kjv] But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth. [bbe] But his purpose is fixed and there is no changing it; and he gives effect to the desire of his soul. 23:14 [hgb] 他 向 我 所 定 的 ， 就 必 做 成 。 这 类 的 事 他 还 有 许 多 。 [kjv] For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him. [bbe] For what has been ordered for me by him will be gone through to the end: and his mind is full of such designs. 23:15 [hgb] 所 以 我 在 他 面 前 惊 惶 ， 我 思 念 这 事 ， 便 惧 怕 他 。 [kjv] Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him. [bbe] For this cause I am in fear before him, my thoughts of him overcome me. 23:16 [hgb] 神 使 我 丧 胆 ， 全 能 者 使 我 惊 惶 。 [kjv] For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me: [bbe] For God has made my heart feeble, and my mind is troubled before the Ruler of all. 23:17 [hgb] 我 的 恐 惧 ， 不 是 因 为 黑 暗 ， 也 不 是 因 为 幽 暗 蒙 蔽 我 的 脸 。 [kjv] Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face. [bbe] For I am overcome by the dark, and by the black night which is covering my face.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114/1626.html","bookId":183,"book":{"id":183,"title":"约伯记 Job","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 乌 斯 地 有 一 个 人 名 叫 约 伯 。 那 人 完 全 正 直 ， 敬 畏 神 ， 远 离 恶 事 。 [kjv] There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared G...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
