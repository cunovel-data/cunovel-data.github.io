{"id":5705,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 7","content":"7:1 [hgb] 人 在 世 上 岂 无 争 战 吗 ？ 他 的 日 子 不 像 雇 工 人 的 日 子 吗 ？ [kjv] Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling? [bbe] Has not man his ordered time of trouble on the earth? and are not his days like the days of a servant working for payment? 7:2 [hgb] 像 奴 仆 切 慕 黑 影 ， 像 雇 工 人 盼 望 工 价 。 [kjv] As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work: [bbe] As a servant desiring the shades of evening, and a workman looking for his payment: 7:3 [hgb] 我 也 照 样 经 过 困 苦 的 日 月 ， 夜 间 的 疲 乏 为 我 而 定 。 [kjv] So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me. [bbe] So I have for my heritage months of pain to no purpose, and nights of weariness are given to me. 7:4 [hgb] 我 躺 卧 的 时 候 便 说 ， 我 何 时 起 来 ， 黑 夜 就 过 去 呢 ？ 我 尽 是 反 来 覆 去 ， 直 到 天 亮 。 [kjv] When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day. [bbe] When I go to my bed, I say, When will it be time to get up? but the night is long, and I am turning from side to side till morning light. 7:5 [hgb] 我 的 肉 体 以 虫 子 和 尘 土 为 衣 。 我 的 皮 肤 才 收 了 口 又 重 新 破 裂 。 [kjv] My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome. [bbe] My flesh is covered with worms and dust; my skin gets hard and then is cracked again. 7:6 [hgb] 我 的 日 子 比 梭 更 快 ， 都 消 耗 在 无 指 望 之 中 。 [kjv] My days are swifter than a weaver\u0027s shuttle, and are spent without hope. [bbe] My days go quicker than the cloth-worker\u0027s thread, and come to an end without hope. 7:7 [hgb] 求 你 想 念 ， 我 的 生 命 不 过 是 一 口 气 。 我 的 眼 睛 必 不 再 见 福 乐 。 [kjv] O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good. [bbe] O, keep in mind that my life is wind: my eye will never again see good. 7:8 [hgb] 观 看 我 的 人 ， 他 的 眼 必 不 再 见 我 。 你 的 眼 目 要 看 我 ， 我 却 不 在 了 。 [kjv] The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not. [bbe] The eye of him who sees me will see me no longer: your eyes will be looking for me, but I will be gone. 7:9 [hgb] 云 彩 消 散 而 过 。 照 样 ， 人 下 阴 间 也 不 再 上 来 。 [kjv] As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more. [bbe] A cloud comes to an end and is gone; so he who goes down into the underworld comes not up again. 7:10 [hgb] 他 不 再 回 自 己 的 家 ， 故 土 也 不 再 认 识 他 。 [kjv] He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more. [bbe] He will not come back to his house, and his place will have no more knowledge of him. 7:11 [hgb] 我 不 禁 止 我 口 。 我 灵 愁 苦 ， 要 发 出 言 语 。 我 心 苦 恼 ， 要 吐 露 哀 情 。 [kjv] Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. [bbe] So I will not keep my mouth shut; I will let the words come from it in the pain of my spirit, my soul will make a bitter outcry. 7:12 [hgb] 我 对 神 说 ， 我 岂 是 洋 海 ， 岂 是 大 鱼 ， 你 竟 防 守 我 呢 ？ [kjv] Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me? [bbe] Am I a sea, or a sea-beast, that you put a watch over me? 7:13 [hgb] 若 说 ， 我 的 床 必 安 慰 我 ， 我 的 榻 必 解 释 我 的 苦 情 。 [kjv] When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint; [bbe] When I say, In my bed I will have comfort, there I will get rest from my disease; 7:14 [hgb] 你 就 用 梦 惊 骇 我 ， 用 异 象 恐 吓 我 。 [kjv] Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions: [bbe] Then you send dreams to me, and visions of fear; 7:15 [hgb] 甚 至 我 宁 肯 噎 死 ， 宁 肯 死 亡 ， 胜 似 留 我 这 一 身 的 骨 头 。 [kjv] So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life. [bbe] So that a hard death seems better to my soul than my pains. 7:16 [hgb] 我 厌 弃 性 命 ， 不 愿 永 活 。 你 任 凭 我 吧 ， 因 我 的 日 子 都 是 虚 空 。 [kjv] I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity. [bbe] I have no desire for life, I would not be living for ever! Keep away from me, for my days are as a breath. 7:17 [hgb] 人 算 什 么 ， 你 竟 看 他 为 大 ， 将 他 放 在 心 上 ， [kjv] What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him? [bbe] What is man, that you have made him great, and that your attention is fixed on him, 7:18 [hgb] 每 早 鉴 察 他 ， 时 刻 试 验 他 。 [kjv] And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment? [bbe] And that your hand is on him every morning, and that you are testing him every minute? 7:19 [hgb] 你 到 何 时 才 转 眼 不 看 我 ， 才 任 凭 我 咽 下 唾 沫 呢 ？ [kjv] How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle? [bbe] How long will it be before your eyes are turned away from me, so that I may have a minute\u0027s breathing-space? 7:20 [hgb] 鉴 察 人 的 主 阿 ， 我 若 有 罪 ， 于 你 何 妨 ？ 为 何 以 我 当 你 的 箭 靶 子 ， 使 我 厌 弃 自 己 的 性 命 ？ [kjv] I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself? [bbe] If I have done wrong, what have I done to you, O keeper of men? why have you made me a mark for your blows, so that I am a weariness to myself? 7:21 [hgb] 为 何 不 赦 免 我 的 过 犯 ， 除 掉 我 的 罪 孽 。 我 现 今 要 躺 卧 在 尘 土 中 。 你 要 殷 勤 地 寻 找 我 ， 我 却 不 在 了 。 [kjv] And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be. [bbe] And why do you not take away my sin, and let my wrongdoing be ended? for now I go down to the dust, and you will be searching for me with care, but I will be gone.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114/1610.html","bookId":183,"book":{"id":183,"title":"约伯记 Job","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 乌 斯 地 有 一 个 人 名 叫 约 伯 。 那 人 完 全 正 直 ， 敬 畏 神 ， 远 离 恶 事 。 [kjv] There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared G...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
