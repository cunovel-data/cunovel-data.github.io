{"id":5719,"no":21,"title":"Chapter 21","content":"21:1 [hgb] 约 伯 回 答 说 ， \\n\\n [kjv] But Job answered and said, \\n\\n [bbe] Then Job made answer and said, \\n\\n 21:2 [hgb] 你 们 要 细 听 我 的 言 语 ， 就 算 是 你 们 安 慰 我 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations. \\n\\n [bbe] Give attention with care to my words; and let this be your comfort. \\n\\n 21:3 [hgb] 请 宽 容 我 ， 我 又 要 说 话 。 说 了 以 后 ， 任 凭 你 们 嗤 笑 吧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on. \\n\\n [bbe] Let me say what is in my mind, and after that, go on making sport of me. \\n\\n 21:4 [hgb] 我 岂 是 向 人 诉 冤 ， 为 何 不 焦 急 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled? \\n\\n [bbe] As for me, is my outcry against man? is it then to be wondered at if my spirit is troubled? \\n\\n 21:5 [hgb] 你 们 要 看 着 我 而 惊 奇 ， 用 手 捂 口 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth. \\n\\n [bbe] Take note of me and be full of wonder, put your hand on your mouth. \\n\\n 21:6 [hgb] 我 每 逢 思 想 ， 心 就 惊 惶 ， 浑 身 战 兢 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh. \\n\\n [bbe] At the very thought of it my flesh is shaking with fear. \\n\\n 21:7 [hgb] 恶 人 为 何 存 活 ， 享 大 寿 数 ， 势 力 强 盛 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power? \\n\\n [bbe] Why is life given to the evil-doers? why do they become old and strong in power? \\n\\n 21:8 [hgb] 他 们 眼 见 儿 孙 ， 和 他 们 一 同 坚 立 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes. \\n\\n [bbe] Their children are ever with them, and their offspring before their eyes. \\n\\n 21:9 [hgb] 他 们 的 家 宅 平 安 无 惧 。 神 的 杖 也 不 加 在 他 们 身 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them. \\n\\n [bbe] Their houses are free from fear, and the rod of God does not come on them. \\n\\n 21:10 [hgb] 他 们 的 公 牛 孳 生 而 不 断 绝 。 母 牛 下 犊 而 不 掉 胎 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf. \\n\\n [bbe] Their ox is ready at all times to give seed; their cow gives birth, without dropping her young. \\n\\n 21:11 [hgb] 他 们 打 发 小 孩 子 出 去 ， 多 如 羊 群 。 他 们 的 儿 女 踊 跃 跳 舞 。 \\n\\n [kjv] They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance. \\n\\n [bbe] They send out their young ones like a flock, and their children have pleasure in the dance, \\n\\n 21:12 [hgb] 他 们 随 着 琴 鼓 歌 唱 ， 又 因 箫 声 欢 喜 。 \\n\\n [kjv] They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ. \\n\\n [bbe] They make songs to the instruments of music, and are glad at the sound of the pipe. \\n\\n 21:13 [hgb] 他 们 度 日 诸 事 亨 通 ， 转 眼 下 入 阴 间 。 \\n\\n [kjv] They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave. \\n\\n [bbe] Their days come to an end without trouble, and suddenly they go down to the underworld. \\n\\n 21:14 [hgb] 他 们 对 神 说 ， 离 开 我 们 吧 。 我 们 不 愿 晓 得 你 的 道 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. \\n\\n [bbe] Though they said to God, Go away from us, for we have no desire for the knowledge of your ways. \\n\\n 21:15 [hgb] 全 能 者 是 谁 ， 我 们 何 必 事 奉 他 呢 ？ 求 告 他 有 什 么 益 处 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him? \\n\\n [bbe] What is the Ruler of all, that we may give him worship? and what profit is it to us to make prayer to him? \\n\\n 21:16 [hgb] 看 哪 ， 他 们 亨 通 不 在 乎 自 己 。 恶 人 所 谋 定 的 离 我 好 远 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me. \\n\\n [bbe] Truly, is not their well-being in their power? (The purpose of the evil-doers is far from me.) \\n\\n 21:17 [hgb] 恶 人 的 灯 何 尝 熄 灭 。 患 难 何 尝 临 到 他 们 呢 ？ 神 何 尝 发 怒 ， 向 他 们 分 散 灾 祸 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger. \\n\\n [bbe] How frequently is the light of the evil-doers put out, or does trouble come on them? how frequently does his wrath take them with cords? \\n\\n 21:18 [hgb] 他 们 何 尝 像 风 前 的 碎 秸 ， 如 暴 风 刮 去 的 糠 秕 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away. \\n\\n [bbe] How frequently are they as dry stems before the wind, or as grass taken away by the storm-wind? \\n\\n 21:19 [hgb] 你 们 说 ， 神 为 恶 人 的 儿 女 积 蓄 罪 孽 。 我 说 ， 不 如 本 人 受 报 ， 好 使 他 亲 自 知 道 。 \\n\\n [kjv] God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it. \\n\\n [bbe] You say, God keeps punishment stored up for his children. Let him send it on the man himself, so that he may have the punishment of it! \\n\\n 21:20 [hgb] 愿 他 亲 眼 看 见 自 己 败 亡 ， 亲 自 饮 全 能 者 的 忿 怒 。 \\n\\n [kjv] His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty. \\n\\n [bbe] Let his eyes see his trouble, and let him be full of the wrath of the Ruler of all! \\n\\n 21:21 [hgb] 他 的 岁 月 既 尽 ， 他 还 顾 他 本 家 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst? \\n\\n [bbe] For what interest has he in his house after him, when the number of his months is ended? \\n\\n 21:22 [hgb] 神 既 审 判 那 在 高 位 的 ， 谁 能 将 知 识 教 训 他 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high. \\n\\n [bbe] Is anyone able to give teaching to God? for he is the judge of those who are on high. \\n\\n 21:23 [hgb] 有 人 至 死 身 体 强 壮 ， 尽 得 平 靖 安 逸 。 \\n\\n [kjv] One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet. \\n\\n [bbe] One comes to his end in complete well-being, full of peace and quiet: \\n\\n 21:24 [hgb] 他 的 奶 桶 充 满 ， 他 的 骨 髓 滋 润 。 \\n\\n [kjv] His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow. \\n\\n [bbe] His buckets are full of milk, and there is no loss of strength in his bones. \\n\\n 21:25 [hgb] 有 人 至 死 心 中 痛 苦 ， 终 身 未 尝 福 乐 的 滋 味 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure. \\n\\n [bbe] And another comes to his end with a bitter soul, without ever tasting good. \\n\\n 21:26 [hgb] 他 们 一 样 躺 卧 在 尘 土 中 ， 都 被 虫 子 遮 盖 。 \\n\\n [kjv] They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them. \\n\\n [bbe] Together they go down to the dust, and are covered by the worm. \\n\\n 21:27 [hgb] 我 知 道 你 们 的 意 思 ， 并 诬 害 我 的 计 谋 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me. \\n\\n [bbe] See, I am conscious of your thoughts, and of your violent purposes against me; \\n\\n 21:28 [hgb] 你 们 说 ， 霸 者 的 房 屋 在 哪 里 ？ 恶 人 住 过 的 帐 棚 在 哪 里 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked? \\n\\n [bbe] For you say, Where is the house of the ruler, and where is the tent of the evil-doer? \\n\\n 21:29 [hgb] 你 们 岂 没 有 询 问 过 路 的 人 吗 ？ 不 知 道 他 们 所 引 的 证 据 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens, \\n\\n [bbe] Have you not put the question to the travellers, and do you not take note of their experience? \\n\\n 21:30 [hgb] 就 是 恶 人 在 祸 患 的 日 子 得 存 留 ， 在 发 怒 的 日 子 得 逃 脱 。 \\n\\n [kjv] That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath. \\n\\n [bbe] How the evil man goes free in the day of trouble, and has salvation in the day of wrath? \\n\\n 21:31 [hgb] 他 所 行 的 ， 有 谁 当 面 给 他 说 明 。 他 所 做 的 ， 有 谁 报 应 他 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done? \\n\\n [bbe] Who will make his way clear to his face? and if he has done a thing, who gives him punishment for it? \\n\\n 21:32 [hgb] 然 而 他 要 被 抬 到 茔 地 ， 并 有 人 看 守 坟 墓 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb. \\n\\n [bbe] He is taken to his last resting-place, and keeps watch over it. \\n\\n 21:33 [hgb] 他 要 以 谷 中 的 土 块 为 甘 甜 ， 在 他 以 先 去 的 无 数 ， 在 他 以 后 去 的 更 多 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him. \\n\\n [bbe] The earth of the valley covering his bones is sweet to him, and all men come after him, as there were unnumbered before him. \\n\\n 21:34 [hgb] 你 们 对 答 的 话 中 既 都 错 谬 ， 怎 么 徒 然 安 慰 我 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood? \\n\\n [bbe] Why then do you give me comfort with words in which there is no profit, when you see that there is nothing in your answers but deceit? \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114/1624.html","bookId":183,"book":{"id":183,"title":"约伯记 Job","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 乌 斯 地 有 一 个 人 名 叫 约 伯 。 那 人 完 全 正 直 ， 敬 畏 神 ， 远 离 恶 事 。 [kjv] There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared G...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
