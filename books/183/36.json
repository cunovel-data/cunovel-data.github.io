{"id":5734,"no":36,"title":"Chapter 36","content":"36:1 [hgb] 以 利 户 又 接 着 说 ， [kjv] Elihu also proceeded, and said, [bbe] And Elihu went on to say, 36:2 [hgb] 你 再 容 我 片 时 ， 我 就 指 示 你 ， 因 我 还 有 话 为 神 说 。 [kjv] Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God\u0027s behalf. [bbe] Give me a little more time, and I will make it clear to you; for I have still something to say for God. 36:3 [hgb] 我 要 将 所 知 道 的 从 远 处 引 来 ， 将 公 义 归 给 造 我 的 主 。 [kjv] I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. [bbe] I will get my knowledge from far, and I will give righteousness to my Maker. 36:4 [hgb] 我 的 言 语 真 不 虚 谎 。 有 知 识 全 备 的 与 你 同 在 。 [kjv] For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee. [bbe] For truly my words are not false; one who has all knowledge is talking with you. 36:5 [hgb] 神 有 大 能 ， 并 不 藐 视 人 。 他 的 智 慧 甚 广 。 [kjv] Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom. [bbe] Truly, God gives up the hard-hearted, and will not give life to the sinner. 36:6 [hgb] 他 不 保 护 恶 人 的 性 命 ， 却 为 困 苦 人 伸 冤 。 [kjv] He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor. [bbe] His eyes are ever on the upright, and he gives to the crushed their right; 36:7 [hgb] 他 时 常 看 顾 义 人 ， 使 他 们 和 君 王 同 坐 宝 座 ， 永 远 要 被 高 举 。 [kjv] He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted. [bbe] Lifting them up to the seat of kings, and making them safe for ever. 36:8 [hgb] 他 们 若 被 锁 链 捆 住 ， 被 苦 难 的 绳 索 缠 住 ， [kjv] And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction; [bbe] And if they have been prisoned in chains, and taken in cords of trouble, 36:9 [hgb] 他 就 把 他 们 的 作 为 ， 和 过 犯 指 示 他 们 ， 叫 他 们 知 道 有 骄 傲 的 行 动 。 [kjv] Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded. [bbe] Then he makes clear to them what they have done, even their evil works in which they have taken pride. 36:10 [hgb] 他 也 开 通 他 们 的 耳 朵 ， 得 受 教 训 ， 吩 咐 他 们 离 开 罪 孽 转 回 。 [kjv] He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity. [bbe] Their ear is open to his teaching, and he gives them orders so that their hearts may be turned from evil. 36:11 [hgb] 他 们 若 听 从 事 奉 他 ， 就 必 度 日 亨 通 ， 历 年 福 乐 。 [kjv] If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures. [bbe] If they give ear to his voice, and do his word, then he gives them long life, and years full of pleasure. 36:12 [hgb] 若 不 听 从 ， 就 要 被 刀 杀 灭 ， 无 知 无 识 而 死 。 [kjv] But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge. [bbe] But if not, they come to their end, and give up their breath without knowledge. 36:13 [hgb] 那 心 中 不 敬 虔 的 人 积 蓄 怒 气 。 神 捆 绑 他 们 ， 他 们 竟 不 求 救 。 [kjv] But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them. [bbe] Those who have no fear of God keep wrath stored up in their hearts; they give no cry for help when they are made prisoners. 36:14 [hgb] 必 在 青 年 时 死 亡 ， 与 污 秽 人 一 样 丧 命 。 [kjv] They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean. [bbe] They come to their end while they are still young, their life is short like that of those who are used for sex purposes in the worship of their gods. 36:15 [hgb] 神 借 着 困 苦 救 拔 困 苦 人 ， 趁 他 们 受 欺 压 ， 开 通 他 们 的 耳 朵 。 [kjv] He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression. [bbe] He makes the wrong done to the poor the way of their salvation, opening their ears by their trouble. 36:16 [hgb] 神 也 必 引 你 出 离 患 难 ， 进 入 宽 阔 不 狭 窄 之 地 。 摆 在 你 席 上 的 必 满 有 肥 甘 。 [kjv] Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness. [bbe] ... 36:17 [hgb] 但 你 满 口 有 恶 人 批 评 的 言 语 。 判 断 和 刑 罚 抓 住 你 。 [kjv] But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee. [bbe] ... 36:18 [hgb] 不 可 容 忿 怒 触 动 你 ， 使 你 不 服 责 罚 。 也 不 可 因 赎 价 大 就 偏 行 。 [kjv] Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee. [bbe] ... 36:19 [hgb] 你 的 呼 求 （ 呼 求 或 作 资 财 ） ， 或 是 你 一 切 的 势 力 ， 果 有 灵 验 ， 叫 你 不 受 患 难 吗 ？ [kjv] Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength. [bbe] ... 36:20 [hgb] 不 要 切 慕 黑 夜 ， 就 是 众 民 在 本 处 被 除 灭 的 时 候 。 [kjv] Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place. [bbe] ... 36:21 [hgb] 你 要 谨 慎 ， 不 可 重 看 罪 孽 ， 因 你 选 择 罪 孽 ， 过 于 选 择 苦 难 。 [kjv] Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction. [bbe] Take care not to be turned to sin, for you have taken evil for your part in place of sorrow. 36:22 [hgb] 神 行 事 有 高 大 的 能 力 。 教 训 人 的 有 谁 像 他 呢 ？ [kjv] Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him? [bbe] Truly God is lifted up in strength; who is a ruler like him? 36:23 [hgb] 谁 派 定 他 的 道 路 ？ 谁 能 说 ， 你 所 行 的 不 义 ？ [kjv] Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity? [bbe] Who ever gave orders to him, or said to him, You have done wrong? 36:24 [hgb] 你 不 可 忘 记 称 赞 他 所 行 的 为 大 ， 就 是 人 所 歌 颂 的 。 [kjv] Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold. [bbe] See that you give praise to his work, about which men make songs. 36:25 [hgb] 他 所 行 的 ， 万 人 都 看 见 ， 世 人 也 从 远 处 观 看 。 [kjv] Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off. [bbe] All people are looking on it; man sees it from far. 36:26 [hgb] 神 为 大 ， 我 们 不 能 全 知 ， 他 的 年 数 不 能 测 度 。 [kjv] Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out. [bbe] Truly, God is great, greater than all our knowledge; the number of his years may not be searched out. 36:27 [hgb] 他 吸 取 水 点 ， 这 水 点 从 云 雾 中 就 变 成 雨 。 [kjv] For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof: [bbe] For he takes up the drops from the sea; he sends them through his mist as rain, 36:28 [hgb] 云 彩 将 雨 落 下 ， 沛 然 降 与 世 人 。 [kjv] Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly. [bbe] Flowing down from the sky, and dropping on the peoples. 36:29 [hgb] 谁 能 明 白 云 彩 如 何 铺 张 ， 和 神 行 宫 的 雷 声 呢 ？ [kjv] Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle? [bbe] And who has knowledge of how the clouds are stretched out, or of the thunders of his tent? 36:30 [hgb] 他 将 亮 光 普 照 在 自 己 的 四 围 。 他 又 遮 覆 海 底 。 [kjv] Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea. [bbe] See, he is stretching out his mist, covering the tops of the mountains with it. 36:31 [hgb] 他 用 这 些 审 判 众 民 ， 且 赐 丰 富 的 粮 食 。 [kjv] For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance. [bbe] For by these he gives food to the peoples, and bread in full measure. 36:32 [hgb] 他 以 电 光 遮 手 ， 命 闪 电 击 中 敌 人 （ 或 作 中 了 靶 子 ） 。 [kjv] With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt. [bbe] He takes the light in his hands, sending it against the mark. 36:33 [hgb] 所 发 的 雷 声 显 明 他 的 作 为 ， 又 向 牲 畜 指 明 要 起 暴 风 。 [kjv] The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour. [bbe] The thunder makes clear his passion, and the storm gives news of his wrath.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114/1639.html","bookId":183,"book":{"id":183,"title":"约伯记 Job","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 乌 斯 地 有 一 个 人 名 叫 约 伯 。 那 人 完 全 正 直 ， 敬 畏 神 ， 远 离 恶 事 。 [kjv] There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared G...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
