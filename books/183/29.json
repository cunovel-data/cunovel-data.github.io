{"id":5727,"no":29,"title":"Chapter 29","content":"29:1 [hgb] 约 伯 又 接 着 说 ， \\n\\n [kjv] Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, \\n\\n [bbe] And Job again took up the word and said, \\n\\n 29:2 [hgb] 惟 愿 我 的 景 况 如 从 前 的 月 份 ， 如 神 保 守 我 的 日 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me; \\n\\n [bbe] If only I might again be as I was in the months which are past, in the days when God was watching over me! \\n\\n 29:3 [hgb] 那 时 他 的 灯 照 在 我 头 上 。 我 借 他 的 光 行 过 黑 暗 。 \\n\\n [kjv] When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness; \\n\\n [bbe] When his light was shining over my head, and when I went through the dark by his light. \\n\\n 29:4 [hgb] 我 愿 如 壮 年 的 时 候 ， 那 时 我 在 帐 棚 中 。 神 待 我 有 密 友 之 情 。 \\n\\n [kjv] As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle; \\n\\n [bbe] As I was in my flowering years, when my tent was covered by the hand of God; \\n\\n 29:5 [hgb] 全 能 者 仍 与 我 同 在 。 我 的 儿 女 都 环 绕 我 。 \\n\\n [kjv] When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me; \\n\\n [bbe] While the Ruler of all was still with me, and my children were round me; \\n\\n 29:6 [hgb] 奶 多 可 洗 我 的 脚 。 磐 石 为 我 出 油 成 河 。 \\n\\n [kjv] When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil; \\n\\n [bbe] When my steps were washed with milk, and rivers of oil were flowing out of the rock for me. \\n\\n 29:7 [hgb] 我 出 到 城 门 ， 在 街 上 设 立 座 位 。 \\n\\n [kjv] When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street! \\n\\n [bbe] When I went out of my door to go up to the town, and took my seat in the public place, \\n\\n 29:8 [hgb] 少 年 人 见 我 而 回 避 ， 老 年 人 也 起 身 站 立 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up. \\n\\n [bbe] The young men saw me, and went away, and the old men got up from their seats; \\n\\n 29:9 [hgb] 王 子 都 停 止 说 话 ， 用 手 捂 口 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth. \\n\\n [bbe] The rulers kept quiet, and put their hands on their mouths; \\n\\n 29:10 [hgb] 首 领 静 默 无 声 ， 舌 头 贴 住 上 膛 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth. \\n\\n [bbe] The chiefs kept back their words, and their tongues were joined to the roofs of their mouths. \\n\\n 29:11 [hgb] 耳 朵 听 我 的 ， 就 称 我 有 福 。 眼 睛 看 我 的 ， 便 称 赞 我 。 \\n\\n [kjv] When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me: \\n\\n [bbe] For when it came to their ears, men said that I was truly happy; and when their eyes saw, they gave witness to me; \\n\\n 29:12 [hgb] 因 我 拯 救 哀 求 的 困 苦 人 ， 和 无 人 帮 助 的 孤 儿 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him. \\n\\n [bbe] For I was a saviour to the poor when he was crying for help, to the child with no father, and to him who had no supporter. \\n\\n 29:13 [hgb] 将 要 灭 亡 的 为 我 祝 福 。 我 也 使 寡 妇 心 中 欢 乐 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow\u0027s heart to sing for joy. \\n\\n [bbe] The blessing of him who was near to destruction came on me, and I put a song of joy into the widow\u0027s heart. \\n\\n 29:14 [hgb] 我 以 公 义 为 衣 服 ， 以 公 平 为 外 袍 和 冠 冕 。 \\n\\n [kjv] I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem. \\n\\n [bbe] I put on righteousness as my clothing, and was full of it; right decisions were to me a robe and a head-dress. \\n\\n 29:15 [hgb] 我 为 瞎 子 的 眼 ， 瘸 子 的 脚 。 \\n\\n [kjv] I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame. \\n\\n [bbe] I was eyes to the blind, and feet to him who had no power of walking. \\n\\n 29:16 [hgb] 我 为 穷 乏 人 的 父 ， 素 不 认 识 的 人 ， 我 查 明 他 的 案 件 。 \\n\\n [kjv] I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out. \\n\\n [bbe] I was a father to the poor, searching out the cause of him who was strange to me. \\n\\n 29:17 [hgb] 我 打 破 不 义 之 人 的 牙 床 ， 从 他 牙 齿 中 夺 了 所 抢 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth. \\n\\n [bbe] By me the great teeth of the evil-doer were broken, and I made him give up what he had violently taken away. \\n\\n 29:18 [hgb] 我 便 说 ， 我 必 死 在 家 中 （ 原 文 作 窝 中 ） ， 必 增 添 我 的 日 子 ， 多 如 尘 沙 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand. \\n\\n [bbe] Then I said, I will come to my end with my children round me, my days will be as the sand in number; \\n\\n 29:19 [hgb] 我 的 根 长 到 水 边 ， 露 水 终 夜 沾 在 我 的 枝 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch. \\n\\n [bbe] My root will be open to the waters, and the night mist will be on my branches, \\n\\n 29:20 [hgb] 我 的 荣 耀 在 身 上 增 新 ， 我 的 弓 在 手 中 日 强 。 \\n\\n [kjv] My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand. \\n\\n [bbe] My glory will be ever new, and my bow will be readily bent in my hand. \\n\\n 29:21 [hgb] 人 听 见 我 而 仰 望 ， 静 默 等 候 我 的 指 教 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel. \\n\\n [bbe] Men gave ear to me, waiting and keeping quiet for my suggestions. \\n\\n 29:22 [hgb] 我 说 话 之 后 ， 他 们 就 不 再 说 。 我 的 言 语 像 雨 露 滴 在 他 们 身 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them. \\n\\n [bbe] After I had said what was in my mind, they were quiet and let my words go deep into their hearts; \\n\\n 29:23 [hgb] 他 们 仰 望 我 如 仰 望 雨 ， 又 张 开 口 如 切 慕 春 雨 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain. \\n\\n [bbe] They were waiting for me as for the rain, opening their mouths wide as for the spring rains. \\n\\n 29:24 [hgb] 他 们 不 敢 自 信 ， 我 就 向 他 们 含 笑 。 他 们 不 使 我 脸 上 的 光 改 变 。 \\n\\n [kjv] If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down. \\n\\n [bbe] I was laughing at them when they had no hope, and the light of my face was never clouded by their fear. \\n\\n 29:25 [hgb] 我 为 他 们 选 择 道 路 ， 又 坐 首 位 。 我 如 君 王 在 军 队 中 居 住 ， 又 如 吊 丧 的 安 慰 伤 心 的 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners. \\n\\n [bbe] I took my place as a chief, guiding them on their way, and I was as a king among his army. ... \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114/1632.html","bookId":183,"book":{"id":183,"title":"约伯记 Job","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 乌 斯 地 有 一 个 人 名 叫 约 伯 。 那 人 完 全 正 直 ， 敬 畏 神 ， 远 离 恶 事 。 [kjv] There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job;
