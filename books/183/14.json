{"id":5712,"no":14,"title":"Chapter 14","content":"14:1 [hgb] 人 为 妇 人 所 生 ， 日 子 短 少 ， 多 有 患 难 。 [kjv] Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. [bbe] As for man, the son of woman, his days are short and full of trouble. 14:2 [hgb] 出 来 如 花 ， 又 被 割 下 。 飞 去 如 影 ， 不 能 存 留 。 [kjv] He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. [bbe] He comes out like a flower, and is cut down: he goes in flight like a shade, and is never seen again. 14:3 [hgb] 这 样 的 人 你 岂 睁 眼 看 他 吗 ？ 又 叫 我 来 受 审 吗 ？ [kjv] And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee? [bbe] Is it on such a one as this that your eyes are fixed, with the purpose of judging him? 14:4 [hgb] 谁 能 使 洁 净 之 物 出 于 污 秽 之 中 呢 ？ 无 论 谁 也 不 能 。 [kjv] Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one. [bbe] If only a clean thing might come out of an unclean! But it is not possible. 14:5 [hgb] 人 的 日 子 既 然 限 定 ， 他 的 月 数 在 你 那 里 ， 你 也 派 定 他 的 界 限 ， 使 他 不 能 越 过 。 [kjv] Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass; [bbe] If his days are ordered, and you have knowledge of the number of his months, having given him a fixed limit past which he may not go; 14:6 [hgb] 便 求 你 转 眼 不 看 他 ， 使 他 得 歇 息 。 直 等 他 像 雇 工 人 完 毕 他 的 日 子 。 [kjv] Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day. [bbe] Let your eyes be turned away from him, and take your hand from him, so that he may have pleasure at the end of his day, like a servant working for payment. 14:7 [hgb] 树 若 被 砍 下 ， 还 可 指 望 发 芽 ， 嫩 枝 生 长 不 息 。 [kjv] For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. [bbe] For there is hope of a tree; if it is cut down, it will come to life again, and its branches will not come to an end. 14:8 [hgb] 其 根 虽 然 衰 老 在 地 里 ， 干 也 死 在 土 中 。 [kjv] Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground; [bbe] Though its root may be old in the earth, and its cut-off end may be dead in the dust; 14:9 [hgb] 及 至 得 了 水 气 ， 还 要 发 芽 ， 又 长 枝 条 ， 像 新 栽 的 树 一 样 。 [kjv] Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant. [bbe] Still, at the smell of water, it will make buds, and put out branches like a young plant. 14:10 [hgb] 但 人 死 亡 而 消 灭 。 他 气 绝 ， 竟 在 何 处 呢 ？ [kjv] But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he? [bbe] But man comes to his death and is gone: he gives up his spirit, and where is he? 14:11 [hgb] 海 中 的 水 绝 尽 ， 江 河 消 散 干 涸 。 [kjv] As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up: [bbe] The waters go from a pool, and a river becomes waste and dry; 14:12 [hgb] 人 也 是 如 此 ， 躺 下 不 再 起 来 。 等 到 天 没 有 了 ， 仍 不 得 复 醒 ， 也 不 得 从 睡 中 唤 醒 。 [kjv] So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep. [bbe] So man goes down to his last resting-place and comes not again: till the heavens come to an end, they will not be awake or come out of their sleep. 14:13 [hgb] 惟 愿 你 把 我 藏 在 阴 间 ， 存 于 隐 密 处 ， 等 你 的 忿 怒 过 去 。 愿 你 为 我 定 了 日 期 ， 记 念 我 。 [kjv] O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me! [bbe] If only you would keep me safe in the underworld, putting me in a secret place till your wrath is past, giving me a fixed time when I might come to your memory again! 14:14 [hgb] 人 若 死 了 岂 能 再 活 呢 ？ 我 只 要 在 我 一 切 争 战 的 日 子 ， 等 我 被 释 放 的 时 候 来 到 （ 被 释 放 或 作 改 变 ） 。 [kjv] If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come. [bbe] If death takes a man, will he come to life again? All the days of my trouble I would be waiting, till the time came for me to be free. 14:15 [hgb] 你 呼 叫 ， 我 便 回 答 。 你 手 所 做 的 ， 你 必 羡 慕 。 [kjv] Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands. [bbe] At the sound of your voice I would give an answer, and you would have a desire for the work of your hands. 14:16 [hgb] 但 如 今 你 数 点 我 的 脚 步 ， 岂 不 窥 察 我 的 罪 过 吗 ？ [kjv] For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin? [bbe] For now my steps are numbered by you, and my sin is not overlooked. 14:17 [hgb] 我 的 过 犯 被 你 封 在 囊 中 ， 也 缝 严 了 我 的 罪 孽 。 [kjv] My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity. [bbe] My wrongdoing is corded up in a bag, and my sin is shut up safe. 14:18 [hgb] 山 崩 变 为 无 有 。 磐 石 挪 开 原 处 。 [kjv] And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place. [bbe] But truly a mountain falling comes to dust, and a rock is moved from its place; 14:19 [hgb] 水 流 消 磨 石 头 ， 所 流 溢 的 洗 去 地 上 的 尘 土 。 你 也 照 样 灭 绝 人 的 指 望 。 [kjv] The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man. [bbe] The stones are crushed small by the force of the waters; the dust of the earth is washed away by their overflowing: and so you put an end to the hope of man. 14:20 [hgb] 你 攻 击 人 常 常 得 胜 ， 使 他 去 世 。 你 改 变 他 的 容 貌 ， 叫 他 往 而 不 回 。 [kjv] Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away. [bbe] You overcome him for ever, and he is gone; his face is changed in death, and you send him away. 14:21 [hgb] 他 儿 子 得 尊 荣 ， 他 也 不 知 道 。 降 为 卑 ， 他 也 不 觉 得 。 [kjv] His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them. [bbe] His sons come to honour, and he has no knowledge of it; they are made low, but he is not conscious of it. 14:22 [hgb] 但 知 身 上 疼 痛 ， 心 中 悲 哀 。 [kjv] But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn. [bbe] Only his flesh still has pain, and his soul is sad.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114/1617.html","bookId":183,"book":{"id":183,"title":"约伯记 Job","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 乌 斯 地 有 一 个 人 名 叫 约 伯 。 那 人 完 全 正 直 ， 敬 畏 神 ， 远 离 恶 事 。 [kjv] There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared G...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
