[bbe] And now, O Job, give ear to my words, and take note of all I say. 33:2 [hgb] 我 现 在 开 口 ， 用 舌 发 言 。 [kjv] Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth. [bbe] See, now my mouth is open, my tongue gives out words. 33:3 [hgb] 我 的 言 语 要 发 明 心 中 所 存 的 正 直 。 我 所 知 道 的 ， 我 嘴 唇 要 诚 实 地 说 出 。 [kjv] My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly. [bbe] My heart is overflowing with knowledge, my lips say what is true. 33:4 [hgb] 神 的 灵 造 我 ， 全 能 者 的 气 使 我 得 生 。 [kjv] The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life. [bbe] The spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Ruler of all gives me life. 33:5 [hgb] 你 若 回 答 我 ， 就 站 起 来 ， 在 我 面 前 陈 明 。 [kjv] If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up. [bbe] If you are able, give me an answer; put your cause in order, and come forward. 33:6 [hgb] 我 在 神 面 前 与 你 一 样 ， 也 是 用 土 造 成 。 [kjv] Behold, I am according to thy wish in God\u0027s stead: I also am formed out of the clay. [bbe] See, I am the same as you are in the eyes of God; I was cut off from the same bit of wet earth. 33:7 [hgb] 我 不 用 威 严 惊 吓 你 ， 也 不 用 势 力 重 压 你 。 [kjv] Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee. [bbe] Fear of me will not overcome you, and my hand will not be hard on you. 33:8 [hgb] 你 所 说 的 ， 我 听 见 了 ， 也 听 见 你 的 言 语 ， 说 ， [kjv] Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying, [bbe] But you said in my hearing, and your voice came to my ears: 33:9 [hgb] 我 是 清 洁 无 过 的 ， 我 是 无 辜 的 。 在 我 里 面 也 没 有 罪 孽 。 [kjv] I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me. [bbe] I am clean, without sin; I am washed, and there is no evil in me: 33:10 [hgb] 神 找 机 会 攻 击 我 ， 以 我 为 仇 敌 ， [kjv] Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy, [bbe] See, he is looking for something against me; in his eyes I am as one of his haters; 33:11 [hgb] 把 我 的 脚 上 了 木 狗 ， 窥 察 我 一 切 的 道 路 。 [kjv] He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths. [bbe] He puts chains on my feet; he is watching all my ways. 33:12 [hgb] 我 要 回 答 你 说 ， 你 这 话 无 理 ， 因 神 比 世 人 更 大 。 [kjv] Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man. [bbe] Truly, in saying this you are wrong; for God is greater than man. 33:13 [hgb] 你 为 何 与 他 争 论 呢 ？ 因 他 的 事 都 不 对 人 解 说 。 [kjv] Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters. [bbe] Why do you put forward your cause against him, saying, He gives no answer to any of my words? 33:14 [hgb] 神 说 一 次 ， 两 次 ， 世 人 却 不 理 会 。 [kjv] For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not. [bbe] For God gives his word in one way, even in two, and man is not conscious of it: 33:15 [hgb] 人 躺 在 床 上 沉 睡 的 时 候 ， 神 就 用 梦 ， 和 夜 间 的 异 象 ， [kjv] In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed; [bbe] In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep comes on men, while they take their rest on their beds; 33:16 [hgb] 开 通 他 们 的 耳 朵 ， 将 当 受 的 教 训 印 在 他 们 心 上 ， [kjv] Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction, [bbe] Then he makes his secrets clear to men, so that they are full of fear at what they see; 33:17 [hgb] 好 叫 人 不 从 自 己 的 谋 算 ， 不 行 骄 傲 的 事 。 （ 原 文 作 将 骄 傲 向 人 隐 藏 ） [kjv] That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man. [bbe] In order that man may be turned from his evil works, and that pride may be taken away from him; 33:18 [hgb] 拦 阻 人 不 陷 于 坑 里 ， 不 死 在 刀 下 。 [kjv] He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword. [bbe] To keep back his soul from the underworld, and his life from destruction. 33:19 [hgb] 人 在 床 上 被 惩 治 ， 骨 头 中 不 住 地 疼 痛 。 [kjv] He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain: [bbe] Pain is sent on him as a punishment, while he is on his bed; there is no end to the trouble in his bones; 33:20 [hgb] 以 致 他 的 口 厌 弃 食 物 ， 心 厌 恶 美 味 。 [kjv] So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat. [bbe] He has no desire for food, and his soul is turned away from delicate meat; 33:21 [hgb] 他 的 肉 消 瘦 ， 不 得 再 见 。 先 前 不 见 的 骨 头 都 凸 出 来 。 [kjv] His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out. [bbe] His flesh is so wasted away, that it may not be seen, and his bones. ... 33:22 [hgb] 他 的 灵 魂 临 近 深 坑 。 他 的 生 命 近 于 灭 命 的 。 [kjv] Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers. [bbe] And his soul comes near to the underworld, and his life to the angels of death. 33:23 [hgb] 一 千 天 使 中 ， 若 有 一 个 作 传 话 的 与 神 同 在 ， 指 示 人 所 当 行 的 事 。 [kjv] If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness: [bbe] If now there may be an angel sent to him, one of the thousands which there are to be between him and God, and to make clear to man what is right for him; 33:24 [hgb] 神 就 给 他 开 恩 ， 说 ， 救 赎 他 免 得 下 坑 。 我 已 经 得 了 赎 价 。 [kjv] Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom. [bbe] And if he has mercy on him, and says, Let him not go down to the underworld, I have given the price for his life: 33:25 [hgb] 他 的 肉 要 比 孩 童 的 肉 更 嫩 。 他 就 返 老 还 童 。 [kjv] His flesh shall be fresher than a child\u0027s: he shall return to the days of his youth: [bbe] Then his flesh becomes young again, and he comes back to the days of his early strength; 33:26 [hgb] 他 祷 告 神 ， 神 就 喜 悦 他 ， 使 他 欢 呼 朝 见 神 的 面 。 神 又 看 他 为 义 。 [kjv] He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness. [bbe] He makes his prayer to God, and he has mercy on him; he sees God\u0027s face with cries of joy; he gives news of his righteousness to men; 33:27 [hgb] 他 在 人 前 歌 唱 说 ， 我 犯 了 罪 ， 颠 倒 是 非 ， 这 竟 与 我 无 益 。 [kjv] He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not; [bbe] He makes a song, saying, I did wrong, turning from the straight way, but he did not give me the reward of my sin. 33:28 [hgb] 神 救 赎 我 的 灵 魂 免 入 深 坑 。 我 的 生 命 也 必 见 光 。 [kjv] He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light. [bbe] He kept my soul from the underworld, and my life sees the light in full measure. 33:29 [hgb] 神 两 次 ， 三 次 ， 向 人 行 这 一 切 的 事 。 [kjv] Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man, [bbe] Truly, God does all these things to man, twice and three times, 33:30 [hgb] 为 要 从 深 坑 救 回 人 的 灵 魂 ， 使 他 被 光 照 耀 与 活 人 一 样 。 [kjv] To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living. [bbe] Keeping back his soul from the underworld, so that he may see the light of life. 33:31 [hgb] 约 伯 阿 ， 你 当 侧 耳 听 我 的 话 ， 不 要 作 声 ， 等 我 讲 说 。 [kjv] Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak. [bbe] Take note O Job, give ear to me; keep quiet, while I say what is in my mind. 33:32 [hgb] 你 若 有 话 说 ， 就 可 以 回 答 我 。 你 只 管 说 ， 因 我 愿 以 你 为 是 。 [kjv] If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee. [bbe] If you have anything to say, give me an answer; for it is my desire that you may be judged free from sin. 33:33 [hgb] 若 不 然 ， 你 就 听 我 说 。 你 不 要 作 声 ， 我 便 将 智 慧 教 训 你 。 [kjv] If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom. [bbe] If not, give attention to me, and keep quiet, and I will give you wisdom.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114/1636.html","bookId":183,"book":{"id":183,"title":"约伯记 Job","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 乌 斯 地 有 一 个 人 名 叫 约 伯 。 那 人 完 全 正 直 ， 敬 畏 神 ， 远 离 恶 事 。 [kjv] There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared G...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
