\n [bbe] Have you knowledge of God\u0027s ordering of his works, how he makes the light of his cloud to be seen? \n 37:16 [hgb] 云 彩 如 何 浮 于 空 中 ， 那 知 识 全 备 者 奇 妙 的 作 为 ， 你 知 道 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge? \n [bbe] Have you knowledge of the balancings of the clouds, the wonders of him who has all wisdom? \n 37:17 [hgb] 南 风 使 地 寂 静 ， 你 的 衣 服 就 如 火 热 ， 你 知 道 吗 ？ \n [kjv] How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind? \n [bbe] You, whose clothing is warm, when the earth is quiet because of the south wind, \n 37:18 [hgb] 你 岂 能 与 神 同 铺 穹 苍 吗 ？ 这 穹 苍 坚 硬 ， 如 同 铸 成 的 镜 子 。 \n [kjv] Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass? \n [bbe] Will you, with him, make the skies smooth, and strong as a polished looking-glass? \n 37:19 [hgb] 我 们 愚 昧 不 能 陈 说 。 请 你 指 教 我 们 该 对 他 说 什 么 话 。 \n [kjv] Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness. \n [bbe] Make clear to me what we are to say to him; we are unable to put our cause before him, because of the dark. \n 37:20 [hgb] 人 岂 可 说 ， 我 愿 与 他 说 话 。 岂 有 人 自 愿 灭 亡 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up. \n [bbe] How may he have knowledge of my desire for talk with him? or did any man ever say, May destruction come on me? \n 37:21 [hgb] 现 在 有 云 遮 蔽 ， 人 不 得 见 穹 苍 的 光 亮 。 但 风 吹 过 ， 天 又 发 晴 。 \n [kjv] And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them. \n [bbe] And now the light is not seen, for it is dark because of the clouds; but a wind comes, clearing them away. \n 37:22 [hgb] 金 光 出 于 北 方 ， 在 神 那 里 有 可 怕 的 威 严 。 \n [kjv] Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty. \n [bbe] A bright light comes out of the north; God\u0027s glory is greatly to be feared. \n 37:23 [hgb] 论 到 全 能 者 ， 我 们 不 能 测 度 。 他 大 有 能 力 ， 有 公 平 和 大 义 ， 必 不 苦 待 人 。 \n [kjv] Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict. \n [bbe] There is no searching out of the Ruler of all: his strength and his judging are great; he is full of righteousness, doing no wrong. \n 37:24 [hgb] 所 以 ， 人 敬 畏 他 。 凡 自 以 为 心 中 有 智 慧 的 人 ， 他 都 不 顾 念 。 \n [kjv] Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart. \n [bbe] For this cause men go in fear of him; he has no respect for any who are wise in heart. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114/1640.html","bookId":183,"book":{"id":183,"title":"约伯记 Job","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 乌 斯 地 有 一 个 人 名 叫 约 伯 。 那 人 完 全 正 直 ， 敬 畏 神 ， 远 离 恶 事 。 [kjv] There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared G...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
