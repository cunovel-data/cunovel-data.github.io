{"id":5713,"no":15,"title":"Chapter 15","content":"15:1 [hgb] 提 幔 人 以 利 法 回 答 说 ， [kjv] Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, [bbe] And Eliphaz the Temanite made answer and said, 15:2 [hgb] 智 慧 人 岂 可 用 虚 空 的 知 识 回 答 ， 用 东 风 充 满 肚 腹 呢 ？ [kjv] Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind? [bbe] Will a wise man make answer with knowledge of no value, or will he give birth to the east wind? 15:3 [hgb] 他 岂 可 用 无 益 的 话 ， 和 无 济 于 事 的 言 语 ， 理 论 呢 ？ [kjv] Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good? [bbe] Will he make arguments with words in which is no profit, and with sayings which have no value? 15:4 [hgb] 你 是 废 弃 敬 畏 的 意 ， 在 神 面 前 阻 止 敬 虔 的 心 。 [kjv] Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God. [bbe] Truly, you make the fear of God without effect, so that the time of quiet worship before God is made less by your outcry. 15:5 [hgb] 你 的 罪 孽 指 教 你 的 口 。 你 选 用 诡 诈 人 的 舌 头 。 [kjv] For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty. [bbe] For your mouth is guided by your sin, and you have taken the tongue of the false for yourself. 15:6 [hgb] 你 自 己 的 口 定 你 有 罪 ， 并 非 是 我 。 你 自 己 的 嘴 ， 见 证 你 的 不 是 。 [kjv] Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee. [bbe] It is by your mouth, even yours, that you are judged to be in the wrong, and not by me; and your lips give witness against you. 15:7 [hgb] 你 岂 是 头 一 个 被 生 的 人 吗 ？ 你 受 造 在 诸 山 之 先 吗 ？ [kjv] Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills? [bbe] Were you the first man to come into the world? or did you come into being before the hills? 15:8 [hgb] 你 曾 听 见 神 的 密 旨 吗 ？ 你 还 将 智 慧 独 自 得 尽 吗 ？ [kjv] Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself? [bbe] Were you present at the secret meeting of God? and have you taken all wisdom for yourself? 15:9 [hgb] 你 知 道 什 么 是 我 们 不 知 道 的 呢 ？ 你 明 白 什 么 是 我 们 不 明 白 的 呢 ？ [kjv] What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us? [bbe] What knowledge have you which we have not? is there anything in your mind which is not in ours? 15:10 [hgb] 我 们 这 里 有 白 发 的 ， 和 年 纪 老 迈 的 ， 比 你 父 亲 还 老 。 [kjv] With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father. [bbe] With us are men who are grey-haired and full of years, much older than your father. 15:11 [hgb] 神 用 温 和 的 话 安 慰 你 ， 你 以 为 太 小 吗 ？ [kjv] Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee? [bbe] Are the comforts of God not enough for you, and the gentle word which was said to you? 15:12 [hgb] 你 的 心 为 何 将 你 逼 去 。 你 的 眼 为 何 冒 出 火 星 。 [kjv] Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at, [bbe] Why is your heart uncontrolled, and why are your eyes lifted up; 15:13 [hgb] 使 你 的 灵 反 对 神 ， 也 任 你 的 口 发 这 言 语 。 [kjv] That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth? [bbe] So that you are turning your spirit against God, and letting such words go out of your mouth? 15:14 [hgb] 人 是 什 么 ， 竟 算 为 洁 净 呢 ？ 妇 人 所 生 的 是 什 么 ， 竟 算 为 义 呢 ？ [kjv] What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous? [bbe] What is man, that he may be clean? and how may the son of woman be upright? 15:15 [hgb] 神 不 信 靠 他 的 众 圣 者 。 在 他 眼 前 ， 天 也 不 洁 净 。 [kjv] Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight. [bbe] Truly, he puts no faith in his holy ones, and the heavens are not clean in his eyes; 15:16 [hgb] 何 况 那 污 秽 可 憎 ， 喝 罪 孽 如 水 的 世 人 呢 ？ [kjv] How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water? [bbe] How much less one who is disgusting and unclean, a man who takes in evil like water! 15:17 [hgb] 我 指 示 你 ， 你 要 听 。 我 要 述 说 所 看 见 的 。 [kjv] I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare; [bbe] Take note and give ear to my words; and I will say what I have seen: 15:18 [hgb] 就 是 智 慧 人 从 列 祖 所 受 ， 传 说 而 不 隐 瞒 的 。 [kjv] Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it: [bbe] (The things which wise men have got from their fathers, and have not kept secret from us; 15:19 [hgb] （ 这 地 惟 独 赐 给 他 们 ， 并 没 有 外 人 从 他 们 中 间 经 过 ） 。 [kjv] Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them. [bbe] For only to them was the land given, and no strange people were among them:) 15:20 [hgb] 恶 人 一 生 之 日 劬 劳 痛 苦 ， 强 暴 人 一 生 的 年 数 也 是 如 此 。 [kjv] The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor. [bbe] The evil man is in pain all his days, and the number of the years stored up for the cruel is small. 15:21 [hgb] 惊 吓 的 声 音 常 在 他 耳 中 。 在 平 安 时 ， 抢 夺 的 必 临 到 他 那 里 。 [kjv] A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him. [bbe] A sound of fear is in his ears; in time of peace destruction will come on him: 15:22 [hgb] 他 不 信 自 己 能 从 黑 暗 中 转 回 ， 他 被 刀 剑 等 候 。 [kjv] He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword. [bbe] He has no hope of coming safe out of the dark, and his fate will be the sword; 15:23 [hgb] 他 漂 流 在 外 求 食 ， 说 ， 哪 里 有 食 物 呢 ？ 他 知 道 黑 暗 的 日 子 ， 在 他 手 边 预 备 好 了 。 [kjv] He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand. [bbe] He is wandering about in search of bread, saying, Where is it? and he is certain that the day of trouble is ready for him: 15:24 [hgb] 急 难 困 苦 叫 他 害 怕 ， 而 且 胜 了 他 ， 好 像 君 王 预 备 上 阵 一 样 。 [kjv] Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle. [bbe] He is greatly in fear of the dark day, trouble and pain overcome him: 15:25 [hgb] 他 伸 手 攻 击 神 ， 以 骄 傲 攻 击 全 能 者 。 [kjv] For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty. [bbe] Because his hand is stretched out against God, and his heart is lifted up against the Ruler of all, 15:26 [hgb] 挺 着 颈 项 ， 用 盾 牌 的 厚 凸 面 ， 向 全 能 者 直 闯 。 [kjv] He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers: [bbe] Running against him like a man of war, covered by his thick breastplate; even like a king ready for the fight, 15:27 [hgb] 是 因 他 的 脸 蒙 上 脂 油 ， 腰 积 成 肥 肉 。 [kjv] Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on his flanks. [bbe] Because his face is covered with fat, and his body has become thick; 15:28 [hgb] 他 曾 住 在 荒 凉 城 邑 ， 无 人 居 住 ， 将 成 乱 堆 的 房 屋 。 [kjv] And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps. [bbe] And he has made his resting-place in the towns which have been pulled down, in houses where no man had a right to be, whose fate was to become masses of broken walls. 15:29 [hgb] 他 不 得 富 足 ， 财 物 不 得 常 存 ， 产 业 在 地 上 也 不 加 增 。 [kjv] He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth. [bbe] He does not get wealth for himself, and is unable to keep what he has got; the heads of his grain are not bent down to the earth. 15:30 [hgb] 他 不 得 出 离 黑 暗 。 火 焰 要 将 他 的 枝 子 烧 干 。 因 神 口 中 的 气 ， 他 要 灭 亡 （ 灭 亡 原 文 作 走 去 ） 。 [kjv] He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away. [bbe] He does not come out of the dark; his branches are burned by the flame, and the wind takes away his bud. 15:31 [hgb] 他 不 用 倚 靠 虚 假 欺 哄 自 己 ， 因 虚 假 必 成 为 他 的 报 应 。 [kjv] Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence. [bbe] Let him not put his hope in what is false, falling into error: for he will get deceit as his reward. 15:32 [hgb] 他 的 日 期 未 到 之 先 ， 这 事 必 成 就 。 他 的 枝 子 不 得 青 绿 。 [kjv] It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green. [bbe] His branch is cut off before its time, and his leaf is no longer green. 15:33 [hgb] 他 必 像 葡 萄 树 的 葡 萄 ， 未 熟 而 落 。 又 像 橄 榄 树 的 花 ， 一 开 而 谢 。 [kjv] He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive. [bbe] He is like a vine whose grapes do not come to full growth, or an olive-tree dropping its flowers. 15:34 [hgb] 原 来 不 敬 虔 之 辈 必 无 生 育 。 受 贿 赂 之 人 的 帐 棚 必 被 火 烧 。 [kjv] For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery. [bbe] For the band of the evil-doers gives no fruit, and the tents of those who give wrong decisions for reward are burned with fire. 15:35 [hgb] 他 们 所 怀 的 是 毒 害 ， 所 生 的 是 罪 孽 ， 心 里 所 预 备 的 是 诡 诈 。 [kjv] They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit. [bbe] Evil has made them with child, and they give birth to trouble; and the fruit of their body is shame for themselves.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114/1618.html","bookId":183,"book":{"id":183,"title":"约伯记 Job","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 乌 斯 地 有 一 个 人 名 叫 约 伯 。 那 人 完 全 正 直 ， 敬 畏 神 ， 远 离 恶 事 。 [kjv] There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared G...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
