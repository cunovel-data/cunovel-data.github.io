{"id":5715,"no":17,"title":"Chapter 17","content":"17:1 [hgb] 我 的 心 灵 消 耗 ， 我 的 日 子 灭 尽 。 坟 墓 为 我 预 备 好 了 。 \n [kjv] My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me. \n [bbe] My spirit is broken, my days are ended, the last resting-place is ready for me. \n 17:2 [hgb] 真 有 戏 笑 我 的 在 我 这 里 ， 我 眼 常 见 他 们 惹 动 我 。 \n [kjv] Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation? \n [bbe] Truly, those who make sport of me are round about me, and my eyes become dark because of their bitter laughing. \n 17:3 [hgb] 愿 主 拿 凭 据 给 我 ， 自 己 为 我 作 保 。 在 你 以 外 谁 肯 与 我 击 掌 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me? \n [bbe] Be pleased, now, to be responsible for me to yourself; for there is no other who will put his hand in mine. \n 17:4 [hgb] 因 你 使 他 们 心 不 明 理 ， 所 以 你 必 不 高 举 他 们 。 \n [kjv] For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them. \n [bbe] You have kept their hearts from wisdom: for this cause you will not give them honour. \n 17:5 [hgb] 控 告 他 的 朋 友 ， 以 朋 友 为 可 抢 夺 的 ， 连 他 儿 女 的 眼 睛 也 要 失 明 。 \n [kjv] He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail. \n [bbe] As for him who is false to his friend for a reward, light will be cut off from the eyes of his children. \n 17:6 [hgb] 神 使 我 作 了 民 中 的 笑 谈 。 他 们 也 吐 唾 沫 在 我 脸 上 。 \n [kjv] He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret. \n [bbe] He has made me a word of shame to the peoples; I have become a mark for their sport. \n 17:7 [hgb] 我 的 眼 睛 因 忧 愁 昏 花 。 我 的 百 体 好 像 影 儿 。 \n [kjv] Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow. \n [bbe] My eyes have become dark because of my pain, and all my body is wasted to a shade. \n 17:8 [hgb] 正 直 人 因 此 必 惊 奇 。 无 辜 的 人 ， 要 兴 起 攻 击 不 敬 虔 之 辈 。 \n [kjv] Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite. \n [bbe] The upright are surprised at this, and he who has done no wrong is troubled because of the evil-doers. \n 17:9 [hgb] 然 而 ， 义 人 要 持 守 所 行 的 道 。 手 洁 的 人 要 力 上 加 力 。 \n [kjv] The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger. \n [bbe] Still the upright keeps on his way, and he who has clean hands gets new strength. \n 17:10 [hgb] 至 于 你 们 众 人 ， 可 以 再 来 辩 论 吧 。 你 们 中 间 ， 我 找 不 着 一 个 智 慧 人 。 \n [kjv] But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you. \n [bbe] But come back, now, all of you, come; and I will not see a wise man among you. \n 17:11 [hgb] 我 的 日 子 已 经 过 了 。 我 的 谋 算 ， 我 心 所 想 望 的 已 经 断 绝 。 \n [kjv] My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart. \n [bbe] My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the desires of my heart. \n 17:12 [hgb] 他 们 以 黑 夜 为 白 昼 ， 说 ， 亮 光 近 乎 黑 暗 。 \n [kjv] They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness. \n [bbe] They are changing night into day; they say, The light is near the dark. \n 17:13 [hgb] 我 若 盼 望 阴 间 为 我 的 房 屋 ， 若 下 榻 在 黑 暗 中 ， \n [kjv] If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness. \n [bbe] If I am waiting for the underworld as my house, if I have made my bed in the dark; \n 17:14 [hgb] 若 对 朽 坏 说 ， 你 是 我 的 父 。 对 虫 说 ， 你 是 我 的 母 亲 姐 妹 。 \n [kjv] I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister. \n [bbe] If I say to the earth, You are my father; and to the worm, My mother and my sister; \n 17:15 [hgb] 这 样 ， 我 的 指 望 在 哪 里 呢 ？ 我 所 指 望 的 谁 能 看 见 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it? \n [bbe] Where then is my hope? and who will see my desire? \n 17:16 [hgb] 等 到 安 息 在 尘 土 中 ， 这 指 望 必 下 到 阴 间 的 门 闩 那 里 了 。 \n [kjv] They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust. \n [bbe] Will they go down with me into the underworld? Will we go down together into the dust? \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114/1620.html","bookId":183,"book":{"id":183,"title":"约伯记 Job","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 乌 斯 地 有 一 个 人 名 叫 约 伯 。 那 人 完 全 正 直 ， 敬 畏 神 ， 远 离 恶 事 。 [kjv] There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared G...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
