{"id":5738,"no":40,"title":"Chapter 40","content":"40:1 [hgb] 耶 和 华 又 对 约 伯 说 ， \\n\\n [kjv] Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said, \\n\\n [bbe] ... \\n\\n 40:2 [hgb] 强 辩 的 岂 可 与 全 能 者 争 论 吗 ？ 与 神 辩 驳 的 可 以 回 答 这 些 吧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it. \\n\\n [bbe] Will he who is protesting give teaching to the Ruler of all? Let him who has arguments to put forward against God give an answer. \\n\\n 40:3 [hgb] 于 是 ， 约 伯 回 答 耶 和 华 说 ， \\n\\n [kjv] Then Job answered the LORD, and said, \\n\\n [bbe] And Job said in answer to the Lord, \\n\\n 40:4 [hgb] 我 是 卑 贱 的 。 我 用 什 么 回 答 你 呢 ？ 只 好 用 手 捂 口 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth. \\n\\n [bbe] Truly, I am of no value; what answer may I give to you? I will put my hand on my mouth. \\n\\n 40:5 [hgb] 我 说 了 一 次 ， 再 不 回 答 。 说 了 两 次 ， 就 不 再 说 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further. \\n\\n [bbe] I have said once, and even twice, what was in my mind, but I will not do so again. \\n\\n 40:6 [hgb] 于 是 ， 耶 和 华 从 旋 风 中 回 答 约 伯 说 ， \\n\\n [kjv] Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said, \\n\\n [bbe] Then the Lord made answer to Job out of the storm-wind, and said, \\n\\n 40:7 [hgb] 你 要 如 勇 士 束 腰 。 我 问 你 ， 你 可 以 指 示 我 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. \\n\\n [bbe] Get your strength together like a man of war: I will put questions to you, and you will give me the answers. \\n\\n 40:8 [hgb] 你 岂 可 废 弃 我 所 拟 定 的 。 岂 可 定 我 有 罪 ， 好 显 自 己 为 义 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous? \\n\\n [bbe] Will you even make my right of no value? will you say that I am wrong in order to make clear that you are right? \\n\\n 40:9 [hgb] 你 有 神 那 样 的 膀 臂 吗 ？ 你 能 像 他 发 雷 声 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him? \\n\\n [bbe] Have you an arm like God? have you a voice of thunder like his? \\n\\n 40:10 [hgb] 你 要 以 荣 耀 庄 严 为 妆 饰 ， 以 尊 荣 威 严 为 衣 服 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty. \\n\\n [bbe] Put on the ornaments of your pride; be clothed with glory and power: \\n\\n 40:11 [hgb] 要 发 出 你 满 溢 的 怒 气 ， 见 一 切 骄 傲 的 人 ， 使 他 降 卑 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him. \\n\\n [bbe] Let your wrath be overflowing; let your eyes see all the sons of pride, and make them low. \\n\\n 40:12 [hgb] 见 一 切 骄 傲 的 人 ， 将 他 制 伏 ， 把 恶 人 践 踏 在 本 处 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place. \\n\\n [bbe] Send destruction on all who are lifted up, pulling down the sinners from their places. \\n\\n 40:13 [hgb] 将 他 们 一 同 隐 藏 在 尘 土 中 ， 把 他 们 的 脸 蒙 蔽 在 隐 密 处 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret. \\n\\n [bbe] Let them be covered together in the dust; let their faces be dark in the secret place of the underworld. \\n\\n 40:14 [hgb] 我 就 认 你 右 手 能 以 救 自 己 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee. \\n\\n [bbe] Then I will give praise to you, saying that your right hand is able to give you salvation. \\n\\n 40:15 [hgb] 你 且 观 看 河 马 。 我 造 你 也 造 它 。 它 吃 草 与 牛 一 样 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox. \\n\\n [bbe] See now the Great Beast, whom I made, even as I made you; he takes grass for food, like the ox. \\n\\n 40:16 [hgb] 它 的 气 力 在 腰 间 ， 能 力 在 肚 腹 的 筋 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly. \\n\\n [bbe] His strength is in his body, and his force in the muscles of his stomach. \\n\\n 40:17 [hgb] 它 摇 动 尾 巴 如 香 柏 树 。 它 大 腿 的 筋 互 相 联 络 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together. \\n\\n [bbe] His tail is curving like a cedar; the muscles of his legs are joined together. \\n\\n 40:18 [hgb] 它 的 骨 头 好 像 铜 管 。 它 的 肢 体 仿 佛 铁 棍 。 \\n\\n [kjv] His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron. \\n\\n [bbe] His bones are pipes of brass, his legs are like rods of iron. \\n\\n 40:19 [hgb] 它 在 神 所 造 的 物 中 为 首 。 创 造 它 的 给 它 刀 剑 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him. \\n\\n [bbe] He is the chief of the ways of God, made by him for his pleasure. \\n\\n 40:20 [hgb] 诸 山 给 它 出 食 物 ， 也 是 百 兽 游 玩 之 处 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play. \\n\\n [bbe] He takes the produce of the mountains, where all the beasts of the field are at play. \\n\\n 40:21 [hgb] 它 伏 在 莲 叶 之 下 ， 卧 在 芦 苇 隐 密 处 和 水 洼 子 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens. \\n\\n [bbe] He takes his rest under the trees of the river, and in the pool, under the shade of the water-plants. \\n\\n 40:22 [hgb] 莲 叶 的 阴 凉 遮 蔽 它 。 溪 旁 的 柳 树 环 绕 它 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about. \\n\\n [bbe] He is covered by the branches of the trees; the grasses of the stream are round him. \\n\\n 40:23 [hgb] 河 水 泛 滥 ， 它 不 发 战 。 就 是 约 旦 河 的 水 涨 到 它 口 边 ， 也 是 安 然 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth. \\n\\n [bbe] Truly, if the river is overflowing, it gives him no cause for fear; he has no sense of danger, even if Jordan is rushing against his mouth. \\n\\n 40:24 [hgb] 在 它 防 备 的 时 候 ， 谁 能 捉 拿 它 ？ 谁 能 牢 笼 它 穿 它 的 鼻 子 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares. \\n\\n [bbe] Will anyone take him when he is on the watch, or put metal teeth through his nose?
