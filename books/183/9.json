{"id":5707,"no":9,"title":"Chapter 9","content":"9:1 [hgb] 约 伯 回 答 说 ， \\n\\n [kjv] Then Job answered and said, \\n\\n [bbe] And Job made answer and said, \\n\\n 9:2 [hgb] 我 真 知 道 是 这 样 。 但 人 在 神 面 前 怎 能 成 为 义 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God? \\n\\n [bbe] Truly, I see that it is so: and how is it possible for a man to get his right before God? \\n\\n 9:3 [hgb] 若 愿 意 与 他 争 辩 ， 千 中 之 一 也 不 能 回 答 。 \\n\\n [kjv] If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand. \\n\\n [bbe] If a man was desiring to go to law with him, he would not be able to give him an answer to one out of a thousand questions. \\n\\n 9:4 [hgb] 他 心 里 有 智 慧 ， 且 大 有 能 力 。 谁 向 神 刚 硬 而 得 亨 通 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered? \\n\\n [bbe] He is wise in heart and great in strength: who ever made his face hard against him, and any good came of it? \\n\\n 9:5 [hgb] 他 发 怒 ， 把 山 翻 倒 挪 移 ， 山 并 不 知 觉 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger. \\n\\n [bbe] It is he who takes away the mountains without their knowledge, overturning them in his wrath: \\n\\n 9:6 [hgb] 他 使 地 震 动 ， 离 其 本 位 ， 地 的 柱 子 就 摇 撼 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble. \\n\\n [bbe] Who is moving the earth out of its place, so that its pillars are shaking: \\n\\n 9:7 [hgb] 他 吩 咐 日 头 不 出 来 ， 就 不 出 来 ， 又 封 闭 众 星 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars. \\n\\n [bbe] Who gives orders to the sun, and it does not give its light; and who keeps the stars from shining. \\n\\n 9:8 [hgb] 他 独 自 铺 张 苍 天 ， 步 行 在 海 浪 之 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea. \\n\\n [bbe] By whose hand the heavens were stretched out, and who is walking on the waves of the sea: \\n\\n 9:9 [hgb] 他 造 北 斗 ， 参 星 ， 昴 星 ， 并 南 方 的 密 宫 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south. \\n\\n [bbe] Who made the Bear and Orion, and the Pleiades, and the store-houses of the south: \\n\\n 9:10 [hgb] 他 行 大 事 ， 不 可 测 度 ， 行 奇 事 ， 不 可 胜 数 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number. \\n\\n [bbe] Who does great things not to be searched out; yes, wonders without number. \\n\\n 9:11 [hgb] 他 从 我 旁 边 经 过 ， 我 却 不 看 见 。 他 在 我 面 前 行 走 ， 我 倒 不 知 觉 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not. \\n\\n [bbe] See, he goes past me and I see him not: he goes on before, but I have no knowledge of him. \\n\\n 9:12 [hgb] 他 夺 取 ， 谁 能 阻 挡 。 谁 敢 问 他 ， 你 做 什 么 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou? \\n\\n [bbe] If he puts out his hand to take, by whom may it be turned back? who may say to him, What are you doing? \\n\\n 9:13 [hgb] 神 必 不 收 回 他 的 怒 气 。 扶 助 拉 哈 伯 的 ， 屈 身 在 他 以 下 。 \\n\\n [kjv] If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him. \\n\\n [bbe] God\u0027s wrath may not be turned back; the helpers of Rahab were bent down under him. \\n\\n 9:14 [hgb] 既 是 这 样 ， 我 怎 敢 回 答 他 ， 怎 敢 选 择 言 语 与 他 辩 论 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him? \\n\\n [bbe] How much less may I give an answer to him, using the right words in argument with him? \\n\\n 9:15 [hgb] 我 虽 有 义 ， 也 不 回 答 他 。 只 要 向 那 审 判 我 的 恳 求 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge. \\n\\n [bbe] Even if my cause was good, I would not be able to give an answer; I would make request for grace from him who was against me. \\n\\n 9:16 [hgb] 我 若 呼 吁 ， 他 应 允 我 。 我 仍 不 信 他 真 听 我 的 声 音 。 \\n\\n [kjv] If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice. \\n\\n [bbe] If I had sent for him to be present, and he had come, I would have no faith that he would give ear to my voice. \\n\\n 9:17 [hgb] 他 用 暴 风 折 断 我 ， 无 故 地 加 增 我 的 损 伤 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause. \\n\\n [bbe] For I would be crushed by his storm, my wounds would be increased without cause. \\n\\n 9:18 [hgb] 我 就 是 喘 一 口 气 ， 他 都 不 容 ， 倒 使 我 满 心 苦 恼 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness. \\n\\n [bbe] He would not let me take my breath, but I would be full of bitter grief. \\n\\n 9:19 [hgb] 若 论 力 量 ， 他 真 有 能 力 。 若 论 审 判 ， 他 说 谁 能 将 我 传 来 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead? \\n\\n [bbe] If it is a question of strength, he says, Here I am! and if it is a question of a cause at law, he says, Who will give me a fixed day? \\n\\n 9:20 [hgb] 我 虽 有 义 ， 自 己 的 口 要 定 我 为 有 罪 。 我 虽 完 全 ， 我 口 必 显 我 为 弯 曲 。 \\n\\n [kjv] If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse. \\n\\n [bbe] Though I was in the right, he would say that I was in the wrong; I have done no evil; but he says that I am a sinner. \\n\\n 9:21 [hgb] 我 本 完 全 ， 不 顾 自 己 。 我 厌 恶 我 的 性 命 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life. \\n\\n [bbe] I have done no wrong; I give no thought to what becomes of me; I have no desire for life. \\n\\n 9:22 [hgb] 善 恶 无 分 ， 都 是 一 样 。 所 以 我 说 ， 完 全 人 和 恶 人 ， 他 都 灭 绝 。 \\n\\n [kjv] This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. \\n\\n [bbe] It is all the same to me; so I say, He puts an end to the sinner and to him who has done no wrong together. \\n\\n 9:23 [hgb] 若 忽 然 遭 杀 害 之 祸 ， 他 必 戏 笑 无 辜 的 人 遇 难 。 \\n\\n [kjv] If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent. \\n\\n [bbe] If death comes suddenly through disease, he makes sport of the fate of those who have done no wrong. \\n\\n 9:24 [hgb] 世 界 交 在 恶 人 手 中 。 蒙 蔽 世 界 审 判 官 的 脸 ， 若 不 是 他 ， 是 谁 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he? \\n\\n [bbe] The land is given into the power of the evil-doer; the faces of its judges are covered; if not by him, then who has done it? \\n\\n 9:25 [hgb] 我 的 日 子 比 跑 信 的 更 快 ， 急 速 过 去 ， 不 见 福 乐 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good. \\n\\n [bbe] My days go quicker than a post-runner: they go in flight, they see no good. \\n\\n 9:26 [hgb] 我 的 日 子 过 去 如 快 船 ， 如 急 落 抓 食 的 鹰 。 \\n\\n [kjv] They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey. \\n\\n [bbe] They go rushing on like reed-boats, like an eagle dropping suddenly on its food. \\n\\n 9:27 [hgb] 我 若 说 ， 我 要 忘 记 我 的 哀 情 ， 除 去 我 的 愁 容 ， 心 中 畅 快 。 \\n\\n [kjv] If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself: \\n\\n [bbe] If I say, I will put my grief out of mind, I will let my face be sad no longer and I will be bright; \\n\\n 9:28 [hgb] 我 因 愁 苦 而 惧 怕 ， 知 道 你 必 不 以 我 为 无 辜 。 \\n\\n [kjv] I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent. \\n\\n [bbe] I go in fear of all my pains; I am certain that I will not be free from sin in your eyes. \\n\\n 9:29 [hgb] 我 必 被 你 定 为 有 罪 ， 我 何 必 徒 然 劳 苦 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain? \\n\\n [bbe] You will not let me be clear of sin! why then do I take trouble for nothing? \\n\\n 9:30 [hgb] 我 若 用 雪 水 洗 身 ， 用 碱 洁 净 我 的 手 。 \\n\\n [kjv] If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean; \\n\\n [bbe] If I am washed with snow water, and make my hands clean with soap; \\n\\n 9:31 [hgb] 你 还 要 扔 我 在 坑 里 ， 我 的 衣 服 都 憎 恶 我 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me. \\n\\n [bbe] Then you will have me pushed into the dust, so that I will seem disgusting to my very clothing. \\n\\n 9:32 [hgb] 他 本 不 像 我 是 人 ， 使 我 可 以 回 答 他 ， 又 使 我 们 可 以 同 听 审 判 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment. \\n\\n [bbe] For he is not a man as I am, that I might give him an answer, that we might come together before a judge. \\n\\n 9:33 [hgb] 我 们 中 间 没 有 听 讼 的 人 ， 可 以 向 我 们 两 造 按 手 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both. \\n\\n [bbe] There is no one to give a decision between us, who might have control over us. \\n\\n 9:34 [hgb] 愿 他 把 杖 离 开 我 ， 不 使 惊 惶 威 吓 我 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me: \\n\\n [bbe] Let him take away his rod from me and not send his fear on me: \\n\\n 9:35 [hgb] 我 就 说 话 ， 也 不 惧 怕 他 ， 现 在 我 却 不 是 那 样 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me. \\n\\n [bbe] Then I would say what is in my mind without fear of him; for there is no cause of fear in myself. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114/1612.html","bookId":183,"book":{"id":183,"title":"约伯记 Job","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 乌 斯 地 有 一 个 人 名 叫 约 伯 。 那 人 完 全 正 直 ， 敬 畏 神 ， 远 离 恶 事 。 [kjv] There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared G...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
