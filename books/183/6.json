{"id":5704,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"6:1 [hgb] 约 伯 回 答 说 ， [kjv] But Job answered and said, [bbe] And Job made answer and said, 6:2 [hgb] 惟 愿 我 的 烦 恼 称 一 称 ， 我 一 切 的 灾 害 放 在 天 平 里 。 [kjv] Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together! [bbe] If only my passion might be measured, and put into the scales against my trouble! 6:3 [hgb] 现 今 都 比 海 沙 更 重 ， 所 以 我 的 言 语 急 躁 。 [kjv] For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up. [bbe] For then its weight would be more than the sand of the seas: because of this my words have been uncontrolled. 6:4 [hgb] 因 全 能 者 的 箭 射 入 我 身 ， 其 毒 ， 我 的 灵 喝 尽 了 。 神 的 惊 吓 摆 阵 攻 击 我 。 [kjv] For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me. [bbe] For the arrows of the Ruler of all are present with me, and their poison goes deep into my spirit: his army of fears is put in order against me. 6:5 [hgb] 野 驴 有 草 岂 能 叫 唤 ， 牛 有 料 ， 岂 能 吼 叫 。 [kjv] Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder? [bbe] Does the ass of the fields give out his voice when he has grass? or does the ox make sounds over his food? 6:6 [hgb] 物 淡 而 无 盐 岂 可 吃 吗 ？ 蛋 青 有 什 么 滋 味 呢 ？ [kjv] Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg? [bbe] Will a man take food which has no taste without salt? or is there any taste in the soft substance of purslain? 6:7 [hgb] 看 为 可 厌 的 食 物 ， 我 心 不 肯 挨 近 。 [kjv] The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat. [bbe] My soul has no desire for such things, they are as disease in my food. 6:8 [hgb] 惟 愿 我 得 着 所 求 的 ， 愿 神 赐 我 所 切 望 的 。 [kjv] Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for! [bbe] If only I might have an answer to my prayer, and God would give me my desire! 6:9 [hgb] 就 是 愿 神 把 我 压 碎 ， 伸 手 将 我 剪 除 。 [kjv] Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off! [bbe] If only he would be pleased to put an end to me; and would let loose his hand, so that I might be cut off! 6:10 [hgb] 我 因 没 有 违 弃 那 圣 者 的 言 语 ， 就 仍 以 此 为 安 慰 ， 在 不 止 息 的 痛 苦 中 还 可 踊 跃 。 [kjv] Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One. [bbe] So I would still have comfort, and I would have joy in the pains of death, for I have not been false to the words of the Holy One. 6:11 [hgb] 我 有 什 么 气 力 使 我 等 候 。 我 有 什 么 结 局 使 我 忍 耐 。 [kjv] What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life? [bbe] Have I strength to go on waiting, or have I any end to be looking forward to? 6:12 [hgb] 我 的 气 力 岂 是 石 头 的 气 力 。 我 的 肉 身 岂 是 铜 的 呢 ？ [kjv] Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass? [bbe] Is my strength the strength of stones, or is my flesh brass? 6:13 [hgb] 在 我 岂 不 是 毫 无 帮 助 吗 ？ 智 慧 岂 不 是 从 我 心 中 赶 出 净 尽 吗 ？ [kjv] Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me? [bbe] I have no help in myself, and wisdom is completely gone from me. 6:14 [hgb] 那 将 要 灰 心 ， 离 弃 全 能 者 ， 不 敬 畏 神 的 人 ， 他 的 朋 友 当 以 慈 爱 待 他 。 [kjv] To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty. [bbe] He whose heart is shut against his friend has given up the fear of the Ruler of all. 6:15 [hgb] 我 的 弟 兄 诡 诈 ， 好 像 溪 水 ， 又 像 溪 水 流 干 的 河 道 。 [kjv] My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away; [bbe] My friends have been false like a stream, like streams in the valleys which come to an end: 6:16 [hgb] 这 河 因 结 冰 发 黑 ， 有 雪 藏 在 其 中 。 [kjv] Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid: [bbe] Which are dark because of the ice, and the snow falling into them; 6:17 [hgb] 天 气 渐 暖 就 随 时 消 化 ， 日 头 炎 热 便 从 原 处 干 涸 。 [kjv] What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place. [bbe] Under the burning sun they are cut off, and come to nothing because of the heat. 6:18 [hgb] 结 伴 的 客 旅 离 弃 大 道 ， 顺 河 边 行 ， 到 荒 野 之 地 死 亡 。 [kjv] The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish. [bbe] The camel-trains go out of their way; they go up into the waste and come to destruction. 6:19 [hgb] 提 玛 结 伴 的 客 旅 瞻 望 。 示 巴 同 伙 的 人 等 候 。 [kjv] The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them. [bbe] The camel-trains of Tema were searching with care, the bands of Sheba were waiting for them: 6:20 [hgb] 他 们 因 失 了 盼 望 就 抱 愧 ， 来 到 那 里 便 蒙 羞 。 [kjv] They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed. [bbe] They were put to shame because of their hope; they came and their hope was gone. 6:21 [hgb] 现 在 你 们 正 是 这 样 ， 看 见 惊 吓 的 事 便 惧 怕 。 [kjv] For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid. [bbe] So have you now become to me; you see my sad condition and are in fear. 6:22 [hgb] 我 岂 说 ， 请 你 们 供 给 我 ， 从 你 们 的 财 物 中 送 礼 物 给 我 。 [kjv] Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance? [bbe] Did I say, Give me something? or, Make a payment for me out of your wealth? 6:23 [hgb] 岂 说 ， 拯 救 我 脱 离 敌 人 的 手 吗 ？ 救 赎 我 脱 离 强 暴 人 的 手 吗 ？ [kjv] Or, Deliver me from the enemy\u0027s hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty? [bbe] Or, Get me out of the power of my hater? or, Give money so that I may be free from the power of the cruel ones? 6:24 [hgb] 请 你 们 教 导 我 ， 我 便 不 作 声 。 使 我 明 白 在 何 事 上 有 错 。 [kjv] Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred. [bbe] Give me teaching and I will be quiet; and make me see my error. 6:25 [hgb] 正 直 的 言 语 力 量 何 其 大 。 但 你 们 责 备 是 责 备 什 么 呢 ？ [kjv] How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove? [bbe] How pleasing are upright words! but what force is there in your arguments? 6:26 [hgb] 绝 望 人 的 讲 论 既 然 如 风 ， 你 们 还 想 要 驳 正 言 语 吗 ？ [kjv] Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind? [bbe] My words may seem wrong to you, but the words of him who has no hope are for the wind. 6:27 [hgb] 你 们 想 为 孤 儿 拈 阄 ， 以 朋 友 当 货 物 。 [kjv] Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend. [bbe] Truly, you are such as would give up the child of a dead man to his creditors, and would make a profit out of your friend. 6:28 [hgb] 现 在 请 你 们 看 看 我 ， 我 决 不 当 面 说 谎 。 [kjv] Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie. [bbe] Now then, let your eyes be turned to me, for truly I will not say what is false to your face. 6:29 [hgb] 请 你 们 转 意 ， 不 要 不 公 。 请 再 转 意 ， 我 的 事 有 理 。 [kjv] Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it. [bbe] Let your minds be changed, and do not have an evil opinion of me; yes, be changed, for my righteousness is still in me. 6:30 [hgb] 我 的 舌 上 岂 有 不 义 吗 ？ 我 的 口 里 岂 不 辨 奸 恶 吗 ？ [kjv] Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things? [bbe] Is there evil in my tongue? is not the cause of my trouble clear to me?","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114/1609.html","bookId":183,"book":{"id":183,"title":"约伯记 Job","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 乌 斯 地 有 一 个 人 名 叫 约 伯 。 那 人 完 全 正 直 ， 敬 畏 神 ， 远 离 恶 事 。 [kjv] There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared G...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
