{"id":5730,"no":32,"title":"Chapter 32","content":"32:1 [hgb] 于 是 这 三 个 人 ， 因 约 伯 自 以 为 义 就 ， 不 再 回 答 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. \\n\\n [bbe] So these three men gave no more answers to Job, because he seemed to himself to be right. \\n\\n 32:2 [hgb] 那 时 有 布 西 人 ， 兰 族 巴 拉 迦 的 儿 子 ， 以 利 户 向 约 伯 发 怒 。 因 约 伯 自 以 为 义 ， 不 以 神 为 义 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God. \\n\\n [bbe] And Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was angry, burning with wrath against Job, because he seemed to himself more right than God; \\n\\n 32:3 [hgb] 他 又 向 约 伯 的 三 个 朋 友 发 怒 。 因 为 他 们 想 不 出 回 答 的 话 来 ， 仍 以 约 伯 为 有 罪 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job. \\n\\n [bbe] And he was angry with his three friends, because they had been unable to give him an answer, and had not made Job\u0027s sin clear. \\n\\n 32:4 [hgb] 以 利 户 要 与 约 伯 说 话 ， 就 等 候 他 们 ， 因 为 他 们 比 自 己 年 老 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he. \\n\\n [bbe] Now Elihu had kept quiet while Job was talking, because they were older than he; \\n\\n 32:5 [hgb] 以 利 户 见 这 三 个 人 口 中 无 话 回 答 ， 就 怒 气 发 作 。 \\n\\n [kjv] When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled. \\n\\n [bbe] And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men, he was very angry. \\n\\n 32:6 [hgb] 布 西 人 ， 巴 拉 迦 的 儿 子 ， 以 利 户 回 答 说 ， 我 年 轻 ， 你 们 老 迈 。 因 此 我 退 让 ， 不 敢 向 你 们 陈 说 我 的 意 见 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion. \\n\\n [bbe] And Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, made answer and said, I am young, and you are very old, so I was in fear, and kept myself from putting my knowledge before you. \\n\\n 32:7 [hgb] 我 说 ， 年 老 的 当 先 说 话 。 寿 高 的 当 以 智 慧 教 训 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom. \\n\\n [bbe] I said to myself, It is right for the old to say what is in their minds, and for those who are far on in years to give out wisdom. \\n\\n 32:8 [hgb] 但 在 人 里 面 有 灵 ， 全 能 者 的 气 使 人 有 聪 明 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding. \\n\\n [bbe] But truly it is the spirit in man, even the breath of the Ruler of all, which gives them knowledge. \\n\\n 32:9 [hgb] 尊 贵 的 不 都 有 智 慧 。 寿 高 的 不 都 能 明 白 公 平 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment. \\n\\n [bbe] It is not the old who are wise, and those who are full of years have not the knowledge of what is right. \\n\\n 32:10 [hgb] 因 此 我 说 ， 你 们 要 听 我 言 ， 我 也 要 陈 说 我 的 意 见 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion. \\n\\n [bbe] So I say, Give ear to me, and I will put forward my knowledge. \\n\\n 32:11 [hgb] 你 们 查 究 所 要 说 的 话 。 那 时 我 等 候 你 们 的 话 ， 侧 耳 听 你 们 的 辩 论 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say. \\n\\n [bbe] I was waiting for your words, I was giving ear to your wise sayings; while you were searching out what to say, \\n\\n 32:12 [hgb] 留 心 听 你 们 。 谁 知 你 们 中 间 无 一 人 折 服 约 伯 ， 驳 倒 他 的 话 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words: \\n\\n [bbe] I was taking note; and truly not one of you was able to make clear Job\u0027s error, or to give an answer to his words. \\n\\n 32:13 [hgb] 你 们 切 不 可 说 ， 我 们 寻 得 智 慧 。 神 能 胜 他 ， 人 却 不 能 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man. \\n\\n [bbe] Take care that you do not say, Wisdom is here; God may overcome him, but not man. \\n\\n 32:14 [hgb] 约 伯 没 有 向 我 争 辩 。 我 也 不 用 你 们 的 话 回 答 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches. \\n\\n [bbe] I will not put forward words like these, or make use of your sayings in answer to him. \\n\\n 32:15 [hgb] 他 们 惊 奇 不 再 回 答 ， 一 言 不 发 。 \\n\\n [kjv] They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking. \\n\\n [bbe] Fear has overcome them, they have no more answers to give; they have come to an end of words. \\n\\n 32:16 [hgb] 我 岂 因 他 们 不 说 话 ， 站 住 不 再 回 答 ， 仍 旧 等 候 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;) \\n\\n [bbe] And am I to go on waiting while they have nothing to say? while they keep quiet and give no more answers? \\n\\n 32:17 [hgb] 我 也 要 回 答 我 的 一 分 话 ， 陈 说 我 的 意 见 。 \\n\\n [kjv] I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion. \\n\\n [bbe] I will give my answer; I will put forward my knowledge: \\n\\n 32:18 [hgb] 因 为 我 的 言 语 满 怀 。 我 里 面 的 灵 激 动 我 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me. \\n\\n [bbe] For I am full of words, I am unable to keep in my breath any longer: \\n\\n 32:19 [hgb] 我 的 胸 怀 如 盛 酒 之 囊 ， 没 有 出 气 之 缝 ， 又 如 新 皮 袋 快 要 破 裂 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles. \\n\\n [bbe] My stomach is like wine which is unable to get out; like skins full of new wine, it is almost burst. \\n\\n 32:20 [hgb] 我 要 说 话 ， 使 我 舒 畅 。 我 要 开 口 回 答 。 \\n\\n [kjv] I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer. \\n\\n [bbe] Let me say what is in my mind, so that I may get comfort; let me give answer with open mouth. \\n\\n 32:21 [hgb] 我 必 不 看 人 的 情 面 ， 也 不 奉 承 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Let me not, I pray you, accept any man\u0027s person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man. \\n\\n [bbe] Let me not give respect to any man, or give names of honour to any living. \\n\\n 32:22 [hgb] 我 不 晓 得 奉 承 。 若 奉 承 ， 造 我 的 主 必 快 快 除 灭 我 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away. \\n\\n [bbe] For I am not able to give names of honour to any man; and if I did, my Maker would quickly take me away. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114/1635.html","bookId":183,"book":{"id":183,"title":"约伯记 Job","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 乌 斯 地 有 一 个 人 名 叫 约 伯 。 那 人 完 全 正 直 ， 敬 畏 神 ， 远 离 恶 事 。 [kjv] There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared G...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
