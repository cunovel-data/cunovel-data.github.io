{"id":5722,"no":24,"title":"Chapter 24","content":"24:1 [hgb] 全 能 者 既 定 期 罚 恶 ， 为 何 不 使 认 识 他 的 人 看 见 那 日 子 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days? \\n\\n [bbe] Why are times not stored up by the Ruler of all, and why do those who have knowledge of him not see his days? \\n\\n 24:2 [hgb] 有 人 挪 移 地 界 ， 抢 夺 群 畜 而 牧 养 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof. \\n\\n [bbe] The landmarks are changed by evil men, they violently take away flocks, together with their keepers. \\n\\n 24:3 [hgb] 他 们 拉 去 孤 儿 的 驴 ， 强 取 寡 妇 的 牛 为 当 头 。 \\n\\n [kjv] They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow\u0027s ox for a pledge. \\n\\n [bbe] They send away the ass of him who has no father, they take the widow\u0027s ox for debt. \\n\\n 24:4 [hgb] 他 们 使 穷 人 离 开 正 道 ， 世 上 的 贫 民 尽 都 隐 藏 。 \\n\\n [kjv] They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together. \\n\\n [bbe] The crushed are turned out of the way; all the poor of the earth go into a secret place together. \\n\\n 24:5 [hgb] 这 些 贫 穷 人 ， 如 同 野 驴 出 到 旷 野 ， 殷 勤 寻 找 食 物 。 他 们 靠 着 野 地 给 儿 女 糊 口 ， \\n\\n [kjv] Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children. \\n\\n [bbe] Like asses in the waste land they go out to their work, looking for food with care; from the waste land they get bread for their children. \\n\\n 24:6 [hgb] 收 割 别 人 田 间 的 禾 稼 ， 摘 取 恶 人 余 剩 的 葡 萄 。 \\n\\n [kjv] They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked. \\n\\n [bbe] They get mixed grain from the field, and they take away the late fruit from the vines of those who have wealth. \\n\\n 24:7 [hgb] 终 夜 赤 身 无 衣 ， 天 气 寒 冷 毫 无 遮 盖 ， \\n\\n [kjv] They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold. \\n\\n [bbe] They take their rest at night without clothing, and have no cover in the cold. \\n\\n 24:8 [hgb] 在 山 上 被 大 雨 淋 湿 ， 因 没 有 避 身 之 处 就 挨 近 磐 石 。 \\n\\n [kjv] They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter. \\n\\n [bbe] They are wet with the rain of the mountains, and get into the cracks of the rock for cover. \\n\\n 24:9 [hgb] 又 有 人 从 母 怀 中 抢 夺 孤 儿 ， 强 取 穷 人 的 衣 服 为 当 头 。 \\n\\n [kjv] They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor. \\n\\n [bbe] The child without a father is forced from its mother\u0027s breast, and they take the young children of the poor for debt. \\n\\n 24:10 [hgb] 使 人 赤 身 无 衣 ， 到 处 流 行 ， 且 因 饥 饿 扛 抬 禾 捆 ， \\n\\n [kjv] They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry; \\n\\n [bbe] Others go about without clothing, and though they have no food, they get in the grain from the fields. \\n\\n 24:11 [hgb] 在 那 些 人 的 围 墙 内 造 油 ， 榨 酒 ， 自 己 还 口 渴 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst. \\n\\n [bbe] Between the lines of olive-trees they make oil; though they have no drink, they are crushing out the grapes. \\n\\n 24:12 [hgb] 在 多 民 的 城 内 有 人 唉 哼 ， 受 伤 的 人 哀 号 。 神 却 不 理 会 那 恶 人 的 愚 妄 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them. \\n\\n [bbe] From the town come sounds of pain from those who are near death, and the soul of the wounded is crying out for help; but God does not take note of their prayer. \\n\\n 24:13 [hgb] 又 有 人 背 弃 光 明 ， 不 认 识 光 明 的 道 ， 不 住 在 光 明 的 路 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof. \\n\\n [bbe] Then there are those who are haters of the light, who have no knowledge of its ways, and do not go in them. \\n\\n 24:14 [hgb] 杀 人 的 黎 明 起 来 ， 杀 害 困 苦 穷 乏 人 ， 夜 间 又 作 盗 贼 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief. \\n\\n [bbe] He who is purposing death gets up before day, so that he may put to death the poor and those in need. \\n\\n 24:15 [hgb] 奸 夫 等 候 黄 昏 ， 说 ， 必 无 眼 能 见 我 ， 就 把 脸 蒙 蔽 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face. \\n\\n [bbe] And the man whose desire is for the wife of another is waiting for the evening, saying, No eye will see me; and he puts a cover on his face. And in the night the thief goes about; \\n\\n 24:16 [hgb] 盗 贼 黑 夜 挖 窟 窿 ， 白 日 躲 藏 ， 并 不 认 识 光 明 。 \\n\\n [kjv] In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light. \\n\\n [bbe] In the dark he makes holes in the walls of houses: in the daytime they are shutting themselves up, they have no knowledge of the light. \\n\\n 24:17 [hgb] 他 们 看 早 晨 如 幽 暗 ， 因 为 他 们 晓 得 幽 暗 的 惊 骇 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death. \\n\\n [bbe] For the middle of the night is as morning to them, they are not troubled by the fear of the dark. \\n\\n 24:18 [hgb] 这 些 恶 人 犹 如 浮 萍 快 快 飘 去 。 他 们 所 得 的 分 在 世 上 被 咒 诅 。 他 们 不 得 再 走 葡 萄 园 的 路 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards. \\n\\n [bbe] They go quickly on the face of the waters; their heritage is cursed in the earth; the steps of the crusher of grapes are not turned to their vine-garden. \\n\\n 24:19 [hgb] 干 旱 炎 热 消 没 雪 水 ， 阴 间 也 如 此 消 没 犯 罪 之 辈 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have sinned. \\n\\n [bbe] Snow waters become dry with the heat: so do sinners go down into the underworld. \\n\\n 24:20 [hgb] 怀 他 的 母 （ 原 文 作 胎 ） 要 忘 记 他 。 虫 子 要 吃 他 ， 觉 得 甘 甜 。 他 不 再 被 人 记 念 。 不 义 的 人 必 如 树 折 断 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree. \\n\\n [bbe] The public place of his town has no more knowledge of him, and his name has gone from the memory of men: he is rooted up like a dead tree. \\n\\n 24:21 [hgb] 他 恶 待 （ 或 作 他 吞 灭 ） 不 怀 孕 不 生 养 的 妇 人 ， 不 善 待 寡 妇 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow. \\n\\n [bbe] He is not kind to the widow, and he has no pity for her child. \\n\\n 24:22 [hgb] 然 而 神 用 能 力 保 全 有 势 力 的 人 ， 那 性 命 难 保 的 人 仍 然 兴 起 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life. \\n\\n [bbe] But God by his power gives long life to the strong; he gets up again, though he has no hope of life. \\n\\n 24:23 [hgb] 神 使 他 们 安 稳 ， 他 们 就 有 所 倚 靠 。 神 的 眼 目 也 看 顾 他 们 的 道 路 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways. \\n\\n [bbe] He takes away his fear of danger and gives him support; and his eyes are on his ways. \\n\\n 24:24 [hgb] 他 们 被 高 举 ， 不 过 片 时 就 没 有 了 。 他 们 降 为 卑 ， 被 除 灭 ， 与 众 人 一 样 ， 又 如 谷 穗 被 割 。 \\n\\n [kjv] They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn. \\n\\n [bbe] For a short time they are lifted up; then they are gone; they are made low, they are pulled off like fruit, and like the heads of grain they are cut off. \\n\\n 24:25 [hgb] 若 不 是 这 样 ， 谁 能 证 实 我 是 说 谎 的 ， 将 我 的 言 语 驳 为 虚 空 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth? \\n\\n [bbe] And if it is not so, now, who will make it clear that my words are false, and that what I say is of no value? \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114/1627.html","bookId":183,"book":{"id":183,"title":"约伯记 Job","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 乌 斯 地 有 一 个 人 名 叫 约 伯 。 那 人 完 全 正 直 ， 敬 畏 神 ， 远 离 恶 事 。 [kjv] There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared G...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
