{"id":5714,"no":16,"title":"Chapter 16","content":"16:1 [hgb] 约 伯 回 答 说 ， [kjv] Then Job answered and said, [bbe] And Job made answer and said, 16:2 [hgb] 这 样 的 话 我 听 了 许 多 。 你 们 安 慰 人 ， 反 叫 人 愁 烦 。 [kjv] I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all. [bbe] Such things have frequently come to my ears: you are comforters who only give trouble. 16:3 [hgb] 虚 空 的 言 语 有 穷 尽 吗 ？ 有 什 么 话 惹 动 你 回 答 呢 ？ [kjv] Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest? [bbe] May words which are like the wind be stopped? or what is troubling you to make answer to them? 16:4 [hgb] 我 也 能 说 你 们 那 样 的 话 。 你 们 若 处 在 我 的 境 遇 ， 我 也 会 联 络 言 语 攻 击 你 们 ， 又 能 向 你 们 摇 头 。 [kjv] I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul\u0027s stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you. [bbe] It would not be hard for me to say such things if your souls were in my soul\u0027s place; joining words together against you, and shaking my head at you: 16:5 [hgb] 但 我 必 用 口 坚 固 你 们 ， 用 嘴 消 解 你 们 的 忧 愁 。 [kjv] But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief. [bbe] I might give you strength with my mouth, and not keep back the comfort of my lips. 16:6 [hgb] 我 虽 说 话 ， 忧 愁 仍 不 得 消 解 。 我 虽 停 住 不 说 ， 忧 愁 就 离 开 我 吗 ？ [kjv] Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased? [bbe] If I say what is in my mind, my pain becomes no less: and if I keep quiet, how much of it goes from me? 16:7 [hgb] 但 现 在 神 使 我 困 倦 ， 使 亲 友 远 离 我 。 [kjv] But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company. [bbe] But now he has overcome me with weariness and fear, and I am in the grip of all my trouble. 16:8 [hgb] 又 抓 住 我 ， 作 见 证 攻 击 我 。 我 身 体 的 枯 瘦 ， 也 当 面 见 证 我 的 不 是 。 [kjv] And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face. [bbe] It has come up as a witness against me, and the wasting of my flesh makes answer to my face. 16:9 [hgb] 主 发 怒 撕 裂 我 ， 逼 迫 我 ， 向 我 切 齿 。 我 的 敌 人 怒 目 看 我 。 [kjv] He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me. [bbe] I am broken by his wrath, and his hate has gone after me; he has made his teeth sharp against me: my haters are looking on me with cruel eyes; 16:10 [hgb] 他 们 向 我 开 口 ， 打 我 的 脸 羞 辱 我 ， 聚 会 攻 击 我 。 [kjv] They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me. [bbe] Their mouths are open wide against me; the blows of his bitter words are falling on my face; all of them come together in a mass against me. 16:11 [hgb] 神 把 我 交 给 不 敬 虔 的 人 ， 把 我 扔 到 恶 人 的 手 中 。 [kjv] God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked. [bbe] God gives me over to the power of sinners, sending me violently into the hands of evil-doers. 16:12 [hgb] 我 素 来 安 逸 ， 他 折 断 我 ， 掐 住 我 的 颈 项 ， 把 我 摔 碎 。 又 立 我 为 他 的 箭 靶 子 。 [kjv] I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark. [bbe] I was in comfort, but I have been broken up by his hands; he has taken me by the neck, shaking me to bits; he has put me up as a mark for his arrows. 16:13 [hgb] 他 的 弓 箭 手 四 面 围 绕 我 。 他 破 裂 我 的 肺 腑 ， 并 不 留 情 ， 把 我 的 胆 倾 倒 在 地 上 ， [kjv] His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground. [bbe] His bowmen come round about me; their arrows go through my body without mercy; my life is drained out on the earth. 16:14 [hgb] 将 我 破 裂 又 破 裂 ， 如 同 勇 士 向 我 直 闯 。 [kjv] He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant. [bbe] I am broken with wound after wound; he comes rushing on me like a man of war. 16:15 [hgb] 我 缝 麻 布 在 我 皮 肤 上 ， 把 我 的 角 放 在 尘 土 中 。 [kjv] I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust. [bbe] I have made haircloth the clothing of my skin, and my horn is rolled in the dust. 16:16 [hgb] 我 的 脸 因 哭 泣 发 紫 ， 在 我 的 眼 皮 上 有 死 荫 。 [kjv] My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death; [bbe] My face is red with weeping, and my eyes are becoming dark; 16:17 [hgb] 我 的 手 中 却 无 强 暴 。 我 的 祈 祷 也 是 清 洁 。 [kjv] Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure. [bbe] Though my hands have done no violent acts, and my prayer is clean. 16:18 [hgb] 地 阿 ， 不 要 遮 盖 我 的 血 。 不 要 阻 挡 我 的 哀 求 。 [kjv] O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place. [bbe] O earth, let not my blood be covered, and let my cry have no resting-place! 16:19 [hgb] 现 今 ， 在 天 有 我 的 见 证 ， 在 上 有 我 的 中 保 。 [kjv] Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high. [bbe] Even now my witness is in heaven, and the supporter of my cause is on high. 16:20 [hgb] 我 的 朋 友 讥 诮 我 ， 我 却 向 神 眼 泪 汪 汪 。 [kjv] My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God. [bbe] My friends make sport of me; to God my eyes are weeping, 16:21 [hgb] 愿 人 得 与 神 辩 白 ， 如 同 人 与 朋 友 辩 白 一 样 。 [kjv] O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour! [bbe] So that he may give decision for a man in his cause with God, and between a son of man and his neighbour. 16:22 [hgb] 因 为 再 过 几 年 ， 我 必 走 那 往 而 不 返 之 路 。 [kjv] When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return. [bbe] For in a short time I will take the journey from which I will not come back.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114/1619.html","bookId":183,"book":{"id":183,"title":"约伯记 Job","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 乌 斯 地 有 一 个 人 名 叫 约 伯 。 那 人 完 全 正 直 ， 敬 畏 神 ， 远 离 恶 事 。 [kjv] There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared G...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
