Get wisdom, and then we will say what is in our minds. \n 18:3 [hgb] 我 们 为 何 算 为 畜 生 ， 在 你 眼 中 看 作 污 秽 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight? \n [bbe] Why do we seem as beasts in your eyes, and as completely without knowledge? \n 18:4 [hgb] 你 这 恼 怒 将 自 己 撕 裂 的 ， 难 道 大 地 为 你 见 弃 ， 磐 石 挪 开 原 处 吗 ？ \n [kjv] He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place? \n [bbe] But come back, now, come: you who are wounding yourself in your passion, will the earth be given up because of you, or a rock be moved out of its place? \n 18:5 [hgb] 恶 人 的 亮 光 必 要 熄 灭 。 他 的 火 焰 必 不 照 耀 。 \n [kjv] Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine. \n [bbe] For the light of the sinner is put out, and the flame of his fire is not shining. \n 18:6 [hgb] 他 帐 棚 中 的 亮 光 要 变 为 黑 暗 。 他 以 上 的 灯 也 必 熄 灭 。 \n [kjv] The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him. \n [bbe] The light is dark in his tent, and the light shining over him is put out. \n 18:7 [hgb] 他 坚 强 的 脚 步 必 见 狭 窄 。 自 己 的 计 谋 必 将 他 绊 倒 。 \n [kjv] The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down. \n [bbe] The steps of his strength become short, and by his design destruction overtakes him. \n 18:8 [hgb] 因 为 他 被 自 己 的 脚 陷 入 网 中 ， 走 在 缠 人 的 网 罗 上 。 \n [kjv] For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare. \n [bbe] His feet take him into the net, and he goes walking into the cords. \n 18:9 [hgb] 圈 套 必 抓 住 他 的 脚 跟 。 机 关 必 擒 获 他 。 \n [kjv] The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him. \n [bbe] His foot is taken in the net; he comes into its grip. \n 18:10 [hgb] 活 扣 为 他 藏 在 土 内 。 羁 绊 为 他 藏 在 路 上 。 \n [kjv] The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way. \n [bbe] The twisted cord is put secretly in the earth to take him, and the cord is placed in his way. \n 18:11 [hgb] 四 面 的 惊 吓 要 使 他 害 怕 ， 并 且 追 赶 他 的 脚 跟 。 \n [kjv] Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet. \n [bbe] He is overcome by fears on every side, they go after him at every step. \n 18:12 [hgb] 他 的 力 量 必 因 饥 饿 衰 败 ， 祸 患 要 在 他 旁 边 等 候 。 \n [kjv] His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be ready at his side. \n [bbe] His strength is made feeble for need of food, and destruction is waiting for his falling footstep. \n 18:13 [hgb] 他 本 身 的 肢 体 要 被 吞 吃 ， 死 亡 的 长 子 要 吞 吃 他 的 肢 体 。 \n [kjv] It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength. \n [bbe] His skin is wasted by disease, and his body is food for the worst of diseases. \n 18:14 [hgb] 他 要 从 所 倚 靠 的 帐 棚 被 拔 出 来 ， 带 到 惊 吓 的 王 那 里 。 \n [kjv] His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors. \n [bbe] He is pulled out of his tent where he was safe, and he is taken away to the king of fears. \n 18:15 [hgb] 不 属 他 的 必 住 在 他 的 帐 棚 里 。 硫 磺 必 撒 在 他 所 住 之 处 。 \n [kjv] It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation. \n [bbe] In his tent will be seen that which is not his, burning stone is dropped on his house. \n 18:16 [hgb] 下 边 ， 他 的 根 本 要 枯 干 。 上 边 ， 他 的 枝 子 要 剪 除 。 \n [kjv] His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off. \n [bbe] Under the earth his roots are dry, and over it his branch is cut off. \n 18:17 [hgb] 他 的 记 念 在 地 上 必 然 灭 亡 。 他 的 名 字 在 街 上 也 不 存 留 。 \n [kjv] His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street. \n [bbe] His memory is gone from the earth, and in the open country there is no knowledge of his name. \n 18:18 [hgb] 他 必 从 光 明 中 被 撵 到 黑 暗 里 ， 必 被 赶 出 世 界 。 \n [kjv] He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world. \n [bbe] He is sent away from the light into the dark; he is forced out of the world. \n 18:19 [hgb] 在 本 民 中 必 无 子 无 孙 。 在 寄 居 之 地 也 无 一 人 存 留 。 \n [kjv] He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings. \n [bbe] He has no offspring or family among his people, and in his living-place there is no one of his name. \n 18:20 [hgb] 以 后 来 的 要 惊 奇 他 的 日 子 ， 好 像 以 前 去 的 受 了 惊 骇 。 \n [kjv] They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted. \n [bbe] At his fate those of the west are shocked, and those of the east are overcome with fear. \n 18:21 [hgb] 不 义 之 人 的 住 处 总 是 这 样 。 此 乃 不 认 识 神 之 人 的 地 步 。 \n [kjv] Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God. \n [bbe] Truly, these are the houses of the sinner, and this is the place of him who has no knowledge of God. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114/1621.html","bookId":183,"book":{"id":183,"title":"约伯记 Job","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 乌 斯 地 有 一 个 人 名 叫 约 伯 。 那 人 完 全 正 直 ， 敬 畏 神 ， 远 离 恶 事 。 [kjv] There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared G...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
