{"id":5739,"no":41,"title":"Chapter 41","content":"41:1 [hgb] 你 能 用 鱼 钩 钓 上 鳄 鱼 吗 ？ 能 用 绳 子 压 下 它 的 舌 头 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down? \n [bbe] Is it possible for Leviathan to be pulled out with a fish-hook, or for a hook to be put through the bone of his mouth? \n 41:2 [hgb] 你 能 用 绳 索 穿 它 的 鼻 子 吗 ？ 能 用 钩 穿 它 的 腮 骨 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn? \n [bbe] Will you put a cord into his nose, or take him away with a cord round his tongue? \n 41:3 [hgb] 它 岂 向 你 连 连 恳 求 ， 说 柔 和 的 话 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee? \n [bbe] Will he make prayers to you, or say soft words to you? \n 41:4 [hgb] 岂 肯 与 你 立 约 ， 使 你 拿 它 永 远 作 奴 仆 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever? \n [bbe] Will he make an agreement with you, so that you may take him as a servant for ever? \n 41:5 [hgb] 你 岂 可 拿 它 当 雀 鸟 玩 耍 吗 ？ 岂 可 为 你 的 幼 女 将 它 拴 住 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? \n [bbe] Will you make sport with him, as with a bird? or put him in chains for your young women? \n 41:6 [hgb] 搭 伙 的 渔 夫 岂 可 拿 它 当 货 物 吗 ？ 能 把 它 分 给 商 人 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants? \n [bbe] Will the fishermen make profit out of him? will they have him cut up for the traders? \n 41:7 [hgb] 你 能 用 倒 钩 枪 扎 满 它 的 皮 ， 能 用 鱼 叉 叉 满 它 的 头 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears? \n [bbe] Will you put sharp-pointed irons into his skin, or fish-spears into his head? \n 41:8 [hgb] 你 按 手 在 它 身 上 ， 想 与 它 争 战 ， 就 不 再 这 样 行 吧 。 \n [kjv] Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more. \n [bbe] Only put your hand on him, and see what a fight you will have; you will not do it again! \n 41:9 [hgb] 人 指 望 捉 拿 它 是 徒 然 的 。 一 见 它 ， 岂 不 丧 胆 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him? \n [bbe] Truly, the hope of his attacker is false; he is overcome even on seeing him! \n 41:10 [hgb] 没 有 那 么 凶 猛 的 人 敢 惹 它 。 这 样 ， 谁 能 在 我 面 前 站 立 得 住 呢 ？ \n [kjv] None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me? \n [bbe] He is so cruel that no one is ready to go against him. Who then is able to keep his place before me? \n 41:11 [hgb] 谁 先 给 我 什 么 ， 使 我 偿 还 呢 ？ 天 下 万 物 都 是 我 的 。 \n [kjv] Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine. \n [bbe] Who ever went against me, and got the better of me? There is no one under heaven! \n 41:12 [hgb] 论 到 鳄 鱼 的 肢 体 和 其 大 力 ， 并 美 好 的 骨 骼 ， 我 不 能 缄 默 不 言 。 \n [kjv] I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion. \n [bbe] I will not keep quiet about the parts of his body, or about his power, and the strength of his frame. \n 41:13 [hgb] 谁 能 剥 它 的 外 衣 ？ 谁 能 进 它 上 下 牙 骨 之 间 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle? \n [bbe] Who has ever taken off his outer skin? who may come inside his inner coat of iron? \n 41:14 [hgb] 谁 能 开 它 的 腮 颊 ？ 它 牙 齿 四 围 是 可 畏 的 。 \n [kjv] Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about. \n [bbe] Who has made open the doors of his face? Fear is round about his teeth. \n 41:15 [hgb] 它 以 坚 固 的 鳞 甲 为 可 夸 ， 紧 紧 合 闭 ， 封 得 严 密 。 \n [kjv] His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal. \n [bbe] His back is made of lines of plates, joined tight together, one against the other, like a stamp. \n 41:16 [hgb] 这 鳞 甲 一 一 相 连 ， 甚 至 气 不 得 透 入 其 间 ， \n [kjv] One is so near to another, that no air can come between them. \n [bbe] One is so near to the other that no air may come between them. \n 41:17 [hgb] 都 是 互 相 联 络 ， 胶 结 ， 不 能 分 离 。 \n [kjv] They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered. \n [bbe] They take a grip of one another; they are joined together, so that they may not be parted. \n 41:18 [hgb] 它 打 喷 嚏 就 发 出 光 来 。 它 眼 睛 好 像 早 晨 的 光 线 （ 光 线 原 文 作 眼 皮 ） 。 \n [kjv] By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. \n [bbe] His sneezings give out flames, and his eyes are like the eyes of the dawn. \n 41:19 [hgb] 从 它 口 中 发 出 烧 着 的 火 把 ， 与 飞 迸 的 火 星 。 \n [kjv] Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out. \n [bbe] Out of his mouth go burning lights, and flames of fire are jumping up. \n 41:20 [hgb] 从 它 鼻 孔 冒 出 烟 来 ， 如 烧 开 的 锅 和 点 着 的 芦 苇 。 \n [kjv] Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron. \n [bbe] Smoke comes out of his nose, like a pot boiling on the fire. \n 41:21 [hgb] 它 的 气 点 着 煤 炭 ， 有 火 焰 从 它 口 中 发 出 。 \n [kjv] His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth. \n [bbe] His breath puts fire to coals, and a flame goes out of his mouth. \n 41:22 [hgb] 它 颈 项 中 存 着 劲 力 。 在 它 面 前 的 都 恐 吓 蹦 跳 。 \n [kjv] In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him. \n [bbe] Strength is in his neck, and fear goes dancing before him. \n 41:23 [hgb] 它 的 肉 块 互 相 联 络 ， 紧 贴 其 身 ， 不 能 摇 动 。 \n [kjv] The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved. \n [bbe] The plates of his flesh are joined together, fixed, and not to be moved. \n 41:24 [hgb] 它 的 心 结 实 如 石 头 ， 如 下 磨 石 那 样 结 实 。 \n [kjv] His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone. \n [bbe] His heart is as strong as a stone, hard as the lower crushing-stone. \n 41:25 [hgb] 它 一 起 来 ， 勇 士 都 惊 恐 ， 心 里 慌 乱 ， 便 都 昏 迷 。 \n [kjv] When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves. \n [bbe] When he gets ready for the fight, the strong are overcome with fear. \n 41:26 [hgb] 人 若 用 刀 ， 用 枪 ， 用 标 枪 ， 用 尖 枪 扎 它 ， 都 是 无 用 。 \n [kjv] The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon. \n [bbe] The sword may come near him but is not able to go through him; the spear, or the arrow, or the sharp-pointed iron. \n 41:27 [hgb] 它 以 铁 为 干 草 ， 以 铜 为 烂 木 。 \n [kjv] He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood. \n [bbe] Iron is to him as dry grass, and brass as soft wood. \n 41:28 [hgb] 箭 不 能 恐 吓 它 使 它 逃 避 。 弹 石 在 它 看 为 碎 秸 。 \n [kjv] The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble. \n [bbe] The arrow is not able to put him to flight: stones are no more to him than dry stems. \n 41:29 [hgb] 棍 棒 算 为 禾 秸 。 它 嗤 笑 短 枪 飕 的 响 声 。 \n [kjv] Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear. \n [bbe] A thick stick is no better than a leaf of grass, and he makes sport of the onrush of the spear. \n 41:30 [hgb] 它 肚 腹 下 如 尖 瓦 片 ， 它 如 钉 耙 经 过 淤 泥 。 \n [kjv] Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire. \n [bbe] Under him are sharp edges of broken pots: as if he was pulling a grain-crushing instrument over the wet earth. \n 41:31 [hgb] 它 使 深 渊 开 滚 如 锅 ， 使 洋 海 如 锅 中 的 膏 油 。 \n [kjv] He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment. \n [bbe] The deep is boiling like a pot of spices, and the sea like a perfume-vessel. \n 41:32 [hgb] 它 行 的 路 随 后 发 光 ， 令 人 想 深 渊 如 同 白 发 。 \n [kjv] He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary. \n [bbe] After him his way is shining, so that the deep seems white. \n 41:33 [hgb] 在 地 上 没 有 像 它 造 的 那 样 ， 无 所 惧 怕 。 \n [kjv] Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear. \n [bbe] On earth there is not another like him, who is made without fear. \n 41:34 [hgb] 凡 高 大 的 ， 它 无 不 藐 视 。 它 在 骄 傲 的 水 族 上 作 王 。 \n [kjv] He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride. \n [bbe] Everything which is high goes in fear of him; he is king over all the sons of pride. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114/1644.html","bookId":183,"book":{"id":183,"title":"约伯记 Job","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 乌 斯 地 有 一 个 人 名 叫 约 伯 。 那 人 完 全 正 直 ， 敬 畏 神 ， 远 离 恶 事 。 [kjv] There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job;
