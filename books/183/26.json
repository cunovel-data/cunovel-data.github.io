{"id":5724,"no":26,"title":"Chapter 26","content":"26:1 [hgb] 约 伯 回 答 说 ， [kjv] But Job answered and said, [bbe] Then Job made answer and said, 26:2 [hgb] 无 能 的 人 ， 蒙 你 何 等 的 帮 助 。 膀 臂 无 力 的 人 ， 蒙 你 何 等 的 拯 救 。 [kjv] How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength? [bbe] How have you given help to him who has no power! how have you been the salvation of the arm which has no strength! 26:3 [hgb] 无 智 慧 的 人 ， 蒙 你 何 等 的 指 教 。 你 向 他 多 显 大 知 识 。 [kjv] How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is? [bbe] How have you given teaching to him who has no wisdom, and fully made clear true knowledge! 26:4 [hgb] 你 向 谁 发 出 言 语 来 。 谁 的 灵 从 你 而 出 。 [kjv] To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee? [bbe] To whom have your words been said? and whose spirit came out from you? 26:5 [hgb] 在 大 水 ， 和 水 族 以 下 的 阴 魂 ， 战 兢 。 [kjv] Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof. [bbe] The shades in the underworld are shaking; the waters and those living in them. 26:6 [hgb] 在 神 面 前 ， 阴 间 显 露 。 灭 亡 也 不 得 遮 掩 。 [kjv] Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering. [bbe] The underworld is uncovered before him, and Destruction has no veil. 26:7 [hgb] 神 将 北 极 铺 在 空 中 ， 将 大 地 悬 在 虚 空 。 [kjv] He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing. [bbe] By his hand the north is stretched out in space, and the earth is hanging on nothing. 26:8 [hgb] 将 水 包 在 密 云 中 ， 云 却 不 破 裂 。 [kjv] He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them. [bbe] By him the waters are shut up in his thick clouds, and the cloud does not give way under them. 26:9 [hgb] 遮 蔽 他 的 宝 座 ， 将 云 铺 在 其 上 。 [kjv] He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it. [bbe] By him the face of his high seat is veiled, and his cloud stretched out over it. 26:10 [hgb] 在 水 面 的 周 围 划 出 界 限 ， 直 到 光 明 黑 暗 的 交 界 。 [kjv] He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end. [bbe] By him a circle is marked out on the face of the waters, to the limits of the light and the dark. 26:11 [hgb] 天 的 柱 子 ， 因 他 的 斥 责 ， 震 动 惊 奇 。 [kjv] The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof. [bbe] The pillars of heaven are shaking, and are overcome by his sharp words. 26:12 [hgb] 他 以 能 力 搅 动 大 海 （ 搅 动 或 作 平 静 ） ， 他 借 知 识 打 伤 拉 哈 伯 。 [kjv] He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud. [bbe] By his power the sea was made quiet; and by his wisdom Rahab was wounded. 26:13 [hgb] 借 他 的 灵 使 天 有 妆 饰 ， 他 的 手 刺 杀 快 蛇 。 [kjv] By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent. [bbe] By his wind the heavens become bright: by his hand the quickly moving snake was cut through. 26:14 [hgb] 看 哪 ， 这 不 过 是 神 工 作 的 些 微 。 我 们 所 听 于 他 的 ， 是 何 等 细 微 的 声 音 。 他 大 能 的 雷 声 谁 能 明 透 呢 ？ [kjv] Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand? [bbe] See, these are only the outskirts of his ways; and how small is that which comes to our ears about him! But the thunder of his acts of power is outside all knowledge.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114/1629.html","bookId":183,"book":{"id":183,"title":"约伯记 Job","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 乌 斯 地 有 一 个 人 名 叫 约 伯 。 那 人 完 全 正 直 ， 敬 畏 神 ， 远 离 恶 事 。 [kjv] There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared G...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
