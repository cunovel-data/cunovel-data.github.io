{"id":5701,"no":3,"title":"Chapter 3","content":"3:1 [hgb] 此 后 ， 约 伯 开 口 咒 诅 自 己 的 生 日 ， [kjv] After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day. [bbe] Then, opening his mouth, and cursing the day of his birth, 3:2 [hgb] 说 ， 愿 我 生 的 那 日 ， 和 说 怀 了 男 胎 的 那 夜 都 灭 没 。 [kjv] And Job spake, and said, [bbe] Job made answer and said, 3:3 [hgb] [kjv] Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived. [bbe] Let destruction take the day of my birth, and the night on which it was said, A man child has come into the world. 3:4 [hgb] 愿 那 日 变 为 黑 暗 。 愿 神 不 从 上 面 寻 找 它 。 愿 亮 光 不 照 于 其 上 。 [kjv] Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it. [bbe] That day--let it be dark; let not God take note of it from on high, and let not the light be shining on it; 3:5 [hgb] 愿 黑 暗 和 死 荫 索 取 那 日 。 愿 密 云 停 在 其 上 。 愿 日 蚀 恐 吓 它 。 [kjv] Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it. [bbe] Let the dark and the black night take it for themselves; let it be covered with a cloud; let the dark shades of day send fear on it. 3:6 [hgb] 愿 那 夜 被 幽 暗 夺 取 ， 不 在 年 中 的 日 子 同 乐 ， 也 不 入 月 中 的 数 目 。 [kjv] As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months. [bbe] That night--let the thick dark take it; let it not have joy among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months. 3:7 [hgb] 愿 那 夜 没 有 生 育 ， 其 间 也 没 有 欢 乐 的 声 音 。 [kjv] Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein. [bbe] As for that night, let it have no fruit; let no voice of joy be sounded in it; 3:8 [hgb] 愿 那 咒 诅 日 子 且 能 惹 动 鳄 鱼 的 ， 咒 诅 那 夜 。 [kjv] Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning. [bbe] Let it be cursed by those who put a curse on the day; who are ready to make Leviathan awake. 3:9 [hgb] 愿 那 夜 黎 明 的 星 宿 变 为 黑 暗 ， 盼 亮 却 不 亮 ， 也 不 见 早 晨 的 光 线 （ 光 线 原 文 作 眼 皮 ） 。 [kjv] Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day: [bbe] Let its morning stars be dark; let it be looking for light, but may it not have any; let it not see the eyes of the dawn. 3:10 [hgb] 因 没 有 把 怀 我 胎 的 门 关 闭 ， 也 没 有 将 患 难 对 我 的 眼 隐 藏 。 [kjv] Because it shut not up the doors of my mother\u0027s womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes. [bbe] Because it did not keep the doors of my mother\u0027s body shut, so that trouble might be veiled from my eyes. 3:11 [hgb] 我 为 何 不 出 母 胎 而 死 。 为 何 不 出 母 腹 绝 气 。 [kjv] Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly? [bbe] Why did death not take me when I came out of my mother\u0027s body, why did I not, when I came out, give up my last breath? 3:12 [hgb] 为 何 有 膝 接 收 我 。 为 何 有 奶 哺 养 我 。 [kjv] Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck? [bbe] Why did the knees take me, or why the breasts that they might give me milk? 3:13 [hgb] 不 然 ， 我 就 早 已 躺 卧 安 睡 。 [kjv] For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest, [bbe] For then I might have gone to my rest in quiet, and in sleep have been in peace, 3:14 [hgb] 和 地 上 为 自 己 重 造 荒 邱 的 君 王 ， 谋 士 。 [kjv] With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves; [bbe] With kings and the wise ones of the earth, who put up great houses for themselves; 3:15 [hgb] 或 与 有 金 子 ， 将 银 子 装 满 了 房 屋 的 王 子 一 同 安 息 。 [kjv] Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver: [bbe] Or with rulers who had gold, and whose houses were full of silver; 3:16 [hgb] 或 像 隐 而 未 现 ， 不 到 期 而 落 的 胎 ， 归 于 无 有 ， 如 同 未 见 光 的 婴 孩 。 [kjv] Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light. [bbe] Or as a child dead at birth I might never have come into existence; like young children who have not seen the light. 3:17 [hgb] 在 那 里 恶 人 止 息 搅 扰 ， 困 乏 人 得 享 安 息 。 [kjv] There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest. [bbe] There the passions of the evil are over, and those whose strength has come to an end have rest. 3:18 [hgb] 被 囚 的 人 同 得 安 逸 ， 不 听 见 督 工 的 声 音 。 [kjv] There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor. [bbe] There the prisoners are at peace together; the voice of the overseer comes not again to their ears. 3:19 [hgb] 大 小 都 在 那 里 。 奴 仆 脱 离 主 人 的 辖 制 。 [kjv] The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master. [bbe] The small and the great are there, and the servant is free from his master. 3:20 [hgb] 受 患 难 的 人 ， 为 何 有 光 赐 给 他 呢 ？ 心 中 愁 苦 的 人 ， 为 何 有 生 命 赐 给 他 呢 ？ [kjv] Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul; [bbe] Why does he give light to him who is in trouble, and life to the bitter in soul; 3:21 [hgb] 他 们 切 望 死 ， 却 不 得 死 。 求 死 ， 胜 于 求 隐 藏 的 珍 宝 。 [kjv] Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures; [bbe] To those whose desire is for death, but it comes not; who are searching for it more than for secret wealth; 3:22 [hgb] 他 们 寻 见 坟 墓 就 快 乐 ， 极 其 欢 喜 。 [kjv] Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave? [bbe] Who are glad with great joy, and full of delight when they come to their last resting-place; 3:23 [hgb] 人 的 道 路 既 然 遮 隐 ， 神 又 把 他 四 面 围 困 ， 为 何 有 光 赐 给 他 呢 ？ [kjv] Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in? [bbe] To a man whose way is veiled, and who is shut in by God? 3:24 [hgb] 我 未 曾 吃 饭 就 发 出 叹 息 。 我 唉 哼 的 声 音 涌 出 如 水 。 [kjv] For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters. [bbe] In place of my food I have grief, and cries of sorrow come from me like water. 3:25 [hgb] 因 我 所 恐 惧 的 临 到 我 身 ， 我 所 惧 怕 的 迎 我 而 来 。 [kjv] For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me. [bbe] For I have a fear and it comes on me, and my heart is greatly troubled. 3:26 [hgb] 我 不 得 安 逸 ， 不 得 平 静 ， 也 不 得 安 息 ， 却 有 患 难 来 到 。 [kjv] I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came. [bbe] I have no peace, no quiet, and no rest; nothing but pain comes on me.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114/1606.html","bookId":183,"book":{"id":183,"title":"约伯记 Job","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 乌 斯 地 有 一 个 人 名 叫 约 伯 。 那 人 完 全 正 直 ， 敬 畏 神 ， 远 离 恶 事 。 [kjv] There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared G...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
