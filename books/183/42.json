{"id":5740,"no":42,"title":"Chapter 42","content":"42:1 [hgb] 约 伯 回 答 耶 和 华 说 ， \\n\\n [kjv] Then Job answered the LORD, and said, \\n\\n [bbe] And Job said in answer to the Lord, \\n\\n 42:2 [hgb] 我 知 道 ， 你 万 事 都 能 做 。 你 的 旨 意 不 能 拦 阻 。 \\n\\n [kjv] I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee. \\n\\n [bbe] I see that you are able to do every thing, and to give effect to all your designs. \\n\\n 42:3 [hgb] 谁 用 无 知 的 言 语 ， 使 你 的 旨 意 隐 藏 呢 ？ 我 所 说 的 ， 是 我 不 明 白 的 。 这 些 事 太 奇 妙 ， 是 我 不 知 道 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not. \\n\\n [bbe] Who is this who makes dark the purpose of God by words without knowledge? For I have been talking without knowledge about wonders not to be searched out. \\n\\n 42:4 [hgb] 求 你 听 我 ， 我 要 说 话 。 我 问 你 ， 求 你 指 示 我 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. \\n\\n [bbe] Give ear to me, and I will say what is in my mind; I will put questions to you, and you will give me the answers. \\n\\n 42:5 [hgb] 我 从 前 风 闻 有 你 ， 现 在 亲 眼 看 见 你 。 \\n\\n [kjv] I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee. \\n\\n [bbe] Word of you had come to my ears, but now my eye has seen you. \\n\\n 42:6 [hgb] 因 此 我 厌 恶 自 己 ， （ 自 己 或 作 我 的 言 语 ） 在 尘 土 和 炉 灰 中 懊 悔 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes. \\n\\n [bbe] For this cause I give witness that what I said is false, and in sorrow I take my seat in the dust. \\n\\n 42:7 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 约 伯 说 话 以 后 ， 就 对 提 幔 人 以 利 法 说 ， 我 的 怒 气 向 你 和 你 两 个 朋 友 发 作 ， 因 为 你 们 议 论 我 ， 不 如 我 的 仆 人 约 伯 说 的 是 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath. \\n\\n [bbe] And it came about, after he had said these words to Job, that the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite, I am very angry with you and your two friends, because you have not said what is right about me, as my servant Job has. \\n\\n 42:8 [hgb] 现 在 你 们 要 取 七 只 公 牛 ， 七 只 公 羊 ， 到 我 仆 人 约 伯 那 里 去 ， 为 自 己 献 上 燔 祭 ， 我 的 仆 人 约 伯 就 为 你 们 祈 祷 。 我 因 悦 纳 他 ， 就 不 按 你 们 的 愚 妄 办 你 们 。 你 们 议 论 我 ， 不 如 我 的 仆 人 约 伯 说 的 是 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job. \\n\\n [bbe] And now, take seven oxen and seven sheep, and go to my servant Job, and give a burned offering for yourselves, and my servant Job will make prayer for you, that I may not send punishment on you; because you have not said what is right about me, as my servant Job has. \\n\\n 42:9 [hgb] 于 是 提 幔 人 以 利 法 ， 书 亚 人 比 勒 达 ， 拿 玛 人 琐 法 照 着 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 的 去 行 。 耶 和 华 就 悦 纳 约 伯 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job. \\n\\n [bbe] And Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, went and did as the Lord had said. And the Lord gave ear to Job. \\n\\n 42:10 [hgb] 约 伯 为 他 的 朋 友 祈 祷 。 耶 和 华 就 使 约 伯 从 苦 境 转 回 （ 苦 境 原 文 作 掳 掠 ） ， 并 且 耶 和 华 赐 给 他 的 ， 比 他 从 前 所 有 的 加 倍 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before. \\n\\n [bbe] And the Lord made up to Job for all his losses, after he had made prayer for his friends: and all Job had before was increased by the Lord twice as much. \\n\\n 42:11 [hgb] 约 伯 的 弟 兄 ， 姐 妹 ， 和 以 先 所 认 识 的 人 都 来 见 他 ， 在 他 家 里 一 同 吃 饭 。 又 论 到 耶 和 华 所 降 与 他 的 一 切 灾 祸 ， 都 为 他 悲 伤 安 慰 他 。 每 人 也 送 他 一 块 银 子 和 一 个 金 环 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold. \\n\\n [bbe] And all his brothers and sisters, and his friends of earlier days, came and took food with him in his house; and made clear their grief for him, and gave him comfort for all the evil which the Lord had sent on him; and they all gave him a bit of money and a gold ring. \\n\\n 42:12 [hgb] 这 样 ， 耶 和 华 后 来 赐 福 给 约 伯 比 先 前 更 多 。 他 有 一 万 四 千 羊 ， 六 千 骆 驼 ， 一 千 对 牛 ， 一 千 母 驴 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses. \\n\\n [bbe] And the Lord\u0027s blessing was greater on the end of Job\u0027s life than on its start: and so he came to have fourteen thousand sheep and goats, and six thousand camels, and two thousand oxen, and a thousand she-asses. \\n\\n 42:13 [hgb] 他 也 有 七 个 儿 子 ， 三 个 女 儿 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He had also seven sons and three daughters. \\n\\n [bbe] And he had seven sons and three daughters. \\n\\n 42:14 [hgb] 他 给 长 女 起 名 叫 耶 米 玛 ， 次 女 叫 基 洗 亚 ， 三 女 叫 基 连 哈 朴 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch. \\n\\n [bbe] And he gave the first the name of Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch; \\n\\n 42:15 [hgb] 在 那 全 地 的 妇 女 中 ， 找 不 着 像 约 伯 的 女 儿 那 样 美 貌 。 她 们 的 父 亲 使 她 们 在 弟 兄 中 得 产 业 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren. \\n\\n [bbe] And there were no women so beautiful as the daughters of Job in all the earth: and their father gave them a heritage among their brothers. \\n\\n 42:16 [hgb] 此 后 ， 约 伯 又 活 了 一 百 四 十 年 ， 得 见 他 的 儿 孙 ， 直 到 四 代 。 \\n\\n [kjv] After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons\u0027 sons, even four generations. \\n\\n [bbe] And after this Job had a hundred and forty years of life, and saw his sons, and his sons\u0027 sons, even four generations. \\n\\n 42:17 [hgb] 这 样 ， 约 伯 年 纪 老 迈 ， 日 子 满 足 而 死 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So Job died, being old and full of days. \\n\\n [bbe] And Job came to his end, old and full of days. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114/1645.html","bookId":183,"book":{"id":183,"title":"约伯记 Job","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 乌 斯 地 有 一 个 人 名 叫 约 伯 。 那 人 完 全 正 直 ， 敬 畏 神 ， 远 离 恶 事 。 [kjv] There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared G...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
