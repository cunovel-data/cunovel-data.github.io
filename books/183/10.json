{"id":5708,"no":10,"title":"Chapter 10","content":"10:1 [hgb] 我 厌 烦 我 的 性 命 ， 必 由 着 自 己 述 说 我 的 哀 情 。 因 心 里 苦 恼 ， 我 要 说 话 。 \n [kjv] My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. \n [bbe] My soul is tired of life; I will let my sad thoughts go free in words; my soul will make a bitter outcry. \n 10:2 [hgb] 对 神 说 ， 不 要 定 我 有 罪 。 要 指 示 我 ， 你 为 何 与 我 争 辩 。 \n [kjv] I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me. \n [bbe] I will say to God, Do not put me down as a sinner; make clear to me what you have against me. \n 10:3 [hgb] 你 手 所 造 的 ， 你 又 欺 压 ， 又 藐 视 ， 却 光 照 恶 人 的 计 谋 。 这 事 你 以 为 美 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked? \n [bbe] What profit is it to you to be cruel, to give up the work of your hands, looking kindly on the design of evil-doers? \n 10:4 [hgb] 你 的 眼 岂 是 肉 眼 ， 你 查 看 岂 像 人 查 看 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth? \n [bbe] Have you eyes of flesh, or do you see as man sees? \n 10:5 [hgb] 你 的 日 子 岂 像 人 的 日 子 ， 你 的 年 岁 岂 像 人 的 年 岁 。 \n [kjv] Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man\u0027s days, \n [bbe] Are your days as the days of man, or your years like his, \n 10:6 [hgb] 就 追 问 我 的 罪 孽 ， 寻 察 我 的 罪 过 吗 ？ \n [kjv] That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin? \n [bbe] That you take note of my sin, searching after my wrongdoing, \n 10:7 [hgb] 其 实 ， 你 知 道 我 没 有 罪 恶 ， 并 没 有 能 救 我 脱 离 你 手 的 。 \n [kjv] Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand. \n [bbe] Though you see that I am not an evil-doer; and there is no one who is able to take a man out of your hands? \n 10:8 [hgb] 你 的 手 创 造 我 ， 造 就 我 的 四 肢 百 体 ， 你 还 要 毁 灭 我 。 \n [kjv] Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me. \n [bbe] Your hands made me, and I was formed by you, but then, changing your purpose, you gave me up to destruction. \n 10:9 [hgb] 求 你 记 念 制 造 我 如 抟 泥 一 般 ， 你 还 要 使 我 归 于 尘 土 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again? \n [bbe] O keep in mind that you made me out of earth; and will you send me back again to dust? \n 10:10 [hgb] 你 不 是 倒 出 我 来 好 像 奶 ， 使 我 凝 结 如 同 奶 饼 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese? \n [bbe] Was I not drained out like milk, becoming hard like cheese? \n 10:11 [hgb] 你 以 皮 和 肉 为 衣 给 我 穿 上 ， 用 骨 与 筋 把 我 全 体 联 络 。 \n [kjv] Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews. \n [bbe] By you I was clothed with skin and flesh, and joined together with bones and muscles. \n 10:12 [hgb] 你 将 生 命 和 慈 爱 赐 给 我 ， 你 也 眷 顾 保 全 我 的 心 灵 。 \n [kjv] Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit. \n [bbe] You have been kind to me, and your grace has been with me, and your care has kept my spirit safe. \n 10:13 [hgb] 然 而 ， 你 待 我 的 这 些 事 早 已 藏 在 你 心 里 ， 我 知 道 你 久 有 此 意 。 \n [kjv] And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this is with thee. \n [bbe] But you kept these things in the secret of your heart; I am certain this was in your thoughts: \n 10:14 [hgb] 我 若 犯 罪 ， 你 就 察 看 我 ， 并 不 赦 免 我 的 罪 孽 。 \n [kjv] If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity. \n [bbe] That, if I did wrong, you would take note of it, and would not make me clear from sin: \n 10:15 [hgb] 我 若 行 恶 ， 便 有 了 祸 。 我 若 为 义 ， 也 不 敢 抬 头 。 正 是 满 心 羞 愧 ， 眼 见 我 的 苦 情 。 \n [kjv] If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction; \n [bbe] That, if I was an evil-doer, the curse would come on me; and if I was upright, my head would not be lifted up, being full of shame and overcome with trouble. \n 10:16 [hgb] 我 若 昂 首 自 得 ， 你 就 追 捕 我 如 狮 子 ， 又 在 我 身 上 显 出 奇 能 。 \n [kjv] For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me. \n [bbe] And that if there was cause for pride, you would go after me like a lion; and again put out your wonders against me: \n 10:17 [hgb] 你 重 立 见 证 攻 击 我 ， 向 我 加 增 恼 怒 ， 如 军 兵 更 换 着 攻 击 我 。 \n [kjv] Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me. \n [bbe] That you would send new witnesses against me, increasing your wrath against me, and letting loose new armies on me. \n 10:18 [hgb] 你 为 何 使 我 出 母 胎 呢 ？ 不 如 我 当 时 气 绝 ， 无 人 得 见 我 。 \n [kjv] Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me! \n [bbe] Why then did you make me come out of my mother\u0027s body? It would have been better for me to have taken my last breath, and for no eye to have seen me, \n 10:19 [hgb] 这 样 ， 就 如 没 有 我 一 般 ， 一 出 母 胎 就 被 送 入 坟 墓 。 \n [kjv] I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave. \n [bbe] And for me to have been as if I had not been; to have been taken from my mother\u0027s body straight to my last resting-place. \n 10:20 [hgb] 我 的 日 子 不 是 甚 少 吗 ？ 求 你 停 手 宽 容 我 ， 叫 我 在 往 而 不 返 之 先 ， 就 是 往 黑 暗 ， 和 死 荫 之 地 以 先 ， 可 以 稍 得 畅 快 。 \n [kjv] Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little, \n [bbe] Are not the days of my life small in number? Let your eyes be turned away from me, so that I may have a little pleasure, \n 10:21 [hgb] \n [kjv] Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death; \n [bbe] Before I go to the place from which I will not come back, to the land where all is dark and black, \n 10:22 [hgb] 那 地 甚 是 幽 暗 ， 是 死 荫 混 沌 之 地 。 那 里 的 光 好 像 幽 暗 。 \n [kjv] A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness. \n [bbe] A land of thick dark, without order, where the very light is dark. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114/1613.html","bookId":183,"book":{"id":183,"title":"约伯记 Job","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 乌 斯 地 有 一 个 人 名 叫 约 伯 。 那 人 完 全 正 直 ， 敬 畏 神 ， 远 离 恶 事 。 [kjv] There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared G...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
