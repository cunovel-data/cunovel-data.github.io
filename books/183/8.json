{"id":5706,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"8:1 [hgb] 书 亚 人 比 勒 达 回 答 说 ， [kjv] Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, [bbe] Then Bildad the Shuhite made answer and said, 8:2 [hgb] 这 些 话 你 要 说 到 几 时 ？ 口 中 的 言 语 如 狂 风 要 到 几 时 呢 ？ [kjv] How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind? [bbe] How long will you say these things, and how long will the words of your mouth be like a strong wind? 8:3 [hgb] 神 岂 能 偏 离 公 平 ？ 全 能 者 岂 能 偏 离 公 义 ？ [kjv] Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice? [bbe] Does God give wrong decisions? or is the Ruler of all not upright in his judging? 8:4 [hgb] 或 者 你 的 儿 女 得 罪 了 他 ， 他 使 他 们 受 报 应 。 [kjv] If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression; [bbe] If your children have done evil against him, then their punishment is from his hand. 8:5 [hgb] 你 若 殷 勤 地 寻 求 神 ， 向 全 能 者 恳 求 。 [kjv] If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty; [bbe] If you will make search for God with care, and put your request before the Ruler of all; 8:6 [hgb] 你 若 清 洁 正 直 ， 他 必 定 为 你 起 来 ， 使 你 公 义 的 居 所 兴 旺 。 [kjv] If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous. [bbe] If you are clean and upright; then he will certainly be moved to take up your cause, and will make clear your righteousness by building up your house again. 8:7 [hgb] 你 起 初 虽 然 微 小 ， 终 久 必 甚 发 达 。 [kjv] Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase. [bbe] And though your start was small, your end will be very great. 8:8 [hgb] 请 你 考 问 前 代 ， 追 念 他 们 的 列 祖 所 查 究 的 。 [kjv] For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers: [bbe] Put the question now to the past generations, and give attention to what has been searched out by their fathers: 8:9 [hgb] （ 我 们 不 过 从 昨 日 才 有 ， 一 无 所 知 。 我 们 在 世 的 日 子 好 像 影 儿 。 ） [kjv] (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:) [bbe] (For we are but of yesterday, and have no knowledge, because our days on earth are gone like a shade:) 8:10 [hgb] 他 们 岂 不 指 教 你 ， 告 诉 你 ， 从 心 里 发 出 言 语 来 呢 ？ [kjv] Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart? [bbe] Will they not give you teaching, and say words of wisdom to you? 8:11 [hgb] 蒲 草 没 有 泥 ， 岂 能 发 长 ？ 芦 荻 没 有 水 ， 岂 能 生 发 ？ [kjv] Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water? [bbe] Will the river-plant come up in its pride without wet earth? will the grass get tall without water? 8:12 [hgb] 尚 青 的 时 候 ， 还 没 有 割 下 ， 比 百 样 的 草 先 枯 槁 。 [kjv] Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb. [bbe] When it is still green, without being cut down, it becomes dry and dead before any other plant. 8:13 [hgb] 凡 忘 记 神 的 人 ， 景 况 也 是 这 样 。 不 虔 敬 人 的 指 望 要 灭 没 。 [kjv] So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite\u0027s hope shall perish: [bbe] So is the end of all who do not keep God in mind; and the hope of the evil-doer comes to nothing: 8:14 [hgb] 他 所 仰 赖 的 必 折 断 ， 他 所 倚 靠 的 是 蜘 蛛 网 。 [kjv] Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider\u0027s web. [bbe] Whose support is cut off, and whose hope is no stronger than a spider\u0027s thread. 8:15 [hgb] 他 要 倚 靠 房 屋 ， 房 屋 却 站 立 不 住 。 他 要 抓 住 房 屋 ， 房 屋 却 不 能 存 留 。 [kjv] He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure. [bbe] He is looking to his family for support, but it is not there; he puts his hope in it, but it comes to nothing. 8:16 [hgb] 他 在 日 光 之 下 发 青 ， 蔓 子 爬 满 了 园 子 。 [kjv] He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden. [bbe] He is full of strength before the sun, and his branches go out over his garden. 8:17 [hgb] 他 的 根 盘 绕 石 堆 ， 扎 入 石 地 。 [kjv] His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones. [bbe] His roots are twisted round the stones, forcing their way in between them. 8:18 [hgb] 他 若 从 本 地 被 拔 出 ， 那 地 就 不 认 识 他 ， 说 ， 我 没 有 见 过 你 。 [kjv] If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee. [bbe] If he is taken away from his place, then it will say, I have not seen you. 8:19 [hgb] 看 哪 ， 这 就 是 他 道 中 之 乐 。 以 后 必 另 有 人 从 地 而 生 。 [kjv] Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow. [bbe] Such is the joy of his way, and out of the dust another comes up to take his place. 8:20 [hgb] 神 必 不 丢 弃 完 全 人 ， 也 不 扶 助 邪 恶 人 。 [kjv] Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers: [bbe] Truly, God will not give up him who is without sin, and will not take evil-doers by the hand. 8:21 [hgb] 他 还 要 以 喜 笑 充 满 你 的 口 ， 以 欢 呼 充 满 你 的 嘴 。 [kjv] Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing. [bbe] The time will come when your mouth will be full of laughing, and cries of joy will come from your lips. 8:22 [hgb] 恨 恶 你 的 要 披 戴 惭 愧 。 恶 人 的 帐 棚 ， 必 归 于 无 有 。 [kjv] They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought. [bbe] Your haters will be clothed with shame, and the tent of the sinner will not be seen again.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114/1611.html","bookId":183,"book":{"id":183,"title":"约伯记 Job","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 乌 斯 地 有 一 个 人 名 叫 约 伯 。 那 人 完 全 正 直 ， 敬 畏 神 ， 远 离 恶 事 。 [kjv] There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared G...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
