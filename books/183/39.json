{"id":5737,"no":39,"title":"Chapter 39","content":"39:1 [hgb] 山 岩 间 的 野 山 羊 几 时 生 产 ， 你 知 道 吗 ？ 母 鹿 下 犊 之 期 ， 你 能 察 定 吗 ？ [kjv] Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve? [bbe] Have you knowledge of the rock-goats? or do you see the roes giving birth to their young? 39:2 [hgb] 它 们 怀 胎 的 月 数 ， 你 能 数 算 吗 ？ 它 们 几 时 生 产 ， 你 能 晓 得 吗 ？ [kjv] Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth? [bbe] Is the number of their months fixed by you? or is the time when they give birth ordered by you? 39:3 [hgb] 它 们 屈 身 ， 将 子 生 下 ， 就 除 掉 疼 痛 。 [kjv] They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows. [bbe] They are bent down, they give birth to their young, they let loose the fruit of their body. 39:4 [hgb] 这 子 渐 渐 肥 壮 ， 在 荒 野 长 大 ， 去 而 不 回 。 [kjv] Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them. [bbe] Their young ones are strong, living in the open country; they go out and do not come back again. 39:5 [hgb] 谁 放 野 驴 出 去 自 由 。 谁 解 开 快 驴 的 绳 索 。 [kjv] Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass? [bbe] Who has let the ass of the fields go free? or made loose the bands of the loud-voiced beast? 39:6 [hgb] 我 使 旷 野 作 它 的 住 处 ， 使 咸 地 当 它 的 居 所 。 [kjv] Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings. [bbe] To whom I have given the waste land for a heritage, and the salt land as a living-place. 39:7 [hgb] 它 嗤 笑 城 内 的 喧 嚷 ， 不 听 赶 牲 口 的 喝 声 。 [kjv] He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver. [bbe] He makes sport of the noise of the town; the voice of the driver does not come to his ears; 39:8 [hgb] 遍 山 是 它 的 草 场 。 它 寻 找 各 样 青 绿 之 物 。 [kjv] The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing. [bbe] He goes looking for his grass-lands in the mountains, searching out every green thing. 39:9 [hgb] 野 牛 岂 肯 服 事 你 。 岂 肯 住 在 你 的 槽 旁 。 [kjv] Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib? [bbe] Will the ox of the mountains be your servant? or is his night\u0027s resting-place by your food-store? 39:10 [hgb] 你 岂 能 用 套 绳 将 野 牛 笼 在 犁 沟 之 间 。 它 岂 肯 随 你 耙 山 谷 之 地 。 [kjv] Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee? [bbe] Will he be pulling your plough with cords, turning up the valleys after you? 39:11 [hgb] 岂 可 因 它 的 力 大 就 倚 靠 它 。 岂 可 把 你 的 工 交 给 它 做 吗 ？ [kjv] Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him? [bbe] Will you put your faith in him, because his strength is great? will you give the fruit of your work into his care? 39:12 [hgb] 岂 可 信 靠 它 把 你 的 粮 食 运 到 家 ， 又 收 聚 你 禾 场 上 的 谷 吗 ？ [kjv] Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn? [bbe] Will you be looking for him to come back, and get in your seed to the crushing-floor? 39:13 [hgb] 鸵 鸟 的 翅 膀 欢 然 扇 展 ， 岂 是 显 慈 爱 的 翎 毛 和 羽 毛 吗 ？ [kjv] Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich? [bbe] Is the wing of the ostrich feeble, or is it because she has no feathers, 39:14 [hgb] 因 它 把 蛋 留 在 地 上 ， 在 尘 土 中 使 得 温 暖 。 [kjv] Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust, [bbe] That she puts her eggs on the earth, warming them in the dust, 39:15 [hgb] 却 想 不 到 被 脚 踹 碎 ， 或 被 野 兽 践 踏 。 [kjv] And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them. [bbe] Without a thought that they may be crushed by the foot, and broken by the beasts of the field? 39:16 [hgb] 它 忍 心 待 雏 ， 似 乎 不 是 自 己 的 。 虽 然 徒 受 劳 苦 ， 也 不 为 雏 惧 怕 。 [kjv] She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers: her labour is in vain without fear; [bbe] She is cruel to her young ones, as if they were not hers; her work is to no purpose; she has no fear. 39:17 [hgb] 因 为 神 使 它 没 有 智 慧 ， 也 未 将 悟 性 赐 给 它 。 [kjv] Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding. [bbe] For God has taken wisdom from her mind, and given her no measure of knowledge. 39:18 [hgb] 它 几 时 挺 身 展 开 翅 膀 ， 就 嗤 笑 马 和 骑 马 的 人 。 [kjv] What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider. [bbe] When she is shaking her wings on high, she makes sport of the horse and of him who is seated on him. 39:19 [hgb] 马 的 大 力 是 你 所 赐 的 吗 ？ 它 颈 项 上 ？ ？ 挲 的 鬃 是 你 给 它 披 上 的 吗 ？ [kjv] Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder? [bbe] Do you give strength to the horse? is it by your hand that his neck is clothed with power? 39:20 [hgb] 是 你 叫 它 跳 跃 像 蝗 虫 吗 ？ 它 喷 气 之 威 使 人 惊 惶 。 [kjv] Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible. [bbe] Is it through you that he is shaking like a locust, in the pride of his loud-sounding breath? 39:21 [hgb] 它 在 谷 中 刨 地 ， 自 喜 其 力 。 它 出 去 迎 接 佩 带 兵 器 的 人 。 [kjv] He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men. [bbe] He is stamping with joy in the valley; he makes sport of fear. 39:22 [hgb] 它 嗤 笑 可 怕 的 事 并 不 惊 惶 ， 也 不 因 刀 剑 退 回 。 [kjv] He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword. [bbe] In his strength he goes out against the arms of war, turning not away from the sword. 39:23 [hgb] 箭 袋 和 发 亮 的 枪 ， 并 短 枪 在 它 身 上 铮 铮 有 声 。 [kjv] The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield. [bbe] The bow is sounding against him; he sees the shining point of spear and arrow. 39:24 [hgb] 它 发 猛 烈 的 怒 气 将 地 吞 下 。 一 听 角 声 就 不 耐 站 立 。 [kjv] He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet. [bbe] Shaking with passion, he is biting the earth; he is not able to keep quiet at the sound of the horn; 39:25 [hgb] 角 每 发 声 ， 它 说 呵 哈 。 它 从 远 处 闻 着 战 气 ， 又 听 见 军 长 大 发 雷 声 ， 和 兵 丁 呐 喊 。 [kjv] He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting. [bbe] When it comes to his ears he says, Aha! He is smelling the fight from far off, and hearing the thunder of the captains, and the war-cries. 39:26 [hgb] 鹰 雀 飞 翔 ， 展 开 翅 膀 一 直 向 南 ， 岂 是 借 你 的 智 慧 吗 ？ [kjv] Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south? [bbe] Is it through your knowledge that the hawk takes his flight, stretching out his wings to the south? 39:27 [hgb] 大 鹰 上 腾 在 高 处 搭 窝 ， 岂 是 听 你 的 吩 咐 吗 ？ [kjv] Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high? [bbe] Or is it by your orders that the eagle goes up, and makes his resting-place on high? 39:28 [hgb] 它 住 在 山 岩 ， 以 山 峰 和 坚 固 之 所 为 家 ， [kjv] She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place. [bbe] On the rock is his house, and on the mountain-top his strong place. 39:29 [hgb] 从 那 里 窥 看 食 物 ， 眼 睛 远 远 观 望 。 [kjv] From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off. [bbe] From there he is watching for food; his eye sees it far off. 39:30 [hgb] 它 的 雏 也 咂 血 。 被 杀 的 人 在 哪 里 。 它 也 在 哪 里 。 [kjv] Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she. [bbe] His young have blood for their drink, and where the dead bodies are, there is he to be seen.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114/1642.html","bookId":183,"book":{"id":183,"title":"约伯记 Job","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 乌 斯 地 有 一 个 人 名 叫 约 伯 。 那 人 完 全 正 直 ， 敬 畏 神 ， 远 离 恶 事 。 [kjv] There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared G...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/114","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
