{"id":32659,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II. THE CALL TO SCHOOL.","content":"Fred Sheldon, as I have said, is the hero of this story. He was twelve years of age, the picture of rosy health, good nature, bounding spirits and mental strength. He was bright and well advanced in his studies, and as is generally the case with such vigorous youngsters he was fond of fun, which too often, perhaps, passed the line of propriety and became mischief. On the Monday morning after the fight, which Fred Sheldon interrupted, some ten or twelve boys stopped on their way to the Tottenville Public School to admire in open-mouthed wonder, the gorgeous pictures pasted on a huge framework of boards, put up for the sole purpose of making such a display. These flaming posters were devoted to setting forth the unparalleled attractions of Bandman\u0027s great menagerie and circus, which was announced to appear in the well-known \"Hart\u0027s Half-Acre,\" near the village of Tottenville. These scenes, in which elephants, tigers, leopards, camels, sacred cows, and indeed an almost endless array of animals were shown on a scale that indicated they were as high as a meeting-house, in which the serpents,[Pg 10] it unwound from the trees where they were crushing men and beasts to death, would have stretched across \"Hart\u0027s Half-Acre\" (which really contained several acres), those frightful encounters, in which a man, single-handed, was seen to be spreading death and destruction with a clubbed gun among the fierce denizens of the forest; all these had been displayed on the side of barns and covered bridges, at the cross-roads, and indeed in every possible available space for the past three weeks; and, as the date of the great show was the one succeeding that of which we are speaking, it can be understood that the little village of Tottenville and the surrounding country were in a state of excitement such as had not been known since the advent of the preceding circus. Regularly every day the school children had stopped in front of the huge bill-board and studied and admired and talked over the great show, while those who expected to go in the afternoon or evening looked down in pity on their less fortunate playmates. The interest seemed to intensify as the day approached, and, now that it was so close at hand, the little group found it hard to tear themselves away from the fascinating scenes before them. Down in one corner of the board was the picture of a hyena desecrating a cemetery, as it is well known those animals are fond of doing. This bad creature, naturally enough, became very distasteful to the boys, who showed their ill-will in many ways. Several almost ruined their new shoes by kicking him, while others had pelted him with stones, and still others,[Pg 11] in face of the warning printed in big letters, had haggled him dreadfully with their jack-knives. It was a warm summer morning and most of the boys not only were bare-footed, but had their trousers rolled above their knees, and, generally, were without coat or vest. \"To-morrow afternoon the show will be here,\" said Sammy McClay, smacking his lips and shaking his head as though he tasted a luscious morsel, \"and I\u0027m going.\" \"How are you going,\" asked Joe Hunt, sarcastically, \"when your father said he wouldn\u0027t give you the money?\" \"Never you mind,\" was the answer, with another significant shake of the head. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027—that\u0027s all.\" \"Goin\u0027 to try and crawl under the tent. I know. But you can\u0027t do it. You\u0027ll get a whack from the whip of the man that\u0027s watching that you\u0027ll feel for six weeks. Don\u0027t I know—\u0027cause, didn\u0027t I try it?\" \"I wouldn\u0027t be such a dunce as you; you got half way under the tent and then stuck fast, so you couldn\u0027t go backward or forward, and you begun to yell so you like to broke up the performance, and when the man come along why he had the best chance in the world to cowhide you, and he did it. I think I know a little better than that.\" At this moment, Mr. Abijah McCurtis, the school teacher in the little stone school-house a hundred yards away, solemnly lifted his spectacles from his nose to his forehead, and grasping the handle of his large cracked bell walked to the door and swayed it vigorously for a minute or so. [Pg 12] This was the regular summons for the boys and girls to enter school, and he had sent forth the unmusical clangor, summer and winter, for a full two-score years. Having called the pupils together, the pedagogue sat down, drew his spectacles back astride of his nose, and resumed setting copies in the books which had been laid on his desk the day before. In a minute or so the boys and girls came straggling in, but the experienced eye of the teacher saw that several were missing. Looking through the open door he discovered where the four delinquent urchins were; they were still standing in front of the great showy placards, studying the enchanting pictures, as they had done so many times before. They were all talking earnestly, Sammy McClay, Joe Hunt, Jimmy Emery and Fred Sheldon, and they had failed for the first time in their lives to hear the cracked bell. Most teachers, we are bound to believe, would have called the boys a second time or sent another lad to notify them, but the present chance was one of those which, unfortunately, the old-time pedagogue was glad to have, and Mr. McCurtis seized it with pleasure. Rising from his seat, he picked up from where it lay across his desk a long, thin switch, and started toward the four barefooted lads, who were admiring the circus pictures. Nothing could have been more inviting, for, not only were they barefooted, but each had his trousers rolled to[Pg 13] the knee, and Fred Sheldon had drawn and squeezed his so far that they could go no further. His plump, clean legs offered the most inviting temptation to the teacher, who was one of those sour old pedagogues, of the long ago, who delighted in seeing children tortured under the guise of so-called discipline. \"I don\u0027t believe in wearing trousers in warm weather,\" said Fred, when anybody looked wonderingly to see whether he really had such useful garments on, \"and that\u0027s why I roll mine so high up. Don\u0027t you see I\u0027m ready to run into the water, and——\" \"How about going through the bushes and briars?\" asked Joe Hunt. \"I don\u0027t go through \u0027em,\" was the crushing answer. \"I feel so supple and limber that I just jump right over the top. I tell you, boys, that you ought to see me jump——\" Fred\u0027s wish was gratified, for at that moment he gave such an exhibition of jumping as none of his companions had ever seen before. With a shout he sprang high in air, kicking out his bare legs in a frantic way, and ran with might and main for the school-house. The other three lads did pretty much the same, for the appearance of the teacher among them was made known by the whizzing hiss of his long, slender switch, which first landed on Fred\u0027s legs, and was then quickly transferred to the lower limbs of the other boys, the little company immediately heading for the school house, with Fred Sheldon at the front. Each one shouted, and made a high and frantic leap[Pg 14] every few steps, believing that the teacher was close behind him with upraised stick, and looking for the chance to bring it down with effect. \"I\u0027ll teach you not to stand gaping at those pictures,\" shouted Mr. McCurtis, striding wrathfully after them. A man three-score years old cannot be expected to be as active as a boy with one-fifth as many years; but the teacher had the advantage of being very tall and quite attenuated, and for a short distance he could outrun any of his pupils. The plump, shapely legs of Fred Sheldon, twinkling and doubling under him as he ran, seemed to be irresistibly tempting to Mr. McCurtis, who, with upraised switch, dashed for him like a thunder-gust, paying no attention to the others, who ducked aside as he passed. \"It\u0027s your fault, you young scapegrace,\" called out the pursuer, as he rapidly overhauled him; \"you haven\u0027t been thinking of anything else but circuses for the past month and I mean to whip it out of you—good gracious sakes!\" Fred Sheldon had seen how rapidly the teacher was gaining, and finding there was no escape, resorted to the common trick among boys of suddenly falling flat on his face while running at full speed. The cruel-hearted teacher at that very moment made a savage stroke, intending to raise a ridge on the flesh of the lad, who escaped it by a hair\u0027s breadth, as may be said. The spiteful blow spent itself in vacancy, and the momentum spun Mr. McCurtis around on one foot, so that[Pg 15] he faced the other way. At that instant his heels struck the prostrate form of the crouching boy, and he went over, landing upon his back, his legs pointing upward, like a pair of huge dividers. There is nothing a boy perceives so quickly as a chance for fun, and before the teacher could rise, Sammy McClay also went tumbling over the grinning Fred Sheldon, with such violence, indeed, that he struck the bewildered instructor as he was trying to adjust his spectacles to see where he was. Then came Joe Hunt and Jimmy Emery, and Fred Sheldon capped the climax by running at full speed and jumping on the struggling group, spreading out his arms and legs in the effort to bear them down to the earth. But the difficulty was that Fred was not very heavy nor bony, so that his presence on top caused very little inconvenience, the teacher rising so hurriedly that Fred fell from his shoulders, and landed on his head when he struck the earth. The latter was dented, but Fred wasn\u0027t hurt at all, and he and his friends scrambled hastily into the school-house, where the other children were in an uproar, fairly dancing with delight at the exhibition, or rather \"circus,\" as some of them called it, which took place before the school-house and without any expense to them. By the time the discomfited teacher had got upon his feet and shaken himself together, the four lads were in school, busily engaged in scratching their legs and studying their lessons. [Pg 16] Mr. McCurtis strode in a minute later switch in hand, and in such a grim mood that he could only quiet his nerves by walking around the room and whipping every boy in it. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3290/89939.html","bookId":461,"book":{"id":461,"title":"A Young Hero","description":"简介： A fight!
