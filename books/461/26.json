{"id":32683,"no":26,"title":"HANSCHEN AND THE HARES. FROM THE GERMAN, BY ELLEN T. SULLIVAN.","content":"Long ago, in a little house near a forest in Germany lived a shoemaker and his wife. They were poor but contented and happy; for they were willing to work and they had their snug little house and food enough for themselves and their little Hanschens. \"Oh! if Hanschen would only grow like other boys, I should be the happiest woman in the land,\" the mother used to say. \"He is six years old, yet he can stand on the palm of my hand.\" \"Well, if he is not so big as some of our neighbors\u0027 boys, he is brighter than many of them,\" the father used to answer. Then the mother felt so glad she would dance around the room with Hans and say, \"Yes, he is bright as a child can be and as spry too. When he runs around the room I can hardly catch him.\" One day she said to her husband, \"I am going to the forest meadow to cut fodder for the goat. The grass[Pg 276] there is so sweet and juicy that, if the goat eats it, we shall have the richest milk for Hanschen. That will make him grow faster. I will take him with me; he can sit in the grass and play with the flowers.\" \"Very well,\" said the father; \"take care that he does not stray away from you. Give him some clover blossoms to suck. We are too poor to buy candy for him.\" Out through the green forest went Hanschen and his mother. The boy was so happy that his mother could hardly hold him, as he laughed and jumped and clapped his hands. He thought the blue sky was playing hide-and-seek with him through the treetops; that the birds were singing a welcome to him, and that the bees, the butterflies, and great dragon-flies were all glad to see him. When they came to the meadow his mother put him down and gave him some clover blossoms. Then she began to cut the grass and soon she was quite a way from Hanschen, who was entirely hidden by the tall grass. While the mother was working Hanschen sat sucking his sweet clover blossoms. All at once he heard a rustling, and there, beside him were two little hares. He was not at all afraid. He nodded to them and said, \"How do you do?\" The little hares had never seen a child. They thought he was a hare, dressed up in a coat and having a different kind of face from their own.[Pg 277] They stared at him a minute and then one said, \"Hop! hop!\" and sprang over a grass stalk. \"Can you do that?\" said they to Hanschen. \"Yes, indeed!\" said he, leaping quickly over a stalk, as he spoke. \"Now,\" said the hares, \"we shall have a fine time playing together.\" And a fine time they did have, leaping and racing until the sun was low in the west, and the little hares began to think of supper and bed. \"Come home with us; our father and mother will be good to you;\" they said to Hanschen. So he leaped away with the little hares toward the green bushes where they lived. Now there was another little hare, who had staid at home with his mother that day. His bright eyes were the first to see the three merry friends leaping toward the bushes. \"Oh, mammy! mammy!\" he cried: \"Just look through the bushes. Did you ever see such a queer-looking hare as that little chap with my brothers?\" \"Bring me my spectacles, child,\" said Mrs. Hare. \"It may be the poor thing has been hurt. That terrible hunter is around again. He chased your poor father yesterday. Then that wicked old fox is prowling about, too. It may be that one of them hurt the poor little stranger so that he does not look natural. If so, I\u0027ll soon cure him by good nursing.\" That was what kind Mrs. Hare said to her little son. He brought her spectacles, which she wiped and put on. [Pg 278] Then she cried out, \"Why bless me! this is no hare! This is a human child! He is lost and his parents will be wild with grief for him. My children, I fear you led him astray. Tell just where you found him and we will carry him back there in the morning. It is so late now he must stay with us to-night.\" \"We thought he was a hare because he can spring and leap as well as we can. We found him in the forest meadow and we have had splendid fun together,\" said the little hares. Then good Mrs. Hare gave Hanschen some hares\u0027 bread for his supper, and soon after she tucked him snugly in bed with her sons. Before putting him to bed she drew over him, a soft silky hare coat. It fitted him nicely from the two furry ears to the little stubby tail. The three little hares were delighted and said, \"He\u0027s a hare now, isn\u0027t he, mammy?\" \"Well, dears, he does look just like one of you; but you must all lie still now and go to sleep for we must get up with the sun, to-morrow,\" said Mrs. Hare. In the meantime Hanschen\u0027s mother had finished cutting the grass, and she looked for Hanschen and called him until it grew quite dark. Then she went home, weeping bitterly, and told her husband that their child was lost. Out ran the father then to look for his boy; but he could not find him. All that night the poor parents wept and moaned, while Hanschen was sleeping peacefully with the little hares. [Pg 279] The Hare family got up at daylight, and all of them put on their Sunday clothes, for Mr. Hare had said to his wife, \"I want folks to see that their child has been with good company; so please put on your very best cap and brush all our children\u0027s coats until they shine. I\u0027ll wear a high collar and my tall silk hat, and you must tie my cravat in a nice bow.\" When all were dressed they ate a good breakfast, locked up their green gate and started for the meadow. They had scarcely reached the edge of the forest, when they heard Hanschen\u0027s mother calling, \"Hanschen! Hanschen! darling!\" \"Here I am, mother;\" cried he. \"I hear him! I hear him! Oh husband! don\u0027t you?\" said the mother. \"I do hear his voice but I can see nothing except a little brown hare.\" Hanschen laughed in delight—sprang forward and pulled off his furry coat. How surprised his father and mother were! By this time the Hare family had come up and Mr. Hare took off his hat and bowing very low, he said, \"Mr. Man, this is my good wife and these youngsters are my three sons. Their mother and I try to teach them to do right, and they really are pretty good children. Two of them were playing around here yesterday, and invited your son to play with them, not knowing what sorrow and trouble they caused you by leading him astray. They brought him home with them last night. My good wife gave him plenty to eat;[Pg 280] he slept with my sons and you see the fine suit of hare-clothes he has just taken off. I hope you will let him keep it to remember us by. It is a present from all of us. We are only hares but we have done by your child just what we should like you to do by one of our children if you should find one of them astray. And now, my dear sir, we will bid you farewell and go back to our home.\" \"Not yet! not yet!\" cried Hanschen\u0027s father and mother. \"Tell us, do you have sorrows or troubles? One good turn deserves another. We should be so glad to do something for you.\" \"Sorrows and troubles are plentiful in our lives,\" said Mr. Hare. \"If you can stop that terrible hunter from chasing us; and if you can manage to trap that wicked Mr. Fox, will make us very happy. And good Mrs. Man, if you will just throw a few cabbage leaves out on the snow for us in the winter, when every green thing is dead or buried; then we shall not have to go to bed hungry.\" Hanschen\u0027s father and mother gladly promised to do all they could for the good Hare family; then the two happy families went home. One day soon after Hanschen\u0027s visit to the hares, his father got up very early, for he had two pairs of shoes to finish that day. He had scarcely begun his work when a very loud knock was heard at the door. \"Who[Pg 281] can it be so early as this?\" thought the shoemaker. He opened the door and there stood—Mr. Fox! \"Good morning, shoemaker,\" said he; \"I want you to make me a pair of shoes and do it right off, too, or I\u0027ll kill every one of your hens to-night. I\u0027m hare hunting, to-day. I know where a whole family of hares live, down near the forest. I mean to bag them all before they leave their house this morning. They run so fast it is hard to catch them when they are out. But, see one of my shoes is torn, so I must have a new pair before I can walk so far.\" The shoemaker bowed and invited the fox to come in and sit down. Then he said, \"Mr. Fox, a great hunter like you ought to wear high boots; not low shoes like common folks.\" That pleased Mr. Fox, so he said, \"Well, make high boots; but make them of the finest, softest leather, and do not make them tight.\" The shoemaker took the hardest, heaviest, leather he could find and soon finished the boots. He put a piece of sticky wax into each boot. He said to himself, \"Mr. Fox thinks he is very sly but we\u0027ll see whether he can catch our friends, the hares, when he puts on these boots.\" Mr. Fox proudly drew on his boots but he said: \"They seem stiff and tight. I fear I cannot run very fast in them.\" \"Just wait till you have worn them a little while—new boots generally feel stiff,\" said the shoemaker. [Pg 282] \"Well, I will hurry off now; but I\u0027ll soon come back and bring you the hares\u0027 skins to pay for the boots,\" said Mr. Fox. A little while after the fox had gone the shoemaker\u0027s wife jumped up in alarm from her chair. A hare had leaped in through the window behind her. It was one of their friends—the father of the Hare family. \"Save me! the hunter is after me,\" he cried. \"Here, quick! jump into bed,\" said the shoemaker\u0027s wife. He did so, and she covered him up, then she dressed Hanschen in the suit that the hares had given him. She had scarcely done so when the hunter came in and said, \"Give me the hare that I have been chasing. I saw him leap into your window. I must have him. There he is now, springing on your table.\" \"There is my little Hanschen,\" said the shoemaker. \"No wonder you think he is a hare, for he can run as fast and leap as well as any hare.\" \"Yes,\" said Hanschen\u0027s mother, \"and he often goes out to play in this hare-suit—see how nicely it fits him. But, Mr. Hunter, you must not shoot my Hanschen when you are out chasing hares.\" \"Well,\" said the hunter, \"if that isn\u0027t wonderful. But say, good people, how in the world am I to know whether I am chasing Hanschen or a hare?\" \"Oh, easily enough,\" said the shoemaker. \"You have only to wait a minute and call out, \u0027Hanschen!\u0027 If the little[Pg 283] creature sits up still and straight like a child, don\u0027t shoot, for that will be Hanschen.\" \"I will remember and call out,\" said the hunter. \"Well, then, to pay you for your kindness, I\u0027ll tell you that if you hurry toward the forest, now, you will be able to bag a fox that cannot be far away; for the rogue has on a pair of boots of my making, and he has hard work to move with them by this time, I\u0027ll be bound.\" \"Thank you, Mr. Shoemaker,\" said the hunter; \"I\u0027ll soon finish him and bring you his hide to prove it. Only last night he killed three of my hens.\" The hunter soon caught up with the fox, brought his hide to the shoemaker and went away. Then Hanschen\u0027s father told the hare to go home to his folks and tell them that the old fox would never trouble them again, and when they heard the hunter they were just to sit still and straight on their hind legs. Mr. Hare flew over the ground on his way home. His good news made him light-hearted and swift-footed. Oh, how happy the hares were! To this day hares often sit up like a child. Hanschen often spent a day with the hares, and learned to run so well, and spring forward so quickly, that all the people said when he grew up, \"He is the best man to have for a postman for the villages around.\" So Hanschen became postman. He never forgot his[Pg 284] friends, the hares, but always carried some cabbage leaves for them when snow and ice covered up or killed the green leaves. \u0027Tis said the hares used to watch for his coming, and sing this song when they caught sight of him: \"Our good friend, Hans, Is a brave young man; hip, hurrah! He springs as well As the best hare can; hip, hurrah! Beneath his coat Is a good, warm heart; hip, hurrah! We may be sure He will take our part; hip, hurrah! We need not starve Though the world be white; hip, hurrah! Our good friend, Hans Will give us a bite; hip, hurrah! This is his time He is drawing near; hip, hurrah! Off with hats; now","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3290/89963.html","bookId":461,"book":{"id":461,"title":"A Young Hero","description":"简介： A fight! A fight! Form a ring!
