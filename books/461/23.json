{"id":32680,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII. THE SILVERWARE RETURNED.","content":"The sabbath morning dawned cool, breezy and delightful, and the maiden twin sisters, Misses Annie and Lizzie Perkinpine, made their preparations for driving to the village church, just as they had been in the habit of doing for many years. It required a storm of unusual violence to keep them from the Sunday service, which was more edifying to the good souls than any worldly entertainment could have been. They were not among those whose health permits them to attend secular amusements, but who invariably feel \"indisposed\" when their spiritual duties are involved. \"I was afraid, sister,\" said Annie, \"that when our silver was stolen, the loss would weigh so heavily upon me that I would not be able to enjoy the church service as much as usual, but I am thankful that it made no difference with me; how was it with you?\" \"I could not help feeling disturbed for some days,\" was the reply, \"for it was a loss indeed, but, when we have so much to be grateful for, how wrong it is to repine——\" \"What\u0027s that?\" interrupted the other, hastening to[Pg 242] the window as she heard the rattle of carriage wheels; \"some one is coming here as sure as I live.\" \"The folks must have forgot that it is the Sabbath,\" was the grieved remark of the other. \"But this is something out of the common. Heigho!\" This exclamation was caused by the sight of Cyrus Sutton, as he leaped lightly out of the wagon and tied his horse, while Fred Sheldon seemed to be tugging at something on the floor of the vehicle, which resisted his efforts. Mr. Sutton, having fastened the horse, went to the help of the youngster, and the next moment the two approached the house bearing a considerable burden. \"My gracious!\" exclaimed Aunt Lizzie, throwing up her hands, and ready to sink to the floor in her astonishment; \"they have got our silverware.\" \"You are right,\" added her sister, \"they have the whole six pieces, slop-jar, sugar bowl, cream pitcher—not one of the six missing. They have them all; now we can go to church and enjoy the sermon more than ever.\" The massive service of solid silver quaintly fashioned and carved by the puffy craftsmen of Amsterdam, who wrought and toiled when sturdy old Von Tromp was pounding the British tars off Goodwin Sands, more than two centuries ago, was carried into the house with considerable effort and set on the dining-room table, while for a minute or two the owners could do nothing but clasp and unclasp their hands and utter exclamations of wonder and thankfulness that the invaluable heirlooms had at last come back to them. [Pg 243] The detective and lad looked smilingly at the ladies, hardly less pleased than they. \"Where did you find them?\" asked Aunt Lizzie, addressing herself directly to Mr. Carter, as was natural for her to do. The detective pointed to the boy and said: \"Ask him.\" \"Why, what can Fred know about it?\" inquired the lady, beaming kindly upon the blushing lad. \"He knows everything, for it was not I, but he, who found them.\" \"Why, Fred, how can that be?\" \"I found them in an old tree in the woods,\" replied the little fellow, blushing to his ears. \"This gentleman helped me to bring them here, for I never could have lugged them alone.\" \"Of course you couldn\u0027t, but since you have earned the reward, you shall have it. To-day is the holy Sabbath, and it would be wrong, therefore, to engage in any business, but come around early to-morrow morning and we will be ready.\" \"And I want to say,\" said Aunt Annie, pinching the chubby cheek of the happy youngster, \"that there isn\u0027t any one in the whole world that we would rather give the reward to than you.\" \"And there is none that it will please me more to see receive it,\" was the cordial remark of Mr. Carter, who, respecting the scruples of the good ladies, was about to bid them good-morning, when Aunt Lizzie, walking to the window, said: [Pg 244] \"I wonder what is keeping Michael.\" \"I am afraid he will not be here to-day,\" said the officer. \"Why not?\" asked the sisters together in astonishment. \"Well, to tell you the truth, he is in trouble.\" \"Why, what has Michael done.\" \"Nothing himself, but do you remember the tramp who came here last Monday night, and, after eating at your table, stole, or rather helped to steal, your silver service?\" \"Of course we remember him.\" \"Well, that tramp was Michael\u0027s son Bud, who had put on false whiskers and disguised himself so that you never suspected who he was. Bud is a bad boy and is now in jail.\" \"What is the world coming to?\" gasped Aunt Lizzie, sinking into a chair with clasped hands, while her sister was no less shocked. In their kindness of heart they would have been glad to lose a large part of the precious silverware could it have been the means of restoring the boy to honesty and innocence. But that was impossible, and the sisters could only grieve over the depravity of one whom they had trusted. They asked nothing about the money that was taken with the silver, but Mr. Carter handed more than one-half of the sum to them. \"Bud had spent considerable, but he gave me this; Kincade declared that he hadn\u0027t a penny left, but I don\u0027t believe him; this will considerably decrease your loss.\" [Pg 245] At this moment, there was a resounding knock on the door, and in response to the summons to enter, Archie Jackson appeared, very red in the face and puffing hard. Bowing hastily to the ladies, he said impatiently to the officer: \"It seems to me you\u0027re deef.\" \"Why so?\" \"I\u0027ve been chasing and yelling after you for half a mile, but you either pretended you didn\u0027t hear me or maybe you didn\u0027t.\" \"I assure you, Archie, that I would have stopped on the first call, if I had heard you, for you know how glad I am always to have your company, and how little we could have done without your help.\" The detective knew how to mollify the fussy constable, whose face flushed a still brighter red, under the compliments of his employer, as he may be termed. \"I knowed you was coming here,\" explained Archie, \"and so I come along, so as to vouch to these ladies for you.\" \"You are very kind, but they seem to be satisfied with Master Fred\u0027s indorsement, for he has the reputation of being a truthful lad.\" \"I\u0027m glad to hear it; how far, may I ask,\" he continued, clearing his throat, \"have you progressed in the settlement of the various questions and complications arising from the nefarious transaction on Monday evening last?\" \"The plate has been returned to the ladies, as your eyes must have told you; but, since this is the first day[Pg 246] of the week, the reward will not be handed over to Fred until to-morrow morning. \"Accept my congratulations, sir, accept my congratulations,\" said the constable, stepping ardently toward the boy and effusively extending his hand. The ladies declined to accept the money which the detective offered, insisting that it belonged to him. He complied with their wishes, and, since it was evident that Archie had hastened over solely to make sure he was not forgotten in the general distribution of wages, the detective handed him one hundred dollars, which was received with delight, since it was far more than the constable had ever earned in such a short time in all his life before. \"Before I leave,\" said Mr. Carter, addressing the ladies, \"I must impress one important truth upon you.\" \"You mean about the sin of stealing,\" said Aunt Annie; \"Oh, we have thought a good deal about that.\" The officer smiled in spite of himself, but quickly became serious again. \"You mistake me. I refer to your practice of keeping such valuable plate as loosely as you have been in the habit of doing for so many years. The fact of the robbery will cause it to be generally known that your silver can be had by any one who chooses to enter your house and take it, and you may rest assured, that if you leave it exposed it won\u0027t be long before it will vanish again, beyond the reach of all the Fred Sheldons and detectives in the United States.\" \"Your words are wise,\" said Aunt Annie, \"and I[Pg 247] have made up my mind that we must purchase two or three more locks and put them on the chest.\" \"I think I know a better plan than that,\" Aunt Lizzie hastened to say. \"What\u0027s that?\" inquired the visitor. \"We\u0027ll get Michael to bring some real heavy stones to the house and place them on the lid of the chest, so as to hold it down.\" \"Neither of your plans will work,\" said Mr. Carter solemnly; \"you must either place your silver in the bank, where you can get it whenever you wish, or you must buy a burglar-proof safe and lock it up in that every night.\" \"I have heard of such things,\" said Aunt Lizzie, \"and I think we will procure a safe, for it is more pleasant to know that the silver is in the house than it is to have it in the bank, miles off, where it will be so hard to take and bring it. What do you think, sister?\" \"The same as you do.\" \"Then we will buy the safe.\" \"And until you do so, the silver must be deposited in the bank; though, as this is Sunday, you will have to keep it in the house until the morrow.\" \"I shall not feel afraid to do that,\" was the serene response of sister Lizzie, \"because no man, even if he is wicked enough to be a robber, would be so abandoned as to commit the crime on Sunday.\" The beautiful faith of the good soul was not shocked by any violent results of her trust. Though the silver remained in her house during the rest of that day and[Pg 248] the following night, it was not disturbed, and on the morrow was safely delivered to the bank, where it stayed until the huge safe was set up in the old mansion, in which the precious stuff was deposited, and where at this writing it still remains, undisturbed by any wicked law-breakers. You may not know it, but it is a fact that there are circuses traveling over the country to-day whose ticket-sellers receive no wages at all, because they rely upon the short change and the bad money which they can work off on their patrons. Not only that, but I know of a case where a man paid twenty dollars monthly for the privilege of selling tickets for a circus. From this statement, I must except any and all enterprises with which my old friend, P. T. Barnum, has any connection. Nothing could induce him to countenance such dishonesty. Trained in this pernicious school, Jacob Kincade did not hesitate to launch out more boldly, and finally he formed a partnership with two other knaves, for the purpose of circulating counterfeit money, engaging now and then in the side speculation of burglary, as was the case at Tottenville, where he arrived a few hours in advance of the show itself. He and his two companions were deserving of no sympathy, and each was sentenced to ten years in the State prison. The youth of Bud Heyland, his honest repentance and the grief of his father and mother aroused great sympathy for him. It could not be denied that he was[Pg 249] a bad boy, who had started wrong, and was traveling fast along the downward path. In truth, he had already gone so far that it may be said the goal was in sight when he was brought up with such a round turn. A fact greatly in his favor was apparent to all—he had been used as a cat\u0027s paw by others. He was ignorant of counterfeit money, though easily persuaded to engage in the scheme of passing it upon others. True, the proposition to rob the Perkinpine sisters came from him, but in that sad affair also he was put forward as the chief agent, while his partner took good care to keep in the background. Bud saw the fearful precipice on whose margin he stood. His parents were almost heart-broken, and there could be no doubt of his anxiety to atone, so far as possible, for the evil he had done. Fortunately, the judge was not only just but merciful, and, anxious to save the youth, he discharged him under a \"suspended sentence,\" as it was called, a most unusual proceeding under the circumstances, but which proved most beneficent, since the lad never gave any evidence of a desire to return to his evil ways. As for Master Fred Sheldon, I almost feel as though it is unnecessary to tell you anything more about him, for, with such a mother, with such natural inclinations, and with such training, happiness, success and prosperity are as sure to follow as the morning is to succeed the darkness of night. I tell you, boys, you may feel inclined to slight the old saying that honesty is the best policy, but no truer[Pg 250] words were ever written, and you should carry them graven on your hearts to the last hours of your life. Fred grew into a strong, sturdy boy, who held the respect and esteem of the neighborhood. The sisters Perkinpine, as well as many others, took a deep interest in him and gave him help in many ways, and often when the boy was embarrassed by receiving it. The time at last came, when our \"Young Hero\" bade good-by to his loved mother, and went to the great city of New York to carve his fortune. There he was exposed to manifold more temptations than ever could be the case in his simple country home, but he was encased in the impenetrable armor of truthfulness, honesty, industry and right principles, and from this armor all the darts of the great adversary \"rolled off like rustling rain.\" Fred is now a man engaged in a prosperous business in the metropolis of our country, married to a loving and helpful wife, who seems to hold the sweetest and tenderest place in his affection, surpassed by that of no one else, but equalled by her who has been his guardian angel from infancy—HIS MOTHER. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3290/89960.html","bookId":461,"book":{"id":461,"title":"A Young Hero","description":"简介： A fight!
