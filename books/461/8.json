{"id":32665,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. A DAY OF EXCITEMENT IN TOTTENVILLE.","content":"If any of our readers were ever so unfortunate as to be in the neighborhood of a menagerie of animals when one of the fiercest has broken loose he can form some idea of the confusion, terror and consternation caused by the escape of the lion from his cage. Strong men rushed headlong over each other; parents caught up their children and struggled desperately to get as far as possible from the dreadful beast; the other animals uttered fierce growls and cries; women and children screamed and fainted; brave escorts deserted young ladies, leaving them to look out for themselves, while they joined in the frantic struggle for life; some crawled under the wagons; others clambered upon the top, and one man, original even in his panic, scrambled into the cage just vacated by the lion, intending to do his utmost to keep the rightful owner from getting back again. Could any one have looked upon the exciting scene, and preserved his self-possession, he would have observed a burly boy climbing desperately up the center pole, never pausing until he reached the point where the heavy ropes of the canvas converged, when he stopped panting, and looked down on what was passing beneath him. [Pg 74] The name of that young man was Bud Heyland. Among the multitude that swarmed through the entrance to the tent, which was choked until strong men fought savagely to beat back the mad tide, were three boys who got outside safely on their feet, and, drawing in their breath, broke into a blind but very earnest run that was intended to take them as far as possible from the dangerous spot. They were Jimmy Emery, Joe Hunt and Fred Sheldon. The last-named saw the lion make a tremendous bound, which landed him almost at his feet, and Fred was sure it was all over with him; but he did not stand still and be devoured, but plunged in among the struggling mass and reached the exterior of the tent without a scratch. High above the din and tumult rose the shout of the principal showman: \"Don\u0027t kill the lion! Don\u0027t kill the lion!\" It was hard to see the necessity for this cry, inasmuch as the danger seemed to be altogether the other way, but the one who uttered the useless words was evidently afraid some of the people would begin shooting at the beast, which was altogether too valuable to lose, if there was any way of avoiding it. It may be, too, that he believed a general fusillade, when the confusion was so great, would be more perilous to the people than to the lion. There is reason in the belief that, as some scientists claim, there is a sense of humor which sometimes comes[Pg 75] to the surface in certain animals, and the action of the Numidian lion when he broke out tended to confirm such a statement. He seemed to forget all about the sharp cut he had received across the nose and eyes the moment he was clear of his cage and to enjoy the hubbub he created. Had he chosen he could have lacerated and killed a score of children within his reach, but instead of doing so he jumped at the terrified crowd, striking them pretty hard blows with his fore paws, then wheeling about and making for another group, who were literally driven out of their senses by the sight of the brute coming toward them. One young gentleman who was with a lady left her without a word, and, catching sight of a small ladder, placed it hastily against the center pole and ran rapidly up the rounds, but the ladder itself stood so nearly perpendicular that when he reached the top and looked around to see whether the king of beasts was following him, it tipped backward, and he fell directly upon the shoulders of the lion, rolling off and turning a back somersault, where he lay kicking with might and main, and shouting to everybody to come and take him away. The brute paid no attention to him except to act in a confused manner for a minute or two, when he darted straight across the ring to an open space in the wall of the tent, made by some men who had cut it with their knives. The next moment he was on the outside. The bewilderment and consternation seemed to increase every minute, and did not abate when the lion[Pg 76] was seen to be galloping up the road toward a forest, in which he disappeared. A number of the show people ran after him, shouting and calling continually to others to keep out of his way and not to kill him. The beast had entered a track of dense woodland, covering fully a dozen acres, and abounding with undergrowth, where it was probable he could hide himself for days from his would-be captors. The incident broke up the exhibition for the afternoon, although it was announced that it would go on again as usual in the evening, when something like self-possession came back to the vast swarm of people scattered through the village and over the grounds, it was found that although a number had been severely bruised and trampled upon, no one was seriously injured, and what was the strangest fact of all, no one could be found who had suffered any hurt from the lion. This was unaccountable to nearly every one, though the explanation, or partial one, at least, appeared within the succeeding few days. Had the lion been able to understand the peril into which he entered by this freak of his it may be safely said that he would not have left his cage, for no sooner had the community a chance to draw breath and realize the situation than they resolved that it would never do to allow such a ferocious animal to remain at large. \"Why, he can hide in the woods there and sally out and kill a half dozen at a time, just as they do in their native country,\" said Archie Jackson, discussing the matter in the village store. [Pg 77] \"Yes,\" assented a neighbor; \"the lion is the awfulest kind of a creature, which is why they call him the king of beasts. In Brazil and Italy, where they run wild, they\u0027re worse than—than—than a—that is—than a steam b\u0027iler explosion.\" \"We must organize,\" added the constable, compressing his thin lips; \"self-protection demands it.\" \"I think we had better call on the Governor to bring out the military, and to keep up the hunt until he is exterminated.\" \"No need of calling on the military, so long as the civil law is sufficient,\" insisted Archie. \"A half-dozen of us, well armed, will be able to smoke him out.\" \"Will you j\u0027ine?\" asked one of the neighbors. The constable cleared his throat before saying: \"I\u0027ve some important business on my hands that\u0027ll keep me pretty busy for a few days. If you will wait till that is over, it will give me pleasure—ahem!—to j\u0027ine you.\" \"By that time there won\u0027t be any of us left to j\u0027ine,\" said the neighbor with a contemptuous sniff. \"It looks very much, Archie, as though you were trying to get out of it.\" The constable grew red in the face at the general smile this caused, and said, in his most impressive manner: \"Gentlemen, I\u0027ll go with you in search of the lion; more than that, gentlemen and fellow-citizens, I\u0027ll lead you.\" \"That\u0027s business; you ain\u0027t such a big coward as people say you are.\" [Pg 78] \"Who says I\u0027m a coward—show him to me——\" At this moment one of the young men attached to the menagerie and circus entered, and when all became still said: \"Gentlemen, my name is Jacob Kincade, and I\u0027m the keeper of the lion which broke out to-day and is off somewhere in the woods. He is a very valuable animal to us, we having imported him directly from the Bushman country, at a great expense. His being at large has created a great excitement, as was to be expected, but we don\u0027t want him killed.\" \"Of course not,\" said Archie Jackson, who echoed the sentiment of his neighbors, as he added, \"You prefer that he should go raging \u0027round the country and chaw us all up instead. My friend, that little scheme won\u0027t work; we\u0027re just on the point of organizing an exploring expedition to shoot the lion. Our duty to our wives and families demands that we should extirpate the scourge. Yes, sir,\" added Archie, rising from his chair and gesticulating like an orator, \"as patriots we are bound to prevent any foreign monsters, especially them as are worshiped by the red-coats, to squat on our soil and murder our citizens. The glorious American eagle——\" \"One minute,\" interrupted Mr. Kincade, with a wave of his hand. \"It isn\u0027t the eagle, but the lion we are considering. The menagerie, having made engagements so far ahead, must show in Lumberton to-morrow evening, but two of us will stay behind to arrange for his recapture. Bud Heyland, whose home is in this vicinity,[Pg 79] and myself would like to employ a dozen of you to assist. You will be well paid therefor, and whoever secures him, without harm, will receive a reward of a hundred dollars.\" While these important words were being uttered, Archie Jackson remained standing on the floor, facing the speaker, with his hand still raised, as if he intended resuming his patriotic speech at the point where it had been broken in upon. But when the showman stopped Archie stood staring at him with mouth open, hand raised and silent tongue. \"Go on,\" suggested one at his elbow. But the constable let his arm fall against his side, and said: \"I had a good thing about the emblem of British tyranny, but he put me out. Will give a hundred dollars, eh? That\u0027s another matter altogether. But I say, Mr. Kincade, how shall we go to work to capture a lion? That sort of game ain\u0027t abundant in these parts, and I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any one here that\u0027s ever hunted \u0027em.\" Old Mr. Scrapton, who was known to be the teller of the most amazing stories ever heard in the neighborhood, opened his mouth to relate how he had lassoed lions forty years before, when he was hunting on the plains of Texas, but he restrained himself. He thought it best to wait till this particular beast had been disposed of and was out of the neighborhood. \"I may say, gentlemen,\" added the showman, with a peculiar smile, \"that this lion is not so savage and [Pg 80]dangerous as most people think. You will call to mind, although he broke loose in the afternoon, when the tent was crowded with people, and when he had every opportunity he could wish, yet he did not hurt any one.\" \"That is a very remarkable circumstance,\" said the constable, in a low voice, heard by all. \"I am warranted, therefore,\" added Mr. Kincade, \"in saying that there is no cause for such extreme fright on your part. You should fix some sort of cage and bait it with meat. Then watch, and when he goes in spring the trap, and there he is.\" \"Yes, but will he stay there?\" \"If the trap is strong enough.\" \"How would it do to lasso him?\" \"If you are skilled in throwing the lasso and can fling several nooses over his head simultaneously from different directions. By that I mean if three or four of you can lasso him at the same instant, from different directions, so he will be held fast, why the scheme will work splendidly.\" All eyes turned toward old Mr. Scrapton, who cleared his throat, threw one leg over the other and looked very wise. It was known that he had a long buffalo thong looped and hanging over his fire-place at home, with which, he had often told, he used to lasso wild horses in the Southwest. When the old gentleman saw the general interest he had awakened, he nodded his head patronizingly and said: [Pg 81] \"Yes, boys, I\u0027ll go with you and show you how the thing is done.\" The important conversation, of which we have given a part, took place in the principal store in Tottenville late on the evening succeeding the escape of the lion and after the performance was over. Mr. Kincade, by virtue of his superior experience with wild animals, gave the men a great many good points and awakened such an ambition in them to capture the beast that he was quite hopeful of his being retaken in a short time. It was understood that if the lion was injured in any way not a penny\u0027s reward would be paid, and a careful observer of matters would have thought there was reason to fear the neighbors were placing themselves in great personal peril, through their anxiety to take the king of beasts alive and unharmed. On the morrow, when the children wended their way to the old stone school-house again, they stopped to look at Archie Jackson, who was busy tearing down the huge posters of the menagerie and circus, preparatory to tacking up some others which he had brought with him and held under his arm. The constable dipped into several professions. He sometimes dug wells and helped to move houses for his neighbors. Beside this, he was known as the auctioneer of the neighborhood, and tacked up the announcement posters for himself. As soon as he had cleared a space, he posted the following, printed in large, black letters: [Pg 82] ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD. The above reward will be paid for the capture of the lion which escaped from Bandman\u0027s great menagerie and circus on Tuesday the twenty-first instant. Nothing will be paid if the animal is injured in any manner. The undersigned will be at the Tottenville Hotel for a few days, and will hand the reward named to any one who will secure the lion so that he can be returned to his cage. Jacob Kincade. Directly beneath this paper was placed a second one, and it seemed a curious coincident that it also was the announcement of a reward. FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD. The above reward will be paid for the recovery of the silver tea-service stolen from the residence of the Misses Perkinpine on the night of the twentieth instant. A liberal price will be given for anything in the way of information which may lead to the recovery of the property or the detection of the thieves. Attached to the last was a minute description of the various articles stolen, and the information that any one who wished further particulars could receive them by communicating with Archibald Jackson, constable, in Tottenville. The menagerie and circus had departed, but the excitement which it left behind was probably greater and more intense than that which preceded its arrival. Its coming was announced by a daring robbery, and when it went the most terrible animal in its \"colossal and unparalleled collection\" remained to prowl through the woods and feast upon the men, women, boys and[Pg 83] girls of the neighborhood, to say nothing of the cows, oxen, sheep, lambs and pigs with which it was to be supposed the king of beasts would amuse himself when he desired a little recreation that should remind him of his native, far-away country. Around these posters were gathered the same trio which we pictured on the opening of our story. \"I tell you I\u0027d like to catch that lion,\" said Jimmy Emery, smacking his lips over the prospect; \"but I don\u0027t see how it can be done.\" \"Why couldn\u0027t we coax him into the school-house this afternoon after all the girls and boys are gone?\" asked Joe Hunt; \"it\u0027s so low and flat he would take it for his den, that is, if we kill a calf and lay it inside the door.\" \"But Mr. McCurtis stays an hour after school to set copies,\" said Fred Sheldon. Joe Hunt scratched his arms, which still felt the sting of the blows for his failure in his lessons, and said: \"That\u0027s one reason why I am so anxious to get the lion in there.\" \"Well, younkers, I s\u0027pose you\u0027re going to earn both of them rewards?\" It was Bud Heyland who uttered these words, as he halted among the boys, who were rather shy of him. Bud had his trousers tucked in the top of his boots, his sombrero and blue shirt on, his rank brier-wood pipe in his mouth, and the whip, whose lash looked like a long, coiling black snake, in his hand. His face was red as usual, with blotches on his nose[Pg 84] and cheeks, such as must have been caused by dissipation. He was ugly by nature, and had the neighborhood been given the choice between having him and the lion as a pest it may be safely said that Bud would not have been the choice of all. \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027s much chance for us,\" said Fred Sheldon, quietly edging away from the bully; \"for I don\u0027t see how we are to catch and hold him.\" \"It would not do for him to see you,\" said Bud, taking his pipe from his mouth and grinning at Fred. \"Why not?\" \"He\u0027s so fond of calves he\u0027d be sure to go for you.\" \"That\u0027s why he tried so hard to get at you, I s\u0027pose, when you climbed the tent pole and was so scared you\u0027ve been pale ever since.\" Bud was angered by this remark, which caused a general laugh, and he raised his whip, but just then he saw the teacher, Mr. McCurtis, close at hand, and he refrained. Although large and strong, like all bullies, he was a coward, and could not forget the severe drubbing received from this severe pedagogue, \"all of ye olden times.\" He walked sullenly away, resolved to punish the impudent Fred Sheldon before he left the neighborhood, while the ringing of the cracked bell a minute or two later drew the boys and girls to the building and the studies of the day were begun. Young Fred Sheldon was the brightest and best boy in school, and he got through his lessons with his usual facility, but it may be said that his thoughts were anywhere but in the school-room. [Pg 85] Indeed, there was plenty to rack his brain over, for during the few minutes when Bud Heyland stood talking to the boys before school Fred was impressed more than ever with the fact that his voice resembled that of the tramp who had been entertained by the Misses Perkinpine a couple of nights before. \"I s\u0027pose he tried to make his voice sound different,\" thought Fred, \"but he didn\u0027t remember it all the time. Bud\u0027s voice is coarser than it used to be, which I s\u0027pose is because it\u0027s changing, but every once in awhile it sounded just like it did a few minutes ago. \"Then it seems to me,\" added our hero, pursuing the same train of perplexing thought, \"that the voice of the other man—the one that come on to me in the lane—was like somebody I\u0027ve heard, but I can\u0027t think who the person can be.\" Fred took out his new knife and looked at it in a furtive way. When he had admired it a few minutes he fixed his eyes on the three letters cut in the brass piece. \"They\u0027re \u0027N. H. H.,\u0027\" he said, \"as sure as I live; but \u0027N. H. H.\u0027 don\u0027t stand for Bud Heyland, though the last name is the same. If that was Bud who stole the silver then he must have dropped the knife on the floor, though I don\u0027t see how he could do it without knowing it. I s\u0027pose he stole the knife from some one else.\" The boy had not shown his prize to any of his playmates, having thought it best to keep it out of sight. He could not help believing that Bud Heyland had something to do with the robbery, but it was difficult to[Pg 86] think of any way by which the offense could be proven against him. \"He\u0027ll deny it, of course, and even Aunt Annie and Lizzie will declare that it wasn\u0027t him that sat at the table the other night and eat enough for a half-dozen men, or as much as I wanted, anyway. He\u0027s such a mean, ugly boy that I wish I could prove it on him—that is, if he did it.\" That day Fred received word from his mother that she would not return for several days, and he was directed to look after the house, while he was permitted to sleep at the old brick mansion if he chose. Accordingly Fred saw that all his chores were properly done after he reached home that afternoon, when he started for the home of the maiden ladies, where he was more than welcome. The boy followed the same course he took two nights before, and his thoughts were so occupied that he went along at times almost instinctively, as may be said. \"Gracious,\" he muttered, \"but if I could find that silver for them—she don\u0027t say anything about the money that was taken—that would be an awful big reward. Five hundred dollars! It would more than pay the mortgage on our place. Then that one hundred dollars for the lion—gracious alive!\" gasped Fred, stopping short and looking around in dismay. \"I wonder where that lion is. He\u0027s been loose twenty-four hours, and I should like to know how many people he has killed. I heard he was seen up among the hills this morning, and eat a whole family and a team of horses, but I think maybe there\u0027s some mistake about it. [Pg 87] \"I wonder why he didn\u0027t kill somebody yesterday when he had such a good chance. He jumped right down in front of me, and I just gave up, and wished I was a better boy before I should go and leave mother alone; but he didn\u0027t pay any attention to me, nor anybody else, but he\u0027s a terrible creature, for all that.\" Now that Fred\u0027s thoughts were turned toward the beast that was prowling somewhere in the neighborhood, he could think of nothing else. There was the fact that this peril was a present one, which drove all thoughts of Bud Heyland and the robbery from the mind of the boy. The rustling wind, the murmur of the woods, and the soft, hollow roar of the distant river were all suggestive of the dreaded lion, and Fred found himself walking on tip-toe and peering forward in the gloom, often stopping and looking behind and around, and fancying he caught an outline of the crouching beast. But at last he reached the short lane and began moving with a rapid and confident step. The moon was shining a little more brightly than when he went over the ground before, and here and there the rays found their way between the poplars and served to light the road in front. \"I guess he is asleep in the woods and will keep out of sight till he\u0027s found——\" The heart of Fred Sheldon rose in his throat, and, as he stopped short, it seemed that his hair rose on end. And well it might, for there, directly in the road before him, where the moon\u0027s rays shot through the branches, the unmistakable figure of the dreaded lion suddenly appeared. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3290/89945.html","bookId":461,"book":{"id":461,"title":"A Young Hero","description":"简介： A fight!
