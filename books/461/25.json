{"id":32682,"no":25,"title":"HOW THE HATCHET WAS BURIED. BY OCTAVIA CARROLL.","content":"A feud, as fierce as that between the Montagues and Capulets, had for several years raged between the boys of Valleytown and the country lads living on the breezy hills just above the small village. Originating in a feeling of jealousy, it waxed hotter and more bitter with every game of ball and every examination at the \"Academy\" where they were forced to meet the rival factions, tauntingly dubbing each other \"Lilies of the Valley\" and \"Ground Moles,\" while if a Lily chanced to whip a Mole in a fair fight all the town-bred youths immediately stood on their heads for joy, and if a Mole went above a Lily in class, the entire hill company crowed as loudly as the chanticleers of the barnyard. By general consent two boys had come to be considered the leaders of the respective factions; handsome, quick-witted Roy Hastings of the former, and stronger, bright Carl Duckworth of the latter; while it[Pg 261] was an annoyance to each that their sisters had struck up a \"bosom friendship\" and stubbornly refused to share in their brothers\u0027 feud. \"It is so absurd in Roy,\" said Helen Hastings, \"to want me not to visit Maizie, whom I love so dearly, just because one of her family has beaten him at baseball and shot more pigeons this spring.\" \"And Helen shall come to tea as often as she likes to put up with our plain fare,\" declared little Miss Duckworth, \"even if Carl does look like a thunder-cloud all supper time and has hardly enough politeness to pass the butter.\" So matters stood when, one evening in early June, the commander of the heights\u0027 coterie summoned his followers to a meeting in the loft of an old barn on his father\u0027s estate, that was only used as a storehouse since a better one had been built. \"Hello, fellows, what is this pow-wow about?\" asked agile Mark Tripp, as he sprang up a rickety ladder and popped his head through the square opening in the attic floor. \"Dun\u0027no; some bee, Duckworth, here, has buzzing round in his bonnet,\" replied lazy Hugh Blossom from the hay, where he reclined. \"It takes the captain to have \u0027happy thoughts,\u0027\" while, playfully pulling a refractory lock of hair sticking out from Carl\u0027s head, he gaily chanted: [Pg 262] \"And the duck with the feather curled over his back, He leads all the others, with his quack! quack! quack!\" \"Good enough! All right, Ducky, proceed with your quacking! Let\u0027s know what\u0027s up! Are the \u0027low-ly lil-is of the val-ly\u0027 once more on the war path? And to what do they challenge us—a spelling match or a swimming race?\" \"To neither. Those very superior posies are about to seek glory in another way. I have learned from a most reliable source that they are now hoarding all their pocket money in order to astonish the natives. In fact, fellers, they intend to fresco Valleytown a decided carmine on the \u0027Glorious Fourth,\u0027 and we have got to make the hills hum to quench \u0027em.\" \"What form is their celebration to take?\" asked little Peter Wheatly. \"Fireworks, principally. Real stunners! Not just a few Roman candles and sky-rockets, but flower-pots throwing up colored balls that burst into stars, zigzagging serpents, and all sorts of things, such as have never been seen round here before. Why, our big bonfire and giant crackers will be nowhere.\" \"Right you are there, Cap,\" said Hugh. \"They will have all the country down on the Green patting them on the back for their public spirit, while we occupy a back seat. It\u0027s a pretty bright move for the Lilies, and I don\u0027t see how we can prevent it.\" [Pg 263] \"Get up a counter-attraction. Pyro—pyro—what do you call \u0027em will make a good deal finer show from Round Knob than down yonder in the dale.\" \"Sure. But where are your pyrotechnics to come from?\" \"From the city, of course. See here, I wrote to a firm there as soon as I learned the Lilies\u0027 secret, and they sent me a price-list.\" Young Duckworth produced a very gay red and yellow circular, but the boys only looked at each other in blank amazement. The hillside farmers were nearly all land poor, gaining but a bare subsistence out of the rocky New England soil and seldom had a dime, much less dollars, to squander on mere amusement. \"Guess you think we are Rothschilds or Vanderbilts,\" snickered small Peter. \"Pennies always burn a hole in my pocket and drop right out,\" said Mark. \"I might chip in a copper cent and a nickel with a dig in it,\" drawled Hugh, and there was no one else who could do better. \"Well, I know you are an impecunious lot,\" continued Carl, \"but next week the strawberries will be dead ripe. If you fellows will only be patriotic and pitch in and pick for the cause we can put Roy Hastings and his top-lofty crowd to the blush by getting up a really respectable show with a \u0027piece\u0027 as a topper off. I don\u0027t believe the Valleyites ever thought of a \u0027piece.\u0027\" [Pg 264] \"What sort of a piece?\" asked Bud Perkins. \"Why, a fancy piece of fireworks, of course. Just listen to what Powder \u0026 Co. offer!\" and Carl read aloud: \"\u0027Realistic spectacle of Mother Goose, in peaked hat and scarlet cloak, with her gander by her side. The head of George Washington, the Father of his Country, surrounded by thirteen stars. Very fine. Superb figure of Christopher Columbus landing from his Spanish galleon upon the American shore. One of our most magnificent designs.\" \"There, don\u0027t that sound prime? They\u0027re expensive, awfully expensive, but we can economize on the rockets and little things to come out strong, in a blaze of glory, at the end. I warrant a Mother Goose or, better yet, a Washington would shut up the Lilies\u0027 leaves in a jiffy.\" \"Or Christopher Columbus—I vote for old Chris,\" shouted Mark. \"Yes, yes, Chris and his galleon,\" chorused the others. \"It is the dearest of them all,\" remarked Carl, somewhat dubiously. \"No matter, \u0027Chris or nothing,\u0027 say we.\" So it was decided, and before the boys parted they had all agreed, if they could win their parents\u0027 consent, to hire out for the berry-picking and to contribute every cent thus earned toward the Fourth of July celebration. There is no spur like competition, and for the next three weeks the ambitious youths devoted themselves[Pg 265] heart, and soul, and fingers to the cause; but the pickers had their reward, when, the berry harvest over, they found they could send a tolerably satisfactory order to Powder \u0026 Co., and when, on the third of July, a great box arrived by express, was unpacked, and its contents secretly, and under the cover of night, stored away in the lower part of Farmer Duckworth\u0027s discarded barn, their exuberant delight burst forth in sundry ecstatic somersaults and Indian-like dances. It may be, however, that their exultation might have been tempered with caution had they been aware of two figures gliding stealthily through the darkness without, and known that the case, bearing the name of the city firm, when it was taken from the train, had not escaped the sharp eyes of Roy Hastings and his chum Ed Spafford. \"How do you suppose they ever raised the money to buy all those fireworks?\" asked one shadow of another shadow, as they flitted down the hill. \"I don\u0027t know, confound \u0027em! But I do know their show is better than ours, and something has got to be done!\" \"Yes, indeed, and surely, Roy, there must be some way!\" \"There always is where there is a will, and—and—matches!\" Boom, boom, boom! Old Captain Stone\u0027s ancient[Pg 266] cannon announced the advent of another Independence Day shortly after midnight, and Young America was quickly abroad with the Chinese cracker and torpedo. Helen Hastings disliked the deafening racket of the village and, therefore, early beat a retreat to the hills, determined to enjoy the day in her own fashion with Maizie, who welcomed her with open arms. \"I am so glad you have come, Nell, dear, for I was feeling as blue as your sash, if it is the Fourth of July!\" \"Why, darling, what is the matter?\" \"Oh, I am so worried because pa is worried. He don\u0027t act a bit like his dear, jolly, old self, but goes round with a long face and can neither eat nor sleep. Ma says it is because a mortgage or something is coming due, and the crops have been so bad for several years that he is afraid he may have to sell the farm and move out West. It would just break my heart to leave this place.\" \"So it would mine. But there, Maizie, it is foolish to be troubled about what may never happen. It is so warm let us find a nice cool spot and finish the book we commenced the other day.\" \"There is a good current of air through the loft of the old barn. We will go there if you can scramble up the ladder.\" This, with some assistance, Helen succeeded in doing,[Pg 267] and the two girls were soon nestling in the sweet, new-mown hay. \"Eleven o\u0027clock,\" announced Helen, consulting her little chatelaine watch as they finally laid down the entertaining story they had been reading, \"and I am both sleepy and thirsty.\" \"Well, my dear, lie back and take a nap and I will go and make lemonade for us both.\" \"Really? Oh, that will be delicious!\" and throwing herself back on the fragrant mow she closed her eyes as her blithe, hospitable friend skipped off toward the house. The twittering of the swallows in the eaves and the hum of the insects in the meadows without were curiously soothing, and the fair maid fell into a light doze from which, however, she was rudely awakened by a terrific explosion. She sprang to her feet in alarm to find the floor heaving like the deck of a ship at sea and feel the tumble-down building rocking as though shaken to its very foundation. \"What has happened! Is it an earthquake?\" she gasped, rushing to the ladder-way; but she started back in affright at sight of a mass of flame and flying, fiery objects below. \"Oh, this is terrible!\" Was she, Helen Hastings—her father\u0027s pride, her brothers\u0027 pet—to meet a violent death here in this lonely spot? Expecting every instant to have the boards give way beneath her, she flew[Pg 268] to the window and, in her desperation, would have leaped out, regardless of a huge pile of stones beneath, had not the voice of Maizie at that moment reached her ear calling: \"Don\u0027t jump, Helen; don\u0027t jump! You will be killed! Wait! courage! I am going for help.\" Even as she faltered hesitatingly, her strength failed, her senses reeled and she fell fainting to the ground. Across lots from Round Knob, where they had been preparing for the evening exhibition, came Carl Duckworth, Hugh Blossom and Bud Perkins. They were in high spirits, discussing with animation the anticipated fun, when Bud suddenly stopped short, asking, \"Who are those fellows making tracks so fast down the road?\" \"Looks like Roy Hastings and Ed Spafford,\" replied Hugh. \"Though what brings them this way on such a day as this puzzles me.\" \"I hope they haven\u0027t got wind of our plans and been up to some mischief,\" said Carl, uneasily, instinctively quickening his footsteps. A moment later, as they entered the farm gate, the explosion that had awakened Helen made them also start and gaze at each other in dismay. Then a howl of mingled rage, grief and astonishment burst from the trio as through the open door of the old barn shot a confused medley of rockets, pin-wheels, snakes and grasshoppers, popping and fizzing madly in the garish sunlight; a howl that culminated in a shriek when whirling and[Pg 269] spinning out whizzed the famous \"piece,\" the Landing of Columbus, thrown by the concussion far upon the grass, where it went off in a highly erratic manner, poor Christopher appearing perfectly demoralized as he stood on his head in the brilliant galleon, with his feet waving amid a galaxy of stars. \"All our three weeks\u0027 labor and all our money gone up in smoke!\" groaned Bud, flinging himself down in an agony of despair. \"And it is Roy Hastings\u0027 mean, dastardly work,\" growled Hugh; while Carl turned pale with wrath and shook his fist in a way that boded no good to his enemy. Indeed, at that instant, he felt that revenge, swift and telling, would be the sweetest thing in life. Truly, then, it seemed the very irony of fate, when, from amid the wreaths of smoke pouring from the upper loft window, emerged for a brief second a girlish, white-robed figure, with beseeching, outstretched hands, that paused, swayed, then fell back and disappeared, while Maizie rushed toward them crying, \"Oh, Carl, Carl! The old barn is on fire, and Helen is in there!\" \"What! Roy Hastings\u0027 sister?\" and Hugh actually laughed aloud. \"Serves the mean rascal right, too, if she was killed, for he would have no one but himself to blame,\" said Bud Perkins, whose bark was always worse than his bite,[Pg 270] and who was really as kind-hearted a chap as ever lived. \"Oh, you bad, cruel boys!\" exclaimed Maizie; \"but Carl, I know, will not be so wicked,\" and she turned imploringly to her brother, in whose mind a fierce struggle was going on. In a flash, he saw his foe bowed and crushed with remorse, a \"paying back\" far beyond anything he could have dreamed of! Besides, the risk was tremendous, and why should he endanger his life? But the next moment humanity triumphed, and shouting, \"We can\u0027t stand idle and see a girl perish before our eyes! So here goes,\" he sped off toward the burning building, stripping off his jacket, as he ran, which he plunged into a barrel of water and then wrapped closely about his head. Thus protected, he bravely dashed through the flames lapping at him with their fiery tongues. His breath came in short, quick pants, he was nearly suffocated, and falling rafters warned him that he had no time to spare. Valiantly, however, he struggled to the already charred ladder and groped his way up it, until, gasping and exhausted, he reached the window with the unconscious girl in his arms, as the fire was eating through the floor at his feet. To the anxious watchers outside, it appeared an eternity before the lad reached the window and deftly caught the rope they had ready to toss to him. With trembling fingers he knotted this about Helen\u0027s waist,[Pg 271] gently let her down into the arms of Bud and Hugh and then prepared to descend himself, when a groan of horror from the onlookers rent the air; there was a quiver, a sudden giving way, a deafening crash and roar. The flooring had at length succumbed to the destroying element and gone down. Mrs. Duckworth sank on her knees sobbing. \"Oh, my boy! my boy!\" and Maizie hid her face. But, as the smoke cleared away, the groan changed to a joyous shout and all looked up to behold the youth clinging to the casement, which was still upheld by two feeble supports. Hugh sprang forward. \"Carl, drop! Let yourself drop,\" he called. \"We will catch you,\" and Carl, as a great darkness overwhelmed him, dropped like a dead weight and was borne, a begrimed and senseless burden, to his own little room in the cozy old homestead. Summer was over ere a mere wraith of sturdy, lively Carl Duckworth was able to creep down stairs to sit on the veranda and gaze listlessly out upon the mountain landscape in its early autumn dress. But, after weary weeks of pain and anxiety, he was on the mend, and there was something of the old merriment in his laugh when he caught sight of a row of urchins, perched on the fence like a motley flock of birds, singing with hearty good will, \"See, the Conquering Hero Comes!\" and he was surprised to recognize in the welcoming choristers many \"Lilies\" of Valleytown, as well as his own familiar friends. [Pg 272] It was something of an astonishment, too, to have Roy Hastings hurry forward to offer his hand and say: \"I can\u0027t tell you, Duckworth, how glad I am to see you out again and only wish you would give me a good sound kicking;\" while surely there were tears in his eyes and a curious break in his voice. It was a boy\u0027s way of begging pardon, but, being a boy, Carl understood, while as he looked into the other\u0027s white worn face, so changed since he saw it last, he dimly comprehended that there might be \"coals of fire\" which burn more sharply even than the blisters and stings that had caused him such days and nights of agony. So the grasp he gave Roy was warm and cordial as he said, \"Well, I\u0027m not equal to much kicking yet, old fellow; but, for one, I am tired of this old feud and think it is time we buried the hatchet.\" \"Oh, I am so glad!\" cried a merry voice in the doorway, and out danced Helen with her hands full of flowers. \"You dear, heroic Carl. I have come to thank you, too, though I never, never can, for rescuing me on that dreadful day, and, as some small return, they have let me be the first to tell you of the silver lining hidden behind that cloud of smoke.\" \"What do you mean?\" asked Carl, thoroughly mystified. \"I mean that Christopher Columbus and his [Pg 273]combustible companions did a pretty good turn after all. They plowed up the ground under the old barn so well that when the rubbish was cleared away there came to light what promises to be the finest paint mine in the whole country.\" \"Paint mine!\" \"Yes, sir. Non-inflammable, mineral paint that will not only save the farm, but, perhaps, make all our fortunes.\" \"It\u0027s true, Carl, every word true,\" laughed Maizie, who had stolen softly up. \"Papa has had the ore analyzed, and is so happy he beams like a full moon. Judge Hastings, too, has been so kind, advancing funds, getting up a company and preparing to build a kiln. It has been quite the excitement of the summer in Valleytown.\" \"Well, well! This is glorious news! Hip, hip, hooray!\" a feeble cheer that was echoed and re-echoed by the faction on the fence. \"Dear me, haven\u0027t you finished your revelations yet?\" exclaimed Mark Tripp, suddenly tumbling up the steps. \"For if you have the \u0027Lilies of the Valley\u0027 request the captain of the \u0027Ground Moles\u0027 and the young ladies to occupy the piazza chairs and witness a pyrotechnical display postponed from the Fourth of July, but now given in honor of the recovery of our esteemed citizen, Carl Duckworth, and of our Peace Jubilee.\" [Pg 274] All laughed at Mark\u0027s pompous little speech and hastened to take their places. So at last in a shower of golden sparks they buried the hatchet and the feud between Valleytown and Hillside ended forever amid a generous display of fire-works. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3290/89962.html","bookId":461,"book":{"id":461,"title":"A Young Hero","description":"简介： A fight!
