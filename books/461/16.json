{"id":32673,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER XVI. BUD\u0027S MISHAPS.","content":"When a horse takes it into his head to go home, with a view of having a good meal, the attraction seems to become stronger from the moment he makes the first move. Bud Heyland\u0027s animal began with a very moderate pace, but he increased it so rapidly that by the time the angry driver was on the run, the quadruped was going almost equally as fast. In the hope of scaring the brute into stopping Bud shouted: \"Whoa! whoa! Stop, or I\u0027ll kill you!\" If the horse understood the command, he did not appreciate the threat, and, therefore, it served rather as a spur to his exertion, for he went faster than ever. It is well known, also, that under such circumstances the sagacious animal is only intent on reaching home with the least delay, and he does not care a pin whether his flight injures the vehicle behind him or not. In fact, he seems to be better pleased if it does suffer some disarrangement. When, therefore, the animal debouched from the wood into the faint light under the stars he was on a gallop, and the wagon was bounding along from side to[Pg 176] side in an alarming way. Bud was not far behind it, and shouting in his fiercest manner, he soon saw that he was only wasting his strength. He then ceased his outcries and devoted all his energies to overtaking the runaway horse. \"It\u0027ll be just like him to smash the wagon all to flinders,\" growled Bud, \"and I\u0027ll have to pay for the damages.\" As nearly as could be determined, horse and lad were going at the same pace, the boy slightly gaining, perhaps, and growing more furious each minute, for this piece of treachery on the part of the horse. Some twenty yards separated the pursuer from the team, when a heavy, lumbering wagon loomed to view ahead. \"Get out of the road!\" called Bud, excitedly. \"This hoss is running away, and he\u0027ll smash you if you don\u0027t!\" At such times a farmer is slow to grasp the situation, and the old gentleman, who was half asleep, could not understand what all the rumpus was about, until the galloping horse was upon him. Then he wrenched his lines, hoping to pull his team aside in time, but his honest nags were as slow as their owner, and all they did was to get themselves out of the way, so as to allow the light vehicle to crash into that to which they were attached. It is the frailer vessel which generally goes to the wall at such times, though Bud\u0027s was armed with a good deal of momentum. As it was the front wheel was twisted off, and the frightened horse continued at a swifter gait[Pg 177] than ever toward his home, while Bud, seeing how useless it was to try to overtake him, turned upon the old farmer, who was carefully climbing out of his wagon to see whether his property had suffered any damage. \"Why didn\u0027t you get out the way when I hollered to you?\" demanded the panting Bud, advancing threateningly upon him. \"Why didn\u0027t you holler sooner, my young friend?\" asked the old gentleman, in a soft voice. \"I yelled to you soon enough, and you\u0027re a big fool that you didn\u0027t pull aside as I told you. I hope your old rattle-trap has been hurt so it can\u0027t be fixed up.\" \"I can\u0027t diskiver that it\u0027s been hurt at all, and I\u0027m very thankful,\" remarked the farmer, stooping down and feeling the spokes and axletree with his hands; \"but don\u0027t you know it is very disrespectful for a boy like you to call an old man a fool?\" Bud snarled: \"I generally say just what I mean, and what are you going to do about it, old Hay Seed?\" The gentleman thus alluded to showed what he meant to do about it, for he reached quietly upward and lifted his whip from its socket in the front of the wagon. \"I say again,\" added Bud, not noticing the movement, and swaggering about, \"that any man who acts like you is a natural born fool, and the best thing you can do is to go home——\" Just then something cracked like a pistol shot and the whip of the old farmer whizzed about the legs of the astounded scapegrace, who, with a howl similar to that[Pg 178] which Fred Sheldon uttered under similar treatment, bounded high in air and started on a run in the direction of his flying vehicle. At the second step the whip descended again, and it was repeated several times before the terrified Bud could get beyond reach of the indignant gentleman, who certainly showed more vigor than any one not knowing him would have looked for. \"Some boys is very disrespectful, and should be teached manners,\" he muttered, turning calmly about and going back to his team, which stood sleepily in the road awaiting him. \"What\u0027s getting into folks?\" growled Bud Heyland, trying to rub his smarting legs in half a dozen places at once; \"that\u0027s the sassiest old curmudgeon I ever seen. If I\u0027d knowed he was so sensitive I wouldn\u0027t have argued the matter so strong. Jingo! But he knows how to swing a whip. When he brought down the lash on to me, I orter just jumped right into him and knocked him down, and I\u0027d done it, too, if I hadn\u0027t been afraid of one thing, which was that he\u0027d knocked me down first. Plague on him! I\u0027ll get even with him yet. I wish——\" Bud stopped short in inexpressible disgust, for just then he recalled that he had his loaded revolver with him, and he ought to have used it to defend himself. The assault of the old gentleman was so sudden that his victim had no time to think of anything but to place himself beyond reach of his strong and active arm. \"I don\u0027t know what makes me so blamed slow in thinking of things,\" added Bud, resuming the rubbing[Pg 179] of his legs and his walk toward Tottenville, \"but I must learn to wake up sooner. I\u0027m sure I got in some good work to-day, and I\u0027ll finish it up in style to-morrow night, or my name ain\u0027t Nathaniel Higgins Heyland, and then I\u0027m going to skip out of this slow place in a hurry and have a good time with the boys. What\u0027s that?\" He discerned the dim outlines of some peculiar looking object in the road, and going to it, suddenly saw what it was. \"Yes, I might have knowed it!\" he muttered, with another forcible expression; \"it\u0027s a wagon wheel; the second one off that good-for-nothing one I hired of Grimsby, and I\u0027ll have a pretty bill to pay when I get there. I \u0027spose I\u0027ll find the rest of the wagon strewed all along the road; yes——\" Bud was not far wrong in his supposition, for a little further on he came upon a third wheel, which was leaning against the fence, as though it were \"tired,\" and near by was the fourth. After that the fragments of the ruined vehicle were met with continually, until the angered young man wondered how it was there could be so much material in such an ordinary structure. \"It\u0027s about time I begun to find something of the horse,\" he added, with a grim sense of the grotesque humor of the idea; \"I wouldn\u0027t care if I came across his head and legs scattered along the road, for I\u0027m mad enough agin him to blow him up, but I won\u0027t get the chance, for old Grimsby won\u0027t let me have him agin when I go out to take a ride to-morrow night.\" [Pg 180] Things could not have been in a worse condition than when Bud, tired and angry, walked up on the porch of the hotel and dropped wearily into one of the chairs that were always there. Old Mr. Grimsby was awaiting him, and said the animal was badly bruised, and as for the wagon, the only portion he could find any trace of was the shafts, which came bounding into the village behind the flying horse. Mr. Grimsby\u0027s principal grief seemed to be that Bud himself had not shared the fate of the wagon, and he did not hesitate to so express himself. \"The damages won\u0027t be a cent less than a hundred dollars,\" added the angry keeper of the livery stable. \"Will you call it square for that?\" asked Bud, looking at the man, who was leaning against the post in front of him. \"Yes, of course I will?\" \"Very well; write out a receipt in full and sign it and I\u0027ll pay it.\" Mr. Grimsby scanned him curiously for a minute, and then said: \"If you\u0027re in earnest come over to my office.\" Bud got up and followed him into his little dingy office, where he kept a record of his humble livery business, and after considerable fumbling with his oil-lamp, found pen and paper and the receipt was written and signed. While he was thus employed Bud Heyland had counted one hundred dollars in ten-dollar bills, which he passed over to Mr. Grimsby, who, as was his custom, counted them over several times. [Pg 181] As he did so he noticed that they were crisp, new bills, and looked as if they were in circulation for the first time. He carefully folded them up and put them away in his wallet with a grim smile, such as is apt to be shown by a man of that character when he thinks he has got the better of a friend in a bargain or trade. And as Bud Heyland walked out he smiled, too, in a very meaning way. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3290/89953.html","bookId":461,"book":{"id":461,"title":"A Young Hero","description":"简介： A fight!
