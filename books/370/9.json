{"id":14703,"no":9,"title":"Chapter 8 Troll","content":"ROOT leaned forward, roaring into the microphone. \u0027Mulch! What\u0027s happening? What\u0027s your status?\u0027\n \n Foaly was tapping a keyboard furiously.\n \n \u0027We\u0027ve lost audio. Motion too.\u0027\n \n \u0027Mulch. Talk to me, dammit.\u0027\n \n \u0027I\u0027m running a scan on his vitals ... Woah!\u0027\n \n \u0027What? What is it?\u0027\n \n \u0027His heart has gone crazy. Beating like a rabbit ...\u0027\n \n \u0027A rabbit?\u0027\n \n \u0027No, wait, it\u0027s ...\u0027\n \n \u0027What?\u0027 breathed the commander, terribly afraid that he already knew.\n \n Foaly leaned back in his chair. \u0027It\u0027s stopped. His heartbeat has stopped.\u0027\n \n \u0027Are you sure?\u0027\n \n \u0027The monitors don\u0027t lie. All vitals can be read through the iris-cam. Not a peep. He\u0027s gone.\u0027\n \n Root couldn\u0027t believe it. Mulch Diggums, one of life\u0027s constants. Gone? It couldn\u0027t be true.\n \n \u0027He did it too, you know, Foaly. Recovered a copy of the Book no less, and he confirmed Short was alive.\u0027\n \n Foaly\u0027s wide brow creased for an instant. \u0027It\u0027s just that...\u0027\n \n \u0027What?\u0027 said Root, suspicion aroused.\n \n \u0027Well, for a moment there, just before the end, his heart rate seemed abnormally fast.\u0027\n \n \u0027Maybe it was a malfunction.\u0027\n \n The centaur was unconvinced. \u0027I doubt it. My bugs don\u0027t have bugs.\u0027\n \n \u0027What other explanation could there be? You still have visuals, don\u0027t you?\u0027\n \n \u0027Yep. Through dead eyes, no doubt about it. Not a spark of electricity in that brain; the camera is running on its own battery.\u0027\n \n \u0027Well, that\u0027s it then. No other explanation.\u0027\n \n Foaly nodded. \u0027It would seem that way. Unless ... No, it\u0027s too fantastic.\u0027\n \n \u0027This is Mulch Diggums we\u0027re talking about here. Nothing is too fantastic.\u0027\n \n Foaly opened his mouth to voice his incredible theory, but before he could speak the shuttle\u0027s bay door slid open.\n \n \u0027We have him!\u0027 said a triumphant voice.\n \n \u0027Yes!\u0027 agreed a second. \u0027Fowl has made a mistake!\u0027\n \n Root swivelled on his chair. It was Argon and Cumulus, the so-called behavioural analysts.\n \n \u0027Oh, we\u0027ve finally decided to earn our retainers, have we?\u0027\n \n But the professors were not so easily intimidated. United by excitement. Cumulus even had the temerity to wave Root\u0027s sarcasm aside. This more than anything else made the commander sit up and take notice.\n \n Argon brushed past Foaly, pressing a laser disk into the console\u0027s player. Artemis Fowl\u0027s face appeared, as seen through Root\u0027s iris-cam.\n \n \u0027We\u0027ll be in touch,\u0027 said the commander\u0027s recorded voice. \u0027Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll see myself out.\u0027\n \n Fowl\u0027s face disappeared momentarily as he rose from his chair. Root lifted his gaze in time for the next chilling statement.\n \n \u0027You do that. But remember this, none of your race has permission to enter here while I\u0027m alive.\u0027\n \n Argon pressed the pause button triumphantly. \u0027There, you see!\u0027\n \n Root\u0027s complexion lost any final traces of pallor.\n \n \u0027There? There what? What do I see?\u0027\n \n Cumulus tutted, as one would at a slow child. A mistake, in retrospect. The commander had him by the pointy beard in under a second.\n \n \u0027Now,\u0027 he said, his voice deceptively calm. \u0027Pretend we\u0027re pushed for time here and just explain it to me without any attitude or comments.\u0027\n \n \u0027The human said we couldn\u0027t enter while he was alive,\u0027 squeaked Cumulus.\n \n \u0027So?\u0027\n \n Argon took up the account. \u0027So ... if we can\u0027t go in while he\u0027s alive ...\"\n \n Root drew a sharp breath. \u0027Then we go in when he\u0027s dead.\u0027\n \n Cumulus and Argon beamed. \u0027Exactly,\u0027 they said in perfect unison.\n \n Root scratched his chin.\n \n \u0027I don\u0027t know. We\u0027re on shaky ground here legally.\u0027\n \n \u0027Not at all,\u0027 argued Cumulus. \u0027It\u0027s elementary grammar. The human specifically stated that entry was forbidden as long as he was alive. That\u0027s tantamount to an invitation when he\u0027s dead.\u0027\n \n The commander wasn\u0027t convinced. \u0027The invitation is implied, at best.\u0027\n \n \u0027No,\u0027 interrupted Foaly. \u0027They\u0027re right. It\u0027s a strong case. Once Fowl is dead, the door is wide open. He said it himself.\u0027\n \n \u0027Maybe.\u0027\n \n \u0027Maybe nothing,\u0027 blurted Foaly. \u0027For heaven\u0027s sake, Julius, how much more do you need? We have a crisis here, in case you hadn\u0027t noticed.\u0027\n \n Root nodded slowly. \u0027One, you\u0027re right. Two, I\u0027m going to run with it. Three, well done, you two. And four, if you ever call me Julius again, Foaly, you\u0027ll be eating your own hooves. Now, get me a line to the Council. I need to get approval for that gold.\u0027\n \n \u0027Right away, Commander Root, your worship.\u0027 Foaly grinned, letting the hoof-eating comment slide for Holly\u0027s sake.\n \n \u0027So we send in the gold,\u0027 muttered Root, thinking aloud. \u0027They send out Holly, we blue-rinse the place and stroll in to reclaim the ransom. Simple.\u0027\n \n \u0027So simple it\u0027s brilliant,\u0027 enthused Argon. \u0027Quite a coup for our profession, wouldn\u0027t you say, Doctor Cumulus?\u0027\n \n Cumulus\u0027s head was spinning with possibilities. \u0027Lecture tours, book deals. Why, the movie rights alone will be worth a fortune.\u0027\n \n \u0027Let those sociologists stuff this in their collective pipe. Puts the kibosh on the deprivation-breeds-antisocial-behaviour chestnut. This Fowl character has never gone hungry in his life.\u0027\n \n \u0027There\u0027s more than one kind of hunger,\u0027 noted Argon.\n \n \u0027Very true. Hunger to succeed. Hunger to dominate. Hunger to -\u0027\n \n Root snapped. \u0027Get out! Get out before I strangle the pair of you. And if I ever hear a word of this repeated on an afternoon talk show, I\u0027ll know where it came from.\u0027\n \n The consultants retreated warily, resolving not to call their agents until they were out of earshot.\n \n \u0027I don\u0027t know if the Council will go for this,\u0027 admitted Root when they\u0027d departed. \u0027It\u0027s a lot of gold.\u0027\n \n Foaly looked up from the console. \u0027How much exactly?\u0027\n \n The commander slid a piece of paper across the console. \u0027That much.\u0027\n \n \u0027That is a lot.\u0027 Foaly whistled. \u0027A tonne. Small unmarked ingots. Twenty-four carat only. Well, at least it\u0027s a nice round weight.\u0027\n \n \u0027Very comforting. I\u0027ll be sure to mention that to the Council. Have you got that line yet?\u0027\n \n The centaur grunted. A negative grunt. Very cheeky really, grunting at a superior officer. Root didn\u0027t have the energy to discipline him, but he made a mental note: when this is over, dock Foaly\u0027s pay for a few decades. He rubbed his eyes exhaustedly. Time lag was beginning to set in. Even though his brain wouldn\u0027t let him sleep because he\u0027d been awake when the time-stop was initiated, his body was crying out for rest.\n \n He rose from the chair, swinging the door wide to let in some air. Stale. Time-stop air. Not even molecules could escape the time-field, much less a human boy.\n \n There was activity by the portal. Lots of it. A swarm of troops gathered around a hovercage. Gudgeon stood at the head of the procession and the entire bunch was heading his way. Root stepped down to meet them.\n \n \u0027What\u0027s this?\u0027 he inquired, none too pleasantly. \u0027A circus?\u0027\n \n Gudgeon\u0027s face was pale, but determined.\n \n \u0027No, Julius. It\u0027s the end of the circus.\u0027\n \n Root nodded. \u0027I see. And these are the clowns?\u0027\n \n Foaly\u0027s head poked through the doorway.\n \n \u0027Pardon me for interrupting your extended circus metaphor, but what the hell is that?\u0027\n \n \u0027Yes, Lieutenant,\u0027 said Root, nodding at the floating hovercage. \u0027What the hell is that?\u0027\n \n Gudgeon bolstered his courage with a few deep breaths. \u0027I\u0027ve taken a leaf from your book, Julius.\u0027\n \n \u0027Is that a fact?\u0027\n \n \u0027Yes. It is. You opted to send in a lapsed creature. So now I\u0027m going to.\u0027\n \n Root smiled dangerously. \u0027You don\u0027t opt to do anything, Lieutenant, not without my say so.\u0027\n \n Gudgeon took an unconscious step backwards.\n \n \u0027I\u0027ve been to the Council, Julius. I have their full backing.\u0027\n \n The commander turned to Foaly. \u0027Is this true?\u0027\n \n \u0027Apparently. It just came through on the outside line. This is Gudgeon\u0027s party now. He told the Council about the ransom demand and you springing Mister Diggums. You know what the elders are like when it comes to parting with gold.\u0027\n \n Root folded his arms. \u0027People told me about you, Gudgeon. They said you\u0027d stab me in the back. I didn\u0027t believe them. I was a fool.\u0027\n \n \u0027This is not about us, Julius. It\u0027s about the mission. What\u0027s inside this cage is our best chance of success.\u0027\n \n \u0027So what\u0027s in the cage? No, don\u0027t tell me. The only other non-magical creature in the Lower Elements. And the first troll we\u0027ve managed to take alive in over a century.\u0027\n \n \u0027Exactly. The perfect creature to flush out our adversary.\u0027\n \n Root\u0027s cheeks glowed with the effort of restraining his anger.\n \n \u0027I don\u0027t believe you\u0027re even considering this.\u0027\n \n \u0027Face it, Julius, it\u0027s the same basic idea as yours.\u0027\n \n \u0027No, it isn\u0027t. Mulch Diggums made his own choices. He knew the risks.\u0027\n \n \u0027Diggums is dead?\u0027\n \n Root rubbed his eyes again. \u0027Yes. It would seem so. A cave-in.\u0027\n \n \u0027That just proves I\u0027m right. A troll won\u0027t be so easily dispatched.\u0027\n \n \u0027It\u0027s a dumb animal, for heaven\u0027s sake! How can a troll follow instructions?\u0027\n \n Gudgeon smiled, newborn confidence peeping through his apprehension.\n \n \u0027What instructions? We just point it at the house and get out of the way. I guarantee you those humans will be begging us to come in and rescue them.\u0027\n \n \u0027And what about my officer?\u0027\n \n \u0027We\u0027ll have the troll back under lock and key long before Captain Short is in any danger.\u0027\n \n \u0027You can guarantee that, can you?\u0027\n \n Gudgeon paused. \u0027That\u0027s a chance I\u0027m willing ... the Council is willing to take.\u0027\n \n \u0027Politics,\u0027 spat Root. \u0027This is all politics to you, Gudgeon. A nice feather in your cap on the way to a Council seat. You make me sick.\u0027\n \n \u0027Be that as it may, we are proceeding with this strategy. The Council have appointed me Acting Commander, so if you can\u0027t put our personal history aside, get the hell out of my way.\u0027\n \n Root stepped aside. \u0027Don\u0027t worry, Commander. I don\u0027t want anything to do with this butchery. The credit is all yours.\u0027\n \n Gudgeon put on his best sincere face. \u0027Julius, despite what you think, I have only the interests of the People at heart.\u0027\n \n \u0027One person in particular,\u0027 snorted Root.\n \n Gudgeon decided to go for the high moral ground.\n \n \u0027I don\u0027t have to stand here listening to this. Every second talking to you is a second wasted.\u0027\n \n Root looked him straight in the eye. \u0027That\u0027s about six hundred years wasted altogether, eh, friend!\u0027\n \n Gudgeon didn\u0027t answer. What could he say? Ambition had a price, and that price was friendship.\n \n Gudgeon turned to his squad, a group of hand-picked sprites loyal only to him. \u0027Get the hovercage over to the avenue. We don\u0027t green-light until I give the word.\u0027\n \n He brushed past Root, eyes looking anywhere except at his erstwhile friend. Foaly wouldn\u0027t let him go without a comment.\n \n \u0027Hey, Gudgeon.\u0027\n \n The Acting Commander couldn\u0027t tolerate that tone, not on his first day.\n \n \u0027You watch your mouth, Foaly. No one is indispensable.\u0027\n \n The centaur chuckled. \u0027Very true. That\u0027s the thing about politics, you get one shot.\u0027\n \n Gudgeon was semi-interested in spite of himself.\n \n \u0027I know if it was me,\u0027 continued Foaly, \u0027and I had one chance, just one chance, to book my behind a seat on that Council, I certainly wouldn\u0027t entrust my future to a troll.\u0027\n \n And suddenly Gudgeon\u0027s new-found confidence evaporated, replaced by a shiny pallor. He wiped his brow, hurrying after the departing hovercage.\n \n \u0027See you tomorrow,\u0027 Foaly called after him. \u0027You\u0027ll be taking out my trash.\u0027\n \n Root laughed. Possibly the first time one of Foaly\u0027s comments had amused him.\n \n \u0027Good man, Foaly.\u0027 He grinned. \u0027Hit that back-stabber where it hurts, right in the ambition.\u0027\n \n \u0027Thanks, Julius.\u0027\n \n The grin disappeared faster than a deep-fried pit slug in the LEP canteen.\n \n \u0027I\u0027ve warned you about the Julius thing, Foaly. Now get that outside line open again. I want that gold ready when Gudgeon\u0027s plan goes awry. Lobby all my supporters on the Council. I\u0027m pretty sure Lope\u0027s one of mine, and Cahartez, possibly Vinyaya. She\u0027s always had a thing for me, devilishly attractive as I am.\u0027\n \n \u0027You\u0027re joking, of course.\u0027\n \n \u0027I never joke,\u0027 said Root, and he said it with a straight face.\n \n Holly had a plan, of sorts. Sneak around shielded, reclaim some fairy weaponry, then cause havoc until Fowl was forced to release her. And if several million Irish pounds\u0027 worth of property damage happened to ensue, well, that was just a bonus.\n \n Holly hadn\u0027t felt so good in years. Her eyes blazed with power and there were sparks sizzling below every centimetre of skin. She had forgotten just how good running hot felt.\n \n Captain Short felt in control now, on the hunt. This was what she was trained to do. When this affair had started, the advantage had been with the Mud People. But now the boot was on the other foot. She was the hunter and they were the prey.\n \n Holly scaled the great staircase, ever vigilant for the giant manservant. That was one individual she wasn\u0027t taking any chances with. If those fingers closed around her skull, she was history, helmet or not, assuming she managed to find a helmet.\n \n The vast house was like a mausoleum - .without a single sign of life inside its vaulted rooms. Spooky portraits though. Each one with Fowl eyes, suspicious and glittering. Holly determined to torch the lot of them when she recovered her Neutrino 2000. Vindictive perhaps, but totally justified considering what Artemis Fowl had put her through.\n \n She scaled the steps swiftly, following the curve around to the upper landing. A slot of pale light peeped from under the last door on the corridor. Holly placed her palm against the wood, feeling for vibration. Activity all right. Shouting and footsteps. Thundering this way.\n \n Holly jumped back, flattening herself against the velveteen wallpaper. Not a moment too soon. A hulking shape burst through the doorway and hurtled down the corridor, leaving a maelstrom of air currents in his wake.\n \n \u0027Juliet!\u0027 he shouted, his sister\u0027s name hanging in the air long after he had disappeared down the stairs.\n \n Don\u0027t worry, Butler, thought Holly. She\u0027s having the time of her life glued to Wrestlemania. But the open door presented a welcome opportunity. She slipped through before the mechanical arm could close it again.\n \n Artemis Fowl was waiting, anti-shield filters cobbled on to his sunglasses.\n \n \u0027Good evening, Captain Short,\u0027 he began, confidence apparently intact. \u0027At the risk of sounding clichéd, I\u0027ve been expecting you.\u0027\n \n Holly didn\u0027t respond, didn\u0027t even look her jailer in the eye. Instead she utilized her training to scan the room, her gaze resting briefly on each surface.\n \n \u0027You are, of course, still bound by the promises made earlier tonight ...\u0027\n \n But Holly wasn\u0027t listening, she was sprinting towards a stainless-steel workbench bolted to the far wall.\n \n \u0027So, basically, our situation hasn\u0027t changed. You are still my hostage.\u0027\n \n \u0027Yeah, yeah, yeah,\u0027 muttered Holly, running her fingers over the rows of confiscated Retrieval equipment. She selected a stealth-coated helmet, slipping it over her pointed ears. The pneumatic pads pumped to cradle her crown. She was safe now. Any further commands given by Fowl meant nothing through the reflective visor. A wire mike slotted down automatically. Contact was immediate.\n \n \u0027... on revolving frequencies. Broadcasting on revolving frequencies. Holly, if you can hear me, take cover.\u0027\n \n Holly recognized Foaly\u0027s voice. Something familiar in a crazy situation.\n \n \u0027Repeat.Take cover. Gudgeon is sending in a ...\u0027\n \n \u0027Something I should know?\u0027 said Artemis.\n \n \u0027Quiet,\u0027 hissed Holly, worried by the tone of Foaly\u0027s usually flippant voice.\n \n \u0027I say again, they are sending in a troll to secure your release.\u0027\n \n Holly started. Gudgeon was calling the shots now. Not good news at all.\n \n Fowl interrupted again.\n \n \u0027It\u0027s not polite, you know. Ignoring your host.\u0027\n \n Holly snarled. \u0027Enough is enough.\u0027\n \n She pulled back her fist, fingers curled in a tight bunch. Artemis didn\u0027t flinch. Why would he? Butler always intervened before punches landed. But then something caught his eye, a large figure running down the stairway on the first-floor monitor. It was Butler.\n \n \u0027That\u0027s right, rich boy,\u0027 said Holly nastily. \u0027You\u0027re on your own this time.\u0027\n \n And before Artemis\u0027s eyes had time to widen, Holly put an extra few kilos of spring in her elbow and whacked her abductor right on the nose.\n \n \u0027Oof,\u0027 he said, collapsing on to his rear end.\n \n \u0027Oh yes! That felt good.\u0027\n \n Holly focused on the voice buzzing in her ear.\n \n \u0027... we\u0027ve been feeding a loop to the outside cameras, so the humans won\u0027t see anything come up the avenue. But it\u0027s on the way, trust me.\u0027\n \n \u0027Foaly. Foaly, come in.\u0027\n \n \u0027Holly? Is that you?\u0027\n \n \u0027The one and only. Foaly, there is no loop. I can see everything that\u0027s going on around here.\u0027\n \n \u0027The cunning little ... He must have rebooted the system.\u0027\n \n The avenue was a hive of fairy activity. Gudgeon was there, haughtily directing his team of sprites. And in the centre of the melee stood a five-metre-tall hovercage, floating on a cushion of air. The cage was directly before the manor door, and the techies were securing a concussor seal to the surrounding wall. When activated, several alloy rods in the seal\u0027s collar would be detonated simultaneously, effectively disintegrating the door. When the dust settled, the troll would have only one place to go into the manor.\n \n Holly checked the other monitors. Butler had managed to drag Juliet from the cell. They had ascended from the cellar level and were just crossing the lobby. Right in the line of fire.\n \n \u0027D\u0027Arvit,\u0027 she swore, crossing to the work surface.\n \n Artemis was propped on his elbows. \u0027You hit me,\u0027 he said in disbelief.\n \n Holly strapped on a set of Hummingbirds.\n \n \u0027That\u0027s right, Fowl. And there\u0027s plenty more where that came from. So stay right where you are, if you know what\u0027s good for you.\u0027\n \n For once in his life, Artemis realized that he didn\u0027t have a snappy answer. He opened his mouth, waiting for his brain to supply the customary pithy comeback. But nothing arrived.\n \n Holly slipped the Neutrino 2000 into its holster.\n \n \u0027That\u0027s right, Mud Boy. Playtime\u0027s over. Time for the professionals to take over. If you\u0027re a good boy I\u0027ll buy you a lolly when I come back.\u0027\n \n And when Holly was long gone, soaring beneath the hallway\u0027s ancient oak beams, Artemis said, \u0027I don\u0027t like lollipops.\u0027\n \n It was a woefully inadequate response, and Artemis was instantly appalled with himself. Pathetic really: I don\u0027t like lollipops. No self-respecting criminal mastermind would be caught dead even using the word lollipops. He really would have to put together a database of witty responses for occasions such as this.\n \n It was quite possible that Artemis would have sat like that for some time, totally detached from the situation at hand, had not the front door imploded, shaking the manor to its foundations. A thing like that is enough to knock the daydreams from anyone\u0027s head.\n \n A sprite alighted before Acting Commander Gudgeon.\n \n \u0027The collar is in place, sir.\u0027\n \n Gudgeon nodded. \u0027Are you sure it\u0027s tight, Captain? I don\u0027t want that troll coming out the wrong way.\u0027\n \n \u0027Tighter \u0027n a goblin\u0027s wallet. There\u0027s not a bubble of air getting through that seal. Tighter \u0027n a stink-worm\u0027s -\u0027\n \n \u0027Very well, Captain,\u0027 interrupted Gudgeon hurriedly, before the sprite could complete his graphic analogy.\n \n Beside them the hovercage shook violently, almost toppling the container from its air cushion.\n \n \u0027We better blow that sucker, Commander. If we don\u0027t let him outta there soon, my boys\u0027re gonna spend the next week scraping ...\u0027\n \n \u0027Fine, Captain, fine. Blow it. Blow it for goodness\u0027 sake.\u0027\n \n Gudgeon hurried behind the blast shield, scribbling a note on his palmtop\u0027s LCD screen. Memo: Remind the sprites to watch their language. After all, I am a Commander now.\n \n The foul-mouthed captain in question turned to the hovercage\u0027s cab driver.\n \n \u0027Blow \u0027er, Chix. Blow the door off its damn hinges.\u0027\n \n \u0027Yessir. Off its damn hinges. That\u0027s a roger.\u0027\n \n Gudgeon winced. There\u0027d be a general meeting tomorrow. First thing. By then he\u0027d have the commander\u0027s icon on his lapel. Even a sprite might be less likely to curse, with the triple acorn logo winking in his face.\n \n Chix pulled down his shrapnel goggles, even though the cab had a quartz windscreen. The goggles were cool. Girls loved them. Or so the driver thought. In his mind\u0027s eye he saw himself as a grim-faced daredevil. Sprites were like that. Give a fairy a pair of wings and he thinks he\u0027s God\u0027s gift to women. But Chix Verbil\u0027s ill-fated quest to impress the dames is, once again, another story. In this particular tale, he serves only one purpose. And that is to melodramatically push the detonate button. Which he does, with great aplomb.\n \n Two dozen controlled charges detonated in their chambers, driving two dozen alloy cylinders out of their mounts at over a thousand miles per hour. Upon impact, each bar pulverized the contact area plus the surrounding fifteen centimetres, effectively blowing the door off its damn hinges. As the captain would say.\n \n When the dust settled, the handlers winched back the containment wall inside the cage and began hammering the side panels with the flats of their hands.\n \n Gudgeon peeped out from behind the blast shield.\n \n \u0027All clear, Captain?\u0027\n \n \u0027Just a damn second, Commander. Chix? How\u0027re we doin\u0027?\u0027\n \n Chix checked the cab\u0027s monitor.\n \n \u0027He\u0027s movin\u0027. The hammerin\u0027 is spookin\u0027 him. The claws are comin\u0027 out. My, he\u0027s a big sucker. I wouldn\u0027t wanna be that Recon babe if she gets in the way of this.\u0027\n \n Gudgeon felt a momentary pang of guilt, which he dispelled with his favourite daydream - a vision of himself sinking into a beige-velour Council seat.\n \n The cage heaved violently, almost dislodging Chix from his seat. He held on like a rodeo rider.\n \n \u0027Woah! He\u0027s on the move. Lock and load, boys. I have a feeling that any second we\u0027re going to be gettin\u0027 a cry for help.\u0027\n \n Gudgeon didn\u0027t bother locking and loading. He preferred to leave that sort of thing to the foot soldiers. The Acting Commander considered himself too important to be risked in an insecure situation. For the good of the People in general, it was better he remain outside the op zone.\n \n Butler took the stairs four at a time. It was possibly the first time he had ever abandoned Master Artemis in a crisis. But Juliet was family, and there was obviously something seriously wrong with his baby sister. That fairy had said something to her and now she was just sitting in the cell giggling. Butler feared the worst. If anything were to happen to Juliet, he didn\u0027t know how he\u0027d live with himself.\n \n He felt a dribble of sweat slide down the crown of his shaven head. This whole situation was shooting off in bizarre directions. Fairies, magic, and now a hostage loose in the manor. How could he be expected to control things? It took a four-man team to guard the lowliest politician, but he was expected to contain this impossible situation on his own.\n \n Butler sprinted down the corridor into what had until recently been Captain Short\u0027s cell. Juliet was sprawled on the cot, enraptured by a concrete wall.\n \n \u0027What are you doing?\u0027 he gasped, drawing the Sig Sauer nine-millimetre with practised ease.\n \n His sister barely spared him a glance. \u0027Quiet, you big ape. Louie the Love Machine is on. He ain\u0027t so tough, I could take him.\u0027\n \n Butler blinked. She was talking gibberish. Obviously drugged.\n \n \u0027Let\u0027s go. Artemis wants us upstairs in the situations room.\u0027\n \n Juliet pointed a manicured finger at the wall.\n \n \u0027Artemis can wait. This is for the intercontinental title. And it\u0027s a grudge match. Louie ate the Hogman\u0027s pet piggie.\u0027\n \n The manservant studied the wall. It was definitely blank. He didn\u0027t have time for this.\n \n \u0027Right. Let\u0027s go,\u0027 he growled, slinging his sister over a broad shoulder.\n \n \u0027Nooo. You big bully,\u0027 she protested, hammering his back with tiny fists. \u0027Not now. Hogman! Hogmaaaan!\u0027\n \n Butler ignored the objections, settling into a loping run. Who the hell was this Hogman person? One of her boyfriends no doubt. He was going to keep closer tabs on callers to the lodge in future.\n \n \u0027Butler? Pick up.\u0027\n \n It was Artemis, on the hand-held. Butler jiggled his sister up a foot so he could reach his belt.\n \n \u0027Lollipops!\u0027 barked his employer.\n \n \u0027Say again. I thought you said -\u0027\n \n \u0027Eh ... I mean get out of there. Take cover! Take cover!\u0027\n \n Take cover? The military term didn\u0027t sound right coming out of Master Artemis\u0027s mouth. Like a diamond ring in a Lucky Bag.\n \n \u0027Take cover?\u0027\n \n \u0027Yes, Butler. Cover. I thought speaking in primal terms would be the quickest route to your cognitive functions. Obviously I was mistaken.\u0027\n \n That was more like it. Butler scanned the hall for a nook to duck into. Not much choice. The only shelter was provided by the suits of medieval armour punctuating the walls. The manservant ducked into the alcove behind a fourteenth-century knight complete with lance and mace.\n \n Juliet tapped the breastplate.\n \n \u0027You think you\u0027re mean? I could take you with one hand.\u0027\n \n \u0027Quiet,\u0027 hissed Butler.\n \n He held his breath and listened. Something was approaching the main door. Something big. Butler leaned out far enough to get one eye on the lobby ...\n \n Then you could say that the doorway exploded. But that particular verb doesn\u0027t do the action justice. Rather, it shattered into infinitesimal pieces. Butler had seen something like this once before when a force-seven earthquake had rippled through a Colombian drug lord\u0027s estate seconds before he had been scheduled to blow it up. This was slightly different. More localized. Very professional. It was classic anti-terrorist tactics. Hit \u0027em with smoke and sonics, then go in while the targets were disoriented. Whatever was coming, it would be bad. He was certain of it. He was absolutely right.\n \n Dust clouds settled slowly, depositing a pale sheet on the Tunisian rug. Madam Fowl would have been furious, if she ever put so much as a toe outside the attic door. Butler\u0027s instincts told him to move. Zigzag across the ground floor, make for the higher ground. Stay low to minimize the target. This would be the perfect time to do it, before visibility cleared. Any second now, a hail of bullets would be whistling through the archway, and the last place he wanted to be was pinned down on a lower level.\n \n And on any other day Butler would have moved. He would\u0027ve been halfway up that stairway before his brain had time for second thoughts. But today he had his baby sister over his shoulder spouting gibberish, and the last thing he wanted to do was expose her to murderous assault fire. With Juliet in the state she was in, she\u0027d probably challenge the fairy commandos to a tag-wrestling match. And though his sister talked tough, she was just a kid really. No match for trained military personnel. So Butler hunkered down, propped Juliet against a tapestry behind a suit of armour and checked his safety catch. Off. Good. Come and get me, fairy boys.\n \n Something moved in the dust haze. It was immediately obvious to Butler that the something wasn\u0027t human. The manservant had been on too many safaris not to recognize an animal when he saw it. He studied the creature\u0027s gait. Possibly simian. Similar upper-body structure to an ape, but bigger than any primate Butler had ever seen. If it was an ape, then his handgun wasn\u0027t going to be of much use. You could put five rounds in the skull of a bull ape and he\u0027d still have time to eat you before his brain realized he was dead.\n \n But it wasn\u0027t an ape. Apes didn\u0027t have night eyes. This creature did. Glowing crimson pupils, half-hidden behind shaggy forelocks. Tusks too, but not elephantine. These were curved, with serrated edges. Gutting weapons. Butler felt a tingle low in his stomach. He\u0027d had the feeling once before. On his first day at the Swiss academy. It was fear.\n \n The creature stepped clear of the dust haze. Butler gasped. Again, his first since the academy. This was like no adversary he\u0027d ever faced before. The manservant realized instantly what the fairies had done. They had sent in a primal hunter. A creature with no interest in magic or rules. A thing that would simply kill anything in its way, regardless of species. This was the perfect predator. That much was clear from the meat-ripping points on its teeth, from the dried gore crusted beneath its claws and from the distilled hatred spilling from its eyes.\n \n The troll shambled forwards, squinting through the chandelier light. Yellowed claws scraped along the marble tiling, throwing up sparks in their wake. It was sniffing now, snorting curious breaths, head cocked to one side. Butler had seen that pose before - on the snouts of starved pit bulls, just before their Russian handlers set them loose on a bear hunt.\n \n The shaggy head froze, its snout pointed directly at Butler\u0027s hiding place. It was no coincidence. The manservant peeked out between the chain-mail fingers of a gauntlet. Now came the stalk. Once a scent had been acquired, the predator would attempt a slow silent approach, before the lightning strike.\n \n But apparently the troll had not read the predator\u0027s handbook, because it didn\u0027t bother with the stealth approach, jumping directly to the lightning strike. Moving faster than Butler would have believed possible, the troll sprang across the lobby, brushing the medieval armour aside as though it were a shop mannequin.\n \n Juliet blinked. \u0027Ooh,\u0027 she gasped. \u0027It\u0027s Bigfoot Bob. Canadian champion nineteen ninety-eight. I thought you were in the Andes, looking for your relatives.\u0027\n \n Butler didn\u0027t bother to correct her. His sister wasn\u0027t lucid. At least she would die happy. While his brain was contemplating this morbid observation, Butler\u0027s gun hand was coming up.\n \n He squeezed the trigger as rapidly as the Sig Sauer\u0027s mechanism would allow. Two in the chest, three between the eyes. That was the plan. He got the chest shots in, but the troll interfered before Butler could complete the formation. The interference took the form of scything tusks that ducked below Butler\u0027s guard. They coiled around his trunk, slicing through his Kevlar reinforced jacket like a razor through rice paper.\n \n Butler felt a cold pain as the serrated ivory pierced his chest. He knew immediately that the wound was fatal. His breath came hard. That was a lung gone, and gouts of blood were matting the troll\u0027s fur. His blood. No one could lose that amount and live. Nevertheless, the pain was instantly replaced by a curious euphoria. Some form of natural anaesthetic injected through channels in the beast\u0027s tusks. More dangerous than the deadliest poison. In minutes Butler would not only stop struggling, but go giggling to his grave.\n \n The manservant fought against the narcotics in his system, struggling furiously in the troll\u0027s grip. But it was no use. His fight was over almost before it had begun.\n \n The troll grunted, flipping the limp human body over his head. Butler\u0027s burly frame collided with the wall at a speed human bones were never meant to withstand. The bricks cracked from floor to ceiling. Butler\u0027s spine went too. Now, even if the blood loss didn\u0027t get him, paralysis would.\n \n Juliet was still enthralled by the mesmer.\n \n \u0027Come on, brother. Get off the canvas. We all know you\u0027re faking.\u0027\n \n The troll paused, some basic curiosity piqued by the lack of fear. He would have suspected a trick, if he could have formulated such a complicated thought. But in the end, appetite won out. This creature smelled flesh. Fresh and tender. Flesh from above ground was different. Laced with surface smells. Once you\u0027ve had open-air meat, it\u0027s hard to go back. The troll ran a tongue over his incisors and reached out a shaggy hand ...\n \n Holly tucked the Hummingbirds close to her torso, dropping into a controlled dive. She skimmed the banisters, emerging into the portico below a stained-glass dome. The time-stop light filtered unnaturally, splitting into thick azure shafts.\n \n Light, thought Holly. The helmet high-beams worked before, there was no reason why they wouldn\u0027t work again. It was too late for the male, he was a bag of broken bones. But the female, she still had a few seconds left before the troll split her open.\n \n Holly spiralled down through the faux light, searching her helmet console for the Sonix button. Sonix were generally used on canines, but in this case it might provide a moment\u0027s distraction. Enough to get her to ground level.\n \n The troll was reaching in towards Juliet underhand. It was a move generally reserved for the defenceless. The claws would curl in below the ribs, rupturing the heart. Minimum damage to the flesh and no last-minute tension to toughen the meat.\n \n Holly activated her Sonix ... and nothing happened. Not good. Generally your average troll would be at the very least irritated by the ultra-high-frequency tone. But this particular beast didn\u0027t even shake his shaggy head. There were a couple of possibilities: one, the helmet was malfunctioning; two, this troll was deaf as the proverbial post. Unfortunately, Holly had no way of knowing as the tones were inaudible to fairy ears.\n \n Whatever the problem, it forced Holly to adopt a strategy she would rather not have resorted to. Direct contact. All to save a human\u0027s life. She\u0027d gone section eight. Without a doubt.\n \n Holly jerked the throttle, straight from fourth to reverse. Not very good for the gears. She\u0027d get a dressing-down from the mechanics for that, in the unlikely event she actually survived this never-ending nightmare. The effect of this gear-crunching was to flip her around in mid-air, so that her boot heels were pointed directly at the troll\u0027s head. Holly winced. Two entanglements with the same troll. Unbelievable.\n \n Her heels caught the beast square on the crown of its head. At that speed, there was at least half a tonne of G-force behind the contact. Only the reinforced ribbing in her suit prevented Holly\u0027s leg bones from shattering. Even so, she heard her knee pop. The pain clawed its way to her forehead. Ruined her recovery manoeuvre too. Instead of repelling herself to a safe altitude, Holly crumpled on to the troll\u0027s back, becoming instantly entangled in the ropy fur.\n \n The troll was suitably annoyed. Not only had something distracted it from dinner, but now that something was nestled in its fur, along with the cleaner slugs. The beast straightened, reaching a clawed hand over its own shoulder. The curved nails raked Holly\u0027s helmet, scoring parallel grooves in the alloy. Juliet was safe for the moment, but Holly had taken her place on the endangered-individuals list.\n \n The troll squeezed tighter, somehow securing a grip on the helmet\u0027s anti-friction coating, which, according to Foaly, was impossible to grip. Serious words would be had. If not in this life, then definitely the next.\n \n Captain Short found herself being hoisted aloft to face her old enemy. Holly struggled to concentrate through the pain and confusion. Her leg was swinging like a pendulum, and the troll\u0027s breath was breaking over her face in rancid waves.\n \n There had been a plan, hadn\u0027t there? Surely she didn\u0027t fly down here just to curl up and die. There must have been a strategy. All those years in the Academy must have taught her something. Whatever her plan had been, it floated just out of reach somewhere between pain and shock. Out of reach.\n \n \u0027The lights, Holly ...\u0027\n \n A voice in her head. Probably talking to herself. An out-of-head experience. Ha ha. She must remember to tell Foaly about this ... Foaly?\n \n \u0027Hit the lights, Holly. If those tusks get to work, you\u0027ll be dead before the magic can kick in.\u0027\n \n \u0027Foaly? Is that you?\u0027 Holly may have said this aloud, or she may just have thought it. She wasn\u0027t sure.\n \n \u0027The tunnel high beams, Captain!\u0027 A different voice. Not so cuddly. \u0027Hit the button now! That\u0027s an order!\u0027\n \n Oops. It was Root. She was falling down on the job again. First Hamburg, then Martina Franca, now this.\n \n \u0027Yessir,\u0027 she mumbled, trying to sound professional.\n \n \u0027Press it! Now, Captain Short!\u0027\n \n Holly looked the troll straight in its merciless eyes and pressed the button. Very melodramatic. Or it would have been, if the lights had worked. Unfortunately for Holly, in her haste she\u0027d grabbed one of the helmets cannibalized by Artemis Fowl. Hence no Sonix, no filters and no tunnel beams. The halogen bulbs were still installed, but the wires had come loose during Artemis\u0027s investigations.\n \n \u0027Oh dear,\u0027 breathed Holly.\n \n \u0027Oh dear!\u0027 barked Root. \u0027What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\u0027\n \n \u0027The beams are off-line,\u0027 explained Foaly.\n \n \u0027Oh ...\u0027 Root\u0027s voice trailed off. What more was there to say?\n \n Holly squinted at the troll. If you didn\u0027t know trolls were dumb animals, you\u0027d swear the beast was grinning. Standing there with blood dripping from various chest wounds, grinning. Captain Short didn\u0027t like being grinned at.\n \n \u0027Laugh this off,\u0027 she said, and butted the troll with the only weapon available to her. Her helmeted head.\n \n Valiant undoubtedly, but about as effective as trying to cut down a tree with a feather. Luckily, the ill-advised blow had a side effect. For a split second, two strands of conductor filament connected, sending power flooding to one of the tunnel beams. Four-hundred watts of white light blasted through the troll\u0027s crimson eyes, dispatching lightning rods of agony to the brain.\n \n \u0027Heh heh,\u0027 mumbled Holly, in the second before the troll convulsed involuntarily. Its spasms sent her spinning across the parquet floor, leg jittering along behind her.\n \n The wall was approaching at an alarming speed. Maybe, thought Holly hopefully, this will be one of those impacts where you don\u0027t feel any pain until later. No, replied her pessimistic side, afraid not. She slammed into a Norman narrative tapestry, bringing it tumbling down on top of her. Pain was immediate and overwhelming.\n \n \u0027Ooof,\u0027 grunted Foaly. \u0027I felt that. Visuals are shot. Pain sensors went right off the scale. Your lungs are busted, Captain. We\u0027re going to lose you for a while. But don\u0027t worry, Holly, your magic should be kicking in already.\u0027\n \n Holly felt the blue tingle of magic scurrying to her various injuries. Thank the gods for acorns. But it was too little too late. The pain was way beyond her threshold. Just before unconsciousness claimed her, Holly\u0027s hand flopped from beneath the tapestry. It landed on Butler\u0027s arm, touching the bare skin. Amazingly, the human wasn\u0027t dead. A dogged pulse forced the blood through smashed limbs.\n \n Heal, thought Holly. And the magic scurried down her fingers.\n \n The troll faced a dilemma - which female to eat first. Choices, choices. This decision was not made any easier by the lingering agony buzzing around its shaggy head, or the cluster of bullets lodged in the fatty chest tissue. Eventually it settled on the surface dweller. Soft human meat. No dense fairy muscle to chew through.\n \n The beast squatted low, tilting the girl\u0027s chin with one yellowed talon. A pulsing jugular looped lazily down the length of her neck. The heart or the neck? the troll wondered. The neck, it was closer. It turned the talon sideways, so that the edge pressed against soft human flesh. One sharp swipe and the girl\u0027s own heartbeat would drive the blood from her body.\n \n Butler woke up, which was a surprise in itself. He knew immediately that he was alive, because of the searing pain permeating every cubic centimetre of his body. This was not good. Alive he may have been, but considering the fact that his neck had a one-eighty twist on it, he\u0027d never so much as walk the dog again, not to mention rescue his sister.\n \n The manservant twiddled his fingers. Hurt like hell, but at least there was movement. It was amazing that he had any motor functions at all, considering the trauma his spinal column had suffered. His toes seemed all right too, but that could have been phantom response, given that he couldn\u0027t actually see them.\n \n The bleeding from his chest wound appeared to have stopped and he was thinking straight. All in all, he was in much better shape than he had any right to be. What in heaven\u0027s name was going on here?\n \n Butler noticed something. There were blue sparks dancing along his torso. He must be hallucinating, creating pleasant images to distract himself from the inevitable. A very realistic hallucination, it must be said.\n \n The sparks congregated at trauma points, sinking into the skin. Butler shuddered. This was no hallucination. Something extraordinary was happening here. Magical.\n \n Magic? That rang a bell in his recently reassembled cranium. Fairy magic. Something was healing his wounds. He twisted his head, wincing at the grate of sliding vertebrae. There was a hand resting on his forearm. Sparks flowed from the slim elfin fingers, intuitively targeting bruises, breaks or ruptures. There were a lot of injuries to be dealt with, but the tiny sparks handled it all quickly and effectively. Like an army of mystical beavers repairing storm damage.\n \n Butler could actually feel his bones knitting and the blood retreating from semi-congealed scabs. His head twisted involuntarily as his vertebrae slid into their niches, and strength returned in a rush as magic reproduced the three litres of blood lost through his chest wound.\n \n Butler jumped to his feet - actually jumped. He was himself again. No. It was more than that. He was as strong as he had ever been. Strong enough to have another crack at that beast hunkered over his baby sister.\n \n He felt his rejuvenated heart speed up like the stroke of an outboard motor. Calm, Butler told himself. Passion is the enemy of efficiency. But calm or no, the situation was desperate. This beast had already effectively killed him once, and this time round he didn\u0027t even have the Sig Sauer. His own skills aside, it would be nice to have a weapon. Something with a bit of weight to it. His boot clinked on a metallic object. Butler glanced down at the debris strewn in the troll\u0027s wake ... Perfect.\n \n There was nothing but snow on the viewscreen. \u0027Come on,\u0027 urged Root. \u0027Hurry up!\u0027\n \n Foaly elbowed past his superior.\n \n \u0027Maybe if you didn\u0027t insist on blocking all the circuit boards.\u0027\n \n Root shuffled out of the way grudgingly. In his mind it was the circuit boards\u0027 fault for being behind him. The centaur\u0027s head disappeared into an access panel.\n \n \u0027Anything?\u0027\n \n \u0027Nothing. Just interference.\u0027\n \n Root slapped the screen. Not a good idea. First, because there was not one chance in a million that it would actually help, and second, because plasma screens grow extremely hot after prolonged use.\n \n \u0027D\u0027Arvit!\u0027\n \n \u0027Don\u0027t touch that screen, by the way.\u0027\n \n \u0027Oh, ha ha. We have time for jokes now, do we?\u0027\n \n \u0027No, actually. Anything?\u0027\n \n The snow settled into recognizable shapes.\n \n \u0027That\u0027s it, hold it there. We\u0027ve got a signal.\u0027\n \n \u0027I\u0027ve activated the secondary camera. Plain old video, I\u0027m afraid, but it\u0027ll have to do.\u0027\n \n Root didn\u0027t comment. He was watching the screen. This must be a movie. It couldn\u0027t be real life.\n \n \u0027So what\u0027s going on in there? Anything interesting?\u0027\n \n Root tried to answer, but his soldier\u0027s vocabulary just didn\u0027t have the superlatives.\n \n \u0027What? What is it?\u0027\n \n The commander made an attempt. \u0027It\u0027s ... the human ... I\u0027ve never ... Oh, forget it, Foaly.You\u0027re going to have to see this for yourself.\u0027\n \n Holly watched the entire episode through a gap in the tapestry folds. If she hadn\u0027t seen it, she wouldn\u0027t have believed it. In fact, it wasn\u0027t until she\u0027d reviewed the VT for her report that she was certain the whole thing wasn\u0027t a hallucination brought on by a near-death experience. As it was, the video sequence became something of a legend, initially doing the rounds on the Amateur Home Movies cable shows and ending up on the LEP Academy Hand-to-hand curriculum.\n \n The human, Butler, was strapping on a medieval suit of armour. Incredible as it seemed, he apparently intended going toe to toe with the troll. Holly tried to warn him, tried to make some sound, but the magic hadn\u0027t yet reinflated her crushed lungs.\n \n Butler closed his visor, hefting a vicious mace.\n \n \u0027Now,\u0027 he grunted through the grille. \u0027I\u0027ll show you what happens when someone lays a hand on my sister.\u0027\n \n The human twirled the mace as though it were a cheerleader\u0027s baton, ramming it home between the troll\u0027s shoulder blades. A blow like that, while not fatal, certainly distracted the troll from its intended victim.\n \n Butler planted his foot just above the creature\u0027s haunches and tugged the weapon free. It relinquished its grip with a sickly sucking sound. He skipped backwards, settling into a defensive stance.\n \n The troll rounded on him, all ten talons sliding out to their full extent. Drops of venom glistened from the tip of each tusk. Playtime was over. But there would be no lightning strike this time. The beast was wary, it had been hurt. This latest attacker would be afforded the same respect as another male of the species. As far as the troll was concerned, his territory was being encroached on. And there was only one way of solving a dispute of this nature. The same way that trolls solved every dispute ...\n \n \u0027I must warn you,\u0027 said Butler, straight-faced. \u0027I am armed and prepared to use deadly force if necessary.\u0027\n \n Holly would have groaned if she could. Banter! The human was trying to engage a troll in macho repartee! Then Captain Short realized her mistake. The words weren\u0027t important, it was the tone he employed. Calm, soothing. Like a trainer with a spooked unicorn.\n \n \u0027Step away from the female. Easy now.\u0027\n \n The troll ballooned its cheeks and howled. Scare tactics. Testing the waters. Butler didn\u0027t flinch.\n \n \u0027Yeah, yeah. Real scary. Now just back out of the door, and I won\u0027t have to cut you into little pieces.\u0027\n \n The troll snorted, miffed by this reaction. Generally his roar sent whatever creature was facing it scurrying down the tunnel.\n \n \u0027One step at a time. Nice and slow. Easy there, big fellow.\u0027\n \n You could almost see it in the troll\u0027s eyes. A flicker of uncertainty. Maybe this human was ...\n \n And that was when Butler struck. He danced under the tusks, hammering home a devastating uppercut with his medieval weapon. The troll staggered backwards, talons flailing wildly. But it was too late: Butler had stepped out of reach, scooting across to the other side of the corridor.\n \n The troll lumbered after him, spitting dislodged teeth from pulped gums. Butler sank to his knees, sliding and turning, the polished floor bearing him like an ice skater. He ducked and pirouetted, facing his pursuer.\n \n \u0027Guess what I found?\u0027 he said, raising the Sig Sauer.\n \n No chest shots this time. Butler laid in the rest of the automatic\u0027s clip in a ten-centimetre diameter between the troll\u0027s eyes. Unfortunately for Butler, due to millennia spent butting each other, trolls have developed a thick ridge of bone covering their brows. So his textbook spread failed to penetrate the skull, in spite of the Teflon-coated load.\n \n However, ten Devastator slugs can\u0027t be ignored by any creature on the planet, and the troll was no exception. The bullets beat a sledgehammer tattoo on its cranium causing instant concussion. The animal staggered backwards, slapping at its own forehead. Butler was after it in a heartbeat, pinning one shaggy foot beneath the mace spikes.\n \n The troll was concussed, blinded by blood, and lame. A normal person would feel a shard of remorse, but not Butler. He\u0027d seen too many men gored by injured animals. Now was the dangerous time. It was no time for mercy, it was time to terminate with extreme prejudice.\n \n Holly could only watch helplessly as the human took careful aim and delivered a series of crippling blows to the stricken creature. First he took out the tendons, bringing the troll to its knees, then he abandoned the mace and went to work with gauntleted hands, perhaps deadlier than the mace had been. The unfortunate troll fought back pathetically, even managing to land a few glancing blows. But they failed to penetrate the antique armour. Meanwhile Butler toiled like a surgeon. Working on the assumption that the troll and human physiques were basically the same, he rained blow after blow on the dumb creature, reducing it to a heap of quivering fur in so many seconds. It was pitiful to watch. And the manservant wasn\u0027t finished yet. He stripped off the bloodied gauntlets, loading a fresh clip into the handgun.\n \n \u0027Let\u0027s see how much bone you have under your chin.\u0027\n \n \u0027No,\u0027 gasped Holly, with the first breath in her body. \u0027Don\u0027t.\u0027\n \n Butler ignored her, jamming the barrel beneath the troll\u0027s jaw.\n \n \u0027Don\u0027t do it ...You owe me.\u0027\n \n Butler paused. Juliet was alive, it was true. Confused certainly, but alive. He thumbed the hammer on his pistol. Every brain cell in his head screamed for him to pull the trigger. But Juliet was alive.\n \n \u0027You owe me, human.\u0027\n \n Butler sighed. He\u0027d regret this later.\n \n \u0027Very well, Captain. The beast lives to fight another day. Lucky for him, I\u0027m in a good mood.\u0027\n \n Holly made a noise. It was somewhere between a whimper and a chuckle.\n \n \u0027Now let\u0027s get rid of our hairy friend.\u0027\n \n Butler rolled the unconscious troll on to an armour trolley, dragging it to the devastated doorway. With a huge heave, he jettisoned the lot into the suspended night.\n \n \u0027And don\u0027t come back,\u0027 he shouted.\n \n \u0027Amazing,\u0027 said Root.\n \n \u0027Tell me about it,\u0027 agreed Foaly.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/81/242.html","bookId":370,"book":{"id":370,"title":"Artemis Fowl精灵的赎金","description":"简介： 法尔家族是国际上赫赫有名的传奇世家，家族中的阿特米斯法尔更是一个人小鬼大的奇才。自从父亲和二十五万罐可乐一同消失在冰天雪地里之后，家族重担便落到小阿特米斯肩上。为了复兴家业，阿特米斯开始全世界搜寻传说中的小精灵，在获得了精灵世界的至宝《精灵之书》后，...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12890041089f0f8.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/81","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM"}}
