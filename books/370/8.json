{"id":14702,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 7 Mulch","content":"TIME to introduce a new character to our otherworldly pageant. Well, not strictly speaking a new character. We have encountered him before, in the LEP booking line. On remand for numerous larcenies: Mulch Diggums, the kleptomaniac dwarf. A dubious individual, even by Artemis Fowl\u0027s standards. As if this account didn\u0027t already suffer from an overdose of amoral individuals.\\n\\n \\n\\n Born to a typical dwarf cavern-dwelling family, Mulch had decided early that mining was not for him and resolved to put his talents to another use, namely digging and entering, generally entering Mud People\u0027s property. Of course this meant forfeiting his magic. Dwellings were sacred. If you broke that rule, you had to be prepared to accept the consequences. Mulch didn\u0027t mind. He didn\u0027t care much for magic anyway. There had never been much use for it down the mines.\\n\\n \\n\\n Things had gone pretty well for a few centuries, and he\u0027d built up quite a lucrative above-ground memorabilia business. That was until he\u0027d tried to sell the Jules Rimet Cup to an undercover LEP operative. From then on his luck had turned, and he\u0027d been arrested over twenty times to date. A total of 300 years in and out of prison.\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch had a prodigious appetite for tunnelling, and that, unfortunately, is a literal translation. For those unfamiliar with the mechanics of dwarf tunnelling, I shall endeavour to explain them as tastefully as possible. Like some members of the reptile family, dwarf males can unhinge their jaws, allowing them to ingest several kilos of earth a second. This material is processed by a super-efficient metabolism, stripped of any useful minerals and ... ejected at the other end, as it were. Charming.\\n\\n \\n\\n At present, Mulch was languishing in a stone-walled cell in LEP Central. At least, he was trying to project an image of a languishing, unperturbed kind of dwarf. Actually, he was quaking in his steel-toe-capped boots.\\n\\n \\n\\n The goblin/dwarf turf war was flaring up at the moment and some bright spark LEP elf had seen fit to put him in a cell with a gang of psyched-up goblins. An oversight perhaps. More likely a spot of revenge for trying to pick his arresting officer\u0027s pocket in the booking line.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027So, dwarf,\u0027 sneered the head-honcho goblin, a wart-faced fellow covered in tattoos. \u0027How come you don\u0027t chew your way outta here?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch rapped on the walls. \u0027Solid rock.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n The goblin laughed. \u0027So what? Can\u0027t be any harder than your dwarf skull.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n His cronies laughed. So did Mulch. He thought it might be wise. Wrong.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You laughin\u0027 at me, dwarf?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch stopped laughing.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027With you,\u0027 he corrected. \u0027I\u0027m laughing with you. That skull joke was pretty funny.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n The goblin advanced until his slimy nose was a centimetre from Mulch\u0027s own. \u0027You pay-tron-izin\u0027 me, dwarf?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch swallowed, calculating. If he unhinged now, he could probably swallow the leader before the others reacted. Still, goblins were murder on the digestion. Very bony.\\n\\n \\n\\n The goblin conjured up a fireball around his fist. \u0027I asked you a question, stumpy.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch could feel every sweat gland on his body pop into instant overdrive. Dwarfs did not like fire. They didn\u0027t even like thinking about flames. Unlike the rest of the fairy races, dwarfs had no desire to live above ground. Too close to the sun. Ironic for someone in the Mud People Possession Liberation business.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027N-no need for that,\u0027 he stammered. \u0027I was just trying to be friendly.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Friendly,\u0027 scoffed wart-face. \u0027Your kind don\u0027t know the meanin\u0027 of the word. Cowardly back-stabbers, the lot of you.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch nodded diplomatically. \u0027We have been known to be a bit treacherous.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027A bit treacherous! A bit treacherous! My brother Phlegm was ambushed by a crowd of dwarfs disguised as dung heaps! He\u0027s still in traction!\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch nodded sympathetically. \u0027The old dung heap ruse. Disgraceful. One of the reasons I don\u0027t associate with the Brotherhood.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Wart-face twirled the fireball between his fingers. \u0027There are two things under this world that I really despise.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch had a feeling that he was about to find out what they were.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027One is a stinkin\u0027 dwarf.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n No surprises there.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027And the other is a traitor to his own kind. And from what I hear, you fall neatly into both categories.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch smiled weakly. \u0027Just my luck.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Luck ain\u0027t got nothin\u0027 to do with it. Fortune delivered you into my hands.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n On another day, Mulch might have pointed out that luck and fortune were basically the same thing. Not today.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You like fire, dwarf?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch shook his head.\\n\\n \\n\\n Wart-face grinned.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Now ain\u0027t that a shame, \u0027cause any second now I\u0027m going to ram this here fireball down your throat.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n The dwarf swallowed drily. Wasn\u0027t it just typical of the Dwarf Brotherhood? What do dwarfs hate? Fire. Who are the only creatures with the ability to conjure fireballs? Goblins. So who did the dwarfs pick a fight with? What a real no-brainer.\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch backed up to the wall.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Careful there. We could all go up.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not us,\u0027 grinned wart-face, snorting the fireball up two elongated nostrils. \u0027Completely fireproof.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch was perfectly aware what would happen next. He\u0027d seen it too many times in the back alleys. A group of goblins would corner a stray brother dwarf, pin him down, and then the leader would give him the double barrels straight in the face.\\n\\n \\n\\n Wart-face\u0027s nostrils quivered as he prepared to vent the inhaled fireball. Mulch quailed. There was only one chance. The goblins had made a basic mistake. They\u0027d forgotten to pin his arms.\\n\\n \\n\\n The goblin drew a breath through his mouth, then closed it. More exhalation pressure for the fire stream. He tilted his head back, pointing his nose at the dwarf, and let fly. Quick as a flash, Mulch jammed his thumbs up wart-face\u0027s nostrils. Disgusting, yes, but definitely better than being dwarf kebab.\\n\\n \\n\\n The fireball had nowhere to go. It rebounded on the balls of Mulch\u0027s thumbs and ricocheted back into the goblin\u0027s head. The tear ducts provided the path of least resistance, so the flames compressed into pressurized streams, erupting just below the goblin\u0027s eyes. A sea of flame spread across the cell roof.\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch withdrew his thumbs and, after a quick wipe, thrust them in his mouth, allowing the natural balm in his saliva to begin the healing process. Of course if he\u0027d still had his magic, he could have just wished the scorched digits better. But that was the price you paid for a life of crime.\\n\\n \\n\\n Wart-face didn\u0027t look so good. Smoke was leaking from every orifice in his head. Flameproof goblins may be, but the errant fireball had given his tubes a good scouring. He swayed like a strand of seaweed, then collapsed face down on the concrete floor. Something crunched. Probably a big goblin nose.\\n\\n \\n\\n The other gang members did not react favourably.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Look what he did to the boss!\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027That stinkin\u0027 stump.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s fry \u0027im.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch backed up even further. He\u0027d been hoping the remaining goblins would lose their nerve once their leader was out of commission. Apparently not. Even though it was most definitely not in his nature, Mulch had no option but to attack.\\n\\n \\n\\n He unhinged his jaw and leaped forward, clamping his teeth around the foremost goblin\u0027s head.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Ow, bagg off!\u0027 he shouted around the obstruction in his mouth. \u0027Bagg off or ur briend gedds it!\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n The others froze, uncertain of their next move. Of course they\u0027d all seen what dwarf molars could do to a goblin head. Not a pretty sight.\\n\\n \\n\\n Each one popped a fireball in his fist.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m warnih ooh!\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You can\u0027t get us all, stumpy.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch resisted the impulse to bite down. It is the strongest of dwarf urges, a genetic memory born from millennia spent tunnelling. The fact that the goblin was wriggling slimily didn\u0027t help. His options were running out. The gang was advancing and he was powerless as long as his mouth was full. It was crunch time. Pardon the pun.\\n\\n \\n\\n Suddenly the cell door clanked open and what seemed like an entire squadron of LEP officers flooded the confined space. Mulch felt the cold steel of a gun barrel against his temple.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Spit out the prisoner,\u0027 ordered a voice.\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch was delighted to comply. A thoroughly slimed goblin collapsed retching on the floor.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You goblins, put \u0027em out.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n One by one the fireballs were extinguished.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s not my fault,\u0027 whined Mulch, pointing to the spasming wart-face. \u0027He blew himself up.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n The officer holstered his weapon, drawing out a set of cuffs.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I couldn\u0027t care less what you do to each other,\u0027 he said, spinning Mulch and snapping the cuffs on. \u0027If it was up to me, I\u0027d put the whole lot of you in a big room, and come back a week later to sluice it out. But Commander Root wants to see you above ground ASAP.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027ASAP?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Now, if not sooner.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch knew Root. The commander was responsible for several of his government hotel visits. If Julius wanted to see him, it probably wasn\u0027t for drinks and a movie.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Now? But it\u0027s daylight now. I\u0027ll burn.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n The LEP officer laughed.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It ain\u0027t daylight where you\u0027re going, pal. Where you\u0027re going it ain\u0027t anything.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Root was waiting for the dwarf inside the time-field portal. The portal was yet another of Foaly\u0027s inventions. Fairies could be introduced to and leave the time-field without affecting the altered flow inside the field. This effectively meant that even though it took nearly six hours to get Mulch to the surface, he was injected into the field only moments after Root had the notion to send for him.\\n\\n \\n\\n It was Mulch\u0027s first time in a field. He stood watching life proceed at an exaggerated rate outside the shimmering corona. Cars zipped by at impossible speeds, and clouds tumbled across the skyline as though driven by force-ten gales.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Mulch, you little reprobate,\u0027 roared Root. \u0027You can take off that suit now. The field is UV-filtered, or so I\u0027m told.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n The dwarf had been issued a blackout suit at E1. Even though dwarfs had thick skins, they were extremely sensitive to sunlight and had a burn time of less than three minutes. Mulch peeled off the skintight suit.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Nice to see you, Julius.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s Commander Root to you.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Commander now. I heard that. Clerical error, was it?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Root\u0027s teeth ground his cigar to a pulp.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t have time for this impudence, convict. And the only reason that my boot is not up your behind right now is that I have a job for you.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch frowned. \u0027Convict? I have a name, you know, Julius.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Root squatted to the dwarf\u0027s level. \u0027I don\u0027t know what dreamworld you live in, convict, but in the real world you are a criminal and it is my job to ensure your life is as unpleasant as possible. So if you\u0027re expecting civility just because I\u0027ve testified against you some fifteen times, forget it!\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch rubbed his wrists where the handcuffs had left red welts.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Fine, Commander. No need to blow a gasket. I\u0027m not a murderer, you know, just a petty criminal.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027From what I hear, you nearly made the transformation below in the cells.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not my fault. They attacked me.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Root screwed a fresh cigar into his mouth.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Fine, whatever. Just follow me, and don\u0027t steal anything.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yessir, Commander,\u0027 said Mulch innocently. He didn\u0027t need to steal anything else. He\u0027d already palmed Root\u0027s field-access card when the commander had made the mistake of leaning over.\\n\\n \\n\\n They crossed the Retrieval perimeter to the avenue.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Do you see that manor?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What manor?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Root rounded on him. \u0027I don\u0027t have time for this, convict. Nearly half my time-stop has elapsed. Another few hours and one of my best officers will be blue-rinsed!\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch shrugged. \u0027None of my concern. I\u0027m just a criminal, remember. And by the way, I know what you want me to do, and the answer is no.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I haven\u0027t even asked you yet.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s obvious. I\u0027m a housebreaker. That\u0027s a house. You can\u0027t go in because you\u0027ll lose your magic, but my magic is already gone. Two and two.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Root spat out the cigar. \u0027Don\u0027t you have any civic pride? Our entire way of life is on the line here.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not my way of life. Fairy prison, human prison. It\u0027s all the same to me.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n The commander thought about it.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027OK, you slime. Fifty years off your sentence.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I want amnesty.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027In your dreams, Mulch.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Take it or leave it.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Seventy-five years in minimum security. You take it or leave it.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch pretended to think. It was all academic, seeing as he intended escaping anyway.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Single cell?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, yes. Single cell. Now, will you do it?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Very well, Julius. Only because it\u0027s you.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Foaly was searching for a matching iris-cam.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Hazel, I think. Or perhaps tawny. You really do have stunning eyes, Mister Mulch.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Thank you, Foaly. My mother always said they were my most attractive feature.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Root was pacing the shuttle floor.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You two do realize we\u0027re on a deadline here, don\u0027t you? Never mind matching the colour. Just give him a camera.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Foaly plucked a lens from its solution with tweezers.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027This is not just vanity, Commander. The closer the match, the less interference from the actual eye.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Whatever, whatever, just get on with it.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Foaly grabbed Mulch\u0027s chin, holding him still.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027There you are. We\u0027re with you all the way.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Foaly twisted a tiny cylinder into the thick tufts of hair growing from Mulch\u0027s ear.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Wired for sound now too. In case you need to call for assistance.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n The dwarf smiled wryly. \u0027Forgive me for not swelling with confidence. I find I\u0027ve always done better on my own.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027If you can call seventeen convictions doing better,\u0027 chuckled Root.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh, we have time for jokes now, do we?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Root grabbed him by the shoulder. \u0027You\u0027re right. We don\u0027t. Let\u0027s go.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n He dragged Mulch across a grassy verge to a cluster of cherry trees.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I want you to tunnel in there and find out how this Fowl person knows so much about us. Probably some surveillance device. Whatever it is, destroy it. Find Captain Short if possible and see what you can do for her. If she is dead, at least it will clear the way for a bio-bomb.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch squinted across the landscape. \u0027I don\u0027t like it.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What don\u0027t you like?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The lie of the land. I smell limestone. Solid-rock foundation. There might not be a way in.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Foaly trotted across. \u0027I\u0027ve done a scan. The original structure is based totally on rock, but some of the later extensions stray on to clay. The wine cellar in the south wing appears to have a wooden floor. It should be no problem for someone with a mouth like yours.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch decided to take that as a statement of fact rather than an insult. He opened the bum-flap on his tunnelling trousers. \u0027Right. Stand back.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Root and the surrounding LEP officers rushed for cover, but Foaly, who had never actually seen a dwarf tunnelling, decided to stay for a peek.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Good luck, Mulch.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n The dwarf unhinged his jaw.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Ank oo,\u0027 he mumbled, bending over for launch.\\n\\n \\n\\n The centaur looked around.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Where\u0027s everyone -\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n He never finished that statement, because a blob of recently swallowed and even more recently recycled clay whacked him in the face. By the time he\u0027d cleared his eyes, Mulch had disappeared down a vibrating hole, and there was the sound of hearty laughter shaking the cherry trees.\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch followed a loamy vein through a volcanic fold in the rock. Nice consistency, not too many loose stones. Plenty of insect life too. Vital for strong healthy teeth, a dwarf\u0027s most important attribute - the first thing a prospective mate looked at. Mulch went low to the limestone, his belly almost scraping the rock. The deeper the tunnel, the less chance of subsidence on the surface. You couldn\u0027t be too careful these days, not with motion sensors and landmines. Mud People went to extraordinary lengths to protect their valuables. With good reason, as it happened.\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch felt a vibration cluster to his left. Rabbits. The dwarf fixed the location in his internal compass. Always useful to know where the local wildlife hung out. He skirted the warren, following the manor foundations around in a long north-westerly loop.\\n\\n \\n\\n Wine cellars were easy to locate. Over the centuries, residue seeped through the floor, infusing the land beneath with the wine\u0027s personality. This one was sombre, nothing cheeky here. A touch of fruit, but not enough to lighten the flavour. Definitely an occasion wine on the bottom rack. Mulch burped. That was good clay.\\n\\n \\n\\n The dwarf aimed his scything jaws skywards, punching through the floorboards. He hauled himself through the jagged hole, shaking the last of the recycled mud from his trousers.\\n\\n \\n\\n He was in a blessedly dark room, perfect for dwarf vision. His sonar had guided him to an uncovered spot in the floor. One metre to the left and he would have emerged in a huge barrel of Italian red.\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch rehinged his jaw and padded across to the wall. He flattened a conch-like ear to the red brickwork. For a moment he was absolutely still, absorbing the house\u0027s vibrations. A lot of low-frequency humming. There was a generator somewhere, and plenty of juice running through the wires.\\n\\n \\n\\n Footsteps too. Way up. Maybe on the third floor. And close by. A crashing sound. Metal on concrete. There it was again. Someone was building something. Or breaking something down.\\n\\n \\n\\n Something skittered past his foot. Mulch squashed it instinctively. It was a spider. Just a spider.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Sorry, little friend,\u0027 he said to the grey smear. \u0027I\u0027m a bit on the jittery side.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n The steps were wooden, of course. More than a century old too by the smell of them. Steps like that creaked as soon as you looked at them. Better than any pressure pads for giving away intruders. Mulch climbed along the edges, one foot in front of the other. Right in by the wall was where the wood had most support and was less likely to creak.\\n\\n \\n\\n This was not as simple as it sounds. Dwarf feet are designed for spadework, not for the delicate intricacies of ballet dancing or balancing on wooden steps. Nonetheless, Mulch reached the door without incident. A couple of minor squeaks, but nothing that would be detectable by human ears or hardware.\\n\\n \\n\\n The door was locked, naturally, but it may as well not have been for all the challenge it presented to a kleptomaniac dwarf.\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch reached into his beard, plucking out a sturdy hair. Dwarf hair is radically different from the human variety. Mulch\u0027s beard and head hair were actually a matrix of antennae that helped him to navigate and avoid danger below ground. Once removed from its pore, the hair immediately stiffened in rapid rigor mortis. Mulch twisted the end in the seconds before it became completely rigid. A perfect pick.\\n\\n \\n\\n One quick jiggle and the lock yielded. Only two tumblers. Terrible security. Typical of humans, they never expected an attack from below. Mulch stepped on to a parquet corridor. The whole place smelled of money. He could make a fortune here, if only he had the time.\\n\\n \\n\\n There were cameras just below the architrave. Tastefully done, nestling in the natural shadows. But vigilant none the less. Mulch stood for a moment, calculating the system\u0027s blindspot. Three cameras on the corridor. Ninety-second sweep. No way through.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You could ask for help?\u0027 said a voice in his ear.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Foaly?\u0027 Mulch pointed his wired eyeball at the nearest camera. \u0027Can you do anything about those?\u0027 he whispered.\\n\\n \\n\\n The dwarf heard the sound of a keyboard being manipulated, and suddenly his right eye zoomed like a camera lens.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Handy,\u0027 breathed Mulch. \u0027I\u0027ve got to get me one of these.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Root\u0027s voice crackled through the tiny speaker. \u0027No chance, convict. Government issue. Anyway, what would you do with one in prison? Get a close-up of the other side of your cell?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re such a charmer, Julius. What\u0027s the matter? Are you jealous because I\u0027m succeeding where you failed?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Root\u0027s foul swearing was drowned out by Foaly.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027OK, I\u0027ve got it. Simple video network. Not even digital. I\u0027m going to broadcast a loop of the last ten seconds to every camera through our dishes. That should give you a few minutes.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch shuffled uncomfortably. \u0027How long will that take? I\u0027m a bit exposed here, you know.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s already started,\u0027 replied Foaly. \u0027So get moving.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Are you sure?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Of course I\u0027m sure. Elementary electronics. I\u0027ve been messing with human surveillance since kindergarten. You\u0027ll just have to trust me.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n I\u0027d rather trust a bunch of humans not to hunt a species to extinction than trust an LEP consultant, thought Mulch. But aloud he said, \u0027OK. I\u0027m away. Over and out.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n He sneaked down the hall. Even his hands were sneaky, padding the air as if he could somehow make himself lighter. Whatever that centaur did must have worked, because there were no agitated Mud People racing down the stairs, waving primitive gunpowder weapons.\\n\\n \\n\\n Stairs. Ah, stairs. Mulch had a thing for stairs. They were like predug shafts. He found that inevitably the best booty lay at their summit. And what a stairway. Stained oak, with the intricate carvings generally associated with either the eighteenth century or the obscenely rich. Mulch rubbed his finger along an ornate banister. In this case, probably both.\\n\\n \\n\\n Still, no time to moon about. Stairways did not tend to remain deserted for long, especially during a siege. Who could tell how many bloodthirsty troopers waited behind each door, eager for a fairy head to add to their stuffed trophy wall.\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch climbed carefully, taking nothing for granted. Even solid oak creaked. He stuck to the borders, avoiding the carpet inlay. The dwarf knew from conviction number eight how easy it was to conceal a pressure pad beneath the deep shag of some antique weave.\\n\\n \\n\\n He reached the landing with his head still attached to his shoulders. But there was another problem quite literally brewing. Dwarf digestion, due to its accelerated rate, can be quite explosive. The loosely packed soil on the Fowl estate was very well aerated and a lot of that air had entered Mulch\u0027s tubes along with the soil and minerals. Now the air wanted to get out.\\n\\n \\n\\n Dwarf etiquette dictated that gas be passed while still in the tunnel, but Mulch didn\u0027t have time for manners. Now he regretted not taking a moment to get rid of the gas while he was in the cellar. The problem with dwarf gas was that it couldn\u0027t go up, only down. Imagine, if you will, the catastrophic effects of burping while digesting a mouthful of clay. Total system back-up. Not a pretty sight. Thus dwarf anatomy ensured that all gas was passed below, actually aiding in the expulsion of unwanted clay. Of course, there\u0027s a simpler way of putting this, but that version can only be read in the adult book.\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch wrapped his arms around his stomach. He\u0027d better get out of the open. A blowout on a landing like this could take out the windows. He shuffled along the corridor, skipping through the first doorway he encountered.\\n\\n \\n\\n More cameras. Quite a lot of them, in fact. Mulch studied the lenses\u0027 sweep. Four were surveying the general floorspace, but another three were fixed.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Foaly? You there?\u0027 whispered the dwarf.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No!\u0027 The typical sarcastic reply. \u0027I have much better things to do than worry about the collapse of civilization as we know it.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, thank you. Don\u0027t let my life being in danger interrupt your merriment.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll try not to.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I have a challenge for you.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Foaly was instantly interested. \u0027Really? Go on.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch pointed his gaze at the recessed cameras, half hidden in the swirling architrave. \u0027I need to know where those three cameras are pointing. Exactly.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Foaly laughed. \u0027That\u0027s not a challenge. Those old video systems emit faint ion beams. Invisible to the naked eye, of course, but not with your iris-cam.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n The hardware in Mulch\u0027s eye flickered and sparked.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oww!\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Sorry. Small charge.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You could have warned me.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll give you a big kiss later, you baby. I thought dwarfs were tough.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027We are tough. I\u0027ll show you just how tough when I get back.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Root\u0027s voice interrupted the posturing. \u0027You won\u0027t be showing anyone anything, convict, except perhaps where the toilet is in your cell. Now, what do you see?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch looked at the room again through his ion-sensitive eye. Each camera was emitting a faint beam, like the last evening sunrays. The rays pooled on a portrait of Artemis Fowl Senior.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not behind the picture. Oh, please.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch placed his ear against the picture glass. Nothing electrical. Not alarmed then. Just to be sure, he sniffed the frame\u0027s edge. No plastic or copper. Wood, steel and glass. Some lead in the paint. He curled a nail behind the frame and pulled. The picture came away smoothly, hinged on the side. And behind it. A safe.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a safe,\u0027 said Foaly.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I know that, you idiot. I\u0027m trying to concentrate here! If you want to help, tell me the combination.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No problem. Oh, by the way, there\u0027s another little shock coming. Maybe the big baby would like to suck his thumb for comfort.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Foaly. I\u0027m going to ... Owww!\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027There. That\u0027s the X-ray on.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch squinted at the safe. It was incredible. He could see right into the works. Tumblers and catches stood out in shadowy relief. He blew on his hairy fingers and twisted the combination dial. In seconds the safe lay open before him.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh,\u0027 he said, disappointed.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What is it?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Nothing. Just human currency. Nothing of value.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Leave it,\u0027 ordered Root. \u0027Try another room. Get going.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch nodded. Another room. Before his time ran out. But something was niggling at him. If this guy was so clever, why did he put the safe behind a painting? Such a cliché. Totally against form. No. Something wasn\u0027t right here. They were being duped somehow.\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch closed the safe, swinging the portrait back into position. It swung smoothly, weightless on the hinges. Weightless. He swung the picture out again. And back in.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Convict. What are you doing?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Shut up, Julius! I mean, quiet a moment, Commander.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch squinted at the frame\u0027s profile. A bit thicker than normal. Quite a bit thicker. Even taking the box frame into account. Five centimetres. He ran a nail down the heavy cartridge backing and stripped it away to reveal ...\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Another safe.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n A smaller one. Custom-made, obviously.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Foaly. I can\u0027t see through this.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Lead-lined. You\u0027re on your own, burglar boy. Do what you do best.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Typical,\u0027 muttered Mulch, flattening his ear to the cold steel.\\n\\n \\n\\n He twirled the dial experimentally. Nice action. The clicks were muted by the lead, he would have to concentrate. The upside was that something this thin could have only three tumblers at the most.\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch held his breath and twisted the dial, one cog at a time. To the normal ear, even with amplification, the clicks would have seemed uniform. But to Mulch, each cog had a distinctive signature and when a ratchet caught, it was so loud as to be deafening.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027One,\u0027 he breathed.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Hurry it up, convict. Your time is running out.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You interrupted to tell me that? I can see now how you made commander, Julius.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Convict. I\u0027m going to ... \u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n But it was no use. Mulch had removed his earpiece, slipping it into his pocket. Now he could devote his full attention to the task at hand.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Two.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n There was noise outside. In the hall. Someone was coming. About the size of an elephant by the size of it. No doubt this was the man mountain that had made mincemeat of the Retrieval Squad.\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch blinked a bead of sweat from his eye. Concentrate. Concentrate. The cogs clicked by. Millimetre by millimetre. Nothing was catching. The floor seemed to be hopping gently, though he could be imagining it.\\n\\n \\n\\n Click, click. Come on. Come on. His fingers were slick with perspiration, the dial slipping between them. Mulch wiped them on his jerkin. \u0027Now, baby, come on. Talk to me.\u0027 Click. Thunk. \u0027Yes!\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch twisted the handle. Nothing. Still an obstruction. He ran a fingertip over the metal face. There. A small irregularity. A micro keyhole. Too small for your average lock pick. Time for a little trick he\u0027d learned in prison. Quickly though, his stomach was bubbling like stew in the oven, and the footsteps were getting closer.\\n\\n \\n\\n Selecting a sturdy chin hair, Mulch fed it gently into the tiny hole. When the tip reappeared, he pulled the root from his chin. The hair immediately stiffened, retaining the shape of the lock\u0027s interior.\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch held his breath and twisted. Smooth as a goblin\u0027s lie, the lock opened. Beautiful. At moments like these, it was almost worth all the jail time.\\n\\n \\n\\n The kleptomaniac dwarf swung back the little door. Beautiful work. Almost worthy of a fairy forge. Light as a wafer. Inside was a small chamber. And in the chamber was ...\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh, gods above,\u0027 breathed Mulch.\\n\\n \\n\\n Then things came to a head rather rapidly. The shock that Mulch had experienced communicated itself to his bowels, and they decided the excess air had got to go. Mulch knew the symptoms. Jelly legs, bubbling cramps, wobbly behind. In the seconds remaining to him, he snatched the object from the safe and, leaning over, he clasped his knees for support.\\n\\n \\n\\n The constrained wind had built itself up to mini-cyclone intensity and could not be constrained. And so it exited. Rather abrasively. Blowing open Mulch\u0027s bum-flap and slamming into the rather large gentleman who had been sneaking up behind him.\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis was glued to the monitors. This was the time when things traditionally went wrong for kidnappers - the third quarter of operations. Having been successful thus far, the abductors tended to relax, light up a few cigarettes, get chatty with their hostages. Next thing they knew, they were flat on their faces with a dozen guns pointed at the backs of their heads. Not Artemis Fowl. He didn\u0027t make mistakes.\\n\\n \\n\\n No doubt the fairies were reviewing the tapes of their first negotiating session, searching for anything that would give them a way in. Well, it was there all right. All they had to do was look. Buried just deep enough to make it look accidental.\\n\\n \\n\\n It was possible that Commander Root would try another ruse. He was a wily one, no doubt about it. One who would not take kindly to being bested by a child. He would bear watching.\\n\\n \\n\\n The mere thought of Root gave Artemis the shivers. He decided to check in again. He inspected the monitors.\\n\\n \\n\\n Juliet was still in the kitchen, scrubbing at the sink. Washing the vegetables.\\n\\n \\n\\n Captain Short was on her bunk. Quiet as the grave. No more bed banging. Perhaps he had been wrong about her. Perhaps there was no plan.\\n\\n \\n\\n Butler stood at his post outside Holly\u0027s cell. Odd. He should have been on his rounds by now. Artemis grabbed a walkie-talkie.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Butler?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Roger, base. Receiving.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Shouldn\u0027t you be on your rounds?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n There was a pause. \u0027I am, Artemis. Patrolling the main landing. Coming up on the safe room. I\u0027m waving at you right now.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis glanced at the landing cameras. Deserted. From every angle. Definitely no waving manservant. He studied the monitors, counting under his breath .. .There! Every ten seconds, a slight jump. On every screen.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027A loop!\u0027 he cried, jumping from his chair. \u0027They\u0027re feeding us a loop!\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Over the speaker, he could hear Butler\u0027s pace quickening to a run.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The safe room!\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis\u0027s stomach dropped into queasy hell. Duped! He, Artemis Fowl, had been duped, even though he\u0027d known it was coming. Inconceivable. It was arrogance that had done it. His own blinding arrogance, and now the entire plan could collapse around his ears.\\n\\n \\n\\n He switched the walkie-talkie to Juliet\u0027s band. It was a pity now that he\u0027d taken the house\u0027s intercom off-line, but it didn\u0027t operate on a secure frequency.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Juliet?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Receiving.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Where are you right now?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027In the kitchen. Wrecking my nails on this grater.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Leave it, Juliet. Check on the prisoner.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But, Artemis, the carrot sticks will dry out!\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Leave it, Juliet!\u0027 shouted Artemis. \u0027Drop everything and check on the prisoner!\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Juliet obediently dropped everything, including the walkie-talkie. She\u0027d sulk for days now. Never mind. There was no time to worry about a teenage girl\u0027s bruised ego. He had more important matters to tend to.\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis depressed the master switch on the computerized surveillance system. His only chance of purging the loop was a complete reboot. After several agonizing moments of screen snow, the monitors jumped and settled. Things were not as they had seemed only seconds before.\\n\\n \\n\\n There was a grotesque thing in the safe room. It had apparently discovered the secret compartment. Not only that but it had managed to open the whisper lock. Amazing. Butler had it covered though. He was sneaking up behind the creature, and any moment now the intruder would find itself nose down in the carpet.\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis switched his attention to Holly. The elf was back to bed banging. Slamming the frame down over and over again, as though she could ...\\n\\n \\n\\n It hit Artemis then, like a blast from a water cannon. If Holly had somehow smuggled an acorn in here, then one square centimetre of ground would be enough. If Juliet left that door open ...\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Juliet!\u0027 he shouted into the walkie-talkie. \u0027Juliet! Don\u0027t go in there!\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n But it was useless. The girl\u0027s walkie-talkie lay buzzing on the kitchen floor, and Artemis could only watch helplessly as Butler\u0027s sister strode towards the cell door, muttering about carrots.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The safe room!\u0027 exclaimed Butler, quickening his pace. His instinct was to go in all guns blazing, but training took over. Fairy hardware was most definitely superior to his own, and who knew how many barrels were aimed at the other side of that door right now. No, caution was most definitely the best part of valour in this particular situation.\\n\\n \\n\\n He placed a palm against the wood, feeling for vibration. Nothing. No machinery then. Butler curled his fingers around the knob, twisting gently. With his other hand, he drew a Sig Sauer automatic from his shoulder holster. No time to fetch the dart rifle, it would have to be shoot to kill.\\n\\n \\n\\n The door swung open noiselessly, as Butler knew it would, having oiled every hinge in the house himself. Before him was ... Well, to be honest, Butler wasn\u0027t quite sure what it was. If he didn\u0027t know better, that is at first glance, he could have sworn that the thing resembled nothing more than an enormous quivering ...\\n\\n \\n\\n And then the thing exploded, jettisoning an amazing amount of tunnel waste directly at the unfortunate manservant! It was like being battered with a hundred sledgehammers simultaneously. Butler was lifted bodily and flung against the wall.\\n\\n \\n\\n And as he lay there, consciousness slipping away from him, he prayed that Master Artemis hadn\u0027t managed to capture the moment on video.\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly was weakening. The bedframe was nearly twice her body weight and the ridges were tearing cruel welts in her palms. But she couldn\u0027t stop now. Not when she was so close.\\n\\n \\n\\n She slammed the post into the concrete again. A cloud of grey dust spiralled around her legs. Any second now, Fowl would tumble to her plan and she\u0027d get the hypodermic treatment again. But until then ...\\n\\n \\n\\n She gritted her teeth against the pain, heaving the bedframe to knee height. Then she saw it. A sliver of brown among the grey. Could it be true?\\n\\n \\n\\n Pain forgotten, Captain Short dropped the bed, sinking quickly to her knees. There was indeed a small patch of earth poking through the cement. Holly fumbled the acorn from her boot, clasping it tightly in bloody fingers.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I return you to the earth,\u0027 she whispered, worming her fist into the tiny space. \u0027And claim the gift that is my right.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Nothing happened for a heartbeat. Perhaps two. Then Holly felt the magic rush up her arm like a jolt from an electrified troll fence. The shock sent her spinning across the room. For a moment the world swirled in a disconcerting kaleidoscope of colour, but when it settled Holly was no longer the defeated elf she had been.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Right, Master Fowl.\u0027 She grinned, watching the blue sparks of fairy magic seal her wounds. \u0027Let\u0027s see what I have to do to get your permission to leave this place.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Drop everything,\u0027 sulked Juliet. \u0027Drop everything and check the prisoner.\u0027 She flicked blonde tresses expertly over a shoulder. \u0027He must think I\u0027m his maid or something.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n She hammered on the cell door with the flat of her hand.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m coming in now, fairy girl, so if you\u0027re doing anything embarrassing, please stop.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Juliet punched the combination into the keypad. \u0027And no, I don\u0027t have your vegetables, or your washed fruit. But it\u0027s not my fault, Artemis in-sis-ted I come right down ...\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Juliet stopped talking, because there was nobody listening. She was preaching to an empty room. She waited for her brain to pass on an explanation. Nothing came. Eventually the notion to take another look filtered down.\\n\\n \\n\\n She took a tentative step into the concrete cube. Nothing. Only a slight shimmering in the shadows. Like a mist. It was probably these stupid glasses. How were you supposed to see anything wearing mirrored sunglasses underground? And they were so nineties, they weren\u0027t even retro yet.\\n\\n \\n\\n Juliet glanced guiltily at the monitor. Just a quick peek, what harm could it do? She whipped up the frames, sending her eyeballs spinning around the room.\\n\\n \\n\\n In that instant a figure materialized before her. Just stepped out of the air. It was Holly. She was smiling.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh, it\u0027s you. How did you -\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n The fairy interrupted with a wave of her hand.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Why don\u0027t you take off those glasses, Juliet? They really don\u0027t suit you.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n She\u0027s right, thought Juliet. And what a lovely voice. Like a choir all on its own. How could you argue with a voice like that?\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Sure. Caveman glasses off. Cool voice, by the way. Doh ray me and all that.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly decided not to try deciphering Juliet\u0027s comments. It was hard enough when the girl was in full control of her brain.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Now. A simple question.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No problem.\u0027 What a great idea.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027How many people in the house?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Juliet thought. One and one and one.\\n\\n \\n\\n And another one? No, Mrs Fowl wasn\u0027t there.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Three,\u0027 she said finally. \u0027Me and Butler and, of course, Artemis. Mrs Fowl was here, but she went bye-bye, then she went bye-bye.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Juliet giggled. She\u0027d made a joke. A good one too.\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly drew a breath to ask for clarification, then thought better of it. A mistake as it turned out.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Has anyone else been here. Anyone like me?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Juliet chewed her lip. \u0027There was one little man. In a uniform like yours. Not cute though. Not one bit. Just shouted and smoked a smelly cigar. Terrible complexion. Red as a tomato.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly almost smiled. Root had come himself. No doubt the negotiations had been disastrous.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No one else?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not that I know of. If you see that man again, tell him to lay off the red meat. He\u0027s just a coronary waiting to happen.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly swallowed a grin. Juliet was the only human she knew who was probably more lucid under the mesmer.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027OK. I\u0027ll tell him. Now, Juliet, I want you to stay in my room, and no matter what you hear, don\u0027t come out.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Juliet frowned. \u0027This room? It\u0027s so boring. No TV or anything. Can\u0027t I go up to the lounge?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No. You have to stay here. Anyway, they\u0027ve just installed a wall television. Cinema size. Wrestling, twenty-four hours a day.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Juliet almost fainted with pleasure. She ran into the cell, gasping as her imagination supplied the pictures.\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly shook her head. Well, she thought, at least one of us is happy.\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch gave his rear end a shake to dislodge any clumps of earth. If only his mother could see him now, spraying mud on the Mud People. That was irony, or something like it. Mulch had never been big on grammar in school. That or poetry. He\u0027d never seen the point. Down the mines, there were only two phrases of any importance: \u0027Look, gold!\u0027 and \u0027Cave in, everybody out!\u0027 No hidden meanings there, or rhymes.\\n\\n \\n\\n The dwarf buttoned his bum-flap, which had been blasted open by the gale emanating from his nether regions. Time to make a run for it. Whatever hope he\u0027d had of escaping undiscovered had been blown. Literally.\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch retrieved his earpiece, screwing it firmly into his ear. Well, you never knew, even the LEP might prove useful.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027... And when I get my hands on you, convict, you\u0027ll wish you stayed down those mines ...\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch sighed. Ah well. Nothing new there then.\\n\\n \\n\\n Clasping the safe\u0027s treasure tightly in his fist, the dwarf turned to retrace his steps. To his utter amazement there was a human entangled in the banisters. Mulch was not one bit surprised that his recyclings had managed to hurl the elephantine Mud Man several metres through the air. Dwarf gas had been known to cause avalanches in the Alps. What did surprise him was the fact that the man had managed to get so close to him in the first place.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re good,\u0027 said Mulch, wagging a finger at the unconscious bodyguard. \u0027But nobody takes a body blow from Mulch Diggums and stays on their feet.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n The Mud Man stirred, the whites of his eyes showing beneath fluttering lids.\\n\\n \\n\\n Root\u0027s voice crackled in the dwarf\u0027s ears. \u0027Get a move on, Mulch Diggums, before that Mud Man gets up and rearranges your innards. He took out an entire Retrieval team, you know.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch swallowed, his bravado suddenly deserting him.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027An entire Retrieval team? Maybe I should get back underground ... for the good of the mission.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Skipping hurriedly around the groaning bodyguard, Mulch took the steps two at a time. No point in worrying about creaking stairs when you\u0027ve just sent the intestinal equivalent of Hurricane Hal scurrying around the corridors.\\n\\n \\n\\n He\u0027d almost reached the cellar door when a figure shimmered into focus before him. Mulch recognized it as his arresting officer from the Renaissance Masters smuggling case.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Captain Short.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Mulch. I wasn\u0027t expecting to see you.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n The dwarf shrugged. \u0027Julius had a dirty job. Someone had to do it.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I get it,\u0027 said Holly, nodding. \u0027You\u0027ve already lost your magic. Smart. What did you find out?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch showed Holly his find. \u0027This was in his safe.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027A copy of the Book!\u0027 gasped Holly. \u0027No wonder we\u0027re in this fix. We were playing into his hands all along.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch opened the cellar door. \u0027Shall we?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t. I\u0027m under eyeball orders not to leave the house.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You magical types and your rituals. You have no idea how liberating it is to be rid of all that mumbo-jumbo.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n A series of sharp noises drifted down from the upper landing. It sounded like a troll thrashing around in a crystal emporium.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027We can debate ethics at a later date. Right now I suggest we make ourselves scarce.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch nodded. \u0027Agreed. This guy took out an entire Retrieval squad apparently.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly paused, half shielded.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027An entire squad? Hmm. Fully equipped. I wonder ...\"\\n\\n \\n\\n She continued her fade-out, and the last thing to go was her widening grin.\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch was tempted to hang around. There weren\u0027t many things more fun to watch than a heavily armed Recon officer going to town on a bunch of unsuspecting humans. By the time Captain Short got through with this Fowl character, he\u0027d be begging her to get out of his manor.\\n\\n \\n\\n The Fowl character in question was watching it all from the surveillance room. There was no denying it. Things were not good. Not good at all. But certainly not irredeemable. There was still hope.\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis catalogued the events of the last few minutes. The manor\u0027s security had been compromised. The safe room was in a shambles, blown apart by some sort of fairy flatulence. Butler lay unconscious, possibly paralysed by the same gaseous anomaly. His hostage was loose in the house, her fairy powers restored to her. There was an unsightly creature in leather chaps burrowing holes beneath the foundations, with no apparent regard for the fairy commandments. And the People had retrieved a copy of the Book, one of several copies as it happened, including one on disk in a Swiss vault.\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis\u0027s finger combed an errant strand of dark hair. He would have to dig very deep to uncover the good in this particular scenario. He took several deep breaths, finding his chi as Butler had taught him.\\n\\n \\n\\n After several moments\u0027 contemplation, he realized that these factors meant little to the overall strategies of both sides. Captain Short was still trapped in the manor. And the time-stoppage period was running out. Soon the LEP would have no option but to launch their bio-bomb, and that was when Artemis Fowl would unveil his coup de grace. Of course, the whole thing depended on Commander Root. If Root was as intellectually challenged as he looked, it was quite possible the entire scheme would collapse around his ears. Artemis hoped fervently that someone on the fairy team had the wit to spot the \u0027blunder\u0027 he\u0027d made during the negotiation session.\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch unbuttoned his bum-flap. Time to suck some dirt, as they said down the mines. The trouble with dwarf tunnels was that they were self-sealing, so that if you had to go back the way you came, there was a whole new burrow to be excavated. Some dwarfs retraced their steps exactly, chewing through the less compact and pre-digested dirt. Mulch preferred to dig a fresh tunnel. For some reason, eating the same dirt twice didn\u0027t appeal to him.\\n\\n \\n\\n Unhinging his jaw, the dwarf pointed himself torpedo-like through the hole in the floorboards. His heart calmed immediately as the scent of minerals filled his nostrils. Safe, he was safe. Nothing could catch a dwarf underground, not even a Skaylian rock worm. That was, of course, if he managed to get underground ...\\n\\n \\n\\n Ten very powerful fingers gripped Mulch by the ankles. This just wasn\u0027t the dwarf\u0027s day. First wart-face, now this homicidal human. Some people never learn. Usually Mud People.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Egg go,\u0027 he mumbled, unhinged jaw flapping uselessly.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not a chance,\u0027 came the reply. \u0027The only way you\u0027re leaving this house is in a body bag.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch could feel himself being dragged backwards. This human was strong. There weren\u0027t many creatures that could dislodge a dwarf with a grip on something. He scrabbled in the dirt, cramming handfuls of wine-impregnated clay into his cavernous mouth. There was only one chance.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Come on, you little goblin. Out of there.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Goblin! Mulch would have been indignant had he not been busy chewing clay to eject at his enemy.\\n\\n \\n\\n The human stopped talking. Possibly he had noticed the bum-flap, and probably the bum. No doubt what had happened in the safe room was coming back to him.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh...\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n What would have followed the \u0027Oh\u0027 is anyone\u0027s guess, but I\u0027d be willing to bet that it wouldn\u0027t have been \u0027dearie me\u0027. As it happened, Butler never had time to finish his expletive, because he wisely chose that moment to relinquish his grip. A wise choice indeed, because it coincided with the instant Mulch decided to launch his earthen offensive.\\n\\n \\n\\n A lump of compacted clay sped like a cannonball directly at the spot where Butler\u0027s head had been barely a second previously. Had it still occupied that space, the impact would have separated it from Butler\u0027s shoulders. An ignoble end for a bodyguard of his calibre. As it was, the soggy missile barely grazed his ear. Nevertheless, the force was sufficient to spin Butler like an ice skater, landing him on his rump for the second time in as many minutes.\\n\\n \\n\\n By the time his vision had settled, the dwarf had disappeared into a maelstrom of churning muck. Butler decided not to attempt pursuit. Dying below ground was not very high on his things to do list. But there will be another day, fairy, he thought grimly. And there was to be. But that\u0027s another story.\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch\u0027s momentum propelled him underground. He\u0027d gone several metres along the loamy vein before he realized no one was following. Once the taste of earth had settled his heart rate, he decided it was time to implement his escape plan.\\n\\n \\n\\n The dwarf altered his course, chewing his way towards the rabbit warren he\u0027d noted earlier. With any luck, the centaur hadn\u0027t run a seismology test on the manor grounds, or his ruse might be discovered. He\u0027d just have to bank on the fact that they had more important things to worry about than a missing prisoner. There shouldn\u0027t be any problem deceiving Julius, but the centaur, he was a smart one.\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch\u0027s internal compass steered him true, and within minutes he could feel the gentle vibrations of the rabbits loping along their tunnels. From here on timing was crucial if the illusion was to be effective. He slowed his digging rate, poking the soft clay gently until his fingers breached the tunnel wall. Mulch was careful to look the other way, because whatever he saw would be showing up on the viewscreen back in LEP HQ.\\n\\n \\n\\n Laying his fingers on the tunnel floor like an upturned spider, Mulch waited. It didn\u0027t take long. In seconds he felt the rhythmic thump of an approaching rabbit. The instant the animal\u0027s hind legs brushed the trap, he tightened his powerful digits around its neck. The poor animal never had a chance.\\n\\n \\n\\n Sorry, friend, thought the dwarf. If there was any other way ... Pulling the rabbit\u0027s body through the hole, Mulch rehinged his jaw and began screaming. \u0027Cave in! Cave in! Help! Help!\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Now for the tricky bit. With one hand he agitated the surrounding earth, bringing showers of it crumbling around his own head. With the other hand he popped the iris-cam out of his left eye and slid it into the rabbit\u0027s. Given the almost total darkness and the landfall confusion, it should be almost impossible to spot the switch.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Julius! Please. Help me.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Mulch! What\u0027s happening? What\u0027s your status?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n What\u0027s my status? thought the dwarf incredulously. Even in times of supposed crisis, the commander couldn\u0027t abandon his precious protocol.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I ... Argh ...\u0027 The dwarf dragged his final scream out, petering off to a gargling rattle.\\n\\n \\n\\n A bit melodramatic perhaps, but Mulch never could resist theatrics. With a last regretful glance at the dying animal, he unhinged his jaw and finned off to the south-east. Freedom beckoned.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/81/241.html","bookId":370,"book":{"id":370,"title":"Artemis Fowl精灵的赎金","description":"简介： 法尔家族是国际上赫赫有名的传奇世家，家族中的阿特米斯法尔更是一个人小鬼大的奇才。自从父亲和二十五万罐可乐一同消失在冰天雪地里之后，家族重担便落到小阿特米斯肩上。为了复兴家业，阿特米斯开始全世界搜寻传说中的小精灵，在获得了精灵世界的至宝《精灵之书》后，...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12890041089f0f8.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/81","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM"}}
