{"id":14704,"no":10,"title":"Chapter 9 Ace in the Hole","content":"ARTEMIS tried the doorknob and got a scorched palm for his trouble. Sealed. The fairy must have blasted it with her weapon. Very astute. One less variable in the equation. It was exactly what he himself would have done.\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis did not waste any time attempting to force open the door. It was reinforced steel and he was twelve. You didn\u0027t have to be a genius to figure it out, even though he was. Instead the Fowl heir apparent crossed to the monitor wall and followed developments from there.\\n\\n \\n\\n He knew immediately what the LEP were up to - send in the troll to secure a cry for help, interpret it as an invitation, and next thing you know a brigade of goblin stormtroopers were taking the manor. Clever. And unanticipated. It was the second time he\u0027d underestimated his opponents. One way or another, there wouldn\u0027t be a third.\\n\\n \\n\\n As the drama below unfolded on the monitors, Artemis\u0027s emotions jumped from terror to pride. Butler had done it. Defeated the troll, and without a single plea for aid passing his lips. Watching the display, Artemis appreciated fully, perhaps for the first time, the service provided by the Butler family.\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis activated the tri-band radio, broadcasting on revolving frequencies.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Commander Root, you are monitoring all channels I presume ...\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n For a few moments nothing but white noise emanated from the micro speakers, then Artemis heard the sharp click of a mike button.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I hear you, human. What can I do for you?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Is that the commander?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n A noise filtered through the black gauze. It sounded like a whinny.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No. This is not the commander. This is Foaly, the centaur. Is that the kidnapping lowlife human?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n It took Artemis a moment to process the fact that he\u0027d been insulted.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Mister ... ah ... Foaly. You have obviously not studied your psych texts. It is not wise to antagonize the hostage-taker. I may be unstable.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027May be unstable? There\u0027s no may about it. Not that it matters. Soon you\u0027ll be no more than a cloud of radioactive molecules.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis chuckled. \u0027That\u0027s where you are mistaken, my quadrupedal friend. By the time that bio-bomb is detonated, I will be long gone from this time-stop.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n It was Foaly\u0027s turn to chuckle. \u0027You\u0027re bluffing, human. If there was a way to escape the field, I would have found it. I think you\u0027re talking through your -\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Thankfully it was at that moment Root took over at the microphone.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Fowl? This is Commander Root. What do you want?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I would just like to inform you, Commander, that in spite of your attempted betrayal, I am still willing to negotiate.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027That troll had nothing to do with me,\u0027 protested Root. \u0027It was done against my wishes.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The fact is that it was done, and by the LEP. Whatever trust we had is gone. So here is my ultimatum. You have thirty minutes to send in the gold, or else I will refuse to release Captain Short. Furthermore, I will not take her with me when I leave the time-field, leaving her to be disintegrated by the bio-bomb.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t be a fool, human. You\u0027re deluding yourself. Mud technology is aeons behind ours. There is no way to escape the time-field.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis leaned in close to the mike, smiling his wolfish smile.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s only one way to find out, Root. Are you willing to bet Captain Short\u0027s life on your hunch?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Root\u0027s hesitation was highlighted by the hiss of interference. His reply, when it came, was tinged with just the right note of defeat.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 he sighed. \u0027I\u0027m not. You\u0027ll have your gold, Fowl. A tonne. Twenty-four carat.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis smirked. Quite the actor, our Commander Root.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Thirty minutes, Commander. Count the seconds if your clock\u0027s stopped. I\u0027m waiting. But not for long.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis terminated the contact, settling back in the swivel chair. It would seem as though the bait had been taken. No doubt the LEP analysts had discovered his \u0027accidental\u0027 invitation. The fairies would pay up because they believed the gold would be theirs again as soon as he was dead. Vaporized by the bio-bomb. Which, of course, he wouldn\u0027t be. In theory.\\n\\n \\n\\n Butler put three rounds into the door frame. The door itself was steel and would have sent the Devastator slugs ricocheting straight back at him. But the frame was the original porous stone used to build the manor. It crumbled like chalk. A very basic security flaw, and one that would have to be remedied once this business was over.\\n\\n \\n\\n Master Artemis was waiting calmly in his chair by the monitor bank.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Nice work, Butler.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Thank you, Artemis. We were in trouble for a moment there. If it hadn\u0027t been for the captain ...\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis nodded. \u0027Yes. I saw. Healing, one of the fairy arts. I wonder why she did it.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n T wonder too,\u0027 said Butler softly. \u0027We certainly didn\u0027t deserve it.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis glanced up sharply. \u0027Keep the faith, old friend. The end is in sight.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Butler nodded; he even attempted a smile. But though there were plenty of teeth in the grin, there was no heart.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027In less than an hour, Captain Short will be back with her people and we will have sufficient funds to relaunch some of our more tasteful enterprises.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I know. It\u0027s just ...\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis didn\u0027t have to ask. He knew exactly what Butler was feeling. The fairy had saved both their lives and yet he insisted on holding her to ransom. To a man of honour like Butler, this was almost more than he could bear.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The negotiations are over. One way or another she will be returned to her kind. No harm will befall Captain Short. You have my word.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027And Juliet?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Is there any danger to my sister?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No. No danger.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The fairies are just going to give us this gold and walk away?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis snorted gently. \u0027No, not exactly. They\u0027re going to bio-bomb Fowl Manor the second Captain Short is clear.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Butler took a breath to speak, but hesitated. Obviously there was more to the plan. Master Fowl would tell him when he needed to know. So instead of quizzing his employer, he made a simple statement.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I trust you, Artemis.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 replied the boy, the weight of that trust etched on his brow. \u0027I know.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Gudgeon was doing what politicians did best: trying to duck responsibility.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Your officer helped the humans,\u0027 he blurted, mustering as much indignation as possible. \u0027The entire operation was proceeding exactly as planned, until your female attacked our deputy.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Deputy?\u0027 chortled Foaly. \u0027Now the troll\u0027s a deputy.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes. He is. And that human made mincemeat of him. This entire situation could be wrapped up if it wasn\u0027t for your department\u0027s incompetence.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Ordinarily, Root would have blown his top at this point, but he knew that Gudgeon was grasping at straws, desperately trying to save his career. So the commander just smiled.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Hey, Foaly?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, Commander?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Did we get the troll assault on disk?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n The centaur heaved a dramatic sigh. \u0027No, sir, we ran out of disks just before the troll went in.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What a pity.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027A real shame.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Those disks could have been invaluable to Acting Commander Gudgeon at his hearing.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Gudgeon\u0027s cool went out the window. \u0027Give me those disks, Julius! I know they\u0027re in there! This is blatant obstruction.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re the only one guilty of obstruction around here, Gudgeon. Using this affair to further your own career.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Gudgeon\u0027s face took on a hue to match Root\u0027s own. The situation was slipping away from him and he knew it. Even Chix Verbil and the other sprites were sidling out from behind their leader.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I am still in charge here, Julius, so hand over those disks or I will have you detained.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh, really? You and whose army?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n For a second Gudgeon\u0027s face glowed with the old pomposity. It evaporated the moment he noticed the conspicuous lack of officers at his shoulders.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s right,\u0027 snickered Foaly. \u0027You ain\u0027t Acting Commander any more. The call came through from below. You\u0027ve got an appointment with the Council, and I don\u0027t think it\u0027s to offer you a seat.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n It was probably Foaly\u0027s grin that drove Gudgeon over the edge.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Give me those disks!\u0027 he roared, pinning Foaly to the operation\u0027s shuttle.\\n\\n \\n\\n Root was tempted to let them wrestle for a while, but now wasn\u0027t the time to indulge himself.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Naughty naughty,\u0027 he said, pointing his index finger at Gudgeon. \u0027No one beats Foaly but me.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Foaly paled. \u0027Careful with that finger. You\u0027re still wearing the -\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Root\u0027s thumb accidentally brushed his knuckle, opening a tiny gas valve. The released gas propelled a tranquillized dart through the latex fingertip and straight into Gudgeon\u0027s neck. The Acting Commander, soon to be Private, sank like a stone.\\n\\n \\n\\n Foaly rubbed his neck. \u0027Nice shot, Commander.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about. Total accident. I forgot all about the fake finger. There are several precedents, I believe.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh, absolutely. Unfortunately Gudgeon will be unconscious for several hours. By the time he awakens, all the excitement will be over.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Shame.\u0027 Root allowed himself a fleeting grin, then it was back to business. \u0027Is the gold here?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yep, they just inserted it.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Good.\u0027 He called to Gudgeon\u0027s sheepish troops. \u0027Get it loaded on a hover trolley and send it in. Any trouble and I\u0027ll feed you your wings. Understood?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n No one actually replied, but it was understood. No doubt about it.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Good. Now hop to it.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Root disappeared into the operation\u0027s shuttle, Foaly clopping behind him. The commander shut the door firmly.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Is it armed?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n The centaur flicked a few important-looking switches on the main console.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It is now.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I want it launched as soon as possible.\u0027 He glanced through the laser-proof refractor glass. \u0027We\u0027re down to minutes here. I see sunlight poking through.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Foaly bent to his keyboard in earnest. \u0027The magic is breaking up. In fifteen minutes we\u0027re going to be in the middle of overground daytime. The neutrino streams are losing their integrity.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I see,\u0027 said Root, which was basically a lie again. \u0027OK, I don\u0027t see. But I do get the fifteen minutes bit. That gives you ten minutes to get Captain Short out of there. After that we\u0027re going to be sitting ducks for the entire human race.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Foaly activated yet another camera. This one was linked to the hovertrolley. He ran a finger experimentally across a trackpad. The trolley shot forward, almost decapitating Chix Verbil.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Nice driving,\u0027 muttered Root. \u0027Will it get up the steps?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Foaly didn\u0027t even look up from his computers.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Automatic clearance compensator. One-point-five metre collar. No problems.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Root speared him with a glare. \u0027You do that just to annoy me, don\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Foaly shrugged his shoulders. \u0027I might do.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, well, count yourself lucky my other fingers aren\u0027t loaded. Get my meaning?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yessir.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Good. Now let\u0027s bring Captain Short home.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly hovered beneath the portico. Orange shards of light striped the blue. The time-stop was breaking up. There were only minutes left before Root blue-rinsed the whole place. Foaly\u0027s voice buzzed in her earpiece.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027OK, Captain Short. The gold is on the way. Be ready to move.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027We don\u0027t bargain with kidnappers,\u0027 said Holly, surprised. \u0027What\u0027s going on here?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Nothing,\u0027 replied Foaly casually. \u0027Straightforward exchange. The gold goes in, you come out. We send in the missile. Big blue bang, and it\u0027s all over.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Does Fowl know about the bio-bomb?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yep. Knows all about it. Claims he can escape the time-field.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s impossible.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Correct.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But they\u0027ll all be killed!\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Big deal,\u0027 retorted Foaly, and Holly could almost see him shrug. \u0027That\u0027s what you get when you mess with the People.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly was torn. There was no doubt that Fowl was a danger to the civilized underworld. Very few tears would be shed over his body. But the girl, Juliet, she was an innocent. She deserved a chance.\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly descended to an altitude of two metres. Head height for Butler. The humans had congregated in the wreckage that used to be a hallway. There was disunity between them. The LEP officer could sense it.\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly glared accusingly at Artemis. \u0027Have you told them?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis returned her stare. \u0027Told them what?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, Fairy, told us what?\u0027 echoed Juliet belligerently, still a bit miffed over the mesmerizing.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t play dumb, Fowl. You know what I\u0027m talking about.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis never could play dumb for very long. \u0027Yes, Captain Short. I do. The bio-bomb. Your concern would be touching, if it extended to myself. Nevertheless, do not upset yourself. Everything is proceeding according to plan.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027According to plan!\u0027 gasped Holly, pointing to the devastation surrounding them. \u0027Was this part of the plan? And Butler almost getting killed - all part of the plan?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 Artemis admitted. \u0027The troll was a slight blip. But irrelevant to the overall scheme.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly resisted the urge to punch the pale human again, turning instead to Butler.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Listen to reason, for heaven\u0027s sake. You cannot escape the time-field. It has never been done.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Butler\u0027s features could have been etched in stone.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027If Artemis says it can be done, then it can.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But your sister. Are you willing to risk her life out of loyalty to a felon?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Artemis is no felon, miss, he is a genius. Now please remove yourself from my sightline. I am monitoring the main entrance.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly buzzed up to six metres.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re crazy. All of you! In five minutes you\u0027ll all be dust. Don\u0027t you realize?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis sighed. \u0027You\u0027ve had your answer, Captain. Now, please. This is a delicate stage in the proceedings.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Proceedings? It\u0027s a kidnapping! At least have the guts to call it what it is.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis\u0027s patience was beginning to fray.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Butler, do we have any tranquillizer hypodermics left?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n The giant manservant nodded, but didn\u0027t speak. At that precise moment, if the order came to sedate, he wasn\u0027t sure if he would, or could. Luckily Artemis\u0027s attention was diverted by activity in the avenue.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Ah, it would seem the LEP have capitulated. Butler supervise the delivery. But stay alert. Our fairy friends are not above trickery.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re a fine one to talk,\u0027 muttered Holly.\\n\\n \\n\\n Butler hurried to the demolished doorway, checking the load and catch on his Sig Sauer nine-millimetre. He was almost grateful for some military activity to distract him from his dilemma. In situations like these, training took over. There was no room for sentiment.\\n\\n \\n\\n A fine haze of dust still hung in the air. Butler squinted through it, into the avenue beyond. The fairy filters rigged over his eyes revealed that there were no warm bodies approaching. There was, however, a large trolley seemingly driving itself up to the front door. It was floating on a cushion of shimmering air. Doubtless Master Artemis would have understood the physics of this machine, all Butler cared about was whether or not he could disable it.\\n\\n \\n\\n The trolley bumped into the first step.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Automatic compensator, my foot,\u0027 snorted Root.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yeah, yeah, yeah,\u0027 replied Foaly. \u0027I\u0027m working on it.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s the ransom,\u0027 shouted Butler.\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis tried to quell the excitement rising in his chest. This was not the time to allow emotions to enter the equation.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Check for booby traps.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Butler stepped cautiously on to the porch. Shards of disintegrated gargoyle lay scattered beneath his feet.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No hostiles. Seems to be self-propelled.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n The trolley lurched over the steps.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know who\u0027s driving this thing, but he could do with a few lessons.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Butler bent low to the ground, scanning the trolley\u0027s underside.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No explosive devices visible.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n He extracted a Sweeper from his pocket, extending the telescopic aerial.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No bugs either. Nothing detectable at any rate. But what do we have here?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Uh oh,\u0027 said Foaly.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a camera.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Butler reached in, pulling the fish-eye lens out by the cable.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Nighty-night, gentlemen.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n In spite of the load it carried, the trolley responded easily to Butler\u0027s touch, gliding across the threshold into the lobby. It stood there humming softly, as though waiting to be unloaded.\\n\\n \\n\\n Now that the moment had come, Artemis was almost afraid to seize it. It was hard to believe that after all these months, his wicked scheme was minutes away from fruition. Of course these last few minutes were the vital ones, and the most dangerous.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Open it,\u0027 he said at last, surprised at the tremble in his own voice.\\n\\n \\n\\n It was an irresistible instant. Juliet approached tentatively, spangled eyes wide. Even Holly closed the throttle a notch, dropping until her feet brushed the marble tiling. Butler unzipped the black tarpaulin, dragging it back across the cargo. Nobody said a thing. Artemis imagined that somewhere the 1812 Overture was playing. The gold sat there, stacked in shining rows. It seemed to have an aura, a warmth, but also an inherent danger. There were a lot of people willing to die or kill for the unimaginable wealth this gold could bring.\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly was mesmerized. Fairies have an affinity for minerals, they are of the earth. But gold was their favourite. Its lustre. Its allure.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027They paid,\u0027 she breathed. \u0027I can\u0027t believe it.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Neither can I,\u0027 murmured Artemis. \u0027Butler, is it real?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Butler hefted a bar from the stack. He dug the tip of a throwing knife into the ingot, gouging out a small sliver.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s real all right,\u0027 he said, holding the scraping up to the light. \u0027This one, at any rate.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Good. Very good. Begin unloading it, would you? We\u0027ll send the trolley back out with Captain Short.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Hearing her name dispelled Holly\u0027s gold fever.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Artemis, give it up. No human has ever succeeded in keeping fairy gold. And they\u0027ve been trying for centuries. The LEP will do anything to protect their property.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis shook his head. Amused.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve told you ...\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly took him by the shoulders. \u0027You cannot escape! Don\u0027t you understand?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n The boy returned her gaze coolly.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I can escape, Holly. Look in my eyes and tell me that I can\u0027t.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n So she did. Captain Holly Short gazed into her captor\u0027s blue-black eyes and she saw the truth in there. And for a moment she believed it.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s still time,\u0027 she said desperately. \u0027There must be something. I have magic.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n A crease of annoyance wrinkled the boy\u0027s brow.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I hate to disappoint you, Captain, but there is absolutely nothing.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis paused, his gaze tugged momentarily upstairs to the converted loft. Perhaps, he thought. Do I really need all this gold? And was his conscience not pricking him, leeching the sweetness from his victory? He shook himself. Stick to the plan. Stick to the plan. No emotion.\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis felt a familiar hand on his shoulder.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Everything all right?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, Butler. Keep unloading. Get Juliet to help. I need to talk to Captain Short.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Are you sure there\u0027s nothing wrong?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis sighed. \u0027No, old friend, I\u0027m not sure. But it\u0027s too late now.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Butler nodded, returning to his task. Juliet toddled along behind him like a terrier.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Now, Captain. About your magic.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What about it?\u0027 Holly\u0027s eyes were hooded with suspicion.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What would I have to do to buy a wish?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly glanced at the trolley. \u0027Well, that depends. What do you have to bargain with?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Root was not what you\u0027d call relaxed. Increasingly wide bands of yellow light were poking through the blue. Minutes left. Minutes. His migraine was not helped by the pungent cigar feeding toxins into his system.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Have all non-essential personnel been evacuated?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Unless they\u0027ve sneaked back in since the last time you asked me.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not now, Foaly. Believe me, now is not the time. Anything from Captain Short?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Nope. We lost video after the troll thing. I\u0027d guess the battery is ruptured. We\u0027d better get that helmet off her ASAP, or the radiation will fry her brain. That\u0027d be a pity after all this work.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Foaly returned to his console. A red light began pulsing gently.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Wait, motion sensor. We\u0027ve got activity by the main entrance.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Root crossed to the screens. \u0027Can you enhance it?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No problem.\u0027 Foaly punched in the coordinates, blowing it up 400 per cent.\\n\\n \\n\\n Root sat down on the nearest chair.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Am I seeing what I think I\u0027m seeing?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You sure are.\u0027 Foaly chuckled. \u0027This is even better than the suit of armour.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly was coming out. With the gold.\\n\\n \\n\\n Retrieval were on her in half a second.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s get you out of the danger zone, Captain,\u0027 urged a sprite, catching Holly by the elbow.\\n\\n \\n\\n Another ran a rad-sensor over her helmet.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ve got a power source breach here, Captain. We need to get your head sprayed immediately.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly opened her mouth to protest, and had it instantly filled with rad-suppressant foam.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Can\u0027t this wait?\u0027 she spluttered.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Sorry, Captain. Time is of the essence. The commander wants a debriefing before we detonate.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly was rushed towards the Mobile Ops unit, her feet barely touching the ground. All around her Retrieval Cleaners scanned the grounds for any trace of the siege. Techies dismantled the field dishes, making ready to pull the plug. Grunts steered the trolley towards the portal. It was imperative that everything be relocated to a safe distance before the bio-bomb went in.\\n\\n \\n\\n Root was waiting on the steps.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Holly,\u0027 he blurted. \u0027I mean Captain. You made it.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yessir. Thank you, sir.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027And the gold too. This is a real feather in your cap.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Well, not all, Commander. About half I think.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Root nodded. \u0027No matter. We\u0027ll have the rest soon enough.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly wiped rad-foam from her brow.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve been thinking about that, sir. Fowl made another mistake. He never ordered me not to re-enter the house, and seeing as he brought me in there in the first place, the invitation still stands. I could go in and mind-wipe the occupants. We could hide the gold in the walls and do another time-stop tomorrow night ...\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No, Captain.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But, sir ...\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Root\u0027s features regained whatever tension they\u0027d lost.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No, Captain. The Council is not about to hold off for some kidnapping Mud Man. It\u0027s just not going to happen. I have my orders, and believe me they\u0027re written in stone.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly trailed Root into the mobile.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But the girl, sir. She\u0027s an innocent!\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Casualty of war. She threw her lot in with the wrong side. Nothing can be done for her now.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly was incredulous. \u0027A casualty of war? How can you say that? A life is a life.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Root spun sharply, grasping her by the shoulders.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You did what you could, Holly,\u0027 he said. \u0027No one could have done more. You even retrieved most of the ransom. You\u0027re suffering from what humans call Stockholm Syndrome: you have bonded with your captors. Don\u0027t worry, it will pass. But those people in there, they know. About us. Nothing can save them now.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Foaly looked up from his calculations.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not true. Technically. Welcome back, by the way.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly couldn\u0027t spare even a second to return the greeting.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What do you mean not true?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m fine, seeing as you asked.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Foaly!\u0027 shouted Root and Holly in unison.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Well, like the Book says, \"If the Mud Man gold can gather, In spite of magick or fairy glamour, Then that gold is his to keep, Until he lies in eternal sleep.\" So if he lives, he wins. It\u0027s that simple. Not even the Council will go against the Book.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Root scratched his chin. \u0027Should I be worried?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Foaly laughed mirthlessly. \u0027No. Those guys are as good as dead.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027As good as isn\u0027t good enough.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Is that an order?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Affirmative, soldier.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not a soldier,\u0027 said Foaly, and pressed the button.\\n\\n \\n\\n Butler was more than a little surprised.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You gave it back?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis nodded. \u0027About half. We still have quite a nest egg. About fifteen million dollars at today\u0027s market prices.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Butler usually wouldn\u0027t ask. But this time he had to. \u0027Why, Artemis? Can you tell me?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I suppose so.\u0027 The boy smiled. \u0027I felt we owed the captain something. For services rendered.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Is that all?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis nodded. No need to talk about the wish. It could be perceived as weakness.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Hmm,\u0027 said Butler, smarter than he looked.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Now, we should celebrate,\u0027 enthused Artemis, deftly changing the subject. \u0027Some champagne, I think.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n The boy strode to the kitchen before Butler\u0027s gaze could dissect him.\\n\\n \\n\\n By the time the others caught up, Artemis had already filled three glasses with Dom Perignon.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m a minor, I know, but I\u0027m sure Mother wouldn\u0027t mind. Just this once.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Butler felt that something was afoot. Nevertheless, he took the crystal flute offered to him.\\n\\n \\n\\n Juliet looked at her big brother.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Is this OK?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I suppose so.\u0027 He took a breath. \u0027You know I love you, don\u0027t you, sis?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Juliet scowled - something else that the local louts found very endearing. She smacked her brother on the shoulder.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re so emotional for a bodyguard.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Butler looked his employer straight in the eye.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You want us to drink this, don\u0027t you, Artemis?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis met his gaze squarely. \u0027Yes, Butler. I do.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Without another word Butler drained his glass, Juliet followed suit. The manservant tasted the tranquillizer immediately, and although he would have had ample time to snap Artemis Fowl\u0027s neck, he didn\u0027t. No need for Juliet to be distressed in her final moments.\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis watched his friends sink to the floor. A pity to deceive them. But if they had been alerted to the plan, their anxiety could have counteracted the sedative. He gazed at the bubbles swirling in his own glass. Time for the most audacious step in his scheme. With only the barest hint of hesitation, he swallowed the tranquillizer-laced champagne.\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis waited calmly for the drug to take hold of his system. He didn\u0027t have to wait long, for each dose had been calculated according to body weight. As his thoughts began to swirl, it occurred to him that he might never awaken again. It\u0027s a bit late for doubts, he chided himself, and sank into unconsciousness.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s away,\u0027 said Foaly, leaning back from the console. \u0027It\u0027s out of my hands now.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n They followed the missile\u0027s progress through polarized windows. It really was a remarkable piece of equipment. Because its main weapon was light, the fallout could be focused to an exact radius. The radioactive element used in the core was solinium 2, which had a half-life of fourteen seconds. This effectively meant that Foaly could tune the bio-bomb to blue-rinse only Fowl Manor and not one blade of grass more, plus the building would be radiation-free in under a minute. In the event that a few solinium flares refused to be focused, they would be contained by the time-field. Murder made easy.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The flight path is pre-programmed,\u0027 explained Foaly, though no one was paying a blind bit of attention. \u0027She\u0027ll sail into the lobby and detonate. The casing and firing mechanism are plastic alloy and will completely disintegrate. Clean as a whistle.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Root and Holly followed the bomb\u0027s arc. As predicted, it swooped through the decimated doorway without knocking so much as a sliver of stone from the medieval walls. Holly switched her attention to the missile\u0027s nose-cam. For a moment she caught a glimpse of the grand hallway where she had, until recently, been a prisoner. It was empty. Not a human in sight. Maybe, she thought. Just maybe. Then she looked at Foaly and the technology at his fingertips. And she realized that the humans were as good as dead.\\n\\n \\n\\n The bio-bomb detonated. A blue orb of condensed light crackled and spread, filling every corner of the manor with its deadly rays. Flowers withered, insects shrivelled and fish died in their tanks. Not one cubic millimetre was spared. Artemis Fowl and his cohorts could not have escaped. It was impossible.\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly sighed, turning away from the already dwindling blue-rinse. For all his grand designs, Artemis had been a mere mortal in the end. And for some reason she mourned his passing.\\n\\n \\n\\n Root was more pragmatic. \u0027OK. Suit up. Full blackout gear.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s perfectly safe,\u0027 said Foaly. \u0027Didn\u0027t you ever listen in school?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n The commander snorted. \u0027I trust science about as far as I could throw you, Foaly. Radiation has a habit of hanging around when certain scientists have assured us it has dissipated. No one steps outside the unit without blackout gear. So that counts you out, Foaly. Only bipedal suits. Anyway I want you on monitors, just in case ...\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n In case of what? wondered Foaly, but he didn\u0027t comment. Save it for an I told you so later.\\n\\n \\n\\n Root turned to Holly.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Are you ready, Captain?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Going back in. The idea of identifying three cadavers didn\u0027t appeal to Holly. But she knew it was her duty. She was the only one with first-hand knowledge of the interior.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yessir. On my way.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly selected a blackout suit from the rack, pulling it on over her jumpsuit. As per training, she checked the gauge before tugging the vulcanized cowl. A dip in pressure would indicate a rip, which could prove fatal in the long term.\\n\\n \\n\\n Root lined up the insertion team at the perimeter. The remains of Retrieval One were about as eager to insert themselves into the manor as they would be to juggle Atlantean stink balloons.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re certain the big one is gone?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, Captain Kelp. He\u0027s gone, one way or another.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Trouble wasn\u0027t convinced. \u0027Because that\u0027s one mean human. I think he has magic of his own.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Corporal Grub giggled, and got an immediate clip on the ear for himself. He muttered something about telling Mummy and quickly strapped on his helmet.\\n\\n \\n\\n Root felt his complexion redden. \u0027Let\u0027s move out. Your mission is to locate and recover the bullion. Watch for booby traps. I didn\u0027t trust Fowl when he was alive, and I definitely don\u0027t trust him now that he\u0027s dead.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n The phrase \u0027booby traps\u0027 got everyone\u0027s attention. The idea of a Bouncing Betty anti-personnel mine exploding at head height was enough to dispel any nonchalance in the troops. No one built weapons of cruelty like the Mud Men.\\n\\n \\n\\n As the junior Recon officer, Holly was on point. And even though there weren\u0027t supposed to be any hostiles in the manor, she found her gun hand automatically straying to the Neutrino 2000.\\n\\n \\n\\n The mansion was eerily quiet, with only the fizzle of the last few solinium flares to alleviate the stillness. Death was there too, in the silence. The manor was a cradle of death. Holly could smell it. Behind those medieval walls lay the bodies of a million insects, and under its floors the cooling corpses of spiders and mice.\\n\\n \\n\\n They approached the doorway tentatively. Holly swept the area with an X-ray scanner. Nothing under the flagstones but dirt, and a nest of dead money-spiders.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Clear,\u0027 she said into her microphone. \u0027I\u0027m going in. Foaly, have you got your ears on?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m right there with you, darlin\u0027,\u0027 replied the centaur. \u0027Unless you step on a landmine, in which case I\u0027m way back in the Operations Room.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Are you getting any thermals?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not after a blue-rinse. We have residual heat signatures all over the place. Mostly solinium flares. It won\u0027t calm down for a couple of days.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But no radiation, right?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s right.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Root snorted in disbelief. Over the headsets it sounded like an elephant sneezing.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It looks like we\u0027re going to have to sweep this house the old-fashioned way,\u0027 he grumbled.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Make it quick,\u0027 advised Foaly. \u0027I give it five minutes tops before Fowl Manor rejoins the world at large.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly stepped through what used to be the doorway. The chandelier swung gently from the concussive force of the missile\u0027s detonation, but otherwise everything was as she remembered it.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The gold is downstairs. In my cell.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Nobody answered. Not in words. Someone did manage a retch. Right into the microphone. Holly spun around. Trouble was doubled over, clutching his stomach.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027 feel so good,\u0027 he groaned. A tad unnecessarily, considering the pool of vomit all over his boots.\\n\\n \\n\\n Corporal Grub took a breath, possibly to utter a sentence containing the word Mummy. What came out was a jet of concentrated bile. Unfortunately Grub didn\u0027t have the opportunity to open his visor before the illness struck. It was not a pretty sight.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Ugh,\u0027 said Holly, pressing the corporal\u0027s visor-release button. A tsunami of regurgitated rations flooded over Grub\u0027s blackout suit.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh, for heaven\u0027s sake,\u0027 muttered Root, elbowing past the brothers. He didn\u0027t get very far. One step over the threshold and he was throwing up with the rest of them.\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly pointed her helmet-cam at the stricken officers.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What the hell is going on here, Foaly?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Tm searching. Hold on.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly could hear computer keys being punched furiously.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027OK. Sudden vomiting. Spatial nausea ... Oh no.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 asked Holly. But she already knew. Maybe she always had.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s the magic,\u0027 blurted Foaly, words barely decipherable in his excitement. \u0027They can\u0027t enter the house until Fowl is dead. It\u0027s like an extreme allergic reaction. That means, unbelievable, that means ...\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027They made it,\u0027 completed Holly. \u0027He\u0027s alive. Artemis Fowl is alive.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027D\u0027Arvit,\u0027 groaned Root, and heaved another quart of vomit on to the terracotta tiles.\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly went on alone. She had to see for herself. If Fowl\u0027s corpse was here, it would be with the gold, of that she was certain.\\n\\n \\n\\n The same family portraits glared down at her, but now they seemed smug rather than austere. Holly was tempted to loose a few blasts into them from the Neutrino 2000. But that would be against the rules. If Artemis Fowl had beaten them, then that was it. There would be no recriminations.\\n\\n \\n\\n She descended the stairway to her cell. The door was still swinging slightly from the bio-bomb concussion. A solinium flare ricocheted around the room like a trapped bolt of blue lightning. Holly stepped inside, half-afraid of what she might or might not see.\\n\\n \\n\\n There was nothing. Nothing dead at any rate. Just gold. Two hundred ingots approximately. Piled on the mattress of her cot. Nice neat military rows. Good old Butler, the only human ever to take on a troll and win.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Commander? Are you receiving? Over.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Affirmative, Captain. Body count?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Negative on the bodies, sir. I found the rest of the ransom.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n There was along silence.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Leave it, Holly. You know the rules. We\u0027re pulling out.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But, sir. There must be a way ...\"\\n\\n \\n\\n Foaly broke in on the conversation. \u0027But nothing, Captain. I\u0027m counting down the seconds until daylight here, and I don\u0027t like our odds if we have to exit at high noon.\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly sighed. It made sense. The People could chose their exit time, as long as they left before the field disintegrated. It just galled her to think they\u0027d been beaten by a human. An adolescent human at that.\\n\\n \\n\\n She took a last look around the cell. A big ball of hatred had been born here, she realized, and it would have to be dealt with sooner or later. Holly jammed her pistol back into its holster. Preferably sooner. Fowl was the winner this time, but someone like him wouldn\u0027t be able to rest on his laurels. He would be back with some other moneymaking scheme. And when he arrived, he would find Holly Short waiting for him. Waiting with a big gun and a smile.\\n\\n \\n\\n The ground was soft by the time-stop perimeter. Half a millennium\u0027s bad drainage from the medieval walls had transformed the foundations into a virtual bog. So that was where Mulch surfaced.\\n\\n \\n\\n The soft ground wasn\u0027t the only reason for choosing that exact spot. The other reason was the smell. A good tunnel dwarf can pick up the scent of gold through half a kilometre of granite bedrock. Mulch Diggums had one of the best noses in the business.\\n\\n \\n\\n The hover trolley floated virtually unguarded. Two of Retrieval\u0027s finest were stationed beside the recovered ransom, but at the moment they were having a little giggle at their stricken commander.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027\u0027E can\u0027t half chuck it, can\u0027t \u0027e, Chix?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Chix nodded, mimicking Root\u0027s spewing technique.\\n\\n \\n\\n Chix Verbil\u0027s pantomime antics provided the perfect cover for a spot of pilfering. Mulch gave his tubes a clearing before clambering from the tunnel. The last thing he needed was for a sudden burst of gas to alert the LEP to his presence. He needn\u0027t have worried. He could have slapped Chix Verbil in the face with a wet stink-worm and the sprite wouldn\u0027t have noticed.\\n\\n \\n\\n In a matter of seconds, he had transferred two dozen ingots into the tunnel. It was the easiest job he had ever pulled. Mulch had to stifle a giggle as he dropped the last two bars down the hole. Julius had really done him a favour, getting him involved in this whole affair. Things couldn\u0027t have worked out much better. He was free as a bird, rich and, best of all, presumed dead. By the time the LEP realized that the gold was missing, Mulch Diggums would be half a continent away. If they realized at all.\\n\\n \\n\\n The dwarf lowered himself into the ground. It would take several trips to move his treasure trove, but it would be worth the delay. With this kind of money, he could take early retirement. He would have to completely disappear of course, but a plan was already forming in his devious mind.\\n\\n \\n\\n He would live above ground for a spell. Masquerade as a human dwarf, with an aversion to light. Perhaps buy a penthouse with thick blinds. In Manhattan perhaps, or Monte Carlo. It might seem odd, of course, a dwarf shutting himself away from the sun. But then again, he would be an obscenely rich dwarf. And humans will accept any story, however outlandish, when there\u0027s something in it for them. Preferably something green that folds.\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis could hear a voice calling his name. There was a face behind the voice, but it was blurred, hard to make out. His father perhaps?\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Father?\u0027 The word was strange in his mouth. Unused. Rusty. Artemis opened his eyes.\\n\\n \\n\\n Butler was leaning over him.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Artemis. You \u0027re awake.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Ah, Butler. It\u0027s you.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis got to his feet, head spinning with the effort. He expected Butler\u0027s hand at his elbow to steady him. It didn\u0027t come. Juliet was lying on a chaise longue, dribbling on to the cushions. Obviously the draft hadn\u0027t worn off yet.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It was just sleeping pills, Butler. Harmless.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n The manservant\u0027s eyes had a dangerous glint. \u0027Explain yourself.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis rubbed his eyes. \u0027Later, Butler. I\u0027m feeling a bit-\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Butler stepped into his path. \u0027Artemis, my sister is lying drugged on that couch. She was almost killed. So explain yourself now!\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis realized that he\u0027d been given an order. He considered being offended, then decided that perhaps Butler was right. He had gone too far.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t tell you about the sleeping pills because you\u0027d fight them. It\u0027s only natural. And it was imperative to the plan that we all go to sleep immediately.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The plan?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis lowered himself into a comfortable chair.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The time-field was the key to this whole affair. It\u0027s the LEP\u0027s ace in the hole. It\u0027s what has made them unbeatable for all these years. Any incident can be contained. That and the bio-bomb make a formidable combination.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027So why did we have to be drugged?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis smiled. \u0027Look out of the window. Don\u0027t you see? They\u0027re gone. It\u0027s over.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Butler glanced through the net curtains. The light was bright and clear. Not a hint of blue. Nevertheless, the manservant was unimpressed. \u0027They\u0027re gone for now. They\u0027ll be back tonight, I guarantee it.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No. That\u0027s against the rules. We beat them. That\u0027s it, game over.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Butler raised an eyebrow. \u0027The sleeping pills, Artemis?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not to be distracted, I see.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Butler\u0027s answer was an implacable silence.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The sleeping pills. Very well. I had to think of a way to escape the time-field. I trawled through the Book, but there was nothing. Not a clue. The People themselves have not yet developed a way. So I went back to their Old Testament, back to when their lives and ours were intertwined. You know the stories: elves that made shoes during the night, sprites that cleaned houses. Back when we coexisted to a certain extent. Magical favours in exchange for their fairy forts. The big one, of course, was Santa Claus.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Butler\u0027s eyebrows nearly jumped off the front of his face.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Santa Claus?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis raised his palms. \u0027I know, I know. I was a tad sceptical myself. But apparently our little corporate-image Santa Claus is not descended from a Turkish saint, he is a shadow of San D\u0027Klass, the third king of the Frond Elfin dynasty. He is known as San the Deluded.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not a great title, as titles go.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Admittedly. D\u0027Klass thought that the greed of the Mud People in his kingdom could be assuaged by distributing lavish gifts. He would marshal all the great wizards once a year and have them throw up a great time-stop over vast regions. Flocks of sprites would be sent out to deliver the presents while the humans were asleep. Of course, it didn\u0027t work. Human greed can never be assuaged, especially not by gifts.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Butler frowned. \u0027What if the humans ... we, that is ... What if we had woken up?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Ah yes. Excellent question. The heart of the matter. We wouldn\u0027t wake up. That is the nature of the time-stop. Whatever your state of consciousness going in, that\u0027s how you stay. You can neither wake up nor fall asleep. You must have noticed the fatigue in your bones these last few hours, yet your mind would not let you sleep.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Butler nodded. Things were getting clearer, in a roundabout sort of way.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027So my theory was that the only way to escape the time-field was to simply fall asleep. Our own consciousness was all that kept us imprisoned.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You risked an awful lot on a theory, Artemis.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not just a theory. We did have a test subject.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Who? Ah, Angeline.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes. My mother. Because of her narcotic-induced slumber, she moved with the natural order of time, unhindered by the time-field. If she had not, I would have simply surrendered to the LEP and submitted to their mind wipe.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Butler snorted. He doubted it.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027So, because we could not fall asleep naturally, I simply administered us all a dose of Mother\u0027s pills. Simple.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You cut it pretty fine though. Another minute ...\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Agreed.\u0027 The boy nodded. \u0027Things were tense there at the end. It was necessary in order to double-bluff the LEP.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n He paused so that Butler could process the information.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Well, am I forgiven?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Butler sighed. On the chaise lounge, Juliet snored like a drunken sailor. He smiled suddenly.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, Artemis. All is forgiven. Just one thing ...\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Never again. Fairies are too ... human.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re right,\u0027 said Artemis, the crow\u0027s feet deepening around his eyes. \u0027Never again. We shall restrict ourselves to more tasteful ventures in the future. Legal, I can\u0027t promise.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Butler nodded. It was close enough.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Now, young Master, shouldn\u0027t we check on your mother?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis grew paler, if that were possible. Could the captain have reneged on her promise? She would certainly be entitled to.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes. I suppose we should. Let Juliet rest. She\u0027s earned it.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n He cast his eyes upwards, along the stairs. It had been too much to hope for that he could trust the fairy. After all, he had held her captive against her will. He berated himself silently. Imagine parting with all those millions for the promise of a wish. Oh, the gullibility.\\n\\n \\n\\n Then the loft door opened.\\n\\n \\n\\n Butler drew his weapon instantly.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Artemis, behind me. Intruders.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n The boy waved him away. \u0027No, Butler. I don\u0027t think so.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n His heart pounded in his ears, blood pulsed in his fingertips. Could it be? Could it possibly be? A figure appeared on the stairs. Wraith-like in a towelled robe, her hair wet from the shower.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Arty?\u0027 she called. \u0027Arty, are you there?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis wanted to answer, he wanted to race up the grand stairway, arms outstretched. But he couldn\u0027t. His cerebral functions had deserted him.\\n\\n \\n\\n Angeline Fowl descended, one hand resting lightly on the banister. Artemis had forgotten how graceful his mother was. Her bare feet skipped over the carpeted steps and soon she was standing before him.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Morning, darling,\u0027 she said brightly, as though it were just another day.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027M-Mother,\u0027 stammered Artemis.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Well, give me a hug.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis stepped into his mother\u0027s embrace. It was warm and strong. She was wearing perfume. He felt like the boy he was.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry, Arty,\u0027 she whispered into his ear.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Sorry for what?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027For everything. For the last few months, I haven\u0027t been myself. But things are going to change. Time to stop living in the past.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis felt a tear on his cheek. He wasn\u0027t sure whose tear it was.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027And I don\u0027t have a present for you.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027A present?\u0027 said Artemis.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Of course,\u0027 sang his mother, spinning him around. \u0027Don\u0027t you know what day it is?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Day?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s Christmas Day, you silly boy. Christmas Day! Presents are traditional, are they not?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Yes, thought Artemis. Traditional. San D\u0027Klass.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027And look at this place. Drab as a mausoleum. Butler?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n The manservant hurriedly pocketed his Sig Sauer.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, ma\u0027am?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Get on the phone to Brown Thomas. The platinum set number. Reopen my account. Tell Helene I want a Yuletide makeover. The works.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, ma\u0027am. The works.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh, and wake up Juliet. I want my things moved into the main bedroom. That attic is far too dusty.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, ma\u0027am. Right away, ma\u0027am.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Angeline Fowl linked her son\u0027s arm.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Now, Arty, I want to know everything. First of all, what happened here?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Remodelling,\u0027 said Artemis. \u0027The old doorway was riddled with damp.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n Angeline frowned, completely unconvinced. \u0027I see. And how about school? Have you decided on a career?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n While his mouth answered these everyday questions, Artemis\u0027s mind was in turmoil. He was a boy again. His life was going to change utterly. His plans would have to be much more devious than usual if they were to escape his mother\u0027s attention. But it would be worth it.\\n\\n \\n\\n Angeline Fowl was wrong. She had brought him a Christmas present.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/81/243.html","bookId":370,"book":{"id":370,"title":"Artemis Fowl精灵的赎金","description":"简介： 法尔家族是国际上赫赫有名的传奇世家，家族中的阿特米斯法尔更是一个人小鬼大的奇才。自从父亲和二十五万罐可乐一同消失在冰天雪地里之后，家族重担便落到小阿特米斯肩上。为了复兴家业，阿特米斯开始全世界搜寻传说中的小精灵，在获得了精灵世界的至宝《精灵之书》后，...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12890041089f0f8.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/81","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM"}}
