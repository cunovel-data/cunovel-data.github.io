{"id":14697,"no":3,"title":"Chapter 2 Translation","content":"BY now, you must have guessed just how far Artemis Fowl was prepared to go in order to achieve his goal. But what exactly was this goal? What outlandish scheme would involve the blackmailing of an alcohol-addicted sprite? The answer was gold. Artemis\u0027s search had begun two years previously when he first became interested in surfing the Internet. He quickly found the more arcane sites: alien abduction, UFO sightings and the supernatural. But most specifically the existence of the People. Trawling through gigabytes of data, he found hundreds of references to fairies from nearly every country in the world. Each civilization had its own term for the People, but they were undoubtedly members of the same hidden family. Several stories mentioned a Book carried by each fairy. It was their Bible, containing, as it allegedly did, the history of their race and the commandments that governed their extended lives. Of course, this Book was written in Gnommish, the fairy text, and would be of no use to any human. Artemis believed that with today\u0027s technology the Book could be translated. And with this translation you could begin to exploit a whole new group of creatures. Know thine enemy was Artemis\u0027s motto, so he immersed himself in the lore of the People until he had compiled a huge database on their characteristics. But it wasn\u0027t enough. So Artemis put out a call on the Web: Irish businessman will pay large amount of US dollars to meet a fairy, sprite, leprechaun, pixie. The responses had been mostly fraudulent, but Ho Chi Minh City had paid off. Artemis was perhaps the only person alive who could take full advantage of his recent acquisition. He still retained a childlike belief in magic, tempered by an adult determination to exploit it. If there was anybody capable of relieving the fairies of some of their magical gold, it was Artemis Fowl the Second. It was early morning before they reached Fowl Manor. Artemis was anxious to bring up the file on his computer, but first he decided to call in on Mother. Angeline Fowl was bedridden. She had been since her husband\u0027s disappearance. Nervous tension, the physicians said. Nothing for it but rest and sleeping pills. That was almost a year ago. Butler\u0027s little sister, Juliet, was sitting at the foot of the stairs. Her gaze was boring a hole in the wall. Even the glitter mascara couldn\u0027t soften her expression. Artemis had seen that look already, just before Juliet had suplexed a particularly cheeky pizza boy. The suplex, Artemis gathered, was a wrestling move. An unusual obsession for a teenage girl. But then again she was, after all, a Butler. \u0027Problems, Juliet?\u0027 Juliet straightened hurriedly. \u0027My own fault, Artemis. Apparently I left a gap in the curtains. Mrs Fowl couldn\u0027t sleep.\u0027 \u0027Hmm,\u0027 muttered Artemis, scaling the oak staircase slowly. He worried about his mother\u0027s condition. She hadn\u0027t seen the light of day in a long time now. Then again, should she miraculously recover, emerging revitalized from her bedchamber, it would signal the end of Artemis\u0027s own extraordinary freedom. It would be back off to school, and no more spearheading criminal enterprises for you, my lad. He knocked gently on the arched double doors. \u0027Mother? Are you awake?\u0027 Something smashed against the other side of the door. It sounded expensive. \u0027Of course I\u0027m awake! How can I sleep in this blinding glare?\u0027 Artemis ventured inside. An antique four-poster bed threw shadowy spires in the darkness, and a pale sliver of light poked through a gap in the velvet curtains. Angeline Fowl sat hunched on the bed, her pale limbs glowing white in the gloom. \u0027Artemis, darling, where have you been?\u0027 Artemis sighed. She recognized him. That was a good sign. \u0027School trip, Mother. Skiing in Austria.\u0027 \u0027Ah, skiing,\u0027 crooned Angeline. \u0027How I miss it. Maybe when your father returns.\u0027 Artemis felt a lump in his throat. Most uncharacteristic. \u0027Yes. Perhaps when Father returns.\u0027 \u0027Darling, could you close those wretched curtains. The light is intolerable.\u0027 \u0027Of course, Mother.\u0027 Artemis felt his way across the room, wary of the low-level clothes chests scattered about the floor. Finally his fingers curled around the velvet drapes. For a moment he was tempted to throw them wide open, then he sighed and closed the gap. \u0027Thank you, darling. By the way, we really have to get rid of that maid. She is good for absolutely nothing.\u0027 Artemis held his tongue. Juliet had been a hardworking and loyal member of the Fowl household for the past three years. Time to use Mother\u0027s absent-mindedness to his advantage. \u0027You\u0027re right of course, Mother. I\u0027ve been meaning to do it for some time. Butler has a sister I believe would be perfect for the position. I think I\u0027ve mentioned her. Juliet?\u0027 Angeline frowned. \u0027Juliet? Yes, the name does seem familiar. Well, anyone would be better than that silly girl we have now. When can she start?\u0027 \u0027Straight away. I\u0027ll have Butler fetch her from the lodge.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re a good boy, Artemis. Now give Mummy a hug.\u0027 Artemis stepped into the shadowy folds of his mother\u0027s robe. She smelled perfumed, like petals in water. But her arms were cold and weak. \u0027Oh, darling,\u0027 she whispered, and the sound sent goosebumps popping down Artemis\u0027s neck. \u0027I hear things. At night. They crawl along the pillows and into my ears.\u0027 Artemis felt that lump in his throat again. \u0027Perhaps we should open the curtains, Mother.\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 his mother sobbed, releasing him from her grasp. \u0027No. Because then I could see them too.\u0027 \u0027Mother, please.\u0027 But it was no use. Angeline was gone. She crawled to the far corner of the bed, pulling the quilt under her chin. \u0027Send the new girl.\u0027 \u0027Yes, Mother.\u0027 \u0027Send her with cucumber slices and water.\u0027 \u0027Yes, Mother.\u0027 Angeline glared at him with crafty eyes. \u0027And stop calling me Mother. I don\u0027t know who you are, but you\u0027re certainly not my little Arty.\u0027 Artemis blinked back a few rebellious tears. \u0027Of course. Sorry, Moth - Sorry.\u0027 \u0027Hmm. Don\u0027t come back here again, or I\u0027ll have my husband take care of you. He\u0027s a very important man, you know.\u0027 \u0027Very well, Mrs Fowl. This is the last you\u0027ll see of me.\u0027 \u0027It had better be.\u0027 Angeline froze suddenly. \u0027Do you hear them?\u0027 Artemis shook his head. \u0027No. I don\u0027t hear any -\u0027 \u0027They\u0027re coming for me. They\u0027re everywhere.\u0027 Angeline dived for cover beneath the bedclothes. Artemis could still hear her terrified sobs as he descended the marble staircase. The Book was proving far more stubborn than Artemis had anticipated. It seemed to be almost actively resisting him. No matter which program he ran it through, the computer came up blank. Artemis hard-copied every page, tacking them to the walls of his study. Sometimes it helped to have things on paper. The script was like nothing he\u0027d seen before, and yet it was strangely familiar. Obviously a mixture of symbolic and character-based language, the text meandered around the page in no apparent order. What the program needed was some frame of reference, some central point on which to build. He separated all the characters and ran comparisons with English, Chinese, Greek, Arabic and Cyrillic texts, even with Ogham. Nothing. Moody with frustration, Artemis sent Juliet scurrying when she interrupted with sandwiches, and moved on to symbols. The most frequently recurring pictogram was a small male figure. Male, he presumed, though with the limited knowledge of the fairy anatomy he supposed it could be female. A thought struck him. Artemis opened the ancient languages file on his Power Translator and selected Egyptian. At last. A hit. The male symbol was remarkably similar to the Anubis god representation on Tutankhamen\u0027s inner-chamber hieroglyphics. This was consistent with his other findings. The first written human stories were about fairies, suggesting that their civilization predated man\u0027s own. It would seem that the Egyptians had simply adapted an existing scripture to suit their needs. There were other resemblances. But the characters were just dissimilar enough to slip through the computer\u0027s net. This would have to be done manually. Each Gnommish figure had to be enlarged, printed and then compared with the hieroglyphs. Artemis felt the excitement of success thumping inside his ribcage. Almost every fairy pictogram or letter had an Egyptian counterpart. Most were universal, such as the sun or birds. But some seemed exclusively supernatural and had to be tailored to fit. The Anubis figure, for example, would make no sense as a dog god, so Artemis altered it to read king of the fairies. By midnight, Artemis had successfully fed his findings into the Macintosh. All he had to do now was press \u0027Decode\u0027. He did so. What emerged was a long, intricate string of meaningless gibberish. A normal child would have abandoned the task long since. The average adult would probably have been reduced to slapping the keyboard. But not Artemis. This book was testing him and he would not allow it to win. The letters were right, he was certain of it. It was just the order that was wrong. Rubbing the sleep from his eyes, Artemis glared at the pages again. Each segment was bordered by a solid line. This could represent paragraphs or chapters, but they were not meant to be read in the usual left to right, top to bottom fashion. Artemis experimented. He tried the Arabic right to left and the Chinese columns. Nothing worked. Then he noticed that each page had one thing in common - a central section. The other pictograms were arranged around this pivotal area. So a central starting point perhaps. But where to go from there? Artemis scanned the pages for some other common factor. After several minutes he found it. There was on each page a tiny spearhead in the corner of one section. Could this be an arrow? A direction? Go this way? So the theory would be start in the middle, then follow the arrow, reading in spirals. The computer program wasn\u0027t built to handle something like this, so Artemis had to improvise. With a craft knife and ruler, he dissected the first page of the Book and reassembled it in the traditional Western languages order - left to right, parallel rows. Then he rescanned the page and fed it through the modified Egyptian translator. The computer hummed and whirred, converting all the information to binary. Several times it stopped to ask for confirmation of a character or symbol. This happened less and less as the machine learned the new language. Eventually two words flashed on the screen: File converted. Fingers shaking from exhaustion and excitement, Artemis clicked \u0027Print\u0027. A single page scrolled from the LaserWriter. It was in English now. Yes, there were mistakes, some fine-tuning needed, but it was perfectly legible and, more importantly, perfectly understandable. Fully aware that he was probably the first human in several thousand years to decode the magical words, Artemis switched on his desk light and began to read. The Booke of the People. Being instructions to our magicks and life rules Carry me always, carry me well. I am thy teacher of herb and spell. I am thy link to power arcane. Forget me and thy magick shall wane. Ten times ten commandments there be. They will answer every mystery. Cures, curses, alchemy. These secrets shall be thine, through me. But, Fairy, remember this above all. I am not for those in mud that crawl. And forever doomed shall be the one, Who betrays my secrets one by one. Artemis could hear the blood pumping in his ears. He had them. They would be as ants beneath his feet. Their every secret would be laid bare by technology. Suddenly the exhaustion claimed him and he sank back in his chair. There was so much yet to complete. Forty-three pages to be translated for a start. He pressed the intercom button that linked him to speakers all over the house. \u0027Butler. Get Juliet and come up here. There are some jigsaws I need you to assemble.\u0027 Perhaps a little family history would be useful at this point. The Fowls were, indeed, legendary criminals. For generations they had skirmished on the wrong side of the law, hoarding enough funds to become legitimate. Of course, once they were legitimate they found it not to their liking and returned almost immediately to crime. It was Artemis the First, our subject\u0027s father, who had thrown the family fortune into jeopardy. With the break-up of communist Russia, Artemis Senior had decided to invest a huge chunk of the Fowl fortune in establishing new shipping lines to the vast continent. New consumers, he reasoned, would need new consumer goods. The Russian Mafia did not take too kindly to a Westerner muscling in on their market and so decided to send a little message. This message took the form of a stolen Stinger missile launched at the Fowl Star on her way past Murmansk. Artemis Senior was on board the ship, along with Butler\u0027s uncle and 250,000 cans of cola. It was quite an explosion. The Fowls were not left destitute, far from it. But billionaire status was no longer theirs. Artemis the Second vowed to remedy this. He would restore the family fortune. And he would do it in his own unique fashion. Once the Book was translated, Artemis could begin planning in earnest. He already knew what the ultimate goal was, now he could figure out how to achieve it. Gold, of course, was the objective. The acquisition of gold. It seemed that the People were almost as fond of the precious metal as humans. Each fairy had its own cache, but not for much longer if Artemis had his way. There would be at least one of the fairy folk wandering around with empty pockets by the time he\u0027d finished. After eighteen solid hours of sleep and a light continental breakfast, Artemis climbed to the study that he had inherited from his father. It was a traditional enough room - dark oak and floor-to-ceiling shelving - but Artemis had jammed it with the latest computer technology. A series of networked AppleMacs whirred from various corners of the room. One was running CNN\u0027s web site through a DAT projector, throwing oversized current-affairs images against the back wall. Butler was there already, firing up the hard drives. \u0027Shut them all down, except the Book. I need quiet for this.\u0027 The manservant started. The CNN site had been running for almost a year. Artemis was convinced that news of his father\u0027s rescue would come from there. Shutting it down meant that he was finally letting go. \u0027All of them?\u0027 Artemis glanced at the back wall for a moment. \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said finally. \u0027All of them.\u0027 Butler took the liberty of patting his employer gently on the shoulder, just once, before returning to work. Artemis cracked his knuckles. Time to do what he did best - plot dastardly acts.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/81/236.html","bookId":370,"book":{"id":370,"title":"Artemis Fowl精灵的赎金","description":"简介： 法尔家族是国际上赫赫有名的传奇世家，家族中的阿特米斯法尔更是一个人小鬼大的奇才。自从父亲和二十五万罐可乐一同消失在冰天雪地里之后，家族重担便落到小阿特米斯肩上。为了复兴家业，阿特米斯开始全世界搜寻传说中的小精灵，在获得了精灵世界的至宝《精灵之书》后，...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12890041089f0f8.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/81","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM"}}
