The rounds would penetrate flesh, but they couldn\u0027t kill anyone—not unless she hit the temple or eyes.\\n\\n \"Okay,\" John said, \"this is supposed to be a training exercise, but this is the seventh time Chief Mendez has made us play with Tango Company.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re getting pretty tired of losing,\" Fred remarked with a wry smile.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not a good thing,\" Linda told him and flipped a stray strand of red hair out of her face. \"They\u0027re not going to play fair.\\n\\n You heard the sniper we captured. He said that this time their Captain told them to win no matter what—even if they had to bloody a few of us to do it.\"\\n\\n John nodded. \"So we\u0027ll return the favor and do whatever it takes to win, too.\" He grabbed a twig and scratched a square in the leaf-covered dirt. \"I\u0027ll have command of Red Team: That\u0027s me, Sam, Kelly, and Fhajad. Linda, you lead Blue Team.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not \u0027Blue Team,\u0027 \" Fred complained, and his face soured.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s just me. How come I have to stay and play sniper?\" He flexed his hands, and John could sense his pent-up eagerness to get into close-range combat.\\n\\n \"Because you\u0027re our second-best shot,\" John told him. \"And we.....\"\\n\\n \"Count on it,\" Linda replied and locked her dark green eyes with John\u0027s.\\n\\n He wondered if that\u0027s what her eyes looked like when she sighted through the sniper scope. She never seemed to blink; she always won in games of stare-down.\\n\\n \"After we get the flag,\" he continued, \"Red Team will get out of there. Watch for targets of opportunity and cover us. We rendezvous at the LZ and hopefully no one finds us before then.\"\\n\\n Fred nodded. Linda hefted her new rifle, which was almost too large for her to look through the scope and rest the butt against the hollow of her shoulder at the same time. \"You\u0027ll be in good hands.\"\\n\\n John closed his eyes and ran over the details of his plan again in his head. Yes—everything gelled; their odds were good. He knew they\u0027d win.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t come out from hiding at the LZ until I give the all-clear signal,\" he reminded them. \"We could be captured...\\n\\n they could make us talk.\"\\n\\n They all nodded, remembering what Tango Company had done to James. He \"fell down a flight of stairs\" as they had escorted him from cell to cell in their single-story jail. James hadn\u0027t broken ... not mentally, at least. But John wished he had; it had taken James a whole week to recover.\\n\\n No—he took back that thought. He was glad James hadn\u0027t broken. John would have tried to do the same.\\n\\n John whistled the little six-note singsong tune Deja had taught them—their all-clear signal. He stood, holstered his dart pistol, and checked the three stun grenades on his belt. \"I\u0027ll see you at the LZ.\"\\n\\n \"Okay. Check your mirrors.\"\\n\\n They all pulled out the shards of mirror they had taken from Tango Company\u0027s latrine last night. They had taped the edges so they could be handled more easily, and taped their backs to re- duce the chance they\u0027d shatter. The whole operation depended on a fragile piece of glass, which had John worried.\\n\\n \"Just hand signals from here on out,\" John told them. \"Move out, Red Team.\"\\n\\n They crouched and clawed and slithered through the forest until they reached a gravel track. They pushed two large rocks off the nearby hill, blocking the road, then waited in the brush.\\n\\n Headlights appeared as a supply truck rumbled down the road and squealed to a halt. Two soldiers got out and scanned the area.\\n\\n \"Think it\u0027s an ambush?\" one of them muttered and gripped his rifle tighter.\\n\\n \"From those freak Section Three kids? Jesus, I don\u0027t know,\"\\n\\n the driver said. \"Screw the rules of this exercise.\" He pulled a Kevlar poncho over his head. \"I\u0027m not gonna take a dart in my ass if it is. Cover me.\"\\n\\n The man riding shotgun got out and walked around the truck.\\n\\n \"Looks clear,\" he whispered. \"Hurry.\"\\n\\n The driver jumped out of the cab, moved to the rocks, and rolled them off the road.\\n\\n John ran from the brush and crawled under the vehicle. He pulled himself up and wedged tight against the undercarriage, close enough that he smelled the rubber from the new tires.\\n\\n Kelly and Sam came next; Fhajad was last.\\n\\n They hadn\u0027t been spotted. So far, so good.\\n\\n The two men got back into the truck and proceeded down the dirt road.\\n\\n Gravel bounced up and caught John in the side of the head, and cut him; blood trickled from his ear along his neck, but he didn\u0027t dare loosen his grip.\\n\\n After a kilometer of being pelted by rocks and stung by sand, the truck eased to a halt at Tango Company\u0027s base. The guard at the gatehouse spoke to the driver, and they laughed. The guard then walked around and opened the back of the truck.\\n\\n John squirmed and got his mirror ready. With a flick of his hand, he signaled the others to do the same. John held his mirror at an angle pointed at the undercarriage of the truck. His hand trembled but he forced himself to be steady. He had to.\\n\\n The gate guard approached the truck with a long pole and a small mirror attached at one end. He stuck the mirror under the truck and swept it along one side.\\n\\n John matched the position of the mirror with his, moved it steady along as the gate guard passed him so all the guard saw was the reflected image of the undercarriage—a meter to John\u0027s left.\\n\\n They\u0027d practiced this maneuver all last night. It had to be perfect.\\n\\n The guard moved on to Sam\u0027s position, and then Fhajad\u0027s, and finally to Kelly\u0027s corner of the truck.\\n\\n Kelly\u0027s mirror slipped and she fumbled—caught it just before it hit the ground. John held his breath; Kelly barely got the re- flective surface in place as the gate guard swept her section.\\n\\n \"Go ahead,\" the guard said and rapped the side of the truck.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re clean.\"\\n\\n \"How are the dogs?\" the driver asked.\\n\\n \"Still sick,\" the guard muttered. \"Not sure what the heck they all ate last night, but they\u0027re still squirting.\"\\n\\n \"Damn,\" the driver said. He started the engine and rolled into Tango Company\u0027s base camp.\\n\\n Last night Fred had fed the guard dogs a paste made of a few squirrels they\u0027d caught, some unripe berries, and the antibacterial ointment in their first-aid kits—a concoction guaranteed to keep Tango\u0027s dogs out of the picture for another day.\\n\\n The truck parked inside a warehouse. Two men came and un- loaded the back and then left, locking the doors of the warehouse behind them.\\n\\n John and the others finally eased themselves down from the truck. None of them spoke. A single word overheard now could blow the entire operation. They silently massaged their aching muscles. John bandaged his ear to stop the bleeding.\\n\\n John pointed to Sam and then at the hood of the truck. Sam nodded and got to work. John then pointed at Fhajad and to the side door. Fhajad moved to the entrance and began to pick the lock.\\n\\n John and Kelly patrolled the warehouse, looking for cameras, dogs, guards, anything they\u0027d have to remove. It was clear.\\n\\n Sam returned with four canteens, which he had, according to their plan, filled with battery acid from the truck.\\n\\n There was a click from the side door and Fhajad gave them a thumbs-up. They gathered near the door. Fhajad eased it open, peeked out the crack, then opened it a little more and glanced to either side.\\n\\n He nodded and moved out, keeping well away from the over- head lights, skirting the shadows of the warehouse.\\n\\n John and the others followed, pausing in the darkest part of the shadows. John held up five fingers, and Sam passed out the canteens of acid. John pointed to his watch and again flashed five fingers.\\n\\n They nodded.\\n\\n John then pointed to Kelly, and with two fingers pointed to the perimeter of the camp and made a guillotine-cutting mo- tion onto his other hand. Kelly nodded and vanished into the darkness.\\n\\n Sam and Fhajad moved off as well, making their way to the barracks houses they had previously reconnoitered. There was a crawl space under each building.\\n\\n John sprinted to the farthest barracks and slipped underneath.\\n\\n He paused for a moment, listening for any noise, a footfall, an alarm—it was still quiet. They were undetected... which would last for only another five minutes.\\n\\n He took three sticks of chewing gum from his pocket, popped them into his mouth, and chewed. John crawled to the center of the building. He carefully took a rag from his shirt pocket, poured acid onto it, and then dabbed the rag to the underside of the wood floor. He was extremely careful not to soak the rag or get any acid on himself. When he touched the rag to the ply- wood, the wood smoldered.\\n\\n After he had soaked a meter-square patch, he checked his watch. Thirty seconds until it was 0455. Just enough time. He primed all three of his stun grenades, set their timers for five minutes, then used the chewing gum to attach the grenades to the perimeter of the acid-weakened section of floor.\\n\\n Normally the stun grenades couldn\u0027t penetrate centimeter-thick plywood. Once the acid had eaten through the porous fibers, however, the three grenades would have more than enough bang to turn that meter-square section into a million airborne splinters—shot straight up into the sleeping quarters of Tango Company. Not lethal ... but guaranteed to be one heck of a distraction.\\n\\n John crawled out, crept back to the warehouse, and ren- dezvoused with the rest of Red Team.\\n\\n John glanced at his watch: 0458.\\n\\n He pointed to Kelly and then to himself, then made a curling motion around one side of the warehouse. He pointed to Sam and Fhajad and motioned them around the opposite side. They moved to the far corners of the building.\\n\\n John and Kelly crouched and waited. They had a perfect view of the center of the camp, the calisthenics area, the parade grounds, and—right in the center—the flagpole.\\n\\n Right on time a Corporal and two guard escorts marched out and unfolded their green-striped flag. He attached one corner to a lanyard dangling from the pole.\\n\\n John glanced at the distant forest. The woods past the fence of Tango Company\u0027s camp had been clear-cut. He knew it was more than a hundred meters—closer to two hundred. There was no guarantee that Fred or Linda could hit anything at that range.\\n\\n He drew his dart pistol and clicked off its safety.\\n\\n At 0500 flashes of light strobed beneath the barracks as the grenades detonated. There was the crackle of wood and the screams of the men and women ofTango Company.\\n\\n The Corporal attaching the flag dropped one end and whirled around. Floodlights on the perimeter fence snapped on and pointed inward toward the barracks.\\n\\n In the confusion, no one noticed as one of the guards near the flagpole dropped his rifle, grabbed his neck ... and toppled to the gravel face-first.\\n\\n His partner spotted him and knelt.\\n\\n John sprinted across the compound, firing. His first shot went wild, and the kneeling guard spun around to face him. Fhajad and Sam shot him in the back.\\n\\n John took aim at the Corporal—who fumbled with his pistol holster, trying to free his weapon. John planted two narq-darts in his chest. The Corporal dropped.\\n\\n Two more guards rounded the corner of the warehouse, shouted, and took aim at John.\\n\\n He was out in the open, and there was no way his dart pistol could hit those guards from this distance.\\n\\n One guard fired. The round pinged off the flagpole not five centimeters from John\u0027s head.\\n\\n The guard stiffened and dropped his rifle, wildly grabbing at the back of his head ... and the dart stuck into his skull. He screamed and fell, thrashing in the dirt.\\n\\n The other guard twitched and pulled a dart from his thigh. An- other dart hit him in the chest, and he sprawled to the ground.\\n\\n John sent his silent thanks to Linda and Fred. He detached the flag from the lanyard and stuffed it into his shirt.\\n\\n He waved Red Team forward, and Kelly led them to the fences.\\n\\n Kelly didn\u0027t slow down as she sprinted and closed on the chain-link fence. She tucked and threw herself into the steel mesh.\\n\\n Just before she hit, John spotted the smoking outlines on the fence where she had applied the battery acid.\\n\\n The fence broke in a jagged outline, and Kelly rolled to her feet on the other side without missing a stride. John waved his team through. He went last, pausing only a fraction of a second to look back.\\n\\n The camp was in chaos. Security lights swung about, there were screams from the barracks. A tank rumbled to life and crunched into the center of the base.\\n\\n John ran. Behind them came the staccato report of machine-gun fire—just as they entered the safety of the forest.\\n\\n John smiled, panting. \"Good work, everyone,\" he whispered.\\n\\n \"I think those guys were using live ammo this time.\"\\n\\n Kelly held up a brass case from a 7.62mm round. \"Yep,\" she said. \"No doubt.\"\\n\\n \"Come on,\" John said, \"let\u0027s not stick around. If they weren\u0027t before, they\u0027re pissed now.\"\\n\\n Red Team slinked through the forest. They kept to the shad- ows, and took cover under logs when a Pelican roared overhead looking for them.\\n\\n At 0545 they made it to the clearing designated as their ex- traction LZ. At 0700 hours they were supposed to meet CPO Mendez. Of course, the Chief rarely let them get off this easy— so John had planned for Blue Team to be here as well... only they would remain hidden. Linda and Fred would post some- where in the treetops and cover Red Team until they were sure it was safe.\\n\\n Red Team hunkered down in the brush and waited. They weren\u0027t safe; John knew that. Tango Company would be looking for them, and this is when his team would get anxious ... when they would want to talk and brag about their successful mission, or look at the captured flag. To their credit, Red Team stayed still and silent. And Blue Team was nowhere to be seen.\\n\\n At 0610 the thunderous roar of a Pelican\u0027s engines filled the air and the craft slowly descended and landed in the clearing.\\n\\n The aft hatch popped open.\\n\\n Fhajad started to move, but John set his hand on his shoulder.\\n\\n \"Too early,\" he whispered. \"When is the Chief not perfectly on time?\"\\n\\n Fhajad, Kelly, and Sam grimly nodded.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll go,\" John said. \"You guys back up Blue Team.\"\\n\\n They gave him a thumbs-up. Sam patted him on the back and whispered, \"Don\u0027t worry, I won\u0027t let them do anything to you.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-first-strike-halo-3/page-22.html","bookId":1635,"book":{"id":1635,"title":"Halo: First Strike (Halo #3)","description":"Storyline: Halo: First Strike (Halo #3) \\n The Human-Covenant war rages on as the alien juggernaut sweeps inexorably toward its final goal: destruction of all human life! \\n Halo has been destroyed, and the threat it posed to sentient life, neutralized.
