Normally such strong gravitational fields would distort and collapse the Shaw-Fujikawa event horizon.\n With the Covenant\u0027s Slipspace matrices, however, I had greatly increased resolution. I was able to compensate.\"\n \"Amazing,\" he whispered.\n \"Goddamned lucky,\" Polaski muttered. She tugged on the rim of her cap.\n \"It worked,\" the Master Chief told them. \"For now, that\u0027s all that matters.\" He faced his team, trying to ignore the motions of the Covenant Engineer attached to his back. \"We have to plan our next move.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry to disagree, Chief,\" Lieutenant Haverson said.\n \"The mere fact that Cortana\u0027s maneuver worked is the only thing that matters now.\"\n The Chief squared himself to the Lieutenant and said nothing.\n Haverson held up his hands. \"I acknowledge that you have tactical command, Chief. I know your authority has the backing of the brass and ONI Section Three. You\u0027ll get no argument from me on that point, but I put it to you that your original mission has just been superseded by the discovery of the technology on this ship. We should scrub your mission and head straight back to Earth.\"\n \"What\u0027s this other mission?\" Locklear asked, his voice suspicious.\n Haverson shrugged. \"I see no reason to keep this information classified at this point. Tell him, Chief.\"\n The Master Chief didn\u0027t like how Haverson \"acceded\" to his tactical command yet readily ordered him to reveal highly classified material.\n \"Cortana,\" the Chief said. \"Is the bridge secure from eaves-droppers?\"\n \"A moment,\" Cortana said. Red lights pulsed around the room\u0027s perimeter. \"It is now. Go ahead, Chief.\"\n \"My team and I—\" the Master Chief started.\n He hesitated—the thought of his fellow Spartans stopped him cold. For all he knew they were all dead. He pushed that to the back of his mind, however, and continued.\n \"Our mission was to capture a Covenant ship, infiltrate Covenant-controlled space, and capture one of their leaders.\n Command hoped they could use this to force the Covenant into a cease-fire and negotiations.\"\n No one said a word.\n Finally, Locklear snorted and rolled his eyes. \"Typical Navy suicide mission.\"\n \"No,\" the Master Chief replied. \"It was a long shot, but we had a chance. We have a better chance now that we have this ship.\"\n \"Excuse me, Master Chief,\" Polaski said. She removed her cap and wrung it in her hands. \"You\u0027re not suggesting that you\u0027re going to continue that half-assed op, are you? We barely survived four days of hell. It was a miracle we got away from Reach, survived the Covenant on Halo... not to mention the Flood.\"\n \"I have a duty to complete my mission,\" the Master Chief told her. \"I\u0027ll do it with or without your help. There\u0027s more at stake than our individual discomfort—even our lives.\"\n \"We\u0027re not Spartans,\" Haverson said. \"We\u0027re not trained for your kind of mission.\"\n That was certainly true. They weren\u0027t Spartans. John\u0027s team would never give up. But as he scanned their weary faces, he had to acknowledge that they weren\u0027t ready for this mission.\n The Sergeant stepped forward and said, \"You still want to go, I got your back, Chief.\"\n John nodded, but he saw the exhaustion even in the Sergeant\u0027s dark eyes. There were limits to what any soldier, even a hard- core Marine like Johnson, could endure. And as much as he didn\u0027t want to admit it, his original orders, given only a week ago, felt as if they\u0027d been issued a lifetime in the past. Even John felt the temptation to stop and regroup before continuing.\n \"What\u0027s on this ship,\" Haverson said, \"can save the human race. And wasn\u0027t that the goal of your mission? Let\u0027s return to Earth and let the Admiralty decide. No one would question your decision to clarify your orders given the circumstances—\" He paused, then added, \"and the loss of your entire team.\"\n Haverson\u0027s expression was carefully neutral, but the Chief still bristled at the further mention of his team—and at the at- tempt to manipulate him. He remembered his order sending Fred, Kelly, and the others to the surface of Reach, thinking that he, Linda, and James were going on the \"hard\" mission.\n \"Listen to the El-Tee,\" Locklear said. \"We deliver a little something for the R-and-D eggheads and maybe buy some shore leave. I vote for that plan.\" He saluted Haverson. \"Hell yeah!\"\n \"This isn\u0027t a democracy,\" the Master Chief said, his voice both calm and dangerous.\n Locklear twitched but didn\u0027t back down. \"Yeah, maybe it isn\u0027t,\"\n he said, \"but last time I checked, I take my orders from the Corps— not from some swabbie. Sir.\"\n The Sergeant scowled at the ODST and moved to his side.\n \"You better get it together, Marine,\" he barked, \"or the Chief\u002711 reach down and pull you inside out by your cornhole. And that\u0027ll be a sweet, sweet mercy ... compared to what I\u0027m gonna do to you.\"\n Locklear contemplated the Sergeant\u0027s words and the Master Chief\u0027s silence. He looked to Polaski and then to Haverson.\n Polaski stared at the Marine with wide eyes, then turned away.\n Haverson gave him a slight shake of his head.\n Locklear sighed, eased his stance, and dropped his gaze.\n \"Man, I really, really hate this shit.\"\n \"I hate to interrupt,\" Cortana said, \"but I find myself agreeing with the Lieutenant.\"\n The Chief clicked on a private COM channel. \"Explain, Cor- tana. I thought our mission was what you were built for. Why are you backing out now?\"\n \"I\u0027m not \u0027backing out,\u0027 \" she shot back. \"Our orders were given when the UNSC had a fleet, and when Reach was still an intact military presence. All that has changed.\"\n The Master Chief couldn\u0027t disagree with what she was say- ing ... but there was something else in her voice. And for the first time, John thought that Cortana might be hiding something from him.\n \"We have intact ship-scale plasma weapons and new reactor technologies,\" Cortana continued. \"Imagine if every ship could maneuver with pinpoint precision in Slipspace.\" She paused.\n \"The UNSC could be just as effective in space as you are in ground engagements. We could actually win this war.\"\n The Master Chief frowned. He didn\u0027t like the Lieutenant\u0027s or Cortana\u0027s arguments—because they made sense. Aborting his mission was unthinkable. He had always finished what he started, and he\u0027d always won.\n As a professional soldier, John was ready to give up anything for victory—his personal comfort, his friends, his own life if that\u0027s what it took—but he\u0027d never considered that he\u0027d have to sacrifice his dignity and pride as well for the greater good.\n He sighed and nodded. \"Very well, Lieutenant Haverson.\n We\u0027ll do it your way. I hereby relinquish my tactical command.\"\n \"Good,\" Haverson said. \"Thank you.\" He faced the others and continued, \"Sergeant? You, Polaski, and Locklear get back down to the Pelican and grab whatever gear wasn\u0027t smashed to bits.\n Look for a field medkit, too, and then get back up here, double time.\"\n \"Yes, sir,\" Sergeant Johnson said. \"We\u0027re on it.\" He and Polaski headed for the door, tapped the control, and let the panels slide apart.\n Polaski shot a stare at the Master Chief over her shoulder; then, shaking her head, she followed the Sergeant.\n \"Shit,\" Locklear said, checking his rifle as he loped after them.\n \"Wait up! Man, I\u0027m never going to get another hour\u0027s sleep.\"\n \"Sleep when you\u0027re dead, Marine,\" the Sergeant said.\n The bridge doors sealed.\n Haverson said, \"Plot a course back to Earth, Cortana, and then—\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Lieutenant Haverson,\" Cortana said. \"I can\u0027t do that. A direct course to Earth would be in violation of the Cole Protocol. Furthermore, we are not allowed an indirect route, ei- ther. Subsection Seven of the Cole Protocol states that no Cove- nant craft may be taken to human-controlled space without an exhaustive search for tracking systems that could lead the enemy to our bases.\"\n \"Subsection Seven?\" Haverson said. \"I haven\u0027t heard of it.\"\n \"Very few have, sir,\" Cortana answered. \"It was little more than a technicality. Before this, no one had actually ever captured a Covenant vessel.\"\n \"An exhaustive search of this vessel would be difficult under the circumstances,\" Haverson said and cupped his hand over his chin, thinking. \"It must be more than three kilometers long.\"\n \"I have a suggestion, sir,\" the Chief said. \"An intermediate destination: Reach.\"\n \"Reach?\" Haverson quickly hid the shock on his face with a smile. \"Chief, there\u0027s nothing in the Reach system except a Covenant armada.\"\n \"No, sir,\" the Master Chief replied. \"There are . . . other possibilities.\"\n Haverson raised an eyebrow. \"Go ahead, Chief. I\u0027m intrigued.\"\n \"The first possibility,\" John said, \"is that the Covenant have glassed the planet and moved on. In which case there might be a derelict, but serviceable, UNSC craft that we could repair and take to Earth. We\u0027d leave the Covenant flagship in low orbit and return with the proper scientific staff and equipment to effect a salvage operation.\"\n Haverson nodded. \"A long shot. Although the Euphrates did have a Prowler attached to her. They were supposed to launch a reconnaissance mission, before they got the signal to drop everything and help defend Reach. So maybe it\u0027s not such a long shot, after all. And the other possibility?\"\n \"The Covenant are still there,\" the Master Chief said. \"The likelihood that they would attack one of their own capital ships is low. In either event, there is no violation of the Cole Protocol because the Covenant already know the location of Reach.\"\n \"True,\" Haverson said. He paced to the center of the bridge.\n \"Very well, Chief. Cortana, set course for Reach. We\u0027ll enter at the edge of the system and assess the situation. If it\u0027s too hot, we jump and find another route home.\"\n \"Acknowledged, Lieutenant,\" Cortana replied. \"Be advised that this ship traverses Slipspace much faster than our UNSC counterparts. ETA to Reach in thirteen hours.\"\n The Master Chief sighed and relaxed a little. There was an- other reason for choosing Reach, one he didn\u0027t reveal to the Lieutenant. He knew the odds of anyone surviving on the sur- face were remote. Astronomical, in fact ... because once the Covenant decided to glass a planet, they did so with amazing thoroughness. But he had to see it. It was the only way he could accept that his teammates were dead.\n A wash of static covered the Chief, first along his spine and then wrapping about his torso. There was an audible pop, and sparks crackled along the length of his MJOLNIR armor.\n The Engineer released its grasp on him and cluttered with excitement.\n Diagnostic routines scrolled upon the Chief\u0027s heads-up dis- play. In the upper right corner the shield recharge bar flickered red and slowly filled.\n \"They work,\" the Master Chief said. John was relieved to have his shields back. He wouldn\u0027t forget what it was like to fight without them, though. It had been a wake-up call: not to become dependent upon technology. It was also a reminder that most battles were won or lost in his head, before he engaged any enemy.\n \"Impressive little creatures,\" Haverson remarked. He scrutinized the Covenant Engineer as it floated toward the wall of dis- plays and began tinkering with one. \"I wonder how the Covenant caste system—\"\n \"Sir!\" Sergeant Johnson\u0027s voice blasted over the COM, breaking with static. \"You\u0027ve got to get down to the Pelican ASAP. You and the Chief.\"\n \"Are you under fire?\" the Chief asked.\n \"Negative,\" he replied. \"It\u0027s one of the cryotubes you recovered.\"\n \"What about it, Sergeant?\" Haverson snapped.\n \"Chief, there\u0027s a Spartan in it.\"\n CHAPTER TEN\n 1852 hours, September 22,2552 (Military Calendar) \\ Captured Covenant flagship, in Slipspace, location unknown.\n After the Chief had left to investigate the cryopod, Haverson made certain that the bridge doors locked. He turned and walked over to the Covenant Engineer who\u0027d repaired the Master Chief\u0027s armor.\n \"Fascinating creatures,\" he murmured. He drew his sidearm and pointed it at the back of its head.\n Two of the Engineer\u0027s six eyes locked onto the muzzle of the weapon. A tentacle reached for it, split into fine probing threads, and touched the blue-gray metal.\n Cortana asked, \"What are you—\"\n Haverson shot the Engineer. The round tore through its head and spattered gore across the display the alien had been repairing.\n \"Haverson!\" Cortana cried.\n The other Engineer turned and squealed—then a blinking light on the broken display captured its attention and it returned to its work, oblivious.\n Haverson knelt by the dead Engineer and holstered his gun. \"I had no other choice,\" he whispered. He touched the creature\u0027s odd, slick skin. Its color faded from a faint pink to a cold gray.\n He dragged it to the escape hatch, opened it, and placed the body in the corridor. He paused, and went back to fold its tenta- cles over its body. \"I\u0027m sorry. You didn\u0027t deserve it.\"\n \"Why was that necessary?\" Cortana demanded.\n Haverson stood, wiped his hands on his slacks, and sealed the escape hatch access. \"I\u0027m surprised you even have to ask, Cor- tana.\" He heard the anger in his voice. He checked his rising ire.\n He wasn\u0027t mad at Cortana; he was mad at himself—furious be- cause of the ugly necessity of his act.\n \"The Covenant are imitative—not innovative,\" he said. \"The Engineer you ordered to repair the Chief\u0027s armor just got a first-hand look at our shield technology, a technology we stole from the Covenant and improved upon. If it somehow managed to re- join the Covenant, that improved technology would be theirs.\n How would you like to see that technology manifest as better personal shields for their Elite warriors? Or on their warships?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-first-strike-halo-3/page-13.html","bookId":1635,"book":{"id":1635,"title":"Halo: First Strike (Halo #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Halo: First Strike (Halo #3) \n The Human-Covenant war rages on as the alien juggernaut sweeps inexorably toward its final goal: destruction of all human life! \n Halo has been destroyed, and the threat it posed to sentient life, neutralized.
