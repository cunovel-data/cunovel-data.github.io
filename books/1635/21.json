{"id":97119,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"If any one of the Spartans could be called a \"lone wolf,\" it was Linda. In many ways that made her the strongest of them. To see her like this ... John wiped away the condensation that formed over her hel-meted head. She was neither dead nor alive. She was in some twilight place in between. That uncertainty was worse than seeing her broken and burned body on Gamma Station. It felt like an open wound in John\u0027s chest. Linda\u0027s prognosis was good. The occupants of the other two cryopods hadn\u0027t made it. Some kind of energy discharge had de- activated the units, and those inside had died cold bleak deaths. There was a gentle knock on the hull of the Pelican, and Sergeant Johnson pulled himself inside. \"Master Chief,\" he said. \"You got the air scrubbers? The remote COM? Polaski says she\u0027s ready to call it a day with that Covenant dropship. We need to get on board and work.\" The Master Chief stood and nodded to the aft hatch, where he had stripped the air scrubbers and COM from the Pelican. The Sergeant picked up the gear, and then he and the Chief crawled out of the Pelican. The Chief hesitated and looked back atthecryotube. \"Don\u0027t you worry about her,\" Johnson said. \"Hell, I been hit worse and she\u0027s three times the soldier I am. She\u0027ll pull through.\" The Chief sealed the hatch without comment. He had heard the same hollow promises a hundred times before with critically wounded men. Why was it that soldiers would face their own deaths without blinking an eye... but when faced with the death of a squadmate, they turned away and lied to themselves? They silently marched across the hangar. It had been cleared of debris and bodies, and Warrant Officer Polaski had, for the last six hours, been practicing inside the space with the intact Covenant dropship. She spun the odd U-shaped craft around on its center axis, shimmied to port, rose, and then floated down for a landing. Johnson squinted his dark eyes at her performance and nod- ded approvingly. \"She says that she\u0027s figured out the weapon controls, too. No way to test them in here, of course.\" \"Understood,\" the Master Chief replied. \"And the rest of the team\u0027s progress?\" \"I\u0027ve got the doors from here to the bridge and to the engine room welded shut,\" Sergeant Johnson told him. \"If those transient sensor contacts that Cortana keeps picking up are anything, they\u0027ll have to cut through to get to us. \"Locklear\u0027s grabbing some sack time. He needed it.\" The Sergeant shrugged. \"He\u0027ll be fine, though; ODSTs are tough as nails. Lieutenant Haverson slept some then got up, had a long conversation with Cortana, and started reading through some of the Covenant database. Everyone seems to be fine, considering what we\u0027ve been through.\" \"Understood,\" the Chief said. \"Cortana? Ship status?\" \"ETA to Reach in twenty minutes,\" she said. The Chief checked his mission clock. \"You said thirteen hours\u0027 total travel time. By my count, we have approximately two hours to go.\" \"I had determined it would be thirteen hours based on the spec- ifications of the Covenant Slipspace drive, but there\u0027s ...\" Her voice trailed off and faded. \"Cortana?\" \"Sorry. There\u0027s a curious time-dilation effect at these Slip-space velocities. Although, technically, velocity, acceleration, and for that matter even time have no meaning in the folds of Slipspace. I thought I told you all this,\" she said. Irritation crept into her voice. The Chief looked to the Sergeant, who shook his head and shrugged. Cortana sounded more than distracted—and she didn\u0027t just \"forget\" things. It was a bad sign. They depended on her to fly this ship, and if she started falling apart they were in real trouble. The Master Chief opened a COM channel. \"Change of plans, team. Reach ETA is nineteen minutes. I\u0027ll explain later—just grab your gear and meet on the bridge ASAP.\" There was a pause, then Lieutenant Haverson replied, \"Roger, Master Chief. Locklear and I are already up here.\" The hatch of the Covenant dropship opened, and Polaski jogged out. The three of them proceeded at a brisk pace to the bridge. The Master Chief opened a private COM channel to Cortana. \"Anything else I should know?\" The channel was silent for a full ten seconds. \"I have the Covenant magnetic plasma-shaping system figured out,\" she replied. \"We\u0027ll have a limited offensive capacity when we get to Reach, if we need it. I think.\" \"And the rest of this ship is still functional?\" \"Yes,\" she replied. \"I\u0027m sorry, Chief ... these calculations are. . . tricky.\" The COM went dead. Cortana\u0027s behavior worried the Chief, but he resigned himself to trust her. What other option was there? He, the Sergeant, and Polaski halted outside the bridge; the thick blast doors were sealed. \"Lieutenant?\" he said. \"We\u0027re outside.\" The doors pulled apart. Locklear and the Lieutenant stood with their assault rifles aimed down the hall. They relaxed their stance when they identified them as friendlies. Lieutenant Haverson slung his rifle and said, \"Sorry for the warm welcome. Cortana\u0027s been picking up transient contacts all over the ship. We\u0027re going to have to deal with them sooner or later—preferably before they deal with us.\" \"Agreed,\" the Chief said. Polaski approached the Lieutenant, saluted, and gave her report on her efforts to master the Covenant dropship\u0027s controls. Locklear edged closer to the Chief and the Sergeant. \"What do you think, Sarge?\" he whispered and cast a furtive glance at Polaski. \"I mean, about her? Sure, there\u0027s that Marine-Navy thing to get over, but I can get past that. You think there\u0027s a chance that she and I? I mean—\" \"I\u0027d give you the same odds as spacing yourself and walking the rest of the way to Reach,\" the Sergeant declared. \"In your skivvies.\" \"Give me a drop capsule and I\u0027d take those odds, Sarge.\" A smile split Locklear\u0027s tanned face, and he turned to the Master Chief. \"Sure, I get it. Wouldn\u0027t be so defensive if I hadn\u0027t been close to the mark. Where there\u0027s smoke, there\u0027s fire, right?\" The Master Chief stared at Locklear and slowly shook his head. Locklear\u0027s smile faded, but not entirely. \"You guys are just jealous,\" he muttered and absentmindedly ran his finger over the scar that lined his jaw. \"That\u0027s cool. I get that all the time.\" Locklear\u0027s spirits had improved. Despite the ODST\u0027s rough edges, the Chief had seen him in combat. He didn\u0027t panic, and he had the skill and luck to survive Halo—qualities the Master Chief knew they\u0027d need if they were ever going to get back. \"Exiting Slipspace,\" Cortana announced, \"in three ... two ... one.\" According to the Master Chief\u0027s mission clock, it had only been eight minutes since Cortana had told him their ETA was nineteen minutes. Was there more to the time-dilation effect than she realized? The bridge lights dimmed, and blackness filled the arc of dis- plays along the wall. Stars winked into existence, and at three o\u0027clock blazed the warm yellow orb of Epsilon Eridani. \"We are seven hundred thousand kilometers from the system center,\" Cortana told them. \"I wanted to jump in close enough to see what\u0027s going on—but far enough away so we would have time to recharge and reenter Slipspace if there\u0027s any trouble. Picking up signals now. Covenant signals. Lots of them. Trans- lating ... stand by.\" Haverson tapped one of the screens and magnified the image. \"My God,\" he whispered. A planet appeared on the screen. He sucked in his breath as he saw a world smoldering from pole to equator. Fires raged over its surface, and a hurricane of black spiraled through the atmosphere. The Master Chief felt as if the ship had suddenly decelerated. His hands clenched. He\u0027d sent the majority of his team down there—and had con- sidered it the \"easier\" mission. He\u0027d gotten his Spartans killed, he was sure of it. Had they at least died fighting? Or were they burned from an orbiting Covenant ship, helpless? \"Are we in the right place?\" Locklear murmured. \"That\u0027s Reach?\" He removed his cap, crushed it in his hand, and whispered, \"Poor bastards.\" The other displays showed Covenant warships orbiting the planet, as well as dozens of smaller craft and one large structure that seemed to be a central docking station. \"What is this?\" the Master Chief asked, stepping closer. He tapped the center display, pushing the limits of its resolution and magnifying a portion of the surface near the midlatitudes. The image resolved into patches of green, brown, and white— different from the angry black and livid orange that dominated the view of the rest of the planet. \"Looks like they missed a spot,\" the Sergeant said. \"The Covenant don\u0027t \u0027miss\u0027 anything when they glass a planet,\" the Master Chief replied. \"We\u0027ve seen them do it a thousand times. This is no accident.\" He turned to Lieutenant Haver-son. \"We should get closer and see what this is, sir.\" \"Master Chief,\" Haverson said softly and held up his hands. \"I sympathize with your need to know with absolute certainty what happened to your fellow Spartans, but this is...\" He gestured to the planet and then frowned as he scrutinized the undamaged part of Reach. \"Indeed,\" he murmured. \"This does warrant a closer look... provided we can get away with it.\" The Lieutenant pulled the magnification back and refocused the display on the upper atmosphere. A hundred Covenant ships popped into view. \"There are several smaller vessels circling over that spot. Forget what I just said,\" Haverson whispered. \"If the Covenant are so interested in this region, then we should be as well—as long as our cover holds. Cortana, take us in closer.\" \"Yes, Lieutenant,\" Cortana replied. The Covenant flagship smoothly accelerated insystem. \"They\u0027re hailing us,\" Cortana said. \"Preparing the proper counter-response.\" John counted the ships on the display. There were hundreds— most no larger than a Covenant dropship, but there were at least a dozen cruisers and two of the titanic carriers that each carried three squadrons of Seraph fighter craft. There was more than enough firepower to turn their captured flagship into molten slag. Many of the smaller ships herded debris from the battle into one spot over Reach—a floating junkyard of UNSC and Cove- nant ships. \"You see this?\" The Master Chief pointed to the field of floating debris. The Lieutenant stared at it. \"It\u0027s almost as if they planned to stay here for a while—they\u0027re cleaning house.\" \"We\u0027re in,\" Cortana announced. \"The fleet is curious why a Covenant flagship is here, but not suspicious enough to question our authority. The translation is tricky. But apparently from the string of honorifics attached to their responses there\u0027s supposed to be someone of extreme high rank commanding this ship, someone they referred to, among other things, as the \u0027Guardian of the Luminous Key.\u0027 \" \"Damn silly name,\" muttered Sergeant Johnson. \"Can you tell what they\u0027re doing down there, Cortana?\" the Lieutenant asked. \"Not yet,\" she replied. \"Their language doesn\u0027t translate in a literal manner, and each word has multiple meanings. There\u0027s something they consider holy—there are ten times as many reli- gious allusions than in their typical communiques. Hang on . . . picking up a new signal. Weaker than the others. Not on a Cove- nant frequency. It\u0027s the UNSC E-band.\" Lieutenant Haverson licked his lips. \"Play it,\" he said. A message beeped through the speakers, six tones, then a two-second pause; it repeated. The Master Chief stiffened. \"That\u0027s it,\" Cortana said. \"Just those six notes over and over. It originates here.\" A tiny NAV triangle appeared on the edge of the intact region on the planet\u0027s surface. \"It\u0027s not Morse code,\" Polaski said. \"Not any code I\u0027ve heard of. Maybe it\u0027s a test signal? Something automated, like an air-traffic repeater relay, maybe?\" \"It\u0027s not automated,\" the Master Chief said. \"Everyone gear up and get ready. We\u0027re going down there. There are Spartans down there. And they\u0027re still alive.\" He whispered so softly that only he and Cortana heard: \"Oly Oly Oxen Free.\" CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 1002 hours, July 14,2523 (Military Calendar)\\Epsilon Eridani system, planet Reach, Spartan training exercise. Twenty-nine years ago. John crawled forward and peered over the edge of the rise. A lush, green valley stretched out below him. In the distance, the silvery reflections of the Big Horn River twisted through the thick forest. Aside from a flock of birds that wheeled overhead, there was no activity below. He inched back to a blackened, hol- low tree stump and crawled inside. Fred and Linda sat inside the hollowed-out cedar stump. It muffled their conversations and insulated them from the sol- diers\u0027 thermal goggles. \"It\u0027s all clear for now,\" he whispered. A moment later Sam, Kelly, and Fhajad appeared, ghostlike, from their camouflaged positions nearby. They crouched outside the cedar stump and watched for patrols. From a distance they looked like soldiers on field maneuvers. Each was tall, fit, and agile, and looked to be in their late teens or early twenties. Closer observation told a different story. Each Spartan was no more than twelve years old. \"Weapons check,\" John told Fred and Linda. \"We can\u0027t afford any mistakes on this one, especially not with the rifles.\" Linda and Fred disassembled and inspected their SRS99C-S2 sniper rifles—which they\u0027d liberated from a pair of Tango Com- pany shooters who\u0027d been sent to hunt them down two days ago. If the soldiers of Tango Company didn\u0027t capture them and beat them into unconsciousness—this would be fun. John checked his pistol. CPO Mendez had issued the weapon. It used compressed air to fire a narq-dart. The effective range was twenty meters, and on impact it could drop a rhino in its tracks. Twenty meters wouldn\u0027t cut it for this mission, though, so Fhajad had modified the 114mm APFSDS rounds from the sniper rifles, removed their deadly armor-piercing tips, and re- placed them with narq-dart capsules.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-first-strike-halo-3/page-21.html","bookId":1635,"book":{"id":1635,"title":"Halo: First Strike (Halo #3)","description":"Storyline: Halo: First Strike (Halo #3) The Human-Covenant war rages on as the alien juggernaut sweeps inexorably toward its final goal: destruction of all human life!
