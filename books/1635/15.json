{"id":97113,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"\"The Spartans,\" Hood whispered. \"Doctor Halsey. Whit-comb. We lost too many good people on Reach. Not to mention dozens of ships.\" He pursed his lips into a razor-thin line. \"We should send a small recon force to see what\u0027s left,\" General Strauss suggested. \"Not wise, sir,\" Ackerson replied. \"We must pull back and reinforce the Inner Colonies and Earth. The new orbital platforms won\u0027t be online for another ten days. Until then, our defense pos- ture will be far too weak. We\u0027ll need every ship we\u0027ve got.\" \"Hmm,\" Admiral Hood said. He placed both thumbs under his chin as he considered both positions. \"Sir,\" Wagner said. \"There is one additional item not covered in my report. It didn\u0027t seem exceptionally important at the time, but if you\u0027re debating a recon mission, I thought it might be pertinent.\" \"Just spit it out,\" General Strauss said. Wagner swallowed and resisted the urge to meet Ackerson\u0027s eyes. \"When the Covenant destroys a planet, they typically move their large warships closer and blanket the world with a series of crisscrossing orbits to ensure that every square millimeter of the surface is covered with plasma bombardments.\" \"I\u0027m painfully aware of Covenant bombardment doctrine, Lieutenant,\" Hood growled. \"What of it?\" \"As I indicated, they started at the poles, but took in only a few ships. They were spread thin along the equatorial latitudes, and no additional ships were inbound. In fact, a large number of Covenant ships abandoned the system, in pursuit of the Pillar of Autumn?\u0027 Ackerson waved his hand dismissively. \"Reach is glassed, Lieutenant. If you had stayed to watch the whole show, they would have burned you down, too.\" \"Yes, sir,\" Wagner replied. \"If, however, there is a recon mission, I would like to volunteer for the duty.\" Ackerson got up and strode to Wagner. He stood a centimeter from his face, and their eyes locked. Ackerson\u0027s gaze was full of poison. Wagner did his best not to recoil, but he couldn\u0027t help it. One look and he knew this man wanted him dead—for whatever reason: that he had heard of Ackerson\u0027s alternative program to the SPARTAN-IIs, that he didn\u0027t want trouble over Reach. . . or maybe, as Lysithea had warned him, that he was just looking for someone\u0027s head to impale on a pike. \"Are you deaf, Lieutenant?\" Ackerson asked with mock con- cern. \"Some kind of hearing loss due to combat action?\" \"No, sir.\" \"Well, when you push the limits of Slipspace in those little Prowlers, you risk all kinds of radiation damage. Or maybe the trauma of seeing Reach destroyed shook you. Whatever your problem, when you leave here you are to visit the infirmary. They are to give you a clean bill of health before you return to active duty.\" He shrugged. \"There must be something wrong with you, Lieutenant, because you do not seem to understand me even though my words are crystal clear.\" \"Sir.\" \"Let\u0027s try this, then. We are not wasting a single UNSC ship to confirm what we have already seen a dozen times before: Reach is gone.\" He inched closer to Wagner. \"Everything on it is blasted to bits, burned, glassed over, and vaporized. Everyone on Reach is dead.\" He jabbed a finger into Wagner\u0027s chest for emphasis. \"Dead. Dead. Dead.\" SECTION 2 DEFENSE OF CASTLE BASE CHAPTER TWELVE 0744 hours, August 30,2552 (Military Calendar)\\Epsilon Eridani system, Longhorn Valley, planet Reach. Five days ago. Steamy clouds parted like a drawn curtain; a fireball one hun- dred meters across roared over Fred and Kelly\u0027s position. Fred traced the line of flames back through the sky and spotted the faint outlines of dozens of Covenant warships in low orbit. Fred\u0027s Banshee skimmed over the treetops, down the mountain- side. He pushed the craft to its maximum speed. Kelly followed, and they swooped into a valley and up onto the zigzagging ridge-line where Joshua had first spotted the Covenant invasion force. He put aside thoughts of his fallen comrade. He had to focus on keeping his remaining team members alive. Fred called up the mapping system on his heads-up display. A blue NAV marker, nestled in the crux of topological lines, identi- fied their fallback position: ONI Section Three\u0027s secure-and-secret research facility buried under Menachite Mountain. Two decades ago it had been a titanium mine, and then the abandoned tunnels were used as storage until Section Three had taken over the mountain for their own purposes. \"We\u0027ll need to find a safe route through—\" A hail of purple-white crystalline shards hissed through the air, arcing up from the forest beneath them. Each shard looked like the projectile fired by a Covenant needier—but far larger. The shard that slashed past Fred\u0027s cockpit was the size of his forearm. Kelly dodged one projectile, which exploded in midair. Needle-like fragments bounced from the Banshee\u0027s fuselage. One tiny secondary fragment impaled Fred\u0027s Banshee and detonated. The port canard of his flier deformed from the explo- sion, and the craft wobbled. \"Down!\" he shouted, but Kelly was already a dozen meters below him and plummeting to a distant dry riverbed. He fol- lowed, trailing smoke. Fred confirmed his position and guided his wounded Banshee onto a course that followed the flash-dried riverbed below. The path wound through the forest, and sinewed close to Menachite Mountain. With luck, they could ditch the Banshees and make a short run to the ONI facility. Overhead, tangerine borealis pulsed from the north. Sheets of silver crackled across the sky, and the black clouds boiled, lit by the raging fires beneath them. They piled into thunderheads and spat lightning. The massive warships that had been overhead moments ago ac- celerated back into the upper atmosphere. Their engines screamed and left blistering wakes across the swollen sky. For a split second panic seized Fred\u0027s throat. Then his training kicked in and his mind turned cold and metallic, and filtered through every fact he had on Covenant plasma bombardments. He had to think or die. So he thought. Something didn\u0027t fit. Covenant plasma bombardment had al- ways proceeded in an orderly crisscrossing pattern across a planet until every square centimeter of the surface was glass and cinder. The ships above hadn\u0027t finished their work here. He risked a glance to the left and right. One hundred thousand hectares of forest—the same forest that Fred and his fellow Spartans had trained in since childhood—was being devoured by walls of flame. Coils of heat and thick black smoke spiraled into the sky. A wave passed over Fred and Kelly—he couldn\u0027t see it, but he felt it: A thousand ants had gotten into his armor and bitten him. Static fuzzed his display, and then vanished with apop. His shields dropped to zero and then slowly started to recharge. The grav pods on their fliers flickered and sputtered. \"EMP,\" Kelly shouted over the COM. \"Or some plasma effect.\" \"Hard landing,\" Fred ordered. Kelly made an unhappy sound over the COM and snapped it off. They plummeted out of the sky, gliding with what little aero- dynamics and power remained in their Banshees. Fred nosed his craft over the steaming rocks of the dry riverbed. He picked a path between boulders and jagged granite fangs, pointed toward a ribbon of gravel. There was just one problem: A pair of these rocks were slightly darker than the others . .. and they moved. The creatures were huge and heavily armored and moved with slow, deliberate precision. Each held a massive metal plate like a shield. Fred hit the COM and yelled, \"Heads up! Covenant Hunters dead ahead!\" There was no time to evade the new threat. The nearest Hunter wheeled to face them, and the array of sen- sory pins along its back flared, anemone-like. The hulking crea- ture raised its main weapon—a powerful fuel rod gun, mounted on its arm—at Fred. The barrel pulsed green. The Hunter fired. Fred killed the power, and his Banshee dropped ten meters. There was a flash as the orb of destructive energy split the air where his flier had been a second before. The Banshee hit the ground, skidding through fist-sized rocks. The battered craft flipped and tossed him to the ground. The Banshee rolled end over end and crashed into the Hunter. The massive alien brought up its thick, metal shield and shrugged off the wreckage as if it were cardboard. The fuel rod gun began to charge again. Fred winced and rolled to his feet, ignoring the new pain the crash landing had caused. He needed a weapon. Pain would have to wait. The Hunter lumbered toward him, then dropped into a crouch and charged ahead at terrifying speed. There was a crackle of static on his COM frequency, and Fred heard one word: \"Duck!\" He threw himself onto the ground and rolled to the side. Kelly\u0027s riderless flier soared over him and collided with the Hunter at full speed. The Banshee exploded and showered the area with glittering metal fragments. The Hunter reeled as fire washed across its armor. It moved in slow, confused circles. Fred could see the bright orange smears of the Hunter\u0027s blood staining the rocks. Kelly landed on her feet next to Fred. She readied a captured plasma grenade and hurled it straight toward the second Hunter\u0027s huge gun. It lodged in the barrel of the weapon and detonated. Tendrils of energy covered the Hunter. The gun crackled and belched smoke. Fred got to his feet. \"Run!\" They weren\u0027t going to engage a Hunter in hand-to-hand com- bat. They might lose—they might win, but in the meantime the rest of the Covenant ground forces would catch up to them. They sprinted toward a tiny patch of forest ahead, perhaps the last trees standing on Reach. The Hunter, confused with its de- stroyed weapon—and its flame-wreathed partner—hesitated, not sure what to do. \"Didn\u0027t you see while we were airborne?\" Kelly said, concern tightening her voice. \"There\u0027s about half the entire Covenant assault force just ahead.\" \"Ground troops?\" Fred said, boosting his speed to a full sprint. \"How far?\" \"Haifa klick.\" That didn\u0027t make sense, either. Why have forces groundside when you were destroying the planet from orbit? \"Something\u0027s not right,\" he told her. \"Let\u0027s see what they\u0027re up to.\" Kelly\u0027s acknowledgment light winked red. \"They\u0027re between us and the fallback point,\" Fred told her. \"We have to.\" They entered the stand of trees, paused, and looked back. The Hunter shambled after them, but it was a futile pursuit. Despite their occasional bursts of speed, the Hunters were too slow. They were caught between Covenant forces on the ground and those in the air, and neither Fred nor Kelly voiced the one question foremost on their minds: Was there even a fallback po- sition left? Or had the Covenant between them and the rest of their team found and destroyed them? The COM crackled.\"—is Gamma Team, Alpha. Come in.\" Fred replied, \"Gamma, this is Alpha. Go ahead.\" There was a roar of static. \"Whitcomb . . . too many. Got— you read?\" \"Gamma,\" Fred shouted. \"The fallback is hot. Repeat hot! Acknowledge.\" There was only static. \"I hope they heard,\" he told Kelly. \"Red-21 can take care of his team. Don\u0027t worry.\" She crept forward and waved him to follow. \"Take a look at this.\" Fred glanced over his shoulder. No Hunter, and nothing on his motion detector. He followed Kelly, and parted a wall of black- berry brambles. Parked in a clearing were Covenant vehicles, lined in three rows of four: mortar tanks. The tanks had two wide lateral fins, beneath which were armored antigrav pods. They were extremely stable and fired the Covenant\u0027s most powerful ground weapon: the energy mortar. Fred had seen them in ac- tion; they fired an encapsulated blob of plasma that obliterated everything within twenty meters of impact. Titanium battle plate, concrete, or flesh—it all vaporized. Marines called these tanks \"Wraiths\" because you usually got one look at them before they made you one. There were a handful of Grunts milling about the tanks, as well as dozens of the floating Covenant Engineers. The Engi- neers swarmed over and under the machinery. Most interesting to Fred, the vehicles\u0027 hatches were open. \"I can\u0027t think of a better disguise,\" Kelly whispered, \"than five tons of Covenant armor.\" She started forward. Fred set his hand on her arm, holding her back. \"Wait. Think it through. There are two possibilities. First, if the Covenant have found the fallback position, we go in guns blazing and carve a path for Delta Team to get out.\" She nodded. \"The other possibility?\" \"They don\u0027t know that Delta Team is holed up under the mountain. Then—\" Fred hesitated. \"Then we have to draw them away.\" Kelly considered this, then said, \"I was afraid you were going to say that.\" She gave the dirt a tiny kick. \"But you\u0027re right.\" A blip appeared on their motion trackers, directly on their six. The contact was large and moving steadily toward them. The ERIC NYLUNO 113 Hunter must have made up its mind—come to find them and stomp them into the ground. \"Move,\" Fred whispered. They crossed the field, quickly and silently, and the Grunts never saw them. Fred and Kelly reached the smooth-surfaced Wraith tanks. He gave Kelly a go signal, and she sprang into the nearest open hatch. A moment later Fred inched ahead to the next tank and eased inside. He sealed the hatch behind him. This was one of the most desperate and stupid decisions he had ever made. How were they going to take on an entire Cove- nant invasion force with a pair of tanks—especially tanks they hadn\u0027t a clue how to operate? \"Red-One,\" Kelly said over the COM. \"Ready when you are.\" Fred examined the dim interior. Directly ahead was a seat, constructed with the same mottled purple metal as the Banshees. Fred settled his bulk onto it. It was too high; he had to stand in a half crouch. Holographic control surfaces and displays sprang into the air before him and showed a 360-degree view. Through the armored shell he felt the rumble and roar of Kelly\u0027s tank starting.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-first-strike-halo-3/page-15.html","bookId":1635,"book":{"id":1635,"title":"Halo: First Strike (Halo #3)","description":"Storyline: Halo: First Strike (Halo #3) The Human-Covenant war rages on as the alien juggernaut sweeps inexorably toward its final goal: destruction of all human life!
