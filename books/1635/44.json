Override in progress. System lockdo—\" The COM went dead. A hundred meters away, beyond the cracked window, the atmosphere turned white for a split second then cleared. Spaced every twenty meters along the bay walls, the air lock doors were opening. Beyond, stars shone upon velvet black. Fred and Will\u0027s Banshees appeared off John\u0027s starboard ca- nard. John pointed and together they dived, accelerating toward a bull\u0027s-eye pattern of cracks on the translucent portion of the wall. That web of fissures spread: fingers that stretched and split along the length of the window... slowed and stopped. John fired the Banshee\u0027s plasma cannons. Fred opened fire as well, and four blobs of plasma splashed across the glassy surface fifty meters away. The window flexed, crackled, tiny flakes popped off. . . but the translucent material remained stubbornly intact. John was thirty meters from the surface—he\u0027d have to veer off now, or impact upon it. He gritted his teeth and braced himself. Ten meters. The window\u0027s smooth surface flashed into a jigsaw mosaic. The squealing of glass over glass filled the air. It shattered. The entire length crumbled and instantly blasted into the vacuum of space—swept out by the pressurized atmosphere fill- ing the interior of the station. John tried to maneuver the Banshee. He bounced into the repair bay, rolled the craft over and upright—fell off, tumbled though the air lock . . . and drifted away into the darkness of space. He flailed his limbs in the zero gravity, and the tether on his belt snapped taut. He recoiled back toward the Banshee. Linda held on with one hand and held out the other to him. He climbed back aboard and tapped the thrusters to stabilize their pitch and yaw. Behind them the station vented gas as well as the bodies of Covenant Engineers, Grunts, Jackals, and Elites. Clouds of metal junk bled from the ruptures. Tendrils of steam flash froze into glittering ice crystals. The Covenant fleet moved as well—some cruisers closed with the station, others moved farther away. There were five hun- dred alien warships without leadership from their command-and-control center, and they reminded John of motes of dust in a sunbeam—silently floating in every direction. John spotted a dropship drifting a kilometer ahead, dead in space. He clicked his COM once and dropped a NAV marker onto a Covenant craft. Fred and Will\u0027s acknowledgment lights winked on. John pulsed the Banshee\u0027s engines once and let its inertia carry them to the dropship. He hoped the rest of the Covenant Fleet was trying to figure out what had just happened... and not paying any attention to one more piece of debris floating in space. The Banshees gently impacted onto the tumbling dropship. John grasped the hull, and Linda scrabbled over him, opened the port access hatch, and entered. Fred and Will drifted closer, and John helped them aboard. He hesitated and took another look at the Covenant fleet. Hundred of ships without control. But how long would that last? Even if the station\u0027s reactors chained and blew... the Covenant still had enough force to destroy Earth\u0027s defenses and burn it to a cinder. All they had done was buy a little time: as long as it took for someone to take charge of the Covenant fleet. That wasn\u0027t enough, but John wasn\u0027t sure what else to do. He crawled to the hatch, entered the ship, and sealed it be- hind him. Linda stood at the pilot\u0027s console while Fred stood beside her manning the ops station. An engine schematic appeared in front of Linda, and power pulsed through its plasma coils. The interior lights dimly glowed. \"Where to, Chief?\" Linda asked. \"Away,\" John said and looked at the system NAV display. He pointed to the tiny moon orbiting the nearby planet. \"Get us into the moon\u0027s shadow. But slow. Try not to attract any attention.\" His countdown timer read 5:12. They might still have time. \"Roger,\" Linda said. The dropship spun about and gently moved away from the sta- tion, almost imperceptibly accelerating toward the tiny moon covered with black and silver pockmarks. Fred hunched over his console. Thick spiky lines representing the Covenant F- through K-bands fluxed and flickered on his screen. \"Covenant COM channels are jammed,\" he reported. \"Communiques and queries to and from every ship in the fleet wondering what the hell is going on. And the station\u0027s COM channels are all full of those copied Cortanas ... and she\u0027s just repeating different system error codes.\" \"What\u0027s this?\" John asked, leaning over Fred\u0027s shoulder. He pointed to one COM band with only a single spike. Fred looked at the Covenant calligraphy for a long moment, and then inhaled sharply. \"If the translation software is working right,\" he whispered, \"that\u0027s the E-band... it\u0027s one of ours.\" Fred snapped on the external speakers. Six tones beeped, stopped, and then repeated. \"Oly Oly Oxen Free,\" John breathed. \"Send the countersign, Fred.\" \"Aye, Chief. Sending now.\" Who could have sent that signal? There was no other living Spartan in this system. Unless it was Dr. Halsey and Kelly. Had they somehow tracked them? \"It\u0027s about time you showed up.\" The drawling voice of Admiral Whitcomb was loud and clear over the COM. \"Switch to en- cryption scheme \u0027Rainbow.\u0027 \" John nodded to Fred, who ran a shunt from the Covenant COM into the data port in the back of his helmet. \"Decryption online,\" Fred reported. \"Admiral,\" John said. \"With all due respect, sir, why are you here?\" \"Lieutenant Haverson suggested we drop out of Slipspace on the edge of this system—hide in the Oort cloud and gather a little intel.\" The Admiral sighed. \"Well, I took one look and figured that even if you took out that station... hell, son, there\u0027d still be a couple of hundred Covenant ships within spittin\u0027 distance of Earth. Me getting there and warning them about it wouldn\u0027t make a lick of difference. So I\u0027m going to do something about it here and now. You\u0027ve done your part, Chief. Leave the rest to me.\" There was a pause, then the Admiral asked in a low, serious tone, \"You did get it done, didn\u0027t you, son? You got that station rigged to blow?\" \"Yes, sir.\" John linked his mission timer to the COM. \"Four minutes thirty-two seconds and counting.\" \"Perfect, Master Chief. Bring \u0027em on back to the barn. Stay on your heading. Your instincts are dead on. We\u0027re on the far side of the moon and are waiting for you.\" John motioned to Linda to increase their velocity. She pushed the acceleration stripe to three quarters power. \"Waiting, sir?\" \"Whitcomb over and out.\" The COM went dead. John looked to Will, Fred, and Linda, and they all shrugged. He pushed the acceleration stripe to full velocity, and the dropship entered a high orbit around the splotchy moon, arcing around to the far side, where the battered Gettysburg waited for them. But only the Gettysburg. \"Where\u0027s Ascendant Justice?\" John whispered. CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX 1825 hours, September 13,2552 (revised date, Military Calendar)\\Aboard UNSC vessel Gettysburg, near Covenant battle station Unyielding Hierophant. The Master Chief and Blue Team stepped off the lift and onto the bridge of the Gettysburg. \"Sir—\" John started to salute Admiral Whitcomb, but neither the Admiral nor Lieutenant Haverson was there. The only two on the bridge were Sergeant Johnson, who stared at the forward viewscreens, and Cortana, whose holographic fig- ure burned bright blue and streamed with code symbols and mathematics beyond John\u0027s comprehension. Sergeant Johnson turned toward them. He looked the Spar- tans over and frowned, noting that not all of them had returned. \"I\u0027m not sure what that thing is.\" The Sergeant nodded to view-screen one, centered on the Covenant command-and-control station. \"Don\u0027t look like any \u0027uneven elephant\u0027 to me—more like two squid kissing. Whatever it is, damned glad it\u0027s going to blow up. Nice job—almost as good as if we sent in the Marines.\" One corner of his mouth quirked into a smile. \"Where\u0027s the Admiral?\" the Master Chief asked. \"And Lieutenant Haverson?\" The Sergeant\u0027s half smile vanished, and his eyes darkened. He moved to Weapons Station One. \"I\u0027ll show you. A Clarion spy drone is nearly in position.\" The center viewscreen fuzzed with static and then resolved to show the Ascendant Justice moving out of the shadow of the moon. The once formidable Covenant flagship was a wreck; its hull was breached in a dozen places, its skeletal frame exposed, and only a handful of plasma conduits flickered with life. \"I don\u0027t understand,\" the Chief said. He stepped closer to Cortana\u0027s hologram. Being near the real Cortana—not one of her fragmented copies—reassured him that everything was un- der control. \"What\u0027s going on?\" \"Stand by, Chief,\" she replied. \"I\u0027m attempting to attune Ascendant Justice\u0027s Slipspace drive to the Gettysburg\u0027s mass and profile.\" \"That\u0027s what we were up to while you were off sight-seeing,\" the Sergeant told him. \"We pulled the Slipspace matrix out of our piggybacked ship and slapped it into the Gettysburg.\" John wheeled and faced the viewscreens. Ascendant Justice couldn\u0027t jump? Then why was it headed straight toward the Covenant fleet? A decoy? He glanced at the countdown timer: 2:09 left. \"Not a decoy,\" he whispered,\"... a lure. Sergeant, get a signal to Ascendant Justice. Bounce it off that spy drone if you have to.\" \"Roger, Chief,\" Sergeant Johnson said and tapped in com- mands. An error warning blared. He shook his head, puzzled, and tried again, carefully retyping. \"Linda, take the NAV station. Fred, you\u0027re on Ops. Will, give the Sergeant a hand at Weapons One.\" Blue Team jumped to their assigned stations. Will edged the Sergeant aside and quickly tapped three but- tons. \"COM patch established,\" he reported. \"On viewscreen two.\" The bridge of Ascendant Justice appeared on screen. Lieu- tenant Haverson and Admiral Whitcomb stood on the central raised dais, adjusting the holographic controls. Behind them, the wall displays showed Covenant ships closing on their position. Admiral Whitcomb smiled. \"Glad to see you made it safely aboard, son.\" \"Sir, that fleet will destroy you before you can fire a single salvo.\" \"I don\u0027t think so, Master Chief,\" he replied and tapped the holographic display. A slim blue crystalline shard appeared— an exact copy of the alien artifact they found on Reach. \"I\u0027m sending this image to every ship in the system and letting them know it\u0027s theirs for the taking ... if they dare to board this ship and face Earth\u0027s best warriors.\" He laughed. \"I think that\u0027ll appeal to those Elites and their overinflated sense of honor.\" John nodded. \"Yes, sir. It will.\" He looked at the countdown timer: 1:42. The Covenant fleet turned and moved toward the incoming Ascendant Justice. A cloud of cruisers and carriers. Hundreds of them. Impossible odds. \"Fire turret four, Lieutenant,\" the Admiral ordered. \"Firing!\" Haverson replied, his face set in grim determination. A lance of plasma discharged, arced, and impacted upon the nose of the nearest carrier. The energy splashed over their shields and dissipated. \"Turret five, Lieutenant. Take them down.\" \"Firing five, sir,\" Haverson said. A second plasma bolt followed the first. It blasted the carrier\u0027s weakened shields and melted armor and hull, exploding through the foredecks. The ship rolled and crashed into a cruiser that had come too close. \"Nice shooting, Lieutenant,\" the Admiral murmured. The Covenant fleet responded with a blinding volley of laser fire. Pinpoints of energy concentrated on Ascendant Justice\u0027s aft decks, boiled armor off in thick layers—sheared through to the other side, severing its engines. The Admiral smiled. \"A sound tactical response. Good thing they don\u0027t know we\u0027re just using that slingshot around the moon and our inertia to do the rest of the job.\" He glanced at the displays and the station growing larger on them. \"Hang on, Lieu- tenant. Brace for impact.\" Ascendant Justice drifted closer to the station. It crashed into the central ring, crushing the structure, and continued forward, dimpling the hull of the pinched center sec- tion ... and finally ground to a halt with its nose impaled within the Unyielding Hierophant. The center viewscreen on the bridge of the Gettysburg shat- tered into static and then slowly resolved. The wavering image of Admiral Whitcomb pulled himself upright. A gash from his temple to the corner of his mouth wept blood. Lieutenant Haver- son groggily got to his feet as well, his arm held at an odd angle, broken. \"Systemwide transmission,\" Admiral Whitcomb barked to Haverson. \"Aye, sir,\" Haverson said and clumsily adjusted the COM. \"Come on, mighty Covenant warriors,\" the Admiral shouted. \"We\u0027re here in the middle of your fleet with your \u0027holy of holies.\u0027 \" He flicked his ringer at the holographic shard, and it pinged as if actually struck. \"Come and get it!\" He laughed again. Hundreds of Covenant ships moved toward them. Grapple lines and grav beams attached to the broken hull of the Ascen- dant Justice. A thousand dropships and Elites in thrust packs filled the space around the flagship. The Master Chief watched the countdown timer: 0:27. Along the ten-kilometer dorsal bulb of the space station, patches warmed to a dull red, the heat from the overloading reac- tors becoming outwardly visible. \"Move us back, Linda,\" John said. \"Keep us in the moon\u0027s shadow. Use as much power as we can spare.\" \"Aye, Chief,\" Linda replied. \"Forward thrusters answering one third reverse power. Course one-eight-zero.\" \"Cortana,\" he asked, \"Slipspace generator status?\" \"Almost ready, Chief,\" Cortana said. She bit her lower lip in concentration. \"Capacitor charge at eighty percent. Adjusting final calculations. Stand by.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-first-strike-halo-3/page-44.html","bookId":1635,"book":{"id":1635,"title":"Halo: First Strike (Halo #3)","description":"Storyline: Halo: First Strike (Halo #3) The Human-Covenant war rages on as the alien juggernaut sweeps inexorably toward its final goal: destruction of all human life!
