His team, however, knew the risks and knew the payoff for their sacrifice. It was as good a final fate as any soldier could ask for.\n He marched to the other hatch on the dropship and boarded the craft. There was one last detail to take care of with Lieu- tenant Haverson. John moved past Sergeant Johnson who, ob- scured by a shower of sparks, welded the last supporting I-beam in place.\n The Lieutenant sat in the cockpit checking the automated rou- tines that Cortana had uploaded into the system. These would generate the proper coded responses to Covenant queries. They had also changed the dropship\u0027s registry tag so the Covenant would not recognize this ship as belonging to the now renegade Ascendant Justice.\n \"Lieutenant,\" the Master Chief said. \"Forgive the interruption.\"\n Haverson looked up and slicked the sweat-drenched hair from his face. \"What can I do for you, Chief?\"\n The Master Chief eased into the copilot\u0027s seat. \"Dr. Halsey gave me something to pass on to ONI Section Three: her analysis on the Flood.\"\n Haverson\u0027s eyebrows shot up.\n He opened his belt compartment .. . and hesitated. Which data crystal? The one only containing Dr. Halsey\u0027s Flood analysis and possible inoculation? Or the one containing the source files for her conclusions, the one she said would kill Sergeant Johnson?\n While John felt justified in gambling his life and the lives of the other Spartans, that was his choice as their commander to make. That wasn\u0027t the case for the Sergeant.\n It was a biological fluke that had spared the Sergeant from the Flood. A one-in-a-billion shot, the doctor had said. But it was a billion-to-one shot that he could save billions of lives. So the mathematics of the situation were almost even.\n What had Dr. Halsey said about saving every person, no mat- ter what the cost?\n No—John had sworn an oath to protect all of humanity. His duty was clear. He reached for the crystal containing the com- plete files and handed it to Lieutenant Haverson. \"She said it would help fight the Flood, sir. I\u0027m not exactly sure what she meant.\"\n \"We\u0027ll see, Chief. Thank you.\" Haverson took the crystal and peered into his depths. He shrugged. \"With Doctor Halsey, who can tell?\"\n The COM channel clicked, and Cortana announced, \"Ten minutes until we reach the drop zone. Make final preparations to launch Blue Team. You\u0027ll only get one shot at this.\"\n \"Roger that, Cortana,\" the Chief replied. \"Spartans, on deck!\"\n Haverson tentatively extended his hand. \"I guess this is it, Chief.\"\n The Chief gently shook the Lieutenant\u0027s hand. \"Good luck, sir.\"\n John moved back though the dropship—almost running over Sergeant Johnson, who was dragging the arc welder down the gangway.\n \"Allow me, Sergeant.\" John grasped the two-hundred-kilogram machine and lifted it with one hand.\n The Master Chief exited the dropship, and he and the other Spartans assembled outside. He stowed the arc welder and took his position at the head of the Spartan formation.\n Admiral Whitcomb looked them over once and then said, \"I\u0027d wish you luck, Master Chief, but you Spartans seem to make your own luck. So let me just say I\u0027ll see you all when this is over.\"\n He saluted them and they returned the salute.\n \"Just one last order,\" the Admiral said.\n \"Sir?\"\n \"Give\u0027em hell.\"\n CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO\n 0530 hours, September 13,2552 (revised date, Military Calendar)\\Aboard captured Covenant dropship, in Slipspace.\n The dropship rolled, inverted, and spun out of control. It tum- bled and pitched, and one of the I-beams solidly welded to the hull bucked and snapped.\n The Spartans of Blue Team were strapped to the hull in quick-release harnesses. No one, however, gave any thought to the red quick-release button in the center of their chests. They were all hanging on for their lives.\n The forward monitor was black because there was nothing for them to see in Slipspace. The only light inside the dropship came from chemical light sticks activated and tossed inside before they departed. Those plastic sticks had cracked, and their lumi- nous contents had balled into a million microscopic blobs in the zero gee.\n Although the hydrostatic gel inside his MJOLNIR armor had been pressurized to its maximum safe value, John\u0027s bones still felt as if they were being shaken apart.\n This violent ride started when they had cleared Ascendant Justice\u0027s launch bay and entered the inky void of Slipspace. This \"normal\" Slipspace was nothing like John had experienced before. Without the smoothing effect of Dr. Halsey\u0027s alien crystal—this ride was a thousand times worse.\n Radiation levels spiked and dipped... but so far the dosages getting into the lead-lined dropship were survivable.\n \"Now I know,\" Linda said, \"why only big ships travel through Slipspace.\"\n \"You know those SS probes?\" Fred asked. \"They\u0027re almost solid Titanium-A.\"\n The Master Chief checked his team\u0027s biosigns: erratic but still within normal operational parameters. Grace\u0027s heart skipped a beat or two, but then returned to a normal strong rhythm. No broken bones or signs of internal bleeding yet, either. It was also a good sign that Blue Team were reasonably calm about their dire situation. The Chief knew it was all they could do until they cleared the Slipspace field generated by Ascendant Justice.\n He ran a diagnostic on his MJOLNIR shields. They still re- charged faster than they were drained by the ambient radiation that stormed invisibly around them. He wished the real Cortana were with him. She would have said something to distract him.\n \"Status?\" John asked.\n Four blue acknowledgment lights winked on, and four Spar- tans gave him thumbs-up signals.\n Fred chimed in, \"This isn\u0027t so bad. The last insertion I made, we hit the ground before the dropship. Now, that was a rough ride. We were—\"\n The dropship lurched violently and cut off Fred\u0027s story.\n Cracks appeared along the armor welded to the port wall.\n Molten lead oozed from the rupture.\n Despite the hydrostatic gel and the padding, a jolt slammed the Master Chief\u0027s head against the front of his helmet with force enough to make black stars explode in his eyes. Another jolt slammed his head into the back of his helmet. The inside of the dropship went entirely dark.\n \"Chief? Chief?\" Cortana\u0027s voice whispered through his hel- met speaker. \"Chief, respond please.\"\n John\u0027s vision came into focus. His biosigns sluggishly pulsed on his heads-up display. Beyond the display, it was completely dark. He activated his external lights and pointed his head along the interior of the dropship.\n His Spartans hung limp in their harnesses. Aside from spheres of lead that had melted under the hull armor, resolidified, and now floated like champagne bubbles in the interior of the vessel, there was no other discernible motion.\n \"We made it?\"\n \"Affirmative,\" the cloned Cortana answered. \"I\u0027m picking up a tremendous volume of Covenant COM traffic on the F- through K-bands. They\u0027ve pinged us three times already for a response, Chief. Awaiting orders.\"\n \"How can you pick up any signal inside this lead-lined hull?\"\n \"The hull is breached in many sections, Chief. The COM traffic is also unusually strong, indicating extremely close proximity of Covenant forces.\"\n \"Stand by,\" he told her. He hit the quick release on his harness and floated free. He called up Blue Team\u0027s biosigns and found them all unconscious, but alive. He grabbed a first-aid kit, in- jected them each with a mild stimulant, and released them from their safety restraints.\n \"Where are we?\" Will asked.\n The Master Chief looked instinctively to the forward moni- tors, but they were dead. \"There\u0027s only one way to find out,\" he replied. \"I\u0027ll take the portside hatch. Fred, you\u0027re on the starboard.\"\n \"Roger, Blue-One,\" Fred replied.\n The Chief rotated the manual release of the hatch and it eased open. Beyond was the velvet black of space, filled with stars that shone yellow and amber and red. He clipped a tether onto his suit and then onto the hull and leaned out the hatch.\n As Cortana had indicated, there were Covenant forces in close proximity. A cruiser glided silently past them three hundred me- ters away. All John could see was its silver-blue hull, its plasma turrets with their lateral lines aglow with fire, and the flare of its engine cones as it passed... and then John saw the rest of them.\n There were Covenant cruisers and larger carriers; there were even bigger vessels with five bulbous sections that were two kilometers stem to stern and had a dozen deadly energy projec- tors. Motes of dust swirled between the numerous ships: Seraph fighters, dropships, and tentacled Engineer pods.\n \"How many ships,\" he asked Cortana, \"are we looking at?\"\n \"Two hundred forty-seven warships,\" she replied. \"Estimation of the total population based on the sampling from your lim- ited field of vision puts that total number at more than five hundred Covenant warships.\"\n For the first time the Chief froze; his gauntlets locked onto the edge of the hatch, and his arms failed to respond. Five hundred ships? There was more firepower here than he had ever seen be- fore. This fleet would easily overwhelm any UNSC defensive force—whether or not the Admiral got through with his warning.\n Their opening salvo would be a tidal wave of plasma, and it would obliterate Earth\u0027s orbital fortresses before they could fire a shot.\n A thousand kilometers below, space rippled, parted, and seven more cruisers appeared in normal space. They maneuvered to join the rest of the pack.\n John realized he had seen this magnitude of destructive power: Halo. The ring was a weapon designed to kill all sentient life for dozens of light-years in every direction.\n And he had stopped that threat. He could stop this one, too.\n He had to.\n His plan called for the infiltration and destruction of their command-and-control station. But how would that stop this gathering offeree? It wouldn\u0027t... but it might buy Earth enough time to come up with a plan to counter this seemingly invincible armada.\n \"You said they\u0027ve pinged us three times?\" John asked Cortana.\n \"Affirmative. They\u0027ve been curious about our status, but not as much as you might expect. There\u0027s a tremendous amount of COM traffic. They\u0027re probably only interested in us as a naviga- tion hazard.\"\n \"Send a signal and explain that our engines are crippled and we\u0027ll need assistance to move. Let\u0027s see if we can get them to take us to this central station for repairs.\"\n \"Sending message now.\"\n The Master Chief piped what he was seeing to Blue Team.\n \"Time to wake up,\" he said. \"Armor and weapons check on the double.\"\n There was a pause of several seconds before Blue Team\u0027s ac- knowledgment lights pulsed in his HUD. He knew they were having the same reaction of fear, and then drawing the same con- clusion as he had about their mission. They couldn\u0027t fail: The fate of humanity lay in their hands.\n John angled his head around to take a look at the dropship.\n The majority of the dropship\u0027s hull had peeled away, and lead and titanium plates underneath showed through. Without their reinforcements, the craft would have disintegrated on the rough ride through Slipspace.\n \"Covenant C \u0026 C responding to our request,\" the copied Cor-tana informed him. \"Ferry en route to take us in for repairs.\n They were a little confused about which warship we belong to, but I simulated static to cover our ship\u0027s registration ID. They\u0027re too busy to take too close a look at us.\"\n The Master Chief returned inside the dropship. \"We\u0027re get- ting towed,\" he told Blue Team.\n Linda came up to him and made a circle in the air with her in- dex finger. John nodded and turned around so she could visually inspect his MJOLNIR suit. Computer diagnostics were fine, but his Spartans didn\u0027t take any chances with their armor. Especially not in an evacuated environment.\n \"You\u0027re good,\" she told him.\n John then returned the favor and examined her suit. Fred and Will had done an excellent job integrating the replacement parts into Linda\u0027s armor. Aside from their pristine condition, they were a perfect match.\n He patted her on the shoulder and gave her a thumbs-up to in- dicate that her armor was in working order.\n \"Ordnance load out,\" Grace said and unraveled the duffel bags they had tied to the hull. The packages had been wrapped with lead foil, layers of thermal padding, and then a layer of utility tape. \"Heavy or light?\" she asked.\n \"We go in heavy,\" John said. \"Except Linda.\"\n Linda started to object, but he explained, \"We\u0027ll need you to hang back and cover us with your sniper rifle. I want you fast and deadly. Take a close-range weapon, extra ammo, and whatever you need to keep your sniper rifle working in the field.\"\n \"Roger,\" Linda said. Her voice was cold, hard, and brittle.\n This was the voice John had heard as she reported in while snip- ing targets around the team. John sometimes found it a little too cold... but he knew this was a good sign. Linda was preparing to do what she did best: kill with a single shot.\n \"The rest of us will take whatever we can carry. Once we\u0027re in I have a feeling we won\u0027t be able to come back. If we have to, we can always lighten our load.\"\n The Chief grabbed a battle rifle and, for close use, a pair of submachine guns. He took a pair of silencers for the SMGs and hip holsters for the smaller weapons. He picked up a dozen frag grenades in their plastic ring carrier and slotted that into the left thigh section of his armor.\n He\u0027d need ammunition, a lot of it, if things got hot. So he took extra clips for the SMGs and the battle rifle and taped them onto his chest, arms, and right thigh. More clips went into a back- pack, along with two Lotus antitank mines, a few cans of C-7 ex- plosive, detonators, timers, two field first-aid kits, and a fiber-optic probe.\n While the rest of Blue Team got their gear together, John told them, \"Stay off the COM from now on.\"\n They all nodded.\n Lead lining or not, they were close to too many listening Covenant ears to take any more chances with the COM. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-first-strike-halo-3/page-40.html","bookId":1635,"book":{"id":1635,"title":"Halo: First Strike (Halo #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Halo: First Strike (Halo #3) \n The Human-Covenant war rages on as the alien juggernaut sweeps inexorably toward its final goal: destruction of all human life! \n Halo has been destroyed, and the threat it posed to sentient life, neutralized.
