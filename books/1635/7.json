John\u0027s reflexes kicked in— he grabbed a handful of the man\u0027s uniform, kicked the hatch shut, and propelled both of them against the hull. With a lightning-quick motion, he drew the newcomer\u0027s pistol and aimed it squarely at the man\u0027s forehead.\n \"You were dead,\" the Chief said. \"I saw you die. On Jenkins\u0027s mission record. The Flood got you.\"\n The black man smiled a set of perfect white teeth. \"The Flood? Hell, Chief, it\u0027ll take more than that pack of walking alien horror-show freaks to take out Sergeant A. J. Johnson.\"\n CHAPTER SIX\n 1710 hours, September 22,2552 (Military Calendar) \\ Aboard\n Longsword fighter, uncharted system, Halo debris field.\n The Master Chief held on to the ship\u0027s frame with one hand so he wouldn\u0027t float away in zero gee. With the other hand he pressed the pistol deeper into Johnson\u0027s forehead.\n The Sergeant\u0027s smile faded, but there was not a trace of fear in his dark eyes. He snorted a laugh. \"I get it: You think I\u0027m in- fected. Well, I\u0027m not. This\"—he patted his chest—\"is one hundred percent grade-A Marine... and nothin\u0027 else.\"\n The Chief eased his stance but didn\u0027t lower the gun. \"Explain how that\u0027s possible.\"\n \"They got us all right, those little mushroom-shaped infec- tious bastards,\" Johnson said. \"They ambushed me, Jenkins, and Keyes.\" He paused at the Captain\u0027s name, then shook his head and went on. \"They swarmed all over us. Jenkins and Keyes were taken... but I guess I didn\u0027t taste too good.\"\n \"The Flood doesn\u0027t \u0027taste\u0027 anything,\" Cortana interjected. \"The Infection Forms rewrite a victim\u0027s cellular structure and convert him into a Combat Form, then later a Carrier Form—an incubator for more Infection Forms. Based on what we\u0027ve seen, they cer- tainly don\u0027t just decide to pass up a victim.\"\n The Sergeant shrugged. He fished into his pocket, found the remaining stub of a chewed cigar, and stuck it in the corner of his mouth. \"Well, I\u0027ve seen different. They \u0027passed me up\u0027 like I was undercooked spinach at a turkey dinner.\"\n \"Cortana,\" the Chief asked. \"Is it possible?\"\n \"It\u0027s possible? she carefully replied. \"But it\u0027s also highly unlikely.\" She paused for two heartbeats, and then added, \"According to the readings from the Sergeant\u0027s biomonitors, his story checks out. I can\u0027t be one hundred percent positive until he\u0027s been cleared in a medical suite, but preliminary findings indi- cate that he is clean of any Flood parasitic infection. He\u0027s obvi- ously not a mindless, half-naked alien killing machine.\"\n \"All right.\" The Chief clicked the pistol\u0027s safety to \"on\" then flipped the pistol around and handed it back to the Sergeant, grip first. \"But I\u0027m having you checked inside and out the first chance we get. We can\u0027t risk letting the Flood infection spread.\"\n \"I hear you, Master Chief. Looking forward to those Navy nurses. Now—\" The Sergeant pushed off the hull and drifted toward the hatch. \"—let\u0027s get the rest of the crew on board.\" He hesitated by the cryotubes. \"I see you already picked up a few stragglers.\"\n \"They\u0027ll have to wait,\" the Chief said. \"It\u0027ll take half an hour to thaw them out without risking hypothermic shock. We don\u0027t have that much time left before we reengage the Covenant.\"\n \"Reengage,\" the Sergeant said, savoring the word. He smiled.\n \"Good. For a second I thought we were running away from a per- fectly good fight.\" The Sergeant opened the hatch to the Pelican.\n The barrel of an MA5B assault rifle extended through the opening. The Sergeant reached down and pulled it up.\n A Marine Corporal drifted though the hatch. The name stitched on his uniform read LOCKLEAR. He was tanned, shaved bald, and had a wild look in his clear blue eyes. He retrieved his gun from the Sergeant and swept the interior with the point of his weapon. \"Clear!\" he shouted back down into the Pelican.\n \"At ease, Corporal,\" the Master Chief said.\n The Corporal\u0027s eyes finally locked onto the Chief. He shook his head in disbelief. \"A Spartan,\" he muttered. \"Figures. Outta the friggin\u0027 frying pan—\"\n The Master Chief spotted the Marine\u0027s shoulder patch: the gold comet insigne of the Orbital Drop Shock Troops. The ODST, more colorfully known as \"Helljumpers,\" were notorious for their tenacity in a fight.\n Locklear must have been one of Major Silva\u0027s boys, which ex- plained the young Marine\u0027s general hostility. Silva was ODST to the bone, and during the action on Halo had been decidedly negative about the SPARTAN-IIs in general... and the Chief in particular.\n Another man gripped the edge of the hatch and pulled himself up. He had a plasma pistol strapped to his side and wore a crisp black uniform. His red hair was neatly slicked back, and his eyes took in the Chief without obvious surprise. He wore the black enameled bars of a First Lieutenant.\n \"Sir!\" The Chief snapped off a crisp salute.\n \"Adjusting burn and angle,\" Cortana announced. The Long-sword and Pelican tilted relative to the moon, Basis, on the viewscreen. \"That should give you a little more than one gee on the deck.\"\n The lieutenant settled to the floor and lazily returned the salute. \"I\u0027m Haverson,\" he said. He looked John over with interest.\n \"You are the Master Chief, SPARTAN-117.\"\n \"Yes, sir.\" The Chief was surprised. Most people, even experienced officers, had difficulty distinguishing one Spartan from another. How had this young officer so quickly identified him?\n The Chief saw the round insigne on the man\u0027s shoulder—the black and silver eagle wings over a trio of stars. Inscribed above the eagle wings were the Latin words SEMPER VIGILANS—Ever Vigilant.\n Haverson was with the Office of Naval Intelligence.\n \"Good,\" Haverson said. He glanced quickly at Locklear and Johnson. \"With you, Chief, we might have a chance.\" He reached into the hatch and pulled another person onto the Longsword.\n This last person was a woman, and she wore the flight-suit of a pilot. Her dirty blond hair was tucked into a cap. She saluted the Chief. \"Petty Warrant Officer Polaski, requesting permission to come aboard, Master Chief.\"\n \"Granted,\" he said and returned her salute.\n Stenciled onto her coveralls was a flaming fist over a red bull\u0027s-eye, the insignia of the Twenty-third Naval Air Squadron.\n Although the Chief had never met Polaski, she was from the same chalk as Captain Carol Rawley, callsign \"Foehammer.\" If Polaski was anything like Foehammer, she would be a skilled and fearless pilot.\n \"So what\u0027s the story?\" Locklear demanded. \"We got something to shoot here?\"\n \"At ease, Marine,\" the Sergeant growled. \"Use that stuffing between your ears for something besides keeping your helmet on. Notice we\u0027re not floating? Feel those gee forces? This ship is in a slingshot orbit. We\u0027re coming around the moon for another crack at the Covenant.\"\n \"That\u0027s correct,\" the Chief said.\n \"Our first priority should be to escape,\" Haverson said and his thin brows knitted in frustration, \"not to blindly engage the Covenant. We have valuable intelligence on the enemy, and on Halo. Our first priority should be to reach UNSC-controlled space.\"\n \"That was my intention, sir,\" the Chief replied. \"But neither this Longsword nor your Pelican is equipped with Shaw-Fujikawa engines. Without a jump to Slipspace, it would take years to return.\"\n Haverson sighed. \"That does limit our options, doesn\u0027t it?\"\n He turned his back to the Chief and paced, deep in thought.\n The Master Chief respected the chain of command, wnich meant that he had to obey Lieutenant Haverson. But, officer or not, the Spartan had never liked it when people turned their backs to him. And he certainly didn\u0027t like the way Haverson as- sumed he was in charge.\n The Chief had already gotten his orders, and he intended to follow them—whether or not Haverson approved.\n \"Pardon me, sir,\" the Chief said. \"I must point out that while you are the ranking officer, I am on a classified mission of the highest priority. My orders come directly from High Command.\"\n \"Meaning?\"\n \"Meaning,\" John continued, \"I have tactical command of this crew, these ships. . . and you. Sir.\"\n Haverson turned, his expression dark. The Lieutenant\u0027s mouth opened as if he were going to say something. He closed his mouth and looked the Chief over. A faint smile flickered over his thin lips. \"Of course. I am well aware of your mission, Chief. I\u0027ll do anything I can to assist.\"\n He knew about the Spartan\u0027s original mission to capture a Covenant Prophet? What was an ONI officer doing here anyway?\n \"So what\u0027s the plan?\" Locklear asked. \"Slingshot orbit—then what? We just going to talk all day, Chief?\"\n \"No,\" the Chief replied.\n He glanced at Polaski and the Sergeant. He could count on her, and though he was suspicious of exactly how Sergeant John- son had avoided falling to the Flood, he was willing to give the man the benefit of the doubt. Haverson? He wouldn\u0027t trust him, but the man knew what was at stake, and he wouldn\u0027t interfere.\n Probably. Locklear was another story, though.\n The ODST was coiled and ready to pounce . . . or come apart like an antipersonnel mine. Some men broke under pressure and wouldn\u0027t fight. Some snapped and disregarded their own and their team\u0027s safety for blind revenge. Add that to the Hell-jumper\u0027s fierce pride and one had a volatile mix. The Chief had to establish his authority over the man.\n \"Get onto the Pelican,\" the Chief told him. \"We only have a few minutes while we\u0027re on the far side of this moon. Grab anything we can use: extra weapons, ammunition, grenades. Keep linked up to my COM so you can hear the briefing.\"\n Locklear stood there, glared into the Chief\u0027s faceplate, and tensed.\n Sergeant Johnson opened his mouth, but the Chief made a subtle cutting gesture with his hand. The Sergeant kept whatever he had to say to himself.\n The Master Chief took a step closer to Locklear. \"Was my or- der unclear, Corporal?\"\n Locklear swallowed. The blue fire in his eyes dulled and he looked away. \"No.\" His body slumped and he shouldered his rifle, accepting, for now, the Master Chief\u0027s authority. \"I\u0027m on it, Master Chief.\" He went to the hatch and dropped into the Pelican.\n To say this team was mismatched for a high-risk insertion op was an understatement.\n \"So how do we get a Shaw-Fujikawa drive?\" Polaski asked.\n \"We don\u0027t,\" John replied. \"But we go after the next best thing.\" He moved to the ops consol and tapped the display. The scan of the Covenant flagship appeared on the viewscreen. \"This is our objective.\"\n Haverson frowned. \"Chief, if we approach that ship we\u0027ll be blown out of the sky before we can even think about engaging them.\"\n \"Normally, yes,\" the Chief replied. \"But we\u0027re going to rig the Pelican as a fireship—we load it with Moray mines and send it out ahead of us. We\u0027ll have to remote-pilot the Pelican, but it can be accelerated past the point where a crew would black out. It\u0027ll draw enemy fire, drop a few mines, and let us slip by.\"\n Polaski\u0027s expression hardened into a frown.\n \"There a problem, Warrant Officer?\"\n \"No, Master Chief. I just hate to lose a good ship. That bird got us off Halo in one piece.\"\n He understood. Pilots got attached to their ships. They gave them names and human personalities. The Chief, however, never fell into that trap; he had long ago learned that any equipment was expendable. Except, maybe, Cortana.\n \"So we get close to the flagship,\" Haverson said and crossed his arms over his chest. \"Are we going nose to nose with a ship with a thousand times our firepower? Or are you planning another flyby?\"\n \"Neither.\" The Chief pointed to the flagship\u0027s fighter launch bay. \"That\u0027s our LZ.\"\n Polaski squinted at the comparatively tiny opening in the belly of the flagship. \"That\u0027s a hell of a window to hit coming in this fast, but\"—she bit her lower lip, calculating—\"technically possible in a Longsword.\"\n \"They\u0027ll launch Seraph fighters to engage the Pelican and the Longsword,\" the Chief said, \"and to do that, they\u0027ll have to drop that section of their shields. We get in, neutralize the crew, and we have a ship with Slipspace capability.\"\n \"Rock \u0027n\u0027 roll!\" Locklear yelled over the COM. \"Penetrate and annihilate!\"\n Sergeant Johnson chewed on his cigar as he considered the plan.\n \"No one has ever captured a Covenant ship,\" Haverson whis- pered. \"The few times we\u0027ve had one of them beaten and in a po- sition to surrender, they\u0027ve self-destructed.\"\n \"There\u0027s no choice,\" the Chief said. He looked over Polaski, Johnson, and finally Haverson. \"Unless anyone has a better plan?\"\n They were silent.\n \"Anything to add, Cortana?\" he asked.\n \"Our exit orbit burn leaves us low on fuel and traveling at high velocity on an intercept course with the flagship. There are overlapping fields of enemy fire on our approach vector. We have to decelerate and dodge simultaneously. That will be tricky.\"\n \"Polaski will be on that.\" The Chief turned to her.\n \"Pilot a Longsword?\" Polaski slowly nodded, and there was a gleam in her green eyes that hadn\u0027t been there a second ago.\n \"It\u0027s been a while, but yes, Master Chief. I am one hundred and ten percent on it.\" She moved to the pilot\u0027s seat and strapped herself in.\n \"With all due respect to Miss Polaski\u0027s skill,\" Cortana said, \"allow me to point out that I process information a million times faster and—\"\n \"I need you to link with the flagship\u0027s intraship battlenet,\" the Chief cut in. \"When we\u0027re close you\u0027ll need to shut down its weapons. Jam its communications.\"\n \"Sending an unescorted lady ahead to do your dirty work?\"\n Cortana sighed. \"I suppose I\u0027m the only one who can.\"\n \"Lieutenant Haverson,\" the Chief said, \"I\u0027ll need you to program the Moray mines to release and attach onto the Pelican before we exit this orbit. Set half for detonation on impact. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-first-strike-halo-3/page-7.html","bookId":1635,"book":{"id":1635,"title":"Halo: First Strike (Halo #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Halo: First Strike (Halo #3) \n The Human-Covenant war rages on as the alien juggernaut sweeps inexorably toward its final goal: destruction of all human life! \n Halo has been destroyed, and the threat it posed to sentient life, neutralized.
