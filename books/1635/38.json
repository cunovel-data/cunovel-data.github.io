Perhaps you can explain why you commandeered my personal property when I have showed nothing but good faith in this—\"\n \"Hold on to your shirttail, Governor,\" Admiral Whitcomb snapped. \"I\u0027m in the middle of finding out who took your ship and what precisely is going on. Cortana, any response to our hail?\"\n \"An automated code, sir,\" she said. Her mouth opened in as-tonishment. \"UNSC Code Three-Nine-Two.\"\n \"Three-Nine-Two?\" the Admiral asked. He stared into space, trying to recall the obscure code.\n The Master Chief cleared his throat and told him, \"Admiral, that is an official \u0027nonresponse\u0027 code, sir. Special Warfare teams use it to ignore hails... due to a higher-priority mission.\"\n \"God damn it.\" The Admiral\u0027s face flushed, and he ground his teeth. \"You mean the good doctor just told me to go to hell.\"\n On the forward screen the Chiroptera, its batlike wings nearly invisible against the black of space, accelerated in a sudden burst.\n Pinpoints of light appeared around the craft that elongated and smeared. The ship vanished.\n \"A Slipspace transition,\" Cortana said.\n \"I thought you told me,\" the Admiral said, slowly turning on Haverson, \"that that ship was locked down. That vital compo- nents were removed when it was decommissioned. That there was no way it could make a Slipspace jump?\"\n \"Yes, sir, I did.\"\n \"And would you care to explain why that ship just disap- peared, Lieutenant?\"\n \"Yes, Admiral. I was wrong,\" Haverson replied without meeting the Admiral\u0027s eyes. \"Doctor Halsey apparently found a way to circumvent the ONI lockout on the ship\u0027s systems.\"\n On screen, Jiles said, \"This is most unfortunate, Admiral. I expect to be compensated1—\"\n \"You bet it\u0027s unfortunate,\" Admiral Whitcomb said. \"If I\u0027d known there was a chance we could have used that ship to jump to Earth. . . I would have done it an hour ago. Cortana, what was her trajectory?\"\n \"Not Earth,\" Cortana said. \"Doctor Halsey\u0027s course points to no known system in my database.\"\n The Admiral scrutinized the forward screen: Jiles\u0027s face, the empty star field, and the frozen video of Dr. Halsey and Locklear in the launch bay. \"I want Corporal Locklear on the bridge ten minutes ago. Lieutenant Haverson, have Cortana locate him.\n Then I want you personally to escort that ODST up here.\"\n Haverson swallowed. \"Yes, sir.\" He marched to the elevator, and Cortana told him, \"He\u0027s on B-Deck, Lieutenant, medical storage. He\u0027s not answering my COM page.\" The elevator shut.\n \"Chief, you\u0027re on the Engineering console,\" the Admiral said.\n \"Cover the NAV station, too.\"\n \"Yes, sir.\" He moved to the Engineering station\u0027s monitors.\n There were thirty-five minutes to go on the shakedown cycle of the reactors and engines.\n \"Contact,\" Cortana said. \"Bearing zero-three-zero on the solar plane. One—correction, two—Covenant cruisers. They\u0027re not moving. Maybe they haven\u0027t spotted us.\"\n \"It never rains when it can monsoon,\" the Admiral declared.\n \"They can\u0027t help but see us, Cortana, with all the radio chatter, ships, and leaking radiation. I bet they\u0027re just figuring out how best to kill us.\"\n Governor Jiles turned to someone off screen, and then said, \"Admiral Whitcomb, given this new development I would like to evacuate my people off the Gettysburg and out of harm\u0027s way.\"\n \"Of course, Governor. Do what you have to.\"\n The number three screen snapped off, and the stars reappeared.\n \"And I\u0027ll do what I have to, too,\" Admiral Whitcomb said.\n \"Cortana, halt the reactor and engine shakedown.\"\n \"Sir? There are risks—\"\n \"I want them online now. Don\u0027t tell me what the risks are. Just doit.\"\n \"Yes, sir,\" she said.\n \"Master Chief, get this crate ready to move and stay on your toes. We\u0027ll need every trick in the book to outmaneuver two cruisers.\"\n \"Affirmative, Admiral.\" The Chief observed the shakedown cycle halt and Ascendant Justice\u0027s reactors restart. Radiation indicators redlined, and then dropped to a hairbreadth ... which was technically considered safe. The Gettysburg\u0027s engines shuddered to life. The Chief felt the vibration though the deck half a kilometer away. \"Reactors are hot, sir,\" he reported.\n The Admiral watched as Jiles\u0027s fleet of single ships and tech- nicians in jet packs abandoned the Gettysburg, swarming across the dark of space back to the safety of their asteroid. \"Rats leaving a sinking ship?\" he wondered aloud.\n The Master Chief wasn\u0027t sure if that was a question directed at him, but he decided to reply anyway. \"They\u0027re just men who want to live, sir.\"\n The Admiral nodded.\n \"Covenant cruiser accelerating,\" Cortana announced. \"Bearing on a vector otrtsystem. It\u0027s transitioning to Slipspace.\"\n \"Master Chief, get this tub moving. Now! Bring us up to half maximum speed.\"\n \"Aye, sir.\" He tapped in commands. \"Answering one half forward.\" The radiation warning on Ascendant Justice\u0027s reactor flickered, but stabilized and subsided.\n The combined mass of the two attached ships groaned as their recently repaired superstructures overcame their inertia.\n \"Heat up our plasma turrets, Cortana.\"\n \"Aye s—\" Her translucent lavender hologram faded to ice blue.\n \"Sir, additional contacts at system\u0027s edge. Three. No—additional transitions from Slipspace; counting eighteen—now thirty Covenant ships of various classes. Positions zero-three-zero.\n Zero-nine-one, one-eight-zero... Sir, they have us enveloped.\"\n The star chart vanished in a wink, and a map of the Eridanus system appeared with tiny triangles representing Covenant ships now encircling the perimeter. The map turned to a side profile and revealed half a dozen additional ships scattered along the nadir and zenith of the system.\n Admiral Whitcomb stared at the map and shook his head.\n \"You know the story of the Alamo, Chief?\"\n \"Yes, sir. A famous siege with a handful of defenders holding off overwhelming forces.\"\n The Admiral smiled. \"Texan defenders, Chief—there\u0027s a big difference. Colonel William Barrett Travis with one hundred fifty-five men held off more than two thousand Mexican invaders.\n They hunkered down inside a tiny fort and fought like wildcats.\n Travis got a handful of reinforcements later—thirty-two men.\"\n The Admiral\u0027s smile faded. \"You know there were fifteen civilians inside that fort, too?\" He looked at the map again. \"Well, when the fighting was over, Travis and his men were dead, but it cost the enemy six hundred lives.\"\n \"Like the Battle of Thermopylae,\" the Chief remarked.\n \"But there were survivors at the Alamo; they let the civilians live.\" He turned to the Chief. \"You think anyone\u0027s going to survive this fight? You think there\u0027s any way to win?\"\n The Master Chief tried to think of a way to fight and to win.\n Thirty Covenant ships against their damaged hybrid vessel. Add to that the need to defend Governor Jiles\u0027s crew. Could he board one of the Covenant craft? Get Cortana to infiltrate their systems and broadcast falsified orders? They would see him approaching.\n Or was there a blind spot he could approach from? How could he hide from the rest of the ships in their fleet, though? And by the time he could implement such a plan, the Gettysburg would be molten slag.\n \"It was a rhetorical question, Chief,\" the Admiral said.\n \"Yes, sir,\" the Chief replied. \"Given our situation, resources, and our enemy\u0027s determination, then, no, I see no way to win...\n or survive.\"\n \"Neither do I.\" Admiral Whitcomb stood straight. \"Cortana, get ready to jump. Chief, accelerate to flank speed course zero-five-five by two-nine-zero. Prepare to transition out of normal space on my mark.\"\n \"Aye, sir,\" the Chief and Cortana answered in unison.\n \"We\u0027re leaving Governor Jiles and his people?\" Cortana asked.\n Admiral Whitcomb was silent a long moment, and then he replied, \"We are. This isn\u0027t the Alamo and I\u0027m not Colonel Wil- liam Barrett Travis, although I dearly wish I were. No, we\u0027re run- ning. We\u0027re trading hundreds of lives for billions.\"\n The Master Chief absentmindedly reached for his belt pouch, and Dr. Halsey\u0027s data crystals clinked. \"Is this the right thing to do, sir?\"\n \"The right thing?\" Admiral Whitcomb sighed. \"Hell, son, it probably isn\u0027t. Personally, I\u0027d prefer to fight, and die fighting, and take every one of those Covenant bastards with me. But I do not have the liberty to make that choice. My duty is clear: to pro- tect the men and women of Earth—not a pack of privateers and outlaws.\" He closed his eyes and said, \"The logic of the situation r is also too damned clear. Even if we stay and fight... they\u0027ll all bejustasdead.\"\n \"Capacitors at foil charge,\" Cortana announced. \"Preparing to enter Slipspace. Waiting for your order, sir.\"\n The Master Chief saw the energy from Ascendant Justice\u0027s reactor drain to 5 percent. Motes of blue-green light appeared on the forward screen, and the stars stretched and smeared like watercolors.\n But something was wrong: The shields of the Chief\u0027s MJOLNIR armor rippled. The radiation monitors spiked. Where was it coming from?\n \"Hundreds for billions,\" the Admiral whispered. \"Duty be damned ... I\u0027m still going to burn in hell for this.\" Admiral Whitcomb inhaled deeply and closed his eyes.\n \"Go, Cortana. Get us out of here. And God forgive me.\"\n Corporal Locklear whistled, and the robotic dolly obediently followed him. The rolling robot was stacked with rifles, pistols, ammunition crates, and enough C-7 foaming explosive to blow a half-kilometer crater in the side of the Gettysburg.\n He made his way to the cargo elevator and then down to B-Deck. He had seen on the Gettysburg\u0027s inventory that that was where they stored medical supplies... and he wanted a few cans of biofoam handy for the Master Chief\u0027s extremely well-planned suicide mission.\n Not that Locklear had anything against a good suicide mis- sion. He\u0027d been on plenty before, and they seemed to give him the most bang for his buck. Only now, after so much fighting, he just wanted a break: twenty-four hours of sleep, and some R\u0026R.\n He idly tugged at the bandanna tied to his biceps.\n \"Damn girl,\" he whispered. \"Why\u0027d you have to die? I had plans for you and me.\"\n What was he doing mooning over a woman? And a Navy flier to boot? His squad would have laughed themselves wet if they knew... only they were all dead, too.\n \"Screw this,\" Locklear said. \"I\u0027m still alive. I\u0027m not going to die. And I\u0027m not going to feel guilty for any of this.\"\n He laughed and told himself, \"It\u0027s not like the entire universe hasn\u0027t been trying to kill me off, though.\" Locklear turned to the robotic dolly. \"Right, amigo?\"\n Its treads spun, and the flatbed dolly turned to the right.\n \"No, no, stop.\" He sighed. \"Man, I gotta buy myself a ticket out of this outfit. Next thing, I\u0027ll be asking one of the Spartans out on a date. . . if I could even tell the boys from the girls in that squad.\" He shuddered.\n The doors of the large cargo elevator squeaked open; Lock- lear stepped off, and whistled for the dolly to follow.\n Storage Bay Two had racks and shelves that rose from the deck five meters to the ceiling. He played his flashlight over the uneven surfaces. He spied a desk and terminal in the corner.\n \"Hello, inventory control,\" he said. \"The place to go for good-ies in any Navy outfit.\" He strode to the desk, sat down, and tapped in a search for medicinal-grade ethyl alcohol.\n A tone chimed in his earpiece, and Cortana\u0027s voice said, \"Cor- poral Locklear, I have an urgent request from Admiral—\"\n Locklear squelched his COM. \"Enough chatter, lady,\" he murmured. \"The bar just opened.\"\n The location for MED34-CH3CH2OH popped on screen.\n \"B-I-N-G-O,\"hesang.\n Locklear jumped up. \"Come on, amigo. You and me are going to throw a party.\"\n The deck lurched under Locklear\u0027s feet. \"What the?... We\u0027re moving?\" He turned the inventory display to face him and tapped in a command to switch to external camera mode.\n Craggy asteroids moved past them—no, it was the Gettysburg that was moving. Locklear squinted and saw a flash of blue. He magnified that part of the screen and found a dozen blurry blue flares from engine cones and the pulsing lateral lines filled with plasma. Covenant ships.\n \"Ah hell,\" he said and backed away from the desk. \"So much for happy hour.\"\n Something moved in his vest. Locklear reached in his pocket and pulled out the crystal Dr. Halsey entrusted to his care. The elongated stone rippled, facets moved and rearranged like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.\n He spied the same blue color on the inventory monitor— pinpricks of stretched space, the first indication of a Slip-space jump.\n \"I\u0027m not going through another Slipspace fight,\" Locklear said through gritted teeth. \"I\u0027m not going to let them follow us.\n Or let this thing shoot off a signal flare to every Covenant ship in the galaxy.\"\n He grabbed a can of C-7 off the dolly and dropped Dr. Halsey\u0027s crystal on the deck. He quickly covered the thing with the foam- ing explosive. It hardened to a stiff resin in a matter of seconds.\n Locklear grabbed a detonator, inserted it into the foam, and con- nected it to a timer.\n Why had the doc given him this to guard? She said because the ONI spooks wouldn\u0027t have the guts to get rid of it if they had to ... would maybe even let it fall into Covenant hands. That made sense, but, at the same time, there was something not quite right with that explanation.\n Locklear looked at the monitor and the pinpoints of light that now almost blotted out the stars.\n Screw it.\n He had his own reasons to blow this thing up—like not want- ing to die in another space battle. Like maybe getting some pay- back for Polaski\u0027s death. The Covenant rat-bastards wanted it so bad? Well, screw them, too. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-first-strike-halo-3/page-38.html","bookId":1635,"book":{"id":1635,"title":"Halo: First Strike (Halo #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Halo: First Strike (Halo #3) \n The Human-Covenant war rages on as the alien juggernaut sweeps inexorably toward its final goal: destruction of all human life! \n Halo has been destroyed, and the threat it posed to sentient life, neutralized.
