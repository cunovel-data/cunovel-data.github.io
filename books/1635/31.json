He loved the men and women un- der his command as if they were his own sons and daughters. It was the old axiom of command: To be a good leader, you had to love the service. To be a great commander, you had to be willing to destroy that which you loved. Static crackled, and the Master Chief reported in: \"We\u0027re in position, Admiral. ETA for repairs is two minutes.\" \"Roger, Chief,\" Admiral Whitcomb replied. \"When you\u0027re done give the word and get secure. We\u0027ll be accelerating immediately.\" \"Yes, sir.\" Thunder rumbled through the deck. \"Plasma impacts, sir,\" Cortana explained. \"Their energy profile has diffused, but they were still powerful enough to knock the lateral sensors and cameras offline.\" Admiral Whitcomb smoothed his thick fingers over his mus- tache. \"We\u0027ve got only a few minutes before this space tears us apart.\" He squinted at the wall displays, trying to count the number of enemy craft. \"That\u0027s if those Covenant ships don\u0027t do the job first.\" He turned to Cortana. \"How many enemy ships are there? Which are real and which are illusion?\" \"Impossible to accurately determine, sir. I counted fourteen targets before they started firing and filling the space between us with ionizing plasma. Now? ...\" Mathematical symbols raced along her length, flashing blue and indigo. \"Cross-indexing similar mirrored images and extrapolating, I estimate there are currently between three and five operational ships, sir.\" Admiral Whitcomb gritted his teeth and concentrated. He had to get this ship moving—take out one or two enemy craft. Maybe the tangled plasma-filled space would cook the rest of them. That was their best chance. Their only chance. He\u0027d have to trust the Master Chief to get that drive conduit fixed. \"Very well, Cortana,\" he said. \"Heat the Gettysburg\u0027s reactor to maximum power and prepare to flood the main-engine plasma conduit. Charge all available weapons turret capacitors.\" \"Yes, sir. Standby.\" He glanced at a screen that showed the Gettysburg sitting atop them inverted. \"Is the launch bay on the Gettysburg intact? Can it hold an atmosphere?\" Cortana blinked. \"Yes, sir. It has a slow leak of thirty-two kilo pascals per—\" \"Pressurize the bay.\" \"Acknowledged, Admiral. However,\" Cortana replied, \"that will leave our air reserves dangerously low.\" The Admiral stared at the ships surrounding them—a plasma bolt struck a distant cruiser head-on, and its nose buckled. Gouts of flame flared along its lateral plasma lines. The ship looked like a fish spit with a red-hot poker. That could have been them. \"Hurry up, Chief,\" he whispered. On the displays the Admiral spotted two ships. There was a carrier far away; it looked undamaged. Closer, off the port bow, was a cruiser that, aside from a hole punched through its aft sec- tion, was also undamaged ... and only ten thousand kilometers away. That was the priority target. \"Lay in a new course,\" the Admiral ordered. \"Two-four-zero by zero-three-five.\" Lieutenant Haverson took an involuntary step closer to the display, and his face contorted as he worked out the math in his head. \"That\u0027s. . . a collision course, sir.\" \"Glad you concur with my calculations,\" the Admiral re- marked dryly. Lieutenant Haverson glanced at the Gettysburg and nodded, finally understanding. \"Aye, sir. A good plan.\" \"Admiral,\" the Master Chief\u0027s voice broke through in a wash of static. \"Hull breach is sealed, sir.\" \"Hang on, son,\" Admiral Whitcomb said. \"This might be a rough ride. Cortana, give me flank speed now!\" \"Complying,\" Cortana said. \"Flank speed. Conduit is holding. Coming about to two-four-zero by zero-three-five. Colli- sion with Covenant cruiser at this speed and heading in eighteen seconds.\" Ascendant Justice-Gettysburg accelerated toward a line of wavering orange plasma—and steamed through it like a ship smashing through a storm wave on the open seas. Fire splashed over their hulls and burned away layers of ar- mor. The entire hull superstructure groaned. Explosions rever- berated through the deck. \"Fire on decks eight through twelve,\" Cortana reported. \"We have lost plasma turret five. Distance to enemy ship six thousand kilometers and closing.\" \"Initiate a roll, Cortana. Make it thirty degrees per second. That\u0027ll spread out the damage over more surface area.\" \"Roll maneuver, aye. Attitude thrusters set to maximum burn.\" She exhaled, and her holographic image flickered with irrita- tion. \"This will make a targeting solution difficult, sir.\" \"Set firing range of plasma turrets for point blank,\" the Admiral told her. Cortana hesitated for a full second. \"Yes, Admiral.\" The space on the external cameras slowly began to spin as their ship spiraled toward their intended target. The Covenant cruiser came about to face them. Its plasma tur- rets glowed like angry red eyes. \"Lieutenant, take the weapons station. Cortana, give us a firing solution and manual fire control.\" Haverson\u0027s hands moved quickly over the Covenant holo- graphic control surfaces. \"Cortana has a firing solution, sir. Activate weapons?\" \"Stand by, Lieutenant.\" \"They\u0027ll get off the first salvo, sir,\" Lieutenant Haverson said. Although his voice was calm, a drop of sweat trickled down his freckled cheek. \"I hope they do,\" the Admiral replied. \"It may be the only thing that saves us.\" Lieutenant Haverson took a deep breath, nodding. \"Weapons standing by, sir.\" \"Cortana, make ready to vent the Gettysburg\u0027s launch bay.\" \"Aye, sir. Overriding bay door safeties. Distance to target three thousand kilometers.\" The Covenant cruiser fired. Lances of energy launched and veered toward Ascendant Justice ... and arced away in cork- screw spirals and right angles. The space between the two large masses was still tangled and fractured. \"Two thousand kilometers,\" Cortana reported. \"Stay on course,\" the Admiral said. \"And continue to hold fire.\" Lieutenant Haverson\u0027s jaw clenched, and his hands trembled over the controls. The enemy cruiser filled the displays. Its plasma turrets re- cycled and glowed a dull red. \"One thousand kilometers,\" Cortana announced. \"Admiral?\" Lieutenant Haverson asked. \"Hold your fire.\" \"Five hundred kilometers,\" Cortana said. \"Three hundred... two... collision imminent.\" The Admiral\u0027s fist clenched. He barked, \"Fire! All turrets, fire! Cortana, depressurize the launch bay and give us full power to port.\" Ascendant Justice was a kilometer from the Covenant ship on an intercept course when it fired. The Gettysburg\u0027s launch bay doors opened and the air inside explosively decompressed— propelling the conjoined ships to port—just enough to miss the cruiser. Plasma rocketed toward their target. There was no way to miss. White-hot fire impacted on the cruiser\u0027s hull, splashed across its surface, boiled off the armored skin, and corroded the skeletal framework underneath. \"Aft cameras,\" the Admiral ordered. On screen he saw fire explode out the opposite side of the cruiser. The warship tilted and rolled belly-up, plasma disinte- grating the interior from stern to stem until it reached the fusion core. The ship detonated in a ball of flame. An instant later the explosion twisted and curved as the warped Slipspace field swept away all traces of the enemy ship. Lieutenant Haverson exhaled and wiped his brow. \"Excellent maneuvering, Admiral.\" \"Don\u0027t waste your breath on victory speeches yet, son.\" The Admiral scrutinized the tactical display and spotted the other ship. \"There. We\u0027ve got a new target.\" He pointed to a ship half obscured in the plasma fog: the car- rier, intact, with a cloud of gnats swarming about it. Seraph fighters dived and intercepted plasma and meteor bolts that got too close. The resulting fireballs deflected the impacts from the hull. \"She\u0027s got a smart Captain,\" the Admiral muttered. \"So we can\u0027t use the same trick twice.\" Five explosions rattled Ascendant Justice, and the ambient blue light on the bridge flickered. \"Meteor impact,\" Cortana replied. \"We just lost plasma turrets two and three. All functionality on decks eight and below has been lost. The structural integrity of this ship, sir, is in danger of imminent collapse.\" \"Another minute, Cortana,\" the Admiral told her and continued to search the tactical display. \"We either take out that carrier here—where their shields can\u0027t regenerate—or we face them in normal space.\" He tapped the TAC map. \"Gotcha! Cortana, come about to zero-three-zero by one-four-five, calculate the fastest accelera- tion and deceleration burns this ship can handle to get us to this object, and move this ship ASAP.\" \"Yes, Admiral.\" Lieutenant Haverson looked at the map and located what the Admiral pointed at. \"That object is just part of a Covenant ship, the aft section of a cruiser.\" The Admiral nodded. \"Exactly, Lieutenant. Cortana, how\u0027s the structural integrity of our ship\u0027s nose?\" \"Sir? The nose?\" Cortana paused, then reported, \"Intact, sir. Most of the damage has been to the lateral—\" \"Bring us into direct contact with that hunk of metal, Cortana.\" \"Aye, sir,\" Cortana replied. Ascendant Justice accelerated toward the broken Covenant ship, and then slowed. The two warships touched; there was a slow grinding noise that echoed along the ship\u0027s frame. \"Contact,\" Cortana reported. \"Perfect,\" Admiral Whitcomb replied. \"New course three-two-zero by two-two-zero. Flank speed. Lieutenant, charge any plasma turret we have left. Cortana, get this ship ready for full reverse power.\" Ascendant Justice—Gettysburg turned and moved toward the Covenant carrier—pushing the broken hull of the other ship be- fore them. They accelerated on a collision course. The turrets on the Covenant carrier heated to white hot—but they held their fire. \"Eight thousand kilometers to enemy ship,\" Cortana announced. \"Hold this course, Cortana.\" \"Six thousand kilometers, sir.\" \"Stand by,\" the Admiral ordered and gripped the railing again with his sweating hands. \"Two thousand kilometers.\" \"Full reverse power now!\" The engines rumbled, and the hull of Ascendant Justice shuddered. The wrecked Covenant ship on their nose screeched as its mo- mentum carried it along at the faster velocity. It pulled free of Ascendant Justice ... tumbled directly toward the enemy carrier. \"Mass impact on carrier in four seconds,\" Cortana said. \"Three seconds.\" The carrier fired its plasma at the incoming mass. Flames heated the wreckage, punched though its armor and hull, and melted the alloy. The mass, however, continued forward, shattered and molten— but its velocity was undiminished. It crashed into the carrier and sent it spinning to starboard. The carrier\u0027s hull breached along a dozen rents, and atmosphere vented and fanned the red-hot metal into gold flames. The launch bays chained with explosions. \"Fire all weapons, Lieutenant!\" Ascendant Justice fired its remaining turrets. Plasma cut into the carrier and sliced it to the core. Every deck flashed with fire and became an inferno. \"That\u0027s the best we can do,\" Admiral Whitcomb whispered. \"Cortana, get us out of here. Transition to normal space.\" Cortana\u0027s holographic silhouette blackened with swarming calculations. \"Engaging Slipspace matrix.\" Blotches of inky black welled within the sea of fire. Tiny stars winked on within those pools of darkness. The plasma-charged atmosphere faded, and the enemy ships ablaze vanished. \"Cut all power to the engines,\" the Admiral ordered. Admiral Whitcomb gazed at the blackness and stars. \"Now, where the hell are we?\" SECTION 5 MASSACRE AT ERIDANUS SECUNDUS CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX TIME-.DATE RECORD [[ERROR]]ANOMALY\\Date unknown\\ Captured Covenant flagship Ascendant Justice, in anomalous Slipspace bubble. The Master Chief woke. Consciousness, however, was a slight overestimation of his condition. His blurry vision came into focus slowly... but there was nothing to see except the interior of his visor. Amber status lights winked on. Pain washed over his feet, his right thigh, and his hand. Good. He was alive. He knew from previous experience that this was the tail end of shock ... and the stunning, numbing effects of that state were wearing off. He felt the familiar weight and reactive circuits of his MJOLNIR armor surrounding him. The coppery-tinged flavor of biofoam coated his mouth, so he also surmised that his injuries had been recently treated. And there was gravity. The press against his back was a great comfort to the Master Chief. The next time someone wanted him to go on a zero-gee op, he\u0027d— \"Welcome back,\" Cortana said, interrupting his thoughts. A faint light flickered on to his left. He turned onto his side. The burns on his extremities pro- tested and shot lances of pain up his hand and feet. He was in a med bay. The lights were turned down low, and he saw that he was the only person occupying a recovery bed. Bio-monitors pulsed along one wall, displaying his vital signs and MRI snapshots. A holographic projection pad stood next to his bed. Cortana\u0027s tiny figure, strobing with symbolic logic code, waved to him, and when he didn\u0027t immediately respond she crossed her arms impatiently. \"MRIs show no concussion, no subdural or epidural hematomas. You must have a thicker skull than I thought.\" \"Where am I?\" \"Deck thirty-two on the UNSC frigate Gettysburg\" Cortana told him. \"Or what\u0027s left of it, anyway.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-first-strike-halo-3/page-31.html","bookId":1635,"book":{"id":1635,"title":"Halo: First Strike (Halo #3)","description":"Storyline: Halo: First Strike (Halo #3) The Human-Covenant war rages on as the alien juggernaut sweeps inexorably toward its final goal: destruction of all human life!
