Food and water. We\u0027ll need them, too.\"\n Will grabbed them as well.\n \"Just a few more things,\" Dr. Halsey whispered. \"We can\u0027t let them get into ONI\u0027s records.\" She tapped her pad once and then said to Kalmiya, \"Begin Operation White Glove. Irradiate all computer memory crystal. Code file access Beta-Foxtrot-99874.\"\n Dr. Halsey closed her eyes as if she were concentrating, and she whispered, \"Not all AIs have the fail-safe option, my dear Kalmiya... just the ones that matter.\"\n \"I understand, Doctor.\" There was a pause, and the AI spoke again, her voice sad. \"Voice and fingerprint accepted and verified. Fail-safe code verified. It has been . . . a pleasure working with you, Doctor Halsey.\"\n \"The pleasure has been mine, Kalmiya.\" She stood straighter and said, \"Fail-safe override access: \u0027Ragnarok.\u0027 Give us a three-minute countdown.\"\n A three-minute counter appeared in the corner of Fred\u0027s heads-up display.\n Dr. Halsey turned to him. \"I\u0027ve activated the explosives cache under this base, which will level the complex. We have to get be- low, to the original titanium mine tunnels.\"\n Fred wished she had consulted with him before she had given them only three minutes. Then again, Dr. Halsey knew what was at stake, what secrets were hidden in this base, and what damage could occur if the Covenant got their hands on those secrets.\n Five minutes might be too much time considering what was at risk.\n \"Understood,\" Fred replied. \"Isaac, you\u0027re rear guard. Vinh, stick close to Kelly. I\u0027ll take Doctor Halsey.\" Fred picked up the doctor with great care. She couldn\u0027t have weighed more than fifty kilos—light as a stick.\n \"I\u0027ve lost targets on motion sensors,\" Vinh whispered over the COM. \"They were close, too.\"\n \"Kelly, watch for camouflaged Elites.\"\n \"Affirmative,\" she said. She scanned the room, moved to a cabinet, and grabbed a tin can marked TALC.\n \"Let\u0027s move,\" Fred ordered. \"Kalmiya, kill the lights in the base. Hand signals only—I want radio silence.\"\n Four blue acknowledgment lights winked on.\n The faint light filtering in from the outer hall died.\n Kelly slid into the hallway and melted into the shadows. Vinh followed, then Fred and Isaac. Will trailed behind, moving slower because of the care he took to remain quiet with the gear.\n Dr. Halsey tapped her data pad, and a map uploaded onto Fred\u0027s heads-up display, a path traced through corridors and a NAV marker designated an elevator shaft. That was their objective.\n The Spartans winked on their acknowledgment lights, con- firming the route.\n They crept forward, smooth and silent—oil sliding over oil— until Kelly halted ten meters before a five-way intersection. The Spartans froze and waited. She crouched, set the can of talc on the floor, and then stood with her knees bent.\n She waited another heartbeat, then gave a slight shake of her head from side to side—their signal for trouble ahead.\n Vinh moved next to Fred\u0027s flank, and Fred set Dr. Halsey down and stood in front of her. Will crouched next to the doctor to provide cover with his own body if needed.\n Isaac remained on their six.\n Kelly kicked the can. It tumbled end over end through the air, and as it entered the intersection Kelly squeezed off a single shot. The flash of light from the muzzle illuminated the passage just long enough for them to see the can explode and a cloud of white dust mushroom into the hallways.\n Their motion detectors flickered, and four targets resolved on their displays. Image enhancement showed the wavering out- lines of four Covenant Elites—their light-bending camouflage fluttering and overloading as the talc powder coated them.\n Kelly open fire with both pistols. The Elite closest dropped as three slugs pounded through its shields, and a round caught it in the center of its elongated forehead. Purple blood blossomed across the wall.\n The remaining Elites returned fire, and Kelly bounded for- ward, plasma flaring at the edge of her shield. She ducked into the side passage.\n The instant Kelly was out of the line of fire, Fred shouldered his rifle and squeezed the trigger. A three-round burst caught the next Elite, and its shield sparkled and failed. It twisted away, clutching at the single round that had penetrated its chest.\n Vinh fired two single shots, but the Elite\u0027s shield held. In uni- son, Vinh and Fred fired another set of three-round bursts. The Elite dropped to the steel floor in a twisted heap.\n The last Elite had vanished. No return fire. No sensor contact.\n The Spartans held position for a moment longer, then re- grouped. With hand signals, each member of the team reported no contact.\n Fred spied tracks in the white dust scattered on the floor.\n The Elite had bugged out, and it was most likely gathering reinforcements.\n That wasn\u0027t what Covenant Elites usually did. Their pride de- manded that they fight, and die fighting, if need be. They would hurl themselves headlong into battle, no matter the odds, and die by the hundreds if necessary. They never ran away. Nothing about this engagement had been \"usual.\"\n Fred glanced at Will and Dr. Halsey. Will gave him a thumbs-up, indicating that the doctor hadn\u0027t been wounded in the exchange.\n After the exchange of gunfire, there was no need for secrecy.\n \"One of them got away,\" Fred told them. \"We need to move, too...\n and forget quiet.\"\n The Spartans ran down the corridor. They heard and felt an- other explosion directly over their heads.\n Kelly skidded to a halt in front of the locked elevator doors.\n She gripped one of the panels; Fred and Vinh gripped the seam of the other side, and the Spartans pried them apart as if the five-centimeter steel alloy were no tougher than the rind of an orange.\n Kelly grabbed the elevator cables and slid down. Vinh fol- lowed, then Fred plummeted more than five hundred meters into the darkness. The three of them ripped open the doors at the bot- tom of the shaft.\n Will slid down next with Dr. Halsey holding on to his neck.\n Isaac followed.\n \"There should be an air vent,\" Dr. Halsey whispered. \"There.\"\n Kelly ripped off the vent cover and peered down.\n \"It leads to the old mine tunnels,\" Dr. Halsey told them, \"and more, I hope.\"\n \"Go,\" Fred ordered.\n Kelly dived in, headfirst. They waited ten seconds, and her ac- knowledgment light winked on.\n Fred entered next, sliding through the vent duct. It twisted and turned and finally dumped him into a long tunnel of roughly hewn granite. The ceiling was ten meters high and—judging from the three-meter-wide tire tracks in the dust—big enough for heavy equipment to have rolled through.\n Will slid out of the duct with Dr. Halsey riding on his chest.\n Vinh and Isaac came after them.\n \"There\u0027s more to this place,\" Dr. Halsey told them, standing up and brushing the dust from her lab coat. \"This is only the be-ginning. We have to—\"\n A thunderous detonation cut her off. The mountain exploded, and ONI\u0027s base collapsed over their heads.\n CHAPTER FIFTEEN\n 0002 hours, September 7,2552 (Military Calendar) \\ ONI underground facility, planet Reach.\n Fred followed the trail of odd symbols along the left-hand stone wall until they twisted into a spiral mosaic and vanished into ever-smaller curls. The symbols were part of the rock, com- posed of glittering mica inclusions in the granite matrix. There were a series of squares, triangles, bars, and dots, similar to Covenant calligraphy he had seen—but at the same time it was simpler, cleaner, and when Fred focused on them, the characters seemed to blur around their edges and fade from his stare.\n He blinked, and the symbols were there again.\n Following these symbols like a trail of bread crumbs had been his primary mission for the last five days. Dr. Halsey and the Spartans had explored the extensive caverns, hoping to find two things: a way out, and what Dr. Halsey called \"the most impor- tant discovery of the millennium.\" She had, however, refused to speculate on what exactly this discovery would be. \"I\u0027m a scientist,\" she\u0027d told them, \"not a soothsayer.\"\n Fred would have settled for finding an airhole to the surface— but he recognized that the symbols were important, too. They were important because the Covenant thought they were impor- tant. And that made whatever Dr. Halsey was searching for worth finding, if only to keep the enemy from getting it.\n The Covenant hadn\u0027t stopped digging overhead, although the pace and methods they used had changed. There had been no further explosions. There was only the constant and gentle scraping sound of equipment as they slowly but steadily re- moved the mountain. Every hour the sound intensified as they drew closer. Fred had set his audio filters to screen out the noise so he could concentrate.\n Five days. It hadn\u0027t seemed that long. They worked, they rested, they slept, and they waited. Dr. Halsey had taught them word games like twenty questions and simple cipher, at which they all became extremely proficient—so much so that she quickly stopped playing. Dr. Halsey was not a graceful loser.\n The time had melted away. Maybe it was the darkness, the lack of any temporal reference like the sun, moon, and stars, but the hours had lost their meaning.\n He paused to stretch his Achilles tendon, recently stitched and fused by Dr. Halsey. Aside from some stiffness, it was almost back to normal. He had almost torn the tendon off, running on the injury.\n Dr. Halsey had patched them all up; she had even flash cloned Kelly a new partial lung, which she successfully grafted. In her tiny field medical kit, the doctor had a handheld MRI, a sterile field generator, even a shoe-box-sized clone tank for organ duplication.\n She had also installed the new MJOLNIR parts in their exist- ing armor. These upgrades were in field-testing and not certified, she had explained, but she gauged their need sufficient to justify the risk of using the new equipment.\n Kelly received an improvement to her neural induction cir- cuits, giving her twitch response time a speed boost. Vinh had a new linear accelerator added to her shield system, effectively doubling its strength. Isaac had a new image-enhancing com- puter installed. Will received a better tracking system on his heads-up display, which improved his accuracy at distances up to a thousand meters.\n Fred flexed his bare right hand. Dr. Halsey was installing his upgrade now—new sensors that would boost the sensitivity of his motion tracker. Without the single gauntlet, Fred felt vul- nerable. The Master Chief would have told him not to rely on his armor or weapons—rely instead on his head. It would protect him better.\n He wondered how Blue Team—John, Linda, and James—had fared. And what of the rest of his own team? Had anyone at the generator complex survived?\n He didn\u0027t want to think about them—but he couldn\u0027t help it.\n Maybe it was the darkness and the constant weight of the earth around him.\n What if they died here? Not died fighting, but just died here.\n In a way, that wouldn\u0027t be so bad. Fred had faced death a dozen times, brushed so close to it he had stared it in the face until it blinked and turned away.\n This was different, though. He didn\u0027t want to die, not without knowing if the other Spartans were still out there fighting. Not if they still needed him.\n He sighed and absentmindedly brushed his fingertips across the odd symbols. They were as smooth as glass, and their edges were sharp. These crystals could be a natural phenomenon. He had seen similar inclusions in the museum on— Fred felt a hot pain in the tip of his finger. He drew his bare hand away and a tiny track of blood smeared the rock.\n The glittering symbols on the wall took on a greasy cast, and the reflection from his helmet lights thickened and almost seemed to be absorbed by the minerals.\n He flicked off his helmet lights. The symbols in the rock emit- ted a faint illumination of their own: a soft reddish glow like heated metal. The light intensified and spread across the spiral on the wall, starting from where his blood had fallen; those sym- bols warmed to a pleasant orange, then yellow-gold.\n A new symbol in the center of the spiral appeared that hadn\u0027t been there a second ago . . . or perhaps it had been, but had lain just beneath the surface. It heated and became increasingly visi- ble, a single triangle that glowed white.\n Fred was inexorably drawn to this central figure. He reached for it; there was no heat. He slowly stretched and touched the symbol with his exposed fingertip.\n Warm white light raced along the spiral of symbols, then traced a path down the hallway and into the distance. The entire cavern seemed sudden alive with radiance and shadow. Even with the step-down luminosity filters in his helmet, Fred had to blink and squint.\n The wall before him rumbled and seams appeared at the cen- tral figure, dozen of lines that curved in a radial pattern—and then pulled away to reveal a corridor behind.\n Fred realized that he was holding his breath. He exhaled.\n This new corridor was twenty meters high—large enough for a titan to stride down its length. It vanished into the distance, a straight line that gently sloped deeper into the earth. The floor was paved with asymmetric blue tiles patterned to look like waves lapping upon a shore. Four-meter-tall symbols of gold were centered and inlaid into the mirror-smooth walls. These gi- ant triangles, squares, bars, and circles began to emit the same soft light... and Fred felt his foot shuffle forward.\n He stopped, shook his head, and looked away. He checked his radiation counter; it pulsed, and then fell back to a normal back- ground count.\n He keyed the COM. \"Doctor Halsey, I think I\u0027ve found what you\u0027ve been looking for. Sending video feed now. Copy?\"\n There was a long pause. The COM was open, but Dr. Halsey wasn\u0027t responding.\n \"Doctor Halsey, copy?\"\n \"Yes,\" she finally said over the COM. \"Don\u0027t move, Fred. And don\u0027t touch anything. Excellent work. Kelly, Isaac, Vinh, Will— meet me at Fred\u0027s location.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-first-strike-halo-3/page-19.html","bookId":1635,"book":{"id":1635,"title":"Halo: First Strike (Halo #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Halo: First Strike (Halo #3) \n The Human-Covenant war rages on as the alien juggernaut sweeps inexorably toward its final goal: destruction of all human life! \n Halo has been destroyed, and the threat it posed to sentient life, neutralized.
