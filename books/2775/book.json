After everything Trystan went through to tell Mari that he loves her, there is no way that he\u0027s letting her walk away without knowing how he really feels. Every mask is stripped away making Trystan completely vulnerable. Mari\u0027s the one girl he wants, that he knew he\u0027d never have. But, the look on Mari\u0027s face--the way she kissed him--makes Trystan think that confessing his feelings was worth the risk. Shocked, Mari stands there staring at Trystan. As if it weren\u0027t enough that Trystan is internet super star, Day Jones, but the song he wrote was about her. That was her name on the music. It was her name etched into his heart. Trystan Scott loves her. Everything Mari wants is within reach. She just has to have enough guts to reach out and take it.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/riptide-the-secret-life-of-trystan-scott-3.jpg","author":"H.M.
