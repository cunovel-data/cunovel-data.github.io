PENN STANDS TREAT—A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE—HOW TO PRESERVE THE HAIR. \\n\\n \\n\\n The first colony of Pennsylvania was founded in 1682 by Wm. Penn, a Quaker gentleman of steady habits, who, with remarkable foresight settled at Philadelphia, because he thought it an eligible place to hold a Centennial Exhibition.

The coincidence of resemblance is indeed striking, though it must be admitted he is not unlike a cigar sign either. \\n\\n \\n\\n PENN’S TREATY WITH THE INDIANS \\n\\n \\n\\n 76Wm. Penn bought property in Philadelphia, where he resided for thirty-six years, getting along very well with the neighbors.
