It is always very noble and all that sort of thing when a nation or individuals sacrifice anything for a principle. Sometimes such sacrifice meets with immediate reward and sometimes the reward is delayed and the parties making the sacrifice have to wait indefinitely for their pay. A little incident which befel an ancestor of ours illustrates both these propositions to some extent, and having a few moments to spare we are tempted to relate it briefly, as follows.

As a reward for his valiant conduct, Washington begged our ancestor to accept the unexploded shell, which the latter resolved to preserve as a souvenir of the adventure and hand down to posterity. He carried it with him on many a weary march. ’Tis true he found it a serious inconvenience ofttimes. But he remembered posterity and pressed on Here we see him handing the relic down to posterity. In after years posterity handed it over to an obnoxious female relative, who irreverently used it as a candlestick.
