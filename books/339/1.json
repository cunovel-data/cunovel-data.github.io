My legs seemed tomove slower and slower as I fought my way through the callous crowd, but the hands on the huge clocktower didn\u0027t slow. With relentless, uncaring force, they turned inexorably toward the end—the end ofeverything.\n 　　But this was no dream, and, unlike the nightmare, I wasn\u0027t running for my life; I was racing to savesomething infinitely more precious. My own life meant little to me today.\n 　　Alice had said there was a good chance we would both die here.
