{"id":13591,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 11 Cult","content":"EACH TIME THAT I OPENED MY EYES TO THE MORNING light and realized I\u0027d lived throughanother night was a surprise to me. After the surprise wore off, my heart would start to race and mypalms would sweat; I couldn\u0027t really breathe again until I\u0027d gotten up and ascertained that Charlie hadsurvived as well. 　　I could tell he was worried—watching me jump at any loud sound, or my face suddenly go white for noreason that he could see. From the questions he asked now and then, he seemed to blame the change on Jacob\u0027s continued absence. 　　The terror that was always foremost in my thoughts usually distracted me from the fact that another weekhad passed, and Jacob still hadn\u0027t called me. But when I was able to concentrate on my normal life—ifmy life was really ever normal—this upset me. 　　I missed him horribly. 　　It had been bad enough to be alone before I was scared silly. Now, more than ever, I yearned for hiscarefree laugh and his infectious grin. I needed the safe sanity of his homemade garage and his warmhand around my cold fingers. 　　I\u0027d half expected him to call on Monday. If there had been some progress with Embry, wouldn\u0027t he wantto report it? I wanted to believe that it was worry for his friend that was occupying all his time, not that hewas just giving up on me. 　　I called him Tuesday, but no one answered. Were the phone lines still having problems? Or had Billyinvested in caller I.D.? 　　On Wednesday I called every half hour until after eleven at night, desperate to hear the warmth ofJacob\u0027s voice. 　　Thursday I sat in my truck in front of my house—with the locks pushed down—keys in hand, for a solidhour. I was arguing with myself, trying to justify a quick trip to La Push, but I couldn\u0027t do it. 　　I knew that Laurent had gone back to Victoria by now. If I went to La Push, I took the chance of leadingone of them there. What if they caught up to me when Jake was nearby? As much as it hurt me, I knew itwas better for Jacob that he was avoiding me. Safer for him. 　　It was bad enough that I couldn\u0027t figure out a way to keep Charlie safe. Nighttime was the most likelytime that they would come looking ior me, and what could I say to get Charlie out of the house? If I toldhim the truth, he\u0027d have me locked up in a rubber room somewhere. I would have enduredthat—welcomed it, even—if it could have kept him safe. But Victoria would still come to his house first,looking for me. Maybe, if she found me here, that would be enough for her. Maybe she would just leavewhen she was done with me. 　　So I couldn\u0027t run away. Even if I could, where would I go? To Renee? I shuddered at the thought ofdragging my lethal shadows into my mother\u0027s safe, sunny world. I would never endanger her that way. 　　The worry was eating a hole in my stomach. Soon I would have matching punctures. 　　That night, Charlie did me another favor and called Harry again to see if the Blacks were out of town. 　　Harry reported that Billy had attended the council meeting Wednesday night, and never mentionedanything about leaving. Charlie warned me not to make a nuisance of myself—Jacob would call when hegot around to it. 　　Friday afternoon, as I drove home from school, it hit me out of the blue. 　　I wasn\u0027t paying attention to the familiar road, letting the sound of the engine deaden my brain and silencethe worries, when my subconscious delivered a verdict it must have been working on for some timewithout my knowledge. 　　As soon as I thought of it, I felt really stupid for not seeing it sooner. Sure. I\u0027d had a lot on mymind—revenue-obsessed vampires, giant mutant wolves, a ragged hole in the center of my chest—but when I laid the evidence out, it was embarrassingly obvious. 　　Jacob avoiding me. Charlie saying he looked strange, upset. . . . Billy\u0027s vague, unhelpful answers. 　　Holy crow, I knew exactly what was going on with Jacob. 　　It was Sam Uley. Even my nightmares had been trying to tell me that. Sam had gotten to Jacob. 　　Whatever was happening to the other boys on the reservation had reached out and stolen my friend. 　　He\u0027d been sucked into Sam\u0027s cult. 　　He hadn\u0027t given up on me at all, I realized with a rush of feeling. 　　I let my truck idle in front of my house. What should I do? I weighed the dangers against each other. 　　If I went looking for Jacob, I risked the chance of Victoria or Laurent finding me with him. 　　If I didn\u0027t go after him, Sam would pull him deeper into his frightening, compulsory gang. Maybe it wouldbe too late if I didn\u0027t act soon. 　　It had been a week, and no vampires had come for me yet. A week was more than enough time for themto have returned, so I must not be a priority. Most likely, as I\u0027d decided before, they would come for meat night. The chances of them following me to La Push were much lower than the chance of losing Jacobto Sam. 　　It was worth the danger of the secluded forest road. This was no idle visit to see what was going on. Iknew what was going on. This was a rescue mission. I was going to talk to Jacob—kidnap him if I hadto. I\u0027d once seen a PBS show on deprogramming the brainwashed. There had to be some kind of cure. 　　I decided I\u0027d better call Charlie first. Maybe whatever was going on down in La Push was something thepolice should be involved in. I dashed inside, in a hurry to be on my way. 　　Charlie answered the phone it the station himself. 　　\"Chief Swan.\"\"Dad, it\u0027s Bella.\"\"What\u0027s wrong?\u0027\"I couldn\u0027t argue with his doomsday assumption this time. My voice was shaking. 　　\"I\u0027m worried about Jacob.\"\"Why?\" he asked, surprised by the unexpected topic. 　　\"I think… I think something weird is going on down at the reservation. Jacob told me about some strangestuff happening with the other boys his age. Now he\u0027s acting the same way and I\u0027m scared.\"\"What kind of stuff?\" He used his professional, police business voice. That was good; he was taking meseriously. 　　\"First he was scared, and then he was avoiding me, and now… I\u0027m afraid he\u0027s part of that bizarre gangdown there, Sam\u0027s gang. Sam Uley\u0027s gang.\"\"Sam Uley?\" Charlie repeated, surprised again. 　　 \"Yes.\"Charlie\u0027s voice was more relaxed when he answered. \"I think you\u0027ve got it wrong, Bells. Sam Uley is agreat kid. Well, he\u0027s a man now. A good son. You should hear Billy talk about him. He\u0027s really doingwonders with the youth on the reservation. He\u0027s the one who—\" Charlie broke off mid-sentence, and Iguessed that he had been about to make a reference to the night I\u0027d gotten lost in the woods. I moved onquickly. 　　\"Dad, it\u0027s not like that. Jacob was scared ofhim.\"\"Did you talk to Billy about this?\" He was trying to soothe me now. I\u0027d lost him as soon as I\u0027d mentionedSam. 　　\"Billy\u0027s not concerned.\"\"Well, Bella, then I\u0027m sure it\u0027s okay. Jacob\u0027s a kid; he was probably just messing around. I\u0027m sure he\u0027sfine. He can\u0027t spend every waking minute with you, after all.\"\"This isn\u0027t about me,\" I insisted, but the battle was lost. 　　\"I don\u0027t think you need to worry about this. Let Billy take care of Jacob.\"\"Charlie…\" My voice was starting to sound whiney. 　　\"Bells, I got a lot on my plate right now. Two tourists have gone missing off a trail outside crescent lake.\"There was an anxious edge to his voice. \"This wolf problem is getting out of hand.\"I was momentarily distracted—stunned, really—by his news. There was no way the wolves could havesurvived a match-up with Laurent…\"Are you sure that\u0027s what happened to them?\" I asked. 　　\"Afraid so, honey. There was—\" He hesitated. \"There were tracks again, and… some blood this time.\"\"Oh!\" It must not have come to a confrontation, then. Laurent must have simply outrun the wolves, butwhy? What I\u0027d seen in the meadow just got stranger and stranger—more impossible to understand. 　　\"Look, I really have to go. Don\u0027t worry about Jake, Bella. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s nothing.\"\"Fine,\" I said curtly, frustrated as his words reminded me of the more urgent crisis at hand. \"Bye.\" I hangup. 　　I stared at the phone for a long minute. What the hell, I decided. 　　Billy answered after two rings. 　　\"Hello?\"\"Hey, Billy,\" I almost growled. I tried to sound more friendly as I continued. \"Can I talk to Jacob,please?\"\"Jake\u0027s not here.\"What a shock. \"Do you know where he is?\"\"He\u0027s out with his friends.\" Billy\u0027s voice was careful. 　　 \"Oh yeah? Anyone I know? Quil?\" I could tell the words didn\u0027t come across as casually as I\u0027d meantthem to. 　　\"No,\" Billy said slowly. \"I don\u0027t think he\u0027s with Quil today.\"I knew better than to mention Sam\u0027s name. 　　\"Embry?\" I asked. 　　Billy seemed happier to answer this one. \"Yeah, he\u0027s with Embry.\"That was enough for me. Embry was one of them. 　　\"Well, have him call me when he gets in, all right?\"\"Sure, sure. No problem.\" Click. 　　\"See you soon, Billy,\" I muttered into the dead phone. 　　I drove to La Push determined to wait. I\u0027d sit out front of his house all night if I had to. I\u0027d miss school. 　　The boy was going to have to come home sometime, and when he did, he was going to have to talk tome. 　　My mind was so preoccupied that the trip I\u0027d been terrified of making seemed to take only a fewseconds. Before I was expecting it, the forest began to thin, and I knew I would soon be able to see thefirst little houses of the reservation. 　　Walking away, along the left side of the road, was a tall boy with a baseball cap. 　　My breath caught for just a moment in my throat, hopeful that luck was with me for once, and I\u0027dsrumbled across Jacob without hardly trying. But this boy was too wide, and the hair was short under thehat. Even from behind, I was sure it was Quil, though he looked bigger than the last time I\u0027d seen him. 　　What was with these Quileute boys? Were they feeding them experimental growth hormones? 　　I crossed over to the wrong side of the road to stop next to him. He looked up when the roar of mytruck approached. 　　Quil\u0027s expression frightened me more than it surprised me. His face was bleak, brooding, his foreheadcreased with worry. 　　\"Oh, hey, Bella,\" he greeted me dully. 　　\"Hi, Quil… Are you okay?\"He stared at me morosely. \"Fine.\"\"Can I give you a ride somewhere?\" I offered. 　　\"Sure, I guess,\" he mumbled. He shuffled around the front of the truck and opened the passenger door toclimbin. 　　\"Where to?\"\"My house is on the north side, back behind the store,\" he told me. 　　\"Have you seen Jacob today.\" The question burst from me almost before he\u0027d finished speaking. 　　 I looked at Quil eagerly, waiting for his answer. He stared out the windshield for a second before hespoke. \"From a distance,\" he finally said. 　　\"A distance?\" I echoed. 　　\"I tried to follow them—he was with Embry.\" His voice was low, hard to hear over the engine. I leanedcloser. \"I know they saw me. But they turned and just disappeared into the trees. I don\u0027t think they werealone—I think Sam and his crew might have been with them. 　　\"I\u0027ve been stumbling around in the forest for an hour, yelling for them. I just barely found the road againwhen you drove up.\"\"So Sam did get to him.\" The words were a little distorted—my teeth were gritted together. 　　Quil stared at me. \"You know about that.?\"I nodded. \"Jake told me… before.\"\"Before,\" Quil repeated, and sighed. 　　\"Jacob\u0027s just as bad as the others now?\"\"Never leaves Sam\u0027s side.\" Quil turned his head and spit out the open window. 　　\"And before that—did he avoid everyone? Was he acting upset?\"His voice was low and rough. \"Not for as long as the others. Maybe one day. Then Sam caught up withhim.\"\"What do you think it is? Drugs or something?\"\"I can\u0027t see Jacob or Embry getting into anything like that… but what do I know? What else could it be? 　　And why aren\u0027t the old people worried?\" He shook his head, and the fear showed in his eyes now. 　　\"Jacob didn\u0027t want to be a part of this… cult. I don\u0027t understand what could change him.\" He stared atme, his face frightened. \"I don\u0027t want to be next.\"My eyes mirrored his fear. That was the second time I\u0027d heard it described as a cult. I shivered. \"Areyour parents any help?\"He grimaced. \"Right. My grandfather\u0027s on the council with Jacob\u0027s dad. Sam Uley is the best thing thatever happened to this place, as far as he\u0027s concerned.\"We stared at each other for a prolonged moment. We were in La Push now, and my truck was barelycrawling along the empty road. I could see the village\u0027s only store not too far ahead. 　　\"I\u0027ll get out now,\" Quil said. \"My house is right over there.\" He gestured toward the small woodenrectangle behind the store. I pulled over to the shoulder, and he jumped out. 　　\"I\u0027m going to go wait for Jacob,\" I told him in a hard voice. 　　\"Good luck.\" He slammed the door and shuffled forward along the road, his head bent forward, hisshoulders slumped. 　　Quil\u0027s face haunted me as I made a wide U-turn and headed back toward the Blacks\u0027. He was terrifiedof being next. What was happening here? 　　 I stopped in front of Jacob\u0027s house, killing the motor and rolling down the windows. It was stuffy today,no breeze. I put my feet up on the dashboard and settled in to wait. 　　A movement flashed in my peripheral vision—I turned and spotted Billy looking at me through the frontwindow with a confused expression. I waved once and smiled a tight smile, but stayed where I was. 　　His eyes narrowed; he let the curtain fall across the glass. 　　I was prepared to stay as long as it took, but I wished I had something to do. I dug up a pen out of thebottom of my backpack, and an old test. I started to doodle on the back of the scrap. 　　I\u0027d only had time to scrawl one row of diamonds when there was a sharp tap against my door. 　　I jumped, looking up, expecting Billy. 　　\"What are you doing here, Bella.\u0027\" Jacob growled. 　　I stared at him in blank astonishment. 　　Jacob had changed radically in the last weeks since I\u0027d seen him. The first thing I noticed was hishair—his beautiful hair was all gone, cropped quite short, covering his head with an inky gloss like blacksatin. The planes of his face seemed to have hardened subtly, tightened… aged. His neck and hisshoulders were different, too, thicker somehow. His hands, where they gripped the window frame,looked enormous, with the tendons and veins more prominent under the russet skin. But the physicalchanges were insignificant. 　　It was his expression that made him almost completely unrecognizable. The open, friendly smile was gonelike the hair, the warmth in his dark eyes altered to a brooding resentment that was instantly disturbing. 　　There was a darkness in Jacob now. Like my sun had imploded. 　　\"Jacob?\" I whispered. 　　He just stared at me, his eyes tense and angry. 　　I realized we weren\u0027t alone. Behind him stood four others; all tall and russet-skinned, black hair choppedshort just like Jacob\u0027s. They could have been brothers—I couldn\u0027t even pick Embry out of the group. 　　The resemblance was only intensified by the strikingly similar hostility in every pair of eyes. 　　Every pair but one. The oldest by several years, Sam stood in the very back, his face serene and sure. Ihad to swallow back the bile that rose in my throat. I wanted to take a swing at him. No, I wanted to domore than that. More than anything, I wanted to be fierce and deadly, someone no one would dare messwith. Someone who would scare Sam Uley silly. 　　I wanted to be a vampire. 　　The violent desire caught me off guard and knocked the wind out of me. It was the most forbidden of allwishes—even when I only wished it for a malicious reason like this, to gain an advantage over anenemy—because it was the most painful. That future was lost to me forever, had never really been withinmy grasp. I scrambled to gain control of myself while the hole in my chest ached hollowly. 　　\"What do you want?\" Jacob demanded, his expression growing more resentful as he watched the play ofemotion across my face. 　　\"I want to talk to you,\" I said in a weak voice. I tried to focus, but I was still reeling against the escape of my taboo dream. 　　\"Go ahead,\" he hissed through his teeth. His glare was vicious. I\u0027d never seen him look at anyone likethat, least of all me. It hurt with a surprising intensity—a physical pain, a stabbing in my head. 　　\"Alone!\" I hissed, and my voice was stronger. 　　He looked behind him, and I knew where his eyes would go. Every one of them was turned for Sam\u0027sreaction. 　　Sam nodded once, his face unperturbed. He made a brief comment in an unfamiliar, liquid language—Icould only be positive that it wasn\u0027t French or Spanish, but I guessed that it was Quileute. He turned andwalked into Jacob\u0027s house. The others, Paul, Jared, and Embry, I assumed, followed him in. 　　\"Okay.\" Jacob seemed a bit less furious when the others were gone. His face was a little calmer, but alsomore hopeless. His mouth seemed permanently pulled down at the corners. 　　I took a deep breath. \"You know what I want to know.\"He didn\u0027t answer. He just stared at me bitterly. 　　I stared back and the silence stretched on. The pain in his face unnerved me. I felt a lump beginning tobuild in my throat. 　　\"Can we walk?\" I asked while I could still speak. 　　He didn\u0027t respond in any way; his face didn\u0027t change. 　　I got out of the car, feeling unseen eyes behind the windows on me, and started walking toward the treesto the north. My feet squished in the damp grass and mud beside the road, and, as that was the onlysound, at first I thought he wasn\u0027t following me. But when I glanced around, he was right beside me, hisfeet having somehow found a less noisy path than mine. 　　I felt better in the fringe of trees, where Sam couldn\u0027t possibly be watching. As we walked, I struggled forthe right thing to say, but nothing came. I just got more and more angry that Jacob had gotten suckedin… that Billy had allowed this… that Sam was able to stand there so assured and calm…Jacob suddenly picked up the pace, striding ahead of me easily with his long legs, and then swingingaround to face me, planting himself in my path so I would have to stop too. 　　I was distracted by the overt grace of his movement. Jacob had been nearly as klutzy as me with hisnever-ending growth spurt. When did that changed? 　　But Jacob didn\u0027t give me time to think about it. 　　\"Let\u0027s get this over with,\" he said in a hard, husky voice. 　　I waited. He knew what I wanted. 　　\"It\u0027s not what you think.\" His voice was abruptly weary. \"It\u0027s not what I thought—I was way off.\"\"So what is it, then?\"He studied my face for a long moment, speculating. The anger never completely left his eyes. \"I can\u0027t tellyou,\" he finally said. 　　 My jaw tightened, and I spoke through my teeth. \"I thought we were friends.\"\"We were.\" There was a slight emphasis on the past tense. 　　\"But you don\u0027t need friends anymore,\" I said sourly. \"You have Sam. Isn\u0027t that nice—you\u0027ve alwayslooked up to him so much.\"\"I didn\u0027t understand him before.\"\"And now you\u0027ve seen the light. Hallelujah.\"\"It wasn\u0027t like I thought it was. This isn\u0027t Sam\u0027s fault. He\u0027s helping me as much as he can.\" His voiceturned brittle and he looked over my head, past me, rage burning out from his eyes. 　　\"He\u0027s helping you,\" I repeated dubiously. \"Naturally.\"But Jacob didn\u0027t seem to be listening. He was taking deep, deliberate breaths, trying to calm himself. Hewas so mad that his hands were shaking. 　　\"Jacob, please,\" I whispered \"Won\u0027t you tell me what happened? Maybe I can help.\"\"No one can help me now.\" The words were a low moan; his voice broke. 　　\"What did he do to you?\" I demanded, tears collecting in my eyes. I reached out to him, as I had oncebefore, stepping forward with my arms wide. 　　This time he cringed away, holding his hands up defensively. \"Don\u0027t touch me,\" he whispered. 　　\"Is Sam catching?\" I mumbled. The stupid tears had escaped the corners of my eyes. I wiped them awaywith the back of my hand, and folded my arms across my chest. 　　\"Stop blaming Sam.\" The words came out fast, like a reflex. His hands reached up to twist around thehair that was no longer there, and then fell limply at his sides. 　　\"Then who should I blame?\" I retorted. 　　He halfway smiled; it was a bleak, twisted thing. 　　\"You don\u0027t want to hear that.\"\"The hell I don\u0027t!\" I snapped. \"I want to know, and I want to know now.\"\"You\u0027re wrong,\" he snapped back. 　　\"Don\u0027t you dare tell me I\u0027m wrong—I\u0027m not the one who got brainwashed! Tell me now whose fault thisall is, if it\u0027s not your precious Sam!\"\"You asked for it,\" he growled at me, eyes glinting hard. \"If you want to blame someone, why don\u0027t youpoint your finger at those filthy, reeking bloodsuckers that you love so much?\"My mouth fell open and my breath came out with a whooshing sound. I was frozen in place, stabbedthrough with his double-edged words. The pain twisted in familiar patterns through my body, the jaggedhole ripping me open from the inside out, but it was second place, background music to the chaos of mythoughts. I couldn\u0027t believe that I\u0027d heard him correctly. There was no trace of indecision in his face. Onlyfury. 　　 My mouth still hung wide. 　　\"I told you that you didn\u0027t want to hear it,\" he said. 　　\"I don\u0027t understand who you mean,\" I whispered. 　　He raised one eyebrow in disbelief. \"I think you understand exactly who I mean. You\u0027re not going tomake me say it, are you? I don\u0027t like hurting you.\"\"I don\u0027t understand who you mean,\" I repeated mechanically. 　　\"The Cullens,\" he said slowly, drawing out the word, scrutinizing my face as he spoke it. \"I saw that—Ican see in your eyes what it does to you when I say their name.\"I shook my head back and forth in denial, trying to clear it at the same time. How did he know this? Andhow did it have anything to do with Sam\u0027s cult? Was it a gang of vampire-haters? What was the point offorming such a society when no vampires lived in Forks anymore? Why would Jacob start believing thestories about the Cullens now, when the evidence of them was long gone, never to return? 　　It took me too long to come up with the correct response. \"Don\u0027t tell me you\u0027re listening to Billy\u0027ssuperstitious nonsense now,\" I said with a feeble attempt at mockery. 　　\"He knows more than I gave him credit for.\"\"Be serious, Jacob.\"He glared at me, his eyes critical. 　　\"Superstitions aside,\" I said quickly. \"I still don\u0027t see what you\u0027re accusing the... Cullens\"—wince—\"of. 　　They left more than half a year ago. How can you blame them for what Sam is doing now?\"\"Sam isn\u0027t doing anything, Bella. And I know they\u0027re gone. But sometimes… things are set in motion, andthen it\u0027s too late.\"\"What\u0027s set in motion? What\u0027s too late? What are you blaming them for?\"He was suddenly right in my face, his fury glowing in his eyes. \"For existing,\" he hissed. 　　I was surprised and distracted as the warning words came in Edward\u0027s voice again, when I wasn\u0027t evenscared. 　　\"Quiet now, Bella. Don\u0027t push him,\" Edward cautioned in my ear. 　　Ever since Edward\u0027s name had broken through the careful walls I\u0027d buried it behind, I\u0027d been unable tolock it up again. It didn\u0027t hurt now—not during the precious seconds when I could hear his voice. 　　Jacob was fuming in front of me, quivering with anger. 　　I didn\u0027t understand why the Edward delusion was unexpectedly in my mind. Jacob was livid, but he wasJacob. There was no adrenaline, no danger. 　　\"Give him a chance to calm down,\" Edward\u0027s voice insisted. 　　I shook my head in confusion. \"You\u0027re being ridiculous,\" I told them both. 　　\"Fine,\" Jacob answered, breathing deeply again. \"I won\u0027t argue it with you. It doesn\u0027t matter anyway, the damage is done.\"\"What damage?\"He didn\u0027t flinch as I shouted the words in his face. 　　\"Let\u0027s head back. There\u0027s nothing more to say.\"I gaped. \"There\u0027s everything more to say! You haven\u0027t said anything yet!\"He walked past me, striding back toward the house. 　　\"I ran into Quil today,\" I yelled after him. 　　He paused midstep, but didn\u0027t turn. 　　\"You remember your friend, Quil? Yeah, he\u0027s terrified.\"Jacob whirled to face me. His expression was pained. \"Quil\" was all he said. 　　\"He\u0027s worried about you, too. He\u0027s freaked out.\"Jacob stared past me with desperate eyes. 　　I goaded him further. \"He\u0027s frightened that he\u0027s next.\"Jacob clutched at a tree for support, his face turning a strange shade of green under the red-brownsurface. \"He won\u0027t be next,\" Jacob muttered to himself. \"He can\u0027t be. It\u0027s over now. This shouldn\u0027t still behappening. Why? Why?\" His fist slammed against the tree. It wasn\u0027t a big tree, slender and only a fewfeet taller than Jacob. But it still surprised me when tht trunk gave way and snapped off loudly under hisblows. 　　Jacob stared at the sharp, broken point with shock that quickly turned to horror. 　　\"I have to get back.\" He whirled and stalked away so swiftly that I had to jog to keep up. 　　\"Back to Sam!\"\"That\u0027s one way of looking at it,\" it sounded like he said. He was mumbling and facing away. 　　I chased him back to the truck. \"Wait!\" I called as he turned toward the house. 　　He spun around to face me, and I saw that his hands were shaking again. 　　\"Go home, Bella. I can\u0027t hang out with you anymore.\"The silly, inconsequential hurt was incredibly potent. The tears welled up again. \"Are you… breaking upwith me?\" The words were all wrong, but they were the best way I could think to phrase what I wasasking. After all, what Jake and I had was more than any schoolyard romance. Stronger. 　　He barked out a bitter laugh. \"Hardly. If that were the case, I\u0027d say \u0027Let\u0027s stay friends.\u0027 I can\u0027t even saythat.\"\"Jacob… why? Sam won\u0027t let you have other friends? Please, Jake. You promised. I need you!\" Theblank emptiness of my life before—before Jacob brought some semblance of reason back intoit—reared up and confronted me. Loneliness choked in my throat. 　　 \"I\u0027m sorry, Bella,\" Jacob said each word distinctly in a cold voice that didn\u0027t seem to belong to him. 　　I didn\u0027t believe that this was really what Jacob wanted to say. It seemed like there was something elsetrying to be said through his angry eyes, but I couldn\u0027t understand the message. 　　Maybe this wasn\u0027t about Sam at all. Maybe this had nothing to do with the Cullens. Maybe he was justtrying to pull himself out of a hopeless situation. Maybe I should let him do that, if that\u0027s what was best forhim. I should do that. It would be right. 　　But I heard my voice escaping in a whisper. 　　\"I\u0027m sorry that I couldn\u0027t… before… I wish I could change how I feel about you, Jacob.\" I wasdesperate, reaching, stretching the truth so far that it curved nearly into the shape of a lie. \"Maybe…maybe I would change,\" I whispered. \"Maybe, if you gave me some time… just don\u0027t quit on me now,Jake. I can\u0027t take it.\"His face went from anger to agony in a second. One shaking hand reached out toward me. 　　\"No. Don\u0027t think like that, Bella, please. Don\u0027t blame yourself, don\u0027t think this is your fault. This one is allme. I swear, it\u0027s not about you.\"\"It\u0027s not you, it\u0027s me,\" I whispered. \"There\u0027s a new one.\"\"I mean it, Bella. I\u0027m not…\" he struggled, his voice going even huskier as he fought to control his emotion. 　　His eyes were tortured. \"I\u0027m not good enough to be your friend anymore, or anything else. I\u0027m not what Iwas before. I\u0027m not good.\"\"What?\" I stared at him, confused and appalled. \"What are you saying? You\u0027re much better than I am,Jake. You are good! Who told you that you aren\u0027t? Sam? It\u0027s a vicious lie, Jacob! Don\u0027t let him tell youthat!\" I was suddenly yelling again. 　　Jacob\u0027s face went hard and flat. \"No one had to tell me anything. I know what I am.\"\"You\u0027re my friend, that\u0027s what you are! Jake—don\u0027t!\"He was backing away from me. 　　\"I\u0027m sorry, Bella,\" he said again; this time it was a broken mumble. He turned and almost ran into thehouse. 　　I was unable to move from where I stood. I stared at the little house; it looked too small to hold fourlarge boys and two larger men. There was no reaction inside. No flutter at the edge of the curtain, nosound of voices or movement. It faced me vacantly. 　　The rain started to drizzle, stinging here and there against my skin. I couldn\u0027t take my eyes off the house. 　　Jacob would come back. He had to. 　　The rain picked up, and so did the wind. The drops were no longer falling from above; they slanted at anangle from the west. I could smell the brine from the ocean. My hair whipped in my face, sticking to thewet places and tangling in my lashes. I waited. 　　Finally the door opened, and I took a step forward in relief. 　　Billy rolled his chair into the door frame. I could see no one behind him. 　　 \"Charlie just called, Bella. I told him you were on your way home.\" His eyes were full of pity. 　　The pity made it final somehow. I didn\u0027t comment. I just turned robotically and climbed in my truck. I\u0027dleft the windows open and the seats were slick and wet. It didn\u0027t matter. I was already soaked. 　　Not as bad! Not as bad! my mind tried to comfort me. It was true. This wasn\u0027t as bad. This wasn\u0027t theend of the world, not again. This was just the end of what little peace there was left behind. That was all. 　　Not as bad, I agreed, then added, but bad enough. 　　I\u0027d thought Jake had been healing the hole in me—or at least plugging it up, keeping it from hurting me somuch. I\u0027d been wrong. He\u0027d just been carving out his own hole, so that I was now riddled through likeSwiss cheese. I wondered why I didn\u0027t crumble into pieces. 　　Charlie was waiting on the porch. As I rolled to a stop, he walked out to meet me. 　　\"Billy called. He said you got in fight with Jake—said you were pretty upset,\" he explained as he openedmy door for me. 　　Then he looked at my face. A kind of horrified recognition registered in his expression. I tried to feel myface from the inside out, to know what he was seeing. My face felt empty and cold, and I realized what itwould remind him of. 　　\"That\u0027s not exactly how it happened,\" I muttered. 　　Charlie put his arm around me and helped me out of the car. He didn\u0027t comment on my sodden clothes. 　　\"Then what did happen\u0027\" he asked when we were inside. He pulled the afghan off the back of the sofa ashe spoke and wrapped it around my shoulders. I realized I was shivering still. 　　My voice was lifeless. \"Sam Uley says Jacob can\u0027t be my friend anymore.\"Charlie shot me a strange look. \"Who told you that?\"\"Jacob,\" I stated, though that wasn\u0027t exactly what he\u0027d said. It was still true. 　　Charlie\u0027s eyebrows pulled together. \"You really think there\u0027s something wrong with the Uley kid?\"\"I know there is. Jacob wouldn\u0027t tell me what, though.\" I could hear the water from my clothes drippingto the floor and splashing on the linoleum. \"I\u0027m going to go change.\"Charlie was lost in thought. \"Okay,\" he said absently. 　　I decided to take a shower because I was so cold, but the hot water didn\u0027t seem to affect thetemperature of my skin. I was still freezing when I gave up and shut the water off. In the sudden quiet, Icould hear Charlie talking to someone downstairs. I wrapped a towel around me, and cracked thebathroom door. 　　Charlie\u0027s voice was angry. \"I\u0027m not buying that. It doesn\u0027t make any sense.\"It was quiet then, and I realized he was on the phone. A minute passed. 　　\"Don\u0027t you put this on Bella!\" Charlie suddenly shouted. 　　I jumped. When he spoke again, his voice was careful and lower. \"Bella\u0027s made it very clear all along that she and Jacob were just friends… Well, if that was it, then why didn\u0027t you say so at first? No, Billy, Ithink she\u0027s right about this… Because I know my daughter, and if she says Jacob was scared before—\"He was cut off mid-sentence, and when he answered he was almost shouting again. 　　\"What do you mean I don\u0027t know my daughter as well as I think I do!\" He listened for a brief second,and his response was almost too low for me to hear. \"If you think I\u0027m going to remind her about that, thenyou had better think again. She\u0027s only just starting to get over it, and mostly because of Jacob, I think. Ifwhatever Jacob has going on with this Sam character sends her back into that depression, then Jacob isgoing to have to answer to me. You\u0027re my friend, Billy, but this is hurting my family.\"There was another break for Billy to respond. 　　\"You got that right—those boys set one toe out of line and I\u0027m going to know about it. We\u0027ll be keepingan eye on the situation, you can be sure of that.\" He was no longer Charlie; he was Chief Swan now. 　　\"Fine. Yeah. Goodbye.\" The phone slammed into the cradle. 　　I tiptoed quickly across the hall into my room. Charlie was muttering angrily in the kitchen. 　　So Billy was going to blame me. I was leading Jacob on and he\u0027d finally had enough. 　　It was strange, for I\u0027d feared that myself, but after the last thing Jacob had said this afternoon, I didn\u0027tbelieve it anymore. There was much more to this than an unrequited crush, and it surprised me that Billywould stoop to claiming that. It made me think that whatever secret they were keeping was bigger thanI\u0027d been imagining. At least Charlie was on my side now. 　　I put my pajamas on and crawled into bed. Life seemed dark enough at the moment chat I let myselfcheat. The hole—holes now—were already aching, so why not? I pulled out the memory—nor a realmemory that would hurt too much, but the false memory of Edward\u0027s voice in my mind thisafternoon—and played it over and over in my head until I fell asleep with the tears still streaming calmlydown my empty face. 　　It was a new dream tonight. Rain was falling and Jacob was walking soundlessly beside me, thoughbeneath my feet the ground crunched like dry gravel. But he wasn\u0027t my Jacob; he was the new, bitter,graceful Jacob. The smooth suppleness of his walk reminded me of someone else, and, as I watched, hisfeatures started to change. The russet color of his skin leached away, leaving his face pale white likebone. His eyes turned gold, and then crimson, and then back to gold again. His shorn hair twisted in thebreeze, turning bronze where the wind touched it. And his face became so beautiful that it shattered myheart. I reached for him, but he took a step away, raising his hands like a shield. And then Edwardvanished. 　　I wasn\u0027t sure, when I woke in the dark, if I\u0027d just begun crying, or if my tears had run while I slept andsimply continued now. I stared at my dark ceiling. I could feel that it was the middle of the night—I wasstill half-asleep, maybe more than half. I closed my eyes wearily and prayed for a dreamless sleep.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/144/5929.html","bookId":339,"book":{"id":339,"title":"暮光之城：新月 New Moon","description":"简介： Edward and his family leave Forks because he believes he is endangering Bella\u0027s life.
