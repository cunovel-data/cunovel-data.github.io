{"id":13600,"no":20,"title":"Chapter 20 Volterra","content":"WE BEGAN THE STEEP CLIMB, AND THE ROAD GREW CONGESTED. As we wound higher,the cars became too close together for Alice to weave insanely between them anymore. We slowed to acrawl behind a little tan Peugeot.\n 　　\"Alice,\" I moaned. The clock on the dash seemed to be speeding up.\n 　　\"It\u0027s the only way in,\" she tried soothe me. But her voice was too strained to comfort.\n 　　The cars continued to edge forward, one car length at a time. The sun beamed down brilliantly, seemingalready overhead.\n 　　The cars crept one by one toward the city. As we got closer, I could see cars parked by the side of theroad with people getting out to walk the test of the way. At first I thought it was justimpatience—something I could easily understand. But then we came around a switchback, and I could see the filled parking lot outside the city wall, the crowds of people walking through the gates. No onewas being allowed to drive through.\n 　　\"Alice,\" I whispered urgently.\n 　　\"I know,\" she said. Her face was chiseled from ice.\n 　　Now that I was looking, and we were crawling slowly enough to see, I could tell that it was very windy.\n 　　The people crowding toward the gate gripped their hats and tugged their hair out of their faces. Theirclothes billowed around them. I also noticed that the color red was everywhere. Red shirts, red hats, redflags dripping like long ribbons beside the gate, whipping in the wind—as I watched, the brilliant crimsonscarf one woman had tied around her hair was caught in a sudden gust. It twisted up into the air aboveher, writhing like it was alive. She reached for it, jumping in the air, but it continued to flutter higher, apatch of bloody color against the dull, ancient walls.\n 　　\"Bella.\" Alice spoke quickly in a fierce, low voice. \"I can\u0027t see what the guard here will decide now—ifthis doesn\u0027t work, you\u0027re going to have to go in alone. You\u0027re going to have to run. Just keep asking forthe Palazzo dei Priori, and running in the direction they tell you. Don\u0027t get lost.\"\"Palazzo dei Priori, Palazzo dei Priori,\" I repeated the name over and over again, trying to get it down.\n 　　\"Or \u0027the clock tower,\u0027 if they speak English. I\u0027ll go around and try to find a secluded spot somewherebehind the city where I can go over the wall.\"I nodded. \"Palazzo dei Priori.\"\"Edward will be under the clock tower, to the north of the square. There\u0027s a narrow alleyway on theright, and he\u0027ll be in the shadow there. You have to get his attention before he can move into the sun.\"I nodded furiously.\n 　　Alice was near the front of the line. A man in a navy blue uniform was directing the flow of traffic, turningthe cars away from the full lot. They U-turned and headed back to find a place beside the road. Then itwas Alice\u0027s turn.\n 　　The uniformed man motioned lazily, not paying attention. Alice accelerated, edging around him andheading for the gate. He shouted something at us, but held his ground, waving frantically to keep the nextcar from following our bad example.\n 　　The man at the gate wore a matching uniform. As we approached him, the throngs of tourists passed,crowding the sidewalks, staring curiously at the pushy, flashy Porsche.\n 　　The guard stepped into the middle of the street. Alice angled the car carefully before she came to a fullstop. The sun beat against my window, and she was in shadow. She swiftly reached behind the seat andgrabbed something from her bag.\n 　　The guard came around the car with an irritated expression, and tapped on her window angrily.\n 　　She rolled the window down halfway, and I watched him do a double take when he saw the face behindthe dark glass.\n 　　\"I\u0027m sorry, only tour buses allowed in the city today, miss,\" he said in English, with a heavy accent. Hewas apologetic, now, as if he wished he had better news for the strikingly beautiful woman.\n 　　 \"It\u0027s a private tour,\" Alice said, flashing an alluring smile. She reached her hand out cf the window, intothe sunlight. I froze, until I realized she was wearing an elbow-length, tan glove. She took his hand, stillraised from tapping her window, and pulled it into the car. She put something into his palm, and foldedhis fingers around it.\n 　　His face was dazed as he retrieved his hand and stared at the thick roll of money he now held. Theoutside bill was a thousand dollar bill.\n 　　\"Is this a joke?\" he mumbled.\n 　　Alice\u0027s smile was blinding. \"Only if you think it\u0027s funny.\"He looked at her, his eyes staring wide. I glanced nervously at the clock on the dash. If Edward stuck tohis plan, we had only five minutes left.\n 　　\"I\u0027m in a wee bit of a hurry,\" she hinted, still smiling.\n 　　The guard blinked twice, and then shoved the money inside his vest. He took a step away from thewindow and waved us on. None of the passing people seemed to notice the quiet exchange. Alice droveinto the city, and we both sighed in relief.\n 　　The street was very narrow, cobbled with the same color stones as the faded cinnamon brown buildingsthat darkened the street with their shade. It had the feel of an alleyway. Red flags decorated the walls,spaced only a few yards apart, flapping in the wind that whistled through the narrow lane.\n 　　It was crowded, and the foot traffic slowed our progress.\n 　　\"Just a little farther,\" Alice encouraged me; I was gripping the door handle, ready to throw myself into thestreet as soon as she spoke the word.\n 　　She drove in quick spurts and sudden stops, and the people in the crowd shook their fists at us and saidangry words that I was glad I couldn\u0027t understand. She turned onto a little path that couldn\u0027t have beenmeant for cars; shocked people had to squeeze into doorways as we scraped by. We found anotherstreet at the end. The buildings were taller here; they leaned together overhead so that no sunlighttouched the pavement—the thrashing red flags on either side nearly met. The crowd was thicker herethan anywhere else. Alice stopped the car. I had the door open before we were at a standstill.\n 　　She pointed to where the street widened into a patch of bright openness. \"There—we\u0027re at the southernend of the square. Run straight across, to the right of the clock tower. I\u0027ll find a way around—\"Her breath caught suddenly, and when she spoke again, her voice was a hiss. \"They\u0027re everywhere?\"I froze in place, but she pushed me out of the car. \"Forget about them. You have two minutes. Go, Bella,go!\" she shouted, climbing out of the car as she spoke.\n 　　I didn\u0027t pause to watch Alice melt into the shadows. I didn\u0027t stop to close my door behind me. I shoved aheavy woman out of my way and ran flat out, head down, paying little attention to anything but theuneven stones beneath my feet.\n 　　Coming out of the dark lane, I was blinded by the brilliant sunlight beating down into the principal plaza.\n 　　The wind whooshed into me, flinging my hair into my eyes and blinding me further. It was no wonder thatI didn\u0027t see the wall of flesh until I\u0027d smacked into it.\n 　　There was no pathway, no crevice between the close pressed bodies. I pushed against them furiously, fighting the hands that shoved back. I heard exclamations of irritation and even pain as I battled my waythrough, but none were in a language I understood. The faces were a blur of anger and surprise,surrounded by the ever-present red. A blond woman scowled at me, and the red scarf coiled around herneck looked like a gruesome wound. A child, lifted on a man\u0027s shoulders to see over the crowd, grinneddown at me, his lips distended over a set of plastic vampire fangs.\n 　　The throng jostled around me, spinning me the wrong direction. I was glad the clock was so visible, orI\u0027d never keep my course straight. But both hands on the clock pointed up toward the pitiless sun, and,though I shoved viciously against the crowd, I knew I was too late. I wasn\u0027t halfway across. I wasn\u0027tgoing to make it. I was stupid and slow and human, and we were all going to die because of it.\n 　　I hoped Alice would get out. I hoped that she would see me from some dark shadow and know that Ihad failed, so she could go home to Jasper.\n 　　I listened, above the angry exclamations, trying to hear the sound of discovery: the gasp, maybe thescream, as Edward came into someone\u0027s view.\n 　　But there was a break in the crowd—I could see a bubble of space ahead. I pushed urgently toward it,not realizing till I bruised my shins against the bricks that there was a wide, square fountain set into thecenter of the plaza.\n 　　I was nearly crying with relief as I flung my leg over the edge and ran through the knee-deep water. Itsprayed all around me as I thrashed my way across the pool. Even in the sun, the wind was glacial, andthe wet made the cold actually painful. But the fountain was very wide; it let me cross the center of thesquare and then some in mere seconds. I didn\u0027t pause when I hit the far edge—I used the low wall as aspringboard, throwing myself into the crowd.\n 　　They moved more readily for me now, avoiding the icy water that splattered from my dripping clothes asI ran. I glanced up at the clock again.\n 　　A deep, booming chime echoed through the square. It throbbed in the stones under my feet. Childrencried, covering their ears. And I started screaming as I ran.\n 　　\"Edward!\" I screamed, knowing it was useless. The crowd was too loud, and my voice was breathlesswith exertion. But I couldn\u0027t stop screaming.\n 　　The clock tolled again. I ran past a child in his mother\u0027s arms—his hair was almost white in the dazzlingsunlight. A circle of tall men, all wearing red blazers, called out warnings as I barreled through them. Theclock tolled again.\n 　　On the other side of the men in blazers, there was a break in the throng, space between the sightseerswho milled aimlessly around me. My eyes searched the dark narrow passage to the right of the widesquare edifice under the tower. I couldn\u0027t see the street level—there were still too many people in theway. The clock tolled again.\n 　　It was hard to see now. Without the crowd to break the wind, it whipped at my face and burned myeyes. I couldn\u0027t be sure if that was the reason behind my tears, or if I was crying in defeat as the clocktolled again.\n 　　A little family of four stood nearest to the alley\u0027s mouth. The two girls wore crimson dresses, withmatching ribbons tying their dark hair back. The father wasn\u0027t tall. It seemed like I could see somethingbright in the shadows, just over his shoulder. I hurtled toward them, trying to see past the stinging tears.\n 　　The clock tolled, and the littlest girl clamped her hands over her ears.\n 　　 The older girl, just waist high on her mother, hugged her mother\u0027s leg and stared into the shadows behindthem. As I watched, she tugged on her mother\u0027s elbow and pointed toward the darkness. The clocktolled, and I was so close now.\n 　　I was close enough to hear her high-pitched voice. Her father stared at me in surprise as I bore down onthem, rasping out Edward\u0027s name over and over again.\n 　　The older girl giggled and said something to her mother, gesturing toward the shadows again impatiently.\n 　　I swerved around the father—he clutched the baby out of my way—and sprinted for the gloomy breachbehind them as the clock tolled over my head.\n 　　\"Edward, no!\" I screamed, but my voice was lost in the roar of the chime.\n 　　I could see him now. And I could see that he could not see me.\n 　　It was really him, no hallucination this time. And I realized that my delusions were more flawed than I\u0027drealized; they\u0027d never done him justice.\n 　　Edward stood, motionless as a statue, just a few feet from the mouth of the alley. His eyes were closed,the rings underneath them deep purple, his arms relaxed at his sides, his palms turned forward. Hisexpression was very peaceful, like he was dreaming pleasant things. The marble skin of his chest wasbare—there was a small pile of white fabric at his feet. The light reflecting from the pavement of thesquare gleamed dimly from his skin.\n 　　I\u0027d never seen anything more beautiful—even as I ran, gasping and screaming, I could appreciate that.\n 　　And the last seven months meant nothing. And his words in the forest meant nothing. And it did notmatter if he did not want me. I would never want anything but him, no matter how long I lived.\n 　　The clock tolled, and he took a large stride toward the light.\n 　　\"No!\" I screamed. \"Edward, look at me!\"He wasn\u0027t listening. He smiled very slightly. He raised his foot to take the step that would put him directlyin the path of the sun.\n 　　I slammed into him so hard that the force would have hurled me to the ground if his arms hadn\u0027t caughtme and held me up. It knocked my breath out of me and snapped my head back.\n 　　His dark eyes opened slowly as the clock tolled again.\n 　　He looked down at me with quiet surprise.\n 　　\"Amazing,\" he said, his exquisite voice full of wonder, slightly amused. \"Carlisle was right.\"\"Edward,\" I tried to gasp, but my voice had no sound. \"You\u0027ve got to get back into the shadows. Youhave to move!\"He seemed bemused. His hand brushed softly against my cheek. He didn\u0027t appear to notice that I wastrying to force him back. I could have been pushing against the alley walls for all the progress I wasmaking. The clock tolled, but he didn\u0027t react.\n 　　It was very strange, for I knew we were both in mortal danger. Still, in that instant, I felt well. Whole. Icould feel my heart racing in my chest, the blood pulsing hot and fast through my veins again. My lungsfilled deep with the sweet scent that came off his skin. It was like there had never been any hole in my chest. I was perfect—not healed, but as if there had been no wound in the first place.\n 　　\"I can\u0027t believe how quick it was. I didn\u0027t feel a thing—they\u0027re very good,\" he mused, closing his eyesagain and pressing his lips against my hair. His voice was like honey and velvet. \"Death, that hathsucked the honey of thy breath, hath had no power yet upon thy beauty,\" he murmured, and Irecognized the line spoken by Romeo in the tomb. The clock boomed out its final chime \"You smell justexactly the same as always,\" he went on. \"So maybe this is hell. I don\u0027t care. I\u0027ll take it.\"\"I\u0027m not dead,\" I interrupted. \"And neither are you! Please Edward, we have to move. They can\u0027t be faraway!\"I struggled in his arms, and his brow furrowed in confusion.\n 　　\"What was that?\" he asked politely.\n 　　\"We\u0027re not dead, not yet! But we have to get out of here before the Volturi—\"Comprehension flickered on his face as I spoke. Before I could finish, he suddenly yanked me awayfrom the edge of the shadows, spinning me effortlessly so that my back was tight against the brick wall,and his back was to me as he faced away into the alley. His arms spread wide, protectively, in front ofme.\n 　　I peeked under his arm to see two dark shapes detach themselves from the gloom.\n 　　\"Greetings, gentlemen,\" Edward\u0027s voice was calm and pleasant, on the surface. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll berequiring your services today. I would appreciate it very much, however, if you would send my thanks toyour masters.\"\"Shall we take this conversation to a more appropriate venue?\" a smooth voice whispered menacingly.\n 　　\"I don\u0027t believe that will be necessary.\" Edward\u0027s voice was harder now. \"I know your instructions, Felix.\n 　　I haven\u0027t broken any rules.\"\"Felix merely meant to point out the proximity of the sun,\" the other shadow said in a soothing tone. Theywere both concealed within smoky gray cloaks that reached to the ground and undulated in the wind.\n 　　\"Let us seek better cover.\"\"I\u0027ll be right behind you,\" Edward said dryly. \"Bella, why don\u0027t you go back to the square and enjoy thefestival?\"\"No, bring the girl,\" the first shadow said, somehow injecting a leer into his whisper.\n 　　\"I don\u0027t think so.\" The pretense of civility disappeared. Edward\u0027s voice was flat and icy. His weightshifted infinitesimally, and I could see that he was preparing to fight.\n 　　\"No.\" I mouthed the word.\n 　　\"Shh,\" he murmured, only for me.\n 　　\"Felix,\" the second, more reasonable shadow cautioned. \"Not here.\" He turned to Edward. \"Aro wouldsimply like to speak with you again, if you have decided not to force our hand after all.\"\"Certainly,\" Edward agreed. \u0027\"But the girl goes free.\"\"I\u0027m afraid that\u0027s not possible,\" the polite shadow said regretfully. \"We do have rules to obey.\" \"Then I\u0027m afraid that I\u0027ll be unable to accept Aro\u0027s invitation, Demetri.\"\"That\u0027s just fine,\" Felix purred. My eyes were adjusting to the deep shade, and I could see that Felix wasvery big, tall and thick through the shoulders. His size reminded me of Emmett.\n 　　\"Aro will be disappointed,\" Demetri sighed.\n 　　\"I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll survive the letdown,\" Edward replied.\n 　　Felix and Demetri stole closer toward the mouth of the alley, spreading out slightly so they could come atEdward from two sides. They meant to force him deeper into the alley, to avoid a scene. No reflectedlight found access to their skin; they were safe inside their cloaks.\n 　　Edward didn\u0027t move an inch. He was dooming himself by protecting me.\n 　　Abruptly, Edward\u0027s head whipped around, toward the darkness of the winding alley, and Demetri andFelix did the same, in response to some sound or movement too subtle for my senses.\n 　　\"Let\u0027s behave ourselves, shall we?\" a lilting voice suggested. \"There are ladies present.\"Alice tripped lightly to Edward\u0027s side, her stance casual. There was no hint of any underlying tension. Shelooked so tiny, so fragile. Her little arms swung like a child\u0027s.\n 　　Yet Demetri and Felix both straightened up, their cloaks swirling slightly as a gust of wind funneledthrough the alley. Felix\u0027s face soured. Apparently, they didn\u0027t like even numbers.\n 　　\"We\u0027re not alone,\" she reminded them.\n 　　Demetri glanced over his shoulder. A few yards into the square, the little family, with the girls in their reddresses, was watching us. The mother was speaking urgently to her husband, her eyes on the five of us.\n 　　She looked away when Demetri met her gaze. The man walked a few steps farther into the plaza, andtapped one of the red-blazered men on the shoulder.\n 　　Demetri shook his head. \"Please, Edward, let\u0027s be reasonable,\" he said.\n 　　\"Let\u0027s,\" Edward agreed. \"And we\u0027ll leave quietly now, with no one the wiser.\"Demetri sighed in frustration. \"At least let us discuss this more privately.\"Six men in red now joined the family as they watched us with anxious expressions. I was very consciousof Edward\u0027s protective stance in front of me—sure that this was what caused their alarm. I wanted toscream to them to run.\n 　　Edward\u0027s teeth came together audibly. \"No.\"Felix smiled.\n 　　\"Enough.\"The voice was high, reedy, and n came from behind us.\n 　　I peeked under Edward\u0027s other arm to see a small, dark shape coming toward us. By the way the edgesbillowed, I knew it would be another one of them. Who else?\n 　　At first I thought it was a young boy. The newcomer was as tiny as Alice, with lank, pale brown hair trimmed short. The body under the cloak—which was darker, almost black—was slim and androgynous.\n 　　But the face was too pretty for a boy. The wide-eyed, full-lipped face would make a Botticelli angel looklike a gargoyle. Even allowing for the dull crimson irises.\n 　　Her size was so insignificant that the reaction to her appearance confused me. Felix and Demetri relaxedimmediately, stepping back from their offensive positions to blend again with the shadows of theoverhanging walls.\n 　　Edward dropped his arms and relaxed his position as well—but in defeat.\n 　　\"Jane,\" he sighed in recognition and resignation.\n 　　Alice folded her arms across her chest, her expression impassive.\n 　　\"Follow me,\" Jane spoke again, her childish voice a monotone. She turned her back on us and driftedsilently into the dark.\n 　　Felix gestured for us to go first, smirking.\n 　　Alice walked after the little Jane at once. Edward wrapped his arm around my waist and pulled me alongbeside her. The alley angled slightly downward as it narrowed. I looked up at him with frantic questionsin my eyes, but he just shook his head. Though I couldn\u0027t hear the others behind us, I was sure they werethere.\n 　　\"Well, Alice,\" Edward said conversationally as we walked. \"I suppose I shouldn\u0027t be surprised to see youhere.\"\"It was my mistake,\" Alice answered in the same tone. \"It was my job to set it right.\"\"What happened?\" His voice was polite, as if he were barely interested. I imagined this was due to thelistening ears behind us.\n 　　\"It\u0027s a long story.\" Alice\u0027s eyes flickered toward me and away. \"In summary, she did jump off a cliff, butshe wasn\u0027t trying to kill herself. Bella\u0027s all about the extreme sports these days.\"I flushed and turned my eyes straight ahead, looking after the dark shadow that I could no longer see. Icould imagine what he was hearing in Alice\u0027s thoughts now. Near-drownings, stalking vampires,werewolf friends…\"Hm,\" Edward said curtly, and the casual tone of his voice was gone.\n 　　There was a loose curve to the alley, still slanting downward, so I didn\u0027t see the squared-off dead endcoming until we reached the flat, windowless, brick face. The little one called Jane was nowhere to beseen.\n 　　Alice didn\u0027t hesitate, didn\u0027t break pace as she strode toward the wall. Then, with easy grace, she sliddown an open hole in the street.\n 　　It looked like a drain, sunk into the lowest point of the paving. I hadn\u0027t noticed it until Alice disappeared,but the grate was halfway pushed aside. The hole was small, and black.\n 　　I balked.\n 　　\"It\u0027s all right, Bella,\" Edward said in a low voice. \"Alice will catch you.\" I eyed the hole doubtfully. I imagine he would have gone first, if Demetri and Felix hadn\u0027t been waiting,smug and silent, behind us.\n 　　I crouched down, swinging my legs into the narrow gap.\n 　　\"Alice?\" I whispered, voice trembling.\n 　　\"I\u0027m right here, Bella,\" she reassured me. Her voice came from too far below to make me feel better.\n 　　Edward took my wrists—his hands felt like stones in winter—and lowered me into the blackness.\n 　　\"Ready?\" he asked.\n 　　\"Drop her,\" Alice called.\n 　　I closed my eyes so I couldn\u0027t see the darkness, scrunching them together in terror, clamping my mouthshut so I wouldn\u0027t scream. Edward let me fall.\n 　　It was silent and short. The air whipped past me for just half a second, and then, with a huff as I exhaled,Alice\u0027s waiting arms caught me.\n 　　I was going to have bruises; her arms were very hard. She stood me upright.\n 　　It was dim, but not black at the bottom. The light from the hole above provided a faint glow, reflectingwetly from the stones under my feet. The light vanished for a second, and then Edward was a faint, whiteradiance beside me. He put his arm around me, holding me close to his side, and began to tow me swiftlyforward. I wrapped both arms around his cold waist, and tripped and stumbled my way across theuneven stone surface. The sound of the heavy grate sliding over the drain hole behind us rang withmetallicfinality.\n 　　The dim light from the street was quickly lost in the gloom. The sound of my staggering footsteps echoedthrough the black space; it sounded very wide, but I couldn\u0027t be sure. There were no sounds other thanmy frantic heartbeat and my feet on the wet stones—except for once, when an impatient sigh whisperedfrom behind me.\n 　　Edward held me tightly. He reached his free hand across his body to hold my face, too, his smooththumb tracing across my lips. Now and then, I felt his face press into my hair. I realized that this was theonly reunion we would get, and I clutched myself closer to him.\n 　　For now, it felt like he wanted me, and that was enough to offset the horror of the subterranean tunneland the prowling vampires behind us. It was probably no more than guilt—the same guilt that compelledhim to come here to die when he\u0027d believed that it was his fault that I\u0027d killed myself. But I felt his lipspress silently against my forehead, and I didn\u0027t care what the motivation was. At least I could be with himagain before I died. That was better than a long life.\n 　　I wished I could ask him exactly what was going to happen now. I wanted desperately to know how wewere going to die—as if that would somehow make it better, knowing in advance. But I couldn\u0027t speak,even in a whisper, surrounded as we were. The others could hear everything—my every breath, myevery heartbeat.\n 　　The path beneath our feet continued to slant downward, taking us deeper into the ground, and it mademe claustrophobic. Only Edward\u0027s hand, soothing against my face, kept me from screaming out loud.\n 　　I couldn\u0027t tell where the light was coming from, but it slowly turned dark gray instead of black. We were in a low, arched tunnel. Long trails of ebony moisture seeped down the gray stones, like they werebleeding ink.\n 　　I was shaking, and I thought it was from fear. It wasn\u0027t until my teeth started to chatter together that Irealized I was cold. My clothes were still wet, and the temperature underneath the city was wintry. Aswas Edward\u0027s skin.\n 　　He realized this at the same time I did, and let go of me, keeping only my hand.\n 　　\"N-n-no,\" I chattered, throwing my arms around him. I didn\u0027t care if I froze. Who knew how long we hadleft?\n 　　His cold hand chafed against my arm, trying to warm me with the friction.\n 　　We hurried through the tunnel, or it felt like hurrying to me. My slow progress irritated someone—Iguessed Felix—and I heard him heave a sigh now and then.\n 　　At the end of the tunnel was a grate—the iron bars were rusting, but thick as my arm. A small door madeof thinner, interlaced bars was standing open. Edward ducked through and hurried on to a larger, brighterstone room. The grille slammed shut with a clang, followed by the snap of a lock. I was too afraid tolook behind me.\n 　　On the other side of the long room was a low, heavy wooden door. It was very thick—as I could tellbecause it, too, stood open.\n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/144/5938.html","bookId":339,"book":{"id":339,"title":"暮光之城：新月 New Moon","description":"简介： Edward and his family leave Forks because he believes he is endangering Bella\u0027s life.
