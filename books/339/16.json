{"id":13596,"no":16,"title":"Chapter 16 Paris","content":"AT THAT MOMENT, MY HEAD BROKE THE SURFACE. 　　How disorienting. I\u0027d been sure I was sinking. 　　The current wouldn\u0027t let up. It was slamming me against more rocks; they beat against the center of myback sharply, rhythmically, pushing the water from my lungs. It gushed out in amazing volume, absolutetorrents pouring from my mouth and nose. The salt burned and my lungs burned and my throat was toofull of water to catch a breath and the rocks were hurting my back. Somehow I stayed in one place,though the waves still heaved around me. I couldn\u0027t see anything but water everywhere, reaching for myface. 　　\"Breathe!\" a voice, wild with anxiety, ordered, and I felt a cruel stab of pain wher I recognized thevoice—because it wasn\u0027t Edward\u0027s. 　　I could not obey. The waterfall pouring from my mouth didn\u0027t stop long enough for me to catch a breath. 　　The black, icy water filled my chest, burning. 　　The rock smacked into my back again, right between my shoulder blades, and another volley of waterchoked its way out of my lungs. 　　\"Breathe, Bella! C\u0027mon!\" Jacob begged. 　　Black spots bloomed across my vision, getting wider and wider, blocking out the light. 　　The rock struck me again. 　　The rock wasn\u0027t cold like the water; it was hot on my skin. I realized it was Jacob\u0027s hand, trying to beatthe water from my lungs. The iron bar that had dragged me from the sea was also… warm… My headwhirled, the black spots covered everything…Was I dying again, then? I didn\u0027t like it—this wasn\u0027t as good as the last time. It was only dark now,nothing worth looking at here. The sound of the crashing waves faded into the black and became a quiet,even whoosh that sounded like it was coming from the inside of my ears…\"Bella?\" Jacob asked, his voice still tense, but not as wild as before. \"Bells, honey, can you hear me?\"The contents of my head swished and rolled sickeningly, like they\u0027d joined the rough water…\"How long has she been unconscious?\" someone else asked. 　　The voice that was not Jacob\u0027s shocked me, jarred me into a more focused awareness. 　　I realized that I was still. There was no tug of the current on me—the heaving was inside my head. Thesurface under me was flat and motionless. It felt grainy against my bare arms. 　　\"I don\u0027t know,\" Jacob reported, still frantic. His voice was very close. Hands—so warm they had to behis—brushed wet hair from my cheeks. \"A few minutes? It didn\u0027t take long to tow her to the beach.\" The quiet whooshing inside my ears was not the waves—it was the air moving in and out of my lungsagain. Each breath burned—the passageways were as raw as if I\u0027d scrubbed them out with steel wool. 　　But I was breathing. 　　And I was freezing. A thousand sharp, icy beads were striking my face and arms, making the cold worse. 　　\"She\u0027s breathing. She\u0027ll come around. We should get her out of the cold, though. I don\u0027t like the colorshe\u0027s turning…\" I recognized Sam\u0027s voice this time. 　　\"You think it\u0027s okay to move her?\"\"She didn\u0027t hurt her back or anything when she fell?\"\"I don\u0027t know.\"They hesitated. 　　I tried to open my eyes. It took me a minute, but then I could see the dark, purple clouds, flinging thefreezing rain down at me. \"Jake?\" I croaked. 　　Jacob\u0027s face blocked out the sky. \"Oh!\" he gasped, relief washing over his features. His eyes were wetfrom the rain. \"Oh, Bella! Are you okay? Can you hear me? Do you hurt anywhere?\"\"J-Just m-my throat,\" I stuttered, my lips quivering from the cold. 　　\"Let\u0027s get you out of here, then,\" Jacob said. He slid his arms under me and lifted me without effort—likepicking up an empty box. His chest was bare and warm; he hunched his shoulders to keep the rain off ofme. My head lolled over his arm. I stared vacantly back toward the furious water, beating the sandbehindhim. 　　\"You got her?\" I heard Sam ask. 　　\"Yeah, I\u0027ll take it from here. Get back to the hospital. I\u0027ll join you later. Thanks, Sam.\"My head was still rolling. None of his words sunk in at first. Sam didn\u0027t answer. There was no sound, andI wondered if he were already gone. 　　The water licked and writhed up the sand after us as Jacob carried me away, like it was angry that I\u0027descaped. As I stared wearily, a spark of color caught my unfocused eyes—a small flash of fire wasdancing on the black water, far out in the bay. The image made no sense, and I wondered how consciousI really was. My head swirled with the memory of the black, churning water—of being so lost that Icouldn\u0027t find up or down. So lost… but somehow Jacob…\"How did you find me?\" I rasped. 　　\"I was searching for you,\" he told me. He was half-jogging through the rain, up the beach toward theroad. \"I followed the tire tracks to your truck, and then I heard you scream…\" He shuddered. \"Whywould you jump, Bella? Didn\u0027t you notice that it\u0027s turning into a hurricane out here? Couldn\u0027t you havewaited for me?\" Anger filled his tone as the relief faded. 　　\"Sorry,\" I muttered. \"It was stupid.\"\"Yeah, it was really stupid,\" he agreed, drops of rain shaking free of his hair as he nodded. \"Look, doyou mind saving the stupid stuff for when I\u0027m around? I won\u0027t be able to concentrate if I think you\u0027rejumping off cliffs behind my back.\" \"Sure,\" I agreed. \"No problem.\" I sounded like a chain-smoker. I tried to clear my throat—and thenwinced; the throat-clearing felt like stabbing a knife down there. \"What happened today? Did you… findher?\" It was my turn to shudder, though I wasn\u0027t so cold here, right next to his ridiculous body heat. 　　Jacob shook his head. He was still more running than walking as he headed up the road to his house. 　　\"No. She took off into the water—the bloodsuckers have the advantage there. That\u0027s why I racedhome—I was afraid she was going to double back swimming. You spend so much time on the beach…\"He trailed off, a catch in his throat. 　　\"Sam came back with you… is everyone else home, too?\" I hoped they weren\u0027t still out searching for her. 　　\"Yeah. Sort of.\"I tried to read his expression, squinting into the hammering rain. His eyes were tight with worry or pain. 　　The words that hadn\u0027t made sense before suddenly did. \"You said… hospital. Before, to Sam. Issomeone hurt? Did she fight you?\" My voice jumped up an octave, sounding strange with the hoarseness. 　　\"No, no. When we got back, Em was waiting with the news. It\u0027s Harry Clearwater. Harry had a heartattack this morning.\"\"Harry?\" I shook my head, trying to absorb what he was staying. \"Oh, no! Does Charlie know?\"\"Yeah. He\u0027s over there, too, with my dad.\"\"Is Harry going to be okay?\"Jacob\u0027s eyes tightened again. \"It doesn\u0027t look so great right now.\"Abruptly, I felt really sick with guilt—felt truly horrible about the brainless cliff dive. Nobody needed tobe worrying about me right now. What a stupid time to be reckless. 　　\"What can I do?\" I asked. 　　At that moment the rain stopped. I hadn\u0027t realized we were already back to Jacob\u0027s house until hewalked through the door. The storm pounded against the roof. 　　\"You can stay here,\" Jacob said as he dumped me on the short couch. \"I mean it—right here I\u0027ll get yousome dry clothes.\"I let my eyes adjust to the dark room while Jacob banged around in his bedroom. The cramped frontroom seemed so empty without Billy, almost desolate. It was strangely ominous—probably just becauseI knew where he was. 　　Jacob was back in seconds. He threw a pile of gray cotton at me. \"These will be huge on you, but it\u0027s thebest I\u0027ve got. I\u0027ll, er, step outside so you can change.\"\"Don\u0027t go anywhere. I\u0027m too tired to move yet. Just stay with me.\"Jacob sat on the floor next to me, his back against the couch. I wondered when he\u0027d slept last. Helooked as exhausted as I felt. 　　He leaned his head on the cushion next to mine and yawned. \"Guess I could rest for a minute…\"His eyes closed. I let mine slide shut, too. 　　 Poor Harry. Poor Sue. I knew Charlie was going to be beside himself. Harry was one of his best friends. 　　Despite Jake\u0027s negative take on things, I hoped fervently that Harry would pull through. For Charlie\u0027ssake. For Sue\u0027s and Leah\u0027s and Seth\u0027s…Billy\u0027s sofa was right next to the radiator, and I was warm now, despite my soaked clothes. My lungsached in a way that pushed me toward unconsciousness rather than keeping me awake. I wonderedvaguely if it was wrong to sleep… or was I getting drowning mixed up with concussions… ? Jacobbegan softly snoring, and the sound of it soothed like a lullaby. I fell asleep quickly. 　　For the first time in a very long time, my dream was just a normal dream. Just a blurred wanderingthrough old memories—blinding bright visions of the Phoenix sun, my mother\u0027s face, a ramshackle treehouse, a faded quilt, a wall of mirrors, a flame on the black water… I forgot each of them as soon as thepicture changed. 　　The last picture was the only one that stuck in my head. It was meaningless—just a set on a stage. Abalcony at night, a painted moon hanging in the sky. I watched the girl in her nightdress lean on the railingand talk to herself. 　　Meaningless… but when I slowly struggled back to consciousness, Juliet was on my mind. 　　Jacob was still asleep; he\u0027d slumped down to the floor and his breathing was deep and even. The housewas darker now than before, it was black outside the window. I was stiff, but warm and almost dry. Theinside of my throat burned with every breath I took. 　　I was going to have to get up—at least to get a drink. But my body just wanted tc he here limp, to nevermove again. 　　Instead of moving, I thought about Juliet some more. 　　I wondered what she would have done if Romeo had left her, not because he was banished, but becausehe lost interests What if Rosalind had given him the time of day, and he\u0027d changed his mind? What if,instead of marrying Juliet, he\u0027d just disappeared? 　　I thought I knew how Juliet would feel. 　　She wouldn\u0027t go back to her old life, not really. She wouldn\u0027t ever have moved on, I was sure of that. 　　Even if she\u0027d lived until she was old and gray, every time she closed her eyes, it would have beenRomeo\u0027s face she saw behind her lids. She would have accepted that, eventually. 　　I wondered if she would have married Paris in the end, just to please her parents, to keep the peace. No,probably not, I decided. But then, the story didn\u0027t say much about Paris. He was just a stick figure—aplaceholder, a threat, a deadline to force her hand. 　　What if there were more to Paris? 　　What if Paris had been Juliet\u0027s friend? Her very best friend? What if he was the only one she couldconfide in about the whole devastating thing with Romeo? The one person who really understood her andmade her feel halfway human again? What if he was patient and kind? What if he took care of her? Whatif Juliet knew she couldn\u0027t survive without him? What if he really loved her, and wanted her to be happy? 　　And… what if she loved Paris? Not like Romeo. Nothing like that, of course. But enough that shewanted him to be happy, too? 　　Jacob\u0027s slow, deep breathing was the only sound in the room—like a lullaby hummed to a child, like the whisper of a rocking chair, like the ticking of an old clock when you had nowhere you needed to go…Itwas the sound of comfort. 　　If Romeo was really gone, never coming back, would it have mattered whether or not Juliet had takenParis up on his offer? Maybe she should have tried to settle into the leftover scraps of life that were leftbehind. Maybe that would have been as close to happiness as she could get. 　　I sighed, and then groaned when the sigh scraped my throat. I was reading too much into the story. 　　Romeo wouldn\u0027t change his mind. That\u0027s why people still remembered his name, always twined with hers: 　　Romeo and Juliet. That\u0027s why it was a good story. \"Juliet gets dumped and ends up with Paris\" wouldhave never been a hit. 　　I closed my eyes and drifted again, letting my mind wander away from the stupid play I didn\u0027t want tothink about anymore. I thought about reality instead—about jumping off the cliff and what a brainlessmistake that had been. And not just the cliff, but the motorcycles and the whole irresponsible EvelKnievel bit. What if something bad happened to me? What would that do to Charlie? Harry\u0027s heartattack had pushed everything suddenly into perspective for me. Perspective that I didn\u0027t want to see,because—if I admitted to the truth of it—it would mean that I would have to change my ways. Could Ilive like that? 　　Maybe. It wouldn\u0027t be easy; in fact, it would be downright miserable to give up my hallucinations and tryto be a grown-up. But maybe I should do it. And maybe I could. If I had Jacob. 　　I couldn\u0027t make that decision right now. It hurt too much. I\u0027d think about something else. 　　Images from my ill-considered afternoon stunt rolled through my head while I tried to come up withsomething pleasant to think about… the feel of the air as I fell, the blackness of the water, the thrashing ofthe current… Edward\u0027s face… I lingered there for a long time. Jacob\u0027s warm hands, trying to beat lifeback into me… the stinging rain flung down by the purple clouds… the strange fire on the waves…There was something familiar about that flash of color on top of the water. Of course it couldn\u0027t really befire—My thoughts were interrupted by the sound of a car squelching through the mud on the road outside. Iheard it stop in front of the house, and doors started opening and closing. I thought about sitting up, andthen decided against that idea. 　　Billy\u0027s voice was easily identifiable, but he kept it uncharacteristically low, so that it was only a gravellygrumble. 　　The door opened, and the light flicked on. I blinked, momentarily blind. Jake startled awake, gasping andjumping to his feet. 　　\"Sorry,\" Billy grunted. \"Did we wake you?\"My eyes slowly focused on his face, and then, as I could read his expression, they filled with tears. 　　\"Oh, no, Billy!\" I moaned. 　　He nodded slowly, his expression hard with grief. Jake hurried to his father and took one of his hands. 　　The pain made his face suddenly childlike—it looked odd on top of the man\u0027s body. 　　Sam was right behind Billy, pushing his chair through the door. His normal composure was absent fromhis agonized face. 　　 \"I\u0027m so sorry,\" I whispered. 　　Billy nodded. \"It\u0027s gonna be hard all around.\"\"Where\u0027s Charlie?\"\"Your dad is still at the hospital with Sue. There are a lot of… arrangements to be made.\"I swallowed hard. 　　\"I\u0027d better get back there,\" Sam mumbled, and he ducked hastily out the door. 　　Billy pulled his hand away from Jacob, and then he rolled himself through the kitchen toward his room. 　　Jake stared after him for a minute, then came to sit on the floor beside me again. He put his face in hishands. I rubbed his shoulder, wishing I could think of anything to say. 　　After a long moment, Jacob caught my hand and held it to his face. 　　\"How are you feeling? Are you okay? I probably should have taken you to a doctor or something.\" Hesighed. 　　\"Don\u0027t worry about me,\" I croaked. 　　He twisted his head to look at me. His eyes were rimmed in red. \"You don\u0027t look so good.\"\"I don\u0027t feel so good, either, I guess.\"\"I\u0027ll go get your truck and then take you home—you probably ought to be there when Charlie gets back.\"\"Right.\"I lay listlessly on the sofa while I waited for him. Billy was silent in the other room. I felt like a peepingtorn, peering through the cracks at a private sorrow that wasn\u0027t mine. 　　It didn\u0027t take Jake long. The roar of my truck\u0027s engine broke the silence before I expected it. He helpedme up from the couch without speaking, keeping his arm around my shoulder when the cold air outsidemade me shiver. He took the driver\u0027s seat without asking, and then pulled me next to his side to keep hisarm tight around me. I leaned my head against his chest. 　　\"How will you get home?\" I asked. 　　\"I\u0027m not going home. We still haven\u0027t caught the bloodsucker, remember?\"My next shudder had nothing to do with cold. 　　It was a quiet ride after that. The cold air had woken me up. My mind was alert, and it was working veryhard and very fast. 　　What if? What was the right thing to do? 　　I couldn\u0027t imagine my life without Jacob now—I cringed away from the idea of even trying to imaginethat. Somehow, he\u0027d become essential to my survival. But to leave things the way they were… was thatcruel, as Mike had accused? 　　I remembered wishing that Jacob were my brother. I realized now that all I really wanted was a claim on him. It didn\u0027t feel brotherly when he held me like this. It just felt nice—warm and comforting and familiar. 　　Safe. Jacob was a safe harbor. 　　I could stake a claim. I had that much within my power. 　　I\u0027d have to tell him everything, I knew that. It was the only way to be fair. I\u0027d have to explain it right, sothat he\u0027d know I wasn\u0027t settling, that he was much too good for me. He already knew I was broken, thatpart wouldn\u0027t surprise him, but he\u0027d need to know the extent of it. I\u0027d even have to admit that I wascrazy—explain about the voices I heard. He\u0027d need to know everything before he made a decision. 　　But, even as I recognized that necessity, I knew he would take me in spite of it all. He wouldn\u0027t evenpause to think it through. 　　I would have to commit to this—commit as much of me as there was left, every one of the brokenpieces. It was the only way to be fair to him. Would I? Could I? 　　Would it be so wrong to try to make Jacob happy? Even if the love I felt for him was no more than aweak echo of what I was capable of, even if my heart was far away, wandering and grieving after myfickle Romeo, would it be so very wrong? 　　Jacob stopped the truck in front of my dark house, cutting the engine so it was suddenly silent. Like somany other times, he seemed to be in tune with my thoughts now. 　　He threw his other arm around me, crushing me against his cheat, binding me to him. Again, this felt nice. 　　Almost like being a whole person again. 　　I thought he would be thinking of Harry, but then he spoke, and his tone was apologetic. \"Sorry. Iknow you don\u0027t feel exactly the way I do, Bella. I swear I don\u0027t mind. I\u0027m just so glad you\u0027re okay that Icould sing—and that\u0027s something no one wants to hear.\" He laughed his throaty laugh in my ear. 　　My breathing kicked up a notch, sanding the walls of my throat. 　　Wouldn\u0027t Edward, indifferent as he might be, want me to be as happy as possible under thecircumstances? Wouldn\u0027t enough friendly emotion linger for him to want that much for me? I thought hewould. He wouldn\u0027t begrudge me this: giving just a small bit of love he didn\u0027t want to my friend Jacob. 　　After all, it wasn\u0027t the same love at all. 　　Jake pressed his warm cheek against the top of my hair. 　　If I turned my face to the side—if I pressed my lips against his bare shoulder... I knew without any doubtwhat would follow. It would be very easy. There would be no need for explanations tonight. 　　But could I do it? Could I betray my absent heart to save my pathetic life? 　　Butterflies assaulted my stomach as I thought of turning my head. 　　And then, as clearly as if I were in immediate danger, Edward\u0027s velvet voice whispered in my ear. 　　\"Be happy,\" he told me. 　　I froze. 　　Jacob felt me stiffen and released me automatically, reaching for the door. 　　Wait, I wanted to say. Just a minute. But I was still locked in place, listening to the echo of Edward\u0027s voice in my head. 　　Storm-cooled air blew through the cab of the truck. 　　\"OH!\" The breath whooshed out of Jacob like someone had punched him in the gut. \"Holy crap!\"He slammed the door and twisted the keys in the ignition at the same moment. His hands were shakingso hard I didn\u0027t know how he managed it. 　　\"What\u0027s wrong?\"He revved the engine too fast; it sputtered and faltered. 　　\"Vampire,\" he spit out. 　　The blood rushed from my head and left me dizzy. \"How do you know?\"\"Because I can smell it. Dammit!\"Jacob\u0027s eyes were wild, raking the dark street. He barely seemed aware of the tremors that were rollingthrough his body. \"Phase or get her out of here?\" he hissed at himself. 　　He looked down at me for a split second, taking in my horror-struck eyes and white face, and then hewas scanning the street again. \"Right. Get you out.\"The engine caught with a roar. The tires squealed as he spun the truck around, turning toward our onlyescape. The headlights washed across the pavement, lit the front line of the black forest, and finallyglinted off a car parked across the street from my house. 　　\"Stop!\" I gasped. 　　It was a black car—a car I knew. I might be the furthest thing from an autophile, but I could tell youeverything about that particular car. It was a Mercedes S55 AMG. I knew the horsepower and the colorof the interior. I knew the feel of the powerful engine purring through the frame. I knew the rich smell ofthe leather seats and the way the extra-dark tint made noon look like dusk through those windows. 　　It was Carlisle\u0027s car. 　　\"Stop!\" I cried again, louder this time, because Jacob was gunning the truck down the street. 　　\"What?!\"\"It\u0027s not Victoria. Stop, stop! I want to go back.\"He stomped on the brake so hard I had to catch myself against the dashboard. 　　\"What?\" he asked again, aghast. He stared at me with horror in his eyes. 　　\"It\u0027s Carlisle\u0027s car! It\u0027s the Cullens. I know it.\"He watched dawn break across my face, and a violent tremor rocked his frame. 　　\"Hey, calm down, Jake. It\u0027s okay. No danger, see? Relax.\"\"Yeah, calm,\" he panted, putting his head down and closing his eyes. While he concentrated on notexploding into a wolf, I stared out the back window at the black car. 　　 It was just Carlisle, I told myself. Don\u0027t expect anything more. Maybe Esme… Stop right there, I toldmyself. Just Carlisle. That was plenty. More than I\u0027d ever hoped to have again. 　　\"There\u0027s a vampire in your house,\" Jacob hissed. \"And you want to go back?\"I glanced at him, ripping my unwilling eyes off the Mercedes—terrified that it would disappear the secondI looked away. 　　\"Of course,\" I said, my voice blank with surprise at his question. Of course I wanted to go back. 　　Jacob\u0027s face hardened while I stared at him, congealing into the bitter mask that I\u0027d thought was gone forgood. Just before he had the mask in place, I caught the spasm of betrayal that flashed in his eyes. Hishands were still shaking. He looked ten years older than me. 　　He took a deep breath. \"You\u0027re sure it\u0027s not a trick?\" he asked in a slow, heavy voice. 　　\"It\u0027s not a trick. It\u0027s Carlisle. Take me back!\"A shudder rippled through his wide shoulders, but his eyes were flat and emotionless. \"No.\"\"Jake, it\u0027s okay—\"\"No. Take yourself back, Bella.\" His voice was a slap—I flinched as the sound of it struck me. His jawclenched and unclenched. 　　\"Look, Bella,\" he said in the same hard voice. \"I can\u0027t go back. Treaty or no treaty, that\u0027s my enemy inthere.\"\"It\u0027s not like that—\"\"I have to tell Sam right away. This changes things. We can\u0027t be caught on their territory.\"\"Jake, it\u0027s not a war!\"He didn\u0027t listen. He put the truck in neutral and jumped out the door, leaving it running. 　　\"Bye, Bella,\" he called back over his shoulder. \"I really hope you don\u0027t die.\" He sprinted into thedarkness, shaking so hard that his shape seemed blurred; he disappeared before I could open my mouthto call him back. 　　Remorse pinned me against the seat for one long second. What had I just done to Jacob\u0027? 　　But remorse couldn\u0027t hold me very long. 　　I slid across the seat and put the truck back in drive. My hands were shaking almost as hard as Jake\u0027shad been, and this took a minute of concentration. Then I carefully turned the truck around and drove itback to my house. 　　It was very dark when I turned off the headlights. Charlie had left in such a hurry that he\u0027d forgotten toleave the porch lamp on. I felt a pang of doubt, staring at the house, deep in shadow. What if it was atrick? 　　I looked back at the black car, almost invisible in the night. No. I knew that car. 　　Still, my hands were shaking even worse than before as I reached for the key above the door. When I grabbed the doorknob to unlock it, it twisted easily under my hand. I let the door fall open. The hallwaywas black. 　　I wanted to call out a greeting, but my throat was too dry. I couldn\u0027t quite seem to catch my breath. 　　I took a step inside and fumbled for the light switch. It was so black—like the black water… Where wasthat switch? 　　Just like the black water, with the orange flame flickering impossibly on top of it. Flame that couldn\u0027t be afire, but what then… ? My fingers traced the wall, still searching, still shaking—Suddenly, something Jacob had told me this afternoon echoed in my head, finally sinking in… She tookoff into the water, he\u0027d said. The bloodsuckers have the advantage there. That\u0027s why I raced home—I was afraid she was going to double back swimming. 　　My hand froze in its searching, my whole body froze into place, as I realized why I recognized thestrange orange color on the water. 　　Victoria\u0027s hair, blowing wild in the wind, the color of fire…She\u0027d been right there. Right there in the harbor with me and Jacob. If Sam hadn\u0027t been there, if it hadbeen just the two of us… ? I couldn\u0027t breathe or move. 　　The light flicked on, though my frozen hand had still not found the switch.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/144/5934.html","bookId":339,"book":{"id":339,"title":"暮光之城：新月 New Moon","description":"简介： Edward and his family leave Forks because he believes he is endangering Bella\u0027s life.
