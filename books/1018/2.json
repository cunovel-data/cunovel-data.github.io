{"id":26762,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER I.","content":"There was a card party at the rooms of Narumoff, a lieutenant in the Horse Guards. A long winter night had passed unnoticed, and it was five o\u0027clock in the morning when supper was served. The winners sat down to table with an excellent appetite; the losers let their plates remain empty before them. Little by little, however, with the assistance of the champagne, the conversation became animated, and was shared by all. \"How did you get on this evening, Surin?\" said the host to one of his friends. \"Oh, I lost, as usual. I really have no luck. I play mirandole. You know that I keep cool. Nothing moves me; I never change my play, and yet I always lose.\" \"Do you mean to say that all the evening you did not once back the red? Your firmness of character surprises me.\" [Pg 18] \"What do you think of Hermann?\" said one of the party, pointing to a young Engineer officer. \"That fellow never made a bet or touched a card in his life, and yet he watches us playing until five in the morning.\" \"It interests me,\" said Hermann; \"but I am not disposed to risk the necessary in view of the superfluous.\" \"Hermann is a German, and economical; that is the whole of the secret,\" cried Tomski. \"But what is really astonishing is the Countess Anna Fedotovna!\" \"How so?\" asked several voices. \"Have you not remarked,\" said Tomski, \"that she never plays?\" \"Yes,\" said Narumoff, \"a woman of eighty, who never touches a card; that is indeed something extraordinary!\" \"You do not know why?\" \"No; is there a reason for it?\" \"Just listen. My grandmother, you know, some sixty years ago, went to Paris, and became the rage there. People ran after her in the streets, and called her the \u0027Muscovite Venus.\u0027 Richelieu made love to her, and my grandmother makes out that, by her rigorous demeanour, she almost drove him to suicide. In those days women used to play at faro. One evening at the court she lost, on parole, to the Duke of Orleans,[Pg 19] a very considerable sum. When she got home, my grandmother removed her beauty spots, took off her hoops, and in this tragic costume went to my grandfather, told him of her misfortune, and asked him for the money she had to pay. My grandfather, now no more, was, so to say, his wife\u0027s steward. He feared her like fire; but the sum she named made him leap into the air. He[Pg 20] flew into a rage, made a brief calculation, and proved to my grandmother that in six months she had got through half a million rubles. He told her plainly that he had no villages to sell in Paris, his domains being situated in the neighbourhood of Moscow and of Saratoff; and finally refused point blank. You may imagine the fury of my grandmother. She boxed his ears, and passed the night in another room. \"THE OLD MAGICIAN CAME AT ONCE.\" \"The next day she returned to the charge. For the first time in her life, she condescended to arguments and explanations. In vain did she try to prove to her husband that there were debts and debts, and that she could not treat a prince of the blood like her coachmaker. \"All this eloquence was lost. My grandfather was inflexible. My grandmother did not know where to turn. Happily she was acquainted with a man who was very celebrated at this time. You have heard of the Count of St. Germain, about whom so many marvellous stories were told. You know that he passed for a sort of Wandering Jew, and that he was said to possess an elixir of life and the philosopher\u0027s stone. \"Some people laughed at him as a charlatan. Casanova, in his memoirs, says that he was a spy. However that may be, in spite of the mystery of his life, St. Germain was much sought after in good society, and was really an agreeable man.[Pg 21] Even to this day my grandmother has preserved a genuine affection for him, and she becomes quite angry when anyone speaks of him with disrespect. \"It occurred to her that he might be able to advance the sum of which she was in need, and she wrote a note begging him to call. The old magician came at once, and found her plunged in the deepest despair. In two or three words she told him everything; related to him her misfortune and the cruelty of her husband, adding that she had no hope except in his friendship and his obliging disposition. \"\u0027Madam,\u0027 said St. Germain, after a few moments\u0027 reflection, \u0027I could easily advance you the money you want, but I am sure that you would have no rest until you had repaid me, and I do not want to get you out of one trouble in order to place you in another. There is another way of settling the matter. You must regain the money you have lost.\u0027 \"\u0027But, my dear friend,\u0027 answered my grandmother, \u0027I have already told you that I have nothing left.\u0027 \"\u0027That does not matter,\u0027 answered St. Germain. \u0027Listen to me, and I will explain.\u0027 \"He then communicated to her a secret which any of you would, I am sure, give a good deal to possess.\" [Pg 22] All the young officers gave their full attention. Tomski stopped to light his Turkish pipe, swallowed a mouthful of smoke, and then went on. \"That very evening my grandmother went to Versailles to play at the Queen\u0027s table. The Duke of Orleans held the bank. My grandmother invented a little story by way of excuse for not having paid her debt, and then sat down at the table, and began to stake. She took three cards. She won with the first; doubled her stake on the second, and won again; doubled on the third, and still won.\" \"Mere luck!\" said one of the young officers. \"What a tale!\" cried Hermann. \"Were the cards marked?\" said a third. \"I don\u0027t think so,\" replied Tom ski, gravely. \"And you mean to say,\" exclaimed Narumoff, \"that you have a grandmother who knows the names of three winning cards, and you have never made her tell them to you?\" \"That is the very deuce of it,\" answered Tomski. \"She had three sons, of whom my father was one; all three were determined gamblers, and not one of them was able to extract her secret from her, though it would have been of immense advantage to them, and to me also. Listen to what my uncle told me about it, Count Ivan Ilitch, and he told me on his word of honour. \"Tchaplitzki—the one you remember who died[Pg 23] in poverty after devouring millions—lost one day, when he was a young man, to Zoritch about three hundred thousand roubles. He was in despair. My grandmother, who had no mercy for the extravagance of young men, made an exception—I do not know why—in favour of Tchaplitzki. She gave him three cards, telling him to play them one after the other, and exacting from him at the same time his word of honour that he would never afterwards touch a card as long as he lived. Accordingly Tchaplitzki went to Zoritch and asked for his revenge. On the first card he staked fifty thousands rubles. He won, doubled the stake, and won again. Continuing his system he ended by gaining more than he had lost. \"But it is six o\u0027clock! It is really time to go to bed.\" Everyone emptied his glass and the party broke up.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1829/53061.html","bookId":1018,"book":{"id":1018,"title":"The Queen of Spades and other stories","description":"简介： Alexander Sergueievitch Pushkin came of a noble family, so ancient that it was traced back to that Alexander Nevsky who, in the thirteenth century, gained a great victory over the Swedes upon the ice of the River Neva, in token whereof he was surname...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1829","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:09 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:09 AM"}}
