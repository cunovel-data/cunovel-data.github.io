I’ve heard married sex is pretty hot.”\n Laughing, Jack swept her into his arms and started toward the villa. But he didn’t make it far before he stopped and set her back on her feet.\n “Oh, for Christsake, Jack, what now?”\n He put his mouth on her ear, loving how it always caused her to tremble. Loving her whimpering sigh.\n “Ever rolled around naked on a beach?”\n “Ah. No. Have you?”\n “No.”\n “That’d be a first for both of us.”\n “That would be pretty goddamned romantic.”\n They looked at each other.

She had less clothing on than he did. But truthfully, the first rays of moonlight reflecting off all her mouthwatering curves distracted him.\n That, and the fact she still wore that sexy white wedding lingerie beneath her sundress.\n Damn.\n She tackled him. Pinned him. Kissed him. Owned him completely.
