{"id":70019,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"The crack of the rifle echoed over the rock and sent a lone hawk wheeling. Sarah gritted her teeth, cocked the lever and squeezed again. The empty whiskey bottle exploded. She was improving, she decided as she mopped her brow and reloaded. And she was determined to get better still.\\n\\n Lucius wandered over, Lafitte dancing at his heels.\\n\\n \"You got a good eye there, Miss Sarah.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you.\" She lowered the rifle to give the pup a scratch. Jake was right. He was going to be a big one. \"I believe I do.\"\\n\\n No one was going to have to rescue her again, not from a rattlesnake, not from Apache marauders, not from the wrath of God himself. In the two weeks since Jake had dropped her, without a word and apparently without a thought, on her doorstep, she\u0027d increased her daily rifle practice. Her aim had sharpened a great deal since she\u0027d taken to imagining that the empty bottles and cans were Jake\u0027s grinning face.\\n\\n \"I told you, Lucius, there\u0027s no need for you to watch my every move. What happened before wasn\u0027t your fault.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t help feeling it was. You hired me on to keep a look out around here. Then the first time my pants\u0027re down-so to speak, Miss Sarah-you\u0027re in trouble.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m back now, and unharmed.\"\\n\\n \"And I\u0027m mighty grateful for it. If Jake hadn\u0027t just ridden up...I\u0027d have tried to get you back, Miss Sarah, but he was the man for it.\"\\n\\n She bit back the unkind remark that sprang to mind. He had saved her, had risked his life to do so. Whatever had happened afterward couldn\u0027t diminish that.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m very grateful to Mr. Redman, Lucius.\"\\n\\n \"Jake just done what he had to.\"\\n\\n She remembered the knife fight with a shudder. \"I sincerely hope he won\u0027t be required to do anything like it again.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s why I\u0027m going to keep a better eye on you. I tell you the God\u0027s truth now, Miss Sarah, worrying after a woman\u0027s a troublesome thing. I ain\u0027t had to bother since my wife died.\"\\n\\n \"Why, Lucius, I never knew you\u0027d been married.\" \"Some years back. Quiet Water was her name. She was mighty dear to me.\"\\n\\n \"You had an Indian wife?\" Wanting to hear more, Sarah sat down on a rock, spreading her skirts.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t talk about it often, at least not when he was sober. But he found he was making himself comfortable and telling his tale. \"Yes, ma\u0027am. She was Apache, one of Little Bear\u0027s tribe. Fact is, she\u0027d\u0027ve been some kind of aunt to him. I met her when I\u0027d come out here to do some soldiering. Fought Cheyenne, mostly. That would have been back in \u002762.\\n\\n Didn\u0027t mind the fighting, but I sure got tired of the marching. I headed south some to do a little prospecting.\\n\\n Anyways, I met up with John Redman. That was Jake\u0027s pa.\"\\n\\n \"You knew Jake\u0027s father?\"\\n\\n \"Knew him right well. Partnered up for a while. He and his missus had hit some hard times. Lot of people didn\u0027t care much for the idea of him being half-Apache.\" With a little laugh, he shrugged. \"He told me once that some of his tribe didn\u0027t care much for the idea of him being half-white. So there you go.\" \"What kind of man was he?\"\\n\\n \"Hardheaded, but real quiet. Didn\u0027t say much less\u0027n you said something first. Could be funny. Sometimes it wouldn\u0027t occur to you for a minute or two that he\u0027d made a joke. He was good for a laugh. Guess he was the best friend I ever had.\" He took out his bottle and was relieved when Sarah said nothing. \"John had in mind to do some ranching, so I lent a hand here and there. That\u0027s how I came to meet Quiet Water.\"\\n\\n Casually Sarah pleated her skirt. \"I suppose you knew Jake as a boy.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll say I did.\" Lucius let go a whistling laugh.\\n\\n \"Tough little cuss. Could look a hole right through you. Ain\u0027t changed much. He was spending some time with his grandma\u0027s people. Would\u0027ve thought he was one of them then, \u0027cept for the eyes. Course, he wasn\u0027t. They knew it and he knew it. Like John said, it\u0027s hard not being one or the other. I used to wonder what would\u0027ve happened if Quiet Water and me had had kids.\"\\n\\n \"What happened to her, Lucius?\"\\n\\n \"I had gone off looking for gold.\" His eyes narrowed as he stared off into the sun. \"Seems a regiment rode through early one morning. Some settler claimed his stock was stolen, and that the Apaches had done it. So the soldiers came in, looking for trouble, hating Indians. Killed most everybody but those who made it up into the rocks.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, Lucius. Lucius, I\u0027m so sorry.\" Unable to find words, she took both his hands in hers.\\n\\n \"When I come back, it was done. I was half-crazy, I guess. Rode around for days, not going anywhere. I guess I was hoping somebody\u0027d come along and shoot me. Then I headed to the Redman place. They\u0027d been burned out.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, dear God.\"\\n\\n \"Nothing left but charred wood and ashes.\"\\n\\n \"How horrible.\" She tightened her grip on his hands. \"Oh, Lucius, it wasn\u0027t the soldiers?\"\\n\\n \"No. Leastwise they weren\u0027t wearing uniforms.\\n\\n Seemed like some men from town got liquored up and decided they didn\u0027t want no breed that close by. John and his missus had had trouble before, like I said, but this went past hard words and threats. They started out to burn the barn, raise hell. One of them started shooting. Maybe they\u0027d meant to all along, there\u0027s no saying. When it was over, they\u0027d burned them out and left the family for dead.\"\\n\\n Horror made her eyes dark and huge. \"Jake. He would have been just a boy.\"\\n\\n \"Thirteen, fourteen, I reckon. But he was past being a boy. I found him where he\u0027d buried his folks. He was just sitting there, between the two fresh graves. Has his pa\u0027s hunting knife in his hands. Still carries it.\"\\n\\n She knew the knife. She\u0027d seen it stained with blood, for her. But now all she could think of was the boy. \"Oh, the poor child. He must have been so frightened.\"\\n\\n \"No, ma\u0027am. I don\u0027t believe frightened\u0027s the word. He was chanting, like in a trance the Indians sometimes use. War chant, it was. He figured on going into town and finding the men who killed his folks.\" \"But you said he was only thirteen.\"\\n\\n \"I said he was past being a boy. Best I could do was talk him out of it for a time, till he learned to handle a gun better. He learned mighty fast. I ain\u0027t never seen a man do with a gun what Jake can do.\" Though it was hot out, she rubbed the chill from her arms. \"Did he...go back for them?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t rightly know. I never asked. I thought it best we move on until he had some years on him, so we headed south. Didn\u0027t know what to do for Mm. Bought him a horse, and we rode together awhile. I always figured he\u0027d hook up with the wrong kind, but Jake was never much for hooking up with anybody. He\u0027d\u0027ve been about sixteen when we parted ways. Heard about him off and on. Then he rode into Lone Bluff a few months back.\"\\n\\n \"To lose everything that way.\" A tear ran down her cheek. \"It\u0027s a wonder he\u0027s not filled with hate.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s got it in him, but it\u0027s cold. Me, I use the bottle, wash it away now and then. Jake uses something in here.\" He tapped his temple. \"That boy holds more inside than anybody should have to. He ever lets it out, people better stand back.\"\\n\\n She understood what he meant. Hadn\u0027t she seen it, that flat, dangerous look that came into his eyes? That expressionless stare that was more passionate than fury, more deadly than rage.\\n\\n \"You care for him.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s all I got that you might call family. Yeah, I got an affection for the boy.\" Lucius squinted over at her. \"I figure you do, too.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what I feel for him.\" That was a lie. She knew very well what she felt, how she felt. She was even coming to understand why she felt. He wasn\u0027t the man she had once imagined she would love, but he was the only man she ever would. \"It doesn\u0027t matter what I feel,\" she said, \"if he doesn\u0027t feel it back.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe he does. It might be hard for him to say it right out, but I always figure a woman\u0027s got a sense about those things.\"\\n\\n \"Not always.\" With a little sigh, she rose. \"There\u0027s work to be done, Lucius.\"\\n\\n \"Yes\u0027m.\"\\n\\n \"There is one question. What have you been doing in the mine?\"\\n\\n \"The mine, Miss Sarah?\"\\n\\n \"You said yourself I have a good eye. I know you\u0027ve been going in there. I\u0027d like to know why.\"\\n\\n \"Well, now.\" Fabricating wasn\u0027t Lucius\u0027s strong suit. He coughed and shifted his feet and peered off at nothing. \"Just having a look around.\"\\n\\n \"For gold?\"\\n\\n \"Could be.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think you\u0027ll find any?\"\\n\\n \"Matt always figured there was a rich vein in that rock, and when Jake-\" He broke off.\\n\\n \"When Jake what? Asked you to look?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe he might have suggested it sometime.\"\\n\\n \"I see.\" Sarah looked up to the top of the ridge. She had always wondered what Jake wanted, she thought, her heart shattering. Perhaps she knew now* Gold seemed to pull at the men she loved. \"I have no objection to you working the mine, Lucius. In fact, I think it\u0027s an excellent idea. You must let me know if you require any tools.\" When she looked back at him, her eyes were as cool and hard as any man\u0027s. \"The next time you ride into town, you might mention to Jake that Sarah\u0027s Pride is mine.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am, if you\u0027d like.\"\\n\\n \"I insist.\" She looked toward the road. \"There\u0027s a buggy coming.\"\\n\\n Lucius spit and hoped it wasn\u0027t Carlson. As far as he was concerned, the man had been too free with his visits to Sarah in the past few weeks.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t Carlson. As the buggy drew closer, Sarah saw it was a woman holding the reins. Not Liza, she realized with a pang of disappointment. The woman was dark and delicate and a stranger to her.\\n\\n \"Good morning.\" Sarah set the rifle against the wall of the house.\\n\\n \"Good morning, ma\u0027am.\" The young woman sat in the buggy and sent Sarah a nervous smile. \"You sure live a ways out.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" Since her visitor didn\u0027t seem in a hurry to alight, Sarah walked to the buggy. \"I\u0027m Sarah Conway.\" \"Yes, ma\u0027am, I know. I\u0027m Alice. Alice Johnson.\" She gave the puppy a bright, cheerful smile, then looked at Sarah again. \"Pleased to meet you.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s nice to meet you, too, Miss Johnson. Would you like to come in for some tea?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, no, ma\u0027am, I couldn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n Baffled by Alice\u0027s horrified expression, Sarah tried again. \"Perhaps you\u0027re lost?\"\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027ve come to talk with you, but I couldn\u0027t come in. It wouldn\u0027t be fitting.\"\\n\\n \"Oh? Why?\"\\n\\n \"Well, you see, Miss Conway, I\u0027m one of Carlotta\u0027s girls.\"\\n\\n Carlotta? Wide-eyed, Sarah looked her visitor over again. She was hardly more than a girl, a year or more younger than Sarah herself. Her face was scrubbed clean, and her dress was certainly modest. As Sarah stared, thick lashes lowered over her dark eyes and a blush rushed into her cheeks.\\n\\n \"Do you mean you work at the Silver Star?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am, for nearly three months now.\"\\n\\n \"But-\" Sarah swallowed the words when she saw Alice bite her lip. \"Miss Johnson, if you\u0027ve come to see me, I suggest we talk inside. It\u0027s much too hot to stand in the sun.\"\\n\\n \"I couldn\u0027t. Really, it wouldn\u0027t be fitting, Miss Conway.\"\\n\\n \"Fitting or not, I don\u0027t wish sunstroke on either of us. Please, come in.\" Leaving the decision in the hands of her visitor, Sarah walked inside.\\n\\n Alice hesitated. It didn\u0027t feel right, not when Miss Conway was a real lady. But if she went back and couldn\u0027t tell Carlotta that she\u0027d done what she\u0027d been sent for, she\u0027d get slapped around for sure. Carlotta always knew when you lied. And you always paid for it.\\n\\n Sarah heard the timid footsteps as she put water on to boil. Before she could turn and offer Alice a seat, the girl was bubbling.\\n\\n \"Oh, my, isn\u0027t this pretty? You\u0027ve got a real nice place here, Miss Conway. Curtains and all.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you.\" Her smile was full and genuine. It was the first time she\u0027d had company who had thought so. \"I\u0027m more and more at home here. Please, sit down, Miss Johnson. I\u0027m making tea.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s real kind of you, but I don\u0027t feel right, you giving me tea. It ain\u0027t proper.\"\\n\\n \"This is my house, and you\u0027re my guest. Of course it\u0027s proper. I hope you\u0027ll enjoy these cookies. I made them only yesterday.\"\\n\\n With her fingers plucking nervously at her skirt, Alice sat. \"Thank you, ma\u0027am. And don\u0027t worry. I won\u0027t tell a soul I came in and sat at your table.\"\\n\\n Intrigued, Sarah poured the tea. \"Why don\u0027t you tell me what brought you out to see me?\"\\n\\n \"Carlotta. She\u0027s been looking at all the dresses you\u0027ve been making for the ladies in town. They\u0027re real pretty, Miss Conway.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you.\"\\n\\n \"Just the other day, after Jake left-\"\\n\\n \"Jake?\"\\n\\n \"Yes\u0027m.\" Hoping she was holding the cup properly, Alice drank. \"He comes into the Silver Star pretty regular. Carlotta\u0027s real fond of him. She don\u0027t work much herself, you know. Unless it\u0027s somebody like Jake.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I see.\" She waited for what was left of her heart to break. Instead, it swelled with fury. \"I suppose she might find a man like him appealing.\"\\n\\n \"She surely does. All the girls got a fondness for Jake.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure,\" she murmured.\\n\\n \"Well, like I was saying, Carlotta got it into her head one day after he left that we should have us some new clothes. Something classy, like ladies would wear. She told me Jake said you could sew some up for us.\"\\n\\n \"Did he?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am. She said she thought Jake had a real fine idea there, and she sent me on out to see about it. I got me all the measurements.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Miss Johnson, I really couldn\u0027t. Be sure to tell Carlotta that I appreciate the offer.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s eight of us girls, miss, and Carlotta said she\u0027d pay you in advance. I got the money.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s generous, but I can\u0027t do it. Would you like more tea?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t-\" Confused, Alice looked at her cup. She didn\u0027t know anyone who\u0027d ever said no to Carlotta.\\n\\n \"If it\u0027s not too much trouble.\" She wanted to stretch out her visit, though she knew that, and the message she\u0027d be taking back, would make Carlotta box her ears.\\n\\n \"Miss Johnson-\"\\n\\n \"You can call me Alice, Miss Conway. Everybody does.\"\\n\\n \"Alice, then. Would you mind telling me how it was you came to work for Carlotta? You\u0027re very young to be...on your own.\"\\n\\n \"My daddy sold me off.\"\\n\\n \"Sold you?\"\\n\\n \"There was ten of us at home, and another on the way. Every time he got drunk he whipped one of us or made another. He got drunk a lot. Few months back, a man passed through and Daddy sold me for twenty dollars. I ran off as soon as I could. When I got to Lone Bluff I went to work for Carlotta. I know it ain\u0027t right and proper, but it\u0027s better than what I had. I get my meals and a bed to myself when I\u0027m finished work.\" She gave a quick, uncomfortable shrug. \"Most of the men are all right.\"\\n\\n \"Your father had no right to sell you, Alice.\"\\n\\n \"Sometimes there\u0027s right and there\u0027s what\u0027s done.\" \"If you wanted to leave Carlotta, I\u0027m sure there would be other work for you in town. Proper work.\" \"Begging your pardon, Miss Conway, but that ain\u0027t true. None of the town ladies would hire me for anything.\\n\\n And they shouldn\u0027t. Why, how would they know if I\u0027d been with one of their husbands?\"\\n\\n It was sound thinking, but Sarah shook her head. \"If you decide to leave, I\u0027ll find work for you.\"\\n\\n Alice stared at her, wide-eyed. \"That\u0027s kind of you. I knew you were a real lady, Miss Conway, and I\u0027m obliged. I\u0027d better be heading back.\"\\n\\n \"If you\u0027d like to visit again, I\u0027d be happy to see you,\" Sarah told her as she walked her out.\\n\\n \"No, ma\u0027am, that wouldn\u0027t be proper. Thank you for the tea, Miss Conway.\"\\n\\n Sarah thought a great deal about Alice\u0027s visit. That night, as she read her father\u0027s journal by lamplight, she tried to imagine what it had been like. To be sold, she thought with an inward shudder. By her own father, like a horse or a steer. It was true that she, too, had spent years of her life without a real family, but she had always known her father loved her. What he had done, he had done with her best interests at heart. Once she would have condemned Alice\u0027s choice out of hand. But now she thought she understood. It was all the girl knew. The cycle had begun with her father\u0027s callousness, and the girl was caught in it, helplessly moving in the same circle, selling herself time after time because she knew nothing else.\\n\\n Had it been the same for Jake? Had the cruelty he\u0027d lived through as a child forced him into a life of restlessness and violence? The scars he carried must run deep. And the hate. Sarah looked into the soft glow of the lamp. As Lucius had said, the hate ran cold.\\n\\n She should have hated him. She wanted to, she wished the strong, destructive emotion would come, filling all the cracks in her feelings, blocking out everything else. With hate, a coolheaded, sharply honed hate, she would have felt in control again. She needed badly to feel in control again. But she didn\u0027t hate him.\\n\\n She couldn\u0027t.\\n\\n Even though she knew he had spent the night with another woman, kissing another woman\u0027s lips, touching another woman\u0027s skin, she couldn\u0027t hate him. But she could grieve for her loss, for the death of a beauty that had never had a chance to bloom fully.\\n\\n She had come to understand what they might have had together. She had almost come to accept that they belonged together, whatever their differences, whatever the risks. He would always live by his gun and by his own set of rules, but with her, briefly, perhaps reluctantly, he had shown such kindness, such tenderness. There was a place for her in his heart. Sarah knew it. Beneath the rough-hewn exterior was a man who believed in justice, who was capable of small, endearing kindnesses. He\u0027d allowed her to see that part of him, a part she knew he\u0027d shared with few others.\\n\\n Then why, the moment she had begun to soften toward him, to accept him for what and who he was, had he turned to another woman? A woman whose love could be bought with a handful of coins?\\n\\n What did it matter? With a sigh, she closed her father\u0027s journal and prepared for bed. She had only fooled herself into believing he could care for her. Whatever kindness Jake had shown her would always war with his lawless nature and his restless heart. She wanted a home, a man by her side and children at her feet. As long as she loved Jake, she would go on wanting and never having.\\n\\n Somehow, no matter how hard it was, no matter how painful, she would stop loving him.\\n\\n Jake hated himself for doing it, but he rode toward Sarah\u0027s place, a dozen excuses forming in his head. He wanted to talk to Lucius and check on the progress in the mine. He wanted to make sure she hadn\u0027t been bitten by a snake. He\u0027d wanted a ride, and her place was as good as any.\\n\\n They were all lies.\\n\\n He just wanted to see her. He just wanted to look at her, hear her talk, smell her hair. He\u0027d stayed away from her for two weeks, hadn\u0027t he? He had a right... He had no rights, he told himself as he rode into the yard. He had no rights, and no business thinking about her the way he was thinking about her, wanting her the way he wanted her.\\n\\n She deserved a man who could make her promises and keep them, who could give her the kind of life she\u0027d been born to live.\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t going to touch her again. That was a promise he\u0027d made himself when he\u0027d ridden away from her the last time. If he touched her, he wouldn\u0027t pull back. That would only cause them both more misery. He\u0027d hurt her. He had seen that plain enough when he\u0027d left her. But that was nothing compared to what he would have done if he\u0027d stayed.\\n\\n It was quiet. Jake pulled up his mount and took a long, cautious look around, his hand hovering over the butt of his gun. The dog wasn\u0027t yapping, nor was there any smoke rising from the chimney. The saddle creaked as he dismounted.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t knock, but pushed open the door and listened. There wasn\u0027t a sound from inside. He could see, as his eyes scanned from one corner to the next, that the cabin was empty and as tidy as a church. The curtains she\u0027d sewed had already begun to fade, but they moved prettily in the hot wind. His shoulders relaxed.\\n\\n She\u0027d done something here. That was something else he had to admire about her. She\u0027d taken less than nothing and made it a home. There were pictures on the walls. One was a watercolor of wildflowers in soft, dreamy hues. It looked like her, he thought as he took a closer study. All dewy and fresh and delicate. Flowers like that would wither fast if they weren\u0027t tended. He moved to the next, his brows drawing together as he scanned it. It was a pencil drawing-a sketch, he figured she\u0027d call it. He recognized the scene, the high, arrogant buttes, the sun-bleached rock. If you looked west from the stream you\u0027d see it. It wasn\u0027t an empty place. The Apache knew the spirits that lived there. But oddly, as he studied the lines and shadows, he thought Sarah might know them, too. He would never have imagined her taking the time to draw something so stark and strong, much less hang it on the wall so that she would see it every time she turned around.\\n\\n Somehow-he couldn\u0027t quite figure out the why of it-it suited her every bit as much as the wildflowers.\\n\\n Annoyed with himself, he turned away. She knew something about magic, he figured. Didn\u0027t the cabin smell of her, so that his stomach kept tying itself in knots? He\u0027d be better off out in the ah--fifty miles away.\\n\\n A book caught his eye as he started out. Without giving a thought to her privacy, he opened it. Apparently she\u0027d started a diary. Unable to resist, he scanned the first page.\\n\\n She\u0027d described her arrival in Lone Bluff. He had to grin as he read over her recounting of the Apache raid and his timely arrival. She\u0027d made him sound pretty impressive, even if she\u0027d noted what she called his \"infuriating and unchristian behavior.\"\\n\\n There was a long passage about her father, and her feelings about him. He passed it by. Grief was to be respected, unless it needed to be shared. He chuckled out loud as she described her first night, the cold can of beans and the sounds that had kept her awake and trembling until morning. There were bits and pieces he found entertaining enough about the townspeople and her impressions of life in the West. Then he caught his name again.\\n\\n \"Jake Redman is an enigma.\" He puzzled over the word, sure he\u0027d never heard it before. It sounded a little too fancy to be applied to him.\\n\\n I don\u0027t know if one might call him a diamond in the rough, though rough he certainly is. Honesty forces me to admit that he has been of some help to me and shown glimmers of kindness. I can\u0027t resolve my true feelings about him, and I wonder why I find it necessary to try. He is a law unto himself and a man wholly lacking in manners and courtesy. His reputation is distressing, to say the least. He is what is referred to as a gunslinger, and he wears his weapons as smoothly as a gentleman wears a watch fob. Yet I believe if one dug deeply enough one might discover a great deal of goodness there. Fortunately, I have neither the time nor the inclination to do the digging. Despite his manner and his style of living there is a certain, even a strong, attractiveness about him. He has fine eyes of clear gray, a mouth that some women might call poetic, particularly when he smiles, and truly beautiful hands.\\n\\n He stopped there to frown down at his hands.\\n\\n They\u0027d been called a lot of things, but beautiful wasn\u0027t one of them. He wasn\u0027t sure he cared for it. Still, she sure did have a way with words.\\n\\n He turned the page and would have read on, but the slightest of sounds at his back had him whirling, his guns gripped firmly in his hands.\\n\\n Lucius swore long and skillfully as he lowered his own pistol. \"I ain\u0027t lived this long to have you blow holes in me.\"\\n\\n Jake slipped his guns home. \"You\u0027d better be careful how you come up on a man. Didn\u0027t you see my horse?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I saw it. Just making sure. Didn\u0027t expect to find you poking around in here.\" He glanced down at the book. Without a word, Jake shut it.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t expect to find the place deserted.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been up to the mine.\" Lucius pulled a small bottle of whiskey from his pocket.\\n\\n \"And?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s interesting.\" He took a long pull, then wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. \"I can\u0027t figure how Matt got himself caught in that cave-in. He was pretty sharp, and I recollect them beams being secure enough. Looks to me like someone worked pretty hard to bring them down.\"\\n\\n With a nod, Jake glanced at the watercolor on the wall. \"Have you said anything to her yet?\"\\n\\n \"Nope.\" He didn\u0027t think it was the best time to tell Jake that Sarah had found him out. \"There\u0027s something else I haven\u0027t mentioned.\" His face split into a grin as Jake looked at nun. \"There\u0027s gold in there, boy. Just like Matt always claimed. He\u0027d found the mother lode.\" Lucius took a swig from the bottle, then corked it. \"You figured on that?\"\\n\\n \"Just a hunch.\"\\n\\n \"Want me to keep it under my hat?\"\\n\\n \"For the time being.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t care much for playing tricks on Miss Sarah, but I reckon you\u0027ve got your reasons.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got them.\"\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t ask you what they are. I won\u0027t ask you neither what reasons you got for not coming around lately. Miss Sarah, she\u0027s been looking a mite peaked since you brought her back from the hills.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s sick?\" he asked, too quickly.\\n\\n Lucius rubbed a hand over his mouth to hide a grin.\\n\\n \"I figure she\u0027s got a fever, all right. Heart fever.\" \"She\u0027ll get over it,\" Jake muttered as he walked outside.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re looking peaked yourself.\" When Jake didn\u0027t answer, he tried again. \"Sure is some woman. Looks soft, but that streak of stubborn keeps her going. See there?\" He pointed to the vegetable patch. \"She\u0027s got something growing there. Never thought I\u0027d see a speck of green, but there you go. She waters that thing every day. Stubborn. A stubborn woman\u0027s just bound to make things happen.\"\\n\\n \"Where is she?\"\\n\\n Lucius had been hoping he\u0027d ask. \"Gone off driving with Carlson. He\u0027s been coming around here near every day. Drinks tea.\" He spit. \"Kisses her fingers and calls her right out by her first name.\" It warmed his heart to see Jake\u0027s eyes harden. \"Said something about taking her to see his ranch. Been gone better than an hour now.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know when I\u0027ve spent a more pleasant day.\" Sarah rose from the glossy mahogany table in Carlson\u0027s dining room. \"Or had a more delightful meal.\"\\n\\n \"The pleasure has been mine.\" Carlson took her hand. \"All mine.\"\\n\\n Sarah smiled and gently took her hand away. \"You have such a beautiful home. I never expected to see anything like it out here.\"\\n\\n \"My grandfather loved beautiful things.\" He took her elbow. \"I inherited that love from him. Most of the furniture was shipped in from Europe. We had to make some concessions to the land.\" He patted a thick adobe wall. \"But there\u0027s no reason to sacrifice all our comforts. This painting-\" He guided her to a portrait of a pale, elegant woman in blue silk. \"My mother. She was my grandfather\u0027s pride and joy. His wife died before this house was completed. Everything he did from that day was for his daughter.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s lovely.\"\\n\\n \"She was. Even my grandfather\u0027s love and devotion couldn\u0027t keep her alive. The women in my family have always been delicate. This land is hard, too hard for the fragile. It baked the life out of her. I suppose that\u0027s why I worry about you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not as delicate as you might think.\" She thought of the ride into the mountains with her hands and feet bound.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re strong-willed. I find that very attractive.\" He took her hand again. Before she could decide how to respond, a man strode into the house. He was shorter and leaner than Carlson, but there was enough of a resemblance around the mouth and eyes for her to recognize him. His hat was pushed back so that it hung around his neck by its strap. Yellow dust coated his clothes. He hooked his thumbs in the pockets of his pants and looked at her in a way that made her blood chill.\\n\\n \"Well, now, what have we got here?\"\\n\\n \"Miss Conway.\" There was a warning, mild but definite, in Carlson\u0027s voice. \"My brother Jim. You\u0027ll have to excuse him. He\u0027s been working the cattle.\" \"Sam handles the money, I handle the rest. You didn\u0027t tell me we were having company.\" He swaggered closer. He carried the scents of leather and tobacco, but she found nothing appealing about it.\\n\\n \"Such nice-looking company.\"\\n\\n \"I invited Miss Conway to lunch.\"\\n\\n \"And it was lovely, but I really should be getting back.\" And away, she thought, from Jim Carlson. \"You don\u0027t want to rush off the minute I get in.\" Grinning, Jim laid a duty hand on the polished surface of a small table. \"We don\u0027t get enough company here, at least not your kind. You\u0027re just as pretty as a picture.\" He glanced at his brother with a laugh Sarah didn\u0027t understand. \"Just as pretty as a picture.\" \"You\u0027d better wash up.\" Though his voice was mild, Carlson sent him a hard look. \"We have some business to discuss when I get back.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s all business with Sam.\" Jim winked at Sarah.\\n\\n \u0027Now, me, I got time for other things.\"\\n\\n Sarah swallowed a sigh of relief when Carlson took her elbow again. \"Good day, Mr. Carlson.\"\\n\\n Jim watched her retreating back. \"Yeah, good day to you. A real good day.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll have to excuse him.\" Carlson helped Sarah into the waiting buggy. \"Jim\u0027s a bit rough around the edges. I hope he didn\u0027t upset you.\"\\n\\n \"No, not at all,\" she said, struggling to keep a polite smile. With her hands folded in her lap, she began to chat about whatever came to mind.\\n\\n \"You seem to be adjusting well to your new life,\" Carlson commented.\\n\\n \"Actually, I\u0027m enjoying it.\"\\n\\n \"For selfish reasons, I\u0027m glad to hear it. I was afraid you\u0027d lose heart and leave.\" He let the horses prance as he turned to smile at her. \"I\u0027m very glad you\u0027re staying.\" He pulled up so that they could have a last look at the ranch from the rise. The house spread out, rising two stories, glowing pink in the sunlight, its small glass windows glimmering. Neat paddocks and outbuildings dotted the land, which was cut through by a blue stream and ringed by hills.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s lovely, Samuel. You must be very proud of it.\"\\n\\n \"Pride isn\u0027t always enough. A place like this needs to be shared. I\u0027ve regretted not having a family of my own to fill it. Until now I\u0027d nearly given up hoping I\u0027d find a woman to share it with me.\" He took her hand and brought it to his lips. \"Sarah, nothing would make me happier than if that woman were you.\"\\n\\n She wasn\u0027t sure she could speak, though she could hardly claim to be surprised. He\u0027d made no secret about the fact that he was courting her. She studied his face in silence. He was everything she had dreamed of. Handsome, dashing, dependable, successful. Now he was offering her everything she had dreamed of. A home, a family, a full and happy life. She wanted to say yes, to lift a hand to his cheek and smile. But she couldn\u0027t. She looked away, struggling to find the right words.\\n\\n She saw him then. He was hardly more than a silhouette on the horizon. An anonymous man on horseback.\\n\\n But she knew without seeing his face, without hearing his voice, that it was Jake. That knowledge alone made her pulse beat fast and her body yearn.\\n\\n Deliberately she turned away. \"Samuel, I can\u0027t begin to tell you how flattered I am by your offer.\"\\n\\n He sensed refusal, and though anger tightened within him, he only smiled. \"Please, don\u0027t give me an answer now. I\u0027d like you to think about it. Believe me, Sarah, I realize we\u0027ve known each other only a short time and your feelings might not be as strong as mine.\\n\\n Give me a chance to change that.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you.\" She didn\u0027t object when he kissed her hand again. \"I will think about it.\" That she promised herself. \"I\u0027m very grateful you\u0027re patient. There\u0027s so much on my mind right now. I\u0027ve nearly got my life under control again, and now that I\u0027m going to open the mine-\" \"The mine?\" His hand tightened on hers. \"You\u0027re going to open the mine?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" She gave him a puzzled look. \"Is something wrong?\"\\n\\n \"No, no, it\u0027s only that it\u0027s dangerous.\" It was a measure of his ambition that he was able to bring himself under control so quickly. \"And I\u0027m afraid doing so might distress you more than you realize. After all, the mine killed your father.\"\\n\\n \"I know. But it also gave him life. I feel strongly that he would have wanted me to continue there.\" \"Will you do something for me?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll try.\"\\n\\n \"Think about it carefully. You\u0027re too important to me. I would hate to have you waste yourself on an empty dream.\" With another smile, he clucked to the horses. \"And if you marry me, I\u0027ll see that the mine is worked without causing you any heartache.\"\\n\\n \"I will think about it.\" But her mind was crowded with other thoughts as she looked over her shoulder at the lone rider on the hill. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lawless/page-8.html","bookId":2686,"book":{"id":2686,"title":"Lawless","description":"Storyline: Lawless (Love by Design: Jack\u0027s Stories 0.5) \\n Filled with Nora\u0027s exquisite storytelling and memorable characters, this rare Western historical romance is a unique treat for Nora\u0027s many fans.
