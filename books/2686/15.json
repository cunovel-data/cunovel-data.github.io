{"id":70026,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"Carlson crossed the room until only the desk was between them. \"Sarah.\" His voice was almost a sigh, a sigh touched with patience. In his hand he carried a delicate cup filled with fragrant tea. But she noted that he had strapped on his gun. \"I realize how upset you must be after Jim\u0027s inexcusable behavior. Now, why don\u0027t you sit down, compose yourself?\" \"You killed my father,\" she repeated. It was rage she felt now, waves of it. \"That\u0027s ridiculous.\" The words were said gently. \"I haven\u0027t killed anyone. Here, my dear. I\u0027ve brought you some tea. It should help calm you.\" The quiet sincerity in his eyes caused her to falter. He must have sensed it, because he smiled and stepped forward. Instantly she backed away. \"Why was this in your desk?\" Carlson looked at the miniature in her hand. \"A woman should never intrude on a man\u0027s personal belongings.\" His voice became indulgent as he set the cup on the desk. \"But since you have, I\u0027ll confess. I can be faulted for being overly romantic, I suppose. The moment I saw it, I fell in love with you. The moment I saw your face, I wanted you.\" He held out a hand, palm up, as if he were asking for a dance. \"Come, Sarah, you can\u0027t condemn me for that.\" Confused, she shook her head. \"Tell me how this came to be in your drawer when it belonged to my father.\" Impatience clouded his face, and he dropped his hand to his side. \"Isn\u0027t baring my soul enough for you? You knew, right from the beginning, you knew the way I felt about you. You deceived me.\" There was more than impatience in his face now. Something else was building in him. Something that had the bright, hot taste of fear clogging her throat. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about, Samuel.\" She spaced her words carefully and kept her eyes on his. \"But you\u0027re right. I\u0027m upset, and I\u0027m not myself. I\u0027d prefer to go home now and discuss all of this later.\" With the miniature still clutched in her hand, she stepped around the desk and toward the door. The violence with which he grabbed her and shoved her back against the wall had her head reeling. \"It\u0027s too late. Jim\u0027s interference has changed everything. His interference, and your prying. I was patient with you, Sarah. Now it\u0027s too late.\" His face was close to hers-close enough for her to see clearly what was in his eyes. She wondered, as the blood drained slowly from her face, how it was that she\u0027d never seen it before. The madness was bright and deadly. She tried to speak and found she had to swallow first. \"Samuel, you\u0027re hurting me.\" \"I would have made you a queen.\" He took one hand and brought it up to stroke her face. She cringed, but his eyes warned her not to move. \"I would have given you everything a woman could want. Silk.\" He traced a finger over her cheekbone. \"Diamonds.\" Then he ran it lightly down her throat. \"Gold.\" His hand tightened abruptly around her windpipe. Before she could begin to struggle, it was loosened again. \"Gold, Sarah. It belonged to me, truly to me. My grandfather had no right to lose that part of my heritage. And your father...he had no right to deny me what was already mine.\" \"He did it for me.\" Perhaps she could calm him, if only she could remain calm herself, before it was too late. \"He only wanted to see that I was taken care of.\" \"Of course.\" He nodded, as if he were pleased that she understood. \"Of course he did. As I do. It would have been yours as much as mine. I would never have let you suffer because I had taken it back. As my wife, you would have had every luxury. We would have gone back east together. That was always my plan. I was going to follow you back east and court you. But you stayed. You should never have stayed, Sarah. This isn\u0027t the place for you. I knew it the moment I saw your picture. It was there, in that miserable little cabin, beside the cot. I found it while I was looking for the deed to the mine.\" His face changed again. He looked petulant now, like a boy who had been denied an extra piece of pie. \"I was very annoyed that my brother and Donley killed Matt. Clumsy. They were only to...convince him to turn over the deed. Then, of course, it was up to me to think of causing the cave-in to cover up what they\u0027d done. I never found the deed. But I found your picture.\" She didn\u0027t think he was aware of how viciously his fingers were digging into her arms. She was almost certain he was no longer aware of how much he was telling her. She remained silent and still, knowing her only hope now was time. \"Delicate,\" he murmured. \"Such a delicate face. The innocence shining in the eyes, the soft curve of the mouth. It was a lie, wasn\u0027t it, Sarah?\" The violence sprang back into his face, and she could only shake her head and wait. \"There was no delicacy, no innocence. You toyed with me, offering me smiles, only smiles, while you gave yourself to Redman like a whore. He should be dead for touching what belonged to me. You should both be dead.\" She prepared to scream. She prepared to fight for what she knew was her life. \"Sam!\" The banging on the door brought with it a mixture of fear and relief. Swearing, Carlson dragged Sarah to the door to unlock it. \"Goddamn it, I told you to go back and get rid of the wagon and team.\" \"Riders coming in.\" The sweat on Jim\u0027s face attested to the fact that he had already ridden, and ridden hard. \"It\u0027s Redman and the sheriff, with some men from town.\" He glanced at Sarah. \"They\u0027ll be looking for her.\" When Sarah tried to break away, Samuel locked an arm around her throat. \"You\u0027ve ruined everything, bringing her here.\" \"I only did it \u0027cause you wanted her. I could\u0027ve taken care of her back on the road. Hell, I could\u0027ve taken care of her the night we torched her shed, but you said you didn\u0027t want her hurt none.\" Carlson tightened his grip as Sarah clawed at his arm. Her vision grayed from lack of air. As if from a distance, she heard the voices, one mixing into the other. \"How long?\" \"Ten minutes, no more... Kill her now.\" \"Not here, you idiot... Hold them off... In the hills.\" Sarah\u0027s last thought before she lost consciousness was that Jake was coming, but too late. \"You listen to me.\" Barker stopped the men on the rise above the Carlson ranch. But it was Jake he was looking at. \"I know you\u0027d like to ride in there hellbent, but you take a minute to think. If they\u0027ve got her, we\u0027ve got to go slow.\" \"They\u0027ve got her.\" In his mind, the Carlson brothers were already dead. \"Then let\u0027s make sure we get her back in one piece. Will, I want you to break off, ease on over to the Barn. John, I\u0027d be obliged if you\u0027d circle around the back. I don\u0027t want any shooting until it\u0027s necessary.\" With a nod, he spurred his horse. Jim watched them coming and wiped the sweat off his brow. His men were all out on the range. Not that they\u0027d have been any good, he thought. The only one who\u0027d have backed them against the sheriff was Doney. And he was dead. Wetting his lips, he levered the rifle in the window. He had to wait until they got close. That was what Sam had told him. Wait until they got close. Then he was to kill as many as he could. Starting with Redman. Sweat dripped down into his eyes. His fingers twitched. Sam had sent Donley to kill Redman, Jim remembered. But it was Donley who\u0027d been buried. Now he was going to do it. He wet his lips when he caught Jake in the sight. He was going to do it right. But nerves had his finger jerking on the trigger. Jake felt the bullet whiz past his cheek. Like lightning, he kicked one foot free of the stirrup to slide halfway down the side of his horse. Gun drawn, he rode toward the house while Barker shouted orders. He could hear the men scrambling for cover and returning fire, but his mind was on one thing and one thing alone. Getting inside to Sarah. Outside the doors, he leaped off. When he kicked them open, his second gun was drawn. The hall and the foyer were empty. He could hear the shouts of men and peppering gunfire. With a quick glance for any sign of her, he started up the stairs. Jim Carlson\u0027s back was to him when he broke open the door. \"Where is she?\" Jake didn\u0027t flinch when a bullet from outside plowed into the wall beside him. From his crouched position, Jim turned slowly. \"Sam\u0027s got her.\" With a grin, he swung his rifle up. For months he\u0027d wanted another chance to kill Jake Redman. Now he took it. He was still grinning as he fell forward. Jake slid his smoking guns back in their holsters. Moving quickly, he began to search the house. Barker met him on the steps. \"She ain\u0027t here. I found this on the floor.\" In his hand he held Sarah\u0027s miniature. Jake\u0027s eyes flicked up to Barker\u0027s. They held there only seconds, but Barker knew he would never forget the look in them. Later he would tell his wife it was the look of a man whose soul had gotten loose. Turning on his heel, Jake headed outside, with Barker close behind. \"Oh, God.\" For the first time since Jake had known him, Barker moved with speed. Pushing past Jake, he raced to where two of his men were carrying Will Metcalf. \"He isn\u0027t dead.\" John Cody laid Will down and held his head. \"But we have to get him back to town, to the doc.\" Barker crouched down as Will\u0027s eyes fluttered open. \"You\u0027re going to be all right, son.\" \"Took me by surprise,\" Will managed, struggling not to gasp at the pain as Cody pressed a pad to the hole in his shoulder. \"Was Sam Carlson, Sheriff. He had her-I saw he had her on the horse. Think they headed west.\" \"Good job, Will.\" Barker used his own bandanna to wipe the sweat off his deputy\u0027s brow. \"One of you men hitch up a wagon, get some blankets. You get this boy to the doctor, John. Redman and I\u0027ll go after Carlson.\" But when he stood, all he saw of Jake was the dust his mustang kicked up as he galloped west. Sarah came to slowly, nausea rising in her throat. Moaning, she choked it back and tried to lift a hand to her spinning head. Both wrists were bound tight to the saddle horn. For a. moment she thought she was still with Jim. Then she remembered. The horse was climbing, picking its way up through dusty, dung-colored rock. She watched loose dirt and stones dislodged by the horse\u0027s hooves fall down a dizzying ravine. The man behind her was breathing hard. Fighting for calm, she tried to mark the trail they were taking and remember it. When she escaped-and she would-she didn\u0027t intend to wander helplessly through the rocks. He stopped the horse near the edge of a canyon. She could see the thin silver line of a river far below. An eagle called as he swooped into the wide opening, then returned to a nest built in the high rock wall. \"Samuel, please-\" She cried out when he pulled the rope from around her wrists and dragged her roughly to the ground. One look warned her that the calm, sane words she had meant to use would never reach him. There was a bright, glazed light in his eyes. His face was pale and drenched with sweat. His hair was dark with it. She watched his eyes dart here and there, as if he expected something to leap out from behind a huddle of rock. The man who had swept off his hat and kissed her fingers wasn\u0027t here with her now. If he had ever been part of Samuel Carlson, he had vanished. The man who stood over her was mad, and as savage as any beast that lived in the hills. \"What are you going to do?\" \"He\u0027s coming.\" Still breathing rapidly, Carlson swiped a hand over his mouth. \"I saw him behind us. When he comes for you, I\u0027ll be ready.\" He reached down to drag her to her feet. \"I\u0027m going to kill him, Sarah. Kill him like a dog.\" He pulled out his gun and rubbed the barrel against her cheek, gently, like a caress. \"You\u0027re going to watch. I want you to watch me kill him. Then you\u0027ll understand. It\u0027s important that you understand. A man like that deserves to die by a gun. He\u0027s nothing, less than nothing. A crude gunslinger with Indian blood. He put his hands on you.\" A whimper escaped her as he dragged a hand through her hair. \"I\u0027m going to kill him for you, Sarah. Then we\u0027re going away, you and I.\" \"No.\" She wrenched free. The canyon was at her back when she faced him. If she had stumbled another step she would have fallen back into nothing. There was fear. The taste of it was bitter in her throat. But it wasn\u0027t for herself. Jake would come, she knew, and someone would die. \"I won\u0027t go anywhere with you. It\u0027s over, Samuel. You must see that. They know what you\u0027ve done, and they\u0027ll hunt you down.\" \"A potbellied sheriff?\" He laughed and, before she could evade him, closed his hand over her arm. \"Not likely. This is a big country, Sarah. They won\u0027t find us.\" \"I won\u0027t go with you.\" The pain when he squeezed her arm nearly buckled her knees. \"I\u0027ll get away.\" \"If I must, I\u0027ll keep you locked up, the way my mother was locked up. For your own good.\" She heard the horse even as he did and screamed out a warning. \"No, Jake, he\u0027ll kill you!\" Then she screamed again, this time in pain, as Carlson bent her arm behind her back. Calmly he put the gun to her temple. \"It\u0027s her I\u0027ll kill, Redman. Come out slow and keep your hands where I can see them, or the first bullet goes in her brain.\" He twisted her arm ruthlessly because he wanted Jake to hear her cry out again. He wanted Jake to hear the pain. \"Now, Redman, or I\u0027ll kill her and toss her body over the edge.\" \"No. Oh, no.\" Tears blurred her vision as she watched Jake step out into the open. \"Please don\u0027t. It won\u0027t gain you anything to kill him. I\u0027ll go with you.\" She tried to turn her head to look into Carlson\u0027s eyes. \"I\u0027ll go anywhere you want.\" \"Not gain anything?\" Carlson laughed again, and it echoed off the rocks and air. \"Satisfaction, my dear. I\u0027ll gain satisfaction.\" \"Are you hurt?\" Jake asked quietly. \"No.\" She shook her head, praying she could will him back behind the rock, back to safety. \"No, he hasn\u0027t hurt me. He won\u0027t if you go back.\" \"But you\u0027re wrong, my dear, quite wrong.\" Carlson bent his head close to hers, amused by the quick fury in Jake\u0027s eyes when he brushed his lips over Sarah\u0027s hair. \"I\u0027ll have to, you see, because you won\u0027t understand. Unless I kill him for you, you won\u0027t understand. Your gunbelt, Redman.\" Carlson drew back the hammer for emphasis and kept the gun tight against Sarah\u0027s temple. \"Take it off, slowly, very slowly, and kick it aside.\" \"No!\" She began to struggle, only to have him drag her arm farther up her back. \"I\u0027ll kill you myself.\" She wept in rage and fear. \"I swear it.\" \"When I\u0027m done here, my dear, you\u0027ll do exactly what I say, when I say. In time you\u0027ll understand this was for the best. Drop the belt, Redman.\" Carlson smiled at him and jerked his head to indicate that he wanted the guns kicked away. \"That\u0027s fine.\" He took the gun away from Sarah\u0027s temple to point it at Jake\u0027s heart. \"You know, I\u0027ve never killed a man before. It always seemed more civilized to hire someone- someone like yourself.\" His smile widened. \"But I believe I\u0027m going to enjoy it a great deal.\" \"You might.\" Jake watched his eyes. He could only hope Sarah had the sense to run when it was over. Barker couldn\u0027t be far behind. \"Maybe you\u0027ll enjoy it more when I tell you I killed your brother.\" The muscles in Carlson\u0027s cheek twitched. \"You bastard.\" Sarah screamed and threw her weight against his gun hand. She felt the explosion, as if the bullet had driven into her. Then she was on her knees. Life poured out of her when she saw Jake sprawled on the ground, blood seeping from his side. \"No. Oh, God, no.\" Carlson threw back his head and laughed at the sky. \"I was right. I enjoyed it. But he\u0027s not dead yet. Not quite yet.\" His lips stretched back from his teeth as he lifted the gun again. She didn\u0027t think. There was no room for thought in a mind swamped with grief. She reached out and felt the smooth grip of Jake\u0027s gun in her hand. Kneeling in the dirt, she balanced it and aimed. \"Samuel,\" she murmured, and waited for him to turn his head. The gun jumped in her hand when she fired. The sound of the shot echoed on and on and on. He just stared at her. Afraid she\u0027d missed, Sarah drew back the hammer and calmly prepared to fire again. Then he stumbled. He stared at her as his hand.; reached up to press against the blood that blossomed I on his shirtfront. Without a sound, he fell back. He groped once in the air, then tumbled off the edge and into the canyon. Her hand went limp on the gun. Then the shudders began, racking shudders, as she crawled to Jake. He\u0027d pushed himself upon one elbow, and he held his knife in his hand. She was weeping as she tore at her petticoats to pad the wound in his side. \"I thought he\u0027d killed you. You looked-\" There was so much blood, she thought frantically as she tore more cloth. \"You need a doctor. I\u0027ll get you on the horse as soon as-\" She broke off again as her voice began to hitch. \"It was crazy, absolutely crazy, for you to come out in the open like that. I thought you had more sense.\" \"So did I.\" The pain was searing, centering in his side and flowing out in waves of heat. He wanted to touch her, just once more, before he died. \"Sarah...\" \"Don\u0027t talk.\" Tears clogged her throat. His blood seeped through the pad and onto her hands. \"Just lie still. I\u0027m going to take care of you. Damn you, I won\u0027t let you die.\" He couldn\u0027t see her face. Tired of the effort, he closed his eyes. He thought, but couldn\u0027t be sure, that he heard horses coming. \"You\u0027re a hell of a woman,\" he murmured, and passed out. When he awoke, it was dark. There was a bitter taste in his mouth and a hollow throbbing at the base of his skull. The pain in his side was still there, but dull now, and constant. He lay still and wondered how long he\u0027d been in hell. He closed his eyes again, thinking it didn\u0027t matter how long he\u0027d been there, since he wouldn\u0027t be leaving. Then he smelled her, smelled the soft scent that was Sarah. Though it cost him dearly, he opened his eyes again and tried to sit up. \"No, don\u0027t.\" She was there, murmuring to him, pressing him gently back on a pillow, then laying a cool cloth against his hot face. \"How long-\" He could only manage two whispered words before the strength leaked out of him. \"Don\u0027t worry.\" Cradling his head with her arm, she brought a cup to his lips. \"Drink a little. Then you\u0027ll sleep again. I\u0027m right here with you,\" she continued when he coughed and tried to turn his head away. \"Can\u0027t-\" He tried to focus on her face, but saw only a silhouette. It was Sarah, though. \"Can\u0027t be in hell,\" he murmured, then sank back into the darkness... When he awoke again, it was daylight. And she was there, leaning over him, smiling, murmuring something he couldn\u0027t quite understand. But there were tears drying on her cheeks, cheeks that were too pale. She sat beside him, took his hand and held it against her lips. Even as he struggled to speak, he lost consciousness again. She thought it would drive her mad, the way he drifted in and out of consciousness that first week, with the fever burning through him and the doctor giving her no hope. Hour after hour, day after day, she sat beside him, bathing his hot skin, soothing when the chills racked him, praying when he fell back into that deep, silent sleep. What had he said that day when he\u0027d awakened? Pacing to the window, the one Maggie had told her Jake had sometimes sat in, she drew the curtain aside to look down at the empty street. He\u0027d said it couldn\u0027t be hell. But he\u0027d been wrong, Sarah thought. It was hell, and she was mired in it, terrified each day that he would leave her. So much blood. He\u0027d lost so much blood. By the time Barker had ridden up she\u0027d nearly managed to stop it, but the ride back to town had cost him more. She had stanched still more while the doctor had cut and probed into his side to remove the bullet. She hadn\u0027t known that watching the bullet come out of him would be as bad as watching it go in. Then the fever had raced through him, vicious and merciless. In a week he\u0027d been awake only a handful of minutes, often delirious, sometimes speaking in what Lucius had told her was Apache. If it didn\u0027t break soon, she knew, no matter how hard she prayed, no matter how hard she fought, it would take him. Sarah moved back to the bed to sit beside him and watch over him in the pale light of dawn. Time drifted, for her even as it did for him. She lost track of minutes, then hours, then days. When morning came she held his hand in hers and thought over the time they\u0027d had together. His hands had been strong, she thought. Biting back a sob, she laid her forehead on his shoulder. And gentle, too, she remembered. When he\u0027d touched her. When he\u0027d taught her. With him she\u0027d found something lovely, something powerful. A sunrise. A fast river. A storm. She knew now that love, desire, passion and affection could be one emotion for one man. From that first frantic discovery in the hay to the soft, sweet loving by the stream, he\u0027d given her more than most women had in a lifetime. \"But I\u0027m greedy,\" she murmured to him. \"I want more. Jake, don\u0027t leave me. Don\u0027t cheat me out of what we could have.\" She blinked back tears when she heard the door open behind her. \"How is he?\" \"The same.\" Sarah rose,and waited while Maggie set a tray on the bureau. She\u0027d long ago stopped arguing about eating. It had taken her only a few days to realize that if she wanted the strength to stay with Jake she needed food. \"Don\u0027t worry none about this breakfast, because Anne Cody made it up for you.\" Sarah dashed away the hated, weakening tears. \"That was kind of her.\" \"She asked about our boy here, and wanted you to know that Alice is doing just fine.\" \"I\u0027m glad.\" Without interest, she folded back the cloth so that steam rose fragrantly from the biscuits. \"Looks like Carlotta skipped town.\" \"It doesn\u0027t matter.\" With no more interest than she had in the biscuits, she looked at her own face in the mirror. Behind her reflection, she could see Jake lying motionless in the bed. \"The damage is done.\" \"Child, you need sleep, and not what you get sitting up in that chair all night. You go on and use my room. I\u0027ll stay with him.\" \"I can\u0027t.\" Sarah ignored the biscuits and took the coffee. \"Sometimes he calls for me, and I\u0027m afraid if I\u0027m not here he might...slip away. That\u0027s foolish, I suppose, but I just can\u0027t leave him, Maggie.\" \"I know.\" Because she did, Maggie set a comforting hand on Sarah\u0027s shoulder. The noise at the door had her turning back. \"What are you doing sneaking around here, young John Cody?\" Johnny slipped into the doorway and stood with his hat crushed in his hands. \"Just wanted to see him, is all.\" \"A sickroom ain\u0027t no place for nasty little boys.\" \"It\u0027s all right.\" Sarah waved him in and summoned up a smile. \"I\u0027m sure Jake would be pleased that you\u0027d taken the time to visit him.\" \"He ain\u0027t going to die, is he, Sarah?\" \"No.\" She found the confidence she\u0027d lost during the night. \"No, he isn\u0027t going to die, Johnny.\" \"Ma says you\u0027re taking real good care of him.\" He reached out a hand, then balled it at his side again. \"It\u0027s all right, boy,\" Maggie said, softening. \"You can pet him as long as he don\u0027t know it. I do it myself.\" Gingerly Johnny stroked a hand along Jake\u0027s forehead. \"He\u0027s pretty hot.\" \"Yes, but the fever\u0027s going to break soon.\" Sarah laid a hand on Johnny\u0027s shoulder. \"Very soon.\" \"Will\u0027s better,\" he said, giving Sarah a hopeful smile. \"He\u0027s got his arm in a sling and-all, but he\u0027s getting around just fine and dandy. Won\u0027t even let Liza fuss no more.\" \"Before long Jake won\u0027t let me fuss, either.\" Hours later she dozed, lulled by the afternoon sun. She slept lightly, her head nestled against the wing of the chair and her hands in her lap on top of her journal. She\u0027d written everything she felt, hoped, despaired of on those pages. Someone called her name, and she lifted a hand as if to brush the voice away. She only wanted to sleep. \"Sarah.\" Now her eyes flew open, and she bolted out of the chair. Jake was half sitting up in bed, his brows drawn together in annoyance or confusion. And his eyes, she noted, were focused, alert and direct on hers. \"What the hell\u0027s going on?\" he asked her. Then he watched, astonished, as she collapsed on the side of the bed and wept. It was three weeks before he had the strength to do more than stand on his own feet. He had time to think-perhaps too much time-but when he tried to do anything he found himself weak as a baby. It infuriated him, disgusted him. When he swore at Maggie twice in one morning, she told Sarah their patient was well on the road to recovery. \"He\u0027s a tough one, Jake is,\" Maggie went on as they climbed the steps to his room together. \"Said he was damn sick and tired of having females poking him, pouring things into him and trying to give him baths.\" \"So much for gratitude,\" Sarah said with a laugh. Then she swayed and clutched the banister for support. Maggie grabbed her arm. \"Honey, are you all right?\" \"Yes. Silly.\" Shrugging it off, Sarah waited for the dizziness to pass. \"I\u0027m just tired yet, I think.\" One look at Maggie\u0027s shrewd face had her giving up and sitting carefully on the riser. \"How far along are you?\" It surprised Sarah that the direct question didn\u0027t make her blush. Instead, she smiled. \"About a month.\" She knew the exact moment when she had conceived Jake\u0027s child, on the riverbank under the moon. \"I had the obvious sign, of course. Then, for the last few days, I haven\u0027t been able to keep anything down in the morning.\" \"I know.\" Pleased as a partridge, Maggie cackled. \"Honey, I knew you were breeding three days ago, when you turned green at the sight of Anne Cody\u0027s flapjacks. Ain\u0027t Jake just going to fall on his face?\" \"I haven\u0027t told him,\" Sarah said quickly. \"I don\u0027t want him to know until he\u0027s...until we\u0027ve...\" She propped her chin in her hands. \"Not yet, Maggie.\" \"That\u0027s for you to decide.\" \"Yes, and you won\u0027t say any thing... to anyone?\" \"Not a peep.\" Satisfied, Sarah rose and started up the stairs again. \"The doctor said he\u0027d be up and around in a couple of days. We haven\u0027t been able to talk about anything important since he\u0027s been healing.\" She knocked on the door to his room before pushing it open. The bed was empty. \"What-Maggie!\" \"He was there an hour ago. I don\u0027t know where-\" But she was talking to air, as Sarah was flying down the stairs again. \"Sarah! Sarah!\" His hand wrapped around a licorice whip, Johnny raced toward her. \"I just saw Jake riding out of town. He sure looked a lot better.\" \"Which way?\" She grabbed the surprised boy by the shoulders. \"Which way did he go?\" \"That way.\" He pointed. \"I called after him, but I guess he didn\u0027t hear me.\" \"Damned hardheaded man,\" Maggie muttered from the doorway. \"So he thinks he can just ride off,\" Sarah said between her teeth. \"Well, Jake Redman is in for a surprise. I need a horse, Maggie. And a rifle.\" He\u0027d thought it through. He\u0027d had nothing but time to think over the last weeks. She\u0027d be mad, he figured. He almost smiled. Mad enough to spit, he imagined, but she\u0027d get over it. In time she\u0027d find someone who was right for her. Who was good for her. Talking to her wouldn\u0027t have helped. He\u0027d never known a more stubborn woman. So he\u0027d saddled up and ridden out of Lone Bluff the way he\u0027d ridden out of countless towns before. Only this time it hurt. Not just the pain from his still-healing wound, but an ache deeper, sharper, than anything that could be caused by a bullet. He\u0027d get over it, too, he told himself. He\u0027d just been fooling himself, letting himself pretend that she could belong to him. He\u0027d never forget how she\u0027d looked, kneeling in the dirt with his gun in her hand. His gun. And there had been horror in her eyes. He\u0027d taught her to kill, and he wasn\u0027t sure he could live with that. The way he figured it, she\u0027d saved his life. The best he could do for her was return the favor and get out of hers. She was rich now. Jake remembered how excited Lucius had been when he\u0027d come to visit, talking on and on about the mine and how the gold was all but ready to fall into a man\u0027s hands. She could go back east, or she could stay and build that big house with the parlor she\u0027d told him about. And he would...he would go on drifting. When he heard the rider coming, instinct had him wheeling his horse around and reaching for his gun. He swore, rubbing his hand on his thigh, as Sarah closed the distance between them. \"You bastard.\" He acknowledged her with a nod. There was only one way to handle her now, one way to make certain she turned around and left. Before just looking at her made him want to crawl. \"Didn\u0027t know you could ride, Duchess. You come out all this way to tell me goodbye?\" \"I have more than that to say.\" Her hands balled on the reins while she fought with her temper. \"Not a word, Jake, to me, to anyone? Just saddle up and ride out?\" \"That\u0027s right. When it\u0027s time to move on, you move.\" \"So you\u0027re telling me you have no reason to stay?\" \"That\u0027s right.\" He knew the truth sometimes hurt, but he hadn\u0027t known a lie could. \"You\u0027re a mighty pretty woman, Duchess. You\u0027ll be hard to top.\" He saw the hurt glow in her eyes before her chin came up. \"That\u0027s a compliment? Well, you\u0027re quite right, Jake. I\u0027ll be very hard to top. You\u0027ll never love another woman the way you love me. Or want one,\" she said, more quietly. \"Or need one.\" \"Go on back, Sarah.\" He started to turn his horse but stopped short when she drew the rifle out of its holster and aimed it heart-high. \"You want to point that someplace else?\" For an answer, she lowered it a few strategic inches, smiling when his brow lifted. \"Ever hear the one about hell\u0027s fury, Jake?\" \"I get the idea.\" He shifted slightly. \"Duchess, if it\u0027s all the same to you, I\u0027d rather you pointed it back at my chest.\" \"Get off your horse.\" \"Damn it, Sarah.\" \"I said off.\" She cocked the lever in two sharp movements. \"Now.\" He leaned forward in the saddle. \"How do I know that\u0027s even loaded?\" \"How do you know it\u0027s loaded?\" She smiled, brought it up to her eye and fired. His hat flew off his head. \"Are you crazy?\" Stunned, he dragged a hand through his hair. He could almost feel the heat. \"You damn near killed me.\" \"I hit what I aim at. Isn\u0027t that what you said I should learn to do?\" She cocked the rifle again. \"Now get off that horse before I shoot something more vital off you.\" Swearing, he slid down. \"What the hell are you trying to prove with all this?\" \"Just hold it right there.\" She dropped to the ground. Giddiness washed over her, and she had to lean one hand against her mount. \"Sarah-\" \"I said hold it right there.\" She shook her head to clear it. \"Are you sick?\" \"No.\" Steady again, she smiled. \"I\u0027ve never felt better in my life.\" \"Just crazy, then.\" He relaxed a little, but her pallor worried him. \"Well, if you\u0027ve a mind to kill me after spending the better part of a month keeping me alive, go ahead.\" \"You\u0027re damn right I kept you alive, and I didn\u0027t do it so you could leave me the minute you could stand up. I did it because I love you, because you\u0027re everything I want and everything I intend to have. Now you tell me, you stand there and tell me why you left.\" \"I already told you. It was time.\" \"You\u0027re a bar. Worse, you\u0027re a coward.\" Her words had the effect she\u0027d hoped for. The cool, almost bored look in his eyes sizzled into heat. \"Don\u0027t push me, Sarah.\" \"I haven\u0027t begun to push you. I\u0027ll start by telling you why you got on that horse and rode away. You left because you were afraid. Of me. No, not even of me, of yourself and what you feel for me.\" Her chin was up, a challenge in her eyes as she dared him to say it was untrue. \"You loved me enough to stand unarmed in front of a madman, but not enough to face your own heart.\" \"You don\u0027t know what I feel.\" \"Don\u0027t I? If you believe that, you\u0027re a fool, as well as a liar.\" The fresh flash of fury in his eyes delighted her. \"Don\u0027t you think I knew every time you touched me, every time you kissed me?\" He was silent, and she drew a long breath. \"Well, you can get on that horse and you can ride, you can run into the hills, to the next town. You can keep running until you\u0027re hundreds of miles away. Maybe you\u0027ll be fast enough, just fast enough to get away from me. But before you do you\u0027re going to tell me.\" \"Tell you what?\" \"I want you to tell me you love me.\" He studied her. Her eyes glowed with determination, and her cheeks were flushed with anger. Her hair, caught by the wind, was blowing back. He should have known then and there that he\u0027d never had anywhere to run. \"A man\u0027ll say most anything when a woman\u0027s pointing a rifle at his belly.\" \"Then say it.\" He bent to pick up his hat, slapping it against his thighs twice to loosen the dust. Idly he poked his finger through the hole in the crown. \"I love you, Sarah.\" He settled the hat on his head. \"Now do you want to put that thing away?\" The temper went out of her eyes, and with it the glint of hope. Without a word, she turned to secure the rifle in the holder. \"Well, I had to threaten it out of you, but at least I heard you say it once. Go ahead and ride off. I won\u0027t stop you. No one\u0027s holding a gun on you now.\" She wouldn\u0027t cry. No, she swore to herself she wouldn\u0027t hold him with tears. Fighting them back, she tried to struggle back into the saddle. He touched her arm, lightly, not holding, when he wanted more than anything he\u0027d ever wanted in his life to hold her. \"I love you, Sarah,\" he said again. \"More than I should. A hell of a lot more than I can stand.\" She closed her eyes, praying that what she did now would be right for both of them. Slowly she turned toward him, but she kept her hands at her sides. \"If you ride away now, I\u0027ll come after you. No matter where you go, I\u0027ll be there. I\u0027ll make your life hell, I swear it.\" He couldn\u0027t stop the smile any more than he could stop his hand from reaching up to touch her face. \"And if I don\u0027t ride away?\" \"I\u0027ll only make your life hell some of the time.\" \"I guess that\u0027s a better bargain.\" He lowered his head to kiss her gently. Then, with a groan, he crushed her hard against him. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027d\u0027ve gotten very far, even if you hadn\u0027t shot at me.\" \"No use taking chances. Lucky for you I was trying to shoot over your head.\" He only sighed and drew her away. \"You owe me a hat, Duchess.\" Still amazed, he drew it off to poke at the hole. \"I guess I\u0027d have to marry any woman who could handle a gun like that.\" \"Is that a proposal?\" He shrugged and stuck his hat back on his head. \"Sounded like it.\" She lifted a brow. \"And it\u0027s the best you can do?\" \"I haven\u0027t got any five-dollar words.\" Disgusted, he started back to his horse. Then he stopped and turned back. She was waiting, her arms folded, a half smile on her face. So he swore at her. \"There\u0027s a preacher comes into town once every few weeks. He can marry us proper enough, with whatever kind of fuss you figure would satisfy you. I\u0027ll build you a house, between the mine and the town, with a parlor if that\u0027s what you want, and a wood floor, and a real bedroom.\" To her it was the most eloquent of proposals. She held out her hands. \"We\u0027ll need two.\" \"Two what?\" \"Two bedrooms,\" she said when his hands closed over hers again. \"Listen, Duchess, I\u0027ve heard they\u0027ve got some odd ways of doing things back east, but I\u0027m damned if my wife is going to sleep in another room.\" \"Oh, no.\" Her smile lit up her face. \"I\u0027m going to sleep in the same room, the same bed as you, every night for the rest of my life. But we\u0027ll need two bedrooms. At least we will by spring.\" \"I don\u0027t see why-\" Then he did, so abruptly, so stunningly, that he could only stare at her. If she had taken the rifle back out and driven it butt first into his gut he would have been less shaken. His fingers went slack on hers, then dropped away. \"Are you sure?\" \"Yes.\" She held her breath. \"There\u0027s going to be a child. Our child.\" He wasn\u0027t sure he could move, and was less sure he could speak. Slowly, carefully, he framed her face with his hands and kissed her. Then, when emotions swamped him, he simply rested his forehead against hers. \"Two bedrooms,\" he murmured. \"To start.\" Content, she wrapped her arms around his waist. \"Yes. To start.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lawless/page-15.html","bookId":2686,"book":{"id":2686,"title":"Lawless","description":"Storyline: Lawless (Love by Design: Jack\u0027s Stories 0.5) Filled with Nora\u0027s exquisite storytelling and memorable characters, this rare Western historical romance is a unique treat for Nora\u0027s many fans.
