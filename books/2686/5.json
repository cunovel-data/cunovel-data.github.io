{"id":70016,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"He\u0027d figured a challenge would be the best way to get her cooperation. Sarah marched along beside him, chin up, eyes forward. He didn\u0027t think she knew it, but when she\u0027d held the rifle that morning she\u0027d been prepared to pull the trigger. He wanted to make sure that when she did she hit what she aimed at.\n From the rubble of the burned shed, Jake selected a few pieces of charred wood and balanced three of them against a pile of rocks.\n \"First thing you do is learn how to load it without shooting off your foot.\" Jake emptied the rifle\u0027s chamber, then slowly reloaded. \"You\u0027ve got to have respect for a weapon, and not go around holding it like you were going to sweep the porch with it.\"\n To prove his point, he brought the rifle up, sighted in and fired three shots. The three pieces of scrap wood flew backward in unison. \"Bullets can do powerful damage to a man,\" he told her as he lowered the gun again.\n She had to swallow. The sound of gunfire still echoed. \"I\u0027m aware of that, Mr. Redman. I have no intention of shooting anyone.\"\n \"Most people don\u0027t wake up in the morning figuring on it.\" He went to the rocks again. This time he set up the largest piece of wood. \"Unless you\u0027re planning on heading back to Philadelphia real soon, you\u0027d better learn how to use this.\"\n \"I\u0027m not going anywhere.\"\n With a nod, Jake emptied the rifle and handed her the ammo. \"Load it.\"\n She didn\u0027t like the feel of the bullets in her hands. They were cold and smooth. Holding them, she wondered how anyone could use them against another.\n Metal against flesh. No, it was inconceivable.\n \"You going to play with them or put them in the gun?\"\n Because he was watching her, Sarah kept her face impassive and did as he told her.\n He pushed the barrel away from his midsection.\n \"You\u0027re a quick study.\"\n It shouldn\u0027t have pleased her, but she felt the corners of her mouth turn up nonetheless. \"So I\u0027ve been told.\"\n Unable to resist, he brushed the hair out of her eyes. \"Don\u0027t get cocky.\" Stepping behind her, he laid the gun in her hands, then adjusted her arms. \"Balance it and get a good grip on it.\"\n \"I am,\" she muttered, wishing he wouldn\u0027t stand quite so close. He smelled of leather and sweat, a combination that, for reasons beyond her comprehension, aroused her. One hand was firm on her arm, the other on her shoulder. Hardly a lover\u0027s touch, and yet she felt her system respond as it had never responded to the gentle, flirtatious hand-holding she\u0027d experienced in Philadelphia. She had only to lean back the slightest bit to be pressed close against him.\n Not that she wanted to be. She shifted, then grumbled under her breath when he pushed her into place again.\n \"Hold still. Not stiff, woman, still,\" he told her when her body went rigid at his touch.\n \"There\u0027s no need to snap at me.\"\n \"You stand like that when you fire, you\u0027re going to get a broken shoulder. Loosen up. You see the sight?\" \"That little thing sticking up there?\"\n He closed his eyes for a moment. \"Yeah, that little thing sticking up there. Use it to sight in the target. Bring the stock up some.\" He leaned over. Sarah pressed her lips together when his cheek brushed hers. \"Steady,\" he murmured, resisting the urge to turn his face into her hair. \"Wrap your finger around the trigger. Don\u0027t jerk it, just pull it back, slow and smooth.\" She shut her eyes and obeyed. The rifle exploded in her hands and would have knocked her flat on her back if he hadn\u0027t been there to steady her. She screamed, afraid she\u0027d shot herself.\n \"Missed.\"\n Breathing hard, Sarah whirled around. Always a cautious man, Jake took the rifle from her. \"You might have warned me.\" She brought her hand up to nurse her bruised shoulder. \"It felt like someone hit me with a rock.\"\n \"It\u0027s always better to find things out firsthand. Try it again.\"\n With her teeth clenched, Sarah took the rifle and managed to get back into position.\n \"This time use your arm instead of your shoulder to balance it. Lean in a bit.\"\n \"My ears are ringing.\"\n \"You\u0027ll get used to it.\" He put a steadying hand on her waist. \"It helps if you keep your eyes open. Sight low. Good. Now pull the trigger.\"\n This time she was braced for the kick and just staggered a little. Jake kept a hand at her waist and looked over her head. \"You caught a corner of it.\"\n \"I did?\" She looked for herself. \"I did!\" Laughing, she looked over her shoulder at him. \"I want to do it again.\" She lifted the rifle and didn\u0027t complain when Jake pushed the barrel three inches to the right. She kept her eyes wide open this time as she pressed her finger down on the trigger. She let out a whoop when the wood flew off the rocks. \"I hit it.\"\n \"Looks like.\"\n \"I really nit it. Imagine.\" When he took the gun from her, she shook her hair back and laughed. \"My arm\u0027s tingling.\"\n \"It\u0027ll pass.\" He was surprised he could speak. The way she looked when she laughed made his throat slam shut. He wasn\u0027t a man for pretty words, not for saying them or for thinking them. But just now it ran through his head that she looked like an angel in the sunlight, with her hair the color of wet wheat and her eyes like gold dust.\n And he wanted her, as he\u0027d wanted few \"things in his life. Slowly, wanting to give himself time to regain control, he walked over to the rocks to pick up the target. She had indeed hit it. The hole was nearly at the top, and far to the right of center, but she\u0027d hit it. He walked back to drop the wood in Sarah\u0027s hands and watched her grin about it.\n \"Trouble is, most things you shoot at don\u0027t sit nice and still like a block of wood.\"\n He was determined to spoil it for her, Sarah thought, studying his cool, unreadable eyes. The man was impossible to understand. One moment he was going to the trouble to teach her how to shoot the rifle, and the next he couldn\u0027t even manage the smallest of compliments because she\u0027d learned well. The devil with him. \"Mr. Redman, it\u0027s very apparent that nothing I do pleases you.\" She tossed the block of wood aside. \"Isn\u0027t it fortunate for both of us that it doesn\u0027t matter in the least?\" With that she gathered up her skirts and began to stamp back toward the house. She managed no more than a startled gasp as he spun her around. She knew that look, she thought dazedly as she stared at him. It was the same one she\u0027d first seen on his face, when he\u0027d ridden beside the stage, firing his pistol over his shoulder. She hadn\u0027t a clue as to how to deal with him now, so she took the only option that came to mind.\n \"Take your hands off me.\"\n \"I warned you, you took too many chances.\" His grip only tightened when she tried to shrug him off. \"It\u0027s not smart to turn your back on a man who\u0027s holding a loaded gun.\"\n \"Did you intend to shoot me in the back, Mr. Redman?\"\n It was an unfair remark, and she knew it. But she wanted to get away from him, quickly, until that look faded from his eyes. \"I wouldn\u0027t put that, or anything else, past you. You\u0027re the rudest, most ill-mannered, most ungentlemanly man I\u0027ve ever met. I\u0027ll thank you to get back on your horse and ride off my land.\"\n He\u0027d resisted challenges before, but he\u0027d be damned if he\u0027d resist this one. From the first time he\u0027d seen her she\u0027d started an itch in him. It was time he scratched it.\n \"Seems to me you need another lesson, Duchess.\"\n \"I neither need nor want anything from you. And I won\u0027t be called by that ridiculous name.\" Her breath came out in a whoosh when he dragged her against him. He saw her eyes go wide with shock.\n \"Then I won\u0027t call you anything.\" He was still holding the rifle. With his eyes on hers, he slid his hand up her back to gather up her hair. \"I don\u0027t much like talking, anyway.\"\n She fought him. At least she needed to believe she did. Despite her efforts, his mouth closed over hers. In that instant the sun was blocked out and she was plunged, breathless, into the deepest, darkest night. His body was like iron. His arm bonded her against him so that she had no choice, really no choice, but to absorb the feel of him. He made her think of the rifle, slim and hard and deadly. Through the shock, the panic and the excitement she felt the fast, uneven beating of his heart against hers.\n Her blood had turned into some hot, foreign liquid that made her pulse leap and her heart thud. The rough stubble of his beard scraped her face, and she moaned. From the pain, she assured herself. It couldn\u0027t be from pleasure.\n And yet... Her hands were on his shoulders, holding on now rather than pushing away.\n He wondered if she knew she packed a bigger kick than her father\u0027s rifle. He\u0027d never known that anything so sweet could be so potent. That anything so delicate could be so strong. She had him by the throat and didn\u0027t even know it. And he wanted more. In a move too desperate to be gentle, he dragged her head back by the hair.\n She gasped in the instant he allowed her to breathe, dragging in air, unaware that she\u0027d been stunned into holding her breath. Then his mouth was on hers again, his tongue invading, arousing in a way she hadn\u0027t known she could be aroused, weakening in a way she hadn\u0027t believed she could be weakened.\n She moaned again, but this time there was no denying the pleasure. Tentatively, then boldly, she answered the new demand. Savoring the hot, salty taste of his lips, she ran her hands along the planes of his face and into his hair. Glorious. No one had ever warned her that a kiss could make the body burn and tremble and yearn. A sound of stunned delight caught in her throat.\n The sound lit fires in him that he knew could never be allowed to burn free. She was innocent. Any fool could see that. Arid he...he hadn\u0027t been innocent since he\u0027d drawn his first breath. There were lines he crossed, laws he broke. But this one had to be respected.\n He struggled to clear his mind, but she filled it. Her arms were around his neck, pulling him closer, pulling him in. And her mouth... Sweet Lord, her mouth. His heart was hammering in his head, in his loins...all from the taste of her. Honeyed whiskey. A man could drown in it.\n Afraid he would, and even more afraid he\u0027d want to, he pushed her away. Her eyes were dark and unfocused the way they\u0027d been last night, when she\u0027d started to come to. It gave him some satisfaction to see it, because he felt as though he\u0027d been knocked cold, himself.\n \"Like I said, you learn fast, Sarah.\" His hand was shaking. Infuriated, he curled it into a fist. He had a flash, an almost painful one, of what it would be like to drag her to the ground and take everything from her. Before he could act, one way or the other, he heard the sound of an approaching wagon. \"You got company coming.\" He handed her the rifle and walked away.\n What had he done to her? Sarah put a hand to her spinning head. He\u0027d...he\u0027d forced himself on her. Forced her until...until he hadn\u0027t had to force her any longer. Until it had felt right to want him. Until wanting him had been all there was.\n Just like the dream. But this wasn\u0027t a dream, Sarah told herself, straightening her shoulders. It was more than real, and now he was walking away from her as if it hadn\u0027t mattered to him in the least. Pride was every bit as dangerous an emotion as anger.\n \"Mr. Redman.\"\n When he turned, he saw her standing there with the rifle. If the look in her eyes meant anything, she\u0027d have dearly loved to use it.\n \"Apparently you take chances, too.\" She tilted her head. There was challenge in the gesture, as well as a touch of fury and a stab of hurt. \"This rifle\u0027s still loaded.\"\n \"That\u0027s right.\" He touched the brim of his hat in a salute. \"It\u0027s a hell of a lot harder to pull the trigger when you\u0027re aiming at flesh and blood, but go ahead. It\u0027d be hard to miss at this range.\"\n She wished she could. She wished she had the skill to put a bullet between his feet and watch him jump. Lifting her chin, she walked toward the house. \"The difference between you and me, Mr. Redman, is that I still have morals.\"\n \"There\u0027s some truth in that.\" He strode easily beside her. \"Seeing as you fixed me breakfast and all, why don\u0027t you call me Jake?\" He swung up into the saddle as a buggy rumbled into the yard.\n \"Sarah?\" With her hands still on the reins, Liza cast an uncertain glance at her new friend, then at the man in the saddle. She knew she wasn\u0027t supposed to approve of men like Jake Redman. But she found it difficult not to when he looked so attractive and exciting.\n \"I hope you don\u0027t mind us coming out.\" A young boy jumped out of the buggy and began to chase the puppy, who was running in circles.\n \"Not at all. I\u0027m delighted.\" Sarah shaded her eyes with her hand so that she could see Jake clearly. \"Mr. Redman was just on his way.\"\n \"Those sure are some pretty guns you got there, mister.\" Young John Cody put a hand on the neck of Jake\u0027s gray mustang and peered up at the smooth wooden grip of one of the Colt.45s he carried. He knew who Jake Redman was-he\u0027d heard all the stories but he\u0027d never managed to get this close before.\n \"Think so?\" Ignoring the two women, Jake shifted in his saddle to get a better look at the boy. No more than ten, he figured, with awe in his eyes and a smudge of dirt on his cheek.\n \"Yessiree. I think that when you slap leather you\u0027re just about the fastest there is, maybe in the whole world.\"\n \"John Cody.\" Liza stayed in the buggy, wringing her hands. \"You oughtn\u0027t to bother Mr. Redman.\"\n Jake shot her a quick, amused look. Did she think he\u0027d shoot the kid for talking to him? \"No bother, ma\u0027am.\" He glanced down at Johnny again. \"You can\u0027t believe everything you hear.\"\n But Johnny figured he knew what was what. \"My ma says that since you saved that stage there\u0027s probably some good in you somewhere.\"\n This time Liza called her brother\u0027s name in a strained, desperate whisper. Jake had to grin. He shifted his attention to Sarah long enough to see that she was standing as stiff as a rod, with one eyebrow arched.\n \"That\u0027s right kind of her. I\u0027ll tell the sheriff about your trouble...Miss Conway. I reckon he\u0027ll be out to see you.\"\n \"Thank you, Mr. Redman. Good day.\"\n He tipped his hat to her, then to Liza. \"See you around, Johnny.\" He turned his horse in a half circle and rode away.\n \"Yessir,\" Johnny shouted after him. \"Yessiree.\"\n \"John Cody.\" Liza collected herself enough to climb out of the buggy. Johnny just grinned and raced off after the puppy again, firing an imaginary Peacemaker. \"That\u0027s my brother.\"\n \"Yes, I imagined it was.\"\n Liza gave Johnny one last look of sisterly disgust before going to Sarah. \"Ma\u0027s tending the store today. She wanted you to have this. It\u0027s a loaf of her cinnamon bread.\"\n \"Oh, how kind of her.\" One whiff brought memories of home. \"Can you stay?\"\n Liza gave Sarah the bread and a quick, dimpled smile. \"I was hoping I could.\"\n \"Come in, please. I\u0027ll fix us some tea.\"\n While Sarah busied herself at the stove, Liza looked around the tiny cabin. It was scrubbed clean as a whistle. \"It\u0027s not as bad as I thought it would be.\" Instantly she lifted a hand to her mouth. \"I\u0027m sorry. Ma always says I talk too much for my own good.\"\n \"That\u0027s all right.\" Sarah got out two tin cups and tried not to wish they were china. \"I was taken by surprise myself.\"\n At ease again, Liza sat at the table. \"I didn\u0027t expect to run into Jake Redman out here.\"\n Sarah brought the knife down into the bread with a thwack. \"Neither did I.\"\n \"He said you had trouble.\"\n Unconsciously Sarah lifted a finger to her lips. They were still warm from his, and they tingled as her arms had from the kick of the Henry. She had trouble, all right. Since she couldn\u0027t explain the kiss to herself, she could hardly explain it to Liza. \"Someone set fire to my shed last night.\"\n \"Oh, Sarah, no! Who? Why?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" She brought the two cups to the table. \"Fortunately, Mr. Redman happened to be riding by this way.\"\n \"Do you think he might have done it?\"\n Sarah\u0027s brow rose as she considered the possibility. She remembered the way he\u0027d bathed her face and tended her hurts. \"No, I\u0027m quite certain he didn\u0027t. I believe Mr. Redman takes a more direct approach.\" \"I guess you\u0027re right about that. I can\u0027t say he\u0027s started any trouble here in Lone Bluff, but he\u0027s finished some.\"\n \"What do you know about him?\"\n \"I don\u0027t think anyone knows much. He rode into town about six months ago. Of course, everybody\u0027s heard of Jake Redman. Some say he\u0027s killed more than twenty men in gunfights.\"\n \"Killed?\" Stunned, Sarah could only stare. \"But why?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know if there always is a why. I did hear that some rancher up north hired him on. There\u0027d been trouble... rustling, barn-burning.\"\n \"Hired him on,\" Sarah murmured. \"To kill.\"\n \"That\u0027s what it comes down to, I suppose. I do know that plenty of people were nervous when he rode in and took a room at Maggie O\u0027Rourke\u0027s.\" Liza broke off a corner of the slice of bread Sarah had served her. \"But he didn\u0027t seem to be looking for trouble. About two weeks later he found it, anyway.\" A hired killer, Sarah thought, her stomach churning.\n And she\u0027d kissed him, kissed him in a way no lady kissed a man who wasn\u0027t her husband. \"What happened?\" \"Jim Carlson was in the Bird Cage. That\u0027s one of the saloons in town.\"\n \"Carlson?\"\n \"Yes, he\u0027s Samuel Carlson\u0027s brother. You wouldn\u0027t know it,\" Liza continued, pursing her lips. \"Jim\u0027s nothing like Samuel. Full of spit, that one. Likes to brag and swagger and bully. Cheats at cards, but nobody had the nerve to call him on it. Until Jake.\" Liza drank more tea and listened with half an ear to her brother\u0027s war whoops in the yard. \"The way I heard it, there were some words over the card table. Jim was drunk and a little careless with his dealing. Once Jake called him on it, some of the other men joined in. Word is, Jim drew. Everybody figured Jake would put a bullet in him there and then, but he just knocked him down.\"\n \"He didn\u0027t shoot him?\" She felt a wave of relief.\n Perhaps he wasn\u0027t what people said he was.\n \"No. At least, the way I heard it, Jake just knocked him silly and gave Jim\u0027s gun to the bartender. Somebody had already hightailed it for the sheriff. By the time he got there, Jake was standing at the bar having himself a drink and Jim was picking himself up off the floor. I think Barker was going to put Jim in a cell for the night until he sobered up. But when he took hold of him, Jim pulled the gun from the sheriffs holster. Instead of getting a bullet in the back, Jake put one in Jim Carlson, then turned around and finished his drink.\"\n Dead\u0027s dead. \"Did he kill him?\"\n \"No, though there\u0027s some in town wished he had. The Carlsons are pretty powerful around here, but there were enough witnesses, the sheriff included, to call it self-defense.\"\n \"I see.\" But she didn\u0027t understand the kind of justice that had to be meted out with guns and bullets.\n \"I\u0027m surprised Jake-Mr. Redman-hasn\u0027t moved on.\"\n \"He must like it around here. What about you?\n Doesn\u0027t it scare you to stay out here alone?\"\n Sarah thought of her first night shivering under the blanket and praying for morning. \"A little.\"\n \"After living back east.\" Liza gave a sigh. To her, Philadelphia sounded as glamorous and foreign as Paris or London. \"All the places you\u0027ve seen, the pretty clothes you must have worn.\"\n Sarah struggled with a quick pang of homesickness.\n \"Have you ever been east?\"\n \"No, but I\u0027ve seen pictures.\" Liza eyed Sarah\u0027s trunks with longing. \"The women wear beautiful clothes.\"\n \"Would you like to see some of mine?\"\n Liza\u0027s face lit up. \"I\u0027d love to.\"\n For the next twenty minutes Liza oohed and aahed over ruffles and lace. Her reaction caused Sarah to appreciate what she had always taken for granted. Crouched on the cabin floor, they discussed important matters such as ribbons and sashes and the proper tilt of a bonnet while Johnny was kept occupied with a hunk of bread and the puppy.\n \"Oh, look at this one.\" Delighted, Liza rose, sweeping a dress in front of her. \"I wish you had a looking glass.\"\n It was the white muslin with the rosebuds on the skirt. The dress she\u0027d planned to wear for her first dinner with her father. He\u0027d never see it now. She glanced at the trunks. Or any of the other lovely things he\u0027d made certain she had in her life.\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" With the dress still crushed against her, Liza stepped forward. \"You look so sad.\"\n \"I was thinking of my father, of how hard he worked for me.\"\n Liza\u0027s fascination with the clothes was immediately outweighed by her sympathy. \"He loved you. Often when he came in the store he\u0027d talk about you, about what you\u0027d written in one of your letters. I remember how he brought in this picture of you, a drawing in a little frame. He wanted everyone to see how pretty you were. He was so proud of you, Sarah.\"\n \"I miss him.\" With a shake of her head, Sarah blinked back tears. \"It\u0027s strange, all those years we were separated. Sometimes I could barely remember him. But since I\u0027ve been here I seem to know him better, and miss him more.\"\n Gently Liza laid a hand on her shoulder. \"My pa sure riles me sometimes, but I guess I\u0027d about die if anything happened to him.\"\n \"Well, at least I have this.\" She looked around the small cabin. \"I feel closer to him here. I like to think about him sitting at that table and writing to me.\" After a long breath she managed to smile. \"I\u0027m glad I came.\"\n Liza held out a hand. \"So am I.\"\n Rising, Sarah fluffed out the sleeves of the dress Liza was holding. \"Now, let me be your looking glass. You\u0027re taller and curvier than I...\" With her lips pursed, she walked in a circle around Liza. \"The neckline would flatter you, but I think I\u0027d do away with some of the ruffles in the bodice. A nice pink would be your color. It would show off your hair and eyes.\" \"Can you imagine me wearing a dress like that?\" Closing her eyes, Liza turned in slow circles. \"It would have to be at a dance. I\u0027d have my hair curled over my shoulder and wear a velvet ribbon around my throat. Will Metcalf\u0027s eyes would fall right out.\" \"Who\u0027s Will Metcalf?\"\n Liza opened her eyes and giggled. \"Just a man.\n He\u0027s a deputy in town. He\u0027d like to be my beau.\" Mischief flashed across her face. \"I might decide to let him.\"\n \"Liza loves Will,\" Johnny sang through the window. \"You hush up, John Cody.\" Rushing to the window, Liza leaned out. \"If you don\u0027t, I\u0027ll tell Ma who broke Grandma\u0027s china plate.\"\n \"Liza loves Will,\" he repeated, unconcerned, then raced off with the puppy.\n \"Nothing more irritating than little brothers,\" she muttered. With a sigh of regret, she replaced the dress in the trunk.\n Tapping a finger on her lips, Sarah came to a quick decision. She should have thought of it before, she reflected. Or perhaps it had been milling around in her mind all along. \"Liza, would you like a dress like that...in pink, like that pretty muslin I saw in your store yesterday?\"\n \"I guess I\u0027d think I\u0027d gone to heaven.\"\n \"What if I made it for you?\"\n \"Made it for me?\" Wide-eyed, Liza looked at the trunk, then back at Sarah. \"Could you?\"\n \"I\u0027m very handy with a needle.\" Caught up in the idea, Sarah pushed through her trunks to find her measuring tape. \"If you can get the material, I\u0027ll make the dress. If you like it, you can tell the other women who come in your store.\"\n \"Of course.\" Obediently Liza lifted her arms so that Sarah could measure her. \"I\u0027ll tell everyone.\" \"Then some of those women might want new dresses, fashionable new dresses.\" Looking up, she caught the gleam of understanding in Liza\u0027s eyes. \"You bet they would.\"\n \"You get me that material and I\u0027ll make you a dress that will have Will Metcalf standing on his head.\"\n Two hours later Sarah was pouring water over her vegetable garden. In the heat of the afternoon, with her back smarting from the chores and sun baking the dirt almost as fast as she could dampen it, she wondered if it was worth it. A garden out here would require little less than a miracle. And she would much prefer flowers.\n You couldn\u0027t eat flowers, she reminded herself, and poured the last of the water out. Now she would have to walk back to the stream and fill the pail again to have water for cooking and washing.\n A bath, she thought as she wiped the back of her hand over her brow. What she wouldn\u0027t give for a long bath in a real tub.\n She heard the horses. It pleased her to realize that she was becoming accustomed to the sound-or lack of sound-that surrounded her new home. With her hand shading her eyes, she watched two riders come into view. It wasn\u0027t until she recognized one as Lucius that she realized she\u0027d been holding her breath. \"Lafitte!\" she called, but the dog continued to race around the yard, barking.\n \"Miss Conway.\" Sheriff Barker tipped his hat and chuckled at the snarling pup. \"Got yourself a fierce-looking guard dog there.\"\n \"Makes a ruckus, anyhow,\" Lucius said, swinging down from his horse. Lafitte sprang at him, gripping the bottom of his pant leg with sharp puppy teeth. Bending, Lucius snatched him up by the cuff of the neck. \"You mind your manners, young fella.\" The second he was on the ground again, Lafitte ran to hide behind Sarah\u0027s skirts.\n \"Heard you had some trouble out here.\" Barker nodded toward the remains of the shed. \"This happen last night?\"\n \"That\u0027s right. If you\u0027d like to come inside, I was just about to get some water. I\u0027m sure you\u0027d like some coffee after your ride.\"\n \"I\u0027ll fetch you some water, miss,\" Lucius said, taking the pail from her. \"Hey, boy.\" He grinned down at the pup. \"Why don\u0027t you come along with me? I\u0027ll keep you out of trouble.\" After a moment\u0027s hesitation, Lafitte trotted along after him.\n \"Are you thinking about hiring him on?\"\n With her lip caught between her teeth, Sarah watched Lucius stroll off. \"I was considering it.\" \"You\u0027d be smart to do it.\" Barker took out a bandanna and wiped his neck. \"Lucius has a powerful affection for the bottle, but it doesn\u0027t seem to bother him. He\u0027s honest. Did some soldiering a while back. He\u0027s amiable enough, drunk or sober.\"\n Sarah managed a smile. \"I\u0027ll take that as a recommendation, Sheriff Barker.\"\n \"Well, now.\" The sheriff looked back at the shed.\n \"Why don\u0027t you tell me what happened here?\"\n As clearly as she could, Sarah told him everything she knew. He listened, grunting and nodding occasionally. Everything she said jibed with the story Jake had given him. But she didn\u0027t add, because she didn\u0027t know, that Jake had followed the trail of two riders into the rocks, where he\u0027d discovered the ashes of a campfire.\n \"Any reason you can think of why somebody\u0027d want to do this?\"\n \"None at all. There\u0027s nothing here that could mean anything to anyone other than myself. Did my father have any enemies?\" Barker spit tobacco juice in the dirt. \"I wouldn\u0027t think so right off. I got to tell you, Miss Conway, there ain\u0027t much I can do. I\u0027ll ask some questions and poke around some. Could be some drifters passed through and wanted to raise some hell. Begging your pardon.\" But he didn\u0027t think so. \"I\u0027d wondered the same myself.\"\n \"You\u0027ll feel safer having old Lucius around.\"\n She glanced over to see him coming back with the pail and the puppy. \"I suppose you\u0027re right.\" But he didn\u0027t look like her idea of a protector. It was unfortunate for her that her idea of one had taken the form of Jake Redman. \"I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll do nicely,\" she said with more confidence than she felt.\n \"I\u0027ll ride out now and again and see how you\u0027re getting on.\" Barker pulled himself onto his horse. \"You know, Miss Conway, Matt tried to grow something in that patch of dirt for as long as I can recollect.\" He spit again. \"Never had any luck.\"\n \"Perhaps I\u0027ll have better. Good afternoon, Sheriff.\" \"Good day, ma\u0027am.\" He lifted a hand to Lucius as he turned for home. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lawless/page-5.html","bookId":2686,"book":{"id":2686,"title":"Lawless","description":"Storyline: \n Lawless (Love by Design: Jack\u0027s Stories 0.5) \n Filled with Nora\u0027s exquisite storytelling and memorable characters, this rare Western historical romance is a unique treat for Nora\u0027s many fans.
