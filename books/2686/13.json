{"id":70024,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"\"I\u0027m feeling lots better, Miss Conway.\" Alice took the tin cup and sipped gingerly.\n She didn\u0027t want to complain about her back, or about the pain that still galloped along it despite the cooling salve. The morning light showed her facial bruises in heart-wrenching detail and caused the girl to look even younger and smaller and more vulnerable. Though the scratches on her cheeks were no longer red and angry, Sarah judged it would be several days before they faded.\n \"You look better.\" It wasn\u0027t strictly true, and Sarah vowed to keep her patient away from a mirror a bit longer. Though the swelling had eased considerably, she was still worried about Alice\u0027s eye and had already decided to drive into town later and talk with the doctor. \"Try a little of this soft-boiled egg. You need your strength.\"\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" Privately Alice thought the glossy wet yolk looked more like a slimy eye than food. But if Sarah had told her to eat a fried scorpion she\u0027d have opened her mouth and swallowed. \"Miss Conway?\"\n \"Yes, Alice?\" Sarah spooned up more egg.\n \"I\u0027m beholden to you for taking me in like you did, and I can\u0027t-Miss Conway, you gave me your own bed last night. It ain\u0027t fitting.\"\n Smiling a little, Sarah set the plate aside. \"Alice, I assure you, I was quite comfortable last night.\"\n \"But, Miss Conway-\"\n \"Alice, if you keep this up I\u0027m going to think you\u0027re ungrateful.\"\n \"Oh!\" Something close to horror flashed in Alice\u0027s eyes. \"No, ma\u0027am.\"\n \"Well, then.\" Because the response was exactly what she\u0027d expected, Sarah rose. She remembered that the nuns had nursed with compassion tempered with brisk practicality. \"You can show your gratitude by being a good patient and getting some more rest. If you\u0027re feeling up to it later, I\u0027ll have Lucius bring you down and we can sit and talk a while.\"\n \"I\u0027d like that. Miss Conway, if it hadn\u0027t been for you and Eli, I think I\u0027d\u0027ve died. I was hoping... Well, I got some money saved. It ain\u0027t much, but I\u0027d like you to have it for all your trouble.\"\n \"I don\u0027t want your money, Alice.\"\n The girl flushed and looked away. \"I know you\u0027re probably thinking about where it comes from, but-\" \"No.\" She took Alice\u0027s hand firmly in hers. \"That has nothing to do with it.\" Pride, Sarah thought. She had plenty of her own. Alice was entitled to hers. \"Alice, did Eli want money for driving you out of town?\" \"No, but...he\u0027s a friend.\"\n \"I\u0027d like to be your friend, if you\u0027d let me. You rest now, and we\u0027ll talk about all this later.\" She gave Alice\u0027s hand a reassuring squeeze before she picked up the empty dishes and started down the ladder. She barely muffled a squeal when hands closed around her waist.\n \"Told you you didn\u0027t need that corset.\"\n Sarah sent Jake what she hoped was an indignant look over her shoulder. \"Is that why I couldn\u0027t find it when I dressed this morning?\"\n \"Just doing you a favor.\" Before she could decide whether to laugh or lecture, he was whirling her around and kissing her.\n \"Jake, Alice is-\"\n \"Not likely to faint if she figures out what I\u0027m doing.\" But he set her aside, because he liked the way the sunlight streamed through the curtains and onto her hair. \"You\u0027re mighty nice to look at, Duchess.\" It was foolish to blush, but her color rose. \"Why don\u0027t you sit down, and you can look at me some more while I fix you breakfast?\"\n \"I\u0027d like to, but I\u0027ve got some things to see to.\" He touched her again, just a fingertip to the single wispy curl that had escaped from the neat bun on top of her head. \"Sarah, will you let me have Matt\u0027s journal?\" Both the grief and the dread showed clearly in her eyes before she lowered them. During the night, after love and before sleep, she had thought of little else but what Jake had told her. Part of her wondered if she would be better off not knowing, not being sure.\n But another part, the same part that had kept her from turning back and going east again, had already accepted what needed to be done.\n \"Yes.\" She walked to the hearth to work the rock loose. \"I found this the first night. His journal, what must have been his savings, and the deed to Sarah\u0027s Pride.\"\n When she held the book out to him, Jake resisted the urge to open it there and then. If he found what he thought he would find, he would have business to take care of before he said anything else to her. \"I\u0027ll take it along with me, if it\u0027s all the same to you.\" She opened her mouth to object, wanting the matter settled once and for all. But he\u0027d asked for her trust. Perhaps this was the way to show him he had it. \"All right.\"\n \"And the deed? Will you let me hold on to it until we have some answers?\"\n In answer, she offered it to him, without hesitation, without question. For a moment they held the deed, and the dream, between them. \"Just like that?\" he murmured.\n \"Yes.\" She smiled and released her hold. \"Just like that.\"\n That her trust was so easily given, so total in her eyes, left him groping for words. \"Sarah, I want...\" What? he wondered as he stared down at her. To guard and protect, to love and possess? She was like something cool and sweet that had poured into him and washed away years of bitter thirst. But he didn\u0027t have the words, he thought. And he didn\u0027t have the right. \"I\u0027ll take care of this.\"\n She lifted a brow. There had been something else, something in his eyes. She wanted it back, so that she could see it, understand it. \"I thought we were going to take care of it.\"\n \"No.\" He cupped her chin in his hand. \"You\u0027re going to leave this to me. I don\u0027t want anything to happen to you.\"\n Her brow was still lifted as her lips curved.\n \"Why?\"\n \"Because I don\u0027t. I want you to-\" Whatever he might have said was postponed. He moved to the window quickly. \"You\u0027ve got company coming.\" As he spotted the buggy, his shoulders relaxed. \"Looks like Mrs. Cody and her girl.\"\n \"Oh.\" Sarah\u0027s hands shot up automatically to straighten her hair. \"I must look-Oh, how would I know? I haven\u0027t had a chance to so much as glance in the mirror.\"\n \"Wouldn\u0027t matter much.\" Without glancing back, he pulled open the door. \"Too bad you\u0027re so homely.\" Muttering, she pulled off her apron and followed him outside. Then memory came flooding back and had her biting her Up. \"I imagine they would have heard all about the, ah, incident yesterday.\"\n \"I expect.\" Jake secured the deed and the journal in the saddlebags that he\u0027d tossed over the rail. \"You needn\u0027t look so amused.\" She fiddled nervously with the cameo at her throat, then put on her brightest smile. \"Good morning, Mrs. Cody. Liza.\" \"Good morning, Sarah.\" Anne Cody brought the horses to a stop. \"I hope you don\u0027t mind an early call.\"\n \"Not at all.\" But her fingers were busy pleating her skirt. She was afraid there was a lecture coming. The good sisters had given Sarah more than what she considered her share over the past twelve years. \"I\u0027m always delighted to see you,\" she added. \"Both of you.\"\n Anne glanced over at the dog, who\u0027d run out to bark at the horses. \"My, he\u0027s grown some, hasn\u0027t he?\" She held out a hand. \"Mr. Redman?\"\n Jake stepped over to help her, then Liza, down, remaining silent until he\u0027d slung his saddlebags over his shoulder. \"I\u0027d best be on my way.\" He touched a hand to his hat. \"Ladies.\"\n \"Mr. Redman.\" Anne held up a hand in the gesture she used to stop her children from rushing out before their chores were finished. \"Might I have a word with you?\"\n He shifted his bags until their weight fell evenly.\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\"\n \"My son John has been dogging your heels these last weeks. I\u0027m surprised you put up with it.\"\n Jake didn\u0027t imagine it pleased her, either, to have the boy spending time with him. \"He hasn\u0027t made a pest of himself.\"\n Curious, Anne studied his face.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s a kind thing to say, Mr. Redman, when I\u0027m sure he\u0027s done just that.\"\n \"Johnny was born a pest,\" Liza put in, earning a slow, measured look from her mother.\n \"It appears my children have that in common.\"\n With Liza effectively silenced, Anne turned back to Jake. \"He\u0027s been going through what most boys his age go through, I expect. Fascinated with guns, gun fights. Gunfighters. I don\u0027t mind saying it\u0027s given me some worry.\"\n \"I\u0027ll keep my distance,\" Jake said, and turned to leave.\n \"Mr. Redman.\" Anne hadn\u0027t raised two willful children without knowing how to add the right tone of authority to her voice. \"I\u0027ll have my say.\"\n \"Ma.\" Both Liza\u0027s cheeks and voice paled when she saw the look in Jake\u0027s eyes. Cold, she thought, and moistened her lips. She\u0027d never seen eyes so cold. \"Maybe we should let Mr. Redman be on his way.\" \"Your mother\u0027s got something to say,\" Jake said quietly. \"I reckon she ought to say it.\"\n \"Thank you.\" Pleased, Anne drew off her riding gloves. \"Johnny was real excited about what happened here between you and Burt Donley.\"\n \"Mrs. Cody,\" Sarah began, only to be silenced by a look from both her and Jake.\n \"As I was saying,\" Anne continued, \"Johnny hardly talked about anything else for days. He figured having a shoot-out made a man a man and gave him something to strut about. Even started pestering his pa for a Peacemaker.\" She glanced down at the guns on Jake\u0027s hips. \"Wooden grip, he said. Nothing fancy, like some of the glory boys wear. Just a good solid Colt. Mr. Cody and I had just about run clean out of patience with the boy. Then, just yesterday, he came home and told me something.\" She paused, measuring her words. \"He said that killing somebody in a gunfight or any other way doesn\u0027t make a man grownup or important. He said that a smart man doesn\u0027t look for trouble. He walks away from it when he can, and faces it when he can\u0027t.\"\n For the first time, Anne smiled. \"I guess I\u0027d been telling him pretty near the same, but it didn\u0027t get through coming from me or his pa. Made me wonder who got him thinking that way.\" She offered her hand again. \"I wanted to tell you I\u0027m obliged.\"\n Jake stared at the hand before taking it. It was the kind of gesture, one of gratitude, even friendship, that had rarely been made to him. \"He\u0027s a smart boy, Mrs. Cody. He\u0027d have come around to it.\"\n \"Sooner or later.\" Anne stepped toward the door of the house and then she turned back. \"Maggie O\u0027Rourke thinks a lot of you. I guess I found out why. I won\u0027t keep you any longer, Mr. Redman.\"\n Not quite sure how to respond, he touched his hat before he started toward the paddock to saddle his horse.\n \"That\u0027s quite a man, Sarah,\" Anne commented. \"If I were you, I\u0027d want to go say a proper goodbye.\" \"Yes, I...\" She looked at Anne, then back toward Jake, torn between manners and longings.\n \"You won\u0027t mind if I fix tea, will you?\" Anne asked as she disappeared inside.\n \"No, please, make yourself at home.\" Sarah looked toward Jake again. \"I\u0027ll only be a minute.\" Gathering her skirts, she ran. \"Jake!\" He turned, the saddle held in both hands, and enjoyed the flash of legs and petticoats. \"Wait. I-\" She stopped, a hand on her heart, when she realized she was not only out of breath but hadn\u0027t any idea what she wanted to say to him. \"Are you... When will you be back?\"\n The mustang shifted and nickered softly as Jake settled the saddle in place. \"Haven\u0027t left yet.\"\n She hated feeling foolish, and hated even more the idea that he could swing onto his horse and ride out of her life for days at a time. Perhaps patience would do the job.\n \"I was hoping you\u0027d come back for supper.\"\n He tossed up a stirrup to tighten the cinch. \"You asking me to supper?\"\n \"Unless you\u0027ve something else you\u0027d rather be doing.\" His hand snaked out, fast and smooth, to snag her arm before she could flounce away. \"It\u0027s not often I get invitations to supper from pretty ladies.\" His grip firm, he glanced back toward the house. Things were changing, he decided, and changing fast, when he looked at the adobe cabin and thought of home. He still didn\u0027t know what the hell to do about it. \"If I\u0027d known you\u0027d need so long to think about it,\" Sarah said between her teeth, \"I wouldn\u0027t have bothered. You can just-\" But before she could tell him he swept her off her feet.\n \"You sure do get fired up easy.\" He brought his mouth down hard on hers to taste the heat and the honey. \"That\u0027s one of the things I like about you.\" \"Put me down.\" But her arms encircled his neck. \"Mrs. Cody might see.\" Then she laughed and kissed him again as he swung her down. \"Well, will you come to supper or not?\"\n He vaulted into the saddle in one fluid, economical motion. His eyes were shadowed by the brim of his hat when he looked down at her. \"Yeah, I\u0027ll come to supper.\"\n \"It\u0027ll be ready at seven,\" she called after him as he spurred his horse into a gallop. She watched until dust and distance obscured him. Gathering her skirts again, she ran back to the house. The laughter that was bubbling in her throat dried up when she heard Alice\u0027s weeping.\n Liza stood by the stove, the kettle steaming in her hand. \"Sarah, Ma\u0027s...\" But Sarah was already rushing up the ladder, ready to defend the girl.\n Anne Cody held the weeping Alice in her arms, rocking her gently. One wide, capable hand was stroking the girl\u0027s dark hair.\n \"There now, honey, you cry it all out,\" she murmured.\n \"Then it\u0027ll be behind you.\" Wanting quiet, she sent Sarah a warning glance. Her own eyes were damp. Slowly Sarah descended the ladder.\n \"Alice called for you,\" Liza explained, still holding the kettle. \"Ma went up to see what she needed.\" Liza set the sputtering kettle aside. Tea was the last thing on her mind. \"Sarah, what\u0027s going on?\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure I know.\"\n Liza cast another look toward the loft and said in a low voice. \"Was she...that girl...really beaten?\" \"Yes.\" The memory of it had Sarah touching a fingertip to the bruise under her own eye. \"Horribly. Liza, I\u0027ve never known one person was capable of hurting another so viciously.\" She needed to be busy, Sarah decided. There was too much to think about.\n Her father, the mine, Jake, Alice. After running a distracted hand over her hair, she began to slice honey cake.\n \"Did she really work for Carlotta?\"\n \"Yes. Liza, she\u0027s just a girl, younger than you and I.\"\n \"Really?\" Torn between sympathy and fascination, Liza edged closer to Sarah. \"But she... Well, I mean, at the Silver Star she must have...\"\n \"She didn\u0027t know anything else.\" Sarah looked down at her hands. Honey cake and tea. There had been a time when she had thought life was as ordered and simple as that \"Her father sold her. Sold her to a man for twenty dollars.\"\n \"But that\u0027s-\" The curiosity in Liza\u0027s eyes heated to fury. \"Why, he\u0027s the one who should be beat. Her own pa. Somebody ought to-\" \"Hush, Liza.\" Anne slipped quietly down the ladder. \"No one deserves to be beat.\"\n \"Ma. Sarah says that girl\u0027s pa sold her. Sold her off for money, like a horse.\"\n Anne paused in the act of brushing down her skirts.\n \"Is that true, Sarah?\"\n \"Yes. She ran away and ended up at the Silver Star.\"\n Anne\u0027s lips tightened as she fought back words that even her husband had never heard her utter. \"I\u0027d dearly love that tea now.\"\n \"Oh, yes.\" Sarah hurried back to the stove. \"I\u0027m sorry. Please sit down.\" She set out the napkins she\u0027d made out of blue checked gingham. \"I hope you\u0027ll enjoy this honey cake. It\u0027s a recipe from the cook of a very dear friend of mine in Philadelphia.\" As she offered the plate, Philadelphia and everyone in it seemed years away.\n \"Thank you, dear.\" Anne waited for Sarah to sit down, then said, \"Alice is sleeping now. I wasn\u0027t sure you\u0027d done the right thing by taking her in here. Truth is, I drove out this morning because I was concerned.\" \"I had to take her in.\"\n \"No, you didn\u0027t.\" When Sarah bristled, Anne laid a hand on hers. \"But you did what was right, and I\u0027m proud of you. That girl needs help.\" With a sigh, she sat back and looked at her own daughter. Pretty Liza, she thought, always so bright and curious. And safe, she reflected, adding a quick prayer of thanksgiving. Her children had always had a full plate and a solid roof over their heads-and a father who loved them. She made up her mind to thank her husband very soon.\n \"Alice Johnson has had nothing but hard times.\" Anne took a sip of tea. Her mind was made up. She had only to convince her husband. At that thought her lips curved a little. It was never hard to convince a man whose heart was soft and open. The other ladies in town would be a bit more difficult, but she\u0027d bring them around. The challenge of it made her smile widen and the light of battle glint in her eyes. \"What that girl needs is some proper work and a real home. When she\u0027s on her feet again, I think she should come work at the store.\"\n \"Oh, Mrs. Cody.\"\n Anne brushed Sarah\u0027s stunned gratitude aside.\n \"Once Liza\u0027s married to Will I\u0027m going to need new help. She can take Liza\u0027s room in the house, as well...as part of her wage.\"\n Sarah fumbled for words, then gave up and simply leaned over to wrap her arms around Anne, \"It\u0027s kind of you,\" she managed. \"So kind. I\u0027ve spoken with Alice about just that, but she pointed out that the women in town wouldn\u0027t accept her after she\u0027d worked at the Silver Star.\"\n \"You don\u0027t know Ma.\" Pride shimmered in Liza\u0027s voice. \"She\u0027ll bring the ladies around, every one.\n Won\u0027t you, Ma?\"\n Anne patted her hah-. \"You can put money on it.\"\n Satisfied, she broke off a corner of the honey cake. \"Sarah, now that we\u0027ve got that settled, I feel I have to talk to you about the...visit you paid to the Silver Star yesterday.\"\n \"Visit?\" Though she knew it was hopeless, Sarah covered the bruise under her eyes with her fingers. \"You know, when you tangled with Carlotta,\" Liza put in. \"Everyone in town\u0027s talking about how you wrestled with her and even punched Jake Redman. I wish I\u0027d seen it.\" She caught her mother\u0027s eye and grimaced. \"Well, I do.\"\n \"Oh, Lord.\" This time Sarah covered her entire face. \"Everyone?\"\n \"Mrs. Miller was standing just outside when the sheriff went in.\" Liza took a healthy bite of cake. \"You know how she loves to carry tales.\"\n When Sarah just groaned, Anne shook her head at Liza. \"Honey, you eat some more of that cake and keep your mouth busy. Now, Sarah.\" Anne pried Sarah\u0027s hands away from her face. \"I have to say I was a mite surprised to hear that you\u0027d gone in that place and had a hair-pulling match with that woman.\n Truth is, a nice young girl like you shouldn\u0027t even know about places and people like that.\"\n \"Can\u0027t live in Lone Bluff two days and not know about Carlotta,\" Liza said past a mouthful of cake.\n \"Even Johnny-\"\n \"Liza.\" Anne held up a single finger. \"Chew. Seeing as you\u0027re without kin of your own, Sarah, I figured I\u0027d come on out and speak to you about it.\" She took another sip of tea while Sarah waited to be lectured. \"Well, blast it, now that I\u0027ve seen that girl up there, I wished I\u0027d taken a good yank at Carlotta, myself.\" \"Ma!\" Delighted, Liza slapped both hands to her mouth. \"You wouldn\u0027t.\"\n \"No.\" Anne flushed a little and shifted in her chair. \"But I\u0027d like to. Now, I\u0027m not saying I want to hear about you going back there, Sarah.\"\n \"No.\" Sarah managed a rueful smile. \"I think I\u0027ve finished any business I might have at the Silver Star.\" \"Popped you a good one, did she?\" Anne commented studying Sarah\u0027s eye.\n \"Yes.\" Sarah grinned irrepressibly. \"But I gave her a bloody nose. It\u0027s quite possible that I broke it.\" \"Really. Oh, I do wish I\u0027d seen that.\" Ready to be impressed, Liza leaned forward, only to straighten again at a look from Anne. \"Well, it\u0027s not as if I\u0027d go inside myself.\"\n \"Not if you want to keep the hide on your bottom,\" Anne said calmly. She smoothed her hair, took another sip of tea, then gave up. \"Well, darn it, are you going to tell us what it looks like in there or not?\" With a laugh, Sarah propped her elbows on the table and told them.\n Scheming came naturally to Carlotta. As she lay in the wide feather bed, she ran through all the wrongs that had been done to her and her plans for making them right. The light was dim, with only two thin cracks appearing past the sides of the drawn shades. It was a large room by the Silver Star\u0027s standards. She\u0027d had the walls between two smaller rooms removed to fashion her own private quarters, sacrificing the money one extra girl would have made her for comfort.\n For Carlotta, money and comfort were one and the same. She wanted plenty of both.\n Though it was barely nine, she poured a glass of whiskey from the bottle that was always at her bedside. The hot, powerful taste filled the craving she awoke with every morning. Sipping and thinking, she cast her eyes around the room.\n The walls were papered in a somewhat virulent red-and-silver stripe she found rich and elegant. Thick red drapes, too heavy for the blistering Arizona summers, hung at the windows. They made her think, smugly, of queens and palaces. The carpet echoed the color and was badly in need of cleaning. She rarely noticed the dirt.\n On the mirrored vanity, which was decorated with painted cherubs, was a silver brush set with an elaborate C worked into the design. It was the only monogram she used. Carlotta had no last name, at least none she cared to remember.\n Her mother had always had a man in her bed. Carlotta had gone to sleep most nights on a straw pallet in the corner, her lullaby the grunts and groans of sex.\n It had made her sick, the way men had pounded themselves into her mother. But that had been nothing compared to the disgust she had felt for her mother\u0027s weeping when the men were gone.\n Crying and sniveling and begging God\u0027s forgiveness, Carlotta thought. Her mother had been the whore of that frigid little town in the Carolina mountains, but she hadn\u0027t had the guts to make it work for her.\n Always claimed she was doing it to feed her little girl, Carlotta remembered with a sneer. She poured more whiskey into the glass. If that had been so, why had her little girl gone hungry so many nights? In the dim light, Carlotta studied the deep amber liquid. Because Ma was just as fond of whiskey as I am, she decided. She drank, and savored the taste.\n The difference between you and me, Ma, she thought to herself, is that I ain\u0027t ashamed-not of the whiskey, not of the men. And I made something of myself.\n Did you cry when I left? Carlotta laughed as she thought back to the night she\u0027d left the smelly, windowless shack for the last time. She\u0027d been fifteen and she\u0027d saved nearly thirty dollars she\u0027d made selling herself to trappers. Men paid more for youth. Carlotta had learned quickly. Her mother had never known her daughter was her stiffest competition.\n She despised them all. Every man who\u0027d pushed himself into her. She took their money, arched her hips and loathed them. Hate made a potent catalyst for passion.\n Her customers went away satisfied, and she saved every coin.\n One night she\u0027d packed her meager belongings, stolen another twenty dollars from the can her mother kept hidden in the rafters and headed west.\n She\u0027d worked saloons in the early years, enjoying the fancy clothes and bottles of paint. Her affair with whiskey had blossomed and helped her smile and seduce hungry-eyed cowboys and rough-handed drifters.\n She\u0027d saved, keeping her mouth firmly shut about the bonuses she wheedled from men.\n When she\u0027d turned eighteen she had had enough to open her own place. A far cry from the Silver Star, Carlotta remembered. Her first brothel had been hardly more than a shack in a stinking cattle town in-east Texas. But she\u0027d made certain her girls were as young and pretty as she could get.\n She\u0027d had a brief affair with a gambler who\u0027d sported brocade vests and string ties. He\u0027d filled her head with talk of crystal chandeliers and red carpets. When she\u0027d moved on, she\u0027d taken his pearl stickpin, two hundred in cash and her own profits.\n Then she\u0027d opened the Silver Star.\n One day she\u0027d move on again, on to California. But she intended to do it in style. She\u0027d have those crystal chandeliers, she vowed. And a white porcelain tub with gold handles. Gold.\n Carlotta felt a pleasure flow through her, a pleasure as fluid as the whiskey. It was gold she needed to bring her dream to full life. And gold she intended to have. The man beside her was the tool she would use to gain it.\n Jim Carlson. Carlotta looked down at his face. It was rough with several days\u0027 growth of beard and slack from sleep, sex and whiskey. She knew him for a fool, hot-tempered, small-minded and easily manipulated. Still, he was better-looking than many she had taken into her bed. His body was tough and lean, but she preferred young, limber bodies. Like Jake\u0027s. Scowling, Carlotta took another drink. She\u0027d broken her most important rule with Jake Redman. She\u0027d let herself want him, really want him, in a way she\u0027d never desired another man. Her body had responded to his so that for the first time in her life she hadn\u0027t feigned the ecstasy men wanted from a whore. She\u0027d felt it. Now she craved it, as she craved whiskey, and gold, and power.\n With Jake, desire was a hot, tight fist in her gut. Not just because he had a style in bed most men who came to her didn\u0027t feel obliged to employ. Because Jake Redman held something of himself back, something she sensed was powerful and exciting. Something she wanted for herself. And had been on her way to getting, she thought, before that pasty-faced bitch had come to town.\n She had a lot to pay Miss Sarah Conway back for. Thoughtful, Carlotta touched a hand to her bruised cheek. A whole lot. Pay her back she would, and in doing so she would take Jake and the gold.\n Jim Carlson, though he was unaware of it, was going to help her on all counts.\n Setting the empty glass aside, Carlotta picked up a hand mirror. The bruises annoyed her, but they would fade. The faint lines fanning out from her eyes and bracketing her mouth would not. They would only deepen. She cursed and pushed the mirror aside. With a pleased smile, she ran both hands down her body. It was long, smooth-skinned and curvaceous.\n It was her body men wanted and her body she had used, and would continue to use, to get what life had cheated her of.\n She shifted, took Jim in her hand and brought him breathlessly awake.\n \"God Almighty, Carlotta,\" Groaning, he tried to roll over and into her.\n \"In a hurry, Jim?\" She evaded him expertly, all the while using her skill to keep him aroused.\n \"Thought you\u0027d burned the life out of me last night.\" He shuddered. \"Glad to find out it ain\u0027t so.\" \"I want to talk to you, Jim.\"\n \"Talk.\" He filled his hands with her breasts.\n \"Honey, I got better ways to spend my money than talk.\"\n She let him suck and nuzzle, calculating how far she could let him go and keep him in line. Rooting about like a puppy, she thought in disgust while she stroked his hair.\n \"Your money ran out at dawn, sweetheart.\"\n \"I got more.\" He bit her, hard. Because she knew he expected it, she gave a soft moan of pleasure. \"House rules, Jim. Money first.\"\n He swore at her and considered taking his pleasure as he chose. But if he forced her and managed to avoid getting tossed out by Eli, the doors of the Silver Star would be barred to him. He had money, he thought. And a need that was rock-hard.\n When he started to shift, Carlotta trailed a finger down his arm. \"Talk, Jim, and I\u0027ll...\" With a long sigh, she arched back so that he could look his fill.\n \"I\u0027ll give you the rest for free.\"\n Sweat beaded on his upper lip as he studied her.\n \"You don\u0027t do nothing for free.\"\n Deliberately she ran a hand over her breast and down her rib cage and stroked the soft swell of her belly. \"Talk. We\u0027re going to talk first.\" Her lips curved as she watched him swallow. \"About gold.\" When he stiffened, her smile only widened. \"Don\u0027t worry, Jim. I haven\u0027t told anyone, have I? I\u0027ve never said a word about how you and Donley killed old Matt Conway.\"\n \"I was drunk when I told you about that.\" He wiped a hand over the back of his mouth as fear and desire twined inside him. \"A man says all kinds of things when he\u0027s drunk.\"\n That made her laugh. She pillowed her head on her folded arms \"Nobody knows that better than a whore or a wife, honey. Relax. Who was the one who told you old Matt had finally hit? Who was the one who told you his daughter was coming and you had to move fast? Don\u0027t try dealing from the bottom with me, sweetheart. It\u0027s business, remember. Yours and mine.\"\n After pushing himself up in bed, he reached bad-temperedly for the whiskey bottle. \"I told you once Sam got things worked out you\u0027d get your share.\" \"And what does Sam have to work out?\" She let him take a swallow, two. It never hurt to loosen a man\u0027s tongue, but there were some who went from relaxed to mean with whiskey. With Jim the line was all too easily crossed. She took the bottle back.\n \"We\u0027ve already been through this,\" he muttered. He no longer felt like having sex, and he sure as hell didn\u0027t want to talk.\n \"If Sam had some idea about getting that Conway bitch to the altar to get his hands on the deed, he\u0027s had time enough. Everybody in town knows she doesn\u0027t have her eye on your brother, but on Jake Redman.\" \"How about you?\" He tapped a finger, none too gently, against her bruised cheekbone. \"Who do you have those blue eyes on?\"\n \"The main chance, sweetheart. Always the main chance.\" She ran her tongue over her lips, grimly pleased with the way Jim\u0027s eyes followed the movement. The surest way to lead a man, she knew, was from a point just below his gunbelt. She rose, knowing the shuttered light would be flattering to her skin. Slowly she ran her hands up her body, letting them linger on her breasts.\n \"You know, Jim,\" she began, slipping into a thin red negligee that was as transparent as glass, \"I\u0027ve always been drawn to men who take risks, who know what they want and take it.\" She left the negligee open as she walked back toward the bed. \"That night you came in and told me how you and Donley had dragged Matt up to the mine and how you\u0027d killed him because he wouldn\u0027t hand over the deed. You told me just how you\u0027d killed him, how you\u0027d hurt him first. Remember that night, Jim? You and me sure had ourselves a good time after we came upstairs.\"\n He wet his lips. Her nipples were dark and just out of reach. \"I remember.\"\n \"It was exciting. Knowing you\u0027d just come from killing a man. Killing him to get what you wanted. I knew I was with a real man.\" The negligee fell carelessly off one shoulder. \"Trouble is, nothing\u0027s happened since. I keep waiting.\"\n \"I told you. Sam\u0027s going-\"\n \"The hell with Sam.\" She battled back her temper to smile at him. \"He\u0027s too slow, too careful. A real man takes action. If he wants the Conway girl, why doesn\u0027t he just take her? Or you could take her for him.\" She moved closer, letting the idea take root. \"She\u0027s all that\u0027s in the way, Jim. You deal with her-and I ain\u0027t talking-about firing one of her sheds.\" The quick wariness in his eyes pleased her. \"Hurt her, Jim. She\u0027ll hand over the deed quick enough. Then kill her.\" She murmured the words like a love song.\n \"When she\u0027s dead, you come to me. We can do anything you want.\" She stood beside the bed, glorious and gleaming. \"Anything. And it won\u0027t cost you a cent.\"\n She didn\u0027t cry out when his hand clamped over her wrist. Their faces were close, each of them aroused in different ways, for different reasons.\n \"You\u0027ll take care of her?\"\n \"Yes, damn you. Come here.\"\n Carlotta smiled bitterly at the ceiling while Jim collapsed on top of her.\n From her window an hour later, Carlotta watched as Jake rode into town. Her hands clenched into fists- from anger, yes, but also from a stab of desire. Soon, she thought, very soon, he\u0027d come back to her.\n She turned as Jim pulled up his pants. She was smiling. \"I think it\u0027s a real good time for you to pay Sarah Conway a visit.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lawless/page-13.html","bookId":2686,"book":{"id":2686,"title":"Lawless","description":"Storyline: \n Lawless (Love by Design: Jack\u0027s Stories 0.5) \n Filled with Nora\u0027s exquisite storytelling and memorable characters, this rare Western historical romance is a unique treat for Nora\u0027s many fans.
