This town, you know.”\n “You know there was a cop, a detective that went missing a while back? Name was Appleton? Black guy? Started ranting about the end of the world, then vanished like a puff of smoke?”\n “I think I heard about that.”\n Drake said, “You know who was the very last person he interrogated before he went missing?”\n “Me?”\n “That’s right. That’s right. And they never found him.”\n Being a cop in Undisclosed is not a path to long-term mental or physical health, Drake. Check the suicide rate. And I’ll tell you something else, too. The look I saw in the eyes of that guy before he went off the edge is the same look I see in yours now.\n Out loud I said, “Why are you here, Drake?”\n “I need a movie,” he said brightly. “Gonna stay in tonight.”\n “Okay.”\n “Why don’t you recommend something for me? Something fun.”\n I reached over and plucked the first movie off a pile of returns to my left. Mulholland Drive, some David Lynch movie I had never heard of. There was no anti-theft tag on the case of this one. Almost like we wanted it to get stolen.\n “Here,” I said. “This is a good one.”\n “It’s something my kid will sit through?”\n “Sure.”\n I rang him up and he sidled from the counter. Drake put his hand on the door as I picked up another DVD and let out the breath I had been holding. Then, just as he was stepping out into the cold, I heard myself say, “There wasn’t anybody else reported missing today, was there?”\n He stopped, and turned. He let his gaze stay on me for a moment before saying, “No. Why?”\n He’s gonna remember you asking when somebody does come up missing, you stupid fuck.\n “No reason,” I said. I recovered with, “Whatever happened to Amy, I didn’t want it to happen to somebody else.”\n “Yeah.”\n He waited for a moment, like he had something else to say, but turned and walked out instead. My cell phone rang. Everybody had taken to downloading songs to replace the ringers on their cell phones but me; I just set mine to ring again. One less thing to worry about. I pulled it from my pants pocket and saw John’s name on the display. I answered, “Hello?”\n “I TOLD YOU TO LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE, VINNY!”\n “You called me, John.”\n “That’s right. Sorry. Have you seen the trees? Isn’t it pretty?”\n “That guy came back, John. The guy who showed up in my car last night. He came back and I thought it was a dream but I’m starting to think it wasn’t.”\n “Did you kill him?”\n “No, John. And thank you for asking me that over a cell phone.”\n “Speaking of which, did you find out about the you-know-what in your toolshed? As in, a name?”\n “No, the dead body in my you-know-what is still a mystery. I have to get back to work. What do you need?”\n “You gotta leave the store.”\n “I can’t, I’m the only one here.”\n “Close the store, then. Close the store and get outta there.”\n “What? Why?”\n “You’ll see. Meet me at the safe house. Noon. You’re not gonna believe this shit.”\n “THE SAFE HOUSE” was our code name for Denny’s.\n I arrived and saw John at a far corner booth, a bundle of papers in his hand, a pair of boobs next to him attached to a girl. This wasn’t Crystal, the tall girl with the electric blue eyes and short hair and the peasant skirts, nor was it Angie, the sexy librarian girl with the dark-rimmed glasses and ponytails and capri pants. It wasn’t Nina, with the criminally short skirts and green streaks in her hair, or Nicky the Bitch.\n This one was Marcy. Oh, Marcy. Contrary to the wisdom of the gay men who run the fashion industry (who, coincidentally, prefer their female models to look like thin males), the hottest girl I ever saw in real life weighed probably one hundred and fifty pounds. And her name was Marcy Hansen. And she was John’s girl. Rusty reddish-brown hair, about the same color as Molly’s, wide cobalt-blue eyes that looked at you like you were the most important person in the world.\n I sat, we greeted each other. Out of the corner of my eye, off to the left of Marcy’s boobs, John waved around the papers and said, “You gotta read this.”\n At that moment I realized I was boob-staring and I took the papers from John. Marcy wore tan cargo pants and a skintight T-shirt that said, I SWAM THE NAKED MILE! Marcy was one of those girls who seemed to have an endless supply of stories that involved some kind of hilarious sexual misadventure and/or accidental nudity. I took the papers from John’s hand. I studied Marcy’s boobs carefully. I caught myself, again, and held up the papers to obscure the supple swell of her bosoms. The papers were a printout, a log of the chat Amy was on the night she got abducted last time.\n “I saw Amy this morning,” John said. “I stopped by to, you know, make sure she was still there. She was pretty freaked out, reading that.”\n I read, but didn’t understand until the last third or so and, at that point, everything changed.\n This, I thought, is the end. One way or another, this is gonna be the end.\n CHAPTER 13\n The Chat Transcript\n * JOHNNY_5 HAS LOGGED OUT *\n {faierydust} asshole\n {MustacheGirl} Still there girl?\n {faierydust} hes banned\n {EVLNYMPH} dialup sux\n {amy_sullivan} still here\n {EVLNYMPH} anybody else lagging?\n {faierydust} this is the creepiest thing ive ever done\n {MustacheGirl} You should look out the window.
