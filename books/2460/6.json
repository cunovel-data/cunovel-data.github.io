{"id":81114,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"ON HER WAY TO THE BAR JACK, JILL THOUGHT she heard gunfire. She paused in the alley that would eventually lead her to the tavern\u0027s back entrance, head cocked to one side. It sounded like shots, like an automatic, but it was too far away for her to be sure. Still, her spirits lifted a little at the thought that she might not be fighting alone, that help might be on the way...... right. A hundred good guys have landed with bazookas, inoculations, and a can of whoop ass, maybe a steak dinner with my name on it to boot. They\u0027re all attractive, straight, and single, with college degrees and perfect teeth... \"Let\u0027s try to stick to reality, how \u0027bout,\" she said softly and was relieved that she sounded fairly normal, even in the dank and shadowy quiet of the back alley. She\u0027d been feeling pretty bleak back in the warehouse, even after finding a thermos of still-warm coffee in the upstairs office; the idea of trekking through the dead city one more time, alone - - is what I have to do, she thought firmly, so I\u0027m doing it. As her dear, incarcerated father was fond of saying, wishing that things were different didn\u0027t make it so. She took a few steps forward, pausing when she was about five feet from where the alley branched. To her right was a series of streets and alleys that would lead her further into town; left would take her past a tiny courtyard, with a path straight to the bar - assuming that she knew this area as well as she thought she did. Jill edged closer to the junction, moving as silently as she knew how, her back to the south wall. It was quiet enough for her to risk a quick look down the alley to the right, her weapon preceding her; all clear. She shifted position, stepping sideways across the empty path to look in the direction she meant to go - and heard it, uunnh, the soft, pining cry of a male carrier, half hidden by shadow perhaps four meters away. Jill targeted the darkest part of the shadow and waited sadly for it to step into view, reminding herself that it wasn\u0027t really human, not anymore. She knew that, had known it since what had happened at the Spencer estate, but she encouraged the feelings of pity and sorrow that she felt each time she had to put one of them down. Having to tell herself that each zombie was beyond hope allowed her to feel compassion for them. Even the shambling, decomposing mess that now swayed into view had once been a person. She didn\u0027t, couldn\u0027t let herself get overly emotional about it, but if she ever forgot that they were victims rather than mon-sters, she would lose some essential element of her own humanity. A single shot to its right temple, and the zombie col-lapsed into a puddle of its own fetid fluids. He was pretty far gone, his eyes cataracted, his gray-green flesh sliding from his softening bones; Jill had to breathe through her mouth as she stepped over him, careful to avoid getting him on her boots. Another step and she was looking down on the court-yard - - and she saw two more zombies standing below, but also a flash of movement disappearing into the alley, heading toward the bar. It was too fast to be one of the carriers. Jill only caught a glimpse of camo pants and a black combat boot, but it was enough to confirm what she\u0027d hoped - a person. It was a living person. From the small set of steps that led down into the yard, Jill quickly dispatched both carriers, her heart pounding with hope. Camouflage gear. He or she was military, maybe someone sent in on reconnaissance; perhaps her little fantasy wasn\u0027t so far-fetched after all. She hurried past the fallen creatures, running as soon as she hit the alley, up a few steps, ten meters of brick, and she was at the back door. Jill took a deep breath and opened the door care-fully, not wanting to surprise anyone who might be packing a gun...... and saw a zombie lurching across the tiled floor of the small bar, moaning hungrily as it reached out for a man in a tan vest, a man who pointed what looked like a small-caliber handgun at the closing creature and opened fire. Jill immediately joined him, accomplishing in two shots what he was unable to do in five; the carrier fell to its knees, and, with a final, desperate groan, it died, settling to the floor like liquid. Jill couldn\u0027t tell if it had been male or female, and at the moment, she didn\u0027t give a rat\u0027s ass. She turned her eager attention to the soldier, an in-troduction rising to her lips, and realized that it was Brad Vickers, Alpha team pilot for the disbanded S.T.A.R.S. Brad, whose nickname had been Chicken-heart Vickers, who\u0027d stranded the Alpha team at the Spencer estate when he\u0027d been too afraid to stay, who\u0027d crept out of town when he\u0027d realized that Umbrella knew their names. A good pilot and a genius computer hacker, but when push came to shove, Brad Vickers was a grade-A weasel. And I\u0027m glad to see him, regardless.\"Brad, what are you doing here? Are you okay?\" She did her best to keep from asking how he\u0027d man-aged to survive, though she had to wonder - espe-cially since he only seemed to be armed with a cheap.32 semi and had been the worst shot in the S.T.A.R.S. As it was, he didn\u0027t look good - there were splatters of dried blood on his vest and his eyes were haunted, wide and rolling with barely controlled panic. \"Jill! I didn\u0027t know you were still alive!\" If he was glad to see her, he was hiding it well, and he still hadn\u0027t answered her question. \"Yeah, well, I could say the same,\" she said, working not to sound too accusatory. He might have information she could use. \"When did you get here? Do you know anything about what\u0027s going on outside of town?\" It was as though every word she said compounded his fear. His posture was tense, wound up, and he had the shakes. He opened his mouth to answer, but nothing came out. \"Brad, what is it? What\u0027s wrong?\" she asked, but he was already backing toward the front door of the bar, shaking his head from side to side. \"It\u0027s coming for us,\" he breathed. \"For the S.T.A.R.S. The police are dead, they can\u0027t do anything to stop it, just like they couldn\u0027t stop this...\" Brad waved one trembling hand at the bloody creature on the floor. \"You\u0027ll see.\" He was on the edge of hysteria, his brown hair slick with sweat, his jaw clenched. Jill moved toward him, not sure what to do. His fear was contagious. \"What\u0027s coming, Brad?\" \"You\u0027ll see!\" With that, Brad turned and snatched the door open, blind panic tripping him as he stumbled out into the street and took off running without looking back. Jill took one step toward the closing door and stopped, suddenly thinking that maybe there were worse things than being alone. Trying to take care of anyone as she made her way out of Raccoon - particularly a hysterical man with a history of cowardice who was too scared to be reasonable - was probably a bad idea. She felt a chill thinking about what he\u0027d said, though. What was coming, specifically for the S.T.A.R.S.? He seems to think I\u0027ll find out. Unsettled, Jill mentally wished him luck and turned toward the polished bar, hoping that the ancient Rem-ington was still tucked under the register and wonder-ing what the hell Chickenheart Vickers was doing in Raccoon, and what, exactly, had him so terrified. Mitch Hirami was dead. So were Sean Olson, and Deets, Bjorklund, and Waller, and Tommy, and the two new guys, who Carlos couldn\u0027t remember except one of them was always cracking his knuckles and the other one had freckles... Stop it, just knock it off! It doesn\u0027t matter now, all that matters is getting us out of here. The wails had fallen far enough behind for Carlos to feel they could stop for a minute, after running for what felt like forever. Randy\u0027s limp seemed to be getting worse with every step, and Carlos desperately needed to catch his breath, just to think... ...about how they died, about the woman who bit into Olson\u0027s throat and the blood that ran down her chin, and the way that Waller started to laugh, high and crazy, just before he threw his weapon away and let himself be taken, and the sound of somebody screaming prayers at the uncaring sky... Stop it! They leaned against the back wall of a convenience store, a fenced recycling area with only one way in and a clear view of the street. There was no sound except the faraway singing of birds, wafting over them on a cooling, late afternoon breeze that smelled faintly of rot. Randy had slid into a sitting position, pulling his right boot off to take a look at his wound. His lower pant leg was shiny wet with blood, as was the collar of his shirt. He and Randy were the only two that had made it, and just barely; already, it seemed like some impossible dream. The others in the squad had already gone down, and there were at least six of the cannibal zombies still coming at him and Randy. Carlos had fired again and again, the smells of burning gunpowder and blood combining with the stench of decay, all of it making him dizzy with adrenaline-driven horror, so disori-ented that he hadn\u0027t seen Randy fall, hadn\u0027t realized it until he\u0027d heard the sound of Randy\u0027s skull smacking into the pavement, loud even over the cries of the dead. A crawling one had grabbed Randy and bitten through the leather of his boot; Carlos had slammed the butt of his M16 down, breaking its neck, his mind screaming uselessly that it had been eating Randy\u0027s ankle, and he\u0027d scooped up the half-conscious soldier with a strength he didn\u0027t know he possessed. And they had run, Carlos dragging his injured comrade away from the slaughter, his thoughts incoherent and wild and, in their own way, as terrifying to him as the rest of it. For a few minutes, he\u0027d been loco, unable to understand what had happened, what was still hap-pening... \"Aw, Jesus, man...\" Carlos looked down at the sound of Randy\u0027s voice, noticing with some alarm that his words were a little slurred, and saw the ragged edges of a deep bite maybe two inches above the top of his foot. Thick blood oozed steadily out, the inside of Randy\u0027s boot drenched with it. \"Bit me, goddamn thing bit right in. But it was dead, Carlos. They were all dead... weren\u0027t they?\" Randy looked up at him, his eyes dazed with pain and some-thing more, something that neither of them could af-ford - confusion, bad enough that Randy could barely focus. Concussion, maybe. Whatever it was, Randy needed a hospital. Carlos crouched next to him, his heart sick as he tore off a piece of Randy\u0027s shirt and quickly folded it into a compress. We\u0027re screwed, there were no cops out there, no paramedics, this city is dying or already dead. If we want help, we\u0027re going to have to find it ourselves, and he\u0027s in no shape to fight. \"This may hurt a little, \u0027mono, but we gotta stop you from getting your boot all wet,\" Carlos said, trying to sound relaxed as he pressed the folded material against Randy\u0027s bleeding ankle. There was no point in scaring him, especially if he was as whacked out as Carlos thought. \"Hold it down tight, okay?\" Randy clenched his jaw, a violent tremor running through him, but he did as Carlos asked and held the makeshift bandage in place. As Randy leaned forward, Carlos studied the back of his head, wincing inwardly at the bloody, slightly misshapen spot beneath his tan-gled black curls. It didn\u0027t seem to be bleeding anymore, at least. \"We gotta get outta here, Carlos,\" Randy said. \"Let\u0027s go home, okay? I want to go home.\" \"Soon,\" Carlos said softly. \"Let\u0027s just sit here and rest for another minute, and then we\u0027ll go.\" He thought about all of the wrecked cars they\u0027d run past, the piles of broken furniture and wood and brick in the streets, hastily assembled blockades. Assuming they could even find a car with keys in it, just about every street was impassable. Carlos didn\u0027t have a pilot\u0027s license, but he had flown a helicopter a few times - fine, if they happened to stumble across an airport. We\u0027ll never make it on foot, though. Even if Randy wasn\u0027t hurt, the entire U.B.C.S. was taken out, or damn near close. There\u0027s gotta be hundreds, maybe thou-sands of those things out there. If they could find other survivors, group to-gether... but tracking anyone down in this nightmare would be a nightmare all its own. The thought of Trent\u0027s restaurant occurred to him briefly, but he ig-nored it; to hell with that crazy shit, they needed to get out of town, and they needed help to do it. The squad leaders were the only ones who\u0027d known the plan for pickup, or had radios, and there was no way Carlos was going to go back - - but I don\u0027t have to, do I? He closed his eyes for a minute, realizing that he\u0027d missed the obvious; maybe he was more freaked than he thought. There was more than one radio in the world; all he had to do was find one. Send out a call to the transports - hell, to anyone listening - and wait for somebody to show up. \"I don\u0027t feel so good,\" Randy said, so quietly that Carlos almost didn\u0027t hear him, the slur of his words more pronounced than before. \"Itches, it itches.\" Carlos squeezed his shoulder lightly, the heat from Randy\u0027s feverish skin radiating out from beneath his T-shirt. \"You\u0027re going to be okay, bro, just hang on, I\u0027m going to get us out of here.\" He sounded confident enough. Carlos only wished that he could convince himself.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nemesis-resident-evil-5/page-6.html","bookId":2460,"book":{"id":2460,"title":"Nemesis (Resident Evil #5)","description":"Storyline: Zombies.
