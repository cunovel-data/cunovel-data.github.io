If this didn\u0027t work, he was going to be deeply - no, majesti-cally pissed. Hell with it. If this doesn\u0027t work, we should just walk out, or see if we can get to that factory and steal our-selves a ride. She\u0027s right, these people are andar lurias, lost in space; the sooner we get out of their territory, the better. He stared blankly out at the dark yard for a few mo-ments, so bone-weary that he wondered how he would do one more thing, take one more step; it seemed im-possible. All that kept him going was his desire to leave, to get away from this holocaust and try to re-cover. When the first massive peal of sound rang out, its deep and hollow tone rolling out from the top of the tower, Carlos realized he couldn\u0027t keep a lid on his hope. He tried, telling himself that there was going to be a glitch in the program, telling himself that Um-brella would send assassins, that the pilot would be a zombie; nothing worked. A helicopter was coming for them, he knew it, he believed it; he just hoped the res-cue team wouldn\u0027t have any trouble finding a place to land...... spotlights! There were four of them on the ledge and a crusty-looking control box near the door that led back inside; the light would guide the transport in faster. Carlos hurried toward it, glancing up to see if Jill had started down yet. She hadn\u0027t...... and when he looked ahead again, he saw that he wasn\u0027t alone. As if by magic, the giant, mutilated freak that had been chasing Jill was simply there, close enough for Carlos to smell a burnt meat smell, snarling, its piggy, distorted gaze turned to the top of the ladder. \"Carlos, look out!\" Jill screamed down, but the Nemesis-monster ignored him completely, taking a mammoth step toward the ladder, the eyeless snakes that were its tentacles whipping around its colossal head. One more step and it would be at the base of the ladder and Jill would be trapped. - she said bullets don\u0027t hurt it Desperate to do something, Carlos saw the large green power switch on the spotlights\u0027 control panel and lunged for it, not sure what he expected. To distract it, if they were lucky...... and all four lights snapped on at once, blinding, instantly heating the air around them and illuminating the tower, probably for miles to see. One of the beams was full-on blocked by the freak\u0027s hideous face. The light actually forced the thing to stumble backwards, giant hands covering its mutant eyes, and Carlos acted. He ran at the blinded Nemesis, M16 held high, and slammed the rifle against its chest, pushing as hard as he could. Off balance, it stumbled backwards, its legs slapping the ancient railing...... and with a brittle snap, a wide section of the rail-ing gave way, falling into the darkness, the Nemesis plummeting after it. Carlos heard a sickly thump from the ground below at the same instant that the over-heated spotlights shut down, making glowing dark shapes float in Carlos\u0027s eyes for a moment. The huge, mellow sound of the bells continued to fill the air as Jill scrambled down the ladder and un-slung the grenade launcher, joining Carlos at the bro-ken railing. \"I... thanks,\" Jill said, looking into his eyes, her own gaze sincere and unwavering. \"If you hadn\u0027t hit the lights, I would have been dead. Thank you.\" Carlos was impressed and a little flustered by her candor. \"De nada,\" he said, suddenly very aware of how attractive she was - not just physically - and how little experience he actually had with women. He was a self-educated twenty-one-year-old mere, and he hadn\u0027t exactly had a whole lot of time or opportunity to date. She can\u0027t be much older, twenty-five at the outside, and maybe she... Jill snapped her fingers in front of him, bringing him back to reality and reminding him of how tired he re-ally was. He\u0027d totally spaced out. \"You still with me?\"Carlos nodded, clearing his throat. \"Yeah, sorry. Didyou say something?\"I said we need to move. If it\u0027s still that feisty after a grenade in the face, I doubt a two-story drop will kill it.\"Right,\" Carlos said. \"We should circle around front,anyway. They\u0027ll probably drop a harness if they can\u0027tset down.\"Jill nodded. \"Let\u0027s do it.\"Ushered inside by the deep voice of hollowed metal,Carlos suddenly wondered if Nicholai was still alive and if he was, what he would do when he heard the tolling bells. Nicholai heard the bells on his walk back into town and scoffed irritably, refusing to be baited. He hadn\u0027t expected the barely skilled trio to make it, but so what if they had? Davis Chan had filed another report, from a woman\u0027s boutique of all places, and Nicholai meant to track him down. And why should I care if they limp away with their miserable lives, with what I\u0027ve got? Nicholai pulled the slender metal case out of his pocket for the third time since leaving the hospital, un-able to resist. Inside was a glass vial of purplish fluid that he\u0027d synthesized himself, with a little help from an instruction sheet that Aquino\u0027s assistant had thought-fully left behind. Nicholai knew it would be safest to store the sample someplace, but the small container represented his au-thority over the other Watchdogs and a newly elevated status with Umbrella; he was a leader, a supervisor of lesser men, and he found that carrying the vaccine with him and occasionally holding it made him feel power-ful. Grounded, in a way. Smiling, Nicholai slipped the container back into his pocket, within easy reach, and started walking again, deliberately ignoring the bells. Things were going very well - he had the vaccine; he knew where Chan was and where Franklin was going to be in just under forty-eight hours; he\u0027d already rigged the hospital to blow; and he would push the button as soon as his meeting with Franklin was over. Nicholai thought he might duck over to the factory and get rid of Terence Foster while he waited on Franklin, there was plenty of time just like there was plenty of time to track Mikhail, to play at being a noble team member, to decide who would die first among them... The clamorous bells pounded at him, seeking to re-mind him of his failure, but he refused to be distracted by the escape of three incompetents. He was getting closer to town, he could see the combined glow of hun-dreds of small and not so small fires encasing the dark city; even if he wanted to, he wouldn\u0027t make it back to the clock tower before the first helicopter came. And he didn\u0027t want to, he\u0027d had the opportunity after killing Aquino and had decided that it wasn\u0027t worth his time. It was the right decision... and the strange doubts that curled up inside of him at the sound of the bells were to be disregarded; it meant nothing, that they had sur-vived, it didn\u0027t mean that they were as good as him. Besides, he still had a few dogs to put down to en-sure his monopoly on information. He thought that Chan might choose to bunk down at the store he\u0027d re-ported from, as late as it was. Nicholai would kill him, take his data, and retire for the evening somewhere in the city. At the Watchdog briefing he\u0027d heard that food was scarce, but he was certain that he could manage raid a few pantries for canned goods, perhaps. In the morning he would file his own report, to keep up his cover, and spend the day hunting up information of his own before heading west again. Everything was fine, and as he gradually crossed over from the suburbs into the city, the sound of the ap-proaching helicopter didn\u0027t bother him a bit. Let those spineless, shit-eating bastards run, he felt great, in con-trol, better than great. He only had a headache because of those damned bells. They retraced much of their winding path through the clock tower, Jill wanting to make sure the Neme-sis either got confused or had plenty of time to wan-der away before they went out to meet the \u0027copter. As they walked, they hammered out a story to tell who-ever was running the evac - Jill was Kimberly Sampsel (the name of Jill\u0027s best friend from fifth grade), she\u0027d worked at a local art gallery, no family, and she\u0027d only moved to Raccoon recently. Carlos had found her just after his platoon leader, the only other U.B.C.S. member to have survived, had been killed by zombies. Together, they\u0027d made it to the clock tower, end of story. They decided not to mention Nicholai, the Nemesis, or any unidentifiable creatures they\u0027d seen running around; the idea was to appear as ignorant of the facts as possible. Neither of them wanted to take any chances on the allegiance of the rescue team, and Jill had no doubt that there would be someone on the trans-port waiting to debrief them, so the simpler the story, the better. They\u0027d just have to pray that no one had her pic on hand. They could worry about how to slip away once they got out of the city. At the front doors of the clock tower they paused for a moment, readying themselves, Jill feeling a strange mixture of happiness and anxiety. Rescue was coming, but they were so close to getting out now that she was afraid something would go wrong. Maybe that\u0027s just because Umbrella is doing the res-cuing, God knows they don\u0027t have a very good trackrecord for keeping their shit together...\"Jill? Before we leave, I want to tell you something,\" Carlos said, and for a few seconds, Jill thought her anx-iety was about to be confirmed, that he was going to tell her some terrible secret he\u0027d been holding back, but then she saw his careful, thoughtful expression and thought different. \"Okay, shoot,\" she said neutrally, thinking about the way he\u0027d looked at her out on the balcony. She\u0027d seen that look before, from other men - and she wasn\u0027t sure how she felt about it from Carlos. Before he\u0027d left for Europe, Chris Redfield and she had been getting pretty close... \"Before I came here, I was approached by this guy about Raccoon, about what was going on here,\" Carlos started, and Jill had just enough time to feel stupid about her assumption before-his words sank in. Trent!\"He told me that we were in for a rough time, andoffered to help me out. I thought he was crazy atfirst...\"... but then you got here and found out he wasn\u0027t.\"Carlos stared at her. \"You know him or something?\"Probably as well as you do. It was the same withme, just before the estate mission, he gave me informa-tion about the mansion and told me to be careful whoI trusted. Trent, right?\" Carlos nodded, and although they both opened their mouths to speak, neither of them said a word. It was the sound of the approaching helicopter that cut them off, that made both of them grin and exchange looks of joy and relief. \"Let\u0027s talk about him later,\" Carlos said, pushing open the front doors, the chop of the \u0027copter\u0027s blades filling the tower\u0027s lobby as they both stepped out into the yard. Jill only saw one transport helicopter but didn\u0027t care, there obviously wasn\u0027t anyone else to evacuate, and as it swung over the crashed trolley, she and Carlos both started to wave their arms and shout. \"Over here! We\u0027re over here!\" Jill screamed, and she actually saw the clean-shaven face of the pilot, his smile glowing by the lights in the cockpit as he flew closer close enough that she could see the smile disap-pear hi the same instant that she heard the weapon dis-charge to their right, a look of horror dawning on that youthful face. Shhhh... A line of colored smoke, streaking toward the hover-ing ship from someone on the roof of the tower\u0027s ad-junct buildings, surface to air, bazooka or rocket launcher......BOOM! \"No,\" Jill whispered, but the sound was lost as the missile slammed into the \u0027copter and exploded, Jill numbly thinking that it had to be a HEAT rocket to do the damage it was doing as the airship spun toward them, listing badly to one side, fire spouting from the shattered cockpit. Carlos grabbed her arm and yanked, almost jerking her off her feet, pulling her out into the yard as a high, climbing, whining noise blew over them, the burning helicopter stuttering forward as they huddled behind the fountain...... and then it crashed into the clock tower. Flaming chunks of metal and stone and wood showered down upon them as the transport plunged through the roof of the lobby, and like the voice of destruction, Jill heard the Nemesis\u0027s triumphant scream rising above it all.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nemesis-resident-evil-5/page-19.html","bookId":2460,"book":{"id":2460,"title":"Nemesis (Resident Evil #5)","description":"Storyline: Zombies.
