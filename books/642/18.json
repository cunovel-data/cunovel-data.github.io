{"id":43020,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII","content":"Samuel went home walking upon air. He had found a place for himself and a place for Sophie. And he had got the reforming of Bertie Lockman under way! Truly, the church was a great institution—the solution of all the puzzles and problems of life. And fortunate was Samuel to be so close to the inner life of things! Then suddenly, on a street corner, he stopped short. A sign had caught his eye—“John Callahan, Wines and Liquors—Bernheimer Beer.” “Do you know what that place is?” he said to Sophie. “That\u0027s where my friend Finnegan works.” “Who\u0027s Finnegan?” asked the child. “He\u0027s the barkeeper who gave me something to eat when I first came to town. He\u0027s a good man, even if he is a barkeeper.” Samuel had often found himself thinking of Finnegan; for it had been altogether against his idea of things that a man so obviously well meaning should be selling liquor. And now suddenly a brilliant idea flashed across his mind. Why should he continue selling liquor? And instantly Samuel saw a new duty before him. He must help Finnegan. And forgetting that it was time for his dinner, he bade good-by to Sophie and went into the saloon. “Well, young feller!” exclaimed the Irishman, his face lighting up with pleasure; and then, seeing the boy\u0027s new collar and tie, “Gee, you\u0027re moving up in the world!” “I\u0027ve got a job,” said Samuel proudly. “I\u0027m the assistant sexton at St. Matthew\u0027s Church.” “You don\u0027t say! Gone up with the sky pilots, hey!” Samuel did not notice this irreverent remark. He looked around the place and saw that they were alone. Then he said, very earnestly, “Mr. Finnegan, may I have a few minutes\u0027 talk with you?” “Sure,” said Finnegan perplexed. “What is it?” “It\u0027s something I\u0027ve been thinking about very often,” said Samuel. “You were so kind to me, and I saw that you were a good-hearted man. And so it has always seemed to me too bad that you should be selling drink.” The other stared at him. “Gee!” he said, “are you going to take me up in your airship?” “Mr. Finnegan,” said the boy, “I wish you wouldn\u0027t make fun of me. For I\u0027m talking to you out of the bottom of my heart.” And Samuel gazed with so much yearning in his eyes that the man was touched, in spite of the absurdity of it. “Go on,” he said. “I\u0027ll listen.” “It\u0027s just this,” said Samuel. “It\u0027s wrong to sell liquor! Think what drink does to men? I saw a man drunk the other night and it led to what was almost murder. Drink makes men cruel and selfish. It takes away their self-control. It makes them unfit for their work. It leads to vice and wickedness. It enslaves them and degrades them. Don\u0027t you know that is true, Mr. Finnegan?” “Yes,” admitted Finnegan, “I reckon it is. I never touch the stuff myself.” “And still you sell it to others?” “Well, my boy, I don\u0027t do it because I hate them.” “But then, why DO you do it?” “I do it,” said Finnegan, “because I have to live. It\u0027s my trade—it\u0027s all I know.” “It seems such a terrible trade!” exclaimed the boy. “Maybe,” said the other. “But take notice, it ain\u0027t a princely one. I\u0027m on the job all day and a good part of the night, and standing up all the time. And I don\u0027t get no holidays either—and I only get twelve a week. And I\u0027ve a wife and a new baby. So what\u0027s a man to do?” Now, strange as it may seem, this unfolded a new view to Samuel. He had always supposed that bartenders and saloonkeepers were such from innate depravity. Could it really be that they were driven to the trade? The bare idea was enough to set his zeal in a blaze. “Listen,” he said. “Suppose I were to find you some kind of honest work, so that you could earn a living. Would you promise to reform?” “Do you mean would I quit Callahan\u0027s? Why, sure I would.” “Ah!” exclaimed the boy in delight. “But it\u0027d have to be a steady job,” put in the other. “I can take no chances with the baby.” “That\u0027s all right,” said Samuel. “I\u0027ll get you what you want.” “Gee, young feller!” exclaimed Finnegan. “Do you carry \u0027em round in your pockets?” “No,” said Samuel, “but Dr. Vince asked me to help him; and I\u0027m going to tell him about you.” And so, forthwith, he made his way to the doctor\u0027s house, and was ushered into the presence of the unhappy clergyman. He stated his case; and the other threw up his hands in despair. “Really,” he exclaimed, “this is too much, Samuel! I can\u0027t find employment for everyone in Lockmanville.” “But, doctor!” protested Samuel, “I don\u0027t think you understand. This man wants to lead a decent life, and he can\u0027t because there\u0027s no way for him to earn a living.” “I understand all that Samuel.” “But, doctor, what\u0027s the use of trying to reform men if they\u0027re chained in that way?” There was a pause. “I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s hopeless to explain to you,” said the clergyman. “But you\u0027ll have to make up your mind to it, Samuel—there are a great many men in the world who want jobs, and it seems to be unfortunately true that there are fewer jobs than men.” “Yes,” said the other, “but that\u0027s what Professor Stewart taught men. And you said it was wicked of him.” “Um—” said the doctor, taken aback. “Don\u0027t you see?” went on Samuel eagerly. “It puts you right back with Herbert Spencer! If there are more men than there are jobs, then the men have to fight for them. And so you have the struggle for existence, and the survival of the greedy and the selfish. If Finnegan wouldn\u0027t be a barkeeper, then he and his family would starve, and somebody else would survive who was willing to be that bad.” The boy waited. “Don\u0027t you see that, Dr. Vince?” he persisted. “Yes, I see that,” said the doctor. “And you told me that the only way to escape from that was to live for others—to serve them and help them. And isn\u0027t that what I\u0027m trying to do?” “Yes, my boy, that is so. But what can we do?” “Why, doctor, aren\u0027t you the head of the church? And the people come to you to be taught. You must point out these things to them, so that there can be a change.” “But WHAT change, Samuel?” “I don\u0027t know, sir. I\u0027m groping around and trying to find out. But I\u0027m sure of one thing—that some people have got too much money. Why, Dr. Vince, there are people right in your church who have more than they could spend in hundreds of years.” “Perhaps so,” said the other. “But what harm does that do?” “Why—that\u0027s the reason that so many others have nothing! Only realize it—right at this very moment there are people starving to death—and here in Lockmanville! They want to work, and there is no work for them! I could take you to see them, sir—girls who want a job in Mr. Wygant\u0027s cotton mill, and he won\u0027t give it to them!” “But, my boy—that isn\u0027t Mr. Wygant\u0027s fault! It\u0027s because there is too much cloth already.” “I\u0027ve been thinking about that,” said Samuel earnestly. “And it doesn\u0027t sound right to me. There are too many people who need good clothes. Look at poor Sophie, for instance!” “Yes,” said the other, “of course. But they haven\u0027t money to buy the cloth—-” And Samuel sat forward in his excitement. “Yes, yes!” he cried. “And isn\u0027t that just what I said before? They have no money, because the rich people have it all!” There was no reply; and after a moment Samuel rushed on: “Surely it is selfish of Mr. Wygant to shut poor people out of his mill, just because they have no money. Why couldn\u0027t he let them make cloth for themselves?” “Samuel!” protested the other. “That is absurd!” “But why, sir?” “Because, my boy—in a day they could make more than they could wear in a year.” “So much the better, doctor! Then they could give the balance to other people who needed it—and the other people could make things for them. Take Sophie. She not only needs clothing, she needs shoes, and above all, she needs enough to eat. And if it\u0027s a question of there not being enough food, look at what\u0027s wasted in a place like Master Albert\u0027s! And there\u0027s land enough at \u0027Fairview\u0027 to raise food for the whole town—I know what I\u0027m talking about there, because I\u0027m a farmer. And it\u0027s used to keep a lot of race horses that nobody ever rides.” “Samuel,” said the clergyman gravely, “that is true—and that is very wrong. But what can I do?” And Samuel stared at him. “Doctor!” he exclaimed. “I can\u0027t tell you how it hurts me to have you talk to me like that!” “How do you mean, Samuel?” asked the other in bewilderment. And the boy clasped his hands together in his agitation. “You told me that we must sacrifice ourselves, and help others! You said that was our sole duty! And I believed you—I was ready to go with you. And here I am—I want to follow you, and you won\u0027t lead!” Those words were like a stab. The doctor winced visibly. And Samuel winced also—his heart was wrung. “It hurts me more than I can tell you!” he cried. “But think of the people who are suffering—nobody spares them! And how can you be silent, doctor—how can the shepherd of Christ be silent while some of his flock are living in luxury and others are starving to death?” There was a long pause. Dr. Vince sat rigid, clutching the arms of his chair. “Samuel,” he said, “you are right. I will preach on this unemployed question next Sunday.” “Ah, thank you, sir—thank you!” exclaimed Samuel, with tears of gratitude in his eyes. And he took his friend\u0027s hand and wrung it. Then, suddenly, a new thought came to him. “And meantime, doctor,” said he, “what am I to tell Finnegan?”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3245/88941.html","bookId":642,"book":{"id":642,"title":"Samuel the Seeker","description":"简介： He had written these words upon the little picture of Samuel\u0027s mother, which hung in that corner of the old attic which served as the boy\u0027s bedroom; and so Samuel grew up with the knowledge that he, too, was one of the Seekers.
