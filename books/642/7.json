{"id":43009,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VII","content":"On Monday morning Samuel found that Professor Stewart had returned, and he sat in the great man\u0027s study and waited until he had finished his breakfast. It was a big room, completely walled with crowded bookshelves; in the center was a big work-table covered with books and papers. Samuel had never dreamed that there were so many books in the world, and he gazed about him with awe, feeling that he had come to the sources of knowledge. That was Samuel\u0027s way. Both by nature and training, he had a profound respect for all authority. He believed in the majesty of the law—that was why it had shocked him so to be arrested. He thought of the church as a divine institution, whose ministers were appointed as shepherds of the people. And up here on the heights was this great College, a temple of learning; and this professor was one who had been selected by those in the seats of authority, and set apart as one of its priests. So Samuel was profoundly grateful for the attention which was given to him, and was prepared to pick up whatever crumbs of counsel might be dropped. “Ah, yes,” the professor said, wiping his glasses with a silk handkerchief. “Samuel—let me see—Samuel—” “Prescott, sir.” “Yes—Samuel Prescott. And how have you been?” “I\u0027ve been very well, sir.” “I meant to leave a message for you, but I overlooked it. I had so many things to attend to in the rush of departure. I—er—I hope you didn\u0027t wait for me.” “I had nothing else to do, sir,” said Samuel. “The truth is,” continued the other, “I\u0027m afraid I shan\u0027t be able to do for you what I thought I could.” Samuel\u0027s heart went down into his boots. “You see,” said the professor a trifle embarrassed, “my sister wanted a man to look after her place, but I found she had already engaged some one.” There was a pause. Samuel simply stared. “Of course, as the man is giving satisfaction—you see—it wouldn\u0027t do for her to send him away.” And Samuel continued to stare, dumb with terror and dismay. “I\u0027m very sorry,” said the other—“no need to tell you that. But I don\u0027t know of any other place.” “But what am I to do?” burst out Samuel. “It\u0027s really too bad,” remarked the other. And again there was a silence. “Professor Stewart,” said Samuel in a low voice, “what is a man to do who is out of work and starving?” “God knows,” said the professor. And yet again there was silence. Samuel could have said that himself—he had the utmost faith in God. And after a while the professor himself seemed to realize that the reply was inadequate. “You see,” he went on, “there is a peculiar condition here in Lockmanville. There was an attempt to corner the glass industry, and that caused the building of too many factories, and so there is overproduction. And then, besides that, they\u0027ve just invented a machine that blows as many bottles as a dozen men.” “But then what are the men to do?” asked Samuel. “The condition readjusts itself,” said the other. “The men have to go into some other trade.” “But then—the cotton mills are on half time, too!” “Yes, there are too many cotton mills.” “But then—in the end there will be too many everything.” “That is the tendency,” said the professor. “There are foreign markets, of course. But the difficulty really goes deeper than that.” Professor Stewart paused and looked at Samuel wondering, perhaps, if he were not throwing away his instruction. But the boy looked very much interested, even excited. “Most of our economists are disposed to blink the truth,” said he. “But the fact is, there are too many men.” Samuel started. It was precisely that terrible suspicion which had been shaping itself in his own mind. “There is a law,” went on the other, “which was clearly set forth by Malthus, that population tends continually to outrun the food supply. And then the surplus people have to be removed.” “I see,” said Samuel, awestricken. “But isn\u0027t it rather hard?” “It seems so—to the individual. To the race it is really of the very greatest benefit. It is the process of life.” “Please tell me,” Samuel\u0027s look seemed to say. “If you will consider Nature,” Professor Stewart continued, “you will observe that she always produces many times more individuals than can possibly reach maturity. The salmon lays millions of eggs, and thousands of young trees spring up in every thicket. And these individuals struggle for a chance to live, and those survive which are strongest and best fitted to meet the conditions. And precisely the same thing is true among men—there is no other way by which the race could be improved, or even kept at its present standard. Those who perish are sacrificed for the benefit of the race.” Now, strange as it may seem, Samuel had never before heard the phrase, “the survival of the fittest.” And so now he was living over the experience of the thinking world of fifty or sixty years ago. What a marvelous generalization it was! What a range of life it covered! And how obvious it seemed—one could think of a hundred things, perfectly well known, which fitted into it. And yet he had never thought of it himself! The struggle for existence! The survival of the fittest! A few days ago Samuel had discovered music. And now he was discovering science. What an extraordinary thing was the intellect of man, which could take all the infinitely varied facts of life and interpret them in the terms of one vast law. Samuel was all aglow with excitement at the revelation. “I see,” he said, again and again—“I see!” “It is the law of life,” said the professor. “No one can escape from it.” “And then,” said Samuel, “when we try to change things—when we give out charity, for instance—we are working against Nature, and we really make things worse.” “That is it,” replied the other. And Samuel gave a great sigh. How very simple was the problem, when one had seen it in the light of science. Here he had been worrying and tormenting his brain about the matter; and all the time he was in the hands of Nature—and all he had to do was to lie back and let Nature solve it. “Nature never makes mistakes,” said Professor Stewart. Of course, in this new light Samuel\u0027s own case became plain. “Those who are out of work are those who have failed in the struggle,” he said. “Precisely,” said the professor. “And that is because they are unfit.” “Precisely,” said the professor again. “As Herbert Spencer has phrased it, \u0027Inability to catch prey must be regarded as a falling short of conduct from its ideal.\u0027 And, of course, in an industrial community, the \u0027prey\u0027 is a job.” “Who is Herbert Spencer?” asked Samuel. “He is recognized as the authority in such matters,” said the other. “And then,” pondered Samuel, “those who have jobs must be the fit. And the very rich people—the ones who make the millions and millions—they are the fittest of all.” “Er—yes,” said the professor. “And, of course, that makes my problem clear—I\u0027m out of a job, and so I must die.” The professor gazed at Samuel sharply. But it was impossible to mistake the boy\u0027s open-eyed sincerity. He had no thought about himself—he was discovering the laws of life. “I\u0027m so glad you explained it to me,” he went on. “But all these thousands of men who are starving to death—they ought to be told it, too.” “What good would it do?” asked the other. “Why, they ought to understand. They suffer, and it seems to them purposeless and stupid. But if you were to explain to them that they are being sacrificed for the benefit of the race—don\u0027t you see what a difference it would make?” “I don\u0027t believe they would take the suggestion kindly,” said the professor with a faint attempt to smile. “But why not?” asked Samuel. “Wouldn\u0027t it sound rather hypocritical, so to speak—coming from a man who had succeeded?” “Not at all! You have a right to your success, haven\u0027t you?” “I hope so.” “You have a job”—began Samuel and then hesitated. “I don\u0027t know how a professor comes to get his job,” he said. “But I suppose that the men who make the great fortunes—the ones who are wisest and best of all—they give the money for the colleges, don\u0027t they?” “Yes,” said Professor Stewart. “And then,” said Samuel, “I suppose it is they who have chosen you?” Again the professor darted a suspicious glance at his questioner. “Er—one might put it that way,” he said. “Well, then, that is your right to teach; and you could explain it. Then you could say to these men: \u0027There are too many of you; you aren\u0027t needed; and you must be removed.\u0027” But the professor only shook his head. “It wouldn\u0027t do,” he said. And Samuel, pondering and seeking as ever, came to a sudden comprehension. “I see,” he exclaimed. “What is needed is action!” “Action?” “Yes—it\u0027s for us who are beaten to teach it; and to teach it in our lives. It\u0027s a sort of revival that is needed, you see.” “But I don\u0027t see the need,” laughed the other, interested in spite of himself. “That\u0027s because you aren\u0027t one of us!” cried Samuel vehemently. “Nobody else can understand—nobody! It\u0027s easy to be one of the successes of life. You have a comfortable home and plenty to eat and all. But when you\u0027ve failed—when you\u0027re down and out—then you have to bear hunger and cold and sickness. And there is grief and fear and despair—you can have no idea of it! Why, I\u0027ve met a little girl in this town. She works in the cotton mill, and it\u0027s just killed her by inches, body and soul. And even so, she can only get half a day\u0027s work; and the mother is trying to support the little children by sewing—and they\u0027re all just dying of slow starvation. This very morning they asked me to stay to breakfast, and I refused, because I knew they had only some bread and a few potatoes, and it wasn\u0027t enough for one person. You see, it\u0027s so slow—it\u0027s such a terribly long process—this starving people off by inches. And keeping them always tormented by hope. Don\u0027t you see, Professor Stewart? And just because you don\u0027t come out honestly and teach them the truth. Because you won\u0027t say to them: \u0027The world is too full; and you\u0027ve got to get out of the way, so as to give us a chance.\u0027 Why, look, sir—you defeat your own purposes! These people stay, and they keep on having more children, and everything gets worse instead of better; and they have diseases and vices—they ruin the whole world. What\u0027s the use of having a world if it\u0027s got to be like this town—crowded with hovels full of dirty people, and sick people, and starving and miserable people? I can\u0027t see how you who live up here on the heights can enjoy yourselves while such things continue.” “Um—no,” said Professor Stewart; and he gazed at Samuel with knitted brows—unable, for the life of him, to feel certain whether he ought to feel amused, or to feel touched, or to feel outraged. As for Samuel, he realized that he was through with the professor. The professor had taught him all that he had to teach. He did not really understand this matter at all—that was because he belonged to the other world, the world of successful and fit people. They had their own problems to solve, no doubt! This non-comprehension was made quite clear by the professor\u0027s next remark. “I\u0027m sorry to have disappointed you,” he said. “If a little money will help you—” “No,” said the other quickly. “You mustn\u0027t offer me money. How can that be right? That would be charity.” “Ahem!” said the professor. “Yes. But then—you mentioned that you hadn\u0027t had any breakfast. Hadn\u0027t you better go into the kitchen and let them give you something?” “But what is the use of putting things off?” cried Samuel wildly. “If I\u0027m going to preach this new idea, I\u0027ve got to begin.” “But you can\u0027t preach very long on an empty stomach,” objected the other. To which Samuel answered, “The preaching has to be by deeds.” And so he took his departure; and Professor Stewart turned back to his work-table, upon which lay the bulky manuscript of his monumental work, which was entitled: “Methods of Relief; A Theory and a Programme.” Some pages lay before him; the top one was headed: “Chapter LXIII—Unemployment and Social Responsibility.” And Professor Stewart sat before this title, and stared, and stared.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3245/88930.html","bookId":642,"book":{"id":642,"title":"Samuel the Seeker","description":"简介： He had written these words upon the little picture of Samuel\u0027s mother, which hung in that corner of the old attic which served as the boy\u0027s bedroom; and so Samuel grew up with the knowledge that he, too, was one of the Seekers.
