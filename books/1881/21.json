He was so surprised at the unexpected sensual defiance that he didn\u0027t pull her away. Then it was too late. Shocking pleasure rocked his body. He clenched his hands in her hair, closed his eyes and wondered if his sweet little wife had expected what she got.\n He collapsed afterward, sprawling across the bed on his front,Taylorby his side. He was aware that she was stroking him, like he was some great big cat. He lay there and enjoyed the experience, glad that his loss of control hadn\u0027t revived her fear. When he finally managed to rouse himself, he turned his head and muttered, \"Sorry.\"\n She lowered her head until her lips brushed his. \"I am an intelligent woman you know. I knew what was\n ... coming.\"\n \"Did you...\" he croaked.\n She swallowed very deliberately. \"What do you think?\" There was mischief in her eyes and just a tinge of shyness. But, no doubt, his baby was coming out of her shell.\n His eyes went wide. \" Dio! I\u0027ve created a monster.\" Utterly delighted with her, he glanced at her little-nothing nightie. \"Why aren\u0027t you naked?\"\n \"Should I take it off?\" she asked, a blush heating up her cheeks.\n He just raised a brow at the silly question.\n Sitting up on her knees, she grabbed the fluttering hem and pulled the nightie off, leaving her clad only in a pair of tiny lace panties. He recognized them.\n \"You\u0027re wearing my present.\" Reaching out, he touched her between her legs. The material was damp.\n White-hot heat radiated from her core. She remained in her kneeling position, legsspread, letting him lazily explore .\n \"When are you going to give me another present?\"\n Despite her continued blush, the cheeky question was so sensuallyplayful, he could hardly believe it was asked by the same woman who\u0027d feared a simple kiss. \"What do you want, bellissima?\"\n Her eyes were wide and her breathing hitched. \"Use yourimagination, you\u0027re pretty good at it.\"\n Smiling smugly, he sped up his finger strokes, aware that despite her open desire, she continued to hold back part of herself. But each time they loved, that fear-inspired reserve lessened. Soon, soon he\u0027d have everything.\n \"Um ... oh ... more, please, please more.\"\n He gave her more, wanting to satisfy her because she\u0027d satisfied him so very well. A while later, when she was squirming, he pressed hard against the throbbing nubbin between her legs, then withdrew before she could crest.\n \"Jackson!\" Her glare was pure heat, her shyness lost under the pleasure and frustration.\n He chuckled, enjoying her feminine rage. \"You are so sexy. Come down here so I can kiss you.\"\n \"Lazy.\" But, she started to move down. While she was doing so, he rolled over onto his back. Putting his hand on her shapely little bottom, he said, \"Straddle my chest.\"\n Frowning at the order, she asked, \"Why?\"\n \"Do it and I\u0027ll showyou. \"\n Curious, she followed the instruction. \"Now what?\"\n \"Move up a little.\"\n Her eyes wide, she obeyed. And stopped. He told her to keep going. She did. And then, hardly breathing, she moved that final inch. Chuckling at her scandalized expression, he shifted aside the gusset of her panties and returned the favor she\u0027d done him. With interest.\n \"Jackson...\" she began to protest and he thought that he\u0027d gone too far for her.\n He licked one long, slow lick.\n She shuddered and clutched at the headboard.\n \"Wet and hot,\" he murmured, satisfied that she\u0027d let him have his way. \"Just the way I like my wife.\"\n She was whimpering with his first kiss and sobbing with his second. By the time he began the third, her body had started to ripple with waves of pleasure.\n They spent their last afternoon inFijiat the beach.Taylorlathered herself with sunscreen and coaxed Jacksonto let her smooth the cream over him, too. His body was vital in the sunshine, all golden muscle and strength against her fingertips.\n \"How about a swim?\" He looked over his shoulder to where she knelt behind him.\n Putting down the sunscreen, she thought over their earlier exertions. \"Not after that hike you talked me into this morning.\" Her complaint was without heat because seeing the tropically forested upper regions of the island had been worth the trek. \"I\u0027ll float, you swim.\"\n Chuckling, he rose to his feet and tugged her up. \"Sexy,\" he murmured, a teasing gleam in his eye.\n Taylorknew very well that her modestly cut one piece bathing suit was no such thing. \"Studly,\" she responded tongue in cheek, glancing at his board shorts.\n Only his sudden smile gave her a hint of what he was about to do. Laughing, she tried to dodge him but he scooped her up in his arms and ran deep into the water before throwing her giggling body in. She came up still smiling and drenched from head to toe. Scraping her hair off her face, she took one look at him standing there laughing at her and narrowed her eyes. Using both hands, she splashed a huge wave of water onto him.\n Dripping, he grinned. \"Is that a declaration of war, piccola?\"\n In response, she splashed him again. Giving a mock roar, he lunged after her. The ensuing water fight was the most fun thatTaylorhad had in years. She laughed so much that her stomach hurt and when Jacksondeclared himself the victor, she was too exhausted to dispute it.\n Dragging herself from the water, she collapsed on the fine white sand and sunbathed while her far too energetic husband struck out for a longer swim. As she watched his strong body cut through the water, she realized that she\u0027d never been as happy as she was at that moment. Simple joy suffused her entire body, as if particles of happiness were trapped in the tropical sunshine which gilded her skin.\n This was a memory she\u0027d always cherish, she thought with a drowsy smile, setting down to wait for her husband in the joyful sunshine.\n Coming back to real life the next day was a shock forTaylor. Especially since the first thing she saw was a large envelope from Lance\u0027s firm.Jacksonpeered over her shoulder as she picked it up from the pile of mail collected by their security people. Heart in her throat, she walked over to the big living room window.\n Jacksoncame to stand behind her, hands on her waist. \"It\u0027s postmarked a week and a half ago.\"\n \"It\u0027s been forwarded from my apartment.\" She tore it open and pulled out a letter and attached legal documents. \"He\u0027s filed for a priority date for the custody hearing ... oh my God, he\u0027s really claiming that I\u0027m an unfit guardian and Nick\u0027s in danger!\" Panic started to gather in her body.\n Jacksontook the papers from her, one arm still around her waist. \"Idiot.\" The single short and derisive comment calmed her at once. After a quick scan of the documents, he gave them to her to hold. Without further discussion, he picked up the phone and punched in Lance\u0027s number.\n \"Mr.Hegerty ,it\u0027s JacksonSantorini .\" A pause. \"I\u0027m fine. My wife isn\u0027t doing so well. It seems you\u0027ve filed a suit for custody of her brother.\" A longer pause.\n Taylorstood wide-eyed, wondering what was happening.Jacksonsounded very calm and collected but there was something faintly dangerous about his tone.\n \"I understand, Mr.Hegerty , but I take my wife\u0027s unhappiness very seriously. Do you understand?\" Now she knew what it was about his voice that disturbed her. He sounded exactly like a mobster - a cool, slick, dangerous mobster. Then he said, \"My family doesn\u0027t take it too well either.Santorinis lookafter their own .\"\n She just about collapsed at that ominous tone.\n \"Yes, you think that over. Call me within the next three days or we\u0027ll take measures of our own.\" He hung up.\n \"Your family? I thought you didn\u0027t really see them?\" She needed a moment to ground herself before she found out what was happening with Nick.\n He gave her a narrow-eyed look. \"Italians have big extended families. When I turned eighteen and was free to make my own choices, I went to live inItalywith my paternal grandparents and uncles, who had always kept in touch with me. They are my true famiglia . In fact, they are already pestering me to bring you and Nicolas for a visit.\"\n \"And they\u0027d be ... unhappy if I was?\" She swallowed. \"They\u0027re not ... um...\" How did she ask if they were part of the criminal underworld without offending her new husband?\n It looked likeJacksonwas smiling faintly. \"I might\u0027ve forgotten to mention that some of them aren\u0027t exactly upstanding citizens.\" He released her.\n She sat down on the window seat. \"I ... see. What did Lance say?\" She could only deal with one thing at a time. Her husband\u0027s underworld relatives would have to wait.\n \"He blustered, but I know the lawsuit will disappear soon. Then, if necessary, he will consent to the adoption.\"\n \"You sound very confident.\"\n \"I am. We\u0027ve already got legal motions in progress if he doesn\u0027t. Worse comes to worst, we\u0027ll just tie him in legal knots for years.\" He touched her cheek. \"Don\u0027t worry,Taylor. I\u0027ll keep my part of the bargain.\"\n His eyes turned almost black. \"Come, I need to claim you again.\"\n It was such an old-world way of speaking, such a masculine statement that she couldn\u0027t fight it, her body going soft and welcoming at the rich darkness of his tone. Something about his words disturbed her, though it was hard to hold the thought when he took her into his arms. Yes, they\u0027d made a bargain, but that wasn\u0027t the only reason she\u0027d married him. Then he decided to take her against the wall and all she could concentrate on was his big body, hot and hard and demanding.\n The next morning felt like the true start of her new life. Nick had arrived home about an hour after their return, and was now on his way to school. She\u0027d bitten her lip and letJacksonlead him away, because it was clear that Nick needed her husband to claim him publicly.\n \"Be good, cara . Call me if you need anything.\" Before leaving,Jacksonhad kissed her with lazy thoroughness, mimicking the far more erotic kiss with which he\u0027d woken her this morning. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/awaken-to-pleasure/page-21.html","bookId":1881,"book":{"id":1881,"title":"Awaken To Pleasure","description":"Storyline: \n \"WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO MARRYING ME?\" \n The proposal was as unexpected as her feelings for the man whose dark good looks rivaled an even darker past.
