Closing the distance between them, he put one hand on her hip. He\u0027d expected her to recoil but to his pleased shock, one fine-boned hand fluttered to rest on his bare chest. Heat engulfed his body but he ruthlessly caged the fire, aware of the fragility of her faith in his goodness. \"I don\u0027t want to talk about that right now.\" Her answer didn\u0027t satisfy him, but then she said, \"I wanted to talk to you about the phone call.\" He was placated by that evidence of her trust. For this night, it was enough. \"Who was on the other end?\" \"Why didn\u0027t you press for more information before?\" \"I figured I had no right to know.\" Her face was so solemn, so lovely in the frame of midnight-dark hair. He lovedTaylor\u0027s thick, curling mane. Dreams of the silky strands spread over his arm as she slept beside him had tormented him since their first meeting. \"Do I?\" Taylorknew what he was really asking. \"I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m ready to let you into my world.\" He was silent for a moment. \"Why?\" \"You\u0027re...\" How could she admit that she was scared of what he made her feel, what he made her ache for? \"You trust me, don\u0027t you?\" The answer came easily because he\u0027d always been far more than just her boss, no matter what she\u0027d tried to convince herself. \"I\u0027m here.\" And she wouldn\u0027t be if she didn\u0027t trust him on a deep, unshakable level. That trust was rooted in the knowledge that he\u0027d never coerce her to do anything against her will. Jacksonwas a protector. And she needed his protection from Lance. More importantly, Nick needed his protection. \"Nick is the most precious part of my world,\" she whispered, making a decision. \"I know.\" \"He\u0027s returning from camp in a couple of days,\" she told him. \"Do you want to come pick him up with me?\" \"Yes.\" Taylorfelt something change in their relationship at that moment. With her invitation, she\u0027d accepted Jackson\u0027s claim over her and made a claim of her own. But did she have any right to him when her whole being was wracked with fear over Lance\u0027s threats to take her brother away? \"You only ever speak of Nick.\" One big hand stroked her hair. Instead of fear at the intimacy, she felt a shy sense of pleasure because this was annoyingly protectiveJackson. \"Do you have no other family?\" \"Not in truth.\" \"Tell me what that means, piccola .\" It was a masculine demand disguised as a request. Taylorfound that she wanted to tell him. He\u0027d never been given any privacy with his life and it seemed only fair that be should know something of her as well. And the truth was, she needed to tell someone and aside fromJackson, who was there? The first words took time, but he didn\u0027t hurry her. Standing in the hallway with her toes digging into the carpet andJackson\u0027s heat surrounding her, she\u0027d never felt safer. He might want her, but he would never force her - she\u0027d stake her life on that. \"My mother brought us up, well, she brought me up anyway. She died when Nick was six.\" Keeping her voice steady was an effort. \"I was twenty and her death wasn\u0027t a surprise. She was an alcoholic.\" To her shock, right then,Jacksonpicked her up and walked into his bedroom. The only light came from the full moon outside. She remained absolutely silent as he pulled a blanket off the bed and then sat down in a window seat similar to others about the house. He slung the blanket around her shoulders and held her in his lap like she belonged to him, while he leaned against the wall. She sat up but his body surrounded her. Protected her. \"Why am I telling you?\" she asked, wondering how it was that she felt so safe with him. And whether she should be frightened at the reason behind the feeling. \"Because you obviously need to talk. Did that phone call have anything do with your brother?\" \"How...\" She gasped at his perception. \"It terrified you. You only react like that when Nick\u0027s hurt.\" Her nod was jerky. \"It was Nick\u0027s father, Lance.\" \"Your father?\" Her blood seemed to turn ice-cold. Taking a deep breath, she toldJacksonthe reason why Lance cared nothing if he destroyed her. \"He\u0027s not my father.\" Jacksonlooked down at the flat sound of Taylor\u0027s voice. \"What?\" The urge to wrap her up in his arms and press her against his chest was almost irresistible. He fought the urge because he needed to see her face. \"My mother, Helena, was pregnant by another man when she married Lance.\" She stared fixedly at the dark square of the bedroom doorway. \"My biological father was already married. He didn\u0027t want his mistress after she became pregnant and refused to get rid of me. She was destitute.\" \"That wasn\u0027t your fault.\" He was shocked at the self-recrimination in her tone. \"Lance never let her forget,\" she continued. \"Almost every week, he\u0027d say something to remind her that I wasn\u0027t his, that he\u0027d taken her in when she was \u0027knocked up.\u0027 He didn\u0027t even give me his name.\" Jacksonfelt his hands curl into fists but forced himself to remain silent, aware that she needed to talk. It humbled him that she trusted him enough to share something so painful. He\u0027d had no choice when his secrets had been ripped from him and used to sell newspapers, but he knew just how much courage it took to deliberately entrust another person with such private pain. \"And she never stopped reminding me that it was because of me that she was stuck with a man who beat her when he was bored, and ... and used her.\" Her slim shoulder shifted as she took a deep breath that hitched. \"While I was growing up, Lance used to disappear without explanation for weeks, and then return like nothing had happened. \"My mother used to wait for him, as if he\u0027d come back and rescue us from poverty. Then one time, he didn\u0027t come back. They divorced when Nick was barely two.\" She stopped speaking, staring down at her hands. Jacksonwanted to strangle her parents. Instead, he gave in to the urge to touch her and closed one of his hands over hers, not certain that she\u0027d tolerate any further contact while mired in the past. Her eyes were confused when she finally turned to look at him. \"Why did she love him for such a long time? Why did she? We both knew he had other women. Was she that grateful that he took her in when she was pregnant?\" Jacksoncould imagine her mother\u0027s befuddlement at this child of hers who was so without deceit, a child who wouldn\u0027t allow her to forget grim reality in useless illusions. \"She sounds like a woman who lost her way.\" \"Yes.\" Poignant sadness colored that acknowledgement. \"Where does Nick\u0027s father fit in?\" Fear clouded her gaze. \"Lance didn\u0027t return for him after our mother died. Even before her death, I was the one who took care of Nick. But now he\u0027s back.\" Encouraged by her lack of resistance to their linked fingers, he reached out with his free hand and stroked her hair off her face, shifting his body closer to hers at the same time. \"What exactly does he want?\" \"Nick.\" Pain devastated the pure blue of her eyes to a dull shade. \"I\u0027ll fight him \u0027till I have nothing left, but I\u0027m afraid. He\u0027s Nick\u0027s father. I\u0027m only his half sister.\" She leaned just a little into his stroking hand. He was pleased that she saw him as a source of strength. \"You\u0027ve raised him.\" \"You don\u0027t understand. Lance isn\u0027t some riffraff - he\u0027s rich. He always was, though he never gave us a cent. I suppose he married my mother because she was so very beautiful and he wanted her. But, then, he threw her away. He didn\u0027t care about Nick then.\" Desperation was apparent in her too-fast speech. \"He told me that he\u0027d remarried and had a stable home for his son. I think he only wants Nick because he can\u0027t have children with his new wife.\" She was shaking, as if with rage. \"I can\u0027t let that happen! Lance will hurt him. I saw him hit Nick when he was a baby!\" Releasing his hand, she clutched at his forearm. \"I saw him!\" Gently disengaging her fingers, he took a chance and wrapped his arms around her. After a momentary hesitation, she softened. \"You must not worry so, piccola . I am here.\" Her pain tore at him. \"How rich?\" \"He\u0027s a partner atHegerty Williams. He\u0027s theHegerty .\" She named a prominent law firm. \"He knows judges and psychiatrists. He said he\u0027d have me declared unfit if I didn\u0027t give him Nick, and that he\u0027s convinced judges who are friends of his that I have a bad lifestyle. \"I\u0027ve tried to fight it but all my motions to the court keep getting denied and his accepted. I\u0027ve fought every way I can but I don\u0027t know how much longer I can stall him. I\u0027m so scared. I can\u0027t lose Nick. I can\u0027t.\" Jacksonfelt his instincts growl in warning. How dare anyone threaten this woman? This strong, beautiful woman, who, unbeknownst to anyone, belonged to JacksonSantorini . He pulled back and tilted her face up with a finger under her chin, his anger intensifying when he saw that her eyes were shiny with tears she refused to shed. \"Do you trust me, Taylor?\" If she didn\u0027t, he was damn well going to teach her to, even if he had to cuddle her in his lap all night long. She nodded. \"Yes.\" Then she scowled. \"I don\u0027t think I should\u0027ve admitted that.\" He was pleased with her despite her dark expression. \"Then believe me when I say I\u0027ll help you.\" \"I\u0027m sorry to ask this of you. I know how people always want things from you. I don\u0027t want to be like them!\" Her frustration was clear. \"I know you don\u0027t think like that.\" He\u0027d always had to fight her pride to give her the smallest consideration. Stroking the cool smoothness of her cheek, he said, \"Come now, piccola . Where is my little tigress?\" Her full lips curved upward in a rueful smile. \"I think she\u0027s in hibernation.\" \"That\u0027s more like theTaylorI know.\" Without stopping to think, he pressed a hard kiss to her lips, withdrawing the instant he remembered what he\u0027d done. \"My apologies again...\" His gut twisted at the thought that he might\u0027ve broken her fledgling trust in him.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/awaken-to-pleasure/page-6.html","bookId":1881,"book":{"id":1881,"title":"Awaken To Pleasure","description":"Storyline: \"WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO MARRYING ME?\" The proposal was as unexpected as her feelings for the man whose dark good looks rivaled an even darker past.
