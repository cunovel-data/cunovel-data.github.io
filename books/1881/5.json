No one can see inside, even if they get into the grounds.\"\n Next to him,Taylor\u0027s profile was clean and pure. The curling hair around her face looked like it would be incredibly soft to the touch. The urge to reach out and test his theory was so strong that he shoved his hands into his pants pockets and clenched them tight.\n \"Your home\u0027s very tidy.\"\n To him, it looked barren. \"I don\u0027t live with a kid.\"\n She smiled fondly. \"He is a tad messy but I suppose muddy sneakers come with little boys.\"\n \"I\u0027m surprised you let him go on the camp.\"\n Her eyes moved from contemplating the turbulent sea to fix on his face. \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\"\n He raised a brow. \"You\u0027re very protective of Nick.\"\n \"I\u0027m his only family.\" Her defensiveness was clear. \"I can be protective if I want.\"\n He left the topic for now, aware how touchy she was about her brother. He\u0027d tried to broach the subject with her while she\u0027d worked for him, but she\u0027d frozen him out. At the time, he\u0027d been frustrated at having to accept that he didn\u0027t have any rights over her brother ... or over her.\n Yet.\n He wouldn\u0027t touch her tonight, because he\u0027d promised her safety and he would never renege on that assurance. But, after tonight, all bets were off, because he wanted rights overTaylor. All sorts of rights.\n Chapter 3\n \" One of the spare rooms is made up. It\u0027s to the right of the upstairs bathroom. My bedroom\u0027s across the hall if you need anything.\"Jackson\u0027s tone was businesslike.\n Taylorknew a dismissal when she heard one. \"Yes, boss.\" She looked from the tumultuous weather outside to the powerful man standing next to her. He could be just as dangerous as the storm winds.\n \"I certainly never heard that when you were working for me.\" His words were light but the look in his eyes was intensity itself, hot and possessive.\n She knew what that look meant and had from a very early age. She just didn\u0027t want to deal with it. Heart thudding, she said an abrupt \"Good night,\" and left.\n There was no lock on the bedroom door but she didn\u0027t worry.Jacksonwould never assault her. That didn\u0027t mean he didn\u0027t want her. In the past, when life had threatened to become too bleak or lonely, she\u0027d hugged the awareness of his desire to her, safe in the knowledge that nothing would ever come of it. She wasn\u0027t that kind of woman.\n AndJacksonwasn\u0027t that kind of man. His personal code was stronger than lust or passion. He wouldn\u0027t have broken his wedding vows no matter what Bonnie had done. But now his wife was gone and he\u0027d acknowledged the smoldering fire between them, if only with his dark eyes.\n Confused by her warring emotions,Taylorstarted to get ready for bed and then realized she had nothing to sleep in. About to search the closet in the room, she heard a heavy tread outside her door. A curt knock followed.\n Opening the door, she foundJacksonholding out a white shirt. \"Thought you might need this.\" His voice was low and that banked fire in his gaze wasn\u0027t apparent.\n Her heart turned over. \"Thanks.\" Just as she took the shirt, her cell phone, which she\u0027d dropped into the pocket of her robe, rang. Immediately, worry shot through her. \"That might be Nick. Hold on.\"\n Unfortunately, it was her stepfather. LanceHegerty , on the line. \"Where are you,Taylor? No one\u0027s answering at your place. \"Where\u0027s my son?\"\n She knew he\u0027d said the last deliberately - a cruel reminder that Nick was only her half brother. No matter that she\u0027d raised him, in the eyes of the law she had less of a right to Nick than Lance, his biological father.\n \"Why are you calling? It\u0027s late.\" Her voice threatened to tremble. She crushed the shirt in her hand.\n \"You haven\u0027t responded yet.\"\n She knew her face was losing its color. Turning her back toJackson, she said, \"I have two more weeks.\"\n A bare fourteen days before time expired to file legal papers in opposition to his claim for sole custody.\n His laugh was cruel. \"We can do it easy or we can do it hard but I\u0027ll win. Remember that and don\u0027t forget your place, brat - you\u0027re nothing but a rich man\u0027s castoff. My son deserves better than a life with you.\"\n She hung up, hand shaking. Lance could reduce her to tears with a few well-chosen barbs, but she prided herself on never breaking down where he could see or hear her.\n \"Who was that?\"Jacksondemanded.\n She could almost feel the heat of his big body against her back. The urge to tell him was overwhelming, but remnants of the fear generated by the call held her back.Jacksonwas a rich and powerful man, too.\n He might take Lance\u0027s side. Bewildered and a little lost, she could barely think. All she knew was that she couldn\u0027t let that monster take Nick. Suddenly, panic hit her. What if Lance took him by force? She had to call the camp and warn them!\n When she turned to faceJackson, the clean, male scent of him taunted her with promises of safety.\n \"Someone I don\u0027t want to talk to,\" she admitted, trying not to let him see the panic riding her.\n \"Do you want me to deal with it?\"\n She shook her head. \"No. I think I\u0027d like to go to sleep.\" Her words were blunt, her inner resources depleted by the force of her apprehension.\n Though his dark eyes narrowed, he left, his shoulders almost filling the doorway. Despite the horrible feeling in the pit of her stomach, the urge to touch those shoulders made her throat dry. Big, strong Jacksonseemed like the safest port in the storm of her life.\n Trembling, she closed her door and immediately called Nick\u0027s camp counselor. After waking her from a deep sleep, she made the poor woman do a bed check on her brother and then swear that she\u0027d ensure that no one butTaylorwas allowed to pick him up, during or after camp. She wanted to go get him right now, but Nick had been so excited about the camp, she couldn\u0027t bear to cut it short.\n Calmer now that she knew he was safe, she got out of the robe and into the shirt. It came almost to her knees and she had to fold back the cuffs several times before her hands poked through the sleeves. But, for some reason she didn\u0027t want to face, it comforted her to be wearingJackson\u0027s shirt. She crawled into bed, craving sleep.\n Instead, fear hammered at her temples, creating an excruciating headache. Whimpering in pain, she sat up, aware that her suffering was stress induced. She needed to release some of the pressure by asking for help - by askingJackson? Out of the grip of the illogical terror that had bewildered her after the call, she knew that her fears that he\u0027d take Lance\u0027s side were groundless. JacksonSantorini might be dictatorial and dominating, but unlike her tormentor, he had honor.\n Life had forced her to be strong, but this time there were so many burdens on her that she felt as if she would collapse. Despite that, her heart rebelled against askingJackson. She remembered how his family ignored him, except when they needed his help. Becoming another burden chafed, but she\u0027d do anything to protect Nick. Including asking the help of a man who made her wish for impossible things.\n Afraid that her courage would desert her if she delayed, she jumped out of bed. It was only when she was standing beforeJackson\u0027s bedroom door that she remembered her only clothing was his shirt. Her knuckles had hit the wood by then and it was too late. The door swung open before she could retreat.\n Jacksonstood in front of her, wearing a pair of white boxer shorts.\n Captivated by the view, she lost her train of thought. His thickly muscled wall of a chest, covered with a sprinkling of black hair, was only the start. Ropes of muscle ran across his shoulders and arms, and his abdomen was ridged in a way that told her he carried no excess flesh. His thighs looked like tree trunks.\n She\u0027d been right - the man was muscled everywhere.\n He shifted and she jerked her head up, aware that she\u0027d been staring. But, how could any red-blooded woman resist indulging herself with such a prime example of masculinity? Especially a woman who\u0027d been shown time and time again that this masculine power would never be turned against her. She expected to see amusement in those dark eyes, but something else awaited her.\n Desire.\n Hot, rippling desire.\n Scorching desire.\n She was familiar with desire - Jacksoninspired dreams of such erotic power they left her drenched in sweat. But she was even more familiar with desire in men\u0027s eyes. After she\u0027d turned fourteen, her mother\u0027s boyfriends had looked at her with eyes hot with wanting. Then there had been that ... she didn\u0027t like to think about that much. It still made her feel dirty and used.\n \"Cara.\"Jackson\u0027s husky whisper sent shivers racing through her, but she couldn\u0027t move away.\n He tipped up her face with a finger under her chin and then bent down to press his lips gently against hers. Instinctive defense mechanisms kicked into place and she stood still, not fighting but not responding either. Frustration gnawed at her stomach as she realized that despite her age and knowledge ofJackson, childhood terrors still had a stranglehold over her.\n He broke the kiss. \"My apologies. I did not realize that you did not accept my kiss.\"\n So formal, she thought, so icy, when his lips had been warm and soft. She felt suddenly bereft but knew it was her own fault - the fruit of cowardice. \"I accepted.\"\n He braced his right hand on the doorjamb, his face expressionless in a way she hated. \"Like a statue. I won\u0027t touch you again if that is what you prefer.\"\n That option didn\u0027t sound good to her. Nibbling on her lower lip, she looked down at the lush grey carpet and then backup. \"I don\u0027t deal well with men wanting me.\" While she didn\u0027t trustJackson\u0027s desire, she trusted his intellect. He would never judge her for her fear, not when he\u0027d been hurt so much by others. \"I\n ... had some bad experiences when I was younger.\" She hadn\u0027t meant to admit that much but couldn\u0027t bringherself to regret the confidence. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/awaken-to-pleasure/page-5.html","bookId":1881,"book":{"id":1881,"title":"Awaken To Pleasure","description":"Storyline: \n \"WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO MARRYING ME?\" \n The proposal was as unexpected as her feelings for the man whose dark good looks rivaled an even darker past.
