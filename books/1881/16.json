The thought ofJackson\u0027s hands on her didn\u0027t scare her, but it had taken Maggie to make her realize the depth of trust she had in him. \"What are you afraid of?\" Maggie had asked earlier that day, deep into the long-distance session. She\u0027d remembered being pushed against the door in the basement, of the hand over her mouth in that park. \"Pain, humiliation ... of having my trust broken again.\" \"Oh, soJacksonhurts you? Debases you?\" \"No! How dare you say that?\" she\u0027d yelled, furious. \"If I\u0027m so wrong,\" Maggie had paused, \"then what are you really afraid of?\" It had taken her long minutes to answer. \"My own cowardice. What if I can\u0027t be what he needs?\" \"What if you can? Take one step and find out.\" One step. Like havingJackson\u0027s hands all over her. It was a distinctly tantalizing image after the way she\u0027d run her own hands all over him and received such pleasure. Her eyes widened as she slipped out of the dress. In the mirror, her breasts were almost quivering with desire. Oh, yes, the thought of having her husband\u0027s hands all over her wasn\u0027t a reason against buying this dress. The party wasn\u0027t as harrowing as she\u0027d feared. Though she\u0027d worked hard to climb out from under Lance\u0027s shadow, sometimes his barbs about her worth returned to haunt her. But, it appeared that her panic had been for naught. True to his word,Jacksonwas by her side throughout the night and once it became clear that she was very much his, people treated her with a sort of cautious pleasantness. Taylorhad to hide her smile. She\u0027d never inspired fear in anyone, but her dark and very Italian husband certainly did. She approved. In this world, he needed every advantage. It was enough for his wife to know that he wasn\u0027t a man who would hurt those he\u0027d sworn to protect. No one else needed to be aware of his tenderness. The only sour point came toward the end of the evening. A buxom blonde sidled up toJackson, as if Taylorweren\u0027t held firmly by his side, his big hand flat on her lower back. As she\u0027d guessed, he hadn\u0027t stopped touching her for more than a few seconds at a time. On occasion, he\u0027d move his thumb in an idle movement and her breath would catch while the bottom fell out of her stomach. The heat of him was enticing enough but when he moved his hand ... she wanted to beg him to move a little lower. Oh yes, havingJackson\u0027s hands all over her was becoming more and more intriguing. Especially if he touched her whole body the way he\u0027d touched her back tonight. No pain, extreme possessiveness and a hot, wanting look in his eyes. She had the feeling that if she\u0027d been an ordinary woman with no hang-ups, they\u0027d have either arrived at the party very late or not at all. The minute she\u0027d walked out of her room, his face had tensed and he\u0027d growled at her to get her \"little butt back in there\" and change out of that \"excuse for a dress.\" Of course she hadn\u0027t, but with any other woman she knewJacksonwould\u0027ve probably won the fight by the simple expedient of tearing off the dress, and keeping her in bed until it was too late to make an appearance. The primitive desire that had glittered in his eyes when he first saw her had been an explicit indication of exactly what he wanted to do to her. If they did end up making love, she\u0027d have to watch his tendency to take over her life and she had no illusions that he wouldn\u0027t try. That was the man he was, difficult to handle, almost impossible to fight, but perhaps, she thought with feminine insight, he could be coaxed, gentled. And if he did allow her to tame him, even just a little, didn\u0027t that mean she had some power in the marriage? Being with him was very definitely a partnership - he expected her to match him. TrustingJacksonwith her body became an even more attractive option when she understood the dynamic of their relationship, so attractive that she was involved in a heated daydream about her big husband and her naked body, when the top-heavy blonde sashayed over. \"JacksonSantorini ! I thought it was you.\" The twit made the mistake of laying a hand onJackson\u0027s sleeve. Eyes narrowed,Taylorreached out and brushed the woman\u0027s hand off. \"Oops. I think my husband had some ... dirt, on his sleeve. You really should watch that, darling.\" She glanced up at him, a warning in her eyes. He was trying not to grin. \"Thank you, mia moglie .\" The sensual glint in his eye told her that he was pleased at her little show of jealousy. She didn\u0027t care. Forget anything she\u0027d ever said about allowing him a mistress. If he touched another woman, she\u0027d gut them both. \"Do I know you?\"JacksonhuggedTaylorto his side, soothing her with his obvious display of ownership. A spark of anger appeared in the blonde\u0027s eyes. \"BelleBouvier . We met at the Vanderbilt party last spring.\" \"Apologies, Belle. You look a little different.\" \"Oh.\" The twit dimpled, apparently forgiving him. \"I remember! I\u0027d dyed my hair black! Can you imagine?\" \"Well, I did see you when it was black.\" Taylorcould tell that he was fighting the urge to burst out laughing. \"Hello, Belle. I\u0027mTaylor.\" \"Nice to meet you.\" The poisonous look in her eyes said otherwise. \"I just wanted to congratulate Jackson.\" \"For what?\"Jacksonasked. \"My sources tell me that you\u0027ve just been voted Glitter magazine\u0027s sexiest bachelor of the year.\" \"No longer a bachelor.\" He looked down at Taylor, who was fuming. \"Thank you, Belle, but you\u0027ll have to excuse me. I believe our hostess is signaling us.\" As they walked,Taylormuttered, \"Bouvier, my foot.\" Jacksonsnickered, hugging her to him. It appeared that whileTaylorcould talk about him keeping a mistress, reality was another matter. He had a possessive little wife on his hands. Life had just become a lot more interesting. \"Stage name, I would guess.\" He moved his hand on the smooth skin of her back, coaxing her back into a good mood. Not that he minded the reason for her temper. He was confident enough of his masculinity to enjoy being considered her personal property. She made a little feminine noise but before she could respond to his physical cajoling, a man slithered to a stop in front of them. Henry Carey.Jacksondetested the man. It seemed their night for meeting unwelcome acquaintances. \"Santorini.\" \"Carey.\" He huggedTaylorcloser to him. She complied, a sleek, giving woman who fitted her bodyto his. \"Congratulations on your marriage.\" \"Word travels fast.\" \"You know how it is.\" Henry smirked and turned toTaylor. \"So, it must be ... interesting, being married to a man of your husband\u0027s size ... and strength.\" The insinuation was clear. The papers had had a field day afterBonnie\u0027s suicide, usingJackson\u0027s face and image to hint at violence and pain. He usually ignored Henry, finding him pitiful, but tonight his pride rebelled againstTaylorhearing the lies about him. If she heard them often enough, maybe she\u0027d start to believe, maybe she\u0027d start to fear him. He could bear anything but that. About to move toward Carey, he was stopped by his wife, who stepped protectively in front of him. \"Why you odious little man ,\"Taylorsaid, her voice hard but low. \"My husband is a better man than you\u0027ll ever be, you weedy, pompous creature. I bet you don\u0027t even know what to do with a woman ... when you can get some female drunk enough to cooperate.\" Jacksoncouldn\u0027t believeTaylorwas defending him and insulting Henry, and doing it well. The other man wasn\u0027t used to trading barbs with a smart woman who didn\u0027t consider herself bound by the rules of their impolite society, which deemed that nothing must ever be said with blunt force, only covertly implied. \"How dare you...\" Henry began, mouth pinched. \"Oh, go away.\" She flicked her hand in a dismissive gesture. \"You annoy me. And if I ever hear you say anything against my husband, I\u0027ll tell everyone exactly how you got the funding for your last miserable picture.\" Henry\u0027s face paled. \"How do you know?\" Jacksonwas fascinated. Absolutely and utterly. He stood behind his wife, one hand curved around her body to lie on her stomach, not interfering. Delighted amazement kept him from taking over. No one had ever stood up for him. Not a single person. He was stunned at the feeling that spread through him at seeingTaylor\u0027s protectiveness. She raised a brow. \"You really should be more discreet. Now, leave.\" It was a regal order. Henry left, looking atTaylorwith more fear in his eyes than he\u0027d ever shownJackson. \"Piccola?\" \"Yes.\" She was scowling at Henry\u0027s retreating back, her arms folded like some avenging warrior-goddess. \"What do you know?\" \"Secretaries hear everything. I keep in touch with my friends in the movie business. Let\u0027s just say that Henry participated in a casting couch ... in reverse.\" \"But, who\u0027d want Henry?\" He was flabbergasted. \"Exactly what I said.\" Chapter 8 Jacksonhad just started unbuttoning the formal black shirt he\u0027d worn to the party, having eschewed any kind of jacket because of the heat, whenTaylorwandered in from across the hall. She had her face scrunched up in concentration and her hands on the clasp of her necklace. \"Darling, can you...\" She turned her back to him and swept aside her hair to bare her nape, creamy white against the electric blue of the dress. He walked over, hands aching to touch her. \"Darling,\" she\u0027d called him, like they were a normal couple. Tonight had been an education, exposing bothTaylor\u0027s possessiveness and her protectiveness. But, the fact was, they weren\u0027t a normal couple and despite those delightful revelations, he was strung taut with desire for his sweet, sexy wife. He undid the clasp without speaking, afraid he\u0027d give away his frustration if he opened his mouth. Her damn dress was a husband\u0027s nightmare. He\u0027d had to have a hand on her throughout the evening to warn off the predators. A lot of the men had had a look in their eyes that said they were just waiting until he was distracted, before they pounced. He hadn\u0027t being distracted by anything other than the feel of his wife\u0027s sleek body under his palm. She\u0027d seemed perfectly happy to let him stake his claim so publicly, not that he\u0027d given her much choice.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/awaken-to-pleasure/page-16.html","bookId":1881,"book":{"id":1881,"title":"Awaken To Pleasure","description":"Storyline: \"WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO MARRYING ME?\" The proposal was as unexpected as her feelings for the man whose dark good looks rivaled an even darker past.
