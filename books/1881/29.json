He would never lie to his wife. Tears threatened. He loved her. Her husband, the man she\u0027d adored from afar for so long, loved her. She had done well out of their bargain.\n What had her husband gained?\n A wife who loved his touch and a child who worshipped him. It seemed like a fair trade but it wasn\u0027t.\n Not when she was keeping her feelings locked up behind a wall of practicality and sense, too scared to trust someone with that final piece of her heart in case they abandoned her.\n She\u0027d marriedJacksonbecause he could keep Nick safe. But, what did she feel for him? She knew that she wouldn\u0027t be able to function if she lost Nick. Mouth dry, she asked herself the question she\u0027d been avoiding, afraid of the answer - what would happen to her if she lostJackson? Her mind went black with pain so intense it was unbearable.\n And she knew.\n If she lostJackson, a piece of her soul would die and even Nick wouldn\u0027t be able to reach her. With his tenderness and protective possessiveness, her husband had become forever a part of her. Now, all she had to do was show him that truth. He wouldn\u0027t believe her confession easily, this man who\u0027d been betrayed so publicly. He might think that she felt she had to respond to his declaration, or that she was grateful. Or even that she was emotional after the past week and a half.\n And yes, she was emotional, but not in that way. His care of her since they\u0027d lost their baby had opened her eyes to the strength and loyalty inside of her big Italian husband. He would never stop loving her, not even if she failed to keep her part of their bargain. Most importantly, he would never abandon her, consigning her to an emotional wasteland. That certainty made her secure enough to tell him that he was the most treasured part of her life.\n ConvincingJacksonthat she loved him without reservation or fear would take determination. But, he was going to believe her because he was hers for life. For the first time since her miscarriage, she felt true joy, knowing that other babies would grow from their precious relationship.\n Jacksonfound himself walking up the steps to their home barely after two that day. Though he\u0027d intended to stay away until at least five, givingTaylorspace, his protective instincts had refused to stop clamoring for a look at her. He even had an excuse prepared for why he was home, though it made him feel about ten years old.\n The door opened before he could reach it. A softly smilingTaylorstood there, arms folded across her chest. \"Now, how did I know you\u0027d be back early?\"\n Her teasing question released the tension across his shoulders. He\u0027d been afraid that she\u0027d find his protectiveness overbearing, when it was anything but that. She was so important to him that he couldn\u0027t bear to see her hurting. \"No kiss for your husband, mia moglie ?\" Reaching her, he leaned down.\n She met him more than halfway, her lips a whisper against his, a welcome home that he\u0027d been starving for.\"Hello, mio marito .And yes, I\u0027m okay.\"\n Loving her for understanding his need to care, he hugged her around the waist and nuzzled his face into her neck. \"I promise I\u0027ll leave you in peace for the rest of the day. I just came to get a kiss.\"\n She chuckled. When he pulled back, to his surprise, she took his hand and tugged him inside the house.\n He went, more than happy to accommodate her. She led him to the kitchen, where two cakes sat cooling. After sitting him down, she made coffee and then cut him a slice of cake. When he reached to take the saucer it was on, she shook her head and came around to sit on the chair facing him. Then, putting a bite of cake on her fork, she held it out, a smile in her eyes. Grinning, he let her feed him, something taut in his heart soothed by this sign of her healing.\n \"Jackson?\"\n \"Hmm?\" He accepted another mouthful.\n \"I did some thinking this morning.\"\n He looked up at the sound of her voice. The expression she was wearing made him refuse the next bite she offered. He wanted his mouth free to fight for her if he had to, because there was such purpose in that look that it shook him. \"And what did you think about?\"\n \"Loving,\" she murmured, putting the saucer and fork on the table. \"And how it\u0027s the greatest trust a woman can give to a man.\"\n His heart jumped. \"Why were you thinking of it?\"\n Her smile rivaled the sunshine. \"I was thinking that I love you so much it almost hurts, but that you might not believe me if I just said it, so I was trying to think of some brilliant declaration.\"\n Joy shot through every vein in his body, hot and potent and blinding. Rising to his feet, he hauled her up and crushed her to him. \"I believe you.\"\n \"Are you sure? I don\u0027t want a grumpy husband with doubts about why I\u0027m his wife.\"\n He let the conviction in her wash over him, her sharp words a dare to disbelieve. \"I know you\u0027re not a woman to say those words lightly. I know you.\" Lifting her up, he kissed her full on the lips, finding her more than ready, more than willing. When they finally parted, he slid her softly down his body.\n Blue, blue eyes met his as she raised her head. \"Sometimes, I look at you and my heart feels like it\u0027ll explode with the intensity of what you do to me.\" Her voice shook. \"Loving you should terrify me but you know what?\"\n Touched by her utter honesty and raw from the emotions rioting through him, he could barely speak.\n \"Tell me.\"\n \"All I feel is this overwhelming sense of rightness.\" Her heart was in her eyes. \"You were meant to be mine.\"\n A lifetime of loneliness disappeared in the brilliant truth of her claiming. \"And you, mine. I will never let you go, mia moglie e bellissima .\" His beautiful wife. His .\n \"Thank God.\" Then scowling, she muttered, \"Not that you\u0027d get very far if you tried to walk away, JacksonSantorini . I keep what\u0027s mine.\"\n Her tart tone made him grin.\"Tivogliobene .\"\n \"You can\u0027t fool me - I know that one.\" Her kiss was a mix of fire and sweet tenderness. \"And, I love you, too.\"\n Epilogue\n Jacksonhadn\u0027t thought that life could get any better but to his delight, it did. Not only was sweet, sexy Taylor his wife, she was now his lover in the most complete sense of the word. He didn\u0027t have a single doubt about her feelings - after all, his wife didn\u0027t tell lies. And that wife said she loved him so regularly that the Italian in him was coming to expect her adoration as his due.\n One night, as she was straddling his back, torturing him with her hands and mouth, as she did on a regular basis, she said, \" Honey, Nick kind of wants a niece or nephew soon.\"\n He frowned. \"I told you, we\u0027re waiting until you\u0027re perfectly recovered.\"\n \"It\u0027s been ten months.\" He could tell she was pouting. She kissed his shoulder. \"Please, darling.\"\n \"Three more months.\" He reached back and stroked her calf. She bit him on his bicep. \"Bad-tempered little witch.\"\n \"One month.\" She was pressing her naked body along the length of his, knowing full well it drove him crazy. It was only fair, given that his body turned her mindless with lust. He smirked against the pillow.\n \"Two.\"\n \"One and a half.\" She was stroking his flanks now. \"Please. Please, please, please!\"\n He laughed at her begging because they both knew that she\u0027d get her own way. Turning, he flipped her under him. \"One and a half but...\" he scowled at her, \"only if the doctor gives his okay.\"\n She made a face. \"Fine. How many children did you want again? One?\" Her gentle laughter at his expense had only become worse after she\u0027d declared her love.\n His delight in her grew with every moment. \"I always thought five children was a good number.\" He pressed his arousal into the pool of heat between her legs.\n \"Five babies? You expect me to give birth five times?\" She didn\u0027t look too impressed.\n \"No. Only four. I already have a son.\"\n IfTaylorhadn\u0027t loved him rather madly by then, that casual acceptance of Nick as his son would have done it. \"Let me up, I haven\u0027t finished touching your back.\"\n He ground his erection against her body. \"Later. I want to take you now.\"\n \"You can\u0027t just take over. It was my turn!\" she protested. He had a tendency to become incredibly dominating if she didn\u0027t keep her eye on him.\n He started to slide in with an expression of almost painful pleasure. \"Are you going to make me leave?\"\n \"Later.\" There was something to be said for a dominant Italian husband in bed. \"Did you get bigger?\"\n \"No. You got tighter, piccola . Probably because you exercise those muscles all the time.\" He was chuckling.\n She wrapped her arms and legs firmly around him and squeezed those internal muscles in retaliation.\n \"Like I do it on my own, Mr. Three Times a Day.\"\n \"I\u0027ll get slower as I get older.\" He groaned.\n \"It seems like you\u0027re only getting more demanding.\" She arched up. \"Ooooh. Deeper. Deeper!\"\n Rain splattered against the skylight asJackson\u0027s body started driving into hers.Taylorsmiled and thanked the heavens for rainy nights, before her husband demanded her complete attention.\n Eleven months later, Nick got his wish. Josef ReidSantorini was a little small to play soccer, butJackson assured the older boy that that would change. When Nick was scared to hold Josef, it was Jackson who gave him courage, standing by his side. His love for both his boys was apparent in the shining light in his dark eyes.\n \"I kinda get whyTaylor\u0027s so protective of me. Do you think I used to be so little?\" Nick smiled down at the baby, already showing the same protective tendencies in his careful grasp.\n Jacksonchuckled. \"We\u0027ll have to ask her. Don\u0027t worry, he\u0027s aSantorini like you and we\u0027re indestructible.\"\n From the nursery doorway,Taylorwatched her men laugh and felt blessed. WhenJacksonturned to her and said, \" Cara, \" she walked over. \"You\u0027re heavily outnumbered now,\" he whispered to her, while Nick was occupied with Josef. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/awaken-to-pleasure/page-29.html","bookId":1881,"book":{"id":1881,"title":"Awaken To Pleasure","description":"Storyline: \n \"WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO MARRYING ME?\" \n The proposal was as unexpected as her feelings for the man whose dark good looks rivaled an even darker past.
