Or what you say, for that matter.” Taz practically spat the words at him.\\n\\n Kyle slid off him and sat on the bed beside him, still gazing down at him.\\n\\n “So you have no interest in having me come back to be your nobyo?”\\n\\n He was silent so long Kyle didn’t think he was going to answer. Finally he growled out an angry reply. “You left me. You left our child.”\\n\\n “Technically, I only left you. The baby hadn’t arrived yet.”\\n\\n Taz glared at him and then turned his head away, his body language making it clear he wasn’t going to dignify that with an answer.\\n\\n “If you don’t want me to be your nobyo, I can still let you go. I haven’t claimed you, you see. So while I’d be sad, and it would take me a long, long time to get over you, I might still be able to do it. Find another mate. If that’s what you want.”\\n\\n He glanced over at Kyle with a bitter, angry expression. “You just can’t help yourself, can you? You want someone else? I heard you were seen in bars with other men.”\\n\\n “Oh, that got back to you, huh? Lucas said it would. What would you think if I said yes, I would like someone else who treated me more like an equal?” Kyle asked, tilting his head.\\n\\n “I’d think you were a whore! And I’d be right. You belonged to me. And you were very well treated!” Taz pressed his lips together bitterly and cast an accusing glance at Kyle.\\n\\n “Well, you don’t want me anymore. What difference does it make to you? And in my culture, I wasn’t cheating on you at all. I haven’t properly mated with you yet.”\\n\\n “I’ve mated you, as you say, in every possible way.”\\n\\n “But I haven’t mated you. That’s what forms our bond. That and the bite.”\\n\\n “What do you mean?”\\n\\n “Once I make love to you and give you the mating bite, then I would never be able to leave you—never be able to be away from you or ever want another man.”\\n\\n Kyle saw Taz listening carefully, but he still kept his face turned away. Sighing heavily, Kyle got up to leave. “I’ll have someone come in and release you, and send you back to Tygeria.”\\n\\n He got as far as the door before Taz spoke again. “I guess it wouldn’t be so bad, this mating thing. If that’s what you need to keep you from being a whore.”\\n\\n Stopping with his hand on the door, Kyle smiled a little before he turned back around. “You’re a sweet talker, I’ll give you that.” He took a step closer to the bed. “So are you saying you’d like me to give you the mating bite? You want me to make love to you?”\\n\\n “If that’s what it takes to get you to come back home where you belong…and take over your responsibilities. I guess I could make that sacrifice. The baby needs a nobyo, I suppose.”\\n\\n “What about you? Do you want me to be your nobyo?” Kyle asked softly.\\n\\n Taz rolled his eyes. “Isn’t that what I just said?”\\n\\n Kyle sat down on the bed beside him again. He took a key from his pocket and released Taz from the cuffs. He leaned over and kissed his forehead, his cheeks, his lips. Taz squirmed under his attention, and put a hand on his chest to push him gently away.\\n\\n “Stop—I don’t like it.”\\n\\n Kyle wrapped a hand around his rapidly filling cock. “Really?”\\n\\n Taz ignored him. “Well, how do we do this? Let’s get on with it.”\\n\\n “Lie down—face down.” Kyle took his shoulder and urged him to turn over in bed. Grumbling, he moved to his stomach and rose on one hand to look over his shoulder at Kyle, but Kyle pushed him back down. “No, just relax. Stay down.”\\n\\n Taz let out a long, put-upon breath, but did as he asked and turned back around, holding himself up on his elbows. “Hurry this up, will you?”\\n\\n Kyle smiled and took off his pants with hands that trembled with desire. He didn’t want Taz to see how much he wanted this, and he didn’t trust his voice right now. He shoved his pants and underwear down and stepped out of them, went to the small table beside his bed, and pulled out a small bottle of oil. He drizzled the cool, slippery liquid onto his hand and down between Taz’s ass cheeks, stopping for a moment to admire the rounded ass. He massaged the lube into the crease, finding Taz’s hole and enjoyed the needy little sounds coming from Taz’s throat, the ones he was trying so hard to hold back.\\n\\n “Like that?” Kyle dipped a well-lubed finger inside. “Does that feel good?”\\n\\n Taz’s back stiffened, but his breathing rate had increased noticeably. He nodded, keeping his face turned away. Kyle couldn’t resist smacking his bottom. Taz jumped and cast an angry glare back at him.\\n\\n “Such a beautiful ass,” he murmured appreciatively, and Taz shrugged a bit.\\n\\n “Of course,” he said, immodestly. “Tygerians have the most beautiful bodies of any species in the galaxies.”\\n\\n “Prettier than mine?” Kyle teased.\\n\\n At first Kyle thought he wasn’t going to answer, but he finally lifted one shoulder again. “Yours is quite—nice—for a Lycan.”\\n\\n Grinning, Kyle added another finger and pumped in and out, twisting every few strokes and ignoring the squirming Taz began doing. Putting one hand down on the small of his back to keep him still, he searched gently with his fingers until he found what he was looking for, rubbing his fingers hard over the spot. Taz cried out and almost came off the bed. It was all Kyle could do to keep him on it.\\n\\n “What was that? What did you do to me?”\\n\\n “That’s the spot inside you that makes the pain worth it. Don’t tell me you never felt that before. You showed it to me.”\\n\\n “No,” he replied sullenly. “How would I know how it felt?”\\n\\n “But didn’t you ever…”\\n\\n “No,” he said firmly. “I knew it was there, but that’s for nobyos.”\\n\\n “See what you’ve been missing?”\\n\\n Taz’s eyes widened a bit and he slowly nodded. “It might have its merits. Perhaps when you come back home where you belong, I may allow you to touch me there again with your fingers. Now are we finished?”\\n\\n Kyle grinned. “Not by a long shot, baby. Get up on your knees.”\\n\\n Grumbling, Taz rose to his knees and patiently moved his legs apart. “Get on with this, Nobyo. I grow weary of it.”\\n\\n Kyle noticed the name he called him, and thrilled to hear it again, but he said nothing. Instead, he moved up to kneel behind him and poised the head of his cock against Taz’s hole. “Ready, baby?” Kyle asked, rubbing his hand over Taz’s hip.\\n\\n Taz nodded, tense again. He glanced over his shoulder and his voice was so quiet, Kyle had to strain to hear it. “Will…will it hurt?” His voice sounded a bit ragged.\\n\\n Kyle hesitated. “A little. But I’ll try to make it good for you.”\\n\\n He kissed Taz’s back and then slid inside him, the velvety tightness gripping his cock and squeezing it until Kyle gasped and he pulled out a little. “Let me in, baby. You’re so tight. Push out, okay? I don’t want to hurt you.”\\n\\n Taz was breathing rapidly, his whole body trembling with the effort to stay still and both hands gripping the sheet beneath him so hard Kyle figured his sheets would be torn to shreds before this was over. “Relax, sweetheart. I want you to enjoy this.”\\n\\n Taz nodded and relaxed the tiniest bit. Kyle kissed his back and rubbed his hands down his sides, keeping his cock just inside, letting him adjust to it. Gradually, Taz began to relax his death-grip on the sheets.\\n\\n Kyle reached beneath his body and took hold of Taz’s softened cock, gently stroking it as it filled out in his hand. Taz groaned and a wave of tenderness washed over Kyle. “Let me love you, baby. I only want to make you feel good.”\\n\\n Taz nodded, and Kyle continued stroking him. When he was hard, Kyle began pushing gently into his tight, little hole. Matching his movements to that of his hand, he set up a slow, gentle rhythm, and was able to push deeply inside Taz as his muscles relaxed. Kyle pressed his cheek to Taz’s back. “So good, Taz,” he said softly, and Taz pushed his butt back against Kyle’s groin. He shifted his angle, found the sweet spot, and brushed over it again and again. Taz groaned loudly and arched his back.\\n\\n Kyle began to move faster, unable to resist thrusting harder against him, and Taz reached behind him to put his hand on Kyle’s hip. “More, Nobyo,” he said softly.\\n\\n Kyle moaned, thrusting in and out as his hand curled around Taz’s cock, moving over it faster. With a guttural cry, Taz came, spilling over Kyle’s hand. Kyle’s own orgasm rushed over him, and he thrust hard hard into Taz’s ass, squeezing his cock at the same time. Kyle pulled Taz up so that his back was against his chest and bit him deeply on the back of the neck, sinking his fangs in his flesh. The orgasm intensified for both of them as Kyle came so hard he thought he might pass out. He put his head back and a howl ripped from his throat before he could stop it.\\n\\n Taz’s knees gave way and he collapsed to fall down on the bed. Kyle went with him, still inside him, and not really wanting to ever pull out. He sucked the blood as it seeped out, then licked the back of his neck where the blood was trickling down, kissing the spot over and over. Taz rolled on his side so that Kyle could spoon him, and they both lay still, trying to catch their breath. The bite mark had already started to heal over but it would leave a scar, marking Taz as his mate. He had made the bite mark high on his neck so it would always show that he’d been claimed by his Lycan mate.\\n\\n Kyle gazed over at that mate now. Taz was reacting to Kyle’s bite and was already intoxicated by the venom and the force of his orgasm. His eyes were half closed, and he was breathing fast. Kyle knew that he would run a high fever now for at least a couple of hours, depending on his Tygerian metabolism. The venom wouldn’t harm him, just change his body chemistry a bit. Most mates became stronger and even more beautiful from the effects. Damn, if Taz got any stronger or more handsome, Kyle wasn’t sure if he’d be able to stand it. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/captive-wolf-love-slaves-of-the-alphas-5/page-23.html","bookId":1595,"book":{"id":1595,"title":"Captive Wolf (Love Slaves of the Alphas #5)","description":"Storyline: Captive Wolf (Love Slaves of the Alphas #5) \\n Kyle travels with his bounty hunter cousin, Blayde, to arrest Tarr Bonnet, an exotic, handsome Tygerian national who trades in love slaves all over the galaxies.
