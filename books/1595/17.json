I’m too tired right now.” “What?” Instantly awake, Kyle struggled to sit up and stare down at an almost asleep Taz. He opened one eye and chuckled, pulling him back down beside him. “Just a little one, baby. I’m a kind master. You’ll see.” He leaned over and kissed Kyle on the lips, nuzzling his nose against his face. His nobyo had slept badly. For an hour or so after they went to bed, he’d tossed and turned restlessly, and Taz thought it might be the stickiness of his skin. He got out of bed and obtained a warm cloth, coming back to tenderly wash the dried cum from his nobyo’s stomach and the backs of his legs. The entire time he cared for his nobyo, he’d looked steadily up at him with those beautiful, strange eyes. When Taz got back in bed, he’d scooted his ass up to him and sighed like a tired child, but he’d still been uneasy the rest of the night, having bad dreams, from the way he squirmed and reached back for Taz. Taz held him tightly in his arms the rest of the night. Taz wondered if he was worried about the spanking he’d promised him and smiled to himself. He’d been mostly teasing the night before, but the more he thought about it, the harder his dick became. Not because he had any desire to humiliate or hurt him, but because he thought it might add spice to the sex that already far exceeded any of his expectations. His poor nobyo was so confused, and it hurt Taz to watch his struggles. His nobyo still thought submission was a sign of weakness, and he longed to show him it was more a sign of deep trust. If his nobyo could only learn to trust him with everything—his fears, his embarrassment, his doubts—then they could begin to build their future. He only wanted to care for his nobyo and give him a perfect life. Taz knew the main obstacle was that he worried too much about what his Lycan family might think of him, instead of just relaxing and letting things happen. He’d been aware from the beginning that his nobyo wasn’t a true alpha. He’d met these Lycan alphas when he was held in their prisons. Many of them had been his guards, and they were an arrogant, domineering bunch. Not so with his nobyo, who was gentler and much more reasonable. He was strong and brave too, and would make an excellent life partner. If only Taz could kick the other alphas in the family out of their bedroom. He decided there was no time like the present to start that process. “Wake up, sweet one.” He bent over his face and kissed his cheek. “Time to wake up. Shall we have your punishment before breakfast and get it out of the way?” His nobyo widened his eyes and stared up at him. “My-my…punishment?” “Yes, darling.” Taz stretched and scooted up so that his back was against the massive headboard of his bed. He made himself comfortable by pulling the pillows behind his back, then patted his lap. “Come here, Nobyo.” He saw his lover take a long look at the door, wondering perhaps if he could make it. His face was so expressive that he clearly saw the realization that even if he did, he’d only be brought back. He crawled slowly toward Taz and knelt beside him, looking down at his lap. “Is this really necessary? Can’t I just stand?” “No, you can’t. This will be much more comfortable for both of us.” “For you, maybe.” He cut his eyes up resentfully and then sighed. “Sorry, Taz-lan. Just-just give me a minute.” “I’ll help you,” he said, smiling. Taz reached for him and hauled him over his lap so that he was lying face down. His naked cock lay against Taz’s thighs, and he was glad that it was not entirely soft at all. He reached beneath him and rubbed a thumb over the head. Pre-cum had begun to dampen it, and his nobyo moved restlessly. He got up on his elbows, but Taz pushed him back down. “No, lie still.” He smoothed his hand down his ass slowly and trailed a finger down his crease. “Can you tell me why this is necessary, darling?” His nobyo shook his head. “No idea.” Taz gave him a little smack to the roundest part of his ass. It couldn’t have hurt, and Taz smiled to see him jump. “Okay, okay. I guess something about me not showing proper respect.” “What about it?” Taz asked, stroking his ass. His nobyo gave a resigned sigh. “You want me to do it. To say Taz-lan when I talk to you.” “And why is that?” “Because it means…” He made a little choking sound on the word. “Master.” “Do you know that I’m your master, sweet one?” “Um…yeah, sure.” Another smack. His nobyo rose partially up, only to be pushed back down. “Stay still.” Taz spread his legs so his nobyo’s cock fell down between his thighs and then clamped his thighs together, drawing forth a huge intake of breath from his nobyo. “What? I said yes, damn it—I mean, Taz-lan.” “Hmmm…I didn’t believe you. It was in your tone. Very unconvincing.” His nobyo blew out a frustrated breath and Taz smiled. It was fun teasing him like this. He stroked up and down his lover’s ass for a long time, enjoying the feel of his skin. He found his puckered hole, wet a finger and began to draw little circles around it. His nobyo groaned and banged his head against the soft pillows of the bed. “Hells, Taz-lan. Just get on with it.” Taz gave him another slap, enjoying the sight of his pink hand prints on the smooth, white skin. “I’ll decide when to get on with it, as you say. I assure you, I’m in no rush at all. Are you uncomfortable?” “What do you think?” Smack! “Do you really wish to be so impertinent considering your position across my lap? It’s not your business what I think. Answer the question.” “No. No, Taz-lan. Damn it!” Another slap landed on his cheeks, accompanied by Taz’s sigh. “Baby, why do you make me hurt you? No cursing. I think I’ll make that a rule for you, because you really do use shockingly bad language. Not a good example for our little one when he comes.” Taz caressed his nobyo’s ass with one hand while he slipped the finger in and reached up to find the little place inside his nobyo that made him so excited whenever he touched it. As he swept his finger over it, his nobyo’s hips rose and then slammed back down, apparently enjoying the friction of Taz’s thighs on his cock. He was breathing hard, and Taz allowed him to fuck himself for a few seconds before pushing his hips back down. “No, this is supposed to teach you a lesson, Nobyo. I think you’re enjoying it too much.” His nobyo turned a shocked gaze up to him over his shoulder. “I am not!” His face, however, turned an interesting shade of pink. “One or two more then, and we can go have first-meal. Unless, of course, you are enjoying it and wish to stay in bed with me for a while longer.” “I’m not.” “So your hard cock between my legs means what, exactly?” “Just please get on with this, Taz-lan.” “Do you think you might be able to come just from a spanking, darling?” He slipped another finger inside, crooked them both up and gave his spot inside a wickedly hard rub while he slapped his ass a little harder with the other hand. His nobyo surged down with his hips to get away from the mixture of pleasure and pain, and Taz tightened the muscles of his thighs to give him maximum stimulation. He rose back up with a little gasp to meet another smack and another internal rubdown, and that did it. With a shudder, his nobyo climaxed long and hard, shooting his cum between Taz’s thighs before collapsing back down, breathing hard and groaning. “Gods, I hate you…” “No, you don’t.” A little silence, then, “No…I don’t.” Taz pulled him up sharply, surprising a little noise out of him. He positioned him so that he was facing him, with his legs on either side of Taz’s body. He settled him right on top of his own aching cock and pushed him down firmly on top of it, eliciting another sharp intake of breath. His cheek pressing against his nobyo’s, Taz turned his head so that he brushed their lips together. “I think our first-meal will have to wait after all, baby,” he said, and began to thrust his hips. The servants fiddled with the camera equipment as Kyle waited impatiently for them to set it up and start filming. This wasn’t at all what he’d envisioned a few days before when Taz told him he could finally contact his family back on Lycanus, but he would take what he could get. Taz would film his message and send it electronically to Lycanus 3 through government channels. Since Tygeria was at war with the Alliance, no direct channel could be opened to them by law. Taz said some people still managed to download vids or contact relatives on other Alliance held planets through illegal channels, but as a representative of the Tygerian Senate, he had to set a proper example. A couple of days before, Taz had surprised him with this gift as they lay in bed together. Kyle had just awakened and was stretching his arms over his head when he winced from an old bruise he’d received in the arena when he sparred with Taz. “What’s the matter, Nobyo?” Taz leaned up and solicitously and put a hand on Kyle’s hip. Kyle smiled down at him. “Nothing really. Just some sore muscles still from that beat-down you gave me in the ring.” “I’m sorry, baby. I really thought you were only playing around at first. When I saw the blood, I stopped at once.” Kyle sighed and lay back down to snuggle into him. “It’s my own fault. I probably never should have challenged you, and I should have quit sooner. I just wanted you to respect me.” “I do respect you, darling. You were very courageous to fight me, and everyone remarked on how lucky I was to have such a brave, handsome nobyo. I had three offers for you before we got back home.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/captive-wolf-love-slaves-of-the-alphas-5/page-17.html","bookId":1595,"book":{"id":1595,"title":"Captive Wolf (Love Slaves of the Alphas #5)","description":"Storyline: Captive Wolf (Love Slaves of the Alphas #5) Kyle travels with his bounty hunter cousin, Blayde, to arrest Tarr Bonnet, an exotic, handsome Tygerian national who trades in love slaves all over the galaxies.
