It\u0027s pages promised the power of the Witch-King himself. And now that it\u0027s been found, even the fact that it kills anyone foolish enough to crack its cover won\u0027t stop people from fighting over it. Welcome to the Bloodstone Lands! Human assassin Artemis Entreri and his dark elf companion Jarlaxle have come to the demon-haunted wastelands of the frozen north at the request of their dragon patron. It doesn\u0027t take long for them to find themselves caught in the middle of a struggle between powerful forces that would like nothing more than to see them both dead... or worse. But Entreri and Jarlaxle aren\u0027t just any wandering sellswords, and the ancient evils and bitter blood-feuds of the wild Bloodstone Lands may have finally met their match.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/promise-of-the-witch-king-the-sellswords-2.jpg","author":"R.A.
