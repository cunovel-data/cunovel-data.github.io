{"id":28893,"no":21,"title":"CHAPTER XX.","content":"Thompson could scarcely credit his senses when he heard that flogging had been abolished on board the Stinger. \"What!\" he observed to the boatswain, \"are we free, then?\" \"I\u0027m surprised at you, Thompson; as if you was not free afore!\" \"Well, Mr. Shever, you don\u0027t mean to tell me that you really believes that a man thinks hisself free, when at any moment he may find the cat-o\u0027-nine-tails flying across his back, do you?\" \"You don\u0027t look at it in a proper light, Jerry. A commander on one of her Majesty\u0027s ships-of-war has got to be a big man, or no one thinks anything of him. Now, all the while he has power to flake his men they fears him, and he can cow the biggest roughs among them; but take it away, and see what a lame-entable prelude would follow.\" \"Gammon! You ain\u0027t a-going to persuade me to that, sir. Why, look at us now. Don\u0027t all of the fellers like the captain and first lieutenant? and they doesn\u0027t hold with flogging. Formerly the cussing on board was strong enough to curl an iron rod, and now we gets on very nicely, and lots of our men are learning to read and write in Lieutenant Russell\u0027s evening school. It takes more than articles of war to keep blue jackets in order, and I knows I shouldn\u0027t like to be flaked, and don\u0027t believe you would, sir.\" \"Nonsense, Thompson! I\u0027m surprised you can\u0027t look at this in its proper light! Ain\u0027t all a captain does right? Why, they knows more than any one else; and if any one offends them, ain\u0027t it proper for \u0027em to take it out of their backs? I say so! The men is inferiors, and the officers is born to rule over them, therefore if dissatisfied demagogues and age-itators choose to think they is as good as their officers, let \u0027em do it; but as your friend, let me advise you to steer clear of all such fools.\" \"I don\u0027t believe one man is born a bit better than another, sir; and as to your idea that God made some men to rule others, it\u0027s all my eye. I think that the captain in his sittyvation is just as much bound to do what is right as we who are under him, and I know the cat-o-nine-tails ain\u0027t any use in keeping discipline, and that it\u0027s played the deuce with many a good feller.\" \"Chut, chut. Why, I know lots of really good men who would leave the service when their time expired, if flogging were abolished.\" \"Then all I can say, Mr. Shever, is, that you knows a lot of fools; and if any of them was to up and say such a lie in my company, I\u0027ll tell them just what I do you. I\u0027ve heered a slave in the Brazils say as how he wouldn\u0027t be free if they gev him the chance, and that slavery was a thundering good thing for everybody wot hadn\u0027t got no money.\" \"Well, he was right. It is a fine thing for poor people. What are all the poor people at home but slaves? only they ain\u0027t called so. He was a sensible man, and spoke the truth.\" \"Hold hard, sir! Hear me out. Well, I kept my eye on that feller, and thought what a precious mean thing a man was when he gave up all ideas of trying to assert[Pg 153] his rights, but the slave would every day have some chat about how comfortable it was to think he would be provided for in his old age by his indulgent master, until we got a little sick of it, particular as his old man hoisted him up one morning, and gave him a lot of lashes with a cowhide.\" \"Well, I suppose he deserved it?\" \"Hold hard! let me finish my yarn, sir. He was flaked upon the wharf, and all of us chaps—we was in a merchant ship where the skipper daren\u0027t flog us—looked on and swore we\u0027d pound his master if we only caught him alone. Well, would you believe it? when he was cast off, the feller actually walked to his master, knelt down, and, afore everybody, begged he would forgive him for having given him so much trouble.\" \"He was a sensible man.\" \"Werry sensible. We sailed that night; and just as I was castin\u0027 off the gangway plank down rushes the slave, and as he spoke English very well, he hails me. \u0027What do you want?\u0027 sez I. But afore I had hardly got the words out of my mouth he jumps aboard, and saying, \u0027Hide me. I\u0027ve killed my master,\u0027 dived below and hid hisself.\" \"Do you call that sensible behaviour?\" \"Rather, Mr. Shever. I held my tongue, and when we was out to sea hunted him out, and giv him some grub, when he told me that as he couldn\u0027t put up with the lash no longer, he had killed his owner, and chanced escaping in our ship, and that all his fine talk about liking to be flogged was only done to blind his master.\" \"Do you think that a small affair like a flogging justified him in killing his superior?\" \"I don\u0027t know anything about superiors in that way, sir, but I knows one thing, that if any man was to flake me for his own amusement, I\u0027d not hesitate to do as he did, as I don\u0027t think I belong to the dog speecee, if you does, Mr. Shever.\" With a look meant to express contempt blended with pity for one so utterly lost to reason, Mr. Shever stopped further discussion by replying, \"Silence, you ungrateful young man! Never speak to me again unless on duty. I wash my hands of you and all as holds such revolutionary opinions. I\u0027m sorry Captain Puffeigh is not in command:\" saying which he turned away with an oath, and went below. Jerry eyed his form as it vanished down the hatchway, and then remarked to the men who had gathered round him during the conversation, \"Sorry the old skipper ain\u0027t in the ship. Ugh! you blood-thirsty brute! Sorry you can\u0027t cut us up with the lash, as you did under bully Crushe. Cut my acquaintance! I cuts yours, as I\u0027d scorn to be upon speaking terms with a warrant-officer as holds such opinions as you does. I wish your wife could hear you talk like that; she\u0027d put you to rights, I know.\" Thompson heard the news of the attack upon Canton; and, with the rest of his shipmates burned to be present at the bombardment of that city. The sailors seemed to think that they would prefer to be where they could give hard knocks, and it produced no little amount of growling when mail after mail arrived, and still no orders to move. At length, however, when the spring had well advanced, a P. and O. steamer calling at Chin-hae, sent up dispatches directing Captain Paul Woodward to start for Hong-Kong with all possible dispatch; whereupon he proceeded to get ready for sea, and within twenty-four hours they dropped down to Chin-hae, and getting up steam, left for the south. The steamer carrying the dispatches had also brought their mailbags, and Clare had several letters from his wife, parts of which he read to his friend; while, strange to say, the latter received one from his mother, of whom he had not heard for years; and as it will serve to show how forgetful some sailors are of those for whom they really entertain great affection, we give her letter. [Pg 154] \"Nonnington, Kent. \"2 January, —— \"My Dear Boy, \"I am rejoiced to hear you\u0027re alive and well,[3] and you will be pleased to know I am, considering my age, quite hearty. I suppose you don\u0027t think I\u0027m alive, or would have written to me. Now I hope, if these few lines reach you, to receive a letter in return from my youngest born, who I love, although I have not seen or heard from him for eleven years. You will be wondering how I came to hear of you. Well, to make a long story short I were a sitting by the fire one snowy night about a month ago, when some one knocked at the door and begged shelter for pity\u0027s sake, as he were near frozen. Your Cousin Ellen, who lives with me—I live now in \u0027Trotman\u0027s Charity.\u0027 You know the row of almshouses. Very comfortable they are, too, and good of the founder, who has been dead two hundred years. Well, Ellen, who writes this for me, went to the door and saw a man covered with snow, and nearly starved from cold. I asked him to come in and draw up to the fire, seeing he were a sailor; and after he got a little thawed, he told me his name was Harry Tomlin, and that he\u0027d run away from a man-of-war at the Cape of Good Hope, then entered a ship bound for Australia, where he landed without a shilling; and he gave us a long account of his adventures, how he\u0027d made some money, and had arrived in England a few days ago, and were bound to Eythorne that night, but had been overtaken by the snow, and nearly frozen to death. Me and Ellen heard his story with tears in our eyes; and when he had finished I asked him if ever he had been in a merchant ship, as I had a dear boy who were a sailor, and who were, I feared no more. Upon which he says, \u0027But why not in a man-of-war, marm?\u0027 \u0027Because,\u0027 I said, \u0027my Jerry were too good-tempered as a lad to spill people\u0027s blood, and I know he wouldn\u0027t enter a man-of-war; Heaven forbid,\u0027 said I. \u0027Jerry, marm,\u0027 he said. \u0027Why, you never mean to say Jerry Thompson, do you?\u0027 Upon hearing of which I fainted away, and were some time before I could hear all about your being so good and clever; and, in fact, you ought to be a captain but for the regulations not allowing. He left the next day after giving me your direction, and I have sent this letter to the place he said. Now, my dear boy, write me as soon as you can, and believe I love you as much as ever. With love, in which Ellen joins, I am your affectionate mother, \"Fanny Thompson.\" \"P. S. The old lady gets about wonderfully, and with your aunt, Mary Golder; is living in the alms-house where Miss Hoodruff used to live. They both talk a great deal about you, and it will be a dutiful act for you to write to her now and then. Probably you have forgotten me, as I was but a child when you left, but I remember you gave me a kiss when you bade me good-bye. \"Your loving cousin, \"Ellen.\" Thompson read the foregoing very carefully, and before they arrived in port wrote a long letter in reply, which he sent home by the first mail, and never afterwards missed an opportunity of letting his mother know about his welfare. Upon their arrival in Hong-Kong, where a large fleet was assembled. Captain Woodward received orders to proceed to the Bocca Tigris Forts in the Canton river; and without an hour\u0027s delay, after getting in provisions, water, and ammunition, they steamed out of the harbour, and in a short time anchored off the Wantung Forts,[Pg 155] where they landed their marines and as many blue-jackets as they could spare, to form a garrison. One morning, as the bugle was going for parade, a steamer hove in sight, and in a short time Captain Woodward received instructions to embark on board his boats with his spare seamen and the whole of his marines, who were each to carry at least sixty rounds of ammunition, and when the gun-boats came up, to go on board them, and proceed to the attack of the Imperial junks then assembled in Chow-chan Creek. When the boats were manned and armed, the commander directed them to pull out towards the flotilla, which had not been long in making its appearance. As the gun-boats came up, it was noticed that each was towing a long string of boats, cutters, pinnaces, and gigs, and upon seeing the Stingers, one of them stopped to receive them on board; then, having made fast her boats, gave a shrill whistle, and started after her companions, Beauman, who was left in charge, dipping the ensign by way of salute as they passed the ship. The gun-boats steamed away at full speed up the Canton river—now between high banks, which completely shut them in, and prevented their seeing anything of the surrounding country; now in places where the stream wound through a flat district, entirely given up to rice cultivation; while their appearance, instead of intimidating the Chinese who worked in the fields, seemed to give them a great deal of amusement, as in some places the labourers would gather upon the banks and shout derisively to the Fanquis, who were going up to be eaten by the Imperial tigers at Chow-chan. Here and there on either side of the banks they passed the ruins of forts destroyed by the ships the year before, but no attempt was made to molest them until they arrived within about three miles of the barrier, where a drunken bannerman stood upon the bank with a \"brave\u0027s\" matchlock, and after shouting and gesticulating, brought the whole flotilla to a standstill. \"What do you want?\" hailed the interpreter. \"Go back, you red-headed, unshaven barbarians, you pink-eyed, man-eating fiends—go back! go back!\" \"What does he say?\" demanded the commander of H.M.S. Squelcher, which was the leading boat. \"He says we\u0027re to go back.\" \"Tell him to—Go on ahead, full speed,\" testily replied the latter, as he noticed through his glass that the bannerman was intoxicated. \"Signal flying from the Jolter. What have you stopped for?\" \"Reply, All right, and go on ahead.\" Seeing the audacious red-haired demons did not comply with his modest order, the bannerman levelled his matchlock and managed to plump a ball aboard the Squelcher, upon which her commander directed a sentry to fire. The marine coolly raised his rifle—took a careful sight—then crack went the piece, and the daring bannerman, placing his hands upon his waistband, as though suddenly seized with cholera, doubled himself up and rolled down into the river, where he was drowned like a kitten. After passing through the barriers, which were formed of thick piles driven across the river, the flotilla came to anchor a little below the entrance of Chow-chan creek, and just astern of H.M. ships Blowfly and Porpoise, on board of which the men who could not find accommodation in the gun-boats passed the night. About an hour before the first streaks of light, dawned in the sky the men were turned out, the boats manned, and made fast to the gun-boats. The latter got up anchor, and steamed slowly towards the enemy. A thick mist hung about the fleet[Pg 156] of junks anchored up the creek, and it was not until the gun-boats opened fire with their heavy rockets that the Chinese seemed fully awake, although they had been beating gongs and letting off crackers all night; however, when they found the rockets flying about them, they returned the compliment to the best of their ability, and a small fort situated upon an eminence to the left opened a deadly fire, but it was at once assaulted and carried by the officer who commanded the expedition. This done, the guns of the fort were directed upon the junks ranged upon two sides of a delta formed by the junction of Chow-chan with another creek, then the gun-boats crossed the front of the low island, and, under a murderous fire, proceeded up the right channel. Boats were sunk,—oars cut off short at the loom,—and men killed and thrown overboard during the terrible moments they were exposed to a perfect hail of shot from the war junks; but in spite of the shower of missiles, which included copper nails, cash, and links of chain, the gun-boats steadily advanced, and threw shot, shell, and rockets into the enemy with great precision; and although several of them got aground, they managed to get off again, and renewed the fight with greater vigour than before. Some most gallant acts were performed, and one captain led on his men sword in hand until his boat was sinking under him, when he stepped from it into one that was passing, and, in spite of the deadly storm of missiles which flew around him, coolly tore a strip of blue serge off a sailor\u0027s garment, and hoisting the scrap upon a boat-hook, cried, \"The blue never surrenders,\" then again cheered the sailors on to the attack. He had with him in his gig a fine Newfoundland dog, but as the coxswain who attended it, was killed and went down with the boat, the animal would not leave the spot, but was picked up some time afterwards. After a desperate combat, during which a great many men were killed or wounded, one of the junks blew up, and it was soon observed that the rest were endeavouring to move off towards Chow-chan. The gun-boats finding the range of the junks, which were fast getting aground through the falling of the tide, now kept up a deadly fire with their heavy bow guns; and, after a desperate resistance, the Chow-chan fleet, commanded by one of the most able scholars of the country, was reduced to a mere wreck. Some junks escaped and reached Canton, where Yeh immediately imprisoned their officers for not having thrashed the \"red-headed barbarians,\" but the greater part of the fleet, burnt down to their magazines, then blew up and scattered their timbers all over the creek. The ship\u0027s boats approached the burning vessels, and even passed them, in spite of the war rockets piled inside the junks, which would ignite, and tearing through the sides, go flying over the boats, in some cases dropping into them and killing the sailors. As the Chinese admiral expected a pretty severe engagement, he had ordered that men who had never before been in action were to be chained to their guns, and this command was pretty generally adopted by the captains. When the junks exploded the poor wretches were elevated in batches; and their yells, when they caught fire, were plainly heard by the sailors, who, however, did not seem to be much affected thereby. Not contented with merely destroying the Chinese fleet, the fire-eating captain who had lost his gig, upon falling in with a few of his own boats, actually pursued some flying junks as far as Chow-chan city, and, mounting a boat\u0027s gun upon the wall, coolly declared he took possession of that place. After having terrified a number of the Chow-channers nearly out of their senses and causing the Taontai to almost die with fright, he recalled his men, and returned to the flotilla, which by that time had mustered preparatory to returning. As they passed down the creek they picked up the dead bodies of those who had been killed and thrown overboard during the action, and having conveyed them [Pg 157]alongside H. M. S. Blow-fly, the crew of that ship, after dark, buried them in the mud of the river. When the flotilla arrived alongside the ships they discharged most of their men to them, and anchored until the next morning, the Stingers being drafted to the Porpoise. They had been all day without taking a regular meal, and were consequently very hungry; but, to their astonishment and disgust, after having smelt the savoury perfume of the soup, which was boiling in her coppers, they with the crew were piped aft to hear the \"Thanksgiving after a victory\" read by a well-fed clergyman, who had (very properly) \"viewed the battle from afar.\" There, with the enticing vapour of rich soup steaming from the galley, and rendering them more hungry than before, the grimy, tired, thirsty tars were tortured with a form which might just as well have been gone through after their bodies were refreshed; but the Reverend Mr. Service considered his feelings ought to be consulted before a lot of common sailors, so he had the first innings; and as he prayed the wicked tars did just the reverse, and when the service was over, they were out of temper, the soup burnt, and a general feeling of discontent experienced by all, except the Reverend gentleman, who beat the assistant-surgeon twice running at chess; and, upon retiring to rest, dreamed he was appointed Bishop of Chow-chan, with a large endowment, and permission to live in Paris, or go anywhere but to his See. Upon their return to the Stinger, her crew learned they were to proceed to Hong-Kong and refit; so within a week of the battle of Chow-chan the whole of them had enjoyed a run on shore in the settlement, and, getting short of money, were quite ready for sea again. During the vessel\u0027s stay in port on this occasion a most interesting event occurred, at which all the Stingers were invited to assist. This was the marriage of Miss Moore, whom they had rescued from the pirates, with a wealthy merchant of Hong-Kong, named Mackay; and on the day of the ceremony the crew, having been granted a holiday, marched to the church, and formed a double line from the door of the sacred edifice. As the bride, leaning on the arm of Captain Woodward, passed through this guard of honour, the grateful girl stopped and inquired for Thompson. This ordinarily self-possessed individual, on stepping forward, was so confused, that he blushed like a maiden. \"How are you, my good friend?\" said the warm-hearted girl. \"I should indeed have been sorry if you had not been here to-day.\" \"I\u0027m pretty well, miss,\" replied the sailor, bewildered by the charming sight, and perhaps slightly uneasy in his mind relative to the kiss he had been bold enough to take from one so lovely, under circumstances previously related, \"and it\u0027s real glad I feel to see you looking so well and so beautiful.\" \"He must go into the church with us, Captain Woodward,\" pleaded the young lady. \"Anything in the world to make your happiness complete,\" smilingly rejoined that gallant officer. By some means Thompson was placed in a pew near a Chinese lady\u0027s-maid, who during the ceremony made big eyes at him, and otherwise endeavoured to attract his attention; but he was proof against her allurements: so, finding her glances thrown away upon him, she turned her battery against the heart of a susceptible midshipman, who thereupon fell in love with her, and, before many days were over, seriously offered to wed her, a proposition which she wisely rejected. When the ceremony was completed, and the former Miss Moore saluted as Mrs. Mackay, her husband looked about, and[Pg 158] asked where the sailor was to whom he owed so much. Upon which the master pointed out Thompson, who was looking at the group with a very admiring air. \"Thompson, let me thank you for your great care of the dear girl who is now my wife. Come, she wishes to speak for herself.\" During this speech the bride had been saluted by nearly all the officers, and there was no mistaking the meaning of the happy bridegroom when he led the sailor forward and presented him to his wife. Had he been the Thompson of old no doubt he would have availed himself of the occasion; but instead of that he bowed, and wishing her every happiness that the world could afford, amid the smiles of the officers, quietly pulled the stubby hair upon his forehead, and left the church. \"I could no more ha\u0027 kissed that beautiful woman afore all them there officers than I could have flied,\" he observed to one of his chums. Possibly he was a little quelled by the presence of his commander, but the fact was he thought of A-tae, and the memory prevented him taking advantage of a woman\u0027s gratitude for the very slight service he considered he had rendered. While the wedding breakfast was in progress, the sailors and their friends were entertained in the grand marquee, erected for their special accommodation; and in the evening Jerry and others performed for their amusement, the affair terminating with a grand hornpipe by the company, who declared they would like to rescue a young lady every day, if the exploit would be followed by such a real good feed as Mr. Mackay gave them. They enjoyed themselves like men, and a few of them danced until they were obliged to retire to the outside of the marquee and sleep off the effects of the exercise; but as a body they behaved in a manner which was a compliment to their officers, and a credit to themselves. Mrs. Mackay was always a firm friend to the sailors belonging to the men-of-war, and many were the baskets of fruit she sent to the sick on board H. M. S. Dead-and-alive; while, through her intercession, several poor fellows escaped the lash, as she would, when men misbehaved themselves on shore, get her husband to plead in their behalf; and was so much thought of by the sailors, that when she appeared in the streets they would cease their talk, take their pipes out of their mouths, and salute her with the utmost respect. Thompson was often invited to her house, but would never stay more than a few moments; however, one day she entrapped him into conversation, whereupon he told her about A-tae. After hearing his story to the end, she wiped her eyes, which had been suffused during his recital of the tragic fate of the poor girl, and bade him never forget such a love, but at the same time not to shut his heart against the sex, as she doubted not there was a good girl waiting for him somewhere; and if he would take courage, no doubt when he reached home he would meet with her. To which kind speech Jerry replied with a touch of his old drollery. \"That\u0027s true enough, miss\" (he always persisted in calling her so, in spite of her gently correcting him), \"but the worst of it is, it ain\u0027t only one as is a waiting for me,—that\u0027s what I\u0027m thinking of. It\u0027s hard, ain\u0027t it? to be afraid of former promises.\" It will thus be seen that there was still some hope for the love-stricken sailor, who after that interview somewhat recovered from his apathy, and before they left Hong-Kong had almost made up his mind to write to Mary Ann. However, upon hearing they were ordered to Japan, he changed his determination, and decided to wait until they returned. What was Mary Ann about all the time? Waiting patiently for him, he imagined. Let us take a peep at her. Upon receiving the news of her lover\u0027s death the poor girl went into mourning, and[Pg 159] grieved as much as though he had been her husband; but being good-looking, the young men of her acquaintance did not give her much peace, so she quitted the service of Mrs. Puffeigh, and went to live with her sister, Mrs. Shever, who had opened a small dress-making establishment in Portsmouth. Here she endeavoured to forget her sorrows; but at times her sister, who was uncommonly fond of digging up buried memories, would refer to the departed sailor, upon which they would both have a good cry, and then fall to work upon the dresses in hand with greater energy than ever. However, after some months had elapsed, the young man described in Jerry\u0027s letter as the \"carpenter who was after no goode,\" would come in and chat with the lone women, and even bring papers of candy, and other love offerings, which he cunningly presented to Mrs. Shever, who regularly handed them over to Mary Ann, as soon as her lover had departed. This diagonal sort of courtship was kept for a long time without his coming to the point, until one afternoon the sighing swain appeared with an order for the theatre, and Mary Ann being absent, the boatswain\u0027s wife shut the door, and fiercely demanded what he wanted to be always lolloping about their premises for, upon which, being cornered, the bashful youth blurted out, \"Your sister, of course.\" \"What do you want with her? Mind, I\u0027ll have no trifling.\" \"Who\u0027s agoing to trifle? do I look like a trifler?\" demanded the brawny youth with an injured air. \"Well, you\u0027d better not, that\u0027s all! But what do you mean by your candy, and your theatre orders? Speak out!\" \"I means all right; that\u0027s what I means. I never walked with a gal before in my life, and I likes Polly too much to come here and not mean anything.\" \"But what do you want to walk with her for?\" screamed the excited matron who began to fear her sister would return before she had wormed the confession out of the bashful young carpenter. \"Why I wants to marry she, but she be so mighty shy, that I haven\u0027t had a chance,\" bellowed the youth in his own patois; \"there! now I feels better, havin\u0027 told you.\" Upon this Mrs. Shever mollified her manner, and having agreed to his proposal to visit the theatre, she dismissed him with the remark that if he didn\u0027t declare his intentions that evening she\u0027d wait for him, as he left the dockyard the next day. About half-past six Mary Ann and her sister were dressed and awaiting his arrival, when a knock was heard at the front door, and presently in marched the enamoured youth, bearing in each hand an enormous bouquet made up of cabbage roses, and other sweet-smelling but somewhat gaudy flowers. As he advanced he caught Mrs. Shever\u0027s eye, and recollecting her threat, plumped down upon one knee, dropped his offerings, and blurted out, \"Mary Ann, wilt have me for your feller?\" The boatswain\u0027s wife prudently left the room. \"Come, lass, thee might as well say yea. I\u0027m moighty fond of thee.\" \"Really, Mr. Jenkins, you have taken me so by surprise, I—Don\u0027t squeeze my hand so,—you\u0027re hurting me.\" \"Come, my dear lass, put me out of moi misery. Say no, and I\u0027ll blow out moi brains; say yes, and I\u0027ll gie thee a hearty kiss.\" Just then Mary Ann heard a light tapping at the window, so she observed in a very low voice, \"I should—be very sorry—to—to—think you—would injure yourself out of regard for me—so I\" (here the tapping became very distinct) \"will say yes to save you from—\" [Pg 160] \"Bless thy heart, my dear gal. I\u0027ll treat thee like a queen,\" cried the elated carpenter, giving the blushing girl a hug, which almost took her breath away, at which opportune moment her sister returned. \"Good gracious! why, what are you about, Mr. Jenkins?\" \"Only adoin\u0027 what you told me,\" replied the lover. \"Me told you, Mr. Jenkins?\" \"There, there, name the day, and let\u0027s get it over,\" said the youth. But Mary Ann was not to be carried by storm in that way; so she put off replying to the question until they returned from the theatre, where unluckily they saw \"Romeo and Juliet\" acted; and the girl would persist in crying during the performance, as it reminded her so strongly of the never-to-be-forgotten night. However, after partaking of a light supper consisting of a beefsteak-pudding and baked potatoes, upon Mrs. Shever artfully reminding the lover that Polly had not replied to his request, and begging it might be done at once, that she could drink their health and happiness with her first sup of porter, the poor girl consented; and upon the day Mrs. Mackay advised Thompson \"to think of the good girl waiting for him somewhere at home,\" Mary Ann found herself, \"until death did her part,\" joined to the young carpenter who was after no good, and became Mrs. Joseph Jenkins, thus demonstrating the folly of Jerry\u0027s illusion, \"that Mary Ann would keep.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2685/73942.html","bookId":1483,"book":{"id":1483,"title":"Blue Jackets","description":"简介： The most cruel and ignominious punishment man can inflict upon his fellow men, is still enforced in the English Naval Service; though many indignantly deny it, and stigmatize this story as a libel on the British Navy.
