{"id":28898,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER XXV.","content":"A few days before the Stinger left the China station the P. and O. steamer Jowra arrived in harbour, and within an hour of her coming to anchor it was rumoured through the fleet that Captain Woodward and Lieutenant Russell were promoted. This news was received with great demonstration of delight by the Stingers; but when they heard that their good commander was to go home by the overland route, and that their first lieutenant had orders to take charge of H. M. S. Polecat, which had just arrived on the station, their pleasure gave way to regret. Woodward was exceedingly sorry to leave his men, but he wished to see his family, and a son and heir, born about two weeks after his departure from home, so he gave his steward orders to pack his clothes, and within six hours after he received the news was on his way to Singapore in the return P. and O. steamer. By this time a morose-looking individual, named Tortle, had read his commission, and taken charge of the Stinger. As Woodward left the ship the men clustered round to bid him good-bye, and the tears trickled down some of their faces, when he stood up at the gangway, and exclaimed, \"Good-bye, my brave fellows! God bless you all.\" \"There goes the best captain in the service, and it\u0027s a black day for us.\" \"Why?\" \"Why, indeed! I knows, worse luck. We\u0027ve been free under that gentleman, but bully Tortle will have the gratings rigged afore we have been at sea a week, see if he don\u0027t.\" \"Do you know him?\" \"Don\u0027t I? I sailed in the old Spider with him, and a worse tempered man never wore uniform. He\u0027s all honey one day, and winneger the next.\" Captain Tortle was what is called in the navy a disappointed man, never having been lucky enough to get promoted, according to what he considered his merits, and had done all sorts of naval drudgery for some years, but being ordered out to China as commander of the Stinger, was promised promotion upon his return in that ship; so his only object was to get home as quickly as possible. Ill-natured people said he drank secretly; and if an inflamed visage and generally bloated appearance are criterions, it may safely be said they were not far wrong in their assertions. Upon joining the ship he read his commission, said he was glad to see the ship was ready for sea, and then ordered the acting boatswain to pipe down. Upon the following day Lieutenant Russell left the ship, and to the surprise of the officers and crew, \"Nosey\" Cravan made his appearance on board, and announced his appointment as first lieutenant. After a few days\u0027 delay, during which about twenty of the best men in the ship volunteered to remain out upon the station, provided they were allowed to exchange into Captain Russell\u0027s vessel, which offer was at once accepted, and the same number of indifferent hands transferred to the Stinger, Captain Tortle received instructions to proceed to sea; and upon the first of August the ship steamed slowly out of the harbour, amid hearty cheers from the crews of the ships at anchor. As they passed H. M. S. Polecat, their late first lieutenant stood upon the bridge and waved his cap, [Pg 195]exclaiming, \"There go the happy fellows; what a nice voyage they will have,\" little thinking how miserable they really were, and forgetting it was his humanity and Woodward\u0027s generous example which had raised them to what they were when he left the ship. The Stingers were sad at heart when they bade adieu to Hong-Kong, and the voyage which all had looked forward to as one of the happiest they could imagine, now seemed fraught with trouble and discomfort. Cravan did not mince matters, but let the men know they were once more under the command of a tyrant, and all Russell\u0027s improvements and plans for their benefit were ruthlessly abolished. Three days after they left the harbour it came on to blow, and in directing part of the watch to perform some duty, upon their failing to carry out the order to his satisfaction, the first lieutenant swore at them so brutally, that the men, who were old hands on board, determined to wait upon the commander and endeavour to prevent such language being used towards them for the remainder of the voyage. So the next day the sailors who had been abused went aft, and respectfully submitted their case to Tortle, who was steadying himself against the capstan, evidently slightly the worse for liquor. \"What do you want, my men?\" \"If you please, sir,\" said the spokesman, respectfully removing his cap, \"yesterday the first lieutenant swore at us, and abused us in a way as we hasn\u0027t been used to: our last captain wouldn\u0027t allow no bad language, and we have kind of dropped it. Now, sir, will you be so kind as to speak to the first lieutenant, so as to prewent this in future? We are all ready and willin\u0027 to do our duty, but beg to be treated like men.\" Now, the articles of war are very definite upon the matter of swearing, and they provide that any officer, seaman, or marine who shall be guilty of using profane language, shall be duly punished for the same; but, like many other admirable naval regulations, this only refers to officers upon paper, and is virtually a dead letter as far as they are concerned; so when the captain heard what the men had to say, he stared at them, and replied, \"You complain of Lieutenant Cravan swearing at you, do you?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Is that all?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Very well, that will do. You can go forward.\" Tortle laughed until the tears trickled down his cheeks. \"Oh, ha, ha, ha! Here\u0027s a crew—can\u0027t be sworn at. Oh, ha, ha, ha! I\u0027m—ha, ha,—hanged—!\" At that moment Cravan came up; and, seeing the commander laughing, joined in the merriment. \"What do you think, Cravan? Oh, ha, ha, ha! Those precious saints of Woodward\u0027s have actually had the cheek to come aft and—Oh, it\u0027s too much for me—to request I will be kind enough to ask you—Oh, ha, ha, ha!—it\u0027s too ridiculous—to leave off swearing.\" \"What did you tell them, sir?\" \"What did I say? Why, I said—ha, ha!—go forward, which meant—go to the devil! I wonder what next. Why, they\u0027ll want to hold prayer-meetings, bless them!\" After this there was a marked difference in the behaviour of the crew, who exhibited a sullen, dogged manner, when going about their duty; and by the time they reached Singapore more than one man was reported for punishment; but, in spite of Cravan\u0027s endeavours, the commander did not flog them. [Pg 196] \"I think that fellow deserves it, if ever a man did,\" observed the first lieutenant to Tortle, speaking of a fore-topman whom he had reported for some trivial offence. \"No doubt he does; all of them do, more or less. But the regulations are getting more severe; and if you flog for any less crime than mutiny you get a lot of bothering letters inquiring for particulars, and the newspapers take the matter up. I cannot flog the brutes for mere ordinary crimes; that time has passed, I am sorry to say. But if they only raise their voices in mutiny, I\u0027ll give them all they ask for—with the cat.\" \"You see, sir, Captain Woodward has spoilt the crew: taught them to believe they were of some importance, and given them ideas far above their position. It will be a very difficult matter to convince them they are liable to the lash now. Why, some of the fellows actually think, because you have not flogged the men I have reported to you within the last few days, that you have no power to punish them without a court-martial.\" \"Do they?\" chuckled the captain, cracking the joints of his fingers as he passed one hand over the other. \"Do they? Only let them mutiny, Mr. Cravan, then they will find out if the lash is abolished. It never will be until there\u0027s an Act of Parliament passed for that purpose, as we can always find reasons enough for its use; and if we do not choose to give any explanation, who can interfere with us as long as we only use it to suppress mutiny?\" \"But these are such a psalm-singing lot, that they won\u0027t mutiny.\" \"Then we wont flog them. Ha! ha! ha! Please, Cravan, don\u0027t swear at them. Have some regard for their feelings in future.\" One night, when Thompson had retired to bed, he was suddenly awakened by the sick-bay man, who informed him that Tom Clare was in a fit, and in a few moments he was by the side of his friend, whom he found in a state of great prostration. \"What\u0027s the matter, Tom?\" Evidently the sufferer did not know who it was that addressed him, and soon after Thompson saw the poor fellow\u0027s head fall upon his chest, and he seemed to all appearance dead. \"Take him into my cabin! I\u0027ll look after him,\" said the acting boatswain, and the inanimate form of poor Clare was conveyed into Thompson\u0027s cabin, where the doctor did his best to bring him to consciousness. As the surgeon stood by the man, with his fingers on his pulse, he observed, \"It\u0027s one of his old attacks, Mr. Thompson. Don\u0027t you remember he has suffered from them about this time every year?\" \"God bless us. What day of the month is this, sir?\" \"The sixteenth of August—sure enough it\u0027s what he used to call his wife\u0027s day. Poor fellow, he won\u0027t enjoy her society long, his constitution is too much impaired.\" \"Don\u0027t you think it\u0027s flogging has brought this on, sir?\" \"I cannot express an opinion, Thompson,\" the little doctor replied; but he knew full well that the lash was the cause of the poor fellow\u0027s trouble, although he could not say so. \"He ain\u0027t never been the same man since that cruel sentence was executed on him, sir. That and being separated from his wife has done it. See, he\u0027s reviving.\" After a time he became sensible, and spoke quite rationally to those near him, but he steadily refused to speak about what he had seen. \"It\u0027s a horrid dream, a kind of nightmare, and I know it ain\u0027t real. Please, Jerry, don\u0027t ask me nothing more about it.\" When the first lieutenant went his rounds the next morning, he observed Clare lying upon the bed in the acting boatswain\u0027s cabin, seeing which he sent for Mr. Thompson,[Pg 197] and sneeringly remarked that he did not approve of the warrant-officers\u0027 cabins being turned into hospitals. \"If you please, sir, may poor Clare remain there for a day or two? I don\u0027t think he will last long anyhow.\" \"No, sir; let him go into the sick-bay, along with the rest of the men. It won\u0027t do to show favour. Why, they will want me to turn out of my cabin next.\" \"Never fear, sir.\" \"What do you mean by that reply, Mr. Thompson?\" angrily demanded the bully. \"What I said, sir! No foremast hand would think of axing such a thing,\" coolly replied Jerry. \"Oh, very good. You must mind what you say. It will depend on me whether you are confirmed as boatswain or not, as Captain Tortle will be guided by my advice when he makes his report about you.\" \"I\u0027ll do my best to do my duty, sir; but maybe I shall never be a confirmed boatswain. I don\u0027t want to get it by unfair means, and I didn\u0027t ask for the rate, as you knows.\" \"Well, that will do, Thompson. I wish you well; but take my advice—don\u0027t show too much sympathy for your old associates. The time may soon come when you may be called upon to do your duty towards some of them, and it wont do to be too tender-hearted.\" \"You brute!\" observed the acting warrant-officer, as the lieutenant vanished up the hatchway, \"so that\u0027s your little game, is it? Well, if ever I lays a cat across a fellow-creature\u0027s back, may I never be happy afterward. Them\u0027s my sentiments;\" saying which he walked aft to the doctor, and told him what the first lieutenant had said. Clare was moved into the sick-bay, where he had a better chance of recovery than in the boatswain\u0027s cabin, that place being somewhat close and uncomfortable; but still to offer it showed Thompson\u0027s generous nature, and how willing he was to sacrifice any comfort to serve his friend. Tom mended apace, and when they left Singapore was able to get about; but the doctor kept him upon the sick-list, knowing that the slightest excitement might prove fatal to him. Many of the crew returned to their old habits, and began to use bad language, doubtless encouraged by the example of Cravan, who worried and harrassed them nearly out of their senses. One evening, when the watch below were as usual indulging in a song, he sent forward and ordered them to desist. Now, under ordinary circumstances the command would have been obeyed, but as this was the last of many petty vexatious orders, some of the men rebelled, and one of them continued singing. Upon hearing this Cravan put on his sword, and going forward, attempted to pull the man out from their midst; seeing which his shipmates threw a number of articles at the lieutenant, and compelled him to retreat aft. \"Come, chaps, let\u0027s rise and free ourselves,\" cried the excited sailor; and in a few moments several of the men had secured arms from the steerage, and were collected forward behind a barricade of clothes bags, \u0026c., awaiting the return of the first lieutenant. At this time the watch on deck were at their duty, quite unconscious of the riot below, and, in spite of the bad treatment they had received, few of the original crew joined the disaffected party, although repeatedly urged to do so, and even being threatened when they refused to comply. Cravan walked down to the captain\u0027s cabin, and found Tortle snoring upon a sofa. \"Captain Tortle, the men have mutinied.\" [Pg 198] \"All right—let—\u0027em—flog \u0027em—I\u0027ll do it,\" grunted the drowsy commander. \"But, sir, what shall I do?\" \"Fire among \u0027em! put down the mutiny! Don\u0027t bother me, sir, I\u0027m sick,\" observed the captain in a dignified manner. Finding he could not obtain the support of his superior, Cravan entered the ward-room and consulted with his brother officers, who advised him to reason with the men, when, as they were speaking, they heard the derisive cheers of the mutineers, who had succeeded in obtaining the arms belonging to the Royal Marines, and were shouting to them to come and take them back if they dared. As matters were becoming serious, the first lieutenant requested the officers to put on their swords and go forward with him. When the mutineers saw Cravan they howled with rage, and swore they would serve him out. Thompson arrived from the upper deck just then; and seeing how matters stood, was stepping forward to speak to the foolish fellows, when a marline-spike, thrown by one of the malcontents, struck him, causing his right arm to drop powerless by his side. Without noticing this, the now disgusted acting boatswain rushed forward, and before the mutineers could understand what he was about, had seized the ringleader with his left hand, and dragged him aft to where the officers were standing, upon seeing which the rest of the men gave in, and sued for quarter. \"Put \u0027em all in irons, Mr. Thompson. You have behaved nobly, sir.\" By the time five of the most prominent mutineers were secured, the others, who could not be readily identified, had mingled with their shipmates, and it was deemed best to let them alone. When the last of the malcontents was secured, Mr. Thompson repaired to the surgery, where the doctor examined his arm and pronounced it broken. \"How did you contrive to seize that big fellow with only one hand?\" demanded the surgeon. \"Well, doctor, you see I felt so mad with the fools, knowing they would never get their rights that way, and the sooner they come to their senses the better, that I rushes in and collars big Dick Henston, and afore I knew how much I was hurt, I had hustled him out; but my arm\u0027s mighty painful now, I can tell ye, sir.\" \"You won\u0027t be able to punish the men when they are flogged,\" slyly observed the doctor. \"Thank goodness for that! I\u0027d rather have both my arms broken than use their strength in that way. I\u0027m on the list, ain\u0027t I, sir?\" \"Yes; you had better keep in your cabin for a day or two.\" Thompson felt quite thankful for having been crippled by the mutineers, as he would most assuredly have refused to flog the men had he been so directed. His promotion was through the kindness of one who did not use the lash, and when he accepted the appointment, Jerry little imagined he would ever be called upon to perform such a brutal duty. The morning after the disturbance the five prisoners were brought before the commander, who, after listening to the complaint of the first lieutenant, and refusing to hear more than a few words in explanation from the men, sentenced each of them to receive forty-eight lashes, directing the punishment to take place twenty-four hours after the sentence was passed. At the appointed time the gratings were rigged, and five foolish fellows were duly made more reckless than they were before. Thompson lay upon his bed and watched the countenance of Clare, who was seated by his side, and noticed that as the sailor heard the words \"one! two!\" his lips moved, and it was with great difficulty that he controlled himself. [Pg 199] \"I thought all this devil\u0027s work were over in this ship, Jerry.\" \"So did I, chum, or I\u0027d never ha\u0027 taken the warrant. Why, if any one \u0027ud have said to me, \u0027Thompson, before the ship arrives in England the gratings will be rigged, and the cat laid across one of the Stingers\u0027 backs,\u0027 I should have laughed at \u0027em.\" \"Jerry! did you hear that poor fellow cry out?\" \"Hear him! Ay, Tom, and pity him. Poor devils, they put up with ill-treatment until flesh and blood could stand it no longer, and then, not knowing any better, they mutinied. Lieutenant Cravan worked \u0027em up to it, knowing he had only to keep on long enough, and they\u0027d turn at last, but I was proud to see none of the old hands jined the foolish fellows—But—who are they flogging now? why, he groans awful!\" \"That\u0027s Jack Jones. I can tell his voice. He ain\u0027t a bad man.\" \"He\u0027ll be a devil after this, though, Tom!\" \"Gracious me! why, don\u0027t it seem strange, that here we\u0027ve been for months and months, and never a lash laid on a man, when a few kind words kept all as orderly as possible; now nothing is heard but abuse, and the men gets the same sort of treatment as they did from Captain Puffeigh and Lieutenant Crushe? Well, it can\u0027t last long anyhow, that\u0027s one comfort.\" Under the generous Woodward the good qualities of the men were developed, and all endeavoured to show how anxious they were to please him. Yet in a few weeks all this was changed, and his excellent work undone through the ignorance of two men, who were utterly unfitted to hold command. It may be said that even had the power to flog been out of their hands, they would probably have devised other methods of torture; and a brute will always find some means of revenging himself. But one thing is certain: were the iniquitous custom completely abolished, and the cat-of-nine-tails numbered with the rack and other things of the past, no one would dare revive its use. It is a cruel, savage punishment, degrading to all concerned in its infliction, and there is no excuse for it that man or demon can invent. In the U. S. Navy this degrading practice exists no longer. Congress passed a law which for ever wiped the stain from the stars and stripes, it being therein enacted, \"That in no case shall punishment by flogging be inflicted, nor shall any court-martial adjudge punishment by flogging.\" When the Stinger came to anchor in Simon\u0027s Bay the men were kept close prisoners on board, and, in spite of having a large amount of pay and prize-money due, many of them deserted or attempted to do so, and were brought back. After the ship had been in harbour a few days, Mr. Thompson went on shore, and paid a visit to some of his old friends. His first call was upon Miss Pferdscreptern, he not being aware she had entered the marriage state. Mrs. Schwartz was slumbering in a rocking-chair, while a small tow-headed, sleepy-eyed edition of herself sat blinking, and dozing upon a footstool by her side. The store presented about the same appearance as when he last saw it; but the lovely fraulein had so extended in latitude that the acting boatswain found he had quite lost his reckoning. Advancing with his cap respectfully doffed, Jerry politely inquired if the lady could inform him where Miss Wallbug Pferdscreptern lived. Mrs. Schwartz turned her head and chuckled slightly, whereupon the rolls of fat forming her neck undulated like the folds of a flag when first agitated by the breeze; and opening one eye, she slowly replied, \"She tousant pe here at all now.\" \"Why, when did she die?\" \"She tousant get tead.\" \"Where is she then?\" [Pg 200] \"For why does you ask?\" \"Well, you see, marm,\" replied the somewhat puzzled acting warrant-officer, \"I knows a great friend of hers named Jerry Thompson, and he has axed me to look her up, and tell her all about him.\" \"No, you tousant know Sherry Thompson. He\u0027s tead, and his drue love marry ein odder man,\" observed the obese lady in a dreamy sort of manner. \"Well, never mind about his being dead; I wants to see his old friend, so please mum, I\u0027d thank ye kindly if you\u0027ll give me her directions.\" \"I\u0027m vas Wallburg Pferdscreptern, but vas marry to Captain Schwartz.\" \"You—Wall—bug?\" \"Yaw, I\u0027m vas her.\" \"Well, hang me if I can see a liniment of her face in yours, mum. I\u0027m Jerry Thompson.\" Mrs. Schwartz managed after a great effort to produce an incredulous sort of chuckle. \"Don\u0027t you believe it, mum?\" Slightly roused, the lady bubbled off a laugh, which started in her throat and seemed to die away in her slippers, then turned her pumpkin-like visage towards him, and slowly ejaculated, \"I tousant believe ein vord of vot you spoke.\" \"Well, mum, they says, absence makes the heart grow fonder, isle of beauty, fare thee well; but I must observe that any little weakness as you may have felt for me I am happy to see is quite vanished. Good-day, mum.\" \"Stop, mine friend! vill you trink some schnapps?\" Jerry was about to decline the offer, but, thinking it might be considered impolite, he seated himself upon a bag of coffee, and, knowing the lady objected to long sentences, nodded an assent to her proposition. Having filled two glasses, Mrs. Schwartz motioned to Thompson to take one; then, without more ceremony, observed, \"My love to you,\" and in a moment set the glass down empty. \"God bless me!\" ejaculated her visitor. \"Yaw, yaw! Gott pless you, mein friend!\" Jerry advanced to the unwieldy form, and, holding out his hand, exclaimed—\"Well, I thought to find you altered, but \u0027pon my word, my dear marm, you puzzles me—and that \u0027ere little kid, I supposes it\u0027s yourn?\" \"Yaw, dat is mine kind.\" \"Well, mum, I must say adoo, and can\u0027t say I feels any sentiment of affection a-knocking in my bosom when I looks at you, but I\u0027m Jerry Thompson, although you don\u0027t know me.\" \"Mine friend,\" replied the frau, in measured tones, \"you tousant hombogs me like that. Scherry was ein handsome man, and ein deal petter-looking than ever you vos pe.\" \"Possible, mum, werry possible; I never was considered striking in that line—adoo, mum—may you be happy,\" cheerfully remarked the unabashed fellow, who then left the store, muttering, \"From all such as she, O Lord, deliver me;\" and in a short time found one of his old acquaintances, who invited him to dine with him that evening. Mr. Tomson had made the acting boatswain\u0027s acquaintance when the latter was living on shore with his old commander, they having formed a sort of[Pg 201] friendship on account of the similarity of their names, and since they last met both had prospered in the world. After strolling about the place until four o\u0027clock, Thompson returned to his namesake\u0027s store, and shortly afterwards was driven by him to his residence, where he was welcomed by his friend\u0027s wife, and two charming children. \"We often used to talk about you, and were right sorry to hear you were killed,\" observed the lady. \"Thankee, mam, for your kind feelings—but really I didn\u0027t deserve them, as I have never written to you, although I promised to do so.\" \"Your old sweetheart is married! Do you know that?\" \"Yes, mam, I called to see her this morning, and, would you believe it? she said I wasn\u0027t myself, and that Scherry Thompson (as if I were named arter sherry wine) were a deal handsomer man than ever I had been—ha! ha! ha!\" \"That was scarcely polite of her, Mr. Thompson.\" \"Well, she didn\u0027t know me, for she spoke very kindly about me, evidently thinking of me as dead.\" Thompson amused his friends by relating some of his adventures, and they enjoyed his company immensely, when about ten o\u0027clock a servant brought in a card, and saying it was for the sailor gentleman, and a gentleman was waiting for an answer, tittered and retired from the room. Jerry, who had just commenced a song, apologized to his friends, and perused the card, which ran thus:— Captain Max Schwartz, late Hans Jacob Pferdscreptern, Ship Chandler, Licensed to sell Wine and Spirits wholesale and retail. N. B. M. S. boards all the shipping upon their entrance into the harbour. Having read the foregoing, Thompson glanced at his friends, who were laughing most immoderately, and observed, \"What does it mean?\" \"Why, it\u0027s a visit from Max Schwartz,\" replied the lady, somewhat recovering from her merriment. \"Shall I ask him in?\" \"Certainly, certainly. He is an honest sort of man, and very German.\" Jerry walked into the hall, where he encountered the gigantic form of Captain Schwartz, who, looking at him in an absent manner, mildly demanded, \"Is you Scherry Thompson?\" \"Yaw, yaw, mine-ear,\" bawled the acting boatswain, as if hailing some one in the attic. \"What you want, mine-ear? Won\u0027t you come in?\" Captain Schwartz fumbled in his coat pocket, and bringing out another card, gravely handed it to him, and exclaimed, \"I schust vants zadisfaction.\" \"Satisfaction?\" \"Yaw; zadisfaction! I sbeaks blain, doesn\u0027t I?\" At this juncture the host came forward and invited the captain to go into the parlour, and take a drink, but the gigantic Schwartz would not move, declaring he wanted satisfaction, and not schnapps. [Pg 202] \"Well, what sort of satisfaction do you require, and what do you want it for?\" \"I vant zadisfaction for you to go und make love to mine vrow. Yah, dat ish vot I vonts zadisfaction for,\" observed the burly Teuton. Upon hearing this Jerry burst out into a loud laugh, in which his friends joined, and for some time he could not reply to the imperturbable Schwartz, who gazed on the party in a most calm and indifferent manner. At last, however, his host addressed the man in German, and demanded to know why he had thus intruded upon their privacy and disturbed his guest; upon which the big one replied in a deep, monotonous voice, \"Vell, you see, mine friend, I vos ashleep in mine ped ven Hansen mine broder gomes in, and dells me tere vash un matrose make loves to mine vrow, so I gets up, and beeps between ein knot hole in mein store, and zees mein vrow trink schnapps mit der Scherry, und den I goes and takes a trink mit Hansen, and we talks it over until he tinks I must have zadisfaction, so I takes ein Doitch book and reads, tat I has to call upon mine enemy and temand zadisfaction, and so I vound him out and comes up here.\" \"Well, now you had better go back again,\" observed the acting boatswain in a jocular manner. \"I\u0027m laid up, can\u0027t you see, and don\u0027t want to fight about a woman who ain\u0027t nothing to me. Besides, you might get injured, which would be a pity.\" The captain did not deign to reply: but drawing two ancient-looking flint-lock horse pistols from the depths of his capacious pocket, and producing a couple of bullets, and a tin canister of sporting powder, gravely placed them on a table near him, and waited for an answer to his challenge. Seeing his host was about to interfere, Jerry begged to be allowed to settle the matter himself; and bidding his hostess not alarm herself, walked towards the table, and taking up one of the pistols between his finger and thumb, coolly inquired of the placid German if it were his property. \"Yah, it ish.\" \"Well, then,\" exclaimed the now annoyed acting warrant-officer, throwing the pistol through the window, and rapidly sending the other after it; \"now, my lyebeer fryend, make sail, or with my friend\u0027s permission I\u0027ll put you off the premises.\" Captain Schwartz gravely picked up the bullets and powder, which he carefully placed in one of his pockets, then advancing towards Mr. Thompson, held out his hand and said he \"vas zadisfied.\" Hearing this, the master of the house invited him to take some liquid refreshment, which offer was promptly accepted. When the husband of Wallburg became a little animated by the good liquor he imbibed, Jerry again inquired what prompted him to bring the pistols, to which the captain replied, \"Vell, Scherry, mine friend, ven I looks in the Doitcher book, I vind it says ven a man vants zadisfaction, he pest get it by calling on his enemy und offering him schoice of arms, zo I kets down ter bistols of mine vrow\u0027s vater, und as I knowed, you see, der bistols vould be no goots mitout ter powder and balls, I shust brings tem, according to what is says in ter book; and,\" added the captain, with a grave shake of the head, \"ter book vas right, you see, for I\u0027ve got zadisfaction;\" saying which he arose, and nodding solemnly to the party, stalked out of the room. \"Is that the Cape style of getting satisfaction, friend Tomson?\" demanded Jerry. \"Possibly,\" laughed his friend. \"The captain is contented, and so you may laugh at him. But what is that? Why, as I live, Schwartz is hunting for his pistols in our[Pg 203] garden. Well, he\u0027s a harmless fellow, and evidently thought if he followed the book he would be doing the correct sort of thing under the circumstances.\" Thompson bade his kind entertainers good-bye, and proceeded on board his ship, and the next day told Clare of his adventure; but by some means Tom seemed to imagine that Jerry had been up to his old tricks, and consequently Mr. Schwartz had good grounds for challenging him. \"I don\u0027t understand you, Jerry. First you say that the girl didn\u0027t know you, and then that her husband wanted to fight you because you made love to her.\" \"Them\u0027s the facts, Tom, old man.\" \"Why, how could he be jealous if she didn\u0027t know you?\" \"Why, you see, this is how the case stands. Captain Schwartz is a man who wants a good deal of time to calculate in.
