{"id":28899,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER XXVI.","content":"A few days before the ship\u0027s departure for home, a rumour was circulated on board that some relatives of the commander were to embark as passengers, and the report was confirmed by the carpenters being directed to put up temporary sleeping accommodation in the captain\u0027s cabin for a lady and gentleman, their female servant, and two little girls. \n \n The acting boatswain was delighted to hear that a lady was coming on board, thinking Captain Tortle would, under such circumstances, abstain from inflicting any severe punishment upon his crew, and he knew her presence would in many ways ameliorate the condition of the men. He also had some curiosity to see what sort of person the servant was; for it must be confessed that although Jerry had not forgotten A-tae, he was beginning to yearn after another affinity. We do not wish to imply by this that he desired to slight Mary Ann, although probably he did not feel particularly anxious to meet her. He knew that he had promised to make her his wife upon his return, so, thinking that without doubt she had waited for him, he was determined to keep his word; but he somewhat resented what he called her silence, never imagining it resulted from his own inattention, and objected to her having written to him in poetry, \"as if she couldn\u0027t write him a letter, instead of sending that stuff.\" It was in this spirit he anticipated the arrival of the female servant, and he determined to enjoy his freedom while he could, thinking that once Mary Ann was Mrs. Thompson all such luxuries as affinities would be simply out of the question. Jerry was fast returning to his former general devotion to the fair sex, and, as Clare observed, \"would require a deal of looking arter for the future.\" \n \n About nine o\u0027clock on the morning of departure, Captain Tortle proceeded on shore to fetch the party, and it being rather a boisterous day, the lady was afraid to venture in the gig, so the captain politely brought her off in the pinnace, a boatswain\u0027s chair being slung from the main yard, in which she was safely lifted on board without having to climb the gangway ladder. \n \n Mr. Thompson was standing by the starboard companion when the boat arrived alongside, and although on the sick-list, he gave an eye to the rigging of the chair. Everything being adjusted, and the lady comfortably lashed in the apparatus, a boatswain\u0027s mate piped \"hoist away,\" and in a few moments the chair rose from the pinnace, freighted with a lady in whose lap was seated a most beautiful little girl, who, instead of betraying fear at her novel position, laughed and kicked her feet about, only seeming concerned when she found herself safely landed upon the deck. The lady being released from the chair, it was again hoisted up and lowered into the boat alongside, from which it once more emerged, bearing a smart-looking French bonne, who was tightly clutching a blue-eyed baby; and although the latter did not cry, it evidently anything but enjoyed the hoisting process. \n \n Mademoiselle Adèle, glanced timidly down upon the deck, and seeing Mr. Thompson with his arm in a sling, naturally supposed he was \"un brave,\" and determined to captivate his heart, thinking how nice it would be to recline her head upon his manly bosom, and how all her friends would envy her the possession of \"un officier de marine;\"[Pg 205] but the young woman\u0027s thoughts were brought to a somewhat abrupt conclusion by the men at the fall slacking away too rapidly, and Adèle landed upon the deck with something very like a bump, which for a moment knocked all the romance out of her, and caused her charge to scream in energetic protest. \n \n As the bonne was being released from the chair, her employer, Major Barron, walked over the gangway, followed by Captain Tortle, who went aft and welcomed the lady to his ship; and in a few moments they were all below, praising the accommodation, and thanking their relation for his kindness in giving up so much of his cabin for their comfort. The major had been out in Africa for some years, but, having lately inherited a large estate in Kent, was returning to live upon his property, as a country gentleman should. He had delayed his departure from Simon\u0027s Town, knowing that his cousin, Captain Tortle, would touch there in the Stinger on his way home from China, and under the circumstances the admiral had politely given him special permission to embark on board his relative\u0027s ship. \n \n Mrs. Barron was a gentle being, thoroughly devoted to her husband and children, and beloved by all who knew her, while her eldest daughter, a little darling between three and four years of age, requires something more than a brief description. A most graceful child was Miss Barbara, with a dazzling complexion, which presented a charming contrast to her dark expressive eyes; the latter seeming to search into yours with mischievous intent, and to win your affection at a glance. Her dimpled cheeks, tinged with the healthy glow of childhood, were the admiration of every one who beheld her; while her pretty rosebud of a mouth was ever ready to pout in pretended seriousness, or arrange itself for the receipt of a kiss. These charms, crowned as they were by a mass of fair curly hair, in connection with a naturally naive manner, made this baby a being to be loved, and petted; and all the officers and crew were, upon beholding her, immediately converted into ardent admirers. \n \n Having surveyed their new quarters, the major and his wife returned to the quarter-deck, and amused themselves by watching the arrival of their baggage. Mrs. Barron seated herself upon a chair brought up for her use, and took her youngest daughter in her lap, in order that Adèle, the bonne, might be free to direct which packages were required to be placed in the cabin, while Miss Barbara begged leave to be allowed to talk with Mr. Thompson, whom she termed, in her own charmingly-original language, \"the man with the curly eye.\" As Jerry smiled upon her, and watched her every movement in a most admiring manner, Mrs. Barron gave the required permission, and the child walked half-way towards him, pretended to look shyly upon the deck, raised her bright eyes, lowered them again,—then, with a merry little laugh, rushed to the acting boatswain, who had knelt to receive her, and throwing her arms round his neck, hugged him as if he had been an old friend. \n \n As the baggage was being moved about the deck, and it was possible the child might get in the way, Thompson took her upon his left arm and walked over to the port side, where he seated himself upon a shot-box. Having slid down upon his knee, the little pet carefully smoothed her ruffled garments; then, with a mingled expression of delight and coquetry, looked up in his face, and said, \"How do you do, sir?\" \n \n \"Werry well, thankee, miss. Why, you\u0027re as pretty as a pictur. What\u0027s your name, missy?\" \n \n The artful little monkey knew she had made an impression, so she bashfully inclined her head, and murmured \"Cops.\" \n \n \"Cops, you beauty! Why, that ain\u0027t a name, is it?\" \n \n \"No,\" exclaimed the cherub, shaking her head, as if to say, \"Now, don\u0027t you want to know all about me?\" \n \n [Pg 206] \n \n \"It\u0027s a purser\u0027s name, ain\u0027t it pretty?\" \n \n \"No,\" continued the wide-awake one, not exactly knowing the meaning of the word, yet almost guessing its import. \"I call my-self Cops.\" \n \n \"Do you, beauty? Well, any name is nice that you are called by. But what is your regular name?\" \n \n \"Barbara Barron,\" demurely whispered the infant, playing with Mr. Thompson\u0027s gold chain as she spoke. \"My name is Barbara Barron, but I call my-self Cops.\" \n \n \"You\u0027re the prettiest darling I ever saw,\" declared her admirer. \"You\u0027re as beautiful as a fairy. I\u0027ll do anything for you.\" \n \n At this moment her papa came on deck, and seeing her seated upon Mr. Thompson\u0027s knee, pointed her out to the captain, observing, \"There\u0027s Barbara captivating the boatswain; oh, that baby, never happy but when receiving attention from the other sex.\" But Tortle, who considered children rather a bore, merely observed that the boatswain would take good care of her, and took no further notice of the little darling. \n \n Seeing her father, the young lady inquired if her parrot had come on board, upon which Thompson asked her what the bird was like. \n \n Cops looked at him with a very serious air, as if about to impart a fearful secret, then taking his whiskers she tied them under his chin, untied them again, gazed earnestly into his eyes, and replied, \"Ye-es. It\u0027s a grey one, with square blue eyes, pink nose, green feet, yellow tail, and gold ear-rings;\" and added, her bright eyes extending with animation, \"It will bite you off if you are a naughty boy, mamma says so.\" \n \n \"Will it, miss? Now don\u0027t say so. I\u0027ll be a werry good boy, and then it will leave me alone. But where are you going to keep it?\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know,\" helplessly replied his enchantress. \"Won\u0027t you keep it in your house, and let it live with you, and I\u0027ll come and see it?\" \n \n The bird was just then brought over the side, and Cops pointed it out to her friend. \n \n \"Is that your polly, darling?\" \n \n \"Ye-es. Oh, don\u0027t he shiver? he\u0027s ill.\" \n \n Thompson advanced, and told the sailor who was carrying it forward to take it down to his cabin, where, much to Miss Barbara\u0027s delight, it was duly installed in a place of honour just over the acting warrant-officer\u0027s table, from which elevated position it could throw its food and flirt its water over his head and down his neck as he sat at meals; but what cared he for that? to please such a child he would willingly have roomed with an alligator. \n \n When the bird had been fed and received its instructions from its mistress, Cops ordered her slave to carry her up stairs, which he accordingly did in a most submissive manner: and upon their reaching the top of the ladder, were accosted by the bonne, who had evidently been searching for the child, and was somewhat out of temper. \n \n \"Oh, mon Dieu! Mademoiselle que vous êtes nottey!\" \n \n \"No, she ain\u0027t naughty,\" replied Jerry, who was exceedingly indignant at the charge. \"She\u0027s as good as gold.\" \n \n \"Eff you zay zo, sare, I it belief!\" exclaimed the bonne, darting a look of unmistakable admiration at the last speaker. \"You are trop good not to say vat is not ze trof;\" saying which she bade the child kiss her hand to her good friend, and darting another killing glance at the acting boatswain, seized Miss Cops, said, \"Good-bye, sare,\" upon her own account, and disappeared below with her charge. \n \n \"Oh,\" mused Jerry, \"that\u0027s it, is it, Miss Polly-wo-frunkzay? Well, I can\u0027t make love to you before such a beautiful angel as that baby is; besides, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s right. Being an engaged man, it ain\u0027t correct for me to make love to French gals.\" It will be[Pg 207] seen by this that Mr. Thompson changed his ideas, as some do their political opinions, to suit the circumstances of the case. \n \n By noon, everything being quite ready, the Stinger saluted the admiral\u0027s flag, and, having steamed through False Bay, made sail for home, all bidding adieu to Africa without the slightest regret. \n \n About five o\u0027clock that evening the ship was bowling along under close-reefed topsails, and Mrs. Barron and Adèle were both confined to their cabins by sea-sickness, thus giving Miss Cops an opportunity of visiting her new friend, which probably she would not otherwise have enjoyed. Before she left the cabin the child fished out a toy-basket which she had brought on board in her hand, and after giving it a good shake, to ascertain if its contents were safe, she knocked at the outer door of the cabin until the sentry heard her and let her out; then she proceeded into the steerage; and presented herself at the door of the acting boatswain\u0027s cabin, which she found closed. \n \n Mr. Thompson had invited his friend Clare to tea with him; and when Barbara arrived at the door they were busily discussing the merits of a tin of sardines, termed by them \"Sardinians,\" and Jerry was in the midst of an explanation, when they heard a knock at the door, upon which Tom laid his hand upon his friend\u0027s sleeve, and said, \"Hush! there\u0027s some one calling Jerry.\" \n \n \"I expect it\u0027s little Cops,\" replied Thompson, picking out a grain of Indian-corn which had just been dropped into the sardines by the parrot. \n \n \"Jer-ry!\" again exclaimed the impatient child, who, now hearing her friend\u0027s voice, applied her boots to the pannel right vigorously, \"I want to come in.\" \n \n Thompson laid down his fork, slid the door back, and beheld his little friend, who, without more ceremony, walked into the cabin, climbed upon his knee, and, pointing to Clare, asked \"if he were his father?\" \n \n \"No, Miss, he\u0027s my chum.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m his old friend, Miss, and has got a little boy about your age,\" observed Tom, who had seen the child before. \n \n Barbara pretended not to care about Clare\u0027s boy, yet asked a dozen questions concerning him; the fact was, Cop had a weakness for boys, whom she considered as being specially created for her amusement. So well known was she at the Cape, that none of her young gentlemen friends would submit to her tyrannical friendship, she regarding them as slaves, who were to be petted or slapped as the whim of the moment prompted her, a course of treatment many of her older friends submitted to with great equanimity. \n \n After partaking of some biscuit and sardines, the child produced her basket, and begging her friends not to tell any one about it, opened the lid, when out tumbled a much-ruffled monkey, seeing which Barbara laughed and clapped her hands, whereupon the animal sat up, stretched out one leg, scratched itself, and looked up at the beams, and when the attention of those present was attracted in that direction, quietly put his hind leg in the basin near him, and grasped a lump of sugar, which he deftly conveyed to his mouth, unobserved by any one but the child, who was perfectly frantic with delight over his achievement. \n \n When her merriment had somewhat abated, Cops, with wide-open eyes and expressive action of forefinger, solemnly enjoined her friends not to tell \"no one\" about her monkey, as papa and mamma thought she had left it behind her. \n \n \"Is it such a dreadful secret, that the monkey can\u0027t go on deck?\" observed Tom, who began to think his friend had enough live stock in his cabin, his hair being by that time pretty well decorated with rejected Indian corn rinds. \"Don\u0027t you think it would be better to let him live in the pinnace, miss?\" \n \n [Pg 208] \n \n \"No,\" gravely replied the child, \"it mustn\u0027t live not nowhere but here, or he\u0027ll die, and the blume mouse will come for you.\" \n \n Barbara believed in a highly-decorative lot of bogeys, but was, while constantly threatening others with their visits, herself perfectly indifferent to them. Jerry listened to the child with rapt attention, and pretended to credit every word she uttered; seeing which Cops enlarged upon the blue rodent question until Clare began to imagine she was slightly touched in the brain, he never having before met with an infant who possessed such wonderful imaginative power. \n \n \"Is she all right there?\" observed Tom, touching the back of her curly hair with his forefinger. \n \n \"Right! I should rather say she is,\" replied her champion. \"Why, she\u0027s as smart as lightning; and what you think is nonsense is real downright cleverness, a deal beyond the understanding of you and I. Why, she can speak French; can\u0027t you, pretty?\" \n \n \"Oui monsieur,\" archly replied the young lady. \n \n By this time the monkey began to revive, the sugar which it had freely purloined having acted us a powerful restorative; and when the child declared she must go, it leaped upon her shoulder, and snicking its sharp little teeth, offered a determined resistance; whereupon Clare cleverly manufactured a leathern belt, which he fastened round the animal\u0027s waist, and having secured it with the chain of Thompson\u0027s old call, he drove a nail in a beam; then taking the wriggling creature from the child\u0027s shoulder, deposited it upon a shelf where Jerry usually kept his books and other treasures. \n \n As the monkey landed overhead, the marine sentry on duty before the door of the captain\u0027s cabin left his post and walked forward, being directed by Tortle \"to find out that child and to bring her aft;\" and hearing her voice in the boatswain\u0027s cabin, he put his head inside the door and told Cops \"that her mar wanted her,\" upon which the pretty creature kissed Mr. Thompson, blew a similar favour to Clare and the monkey, and having heard her parrot say \"Good-night,\" trotted aft, and was soon afterwards undressed by the drowsy Adèle, who was half-dead with sea-sickness. \n \n After they had been at sea a few days the weather moderated, and the remainder of the voyage was remarkable for its uniformly fine weather. Miss Adèle recovered from her sea-sickness and managed to get about; and the midshipmen took every opportunity of improving their knowledge of the French language by conversing with her. Now, although this flattered the bonne exceedingly, still it was not the attention she wanted; and the sprightly girl was somewhat chagrined by her failure in regard to Mr. Thompson, who avoided her in every possible manner. At last, one afternoon, when the men were at cutlass-drill upon the quarter-deck, Miss Adèle sauntered forward to the acting boatswain\u0027s cabin, and seeing him engaged in examining a pair of trousers, boldly advanced, and addressed him. \n \n \"Monsieur Thompe-sonne, how you do you do to-day?\" \n \n Jerry whistled softly, and pretended not to hear her, upon which she stood in his light, and, smiling on him, repeated the question. \n \n \"Ah! how-de-do, may-dam-moselle?\" \n \n \"Monsieur Thompe-sonne, will you please be so kind as to tell me vare my malle—my tronke is?\" \n \n Jerry looked at his garment, then glanced at the speaker, as much as to imply that he thought her very bold to speak to him when he was engaged in such a business; and, touching his injured arm, informed her that he was on the sick-list. \n \n \"Oh, are you sicke, poor theeng? I am varrai sorry. Vill you allow me to attend to you? I vill soon your arm make vell.\" \n \n [Pg 209] \n \n Jerry got up, meditating a bolt forward, but the bonne was too clever for him; as upon his rising she placed a hand upon each side of the door, and looking at him in a most affectionate manner, softly repeated, \"I am varrai sorry.\" \n \n Adèle was dressed in a most killing costume, and the effect of her speaking grey eyes upon his susceptible heart resembled that of the sun upon ice; so Jerry stuffed the garment he was holding into his chest, and, approaching her politely, yet half reluctantly, begged she would withdraw, observing that ladies wern\u0027t allowed forward. \n \n Seeing that he feared she would get herself in trouble with her mistress, the bonne altered her tactics, and with a sweet smile declared she had no intention of entering his cabin, but that all she required was the loan of a chair; upon hearing which Mr. Thompson lifted out the best one he possessed, and having dusted it, motioned her to take it, after which he retired to his den. \n \n Miss Adèle took out some knitting, and placing the chair exactly opposite the acting boatswain\u0027s cabin, worked away like a machine, much to the admiration of a group of marines, who were watching her proceedings with the greatest attention. The bonne did not lack admirers, as she well knew; but the man she almost worshipped, \"the charming Monsieur Thompesonne,\" was unkind to her. \n \n Finding she meant to blockade him, Jerry turned his attention to cleaning the animals, when the quick eye of the French girl discovered the monkey, and she determined to thaw her cold idol by threatening him with exposing the child\u0027s secret; so she started, and exclaimed with an affected little scream, \"Oh, Monsieur Thompe-sonne! vare deed you get zat monquai?\" \n \n \"It\u0027s mine, miss; I\u0027ve had it a long time,\" he coolly replied. \n \n Adèle got up, walked to the cabin door, surveyed the animal with a slightly contemptuous air, and observed, \"Zat is Meece Barbe\u0027s monquai.\" \n \n \"Oh no, it ain\u0027t; it ain\u0027t the little gal\u0027s; it\u0027s mine.\" \n \n \"Oh no. Monsieur, I know zat monquai; it my fingare bited too many times. Her papa zay it vas to be kill, but one leetle niggare boy he zave it, and now meece hide it here—I must tell her papa of it.\" \n \n \"For goodness\u0027 sake, don\u0027t do that!\" whispered the fellow, quite forgetting in his anxiety to shield his favourite from trouble, that probably her papa only deprived his child of her plaything because he thought it could not be accommodated on board. \"Oh, please don\u0027t tell on the pretty baby.\" \n \n Adèle walked into the cabin, gazed almost fiercely in his face, and exclaimed, \"Vy should I hold my tongue? you do not care for me. Vy should I do so for zo meece?\" \n \n \"Phew!\" whistled Jerry, seeing in a moment what the girl meant. \"Why, my dear may-dam-mosselle, I\u0027ll do anything to please you, if you won\u0027t split about the monkey.\" \n \n \"I do not vant to spleet ze monquai—mais I vant ze leetle politeness from yourself, Monsieur Thompe-sonne. Do you like me? No! Ees it zat I am zo uglee donc!\" \n \n \"Lord bless you, miss, I\u0027m in a perfect fever about you. But please get out of my cabin, the engineers are a-looking over here, and making fun of us.\" \n \n \"Pah! what you care for zengeneers! If zey laugh, you can blow zem viz ze boxe; you are brave. Vous êtes un vrai Hercule!\" \n \n \"Anything you like, miss, if you\u0027ll only get out of my cabin.\" \n \n \"Monsieur Thompe-sonne,\" cried the girl, now thoroughly roused, and indifferent to any consequences to herself or the man she admired, \"Ger-rrr-ai, do you lofe me?\" \n \n \"Lord bless you, miss, I adore you; but do, if you please, get out of my cabin.\" \n \n [Pg 210] \n \n After much persuasion she finally left his presence, but not until she had extorted from him the word \"yes,\" in reply to her inquiry, \"Do you lofe me?\" It appeared that she had, from some French novel, taken the idea that all the English law required was the repeating of the word \"yes\" on the part of the man; evidently the author must have taken a passage from the marriage service and introduced it in his story as \"a manner and custom of the John Boule,\" as after Jerry had said that word she became as submissive as a slave, and that evening told her mistress, in great confidence, \"zat she was going to be married to ze brave Monsieur Thompe-sonne as soon as zey arrived.\" \n \n As the time passed Miss Barbara became known to all the crew, and it was a sight that would have moved a misanthrope to see the pretty infant tyrannizing over the men in her tiny way. As to Thompson, he was her slave, and poured out the choicest treasures he possessed for her amusement, it being nothing uncommon to see Cops sitting upon the image of the God Buddha, and nursing the God Fo, whom she called \"a nice fat little boy,\" while an admiring crowd of sailors watched her footsteps, and removed every rope yarn from her path whenever she honoured them by extending her promenade round the forecastle. \n \n Jerry was exceedingly particular how he treated the bonne; in fact, upon all occasions he what the Irish term \"blarnied\" her, in order that she might keep Miss Cop\u0027s secret; while she, imagining he was lawfully engaged to marry her according to English custom, gave him a little latitude, and overlooked many small offences which otherwise she would have resented. \n \n \"Upon my word, you get more beautiful every day,\" he observed to Adèle one morning when she brought Cops forward to feed her bird. \"I wonder how it is you haven\u0027t got married before this?\" \n \n \"Oh, cher Ger-r-r-r-ai, I vait for you. I know alway zat you live some-me-ware in ze world.\" \n \n \"Did you, miss? Ah! I see. You\u0027re one of them what\u0027s-his-names wot believe in having another of the opposite sex always a cruising about in search of them. I\u0027ve never come across one of your speecee before. How do you like it?\" \n \n \"Oh, I lof you, Ger-r-r-r-ai, and vot do I vant more?\" replied the girl, darting a sentimental glance at him over her shoulder as she walked away. \n \n \"A deal that you won\u0027t get, I reckon,\" quietly observed the acting warrant-officer, as he watched her across the steerage. \"I\u0027ll keep on at this game until you lands, and then adoo to polly-woo-frunkse; there\u0027s too much of the rile tiger about your style to suit me.\" \n \n One afternoon, as the ship was running as upright as a dart, Cops was permitted to go forward as far as the booms, and of course was attended by her friend; and as this was to be his last day on the list, he had devoted nearly the whole of it to the child. After telling her some marvellous stories, which the clever \"dot\" perfectly understood, he told her what the guns said at Canton, and invented a new speech for each piece, Jerry being never tired of talking to her; when suddenly she declared, she was weary, and made him sit down upon a shot box while she told him a story; seeing which a number of men who were lying upon the deck got up and watched the child, as if they could have worshipped her. \n \n \"Who is those men?\" inquired the little autocrat, pointing to the sailors. \"May I play with them?\" \n \n The captain and first lieutenant being below, and the men off watch, Thompson thought it would be no harm to indulge his idol, so the sailors were informed they might approach the child, upon which she assumed a severe expression of face and sent[Pg 211] them all in the corner, while she plundered her attendant of his silk handkerchief, which she wrapped round a gun-chock and carefully nursed in her lap. After having amused herself for some time, she made them all sit in a circle, then with bated breath told them of the \"blume\" mouse. \n \n The sailors looked at each other and laughed, upon which, thinking they were not sufficiently attentive, she ordered them all out of her house, and having sent her only love, Jerry, into the corner, drew the handkerchief more tightly round the gun-chock, and bade her baby go to sleep before the mouse came out of the gun. Thompson stood with his face to the ship\u0027s side, looking in Barbara\u0027s eyes, the very perfection of a naughty boy, when suddenly a hand was laid upon her shoulder, and she heard the voice of Captain Tortle, who roughly told her to go below, as mamma wanted her. \n \n Now, Miss Barbara was an exceedingly dignified child; and Tortle having addressed her as youngster, she pretended not to have heard his speech, but proceeded to scold her naughty boy, who, unmindful of the commander\u0027s presence, was still \"in the corner.\" \n \n \"Hush, sir!\" she observed, when the captain again spoke to her, and added, looking up in his face,—her eyes dilated with excitement,—\"Don\u0027t you see my baby is asleep? I\u0027m samed of you!\" \n \n Hearing this, Tortle, who could not appreciate the pretty little comedy, rudely picked up the child, and carried her down to the cabin; and, upon stooping to ask her for a kiss, received a severe smack on the face from the indignant little lady, who immediately afterwards wisely sought refuge in the folds of her mamma\u0027s dress, where she indulged in a good cry. \n \n Tortle rubbed his face with his handkerchief, and pretended to be amused, while he inwardly vowed he would never touch her again. Poor baby! \u0027twas very thoughtless of him to wake her so suddenly from her dream of pleasure, and he fully deserved the blow she gave him. Upon seeing her sister in tears, Marie, the younger one, joined in the out-burst, and cried \"Go away\" to the naughty captain, who thereupon beat a retreat to the upper deck. \n \n When their grief was somewhat abated, their gentle mother, with solemn voice, told them how wrong it was for a little girl to do such a sad unladylike act as to smack the captain, and how she feared that Barbara would never become an angel if she did not alter her behaviour,—upon which the darling naively declared she would rather be Cops and smack him again than be an angel and not do it. This irreverent reply so shocked her mother that she reported the circumstance to her papa, who thereupon seized the infant, and smothered her in kisses; when the artful puss, finding him in a good humour, proceeded to tell him about her monkey, and how kind dear, dear Thompson had been. Adèle heard this, and did not feel pleased with the disclosure, but comforted herself with Jerry\u0027s having said yes, and looked forward to becoming \"Mrs. Thompe-sonne\" with as much confidence as ever. \n \n The day after this Mrs. Barron had an opportunity of speaking to the acting boatswain, who, almost against the wish of the doctor, was now once more on duty, and after a little conversation she sounded him about Adèle. \n \n \"Why, bless your heart, mam, I don\u0027t mean anything to the young woman,\" and then he told her all about her threat of exposing the presence of the monkey, softening it down, however, as much as possible, and blaming his own dull head more than the girl\u0027s foolishness. \n \n \"You\u0027re not married, are you, Mr. Thompson?\" \n \n \"Me, mam? what makes you think that?\" \n \n \"Why, I have heard you mention your little boy.\" \n \n [Pg 212] \n \n \"Do you know Clare, mam? Tom, we calls him, Miss Cops knows him,\" he added, smiling at the child, who was seated on his arm. \"Well, mam, that poor fellow has a wife and a child and I\u0027ve a life-interest in their baby, that is, if poor Tom don\u0027t live, I shall help bring him up, as I knows if he dies his wife won\u0027t be long a follerin\u0027 of him, as they loves each other truly and dearly.\" \n \n \"Why, you cannot attend to the boy when you are at sea, can you, Mr. Thompson?\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t mean to foller the sea any longer. I\u0027ve a poor old mother who is in an almshouse, and I\u0027m going to take her out and stay by her in future; and then if anything occurs to poor Tom and his wife, I can take the boy home with me.\" \n \n \"Where does your mother reside?\" \n \n \"At Nonnington, Kent, mam. I was born there.\" \n \n \"Why, that is near my husband\u0027s estate; I must talk to him about you.\" \n \n That evening the major sent for Mr. Thompson, having first obtained full particulars about the acting-warrant from the captain and doctor, the latter gentleman being a great friend of his. After putting a few questions to Jerry, he informed him that he had determined to pension off the steward now managing his estate, as he knew he was too old to agree with his ideas as to its future government, and that having observed Mr. Thompson was gifted with great tact and had a way which pleased him, he would give him a house and garden rent free, with coal and wood, and a salary of eighty pounds for the first year, if he would in return give all his time and best services to him as steward, adding, \"I know you will quickly learn what is necessary, and will suit me far better than a man who has been brought up to the business.\" \n \n Jerry stood quite dumbfounded for a moment, then in a few words thanked his benefactor, adding, as if that thought were uppermost, \"I shall often be able to see your little daughter, which pleases me as much as anything.\" \n \n Great was Miss Barbara\u0027s joy when she heard that her friend was to live near them on shore, and she immediately suggested to her papa the propriety of building a sugar-candy house for Mr. Thompson\u0027s mother, which proposition her father gravely promised to take into consideration. \n \n Tom Clare was delighted with his friend\u0027s good fortune, little thinking that he intended to share it with him; but when they chatted it over that evening, Jerry offered Tom a home in his house, saying, the country air and the society of his wife would soon bring him round. Visions of happy tea-parties under the trees in the orchard, for Thompson knew his future home well, and of little Tom learning to be a farmer, while Polly was to milk the cows, and Clare to see after the flower garden; these pleasant thoughts busied the friends until they heard a cry along the decks of \"light on our starboard bow,\" and they knew that they had once more arrived off their native land. Upon going on deck, they saw the Start light blinking across the water, and Jerry pressed his friend\u0027s thin hand, and laughingly observed that in a few days they would be on the right side of that light. \n \n Clare soon after this went forward, and Mr. Thompson was left to his own thoughts, but in a few moments he became aware that Adèle was standing near him, and to his surprise found she was weeping. \n \n \"Oh, Monsieur Thompe-sonne, how could you trifle vith me like zat you have did? I lofe you so mooche, and you zay to madame you do not lofe me.\" \n \n Thompson looked at the girl with astonishment, then desiring her to wait where she was for a moment, descended into his cabin. After a short delay he returned to the deck bearing in his hands a small box which he handed to the bonne, saying, \"Addel-ly! I knows you ladies are fond of gold chains. I knows, too, that I have been rather too[Pg 213] soapy with you, but if you\u0027ll say you forgive me, as you knows I did it for the pretty one\u0027s sake, I\u0027ll give you that.\" \n \n Adèle walked aft and descended to the cabin, where she examined the chain, which was of solid gold, and the one that Jerry had looted from the pirate Seh-wang. After carefully weighing it in her hands, and reflecting for a few moments, the bonne returned to the deck, and having found out the patient Thompson, informed him \"that it was verray good, she vas content,\" and added in an undertone, \"Je voudrais être trompée, tous les jours à ce prix là!\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2685/73948.html","bookId":1483,"book":{"id":1483,"title":"Blue Jackets","description":"简介： The most cruel and ignominious punishment man can inflict upon his fellow men, is still enforced in the English Naval Service; though many indignantly deny it, and stigmatize this story as a libel on the British Navy.
