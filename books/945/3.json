It was a magnificently imposing building, as befitting the moral seat of the universe. And the Overseer was an equally imposing human with ears greyed by service. His congratulations were unreserved. \"A splendid mission, lad,\" he said, \"and I don\u0027t mind suggesting—strictly entre nous—that it could jolly well result in a Fleet Conductorship for you.\" The Conductor was overwhelmed. \"Now just let me jot down the essentials while they\u0027re still fresh in mind,\" he continued, pawing through a desk drawer. \"Botheration!
