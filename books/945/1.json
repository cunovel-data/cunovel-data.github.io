{"id":18499,"no":1,"title":"Chapter 1","content":"The missionaries came out of the planetary system of a star they didn\u0027t call Antares. They called it, naturally enough, The Sun—just as home was Earth, Terra, or simply The World. And naturally enough, being the ascendant animal on Earth, they called themselves human beings. They were looking for extraterrestrial souls to save. They had no real hope of finding humans like themselves in this wonderously diversified universe. But it wasn\u0027t against all probability that, in their rumaging, there might not be a humanoid species to whom they could reach down a helping paw; some emergent cousin with at least a rudimentary symmetry from snout to tail, and hence a rudimentary soul. The ship they chose was a compact scout, vaguely resembling the outside of an orange crate—except that they had no concept of an orange crate and, being a tesseract, it had no particular outside. It was simply an expanding cube (and as such, quite roomy) whose \"interior\" was always paralleling its \"exterior\" (or attempting to), in accordance with all the well-known, basic and irrefutable laws on the subject. A number of its sides occupied the same place at the same time, giving a hypothetical spectator the illusion of looking down merging sets of railway tracks. This, in fact, was its precise method of locomotion. The inner cube was always having to catch up, caboose-fashion, with the outer one in time (or space, depending on one\u0027s perspective). And whenever it had done so, it would have arrived with itself—at approximately wherever in the space-time continuum it had been pointed. When they felt the jar of the settling geodesics, the crew crowded at the forward visiplate to see where they were. It was the outskirts of a G type star system. Silently they watched the innermost planet float past, scorched and craggy, its sunward side seeming about to relapse to a molten state. The Bosun-Colonel turned to the Conductor. \"A bit of a disappointment I\u0027m afraid, sir. Surely with all that heat...?\" \"Steady, lad. The last wicket\u0027s not been bowled.\" The Conductor\u0027s whiskers quivered in amusement at his next-in-command\u0027s impetuosity. \"You\u0027ll notice that we\u0027re dropping downward. If the temperature accordingly continues dropping—\" He couldn\u0027t shrug, he wasn\u0027t physiologically capable of it, but it was apparent that he felt they\u0027d soon reach a planet whose climate could support intelligent life. If the Bosun-Colonel had any ideas that such directions as up and down were meaningless in space, he kept them to himself. As the second planet from its sun hove into view, he switched on the magniscan eagerly. \"I say, this is more like it. Clouds and all that sort of thing. Should we have a go at it, sir?\" The Conductor yawned. \"Too bloody cloudy for my taste. Too equivocal. Let\u0027s push on,\" he said languidly. \"I have a hunch the third planet might be just our dish of tea.\" Quelling his disappointment, the Bosun-Colonel waited for the third planet to swim into being. And when it did, blooming like an orchid in all its greens and moistnesses, he could scarcely contain his excitement. \"Why, it looks just like Earth,\" he marveled. \"Gad, sir, what a master stroke of navigation. How did you realize this would be it?\" \"Oh, I don\u0027t know,\" the Conductor said modestly. \"Things usually have a habit of occurring in threes. I\u0027m quite a student of numerology, you know.\" Then he remembered the Mission and drew himself erect on all his legs. \"You may prepare for landing, Mister,\" he ordered crisply. The Bosun-Colonel shifted over to manual and busied himself at the helm, luffing the square craft down the troughs of air. Gliding over the vast tropical oceans, he put down at a large land mass above a shallow warm sea, twenty-five degrees below the northern pole. Too numbed for comment, the crew stared out at the alien vista. They\u0027d heard of retarded life forms from other Missionary expeditions—of planets where the inhabitants, in extreme emergency, had been known to commit murder. But this was surely the worst, the most vicious imaginable in the galaxy. Here, with life freshly up from the sea, freshly launched on the long climb to maturity and self-realization—was nothing but horror. With so lush a vegetation, so easily capable of supporting them side by side in abundance, the monsters were actually feeding on each other. Great lumbering beasts they were with their bristling hides and huge tails, charging between the giant tree ferns; gouging living chunks from one another while razor-toothed birds with scaly wings flapped overhead, screaming for the remnants. As the sounds of carnage came through the audio ports, the youngest Oarsman keeled over in a faint. Even the Conductor was visibly shaken. The Bosun-Colonel turned to him with a sick expression. \"Surely it\u0027s a lost cause, Skipper. Life like this will never have a soul worth saving.\" \"Not in its present stage,\" the Old Man was forced to agree. \"Still, one never knows the devious paths that evolution takes.\" He considered the scene for a thoughtful, shuddering interval. \"Perhaps in several thousand millenniums....\" The Bosun-Colonel tried to visualize the possibility of Ethical Life ever materializing through these swamp mists, but the logic against it was too insurmountable for the imagination. \"Even so,\" he conceded, \"granting the impossible—whatever shape it took, the only worthwhile species would still be....\" He couldn\u0027t bring himself to say it. \"Meat-eaters,\" the Conductor supplied grimly. On hearing this, the Oarsman who had just revived promptly fainted again. \"It\u0027s too deep in the genes,\" the Conductor continued, \"too far advanced for us to tamper with. All we can hope to do is modify their moral outlook. So that by the time they achieve star travel, they\u0027ll at least have a basic sense of Fair Play.\" Sighing, bowed by responsibilities incommensurate with his chronological youth, he gave the order wearily. It was snapped down the chain of command to the Senior Yardbird: \"All paws stand by to lower the Ethics Ray! Step lively, lads—bugger off, now....\" There was a din of activity as the outer locks were opened and the bulky mechanism was shipped over the side. It squatted on a cleared rise of ground in all its complex, softly ticking majesty, waiting for the First Human to pad within range of its shedding Grace and Uplift. The work party scrambled back to the ship, anxious to be off this sinister terrain. Once more the crew gathered at the visiplate as the planet fell away beneath them, the Ethics Ray winking in the day\u0027s last light like a cornerstone. Or perhaps a tambourine.... \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3099/85419.html","bookId":945,"book":{"id":945,"title":"The Ethicators","description":"简介： The missionaries came out of the planetary system of a star they didn\u0027t call Antares.
