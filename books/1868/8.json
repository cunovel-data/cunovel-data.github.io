After pressing the snooze bar repeatedly, I unplugged my Nightmare Before Christmas alarm clock and stashed it under my bed. What I couldn\u0027t unplug was my mother\u0027s voice. \"Raven!\" she called for the millionth time from downstairs. \"You\u0027ve overslept. Again.\" After a quick shower, I threw on a black-on-black ensemble. I dragged myself into the kitchen to gulp down some of the leftover morning sludge that Dad called \"coffee.\" I found Billy Boy already commandeering the chair by the TV with our new house guest, Henry. The nerd-mates were glued to the screen, watching historic footage of battleships blasting their cannons and devouring Pop-Tarts and Crunch Berries. With every crunch of the captain and boom of a cannon, I felt like my head was behind enemy lines. \"Turn that off!\" I whined, and switched the channel to the Home Shopping Network. A petite blond with a perfect french manicure was modeling bedazzling silver bracelets. \"Hurry, there\u0027s only fifty seconds left!\" I warned Billy Boy. \"You could own one in just five easy payments. The blue topaz matches your eyes.\" Billy Boy raced to the TV and wrangled the control out of my hand. \"Get off!\" he said, switching it back to the History Channel. \"If you\u0027d watch, maybe you\u0027d learn something. Then your report card could be framed in Dad\u0027s office, instead of ending up in his paper shredder.\" I stirred cream and a pound of sugar into a java-filled Dullsville Country Club mug and poured myself a small bowl of Count Chocula. The gun battle and excessive crunching continued. I could barely open my charcoal eyelids wide enough to see the chocolate vampires floating in the milk among the marshmallow ghosts and bats. My mom burst into the kitchen in her Corporate Cathy gear--a crisp gray DKNY pantsuit and Kate Spade mules--and opened the fridge door. \"Morning,\" she said gleefully. \"I thought you\u0027d never get up.\" \"I didn\u0027t either,\" I grumbled. \"I saw Mrs. Mitchell at the pharmacy last night buying Trevor some cough syrup,\" she said, placing her Tupperware bowl filled with low-fat, low-taste premade salad in her Bloomingdale\u0027s tote bag. \"Trevor must have the same cold you had.\" \"Yeah, he\u0027s been out of school. It\u0027s been the first time I only detested school instead of hating it.\" \"Well, I think he\u0027s on the mend. His mother told me a girl has been bringing him protein shakes and he\u0027s feeling better.\" \"You mean one of the cheerleaders, right?\" I queried. \"No. Mrs. Mitchell made it very clear this girl is new to town and dresses--well, not very conservatively,\" my mom said, grabbing a bottled water and closing the fridge door. \"You mean, like me?\" My mother paused. It was Luna. \"Is it the white-haired girl Trevor was with at the Spring Carnival?\" Billy Boy asked. \"It may be,\" my mom answered. \"I didn\u0027t see them together.\" \"I just saw her from a distance,\" my brother said. \"But a kid at Math Club swears she has a twin. They were spotted coming out of the cemetery. Her brother was dressed like he just stepped off a pirate ship. \"Kids are saying they sleep in sewers,\" Billy Boy continued. \"It\u0027s not nice to gossip,\" my mother warned. \"I heard they\u0027re ghosts. One dude claims you can see right through them,\" Henry said. \"And talk about tattoos and piercing,\" Billy Boy added, \"I heard he has more holes in his head than you,\" Billy Boy said to me. \"I have tattoos,\" I said, rolling up my sleeve and showing him a bat tattoo. \"Your dad told you to wash that off,\" my mother advised. \"And he has pierced kneecaps,\" my brother went on. \"Well, I\u0027ll pierce your kneecaps if you don\u0027t stop gossiping like two old ladies.\" \"All right. Boys, you are going to miss your bus if you don\u0027t finish soon,\" my mother ordered. Henry and Billy Boy placed their empty bowls in the dishwasher. \"Mom, did Mrs. Mitchell say this girl brought Trevor protein shakes?\" I asked. \"Supposedly they are special shakes from Romania. I asked Mrs. Mitchell to get the recipe for me.\" Delicious drink, I thought. Ingredients: One cup crushed ice. One banana. One vial vampire\u0027s blood. \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027d like this particular Romanian drink.\" Finally we got a reprieve from the gunfire, and a commercial for Garlic One gelcaps came on the TV. Billy Boy aimed the remote to switch it off. \"No, wait,\" I said. \"You\u0027re suddenly interested in history?\" Billy Boy asked proudly. \"Maybe I\u0027m rubbing off on you after all.\" \"Shh...\" My mom followed Billy Boy and Henry as they headed for the front door. \"Garlic One,\" the commercial continued. \"Natural and odorless. Helps promote cardiovascular- health with just one capsule a day.\" Their slogan should say, \"An odor-free way to keep the vampires away.\" I was struck with an idea. Why hadn\u0027t I thought of it sooner? There was nothing I loved more than a brand-new plan!","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampireville-vampire-kisses-3/page-8.html","bookId":1868,"book":{"id":1868,"title":"Vampireville (Vampire Kisses #3)","description":"Storyline: Vampireville (Vampire Kisses #3) For goth-girl Raven, dating her dream boyfriend is complicated, especially because Alexander\u0027s secret means that they can see each other only at night.
