I grabbed my neck. \"Am I a...?\" I asked. Becky helped me up. \"I thought you were kidding when you said they were vampires. I think that Jagger guy really believed he was. He tried to bite you.\"\\n\\n I felt my neck for wounds.\\n\\n Suddenly the memory started to come back. I never thought it would happen.

Alexander was standing over Jagger, who was coughing and wheezing. Luna was leaning against the covenant coffin.\\n\\n Trevor had no idea that the garlic tablet was making them vulnerable. He thought it was his bravado.\\n\\n The soccer snobs encircled Jagger and Luna.\\n\\n Matt and Becky stayed by my side. \"Alexander\u0027s deathly allergic to garlic,\" I said.\\n\\n \"It looks like Jagger and Luna are, too,\" Becky remarked. \"That and being pummeled by Alexander and Trevor.\"\\n\\n \"I told Trevor the gelcap was an aphrodisiac,\" I proudly whispered when I reached Alexander.\\n\\n \"Apparently he told his friends, too,\" he said softly with a smile. \"The entire soccer team must have taken them.\" Alexander turned to Jagger and Luna. \"It\u0027s time you return to Romania. For good.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, go back to Romania, you freaks!\" Trevor said, balling up his fists.\\n\\n I put my arm around Alexander\u0027s waist and held him close.\\n\\n Then I turned to Trevor.\\n\\n \"I guess you are the school bully again,\" I complimented.\\n\\n Just then a dog started barking, distracting everyone. We all turned around.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s going on here?\" Old Jim, the caretaker, called, holding a flashlight toward us.\\n\\n Ghosts and goblins started to jump the fence. Werewolves and witches hid behind tombstones. The soccer snobs took off around the shed. Becky and Matt raced up the cemetery aisle.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s with all these cans?\" Old Jim scolded. \"I\u0027m going to call the police!\"\\n\\n Alexander, Trevor, and I turned back to the coffin.\\n\\n All that remained was the flickering candelabra.\\n\\n Jagger and Luna were gone. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampireville-vampire-kisses-3/page-18.html","bookId":1868,"book":{"id":1868,"title":"Vampireville (Vampire Kisses #3)","description":"Storyline: Vampireville (Vampire Kisses #3) \\n For goth-girl Raven, dating her dream boyfriend is complicated, especially because Alexander\u0027s secret means that they can see each other only at night. \\n And now the pair must be extra wary in the dark with Alexander\u0027s archrival, Jagger, appearing around town.
