Never one to retreat, I crept up the broken sidewalk slowly. I didn\u0027t want to be startled by Trevor or Jagger.\\n\\n As I got closer, I saw a gothic fairy girl with long white-and- pink-streaked hair leaning against a tree.\\n\\n \"Luna--what are you doing?\"\\n\\n \"Raven,\" she said, bouncing over and giving me a huge squeeze. \"I thought I\u0027d find you here.\"\\n\\n \"But I\u0027m meeting Alexander,\" I said, almost apologetically.\\n\\n \"I know, but I thought we could chat for a few.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to keep him...\"\\n\\n I looked up toward the Mansion. The attic window was dark.\\n\\n \"Well...maybe just a sec.\"\\n\\n We sat on a few rocks outside the Mansion\u0027s gate.\\n\\n \"Trevor has a history test. I won\u0027t see him until this weekend. Jagger told me he saw you last night,\" she confessed.\\n\\n \"Did he tell you where he saw me?\" I charged.\\n\\n \"In your bedroom.\"\\n\\n \"He can\u0027t do that again. He could scare my family.\"\\n\\n \"You did that to Trevor. You snuck into his room.\"\\n\\n Luna had a good point. \"That was different. I have a reputation.\"\\n\\n \"Jagger is a tricky one,\" she said with a hint of pride. \"He\u0027s been teaching me so many things since I\u0027ve been turned.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I hope they are good tricks,\" I warned. \"I love your purse,\" she said, touching the handle of my Corpse Bride clutch. \"Can I see?\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\" No one, not even Becky, ever got excited about my clothes or fashion accessories. I was proud to share it with her.\\n\\n She placed it on her arm and modeled it. \"So gloom! I love it.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks. I ordered it online. Maybe I can get you one.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d kill for one,\" she said eagerly. \"Got any candy? I gave my last piece to you yesterday.\"\\n\\n \"I should have some gum.\"\\n\\n Luna unzipped the purse. \"Be careful, it\u0027s a mess in there,\" I warned.\\n\\n \"Wouldn\u0027t be cool any other way,\" she said with a smile.\\n\\n I leaned back and watched the stars twinkling overhead.\\n\\n Luna pulled out a pack of Gabe\u0027s Grape Gross-Out Gum.\\n\\n She removed two sticks and returned the pack to my purse.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t mind her rooting around. I didn\u0027t have anything to hide in there. Or did I?\\n\\n \"What\u0027s this?\" she asked, pulling out Ruby\u0027s compact.\\n\\n My heart stopped.\\n\\n \"What do you need a compact for?\" Luna asked skeptically, holding the white plastic compact and stroking the red ruby R.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s an heirloom,\" I said, trying to reach for it.\\n\\n \"An heirloom?\" she wondered aloud. \"It doesn\u0027t look that old.\" Just then a Mustang drove up the road and stopped in front of the Mansion.\\n\\n I grabbed the compact and purse and ran to the car.\\n\\n \"Matt! Becky! How are you guys doing?\"\\n\\n \"Hey, Raven, what\u0027s up?\" Matt asked.\\n\\n \"Hi, Beck,\" I said, smiling.\\n\\n Luna inched up next to me. \"Hi, Beck,\" she said, also grinning.\\n\\n Becky\u0027s smile was strained. My normally amiable best friend looked at me with disdain.\\n\\n \"I thought you were hanging out with Alexander,\" Becky said.\\n\\n \"I am; I\u0027m just on my way in.\"\\n\\n \"We just had to have a girl chat before,\" Luna chimed in.\\n\\n I was annoyed. There was no need for Luna to try to make Becky jealous.\\n\\n \"I better go see Alexander now,\" I finally said. \"I\u0027ll see you tomorrow, Becky.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" she said.\\n\\n I stepped away from the car. Luna put her arm around me and waved at Becky.\\n\\n Becky politely waved back.\\n\\n The Mustang headed down the windy road. Alexander had warned me about the motives of Jagger and Luna.\\n\\n \"Bye, Luna,\" I said, heading for the Mansion as she waited by the street. This time I was the one to disappear. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampireville-vampire-kisses-3/page-13.html","bookId":1868,"book":{"id":1868,"title":"Vampireville (Vampire Kisses #3)","description":"Storyline: Vampireville (Vampire Kisses #3) \\n For goth-girl Raven, dating her dream boyfriend is complicated, especially because Alexander\u0027s secret means that they can see each other only at night. \\n And now the pair must be extra wary in the dark with Alexander\u0027s archrival, Jagger, appearing around town.
