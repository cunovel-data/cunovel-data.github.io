While they stood looking out at the old houses, a small plane flew in over the rooftops. Fixed to its tail was a long banner which Sophie guessed would be advertising some product or local event, a rock concert perhaps. But as it approached and turned, she saw quite a different message: HAPPY BIRTHDAY, HILDE! \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Gate-crasher,\" was Alberto\u0027s only comment. \\n\\n \\n\\n Heavy black clouds from the hills to the south were now beginning to gather over the town. The little plane disappeared into the grayness. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid there\u0027s going to be a storm,\" said Alberto. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So I\u0027ll take the bus home.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I only hope the major isn\u0027t behind this, too.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s not God Almighty, is he?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Alberto did not reply. He walked across the room and sat down again by the coffee table. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We have to talk about Berkeley,\" he said after a while. \\n\\n \\n\\n Sophie had already resumed her place. She caught herself biting her nails. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"George Berkeley was an Irish bishop who lived from 1685 to 1753,\" Alberto began. There was a long silence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Berkeley was an Irish bishop ...\" Sophie prompted. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But he was a philosopher as well...\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He felt that current philosophies and science were a threat to the Christian way of life, that the all-pervading materialism, not least, represented a threat to the Christian faith in God as creator and preserver of all nature.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He did?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And yet Berkeley was the most consistent of the empiricists.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He believed we cannot know any more of the world than we can perceive through the senses?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"More than that. Berkeley claimed that worldly things are indeed as we perceive them, but they are not \u0027things.\u0027 \" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ll have to explain that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You remember that Locke pointed out that we cannot make statements about the \u0027secondary qualities\u0027 of things. We cannot say an apple is green and sour. We can only say we perceive it as being so. But Locke also said that the \u0027primary qualities\u0027 like density, gravity, and weight really do belong to the external reality around us. External reality has, in fact, a material substance.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I remember that, and I think Locke\u0027s division of things was important.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, Sophie, if only that were all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Goon.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Locke believed--just like Descartes and Spinoza-- that the material world is a reality.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This is just what Berkeley questioned, and he did so by the logic of empiricism. He said the only things that exist are those we perceive. But we do not perceive \u0027material\u0027 or \u0027matter.\u0027 We do not perceive things as tangible objects. To assume that what we perceive has its own underlying \u0027substance\u0027 is jumping to conclusions. We have absolutely no experience on which to base such a claim.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How stupid. Look!\" Sophie thumped her fist hard on the table. \"Ouch,\" she said. \"Doesn\u0027t that prove that this table is really a table, both of material and matter?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How did you feel it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I felt something hard.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You had a sensation of something hard, but you didn\u0027t feel the actual matter in the table. In the same way, you can dream you are hitting something hard, but there isn\u0027t anything hard in a dream, is there?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, not in a dream.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A person can also be hypnotized into \u0027feeling\u0027 things like warmth and cold, a caress or a punch.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But if the table wasn\u0027t really hard, why did I feel it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Berkeley believed in a \u0027spirit.\u0027 He thought all our ideas have a cause beyond our consciousness, but that this cause is not of a material nature. It is spiritual.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Sophie had started biting her nails again. \\n\\n \\n\\n Alberto continued: \"According to Berkeley, my own soul can be the cause of my own ideas--just as when I dream--but only another will or spirit can be the cause of the ideas that make up the \u0027corporeal\u0027 world. Everything is due to that spirit which is the cause of \u0027everything in everything\u0027 and which \u0027all things consist in,\u0027 he said.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What \u0027spirit\u0027 was he talking about?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Berkeley was of course thinking of God. He said that \u0027we can moreover claim that the existence of God is far more clearly perceived than the existence of man.\"\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is it not even certain that we exist?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, and no. Everything we see and feel is \u0027an effect of God\u0027s power,\u0027 said Berkeley. For God is \u0027intimately present in our consciousness, causing to exist for us the profusion of ideas and perceptions that we are constantly subject to.\u0027 The whole world around us and our whole life exist in God. He is the one cause of everything that exists. We exist only in the mind of God.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am amazed, to put it mildly.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So \u0027to be or not to be\u0027 is not the whole question. The question is also who we are. Are we really human beings of flesh and blood? Does our world consist of real things--or are we encircled by the mind?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Sophie continued to bite her nails. \\n\\n \\n\\n Alberto went on: \"Material reality was not the only thing Berkeley was questioning. He was also questioning whether \u0027time\u0027 and \u0027space\u0027 had any absolute or independent existence. Our own perception of time and space can also be merely figments of the mind. A week or two for us need not be a week or two for God ...\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You said that for Berkeley this spirit that everything exists in is the Christian God.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, I suppose I did. But for us ...\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Us?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"For us--for you and me--this \u0027will or spirit\u0027 that is the \u0027cause of everything in everything\u0027 could be Hilde\u0027s father.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Sophie\u0027s eyes opened wide with incredulity. Yet at the same time a realization began to dawn on her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is that what you think?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I cannot see any other possibility. That is perhaps the only feasible explanation for everything that has happened to us. All those postcards and signs that have turned up here and there... Hermes beginning to talk ... my own involuntary slips of the tongue.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I...\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Imagine my calling you Sophie, Hilde! I knew all the time that your name wasn\u0027t Sophie.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What are you saying? Now you are definitely confused.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, my mind is going round and round, my child. Like a giddy planet round a burning sun.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And that sun is Hilde\u0027s father?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You could say so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Are you saying he\u0027s been a kind of God for us?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To be perfectly candid, yes. He should be ashamed of himself!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What about Hilde herself?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She is an angel, Sophie.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An angel?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hilde is the one this \u0027spirit\u0027 turns to.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Are you saying that Albert Knag tells Hilde about us?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Or writes about us. For we cannot perceive the matter itself that our reality is made of, that much we have learned. We cannot know whether our external reality is made of sound waves or of paper and writing. According to Berkeley, all we can know is that we are spirit.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And Hilde is an angel...\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hilde is an angel, yes. Let that be the last word. Happy birthday, Hilde!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Suddenly the room was filled with a bluish light. A few seconds later they heard the crash of thunder and the whole house shook. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have to go,\" said Sophie. She got up and ran to the front door. As she let herself out, Hermes woke up from his nap in the hallway. She thought she heard him say, \"See you later, Hilde.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Sophie rushed down the stairs and ran out into the street. It was deserted. And now the rain came down in torrents. \\n\\n \\n\\n One or two cars were plowing through the downpour, but there were no buses in sight. Sophie ran across Main Square and on through the town. As she ran, one thought kept going round and round in her mind: \"Tomorrow is my birthday* Isn\u0027t it extra bitter to realize that life is only a dream on the day before your fifteenth birthday? It\u0027s like dreaming you won a million and then just as you\u0027re getting the money you wake up.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Sophie ran across the squelching playing field. Minutes later she saw someone come running toward her. It was her mother. The sky was pierced again and again by angry darts of lightning. \\n\\n \\n\\n When they reached each other Sophie\u0027s mother put her arm around her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s happening to us, little one?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Sophie sobbed. \"It\u0027s like a bad dream.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/2013/57402.html","bookId":3,"book":{"id":3,"title":"苏菲的世界 Sophies World","description":"简介： 14岁的少女苏菲某天放学回家，收到了神秘的一封信你是谁？世界从哪里来？与此同时，她收到一封古怪的明信片，上面的收件人是请苏菲转交给席德（Hilde），邮戳来自黎巴嫩。...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/2013","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:29 AM"}}
