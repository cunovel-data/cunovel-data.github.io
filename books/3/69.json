{"id":100,"no":69,"title":"The Big Bang","content":"... we too are stardust. . . Hilde settled herself comfortably in the glider beside her father. It was nearly midnight. They sat looking out across the bay. A few stars glimmered palely in the light sky. Gentle waves lapped over the stones under the dock. Her father broke the silence. \"It\u0027s a strange thought that we live on a tiny little planet in the universe.\" \"Yes ...\" \"Earth is only one of many planets orbiting the sun. Yet Earth is the only living planet.\" \"Perhaps the only one in the entire universe?\" \"It\u0027s possible. But it\u0027s also possible that the universe is teeming with life. The universe is inconceivably huge. The distances are so great that we measure them in light-minutes and light-years.\" \"What are they, actually?\" \"A light-minute is the distance light travels in one minute. And that\u0027s a long way, because light travels through space at 300,000 kilometers a second. That means that a light-minute is 60 times 300,000--or 18 million kilometers. A light-year is nearly ten trillion kilometers.\" \"How far away is the sun?\" \"It\u0027s a little over eight light-minutes away. The rays of sunlight warming our faces on a hot June day have traveled for eight minutes through the universe before they reach us.\" \"Go on...\" \"Pluto, which is the planet farthest out in our solar system, is about five light-hours away from us. When an astronomer looks at Pluto through his telescope, he is in fact looking five hours back in time. We could also say that the picture of Pluto takes five hours to get here.\" \"It\u0027s a bit hard to visualize, but I think I understand.\" \"That\u0027s good, Hilde. But we here on Earth are only just beginning to orient ourselves. Our own sun is one of 400 billion other stars in the galaxy we call the Milky Way. This galaxy resembles a large discus, with our sun situated in one of its several spiral arms. When we look up at the sky on a clear winter\u0027s night, we see a broad band of stars. This is because we are looking toward the center of the Milky Way.\" \"I suppose that\u0027s why the Milky Way is called \u0027Winter Street\u0027 in Swedish.\" \"The distance to the star in the Milky Way that is our nearest neighbor is four light-years. Maybe that\u0027s it just above the island over there. If you could imagine that at this very moment a stargazer is sitting up there with a powerful telescope pointing at Bjerkely--he would see Bjerkely as it looked four years ago. He might see an eleven-year-old girl swinging her legs in the glider.\" \"Incredible.\" \"But that\u0027s only the nearest star. The whole galaxy-- or nebula, as we also call it--is 90,000 light-years wide. That is another way of describing the time it takes for light to travel from one end of the galaxy to the other. When we gaze at a star in the Milky Way which is 50,000 light-years away from our sun, we are looking back 50,000 years in time.\" \"The idea is much too big for my little head.\" \"The only way we can look out into space, then, is to look back in time. We can never know what the universe is like now. We only know what it was like then. When we look up at a star that is thousands of light-years away, we are really traveling thousands of years back in the history of space.\" \"It\u0027s completely incomprehensible.\" \"But everything we see meets the eye in the form of light waves. And these light waves take time to travel through space. We could compare it to thunder. We always hear the thunder after we have seen the lightning. That\u0027s because sound waves travel slower than light waves. When I hear a peal of thunder, I\u0027m hearing the sound of something that happened a little while ago. It\u0027s the same thing with the stars. When I look at a star that is thousands of light-years away, I\u0027m seeing the \u0027peal of thunder\u0027 from an event that lies thousands of years back in time.\" \"Yes, I see.\" \"But so far, we\u0027ve only been talking about our own galaxy. Astronomers say there are about a hundred billion of such galaxies in the universe, and each of these galaxies consists of about a hundred billion stars. We call the nearest galaxy to the Milky Way the Andromeda nebula. It lies two million light-years from our own galaxy. That means the light from that galaxy takes two million years to reach us. So we\u0027re looking two million years back in time when we see the Andromeda nebula high up in the sky. If there was a clever stargazer in this nebula--I can just imagine him pointing his telescope at Earth right now--he wouldn\u0027t be able to see us. If he was lucky, he\u0027d see a few flat-faced Neanderthals.\" \"It\u0027s amazing.\" \"The most distant galaxies we know of today are about ten billion light-years away from us. When we receive signals from these galaxies, we are going ten billion years back in the history of the universe. That\u0027s about twice as long as our own solar system has existed.\" \"You\u0027re making me dizzy.\" \"Although it is hard enough to comprehend what it means to look so far back in time, astronomers have discovered something that has even greater significance for our world picture.\" \"What?\" \"Apparently no galaxy in space remains where it is. All the galaxies in the universe are moving away from each other at colossal speeds. The further they are away from us, the quicker they move. That means that the distance between the galaxies is increasing all the time.\" \"I\u0027m trying to picture it.\" \"If you have a balloon and you paint black spots on it, the spots will move away from each other as you blow up the balloon. That\u0027s what\u0027s happening with the galaxies in the universe. We say that the universe is expanding.\" \"What makes it do that?\" \"Most astronomers agree that the expanding universe can only have one explanation: Once upon a time, about 15 billion years ago, all substance in the universe was assembled in a relatively small area. The substance was so dense that gravity made it terrifically hot. Finally it got so hot and so tightly packed that it exploded. We call this explosion the Big Bang.\" \"Just the thought of it makes me shudder.\" \"The Big Bang caused all the substance in the universe to be expelled in all directions, and as it gradually cooled, it formed stars and galaxies and moons and planets ...\" \"But I thought you said the universe was still expanding?\" \"Yes I did, and it\u0027s expanding precisely because of this explosion billions of years ago. The universe has no timeless geography. The universe is a happening. The universe is an explosion. Galaxies continue to fly through the universe away from each other at colossal speeds.\" \"Will they go on doing that for ever?\" \"That\u0027s one possibility. But there is another. You may recall that Alberto told Sophie about the two forces that cause the planets to remain in constant orbit round the sun?\" \"Weren\u0027t they gravity and inertia?\" \"Right, and the same thing applies to the galaxies. Because even though the universe continues to expand, the force of gravity is working the other way. And one day, in a couple of billion years, gravity will perhaps cause the heavenly bodies to be packed together again as the force of the huge explosion begins to weaken. Then we would get a reverse explosion, a so-called implosion. But the distances are so great that it will happen like a movie that is run in slow motion. You might compare it with what happens when you release the air from a balloon.\" \"Will all the galaxies be drawn together in a tight nucleus again?\" \"Yes, you\u0027ve got it. But what will happen then?\" \"There would be another Big Bang and the universe would start expanding again. Because the same natural laws are in operation. And so new stars and galaxies will form.\" \"Good thinking. Astronomers think there are two possible scenarios for the future of the universe. Either the universe will go on expanding forever so that the galaxies will draw further and further apart--or the universe will begin to contract again. How heavy and massive the universe is will determine what happens. And this is something astronomers have no way of knowing as yet.\" \"But if the universe is so heavy that it begins to contract again, perhaps it has expanded and contracted lots of times before.\" \"That would be an obvious conclusion. But on this point theory is divided. It may be that the expansion of the universe is something that will only happen this one time. But if it keeps on expanding for all eternity, the question of where it all began becomes even more pressing.\" \"Yes, where did it come from, all that stuff that suddenly exploded?\" \"For a Christian, it would be obvious to see the Big Bang as the actual moment of creation. The Bible tells us that God said \u0027Let there be light!\u0027 You may possibly also remember that Alberto indicated Christianity\u0027s \u0027linear\u0027 view of history. From the point of view of a Chris-tian belief in the creation, it is better to imagine the universe continuing to expand.\" \"It is?\" \"In the Orient they have a \u0027cyclic\u0027 view of history. In other words, history repeats itself eternally. In India, for example, there is an ancient theory that the world continually unfolds and folds again, thus alternating between what Indians have called Brahman\u0027s Day and Brahman\u0027s Night. This idea harmonizes best, of course, with the universe expanding and contracting--in order to expand again--in an eternal cyclic process. I have a mental picture of a great cosmic heart that beats and beats and beats...\" \"I think both theories are equally inconceivable and equally exciting.\" \"And they can compare with the great paradox of eternity that Sophie once sat pondering in her garden: either the universe has always been there--or it suddenly came into existence out of nothing ...\" \"Ouch!\" Hilde clapped her hand to her forehead. \"What was that?\" \"I think I\u0027ve just been stung by a gadfly.\" \"It was probably Socrates trying to sting you into life.\" Sophie and Alberto had been sitting in the red convertible listening to the major tell Hilde about the universe. \"Has it struck you that our roles are completely reversed?\" asked Alberto after a while. \"In what sense?\" \"Before it was they who listened to us, and we couldn\u0027t see them. Now we\u0027re listening to them and they can\u0027t see us.\" \"And that\u0027s not all.\" \"What are you referring to?\" \"When we started, we didn\u0027t know about the other reality that Hilde and the major inhabited. Now they don\u0027t know about ours.\" \"Revenge is sweet.\" \"But the major could intervene in our world.\" \"Our world was nothing but his interventions.\" \"I haven\u0027t yet relinquished all hope that we may also intervene in their world.\" \"But you know that\u0027s impossible. Remember what happened in the Cinderella? I saw you trying to get out that bottle of Coke.\" Sophie was silent. She gazed out over the garden while the major explained about the Big Bang. There was something about that term which started a train of thought in her mind. She began to rummage around in the car. \"What are you doing?\" asked Alberto. \"Nothing.\" She opened the glove compartment and found a wrench. She grabbed it and jumped out of the car. She went over to the glider and stood right in front of Hilde and her father. First she tried to catch Hilde\u0027s eye but that was quite useless. Finally she raised the wrench above her head and crashed it down on Hilde\u0027s forehead. \"Ouch!\" said Hilde. Then Sophie hit the major on his forehead, but he didn\u0027t react at all. \"What was that?\" he asked. \"I think I\u0027ve just been stung by a gadfly.\" \"It was probably Socrates trying to sting you into life.\" Sophie lay down on the grass and tried to push the glider. But it remained motionless. Or did she manage to get it to move a millimeter? \"There\u0027s a chilly breeze coming up,\" said Hilde. \"No, there isn\u0027t. It\u0027s very mild.\" \"It\u0027s not only that. There is something.\" \"Only the two of us and the cool summer night.\" \"No, there\u0027s something in the air.\" \"And what might that be?\" \"You remember Alberto and his secret plan?\" \"How could I forget!\" \"They simply disappeared from the garden party. It was as if they had vanished into thin air . . .\" \"Yes, but...\" \"... into thin air.\" \"The story had to end somewhere. It was just something I wrote.\" \"That was, yes, but not what happened afterward. Suppose they were here . . .\" \"Do you believe that?\" \"I can feel it, Dad.\" Sophie ran back to the car. \"Impressive,\" said Alberto grudgingly as she climbed on board clasping the wrench tightly in her hand. \"You have unusual talents, Sophie. Just wait and see.\" The major put his arm around Hilde. \"Do you hear the mysterious play of the waves?\" \"Yes. We must get the boat in the water tomorrow.\" \"But do you hear the strange whispering of the wind? Look how the aspen leaves are trembling.\" \"The planet is alive, you know ...\" \"You wrote that there was something between the lines.\" \"I did?\" \"Perhaps there is something between the lines in this garden too.\" \"Nature is full of enigmas. But we are talking about stars in the sky.\" \"Soon there will be stars on the water.\" \"That\u0027s right. That\u0027s what you used to say about phosphorescence when you were little. And in a sense you were right. Phosphorescence and all other organisms are made of elements that were once blended together in a star.\" \"Us too?\" \"Yes, we too are stardust.\" \"That was beautifully put.\" \"When radio telescopes can pick up light from distant galaxies billions of light-years away, they will be charting the universe as it looked in primeval times after the Big Bang. Everything we can see in the sky is a cosmic fossil from thousands and millions of years ago. The only thing an astrologer can do is predict the past.\" \"Because the stars in the constellations moved away from each other long before their light reached us, right?\" \"Even two thousand years ago, the constellations looked considerably different from the way they look today.\" \"I never knew that.\" \"If it\u0027s a clear night, we can see millions, even billions of years back into the history of the universe. So in a way, we are going home.\" \"I don\u0027t know what you mean.\" \"You and I also began with the Big Bang, because all substance in the universe is an organic unity. Once in a primeval age all matter was gathered in a clump so enormously massive that a pinhead weighed many billions of tons. This \u0027primeval atom\u0027 exploded because of the enormous gravitation. It was as if something disintegrated. When we look up at the sky, we are trying to find the way back to ourselves.\" \"What an extraordinary thing to say.\" \"All the stars and galaxies in the universe are made of the same substance. Parts of it have lumped themselves together, some here, some there. There can be billions of light-years between one galaxy and the next. But they all have the same origin. All stars and all planets belong to the same family.\" \"Yes, I see.\" \"But what is this earthly substance? What was it that exploded that time billions of years ago? Where did it come from?\" \"That is the big question.\" \"And a question that concerns us all very deeply. For we ourselves are of that substance. We are a spark from the great fire that was ignited many billions of years ago.\" \"That\u0027s a beautiful thought too.\" \"However, we must not exaggerate the importance of these figures. It is enough just to hold a stone in your hand. The universe would have been equally incomprehensible if it had only consisted of that one stone the size of an orange. The question would be just as impenetrable: where did this stone come from?\" Sophie suddenly stood up in the red convertible and pointed out over the bay. \"I want to try the rowboat,\" she said. \"It\u0027s tied up. And we would never be able to lift the oars.\" \"Shall we try? After all, it is Midsummer Eve.\" \"We can go down to the water, at any rate.\" They jumped out of the car and ran down the garden. They tried to loosen the rope that was made fast in a metal ring. But they could not even lift one end. \"It\u0027s as good as nailed down,\" said Alberto. \"We\u0027ve got plenty of time.\" \"A true philosopher must never give up. If we could just... get it loose . . .\" \"There are more stars now,\" said Hilde. \"Yes, when the summer night is darkest.\" \"But they sparkle more in winter. Do you remember the night before you left for Lebanon? It was New Year\u0027s Day.\" \"That was when I decided to write a book about philosophy for you. I had been to a large bookstore in Kris-tiansand and to the library too. But they had nothing suitable for young people.\" \"It\u0027s as if we are sitting at the very tip of the fine hairs in the white rabbit\u0027s fur.\" \"I wonder if there is anyone out there in the night of the light-years?\" \"The rowboat has worked itself loose!\" \"So it has!\" \"I don\u0027t understand it. I went down and checked it just before you got here.\" \"Did you?\" \"It reminds me of when Sophie borrowed Alberto\u0027s boat. Do you remember how it lay drifting out in the lake?\" \"I bet it\u0027s her at work again.\" \"Go ahead and make fun of me. All evening, I\u0027ve been able to feel someone here.\" \"One of us will have to swim out to it.\" \"We\u0027ll both go, Dad.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/2013/57428.html","bookId":3,"book":{"id":3,"title":"苏菲的世界 Sophies World","description":"简介： 14岁的少女苏菲某天放学回家，收到了神秘的一封信你是谁？世界从哪里来？与此同时，她收到一封古怪的明信片，上面的收件人是请苏菲转交给席德（Hilde），邮戳来自黎巴嫩。...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/2013","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:29 AM"}}
