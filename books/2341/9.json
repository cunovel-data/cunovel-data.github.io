{"id":65815,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"MARILYN STONE MISSED lunch because she was busy, but didn\u0027t mind because she was happy about the way the place was starting to look. She found herself regarding the whole business in a very dispassionate manner, which surprised her a little, because after all it was her home she was getting ready to sell, her own home, the place she\u0027d chosen with care and thought and excitement not so many years ago. It had been the place of her dreams. Way bigger and better than anything she\u0027d ever expected to have. It had been a physical thrill back then, just thinking about it. Moving in felt like she\u0027d died and gone to heaven. Now she was just looking at the place like a showpiece, like a marketing proposition. She wasn\u0027t seeing rooms she\u0027d decorated and lived in and thrilled to and enjoyed. There was no pain. No wistful glances at places where she and Chester had fooled around and laughed and ate and slept. Just a brisk and businesslike determination to bring it all up to a whole new peak of irresistibility. The furniture movers had arrived first, just as she\u0027d planned. She had them take the credenza out of the hallway, and then Chester\u0027s armchair out of the living room. Not because it was a bad piece, but because it was definitely an extra piece. It was his favorite chair, chosen in the way men choose things, for comfort and familiarity rather than for style and suitability. It was the only piece they\u0027d brought from their last house. He\u0027d put it next to the fireplace, at an angle. Day to day, she rather liked it. It gave the room a comfortable lived-in quality. It was the touch that changed the room from a magazine showpiece to a family home. Which was exactly why it had to go. She had the movers carry out the butcher\u0027s block table from the kitchen, too. She had thought long and hard about that table. It certainly gave the kitchen a no-nonsense look. Like it was a proper workplace, speaking of serious meals planned and executed there. But without it, there was an uninterrupted thirty-foot expanse of tiled floor running all the way to the bay window. She knew that with fresh polish on the tile, the light from the window would flood the whole thirty-foot span into a sea of space. She had put herself in a prospective buyer\u0027s shoes and asked herself: Which would impress you more? A serious kitchen? Or a drop-dead spacious kitchen? So the butcher\u0027s block was in the mover\u0027s truck. The TV from the den was in there, too. Chester had a problem with television sets. Video had killed the home-movie side of his business and he had no enthusiasm for buying the latest and best of his competitors\u0027 products. So the TV was an obsolete RCA, not even a console model. It had shiny fake chrome around the screen, and it bulged out like a gray fishbowl. She had seen better sets junked on the sidewalk, looking down from the train when it eased into the 125th Street station. So she\u0027d had the movers clear it out of the den and bring the bookcase down from the guest suite to fill its space. She thought the room looked much better for it. With just the bookcase and the leather couches and the dark lampshades, it looked like a cultured room. An intelligent room. It made it an aspirational space. Like a buyer would be buying a lifestyle, not just a house. She spent some time choosing books for the coffee tables. Then the florist arrived with flat cardboard boxes full of blooms. She had the girl wash all her vases and then left her alone with a European magazine and told her to copy the arrangements. The guy from Sheryl\u0027s office brought the for-sale sign and she had him plant it in the shoulder next to the mailbox. Then the garden crew arrived at the same time the movers were leaving, which required some awkward maneuvering out on the driveway. She led the crew chief around the garden, explaining what had to be done, and then she ducked back inside the house before the roar of the mowers started up. The pool boy came to the door at the same time as the cleaning service people arrived. She was caught glancing left and right between them, momentarily overcome and unsure of who to start first. But then she nodded firmly and told the cleaners to wait and led the boy around to the pool and showed him what needed doing. Then she ran back to the house, feeling hungry, realizing she\u0027d missed her lunch, but glowing with satisfaction at the progress she was making. THEY BOTH MADE it down the hallway to see him leave. The old man worked on the oxygen long enough to get himself up out of his chair, and then he wheeled the cylinder slowly ahead of him, partly leaning on it like a cane, partly pushing it like a golf trolley. His wife rustled along in front of him, her skirt brushing both doorjambs and both sides of the narrow passageway. Reacher followed behind them, with the leather folder tucked up under his arm. The old lady worked the lock on the door and the old man stood panting and gripping the handle of the cart. The door opened and sweet fresh air blew in. \"Any of Victor\u0027s old friends still around here?\" Reacher asked. \"Is that important, Major?\" Reacher shrugged. He had learned a long time ago the best way to prepare people for bad news was by looking very thorough, right from the start. People listened better if they thought you\u0027d exhausted every possibility. \"I just need to build up some background,\" he said. They looked mystified, but like they were ready to think about it, because he was their last hope. He held their son\u0027s life in his hands, literally. \"Ed Steven, I guess, at the hardware store,\" Mr. Hobie said eventually. \"Thick as thieves with Victor, from kindergarten right through twelfth grade. But that was thirty-five years ago, Major. Don\u0027t see how it can matter now.\" Reacher nodded, because it didn\u0027t matter now. \"I\u0027ve got your number,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll call you, soon as I know anything.\" \"We\u0027re relying on you,\" the old lady said. Reacher nodded again. \"It was a pleasure to meet you both,\" he said. \"Thank you for the coffee and the cake. And I\u0027m very sorry about your situation.\" They made no reply. It was a hopeless thing to say. Thirty years of agony, and he was sorry about their situation? He just turned and shook their frail hands and stepped back outside onto their overgrown path. Picked his way back to the Taurus, carrying the folder, looking firmly ahead. He reversed down the driveway, catching the vegetation on both sides, and eased out of the track. Made the right and headed south on the quiet road he\u0027d left to find the house. The town of Brighton firmed up ahead of him. The road widened and smoothed out. There was a gas station and a fire-house. A small municipal park with a Little League diamond. A supermarket with a large parking lot, a bank, a row of small stores sharing a common frontage, set back from the street. The supermarket\u0027s parking lot seemed to be the geographic center of the town. He cruised slowly past it and saw a nursery, with lines of shrubs in pots under a sprinkler which was making rainbows in the sun. Then a large shed, dull red paint, standing in its own lot: Steven\u0027s Hardware. He swung the Taurus in and parked next to a timber store in back. The entrance was an insignificant door set in the end wall of the shed. It gave onto a maze of aisles, packed tight with every kind of thing he\u0027d never had to buy. Screws, nails, bolts, hand tools, power tools, garbage cans, mailboxes, panes of glass, window units, doors, cans of paint. The maze led to a central core, where four shop counters were set in a square under bright fluorescent lighting. Inside the corral were a man and two boys, dressed in jeans and shirts and red canvas aprons. The man was lean and small, maybe fifty, and the boys were clearly his sons, younger versions of the same face and physique, maybe eighteen and twenty. \"Ed Steven?\" Reacher asked. The man nodded and set his head at an angle and raised his eyebrows, like a guy who has spent thirty years dealing with inquiries from salesmen and customers. \"Can I talk to you about Victor Hobie?\" The guy looked blank for a second, and then he glanced sideways at his boys, like he was spooling backward all the way through their lives and far beyond, back to when he last knew Victor Hobie. \"He died in \u0027Nam, right?\" he said. \"I need some background.\" \"Checking for his folks again?\" He said it without surprise, and there was an edge of weariness in there, too. Like the Hobies\u0027 problems were well known in the town, and gladly tolerated, but no longer exciting any kind of urgent sympathy. Reacher nodded. \"I need to get a feel for what sort of a guy he was. Story is you knew him pretty well.\" Steven looked blank again. \"Well, I did, I guess. But we were just kids. I only saw him once, after high school.\" \"Want to tell me about him?\" \"I\u0027m pretty busy. I\u0027ve got unloading to see to.\" \"I could give you a hand. We could talk while we\u0027re doing it.\" Steven started to say a routine no, but then he glanced at Reacher, saw the size of him, and smiled like a laborer who\u0027s been offered the free use of a forklift. \"OK,\" he said. \"Out back.\" He came out from the corral of counters and led Reacher through a rear door. There was a dusty pickup parked in the sun next to an open shed with a tin roof. The pickup was loaded with bags of cement. The shelves in the open shed were empty. Reacher took his jacket off and laid it on the hood of the truck. The bags were made of thick paper. He knew from his time with the pool gang that if he used two hands on the middle of the bags, they would fold themselves over and split. The way to do it was to clamp a palm on the comer and lift them one-handed. That would keep the dust off his new shirt, too. The bags weighed a hundred pounds, so he did them two at a time, one in each hand, holding them out, counterbalanced away from his body. Steven watched him, like he was a side-show at the circus. \"So tell me about Victor Hobie,\" Reacher grunted. Steven shrugged. He was leaning on a post, under the tin roof, out of the sun. \"Long time ago,\" he said. \"What can I tell you? We were just kids, you know? Our dads were in the chamber of commerce together. His was a printer. Mine ran this place, although it was just a lumberyard back then. We were together all the way through school. We started kindergarten on the same day, graduated high school on the same day. I only saw him once after that, when he was home from the Army. He\u0027d been in Vietnam a year, and he was going back again.\" \"So what sort of a guy was he?\" Steven shrugged again. \"I\u0027m kind of wary about giving you an opinion.\" \"Why? Some kind of bad news in there?\" \"No, no, nothing like that,\" Steven said. \"There\u0027s nothing to hide. He was a good kid. But I\u0027d be giving you one kid\u0027s opinion about another kid from thirty-five years ago, right? Might not be a reliable opinion.\" Reacher paused, with a hundred-pound bag in each hand. Glanced back at Steve. He was leaning on his post in his red apron, lean and fit, the exact picture of what Reacher assumed was a typical cautious small-town Yankee businessman. The sort of guy whose judgment might be reasonably solid. He nodded. \"OK, I can see that. I\u0027ll take it into account.\" Steven nodded back, like the ground rules were clear. \"How old are you?\" \"Thirty-eight,\" Reacher said. \"From around here?\" Reacher shook his head. \"Not really from around anywhere.\" \"OK, couple of things you need to understand,\" Steven said. \"This is a small small suburban town, and Victor and I were born here in \u002748. We were already fifteen years old when Kennedy got shot, and sixteen before the Beatles arrived, and twenty when there was all that rioting in Chicago and L.A. You know what I\u0027m saying here?\" \"Different world,\" Reacher said. \"You bet your ass it was,\" Steven said back. \"We grew up in a different world. Our whole childhood. To us, a real daring guy was one who put baseball cards in the wheels of his Schwinn. You need to bear that in mind, when you hear what I say.\" Reacher nodded. Lifted the ninth and tenth bag out of the pickup bed. He was sweating lightly, and worrying about the state of his shirt when Jodie next saw it. \"Victor was a very straight kid,\" Steven said. \"A very straight and normal kid. And like I say, for comparative purposes, that was back when the rest of us thought we were the bee\u0027s knees for staying out until half past nine on a Saturday night, drinking milk shakes.\" \"What was he interested in?\" Reacher asked. Steven blew out his cheeks and shrugged. \"What can I tell you? Same things as all the rest of us, I guess. Baseball, Mickey Mantle. We liked Elvis, too. Ice cream, and the Lone Ranger. Stuff like that. Normal stuff.\" \"His dad said he always wanted to be a soldier.\" \"We all did. First it was cowboys and Indians, then it was soldiers.\" \"So did you go to \u0027Nam?\" Steven shook his head. \"No, I kind of moved on from the soldier thing. Not because I disapproved. You got to understand, this was way, way before all that longhair stuff arrived up here. Nobody objected to the military. I wasn\u0027t afraid of it, either. Back then there was nothing to be afraid of. We were the U.S., right? We were going to whip the ass off those slanty-eyed gooks, six months maximum. Nobody was worried about going. It just seemed old-fashioned. We all respected it, we all loved the stories, but it seemed like yesterday\u0027s thing, you know what I mean? I wanted to go into business. I wanted to build my dad\u0027s yard up into a big corporation. That seemed like the thing to do. To me, that seemed like more of an American thing than going into the military. Back then, it seemed just as patriotic.\" \"So you beat the draft?\" Reacher asked. Steven nodded. \"Draft board called me, but I had college applications pending and they skipped right over me. My dad was close to the board chairman, which didn\u0027t hurt any, I guess.\" \"How did Victor react to that?\" \"He was fine with it. There was no issue about it. I wasn\u0027t antiwar or anything. I supported Vietnam, same as anybody else. It was just a personal choice, yesterday\u0027s thing or tomorrow\u0027s thing. I wanted tomorrow\u0027s thing, Victor wanted the Army. He kind of knew it was kind of, well, staid. Truth is, he was pretty much influenced by his old man. He was four-F in World War Two. Mine was a foot soldier, went to the Pacific. Victor kind of felt his family hadn\u0027t done its bit. So he wanted to do it, like a duty. Sounds stuffy now, right? Duty? But we all thought like that, back then. No comparison at all with the kids of today. We were all pretty serious and old-fashioned around here, Victor maybe slightly more than the rest of us. Very serious, very earnest. But not really a whole lot out of the ordinary.\" Reacher was three-quarters through with the bags. He stopped and rested against the pickup door. \"Was he smart?\" \"Smart enough, I guess,\" Steven said. \"He did well in school, without exactly setting the world on fire. We had a few kids here, over the years, gone to be lawyers or doctors or whatever. One of them went to NASA, a bit younger than Victor and me. Victor was smart enough, but he had to work to get his grades, as I recall.\" Reacher started with the bags again. He had filled the farthest shelves first, which he was glad about, because his forearms were starting to burn. \"Was he ever in any kind of trouble?\" Steven looked impatient. \"Trouble? You haven\u0027t been listening to me, mister. Victor was straight as an arrow, back when the worst kid would look like a complete angel today.\" Six bags to go. Reacher wiped his palms on his pants. \"What was he like when you last saw him? Between the two tours?\" Steven paused to think about it. \"A little older, I guess. I\u0027d grown up a year, it seemed like he\u0027d grown up five. But he was no different. Same guy. Still serious, still earnest. They gave him a parade when he came home, because he had a medal. He was real embarrassed about it, said the medal was nothing. Then he went away again, and he never came back.\" \"How did you feel about that?\" Steven paused again. \"Pretty bad, I guess. This was a guy I\u0027d known all my life. I\u0027d have preferred him to come back, of course, but I was real glad he didn\u0027t come back in a wheelchair or something, like a lot of them did.\" Reacher finished the work. He butted the last bag into position on the shelf with the heel of his hand and leaned on the post opposite Steven. \"What about the mystery? About what happened to him?\" Steven shook his head and smiled, sadly. \"There\u0027s no mystery. He was killed. This is about two old folks refusing to accept three unpleasant truths, is all.\" \"Which are?\" \"Simple,\" Steven said. \"Truth one is their boy died. Truth two is he died out there in some godforsaken impenetrable jungle where nobody will ever find him. Truth three is the government got dishonest around that time, and they stopped listing the MIAs as casualties, so they could keep the numbers reasonable. There were what? Maybe ten boys on Vic\u0027s chopper when it went down? That\u0027s ten names they kept off the nightly news. It was a policy, and it\u0027s too late for them to admit to anything now.\" \"That\u0027s your take?\" \"Sure is,\" Steven said. \"The war went bad, and the government went bad with it. Hard enough for my generation to accept, let me tell you. You younger guys are probably more at home with it, but you better believe the old folk like the Hobies are never going to square up to it.\" He lapsed into silence, and glanced absently back and forth between the empty pickup and the full shelves. \"That\u0027s a ton of cement you shifted. You want to come in and wash up and let me buy you a soda?\" \"I need to eat,\" Reacher said. \"I missed lunch.\" Steven nodded, and then he smiled, ruefully. \"Head south. There\u0027s a diner right after the train station. That\u0027s where we used to drink milk shakes, half past nine Saturday night, thinking we were practically Frank Sinatra.\" THE DINER HAD obviously changed many times since daring boys with baseball cards in the wheels of their bicycles had sipped milk shakes there on Saturday nights. Now it was a seventies-style eaterie, low and square, a brick facade, green roof, with a nineties-style gloss in the form of elaborate neon signs in every window, hot pinks and blues. Reacher took the leather-bound folder with him and pulled the door and stepped into chilly air smelling of freon and burgers and the strong stuff they squirt on the tables before wiping them down. He sat at the counter and a cheerful heavy girl of twenty-something boxed him in with flatware and a napkin and handed him a menu card the size of a billboard with photographs of the food positioned next to the written descriptions. He ordered a half-pounder, Swiss, rare, slaw and onion rings, and made a substantial wager with himself that it wouldn\u0027t resemble the photograph in any way at all. Then he drank his ice water and got a refill before opening the folder. He concentrated on Victor\u0027s letters to his folks. There were twenty-seven of them in total, thirteen from his training postings and fourteen from Vietnam. They bore out everything he\u0027d heard from Ed Steven. Accurate grammar, accurate spelling, plain, terse phrasing. The same handwriting used by everybody educated in America between the twenties and the sixties, but with a backward slant. A left-handed person. None of the twenty-seven letters ran more than a few lines over the page. A dutiful person. A person who knew it was considered impolite to end a personal letter on the first page. A polite, dutiful, left-handed, dull, conventional, normal person, solidly educated, but no kind of a rocket scientist. The girl brought him the burger. It was adequate in itself, but very different from the gigantic feast depicted in the photograph on the menu. The slaw was floating in whitened vinegar in a crimped paper cup, and the onion rings were bloated and uniform, like small brown automobile tires. The Swiss was sliced so thin it was transparent, but it tasted like cheese. The photograph taken after the passing-out parade down at Rucker was harder to interpret. The focus was off, and the peak of his cap put Victor\u0027s eyes into deep shadow. His shoulders were back, and his body was tense. Bursting with pride, or embarrassed by his mother? It was hard to tell. In the end, Reacher voted for pride, because of the mouth. It was a tight line, slightly down at the edges, the sort of mouth that needs firm control from the facial muscles to stop a huge joyful grin. This was a photograph of a guy at the absolute peak of his life so far. Every goal attained, every dream realized. Two weeks later, he was overseas. Reacher shuffled through the letters for the note from Mobile. It was written from a bunk, before sailing. Mailed by a company clerk in Alabama. Sober phrases, a page and a quarter. Emotions tightly checked. It communicated nothing at all. He paid the check and left the girl a two-dollar tip for being so cheerful. Would she have written home a page-and-a-quarter of tight-assed nothingness the day she was sailing off to war? No, but she would never sail off to war. Victor\u0027s helicopter went down maybe seven years before she was born, and Vietnam was just something she had suffered through in eleventh-grade history class. It was way too early to head straight back to Wall Street. Jodie had said seven o\u0027clock. At least two hours to kill, minimum. He slid into the Taurus and put the air on high to blow the heat away. Then he flattened the Hertz map on the stiff leather of the folder and traced a route away from Brighton. He could take Route 9 south to the Bear Mountain Parkway, the Bear east to the Taconic, the Taconic south to the Sprain, and the Sprain would dump him out on the Bronx River Parkway. That road would take him straight down to the Botanical Gardens, which was a place he had never been, and a place he was pretty keen to visit. MARILYN GOT TO her lunch a little after three o\u0027clock. She had checked the cleaning crew\u0027s work before she let them leave, and they had done a perfect job. They had used a steam-cleaner on the hall rug, not because it was dirty, but because it was the best way of raising up the dents in the pile left by the credenza\u0027s feet. The steam swelled the wool fibers, and after a thorough vacuuming nobody was ever going to know a heavy piece of furniture had once rested there. She took a long shower and wiped out the stall with a kitchen towel to leave the tiling dry and shiny. She combed her hair and left it to air-dry. She knew the June humidity would put a slight curl in it. Then she got dressed, which involved one garment only. She put on Chester\u0027s favorite thing, a dark pink silk sheath which worked best with nothing on underneath. It came just above the knee, and although it wasn\u0027t exactly tight, it clung in all the right places, as if it had been made for her, which in fact it had been, although Chester wasn\u0027t aware of that. He thought it was just a lucky off-the-peg accident. She was happy to let him think that, not because of the money, but because it felt a little, well, brazen to admit to having such a sexy thing custom-made. And the effect on him was, frankly, brazen. It was like a trigger. She used it when she thought he needed rewarding. Or deflecting. And he was going to need deflecting tonight. He was going to arrive home and find his house up for sale and his wife in charge. Any old way she looked at it, it was going to be a difficult evening, and she was prepared to use any advantage she could to get through it, brazen or not. She chose the Gucci heels which matched the sheath\u0027s color and made her legs look long. Then she went down to the kitchen and ate her lunch, which was an apple and a square of reduced-fat cheese, and then she went back upstairs and brushed her teeth again and thought about makeup. Being naked under the dress and with her hair down in a natural style, the way to go was really no makeup at all, but she was prepared to admit she was just a little way past being able to get away with that, so she set out on the long haul of making herself up so she would look like she hadn\u0027t troubled to. It took her twenty minutes; and then she did her nails, toes too, because she felt that counted when it was likely her shoes would be coming off early. Then she dabbed her favorite perfume on, enough to be noticed without being overwhelming. Then the phone rang. It was Sheryl. \"Marilyn?\" she said. \"Six hours on the market, and you\u0027ve got a nibble!\" \"I have? But who? And how?\" \"I know, the very first day, before you\u0027re even listed anywhere, isn\u0027t it wonderful? It\u0027s a gentleman who\u0027s relocating with his family, and he was cruising the area, getting a feel for it, and he saw your sign. He came straight over here for the particulars. Are you ready? Can I bring him right over?\" \"Wow, right now? Already? This is quick, isn\u0027t it? But yes, I guess I\u0027m ready. Who is it, Sheryl? You think he\u0027s a serious buyer?\" \"Definitely I do, and he\u0027s only here today. He has to go back west tonight.\" \"OK, well, bring him on over, I guess. I\u0027ll be ready.\" She realized she must have been rehearsing the whole routine, unconsciously, without really being aware of it. She moved fast, but she wasn\u0027t flustered. She hung up the phone and ran straight down to the kitchen and switched the oven on low. Spooned a heap of coffee beans onto a saucer and placed them on the middle shelf. Shut the oven door and turned to the sink. Dropped the apple core into the waste disposal and stacked the plate in the dishwasher. Wiped the sink down with a paper towel and stood back, hands on hips, scanning the room. She walked to the window and angled the blind until the light caught the shine on the floor. \"Perfect,\" she said to herself. She ran back up the stairs and started at the top of the house. She ducked into every room, scanning, checking, adjusting flowers, angling blinds, plumping pillows. She turned lamps on everywhere. She had read that to turn them on after the buyer was already in the room was a clear message the house was gloomy. Better to have them on from the outset, which was a clear message of cheerful welcome. She ran back down the stairs. In the family room, she opened the blind all the way to show off the pool. In the den, she turned on the reading lamps and tilted the blind almost closed, to give a dark, comfortable look. Then she ducked into the living room. Shit, Chester\u0027s side-table was still there. right next to where his armchair had been. How could she have missed that? She grabbed it two-handed and ran with it to the basement stairs. She heard Sheryl\u0027s car on the gravel. She opened the basement door and ran down and dumped the table and ran back up. Closed the door on it and ducked into the powder room. Straightened the guest towel and dabbed at her hair and checked herself in the mirror. God! She was wearing her silk sheath. With nothing underneath. The silk was clinging to her skin. What the hell was this poor guy going to think? The doorbell rang. She was frozen. Did she have time to change? Of course not. They were at the door, right now, ringing the bell. A jacket or something? The doorbell rang again. She took a breath and shook her hips to loosen the fabric and walked down the hall. Took another breath and opened the door. Sheryl beamed in at her, but Marilyn was already looking at the buyer. He was a tallish man, maybe fifty or fifty-five, gray, in a dark suit, standing side-on, looking out and back at the plantings along the driveway. She glanced down at his shoes, because Chester always said wealth and breeding shows up on the feet. These looked pretty good. Heavy Oxfords, polished to a shine. She started a smile. Was this going to be it? Sold within six hours? That would be a hell of a thing. She smiled a quick conspirator\u0027s smile with Sheryl and turned to the man. \"Come in,\" she said brightly, and held out her hand. He turned back from the garden to face her. He stared straight at her, frankly and blatantly. She felt naked under his gaze. She practically was naked. But she found herself staring right back at him, because he was terribly burned. One side of his head was just a mass of shiny pink scars. She kept her polite smile frozen in place and kept her hand extended toward him. He paused. Brought his hand up to meet it. But it wasn\u0027t a hand. It was a shining metal hook. Not an artificial hand, not a clever prosthetic device, just a wicked metal curve made of gleaming steel. REACHER WAS AT the curb outside the sixty-story building on Wall Street ten minutes before seven o\u0027clock. He kept the motor running and scanned a triangle that had its point on the building\u0027s exit door and spread sideways across the plaza past the distance where somebody could get to her before he could. There was nobody inside the triangle who worried him. Nobody static, nobody watching, just a thin stream of office workers jostling out to the street, jackets over their arms, bulky briefcases in their hands. Most of them were making a left on the sidewalk, heading for the subway. Some of them were threading through the cars at the curb, looking for cabs out in the traffic stream. The other parked cars were harmless. There was a UPS truck two places ahead, and a couple of livery vehicles with drivers standing next to them, scanning for their passengers. Innocent bustle, at the weary end of a busy day. Reacher settled back in his seat to wait, his eyes flicking left and right, ahead and behind, always returning to the revolving door. She came out before seven, which was sooner than he expected. He saw her through the glass, in the lobby. He saw her hair, and her dress, and the flash of her legs as she skipped sideways to the exit. He wondered for a second if she had just been waiting up on her high floor. The timing was plausible. She could have seen the car from her window, gone straight to the elevator. She pushed the door and spilled out onto the plaza. He got out of the car and moved around the hood to the sidewalk and stood waiting. She was carrying the pilot\u0027s case. She skipped through a shaft of sun and her hair lit up like a halo. Ten yards from him, she smiled. \"Hello, Reacher,\" she called. \"Hello, Jodie,\" he said. She knew something. He could see it in her face. She had big news for him, but she was smiling like she was going to tease him with it. \"What?\" he asked. She smiled again and shook her head. \"You first, OK?\" They sat in the car and he ran through everything the old couple had told him. Her smile faded and she turned somber. Then he gave her the leather-bound folder and left her to scan through it while he fought the traffic in a narrow counterclockwise square that left them facing south on Broadway, two blocks from her place. He pulled in at the curb outside an espresso bar. She was reading the reconnaissance report from Rutter and studying the photograph of the emaciated gray man and the Asian soldier. \"Incredible,\" she said, quietly. \"Give me your keys,\" he said back. \"Get a coffee and I\u0027ll walk up for you when I know your building\u0027s OK.\" She made no objection. The photograph had shaken her up. She just went into her bag for her keys and got out of the car and skipped straight across the sidewalk and into the coffee shop. He watched her inside and then eased south down the street. He turned directly into her garage. It was a different car, and he figured if anybody was waiting down there they would hesitate long enough to give him all the advantage he would need. But the garage was quiet. Just the same group of parked vehicles, looking like they hadn\u0027t moved all day. He put the Taurus in her slot and went up the metal stairs to the lobby. Nobody there. Nobody in the elevator, nobody in the fourth-floor hallway. Her door was undamaged. He opened it up and stepped inside. Quiet, still air. Nobody there. He used the fire stairs to get back to the lobby and went out the glass doors to the street. Walked the two blocks north and ducked into the coffee shop and found her alone at a chrome table, reading Victor Hobie\u0027s letters, an espresso untouched at her elbow. \"You going to drink that?\" he asked. She stacked the jungle photograph on top of the letters. \"This has big implications,\" she said. He took that for a no, and pulled the cup over and swallowed the coffee in one mouthful. It had cooled slightly and was wonderfully strong. \"Let\u0027s go,\" she said. She let him carry her case and took his arm for the two-block walk. He gave back her keys at the street door and they went in through the lobby together and up in the elevator in silence. She unlocked the apartment door and went inside ahead of him. \"So it\u0027s government people after us,\" she said. He made no reply. Just shrugged off his new jacket and dropped it on the sofa under the Mondrian copy. \"Has to be,\" she said. He walked to the windows and cracked the blinds. Shafts of daylight poured in and the white room glowed. \"We\u0027re close to the secret of these camps,\" she said. \"So the government is trying to silence us. CIA or somebody.\" He walked through to the kitchen. Pulled the refrigerator door and took out a bottle of water. \"We\u0027re in serious danger,\" she said. \"You don\u0027t seem very worried about it \" He shrugged and took a swallow of water. It was too cold. He preferred it room temperature. \"Life\u0027s too short for worrying,\" he said. \"Dad was worrying. It was making his heart worse.\" He nodded. \"I know. I\u0027m sorry.\" \"So why aren\u0027t you taking it seriously? Don\u0027t you believe it?\" \"I believe it,\" he said. \"I believe everything they told me.\" \"And the photograph proves it, right? The place obviously exists.\" \"I know it exists,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve been there.\" She stared at him. \"You\u0027ve been there? When? How?\" \"Not long ago,\" he said. \"I got just about as close as this Rutter guy got.\" \"Christ, Reacher,\" she said. \"So what are you going to do about it?\" \"I\u0027m going to buy a gun.\" \"No, we should go to the cops. Or the newspapers, maybe. The government can\u0027t do this.\" \"You wait for me here, OK?\" \"Where are you going?\" \"I\u0027m going to buy a gun. Then I\u0027ll buy us some pizza. I\u0027ll bring it back.\" \"You can\u0027t buy a gun, not in New York City, for God\u0027s sake. There are laws. You need ID and permits and things and you\u0027ve got to wait five days anyway.\" \"I can buy a gun anywhere,\" he said. \"Especially New York City. What do you want on the pizza?\" \"Have you got enough money?\" \"For the pizza?\" \"For the gun,\" she said. \"The gun will cost me less than the pizza,\" he said. \"Lock the door behind me, OK? And don\u0027t open it unless you see it\u0027s me in the spy hole.\" He left her standing in the center of the kitchen. He used the fire stairs to the lobby and stood in the bustle on the sidewalk long enough to get himself lined up with the geography. There was a pizza parlor on the block to the south. He ducked inside and ordered a large pie, half anchovies and capers, half hot pepperoni, to go in thirty minutes. Then he dodged traffic on Broadway and struck out east. He\u0027d been in New York enough times to know what people say is true. Everything happens fast in New York. Things change fast. Fast in terms of chronology, and fast in terms of geography. One neighborhood shifts into another within a couple of blocks. Sometimes, the front of a building is a middle-class paradise, and around the back bums are sleeping in the alley. He knew a fast ten-minute walk was going to take him worlds away from Jodie\u0027s expensive apartment block. He found what he was looking for in the shadows under the approach to the Brooklyn Bridge. There was a messy tangle of streets crouching there, and a giant housing project sprawling to the north and east. Some ragged cluttered stores, and a basketball court with chains under the hoops instead of nets. The air was hot and damp and filled with fumes and noise. He turned a comer and stood leaning on the chain-link with the basketball noises behind him, watching two worlds collide. There was a rapid traffic flow of vehicles driving and people walking fast, and an equal quantity of cars stopped and idling and people standing around in bunches. The moving cars tacked around the stopped ones, honking and swerving, and the walking people pushed and complained and dodged into the gutter to pass the knots of loiterers. Sometimes a car would stop short and a boy would dart forward to the driver\u0027s window. There would be a short conversation and money would change hands like a conjuring trick and the boy would dart back to a doorway and disappear. He would reappear a moment later and hustle back to the car. The driver would glance left and right and accept a small package and force back into the traffic in a burble of exhaust and a blast of horns. Then the boy would return to the sidewalk and wait. Sometimes the trade was on foot, but the system was always the same. The boys were the cut-outs. They carried the money in and the packages out, and they were too young to go to trial. Reacher was watching them use three doorways in particular, spaced out along the block frontage. The center of the three was doing the busiest trade. About two-to-one, in terms of commercial volume. It was the eleventh building, counting up from the south corner. He pushed off the fence and turned east. There was a vacant lot ahead which gave him a glimpse of the river. The bridge soared over his head. He turned north and came up behind the buildings in a narrow alley. Scanned ahead as he walked and counted eleven fire escapes. Dropped his glance to ground level and saw a black sedan jammed into the narrow space outside the eleventh rear entrance. There was a boy of maybe nineteen sitting on the trunk lid, with a mobile phone in his hand. The back-door guard, one step up the promotion ladder from his baby brothers shuttling back and forward across the sidewalk. There was nobody else around. The boy was on his own. Reacher stepped into the alley. The way to do it is to walk fast and focus on something way beyond your target. Make the guy feel like he\u0027s got nothing to do with anything. Reacher made a show of checking his watch and glancing far ahead into the distance. He hustled along, almost running. At the last minute, he dropped his gaze to the car, like he was suddenly dragged back into the present by the obstacle. The boy was watching him. Reacher dodged left, where he knew the angle of the car wouldn\u0027t let him through. He pulled up in exasperation and dodged right, turning with the pent-up fury of a hurrying man balked by a nuisance. He swung his left arm with the turn and hit the kid square in the side of the head. The kid toppled and he hit him again, right-handed, just a short-arm jab, relatively gentle. No reason to put him in the hospital. He let him fall off the trunk lid unaided, to see how far away he\u0027d put him. A conscious person will always break his fall. This kid didn\u0027t. He hit the alley floor with a dusty thump. Reacher rolled him over and checked his pockets. There was a gun in there, but it wasn\u0027t the sort of thing he was going to bear home in triumph. It was a Chinese.22, some imitation of a Soviet imitation of something that was probably useless to start with. He pitched it out of reach under the car. He knew the back door of the tenement would be unlocked, because that\u0027s the point of a back door when you\u0027re doing a roaring trade about 150 yards south of Police Plaza. They come in the front, you need to be able to get out the back without fumbling for the key. He inched it open with his toe and stood gazing into the gloom. There was an inner door off the back hallway, leading to the right, into a room with a light on inside. It was about ten paces away. No point in waiting. They weren\u0027t about to take a dinner break. He walked ahead ten paces and stopped at the door. The building stank of decay and sweat and urine. It was quiet. An abandoned building. He listened. There was a low voice inside the room. Then an answer to it. Two people, minimum. Swinging the door open and standing and taking stock of the scene inside is not the way to do it. The guy who pauses even for a millisecond is the guy who dies earlier than his classmates. Reacher\u0027s guess was the tenement was maybe fifteen feet wide, of which three were represented by the hallway he was standing in. So he aimed to be the other twelve feet into the room before they even knew he was there. They would still be looking at the door, wondering who else was coming in after him. He took a breath and burst through the door like it wasn\u0027t there at all. It crashed back against the hinge and he was across the room in two huge strides. Dim light. A single electric bulb. Two men. Packages on the table. Money on the table. A handgun on the table. He hit the first guy a wide swinging roundhouse blow square on the temple. The guy fell sideways and Reacher drove through him with a knee in the gut on his way back to the second man, who was coming up out of his chair with his eyes wide and his mouth open in shock. Reacher aimed high and smacked him with a forearm smash exactly horizontal between his eyebrows and his hairline. Do it hard enough, and the guy goes down for an hour, but his skull stays in one piece. This was supposed to be a shopping trip, not an execution. He stood still and listened through the door. Nothing. The guy in the alley was sleeping and the noise on the street was occupying the kids on the sidewalk. He glanced at the table and glanced away again, because the handgun lying there was a Colt Detective Special. A six-shot,.38-caliber revolver in blued steel with black plastic grips. Stubby little two-inch barrel. No good at all. Nowhere near the sort of thing he was looking for. The short barrel was a drawback, and the caliber was a disappointment. He remembered a Louisiana cop he\u0027d met, a police captain from some small jurisdiction out in the bayou. The guy had come to the military police for firearms advice and Reacher had been detailed to deal with him. The guy had all kinds of tales of woe about the.38-caliber revolvers his men were using. He said you just can\u0027t rely on them to put a guy down, not if he\u0027s coming at you all pumped up on angel dust. He told a story about a suicide. The guy needed five shots to the head with a.38 to put himself away. Reacher had been impressed by the guy\u0027s unhappy face and he had decided then and there to stay away from.38s, which was a policy he was not about to change now. So he turned his back on the table and stood still and listened again. Nothing. He squatted next to the guy he\u0027d hit in the head and started through his jacket. The busiest dealers make the most money, and the most money buys the best toys, which was why he was in this building, and not in one of the slower rivals up or down the street. He found exactly what he wanted in the guy\u0027s left-hand inner pocket. Something a whole lot better than a puny.38 Detective Special. It was a big black automatic, a Steyr GB, a handsome nine-millimeter which had been a big favorite of his Special Forces friends through most of his career. He pulled it out and checked it over. The magazine had all eighteen shells in it and the chamber smelled like it had never been fired. He pulled the trigger and watched the mechanism move. Then he reassembled the gun and jammed it under his belt in the small of his back and smiled. Stayed down next to the unconscious guy and whispered, \"I\u0027ll buy your Steyr for a buck. Just shake your head if you\u0027ve got a problem with that, OK?\" Then he smiled again and stood up. Peeled a dollar bill off his roll and left it weighted down on the tabletop under the Detective Special. Stepped back to the hallway. All quiet. He made the ten paces to the back and came out into the light. Checked left and right up and down the alley and stepped over to the parked sedan. Opened the driver\u0027s door and found the lever and popped the trunk. There was a black nylon sports bag in there, empty. A small cardboard box of nine-millimeter reloads under a tangle of red and black jump leads. He put the ammunition in the bag and walked away with it. The pizza was waiting for him when he arrived back on Broadway. IT WAS SUDDEN. It happened without warning. As soon as they were inside and the door was closed, the man hit Sheryl, a vicious backhand blow to the face with whatever was inside his empty sleeve. Marilyn was frozen with shock. She saw the man twisting violently and the hook swinging through its glittering arc and she heard the wet crunch as his arm hit Sheryl\u0027s face and she clamped both hands over her mouth as if it were somehow vitally important she didn\u0027t scream. She saw the man spinning back toward her and reaching up under his right armpit and coming out with a gun in his left hand. She saw Sheryl going over backward and sprawling on the rug, right where it was still damp from the steam cleaning. She saw the gun arcing at her along the exact same radius he had used before, but in the reverse direction, coming straight at her. The gun was made of dark metal, gray, dewed with oil. It was dull, but it shone. It stopped level with her chest, and she stared down at its color, and all she could think was: that\u0027s what they mean when they say gunmetal. \"Step closer,\" the man said. She was paralyzed. Her hands were clamped to her face and her eyes were open so wide she thought the skin on her face would tear. \"Closer,\" the man said again. She stared down at Sheryl. She was struggling up on her elbows. Her eyes were crossed and blood was running from her nose. Her top lip was swelling and the blood was dripping off her chin. Her knees were up and her skirt was rucked. She could see her panty hose change from thin to thick at the top. Her breathing was ragged. Then her elbows gave way again and slid forward and her knees splayed out. Her head hit the floor with a soft thump and rolled sideways. \"Step closer,\" the man said. She stared at his face. It was rigid. The scars looked like hard plastic. One eye was hooded under an eyelid as thick and coarse as a thumb. The other was cold and unblinking. She stared at the gun. It was a foot away from her chest. Not moving. The hand that held it was smooth. The nails were manicured. She stepped forward a quarter step. \"Closer.\" She slid her feet forward until the gun was touching the fabric of her dress. She felt the hardness and the coldness of the gray metal through the thin silk. \"Closer.\" She stared at him. His face was a foot away from hers. On the left the skin was gray and lined. The good eye was webbed with lines. The right eye blinked. The eyelid was slow and heavy. It went down, then up, deliberately, like a machine. She leaned forward an inch. The gun pressed into her breast. \"Closer.\" She moved her feet. He answered with matching pressure on the gun. The metal was pressing hard into the softness of her flesh. It was crushing her breast. The silk was yielding into a deep crater. It was pulling her nipple sideways. It was hurting her. The man raised his right arm. The hook. He held it up in front of her eyes. It was a plain steel curve, rubbed and polished until it shone. He rotated it slowly, with an awkward movement of his forearm. She heard leather inside his sleeve. The tip of the hook was machined to a point. He rotated the tip away and laid the flat of the curve against her forehead. She flinched. It was cold. He scraped it down her forehead and traced the curve of her nose. In under her nose. He pressed it against her top lip. Brought it down and in and pressed until her mouth opened. He tapped it gently against her teeth. It caught on her bottom lip, because her lip was dry. He dragged her lip down with the steel until the soft rubbery flesh pulled free. He traced over the curve of her chin. Down under her chin to her throat. Up again an inch, and back, under the shelf of her jaw, until he was forcing her head up with the strength in his shoulder. He stared into her eyes. \"My name is Hobie,\" he said. She was up on tiptoes, trying to take the weight off her throat. She was starting to gag. She couldn\u0027t remember taking a breath since she had opened the door. \"Did Chester mention me?\" Her head was tilting upward. She was staring at the ceiling. The gun was digging into her breast. It was no longer cold. The heat of her body had warmed it. She shook her head, a small urgent motion, balanced on the pressure of the hook. \"He didn\u0027t mention me?\" \"No,\" she gasped. \"Why? Should he have?\" \"Is he a secretive man?\" She shook her head again. The same small urgent motion, side to side, the skin of her throat snagging left and right against the metal. \"Did he tell you about his business problems?\" She blinked. Shook her head again. \"So he is a secretive man.\" \"I guess,\" she gasped. \"But I knew anyway.\" \"Does he have a girlfriend?\" She blinked again. Shook her head. \"How can you be sure?\" Hobie asked. \"If he\u0027s a secretive man?\" \"What do you want?\" she gasped. \"But I guess he doesn\u0027t need a girlfriend. You\u0027re a very beautiful woman.\" She blinked again. She was up on her toes. The Gucci heels were off the ground. \"I just paid you a compliment,\" Hobie said. \"Oughtn\u0027t you say something in response? Politely?\" He increased the pressure. The steel dug into the flesh of her throat. One foot came free of the ground. \"Thank you,\" she gasped. The hook eased down. Her eye line came back to the horizontal and her heels touched the rug. She realized she was breathing. She was panting, in and out, in and out. \"A very beautiful woman.\" He dropped the hook away from her throat. It touched her waist. Traced down over the curve of her hip. Down over her thigh. He was staring at her face. The gun was jammed hard in her flesh. The hook turned, and the flat face of the curve lifted off her thigh, leaving just the point behind. It traced downward. She felt it slide off the silk onto her bare leg. It was sharp. Not like a needle. Like a pencil point. It stopped moving. It started back up. He was pressing with it, gently. It wasn\u0027t cutting her. She knew that. But it was furrowing against the firmness of her skin. It moved up. It slid under the silk. She felt the metal on the skin of her thigh. It moved up. She could feel the silk of her dress bunching and gathering in the radius of the hook. The hook moved up. The back of the hem was sliding up the backs of her legs. Sheryl stirred on the floor. The hook stopped moving and Hobie\u0027s awful right eye swiveled slowly across and down. \"Put your hand in my pocket,\" he said. She stared at him. \"Your left hand,\" he said. \"My right pocket.\" She had to move closer and reach over and down between his arms. Her face was close to his. He smelled of soap. She felt around to his pocket. Darted her fingers inside and closed them over a small cylinder. Slid it out. It was a used roll of duct tape, an inch in diameter. Silver. Maybe five yards remaining. Hobie stepped away from her. \"Tape Sheryl\u0027s wrists together,\" he said. She wriggled her hips to make the hem of her dress fall down into place. He watched her do it and smiled. She glanced between the roll of silver tape and Sheryl, down on the floor. \"Turn her over,\" he said. The light from the window was catching the gun. She knelt next to Sheryl. Pulled on one shoulder and pushed on the other until she flopped over on her front. \"Put her elbows together,\" he said. She hesitated. He raised the gun a fraction, and then the hook, arms wide, a display of superior weaponry. She grimaced. Sheryl stirred again. Her blood had pooled on the rug. It was brown and sticky. Marilyn used both hands and forced her elbows together, behind her back. Hobie looked down. \"Get them real close,\" he said. She picked at the tape with her nail and got a length free. Wrapped it around and around Sheryl\u0027s forearms, just below her elbows. \"Tight,\" he said. \"All the way up.\" She wound the tape around and around, up above her elbows and down to her wrists. Sheryl was stirring and struggling. \"OK, sit her up,\" Hobie said. She dragged her into a sitting position with her taped arms behind her. Her face was masked in blood. Her nose was swollen, going blue. Her lips were puffy. \"Put tape on her mouth,\" Hobie said. She used her teeth and bit off a six-inch length. Sheryl was blinking and focusing. Marilyn shrugged unhappily at her, like a helpless apology, and stuck the tape over her mouth. It was thick tape, with tough reinforcing threads baked into the silver plastic coating. It was shiny, but not slippery, because of the raised crisscross threads. She rubbed her fingers side to side across them to make it stick. Sheryl\u0027s nose started bubbling and her eyes opened wide in panic. \"God, she can\u0027t breathe,\" Marilyn gasped. She went to rip the tape off again, but Hobie kicked her hand away. \"You broke her nose,\" Marilyn said. \"She can\u0027t breathe.\" The gun was pointing down at her head. Held steady. Eighteen inches away. \"She\u0027s going to die,\" Marilyn said. \"That\u0027s for damn sure,\" Hobie said back. She stared up at him in horror. Blood was rasping and bubbling in Sheryl\u0027s fractured airways. Her eyes were staring in panic. Her chest was heaving. Hobie\u0027s eyes were on Marilyn\u0027s face. \"You want me to be nice?\" he asked. She nodded wildly. \"Are you going to be nice back?\" She stared at her friend. Her chest was convulsing, heaving for air that wasn\u0027t there. Her head was shaking from side to side. Hobie leaned down and turned the hook so the point was rasping across the tape on Sheryl\u0027s mouth as her head jerked back and forth. Then he jabbed hard and forced the point through the silver. Sheryl froze. Hobie moved his arm, left and right, up and down. Pulled the hook back out. There was a ragged hole left in the tape, with air whistling in and out. The tape sucked and blew against her lips as Sheryl gasped and panted. \"I was nice,\" Hobie said. \"So now you owe me, OK?\" Sheryl\u0027s breathing was sucking hard through the hole in the tape. She was concentrating on it. Her eyes were squinting down, like she was confirming there was air in front of her to use. Marilyn was watching her, sitting back on her heels, cold with terror. \"Help her to the car,\" Hobie said.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tripwire-jack-reacher-3/page-9.html","bookId":2341,"book":{"id":2341,"title":"Tripwire (Jack Reacher #3)","description":"Storyline: Tripwire (Jack Reacher #3) Jack Reacher, ex-military policeman relaxed in Key West until Costello turned up dead.
