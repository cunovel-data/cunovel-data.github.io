Still, he\u0027s managed to find numerous inventive ways to occupy his waking hours. \n Tanner is a card-carrying member of hundreds of international organizations, from the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Order to the Flat Earth Society—not because he believes in their myriad lost causes, he\u0027s simply a joiner by nature. Besides, it gives him something to do. \n The Russians think Tanner is a CIA operative on a covert mission. The CIA is certain he\u0027s a Soviet agent. Actually, he\u0027s in Turkey pursuing a fortune in hidden Armenian gold. But Tanner\u0027s up for anything, including a little spycraft, if it helps him reach his big payday. And if need be, he\u0027ll even start a small revolution . . .\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-thief-who-couldn-t-sleep-evan-tanner-1.jpg","author":"Lawrence Block","type":"Mystery","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":27,"category":{"id":19,"name":"Mystery","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
