There\u0027s been a mistake.\"\\n\\n The zombies - and that\u0027s what they are now, all human semblance discarded - don\u0027t reply. They\u0027re shuffling closer, eyes steady, ready to feed.\\n\\n \"Get back,\" I snarl, leaping to my feet and pushing Cathy away. I step between Mark and the others. \"You\u0027re not going to do this. I\u0027m hungry too. I can smell him just like you can, and it\u0027s driving me wild. But I won\u0027t harm him and I won\u0027t let you lot either. You have to control yourselves. This is Mark.\"\\n\\n \"Worm,\" Cathy gurgles, grinning crookedly. \"Wriggle, little worm.\"\\n\\n \"No!\" I roar, slamming my hands together, trying to startle them back to their senses. \"Stop. Think. Don\u0027t give in to the hunger. Peder. Gokhan. Tiberius.\" I turn pleadingly to the ginger-haired teenager. \"You stood by my side. You fought for my life. Do the same for Mark. You have to. He\u0027s one of us.\" A memory clicks in. \"We accept him! Gooble gobble!\"\\n\\n Tiberius pauses and his eyes clear slightly.\\n\\n \"It must have been an experiment,\" I babble. \"They wanted to see if they could hide a human among us. They told him he was a zombie. They covered him up so that we couldn\u0027t smell him, hear his heartbeat or see him breathing. They must have given him drugs to keep his eyes open, dry out his mouth, stop him from sweating, make him look like he was a revitalized.\"\\n\\n \"But he\u0027s not,\" Peder growls. \"He\u0027s human.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t know,\" Mark wails. \"I thought... they told me... I never even guessed! B, you\u0027ve got to stop them. Don\u0027t let them eat me. Please, B, I want to live, I don\u0027t want to - \"\\n\\n \"Shh. I\u0027m trying.\" I concentrate on Tiberius, hoping that if I can reach him, he can help me get through to the rest of them. \"All right, he\u0027s not a proper zom head, but he\u0027s still one of us. He\u0027s been living alongside you guys for months. You can\u0027t turn on him as if he doesn\u0027t mean anything to you.\"\\n\\n \"Worm,\" Cathy leers again, reaching out for the trembling boy.\\n\\n I slap her hands away. \"I know you don\u0027t respect him, you bully him, you treat him like a worm. But he\u0027s still part of the gang. You won\u0027t attack one of your own. You\u0027re not monsters. It\u0027s the hunger. You have to fight it. You - \"\\n\\n Gokhan smashes a fist into my jaw and I stagger sideways. Mark shrieks and the sound excites them. They press forward. Before they can target him, I\u0027m back between them, punching and kicking, screaming abusively. I\u0027m not going to accept this. I let Tyler Bayor die. I won\u0027t let it happen to Mark too.\\n\\n \"Stop!\" I yell. \"You don\u0027t know what you\u0027re doing!\"\\n\\n Peder grabs the neck of my T-shirt and pulls me in close. His eyes flash as he grins at me. \"Yes we do,\" he hisses.\\n\\n \"Tiberius!\" I bellow. \"Help me! We have to fight together! You have to - \"\\n\\n Tiberius puts a finger to my lips and says, \"Hush now.\" Then he grabs me from Peder and throws me aside.\\n\\n Mark screams. \"No! God! Help!\"\\n\\n But not even God can help him now.\\n\\n The zombies fall on the boy. They dig their fingers into his skull and tear it open. Ram claws into his brain and scoop it out. They ignore his screams, his whimpers, his pleas, the feeble thrashing of his arms and legs.\\n\\n And all I can do as the beasts feast and Mark dies wretchedly before my eyes, calling my name, begging for mercy, is beat the floor uselessly with my fists and howl insanely at the cruel injustices of this monstrous, twisted world. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-underground-zom-b-2/page-24.html","bookId":2451,"book":{"id":2451,"title":"Zom-B Underground (Zom-B #2)","description":"Storyline: Zom-B Underground (Zom-B #2) \\n Waking up in a military complex, months after zombies attacked school, B has no memory of the last few months.
