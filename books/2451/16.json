{"id":80208,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"I spend my time in isolation trying to decide whether or not to tell the others about the threat we face. It should be a straightforward call - they have a right to know. But I\u0027m worried about how they\u0027ll react. They kill reviveds because they see them as monsters. If I told them that we need to eat brains to survive, and that we\u0027re being denied the gruel because of my refusal to play ball with Dr. Cerveris and Josh, they might rip me to pieces. Literally.\n I\u0027ve seen them do it to others. Killing gives them a buzz, and it\u0027s bull when they say that they only do it because they have to. There\u0027s a good chance they\u0027ll slaughter me if I tell them the truth, in the hope that Dr. Cerveris will restore their rations if I\u0027m removed from the equation. A lot of normal people would sacrifice me in a situation like this, so I can\u0027t expect too much compassion from a pack of semiliving beasts.\n Then again, maybe they deserve the benefit of the doubt. It\u0027s wrong to let them perish in ignorance. And if they kill me, what of it? I\u0027ll be brain-dead in a couple of days anyway. Why drag the rest of them down with me?\n \"Because they\u0027re bastards,\" I mutter, and brood about it some more.\n Everyone\u0027s sour as stale yogurt the next day. The lack of nutrients is kicking in big-time. The zom heads are wincing at noises, groaning as hunger pangs shoot through them. They can\u0027t understand why they\u0027re being denied the gray gloop or why they feel as rough as they do.\n \"We must have done something wrong,\" Tiberius insists as they knock the issue back and forth.\n \"Nah,\" Gokhan says. \"It\u0027s a test, innit? They want to see what we do when we get hungry.\"\n \"I\u0027ll rip Reilly\u0027s head off,\" Peder growls. \"That\u0027ll show them what I do.\"\n \"It isn\u0027t Reilly\u0027s fault,\" Danny says. \"He\u0027s not enjoying this. It\u0027s bloody Josh who\u0027s behind it.\"\n \"No it\u0027s not,\" Cathy shouts, then makes a face and lowers her voice. \"It\u0027s Dr. Cerveris. Josh doesn\u0027t have any say in how they test us. It\u0027s the scientists who decide those things. I\u0027ll ask Josh what\u0027s going on the next time I see him.\"\n \"Oh, I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll tell you,\" Tiberius simpers. \"You mean so much to him.\"\n Cathy flips him the finger, then glares at Rage. He\u0027s the calmest of everyone, watching an old episode of some American sitcom set in a bar, chuckling softly at the punch lines.\n \"I don\u0027t know why you\u0027re so happy,\" Cathy snarls. \"You\u0027re part of this too. You\u0027ll starve with the rest of us, no matter how many arses you kiss.\"\n \"Chill, baby,\" Rage sniffs. \"The Turk\u0027s right. They\u0027re testing us. Once they\u0027ve compiled enough data, they\u0027ll feed us again. They need us. We\u0027re their blue-eyed darlings.\"\n \"Maybe they\u0027re feeding you on the sly,\" Danny challenges him. \"Maybe that\u0027s why you don\u0027t seem bothered.\"\n \"Believe what you want,\" Rage shrugs.\n \"You never say a bad word against them, do you?\" Peder spits. \"You\u0027re a right muppet.\"\n \"I relish the easy life,\" Rage counters. \"If we scratch their backs they\u0027ll scratch ours. You don\u0027t win any prizes for rubbing against the grain. I do what they tell me, treat them with respect and reap the rewards.\"\n \"Do you call being starved a reward?\" Mark asks.\n \"Shut it, Worm,\" Rage snaps, then carries on talking to Peder as if he were the one who had asked the question. \"They\u0027ve got to treat me the same as everybody else when they\u0027re running a test, stands to reason. But in the normal run of things, by keeping them sweet, I get anything I ask for, films, games, magazines, even girls if I wanted.\"\n Danny laughs out loud, ignoring the others as they moan and slam their hands over their ears. \"Girls?\" he shrieks. \"What the hell would you want with those? We\u0027re all dead down below. We can\u0027t do anything with girls except look.\"\n \"That\u0027s why I said if I wanted,\" Rage replies smoothly.\n Mark is frowning and staring at his groin. This is news to me. I hadn\u0027t realized the boys were impotent, though now that I consider it, it makes sense - no blood flow to stir their sleeping soldiers. If the situation weren\u0027t so dire, I\u0027d have a good old chuckle about it. But they\u0027ve more important things to worry about than dodgy machinery in their boxer shorts. And on impulse, having listened to them waffle on about this all day without saying a word, I suddenly decide to solve the mystery for them.\n \"It\u0027s because of me. They\u0027re starving you because I won\u0027t torture the reviveds. And they\u0027re not gonna stop until...\"\n I draw to a halt. Everyone is staring at me, even Rage, who doesn\u0027t look so cocky anymore.\n \"Go on,\" Tiberius says stiffly.\n \"The gray junk they\u0027ve been feeding us is human brains.\"\n \"We know,\" Tiberius says.\n \"You know?\" I exclaim.\n He shrugs. \"It\u0027s obvious. We figured that out months ago. Zombies eat brains, everyone knows that.\"\n \"You never told me,\" I huff.\n \"We didn\u0027t know that we needed to,\" Tiberius sneers. \"How thick are you?\"\n \"Enough of that,\" Rage snaps, getting to his feet. He looks uneasy. \"Finish what you were going to say.\"\n \"We need the brains to stay conscious,\" I mutter. \"Without regular feeds we\u0027ll lose our senses and become reviveds again. And if we do, we can\u0027t recover, we\u0027ll be stuck like that forever.\"\n Rage stares at me coldly. Everybody else is gaping too.\n \"They told you this?\" Cathy asks.\n \"Yeah.\"\n \"And you said nothing?\" Her voice rises. \"You let them starve us, knowing what would happen, not saying a word?\"\n \"I\u0027m telling you now.\"\n \"You bitch!\" she shrieks. \"That\u0027s the first thing you should have - \"\n \"I\u0027m calling Reilly,\" Rage says heavily. \"I\u0027m gonna tell him that you\u0027ve agreed to do whatever they ask. Then we\u0027re gonna go tear some zombies to shreds and you\u0027ll hack them up, burn them, slice them into little pieces, and that will be that.\"\n \"No,\" I whisper. \"They\u0027re people. I won\u0027t do it.\"\n \"You bloody well will,\" Rage snarls, stomping towards me.\n I stand and face his challenge, hands by my sides. I don\u0027t flinch when he makes a fist and holds it threateningly in front of my face.\n \"A beating won\u0027t change my mind,\" I tell him. \"I\u0027ve been in plenty of fights, taken more than my fair share of thrashings. I took them at home too - my dad was handy with his fists, knocked me and Mum around all the time. You can smash me to a pulp, break my arms, snap my fingers, rip my ears off. It won\u0027t matter. I won\u0027t give in.\"\n \"I\u0027ll kill you,\" Rage croaks.\n \"Maybe,\" I concede. \"I\u0027ll fight back, and I think Josh will stop you before it gets that far, but if you\u0027re tough enough and fast enough, maybe you can finish me off before they intervene.\"\n \"Do it,\" Danny says flatly, stepping up beside Rage. \"I\u0027ll help.\"\n \"Me too,\" Gokhan growls.\n \"What about the rest of you?\" Rage barks.\n \"I dunno,\" Peder says, looking worried. \"She\u0027s not like the other zombies that we kill. She\u0027s one of us.\"\n \"But she won\u0027t be if they don\u0027t feed her,\" Cathy says, then frowns. \"How long before we change?\" she asks me.\n \"No one can last more than a week without being fed, so a few days at most.\"\n Cathy\u0027s face hardens. \"Kill her. If she\u0027s going to revert anyway, we should off her while we can. Otherwise we\u0027ll all turn into reviveds.\"\n \"No,\" Mark moans. \"We can\u0027t do this. It\u0027s not right. It\u0027s murder.\"\n \"But if it\u0027s us or her...\" Rage says heavily.\n Tiberius pushes past Rage and glares at me. I wait for him to condemn me too, but to my surprise he comes out with something bizarre. \"I was named after Captain Kirk in Star Trek.\"\n Everyone stares.\n \"I tell people I was named after the river in Rome, but really it was after Kirk. His full name was James Tiberius Kirk. My mum and dad loved Star Trek. They made me watch it all the time when I was growing up. Except they didn\u0027t have to make me - I loved it as much as they did. Kirk was my hero.\"\n \"Is this going somewhere, or have you lost your marbles?\" Danny huffs.\n \"Kirk always stood up for the underdog,\" Tiberius says. \"Every week, him and his crew risked their lives to save others. They killed the bad guys when they had to, but they never killed innocents, not even to save themselves.\"\n \"That was just a TV show,\" Cathy jeers.\n Tiberius nods. \"I know. But it was right. I watched Kirk, Bones and the rest of them, and I knew they were doing the right thing. I was sure I\u0027d do the same thing in their position. I used to hope that one day something dangerous would happen to me, so that I could prove how brave and loyal and human I was.\n \"Reviveds are different,\" Tiberius says, facing Rage. \"I don\u0027t think Kirk would have fought for a load of mindless, walking corpses. But Peder\u0027s right - B\u0027s one of us. If we kill her, we really will be monsters. And I\u0027m not prepared to let that happen. I\u0027ll fight with her if I have to, die with her if it comes to that.\"\n Rage holds Tiberius\u0027s gaze, deliberating. The others await his verdict. Finally he grunts and looks aside.\n \"We\u0027ll think it through some more,\" he mutters. \"I\u0027ll have a chat with Reilly, see if there\u0027s another way to sort this out. But if there isn\u0027t... well, we\u0027ll discuss that tomorrow. See how we all feel about it then.\"\n Rage returns to his couch and the others disperse, shooting me dark looks. Mark and Tiberius remain. Mark\u0027s trembling. Tiberius is stiff as a mannequin.\n \"Thanks,\" I mutter, knowing the word isn\u0027t enough.\n \"Screw you,\" Tiberius says. \"You\u0027re crazy, making a stand like this. Go away and have a rethink, then start cutting up zombies like you\u0027re told. Because if you don\u0027t, I doubt I can save you next time.\" He glances at me and I\u0027ve never seen such an expression before, torn between pride and self-loathing. \"I don\u0027t even know if I\u0027ll try.\"\n Then he storms off and Mark slips away too, leaving me alone, hated, a pariah. But, against all the odds, they didn\u0027t kill me. I\u0027m still alive.\n But not, I suspect, for long. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-underground-zom-b-2/page-16.html","bookId":2451,"book":{"id":2451,"title":"Zom-B Underground (Zom-B #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Zom-B Underground (Zom-B #2) \n Waking up in a military complex, months after zombies attacked school, B has no memory of the last few months.
