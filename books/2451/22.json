{"id":80214,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"I find another set of stairs and surge to the top. The others aren\u0027t far behind. We pause and listen closely. There are no footsteps. The mutants don\u0027t seem to be chasing us.\n I double over and make a sighing sound. I feel like I should be panting, but of course I can\u0027t, since my lungs don\u0027t work properly.\n \"Who the hell was that guy in the clown outfit?\" Cathy moans.\n \"And those freaks in the hoodies,\" Peder exclaims. \"Were they zombies? Humans? What?\"\n \"I don\u0027t think they\u0027re either,\" I tell him. \"They\u0027re mutants. They were there when my school was invaded. It looks like they work for Mr. Dowling - the clown - but I\u0027ve no idea what he is, or why they\u0027re here, or why the zombies obey them, or...\" I shake my head and scowl. \"They don\u0027t matter. We need to get out of here. We can wonder about it later.\"\n \"But what if they come after us?\" Cathy whimpers.\n \"All the more reason to get a move on,\" Tiberius grunts, and off we set again.\n Time seems to slow as we search for another set of stairs. We can\u0027t find any, and the longer we go on, the more our spirits dip. We\u0027re all in rough shape. The bits of brain we sucked from Dr. Cerveris\u0027s head didn\u0027t do much for us. The shooting pains are coming regularly now and I know the others are feeling them too by the way they wince and twitch every few minutes. My thoughts are starting to swim. It\u0027s getting harder to focus.\n \"I think we\u0027ve come the wrong way,\" Gokhan mutters. \"Just because we\u0027re underground, it don\u0027t mean the exit has to be at the top, eh? Maybe it\u0027s at the bottom, a tunnel that leads to an elevator or something.\"\n Peder frowns. \"But if we head down and don\u0027t find it, what then?\"\n \"We come back up,\" Gokhan says.\n \"That means slipping past the clown and his mutants a couple of times,\" Peder growls. \"I don\u0027t fancy that.\"\n \"Maybe we don\u0027t have to,\" Cathy says. \"There must be other flights of stairs. We\u0027ve been taking the first set that we\u0027ve found on every floor. Let\u0027s go down a level and - \"\n \"Wait,\" Mark mutters, looking at the ceiling. \"Did any of you have attic stairs at home, the sort that rest inside the attic when you\u0027re not using them?\"\n \"What sort of a question is that?\" Cathy sneers.\n \"My parents put in a set a few years ago,\" Mark says stiffly, ignoring her. \"If you have steps like that, you use a thin pole to open the door, which is part of the stairs. In our home, the hole you stuck the tip of the pole into looked just like that one up there.\"\n I squint and spot the small opening that he\u0027s talking about. \"So there\u0027s an attic. So what?\"\n \"Why would they have an attic in an underground building?\" Mark asks softly.\n I stare harder at the hole. \"You think it\u0027s something else?\"\n \"It has to be.\" He shrugs. \"I mean, it might just be a machine room or housing for an air-conditioning unit. But wouldn\u0027t they have signs up if that was the case, like they have elsewhere?\"\n \"I haven\u0027t noticed any signs,\" Peder grunts.\n \"Then you haven\u0027t been paying as much attention as me,\" Mark says smugly, then starts looking for a pole. We search too and a minute later we find one in a nearby room, tucked away in a corner.\n I try to unlock the attic door but my hands are trembling and I can\u0027t guide in the narrow tip. Peder and Tiberius try too, but both fail, their hands shaking as badly as mine.\n \"Give it to me,\" Mark snaps, losing patience, and slots it in at the first attempt. His hands are remarkably steady. He doesn\u0027t seem to be suffering like the rest of us. Maybe the doctors slipped him some nutrients on the sly when they were operating on him.\n A set of steps drops smoothly as the door opens. I feel a stab of excitement. But before I can head up, Cathy pushes me aside and I stumble and fall over. \"Ladies first,\" she chuckles.\n I scowl as she trots up, Peder, Gokhan and Tiberius just behind her. Mark helps me to my feet. \"Are you okay?\" he asks.\n \"Sure. But I\u0027m gonna give her a thumping when this is - \"\n Two soldiers and a female scientist spill into the corridor. The scientist is babbling, \"... right here. The pole\u0027s in a room. Once we open the door, we can...\" She spots Mark and me and curses.\n One of the soldiers has a gun. He aims quickly and fires. A bullet rips by my head but misses.\n \"Up the steps!\" I roar at Mark.\n The soldier fires again, three times. One of the bullets strikes Mark\u0027s left arm and blood sprays from it. He cries out and whirls away from the stairs. I duck as the soldier fires again, grab Mark and hurl him at the steps. He scrambles up them. I\u0027m about to start after him, then pause, pick up the pole and throw it up into the space ahead of me.\n A bullet hits the flesh on my back where my heart used to be. If I was whole, it would open up a nasty wound. But because I\u0027m more hole than whole in that part of my body, it only nicks a flap of skin and shoots on through the cavity and out the other side.\n I hurry after Mark and pull the steps up behind me, locking them into place. The humans scream beneath us and the soldier fires a stream of bullets into the ceiling, either trying to hit us or smash the lock. I don\u0027t hang around to find out. Pushing Mark ahead of me, I scurry after the others.\n We\u0027re in a corridor, not an attic, lit dimly by soft red lights. The dimness is a relief after the brightness of the complex. I hadn\u0027t realized how much the glare of the lights hurt.\n We shuffle along, nobody saying anything. The corridor angles upwards, then turns back on itself and keeps rising. The noises of the complex fade the farther on we push. I feel real hope for the first time. The nurse was leading the soldiers to this place and seemed desperate to reach it. Because it\u0027s a way out? Not the main exit, but a secret escape route for those of a certain rank?\n The corridor snakes around several times before the floor levels out and we step through into a large, square room. There are doorways in the middle of all four walls. Two are open, like ours, leading to corridors like the one we\u0027ve stepped out of. A metal door stands in the fourth. It\u0027s like no other door that we\u0027ve seen in the complex, taller, wider, more impressive.\n \"That must be it!\" Peder whoops, racing towards the door.\n \"The exit!\" Cathy gasps, then spins towards me. \"Do you still have the eye? You didn\u0027t drop it, did you? Tell me you didn\u0027t - \"\n I hold up my hand and widen my fingers, letting her see the eye.\n \"Yes!\" she shouts.\n I grin and push past, giving her a sharp dig with my elbow to pay her back for pushing me aside earlier. Cathy doesn\u0027t care. She only has eyes for the door.\n Gokhan presses Dr. Cerveris\u0027s fingers to the panel and it beeps. Tiberius and Peder shut their mouths as if to hold their breath, both forgetting that they can\u0027t actually breathe.\n I step forward and hold up the eye. A camera scans it. There\u0027s an agonizing pause in which I convince myself that it isn\u0027t going to work, that I\u0027ve shaken the eye around too much, dislodged something vital inside. Then...\n Beep.\n Everyone cheers as if I\u0027d just scored the winning goal in a cup final.\n The cheers stop when the system beeps again and a touch-screen calculator flashes up on the panel where Gokhan scanned in the dead doctor\u0027s fingerprints. There\u0027s a short message just below it.\n Please enter six-digit authorization code.\n We stare at the message, then at each other.\n I clear my throat. \"This is where someone says that they\u0027re a hacker and they can crack this bastard in five minutes flat.\"\n Nobody says a word.\n \"Damn,\" I sigh, sinking to my haunches. \"In that case I guess we just rot here and turn into rabid, brain-munching reviveds.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-underground-zom-b-2/page-22.html","bookId":2451,"book":{"id":2451,"title":"Zom-B Underground (Zom-B #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Zom-B Underground (Zom-B #2) \n Waking up in a military complex, months after zombies attacked school, B has no memory of the last few months.
