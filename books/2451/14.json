{"id":80206,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"There\u0027s a long silence while I come to terms with what I\u0027ve been told. This is certainly a meeting to remember. It\u0027s not every day that you find out you\u0027ve got less than two years to live, and by the way, you\u0027ve been feasting on human brains for the past month. But after my initial shock it doesn\u0027t take me long to get a handle on myself.\n \"Where do the brains come from?\" I ask.\n Burke says, \"I told you - humans.\"\n \"I mean, are you killing people in order to feed us?\"\n \"Don\u0027t be ridiculous,\" Dr. Cerveris snorts.\n \"The casualties have been horrendous,\" Josh explains. \"We can\u0027t put an exact figure on how many people have been slaughtered, but in London alone we reckon it must run into the millions.\"\n \"That\u0027s not including the hundreds of thousands who have been turned,\" Dr. Cerveris points out. \"Just those who were killed, whose heads were cracked open, so that they couldn\u0027t revive.\"\n \"We\u0027ve mopped up a lot of the corpses,\" Josh continues. \"Reviveds rarely clean out a skull - they almost always leave bits of brain behind. Ever since we realized what revitalizeds need, we\u0027ve been collecting brain matter and storing it.\"\n There\u0027s silence again. I stare at the wall above Burke\u0027s head. This wasn\u0027t how I saw my life going when I was at school. I didn\u0027t have any great career plans, but cannibalism was very far down my list of options.\n I chuckle drily and lower my gaze. \"You know what?\" I grin crookedly. \"Sod it. I always wanted to go on a TV show and eat things like bugs, snakes, roadkill. This is a dream come true. Bring it on. I\u0027ll eat whatever the hell you chuck at me.\" I rub my stomach slowly. \"Yum.\"\n Burke smirks. \"I told them you were a piece of work.\" He glances at Josh. \"I bet you\u0027re glad now that you listened to me.\"\n \"We\u0027ll see,\" Josh mutters. \"She hasn\u0027t agreed to cooperate yet.\"\n I frown, thinking back a few minutes, then turn to Burke. \"Josh said it was thanks to you that I wasn\u0027t still a zombie. What did he mean?\"\n \"I was coming to that before you sidetracked me.\" Burke crosses his hands on the table and looks at me seriously. \"Revitalizeds need brains to thrive. If we don\u0027t feed them, they regress. In most cases, the staff here let that happen.\"\n I cock my head sideways. \"Come again?\"\n \"The percentage of reviveds who revitalize is minuscule,\" Dr. Cerveris says defensively. \"But if you take a group of hundreds of thousands, even a fraction of a percent is significant.\"\n \"I figured there must be more of us,\" I say slowly, \"that adults and younger kids were being held elsewhere.\"\n \"Of course,\" Dr. Cerveris says. \"We keep a sample of all age groups, races, both sexes.\"\n \"A sample,\" I repeat, knowing what that must mean but waiting for them to confirm it.\n \"They let most revitalizeds regress,\" Burke says. His gaze hasn\u0027t wavered. \"They separate the conscious zombies, hold them in a cell, don\u0027t feed them, then return them to the general holding pens once they\u0027ve - \"\n \" - lost their bloody minds!\" I roar. I try to jump to my feet but the chains around my ankles hold me in place.\n \"There are limits to the numbers we can maintain,\" Dr. Cerveris says calmly.\n \"Bullshit!\" I retort. \"You just don\u0027t want the hassle.\"\n \"We only need a few to study and help us with our experiments,\" Josh says. \"What would we gain by keeping the others?\"\n \"They can think!\" I scream. \"They\u0027re people. They have rights.\"\n \"Rights?\" Josh sneers. \"Only the living have rights, and they\u0027re not alive, not really. You aren\u0027t either. You\u0027re a freak revived, nothing more, a threat to any normal person, never more than a few skipped feeds away from insane savagery. We keep you because we need you, but you have no rights. You lost those when you died and became a killer.\"\n \"Is that how you think too?\" I ask Burke, trembling with rage.\n \"No,\" he says. \"To me it\u0027s abhorrent.\"\n \"Then how can you work with them?\" I snarl. \"Why do you put up with this crap? Why not walk away, like anyone halfway human would?\"\n Burke shakes his head and doesn\u0027t reply.\n \"I wouldn\u0027t be so quick to criticize your old teacher if I were you,\" Dr. Cerveris says smoothly. \"You\u0027d be back stewing with the reviveds if it weren\u0027t for Billy Burke.\"\n \"We run a background check on every revitalized,\" Josh says. \"We like to know who they are, where they came from. We gather as much information as we can before deciding how to process them.\"\n \"I bet that\u0027s so you can give priority to family members or people related to politicians or powerful businessmen,\" I sneer.\n Josh shrugs. \"I\u0027d be lying if I said that wasn\u0027t a consideration, but that\u0027s the way the world has always worked. Nepotism is rampant everywhere. But if it\u0027s any consolation, very few revitalizeds fall into that bracket, so it\u0027s rare that someone is sacrificed at the expense of a minister\u0027s son or a billionaire\u0027s daughter.\"\n \"When they ran a check on you,\" Burke says, \"they discovered your connection to me. I\u0027m a consultant, like I told you. I\u0027ve been working with the army, helping deal with undead children who are finding it hard to cope. Most are distraught at having lost family and friends. They don\u0027t all adjust as swiftly as you have.\"\n \"More\u0027s the pity,\" Dr. Cerveris murmurs. \"Our lives would be a lot simpler if every revitalized were as cold and uncaring as Becky Smith.\"\n I look at the doctor with contempt. \"Screw you, numbnuts. I care. You don\u0027t understand me at all, do you?\"\n \"That\u0027s why I\u0027ve been kept busy,\" Burke says as Dr. Cerveris scowls at me. \"I do understand, or at least I have a good idea. I never thought of it as a gift, being able to relate to teenagers, but it seems that talent is rarer than I believed. If it weren\u0027t for me and a few others, you guys would have been branded as cattle and treated the same way.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think we\u0027d have gone quite that far,\" Josh smiles frostily. \"Anyway, we realized you were one of Billy\u0027s ex-students, so we asked him if he wanted us to approve you for sustained revitalization.\"\n \"And you said yes.\" I flash my teeth at Burke in a mock smile. \"Thanks. You\u0027re my hero.\"\n \"It wasn\u0027t as simple as that,\" Burke says quietly. \"I had to pitch for you. I told them you were tough, smart, determined, that you\u0027d be an asset.\"\n \"In short,\" Josh snaps, \"he told us you\u0027d fit in perfectly with the zom heads, that if we wanted someone to carry out harsh but essential tests on reviveds, you were our girl. That\u0027s why we spared you. Otherwise...\" He puts a finger to the side of his head, twirls it round and makes loony eyes at me.\n \"Nice to know you think so highly of me,\" I snarl at Burke.\n \"Would you rather I\u0027d let you revert?\" he asks gently. \"Should I have abandoned you and left you to rot?\"\n I frown uncertainly. I can see where he\u0027s coming from, but still...\n \"You had no right to promise on my behalf,\" I mutter. \"You shouldn\u0027t have told them I\u0027d be willing to torture people - \"\n \"Zombies,\" Josh slips in.\n \" - and kill them,\" I finish.\n \"I know,\" Burke says. \"But I figured if they kept you alive, at least you\u0027d have the chance to make that decision yourself. You\u0027re faced with a choice, B. It\u0027s not a welcome choice, and I honestly don\u0027t know how I\u0027d react in your place, but it must be better than having no choice at all.\"\n \"And that choice is...?\" I challenge him.\n \"Do what they ask and stay on as a zom head,\" he says evenly. \"Or refuse to do their bidding and become a senseless zombie again.\"\n \"Not much of a choice, is it?\" I huff.\n \"No,\" he admits. \"But if you choose to defy them, at least you\u0027ll give up on consciousness willingly. The other way, you\u0027d have simply regressed without any understanding of why it was happening to you.\"\n \"So I can become a vicious mercenary or a brain-dead cannibal. That\u0027s what you\u0027re telling me?\"\n \"Boiled down to its basics, yes,\" Burke says.\n Josh coughs politely. \"I don\u0027t see any point in taking this conversation further. You know where you stand, Becky. It\u0027s time to decide. Will you help us or do we send you back to the pens?\"\n I stare at the three men, thinking hard. I\u0027d like to say it\u0027s an easy choice, but it\u0027s not. I want to do the right thing and toss their offer of cooperation back into their ugly, cynical faces. I want to stand tall and proud like a hero, face true death willingly, without any regrets.\n But at the same time I don\u0027t want to fade away and become a brainless member of the walking dead. They\u0027re going to carry out their experiments with or without me. Why not play along and cling to the semblance of life that I have? It wouldn\u0027t make any difference in the grand scheme of things.\n When we did history at school and studied the Nazis, I was always scornful of the collaborators, those who morally objected to the cruelties but went along with them anyway, guards at death camps, doctors who were asked to experiment on live subjects, tailors who made clothes for soldiers, factory workers who provided them with guns. I thought they were cowards. There was no doubt in my mind that I\u0027d have refused to help the Nazis just to save my neck.\n Now I realize it\u0027s not that simple. If it\u0027s put to you plainly, cooperate or die, it\u0027s impossible not to have doubts. Maybe a saint would shake her head and refuse to consider the possibility of collusion, but I\u0027m no saint. Hell, I\u0027m not even halfway human.\n But I\u0027ve experienced firsthand the dreadful consequences of meekly obeying people who are rotten to the core. Tyler\u0027s face flashes through my thoughts, as it does a dozen times a day, and I hear his cries again as the zombies bit into his flesh, see the pleading look in his eyes as he desperately begged me to save him. When I jumped at my dad\u0027s command and threw Tyler to the zombies, didn\u0027t I become a collaborator of sorts, as guilty as anyone who served the Nazis?\n The man I helped kill today meant nothing to me. I didn\u0027t know him, wasn\u0027t connected to him, probably had little in common with him. Maybe he was a brute who deserved to die. But even if that was the case, he had a place in this world, a stake to existence, and I took that away from him. I vowed, after throwing Tyler to the wolves, that I\u0027d never do it again. If I\u0027m to honor that vow, I\u0027ve got to treat everyone the same, not pick and choose those who count and those who don\u0027t. No collaboration, not if it costs me what little might be left of my soul.\n \"I won\u0027t do it,\" I moan, staring miserably at the table. \"You\u0027re a pack of jackals and I won\u0027t join your sick, screwed-up cause, even if you kill me.\"\n \"Oh, we won\u0027t kill you,\" Dr. Cerveris says. He leans across the table and stares at me coldly. \"We have a far more fitting punishment for obstinate hypocrites like you. Nil by mouth. This time next week, when your brain has turned to mush, you\u0027ll eat your own mother if we set her before you.\"\n \"And who knows,\" Josh purrs menacingly, in what I can only pray is nothing more than a nasty little dig, \"maybe we will....\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-underground-zom-b-2/page-14.html","bookId":2451,"book":{"id":2451,"title":"Zom-B Underground (Zom-B #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Zom-B Underground (Zom-B #2) \n Waking up in a military complex, months after zombies attacked school, B has no memory of the last few months.
