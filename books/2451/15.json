{"id":80207,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"Three days pass. I\u0027m locked inside my cell. Nobody visits, not even Reilly. No food. My stomach doesn\u0027t rumble. I don\u0027t feel hungry. But I\u0027m twitchy. I find myself obsessing about the gray gunk that I used to be fed, craving more. I get shooting pains through my head and insides. Sometimes I have to double over and grit my teeth until the pain passes. My vision is getting worse, even though I keep adding the drops. Conversely, for some strange reason my sense of smell and hearing are improving. The noises of the complex often grind away at my brain until I have to clamp my hands over my ears to block them out. Last night, when I was lying on my bed, I blacked out for a while, the way I used to when I fell asleep. The next thing I knew I was on my feet, head butting the mirror. I\u0027d smashed it to pieces but was still butting it, snarling softly. I\u0027ve tried to stay active since then, exercising, walking around my cell, doing push-ups and squats. I won\u0027t give in to fear. I won\u0027t. Let them starve me. I don\u0027t care. I\u0027m not going to play their game. I\u0027d rather die than become a killer. Really? a small part of me whispers. \"Yeah,\" I tell it. But my voice quivers and I\u0027m not entirely sure that I can believe myself, that I can stay strong and true. Working out. Keeping busy. Wanting to cling to consciousness for as long as I can, hoping that if I stay focused, it will help. I\u0027ve been thinking a lot about Mum and Dad. I\u0027d managed to put thoughts of them on hold over the last few weeks, but Josh\u0027s threat about my mum has set me wondering again. I\u0027m pretty sure they\u0027re not prisoners here - if Josh really had a card like that up his sleeve, he wouldn\u0027t have revealed it so casually - but are they squeezing out an existence in a similar complex? Were they killed? Turned into zombies? Or have they carried on as normal in a world not much different from the way it was on the day of the attacks? By what I was told, millions of people were killed in London, and hundreds of thousands were turned into zombies. But maybe Josh and the doctor were lying, feeding me misinformation to make me think the situation is worse than it really is. As I\u0027m driving myself mad thinking about the possibilities, the door suddenly slides open and Josh and Reilly stomp into my room. They both look impassive. I was doing squats but I stop and stand. Stare at the pair of them defiantly. \"I thought you might have had a change of heart,\" Josh says. The sound of his voice makes me wince, it\u0027s so loud. \"You forgot,\" I sneer, and pull up my T-shirt to expose the hole in my chest. \"I don\u0027t have a heart.\" Josh sighs. \"I\u0027m not enjoying this, Becky. I can rustle up some gruel for you in a matter of minutes if you give me the word.\" \"I can give you two words,\" I tell him. \"The second is off. Can you guess the first?\" Josh shakes his head and laughs - to my sensitive ears, it\u0027s like a jackhammer. \"I really hope you relent and come to see things our way,\" he says. \"You and I could be great friends if you cut yourself a little slack.\" \"I\u0027d cut my own throat before I\u0027d claim you as a friend,\" I grunt. Josh gasps theatrically, then nods at Reilly. \"Take her through.\" \"Where?\" I ask, tensing, thinking this is it, they\u0027re taking me back to the pens to dump me with the other zombies. \"Zom HQ,\" Reilly says, and holds up a pair of handcuffs. \"I\u0027m going to have to ask you to wear these on the way there and back.\" \"What if I don\u0027t want to?\" \"I have orders to force you if necessary,\" he says. \"I don\u0027t mean about the cuffs,\" I snort. \"Zom HQ - I don\u0027t want to go.\" \"Aren\u0027t you lonely?\" Reilly asks. He\u0027s speaking more softly than usual. I think he knows that noises hurt me. \"No,\" I lie. \"Even if I was, I\u0027d rather suffer loneliness than sit with that shower of vipers. I\u0027ve no friends there. They can all go hang.\" \"Even Mark? He wasn\u0027t involved with any of the experiments.\" I shrug. \"He wants to be.\" \"That\u0027s because he hasn\u0027t seen what they get up to.\" Reilly jangles the cuffs. \"It\u0027s not an option, B. They\u0027re determined to send you there. I don\u0027t want to hurt you, but if you leave me no choice...\" I roll my eyes and glare at the smiling Josh. \"All right. I\u0027ll come peacefully. Give me the bloody cuffs.\" The zom heads look astonished when I walk in. They also look unhappy to see me. It\u0027s a good thing I wasn\u0027t expecting a warm welcome. \"What\u0027s she doing back here?\" Tiberius shouts at Reilly as he unlocks my cuffs. \"I know you\u0027ve been missing her, so I brought her along to cheer you all up,\" Reilly deadpans, then exits. Rage squares up to me as I head towards my regular couch. \"What was all that crap about when we were experimenting on the zombies?\" he growls. \"You might call it an experiment,\" I spit. \"I call it torture and murder.\" \"You can\u0027t kill zombies,\" Rage says, looking genuinely surprised. \"Yeah, I know, they\u0027re already dead,\" I sneer. \"Why don\u0027t you change the track? I\u0027ve heard that one too many times. It\u0027s the regular excuse round here to do whatever the hell you want.\" \"But they are dead,\" Cathy protests. \"It doesn\u0027t matter what happens to them.\" \"You\u0027re dead too,\" I remind her. \"That\u0027s different,\" she growls. \"We\u0027re different.\" \"Yeah, but for how long?\" I sniff. Rage squints at me. \"What\u0027s that mean?\" I consider telling them what I\u0027ve learned, about how we regress if we don\u0027t feed, that we\u0027re kept conscious purely to serve the whims of Dr. Cerveris and his mob, who can take our minds away from us anytime they please. But I don\u0027t think they\u0027d thank me for enlightening them. Treat me to a beating, more likely, for being the bearer of bad news. \"Just leave me alone,\" I mutter, shouldering my way past Rage. \"She thinks she\u0027s better than us,\" Tiberius jeers. \"She probably wants to spread joy and peace among the zombies. Are we savages, Becky? Should we be put down like rabid dogs?\" I ignore him, grab a file and set to work on my teeth - I wasn\u0027t allowed a file in the cell, so they\u0027ve sprouted. The others toss a few insults my way but ease up when I don\u0027t bite back. I\u0027m glad when they stop talking. It\u0027s as noisy in here as it was in my cell, but I can deal with that. Their raised voices, on the other hand, strike me like punches. Mark slides over after a while and grins weakly. \"They told me what happened,\" he whispers. \"And you think I\u0027m a fool,\" I snap, laying the file aside. \"You think I should have gone along with the rest of them, hacked off limbs, burned people alive - or burned them dead, or however the hell you want to phrase it.\" Mark shrugs. \"I can\u0027t see what the fuss is, but I wasn\u0027t there. I\u0027ve never been there. I don\u0027t know what goes on, so I can\u0027t judge.\" He slumps beside me. \"To be honest, I think anything would be better than my checkups. They\u0027re operating on me more and more. They\u0027re worried about my organs, but I don\u0027t know why. I don\u0027t feel any different.\" Mark rubs his eyes and I\u0027m stunned to see his fingers come away wet. \"I thought all of our tear ducts had dried up,\" I murmur, grabbing his gloved hand and studying the moisture suspiciously. \"They\u0027ve given me new drops,\" he explains. \"A side effect is that I produce liquid that looks like tears. They say my eyes will dry up completely without the new drops, that I\u0027ll go blind.\" He sighs unhappily. \"Sorry,\" I mumble. \"That must be horrible.\" He nods. \"But they\u0027re hopeful the drops will work. And it\u0027s nice having wet eyes again. They used to sting before.\" My eyes don\u0027t really pain me, but I guess we\u0027re all different. Mark says the zom heads have been in a foul mood since they returned from the terminated experiment. \"They snap at me all the time, but at each other too. They won\u0027t admit it, but I think they\u0027re ashamed as well as angry. When you refused to harm the zombies, it made them think about how willingly they\u0027ve gone along with everything. It was just the way things were. Nobody thought they had a choice, or that there was anything wrong with what they were doing. Now they\u0027ve started to question what they\u0027ve done.\" \"And they\u0027re blaming me for that,\" I snicker. \"Nobody likes a smartarse who shakes things up. The world\u0027s a lot simpler if you don\u0027t think too much about it. I\u0027d be mad too in their shoes. I didn\u0027t want to rock the boat. I just couldn\u0027t take it. I can\u0027t see the reviveds as monsters. They\u0027re still people in my eyes.\" Mark gives my arm a squeeze. \"Don\u0027t worry,\" he says. \"They\u0027ll forgive you. Everyone\u0027s grumpy because of the diet, but once they give us back our regular rations, I\u0027m sure - \" \"What are you talking about?\" I cut in sharply. \"They stopped feeding us a couple of days ago,\" he says, surprised by my tone. \"You mean after the others came back from the experiment?\" I press. \"Yeah. They fed us the first day, same as normal, but nothing since.\" I curse loudly and everyone looks at me. I start to get to my feet, to tell them of my suspicions, then pause and sit down again. I might be wrong. Best not to say anything until I\u0027m certain. I don\u0027t want to stir them up if there\u0027s no real reason for it. So I keep my own counsel and sit out the shift, the hours dragging even slower than usual. When Reilly comes and takes us away, one by one, like he always does, I wait until he\u0027s leading me back to my cell, then grunt my question at him without looking around. \"Are the others being starved because of what I did?\" \"Yes,\" he says without hesitation. \"It was Dr. Cerveris\u0027s idea. I don\u0027t like it, but my vote doesn\u0027t carry much weight round here.\" \"My fading eyesight... my improving sense of smell and hearing... that\u0027s part of the regression?\" \"Yes,\" he says. \"Reviveds rely on their nostrils and ears more than their eyes. The others haven\u0027t been denied food quite as long as you have, so they haven\u0027t deteriorated as much as you. But they\u0027ll start to notice a significant change within the next day or two.\" \"How long can we go without food before we turn completely?\" I ask. \"It varies from one revitalized to another,\" he says evenly. \"But nobody\u0027s ever lasted more than a week.\" \"Are the doctors serious about this? It\u0027s not a bluff?\" \"Dr. Cerveris doesn\u0027t bluff,\" Reilly says with what sounds like a genuine sigh. \"He doesn\u0027t need to. There are other revitalizeds he can turn to.\" \"So if I refuse to cooperate...\" I falter, so Reilly finishes the sentence for me. \"... then they\u0027ll let Mark and all the other zom heads starve and turn back into brain-dead zombies.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-underground-zom-b-2/page-15.html","bookId":2451,"book":{"id":2451,"title":"Zom-B Underground (Zom-B #2)","description":"Storyline: Zom-B Underground (Zom-B #2) Waking up in a military complex, months after zombies attacked school, B has no memory of the last few months.
