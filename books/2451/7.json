{"id":80199,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"Reilly leads me out of the cell. I\u0027ve gotten so used to the cramped room over the last few weeks that I feel strange at first, almost afraid. The corridor outside isn\u0027t huge, but it feels like I\u0027m walking down the middle of a motorway. Four soldiers trail us, rifles at the ready. They\u0027re mean-looking sons of bitches. I think they\u0027d love an excuse to let rip. I keep my hands tight by my sides, head down, mincing along like a lamb. Reilly wanted to let me out several days ago, not long after my meeting with Dr. Cerveris and Josh. He was stunned when I asked if I could stay in the cell a while longer. After what I\u0027d seen on the TV, I needed some time by myself. I felt dirty and twisted, not fit to mix with anybody else, even zombies. I spent the last few days lying on my bed or squatting in a corner, fixating on what I\u0027d seen, the way I\u0027d feasted. It shouldn\u0027t have come as a shock - I know what I am and what zombies do - but it did. I\u0027d imagined what I thought was the worst, lots of times, but nothing could have prepared me for the cold, hard reality of that film footage. I could have tried to wipe the memory from my thoughts, turned my back on it and pretended I\u0027d never seen the macabre film. But I remember something my teacher Mr. Burke once said. \"There are lots of black-hearted, mean-spirited bastards in the world. It\u0027s important that we hold them to account. But always remember that you might be the most black-hearted and mean-spirited of the lot, so hold yourself the most accountable of all.\" After throwing Tyler to the zombies, I vowed that I\u0027d change, that I\u0027d spend the rest of my life trying to make up for what I\u0027d done. But I can\u0027t do that if I don\u0027t accept the truth about myself. I\u0027m a vicious, cannibalistic killer. I\u0027ve done plenty to be ashamed of, and I owe it to my victims to face that shame and live with it, to never forget them or what I did. After a lot of thinking, I came to terms with my guilt and... No, that\u0027s not right. I wasn\u0027t comfortable with what I\u0027d done, and I hope I never will be. But I found a place within myself to house the horror, somewhere close to the surface but not so close that it would get in the way of everything else. Once I\u0027d done that, I figured I was ready to face the world again. So when Reilly offered a second time to take me to see the revitalizeds, I agreed to tag along. We wind through a series of corridors. They all look the same, white or gray walls, fluorescent lights, lots of windows and sealed doors. I peer through some of the windows and catch glimpses of soldiers, doctors, nurses, but nothing revealing. By the control panels set in the walls next to the doors, I can tell that they\u0027re operated by scanners, one at waist height for fingerprints, the other higher up for retinas. Some of them require a security code too. Reilly finally stops at a door, opens it with a quick scan of his fingers and an eye, then gestures for me to enter. I step in, expecting a load of leather-clad, teenage zombies, but it\u0027s only a shower room, several vacant cubicles, towels and clothes laid on a bench across from them. \"What gives?\" I ask suspiciously. \"You\u0027ve been in isolation for three weeks,\" Reilly says. \"You haven\u0027t changed your clothes. I thought you might want to freshen up before you meet the others.\" \"Are you saying I smell?\" \"Yes.\" \"No peeking,\" I warn him. He laughs. \"Zombies don\u0027t do it for me. But others will be watching.\" He nods at the ceiling. \"Cameras all over this place, as I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve figured out already.\" \"Yeah. But I thought they\u0027d leave the bloody showers alone.\" Reilly shrugs and closes the door. I gaze around, trying to spot the cameras, but they\u0027re masterfully concealed. \"Sod it,\" I mutter and undress. If some creep gets a buzz from watching a one-boobed zombie in the buff, more power to him. The shower\u0027s lovely, though I have to turn it up to the max to truly appreciate it. My nerve endings don\u0027t work as well as they used to. I have to crank the heat up close to boiling before I feel warm. I scrub carefully around the hole in my chest. I pick at the green moss and try to wash it away, but it must be rooted deeply. If I pull hard, strands come out like hairs, but I\u0027m worried I might injure myself - I don\u0027t know how deeply the moss is embedded and I\u0027m afraid I might rip an even bigger hole in my chest if I persist - so I stop. I rinse down the rest of my body, smiling sadly as I rub the old c scar on my thigh. I used to hate that, since it was my only real physical blemish. Now, with a missing heart, it\u0027s the least of my worries. I massage shampoo into my scalp and try to close my eyes, forgetting that I can\u0027t. Scowling, I tilt my head back and do my best to keep the suds away from my unprotected eyeballs. Stepping out, I towel myself dry. The moss stays damp, except for the light layer on my right wrist where I was scratched shortly before Tyler clawed out my heart - that dries up nicely after a good bit of rubbing. Giving up on the moss around my chest, I slip into the new clothes. Once I\u0027m cozy, I sniff the old set and grimace. They\u0027re not as bad as I thought they\u0027d be, but I\u0027m surprised I didn\u0027t notice the odor before. Reilly should have told me. I rap on the door and it opens immediately. \"Any deodorant?\" I ask. Reilly cocks his head. \"Are you being funny?\" \"No.\" \"Didn\u0027t they tell you...?\" He smiles. \"No, I suppose it\u0027s not the sort of thing they would have thought of. Well, it\u0027s good news, B. You don\u0027t ever have to worry about your pits again. The dead don\u0027t sweat.\" \"Seriously?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Cool,\" I chuckle. Then a thought hits me and I ask with fake innocence, \"What about bad breath?\" \"There\u0027s a slight smell that will always be there,\" Reilly says. \"But it won\u0027t get any worse than that.\" \"And farts?\" I ask. Reilly laughs. \"No. You\u0027re clear on that front too.\" \"A pity,\" I sigh. \"I loved a good fart.\" My eyes narrow and I murmur sweetly, \"What about my period?\" Reilly blushes furiously. \"Without a regular flow of blood? Hardly!\" \"But are you sure?\" I press. \"Well, not a hundred percent,\" he says uneasily. \"Can you ask one of the nurses and find out for me?\" I tease him. \"Ask them yourself,\" he huffs, ears reddening at the thought of it. Typical bloke - so easy to embarrass!","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-underground-zom-b-2/page-7.html","bookId":2451,"book":{"id":2451,"title":"Zom-B Underground (Zom-B #2)","description":"Storyline: Zom-B Underground (Zom-B #2) Waking up in a military complex, months after zombies attacked school, B has no memory of the last few months.
