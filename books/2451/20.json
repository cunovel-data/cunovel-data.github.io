{"id":80212,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"We hang around like a bunch of muppets, jaws open, senses reeling, until Tiberius finally stirs. \"We\u0027ve gotta get out of here.\" \"What about Danny?\" Mark asks. \"Do you have any idea where his cell is?\" Tiberius replies. \"No.\" \"Then forget about him.\" \"Wait a moment.\" I can\u0027t believe what I\u0027m thinking as I stare at the remains of Dr. Cerveris. \"You want to tuck into his brain?\" Cathy sneers. \"Good luck - I doubt Rage left much.\" \"It\u0027s not that - although now that you mention it...\" Scraps of brain dot the interior of the dead doctor\u0027s head. Ignoring my feelings of disgust, I run my fingers around it, then suck them, drawing a small burst of strength from the meager blobs. When the rest of the zom heads see that, they push in and copy me. They all come away with flecks of brain on their fingers, though I got the lion\u0027s share of what was left. When we\u0027ve scraped Dr. Cerveris\u0027s skull completely clean, I return to it, stick a hand into the hole in the doctor\u0027s head, then feel around until I find the back of the eye that Rage didn\u0027t puncture. I push softly while cutting around the flesh at the front of the socket with my other hand. \"What\u0027s she doing?\" Cathy squeals. \"Has she gone mad?\" \"I don\u0027t think so,\" Tiberius mutters. \"The sensors... If we want to get out of here, we\u0027ll have to get through doors that require fingerprints and a retinal scan.\" Dr. Cerveris\u0027s eye oozes from its socket. I wipe the goo away, cup it gently in my palm and step back. \"I did the eye. Who\u0027s gonna cut off one of his hands?\" There\u0027s a pause. Then Gokhan bends and starts slicing. \"This is so gross,\" Cathy moans, but her lips are twitching and I can tell she\u0027s trying hard not to smile. I feel like chuckling too. It shouldn\u0027t be funny, but it is. I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll feel awful later when I look back on this, but right now I\u0027m on an unnatural high. \"Nice of him to lend us a hand,\" Tiberius deadpans, and I almost explode with laughter. I\u0027m not the only one. \"Come on,\" Mark snaps. He doesn\u0027t find this in any way entertaining. \"If we\u0027re to escape, we\u0027ll need to be quick, before they find us.\" \"Who are they, Worm?\" Peder snorts. \"The soldiers or the people who attacked.\" Mark shrugs. \"One\u0027s as bad as the other, right?\" \"What if they\u0027re here to free us?\" Cathy says. \"Maybe it\u0027s an army of zom heads come to break us out.\" I remember Mr. Dowling and the spiders. \"No,\" I sigh. \"I don\u0027t know who or what they are, but they haven\u0027t come to help us. Mark\u0027s right. We need to split ASAP, before we end up like Dr. Cerveris.\" I start off in the direction that Rage sent us, not wanting to risk a run-in with him, and after a moment of hesitation the rest of them fall in behind me. I think about the butchered Dr. Cerveris as we progress, worrying about what happened. It wasn\u0027t the fact that Rage killed him that bugs me. It\u0027s how I reacted. I was on the verge of losing control. The sight of the brain triggered something inside me, and I almost switched off and went into full-on zombie mode. I would have eaten anybody\u0027s brain right then. If I hadn\u0027t recovered my wits by chance, I\u0027d have gone after Reilly. If I\u0027d killed him and feasted, that would have been the end of me. I know that fresh brains are essential for revitalizeds, that I need to eat to hold on to my senses. But if I\u0027d given in to my baser instincts and fed in such a grisly, inhuman fashion, I think I would have regressed anyway, and gladly, all too happy to leave my conscious self behind. I\u0027m clinging onto my semi-humanity, but only just. It won\u0027t be long now. Soon I\u0027ll hit a critical point and then it\u0027s bye-bye, Becky Smith, hellooooo, zom-B!","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-underground-zom-b-2/page-20.html","bookId":2451,"book":{"id":2451,"title":"Zom-B Underground (Zom-B #2)","description":"Storyline: Zom-B Underground (Zom-B #2) Waking up in a military complex, months after zombies attacked school, B has no memory of the last few months.
