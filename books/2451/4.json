{"id":80196,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Lying on the bed, staring at the ceiling, thinking about Mum and Dad. Reilly hasn\u0027t told me anything about the outside world. We\u0027ve spent a lot of time together. He chats with me about all sorts of things, soccer, TV shows we used to watch, our lives before the zombie uprising. But he won\u0027t discuss the attack on my school or any of the other assaults that took place that day. I\u0027ve no idea if order has been restored or if the soldiers and medics here are the only people left alive in the whole wide world. I\u0027ve pushed him hard for answers, but although Reilly\u0027s been good to me, he can play deaf and dumb to perfection when he wants. I\u0027ve said a few prayers for Mum and Dad, even though I\u0027m not the praying type. For Mum especially. It\u0027s strange. I thought I loved Dad more. He was the one I respected, the one I wanted to impress. Mum was weak in my opinion, a coward and a fool for letting her husband knock her about the place. I stood up for her and always tried to help when he\u0027d lay into her, because that\u0027s what you do for your mum, but if you\u0027d ask me to name a favorite, I\u0027d have chosen Dad, despite all his flaws. But she\u0027s the one I miss most. Maybe it\u0027s because of what Dad did the day I died. He came to rescue me. Risked his own life to try to save me. But then he made me throw Tyler to the zombies, turned me into a killer, and since then... No. That\u0027s a lie, and I don\u0027t want to lie to myself anymore. I\u0027ve done too much of that in the past. Be truthful, B. Dad didn\u0027t force me. I threw Tyler to the zombies because I was scared and it was the easy thing to do. Dad hated foreigners and people who had different beliefs. I never wanted to be like him in that respect, but to keep him quiet I acted as if I was, and in the end it rubbed off on me. I became a monster. I don\u0027t ever want to allow that to happen again, but if I\u0027m to keep the beast inside me under control, I have to accept that the guilt was mine for doing what Dad told me to do. You can\u0027t blame other people for sins of your own making. I sit up, swing my legs off the bed and scowl. No use worrying about Mum and Dad until I have more information. I\u0027m sure answers will be revealed in time. They can\u0027t be keeping me alive just to hold me in this cell forever. I have to be patient. Explanations will come. If I have to mourn, I\u0027ll do it once their deaths are confirmed. Until then I need to hope for the best. To distract myself, I focus on the throbbing noise. It\u0027s constant, the rumbling of machines in the distance, AC, oxygen being pumped in for the living. It never ceases. It drove me mad for the first few days, but now I find it comforting. Without a TV, iPod, or anything else, it\u0027s the only way I have of amusing myself when Reilly\u0027s not around. I tune into the hum when I\u0027m bored and try to put images to the noises, to imagine what\u0027s happening outside this cell, soldiers marching, medics conducting their experiments, the teenagers in leather.... Hmm. I\u0027ve no idea who they were. I\u0027m pretty sure, judging by the green moss on the tall guy\u0027s cheek, that they\u0027re like me, zombies who can think and act the way they did before they died. Reilly refers to us as revitalizeds. The ordinary, mindless zombies are reviveds. But why were the revitalizeds in that room with weapons? Are they prisoners like me, or are they cooperating with the soldiers? Where did they come from? Why are they - we - different from the others? Is there hope for us? Can we be cured? I sneer at that last question. \"Of course you can\u0027t be cured, you dumb bitch,\" I snort. \"Not unless you can find the Wizard of Oz to give you a brand-new heart.\" I get up and stand in front of the mirror. I seem to be studying myself a lot recently. It\u0027s not that I\u0027m vain. There just isn\u0027t anything else to do. But I\u0027m not interested in my face this time. I was wearing the shredded, filthy remains of my school uniform when I regained consciousness. That\u0027s been replaced with a pair of jeans and a plain white T-shirt. I pull the T-shirt up to my chin and stare at my ruined chest. I never had big tits. Vinyl used to call them bee stings. I told him I\u0027d do worse than sting him if he kept on saying that, but I liked Vinyl, so I let him get away with it. My right boob is the same as it was before. But my left is missing, torn from my chest by Tyler Bayor. A fair bit of the flesh around it is missing too. And my heart\u0027s been ripped out, leaving an unnatural, grisly hole in its place. Bits of bone poke through the flesh around the hole, and I can see all sorts of tubes inside, veins, arteries and what-have-you. Congealed blood meshes the mess together, along with the green moss that sprouts lightly all over the wound. Every so often a few drops of blood ooze out of one of the tubes. But it\u0027s not like it used to be. This blood is much thicker, the consistency of jelly, and the flow always stops after a second or two. I quizzed Reilly about that. Without a heart, there shouldn\u0027t be any flow at all. The same way that, without working lungs, I shouldn\u0027t be able to speak. \"The body remembers,\" he said. \"At least it does in revitalizeds.\" \"What the hell does that mean?\" I frowned. \"When you recovered your wits, your brain started trying to control the rest of your body, the way it did when you were alive,\" he explained. \"You don\u0027t need to breathe anymore, but your brain thinks that you should, so it forces your lungs to expand and collapse, which is why you can talk. You can stop it when you focus - if you shut your mouth and close your nose, your lungs will shut down after a minute or two - but most of the time your lungs work away in the background, even though there\u0027s no reason why they should. \"If you had a heart, it would be the same. Your brain would tell it to pump blood around your body. It wouldn\u0027t operate as smoothly as it did before - no more than a weak pulse every few minutes - but it would keep the blood circulating, albeit sluggishly. \"Now, you don\u0027t have a heart,\" Reilly said unsympathetically, \"but the brain\u0027s a stubborn organ and it\u0027s doing the best it can. It\u0027s roped in some of your other organs and is using them to nudge your veins and arteries, to compensate for the missing pump. Some of the scientists here are blown away by that. They\u0027ve never seen a body do it before. They think you\u0027re the coolest thing since sliced bread. They\u0027d love to take you off to their labs to study you in depth.\" \"Who\u0027s stopping them?\" I asked, but at that the soldier clammed up again. I\u0027ve poked my finger into the cavity in my chest a few times, dipped it in the blood and smeared it across my tongue. But I can\u0027t tell if it tastes any different. My taste buds have gone to hell. My mouth is dry - my tongue feels like it\u0027s made of sandpaper - and apart from a foul staleness that is always there, I haven\u0027t been able to identify any specific tastes. I sigh as I stare at the hole. It shocked me the first few times. I couldn\u0027t believe that was really me. I turned my back on the image and tried to cry. Shook my head and refused to accept that this was what I\u0027d become. But now it doesn\u0027t bother me that much. I don\u0027t let it. Why should I? After all... \"Heh,\" I laugh humorlessly at my reflection. ... life\u0027s too short!","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-underground-zom-b-2/page-4.html","bookId":2451,"book":{"id":2451,"title":"Zom-B Underground (Zom-B #2)","description":"Storyline: Zom-B Underground (Zom-B #2) Waking up in a military complex, months after zombies attacked school, B has no memory of the last few months.
