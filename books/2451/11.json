{"id":80203,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"In zom HQ. The others are still giving me the cold shoulder because of what I did to Cathy. I\u0027ve tried apologizing but the snooty cow just ignores me. Sod her, the rest of them too. I don\u0027t care. Real loneliness is when your dad beats up your mum and you\u0027re lying in your bedroom, listening to her weep in the room next door, and it feels like the whole world\u0027s against you. A bunch of petty zombies giving me the evils? Doesn\u0027t bother me in the least. The door opens and Reilly enters, Josh Massoglia just behind him. \"You guys ready for some fun and games?\" Josh roars. \"Damn right!\" Rage bellows, rallying the others and shooing them towards the door. I haven\u0027t seen them this excited before. \"What about me?\" Mark cries. \"Can I come?\" \"Sorry,\" Josh says. \"We gave you the once-over a few days ago when we had you in for a checkup. The burns are still really bad. It\u0027s best you sit out this one.\" \"Don\u0027t worry, Worm,\" Rage chuckles. \"We\u0027ll tell you all about it when we come home.\" Mark looks crestfallen. If he could cry, he\u0027d be blinking back tears. As the others gather by the door, Josh looks over at me. \"You just gonna sit there or do you want in on this too?\" \"I\u0027m invited?\" I ask suspiciously, thinking it might be a trap. \"Of course,\" Josh says. \"Why wouldn\u0027t you be?\" He raises an eyebrow at Rage. \"That\u0027s not a problem, is it?\" Rage smiles quickly. \"Not at all. The more the merrier. Come on, B, hurry up, you don\u0027t want to make us late.\" I\u0027d like to tell the big lump to get stuffed, but I don\u0027t want to miss out on this. So I say nothing, only line up with the rest of them and follow Josh and Reilly out of zom HQ and into the heart of the complex. Cathy cuddles up close to Josh as we\u0027re walking - well, as close as he\u0027ll let her, worried as he must be that she might accidentally scratch him and condemn him to living death. She makes cow eyes at him and actually asks if he\u0027s been working out. Give me strength! Josh laughs it off and pretends he doesn\u0027t know that she\u0027s got a crush on him. We come to a door that requires a security code as well as the usual finger and retinal scans. Reilly opens it and we step into a room packed with weapons of all description. They\u0027re locked away in padlocked, thick steel cages, and I don\u0027t see any keys on either of the soldiers. Doesn\u0027t look like they want to take the chance of us going wild and getting our hands on a full arsenal. Some of the weapons have been laid on a table in the middle of the room. \"Take your pick,\" Josh says grandly. \"Girls first.\" I approach with Cathy and cast an eye over the loot. Flamethrowers, stun guns, spears, large knives, axes and small chainsaws. Two of each. \"Wow!\" Cathy exclaims, rushing to grab a chainsaw. \"These are new. They\u0027re awesome.\" \"Have you used a chainsaw before?\" Josh asks. \"No.\" \"You\u0027d better be careful. They\u0027re nasty if you swing them the wrong way. Maybe you should leave that to the boys.\" \"I\u0027ll be fine,\" Cathy smirks, pulling a cord to turn it on. She scythes through the air with the buzzing saw a couple of times, then turns it off and hangs it by her side. I hate to admit it, but she looks cool as hell. \"Becky?\" Josh asks. \"I don\u0027t know.\" I study the weapons glumly. I\u0027ve never used anything like this before. I\u0027m worried that I\u0027ll pick something I can\u0027t use and end up looking like a mug. Maybe I should have stayed in zom HQ with Mark. \"We normally insist on pairs,\" Reilly explains. \"Now that Cathy\u0027s chosen a chainsaw, somebody else has to choose one too. Usually, if you picked a flamethrower and Rage stepped up next and chose a knife, the final three would have to make their choice from those weapons, one each.\" \"But now there\u0027s seven of you,\" Josh says. \"So there will have to be an odd one out. Tell you what, since this is your first time, you can have dibs on the exclusive weapon. So unless you fancy a chainsaw, pick from any of the others and we\u0027ll remove that choice for the rest.\" I walk around the table, studying the weapons. I run a hand over a flamethrower and remember my introduction to life in this brave new world. I see Rage\u0027s eyes narrow - he wants a flamethrower - and I nearly pick it just to spite him. But I don\u0027t like fire. \"I\u0027ll take a spear,\" I decide, keeping it simple. The others make their choices. When we\u0027re ready, we carry our weapons through to another room, where leather suits and helmets are hanging up for us. The trousers feel strange as I tug them on. I was never much into leather. I owned a couple of jackets in my time but no pants or shirts. The clothes feel tight on me, uncomfortable even with my less sensitive skin. \"Are these really necessary?\" I grumble. \"They\u0027ll help protect you,\" Josh says. \"You saw the way Rage was bitten. Leather can be penetrated, but not as easily as regular clothing. You\u0027ll be glad of it if a revived sinks their teeth into one of your legs or arms.\" \"But they can\u0027t infect us now, can they?\" I frown. \"We\u0027re zombies already.\" \"They can still hurt us, you idiot,\" Cathy snaps. \"A bite or a scratch stings like a bitch,\" Tiberius tells me. \"And though moss will grow around it, you\u0027ll carry the wound for the rest of your life.\" \"Fair enough.\" I start to pull my T-shirt off, then pause. I don\u0027t have anything on underneath. I was never shy about my body, but I didn\u0027t go about flashing my tits to one and all. I glance around the room. The others are taking off their clothes and pulling on the leathers without any worries. The boys don\u0027t cover themselves, and Cathy doesn\u0027t either. They don\u0027t gape at one another or make suggestive comments, just get on with things, as if they\u0027re too grown-up to worry about a little nudity. I shrug and pull off my T-shirt. \"Bloody hell!\" Tiberius gasps and everybody looks up. At first I think he\u0027s staring at my boob and I prepare a hot retort. Then I realize it\u0027s the hole in my chest that caught his attention. \"That\u0027s incredible.\" \"Not as incredible as your ginger hair,\" I mutter, but I feel oddly proud. The others can boast a cool variety of scars and bite marks, but nothing as outlandish as this. Cathy comes closer and stares deep into the gaping hole. \"That must have hurt like hell,\" she whispers. \"I can\u0027t remember,\" I lie, suppressing a shiver as I recall what it felt like when Tyler ripped my beating heart from between the shattered bones of my chest. Cathy reaches out to put her hand in the hole, then pauses. \"Do you mind?\" \"Of course I bloody mind,\" I snort. \"That\u0027d be like me asking if I could stick my hand up your arse.\" Everyone laughs and I tug on a leather shirt. \"It\u0027s an impressive wound,\" Cathy says grudgingly, then winks at me. \"But the breast wasn\u0027t so hot.\" \"Get stuffed,\" I grunt, but we share a grin and I think she\u0027s finally forgiven me for cutting off her hair. \"Right,\" Josh says when we\u0027re ready, weapons in one hand, helmets in the other. \"Most of you know the drill but I\u0027ll go through it again for Becky\u0027s sake. We\u0027re going to put you in with a group of reviveds. There\u0027s a speaker system inside each helmet. We\u0027ll be issuing orders as you go.\" \"Let\u0027s hope nobody breaks rank this time,\" Reilly huffs, looking pointedly at Rage. \"I\u0027ve said sorry for that already,\" Rage groans. \"I lost my head. It won\u0027t happen again. Promise.\" \"To start with, stand still,\" Josh goes on. \"Let them mill around you. If they attack, defend yourself, but don\u0027t stir them up until we tell you. And when you do, follow orders as closely as you can, as long as you can, until things get chaotic. When we think the situation\u0027s getting out of hand, we\u0027ll drop the nets and bring proceedings to a close. Any questions?\" \"What\u0027s the point of it all?\" I ask. \"We\u0027re testing the reviveds,\" Josh says. \"Their reactions, what they respond to, what they ignore, how much they remember on an instinctive level from their old lives. We\u0027ll also be checking if they show signs of revitalizing, but that\u0027s not the main goal of the experiment, since it happens so rarely.\" \"How far can we go?\" I press. \"Do we draw the line at dismembering them, killing them, what?\" \"You can\u0027t kill them,\" Josh laughs. \"They\u0027re already dead.\" \"You know what I mean. If we destroy their brains, we\u0027ll finish them off. That\u0027s killing in my book.\" \"Well it shouldn\u0027t be,\" Josh snaps, losing his smile. \"Don\u0027t think of these as people. Not even animals. They\u0027re walking corpses, monsters who would rip apart everything we know and cherish. They slaughtered friends of yours, maybe family members too, and one of them even killed you. There should be no room in your heart for sympathy, not where these beasts are concerned.\" \"Tear them to pieces,\" Danny snarls. \"They\u0027d do even worse to you if they had the chance.\" \"Well said.\" Josh is beaming again. \"Now, if you\u0027re all ready and willing, let\u0027s do some business.\" Everyone cheers and roars like gladiators. Reilly opens a door - not the one we entered by - and we pass along a short corridor, just us seven zom heads, leaving the soldiers behind. We enter a bare room like the one I found myself in the first time I recovered my senses. White walls, lots of windows, soldiers and scientists crowded behind them. Rage clomps to the middle of the room and the rest of us follow. We form a tight circle. I\u0027m nervous and I can tell that the others are too. They\u0027ve been looking forward to this - it breaks the monotony - but in the quiet moments before it kicks off, they tense and wonder what will happen if it goes wrong. Each of us tests our weapon, flexes our muscles, prepares for battle. I start to wish I\u0027d chosen something more substantial than a spear. I don\u0027t feel as protected as the others. I wish I could swap it for a chainsaw. Then three doors click open at the same time, in three different walls. There\u0027s a short pause, flickering shadows, the smell of blood in the air. Then about thirty zombies slip into the room, spread out, shake their heads and fix their snarling, ravenous sights on us.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-underground-zom-b-2/page-11.html","bookId":2451,"book":{"id":2451,"title":"Zom-B Underground (Zom-B #2)","description":"Storyline: Zom-B Underground (Zom-B #2) Waking up in a military complex, months after zombies attacked school, B has no memory of the last few months.
