{"id":1930,"title":"Rock Bottom (Tristan \u0026 Danika #2)","description":"Storyline: Rock Bottom (Tristan \u0026 Danika #2) Their love had the power of a runaway freight train, and the potential to be just as destructive. The tempestuous sequel to Bad Things picks up where the first book left off. Reeling from a profound loss, Tristan and Danika struggle to pick up the pieces and build a life together, but the hard habits of a lifetime are not so easy to escape. Rock Bottom takes us on a dual point of view journey through addiction and desire, through love and agony, and answers the question we’ve been asking since these characters were introduced in Grounded: “What happened between Tristan and Danika?” DANIKA Even love couldn’t cushion a fall like ours. My love for Tristan was so big that I felt consumed by it, and even so, it was not enough to overpower our combined demons. I struggled. I yelled and screamed. I scratched and kicked. I fought like hell, but even the most determined fighters have to stop before they break. No one could say I didn’t fight for him. “I love you,” I spoke softly into his ear. He gripped me harder. “I can’t ever lose you, Danika. I’m not sure I’d survive it.” “You’ve got me. And I’m not going anywhere. Not ever.” I meant the words when I said them, but life had other plans for us. I’d have given my life for that fight. In fact, I very nearly did. TRISTAN She was the one. If I’d ever had a doubt, I didn’t now. She was the one I’d be thinking about, longing for, until I took my last breath. If I lost her tomorrow, I’d pine for her like a lovesick fool. This was the kind of love that only hit you once in your life.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/rock-bottom-tristan-danika-2.jpg","author":"R.K.
