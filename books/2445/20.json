In that terrible, impossibly long moment of his fall, I imagined half a dozen fantastic scenarios, where Mika or Arrow or Mr Tall intervened to divert the course of fate, and we all walked away smiling. But it wasn\u0027t to be. There was no last-minute cavalry charge. No miraculous rescue. Vancha hadn\u0027t flitted to Vampire Mountain. We were alone, as we had to be, as destiny willed it. Mr Crepsley dropped. He was impaled on the stakes. He died. And it wasawful . I can\u0027t even say that it was quick and merciful, as it was for the Lord of the Vampaneze, because he didn\u0027t die straightaway. The stakes didn\u0027t kill him instantly, and though his soul didn\u0027t linger long, his cries while he writhed there, bleeding and dying, burning and screaming, will stay with me till I die. Maybe I\u0027ll even carry them with me when I go. Debbie wept bitterly. Vancha howled like a wolf. Green tears trickled from Harkat\u0027s round green eyes. Even the Chief Inspector turned away from the scene and sniffed miserably. Not me. I couldn\u0027t. My eyes stayed dry. Stumbling forward, I stopped at the edge of the pit and stared down at the stakes and the two bodies being quickly stripped bare of their flesh by the flames. I stood as though on guard, not budging or looking away, paying no attention as the vampaneze and vampets filed silently out of the cavern. They could have executed us, but their leader was dead, their dreams had been dashed, and they were no longer interested in battle - not even in revenge. I was barely aware of Vancha, Debbie, Harkat and Alice Burgess as they came to stand by my side. \"We should go now,\" Vancha muttered after a while. \"No,\" I replied dully. \"I\u0027m taking him with us, to bury him properly.\" \"It\u0027ll be hours before the fire dies out,\" Vancha said. \"I\u0027m in no rush. The hunt\u0027s over. We\u0027ve all the time in the world.\" Vancha sighed deeply, then nodded. \"Very well. We\u0027ll wait. \"Not me,\" Debbie sobbed. \"I can\u0027t. It\u0027s too horrible. I can\u0027t stay and ?\" She broke down in tears. I wanted to comfort her, but couldn\u0027t. There was nothing I could think to say to make her feel better. \"I\u0027ll look after her,\" Burgess said, taking charge. \"We\u0027ll walk up the tunnel and wait for you in the smaller cavern.\" \"Thanks, Alice,\" Vancha said. Burgess paused before leaving. \"I\u0027m still not sure about you guys,\" she said, \"if you\u0027re really vampires or not. And I haven\u0027t a clue what I\u0027m going to tell my people about this. But I know evil when I see it, and I like to think I know good too. I won\u0027t stand in your way when it\u0027s time for you to leave. And if you need any help, you only have to call.\" \"Thanks,\" Vancha said again, and this time he managed a thin, grateful smile. The women left, Debbie crying, Burgess supporting her. They pushed through the departing ranks of vampaneze and vampets, who gave way meekly to the pair who\u0027d helped bring about the downfall of their Lord. Minutes passed. The flames flickered on. Mr Crepsley and the Lord of the Vampaneze burned. Then a strange-looking pair hobbled up to confront us. One had no hands, although he carried a pair of hook-hands slung around his neck. The other had only half a face and was moaning piteously. R.V. and Morgan James. \"We\u0027ll get you swine!\" R.V. snarled, pointing threateningly with his left stump. \"Gannen gave his word that he\u0027d let you go, so we can\u0027t harm you now, but we\u0027ll hunt you down later and make you sorry you were born.\" \"You\u0027d better come well prepared, Hooky,\" Vancha commented dryly. \"You\u0027ll find us a realhandful !\u0027 R.V. hissed at the joke and made to attack the Prince. Morgan held him back, mumbling through teeth - half of which had been shattered by Burgess\u0027 bullet - \"Curhm awahy! Thuy ahn\u0027t wurth iht!\" \"Hah,\" Vancha chuckled spitefully. \"That\u0027s easy for you to say!\" This time R.V. had to push Morgan James back as he struggled to get his hands on Vancha. Cursing and fighting with each other, they backed off, joined the ranks of their numbed colleagues, and drifted away to patch themselves up and plot mean-spirited revenge. Again we were alone at the pit. The cavern was quieter now. Almost all the vampaneze and vampets had exited. Only a last few stragglers remained. Among them were Gannen Harst and a grinning Steve Leopard, who couldn\u0027t resist ambling over for one last mocking laugh. \"What\u0027s that cooking on the fire, boys?\" he asked, putting up his hands as if to warm them. \"Go away,\" I said blankly, \"or I\u0027ll kill you.\" Steve\u0027s face dropped and he glared at me. \"It\u0027s your own fault,\" he pouted. \"If you hadn\u0027t betrayed me?\" I swung my sword up, meaning to cut him in two. Vancha swatted it aside with the flat of his hand before I drew blood. \"No,\" he said, stepping between us. \"If you kill him, the others will return and kill us. Let it drop. We\u0027ll get him later.\" \"Wise words, brother,\" Gannen Harst said, stepping up beside Vancha. His face was drawn. \"There\u0027s been enough killing. We?\" \"Get lost!\" Vancha snapped. Harst\u0027s expression darkened. \"Don\u0027t speak to me like?\" \"I won\u0027t warn you again,\" Vancha growled. The ex-protector of the Vampaneze Lord bristled angrily, then raised his hands peacefully and backed away from his brother. Steve didn\u0027t follow. \"I want to tell him,\" the half-vampaneze said, eyes pinned on me. \"No!\" Gannen Harst hissed. \"You mustn\u0027t! Not now! You?\" \"Iwant totell him,\" Steve said again, more forcefully this time. Harst cursed beneath his breath, glanced from one of us to the other, then nodded tensely. \"Very well. But over to one side, where nobody else can hear.\" \"What are you up to now?\" Vancha asked suspiciously. \"You\u0027ll find out,\" Steve giggled, taking hold of my left elbow. I shrugged him off. \"Keep away from me, monster!\" I spat. \"Now, now,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t be hasty. I\u0027ve news I\u0027m bursting to tell you.\" \"I don\u0027t want to hear it.\" \"Oh, but you do,\" he insisted. \"You\u0027ll kick yourself from here to the moon if you don\u0027t come and listen.\" I wanted to tell him what he could do with his news, but there was something in his wicked eyes which made me pause. I hesitated a moment, then stomped away out of earshot of the others. Steve followed me, Gannen Harst hot on his heels. \"If you hurt him ?\" Vancha warned them. \"We won\u0027t,\" Harst promised, then stopped and shielded us with his body from the view of the rest. \"Well?\" I asked, as Steve stood smirking at me. \"We\u0027ve come a long way, haven\u0027t we, Darren?\" he remarked. \"From the classroom at home to this Cavern of Retribution. From humanity to vampirism and vampanizm. From the day to the night.\" \"Tell me something I don\u0027t know,\" I grunted. \"I used to think it could have been different,\" he said softly, eyes distant. \"But now I think it was always meant to be this way. It was your destiny to betray me and form an alliance with the vampires, your fate to become a Vampire Prince and lead the hunt for the Vampaneze Lord. Just as it was my destiny to find my own path into the night and ?\" He stopped and a sly expression crept over his face. \"Hold him,\" he grunted, and Gannen Harst grabbed my arms and held me rooted to the spot. \"Are you ready to send him sleepy-byes?\" \"Yes,\" Harst said. \"But hurry, before the others intervene.\" \"Your wish is my command,\" Steve smiled, then put his lips close to my right ear and whispered something terrible - something dreadful - something that turned my world on its head and would haunt my every waking and sleeping moment from that instant on. As he drew away, having tormented me with his devastating secret, I opened my mouth wide to shout the news to Vancha. Before I could utter a syllable, Gannen Harst breathed over me, the knockout gas of the vampires and vampaneze. As the fumes filled my lungs, the world around me faded, and then I was falling, unconscious, into the tortured sleep of the damned. The last thing I heard before I blacked out was Steve, laughing hysterically - the sound of a victorious demon cackling.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/killers-of-the-dawn-the-saga-of-darren-shan-9/page-20.html","bookId":2445,"book":{"id":2445,"title":"Killers of the Dawn (The Saga of Darren Shan #9)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #9: Killers of the Dawn Killers of the Dawn is the ninth book in The Saga of Darren Shan by Darren Shan.
