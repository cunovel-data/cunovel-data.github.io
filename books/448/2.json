Instantly Uncle Andrew\u0027s hand was over his mouth. \"None of that!\" he hissed in Digory\u0027s ear. \"If you start making a noise your Mother\u0027ll hear it. And you know what a fright might do to her.\"\\n\\n As Digory said afterwards, the horrible meanness of getting at a chap in that way, almost made him sick. But of course he didn\u0027t scream again.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s better,\" said Uncle Andrew. \"Perhaps you couldn\u0027t help it. It is a shock when you first see someone vanish. Why, it gave even me a turn when the guinea-pig did it the other night.\"\\n\\n \"Was that when you yelled?\" asked Digory.\\n\\n \"Oh, you heard that, did you? I hope you haven\u0027t been spying on me?\"\\n\\n \"No, I haven\u0027t,\" said Digory indignantly. \"But what\u0027s happened to Polly?\"\\n\\n \"Congratulate me, my dear boy,\" said Uncle Andrew, rubbing his hands. \"My experiment has succeeded. The little girl\u0027s gone - vanished - right out of the world.\"\\n\\n \"What have you done to her?\"\\n\\n \"Sent her to - well - to another place.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\" asked Digory.\\n\\n Uncle Andrew sat down and said, \"Well, I\u0027ll tell you all about it. Have you ever heard of old Mrs Lefay?\"\\n\\n \"Wasn\u0027t she a great-aunt or something?\" said Digory.\\n\\n \"Not exactly,\" said Uncle Andrew. \"She was my godmother. That\u0027s her, there, on the wall.\"\\n\\n Digory looked and saw a faded photograph: it showed the face of an old woman in a bonnet. And he could now remember that he had once seen a photo of the same face in an old drawer, at home, in the country. He had asked his Mother who it was and Mother had not seemed to want to talk about the subject much. It was not at all a nice face, Digory thought, though of course with those early photographs one could never really tell.\\n\\n \"Was there - wasn\u0027t there - something wrong about her, Uncle Andrew?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Well,\" said Uncle Andrew with a chuckle, \"it depends what you call wrong. People are so narrow-minded. She certainly got very queer in later life. Did very unwise things. That was why they shut her up.\"\\n\\n \"In an asylum, do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"Oh no, no, no,\" said Uncle Andrew in a shocked voice. \"Nothing of that sort. Only in prison.\"\\n\\n \"I say!\" said Digory. \"What had she done?\"\\n\\n \"Ah, poor woman,\" said Uncle Andrew. \"She had been very unwise. There were a good many different things. We needn\u0027t go into all that. She was always very kind to me.\"\\n\\n \"But look here, what has all this got to do with Polly? I do wish you\u0027d -\"\\n\\n \"All in good time, my boy,\" said Uncle Andrew. \"They let old Mrs Lefay out before she died and I was one of the very few people whom she would allow to see her in her last illness. She had got to dislike ordinary, ignorant people, you understand. I do myself. But she and I were interested in the same sort of things. It was only a few days before her death that she told me to go to an old bureau in her house and open a secret drawer and bring her a little box that I would find there. The moment I picked up that box I could tell by the pricking in my fingers that I held some great secret in my hands. She gave it me and made me promise that as soon as she was dead I would burn it, unopened, with certain ceremonies. That promise I did not keep.\"\\n\\n \"Well, then, it was jolly rotten of you,\" said Digory.\\n\\n \"Rotten?\" said Uncle Andrew with a puzzled look.\\n\\n \"Oh, I see. You mean that little boys ought to keep their promises. Very true: most right and proper, I\u0027m sure, and I\u0027m very glad you have been taught to do it. But of course you must understand that rules of that sort, however excellent they may be for little boys - and servants - and women - and even people in general, can\u0027t possibly be expected to apply to profound students and great thinkers and sages. No, Digory. Men like me, who possess hidden wisdom, are freed from common rules just as we are cut off from common pleasures. Ours, my boy, is a high and lonely destiny.\"\\n\\n As he said this he sighed and looked so grave and noble and mysterious that for a second Digory really thought he was saying something rather fine. But then he remembered the ugly look he had seen on his Uncle\u0027s face the moment before Polly had vanished: and all at once he saw through Uncle Andrew\u0027s grand words. \"All it means,\" he said to himself, \"Is that he thinks he can do anything he likes to get anything he wants.\"\\n\\n \"Of course,\" said Uncle Andrew, \"I didn\u0027t dare to open the box for a long time, for I knew it might contain something highly dangerous. For my godmother was a very remarkable woman. The truth is, she was one of the last mortals in this country who had fairy blood in her. (She said there had been two others in her time. One was a duchess and the other was a charwoman.) In fact, Digory, you are now talking to the last man (possibly) who really had a fairy godmother. There! That\u0027ll be something for you to remember when you are an old man yourself.\"\\n\\n \"I bet she was a bad fairy,\" thought Digory; and added out loud. \"But what about Polly?\"\\n\\n \"How you do harp on that!\" said Uncle Andrew. \"As if that was what mattered! My first task was of course to study the box itself. It was very ancient. And I knew enough even then to know that it wasn\u0027t Greek, or Old Egyptian, or Babylonian, or Hittite, or Chinese. It was older than any of those nations. Ah - that was a great day when I at last found out the truth. The box was Atlantean; it came from the lost island of Atlantis. That meant it was centuries older than any of the stone-age things they dig up in Europe. And it wasn\u0027t a rough, crude thing like them either. For in the very dawn of time Atlantis was already a great city with palaces and temples and learned men.\"\\n\\n He paused for a moment as if he expected Digory to say something. But Digory was disliking his Uncle more every minute, so he said nothing.\\n\\n \"Meanwhile,\" continued Uncle Andrew, \"I was learning a good deal in other ways (it wouldn\u0027t be proper to explain them to a child) about Magic in general. That meant that I came to have a fair idea what sort of things might be in the box. By various tests I narrowed down the possibilities. I had to get to know some - well, some devilish queer people, and go through some very disagreeable experiences. That was what turned my head grey. One doesn\u0027t become a magician for nothing. My health broke down in the end. But I got better. And at last I actually knew.\"\\n\\n Although there was not really the least chance of anyone overhearing them, he leaned forward and almost whispered as he said:\\n\\n \"The Atlantean box contained something that had been brought from another world when our world was only just beginning.\"\\n\\n \"What?\" asked Digory, who was now interested in spite of himself.\\n\\n \"Only dust,\" said Uncle Andrew. \"Fine, dry dust. Nothing much to look at. Not much to show for a lifetime of toil, you might say. Ah, but when I looked at that dust (I took jolly good care not to touch it) and thought that every grain had once been in another world - I don\u0027t mean another planet, you know; they\u0027re part of our world and you could get to them if you went far enough - but a really Other World - another Nature another universe - somewhere you would never reach even if you travelled through the space of this universe for ever and ever - a world that could be reached only by Magic - well!\" Here Uncle Andrew rubbed his hands till his knuckles cracked like fireworks.\\n\\n \"I knew,\" he went on, \"that if only you could get it into the right form, that dust would draw you back to the place it had come from. But the difficulty was to get it into the right form. My earlier experiments were all failures. I tried them on guinea-pigs. Some of them only died. Some exploded like little bombs -\"\\n\\n \"It was a jolly cruel thing to do,\" said Digory who had once had a guinea-pig of his own.\\n\\n \"How you do keep getting off the point!\" said Uncle Andrew. \"That\u0027s what the creatures were for. I\u0027d bought them myself. Let me see - where was I? Ah yes. At last I succeeded in making the rings: the yellow rings. But now a new difficulty arose. I was pretty sure, now, that a yellow ring would send any creature that touched it into the Other Pace. But what would be the good of that if I couldn\u0027t get them back to tell me what they had found there?\"\\n\\n \"And what about them?\" said Digory. \"A nice mess they\u0027d be in if they couldn\u0027t get back!\"\\n\\n \"You will keep on looking at everything from the wrong point of view,\" said Uncle Andrew with a look of impatience. \"Can\u0027t you understand that the thing is a great experiment? The whole point of sending anyone into the Other Place is that I want to find out what it\u0027s like.\"\\n\\n \"Well why didn\u0027t you go yourself then?\"\\n\\n Digory had hardly ever seen anyone so surprised and offended as his Uncle did at this simple question. \"Me? Me?\" he exclaimed. \"The boy must be mad! A man at my time of life, and in my state of health, to risk the shock and the dangers of being flung suddenly into a different universe? I never heard anything so preposterous in my life! Do you realize what you\u0027re saying? Think what Another World means - you might meet anything anything.\"\\n\\n \"And I suppose you\u0027ve sent Polly into it then,\" said Digory. His cheeks were flaming with anger now. \"And all I can say,\" he added, \"even if you are my Uncle - is that you\u0027ve behaved like a coward, sending a girl to a place you\u0027re afraid to go to yourself.\"\\n\\n \"Silence, sir!\" said Uncle Andrew, bringing his hand down on the table. \"I will not be talked to like that by a little, dirty, schoolboy. You don\u0027t understand. I am the great scholar, the magician, the adept, who is doing the experiment. Of course I need subjects to do it on. Bless my soul, you\u0027ll be telling me next that I ought to have asked the guinea-pigs\u0027 permission before I used them! No great wisdom can be reached without sacrifice. But the idea of my going myself is ridiculous. It\u0027s like asking a general to fight as a common soldier. Supposing I got killed, what would become of my life\u0027s work?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, do stop jawing,\" said Digory. \"Are you going to bring Polly back?\"\\n\\n \"I was going to tell you, when you so rudely interrupted me,\" said Uncle Andrew, \"that I did at last find out a way of doing the return journey. The green rings draw you back.\"\\n\\n \"But Polly hasn\u0027t got a green ring.\"\\n\\n \"No \" said Uncle Andrew with a\\n\\n cruel smile.\\n\\n \"Then she can\u0027t get back,\" shouted Digory. \"And it\u0027s exactly the same as if you\u0027d murdered her.\\n\\n \"She can get back,\" said Uncle Andrew, \"if someone else will go after her, wearing a yellow ring himself and taking two green rings, one to bring himself back and one to bring her back.\"\\n\\n And now of course Digory saw the trap in which he was caught: and he stared at Uncle Andrew, saying nothing, with his mouth wide open. His cheeks had gone very pale.\\n\\n \"I hope,\" said Uncle Andrew presently in a very high and mighty voice, just as if he were a perfect Uncle who had given one a handsome tip and some good advice, \"I hope, Digory, you are not given to showing the white feather. I should be very sorry to think that anyone of our family had not enough honour and chivalry to go to the aid of - er - a lady in distress.\"\\n\\n \"Oh shut up!\" said Digory. \"If you had any honour and all that, you\u0027d be going yourself. But I know you won\u0027t. Alright. I see I\u0027ve got to go. But you are a beast. I suppose you planned the whole thing, so that she\u0027d go without knowing it and then I\u0027d have to go after her.\"\\n\\n \"Of course,\" said Uncle Andrew with his hateful smile.\\n\\n \"Very well. I\u0027ll go. But there\u0027s one thing I jolly well mean to say first. I didn\u0027t believe in Magic till today. I see now it\u0027s real. Well if it is, I suppose all the old fairy tales are more or less true. And you\u0027re simply a wicked, cruel magician like the ones in the stories. Well, I\u0027ve never read a story in which people of that sort weren\u0027t paid out in the end, and I bet you will be. And serve you right.\"\\n\\n Of all the things Digory had said this was the first that really went home. Uncle Andrew started and there came over his face a look of such horror that, beast though he was, you could almost feel sorry for him. But a second later he smoothed it all away and said with a rather forced laugh, \"Well, well, I suppose that is a natural thing for a child to think - brought up among women, as you have been. Old wives\u0027 tales, eh? I don\u0027t think you need worry about my danger, Digory. Wouldn\u0027t it be better to worry about the danger of your little friend? She\u0027s been gone some time. If there are any dangers Over There - well, it would be a pity to arrive a moment too late.\"\\n\\n \"A lot you care,\" said Digory fiercely. \"But I\u0027m sick of this jaw. What have I got to do?\"\\n\\n \"You really must learn to control that temper of yours, my boy,\" said Uncle Andrew coolly. \"Otherwise you\u0027ll grow up like your Aunt Letty. Now. Attend to me.\"\\n\\n He got up, put on a pair of gloves, and walked over to the tray that contained the rings.\\n\\n \"They only work,\" he said, \"if they\u0027re actually touching your skin. Wearing gloves, I can pick them up - like this - and nothing happens. If you carried one in your pocket nothing would happen: but of course you\u0027d have to be careful not to put your hand in your pocket and touch it by accident. The moment you touch a yellow ring, you vanish out of this world. When you are in the Other Place I expect - of course this hasn\u0027t been tested yet, but I expect - that the moment you touch a green ring you vanish out of that world and - I expect - reappear in this. Now. I take these two greens and drop them into your right-hand pocket. Remember very carefully which pocket the greens are in. G for green and R for right. G.R. you see: which are the first two letters of green. One for you and one for the little girl. And now you pick up a yellow one for yourself. I should put it on on your finger - if I were you. There\u0027ll be less chance of dropping it.\"\\n\\n Digory had almost picked up the yellow ring when he suddenly checked himself.\\n\\n \"Look here,\" he said. \"What about Mother? Supposing she asks where I am?\"\\n\\n \"The sooner you go, the sooner you\u0027ll be back,\" said Uncle Andrew cheerfully.\\n\\n \"But you don\u0027t really know whether I can get back.\"\\n\\n Uncle Andrew shrugged his shoulders, walked across to the door, unlocked it, threw it open, and said:\\n\\n \"Oh very\u0027 well then. Just as you please. Go down and have your dinner. Leave the little girl to be eaten by wild animals or drowned or starved in Otherworld or lost there for good, if that\u0027s what you prefer. It\u0027s all one to me. Perhaps before tea time you\u0027d better drop in on Mrs Plummer and explain that she\u0027ll never see her daughter again; because you were afraid to put on a ring.\"\\n\\n \"By gum,\" said Digory, \"don\u0027t I just wish I was big enough to punch your head!\"\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/118/229.html","bookId":448,"book":{"id":448,"title":"纳尼亚传奇：魔法师的外甥 The Magician‘s Nephew","description":"简介： First editionMain article: The Magician\u0027s NephewCompleted in February 1954[10] and published by Bodley Head in London on 2 May 1955, the prequel The Magician\u0027s Nephew brings the reader back to the very beginning of Narnia where we learn how Asla...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290997589ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/118","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:43 AM"}}
