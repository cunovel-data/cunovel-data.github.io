Toasts came fast and furious and then—Ai, God!—it was time.\\n\\n Servingwomen cleared off their table, he hoisted Tallia up and climbed on after, and eight young lords actually carried the table with the pair of them on it to the guesthouse set aside for their bridal night; crude, certainly, and boisterous as every person there laughed and called out suggestions, but Alain didn’t mind the old tradition if only because Tallia had to hold on to him to keep from sliding off. She looked terrified, and actually shrank against him when he put an arm around her to pull her firmly to his side. She was as delicate as a sparrow.\\n\\n “Here, now,” he whispered. “I’ll hold you safe.” She trustingly pressed her face against his shoulder.\\n\\n The crowd roared approvingly.\\n\\n Ai, Lady, Perhaps it was he who would faint. He was deliriously happy.\\n\\n They let the table down unsteadily by the threshold, and he helped Tallia down. She still clung to him, more afraid of the crowd than of him.\\n\\n “Who witnesses?” cried out someone in the crowd.\\n\\n A hundred voices answered.\\n\\n The king himself came forward to speak the traditional words. “Your consent having been obtained, let this marriage be fittingly consummated so that it can be legal and binding. Let there be an exchange of morning gifts at this door after dawn to signify that consummation.” He laughed, in a fine good humor after enough wine to soak a pig, a good meal, and the company of thrilling entertainers and all his good companions. “May you have God’s blessing this night,” he added, and as a mark of his extreme favor offered Alain his hand to kiss. Alain bent to one knee, took the king’s callused hand, and kissed the knuckles. Tallia, sinking to both knees beside him, pressed her uncle’s hand to her lips with a faint sigh. The lantern light made their shadows huge along the wall, like elongated giants.\\n\\n Lavastine stepped forward to open the door for them, an unexpected gesture more like that of servant than lord and father. Alain caught his hands as well and pressed them to his lips. Everything seemed so much larger and fuller this night: the noise of the crowd, the brush of wind on his face, his love for his father which suddenly seemed to swell until it encompassed the heavens, the joyous barking of the hounds, who had not been allowed to escort them for fear that they would frighten Tallia and become too unruly among such a large and boisterous crowd.\\n\\n Lavastine took him under the elbow and raised him up. This close, Alain saw a single tear snaking a path down the count’s face. Lavastine paused, then took Alain’s head gently between his hands and kissed him on the forehead.\\n\\n “I beg you, Daughter,” he said, turning to Tallia. “Make him happy.”\\n\\n Tallia seemed ready to swoon. Alain put an arm around her to support her and, with cheers and lewd suggestions ringing out behind them, helped her in over the threshold.\\n\\n Servants waited within. A good broad bed stood with its head against one wall of the simple chamber, made comfortable with a feather bed and quilt and a huge bedspread embroidered with the roes of Varre and the black hounds of Lavas. Obviously the bedspread had been in the making for some months. At the other wall stood a table and two handsome chairs. On the table sat a finely-glazed pitcher and a basin, for washing hands and face, and next to them a wooden bowl carved with turtledoves that held ripe berries, and also two gilded cups filled with a heady-scented wine. A wedding loaf, half-wrapped in a linen cloth, steamed in the close air of the little chamber, making his stomach growl. The shutters had been put up to afford privacy for this one night.\\n\\n The servants unlaced his sandals, untangled him from the complicated knotwork that belted his tunic, removed her blue linen gown, and quickly enough they both stood silent, she in a thin calf-length linen shift and he in knee-length shift and bare legs.\\n\\n “Go on,” he said, giving each of the servants a few silver sceattas as they slipped out. “May God bless you this night.”\\n\\n At last he was alone with Tallia.\\n\\n She sank down beside the bed in an attitude of prayer, lips pressed to her hands. He could not hear her words. She shivered as at a cold wind, and he saw briefly the shape of her body beneath her shift, the curve of a hip, the ridge of her collarbone, the slight fleeting swell of a breast.\\n\\n Ai, Lord! He spun to the table, poured out some cold water, and splashed it in his face. He had to lean his weight on the table while he fought to recover himself. Distantly he heard the hounds barking wildly. From the great yard he heard music, the nasal squeal of pipes and the thump of drums. No doubt the celebration would go on all night.\\n\\n At last he turned. She had not moved. On a whim, he poured more water into the basin and carried it and a soft cloth over to the bed. Setting it on the floor, he knelt beside her. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-burning-stone-crown-of-stars-3/page-47.html","bookId":2014,"book":{"id":2014,"title":"The Burning Stone (Crown of Stars #3)","description":"Storyline: In the third volume of this astonishing Nebula Award-nominated fantasy series, the many plot strands created in the first two novels become more tightly interwoven--as the time of the cataclysm nears when people and places long sundered by magic will once again reside in the same time and universe...\"The best thus far...I can now honestly say I am rabid for the next book.\"--B\u0026N Explorations \\n Praise for the Crown of Stars series: \\n \"Well-thought-out, well-structured, and well-crafted...
