SwiftDaughters glide forward over the dirt and form the net of story, hands linked, gold and silver and copper and tin and iron hair gleaming as they begin to sway, humming.\n Silence except for that low humming permeates the clearing. Even the dogs do not bark. Distantly, he can almost hear the WiseMothers hearing that silence as speech, turning their attention to this mortal instant.\n Do they know how momentous this day will be? That one day the SwiftDaughters will weave it into their song of history? Or do they laugh at his ambition?\n Soon he will find out.\n The heavy tread of OldMother shudders the ground beneath his knees. She alone judges the worthiness of the contestants. The SwiftDaughters part to let her bulk through. He, with his brothers, bows his head.\n She makes a slow circle. Suddenly, there comes a grunt, the sharp copper taint of blood, and a thud as one of Bloodheart’s sons topples over. His blood soaks into the soil of the dancing ground. Dogs growl, and a few bark and are hushed, or killed.\n He feels the knife of decision brush his head, his throat, and linger at the girdle of shimmering gold he wears at his hips: the girdle woven of the hair of a Hakonin SwiftDaughter.\n Then it moves away. Six sons remain.\n The SwiftDaughters rock back and forth, foot to foot, and begin the long chant, the history of Rikin’s tribe. It will take three days to tell, and when they are done, only one of Bloodheart’s sons will stand on the blood-soaked ground and claim victory.\n The circle parts. He leaps up, knowing better than to be caught by one of the other five and forced into a brute fight: they all outweigh him, they are bigger, brawnier, and stronger.\n But he has strength of a different kind.\n With the dogs and the warriors yammering and howling and barking behind, he races up toward the fjall where the first of his traps lies waiting.\n Alain woke to frenzied barking, the Eika dogs going crazy—\n Only it wasn’t the Eika dogs. Rage barked at his door, scratching insistently, and he heard the others howling and barking from Lavastine’s chambers as if they had gone mad.\n He scrambled to throw his tunic on over his shift. Without bothering with hose he flung open the door. Tallia called out behind him, but he ran on, to Lavastine’s chambers.\n The servants parted before him. They had not dared come too close. One had been bitten, and his arm wept blood. Alain waded into a seething whirlpool of hounds, all of them tearing around the chamber like a dog chasing its tail; only old Terror stood, legs up on the embrasure of the window, growling menacingly. Alain stuck his head out the window, but he saw only worried servingmen and a few curious onlookers who had paused to stare at the commotion. Wind stirred the flowering bushes just outside. A rodent—or an unseen bird—rustled in the leaves, and Fear, Sorrow, and Rage bolted out of the chamber and raced around the long building. People scattered from their path.\n “Peace!” Alain cried, leaning out of the window, as they skittered to a halt on the other side. They sniffed in the bushes. “Sit.” They sat, but they still growled softly at wind and leaves. Behind him, in the chamber, the barking settled and ceased, and the silence that weighed down made his ears ring. He turned to see Lavastine sitting on the bed, half clothed, examining Ardent’s paw. She whimpered as he spread the pads and examined the flesh with a frown.\n Alain crossed to him at once and knelt beside him, then set a hand on Ardent’s flank. Her nose was dry and her breathing came in a labored pant.\n “Bitten,” said Lavastine, “but I know not by what.”\n Alain sat on the bed to examine her paw. She nipped at him weakly when he probed at the flesh, but she trusted him too well to bite him. At first he felt only how hot her paw was; a swelling bubble grew between the pad of two toes. Finally he found the wound, two tiny red punctures.\n “Was she bitten by a snake?”\n Lavastine rose and went to speak to a servant, who quickly left. “We’ll speak with the stablemaster.” The count paced over to the window and stood there, silent, with a hand resting on Terror’s great head.\n Alain swung a leg over Ardent to pin her down, cut the pad of her paw with his knife, and sucked out what of the poison he could, if indeed she had been bitten by something poisonous, then spat it out onto the floor. Her blood had a sour, metallic taste, and it clotted at once, did not even bleed—only seeped from the cut. He offered her water in a basin, but she would not drink.\n Lavastine returned from the window and signed to a servant to help him dress. Another left to get Alain’s clothing. Then Lavastine sat down beside Alain on the bed. He considered Ardent, stroked her head while she lay shuddering and panting hoarsely, not moving otherwise. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-burning-stone-crown-of-stars-3/page-51.html","bookId":2014,"book":{"id":2014,"title":"The Burning Stone (Crown of Stars #3)","description":"Storyline: \n In the third volume of this astonishing Nebula Award-nominated fantasy series, the many plot strands created in the first two novels become more tightly interwoven--as the time of the cataclysm nears when people and places long sundered by magic will once again reside in the same time and universe...\"The best thus far...I can now honestly say I am rabid for the next book.\"--B\u0026N Explorations \n Praise for the Crown of Stars series: \n \"Well-thought-out, well-structured, and well-crafted...
