His niece Tallia shifted in her seat as if his voice had startled her, but she did not look up from her study of her knees. She had a pale face, pale hair, and pale hands, was almost colorless, quite in contrast to the plump young noblewoman who stood in attendance on her with her hands folded quietly before her and her serious gaze flicking now and again toward Alain. “What about this boy, Lackling?” asked Henry. “You seem sure he was Count Lavastine’s bastard. Could he touch the hounds?” “Why, bless you, Your Majesty,” she said with a chuckle, “he hadn’t enough wits to try, nor would anyone let him. He was misshapen in the body, poor lad, as sweet a soul as you might wish, but he was simple in the head.” “I pray you, Your Majesty, have I your permission to speak?” said Alain. His voice warmed Hanna; she had never heard him speak before, but there was nothing nasty or irate in his tone, nothing to trouble one’s heart or scrape raw one’s soul. Henry nodded. “The hounds never troubled Lackling.” It was an astounding observation to make in the face of the really awful accusations just thrown at him by his rival. The young noblewoman sitting at Geoffrey’s side—most likely his wife because she held a young child on her lap—leaned over to whisper in Geoffrey’s ear, and he sat back, looking irritated, but keeping his mouth shut. “What are you saying? I don’t understand your meaning.” Henry sat back in his chair, hands curling over the dragon armrests. Their carved tongues licked out between his fingers, and he rubbed them absently as he listened. “They never troubled him,” repeated Alain. “They never lunged at him or tried to bite him, as they would everyone else.” He pointedly did not look at Geoffrey. “Everyone but you,” retorted Geoffrey. His face went from red to white in an instant, the complexion of a sinning man, or a fearful one. “Because you’re an agent of the Enemy. You used sorcery to enslave them, just as you used sorcery to bind my cousin to your will. We’ve all heard the story that the elder Count Charles Lavastine was accused of having made a pact with the Enemy to get those hounds. Why would any man want them? We’ve all seen and heard how vicious they are. They can only be creatures of the Enemy, and if they obey you, it must be because you are a servant of the Enemy as well!” “Hold!” cried Henry, raising a hand for silence as the crowd began to mutter and stir. The hounds growled softly, but Alain merely touched them on their muzzles and they lay down, resting their great heads on their forelegs. The king paused while Hathui bent to whisper in his ear. He nodded, and she gave an order to a steward, who hurried away. Hanna edged forward on the bench, got stuck again, jammed between a noble lady and her companion. She thought of crawling under the table, but the noble lady’s whippets had hunkered down in a pack under the table and not only did they growl at her as she bent over to survey her chances, but they had made a stinking mess of the rushes underneath. She shoved her way back up on the bench as the king began again to speak. “This is a grave accusation, Lord Geoffrey, not only against Alain but against Count Lavastine, his father the younger Charles, and his grandfather Charles Lavastine as well. Do you mean to imply that all of them were in league with the Enemy?” At once the young noblewoman and an older man who resembled her leaned over to whisper furiously to Geoffrey while he by turns looked irate and mortified. The child on the woman’s lap fussed and was given a fig to chew on to keep it quiet. The crowd had begun talking and there was a buzz of anger below it, like bees smoked out of their hive, but Hanna couldn’t tell who the anger was directed against. Alain did not move except to pat the head of one of the hounds. Tallia glanced at her uncle. She seemed to have eyes for no one but Henry, and even so her gaze was more like that of a rabbit eyeing the hawk that would like to eat it than that of a trusting niece. Hadn’t she married Lord Alain last summer? Of course she had! Why wasn’t she sitting beside him, then? “Nay, Your Majesty,” said Geoffrey finally. “It is evident that Count Lavastine and his father Charles were innocent.” “Then do you lay a claim against the elder Charles Lavastine and his conduct?” “No one knows what he got in return for the hounds, but it brought ill luck into his house. The story goes that his own mother died in childbed the day he got the hounds. He himself never had but one child although he married four different women, and his son had only the one living child although his wife was brought to bed ten or twelve times. My cousin Lavastine had only the one child, and not only were she and her mother murdered by these same hounds, but it was rumored that the girl wasn’t his get at all, that his wife had committed adultery. Two times more he made ready to marry, and both those women died under unnatural circumstances. And last, that same ill luck brought this liar to Lavas Holding, this man who tempted my cousin and bewitched him. And killed him, too, so I hear. Everyone agrees it was sorcery that killed him, some foul creature of the Enemy. Even those who will speak no ill of this bastard acknowledge that my cousin died in an unnatural way. It’s true, isn’t it?” he demanded at last, for the first time glaring belligerently at Alain.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-burning-stone-crown-of-stars-3/page-265.html","bookId":2014,"book":{"id":2014,"title":"The Burning Stone (Crown of Stars #3)","description":"Storyline: In the third volume of this astonishing Nebula Award-nominated fantasy series, the many plot strands created in the first two novels become more tightly interwoven--as the time of the cataclysm nears when people and places long sundered by magic will once again reside in the same time and universe...\"The best thus far...I can now honestly say I am rabid for the next book.\"--B\u0026N Explorations Praise for the Crown of Stars series: \"Well-thought-out, well-structured, and well-crafted...
