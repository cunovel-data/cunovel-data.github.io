{"id":105925,"no":304,"title":"Page 304","content":"“Where do you come from?” Alain asked softly as the last dozen strode by, as silent as corpses, eyes alert although in truth they didn’t really seem to see him. “Where are you going?” “We were caught between one place and the next when the world changed. We were swept out to sea where the ground always shifts beneath our feet. But I feel the tide turning. It is coming back in. As the reckless one said, mayhap the tide will wash us back onto the earth again. Then we will have our revenge.” The prince swung into line behind the last of his soldiers. Light rimmed the horizon. A cock crowed. The thin pinch of the last waning crescent moon floated just above the trees, fading into the dawn. They vanished. Had Alain been slugged in the stomach, he wouldn’t have felt any more like the wind had been knocked right out of him. The stream flowed past, gurgling over the stones, and now it ran the same way it had last night, northeast, into the forest. Or perhaps he had only been dreaming it, before. “What was that?” demanded Thiadbold as everyone began to talk at once. “Captain! Captain!” A man came running. “It’s Leo. He was sentry out by the forest. It’s elfshot, Captain! He’s terrible shot through with fever.” Alain went to the forest’s edge with Captain Thiadbold, the blonde Eagle, and a nervous crowd of Lions, who promptly spread out in pairs to search among the trees. Dawn made them bold. There was no trace on the narrow track that any party, much less one of a hundred or more people, had passed over it during the night. Leo was a man who didn’t say much, and then usually only to swear. He was shaking now, a hand clasped over his right shoulder, but the rash had already spread up his exposed throat. Sweat ran from his neck and forehead. His eyes had the glaze of shock. “Nay, nay,” he was mumbling, trying to push away someone in front of him who didn’t exist. “Nay, nay. Be quiet now or they’ll hear you coming.” “Get his mail off so we can see the wound,” said Thiadbold. He still wore his helm, covering his red hair, but Alain could just see the scarred ear where the leather ear flaps had been pulled askew. “I thought it was a dream,” the captain went on, looking at Alain. “That’s why I went along with what you said. That, and what Hanna said—” He gestured toward the Eagle, who had evidently scrambled up so quickly from her bed that she hadn’t belted up her tunic. “You sounded so sure of yourself—” He shook his head, frowning. Not quite suspicious, but looking as if he were sorry that he’d ever agreed to take on Henry’s new recruit. “Many of us have seen strange things in these days,” said the Eagle. “Strange things in strange times.” Her words produced a flood of anxious commentary from the assembled Lions, broken only when Leo screamed as three of his fellows pinioned him and pulled his mail coat up over his shoulders. Then, thrashing, he rolled on the ground like a madman. “Hush,” said Alain, stepping forward and pressing him down by one shoulder. “God will help you if you will only be still.” Leo moaned, spittle running from his mouth, then fainted. There was no sign of any arrow in his shoulder nor, when Alain probed with his fingers at the little hole pierced in Leo’s shoulder, did he find a point or shaft broken off in the skin. But it was festering. Angry red lines already lanced from the wound, and his skin was rashing and blistering all around it. Alain set his mouth to the wound and sucked, spat, sucked again, spat again, until his jaws ached. “Waybread and prayer for elfshot,” said Alain. “That’s what my Aunt Bel always said.” “A poultice of wormwood to draw out the poison,” added the Eagle, but she gestured toward Thiadbold. “Your healer may know other charms.” “I’ve never seen so strange a sight,” said Thiadbold. “Not once in my ten years as a Lion.” He wasn’t looking at Leo at all, but at Alain. “You were speaking to them, but I couldn’t hear a word they said. They were only shades. Shadows of the Lost Ones. How could you speak to them, who are ghosts? What manner of man are you?” Folquin and Ingo shoved their way through the crowd of Lions. “Here, Alain,” said Folquin too heartily, but he reached down to grasp one of Leo’s legs. “Let’s carry him back to camp.” “We can rig a place on one of the wagons,” said Ingo, drawing Thiadbold aside. “It won’t take much time. We won’t lose much on the march. I’d just as soon be through this forest before twilight.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-burning-stone-crown-of-stars-3/page-304.html","bookId":2014,"book":{"id":2014,"title":"The Burning Stone (Crown of Stars #3)","description":"Storyline: In the third volume of this astonishing Nebula Award-nominated fantasy series, the many plot strands created in the first two novels become more tightly interwoven--as the time of the cataclysm nears when people and places long sundered by magic will once again reside in the same time and universe...\"The best thus far...I can now honestly say I am rabid for the next book.\"--B\u0026N Explorations Praise for the Crown of Stars series: \"Well-thought-out, well-structured, and well-crafted...
