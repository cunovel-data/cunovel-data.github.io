His fingers seemed as cold as marble. “See that it is burned, but out away from the village where the smoke cannot poison anyone.” Across the room, Terror whimpered, and suddenly the count’s cool expression faltered, and the shadow of death flickered in his eyes. “Ai, God. My old Terror. Most faithful.” “Here, now,” said Alain brusquely, “sit there, Father.” He grabbed the knife from the floor and cut a cross over the wound, then set his own mouth to it and sucked, although Lavastine began to protest but gave up. His blood tasted as bitter as hope. Alain spat it out on the floor, sucked again, and again, and then did the same for Terror while the servants hurried to get hot water, cloth to bind the wound, and a shovel to carry away the dead creature. The deacon came as the sun rose. She busied herself making a poultice, and Alain sent a messenger to the monastery of St. Synodios, asking them to send their Brother Infirmarian at once. Lavastine sat throughout as calm as stone, and never once cried out in pain, never cursed the Eika enchanter, only waited, stroking Terror’s head, and watched with that least smile, the one that denoted his approval, while Alain ordered the servants and then, finally, because there was nothing else to do, knelt beside him and prayed. PART TWO THE TURNING WHEEL VIII THAT WHICH BLINDS 1 “HERE comes the young lord!” Alain heard the shout rise up as his entourage rounded the forest path and came to a halt in a clearing. Ten huts stood along the path with narrow garden strips stretching out behind each one. A score of cows grazed along the forest’s verge. Fields of winter rye sprouted beyond the village. He dismounted and gave his reins to a groom. “This is the disputed land?” he asked his steward, but already the village folk swarmed forward and in the old tradition began clamoring all together to get his attention. A steward brought his stool, and he sat down, although that did nothing to mitigate the outcry. So he just sat, calmly regarding them with Sorrow on one side, Rage on the other, and Fear flopped down at his feet, and after a while one and then another stopped shouting and gesticulating as, one by one, they realized he did not intend to speak until there was silence. In time, because he was patient, they all stood respectfully before him and waited. “It has come to the attention of my father, Count Lavastine, that certain disputes have disrupted the peace of this village and that several men have been injured in fighting. It is my father’s will that no feuding be allowed on his lands, so I have come I settle the matter. Let those with an interest each come forward—No!” He had to raise his voice as several crowded forward at once, arms raised to get his attention. “Each person will have opportunity to speak, no matter how long it takes.” Their testimony took a while to give, and it was cold word especially since he was obligated to sit still and listen under a chill autumn sky. But he had a fine, fur-lined wool cloak, and in addition, he never wanted for hot cider brought to him by the village children. He listened, because he was good at listening, and after a while as the village folk saw they would truly each be heard, a certain temperance settled over their speech and they began to accuse less and explain more. Once he had sorted through their complaints of each other and the petty injustices and quarrels over the meadowland, grazing rights, division of rents paid to their lord out of the common rye fields, how to parcel out the remaining fallow lands, and how often to let the fields lie fallow, he lifted a hand for silence. “This is the root of what I hear you say: that you have a prospered so well under the rule of Count Lavastine that there isn’t enough land for your children to inherit so they can each have a portion as large as the one you have worked in your time.” They dared not quarrel with his opinion, but he saw the idea take hold in their minds. Once he had seen the pattern emerge, he knew how Lavastine and Aunt Bel would answer it and he wanted to do the best he could. In truth, he could have sent a steward to deal with the problem, but with Lavastine ill he needed to be seen. And anyway, staying busy kept his mind off Tallia. “It is my will as heir to these lands that you be rewarded, not punished, for your hard work, but it is also necessary that these disputes end. Therefore, in the name of my father, I will allow you to cultivate clearings within the forest, which has up to now been reserved for foraging, pigs, and hunting. But you must take only two harvests from any field there, and then move on to clear new fields, and you must not return to any field previously cleared for at least ten years. For every five measure of grain reaped, one shall be given to the count’s granary. For one plowing a year you shall have the use of an iron-sheathed plow from Lavas Holding. In the name of my father, and in my own name, I have spoken.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-burning-stone-crown-of-stars-3/page-156.html","bookId":2014,"book":{"id":2014,"title":"The Burning Stone (Crown of Stars #3)","description":"Storyline: In the third volume of this astonishing Nebula Award-nominated fantasy series, the many plot strands created in the first two novels become more tightly interwoven--as the time of the cataclysm nears when people and places long sundered by magic will once again reside in the same time and universe...\"The best thus far...I can now honestly say I am rabid for the next book.\"--B\u0026N Explorations Praise for the Crown of Stars series: \"Well-thought-out, well-structured, and well-crafted...
