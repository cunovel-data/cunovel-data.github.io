{"id":43664,"no":12,"title":"Part Two Chapter 2","content":"Fyodor took his short-stemmed pipe out of his mouth and poked reflectively at the ash in the bowl with a cautious finger; the pipe was out. \n A dense cloud of grey smoke from a dozen cigarettes hovered below the ceiling and over the chair where sat the Chairman of the Gubernia Executive Committee. From the corners of the room the faces of the people seated around the table were only dimly visible through the haze. \n Tokarev, sitting next to the Chairman, leaned forward and plucked irritably at his sparse beard, glancing now and again out of the corner of his eye at a short, bald-headed man whose high-pitched voice went on endlessly stringing out phrases that were as empty and meaningless as a sucked egg. \n Akim caught the look in the old worker\u0027s eye and was reminded of a fighting cock back in his childhood days in the village who had had the same wicked look in his eye just before pouncing on his adversary. \n The Gubernia Party Committee had been in conference for more than an hour. The bald man was Chairman of the Railway Firewood Committee. \n Leafing with nimble fingers through the heap of papers before him, the bald man rattled on: \".. \n .Under these circumstances it is clearly impossible to carry out the decision of the Gubernia Committee and the railway management. I repeat, even a month from now we shall not be able to give more than four hundred cubic metres of firewood. As for the one hundred and eighty thousand cubic metres required, well, that\u0027s sheer...\" the speaker fumbled for the right word, \"er... sheer utopia!\" he wound up and his small mouth pursed itself up into an expression of injury. There was a long silence. \n Fyodor tapped his pipe with his fingernail and knocked out the ashes. It was Tokarev who finally broke the silence. \n \"There\u0027s no use wasting our breath,\" he began in his rumbling bass. \"The Railway Firewood Committee hasn\u0027t any firewood, never had any, and doesn\u0027t expect any in the future.... Right?\" \n The bald man shrugged a shoulder. \n \"Excuse me, Comrade, we did stock up firewood, but the shortage of road transport....\" He swallowed, wiped his polished pate with a checkered handkerchief; he made several fruitless attempts to stuff the handkerchief back into his pocket, and finally shoved it nervously under his portfolio. \n \"What have you done about delivering the wood? After all, a good many days have passed since the leading specialists mixed up in the conspiracy were arrested,\" Denekko observed from his corner. \n The bald man turned to him. \"I wrote the railway administration three times stating that unless we had the proper transport facilities it would be impossible....\" \n Tokarev stopped him. \"We\u0027ve heard that already,\" he said coldly, eyeing the bald man with hostility. \"Do you take us for a pack of fools?\" \n The bald man felt a chill run down his spine at these words. \n \"I cannot answer for the actions of counter-revolutionaries,\" he replied in a low voice. \n \"But you knew, didn\u0027t you, that the timber was being felled a long distance from the railway line?\" \n \"I heard about it, but I could not bring the attention of my superiors to irregularities on a sector outside my province.\" \n \"How many men have you on the job?\" the chairman of the trade union council demanded. \n \"About two hundred,\" the bald man replied. \n \"That makes a cubic metre a year for every parasite!\" fumed Tokarev. \n \"The Railway Firewood Committee has been allotted special rations, food the workers ought to be getting, and look what you\u0027re doing? What happened to those two carriages of flour you received for the workers?\" the trade union chairman persisted. \n Similar pointed questions rained down on the bald man from all sides and he answered them in the harassed manner of a man trying to ward off annoying creditors. He twisted and turned like an eel to avoid direct answers, but his eyes darted nervously about him. He sensed danger and his cowardly soul craved but one thing: to get away from here as quickly as possible and slink off to his cosy nest, to his supper and his still youthful wife who was probably cosily whiling away the time with a Paul de Kock novel. \n Lending an attentive ear to the bald man\u0027s replies, Fyodor scribbled in his notebook: \"I believe this man ought to be checked up on properly. This is more than mere incompetence. I know one or two things about him.... Stop the discussion and let him go so we can get down to business.\" \n The Chairman read the note and nodded to Fyodor. \n Zhukhrai rose and went out into the corridor to make a telephone call. When he returned the Chairman was reading the resolution: \n \". . .to remove the management of the Railway Firewood Committee for downright sabotage, the matter of the timber workings to be turned over to the investigation authorities.\" \n The bald man had expected worse. True, to be removed from his post for downright sabotage would raise the question of his reliability in general, but that was a mere trifle. As for the Boyarka business, he was not worried, that was not his province after all. \"A close shave, though,\" he said to himself, \"I thought they had really dug up something. ...\" \n Now almost reassured, he remarked as he put his papers back into his portfolio: \"Of course, I am a non-Party specialist and you are at liberty to distrust me. But my conscience is clear. If I have failed to do what was required of me that was because it was impossible.\" \n No one made any comment. The bald man went out, hurried downstairs, and opened the street door with a feeling of intense relief. \n \"Your name, please?\" a man in an army coat accosted him. \n With a sinking heart the baldhead stammered: \"Cher. . . vinsky....\" \n Upstairs as soon as the outsider was gone, thirteen heads bent closer over the large conference table. \n \"See here,\" Zhukhrai\u0027s finger jabbed the unfolded map. \"That\u0027s Boyarka station. The timber felling is six versts away. There are two hundred and ten thousand cubic metres of wood stacked up at this point: a whole army of men worked hard for eight months to pile up all that wood, and what\u0027s the result? Treachery. The railway and the town are without firewood. To haul that timber six versts to the station would take five thousand carts no less than one month, and that only if they made two trips a day. The nearest village is fifteen versts away. What\u0027s more, Orlik and his band are prowling about in those parts. You realise what this means? Look, according to the plan the felling was to have been started right here and continued in the direction of the station, and those scoundrels carried it right into the depths of the forest. The purpose was to make sure we would not be able to haul the firewood to the railway line. And they weren\u0027t far wrong — we can\u0027t even get a hundred carts for the job. It\u0027s a foul blow they\u0027ve struck us. The uprising was no more serious than this.\" \n Zhukhrai\u0027s clenched fist dropped heavily onto the waxed paper of the map. Each of the thirteen clearly visualised the grimmer aspects of the situation which Zhukhrai had omitted to mention. \n Winter was in the offing. They saw hospitals, schools, offices and hundreds of thousands of people caught in the icy grip of the frost; the railway stations swarming with people and only one train a week to handle the traffic. \n There was deep silence as each man pondered the situation. \n At length Fyodor relaxed his fist. \n \"There is one way out, Comrades,\" he said. \n \"We must build a seven-verst narrow-gauge line from the station to the timber tract in three months. The first section leading to the beginning of the tract must be ready in six weeks. I\u0027ve been working on this for the past week. We\u0027ll need,\" Zhukhrai\u0027s voice cracked in his dry throat, \"three hundred and fifty workers and two engineers. There is enough rails and seven engines at Pushcha-Voditsa. The Komsomols dug them up in the warehouses. There was a project to lay a narrow-gauge line from Pushcha-Voditsa to the town before the war. The trouble is there are no accommodations in Boyarka for the workers, the place is in ruins. We\u0027ll have to send the men in \n small groups for a fortnight at a time, they won\u0027t be able to hold out any longer than that. Shall we send the Komsomols, Akim?\" And without waiting for an answer, he went on: \"The Komsomol will rush as many of its members to the spot as possible. There\u0027s the Solomenka organisation to begin with, and some from the town. The-task is hard, very hard, but if the youngsters are told what is at stake I\u0027m certain they\u0027ll do it.\" \n The chief of the railway shook his head dubiously. \n \"I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s no use. To lay seven versts of track in the woods under such conditions, with the autumn rains due and the frosts coming...\" he began wearily. But Zhukhrai cut him short. \"You ought to have paid more attention to the firewood problem, Andrei Vasilievich. That line has got to be built and we\u0027re going to build it. We\u0027re not going to fold our hands and freeze to death,are we?\" \n \n The last crates of tools were loaded onto the train. The train crew took their places. A fine drizzle was falling. Crystal raindrops rolled down Rita\u0027s glistening leather jacket. \n Rita shook hands warmly with Tokarev. \"We wish you luck,\" she said softly. \n The old man regarded her affectionately from beneath his bushy grey eyebrows. \n \"Yes, they\u0027ve given us a peck of trouble, blast \u0027em,\" he growled in answer to his own thoughts. \n \"You here had better look to things, so that if there\u0027s any hitch over there you can put a bit of pressure on where it\u0027s needed. These good-for-nothings here can\u0027t do anything without a lot of red tape. Well, time I was getting aboard, daughter.\" \n The old man buttoned up his jacket. At the last moment Rita inquired casually: \"Isn\u0027t Korchagin going along? I didn\u0027t notice him among the boys.\" \n \"No, he and the job superintendent went out there yesterday by handcar to prepare for our coming.\" \n At that moment Zharky, Dubava, and Anna Borhart with her jacket thrown carelessly across her shoulders and a cigarette between her slender fingers, came hurrying down the platform toward them. \n Rita had time to ask Tokarev one more question before the others joined them. \n \"How are your studies with Korchagin getting along?\" \n The old man looked at her in surprise. \n \"What studies? The lad\u0027s under your wing, isn\u0027t he? He\u0027s told me a lot about you. Thinks the world of you.\" \n Rita looked sceptical. \"Are you quite sure, Comrade Tokarev? Didn\u0027t he always go to you for a proper explanation after his lessons with me?\" \n The old man burst out laughing. \"To me? Why, I never saw hide or hair of him.\" \n The engine shrieked. Klavicek shouted from one of the carriages: \n \"Hey, Comrade Ustinovich, give us our daddy back! What\u0027d we do without him?\" \n The Czech was about to say something else, but catching sight of the three late-comers he checked himself. He noticed the anxious look in Anna\u0027s eyes, caught with a pang her parting smile to Dubava and turned quickly away from the window. \n \n The autumn rain lashed the face. Low clouds, leaden-hued and swollen with moisture, crawled over the earth. Late autumn had stripped the woods bare; and the old hornbeams looked gaunt and downcast, their wrinkled trunks hidden under the brown moss. Remorseless autumn had robbed them of their luxuriant garments, and they stood there naked and pitiful. \n The little station building huddled forlornly in the midst of the forest. A strip of freshly dug earth ran from the stone freight platform into the woods. Around this strip men swarmed like ants. \n The clayey mud squelched unpleasantly underfoot. There was a ringing of crowbars and a grating of spades on stone over by the embankment where the men were furiously digging. \n The rain came down as if through a fine sieve and the chill drops penetrated the men\u0027s clothing. \n The rain threatened to wash away what their labour had accomplished, for the clay slid down the embankment in a soggy mass. \n Soaked to the skin, their clothing chill and sodden, the men worked on until long after dark. \n And with every day the strip of upturned earth penetrated farther and farther into the forest. \n Not far from the station loomed the grim skeleton of what had once been a brick building. \n Everything that could be removed bodily, torn out or blasted loose had long since been carried off by marauders. There were gaping holes in place of windows and doors; black gashes where stove doors had once been. Through the holes in the tattered roof the rafters showed like the ribs of a skeleton. \n Only the concrete floor in the four large rooms remained intact. At night four hundred men slept on this floor in their damp, mud-caked clothing. Muddy water streamed from their clothes when they wrung them out at the doorway. And the men heaped bitter curses on the rain and the boggy soil. They lay in compact rows on the concrete floor with its thin covering of straw, huddling together for warmth. The steam rose from their clothing but it did not dry. And the rain seeped through the sacks that were nailed over the empty window frames and trickled down onto the floor. It drummed loudly on the remnants of sheet metal roofing, and the wind whistled through \n the great cracks in the door. In the morning they drank tea in the tumbledown barracks that served for a kitchen, and went off to their work. Dinner, day after day with sickening monotony, consisted of plain boiled lentils, and there was a daily allowance of a pound and a half of bread as black as coal. \n That was all the town could provide. The job superintendent, Valerian Nikodimovich Patoshkin, a tall spare old man with two deep lines at his mouth, and technician Vakulenko, a thickset man with a coarse-featured face and a fleshy nose, had put up at the station master\u0027s house. \n Tokarev shared the tiny room occupied by the station Cheka agent, a small, volatile man named Kholyava. \n The men endured the hardships with dogged fortitude, and the railway embankment reached farther into the forest from day to day. \n True, there had been some desertions: at first nine, and a few days later, another five. \n The first major calamity occurred a week after the work started, when the bread supply failed to arrive with the night train. \n \n Dubava woke Tokarev and told him the news. The secretary of the Party group swung his hairy legs over the side of the bed and scratched himself furiously under the armpit. \n \"The fun\u0027s beginning!\" he growled and began hastily to dress. \n Kholyava waddled in on his short legs. \n \"Run down to the telephone and call the Special Department,\" Tokarev instructed him, and turning to Dubava added, \"and not a word to anybody about the bread, mind.\" \n After berating the railway telephone operators for a full half hour, the irrepressible Kholyava succeeded in getting Zhukhrai, the assistant chief of the Special Department, on the line, while Tokarev stood by fidgeting with impatience. \n \"What! Bread not delivered? I\u0027ll find out who\u0027s responsible for that!\" Zhukhrai\u0027s voice coming over the wire had an ominous ring. \n \"What are we going to give the men to eat tomorrow?\" Tokarev shouted back angrily. \n There was a long pause; Zhukhrai was evidently considering some plan of action. \"You\u0027ll get the bread tonight,\" he said at last. \"I\u0027ll send young Litke with the car. He knows the way. You\u0027ll have the bread by morning.\" \n At dawn a mud-spattered car loaded with sacks of bread drove up to the station. Litke, his face white and strained after a sleepless night at the wheel, climbed out wearily. \n Work on the railway line became a struggle against increasing odds. The railway administration announced that there were no sleepers to be had. The town authorities could find no means of shipping the rails and engines to the railway job, and the engines themselves turned out to be in need of substantial repairs. No workers were forthcoming to replace the first batch who had done their share and were now so completely worn out that there could be no question of detaining them. \n The leading Party members met in the tumbledown shed dimly lit by a wick lamp and sat up late into the night discussing the situation. \n The following morning Tokarev, Dubava and Klavicek went to town, taking six men with them to repair the engines and speed up the shipment of the rails. Klavicek, who was a baker by trade, was sent as inspector to the supply department, while the rest went on to Pushcha-Voditsa. \n The rain poured down without ceasing. \n \n Pavel Korchagin pulled his foot out of the sticky slime with an effort. A sharp sensation of cold told him that the worn sole of his boot had finally parted from the uppers. His torn boots had been a source of keen discomfort to Pavel ever since he had come to the job. They were never dry and the mud that filtered in squelched when he walked. Now one sole was gone altogether and the icy mire cut into his bare foot. Pavel pulled the sole out of the mud and regarded it with despair and \n broke the vow he had given himself not to swear. He could not go on working with one foot exposed, so he hobbled back to the barracks, sat down beside the field kitchen, took off his muddy footcloth and stretched out his numb foot to the fire. \n Odarka, the lineman\u0027s wife who worked as cook\u0027s helper, was busy cutting up beetroots at the kitchen table. A woman of generous proportions, still youthful, with broad almost masculine shoulders, an ample bosom and massive hips, she wielded the kitchen knife with vigour and the mountain of sliced vegetables grew rapidly under her nimble fingers. \n \n Odarka threw a careless glance at Pavel and snapped at him: \n \"If it\u0027s dinner you\u0027re hankering after you\u0027re a bit early, my lad. Ought to be ashamed of yourself sneaking away from work like that! Take your feet off that stove. This is a kitchen, not a bathhouse!\" \n The cook came in at that point. \n \"My blasted boot has gone to pieces,\" Pavel said, explaining his untimely presence in the kitchen. \n The elderly cook looked at the battered boot and nodding toward Odarka he said: \"Her husband might be able to do something with it, he\u0027s a bit of a cobbler. Better see to it or you\u0027ll be in a bad way. You can\u0027t get along without boots.\" \n When she heard this, Odarka took another look at Pavel. \n \"I took you for a loafer,\" she admitted. \n Pavel smiled to show that there were no hard feelings. Odarka examined the boot with the eye of an expert. \n \"There\u0027s no use trying to patch it,\" she concluded. \n \"But I\u0027ll tell you what I can do. I\u0027ll bring you an old galosh we\u0027ve got lying around at home and you can wear it on top of the boot. You can\u0027t go around like that, you\u0027ll kill yourself! The frosts will start any day now!\" \n And Odarka, now all sympathy, laid down her knife and hurried out, returning shortly with a deep galosh and a strip of stout linen. \n As he wrapped his foot, now warm and dry, in the thick linen and put it into the galosh, Pavel rewarded Odarka with a grateful look. \n \n Tokarev came back from town fuming. He called a meeting of the leading Communists in Kholyava\u0027s room and told them the unpleasant news. \n \"Nothing but obstacles all along the line. Wherever you go the wheels seem to be turning but they don\u0027t get anywhere. Far too many of those White rats about, and it looks as if there\u0027ll be enough to last our lifetime anyway. I tell you, boys, things look bad. There are no replacements for us yet and no one knows how many there will be. The frosts are due any day now, and we must get through the marsh before then at all costs, because when the ground freezes it\u0027ll be too late. So while they\u0027re shaking up those fellows in town who\u0027re making a mess of things, we here have to double our speed. That line has got to be built and we\u0027re going to build it if we die doing it. \n Otherwise it isn\u0027t Bolsheviks we\u0027ll be but jelly-fish.\" There was a steely note in Tokarev\u0027s hoarse bass voice, and his eyes under their bushy brows had a stubborn gleam. \n \"We\u0027ll call a closed meeting today and pass on the news to our Party members and tomorrow we\u0027ll all get down to work. In the morning we\u0027ll let the non-Party fellows go; the rest of us will stay. \n Here\u0027s the Gubernia Committee decision,\" he said, handing Pankratov a folded sheet of paper. \n Pavel Korchagin, peering over Pankratov\u0027s shoulder, read: \"In view of the emergency all members of the Komsomol are to remain on the job and are not to be relieved until the first consignment of firewood is forthcoming. Signed R. Ustinovich, on behalf of the Secretary of the Gubernia Committee.\" \n The kitchen barracks was packed. One hundred and twenty men had squeezed themselves into its narrow confines. They stood against the walls, climbed on the tables and some were even perched on top of the field kitchen. \n Pankratov opened the meeting. Then Tokarev made a brief speech winding up with an announcement that had the effect of a bombshell: \n \"The Communists and Komsomols will not leave the job tomorrow.\" \n The old man accompanied his statement with a gesture that stressed the finality of the \"decision. It swept away all cherished hopes of returning to town, going home, getting away from this hole. \n A roar of angry voices drowned out everything else for a few moments. The swaying bodies caused the feeble oil light to flicker fitfully. In the semidarkness the commotion increased. They wanted to go \"home\"; they protested indignantly that they had had as much as they could stand. \n Some received the news in silence. And only one man spoke of deserting. \n \"To hell with it all!\" he shouted angrily from his corner, loosing an ugly stream of invective. \"I\u0027m not going to stay here another day. It\u0027s all right to do hard labour if you\u0027ve committed a crime. But what have we done? We\u0027re fools to stand for it. We\u0027ve had two weeks of it, and that\u0027s enough. Let those who made the decision come out and do the work themselves. Maybe some folks like poking around in this muck, but I\u0027ve only one life to live. I\u0027m leaving tomorrow.\" \n The voice came from behind Okunev and he lit a match to see who it was. For an instant the speaker\u0027s rage-distorted face and open mouth were snatched out of the darkness by the match\u0027s flame. But that instant was enough for Okunev to recognise the son of a gubernia food commissariat bookkeeper. \n \"Checking up, eh?\" he snarled. \"Well, I\u0027m not afraid, I\u0027m no thief.\" \n The match flickered out. Pankratov rose and drew himself up to his full height. \n \"What kind of talk is that? Who dares to compare a Party task to a hard-labour sentence?\" he thundered, running his eyes menacingly over the front rows. \"No, Comrades, there\u0027s no going to town for us, our place is here. If we clear out now folks will freeze to death. The sooner we finish the job the sooner we get back home. Running away like that whiner back there suggests doesn\u0027t fit in with our ideas or our discipline.\" \n Pankratov, a stevedore, was not fond of long speeches but even this brief statement was interrupted by the same irate voice. \n \"The non-Party fellows are leaving, aren\u0027t they?\" \n \"Yes.\" \n A lad in a short overcoat came elbowing his way to the front. A Komsomol card flew up, struck against Pankratov\u0027s chest, dropped onto the table and stood on edge. \n \"There, take your card. I\u0027m not going to risk my health for a bit of cardboard!\" \n His last words were drowned out by a roar of angry voices: \n \"What do you think you\u0027re throwing around!\" \n \"Treacherous bastard!\" \n \"Got into the Komsomol because he thought he\u0027d have it easy.\" \n \"Chuck him out!\" \n \"Let me get at the louse!\" \n The deserter, his head lowered, made his way to the exit. They let him pass, shrinking away from him as from a leper. The door closed with a creak behind him. \n Pankratov picked up the discarded membership card and held it to the flame of the oil lamp. \n The cardboard caught alight and curled up as it burned. \n \n A shot echoed in the forest. A horseman turned from the tumbledown barracks and dived into the darkness of the forest. A moment later men came pouring out of the barracks and school building. \n Someone discovered a piece of plywood that had been stuck into the door. A match flared up and shielding the unsteady flame from the wind they read the scrawled message: \"Clear out of here and go back where you came from. If you don\u0027t, we will shoot every one of you. I give you till tomorrow night to get out. Ataman Chesnok.\" \n Chesnok belonged to Orlik\u0027s band. \n \n An open diary lies on the table in Rita\u0027s room. \n \n December 2 \n \n \"We had our first snow this morning. The frost is severe. I met Vyacheslav Olshinsky on the stairs and we walked down the street together. \n \" \u0027I always enjoy the first snowfall,\u0027 he said. \u0027Particularly when it is frosty like this. Lovely, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 \n \"But I was thinking of Boyarka and I told him that the frost and snow do not gladden me at all. On the contrary they depress me. And I told him why. \n \" \u0027That is a purely subjective reaction,\u0027 he said. \u0027If one argues on that premise all merriment or any manifestation of joy in wartime, for example, would have to be banned. But life is not like that. \n The tragedy is confined to the strip of front line where the battle is being fought. There life is overshadowed by the proximity of death. Yet even there people laugh. And away from the front, life goes on as always: people laugh, weep, suffer, rejoice, love, seek amusement, entertainment, excitement.\u0027 \n \"It was difficult to detect any shade of irony in Olshinsky\u0027s words. Olshinsky is a representative of the People\u0027s Commissariat of Foreign Affairs. He has been in the Party since 1917. He dresses well, is always cleanly shaven with a faint scent of perfume about him. He lives in our house, in Segal\u0027s apartment. Sometimes he drops in to see me in the evenings. He is very interesting to talk to, he knows a lot about Europe, lived for many years in Paris. But I doubt whether he and I could \n ever be good friends. That is because for him I am primarily a woman; the fact that I am his Party comrade is a secondary consideration. True, he does not attempt to disguise his sentiments and opinions on this score, he has the courage of his convictions and there is nothing coarse about his attentions. He has the knack of investing them with a sort of beauty. Yet I do not like him. \n \"The gruff simplicity of Zhukhrai is far more to my taste than all Olshinsky\u0027s polished European manners. \n \"News from Boyarka comes in the form of brief reports. Each day another two hundred yards laid. \n They are laying the sleepers straight on the frozen earth, hewing out shallow beds for them. There are only two hundred and forty men on the job. Half of the replacements deserted. The conditions there are truly frightful. I can\u0027t imagine how they will be able to carry on in the frost. Dubava has been gone a week now. They were only able to repair five of the eight engines at Pushcha-Voditsa, there were not enough parts for the others. \n \"Dmitri has had criminal charges laid against him by the tramcar authorities. He and his brigade held up all the flatcars belonging to the tram system running to town from Pushcha-Voditsa, cleared off the passengers and loaded the cars with rails for the Boyarka line. They brought 19 carloads of rails along the tram tracks to the railway station in town. The tram crews were only too glad to help. \n \"The Solomenka Komsomols still in town worked all night loading the rails onto railway cars and Dmitri and his brigade went off with them to Boyarka. \n \"Akim refused to have Dubava\u0027s action taken up at the Komsomol Bureau. Dmitri has told us about the outrageous bureaucracy and red tape in the tramcar administration. They flatly refused to give more than two cars for the job. \n \"Tufta, however, privately reprimanded Dubava. \u0027It\u0027s time to drop these partisan tactics,\u0027 he said, \u0027or you\u0027ll find yourself in jail before you know it. Surely you could have come to some agreement without resorting to force of arms?\u0027 \n \"I had never seen Dubava so furious. \n \" \u0027Why didn\u0027t you try talking to them yourself, you rotten pen-pusher?\u0027 he stormed. \u0027All you can do is sit here warming your chair and wagging your tongue. How do you think I could go back to Boyarka without those rails? Instead of hanging around here and getting in everybody\u0027s hair you ought to be sent out there to do some useful work. Tokarev would knock some sense into you!\u0027 \n Dmitri roared so loudly he could be heard all over the building. \n \"Tufta wrote a complaint against Dubava, but Akim asked me to leave the room and talked to him alone for about ten minutes, after which Tufta stamped out red and fuming.\" \n \n December 3 \n \n \"The Gubernia Committee has received another complaint, this time from the Transport Cheka. It appears that Pankratov, Okunev and several other comrades went to Motovilovka station and removed all the doors and window frames from the empty buildings. When they were loading all this onto a freight train the station Cheka man tried to arrest them. They disarmed him, emptied his revolver and returned it to him only after the train was in motion. They got away with the doors and window frames. \n \"Tokarev is charged by the supply department of the railway for taking twenty poods of nails from the Boyarka railway stocks. He gave the nails to the peasants in payment for their help in hauling the timber they are using for sleepers. \n \"I spoke to Comrade Zhukhrai about all these complaints. But he only laughed. \u0027We\u0027ll take care of all that,\u0027 he said. \n \"The situation at the railway job is very tense and now every day is precious. We have to bring pressure to bear here for every trifle. Every now and then we have to summon hinderers to the Gubernia Committee. And over at the job the boys are overriding all formalities more and more often. \n \"Olshinsky has brought me a little electric stove. Olga Yureneva and I warm our hands over it, but it doesn\u0027t make the room any warmer. I wonder how those men in the woods are faring this bitter cold night? Olga tells me that it is so cold in the hospital that the patients shiver under their blankets. The place is heated only once in two days. \n \"No, Comrade Olshinsky, a tragedy at the front is a tragedy in the rear too!\" \n \n December 4 \n \n \"It snowed all night. From Boyarka they write that everything is snowbound and they have had to stop working to clear the track. Today the Gubernia Committee passed a decision that the first section of the railway, up to where the wood was being cut, is to be ready not later than January 1,1922. When this decision reached Boyarka, Tokarev is said to have remarked: \u0027We\u0027ll do it, if we don\u0027t croak by then.\u0027 \n \"I hear nothing at all about Korchagin. I\u0027m rather surprised that he hasn\u0027t been mixed up in something like the Pankratov \u0027case\u0027. I still don\u0027t understand why he avoids me.\" \n \n December 5 \n \n \"Yesterday there was a bandit raid on the railway job.\" \n \n The horses trod warily in the soft, yielding snow. Now and then a twig hidden under the snow would snap under a hoof and the horse would snort and shy, but a sharp rap over its laid-back ears would send it galloping after the others. \n Some dozen horsemen crossed the hilly ridge beyond which lay a strip of dark earth not yet blanketed with snow. Here the riders reined in their horses. There was a faint clink as stirrup met stirrup. The leader\u0027s stallion, its coat glossy with sweat after the long run, shook itself noisily. \n \"There\u0027s a hell of a lot of them here,\" said the head rider in Ukrainian. \"But we\u0027ll soon put the fear of God into \u0027em. The ataman said the bastards were to be chased out of here by tomorrow. They\u0027re getting too damned close to the firewood.\" \n They rode up to the station single file, hugging the sides of the narrow-gauge line. In sight of the clearing near the old school building they slowed down to a walking pace and came to a halt behind the trees, not venturing out into the open. \n A volley rent the silence of the night. A layer of snow dropped squirrel-like off the branch of a birch that gleamed like silver in the light of the moon. Gunfire flashed among the trees, bullets bored into crumbling plaster and there was a tinkling of broken glass as Pan-kratov\u0027s window panes were smashed to smithereens. \n The men on the concrete floor leapt up at the shooting only to drop back again on top of one another when the lethal insects began to fly about the room. \n \"Where you going?\" Dubava seized Pavel by the coat tail. \n \"Outside.\" \n \"Get down, you idiot!\" Dmitri hissed. \"They\u0027ll get you the moment you stick your head out.\" \n \n They lay side by side next to the door. Dubava was flattened against the floor, with his revolver pointing toward the door. Pavel sat on his haunches nervously fingering the drum of his revolver. \n There were five rounds in it — one chamber was empty. He turned the cylinder another notch. \n The shooting ceased suddenly. The silence that followed was weighted with tension. \n \"All those who have weapons come this way,\" Dubava commanded in a hoarse whisper. \n Pavel opened the door cautiously. The clearing was deserted. Snowflakes were falling softly. \n In the forest ten horsemen were whipping their mounts into a gallop. \n The next day a trolley arrived from town. Zhukhrai and Akim alighted and were met by Tokarev and Kholyava. A machine-gun, several crates of cartridge belts and two dozen rifles were unloaded onto the platform. \n They hurried over to the railway line. The tails of Fyodor\u0027s long greatcoat trailed a zigzag pattern in the snow behind him. He still walked with the clumsy rolling gait of the seaman, as if he were pacing the pitching deck of a destroyer. Long-legged Akim walked in step with Fyodor, but Tokarev had to break into a trot now and again to keep up with them. \n \"The bandit raid is not our worst trouble. There\u0027s a nasty rise in the ground right in the path of the line. Just our bad luck. It\u0027ll mean a lot of extra digging.\" \n The old man stopped, turned his back to the wind and lit a cigarette, cupping his hand over the match. After blowing out a few puffs of smoke he hurried to catch up with the others. Akim had stopped to wait for him, but Zhukhrai strode on ahead. \n \"Do you think you\u0027ll be able to finish the line on time?\" Akim asked Tokarev. \n Tokarev paused a while before replying. \n \"Well, it\u0027s like this, son,\" he said at last. \"Generally speaking it can\u0027t be done. But it\u0027s got to be done, so there you are.\" \n They caught up with Fyodor and continued abreast. \n \"Here\u0027s how it is,\" Tokarev began earnestly. \"Only two of us here, Patoshkin and I, know that it\u0027s impossible to build a line under these conditions, with the scanty equipment and labour power we have. But all the others, every last man of them, know that the line has got to be built at all costs. \n So you see that\u0027s why I said if we don\u0027t freeze to death, it\u0027ll be done. Judge for yourselves: we\u0027ve been digging here for over a month, the fourth batch of replacements are due for a rest, but the main body of workers have been on the job all the time. It\u0027s only their youth that keeps them going. But half of them are badly chilled. Makes your heart bleed to look at them. These lads are worth their weight in gold. But this cursed hole will be the death of more than one of them.\" \n \n The ready narrow-gauge track came to an end a kilometre from the station. Beyond that, for a stretch of about one and a half kilometres, the levelled roadbed was covered by what looked like a log palisade blown down by wind — these were the sleepers, all firmly planted in place. And beyond them, all the way to the rise, there was only a level road. \n Pankratov\u0027s building crew No. 1 was working at this section. Forty men were laying ties, while a carroty-bearded peasant wearing a new pair of bast shoes was unhurriedly emptying a load of logs on the roadbed. Several more sleds were being unloaded a little farther away. Two long iron bars lay on the ground — these were used to level up the sleepers properly. Axes, crowbars and shovels were all used to tamp down the ballast. \n \n Laying railway sleepers is slow, laborious work. The sleepers must be firmly imbedded in the earth so that the rails press evenly on each of them. \n Only one man in the group knew the technique of laying sleepers. That was Talya\u0027s father, the line foreman Lagutin, a man of 54 with a pitch-black beard parted in the middle and not a grey hair in his head. He had worked at Boyarka since the beginning of the job, sharing all the hardships with the younger men and had earned the respect of the whole detachment. Although he was not a Party member, Lagutin invariably held a place of honour at all Party conferences. He was very proud of this and had given his word not to leave until the job was finished. \n \"How can I leave you to carry on by yourselves? Something\u0027s bound to go wrong without an experienced man to keep an eye on things. When it comes to that, I\u0027ve hammered in more of these here sleepers up and down the country in my time than I can remember,\" he would say goodhumouredly each time the question of replacements came up. And so he stayed. \n Patoshkin saw that Lagutin knew his job and rarely inspected his sector. When Tokarev with Akim and Zhukhrai came over to where they were working, Pankratov, flushed and perspiring with exertion, was hewing out a hollow for a sleeper. Akim hardly recognised the young stevedore. Pankratov had lost much weight, his broad cheekbones protruded sharply in his grimy face which was sallow and sunken. \n \"Well, well,\" he said as he gave Akim a hot, damp hand, \"the big chiefs have come!\" \n The ringing of spades ceased. Akim surveyed the pale worn faces of the men around him. Their coats and jackets lay in a careless heap on the snow. \n After a brief talk with Lagutin, Tokarev took the party to the excavation site, inviting Pankratov to join them. The stevedore walked alongside Zhukhrai. \n \"Tell me, Pankratov, what happened at Motovilovka? Don\u0027t you think you overdid it disarming that Cheka man?\" Fyodor asked the taciturn stevedore sternly. \n Pankratov grinned sheepishly. \n \"It was all done by mutual consent,\" he explained. \"He asked us to disarm him. He\u0027s a good lad. \n When we explained what it was all about, he says: \u0027I see your difficulty, boys, but I haven\u0027t the right to let you take those windows and doors away. We have orders from Comrade Dzerzhinsky to put a stop to the plunder of railway property. The station master here has his knife in me. He\u0027s stealing stuff, the bastard, and I\u0027m in his way. If I let you get away with it he\u0027s bound to report me and I\u0027ll be tried by the Revolutionary Tribunal. But you can disarm me and clear off. And if the station master doesn\u0027t report the matter that will be the end of it.\u0027 So that\u0027s what we did. After all, we weren\u0027t taking those doors and windows for ourselves, were we?\" \n Noting the twinkle in Zhukhrai\u0027s eye, he went on: \"You can punish us for it if you want to, but don\u0027t be hard on that lad, Comrade Zhukhrai.\" \n \"That\u0027s all over and done with. But see there\u0027s no more of that in the future, it\u0027s bad for discipline. \n We are strong enough now to smash bureaucracy in an organised way. Now let\u0027s talk about something more important.\" And Fyodor proceeded to inquire about the details of the bandit raid. \n \n About four and a half kilometres from Boyarka station a group of men were digging furiously into a rise in the ground that stood in the path of the line. Seven men armed with all the weapons the detachment possessed — Kholyava\u0027s rifle and the revolvers belonging to Korchagin, Pankratov, Dubava and Khomutov — stood on guard. \n Patoshkin was sitting on top of the rise jotting down figures in his notebook. He was the only engineer on the job. Vakulenko, the technician, preferring to stand trial for desertion rather than death at a bandit\u0027s hand, had fled that morning. \n \"It will take two weeks to clear this hill out of the way. The ground\u0027s frozen hard,\" Patoshkin remarked in a low voice to the gloomy Khomutov standing beside him. \n \"We\u0027ve been given twenty-five days to finish the whole line, and you\u0027re figuring fifteen for this,\" \n Khomutov growled, chewing the tip of his moustache. \n \"Can\u0027t be done, I\u0027m afraid. Of course, I\u0027ve never built anything before under such conditions and with workers like these. I may be mistaken. As a matter of fact I have been mistaken twice before.\" \n At that moment Zhukhrai, Akim and Pankratov were seen approaching the slope. \n \"Look, who\u0027s that down there?\" cried Pyotr Trofimov, a young mechanic from the railway workshops in an old sweater torn at the elbows. He nudged Korchagin and pointed to the newcomers. The next moment Korchagin, spade in hands, was dashing down the hill. His eyes under the peak of his helmet smiled a warm greeting and Fyodor lingered over their handshake. \n \"Hallo there, Pavel! Hardly recognised you in this rig-out.\" \n Pankratov laughed drily: \"Rig-out isn\u0027t the word for it. Plenty of ventilation holes anyway. The deserters pinched his overcoat, Okunev gave him that jacket — they\u0027ve got a commune, you know. But Pavel\u0027s all right, he\u0027s got warm blood in his veins. He\u0027ll warm himself for a week or two more on the concrete floor — the straw doesn\u0027t make much difference — and then he\u0027ll be ready for a nice pine-wood coffin,\" the stevedore wound up with grim humour. \n Dark-browed, snub-nosed Okunev narrowed his mischievous eyes and objected: \"Never mind,we\u0027ll take care of Pavel. We can vote him a job in the kitchen helping Odarka. If he isn\u0027t a fool he can get himself a bit of extra grub and snuggle up to the stove or to Odarka herself.\" \n A roar of laughter met this remark; it was the first time they had laughed that day. \n \n Fyodor inspected the rise, then drove out with Tokarev and Patoshkin by sled to the timber felling. \n When he returned, the men were still digging with dogged persistence into the hill. Fyodor noted the rapid movement of the spades, and the backs of the workers bent under the strain. Turning to Akim, he said in an undertone: \n \"No need of meetings. No agitation required here. You were right, Tokarev, when you said these lads are worth their weight in gold. This is where the steel is tempered.\" \n Zhukhrai gazed at the diggers with admiration and stern, yet tender pride. Some of them only a short time back had stood before him bristling with the steel of their bayonets. That was on the night before the insurrection. And now, moved by a single impulse, they were toiling in order that the steel arteries of the railway might reach out to the precious source of warmth and life. \n \n Politely but firmly Patoshkin showed Fyodor that it was impossible to dig through the rise in lessthan two weeks. Fyodor listened to his arguments with a preoccupied air, his mind clearly busywith some problem of its own. \n \n \n \"Stop all work on the cut and carry on farther up the line. We\u0027ll tackle that hill in a different way,\"he said finally. \n Down at the station he spent a long time at the telephone. Kholyava, on guard outside the door,heard Fyodor\u0027s hoarse bass from within. \n \"Ring up the chief of staff of the Military Area and tell him in my name to transfer Puzyrevsky\u0027s regiment to the railway job at once. The bandits must be cleared out of the area without delay. \n Send an armoured train over with demolition men. I\u0027ll take care of the rest myself. I\u0027ll be back late. \n Tell Litke to be at the station with the car by midnight.\" \n In the barracks, after a short speech by Akim, Zhukhrai took the floor and an hour fled by in comradely discussion. Fyodor told the men there could be no question of extending the January 1 time limit allotted for the completion of the job. \n \"From now on we are putting the work on a military footing,\" he said. \"The Party members will form a special task company with Comrade Dubava in command. All six work teams will receive definite assignments. The remainder of the job will be divided into six equal sectors, one for each team. By January 1 all the work must be completed. The team that finishes first will be allowed to go back to town. Also, the Presidium of the Gubernia Executive Committee is asking the Government to award the Order of the Red Banner to the best worker in the team that comes out first.\" \n The leaders of the various teams were appointed as follows: No. 1, Comrade Pankratov, No. 2,Comrade Dubava, No. 3, Comrade Khomutov, No. 4, Comrade Lagutin, No. 5, Comrade \n Korchagin, No. 6, Comrade Okunev. \n \"The chief of the job, its political and administrative leader will, as before, be Anton Nikiforovich Tokarev,\" Zhukhrai wound up with an oratorical flourish. \n Like a flock of birds suddenly taking wing, the hand-clapping burst forth and stern faces relaxed in smiles. The warm whimsical conclusion to the speech relieved the strained attention of the meeting in a gust of laughter. \n Some twenty men trooped down to the station to see Akim and Fyodor off. \n As he shook hands with Korchagin, Fyodor glanced down at Pavel\u0027s snow-filled galosh. \n \"I\u0027ll send you a pair of boots,\" he said in a low voice. \"You haven\u0027t frozen your feet yet, I hope?\" \n \"They\u0027ve begun to swell a bit,\" Pavel replied, then remembering something he had asked for a long time ago, he caught Fyodor by the arm. \"Could you let me have a few cartridges for my revolver? I believe I only have three good ones left.\" \n Zhukhrai shook his head in regret, but catching Pavel\u0027s disappointed look, he quickly unstrapped his own Mauser. \"Here\u0027s a present for you.\" \n Pavel could not believe at first that he was really getting something he had set his heart on for so long, but Zhukhrai threw the leather strap over his shoulder saying: \"Take it, take it! I know you\u0027ve had your eye on it for a long time. But take care you don\u0027t shoot any of our own men with it. Here are three full clips to go with it.\" Pavel felt the envious eyes of the others upon him. \"Hey, Pavka,\" someone yelled, \"I\u0027ll swap with you for a pair of boots and a sheepskin thrown in.\" \n Pankratov nudged Pavel provokingly in the back. \n \"Come on, I\u0027ll give you a pair of felt boots for it. Anyway you\u0027ll be dead before Christmas with that galosh of yours.\" \n With one foot on the step of the trolley for support, Zhukhrai wrote out a permit for the Mauser. \n \n Early the next morning an armoured train clattered over the switches and pulled up at the station. \n The engine spouted plumes of steam as white as swansdown that vanished in the crystal-clear frosty air. Leather-clad figures emerged from the steel cars. A few hours later three demolition men from the train had planted in the earth of the hill two large black pumpkin-like objects with long fuses attached. They fired a few warning shots and the men scattered in all directions away from the now deadly hill. A match was put to the end of the fuse which flared up with a tiny phosphorescent flame. \n For a while the men held their breath. One or two moments of suspense, and then the earth trembled, and a terrific force rent the hill asunder, tossing huge chunks of earth skywards. The second explosion was more powerful than the first. The thunder of it reverberated over the surrounding forest, filling it with a confusion of sound. \n When the smoke and dust cleared a deep pit yawned where the hill had just stood, and the sugary snow was sprinkled with earth for dozens of paces all around. \n Men with picks and shovels rushed to the cavity formed by the explosion. \n \n After Zhukhrai\u0027s departure, a stubborn contest for the honour of being the first to finish the job commenced among the teams. \n Long before dawn Korchagin rose quietly, taking care not to wake the others, and stepping cautiously on numb feet over the chilly floor made his way to the kitchen. There he heated the water for tea and went back to wake up his team. \n By the time the others were up it was broad daylight. That morning Pankratov elbowed his way through the crowded barracks to where Dubava and his group were having their breakfast. \n \"Hear that, Mityai?\" he said heatedly. \"Pavka went and got his lads up before daylight. I bet they\u0027ve got a good twenty yards laid out by now. The fellows say he\u0027s got those railway repair shop boys all worked up to finish their section by the twenty-fifth. Wants to beat the rest of us hollow. But I say nothing doing!\" \n Dubava gave a sour smile. He could understand why the secretary of the river-port Komsomol had been touched on the raw by what the railway repair shopmen had done. As a matter of fact his friend Pavel had stolen a march on him, Dubava, as well. Without saying a word to anyone he had simply challenged the whole company. \n \"Friends or no friends, it\u0027s the best man who wins,\" Pankratov said. \n Around midday Korchagin\u0027s team was hard at work when an unexpected interruption occurred. \n The sentry standing guard over the rifles caught sight of a group of horsemen approaching through the trees and fired a warning shot. \n \"To arms, lads! Bandits!\" cried Pavel. He flung down his spade and rushed over to the tree where his Mauser hung. \n Snatching their rifles the others dropped down straight in the snow by the edge of the line. The leading horsemen waved their caps. \n \"Steady there, Comrades, don\u0027t shoot!\" one of them shouted. \n \n Some fifty cavalrymen in Budyonny caps with bright red stars came riding up the road. \n A unit of Puzyrevsky\u0027s regiment had come on a visit to the job. Pavel noticed that the commander\u0027s horse, a handsome grey mare with a white blaze on her forehead, had the tip of one ear missing. She pranced restlessly under her rider, and when Pavel rushed forward and seized her by the bridle, she shied away nervously. \n \"Why, Lyska old girl, I never thought we\u0027d meet again! So the bullets didn\u0027t get you, my one-eared beauty.\" \n He embraced her slender neck tenderly and stroked her quivering nostrils. \n The commander stared at Pavel for a moment, then cried out in amazement: \"Well, if it isn\u0027t Korchagin! You recognise the mare but you don\u0027t see your old pal Sereda. Greetings, lad!\" \n \n In the meantime back in town pressure was being exerted in all quarters to expedite the building of the line, and this was felt at once at the job. Zharky had literally stripped the Komsomol District Committee of all the male personnel and sent them out to Boyarka. Only the girls were left at Solomenka. He got the railway school to send out another batch of students. \n \"I\u0027m left here with the female proletariat,\" he joked, reporting the results of his work to Akim. \"I think I\u0027ll put Talya Lagutina in my place, hang out the sign \u0027Women\u0027s Department\u0027 on the door and clear out to Boyarka myself. It\u0027s awkward for me here, the only man among all these women. You ought to see the nasty looks they give me. I\u0027m sure they\u0027re saying: \u0027Look, the sly beggar sent everybody off, but stays on himself.\u0027 Or something worse still. You must let me go.\" \n But Akim merely laughed at his words. \n \n New workers continued to arrive at Boyarka, among them sixty students from the railway school. \n Zhukhrai induced the railway administration to send four passenger carriages to Boyarka to house the newcomers. \n Dubava\u0027s team was released from work and sent to Pushcha-Voditsa to bring back the engines and sixty-five narrow-gauge flatcars. This assignment was to be counted as part of the work on their section. \n Before leaving, Dubava advised Tokarev to recall Klavicek from town and put him in charge of one of the newly-organised work teams at Boyarka. Tokarev did so. He did not know the real reason for Dubava\u0027s request: a note from Anna which the newcomers from Solomenka had brought. \n \n \"Dmitri!\" Anna wrote. \"Klavicek and I have prepared a pile of books for you. We send our warmest greetings to you and all the other Boyarka shock workers. You are all wonderful! We wish you strength and energy to carry on. Yesterday the last stocks of wood were distributed. \n Klavicek asks me to send you his greetings. He is wonderful. He bakes all the bread for Boyarka,sifts the flour and kneads the dough high himself. He doesn\u0027t trust anyone in the bakery to do it. \n He managed to get excellent flour and his bread is good, much better than the kind I get. In the evenings our friends gather in my place — Lagutina, Artyukhin, Klavicek, and sometimes Zharky. We do a bit of reading but mostly we talk about everybody and everything, chiefly about you in Boyarka. The girls are furious with Tokarev for refusing to let them work on the railway. They say they can endure hardships as well as anyone. Talya declares she\u0027s going to dress up in her father\u0027s \n clothes and go out to Boyarka by herself. \u0027Let him just try to kick me out,\u0027 she says. \n \"I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if she kept her word. Please give my regards to your dark-eyed friend. \n \"Anna.\" \n \n The blizzard came upon them suddenly. Low grey clouds spread themselves over the sky and the snow fell thickly. When night came the wind howled in the chimneys and moaned in the trees, \n chasing the whirling snow-flakes and awakening the forest echoes with its malevolent whine. \n All night long the storm raged in a wild fury, and although the stoves were kept warm throughout the night the men shivered; the wrecked station building could not hold the warmth. \n In the morning they had to plough through the deep snow to reach their sections. High above the trees the sun shone in a blue sky without a single cloudlet to mar its clear expanse. \n Korchagin and his men went to work to clear the snowdrifts from their section. Only now did Pavel realise how much a man could suffer from the cold. Okunev\u0027s threadbare jacket gave him scant protection and his galosh was constantly full of snow. He kept losing it in the snow, and now his other boot was threatening to fall apart. Two enormous boils had broken out on his neck — the result of sleeping on the cold floor. Tokarev had given him his towel to wear in place of a scarf. \n Gaunt and red-eyed, Pavel was furiously plying his wooden snow shovel when a passenger train puffed slowly into the station. Its expiring engine had barely managed to haul it this far; there was not a single log of wood in the tender and the last embers were burning low in the firebox. \n \"Give us fuel and we\u0027ll go on, or else shunt us onto a siding while we still have the power to move!\" the engine driver yelled to the station master. \n The train was switched onto a siding. The reason for the halt was explained to the disgruntled passengers and a storm of complaints and curses broke out in the crowded carriages. \n \"Go and talk to that old chap,\" the station master advised the train guards, pointing to Tokarev who was walking down the platform. \n \"He\u0027s the chief of the job here. Maybe he can get wood brought down by sled to the engine. \n They\u0027re using the logs for sleepers.\" \n \"I\u0027ll give you the wood, but you\u0027ll have to work for it,\" said Tokarev when\" the conductors applied to him. \"After all, it\u0027s our building material. We\u0027re being held up at the moment by the snow. \n There must be about six or seven hundred passengers inside your train. The women and children can stay inside but let the men come and lend a hand clearing the snow until evening and I\u0027ll give you firewood. If they refuse they can stay where they are till New Year\u0027s.\" \n \n \"Look at the crowd coming this way! Look, women too!\" Korchagin heard a surprised \n exclamation at his back. He turned round. Tokarev came up. \n \"Here are a hundred helpers for you,\" he said. \"Give them work and see none of them is idle.\" \n Korchagin put the newcomers to work. One tall man in a smart railway uniform with a fur collar and a warm caracul cap indignantly twirled the shovel in his hands and turned to his companion, a young woman wearing a sealskin hat with a fluffy pompon on top. \n \"I am not going to shovel snow and nobody has the right to force me to do it. As a railway engineer I could take charge of the work if they ask me to, but neither you nor I need to shovel snow. It\u0027s contrary to the regulations. That old man is breaking the law. I can have him prosecuted. \n Where is your foreman?\" he demanded of the worker nearest him. \n Korchagin came over. \n \"Why aren\u0027t you working?\" \n The man examined Pavel contemptuously from head to foot. \n \"And who may you be?\" \n \"I am a worker.\" \n \"Then I have nothing to say to you. Send me your foreman, or whatever you call him....\" \n Korchagin scowled. \n \"You needn\u0027t work if you don\u0027t want to. But you won\u0027t get back on that train unless your ticket is countersigned by us. That\u0027s the construction chief\u0027s orders.\" \n \"What about you?\" Pavel turned to the woman and was struck dumb with surprise. Before him stood Tonya Tumanova! \n Tonya could hardly believe that this tramp who stood before her in his tattered clothing and incredible footwear, with a filthy towel around his neck and a face that had not been washed for many a day, was the Korchagin she once knew. Only his eyes blazed as fiercely as ever. The eyes of the Pavel she remembered. And to think that only a short while ago she had given her love to this ragged creature. How everything had changed! \n She had recently married, and she and her husband were on their way to the city where he held an important position in the railway administration. Who could have thought that she would meet the object of her girlish affections in this way? She even hesitated to give him her hand. What would Vasili think? How awful of Korchagin to have fallen so low. Evidently the young stoker had not been able to rise above navvy work. \n She stood hesitating, her cheeks burning. Meanwhile the railway engineer, infuriated by what he considered the insolence of this tramp who stood staring at his wife, flung down his shovel and went over to her side. \n \"Let us go, Tonya, I can\u0027t stand the sight of this lazzarone.\" \n Korchagin had read Giuseppe Garibaldi and he knew what that word meant. \n \"I may be a lazzarone, but you\u0027re no more than a rotten bourgeois,\" he said hoarsely, and turning to Tonya, added curtly: \"Take a shovel, Comrade Tumanova, and get into line. Don\u0027t take an example from this prize bull here. . .. Excuse me if he is any relation of yours.\" \n Pavel glanced at Tonya\u0027s fur boots and smiled grimly, adding casually: \n \"I wouldn\u0027t advise you to stop over here. The other night we were attacked by bandits.\" \n With that he turned on his heel and walked off, his galosh flapping as he went. \n His last words impressed the railway engineer, and Tonya succeeded in persuading him to stay and work. \n That evening, when the day\u0027s work was over, the crowd streamed back to the station. Tonya\u0027s husband hurried ahead to make sure of a seat in the train. Tonya, stopping to let a group of workers pass, saw Pavel trudging wearily behind the others, leaning heavily on his shovel. \n \"Hello, Pavlusha,\" she said and fell into step beside him. \"I must say I never expected to find you in such straits. Surely the authorities ought to know you deserve something better than navvy\u0027s work? I thought you\u0027d be a commissar or something like that by now. What a pity life has been so unkind to you....\" \n Pavel halted and surveyed Tonya with surprise. \n \"Nor did I expect to find you ... so stuffy,\" he said, choosing the most polite word he could think of to express his feelings. \n The tips of Tonya\u0027s ears burned. \n \"You\u0027re just as rude as ever!\" \n Korchagin hoisted his shovel onto his shoulder and strode off. After a few steps he stopped. \n \"My rudeness, Comrade Tumanova,\" he said, \"is not half as offensive as your so-called politeness. \n And as for my life, please don\u0027t worry about that. There\u0027s nothing wrong with it. It\u0027s your life that\u0027s all wrong, ever so much worse than I expected. Two years ago you were better, you wouldn\u0027t have been ashamed to shake hands with a workingman. But now you reek of moth balls. To tell the truth, you and I have nothing more to say to each other.\" \n \n Pavel had a letter from Artem announcing that he was going to be married and urging Pavel to come to the wedding without fail. \n The wind tore the sheet of paper out of Pavel\u0027s hand and it flew off into the air. No wedding parties for him. How could he leave now? Only yesterday that bear Pankratov had outstripped his team and spurted forward at a pace that amazed everyone. The stevedore was making a desperate bid for first place in the contest. His usual nonchalance had forsaken him and he was whipping up his \"water-fronters\" to a furious tempo. \n Patoshkin, noting the silent intensity with which the men worked, scratched his head perplexedly. \n \"Are these men or giants?\" he marvelled. \"Where do they get their incredible strength? If the weather holds out for only eight more days we\u0027ll reach the timber! Well, live and learn! These men are breaking all records and estimates.\" Klavicek came from town bringing the last batch of bread he had baked. He had a talk with Tokarev and then went off to hunt for Korchagin. The two men shook hands warmly. Klavicek with a broad smile dived into his knapsack and produced a handsome fur-lined leather jacket of Swedish make. \n \"This is for you!\" he said stroking the soft leather. \"Guess from whom? What! You don\u0027t know? \n You are dense, man! It\u0027s from Comrade Ustinovich. So you shouldn\u0027t catch cold. Olshinsky gave it to her. She took it from him and handed it straight to me with orders to take it to you. Akim told her you\u0027ve been going about in the frost with nothing but a thin jacket. Olshinsky\u0027s nose was put out of joint a bit. \u0027I can send the comrade an army coat,\u0027 he says. But Rita only laughed. \u0027Never mind,\u0027 she said, \u0027he\u0027ll work better in this jacket.\u0027 \" \n The astonished Pavel took the luxurious-looking jacket and after some hesitation slipped it on. Almost at once he felt the warmth from the soft fur spreading over his shoulders and chest. \n \n \n Rita wrote in her diary: \n \n December 20 \n \n \n \"We have been having a bout of blizzards. Snow and wind. Out at Boyarka they had almost reached their goal when the frosts and storms halted them. They are up to their necks in snow and the frozen earth is not easy to dig. They have only three-quarters of a kilometre to go, but this is the hardest lap of all. \n \"Tokarev reports an outbreak of typhoid fever. Three men are down with it.\" \n \n December 22 \n \n \"There was a plenary session of the Komsomol Guber-nia Committee but no one from Boyarka attended. Bandits derailed a trainload of grain seventeen kilometres from Boyarka, and the Food Commissariat representative ordered all the construction workers to be sent to the spot.\" \n \n December 23 \n \n \"Another seven typhoid cases have been brought to town from Boyarka. Okunev is one of them. I went down to the station and saw frozen corpses of people who had been riding the buffers taken off a Kharkov train. The hospitals are unheated. This accursed blizzard, when will it end?\" \n \n December 24 \n \n \"Just seen Zhukhrai. He confirmed the rumour that Orlik and his band attacked Boyarka last night. The fight lasted two hours. Communications were cut and Zhukhrai did not get the exact report until this morning. The band was beaten back but Tokarev has been wounded, a bullet went right through his chest. He will be brought to town today. Franz Klavicek, who was in charge of the guard that night, was killed. He was the one who spotted the band and raised the alarm. He started shooting at the raiders but they were on him before he had time to reach the school building. He was cut down by a sabre blow. Eleven of the builders were wounded. Two cavalry squadrons and an armoured train are there by now. \n \"Pankratov has taken charge of the job. Today Puzyrevsky caught up with part of the band in Gluboky village and wiped it out. Some of the non-Party workers started out for town without waiting for a train; they are walking along the track.\" \n \n December 25 \n \n \"Tokarev and the other wounded men arrived, and were placed in hospital. The doctors promised to save the old man. He is still unconscious. The lives of the others are not in danger. \n \"A telegram came from Boyarka addressed to us and the Gubernia Party Committee. \u0027In reply to the bandit assault, we builders of the narrow-gauge line gathered at this meeting together with the crew of the armoured train For Soviet Power and the Red Army men of the cavalry regiment, vow to you that notwithstanding all obstacles the town shall have firewood by January 1. Mustering all our strength we are setting to work. Long live the Communist Party, which sent us here! \n Korchagin, chairman of the meeting. Berzin, secretary.\u0027 \n \"Klavicek was buried with military honours at Solomenka.\" \n \n The cherished goal was in sight, but the advance toward it was agonisingly slow, for every day typhoid fever tore dozens of badly needed hands from the builders\u0027 ranks. \n One day Korchagin, returning from work to the station, staggered along like a drunkard, his legs ready to give way beneath him. He had been feverish for quite some time, but today it gripped him more fiercely than usual. \n Typhoid fever, which had thinned the ranks of the building detachment, had claimed a new victim. \n But Pavel\u0027s sturdy constitution resisted the disease and for five days in succession he had found the strength to pick himself up from his straw pallet on the concrete floor and join the others at work. But the fever had taken possession of him and now neither the warm jacket nor the felt boots, Fyodor\u0027s gift, worn over his already frostbitten feet, helped. \n A sharp pain seared his chest with each step he took, his teeth chattered, and his vision was blurred so that the trees seemed to be whirling around in a strange merry-go-round. \n With difficulty he dragged himself to the station. An unusual commotion there caused him to halt,and straining his fever-hazed eyes, he saw a long train of flatcars stretching the entire length of the platform. Men who had come with the train were busy unloading narrow-gauge engines, rails and leepers. Pavel staggered forward and lost his balance. He felt a dull pain as his head hit the ground and the pleasant coolness of the snow against his burning cheek. \n Several hours later he was found and carried back to the barracks. He was breathing heavily, quite unconscious of his surroundings. A doctor\u0027s assistant summoned from the armoured train examined him and diagnosed pneumonia and typhoid fever. His temperature was over 106°. The doctor\u0027s assistant noted the inflammation of the joints and the ulcers on the neck but said they were trifles compared with the pneumonia and typhoid which alone were enough to kill him. \n Pankratov and Dubava, who had arrived from town, did all they could to save Pavel. \n Alyosha Kokhansky, who came from the same town as Pavel, was entrusted with taking him home to his people. \n With the help of all the members of Korchagin\u0027s team, and mainly with Kholyava acting as battering ram, Pankratov and Dubava managed to get Alyosha and the unconscious Korchagin into the packed railway carriage. The passengers, suspecting typhus, resisted violently and threatened to throw the sick man out of the train en route. \n Kholyava waved his gun under their noses and roared: \"His illness is not infectious! And he\u0027s going on this train even if we have to throw out the whole lot of you! And remember, you swine,if anyone lays a finger on him, I\u0027ll send word down the line and you\u0027ll all be taken off the train and put behind the bars. Here, Alyosha, take Pavel\u0027s Mauser and shoot the first man who tries to put him off,\" Kholyava wound up for additional emphasis. \n The train puffed out of the station. Pankratov went over to Dubava standing on the deserted platform. \n \"Do you think he\u0027ll pull through?\" \n The question remained unanswered. \n \n \"Come along, Mityai, it can\u0027t be helped. We\u0027ve got to answer for everything now. We must get those engines unloaded during the night and in the morning we\u0027ll try to start them going.\" \n Kholyava telephoned to all his Cheka friends along the line urging them to make sure that the sick Korchagin was not taken off the train anywhere. Not until he had been given a firm assurance that this would be done did he finally go to bed. \n \n At a railway junction farther down the line the body of an unknown fair-haired young man was carried out of one of the carriages of a passenger train passing through and set down on the platform. Who he was and what he had died of no one knew. The station Cheka men, remembering Kholyava\u0027s request, ran over to the carriage, but when they saw that the youth was dead, gave instructions for the corpse to be removed to the morgue, and immediately telephoned to Kholyava at Boyarka informing him of the death of his friend whose life he had been so anxious to save. \n A brief telegram was sent from Boyarka to the Gubernia Committee of the Komsomol announcing Korchagin\u0027s death. \n In the meantime, however, Alyosha Kokhansky delivered the sick Korchagin to his people and came down himself with the fever. \n \n January 9 \n \n \"Why does my heart ache so? Before I sat down to write I wept bitterly. Who would have believed that Rita could weep and with such anguish? But are tears always a sign of weakness? Today mine are tears of searing grief. Why did grief come on this day of victory when the horrors of cold have been overcome, when the railway stations are piled high with precious fuel, when I have just returned from the celebration of the victory, an enlarged plenary meeting of the Town Soviet where the heroes of the railway job were accorded all honours. This is victory, but two men lost their lives — Klavicek and Korchagin. \n \"Pavel\u0027s death has opened my eyes to the truth — he was far dearer to me than I had thought. \n \"And now I shall close this diary. I doubt whether I shall ever return to it. Tomorrow I am writing to Kharkov to accept the job offered me in the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Komsomol.\" \n \n 朱赫来一边思考，一边从嘴里取下烟斗，小心地用指头按了按隆起的烟灰。烟斗已经灭了。 \n \n 屋子里十几个人在吸烟，灰色的烟雾宛如浮云，在天花板上的毛玻璃灯罩下面，在省委书记坐椅的上方缭绕。围着桌子坐在办公室角落里的人，看上去就像罩在薄雾中。 \n \n 胸口贴着桌子，坐在省委书记旁边的是托卡列夫老头。他气愤地捻着小胡子，偶尔斜眼瞅一下那个秃顶的矮个子，这家伙嗓子又尖又细，一直在罗里罗嗦地兜圈子，说些像鸡蛋壳一样空洞的废话。 \n \n 阿基姆看见了这个老钳工斜视的目光，这目光使他回想起童年——那时候他们家里有一只爱斗的公鸡，叫“专啄眼”。每当它准备进攻的时候，也是这样斜眼打量对手的。 \n \n 省党委的会议已经开了一个多小时。秃头是铁路林业委员会的主席。 \n \n 他一边用敏捷的手指翻动文件，一边滔滔不绝地说：“……正是因为有这些客观原因，省委和铁路管理局的决议才无法实现。我再说一遍，就是再过一个月，我们能够提供的木柴也不会超过四百立方米。至于完成十八万立方米的任务，那简直是……”秃头在挑选字眼，“乌托邦！”说完，小嘴巴一撇，露出一副抱屈的神情。 \n \n 接着是一阵沉默，仿佛持续了很久。 \n \n 朱赫来用指甲敲着烟斗，想把烟灰磕出来。托卡列夫说话了，他那低沉的喉音打破了沉默：“这没什么好磨嘴皮子的。你的意思是说：铁路林业委员会过去没有木柴，现在没有，将来也不会有……是这样吗？” \n \n 秃头耸了耸肩膀。 \n \n “很抱歉，同志，木柴我们早就准备好了，只是没有马车往外运……”小矮个子哽住了。他用方格手绢擦了擦光秃秃的脑袋，擦完之后，好久也找不到衣袋，就焦躁地把手绢塞到皮包底下去了。 \n \n “您都采取了些什么措施运送木柴呢？原来领导这项工作的那些专家搞了鬼，可是他们给抓起来好些日子了。”坐在角落里的杰涅科说。 \n \n 秃头朝他转过身来，说：“我已经向铁路管理局打了三次报告，说没有运输工具就不可能……” \n \n 托卡列夫打断了他的话：“这我们早就听说了，”老钳工轻蔑地哼了一声，狠狠地瞪了秃头一眼。“拿我们当傻瓜还是怎么的？” \n \n 这一问，吓得秃头起了一身鸡皮疙瘩。 \n \n “对反革命分子的活动，我可不能负责。”秃头回答的声音已经低了下来。 \n \n “但是，他们在离铁路很远的地方伐木，这事您知道吧？” \n \n 阿基姆问。 \n \n “听说过，不过这种不正常的现象是别人辖区里的事，我是不能向上级报告的。” \n \n “您手下有多少工作人员？”工会理事会主席向秃头提了一个问题。 \n \n “大约二百人。” \n \n “这帮饭桶每人一年只砍一立方米！”托卡列夫冒火了，使劲啐了一口。 \n \n “铁路林业委员会全体人员都领头等口粮，我们让城里的工人把口粮节约下来给你们，可你们干了些什么呢？我们拨给工人的那两车皮面粉，你们弄到哪儿去了？”工会理事会主席继续追问。 \n \n 四面八方都向秃头提出各种各样尖锐的问题，可是他对这些问题却一味支吾搪塞，就像对付逼债的债主一样。 \n \n 这家伙滑得像条泥鳅，根本不正面回答问题，两只眼睛却不停地东张西望。他本能地感觉到危险逼近了。他又心虚，又紧张，现在他只有一个愿望——赶快离开这里回家，家里已经准备好了丰盛的晚餐，他那风韵犹存的妻子正在读保罗·德·科克［保罗·德·科克（１７９４—１８７１），法国作家。——译者］的小说消遣，等他回去吃晚饭。 \n \n 朱赫来一面注意听秃头的回答，一面在笔记本上写道：“我认为，应当对这个人做更深入的审查，他不是工作能力低的问题。我已经掌握了他的一些材料……不必再同他谈下去，让他滚开，咱们好干正事。” \n \n 省委书记读完接到的纸条，向朱赫来点了点头。 \n \n 朱赫来站起来，走到外屋去打电话。他回来的时候，省委书记已经念到决议的结尾：“……鉴于铁路林业委员会领导人公然消极怠工，故撤销其职务，并将此案交侦查机关审理。” \n \n 秃头本来以为不会这么便宜他。不错，指责他消极怠工，撤了他的职，说明对他是不是可靠产生了怀疑，不过，这终究是小事一桩。至于博亚尔卡的事情，他是不用担心的，又不是他辖区里的事。“呸，真见鬼，我还以为他们摸到我的什么底了呢……” \n \n 他差不多完全放下心来了，一边往皮包里收拾文件，一边说：“也好，反正我是一个非党专家，你们有权不信任我。但是我问心无愧。要是有什么工作我没有做到，那只是因为力不从心。” \n \n 谁也没有答理他。秃头走出房间，急急忙忙跑下楼梯，轻松地舒了一口气，拉开了临街的大门。就在门口，一个穿军大衣的人问他：“公民，您贵姓？” \n \n 秃头吓得心都要蹦出来了，结结巴巴地说：“切尔……温斯基……” \n \n 在省委书记的办公室里，那个“外人”走出去之后，十三个人全把脑袋紧紧地凑到大桌子上面来了。 \n \n “你们看……”朱赫来用手指按着摊开的地图说。“这是博亚尔卡站，离车站七俄里是伐木场。这儿堆积着二十一万立方米木柴。一支劳动大军在这儿干了八个月，付出了巨大的劳动，结果呢——咱们被出卖了，铁路和城市还是得不到燃料。木柴要从六俄里以外的地方运到车站来。这就至少需要五千辆大车，整整运一个月，而且每天要运两趟。最近的一个村庄在十五俄里以外，而且奥尔利克匪帮就在这一带活动……这是什么意思，你们明白了吧？……再看，按照计划，伐木应该从这儿开始，然后向车站方向推进，可是这帮坏蛋反而把伐木队往森林里引。他们的算盘打得倒挺如意：这样一来，咱们就不能把伐倒的木头运到铁路沿线。事实上也是这样，咱们连一百辆大车也弄不到。他们就是这样整咱们的！……这一招跟搞暴动没有什么两样。” \n \n 朱赫来紧握着的拳头沉重地落在打了蜡的地图上。 \n \n 对于日益逼近的威胁，朱赫来虽然没有明说，但是在座的十三个人心里都十分清楚。冬天已经到了大门口。医院、学校、机关和几十万居民都只能听任严寒的摆布。车站挤满了人，像一窝蚂蚁，而火车却只能每星期开一次。 \n \n 每个人都陷入了沉思。 \n \n 朱赫来松开了拳头，说：“同志们，只有一条出路，就是在三个月的期限内，从车站到伐木场修一条轻便铁路，全长是七俄里。争取在一个半月之内，就把铁路修到伐木场的边缘。这件事我已经研究了一个星期。要完成这项工程，”朱赫来焦干的嗓子变得沙哑了。 \n \n “需要三百五十个工人和两个工程师。普夏—沃季察有现成的铁轨和七个火车头，是共青团员们在那儿的仓库里找到的。战前想从那儿铺一条轻便铁路到城里来。不过，工人们在博亚尔卡没有地方住。当地只有一所破房子，过去是林业学校。工人只好分批派去，两个星期轮换一次，时间长了受不了。阿基姆，咱们把共青团员调上去，怎么样？” \n \n 他没有等回答，接着说：“共青团要把能派出的人都派去，首先是索洛缅卡区的团员和城里的一部分团员。任务十分艰巨，但是只要跟同志们讲清楚，只有这样才能拯救全城和铁路，他们一定会完成任务的。” \n \n 铁路局长怀疑地摇了摇头。 \n \n “这么干不见得会有什么结果吧。在这么荒凉的地方铺七俄里长的铁路，又赶上现在是秋天，雨水多，眼看就要上冻了。”他有气无力地说。 \n \n 朱赫来连头也没有回，不客气地说：“你要是早把伐木工作管好，就没这些事了，安德列·瓦西里耶维奇。铁路支线一定要建成。总不能抱着肩膀，干等着冻死。” \n \n 丽达的日记本里新写了满满两页纸： \n \n 组织人力去修轻便铁路的动员工作已经进行两天多了。 \n \n 索洛缅卡区的团组织几乎整个都派去。团省委委员去三个人——杜巴瓦、潘克拉托夫和柯察金，由此可见这项工程多么重要。这三个人是朱赫来同志亲自选中的。我和阿基姆曾两次去他那里，一起商量了好久。他说，这项工程极其艰苦，如果失败，那就要大难临头。后天有一列专车送工人到工地去。 \n \n 昨天召开了去工地的党团员会议，托卡列夫发表了精彩的演说。省党委把领导这项工程的重任托付给这位老人，这个人选太恰当了。总共有四百人要去，其中共青团员一百名，党员二十名，工程师和技术员各一名。今天扎尔基和柯察金到交通专科学校去动员学生。是的，是柯察金。要不是图夫塔吹毛求疵，挑起事端，我还真不知道他就是谢廖沙常常谈起的那个保尔。图夫塔因为挟嫌泄私愤，在常委会上受到申斥的处分。就是在常委会上，他也没有完全放弃指责保尔。事情发生在积极分子会议上。 \n \n 当时正在挑选去工地的人员。图夫塔突然对保尔的任命提出异议。他的理由让我们全都感到吃惊。图夫塔说，保尔同资产阶级分子有联系，加之过去参加过反对派，因此，不能让他担任小队的领导。 \n \n 我看着保尔。当图夫塔应大家的要求，提出证明，进行解释的时候，保尔的目光由惊奇变成了愤怒。图夫塔说的是：粉碎反革命阴谋那次，图夫塔和保尔编在同一个分队里，他们到一个教授家去搜查。这个教授的女儿原来是保尔的熟人。图夫塔偷听到她和保尔的谈话，她问保尔：“真的是您让人来搜查我家的吗，柯察金同志？要真是这样，对我便是一种莫大的侮辱。您对我们家好像是相当了解的。”保尔回答说，如果在你们家什么可疑的人都搜不出来，分队会离开的。图夫塔要求保尔说清楚，他跟资产阶级小姐怎么会这么亲近熟悉。 \n \n 保尔表现得不错。他控制住了自己的情绪，这在他是不容易的。他是这样回敬图夫塔的：“同志们，如果是你们当中任何一个别的人说我这种闲话，我是会很恼火的。现在是图夫塔说，那就是另一码事了。眼下大家都忙得不可开交，而这位同志不是和大家共同做好工作，却在那里乱咬人，这是为什么呢？只有天知道。朋友们，我当然是要解释清楚的，不过不是向他，而是向你们大家。事情很简单，一九二○年，我在这个教授家中寄住过一阵子，这就相互认识了呗。这家人没有做过什么坏事。至于我过去犯的政治错误，我一直牢记心间。没有一位同志再翻过老帐。图夫塔现在的做法是不正确的。等到了工地，我们会有机会来证明这一点的。” \n \n 保尔的话给打断了，大家不让他再说下去。图夫塔受到申斥的处分。我想在保尔去博亚尔卡之前同他见一次面。 \n \n 交通专科学校两层楼的大楼房里闹哄哄的一片，各年级的头头在召集学生开全体会议。有人拽了一下保尔的袖子。 \n \n “你好，保尔，哪阵风把你给吹来啦？”打招呼的是一个目光严肃的小伙子，他戴着学校的制帽，帽子底下耷拉下来一绺波浪形的鬈发。 \n \n 小伙子名叫阿廖沙·科汉斯基，与保尔同年，是保尔的同乡。阿廖沙的哥哥也在阿尔焦姆工作的机车库当钳工。科汉斯基一家辛辛苦苦，省吃俭用，供他读书。小伙子也不赖，一边劳动一边学习，读完了技工学校高级班，又到基辅来上学。阿廖沙长话短说，向保尔讲了讲他上学的经过和波折：“咱们城里来了六个人。这些人你大概都认识，有舒拉·苏哈里科、扎利瓦诺夫、沙拉蓬，就是那个小滑头，独眼龙，记得吧？还有萨什卡·切博塔里、万卡·尤林。他们几个，一路上吃的东西，家里全给准备得好好的，又是果酱，又是香肠，又是烙饼，七七八八一大堆。我呢，塞了一盒子黑面包干就上路，再也没有别的可带的。这几个中学生，一路上一个劲儿耍笑我。把我气得要命，恨不得狠狠揍这几个坏蛋一顿。别看他们有五个狗东西，我兴许要吃亏，可捞到一个我算够本。实在叫人受不了。听他们说的：‘龟孙子，你往哪儿钻哪？傻瓜，呆家里抠土豆去吧。’唉，算了。总算到了基辅。 \n \n 他们全都带着介绍信，去找这个长那个长。我一口气跑到军区参谋部。我想当飞行员。睡觉做梦我都能梦见在半空中打转转。” \n \n 保尔微微一笑，开玩笑地问阿廖沙：“地下就挤不下你了？” \n \n 阿廖沙也笑了笑，露出一口雪白的牙齿，说：“参谋部的人也这么说：‘你干吗非要穿云破雾呢？还是地下保险。’他们都取笑我。我连县团委的介绍信都带着呢，请他们帮助我进空军。我们家还住过一个搞军需供应的政委，叫安德列耶夫。他也在介绍信背面写了几句。一字不差，这么写的：‘本人认为科汉斯基同志有觉悟。总的说是个棒小伙子。脑袋瓜也挺灵。出身工人家庭。他想开飞机，那就让他去学嘛，可以支援世界革命嘛。’下面的签名是：‘第一三○博贡师军需队政委安德列耶夫’。” \n \n 保尔打心眼里乐开了。阿廖沙也哈哈大笑，引得一帮学生围拢过来。阿廖沙边笑边继续说：“是啊，飞行员的事没办成。参谋部里的人向我解释说，眼下没有飞机让我开。要是先学点技术，倒可以，飞机嘛，啥时候开都不晚。我就跑这里来了，递了申请书。结果呢，入学要考试。那五个家伙也在这里。考试两个礼拜之后进行。我一看——大事不妙。一个名额八个人争，来的还大多是城里人。有的找到教授先来一遍模拟考试，有的像我们这几位，都是中学七年级毕业。我赶紧翻书，恢复恢复记忆。还要去打工，卸一车皮木柴，够两天吃的。后来木柴没有卸的了，只好勒裤腰带。而我们那几位呢，成天忙着跑剧院，深更半夜才回宿舍。宿舍本来冷冷清清的，学生们差不多都去度暑假了。可只要这几个家伙一回来，就甭想再看书：叫啊，闹啊，笑啊。扎利瓦诺夫领他们去轻歌剧院，介绍他们认识了一些女演员。三天工夫，她们把他们口袋里的钱掏了个精光。等到没东西下肚了，这帮混蛋就来个顺手牵羊，牵走了一个外地考生的四十只鸡蛋，又趁我不在，一顿嚼光了我剩下的一点面包干。 \n \n “考试的一天终于到了。第一门考的是几何。发的试卷上都盖了图章，三十五分钟解习题。我看看黑板上的试题，全会做。再瞧瞧那几个中学生，一个个傻了眼，都在绞脑汁呢。 \n \n 愁眉苦脸，龇牙咧嘴的，又好像他们椅子上有人钉了几只尖木桩，坐也不是，不坐也不是。沙拉蓬那个汗哪，劈里啪啦往下掉。他那副傻瓜嘴脸，一只独眼溜东溜西的。我心里寻思，狗娘养的，这可不像你拧姑娘大腿那么容易。” \n \n 阿廖沙笑得喘不过气来，又接着说下去：“我解完了题，站起来，准备交给教授。苏哈里科和扎利瓦诺夫压低嗓门，老鼠似的吱吱叫唤：‘递张小抄过来。’“我径直朝桌子走去，路过切博塔里身旁。他在小声咒骂我，骂得可难听了。两天下来，他们各得了四个两分，退出了考试。我沉住气继续考。他们在干什么呢？有一次苏哈里科来找我，说：‘别在这里泡啦。我们私下里从老师那儿打听到，你有两个两分。反正考不取。跟我们一起报建筑专科学校吧，那里容易取。现在还来得及。’我差点信了他的话，不过并没有放弃考试。反正只剩下两门了，考完再说。结果呢，他们是糊弄我。我考取了，他们几个进了专科学校附设的二年制技校，这样就可以蒙骗家里人。入学没有要他们考试，因为技校只要求中学二年级的文化。他们领到了学生证、免票卡。如今哪条铁路线上都少不了他们。跑单帮，投机倒把，腰包塞得鼓鼓的。有了钱就大吃大喝。在城里已经搬了三次家。 \n \n 到哪儿都闹事，酗酒，让人家撵出来。尤林也尽量躲着他们，他进了建筑专科学校。” \n \n 走廊上越来越挤。人不断往大教室去。保尔和阿廖沙也往那里去。路上，阿廖沙又想起了什么，笑得喘不上气来，说：“前不久尤林顺路去看他们。他们在赌牌。尤林也凑热闹，没想到赢了。你猜怎么着？他们把他的钱抢过去，还狠揍了一顿，又赶出了门。这真叫活该。” \n \n 宽敞的大教室里，会议一直开到半夜，做争取多数人的工作。扎尔基发了三次言。去建筑工地的事，多数学生听都不想听。身穿校服、戴着锤子领章的学生叫喊起哄，两次破坏了投票。扎尔基在这里没有依靠对象。两个团员对五百个学生，学生中三分之二又都是“爹妈的宝贝疙疸”。民主空气最好的是一年级，那里的头是阿廖沙。机械系一年级的头达尼洛夫也支持去工地。他是一个长着一对充满幻想的眼睛的青年。这两个年级多数人投了赞成票。到了第二天早晨，学校团支部才答应派四十名学生去修铁路。 \n \n 最后几只工具箱搬上了火车。乘务员也都站到了各自的岗位上。天下着蒙蒙细雨。丽达的皮夹克湿得发亮，雨珠像小玻璃球一样从上面滚下来。 \n \n 丽达在送别托卡列夫，她紧紧握住老人的手，轻声说：“祝你们成功。” \n \n 老人的眼睛从灰白的长眉毛下面亲切地看了看她。 \n \n “是呀，真他妈的给咱们找麻烦。”他咕哝了一句。“你们在这儿看着点。要是谁跟我们扯皮，你们看准地方，就给他们点厉害看看。这帮废物干什么都拖拖拉拉的。好了，孩子，我该上车了。” \n \n 托卡列夫裹紧了短外衣。就在他临上车前，丽达像是无意地问：“怎么，难道保尔不跟你们一起去吗？他怎么不在这儿呢？” \n \n “他昨天就坐轧道车走了，跟技术指导员打前站去了。” \n \n 扎尔基和杜巴瓦沿站台匆匆朝这边走来，同他们在一起的还有安娜·博哈特，她把短外套很随便地披在身上，纤细的手指夹着一支熄了的香烟。 \n \n 丽达注视着这三个人，又向托卡列夫提出了最后一个问题：“保尔跟你学得怎么样？” \n \n 托卡列夫惊讶地看了她一眼：“什么学得怎么样？那小伙子不是一直归你管的吗？他常跟我提到你，夸起来没个完。” \n \n 丽达仔细听着，有点不大相信老人的话。 \n \n “是这样吗，托卡列夫同志？他说他跟我学过的东西，都要上你那儿再学一遍。” \n \n 老人大笑起来。 \n \n “上我那儿？……我连他的影子都没见过。” \n \n 汽笛响了。克拉维切克在车厢里喊道：“乌斯季诺维奇同志，你放我们的大叔上车吧，这样不行啊！没有他我们可怎么办呢？” \n \n 这个捷克人还想说些什么，但是一看见走到跟前的那三个人，便不再做声了。他在瞬息间同安娜的不平静的眼神接触了一下，看到她对杜巴瓦露出惜别的微笑，觉得心里很不是滋味，便迅速离开了车窗。 \n \n 秋雨打着人们的脸。一团团饱含雨水的乌云，在低空慢慢移动。深秋，一望无际的森林里，树叶全落了。老榆树阴郁地站着，把满身皱纹藏在褐色的苔藓下面。无情的秋天剥去了它们华丽的盛装，它们只好光着枯瘦的身体站在那里。 \n \n 小车站孤独地隐在树林里。一条新修的路基从车站的石头货台伸向森林。路基周围是蚂蚁一样密集的人群。 \n \n 讨厌的粘泥在靴子底下扑哧扑哧直响。路基两旁的人们狠劲地挖着土。铁器发出沉重的撞击声，铁锹碰着石头，铿然作响。 \n \n 雨像用筛子筛过的一样，又细又密，下个不停。冰冷的雨水渗进了衣服。雨水也冲走了人们的劳动成果，泥浆如同稠粥从路基上淌下来。 \n \n 湿透了的衣服又重又冷，但是人们一直干到天黑透了才离开工地。 \n \n 修筑的路基一天比一天延长，不断伸向密林深处。 \n \n 离车站不远的地方，有一座石头房的空架子，凄凉地立在那里。里面的东西，凡是撬得下、拆得开、砸得动的，早就被洗劫一空了。门窗成了张口的大洞；炉门成了黑窟窿。房顶也破烂不堪，好多地方露出了椽子。 \n \n 唯一没有遭劫的是四个房间里的水泥地面。每天夜里，四百个人就穿着里外湿透、溅满泥浆的衣服躺在上面睡觉。大家在门口拧衣服，脏水一股股流下来。他们用最难听的话咒骂这恶劣的天气和遍地的泥泞。水泥地面上薄薄地铺了一层干草，他们紧挨着睡在上面，相互用体温取暖。衣服冒着气，但是从来没有干过。雨水渗过挡窗洞的麻袋，滴落到地上。雨点像密集的霰弹敲打着屋顶上残留的铁皮。冷风不断从破门缝里吹进来。 \n \n 厨房是一座破旧的板棚。早晨大家在这里草草吃完茶点，就到工地上去。午饭是单调得要命的素扁豆汤和一磅半几乎跟煤一样黑的面包。 \n \n 城里能够供应的只有这些东西。 \n \n 技术指导员瓦列里安·尼科季莫维奇·帕托什金是个高个子的干巴老头，脸上有两道很深的皱纹。技术员瓦库连科个子不高，但是很壮，粗笨的脸上长着一个肉墩墩的大鼻子。 \n \n 他们俩住在火车站站长家里。 \n \n 托卡列夫住在车站肃反工作人员霍利亚瓦的小房间里。 \n \n 霍利亚瓦长着两条短腿，像水银一样好动。 \n \n 筑路工程队以坚韧不拔的毅力经受着各种艰难困苦。 \n \n 路基一天天向森林的深处伸展。 \n \n 工程队里已经有九个人开了小差。过了几天，又跑了五个。 \n \n 筑路工程刚进行一个多星期，就受到了第一次打击——有一天晚上，火车没有从城里运面包来。 \n \n 杜巴瓦叫醒了托卡列夫，向他报告了这件事。 \n \n 工程队党组织书记托卡列夫坐起来，把两条长毛腿垂到地板上，使劲地搔着胳肢窝。 \n \n “真会开玩笑！”他一边咕哝，一边迅速穿上衣服。 \n \n 霍利亚瓦像球一样跑进房间来。 \n \n “快去挂电话，要特勤部。”托卡列夫吩咐他，接着又叮咛杜巴瓦：“面包的事，你对谁也不许说。” \n \n 不达目的决不罢休的霍利亚瓦跟电话接线员吵了半个钟头，终于同特勤部副部长朱赫来接通了电话。托卡列夫听他跟接线员争吵，急得直跺脚。 \n \n “什么？面包没送到？我马上就查，看是谁干的。”听筒里响起了朱赫来的怒吼声。 \n \n “你说吧，明天我们拿什么给大伙吃？”托卡列夫生气地朝话筒里喊。 \n \n 朱赫来显然在考虑怎么办。过了好一会儿，托卡列夫听到朱赫来说：“面包我们连夜送去。我派小利特克开车去，他认识路。天亮前一定送到。” \n \n 天刚透亮，一辆沾满泥浆的汽车开到了火车站，车上装着一袋装面包。小利特克疲惫地从车上爬下来，他因为一夜没有睡觉，脸色很苍白。 \n \n 为修建铁路而进行的斗争越来越艰苦。铁路管理局送来通知，说枕木用完了。城里也找不到车辆，不能把铁轨和小火车头运到工地上来，而且发现那些小火车头还需要大修。第一批筑路人员眼看就要到期，可是接班的人员还没有着落；现有的人员已经筋疲力尽，要把他们留下来再干，是不可能的。 \n \n 旧板棚里点着一盏油灯，积极分子在这里开会，一直到深夜还没有散。 \n \n 第二天早晨，托卡列夫、杜巴瓦和克拉维切克到城里去了，还带着六个人去修理火车头，运铁轨。克拉维切克是面包工人出身，这次派他到供应部门去当监督员，其余的人都到普夏—沃季察去。 \n \n 雨还是下个不停。 \n \n 保尔费了好大劲才把脚从泥里拔出来。他感到脚底下冰冷彻骨，知道是那只烂靴底掉下来了。他从到这里的第一天起，就一直吃这双破靴子的苦头。靴子总是湿漉漉的，走起路来里面的泥浆扑哧扑哧直响。现在倒好，一只靴底干脆掉下来了，他只好光着脚板泡在刺骨的泥泞里。这只破靴子害得他活都没法干。他从烂泥里捡起破靴底，绝望地看了看。虽然他已经发誓不再骂人，但是这次却怎么也忍不住了。他拎着破靴子朝板棚走去。他在行军灶旁边坐了下来，打开沾满污泥的包脚布，把那只冻木了的脚伸到炉子跟前。 \n \n 奥达尔卡正在案板上切甜菜。她是一个养路工人的妻子，在这里给厨师打下手。这个一点也不老的妇女可真是得天独厚——肩膀同男人的一样宽，胸脯高高隆起，大腿又粗又壮，切起菜来真有功夫，不一会儿案板上便堆成了一座小山。 \n \n 奥达尔卡轻蔑地瞥了保尔一眼，挖苦他说：“你怎么啦，等饭吃哪？还早呢。你这小伙子准是偷懒溜出来的。你把脚丫子伸哪儿去啦？这儿是厨房，不是澡堂子！” \n \n 她训斥着保尔。 \n \n 一个上了年纪的厨师走了进来。 \n \n “靴子全烂了。”保尔解释了一下他到厨房来的原因。 \n \n 厨师看了看破靴子，对奥达尔卡点了点头，说：“她男人是半拉子鞋匠，让他帮帮你的忙吧，没鞋穿就别想要命了。” \n \n 奥达尔卡听厨师这样说，又仔细看了看保尔，感到有点不好意思。 \n \n “我把您错当成懒虫了。”她抱歉地说。 \n \n 保尔笑了笑。奥达尔卡用行家的眼光翻看着那只靴子。 \n \n “我们当家的才不补它呢。——不顶事了。我家阁楼上有一只旧套鞋，我给您拿来吧，可别冻坏了脚。受这种罪，哪儿见过呀！明后天就要上大冻，那您可够受的。”奥达尔卡同情地说。她放下菜刀，走了出去。 \n \n 不一会儿，她拿来一只高统套鞋和一块亚麻布。保尔用布包好脚，烤得热乎乎的，穿上了暖和的套鞋。这时，他以感激的心情，默默地看了看养路工的妻子。 \n \n 托卡列夫从城里回来，窝着一肚子火。他把积极分子召集到霍利亚瓦的房间里，向他们讲了那些令人不快的消息。 \n \n “到处都怠工。不管你到哪儿，车轮都没停，可就是在原地打转。对那些反动家伙，看来咱们还是抓少了，一辈子都得碰上这号人。”老人对屋里的人说。“同志们，我就跟你们明说了吧：情况糟透了。到现在换班的人还没凑齐，能派来多少也不知道。转眼就要上大冻。上冻前，豁出命来也要把路铺过那片洼地。不然，以后用牙啃也啃不动。就是这样，同志们，城里那帮捣鬼的家伙，会有人收拾他们的，咱们呢，要在这儿加油干，快干。哪怕脱五层皮，也要修好。要不，咱们还叫什么布尔什维克呢？只能算草包。”托卡列夫的声音铿锵有力，完全不是平时那种沙哑的低音。紧锁着的眉毛下面，两只眼睛炯炯发亮，说明他坚定不移，下决心干到底。 \n \n “今天咱们就召开党团员会议，向同志们讲清楚，明天大家照常上工。非党非团的同志，明天早晨就可以回去，党团员都留下。这儿是团省委的决议。”说着，他把一张叠成四折的纸交给了潘克拉托夫。 \n \n 保尔从潘克拉托夫肩头看过去，纸上写的是： \n \n 团省委认为，全体共青团员应继续留在工地，待第一批木柴运出以后方能换班。 \n \n 共青团省委书记丽达·乌斯季诺维奇（代签）。 \n \n 板棚里挤得水泄不通。一百二十个人都挤在这里。人们靠板壁站着，有的上了桌子，甚至灶上也有人。 \n \n 潘克拉托夫宣布开会。托卡列夫讲话不长，但是最后一句一下子叫大家凉了半截：“明天共产党员和共青团员都不能回城里去。” \n \n 老人的手在空中挥了一下，强调这个决定是不可改变的。 \n \n 这个手势把大家摆脱污泥、返回城里同家人团聚的希望扫得精光。一开始，会场里一片喊叫声，什么也听不清。人体晃动着，暗淡的灯光也跟着摇曳起来。昏暗中看不见人们脸上的表情。吵嚷声越来越大。有的人憧憬着谈论起“家庭的舒适”，有的人气愤地叫喊着，说太疲劳了。更多的人沉默不语。 \n \n 只有一个人声明要离队。他连喊带骂，从角落里发出忿忿不平的声音：“去他妈的！我一天也不在这儿待了！罚犯人做苦工，那是因为他们犯了罪。可凭什么罚我们？逼我们干了两星期，也就够了。没那么多傻瓜。谁做了决议，谁自己来干。谁乐意在污泥里打滚，谁就去打滚好了，我可只有一条命。我明天就走。” \n \n 这个大喊大叫的人就站在奥库涅夫背后。奥库涅夫划着一根火柴，想看看这个要开小差的人。火柴点燃的一瞬间，照亮了一张气歪了的脸和张开的大嘴。奥库涅夫认出他是省粮食委员会会计的儿子。 \n \n “你照什么？我不怕，又不是贼。” \n \n 火柴灭了。潘克拉托夫站起来，挺直了身子。 \n \n “谁在那儿胡说八道？谁说党给的任务是苦工？”他瓮声瓮气地说，严峻地扫视着站在周围的人群。“弟兄们，咱们说什么也不能回城去，咱们的岗位就在这儿。要是咱们从这儿溜走，许多人就得冻死。弟兄们，咱们赶紧干完，就可以早点回去。当逃兵，像这个可怜虫想的那样，是咱们的思想和咱们的纪律所不容许的。” \n \n 这个码头工人不喜欢发表长篇大论，但是，就是这短短的几句话，也被刚才那个人的声音打断了：“那么，非党非团的可以走吗？” \n \n “可以。”潘克拉托夫斩钉截铁地说。 \n \n 那个家伙穿着城里人常穿的短大衣，朝桌子挤了过来。他扔出一张小卡片，卡片像蝙蝠一样在桌子上方翻了一个筋斗，撞在潘克拉托夫胸口上，弹了回来，立着落在桌子上。 \n \n “这是我的团证，收回去吧，我可不为一张硬纸片卖命！” \n \n 他的后半句话被全场爆发出来的叱骂声淹没了。 \n \n “你扔掉了什么！” \n \n “你这个出卖灵魂的家伙！” \n \n “钻到共青团里来，想的就是升官发财！” \n \n “把他撵出去！” \n \n “看我们不揍你一顿，你这个传播伤寒病的虱子！” \n \n 扔团证的那个家伙低着头朝门口挤去。大家像躲避瘟神一样闪向两旁，放他过去。他一走出去，门就呀的一声关上了。 \n \n 潘克拉托夫抓起扔下的团证，伸到小油灯的火苗上。 \n \n 卡片烧着了，卷了起来，变成了一个黑色的小圆筒。 \n \n 森林里响了一枪。一个骑马的人迅速逃离破旧的板棚，钻进了黑漆漆的森林。人们从学校和板棚里跑出来。有人无意中碰到一块插在门缝里的胶合板上。人们划亮火柴，用衣服下摆挡住风，借着火光，看到胶合板上写着： \n \n 滚出车站！从哪里来的，滚回哪里去。谁敢赖着不走，就叫他脑袋开花。我们要把你们斩尽杀绝，对谁也不留情。限明天晚上以前滚蛋。 \n \n 下面的署名是：大头目切斯诺克。 \n \n 切斯诺克是奥尔利克匪帮里的人物。 \n \n 在丽达的房间里，桌子上放着一本没有合上的日记。 \n \n １２月２日 \n \n 早晨下了第一场雪。天很冷。在楼梯上遇见维亚切斯拉夫·奥利申斯基。我们一起走着。 \n \n “我就喜欢初雪。一派寒冬景象！多么迷人，是不是？”奥利申斯基说。 \n \n 我想起了在博亚尔卡的人们，就回答他说，我对寒冬和这场雪丝毫没有好感，相反，只觉得心里烦恼。我向他解释了原因。 \n \n “这种想法很主观。如果把您的想法引申下去，那就应该认为，比方说在战时，笑声和一切乐观的表现都是不许可的。 \n \n 但是生活里并不是这样。悲剧只发生在前线，在那里，生命常常受到死神的威胁。然而即便在前线，也还有笑声。至于远离前线的地方，生活当然还是照旧：嬉笑、眼泪、痛苦、欢乐、追求眼福和享受、感情的风波、爱情……” \n \n 从奥利申斯基的话中，很难听出哪句只是说着玩的。他是外交人民委员部的特派员，一九一七年入党。他的衣着是西欧式的，胡子总是刮得光光的，身上洒点香水。他就住在我们这幢楼中谢加尔那套房间里。晚上常常来看我。同他聊天倒挺有意思，他在巴黎住过很长时间，知道西方的许多事情。但是我并不认为，我们能够成为好朋友。因为他首先把我看作一个女人，其次才看作一个党内同志。诚然，他并不掩饰他的意图和思想——他在说实话上，倒是有足够的勇气——而且，他的情意也并不粗野。他善于把那番情意表达得很漂亮。但是我并不喜欢他。 \n \n 对我来说，朱赫来那种略带粗犷的朴实，比起奥利申斯基的西欧式的风雅来，不知要亲切多少倍。 \n \n 我们从博亚尔卡收到了一些简短的报告。每天铺路一百俄丈。他们把枕木直接铺在冻土上，放在刨出来的座槽里。那里总共只有二百四十个人。第二批人员已经有一半逃走了。环境确实很艰苦。在那样的冰天雪地里，他们往后怎么工作呢？ \n \n ……杜巴瓦到普夏—沃季察去已经一个星期了。那里有七个火车头，他们只修好了五个。其余的没有零件了。 \n \n 电车公司对杜巴瓦提出了刑事诉讼，控告他带着一帮人，强行扣留从普夏—沃季察开到城里来的全部电车。他把乘客动员下来，把铺支线用的轶轨装到车上，然后沿着城里的电车线路把十九辆车统统开到火车站。他们得到了电车工人的全力支援。 \n \n 在火车站，索洛缅卡区的一群共青团员连夜把铁轨装上了火车，杜巴瓦带着他那一帮人把铁轨运到了博亚尔卡。 \n \n 阿基姆拒绝把杜巴瓦的问题提到常委会上讨论。杜巴瓦向我们反映，电车公司的官僚主义和拖拉作风简直不像话。他们顶多只肯给两辆车，连商量的余地也没有。可是图夫塔却教训起杜巴瓦来：“该把游击作风扔掉了，现在再这么干，就要蹲监狱。难道不能跟他们好好商量，非用武力不可吗？” \n \n 我还从来没有看到过杜巴瓦发那么大的火。 \n \n “你这个死啃公文的家伙，自己怎么不去跟他们好好商量呢？坐在这儿，喝饱了墨水，就耍嘴皮子，唱高调。我不把铁轨送到博亚尔卡，就要挨骂。我看得把你送到工地上去，请托卡列夫管教管教，省得在这儿碍手碍脚，惹人讨厌！”杜巴瓦暴跳如雷，整个省委大楼都可以听到他的吼声。 \n \n 图夫塔写了一个要求处分杜巴瓦的报告，但是阿基姆让我暂时出去一下，单独同他谈了大约十分钟。图夫塔从阿基姆房间出来的时候，满脸通红，怒气冲冲。 \n \n １２月３日 \n \n 省委又收到了新的控告信，这回是铁路肃反委员会送来的。潘克拉托夫、奥库涅夫，还有另外几个同志，在莫托维洛夫卡车站拆走了空房子的门窗。当他们把拆下来的东西往火车上搬的时候，站上的一个肃反工作人员想逮捕他们。但是他们缴了他的枪，直到火车开动了，才把退空了子弹的手枪还给他。门窗都运走了。另外，铁路局物资处控告托卡列夫擅自从博亚尔卡仓库提出二十普特钉子，发给农民作为报酬，让农民帮他们从伐木场运出长木头，代替枕木使用。 \n \n 我跟朱赫来同志谈了这两件事，他笑笑说：“这些控告咱们都给顶回去。” \n \n 工地上的情况十分紧张，每一天都是宝贵的。在一些微不足道的小事上，往往也需要施加压力。我们常常要把那些专门制造障碍的人拉到省委来。工地上的同志们不守常规的事越来越多了。 \n \n 奥利申斯基给我送来了一个小电炉。我和奥莉加·尤列涅娃用它烤手。但是房间里并没有因为有了电炉而暖和一些。 \n \n 那么在森林里人们怎样捱过这样的夜晚呢？奥莉加说，医院里很冷，病人都不敢爬出被窝。他们隔两天才生一次火。 \n \n 你错了，奥利申斯基同志，前线的悲剧也就是后方的悲剧！ \n \n １２月４日 \n \n 大雪下了整整一夜。有报告说，博亚尔卡工地全都给大雪封住了。工程停了下来。人们在清除路上的积雪。今天省委决定：第一期筑路工程一定要在一九二二年一月一日以前完成，把路铺到伐木场边缘。据说，这个决定传达到博亚尔卡的时候，托卡列夫的回答是：“只要我们还有一个人在，一定按期完工。” \n \n 关于保尔，一点消息也没有。他居然没有像潘克拉托夫那样受到“控告”，这倒是怪事。我直到现在也不知道，他为什么不愿意同我见面。 \n \n １２月５日 \n \n 昨天匪徒袭击了工地。 \n \n 马在松软的雪地上谨慎地迈着步子。马蹄偶尔踩在雪下的枯枝上，树枝折断，发出劈啪的响声。这时马就打个响鼻，闪到一边去，但是抿着的耳朵挨了一枪托后，又急步赶上前去。 \n \n 大约有十个人骑着马，翻过了一片起伏不平的丘陵地，丘陵地的前面是一长条没有被雪覆盖的黑色地面。 \n \n 他们在这里勒住了马。马镫碰在一起，当地响了一声。领头的那匹公马使劲抖动了一下身体，长途跋涉使它浑身冒着热气。 \n \n “他们人真他妈的来得不少，”领头的人用乌克兰话说。 \n \n “咱们狠狠吓唬他们一下。大头目下令，一定要让这群蝗虫明天全都滚蛋。眼看这帮臭工人就要把木柴弄到手了……” \n \n 他们排成单行，沿轻便铁路两侧朝车站走去，慢慢地靠近了林业学校旁边的一片空地。他们隐藏在树背后，没有敢到空地上来。 \n \n 一阵枪声打破了黑夜的寂静。雪团像松鼠似的，从那棵被月光照成银白色的桦树上滚落下来。短筒枪贴着树身，吐出火光，子弹打在墙上，泥灰纷纷掉在地上，潘克拉托夫他们运来的玻璃窗也被打得粉碎。 \n \n 枪声惊醒了睡在水泥地上的人，他们立即跳了起来，但是一见房间里子弹横飞，又都卧倒了。 \n \n 有人压在别人身上。 \n \n “你要上哪儿去？”杜巴瓦一把抓住保尔的军大衣问。 \n \n “出去。” \n \n “趴下，傻瓜！你一露头，就会把你撂倒。”杜巴瓦急促地低声说。 \n \n 他俩紧挨着躲在大门旁边。杜巴瓦紧贴在地上，一只手握着手枪，伸向门口。保尔蹲着，手指紧张地摸着转轮手枪的弹槽，里面只有五颗子弹了。他摸到空槽，便把转轮转了过去。 \n \n 射击突然停止了。接着是一片令人惊奇的寂静。 \n \n “同志们，有枪的都到这边来。”杜巴瓦低声指挥那些伏在地上的人。 \n \n 保尔小心地打开了门。空地上连人影也没有，只有雪花缓慢地飘舞着，落向地面。 \n \n 森林里，十个人狠命抽着马，逃走了。 \n \n 午饭的时候，城里飞快地开来一辆轧道车。朱赫来和阿基姆走下车来。托卡列夫和霍利亚瓦在站台上迎接他们。车上卸下一挺马克沁机枪、几箱机枪子弹和二十支步枪。 \n \n 他们急急忙忙地向工地走去。朱赫来的大衣下摆擦在地面的积雪上，留下了一道道锯齿形的曲线。他走起路来像熊一样，左右摇晃。老习惯还是改不了：两条腿总像圆规似的叉开着，仿佛脚下仍然是颠簸的甲板。阿基姆个子高，步子大，能跟得上朱赫来，托卡列夫走一会儿，就要跑几步，才能跟上他们。 \n \n “匪徒的袭击——还是次要问题。眼前有个山包横在路上，倒是麻烦事，这么个大家伙叫我们碰上了，真他妈的晦气！得挖很多土方才行。” \n \n 托卡列夫站住了。他背过身子，两手拢成小船的样子，挡住风，点着烟，赶紧抽了两口，又去追赶前边的人。阿基姆停下来等他。朱赫来没有放慢脚步，继续往前走。 \n \n 阿基姆问托卡列夫：“这条支线你们能按期修好吗？” \n \n 托卡列夫没有立即回答，过了一会儿才说：“你知道，老弟，一般说来是不能按期修好的，但是不修好也不行。问题就这么明摆着。” \n \n 他们赶上朱赫来，三个人并排走着。托卡列夫很激动地接着说：“问题难，就难在这里。工地上只有我和帕托什金两个人心里清楚，这个地方条件这样差，人力和设备又这样少，按期完工是不可能的。但是，同时全体筑路人员都知道，不按期完工绝对不行。所以我上回才说：只要我们还有一个人在，就一定完成任务。现在你们亲眼看看吧！我们在这儿挖土已经快两个月了，第四班眼看又要到期，可是基本成员一直没换过班，完全靠青春的活力支持着。这些人当中，有一半受了寒。看着这些小伙子，真叫人心疼。他们是无价之宝……有些人连命也会断送在这个鬼地方，而且不止一两个人。” \n \n 从车站起，已经有一公里铁路修好了。 \n \n 往前，大约有一公里半，是平整好的路基，上面挖了座槽，座槽里铺着一排长木头，看上去像是被大风刮倒的栅栏。 \n \n 这就是枕木。再往前，一直到小山包跟前，是一条刚平出来的路面。 \n \n 在这里干活的是潘克拉托夫的第一筑路队。他们四十个人正在铺枕木。一个留着红胡子的农民，穿一双新的树皮鞋，不慌不忙地把木头从雪橇上卸下来，扔在路基上。再远一点的地方，也有几个这样的雪橇在卸木头。地上放着两根长长的铁棍，代替路轨，用来给枕木找平。为了把路基夯实，斧子、铁棍、铁锹全都用上了。 \n \n 铺枕木是一项细致的工作，很费工夫。枕木要铺得既牢固又平稳，使每根枕木都承受铁轨同样的压力。 \n \n 这里懂得铺路技术的只有筑路工长拉古京一个人。这位老同志虽然五十四岁了，却一根白头发也没有，黑黑的胡子从中间向两边分开。他每次都自愿留下，现在已经是干第四班了。他跟年轻人一样忍受饥寒困苦，因此，在筑路队里受到普遍的尊敬。党组织每次开会，都邀请这位非党同志（他是塔莉亚的父亲）出席，请他坐在荣誉席上。为此，他很自豪，发誓决不离开工地。 \n \n “你们说说看，我怎么能扔下你们不管呢？我一走，你们会搞乱的，这儿需要有人照看，需要实践经验。我在俄罗斯跟枕木打了一辈子交道……”每到换班的时候，他都和蔼地这样说，于是就一次又一次地留了下来。 \n \n 帕托什金很信任他，很少到他这个工段来检查工作。当朱赫来他们三个人走到正在劳动的人群跟前时，累得浑身冒汗、满脸通红的潘克拉托夫正用斧子砍着安放枕木的座槽。 \n \n 阿基姆好不容易才认出了这个码头工人。他瘦多了，两个大颧骨显得更加突出，脸也没有好好洗过，看上去又黑又憔悴。 \n \n “啊，省里的大人物来了！”说着，他把热乎乎、湿漉漉的手伸给阿基姆。 \n \n 铁锹的声音停了下来。阿基姆看见周围的人脸色都很苍白。人们脱下的大衣和皮袄就放在旁边的雪地上。 \n \n 托卡列夫跟拉古京说了几句话，就拉着潘克拉托夫一起，陪刚来的朱赫来和阿基姆向小山包走去。潘克拉托夫和朱赫来并肩走着。 \n \n “潘克拉托夫，你讲讲，你们在莫托维洛夫卡整肃反工作人员是怎么回事？你们把人家的枪都缴了，你不认为这做得有点过火吗？”朱赫来严肃地问这个不爱做声的码头工人。 \n \n 潘克拉托夫不好意思地笑了一下，说：“我们缴他的枪，是跟他商量好的，他自己要我们这么干的。这小伙子跟我们是一条心。我们把情况如实跟他一摆，他就说：‘同志们，我没有权力让你们把门窗卸走。捷尔任斯基同志有命令，严禁盗窃铁路财产。这儿的站长跟我结了仇，这个坏蛋老偷东西，我总是干涉他。要是我让你们把门窗拿走，他一定会上告，我就要到革命法庭受审。最好你们先下了我的枪，再把东西运走。站长不上告，就算没事了。’于是我们照他说的办了。我们又没把门窗往自己家里拉！” \n \n 潘克拉托夫看到朱赫来眼睛里露出一丝笑意，又补充说：“朱赫来同志，要处分就处分我们吧！您可千万别难为那个小伙子。” \n \n “这件事就算过去了。今后再这样干可不行——这是破坏纪律的行为。我们完全有力量通过组织手段粉碎官僚主义。好了，现在谈谈更重要的事吧。”于是朱赫来把匪徒袭击的详情询问了一遍。 \n \n 在离车站四公里半的地方，筑路的人们挥动铁锹，猛攻坚硬的冻土。他们要劈开挡在面前的小山包，修出一条路来。 \n \n 工地周围，有七个人担任警戒。他们随身带着霍利亚瓦的马枪和保尔、潘克拉托夫、杜巴瓦、霍穆托夫的手枪。筑路队的全部武器都在这里了。 \n \n 帕托什金坐在斜坡上，往本子上记着数字。工地上只剩下他一个工程技术人员了。他的助手瓦库连科怕被土匪打死，宁可受法办，也不在这里干，一清早开小差溜回城里去了。 \n \n “挖开这个山包，要花半个月的时间，地都冻了。”帕托什金低声对他面前的霍穆托夫说。霍穆托夫是个动作迟缓、总皱着眉头、不大爱讲话的人。他一听这话，生气地用嘴咬着胡子梢，回答说：“全部工程限我们二十五天完成，光挖山包您就计划用十五天，这怎么成！” \n \n “这个期限定得不切合实际。”帕托什金说。“不错，我这辈子从来没有这样的条件下筑过路，也没同这样的筑路工人共过事。因此，我也可能估计错，以前就错过两回了。” \n \n 这时，朱赫来、阿基姆和潘克拉托夫走近了小山包。斜坡上的人发现了他们。 \n \n “瞧！谁来了？”铁路工厂的旋工彼佳·特罗菲莫夫，一个斜眼的小伙子，用露在破绒衣外面的胳膊肘捅了保尔一下，指着坡下刚来的人说。保尔连铁锹也没有顾得放下，立刻向坡下跑去。他的两只眼睛在帽檐下热情地微笑着，朱赫来紧紧地握住他的手，握的时间比谁都长。 \n \n “你好啊，保尔！瞧你这身衣服，大的大，小的小，简直认不出你来了。” \n \n 潘克拉托夫苦笑了一下。 \n \n “你没看他那五个脚趾头，行动有多一致，全在外面露着。 \n \n 这还不算，开小差的人还把他的大衣偷走了。亏得奥库涅夫是他们同一个公社的，把自己的破上衣给了他。不过不要紧，保夫鲁沙是个热血青年，他还可以在水泥地板上躺上一个星期，铺不铺干草都行，然后再进棺材。”码头工人怏怏不乐地对阿基姆说。 \n \n 黑眉毛、鼻子微翘的奥库涅夫调皮地眯起眼睛，反驳说：“我们才不让保夫鲁沙完蛋呢。我们可以推举他到厨房去，给奥达尔卡当后备火头军。他要不是傻瓜，那儿吃的也有，暖和地方也有——靠着炉子也行，挨着奥达尔卡也可以。” \n \n 一阵哄笑淹没了奥库涅夫的话。 \n \n 这是今天他们发出的第一阵笑声。 \n \n 朱赫来察看了小山包，然后同托卡列夫、帕托什金坐雪橇到伐木场去了一趟，又转了回来。斜坡上的人还在坚持不懈地挖土。朱赫来望着飞舞的铁锹，望着弯腰紧张劳动的人群，低声对阿基姆说：“群众大会用不着开了，这儿谁也不需要进一步动员。托卡列夫，你说得对，这些人是无价之宝。钢铁就是这样炼成的！” \n \n 朱赫来看着这些挖土的人，眼神里充满了喜悦、疼爱和庄严的自豪。就在不久以前，在那次反革命叛乱的前夜，他们当中的一部分人，曾经扛起钢枪，投入战斗。现在，他们又胸怀一个共同目标，要把钢铁动脉铺到堆放着大量木柴的宝地去，全城的人都在急切地盼望着这些木柴给他们带来温暖和生命。 \n \n 帕托什金工程师有礼貌地，但又不容置疑地向朱赫来证明：要在这个小山包上开出一条路来，没有两个星期的时间是不可能的。朱赫来一面听他计算，一面心里打着主意。 \n \n “您把斜坡上的人撤下来，调到前面去修路，这个小山包咱们另想办法。” \n \n 朱赫来在车站的电话机旁待了很长时间。霍利亚瓦在门口警卫，他听见朱赫来在屋里粗声粗气地说：“用我的名义马上给军区参谋长挂个电话，请他立刻把普济列夫斯基那个团调到筑路工地这一带来。一定要把这个地区的匪徒肃清。另外，再从部队派一列装甲车和几名爆破手来。其他事情我自己安排。我夜里回去。让利特克在十二点以前把车开到车站来。” \n \n 在板棚里，阿基姆简短地讲过几句话以后，朱赫来接着讲起来。他亲切地同大家交谈着，一个小时不知不觉地过去了。朱赫来告诉大家，原定的计划不能变，第一期工程必须在一月一日以前完工。 \n \n “从现在起，筑路队要按战时状态组织起来。所有党员编成一个特勤中队，中队长由杜巴瓦同志担任。六个筑路小队都接受固定的任务。没有完成的工程平均分成六段，每队承担一段。全部工程必须在一月一日以前结束。提前完成任务的小队可以回城休息。另外，省执行委员会主席团还要向全乌克兰中央执行委员会呈报，给这个小队最优秀的工人颁发红旗勋章。” \n \n 各队的队长都派定了：第一队是潘克拉托夫同志，第二队是杜巴瓦同志，第三队是霍穆托夫同志，第四队是拉古京同志，第五队是柯察金同志，第六队是奥库涅夫同志。 \n \n “筑路工程队队长、思想工作和组织工作的总负责人，”朱赫来在结束发言时说。“仍然是安东·尼基福罗维奇·托卡列夫，这是非他莫属的。” \n \n 仿佛一群鸟突然振翅起飞一样，噼噼啪啪地响起了一阵掌声。一张张刚毅的脸上露出了笑容。朱赫来一向很严肃，他最后这句话却说得既亲切又风趣，一直在注意听他讲话的人全都轻松地笑了起来。 \n \n 二十几个人簇拥着阿基姆和朱赫来，一直把他们送上轧道车。 \n \n 朱赫来同保尔道别的时候，望着他那只灌满雪的套鞋，低声对他说：“我给你捎双靴子来，你的脚还没冻坏吧？” \n \n “好像是冻坏了，已经肿起来了。”保尔说到这里，想起了很久以前提出过的请求，抓住朱赫来的袖子，央求说：“我跟你要过几发手枪子弹，现在你能给我吗？我这儿能用的只有三发了。” \n \n 朱赫来抱歉地摇了摇头，但是他看到保尔一脸失望的神情，就毅然决然地解下了自己的毛瑟枪。 \n \n “这是我送给你的礼物。” \n \n 保尔开头简直不敢相信，他会得到一件盼望了这么久的贵重礼物，可是朱赫来已经把枪带挂在他的肩膀上。 \n \n “拿着吧，拿着吧！我知道你早就眼红了。不过你要多加小心，可不许打自己人。这支枪还有满满三夹子弹，也给你。” \n \n 一道道羡慕的目光立刻射到保尔身上。不知是谁喊着说：“保尔，咱俩换吧，我给你一双靴子，外带一件短大衣。” \n \n 潘克拉托夫在保尔背上推了一下，打趣地说：“鬼东西，换毡靴穿吧。要是再穿你那只套鞋，连圣诞节也活不到！” \n \n 这时候，朱赫来一只脚踏着轧道车的踏板，正在给保尔开持枪许可证。 \n \n 清晨，一列装甲车轰隆轰隆驶过道岔，开进了车站。一团团天鹅绒般的白色蒸汽，像盛开的绣球花一样喷发出来，又立即消失在清新而寒冷的空气里。从装甲车厢里走出来几个穿皮衣的人。几小时以后，装甲车送来的三个爆破手在斜坡上深深地埋下了两个深蓝色的大南瓜，接上了长长的导火线。 \n \n 放了信号枪之后，人们便纷纷离开现在已经变成险地的小山包，四散隐蔽。火柴触到了导火线，磷光闪了一下。 \n \n 刹那间，几百个人的心都提了起来。一分钟，两分钟，等待是那样难熬——终于……大地颤抖了一下，一股可怕的力量炸开了小山包，把巨大的土块抛向天空。接着，第二炮又响了，比第一炮还要厉害。可怕的轰鸣响彻密林，山崩地裂的隆隆声在林间回荡。 \n \n 刚才还是小山包的那个地方，现在出现了一个张着大口的深坑，方圆几十米内，在像糖一样洁白的雪地上，撒满了爆破出来的土块。 \n \n 人们拿着镐和锹一齐向炸开的深坑冲去。 \n \n 朱赫来走后，工地上展开了争取首先完成任务的异常激烈的竞赛。 \n \n 离天亮还很早，保尔谁也没有惊动，就悄悄地起来了。他独自艰难地迈着在水泥地上冻僵了的双脚，到厨房去了。烧开了一桶沏茶水，才回去叫醒他那个小队的队员。 \n \n 等到其他各队的人醒来，外面天已经亮了。 \n \n 在板棚里吃早点的时候，潘克拉托夫挤到杜巴瓦和他的兵工厂伙伴的桌子跟前，激愤地对他说：“看见了没有，德米特里，天蒙蒙亮，保尔就把他那伙人叫了起来。现在他们大概已经铺了十俄丈了。听大伙说，他们铁路工厂的人，弦都让他给绷得紧紧的，他们决心在二十五号以前铺完自己分担的地段。他这是想给咱们点颜色看哪。但是，对不起，咱们走着瞧吧！” \n \n 杜巴瓦苦笑了一下。他非常理解，为什么铁路工厂那一队的行动，会使这位货运码头的共青团书记如此激动。就连他杜巴瓦也挨了好朋友保尔一闷棍：保尔竟连招呼也不打，就向各队挑战了。 \n \n “真是朋友归朋友，有烟各自抽——这里有个‘谁战胜谁’的问题。”潘克拉托夫说。 \n \n 快到中午了，柯察金小队正干得热火朝天，突然一声枪响，打断了他们的工作。这是站在步枪垛旁边的哨兵，发现树林里来了一队骑兵，在鸣枪示警。 \n \n “拿枪，弟兄们！土匪来了！”保尔喊了一声，扔下铁锹，朝一棵大树跑去，树上挂着他的毛瑟枪。 \n \n 全队马上拿起武器，贴着路边直接卧倒在雪地上。走在前面的几个骑兵挥着帽子，其中有个人喊道：“别开枪，同志们！自己人！” \n \n 五十来个骑兵顺着大路跑了过来，他们都戴着缀红星的布琼尼帽。 \n \n 原来这是普济列夫斯基团的一个排，前来探望筑路人员。 \n \n 排长的坐骑少一只耳朵，这引起了保尔的注意。那是一匹漂亮的灰骒马，额上有一块白斑，它在骑者身下“跳着舞”，不肯老实站着。保尔跑到它跟前，一把抓住笼头绳，马吓得直往后退。 \n \n “小斑秃，你这个淘气鬼，想不到在这儿碰见你！你没让子弹打死啊，我的缺只耳朵的美人。” \n \n 他亲切地搂住马的细长脖子，抚摸着它那翕动的鼻子。排长仔细地端详着保尔，一下认出来了，他惊奇地喊道：“啊，这不是保尔吗！……马你认出来了，老朋友谢列达反倒不认识啦。你好，兄弟！” \n \n 城里各部门都积极行动起来，全力支援筑路工程。这立刻产生了良好的效果。扎尔基把还在城里的人都派到了博亚尔卡，团区委的人走个精光。整个索络缅卡区只剩下一些女团员了。扎尔基又到铁路专科学校去动员，结果他们又派了一批学生到工地去。 \n \n 他向阿基姆汇报这些情况的时候，半开玩笑地说：“现在只剩下我和女无产者了。我想让拉古京娜替我，门口换上‘妇女部’的牌子，我就上博亚尔卡去。要知道，我一个男子汉在人家女人堆里转悠，实在不像话。姑娘们都怀疑地瞧着我。这帮喜鹊私下里准在嘁嘁喳喳议论我：‘他把别人都撵走了，自己却泡在城里，这个大滑头。’说不定还有比这更难听的。求求你，让我也去吧。” \n \n 阿基姆笑着拒绝了。 \n \n 一批一批的人不断到博亚尔卡来，铁路专科学校的六十名学生也到了。 \n \n 朱赫来设法让铁路管理局调了四节客车到博亚尔卡，给新到的工人住宿。 \n \n 杜巴瓦小队从工地撤了下来，派到普夏—沃季察去。他们的任务是把供轻便铁路用的小火车头和六十五节平板车运到工地来。这项工作顶替他们在工地上承担的一部分任务。 \n \n 杜巴瓦出发前向托卡列夫建议，把克拉维切克调回来，叫他领导新成立的一个小队。托卡列夫采纳了他的建议，下达了命令，根本没有去想他的真实动机。而杜巴瓦这个时候会想起那个捷克人，却是安娜托索洛缅卡来的人带来的一张便条引起的。便条上这样写着： \n \n 德米特里：我和克拉维切克给你们挑了一大批书报。我们向你和博亚尔卡的全体突击手们致以热烈的敬礼。你们都是好样的！祝你们身体强健，精神饱满。昨天，各木柴场的最后一批存货都配售完了。克拉维切克要我向你们致意。他真是个好小伙子。他亲自给你们烤面包。他对面包房里的人，谁也信不过。他自己动手筛面粉，自己用机器和面。不知道他从哪儿弄来的好面粉，面包做得好极了，跟我领到的简直没法比。晚上咱们的人都到我这里来，有拉古京娜、阿尔秋欣、克拉维切克，扎尔基有时也来。我们也搞点学习，但主要是议论我们所知道的人和事，无所不谈，而谈得最多的还是你们。姑娘们对托卡列夫不让她们去工地意见可大了。她们说保证能和你们大家一样吃苦耐劳。拉古京娜说：“我换上一身爸爸的衣服，一下子跑到那老爷子跟前，看他能把我撵回来！” \n \n 说不定她真会这样做。替我向你那个黑眼睛的朋友问好。 \n \n 安娜 \n \n 暴风雪突然袭来。灰色的阴云低低地压在地面上，移动着，布满了天空。大雪纷纷飘落下来。晚上，刮起了大风，烟筒发出了呜呜的怒吼。风追逐着在树林中飞速盘旋、左躲右闪的雪花，凄厉地呼啸着，搅得整个森林惊惶不安。 \n \n 暴风雪咆哮不止，猖狂了一夜。车站上那间破房子根本存不住热气，虽然通宵生着火，大家还是从里到外都冻透了。 \n \n 第二天清晨上工，雪深得使人迈不开步，而树梢上却挂着一轮红彤彤的太阳，碧蓝的天空没有一丝云彩。 \n \n 柯察金的小队在清除自己地段上的积雪。直到这时保尔才体会到，严寒造成的痛苦是多么难以忍受。奥库涅夫那件旧上衣一点也不保暖，脚上那只旧套鞋老往里灌雪，好几次掉在雪里找不到。另一只脚上的靴子也随时有掉底的危险。由于睡在水泥地上，他脖子上长了两个大痈疮。托卡列夫把自己的毛巾送给他做了围巾。 \n \n 瘦骨嶙峋的保尔两眼熬得通红，他猛烈地挥动大木锨铲雪。 \n \n 这时，一列客车爬进了车站，有气无力的火车头勉勉强强把它拖到了这里。煤水车上一块木柴也没有，炉里的余火也快要熄灭了。 \n \n “给我们木柴，就开走；不给，就趁它还能动弹，让我停到侧线上去！”司机向站长喊道。 \n \n 列车开到侧线上去了。他们把停车的原因通知了沮丧的旅客。挤得满满的车厢里响起了一片叫嚷和咒骂。 \n \n “你们去跟那个老头讲讲，就是在站台上走着的那个，他是工地的负责人。工地上有当枕木用的木头，他可以下令用雪橇给火车头运点来。”站长给乘务员们出了个主意。乘务员们立刻迎着托卡列夫走去。 \n \n “要木柴可以，但是不能白给。要知道，这是我们的建筑材料。现在工地让雪封住了。车上有六七百个乘客。妇女、小孩可以留在车里，其他人都得拿起锨来铲雪，干到晚上，就给你们木柴。要是不愿意干，那就让他们等到新年再说。”托卡列夫对乘务员们说。 \n \n “瞧！同志们，来了这么多人！看，还有女的呢！”保尔背后有人惊奇地说。 \n \n 保尔回过头去。 \n \n 托卡列夫走到跟前，对他说：“给你一百人，分配他们干活吧。看着点，别叫他们偷懒。” \n \n 保尔给这些新来的人派了活。有一个高个子男人，穿着皮领子的铁路制服大衣，戴着羔皮帽，正跟旁边的一个青年妇女说话。那青年妇女戴着一顶海狗皮帽，顶上还有个绒球。 \n \n 他愤愤地转动着手里的木锨，大发牢骚：“我才不铲雪呢，谁也没有权力强迫我。要是请我这个铁路工程师给指挥一下倒还可以，铲雪吗，你我都没有这个义务，规章上没有这么一条。那个老头子违法乱纪。我要告他。 \n \n 谁是这儿的工长？”他问身边的一个工人。 \n \n 保尔走上前去，问：“公民，您为什么不干活？” \n \n 那个男人轻蔑地把保尔从头到脚打量了一番。 \n \n “您是什么人？” \n \n “我是工人。” \n \n “那我跟您没什么可谈的。把工长给我叫来，别的领导也……” \n \n 保尔皱起眉头，白了他一眼，说：“不想干拉倒。火车票上没我们的签字，您就别想上车。这是工程队长的命令。” \n \n “您呢，女公民，也拒绝干活吗？”保尔转过身来问那个女人。一刹那间他呆住了：站在他面前的竟是冬妮亚·图曼诺娃。 \n \n 她好容易才认出这个像叫花子的人是保尔。一身破烂不堪的衣服，两只稀奇古怪的鞋子，脖子上围着一条脏毛巾，脸好久没有洗了——保尔就这副模样站在她面前。只有那一双眼睛，还同从前一样，炯炯发光。正是他的眼睛。就是这个像流浪汉一样衣衫褴褛的小伙子，不久以前还是她热恋的人。 \n \n 真是沧海桑田哪！ \n \n 她最近结了婚，现在同丈夫一起到一个大城市去。她丈夫在那里的铁路管理局担任重要职务。真想不到，她竟会在这种情况下遇见少年时代的恋人。她甚至没好意思同他握手。 \n \n 她的瓦西里会怎样想呢？保尔竟如此潦倒，真叫人心里不是滋味。看来，这个火夫一直没有什么长进，只能干个挖土的差事。 \n \n 她犹豫不决地站着，窘得双颊通红。那个铁路工程师气疯了，一个穷小子竟敢目不转睛地盯着他的妻子，他觉得实在太放肆了。他把锨往地下一扔，走到冬妮亚跟前，说：“咱们走，冬妮亚。这个拉查隆尼真叫人受不了，我实在看不下去。” \n \n 保尔读过《朱泽培·加里波第》这部小说，知道意大利语拉查隆尼是穷光蛋的意思。 \n \n “如果我是拉查隆尼，那你就是还没断气的资本家。”他粗声粗气地回敬了工程师一句，然后把目光转向冬妮亚，一字一句冷冷地说：“图曼诺娃同志，把锨拿起来，站到队伍里去吧。别学这个胖水牛的样。请原谅，我不知道他是您的什么人。” \n \n 保尔看着冬妮亚那双长统套靴，冷笑了一下，又顺便补充说：“我劝你们还是别留在这儿，前两天土匪还来光顾过呢。” \n \n 他转过身，拖着那只套鞋，啪哒啪哒地回自己人那里去了。 \n \n 最后这句话对工程师也发生了作用。 \n \n 冬妮亚终于说服了他一起去铲雪。 \n \n 傍晚收工之后，人们都向车站走去。冬妮亚的丈夫抢在前面，到火车上去占位子。冬妮亚停下来，让工人们先过去。 \n \n 走在最后面的是保尔，他拄着锨，已经非常疲乏。等他过来，冬妮亚和他并排走着，说：“你好，保夫鲁沙！坦白地说，我没想到你会弄成这个样子。难道你不能在政府里搞到一个比挖土强一点的差事吗？我还以为你早就当上了委员，或者委员一类的首长呢。你的生活怎么这样不顺心哪……” \n \n 保尔站住了，用惊奇的眼光打量着冬妮亚。 \n \n “我也没想到你会变得这么……酸臭。”保尔想了想，才找到了这个比较温和的字眼。 \n \n 冬妮亚的脸一下子红到了耳根。 \n \n “你还是这么粗鲁！” \n \n 保尔把木锨往肩上一扛，迈开大步向前走去。走了几步，他才回答说：“说句不客气的话，图曼诺娃同志，我的粗鲁比起您的彬彬有礼来，要好得多。我的生活用不着担心，一切都正常。但是您的生活，却比我原来想象的还要糟。两年前你还好一些，还敢跟一个工人握手。可现在呢，你浑身都是臭樟脑丸味。说实在的，我跟你已经没什么可谈的了。” \n \n 保尔收到了阿尔焦姆的来信。哥哥说最近就要结婚，要他无论如何回去一趟。 \n \n 风吹走了保尔手中的白信纸，它像鸽子一样飞向天空。他不能去参加婚礼。现在哪能离开工地呢？昨天，潘克拉托夫这头大熊已经赶过了他们小队，正在以令人目瞪口呆的速度前进。这个码头工人正在拼命争夺第一。他已经失去了惯有的沉静，不断鼓动他那些从码头上来的伙伴以疯狂的速度进行工作。 \n \n 帕托什金观察着这些筑路工人怎样一言不发地闷头苦干。他惊奇地搔着头皮，问自己：“这是些什么人哪？哪儿来的这股不可思议的力量呢？要是再这么晴上七八天，我们就可以铺到伐木场了。真是应了那句俗话：活到老，学到老，到老还是懂得少。这些人的工作打破了一切常规和定额。” \n \n 克拉维切克带着他亲手烤的最后一批面包从城里来了。 \n \n 见过托卡列夫之后，他在工地上找到了保尔。他俩亲热地互相问过好。接着，克拉维切克笑嘻嘻地从麻袋里拿出一件瑞典精制的黄面毛皮短大衣，拍了一下那富有弹性的皮面，说：“这是给你的。不知道是谁送的吧？……嗬！小伙子，你可真傻呀！这是丽达同志让带来的，怕把你这个傻瓜冻死。这件衣服是奥利申斯基同志送给她的，她刚从他手里接过来就交给我，说给保尔捎去吧。她听阿基姆说过，你穿着单衣在冰天雪地里干活。奥利申斯基皱了皱鼻子说：‘我可以给那位同志另送一件军大衣去。’但是，丽达笑着说，不用了，穿短的干活更方便，拿去吧！” \n \n 保尔惊异地拿起这件珍贵的礼物，过了一会儿，才犹犹豫豫地穿在冻得冰凉的身上。柔软的毛皮很快就使他的后背和前胸感到了温暖。 \n \n 丽达在日记里写道： \n \n １２月２０日 \n \n 连日暴风雪。今天仍然又是风，又是雪。博亚尔卡的筑路大军眼看就可以把路铺到目的地，但是他们被严寒和暴风雪阻住了。他们常常陷在没人深的积雪里。挖掘冻土是很困难的。只剩下四分之三公里了，但这是最困难的一段。 \n \n 托卡列夫报告说，工地上发现了伤寒，已经有三个人病倒了。 \n \n １２月２２日 \n \n 共青团省委召开全体会议，博亚尔卡没有人来参加。匪徒在离博亚尔卡十七公里的地方把一列运粮火车弄出轨了。 \n \n 按照粮食人民委员部全权代表的命令，工程队全体人员都调到出事地点去了。 \n \n １２月２３日 \n \n 又有七个伤寒病人从博亚尔卡送回城里。其中有奥库涅夫。我到车站去了。哈尔科夫开来一列火车，从车厢连接板上抬下来几具冻僵的尸体。医院里也很冷。该死的暴风雪！什么时候才能停呢？ \n \n １２月２４日 \n \n 刚从朱赫来那里回来。消息证实了：奥尔利克匪帮昨天夜里倾巢出动，袭击了博亚尔卡。我们的人跟他们打了两个小时。他们切断了电话线，所以直到今天早上，朱赫来才得到确实消息。匪徒被打退了。托卡列夫受了伤，胸部被打穿了。今天就能把他送回来。弗兰茨·克拉维切克被砍死了。他昨天夜里正好担任警卫队长。是他发现匪徒，发出了警报；他一边往回跑，一边阻击进攻的敌人，但是没有来得及跑到学校，就被砍死了。工程队有十一个人受伤。现在那里派去了一列装甲车和两中队骑兵。 \n \n 潘克拉托夫继任工程队长。今天，普济列夫斯基团在格卢博基村追上了一部分匪徒，把他们一个不留地全都砍死了。 \n \n 一部分非党非团干部，没有等火车，就沿着铁路离开了工地。 \n \n １２月２５日 \n \n 托卡列夫和其他伤员都已经送回，被安置在医院里。医生们保证把托卡列夫救活。他仍然昏迷不醒。其他人没有生命危险。 \n \n 省党委和我们都收到了博亚尔卡的来电：为了回答匪徒的袭击，我们，所有参加今天群众大会的轻便铁路建设者，同“保卫苏维埃政权号”装甲列车和骑兵团的全体指战员一起，向你们保证，我们将克服一切困难，在一月一日以前把木柴运到城里。我们决心全力以赴，完成任务。派遣我们的共产党万岁！大会主席柯察金。书记员别尔津。 \n \n 我们以军礼在索洛缅卡安葬了克拉维切克。 \n \n 日夜盼望的木柴已经近在眼前。但是筑路进度十分缓慢。 \n \n 伤寒每天都要夺去几十只有用的手。 \n \n 有一天，保尔两腿发软，像喝醉酒似的，摇摇晃晃地走回车站。他已经发烧好几天了，今天热度比哪天都高。 \n \n 吮吸工程队血液的肠伤寒也悄悄地向保尔进攻了。但是他那健壮的身体在抵抗着，接连五天，他都打起精神，奋力从铺着干草的水泥地上爬起来，和大家一起去上工。他身上穿着暖和的皮大衣，冻坏的双脚穿上了朱赫来送给他的毡靴，可是这些东西对他也无济于事了。 \n \n 他每走一步，都像有什么东西猛刺他的胸部，浑身发冷，上下牙直打架，两眼昏黑，树木像走马灯一样围着他打转。 \n \n 他好容易才走到车站。异常的喧哗声使他吃了一惊。仔细一看，站台旁边停着一列同车站一样长的平板车。上面载的是小火车头、铁轨和枕木，随车来的人正在卸车。他又向前走了几步，终于失去了平衡。他模模糊糊地感觉到头碰到地上，积雪冰着他那灼热的面颊，怪舒服的。 \n \n 几小时以后，才有人偶然发现了他，把他抬到板棚里。保尔呼吸困难，已经认不得周围的人了。从装甲车上请来的医生说，他是肠伤寒，并发大叶性肺炎。体温四十一度五。关节炎和脖子上的痈疮，就不值一提了，都算小病。肺炎加伤寒就足以把他送到另一个世界去了。 \n \n 潘克拉托夫和刚回来的杜巴瓦尽一切可能抢救保尔。 \n \n 他们托保尔的同乡阿廖沙·科汉斯基护送他回家乡去。 \n \n 只是在柯察金小队全体队员的帮助下，更主要是靠霍利亚瓦施加的压力，潘克拉托夫和杜巴瓦才把阿廖沙和不省人事的保尔塞进了挤得满满的车厢。车上的人怕斑疹伤寒传染，怎么也不肯让他们上车，并且威胁说，车开动后，就把病人扔下去。 \n \n 霍利亚瓦用转轮手枪指着那些不让病人上车的人的鼻子，喊道：“这个病人不传染！就是把你们全撵下车，也得让他走！ \n \n 你们这帮自私自利的家伙，记住，我马上通知沿线各站，要是谁敢动他一根毫毛，就把你们全都撵下车，扣起来。阿廖沙，这是保尔的毛瑟枪，给你拿着。谁敢动他，你就照准谁开枪。”霍利亚瓦最后又威胁地加上了这么一句。 \n \n 火车开走了。在空荡荡的站台上，潘克拉托夫走到杜巴瓦身旁，问：“你说，他能活吗？” \n \n 没有得到回答。 \n \n “走吧，德米特里，只好听其自然了。现在全部工作都得咱们俩负责了。今天连夜把机车卸下来，明天早上就试车。” \n \n 霍利亚瓦给沿线各站做肃反工作的朋友们打了电话，恳切地请求他们不要让乘客把柯察金弄下来，直到每个同志都回答“一定办到”之后，他才去睡觉。 \n \n 在一个铁路枢纽站的站台上，从一列客车的车厢里抬出来一个淡黄色头发的青年的尸体。他是谁，怎么死的——谁也不知道。站上的肃反工作人员想起霍利亚瓦的嘱托，赶忙跑到车厢跟前阻止，但是看到这个青年确实已经死了，就叫人把尸体抬到了停尸房。 \n \n 他们立刻打电话到博亚尔卡通知霍利亚瓦，说他让他们关照的那个同志已经去世了。 \n \n 博亚尔卡打了个简短的电报给省委，报告了保尔的死讯。 \n \n 阿廖沙·科汉斯基把重病的柯察金送到了家，接着，他自己也得了伤寒，发高烧，病倒了。 \n \n 丽达在日记上写着： \n \n １月９日 \n \n 我为什么这样难过呢？还没有拿起笔来，就哭了一场。谁能想到丽达会失声痛哭，还哭得这样伤心！难道眼泪一定是意志薄弱的表现吗？今天流泪是因为有一种难以抑制的悲痛。 \n \n 为什么悲痛会突然袭来呢？今天是大喜的日子，可怕的严寒已经被战胜，铁路各站堆满了宝贵的木柴，我又刚从祝捷大会——市苏维埃为祝贺筑路英雄们而召开的扩大会议——回来，为什么悲痛恰恰在这个时刻降临呢？我们是取得了胜利，但是，有两个人为此献出了生命：克拉维切克和保尔。 \n \n 保尔的死揭示了我内心的真情：对我来说，他比我原先所想的更珍贵。 \n \n 日记就记到这里吧，不知道哪天再提起笔来接着写。明天写信到哈尔科夫去，告诉他们我同意到乌克兰共青团中央委员会去工作。 \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/lizhi/16/234.html","bookId":327,"book":{"id":327,"title":"How The Steel Was Tempered
