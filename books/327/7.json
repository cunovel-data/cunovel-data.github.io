{"id":43659,"no":7,"title":"Part One Chapter 6","content":"A light shone in only one window of the big old house; the curtains were drawn. Outside Tresor,now chained for the night, suddenly barked in his reverberating bass. \\n\\n Through a sleepy haze Tonya heard her mother speaking in a low voice. \\n\\n \"No, she is not asleep yet. Come in, Liza.\" \\n\\n The light footsteps of her friend and the warm, impulsive hug finally dispelled her drowsiness.Tonya smiled wanly. \\n\\n \"I\u0027m so glad you\u0027ve come, Liza. Papa passed the crisis yesterday and today he has been sleepingsoundly all day. Mama and I have had some rest too after so many sleepless nights. Tell me all the news.\" Tonya drew her friend down beside her on the couch. \\n\\n \"Oh, there\u0027s plenty of news, but some of it\u0027s for your ears only,\" Liza smiled with a sly look at Yekaterina Mikhailovna. \\n\\n Tonya\u0027s mother smiled. She was a matronly woman of thirty-six with the vigorous movements of a young girl, clever grey eyes and a face that was pleasant if not beautiful. \"I will gladly leave you alone in a few minutes, but first I want to hear the news that is fit for everybody\u0027s ears,\" she joked, pulling a chair up to the couch. \\n\\n \"Well, to begin with we\u0027ve finished with school. The board has decided to issue graduation certificates to the seventh-graders. I am glad. I\u0027m so sick of all this algebra and geometry! What good is it to anyone? The boys may possibly continue their studies, although they don\u0027t know where, with all this fighting going on. It\u0027s simply terrible. . . . As for us, we\u0027ll be married and wives don\u0027t need algebra,\" Liza laughed. After sitting with the girls for a little while, Yekaterina Mikhailovna went to her own room. Liza now moved closer to Tonya and with her arms about her gave her a whispered account of the encounter at the crossroads. \\n\\n \"You can imagine my surprise, Tonya, when I recognised the lad who was running away. Guess who it was?\" \\n\\n Tonya, who was listening with interest, shrugged her shoulders. \\n\\n \"Korchagin!\" Liza blurted out breathlessly. \\n\\n Tonya started and winced. \\n\\n \"Korchagin?\" \\n\\n Liza, pleased with the impression she had made, went on to describe her quarrel with Victor. \\n\\n Carried away by her story, Liza did not notice Tonya\u0027s face grow pale and her fingers pluck nervously at her blue blouse. Liza did not know how Tonya\u0027s heart constricted with anxiety, nor did she notice how the long lashes that hid her beautiful eyes trembled. Tonya paid scant heed to Liza\u0027s story of the drunken Khorunzhy. One thought gave her no rest: \\n\\n \"Victor Leszczinski knows who attacked the soldier. Oh, why did Liza tell him?\" And in spite of herself the words broke from her lips. \\n\\n \"What did you say?\" Liza could not grasp her meaning at once. \\n\\n \"Why did you tell Leszczinski about Pavlusha . . . I mean Korchagin? He\u0027s sure to betray him. . . .\" \\n\\n \"Oh, surely not!\" Liza protested. \"I don\u0027t think he would do such a thing. After all, why should he?\" \\n\\n Tonya sat up sharply and hugged her knees so hard that it hurt. \\n\\n \"You don\u0027t understand, Liza! He and Korchagin are enemies, and besides, there is something else. . . . You made a big mistake when you told Victor about Pavlusha.\" \\n\\n Only now did Liza notice Tonya\u0027s agitation, and her use of Korchagin\u0027s first name confirmed what she had vaguely suspected. \\n\\n She could not help feeling guilty and lapsed into an embarrassed silence. \\n\\n \"So it\u0027s true,\" she thought. \"Fancy Tonya falling in love with a plain workman.\" Liza wanted to talk about it very much, but out of consideration for her friend she refrained. Anxious to atone for her guilt in some way, she seized Tonya\u0027s. \\n\\n \"Are you very worried, Tonya?\" \\n\\n \"No, perhaps Victor is more honourable than I think,\" Tonya replied absently. \\n\\n The awkward silence that ensued was broken by the arrival of a schoolmate of theirs, a bashful,gawky lad named Demianov. \\n\\n After seeing her friends off, Tonya stood for a long time leaning against the wicket gate and staring at the dark strip of road leading to town. The wind laden with a chill dampness and the dank odour of the wet spring soil fanned her face. Dull red lights blinked in the windows of the houses over in the town. There it was, that town that lived a life apart from hers, and somewhere there, under one of those roofs, unaware of the danger that threatened him, was her rebellious friend Pavel. Perhaps he had forgotten her—how many days had flown by since their last meeting? He had been in the wrong that time, but all that had long been forgotten. Tomorrow she \\n\\n would see him and their friendship would be restored, a moving, warming friendship. It was sure to return—of that Tonya had not the slightest doubt. If only the night did not betray him, the night that seemed to harbour evil, as if lying in wait for him. . . . A shiver ran through her, and after a last look at the road, she went in. The thought, \"If only the night does not betray him\", still drilled in her head as she dozed off. \\n\\n Tonya woke up early in the morning before anyone else was about, and dressed quickly. She slipped out of the house quietly so as not to wake up the family, untied the big shaggy Tresor and set out for town with the dog. She hesitated for a moment in front of the Korchagin house, then pushed the gate open and walked into the yard. Tresor dashed ahead wagging his tail. . . . \\n\\n Artem had returned from the village early that same morning. The blacksmith he had worked for had given him a lift into town on his cart. On reaching home he threw the sack of flour he had earned on his shoulders and walked into the yard, followed by the blacksmith carrying the rest of his belongings. Outside the open door Artem set the sack down on the ground and called out;\"Pavka!\" \\n\\n There was no answer. \\n\\n \"What\u0027s the hitch there? Why not go right in?\" said the smith as he came up. \\n\\n Setting his belongings down in the kitchen, Artem went into the next room. The sight that met his eyes there dumbfounded him: the place was turned upside down and old clothes littered the floor. \\n\\n \"What the devil is this?\" Artem muttered completely at a loss. \"It\u0027s a mess all right,\" agreed the blacksmith. \\n\\n \"Where\u0027s the boy got to?\" Artem was getting angry. But the place was deserted and dead. \\n\\n The blacksmith said good-bye and left. \\n\\n Artem went into the yard and looked around. \\n\\n \"I can\u0027t make head or tail of this! All the doors wide open and no Pavka.\" \\n\\n Then he heard footsteps behind him. Turning around he saw a huge dog with ears pricked standing before him. A girl was walking toward the house from the gate. \\n\\n \"I want to see Pavel Korchagin,\" she said in a low voice, surveying Artem. \\n\\n \"So do I. But the devil knows where he\u0027s gone. When I got here the house was unlocked and no Pavka anywhere about. So you\u0027re looking for him too?\" he addressed the girl. \\n\\n The girl answered with a question: \\n\\n \"Are you Korchagin\u0027s brother Artem?\" \\n\\n \"I am. Why?\" \\n\\n Instead of replying, the girl stared in alarm at the open door. \"Why didn\u0027t I come last night?\" she thought. \"It can\u0027t be, it can\u0027t be. . . .\" And her heart grew heavier still. \\n\\n \"You found the door open and Pavel gone?\" she asked Artem, who was staring at her in surprise. \\n\\n \"And what would you be wanting of Pavel, may I ask?\" Tonya came closer to him and casting a look around spoke jerkily: \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know for sure, but if Pavel isn\u0027t at home he must have been arrested.\" \\n\\n Artem started nervously. \"Arrested? What for?\" \\n\\n \"Let\u0027s go inside,\" Tonya said. \\n\\n Artem listened in silence while Tonya told him all she knew. By the time she had finished he was despairing. \\n\\n \"Damn it all! As if there wasn\u0027t enough trouble without this mess,\" he muttered gloomily. \"Now I see why the place was turned upside down. What the hell did the boy have to get mixed up in this business for. . . . Where can I find him now? And who may you be, miss?\" \\n\\n \"My father is forest warden Tumanov. I\u0027m a friend of Pavel\u0027s.\" \\n\\n \"I see,\" Artem said absently. \"Here I was bringing flour to feed the boy up, and now this. . . .\" \\n\\n Tonya and Artem looked at each other in silence. \\n\\n \"I must go now,\" Tonya said softly as she prepared to go. \"I hope you\u0027ll find him. I\u0027ll come back later.\" \\n\\n Artem gave her a silent nod. \\n\\n \\n\\n A lean fly just awakened from its winter sleep buzzed in a corner of the window. On the edge of an old threadbare couch sat a young peasant woman, her elbows resting on her knees and her eyes fixed blankly on the filthy floor. \\n\\n The Commandant, chewing a cigarette stuck in the corner of his mouth, finished writing on a sheet of paper with a flourish, and, obviously pleased with himself, added an ornate signature ending in a curlicue under the title \"Commandant of the town of Shepetovka, Khorunzhy\u0027\u0027. From the door came the clinking of spurs. The Commandant looked up. \\n\\n Before him stood Salomyga with a bandaged arm. \\n\\n \"Hullo, what\u0027s blown you in?\" the Commandant greeted him. \\n\\n \"Not a good wind, at any rate. Got my hand sliced to the bone by a Bogunets.\" ( Bogunets—a fighting man of the Red Army Regiment named after Bogun, the hero of the national liberation struggle waged by the Ukrainian people in the 17th century.) \\n\\n Ignoring the woman\u0027s presence Salomyga cursed violently. \\n\\n \"So what are you doing here? Convalescing?\" \\n\\n \"We\u0027ll have time to convalesce in the next world. They\u0027re pressing down pretty hard on us at the front.\" \\n\\n The Commandant interrupted him, nodding toward the woman. \\n\\n \"We\u0027ll talk about that later.\" \\n\\n Salomyga sat down heavily on a stool and removed his cap, which bore a cockade with an enamel trident, the emblem of the UNR (Ukrainian National Republic). \\n\\n \"Golub sent me,\" he began in a low tune. \"A division of regulars is going to be transferred here soon. In general there\u0027s going to be some doings in town, and it\u0027s my job to put things straight. The \u0027Chief himself may come here with some foreign bigwig or other, so there\u0027s to be no talk about any \u0027diversions\u0027. What\u0027re you writing?\" \\n\\n The Commandant shifted the cigarette to the other corner of his mouth. \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got a damn nuisance of a boy here. Remember that chap Zhukhrai, the one who stirred up the railway-men against us? Well, he was caught at the station.\" \\n\\n \"He was, eh? Go on,\" Salomyga pulled his stool closer. \\n\\n \"Well, that blockhead Omelchenko, the Station Commandant, sent him over escorted by a Cossack, and on the way the lad I\u0027ve got in here took the prisoner away from him in broad daylight. The Cossack was disarmed and got his teeth knocked out, and was left to whistle for his prisoner. Zhukhrai got away, but we managed to grab this fellow. Here you have it all down on paper,\" and he pushed a sheaf of sheets covered with writing toward Salomyga. \\n\\n The latter scanned through the report, turning over the sheets with his left hand. \\n\\n When he had finished, he looked at the Commandant. \\n\\n \"And so you got nothing out of him?\" \\n\\n The Commandant pulled nervously at the peak of his cap. \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been at him for five days now, but all he says is, \u0027I don\u0027t know anything and I didn\u0027t free him.\u0027 \\n\\n The young scoundrel! You see, the escort recognised him—practically choked the life out of him as soon as he saw him. I could hardly pull the fellow off—no wonder, he\u0027d good reason to be sore because Omelchenko at the station had given him twenty-five strokes with the cleaning rod for losing his prisoner. There\u0027s no sense in keeping him any more, so I\u0027m sending this off to headquarters for permission to finish him off.\" \\n\\n Salomyga spat in disdain. \\n\\n \"If I had him he\u0027d speak up sure enough. You\u0027re not much at conducting enquiries. Whoever heard of a theology student making a Commandant! Did you try the rod?\" \\n\\n The Commandant was furious. \\n\\n \"You\u0027re going a bit too far. Keep your sneers to yourself. I\u0027m the Commandant here and I\u0027ll ask you not to interfere.\" \\n\\n Salomyga looked at the bristling Commandant and roared with laughter. \\n\\n \"Ha-ha-ha. . . . Don\u0027t puff yourself up too much, priest\u0027s son, or you\u0027ll burst. To hell with you and your problems. Better tell me where a fellow can get a couple of bottles of samogon?\" \\n\\n The Commandant grinned. \\n\\n \"That s easy. \" \\n\\n \"As for this,\" Salomyga jabbed at the sheaf of papers with his finger, \"if you want to fix him properly put him down as eighteen years instead of sixteen. Round the top of six off like that. \\n\\n Otherwise they mightn\u0027t pass it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There were three of them in the storeroom. A bearded old man in a threadbare coat lay on his side on the bunk, his spindle legs in their wide linen trousers drawn up under him. He had been arrested because the horse of the Petlyura men billeted with him had been missing from the shed. \\n\\n An elderly woman with small shifty eyes and a pointed chin was sitting on the floor. She made her living by selling samogon and had been thrown in here on a charge of stealing a watch and other valuables. Korchagin lay semiconscious in the corner under the window, his head resting on his crushed cap. \\n\\n A young woman, in a peasant kerchief, her eyes wide with terror, was led into the storeroom. \\n\\n She stood for a moment or two and then sat down next to the samogon woman. \\n\\n \"Got caught, eh, wench?\" the latter spoke rapidly, inspecting the newcomer with curious eyes. \\n\\n There was no answer, but the samogon woman would not give up. \\n\\n \"Why\u0027d they pick you up, eh? Nothing to do with samogon by any chance?\" The peasant girl got up and looked at the persistent \"No, it\u0027s because of my brother,\" she replied quietly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And who\u0027s he?\" the old woman persisted. \\n\\n The old man spoke up. \\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you leave her alone? She\u0027s got enough to worry about without your chattering.\" \\n\\n The woman turned quickly toward the bunk. \\n\\n \"Who are you to tell me what to do? I\u0027m not talking to you, am I?\" \\n\\n The old man spat. \\n\\n \"Leave her alone, I tell you.\" \\n\\n Silence descended again on the storeroom. The peasant girl spread out a big shawl and lay down,resting her head on her arm. \\n\\n The samogon woman began to eat. The old man sat up, lowered his feet onto the floor, slowly rolled himself a cigarette and lit it. Clouds of acrid smoke spread out. \\n\\n \"A person can\u0027t eat in peace with that stink,\" the woman grumbled, her jaws working busily. \\n\\n \"You\u0027ve smoked the whole place up.\" \\n\\n The old man returned with a sneer: \\n\\n \"Afraid of losing weight, eh? You won\u0027t be able to get through the door soon. Why don\u0027t you give the boy something to eat instead of stuffing it all into yourself?\" \\n\\n The woman made an angry gesture. \\n\\n \"I tried, but he doesn\u0027t want anything. And as for that you can keep your mouth shut—it\u0027s not your food I\u0027m eating.\" \\n\\n The girl turned to the samogon woman and, nodding toward Korchagin, asked: \\n\\n \"What is he in here for?\" \\n\\n The woman brightened up at being addressed and readily replied: \\n\\n \"He\u0027s a local lad—Korchagin\u0027s younger boy. His mother\u0027s a cook.\" \\n\\n Leaning over to the girl, she whispered in her ear: \\n\\n \"He freed a Bolshevik—a sailor we had hereabouts .who used to lodge with my neighbour Zozulikha.\" \\n\\n The young woman remembered the words, she had overheard: \"I\u0027m sending this off to headquarters for permission to finish him off.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n One after the other troop trains pulled in at the junction, and battalions of regulars poured out in a disorderly mob. The armoured train Zaporozhets, four cars long, its steel sides ribbed with rivets,crawled along a side track. Guns were unloaded and horses were led out of closed box cars. The horses were saddled on the spot and mounted men jostled their way through the milling crowds of infantrymen to the station yard where the cavalry unit was lining up. \\n\\n Officers ran up and down, calling the numbers of their units. \\n\\n The station buzzed like a wasps\u0027 nest. Gradually the regular squares of platoons were hammered out of the shapeless mass of vociferous, swirling humanity and soon a stream of armed men was pouring into town. Until late in the evening carts creaked and rattled and the stragglers bringing up the rear of the rifle division trailed along the highway. \\n\\n The procession finally ended with the headquarters company marching briskly by, bellowing from a hundred and twenty throats: \\n\\n \\n\\n What\u0027s the shouting? \\n\\n What\u0027s the noise? \\n\\n It\u0027s Petlyura \\n\\n And his boys \\n\\n Come to town. .. . \\n\\n \\n\\n Pavel Korchagin got up to look out of the window. Through the early twilight he could hear the rumbling of wheels on the street, the tramping of many feet, and the lusty singing. \\n\\n Behind him a soft voice said: \\n\\n \"The troops have come to town.\" \\n\\n Korchagin turned round. \\n\\n The speaker was the girl who had been brought in the day before. \\n\\n He had already heard her story—the samogon woman had wormed it out of her. She came from a village seven versts from the town, where her elder brother, Gritsko, now a Red partisan, had headed a poor peasants\u0027 committee when the Soviets were in power. \\n\\n When the Reds left, Gritsko girded himself with a machine-gun belt and went with them. Now the family was being hounded incessantly. Their only horse had been taken away from them. The father had been imprisoned for a while and had a rough time of it. The village elder— one of those on whom Gritsko had clamped down—was always billeting strangers in their house, out of sheer spite. The family was destitute. And when the Commandant had come to the village the day before to make a search, the elder had brought him to the girl\u0027s place. She struck his fancy and the next morning he brought her to town with him \"for interrogation\". \\n\\n Korchagin could not fall asleep, try as he might he could not find rest, and in his brain drilled one insistent thought which he could not dispel: \"What next?\" \\n\\n His bruised body ached, for the guard had beaten him with bestial fury. \\n\\n To escape the bitter thoughts crowding his mind he listened to the whispering of the two women. \\n\\n In a barely audible voice the girl was telling how the Commandant had pestered her, how he had threatened and coaxed, and when she rebuffed him, turned on her in fury. \"I\u0027ll lock you up in a cellar and let you rot there,\" he had said. \\n\\n Darkness lurked in the corners of the cell. There was another night ahead, a stifling, restless night. \\n\\n It was the seventh night in captivity, but to Pavel it seemed that he had been there for months. The floor was hard, and pain racked his body. There were three of them now in the storeroom. The samogon woman had been released by the Khorunzhy to procure some vodka. Grandpa was snoring on the bunk as if he were at home on his Russian stove; he bore his misfortune with stoic calm and slept soundly through the night. Khristina and Pavel lay on the floor, almost side by side. \\n\\n Yesterday Pavel had seen Sergei through the window—he had stood for a long time out in the street, looking sadly at the windows of the houses. \\n\\n \"He knows I\u0027m here,\" Pavel had thought. \\n\\n For three days running someone had brought sour black bread for him—who it was the guards would not tell. And for two days the Commandant had repeatedly questioned him. \\n\\n What could it all mean? \\n\\n During the questioning he had given nothing away; on the contrary he had denied everything. \\n\\n Why he had kept silent, he did not know himself. He wanted to be brave and strong, like those of whom he had read in books, yet that night when he was being taken to prison and one of his captors had said, \"What\u0027s the use of dragging him along, Pan Khorunzhy? A bullet in the back will fix him\", he had been afraid. Yes, the thought of dying at sixteen was terrifying! Death was the end of everything. Khristina was also thinking. She knew more than the young man. Most likely he did not know yet what was in store for him . . . what she had overheard. \\n\\n He tossed about restlessly at night unable to sleep. Khristina pitied him, though the prospect she herself faced was hardly better—she could not forget the menace of the Commandant\u0027s words: \"I\u0027ll fix you up tomorrow— if you won\u0027t have me it\u0027s the guardhouse for you. The Cossacks will be glad to get you. So take your choice.\" Oh, how hard it was, and no mercy to be expected anywhere! Was it her fault that Gritsko had joined the Reds? How cruel life was! \\n\\n A dull pain choked her and in the agony of helpless despair and fear her body was racked by soundless sobs. A shadow moved in the corner by the wall. \"Why are you crying?\" \\n\\n In a passionate whisper Khristina poured out her woes to her silent cell mate. He did not speak,but laid his hand lightly on hers. \\n\\n \"They\u0027ll torture me to death, curse them,\" she whispered in terror, gulping down her tears. \\n\\n \"Nothing can save me.\" What could Pavel say to this girl? There was nothing to say. Life was crushing them both in an iron ring. \\n\\n Perhaps he ought to put up a fight when they came for her tomorrow? They\u0027d only beat him to death, or a sabre blow on the head would end it all. Wishing to comfort the distraught girl somehow, he stroked her hand tenderly. The sobbing ceased. At intervals the sentry at the entrance could be heard challenging a passer-by with the usual \"Who goes there?\" and then everything was quiet again. Grandpa was fast asleep. The interminable minutes crawled slowly by. Then, to his utter surprise, Pavel felt the girl\u0027s arms go around him and pull him toward her. \\n\\n \"Listen,\" hot lips were whispering, \"there is no escape for me: if it isn\u0027t the officer, it\u0027ll be those others. Take me, love, so that dog won\u0027t be the first to have me.\" \\n\\n \"What are you saying, Khristina!\" \\n\\n But the strong arms did not release him. Full, burning lips pressed down on his—they were hard to escape. The girl\u0027s words were simple, tender—and he knew why she uttered them. \\n\\n For a moment everything receded—the bolted door, the red-headed Cossack, the Commandant,the brutal beatings, the seven stifling, sleepless nights—all were forgotten, and only the burning lips and the face moist with tears existed. \\n\\n Suddenly he remembered Tonya. \\n\\n How could he forget her? Those dear, wonderful eyes. \\n\\n He mustered his strength and broke away from Khristina\u0027s embrace. He staggered to his feet like a drunken man and seized hold of the grill. Khristina\u0027s hands found him. \\n\\n \"Why, what is the matter?\" \\n\\n All her heart was in that question. He bent down to her and pressing her hands said: \\n\\n \"I can\u0027t, Khristina. You are so . . . good.\" He hardly knew what he was saying. \\n\\n He stood up again in the intolerable silence and went over to the bunk. Sitting down on the edge,he woke up the old man. \\n\\n \"Give me a smoke, please, Granddad.\" \\n\\n The girl, huddled in her shawl, wept in the corner. \\n\\n The next day the Commandant came with some Cossacks and took Khristina away. Her eyes sought Pavel\u0027s in farewell, and there was reproach in them. And when the door slammed behind her his soul was more desolate and dreary than ever. \\n\\n All day long the old man could not get a word out of Pavel. The sentries and the Commandant\u0027s guard were changed. Toward evening a new prisoner was brought in. Pavel recognised him: it was Dolinnik, a joiner from the sugar refinery, a short thickset man wearing a faded yellow shirt under a threadbare jacket. He surveyed the storeroom with a keen eye. \\n\\n Pavel had seen him in February 1917, when the reverberation of the revolution reached their town. \\n\\n He had heard only one Bolshevik speak during the noisy demonstrations held then and that Bolshevik was Dolinnik. He had climbed onto a roadside fence and addressed the troops. Pavel remembered his closing words: \\n\\n \"Follow the Bolsheviks, soldiers, they will not betray you!\" \\n\\n He had not seen the joiner since. \\n\\n Granddad was glad to have a new cell mate, for he obviously found it hard to sit silent all day long. Dolinnik settled down next to him on the edge of the bunk, smoked a cigarette with him and questioned him about everything. \\n\\n Then the newcomer moved over to Korchagin. \"Well, young man?\" he asked Pavel. \"And how did you get in here?\" \\n\\n Pavel replied in monosyllables and Dolinnik saw that it was caution that kept the young man from speaking. When he learned of the charge laid against Pavel his intelligent eyes widened with amazement and he sat down beside the lad. \\n\\n \"So you say you got Zhukhrai away? That\u0027s interesting. I didn\u0027t know they\u0027d nabbed you.\" \\n\\n Pavel, taken by surprise, raised himself on his elbow. \"I don\u0027t know any Zhukhrai. They can pin anything on you here.\" \\n\\n Dolinnik, smiling, moved closer to him. \"That\u0027s all right, my boy. You don\u0027t need to be cautious with me. I know more than you do.\" \\n\\n Quietly, so that the old man should not overhear he continued: \\n\\n \"I saw Zhukhrai off myself, he\u0027s probably reached his destination by now. He told me all about what happened.\" After a moment\u0027s pause, Dolinnik added: \"I see you\u0027re made of the right stuff,boy. Though, the fact that they caught you and know everything is bad, Very bad, I should say.\" \\n\\n He took off his jacket and spreading it on the floor sat down on it with his back against the wall,and began to roll another cigarette. \\n\\n Dolinnik\u0027s last remark made everything clear to Pavel. There was no doubt about it, Dolinnik was all right. Besides, he had seen Zhukhrai off, and that meant. . . . \\n\\n That evening he learned that Dolinnik had been arrested for agitation among Petlyura\u0027s Cossacks. \\n\\n Moreover, he had been caught distributing an appeal issued by the gubernia revolutionary committee calling on the troops to surrender and go over to the Reds. \\n\\n \\n\\n Dolinnik was careful not to tell Pavel much. \\n\\n \"Who knows,\" he thought to himself, \"they may use the ramrod on the boy. He\u0027s still too young.\" \\n\\n Late at night when they were settling themselves for sleep, he voiced his apprehensions in the brief remark: \\n\\n \"Well, Korchagin, we seem to be in a pretty bad fix. Let\u0027s see what will come of it.\" \\n\\n The next day a new prisoner was brought in—the flop-eared, scraggy-necked barber Shlyoma Zeltser. \\n\\n \"Fuchs, Bluvstein and Trachtenberg are going to welcome him with bread and salt,\" he told Dolinnik gesturing excitedly as he spoke. \"I said that if they want to do that, they can, but will the rest of the Jewish population back them up? No, they won\u0027t, you can take it from me. Of course they have their own fish to fry. Fuchs has a store and Trachtenberg\u0027s got the flour mill. But what\u0027ve I got? And the rest of the hungry lot? Nothing—paupers, that\u0027s what we are. Well, I\u0027ve got a long tongue, and today when I was shaving an officer—one of the new ones who came recently —I said: \u0027Do you think Ataman Petlyura knows about these pogroms or not? Will he see the \\n\\n delegation?\u0027 Oi, how many times I\u0027ve got into trouble through this tongue of mine. So what do you think this officer did when I had shaved him and powdered his face and done all in fine style too? He gets up and instead of paying me arrests me for agitating against the authorities.\" Zeltser struck his chest with his fist. \"Now what sort of agitation was that? What did I say? I only asked the fellow. . . . And to lock me up for that. . . .\" \\n\\n In his excitement Zeltser twisted a button on Dolinnik\u0027s shirt and tugged at his arms. \\n\\n Dolinnik smiled in spite of himself as he listened to the indignant Shlyoma. \\n\\n \"Yes, Shlyoma,\" he said gravely when the barber had finished, \"that was a stupid thing for a clever fellow like you to do. You chose the wrong time to let your tongue run away with you. I wouldn\u0027t have advised you to get in here.\" \\n\\n Zeltser nodded understandingly and made a gesture of despair with his hand. Just then the door opened and the samogon woman was pushed in. She staggered in, heaping foul curses on the Cossack who brought her. \\n\\n \"You and your Commandant ought to be roasted on a slow fire! I hope he shrivels up and croaks from that booze of mine!\" \\n\\n The guard slammed the door shut and they heard him locking it on the outside. \\n\\n As the woman settled down on the edge of the bunk the old man greeted her jocularly: \\n\\n \"So you\u0027re back with us again, you old chatterbox? Sit down and make yourself at home.\" \\n\\n The samogon woman darted a hostile glance at him and picking up her bundle sat down on the floor next to Dolinnik. \\n\\n It turned out that she had been released just long enough for her captors to get some bottles of samogon out of her. \\n\\n Suddenly shouts and the sound of running feet could be heard from the guardroom next door. \\n\\n Somebody was barking out orders. The prisoners stopped talking to listen. \\n\\n \\n\\n Strange things were happening on the square in front of the ungainly church with the ancient belfry. On three sides the square was lined with rectangles of troops— units of the division of regular infantry mustered in full battle kit. \\n\\n In front, facing the entrance to the church, stood three regiments of infantry in squares placed in checkerboard fashion, their ranks buttressed against the school fence. \\n\\n This grey, rather dirty mass of Petlyura soldiers standing there with rifles at rest, wearing absurd Russian helmets like pumpkins cut in half, and heavily laden down with bandoliers, was the best division the \"Directorate\" had. \\n\\n Well-uniformed and shod from the stores of the former tsarist army and consisting mainly of kulaks who were consciously fighting the Soviets, the division had been transferred here to defend this strategically important railway junction. Five different railway lines converged at Shepetovka,and for Petlyura the loss of the junction would have meant the end of everything. As it was, the \"Directorate\" had very little territory left in its hands, and the small town of Vinnitsa was now Petlyura\u0027s capital. \\n\\n The \"Chief Ataman\" himself had decided to inspect the troops and now everything was in readiness for his arrival. \\n\\n Back in a far corner of the square where they were least likely to be seen stood a regiment of new recruits— barefoot youths in shabby civilian clothes of all descriptions. These were farm lads picked up from their beds by midnight raiding parties or seized on the streets, and none of them had the least intention of doing any fighting. \\n\\n \"Let them look for fools somewhere else,\" they said. \\n\\n The most the Petlyura officers could do was to bring the recruits to town under escort, divide them into companies and battalions and issue them arms. The very next day, however, a third of the recruits thus herded together would disappear and with each passing day their numbers dwindled. \\n\\n It would have been more than foolhardy to issue them boots, particularly since the boot stocks were far from plentiful. And so everyone was ordered to report for conscription shod. The result was an astonishing collection of dilapidated footwear tied on with bits of string and wire. \\n\\n They were marched out for parade barefoot. \\n\\n Behind the infantry stood Golub\u0027s cavalry regiment. \\n\\n Mounted men held back the dense crowds of curious townsfolk who had come to see the parade. \\n\\n After all, the \"Chief Ataman\" himself was to be present! Events like this were rare enough in town and no one wanted to miss the free entertainment it promised. \\n\\n On the church steps were gathered the colonels and captains, the priest\u0027s two daughters, a handful of Ukrainian schoolteachers, a group of \"free Cossacks\", and the slightly hunchbacked mayor—in a word, the elite representing the \"public\", and among them the Inspector-General of Infantry wearing a Caucasian cherkesska. It was he who was in command of the parade. \\n\\n Inside the church Vasili, the priest, was garbing himself in his Easter service vestments. \\n\\n Petlyura was to be received in grand style. For one thing, the newly-mobilised recruits were to take the oath of allegiance, and for this purpose a yellow-and-blue flag had been brought out. \\n\\n The Division Commander set out for the station in a rickety old Ford car to meet Petlyura. \\n\\n When he had gone, the Inspector of Infantry called over Colonel Chernyak, a tall, well-built officer with a foppishly twirled moustache. \\n\\n \"Take someone along with you and see that the Commandant\u0027s office and the rear services are in proper shape. If you find any prisoners there look them over and get rid of the riffraff.\" \\n\\n Chernyak clicked his heels, took along the first Cossack captain his eye lighted on and galloped off. \\n\\n The Inspector turned politely to the priest\u0027s elder daughter. \\n\\n \"What about the banquet, everything in order?\" \\n\\n \"Oh, yes. The Commandant\u0027s doing his best,\" she replied, gazing avidly at the handsome Inspector. \\n\\n Suddenly a stir passed through the crowd: a rider was coming down the road at a mad gallop,bending low over the neck of his horse. He waved his hand and shouted: \\n\\n \"They\u0027re coming!\" \\n\\n \"Fall in!\" barked the Inspector. \\n\\n The officers ran to their places. \\n\\n As the Ford chugged up to the church the band struck up The Ukraine Lives On. \\n\\n Following the Division Commander, the \"Chief Ataman\" heaved himself laboriously out of the car. Petlyura was a man of medium height, with a square head firmly planted on a red bull neck;he wore a blue tunic of fine wool cloth girded tight with a yellow belt to which a small Browning in a chamois holster was attached. On his head was a peaked khaki uniform cap with a cockade bearing the enamel trident. \\n\\n There was nothing especially warlike about the figure of Simon Petlyura. As a matter of fact, he did not look like a military man at all. \\n\\n He heard out the Inspector\u0027s report with an expression of displeasure on his face. Then the mayor addressed him in greeting. \\n\\n Petlyura listened absently, staring at the assembled regiments over the mayor\u0027s head. \\n\\n \"Let us begin,\" he nodded to the Inspector. \\n\\n Mounting the small platform next to the flag, Petlyura delivered a ten-minute speech to the troops. \\n\\n The speech was unconvincing. Evidently tired from the journey, the Ataman spoke without enthusiasm. He finished to the accompaniment of the regulation shouts of \"Slava! Slava!\" from the soldiers and climbed down from the platform dabbing his perspiring forehead with a handkerchief. Then, together with the Inspector and the Division Commander, he inspected the units. \\n\\n As he passed the ranks of the newly-mobilised recruits his eyes narrowed in a disdainful scowl and he bit his lips in annoyance. \\n\\n Toward the end of the inspection, when the platoons of new recruits marched in uneven ranks to the flag, where the priest Vasili was standing, Bible in hand, and kissed first the Bible and then the hem of the flag, an unforeseen incident occurred. \\n\\n A delegation which had contrived by some unknown means to reach the square approached Petlyura. At the head of the group came the wealthy timber merchant Bluvstein with an offering of bread and salt, followed by Fuchs the draper, and three other well-to-do businessmen. \\n\\n With a servile bow Bluvstein extended the tray to Petlyura. It was taken by an officer standing alongside. \\n\\n \"The Jewish population wishes to express its sincere gratitude and respect for you, the head of the state. Please accept this address of greeting.\" \\n\\n \"Good,\" muttered Petlyura, quickly scanning the sheet of paper. \\n\\n Fuchs stepped forward. \\n\\n \"We most humbly beg you to allow us to open our enterprises and we ask for protection against pogroms.\" Fuchs stumbled over the last word. \\n\\n An angry scowl darkened Petlyura\u0027s features. \\n\\n \"My army does not engage in pogroms. You had better remember that.\" \\n\\n Fuchs spread out his arms in a gesture of resignation. \\n\\n Petlyura\u0027s shoulder twitched nervously. The untimely appearance of the delegation irritated him. \\n\\n He turned to Golub, who was standing behind chewing his black moustache. \\n\\n \"Here\u0027s a complaint against your Cossacks, Pan Colonel. Investigate the matter and take measures accordingly,\" said Petlyura. Then, addressing the Inspector, he said dryly: \\n\\n \"You may begin the parade.\" \\n\\n The ill-starred delegation had not expected to run up against Golub and they hastened to withdraw. \\n\\n The attention of the spectators was now wholly absorbed by the preparations for the ceremonial march-past. Sharp commands were rapped out. \\n\\n Golub, his features outwardly calm, walked over to Bluvstein and said in a loud whisper: \\n\\n \"Get out of here, you rotten heathens, or I\u0027ll make mincemeat out of you!\" \\n\\n The band struck up and the first units marched through the square. As they drew alongside Petlyura, the troops bellowed a mechanical \"Slava!\" and then swung down the highway to disappear into the sidestreets. At the head of the companies, uniformed in brand-new khaki outfits,the officers marched at an easy gait as if they were simply taking a stroll, swinging their swagger sticks. The swagger stick mode, like cleaning rods for the soldiers, had just been introduced in the division. \\n\\n The new recruits brought up the rear of the parade. They came in a disorderly mass, out of step and jostling one another. \\n\\n There was a low rustle of bare feet as the mobilised men shuffled by, prodded on by the officers who worked hard but in vain to bring about some semblance of order. When the second company was passing a peasant lad in a linen shirt on the side nearest the reviewing stand gaped in such wide-eyed amazement at the \"Chief\" that he stepped into a hole in the road and fell flat on the ground. His rifle slid over the cobblestones with a loud clatter. He tried to get up but was knocked down again by the men behind him. \\n\\n Some of the spectators burst out laughing. The company broke ranks and passed through the square in complete disorder. The luckless lad picked up his rifle and ran after the others. \\n\\n Petlyura turned away from this sorry spectacle and walked over to the car without waiting for the end of the review. The Inspector, who followed him, asked diffidently: \\n\\n \"Pan the Ataman will not stay for dinner?\" \\n\\n \"No,\" Petlyura flung back curtly. \\n\\n Sergei Bruzzhak, Valya and Klimka were watching the parade in the crowd of spectators pressed against the high fence surrounding the church. Sergei, gripping the bars of the grill, looked at the faces of the people below him with hatred in his eyes. \\n\\n \"Let\u0027s go, Valya, they\u0027ve shut up shop,\" he said in a deliberately loud defiant voice, and turned away from the fence. People stared at him in astonishment. \\n\\n Ignoring everyone, he walked to the gate, followed by his sister and Klimka. \\n\\n \\n\\n Colonel Chernyak and the Captain galloped up to the Commandant\u0027s office and dismounted. \\n\\n Leaving the horses in the charge of a dispatch rider they strode rapidly into the guardhouse. \\n\\n \"Where\u0027s the Commandant?\" Chernyak asked the dispatch rider sharply. \\n\\n \"Dunno,\" the man stammered. \"Gone off somewhere.\u0027\u0027 \\n\\n Chernyak looked around the filthy, untidy room, the unmade beds and the Cossacks of the Commandant\u0027s guard who sprawled on them and made no attempt to rise when the officers entered. \\n\\n \"What sort of a pigsty is this?\" Chernyak roared. \"And who gave you permission to wallow about like hogs?\" he lashed at the men lying flat on their backs. \\n\\n One of the Cossacks sat up, belched and growled: \\n\\n \"What\u0027re you squawking for? We\u0027ve got our own squawker here.\" \\n\\n \"What!\" Chernyak sprang toward the man. \"Who do you think you\u0027re talking to, you bastard? I\u0027m Colonel Chernyak. D\u0027you hear, you swine! Up, all of you, or I\u0027ll have you flogged!\" The enraged Colonel dashed about the guardhouse. \"I\u0027ll give you one minute to sweep out the filth, straighten out the bedding and make your filthy mugs presentable. You look like a band of brigands, not Cossacks!\" \\n\\n Beside himself with rage, the Colonel violently kicked at a slop pail obstructing his path. \\n\\n The Captain was no less violent, and, adding emphasis to his curses by wielding his three-thonged whip, drove the men out of their bunks. \\n\\n \"The Chief Ataman\u0027s reviewing the parade. He\u0027s liable to drop in here any minute. Get a move on there!\" \\n\\n Seeing that things were taking a serious turn and that they really might be in for a flogging—they knew Chernyak\u0027s reputation well enough—the Cossacks sprang into feverish activity. \\n\\n In no time work was in full swing. \\n\\n \"We ought to have a look at the prisoners,\" the Captain suggested. \"There\u0027s no telling whom they\u0027ve got locked up here. Might be trouble if the Chief looks in.\" \\n\\n \"Who has the key?\" Chernyak asked the sentry. \"Open the door at once.\" \\n\\n A Sergeant jumped up and opened the lock. \\n\\n \"Where\u0027s the Commandant? How long do you think I\u0027m going to wait for him? Find him at once and send him in here,\" Chernyak ordered. \"Muster the guard in the yard! Why are the rifles without bayonets?\" \\n\\n \"We only took over yesterday,\" the Sergeant tried to explain, and hurried off in search of the Commandant. \\n\\n The Captain kicked the storeroom door open. Several of the people inside got up from the floor,the others remained motionless. \\n\\n \"Open the door wider,\" Chernyak commanded. \"Not enough light here.\" \\n\\n He scrutinised the prisoners\u0027 faces. \\n\\n \"What are you in for?\" he snapped at the old man sitting on the edge of the bunk. \\n\\n The old man half rose, hitched up his trousers and, frightened by the sharp order, mumbled: \\n\\n \"Dunno myself. They just locked me up and here I am. There was a horse disappeared from the yard, but I\u0027ve got nothing to do with it.\" \\n\\n \"Whose horse?\" the Captain interrupted him. \\n\\n \"An army horse, of course. My billets sold him and drank the proceeds and now they\u0027re blaming me.\" \\n\\n Chernyak ran his eye swiftly over the old man and with an impatient jerk of his shoulder shouted: \\n\\n \"Pick up your things and get out of here!\" Then he turned to the samogon woman. \\n\\n The old man could not believe his ears. Blinking his shortsighted eyes, he turned to the Captain: \\n\\n \"Does that mean I can go?\" \\n\\n The Cossack nodded as much as to say: the faster you get out the better. \\n\\n Hurriedly the old man seized his bundle which hung over the edge of the bunk and dashed through the door. \\n\\n \"And what are you in for?\" Chernyak was questioning the samogon woman. \\n\\n Swallowing the mouthful of pie she had been chewing, the woman rattled off a ready answer: \\n\\n \"It\u0027s an injustice it is that I should be in here, Pan Chief. Just think of it, to drink a poor widow\u0027s samogon and then lock her up.\" \\n\\n \"You\u0027re not in the samogon business, are you?\" Chernyak asked. \\n\\n \"Business? Nothing of the kind,\" said the woman with an injured air. \"The Commandant came and took four bottles and didn\u0027t pay a kopek. That\u0027s how it is: they drink your booze and never pay. \\n\\n You wouldn\u0027t call that business, would you?\" \\n\\n \"Enough. Now go to the devil!\" \\n\\n The woman did not wait for the order to be repeated. She picked up her basket and backed to the door, bowing in gratitude. \\n\\n \"May God bless you with good health, your honours.\" \\n\\n Dolinnik watched the comedy with frank amazement. \\n\\n None of the prisoners could make out what it was all about. The only thing that was clear was that the arrivals were chiefs of some kind who had the power to dispose of them as they saw fit. \\n\\n \"And you there?\" Chernyak spoke to Dolinnik. \\n\\n \"Stand up when Pan the Colonel speaks to you!\" barked the Captain. \\n\\n Slowly Dolinnik raised himself to his feet from the floor. \\n\\n \"What are you in for?\" Chernyak repeated. \\n\\n Dolinnik looked at the Colonel\u0027s neatly twirled moustache, at his clean-shaven face, looked at the peak of his new cap with the enamel cockade, and a wild thought flashed through his mind: \\n\\n Maybe it\u0027ll work! \\n\\n \"I was arrested for being out on the streets after eight o\u0027clock,\" he said, blurting out the first thing that came into his head. \\n\\n He awaited the answer in an agony of suspense. \\n\\n \"What were you doing out at night?\" \\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t night, only about eleven o\u0027clock.\" \\n\\n He no longer believed that this shot in the dark would succeed. \\n\\n His knees trembled when he heard the brief command: \\n\\n \"Get out.\" \\n\\n Dolinnik walked hurriedly out of the door, forgetting his jacket; the Captain was already questioning the next prisoner. \\n\\n Korchagin was the last to be interrogated. He sat on the floor\u0027 completely dumbfounded by the proceedings. At first he could not believe that Dolinnik had been released. Why were they letting everyone off like this? But Dolinnik . . . Dolinnik had said that he had been arrested for breaking the curfew. . . . Then it dawned upon him. \\n\\n The Colonel began questioning the scraggy Zeltser with the usual \"What are you in for?\" \\n\\n The barber, pale with nervousness, blurted out: \\n\\n \"They tell me I was agitating, but I don\u0027t know what they\u0027re talking about.\" \\n\\n Chernyak pricked up his ears. \\n\\n \"What\u0027s that? Agitation? What were you agitating about?\" \\n\\n Zeltser spread out his arms in bewilderment. \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know myself, I only said that they were collecting signatures to a petition to the Chief Ataman for the Jewish population.\" \\n\\n \"What sort of petition?\" both Chernyak and the Captain moved menacingly toward Zeltser. \\n\\n \"A petition asking that pogroms be prohibited. You know, we had a terrible pogrom. The whole population\u0027s afraid. \\n\\n \"That\u0027s enough,\" Chernyak interrupted him. \"We\u0027ll give you a petition you won\u0027t forget, you dirty Jew.\" Turning to the Captain, he snapped: \"Put this one away properly. Have him taken to headquarters—I\u0027ll talk to him there personally. We\u0027ll see who\u0027s behind this petition business.\" \\n\\n Zeltser tried to protest but the Captain struck him sharply across the back with his riding crop. \\n\\n \"Shut up, you bastard!\" \\n\\n His face twisted with pain, Zeltser staggered back into a corner. His lips trembled and he barely restrained his sobs. \\n\\n While this was going on, Pavel rose to his feet. He was now the only prisoner besides Zeltser in the storeroom. \\n\\n Chernyak stood in front of the boy and inspected him with his piercing black eyes. \\n\\n \"Well, what are you doing here?\" \\n\\n Pavel had his answer ready. \\n\\n \"I cut off a saddle skirt for soles,\" he said quickly. \\n\\n (\"What saddle?\" the Colonel asked. \\n\\n \"We\u0027ve got two Cossacks billeted at our place and I cut off a bit of an old saddle to sole my boots with. So the Cossacks hauled me in here.\" Seized by a wild hope to regain his freedom, he added: \\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t know it wasn\u0027t allowed. . . .\" \\n\\n The Colonel eyed Pavel with disgust. \\n\\n \"Of all the things this Commandant thought of, blast him! Look at the prisoners he picked up!\" As he turned to the door, he shouted: \"You can go home, and tell your father to give you the thrashing you deserve. Out with you!\" \\n\\n Still unable to believe his ears, Pavel snatched up Dolinnik\u0027s jacket from the floor and rushed for the door, his heart pounding as if it would burst. He ran through the guardroom and slipped outside behind the Colonel who was walking out into the yard. In a moment Pavel was through the wicket gate and in the street. \\n\\n The unlucky Zeltser remained alone in the storeroom. He looked round with harassed eyes,instinctively took a few steps towards the exit, but just then a sentry entered the guardhouse,closed the door, inserted the padlock, and sat down on a stool next to the door. \\n\\n Out on the porch Chernyak, much pleased with himself, said to the Captain: \\n\\n \"It\u0027s a good thing we looked in. Think of the rubbish we found there—we\u0027ll have to lock up that Commandant for a couple of weeks. Well, it\u0027s time we were going.\" \\n\\n The Sergeant had mustered his detail in the yard. When he saw the Colonel, he ran over and reported: \\n\\n \"Everything\u0027s in order, Pan Colonel.\" \\n\\n Chernyak inserted a boot into a stirrup and sprang lightly into the saddle. The Captain was having some trouble with his restive horse. Reining in his mount, the Colonel said to the Sergeant: \\n\\n \"Tell the Commandant I cleared out all the rubbish he\u0027d collected in there. And tell him I\u0027ll give him two weeks in the guardhouse for the way he ran things here. As for the fellow in there now,transfer him to headquarters at once. Let the guard be in readiness.\" \\n\\n \"Very good, Pan Colonel,\" said the Sergeant and saluted. \\n\\n Spurring on their horses, the Colonel and the Captain galloped back to the square where the parade was already coming to an end. \\n\\n \\n\\n Pavel swung himself over another fence and stopped exhausted. He could go no farther. Those days cooped up in the stifling storeroom without food had sapped his strength. \\n\\n Where should he go? Home was out of the question, and to go to the Bruzzhaks might bring disaster upon the whole family if anyone discovered him there. \\n\\n He did not know what to do, and ran on again blindly, leaving behind the vegetable patches and back gardens at the edge of the town. Colliding heavily with a fence, he came to himself with a start and looked about him in amazement: there behind the tall fence was the forest warden\u0027s garden. So this was where his weary legs had brought him! He could have sworn that he had had no thought of coming this way. How then did he happen to be here? For that he could find no answer. \\n\\n Yet rest awhile he must; he had to consider the situation and decide on the next step. He remembered that there was a summerhouse at the end of the garden. No one would see him there. \\n\\n Hoisting himself to the top of the fence, he clambered over and dropped into the garden below. \\n\\n With a brief glance at the house, barely visible among the trees, he made for the summerhouse. To his dismay he found that it was open on nearly all sides. The wild vine that had walled it in during the summer had withered and now all was bare. \\n\\n He turned to go back, but it was too late. There was a furious barking behind him. He wheeled round and saw a huge dog coming straight at him down the leaf-strewn path leading from the house. Its fierce growls rent the stillness of the garden. \\n\\n Pavel made ready to defend himself. The first attack he repulsed with a heavy kick. But the animal crouched to spring a second time. There is no saying how the encounter would have ended had a familiar voice not called out: \"Come here, Tresor! Come here!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Tonya came running down the path. She dragged Tresor back by the collar and turned to address the young man standing by the fence. \\n\\n \"What are you doing here? You might have been badly mauled by the dog. It\u0027s lucky I. . . .\" \\n\\n She stopped short and her eyes widened in surprise. How extraordinarily like Korchagin was this stranger who had wandered into her garden. \\n\\n The figure by the fence stirred. \\n\\n \"Tonya!\" said the young man softly. \"Don\u0027t you recognise me?\" \\n\\n Tonya cried out and rushed impulsively over to him. \\n\\n \"Pavel, you?\" \\n\\n Tresor, taking the cry as a signal for attack, sprang forward. \\n\\n \"Down, Tresor, down!\" A few cuffs from Tonya and he slunk back with an injured air toward the house, his tail between his legs. \\n\\n \"So you\u0027re free?\" said Tonya, clinging to Pavel\u0027s hands. \\n\\n \"You knew then?\" \\n\\n \"I know everything,\" replied Tonya breathlessly. \"Liza told me. But however did you get here? \\n\\n Did they let you go?\" \\n\\n \"Yes, but only by mistake,\" Pavel replied wearily. \"I ran away. I suppose they\u0027re looking for me now. I really don\u0027t know how I got here. I thought I\u0027d rest a bit in your summerhouse. I\u0027m awfully tired,\" he added apologetically. \\n\\n She gazed at him for a moment or two and a wave of pity and tenderness swept over her. \\n\\n \"Pavel, my darling Pavel,\" she murmured holding his hands fast in hers. \"I love you. . . . Do you hear me? My stubborn boy, why did you go away that time? Now you\u0027re coming to us, to me. I shan\u0027t let you go for anything. It\u0027s nice and quiet in our house and you can stay as long as you like.\" \\n\\n Pavel shook his head. \\n\\n \"What if they find me here? No, I can\u0027t stay in your place.\" \\n\\n Her hands squeezed his fingers and her eyes flashed. \\n\\n \"If you refuse, I shall never speak to you again. Artem isn\u0027t here, he was marched off under escort to the locomotive. All the railwaymen are being mobilised. Where will you go?\" \\n\\n Pavel shared her anxiety, and only his fear of bringing trouble to this girl now grown so dear to him held him back. But at last, worn out by his harrowing experiences, hungry and exhausted, he gave in. \\n\\n While he sat on the sofa in Tonya\u0027s room, the following conversation ensued between mother and daughter in the kitchen. \\n\\n \"Mama, Korchagin is in my room. He was my pupil, you remember? I don\u0027t want to hide anything from you. He was arrested for helping a Bolshevik sailor to escape. Now he has run away from prison, but he has nowhere to go.\" Her voice trembled. \"Mother dear, please let him stay here for a while.\" \\n\\n The mother looked into her daughter\u0027s pleading eyes. \\n\\n \"Very well, I have no objection. But where do you intend to put him?\" \\n\\n Tonya flushed. \\n\\n \"He can sleep in my room on the sofa,\" she said. \"We needn\u0027t tell Papa anything for the time being.\" \\n\\n Her mother looked straight into her eyes. \\n\\n \"Is this what you have been fretting about so much lately?\" she asked. \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \"But he is scarcely more than a boy.\" \\n\\n \"I know,\" replied Tonya, nervously fingering the sleeve of her blouse. \"But if he hadn\u0027t escaped they would have shot him just the same.\" \\n\\n Yekaterina Mikhailovna was alarmed by Korchagin\u0027s presence in her home. His arrest and her daughter\u0027s obvious infatuation with a lad she scarcely knew disturbed her. \\n\\n But Tonya, considering the matter settled, was already thinking of attending to her guest\u0027s comfort. \\n\\n \"He must have a bath, first thing, Mama. I\u0027ll see to it at once. He is as dirty as a chimney sweep. It must be ages since he had a wash.\" \\n\\n And she bustled off to heat the water for the bath and find some clean linen for Pavel. When all was ready she rushed into the room, seized Pavel by the arm and hurried him off to the bathroom without more ado. \\n\\n \"You must have a complete change of clothes. Here is a suit for you to put on. Your things will have to be washed. You can wear that in the meantime,\" she said pointing to the chair where a blue sailor blouse with striped white collar and a pair of bell-bottomed trousers were neatly laid out. \\n\\n Pavel looked surprised. Tonya smiled. \\n\\n \"I wore it at a masquerade ball once,\" she explained. \"It will be just right for you. Now, hurry. \\n\\n While you\u0027re washing, I\u0027ll get you something to eat.\" \\n\\n She went out and shut the door, leaving Pavel with no alternative but to undress and climb into the tub. \\n\\n An hour later all three, mother, daughter and Pavel, were dining in the kitchen. \\n\\n Pavel, who was ravenously hungry, consumed three helpings before he was aware of it. He was rather shy of Yekaterina Mikhailovna at first but soon thawed out when he saw how friendly she was. \\n\\n After dinner they retired to Tonya\u0027s room and at Yekaterina Mikhailovna\u0027s request Pavel related his experiences. \\n\\n \"What do you intend doing now?\" Yekaterina Mikhailovna asked when he had finished. \\n\\n Pavel pondered the question a moment. \"I should like to see Artem first, and then I shall have to get away from here.\" \\n\\n \"But where will you go?\" \\n\\n \"I think I could make my way to Uman or perhaps to Kiev. I don\u0027t know myself yet, but I must get away from here as soon as possible.\" \\n\\n Pavel could hardly believe that everything had changed so quickly. Only that morning he had been in the filthy cell and now here he was sitting beside Tonya, wearing clean clothes, and, what was most important, he was free. \\n\\n What queer turns life can take, he thought: one moment the sky seems black as night, and then the sun comes shining through again. Had it not been for the danger of being arrested again he would have been the happiest lad alive at this moment. \\n\\n But he knew that even in this large, silent house he was far from safe. He must go away from here,it did not matter where. And yet he did not at all welcome the idea of going away. How thrilling it had been to read about the heroic Garibaldi! How he had envied him! But now he realised that Garibaldi\u0027s must have been a hard life, hounded as he was from place to place. He, Pavel, had only lived through seven days of misery and torment, yet it had seemed like a whole year. \\n\\n No, clearly he was not cut out to be a hero. \\n\\n \"What are you thinking about?\" Tonya asked, bending over toward him. The deep blue of her eyes seemed fathomless. \\n\\n \"Tonya, shall I tell you about Khristina?\" \\n\\n \"Yes, do,\" Tonya urged him. \\n\\n He told her the sad story of his fellow-captive. \\n\\n The clock ticked loudly in the silence as he ended his story: \".. .And that was the last we saw of her,\" his words came with difficulty. Tonya\u0027s head dropped and she had to bite her lips to force back the tears. \\n\\n Pavel looked at her. \"1 must go away tonight,\" he said with finality. \\n\\n \"No, no, 1 shan\u0027t let you go anywhere tonight.\" \\n\\n She stroked his bristly hair tenderly with her slim warm fingers. . . . \\n\\n \"Tonya, you must help me. Someone must go to the station and find out what has happened to Artem and take a note to Seryozha. I have a revolver hidden in a crow\u0027s nest. I daren\u0027t go for it, but Seryozha can get it for me. Will you be able to do this for me?\" \\n\\n Tonya got up. \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll go to Liza Sukharko right away. She and I will go to the station together. Write your note and I\u0027ll take it to Seryozha. Where does he live? Shall I tell him where you are if he should want to see you?\" \\n\\n Pavel considered for a moment before replying. \"Tell him to bring the gun to your garden this evening.\" \\n\\n It was very late when Tonya returned. Pavel was fast asleep. The touch of her hand awoke him and he opened his eyes to find her standing over him, smiling happily. \\n\\n \"Artem is coming here soon. He has just come back. Liza\u0027s father has agreed to vouch for him and they\u0027re letting him go for an hour. The engine is standing at the station. I couldn\u0027t tell him you are here. I just told him I had something very important to tell him. There he is now!\" \\n\\n Tonya ran to open the door. Artem stood in the doorway dumb with amazement, unable to believe his eyes. Tonya closed the door behind him so that her father, who was lying ill with typhus in the study, might not overhear them. \\n\\n Another moment and Artem was giving Pavel a bear\u0027s hug that made his bones crack, and crying: \\n\\n \"Pavel! My little brother!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And so it was decided: Pavel was to leave the next day. Artem would arrange for Bruzzhak to take him on a train bound for Kazatin. \\n\\n Artem, usually grave and reserved, was now almost beside himself with joy at having found his brother after so many days of anxiety and uncertainty. \\n\\n \"Then it\u0027s settled. Tomorrow morning at five you\u0027ll be at the warehouse. While they\u0027re loading on fuel you can slip in. I wish I could stay and have a chat with you but I must be getting back. I\u0027ll see you off tomorrow. They\u0027re making up a battalion of railwaymen. We go about under an armed escort just like when the Germans were here.\" \\n\\n Artem said good-bye to his brother and left. \\n\\n Dusk gathered fast, Sergei would be arriving soon with the revolver. While he waited, Pavel paced nervously up and down the dark room. Tonya and her mother were with the forest warden. \\n\\n He met Sergei in the darkness by the fence and the two friends shook hands warmly. Sergei had brought Valya with him. They conversed in low tones. \\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t brought the gun,\" Sergei said. \"That backyard of yours is thick with Petlyura men. There are carts standing all over the place and they had a bonfire going. So I couldn\u0027t climb the tree to get the gun. It\u0027s a damn shame.\" Sergei was much put out. \\n\\n \"Never mind,\" Pavel consoled him. \"Perhaps it\u0027s just as well. It would be worse if I happened to be caught on the way with the gun. But make sure you get hold of it.\" \\n\\n Valya moved closer to Pavel. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When are you leaving?\" \\n\\n \"Tomorrow, at daybreak.\" \\n\\n \"How did you manage to get away? Tell us.\" \\n\\n In a rapid whisper Pavel told them his story. Then he took leave of his comrades. The jolly Sergei was unusually silent. \\n\\n \"Good luck, Pavel, don\u0027t forget us,\" Valya said in a choking voice. \\n\\n And with that they left him, the darkness swallowing them up in an instant. \\n\\n Inside the house all was quiet. The measured ticking of the clock was the only sound in the stillness. \\n\\n For two of the house\u0027s inmates there was no thought of sleep that night. How could they sleep when in six hours they were to part, perhaps never to meet again. Was it possible in that brief space of time to give utterance to the myriad of unspoken thoughts that seethed within them? \\n\\n Youth, sublime youth, when passion, as yet unknown, is only dimly felt in a quickening of the pulse; when your hand coming in chance contact with your sweetheart\u0027s breast trembles as if affrighted and falters, and when the sacred friendship of youth guards you from the final step! \\n\\n What can be sweeter than to feel her arm about your neck and her burning kiss on your lips. \\n\\n It was the second kiss they had exchanged throughout their friendship. Pavel, who had experienced many a beating but never a caress except from his mother, was stirred to the depths of his being. Hitherto life had shown him its most brutal side, and he had not known it could be such a glorious thing; now this girl had taught him what happiness could mean. \\n\\n He breathed the perfume of her hair and seemed to see her eyes in the darkness. \\n\\n \"I love you so, Tonya, I can\u0027t tell you how much, for I don\u0027t know how to say it.\" \\n\\n His brain was in a whirl. How responsive her supple body. . . . But youth\u0027s friendship is a sacred trust. \\n\\n \"Tonya, when all this mess is over I\u0027m bound to get a job as a mechanic, and if you really want me, if you\u0027re really serious and not just playing with me, I\u0027ll be a good husband to you. I\u0027ll never beat you, never do anything to hurt you, I swear it.\" \\n\\n Fearing to fall asleep in each other\u0027s arms—lest Tonya\u0027s mother find them and think ill of them—they separated. \\n\\n Day was breaking when they fell asleep after having made a solemn compact never to forget one another. \\n\\n Yekaterina Mikhailovna woke Pavel early. He jumped quickly out of bed. While he was in the bathroom, putting on his own clothes and boots, with Dolinnik\u0027s jacket on top, Yekaterina Mikhailovna woke Tonya. \\n\\n They hurried through the grey morning mist to the station. When they reached the timber yards by the back way they found Artem waiting impatiently for them beside the loaded tender. \\n\\n A powerful engine moved up slowly, enveloped in clouds of hissing steam. Bruzzhak looked out of the cab. \\n\\n Pavel bid Tonya and Artem a hasty farewell, then gripped the iron rail and climbed up into the engine. Looking back he saw two familiar figures at the crossing: the tall figure of Artem and the small graceful form of Tonya beside him. The wind tore angrily at the collar of her blouse and tossed her chestnut hair. She waved to him. \\n\\n Artem glanced at Tonya out of the corner of his eye and noticing that she was on the verge of tears, he sighed. \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be damned if there isn\u0027t something up between these two,\" he said to himself. \"And me thinking Pavel is still a little boy!\" \\n\\n When the train disappeared behind the bend he turned to Tonya and said: \"Well, shall we be friends?\" And Tonya\u0027s tiny hand was lost in his huge paw. \\n\\n From the distance came the rumble of the train gathering speed. \\n\\n \\n\\n 古老的大房子，只有一个挂着窗帘的窗子透出灯光。院子里，用铁链拴着的狗——特列佐尔突然狺狺狂吠起来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 冬妮亚在睡意矇眬中听到母亲的低语声：“冬妮亚还没睡。进来吧，莉莎。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 女友轻轻的脚步声和她那亲切热烈的拥抱把冬妮亚的睡意完全驱散了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 冬妮亚面带倦容，微笑着。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “莉莎，你来得太好了。我们全家都很高兴，因为爸爸昨天已经脱离了危险期，今天他安安静静地睡了一整天。我和妈妈熬了好几夜，今天也休息了一下。莉莎，有什么新闻，都讲给我听听。”冬妮亚把莉莎拉到身旁，在长沙发上坐下来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “新闻吗，倒是很多！不过有一些我只能对你一个人讲。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 莉莎一边笑，一边调皮地望着冬妮亚的母亲叶卡捷林娜·米哈伊洛夫娜。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 冬妮亚的母亲也笑了。她是一个落落大方的妇人，虽然已经三十六岁了，举止却仍然像年轻姑娘那样轻盈。她有一双聪明的灰眼睛，容貌虽然不出众，却很有精神，惹人喜欢。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “好吧，过一会儿我就让你们俩单独谈。现在您先把能公开的新闻说一说吧。”她开着玩笑，一面把椅子挪到沙发跟前。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “第一件新闻是：我们再也不用上学了。校务会议已经决定给七年级学生发毕业证书。我高兴极了。”莉莎眉飞色舞地说。“那些代数呀，几何呀，简直烦死我了！为什么要学这些东西呢？男同学也许还能继续上学，不过到哪儿去上，他们自己也不知道。到处都是战场，各地都在打仗。真可怕！…… \\n\\n \\n\\n 我们反正得出嫁，做妻子的懂代数有什么用？”莉莎说到这里，大声笑起来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 叶卡捷林娜·米哈伊洛夫娜陪姑娘们坐了一会儿，回到自己的房间里去了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 莉莎往冬妮亚跟前挪了挪，搂着她，低声给她讲了十字路口发生的事情。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “冬妮亚，你想想，当我认出那个逃跑的人的时候，我是多么吃惊啊！……你猜那人是谁？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 冬妮亚正听得出神，她莫名其妙地耸了耸肩膀。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 莉莎脱口而出：“是柯察金！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 冬妮亚战栗了一下，痛苦地缩作一团。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “是柯察金？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 莉莎对自己的话产生的效果很得意，接着就讲开了她同维克托吵嘴的经过。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 她只顾讲话，没有发现冬妮亚的脸色已经变得煞白，纤细的手指神经质地摆弄着蓝上衣的衣襟。莉莎完全不知道，冬妮亚是多么惊慌，连心都缩紧了。她也不知道，冬妮亚那美丽的浓密的睫毛为什么那样紧张地抖动。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 莉莎后来又讲到那个喝醉酒的警备司令的事，冬妮亚已经完全顾不上听了，她脑子里只有一个想法：“维克托已经知道是谁袭击了押送兵。莉莎为什么要告诉他呢？”她不知不觉把这句话说了出来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “我告诉什么啦？”莉莎没有明白她的意思，这样问。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “你为什么要把保夫鲁沙，我是说，把柯察金的事情告诉维克托呢？你要知道，维克托会出卖他的……” \\n\\n \\n\\n 莉莎反驳说：“不会的。我看他不会。这么做对他究竟有什么好处呢？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 冬妮亚猛然坐直了身子，两手使劲抓住膝盖，抓得生疼。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “你呀，莉莎，什么也不明白！维克托跟柯察金本来就是仇人，何况又加上别的原因……你把保夫鲁沙的事情告诉维克托，是做了一件大错事。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 莉莎到这时才发现冬妮亚很着急。冬妮亚脱口说出“保夫鲁沙”这样亲昵的称呼，使她终于弄明白了她一向模模糊糊猜测着的事情。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 莉莎不禁也觉得自己做错了事，感到难为情，不再做声了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 她想：“看来，真有这么回事了。真怪，冬妮亚怎么会突然爱上了他？他是个什么人呢？一个普普通通的工人……”莉莎很想同她谈谈这件事，但是怕失礼，没有开口。为了设法弥补自己的过失，她拉住冬妮亚的两只手，说：“冬妮亚，你很担心吗？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 冬妮亚精神恍惚地回答：“不，也许维克托比我想象的要好一些。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 不一会儿，她们的同班同学杰米亚诺夫来了，他是个笨手笨脚的、朴实的小伙子。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 杰米亚诺夫到来之前，她们俩怎么也谈不到一起了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 冬妮亚送走了两个同学，独自在门口站了很久。她倚着栅栏门，凝视着通向城里的那条灰暗的大道。到处游荡永不停息的风，夹着潮湿的寒气和春天的霉味，向冬妮亚吹来。远处，城里许多房子的窗户不怀好意地闪着暗红的灯光。那就是她所恼恨的小城。在城里的一间房屋里，住着她那个不安生的朋友，他恐怕还不知道大祸就要临头了。也许他已经把她忘了。自从上次见面以后，又过去了多少天哪！那一次是他不对，不过这件事她早就淡忘了。明天她一见到他，往日的友谊，那使人激动的美好的友谊，就会恢复。他们一定会言归于好，这一点冬妮亚深信不疑。但愿这一夜平安无事。然而这不祥的黑夜，仿佛在一旁窥伺着，随时准备……真冷啊。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 冬妮亚朝大路瞥了最后一眼，回到了屋里。她躺在床上，裹着被子，临睡前还思念着：黑夜，可千万不要出卖他呀！…… \\n\\n \\n\\n 清晨，家里的人还都在熟睡，冬妮亚就醒来了。她迅速穿好衣服。为了不惊醒别人，她悄悄地走到院子里，解开长毛大狗特列佐尔，领着它向城里走去。在柯察金家对面，她犹豫不决地站了片刻。随后，推开栅栏门，走进了院子。特列佐尔摇着尾巴，跑在前面。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 阿尔焦姆刚好也在这天清晨从乡下回到家里。他是坐大车来的，同车的是一个一起干活的铁匠师傅。他把挣来的一袋面粉扛在肩上，走进院子。铁匠拿着其他东西跟在后面。阿尔焦姆走到敞开的屋门口，放下面粉，喊了一声：“保尔！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 没有人应声。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “呆在这儿干吗，搬到屋里去吧！”铁匠走到跟前说。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 阿尔焦姆把东西放在厨房里，进了屋，一看就愣住了。屋里翻得乱七八糟，破破烂烂的东西扔得满地都是。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “真见鬼！”阿尔焦姆莫名其妙，转身对铁匠说。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “可不是吗，太乱了。”铁匠附和着。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “这小东西跑到哪儿去了？”阿尔焦姆开始生气了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 但是，屋里空空的，要打听都没人好问。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 铁匠告别后，赶着大车走了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 阿尔焦姆走到院子里，仔细看了看周围的情况。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “真不明白，这是搞的什么名堂！房门大开着，保尔却不在家。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 这时，背后传来了脚步声。阿尔焦姆转过身来。一条大狗竖着耳朵站在他面前。还有一个陌生的姑娘进了栅栏门，朝屋子走来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “我找保尔·柯察金。”她打量着阿尔焦姆，轻声地说。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “我也正找他呢。谁知道他跑到哪儿去了！我刚刚回来，房门开着，家里没人。您找他有事吗？”他问姑娘。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 姑娘没有回答，反问了他一句：“您是保尔·柯察金的哥哥阿尔焦姆吧？” \\n\\n \\n\\n “是啊，有什么事吗？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 姑娘仍然没有回答，只是忧虑地望着敞开的门。“我怎么昨天晚上不来呢？难道出事了？是真的？……”她的心情更沉重了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “您回来的时候，门就敞着，就没见到保尔吗？”她向惊奇地注视着她的阿尔焦姆问道。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “您找保尔到底有什么事？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 冬妮亚走到阿尔焦姆跟前，向周围看了看，急促地说：“我也说不准确，不过，要是保尔没在家，那他就是被捕了。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “因为什么？”阿尔焦姆不由得打了一个寒噤。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “咱们到屋里谈吧。”冬妮亚说。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 阿尔焦姆一声不响地听她讲着。当冬妮亚把她知道的一切全都告诉了他之后，他异常沮丧。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “唉，真是糟糕！本来就够受的了，偏偏又碰上倒霉事……”他愁眉苦脸地咕哝着。“这就清楚了，为什么家里搞得这样乱糟糟的。这孩子是鬼迷心窍了，惹出这种事来……现在上哪儿去找他？请问，您是谁家的小姐？” \\n\\n \\n\\n “我是林务官图曼诺夫的女儿。我认识保尔。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “哦——哦……是这样……”阿尔焦姆含含糊糊地拖长声音说。“我给这孩子送面粉来了，想不到出了这种事……” \\n\\n \\n\\n 冬妮亚和阿尔焦姆你看着我，我看着你，谁也没有再做声。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “我要走了。您也许能找到他。”冬妮亚在向阿尔焦姆告别的时候轻声说。“晚上我再来听您的信。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 阿尔焦姆默默地点了点头。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 冬眠醒来的一只干瘪的苍蝇在窗角嗡嗡地叫着。一个农村姑娘，胳膊支着膝盖，坐在破旧沙发的边上，呆呆地望着肮脏的地板。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 警备司令嘴角上叼着一支香烟，龙飞凤舞地写完最后几行字，然后在“舍佩托夫卡警备司令哥萨克少尉”几个字下面，得意地签了名，名字写得很花哨，最后一笔还甩了一个钩。这时，门口传来了马刺的响声。警备司令抬起头来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 站在他面前的是萨洛梅加，一只胳膊缠着绷带。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “哪阵风把你给吹来了？”警备司令欢迎他说。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “风倒是好风，就是胳膊给博贡团［博贡团，１９１８年建立的乌克兰著名红军团队。——译者］打穿了。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 萨洛梅加不顾有妇女在场，粗野地破口大骂起来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “这么说，你是到这儿养伤来了？” \\n\\n \\n\\n “下辈子再养吧！前线吃紧，我们都快给压扁了。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 警备司令朝姑娘那边扬了扬头，示意他不要再讲下去。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “咱们以后再谈吧！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 萨洛梅加一屁股坐在凳子上，摘下了军帽。帽子上有一个三叉戟的珐琅帽徽，这是乌克兰人民共和国国徽。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “是戈卢勃派我来的。”他小声地说。“谢乔夫狙击师就要来驻防。你这儿可要大大麻烦了，我先来把秩序整顿一下。大头目也可能来，还有一位洋大人跟他一起来，所以，这儿谁也不许提起那次‘消遣’的事。你写什么呢？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 警备司令把香烟叼到另一边嘴角上，说：“我这儿关着一个小坏蛋。你知道吧，我们在车站抓住了那个朱赫来，你大概记得，就是煽动铁路工人反对咱们的那个人。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “记得，他怎么啦？”萨洛梅加很感兴趣地往前凑了凑。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “你知道，驻站警备队长奥梅利琴科这个笨蛋，只派了一个哥萨克往我们这儿押送。就是我这儿现在关着的这个小坏蛋，公然在大白天把朱赫来劫走了。他俩抢走了哥萨克的枪，打掉了他好几颗牙，一溜烟跑掉了。朱赫来跑得无影无踪，那个小坏蛋却叫我们抓住了。材料就在这儿，你看看吧。”他把一份写好的公文推到萨洛梅加面前。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 萨洛梅加用没有受伤的左手翻着材料，草草看了一遍。然后两眼盯着警备司令，问：“你从他嘴里什么也没问出来吗？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 警备司令烦躁地扯了扯帽檐。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “我整了他五天，他什么也不说。老是一句话：‘我什么也不知道，不是我放的。’简直是天生的土匪。你知道，那个押送的哥萨克认出了这个小坏蛋，差点把他掐死。我费了好大劲才把他拉开。他因为跑了犯人，在车站挨了奥梅利琴科二十五通条，所以一见这小坏蛋，就狠狠揍了他一顿。现在这个人没必要再关下去了，我给上司写个呈文，上头一批，就把他干掉。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 萨洛梅加轻蔑地吐了一口唾沫，说：“他要是落在我手里，保管早就招了。审犯人这种事，你这个小神甫根本干不了。神学院的学生，怎么能当司令呢？你没用通条抽他吗？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 警备司令发火了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “你也太放肆了。还是嘲笑嘲笑你自己吧！我是这儿的司令，你少管闲事！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 萨洛梅加瞧了瞧怒气冲冲的警备司令，哈哈大笑起来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “哈哈！……小神甫，别生气，当心气破了肚皮。我才不管你的事呢！闲话少说，你还是告诉我，哪儿能搞到两瓶好酒喝喝吧！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 警备司令得意地笑了笑：“这好办。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “这小子，”萨洛梅加用手指了指公文说。“你想要他的命，就得把十六岁改成十八岁，把‘６’字上面的小钩往这边一弯，就行了，要不，上头说不定不批。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 仓库里一共关押着三个人。一个是大胡子老头，他穿着破长袍和肥大的麻布裤子，蜷着两条瘦腿，侧身躺在板床上。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他被抓来是因为住在他家的佩特留拉士兵，有一匹马拴在他家板棚里不见了。地上坐着一个上了年纪的女人，贼眉鼠眼，尖下巴，是个酿私酒的。她是因为有人告她偷了表和其他贵重物品给抓来的。在窗子下面的角落里，头枕着帽子，昏昏沉沉地躺着的是保尔·柯察金。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 仓库里又带进来一个姑娘，她睁着两只惊恐不安的大眼睛，头上扎着花头巾，一副农村打扮。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 她站了一会儿，就坐到了酿私酒的女人身旁。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 酿私酒的老太婆把新来的姑娘仔细打量了一番，连珠似地问：“小姑娘，你也来坐牢啦？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 她没有得到回答，不肯罢休，又问：“你是为啥给抓来的？兴许也是为造私酒吧？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 农村姑娘站起来，看了看这个纠缠不休的老太婆，低声回答说：“不是的。我是为哥哥的事给抓来的。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “你哥哥怎么啦？”老太婆非要问出个究竟来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这时候，那个老头插嘴了：“你干吗惹她伤心呢？说不定人家够难受的了，可你问起来没个完。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 老太婆立刻转过身来，朝着板床那边说：“谁指派你来教训我的？我是跟你说话吗？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 老头啐了一口唾沫，说：“我是说，你别老缠着人家。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 仓库里安静下来。姑娘把大头巾铺在地上，枕着一只胳膊躺下了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 酿私酒的女人开始吃起东西来。老头把脚垂到地上，不慌不忙地卷了一支烟，抽起来。一股难闻的烟味立即在仓库里扩散开来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 老太婆嘴里塞得满满的，吧嗒吧嗒地嚼着，又唠叨起来：“抽起来没完没了，臭得要命。就不能让人吃顿安生饭？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 老头嘿嘿一笑，挖苦她说：“你是怕饿瘦了吗？眼看连门都挤不出去了。你就不兴给那个小伙子吃点？别总往自己嘴里塞。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 老太婆抱屈地把手一摆，说：“我紧着跟他说：你吃，吃吧，他不想吃嘛！能怨我吗？我吃多少，用不着你多嘴多舌的，又不是吃你的。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 姑娘朝老太婆转过身来，向柯察金那边扬了扬头，问：“您知道他为什么坐牢吗？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 老太婆一见有人跟她说话，心里高兴起来，乐呵呵地告诉姑娘：“他是本地人，是老妈子柯察金娜的小儿子。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 她弯下身子，凑到姑娘耳朵跟前，悄声说：“他救走了一个布尔什维克，那个人是水兵，就住在我的邻居佐祖利哈家。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 姑娘这时想起了警备司令的话：“我给上司写个呈文，上头一批，就把他干掉……” \\n\\n \\n\\n 军车一列接着一列开来，塞满了车站。谢乔夫狙击师所属各个分队（营）乱哄哄地从车上挤下来。由四节包着钢板的车厢组成的“扎波罗什哥萨克号”装甲车，缓慢地在铁路线上爬行。从平板车上卸下了大炮。从货车里牵出了马匹。骑兵们就地整鞍上马，挤开那群乱得不成队形的步兵，到车站广场上去集合整队。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 军官们跑来跑去，喊着自己部队的番号。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 车站上十分嘈杂，像有一窝蜂在嗡嗡地叫。纷乱的人群，逐渐按着班、排组成了队伍。随后，这股武装的人流就朝城里涌去。直到傍晚，谢乔夫师的辎重马车和后勤人员还络绎不绝地顺着公路开进城去。殿后的司令部警卫连终于也开过去了。一百二十个人一面走，一面扯着嗓子唱： \\n\\n \\n\\n 为什么喧哗？ \\n\\n \\n\\n 为什么呐喊？ \\n\\n \\n\\n 因为佩特留拉 \\n\\n \\n\\n 来到了乌克兰…… \\n\\n \\n\\n 保尔起身站到小窗跟前。街上车轮的辘辘声、杂乱的脚步声和歌声，透过苍茫的暮色，传入他的耳内。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他背后有人小声说：“看样子是军队开进城来了。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 保尔转过身来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 说话的是昨天关进来的那个姑娘。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他听过姑娘讲述自己的身世——那个酿私酒的老太婆终于达到了目的。原来姑娘就住在离城七俄里的农村。她哥哥格里茨科是个红色游击队员，当地成立苏维埃政权的时候，领导过贫农委员会。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 红军撤退的时候，格里茨科也缠上机枪子弹带，跟着他们走了。现在家里简直生活不下去。仅有的一匹马，也给抢走了。父亲被抓到城里，关进监牢，受尽了折磨。村长过去挨过格里茨科的斗，现在借机报复，经常把各式各样的人派到她家去住，弄得她家更穷了。前天警备司令到村里抓人，村长把他领到了她家。警备司令看中了这个姑娘，第二天清晨就把她带回城里来“审问”。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 保尔睡不着觉。他辗转反侧，一个无法摆脱的思想纠缠着他：“以后会怎么样？”这个问题总在脑子里翻腾。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 遭到毒打的身体像针扎一样疼痛。那天哥萨克押送兵兽性大发，把他狠狠地打了一顿。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 为了摆脱那些恼人的思想，他开始静听身旁两个妇女的低语。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 姑娘的声音非常小，她讲到警备司令怎样缠住她不放，又是威逼，又是利诱，遭到拒绝之后，又怎样暴跳如雷，说：“我把你关到地牢里，你一辈子也别想出去！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 黑暗吞噬着牢房的每一个角落。令人窒息的、不安的夜降临了。思路又转到吉凶未卜的明天。这只是第七夜，但是却好像已经熬过了好几个月。睡在硬邦邦的地上，全身疼痛不止。仓库里现在只剩下三个人了。老头躺在板床上打着呼噜，就像睡在自家的热炕上一样。这老爷子对眼前的处境满不在乎，夜夜都睡得又香又甜。酿私酒的老太婆被警备司令哥萨克少尉放出去弄烧酒去了。赫里斯季娜和保尔都躺在地上，离得很近。保尔昨天从窗口看见谢廖沙在街上站了很久，忧郁地盯着这座房子的窗户。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “看样子，他知道我关在这儿。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 一连三天都有人送来发酸的黑面包。是谁送来的，没有说。这两天警备司令又连着提审他。这是怎么回事呢？ \\n\\n \\n\\n 拷问的时候，保尔什么也没有说，一问三不知。连他自己也不知道为什么能不做声。他曾想做一个勇敢的人，坚强的人，像书里写的那样。可是被捕的那天夜里，他被押解着走过高大的机器磨坊时，听见一个匪兵说：“少尉大人，干吗还把他带回去？从背后给他一枪不就完了？”当时，他却又害怕起来。是啊，十六岁就死掉，这多可怕！死了，就再也活不成啦！ \\n\\n \\n\\n 赫里斯季娜也在想心事。她比这个小伙子知道得多一些。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他大概还不知道……而她已经听到了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 保尔没有睡，他一连几夜都翻来覆去睡不着。赫里斯季娜很同情他，唉，他太可怜了。然而她也有自己的苦处：她忘不了警备司令威胁她的话：“我明天再找你算帐。要是你再不依我，我就把你交给卫兵。那些哥萨克是求之不得的。你看着办吧！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 唉！真难哪！谁能来救她呢？哥哥当红军去了，妹妹有什么罪过？“唉！这个世道实在没法过！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 难言的痛苦哽住了她的喉咙，无可奈何的绝望和恐惧涌上了心头，她失声啜泣起来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 年轻姑娘的身躯由于过度悲愤和绝望而不住地抽搐着。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 墙角里的身影动了一下，问：“你这是怎么啦？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 赫里斯季娜激动地低声讲起来——她尽情向身旁这个沉默寡言的难友倾吐自己的痛苦。他听着，什么话也没有说，只是把一只手放在赫里斯季娜的手上。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “这些该死的畜生，他们一定会糟蹋我的。”赫里斯季娜吞咽着眼泪，怀着一种下意识的恐惧，小声地说。“我是完了：刀把子在他们手里呀。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 他保尔能对这个姑娘说些什么呢？他找不出适当的话来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 没有什么可说的。生活的铁环把人箍得紧紧的。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 明天不让他们带走她，跟他们拼吗？他们会把他打个半死，甚至会用马刀劈他的头——一下子也就完了。为了多少给这个满腹苦水的姑娘一些安慰，他温柔地抚摸着她的手。她不再哭泣了。大门口的哨兵像办例行公事似的，时而向过路的人喊一声：“什么人？”然后又是一阵寂静。老头还在沉睡。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 时间不知不觉地溜过去。当一双手突然紧紧搂住他，把他拉过去的时候，他一下子还不明白是怎么一回事。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “亲爱的，你听我说，”姑娘那热烈的嘴唇小声地说。“我反正是完了：不是那个当官的，就是那帮当兵的，一定会糟蹋我的。我把我这姑娘家的身子给你吧，亲爱的小伙子，我不能让那个畜生来破身。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “赫里斯季娜，你说些什么呀？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 但是，那双有力的手臂仍然紧紧搂住他不放。两片热烈的、丰满的嘴唇，简直无法摆脱。姑娘的话是那样简单明白，那样温柔多情，他完全理解她讲这番话的心意。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 眼前的一切顿时都不见了。牢门上的大锁，红头发的哥萨克，凶恶的警备司令，惨无人道的拷打，以及七个令人窒息的不眠之夜，都从记忆中消失了，这一瞬间只剩下了热烈的嘴唇和泪痕未干的脸庞。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 突然，他想起了冬妮亚。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “怎么能把她忘了呢？……那双秀丽的、可爱的眼睛。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 他终于找到了自制的力量。他像喝醉了酒似的站起来，抓住了窗上的铁栏杆。赫里斯季娜的两只手摸到了他。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “你怎么不来呢？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 这问话里包含着多少情意呀！他俯下身来，紧握住她的双手，说：“我不能这样，赫里斯季娜，你太好啦。”他还说了一些他自己也不懂的话。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他直起腰来。为了打破这难堪的沉寂，他走到板床跟前，坐在床沿上，推醒老头，说：“老大爷，给我点烟抽。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 赫里斯季娜裹着头巾，在角落里痛哭起来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 第二天，警备司令领着几个哥萨克来了，带走了赫里斯季娜。她用眼睛向保尔告别，眼神里流露出对他的责备。牢门在姑娘身后砰的一声关上了。保尔的心情也就变得更加沉重，更加郁悒。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 一直到天黑，老头也没能从他嘴里掏出一句话来。岗哨和司令部的值勤人员都换了班。晚上，又押进来一个人。保尔认出他是糖厂的木匠多林尼克。他长得很结实，矮墩墩的，破外套里面穿着一件退了色的黄衬衫。他用细心的目光把小仓库迅速察看了一遍。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 保尔在一九一七年二月里看见过他，那时候，这个小城也受到了革命浪潮的冲击。在许多次喧闹的示威游行中，保尔只听到过一个布尔什维克演说。这个人就是多林尼克。当时他爬上路旁的一道围墙，向士兵们演讲。记得他最后这样说：“士兵们，你们支持布尔什维克吧，他们是决不会出卖你们的！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 从那以后，保尔再没见到过他。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 新难友的到来使老头很高兴。显然，整天坐着不说一句话，他太难受了。多林尼克挨着老头坐在板床上，和他一道抽着烟，详细询问了各种情况。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 然后，他坐到保尔身边，问他：“你有什么好消息吗？你是为什么给抓来的？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 多林尼克得到的回答只是简简单单的一两个字。他感觉出这是对方对他不信任，所以才不愿意多说话。但是，当木匠了解到这个小伙子的罪名之后，就用那对机敏的眼睛惊讶地盯着他，看了好久。他又在保尔身旁坐下。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “这么说，是你把朱赫来救走了？原来是这样。我还不知道你被捕了呢。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 保尔感到很突然，急忙用胳膊支起身子。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “哪个朱赫来？我什么也不知道。什么罪名不能往我头上安哪！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 多林尼克却笑了笑，凑到他跟前。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “得了，小朋友。你别瞒我了。我知道得比你多。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 他怕老头听到，又压低了声音，说：“是我亲自把朱赫来送走的，现在他说不定已经到了地方。他把这件事的经过全都跟我讲了。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 他沉默了一会儿，似乎在考虑什么，随后又补充了一句：“你这小伙子，看来还真不错。不过，你给他们关在这儿，情况他们又都知道，这可真他妈的不妙，简直是糟糕透了。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 他脱下外套，铺在地上，背靠墙坐了下来，又卷起一支烟。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 多林尼克最后这几句话等于把一切都告诉了保尔。很显然，多林尼克是自己人。既然是他送走了朱赫来，这就是说…… \\n\\n \\n\\n 到了晚上，保尔已经知道多林尼克是因为在佩特留拉的哥萨克中间进行鼓动被捕的。他正在散发省革命委员会号召他们投诚、参加红军的传单，当场给抓住了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 多林尼克很谨慎，没有向保尔讲多少东西。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “谁知道会怎么样呢？”他心里想。“他们说不定会用通条抽他。小伙子还太嫩哪！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 夜间，躺下睡觉的时候，他用简单扼要的话表示了自己的担心：“保尔，你我眼下的处境可以说是糟糕透了。咱们等着瞧吧，不知道是个什么结局。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 第二天，仓库里又关进来一个犯人。这个人大耳朵，细脖子，是全城出名的理发师什廖马·泽利采尔。他比比划划，激动地对多林尼克说：“瞧，是这么回事，福克斯、勃卢夫斯坦、特拉赫坦贝格他们准备捧着面包和盐去欢迎他。我说，你们愿意欢迎，你们就欢迎吧，但是想叫谁跟他们一道签名，代表全体犹太居民，那可对不起，没人干。他们有他们的打算。福克斯开商店，特拉赫坦贝格有磨坊，可我有什么呢？别的穷光蛋又有什么呢？这些人什么也没有。对了，我这个人倒是有一条长舌头，爱多嘴。今天我给一个哥萨克军官刮胡子，他刚到这儿不久，我对他说：‘请问，这儿的虐犹事件，大头目佩特留拉知道不？他能接见犹太人请愿团吗？’唉，我这条长舌头啊，给我惹过多少是非！等我给他刮完胡子，扑上香粉，一切都按一流水平弄妥当之后，你猜怎么着？他站起来，不但不给钱，反而把我抓起来，说我进行煽动，反对政府。”泽利采尔用拳头捶着胸脯，继续说：“怎么是煽动？我说什么啦？我不过是随便打听一下……为这个就把我关了进来……” \\n\\n \\n\\n 泽利采尔非常激动，又是扭多林尼克的衬衣扣子，又是扯他的胳膊。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 多林尼克听他发牢骚，不由得笑了。等泽利采尔讲完，多林尼克严肃地对他说：“我说，什廖马，你是个聪明的小伙子，怎么干出这样的蠢事，偏偏在这种时候多嘴多舌。这个地方我看是来不得的！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 泽利采尔会意地看了他一眼，绝望地挥了挥手。门开了，保尔认得的那个酿私酒的老太婆又被推了进来。她恶狠狠地咒骂着那个押送她的哥萨克：“让火把你和你们司令都烧成灰！叫他喝了我的酒不得好死！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 卫兵随手把门砰的一声关上了，接着，听到了上锁的声音。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 老太婆坐到板床上，老头逗笑地欢迎她：“怎么，你又回来了，碎嘴子老太婆？贵客临门，请坐吧！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 老太婆狠狠瞪了他一眼，一把抓起小包袱，挨着多林尼克，坐在地上。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 匪徒们从她手里弄到了几瓶私酒，又把她押了回来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 突然，门外守卫室里响起了喊声和脚步声，一个人高声发着命令。仓库里所有的犯人都把头转向房门。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 广场上有座难看的破教堂，教堂顶上是个古式的钟楼，现在教堂前面正发生一桩本城少见的新奇事。谢乔夫狙击师的部队，全副武装，列成一个个四方的队形，从三面把广场围起来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 在前面，从教堂门口起，三个步兵团排成棋盘格式的队形，一直站到学校的围墙跟前。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 佩特留拉“政府”的这个精锐师团的士兵们站在那里。他们穿着肮脏的灰军服，戴着不伦不类的、半个南瓜似的俄国钢盔，步枪靠着大腿，身上缠满了子弹带。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这个师团衣着整齐，穿的都是前沙皇军队的储备品，师团的一大半人是顽固反对苏维埃的富农分子。这次他们调到这里来，为的是保卫这个具有重大战略意义的铁路枢纽站。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 铁路的闪亮的铁轨从舍佩托夫卡朝五个不同的方向伸展出去。对佩特留拉来说，失去这个据点，就等于失去一切。他那个“政府”的地盘现在只有巴掌大了，小小的温尼察居然成了首都。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 大头目佩特留拉决定亲自来这里视察部队。一切都已经准备好，就等着欢迎他了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 有一个团的新兵被安排在广场后边的角落里，那是最不显眼的地方。他们全是光着脚、穿着五颜六色衣服的年轻人。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这些农村小伙子，有的是半夜里被抓的壮丁，从炕上拖来的，有的是在大街上被抓来的。他们没有一个愿意打仗，都说：“谁也不是傻瓜。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 佩特留拉军官们最大的成绩，就是把这些人押解到城里，编成连、营，并且把武器发给了他们。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 但是，第二天，三分之一的新兵就不见了，后来，人数一天比一天减少。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 要是发给他们靴子，那简直是太愚蠢了，而且也没有那么多的靴子可发。于是下了一道命令：应征入伍者鞋袜自备。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这道命令产生了奇妙的效果。谁知道新兵们从哪里拣来这么多破烂不堪的鞋子，全是靠铁丝或者麻绳绑在脚上的。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 于是只好叫他们光着脚参加阅兵式。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 站在步兵后面的，是戈卢勃的骑兵团。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 骑兵们挡住密密麻麻的看热闹的人群。大家都想看看阅兵式。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 大头目本人要来！这可是百年不遇的大事，谁也不愿意错过这个免费参观的好机会。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 教堂的台阶上站着一群校官和尉官，神甫的两个女儿，几个乌克兰教师，一帮“自由哥萨克”和稍微有点驼背的市长——总之，是一群经过挑选的“各界人士”的代表。身穿契尔克斯长袍的步兵总监也站在这群人中间。他是阅兵式的总指挥。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 教堂里，瓦西里神甫穿起了复活节才穿的法衣。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 欢迎佩特留拉的仪式准备得十分隆重。蓝黄色的旗子也升了起来，征来的新兵要向旗子举行效忠宣誓。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 师长坐着一辆掉了漆的、像痨病鬼似的福特牌汽车，前往车站迎接佩特留拉。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 步兵总监把蓄着两撇漂亮小胡子的仪表堂堂的切尔尼亚克上校叫到跟前。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “你带人去检查一下警备司令部和后方机关，要他们各处都打扫干净，收拾整齐。如果有犯人，你就查问一下，把那些无关紧要的废物都撵走。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 切尔尼亚克把皮靴后跟一碰，敬了个礼，拉住走到跟前的一个哥萨克大尉，一道骑马走了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 步兵总监彬彬有礼地问神甫的大女儿：“宴会你们准备得怎么样了？一切都就绪了吧？” \\n\\n \\n\\n “是啊，警备司令正在张罗呢。”她一边回答，一边目不转睛地盯着漂亮的步兵总监。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 突然，人群骚动起来。一个骑兵伏在马背上，沿公路飞驰而来，只听他挥着手高叫：“来啦！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 步兵总监大声喊起了口令：“各——就——各——位！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 军官们慌忙跑到自己的队列中去。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 当福特牌汽车气喘吁吁地开到教堂门口的时候，乐队奏起了《乌克兰仍在人间》的乐曲。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 大头目佩特留拉本人，跟在师长后面，笨拙地从汽车里钻了出来。他中等身材，一颗有棱有角的脑袋结结实实地长在紫红色的脖子上，身上穿着上等蓝色近卫军呢料做的乌克兰上衣，扎着黄皮带，皮带上的麂皮枪套里插着一支小巧的勃朗宁手枪，头上戴着克伦斯基军帽，上面缀着一颗三叉戟的珐琅帽徽。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 西蒙·佩特留拉没有一点威武的气派，完全不像一个军人。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他听完了步兵总监的简短报告，似乎对什么不太满意。随后，市长向他致欢迎词。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 佩特留拉心不在焉地听着，眼睛从市长头顶上望过去，看着那些肃立的队列。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “开始检阅吧。”他向步兵总监点了点头。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 佩特留拉登上旗杆旁边一座不大的检阅台，向士兵们发表了十分钟的演说。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他讲得空泛无力，一直提不起精神来，大概是路上太累了。演说结束的时候，士兵们刻板地喊了一阵：“万岁！万岁！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 他走下检阅台，用手帕擦了擦脑门上的汗。随后，就在步兵总监和师长的陪同下，检阅各个部队。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 走过新兵队列的时候，他轻蔑地眯起了眼睛，生气地咬着嘴唇。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 检阅快结束了，新兵开始宣誓。他们参差不齐地列队走到旗子跟前，先吻一下瓦西里神甫手里捧着的圣经，再吻一下旗子的一角。就在这个时候，发生了一件意外的事情。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 谁也不知道怎么会有一个请愿团挤进了广场，走到佩特留拉跟前。走在前面的是经营木材的富商勃卢夫斯坦，他双手捧着面包和盐，他后面是百货店老板福克斯和另外三个大商人。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 勃卢夫斯坦像奴才一样弯着腰，把面包和盐捧到佩特留拉面前，站在一旁的军官接了过去。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “犹太居民向您，国家元首阁下，表示衷心的感激和敬意。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 恭请阁下收下犹太人的颂词。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “好的。”佩特留拉哼了一句，草草地看了看颂词。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 这时候福克斯说话了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “小民等斗胆恭请阁下开恩，准许犹太人开张营业，并保护犹太人免遭蹂躏。”福克斯费了很大劲才把“蹂躏”这两个字从嘴里挤出来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 佩特留拉恼怒地皱紧了眉头。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “我的军队从来不会蹂躏犹太人，这一点你们应当记住。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 福克斯无可奈何地把两手一摊。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 佩特留拉烦躁地耸了耸肩膀，他对不识时务的请愿团恰好在这个时刻出场大为恼火。他转过身来，对站在身后气得直咬黑胡子的戈卢勃说：“上校先生，他们控告您的哥萨克，请您调查一下，做出处置。”说完，又转身命令步兵总监：“阅兵式开始！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 倒霉的请愿团万万没有想到会碰上戈卢勃，所以，急忙要溜走。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 观众的注意力，全都被分列式的准备工作吸引住了。响起了刺耳的口号声。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 戈卢勃逼近勃卢夫斯坦，一字一句地小声说：“你们这帮异教徒，赶快给我滚蛋，不然我就把你们剁成肉酱。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 军乐响起来了。第一批部队开始通过广场。士兵们经过佩特留拉检阅台的时候，机械地朝他喊着“万岁！”然后从公路转到旁边的街道上去。军官们穿着崭新的草绿色军装，像散步一样，甩着手杖，潇洒地走在连队前头。这种军官甩手杖、士兵持通条的分列式，是谢乔夫师的创举。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 新兵走在最后面，他们步伐混乱，磕磕撞撞，乱七八糟地挤作一团。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 一双双赤脚踏在路上，发出柔软的沙沙声。军官们竭力想维持好秩序，但是做不到。第二连走到检阅台前的时候，右翼排头的一个穿麻布衬衫的小伙子，只顾惊奇地张着嘴巴看大头目，一不小心，踩在坑里，扑通一声栽倒在地上。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他的步枪摔在石路上，哗啦啦地滑出好远。小伙子拼命想爬起来，可是后面的人立刻又把他撞倒了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 观众哈哈大笑起来。队伍更加混乱了，乱糟糟地通过了广场。那个小伙子慌忙捡起步枪，去追赶队伍。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 佩特留拉把脸扭向一旁，不愿再看这个大煞风景的场面。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他不等队伍过完，就向轿车走去。步兵总监跟在他身后，小心翼翼地问：“将军阁下，不留下用膳吗？” \\n\\n \\n\\n “不了！”佩特留拉气冲冲地说。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 谢廖沙、瓦莉亚、克利姆卡也杂在教堂高大围墙后面的人群里看热闹。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 谢廖沙两手紧紧抓住栏杆，眼睛里充满了仇恨，盯着下面的队伍。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “咱们走吧，瓦莉亚，人家散场收摊了。”他用挑衅的语气提高了嗓门喊，故意让所有的人都听到。说完，就跳下了栏杆，人们吃惊地转过脸来望着他。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 但是，他谁也不理睬，径直向围墙门口走去。姐姐瓦莉亚和克利姆卡跟在他的后边。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 切尔尼亚克上校和哥萨克大尉在警备司令部门前跳下马，把马交给勤务兵，急忙走进了警卫室。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 切尔尼亚克厉声问一个勤务兵：“司令在哪儿？” \\n\\n \\n\\n “不知道。”那个小兵慢条斯理地回答。“他出去了。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 切尔尼亚克看了看这间又脏又乱的警卫室。所有的床铺都是乱糟糟的，司令部的几个哥萨克横躺竖卧，满不在乎地倒在床铺上，就连长官进来了也没有想到要站起来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “怎么搞的，简直是个猪圈！”切尔尼亚克吼叫起来。“你们怎么像一群猪崽子一样躺在这儿？”他朝那些仍然躺着不动的人咆哮。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 有个哥萨克坐了起来，打了一个饱嗝，对他毫不客气地喊道：“你嚷嚷什么？我们有我们的长官，用不着你来大喊大叫！” \\n\\n \\n\\n “你说什么？”切尔尼亚克一下子跳到他跟前。“畜生，你这是跟谁讲话？我是切尔尼亚克上校！狗娘养的，你没听说过？马上都给我爬起来！不然，我就用通条挨个抽你们！”怒气冲冲的上校在屋子里跑来跑去。“马上把脏东西打扫干净！ \\n\\n \\n\\n 把床铺整理好！把你们的狗脸也收拾出个人样来！看看你们像什么东西！不是哥萨克，简直是一帮土匪！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 上校发起脾气来就不得了。他发疯似的一脚踢翻了路中间的脏水桶。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 哥萨克大尉也不甘落后。他不住嘴地臭骂卫兵，挥舞着马鞭子，把那些懒鬼赶下了床。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “大头目正在检阅，说不定到这儿来。你们动作快点！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 那些哥萨克一见事态严重，弄不好真会挨一顿抽，而且他们全都知道切尔尼亚克的厉害。于是就都像火烧屁股似的忙碌起来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他们干得很卖劲。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “还得去看看犯人。”大尉提议说。“谁知道他们都关了些什么人？要是大头目到这儿来，就糟糕了。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 切尔尼亚克问卫兵：“钥匙在哪儿？马上把门打开！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 警卫队长慌忙跑过来，开了锁。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “你们司令到底上哪儿去了？谁有那么多工夫等他！马上把他找来！”切尔尼亚克发着命令。“警卫队全体到院子里集合，整好队！……为什么步枪不上刺刀？” \\n\\n \\n\\n “我们是昨天才换班的。”警卫队长解释说。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 然后，他就跑出去找警备司令。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 大尉一脚踢开了小仓库的门。有几个人从地上坐了起来，其余的人仍旧躺着不动。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “把门全敞开！”切尔尼亚克命令说。“屋子里太暗了。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 他仔细端详着每个犯人的脸。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “你是为什么坐牢的？”他厉声问坐在板床上的老头。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 老头欠起身子，提了提裤子。他被这厉声的喊叫吓得有点结巴，含糊不清地回答说：“我自己也不知道。把我抓进来，我就坐了牢。我家院子里一匹马丢了，可那能怪我吗？” \\n\\n \\n\\n “什么人的马？”哥萨克大尉打断他，问。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “官家的呗！住在我家的老总把马换酒喝了，反过来赖到我头上。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 切尔尼亚克把老头从头到脚迅速打量了一下，不耐烦地耸了耸肩膀。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “收拾起你的破烂，赶快给我滚蛋！”他喊完之后，转身去问那个酿私酒的老太婆。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 老头一下子还不敢相信会把他放了，他眨着那双半瞎的眼睛问大尉：“那么，许可我走啦？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 大尉点了点头，意思是说：赶快滚蛋，越快越好。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 老头慌忙从床上解下口袋，侧着身子跑出门去。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “你是为什么坐牢的？”切尔尼亚克已经在盘问老太婆了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 老太婆赶紧吞下嘴里的肉包子，忙不迭地说：“长官大人，我给关起来可实在是冤枉！我是个寡妇，他们喝了我造的酒，随后就把我关了起来。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “这么说，你是做私酒买卖的？”切尔尼亚克问。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “这叫什么买卖呀？”她委屈地说。“司令他拿了我四瓶酒，一个钱也不给。他们全是这样：喝了我的酒，不给钱。这叫什么买卖呀！” \\n\\n \\n\\n “得了，赶快见鬼去吧！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 老太婆连问都不再问一声，抓起小筐，一面鞠躬表示感激，一面退向门口，嘴里说：“长官大人，愿上帝保佑您长生不老！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 多林尼克看着这出滑稽戏，惊讶地睁大了眼睛。被关押的人谁也不明白这是怎么回事。只有一点是清楚的：来的这两个人是大官，有权处置犯人。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “你是怎么回事？”切尔尼亚克问多林尼克。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “站起来回上校大人的话！”哥萨克大尉吆喝着。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 多林尼克慢腾腾地、艰难地从地上站了起来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “我问你，你是为什么坐牢的？”切尔尼亚克又问了一遍。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 多林尼克看了上校几秒钟，看着他那翘起来的胡子和刮得光溜溜的脸，看着他那缀着珐琅帽徽的新克伦斯基帽的帽檐。突然，闪出一个使人兴奋的念头：“说不定能混出去呢？” \\n\\n \\n\\n “我是因为晚上八点钟以后在大街上走给抓来的。”他顺口编了一个理由。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 说完，他全身都紧张起来，焦急地等待着反应。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “你深更半夜逛什么大街？” \\n\\n \\n\\n “不到半夜，也就十一点钟。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 他说这话的时候，已经不相信自己也能交好运了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “走吧！”他突然听到了这简短的命令，两条腿的膝盖不由得哆嗦了一下。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 多林尼克连外套都忘了拿，一步就跨到门口，这时哥萨克大尉已经在问下一个人了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 保尔是最后一个。他坐在地上，眼前的一切，把他完全弄糊涂了。连多林尼克都放走了，他一下子竟弄不明白。简直不懂发生了什么事情。这些人都放走了。但是，多林尼克，多林尼克……他说是夜里上街被捕的……保尔终于懂了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 上校已经在审问瘦骨嶙峋的泽利采尔，还是那句话：“你是为什么坐牢的？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 面色苍白、心情激动的理发师急促地回答说：“他们说我进行煽动，可我不明白，我怎么煽动了。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 切尔尼亚克立刻警觉起来：“什么？煽动？你煽动什么了？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 泽利采尔困惑地摊开两只手，说：“我也不知道。我只不过是说，有人正在征集签名，要以犹太居民的名义向大头目上请愿书。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “什么请愿书？”哥萨克大尉和切尔尼亚克都向他逼近了一步。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “请求禁止虐犹。你们知道，这儿就发生过一次可怕的虐犹事件。犹太人都很害怕。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “明白了。”切尔尼亚克打断了他的话。“犹太佬，我们会给你写请愿书的！”他转身对大尉说：“这个家伙得弄个牢靠点的地方关起来！把他押到指挥部去！我要亲自审问他，到底是谁要请愿。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 泽利采尔还想分辩，但是大尉把手一扬，在他背上狠狠地抽了一马鞭。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “住口，你这畜生！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 泽利采尔疼得脸都变了形，躲到墙角去了。他嘴唇抖动着，差点失声痛哭起来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 就在这时候，保尔站了起来。仓库里的犯人只剩下他和泽利采尔两个了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 切尔尼亚克站在这个小伙子面前，用那双黑眼睛上下打量着他。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “喂，你是怎么到这儿来的？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 上校马上就听到了回答：“我从马鞍子上割了一块皮子做鞋掌。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “什么马鞍子？”上校没有听明白。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “我家住了两个哥萨克，我从一个旧马鞍子上割了一块皮子钉鞋掌，就因为这个，他们把我送到这儿来了。”保尔怀着获得自由的强烈愿望，又补充了一句：“我要是知道他们不让……” \\n\\n \\n\\n 上校轻蔑地看着他。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “这个警备司令尽搞些什么名堂，真是活见鬼，抓来这么一帮犯人！”他转身对着门口，喊道：“你可以回家了。告诉你爸爸，叫他好好收拾你一顿。行了，快走你的吧！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 保尔简直不敢相信自己的耳朵，心都要从胸膛里跳出来了。他从地上抓起多林尼克的外套，朝门口冲去。他穿过警卫室，从刚刚走出来的切尔尼亚克身后悄悄溜到院子里，然后从栅栏门出去，跑到大街上。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 仓库里只剩下倒霉的泽利采尔一个人了。他又痛苦又悲伤，回头看了一眼，下意识地向门口迈了几步。这时候，一个卫兵走进外屋，关上仓库的门，加上锁，在门外的板凳上坐了下来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 在台阶上，切尔尼亚克对哥萨克大尉得意地说：“幸亏咱们来看了看。你瞧，这儿关了这么多废物。我看得把警备司令关两个礼拜禁闭。怎么样，咱们走吧？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 警卫队长在院子里集合好了队伍。一见上校走出来，马上跑过来报告：“上校大人，一切照你的吩咐准备完毕。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 切尔尼亚克把一只脚伸进马镫，轻轻一蹿，上了马。大尉费了很大劲才跨上那匹调皮的马。切尔尼亚克勒住缰绳，对警卫队长说：“告诉你们司令，我已经把他塞在这儿的一群废物都放走了。再转告他，他在这儿搞得乌七八糟，我要关他两个礼拜禁闭。牢里关着的那个家伙，马上给我押到指挥部来。注意警卫。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “是，上校大人。”警卫队长敬了个礼。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 上校和哥萨克大尉用马刺刺着马，向广场飞驰而去。那里的阅兵式已经快要结束了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 保尔翻过第七道栅栏，停了下来。他已经没有力气再往前跑了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 在闷死人的仓库里饿了这么多天，他一点劲也没有了。回家去不行，到谢廖沙家去也不行——要是被人发现了，他们全家都得遭殃。上哪儿去呢？ \\n\\n \\n\\n 他不知道怎么办才好，只得继续往前跑，越过一个又一个菜园子和庄园后院。直到撞在一道栅栏上，他才冷静下来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 看了一眼，他愣住了：高高的木栅栏里面是林务官家的花园。两条疲乏无力的腿竟把他带到这里来了！难道是他自己想跑到这里来的吗？不是。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 那么，为什么他偏偏跑到这里来了呢？ \\n\\n \\n\\n 这个问题他回答不出来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 应当找个地方休息一下，然后再考虑下一步怎么办；他知道花园里有个木头凉亭，那里谁也发现不了他。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 保尔纵身一跳，一只手攀住栅栏，爬上去，翻身进了花园。他看了看那座隐现在一片树木后面的房子，便向凉亭走去。凉亭四面光秃秃的，夏天爬满凉亭的山葡萄不见了，现在一点遮挡都没有。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他正要转身回到栅栏那里去，但是已经晚了：他听到背后有狗在狂叫。从房子那边，有一条大狗顺着落满枯叶的小道，向他猛扑过来，可怕的汪汪声震荡着整个花园。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 保尔做好了自卫的准备。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 大狗第一次扑上来，被保尔一脚踢开了。狗又要往他身上扑。要不是传来了一个清脆的喊声，真不知道这场搏斗会怎样结束。保尔听到一个熟悉的声音在喊：“特列佐尔，回来！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 冬妮亚沿着小路跑来了。她抓住大狗脖子上的皮圈，对站在栅栏旁边的保尔说：“您怎么跑到这儿来了呢？狗会把您咬伤的。幸亏我……” \\n\\n \\n\\n 她突然愣住了，眼睛睁得大大的。这个闯进花园的少年多么像保尔啊！ \\n\\n \\n\\n 站在栅栏旁边的少年动了一下，轻声说：“你……您还认得我吗？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 冬妮亚惊叫了一声，急速向保尔跟前迈了一步。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “保夫鲁沙，是你呀！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 特列佐尔把她的叫声当成了进攻的信号，猛地一跃，扑了过去。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “走开！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 特列佐尔被冬妮亚踢了几脚，委屈地夹起尾巴，向房子那边慢慢走去。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 冬妮亚紧紧握住保尔的双手，问他：“你给放出来了？” \\n\\n \\n\\n “难道你已经知道了？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 冬妮亚抑制不住内心的激动，急促地回答说：“我全都知道。莉莎对我说了。可你怎么会到这儿来的呢？ \\n\\n \\n\\n 是他们把你放出来的吗？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 保尔有气无力地回答说：“他们错放了我，我才跑了出来。他们现在大概又在搜我了。我是无意中跑到这儿来的，想到亭子里歇一会儿。”他抱歉似的补充了一句：“我太累了。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 冬妮亚注视了他一会儿。她又惊又喜，内心交织着无限的怜悯和温暖的柔情。她用力握着保尔的双手，说：“保夫鲁沙，亲爱的，亲爱的保尔，我的亲人，好人……我爱你……你听见了吗？……你这孩子，我的倔强的小东西，你那天为什么走了？现在，你到我们家，到我这儿来吧。我说什么也不放你走了。我们家很清静，你愿意住多久就住多久。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 但是保尔摇了摇头。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “要是他们把我从你们家里搜出来，那可怎么办？我不能到你们家去。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 她把保尔的手握得更紧了，她的睫毛在颤动，眼睛里闪着泪花。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “你要是不留下，就永远别再见我。现在，阿尔焦姆也不在家，他给抓去开火车了。所有的铁路员工都被征调走了。你说你能到哪儿去呢？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 保尔理解她的心情，知道她很担心，只是他怕连累心爱的姑娘，才拿不定主意。但是，这些天的折磨已经使他难以支持，他很想休息一下，而且又饿得难受。他终于让步了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他坐在冬妮亚房间里的沙发上，厨房里母女俩正在谈话：“妈妈，你听我说，现在保尔正坐在我的房间里，你还记得他吗？他是我的学生。我一点也不想瞒你。他是因为搭救了一个布尔什维克水兵给抓起来的。现在他逃出来了，可是没有藏身的地方。”她的声音颤抖了。“妈妈，我求你让他暂时住在咱们家里。也许只要住几天。他又饿又累。好妈妈，如果你爱我，你就不要反对。我求求你啦。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 女儿的眼睛恳求地望着母亲。母亲也试探地注视着女儿。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “好吧，我不反对。可是你把他安排在什么地方住呢？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 冬妮亚涨红了脸，非常难为情而又激动地说：“我把他安顿在我屋里的长沙发上。这事可以暂时不告诉爸爸。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 母亲直视着冬妮亚的眼睛，问她：“这就是你掉眼泪的原因吗？” \\n\\n \\n\\n “嗯。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “可他还完全是个孩子啊！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 冬妮亚激动地扯着衣袖，说：“是啊，可是如果他不逃出来，他们照样会把他当作成年人枪毙的。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 她们彼此没有再多说什么。叶卡捷林娜·米哈伊洛夫娜这一生吃足了苦头。她母亲是个刻板守旧的妇人，成天讲的是那些虚伪的“礼仪”、“修养”，并对她严加管教。叶卡捷林娜·米哈伊洛夫娜至今记得，那些旧礼教如何毒害了她的青春年华，所以在女儿的教育问题上，她摒弃了市侩阶层的许多偏见和陋习，而采取一种开明的态度。尽管如此，她仍然密切关注着女儿的成长，有时还为她忧心忡忡，并不动声色地帮助她摆脱各种困境。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 现在，保尔要住到她们家来，她也为此而不安。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 可冬妮亚却热心地张罗起来了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “妈妈，他得洗个澡。我马上就准备好。他实在脏得像个真正的火夫，已经好多天连脸都没洗了……” \\n\\n \\n\\n 她跑来跑去，忙碌着，又是烧洗澡水，又是找衣服。接着，她跑进屋，一句话也不说，抓起保尔的手，把他拉进了洗澡间。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “你把衣服全脱下来。要换的衣服在这儿。你的衣服都得洗。你就穿这一套吧！”她指了指椅子上叠得整整齐齐的领子带白条的蓝色水兵服和肥腿裤子。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 保尔惊奇地向四面望着，冬妮亚笑了：“这衣服是我的，跳舞会上女扮男装用的。你穿上一定很合适。好，你就洗吧，我走啦。趁你洗澡，我去做饭。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 她随手关上了门。保尔只好迅速地脱掉衣服，跳进澡盆。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 一个小时后，母亲、女儿和保尔三个人一同在厨房里吃午饭了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 保尔饿极了，不知不觉地一连吃了三盘。开头他在叶卡捷林娜·米哈伊洛夫娜面前很不自然，后来看到她很热情，也就不再拘束了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 午饭后，三个人坐在冬妮亚房间里，叶卡捷林娜·米哈伊洛夫娜请保尔讲一讲他的遭遇，保尔把他遭受的苦难讲了一遍。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “您以后打算怎么办呢？”叶卡捷林娜·米哈伊洛夫娜问。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 保尔沉思了一会儿，说：“我想见见我哥哥阿尔焦姆，然后就离开这儿。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “到哪儿去呢？” \\n\\n \\n\\n “我想到乌曼或者基辅去。我自己还说不准，不过我一定要离开这儿。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 保尔简直不敢相信，这一切会变化得这样快。早晨他还在坐牢，现在却坐到了冬妮亚身边，穿上了干干净净的衣服，而最主要的则是已经获得了自由。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 生活，有时候就是这样变幻莫测：一会儿乌云满天，一会儿太阳露出笑脸。要是没有再度被捕的危险，他现在可真算得是一个幸福的小伙子了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 然而，正是现在，在这宽大而安静的房子里，他随时都可能被抓走。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 应当到别处去，随便到哪里，反正不能留在这里。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 但是，心里实在舍不得离开这个地方，真见鬼！以前读英雄加里波第的传记，多带劲！他是那样羡慕加里波第，看，他的一生过得多艰难！在世界各地都受迫害！而他，保尔，一共才受了七天痛苦的磨难，就好像过了整整一年似的。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 看来，他保尔并不是什么了不起的英雄。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “你在想什么呢？”冬妮亚俯下身子问他。保尔觉得她那碧蓝的眼睛好像深不见底。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “冬妮亚，我给你讲讲赫里斯季娜的事，你想听吗？” \\n\\n \\n\\n “你快讲吧！”她高兴地说。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “……打那以后，她就再也没有回来。”他吃力地讲出最后这句话。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 房间里，时钟滴答滴答有节奏地响着，冬妮亚低下头，使劲咬着嘴唇，差点没哭出声来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 保尔看了她一眼。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “我今天就得离开这儿。”他坚决地说。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “不，不行，你今天哪儿也不能去！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 她把纤细温暖的手指轻轻伸到他那不驯顺的头发里，温情地抚摸着。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “冬妮亚，你该帮助我。你到机车库去找一找阿尔焦姆，再捎个纸条给谢廖沙。我的手枪藏在老鸹窝里，我自己不能去拿，让谢廖沙给拿下来。这些你能替我办到吗？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 冬妮亚站起身来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “我现在就去找莉莎。我们俩一起到机车库去。你写条子吧，我给谢廖沙送去。他住在什么地方？要是他想见你，告诉他你在这儿吗？” \\n\\n \\n\\n 保尔想了想，说：“让他今天晚上亲自把手枪送到花园里来吧。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 冬妮亚很晚才回来。保尔睡得正香。她的手一碰到他，他就惊醒了。冬妮亚高兴地笑着说：“阿尔焦姆马上就来。他刚刚出车回来。亏得莉莎的父亲担保，才准他出来一个钟头。火车头停在机车库里。我不能告诉他你在这儿。我只说，有非常重要的事情要转告他。你瞧，他来了。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 冬妮亚跑去开门。阿尔焦姆站在门口，惊呆了，他简直不敢相信自己的眼睛。冬妮亚等他进来后，关上了门，免得患伤寒病的父亲在书房里听到。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 阿尔焦姆两只手臂紧紧抱住保尔，弄得他的骨节都格格地响起来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “好弟弟！保尔！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 大家商量定了：保尔明天走。阿尔焦姆把他安顿在勃鲁扎克的机车上，带到卡扎京去。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 平素很刚强的阿尔焦姆，这些天来，一直不知道弟弟的命运怎样，心烦意乱，已经沉不住气了。现在，他说不出有多高兴。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “就这么办，明天早晨五点钟你到材料库去。火车头在那儿上完木柴，你就坐上去。我本来想跟你多谈一会儿，可是来不及了，我得马上回去。明天我去送你。我们铁路工人也给编成了一个营，就像德国人在这儿的时候一样，有卫兵看着我们干活。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 阿尔焦姆告别以后，走了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 天很快黑下来。谢廖沙该到花园里来了。保尔在黑暗的房间里踱来踱去，等着他。冬妮亚和母亲一块陪着她父亲。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 保尔和谢廖沙在黑暗中见了面。他们互相紧紧地握着手。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 瓦莉亚也跟来了。他们低声地交谈着。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “手枪我没拿来。你们家院子里尽是佩特留拉匪兵，停着大车，还生起了火。上树根本不行。太不凑巧了。”谢廖沙这样解释着。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “去他的吧！”保尔安慰他说。“这样说不定更好。路上查出来，脑袋就保不住了。不过，你以后一定要把枪拿走。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 瓦莉亚凑到保尔跟前，问：“你什么时候走？” \\n\\n \\n\\n “明天，瓦莉亚，天一亮就起身。” \\n\\n \\n\\n “你是怎么逃出来的？讲一讲吧！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 保尔低声把自己的遭遇很快讲了一遍。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他们亲切地告了别。谢廖沙没有心思开玩笑了，他心情非常激动。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “保尔，祝你一路平安！可别忘了我们！”瓦莉亚勉强讲出了这句话。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他们走了，立刻消失在黑暗里。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 房间里静悄悄的。只有时钟不知疲倦地走着，发出清晰的滴答声。两个人谁也没有睡意，再过六个小时就要分别，也许从今以后永远不能再见面了。两个人思潮起伏，都有千言万语涌上心头，但是，在这短短的几小时里，难道能够说得完吗？ \\n\\n \\n\\n 青春啊，无限美好的青春！这时，情欲还没有萌动，只有急促的心跳隐约显示它的存在；这时，手无意中触到女友的胸脯，便惊慌地颤抖着，急速移开；这时，青春的友谊约束着最后一步的行动。在这样的时刻，还有什么比心爱姑娘的手更可亲的呢？这双手紧紧地搂住你的脖子，接着就是电击一般炽热的吻。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 从他们建立感情以来，这是第二次接吻。除了母亲以外，谁也没有抚爱过保尔，相反，他倒是经常挨打。正因为这样，冬妮亚的爱抚使他分外激动。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他在屈辱和残酷的生活中长大，不知道还会有这样的欢乐。在人生道路上结识这位姑娘，真是极大的幸福。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 最后的几个小时他们是紧挨在一起度过的。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “你还记得跳崖之前我向你许的愿吗？”她的声音轻得几乎听不到。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他闻到了她的发香，似乎也看见了她的眼神。当然，她的许诺他是记得的。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “难道我能够允许自己让你还愿吗？我是多么尊重你，冬妮亚。我不知道怎么跟你说才好，说不上来。我明白，你是不经意才说了那句话的。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 他无法再说下去了。是的。熟悉的、火一般的热吻封住了他的嘴。她那柔软的身体如同弹簧，又是何等顺从……但是，青春的友谊高于一切，比火更炽烈更明亮。要抵挡住诱惑真难哪，比登天还难，可只要性格是坚强的，友谊是真诚的，那就可以做到。 \\n\\n \\n\\n “冬妮亚，等时局平定以后，我一定能当上电工，要是你不嫌弃我，要是你真心爱我，不是闹着玩，我一定做你的好丈夫。我永远也不会打你，要是我欺侮你，就叫我不得好死。” \\n\\n \\n\\n 他们不敢拥抱着睡觉，怕这样睡着了，让母亲看见引起猜疑，就分开了。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 天已经渐渐透亮，他们才入睡。临睡前他们再三约定，谁也不忘记谁。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 清早，叶卡捷林娜·米哈伊洛夫娜叫醒了保尔。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他急忙起来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他在洗澡间里换上自己的衣服、靴子，穿上多林尼克的外套。这时候，母亲已经叫醒了冬妮亚。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他们穿过潮湿的晨雾，急忙向车站走去，绕道来到堆放木柴的地方。阿尔焦姆在上好木柴的火车头旁边，焦急地等待着他们。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 那辆叫做“狗鱼”的大功率机车扑哧扑哧地喷着蒸汽，慢腾腾地开了过来。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 勃鲁扎克正从驾驶室里朝窗外张望。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 他们相互匆匆告别。保尔紧紧抓住机车扶梯的把手，爬了上去。他回过身来。岔道口上并排站着两个亲切熟悉的身影：高大的阿尔焦姆和苗条娇小的冬妮亚。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 风猛烈地吹动着冬妮亚的衣领和栗色的鬈发。她挥动着手。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 阿尔焦姆斜眼看了一下勉强抑制住哭泣的冬妮亚，叹了一口气，心里想：“要么我是个大傻瓜，要么这两个年轻人有点反常。保尔啊，保尔，你这个毛孩子！” \\n\\n \\n\\n 列车转弯不见了，阿尔焦姆转过身来，对冬妮亚说：“好吧，咱们俩算是朋友了吧？”于是，冬妮亚的小手就躲进了他那大手掌里。 \\n\\n \\n\\n 远处传来了火车加速的轰鸣声。 \\n\\n \\n\\n
