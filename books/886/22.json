{"id":14849,"no":22,"title":"CHAPTER XXI ECONOMY IN THE PURCHASE OF SHRUBBERY","content":"May often be achieved by a wise selection of varieties. Any extensive planting runs up into dollars fast, especially if the larger sized shrubs are selected. Fortunately successful planting depends as much upon a number of plants of one variety as upon the size and distinction of the sorts. A dozen plants of one variety of spir?a, for instance, is far more effective than one plant each of twelve varieties—try it and see if I am not right. \n \n If, therefore, one has several strips of lawn to embellish with shrubbery and wishes to economize the expenditure as far as possible it will be found a most excellent plan to make a mixed planting on the most urgent section, selecting those shrubs which by their manner of root formation offer possibilities of rapid increase and use the product for subsequent planting; taking all290 of the sort of plant so as to leave as few varieties in the old bed as possible and in this way simplifying the ultimate planting of the entire grounds. \n \n When these new offspring have reached a presentable size they may be retained and the other sorts which can now be spared may be removed to a new location, planting out the youngsters in their vacated positions. \n \n There are three classes of plants which lend themselves very readily to propagation through root division, layering and root offshoots. The first is found in those plants which make an exuberant root system of many fine feeding roots and many stems. A good example of this class is found in the Hydrangea arborescens which may be lifted, pulled apart and the several plants reset without in any way disturbing its growth intention. In this respect it differs materially from H. paniculata which, while making a generous root system, has but the one main stem and so is incapable of division but is easily propagated by cuttings thrust into the ground in the shade of the plant early in June. H. arborescens is291 similar in habit to many perennials which are increased by root division, as for instance the Shasta daisy, English daisy, English violets, polyanthus and others. \n \n Often a plant of H. arborescens purchased from the florist will admit of the removal of two or three smaller parts without seriously injuring the appearance of the original plant and if these are set out and well cared for they will quickly develop into blossoming plants for this form is an early and reliable bloomer. \n \n Spir?a Anthony Waterer is another shrub which may be increased by pulling apart the roots; indeed this plant is benefited by occasional treatment of this sort, doing much better and flowering more freely. Planted in front of taller shrubs it is a very desirable and reliable plant and if the faded flowers are removed after the spring florescence it will continue to produce flowers throughout the summer. \n \n One of the most easily propagated shrubs is found in the symphoricarpus or snow-berry; indeed, in the case of this pretty shrub the difficulty292 is not to increase one\u0027s stock as the new growth is usually prostrate the first year, lying supinely on the ground and if left undisturbed will throw out roots at the joints and rapidly produce attractive little plants as robust as the parent stock. Lifting the branches occasionally will prevent rooting but usually one likes to have the new plants form. I do. After becoming well rooted the branch should be severed between the plant and the parent. As the root growth is dense, consisting of a mass of fibrous roots, the young plants can be lifted at almost any time and reset without much check to growth. The pale, pinky-white flowers come in mid-summer, followed by the white berries which remain on the bushes well into the winter and are very attractive. \n \n Somewhat similar in its way of increase is the Deutzia-Pride of Rochester. That magnificent shrub which challenges our admiration when covered with its drooping, bell-shaped white flowers late in June and which, under favorable conditions, assumes the proportions of a small tree. Like the symphoricarpus the lateral branches are293 more or less inclined to a recumbent or prostrate habit or because of their flexibility are easily pegged down and root easily at the joint but do not make as vigorous root growth and the joint should have a little earth drawn over it and be kept moist by placing a stone on top. This shrub is so altogether desirable that several branches may well be devoted to the increase of stock, one or more plants being produced from each branch. \n \n Of those shrubs which throw up suckers from the roots the lilac will occur to most people as a well-known example, so if in buying the newer, double-flowered sorts one will insist on purchasing plants upon their own roots and not be satisfied with grafted plants one will soon become possessed of a quite respectable planting of lilacs of notable size and color of bloom. The suckers should be removed as soon as they have had one season of growth for the protection of the parent plant which will be much depleted in bloom by their permanent presence. \n \n One of the most beautiful foliage shrubs, the fern-leaved sumac—Rhus typhina laciniata—forms294 root rhizomes which send up volunteer plants at each joint. These should be removed and replanted. This is one of the most beautiful ornamentals with which I am acquainted, quite rivalling the Japanese maples. The leaves are compound or pinnate, fifteen to eighteen inches long and of a dark, rich green on the upper side, glaucous beneath and with a rich red midrib—an elegant fern-like spray which is very useful in cut flower work and in autumn turns to the most vivid crimson imaginable. It does best when protected from severe wind, from which it seems to shrink, distorting its symmetrical growth. In good rich soil a half dozen offshoots may appear the second year after planting and after one has once become familiar with its beauty all will be welcome. \n \n Another small tree or shrub with similar characteristics is the Aralia spinosa or Hercules\u0027 club as it is commonly called. This also has the compound leaves somewhat resembling the black walnut but of gigantic proportions, two to three feet in length and of equal breadth, giving295 the tree a most tropical effect. It is very easily transplanted and a few trees in a clump are very effective or it is fine as a specimen tree and owing to its abundance of spines can be utilized effectively as a hedge. Where only a single tree is wanted it is easily kept in check by cutting out the rhizomes with a spade close to the parent plant. \n \n The euonymus, or burning bush as the Indians always called it, propagates itself by means of its coral berries which appear in quantities in late summer or early fall. One finds the volunteer plants appearing every spring in places where one least expects them and one can lift and transplant them wherever desired. \n \n Another most attractive shrub which may be easily raised from seed sown in spring is the Buddleya—a plant with long racemes—in the newer form of B. veitchiaa, over twenty inches long, of violet mauve flowers of a delightful violet fragrance. Spring-sown seed will often produce blossoming plants the first season which in the second will attain a height of from three to five296 feet and be a perfect bouquet of bloom throughout the summer. The branches are somewhat pendulous and in the young state are better for a little support. They afford delightful material for cut-flower work and the odor has that fugitive elusive quality of the violet, seeming to come from different directions and to elude one\u0027s search. \n \n It will be found an excellent plant to combine with Spir?a Van Hutti as it comes into bloom after that splendid plant has rested on its laurels for the summer and keeps the hedgerow alive with bloom and fragrance. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1921/55237.html","bookId":886,"book":{"id":886,"title":"The Busy Woman\u0027s Garden Book","description":"简介： This little book has a very definite aima big aim too, though two little words or even one will serve to define itTo help, or better still, perhapshelpfulness.
