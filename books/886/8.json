{"id":14835,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VII ASPARAGUS","content":"Is one of the garden assets. Once established an asparagus bed is good for a lifetime, almost; certainly it is a permanent feature of the garden, showing little if any deterioration if well cared for and kept free from weeds. The starting of an asparagus bed is not the serious undertaking it was a few years ago, as the deep planting then thought so necessary is seldom practised now; instead it is thought sufficient to open a furrow—with the plough, if the planting is large, with the spade, if small—set the plants and fill enough earth to cover the crown of the plant, and, as growth starts, to gradually fill up the furrow until the ground is level. The ground should be of the best and heavily fertilised before planting, for asparagus is a gross81 feeder and an additional application of coarse ground bone in each hill is well worth while as it furnishes food for two or three years independently of such annual dressing as the bed may receive. For garden culture where hand cultivation is to be practised, the plants may be set in hills two or three feet apart each way, leaving room to cultivate between each way for the first few years. Two year old roots are the best to use and in planting a little mound of earth should be made in each hill, the roots of the plant spread out around this so that the earth will fit in beneath, close to the under side of the crown, then the earth should be firmed about the roots, a handful of bone meal sprinkled over the soil and the remainder of the soil filled in. Asparagus beds may be set in spring or fall; good results follow either setting. The asparagus bed must be kept free of weeds and grass from the start as once allowed to become infested with foul seed and grass it is a very discouraging proposition. One of the worst weeds to combat is the young82 asparagus plants which come up every year from self-sown seed; to avoid this the tops should be cut, as soon as the berries are red, and burned. If the tops are burned on the bed the resulting ashes will be of benefit. It has been my observation for many years that the spots where the tops were burned always gave finer stalks than the rest of the bed; this suggests the application of wood ashes as a top dressing after the dressing of manure, which should be applied every spring, has been worked into the soil. A heavy covering of barnyard manure may be applied in the fall and spaded under in the spring, or it may be applied in February; if this is not feasible it is an excellent plan to spade into the space between the hills any available manure—poultry, rabbit or sheep or stable manure that is well rotted. The space between the rows, or paths, should not be broken up when this is done as, if unbroken and hard, it is easier to keep the beds clean and an application of some good herbicide may even be used to keep down weeds here. When the bed has been thoroughly spaded and83 enriched in this way in the early part of the season I have found the after care of the bed very much more successful than when all over culture was attempted. The variety to plant is largely a matter of taste—some prefer the green, some the white grasses. Lately a preference is being shown for the green. These will always be preferred by those who like a tender asparagus. The white sorts—Bonvilete and Argenteuile—are unbelievably tough as they appear in the market though beautifully white and of mammoth proportions that make them very attractive; possibly if cut, as the green grasses are, just below the level of the ground they would prove more edible. All asparagus is tough below the ground, green as well as white, and, for this reason, should not be cut much lower than the surface. Of the green grasses Conover\u0027s Colossal and Dreer\u0027s Eclipse are excellent sorts, and Columbian Mammoth White is a white variety that is good. If one wishes young plants for setting one can84 obtain them very easily by cutting the tops of asparagus when the berries are nearly ripe and piling them in some convenient place where the ground is mellow and free from weeds and grass and leaving them undisturbed for a year; the seeds will germinate and produce a large quantity of thrifty young plants that later may be taken up and set where desired, and all without any care or labor further than the cutting of the tops. One may begin cutting the asparagus when the bed is two years old, though small stalks will be produced at that age. Cutting at this age should not extend over a period of two weeks and in an established bed should be limited to four. All small stalks should be cut and not allowed to grow during the cutting period as they would exhaust the plant if allowed to grow, but when the cutting period is over they should, of course, be allowed to grow. Salt was formerly considered essential to successful asparagus culture and certainly does no harm, but its chief value is in keeping down weeds and this can be quite as successfully done by85 hand cultivation; this is better than to form the habit of depending on some quick, laborless road to clean beds—in the annals of gardening \"There ain\u0027t no such animule.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1921/55223.html","bookId":886,"book":{"id":886,"title":"The Busy Woman\u0027s Garden Book","description":"简介： This little book has a very definite aima big aim too, though two little words or even one will serve to define itTo help, or better still, perhapshelpfulness.
