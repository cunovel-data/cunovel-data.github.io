{"id":78952,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"And where in God\u0027s name would she have heard the roar of lions? Lyon knew he was becoming obsessed with finding out about her past. His determination didn\u0027t make much sense to him. Christina was affecting him in ways he\u0027d thought impossible. He\u0027d never felt so overwhelmed by a woman before. The admission bothered him far more than the nagging pain in his knee. He would learn all her secrets. She was sure to have them—every woman did—and then his curiosity would be satisfied. Yes, then he\u0027d dismiss her. The obsession would end. With that decision reached, Lyon dispatched notes to the gossip leaders of the ton. He was, of course, discreet in his requests for information about the Princess, using his sister Diana and her introduction into society as his main reason for wanting to know the ins and outs of \"business.\" He wasn\u0027t the least concerned about his deceitful endeavor. And in the end, when all the letters had been answered, Lyon was more frustrated than ever. According to all those in the know, Princess Christina didn\u0027t have a past. The woman hadn\u0027t even existed until two months ago. Lyon wasn\u0027t about to accept such a conclusion. His patience was running thin. He wanted real answers… and he wanted to see Christina again. He had thought to corner her at Creston\u0027s ball the following Saturday, then decided against waiting. Ignoring good manners altogether, he called upon No. 6 Baker Street at the unholy hour of nine o\u0027clock in the morning. Lyon hadn\u0027t bothered to send a note begging an audience, certain the ill-tempered Countess would have denied him entrance if she\u0027d been given advance warning. Luck was on Lyon\u0027s side. An extremely feeble old man with a mop of stark yellow hair opened the door for him. His clothing indicated that he was the butler, and his manner resembled that of an uncivil pontiff. \"The Countess has just left for an appointment, sir, and won\u0027t return home for a good hour or more.\" Lyon held his grin. \"I don\u0027t want to see the Countess,\" he told the butler. \"Then who exactly did you want to see?\" the servant asked in a haughty tone of voice. Lyon let his exasperation show. The old man guarded the entrance like a gargoyle. Lyon brushed past him before he could issue a protest, calling over his shoulder, \"I wish to speak to Princess Christina.\" He deliberately used his most intimidating voice to gain compliance. \"Now.\" A sudden grin transformed the servant\u0027s dour expression into wrinkles of delight. \"The Countess ain\u0027t going to like it,\" he announced as he shuffled ahead of Lyon to the double doors on the left of the entry way. \"She\u0027ll be displeased, she will.\" \"You don\u0027t seem too disturbed by that eventuality,\" Lyon remarked dryly when the butler let out a loud cackle. \"I won\u0027t be telling her about your visit, sir,\" the butler said. He drew himself up and turned toward the staircase. \"You can wait in there,\" he said with a wave of his hand. \"I\u0027ll go and inform the Princess of your wish to speak to her.\" \"Perhaps it would be better if you don\u0027t tell your mistress who her caller is,\" Lyon instructed, thinking Christina just might decide against seeing him. \"I\u0027d like to surprise her,\" he added. \"Since you ain\u0027t given me your name, it\u0027ll be easy enough to comply with your wishes.\" It seemed to Lyon that it took an eternity for the butler to make it across the hallway. He leaned against the door frame and watched the old man. A sudden question made him call out, \"If you don\u0027t know who I am, how can you be so sure the Countess will be displeased?\" The butler let out another crackle of laughter that sounded very like a long nail being dragged across a chalkboard. The effort nearly toppled him to the floor. He grabbed hold of the bannister before giving Lyon an answer. \"It doesn\u0027t matter who you be, sir. The Countess don\u0027t like anyone. Nothing ever makes the old bat happy.\" The butler continued up the stairs in his slow, sluggish stride. Lyon would have sworn it took the old man ten minutes to gain three steps. \"I take it the Countess wasn\u0027t the one who employed you,\" Lyon remarked. \"No, sir,\" the servant answered between wheezes. \"It was Princess Christina who found me in the gutter, so to speak. She picked me up, dusted me off, and fixed me up real nice in new clothes. I was a butler many years ago, afore hard times caught me.\" The old man took a deep breath, then added, \"The Princess don\u0027t like me calling her aunt an old bat, though. Says it ain\u0027t dignified.\" \"It might not be dignified, my good man, but old bat really does describe the Countess rather well.\" The butler nodded, then grabbed hold of the bannister again. He stayed in that position a long moment. Lyon thought the man was trying to catch his breath. He was wrong in that conclusion, however. The butler finally let go of the railing, then cupped his hands to the sides of his mouth and literally bellowed his announcement up the stairwell. \"You got yourself a visitor, Princess. I put him in the drawing room.\" Lyon couldn\u0027t believe what he\u0027d just witnessed. When the servant repeated the scream, he started laughing. The butler turned back to explain to Lyon. \"She don\u0027t want me overdoing,\" he said. \"Got to save me strength for the old bat\u0027s orders.\" Lyon nodded. The butler shouted to his mistress again. Christina suddenly appeared at the top of the steps, drawing Lyon\u0027s full attention. He wasn\u0027t ever going to get used to looking at her, he decided. She kept getting prettier. Her hair wasn\u0027t pinned atop her head today. Glorious. It was the only word that came to mind, for the thick, silvery mass of curls framing the angelic face defied any other description. When she started down the steps, Lyon saw that the length of hair ended against the swell of her slender hips. She was dressed in a pale pink gown. The scoop neckline showed only a hint of the swell of her bosom. There was something a little unusual about the modest ensemble, but Lyon was too distracted watching her smile at her butler to decide what seemed out of place to him. She hadn\u0027t seen him yet. \"Thank you, Elbert. Now go and sit down. The Countess will be home soon, and you\u0027ll have to be on your feet again.\" \"You\u0027re too good to me,\" Elbert whispered. \"It is good of you to think so,\" she said before continuing on down the steps. She spotted Lyon leaning against the entrance to the salon. He knew she was surprised. Her eyes widened. \"Oh, dear, the Countess is going to be—\" \"Displeased,\" Lyon finished her comment with an exasperated sigh. Elbert had obviously heard the remark. His scratchy laughter followed Christina into the drawing room. Lyon followed her, pausing long enough to shut the door behind him. \"Believe it or not, Christina, I\u0027m considered pleasing enough by the rest of the town. Why your aunt takes exception to me is beyond my comprehension.\" Christina smiled over the irritation she\u0027d caught in Lyon\u0027s voice. He sounded like a little boy in need of assurance. She sat down in the center of the gold brocade settee so Lyon couldn\u0027t sit beside her, motioned for him to take the chair adjacent to her, and then said, \"Of course you\u0027re pleasing. Do not let my aunt\u0027s opinions upset you. Though it is rude of me to admit, your feelings are surely at stake, and so I will confess that my aunt doesn\u0027t really like too many people.\" \"You mistake my comment,\" Lyon drawled out. \"I don\u0027t give a damn what your aunt thinks of me. I just find it puzzling that I…\" She was giving him a wary look, and he paused in his reply to change the topic. \"Are you unhappy I called?\" he asked, frowning over his own question. Christina shook her head. \"Good day to you,\" she suddenly blurted, trying to remember her manners. It was a problem for her, of course, because Lyon was looking wonderfully handsome again. He was dressed in buckskin riding pants that were the color of a young deer. The material clung to his powerful thighs. His shirt was white, probably made of silk, Christina thought, and partially covered by a forest-in-autumn-colored brown jacket that nicely matched the color of his shiny Hessian boots. She realized she was staring at him, yet decided to excuse her ill conduct because he was looking at her with much the same intensity. \"I like looking at you.\" \"I like looking at you, too,\" Lyon answered with a chuckle. Christina folded her hands in her lap. \"Was there a specific reason for your sporadic visitation?\" she asked. \"Sporadic? I don\u0027t understand…\" \"Spontaneous,\" Christina said hastily. \"I see.\" \"Well, sir? Was there a specific reason?\" \"I don\u0027t remember,\" Lyon answered, grinning at her. She gave him a hesitant smile back. \"Would you care for refreshment?\" \"No, thank you,\" Lyon answered. \"Well, then, kindly explain what it is you don\u0027t remember,\" she instructed. She gave him an expectant look, as if what she\u0027d just requested was the most logical thing in the world. \"How can I explain what it is I don\u0027t remember?\" he asked. \"You\u0027re back to making little sense again, aren\u0027t you?\" His smile could melt snow. Christina was having difficulty sitting still. All she wanted to think about was the way Lyon had kissed her, and all she wanted to do was find a way to get him to kiss her again. It was, of course, an unladylike thought. \"The weather has turned warm, hasn\u0027t it? Some people say it\u0027s the warmest autumn in many years,\" she added, staring intently down at her hands. Lyon smiled over her obvious nervousness. He slowly stretched out his long legs, settling in for a confrontation. It was going to be easy work finding out his answers if Christina remained this ill at ease. The tips of Lyon\u0027s boots touched the hem of her gown. She immediately scooted back against the settee, glanced down at the floor, and let out a small gasp. \"Would you care for refreshments?\" she asked in a surprisingly loud voice, jerking her gaze back to him. She wiggled to the edge of the settee again. She was as skittish as an abandoned kitten. \"You\u0027ve already asked me that question,\" Lyon reminded her. \"No, I don\u0027t care for refreshments. Do I make you uncomfortable?\" he added, grinning enough to let her know he\u0027d be happy if he did. \"Why would you think that?\" Christina asked. \"You\u0027re sitting on the edge of the cushion, looking ready to run at any second, my sweet.\" \"My name is Christina, not sweet,\" she said. \"And of course I\u0027m uncomfortable. You\u0027d make a buffalo nervous.\" \"A buffalo?\" \"You\u0027d make anyone nervous when you frown,\" Christina explained with a dainty shrug. \"Good.\" \"Good? Why, Lyon, you do say the oddest things.\" \"I say…\" Lyon shouted with laughter. \"Christina, you haven\u0027t made any sense since the moment I met you. Every time I see you I promise myself I\u0027ll get a normal conversation out of you, and then—\" \"Lyon, you\u0027re being fanciful,\" Christina interrupted. \"This is only the second—no, the third time I\u0027ve seen you, if you count two times in one evening—\" \"You\u0027re doing it again,\" Lyon said. \"Doing what?\" \"Trying to push me off center.\" \"I couldn\u0027t push you anywhere. You\u0027re too big. I know my strengths, Lyon.\" \"Do you take everything in literal meaning?\" \"I don\u0027t know. Do I?\" \"Yes.\" \"Perhaps you\u0027re the one who has trouble making sense. Yes,\" Christina added with a quick nod. \"You see, Lyon, you don\u0027t ask logical questions.\" She laughed when he glared. \"Why are you here?\" she asked again. She was back to staring at her hands again. A faint blush covered her cheeks. She was suddenly embarrassed about something. He didn\u0027t have any idea what or why. That didn\u0027t surprise him, though. The unusual was becoming commonplace where Christina was concerned. Lyon thought he was ready for just about anything now. He was confident he\u0027d have her game found out before the end of their visit. \"I really do know why you came to see me,\" Christina whispered timidly. \"Oh?\" Lyon asked. \"What is that reason?\" \"You like being with me,\" she answered, daring a quick look up to see his reaction. When he didn\u0027t seem irritated by her honesty, she warmed to her topic. \"Lyon? Do you believe in destiny?\" Oh, dear, he was looking confused again. Christina let out a long sigh. \"Well, you do admit you like being with me, don\u0027t you?\" she coached. \"Yes, but God only knows why,\" Lyon confessed. He leaned forward and rested his elbows on his knees. \"Yes, the Great Spirit does know why.\" \"Great Spirit?\" Lyon shook his head. \"Lord, I\u0027m starting to sound like an echo. All right, I\u0027ll ask. Who is this Great Spirit?\" \"God, of course. Different cultures have their own names for the All Powerful, Lyon. Surely you know that. You aren\u0027t a heathen, are you?\" She sounded quite appalled at that possibility. \"No, I\u0027m not a heathen.\" \"Well, you needn\u0027t get irritated with me. I only asked.\" He stared at her a long, silent minute. Then he stood up. Before Christina knew what he was going to do, he\u0027d pulled her up into his arms. He hugged her to him and rested his chin against the top of her head. \"I\u0027m either going to strangle you or kiss you,\" he announced. \"The choice is yours.\" Christina sighed. \"I would prefer that you kiss me. But first, please answer my question, Lyon. It\u0027s important to me.\" \"What question?\" \"I asked you if you believed in destiny,\" she said. She pulled away from him and looked up at his face. \"You really do have trouble holding a thought, don\u0027t you?\" She had the gall to sound disgruntled. \"I don\u0027t have any trouble holding a thought,\" he muttered. Christina didn\u0027t look like she believed him. She was a witch, trying to cast her magical spell on him. Lyon felt as besotted as a silly, worthless fop and as puny as an infant when her gaze was directed on him so enchantingly. \"Well?\" \"Well what?\" Lyon asked. He shook his head over his ridiculous reaction to the nymph glaring up at him. A lock of hair fell forward, concealing a part of his scar. Christina quit trying to pull away from him and reached up to smooth the lock back in place. The gentle touch jarred him back to her question.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lion-s-lady-crown-s-spies-1/page-12.html","bookId":1792,"book":{"id":1792,"title":"The Lion\u0027s Lady (Crown\u0027s Spies #1)","description":"Storyline: Christina Bennett had taken London society by storm.
