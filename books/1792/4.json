He argued in favor of caution, for he knew, as well as everyone else in their isolated village, that Christina would one day return to the world of the whites. And in his heart, the truth tormented him. He knew, with a certainty he couldn\u0027t deny, that there were no warriors like his father in this place called England. None at all. Chapter One London, England, 1810 Lettie\u0027s screams were getting weaker. Baron Winters, the physician in attendance to the Marchioness of Lyonwood, leaned over his patient and frantically tried to grab hold of her hands. The beautiful woman was writhing in agony. She was clearly out of her head now and seemed determined to tear the skin off her distended abdomen. \"There, there, Lettie,\" the physician whispered in what he hoped was a soothing tone. \"It\u0027s going to be all right, my dear. Just a bit longer and you\u0027ll have a fine babe to give your husband.\" The baron wasn\u0027t at all certain Lettie even understood what he was saying to her. Her emerald-green eyes were glazed with pain. She seemed to be staring right through him. \"I helped bring your husband into this world. Did you know that, Lettie?\" Another piercing scream interrupted his attempt to calm his patient. Winters closed his eyes and prayed for guidance. His forehead was beaded with perspiration, and his hands were actually shaking. In all his years, he\u0027d never seen such a difficult laboring. It had gone on much too long already. The Marchioness was growing too weak to help. The door to the bedroom slammed open then, drawing the baron\u0027s attention. Alexander Michael Phillips, the Marquess of Lyonwood, filled the doorway. Winters sighed with relief. \"Thank God you\u0027re home,\" he called out. \"We were worried you wouldn\u0027t return in time.\" Lyon rushed over to the bed. His face showed his concern. \"For God\u0027s sake, Winters, it\u0027s too early for this to happen yet.\" \"The baby has decided otherwise,\" Winters replied. \"Can\u0027t you see she\u0027s in terrible pain?\" he shouted. \"Do something!\" \"I\u0027m doing everything I can,\" Winters yelled back before he could control his anger. Another spasm caught Lettie, and her scream turned Winter\u0027s attention back to her. The physician\u0027s shoulders heaved forward with his effort of restraining her. The Marchioness wasn\u0027t a small woman by any means. She was extremely tall and well rounded. She fought the physician\u0027s hold on her shoulders with a vengeance. \"She\u0027s out of her mind, Lyon. Help me tie her hands to the posts,\" Winters ordered. \"No,\" Lyon shouted, clearly appalled by such a command. \"I\u0027ll hold her still. Just be done with it, Winters. She can\u0027t take much more. God, how long has she been this way?\" \"Over twelve hours now,\" Winters confessed. \"The midwife sent for me a few hours ago. She ran off in a panic when she realized the baby isn\u0027t in the proper position for birthing,\" he added in a whisper. \"We\u0027re going to have to wait it out and pray the baby turns for us.\" Lyon nodded as he took hold of his wife\u0027s hands. \"I\u0027m home now, Lettie. Just a little longer, my love. It will be over soon.\" Lettie turned toward the familiar voice. Her eyes were dull, lifeless. Lyon continued to whisper encouragement to his wife. When she closed her eyes and he believed she was asleep, he spoke to Winters again. \"Is it because the baby is almost two months early that Lettie is having so much difficulty?\" The physician didn\u0027t answer him. He turned his back on the Marquess to lift another cloth from the water basin. His motions were controlled, angry, but his touch was gentle when he finally placed the cool cloth on his patient\u0027s brow. \"God help us if she gets the fever,\" he muttered to himself. Lettie\u0027s eyes suddenly opened. She stared up at Baron Winters. \"James? Is that you, James? Help me, please help me. Your baby is tearing me apart. It\u0027s God\u0027s punishment for our sins, isn\u0027t it, James? Kill the bastard if you have to, but rid me of it. Lyon will never know. Please, James, please.\" The damning confession ended with a hysterical whimper. \"She doesn\u0027t know what she\u0027s saying,\" Winters blurted once he\u0027d recovered his composure. He wiped the blood away from Lettie\u0027s lips before adding, \"Your wife is delirious, Lyon. The pain rules her mind. Pay no heed to her rantings.\" Baron Winters glanced over to look at the Marquess. When he saw the expression on Lyon\u0027s face, he knew his speech hadn\u0027t swayed the man. The truth had won out after all. Winters cleared his throat and said, \"Lyon, quit this room. I\u0027ve work to do here. Go and wait in your study. I\u0027ll come for you when it\u0027s over.\" The Marquess continued to stare at his wife. When he finally lifted his gaze and nodded to the physician, his eyes showed his torment. He shook his head then, a silent denial, perhaps, of what he\u0027d just heard, and abruptly left the room. His wife\u0027s screams for her lover followed him out the door. It was finished three hours later. Winters found Lyon in the library. \"I did everything I could, Lyon. God help me, I lost both of them.\" The baron waited several minutes before speaking again. \"Did you hear what I said, Lyon?\" \"Was the baby two months early?\" Lyon asked. Winters didn\u0027t immediately answer. He was slow to recover from the flat, emotionless tone in Lyon\u0027s voice. \"No, the baby wasn\u0027t early,\" he finally said. \"You\u0027ve been lied to enough, son. I\u0027ll not add to their sins.\" The baron collapsed in the nearest chair. He watched Lyon calmly pour him a drink, then reached forward to accept the glass. \"You\u0027ve been like a son to me, Lyon. If there is anything I can do to help you through this tragedy, only tell me and I\u0027ll do it.\" \"You\u0027ve given me the truth, old friend,\" Lyon answered. \"That is enough.\" Winters watched Lyon lift his goblet and down the contents in one long swallow. \"Take care of yourself, Lyon. I know how much you loved Lettie.\" Lyon shook his head. \"I\u0027ll recover,\" he said. \"I always do, don\u0027t I, Winters?\" \"Yes,\" Winters answered with a weary sigh. \"The lessons of brotherhood have no doubt prepared you for any eventuality.\" \"There is one task I would give you,\" Lyon said. He reached for the inkwell and pen. Long minutes passed while Lyon wrote on a sheet of paper. \"I\u0027ll do anything,\" Winters said when he couldn\u0027t stand the silence any longer. Lyon finished his note, folded the sheet, and handed it to the physician. \"Take the news to James, Winters. Tell my brother his mistress is dead.\" Chapter Two Your father was such a handsome man, Christina. He could have chosen any woman in England. Yet he wanted me. Me! I couldn\u0027t believe my good fortune. I was only pretty enough to be passable by the ton\u0027s measure, terribly shy and naive, the complete opposite of your father. He was so sophisticated, so very polished, kind and loving, too. Everyone thought he was the most wonderful man. But it was all a terrible lie. Journal entry August 1, 1795 London, England, 1814 It was going to be a long night. The Marquess of Lyonwood let out a controlled sigh and leaned against the mantel of Lord Carlson\u0027s receiving room. It wasn\u0027t a casual stance but one employed for necessity\u0027s sake. By shifting his considerable weight, Lyon was able to ease the throbbing in his leg. The injury was still a constant irritant, and the sharp pain radiating up through his kneecap did absolutely nothing to lighten his somber mood. Lyon was attending the party under duress, having been successfully nagged into doing his duty by escorting his younger sister, Diana, to the event. Needless to say, he wasn\u0027t at all happy about his circumstances. He thought he should try to affect a pleasant expression on his face, yet couldn\u0027t quite manage that feat. Lyon was simply in too much pain to care if others noticed his sour disposition or not. He settled on a scowl instead, his usual expression these days, then folded his arms across his massive chest in a gesture of true resignation. The Earl of Rhone, Lyon\u0027s good friend since Oxford pranks, stood beside him. Both were considered handsome men. Rhone was dark-haired, fair-skinned, and stood six feet in height. He was built on the lean side, always impeccable in dress and taste, and gifted with a lopsided smile that made the young ladies forget all about his crooked nose. They were simply too mesmerized by his enviable green eyes to notice. Rhone was definitely a lady\u0027s man. Mothers fretted over his reputation, fathers worried about his intentions, while unseasoned daughters ignored their parents\u0027 cautions altogether, competing quite brazenly for his attention. Rhone drew women to his side in much the same way honey drew a hungry bear. He was a rascal, true, yet too irresistible to deny. Lyon, on the other hand, had the dubious distinction of being able to send these same sweetly determined ladies screaming for cover. It was an undisputed fact that the Marquess of Lyonwood could clear a room with just one glacial stare. Lyon was taller than Rhone by a good three inches. Because he was so muscular in chest, shoulders, and thighs, he gave the appearance of being even larger. His size alone wasn\u0027t enough to thoroughly intimidate the stronger-hearted ladies hoping to snatch a title, however. Neither were his features, if you could take them just one at a time. Lyon\u0027s hair was a dark golden color, given to curl. The length was left unfashionably longer than society liked. His profile mimicked the statues of Roman soldiers lining Carlton House. His cheekbones were just as patrician, his nose just as classical, and his mouth just as perfectly sculptured. The warm color of his hair was Lyon\u0027s only soft feature, however. His brown eyes mirrored cold cynicism. Disillusionment had molded his expression into a firm scowl. The scar didn\u0027t help matters much, either. A thin, jagged line slashed across his forehead, ending abruptly in the arch of his right eyebrow. The mark gave Lyon a piratical expression. And so the gossip makers called Rhone a rake and Lyon a pirate, but never, of course, to either gentleman\u0027s face. These foolish women didn\u0027t realize how their insults would have pleased both men. A servant approached the Marquess and said, \"My lord? Here is the brandy you requested.\" The elderly man made the announcement with a formal bow as he balanced two large goblets on a silver tray. Lyon grabbed both glasses, handed one to Rhone, and then surprised the servant by offering his gratitude. The servant bowed again before turning and leaving the gentlemen alone. Lyon emptied his glass in one long swallow. Rhone caught the action. \"Is your leg bothering you?\" he asked, frowning with concern. \"Or is it your intention to get sotted?\" \"I never get sotted,\" Lyon remarked. \"The leg is healing,\" he added with a shrug, giving his friend a roundabout answer. \"You came away lucky this time, Lyon,\" Rhone said. \"You\u0027re going to be out of commission for a good six months, maybe more. Thank God for that,\" he added. \"Richards would have you back in jeopardy tomorrow if he could have his way. I do believe it was a blessing your ship was destroyed. You can\u0027t very well go anywhere until you build another.\" \"I knew the risks,\" Lyon answered. \"You don\u0027t like Richards, do you, Rhone?\" \"He never should have sent you on that last little errand, my friend.\" \"Richards places government business above personal concerns.\" \"Above our personal concerns, you mean to say,\" Rhone corrected. \"You really should have gotten out when I did. If you weren\u0027t so vital to—\" \"I\u0027ve quit, Rhone.\" His friend couldn\u0027t contain his astonishment. Lyon knew he should have waited to give him the news, for there was a real concern Rhone would let out a shout. \"Don\u0027t look so stunned, Rhone. You\u0027ve been after me to retire for a good while now.\" Rhone shook his head. \"I\u0027ve been after you because I\u0027m your friend and very likely the only one who cares what happens to you,\" he said. \"Your special talents have kept you doing your duty longer than a normal man could stand. God\u0027s truth, I wouldn\u0027t have had the stomach for it. Do you really mean it? You\u0027ve actually retired? Have you told Richards?\" Rhone was speaking in a furious whisper. He watched Lyon intently. \"Yes, Richards knows. He isn\u0027t too pleased.\" \"He\u0027ll have to get used to it,\" Rhone muttered. He raised his glass in salutation. \"A toast, my friend, to a long life. May you find happiness and peace. You deserve a bit of both, Lyon.\" Since Lyon\u0027s glass was empty, he didn\u0027t share in the toast. He doubted Rhone\u0027s fervent wish would come true anyway. Happiness—in sporadic doses, of course—was a true possibility. But peace… no, the past would never allow Lyon to find peace. Why, it was as impossible a goal as love. Lyon accepted his lot in life. He had done what he believed was necessary, and part of his mind harbored no guilt. It was only in the dark hours of the night, when he was alone and vulnerable, that the faces from the past came back to haunt him. No, he\u0027d never find peace. The nightmares wouldn\u0027t let him. \"You\u0027re doing it again,\" Rhone announced, nudging Lyon\u0027s arm to gain his attention. \"Doing what?\" \"Frowning all the ladies out of the room.\" \"It\u0027s good to know I\u0027ve still got the ability,\" Lyon drawled. Rhone shook his head. \"Well, are you going to frown all night?\" \"Probably.\" \"Your lack of enthusiasm is appalling. I\u0027m in a wonderful mood. The new season always stirs my blood. Your sister must also be eager for all the adventures,\" he added. \"Lord, it\u0027s difficult to believe the little brat has finally grown up.\" \"Diana is excited,\" Lyon admitted. \"She\u0027s old enough to start looking for a husband.\" \"Is she still… spontaneous? It\u0027s been over a year now since I last saw her.\" Lyon smiled over Rhone\u0027s inept description of his sister\u0027s conduct. \"If you mean to ask me if she still charges into situations without showing the least amount of restraint, then yes, she\u0027s still spontaneous.\" Rhone nodded. He looked around the room, then let out a sigh. \"Just think of it. A fresh crop of beautiful ladies waiting to be sampled. In truth, I thought their mamas would have made them stay home, what with Jack and his band of robbers still on the prowl.\" \"I heard the thieves visited Wellingham last week,\" Lyon commented.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lion-s-lady-crown-s-spies-1/page-4.html","bookId":1792,"book":{"id":1792,"title":"The Lion\u0027s Lady (Crown\u0027s Spies #1)","description":"Storyline: Christina Bennett had taken London society by storm.
