{"id":78977,"no":37,"title":"Page 37","content":"\"I have still to speak to Mr. Bleak,\" Christina said. \"Unhand me, Lyon,\" she added, trying to jerk her hand away.\n \"Perhaps you didn\u0027t get it after all,\" Lyon remarked over his shoulder. \"I just told you that a wife goes where her husband—\"\n \"Lyon? I\u0027m ready to kill with curiosity,\" Bryan interposed. He\u0027d caught the irritation in his friend\u0027s voice and was trying to intervene before another conflict started. \"I would like to know why your wife came here,\" he added with an embarrassed stammer.\n Lyon paused at the door. \"Tell him,\" he ordered Christina.\n She wished she could deny his command so that he would realize she\u0027d meant every word of what she\u0027d said to him, but Rhone\u0027s well-being was at issue, so she put her pride aside. \"Rhone is having a party tonight,\" she began. \"I wanted to ask you if you could find some good men to act as mischief makers and—\"\n Christina never finished her explanation. Lyon dragged her out the door in the middle of her sentence. They walked halfway around the block before his carriage came into view. No wonder she hadn\u0027t known he was visiting Bryan, she thought to herself. The man had hidden his vehicle a good distance away.\n She didn\u0027t understand his reason, yet she wasn\u0027t about to question him. Her voice might betray her. Christina knew she was close to weeping. She didn\u0027t think she\u0027d ever been this angry in all her life.\n Neither said a word to the other until they were home. Lyon used the time to try to calm down. It was a difficult endeavor. He couldn\u0027t quit thinking about what could have happened to Christina. The unwanted images fueled his temper. God help him, his knees had nearly buckled under him when he\u0027d first spotted Christina in the tavern.\n She was playing cards with the worst thugs in London. She hadn\u0027t realized her jeopardy, of course; she couldn\u0027t have. She wouldn\u0027t have looked so pleased with herself if she had. And she had smiled at him. Lyon didn\u0027t think he\u0027d ever been so furious… or so frightened.\n \"You\u0027re too damned innocent for your own good,\" he muttered after he\u0027d jerked the door to the carriage open.\n Christina wouldn\u0027t look at him. She kept her gaze directed on her lap, and when he made his unkind remark she merely shrugged her shoulders in indifference.\n He offered her his hand when she climbed out of the vehicle. She ignored it.\n It wasn\u0027t until she\u0027d raced on ahead of him that he realized she\u0027d cut a portion of her hair. The curls ended in the middle of her back now.\n Brown met them at the door. After giving his butler instructions to watch over his wife, he chased after Christina. She was halfway up the staircase when he stopped her. \"When I\u0027m not too angry to speak of this matter, I will explain to you why—\"\n \"I don\u0027t wish to hear your reasons,\" Christina interrupted.\n Lyon closed his eyes and took a deep breath. \"Don\u0027t you dare venture out again until tomorrow morning,\" he told her. \"I have to go to Rhone\u0027s now.\"\n \"I see.\"\n \"No, I don\u0027t think you do see,\" Lyon muttered. \"Christina, you went to Bryan to ask his help in finding men to masquerade as Jack and his friends, didn\u0027t you?\"\n She nodded.\n \"Wife, you have little faith in me,\" Lyon whispered, shaking his head.\n Christina believed his comment was ridiculous. \"Faith has nothing to do with my errand. I didn\u0027t know you\u0027d been informed of Rhone\u0027s terror.\"\n \"Terror?\"\n \"He\u0027s been barred inside his house,\" Christina explained. \"Since he is your friend, I thought of a most cunning plan. You ruined it,\" she added.\n \"No, you would have ruined it,\" Lyon announced. \"I\u0027ve already taken care of the problem, Christina. Now give me your word that you\u0027ll stay inside.\"\n \"I have no other errands to take care of,\" Christina answered.\n When he let go of her arm, Christina turned and rushed up the rest of the steps. Lyon was just walking out the front door when she called out to him.\n \"Lyon?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"You\u0027re going to have to apologize. Will you do it now or when you return from Rhone\u0027s house?\"\n \"Apologize?\"\n He\u0027d shouted the word at her. Christina concluded he wasn\u0027t contrite. \"Then you\u0027re going to have to start all over,\" she shouted back.\n \"What are you talking about? I don\u0027t have time for riddles,\" Lyon announced. \"If anyone\u0027s going to apologize…\"\n He didn\u0027t bother to finish his demand, for his wife had turned her back on him and disappeared down the hallway.\n She\u0027d just dismissed him again. Lyon didn\u0027t think he was ever going to get used to that action.\n He wasn\u0027t ever going to understand her, either. She had a devious mind. She\u0027d come up with the same plan he had to help Rhone. He couldn\u0027t help being impressed.\n Lord, the task ahead of him would certainly prove exhausting. He was going to have to go to great lengths to keep Christina safe. She\u0027d get into quick trouble if he wasn\u0027t always by her side, watching over her. Christina didn\u0027t seem to understand caution. Hell, she didn\u0027t even know enough to be afraid of him when his temper exploded.\n No woman had ever raised her voice to him… nor had many men, Lyon realized. Yet Christina certainly had. When he shouted at her, he got equal measure in return.\n She was his equal in all things. Her passion matched his own, and in his heart, he knew she loved him just as much.\n Yes, the next twenty years, God willing, were going to be exhausting.\n And very, very satisfying.\n Chapter Fifteen\n I didn\u0027t want any more innocent people to die because of me. Edward would come after us. I knew I\u0027d only been given a temporary stay of execution.\n When dawn arrived, I\u0027d only made it to the first peak. The wagon train was waking up. Would they send searchers out to find me?\n I saw the Indians pouring down the hill then and thought to scream a warning, but I knew they wouldn\u0027t be able to hear me. Then another scream came from behind me. It was a woman\u0027s voice. Edward! He was there, I believed. Another innocent would die because of me. I grabbed the knife Jacob kept in his saddle pocket and ran toward the sound.\n The sight that met me when I rushed through the trees broke through my cowardice, my fear. I saw a little boy, so battered, so bloody, crumbled like a fallen leaf on the ground. The woman who\u0027d screamed was silent now. Her hands and feet had been bound.\n Mother and child… like you and me, Christina… the attacker became Edward in my mind. I don\u0027t remember putting you down on the ground, don\u0027t know if I made a sound as I ran forward and plunged my knife into his back.\n The knife must have pierced his heart, for the attacker didn\u0027t struggle.\n I made certain he was dead, then turned to help the little boy. His whimpers of agony tore at me. I gently lifted the child into my arms to give him what little comfort I could. When I began to croon to him, his breathing deepened.\n I suddenly felt someone watching me. I turned and saw that the Indian woman was staring at me.\n Her name was Merry.\n Journal entry November 1, 1795\n Lyon didn\u0027t return to his townhouse until the early hours of the morning. It had been a thoroughly satisfying evening all around. The look on Rhone\u0027s face when he was being robbed by the man pretending to be Jack would live in Lyon\u0027s memory a good long while.\n Yes, it had all been worth his efforts. The charges against Rhone would be dropped by tomorrow at the latest. Everyone now believed Rhone\u0027s story that he\u0027d injured his wrist by accident when he\u0027d fallen on a piece of jagged glass.\n Wellingham had been made to look like a fool. That thought pleased Lyon. He wasn\u0027t through with that bastard—or the other three, for that matter—but Lyon knew he\u0027d have to wait before making their lives as miserable as he had planned. Rhone\u0027s father would be avenged. The four thieves were going to regret the day they\u0027d decided to make Rhone\u0027s family their target. Lyon would see to it.\n Christina was sound asleep on the floor next to his side of the bed. Lyon undressed quickly, then lifted his wife into his arms, careful to avoid being pricked by the knife under her blanket. Put her where she belonged—in his bed. He wrapped his arms around her until she was snuggled against his chest.\n He\u0027d have to do something about the soft mattresses, he supposed. He smiled as he remembered Christina telling him on their wedding night that the bed was trying to swallow her up.\n She hadn\u0027t fallen out of bed. No wonder she\u0027d laughed when he\u0027d announced that she had. Lyon fervently hoped she\u0027d get used to the bed. He didn\u0027t relish the idea of bedding down on the ground, but he would do it, he realized with a sigh, if it was the only way he could hold her.\n Compromise. The word whispered through his mind. It was a foreign concept to him. Until Christina. Perhaps now, he decided, it was time to practice it.\n Lyon was eager for morning to come. After explaining his reason for being so angry with her when he\u0027d found her at Bryan\u0027s tavern, he\u0027d ease into the issue of her safety. He\u0027d make her understand he only had her best interests at heart, and that she couldn\u0027t go flitting about town without proper escort.\n And she would learn to compromise.\n Lyon wasn\u0027t able to lecture his wife the following morning. She wasn\u0027t there to listen to him.\n He didn\u0027t wake up until noon—an amazing fact, for he rarely slept more than three hours at a stretch. He felt rested, ready to take on the world. More exactly, he was ready to take on his wife, and he hurried in his dress so that he could go downstairs to begin her instruction.\n Lyon had jumped to the erroneous conclusion that Christina would actually be waiting for him.\n \"What do you mean? She can\u0027t be gone!\"\n His bellow frightened the timid servant. \"The Marchioness left several hours ago, my lord,\" he stammered out. \"With Brown and the other men. Have you forgotten your orders to your wife? I heard the Marchioness tell Brown you had insisted she return to Lyonwood immediately.\"\n \"Yes, I did forget,\" Lyon muttered. He lied to his servant, of course. He hadn\u0027t given any such instructions. Yet he wasn\u0027t about to let a member of his staff know Christina wasn\u0027t telling the truth. It wasn\u0027t her character he was protecting but his own. Lyon didn\u0027t want anyone to know the lack of control he had over her.\n It was humiliating. Lyon grumbled about that sorry fact until a sudden thought made him cheer up a bit. Christina must have been nervous to leave so quickly. Perhaps she\u0027d realized the significance of her actions yesterday.\n Lyon at first thought to go to Lyonwood immediately, then decided to let Christina stew in her own worries for most of the day. By the time he arrived home she might even be contrite.\n Yes, time and silence were his allies. He hoped he\u0027d have her apology by nightfall.\n Lyon spent an hour going over estate details, then decided to stop by his mother\u0027s townhouse to tell Diana about Rhone. He was given a surprise when he barged into the drawing room and found Rhone sitting on the settee with his arm draped around Diana.\n \"Am I interrupting?\" he drawled.\n His entrance didn\u0027t seem to bother either one of them. Diana\u0027s head continued to rest on Rhone\u0027s shoulder, and his friend didn\u0027t even glance up.\n \"Here\u0027s Lyon now, sweetling. Quit crying. He\u0027ll know what\u0027s to be done.\"\n Lyon barked orders as he strode over to the fireplace. \"Rhone, get your arm off my sister. Diana, sit up and behave with a little decorum, for God\u0027s sake. What are you crying about?\"\n His sister tried to comply with his command, but as soon as she straightened up Rhone pulled her back, forcing the side of her cheek onto his shoulder again.\n \"You stay right there. I\u0027m comforting her, damn it, Lyon, and that\u0027s that.\"\n Lyon decided he\u0027d have to deal with his friend later. \"Tell me why you\u0027re crying, Diana. Now. I\u0027m in a hurry,\" he added.\n \"You don\u0027t need to raise your voice to her, Lyon.\" Rhone glared at his friend. \"She\u0027s had an upset.\"\n \"Will one of you please tell me what the hell the upset was?\"\n \"Mama.\" Diana wailed. She pulled away from Rhone to dab at her eyes with her lace handkerchief. \"Christina took her.\"\n \"She what?\" Lyon asked, shaking his head in confusion.\n \"Your wife took your mother to Lyonwood with her,\" Rhone said.\n \"And that\u0027s why Diana\u0027s crying?\" Lyon asked, trying to get to the bottom of the matter.\n Rhone was trying not to laugh. His eyes sparkled with merriment. \"It is,\" he said as he patted Diana\u0027s shoulder.\n Lyon sat down across from his sister and waited for her to get hold of herself. She looked like a butterfly, he thought, dressed in a yellow gown with brown trim. Her tears were making a mess of the gown.\n \"Diana,\" he said in what he hoped was a soothing voice, \"You needn\u0027t be afraid that I\u0027m angry because my wife took our mother with her. That\u0027s why you\u0027re crying, isn\u0027t it?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"You wanted Mother to stay here?\"\n When she shook her head and continued to sob, Lyon\u0027s patience wore out. \"Well?\"\n \"Mama didn\u0027t want to go,\" Diana cried. \"Rhone, you tell him. You saw what happened. I just don\u0027t know what to think. And Aunt Harriett laughing like a loon the whole time. Oh, I didn\u0027t know what—\"\n \"Rhone, do you care about Diana?\"\n \"I do. Very much.\"\n \"Then I suggest you quiet her down before I strangle her. Diana, stop that snorting.\"\n \"I\u0027ll explain, my sweet,\" Rhone told Diana in a tender, soothing voice.\n Lyon hid his exasperation. Rhone was acting like a lovesick puppy.\n \"Your mama denied Christina\u0027s request to go along with her to Lyonwood, you see. And that\u0027s when the fireworks began.\"\n Rhone couldn\u0027t control his smile. Diana was weeping into his jacket now, so he felt safe grinning. \"Your wife was very determined to take your mother with her. So determined, in fact, that she… well, she dragged your mother out of bed.\"\n \"You\u0027re jesting.\"\n \"Mama didn\u0027t want to go.\"\n \"Obviously,\" Lyon drawled. \"Did Christina explain her reasons for being so forceful?\"\n A smile pulled at the corners of his mouth, but his sister was watching him intently, and he didn\u0027t want to upset her further by letting her see his amusement.\n Rhone didn\u0027t help his determination to shield his sister\u0027s feelings. \"You should have seen it, Lyon. Your mother is a strong woman. I never realized that fact. I thought she\u0027d been languishing these past years, but she did put up quite a fight. Of course, that was only after…\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lion-s-lady-crown-s-spies-1/page-37.html","bookId":1792,"book":{"id":1792,"title":"The Lion\u0027s Lady (Crown\u0027s Spies #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Christina Bennett had taken London society by storm.
