{"id":82270,"no":45,"title":"Page 45","content":"On a morning in the summer of Mikhail\u0027s fourteenth year, as the sun warmed the earth and the forest bloomed green as young dreams, a black wolf ran.\\n\\n He knew the tricks now: Wiktor and Nikita had taught him. You propelled your body with the back legs, braked and turned with the front. You were always alert to the surface under your paws: soft dirt, mud, rocks, sand. all those called for different touches, different tensions of the body. Sometimes you kept your muscles tight as new springs, sometimes relaxed like old bands of rubber. But-and this was a very important lesson, Wiktor had said sternly-you remained constantly aware. That was a word Wiktor used many times, beating it into Mikhail\u0027s impatient brain like a bent nail. aware. Of your own body, the keen rumbling of the lungs, the pumping of the blood, the movement of muscles and sinews, and the rhythm of four legs. Of the sun in the sky, and the direction you were traveling. Of your surroundings, and how to get home again. Of not only the world in front of you, but what was happening to right, left, behind, above, and below. Of the scent trails of small game and the sounds of animals fleeing your own scent. aware of all these things and many more. Mikhail had never realized that being a wolf was such hard work.\\n\\n But it was becoming second nature. The pain of transformation had lessened, though Wiktor had told him it would never entirely go away. Pain, as Mikhail understood it, was a fact of life. Still, the pain of change paled before the utter, exuberant thrill that Mikhail felt whenever his body bounded on all fours through the forest, his muscles rippling beneath his flesh and the sensation of power beyond anything he\u0027d ever known. He was still a small wolf, but Wiktor said he\u0027d grow. He was a fast learner, Wiktor said. He had a good head on his shoulders. In these burning days of summer Mikhail spent most of his time in the shape of a wolf, feeling naked and pale as a maggot when he wore his boy skin. He slept very little; every day and night there were new explorations to make, new things to see from eyes that missed nothing. Objects that had been matter-of-factly familiar to his human vision were a revelation to his wolf\u0027s gaze: rain was a shower of shimmering colors, the tracks of small animals in high grass were edged with the faint blue of body heat, the wind itself seemed to be a complex living thing that brought news of other lives and deaths from across the forest.\\n\\n and the moon. Oh, the moon!\\n\\n The wolf\u0027s eye saw it differently. an endlessly fascinating silver hole in the night, sometimes edged with bright blue, sometimes crimson, sometimes a hue that was beyond description. The moonlight fell in silver spears, lighting the forest like a cathedral. It was the most beautiful glow Mikhail had ever seen, and in that awesome beauty the wolves-even three-legged Franco-gathered on high rocks and sang. The songs were paeans of mingled joy and sadness: We are alive, the songs said, and we wish to live forever. But life is a passing thing, as the moon passes across the sky, and all the eyes of wolves and men must grow dim, and close.\\n\\n But we\u0027ll sing, while there\u0027s such a light as this!\\n\\n Mikhail ran for the thrill of running. Sometimes, when he returned to human form after hours spent on four legs, he had trouble balancing on two. They were weak, white stalks, and you couldn\u0027t get them to go fast enough. Speed was what entranced Mikhail; the ability of movement, of cutting left and right and having a tail that acted like a rudder keeping your balance in turns. Wiktor said he was becoming too enraptured with his wolf\u0027s body, and neglecting his studies. It wasn\u0027t only the changing of shape that made the miracle, Wiktor told him; it was the brain in the wolf\u0027s skull that could follow a scent of an injured stag on the wind and recite Shakespeare at the same time.\\n\\n He burst through the underbrush and found a pond in a hollow rimmed with rocks. The fragrance of the cool water on such a hot, dusty day was a beckoning perfume. There were still some things a human boy could do better than a wolf, and one of them was swimming. He rolled in the soft grass for the mighty pleasure of it. Then he lay on his side, panting, and let the change come over him. How this worked exactly was still a mystery to him: it began by imagining himself as a boy, just as he imagined himself a wolf when he desired to change in the other direction. The more complete and detailed he saw himself in his mind\u0027s eye, the faster and smoother the change. It was a matter of concentration, of training the mind. Of course there were problems; sometimes an arm or leg refused to obey, and once his head had balked. all this led to much merriment for the other members of the pack, but considerable discomfort for Mikhail. But with practice he was getting better. as Wiktor told him, Rome wasn\u0027t built in a day.\\n\\n Mikhail leaped into the water, and it closed over his head. He came up spouting, and then he arched his white body and dove into the depths. as he stroked along the rocky bottom, he remembered how and where he\u0027d first learned to swim: as a child, under the tutelage of his mother, in a huge indoor pool in St. Petersburg. Had that been him, reallyi a pampered, shy youth who wore shirts with high starched collars and took piano lessonsi That seemed like a foreign world now, and all the people who had inhabited it had almost faded away. Nothing was real, except this life and the forest.\\n\\n He shot up to the surface, and as he shook the water from his hair he heard her laugh.\\n\\n Startled, he looked around and saw her. She was sitting on a rock, her long hair the color of spun gold in the sunlight. alekza was as naked as he, but her body was infinitely more interesting. \"Oh look!\" she said teasingly. \"What a minnow I\u0027ve found!\"\\n\\n Mikhail treaded water. \"What are you doing out herei\"\\n\\n \"What are you doing in therei\"\\n\\n \"Swimming,\" he answered. \"What does it look likei\"\\n\\n \"It looks silly. Cool, but silly.\"\\n\\n She couldn\u0027t swim, he thought. Had she followed him from the white palacei \"It is cool,\" he told her. \"Especially after you run.\" He could tell that alekza had been running; her body was moist with a fine sheen of sweat.\\n\\n alekza carefully eased down on the rock, reached forward, and cupped a hand into the water. She lifted it to her mouth and lapped it like an animal, then poured the rest of it over the golden down between her thighs. \"Oh yes,\" she said, and smiled at him. \"It is cool, isn\u0027t iti\"\\n\\n Mikhail was beginning to feel much warmer. He swam away from her, but it was a small pond. He swam in circles, pretending that he didn\u0027t even notice as she stretched out against the rock and offered her body to the sun. and, of course, to his gaze. He averted his face. What was wrong with himi Lately, through the spring and now into the summer, alekza had been much on his mind. Her blond hair, her ice-blue eyes when she was in her human form, her blond fur and proud tail when she was wolfen. The mystery between her thighs pulled at him. He\u0027d had dreams... no, no, those were indecent.\\n\\n \"You have a beautiful back,\" she told him. Her voice was soft; there was something pliable in it. \"It looks so strong.\"\\n\\n He swam a little faster. Maybe to make the muscles of his back tense, maybe not.\\n\\n \"When you come out,\" alekza said, \"I\u0027ll dry you off.\"\\n\\n Mikhail\u0027s penis had already guessed at how that was to be accomplished and grown hard as the rock alekza perched on. He kept swimming as alekza sunned herself and waited.\\n\\n He could stay in the pond until she got tired and went back home, he thought. She was an animal: that\u0027s what Renati said about her. But, as Mikhail\u0027s swimming began to slow and his heart pounded with an unknown passion, he knew his time with alekza would be soon, if not today. She wanted him, wanted what he had. and he was curious; there were lessons Wiktor could not teach. alekza was waiting, and the sun was hot. Its glare off the water made him feel dizzy. He made two more circles, turning the situation over in his mind. a vital part of him had already made its decision.\\n\\n He pulled himself out of the water, feeling a mixture of longing and fear as he watched alekza stand up, her breasts drawing tight as she looked at what he offered. She came down off the rock, and he stood in the grass and waited.\\n\\n She took his hand, guided him into the shade, and there he lay down on a bed of moss. She knelt beside him. alekza was beautiful, though up close Mikhail could see that lines had deepened around her eyes and at the corners of her mouth. The wolf\u0027s life was hard, and alekza was no longer a maiden. But her ice-blue eyes promised pleasures beyond his dreams, and she leaned forward and pressed her lips against his. He had a lot to learn about the art of love; his first lesson had begun.\\n\\n alekza made good her promise to dry him off, using her tongue. She began at the south and crawled ever so slowly northward, licking dry his legs, slowly lapping the water that beaded on his shivering skin.\\n\\n She came to his blood-gorged center, and there she displayed the true quality of an animal: the love of fresh meat. alekza engulfed him, as Mikhail moaned and sank his fingers into her hair. Like an animal also, she was fond of using her teeth, and she bit and licked up and down as pressure rapidly built in his loins. He heard a roaring in his head, and luminous streaks leaped through his brain like summer lightning. alekza\u0027s warm mouth held him, her fingers squeezing at the base of his testicles. He felt his body convulse, a movement that was beyond his control, and for a number of seconds his muscles tensed as if they were about to rip through the flesh. The lightning in his brain danced, striking his nerves and flaming them. He groaned: a bestial sound.\\n\\n alekza released her grip on him and watched the seed fountain from Mikhail\u0027s body. He convulsed a second time, and delivered another hot white explosion. She smiled, proud of her power over this young flesh; then, as Mikhail\u0027s banner began to droop, she continued her journey of the tongue across his stomach, over his chest, and playing circles around and around on his skin. Goose bumps seethed in the wake of her passage. Mikhail began to harden again, and as his mind cleared from its initial delirium he realized now that there was more to be learned than the monks had ever dreamed.\\n\\n Their mouths met, and lingered. alekza bit at his tongue and lips, she grasped his hands and placed them on her breasts, and then she sat astride his thighs and eased herself down on him. They were connected, a pulse clenched within moist heat. alekza\u0027s hips began a slow rhythm that gradually increased in power and intensity, her eyes staring into his and her face and breasts glistening with sweat. Mikhail was a fast student; he rocked deeper into her, meeting her movements, and as their thrusts became harder and more urgent, alekza threw back her head, her golden hair cascading around her shoulders, and cried out with joy.\\n\\n He felt her shudder, her eyes closed and her lips making soft moaning noises. She offered her breasts to his kisses, her hips moving in tight, hard circles, and then Mikhail was overcome by that uncontrollable convulsion again. as his muscles tensed and the blood roared through his veins, a bounty of his essence exploded into alekza\u0027s warm wetness. He felt stretched, his bones throbbing with swampy heat. The sky might have crashed down on his face like blue glass, and he wouldn\u0027t have cared. He drifted in an unknown land, but one thing he was certain of: he liked this place, very much. and he wanted to go back again as soon as he could manage the journey.\\n\\n He was ready again faster than he would have thought. Body to body, he and alekza rolled over the bed of moss, out of the shade and into the sunlight. Now she was underneath him, her legs up over his hips, and she laughed at his eagerness as he plunged deep again. This was better than swimming; he couldn\u0027t find the bottom of alekza\u0027s pond. The sun beat down on them, its heat making their flesh wet and melding them together. It burned away the last vestiges of Mikhail\u0027s shyness, as well, and he met her thrusts with steady power. Her thighs were pressed against his sides, her mouth urging at his tongue, his back arching as he stroked in her depths.\\n\\n as their bodies moved again through tension toward release, it happened without warning. Blond hair scurried over alekza\u0027s stomach, over her thighs and arms. She gasped, her eyes dazed with pleasure, and Mikhail caught her wild, pungent odor. That smell triggered the wolf in him, and black hair rippled over his back, underneath her clenching fingers. alekza contorted and began to change, her gritted teeth lengthening into fangs, her beautiful face taking on another form of beauty. Mikhail, still embraced within her, let himself go, too; black hair emerged over his shoulders, his arms, buttocks, and legs. Their bodies writhed in a mingling of passion and pain, and they turned and angled so the body that was becoming a black wolf was mounting the emergent blond wolf from behind. and in the instant before the change became complete, Mikhail shuddered as his seed entered alekza. The pleasure overwhelmed him, and he threw back his head and howled. alekza joined his singing, their voices combining in harmony, breaking apart and combining again: another kind of lovemaking.\\n\\n Mikhail pulled out of her. The spirit was still willing, but the black-haired testicles were drained. alekza rolled in the grass, then jumped up and ran in circles, snapping at her tail. Mikhail tried to run, too, but his legs gave way and he lay in the sun with his tongue hanging out. alekza nuzzled him, rolled him over, and licked his belly. He basked in the attention, his eyes heavy-lidded, and he thought that there would never be another day like this one.\\n\\n as the sun began to sink and the sky turned red, alekza picked up the scent of a rabbit in the breeze. She and Mikhail started following it, racing each other through the woods to see who could track down the rabbit first, and as they ran they bounded back and forth over each other, happy as any lovers on earth. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-wolf-s-hour-michael-gallatin-1/page-45.html","bookId":2469,"book":{"id":2469,"title":"The Wolf\u0027s Hour (Michael Gallatin #1)","description":"Storyline: The Wolf\u0027s Hour (Michael Gallatin #1) \\n This book is a remarkable tale of pulse-pounding excitement with a uniquely sympathetic, fascinating portrait of the werewolf as noble warrior-and conflicted being.
