{"id":82279,"no":54,"title":"Page 54","content":"Chesna\u0027s chauffeur had brought the Mercedes from the Reichkronen\u0027s garage to the courtyard, and as Wilhelm and Mouse loaded the suitcases into the trunk, Chesna and Michael paused in the lobby to say their goodbyes to the manager.\n \"I\u0027m so sorry about that dreadful accident,\" the florid-faced man said with a ceremonious wringing of his hands. \"I do hope you\u0027ll return to the Reichkronen for another visit, Baroni\"\n \"I\u0027ll look forward to it.\" Michael was clean and freshly shaved, and he wore a dark blue pin-striped suit with a white shirt and a gray-striped necktie. \"Besides, the accident was my own fault. I\u0027m afraid I... uh... was a little too relaxed to go roaming along the riverbank.\"\n \"Well, thank God for your presence of mind! I trust the brandy was satisfactoryi\"\n \"Oh, yes. It was fine, thank you.\" In Chesna\u0027s suite the maid would find a washcloth that looked as if it had been bitten almost in two, and a strip of the bed\u0027s bottom sheet now bandaged Michael\u0027s thigh.\n \"Friulein van Dorne, I wish you and the baron the best of luck,\" the manager said with a crisp bow. Chesna thanked him, and slid a generous amount of appreciation into the man\u0027s palm.\n Chesna and Michael walked through the lobby, arm in arm. Their plans were set: not for a honeymoon excursion, but for a flight to Norway. Michael felt pressure gnawing at him. Today was april 24, and Chesna had said they would need a week at the least to get their fuel stops and security precautions arranged through her anti-Nazi network. With the allied invasion of Europe set for the first week of June, time might become a critical factor.\n They were almost to the front entrance when Michael heard the thump of heavy footsteps coming up behind them. His muscles tensed, and Chesna felt the tension ripple through his body. a hand grasped his shoulder, stopping him about ten feet short of the doorway.\n Michael looked up, into the bland, square face of Boots. The huge man released Michael\u0027s shoulder. \"My apologies, Baron, Friulein,\" he said. \"But Colonel Blok would like to have a word with you, please.\"\n Blok strolled up, smiling, his hands in his pockets. \"ah, good! Boots caught you before you could get away! I had no idea you were leaving. I only found out when I tried to call your room, Chesna.\"\n \"We just decided about an hour ago.\" There was no hint of nervousness in her voice; a true professional, Michael thought.\n \"Reallyi Well, I can\u0027t say I\u0027m surprised. Because of the incident, I mean.\" His gray, lizard eyes moved to Michael and then, heavy-lidded, returned to Chesna. \"But surely you didn\u0027t plan on leaving before saying goodbye to mei I\u0027ve always thought of myself as part of your family, Chesna.\" His smile broadened. \"an uncle, perhaps, who meddles more than he ought to. Yesi\" He withdrew his right hand from his pocket. Held between the thumb and first finger was a golden feather. Michael recognized it, and his stomach clenched. Blok, still smiling, fanned himself with the hawk\u0027s feather. \"I\u0027d consider it an honor to take you both to lunch. Surely you weren\u0027t thinking of leaving before you ate, were youi\" The feather twitched back and forth, like a cat\u0027s whiskers.\n Chesna stood her ground, though her heart was pounding and she smelled disaster. \"My car\u0027s packed. We really should be going.\"\n \"I\u0027ve never known you to pass up a leisurely lunch, Chesna. Perhaps the baron\u0027s habits have rubbed off on youi\"\n Michael took the initiative. He held his hand out. \"Colonel Blok, it was very good meeting you. I hope you\u0027ll attend our weddingi\"\n Blok grasped Michael\u0027s hand and shook it. \"Oh, yes,\" the colonel said. \"Two events I never miss are weddings and funerals.\"\n Michael and Chesna went through the doorway and started down the granite stairs. The colonel and Boots followed. Mouse was waiting, holding the Mercedes\u0027s door open for Chesna, and Wilhelm was putting the last suitcase into the trunk.\n Blok\u0027s trying to stall us, Michael thought. Whyi The colonel had obviously found Blondi\u0027s carcass and other signs of an intruder in Sandler\u0027s suite. If he was going to make an arrest, why hadn\u0027t he done so alreadyi Michael walked Chesna around to her side of the Mercedes; Blok followed right behind them. Michael felt Chesna tremble. She also knew the game had taken a dangerous turn.\n Chesna was about to slide into the car when Blok reached past Michael and took her elbow. She looked at the colonel, the sun on her face.\n \"For old times\u0027 sake,\" Blok said, and he leaned forward and kissed her lightly on the cheek.\n \"Until later, Jerek,\" Chesna answered, regaining some of her composure. She got into the car and Mouse closed the door, then went around to open the door for Michael. Blok followed on his heels while Boots stood a few yards away.\n \"It\u0027s been a pleasure, Baron,\" Blok said. Michael got into the Mercedes, but Blok held the door. Wilhelm was sliding behind the wheel and putting the key into the ignition. \"I hope you and Chesna will enjoy the future you\u0027ve chosen.\" He glanced up toward the courtyard entrance. Michael had already heard it: the low growl of a vehicle approaching across the pontoon bridge. \"Oh, this I forgot!\" Blok smiled, his silver teeth gleaming. \"Sandler\u0027s servant got control of the train. They found Sandler\u0027s body, too. The poor man; an animal had already gotten to him. Now explain this to me, Baron: how could someone like you, a pampered civilian with no combat experience, have killed Harry Sandleri Unless, of course, you\u0027re not who you seem to bei\" His hand went to the inside of his black SS jacket, as a truck carrying a dozen Nazi soldiers entered the courtyard portal.\n Michael had no time to play the offended baron; he shoved his foot into the pit of the colonel\u0027s stomach and knocked him backward to the paving stones. as Blok fell, a pistol was already in his hand. Mouse saw the glint of the Luger\u0027s barrel, aiming at the baron. Something inside him roared, and he stepped into the line of fire and kicked at Blok\u0027s gun hand.\n There was a sharp crack! as the pistol went off, and in the next instant Blok\u0027s hand had been knocked open and the Luger spun away.\n Boots was coming. Michael raised up out of the car, grabbed Mouse, and hauled him in. \"Go!\" he shouted at Wilhelm, and the chauffeur sank his foot to the floorboard. as the Mercedes lunged forward, Michael slammed his door shut and a hobnailed boot knocked a dent in its metal the size of a dinner plate.\n \"Get the gun! Get the gun!\" Blok was yelling as he scrambled to his feet. Boots ran for the Luger and scooped it up.\n as Wilhelm tore the Mercedes across the courtyard, a bullet hit the rear windshield and showered Michael, Chesna, and Mouse with glass. \"Stop them!\" Blok commanded the soldiers. \"Stop that car!\" More shots were fired. The left rear tire blew. The front windshield shattered. and then the Mercedes was crossing the pontoon bridge, its engine screaming and steam spouting from a bullet hole in the hood. Michael looked back, saw several of the soldiers running after them as the truck turned around in the courtyard. Rifles and submachine guns fired, and the Mercedes shuddered under the blows. The car reached the opposite bank, but the right rear tire exploded and now flames were licking up around the hood. \"The engine\u0027s going to blow!\" Wilhelm shouted as he watched the oil-gauge needle plummet and the temperature-gauge needle riot past the red line. The rear end was slewing back and forth, and he could hold the wheel no longer. The Mercedes went off the road and into the forest, angling down an incline and crashing through thick underbrush. Wilhelm fought the brakes, and the Mercedes grazed past an oak tree and came to rest amid a stand of evergreens.\n \"Everyone out!\" Wilhelm told them. He opened the driver\u0027s door, grasped its arm rest, and popped a latch beneath it. The door\u0027s leather interior covering fell away, exposing a compartment that held a submachine gun and three ammunition clips. as Michael got out of the car and pulled Mouse along with him, Chesna opened a compartment beneath the rear seat that yielded a Luger. \"This way!\" Wilhelm said, motioning them farther down the incline into thicker tangles of vegetation. They started into it, Chesna leading the way, and about forty seconds later the Mercedes exploded, raining pieces of metal and glass through the trees. Michael smelled blood. He looked at his hands and found a thick smear of red on the fingers of his right hand. and then he looked back over his shoulder, and saw that Mouse had fallen to his knees.\n Blok\u0027s shot, Michael realized. Just below Mouse\u0027s heart, the shirt was soaked with crimson. Mouse\u0027s face was pallid, and glistened with sweat.\n Michael knelt beside him. \"Can you stand upi\" He heard his voice quaver.\n Mouse made a gasping noise, his eyes damp. \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll try.\" He did, and got all the way up before his knees caved in. Michael caught him before he fell, and supported him.\n \"What\u0027s wrongi\" Chesna had stopped and come back to them. \"Is he-\" She silenced, because she saw the blood on the little man\u0027s shirt.\n \"They\u0027re coming!\" Wilhelm said. \"They\u0027re right behind us!\" He held the submachine gun at hip level and clicked off the safety as his gaze scanned the woods. They could hear the voices of the soldiers, getting closer.\n \"Oh no.\" Mouse blinked. \"Oh no, I\u0027ve messed myself up. Some valet I turned out to be, huhi\"\n \"We\u0027ll have to leave him!\" Wilhelm said. \"Come on!\"\n \"I\u0027m not leaving my friend.\"\n \"Don\u0027t be a fool!\" Wilhelm looked at Chesna. \"I\u0027m going, whether he comes along or not.\" He turned and sprinted into the forest, away from the advancing soldiers.\n Chesna peered up the incline. She could see four or five soldiers coming down through the brush. \"Whatever you\u0027re going to do,\" she told Michael, \"you\u0027d better do it fast.\"\n He did. He picked Mouse up across his shoulders in a fireman\u0027s carry, and he and Chesna hurried into the shadows of the trees. \"This way! Over here!\" they heard one of the soldiers shouting to his companions. a burst of submachine gun fire came from ahead, followed by a number of rifle shots. There was a shout: \"We\u0027ve got one of them!\"\n Chesna crouched against a tree trunk, and Michael stood behind her. She pointed, but Michael\u0027s eyes had already seen: in a clearing just ahead, two soldiers with rifles stood over Wilhelm\u0027s writhing body. Chesna lifted her pistol, took careful aim, and squeezed the trigger. Her target staggered back, a hole at his heart, and fell. The second soldier fired wildly into the trees and started to run for cover. Chesna, her face grim, shot the man in the hip and crippled him. as he fell, her next bullet went through his throat. Then she was on her feet, a professional killer in a sleek black dress, and she ran to Wilhelm\u0027s side. Michael followed, quickly making the same judgment as Chesna: Wilhelm had been shot in the stomach and the chest, and there was no hope for him. The man moaned and writhed, his eyes squeezed shut with agony.\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Chesna whispered, and she placed the Luger\u0027s barrel against Wilhelm\u0027s skull, shielded her face with her other hand, and delivered the mercy bullet.\n She picked up the submachine gun and pushed the Luger down into Michael\u0027s waistband. Its heat scorched his belly. Chesna\u0027s tawny eyes were wet and rimmed with red, but her face was calm and composed. One of her black high heels had broken, and she kicked the shoe off and threw its partner into the woods. \"Let\u0027s go,\" she said tersely, and started off. Michael, with Mouse across his shoulders, kept pace with her though his thigh wound had opened again. His exhaustion was held at bay only by the realization of what would happen to them once they fell into the Gestapo\u0027s embrace. any hope of finding the meaning of Iron Fist and communicating that secret to the allies would be lost.\n There was a movement on the left: the glint of sunlight on a belt buckle. Chesna whirled and sprayed a burst of fire at the soldier, who dropped to his belly in the leaves. \"Over here!\" the soldier shouted, and fired two bullets that thunked into the trees as Chesna and Michael changed direction and ran. Something came flying through the woods at them, hit a tree trunk at their backs, and bounced off. Three seconds later there was a ringing blast that knifed their eardrums, the concussion sending leaves flying. Dense white smoke billowed up. a smoke grenade, Michael realized, marking their position for the other soldiers. Chesna kept going, shielding her face as they tore through a tangle of thorns. Michael heard shouts from behind them, on their left and right. a bullet whizzed past his head like an enraged hornet. Chesna, her face streaked with thorn slashes, stopped in her tracks in underbrush near the edge of the road. Two more trucks had pulled off, and were disgorging their cargo of soldiers. Chesna motioned for Michael to back up, then she guided him in another direction. They struggled up a hillside through dense green foliage, then down again into a ravine.\n Three soldiers appeared at the top, silhouetted against the sun. Chesna fired her weapon, knocked two of the men down, and the third fled. another smoke grenade exploded on their right, the acrid white smoke flooding across the ravine. The hounds were closing in, Michael thought. He could sense them running from shadow to shadow, salivating as their gun sights trained in. Chesna ran along the bottom of the ravine, bruising her feet on stones but neither pausing nor registering pain. Michael was right behind her, the smoke swirling around them. Mouse was still breathing, but the back of Michael\u0027s neck was damp with blood. The hollow crump of a third smoke grenade went off amid the trees to their left. above the forest, dark banners of crows circled and screamed.\n Figures were darting down the hillside and into the smoke. Chesna caught sight of them, and her quick spray of bullets drove them back. a rifle slug ricocheted off an edge of rock beside her, and stone splinters jabbed her arm. She looked around, her face glistening with sweat and her eyes wild; Michael saw in them the fear of a trapped animal. She ran on, crouched low, and he followed on cramping legs.\n The ravine ended, and yielded to forest once more. amid the trees a stream snaked between mossy banks. a bend of the road lay ahead, and beneath it was a stone culvert through which the steam rushed, its opening all but clogged by mud and vegetation. Michael glanced back and saw soldiers emerging from the smoky ravine. Other figures were coming down the hillside, taking cover behind the trees. Chesna was already on her knees, starting to push herself into the muddy culvert. \"Come on!\" she urged him. \"Hurry!\"\n It was a tight squeeze. and, looking at it, Michael knew he could never get himself and Mouse through there before the soldiers reached them. His decision was made in an instant; as Chesna lay on her stomach and winnowed into the culvert, Michael turned away and ran out of the stream bed into the woods. Chesna kept going, through the slime, and the mud and underbrush closed behind her.\n a rifle bullet sliced a pine branch over Michael\u0027s head. He zigzagged between the trees, until a smoke grenade exploded almost in front of him and turned him aside. These hunters, he thought grimly, knew their work. His lungs were laboring, his strength sweating away. He tore through a green thicket, the sunlight lying around him in golden bars. He struggled up a hillside and down again-and then his feet slipped on a carpet of dead brown leaves and he and Mouse slid into a tangled nightmare of blue-black thorns that snagged their clothes and flesh.\n Michael thrashed to get loose. He saw soldiers coming, from all sides. He looked at Mouse, and saw blood creeping from the little man\u0027s mouth.\n \"Please... please,\" Mouse was gasping. \"Please... don\u0027t let them torture me...\"\n Michael got his hands free and pulled the Luger from his waistband. He shot the first soldier he aimed at, and the others hit the ground. His next two shots went wild through the trees but the fourth clanged off a Nazi helmet. Michael took aim at a white face and squeezed the trigger. Nothing happened; the Luger\u0027s magazine was empty.\n Submachine-gun fire kicked through the thorns, showering Michael and Mouse with dirt. a voice shouted, \"Don\u0027t kill them, you idiots!\" It was Jerek Blok, crouched somewhere up on the hillside. Then: \"Throw out your gun, Baron! We\u0027re all around you! One word from me and you\u0027ll be cut to pieces!\"\n Michael felt dazed, his body on the verge of collapse. He looked again at Mouse, and damned himself for pulling his friend into this deadly vortex. Mouse\u0027s eyes were pleading, and Michael recognized the eyes of Nikita, as the injured wolf lay on the railroad tracks a long, long time ago.\n \"I\u0027m waiting, Baron!\" Blok called.\n \"Don\u0027t... let them torture me,\" Mouse whispered. \"I couldn\u0027t stand it. I\u0027d tell them everything, and I... wouldn\u0027t be able to help it.\" His thorn-scarred hand clutched at Michael\u0027s arm, and a faint smile played across his mouth. \"You know... I just realized... you never told me your real name.\"\n \"It\u0027s Michael.\"\n \"Michael,\" Mouse repeated. \"Like the angel, huhi\"\n Perhaps a dark angel, Michael thought. an angel to whom killing was second nature. It occurred to him, quite suddenly, that a werewolf never died of old age; and neither would the man Michael had known as Mouse.\n \"Baron! Five seconds and we start shooting!\"\n The Gestapo would find a way to keep Mouse alive, Michael knew. They\u0027d pump him full of drugs, and then they\u0027d torture him to death. It would be an ugly way to die. Michael knew the same fate awaited him; but he was no stranger to pain, and if there was one chance that he might be able to get away and continue his mission, he had to take it.\n So be it. Michael tossed the Luger out, and it clattered to the ground.\n He put his hands to the sides of Mouse\u0027s head and took the little man\u0027s weight on top of him. Tears sprang to his eyes, burning trails down his thorn-scratched cheeks. an angel, he thought bitterly. Oh yes. a damned angel.\n \"Will you... take care of mei\" Mouse asked softly, beginning to fall into delirium.\n \"Yes,\" Michael answered. \"I will.\"\n a moment later Blok\u0027s voice again: \"Crawl out into the open! Both of you!\"\n One figure emerged from the thorns. Dusty, bleeding, and exhausted, Michael lay on his hands and knees as six soldiers with rifles and submachine guns circled him. Blok came striding up, with Boots following. \"Where\u0027s the other onei\" He looked into the thorns, could see the motionless body lying in the coils. \"Get him out!\" he told two of the soldiers, and they waded into the tangle. \"On your feet,\" Blok said to Michael. \"Baron, did you hear mei\"\n Michael slowly stood up, and stared defiantly into Jerek Blok\u0027s eyes.\n \"Where did the bitch goi\" the colonel asked.\n Michael didn\u0027t answer. He flinched, listening to the sound of Mouse\u0027s clothes ripping on the thorns as the soldiers dragged him out.\n \"Where did the bitch goi\" Blok placed the barrel of his Luger underneath Michael\u0027s left eye.\n \"Stop the bullshit,\" Michael replied, speaking in Russian. He saw the blood drain out of Blok\u0027s face. \"You won\u0027t kill me.\"\n \"What did he sayi\" The colonel looked around for an interpreter. \"That was Russian, wasn\u0027t iti What did he sayi\"\n \"I said,\" Michael continued in his native tongue, \"that you suck donkey cocks and whistle out your ass.\"\n \"What the hell did he sayi\" Blok demanded. He glared at Boots. \"You spent time on the Russian Front! What did he sayi\"\n \"I... uh... think he said... that he owns a donkey and a rooster that sings.\"\n \"Is he trying to be funny, or is he insanei\"\n Michael released a guttural bark, and Blok stepped back two paces. and then Michael looked to his side, at Mouse\u0027s corpse. One of the soldiers was trying to get Mouse\u0027s closed right fist open. The fingers wouldn\u0027t give. Suddenly Boots strode forward, lifted a foot, and smashed it down on the hand. Bones cracked like matchsticks, and Michael stood in shock as Boots crunched his weight down on the hand. When the huge man raised his foot again, the fingers were splayed and broken. There in the palm was a Cross of Iron.\n Boots leaned over, started to reach for the medal.\n Michael said, in German, \"If you touch that, I\u0027ll kill you.\"\n The man\u0027s voice-sure and steady-made Boots pause. He blinked uncertainly, his hand outstretched to grasp a dead man\u0027s last possession. Michael stared at him, smelling the heat of wildness burning in his veins. He was close to the change... very, very close. If he wanted it, it was right there within easy reach...\n Blok\u0027s pistol, held at the colonel\u0027s side, came up in a savage arc and thudded into Michael\u0027s testicles. Michael gasped in agony and dropped to his knees.\n \"Now, now, Baron,\" Blok chided. \"Threats are beneath royalty, don\u0027t you agreei\" He nodded at Boots, who plucked up the Iron Cross into his own fist. \"Baron, we\u0027re going to get to know each other very well indeed. You may learn to sing in a higher register before I\u0027m done with you. Haul him up, please,\" he told two soldiers, and the men pulled Michael to his feet. Pain throbbed in Michael\u0027s groin, doubling him over; even as a wolf, he wouldn\u0027t get very far before he crumpled into an exhausted heap. Now was not the time, or the place. He let the wild call drift away from him, like a fading echo.\n \"Come on, we\u0027ve got a distance to travel.\" Blok walked up the hillside, and the soldiers shoved Michael ahead of them. Other soldiers walked on either side of him, their guns ready. Boots followed at a distance, the Iron Cross in his hand, and a few more soldiers began to drag Mouse\u0027s body up toward the road. Michael did not look at Mouse again; the little man was gone, and he would not have to face the torture that awaited.\n Blok looked up at the blue sky, and his silver teeth gleamed brightly as he smiled. \"ah, it\u0027s a beautiful day, isn\u0027t iti\" he said, to no one in particular. He would leave a detachment of troops to continue searching for her, and he had no doubt that the bitch would be found soon. She couldn\u0027t have gotten very far. after all, she was only a woman. His heart was hurting for being such a fool, but he looked forward to having Chesna in his hands. He had considered himself her agreeable uncle when he\u0027d thought she was a loyal Nazi; now, however, a traitor of Chesna\u0027s magnitude merited treatment that was less familial and more familiar. But what a scandal! This must be kept from the newspapers, at all costs! and, also, from the prying eyes and ears of Himmler. So, a question: where to take the baron for interrogationi\n ah, yes! Blok thought. Of course!\n He watched as the baron was shoved into the rear of a truck and made to lie down on his back with his hands pinned under him. a soldier sat next to him, with a rifle barrel pressed against his throat.\n Blok walked over to confer with the truck driver as other soldiers continued their search in the forest for Germany\u0027s Golden Girl. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-wolf-s-hour-michael-gallatin-1/page-54.html","bookId":2469,"book":{"id":2469,"title":"The Wolf\u0027s Hour (Michael Gallatin #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Wolf\u0027s Hour (Michael Gallatin #1) \n This book is a remarkable tale of pulse-pounding excitement with a uniquely sympathetic, fascinating portrait of the werewolf as noble warrior-and conflicted being.
