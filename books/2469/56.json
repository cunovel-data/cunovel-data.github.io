Don\u0027t answer! he thought. If you don\u0027t answer, whoever\u0027s speaking will go away and let you rest! a light switched on. The light was very bright; Michael could see it through his eyelids. \"He\u0027s awake,\" he heard the voice say to someone else in the room. \"You see how his pulse has increasedi Oh, he knows we\u0027re here, all right.\" It was Blok\u0027s voice, he realized. a hand grasped his chin and shook his face. \"Come on, come on. Open your eyes, Baron.\" He wouldn\u0027t. \"Give him a drink of water,\" Blok said, and immediately a bucket of cold water was flung into Michael\u0027s face. He sputtered, his body involuntarily shivering with the chill, and his eyes opened. The light-a spot lamp of brutal wattage, drawn up close to his face-made him squeeze his eyelids shut again. \"Baroni\" Blok said. \"If you refuse to open your eyes, we\u0027ll cut your eyelids off.\" There was no doubt they would. He obeyed, squinting in the glare. \"Good! Now we can get some business done!\" Blok pulled up a chair on casters beside the prisoner and sat down. Michael could make out others in the room: a tall man holding a dripping bucket, another figure-this one thick and fleshy-in a black SS uniform that bulged at the seams. Major Krolle, of course. \"Before we begin,\" Blok said quietly, \"I\u0027ll tell you that you are a man whom hope has abandoned. There is no escape from this room. Beyond these walls, there are more walls.\" He leaned forward, into the light, and his silver teeth glittered. \"You have no friends here, and no one is coming to save you. We are going to destroy you-either quickly, or slowly: that is the sole choice within your power to make. Do you understandi Nod, please.\" Michael was busy trying to figure out how he was bound. He was lying, stark naked, on a metal table that was shaped like an X, his arms outstretched over his head and his legs apart. Tight leather straps secured his wrists and ankles. The table was tilted up and forward, so that Michael was very close to an upright position. He tested the straps; they wouldn\u0027t give even a quarter of an inch. \"Baumani\" Blok said. \"Bring me some more water, please.\" The man with the bucket-an aide to Major Krolle, Michael assumed-answered \"Yes sir\" and walked across the room. an iron bolt slid back, and there was a quick glimpse of gray light as a heavy door opened and closed. Blok turned his attention to the prisoner again. \"What is your name and nationalityi\" Michael was silent. His heart pounded; he was sure Blok could see it. His shoulder hurt like hell, though it probably wasn\u0027t fractured. He felt like a wrapping of bruises around a barbed-wire skeleton. Blok expected an answer, and Michael decided to give him one: \"Richard Hamlet. I\u0027m British.\" \"Oh, you\u0027re British, are youi a Tommy who speaks perfect Russiani I don\u0027t think so. If you\u0027re so very British, say something in English for me.\" He didn\u0027t respond. Blok sighed deeply, and shook his head. \"I think I prefer you as a baron. all right, let\u0027s say for the sake of speculation that you\u0027re art agent for the Red army. Probably dropped into Germany on an assassination or sabotage mission. Your contact was Chesna van Dorne. How and where did you meet heri\" Had they caught Chesnai Michael wondered. There was no answer to that question in the eyes of his inquisitor. \"What was your missioni\" Blok asked. Michael stared straight ahead, a pulse beating at his temple. \"Why did Chesna bring you to the Reichkroneni\" Still no response. \"How were you planning on getting out of the country after your mission was completedi\" No answer. Blok leaned a little closer. \"Have you ever heard of a man named Theo von Frankewitzi\" Michael kept his face emotionless. \"Von Frankewitz seemed to know you,\" Blok continued. \"Oh, he tried to shield you at first, but we gave him some interesting drugs. Before he died, he told us the exact description of a man who visited him at his apartment. He told us he showed this man a drawing. The man he described is you, Baron. Now tell me, please: what interest would a Russian secret agent have in a decrepit sidewalk artist like Frankewitzi\" He prodded Michael\u0027s bruised shoulder with his forefinger. \"Don\u0027t think you\u0027re being brave, Baron. You\u0027re being very stupid. We can shoot you full of drugs to loosen your tongue, but unfortunately those don\u0027t work very well unless you\u0027re in... shall we say... a weakened condition. Therefore we must satisfy that requirement. It\u0027s your choice, Baron: how shall we do thisi\" Michael didn\u0027t answer. He knew what was ahead, and he was readying himself for it. \"I see,\" Blok said. He stood up, and moved away from the prisoner. \"Major Krollei at your pleasure, please.\" Krolle stalked forward, lifted the rubber baton, and went to work. Sometime later, cold water was thrown into Michael\u0027s face again and revived him to the devil\u0027s kingdom. He coughed and sputtered, his nostrils clogged with blood. His right eye was swollen shut, and the entire right side of his face felt weighted with bruises. His lower lip was gashed open, leaking a thread of crimson that trickled down his chin to his chest. \"This really is pointless, Baron.\" Colonel Blok was sitting in his chair again, next to Michael. On a tray in front of him was a plate of sausages and sauerkraut and a crystal goblet of white wine. Blok had a napkin tucked in his collar and was eating his dinner with a silver knife and fork. \"You know I can kill you anytime I please.\" Michael snorted blood from his nostrils. His nose might be broken. His tongue found a loose molar. \"Major Krolle wants to kill you now and be done with it,\" Blok went on. He chewed a bite of sausage and dabbed his lips with the napkin. \"I think you\u0027ll come to your senses before very much longer. Where are you from, Baroni Moscowi Leningradi What military districti\" \"I\u0027m...\" His voice was a hoarse croak. He tried again. \"I\u0027m a British citizen.\" \"Oh, don\u0027t start that again!\" Blok cautioned. He took a sip of wine. \"Baron, who directed you to Theo von Frankewitzi Was it Chesnai\" Michael didn\u0027t answer. His vision blurred in and out, his brains rattling from the beating. \"This is what I believe,\" the colonel said. \"That Chesna was in the business of selling German military secrets. I don\u0027t know how she learned about Frankewitz, but let\u0027s speculate that she is involved in a network of traitors. She was helping you with your mission-whatever that was-and she decided to intrigue you with some information that she thought you might take back to your Russian masters. Dogs do have masters, don\u0027t theyi Well, perhaps Chesna thought you might pay for this information. Did youi\" No response. Michael stared past the blinding spot lamp. \"Chesna brought you to the Reichkronen to assassinate someone, didn\u0027t shei\" Blok cut a sausage open, and grease drooled out. \"all those officers there... possibly you were going to blow the entire place to pieces. But tell me: why did you go into Sandler\u0027s suitei You did kill his hawk, didn\u0027t youi\" When Michael didn\u0027t answer, Blok smiled thinly. \"No harm done. I despised that damned bird. But when I found all those feathers and that mess in Sandler\u0027s suite, I knew it had to be your doing-especially after that little drama on the riverbank. I knew you must have had commando training, to have gotten off Sandler\u0027s train. He\u0027s hunted over a dozen men on that train, and some of them were ex-officers who\u0027d fallen from grace; so you see, I knew no tulip-growing \u0027baron\u0027 could have beaten Sandler. But he gave you a run, didn\u0027t hei\" He poked his knife at the blood-crusted bullet gash on Michael\u0027s thigh. \"Now, about Frankewitz: who else knows about the drawing he showed youi\" \"You\u0027ll have to ask Chesna,\" Michael said, probing to see if she\u0027d been captured. \"Yes, I will. Count on it. But for right now, I\u0027m asking you. Who else knows about that drawingi\" They didn\u0027t have her, Michael thought. Or maybe it was just a faint hope. The security of that drawing was paramount to Blok. Blok finished his sausage and drank his wine, waiting for the Russian secret agent to answer. Finally he stood up and pushed his chair back. \"Major Krollei\" he said, and motioned the man forward. Krolle came out of the darkness. The rubber baton was upraised, and Michael\u0027s bruised muscles tensed. He wasn\u0027t ready for another beating yet; he had to stall for time. He said, \"I know all about Iron Fist.\" The baton started to fall, aimed at Michael\u0027s face. Before it could smash down, a hand grasped Krolle\u0027s wrist and checked its descent. \"One moment,\" Blok told him. The colonel stared fixedly at Michael. \"a phrase,\" he said. \"Two words you got out of Frankewitz. They meant nothing to him, and they mean nothing to you.\" It was time for a shot in the dark. \"The allies might think differently.\" There was a silence in the room, as if mere mention of the allies had the power to freeze flesh and blood. Blok continued to stare at Michael, his face betraying no emotion. and then Blok spoke: \"Major Krolle, would you leave the room, pleasei Bauman, you, too.\" He waited until the major and his aide had left, then began to walk back and forth across the stone floor, his hands behind him and his body crooked slightly forward. He suddenly stopped. \"You\u0027re bluffing. You don\u0027t know a damned thing about Iron Fist.\" \"I know you\u0027re in charge of security for the project,\" Michael said, choosing his words carefully. \"I presume you didn\u0027t take me to Gestapo headquarters in Berlin because you don\u0027t want your superiors to find out there\u0027s been a security leak.\" \"There has been no leak. Besides, I don\u0027t know what project you\u0027re talking about.\" \"Oh yes, you do. I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s no secret any longer.\" Blok approached Michael and leaned over him. \"Reallyi Then tell me, Baron: what is Iron Fisti\" His breath smelled of sausage and sauerkraut. The moment of truth had arrived. Michael knew very well that one sentence might spell judgment for him. He said, \"Dr. Hildebrand\u0027s created something quite a bit more potent than delousing spray, hasn\u0027t hei\" a muscle clenched in Blok\u0027s bony jaw. Other than that, the man didn\u0027t move. \"Yes, I did get into Sandler\u0027s suite,\" Michael went on. \"But before I did, I got into yours. I found your satchel, and those photographs of Hildebrand\u0027s test subjects. Prisoners of war, I suspect. Where are you shipping them fromi Herei Other campsi\" Blok\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"Let\u0027s speculate, shall wei\" Michael asked. \"You\u0027re shipping POWs from a number of camps. They go to Hildebrand\u0027s workshop on Skarpa Island.\" Blok\u0027s face had turned a shade gray. \"Oh... I think I\u0027d like a sip of wine, please,\" he said. \"To wet my throat.\" \"I\u0027ll cut your throat, you Slav son of a bitch!\" Blok hissed. \"I don\u0027t think so. a sip of wine, pleasei\" Blok remained motionless. Finally a cold smile crept across his mouth. \"as you wish, Baron.\" He took the goblet of white wine from the tray and held it to Michael\u0027s mouth, allowing him one swallow before he drew it away. \"Go on with this fanciful conjecture.\" Michael licked his swollen lower lip, the wine stinging it. \"The prisoners are subjected to Hildebrand\u0027s tests. Over three hundred of them so far, as I recall. I assume you speak regularly with Hildebrand. You were probably using those pictures to show your superiors how the project\u0027s coming along. am I correcti\" \"You know, this room is very strange.\" Blok looked around. \"You can hear the dead talking in it.\" \"You might want to kill me, but you won\u0027t. You and I both know how important Iron Fist is.\" another shot in the dark that hit its target; Blok stared at him again. \"My friends in Moscow would be thrilled to pass that information along to the allies.\" What Michael was hinting at took root. Blok said, \"and who else knows about thisi\" His voice was reedy, and there might have been a quaver in it. \"Chesna\u0027s not the only one.\" He decided to lead Blok by the pinched nostrils. \"She was with you while I was in your suite.\" That sank in. Blok\u0027s expression was stricken for a second as he realized that someone on the Reichkronen staff must be a traitor. \"Who gave you the keyi\" \"I never knew. The key was delivered to Chesna\u0027s suite during the Brimstone Club\u0027s meeting. I returned it by dropping it into a flower pot on the second floor.\" So far, so good, he thought. It would never occur to Blok that Michael had descended the castle wall. He cocked his head to one side. His heart was beating hard, and he knew he was playing a dangerous charade but he had to buy time. \"You know, I think you\u0027re right about this room. You can hear the voice of a dead colonel.\" \"Mock me if you wish, Baron.\" Blok smiled tightly, whorls of red in his cheeks. \"But a few injections of truth serum and you\u0027ll tell me everything.\" \"I think you\u0027ll find I\u0027m a little tougher than Frankewitz was. Besides, I can\u0027t tell you what I don\u0027t know. The key was delivered, and I returned it in an envelope along with the film.\" \"Filmi What filmi\" The quaver was more pronounced. \"Well, I wouldn\u0027t have gone into your suite unprepared, would Ii Of course I had a camera. also furnished by Chesna\u0027s friend. I took pictures of the photographs in your satchel. Plus those other papers, the ones that looked like pages from an accounting book.\" Blok was silent, but Michael could tell what he must be thinking: that secrets under his responsibility were out, possibly headed by courier to the Soviet Union, and the Reichkronen was a nest of traitors. \"You\u0027re a liar,\" Blok said. \"If these things were true, you wouldn\u0027t be volunteering them so freely.\" \"I don\u0027t want to die. Neither do I care to be tortured. anyway, the information\u0027s already been passed. There isn\u0027t anything you can do about it now.\" \"Oh, I disagree. Very strongly.\" Blok reached onto his tray, and his hand gripped the fork. He stood beside Michael, his face blotched with red. \"I\u0027ll tear the Reichkronen to the ground and execute everyone from the plumbers to the manager, if that\u0027s what is necessary. You, my dear Baron, will tell me all about how and where you met Chesna, what your escape route was going to be, and so much more. and you\u0027re right: I won\u0027t kill you.\" He jabbed the fork\u0027s tines into the flesh of Michael\u0027s left arm and drew it out. \"You do have a certain value, after all.\" again the fork jabbed down, piercing Michael\u0027s shoulder. Michael flinched, sweat on his face. The fork was withdrawn. \"I\u0027m going to consume you,\" Blok said, and drove the tines into Michael\u0027s chest just below the throat, \"like a piece of meat. I\u0027ll chew you up, digest what I need, and spit out the rest.\" He pulled the fork out, the tines tipped with blood. \"You might know about Iron Fist-and about Dr. Hildebrand and Skarpa Island-but you don\u0027t know how Iron Fist is going to be used. No one knows where the fortress is but myself, Dr. Hildebrand, and a few others whose loyalty is unquestioned. Therefore, your Russian friends don\u0027t know either, and they can\u0027t pass the information to the British and americans, can theyi\" He jabbed the fork into Michael\u0027s left cheek, then he drew it out and tasted Michael\u0027s blood. \"This,\" Blok said, \"is only the first course.\" He snapped off the spot lamp. Michael heard him cross the room. The heavy door opened. \"Bauman,\" the colonel said, \"take this trash to a cell.\" He had been holding his breath; now he let it go in a hiss between his teeth. For the time being, at least, there would be no more torture. Bauman entered, along with three other soldiers. Michael\u0027s wrists and ankles were unstrapped, and he was pulled up off the X-shaped table and guided by gunpoint along a stone-floored corridor. \"Go on, you swine!\" Bauman-a slim young man with round-lensed spectacles and a long, gaunt face-growled as he shoved Michael forward. On either side of the hallway were three-foot-high wooden doors with iron latches, set at floor level. In the doors were small square insets that could be slid back for, Michael assumed, either air or the passing in of food and water. The place smelled damp and ancient, with suggestions of sodden hay, human excrement, sweat, and unwashed flesh. a kennel for wild dogs, Michael thought. He heard the animalish moans and mutterings of his fellow prisoners. \"Stop,\" Bauman commanded. He held himself stiff-backed and looked at Michael with disinterest. \"Get on your knees.\" Michael hesitated. Two rifles jabbed his back. He bent down, and one of the soldiers drew the iron bolt back with a rusty shriek. Something scurried beyond the door. Bauman opened it. a hot, sickening wave of stale air rolled out into Michael\u0027s face. In the kennel\u0027s rank darkness he could make out five or six skinny human bodies, perhaps others crouched up against the walls. The floor was covered with filthy hay, and the ceiling was only five feet off the floor. \"Go in,\" Bauman said. \"Mercy of God! Mercy of God!\" an emaciated, bald-headed man with bulging eyes cried out, and lurched toward the door on his knees, his hands upraised and running sores all over his sunken chest. He stopped, shivering, and looked hopefully at Bauman, his eyes blinking in the gloom. \"I said, go in,\" the Nazi repeated. Two seconds after he\u0027d spoken, one of the soldiers kicked Michael in the ribs with his booted foot, and the others shoved him into the hellish cubicle and slammed the door shut. The iron latch scraped into its socket. \"Mercy of God! Mercy of God!\" the prisoner kept shouting, until a gruff voice from the rear of the cell silenced him by saying, \"Shut up, Metzger! No one\u0027s listening to you!\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-wolf-s-hour-michael-gallatin-1/page-56.html","bookId":2469,"book":{"id":2469,"title":"The Wolf\u0027s Hour (Michael Gallatin #1)","description":"Storyline: The Wolf\u0027s Hour (Michael Gallatin #1) This book is a remarkable tale of pulse-pounding excitement with a uniquely sympathetic, fascinating portrait of the werewolf as noble warrior-and conflicted being.
