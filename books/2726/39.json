{"id":79565,"no":39,"title":"Page 39","content":"“Not anymore. Ash is going with Derek, PJ’s taking that cute sophomore girl Allie. And I’m going with Reeve.”\n “You asked him already?” When did all this happen? When did everyone pair off without telling me?\n “Not yet. I mean, it’s a given that he’ll say yes.” Rennie messes with her strapless bra, trying to create more cle**age. “I’m telling you, Lil. It’s going to be our night. He’ll be looking hot, I’ll be looking hot. You saw what happened during spin the bottle. Fireworks.”\n I feel myself sweating. “Then, who am I going to go with?”\n She hops down from the box and says, “Go with Lindy,” before disappearing back into her dressing room.\n Oh my God. Is she serious? This is just so Rennie, to not even consider the fact that Nadia has hooked up with Alex, which she totally knows and still hasn’t admitted to me! It’s unbelievably insensitive. And there’s no way I’m going to go to homecoming with Alex if there is even a remote possibility that he likes me. Especially not after the things I did to him. That would just be way too awkward.\n “I’m not going with Alex,” I say. “I’ll just ride with you guys in the limo.”\n From the other side of the door, I hear her say, “We’re all going to be paired up. It would be weird if you were alone, just tagging along with no date. Besides, Alex doesn’t have a date yet either. It’s going to look like you guys are going as a couple anyway.”\n I honestly don’t care what it looks like. “I said no,” I say, my voice rising.\n “Fine, whatevs. I was just looking out for you. By all means, do whatever your little heart desires.”\n I go back into the dressing room and force myself to keep trying on the dresses I picked. The last one is maybe cute. It’s black, which I hadn’t considered, but the cut is just what I wanted. Strapless, with a sharp sweetheart neckline, and a short poufy skirt. It’s sophisticated. I come out of the dressing room and ask Rennie what she thinks. “With peachy-nude heels?” I ask.\n Rennie taps her finger against her lips. Considering. It used to be that I would wait for Rennie to decide before I could. Whether or not something was good, I mean.\n “I think I’m going to get it,” I say. I’ll wear my hair up, I decide. I step off the platform and go back into the dressing room.\n I slide the dress off. And then put it back on the hanger. It’s expensive, more expensive than I thought for a plain black dress. I’m standing there, in my underwear, wondering if my mom will kill me, when I see Rennie’s hand waving underneath the wall.\n “Hey, let me try that last dress on.”\n You already found your dress, I want to say. And also you can’t afford it.\n Instead I pass my dress under the door, change back into my clothes, and wait while Rennie tries it on.\n I hate that she looks good in it too. I decide right then and there that I’m definitely buying it.\n “This is cute,” she says, admiring herself. “Which one do you like best on me, Lil?”\n I want to scream. But I don’t. Of course I don’t. Instead I change the subject. “Hey, did you hear that Melanie Renfro is, like, hard-core campaigning for homecoming queen? I saw her talking to the track guys.”\n Rennie rolls her eyes. “I’m not worried about Melanie Renfro. I’m telling you, Lil. I’ve got this in the bag.” She cocks her head to the side, and then nods her head decisively. “The silver one. That’s a homecoming queen’s dress.”\n It hits me. The best way to get back at Rennie.\n * * *\n The whole ferry ride home, I can’t wait to tell Kat that I’ve got the perfect plan for her revenge—we’ll find a way to keep Rennie from winning homecoming queen.\n Once we get back to Jar Island, I’m more than ready for Rennie to drop me off. But instead she drives right past my block. I turn in my seat, and she says, “I’m going to swing by Alex’s place. I want to talk to Reeve about homecoming.”\n “Right now? Can’t you take me home first?”\n “No.” She puts a hand on her heart. “I’ve got this feeling like it needs to happen tonight. It’ll take, like, five minutes.”\n Again. What I want doesn’t matter to her. “I’ll wait in the car.”\n “Just come inside with me. Keep Alex company while I talk to Reeve.”\n We park, and Rennie takes a minute to touch up her lip gloss. Her hand is shaking, she’s that nervous. I follow her into the pool house with my arms folded. I’m sure I don’t look happy, because I’m not. In fact, I’m hoping Reeve shoots her down.\n Reeve and Alex are on the couch, playing video games. I guess what happened on the field is already old news. It’s funny. I don’t think boys even know how to hold a grudge. I’m sure Reeve denied he had anything to do with the jerseys or the song and Alex took his word for it. Hopefully, Alex won’t go looking for the person who did.\n I stay near the door while Rennie walks up and stands right in front of the television. “Reevie,” she says sweetly. “Can I talk to you for a second, in private?”\n Reeve tries to look past Rennie at the screen, and when he can’t, he pauses the game. “Of course.”\n Rennie slides her arm through his and leads him off into Alex’s bedroom. “BRB, Lillia!”\n Alex turns around and sees me. “Hey, Lillia.”\n “Hey, Lindy.” I sit down on the far end of the sectional. Alex’s face is barely red anymore. I guess he finally stopped using that lotion. “Your skin looks a lot better.”\n Alex turns so he’s facing me. “Rennie’s asking Reeve to homecoming, huh?”\n Surprised, I say, “How did you know?”\n “Well, because Ashlin asked Derek today. And I think PJ’s gonna bring some sophomore girl.” I notice that Alex is blushing. It’s coming up from his chest, creeping up his neck. “No one’s asked you yet, right?”\n Oh, no. Oh, no. Rennie’s probably already told Alex to ask me! I quickly get up from the couch and walk over to the window. “God, I don’t understand why we can’t just go in a big group the way we always do. Why change things now? It’s so dumb. I mean, we’ll be hanging out together anyway.”\n Alex comes over near to where I’m standing. Not too close, but close enough. He nods, like I’ve made a good point. “Yeah. I guess you’re right.” But I can tell he’s disappointed. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/burn-for-burn-burn-for-burn-1/page-39.html","bookId":2726,"book":{"id":2726,"title":"Burn for Burn (Burn for Burn #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Postcard-perfect Jar Island is home to charming tourist shops, pristine beaches, amazing oceanfront homes—and three girls secretly plotting revenge. \n KAT is sick and tired of being bullied by her former best friend. \n LILLIA has always looked out for her little sister, so when she discovers that one of her guy friends has been secretly hooking up with her, she’s going to put a stop to it. \n MARY is perpetually haunted by a traumatic event from years past, and the boy who’s responsible has yet to get what’s coming to him. \n None of the girls can act on their revenge fantasies alone without being suspected.
