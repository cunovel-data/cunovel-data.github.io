{"id":100874,"no":51,"title":"Page 51","content":"“What’s this?” I thought we were buying a pill.\\n\\n “Liquid ecstasy. It’s a lot stronger than the regular kind.”\\n\\n I unscrew the top. The liquid inside the vial is clear. I hold it under my nose and sniff, but it doesn’t smell like anything. “Are you sure this guy didn’t rip you off?”\\n\\n Kat glares at me. “What do you take me for? I know drugs, Lillia. A couple of drops in Reeve’s drink, and he’ll be tripping balls. It should only take about fifteen minutes to kick in, so wait until Reeve gets to the dance before you do it. If he starts wigging out before you get there, one of your friends might lock him in the limo until he sobers up.”\\n\\n “How long will it last?”\\n\\n “Reeve will be riding pink elephants for at least eight hours.” Kat snorts. “Mary, as soon Reeve starts to get crazy, find one of your teachers and point Reeve out. I’ll do the same thing. Then they’ll already be watching when he peaks.”\\n\\n “Senor Tremont is one of the chaperones,” Mary says. “We did this whole thing in class today about Spanish dancing.”\\n\\n “Perfect,” I say. “I think he almost failed Reeve in Spanish II last year because he wrote his final paper on the Three Amigos movie. Tremont hates him.” I turn the vial over in my hands. “Um, I need to tell you guys something.”\\n\\n “What? Are you okay, Lillia?” Mary asks. “Please don’t worry. Everything is going to be okay.”\\n\\n “It’s not that,” I say, and then bite down on my lip. I know I don’t have to tell them about Alex. It’s not like it makes any difference at this point. But I want to be honest with them. Like Mary said, there can’t be any secrets between us. They have a right to know. “I talked to Alex. And it looks like everything with my sister was a big misunderstanding.”\\n\\n Mary’s eyes get big. “Wait. Seriously?”\\n\\n “But I saw them in his car,” Kat says.\\n\\n “Fine, but did you see him kissing my sister? Like, actually see them doing anything?”\\n\\n Kat sucks in a breath. “No. I guess not.”\\n\\n “Alex swears they never hooked up, and I believe him. Maybe it’s stupid, but I do.” I lower my eyes. “I’m really sorry.”\\n\\n Kat waves off my apology. “We can’t dwell on the past. Now it’s our time, mine and Mary’s.”\\n\\n Mary adds, “And it’s not like anything that bad happened to Alex. It was only a couple stupid jokes.” She turns to me. “You’re still in, right, Lillia?”\\n\\n I squeeze the vial of liquid ecstasy tight in my hand. It’s true. We really only screwed with Alex a bit. It was nothing like what we’ve got planned for Reeve and Rennie. There’s no doubt in my mind that those two deserve everything that’s coming to them. “Definitely.”\\n\\n “All right, beotches,” Kat says, running her hands through her hair. “I guess this is it. The grand finale.” She turns to Mary. “You ready?”\\n\\n Mary nods. “I can’t wait.”\\n\\n She doesn’t seem scared at all. Just excited. Same for Kat. I’m still scared, but I’m excited, too.\\n\\n I feel closer to Kat and Mary than to any of my other friends. The three of us, we are a circle. We’re bound to each other now. I can feel it. I feel power, too. All the talking, the hard work, the pranks we’ve pulled, have brought us to right here, right now.\\n\\n I open the front door, and Mary bounds happily down the steps. She goes and gets her bike from underneath one of the bushes.\\n\\n Kat lingers for a second. “One thing,” she says to me. “When you put the E in Reeve’s drink . . . get it done as quickly as you can and don’t make a big deal about it. Hand him a drink and go dance.”\\n\\n I nod. “Okay.”\\n\\n Kat’s face suddenly changes. Her mouth gets tight, and I see her looking over my shoulder. I turn around, and there’s Nadia, in her nightshirt, holding a glass of water.\\n\\n “What are you doing up?” I put my hands behind my back and turn to Kat, hoping she’ll have some kind of excuse. But she’s already gone. I look back at Nadia, my heart thudding in my chest.\\n\\n “What was Kat DeBrassio doing here?” Nadia asks me, confused. She sticks her head out the door and looks down the driveway.\\n\\n “She . . . she was hooking up with Alex this summer,” I say, squeezing the vial in the palm of my hand. “And she heard some weird rumor about you two having a sleepover one night. She came here to threaten you.”\\n\\n Nadia’s face turns pale. “But we never—”\\n\\n “I know. Don’t worry. I set her straight. I told her you would never do that. I just hope she believed me.”\\n\\n Nadia shuffles back from the open door. “Lillia! What should I do?”\\n\\n I close it fast, for drama. “Don’t say a word to anyone about her being here. Don’t give her a reason to come looking for you. I can protect you at school and at home, but I’m not with you 24/7. So just steer clear of her.” I give her a stern look. “’Kay?”\\n\\n She nods. In a small voice she says, “Thanks for sticking up for me.”\\n\\n “You’re my sister,” I say, averting my eyes. “Of course I’m going to stick up for you.”\\n\\n Impulsively Nadia runs up to me and gives me a tight hug and then scampers up the stairs. I lock the front door and let out a sigh of relief. Then I follow her up.\\n\\n My homecoming dress is hanging on the back of my bedroom door. I set out my shoes and the clutch I’m borrowing from my mom. That’s where I put the vial of liquid ecstasy. In the little satin pocket where a lipstick is supposed to go.\\n\\n Then I turn off my light and climb into bed. I hope it doesn’t take me long to fall asleep. Tomorrow’s a big day.\\n\\n CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE\\n\\n MARY\\n\\n I’VE GOT DRESSES AND DRESSES PILED UP ON MY BED. Every single one I brought with me to Jar Island. I’ve tried on six, but none of them are right for tonight. I put on number seven, a lacy white dress with a crinoline skirt, but it looks babyish, like an oversize christening gown. I want to look beautiful tonight. Beautiful enough to have been homecoming queen myself, if I wasn’t the new girl, if I’d never had to move away.\\n\\n As I sort through the pile, I wonder if maybe Aunt Bette has something I could borrow, or if it’s not too late to go to that fancy boutique on Third Street in White Haven. The dresses there cost, like, three hundred dollars, but I’m pretty sure my mom would agree that it’s worth the expense. Looking good, I mean. Not just good. Tonight I have to look perfect. Even though Ashlin is the one who’s going to be crowned homecoming queen, tonight is my night. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/burn-for-burn-burn-for-burn-1/page-51.html","bookId":2726,"book":{"id":2726,"title":"Burn for Burn (Burn for Burn #1)","description":"Storyline: Postcard-perfect Jar Island is home to charming tourist shops, pristine beaches, amazing oceanfront homes—and three girls secretly plotting revenge. \\n KAT is sick and tired of being bullied by her former best friend. \\n LILLIA has always looked out for her little sister, so when she discovers that one of her guy friends has been secretly hooking up with her, she’s going to put a stop to it. \\n MARY is perpetually haunted by a traumatic event from years past, and the boy who’s responsible has yet to get what’s coming to him. \\n None of the girls can act on their revenge fantasies alone without being suspected.
