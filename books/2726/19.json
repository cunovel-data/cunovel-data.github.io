{"id":79547,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"“No, thanks,” I say.\\n\\n “Lil, you should wear sunglasses, or else you’ll get crow’s-feet.”\\n\\n I shake my head. I never wear sunglasses. I don’t want to make it feel darker out than it is. I want it to be daytime for as long as possible.\\n\\n We’re at my house, hanging out by the pool. I asked Rennie to come over so we could talk, but then she invited Ashlin.\\n\\n I’m lying on a lounge chair, trying to figure out what I’m going to say to Rennie. I’ll ask her to stay longer when Ash leaves, and I’ll give her the chance to explain herself, to tell me what the hell is going on between Alex and Nadia, but then that’s it. We’re done.\\n\\n I’m going over it again in my mind when I hear music growing louder. Bass. I put my sweater on over my two-piece and walk to the gate. Through the slats I watch as Alex’s SUV pulls into my driveway, with Reeve, Derek, and PJ inside.\\n\\n I spin around. Rennie’s already paddling her arms to get to the ladder.\\n\\n “Why did you invite them?”\\n\\n She shakes her head, like I’m being ridiculous. “Reeve texted me before practice and asked what I was doing. So . . . I told him. Why?”\\n\\n If Nadia was home, I would lock the gate. But she’s not. She went to her friend’s house to work on cheer routines.\\n\\n The boys come in, sweaty and grass-stained from practice.\\n\\n Ashlin runs up and hugs Derek, but quickly peels herself off him. “Eww. You guys stink.”\\n\\n Reeve grins at PJ, and in a second they both strip down to their boxers and dive into the pool. Derek cannonballs behind them, and then Ashlin and Rennie hold hands and jump in too.\\n\\n As soon as they hit, Alex takes a seat on one of the lounge chairs. Not exactly near me, but definitely closer than I want him to be. I put Rennie’s sunglasses on after all, to hide how angry I am.\\n\\n My mom must hear the splashing, because she comes out the patio door. Right away Reeve and PJ chorus from the pool, “Hi, Mrs. Cho!”\\n\\n “Hi, boys!” Then she notices Alex sitting by me. “Alex! How are you?” She loves Alex.\\n\\n He stands up like the fake gentleman he is. “Hi, Mrs. Cho. Did you get your hair cut? It looks nice.”\\n\\n My mom beams at me like, Wow, isn’t he something? Yeah, he’s something all right. “As a matter of fact, I did. Thank you for noticing, Alex.”\\n\\n I keep expecting Alex to try to make eye contact with me. But he doesn’t. He looks everywhere but at me. Maybe he’s still mad at me. Or maybe it’s his guilty conscience.\\n\\n When my mom goes back inside, the guys come out of the water. Like a king Reeve goes, “Somebody towel me up.”\\n\\n Rennie says, “Lil, you have towels for them, right?”\\n\\n “Actually, no,” I say. “Our housekeeper is doing the wash right now. The most I could give you is a dishrag. Or paper towels. Sorry.”\\n\\n Ashlin and Rennie share a look. PJ makes a sad face at me and starts to shiver. I roll my eyes and throw him my towel. PJ gives me a big smile. “Thanks, Lil!”\\n\\n “Yeah, thanks a lot,” Reeve says.\\n\\n Ashlin lets Derek borrow her towel. Rennie holds out hers for Reeve, but he declines the offer. Instead he just runs his hands over his abs, wicking away the water, and grabs his clothes. “There’s a real shortage of hospitality up in here. You ready, Alex?”\\n\\n “Yup.”\\n\\n I walk over and open the gate for them. “Bye,” I say.\\n\\n Reeve makes a peace sign at me and leaves, shaking his head. Since when is Reeve Tabatsky the authority on manners? I’ve seen him pick food out of the garbage. It was at Alex’s house, but still.\\n\\n The boys file out behind Reeve, and Rennie and Ashlin go inside to change. I get up and lean against the fence. That’s when I overhear a conversation on the other side. Because Alex hasn’t left yet. His SUV is still in my driveway.\\n\\n I hear Reeve say, “God, Cho is such a bitch. Do you think she knows that you and Nadia had a sleepover?”\\n\\n I gasp.\\n\\n “No way. Nadia swore to her that she slept at that girl Janelle’s house. There’s no way she’d tell her.”\\n\\n “You’d better hope not,” Derek says.\\n\\n Then Reeve says, “Bro, what are you even getting out of all this? I say you just stick with DeBrassio. I give that girl respect. She knows what kind of girl she is.”\\n\\n Alex starts his SUV. “I know what I’m doing.”\\n\\n Rennie comes up behind me and puts her hand on my shoulder. I jump, and say, “Hey. Where’s Ash?”\\n\\n “She’s peeing. Lil, I don’t know how else to say this to you, but . . . you need to get it together.”\\n\\n “What do you mean?” My mind is still racing. Nadia slept over at a boy’s house. Not just any boy. Lindy. Someone I thought was my friend. Who’d never do something like that. I don’t know why I’ve been so naive. Boys, they aren’t to be trusted. Not any of them.\\n\\n “Those guys are our friends, and you don’t want to give them a towel? Today is Wednesday. Carlota isn’t even here today. I wasn’t going to call you out in front of everyone, but come on.” She looks around before lowering her voice. “Lil, you need to chill, or people are going to figure out something’s wrong.”\\n\\n I can’t think straight. I lean against the fence, use it to hold myself up. “You’re right,” I manage to say. I’ll tell her whatever I have to, just to shut her up.\\n\\n But she doesn’t. Her eyes light up. “OMG! I didn’t even tell you what happened at Bow Tie last night.”\\n\\n This is it. Finally. “What?”\\n\\n “Reeve and I kissed! I mean, it was only for a second. He pulled away and told me that I was too important to him to just be a random hookup. Isn’t that the sweetest thing you’ve ever heard? I’m telling you, we’re like this close to being an official couple.” She does a spin, like she’s already wearing her wedding dress.\\n\\n I force a smile. “You guys are perfect for each other. Honestly.”\\n\\n * * *\\n\\n After dinner I hear Nadia in the den, watching television, but I don’t join her. I could barely stand to look at her from across the kitchen table. I go straight up to my room, lie down on my bed, and wonder what I’m going to do now that I can’t trust anyone.\\n\\n My phone buzzes, and I reach over to my nightstand to pick it up. It’s a text from a number I don’t recognize.\\n\\n This is Karma. I’m a bitch. Can you think of anyone who deserves a bitch slap?\\n\\n Oh, yes, I can. I can think of a few. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/burn-for-burn-burn-for-burn-1/page-19.html","bookId":2726,"book":{"id":2726,"title":"Burn for Burn (Burn for Burn #1)","description":"Storyline: Postcard-perfect Jar Island is home to charming tourist shops, pristine beaches, amazing oceanfront homes—and three girls secretly plotting revenge. \\n KAT is sick and tired of being bullied by her former best friend. \\n LILLIA has always looked out for her little sister, so when she discovers that one of her guy friends has been secretly hooking up with her, she’s going to put a stop to it. \\n MARY is perpetually haunted by a traumatic event from years past, and the boy who’s responsible has yet to get what’s coming to him. \\n None of the girls can act on their revenge fantasies alone without being suspected.
