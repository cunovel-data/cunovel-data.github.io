{"id":2548,"no":14,"title":"Chapter 14","content":"14:1 [hgb] 过 两 天 是 逾 越 节 ， 又 是 除 酵 节 。 祭 司 长 和 文 士 ， 想 法 子 怎 么 用 诡 计 捉 拿 耶 稣 杀 他 。 [kjv] After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death. [bbe] It was now two days before the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes made designs how they might take him by deceit and put him to death: 14:2 [hgb] 只 是 说 ， 当 节 的 日 子 不 可 ， 恐 怕 百 姓 生 乱 。 [kjv] But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the people. [bbe] But they said, Not while the feast is going on, for fear there may be trouble among the people. 14:3 [hgb] 耶 稣 在 伯 大 尼 长 大 麻 疯 的 西 门 家 里 坐 席 的 时 候 ， 有 一 个 女 人 ， 拿 着 一 玉 瓶 至 贵 的 真 哪 哒 香 膏 来 ， 打 破 玉 瓶 ， 把 膏 浇 在 耶 稣 的 头 上 。 [kjv] And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his head. [bbe] And while he was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, seated at table, there came a woman with a bottle of perfumed oil of great price; and when the bottle was broken she put the perfume on his head. 14:4 [hgb] 有 几 个 人 心 中 很 不 喜 悦 ， 说 ， 何 用 这 样 枉 费 香 膏 呢 ？ [kjv] And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made? [bbe] But some of them were angry among themselves, saying, For what purpose has this oil been wasted? 14:5 [hgb] 这 香 膏 可 以 卖 三 十 多 两 银 子 周 济 穷 人 。 他 们 就 向 那 女 人 生 气 。 [kjv] For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her. [bbe] We might have got more than three hundred pence for it, and given the money to the poor. And they said things against her among themselves. 14:6 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 由 她 吧 。 为 什 么 难 为 她 呢 ？ 她 在 我 身 上 作 的 是 一 件 美 事 。 [kjv] And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me. [bbe] But Jesus said, Let her be; why are you troubling her? she has done a kind act to me. 14:7 [hgb] 因 为 常 有 穷 人 和 你 们 同 在 ， 要 向 他 们 行 善 ， 随 时 都 可 以 。 只 是 你 们 不 常 有 我 。 [kjv] For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always. [bbe] The poor you have ever with you, and whenever you have the desire you may do them good: but me you have not for ever. 14:8 [hgb] 她 所 作 的 ， 是 尽 她 所 能 的 。 她 是 为 我 安 葬 的 事 ， 把 香 膏 预 先 浇 在 我 身 上 。 [kjv] She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying. [bbe] She has done what she was able: she has put oil on my body to make it ready for its last resting-place. 14:9 [hgb] 我 实 在 告 诉 你 们 ， 普 天 之 下 ， 无 论 在 什 么 地 方 传 这 福 音 ， 也 要 述 说 这 女 人 所 作 的 以 为 记 念 。 [kjv] Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her. [bbe] And truly I say to you, Wherever the good news goes out through all the earth, what this woman has done will be talked of in memory of her. 14:10 [hgb] 十 二 门 徒 之 中 有 一 个 加 略 人 犹 大 ， 去 见 祭 司 长 ， 要 把 耶 稣 交 给 他 们 。 [kjv] And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them. [bbe] And Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, so that he might give him up to them. 14:11 [hgb] 他 们 听 见 就 欢 喜 ， 又 应 许 给 他 银 子 。 他 就 寻 思 如 何 得 便 ， 把 耶 稣 交 给 他 们 。 [kjv] And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him. [bbe] And hearing what he said, they were glad, and gave him their word to make him a payment of money. And he took thought how he might best give him up to them. 14:12 [hgb] 除 酵 节 的 第 一 天 ， 就 是 宰 逾 越 羊 羔 的 那 一 天 ， 门 徒 对 耶 稣 说 ， 你 吃 逾 越 节 的 筵 席 ， 要 我 们 往 哪 里 去 预 备 呢 ？ [kjv] And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover? [bbe] And on the first day of unleavened bread, when the Passover lamb is put to death, his disciples said to him, Where are we to go and make ready for you to take the Passover meal? 14:13 [hgb] 耶 稣 就 打 发 两 个 门 徒 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 进 城 去 ， 必 有 人 拿 着 一 瓶 水 ， 迎 面 而 来 。 你 们 就 跟 着 他 。 [kjv] And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him. [bbe] And he sent two of his disciples, and said to them, Go into the town, and there will come to you a man with a vessel of water: go after him; 14:14 [hgb] 他 进 那 家 去 ， 你 们 就 对 那 家 的 主 人 说 ， 夫 子 说 ， 客 房 在 哪 里 ？ 我 与 门 徒 好 在 那 里 吃 逾 越 节 的 筵 席 。 [kjv] And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? [bbe] And wherever he goes in, say to the owner of the house, The Master says, Where is my guest-room, where I may take the Passover with my disciples? 14:15 [hgb] 他 必 指 给 你 们 摆 设 整 齐 的 一 间 大 楼 ， 你 们 就 在 那 里 为 我 们 预 备 。 [kjv] And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us. [bbe] And he will take you up himself to a great room with a table and seats: there make ready for us. 14:16 [hgb] 门 徒 出 去 ， 进 了 城 ， 所 遇 见 的 ， 正 如 耶 稣 所 说 的 。 他 们 就 预 备 了 逾 越 节 的 筵 席 [kjv] And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover. [bbe] And the disciples went out and came into the town, and saw that it was as he had said: and they made ready the Passover. 14:17 [hgb] 到 了 晚 上 ， 耶 稣 和 十 二 个 门 徒 都 来 了 。 [kjv] And in the evening he cometh with the twelve. [bbe] And when it was evening he came with the twelve. 14:18 [hgb] 他 们 坐 席 正 吃 的 时 候 ， 耶 稣 说 ， 我 实 在 告 诉 你 们 ， 你 们 中 间 有 一 个 与 我 同 吃 的 人 要 卖 我 了 。 [kjv] And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me. [bbe] And while they were seated taking food, Jesus said, Truly I say to you, One of you will be false to me, one who is taking food with me. 14:19 [hgb] 他 们 就 忧 愁 起 来 ， 一 个 一 个 地 问 他 说 ， 是 我 吗 ？ [kjv] And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I? [bbe] They were sad, and said to him one by one, Is it I? 14:20 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 是 十 二 个 门 徒 中 同 我 蘸 手 在 盘 子 里 的 那 个 人 。 [kjv] And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish. [bbe] And he said to them, It is one of the twelve, one who is putting his bread with me into the same plate. 14:21 [hgb] 人 子 必 要 去 世 ， 正 如 经 上 指 着 他 所 写 的 。 但 卖 人 子 的 人 有 祸 了 ， 那 人 不 生 在 世 上 倒 好 。 [kjv] The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born. [bbe] The Son of man goes, even as the Writings say of him: but cursed is that man through whom the Son of man is given up! It would have been well for that man if he had never been given birth. 14:22 [hgb] 他 们 吃 的 时 候 ， 耶 稣 拿 起 饼 来 ， 祝 了 福 ， 就 掰 开 递 给 他 们 说 ， 你 们 拿 着 吃 。 这 是 我 的 身 体 。 [kjv] And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body. [bbe] And while they were taking food, he took bread, and after blessing it, he gave the broken bread to them, and said, Take it: this is my body. 14:23 [hgb] 又 拿 起 杯 来 ， 祝 谢 了 ， 递 给 他 们 。 他 们 都 喝 了 。 [kjv] And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it. [bbe] And he took a cup, and when he had given praise, he gave it to them: and they all had a drink from it. 14:24 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 这 是 我 立 约 的 血 ， 为 多 人 流 出 来 的 。 [kjv] And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many. [bbe] And he said to them, This is my blood of the testament, which is given for men. 14:25 [hgb] 我 实 在 告 诉 你 们 ， 我 不 再 喝 这 葡 萄 汁 ， 直 到 我 在 神 的 国 里 ， 喝 新 的 那 日 子 。 [kjv] Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God. [bbe] Truly I say to you, I will take no more of the fruit of the vine till the day when I take it new in the kingdom of God. 14:26 [hgb] 他 们 唱 了 诗 ， 就 出 来 ， 往 橄 榄 山 去 。 [kjv] And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives. [bbe] And after a song of praise to God they went out to the Mountain of Olives. 14:27 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 都 要 跌 倒 了 。 因 为 经 上 记 着 说 ， 我 要 击 打 牧 人 ， 羊 就 分 散 了 。 [kjv] And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered. [bbe] And Jesus said to them, You will all be turned away from me: for it is in the Writings, I will put the keeper of the sheep to death, and the sheep will be put to flight. 14:28 [hgb] 但 我 复 活 以 后 ， 要 在 你 们 以 先 往 加 利 利 去 。 [kjv] But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee. [bbe] But after I have come back from the dead, I will go before you into Galilee. 14:29 [hgb] 彼 得 说 ， 众 人 虽 然 跌 倒 ， 我 总 不 能 。 [kjv] But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I. [bbe] But Peter said to him, Though the others may be turned away from you, I will not. 14:30 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 说 ， 我 实 在 告 诉 你 ， 就 在 今 天 夜 里 ， 鸡 叫 两 遍 以 先 ， 你 要 三 次 不 认 我 。 [kjv] And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. [bbe] And Jesus said to him, Truly, I say to you that you, today, even this night, before the cock\u0027s second cry, will say three times that you have no knowledge of me. 14:31 [hgb] 彼 得 却 极 力 地 说 ， 我 就 是 必 须 和 你 同 死 ， 也 总 不 能 不 认 你 。 众 门 徒 都 是 这 样 说 。 [kjv] But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all. [bbe] But he said with passion, If I have to be put to death with you, I will not be false to you. And they all said the same. 14:32 [hgb] 他 们 来 到 一 个 地 方 ， 名 叫 客 西 马 尼 。 耶 稣 对 门 徒 说 ， 你 们 坐 在 这 里 ， 等 我 祷 告 。 [kjv] And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray. [bbe] And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he said to his disciples, Be seated here while I say a prayer. 14:33 [hgb] 于 是 带 着 彼 得 ， 雅 各 ， 约 翰 同 去 ， 就 惊 恐 起 来 ， 极 其 难 过 。 [kjv] And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy; [bbe] And he took with him Peter and James and John, and grief and great trouble came on him. 14:34 [hgb] 对 他 们 说 ， 我 心 里 甚 是 忧 伤 ， 几 乎 要 死 。 你 们 在 这 里 ， 等 候 儆 醒 。 [kjv] And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch. [bbe] And he said to them, My soul is very sad, even to death: be here a little time, and keep watch. 14:35 [hgb] 他 就 稍 往 前 走 ， 俯 伏 在 地 祷 告 说 ， 倘 若 可 行 ， 便 叫 那 时 候 过 去 。 [kjv] And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. [bbe] And he went forward a little, and falling down on the earth, made request that, if possible, the hour might go from him. 14:36 [hgb] 他 说 ， 阿 爸 ， 父 阿 ， 在 你 凡 事 都 能 。 求 你 将 这 杯 撤 去 。 然 而 不 要 从 我 的 意 思 ， 只 要 从 你 的 意 思 。 [kjv] And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt. [bbe] And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to you; take away this cup from me: but even so let not my pleasure, but yours be done. 14:37 [hgb] 耶 稣 回 来 ， 见 他 们 睡 着 了 ， 就 对 彼 得 说 ， 西 门 ， 你 睡 觉 吗 ？ 不 能 儆 醒 片 时 吗 ？ [kjv] And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour? [bbe] And he came, and saw them sleeping, and said to Peter, Simon, are you sleeping? were you not able to keep watch one hour? 14:38 [hgb] 总 要 儆 醒 祷 告 ， 免 得 入 了 迷 惑 。 你 们 心 灵 固 然 愿 意 ， 肉 体 却 软 弱 了 。 [kjv] Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak. [bbe] Keep watch with prayer, so that you may not be put to the test; the spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is feeble. 14:39 [hgb] 耶 稣 又 去 祷 告 ， 说 的 话 还 是 与 先 前 一 样 。 [kjv] And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words. [bbe] And again he went away, and said a prayer, using the same words. 14:40 [hgb] 又 来 见 他 们 睡 着 了 ， 因 为 他 们 的 眼 睛 甚 是 困 倦 。 他 们 也 不 知 道 怎 么 回 答 。 [kjv] And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him. [bbe] And again he came and saw them sleeping, because their eyes were very tired; and they had nothing to say in answer. 14:41 [hgb] 第 三 次 来 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 现 在 你 们 仍 然 睡 觉 安 歇 吧 。 （ 吧 或 作 吗 ） 够 了 ， 时 候 到 了 。 看 哪 ， 人 子 被 卖 在 罪 人 手 里 了 。 [kjv] And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. [bbe] And he came the third time, and said to them, Go on sleeping now and take your rest: it is enough; the hour has come; see, the Son of man is given up into the hands of evil men. 14:42 [hgb] 起 来 ， 我 们 走 吧 。 看 哪 ， 那 卖 我 的 人 近 了 。 [kjv] Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand. [bbe] Get up, let us be going; see, he who gives me up is near. 14:43 [hgb] 说 话 之 间 ， 忽 然 那 十 二 个 门 徒 里 的 犹 大 来 了 ， 并 有 许 多 人 带 着 刀 棒 ， 从 祭 司 长 和 文 士 并 长 老 那 里 与 他 同 来 。 [kjv] And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. [bbe] And straight away, while he was still talking, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great band with swords and sticks, from the chief priests and the scribes and those in authority. 14:44 [hgb] 卖 耶 稣 的 人 曾 给 他 们 一 个 暗 号 ， 说 ， 我 与 谁 亲 嘴 ， 谁 就 是 他 。 你 们 把 他 拿 住 ， 牢 牢 靠 靠 的 带 去 。 [kjv] And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely. [bbe] Now he who had been false to him had given them a sign, saying, The one to whom I give a kiss, that is he; take him, and get him away safely. 14:45 [hgb] 犹 大 来 了 ， 随 即 到 耶 稣 跟 前 说 ， 拉 比 ， 便 与 他 亲 嘴 。 [kjv] And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him. [bbe] And when he had come, he went straight to him and said, Master; and gave him a kiss. 14:46 [hgb] 他 们 就 下 手 拿 住 他 。 [kjv] And they laid their hands on him, and took him. [bbe] And they put their hands on him, and took him. 14:47 [hgb] 旁 边 站 着 的 人 ， 有 一 个 拔 出 刀 来 ， 将 大 祭 司 的 仆 人 砍 了 一 刀 ， 削 掉 了 他 一 个 耳 朵 。 [kjv] And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear. [bbe] But a certain one of those who were near took out his sword, and gave the servant of the high priest a blow, cutting off his ear. 14:48 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 带 着 刀 棒 ， 出 来 拿 我 ， 如 同 拿 强 盗 吗 ？ [kjv] And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me? [bbe] And Jesus said to them, Have you come out as against a thief, with swords and sticks to take me? 14:49 [hgb] 我 天 天 教 训 人 ， 同 你 们 在 殿 里 ， 你 们 并 没 有 拿 我 。 但 这 事 成 就 ， 为 要 应 验 经 上 的 话 。 [kjv] I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled. [bbe] I was with you every day in the Temple teaching, and you did not take me; but this is done so that the Writings may come true. 14:50 [hgb] 门 徒 都 离 开 他 逃 走 了 。 [kjv] And they all forsook him, and fled. [bbe] And they all went away from him in fear. 14:51 [hgb] 有 一 个 少 年 人 ， 赤 身 披 着 一 块 麻 布 ， 跟 随 耶 稣 ， 众 人 就 捉 拿 他 。 [kjv] And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him: [bbe] And a certain young man went after him, with only a linen cloth about his body; and they put their hands on him; 14:52 [hgb] 他 却 丢 了 麻 布 ， 赤 身 逃 走 了 。 [kjv] And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked. [bbe] But he got away unclothed, without the linen cloth. 14:53 [hgb] 他 们 把 耶 稣 带 到 大 祭 司 那 里 。 又 有 众 祭 司 长 和 长 老 并 文 士 ， 都 来 和 大 祭 司 一 同 聚 集 。 [kjv] And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes. [bbe] And they took Jesus away to the high priest; and there came together with him all the chief priests and those in authority and the scribes. 14:54 [hgb] 彼 得 远 远 地 跟 着 耶 稣 ， 一 直 进 入 大 祭 司 的 院 里 ， 和 差 役 一 同 坐 在 火 光 里 烤 火 。 [kjv] And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire. [bbe] And Peter had come after him at a distance, even into the house of the high priest; and he was seated with the captains, warming himself in the light of the fire. 14:55 [hgb] 祭 司 长 和 全 公 会 寻 找 见 证 控 告 耶 稣 ， 要 治 死 他 。 却 寻 不 着 。 [kjv] And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none. [bbe] Now the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin were looking for witness against Jesus so that they might put him to death; and they were unable to get any. 14:56 [hgb] 因 为 有 好 些 人 作 假 见 证 告 他 ， 只 是 他 们 的 见 证 ， 各 不 相 合 。 [kjv] For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together. [bbe] For a number gave false witness against him and their witness was not in agreement. 14:57 [hgb] 又 有 几 个 人 站 起 来 ， 作 假 见 证 告 他 说 ， [kjv] And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying, [bbe] Then some got up and gave false witness against him, saying, 14:58 [hgb] 我 们 听 见 他 说 ， 我 要 拆 毁 这 人 手 所 造 的 殿 ， 三 日 内 就 另 造 一 座 不 是 人 手 所 造 的 。 [kjv] We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands. [bbe] He said in our hearing, I will put an end to this Temple which is made with hands, and in three days I will make another without hands. 14:59 [hgb] 他 们 就 是 这 么 作 见 证 ， 也 是 各 不 相 合 。 [kjv] But neither so did their witness agree together. [bbe] And even so their witness was not in agreement. 14:60 [hgb] 大 祭 司 起 来 ， 站 在 中 间 ， 问 耶 稣 说 ， 你 什 么 都 不 回 答 吗 ？ 这 些 人 作 见 证 告 你 的 是 什 么 呢 ？ [kjv] And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee? [bbe] And the high priest got up in the middle of them, and said to Jesus, Do you say nothing in answer? what is it which these say against you? 14:61 [hgb] 耶 稣 却 不 言 语 ， 一 句 也 不 回 答 。 大 祭 司 又 问 他 说 ， 你 是 那 当 称 颂 者 的 儿 子 基 督 不 是 。 [kjv] But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? [bbe] But he kept quiet and said nothing. Again the high priest questioning him said, Are you the Christ, the son of the Holy One? 14:62 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 我 是 。 你 们 必 看 见 人 子 ， 坐 在 那 权 能 者 的 右 边 ， 驾 着 天 上 的 云 降 临 。 [kjv] And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. [bbe] And Jesus said, I am: and you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven. 14:63 [hgb] 大 祭 司 就 撕 开 衣 服 ， 说 ， 我 们 何 必 再 用 见 证 人 呢 ？ [kjv] Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses? [bbe] And the high priest, violently parting his robes, said, What more need have we of witnesses? 14:64 [hgb] 你 们 已 经 听 见 他 这 僭 妄 的 话 了 。 你 们 的 意 见 如 何 ？ 他 们 都 定 他 该 死 的 罪 。 [kjv] Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death. [bbe] His words against God have come to your ears: what is your opinion? And they all said it was right for him to be put to death. 14:65 [hgb] 就 有 人 吐 唾 沫 在 他 脸 上 ， 又 蒙 着 他 的 脸 ， 用 拳 头 打 他 ， 对 他 说 ， 你 说 预 言 吧 。 差 役 接 过 他 来 用 手 掌 打 他 。 [kjv] And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands. [bbe] And some put shame on him and, covering his face, gave him blows and said to him, Now say what is to come: and the captains took him and gave him blows with their hands. 14:66 [hgb] 彼 得 在 下 边 ， 院 子 里 ， 来 了 大 祭 司 的 一 个 使 女 。 [kjv] And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest: [bbe] And while Peter was down in the open square of the building, one of the servant-girls of the high priest came; 14:67 [hgb] 见 彼 得 烤 火 ， 就 看 着 他 说 ， 你 素 来 也 是 同 拿 撒 勒 人 耶 稣 一 伙 的 。 [kjv] And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth. [bbe] And seeing Peter warming himself by the fire, she gave him a look, and said, You were with this Nazarene, even Jesus. 14:68 [hgb] 彼 得 却 不 承 认 ， 说 ， 我 不 知 道 ， 也 不 明 白 你 说 的 是 什 么 。 于 是 出 来 ， 到 了 前 院 。 鸡 就 叫 了 。 [kjv] But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew. [bbe] But he said, I have no knowledge of him, or of what you are saying: and he went out into the doorway; and there came the cry of a cock. 14:69 [hgb] 那 使 女 看 见 他 ， 又 对 旁 边 站 着 的 人 说 ， 这 也 是 他 们 一 党 的 。 [kjv] And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them. [bbe] And the girl saw him, and said again to those who were near, This is one of them. 14:70 [hgb] 彼 得 又 不 承 认 。 过 了 不 多 的 时 候 ， 旁 边 站 着 的 人 又 对 彼 得 说 ， 你 真 是 他 们 一 党 的 。 因 为 你 是 加 利 利 人 。 [kjv] And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto. [bbe] But again he said it was not so. And after a little time, again those who were near said to Peter, Truly you are one of them; for you are a Galilaean. 14:71 [hgb] 彼 得 就 发 咒 起 誓 地 说 ， 我 不 认 得 你 们 说 的 这 个 人 。 [kjv] But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak. [bbe] But, with curses and oaths, he said, I have no knowledge of the man about whom you are talking. 14:72 [hgb] 立 时 鸡 叫 了 第 二 遍 。 彼 得 想 起 耶 稣 对 他 所 说 的 话 ， 鸡 叫 两 遍 以 先 ， 你 要 三 次 不 认 我 。 思 想 起 来 ， 就 哭 了 。 [kjv] And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept. [bbe] And in the same minute, the cock gave a second cry. And it came to Peter\u0027s mind how Jesus had said to him, Before the cock\u0027s second cry, you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me. And at this thought he was overcome with weeping.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/156/2161.html","bookId":102,"book":{"id":102,"title":"马可福音 Mark","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 神 的 儿 子 ， 耶 稣 基 督 福 音 的 起 头 ， [kjv] The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God; [bbe] The first words of the ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/156","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
