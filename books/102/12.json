A certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country. \n [bbe] And he gave them teaching in the form of stories. A man had a vine-garden planted, and put a wall about it, and made a place for crushing out the wine, and put up a tower, and let it out to field-workers, and went into another country. \n 12:2 [hgb] 到 了 时 候 ， 打 发 一 个 仆 人 到 园 户 那 里 ， 要 从 园 户 收 葡 萄 园 的 果 子 。 \n [kjv] And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard. \n [bbe] And when the time came, he sent a servant to get from the workmen some of the fruit of the garden. \n 12:3 [hgb] 园 户 拿 住 他 ， 打 了 他 ， 叫 他 空 手 回 去 。 \n [kjv] And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty. \n [bbe] And they took him, and gave him blows, and sent him away with nothing. \n 12:4 [hgb] 再 打 发 一 个 仆 人 到 他 们 那 里 。 他 们 打 伤 他 的 头 ， 并 且 凌 辱 他 。 \n [kjv] And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled. \n [bbe] And again he sent to them another servant; and they gave him wounds on the head, and were very cruel to him. \n 12:5 [hgb] 又 打 发 一 个 仆 人 去 。 他 们 就 杀 了 他 。 后 又 打 发 好 些 仆 人 去 。 有 被 他 们 打 的 ， 有 被 他 们 杀 的 。 \n [kjv] And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some. \n [bbe] And he sent another; and they put him to death: and a number of others, whipping some, and putting some to death. \n 12:6 [hgb] 园 主 还 有 一 位 ， 是 他 的 爱 子 ， 末 后 又 打 发 他 去 ， 意 思 说 ， 他 们 必 尊 敬 我 的 儿 子 。 \n [kjv] Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son. \n [bbe] He still had one, a dearly loved son: he sent him last to them, saying, They will have respect for my son. \n 12:7 [hgb] 不 料 ， 那 些 园 户 彼 此 说 ， 这 是 承 受 产 业 的 。 来 吧 ， 我 们 杀 他 ， 产 业 就 归 我 们 了 。 \n [kjv] But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be our\u0027s. \n [bbe] But those workmen said among themselves, This is he who will one day be the owner of the property; come, let us put him to death, and the heritage will be ours. \n 12:8 [hgb] 于 是 拿 住 他 ， 杀 了 他 ， 把 他 丢 在 园 外 。 \n [kjv] And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard. \n [bbe] And they took him and put him to death, pushing his body out of the garden. \n 12:9 [hgb] 这 样 ， 葡 萄 园 的 主 人 要 怎 样 办 呢 ？ 他 要 来 除 灭 那 些 园 户 ， 将 葡 萄 园 转 给 别 人 。 \n [kjv] What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others. \n [bbe] What then will the master of the garden do? He will come and put the workmen to death, and will give the garden into the hands of others. \n 12:10 [hgb] 经 上 写 着 说 匠 人 所 弃 的 石 头 ， 已 作 了 房 角 的 头 块 石 头 。 \n [kjv] And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner: \n [bbe] Have you not seen this which is in the Writings: The stone which the builders put on one side, the same was made the chief stone of the building: \n 12:11 [hgb] 这 是 主 所 作 的 ， 在 我 们 眼 中 看 为 希 奇 。 这 经 你 们 没 有 念 过 吗 ？ \n [kjv] This was the Lord\u0027s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes? \n [bbe] This was the Lord\u0027s doing, and it is a wonder in our eyes? \n 12:12 [hgb] 他 们 看 出 这 比 喻 是 指 着 他 们 说 的 ， 就 想 要 捉 拿 他 ， 只 是 惧 怕 百 姓 。 于 是 离 开 他 走 了 。 \n [kjv] And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way. \n [bbe] And they made attempts to take him; but they were in fear of the people, because they saw that the story was against them; and they went away from him. \n 12:13 [hgb] 后 来 他 们 打 发 几 个 法 利 赛 人 和 几 个 希 律 党 的 人 ， 到 耶 稣 那 里 ， 要 就 着 他 的 话 陷 害 他 。 \n [kjv] And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words. \n [bbe] Then they sent to him certain of the Pharisees and the Herodians, so that they might make use of his words to take him by a trick. \n 12:14 [hgb] 他 们 来 了 ， 就 对 他 说 ， 夫 子 ， 我 们 知 道 你 是 诚 实 的 ， 什 么 人 你 都 不 徇 情 面 。 因 为 你 不 看 人 的 外 貌 ， 乃 是 诚 诚 实 实 传 神 的 道 。 纳 税 给 该 撒 可 以 不 可 以 。 \n [kjv] And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? \n [bbe] And when they had come, they said to him, Master, we are certain that you are true, and have no fear of anyone: you have no respect for a man\u0027s position, but you are teaching the true way of God: Is it right to give taxes to Caesar or not? \n 12:15 [hgb] 我 们 该 纳 不 该 纳 。 耶 稣 知 道 他 们 的 假 意 ， 就 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 为 什 么 试 探 我 。 拿 一 个 银 钱 来 给 我 看 。 \n [kjv] Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it. \n [bbe] Are we to give or not to give? But he, conscious of their false hearts, said to them, Why do you put me to the test? give me a penny, so that I may see it. \n 12:16 [hgb] 他 们 就 拿 了 来 。 耶 稣 说 ， 这 像 和 这 号 是 谁 的 。 他 们 说 ， 是 该 撒 的 。 \n [kjv] And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar\u0027s. \n [bbe] And they gave him one. And he said to them, Whose is this image and name on it? And they said to him, Caesar\u0027s. \n 12:17 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 该 撒 的 物 当 归 给 该 撒 ， 神 的 物 当 归 给 神 。 他 们 就 很 希 奇 他 。 \n [kjv] And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u0027s, and to God the things that are God\u0027s. And they marvelled at him. \n [bbe] And Jesus said to them, Give to Caesar the things which are Caesar\u0027s, and to God the things which are God\u0027s. And they were full of wonder at him. \n 12:18 [hgb] 撒 都 该 人 常 说 ， 没 有 复 活 的 事 。 他 们 来 问 耶 稣 说 ， \n [kjv] Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying, \n [bbe] And there came to him Sadducees, who say there is no coming back from the dead; and they put a question to him, saying, \n 12:19 [hgb] 夫 子 ， 摩 西 为 我 们 写 着 说 ， 人 若 死 了 ， 撇 下 妻 子 ， 没 有 孩 子 ， 他 兄 弟 当 娶 他 的 妻 ， 为 哥 哥 生 子 立 后 。 \n [kjv] Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man\u0027s brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. \n [bbe] Master, in the law Moses says, If a man\u0027s brother comes to his end, and has a wife still living and no child, it is right for his brother to take his wife, and get a family for his brother. \n 12:20 [hgb] 有 弟 兄 七 人 ， 第 一 个 娶 了 妻 ， 死 了 ， 没 有 留 下 孩 子 。 \n [kjv] Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed. \n [bbe] There were seven brothers: and the first took a wife, and at his death there were no offspring; \n 12:21 [hgb] 第 二 个 娶 了 她 ， 也 死 了 ， 没 有 留 下 孩 子 。 第 三 个 也 是 这 样 。 \n [kjv] And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise. \n [bbe] And the second took her, and at his death there were no offspring; and the third the same: \n 12:22 [hgb] 那 七 个 人 都 没 有 留 下 孩 子 。 末 了 ， 那 妇 人 也 死 了 。 \n [kjv] And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also. \n [bbe] And all the seven had no seed. Last of all the woman herself came to her death. \n 12:23 [hgb] 当 复 活 的 时 候 ， 她 是 哪 一 个 的 妻 子 呢 ？ 因 为 他 们 七 个 人 都 娶 过 她 。 \n [kjv] In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife. \n [bbe] In the future life, when they come back from the dead, whose wife will she be? for the seven had her for a wife. \n 12:24 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 你 们 所 以 错 了 ， 岂 不 是 因 为 不 明 白 圣 经 ， 不 晓 得 神 的 大 能 吗 ？ \n [kjv] And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God? \n [bbe] Jesus said to them, Is not this the reason for your error, that you have no knowledge of the holy Writings or of the power of God? \n 12:25 [hgb] 人 从 死 里 复 活 ， 也 不 娶 ， 也 不 嫁 ， 乃 像 天 上 的 使 者 一 样 。 \n [kjv] For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven. \n [bbe] When they come back from the dead, they do not get married, but are like the angels in heaven. \n 12:26 [hgb] 论 到 死 人 复 活 ， 你 们 没 有 念 过 摩 西 的 书 ， 荆 棘 篇 上 所 载 的 吗 ？ 神 对 摩 西 说 ， 我 是 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 神 ， 以 撒 的 神 ， 雅 各 的 神 。 \n [kjv] And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? \n [bbe] But as to the dead coming back to life; have you not seen in the book of Moses, about the burning thorn-tree, how God said to him, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? \n 12:27 [hgb] 神 不 是 死 人 的 神 ， 乃 是 活 人 的 神 。 你 们 是 大 错 了 。 \n [kjv] He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err. \n [bbe] He is not the God of the dead, but of the living: you are greatly in error. \n 12:28 [hgb] 有 一 个 文 士 来 ， 听 见 他 们 辩 论 ， 晓 得 耶 稣 回 答 得 好 ， 就 问 他 说 ， 诫 命 中 哪 是 第 一 要 紧 的 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all? \n [bbe] And one of the scribes came, and hearing their argument together, and seeing that he had given them a good answer, put the question to him, Which law is the first of all? \n 12:29 [hgb] 耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 第 一 要 紧 的 ， 就 是 说 ， 以 色 列 阿 ， 你 要 听 。 主 我 们 神 ， 是 独 一 的 主 。 \n [kjv] And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord: \n [bbe] Jesus said in answer, The first is, Give ear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord; \n 12:30 [hgb] 你 要 尽 心 ， 尽 性 ， 尽 意 ， 尽 力 ， 爱 主 你 的 神 。 \n [kjv] And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment. \n [bbe] And you are to have love for the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength. \n 12:31 [hgb] 其 次 ， 就 是 说 ， 要 爱 人 如 己 。 再 没 有 比 这 两 条 诫 命 更 大 的 了 。 \n [kjv] And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these. \n [bbe] The second is this, Have love for your neighbour as for yourself. There is no other law greater than these. \n 12:32 [hgb] 那 文 士 对 耶 稣 说 ， 夫 子 说 ， 神 是 一 位 ， 实 在 不 错 。 除 了 他 以 外 ， 再 没 有 别 的 神 。 \n [kjv] And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he: \n [bbe] And the scribe said to him, Truly, Master, you have well said that he is one, and there is no other but he: \n 12:33 [hgb] 并 且 尽 心 ， 尽 智 ， 尽 力 爱 他 ， 又 爱 人 如 己 ， 就 比 一 切 燔 祭 ， 和 各 样 祭 祀 ， 好 得 多 。 \n [kjv] And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. \n [bbe] And to have love for him with all the heart, and with all the mind, and with all the strength, and to have the same love for his neighbour as for himself, is much more than all forms of offerings. \n 12:34 [hgb] 耶 稣 见 他 回 答 的 有 智 慧 ， 就 对 他 说 ， 你 离 神 的 国 不 远 了 。 从 此 以 后 ， 没 有 人 敢 再 问 他 什 么 。 \n [kjv] And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question. \n [bbe] And when Jesus saw that he gave a wise answer, he said to him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. And every man after that was in fear of questioning him any more. \n 12:35 [hgb] 耶 稣 在 殿 里 教 训 人 ， 就 问 他 们 说 ， 文 士 怎 么 说 ， 基 督 是 大 卫 的 子 孙 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David? \n [bbe] And Jesus, when he was teaching in the Temple, said, How do the scribes say that the Christ is the Son of David? \n 12:36 [hgb] 大 卫 被 圣 灵 感 动 说 ， 主 对 我 主 说 ， 你 坐 在 我 的 右 边 ， 等 我 使 你 仇 敌 作 你 的 脚 凳 。 \n [kjv] For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool. \n [bbe] David himself said in the Holy Spirit, The Lord said to my Lord, Be seated at my right hand, till I put those who are against you under your feet. \n 12:37 [hgb] 大 卫 既 自 己 称 他 为 主 ， 他 怎 么 又 是 大 卫 的 子 孙 呢 ？ 众 人 都 喜 欢 听 他 。 \n [kjv] David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly. \n [bbe] David himself gives him the name of Lord; and how then is he his son? And the common people gave ear to him gladly. \n 12:38 [hgb] 耶 稣 在 教 训 之 间 ， 说 ， 你 们 要 防 备 文 士 ， 他 们 好 穿 长 衣 游 行 ， 喜 爱 人 在 街 市 上 问 他 们 的 安 ， \n [kjv] And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces, \n [bbe] And in his teaching he said, Be on your watch against the scribes, whose pleasure it is to go about in long robes and be respected in the market-places, \n 12:39 [hgb] 又 喜 爱 会 堂 里 的 高 位 筵 席 上 的 首 座 。 \n [kjv] And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts: \n [bbe] And to have the chief seats in the Synagogues and the first places at feasts; \n 12:40 [hgb] 他 们 侵 吞 寡 妇 的 家 产 ， 假 意 作 很 长 的 祷 告 。 这 些 人 要 受 更 重 的 刑 罚 。 \n [kjv] Which devour widows\u0027 houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation. \n [bbe] Who take away the property of widows, and before the eyes of men make long prayers; these will be judged more hardly. \n 12:41 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 银 库 坐 着 ， 看 众 人 怎 样 投 钱 入 库 。 有 好 些 财 主 ， 往 里 投 了 若 干 的 钱 。 \n [kjv] And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much. \n [bbe] And he took a seat by the place where the money was kept, and saw how the people put money into the boxes: and a number who had wealth put in much. \n 12:42 [hgb] 有 一 个 穷 寡 妇 来 ， 往 里 投 了 两 个 小 钱 ， 就 是 一 个 大 钱 。 \n [kjv] And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing. \n [bbe] And there came a poor widow, and she put in two little bits of money, which make a farthing. \n 12:43 [hgb] 耶 稣 叫 门 徒 来 ， 说 ， 我 实 在 告 诉 你 们 ， 这 穷 寡 妇 投 入 库 里 的 ， 比 众 人 所 投 的 更 多 。 \n [kjv] And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury: \n [bbe] And he made his disciples come to him, and said to them, Truly I say to you, This poor widow has put in more than all those who are putting money into the box: \n 12:44 [hgb] 因 为 他 们 都 是 自 己 有 余 ， 拿 出 来 投 在 里 头 。 但 这 寡 妇 是 自 己 不 足 ， 把 她 一 切 养 生 的 都 投 上 了 。 \n [kjv] For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living. \n [bbe] Because they all put in something out of what they had no need for; but she out of her need put in all she had, even all her living. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/156/2159.html","bookId":102,"book":{"id":102,"title":"马可福音 Mark","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 神 的 儿 子 ， 耶 稣 基 督 福 音 的 起 头 ， [kjv] The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God; [bbe] The first words of the ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/156","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
