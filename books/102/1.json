\\n\\n 1:3 [hgb] 在 旷 野 有 人 声 喊 着 说 ， 预 备 主 的 道 ， 修 直 他 的 路 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. \\n\\n [bbe] The voice of one crying in the waste land, Make ready the way of the Lord, make his roads straight; \\n\\n 1:4 [hgb] 照 这 话 ， 约 翰 来 了 ， 在 旷 野 施 洗 ， 传 悔 改 的 洗 礼 ， 使 罪 得 赦 。 \\n\\n [kjv] John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. \\n\\n [bbe] John came, and gave baptism in the waste land, preaching baptism as a sign of forgiveness of sin for those whose hearts were changed. \\n\\n 1:5 [hgb] 犹 太 全 地 ， 和 耶 路 撒 冷 的 人 ， 都 出 去 到 约 翰 那 里 ， 承 认 他 们 的 罪 ， 在 约 但 河 里 受 他 的 洗 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins. \\n\\n [bbe] And there went out to him all the people of Judaea, and all those of Jerusalem, and they were given baptism by him in the river Jordan, saying that they were sinners. \\n\\n 1:6 [hgb] 约 翰 穿 骆 驼 毛 的 衣 服 ， 腰 束 皮 带 ， 吃 的 是 蝗 虫 野 蜜 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And John was clothed with camel\u0027s hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey; \\n\\n [bbe] And John was clothed in camel\u0027s hair, with a leather band about him; and his food was locusts and honey. \\n\\n 1:7 [hgb] 他 传 道 说 ， 有 一 位 在 我 以 后 来 的 ， 能 力 比 我 更 大 ， 我 就 是 弯 腰 给 他 解 鞋 带 ， 也 是 不 配 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said to them all, There is one coming after me who is greater than I, whose shoes I am not good enough to undo. \\n\\n 1:8 [hgb] 我 是 用 水 给 你 们 施 洗 ， 他 却 要 用 圣 灵 给 你 们 施 洗 。 \\n\\n [kjv] I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost. \\n\\n [bbe] I have given you baptism with water, but he will give you baptism with the Holy Spirit. \\n\\n 1:9 [hgb] 那 时 ， 耶 稣 从 加 利 利 的 拿 撒 勒 来 ， 在 约 但 河 里 受 了 约 翰 的 洗 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. \\n\\n [bbe] And it came about in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was given baptism by John in the Jordan. \\n\\n 1:10 [hgb] 他 从 水 里 一 上 来 ， 就 看 见 天 裂 开 了 ， 圣 灵 仿 佛 鸽 子 ， 降 在 他 身 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him: \\n\\n [bbe] And straight away, coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens broken open and the Spirit coming down on him as a dove: \\n\\n 1:11 [hgb] 又 有 声 音 从 天 上 来 说 ， 你 是 我 的 爱 子 ， 我 喜 悦 你 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. \\n\\n [bbe] And a voice came out of heaven, You are my dearly loved Son, with whom I am well pleased. \\n\\n 1:12 [hgb] 圣 灵 就 把 耶 稣 催 到 旷 野 里 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness. \\n\\n [bbe] And straight away the Spirit sent him out into the waste land. \\n\\n 1:13 [hgb] 他 在 旷 野 四 十 天 受 撒 但 的 试 探 。 并 与 野 兽 同 在 一 处 。 且 有 天 使 来 伺 候 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him. \\n\\n [bbe] And he was in the waste land for forty days, being tested by Satan; and he was with the beasts; and the angels took care of him. \\n\\n 1:14 [hgb] 约 翰 下 监 以 后 ， 耶 稣 来 到 加 利 利 ， 宣 传 神 的 福 音 ， \\n\\n [kjv] Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, \\n\\n [bbe] Now after John had been put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the good news of God, \\n\\n 1:15 [hgb] 说 ， 日 期 满 了 ， 神 的 国 近 了 。 你 们 当 悔 改 ， 信 福 音 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel. \\n\\n [bbe] And saying, The time has come, and the kingdom of God is near: let your hearts be turned from sin and have faith in the good news. \\n\\n 1:16 [hgb] 耶 稣 顺 着 加 利 利 的 海 边 走 ， 看 见 西 门 ， 和 西 门 的 兄 弟 安 得 烈 ， 在 海 里 撒 网 。 他 们 本 是 打 鱼 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. \\n\\n [bbe] And going by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon, and Andrew, the brother of Simon, putting a net into the sea: for they were fishermen. \\n\\n 1:17 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 来 跟 从 我 ， 我 要 叫 你 们 得 人 如 得 鱼 一 样 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jesus said to them, Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men. \\n\\n 1:18 [hgb] 他 们 就 立 刻 舍 了 网 ， 跟 从 了 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him. \\n\\n [bbe] And they went straight from their nets, and came after him. \\n\\n 1:19 [hgb] 耶 稣 稍 往 前 走 ， 又 见 西 庇 太 的 儿 子 雅 各 ， 和 雅 各 的 兄 弟 约 翰 ， 在 船 上 补 网 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets. \\n\\n [bbe] And going on a little farther, he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were in their boat stitching up their nets. \\n\\n 1:20 [hgb] 耶 稣 随 即 招 呼 他 们 。 他 们 就 把 父 亲 西 庇 太 ， 和 雇 工 人 留 在 船 上 ， 跟 从 耶 稣 去 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said, Come after me: and they went away from their father Zebedee, who was in the boat with the servants, and came after him. \\n\\n 1:21 [hgb] 到 了 迦 百 农 ， 耶 稣 就 在 安 息 日 进 了 会 堂 教 训 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught. \\n\\n [bbe] And they came to Capernaum; and on the Sabbath he went into the Synagogue and gave teaching. \\n\\n 1:22 [hgb] 众 人 很 希 奇 他 的 教 训 。 因 为 他 教 训 他 们 ， 正 像 有 权 柄 的 人 ， 不 像 文 士 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes. \\n\\n [bbe] And they were full of wonder at his teaching, because he gave it as one having authority, and not like the scribes. \\n\\n 1:23 [hgb] 在 会 堂 里 有 一 个 人 ， 被 污 鬼 附 着 。 他 喊 叫 说 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, \\n\\n [bbe] And there was in their Synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he gave a cry, \\n\\n 1:24 [hgb] 拿 撒 勒 人 耶 稣 ， 我 们 与 你 有 什 么 相 干 ， 你 来 灭 我 们 吗 ？ 我 知 道 你 是 谁 ， 乃 是 神 的 圣 者 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God. \\n\\n [bbe] Saying, What have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? have you come to put an end to us? I see well who you are, the Holy One of God. \\n\\n 1:25 [hgb] 耶 稣 责 备 他 说 ， 不 要 作 声 ， 从 这 人 身 上 出 来 吧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jesus said to him sharply, Be quiet, and come out of him. \\n\\n 1:26 [hgb] 污 鬼 叫 那 人 抽 了 一 阵 疯 ， 大 声 喊 叫 ， 就 出 来 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him. \\n\\n [bbe] And the unclean spirit, shaking him violently, and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. \\n\\n 1:27 [hgb] 众 人 都 惊 讶 ， 以 致 彼 此 对 问 说 ， 这 是 什 么 事 ， 是 个 新 道 理 阿 。 他 用 权 柄 吩 咐 污 鬼 ， 连 污 鬼 也 听 从 了 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him. \\n\\n [bbe] And they were all greatly surprised, so that they put questions to one another, saying, What is this? a new teaching! with authority he gives orders even to the unclean spirits, and they do what he says. \\n\\n 1:28 [hgb] 耶 稣 的 名 声 ， 就 传 遍 了 加 利 利 的 四 方 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee. \\n\\n [bbe] And news of him went out quickly everywhere into all parts of Galilee round about. \\n\\n 1:29 [hgb] 他 们 一 出 会 堂 ， 就 同 着 雅 各 约 翰 ， 进 了 西 门 和 安 得 烈 的 家 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. \\n\\n [bbe] And when they came out of the Synagogue, they went into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. \\n\\n 1:30 [hgb] 西 门 的 岳 母 ， 正 害 热 病 躺 着 。 就 有 人 告 诉 耶 稣 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But Simon\u0027s wife\u0027s mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her. \\n\\n [bbe] Now Simon\u0027s wife\u0027s mother was ill, with a burning heat; and they gave him word of her: \\n\\n 1:31 [hgb] 耶 稣 进 前 拉 着 她 的 手 ， 扶 她 起 来 ， 热 就 退 了 ， 她 就 服 事 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them. \\n\\n [bbe] And he came and took her by the hand, lifting her up; and she became well, and took care of their needs. \\n\\n 1:32 [hgb] 天 晚 日 落 的 时 候 ， 有 人 带 着 一 切 害 病 的 ， 和 被 鬼 附 的 ， 来 到 耶 稣 跟 前 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils. \\n\\n [bbe] And in the evening, at sundown, they took to him all who were diseased, and those who had evil spirits. \\n\\n 1:33 [hgb] 合 城 的 人 都 聚 集 在 门 前 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And all the city was gathered together at the door. \\n\\n [bbe] And all the town had come together at the door. \\n\\n 1:34 [hgb] 耶 稣 治 好 了 许 多 害 各 样 病 的 人 ， 又 赶 出 许 多 鬼 ， 不 许 鬼 说 话 ， 因 为 鬼 认 识 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him. \\n\\n [bbe] And a number, who were ill with different diseases, he made well, and sent out evil spirits; but he did not let the evil spirits say anything, because they had knowledge of him. \\n\\n 1:35 [hgb] 次 日 早 晨 ， 天 未 亮 的 时 候 ， 耶 稣 起 来 ， 到 旷 野 地 方 去 ， 在 那 里 祷 告 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed. \\n\\n [bbe] And in the morning, a long time before daylight, he got up and went out to a quiet place, and there he gave himself up to prayer. \\n\\n 1:36 [hgb] 西 门 和 同 伴 追 了 他 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Simon and they that were with him followed after him. \\n\\n [bbe] And Simon and those who were with him came after him. \\n\\n 1:37 [hgb] 遇 见 了 就 对 他 说 ， 众 人 都 找 你 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee. \\n\\n [bbe] And when they came up with him, they said to him, Everyone is looking for you. \\n\\n 1:38 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 我 们 可 以 往 别 处 去 ， 到 邻 近 的 乡 村 ， 我 也 好 在 那 里 传 道 。 因 为 我 是 为 这 事 出 来 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said to them, Let us go to other parts into the nearest towns, so that I may give teaching there, because for this purpose I came. \\n\\n 1:39 [hgb] 于 是 在 加 利 利 全 地 ， 进 了 会 堂 ， 传 道 赶 鬼 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils. \\n\\n [bbe] And he went into their Synagogues in every part of Galilee, preaching and driving out evil spirits. \\n\\n 1:40 [hgb] 有 一 个 长 大 麻 疯 的 ， 来 求 耶 稣 ， 向 他 跪 下 说 ， 你 若 肯 ， 必 能 叫 我 洁 净 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. \\n\\n [bbe] And a leper came to him and, going down on his knees before him, made a request, saying, If it is your pleasure, you have the power to make me clean. \\n\\n 1:41 [hgb] 耶 稣 动 了 慈 心 ， 就 伸 手 摸 他 ， 说 ， 我 肯 ， 你 洁 净 了 吧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean. \\n\\n [bbe] And being moved with pity, he put out his hand, and touching him said to him, It is my pleasure; be made clean. \\n\\n 1:42 [hgb] 大 麻 疯 即 时 离 开 他 ， 他 就 洁 净 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed. \\n\\n [bbe] And straight away the disease went from him, and he was made clean. \\n\\n 1:43 [hgb] 耶 稣 严 严 地 嘱 咐 他 ， 就 打 发 他 走 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away; \\n\\n [bbe] And he sent him away, saying to him very sharply, \\n\\n 1:44 [hgb] 对 他 说 ， 你 要 谨 慎 ， 什 么 话 都 不 可 告 诉 人 。 只 要 去 把 身 体 给 祭 司 察 看 ， 又 因 为 你 洁 净 了 ， 献 上 摩 西 所 吩 咐 的 礼 物 ， 对 众 人 作 证 据 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. \\n\\n [bbe] See that you say nothing to any man: but go and let the priest see you, and make yourself clean by an offering of the things ordered by Moses, for a witness to them. \\n\\n 1:45 [hgb] 那 人 出 去 ， 倒 说 许 多 的 话 ， 把 这 件 事 传 扬 开 了 ， 叫 耶 稣 以 后 不 得 再 明 明 地 进 城 ， 只 好 在 外 边 旷 野 地 方 。 人 从 各 处 都 就 了 他 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter. \\n\\n [bbe] But he went out, and made it public, giving an account of it everywhere, so that Jesus was no longer able to go openly into a town, but was outside in the waste land; and they came to him from every part. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/156/2148.html","bookId":102,"book":{"id":102,"title":"马可福音 Mark","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 神 的 儿 子 ， 耶 稣 基 督 福 音 的 起 头 ， [kjv] The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;
