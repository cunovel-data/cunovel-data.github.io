{"id":2543,"no":9,"title":"Chapter 9","content":"9:1 [hgb] 耶 稣 又 对 他 们 说 ， 我 实 在 告 诉 你 们 ， 站 在 这 里 的 ， 有 人 在 没 尝 死 味 以 前 ， 必 要 看 见 神 的 国 大 有 能 力 临 到 。 [kjv] And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power. [bbe] And he said to them, Truly I say to you, There are some here who will have no taste of death till they see the kingdom of God come with power. 9:2 [hgb] 过 了 六 天 ， 耶 稣 带 着 彼 得 ， 雅 各 ， 约 翰 ， 暗 暗 地 上 了 高 山 ， 就 在 他 们 面 前 变 了 形 像 。 [kjv] And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them. [bbe] And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, and made them go up with him into a high mountain by themselves: and he was changed in form before them: 9:3 [hgb] 衣 服 放 光 ， 极 其 洁 白 。 地 上 漂 布 的 ， 没 有 一 个 能 漂 得 那 样 白 。 [kjv] And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them. [bbe] And his clothing became shining, very white, as no cleaner on earth would make it. 9:4 [hgb] 忽 然 有 以 利 亚 同 摩 西 向 他 们 显 现 。 并 且 和 耶 稣 说 话 。 [kjv] And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus. [bbe] And there came before them Elijah with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus. 9:5 [hgb] 彼 得 对 耶 稣 说 ， 拉 比 ， （ 拉 比 就 是 夫 子 ） 我 们 在 这 里 真 好 。 可 以 搭 三 座 棚 ， 一 座 为 你 ， 一 座 为 摩 西 ， 一 座 为 以 利 亚 。 [kjv] And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. [bbe] And Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tents; one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah. 9:6 [hgb] 彼 得 不 知 道 说 什 么 才 好 。 因 为 他 们 甚 是 惧 怕 ， [kjv] For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid. [bbe] Because he was not certain what to say, for they were in great fear. 9:7 [hgb] 有 一 朵 云 彩 来 遮 盖 他 们 。 也 有 声 音 从 云 彩 里 出 来 说 ， 这 是 我 的 爱 子 ， 你 们 要 听 他 。 [kjv] And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him. [bbe] And a cloud came over them; and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my dearly loved Son, give ear to him. 9:8 [hgb] 门 徒 忽 然 周 围 一 看 ， 不 再 见 一 人 ， 只 见 耶 稣 同 他 们 在 那 里 。 [kjv] And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves. [bbe] And suddenly looking round about, they saw no one any longer, but Jesus only with themselves. 9:9 [hgb] 下 山 的 时 候 ， 耶 稣 嘱 咐 他 们 说 ， 人 子 还 没 有 从 死 里 复 活 ， 你 们 不 要 将 所 看 见 的 告 诉 人 。 [kjv] And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead. [bbe] And while they were coming down from the mountain, he gave them orders not to give word to any man of the things they had seen, till the Son of man had come back from the dead. 9:10 [hgb] 门 徒 将 这 话 存 记 在 心 ， 彼 此 议 论 从 死 里 复 活 是 什 么 意 思 。 [kjv] And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean. [bbe] And they kept the saying, questioning among themselves what the coming back from the dead might be. 9:11 [hgb] 他 们 就 问 耶 稣 说 ， 文 士 为 什 么 说 ， 以 利 亚 必 须 先 来 。 [kjv] And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come? [bbe] And they put a question to him, saying, Why do the scribes say that Elijah has to come first? 9:12 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 以 利 亚 固 然 先 来 ， 复 兴 万 事 。 经 上 不 是 指 着 人 子 说 ， 他 要 受 许 多 的 苦 ， 被 人 轻 慢 呢 ？ [kjv] And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought. [bbe] And he said to them, Truly, Elijah does come first, and puts all things in order; and how is it said in the Writings that the Son of man will go through much sorrow and be made as nothing? 9:13 [hgb] 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 以 利 亚 已 经 来 了 ， 他 们 也 任 意 待 他 ， 正 如 经 上 所 指 着 他 的 话 。 [kjv] But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him. [bbe] But I say to you that Elijah has come, and they have done to him whatever they were pleased to do, even as the Writings say about him. 9:14 [hgb] 耶 稣 到 了 门 徒 那 里 ， 看 见 有 许 多 人 围 着 他 们 ， 又 有 文 士 和 他 们 辩 论 。 [kjv] And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them. [bbe] And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great mass of people about them, and scribes questioning them. 9:15 [hgb] 众 人 一 见 耶 稣 ， 都 甚 希 奇 ， 就 跑 上 去 问 他 的 安 。 [kjv] And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him. [bbe] And straight away all the people, when they saw him, were full of wonder, and running to him, gave him worship. 9:16 [hgb] 耶 稣 问 他 们 说 ， 你 们 和 他 们 辩 论 的 是 什 么 。 [kjv] And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them? [bbe] And he said, What are you questioning them about? 9:17 [hgb] 众 人 中 间 有 一 个 人 回 答 说 ， 夫 子 ， 我 带 了 我 的 儿 子 到 你 这 里 来 ， 他 被 哑 巴 鬼 附 着 。 [kjv] And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit; [bbe] And one of the number said to him in answer, Master, I came to you with my son, who has in him a spirit which takes away his power of talking; 9:18 [hgb] 无 论 在 哪 里 ， 鬼 捉 弄 他 ， 把 他 摔 倒 ， 他 就 口 中 流 沫 ， 咬 牙 切 齿 ， 身 体 枯 干 ， 我 请 过 你 的 门 徒 把 鬼 赶 出 去 ， 他 们 却 是 不 能 。 [kjv] And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not. [bbe] And wherever it takes him, it puts him down violently, streaming at the lips and twisted with pain; and his strength goes from him; and I made a request to your disciples to send it out, and they were not able. 9:19 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 嗳 ， 不 信 的 世 代 阿 ， 我 在 你 们 这 里 要 到 几 时 呢 ？ 我 忍 耐 你 们 要 到 几 时 呢 ？ 把 他 带 到 我 这 里 来 吧 。 [kjv] He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me. [bbe] And he said to them in answer, O generation without faith, how long will I have to be with you? how long will I put up with you? let him come to me. 9:20 [hgb] 他 们 就 带 了 他 来 。 他 一 见 耶 稣 ， 鬼 便 叫 他 重 重 地 抽 疯 。 倒 在 地 上 ， 翻 来 覆 去 ， 口 中 流 沫 。 [kjv] And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming. [bbe] And they took him to him: and when he saw him, the spirit in him straight away became violent; and he went down on the earth, rolling about and streaming at the lips. 9:21 [hgb] 耶 稣 问 他 父 亲 说 ， 他 得 这 病 ， 有 多 少 日 子 呢 ？ 回 答 说 ， 从 小 的 时 候 。 [kjv] And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him? And he said, Of a child. [bbe] And Jesus questioning the father said, How long has he been like this? And he said, From a child. 9:22 [hgb] 鬼 屡 次 把 他 扔 在 火 里 ， 水 里 ， 要 灭 他 。 你 若 能 作 什 么 ， 求 你 怜 悯 我 们 ， 帮 助 我 们 。 [kjv] And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us. [bbe] And frequently it has sent him into the fire and into the water, for his destruction; but if you are able to do anything, have pity on us, and give us help. 9:23 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 说 ， 你 若 能 信 ， 在 信 的 人 ， 凡 事 都 能 。 [kjv] Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth. [bbe] And Jesus said to him, If you are able! All things are possible to him who has faith. 9:24 [hgb] 孩 子 的 父 亲 立 时 喊 着 说 ， 我 信 。 但 我 信 不 足 ， 求 主 帮 助 。 （ 有 古 卷 作 立 时 流 泪 地 喊 着 说 ） [kjv] And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief. [bbe] Straight away the father of the child gave a cry, saying, I have faith; make my feeble faith stronger. 9:25 [hgb] 耶 稣 看 见 众 人 都 跑 上 来 ， 就 斥 责 那 污 鬼 ， 说 ， 你 这 聋 哑 的 鬼 ， 我 吩 咐 你 从 他 里 头 出 来 ， 再 不 要 进 去 。 [kjv] When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him. [bbe] And when Jesus saw that the people came running together, he gave orders to the unclean spirit, saying to him, You, spirit, who are the cause of his loss of voice and hearing, I say to you, come out of him, and never again go into him. 9:26 [hgb] 那 鬼 喊 叫 ， 使 孩 子 大 大 地 抽 了 一 阵 疯 ， 就 出 来 了 。 孩 子 好 像 死 了 一 般 ， 以 致 众 人 多 半 说 ， 他 是 死 了 。 [kjv] And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead. [bbe] And after crying out and shaking him violently, it came out: and the child became like one dead; so that most of them said, He is dead. 9:27 [hgb] 但 耶 稣 拉 着 他 的 手 ， 扶 他 起 来 ， 他 就 站 起 来 了 。 [kjv] But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose. [bbe] But Jesus took him by the hand, lifting him up; and he got up. 9:28 [hgb] 耶 稣 进 了 屋 子 ， 门 徒 就 暗 暗 地 问 他 说 ， 我 们 为 什 么 不 能 赶 出 他 去 呢 ？ [kjv] And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out? [bbe] And when he had gone into the house, his disciples said to him privately, Why were we unable to send it out? 9:29 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 非 用 祷 告 ， （ 有 古 卷 在 此 有 禁 食 二 字 ） 这 一 类 的 鬼 ， 总 不 能 出 来 。 （ 或 作 不 能 赶 他 出 来 ） [kjv] And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting. [bbe] And he said to them, Nothing will make this sort come out but prayer. 9:30 [hgb] 他 们 离 开 那 地 方 ， 经 过 加 利 利 。 耶 稣 不 愿 意 人 知 道 。 [kjv] And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it. [bbe] And they went out from there, through Galilee; and it was his desire that no man might have knowledge of it; 9:31 [hgb] 于 是 教 训 门 徒 ， 说 ， 人 子 将 要 被 交 在 人 手 里 ， 他 们 要 杀 害 他 。 被 杀 以 后 ， 过 三 天 他 要 复 活 。 [kjv] For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day. [bbe] For he was giving his disciples teaching, and saying to them, The Son of man is given up into the hands of men, and they will put him to death; and when he is dead, after three days he will come back from the dead. 9:32 [hgb] 门 徒 却 不 明 白 这 话 ， 又 不 敢 问 他 。 [kjv] But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him. [bbe] But the saying was not clear to them, and they were in fear of questioning him about it. 9:33 [hgb] 他 们 来 到 迦 百 农 。 耶 稣 在 屋 里 问 门 徒 说 ， 你 们 在 路 上 议 论 的 是 什 么 。 [kjv] And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way? [bbe] And they came to Capernaum: and when he was in the house, he put the question to them, What were you talking about on the way? 9:34 [hgb] 门 徒 不 作 声 ， 因 为 他 们 在 路 上 彼 此 争 论 谁 为 大 。 [kjv] But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest. [bbe] But they said nothing: because they had had an argument between themselves on the way, about who was the greatest. 9:35 [hgb] 耶 稣 坐 下 ， 叫 十 二 个 门 徒 来 ， 说 ， 若 有 人 愿 意 作 首 先 的 ， 他 必 作 众 人 末 后 的 ， 作 众 人 的 用 人 。 [kjv] And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all. [bbe] And seating himself, he made the twelve come to him; and he said to them, If any man has the desire to be first, he will be last of all and servant of all. 9:36 [hgb] 于 是 领 过 一 个 小 孩 子 来 ， 叫 他 站 在 门 徒 中 间 。 又 抱 起 他 来 ， 对 他 们 说 ， [kjv] And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them, [bbe] And he took a little child, and put him in the middle of them; and taking him in his arms, he said to them, 9:37 [hgb] 凡 为 我 名 ， 接 待 一 个 像 这 小 孩 子 的 就 是 接 待 我 。 凡 接 待 我 的 ， 不 是 接 待 我 ， 乃 是 接 待 那 差 我 来 的 。 [kjv] Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me. [bbe] Whoever will give honour to one such little child in my name, gives honour to me: and whoever gives honour to me, gives honour not to me, but to him who sent me. 9:38 [hgb] 约 翰 对 耶 稣 说 ， 夫 子 ， 我 们 看 见 一 个 人 ， 奉 你 的 名 赶 鬼 ， 我 们 就 禁 止 他 ， 因 为 他 不 跟 从 我 们 。 [kjv] And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us. [bbe] John said to him, Master, we saw one driving out evil spirits in your name: and we said that he might not, because he is not one of us. 9:39 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 不 要 禁 止 他 。 因 为 没 有 人 奉 我 名 行 异 能 ， 反 倒 轻 易 毁 谤 我 。 [kjv] But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me. [bbe] But Jesus said, Say not so: for there is no man who will do a great work in my name, and be able at the same time to say evil of me. 9:40 [hgb] 不 敌 挡 我 们 的 ， 就 是 帮 助 我 们 的 。 [kjv] For he that is not against us is on our part. [bbe] He who is not against us is for us. 9:41 [hgb] 凡 因 你 们 是 属 基 督 ， 给 你 们 一 杯 水 喝 的 ， 我 实 在 告 诉 你 们 ， 他 不 能 不 得 赏 赐 。 [kjv] For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward. [bbe] Whoever gives you a cup of water, because you are Christ\u0027s, truly I say to you, he will in no way be without his reward. 9:42 [hgb] 凡 使 这 信 我 的 一 个 小 子 跌 倒 的 ， 倒 不 如 把 大 磨 石 拴 在 这 人 的 颈 项 上 ， 扔 在 海 里 。 [kjv] And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea. [bbe] And whoever is a cause of trouble to one of these little ones who have faith in me, it would be better for him if a great stone was put round his neck and he was dropped into the sea. 9:43 [hgb] 倘 若 你 一 只 手 叫 你 跌 倒 ， 就 把 它 砍 下 来 。 [kjv] And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched: [bbe] And if your hand is a cause of trouble to you, let it be cut off; it is better for you to go into life with one hand than to have two hands and go into hell, into the eternal fire. 9:44 [hgb] 你 缺 了 肢 体 进 入 永 生 ， 强 如 有 两 只 手 落 到 地 狱 ， 入 那 不 灭 的 火 里 去 。 [kjv] Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. [bbe] [] 9:45 [hgb] 倘 若 你 一 只 脚 叫 你 跌 倒 ， 就 把 它 砍 下 来 。 [kjv] And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched: [bbe] And if your foot is a cause of trouble to you, let it be cut off: it is better for you to go into life with one foot than to have two feet and go into hell. 9:46 [hgb] 你 瘸 腿 进 入 永 生 ， 强 如 有 两 只 脚 被 丢 在 地 狱 里 。 [kjv] Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. [bbe] [] 9:47 [hgb] 倘 若 你 一 只 眼 叫 你 跌 倒 ， 就 去 掉 它 。 你 只 有 一 只 眼 进 入 神 的 国 ， 强 如 有 两 只 眼 被 丢 在 地 狱 里 。 [kjv] And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire: [bbe] And if your eye is a cause of trouble to you, take it out: it is better for you to go into the kingdom of God with one eye than, having two eyes, to go into hell, 9:48 [hgb] 在 那 里 虫 是 不 死 的 ， 火 是 不 灭 的 。 [kjv] Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. [bbe] Where their worm is ever living and the fire is not put out. 9:49 [hgb] 因 为 必 用 火 当 盐 ， 腌 各 人 。 （ 有 古 卷 在 此 有 凡 祭 物 必 用 盐 腌 ） [kjv] For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt. [bbe] Everyone will be salted with fire. 9:50 [hgb] 盐 本 是 好 的 ， 若 失 了 味 ， 可 用 什 么 叫 它 再 咸 呢 ？ 你 们 里 头 应 当 有 盐 ， 彼 此 和 睦 。 [kjv] Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another. [bbe] Salt is good; but if the taste goes from it, how will you make it salt again? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace one with another.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/156/2156.html","bookId":102,"book":{"id":102,"title":"马可福音 Mark","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 神 的 儿 子 ， 耶 稣 基 督 福 音 的 起 头 ， [kjv] The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God; [bbe] The first words of the ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/156","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
