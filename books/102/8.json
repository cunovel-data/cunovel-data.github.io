{"id":2542,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"8:1 [hgb] 那 时 ， 又 有 许 多 人 聚 集 ， 并 没 有 什 么 吃 的 。 耶 稣 叫 门 徒 来 ， 说 ， [kjv] In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them, [bbe] In those days again, when there was a great mass of people and they had no food, he made his disciples come to him and said to them, 8:2 [hgb] 我 怜 悯 这 众 人 ， 因 为 他 们 同 我 在 这 里 已 经 三 天 ， 也 没 有 吃 的 了 。 [kjv] I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat: [bbe] I have pity for these people because they have been with me now three days, and have no food; 8:3 [hgb] 我 若 打 发 他 们 饿 着 回 家 ， 就 必 在 路 上 困 乏 。 因 为 其 中 有 从 远 处 来 的 。 [kjv] And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far. [bbe] If I send them away to their houses with no food, they will be overcome by weariness on the way; and some of them have come from far. 8:4 [hgb] 门 徒 回 答 说 ， 在 这 野 地 ， 从 哪 里 能 得 饼 ， 叫 这 些 人 吃 饱 呢 ？ [kjv] And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness? [bbe] And his disciples said in answer, How will it be possible to get enough bread for these men here in a waste place? 8:5 [hgb] 耶 稣 问 他 们 说 ， 你 们 有 多 少 饼 ？ 他 们 说 ， 七 个 。 [kjv] And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven. [bbe] And he put the question, How much bread have you? And they said, Seven cakes. 8:6 [hgb] 他 吩 咐 众 人 坐 在 地 上 ， 就 拿 着 这 七 个 饼 ， 祝 谢 了 ， 掰 开 递 给 门 徒 叫 他 们 摆 开 ， 门 徒 就 摆 在 众 人 面 前 。 [kjv] And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people. [bbe] And he made the people be seated on the earth: and he took the seven cakes and, having given praise, he gave the broken bread to his disciples to put before them; and they put it before the people. 8:7 [hgb] 又 有 几 条 小 鱼 。 耶 稣 祝 了 福 ， 就 吩 咐 也 摆 在 众 人 面 前 。 [kjv] And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before them. [bbe] And they had some small fishes; and blessing them he had them put before the people in the same way. 8:8 [hgb] 众 人 都 吃 ， 并 且 吃 饱 了 。 收 拾 剩 下 的 零 碎 ， 有 七 筐 子 。 [kjv] So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets. [bbe] And they took the food, and had enough; and they took up seven baskets full of the broken bits. 8:9 [hgb] 人 数 约 有 四 千 。 耶 稣 打 发 他 们 走 了 ， [kjv] And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away. [bbe] And there were about four thousand people: and he sent them away. 8:10 [hgb] 随 即 同 门 徒 上 船 ， 来 到 大 玛 努 他 境 内 。 [kjv] And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha. [bbe] And he got into the boat with his disciples straight away, and came into the country of Dalmanutha. 8:11 [hgb] 法 利 赛 人 出 来 盘 问 耶 稣 ， 求 他 从 天 上 显 个 神 迹 给 他 们 看 ， 想 要 试 探 他 。 [kjv] And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him. [bbe] And the Pharisees came out and put questions to him, requesting from him a sign from heaven, testing him. 8:12 [hgb] 耶 稣 心 里 深 深 地 叹 息 说 ， 这 世 代 为 什 么 求 神 迹 呢 ？ 我 实 在 告 诉 你 们 ， 没 有 神 迹 给 这 世 代 看 。 [kjv] And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation. [bbe] And he was very sad in spirit, and said, Why is this generation looking for a sign? truly, I say to you, No sign will be given to this generation. 8:13 [hgb] 他 就 离 开 他 们 ， 又 上 船 往 海 那 边 去 了 。 [kjv] And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side. [bbe] And he went away from them, and again got into the boat and went across to the other side. 8:14 [hgb] 门 徒 忘 了 带 饼 。 在 船 上 除 了 一 个 饼 ， 没 有 别 的 食 物 。 [kjv] Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf. [bbe] And they had taken no thought to get bread; and they had only one cake of bread with them in the boat. 8:15 [hgb] 耶 稣 嘱 咐 他 们 说 ， 你 们 要 谨 慎 ， 防 备 法 利 赛 人 的 酵 ， 和 希 律 的 酵 。 [kjv] And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod. [bbe] And he said to them, Take care to be on the watch against the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod. 8:16 [hgb] 他 们 彼 此 议 论 说 ， 这 是 因 为 我 们 没 有 饼 吧 。 [kjv] And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread. [bbe] And they said to one another, We have no bread. 8:17 [hgb] 耶 稣 看 出 来 ， 就 说 ， 你 们 为 什 么 因 为 没 有 饼 就 议 论 呢 ？ 你 们 还 不 省 悟 ， 还 不 明 白 吗 ？ 你 们 的 心 还 是 愚 顽 吗 ？ [kjv] And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened? [bbe] And Jesus, hearing it, said to them, Why are you reasoning among yourselves because you have no bread? do you still not see, and is it still not clear to you? are your hearts so hard? 8:18 [hgb] 你 们 有 眼 睛 看 不 见 吗 ？ 有 耳 朵 ， 听 不 见 吗 ？ 也 不 记 得 吗 ？ [kjv] Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember? [bbe] Having eyes, do you not see? and having ears, have you no hearing? and have you no memory? 8:19 [hgb] 我 掰 开 那 五 个 饼 分 给 五 千 人 ， 你 们 收 拾 的 零 碎 ， 装 满 了 多 少 篮 子 呢 ？ 他 们 说 ， 十 二 个 。 [kjv] When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve. [bbe] When I made a division of the five cakes of bread among the five thousand, what number of baskets full of broken bits did you take up? They said to him, Twelve. 8:20 [hgb] 又 掰 开 那 七 个 饼 分 给 四 千 人 ， 你 们 收 拾 的 零 碎 ， 装 满 了 多 少 筐 子 呢 ？ 他 们 说 ， 七 个 。 [kjv] And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven. [bbe] And when the seven among the four thousand, what number of baskets full of broken bits did you take up? And they said to him, Seven. 8:21 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 你 们 还 是 不 明 白 吗 ？ [kjv] And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand? [bbe] And he said to them, Is it still not clear to you? 8:22 [hgb] 他 们 来 到 伯 赛 大 ， 有 人 带 一 个 瞎 子 来 ， 求 耶 稣 摸 他 。 [kjv] And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him. [bbe] And they came to Beth-saida. And they took a blind man to him, requesting him to put his hands on him. 8:23 [hgb] 耶 稣 拉 着 瞎 子 的 手 ， 领 他 到 村 外 。 就 吐 唾 沫 在 他 眼 睛 上 ， 按 手 在 他 身 上 ， 问 他 说 ， 你 看 见 什 么 了 。 [kjv] And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought. [bbe] And he took the blind man by the hand, and went with him out of the town; and when he had put water from his mouth on his eyes, and put his hands on him, he said, Do you see anything? 8:24 [hgb] 他 就 抬 头 一 看 说 ， 我 看 见 人 了 。 他 们 好 像 树 木 ， 并 且 行 走 。 [kjv] And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking. [bbe] And looking up, he said, I see men; I see them like trees, walking. 8:25 [hgb] 随 后 又 按 手 在 他 眼 睛 上 ， 他 定 睛 一 看 ， 就 复 了 原 ， 样 样 都 看 得 清 楚 了 。 [kjv] After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly. [bbe] Then again he put his hands on his eyes; and looking hard, he was able to see, and saw all things clearly. 8:26 [hgb] 耶 稣 打 发 他 回 家 ， 说 ， 连 这 村 子 你 也 不 要 进 去 。 [kjv] And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town. [bbe] And he sent him away to his house, saying, Do not even go into the town. 8:27 [hgb] 耶 稣 和 门 徒 出 去 ， 往 该 撒 利 亚 腓 立 比 的 村 庄 去 。 在 路 上 问 门 徒 说 ， 人 说 我 是 谁 。 [kjv] And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am? [bbe] And Jesus went out, with his disciples, into the little towns round Caesarea Philippi; and on the way he put a question to his disciples, saying, Who do men say that I am? 8:28 [hgb] 他 们 说 ， 有 人 说 ， 是 施 洗 的 约 翰 。 有 人 说 ， 是 以 利 亚 。 又 有 人 说 ， 是 先 知 里 的 一 位 。 [kjv] And they answered, John the Baptist: but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets. [bbe] And they made answer, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but others, One of the prophets. 8:29 [hgb] 又 问 他 们 说 ， 你 们 说 我 是 谁 。 彼 得 回 答 说 ， 你 是 基 督 。 [kjv] And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ. [bbe] And he said to them, But who do you say I am? Peter said in answer, You are the Christ. 8:30 [hgb] 耶 稣 就 禁 戒 他 们 ， 不 要 告 诉 人 。 [kjv] And he charged them that they should tell no man of him. [bbe] And he put them under orders not to say this of him to anyone. 8:31 [hgb] 从 此 他 教 训 他 们 说 ， 人 子 必 须 受 许 多 的 苦 ， 被 长 老 祭 司 长 和 文 士 弃 绝 ， 并 且 被 杀 ， 过 三 天 复 活 。 [kjv] And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. [bbe] And teaching them, he said that the Son of man would have to undergo much, and be hated by those in authority, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be put to death, and after three days come back from the dead. 8:32 [hgb] 耶 稣 明 明 地 说 这 话 ， 彼 得 就 拉 着 他 ， 劝 他 。 [kjv] And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him. [bbe] And he said this openly. And Peter took him, and was protesting. 8:33 [hgb] 耶 稣 转 过 来 ， 看 着 门 徒 ， 就 责 备 彼 得 说 ， 撒 但 ， 退 我 后 边 去 吧 。 因 为 你 不 体 贴 神 的 意 思 ， 只 体 贴 人 的 意 思 。 [kjv] But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men. [bbe] But he, turning about, and seeing his disciples, said sharply to Peter, Get out of my way, Satan: for your mind is not on the things of God, but on the things of men. 8:34 [hgb] 于 是 叫 众 人 和 门 徒 来 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 若 有 人 要 跟 从 我 ， 就 当 舍 己 ， 背 起 他 的 十 字 架 来 跟 从 我 。 [kjv] And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. [bbe] And turning to the mass of people with his disciples, he said to them, If any man has the desire to come after me, let him give up all other desires, and take up his cross and come after me. 8:35 [hgb] 因 为 凡 要 救 自 己 生 命 的 ， （ 生 命 或 作 灵 魂 下 同 ） 必 丧 掉 生 命 。 凡 为 我 和 福 音 丧 掉 生 命 的 ， 必 救 了 生 命 。 [kjv] For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel\u0027s, the same shall save it. [bbe] Whoever has a desire to keep his life, will have it taken from him; and whoever gives up his life because of me and the good news, will keep it. 8:36 [hgb] 人 就 是 赚 得 全 世 界 ， 赔 上 自 己 的 生 命 ， 有 什 么 益 处 呢 ？ [kjv] For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? [bbe] What profit has a man if he gets all the world with the loss of his life? 8:37 [hgb] 人 还 能 拿 什 么 换 生 命 呢 ？ [kjv] Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? [bbe] And what would a man give in exchange for his life? 8:38 [hgb] 凡 在 这 淫 乱 罪 恶 的 世 代 ， 把 我 和 我 的 道 当 作 可 耻 的 ， 人 子 在 他 父 的 荣 耀 里 ， 同 圣 天 使 降 临 的 时 候 ， 也 要 把 那 人 当 作 可 耻 的 。 [kjv] Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels. [bbe] Whoever has a feeling of shame because of me and my words in this false and evil generation, the Son of man will have a feeling of shame because of him, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/156/2155.html","bookId":102,"book":{"id":102,"title":"马可福音 Mark","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 神 的 儿 子 ， 耶 稣 基 督 福 音 的 起 头 ， [kjv] The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God; [bbe] The first words of the ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/156","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
