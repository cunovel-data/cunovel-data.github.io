{"id":5547,"no":10,"title":"Chapter 10","content":"10:1 [hgb] 死 苍 蝇 ， 使 作 香 的 膏 油 发 出 臭 气 。 这 样 ， 一 点 愚 昧 ， 也 能 败 坏 智 慧 和 尊 荣 。 [kjv] Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour. [bbe] Dead flies make the oil of the perfumer give out an evil smell; more valued is a little wisdom than the great glory of the foolish. 10:2 [hgb] 智 慧 人 的 心 居 右 。 愚 昧 人 的 心 居 左 。 [kjv] A wise man\u0027s heart is at his right hand; but a fool\u0027s heart at his left. [bbe] The heart of the wise man goes in the right direction; but the heart of a foolish man in the wrong. 10:3 [hgb] 并 且 愚 昧 人 行 路 ， 显 出 无 知 。 对 众 人 说 ， 他 是 愚 昧 人 。 [kjv] Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool. [bbe] And when the foolish man is walking in the way, he has no sense and lets everyone see that he is foolish. 10:4 [hgb] 掌 权 者 的 心 ， 若 向 你 发 怒 ， 不 要 离 开 你 的 本 位 ， 因 为 柔 和 能 免 大 过 。 [kjv] If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences. [bbe] If the wrath of the ruler is against you, keep in your place; in him who keeps quiet even great sins may be overlooked. 10:5 [hgb] 我 见 日 光 之 下 ， 有 一 件 祸 患 ， 似 乎 出 于 掌 权 的 错 误 ， [kjv] There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceedeth from the ruler: [bbe] There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, like an error which comes by chance from a ruler: 10:6 [hgb] 就 是 愚 昧 人 立 在 高 位 。 富 足 人 坐 在 低 位 。 [kjv] Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place. [bbe] The foolish are placed in high positions, but men of wealth are kept low. 10:7 [hgb] 我 见 过 仆 人 骑 马 ， 王 子 像 仆 人 在 地 上 步 行 。 [kjv] I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth. [bbe] I have seen servants on horses, and rulers walking on the earth as servants. 10:8 [hgb] 挖 陷 坑 的 ， 自 己 必 掉 在 其 中 。 拆 墙 垣 的 ， 必 为 蛇 所 咬 。 [kjv] He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him. [bbe] He who makes a hole for others will himself go into it, and for him who makes a hole through a wall the bite of a snake will be a punishment. 10:9 [hgb] 凿 开 （ 或 作 挪 移 ） 石 头 的 ， 必 受 损 伤 。 劈 开 木 头 的 ， 必 遭 危 险 。 [kjv] Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby. [bbe] He who gets out stones from the earth will be damaged by them, and in the cutting of wood there is danger. 10:10 [hgb] 铁 器 钝 了 ， 若 不 将 刃 磨 快 ， 就 必 多 费 气 力 。 但 得 智 慧 指 教 ， 便 有 益 处 。 [kjv] If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct. [bbe] If the iron has no edge, and he does not make it sharp, then he has to put out more strength; but wisdom makes things go well. 10:11 [hgb] 未 行 法 术 以 先 ， 蛇 若 咬 人 ， 后 行 法 术 也 是 无 益 。 [kjv] Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better. [bbe] If a snake gives a bite before the word of power is said, then there is no longer any use in the word of power. 10:12 [hgb] 智 慧 人 的 口 ， 说 出 恩 言 。 愚 昧 人 的 嘴 ， 吞 灭 自 己 。 [kjv] The words of a wise man\u0027s mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself. [bbe] The words of a wise man\u0027s mouth are sweet to all, but the lips of a foolish man are his destruction. 10:13 [hgb] 他 口 中 的 言 语 ， 起 头 是 愚 昧 。 他 话 的 末 尾 ， 是 奸 恶 的 狂 妄 。 [kjv] The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous madness. [bbe] The first words of his mouth are foolish, and the end of his talk is evil crime. 10:14 [hgb] 愚 昧 人 多 有 言 语 ， 人 却 不 知 将 来 有 什 么 事 。 他 身 后 的 事 ， 谁 能 告 诉 他 呢 ？ [kjv] A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him? [bbe] The foolish are full of words; man has no knowledge of what will be; and who is able to say what will be after him? 10:15 [hgb] 凡 愚 昧 人 ， 他 的 劳 碌 使 自 己 困 乏 。 因 为 连 进 城 的 路 他 也 不 知 道 。 [kjv] The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city. [bbe] The work of the foolish will be a weariness to him, because he has no knowledge of the way to the town. 10:16 [hgb] 邦 国 阿 ， 你 的 王 若 是 孩 童 ， 你 的 群 臣 早 晨 宴 乐 ， 你 就 有 祸 了 。 [kjv] Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning! [bbe] Unhappy is the land whose king is a boy, and whose rulers are feasting in the morning. 10:17 [hgb] 邦 国 阿 ， 你 的 王 若 是 贵 胄 之 子 ， 你 的 群 臣 按 时 吃 喝 ， 为 要 补 力 ， 不 为 酒 醉 ， 你 就 有 福 了 。 [kjv] Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness! [bbe] Happy is the land whose ruler is of noble birth, and whose chiefs take food at the right time, for strength and not for feasting. 10:18 [hgb] 因 人 懒 惰 ， 房 顶 塌 下 。 因 人 手 懒 ， 房 屋 滴 漏 。 [kjv] By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through. [bbe] When no work is done the roof goes in, and when the hands do nothing water comes into the house. 10:19 [hgb] 设 摆 筵 席 ， 是 为 喜 笑 。 酒 能 使 人 快 活 ， 钱 能 叫 万 事 应 心 。 [kjv] A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all things. [bbe] A feast is for laughing, and wine makes glad the heart; but by the one and the other money is wasted. 10:20 [hgb] 你 不 可 咒 诅 君 王 ， 也 不 可 心 怀 此 念 。 在 你 卧 房 也 不 可 咒 诅 富 户 。 因 为 空 中 的 鸟 ， 必 传 扬 这 声 音 。 有 翅 膀 的 ， 也 必 述 说 这 事 。 [kjv] Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter. [bbe] Say not a curse against the king, even in your thoughts; and even secretly say not a curse against the man of wealth; because a bird of the air will take the voice, and that which has wings will give news of it.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/120/1804.html","bookId":181,"book":{"id":181,"title":"传道书 Ecclesiastes","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 在 耶 路 撒 冷 作 王 ， 大 卫 的 儿 子 ， 传 道 者 的 言 语 。 [kjv] The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
