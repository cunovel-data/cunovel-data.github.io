{"id":86657,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"Looking at them together is a slap in the face. The girl he\u0027d obviously already spent time with tonight is really pretty. She\u0027s got big brown eyes, perfect blonde hair, and a waist so small it\u0027s a wonder all her internal organs can fit inside her body. Maybe they\u0027re all stuffed into her huge boobs instead. \"No, I\u0027m not kidding,\" I tell her, finding my voice again. \"Caleb, come back to our suite.\" He looks confused. \"Your shirt is still in my room,\" the girl says with a big grin. She probably expects him to blow me off, and she\u0027s probably right. To my surprise, Caleb slings an arm over my shoulder. He smells like beer. \"I gotta go with her.\" I can detect a slight slur in his speech, confirming that he\u0027s not completely sober. The girl ducks back in her room, but reappears a second later. She whips his shirt at him. \"You\u0027re a loser,\" she says, and then looks at me. \"You can have him.\" When she slams the door, it\u0027s just Caleb and me standing in the hall. I shrug off his arm. He hasn\u0027t put his shirt back on and his zipper is still undone. \"Are you coming?\" I ask impatiently. I\u0027m kind of surprised that he follows me back to our suite. I unlock the door. \"I need help,\" Caleb slurs as he drapes his arm across my shoulders again. I can feel the heat of his bare skin through my clothes. In the past I would have done anything for Caleb to put his arm around me. But not now. \"You have beer breath,\" I tell him, pushing him off me. \"And if you want help zipping up your fly, you\u0027ve asked the wrong girl.\" He stumbles into the suite behind me and collapses on the couch. \"So you\u0027re the wrong girl for me but the right girl for Matt?\" he asks. \"Shut up, Caleb. Matt\u0027s just a friend.\" \"I don\u0027t think so. I think you\u0027ve moved on to him.\" \"My relationships are none of your business. And just because I talk to a guy doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027ve moved on to him.\" \"Right. I knew that.\" He looks around, confused. \"Wait, where\u0027s the rest of our little dysfunctional group?\" \"At a movie.\" \"Why aren\u0027t you with \u0027em?\" As if on cue, a sharp pain starts at my ankle and shoots up my calf. I would suck in a breath, but I don\u0027t want Caleb feeling sorry for me. \"I need to rest my leg.\" He pats the cushion next to him. \"Take a load off and sit next to me.\" Caleb\u0027s hair is sticking up in all different directions and that damn zipper is still open as a reminder of what he was doing with that girl tonight. Problem is, he still looks good. My top lip curls, thinking about him and that other girl. \"No.\" \"Come on, just for a second.\" His eyes are at half-mast and he\u0027s attempting to act all vulnerable and innocent, but I know better. \"You should probably go to bed before Damon catches you drunk or on drugs or whatever you ingested tonight,\" I tell him. \"Sit with me for a minute, then I\u0027ll disappear into my room and you won\u0027t have to see me for the rest of the night. I promise.\" He fumbles with his fly and finally zips and buttons his pants, then leans his head against the back of the couch. \"And just so you know, I didn\u0027t do drugs. Could\u0027ve, but didn\u0027t. Don\u0027t want to end up like my mom,\" he mumbles. That\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve heard him talk about his family since this trip started. I hear a distinct sadness in his voice when he mentions his mom, which makes him seem even more vulnerable. I stand right in front of him, determined to be the rational one. \"You were drinking tonight. Don\u0027t deny it.\" His lips curve into a small smile. \"Yeah, I drank. Feels good to not have to think about ... everything.\" I hesitate. Being close to Caleb isn\u0027t a good idea. \"I should report you to Damon.\" \"Yeah, you should.\" I sigh. \"But I won\u0027t.\" \"Why not, Mags? Could it be that deep down in that frozen heart of yours you still like me?\" He reaches out and pulls me toward him. Not being very steady in the first place, I stumble forward, but he cradles my body with his arm and gently lowers me to the couch until I\u0027m lying down. Under him. \"Don\u0027t answer that question,\" he says. My brain tells me to scramble away and keep my distance, but my body isn\u0027t listening to my brain. My body has a mind of its own. I look up into Caleb\u0027s intense, sea blue eyes. Those depths are totally focused on my lips, reminding me of the first time we kissed back in Paradise. It was at Paradise Park, right after he held me while I cried in his arms. I swear the air grows thicker around us, closing in like a dark cloud. All I hear is the sound of our breathing. I forget everything else and let myself enjoy being this close to him again. He brushes my hair away from my face with unexpected gentleness, the pads of his fingers a soft caress brushing across my cheek. I bunch my hands at my sides, afraid that if I actually move I\u0027ll slip back into reality. Caleb shifts and moves closer. \"Maggie, do you want this as much as I do?\" he asks, his face poised right above mine. \"I ... I can\u0027t answer that.\" He leans back just the slightest bit, but he\u0027s still close enough I can smell the alcohol he drank tonight. \"Why not?\" he asks. I move my hand to his bare chest to stop him before I lose all common sense. Having him this close makes me breathe harder and my pulse race, which just makes me even angrier with myself than with him. \"Do you really have to ask? You were obviously with another girl tonight, Caleb. I\u0027m not degrading myself by being sloppy seconds.\" \"I didn\u0027t kiss her. I swear.\" When I give him an I-don\u0027t-believe-you look, his expression turns gravely serious. \"I\u0027m not gonna say we didn\u0027t fool around, but I couldn\u0027t go through with it \u0027cause I was...\" He squeezes his eyes shut. After a second he opens his eyes and stares right into mine with that serious look again. \"Forget it.\" \"Just go to bed,\" I tell him, trying to push him off of me. \"It\u0027s obvious you\u0027re drunk and aren\u0027t thinking straight.\" \"Kiss me, then I\u0027ll go to bed.\" \"You\u0027re crazy,\" I choke. \"Yeah, I know.\" His lips are twisted into a half smile. \"But humor me just this once.\" His head slowly dips toward mine. I watch and hold my breath as his beautiful, full lips get closer and closer. \"Oh Maggie,\" he murmurs softly when I instinctively wrap my arms around his neck. \"I need this.\" I must not be thinking clearly, because I say against his lips, \"Me too.\" His hands are braced on either side of my head as he brushes his lips over mine. We kiss tentatively, as if we\u0027re both not sure it\u0027s okay. My heart is slowly melting. My entire body tingles with excitement and anticipation as one of his hands grabs my waist and pulls me closer. I close my eyes and pretend we\u0027re back in Mrs. Reynolds\u0027 gazebo when it was just the two of us. It felt so good; it couldn\u0027t have been wrong. Back then he held me and made me believe that as long as we were together, everything else would fall into place. I sigh into Caleb\u0027s open mouth; it comes out as a little whimper. He leans away from me. I open my eyes and find him smiling-a one-hundred-percent-satisfied male smile. As if my response is his cue to take this further, Caleb gives a guttural growl right before he lowers his head again. His mouth is on mine, open, his tongue searching. I think my brain is trying to send off warning signals, but my body and my own tongue are enjoying the attention too much to listen. The sounds of our tongues and lips and moans spur me on, and I find myself raking my hands through his hair, pulling him closer. \"Touch me,\" Caleb urges as he reaches out and traces my lips with the soft tip of his finger and dips it into my mouth. I convince myself to think of the gazebo. As long as I keep my eyes closed, we\u0027re there-we\u0027re in the past and not the present. He\u0027s going to tell me how much he cares about me any minute now. He\u0027s going to tell me that I\u0027m the only girl he wants and needs. He traces a wet path down my neck and dips his finger into my the V of my T-shirt. His mouth follows with little kisses before he moves up and kisses me again. I start to sweat with passion. I\u0027m on fire. It\u0027s all slow and erotic, our tongues reaching out and gliding and searching as if we\u0027re both savoring the taste of each other. The bitter taste of beer has been replaced by this sweet scent that reminds me solely of Caleb. I\u0027m lost in the present, but my mind and body are stuck in the past. It feels good and oh, so right to be finally kissing him like this. And touching him. He said he needs this. I wasn\u0027t lying when I admitted I needed it, too. When he reaches under my shirt and rubs his thumb across the top of my bra, the rest of his hand cradling my breast, I feel like the world has stopped and it\u0027s just the two of us left. I feel a warm sensation running from my breast to the tips of my toes and back again. My insides are slowly melting into little puddles. Until my cell phone rings. It\u0027s in my purse, ringing loudly and interrupting my fantasy. \"Don\u0027t answer it,\" Caleb rasps. \"Ignore it.\" He kisses me again, but the gazebo is gone. The moment is lost. My cell phone keeps ringing. I turn my head, breaking the kiss, and blink a sudden tear of frustration away as I send my arm flailing for my purse. \"I can\u0027t.\" My hand finds the side pocket and I grab my cell. The number glowing on the Caller ID makes me suck in a breath. \"It\u0027s my dad,\" I say slowly as I nudge Caleb\u0027s hand away from under my shirt. I let the phone ring and ring until the call gets transferred to voicemail. My dad, the guy who calls me once or twice a year. My dad, who left me and barely looks back. I look up at Caleb, still poised above me. He\u0027s the boy who left and didn\u0027t look back until we were forced together on this trip. He betrayed me just like my dad did. He lied to me just like my dad did. He fooled around with another girl tonight, then moved on to me like it didn\u0027t matter. Different face, different body, same interchangeable good time. I\u0027m pathetic and the only one I can blame is me. I could have said no. I could have acted like I didn\u0027t want this. I could have walked into my bedroom and shut the door. But I didn\u0027t. Instead, I stepped closer to him ... almost testing him to see if he\u0027d make a move. Sure enough, he took the bait. I\u0027m no better than that girl he was with tonight. \"Caleb, what are we doing?\" I ask. He leans away from me to sit up again and sighs. \"Oh, no, here it comes. Your introspective, emotional, and philosophical self is coming out.\" \"Why shouldn\u0027t I be introspective? We don\u0027t make sense. \"Neither does chocolate and peanut butter, but somehow it works,\" he says. \"Somehow the mixture of those two things is genius.\" \"You\u0027re drunk. I\u0027m not talking about food. I\u0027m talking about two people with a really screwed-up past-\" \"Stop thinking so much,\" he says, finishing my sentence. \"No matter how much time has passed, it doesn\u0027t seem to matter.\" He rubs my arm gently, tickling my sensitive skin. \"I don\u0027t know why we\u0027re both fighting it so much. Hell, I couldn\u0027t do it with Brandi tonight because all I could think about was you. I even called her your name,\" he says, rambling. \"Yeah, it\u0027s screwed up, we\u0027re screwed up, but why hide the fact that we still want each other?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/return-to-paradise-leaving-paradise-2/page-10.html","bookId":2772,"book":{"id":2772,"title":"Return to Paradise (Leaving Paradise #2)","description":"Storyline: Return to Paradise (Leaving Paradise #2) Caleb Becker left Paradise eight months ago, taking with him the secret he promised to take to his grave.
