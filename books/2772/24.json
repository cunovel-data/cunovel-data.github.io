{"id":86671,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"Matt motions us over.\\n\\n He shakes my hand when I reach their table. \"Caleb and Lenny, this is my girlfriend Becca and that\u0027s Robert, our physical therapist.\"\\n\\n Robert holds out his hand and shakes mine, then Lenny\u0027s. I give him a strong, hard shake so he knows I\u0027m not a dead fish. The guy is drinking beer, and he looks like he came out of a damn GQ magazine spread. Is that the kind of guy she\u0027s looking for, an older one who wears fancy clothes?\\n\\n \"What are you doing here?\" Maggie asks, totally confused.\\n\\n \"I came back.\"\\n\\n \"Have you seen Leah and your dad?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m staying with them.\" I pause. \"For now. Lenny had some issues with his mom, so he\u0027s staying at my house too.\\n\\n I\u0027m trying to read her, but I can\u0027t. The guy she\u0027s with seems amused that I\u0027m here. Has she told him about me? Does she even give a shit that I\u0027m back, or was all that talk about coming back to Paradise solely for my parents\u0027 and sister\u0027s sake?\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you guys join us?\" Robert asks.\\n\\n Nice way to shove it in my face, dude. He has no clue if he attempts to stick his tongue down Maggie\u0027s throat in my presence, I\u0027ll be on him like a pit bull. \"No, thanks.\"\\n\\n Lenny spots an empty booth across the way and heads over to it.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll talk later,\" I tell Maggie. I follow Lenny and slide into the booth.\\n\\n As if the night couldn\u0027t get worse, my old high school friends walk through the door. I spot my old best friend Brian Newcomb right away, the guy who was dating Kendra while I was still dating her. She was sleeping with both of us and I had no clue. Brian knew, but he was too chickenshit to tell me about it.\\n\\n He\u0027s with Tristan and Drew. The four of us were on the wrestling team together. We\u0027d hung out since grade school. After I was released from jail, Drew was a cocky asshole and Tristan\u0027s mom ordered me to stay away from him. Tristan didn\u0027t argue.\\n\\n I try not to make eye contact with the guys, and instead attempt to concentrate on whatever nonsense is flying out of Lenny\u0027s mouth. I think he\u0027s reminiscing about tossing Trish in the lake, but I\u0027m hardly listening, because out of the corner of my eye I see Brian walking toward us.\\n\\n \"Holy shit, it really is you,\" Brian says, leaning into the booth and slapping me on the back. \"Where you been, man?\"\\n\\n I try to fight off the feeling of camaraderie with Brian, but I can\u0027t. We were best friends for too damn long for me to turn my back and pretend he doesn\u0027t exist.\\n\\n \"I was in Chicago for a while,\" I tell him. Brian nods as if he understands. I gesture to Lenny. \"This is Lenny. Lenny, these are my old friends.\"\\n\\n \"Cool.\" Lenny nods at each of them.\\n\\n \"Hey, Caleb,\" Tristan says, shaking my hand. \"You\u0027re back, huh?\"\\n\\n \"Just for a little while,\" I tell him.\\n\\n Drew has a sly grin on his face as he sits on the bench beside me. \"Brian, give Caleb the good news.\"\\n\\n If Brian tells me he got a wrestling scholarship to Notre Dame, I won\u0027t be surprised. He always wanted to be one of the Fighting Irish, even though he\u0027s German. It was one of our running jokes. Brian is a smart guy, and worked hard to get the grades so he could get in.\\n\\n Brian shoves his hands in his pockets. \"Yeah, umm, I\u0027m getting married.\"\\n\\n \"To Kendra,\" Drew chimes in, as if he can\u0027t keep the salacious info off his tongue. Drew hates Kendra, but he loves gossip that\u0027s sure to ignite sparks between Brian and me.\\n\\n He\u0027s not going to get those sparks, at least from me.\\n\\n I reach past Drew and hold out my hand to Brian. \"Congrats, man,\" I say. And I mean it. I thought he\u0027d go the college route, but if this is what he wants, more power to him.\\n\\n Brian shakes my hand. \"Thanks, Caleb. That\u0027s really cool of you.\"\\n\\n I nod, and I\u0027m glad that\u0027s over. The ice is broken. Tristan slides in next to Lenny, and Brian pulls up a chair to sit on the end.\\n\\n This is one cozy little group.\\n\\n Speaking of cozy little groups ... I peer over at Maggie. She\u0027s having all sorts of fun with Matt, that guy Robert, and Becca. Okay, well not exactly fun. They\u0027re all just talking. I shouldn\u0027t give a shit. I don\u0027t give a shit.\\n\\n How old is that dude, anyway? He\u0027s got a sports coat on as if he\u0027s about to broadcast the five o\u0027clock news, and he\u0027s drinking his beer out of a glass instead of a bottle. The dude is a diva.\\n\\n \"So when\u0027s the wedding?\" Lenny asks Brian.\\n\\n \"In two weeks,\" Brian mumbles as the waitress comes over.\\n\\n After we order, Brian pulls out his cell phone and starts texting. For a guy who\u0027s getting married in two weeks, he doesn\u0027t look happy. In fact, he looks downright depressed.\\n\\n I wouldn\u0027t put it past Kendra to manipulate him into marrying her, except for the fact that ever since sophomore year, Kendra has been obsessed with leaving Paradise and moving to California. She always wanted to be an actress or model and used to make fun of the people who graduated from Paradise High and stayed here their entire lives. She called them white trash losers.\\n\\n Tristan tries to grab Brian\u0027s phone, but he pulls it out of his reach. \"Stop it,\" he orders.\\n\\n Our food comes, and I have to say thank God for Lenny. I don\u0027t feel like talking much, and Lenny can carry on a conversation about anything. When Lenny finds out Drew is into sports cars, he pulls all this random sports car knowledge out of his ass. Funny thing is, he sounds like he really knows what he\u0027s talking about.\\n\\n When Tristan mentions the new Frisbee course that went up at the south end of Paradise Park, Lenny says he \"loves frolfing\" and that \"technically it\u0027s called disc golfing because Frisbee is a brand name, yadda yadda.\"\\n\\n Who knew Lenny was an encyclopedia of useless information? I\u0027m just glad I don\u0027t have to carry the conversation, especially because I keep looking over at Maggie.\\n\\n Oh, shit. I catch her looking back. Our eyes lock on one another.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got to go,\" Brian says.\\n\\n \"Sit down, Bri,\" Drew says. \"I drove you, remember? I\u0027m not goin\u0027 anywhere until I finish my food.\"\\n\\n Brian reaches into his wallet and tosses a ten dollar bill on the table. \"You don\u0027t have to interrupt your meal, Drew. Kendra is picking me up.\"\\n\\n Brian keeps looking at the door and holding his cell phone in his palm, as if he\u0027s expecting to be summoned by text any minute. Something\u0027s not right.\\n\\n Apparently Kendra decides to come in rather than just text him, because she walks through the door and heads toward us. Her big blue eyes are focused on me and her long blonde hair is perfectly styled. Her makeup makes her look hard, not like the pretty girl I started dating when we were sophomores. She was my first serious girlfriend, and the one who I lost my virginity to. I used to think she was the sexiest thing alive.\\n\\n \"I thought you were going to text me when you got here, Brian says. \"\\n\\n Kendra doesn\u0027t break her eye contact with me. \"I had to see if it was true.\" She wets her top lip and throws me one of her all-too-familiar sexy looks. \"So ... Caleb Becker is back. Again.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, Kend,\" I say. \"I hear congratulations are in order.\"\\n\\n She looks down at her ring finger and the small diamond. \"Thanks.\"\\n\\n \"You ready?\" Brian asks, taking her hand.\\n\\n Kendra removes her hand from Brian\u0027s grasp. \"Can I talk to CB outside for a minute?\"\\n\\n I haven\u0027t heard that nickname in a long time. CB, my initials. She always called me that.\\n\\n Brian looks at me, then back at her. \"Yeah, I guess so. But I thought you said we were late for the cake tasting.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s fine,\" is her response. \"I need to talk to Caleb first.\"\\n\\n Drew rolls his eyes, but slides out of the booth to let me out.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll be right back,\" Kendra tells Brian. \"Wait here.\"\\n\\n She heads for the exit, and doesn\u0027t stop until we\u0027re next to the gravel parking lot.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t believe you came back,\" she says.\\n\\n I tell her the truth. \"I needed to tie up some loose ends.\"\\n\\n \"Am I a loose end, CB? \u0027Cause I swear, all I\u0027ve done since you left is think about you and me. Do you think about me?\"\\n\\n I\u0027m confused. Why is she bringing us up when she was the one who cheated on me? \"Why are you marrying Brian? \u0027Cause neither one of you look happy about it. I know for a fact that after graduation you were dying to leave this town and go out to California, and Brian was dead set on going to Notre Dame.\"\\n\\n Kendra crosses her arms around her stomach. \"I\u0027m pregnant, Caleb.\"\\n\\n Shit. Pregnant? Didn\u0027t see that coming, although I guess the evidence is right in front of my face. Kendra isn\u0027t wearing one of her signature tight shirts that hug her body. She\u0027s wearing a loose shirt with a light jacket.\\n\\n Tears start welling in her eyes, making her eyelashes sparkle. When she blinks and black mascara falls down her cheek along with her tear, I don\u0027t know what to say.\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" I say dumbly.\\n\\n \"Brian doesn\u0027t even want to apply for college, Caleb. He wants to take over his dad\u0027s butcher shop. Can you imagine me staying in Paradise and being the wife of a butcher?\"\\n\\n She wraps her arms around my waist. I keep my hands off her, because damn it, I don\u0027t want Brian coming out here and thinking we\u0027re about to get it on. And I don\u0027t want Maggie seeing me with Kendra, either.\\n\\n It was a bad idea coming out here with her. I take her wrists and unwrap her arms from around my waist.\\n\\n \"Kend ... shit, why didn\u0027t you just use a condom or something? We were always careful.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, well the next time a guy says he\u0027ll promise to pull out I\u0027ll remember that\u0027s not effective birth control.\"\\n\\n She wraps her arms around me again. We dated for over two years, but she doesn\u0027t have a hold on me now.\\n\\n I also know that Kendra can turn the damsel-in-distress act into the diva-with-an-agenda act in a matter of seconds.\\n\\n She buries her head into my chest. \"Take me with you,\" I think I hear her say.\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n She looks up with wide blue eyes and blinks her long lashes.\\n\\n \"Take me back, CB,\" she says. \"I never stopped loving you.\\n\\n THIRTY\\n\\n Maggie\\n\\n saw Kendra and Caleb leave the restaurant together, but I didn\u0027t expect to find them in an intimate embrace in the parking lot. As we walk out of Dusty\u0027s, I can\u0027t help but stare.\\n\\n Kendra is looking up at Caleb. He\u0027s looking down at her.\\n\\n Suddenly, I don\u0027t feel good.\\n\\n If he bends his head further, they\u0027re going to kiss. I look down at the gravel. If he kisses her, I might have to hurl a rock at them.\\n\\n Stop it, Maggie.\\n\\n Okay, I need to get a grip. Caleb and I parted amicably. We\u0027re friends, above all else. And I\u0027m glad he\u0027s finally back in Paradise, because I know his family needs him.\\n\\n We get back to my house and hang out for a while, until Robert starts yawning and Matt drives him and Becca home. While I\u0027m saying good-bye to them, Kendra drives up in her little sports car and parks in front of Caleb\u0027s house. She tosses her blonde hair back with a flick of her wrist. The pieces fall in perfect waves down the side of her face and land in little curls at the bottom.\\n\\n She doesn\u0027t even look my way when she walks up to Caleb\u0027s door and rings his bell in all her sexy glory. I try not to pay attention as he opens the door and lets her in, but I can\u0027t help it. Old habits die hard.\\n\\n After Matt drives off with Robert and Becca, I have the urge to ring Caleb\u0027s doorbell and fight for him like Lou is fighting for my mom.\\n\\n Instead, I sit on our front steps and think. And wait. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/return-to-paradise-leaving-paradise-2/page-24.html","bookId":2772,"book":{"id":2772,"title":"Return to Paradise (Leaving Paradise #2)","description":"Storyline: Return to Paradise (Leaving Paradise #2) \\n Caleb Becker left Paradise eight months ago, taking with him the secret he promised to take to his grave.
