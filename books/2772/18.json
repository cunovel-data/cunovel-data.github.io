{"id":86665,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"\"No.\" I hold in my amusement as the next words fly out of my mouth. \"But hold your breath or you\u0027ll get a mouthful of lake water.\"\\n\\n Before she can ask why, I dunk us both. She tries pushing away from me as soon as we come up completely drenched a second later, but I hold onto her tight. I may be pissed at her, but I don\u0027t want her drowning from shock, or weighted down because she\u0027s wearing long pants.\\n\\n Maggie comes up sputtering, but not from lake water getting in her mouth. The girl is mad as hell. \"How ... could ... you!\"\\n\\n \"It was pretty easy, actually,\" I tell her, still holding her tight while she tries to push me away.\\n\\n She splashes my face.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t do that,\" I tell her.\\n\\n She does it again, so I let her go. She maneuvers to stand a few feet in front of me, her hands already underneath the water. She\u0027s definitely ready for a splash war. I play dirty, though, and splashing is a kids\u0027 game. We\u0027re not kids anymore.\\n\\n Maggie is about to get a dose of what it\u0027s like to play in the big leagues.\\n\\n I wade closer to her. She starts splashing, but I don\u0027t reciprocate. I\u0027m soaking wet, but I ignore the water hitting in my face and stinging my eyes. I just keep moving closer until I\u0027m close enough to reach out and grab her wrists so she can\u0027t splash me anymore.\\n\\n I hold her hands behind her back and pull her snugly against my body. She\u0027s so close I feel her breasts pressed against my bare chest. When she looks up at me, our lips are inches apart. Her hair is dripping wet, her face has droplets of water glistening from the sun reflecting on them, and her lips are shiny and wet.\\n\\n I don\u0027t know how I ever could have thought of this girl as plain.\\n\\n \"What are you gonna do now that I\u0027m helpless?\" she asks.\\n\\n I lean down and whisper in her ear, \"You\u0027ve got it all wrong, Maggie. I\u0027m the helpless one here.\"\\n\\n \"Oh,\" she says, eyes wide.\\n\\n I loosen my hold on her wrists while I slide my lips across her cheek. The sensation of her soft skin against my lips combined with her body still pressed against mine is driving me insane. Oh, hell. I don\u0027t want to want her. It would be so much easier to hate Maggie and ban her from my thoughts and my life. But Julio\u0027s words echo in my head: no regrets.\\n\\n When my lips reach the corner of her mouth, I let go of her arms and move my hands to her waist. At the same time, I lightly glide my lips across hers. She sighs and breathes faster as our wet lips slide ever so slowly back and forth, back and forth.\\n\\n It\u0027s erotic. Painfully erotic.\\n\\n I\u0027m not gonna deepen the kiss, that\u0027s her move. I\u0027m gonna make her want it so damn bad she\u0027d rather die than not feel my tongue sliding against hers. She\u0027s gotta want this even more than me.\\n\\n There\u0027s one problem here. My body is betraying me, big time. I\u0027m glad we\u0027re under water so the evidence of my arousal is hidden from view.\\n\\n When her hands reach up and sneak around my neck, I know I\u0027ve got the upper hand. She wants this. I\u0027m gonna make her beg for it and make out with her like there\u0027s no tomorrow. Then I\u0027ll walk away as if I don\u0027t give a shit.\\n\\n Cruel, yes. But I\u0027ve got to prove to her once and for all that I\u0027m a badass ex-con. Yesterday at the DOC, seeing Julio and the other inmates reminded me where I came from. Who I really am. Doesn\u0027t matter if I didn\u0027t hit Maggie and went to jail for my sister.\\n\\n I\u0027ll always be an ex-con. It\u0027s branded on me like an invisible tattoo. But I need to live each day like it\u0027s my last ... with no regrets.\\n\\n I hold back a groan as Maggie opens her lips and tilts her head. Her lips slant, slightly open, against mine. This is it. Finally. I\u0027m waiting impatiently for her tongue to snake out and reach mine. It\u0027s gonna happen any second. It\u0027s gotta happen, \u0027cause this is fucking torture. I know she\u0027s no stranger to French kissing. Hell, we did it back at the dorm and it was earth-shattering.\\n\\n I\u0027m ready. Damn, I\u0027m more than ready. My entire body is screaming of readiness. She\u0027s got to be ready for this, too.\\n\\n She opens her mouth wider and moans, a moan that makes me fantasize about what it would be like to witness her having an orgasm. I\u0027m so turned on I know I\u0027m gonna pay for it later.\\n\\n But that doesn\u0027t matter.\\n\\n I swallow a triumphant smile. Here it comes. That moan of hers was a clue that she\u0027s dying to take this to the next level. I wish my body wasn\u0027t ready to take this to the next three levels.\\n\\n She moans against my lips again, and my tongue is twitching in my mouth ready to be unleashed like a fucking caged animal. I\u0027m usually a patient kisser, but ...\\n\\n Still nothing.\\n\\n What the-\\n\\n I lean back. \"What the hell are you doing?\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\" she asks, innocently batting her eyelashes against the hot sun beaming down on us.\\n\\n Is she kidding me?\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s your tongue?\" I ask stupidly.\\n\\n Her wet little eyebrows furrow. \"In my mouth. Why, where\u0027s it supposed to be?\"\\n\\n I let go of her, step back and rub my hands through my soaked hair to get a handle on reality. \"You\u0027re fucking with me, right?\"\\n\\n She shrugs. The movement creates ripples around her body that move across the water. \"Maybe.\"\\n\\n Oh. No. She. Didn\u0027t.\\n\\n My tongue is unleashed now, but it\u0027s to argue not to kiss. \"You were trying to get me all hot and bothered to get back at me for dumping you in the water, weren\u0027t you? Admit it. You\u0027re not the innocent little Maggie you want everyone to think you are. You\u0027re a damn tease, that\u0027s what you are.\\n\\n \"And what were you doing, Caleb? Weren\u0027t you trying to get me all hot and bothered on purpose? You\u0027re the tease.\"\\n\\n \"You have no clue,\" I bark back. This lying bit can go both ways, sweetheart.\\n\\n Maggie starts wading toward shore.\\n\\n I\u0027m left here, all alone. Not how I thought this scenario would go down. \"So you\u0027re just gonna walk away?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" she calls out, her back to me. \"You were the one who said we needed to break things off until this trip was over. I\u0027m just following your rules.\"\\n\\n I wish I could follow her, but I need to stay waist-deep for at least another minute until my body cools down.\\n\\n \"I said we needed to cool it.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m cool,\" she says over her shoulder.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not.\" I\u0027m all hot and bothered. Being in the cool lake should help, but doesn\u0027t.\\n\\n Maggie one-upped me. My ego is busted, big time. But I manage to forget it for the time being and get out of the water. I lie on the beach and wonder if I need to try a different tactic.\\n\\n A half hour later, we all head into our little canoes with our fishing gear. None of the girls know how to put a worm on a hook, so each guy has to go with one of the girls.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going with Matt,\" Maggie declares up front. Matt is all too eager to accommodate her.\\n\\n In the end, I\u0027m stuck with Trish, because she says she\u0027s afraid Lenny will tip the boat on purpose.\\n\\n Lenny and poor Erin are paired up, and she looks like she\u0027s about to puke. She looks that way most of the time lately. I\u0027m starting to think she\u0027s either got a case of the flu or a case of pregnancy.\\n\\n \"So what\u0027s the real story with you and Maggie?\" Trish asks as we row out to the middle of the lake. \"It looks like you two are a couple again.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re not.\"\\n\\n Trish rolls her eyes. \"Oh, puh-lease. It\u0027s obvious you guys having something hot and heavy going on. Just spill the beans already so the rest of us don\u0027t have to speculate about it anymore.\"\\n\\n I laugh. \"What\u0027ve you speculated?\"\\n\\n \"That you\u0027re still in love with her.\" She hands me the worm container and her fishing pole. \"You want to know what I think?\"\\n\\n \"Not really. Why don\u0027t we talk about you and Lenny?\"\\n\\n \"What about me and Lenny?\" she asks, her face scrunched up like I\u0027m nuts.\\n\\n \"Admit you\u0027ve got a thing for him.\"\\n\\n \"Eww. Don\u0027t make me throw up, Caleb.\" I put the worm on the hook and Trish winces. \"How can you do that? It\u0027s inhumane.\"\\n\\n \"Think of it as feeding the fish.\"\\n\\n Trish folds her arms across her chest. \"Yeah, right. Feeding them, then sticking a hole in their face as punishment for wanting a little food.\"\\n\\n I hand the pole back to her, all ready to go. \"You want to fish, or not?\" I ask her as I notice Matt and Maggie across the way with their poles in the water. They\u0027re talking. I wonder if she\u0027s complaining about me.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s scared, you know,\" Trish says. \"She thinks you\u0027ll leave her again.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s probably right.\"\\n\\n \"Then let her go, Caleb. Stop confusing her and giving her mixed signals. She deserves a guy who\u0027ll stick around and be there when she needs him.\"\\n\\n \"Like Matt?\" I say harshly.\\n\\n Trish holds her hands up. \"Don\u0027t get all pissed off. I\u0027m just saying what I think.\"\\n\\n \"I think you should keep your opinions to yourself.\"\\n\\n Trish puts her fishing pole into the water and says with certainty, \"And I think you know I\u0027m right.\"\\n\\n TWENTY-TWO\\n\\n Maggie\\n\\n or the rest of the Re-START trip, Caleb keeps his distance. He acts like we\u0027re mere acquaintances. He only interacts with me when he has to. When we talk to groups around Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin, Caleb shares how he was arrested and how he\u0027d do anything to avoid jail in the future.\\n\\n He doesn\u0027t talk about going to jail for Leah. I think he wants to forget that part of the story, although in my opinion the reality of what he did for his sister looms over him every day. I wish I could get him to talk about it, but at this point he doesn\u0027t trust me at all.\\n\\n I\u0027m not sure he trusts anyone.\\n\\n It\u0027s the day before the end of the trip, and we\u0027re staying in a big rented cabin in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. The cabin has nine bedrooms, so we each get our own. But I can\u0027t sleep with the thought of losing Caleb again pressing on me. I peek into his room at two in the morning, but his bed is empty. My heart is panicking, thinking he\u0027s skipped out early.\\n\\n Relief washes over me as I spot Caleb from my window. He\u0027s skipping rocks by the lake.\\n\\n My brain tells me it will be better to just let him go.\\n\\n My heart ... not so much.\\n\\n I still want to convince him to go back to Paradise. I haven\u0027t done a great job of doing what I set out to do. Tonight is my last chance. Thinking about what Vanessa said, I brace myself to confront Caleb once and for all.\\n\\n I slip through the sliding glass door. The melodic sound of the crickets chirping follows in my wake as I walk down the gravel path to the lake.\\n\\n \"I guess this is good-bye ... again.\"\\n\\n He doesn\u0027t look at me. Instead, he skips another rock. \"I guess so. Have fun in Spain.\"\\n\\n I haven\u0027t thought about my impending year abroad for a few weeks now. This Re-START trip has been exhausting both physically and mentally. I\u0027ve learned a lot about myself this past month. I\u0027ve also become good friends with Trish and Erin, who are now like sisters. Trish thinks she\u0027s Erin\u0027s protector, and the three of us have spent most nights talking until the early morning hours.\\n\\n I sit on a big boulder and watch him. \"Where are you headed?\"\\n\\n He shrugs. \"Arizona, I think.\"\\n\\n Arizona? That\u0027s too far. There are so many loose ends he needs to tie up before he goes away. \"Come back to Paradise, Caleb.\"\\n\\n \"This conversation is over.\"\\n\\n I stand and step right in front of him. He\u0027s about to skip another rock, but I take his hand and open it up so the rock falls to the ground. \"Go back to Paradise,\" I say again.\\n\\n He lowers his gaze to the ground, and I feel his defeat as if it\u0027s my own. \"I can\u0027t. When I came back home, my entire family wanted me to pretend the Beckers were this picture-perfect family. In reality, each one of us was fucked up. I couldn\u0027t fake it before. I still can\u0027t, so don\u0027t even ask me to. I\u0027m living with so many regrets, I can\u0027t add another one to the roster.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/return-to-paradise-leaving-paradise-2/page-18.html","bookId":2772,"book":{"id":2772,"title":"Return to Paradise (Leaving Paradise #2)","description":"Storyline: Return to Paradise (Leaving Paradise #2) \\n Caleb Becker left Paradise eight months ago, taking with him the secret he promised to take to his grave.
