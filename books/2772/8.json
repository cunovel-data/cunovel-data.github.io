{"id":86655,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"Problem is, the night in the gazebo ended with me trying to ease Maggie\u0027s skirt up so I could see her scars. Maggie pushed my hand away. She didn\u0027t trust me. The night kind of went downhill from there.\\n\\n In the suite, Erin and Trish are in the lounge area. I peek into the girls\u0027 room. Having Maggie mad at me isn\u0027t my intention.\\n\\n Maggie is lying on one of the beds. Matt is sitting on the bed next to her. They\u0027re obviously in an intimate conversation, because they\u0027re alone and whispering. Oh, hell.\\n\\n I retreat and head back to the guys\u0027 room, glad they didn\u0027t catch me watching them. Lenny is sitting on his bed, wearing nothing but his skimpy briefs. He\u0027s holding a personal mini-fan up to his chest.\\n\\n \"You do know the girls can walk in here at any second, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n The door wasn\u0027t closed or locked. Trish and Erin are sitting right outside the door, and if they crane their necks they\u0027d probably have a good view of Lenny practically naked.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t give a shit, Caleb. I\u0027m fucking hot as hell.\" He proceeds to lift up the band of his briefs and faces the mini-fan toward his dick. \"My poor ball sacks are sweatin\u0027 so bad I swear I won\u0027t be able to have kids. My boys are being cooked to death in there.\"\\n\\n \"Might be a good thing. I\u0027m not sure you should be allowed to procreate anyway,\" I murmur as I turn away. I\u0027m glad Damon isn\u0027t making me go to dinner with the group, \u0027cause getting a glimpse of Lenny fanning his sweaty nuts made me lose my appetite.\\n\\n Seeing Maggie and Matt talking on her bed hasn\u0027t helped my appetite or mood, either.\\n\\n \"Just an FYI,\" Lenny says, his face still red from the nasty sunburn. \"I\u0027ve got a shitload of condoms in my duffle. Front pocket.\"\\n\\n \"For what?\"\\n\\n \"Listen, if you don\u0027t know what condoms are for I\u0027m not gonna teach you.\"\\n\\n \"I know what they\u0027re for, shithead. I just highly doubt you\u0027re getting any ass on this trip.\"\\n\\n \"Watch me,\" Lenny says. \"My boy gets action all the time.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I bet your right hand is tired from all that action,\" I mumble as I walk to the bathroom.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m a leftie!\" Lenny calls after me. I try not to wince from thinking about it.\\n\\n I take a quick shower to cool off, then change into jeans and a T-shirt. I don\u0027t have a chance to explain or apologize to Maggie, because she\u0027s too busy talking with Matt. Thing is, they deserve each other. Matt\u0027s a decent guy. I can\u0027t blame him for going for her. Maggie might not be the girl who stands out in a crowd or the one with a model\u0027s body, but once you get to know her, I mean really know her, you just see her ... a girl who wears her heart on her sleeve and is so genuine you\u0027re afraid every word out of your mouth will come out wrong. She\u0027s someone you don\u0027t have to worry will cheat on you, like my ex Kendra did. Maggie is-\\n\\n I\u0027ve got to stop thinking about her. It\u0027s like I\u0027m torturing myself for no reason except to piss myself off.\\n\\n After the group leaves for dinner and whatever additional festivities Damon has planned, I need some air. The suite is too hot even with the windows wide open.\\n\\n I walk through the tree-lined Freeman University campus, trying not to think about how I got here and what I\u0027ll be doing after this program is finished. I\u0027ve got nothing to look forward to.\\n\\n I walk past a bunch of guys playing football on the quad. The quarterback has no aim and the ball flies right in my direction.\\n\\n I catch it.\\n\\n \"Nice catch,\" one guy says. \"We could use another receiver. Wanna play?\"\\n\\n \"Sure,\" I say, shrugging.\\n\\n I join one of the teams and play with them until it\u0027s too dark to see the ball and one of the guys tells the others they\u0027re late for their own frat party.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s your name?\" the quarterback asks me as we walk off their makeshift field.\\n\\n \"Caleb.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m David. Listen, Caleb. My buddies and I are having a little get-together at our frat house. Come with us.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. Come on,\" one of the other guys says as he tosses the football in the air. \"It\u0027s the least we could do for having you help us kick Garrett\u0027s ass on the field today.\"\\n\\n \"That was suh-weet!\" the quarterback agrees, and they give each other an enthusiastic high-five.\\n\\n I follow the guys two blocks until we reach their fraternity house. It\u0027s impressive-a massive three-story house with four white columns in front. It looks like a damn mansion. A bunch of girls and guys are hanging on the front porch. Music blares from inside.\\n\\n As soon as I walk in with David and the other guys, I realize their little party isn\u0027t a little party. It\u0027s a big one, and it\u0027s in full swing.\\n\\n Before I know it, David shoves a red plastic cup in my hand. \"So, Caleb, you a freshman? Haven\u0027t seen you around FU before.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not really a student,\" I say, then take a sip of whatever\u0027s in the cup. Beer. Cold beer. I\u0027m sure Damon had some rule about drinking, but the alcohol tastes so good going down my throat that I\u0027m not about to toss it. The fact that I know the more I drink the more I\u0027ll stop thinking about Maggie and Matt sitting on her bed this afternoon deep in conversation is a bonus. \"I\u0027m staying in the dorms for a stupid program I got stuck on.\"\\n\\n \"I hate stupid programs,\" David says.\\n\\n \"Hey, Davie,\" says a blonde girl with a short skirt and low-cut top. She finishes off the beer in her plastic cup, and I get the distinct feeling she started partying way before us. \"Who\u0027s your hot friend?\"\\n\\n David drapes his arm on the girl\u0027s shoulders. \"Caleb, this is Brandi. She\u0027s one of our frat house neighbors and our resident babe. Brandi, show my man Caleb here a good time.\" He excuses himself with a wink to me.\\n\\n The girl looks me up and down, then flashes me a wide smile with a peek of tongue showing.\\n\\n \"Wanna dance?\" she asks.\\n\\n I finish what\u0027s left in my cup. \"Sure.\"\\n\\n She takes my hand and leads me to a crowded room off to the side. There\u0027s a keg and we both fill up our cups. Cup in hand, she starts moving her sexy body to the music. I hastily gulp my beer down and walk toward her. Our bodies grind together with the beat of the music, and one thought goes through my mind: tonight I need this girl.\\n\\n TEN\\n\\n Maggie\\n\\n here\u0027s Caleb?\" I ask Damon as we walk to the pizza place a few blocks away from the campus. He said a high school youth group is meeting us there, so their members can talk to us and hear our stories.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s gonna stay in tonight,\" Damon says. \"I think he needs time to cool off and think about why he\u0027s here.\"\\n\\n I sigh, knowing the truth of it all. \"He doesn\u0027t want to be a part of this group.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, well, he needs to be here nonetheless,\" Damon says as his cell rings. \"He just needs to get a grip on his emotions.\"\\n\\n As Damon takes the call, Matt is at my side. \"You okay?\" he asks.\\n\\n I nod. \"I\u0027m kind of glad Caleb isn\u0027t coming with us.\"\\n\\n \"Me too.\"\\n\\n I flash Matt a questioning look. \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"\u0027Cause you seem upset when he\u0027s around.\" He shrugs sheepishly. \"I don\u0027t like seeing you upset.\"\\n\\n I put my arm around Matt and smile up at him. \"Thanks for being a good friend,\" I say, leaning into his chest as we follow the others.\\n\\n He puts his arm around me. \"No prob.\"\\n\\n It\u0027s nice knowing I have Matt here. During physical therapy we\u0027d talk a bit, and complain about Robert, our physical therapist. Robert loves to push his patients to the limit whether they like it or not.\\n\\n \"Caleb\u0027s not such a bad guy,\" I tell him.\\n\\n \"I know,\" Matt says. \"Caleb\u0027s cool. All of us have screwed-up shit we have to work out. Caleb just seems to have sunk deeper than we have.\"\\n\\n \"You seem to be handling your problems better than most of us on this trip,\" I tell him.\\n\\n \"I fake it. Truth is, I\u0027m glad I\u0027m here, but I\u0027ve got to admit that some of those kids last night looked at me like I was a complete moron.\" He pauses, then adds, \"Then again, I was a complete moron, but it\u0027s like going through it all over again. I wonder if I\u0027ll ever get used to the looks and the stares.\"\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t,\" I admit to him. \"At first I was super selfconscious whenever I\u0027d walk into a room ... I noticed all eyes on me. I still get the pity stares, which might be worse than your moron stares.\"\\n\\n \"Come on, Maggie. We both have obvious disabilities, unlike the rest on this trip. And we\u0027re both trying to get over our past relationships.\"\\n\\n Matt stops and lets the others go ahead of us. \"Can you imagine us as a couple?\" he asks me.\\n\\n I\u0027m not sure if he\u0027s wondering how people would react to seeing a limping girl and one-armed boy together, or if he really is wondering if I could imagine dating him.\\n\\n I\u0027ve never thought about it before.\\n\\n Matt\u0027s sweet.\\n\\n He\u0027s cute.\\n\\n He\u0027s a good guy.\\n\\n But ...\\n\\n \"That was rhetorical question, wasn\u0027t it?\" I ask.\\n\\n He brushes a stray hair from my face and tucks it behind my ear. \"Maybe. Then again, maybe not.\"\\n\\n He leans down and I know he\u0027s going to kiss me. I should do it, if for no other reason than to give Matt a chance and prove to myself that I\u0027m open to being with someone besides Caleb.\\n\\n His lips meet mine and he wraps his arm around me. It\u0027s not passionate and hot like Caleb\u0027s kisses, but it\u0027s nice and safe and warm and ...\\n\\n I pull away. \"I can\u0027t.\"\\n\\n Matt looks sad. \"Maybe we\u0027re not ready to move on after all.\"\\n\\n My cell phone in my purse starts ringing. I don\u0027t know if Matt is right or wrong. I like Matt ... I\u0027ve always liked Matt. He\u0027s a great guy that any girl should be proud to date.\\n\\n So why couldn\u0027t I kiss Matt without thinking about Caleb?\\n\\n My phone rings again and I fish it out of my purse. It\u0027s probably my mom, since I\u0027d left a message for her after I charged my phone in the suite. But when I look at the Caller ID, I feel a jolt of surprise. It\u0027s Leah Becker, Caleb\u0027s sister. We stopped being friends after the accident, but after Caleb left Paradise, we started talking again. Leah\u0027s emotions run high, and they\u0027re right on the surface. She\u0027s emotionally fragile and no longer the best friend I once knew. I hope she\u0027ll snap out of it at some point.\\n\\n \"Hey, Leah. I\u0027m glad you called.\" I watch as Matt joins the rest of the group, giving me privacy.\\n\\n \"Hey, Maggie,\" Leah says softly. She\u0027s still got a lot of issues regarding the accident, and even though I\u0027ve forgiven her, she hasn\u0027t actually forgiven herself. \"How\u0027s the trip?\"\\n\\n \"Good. We\u0027ve only talked to one group so far, but it was okay. Right now we\u0027re staying at the dorms at Freeman University, right by the Wisconsin border. What have you been doing?\"\\n\\n Silence. Leah doesn\u0027t talk as much as she used to, so I pretty much hold up our conversations now. It\u0027s okay. I know it\u0027s part of her own healing process.\\n\\n \"Not much,\" she finally says. \"Just hanging around, mostly.\"\\n\\n That\u0027s pretty much all there is to do in Paradise in the summer. Some people take vacations, but most people stay in Paradise and never leave. I know two people who left Paradise-my father and Caleb.\\n\\n That thought freezes me in my tracks, and I just stand on the sidewalk as the rest of the groups walks ahead of me. I stare blindly after them while the reality hits me: I get left behind by the men in my life who are supposed to love me.\\n\\n I blink, and focus on the restaurant a half a block away. Everyone is out front, gesturing for me to get off the phone. I can\u0027t hang up with Leah without telling her, \"Caleb\u0027s here.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/return-to-paradise-leaving-paradise-2/page-8.html","bookId":2772,"book":{"id":2772,"title":"Return to Paradise (Leaving Paradise #2)","description":"Storyline: Return to Paradise (Leaving Paradise #2) \\n Caleb Becker left Paradise eight months ago, taking with him the secret he promised to take to his grave.
