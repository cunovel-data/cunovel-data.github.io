{"id":86675,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"\"Yeah, and I bet I know her better than you.\" Just when I\u0027m about to laugh at that ridiculous comment, Leah says, \"Julio\u0027s right. For the longest time I wanted to tell you how I felt, but I couldn\u0027t. You were sad or angry or pissed off... and I was afraid of hurting you again.\" My sister chokes back tears and runs into my arms. \"I\u0027m so sorry about what I did to you. Julio told me how it was in jail for the two of you, and I\u0027m just ... so sorry.\" She swipes at her eyes and says, \"I think we need to call Dad and have him meet us at the rehab center. Whether Mom realizes it or not, she needs her son back.\" An hour later I\u0027m sitting in the waiting room of New Horizons Recovery Center. My dad didn\u0027t really want us to have this meeting because he thinks my mom\u0027s emotional status is too fragile, but when Leah and I said we were coming to see her with or without him, he agreed to meet us. A woman with the name Rachel on her nametag greets us, then has us go into what\u0027s called a group therapy room to wait for my mom. It makes me feel stiff and uncomfortable, because we had mandatory group therapy sessions when I was in jail. I have to remind myself that this isn\u0027t jail. My mom wants to be here. She could leave on her own, but has chosen to stay because she doesn\u0027t trust herself not to use prescription drugs as a crutch when things get tough. \"You can have a seat, Caleb,\" Rachel says in a soft voice probably meant to calm me. I try not to pace back and forth in the room like a caged animal, but I can\u0027t sit because I\u0027ve got a bunch of pent-up nervous energy. \"No, thanks.\" The chairs are situated in a circle. My dad is sitting in one chair in his three-piece suit and tie. My sister, surprisingly, isn\u0027t slumped in her chair. She\u0027s sitting straight up and has a determined look on her face. If Julio was the one who talked her into facing all this crap head-on, he\u0027s a fucking genius. My sister doesn\u0027t know it yet, but I\u0027m not abandoning her. She\u0027s not the only one who made mistakes the night of the accident. As soon as my mom walks in the room in grey sweats with the New Horizons logo on the front, I realize she\u0027s different. Her face is drawn and her spirit seems somehow ... lost. My first instinct is to go up and hug her but I figure out, by the way she has her hands folded on her chest, that she doesn\u0027t want any affection from me or anyone else in the room. Mom stops in her tracks when she sees me step toward her. \"Why are you here?\" My veins are pumping hard and I\u0027m so damn tense my arms are stiff at my sides. This is already a billion times harder than I imagined. \"I came back. Maggie told me you guys needed me. At first I didn\u0027t want to believe her...\" \"You left me. A good son doesn\u0027t leave his mother.\" Her words cut deep. Oh, man, I should never have left. I thought it would be best, that everything would be okay if the \"Caleb Quotient\" was out of the equation. I was wrong. I\u0027ve managed to screw up so much in such a short amount of time. \"I\u0027m sorry, Mom.\" Deflated, I sit in the chair next to Leah. \"I\u0027m sorry, too,\" Leah says. \"I need to apologize to everyone in this family.\" My sister turns to me and puts her hand on my knee. I put my hand on top of hers. I feel her hesitation and fear as if it\u0027s my own. But I also feel her determination to set the wrongs of the past right. \"Mom, Dad,\" Leah says after I nod to her, giving her silent support. \"I was the one who hit Maggie the night of the accident.\" Watching the expression change on my parents\u0027 faces is pure torture. At first they cock their heads to the side as if they\u0027ve heard the words wrong. When Leah doesn\u0027t say anything else, the reality of what she said starts to sink in. \"No,\" my mom whispers, shaking her head. \"No. No.\" \"What are you saying, Leah?\" my dad asks, his voice about to crack. \"What. Are. You. Saying?\" A stream of tears start flowing down Leah\u0027s face. \"I was at the party. I\u0027d had maybe two beers. When I was driving home, I swerved to hit a squirrel. I didn\u0027t mean to hit Maggie.\" She\u0027s choking on her tears now, and I look up at the ceiling in an attempt to hold myself in check. It\u0027s not working. Dammit. Tears start forming in my eyes. I try to blink them back, but it\u0027s no use. Seeing my sister so upset, seeing my dad and mom frozen in shock, and knowing that one fateful night destroyed my family and permanently damaged Maggie\u0027s leg is just too much for me. I dab at my own tears and attempt an explanation. \"When Leah came back to the party all freaked out, I told her I\u0027d take care of it,\" I tell them. \"I was so wasted that night, I wasn\u0027t thinking straight. When the cops asked who was driving, I said it was me.\" \"Oh, God, Caleb, I\u0027m so sorry,\" Leah cries out. \"I don\u0027t know how you could ever forgive me. I don\u0027t deserve forgiveness for the hell I put you through.\" She buries her head in her hands. \"I can\u0027t believe this is happening,\" my dad says. \"This can\u0027t be happening.\" \"No,\" my mom says again. I look over at Rachel. I think she was expecting a regular family therapy session, and from her deer-in-headlights look I think we\u0027ve shocked her into silence. I nod. \"It\u0027s true.\" Man, I feel a sort of freedom I haven\u0027t felt in a long time. I want to share this with Maggie. I guess now is as good a time as any to say the other piece of news I\u0027ve been holding back. \"I know this is another bomb I\u0027m dropping, but Maggie Armstrong and I are dating. I didn\u0027t mean for it to happen. I denied it for a long time, then hid it for a while ... and I\u0027m not gonna do that anymore.\" \"Does she know...\" my dad says, his voice trailing off. I know he\u0027s on the brink of breaking down. I can see it in his trembling lip and shaking hands. \"Yeah, she knows.\" I look over at Leah. \"Maggie knows everything.\" My mom looks at me. It\u0027s the first time she\u0027s looked at me without contempt or scorn since I was arrested. She keeps shaking her head, as if she\u0027s trying to wrap her brain around this new, totally unexpected information. \"Leah, how could you?\" Mom asks, her words coming out slow. \"How could you stand by and let your brother go to jail for something you did?\" \"I don\u0027t know, Mom. I don\u0027t know. But I\u0027m going to make it right.\" Her puffy, bloodshot eyes meet mine. \"I\u0027m turning myself in tomorrow.\" THIRTY-SIX Maggie aggie, can I come over?\" Caleb\u0027s voice comes .through the phone. He doesn\u0027t sound happy. \"Sure. What\u0027s wrong?\" \"I\u0027ll tell you when I get there.\" My mom and Lou are right downstairs. I haven\u0027t told her about Caleb. I wanted to. To be honest, I\u0027ve been stalling because the last thing I want to do is upset her when she\u0027s still trying to figure things out with my dad and Lou. It\u0027s time I confess to my mom the truth about me and Caleb. Lou and my mom are in the kitchen. They\u0027re both chopping vegetables for some sort of soup concoction they\u0027re making. She\u0027s still not wearing his ring, but he\u0027s come over every day and is really fighting for the right to be with her forever. She made my dad postpone his move here ... indefinitely. \"Mom, can I talk to you?\" My mom, complete with flour in her hair and a carrot in her hand, looks up from the cutting board. \"Is anything wrong?\" \"No. It\u0027s just that ... if it weren\u0027t for Caleb, I might have given up on life.\" My mom stops chopping. \"What?\" \"After the accident, it was Caleb who made me realize life was worth living.\" \"Maggie, that\u0027s a bunch of nonsense.\" \"No, Mom, it\u0027s not. You want to know why?\" \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027re going to tell me no matter what I say.\" I don\u0027t know how she\u0027s going to react. She\u0027s not exactly happy, but at least she\u0027s listening. \"Because he pulled me out of my depression. You didn\u0027t even see it because you were so happy I was home and not living in hospitals anymore. But I wasn\u0027t happy. I was miserable until Caleb came back from jail and helped me realize I was worth something even though I had a disability.\" \"Why are you telling me this now?\" my mom asks. \"Because he\u0027s coming over, and I want you to be prepared...\" The doorbell rings. \"That\u0027s him, Mom. Just, be nice and don\u0027t judge him until I tell you everything.\" I rush to open the door. Caleb\u0027s bloodshot eyes greet me. He doesn\u0027t say anything; he just pulls me close and hugs me tight right on the front steps of my house. \"I saw my mom today,\" he mumbles into my hair. \"Oh, God, Maggie, it was so awful. Leah told our parents she was the one who hit you.\" I know that was probably the hardest thing Leah has ever done. \"How is she?\" \"She was crying. A lot.\" He pulls away, but holds on to my hands. \"She\u0027s determined to turn herself in. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going to happen. I just called Damon. He\u0027s coming over tomorrow to advise us on what to do.\" I touch Caleb\u0027s forehead to mine. I can see in his face how much this is tearing him apart. \"I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027ll go with you. Whatever I can do to help, I will.\" \"What\u0027s going on?\" my mom asks, confused. \"I don\u0027t know why you\u0027re here,\" she says to Caleb. \"And pray tell, why are you two holding hands?\" I take a deep breath and squeeze Caleb\u0027s hand. We\u0027re going to do this together. I lead him inside my house and stand before my mom and Lou. \"Caleb and I have something to tell you both.\" I look at Caleb through watery eyes. \"I know this is going to be a shock, but try and understand...\" This has got to be one of the toughest days of Caleb\u0027s life. While he\u0027s freeing himself from blame, the reality is that he\u0027s incriminating his sister at the same time. \"I wasn\u0027t the one who hit Maggie,\" he says. He clears his throat. \"Umm...\" He holds my hand tight. \"It was Leah.\" \"You\u0027re lying.\" \"He\u0027s not, Mom,\" I tell her. \"Why?\" my mom asks, tears now streaming down her face. I\u0027m crying, too. Caleb gives a half-shrug. \"I thought I could handle it better than Leah. I thought I was sparing her from going through something that would ruin her. I could handle going to jail, but my sister couldn\u0027t. The whole thing just kind of spiraled out of control, and I realized I was wrong, but it was too late.\" He looks at me. \"And Maggie was caught in the middle of it all.\" Lou walks out of the room for a minute, then reappears with a box of tissues. He hands a few to my mom. She dabs her eyes with the tissue. \"This is a lot to take in. Maggie, did you know about this?\" I nod. \"How could you not say anything? I\u0027m your mother.\" \"I didn\u0027t figure it out until right before Caleb left. I didn\u0027t say anything because I wanted Caleb to be the one to reveal it. Somehow I felt it was his secret to tell. Besides, I was desperate to stop reliving the accident. I wanted it over. I needed to move on for my own sanity.\" I look up at the boy who filled the void in my life. \"Caleb helped me realize I couldn\u0027t stop living my life because of my disability.\" My mom shakes her head. \"I need time to digest this. This is just... too much for me. I need to be alone right now. She hurries up the stairs. A minute later, I hear her door shut, and I wince. I never wanted to hurt her or make her feel betrayed by either of us.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/return-to-paradise-leaving-paradise-2/page-28.html","bookId":2772,"book":{"id":2772,"title":"Return to Paradise (Leaving Paradise #2)","description":"Storyline: Return to Paradise (Leaving Paradise #2) Caleb Becker left Paradise eight months ago, taking with him the secret he promised to take to his grave.
