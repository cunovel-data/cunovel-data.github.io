{"id":86667,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"Regret tugs at me, but I ignore it. There are some things we can\u0027t change even if we want to.\n Trish gets picked up by her parents, sister, and brother. After hearing Erin\u0027s story, Trish\u0027s mom had to take a tissue from her purse so her own makeup wouldn\u0027t run. After that, the entire family packed Erin up in their van. I think they might just adopt the silent, tattooed girl. Matt left right afterwards, when his big brother came to give him a lift.\n Re-START is officially over. I guess it\u0027s time for me to figure out where to go next.\n One thing is for sure-I need to get far away. This time Chicago is too close. I wasn\u0027t joking when I told Maggie I was going to Arizona. Problem is, I have exactly twelve dollars and sixty-three cents to my name. I can work odd jobs, construction day jobs if I can find them, until I can save up enough money to get me out of Illinois.\n I swing my duffle over my shoulder, glad I have at least a few bucks to my name. I know of a cheap campground a few miles from here where I can stay a couple of nights while I figure out if there are any temporary jobs I can take to make some quick cash. I\u0027ll need at least a few hundred to get me a one-way bus ticket to Arizona.\n \"Hey, Caleb, wait up!\"\n I turn to find Lenny jogging to catch up with me. \"Miss your bus?\" I ask.\n \"Nah.\" He shrugs. \"I didn\u0027t really have a bus to catch. I was thinking of, you know ... going with you,\" he says, as if it was something we\u0027d already discussed and agreed to.\n Umm ... I don\u0027t think so.\n \"No, you\u0027re not. Go find out where Trish lives and follow her to her house.\"\n \"Are you kidding? The girl hates me.\"\n \"Maybe that\u0027s because you didn\u0027t wipe your pubes off the toilet.\"\n I keep walking.\n Lenny doesn\u0027t get the hint, and I\u0027m starting to think he\u0027s serious about coming with because he continues to follow me.\n \"Come on, Caleb. Have a heart. Think of us as Fred and Barney, Ben and Jerry, Thelma and Louise. You know you want to.\"\n I stop walking and look right at Lenny. \"Thelma and Louise died at the end of that chick flick.\"\n \"They died holding hands. Didn\u0027t it bring you to tears?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"You still owe me a hug, remember?\"\n \"No, I don\u0027t.\"\n \"So you\u0027re gonna leave me stranded here? What, afraid I\u0027m gonna cramp your style?\"\n \"I don\u0027t have a style, Lenny. Go home. You do have a home, don\u0027t you?\" He doesn\u0027t answer. \"You told Damon you were going home.\"\n \"I lied.\"\n Shit. \"If you haven\u0027t figured it out yet, I don\u0027t have a house to go to either. I\u0027m going to a campground so I can at least have a place to do the four S\u0027s-shit, shower, shave, and sleep.\"\n \"Cool.\"\n \"There\u0027s nothing cool about it.\" I can tell Lenny\u0027s not letting up. He\u0027s like a damn stray dog that\u0027s following me. I glance at him. Normally he sports a cocky-ass expression, but not now. Now he looks worried, as if he\u0027s afraid I\u0027m gonna ditch him and leave him alone.\n I keep walking, feeling deja vu. Maggie followed me off campus and look where that got me.\n Lenny walks beside me. I don\u0027t tell him to back off, because I think the guy is scared to be left alone.\n \"Thanks, Caleb,\" he says after a while.\n \"Just... don\u0027t piss me off,\" I tell him.\n \"I won\u0027t. I promise.\"\n It takes us almost an hour to walk to the Happy Camper Campground. I register and pay the lady in the office for a camping spot that costs me seven dollars a day. It would\u0027ve cost me twenty-two if I required a water spout, but I can just go to the community bathroom for that.\n No matter how cheap this place is, I\u0027ve got to find some quick cash. Once the Illinois summer is over, winter creeps in fast and furious. I\u0027ll freeze my ass off and die if I don\u0027t head for Arizona by then.\n When it\u0027s dark and we\u0027ve bought a couple of hot dogs at the little on-site store, the family at the site next to us gives us a few pieces of their wood and fire starters. Gotta love the generosity of campers.\n After I\u0027ve washed up in the Happy Camper Campgrounds community bathroom/shower area, I pull out a light blanket I bought when I was living at Rio\u0027s place.\n \"Here,\" I say, handing it to Lenny. \"We can switch off days we use it.\"\n \"I\u0027m fine,\" he responds.\n I watch as Lenny rolls one of his shirts up to make a pillow, then pulls out a pair of sweats from his duffle and puts it over his face, making a circle in the middle where his mouth is.\n \"Why the hell are you wearing pants on your head?\" I ask. \"You look ridiculous.\"\n \"I\u0027m not risking getting sunburned or mosquito bites on my face again. I\u0027ve got an extra pair of boxers if you want to cover your face. They\u0027re not washed, but-\"\n \"No thanks.\" Just the thought makes me want to puke.\n Thank God we got assigned a grassy campsite. I spread the blanket on the ground. A sleeping bag would be great, but I\u0027m happy to have my little spot of land for the night without having to worry about getting busted by the cops or bothered by other homeless people.\n \"Really, Lenny, why are you here?\" I ask. \"I mean seriously, man, what\u0027s your story?\"\n \"I don\u0027t got a story,\" Lenny says, lifting his pants off his face. \"You heard me the past four weeks tell all the sordid details. I got drunk, stole a car, and drove it into a lake. End of story.\"\n He turns his back to me and faces the opposite direction.\n I stare up at the sky, the stars and moon lighting up the endless universe. Wherever Maggie is, whether she\u0027s in Paradise or in Spain, she\u0027ll be looking up at the same moon and same stars.\n Will she ever think about me? Will she remember the night we spent in the castle or last night when we slept in each other\u0027s arms? Or will she only remember the times we argued and tried to push each other away, because it was easier than admitting or accepting what was really happening between us?\n Damn. I better get a grip and forget about Maggie Armstrong. This is my life-here on this little seven-dollar rented piece of land ... I look over at Lenny ... and it doesn\u0027t seem like my lot in life is gonna get better anytime soon.\n The biggest torture right now is knowing I won\u0027t sleep much. When it\u0027s all quiet and I\u0027m just lying down at night, that\u0027s when my mind wanders to things I have no right thinking about.\n \"It was my mom\u0027s boyfriend\u0027s car,\" Lenny says, his voice cutting through the silence. He\u0027d been so quiet the past hour I thought he was sleeping. I guess I should\u0027ve known better, since he wasn\u0027t snoring. \"He packed up and left her five years ago and I thought he was gone for good. I can\u0027t believe she took him back. Want to know what he did?\"\n \"You don\u0027t have to tell me.\" I\u0027m not one to pry into other people\u0027s business, \u0027cause I don\u0027t want them prying into mine.\n I look over at Lenny, who\u0027s got his palms pressed to his eyes. I\u0027ve never seen him so serious.\n \"When my mom wasn\u0027t home he used to touch me.\"\n \"Damn, Lenny. That\u0027s some serious shit.\"\n \"Tell me about it.\" Silence fills the air, and he doesn\u0027t say anything else for a while. \"At first I didn\u0027t really get what was goin\u0027 on, as if my brain couldn\u0027t wrap around the reality of what was happening. I was only twelve when it started. By the time the asshole split, I just wanted to erase it from my mind and forget it ever happened. I didn\u0027t tell anyone. But when he showed up in March and my mom said she invited him to live with us, I freaked.\"\n \"Did you tell your mom about what he did to you?\"\n \"Yeah, but she pretty much got pissed off and called me a liar. The first night the guy moved back in, I got drunk, stole his car, and drove it in the lake. My mom didn\u0027t even come to court. I hear she married the douche. Damon said I could join the Re-START program instead of serving probation time. I promised him I\u0027d go back home and work things out with my mom, but that\u0027s never gonna happen. She chose to trust a boyfriend over her son.\"\n \"I don\u0027t even know what to say.\" Somehow Lenny\u0027s story makes me feel like all the stuff I\u0027ve gone through is nothing.\n \"You don\u0027t need to say anything. I didn\u0027t tell you to get your pity.\"\n \"Does Damon know what the guy did to you?\"\n \"Nah.\"\n \"You should\u0027ve told him.\"\n \"Yeah, well you should\u0027ve told your parents the truth about the night you didn\u0027t hit Maggie with your car, but you didn\u0027t have the guts.\"\n A flash of regret makes me tense up. \"You\u0027re right,\" I admit. \"But I promised I\u0027d keep quiet.\"\n \"Yeah, well, I made a promise to that scumbag that I\u0027d never tell my mom what he did to me, but I didn\u0027t keep that promise. I don\u0027t have choices anymore, Caleb. I can\u0027t go back home. It\u0027ll be different for you.\"\n \"What are you saying?\"\n Lenny sits up. \"I\u0027m sayin\u0027 that you\u0027ve got choices I don\u0027t have. Hell, just because your mom\u0027s got some prescription drug addiction and wants you to act all perfect and your old man\u0027s a pussy doesn\u0027t mean you have to give up on them.\" Lenny turns his back to me again. \"If I were you-\"\n \"Yeah, well you\u0027re not me,\" I cut in harshly.\n I get up and walk around the campground, angry at myself and at Lenny and at Leah and at the world in general. I\u0027m glad most people are sleeping and the place is quiet except for the crackling of fires and low whispers of the few campers still awake.\n I circle the campground five times, thinking the entire time about what Lenny said. Indecision replaces my anger. As I start walking faster and faster, crazy thoughts run through my head. Soon I start running. The faster I run, the more my mind races with thoughts of what was and what could be. No, I can\u0027t, I tell myself. But what ifI did?\n I get back to my little piece of rented land and see Lenny lying there by himself, sleeping on the ground. It\u0027s like looking at myself from far away, and it\u0027s pathetic-I\u0027m pathetic. I have tons of regrets, stemming from my fear of being rejected by people I care about.\n I don\u0027t want to be alone. I don\u0027t want my family to think I gave up on them. I also don\u0027t want Maggie to think I gave up on us. My mouth goes dry and my heart is racing as I realize what I\u0027m going to go.\n I\u0027m going back to Paradise.\n I\u0027m going home.\n TWENTY-FOUR\n Maggie\n om, it was no big deal.\"\n \"How can you say that, Maggie? It\u0027s the biggest deal.\"\n I\u0027ve been sitting at our kitchen table for the past twenty minutes not being able to eat any of the lunch set in front of us because I\u0027m too busy getting lectured by my mother about the dangers of being on the Re-START trip with Caleb. Last night she hardly talked to me. Now she\u0027s giving me a lecture.\n \"I\u0027m appalled that the program coordinator allowed it to happen.\"\n Mom-\n \"He could have hurt you.\"\n Mom-\n \"If you think the Caleb Becker you saw on that trip is the same boy who lived next door to us when you were growing up, guess again.\n Mom-\n \"How can I trust you to make the right choices when you\u0027re over four thousand miles away in Spain, Maggie? If you think it was okay to travel around the Midwest with that boy, what other irresponsible decisions are you going to make?\" She picks up her fork and pokes her chicken breast. \"To be honest, I hoped when he left, he was gone for good.\"\n \"He is gone for good, Mom,\" I tell her. \"He didn\u0027t think he\u0027d be welcome back in Paradise, and I told him he was wrong. I told him people would give him a chance and not judge him.\" I take my napkin off my lap and put it on the table. \"I guess I was wrong.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/return-to-paradise-leaving-paradise-2/page-20.html","bookId":2772,"book":{"id":2772,"title":"Return to Paradise (Leaving Paradise #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Return to Paradise (Leaving Paradise #2) \n Caleb Becker left Paradise eight months ago, taking with him the secret he promised to take to his grave.
