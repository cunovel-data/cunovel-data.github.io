{"id":86661,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"\"I like it here with you better.\"\n He shakes his head. \"You\u0027re crazy, you know that?\"\n Yep.\n He puts his arm around me. \"Go to sleep. I know you\u0027re tired.\"\n \"What about you?\"\n \"My mind is racing and I won\u0027t be able to sleep tonight, so you should.\"\n I nestle into his lap and try to forget why and how we got into this situation. I just keep telling myself that it\u0027ll be okay. We\u0027ll figure a way to work it out. In the end, I\u0027ll make sure Caleb reunites with his family in Paradise. I don\u0027t know exactly how I\u0027m going to orchestrate it, but I will.\n I have to.\n \"Are you still mad at me?\" I murmur against his thigh.\n \"Definitely.\"\n \"What can I do to make you less mad?\"\n \"Stay the hell away from me, Maggie.\"\n \"Is that really and truly what you want?\" I ask.\n \"Don\u0027t make me answer that question,\" he says, chuckling cynically.\n \"Why not?\"\n \"Maggie, I gotta tell you something.\" I notice that the frown lines on his face are pronounced.\n \"What?\"\n \"Being with you was never a mistake.\" He gives a short laugh. \"Hell, being with you kept me sane while I was home. You and Mrs. Reynolds made being in Paradise bearable.\"\n I reach up and stroke his stubble with the tips of my fingers. \"Thanks, Caleb. I needed to hear that. I know I\u0027m not ideal, and I\u0027ll never be normal-\"\n \"Maggie, don\u0027t ever say that, okay?\"\n \"But-\"\n \"There are no buts. You\u0027re here with me, and I don\u0027t fucking deserve your time, let alone your support. I lied to you, I deceived you, and I left you. Why you\u0027re here with me is beyond my comprehension.\"\n \"You know why I\u0027m here,\" I tell him. \"I believe in you.\n \"Yeah, well that makes one of us.\" Without another word, he wraps his arms around me and holds me tight. \"I\u0027m sorry I lied to you,\" he whispers.\n \"I know you are.\"\n Feeling safe with Caleb\u0027s arm around me, I let myself relax and get really sleepy.\n He brushes stray hairs out of my face. The last thing I remember is Caleb lightly tracing random patterns on my arm, leg, and back. It feels so good I let myself drift to sleep.\n He hasn\u0027t changed. He\u0027s the same boy I fell in love with back in Paradise.\n I love you.\n The words hover on the tip of my tongue, and I feel my lips frame the syllables, but no sound comes out as my eyelids droop and Caleb gently strokes my hair over and over again.\n In the morning, I wake to find him watching me.\n \"Morning,\" I say as I stretch. My leg is retaliating from sleeping on the rough wood chips, but I try and hide the pain from him. \"Do we have a plan yet?\"\n \"Yeah, I\u0027ve got a plan,\" he says. \"But you\u0027re not gonna like it.\"\n SEVENTEEN\n Caleb\n aggie sits up and bites her bottom lip. She\u0027s got wood chips stuck in her hair and her eyes are all bloodshot. \"Don\u0027t you think we should discuss the plan together?\"\n \"No,\" I say stoically.\n \"Why not?\"\n \"Because you\u0027re not rational.\"\n \"I beg your pardon,\" she says, wood chips falling from her hair with each word. \"But I\u0027m the one who actually slept last night. You\u0027ve had no sleep. I vote that I\u0027m the rational one, and I vote that we discuss this together.\"\n I stand and hold out my hand to her. \"You\u0027ve never been rational. And before you go begging my pardon again, you were the one who ran off with me in the middle of the night with just a backpack full of stuff.\"\n She takes my hand and lets me help her up. I can tell she\u0027s not steady, so I hold her by the waist and support her while her body adjusts.\n When she\u0027s steady, I let her go. She folds her arms on her chest and puts that straight, aristocratic nose of hers in the air. There isn\u0027t a lot of space in this castle, so our bodies brush against each other. \"That wasn\u0027t irrational. Leaving with you was a calculated risk.\"\n \"Calculated?\" I ask, skepticism lacing my voice.\n \"Just forget it.\" She picks up her backpack and grabs my hand for support as she maneuvers out of the castle. It\u0027s early but there are already a few moms with their kids on the playground. They give us dirty looks, as though we were caught fooling around inside the castle\u0027s walls.\n \"So what\u0027s this plan you have that I\u0027m not going to like?\"\n \"I\u0027ll tell you later,\" I say.\n \"You\u0027re just stalling the inevitable.\"\n \"I know. I\u0027m good at that.\"\n I can tell Maggie\u0027s leg is stiff by the way she\u0027s walking slowly and tentatively stepping on her left foot. Man, I wish I could take the pain myself. It sucks knowing she\u0027ll always have that limp.\n Anger at what my sister did to Maggie rushes through me. If it weren\u0027t for Leah\u0027s irresponsible choice of getting into that car when she\u0027d been drinking, maybe she wouldn\u0027t have swerved so much when that squirrel jumped in front of her and Maggie wouldn\u0027t have been hit.\n I can play the \"what if\" game forever, but it won\u0027t change the fact that Maggie is the one who\u0027ll always have the physical repercussions of that night. Nothing I do or say will ever change that.\n \"Do you need to sit down?\" I ask, silently kicking myself because I\u0027ve put her in this situation.\n \"I\u0027m okay. Walking usually helps lessen the cramping.\"\n I take her backpack and sling my own duffle over my shoulder. I shake my head as I watch her struggle.\n She stops and puts her hand on her hip. \"Don\u0027t look at me like that.\"\n \"Like what?\"\n \"Like you blame yourself. We both know ... well, actually, now everyone at Re-START knows, that it\u0027s not your fault at all even though you\u0027ve been paying for it for almost two years.\" Her eyes take on this look of pity, which doesn\u0027t sit well in my gut. \"Just point me to the nearest place I can go to the bathroom and get some breakfast. I\u0027m starving. I\u0027ve got about two hundred dollars to spend before we have to beg for money.\"\n Her words slice right through me. \"You\u0027re not begging for money. Ever. Got it? I\u0027ve got about twenty bucks. After that, I\u0027ll figure something out.\" Just the picture in my head of her having to beg for anything makes my skin crawl.\n \"I was kidding,\" she says, surprising me with a grin. \"I\u0027m not the begging type.\"\n \"Sorry,\" I say. Sorry for overreacting. Sorry for putting her in this situation. Sorry for every fucking thing.\n We walk a couple of blocks until we get to Pete\u0027s Place, a little diner which should probably be condemned by the look of the grease-and-mildew-stained ceiling tiles, but they\u0027ve got a free bathroom and dirt cheap food, and that\u0027s what we need. After we get seated in a booth and Maggie heads for the bathroom, I sit back and think about how I\u0027m going to break the news of my plan to her.\n I look around at the two other occupied tables. A guy with a ripped flannel shirt is sipping a cup of coffee by the counter. An old guy is eating alone in another booth, looking out the window as he takes one slow bite of his bread after another. I wonder what he\u0027s looking at or waiting for ... or if staring out the window is better than remembering that he\u0027s alone at a diner eating by himself. Or maybe he\u0027s not really looking out the window. Maybe he\u0027s daydreaming about some girl he loved and lost.\n I don\u0027t want to end up like either of those guys-alone and pathetic.\n When Maggie comes back, her ponytail is gone. She doesn\u0027t look like she slept on a bed of wood chips anymore. She slides into the booth opposite me. I reach across the table and take both her hands in mine. The fact that she was willing to walk away with me last night with just a backpack humbles me.\n \"Maggie...\" I get a lump in my throat the size of a grapefruit. I don\u0027t want to say it, but dammit, it has to be said. \"I\u0027m taking you back.\" Her eyes grow big and she opens her mouth I\u0027m sure to protest, but I add, \"Do you know what it does to me every time I see you wince in pain?\"\n She pulls her hands away and lays them in her lap. \"I\u0027m fine.\"\n \"Stop pretending. I thought we weren\u0027t gonna lie to each other anymore.\"\n I watch as she bites her bottom lip. \"Okay, I\u0027m lying. But I don\u0027t care if I\u0027ve got a little discomfort or pain.\" She looks up at me and tilts her head. I can tell the wheels are turning and she\u0027s thinking too much. She hesitates at first, but then blurts out, \"Have you ever told a girl you loved her? Not like your mom, but like-\"\n \"You mean Kendra.\"\n \"Yeah. I mean Kendra.\"\n That\u0027s a loaded question. Kendra told me on our first date that she was in love with me. It didn\u0027t take long before we were a couple and were making out ... and not long after that we had sex. Lots of it. She spouted the word \"love\" as if it was water. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve heard or said the word \"love\" since I was arrested.\n I did tell Kendra I loved her, but I\u0027m not even sure I knew what it meant at the time.\n \"Why do you want to know?\"\n She shrugs. \"I just do. You\u0027ve never said it...\"\n She doesn\u0027t finish her sentence, but I know what she was going to say. I don\u0027t want to go there. Not now ... but after what she\u0027s done for me, I can\u0027t totally avoid the subject. She deserves that much.\n \"I don\u0027t say it to anyone, which is why you\u0027re going back to Re-START. I can\u0027t let you come with me. It\u0027s not safe and you don\u0027t deserve this. You\u0027re going to Spain, like you\u0027ve always wanted. If I said the L-word, it would change everything. I know you, Maggie. You\u0027d feel obligated to stay here and ditch your plans. I\u0027d feel like shit for making you change your life for me ... it\u0027s not worth it.\"\n I\u0027m not worth it.\n The waitress brings the eggs and toast we ordered then disappears just as quickly as she appeared.\n Maggie smiles sheepishly from across the table as she picks up her fork. \"So come to Spain with me. I\u0027m registered to be an exchange student for my freshman year. It\u0027s only for nine months.\"\n \"You know I can\u0027t. What am I gonna do there, sit and watch you study? I didn\u0027t even graduate high school and I hardly know a lick of Spanish.\"\n \"You could get a GED and apply.\"\n I shake my head. As if that\u0027s even an option at this point. I\u0027m a lost cause with a pathetically bleak future, and hardly a penny to my name. \"Oh, sure, then we could get married and live happily ever after if you\u0027ll hop on my flying carpet and rub the genie lamp I have in my duffle. Maybe we could buy a Spanish castle while we\u0027re at it.\"\n When my dad married my mom, he was going to school to be a dentist and she was president of the ladies\u0027 auxiliary. Everything in their lives was strategically planned, up until the day I got arrested and went to jail. \"My mom would shit if she heard this conversation.\"\n \"I was going to tell you this earlier, but I didn\u0027t know how. Caleb, your mom was in rehab when I left Paradise.\"\n My entire body tenses. \"I don\u0027t want to talk about her. I don\u0027t want to talk about my family at all.\"\n A bell over the diner door makes me look to see what other misfit is about to patronize Pete\u0027s Place. A big black guy comes walking toward us.\n Damon.\n I\u0027m busted.\n I shake my head in frustration and look over at her. \"You didn\u0027t.\"\n \"I did.\" She holds up her cell phone. \"I suspected you were about to run off and ditch me.\"\n I can\u0027t fucking believe this. \"You sold me out. What happened to your desperate plea to make decisions together?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/return-to-paradise-leaving-paradise-2/page-14.html","bookId":2772,"book":{"id":2772,"title":"Return to Paradise (Leaving Paradise #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Return to Paradise (Leaving Paradise #2) \n Caleb Becker left Paradise eight months ago, taking with him the secret he promised to take to his grave.
