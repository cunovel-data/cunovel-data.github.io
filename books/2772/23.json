{"id":86670,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"\"Cool. Give me a fist bump, Dennis.\" Lenny holds out his fist mid-air and waits for my dad to do the same.\\n\\n My dad doesn\u0027t. I\u0027m not sure he\u0027s ever given anyone a fist bump. It\u0027s not that my dad is stupid or old fashioned. He\u0027s just ... proper. He doesn\u0027t stray from the norm, because he likes his life neat and tidy.\\n\\n Me being home is messing up his tidy life.\\n\\n I\u0027m sure it\u0027s killing him that my mom is in rehab. He probably doesn\u0027t know what to do about it, and there\u0027s no rule book or game plan when it comes to the grim realities of our lives.\\n\\n \"Are you guys, uh, in town for a while?\" Dad asks me. \"Or are you just passing through?\"\\n\\n It\u0027s a question you\u0027d ask an acquaintance, not your son.\\n\\n Leah is leaning against the stairs, waiting intently for my answer.\\n\\n I\u0027m tempted to say I\u0027m just passing through. It would be easier than telling the truth, that Lenny\u0027s story made me realize I need to come back and make peace with my family.\\n\\n \"I was thinking of staying for a few weeks,\" I mumble.\\n\\n \"At a hotel, or...\" Dad\u0027s voice trails off.\\n\\n \"I was hoping to stay here, Dad.\"\\n\\n Lenny sticks his chin on my shoulder. \"Me too, Denms.\\n\\n My dad scratches his head. \"Umm ... I guess, umm ... we don\u0027t really have beds to spare. We turned your room into an office.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll sleep on the couch,\" I tell him, feeling like I\u0027m begging for a place to stay in my own house. It doesn\u0027t sit well in my gut.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll sleep on the floor,\" Lenny chimes in, apparently having no problems begging. \"Unless you want me to sleep in bed with Leah.\" Lenny holds his hands up when all of our heads snap up at his last comment. \"Just kidding.\"\\n\\n My sister steps forward and says, \"I\u0027ll go get some sheets and blankets from the hall closet.\"\\n\\n \"Okay,\" my dad says. \"But you boys better keep the house clean. My wife hates a messy house.\"\\n\\n \"Got it,\" I tell him, wondering if I need to remind him that \"his wife\" is my mom. And that she\u0027s in rehab, not here.\\n\\n The loud sound of Lenny clapping his hands together makes us all turn to him. \"Now that that\u0027s settled, what\u0027s for dinner?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe we should order in some pizza,\" Dad says as he walks upstairs. He always changes into jeans and a T-shirt after work. It\u0027s his ritual.\\n\\n When my sister and dad are out of hearing range, I let out a slow breath.\\n\\n I\u0027m home.\\n\\n It doesn\u0027t feel like home, though. I wonder if I\u0027d get a better reception if I showed up at Maggie\u0027s house. Who am I kidding? Her mom would toss me out or call the cops to have me thrown back in jail.\\n\\n \"Your dad is one weird dude,\" Lenny says. \"But I like him.\"\\n\\n At dinner, when Lenny excuses himself to go to the bathroom, I ask, \"So, can I go see Mom?\"\\n\\n My dad puts down his pizza. \"I don\u0027t think so, Caleb.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\"\\n\\n \"Because she\u0027s fragile. I\u0027m not sure she could handle it right now.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m her son,\" I say through clenched teeth.\\n\\n \"After you left, she said you were dead to her.\"\\n\\n I look to my sister for confirmation, but she\u0027s staring at her plate. Anger starts to fire up in my veins. \"Leah!\"\\n\\n She looks up. \"What?\"\\n\\n What? All she can say is what?\\n\\n I stand, my chair scraping the floor. \"Thanks a lot, Leah,\" I grind out. \"Thanks a lot for nothing.\"\\n\\n TWENTY-EIGHT\\n\\n Maggie\\n\\n \u0027peek into my mom\u0027s room as I\u0027m getting ready for the .double date. She\u0027s sitting on her bed, staring at the open box with the ring Lou gave her still inside. She didn\u0027t say yes to him when he came over last night and proposed, but she didn\u0027t say no.\\n\\n She said she needed time to think.\\n\\n She\u0027s definitely thinking.\\n\\n \"Did you tell Dad about Lou?\" I ask her.\\n\\n \"I called him today,\" she says, her voice sad and wistful.\\n\\n \"And?\"\\n\\n \"And ... I don\u0027t know,\" she says, then shrugs. \"I\u0027m confused. I thought I knew what I wanted, but when Lou came by last night he got me thinking, and now ... now I\u0027m just confused.\"\\n\\n I sit on the bed next to her and smile. She brushes the hair out of my face and sighs. \"I thought for so long that if your dad came back, it would make our lives whole again.\"\\n\\n \"I know. I did, too. Until Lou came along.\"\\n\\n \"But he\u0027s not your dad. I fell in love with your dad first, and I don\u0027t know if I can give Lou as much of myself as I gave your father.\"\\n\\n \"He loves you, Mom.\"\\n\\n \"I know. But is it enough?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s for you to decide. I\u0027ll support you, no matter what you choose.\"\\n\\n \"I just thought ... well, forget it. Don\u0027t think about anything except having fun. I\u0027m glad you\u0027re going out.\"\\n\\n \"Me too.\" I hadn\u0027t been looking forward to tonight, but when I took a shower and started getting ready, I got excited. Well, not excited for my mystery date, but excited to be doing what I said I was doing-moving on with my life.\\n\\n Sometimes moving on takes effort.\\n\\n Sometimes moving on is harder than it looks.\\n\\n Going out is the first step to Maggie Armstrong moving on in life. I may have a limp, but that doesn\u0027t mean my social life or dating life has to be dead.\\n\\n I take a deep breath and tell myself, it is what it is. I can\u0027t turn back the clock and undo the accident. It happened. This is who I am now, take it or leave it.\\n\\n But when I look at my clock and notice it\u0027s five fortyfive, I have second thoughts. I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m ready to move on. I can\u0027t imagine myself kissing anyone besides Caleb. I know that\u0027s ridiculous, but right now it\u0027s true.\\n\\n At five after six, as I\u0027m ready to bite my fingernails to the core with anticipation and anxiety, the doorbell rings.\\n\\n I plaster a smile on my face and open the front door. Standing in front of me is Matt, a girl with short spiky blonde hair, and ...\\n\\n \"No way!\" I say with a smile.\\n\\n My physical therapist, Robert, opens his arms wide. \"You didn\u0027t think I\u0027d let you leave for Spain without one last goodbye, did you?\"\\n\\n I narrow my eyes at Matt. \"Did you have this planned all along?\" I ask him, as Robert hugs me like a brother.\\n\\n \"Yeah. So shoot me if we wanted to surprise you. Becca, this is Maggie. Maggie, Becca.\" While I greet Matt\u0027s girlfriend, Matt nudges Robert. \"Maggie even put on makeup for you. I\u0027ve never even seen her with makeup on.\"\\n\\n My mom comes in the foyer, pretending she was just passing through on her way upstairs instead of having it all timed so that she could meet my \"date.\"\\n\\n \"Robert?\" she says, confused.\\n\\n Robert, wearing a fashionable brown sports jacket to match his fashionable glasses says, \"I couldn\u0027t let Maggie leave for an entire year without a goodbye celebration. She\u0027s my date tonight.\"\\n\\n My mom has known Robert for almost two years now, ever since he came to the hospital after my surgery and was assigned to be my personal torture instructor ... I mean physical therapist. I used to fantasize about pulling his perfectly spiked hair right out of his head when he wouldn\u0027t give up on me and I desperately wanted him to.\\n\\n More times than not, I cried in front of him. I hated when Robert expected me to push myself to the limit. When I thought I couldn\u0027t bend my leg any more, Robert would make me go one step further.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t appreciate him at the time, that\u0027s for sure. It took us a while to become friends. I was actually entertained by all of his stories about dating girls. Robert is a self-proclaimed bachelor and says he\u0027ll never settle down because he gets bored easily when it comes to girls. He says just like he can\u0027t eat Chinese food every day, he can\u0027t date the same girl without getting the itch to find someone different.\\n\\n I once told him he\u0027d die a very lonely man, and his good looks would one day fade, but he didn\u0027t seem worried. The guy has way too much confidence, but I wouldn\u0027t trade him for anything.\\n\\n After my mom hugs Robert and meets Matt and Becca, she says, \"You kids stay out at long as you want. Just have fun.\"\\n\\n We decide to go to Dusty\u0027s Sports Bar \u0026 Grill. They serve food in the restaurant, so as long as you don\u0027t drink, you can be there if you\u0027re under twenty-one. Robert is already twenty-four, and he orders a beer while the rest of us order sodas.\\n\\n It\u0027s nice that my first real date is a nondate, so I don\u0027t have to obsess over whether or not my disability is going to be an issue.\\n\\n \"Maggie, have you been doing the stretching exercises we\u0027d discussed before you went on your trip this summer?\" Robert asks.\\n\\n I take a fry from the basket we\u0027d ordered and dip it in some ketchup. \"Can I lie?\"\\n\\n Matt, Becca, and I all laugh while Robert shakes his head. It feels good to go out and get my mind off of Caleb. I feel like every minute my mind isn\u0027t occupied, it wanders to thoughts of him.\\n\\n Like now. While I\u0027m having a good time, way better than I expected, I wonder if Caleb would have his arm around me like Matt has his arm draped around Becca, if we were on a date. And the way she looks up at him reminds me of-\\n\\n \"I bet you\u0027ve been stiff,\" Robert says.\\n\\n Right. Back to the here and now. Stop thinking about Caleb.\\n\\n I roll my eyes. \"You\u0027re off duty. Remember, you\u0027re supposed to be my date tonight, not my therapist.\" My fingers make quotation marks in the air when I say the word \"date.\"\\n\\n \"She did complain of stiffness on the trip,\" Matt chimes in. He holds his hands up when I mumble traitor. \"I\u0027m just sayin\u0027.\"\\n\\n Robert moves his chair back and says, \"Give me your leg, Maggie.\"\\n\\n I blow out a frustrated breath and rest my leg on his knee. \"It\u0027s fine. I\u0027m fine.\"\\n\\n \"Flex for me.\"\\n\\n I look over at Matt and Becca across the table as I flex. \"Better you than me,\" Matt says, chuckling.\\n\\n \"Do you give a physical exam to all your dates?\" I ask Robert as he cradles my jean-covered calf in his hand and watches how far I flex.\\n\\n \"No.\" He winks at me. \"It\u0027s a first for me.\"\\n\\n If it were any other guy, that wink would be cheesy, but I bet Robert practiced it in front of the mirror until it looked cool.\\n\\n I cock an eyebrow and say, \"I don\u0027t fall for your charms.\"\\n\\n \"Really? Wait, let me try it again.\" He winks a second time.\\n\\n \"Nope, doesn\u0027t do it for me. Besides, it\u0027s really inappropriate,\" I tell him, totally joking and he knows it. He\u0027s given me such a hard time in the past, I feel it\u0027s only fair for me to return the favor. \"I\u0027m your patient.\"\\n\\n \"Not anymore, you\u0027re not. You quit physical therapy. You\u0027re fair game.\"\\n\\n \"Ugh, you\u0027re too old.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m twenty-four. How can that be too old?\"\\n\\n \"I think you have some gray hair, Robert.\"\\n\\n Robert\u0027s mouth goes wide and his hand cups his perfect head of hair. \"I. Do. Not.\"\\n\\n \"Umm, Maggie,\" Matt says, then coughs a bunch of times. \"I think the guy you really want just walked through the door.\"\\n\\n TWENTY-NINE\\n\\n Caleb\\n\\n \u0027m trying to act like seeing Maggie with another guy is no big deal. I\u0027ve wanted to call her since I came back. I should have called her. I didn\u0027t, and now she\u0027s out with a guy. She\u0027s got her leg resting on his knee, her calf cradled in his slimy hand.\\n\\n What the fuck?\\n\\n Does the dude know that a week ago she was lying in bed with me?\\n\\n When Maggie looks my way, she whisks her leg off the guy\u0027s lap.\\n\\n \"Maggie! Matt!\" Lenny practically yells across the bar. He\u0027s standing next to me, waving his arms as if he\u0027s on a desert island attempting to flag down a passing ship. Nobody\u0027s missing his presence, that\u0027s for damn sure. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/return-to-paradise-leaving-paradise-2/page-23.html","bookId":2772,"book":{"id":2772,"title":"Return to Paradise (Leaving Paradise #2)","description":"Storyline: Return to Paradise (Leaving Paradise #2) \\n Caleb Becker left Paradise eight months ago, taking with him the secret he promised to take to his grave.
