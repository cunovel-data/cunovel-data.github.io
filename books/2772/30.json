{"id":86677,"no":30,"title":"Page 30","content":"I wait ten minutes, staring up at the tree and wondering why he wanted me to wait here and how long he wants me to wait. Just as I\u0027m starting to feel insecure, I see a silhouette running toward me.\n I\u0027d recognize Caleb anywhere. My heart soars.\n \"Maggie!\"\n He stands in front of me, toe-to-toe, totally out of breath. He\u0027s wearing ripped jeans and a stained white T-shirt. He looks like he hasn\u0027t shaved in a week, and his hair is disheveled.\n \"I\u0027m so sorry I\u0027m late.\" He reaches out and fingers my hair, which is long now since I haven\u0027t cut it in almost a year. \"You look great, Maggie. Different.\"\n \"Thanks,\" I say. \"You do, too.\"\n I reach up and put my arms around his neck, not caring that I\u0027m being bold. I don\u0027t want to hold back. \"I missed you,\" I tell him.\n His hands go around my waist and he pulls me close. \"I have so many questions to ask you. But first...\"\n I think we\u0027re going to kiss, but instead he pulls something out of his pocket and holds it up. It\u0027s a bandanna.\n \"What\u0027s that for?\" I ask.\n \"Turn around.\"\n I cock an eyebrow.\n \"Trust me, Maggie.\"\n I do as he says. \"I was going to kiss you,\" I tell him.\n He gently positions the bandanna over my eyes and ties it in the back. \"You will. I promise. Just ... be patient.\"\n I\u0027m not patient.\n While I was in Spain, my feelings for Caleb grew infinitely stronger. I had guy friends my roommate and I would go out with, but none of them made me shiver with excitement. I get excited just thinking about being in Caleb\u0027s arms again.\n \"I can\u0027t see anything,\" I announce as I\u0027m led across the park and into a car.\n \"That\u0027s pretty much the point, sweetheart.\"\n I feel us winding through streets until we come to a stop. He opens the door and leads me out of the car. He chuckles as he puts his hands on my waist and urges me forward to who knows where.\n \"Where are we?\" I ask, wondering how long it will be before the suspense is over.\n \"You\u0027ll know soon enough. Okay, stop.\"\n \"Can I take the blindfold off?\"\n \"Nope. Not yet.\" In one swift movement, Caleb picks me up and cradles me in his arms.\n I wrap my arms around his neck for support. \"The last time you held me like this you dunked me in water.\"\n He walks forward. \"Trust me, Maggie.\"\n \"I do. But I\u0027ve got to be honest and say you smell like a sweaty guy from the gym.\"\n \"I\u0027ve been working. I promise to take a shower after I show you something.\n He walks a little more, then suddenly stops. \"Okay, pull off the blindfold.\"\n When I do, I realize where we are immediately. In Mrs. Reynolds\u0027 gazebo. The entire floor is covered in cushions and little twinkling lights outline the perimeter. On top of the cushions are thousands of little white and red rose petals.\n \"It\u0027s perfect,\" I say breathlessly as I slide my sandals off and walk onto the cushions. \"Where are Lenny and Julio?\" I ask. I know Lou took the house off the market and pretty much considers it a haven for Caleb and his friends. As long as they\u0027re employed and don\u0027t get in trouble, they\u0027ve got a roof over their head.\n \"I told them to sleep out tonight. Tonight I wanted to be alone with you.\"\n I swallow, hard. \"Alone?\" Racy thoughts a girl shouldn\u0027t have clutter my mind. I smile. \"Really?\"\n \"Yeah. It\u0027s been so damn long I was afraid you were gonna return to Paradise and tell me you never wanted to see me again.\"\n \"I was afraid of the same thing about you,\" I admit.\n We both laugh, and for some reason it makes me feel better that we\u0027re both cautious and nervous.\n \"Have you seen Kendra and Brian\u0027s new baby recently?\" I ask. He told me he\u0027s been going out with Brian and his high school buddies on occasion.\n \"Yeah. Cute kid, although I\u0027ve got a feeling Kendra\u0027s gonna raise her as a little diva.\"\n \"How\u0027s their relationship?\" I ask.\n \"Rocky, but they\u0027re trying. Last time I saw Kendra, she hardly spoke to me. I suspect she realizes I\u0027m not looking at her like she\u0027s the goddess she wants everyone to think she is.\"\n \"Good.\"\n \"Maggie, I want to tell you something,\" he says in a serious tone, as we settle down into the plush cushions.\n I shake my head. \"No. Let me say what I have to say first.\" This is not going to be easy. I take a deep breath, gathering the courage to put everything on the line. There are things that I\u0027ve held back because I was scared, but I learned something in Spain this year. One of my professors said if you tiptoe into cold water, you\u0027re missing out on the rush of plunging in headfirst.\n I\u0027m going to plunge in, without worrying about the consequences. I look at Caleb, at the twinkling lights, and at the beautiful petals surrounding us.\n \"I\u0027ve been holding back because I\u0027ve been scared. You can crush my heart like my dad did with my mom. You have power over me.\" A tear escapes my eye. \"I still love you, Caleb. I fell in love with you right here in this backyard, and I never stopped. Being apart this year hasn\u0027t changed anything.\"\n Caleb looks around, as if he\u0027s thinking of something to say but doesn\u0027t know how to put it into words. \"Ever since we got locked in Mrs. Reynolds\u0027 attic, I knew I\u0027d been missing out on a girl who really cared about me and wasn\u0027t self-absorbed. I was so blind for so long.\"\n \"What happens when I leave for college in the fall?\"\n \"I\u0027ll come visit you whenever I can. U of I isn\u0027t far away.\" He touches my nose. \"I want to kiss you, but I need to take a quick shower first.\" Hopping up off the cushions, Caleb starts walking toward the house. \"Just ... wait here and don\u0027t move until I get back. I have a surprise for you,\" he says with a nervous edge to his voice.\n I\u0027m confused, but I promise not to move until he comes back. I lean back on the cushions. It\u0027s just right, being back in Paradise with Caleb again. I know he\u0027s working construction and trying to save up for college. He can do it. I\u0027m sure of it.\n He comes back ten minutes later, all cleaned up. His shirt outlines his arm muscles, which are bigger since the last time I saw him. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s from working construction all day.\n He looks at me with an intense expression. In the past, every time I caught him looking at me like that, I wanted to pinch myself. I thought the only way Caleb Becker would ever look at me like that was if I was dreaming or if he had an agenda.\n I don\u0027t know when the switch happened. I think it was after Kendra stayed late at his house, talking. Afterward, he told me to trust him and asked me to be his girlfriend.\n That was the moment.\n The side of his mouth quirks up. \"What\u0027re you thinking about?\"\n \"You.\"\n \"I hope it\u0027s good.\"\n I smile. \"It is.\" I pat the cushions. We still haven\u0027t kissed, and I\u0027m not interested in being patient right now. In fact, at this point I\u0027d have no problem kissing a sweaty, rugged, smelly Caleb. \"Come sit with me.\"\n Instead of sitting with me, he holds out his hand. \"I have a surprise for you.\"\n He helps me up and hands me what looks like a remote control switch.\n \"You\u0027re not going to blindfold me again, are you?\" I ask.\n \"No.\" He leads me behind the garage. I can barely see the outline of some kind of big structure. I can\u0027t make out what it is. Standing behind me, his arms holding me tight, Caleb whispers, \"Push the button.\"\n When I do, the entire structure lights up with twinkling lights ... in the outline of... \"A castle?\"\n A castle. A bigger version of that castle on the playground.\n \"I was finishing up the last-minute touches when your plane landed and lost track of time,\" Caleb says.\n I can\u0027t believe I didn\u0027t notice it before. I don\u0027t know what to say... \"It\u0027s a castle. I can\u0027t believe you made me a castle.\"\n He takes my hand and leads me inside the structure. There are more petals strewn all over the wooden floor, surrounding a bunch of pillows and blankets in the middle.\n \"This is like heaven,\" I murmur as I look up into the open sky above us. It\u0027s just like it was at the park, but this is better. This time we aren\u0027t running away from anything or anyone.\n Caleb sits down on the pillows. \"Heaven, huh?\"\n \"Definitely.\" I\u0027m in shock as I sink down next to him. \"This is amazing, Caleb. Did you build it yourself?\"\n \"Lenny and Julio helped, but I designed it.\"\n I look at the boy-turned-man who\u0027s the love of my life. I fish out a little box from my purse and hand it to him. \"Here. It\u0027s a gift I brought back for you.\"\n As he takes the top off and peers inside, I add, \"I took a jewelry-making class.\" He pulls out the leather string and attached pendant. \"It\u0027s a sword,\" I tell him.\n He laughs. \"I can tell what it is. It\u0027s really cool. I like it.\" He hangs it around his neck. I like that he\u0027s wearing something I made for him.\n \"It symbolizes strength,\" I say. \"It reminds me of you.\"\n In a surprise move, Caleb kneels in front of me. My heart just about leaps out of my chest.\n He clears his throat.\n He takes a deep breath and straightens his shoulders. \"Okay, here\u0027s the deal. It was hell being apart from you this past year. Every day there was something that I did that reminded me of you.\"\n I hold his face in my hands. When my lips are a whisper away from his, I ask, \"Do you think we\u0027ll make it, Caleb? Do you think we\u0027ll last?\"\n \"We\u0027ve been to hell and back again. We\u0027re gonna make it. I love you, Maggie Armstrong, and always will.\"\n \"You promise?\"\n We lie back on the pillows together, and he places small, slow kisses across my neck. \"Trust me,\" he whispers against my lips. \"Maggie, you\u0027re my paradise.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/return-to-paradise-leaving-paradise-2/page-30.html","bookId":2772,"book":{"id":2772,"title":"Return to Paradise (Leaving Paradise #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Return to Paradise (Leaving Paradise #2) \n Caleb Becker left Paradise eight months ago, taking with him the secret he promised to take to his grave.
