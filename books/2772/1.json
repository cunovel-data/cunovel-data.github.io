{"id":86648,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"ONE\n Caleb\n ome people are damn lucky. Unfortunately I\u0027ve never been one of those people. In fact, I think I\u0027m one of those guys destined to always be caught in the crossfire. As I sit in the back of a squad car with handcuffs digging into my wrists, I think back to the first time I got arrested, almost two years ago.\n I\u0027d been drinking.\n I was wasted.\n And I was arrested for a crime I didn\u0027t commit.\n Didn\u0027t matter, though. I got locked in juvie for a year anyway, mostly because I pled guilty to the hit-and-run drunk driving charges.\n This time I\u0027m getting arrested for drugs. Except I didn\u0027t smoke, inhale, ingest, snort, shoot up, or buy the shit. Okay, I admit I was living in a drug house. It was either keep a roof over my head and ignore the illegal stuff going on around me, or live on the streets.\n I chose the roof. Looking back, maybe it wasn\u0027t the wisest choice. Living on the streets sounds mighty tempting right now. Nothing is worse than being locked up like a caged animal and relinquishing control of your own life. Being told when to shit, shower, shave, eat, and sleep isn\u0027t my idea of paradise. But then again, Paradise, where I grew up, wasn\u0027t paradise either. I\u0027m wondering if paradise is just some word in the dictionary with the definition: this doesn\u0027t fucking exist.\n I lean my head against the back seat of the squad car, wondering how I\u0027m gonna get out of this. I have no money, no real friends, and my family ... well, I haven\u0027t had any contact with them since I left Paradise eight months ago.\n When we arrive at the police station, the cop escorts me to a lady who has the exciting job of taking my mug shot. Then the cop orders me to his desk and introduces himself as Lieutenant Ramsey.\n \"Don\u0027t try anything stupid,\" he tells me as he unlocks the handcuff on my right wrist and secures it to a metal hook on his desk so if I wanted to flee I\u0027d have to lug a fifty-pound desk with me. Needless to say, I\u0027m not going anywhere.\n After asking me a bunch of questions, he leaves me alone. I look around for Rio, one of my five roommates. We all got busted at the same time, when Rio and another one of our roommates were selling a crapload of meth to three guys who, if you ask me, looked like undercover cops who were just dressed up as badass gangsters. I think it was the gold tooth on one of the guys that gave it away. It looked like it\u0027d been glued on and I could have sworn it became loose at one point and he swallowed it.\n That was right before they pulled out their guns and yelled for us to kneel on the ground and put our hands on our heads. I\u0027d been watching some reality show about a pawn shop, because the last thing I needed was to be involved in Rio\u0027s business.\n Rio had asked me to help him make some runs a couple times, and I did. But I don\u0027t get off on selling drugs to guys who\u0027re so desperate to get high they\u0027ll give me their last dime to get it. The last time I was supposed to sell drugs for Rio, it was to a guy with three kids. He brought his three kids to our house, and when I saw their long, drawn faces and their ragged, torn clothes, I couldn\u0027t do it. I refused to sell him the stuff. Not that that makes me a good person or anything, especially because I know if I didn\u0027t sell it to him someone else would.\n \"Listen, Caleb,\" Ramsey says as he opens up a file folder with my name on the tab at the top. \"You\u0027ve got yourself in big trouble. Chicago judges aren\u0027t lenient on repeaters, especially when they\u0027re living in drug houses with over fifty thousand worth of meth and Z-tabs.\"\n \"I\u0027m not a dealer,\" I tell him. \"I work at Chicago Recycling.\"\n \"Just because you\u0027ve got a job doesn\u0027t mean you don\u0027t deal.\" He picks up his phone and hands me the receiver. \"You get one phone call. Tell me what number to dial.\"\n I put the receiver down on his desk. \"I waive my right to a call.\"\n \"Family? Friends?\" he suggests.\n I shake my head. \"Don\u0027t got any.\"\n Ramsey rests the handset back on the phone. \"Don\u0027t you want someone to bail you out? The judge\u0027ll set bail later today or tomorrow. You should be prepared.\"\n When I don\u0027t respond, he flips through my file. He looks up after a couple of minutes. \"It says here Damon Manning was your transition counselor.\"\n Damon Manning was supposed to make sure I stayed out of trouble back when I got released from juvie. He was a big black guy who scared my mom to death when he walked in our house during his scheduled visits. Damon assigned me my community service job and constantly drilled me on how to transition from being in jail to being back at home. He wouldn\u0027t take one-word responses or silence for an answer. The guy was a hardass who didn\u0027t take shit from anyone, and whenever I fucked up he let me know I better shape up or he would be personally responsible for telling the judge to lock me back up. I had no doubt that he\u0027d do it, too.\n Ramsey jots a number down and sets it in front of me.\n \"What\u0027s this?\"\n \"Damon Manning\u0027s phone number.\"\n \"And why would I want it?\" I ask him.\n \"If you don\u0027t have family or friends to bail you out, I suggest you call him.\"\n I shake my head and say, \"No way.\"\n Ramsey pushes the phone toward me and leans back in his chair. \"Call him. If you don\u0027t, I will.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"Because I read Damon\u0027s reports on you, and he\u0027s rarely wrong about his assessments.\"\n \"What did he write?\" That I was a complete fuckup who deserved to be locked up permanently?\n \"Why don\u0027t you call him and ask him yourself? You\u0027re in big trouble, Caleb. You need someone on your side right now.\"\n I look at the phone and shake my head in frustration. Ramsey doesn\u0027t look like he\u0027s giving me a choice. I pick up the phone and dial the number.\n \"This is Damon,\" a deep voice answers.\n I clear my throat. \"Umm ... this is Caleb. Caleb Becker.\"\n \"Why are you callin\u0027 me?\"\n \"I kind of got in trouble,\" I say, then clear my throat. I take a deep breath and reluctantly blurt out, \"I need your help.\"\n \"Help? I didn\u0027t know you knew that word.\"\n I briefly explain the situation. He sighs heavily a bunch of times, but says he\u0027s on his way over to the station. After my call, I\u0027m escorted to a holding cell and wait for him. An hour later I\u0027m told I have a visitor and am led to what I assume is one of the interrogation rooms. Oh, man. If things weren\u0027t bad enough, I have a feeling they\u0027re about to get worse as a very pissed-off Damon walks through the metal bulletproof door.\n \"What the hell did you get yourself into, Becker?\"\n \"A shitload of trouble,\" I tell him.\n Damon crosses his arms on his chest. \"I could have sworn you were a guy who made one mistake and was going to turn his life around.\" He gets a distant, almost sad look on his face, but it\u0027s quickly masked. \"I got to admit you reminded me of myself when I was your age.\"\n \"Yeah, well, you were obviously wrong.\"\n He narrows his eyes at me. \"Was l?\"\n This isn\u0027t the way it was supposed to be. I left Paradise to make everything better, but all I\u0027ve managed to do is fuck things up for myself. I look Damon straight in the eye. \"I didn\u0027t do it,\" I tell him. \"I\u0027m not a dealer.\"\n \"Why should I believe you?\"\n \"Because it\u0027s the truth.\" I let out a breath, knowing it\u0027s a lost cause to plead my case but doing it anyway. \"I don\u0027t expect you to believe me.\"\n \"Have you lied to me in the past?\"\n I nod.\n \"About what?\"\n I close my eyes and shake my head. I can\u0027t tell Damon that I wasn\u0027t the one who hit Maggie. I told Leah I\u0027d take that secret to the grave. I can\u0027t betray my own twin. Not now, and not ever. \"Forget it.\"\n \"You\u0027re on the wrong path,\" Damon tells me.\n \"I didn\u0027t have a choice.\" I let out a long, slow breath and decide to level with him. About some stuff, anyway. \"I found out my mom was addicted to meds. I think me being home made it worse. She kept expecting me to fake it that everything was okay. My entire family went along with the bullshit. I couldn\u0027t. Maggie was the only one keeping me sane, but I couldn\u0027t see her without getting shit from the cops, my parents, her mom, and even you. You once said I should get out of Paradise instead of getting close to Maggie. So now I\u0027m here.\"\n \"Living with a drug dealer isn\u0027t a better option,\" Damon says, stating the obvious.\n \"It was a roof over my head.\"\n \"There are always options other than living with thugs,\" Damon tells me.\n \"Yeah, right.\" I look down at the red mark the handcuffs left on my skin. I seem to be all out of options right now.\n \"I\u0027m really disappointed in you.\"\n Disappointed is better than angry. I\u0027ve seen Damon angry. He stiffens up like a bull with a thorn up his ass. Hell, when I got suspended from school for fighting, Damon looked ready to single-handedly kick my ass. The guy is huge and must weigh close to two-eighty. I\u0027m not a lightweight, but he could sit on me and crush my bones.\n \"I\u0027ll be right back,\" Damon says, then leaves me alone in the room.\n Ramsey comes back a half hour later, with Damon following in his wake. The officer sits on the edge of the small table in the room and looks down at me. \"You\u0027re lucky, kid.\"\n I\u0027m about to be tossed in jail. I\u0027m not feeling lucky right about now.\n \"I just talked to Judge Hanson,\" Damon says. \"You\u0027ll have your arraignment this afternoon, and I\u0027ll pay any bail set. I\u0027m friends with the district attorney who\u0027ll help you.\"\n \"Why would you do that for me?\" I ask.\n \"Because someone did it for me a while back. There\u0027s one condition,\" he says.\n Here it comes. The ax is about to fall. \"What?\"\n My ex-transition counselor has a stern look on his face. \"You join Re-START.\"\n \"What\u0027s that?\"\n \"It\u0027s a group of kids whose lives have been affected by reckless teen driving. We\u0027re traveling for a month together, and each participant shares their story with various groups of kids in the Midwest. We\u0027ll be roughing it, so don\u0027t expect fancy hotels or the royal treatment. We\u0027ll be staying in dorms and campgrounds. This arrest isn\u0027t about drugs, Caleb. It\u0027s a direct result of your accident in Paradise. Join the program and help others. If you don\u0027t agree to come with me, I\u0027m out of here. If I leave, I have no doubt they\u0027ll lock you up for good and throw away the key. You\u0027re eigh teen now. If you thought juvie was awful, I guarantee that adult lockup will be one hundred times worse.\"\n \"So I really don\u0027t have a choice?\"\n \"You do. Stay here and enjoy the fine hospitality of our state prisons, or get off your ass and follow me.\"\n So there isn\u0027t a choice. One of the options is something I\u0027d do practically anything to avoid. Even if it includes spending time with my old transition counselor.\n We don\u0027t speak much the entire one-and-a-half-hour drive out to Redwood. He tries to ask me questions and I do my best to dodge them. When we pull up the driveway of a one-story duplex, he explains, \"You\u0027ll sleep at my place tonight, and meet up with the rest of the group tomorrow afternoon.\"\n Inside, I drop my duffle next to a faded plaid couch. On the mantle above the empty fireplace is a picture of Damon with a little boy, about eight years old, in a Little League uniform.\n \"Is he yours?\" I ask him, wondering how this guy ended up living alone in a small town in the middle of the boondocks of Illinois. Paradise isn\u0027t too far away from here. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/return-to-paradise-leaving-paradise-2/page-1.html","bookId":2772,"book":{"id":2772,"title":"Return to Paradise (Leaving Paradise #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Return to Paradise (Leaving Paradise #2) \n Caleb Becker left Paradise eight months ago, taking with him the secret he promised to take to his grave.
