{"id":86654,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"Thank goodness Damon ordered Caleb to sit in the passenger seat. I don\u0027t think he\u0027s too happy with Caleb right now. I\u0027m not, either.\\n\\n We park at Dixon Hall, one of the Freeman University dorms. It\u0027s across from a big brick library with floorto-ceiling windows.\\n\\n Damon leads us to a suite on the second floor of the dorm. It\u0027s got a kitchen with a table, and two couches in the common living room area. \"Girls in that bedroom,\" Damon says as he points to a door. \"Guys in the other.\" He smiles as he tosses his suitcase into the third room, closest to the couches. \"I get this room for myself.\"\\n\\n \"How long are we staying here?\" Matt asks.\\n\\n \"This will be our home base for a while,\" Damon tells him. \"We\u0027ll be taking day trips from here.\"\\n\\n \"My face hurts,\" Lenny complains. \"And it itches.\" He resembles a mime, with all the white cream the nurse put on him from his sunburn and bites. He walks up to Trish and sticks his face close to hers. \"Scratch me.\"\\n\\n Trish sneers at him, looking like she\u0027d rather die than touch his cream-covered face. \"Get out of my face, you freak.\"\\n\\n \"Enough, you two,\" Damon says sternly. \"Trish, I\u0027m not fond of name-calling. Lenny, if you\u0027ve got an itch, scratch it yourself please.\"\\n\\n Erin looks like she\u0027s going to throw up just looking at Lenny\u0027s cream-colored face.\\n\\n Lenny walks to the window overlooking the grassy courtyard below \"Check this out, Caleb! Hot college chicks laying out in bikinis.\"\\n\\n Ignoring him, Caleb heads for the guys\u0027 bedroom with his duffle.\\n\\n \"Get settled, guys,\" Damon says as he walks into his own room. \"I want to have a group meeting in a half hour.\"\\n\\n \"Great,\" Caleb mutters sarcastically from the doorway to the guys\u0027 room. \"Just what I need.\"\\n\\n Damon swings around. \"You do need it. And before you ask to get out of it, you\u0027ll participate just like everyone else.\" His tone makes clear this is nonnegotiable.\\n\\n Trish, Erin, and I pick our beds in the girls\u0027 room.\\n\\n \"Erin, how come you don\u0027t talk?\" Trish demands.\\n\\n Erin shrugs as she unpacks her suitcase and hangs her clothes in the small closet.\\n\\n \"You know this trip is supposed to be about sharing your experiences, right? What did you do, besides get too many tattoos on your arms?\"\\n\\n Erin doesn\u0027t answer. She fidgets with a shirt she\u0027s trying to fold and put in one of the drawers.\\n\\n \"Leave her alone, Trish,\" I say. \"She\u0027ll talk when she wants to.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, if that\u0027s the way it\u0027s gonna be, that\u0027s fine,\" Trish says, giving up. \"But just so you know, I\u0027m not gonna pretend to be all buddy-buddy if you hold back on me.\"\\n\\n I think Erin will stay silent like usual, until her hands still and she turns to us. Her eyes are glassy, as if she\u0027s holding back tears.\\n\\n \"My boyfriend is in jail for three years for killing someone in a drive-by. My parents kicked me out of the house. And...\" She wipes at her eyes and says in a soft voice, \"I\u0027m pregnant.\"\\n\\n \"Holy crap,\" Trish says. \"No wonder you don\u0027t talk.\"\\n\\n I elbow Trish in the ribs, hoping she\u0027ll get the hint and not say anything that will upset Erin. She\u0027s pregnant? With a boy who\u0027ll be in jail for three years? Hearing her story makes my problem with Caleb seem about as important as a hangnail.\\n\\n \"If you need anything, we\u0027re here for you,\" I tell her. \"Right, Trish?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" Trish is quick to say. I think Erin just earned Trish\u0027s loyalty by sharing her story. Maybe Trish practically forcing Erin to talk was a good thing.\\n\\n \"And what about you?\" Trish says, turning to me.\\n\\n I lift my head from my suitcase. I must look like a deer in headlights. \"What about me? I told my story at the campfire last night.\"\\n\\n \"Not about the accident. Caleb said something today about you and him in a gazebo. Care to go into details?\"\\n\\n I quickly shake my head. \"Maybe later. We don\u0027t want to be late for Damon\u0027s meeting.\" I shove a stack of my clothes into a drawer.\\n\\n \"I think you\u0027re stalling.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re right, Trish,\" I say. \"I don\u0027t want to talk about it.\\n\\n \"Suit yourself.\" Trish opens the closet door and looks confused. \"Wait, where\u0027s the bathroom?\" she asks as she holds out a plastic bag with her toiletries.\\n\\n \"In the common area, I guess,\" Erin offers. \"We\u0027re probably sharing one.\"\\n\\n Trish shakes her head as if she heard wrong. \"No way. All seven of us can\u0027t share one bathroom.\"\\n\\n She hurries out to the common area to investigate. Erin and I follow her. Sure enough, there\u0027s a bathroom between the guys\u0027 room and Damon\u0027s room.\\n\\n Damon comes out of his room. \"What\u0027s going on?\"\\n\\n \"Damon, did you know there\u0027s only one bathroom for all seven of us?\" Trish asks.\\n\\n Damon shakes his head. \"That\u0027s not true.\"\\n\\n You can feel the sigh of relief from Trish, Erin, and I ... until Damon says, \"I have my own bathroom. Only the six of you have to share one.\"\\n\\n Trish puts her hands on her hips. \"That\u0027s not fair.\"\\n\\n Damon chuckles. \"Didn\u0027t anyone tell you that nothing in life is fair, Trish?\"\\n\\n She peeks her head inside the common bathroom. \"Eww!\" She points to the toilet. \"The seat is up. And there are little droplets of pee and stray pubes on the ring. That\u0027s not okay.\"\\n\\n As if on cue, all three guys join us. \"What\u0027s the problem?\" Matt asks Trish.\\n\\n \"The problem is that six of us have to share a bathroom.\" She glares in the direction of our leader. \"And Prince Damon gets his own throne to sit on.\"\\n\\n \"This isn\u0027t a luxury hotel,\" Lenny informs Trish. \"Anyway, what\u0027s wrong with the bathroom? It looked fine to me.\\n\\n Trish gets in Lenny\u0027s face. \"So you\u0027re the culprit. You were in the bathroom.\"\\n\\n Lenny shrugs. \"So what if I was?\"\\n\\n \"Haven\u0027t you ever heard the phrase, If you sprinkle when you tinkle please be neat and wipe the seat? That goes for stray pubes, as well.\"\\n\\n \"Haven\u0027t you ever heard the phrase, Shut the fuck up, bitch?\" Lenny fires back.\\n\\n \"I think it\u0027s time we have our meeting,\" Damon says. \"Right now.\"\\n\\n I avoid eye contact with Caleb as I pick a seat on one of the couches. Trish and Erin sit on either side of me. The guys sit on the opposite couch from the girls.\\n\\n Damon pulls over a chair from the kitchen table. He takes a deep breath and claps his hands. \"Okay, kids, here\u0027s the deal. Some rules have to be set, \u0027cause you guys are drivin\u0027 me nuts. First of all, let\u0027s try to eliminate the profanity flying out of your mouths. Second, there\u0027s to be no consumption of drugs or alcohol. We\u0027re on a college cam pus and I\u0027ve no doubt they\u0027re easy to find. Third, I\u0027m tired of the bickering. It\u0027s giving me a headache.\"\\n\\n \"But-\" Trish starts to say, but Damon holds a hand up and stops her from talking.\\n\\n \"About the bathroom situation. You all have to share the one bathroom. Deal with it. There\u0027s another bathroom at the end of the hall right next to the elevators if you need it. Guys, put the seat down after you do your thing. Girls, make sure there are no feminine products lying around. Are all we all cool about that?\"\\n\\n We all nod.\\n\\n \"Where are the air-conditioning controls?\" Lenny asks. \"I\u0027m sweating my butt off in this sauna.\"\\n\\n \"There is no air conditioning, Lenny. Like you pointed out, this isn\u0027t a luxury hotel. Any more questions?\"\\n\\n When nobody answers, Damon says, \"Great.\" He sighs as if a weight has been lifted off him. \"Now that that\u0027s settled, I\u0027ve got one more thing. We had some drama this morning thanks to Caleb, and I want to talk about it.\"\\n\\n \"How \u0027bout we don\u0027t talk about it,\" Caleb mumbles. \"Hell, I\u0027d rather talk about Lenny\u0027s pubes.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d rather talk about Lenny\u0027s pubic hair loss issues, too. It\u0027s better than having Caleb and me actually talk about our past ... or talk to one another. I\u0027m not going to do it. Not now, when his insults are so raw.\\n\\n A wave of numbness washes over me. I stand. \"I\u0027m sorry, Damon. I just can\u0027t. I don\u0027t mean to disrespect this group, or this process. I just ... need time.\"\\n\\n I intentionally look away from Caleb and I\u0027m all too aware of my limp and his nearness as I head to my room and close the door. I don\u0027t lock it, though, since I\u0027m sharing it with two other girls.\\n\\n When I hear a knock as I sit on my bed, I flinch.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Matt. Can I come in?\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\"\\n\\n Matt opens the door. \"Wanna talk?\"\\n\\n \"Not really. Is Damon mad?\"\\n\\n \"No. He wanted to see if you were okay, but I volunteered to come instead.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" I mumble. \"I feel bad I just left in the middle of the meeting.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t feel bad,\" he tells me. \"I think everyone understands. Well, except Caleb.\"\\n\\n \"Why? What did he say?\"\\n\\n Matt comes in the room and stands beside my bed. \"He didn\u0027t say anything. He just got up and walked out.\"\\n\\n NINE\\n\\n Caleb\\n\\n wish Damon hadn\u0027t followed me out of the suite. I hear his thundering footsteps behind me before he grabs my shoulder and pulls me around to face him.\\n\\n \"Leave me alone,\" I tell him, my fists tight and ready to lash out.\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t just leave every time the going gets tough, Caleb.\"\\n\\n \"Watch me,\" I say roughly as a couple of college guys pass us.\\n\\n \"You want out of the program? You want to go to jail?\"\\n\\n \"Is that a threat?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t test me, Caleb. And give me a damn break. I\u0027ve got to deal with Trish and Lenny. That alone could give a guy a coronary.\\n\\n I let out a breath and look away from him. \"Give me a damn break, man. I just want to be alone.\"\\n\\n \"Being alone isn\u0027t good.\"\\n\\n \"It is for me.\" It\u0027s better than watching Matt and Maggie start a relationship right in front of my eyes. The way he ran after her when she fled from the lounge made me sick. I don\u0027t blame the guy ... but I sure as hell don\u0027t need to see it. \"I\u0027m stuck here, I get it. I don\u0027t have a choice. But can you give me a night off from being around everyone? One night, Damon. It won\u0027t kill you ... or me.\" I let out a breath and say quietly, \"Please.\"\\n\\n My transition counselor, the guy who\u0027s always been a hardass and whose job was to force me on the straight and narrow, steps back. \"Fine.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m shocked. Maybe I didn\u0027t hear right. \"What does that mean?\"\\n\\n \"It means I\u0027ll give you a pass ... for tonight; a pass to be alone and figure things out. I\u0027m taking the rest of the group to dinner with a local youth group and then to a movie.\"\\n\\n A night without having to be stoic and pretend I\u0027m a rock is a fucking miracle. A night without having to share my secrets makes me feel like a free man. \"Thanks,\" I say.\\n\\n \"No problem. But tomorrow I expect you to put a damn smile on that mug of yours and suck it up. Got it?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. Yeah, I got it.\"\\n\\n Feeling like the noose is loosened, I follow Damon back to the suite. Maybe I should apologize to Maggie for this morning. I knew I\u0027d hurt her with the gazebo comment. We\u0027d made out like crazy that night. Nobody knew about our secret time together except maybe old Mrs. Reynolds, who\u0027d gone to bed after dinner. I think she knew Maggie and I were getting it on, and I\u0027ve got a feeling she didn\u0027t care. Hell, maybe in a way it helped us get over all the shit we\u0027d been going through. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/return-to-paradise-leaving-paradise-2/page-7.html","bookId":2772,"book":{"id":2772,"title":"Return to Paradise (Leaving Paradise #2)","description":"Storyline: Return to Paradise (Leaving Paradise #2) \\n Caleb Becker left Paradise eight months ago, taking with him the secret he promised to take to his grave.
