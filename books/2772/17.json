{"id":86664,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"When I explain how I didn\u0027t fit in when I came back to start my senior year of high school, she asks, \"Is that sup posed to make me feel sorry for you? Listen, I\u0027ve got more to deal with than a busted-up leg. My dad\u0027s a drunk, and my mom walked out on us five years ago. I\u0027m not really crying over your limp, so you might as well save your breath and the rest of your story for someone who actually gives a shit.\" I didn\u0027t get much sleep last night. Caleb\u0027s not talking to me. I\u0027m crabby and my nerves are on edge. If this girl doesn\u0027t want to have sympathy, fine. But that doesn\u0027t mean I have to sit here while she patronizes me. You listen,\" I say, then lean across the table so I\u0027ve got her undivided attention and to make sure she hears me loud and clear. \"Just because you\u0027ve got a bad home life doesn\u0027t give you the right to sit there and be rude.\" \"Sure it does,\" she fires back. \"I bet you\u0027ve got parents with money-\" \"My mom works as a waitress in a diner.\" \"Well I bet your dad ain\u0027t a drunk-\" \"I wouldn\u0027t know,\" I tell her. \"My dad walked out on my mom. I haven\u0027t seen him in years. Oh, and I forgot to mention that I fell for the guy who went to jail for hitting me with his car. I wasn\u0027t supposed to be talking to him in the first place. Then he came on this trip, but now he\u0027s not talking to me again, and I\u0027m supposed to pretend like we\u0027re just friends and I\u0027m afraid of losing him although I know that\u0027s stupid because I feel like I\u0027ve already lost him ... and none of it would have happened if it weren\u0027t for a reckless driving incident. So when you get out of this place, please don\u0027t drive recklessly or you might end up with a permanent disability, boyfriendless, and an outcast at school.\" Instead of the girl falling asleep or giving me attitude, she\u0027s now staring at me wide-eyed. \"All right. You made your point. I get it.\" \"Thanks,\" I tell her, and mean it. \"Does it suck when people stare at you when you walk?\" she asks. At first when I got out of the hospital I didn\u0027t even want to get out of my wheelchair and walk, because I knew I drew more stares from my ridiculously pronounced limp than being confined to a wheelchair. I hated the stares. \"I hate being stared at, but I try and block it out,\" I tell her. \"I admit it makes me feel like I\u0027m the main event at a freak show.\" I look down and say what I don\u0027t like to put into words but it\u0027s the honest truth. \"There\u0027s not a day goes by that I wish the accident hadn\u0027t happened and that I could be normal. It\u0027s on my mind every day.\" \"Not a day goes by where I don\u0027t regret doin\u0027 what I done to get myself locked up in here,\" she says. \"I don\u0027t know if I can ask you questions about why you\u0027re here.\" \"Let\u0027s just say I hurt someone real bad,\" she tells me, then focuses at a spot on the wall. Maybe she doesn\u0027t want to see my reaction. I look at the female guard blocking the door and Ms. Bushnell on the opposite end of the room. They\u0027re eye ing the inmates. I wonder if there\u0027s ever a time they\u0027re not being watched or evaluated. I think of Caleb, who told me he hated being watched by guards every second of the day. I wonder how he\u0027s holding up now, being here again. \"It must be horrible being in here,\" I mumble. The girl shrugs. \"Actually it ain\u0027t that bad. Beats bein\u0027 home. I guess I hate bein\u0027 here \u0027cause it reminds me of what I done. I hurt this girl. The memories of that night give me nightmares most nights. I was thinkin\u0027 about wri- tin\u0027 her a letter, but she\u0027d prob\u0027ly throw it out and never read it.\" \"You could try. If anything it\u0027ll probably make you feel better to write it down.\" \"I don\u0027t think so.\" \"Just think about it.\" \"You have one more minute, ladies!\" Ms. Bushnell announces loudly. \"Say your good-byes and line up at the door.\" \"Yeah, well, I guess it was cool meeting you,\" the girl says. \"The girls who don\u0027t got no visitors got to come to talk to you guys. It sucks when it\u0027s visiting day and nobody calls out your name that you got a visitor, so, uh, thanks for bein\u0027 here.\" She clears her throat. \"I\u0027m Vanessa. My friends back home called me V, but to be honest I don\u0027t got no friends anymore. I raise my hand. Ms. Bushnell walks over to our table. \"Is there a problem?\" she asks. \"No,\" I\u0027m quick to tell her. \"I just wanted to know if I could have Vanessa\u0027s address ... so we can be pen pals.\" Ms. Bushnell\u0027s stern face softens. \"That would be fine. I\u0027ll give you the information before you leave the building.\" \"You didn\u0027t have to go an\u0027 do that,\" Vanessa says when Ms. Bushnell walks away. \"I know.\" Vanessa smiles, the first smile I\u0027ve seen from her since she walked in the room. \"You\u0027re okay, Maggie. And if you do ever write me, I promise to write back. Just don\u0027t expect no fancy writin\u0027.\" \"It\u0027s a deal.\" \"And just so you know, I don\u0027t think you\u0027re a freak at all. In fact, I think you\u0027re one of the coolest girls I\u0027ve ever met.\" I smile. \"I\u0027m a geek,\" I tell her. \"No you\u0027re not.\" She points her finger at me. \"You, Maggie, are one cool chick. Don\u0027t forget it.\" A cool chick? \"Nobody has ever called me cool before.\" \"That\u0027s \u0027cause you don\u0027t act it. If you think you\u0027re cool and act like you\u0027re the shit, everyone\u0027ll start treating you like you\u0027ve got it goin\u0027 on. You get what I\u0027m sayin\u0027?\" \"I think so.\" \"Don\u0027t waste a single day thinkin\u0027 you\u0027re a Beek, or you might as well be locked in here like me.\" Vanessa and the other girls get in a single file line by the locked metal door with their hands held behind their backs. Some of the girls look really young ... like they\u0027re barely in high school or even younger than that. The guard leads them out. Before Vanessa leaves, she looks back and gives me a small good-bye nod. According to Vanessa, my limp and scars don\u0027t matter. I\u0027m a cool chick. I just have to start believing it. Our whole Re-START group is quiet as we leave the DOC. I head for the back of the van where Caleb usually sits, but when he sees me, he slides into the front row next to Trish. I\u0027m stuck in the back with Lenny. When we get back to Dixon Hall, Damon tells us we have two days off to rest and have fun. Matt suggests we go to Independence Grove tomorrow to rent canoes and fish in the lake. Caleb seems really distant since we left the detention center. I wonder what happened with him on the guys\u0027 side of the jail. I don\u0027t find out, though, because Caleb spends the rest of the evening alone in his room. Damon calls him to the lounge area for dinner. \"I\u0027ll just grab something from the fridge later,\" he says. When we\u0027re about to watch a movie in the lounge, I peek in and see him lying on his bed, staring at the ceiling. \"Caleb, we\u0027re watching a movie.\" \"Watch without me.\" \"Are you okay?\" I ask tentatively. \"Want to talk?\" He gives a short laugh and shakes his head. \"Are you going to be mad at me forever?\" He doesn\u0027t answer. The next morning, as we\u0027re all rubbing on sunscreen, Caleb is the last to get ready. He slaps on a baseball cap, long shorts, and a tank top. Caleb\u0027s tattoo reminds me of black flames licking his skin. It makes him look tough and untouchable, which I\u0027m sure was the look he was going for when he got it. At the park, Damon buys us worms. He rents fishing gear and three boats, and tells us we\u0027re on our own and he\u0027ll be back before noon with lunch. \"Hey Trish,\" Lenny says as he watches her lay out a towel on the sandy beachfront. \"Do you know you can see your nipple outline through your bikini top?\" \"You\u0027re a pig,\" Trish says, then pushes Lenny away. Lenny holds his hands up. \"What? I was gonna say you have nice nips. Geez, Trish. Get a grip and learn how to take a compliment.\" We\u0027re all looking at Lenny as if he\u0027s out of his mind. Trish crosses her arms over her chest and makes a big deal of checking out Lenny\u0027s lower regions. \"Do you know you can\u0027t see your dick outline through your bathing suit?\" She tosses her hair and says, \"Just so you know, Lenny, that wasn\u0027t a compliment.\" Without warning, Lenny picks up Trish and carries her into the lake, kicking and screaming. \"You better not throw me in!\" she screams, still kicking, as she grabs onto Lenny\u0027s neck for dear life. \"Oh, yeah, baby, you\u0027re bein\u0027 tossed.\" Lenny says, seemingly oblivious to the kicks and pleas of the girl he\u0027s been at odds with since this trip started. I look over at Caleb, who\u0027s watching Lenny and Trish. He turns to me and an evil look crosses his face. He nods, as if Lenny is carrying out the most brilliant punishment to a girl who pissed him off. \"You\u0027re not thinking of tossing me in the lake,\" I tell him. \"Yeah,\" he says. \"I am.\" TWENTY-ONE Caleb his is the first time since I met Lenny that I get a glimpse his brain is capable of making a smart decision. My mind does the mental gymnastics to justify what I\u0027m thinking: Maggie\u0027s leg hinders her on land, but in the water she\u0027s just like the rest of us. She really screwed everything up for me by calling Damon. I need to take control of the situation and have no regrets. Which means ... Maggie needs to get wet. And, to use a Damonism: right now. \"Come here,\" I tell her. I strip off my tank in one swift movement. She steps back, her bare feet sinking into the sand. \"Promise me you won\u0027t toss me in the lake.\" She glances quickly at the water, then looks back at me. \"There\u0027s fish swimming around in there.\" \"They won\u0027t hurt you.\" \"I can\u0027t swim,\" she says quickly as she takes another step away from me. \"Caleb, not a good idea,\" Matt chimes in from beside her. I give Matt a you\u0027re an idiot look. \"I\u0027ve known Maggie all my life. Don\u0027t let her fool you-she\u0027s an excellent swimmer.\" So much for her being honest with me. A big splash brings our attention back to Lenny and a now very wet Trish. I take this break in Maggie\u0027s concentration to catch her. I lift her and carry her to the water\u0027s edge. \"I\u0027m wearing pants!\" she screams, wiggling violently. \"Let me down! Seriously, Caleb. I\u0027m the shit, so back offl\" I suppress a laugh, \u0027cause I never expected those words to come out of Maggie. \"You\u0027re the shit, huh? And all along I thought I was the shit.\" I walk further into the water. Her hands are wrapped tight around my neck, locking behind me like a vice. \"Okay, joke\u0027s over Caleb. Let me down.\" Her head nestles into the crook of my neck, and her wild hair is flying in my face. If I wasn\u0027t so angry with her I might be tempted to like the way she\u0027s clinging to me. \"Don\u0027t throw me in. Promise me.\" I go deeper. The sand on the bottom of the lake is soft, making my feet sink in. The water is up to my knees now. I pass Lenny and Trish, who are splashing each other. They\u0027re both soaked. Maggie and I are about to get soaked too. \"I\u0027m not gonna toss you in,\" I tell Maggie as I turn into a little bend in the lake for some privacy. Nobody on shore can see us now. \"I promise.\" She loosens her hold on my neck and leans her head back to look into my eyes. \"You\u0027re not?\" she asks, letting out a sigh of relief.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/return-to-paradise-leaving-paradise-2/page-17.html","bookId":2772,"book":{"id":2772,"title":"Return to Paradise (Leaving Paradise #2)","description":"Storyline: Return to Paradise (Leaving Paradise #2) Caleb Becker left Paradise eight months ago, taking with him the secret he promised to take to his grave.
