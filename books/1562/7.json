{"id":109446,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"Chapter 7 MORNING IS BROKEN It was Wednesday morning, three days before Christmas, when Lena Marquez awoke to find a strange man in her bed. The phone was ringing and the guy next to her made a moaning sound. He was partially covered by the sheets, but Lena was pretty sure that he was naked. \"Hello,\" she said into the phone. She lifted the sheet to look. Yep, he was naked. \"Lena, there\u0027s supposed to be a storm on Christmas Eve and we were going to have Mavis barbecue for Lonesome Christmas but she can\u0027t if it\u0027s raining and I yelled at Theo last night and went out and walked around in the dark for two hours and I think he thinks I\u0027m crazy and you should probably know that Dale didn\u0027t come home last night and his new - uh, the other, uh - the woman he lives with called Theo in a panic and he - \u0026raquo; \"Molly?\" \"Yeah, hi, how you doing?\" Lena looked at the clock on the nightstand, then back at the naked man. \"Molly, it\u0027s six-thirty.\" \"Thanks. It\u0027s sixty-seven degrees here. I can see the thermometer outside.\" \"What\u0027s wrong?\" \"I just told you: storm coming. Theo doubts sanity. Dale missing.\" Tucker Case rolled over, and despite being half asleep, he appeared to be ready for action. \"Well would you look at that,\" Lena thought to herself, then she realized she\u0027d said it into the phone. \"What?\" said Molly. Tuck opened his eyes and smiled at her, then followed her gaze south. He pulled the sheet out of her hand and covered himself. \"That\u0027s not for you. I just have to pee.\" \"Sorry,\" Lena said, pulling the sheet quickly over her head. It had been a long time since she\u0027d had to worry about it, but she suddenly remembered a magazine article about not letting a man see you first thing in the morning unless he\u0027d known you for at least three weeks. \"Who was that?\" Molly said. Lena made an eye tunnel in the sheet and looked out at Tucker Case, who was getting out of bed, totally unself-conscious, totally naked, his unit leading him into the bathroom, waving before him like a divining rod. She realized right then that she could always find new reasons to resent the male of the species - unself-consciousness was going on the list. \"No one,\" Lena said into the phone. \"Lena, you did not sleep with your ex again? Tell me you are not in bed with Dale.\" \"I\u0027m not in bed with Dale.\" Then the whole night came rolling back on her and she thought she might throw up. Tucker Case had made her forget for a while. Okay, maybe she could count that as a positive toward men, but the anxiety was back. She\u0027d killed Dale. She was going to jail. But she needed to pretend she didn\u0027t know anything. \"What did you say about Dale, Molly?\" \"So who are you in bed with?\" \"Dammit, Molly, what happened to Dale?\" She hoped she sounded convincing. \"I don\u0027t know. His new girlfriend called and said he didn\u0027t come home after the Caribou Christmas party. I just thought you should know, you know, in case it turns out that something bad happened.\" \"I\u0027m sure he\u0027s okay. He probably just met some tramp at the Head of the Slug and sold her on his workingman charm.\" \"Yuck,\" Molly said. \"Oh, sorry. Look, Lena, they said on the news this morning that a big storm is coming in off the Pacific. We\u0027re going to have El Ni\u0026ntilde;o this year. We have to figure out something for the food for Lonesome Christmas - not to mention what to do if a lot of people show up. The chapel is awfully small.\" Lena was still trying to figure out what to do about Dale. She wanted to tell Molly. If anybody would understand, it would be Molly. Lena had been around a couple of times when Molly had gone through her \"breaks.\" She understood things getting out of control. \"Look, Molly, I need - \u0026raquo; \"And I yelled at Theo last night, Lena. Really bad. He hasn\u0027t taken off like that in a long time. I may have fucked Christmas up.\" \"Don\u0027t be silly, Mol, you couldn\u0027t do that. Theo understands.\" Meaning, He knows you\u0027re crazy and loves you anyway. Just then, Tucker Case came back into the room, retrieved his pants from the floor, and started pulling them on. \"I\u0027ve got to go feed the bat,\" Tuck said. He pulled a banana partially out of his front pocket. Lena threw the sheets off her head and tried to think of something to say. Tuck grinned, pulling the banana all the way out. \"Oh, you thought I was just glad to see you?\" \"Uh - I - shit.\" Tuck stepped over and kissed her eyebrow. \"I am glad to see you,\" he said. \"But I have to feed the bat, too. I\u0027ll be right back.\" He walked out of the room, barefoot and shirtless. Okay, he probably would be back. \"Lena, who was that? Tell me?\" Lena realized that she was still holding the phone. \"Look, Molly, I\u0027ll have to call you back, okay? We\u0027ll figure something out for Friday night.\" \"But, I have to make amends - \u0026raquo; \"I\u0027ll call you.\" Lena hung up and crawled out of bed. If she was quick she could wash her face and get some mascara on before Tucker got back. She started zooming around the room, naked, until she felt someone watching her. There was a big bay window that looked out on a forest, and since her bedroom was on the second floor, it was like waking up in a tree house, but no one could possibly look in. She spun around and there, hanging from the gutter, was a giant fruit bat. And he was looking at her - no, not just looking at her, he was checking her out. She pulled the sheet off the bed and covered herself. \"Go eat your banana,\" she shouted at the bat. Roberto licked his chops. There had been a time, during his bong-rat years, when Theophilus Crowe would have stated, with little reservation, that he did not like surprises, that he preferred routine over variety, predictability over uncertainty, the known over the unknown. Then, a few years ago, while working on Pine Cove\u0027s last murder case, Theo had gotten to know and fallen in love with Molly Michon, the ex-scream queen of the B-movie silver screen, and everything changed. He had broken one of the cardinal rules - Never go to bed with anyone crazier than yourself - and he\u0027d been loving life ever since. They had their little agreement, if he stayed off his drug (pot) she\u0027d stay on hers (antipsychotics), and consequently she\u0027d have his unmuddled attention and he\u0027d only get the most pleasant aspects of the Warrior Babe persona that Molly sometimes slipped into. He\u0027d learned to delight in her company and the occasional weirdness that she brought into his life. But last night had been too much for him. He\u0027d come through the door wanting, nay, needing to share his bizarre story about the blond man, with the only person who actually might believe him and not berate him for being a stoner, and she had chosen that precise moment to lapse into hostile batshit mode. So, he\u0027d fallen off the wagon, and by the time he returned to their cabin that night, he had smoked enough pot to put a Rastafarian choir in a coma. That\u0027s not what the pot patch he\u0027d been growing had been for. Not at all. Not like the old days, when he maintained a small victory garden for personal use. No, the little forest of seven-foot sticky bud platforms that graced the edge of their lot on the ranch was purely a commercial endeavor, albeit for the right reason. For love. Over the years, even as the prospect of ever returning to the movies became more remote, Molly had continued to work out with her giant broadsword. Stripped to her underwear, or dressed in a sports bra and sweatpants, every day in the clearing in front of the cabin she\u0027d declare \"en garde\" to an imaginary partner and proceed to spin, leap, thrust, parry, hack, and slash herself breathless. Beyond the fact that the ritual kept her incredibly fit, it made her happy, which, in turn, pleased Theo to no end. He\u0027d even encouraged her to get involved in Japanese kendo, and to little surprise, she was excellent at it, consistently winning matches against opponents nearly twice her size. And indirectly, all this had led to Theo\u0027s growing pot commercially for the first time in his life. He\u0027d tried other means, but banks seemed more than a little reluctant to lend him nearly a half year\u0027s salary in order to purchase a samurai sword. Well, not samurai precisely, but a Japanese sword - an ancient Japanese sword, made by the master swordmaker Hisakuni of Yamashiro in the late thirteenth century. Sixty thousand folded layers of high carbon steel, perfectly balanced, and razor sharp even eight hundred years later. It was a tashi, a curved cavalry sword, longer and heavier than the traditional katanas used later by samurais in ground combat. Molly would appreciate the weight during her workouts, as its heft was closer to that of the theatrical broadsword she\u0027d brought with her as a legacy of her failed movie career. She would also appreciate that it was real, and Theo hoped that she\u0027d see that it was his way of saying that he loved all the parts of her, even the Warrior Babe (he just liked rubbing up against some parts more than others). The tashi was now wrapped in velvet and hiding at the back of the top shelf of Theo\u0027s closet, where he used to keep his bong collection. The money? Well, an old friend of Theo\u0027s from the stoner days, a Big Sur grower now turned wholesaler, had been happy to advance Theo the money against his crop. It was supposed to have been a purely commercial venture: get in, get out, and nobody gets hurt. But now Theo was showing up stoned for work for the first time in years, and following a bad night, he could just sense that this wasn\u0027t going to be a good day. Then the call came in from Dale Pearson\u0027s girlfriend/wife/whatever, and the descent into hell day started. Theo drowned his eyes in Visine and stopped at Brine\u0027s Bait, Tackle, and Fine Wines for a large coffee before he headed over to Lena Marquez\u0027s house in search of her ex-husband. While it was clear from the incident at the Thrifty-Mart on Monday, and a dozen earlier incidents, that their dislike for each other bordered on hatred, it hadn\u0027t stopped them from hooking up from time to time for some familiar post-divorce sex. Theo wouldn\u0027t have even known about it, except Molly was good friends with Lena and women talked about that sort of thing. Lena lived in a nice two-story Craftsman-style house on a half acre of pine forest that butted up to one of Pine Cove\u0027s many ranches. It was more house than she would have been able to afford working as a property manager, but then, she had put up with Dale Pearson for five years of marriage, and for five years since, so it was the least she deserved, Theo thought. He liked the sound of his hiking boots on the porch as he walked to the front door, and he thought that he and Molly should build a porch on their little cabin. He thought they could maybe get a wind chime, and a swing, have a little heater so they could sit outside on cold evenings. Then he realized, as he felt that vibration of footsteps coming to the door, that he was totally and completely baked. That they would know he was baked. That no amount of Visine or coffee was going to cover the fact that he was baked. Twenty years of functioning stoned was not going to serve him now - he\u0027d lost his edge, he was no longer in the game, the eye of the tiger was bloodshot. \"Hi, Theo,\" Lena said, opening the door. She wore a man\u0027s oversize sweatshirt and red socks. Her long black hair, which normally flowed down her back like liquid satin, was all knotted up at the back of her head, and there was a big tangle sticking out by one ear. Sex hair. Theo shuffled on the porch like a kid getting ready to ask the girl next door for a first date. \"I\u0027m sorry to bother you so early, but I wondered if you\u0027ve seen Dale. Since Monday, I mean.\" She seemed to fade away from the door, like she was ready to faint. Theo was sure it was because she knew he was high. \"No, Theo. Why?\" \"Well, uh, Betsy called, and said that Dale didn\u0027t come home last night.\" Betsy was Dale\u0027s new wife/girlfriend/whatever. She was a waitress down at H.P.\u0027s Cafe and over the years had become notorious for having affairs with a lot of married guys. \"I was just, uh...\" Why wouldn\u0027t she interrupt him? He didn\u0027t want to say that he knew that she and Dale got together for spite sex occasionally. He wasn\u0027t supposed to know.\"... so, uh, I was just wondering.\" \"Hi, who\u0027s this?\" said a blond guy who had appeared shirtless behind Lena in the doorway. \"Oh, thank God,\" Theo said, taking a deep breath. \"I\u0027m Theo Crowe, I\u0027m the town constable.\" He looked at Lena for an introduction. \"This is Tucker - uh, Tuck.\" She had no idea what this guy\u0027s last name was. \"Tucker Case,\" said Tucker Case, stepping around Lena and offering his hand to shake. \"I should have introduced myself to you sooner, I guess, since we\u0027re in the same business.\" \"What business is that?\" Theo never thought of himself as being a businessman, but he guessed that he was now. \"I\u0027m flying helicopter for the DEA,\" said Tucker Case. \"You know, infrared, finding growers and stuff.\" Clear! His heart has stopped! Code blue! Five hundred milligrams of epinephrine, direct shot to the pericardium, stat! He\u0027s flatlining, people. Clear! \"Nice to meet you,\" Theo said, hoping his heart failure wasn\u0027t showing. \"Well, sorry to bother you. I\u0027ll just be on my way.\" He let go of Tuck\u0027s hand and started walking away, thinking: Don\u0027t walk stoned, don\u0027t walk stoned - for the love of God, how did I do this all of those years? \"Uh, Constable,\" Tuck said. \"Why was it that you stopped by? Ouch!\" Theo turned. Lena had just punched the pilot in the arm, evidently pretty hard - he was massaging it. \"Uh, nothing. Just a fellow didn\u0027t go home last night, and I thought Lena might have an idea where he went.\" Theo was trying to back away from the house, but then stopped, remembering that he might trip on the porch steps. How would he explain that to the DEA? \"Last night? That\u0027s not even a missing person for, what, twenty-four, forty-eight hours? Ouch! Dammit, that\u0027s not necessary.\" Tucker Case rubbed his shoulder where Lena had punched him again. Theo thought that she might have violence issues with men. Lena looked at Theo and grinned, as if she was embarrassed about the punch. \"Theo, Molly called me this morning and told me about Dale. I told her I hadn\u0027t seen him. Didn\u0027t she tell you?\" \"Sure. Sure, she told me. I just, you know, I thought you might have some ideas. I mean, your friend is right, Dale\u0027s not really missing, officially, for another twelve hours or so, but, you know, it\u0027s a small town, and I, you know, have a job and stuff.\" \"Thanks, Theo,\" Lena said, waving to him even though he was only a few feet away and wasn\u0027t moving away from the house. The pilot was waving, too, smiling. Theo didn\u0027t like being around new lovers who had just gotten laid, especially when things weren\u0027t going that well in his own love life. They seemed smug, even if they weren\u0027t trying to be. He spotted something dark swinging from the ceiling of the porch, right where the wind chime would have been on his and Molly\u0027s porch, if he hadn\u0027t just sacrificed their security by relapsing into dope-fiendism. It couldn\u0027t be what it looked like. \"So, that\u0027s a, uh, that looks like - \u0026raquo; \"A bat,\" said Lena. Holy fuck, Theo thought, that thing is huge. \"A bat,\" he said. \"Sure. Of course.\" \"Fruit bat,\" Tucker Case clarified. \"From Micronesia.\" \"Oh, right,\" Theo said. Micronesia was not a real place. The blond guy was fucking with him. \"Well, I\u0027ll see you guys.\" \"See you at Lonesome Christmas on Friday,\" Lena said. \"Say hi to Molly.\" \" \u0027Kay,\" Theo said, climbing into the Volvo. He closed the car door. They went inside. He let his head hit the steering wheel. They know, he thought. \"He knows,\" Lena said, her back against the front door. \"He doesn\u0027t know.\" \"He\u0027s smarter than he looks. He knows.\" \"He doesn\u0027t know. And he didn\u0027t look dumb, he looked kind of stoned.\" \"No, he wasn\u0027t stoned, that was suspicion.\" \"Don\u0027t you think if he was suspicious he might have asked where you were last night?\" \"Well, he could see that, with you walking out there with your shirt off, and me looking so, you know - so - \u0026raquo; \"Satisfied?\" \"No, I was going to say \u0027disheveled. \" She punched his arm. \"Jeez, get over yourself.\" \"Ouch. That is completely out of line.\" \"I\u0027m in trouble here,\" Lena said. \"You can at least be supportive.\" \"Supportive? I helped you hide the body. In some countries that implies commitment.\" She wound up to punch him, then caught herself, but left her fist there in the air, just in case. \"You really don\u0027t think he was suspicious?\" \"He didn\u0027t even ask why you have a giant fruit bat hanging out on your porch. He\u0027s oblivious. Just going through the motions.\" \"Why do I have a giant fruit bat hanging from the porch?\" \"Comes with the package.\" He grinned and walked away. Now she felt stupid, standing there, her fist in the air. She felt unenlightened, dense, silly, unevolved, all the things she thought only other people were. She followed him into the bedroom, where he was putting on his shirt. \"I\u0027m sorry I hit you.\" He rubbed his bruised shoulder. \"You have tendencies. Should I hide your shovel?\" \"That\u0027s a horrible thing to say.\" She almost punched him, but instead, trying to be more evolved, and less threatening, she put her arms around him. \"It was an accident.\" \"Release me. I have to go spot bad guys with my helicopter,\" he said, patting her on the bottom. \"You\u0027re taking the bat with you, right?\" \"You don\u0027t want to hang out with him?\" \"No offense, but he\u0027s a little creepy.\" \"You have no idea,\" said Tuck.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-stupidest-angel-pine-cove-3/page-7.html","bookId":1562,"book":{"id":1562,"title":"The Stupidest Angel (Pine Cove #3)","description":"Storyline: The Stupidest Angel: A Heartwarming Tale of Christmas Terror Sleepy Pine Cove, Calif., is abuzz with Christmas spirit, but Lena Marquez is fed up with her despicable ex-husband, Dale Pearson.
