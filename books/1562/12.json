{"id":109451,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"Chapter 12\\n\\n THE STUPIDEST ANGEL\u0027S CHRISTMAS MIRACLE\\n\\n Sundown, Christmas Eve. The rain was coming down so hard that there didn\u0027t appear to be any space between the drops - just a wall of water, moving almost horizontally on wind that was gusting to seventy miles per hour. In the forest behind the Santa Rosa Chapel, the angel chewed his Snickers and ran a wet hand over the tire tracks at the back of his neck, thinking, I really should have gotten more specific directions.\\n\\n He was tempted to go find the child again and ask him exactly where Santa Claus was buried. He realized now that \"somewhere in the woods behind the church\" wasn\u0027t telling him much. To go back to get directions, however, would dilute somewhat the whole miraculousness of the miracle.\\n\\n This was Raziel\u0027s first Christmas miracle. He\u0027d been passed over for the task for two thousand years, but finally his turn had come up. Well, actually, the Archangel Michael\u0027s turn had come up, and Raziel ended up getting the job by losing in a card game. Michael had bet the planet Venus against his assigned task of performing the Christmas miracle this year. Venus! Although he wasn\u0027t really sure what he would have done with Venus had he won it, Raziel knew he needed the second planet, if for no other reason than that it was large and shiny.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t like the whole abstract quality of the Christmas miracle mission. \"Go to Earth, find a child who has made a Christmas wish that can only be granted by divine intervention, then you will be granted powers to grant that wish.\" There were three parts. Shouldn\u0027t the job be given to three angels? Shouldn\u0027t there be a supervisor? Raziel wished he could trade this in for the destruction of a city. That was so simple. You found the city, you killed all the people, you leveled all the buildings, even if you totally screwed it up you could track down the survivors in the hills and kill them with a sword, which, in truth, Raziel kind of enjoyed. Unless, of course, you destroyed the wrong city, and he\u0027d only done that what? Twice? Cities in those days weren\u0027t that big, anyway. Enough people to fill a couple of good-size Wal-Marts, tops. Now there\u0027s a mission, thought the angel: \"Raziel! Go forth into the land and lay waste unto two good-size Wal-Marts, slay until blood doth flow from all bargains and all the buildings are but rubble - and pick up a few Snickers bars for yourself.\"\\n\\n A tree waving in the wind nearby snapped with the report of a cannon, and the angel came out of his fantasy. He needed to get this miracle done and be gone. Through the rain he could see that people were starting to arrive at the little church, fighting their way through the wind and the rain, the lights in the windows flickering even as the party was starting. There was no going back, the angel thought. He would just have to wing it (which, considering he was an angel, he really should have been better at).\\n\\n He raised his arms to his sides and his black coat streamed out behind him on the wind, revealing the tips of his wings folded underneath. In his best pronouncement voice, he called out the spell.\\n\\n \"Let he who lies here dead arise!\" He sort of did a hand motion to cover pretty much the general area. \"Let he who does not live, live again. Arise from your grave this Christmas and live!\" Raziel looked at the half-eaten Snickers he was holding and realized that maybe he should be more specific about what was supposed to happen. \"Come forth from the grave! Celebrate! Feast!\"\\n\\n Nothing. Nothing whatsoever happened.\\n\\n There, said the angel to himself. He popped the last of the Snickers bar into his mouth and wiped his hands on his coat. The rain had subsided for a bit and he could see a ways into the woods. Nothing was happening.\\n\\n \"I mean it!\" he said in his big scary angel voice.\\n\\n Not a damn thing. Wet pine needles, some wind, trees whipping back and forth, rain. No miracle.\\n\\n \"Behold!\" said the angel. \"For I am really not kidding.\"\\n\\n A great gust of wind came up at that second and another nearby pine snapped and fell, missing the angel by only a few feet.\\n\\n \"There. It\u0027s just going to take a little time.\"\\n\\n He walked out of the woods and down Worchester Street into town.\\n\\n \"Wow, I\u0027m famished all of a sudden,\" said Marty in the Morning, all dead, all the time.\\n\\n \"I know,\" said Bess Leander, poisoned yet perky. \"I feel really strange. Hungry, and something else. I\u0027ve never felt this before.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, my dear,\" said Esther, the schoolteacher, \"I can suddenly think of nothing but brains.\"\\n\\n \"How \u0027bout you, kid?\" asked Marty in the Morning. \"You thinking about brains?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" said Jimmy Antalvo. \"I could eat.\"\\n\\n For Luck, There Is No Chapter 13.\\n\\n JUST THIS CHRISTMAS PHOTO ALBUM\\n\\n Sometimes, if you look closely at family snapshots, you can see in the faces of the children, portents of the adults they will become. In the adults, you can sometimes see the face behind the face. Not always, but sometimes...\\n\\n Tucker Case\\n\\n In this shot we see a well-to-do California family posed in front of their lakeshore estate in Elsinore, California. (It\u0027s an eight-by-ten color glossy, embossed with the trademark of a professional photographer\u0027s studio.)\\n\\n They are all tanned and healthy-looking. Tucker Case is perhaps ten years old, dressed in a little sport coat with a yachting ensign on the breast pocket and little tasseled loafers. He is standing in front of his mother, who has the same blond hair and bright blue eyes, the same smile that looks not as if she is presenting her dental work, but as if she is just seconds from bursting out laughing. Three generations of Cases - brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, and cousins - look perfectly coiffed, pressed, washed, and shined. All are smiling, except for one little girl down front, who has an expression of abject horror on her face.\\n\\n A closer look reveals the back of her red Christmas dress is tossed up to one side, and snaking in from the side, from under his little blue sport coat, is the hand of young Tuck, who has just stolen an incestuous squeeze of his cousin Janey\u0027s eleven-year-old bottom.\\n\\n What is telling about this picture is not the surreptitious booty grope, but the motive, because here Tucker Case is at an age where he is much more interested in blowing stuff up than he is in sex, yet he is precociously cognizant of just how much his advances will freak his cousin out. This is his raison d\u0027��tre. It should be noted that Janey Case-Robbins will go on to distinguish herself as a successful litigator and advocate for women\u0027s rights, while Tucker Case will go on to be a serially heartbroken horn dog with a fruit bat.\\n\\n Lena Marquez\\n\\n The shot is taken in someone\u0027s backyard on a sunny day. There are children all around and it\u0027s obvious that a big party is going on.\\n\\n She\u0027s six, wearing a fluffy pink dress and patent-leather shoes. She couldn\u0027t be any cuter, with her long black hair tied up into ponytails with red ribbons and flying out behind her like silk comet tails as she pursues the pi\u0026ntilde;ata. She\u0027s blindfolded, and her mouth is wide open, letting forth a burst of that high, little-girl laugh that sounds like joy itself, because she\u0027s just made solid contact with the stick and she\u0027s sure that she has released candy, and toys, and noisemakers for all the children. What she has, in fact, done, has solidly smacked her uncle Octavio in the cojones.\\n\\n Uncle Octavio is caught in a magic moment of transition, his face changing from joy to surprise to pain, all at once. Lena is still adorable and sweet and unsullied by the disaster she has wrought. Feliz Navidad!\\n\\n Molly Michon\\n\\n It\u0027s Christmas morning, post-present-opening storm. Tissue paper and ribbon are strewn around the floor, and off to one side you can see a coffee table, and on it an ashtray the size of a hubcap overflowing with butts, and an empty bottle of Jim Beam. Front and center is six-year-old Molly Achevski (she would change her last name to Michon at nineteen on the advice of an agent \"because it sounds fucking French, people love that\"). Molly is wearing a red sequined ballerina outfit, red galoshes that hit her bare legs about midcalf, and a giant, cheeky grin with a hole in the middle where her front teeth used to be. She has one foot propped up on a large Tonka dump truck as if she has just conquered it in a grudge match, and her younger brother Mike, four, is trying to pry the truck out from under her. Tears are streaming down his cheeks. Molly\u0027s other brother, Tony, five, is looking up to his sister like she is the princess of all things good. She has already poured him a bowl of Lucky Charms this morning, as she does for both her brothers every morning.\\n\\n In the background, we see a woman in a bathrobe lying on the couch, one hand hanging to the floor holding a cigarette that has burned itself out hours before. The silvery ash has left a streak on the carpet.\\n\\n No one has any idea who took this picture.\\n\\n Dale Pearson\\n\\n This one was taken only a few years ago, when Dale was still married to Lena. It\u0027s the Caribou Lodge Christmas party, and Dale is, once again, dressed as Santa, sitting on a makeshift throne. He is surrounded by drunken revelers, all laughing, all holding the various joke gifts that Dale has passed out to them earlier that night. Dale is brandishing his own present, a fourteen-inch-long rubber penis, as big around as a soup can. He\u0027s waving it at Lena with a leer, and she, dressed in a black cocktail dress and a single string of pearls, looks quite horrified at what he\u0027s saying, which is: \"We\u0027ll put this rascal to good use later tonight, huh, baby?\"\\n\\n The irony of it is that later that night, he will don one of his vintage German SS uniforms - everything but the jodhpurs, anyway - and what he asks Lena to do with his new present is exactly what she told him he could do with it at the party. She will never know if it was she who gave him the idea, but it will be a milestone in her move toward divorce proceedings.\\n\\n Theophilus Crowe\\n\\n At thirteen, Theo Crowe is already six feet four inches tall, and weighs a little over a hundred pounds. It is a classic scene of the three kings following the star. The seventh-grade music class is performing Amahl and the Night Visitors. Originally cast as one of the three kings, Theo is now dressed as a camel. His ears are the only parts of his body that are in proportion, and he looks very much like a camel fashioned out of wire by Salvador Dal��. His chance to play Balthazar, the Ethiopian king, was lost when he announced that the Magi had arrived bearing gold, Frankenstein, and myrrh. Later, he, the two other camels, and a sheep will be suspended for smoking the myrrh. (They would have never been caught had the sheep not suggested that they play a quick game of \"Kill the Man with the Baby Jesus\" out behind the theater. Evidently the myrrh was \"prime smokage.\")\\n\\n Gabe Fenton\\n\\n This one was taken just last year, at the lighthouse where Gabe has his cabin. You can see the lighthouse in the background, and windblown whitecaps out to sea. You can tell it\u0027s a windy day because the Santa hat that Gabe is wearing is streaming out to the side, and he\u0027s holding the reindeer antlers on Skinner\u0027s head. Crouched next to them, in a thousand-dollar St. John knit, red and cut in the style of a Napoleonic soldier, with brass buttons and gold braid on the shoulders, is Dr. Valerie Riordan. Her auburn hair is styled to curl behind her ears and accentuate her diamond hoop earrings. She\u0027s done up in Headline News Prompter Puppet makeup, as if her face has been completely sanded off, and then painted back on by a crack team of special-effects people - brighter, better, faster than a real human face. She\u0027s trying, really trying, to smile for the camera. She is holding her hair in one hand, and appears to be petting Skinner, but is, upon closer examination, holding him at bay. A racing stripe across the knee of her nylons betrays an earlier attempt by Skinner to share a holiday leg hump with the Food Guy\u0027s female.\\n\\n Gabe is scruffy in khakis and hiking boots. There\u0027s a fine coating of sand on his pants and boots from where he was sitting astride elephant seals that morning, gluing satellite-tracking devices on their backs. He has a great, hopeful smile, and not a clue that anything might be wrong with this picture.\\n\\n Roberto T. Fruitbat\\n\\n This picture was taken on the island of Guam, Roberto\u0027s birthplace. There are palm trees in the foreground. You can tell he\u0027s just a young fellow, because he has not yet acquired a pair of Ray-Bans, nor a master to bring him mangoes on demand. He\u0027s curled up in a Christmas wreath made from palm fronds and decorated with little papayas and red palm nuts. He is licking papaya pulp from his little doggy face. The children who found him in the wreath that Christmas morning are posed on either side of the door where the wreath hangs. They are both girls, and have the long curly brown hair of their Chamorro mother, the green eyes of their Irish-Catholic father, who is an American airman. Father is taking the picture. The girls are in bright, floral mission dresses with puffy sleeves.\\n\\n Later, after church, they will try to coax Roberto into a box so they can later cook him and serve him with saimen noodles. Although he escapes, the incident traumatizes the young bat and he does not speak for years.\\n\\n Chapter 14\\n\\n THE CAMARADERIE OF THE LONESOME CHRISTMAS\\n\\n Theo wore his cop shirt to the Lonesome Christmas party. Not because he didn\u0027t have anything else to wear, because there were still two clean flannels and a Phish sweatshirt in the Volvo that he\u0027d snagged from the cabin, but because with the storm pounding the stuffing out of Pine Cove, he felt as if he should be doing cop stuff. His cop shirt had epaulets on the shoulders (that are used for, uh, holding your paulets - no - for keeping your hat under - for your parrot to stand on - no) that looked cool and military, plus it had a little slot in the pocket where he could pin his badge and another one where he could stick a pen, which could be really handy in a storm in case you wanted to take notes or something, like: 7 p.m, Still Really Fucking Windy\\n\\n \"Wow, it\u0027s really fucking windy,\" Theo said. It was 7 p.m.\\n\\n Theo stood in the corner of the main room of the Santa Rosa Chapel next to Gabe Fenton, who was wearing one of his science shirts: a khaki canvas utility shirt with many pockets, slots, buttons, pouches, epaulets, zippers, Velcro loops, snaps, and vents, so you could hopelessly lose everything you owned in it and essentially sand your nipples off while patting the pockets and saying, \"I know I had it here somewhere.\"\\n\\n \"Yep,\" Gabe said. \"It was gusting to a hundred and twenty when I left the lighthouse\u0026raquo;\\n\\n \"You\u0027re kidding! A hundred and twenty miles per hour? We\u0027re all going to die,\" Theo said, feeling suddenly better.\\n\\n \"Kilometers per hour,\" Gabe said. \"Stand in front of me. She\u0027s looking.\" He snagged Theo by the epaulet (aha!) and pulled him around to block the view from the other side of the room. Across the open hardwood floor, Valerie Riordan, in charcoal Armani over red Ferragamos, was sipping a cranberry and soda from a plastic cup.\\n\\n \"Why\u0027s she here?\" Gabe whispered. \"Didn\u0027t she get a better offer from some country club or some business guy or something?\" Gabe said the word business like it was a putrid taste that he needed to spit out before it sickened him, which was exactly how he meant it. Although Gabe did not live in an ivory tower, he did live next to one, and it gave him a skewed perspective on commerce.\\n\\n \"Your eye is twitching really badly, Gabe Are you okay?\"\\n\\n \"I think it\u0027s conditioning from the electrodes. She looks so great, don\u0027t you think?\"\\n\\n Theo looked over at Gabe\u0027s ex-girlfriend, considered the heels, the stockings, the makeup, the hair, the lines of her suit, her nose, her hips, and felt like he was looking at a sports car that he could not afford, would not know how to drive, and he could only envision himself entangled in the wreckage of, wrapped around a telephone pole.\\n\\n \"Her lipstick matches her shoes,\" Theo said, by way of not really answering his friend. That sort of thing didn\u0027t happen in Pine Cove. Well, Molly did have some black lipstick that matched a pair of black boots she had, which she wore with nothing else, but he really didn\u0027t want to think about that. In fact, this moment would only have any meaning at all when he shared it with Molly, which he realized he wasn\u0027t going to be doing, which made him jealous of Gabe\u0027s twitch for a second.\\n\\n The double doors to the chapel opened, and wind whipped through the room, rattling the few strands of crepe paper that still clung to the wall to this point and knocking a couple of ornaments off the giant Christmas tree. Tucker Case came in, his bomber jacket dripping, a little furry face sticking out through the V in the zipper in the front.\\n\\n \"No dogs,\" said Mavis Sand, who was fighting to get the doors shut. \"We\u0027ve just let kids come the last couple of years, and I\u0027m not happy about it.\"\\n\\n Tuck grabbed the other door and pulled it shut, then reached over Mavis and caught the door she was battling. \"He\u0027s not a dog.\"\\n\\n Mavis turned around and looked right into the face of Roberto, who made a little barking sound. \"That\u0027s a dog. Not much of a goddamn dog, I\u0027ll give you that, but a dog. And he\u0027s wearing sunglasses.\"\\n\\n \"So?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s dark, moron. Get rid of the dog.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s not a dog,\" Tuck said, and to illustrate his point, he unzipped his jacket, took Roberto by the feet, and flung him at the ceiling. The bat yelped, opened his leathery wings, and flew to the top of the Christmas tree, where he caught the star, swung halfway around, and settled, upside down, hanging there above the room, looking, despite his cheery nature and hot pink sunglasses, a little creepy.\\n\\n Everyone in the place, thirty or so people, stopped whatever they were doing and looked. Lena Marquez, who had been cutting lasagna into squares over at the buffet table, looked up, made brief eye contact with Tuck, then looked away. Except for the boom box playing reggae Christmas carols and the wind and rain thrashing outside, there was not a sound.\\n\\n \"What?\" Tuck said to everyone and no one in particular. \"You people act like you\u0027ve never seen a bat before.\"\\n\\n \"Looked like a dog,\" Mavis said from behind him.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have a no-bat policy, then?\" Tuck said, not turning around.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t think so. You got a great ass, flyboy, you know that?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, it\u0027s a curse,\" Tuck said. He eyed the ceiling for any mistletoe he might get trapped under, spotted Theo and Gabe, then made a beeline for the corner where they were hiding.\\n\\n \"Oh my God,\" said Tuck as he was approaching. \"Did you guys see Lena? She\u0027s so hot. Don\u0027t you think she\u0027s hot? I miss her.\"\\n\\n \"Oh God, not you, too,\" Theo said.\\n\\n \"That Santa hat, it does something to me.\"\\n\\n \"That a Pteropus tokudae?\" asked Gabe, peeking out quickly from behind Theo and nodding toward the Christmas tree with the bat.\\n\\n \"No, that\u0027s Roberto. Why are you hiding behind the constable?\"\\n\\n \"My ex is here.\"\\n\\n Tuck looked over. \"The redhead in the suit?\"\\n\\n Gabe nodded.\\n\\n Tuck looked at him, back at Val Riordan, who was now chatting with Lena Marquez, then again at Gabe. \"Whoa, you were really crawling out of your gene pool, huh? Let me shake your hand.\" He reached around Theo, offering his hand to the biologist.\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t like you, you know?\" Theo said.\\n\\n \"Really?\" Tuck took his hand back. He looked around Theo at Gabe. \"Really?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re okay,\" said Gabe. \"He\u0027s just cranky.\"\\n\\n \"I am not cranky,\" Theo said, but, in fact, he was a little cranky. A little sad. A little stoned. A little out of sorts that this storm hadn\u0027t just blown over like he\u0027d hoped, and a little excited that it might actually turn into a disaster. Secretly, Theophilus Crowe loved a disaster.\\n\\n \"Understandable,\" Tuck said, squeezing Theo\u0027s shoulder. \"Your wife was a biscuit.\"\\n\\n \"Is a biscuit,\" corrected Theo, but then, \"Hey!\"\\n\\n \"No, it\u0027s okay,\" Tuck said. \"You were a lucky man.\"\\n\\n Gabe Fenton reached up and squeezed Theo\u0027s other shoulder. \"It\u0027s true,\" Gabe said. \"When Molly isn\u0027t completely off her rocker, she is a biscuit. Actually, even when she is - \u0026raquo;\\n\\n \"Would you guys quit calling my wife a biscuit! I don\u0027t even know what that means.\"\\n\\n \"Something we say in the islands,\" Tuck said. \"What I\u0027m saying is, you\u0027ve got nothing to be ashamed of. You guys had a good run. You can\u0027t expect her to lose her sense of judgment forever. You know, Theo, every now and then Eraserhead will hook up with Tinker Bell, or Sling Blade Carl will marry Lara Croft - that sort of thing gives us hope - but you can\u0027t count on it. You can\u0027t bet that way. Why, guys like us would always be alone if some women didn\u0027t have a deep-seated streak of self-destruction, isn\u0027t that right, Professor?\"\\n\\n \"Truth,\" said Gabe. He made a sort of swear-on-the-Bible gesture. Theo glared at him.\\n\\n \"Eventually a woman will wise up,\" Tuck continued.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s just gone off her meds.\"\\n\\n \"Whatever,\" Tuck said. \"I\u0027m just saying that it\u0027s Christmas and you should be grateful that you were ever able to fool someone into loving you in the first place.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m calling her,\" Theo said. He pulled his cell phone from the pocket of his cop shirt and keyed the button for his home number.\\n\\n \"Is Val wearing the pearl earrings?\" Gabe asked. \"I bought her those.\"\\n\\n \"Diamonds studs,\" said Tuck, checking over his shoulder.\\n\\n \"Dammit.\"\\n\\n \"Look at Lena in that Santa hat. That woman has a talent with tinsel, if you know what I mean?\"\\n\\n \"No idea,\" said Gabe.\\n\\n \"Me either. It just sounded kinky,\" said Tuck.\\n\\n Theo snapped the cell phone shut. \"I hate both you guys.\"\\n\\n \"Do not,\" said Tuck.\\n\\n \"No service?\" asked Gabe.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to see if the police radio in my car is working.\"\\n\\n Rain was pooling in the graveyard behind the chapel as the dead pulled one another from the muck.\\n\\n \"This looked easier in the movies,\" said Jimmy Antalvo, who was waist-deep in a puddle and being pulled out by Marty in the Morning and the new guy in the red suit. Jimmy\u0027s words were a little slurred and slurpy, between the mud and a facial structure that was mostly mortician\u0027s wax and wire. \"I thought I\u0027d never get out of that coffin.\"\\n\\n \"Kid, you\u0027re better off than a couple we\u0027ve pulled out,\" said Marty in the Morning. He nodded to a very feeble and mostly decomposed pile of animated meat that had at one time been an electrician. The mushy thing made a moaning sound.\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s that?\" asked Jimmy. The torrential rain had washed the mud out of his eyes.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s Alvin,\" said Marty. \"All we can understand from him.\"\\n\\n \"I used to talk to him all the time,\" said Jimmy.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s different now,\" said the guy in the red suit. \"Now you\u0027re really talking, not just thinking it. His talking equipment is past warranty.\"\\n\\n Marty, who had been portly in life but had slimmed down significantly since his death, bent down and got a good grip on Jimmy\u0027s arm, bending the elbow around his own, then made a great straining lift to pull the kid out. There was a loud pop and Marty went over backward into the mud. Jimmy Antalvo was waving around an empty leather jacket sleeve and yelling, \"My arm! My arm!\"\\n\\n \"Jeez, they should have sewn that on better,\" said Marty, holding the arm in the air, even as the hand appeared to be doing a very jerky version of a parade wave.\\n\\n \"This whole undead rigmarole is disgusting,\" said Esther, the schoolteacher, who was standing to the side with a few others who had already been dug up. Water was pouring off the shreds of her best church dress, which had been reduced by time to calico tatters. \"I\u0027ll not have anything to do with it.\"\\n\\n \"So you\u0027re not hungry?\" said the new guy, muddy rainwater streaming out of his Santa beard. He\u0027d been the first one out, since he hadn\u0027t had to escape a coffin.\\n\\n \"Fine, once we get the kid out we\u0027ll just push you back down your hole.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not saying that,\" said Esther. \"I would enjoy a snack. Something light. Mavis Sand, maybe. That woman can\u0027t have enough brains to spread on a cracker.\"\\n\\n \"Then shut up and help us get everyone out.\"\\n\\n Nearby, Malcolm Cowley was staring disapprovingly at one of the less articulate members of the undead who had been pulled from his grave and was showing lots of bare bone between the meat. The dead book dealer was wringing out his tweed jacket and shaking his head at every comment. \"Suddenly we are all gluttons, are we? Well, I have always enjoyed Danish Modern furniture for its functional yet elegant design, so once we have consumed the brains of these revelers, I feel compelled to seek out one of these furniture boutiques I have heard so much about from newlyweds in the chapel. First we feast, then IKEA.\"\\n\\n \"IKEA,\" chanted the dead. \"First we feast, then IKEA. First we feast, then IKEA.\"\\n\\n \"Can I eat the constable\u0027s wife\u0027s brain?\" asked Arthur Tannbeau. \"She sounds like she\u0027ll be spicy - \u0026raquo;\\n\\n \"Get everyone out of the ground, then we eat,\" said the new guy, who was used to telling people what to do.\\n\\n \"Who died and made you boss?\" asked Bess Leander.\\n\\n \"All of you,\" answered Dale Pearson.\\n\\n \"The man has a point,\" said Marty in the Morning.\\n\\n \"I think while you boys finish up here, I\u0027ll have a stroll around the parking lot. Oh my, I don\u0027t seem to be walking very well,\" said Esther, dragging one foot behind her and plowing a furrow in the mud as she moved. \"But IKEA does sound like a delightful after-supper adventure.\"\\n\\n No one knows why, but second only to eating the brains of the living, the dead love affordable prefab furniture.\\n\\n Across the parking lot, Theophilus Crowe was busy having the water in his ears replaced with dog spit.\\n\\n \"Get down, Skinner.\" Theo pushed the big dog away and keyed the mike on the police radio. He had been adjusting the squelch and the gain, and getting little more than distant disembodied voices, just a word here or there in the static. The rain on the car was so loud that Theo put his head down by the dash to better hear the little speaker, and Skinner, of course, took this as an invitation to lick more rain out of Theo\u0027s ears.\\n\\n \"Ack! Skinner.\" Theo grabbed the dog muzzle and steered it between the seats. It wasn\u0027t the dampness, or even the dog breath, which was considerable, it was the noise. It was just too loud. Theo dug into the console between the seats and found half a Slim Jim in a folded over wrapper. Skinner inhaled the tiny meat stick and savored the greasy goodness by smacking his chops right next to Theo\u0027s ear.\\n\\n Theo snapped the radio off. One of the problems with living in Pine Cove, with the ubiquitous Monterey pines, was that after a few years the Christmas trees stopped looking like Christmas trees and started looking like giant upturned dust mops, a great sail of needles and cones at the top of a long, slender trunk and a pancake root system - a tree especially adapted to fall over in high wind. So when El Ni\u0026ntilde;o cruised up the coast and storms like this came in, first cell and cable TV repeater stations lost power, soon the town lost its main power, and finally, phone lines would go down, effectively cutting all communications. Theo had seen it before, and he didn\u0027t like what it portended. Cypress Street would be underwater before dawn and people would be kayaking through the real-estate offices and art galleries by noon.\\n\\n Something hit the car. Theo turned on the headlights, but the rain was coming down so hard and the windows were so fogged with dog breath that he could see nothing. He assumed it was a small tree branch. Skinner barked, deafeningly loud in the enclosed space.\\n\\n He could go patrolling downtown, but with Mavis having closed the Slug for Christmas Eve, he couldn\u0027t imagine why anyone would be down there. Go home? Check on Molly? Actually, she was better equipped with her little four-wheel-drive Honda to drive in this mess, and she was smart enough to stay home in the first place. He was trying not to take it personally that she hadn\u0027t come to the party. Trying not to take to heart the pilot\u0027s words about not being worthy of a woman like her.\\n\\n He looked down, and there, cradled in bubble wrap in the console, was the art-glass bong. Theo picked it up, looked it over, then pulled a film can of sticky green buds from his cop-shirt pocket and began loading the pipe.\\n\\n Theo was briefly blinded by the spark of the disposable lighter, at the same time as something scraped against the car. Skinner jumped over into the front seat and barked at the window, his hefty tail beating against Theo\u0027s face.\\n\\n \"Down, boy. Down,\" Theo said, but the big dog was now digging at the vinyl panel on the door. Knowing that it meant that he\u0027d have to deal with a lot of wet dog later, but feeling that he really needed to get a buzz on in peace, Theo reached over and threw open the passenger door. Skinner bounded out the door. The wind slammed it behind him.\\n\\n There was a commotion outside, but Theo could see nothing, and he figured that Skinner was just frisking in the mud. The constable lit the bong and lost himself in the scuba bubbles of sweet comforting smoke.\\n\\n Outside the car, not ten feet away, Skinner was gleefully tearing the head off an undead schoolteacher. Her arms and legs were flailing and her mouth was moving, but the retriever had already bitten through the better part of her decayed throat and was shaking her head back and forth in his jaws. A skilled lip-reader would have been able to tell you that Esther was saying: \"I was only going to eat a little of his brain. This is entirely uncalled for, young man.\"\\n\\n I am so going to get bad-dogged for this, Skinner thought.\\n\\n Theo stepped out of the car into an ankle-deep puddle. Despite the cold, the wind, the rain, and the mud that had squished over the edge of his hiking boots, Theo sighed, for he was sorely, wistfully stoned, and slipping into that comfortable place where everything, including the rain, was his fault and he\u0027d just have to live with it. Not a maudlin self-pity that might have come from Irish whiskey, nor an angry tequila blame, nor a jittery speed paranoia, just a little melancholy self-loathing and the realization of what a total loser he was. \"Skinner. Get over here. Come on,boy, back in the car.\\n\\n Theo could barely see Skinner, but the big dog was on his back rolling in something that looked like a pile of wet, muddy laundry - sort of snaking back and forth with his mouth open and his pink tongue whipping around in ecstatic dogasm.\\n\\n Probably a dead raccoon, Theo thought, trying to blink some rain out of his eyes. I\u0027ve never been that happy. I will never be that happy.\\n\\n He left the dog to his joy and slogged back into the Lonesome Christmas. He thought he felt a hand across his neck as he wrestled his way through the double doors, then a loud moan when the doors slammed shut, but it was probably just the wind. It didn\u0027t feel like the wind. Had to be the wind. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-stupidest-angel-pine-cove-3/page-12.html","bookId":1562,"book":{"id":1562,"title":"The Stupidest Angel (Pine Cove #3)","description":"Storyline: The Stupidest Angel: A Heartwarming Tale of Christmas Terror \\n Sleepy Pine Cove, Calif., is abuzz with Christmas spirit, but Lena Marquez is fed up with her despicable ex-husband, Dale Pearson.
