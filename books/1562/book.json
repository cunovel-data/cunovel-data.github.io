Seven-year-old Josh Barker, thinking he\u0027s just seen the murder of Santa, prays for a miracle to save Christmas. To Lena\u0027s rescue comes Tucker Case, a slimy, reformed Casanova and DEA pilot, who gives her an alibi and sweeps her off her feet. The marijuana-cultivating town constable, Theo Crowe, suspects foul play, but Tucker intervenes with a blackmail scheme to keep the crime buried.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-stupidest-angel-pine-cove-3.jpg","author":"Christopher Moore","type":"Humorous","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":18,"category":{"id":13,"name":"Humorous","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
