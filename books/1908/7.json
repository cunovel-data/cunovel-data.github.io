{"id":87467,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"Before she could recover her wits and try to re-weld her considerable shields in place, he bent and lifted her up in his arms, guiding her arm so it was around his neck.\n Her other hand stayed curled in his shirt front as he lifted her, turned and moved out of the living area toward the wide staircase to the second landing.\n \"What are you doing? Why are you - \"\n \"Carrying you.\"\n \"Put me down.\" Her voice was weak, her body still moving with sexy convulsive shudders that made his cock even harder.\n \"That\u0027s \u0027Put me down, Master\u0027, and it should have a please at the front and a question mark at the end.\"\n Marguerite ground her teeth. \"Would you please put me down?\"\n \"No. Just hold on.\"\n She tightened her grip but realized immediately she was quite safe. She\u0027d never thought of herself as a woman who could be carried, because of her height and just...\n Well, because it had never occurred to her. Since he wouldn\u0027t release her she was forced to experience being held in a man\u0027s arms, a man apparently strong and balanced enough to carry her up the stairs two at a time with nary a break in pace. It put her body in close proximity to his, of course. Her arm around his neck, her side pressed against him and the cloth of her open shirt crumpled in between. Her breasts were still bare, such that he was indulging himself in a thorough study of their liberal movements caused by his strides.\n \"You should keep your eyes on the road,\" she said, noting how far up the stairs they were.\n \"Marguerite, in another minute, I\u0027m going to gag you.\"\n \"I thought we\u0027d already covered restraints.\"\n \"First off, there may be overlap in the requirements that will bring restraints into play again. Second, a gag is not a restraint. It\u0027s a life-saving device to keep me from strangling you. Hush now.\"\n \"My suitcase - \"\n \"Robert put it in our room.\"\n \"Our room. What - \" She closed her eyes at his look. Sucking in a deep breath, she made a concentrated effort to try and conform to the rules. \"May I ask a question?\"\n \"You may.\"\n \"Why would we be sharing a bedroom?\"\n \"You know the answer to that. Being a sub is about being available to your Master\u0027s desires at all times.\"\n She would be sharing the same room with him, possibly the same bed. And while she\u0027d laid down the rule of no sex, how could she have anticipated or even framed a rule of \"no intimacy\"? She would have been better off allowing sex and then perhaps he wouldn\u0027t have put so much effort into the other. Or perhaps the best way to have avoided the trap was not to have faced the hunter at all.\n He took her into a bathroom large enough to be a master bedroom. With its separate sauna and hot tub it reminded her of the kind of bathhouse the Romans might have favored. Towels stacked next to a tray covered by a hand towel drew her attention to a shallow square tub filled with steaming water about three feet deep. He lowered her to her feet as effortlessly as he had lifted her and she found she needed to hold on to him a moment to steady herself, the aftereffects of the orgasm still affecting her.\n \"I\u0027m going to undress you and lay you in that pool, massage your muscles with the jets.\" He drew her forward and uncovered the tray, revealing a gleaming line of shaving implements, lotions and creams. \"And when you\u0027re lying there relaxed, I\u0027ll spread your legs and shave your pussy. Make it smooth for my touch. Preparing and handling a sub\u0027s body intimately is a critical part of being a submissive and a pleasure to a Master.\"\n He was sure she had no idea she\u0027d gone as white as a sheet. Calling on the streak of ruthlessness that he\u0027d employed before in the face of a sub\u0027s fear, he used it now with calculated, benevolent intent. Knowing the woman in his bathroom was off balance because the world she\u0027d known was tilting on its axis, he was determined to have her tumble safely into his hands.\n \"Think about your subs. Those preparations you\u0027ve chosen to do yourself.\n Understanding what they were feeling as they submitted to your touch, knowing everything you did to them was your Will. Because it brought you pleasure and them pleasure as well. All right?\"\n She nodded, a bare movement, her gaze on something distant. Using a finger under her chin, he lifted her face. \"Unlike some Masters, Marguerite, remember, I want you to always look at me when I speak at you.\"\n When she raised her lashes, those clear pale eyes focused on his. His heart lurched at the visible attempt to keep panic under wraps. This was more than a Domme wary or even anxious about losing control. From her violent reaction at the table, he knew it sincerely frightened her.\n Taking both of her hands, he held them, encasing ice in warmth. Letting her feel the pressure of his fingers. \"I\u0027m going to undress you now. You\u0027ll stay still, only moving when I tell you that you have permission to move. Tell me you understand.\" She nodded again, a quick jerk.\n When he unbuttoned her cuffs and took the shirt off then the bra, Marguerite couldn\u0027t help but notice the gentle strength of his hands. She often shied away from being touched by adults, though she could manage the casual cordial touches that typified Southern relations in her tearoom with clients like Mrs. Allen. The few times a man had touched her she\u0027d been neutral about it, uncertain or decidedly uncomfortable.\n This felt different, this slow glide of skin over skin, again that heat sinking into her, the power that could take her over, force her physically to do what she didn\u0027t think she wanted to do.\n Her unfastened trousers were low on her hips and he slipped those down her legs, circling her hips with one arm to steady her, his palm comfortably braced on her buttock as he removed her shoes.\n While she did prepare her subs herself to a certain extent, she knew that he was aware she mainly focused on restraints. This intimacy she did not do. She usually had her subs undress themselves if they were not already restrained but oddly it did not seem servile for him to be attending to it. It felt like he\u0027d taken the reins from her and was handling everything. Keeping it personal.\n When he took her slacks over her feet she had nowhere but his shoulders to place her hands for balance, so she cupped one palm over the solid bone and muscle, feeling the fabric of his shirt, the shift of his body as he removed her panties. His thumbs slid intimately into the crease between thigh and pubis, making her feel the slick moisture there because of the startling climax he had pulled from her body. It wouldn\u0027t happen again. He\u0027d caught her off guard. Her experiencing sexual pleasure wasn\u0027t one of the requirements and she needed to exercise better control. He probably thought her a poor Mistress, so quickly gotten off.\n Why did she care what he thought? And why was she vacillating between professional pride and female vulnerability?\n \"You\u0027re thinking so hard there\u0027s smoke coming out of your ears.\" He rubbed his thumb over her clit, making her gasp. \"You\u0027re still swollen there. You\u0027ll arouse again in no time. You\u0027re so beautiful, angel.\"\n She blinked, surprised. She hadn\u0027t anticipated romance but it was in his face and voice as he looked at her. The sternness of a Master was in the set of his jaw and eyes, the resolution. That, along with the proprietary gaze he directed over her body created resentment but she knew that was knee-jerk and likely based on fear. Below that was something else, something that left her a little breathless and weak-kneed, an altogether perplexing reaction for her.\n His gaze descended, lingered on the ragged scar just below her knee, an oblong, rough-edged mark.\n \"Looks like a bone came through there.\" He went lower, to the second one at her shin. \"And there.\" His fingers touched it. \"Part your thighs for me.\" Determined not to hesitate, she took one step out, as rigid as a soldier. But it seemed her muscles could not help tensing as his touch followed the inside line of her thigh.\n She had to will herself not to clamp her thighs shut. \"Clasp your hands behind your back, Marguerite.\"\n The classic sub pose, allowing the Master unimpeded access to touch anything he wished. Legs spread, arms self-restrained and out of the way. His thumb and forefinger gently pinched her clit again, then he combed through the soft down of clipped hair over her pussy, his attention traveling up to her breasts, now tilted up from his ordered pose.\n \"You\u0027ll be lovely shaved.\"\n \"Why is it that men like a woman\u0027s pussy so bare?\"\n \"To see it better, of course. And because a woman reacts so much more intensely when the skin is exposed to the least amount of friction. You keep yours nicely trimmed, though. Why do you, since you rarely take your clothes off at The Zone?\"\n \"I...I like the way it feels. Shorter.\"\n \"Hmm. Well, it\u0027s about to be not only short but gone.\" When he pressed a control, she watched amazed as a stone square slab rose up in the center of the bathing pool until it was about six inches from the surface of the water. There were eye bolts embedded along the sides. Then he drew a full head mask from between two of the bathing towels. The mask only had one opening, for the mouth.\n \"When I lay you down on that tablet, I\u0027ll put this on you and bind your legs, arms and upper torso securely using those bolts.\" His voice was mild, inexorable, his eyes pinning her in place. \"Once I have you immobilized with the mask on, I\u0027ll tilt the stone tablet so your head and upper body just past the breasts will be below the surface of the water. Your hips, pussy and ass will be just above it, elevated so I can do a better job of removing the hair.\" He picked up a soft rubber tube and mouthpiece. \"This will allow you to breathe.\"\n She stared at him. \"Well, I guess when I said do it all at once...\" She broke off, took a step back. Then another. \"I... No. Please don\u0027t make me do this.\" Her fingers curled into fists, ready to fight, to claw, to do whatever needed to be done.\n He sat down, a hip on the edge of the bathing pool, studied her with an expression that was far too compassionate. \"You\u0027re not a prisoner here.\"\n \"Yes, I am. Because I know I have to do this as long as you\u0027re asking it. But if you don\u0027t ask, I don\u0027t have to.\" I won\u0027t have failed. I\u0027m not a coward.\n He nodded. \"I can see how you\u0027d see it that way. But Marguerite, listen to me. I know how hard this is for you. It seems daunting, terrible. But remember what we talked about earlier, what this whole weekend is about?\"\n \"Letting go of control.\"\n \"Yes. But more importantly it\u0027s about trust. I have to keep reminding you of that.\n Learning that you can trust your Master. Can you trust me?\" She opened her hands, drew in a breath. He waited on her. Gave her the time and space to pull it all back together, steady herself. At length, she lifted her gaze to his.\n \"I want to.\"\n \"All right, then.\" Tyler resisted the overwhelming urge to draw her into his arms, hold her close until she realized she didn\u0027t always have to manage her fear alone. \"I\u0027m going to do a little more explaining. I didn\u0027t choose this idly, or to make you panic. The whole process I described centers you on just one sensation. Physical touch. You\u0027re aware of your total helplessness. The only thing that tells you what\u0027s happening is my touch on your body. And gradually your thoughts will float away and there will only be sensation. When that happens, your fear will float away. You\u0027ll start to feel pleasure in that stillness. \u0027God is in the silence\u0027,\" he reminded her. \"It was your scroll that made me think of it.\"\n \"In the empty space,\" she murmured.\n \"You can do this, because you aren\u0027t doing it alone. I won\u0027t leave you for a second.\n You\u0027ll feel no pain. You\u0027ll sense nothing but my hands on you, your Master\u0027s hands your only focus.\"\n She closed her eyes so she could say it, a child\u0027s question. \"You won\u0027t leave me there?\"\n \"You have my word, angel.\" He touched her mouth with his fingers and she opened her eyes to find him in front of her. \"I won\u0027t be more than two feet from you at any time. I swear.\"\n \"You\u0027re not doing the things I expected. Making me call you Master, get on my knees and suck your cock.\"\n He winced. \"Is that how you do it with your subs? Just strip, let me tie you up and I\u0027ll torment you until I get you off?\"\n She looked startled, then inclined her head. \"Touche.\"\n \"That said, with male subs it is likely more physical,\" he acknowledged. \"What they want is simpler. They don\u0027t necessarily play a lot of games with themselves about sex. Women are more emotionally complex. Sometimes they don\u0027t know what it is they want until they feel it, and it can change from session to session.\" He smiled. \"It makes being a heterosexual Master very challenging.\n \"There\u0027s a time and a place for passion, the rise of possession in its rougher forms.\n But a submissive\u0027s surrender is a sweet, sweet gift. And perhaps a male sub comes to it in a more primal state. Most Masters enjoy the process of wooing, of winning that gift.\n And every woman is different.\"\n \"You must think I\u0027m incredibly foolish and weak.\"\n \"Anything but.\" And he said it with an instant fierceness that warmed the chill inside her. \"Marguerite, most Masters and Mistresses face this training with trepidation.\n They slog through, maybe enjoy some aspects of it, but they\u0027re always uncomfortable with giving up their control. You\u0027re obviously terrified at a bone-deep, phobic level.\n And yet here you are, doing it anyway. In my book, that\u0027s damn brave. And your opening up to me specifically means a great deal. Come on then.\" He took one of her cold hands in his. \"It will be all right.\"\n Such a simple reassurance but one she held to as he guided her to the side of the tub and picked up the head mask. \"Lift your arms and twist your hair up so it will be tucked in and won\u0027t get wet.\"\n He reached out as she complied, ran a hand down her side, over her hip. \"You\u0027re lovely, Marguerite. I\u0027m hard just looking at you, just breathing in your scent. Put your arms at your sides now.\"\n It was silly but the sensual compliment did reassure her, warm her. He eased the hood down over her head, laced it securely so she felt the restriction on her neck, the sides of her head, nose and ears. Darkness descended and noise became muffled but discernible, which she knew would end when he had her head under the water.\n \"Tyler?\"\n \"I\u0027m here. Stand where you are and don\u0027t move. I\u0027m sitting on the edge of the tub, just looking at you. Your breasts, the nipples drawn up hard and firm. Your soft cunt, long legs. Those pink lips of your mouth and your sex, making me thinking of stretching either or both with my cock. You are the most beautiful creature I\u0027ve ever seen.\"\n He caressed her pussy and she gasped at the surprise of not hearing or seeing him coming. And at the fact that his words had made her wet again, despite her trepidation.\n \"Tyler. I can\u0027t handle...hands in the dark.\"\n Taking both of her hands, Tyler let her feel his grip, warm and sure. \"They\u0027re my hands. Me. Only me. And it won\u0027t be dark for long, I promise. Trust me.\" Carefully, as he would guide a wild animal, he brought her to the side of the tub.\n The paleness of her skin, the long legs, the faint tremor through her breasts as she moved and an ass that he could pet and stroke forever until she was writhing with the stimulus. It all had him suppressing a groan. He wanted to bury himself in her wet heat, again and again. He\u0027d like to spend a week on each feature. He wanted to devour her whole, now.\n To rein in his passion, to serve her best, he turned her so her back was facing him.\n So he could see more clearly the marks she hadn\u0027t wanted him to see or ask about. The marks he\u0027d felt when he removed her shirt. Small circles, two lines of them going up either side of her spinal column. At her shoulder blades they arced out and curled over and under like a hideous Art Deco rendering of angel wings.\n Perhaps another person would have thought, based on her performance with Brendan, that she liked ritual scarification. So much that she would subject herself to well over sixty separate burns. But Tyler knew what he was looking at, understood it now because of her reluctant admission. I can\u0027t handle hands...in the dark. And because he knew what a cigarette burn looked like.\n Submissives often dealt with a lot of emotional baggage during the first rough steps of learning to relinquish control as they craved to do. At some point in her life, she\u0027d had control wrested from her, repeatedly.\n And she wondered if he thought her foolish and weak? Her courage humbled him beyond words, as did the faith she didn\u0027t even realize she\u0027d offered him by choosing him to fulfill this requirement.\n It looked like the pattern wasn\u0027t finished. While balanced, it was obvious the inflictor had spaced the burns so the design would fill in over time.\n \"You said you wouldn\u0027t ask.\" Her voice came into the pregnant silence.\n \"I haven\u0027t. Just tell me one thing. Is the son of a bitch dead?\" Her body tensed and he ran his hands up her arms, gentling her. \"Don\u0027t answer, sweetheart. I promised no questions. I withdraw it.\" But he\u0027d make it his business to find out, to make sure whoever had done this to her was no longer a threat. He would prove himself worthy of her faith.\n \"I could just be into burns.\"\n \"If that were true, you would shiver with pleasure when I touch you there. Instead you go cold and still, like a corpse.\"\n His arm went around her back and under her knees. He lifted her, setting her down on the marble surface of the square center of the pool. \"That stream you\u0027re feeling is warm water flowing over the marble from small openings all along the edges.\" Easing her back, he laid her head down and straightened her arms.\n \"Hold on to these.\" He threaded her fingers beneath a metal bar embedded at the left and right corners just above her head so her arms were stretched out to either side, at an angle just above the height of her shoulders.\n Marguerite felt the cuffs come down, snap into place over her wrists and was glad for the bars to curl her hands around.\n \"I\u0027m here, Marguerite. Don\u0027t forget that.\" His hands were on her legs now, spreading her thighs about two feet apart. Then the thigh restraints were locked down.\n Next came a band beneath her breasts, which pushed them up. He added a restraint above her breasts, compressing them. Another strap tightened securely at the waist. Her ankles were also cuffed down and now she had no mobility except her head. Almost as soon as she had the thought, she felt his hands at her neck. He buckled a strap loosely around it and then apparently clipped it to two restraining hooks on either side. He performed the same process across her forehead. Now she could no longer lift her head.\n \"Tyler...\" Her breath was moist against the edges of the mouth opening of the mask.\n His hand lowered to toy with her right breast, caress the nipple, making her want to squirm against...something. But her legs were spread. The only thing touching them was air.\n \"Tyler.\"\n \"Yes, Marguerite.\" The voice of a Master, implacable, aroused.\n \"You didn\u0027t say anything about...\" She stopped, started over. \"Why did you restrain my head?\"\n \"Because I intend to pleasure you often while you\u0027re being shaved. When you go under water, you\u0027ll be holding a tube in your mouth for air. If you should turn your head from side to side you might drop it or dip it in the water. The fit of the mask keeps the water from coming in and getting up your nose if you\u0027re relatively still. I\u0027m going to start lowering your upper body. Your hips will elevate as your head goes underwater.\n You won\u0027t be able to hear me but just remember to breathe through your mouth. If you\u0027re in distress, I have a control that will release all restraints simultaneously and bring the tablet up. Do you understand?\"\n \"Yes.\" She wondered if she was ever going to be able to stop trembling.\n He bent, placed his lips on her bare abdomen just below the point of her rib cage.\n He lingered there, stimulating the area with his lips and tongue. When he rubbed his cheek against her, she found the gesture reassuring.\n He moved closer to her head and his jeans brushed against her fingertips. When he laid his hand over hers and pressed the backs of her fingers against him, she felt his hard cock beneath the denim. \"That\u0027s what looking at you naked and spread like this does to me.\"\n She straightened her fingertips, felt the ridge of his head, prominent against the fabric. She could do this. She would. And with an unexpected feeling she refused to define as guilt or confusion, she realized that she could do it only because he was the one here, the one doing it.\n \"When your head first goes under you may feel a moment of claustrophobia. Just take deep, slow breaths through the tube. It\u0027s important that you obey me in this, obey me in all things now. You\u0027ll focus all your attention on my touch. There will be nothing but my hands in your awareness. No fear.\"\n \"How do I tell you if something is wrong, if I need to stop?\"\n \"I\u0027ll be watching you very closely.\" Tyler knew a safe word or gesture would do her no good at this juncture because everything was panicking her. He gazed at her body, vibrating with hyper-excited nerves. Her lips, the only visible feature of her face, repeatedly pressing together, moistening. Her arms, restrained out so he had access to the beautiful curves of her breasts rising above the fragile network of ribs, her legs spread open. He wondered what it would be like to keep her this way forever, at a level of arousal that would make her come again and again. Leave all her fears and worries behind. It was the first time in a long time that he\u0027d had to fight so hard against a desire to keep the woman who had agreed to submit to him. He wasn\u0027t sure if he completely had her agreement but he was going to do his best in this session to convince her that forever could be a very pleasurable word.\n \"Open your mouth.\"\n He inserted the mouthpiece of the air tube in between her teeth. \"Bite down. Not too hard. You just need to hold it a moment.\" He buckled the elastic band around her head. Her chest was rising and falling more rapidly now, he saw. He heard the rasping sound of air coming in and out of the tube.\n It was an advanced level for anyone, not just a person who resisted loss of control to the degree she did. He didn\u0027t know what instinct was driving him to push her into such an extreme sensory deprivation session so quickly, except that he\u0027d told her the truth.\n That, perversely, the experience could help calm a nervous sub once she was immersed in the stillness of the water. However, if he didn\u0027t get her there soon, she might genuinely panic and his heart wouldn\u0027t hold out against her distress.\n He also knew if he didn\u0027t start shaving her soon, change his focus, he was going to be eating her pussy until her breath became downright asthmatic, her teeth biting into the hard rubber of the tube like a rabid dog, her silken muscles rippling along his thrusting tongue. What he really wanted was to take his trousers down and drive into her, ignore the rules. He pressed the controls.\n The upper part of the tablet began to sink into the floor, taking her body down, down. The water rose to her ears, the side of her face under the mask. He watched her muscles tighten in panic, then she was immersed. He forced himself to keep her going until her body was at a forty-five degree angle and about five inches of the tube was visible. The water wavered over her, creating a beautiful mermaid image before his eyes. Her lips pressed hard on the tube but he knew she\u0027d ease up when she realized that the straps would hold it in place without her tiring her jaw.\n When he pressed another control, the section beneath her calves began to descend, a separate jointed piece of the tablet. It gave him the ability to draw a tall stool into the shallow water in the channel below her feet, move between her spread legs to her knees and study the delectable pussy completely available to him. It also gave him a clear view of her sloped out beneath him. He turned on the audio system of the room and the soft notes of Claire de Lune began as he picked up his razor and the apple-scented skin gell he\u0027d chosen. He hoped it suited her tastes, as much as her tea choice had suited his. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ice-queen-nature-of-desire-3/page-7.html","bookId":1908,"book":{"id":1908,"title":"Ice Queen (Nature of Desire #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Ice Queen (Nature of Desire #3) \n They call her the Ice Queen.
