{"id":1908,"title":"Ice Queen (Nature of Desire #3)","description":"Storyline: Ice Queen (Nature of Desire #3) \\n They call her the Ice Queen. At the exclusive BDSM club known as The Zone, Mistress Marguerite is a legend. Tyler Winterman has been fascinated with her since he\u0027s known her, though the rules of their world say they shouldn\u0027t share more than mutual admiration. He is her male counterpart, one of the most powerful male Doms practicing at The Zone. \\n Due to a computer error, Marguerite lacks the mentoring program stipulation required of all Zone Doms, which includes spending a number of hours learning about BDSM from the submissive\u0027s perspective. Tyler considers it an act of fate that Marguerite chooses him to be the Dom who helps her fulfill that requirement. He is convinced she is a \"switch\", a closet submissive, but the truth will be even more remarkable than the theory, changing their lives in ways neither of them anticipates. \\n Having no equal except one another in their skills at stripping a sub\u0027s defenses bare, these two Dominants will turn their considerable talents on each other and discover that who is Master and who is slave doesn\u0027t matter, not when two souls have found their mate.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/ice-queen-nature-of-desire-3.jpg","author":"Joey W.
