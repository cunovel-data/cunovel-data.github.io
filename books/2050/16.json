{"id":109976,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE\n Booty and the Beasts\n The second time Amy came out of the bedroom, she was dressed in her familiar hiking shorts, flip-flops, and a WHALES ARE OUR PALS T-shirt. \"Better?\"\n \"I don\u0027t feel any better, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re asking.\" Nate sat at the table with a can of grapefruit juice and a pint of vodka in front of him.\n \"I mean, are you more comfortable now that I\u0027m dressed? Because I can be naked again in a flash - \u0026raquo;\n \"You want a drink?\" Nate needed to forget the whole naked encounter as quickly as possible. Applying alcohol seemed like the most efficient method at this point.\n \"Sure,\" she said. She pulled a glass out of one of the kitchen cubbies, the clear door folding back like the protective cover of a frog\u0027s eye. \"You want a glass?\"\n Nate had been sipping alternately from the juice can and the vodka bottle until he had enough room in the can to pour in some vodka. \"Yeah. I don\u0027t like reaching into the cupboards.\"\n \"You\u0027re kind of squeamish for a biologist, but I guess it does take some getting used to.\" Amy set the glasses in front of him and let him mix the drinks. There was no ice. \"You adjust.\"\n \"You seem to have adjusted. When did they take you? You must have been really young.\"\n \"Me? No, I was born here. I\u0027ve always been here. That\u0027s why I was perfect to work for you guys. The Colonel has been teaching me cetacean biology for years.\"\n It occurred to Nate that he had seen a few human children around and hadn\u0027t really thought about growing up in Gooville. Someone had to teach them. Why not the infamous Colonel? \"I should have known. When you were trying to locate the whale by listening for it that last day. I should have known.\"\n \"Correction, when I did locate the whale by listening for it, for which you still owe me dinner.\"\n \"I think this is one of those all-bets-are-off situations, Amy. You were a spy.\"\n \"Nate, before you get too angry, you need to remember the alternative to my spying and finding out what you were working on in detail. That would have been to just kill you. It would have been much easier.\"\n \"You and Ryder act like you did me a favor. Like you saved me from some great danger. The only danger I was in was from you in the first place. So stop trying to impress me with the quality of your mercy. You did it all - tore up the lab, sank Clay\u0027s boat, all of it - didn\u0027t you?\"\n \"No, not directly. Poynter and Poe tore up the lab. The whaley boys sank Clay\u0027s boat. I took the negatives out of the packet at the photo lab. I kept them informed, and I made sure you were where they needed you to be, that\u0027s all. I never wanted to hurt you, Nate. Never.\"\n \"I wish I could believe that. Then you show up here like that, trying to convince me that this is a great place to live right after Ryder has given me the speech.\" He drained his glass, poured himself another drink, this one with just a splash of grapefruit juice over the top.\n \"What are you talking about? I haven\u0027t seen Ryder since I\u0027ve been back. I just got in a few hours ago.\"\n \"Well, then it\u0027s always been a part of the plan: Let Amy lure the biologist into staying.\"\n \"Nate, look at me.\" She took his chin in her hand and looked him right in the eye. \"I came here of my own free will, without any instructions from Ryder or anyone else. In fact, no one knows where I am, except maybe the Goo - you can never be sure about that. I came here to see you, with all the masks and the role-playing out of the way.\"\n Nate pulled away from her. \"And you didn\u0027t think I\u0027d be mad? And what was with the whole \u0027Look how luscious I am\u0027 act?\"\n She looked down. Hurt, Nate thought. Or acting hurt. If she cried, it wouldn\u0027t matter. He\u0027d be useless.\n \"I knew you\u0027d be mad, but I thought you might be able to get over it. I was just trying to be floozish. I\u0027m sorry if I\u0027m not very good at it. It\u0027s not a skill you get to use a lot in an undersea city. Truth be told, the dating pool is sort of shallow here in Gooville. I was just trying to be sexy. I never said I was a good floozy.\"\n Nate reached over and patted her hand. \"No, you\u0027re a fine floozy. That\u0027s not what I was saying. I wasn\u0027t questioning your... uh, floozishness. I was just questioning its sincerity.\"\n \"Well, it\u0027s sincere. I really do like you. I really did come here to see you, to be with you.\"\n \"Really?\" What was the biological analog for this? A black widow spider male falling for one of her lines, knowing innately where it was going. Knowing right down to his very DNA that she was going to kill and eat him right after they mated, but he would worry about after. So time and again Mr. Black Widow passed his dumb-ass, sex-enslaved genes on to the next generation of dumb-ass, sex-enslaved males who would fall for the same trick. Spinning a little conversation: Interesting name, Black Widow. How\u0027d you come about that? Tell me all about yourself. Me? Nah, I\u0027m a simple guy. I\u0027m doomed by my male nature to follow my little spider libido into oblivion. Let\u0027s talk about you. Love the red hourglass on your butt.\n \"Really,\" Amy said. There were tears welling in her eyes, and she lifted his hand to her lips and kissed it gently.\n \"Amy, I don\u0027t want to stay here. I\u0027m not - I want - I\u0027m too old for you, even if you weren\u0027t a lying, destructive, evil - \u0026raquo;\n \"Okay.\" She held his hand to her cheek.\n \"What do you mean, \u0027okay\u0027?\"\n \"You don\u0027t have to stay. But can I stay with you tonight?\"\n He pulled his hand back from her, but she held his gaze. \"I need to be way more drunk for this,\" he said.\n \"Me, too.\" She went over to the scary fridge thing. \"Do you have more vodka?\"\n \"There\u0027s another bottle over there in that thing - that other thing that I\u0027m afraid of.\" He caught himself watching her bottom while she found the bottle. \"You said \u0027okay. You mean you know a way out?\"\n \"Shut up and drink. You gonna drink or you gonna talk?\"\n \"This isn\u0027t healthy,\" Nate observed.\n \"Thank you, Dr. Insight,\" Amy said. \"Pour me one.\"\n \"Nice red hourglass.\"\n \"What?\"\n Back at his bungalow at Papa Lani, Clay sat on the bed with his head in his hands while Clair rubbed the knots out of his shoulders. He\u0027d told her the Old Broad\u0027s story, and she\u0027d listened quietly, asking a few questions as he went along.\n \"So do you believe her?\" Clair asked.\n \"I don\u0027t even know what I\u0027m admitting to believing. But I believe she thinks she\u0027s telling the truth. She offered us a boat, Clair. A ship. She offered to buy us a research vessel, hire a crew, pay them.\"\n \"What for?\"\n \"To find Nate and her husband, James.\"\n \"I thought she was broke.\"\n \"She\u0027s not broke. She\u0027s loaded. I mean, the ship will be a used one, but it\u0027s a ship. It will still run in the millions. She wants me to find one - and a crew.\"\n \"And could you find Nate if you had a ship?\"\n \"Where do I look? She thinks he\u0027s on an island somewhere, some secret place where these things live. Hell, if she\u0027s telling the truth, they could be from outer space. If she\u0027s not... well, I can\u0027t just run a ship around the world stopping at islands and asking them if they happen to have seen people crawling out of a whale\u0027s butt.\"\n \"Technically, baby, whales don\u0027t have butts. You have to walk upright to have booty. This is why we are the dominant species on the planet, because we have booty.\"\n \"You know what I mean.\"\n \"It\u0027s an important point.\" She slid into his lap, her arms around his neck.\n Clay smiled despite his anxiety. \"Technically, man is not the dominant species. There\u0027s at least a thousand pounds of termites for every person on earth.\"\n \"Well, you can have my termites, thanks.\"\n \"So man isn\u0027t really dominant, whether it\u0027s brains or booty.\"\n \"Baby, I wasn\u0027t saying that man was the dominant species, I was saying that we are the dominant species. Wo-man.\"\n \"Because you have booty?\"\n She wiggled on his lap by way of an answer, then leaned her forehead against his, looked in his eyes.\n \"Good point,\" Clay said.\n \"What about this ship? You going to let the Old Broad buy it for you? You going to go look for Nate?\"\n \"Where do I start?\"\n \"Follow one of these signals. Find whatever is making it and follow them.\"\n \"We\u0027d need location for that.\"\n \"How do you do that?\"\n \"We\u0027d need to have someone working the old sonar grid the navy put down all over the oceans during the Cold War to track submarines. I know people at Newport who do it, but we\u0027d have to tell them what we\u0027re doing.\"\n \"You couldn\u0027t just say you were trying to find a certain whale?\"\n \"I suppose we could.\"\n \"And if you have your ship and that information, you can follow the whale, or the ship, or whatever it is to its source.\"\n \"My ship?\"\n \"Roll over, I\u0027ll rub your back.\"\n But Clay wasn\u0027t moving. He was thinking. \"I still don\u0027t know where to start.\"\n \"Who has the booty? Turn over, Captain.\"\n Clay slipped off his aloha shirt and rolled over onto his stomach. \"My ship,\" he said.\n Nate was suddenly cold, and when he opened his eyes, he was pretty sure that his head was going to explode. \"I\u0027m pretty sure my head is going to explode,\" he said. And someone rudely jostled his bed.\n \"Come on, party animal, the Colonel sent for you. We need to go.\"\n He peeked between the fingers he was using to hold the pieces of his head together and saw the menacing but amused face of Cielle Nu\u0026ntilde;ez. It wasn\u0027t what - who - he expected, and he did a quick sweep of the bed with one leg to confirm that he was alone. \"I drank,\" Nate said.\n \"I saw the bottles on the table. You drank a lot.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t get a knob so just anyone could use it anytime they want.\"\n \"I noticed your knob. It looks out of place.\"\n About that time Nate realized that he was naked, and Nu\u0026ntilde;ez was standing over his naked body, and he was going to have to let the pieces of his head go where they may if he was going to cover himself. He felt for a sheet, pulled it up as he sat up and threw his legs off the bed.\n \"I\u0027m going to need a moment.\"\n \"Hurry.\"\n \"I have to pee.\"\n \"That will be fine.\"\n \"And throw up.\"\n \"Also fine.\"\n \"Okay. You go away now.\"\n \"Brush your teeth.\" And she left the room.\n Nate looked around the room for signs of Amy, but there were none. He didn\u0027t remember where her clothes were, but the last time he\u0027d seen them, he was pretty sure they weren\u0027t on her. He stumbled into the bathroom and looked into the basin, mother of pearl with its little siphon fixtures and the green sphincter drain. Seeing that pretty much did it for him, and he heaved into the sink.\n \"Hi,\" Amy said, poking her head out of the retracting shower door.\n Nate tried to say something - something about trapdoor spiders, in keeping with an arachnid theme he was developing with regard to Amy - but it came out more bubbly and moist than he intended.\n \"You go ahead,\" Amy said. \"I\u0027ll be in here.\" And the door clicked shut like a frightened clam.\n When Nate had finished reviewing the contents of his stomach, he rinsed his face and the sink, emptied his bladder into the thing on which he would not sit, then leaned against the sink and moaned for a second while he gathered his thoughts.\n A head popped out of the shower. \"So, that went well.\"\n \"The water\u0027s not running.\"\n \"I\u0027m not showering, I\u0027m hiding. I didn\u0027t want Nu\u0026ntilde;ez to see me. The Colonel shouldn\u0027t know I\u0027ve been here. I\u0027ll leave after you go. Brush your teeth.\" And then she was back in her shell.\n He brushed, rinsed, repeated, then said, \"Okay.\"\n Out she came, grabbed him by the hair, kissed him hard. \"Nice night,\" she said. The shower clicked shut, Amy inside.\n \"I\u0027m too old for this.\"\n \"Yeah, I was going to talk to you about that. Not now, later. Go. She\u0027s waiting.\"\n CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO\n The Replicator Versus\n the Imitator\n Nu\u0026ntilde;ez bought him a large cup of coffee at a cafe where whaley boys stood around pouring down lattes the size of fire extinguishers and exchanging clicks and whistles at an irritating volume.\n \"If ever there was a creature that didn\u0027t need caffeine,\" Nate said.\n Nu\u0026ntilde;ez kept him moving, while he kept trying to stop to lean on things. \"Don\u0027t ever drink with them,\" Nu\u0026ntilde;ez said. \"Especially the males. You know their sense of humor. You\u0027re as likely as not to get a wet willy in the ear, and it\u0027s a real wet willy.\"\n \"I may have to hurl again.\"\n \"Don\u0027t destroy yourself out of spite, Nate. Just accept things how they are.\"\n He wasn\u0027t trying to destroy himself, and he wasn\u0027t spiteful. He was just confused, hungover, and kind of in love, or something remotely like love, except that the pain was more localized in his temples rather than being the overall, life-ruining pain it usually caused him. \"Can we stop in at the Lollipop Guild and get a couple aspirins?\"\n \"You\u0027re late already.\"\n In the corridors she handed him off to a pair of killer whaley boys.\n \"You should be honored, you know?\" Nu\u0026ntilde;ez said. \"He doesn\u0027t meet with many people.\"\n \"You can take my appointment if you want.\"\n The Colonel had a goo recliner waiting for him when he walked through the iris door. Nate sat in it and held his coffee cup like a security blanket against his chest.\n \"Well, can you see now that life wouldn\u0027t be so bad here?\"\n Nate\u0027s mind raced. Amy said the Colonel didn\u0027t know, but maybe the Goo knew, but the Colonel was tapped in to the Goo, so did he know? Or had he sent her in the first place and this was all a scam, just like when he\u0027d sent her to Hawaii to spy on him? She\u0027d fooled him for a month there, why couldn\u0027t she be fooling him now? He wanted to trust her. But what was Ryder getting at?\n \"What\u0027s different, Growl? When I saw you nine hours ago, I was a prisoner, and I\u0027m a prisoner now.\"\n Ryder seemed surprised. He wiped the lock of gray hair out of his eyes furiously, as if it had caused him to make some sort of mistake. \"Right, nine hours. So you\u0027ve had some time to think.\" He didn\u0027t sound sure.\n \"I got drunk and passed out. In the clear, lightning-bug light of day, Colonel, I still want to go home.\"\n \"You know, time\" - Ryder patted the living chair he was sitting in as if he were petting a dog, sending waves of blush through the pink Goo outward from where he touched. Nate shivered at the sight of it - \"time is different down here, it\u0027s...\"\n \"Relative?\" Nate offered.\n \"It\u0027s on a different scale.\"\n \"What do you want from me, Colonel? What can I possibly offer you that I get the special treatment of being spared and granted multiple audiences with the... the grand pooh-bah?\" Nate was going to say \"with the alpha whacko,\" but he thought of Amy and realized that something had changed. He no longer felt like he had nothing to lose.\n Rider swiped at his hair and clutched at the flesh of his chair with the other hand. He began rocking slightly. \"I want someone to tell me I\u0027m thinking clearly, I guess. I dream things that the Goo knows, and I think it knows things that I dream, but I\u0027m not sure. I\u0027m overwhelmed.\"\n \"You might have thought about that before you declared yourself wizard.\"\n \"You think I chose this? I didn\u0027t choose this, Nate. The Goo chose me. I don\u0027t know how many people have been brought down here over the years, but I was the first biologist. I was the first one who had some idea how the Goo worked. It had the whaley boys bring me to a place like this, where there was raw, unformed animal, and it never let me leave. I\u0027ve tried to make things better for people in Gooville, but - \" Ryder\u0027s eyes rolled up in his head as if he were starting to have a seizure, but then he was back again. \"Did you see the electricity on the whale ships? I did that. But it\u0027s not - It\u0027s different now than it has been.\"\n Nate suddenly felt bad for the older man. Ryder was behaving like an early Alzheimer\u0027s patient who is realizing that he\u0027s losing recognition of his grandchildren\u0027s faces. \"Tell me,\" Nate said.\n Ryder nodded, swallowed hard, pressed on - hardly the picture of the powerful leader he\u0027d appeared the night before.\n \"I think that after the Goo found its safe haven here under the sea, it needed to have more information, more DNA sequences to make sure it could protect itself. It produced a minute bacterium that could spread throughout the oceans, be part of the great world ecosystem but could pass genetic information back to the source. We call the bacteria SAR-11. It\u0027s a thousand times smaller than normal bacteria, but it\u0027s in every liter of seawater on the planet. That worked fine to transmit information back to the Goo for three billion years - everything that could be known was in the sea. Then something happened.\"\n \"Animals left the water?\"\n \"Exactly. Until then, everything there was to know - every piece of information that could be known - was transmitted through DNA, replicators, in creatures that lived in the seas. The Goo knew everything. Mind you, it might take a million years to learn how to make an arthropod\u0027s segmented shell. It might take two million years to learn to make a gill or, say, twenty million to make an eye, but it had its safe niche, so it had the time - it didn\u0027t have anywhere it needed to be. Evolution doesn\u0027t really have a destination. It\u0027s just dicking around with possibilities. The Goo is the same way. But when life left the water, the Goo got a blind spot.\"\n \"I\u0027m having a little trouble seeing the immediacy of your story, Colonel. I mean, why, beyond the obvious that I\u0027m sitting inside this thing, is this supposed to be urgent?\"\n \"Because four hundred million years later, the land creatures came back into the water - sophisticated land animals.\"\n \"Early whales?\"\n \"Yes, when mammals came back to the sea, they brought something that even the dinosaurs - the reptiles and amphibians that had come back to the water - didn\u0027t have. Something the Goo didn\u0027t know. Knowledge that didn\u0027t replicate itself through DNA. It replicated through imitation, learned knowledge, not passed on. Memes.\"\n Nate knew about memes, the information equivalent of a gene. A gene existed to replicate itself and required a vehicle, an organism, in which to do it. It was the same with memes, except a meme could replicate itself across vehicles, across brains. A tune you couldn\u0027t get out of your head, a recipe, a bad joke, the Mona Lisa - all were memes of sort. They were a fun model to think about, and computers had made the idea of a self-replicating piece of information more manifest with computer viruses, but what did that have to do with - But then it hit him. Why he\u0027d learned about memes in the first place.\n \"The song,\" Nate said. \"Humpback song is a meme.\"\n \"Of course. The first culture, the first exposure the Goo had to something it didn\u0027t understand. What, maybe fifteen million years ago it found out it wasn\u0027t the only game in town. Three billion years is a long time to get used to living in what you think is your private house only to suddenly find out that someone moved into an apartment above you while you were sleeping.\n \"For a long time the Goo didn\u0027t perceive that genes and memes were at odds. Whales were the first carriers. Big brains because they need to imitate complex behaviors, remember complex tasks, and because they could get the high-protein food to build the brains the memes needed. But the Goo came to terms with the whales. They\u0027re an elegant mix of genes and memes, absolute kings of their realm. Huge, efficient feeders, immune from any predation except from each other.\n \"But then something started killing whales. Killing them in alarming numbers. And it was something from the surface world. It wasn\u0027t something the Goo could find out about from its ocean-borne nervous system, so that\u0027s when I think it created the whale ships, or a version of them. Late seventeen or early eighteen hundreds, I\u0027d guess. Then, I think when it had somehow gotten back enough samples of human DNA, it made the whaley boys. To stay camouflaged but to watch, to bring people back here so it could learn, watch us. I may have been the final link that started the war.\"\n \"What war? There\u0027s a war?\" Nate had a quick vision of the paranoid megalomaniacs that the Colonel said he\u0027d considered for pseudonyms, Captain Nemo and Colonel Kurtz, both complete bedbugs.\n \"The war between memes and genes. Between an organism that specializes in the replication of gene machines - the Goo - and one that specializes in the replication of meme machines - us, human beings. I brought electrical and computer technology here. I brought the Goo the theoretical knowledge of memes and genes and how they work. Where the Goo is now and where it was before I came is the difference between being able to drive one and being able to build a car from lumps of raw steel. It\u0027s realizing the threat. It\u0027s going to figure it out.\"\n Ryder looked at Nate expectantly. Nate looked at him as if he wasn\u0027t getting the point. When he\u0027d studied under Ryder, the man had been so cogent, so clear. Grumpy, but clear. \"Okay,\" Nate said slowly, hoping Ryder would jump in, \"so you need me to... uh...?\"\n \"Help me figure out a way to kill it.\"\n \"Didn\u0027t see that coming.\"\n \"We\u0027re at war with the Goo, and we have to find a way to kill it before it knows what\u0027s happening.\"\n \"Then don\u0027t you think you should keep your voice down?\"\n \"No, it doesn\u0027t communicate that way.\" The Colonel looked perturbed at Nate\u0027s comment.\n \"So you want me to figure out how to kill your god?\n \"Yes, before it wipes out the human race in one fell swoop.\"\n \"Which would be bad.\"\n \"And we have to kill it without killing everyone in Gooville.\"\n \"Oh, we can do that,\" Nate said, completely confident, the way he\u0027d seen hostage negotiators in cop movies tell the bank robbers that their demands were being met and the helicopter was on the way. \"But I\u0027m going to need some time.\"\n The strangest thing was, as Nate left the Colonel\u0027s chamber after being in direct contact with the Goo for only a few minutes, his hangover was completely gone. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fluke-or-i-know-why-the-winged-whale-sings/page-16.html","bookId":2050,"book":{"id":2050,"title":"Fluke, or, I Know Why the Winged Whale Sings","description":"Storyline: \n In his entertaining adventure-in-whale-researching, Fluke, or, I Know Why the Winged Whale Sings, Nathan Quinn, a prominent marine biologist, has been conducting studies in Hawaii for years trying to unravel the secret of why humpback whales sing.
