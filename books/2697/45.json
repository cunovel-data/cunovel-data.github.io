The permit application cut off date is tomorrow anyway. “While I applaud your loyalty… You know you can trust me. Keeping secrets is an official part of my job.” Dillon raised an eyebrow. “Or I can guess if you’d like. I’ve got a good idea what you’ve been tasked to do, given your field of study.” “Was I assigned this job because of your recommendation?” she asked sharply. “No. So why don’t you tell me what it is?” She sighed. “I’m processing applications and then screening applicants’ land for the elk farm test program.” “Really? Congrats on landing a big project because it’s an important program to the state. How’s it going so far?” “Busy. I didn’t think we’d get so many applicants.” “With the drought, ranchers have been forced to cut down their herds. Everyone is looking for replacement income. I imagine you’re getting applications from ranchers whose land fits the criteria, but have no intention of turning it into an elk farm.” “The director mentioned that to me. I’m hoping he’s wrong and all these applications are legit.” After she’d calmed down following the confrontation with Dalton, she wished she’d had the presence of mind to ask if his application was legit. Yes, she’d shown up at his place loaded for bear, but she stood by everything she’d said—on a professional level. On a personal level? Well, she’d have to wait and see. She tuned back in to Dillon’s commentary. He hadn’t noticed her momentary blip in concentration. “…it’s been interesting seeing it from a different angle. Any chance this temporary position could roll over into fulltime?” “Doubtful. This WNRC office is fully staffed. I’ll return to my previous part-time position once I’m finished.” Dillon looked thoughtful. “Did you take this job because it’s in your hometown?” Tempting to lie, but she admitted, “No. It was the only job available.” On such short notice. “Except for the job you already had at the Wyoming State Parks.” “That wasn’t a permanent position.” “I had the pull to make it permanent,” Dillon reminded her. Didn’t he understand that’s why she’d left? She’d be stuck there with him? At least working here part-time she had options. “It was best if we didn’t work together after…” Silence ensued. Dillon sighed. “You broke it off with me without really much of a reason why.” Rory’s eyes narrowed. “Is that why you’re here? To get answers?” “Maybe. Things were going great between us and the next thing I knew, you returned the engagement ring and left town.” Going great. Right. “Look, this isn’t the time or the place—” “Then have dinner with me tonight so we can discuss it.” Crap. She’d fallen right into that one. “You owe me that much, Rory. I also wanted to mention new career opportunities for you, but it wouldn’t be prudent to discuss them in your current place of business.” He knew that would intrigue her. “Is there a quiet place we can have dinner and a conversation?” “The Twin Pines is a supper club outside of Sundance.” “Sounds good to me. Will six o’clock work?” “Yes, that’ll give me time to change.” “You’d look beautiful wearing a flour sack.” Dillon’s compliment, while sincere, didn’t affect her the same way Dalton’s compliments did. “Thank you.” He smiled and stood. “Looking forward to seeing you at six. I’ll let you get back to work.” He left her office. Rory didn’t take waste time dwelling on how their discussion would play out tonight. She had plenty to accomplish before then. Three raps on her door and Glennis poked her head in. “Rory? Can I come in?” “Sure. What do you need?” “Just checking on whether…” She sighed. “Okay, I’m a snoopy busybody and I’m dying to know if that man really was your ex-fiancé.” That startled her. “That’s how Dillon introduced himself?” “He said he was Dillon Doland, assistant director for the Wyoming State Parks and he used to work with you. Then he chuckled and mentioned he’d been engaged to you.” “I find it weird he’d say that.” Glennis’s gaze sharpened behind her glasses. “Know what I find weird? That Dillon has more than a passing similarity to Dalton. Tall, dark-haired, blue eyes. Charming.” “Which describes half the men in the world,” she retorted. Glennis shook her finger. “Maybe you didn’t realize at the time you’d started something with Dillon because he reminded you of Dalton.” “Bullshit.” “I know you and Dalton have a history, Rory.” “How?” she demanded. “Because of your familiarity the first day he sauntered in here. And sweetie, I am a Sundance native. I’ve got a grasp of geography and I know you grew up practically next door to his family’s ranch.” She crossed her arms over her chest. “Does Dalton have any idea that you almost married a man who looks like him?” “No.” “What do you think he’ll do when he finds out?” Rory stared at the door after Glennis left. She was wrong. Her attraction to Dillon had nothing to do with his looks and that he had some of the same physical characteristics as Dalton. Did it? And besides, didn’t all women have a type that appealed to them? Tall, dark-haired, blue-eyed men did it for her. Putting it out of her mind, she got back to work. Dillon was waiting by the hostess stand at the Twin Pines when Rory arrived. He pulled her in for a hug and brushed a kiss on her cheek. “Rory. You look beautiful.” She’d put extra effort into her appearance, wearing a form-fitting dress in dark pink, topping it with an iridescent shawl she’d crocheted herself and finishing her bohemian look with bone-colored riding boots. “You look stylish, as usual.” He’d worn a navy suit jacket, blue and white striped shirt, jeans and loafers. One thing about Dillon; he was always impeccably put together. Even after spending all day out inspecting parks land on horseback, he’d return to the office in the same condition he’d left. “Hey, Rory.” Naomi the manager looked between her and Dillon with a frown. As if she’d expected to see her with Dalton. Rory bristled. She could have a business dinner with whoever she wanted. And the only reason she was here was because Dillon might have a lead on a job or two for her. Naomi led them to a table in the middle of the restaurant. “I know you prefer a booth, but this is all I’ve got at last minute. As you can see we’re swamped tonight.” Dillon pulled out her chair. “Thanks.” To Naomi she said, “What’s going on?” “The Wyoming Wildfire band is playing on the club side. That gets people out on a Thursday night. Enjoy.” “I take it that’s a popular band around here?” Dillon asked. “Hugely popular. They only do one-night gigs, so they always play to packed houses.” “Makes good business sense. The band I played in in college should’ve done that.” “You were in a band?” “Cover tunes only. I played bass.” “You never mentioned that.” “There’s a lot you don’t know about me. If you don’t mind, I’d like to head over after dinner and listen.” Rory agreed only because Dillon didn’t dance. She checked to see who was bartending before deciding on a cosmopolitan. After they ordered and the drinks were delivered, Rory got right to the point. “I call bullshit on you just being in the neighborhood, Dil.” “I am on WSP business. Headed to Buffalo and Sheridan to discuss a more detailed operating plan for the summer season. Part of the plan is to integrate the new with the old since two positions will be opening up. Fulltime positions. Habitat management in Sheridan and assistant park services manager in Buffalo.” “Are they new positions? Or vacancies?” “New position in Sheridan. In Buffalo the park services manager is retiring, his assistant is moving up to fill the position so we’re hiring outside the office for a replacement.” Dillon sipped his drink. “Do either of those sound like something you’d be interested in?” “Both, actually. When will the openings be listed?” “Now. Final selection in roughly six weeks.” That would work out perfectly. She’d be done with the special project. “What else?” “What do you mean?” Rory poked his forearm. “There’s something you’re not telling me. So spill it.” “You’re right, but it’s not about either of those jobs. Strictly between us, there will be an opening in the Cody BLM office. Fulltime in Ag management.” BLM usually hired and promoted from within the organization before they opened up outside applications. “Why?” “The guy is retiring. The only catch…this position is pretty much universally hated by everyone in the community.” “Is that why the guy is getting out?” “No, but it is why no one in that branch office has applied for the job and why the BLM is listing the position on the job boards next week.” Rory drummed her fingers on the table. “Think the locals’ attitudes would be worse if a woman took over the BLM job?” “Any woman besides you? Yes. But I’ve seen you in action, Rory. You can be coy and forceful. Most people don’t realize they’ve given you exactly what you want until they walk away.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/redneck-romeo-rough-riders-15/page-45.html","bookId":2697,"book":{"id":2697,"title":"Redneck Romeo (Rough Riders #15)","description":"Storyline: Redneck Romeo (Rough Riders #15) The last McKay standing is knocked to his knees… Three years ago, Dalton McKay looked across the altar and saw the woman he knew he’d love for the rest of his life…only it wasn’t his bride.
