Sometimes I just look at all this—” her hands slowly cruised down his chest, stopping on his abdomen above his pelvis, “—and I’m blown away that it’s all mine.” Dalton’s fingers on her chin lifted her face to look into her eyes. “Are you admitting you own me every bit as much as I own you?” Her this-is-just-sex side didn’t even bother to speak up anymore. Nor did it lodge a protest when she said, “Yes.” “Need to get you home. Now,” he said in that low, dangerously sexy growl. She swept her lips over his in a fleeting kiss. “Hold that thought. I won so I get to pick the next activity.” Took every ounce of restraint to step back instead of closer. “I hope it’s wrestling.” She laughed. “Nope. But it does begin with a W.” “There ain’t a pool in there so it doesn’t have to do with water.” “It’s weight lifting. You lift; I get to watch.” “Why in the hell would you wanna watch me lift weights? Lots of grunting, straining, sweating.” His eyes narrowed. “Get that look off your face, jungle girl. It’s not even close to sex and it sure ain’t sexy.” “I’ll be the judge of that, won’t I? It’ll be interesting to see you pump something besides me for a change.” So she’d never actually watched a lover working out with weights before. Oh, sure, she’d seen guys lifting weights in the gym. Quite a few of them had amazingly hot bodies, but it hadn’t affected her beyond her appreciation for the strength and beauty of a buffed up masculine form. But watching Dalton pumping iron? Whole. Different. Story. Seeing his biceps and triceps flexing and glistening with sweat. Taking in every inch of his bulky forearms. Seeing the strain across his shoulders beneath his T-shirt as he pulled on the weight and pulley thing. Watching the V ripple in his quads as he performed squats and that also caused the thick bulge in his calf to contract. Wasn’t like Dalton paid attention to her attentiveness to him. He remained focused on each exercise and when it ended he’d move to the next one. He didn’t watch his weightlifting form in the mirror like she’d seen so many other gym rats do. No admiring smug glances as he stared at himself. She knew he’d started working out in hotel fitness facilities as a way to stave off boredom before poker tournaments. It wasn’t like Dalton was overly muscular with biceps bigger than her waist or his own neck. He needed that strength in his logging job. He didn’t work out to impress anyone, although that cut, ripped and toned body was an impressive benefit. For her. “Christ, Rory, stop doin’ that.” Her gaze moved from his butt to his eyes. “Stop doing what?” “Licking your lips.” “Uh, I wouldn’t be licking my chops, cowboy, if you didn’t have the very finest chops I’ve ever seen.” “And all the times we’ve been nekkid together, what? You weren’t lookin’ at me?” He set down the dumbbells and perched on the edge of the weight bench. “I look at you plenty. Touch you plenty.” She sauntered forward. “I still don’t get the point of this. You’ve been watchin’ me lifting for half an hour.” Rory straddled his legs and lowered herself onto his lap. Dalton’s hands circled her hips to steady her. “Whoa, sugarplum, what are you doin’?” She licked a rivulet of sweat from the hollow of his throat up to the edge of his jaw. “Having a little taste of you.” “So does that mean we’re done here?” “No.” She sucked on his earlobe before she blew in his ear. “It’s late. We’re probably the only ones left in the whole place.” “Which means it’s time for us to go home.” “I can feel you getting hard,” she breathed against his damp skin. She inhaled a lungful of him and sighed. “You smell delicious. Your muscles are so pumped up right now. I bet you could lift a small truck, couldn’t you?” “Uh…yeah. I guess.” She slipped her hand between them and lightly stroked his nipple as she strung kisses down the column of his throat. “Just looking at you gets me hot. I suspected it’d be sexy watching you pumping iron, but I had no idea it’d make me so wet.” Rory sank her teeth into the warm, salty section of skin where shoulder curved into neck. “So very, very wet and ready.” “Woman, unless you want me to pin you to this weight bench and fuck you, you’d better take it down a notch.” Rory pulled his hair, yanking his head back when he attempted to nudge her away from his neck. “I was thinking more of you fucking me in the storage closet. But this weight bench will work.” She nibbled the edge of his jaw up to his ear. “Or even the ping pong table.” He groaned when her lips hit the spot that made him shiver. “You are—” “A master at great ideas. I know.” She flicked her tongue across the spot just to feel him shudder again. “So where’s it gonna be, power lifter?” “Closet.” With his hands on her ass, he pushed upright and carried her to the far corner of the room. He set her on the floor and she turned to open the door. Once they were crammed into the tiny space, she didn’t bother to turn on the light. The storage closet held the usual cleaning supplies and stacks of folded towels on the shelving. “How’d you know about this place?” Dalton asked against the back of her neck. “Found it when I was looking for something for my yoga class. God, do that again.” “This?” He used his teeth on her nape. “Yes… Wait.” “No waiting. Jeans off. Panties off.” So much for being in control. No, you do have control. “Your shirt comes off too.” She only managed to get naked from the waist down before Dalton’s hard, damp muscle-bound body was crowding her. “I’m fucking you against the wall, baby.” His deep voice vibrated from her ear straight to her clit. “But first, since you’ve been teasing me about how wet you are—” his big hand cupped her mound and two fingers slid down her pussy to her opening, “—I’d better make sure.” Then he plunged his fingers inside her. In and out. Twice. “Fuck yeah. You are dripping wet for me.” Rory drifted into that floaty space, where her body was primed, her senses were attuned to the heat and scent of his body. He removed his fingers and she held her breath, waiting for that first hard thrust. But his fingers touched her lips. “Open your mouth.” She parted her lips and he slipped those slick digits onto her tongue. She tasted the muskiness of her sex and the salt on Dalton’s fingers. His sexy, raspy voice exploded in her ear. “Suck like you were sucking my cock.” Rory hollowed her cheeks. With his fingers all but vacuum-sealed, she sucked hard. “That’s it.” Dalton dragged openmouthed kisses down her throat as she sucked and swallowed. “Fucking love that you’re a dirty girl. Sucking your come from my fingers. So crazy to fuck me that you drag me into a damn storage closet.” He wiggled his fingers free from her mouth and smashed their lips together in a mind-bending, orgasm-inducing kiss. He broke free long enough to demand, “Jump up and hold on.” One leg up, both legs up and then her thighs were circling his waist. Dalton pressed her against the cold cement wall with the sheer strength in his body. Holding her ass cheeks in his hands, he tilted her pelvis and plowed in to the hilt. Her nails dug into his shoulders. Each powerful snap of his hips had her clinging to him more tightly, gasping more loudly. The only noises coming out of his mouth were grunts and labored breaths. The heat from his chest seeped through her shirt making her wish for better skin on skin contact. Then his hips started the side-to-side grinding motion. “This’ll get you there. Move on me. Take it. I’m so close I won’t last much longer.” “Know what’ll get me there?” “What?” “Whisper dirty things in my ear.” “You like that?” he asked, slamming into her. “When I tell you this hot, wet cunt is sucking on my cock like you do when you deep throat me? My cock is so slippery with your juices they’re running down my leg.” He let his tongue trace the shell of her ear. “Hottest fucking thing in the world would be to see you on your knees lapping up that sweet juice on the inside of my thigh and then that wicked tongue of yours licking my dick clean.” “Oh God. Faster.” “You’d do that for me, wouldn’t you, dirty girl?” “Yes. Please just…” Rory threw her head back as the throbbing in her groin started, pulsing around Dalton’s shaft from her clit rubbing against the hard ridge of his pubic bone. “Fuck, I’m done.” Dalton drove in one last time. Her tissues were so sensitive, still tingling from her climax, that she felt every hot spurt shooting from his cock. He shuddered in her arms. This man gave her his all every time, in so many ways. Dalton leaned back and locked his gaze to hers. “I guess a date playing ping pong is more romantic than I gave it credit for.” Chapter Twenty-Seven Dalton was finishing his second cup of coffee at seven a.m. when he heard the knock on the door. He half-expected to see Rory standing on the steps. Holding a box of doughnuts and wearing that I-want-to-bang-you smile. But the grin he had in place vanished at seeing Brandt and Tell on the other side of the door. “What?” They pushed past him and they faced each other in the entryway. Both his brothers looked like hell.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/redneck-romeo-rough-riders-15/page-60.html","bookId":2697,"book":{"id":2697,"title":"Redneck Romeo (Rough Riders #15)","description":"Storyline: Redneck Romeo (Rough Riders #15) The last McKay standing is knocked to his knees… Three years ago, Dalton McKay looked across the altar and saw the woman he knew he’d love for the rest of his life…only it wasn’t his bride.
