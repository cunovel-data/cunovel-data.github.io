As he stood naked before her, his rush of masculine power had vanished, leaving him feeling vulnerable. “Dalton,” she whispered, trapping his face in her hands, “Talk to me.” “I love you.” Rory blinked at him. “I love you and the thought of losing you, of you walking away from me because I’m not the man you want…makes me crazy. It keeps me up at night. I’ve changed. But have I changed enough so you believe—” She kissed him. “You are the man I want. Just you. I’m here with you and there’s no place I’d rather be.” He traced her swollen lips with the pad of his thumb. “I was rough. I’m sorry.” “Then you’d better kiss it and make it better, huh?” Dalton kissed her. Touched her. Showed her. She responded in that sweet melting way she always did, giving herself over to him completely. After he’d removed her clothes and they were stretched out on his bed, skin to skin, heart to heart, he said, “You’re mine, jungle girl. Only ever mine. I’m never letting you get away from me again.” Her satisfied moans rang in his ears as he showed her twice just how much he loved her. “I’m still mad at you.” Dalton’s gaze moved over her naked body. Lingered on her sex-mussed hair. Then he lifted that one dark eyebrow. “I can tell.” Rory shoved him. He laughed. “You can be mad at me more often if that’s how we work out our differences.” He leaned forward and placed a tender kiss on the cup of her shoulder. “That was…mmm.” “Mmm? What’s mmm?” “The sexual hum of a satisfied man. Mmm. I make that sound a lot around you. Thought you’d recognize it.” He propped himself up on his elbow and traced her nipple with his fingertip. “I don’t have a bunch of smooth words. What’s between us defies description. I never knew it could be like that. And it’s like that between us every damn time.” Don’t know any smooth words, my ass. “So why don’t you go on and get your mad worked out. I can take it.” She sighed. “Why didn’t you tell me you applied for a permit?” “Why didn’t you tell me you were processing the applications?” he countered. “Because it was supposed to be kept under wraps. But the people in the office knew what I was working on—I blame Hannah for trying to sabotage me. And the way I told you…” She shuddered. “I wasn’t supposed to tell you at all. Not only because I thought it’d cause problems between us. I know most ranchers—especially the McKays—are against this program.” “True.” He stroked the upper swell of her breast with the back of his knuckles. “But somehow you forgot that I’m not a rancher anymore.” “Also true.” “And we don’t talk about our jobs. Me, mostly because I don’t have one. So can we have a rational discussion about what happened?” “While we’re naked?” “Yep.” “Fine. When I showed up on Monday, why did you assume your family had something to do with me learning about your application?” “Because I had a big goddamned fight with them about it on Sunday after the poker game.” As Dalton told her what’d happened with the McKays, she felt even worse for how she’d handled it with him. “I’m sorry. I was way less than professional.” He tipped her chin up and looked into her eyes. “Wasn’t your lack of professionalism that bothered me. I thought things had changed between us. That you understood I’d changed. But you believed the worst of me from the get-go, and I ain’t gonna lie. Pissed me off more than it hurt me. At first.” Rory curled into him, resting her head on his chest and trying to wrap herself around him. “I’m sorry. This isn’t an excuse for the way I behaved, but seeing your application caught me off guard. I figured your family would apply in the hopes of getting selected so they could tank the program. But you’re serious about this.” “Completely. Since I’ve been gone for three years I had no idea what’d been goin’ on with the laws until I saw it in the newspaper. I was really shocked to read the elk farm pilot program had made it through the Wyoming legislature and the lawmakers hadn’t bowed to the livestock producers’ demands and killed it in committee again.” “Took them long enough. You should see the book of regulations just for the temporary permit.” “I’m sure the regulations are brutal—I don’t envy you that—I’m just happy this trial might end the stranglehold that Yellowstone and The Tetons have had on the feeding grounds.” She drew circles on his chest. “So this application isn’t a whim for you? And right now, I’m not asking as a WNRC employee, but as your…” Lover? Girlfriend? “As my what, Rory?” “As the woman who has humbly asked your forgiveness.” Her response didn’t make him happy, especially in light of the fact he’d confessed his love for her. “I didn’t plan on staying here when I first left Montana. Then my priorities changed and the elk farm opportunity caught my eye. I’ve done the research. It’d give me something to do here instead of returning to ranching.” Dalton’s palm skated down her arm. “My brothers are on board with my idea. One hundred percent. Even though the rest of the McKays are not.” “I’m surprised they’re giving you full support.” “I’m not. If I get awarded the permit, it’d give me a reason to stay and be part of the family again.” Rory tried not to freeze up. She tried to keep her breathing steady. She tried not to think about what that statement meant. An ugly, horrible thought occurred to her. For once in their relationship, she had all the power. Her decision would determine whether or not he stayed. Dalton’s hand cupped her face and he tilted her head back so he could look at her. “I’ve gotta know that you’re gonna give me a fair shot.” She kissed the base of his thumb. “It’s good that this is out in the open. But it can’t all be out in the open. There are things I can’t talk about, Dalton.” “You mean things about your job that you can’t talk about, right?” “Ah, right.” Dalton knew she was hedging but he allowed it. “Are we done talkin’ for now?” “Sure. Why?” “’Cause we’ve still got a lot of kissin’ and makin’ up to do.” In the past ten days since their big blow up, Dalton and Rory had stuck to the parameters of not discussing specifics of her job. But he wondered if she had anyone to talk to about work-related stuff, because she was really stressed. She’d barely touched her lunch. “You gonna finish them fries?” Rory slid the plate at him. “I told you not to order a salad because you’d be hungry.” “I ordered a salad because you never finish all your food and I hate to see it go to waste.” She didn’t say anything funny or cute in response, which wasn’t like her. She tapped her fingers on the table and stared into space. “Something wrong?” “Not looking forward to my next inspection.” Dalton picked up her restless hand. “Want me to come with you? I’ll knock the guy around if he disrespects you.” “Bizarrely sweet offer, so thank you, but I have to fight my own battles. I just wish there weren’t so damn many of them.” “That’s all it’s been this week?” She nodded. “And last week.” “I promise you no battles when you inspect my land.” He kissed her knuckles. “But the offer stands if you need a bodyguard when you’re makin’ your rounds. ’Cause sugarplum, you know how much I love your body.” “Same goes.” A naughty smile curled her lips. “But anytime you wanna dress like a bodyguard in a tight black T-shirt, black camo pants, a leather jacket and badass don’t-fuck-with-me sunglasses…well, cowboy, you just go right ahead.” Dalton laughed. A shadow fell across them and they both looked up. His cousins Cord and Colt stood at the end of the table. Awesome. Dalton hadn’t seen them since the poker game and didn’t know what he’d say to them. Cord smiled at Rory. “Hey, Rory. Haven’t seen you in a while. How’ve you been?” “Good. How’re things with you?” “Can’t complain.” Cord looked at Dalton. “Dalton.” “Cord.” “We didn’t mean to interrupt your lunch,” Colt said. Like hell. “I need to get to work so you can have my spot and keep Dalton company while he eats that piece of bread pudding he’s been eyeing.” Rory paused. “Unless you’re here to gang up on him? I’ll stick around in case it gets heated.” Dalton loved that she had his back. “We ain’t gonna gang up on him,” Cord said. “Good.” She leaned across the table and mock whispered, “Lucky for them that I don’t have to break out my kung fu moves in defense of you, huh?” He couldn’t help but laugh; she cracked his ass up. When Rory slipped out of the booth, Dalton stood and tugged her into his arms. After kissing her soundly he said, “Be careful out there.” “I will.” “Let me know if you’re up for doin’ anything tonight.” “Always.” Rory gave him another quick peck. She reached for her coat. “Later, McKays.” “See ya, Rory.” Then Cord looked at Dalton. “Got a minute to talk?”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/redneck-romeo-rough-riders-15/page-49.html","bookId":2697,"book":{"id":2697,"title":"Redneck Romeo (Rough Riders #15)","description":"Storyline: Redneck Romeo (Rough Riders #15) The last McKay standing is knocked to his knees… Three years ago, Dalton McKay looked across the altar and saw the woman he knew he’d love for the rest of his life…only it wasn’t his bride.
