Except we’re the strippers.” He kissed her. “Linoleum strippers.”\n Kyler snorted.\n Rory smiled at him, then at Kyler. “Hey, Kyler. How’d you get roped into helping with this?”\n Kyler gave Dalton an odd look.\n “Let’s just call it McKay community service,” Dalton said with a straight face.\n The kid snorted again.\n Dalton reached out to run his hand down Rory’s hair, but he caught a glimpse of his dirty fingers and dropped his hand by his side. “Kyler was telling me he’s got a football game this weekend.”\n “I heard the people in the office talking about it,” Rory said. “It’s the big district playoff game. You ready to take the team to victory, superstar quarterback?”\n Kyler blushed. “If we win, it’ll be a team effort.”\n “He’s so modest.” Rory draped her arm over Dalton’s neck. “What Kyler hasn’t mentioned? He’s been the starting quarterback since his freshman year and he’s taken the Sundance football team to the state finals the last two years.”\n “We’ve made it to the finals but we haven’t won,” Kyler pointed out.\n “He’s also been named to the all-state team. The western U.S. all-conference team and he’s in the top one hundred on the national who’s who list of high school athletes. College scouts are sniffing around too.”\n Kyler blushed even harder and stood. “Where’d you hear all that?”\n “Sierra. I talked to her last night. I’m pretty sure she was doing herkeys while she was bragging on your athletic prowess.”\n “Sierra exaggerates. Anyway, it’s just high school football. Not like I’m a professional athlete like Chase. Or a professional poker player like Dalton, which is way cooler and takes a whole lotta skill and strategy.”\n Dalton tugged on Rory’s hair. “See? Kyler knows Texas Hold’em requires skill more than luck.”\n Rory rolled her eyes.\n Kyler looked appalled. “Dude. Seriously? She thinks it’s a game of…luck?” He said luck as if it were a dirty word.\n Dalton shrugged. “I’ve tried to explain it but she won’t change her mind. Anyway, good luck with your football game this weekend.”\n “Thanks.” He skirted the breakfast bar and snagged his iPod. “I’d probably better get walkin’.”\n “You don’t want a ride?”\n “Nah.” Kyler slipped on his coat. “Since we didn’t have football practice today I need some cardio. I’ll get plenty of lifting exercise when I start chores.”\n Dalton moved in front of Kyler as he shouldered his backpack. He dug thirty bucks from his front pocket and held it out. “I appreciate your help today, Kyler.”\n “But…I didn’t expect this.”\n “And I don’t expect free labor. Now you’ve got a little extra to take your girl out and show her off.” He grinned. “Or to put in a new battery in that truck of yours so you don’t get busted again.”\n “Thanks, Dalton.” He folded the bills and tucked them in his pocket. “You want me here next Wednesday?”\n “If it doesn’t interfere with football practice.”\n “It won’t.” He leaned in and said, “Maybe you oughta follow your own advice. Take Rory out and show her off, ’cause man, she is totally hot. You are so lucky to get with her.” Kyler stepped aside, gifting Rory with a smile to rival the devil’s. “See ya, Rory.” He slipped out the door.\n Rory sighed. “There’s the first in another generation of devastatingly handsome and charming McKay males.”\n “He’s a good kid. Sounds like Cord’s got a tight leash on him. It’ll be interesting to see what happens when Kyler breaks that leash, ’cause we all do at some point.” Dalton turned around and Rory was right there. “Hey.”\n “Hey yourself, cowboy.”\n “I’m glad you’re here.” He kissed her sweetly, lazily, letting the simple pleasure of kissing her whenever the hell he wanted wash through him. He ended the kiss with soft brushes of his lips over hers.\n “I liked that. Do it again.”\n “In a sec.” He gazed into her beautiful eyes. “I need to clean myself up. Then what would you like to do tonight?”\n “I’d like you to take me to bed.”\n “Besides that.”\n Rory’s eyes turned thoughtful. “I don’t know. What is there to do? Since I’ve been back in Sundance I either worked at the Twin Pines or I stayed home. I’m not in the mood to hang out in a bar, are you?”\n “Not really.”\n “What would you be doing if you were in Montana?”\n “If I’m bored I head out and shoot practice rounds. Not much else to do in the woods except improve my marksmanship.” When she didn’t respond, he said, “Sugarplum, why you lookin’ at me like that?”\n “It’s just weird. I know you’ve hunted since you were a boy and you must be a good to be a professional guide. But in all the years I’ve known you, when we played Tarzan and Jane, pirates, and pioneers, we never played cowboys and Indians, or Bonnie and Clyde; I’ve never seen you holding a weapon—for real or pretend.”\n Dalton bristled. “It bothers you that I’ve held a gun and a bow and killed animals with these hands?”\n Rory lifted his hands and traced the outside of his fingers. “No. I love your hands. I love your hands on me. You’re so gentle, tender and thorough. You’re also rough and exacting.”\n “But?”\n “But nothing. My poorly made point is that there are things we don’t know about each other. Like how we spend our free time.”\n “Aren’t we past the testing phase? Where we each have to list our likes and dislikes?”\n “You’re missing my point, Dalton.”\n “You’re missing mine, Rory. I want to fuck you twenty-four/seven. And we pretty much have been doin’ that since Friday night. But that’s not enough for either of us. We need to make sure we like each other out of bed, too. Which is why we’re gonna do something else tonight besides fuck each other’s brains out.”\n She wrinkled her nose. “Who are you again?”\n He laughed and kissed her pouting mouth. “Won’t take me long to clean up. You wanna head home, deal with your dog and I’ll show up at your place in an hour?”\n “Sounds good. Except for the waiting an hour part. Because I’m not waiting for what I want.”\n “Rory—”\n “Aurora,” she corrected as she herded him against the wall. “That’s what you call me when we’re getting busy, remember?” Her mouth started a southerly path from behind his ear as she unbuttoned his shirt.\n “We’re not getting busy, remember?”\n “I disagree. And if I really think about your we’re not having sex tonight edict, I might get pissed off. I have a say in when we have sex too, don’t forget that.”\n He liked this aggressive side of her and she did have a point. “I need a shower. Been sweating outside and inside all day and—”\n “I don’t care.” She licked his neck from the hollow of his throat to the bottom edge of his jaw and back down. “I like how your skin tastes.” She dragged her fingers down his torso to the waistband of his jeans. “How your body feels beneath my hands.”\n By the time she palmed his cock through the denim he was completely erect. “Why’re you doin’ this now?”\n “Remember on Monday night when I showed up here after my yoga class? You saw me in yoga pants and couldn’t keep your greedy hands off me?” She rubbed her lips over the stubble on his jaw line.\n “Ah. Yeah.” Her lips were so soft on his face but her hand stroked his cock firmly through his jeans.\n “Same thing hit me when I saw you in this sexy flannel shirt, looking all manly, holding tools and shit. I just wanna take a big bite outta you, Dalton McKay. So you’re gonna let me.”\n And he was done for. Done for.\n Rory had unbuckled his belt and undone his zipper before his brain and mouth connected. Then she was on her knees yanking down his jeans and boxers. That warm, wet mouth enveloped his cock and his brain ceased functioning entirely.\n She did twisty things with her tongue that…damn. She did that sucking thing with her cheeks…Christ. Then she tried to deep throat him and he shouted, “Fuck.”\n “Yes. Fuck me.” She brought his shaft into her mouth again and released him. “Fuck my mouth.”\n “No. I want to fuck your sweet pussy in my bed.”\n “No. Fuck my sweet pussy right here against the wall. Ditch the boots and jeans.” She stood. Shucking off her pants and underwear, she watched him to make sure he did the same.\n As soon as his legs were free, Rory’s mouth was on his. She spun until her back was against the wall. She wrapped her arm around his neck and her leg around his hip.\n He marveled at the strength in her thigh muscles for about three seconds. Then her hand gripped the base of his cock and she—holy shit—pulled him forward with it. Yeah. She was not messing around. Dalton knew she wasn’t messing around when the head of his cock brushed the wetness of her pussy. She wanted this. She was ready for this.\n Who was he to deny her?\n He bent his knees and filled her in one thrust.\n Her head fell back. “Like that again.”\n So he did it again. And again. And again.\n No kissing, no touching. Just raw fucking.\n Rory’s hand landed on his butt in almost a slap and she urged his pelvis closer. “Grind on me. Yes. More. Feels so…”\n “Feels so what?” he managed.\n “Hot. I’m there already.” Her nails dug into his ass. Into his neck. When her cunt pulsed around his shaft buried inside her, he had to grit his teeth to keep still. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/redneck-romeo-rough-riders-15/page-30.html","bookId":2697,"book":{"id":2697,"title":"Redneck Romeo (Rough Riders #15)","description":"Storyline: \n Redneck Romeo (Rough Riders #15) \n The last McKay standing is knocked to his knees… \n Three years ago, Dalton McKay looked across the altar and saw the woman he knew he’d love for the rest of his life…only it wasn’t his bride.
