Time’s a wastin’ to get wasted!” Kyler looked back at Dalton and Rory and grinned. “Hey, someone’s gotta teach me how to be a wild McKay now that the last single man’s been married off.” They watched as he climbed in the driver’s seat. At the top of the hill he spun the tires and threw mud everywhere as Sierra loudly egged him on. “You know, this is really starting to seem like an episode of My Big Fat Redneck Wedding,” Rory said. Dalton laughed. “Then I guess that makes me…your Redneck Romeo, huh, jungle girl?” He swooped her into his arms and carried her to the four-wheeler, the happiest man in the world.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/redneck-romeo-rough-riders-15/page-70.html","bookId":2697,"book":{"id":2697,"title":"Redneck Romeo (Rough Riders #15)","description":"Storyline: Redneck Romeo (Rough Riders #15) The last McKay standing is knocked to his knees… Three years ago, Dalton McKay looked across the altar and saw the woman he knew he’d love for the rest of his life…only it wasn’t his bride. That’s when he took the McKays’ love-’em-and-leave-’em reputation to new heights—fleeing the ceremony and Wyoming. Now a family issue has brought Dalton back to Sundance, giving him a chance to prove to everyone—especially the woman he thought he lost—that he’s a changed man. Aurora “Rory” Wetzler has fallen for cowboy hottie Dalton’s smooth-talkin’ ways too many times. So he’s determined to convince her he’s playing for keeps this go around? Fine. She’ll call that bluff—she can’t ignore their intense chemistry or resist smokin’ hot sex, but she’s not willing to gamble her heart again. Dalton has plenty of fences to mend with the McKays, but his biggest fear is that Rory doesn’t believe they have a future. He’ll have to pull out all the stops to show her they belong together for the long haul. Warning: Contains a sexy cowboy who tames his sassy lady love with his romantic and his kinky side.
