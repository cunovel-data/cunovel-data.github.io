{"id":6170,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 7 Bad News","content":"Wilbur liked Charlotte better and better each day. Her campaign against insects seemed sensible and useful. Hardly anybody around the farm had a good word to say for a fly. Flies spent their time pestering others. The cows hated them. The horses detested them. The sheep loathed them. Mr. and Mrs. Zukerman were always complaining about them, and putting up screens.\n 　　Wilbur admired the way Charlotte managed. He was particularly glad that she always put her victim to sleep before eating it.\n 　　\"It\u0027s real thoughtful of you to do that, Charlotte,\" he said.\n 　　\"Yes,\" she replied in her sweet, musical voice, \"I always give them an anaesthetic so they won\u0027t feel pain. It\u0027s a little service I throw in.\"As the days went by, Wilbur grew and grew. He ate three big meals a day. He spent long hours lying on his side, half asleep, dreaming pleasant dreams. He enjoyed good health and he gained a lot of weight. One afternoon, when Fern was sitting on her stool, the oldest sheep walked into the barn, and stopped to pay a call on Wilbur.\n 　　\"Hello!\" she said. \"Seems to me you\u0027re putting on weight.\"\"Yes, I guess I am,\" replied Wilbur. \"At my age it\u0027s a good idea to keep gaining.\"\"Just the same, I don\u0027t envy you,\" said the old sheep.\" You know why they\u0027re fattening you up, don\u0027t you?\"\"No,\" said Wilbur.\n 　　\"Well, I don\u0027t like to spread bad news,\" said the sheep, \"but they\u0027re fattening you up because they\u0027re going to kill you, that\u0027s why.\"\"They\u0027re going to what?\" screamed Wilbur. Fern grew rigid on her stool.\n 　　\"Kill you. Turn you into smoked bacon and ham,\" continued the old sheep. \"Almost all young pigs get murdered by the farmer as soon as the real cold weather sets in. There\u0027s regular conspiracy around here to kill you at Christmastime. Everybody is in the plog--Lurvy, Zuckerman, even John Arable.\"\"Mr. Arable?\" sobbed Wilbur. \"Fern\u0027s father?\"\"Certainly. When a pig is to be butchered, everybody helps. I\u0027m an old sheep and I see the same thing, same old business, year after year. Arable arrives with hi .22, shoots the...\"\"Stop!\" screamed Wilbur. \"I don\u0027t want to die! Save me, somebody! Save me!\" Fern was just about to jump up when a voice was heard.\n 　　\"Be quiet, Wilbur!\" said Charlotte, who had been listening to this awful conversation.\n 　　\"I can\u0027t be quiet,\" screamed Wilbur, racing up and down. \"I don\u0027t want to be killed. I don\u0027t want to die. Is it true what the old sheep says, Charlotte? Is it true they are going to kill me when the cold weather comes?\"\"Well,\" said the spider, plucking thoughtfully at her web, \"the old sheep has been around this barn a long time. She has seen many a spring pig come and go. If she says they plan to kill you, I\u0027m sure it\u0027s true. It\u0027s also the dirtiest trick I ever heard of. What people don\u0027t think of!\"Wilbur burst into tears. \"I don\u0027t want to die,\" he moaned. \"I want to stay alive, right here in my comfortable manure pile with all my friends. I want to breathe the beautiful air and lie in the beautiful sun.\"\"You\u0027re certainly making a beautiful noise,\" snapped the old sheep.\n 　　\"I don\u0027t want to die!\" screamed Wilbur, throwing himself to the ground.\n 　　\"You shall not die,\" said Charlotte, briskly.\n 　　\"What? Really?\" cried Wilbur. \"Who\u0027s going to save me?\"\"I am,\" said Charlotte.\n 　　\"How?\" asked Wilbur.\n 　　\"That remains to be seen. But I am going to save you, and I want you to quiet down immediately. You\u0027re carrying on in a childish way. Stop your crying! I can\u0027t stand hysterics.\"\n \n 　　威伯一天比一天更喜欢夏洛了。她对昆虫发动的战争似乎是英明的，有益处的。农场周围几乎没人为苍蝇说一句好话，因为苍蝇把他们的所有时间都用来骚扰别人了。母牛恨他们。马憎恶他们。绵羊讨厌他们。祖克曼先生和太太也总是抱怨他们，所以特意装上了纱窗。\n 　　威伯也欣赏夏洛的行事方法。他很高兴她能在吃她的受害者之前先把他们弄睡。\n 　　“你那么做可真体贴，夏洛，”他说。\n 　　“是的，”她用甜甜的嗓音回答，“我总是先麻醉他们，这样他们就不会感到疼了。这是我的一项小小的免费服务。”\n 　　很多天过去了，威伯长了又长。他一天要吃三头猪的饭量了。他把时间都花在躺着，小睡，做美梦上了。他的身体非常健康，体重也增长了许多。一天下午，当芬正在她的凳子上坐着时，那只老羊走到谷仓来拜访威伯。\n 　　“你好！”她说。“我看你好像正在变胖。”\n 　　“是的，我想是，”威伯回答。“在我这个年纪胖起来是好事儿。”\n 　　“虽然如此，可我却不嫉妒你，”老羊说。“你知道他们为什么要把你养这么胖吗？”\n 　　“不知道，”威伯说。\n 　　“呃，我不喜欢传播坏消息，”老羊说，“但我还是要告诉你，他们喂胖你，其实是为了将来杀你，这就是原因。”\n 　　“他们将来要做什么？”威伯尖叫。坐在凳子上的芬也听呆了。\n 　　“杀死你。把你做成腌肉和火腿。”老羊继续说。“几乎所有年青的小猪到了冬天来的时候都会被农场主谋杀。这里有个尽人皆知的阴谋，就是你将在圣诞节被杀掉。每个人都在参与这个计划——鲁维，祖克曼甚至约翰·阿拉贝尔。”\n 　　“阿拉贝尔先生？”威伯啜泣起来。“芬的爸爸？”\n 　　“当然了。宰一头猪时，每人都要来帮忙的。我是一只老羊，这样的事儿见得多了，每一年都是这老一套。阿拉贝尔会带着他的0.22口径的枪，来射向……”\n 　　“别说了！”威伯尖叫。“我不想死！救我，来人哪！救我呀！”这尖叫几乎把芬吓得跳起来。\n 　　“镇静，威伯！”一直听着这段恐怖对话的夏洛说。\n 　　“ 我不能镇静，”威伯大嚷着跑来跑去。“我不想被杀死。我不想死。老羊说的是真的吗，夏洛？冬天来时他们真会杀我吗？”\n 　　“唔，”夏洛说着，轻轻地拉了拉她的网，“老羊已经在这谷仓住很久了。她看过很多来去的春猪。如果她说人们打算杀你，我想那就是真的。这也是我听过的最可耻的诡计。人类有什么想不出来！”\n 　　威伯号啕大哭起来。“我不想死，”他呻吟。“我想在这里活着，就呆在我舒服的牛粪堆旁，和我所有的朋友在一起。我想呼吸甜美的空气，躺在美丽的太阳底下。”\n 　　“你说的全是美丽的胡话。”老羊迅速地打断了他的话。\n 　　“我不想死！”威伯尖叫着，瘫到地上。\n 　　“你不会死的，”夏洛轻快地说。\n 　　“什么？真的吗？”威伯叫。“谁会来救我呢？”\n 　　“我，”夏洛说。\n 　　“怎么救？”威伯问。\n 　　“办法以后会有的。但是在我正考虑怎么救你的时候，我希望你立刻安静下来。你哭叫的样子简直像个小孩子。不要哭！我不能忍受歇斯底里。”\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/283/323.html","bookId":197,"book":{"id":197,"title":"夏洛的网 Charlotte\u0027s Web","description":"简介： Charlotte\u0027s Web is an award-winning children\u0027s novel by acclaimed American author E.
