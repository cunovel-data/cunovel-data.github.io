{"id":109126,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"Dread assaulted me as soon as I opened my eyes.\n There had been no nightmares, no visions, nothing in my dreams to indicate Kanin was still alive. I woke, slumped against the wall in the dank little cell, and instantly looked to the corner where his dark, hunched form had been the night before.\n It was empty.\n \"Don\u0027t panic, Allison,\" soothed a low, quiet voice, stopping me from doing just that. I jerked my gaze to the door... and there he was, standing beside the frame, watching me. \"I\u0027m right here.\"\n Relief, swift and sudden, coursed through me. I leaped upright and hurried toward him, studying his face as I drew close. The black wounds were still there, but they were smaller now, less severe. I could see pink flesh around the edges, where new skin was forming, beginning to regrow, to heal.\n \"It worked!\" I whispered. Kanin gave me a small smile. \"It appears I am going to live awhile longer.\"\n \"Allie.\" Zeke appeared in the doorway, glanced at Kanin, back at me, and grinned. \"Hey, vampire girl,\" he said, walking up to me, and I collapsed against him in relief. \"You did it.\"\n Kanin watched us, his dark eyes lingering on Zeke, appraising. \"I believe,\" he murmured, sounding hopeful and awed himself, \"that we have found our cure.\"\n We drew two more vials of Zeke\u0027s blood, injecting me with one and giving the other to Kanin, just in case something happened to us on the way back. Zeke offered more, but I didn\u0027t want to take too much and weaken him for the trip back, especially after he\u0027d just recovered from Sarren\u0027s virus. Jackal complained when he didn\u0027t get one, and I told him that the only way he would get any of Zeke\u0027s blood was over my dead body. Shockingly, he didn\u0027t follow up with the obvious threat, and we made our way back to the foyer and the elevator shaft. Back topside and to the Fringe. Back to the Prince.\n \"Don\u0027t tell Salazar how we got the cure,\" Kanin warned us as we all converged aboveground again. The snow had stopped, and overhead the moon was a huge silver disk in the sky. \"If he asks, we found the blood in the lab. If he discovers the source of the cure, Ezekiel will never be allowed to leave the city. Is that clear?\"\n He looked at Jackal as he said this, but I felt cold at the thought of Zeke being taken away, down to the vampire hospital, where they\u0027d probably drain every drop of blood from his veins. Or keep him imprisoned forever, in case there was another outbreak.\n \"Don\u0027t have to glare at me, old man,\" Jackal said. \"I wouldn\u0027t allow anything to happen to our dear Ezekiel now.\"\n He sounded serious, which made me very nervous in turn. I could tell Zeke didn\u0027t like it, either, but he didn\u0027t say anything as we followed Kanin across the trampled field, being careful to step only where he stepped. Was it because Jackal had started to respect Zeke as a human and an individual? I nearly snorted out loud at the thought. Or, as I suspected, was it because Zeke\u0027s blood was one step closer to the larger cure we all sought? The end to Rabidism?\n We had one more run-in with bleeders, a small group on the outskirts between sectors, before we could drop into the Undercity. I tried not to kill them, knowing that, if we could just get to Salazar in time, they might be saved. But it was hard, since they ignored pain and refused to stay down, and I ended up cutting through several in self-defense. I wanted to help, but I wasn\u0027t going to die for them.\n Finally, hours later, Kanin led us up a ladder, pushed back a manhole cover, and the gleaming trio of vampire towers rose before us into the sky. We walked down the center of the road until we met a patrol, who immediately took us into the tower, up the elevator-I still hated it-and to the Prince.\n Salazar met us in a different office this time, probably because his old one was still demolished. As we walked up to the doors, they opened, and Stick emerged with his everpresent bodyguards. His eyes went wide as he saw us, mouth dropping open, before his face darkened and he gave me a look of pure loathing. I held his gaze as we passed, wondering if he would try to stop us, to give me an excuse to drive a fist into his sullen mouth once and for all. But he stepped aside, though I felt his glare on my back even after the door had closed.\n Kanin swept into the office without preamble or explanation, the rest of us trailing behind. The Prince of New Covington stood at the back window, gazing out at the city when we came in, and turned as Kanin approached, raising an eyebrow. Kanin stopped, and something glinted in the dim light as it arced toward the Prince, who caught it easily.\n \"There\u0027s your cure,\" Kanin said as Salazar glanced at the syringe in his hand, brows drawing together. \"I trust you have ways to synthesize it for the rest of the population.\"\n The Prince looked up at Kanin, his gaze searching. I saw him putting the pieces together. Kanin, terminally sick when we left the Inner City. Who should be dead by now, or at least, a rotted corpse. \"And you are certain this will work on both human and vampire?\" he asked.\n \"Yes,\" Kanin said without hesitation.\n \"And Sar ren?\"\n \"Gone.\" Kanin didn\u0027t give any explanation. \"The old hospital in Sector Two is where he made his lair, and the virus. If you care to search it, that is. Now...\" He narrowed his gaze, staring the Prince down. \"We\u0027ve done what you asked, and found a cure for your city. Will you honor your end of the bargain and let us go?\"\n Salazar didn\u0027t answer right away. Walking to his desk, he scribbled a quick note on a piece of paper, then pressed a buzzer on the surface of the wood. A few moments later a guard entered the room and hurried to his side.\n \"Take this to Dr. Emerson in the subhospital,\" Salazar said, handing the note and the syringe full of blood to the guard. \"Tell him it is vitally important that he start work on this right away. That it takes precedence over every one of his other projects. And if that somehow becomes lost between this office and the basement, you will spend the rest of your short life wishing you were never born.\"\n The guard paled. Clutching the syringe and the note in a death grip, he jerked a hasty bow and immediately left the room. Salazar watched the door click behind him, and turned back to us.\n \"Kanin.\" The look the Prince gave the other Master was not friendly. \"This will not atone for your crimes. Nothing you do will ever erase what you have caused. I should kill you where you stand, and make your offspring watch, so that she will fully appreciate the depth of your treachery.\"\n I tensed, my hand itching to draw my weapon. Kanin didn\u0027t move, so I forced myself to relax. But if Salazar decided to double-cross us again, I hoped he was prepared for a fight. I was certainly not going to stand there and watch Kanin be killed in front of me. What Sarren did to Salazar\u0027s last office would be nothing compared to what I would do to this one.\n The Prince and Kanin stared at each other for another long, brittle moment, before Salazar turned away with a sigh. \"However,\" he said, as though the very word was poison to him, \"I am a man of my word, and you have done what I have requested. Therefore, I will honor my agreement. You are free to go...as soon as I am certain the cure will work.\"\n \"And when will that be?\" Kanin asked softly.\n \"Soon.\" The Prince made a vague gesture. \"Tomorrow night, if we are lucky. Until then, you will remain here as my guests. If you need anything, my pets will attend you. Now, if you\u0027ll excuse me.\" The Prince turned his back on us in blatant dismissal, walking to the window again. \"I have a city to put back together.\"\n \"Well,\" I ventured as we left Salazar\u0027s office, stepping back into the long hallway. I glanced over at Kanin, Zeke and Jackal, and shrugged. \"What now?\"\n Jackal rolled his eyes and stepped away from us. \"What now is that I am going to relax for a few hours without listening to the lot of you whine at me. \u0027Ohhh, don\u0027t hurt the humans, ohhh, we have to save refugees from mole men, ohhh, Kanin is dying.\u0027 Ugh.\" He made a disgusted gesture with both hands. \"It\u0027s enough to make me puke. I am going to the bar to get this taste out of my mouth. You all can do whatever you want.\"\n And with that, the former raider king spun on a heel and marched off down the hall. Kanin watched him leave and shook his head.\n \"Kanin? What about you?\"\n My sire gave me a tired smile. \"I will be in my room, taking advantage of the Prince\u0027s hospitality, behind a locked door.\"\n \"Avoiding the other vampires, you mean.\"\n \"Precisely. And I would encourage the both of you to do the same. The Prince might have granted us amnesty, but the other vampires will not look kindly on your association with me. It is best that we lie low until we can leave New Covington for good.\"\n Leave New Covington. Where would we go now? I wondered as the three of us wandered back down to the guest floor. I hadn\u0027t really thought about it until now. Before, my whole focus had been on finding Kanin, and then the whole mess with Sarren. Now that I\u0027d found him, where did we go from here?\n \"Ezekiel,\" Kanin said, surprising me. We\u0027d stopped in front of a door much like the one to my guest suite; this room was either Kanin\u0027s or Zeke\u0027s, I guessed. Zeke glanced back at the vampire, questioning, and Kanin lowered his voice.\n \"May I speak with you a moment? Alone?\"\n Zeke blinked, frowning a bit. \"Uh, sure. Allie?\" He looked at me. \"Do you mind?\"\n Stung, I glanced at Kanin. Why would he want to talk to Zeke and not me? Wasn\u0027t I his \"offspring\"? Wasn\u0027t I the one who\u0027d come all this way to find him? \"Why?\" I challenged. \"Are you two going to talk about me, is that it?\"\n \"Allison.\" Kanin had reverted to his annoyed-mentor voice, which only made me bristle.\n \"Fine.\" I stepped back, glaring at them both. Hurt and irritation made me want to stubbornly stay put, but I knew it was useless with Kanin. \"You two have fun with your boy talk. I\u0027ll be in my room.\"\n \"Allie,\" Zeke said, but I turned and walked down the hall, and didn\u0027t stop until I\u0027d reached my door.\n Inside the suite, a middle-aged human woman was stocking the fridge with fresh blood bags from a cooler. She jerked up when I came in. \"Oh, excuse me, ma\u0027am!\" she exclaimed, grabbing the cooler and hurrying out of the kitchen. \"I\u0027ve restocked your fridge, per the Prince\u0027s orders, and if you leave any dirty clothes on the floor, I\u0027ll be sure to wash and return them before tomorrow evening. There are extra outfits in the closet and the dresser by the bed.\"\n \"Um...thank you,\" I replied warily, and she bobbed as she backed toward the exit, keeping her gaze on the floor. More perks of living in a vampire tower, I supposed. I bet it was pretty easy to get used to this, if you didn\u0027t mind keeping slaves and ruling through fear. And that your hired help got eaten once in a while.\n \"Oh, and Mr. Stephen said to make sure you got your book,\" the human said in the door frame, making me jerk around, narrowing my eyes. She pointed to the nightstand by the bed. \"He said to tell you not to forget it.\"\n I strode to the nightstand, ignoring the human as she quickly shut the door. My mom\u0027s book sat beneath the lamp, the simple children\u0027s story she\u0027d read to me countless times. Why would Stick leave it here? He hated me. I saw a slip of paper sticking out of the top and pulled it out, recognizing Stick\u0027s thin, loopy handwriting immediately.\n Allie,\n This is yours. I was going to burn it, but I want you to have it instead, because if it wasn\u0027t for you, I wouldn\u0027t be here now.\n -Stephen\n I crumpled the note in my fist, tossing it to the floor. I knew Stick well enough to know that he hadn\u0027t left this here to be nice or to apologize for the way things had turned out. It was just another jab in this stupid, imaginary war he thought we were in. He was able to become the Prince\u0027s aide because he could read. Because I had taught him.\n Whatever. I wasn\u0027t going to let him ruin the memory of my mom. And I would be gone from this place soon enough, never to see him again. Shrugging off my coat, I folded it and placed it and the book on the dresser so I wouldn\u0027t forget them. Stripping out of my torn, dirty shirt and jeans, I headed into the bathroom.\n After a long shower, I left my filthy clothes in a heap on the floor, changed into the dark pants and shirt in the closet- did every vampire in this place wear black?-and poured a bag of cold blood into a mug on the counter. There was probably a way the city vamps warmed up their blood-surely the Prince didn\u0027t drink it cold every night-but I had no idea how they did it, so I forced it down as it was. I wasn\u0027t worried about it being poisoned this time. With Zeke\u0027s blood, I was effectively vaccinated against Sarren\u0027s plague.\n I sobered a little, thinking of Zeke. What were he and Kanin discussing? Why the big secret? There had to be a reason Kanin didn\u0027t want me to hear what they were talking about. Maybe it was about me. Maybe he was trying to convince Zeke of the foolishness of being with a vampire, since he\u0027d written me off as a stubborn lost cause who didn\u0027t listen or follow his rules.\n Dammit, now I had to know. There was no reason either of them should be talking about something without me, not after everything we\u0027d been through. Unless it was about me, of course, which made me even more determined to find out what they were saying. Kanin wouldn\u0027t tell me, but I\u0027d bet I could get Zeke to talk. And if he and Kanin were still in the room, they would just have to let me in on the secret, because I wasn\u0027t leaving until they did.\n There were still a few hours till dawn. Finishing the last of the cold blood, I rose, grabbed my katana from where it lay on a chair and went looking for Zeke.\n The hallways were empty of vampires as I made my way to the room where I\u0027d left them. A couple humans scurried around, carrying mops and cleaning supplies. I didn\u0027t see anyone else until I neared the room and a furtive movement caught my attention.\n It was Stick, without his guards for once. He hovered in the shadows, trying to be inconspicuous, looking like he couldn\u0027t decide whether he wanted to walk up and knock on the door.\n My suspicion flared. I stalked forward with a growl, but Stick spotted me, went pale and fled down the corridor. Sprinting around a corner, he vanished from sight. I considered going after him, forcing him to talk, but he\u0027d probably run straight to the Prince or his guards, and it wasn\u0027t worth the hassle.\n Instead, I went to the door and knocked firmly on the wood, listening for familiar voices. If they were still talking, too bad. I wasn\u0027t leaving. They would just have to tell me what was going on.\n But when Zeke opened the door a few seconds later, there was no sign of Kanin in the room beyond. For a moment, I was disappointed-I wanted to know what they were talking about.\n But then, I realized it was just me and Zeke. Alone. And suddenly, I was glad Kanin wasn\u0027t around.\n \"Allie.\" Zeke seemed surprised to see me, though not unhappy about it. He had showered, too, judging from his damp blond hair and clean clothes. He looked good in black, I thought, noting the way his shirt clung to his chest and biceps. The vest had concealed how muscular he really was. \"I didn\u0027t expect to see you again tonight,\" he continued, stepping back to let me in. \"Is something wrong?\"\n I shook my head, moving past him into the room. It was much like mine: a single bed, a bathroom, a small kitchenette. A plate sat on a small round table, the remains of real food scattered around it, vegetables, bread, the skin of a potato. I was amazed. Salazar\u0027s luxuries extended even to our sole human.\n \"No, nothing\u0027s wrong,\" I told him, turning back. \"I...just had a question, that\u0027s all.\"\n Zeke smiled. \"Let me guess.\" He shut and locked the door behind us, then turned back with a half amused, half resigned look. \"You want to know what Kanin and I were talking about earlier, without you.\"\n I shrugged. \"Well?\" I asked, not bothering to deny it. \"What were you talking about?\"\n Zeke walked across the floor, coming to stand just a few feet away. \"And, what would you do if I said I couldn\u0027t tell you right now?\"\n \"That\u0027s easy.\" I grinned at him, setting my katana sheath on the table. \"I\u0027ll just have to beat it out of you.\"\n His eyebrows arched, and a challenging gleam entered his eyes. \"Is that so, vampire girl?\" he asked, smiling and crossing his arms. \"I\u0027d like to see you try.\"\n \"Okay, but you asked for it.\"\n I lunged. He caught me around the waist as I crashed into him, wrapped my arms around his neck and kissed him fiercely. No barriers anymore, no doubts, no Kanin or Jackal nearby, watching and judging. It was just us, alone, both knowing what we wanted. I slid my hands into his damp hair, pressing myself to him, and he hugged me close, his lips warm on mine. I felt the hard muscles through his shirt as we locked ourselves together, the beat of his heart against my chest. The Hunger roared up, even though it had been fed just minutes before, a now-familiar ache.\n His scent and warmth surrounded me, heady and intoxicating. Unable to stop myself, my fangs lengthened, sliding out of my gum, as he bent to kiss my neck, murmuring my name. I wanted him. I wanted to feel that rush of heat and life flowing through my veins. I wanted to taste him again, drink in that essence, stifle the monster raging inside.\n Dropping my head, I pressed my lips to the hollow at Zeke\u0027s throat, feeling heat and pulse and life beat there, right below the skin. So close. All I\u0027d have to do was part my lips just slightly, bite down just a little, and that warmth would fill me again.\n Zeke\u0027s arms tightened around my waist, and a shiver went through him. But before I could draw away, before I could feel horrified with myself, he very deliberately tilted his head back, baring his throat. And my world froze.\n He would let me, I realized. Zeke would let me bite him, feed from him. Even now, with my fangs so close to his neck, my lips at his throat, he was calm. Waiting. My eyes stung with the understanding. He had truly accepted what being with a vampire meant. Everything.\n My fangs slid back, retracting once more, and I gently kissed the pulse at his neck...before reaching up and bringing his face down to mine again. I could feel his surprise as our lips touched. He had been expecting me to bite him, bracing for it. But, as I was slowly discovering, I could be more human around Zeke. He somehow reached that tiny sliver of humanity buried within the monster, and it had reached out for him, as well.\n We kissed for several intense minutes, until Zeke drew back, his gaze fervent. I watched him, loving the rings of silver around his pupils when he was this close, the way his hair fell over his forehead. \"Come with me to Eden,\" he whispered, never taking his eyes from my face. I gave him an exasperated smile.\n \"You\u0027re going to keep asking me until I say yes, aren\u0027t you?\"\n \"Please,\" Zeke added quietly, holding me tighter. \"Say yes. Kanin and I already talked about it-he\u0027s going, as well. That\u0027s what we were discussing earlier. He just didn\u0027t want his decision to affect yours in any way. But you\u0027re coming too, right?\" His hand slipped into my hair, running it through his fingers. \"I can\u0027t... I won\u0027t go without you, Allie. Please. Come to Eden with us.\"\n \"All right.\" I sighed, admitting defeat. \"Yes. Of course I\u0027m coming to Eden. Was there really any doubt with both you and Kanin going?\" I shook my head at him, smirking. \"So, yes, Ezekiel. I will come to Eden with you, and hopefully your scientists won\u0027t throw me in a cage and stick me full of tubes.\"\n Zeke pressed his lips to mine, quick and sweet. \"They won\u0027t,\" he said as he drew back. \"I promise. They already know about you, what you did for me and the others. And Kanin...\" He shrugged. \"I see now what you meant about him. He\u0027s not like the other vampires, either.\" His expression grew teasing. \"I can see where you get it from.\"\n \"Don\u0027t make me bite you, preacher boy.\" I frowned then, remembering something. \"Wait, what about Jackal?\"\n \"Jackal.\" His eyes went solemn. \"That was another reason Kanin and I wanted to talk in private. Tomorrow evening, we\u0027re leaving the city, without the Prince\u0027s knowledge. Jackal won\u0027t be coming with us.\"\n \"We\u0027re leaving him behind?\"\n \"More like Kanin will make it clear that Jackal is no longer welcome to travel with us,\" Zeke said. \"And that if he follows us or tracks us down, he\u0027ll kill him.\"\n I blinked. \"That\u0027s a little extreme.\"\n \"I\u0027m not bringing him to Eden, Allie.\" Zeke\u0027s voice was grave. \"Can you imagine someone like Jackal around Caleb? Or Bethany?\"\n I made a face. \"Right. I can see your point.\"\n \"I\u0027m taking a huge risk by bringing you and Kanin back,\" Zeke admitted. \"Letting even a single vampire through the gates is one thing, but two?\" He shook his head. \"If I brought in Jackal, and he hurt someone, I could never forgive myself. Plus, the Eden officials would never trust any vampire again. They\u0027d kill you, and Kanin, and probably me. Jackal could put us all at risk. He has to stay away.\"\n \"And if he ignores the warning and tracks us down using our blood tie?\"\n \"Then I\u0027ll get the chance to make good on my promise,\" Zeke said darkly, his eyes going cold for a moment. \"But I think Jackal will be smart enough to stay away from us, especially if Kanin warns him to.\"\n I nodded. I didn\u0027t really like it, and Jackal wouldn\u0027t like it, but we certainly couldn\u0027t take him with us. Zeke was right. The raider king was far too volatile to trust in Eden, especially since the cure would be right there. Knowing him, he\u0027d grab it and run as soon as he got the opportunity. \"So.\" I looped my arms around his neck, feeling mischievous and strangely wicked. \"When are we putting this daring plan into action?\"\n \"Just after sundown.\" His eyes half closed as I leaned in and brushed my lips across his jaw. \"We\u0027ll come get you. Be ready to move fast.\"\n \"I can do that.\" I smiled at him lazily. \"Or, I could just stay here tonight.\"\n Zeke\u0027s breathing hitched. \"Allie,\" he said, sounding breathless. His heart pounded as if he\u0027d run several miles, fast and frantic. \"I...I want you to. But...I want this to be right for us.\" His palm cupped my cheek, warm and smooth, stroking with his thumb. \"We just found each other again. I don\u0027t want to do anything we\u0027ll regret later. If you stay, I don\u0027t think I could... I mean...\" He sighed, squeezing his eyes shut. \"You have no idea how hard this is for me, but...maybe, this isn\u0027t the right time. Not now, in a vampire tower...with them all around.\" He opened his eyes, giving me a pleading look. \"Do you understand...what I\u0027m trying to say?\"\n I smiled. \"You\u0027re turning red, did you know that?\"\n \"Allie!\" Zeke blew out his breath in a huff. I laughed, released him and stepped back.\n \"All right,\" I said, picking up my katana sheath. \"I\u0027ll go back to my room then, preacher boy.\" He looked both relieved and disappointed, but oddly enough, I wasn\u0027t upset. Kanin was alive. Zeke was alive. We, against all hope, had found a cure for New Covington. Tomorrow, the three of us would leave the city to go to Eden. Zeke and I had time. He wasn\u0027t going anywhere, and neither was I.\n He followed me to the door, pausing as I unlocked it and stepped into the hall. \"Good night, Zeke.\" But as I started to leave, he reached out and took my wrist, stopping me.\n \"Allison, wait.\"\n I turned. Zeke stood there, holding my hand, a conflicted look on his face, as if he was trying to find the right words. My skin prickled, blood singing, as he raised his eyes to mine. \"I... What I\u0027m trying to say is...\"\n A movement off to the side made him turn his head. I glanced in that direction and saw Stick once more, watching us from around a corner, his eyes dark.\n Zeke faltered, then let me go, drawing back through the frame. \"Never mind,\" he said, smiling to ease the embarrassment. And even though I was furious with Stick for his damned interruption, my skin prickled under that look. \"It\u0027s not important. Well, it is, but...I\u0027ll tell you later. When we\u0027re out of New Covington. I promise.\"\n When his door closed, I thought of going to find Kanin, just to confirm the plan. But then I thought I might run into Jackal, Stick or the Prince, all of whom I didn\u0027t want to see right then. So I wandered back to my room, flipped through my mom\u0027s book for a while and replayed my conversation with Zeke until I had it memorized. I almost went back to his room several times, despite what he\u0027d said, until dawn threatened the horizon and the decision was made for me.\n But something still nagged at my brain as I crawled atop the sheets of the huge bed, drawing the curtains against the light. Something dark and ominous, making it hard to relax, even in a place like this.\n It hit me, then. Sarren. Sarren was still out there, somewhere in the dark. Where was he now? I wondered, lying back against the sheets. Had he left New Covington? Or was he still hanging around, waiting for us, eager for revenge?\n The thought was troubling, but I put it from my mind as sleep began to draw me under. Even if Sarren was still in the city, he couldn\u0027t get into the Prince\u0027s tower, not without alerting every human and vampire in the place. This was the most secure place in all New Covington. Not even Sarren could take on an entire army. As long as we stayed in the tower, we were safe from crazy vampires and their plans for revenge. And between me, Zeke and Kanin, Sarren would have his work cut out for him if we faced him together.\n Let him try something, I thought as my eyes closed and I slipped further into the darkness. I had already taken his eye, his arm, and Kanin and Zeke were alive and well. I wasn\u0027t afraid of him anymore.\n I awoke the next night right at sundown, changed into my old clothes-which had been washed and laid out for me as promised-and waited for Kanin and Zeke.\n After several minutes, my uneasiness grew. They weren\u0027t here yet. Where were they? Had the Prince reneged on his promise, and Kanin was down in the dungeon again, being tortured and starved? Had Jackal discovered the plan to leave him behind and decided to take matters into his own hands? I tried not to fidget, to imagine the worst possible outcomes, but as the minutes ticked by, my apprehension and anger grew more and more.\n \"Screw it,\" I finally muttered after nearly a half hour had passed and neither of them had showed. \"I\u0027m not waiting around here. I\u0027ll find them myself.\"\n Making sure I had everything-my sword and my mom\u0027s book-I stalked across the room, threw the door open and nearly ran into Kanin on the other side.\n \"Dammit, Kanin!\" I staggered back, glaring at him. \"Where were you? I was just about to go looking for...\"\n I trailed off at the look on his face. \"Come with me,\" he said in a low, strained voice, and immediately started walking away. I scrambled to catch up.\n \"Kanin? Where are we going? What\u0027s going on?\" I frowned up at him. \"Where\u0027s Zeke, and Jackal?\" He didn\u0027t answer, and I jogged to keep pace with him. \"Hey, you\u0027re kind of scaring me.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Kanin almost whispered, and a cold fist grabbed my insides. \"I can\u0027t say more, Allison. You\u0027ll see when we get there.\"\n Numb with terror, I followed him into the elevators, watching the numbers descend, one by one, until we hit the basement.\n Prince Salazar glared at me as we entered the hospital, his dark eyes glittering with anger. Not for Kanin this time. Me. I ignored the Prince, though, when I saw Jackal, Dr. Emerson and several guards surrounding a single cot in the middle of the room. A body lay atop it, lean and tall, though I couldn\u0027t see it clearly through the crowd. The sheets beneath it were soaked in blood, and my mind started screaming a protest.\n No! No, it can\u0027t be him! Dammit, it cannot be him!\n \"He was found outside the towers, early this morning,\" Salazar said, his voice tight with bridled rage. \"We brought him in, but there is nothing more to be done. It is a miracle he has survived this long. He has been asking for you, Kanin\u0027s daughter.\"\n No, I moaned silently, incapable of speech right then. But Salazar stepped aside, as did Emerson and the guards, and I saw who lay atop the bed.\n Stick\u0027s glassy, pain-filled eyes met mine across the room, and widened when they saw me. \"Allie?\" he whispered, and my relief that it wasn\u0027t Zeke quickly turned to horror as I studied him. Blood soaked his middle, stained through his business suit, and his skin was the color of chalk. His expression was filled with pain and fear, and all the bitterness, rage and hurt toward him melted away as he held out a pale, blood-spattered hand. \"Allie...\"\n I took it, stepping to his side. \"What happened?\" I whispered, looking over his wounds in despair. I\u0027d seen this before. Stabbed through the gut, a wound that was painful and lingering. He didn\u0027t have long. \"Who did this to you?\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Stick whispered, his voice choked. \"I\u0027m sorry, Allie. I didn\u0027t know. I\u0027m sorry.\"\n \"Sorry for what?\" I murmured as he shuddered and began coughing. Blood ran from his mouth, streaming down his neck, and I glared over the cot at Salazar. \"Do something!\" I snapped at the Prince. \"You have a doctor here! Don\u0027t just stand there and watch!\"\n The Prince\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"I do not make a habit of aiding those who betray me,\" he said, and I stared at him in utter confusion.\n \"What? Betrayed you? How?\"\n \"Allie,\" Stick whispered again, clutching at my arm. \"S-Sarren,\" he gasped. \"It was Sarren. He came back.\"\n My blood turned to ice. \"Sarren did this to you? How? When?\"\n \"I...led him there,\" Stick went on. \"I led him to Sarren. He was waiting for us. Promised to...take him away. Didn\u0027t know...he would stab me. I\u0027m...so sorry, Allie.\"\n Took him away? \"Who?\" I whispered, but Stick gasped and his hand dropped from my arm, his eyes rolling back. \"Stick!\" I growled, grasping him by the collar, my entire insides twisting like sharpened wire. \"Who? Who did Sarren take? Who did you lead outside? Who?\"\n \"Zeke,\" Stick whispered, and my world shattered around me. \"It was Zeke. Sarren...has him now.\"\n \"Son of a bitch,\" someone growled behind me, Jackal perhaps, but I wasn\u0027t thinking straight anymore. I stared at this...thing below me, this creature who I thought had been human, once.\n \"He said...you would know...where to find them.\" I was barely listening, now. Sarren had Zeke. Zeke had been with him, all night. \"He said...they would be in the place where you left him...in pieces.\"\n The hospital. Sarren would be at the old hospital. And Zeke would be there, as well. Alive. He had to be alive.\n \"I just...wanted to get you to see me,\" the thing continued, pleading. \"I...wanted you to know...that I wasn\u0027t useless. That I...could be strong, like you. I wanted you to see me, that\u0027s all. Just...me.\"\n \"I do.\" Numb, I slid off the bed. \"I see you now.\"\n \"Allie...\"\n \"Go to hell, Stick,\" I whispered, and turned away. He made a choking sound, clutching at my arm, but I ripped it out of his grasp. I kept walking until Kanin stopped me at the door, his face grave, and I glanced over my shoulder. The body had fallen back against the pillows, watery blue eyes gazing sightlessly at the ceiling. One pale hand dangled over the edge.\n I felt nothing. The body didn\u0027t register as a friend, or even an acquaintance. It was a stranger. Turning away, I walked past Kanin and swept through the doors, leaving behind the corpse of someone I used to know. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-eternity-cure-blood-of-eden-2/page-21.html","bookId":2523,"book":{"id":2523,"title":"The Eternity Cure (Blood of Eden #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Eternity Cure (Blood of Eden #2) \n She has done the unthinkable: died so that she might continue to live.
