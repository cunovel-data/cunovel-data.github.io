{"id":109127,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"\"Allison!\" Kanin\u0027s booming voice jerked me to a halt just before I hit the elevator doors. My sire almost never raised his voice, but when he did, it could either knock you over or freeze you in place. I turned, watching him stride up, his face impassive. \"You cannot rush off to confront him alone,\" he said in a low voice, joining me at the elevators. \"If you wait, Jackal and I will come with you.\" \"Wait?\" I snarled, glaring at the numbered lights above the metal doors, cursing them to move faster. \"There\u0027s no time to wait! We have to find them, now! The elevator dinged, and I started forward, but Kanin grabbed both my shoulders, holding me back. \"Listen to me,\" he said, giving me a little shake. \"You need to hear this. Ezekiel has been with Sarren for hours. Alone. He knows where Eden is. He knows the scientists are working on a cure, and Sarren will want that information. Allison...\" Kanin squeezed my shoulders. \"You have to prepare yourself for what we may find. You can\u0027t let it destroy you.\" I shook my head frantically. \"No. No, Zeke will be there. He\u0027ll be all right.\" \"This is Sarren,\" Kanin reminded me, his voice uncharacteristically gentle. \"You saw what he did to me. You know what he\u0027s capable of. Your human is strong. But...he\u0027s only human. And Sarren is the best at what he does.\" His voice softened even more. \"This is our world, Allison. It\u0027s pain and blood and death, and this is the reason I wanted you to keep your distance. To not get attached.\" He let me go and straightened, though his dark eyes still bored into me. \"Whatever we find,\" he said quietly. \"Whatever you see or hear, you must be prepared, because it will be worse than you could ever imagine. Do you understand?\" \"Yes,\" I hissed, hot tears stinging my eyes. Because he was, as always, right. He was right about Sarren, and he was right about his very first rule of vampirism. But it was far too late now. I was attached. And if Zeke was gone, I didn\u0027t know what I would do. \"Well,\" Jackal muttered, finally joining us at the doors. \"I guess saying \u0027I told you so\u0027 is kind of pointless now. I knew I should\u0027ve ripped that skinny bastard\u0027s head off when I had the chance. Back to the Fringe again, huh?\" He groaned and gave me an almost pitying look. \"Fine. Let\u0027s go see if there\u0027s anything left to rescue.\" The hospital grounds were quiet as we slipped across the field: no bleeders, no mobs of infected humans, nothing. It was snowing heavily, and the flakes had covered up all traces of previous passings, ours and Sarren\u0027s. There was no blood, and no sign of a struggle at the entrance to the hospital or in the ruined foyer. I didn\u0027t know if that was a good or bad sign, but I was hopeful. But then, we opened the door to the last room, and that all changed. The scent of Zeke\u0027s blood was everywhere, slamming me in the face as soon as the door swung back. My stomach turned, and my legs nearly gave out, but I forced myself into the room, gazing around in terror. Where was he? Had Sarren locked him in a cell? Strung his body up? Where...? And then, I saw. The table where I had lain the night before, the bed with the straps and thick leather cuffs, sat in the center of the room, a spotlight trained on it. It was covered in blood, as were the tools on the cart beside it, and the floor surrounding it was streaked with red. There was no body. The straps were empty, and the surface was clear, except for a strange flat square in the very center of the bed. Something glimmered in the light, something small and shiny, and vaguely familiar. Numbly, I walked to the table, staring down at what lay in the middle. One of those strange, portable computers from the time before the plague. But it wasn\u0027t the ancient computer that caught my attention, but what lay on top of it. Zeke\u0027s silver cross, covered in blood. I picked it up in a daze, not really acknowledging what it meant. It was his; his scent clung to it, reminding me of him. He\u0027d been wearing it the last time I saw him. He\u0027d been fine, then, just last night. Alive, smiling, kissing me. My hand moved on its own, seeming to belong to someone else, reaching out to push up the lid on the computer. As the screen rose, there was a soft click, and a faint whirring sound from within. \"Hello, little bird,\" came Sarren\u0027s faint, disembodied voice, small and tinny sounding, under the screen. \"The camera on this computer is shot to hell, I\u0027m afraid, so we\u0027ll just have to be content with audio. Pity. I really wanted to show you what I\u0027ve been doing. But, perhaps a song is worth a thousand pictures, hmm? Show her what I mean, Ezekiel. Sing for us.\" And a scream, a horrible, gut-wrenching scream rose from the computer, making me clench my fist so hard Zeke\u0027s cross pierced the skin of my palm. I almost reached out and slammed the lid shut, but I forced myself not to move, to listen to Zeke\u0027s agony, until the scream finally died away and the sound of tortured breathing took its place. \"You should be very proud, little bird.\" Sarren\u0027s voice slithered out of the computer, cruel and soulless. \"He\u0027s held out remarkably well. Better than I ever thought a human capable of. But I suspect he\u0027s reaching his limit. I wanted you to be here for his final moments, to realize just how much you\u0027ve lost. It\u0027s only fair-you did take my arm, after all. A man can get very attached to his arm. Well, shall we get on with it, then?\" There was a faint metallic clink, as if Sarren picked up something small and shiny. \"Ezek iel,\" he crooned, his voice farther away now, moving around the table, \"I have asked you this before, but perhaps now you are more inclined to talk to me, yes? How did you survive the virus? Where did you find a cure?\" \"I...don\u0027t k now.\" I bit my lip so hard I tasted blood. Zeke\u0027s voice was a choked whisper through gritted teeth. The smell of him surrounded me, seeping into my mind, and I saw him strapped to the table, eyes bright with pain, as Sarren loomed over him with something that glittered in the spotlight. \"You don\u0027t know?\" Sarren repeated, his voice mockingly surprised. \"Jackal gave me the impression that you were at death\u0027s door. Are you certain you don\u0027t remember?\" Behind me, Jackal swore. But before I could register what that meant, it was drowned out in the scream of anguish that came through the machine in front of me. I froze, my blood turning to ice, as I waited for it to stop. It didn\u0027t stop. For several long minutes, it ebbed and flowed, sometimes fading to breathless, gasping sobs, sometimes rising to piercing heights of agony. For a second, I was vaguely aware of Kanin standing rigid beside me, eyes closed as if he was remembering his own misery. But after a while, everything shrank down to the soul-destroying noise coming from the computer, the sounds of someone wanting to die. Oh, God, Zeke. Tears streamed down my face; my hands were clenched so hard I could feel blood dripping from my palm. Please, just tell him. Just give him what he wants. Finally, finally, it stopped. And Zeke\u0027s shuddering, gasping breaths were all that could be heard for a few moments. \"Now, Ezekiel,\" Sarren whispered, his voice dangerously calm. \"One last time. Where did you find that cure? And if you lie to me, we can continue this all night. And the next. And the next. I have all the time in the world.\" Zeke took several more ragged, panting breaths, and then, in a voice of utter pain and defeat, whispered, \"Eden. The cure...is in Eden.\" \"Ahhhh,\" Sarren rasped. \"Now we are getting somewhere. So, little prince, we are nearing the finish point at last. One more question, and then I will end your misery, and send you on to your reward. Would you like that? Would you like the hurting to stop?\" Zeke coughed, the sound bloody and painful. \"Just...kill me,\" he whispered in a strangled voice. \"Get it over with already.\" \"Soon, little prince. Soon. One question more.\" Sarren put down the tool with a clink. I could see him bending over Zeke, bringing his face very close as he whispered in a slow, deliberate voice, \"Where is Eden?\" Zeke sucked in a breath, and didn\u0027t make any noise. Sarren waited several heartbeats, then chuckled. \"Oh, Ezekiel. You were doing so well. Don\u0027t stop now.\" Zeke still didn\u0027t say anything, and Sarren\u0027s voice turned ugly and terrifying. \"Three seconds, little human. Before I make you wish you were never born. Before the pain you experienced up until this point will seem like a pleasant, halfremembered dream compared to what I am about to do. Be very certain this is what you want. One.\" \"Allison.\" Kanin\u0027s voice was low, tight. \"Close the laptop. You don\u0027t want to hear this.\" \"Two.\" I started to reach for it, then stopped, shaking my head. \"No,\" I whispered, drawing back, clutching Zeke\u0027s cross tightly. \"I owe it to him, to remember.\" \"Three.\" I braced myself for the worst. It was worse. Far, far worse. This one seemed to last forever, and Zeke\u0027s screams began to falter simply because his throat was too raw to continue. I wanted to close my eyes and cover my ears. I was tempted to slam the lid shut and stop the shrieks and sobs and cries that tore into my mind, imprinting themselves in my consciousness. I didn\u0027t. I stood there, hot bloody tears streaming down my face as the storm of anguish whipped around me like a hurricane, relentless and unending. My throat began to ache, and I couldn\u0027t stop shaking as the boy I cared for more than anything screamed and bled and begged for death, far beyond my reach. When it stopped, I was exhausted, numb. I wasn\u0027t aware of anything but the words coming out of the computer, Sarren\u0027s voice, flat and merciless. And Zeke, gasping for breath, choking on blood. \"This is not the end, little human. Oh, no. This is just a reminder that you can stop this at any time. But it makes no difference to me. We have many more hours to go, and I am just getting started.\" \"Stop!\" Zeke gasped. \"For the love of God, enough!\" He sobbed, panting, his voice broken and empty. \"I\u0027ll tell you. God forgive me...I\u0027ll tell you. Just...no more.\" I nearly collapsed, so grateful that it was over. Sarren\u0027s voice came again, full of quiet triumph. \"Where?\" \"An island,\" Zeke whispered. \"Eden...is on an island, in the middle of Lake Eerie.\" \"You\u0027re lying, little human.\" Sarren\u0027s voice hissed from the computer, and Zeke made a choked sound of fear and dread. \"Tell me where it really is, or we will go through this whole thing again from the top.\" \"No!\" Zeke\u0027s voice cracked. \"Please. I can\u0027t give you another answer, that\u0027s where it really is. Oh, God...\" I heard the self-loathing in his voice, the absolute despair. \"I\u0027ve betrayed everyone. Just kill me already. Let me die.\" I heard Sarren\u0027s smile. \"Yes, little human. Soon, you will feel nothing. Sweet oblivion. But, before I send you into the eternal night, would you like to say goodbye? Your friends will be arriving soon, I expect. The little bird, especially, might want to hear your voice, one last time. Is there anything you would like to tell her, before we say good-night?\" \"Allie ,\" Zeke breathed, sounding horrified. I wanted to reach for him, to grab his hand and never let go, but of course, he wasn\u0027t here. This was just an echo, his final words. \"I\u0027m sorr y,\" he whispered, and I heard the tears in his voice. \"I\u0027m so sorry. I wasn\u0027t strong enough. I couldn\u0027t...\" He took a ragged breath, and spoke with grim desperation. \"You have to stop him. Stop him from getting to Eden. He\u0027s planning to- Aaaagh!\" His voice dissolved into another scream, as if Sarren had interrupted him by jamming something sharp into his flesh. I wasn\u0027t expecting it, and cringed, squeezing his cross in a death grip. \"Now, now,\" Sarren said mildly as the cry died away. \"Let\u0027s not spoil the surprise. Is there anything else you\u0027d like to add before I kill you, little prince?\" \"Allison ,\" Zeke panted, his voice growing faint. \"I don\u0027t regret...anything...between us. I just wish...we had more time...that you could\u0027ve seen Eden with me. I should\u0027ve told you earlier...\" He paused, gasping for breath, but continued in a soft, steady voice. \"Allie, I...I love you.\" No, Zeke. I dropped my head into my hands, feeling Zeke\u0027s cross press against my skin, and sobbed. For myself, for Zeke, for this stupid, screwed-up world we were born into. For lost chances and unsaid words, and for the hope that seemed so bright and certain one moment, but so easily snuffed out the next. \"Take care of everyone in Eden,\" Zeke whispered as I stood there, shaking, trying to stop the flood of tears. \"Tell them...I\u0027m sorry I couldn\u0027t come back. But I...I\u0027ll be with my father soon. Tell Caleb and Bethany not to cry. We\u0027ll... see each other again someday. And then...it\u0027ll be forever.\" \"Magnificent,\" Sarren said. \"Truly touching. A fine requiem. But it is time to say goodbye, little prince. Are you ready?\" Zeke\u0027s voice was calm, now. Unafraid. \"I\u0027m ready.\" \"Then, let me release you from this mortal coil, and send you gently into the eternal night.\" I didn\u0027t hear the exact moment Sarren ended Zeke\u0027s life. I was just aware of his breathing, ragged at first, then seizing up, as if he could no longer gasp for air. And then, a long, agonizingly slow exhale, the last gulp departing his lungs, as Ezekiel\u0027s tortured breaths finally, irreversibly, stopped altogether. \"Good night, sweet prince,\" Sarren crooned, a velvet whisper. The recording clicked off.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-eternity-cure-blood-of-eden-2/page-22.html","bookId":2523,"book":{"id":2523,"title":"The Eternity Cure (Blood of Eden #2)","description":"Storyline: The Eternity Cure (Blood of Eden #2) She has done the unthinkable: died so that she might continue to live.
