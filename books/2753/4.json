{"id":83955,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"“I’ll return to my seat when we have an ump that can call fair. You’ve been calling bad this entire game.” Even though he said it loud enough for the entire park to hear, he never raised his voice. Dad’s a commanding man and someone this entire town admires.\\n\\n From behind the fence, Dad towers over the short, fat ump and waits for someone to make right what he views as a wrong. We’re carbon copies of each other, my dad and I. Sandy hair and brown eyes. Long legs. All shoulders and upper arms. Grandma said people like Dad and me were built for hard labor. Dad said we were built for baseball.\\n\\n My coach steps onto the field along with the coach from the other team. I agree. The ump’s been calling bad, on both sides, but I find it ironic that no one had the guts to say anything until Dad declared war.\\n\\n “Your dad’s the man.” Chris walks onto the pitcher’s mound.\\n\\n “Yeah.” The man. I glance over to Mom again and at the empty space where my older brother, Mark, used to sit. Mark’s absence stings more than I thought it would. I extend my glove out to Logan, who has inched away from the four men discussing the fairness of the calls. He automatically pitches the ball back.\\n\\n Chris scans the crowd. “Notice who came to the game?”\\n\\n I don’t bother looking. Lacy always attends Chris’s games.\\n\\n “Gwen,” he says with a canary-ate-the-cat grin. “Lacy heard she’s into you again.”\\n\\n I react without thinking and turn my head to search the bleachers for her. For two years, Gwen and baseball were my entire life. The breeze blows through Gwen’s long blond hair and, as if she could sense my stare, she looks at me and smiles. Last year, I loved that smile. A smile once reserved for me. Several months have passed since that time. Mom still loves her. I’m not sure how I feel anymore. A guy scales the bleachers and puts his arm around her. Yeah, rub it in, asshole. I’m well aware Gwen and I are done.\\n\\n “Play ball!” The voice of a new ump booms from the batter’s box. The old ump shakes hands with Dad on the other side of the fence.\\n\\n As I said, Dad believes in fairness and also thinks justice should be served with a man’s pride still intact. Well, for every man that isn’t my brother.\\n\\n Everyone off the field claps and watches my father return to his seat. Some people extend their hands to him. Others pat his back. Off the field, Dad’s the leader of this community. On the field, I’m the man.\\n\\n Out of the batter’s box, the batter takes a few practice swings. Two strikes. Three balls. And the kid knows I can bring heat. I whistle and gesture for Logan.\\n\\n Beside me, Chris laughs. He knows I’m up to no good. Logan approaches with his catcher’s mask on top of his head. “What’s up, boss man?”\\n\\n “Talk to me.”\\n\\n This is what a great catcher does. “The batter was sluggish, but he’s had a break, which means he’ll give it everything he has.\\n\\n Your fast has been wandering outside and he knows it.”\\n\\n I roll the ball in my fingers. “He’ll be expecting fast?”\\n\\n “If I was him, I’d expect you to throw fast,” says Chris.\\n\\n I shrug my shoulder and the muscles yell in protest. “Let’s do a changeup. He’ll read it as fast and won’t have enough time to readjust.”\\n\\n A smile slides across Chris’s face and he places his glove over his mouth. “You’re popping him out.”\\n\\n “We’re popping him out,” I repeat, hiding my own lips with my glove.\\n\\n I turn toward the field and whistle to get everyone’s attention. Chris goes back to short, slides his open hand across his chest, and taps his left arm with his right hand twice. The center fielder runs up, and our second baseman passes on the message. By the time I face the batter, Logan’s already sent the message to first and third.\\n\\n Logan flips his mask over his face, crouches into position, and holds his glove out for the pitch. Yeah, I’m closing this out.\\n\\n “SEE YOU TONIGHT, DAWG.” Chris kicks my foot as he walks past. He cradles his bat bag in one hand and Lacy’s hand in the other. Chris and I met Lacy when our schools combined in sixth grade. I liked her the day she skinned her knee playing football with the boys. Chris fell in love with her the day she pushed him on the playground after he tagged her out in baseball.\\n\\n They’ve been a couple since sophomore year—the year he grew a pair and finally asked her out.\\n\\n Lacy pulls a rubber band off her wrist and twists her brown hair into a messy bun. I love that she isn’t a girly girl. In order to keep up with me, Chris, and Logan, a girl has to have thick skin. Don’t get me wrong—she’s hot as hell, but Lacy doesn’t give a damn what others think of her. “We’re going to the party tonight.\\n\\n I want conversation and people and dancing.\\n\\n There is more to life than batting cages and dares.”\\n\\n With our fingers frozen on unlacing our cleats, Logan and I snap up our heads. Chris’s face blanches. “That’s sacrilegious, Lace. Take it back.”\\n\\n Next to me, Logan shoves his feet into his Nikes and tosses his cleats into his bag. “You don’t know the thrill of winning a good dare.”\\n\\n “Dares aren’t fun,” she says, the reprimand thick in her tone. “They’re crazy. You set my car on fire.”\\n\\n Logan holds up his hand. “I opened the window in time. In my defense, the upholstery is barely singed.”\\n\\n Chris and I chuckle at the memory of Lacy screaming as she was doing forty on a curve.\\n\\n The short story: a hamburger wrapper, a lighter, a stopwatch, and a dare. Logan accidentally dropped the blazing wrapper and it rolled under Lacy’s seat. One patented I’ll-kick-you-until-you-drop glare from Lacy shuts us both up. “I wish you’d get a girlfriend so she can drive your insane ass around.”\\n\\n “I can’t.” Logan waggles his eyebrows. “I’m Ryan’s wingman.”\\n\\n “Wingman.” She spits the word, then points a sparkly fingernail at both me and Logan, but I don’t miss how it lingers on me. “One of you needs to find a girl and commit. I’m tired of this testosterone bull.”\\n\\n Lacy hates the string of girls I’ve dated over the summer. She’s terrified I’ll influence Chris to drop her, though she should know better. Chris reveres her as his own personal religion.\\n\\n “You didn’t approve of the one I committed to last time,” I say. “Why should I try again?”\\n\\n “Because you can do better than evil.”\\n\\n I drop my tone. “Gwen’s not evil.” Gwen and I broke up, but there’s no reason to talk trash about her.\\n\\n “Speak of the devil,” mumbles Logan.\\n\\n “Hi, Ryan.” I turn my head to witness Gwen in all her glory. A blue cotton dress swishes around her tanned legs, and she wears a new-to-me pair of cowboy boots. Hand-curled\\n\\n ringlets bounce at the ends of her long blond hair. Surrounded by her three best girlfriends, she floats right past, but keeps her green eyes locked on me.\\n\\n “Gwen,” I say in return. Reaching the concession stand, she sweeps her hair over her shoulder as she refocuses her attention. I keep staring, trying to remember why we broke up.\\n\\n “Drama!” Lacy purposely blocks my view of Gwen’s ass. “She was nothing but drama.\\n\\n Remember? You said, ‘Lacy, there’s nothing real about her,’ and I said, ‘I know,’ and I happily threw an ‘I told you so’ in your face.\\n\\n Then you said, ‘Don’t let me go back to her,’ and I said, ‘Can I rip off your balls if you attempt it,’ and you said…”\\n\\n “No.” I said no because Lacy would actually do it, and I prefer my balls attached, but I did ask her to remind me of that conversation if I became weak. Logan and I should ask some girls to the movies next weekend. Hell, if Skater Girl had given me her number, I might even have considered calling her. God knows she was sexy as hell and when it comes to Gwen, a distraction always helps.\\n\\n “Come on, Logan,” says Chris. “I’ll give you a ride home.”\\n\\n Near the dugout, Dad wraps an arm around Mom as the two of them chat with Coach and a man dressed in a polo shirt and khakis. I wonder if anyone else notices how Mom leans slightly away from Dad’s body. Probably not.\\n\\n Mom’s in homecoming-court mode, all smiles and laughs.\\n\\n From over his shoulder, Dad indicates I should join them by giving me one of his rare I’m-proud-of-you smiles. It makes me unbalanced. Yeah, we won, but we win a lot.\\n\\n It’s what state champions do. Why the outpouring of pride now?\\n\\n As I said, Dad and I are clones, except for the age and the skin. Years of rain, sun, heat, and cold have seasoned his face. Owning a construction company requires a lot of time in the elements. “Ryan, this is Mr. Davis.”\\n\\n Mr. Davis and I both offer our hands at the same time. He’s tall, thin, and possibly my father’s age, except Mr. Davis doesn’t look weathered. “Call me Rob. Congratulations on a well-played game. You have a hell of a fastball.”\\n\\n “Thank you, sir.” I’ve heard it before. Mom tells everyone God gave me a gift, and while I’m not sure what I think of that, I won’t deny I’ve enjoyed the ride. Too bad Dad and I couldn’t garner any interest at pro baseball tryouts.\\n\\n I’m used to meetings and introductions.\\n\\n Because Dad owns his own company and has a seat on the city council, he’s into networking.\\n\\n Don’t get me wrong—Dad’s not the power-hungry sort. He declined running for mayor several times, even though my mom has been begging him to consider it for years. He’s just real into the community.\\n\\n Rob tilts his head to the field. “Do you mind throwing a couple for me?”\\n\\n Mom, Dad, and Coach share knowing grins and I feel like someone told a joke and left me out of the punch line. Or maybe I am the punch line. “Sure.”\\n\\n Rob pulls a radar gun and a business card out of the bag. He keeps the radar gun in his left hand and hands me the card. “I came here today to watch a player from the other team.\\n\\n Didn’t see what I was looking for with him, but I think I found something promising with you.”\\n\\n Dad claps my back, and his public showing of affection has me looking at him. Dad’s not a touchy guy. My family—we aren’t like that. I grip the card in my hand, and it takes everything I’ve got not to swear in shock in front of my mother. The man heading to the area behind home plate is Rob Davis, scout for the Cincinnati Reds.\\n\\n “Told you that spring tryouts weren’t the end of it.” Dad motions for me to follow Rob. “Go blow him away.”\\n\\n Beth\\n\\n THE OLDER PRISON GUARD, the nice one, walks beside me. He didn’t put the cuffs on supertight like the other dickhead guard. He isn’t in my face, trying to scare the shit out of me. He’s not trying to reenact a scene from Cops. He just walks next to me, ignoring my existence.\\n\\n I’m all for silence after listening to a girl come down from a bad acid trip last night.\\n\\n Maybe it was today.\\n\\n I don’t have a clue what time of day it is.\\n\\n They gave me breakfast.\\n\\n They discussed lunch.\\n\\n It must be morning. Maybe midday. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dare-you-to-pushing-the-limits-2/page-4.html","bookId":2753,"book":{"id":2753,"title":"Dare You To (Pushing the Limits #2)","description":"Storyline: Dare You To (Pushing the Limits #2) \\n Ryan lowers his lips to my ear. \"Dance with me, Beth.\" \\n \"No.\" I whisper the reply.
