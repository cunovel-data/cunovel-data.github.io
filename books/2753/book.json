I hate him and I hate myself for wanting him to touch me again.... \n \"I dare you...\" \n If anyone knew the truth about Beth Risk\u0027s home life, they\u0027d send her mother to jail and seventeen-year-old Beth who knows where. So she protects her mom at all costs. Until the day her uncle swoops in and forces Beth to choose between her mom\u0027s freedom and her own happiness. That\u0027s how Beth finds herself living with an aunt who doesn\u0027t want her and going to a school that doesn\u0027t understand her. At all. Except for the one guy who shouldn\u0027t get her, but does.... \n Ryan Stone is the town golden boy, a popular baseball star jock-with secrets he can\u0027t tell anyone.

Asking out the Skater girl who couldn\u0027t be less interested in him. \n But what begins as a dare becomes an intense attraction neither Ryan nor Beth expected. Suddenly, the boy with the flawless image risks his dreams-and his life-for the girl he loves, and the girl who won\u0027t let anyone get too close is daring herself to want it all....\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/dare-you-to-pushing-the-limits-2.jpg","author":"Katie McGarry","type":"Young Adult","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":57,"category":{"id":9,"name":"Young Adult","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
