Lacy will be pissed someone is encroaching on her territory.”\n “That’s exactly what’s going to happen,” I say sarcastically.\n “Carly’s nice.”\n “She’s chipper.”\n “Same thing.”\n “Nice is nice. Chipper is annoying.”\n “We should double-date with them.”\n My eyes almost pop out of my head. “Are you kidding me? I’m about to walk out onto that football field and make a fool out of myself and you want me to consider double-dating with Mr. and Mrs. Chipper? Have you lost your mind?”\n Ryan chuckles, then winks. “I just wanted to see you get aggravated.”\n I wrinkle my nose. “You’re annoying.”\n He lets go of my hand, slips his arms around my waist, and pulls me close to his strong body. “You’re beautiful.”\n The corners of my lips turn up and I slide my right arm around his neck. “I miss touching you with both hands.”\n “It’s weird seeing the ribbon on your other wrist,” he says.\n I shiver when Ryan caresses the sensitive skin above my cast and rubs the small of my back. Joyous and devious warmth spreads throughout my body. “I never take it off.”\n “I miss you in my bed,” he murmurs so only I can hear.\n My smile grows and Ryan’s face reddens.\n “That’s not what I meant. I meant I miss sleeping with you.”\n I know what he means. “It’s a little hard to slip out with a broken hand.”\n He lowers his head to mine and his hold on me tightens. “I’m sorry I didn’t protect you better.”\n “Ryan, no. I would have died if it wasn’t for you.”\n “It’s over now,” he whispers against my mouth.\n I expectantly part my lips for his kiss. “It is.”\n “Mr. Stone. Ms. Risk,” calls the assistant principal. “A little more space between you and a lot more paying attention. It’s time for you to get onto the field.”\n I deflate and wrap my hand on Ryan’s bent arm so he can escort me out underneath the glaring lights. I wanted Ryan to kiss me. I needed him to kiss me.\n Over the PA system, our names are announced and Ryan leads me to the fifty-yard line. People yell and scream, the loudest cheers coming from the section where we left Lacy, Chris, and Logan.\n “When you win,” says Ryan, “don’t forget you said you’d keep that tiara on your pretty little head all night.”\n My eyes widen as I realize how I can get exactly what I want. We stop in the middle of the field and I turn to him. “Kiss me. Not just a peck. The real deal.”\n Ryan glances around at the bleachers full of hundreds of people. “Excuse me?”\n “I, Beth Risk, do double dog dare you to kiss me in front of all these people.”\n Ryan’s eyes brighten and the arrogant smile that makes my heart trip over itself spreads across his face. “Are you forgetting dare etiquette? You have to dare before you can double dog dare.”\n I roll my eyes. “Fine. I dare you to kiss me.”\n “And if I do?”\n “If I win homecoming, which I won’t, I’ll wear that damn tiara for a week straight.”\n He cradles my face with both his hands. His lips whisper against mine and I ache for him to kiss me. My mind whines that he won’t do it, but then he nibbles on my lower lip. His mouth parts and the two of us move our lips hungrily in time with one another.\n In between gasps of air our names are called as the winners. I feel Ryan’s lips tug into a smile before he says one word: “Can.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dare-you-to-pushing-the-limits-2/page-57.html","bookId":2753,"book":{"id":2753,"title":"Dare You To (Pushing the Limits #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Dare You To (Pushing the Limits #2) \n Ryan lowers his lips to my ear. \"Dance with me, Beth.\" \n \"No.\" I whisper the reply.
