My wee trout here” — he gave an exaggerated squeeze to her shoulders — “has a sister who just married into a Jamaican coffee plantation.”\\n\\n Marjorie shrugged, attempting to jostle Cormac\u0027s arm from around her shoulders. Clearly, he wanted to speak for both of them. The thought that he might believe her incapable of sustaining their drama vexed her.\\n\\n “Jamaica. Of course,” Forbes said with a knowing nod. “Croydon, is it? I\u0027ve an uncle who\u0027s spent much time in the Indies.”\\n\\n Marjorie saw Cormac\u0027s jaw tighten. They were on dangerous ground. They\u0027d armed themselves with rudimentary information about the coffee business in the West Indies, but they\u0027d also known that nothing could prepare them for the detailed questions that would invariably arise.\\n\\n She decided that, as a woman, her mistakes would be seen as excusable, expected even. The notion galled her, but she dove in all the same. “Yes, in Croydon. My brother-in-law will be pulling Hughie in as a partner.”\\n\\n “Aye,” Cormac broke in quickly. “\u0027Twas most generous of my in-laws. Though it\u0027s a bigger enterprise than I\u0027ve ever faced before. \u0027Tis why we came here… for… “ Cormac looked meaningfully at the ship.\\n\\n “Ah. You\u0027ll be wanting introductions, of course.” A smile spread across the bailie\u0027s face. “I\u0027m hosting a dinner tomorrow, and I insist you come. There will be folk in attendance whom you must meet.”\\n\\n “I\u0027d be honored.” Cormac glanced down at Marjorie and gave her an assessing look. She imagined she saw a warning in his eyes, and it rankled. “Though I imagine yours isn\u0027t an affair for women.” She glared back up at him. “But Hughie,” she said through gritted teeth, “I would simply adore dining with the bailie.”\\n\\n “And so you shall,” Forbes said merrily. “Wives are most welcome at my affairs. In fact, you\u0027ll have much to discuss with the other women. It\u0027s a whole new world in the Indies; there will be much for you to prepare for, my lady. There is the intense heat, for one. And such a remarkable variety of flora and fauna!”\\n\\n “Oh! Flora and fauna?” Marjorie clapped her hands. Hughie\u0027s little trout wasn\u0027t done yet. “How uniquely fortuitous! My husband does adore our feathered kin.”\\n\\n “Truly?” Forbes looked taken aback.\\n\\n “Truly,” Marjorie replied before Cormac had a chance to. She avoided his gaze and the daggers she felt pointed her way. But really, she couldn\u0027t abide being silenced or shut out.\\n\\n “Any particular… species?” Forbes asked Cormac. “That is the correct phraseology, is it not?” Marjorie wrested the attention back to her. “Rare varieties of duck are an especial favorite. A veritable duck expert is my husband. Isn\u0027t that right, Hughie?”\\n\\n She finally spared Cormac a glance, deciding he looked not unlike a cat ready to pounce. He managed a tight twitch of his head, which she imagined could be construed as a nod.\\n\\n “Ducks… “ Forbes mused. “Are there ducks to be found in-?”\\n\\n Marjorie didn\u0027t know the first thing about ducks. Nor did she, at the moment, know just how she might go about bringing her extemporaneous ramble to a close. “Oh, sadly it\u0027s no more ducks for Hughie. My Lord Brodie finds himself eager to move on. He\u0027s greatly anticipating recording the various tropical species found in the Indies.” She and her foolish temper had her talked into a corner. Forbes seemed to be formulating a question, and the prospect alarmed her.\\n\\n Just when she began to worry that Cormac was going to leave her hung out to dry, he chimed in. “That\u0027s quite enough about me, trout. I\u0027m certain our new acquaintance has no interest in the banalities of my pastime.” He gave a patronizing — and, she\u0027d daresay, overly firm — pat to her arm.\\n\\n Forbes looked visibly relieved. “Well, I must admit to a dreadful lack of knowledge where… uh… birds are concerned.”\\n\\n Thank goodness. Marjorie breathed a quiet sigh of relief. Her whimsical speech had really been quite reckless.\\n\\n She was certain she\u0027d hear about it later.\\n\\n She glanced up at Cormac and pursed her lips not to smile. Reckless maybe, but how it had been worth it. The man needed to learn a little humor, and if ducks were the thing to chisel through that stony facade of his, then so be it.\\n\\n “I may not know birds,” Forbes continued, “but I do know business. And the plantations of the Indies are quite the opportunity. Your brother-in-law sounds like a very generous man indeed. But I\u0027m afraid I didn\u0027t catch his name… ?”\\n\\n Panic skittered up her spine. She hadn\u0027t reckoned on the bailie actually knowing anyone in Jamaica. She forced a brittle smile onto her face. “His name is John. Oh, John! Our dear, lovely John!” With exaggerated dismay, Marjorie brought a hand to her nose and mouth. “But Hughie, I\u0027m afraid this stench is getting to me. Shan\u0027t we be on our way?”\\n\\n As much as Cormac wanted to watch her flail in her own verbal traps, he knew he needed to get them away from there as soon as possible. “I see I\u0027ve been remiss, my wee trout. If you\u0027ll excuse us, Forbes.”\\n\\n “But of course,” he replied grandly. “The docks are no place for the fairer sex. I shall send my own carriage for you, tomorrow at six, at the… ?”\\n\\n “Cross Keys Inn. Dockside.” Cormac whisked Marjorie around, putting space between them and the bailie. Fairer sex? How about more unruly, wore taxing, more maddening… He strained to keep their charade while Forbes was still in sight. Mustering affected cheer, he called over his shoulder, “Tomorrow at six then!” When they were out of view, he dropped her arm as though she were leprous. “What in blazes were you thinking?”\\n\\n “Well, nothing, obviously.” She shook her arm, flinching away from him even though he\u0027d already separated from her. “Seeing as mere wives are good for naught but thinking about the weather and—”\\n\\n “And don\u0027t forget flora and fauna.” Blasted woman. He didn\u0027t know where she came up with such nonsense. “Seems as though you had much to say on that particular topic.”\\n\\n “You provoked me.”\\n\\n “I?” Cormac stopped in his tracks, “I provoked you?”\\n\\n “Yes. You\u0027ve been goading me since we left Dunnottar, in fact.”\\n\\n He merely stared at her. She\u0027d dressed as a wealthy lady would, in a blue-green gown that set off the color of her eyes. The tight bodice pressed her breasts into two perfect globes; all day it had been an effort to keep his gaze above her chin. And she claimed he provoked her?\\n\\n She stormed on, toward the inn, and he jogged to catch up.\\n\\n “How, exactly, have I managed to so bedevil you? By helping you on this mission of yours? By keeping you safe?\\n\\n Or was it when I fed you and gave you a bed while I slept on the floor?”\\n\\n “You didn\u0027t have to—” She stopped herself from\\n\\n saying something, and Cormac couldn\u0027t help but imagine her completed thought.\\n\\n “Didn\u0027t have to what, Ree?” he asked in a low whisper. Stepping closer, he took her arm, and he might as well have stepped before an open flame, so much did her proximity scorch him. “Sleep apart from you?” She blushed, giving him a breathless look that made him wild and wishing he had crawled into bed with her.\\n\\n Marjorie pulled away and strode on, entering the inn with an angry sweep of her skirts. “You didn\u0027t have to speak for me at the docks. I am perfectly capable—”\\n\\n “Of getting yourself into trouble.” He lowered his voice so as not to be overheard, nodding a perfunctory greeting to the innkeeper as they passed.\\n\\n “Oh Hughie, I know a fine husband like you would never allow that to happen.” She stormed up the stairs to their door, fumbling with the lock.\\n\\n Cormac snatched the key from her to open it.\\n\\n “And Hughie, how wonderful that your little trout has such a great man like you to open doors for her.” She stomped into their bedroom. “To make her decisions, and to speak for her.”\\n\\n “Och, Ree, stop this.” He closed the door. The woman had lost her head. Force decisions upon her? The concept was laughable. Cormac would be first in line to swear there wasn\u0027t a man alive capable of taking control of Marjorie. “I only worried—”\\n\\n “You worried I\u0027d mess it up, didn\u0027t you?” She struggled to unlace her shoes and finally just kicked them off.\\n\\n Standing, she panted before him, lips parted and cheeks flushed. “You worried I couldn\u0027t handle a simple act.” He worried she\u0027d get hurt. He worried she\u0027d never find her Davie. He worried the lad was already dead. He worried her heart might break as irrevocably as his had so many years before.\\n\\n He worried that the sad look in her eyes would never go away.\\n\\n “That\u0027s not it at all.”\\n\\n “You worried I\u0027d ruin everything like I always do.”\\n\\n “Stop it, Marjorie.” She was intentionally misunderstanding. She\u0027d whipped herself into a lather, her breasts rising and falling with each breath. He stepped closer.\\n\\n “Isn\u0027t that it, Hughie?” She tore the comb from her hair, and slammed it down on the table. Long curls cascaded over her shoulders. “You didn\u0027t think I\u0027d be able to carry on a simple conversation without—”\\n\\n “Stop.” He took another step.\\n\\n She sneered. “Oh Hughie, am I bothering—”\\n\\n Another step. “Stop it with this Hughie business.”\\n\\n “Make me!”\\n\\n He did — with a kiss.\\n\\n Chapter 17\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t fight it. Feeling had seared back to life in his numb heart, and he\u0027d awoken ravenous. Ree was nothing but feeling and passion, and it set him on fire.\\n\\n He kissed her, pouring the whole of his godforsaken soul into it. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-highlander-clan-macalpin-1/page-25.html","bookId":2656,"book":{"id":2656,"title":"Devil\u0027s Highlander (Clan MacAlpin #1)","description":"Storyline: Devil\u0027s Highlander (Clan MacAlpin #1) \\n After Scotland\u0027s Civil Wars, the orphaned brothers and sisters of the MacAlpin clan reclaimed the abandoned Dunnochen Castle as their birthright.
