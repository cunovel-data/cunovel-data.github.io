Look at you,” he said, raking her body with his gaze. “You\u0027re a treasure.” He pulled the edge of her gown from the floor, rubbing the rich fabric between his fingers. “For me, this” — he held up the hem and, even in the low light, it shimmered — “this is a masquerade. And yet this is what you deserve. Wealth and finery.” He tossed the dress back down. “You should have a handsome lord with an estate and a fleet of maids at your disposal. Not a poor fisherman living in a tumble of rocks.” Cormac was so much more than a mere fisherman. It baffled her that he didn\u0027t see it. “What if I want a poor fisherman?” He gave her a rueful smile. “Then you strike a poor bargain.” “In any case, money matters not. I\u0027ve money from Humphrey. It simply doesn\u0027t matter.” She stilled his hand with her own. “Cormac, don\u0027t you see? I\u0027d live the rest of my days, happily raising our children in your tumble of rocks, if it meant we could be together.” Pain flashed across his face. “Children? How could I ever raise children? Christ, Ree, how could I, of all men, raise a son?” “I think you\u0027d do a fine job of it.” “Children,” he mused, raising his brows as though their existence had only just then occurred to him. “Aye.” She rolled onto her side to face him. “A house full of sons. With your dark hair, and your long, strong bones. They\u0027d have your eyes.” She combed her fingers through his hair, drew them along the side of his cheek, his jaw. She wondered what held him back. Was it the thought of children that made him hesitate, or the thought of children with her? “Although they might have a touch of their mother in them, too,” she added, looking away. “Whoever she might be.” “But I already know the mother of my children. And I want them to have her eyes.” Cormac\u0027s voice was husky with emotion. He cupped her cheek, bringing her gaze to his. Easing Marjorie onto her back, he leaned his body over hers. He studied her face, tracing a delicate line along the tops of her cheekbones, over her brows. “I\u0027ll have sons with eyes that are blue like jewels, vivid and bright. Eyes that see the good in the world. Eyes that smile. Your eyes, Ree, my love.” He kissed her then, tenderly. Mending two hearts that had spent a lifetime broken. Chapter 30 “What\u0027s to say a boy like Paddy won\u0027t be next?” Marjorie chewed a forkful of eggs with great enthusiasm. Swallowing, she pointed her fork at Cormac. “I tell you, we must destroy that ship.” “Easy, Ree,” he said with a laugh. They sat on a love seat before the hearth, and he reached over their tray to grab her waggling fist. “No need to spear me with the cutlery. Fiona had enough to explain this morning, bringing her mistress such a heaping portion of food. Impaling me with the silver will do naught for our concealment.” He took a bite of black pudding and chewed thoughtfully. “Criwens but your uncle Humphrey eats well.” “I\u0027ve been thinking about this black powder,” Marjorie said abruptly. She snatched a triangle of toast, buttering it with great zeal. “How much would it take to explode an entire ship?” “You wee savage.” He put his fork down to study her. If the swirl of emotions on her face was any indication, the woman\u0027s mind was spinning like a top. He nodded to her knife. “Is the plan to avenge yourself on the toast?” Ignoring him, she snapped a bite from the corner and, putting a hand in front of her mouth, she spoke as she chewed. “Of course, we\u0027ll need to figure out how to free the men held captive. There are slaves still aboard, don\u0027t forget. And then I think the next order of business is for me to go to Saint Machar and confront Archie.” He barked out a laugh — so preposterous was the idea — and promptly quieted himself. It\u0027d do no good to bring the servants running. “Will you indeed?” Her eyes narrowed at his sarcasm. “Cormac MacAl—” “No, Ree.” Her amateur efforts at spying had been successful thus far. But that\u0027d been before. Now he was certain all manner of ruffians were scouring the streets of Aberdeen for a woman of her description. “There will be no more. I am deadly serious.” She set down her utensils with a clack. “You can\u0027t expect me to wait around for more children to be taken.” “Of course not. We will do all in our power to stop it. How could you doubt otherwise?” He stood abruptly to pace a circle around her room, then stopped and pinned her with a look. He felt raw, and he needed her to understand. “Don\u0027t think I feel this any less than you. Not a day goes by that I don\u0027t remember Aidan. He was my twin, Ree. I\u0027d not have another lad suffer his fate.” Her eyes were wide, and he walked back to her, worried that his harsh words had upset her. “But,” he said, kneeling before her to take her hands, “I\u0027ll not wait and worry that you\u0027re out there, alone and in danger, somehow suffering the same fate as Aidan. I cannot lose you. I will not.” Her eyes softened. “I can\u0027t lose you either.” “And so you won\u0027t. I\u0027m an expert. Trust me, I will handle this. I\u0027ll not have you flouncing about Saint Machar\u0027s, flirting with danger.” “You just don\u0027t want me flouncing and flirting with Archie.” She gave him a wicked smile. “Not unless you wish me to kill the man,” he deadpanned. He sat beside her again, and the dishes on the tray clinked with his weight. “Truly, Ree. Let me do this for you. I spent a lifetime training. I have the devil\u0027s own knowledge of how to kill, how to destroy. Let me use it for good. I will destroy the ship. And I promise you, we will figure out a way you can help, too.” Marjorie was quiet for a time, and he braced himself for her uplifted chin, for one of her rebellions. Instead, she gave him a thoughtful smile. “I trust you, Cormac. And more than anything, I love you. It will be as you wish it.” The muscles in his shoulders released. She\u0027d let him handle it. In destroying the Oliphant, he\u0027d avenge Aidan. But more, Cormac would avenge the evils of his youth, in using his terrible skills for good. She tilted her head, pensive. “So you\u0027ll burn the ship?” “No, love. I\u0027ll sink it.” Fiona had always dreamed of a houseful of boys, but not like this. “Stop,” she ordered them, but it was in vain. She darted to the corner to break up yet another tussle, sighing heavily. She\u0027d wanted to do a favor for her mistress, but this was proving more grueling than she\u0027d anticipated. “How does wee Marjorie manage to keep you rascals in line? Mind me, stop right now.” Ignoring her, they wrestled their way into her worktable, and a wooden bowl clattered to the floor. It was two of the bigger lads, and their size had her at a disadvantage. She flinched away from a flying fist, clearing her throat to shout, “Stop!” A banging at the door finally put an end to it. She put a finger to her mouth signaling quiet, though it wasn\u0027t necessary. They\u0027d all frozen, meeting each other\u0027s eyes, stricken. There was another knock, more insistent than the last. “Fiona? Are you there?” Archie? Hastily smoothing her hair, she stepped to the door. Though she made an effort to be silent, she feared the visitor would surely be able to hear her nervous breathing from the other side. “Fiona? It\u0027s Arch. Are you there? I heard a racket.” He jiggled the latch. “Is everything all right?” Heaving a sigh of relief, she opened the door and whisked him inside. “Losh, Arch, but it\u0027s good to see you.” He took in the tableau of boys in various states of disarray. Raising a brow, he said, “There was word of some unlawful disputes in these parts, but I see the reports were vastly understated.” She felt her cheeks heat. Even though she wasn\u0027t entirely certain what he referred to, she did know the current chaos mortified her. “Disputes?” “Aye.” He pulled the tallest of the boys to standing and straightened his shirt. “I\u0027d heard there was some violence by the docks, not far from here. I knew where you lived. Do you remember? When I came to stitch your wound… ?” He trailed off, looking embarrassed. When he spoke again, he didn\u0027t meet her eyes. “Och, Fiona, I pray I didn\u0027t overstep.” Remember? He came once to dress her cut finger, and she\u0027d thought of his visit every day since. His upright form had filled the small cottage with a gende, understated presence. He\u0027d been attentive and kind, his manner striking her as protective, taking care of things in such a manly way. He was everything her father wasn\u0027t. “I remember, yes, of course,” she said quietly. “But who are these boys? Surely you\u0027ve never mentioned brothers.” Archie scanned the room, and eyes alighting on Davie, he did a double take. “Davie? Could it be?” A sort of bewildered caution crumpled the boy\u0027s face, and he tucked himself behind Fiona\u0027s skirts. She twisted back to scruff his red hair. “It\u0027s all right, lad. Don\u0027t you remember Archie? He\u0027s the nice man from Saint Machar\u0027s.” Davie gave a wary half shrug and went to sit with the others in front of the fire for an impromptu game of merrills. “I\u0027ll not understand it,” she said, referring to the sudden quiet. She chalked it up to Archie\u0027s steady presence calming them all down. “How is this even possible?” He pitched his voice low and had to step close to Fiona to be heard in the crowded space. “I can\u0027t believe it\u0027s Davie.” “Marjorie saved them all, God love her.” Fiona smiled wide. “I\u0027m caring for them, as a favor.” “But surely you can\u0027t keep them here.” Archie shook his head, perplexed. “They should be with me. At Westhall.” She hesitated. “But Marjorie said there was no room.” “No room?” His eyes softened. “Oh Fiona, dear. Perhaps you misunderstood. There\u0027s always room at Saint Machar.” Elation filled her. “Oh, Arch, that would be lovely.” The boys had been overwhelming. And they\u0027d overwhelmed her father, too. He\u0027d not taken kindly to the lot, despite her mistress\u0027s bribe. He\u0027d begun yelling at them, and she worried it was only a matter of time before shouts became hits.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-highlander-clan-macalpin-1/page-42.html","bookId":2656,"book":{"id":2656,"title":"Devil\u0027s Highlander (Clan MacAlpin #1)","description":"Storyline: Devil\u0027s Highlander (Clan MacAlpin #1) After Scotland\u0027s Civil Wars, the orphaned brothers and sisters of the MacAlpin clan reclaimed the abandoned Dunnochen Castle as their birthright.
