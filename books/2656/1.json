Their mothers were out, wanting to experience as much as possible during their weekend visit to the city. It had left the three of them with the run of the house, and they were taking full advantage. “Marjorie wants to.”\\n\\n “But we always play the Ogilvy fire.”\\n\\n “I\u0027ll have your head,” Cormac shouted, ignoring his brother. He waved his wooden sword with a dramatic flourish.\\n\\n “I will claim my revenge!”\\n\\n Aidan narrowed his eyes fiercely. “Why do I have to be Campbell again?” Marjorie stepped forward to peer at his face. “Because your nose is bigger than Cormac\u0027s.”\\n\\n “But we\u0027re twins!”\\n\\n Cormac quickly shrugged. “It\u0027s not my fault we don\u0027t look alike.”\\n\\n “I always play the cursed Campbell.” Aidan wiped his nose on his sleeve, a boyish gesture that robbed the menace from his words.\\n\\n “Revenge shall be mine, I say!” Cormac spun, grabbing Marjorie\u0027s hand. A quick jerk of his head loosed his dark brown hair from where it had tangled in his lashes. “Fear not, Lady Ogilvy, I shall save you from the blaze!” Aidan threw his wooden sword to the ground. “Why do you always get to save Marjorie?” Cormac\u0027s gaze met Marjorie\u0027s, and his chest swelled. He always got to save Marjorie because Marjorie was his.\\n\\n Marjorie scooped up Aidan\u0027s sword, thrusting it back to him hilt-first. “That\u0027s just how we play it, Aidan.” A flush of color brightened her face, and Cormac stared. The twins had known her since birth, and in their ten years, only recently had he noticed the pretty blushes that sometimes reddened her cheeks. The phenomenon confused and mesmerized him both.\\n\\n Shooting Cormac a glance, Marjorie paced to the window, and he wondered if maybe she\u0027d noticed him noticing.\\n\\n He paused only a moment before following at her heels. Leaning against the windowsill, he let his shoulder graze hers, making as though to study the street below. He inhaled deeply. Lately Marjorie even smelled different. Nice, and sweet, like a lady.\\n\\n “You boys should climb the chimney,” she said suddenly, “like the sweeps.” They both watched as a handful of chimney boys straggled out from a cart on the street below. The oldest couldn\u0027t have been a day over eight, the others seemed closer to five or six, and their brooms and metal tools were almost as large as they were. “My castle is afire, and you\u0027ll need to climb to save me.”\\n\\n “You mean up in the chimney?” Aidan scowled. “I\u0027m not climbing your uncle\u0027s stinking chimney.” Cormac swung around, leveling his pretend sword at his twin\u0027s chest. “You\u0027ll not speak so to the lady.”\\n\\n “Those boys do it,” she said, pointing out the window.\\n\\n “You climb the chimney,” Aidan told her in disbelief.\\n\\n “I\u0027ll do no such thing.” She set her shoulders and continued to stare intently out the window. “I shall wait here for my rescue.”\\n\\n “Aidan,” Cormac warned, “Mum will be back soon. And soon we\u0027ll be gone from Aberdeen, and then it\u0027s back to home. Don\u0027t be so contrary—”\\n\\n “She\u0027s afraid.” Aidan went to the window to study the ragtag boys covered in soot and tar as they disappeared into the neighboring town house. “I should\u0027ve known a lass would be afraid.”\\n\\n “I am not afraid.”\\n\\n “Och, she\u0027s not afraid, Aidan. As I recall, she climbed higher than you last time.”\\n\\n “That was a tree, not up into some stinkin\u0027 chimney.” Aidan crossed his arms defiantly. “And I could\u0027ve gone higher if I\u0027d wanted.”\\n\\n “It\u0027s just that I tore my dress last time.”\\n\\n “Your family has enough money to buy you twenty new dresses,” Aidan said. “Your mum is with our mum right now, buying you even more.”\\n\\n “Leave it.” Cormac tried desperately to keep his eyes from said dress. The delicate lace along her neck and sleeves fascinated him. When had she started wearing such ladylike clothes? “Her family has money, but not so much that she can go about mussing her gowns.”\\n\\n “All right, then.” Marjorie turned, giving them a regal sweep of her eyes. “We shall all climb the stinking chimney.”\\n\\n “You don\u0027t need to, Ree,” Cormac told her quietly, using his private nickname for her. “We\u0027ll play something else. Come on, Aidan,” he said more loudly, “let\u0027s play at something else.”\\n\\n “I dare you.” Marjorie set her hands on her hips. “Whoever climbs fastest, wins. Unless it\u0027s you boys who are afraid.”\\n\\n Cormac bristled at once. “I\u0027m not afraid.” He stormed to the fireplace and knelt down to peer up the flue. The boys working as sweeps were small, most no older than eight. But her uncle Humphrey\u0027s chimney struck him as overlarge — wide enough to accommodate their bigger bodies. The hearthstones were charred from the years, but the grate was cold, still blanketed with ashes from the previous night\u0027s fire.\\n\\n Not that it mattered. Cormac would climb the tightest of tunnels with a full blaze beneath his feet if it would prove his worth above Aidan\u0027s. His eyes darted back to Marjorie. Her full attention was on him, pinning him with an unreadable look. It made him feel like a conquering hero. “I fear nothing,” he repeated, standing tall.\\n\\n Curling his lip, Aidan waved at the fireplace. “You climb it then, if you\u0027re so keen to.” With a decisive nod, Cormac stepped onto the grate, his head and shoulders disappearing into the darkness.\\n\\n “Cormac,” Marjorie gasped. “You\u0027re truly going to climb it?”\\n\\n “I\u0027m not climbing it,” Aidan said to nobody in particular.\\n\\n Marjorie craned her neck to look back out the window. “Hurry now. We\u0027ve not much time before the sweeps come to Uncle\u0027s house.”\\n\\n The inside of the chimney was cool. Staccato gusts of wind whistled in, hitting him with surprisingly fresh bursts of air. Cormac put his hands on the stones. The passage was narrower than it\u0027d looked, and he tried not to think how high it went. Despite the air blowing in, he was unable to see any light shining in from the top.\\n\\n “What\u0027s it like in there?” Marjorie\u0027s voice echoed loudly in the cramped space.\\n\\n Cormac skidded his hands up along the stones, groping for seams that could be used as climbing holds. Soot clung thickly in the mortar and was unexpectedly gummy under his fingertips and nails. “It\u0027s sticky!” His fingers found a deep groove between stones. “Here goes,” he muttered, and jumped, pulling himself up hard.\\n\\n His feet scrabbled wildly in the air. He heard an explosion of hysterical laughter and grunted, “Shut your trap, Aid!”\\n\\n Cormac began to slip, and he brought his knees up hard to brace himself in the narrow passageway. A sharp ridge cut into his calf, and he hissed with the pain of it. But he was up off the ground now and spared a quick laugh at his success.\\n\\n He worked silently for a time, his elbows and legs splayed out, slowly maneuvering higher, pushing from his feet and pulling with his hands.\\n\\n The light from below dimmed, and the sound of breathing echoed up the chamber. “You still in there?” his brother called.\\n\\n “Move it, stink breath.” Cormac scuffed his toe along the stones, sending old mortar crumbling onto his twin below. “I can\u0027t see.”\\n\\n Aidan chuckled. “When the climbing boys stop their climbing, the master sweep lights a fire to get them going again.”\\n\\n Marjorie\u0027s voice carried up, hollow and distant. “You\u0027ll do no such thing!”\\n\\n “Ow!” Aidan screeched. “Criminy, Marj, I was only joking.”\\n\\n “It\u0027s Marjorie, you beast.”\\n\\n “That\u0027s the way, Ree,” Cormac said. “Now, stop breathing my air,” he growled to his brother. “I think it\u0027s getting smaller up here.”\\n\\n “You getting scared?” Aidan taunted.\\n\\n “No, I\u0027m not getting — oh!” Cormac\u0027s foot slipped, and his elbows scraped hard along the chimney walls as he began to slide down.\\n\\n Marjorie shrieked.\\n\\n Slamming his knees out, he braced himself along the passageway to stop his fall.\\n\\n “That\u0027s enough, Cormac,” she cried. “You win! Now just come back down.” He smiled in the darkness. “I best get a good prize for this, Ree.” He flushed as he said it, wondering what exactly he\u0027d meant by the words.\\n\\n He redoubled his efforts, climbing up at a rapid clip, trying to ignore the way the flue narrowed the higher he went. Hands slide up, fingers hold tight, knees brace the wall… and ups-a-daisy. “I\u0027m getting the way of it now.\\n\\n Like a wee monkey I am.” Laughing, he grew careless, and his shirtsleeve snagged on the sharp edge of a stone.\\n\\n “Och, hell.”\\n\\n “Och, hell, what?” Marjorie sounded nervous.\\n\\n For once Cormac ignored her. He tried to jiggle his sleeve free, but that only pulled it taut. He was stuck.\\n\\n Unexpected fear struck like lightning, splicing his chest.\\n\\n “You answer me right now, Cormac MacAlpin,” Marjorie said sternly.\\n\\n “Och, hell, what?”\\n\\n He shimmied his arm up to free it, but only grew more tightly wedged into the passage. His heart kicked hard in his chest. “I… I think I\u0027m stuck.”\\n\\n Aidan laughed. “You\u0027ve ate too many pasties from the Aberdeen baker!”\\n\\n “It\u0027s not funny,” Marjorie snapped.\\n\\n Though their chatter carried to him, it didn\u0027t fully pierce his thoughts. He was trapped, and that fact alone filled his head.\\n\\n “I\u0027m stuck,” he said, and though his voice was brave, he knew his twin would understand the truth of it.\\n\\n “Aye, I hear you.” There was a clatter from below as Aidan propped the grate onto its side, like an impromptu ladder. “Och, Marjorie, could your uncle no\u0027 sweep the bloody hearth?” Aidan was silent then, trying to find his balance. He fell once, then carefully clambered back up to teeter on the top edge of the grate. It plunged Cormac into total blackness. “You get to save Marjorie, but it seems you need me to save you.” His tone was light, but Cormac heard the seriousness underneath. Aidan would help him. They always got each other out of jams. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-highlander-clan-macalpin-1/page-1.html","bookId":2656,"book":{"id":2656,"title":"Devil\u0027s Highlander (Clan MacAlpin #1)","description":"Storyline: Devil\u0027s Highlander (Clan MacAlpin #1) \\n After Scotland\u0027s Civil Wars, the orphaned brothers and sisters of the MacAlpin clan reclaimed the abandoned Dunnochen Castle as their birthright.
