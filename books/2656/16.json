I won\u0027t be angry. Please, though. You must tell me.”\n “He looks like all the other men. Just some middling lord. But then I saw the coin purse tied at his waist. And I remembered, I\u0027d seen him that day, too, the day Davie was took. I didn\u0027t do nothing wrong,” he added quickly. “I swear it. But even if I don\u0027t do no cutpursing no more, don\u0027t mean I don\u0027t have eyes, and this were a big, brown pouch, sure filled with coin. I saw it that day, and I saw it again yestreen. I\u0027d swear it was the same man, both days.”\n “What\u0027d he look like?” she asked steadily. Energy crackled to life, zipping up her spine and to her fingertips.\n She was onto something. Paddy was a sweet boy, and he\u0027d turned his life around, but he had seen some tough times and had a nose for trouble like no other.\n “He… “ Paddy shrugged. “He looked like other men.”\n “He looked like other men,” she repeated. “So, an average-looking man? Was he the one who hit you?”\n “Aye.” Paddy reached up, running his finger over his scab. “He thought I was after his purse.” Was he? She\u0027d need to think on that later. First, she needed to find out what Paddy knew. The pertinent clues that he didn\u0027t even realize he knew. She leaned closer to start her interrogation.\n Cormac leaned in the doorway watching Marjorie tend some alley rat. He folded his arms at his chest, marveling at her spirit. If he\u0027d expected her to cower at home in fear after the incident at the docks, he realized now he\u0027d been gravely wrong.\n The news he\u0027d gathered at the docks gave him hope that this Davie still lived. He\u0027d come to Saint Machar to question the other lads, but blast it if she hadn\u0027t beat him there. He fought the aggravating sensation that once again he found himself following in her wake.\n Westhall Manse. His eyes scanned the kitchen, a grim chamber bearing sooty walls and the smell of charred meat.\n Manse indeed.\n His eyes went back to Marjorie. She hadn\u0027t seen him yet, so engrossed was she with the boy. Clearly she\u0027d come for her usual charity work. He realized he\u0027d never asked her exactly what that work entailed. He watched as she gingerly swabbed the boy\u0027s cheek.\n So good, so true. That was Marjorie. She\u0027d always been thus. Full of vinegar she might be, but she\u0027d always been kind to the core. Most lasses would\u0027ve been broken after Aidan\u0027s kidnap. But Ree was made of stronger stuff. She\u0027d turned her pain into something else, directing it to good and charitable works.\n He watched her take the boy\u0027s hands in hers. Her manner was easy, unthreatening, like he might be with a skittish horse. The expression on her face was heartbreakingly tender. The two of them sat before the fire, and a warm, orange glow played over her gown, casting deep amber shadows beneath curves that he suddenly longed to touch, to trace, to cup in his hand.\n Marjorie sat in a grim, reeking kitchen, yet somehow she still managed to appear elegant. She still managed to be the most beautiful creature he\u0027d ever laid eyes on.\n Cormac shook his head. He needed to focus on the task at hand. Such foolish, boyish notions were not for him. He came for a reason: to question the other lads. Not to get swept away by base urges or by feelings that threatened to unman him.\n Still, he stepped toward her helplessly, eager to prolong the moment. He wanted to overhear the gentle words she\u0027d be speaking to the boy. He felt a stab of anguish, mourning the boy he\u0027d been.\n “So out with it,” she was telling the lad. “What did you discover at the docks?” Cormac\u0027s stomach fell. It wasn\u0027t the tenderhearted Ree caring for this alley rat\u0027s wounds; it was the brazen one. Charitable she might be, but he\u0027d never known the woman to step down from a challenge, and it was that woman who\u0027d be the death of him.\n He marched over to them. “I told you I\u0027d find the boy for you.”\n “Cormac.” She looked up with wide eyes.\n She was clearly unsettled to see him, and he felt oddly gratified. The woman could use a good dose of apprehension. She had entirely too much pluck. It was what had led to the fight at the docks. The memory recalled his surliness with a vengeance.\n “Westhall,” he said flady, looking around him, gathering his wits. “Not much of a manse, is it?”\n “It suits our needs.” She dabbed the boy\u0027s injury one last time. “That\u0027s all for you, Paddy.” The lad glanced nervously between them, lifting his chin at Cormac\u0027s answering glare. Damned if the gesture didn\u0027t put him in mind of Marjorie. Much to his aggravation, the boy looked to her for direction.\n “It\u0027s all right, sweet.” She patted his knee. “You can go. And thank you.” Her quiet smile for the boy made Cormac even angrier. “What are you about, sending mere lads to investigate for you at the docks?” he asked the moment the boy disappeared from the kitchen.\n “I did no such thing.” She stood, outraged. They were closer than he\u0027d realized, and she had to tilt her face up to hold his gaze. He felt the maddening urge to cup the back of her head.\n “Paddy went to the docks of his own accord,” she said sharply. “I was merely asking him what he\u0027d learned. You said yourself that I was right, that Davie is alive and out there somewhere.”\n “Aye, but I didn\u0027t mean you should be the one to chase him down. It\u0027s a man\u0027s job.” Her face was blank for a curious moment, and then Marjorie startled him by laughing. “You don\u0027t know me very well if you think I\u0027ll just sit by and wait for you to save Davie.” She was right. He\u0027d underestimated her. He had no idea whom she\u0027d become. He found he wanted to know.\n Instead, he only stepped closer. “That\u0027s exactly what I think.”\n Someone entered the kitchen, and she pitched her voice to a low, angry whisper. “Don\u0027t misunderstand me, Cormac.\n I appreciate your help. But if you won\u0027t let me be a true partner to you, then I will be forced to pursue this on my own as well.”\n Someone cleared their throat. “Pardon, mum?”\n “What?” she and Cormac snapped in unison, still staring daggers at each other.\n “Lord Murray was looking for you.”\n Cormac\u0027s eyes narrowed. “Who\u0027s Murray?”\n “Archie Murray.” She told him in a tight whisper. “A friend.”\n Archie. He recognized the name from the conversation he\u0027d overheard. It was the man who\u0027d supposedly sworn to help her. “Is that the fop who lets you lead him about by the nose? What does he want?”\n “Archie is no fop!”\n “Well who is he, then? Some pretty lordling? Can he protect you?” Cormac felt chagrin at the nobleman he\u0027d never be and shame at his inability to protect his own loved one so many years ago. The raw emotions made his words come sharp. “Answer me.”\n “He appreciates the work I do.”\n “You\n haven\u0027t answered the question.” Some foreign emotion burned through him, turning his blood to acid.\n Jealousy? he wondered distantly, and dismissed the thought at once. It was vexation he felt. That was all. Marjorie was a vexatious, exasperating, uncooperative, senseless woman. “Who in hell is he?”\n “He\u0027s training to be a physician surgeon,” she announced proudly. “He offers his help each week, tending to the physical ailments of the poor folk of Saint Machar.”\n “A student?” he scoffed. “And what? He\u0027ll throw books at the smugglers and dock men? You honestly think this Archie will be of help to you?”\n “Yes.”\n He turned to stalk out. “Then to the devil with both of you.”\n “The devil,” she called after him. “Why, Cormac, I\u0027d thought that was you.” Chapter 11\n “Archie!” Marjorie exclaimed, sweeping into her uncle\u0027s drawing room the following morning. The day was overcast, and watery light filtered in through the windows, but Archie\u0027s easy countenance perked up the dreary room.\n He came to her side, taking her hands eagerly in his. “Marjorie, my dear.”\n “Archie, what an unexpected surprise.” He was so tall and lean, and his long, thin hands were always so chilled.\n She paid mind to not letting her smile flag.\n Her maid bustled in close behind, bearing a tray of refreshments.\n “Ah!” Face brightening, he let Marjorie\u0027s hands slip from his. “Your lovely maid.” Marjorie could\u0027ve sworn she heard Fiona mutter, “Now there\u0027s a gentleman.” She frowned. Fiona was right. If only Cormac would show her a warm greeting once in a while. She surreptitiously scanned the room, but he was nowhere in sight.\n Good. She\u0027d seen him only once since their conflagration in the Westhall kitchen, and the silence between them had been deafening. He didn\u0027t want her help, and it goaded her. The man was brooding, and he was just as stubborn as he\u0027d ever been as a boy.\n Archie gravitated toward Fiona and the tray of food. “Shortbread. How delightful. There\u0027s nothing better than a bit of mid-morning sweet.”\n Fiona blushed.\n Marjorie wandered to the tray, eyeing it blindly. Could it be that Cormac wanted her to stay away because she\u0027d mucked things up so horribly in the past? With Aidan, and now again with Davie?\n She must\u0027ve made some inadvertent sound, because Archie turned to her as he swallowed his shortbread, concern clear on his face. “Marjorie, my dear. You must tell me how I can be of service.” She took in the sight of him. Upright, clean-shaven, well-dressed… the man practically glimmered with principle.\n Would that she could preoccupy herself with a man like Archie.\n Blasted Cormac.\n She harrumphed. Blast that she even thought about blasted Cormac.\n Well, she didn\u0027t give a tinker\u0027s curse about his censure. She\u0027d work to find Davie on her own. Still, it wouldn\u0027t hurt for him to see her efforts and successes. She pitched her voice a little louder, in case Cormac was within hearing range. Even though she hadn\u0027t seen him, she suspected he was lurking somewhere close at hand. “Oh, Archie, it\u0027s always so nice to see you.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-highlander-clan-macalpin-1/page-16.html","bookId":2656,"book":{"id":2656,"title":"Devil\u0027s Highlander (Clan MacAlpin #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Devil\u0027s Highlander (Clan MacAlpin #1) \n After Scotland\u0027s Civil Wars, the orphaned brothers and sisters of the MacAlpin clan reclaimed the abandoned Dunnochen Castle as their birthright.
