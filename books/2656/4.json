He\u0027d done horrible things.\\n\\n As if she\u0027d read his thoughts, she reached for him. The touch of Marjorie\u0027s hand on his arm was light, but it was as though lightning cracked, splitting his heart wide open. Her touch shattered him, exposing the pale, bleak creature hidden at his core.\\n\\n In that instant, he was vulnerable. Alone, and aching with yearning.\\n\\n He looked at her fingers wrapped around his forearm, and a lifetime of want burst to the fore. His eyes rose to find her gaze on him. He\u0027d loved her so. The sight of her reminded him of all he\u0027d lost. Of all he was missing.\\n\\n Cormac stiffened. He let his mind rove to a dangerous place, one where he eased Marjorie down to take her along the rocks, running his hands over her body, through her hair. She\u0027d let him; he saw it in her eyes. He could bury himself in her, forget it all. She\u0027d absolve him of his pain.\\n\\n His\\n\\n eyes clenched shut as he let that pain roil through him. He couldn\u0027t touch her. He wasn\u0027t the man she needed. He could never be good enough for one like Ree.\\n\\n Cormac pulled away, turning to heave a basket of fish higher up the shore. “Forget the boy, Marjorie.” He set his haul down with force, his eyes shut in a grimace. He\u0027d never used such a tone with her. He hadn\u0027t called her by her full name in he knew not how long. But he couldn\u0027t help that the world was a cruel place.\\n\\n “Marjorie!” his youngest sister shouted from up the beach. He told himself he was grateful for the interruption, that the pang in his chest was relief.\\n\\n Cormac busied himself with his nets. He heard a rustling as Bridget enthusiastically embraced her.\\n\\n “Marjorie,” Bridget exclaimed, breathless. “It is you! I never thought we\u0027d ever see you come calling. I sent you a letter just yesterday, planning my next visit to Aberdeen, but… Losh! Here you are. Are you well?” She added with feigned innocence, “Cormac was asking after you just last week.” He scowled, untangling and smoothing the twine webbing, even though the nets were already in impeccable shape.\\n\\n If he could, he\u0027d tan his sister\u0027s meddlesome hide.\\n\\n Bridget trilled merrily on. Cormac could hear from the laughter in her voice that she knew she\u0027d gotten under his skin. “Truly, Marjorie, it distresses me that it\u0027s taken you so long to visit. We\u0027ve lived here nine years!\\n\\n Imagine that. I do love the times I\u0027ve gotten to see you in Aberdeen, but, och, what a stranger you\u0027ve become.\\n\\n You\u0027ll stay for a time with us, of course.”\\n\\n Cormac winced. “She\u0027ll not want to bed down in our pile of rubble,” he said, not looking up from his work.\\n\\n “Cormac MacAlpin!” Bridget leaned down to swat his shoulder. “It\u0027s not so grim as all that. Come” — she linked arms with Marjorie — “and be welcome at Dunnottar Castle.”\\n\\n He rose slowly, meeting Marjorie\u0027s gaze. They locked eyes and, for a blessed instant, the rest of his world fell away. He lost himself, the past, his pain, drowned in vivid blue.\\n\\n She blinked, and\\n\\n something shifted in her gaze. Cormac swore he felt it shimmer like electricity across his skin. Marjorie narrowed her eyes, assuming a look, her look, the one she used to get before issuing one of her infamous dares. That glint aimed straight for him, and Cormac braced.\\n\\n Marjorie patted his sister\u0027s hand, her gaze never leaving his. Thank you, Bridget. I look forward to my stay.” Chapter 3\\n\\n “This was all from the wars?” Marjorie ogled a patch of severely damaged masonry. “Aren\u0027t you afraid the walls will tumble about your ears?”\\n\\n Bridget laughed. “It\u0027s not as though we were here when it happened. \u0027Twas a Covenanter siege that left the castle in a wee bit of disrepair.”\\n\\n “Wee bit?” she muttered, then shuffled to catch up to Bridget, who was leading her on a brisk tour of Dunnottar.\\n\\n “And you wonder why folk call you the Devil\u0027s Own!”\\n\\n Marjorie came to a breathless halt in the doorway of the dining hall. The sight of Cormac seated at the table scuttled her merriment. Intent on a mug of ale and some bread, he didn\u0027t look up. Why had she thought he\u0027d help find Davie, when he couldn\u0027t even bring himself to look at her?\\n\\n “Och, the villagers.” Bridget strode in and squatted before the hearth to stoke the fire to life. “Since Father died, they claim we\u0027ve been a pack of devils.”\\n\\n “It\u0027s Dunn\u0027s Devils,” Cormac muttered. “For Dunnottar. That\u0027s what they say.” Marjorie watched as he studiously dunked a heel of bread in his ale, just like he used to do when he was a boy.\\n\\n She fought a sudden smile and marveled at the foreign sensation. Since Davie\u0027d been taken, her pleasures had been rare. But Cormac, he\u0027d always made her smile. He used to tease them from her relentlessly, until she couldn\u0027t hold back.\\n\\n But that had been in the time before.\\n\\n The warmth that had been spreading through her chest clenched, leaving Marjorie sadder than ever.\\n\\n “Oh aye.” Bridget laughed. “A pack of Highland demons we are, for want of living parents.” Cormac remained focused on his bread. “Demons, just here in our wee slice of hell.” His sister shot him a hard look. “Dunnottar\u0027s been perfectly suitable since we patched the roof.”\\n\\n “It\u0027s as drafty as a boat on the open sea.”\\n\\n Marjorie felt his presence like a stitch in her side; she couldn\u0027t seem to breathe easily. She pulled her shoulders back\\n\\n to stand taller. “It certainly is… massive.” She looked around, taking in the gargantuan dining hall.\\n\\n “Aye, \u0027tis a great big sprawl of a place. There are stables, cellars for wine and beer, even barracks and a chapel… “ Bridget\u0027s voice grew distracted as\\n\\n she stabbed angrily at the stubborn embers. “It\u0027s housed armies, kings.” She straightened and hung the poker back in its spot by the fireplace. “Och, this cursed fire.”\\n\\n “And all these years, folk have simply let you… stay here? Nobody\u0027s tried to make you leave?”\\n\\n “I challenge anyone to try,” Bridget proclaimed. “In any case, it\u0027s been nigh on nine years now. They\u0027re not going to drag us out now.”\\n\\n Cormac slowly leaned back in his chair, and for the first time since they\u0027d stood together on the beach, he met Marjorie\u0027s eyes.\\n\\n The force of his gaze was a physical thing. She\u0027d had something she was about to say, but it froze on her tongue. She tried desperately but couldn\u0027t seem to make her mind produce words.\\n\\n “It was abandoned, after all.” Bridget\u0027s tone was breezy, and if she\u0027d noticed anything pass between Marjorie and her brother, she didn\u0027t let it show.\\n\\n Cormac cut his eyes down, the spell broken. “Abandoned? It\u0027s barely livable.”\\n\\n “Och, \u0027tis a fine place.” Bridget clapped the ash from her hands. “Folk know we\u0027ve no other home, and so they let us stay.”\\n\\n Cormac sneered. “Or they\u0027re afraid of us.”\\n\\n “Aye.” Bridget giggled. “That, too.” She turned to Marjorie, explaining only half-jokingly, “My brothers make a fearsome trio. You should\u0027ve seen them when we lost our cottage.” Marjorie pasted a smile on her face. Trio. Because the fourth went missing thirteen years ago. The thought didn\u0027t seem to occur to Bridget. So pretty and carefree, she\u0027d been only two years old when Aidan was taken.\\n\\n “You mean when you lost your tenancy?”\\n\\n “Aye, when Father was killed in battle.” Bridget sauntered to Cormac\u0027s chair, and Marjorie sensed him bristle.\\n\\n “Oh Marj,” she said, patting her brother\u0027s shoulder, “these lads were glorious. And so young, too — Gregor was sixteen at the time, and Declan only ten! But they looked out for me even then. I worried the laird would resort to burning our old, wee cottage down in his attempts to remove my brothers from it.”\\n\\n “I\u0027d always just assumed… “ She\u0027d always thought the MacAlpin siblings had simply made the odd choice to live there. It\u0027d never struck her that they had no other recourse but to squat in an abandoned castle. “Have you no place to go then, no other family? Nowhere in all Scotland?”\\n\\n Bridget shrugged. “Gregor made inquiries, after Father\u0027s death. But no distant relatives popped from the heather to deed us any sort of ancestral home.”\\n\\n “Is Gregor here?” Marjorie brightened. Gregor was the eldest MacAlpin son, and he was a hard man not to like.\\n\\n “Why would he not be?” Bridget asked.\\n\\n “Oh, I suppose… “ Marjorie furrowed her brow. “I just assumed he was living in Aberdeen now.”\\n\\n “Gregor doesn\u0027t live in Aberdeen,” Bridget said, as though Marjorie had just asserted that the sky was green.\\n\\n “Well, sometimes he travels to Aberdeen, but he certainly doesn\u0027t live there.”\\n\\n “Oh, I\u0027m mistaken, of course.” Though she would\u0027ve sworn she\u0027d heard rumors that Gregor kept a home near Broadgate.\\n\\n “Aye, and Declan\u0027s about, too.” Bridget shot one last look of disgust at the fire and strode toward the door.\\n\\n “Come, we\u0027ll finish our tour, and perhaps we\u0027ll run into them.”\\n\\n Marjorie stole a glance at Cormac. He was staring into his empty ale mug, his face blank. A dull ache crept across her chest, until breathing became a conscious effort. She nodded a mute good-bye, which he didn\u0027t acknowledge.\\n\\n How would she ever get him to help her? She was as alone as she\u0027d ever been. Was she deluding herself to think he\u0027d ever come to her aid? She\u0027d written her fate, a silly fool of a girl, with a dare thirteen years ago.\\n\\n Marjorie left the room with a heavy heart but quickly came back to herself when she realized she\u0027d lost sight of Bridget. Looking left and right, she spotted her down the hall, already bustling up a spiral staircase. Marjorie jogged after her, struggling to catch up while keeping a careful eye on her feet so as not to slip on the treacherously narrow stone steps.\\n\\n “It\u0027s for the better, you know,” Bridget said when Marjorie reached her. “Dunnottar is more spacious. Though I know as well as any that it\u0027s a mite threadbare… “ \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-highlander-clan-macalpin-1/page-4.html","bookId":2656,"book":{"id":2656,"title":"Devil\u0027s Highlander (Clan MacAlpin #1)","description":"Storyline: Devil\u0027s Highlander (Clan MacAlpin #1) \\n After Scotland\u0027s Civil Wars, the orphaned brothers and sisters of the MacAlpin clan reclaimed the abandoned Dunnochen Castle as their birthright.
