It\u0027d been just the two of them for some time, and she knew that, after supper, her uncle would be found in one place, and one place only. Marjorie walked in and headed straight for the library, Cormac stalking silently at her heels. Though the room had high ceilings, its dark paneled wood and rows of leather-bound tomes made it feel smaller than it actually was. There were only a few candles and a fireplace, and warm light danced and flickered, cutting swaths of orange through the thick black shadows. “Uncle!” she cried as she entered. Humphrey bent over a book, his reading glass in hand, mouthing silently to himself. His hair was a fine, fuzzy halo of white atop his head. Her uncle was getting on in years, and the sight of him gave her a pang. “Uncle?” she said again, walking to him with outstretched hands. Humphrey looked up, a finger marking his place in his book. It took a moment for his eyes to come into focus, but after a moment\u0027s perplexed goggling, the man smiled broadly. A splotch of ink stained his cheek with an indigo-black oval. “Marjorie, dearest.” A clock chimed the late hour, and her brow furrowed, part of her aware of Cormac looming uneasily in the shadows. “Shouldn\u0027t you be abed? It\u0027s so late, and you know sitting for too long in your chair is no good for your gout.” “Aye, I\u0027m going, I\u0027m going. But I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ve misplaced my Botanicals again.” He rifled through his cluttered desktop, moving piles on top of piles. “Do you know where volume four is?” Shaking her head, she shot Cormac a wry smile and walked to the far corner of the library. She stepped on a small stool, reaching for a thin sheaf of papers bound by a leather cord. “It\u0027s between volumes three and five, as it always is.” “Oh Marjorie, dear, what would I do without you?” Humphrey beamed, taking the manuscript from her. He gently untied the cord, his face softening with relief. “But whatever brings you here at this hour? You can\u0027t simply have sensed that I needed your assistance.” “You know how I cannot stay away from you, sir,” she jested. She plopped on the edge of his desk and began to straighten his piles. “I\u0027ve just now returned. And I wanted you to know I\u0027d arrived back safely.” “But… back from where?” The old man bore a look of good-natured bewilderment. “You were away?” Cormac saw Marjorie\u0027s shoulders slump just the slightest bit, and anger washed over him. Could her uncle truly not even have noticed that she\u0027d been absent from the house? “Yes, Uncle. I\u0027ve been away. Visiting the MacAlpins. But Gregor told me he sent word. Did you not get his message?” Marjorie unearthed a small envelope from one of his stacks. “Och, girl,” — Humphrey took the letter from her hand — “you know I can\u0027t find a thing without you. But where did you say you were?” He glanced at Cormac, seeming to see him for the first time. “You visited a gentleman?” “No. Well… yes. I suppose. But not like that.” She stopped fiddling with his papers to look her uncle in the eye. “Not a gentleman. Just Cormac.” Not a gentleman. Cormac frowned. He didn\u0027t know whether to view it as a compliment or an insult. “Cormac MacAlpin?” He leaned forward, his eyes narrowing. “Truly?” Cormac gave a brusque but respectful nod. “Lord Keith.” “Come here, lad. Step into the light.” Humphrey cleared his throat roughly and pulled a handkerchief from his pocket to cough into. Stepping closer to the firelight, Cormac could see that the years hadn\u0027t been entirely kind to the old man. He was thicker at the waist than was healthy, and Cormac wondered how often he left his desk. He supposed he should make polite chatter, asking about Humphrey\u0027s never-ending scholarly investigations, but the sight of him so aged stuck in Cormac\u0027s craw. What would Marjorie do after her uncle\u0027s death? The man hadn\u0027t even known she\u0027d been gone. Was there anyone who looked out for her? “But it is you.” Humphrey adjusted his glasses. “A man grown now! And with the look of your father, I daresay. And yet nothing like the man, I\u0027m sure,” he added quickly. Cormac didn\u0027t care to think what he\u0027d meant by that last statement. “Aye, and as a man grown, I couldn\u0027t allow Marjorie to make the long ride home by herself.” What he wanted to add was, “Unlike you, who let her embark on a day\u0027s journey, alone.” But then Cormac gritted his teeth, ashamed that, were it not for his family, he\u0027d have allowed that very thing. “Hm.” Humphrey absentmindedly rubbed the crown of his head, his joviality momentarily faded. There was a slight tremor in the man\u0027s gestures, in the pursing of his lips and the wavering of his hand, making him seem frail, despite his weight. “Well, I insist you stay.” “I\u0027m afraid I cannot—” “Of course he\u0027ll stay.” Marjorie was at his side, her hand on his arm. Her touch scorched him, and Cormac forced himself not to flinch away. “Angus will show you a room,” Humphrey said, nodding at a wizened footman hovering just outside the door. “Oh, good evening, Angus,” Marjorie said warmly. Cormac also nodded a greeting. Angus had been in her uncle\u0027s employ for as long as he could remember. But he was losing focus. He\u0027d seen Marjorie safely home, and it was time for him to find a room elsewhere. “Really, Humphrey, I canna—” “Cormac MacAlpin.” Marjorie\u0027s grip cut into his arm, startling him to silence. “You have ridden all day, and now you will rest.” He glanced down, taking in her profile. Her jaw was set, and her vivid blue eyes glittered in the ambient light. She was thinking of his comfort. And yet there was no one in the world who seemed to be doing the same for her. He didn\u0027t know why he was fighting the invitation. He\u0027d be just as happy to be spared the hassle of finding a room at this late hour. There was nothing improper about taking Humphrey up on his hospitality. Cormac decided to let himself get swept along in Marjorie\u0027s undertow. Just this once. He kept his mouth shut, and amid bids for good nights, let her tug him from the room. It wasn\u0027t until later, by the fire, that he regretted his decision. Regretted it deeply. His eyes burned from staring at the flames, and yet naught could dispel the memories that played over and over in his mind. Him and Ree racing through the house at a game of lummelen. Challenging her at draughts, at chess. She\u0027d clap and squeal when she won, and Cormac never begrudged her — he\u0027d loved the triumphant flush of her cheeks too much. How many hours had he, Marjorie, and Aidan spent playing rounds of hid? They\u0027d each try to top the other, finding increasingly obscure hiding places. Places like the buttery, her mother\u0027s wardrobe, the privy. The chimney. He stared at the hearth, remembering a pile of cold ashes. An upturned grate. The screams of his brother. Clenching his eyes shut, Cormac dropped his head against the chair back. He\u0027d lost so much that day. His brother. His innocence. His joy. His Ree. “Cormac?” Marjorie\u0027s voice was muted, but he\u0027d become so attuned to her, she could probably whisper from far away, and he\u0027d still hear. He braced himself for the sight of her. Attuned indeed. He was painfully aware of her, and it wasn\u0027t a pleasant sensation. “Aye?” he asked, raising his head slowly. It was late, and the fire had burned low. Marjorie stood in the doorway, shrouded in darkness. Her hair was long and loose, and she\u0027d dressed for bed. Though she had a tartan shawl wrapped tightly around her, a white night rail billowed about her legs. The fabric was fine, and it clung to the slope of her thighs. He could pull her to stand before the fire. He could push the shawl from her shoulders. She\u0027d stare up at him with those mysterious eyes. The gown would be sheer. Cormac clenched his hand hard around his glass of brandy. Damned brandy. Whiskey was what a man really needed. What he wouldn\u0027t do for a bottle of whiskey and a good clout over the head. “I wanted to make certain… “ She hesitated, and then stepped into the room. Her bare feet were pale and delicate. “Of?” The word came out sounding gruff. He slugged back the rest of his drink, welcoming the burn in his throat. “Do you have all you need, then? Are you hungry?” she added in what struck him as a hopeful voice. Damn her hope. Damn him and her both. He cut his eyes back to the fire, away from the sight of her. “Not hungry, no.” “Can you not sleep?” Her voice was gentle. She stepped closer, and he smelled the fresh, floral scent of her bath. Shutting his eyes, he leaned his head back against the chair once more. He\u0027d never be able to sleep now. “Please, Marjorie. Go back to your room and do not fash yourself on my account.” She didn\u0027t leave, though. He could feel her. Her presence charged the air, like a coming storm. “Not once have I sat in this room and not thought of him,” she said. The rustle of her nightclothes told him she was sitting in the chair opposite him. The firelight would illuminate her. Would he be able to see the color of her skin beneath the white gown? Cormac couldn\u0027t help but open his eyes. She was watching him. Good Christ, but she was beautiful. Orange light warmed her skin. He dreamed of touching it, just a quick stroke with the backs of his fingers. She\u0027d be soft, like the petal of a flower. “Why do you do this to yourself, Cormac? Sit here like this?” “Nursing my demons.” He raised his emptied glass in a mock toast. He wanted to get up and refill his brandy, but his body betrayed him. He\u0027d stiffened the moment she walked in the room. “Go rest now.” She gently took the glass from his hand. “You said yourself, it\u0027s up at dawn to explore the docks.” He studied her, staring at him so unabashedly. Marjorie knew him well. Speaking of the task at hand was probably the only thing that could tear him from his reverie. “Aye, I\u0027ll be off to the quays at dawn.” Her eyes narrowed. “We\u0027ll be off at dawn.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-highlander-clan-macalpin-1/page-11.html","bookId":2656,"book":{"id":2656,"title":"Devil\u0027s Highlander (Clan MacAlpin #1)","description":"Storyline: Devil\u0027s Highlander (Clan MacAlpin #1) After Scotland\u0027s Civil Wars, the orphaned brothers and sisters of the MacAlpin clan reclaimed the abandoned Dunnochen Castle as their birthright.
