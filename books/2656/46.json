What a strange and unexpected mystery within a mystery. “I\u0027d like to see them, if I may.”\n “Who?” Archie finally looked at her. “The boys?”\n “Who else?” Impatient, she simply hiked her skirts and headed to the stairs.\n “They\u0027re upstairs, where they always are,” he said to her back. The sounds of Archie\u0027s and Fiona\u0027s hushed murmuring ushered her out of the room.\n The makeshift dormitory was a windowless room with a low, gabled ceiling. She stood at the doorway, letting her eyes adjust to the utter blackness. And though it took her a moment to make sense of the sleeping forms, the heavy breathing of over a dozen boys greeted her, even and peaceful.\n It was just as Archie had said: they were all asleep.\n She tiptoed in until she found Davie, a smaller figure in the corner. His cheek was crushed against his pillow, mouth open, his face serene. She stroked a finger along his forehead, sweeping the hair from his brow. Safe.\n Something that\u0027d been clenched in her chest loosened, and she breathed a relieved sigh.\n She stood, staring into the blackness. There were a couple of problems that remained. If Archie wasn\u0027t the kidnapper, who was? And why was Archie receiving money from the bailie?\n Careful not to wake the boys, Marjorie went back downstairs, worrying the questions in her mind. Fiona and Archie stood together before the library fire, and she had to clear her throat to get their attention. They sprang apart at the sight of her.\n Archie fiddled nervously with his cuffs. “Did you see them?”\n If she didn\u0027t have more pressing matters on her mind, she\u0027d have asked the two of them what was going on. But instead she said, “Safely tucked in for the night, as you said.”\n “I was telling Fiona. I implore you. It\u0027s not safe here.” Archie hesitated, looking from Marjorie to Fiona, unsure which woman he should address. “You must return home.”\n Annoyed with the whole situation, Marjorie turned her back on him and dropped unceremoniously into a chair.\n “First I have something to discuss with you, Archibald.”\n “But it\u0027s not safe. The bailie… “\n She meticulously folded her woolen wrapper. “Oh, I know about you and the bailie.”\n “His is a dishonorable household,” Archie said fervendy. “You both must hurry back to your uncle\u0027s. The lads are safe with me.”\n He gave Fiona a tender look, and for Marjorie, that mawkish expression was the last straw.\n “I\u0027ve seen what safe means for you,” she said brusquely. She\u0027d grown tired of roundabout men who told her what to do, with no explanation for it. She\u0027d state the situation plainly, if nobody else would. “I saw you receive money, when I was at the bailie\u0027s home. Is taking money in exchange for children what you\u0027d call safe?” Archie\u0027s eyes flew to her. “Losh, no, Marj! I\u0027d never do such a thing.”\n “Then how do you explain the fact that I saw you skulking about the bailie\u0027s back rooms, taking payment from his manservant, not long after Davie\u0027s disappearance?”\n He sputtered for words, and just when Marjorie thought she\u0027d trapped him, he surprised her with an entirely different excuse. “The money… that wasn\u0027t from the bailie. It was payment from his wife. I made Adele a tonic.\n Against pregnancy.”\n His gaze swept to Fiona, as though the maid\u0027s recognition of his innocence were paramount. “I\u0027ve long suspected the bailie of nefarious doings,” he insisted. “Their lifestyle exceeds what would be expected of an officer of Aberdeen. I slowly ingratiated myself to him, watching and waiting all the while.” He pulled his shoulders back.\n “When Davie was taken, the time had come to act, and act boldly.” Fiona puffed with pride.\n “You had suspicions, too?” Marjorie sat forward on her chair. “But why didn\u0027t you simply tell me?”\n “I tried. That day at Humphrey\u0027s. But your Cormac was—”\n “Once and for all,” Marjorie snapped, “he\u0027s not my Cormac.”\n Archie\u0027s eyes widened. “Be that as it may, Cormac struck me as… how shall I put it… arrogant about the matter. I assumed you were safe in his care.”\n “I\u0027m in no man\u0027s care.”\n Fiona grunted as though she knew better, sharing a little eye roll with Archie.\n Marjorie popped up from the chair. She had to turn her back from the sight of them cutting doe eyes at each other. “So how do we stop the bailie?”\n “I must stay here all night,” Archie said with great bravado. “I\u0027ve heard the Oliphant leaves at dawn. I\u0027ll guard the boys until then.”\n Though Marjorie knew his gesture was brave and true, his earnestness nettled her. Cormac flashed into her mind, and she scowled. She\u0027d seen bravery, and it didn\u0027t sit perched on a leather armchair, behind a locked door, bearing a snifter of brandy.\n “I\u0027ll stay with you.” Fiona couldn\u0027t say the words quickly enough.\n “Then you and I shall keep watch,” he said grandly.\n Marjorie looked from Archie to Fiona. The attraction was plain between them, but she wondered about their difference in class. Though Archie didn\u0027t come from great wealth, he was studying to be a physician, and some would find his choice of a maid shocking. If they were discreet, Marjorie supposed Fiona\u0027s looks were enough to elevate her above her station. Indeed, her maid was ripe and lovely, and clearly there was something about her that made Archie feel like the man he struggled to be.\n Marjorie looked down at her feet. She recognized love when she saw it. It made her feel empty and alone.\n “Will you be safe?” Fiona asked her.\n “I\u0027ll rush back to Humphrey\u0027s straightaway. I\u0027ll lock myself in as I\u0027d promised and wait for Cormac.” Marjorie managed a smile. “You\u0027ve the right of it, Arch. Cormac will help me.” The lies spilled easily enough from her mouth. She knew what she had to do, and it wasn\u0027t cowering in her bedroom. She may not have the skills to sink the Oliphant. But there were men imprisoned on board, men who\u0027d set sail at dawn, to spend the rest of their days toiling on a plantation far from home. She\u0027d get on that boat, somehow. She\u0027d free them.\n Humphrey\u0027s house was pitch-black when Cormac returned. He took the back stairs two at a time — he couldn\u0027t see her soon enough.\n It\u0027d been wrong not to tell her the truth. He\u0027d tell her about Aidan. He vowed it was the last secret he\u0027d ever keep from her.\n Together they\u0027d find a solution. Together they\u0027d convince Aidan, and then Cormac would save the men. There was no other way; he saw that now. They belonged as a pair. Everything felt wrong when they were apart.\n He burst through her door, but the bedroom was empty. Baffled, he ran his hands over the sheets as though he might somehow find her hiding there.\n He heard a scuffling behind him, and spun. But instead of Marjorie standing there, it was the wee scullion girl.\n His heart fell.\n “Where is she?” he asked, and his voice came out as an accusation.\n “She went with Fiona.” The girl spoke quietly, and Cormac had to tilt his head to hear. “They raced off.”\n “Where?” He forced his voice to evenness. It\u0027d do no good to terrify his only source of information.\n “I heard… mayhap there was talk of a man, and a ship,” she said, not taking her eyes from her feet.\n Cormac\u0027s heart stuck in his throat. Could Marjorie have gone to the ship without him?\n She could, and she would. She\u0027d been furious with him and apparently feeling more betrayed than he\u0027d ever have imagined.\n How had he let it come to this? He needed to find her, tell her the truth, and make her his. If she didn\u0027t believe he loved her, he\u0027d show her.\n Cormac raced back into the night. He\u0027d destroy that ship, even if it destroyed him in the process.\n Chapter 35\n Marjorie couldn\u0027t just sit by and watch as a dozen or more of her countrymen were snatched from their families and displaced to a foreign shore where they\u0027d spend the rest of their lives toiling for some plantation owner.\n Granted, she wasn\u0027t quite sure how, precisely, she\u0027d go about saving them, but she told herself she\u0027d figure it out as she went. And sure enough, though she\u0027d wondered how she was to magically alight on the deck of the Oliphant, the rope ladder was down and waiting when she arrived. “Well, thank you, Jack,” she said under her breath.\n It meant someone had arrived before her. The bailie perhaps? She stood completely still, struggling to listen, but the only sound from above was the natural creak and groan of the ship\u0027s timber. Whoever the visitor was, they\u0027d gone below.\n But surely somebody was on deck. She scanned the railing, knowing there must be at least one sailor on watch. It took a few minutes\u0027 wait, but finally she saw him, a tallish figure sauntering toward the rear of the ship. She opened her ears, waiting for the sound of distant chatter, but there was only silence. She\u0027d just have to hope he was the only man on deck.\n Though the ladder swayed in the darkness, Marjorie managed to clamber on, and more easily this time. She\u0027d learned the hard way it was best to focus only on the cut of the raw rope in her palms, rather than dwelling on the water that slapped and churned below, now an eerie gun-metal gray in the moonlight.\n Hoisting herself over the railing was another matter entirely, though, and she was grateful none saw her shimmying and kicking over. She made it, and sat on deck for a moment with her skirts in a tangle at her knees.\n Scooting her back against the railing, she ducked into the shadows to scan for sailors while she caught her breath.\n The man she\u0027d spied was now leaning over the aft rail. Even if she squinted, all she could make out were the white stripes of his shirt in the night. She assured herself that, if she remained quiet, he wouldn\u0027t spot her either.\n She looked to her right and clapped a hand over her mouth in shock. The little moorish boy from before stood there, silent as a wraith. She drew in several unsteady breaths, waiting for her heart to stop thudding in her chest. “You frightened me,” she said in a barely audible whisper. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-highlander-clan-macalpin-1/page-46.html","bookId":2656,"book":{"id":2656,"title":"Devil\u0027s Highlander (Clan MacAlpin #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Devil\u0027s Highlander (Clan MacAlpin #1) \n After Scotland\u0027s Civil Wars, the orphaned brothers and sisters of the MacAlpin clan reclaimed the abandoned Dunnochen Castle as their birthright.
