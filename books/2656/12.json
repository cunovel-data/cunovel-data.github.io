Tired to his bones in a way that had naught to do with any physical exertion. He refused to let her go with him in the morning, but he\u0027d not fight that particular battle with her just then.\n “Ree.” He let himself say her nickname, low and intimate, and it felt illicit on his tongue. Apparently there were a few things he was incapable of fighting that night.\n “Cormac.” She watched him expectantly, her chin jutted high, and it reminded him of the girl he\u0027d adored. But there was nothing girlish about the way her shawl slipped further from her shoulders.\n He couldn\u0027t stop his eyes from grazing down. With the firelight behind her, Marjorie\u0027s legs were outlined clearly through her gown, nude flesh beneath gossamer white. His groin tightened further. Clenching his teeth, he looked back at the fire. “Good night, then.”\n “Good night, Cormac,” she whispered softly and drifted from the room.\n He stared at the flames, listening to Marjorie\u0027s light tread on the stairs. He stared long after she\u0027d have gone to bed. Staring at the fire reminded him of who he was. Of his mistakes, of his sins. Of what he was incapable of having.\n Most importandy, staring at the fire kept him farther away from the temptation waiting upstairs. A beautiful woman, who\u0027d be a balm to his soul and a spur to his loins.\n A temptation he feared he was neither strong enough nor brave enough to withstand.\n Chapter 8\n “How does this… ? Fiona, do you know… ? How do you… ?” Marjorie wriggled, trying to hike Declan\u0027s breeches up over her hips. She finally just flopped onto the bed, scooching her bottom into the seat.\n The maid stepped back, looking disgruntled that her bed-making progress had been interrupted. “I wonder how much of a gentleman your Cormac is.”\n “Got it!” Ignoring her comment, Marjorie popped up and bounced on the balls of her feet. “Oh, Fiona, this is lovely. So freeing. Is this what it feels like to be a man, I wonder?” She marched a few steps in place, lifting her feet high off the ground. “All women should be allowed to wear trews.” The maid shook her head disapprovingly. “What kind of gentleman allows a woman to wear his trews? No gentleman, I say.”\n “Oh, pish. You\u0027re too young to be such a wet rag.” Marjorie wound her hair into a loose bun. “Besides, they\u0027re not Cormac\u0027s trews. They belong to his brother.”\n “But what sort of gentleman encourages a lady in his care to stroll about town like a common… commoner? \u0027Tisn\u0027t seemly.”\n Marjorie\u0027s hands froze over her head. Fiona had been her maid since they were young girls, and so she allowed many liberties. But this was approaching the line. “It isn\u0027t town,” she said warily. “Just down to the docks. And Cormac\u0027s not encouraging me.”\n “What business do you have down at the docks that you need to dress as a boy? And… wait.” Fiona aggressively plumped a pillow. “Does Cormac even know what you\u0027re about?”\n “Well, he\u0027s going to the docks, and I\u0027d like to go with him. But if he says no, he can\u0027t stop me from following.”\n She heard Fiona gasp, and Marjorie sighed. She shouldn\u0027t be telling her maid so much. “You don\u0027t need to know any more than that. It\u0027s a private matter.” She switched her focus to tucking her hair beneath a man\u0027s tartan bonnet. “There!”\n “Not my business, she says.” Behind her, Fiona snapped the bed cover, an indication of her pique. “It\u0027s unsafe.\n What would your uncle say if he found out?”\n “Don\u0027t be silly. I\u0027ll be completely safe.” Marjorie put her hands on her hips, studying her front and sides in the mirror. She\u0027d bound her breasts as best she could — it wasn\u0027t perfect, but the man\u0027s shirt and vest did a good job concealing her form. “I think I\u0027ll pass. What do you think? Do I pass for a lad?” Fiona made a choking noise. And then, realization washing over her face, she asked slyly, “Is this about that boy who went missing?”\n “I\u0027ll just have to imagine that\u0027s your assent.” Marjorie strode to the door, feeling lighter, unencumbered…\n free. Halfway out, she paused, turned. “And Fiona. I\u0027ll have you know, Cormac is every bit the gentleman.” She descended the stairs with a smile on her face. Dawn was just beginning to warm the sky, and she felt her way down, navigating the old steps through the gray half-light.\n Reaching the landing, she stopped to adjust her outfit. She\u0027d never thought herself overly curvy before, but the boxy trews were intended for someone with the silhouette of a tree. She plucked at the seat. The feel of such sturdy fabric between her legs was strange and uncomfortable, almost a transgression. Wiggling, she tugged them down, pulling them as low on her hips as she reasonably could.\n The movement loosened the strips of woolen cloth she\u0027d used to bind her breasts, and they tickled, making her senselessly itchy. She swayed a bit, jiggling her torso, tiying to chafe the fabric along her skin. She felt a breast begin to slip free.\n “Criminy.” She smoothed her hands up her sides and along her breasts, trying to settle herself back in place.\n She frowned at the results. She\u0027d never make it to the docks if she needed to stop every five minutes to readjust.\n The sound of metal scraping on stone came from above. She looked up, startled. Cormac stood there, staring daggers down at her. He\u0027d fastened a sword at his waist, and it rasped along the narrow stairway.\n “You startled me,” she said, a hand still clutched at her breast. “Losh, Cormac, where did you get that sword?”\n “Where did you get those clothes?” Anger was plain in the set of his jaw, and waves of power rolled from him, as if he\u0027d summoned some dark force to him, all vigor and strength.\n A frisson of excitement shivered through her.\n “I borrowed them from Declan.” The statement was met with grim silence. “Your brother? Remember?”\n “Would that I could forget,” he grumbled.\n Sensing a disagreement, she straightened her back, gathering her wits. Davie needed her, and she\u0027d not fail him now. “I told you. I\u0027m coming with you. I\u0027m readying for the quays.”\n “And I told you, you\u0027re not.” Every muscle in his body seemed to be flexed taut. Ready.\n The thought flashed to her that she\u0027d chosen the exact right person to help her. She\u0027d woken nervous of the prospect of trolling the docks. But this man would protect her. He\u0027d know how to handle any trouble that might come their way.\n “Then I\u0027ll simply follow behind.” The clock was ticking — they needed to find Davie fast, before whatever ship held him sailed away, if it hadn\u0027t already. The thought sent black spots across her vision. She turned and strode to the door, lest her knees buckle beneath her. “Two pairs of eyes are better than one. Davie is my lad to look after, and look after him I shall.”\n “You\u0027re staying,” Cormac snarled.\n She stopped in her tracks. “No, I am not.”\n “I\u0027ll be damned if any harm comes to you. How am I to sniff around the docks while keeping an eye out for your safety?”\n “I don\u0027t need a nursemaid, Cormac.” Setting her shoulders down and back, she spun to face him. “I will absolutely not stay here whilst you gad about the docks in search of a boy you wouldn\u0027t even recognize.”\n “You… you… “\n She stared. “I what?”\n “Och, woman, you try me. Listen to reason for once, would you? You need to be safe.”\n “You\u0027re the one with the great, big sword,” she said with mock innocence. “Won\u0027t I be safer with you?”\n “Aidan wasn\u0027t safer with me.” The retort cracked rapidly from his mouth but then hung frozen in the air.\n As sharp as any blade, his words gutted her. It came down to Aidan. Always Aidan.\n Blame. Distrust. This was what it was all about. Marjorie had failed the boys so many years ago. Cormac feared she\u0027d fail him once more.\n “But—”\n “Enough,” he barked, cutting her off before she could speak. He hissed an exhalation, considering her. “I suspect I could tie you to a chair, and you\u0027d still find a way to follow me to the docks.” Cormac could blame her all he wanted, but Davie was her responsibility. Davie was all that mattered. “I suspect I would.”\n “Fine.”\n “Fine,” she repeated, giving him a triumphant nod. She turned to the door and was stopped by his hand on her shoulder. The heat of his touch imprinted upon her.\n Cormac flinched away as though burned. “You may come. But you will not go dressed… like… that.”\n “Dressed like what?” She put her hands on her hips. The gesture had the unfortunate effect of straining the buttons along the front of her vest. Marjorie kept her voice steady, despite the furious blush she felt suffuse her entire face. “I\u0027m pretending to be a boy.”\n His eyes flicked to her chest for the barest moment. “If you pass for a boy, I\u0027m the king of England.”\n “This is my disguise, and I think it a very clever one.”\n “Clever?” His eyes went to her legs, and his whole body seemed to stiffen. “You can see… “ The feel of his eyes roving over her so boldly made her insides go weak. “See what?” she asked, her voice grown unintentionally husky.\n Does he like what he sees?\n “Your… legs. One can imagine… “\n She became overly conscious of the trews. She\u0027d felt so free before, but all she felt now was the fabric hugging tight between her thighs. “Imagine what?”\n “One can imagine a lass getting her own self taken, wearing such a thing,” he said, his voice finally finding its strength. “I\u0027d never dreamed… “\n “It\u0027s a disguise.” Marjorie raised her chin high.\n “It\u0027s indiscreet.” He turned his back to her and seemed to be adjusting his sword belt. “Go and change.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-highlander-clan-macalpin-1/page-12.html","bookId":2656,"book":{"id":2656,"title":"Devil\u0027s Highlander (Clan MacAlpin #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Devil\u0027s Highlander (Clan MacAlpin #1) \n After Scotland\u0027s Civil Wars, the orphaned brothers and sisters of the MacAlpin clan reclaimed the abandoned Dunnochen Castle as their birthright.
