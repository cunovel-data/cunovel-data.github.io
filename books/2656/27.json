{"id":63995,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"The reel was transitioning into a strathspey, and the music slowed, drawing couples closer together, the dancers gradually organizing into pairs rather than groups of four or more. She and Cormac came together side by side. He brought his arm over her shoulder, taking her right hand in his right, and left in left. He stood so handsome and tall, held her so close, their real names forgotten amid this roomful of strangers, and it was a thing of magic. Marjorie imagined she could be this other person, could be simply a woman enjoying a dance with her husband. Her shoulders eased, savoring this brief respite from her worries, from her very reality. There on the dance floor, all thought about the night\u0027s goal faded from her mind. The music began, and slowly they walked forward, their steps taking them across the dance floor. The heat of his thigh blazed along her own until it rippled slow and sultry between her legs, leaving her feeling agitated, breathless. “Ease yourself, lass.” The edges of his profile caught the firelight — his strong jaw, the uneven line of his nose — and his bearing struck her as especially powerful in the shadows. And yet she saw an uncharacteristic lightness, too, playing in his eyes. She managed a nod, pretending to concentrate on the dance. He gave her hands a squeeze, and the heat between her legs spread to her belly, melting her from within. The floor was filled with couples, but for her, Cormac was the only other person in the room. “You\u0027ll want to breathe, aye?” Her eyes narrowed at the humor in his voice. “It\u0027s merely the cut of my gown that restricts my breath so.” “Ah, is that the only matter, then?” The dancers began to pivot, and just as she wondered how her stunned body might manage to shift positions, he spun her, his movements sure and confident but gentle, too. The only matter? Not nearly, she thought, trying for a deeper breath. “I had no idea you knew how to… “ Her voice tapered off, thinking about all the things she had no idea about. She thought she\u0027d known Cormac, until she\u0027d experienced his skillful kisses, his confident dancing. Had he been doing more than waging war in their years apart? Jealousy dumped into her veins like sour milk. “No idea how to dance?” Cormac pulled her tightly to him. The tempo shifted, and couples came together, chest to chest, to waltz about the room. “We danced as children, do you not recall?” He held her close, closer than was proper, and though her cheeks blazed red, she couldn\u0027t bring herself to push him away. “I remember,” she said, recalling the many playful reels danced at the adults\u0027 heels. It had never been like this, though. Not even close. Even when her little-girl thoughts of him had turned to imagined smiles and kisses, she had never felt this. “But… “ But had he danced with other women? Had he held others in his arms like this? “But… ?” he mused, crushing her chest closer to his. Cormac\u0027s hand glided from her waist to rest low on her back. If not for the layers of skirts, his fingers would be splaying just over the crest of her bottom. A peculiar urgency bloomed to life in her core, pushing thoughts of other women from her head. She knew better than anyone: the only mistress in Cormac\u0027s life was the sea. But, in this moment, his body was hard against hers, and for now that was all she\u0027d have a mind for. As he swung her about the room, her breasts chafed against him until she thought she\u0027d die from this feeling. This unspeakable, almost angry need for him simply to stop, for all the others simply to disappear, and for him to get on with doing everything his body threatened to do. He must\u0027ve felt it, too, for he managed to pull her even nearer, cradling his manhood against her. He looked down at her, his slate-blue eyes dark with lust, and she fought to stay on her feet in time to the music. “But it was never like this,” he said, giving voice to her thoughts. “I\u0027d always—” The strathspey ended, and the guests cheered to hear the band breaking into the jaunty opening bars of “Strip the Willow.” They were forced to part, and the moment her hand slid from his, Marjorie\u0027s chest felt hollowed. She faltered, stunned from the intensity of their last dance. Reluctantly, they joined the others to form two rows, a line of men facing a line of women. What had he been about to say? Always what? Her careening thoughts distracted her, and when their turn came to meet in the middle, linking arms to spin down between the lines of dancers, she was a beat behind. She skipped a step forward to catch up, and when Cormac laughed outright, the delight in his eyes disarmed her. When was the last time she\u0027d seen such easy pleasure on his face? The sight of it startled a carefree laugh from her. Always what? she mouthed when next she caught his eye. The corner of his mouth lifted in a smile, but there was darkness in his eyes. Her laugh stilled as that dark intensity wended its way straight to her belly. How did he manage it? How could a simple look from him stagger her so? Dancing with Cormac was by turns pure joy and utter disquiet, her body and heart experiencing such uncharted heights and wants. Their turn came again to twirl arm in arm down the center column, and as he spun her, she fought to maintain composure. “Always what, Cormac?” she managed breathlessly. “Always wondered… “ They approached the midpoint, and he slowed their steps, prolonging their contact. He canted his head down to hers. Instead of finishing his thought, the completion of an earlier conversation came out in a rush. “You\u0027d said you asked after me. Did you truly, Ree? Did you think of me, all these years?” Their hands parted as they reached the end, and they returned to their rows, their eyes locked as they took their places in the lines. He was asking for no less than a glimpse into her soul. It felt like a critical moment, a leap into the unknown, a moment to be reckless with her feelings or to tread with care. There was nothing to consider. Had she thought of him? She\u0027d done nothing but think of him. She nodded slowly, and a smile spread wide on his face. A truly unfettered smile from Cormac. She hadn\u0027t seen the sight in nigh on thirteen long years. She beamed back at him. The dance became a blur around them, and soon their turn came again. His strong arm linked with hers. The smile was gone from his face now, his tone fierce and low. “I thought of you, too, Ree. Asked after you, too.” Could it be? Could he care for her as she did for him? The mere thought made her tremble. All the couples paired off as the dance approached its finale. And as the music sped, Cormac braced her elbow with a firm hand, spinning her faster and faster till she thought her feet would leave the ground. He laughed aloud, and the exultation on his face made her heart soar. The music stopped abrupdy, and they fell into each other, their hearts pounding an erratic beat against their chests. He held her longer than was strictly appropriate, but the couples shifting and rearranging around them seemed oblivious to two lovers on the periphery. Reality slowly pierced Marjorie\u0027s consciousness, and she began to pull away, but Cormac gripped her arm, stilling her. His breath stirred her hair, and she felt warmed utterly from within. As she gradually caught her own breath, she realized Cormac stood frozen, his body seized, breathing measured, and every muscle tense and still as granite. “Cormac?” she whispered, unlinking her elbow from his to run her hand up his arm. He turned into her to hug her close, caressing his hand up the side of her torso. He stroked his thumb scandalously along the edge of her breast and shuddered in a breath, and she became aware of another aspect of his body grown terribly hard. “Oh… “ she gasped. She nestled closer, his manhood digging into her belly, and she felt wicked and free. “Oh.” “Come, Ree,” he told her, his voice husky. Their eyes met, his blue-gray gaze turned dangerously intense in the shadows. “Come with me.” Chapter 19 Marjorie looked up at Cormac, her heart skittering madly. She curled her fingers into the sleeve of his coat in an effort to steady herself. “Where are you taking me?” “Why, all this dancing is making you faint, aye?” He brushed an errant lock from her damp brow. Putting his hand over hers, he pulled her grip from his sleeve, twining her fingers with his. “It seems to me I need to take you to find yourself some sort of… salon in which to recover.” “Ohh. I see.” She bit back a smile. She put a dramatic hand to her chest. “Why yes. I think I am feeling a bit light-headed.” “Damn,” Cormac whispered, his features sharpening. “What is it?” Pressing his hand on her shoulder, he attempted to steer Marjorie to the left, but it was too late. A knot of dancers had parted to reveal the bailie. He\u0027d spotted them and, with a broad grin, was heading straight toward them. “Damn,” she repeated with gusto, and Cormac\u0027s startled laugh almost made the disappointment worth it. “Why if it isn\u0027t Lord and Lady Brodie!” Forbes extended his arms in a hearty greeting. “Welcome, welcome.” His gaze shifted from Cormac to Marjorie, a question in his eyes. She schooled her features, realizing she must look the picture of stunned outrage. “But is aught the matter?” he asked them. Marjorie deflated. Aught indeed. She\u0027d been about to get Cormac alone. She steeled herself. The bailie was the whole reason they were there. Never would they get a better opportunity to gather information, to find Davie. And, as much as it vexed her, she knew Cormac was the one to do it. She adopted what she hoped was the expression of a fainting flower. “I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m feeling light-headed.” She gave Cormac a pointed look, hoping he\u0027d understand her message: it was up to him now. “Perhaps I shall seek out the company of the other ladies?” “Ah, yes,” Forbes said, understanding her dilemma at once. “The fire blazes high, and what with all the dancers, women with such fine constitutions as your own are wont to need a rest.” It took an effort not to swat the bailie\u0027s arm and give him a dose of her fine constitution. She nodded weakly instead.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-highlander-clan-macalpin-1/page-27.html","bookId":2656,"book":{"id":2656,"title":"Devil\u0027s Highlander (Clan MacAlpin #1)","description":"Storyline: Devil\u0027s Highlander (Clan MacAlpin #1) After Scotland\u0027s Civil Wars, the orphaned brothers and sisters of the MacAlpin clan reclaimed the abandoned Dunnochen Castle as their birthright.
