He\u0027d have preferred wearing his plaid, but a pair of sturdy brown trews was less conspicuous dockside. The afternoon was gray, the sky wishing for rain but unable to muster more than a damp haze, and it was like walking through a cloud.\\n\\n A new boat had docked — a small, one-mast sloop — just next to the Oliphant. It bore investigating. For the plan he was considering, gaining proximity to the smugglers\u0027 ship would be key. If the sloop were used for fishing, mayhap its owner would be amenable to a bit of grease in his palms in exchange for turning a blind eye.\\n\\n Approaching, he struggled to read the name, painted dark crimson on even darker brown timber. The Journeyman. An odd name for a boat.\\n\\n Shrugging his chin deeper in the neck of his coat, he strolled closer.\\n\\n A man sat on the bow, his legs dangling over the edge. Cormac moved closer still, squinting through the mist, some vague intuition pricking the back of his mind.\\n\\n The stranger leaned back on his hands, swinging his feet in the air, his head canted lazily to the side. And then he rubbed his nose with the back of his hand.\\n\\n Cormac\u0027s knees buckled.\\n\\n His mind flashed to a boy. A boy who\u0027d wipe his face with the back of his hand till their mother\u0027s voice grew hoarse from her scolds. A boy who\u0027d sneak out with Cormac to talk until the wee hours. Cormac would stare at the stars above, but this boy couldn\u0027t sit still. He\u0027d sit on a rock, swinging his legs over the edge, ever moving.\\n\\n He\u0027d had hair the color of Cormac\u0027s but eyes all his own. And he\u0027d hated when he had to play the Campbell.\\n\\n Aidan.\\n\\n The stranger was Aidan. Cormac knew in that instant, as surely as he knew his own self. Aidan was alive, and he sat on the edge of a boat not twenty paces away.\\n\\n Alive. Cormac knew without a moment\u0027s doubt. He\u0027d know his twin anywhere. He needn\u0027t study his brother\u0027s features to recognize him, to know him.\\n\\n Cormac filled his lungs. He wanted to shout, to run to him, to leap and cry out.\\n\\n But then Aidan sat up and called to someone. Cormac strained to make sense of details through the fog and the bustle. There was a responding shout from the deck of the Oliphant. Jack appeared.\\n\\n Cormac held his breath, listening.\\n\\n The smuggler had a bandage wrapped around his head where Cormac had struck him. Jack nodded at Aidan, shouted back. They shared a laugh.\\n\\n Black wavered on the edges of Cormac\u0027s vision. What did Aidan have to do with a smuggler?\\n\\n He forced himself to draw breath. Turning on his heel, he walked back up the quay, staggering like a drunken man. Aidan had returned — but how and why? Was he indentured still, or did he return to Scotland as a slaver?\\n\\n Cormac didn\u0027t recall the walk back to Humphrey\u0027s. Instinct alone saved him from barreling up to the front door, desperate to go straight to Ree\u0027s arms. The world made no sense, but she, she made sense. All he wanted was to be near her, to get his bearings.\\n\\n His years of training kicked in, and as he approached Humphrey\u0027s street, caution and wile returned, as ingrained in him as his other five senses. Cutting down a back alley, he snatched an untended bucket of coal for an impromptu disguise, and snuck in a back entrance.\\n\\n Marjorie gasped as he stumbled into her room. “Cormac,” she cried, running to him and shutting the door behind him. “What happened?”\\n\\n How to explain? He stared at her, his mind reeling.\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t tell Ree what he\u0027d just seen. If she knew, she\u0027d only race down to the docks to confront Aidan for herself. His brother might be pleased to see them. But if he\u0027d become a smuggler, might he also flee in panic?\\n\\n Cormac had lost his twin once before; he couldn\u0027t risk losing him again.\\n\\n More than ever, this godforsaken world confused him. And more than ever, there was one thing he knew: family.\\n\\n It\u0027d been robbed from him at a young age, but he knew its value now.\\n\\n He had to find out the whole truth. He had to make sure. And until he did, he\u0027d protect his brother by keeping his existence a secret.\\n\\n He seized Marjorie\u0027s hands in his, and though she drew a sharp breath at the pressure, the grip she returned was just as firm. Marjorie was the only thing that made sense; Marjorie was the only thing that made his world real.\\n\\n Steadfast and true, she\u0027d been in his heart for as long as he could remember.\\n\\n He\u0027d make her his in truth. He\u0027d make her family.\\n\\n But first there was another truth he needed to discover and a secret he needed to guard, because would Marjorie still want him if it\u0027d been his brother — another devil MacAlpin — who\u0027d been responsible for stealing her beloved Davie?\\n\\n “Did you do it?” she whispered, brow furrowed with her intensity.\\n\\n “We can\u0027t, Ree. I\u0027ll not destroy the ship.”\\n\\n Chapter 32\\n\\n “What did you say?” Marjorie pulled her hands from his.\\n\\n “I said… Ree… “ Cormac raked a hand through his hair, fumbling for words.\\n\\n She tamped down a surge of angry impatience. Now was not the time for the man to return to his silent ways. “Do you mean, we\u0027re going to destroy the Oliphant in a different way?”\\n\\n “No,” he said, his voice flat. “We\u0027ll not be destroying anything.”\\n\\n “Help me understand, love.” Surely he didn\u0027t mean what he\u0027d just said. He\u0027d made her a promise. “Is it that you\u0027ve found a different way to save the men?”\\n\\n He shook his head mutely.\\n\\n “Just tell me what you mean. What are you planning to do?” Her heart began to pound in her ears. Cormac just stood there, grappling for words. She read the regret on his face, and it spoke volumes.\\n\\n The truth of it hit her: he wasn\u0027t going to do anything.\\n\\n “There are men still on board,” she said, incredulous. “Scotsmen, imprisoned. We\u0027ll save them, right? You must agree.”\\n\\n “I… I\u0027m sorry, Ree.” He reached for her hands.\\n\\n “Sorry?” She pulled away from him, feeling numb, unreal. “Are you saying you\u0027ll do nothing?”\\n\\n “Aye, Ree. I\u0027m sorry.”\\n\\n Frustrated, she shot him a look. “Stop saying sorry. Tell the men in shackles, Cormac. Tell the men imprisoned on that boat, who\u0027ll never see Scotland or their families again, tell them you\u0027re sorry.” He stood silently, buffeted by her angry words. It only piqued her anger more. That he didn\u0027t argue back meant he wasn\u0027t going to do anything to help.\\n\\n “I thought we were of the same mind,” she said, edging away.\\n\\n He stepped closer to her. “We are of the same mind.”\\n\\n “Then why?” She paced to the hearth, staring blindly at the fire burning in the grate. “Don\u0027t you have any explanation? More than no, Ree, sorry?” Her voice rose, anger, confusion, and betrayal all roiling inside her. He was completely closed off from her. “Has it become impossible? I\u0027d understand, Cormac, just give me a reason.”\\n\\n “I think… I think we should investigate further… “\\n\\n “Investigate? Investigate what? The Oliphant has a load of prisoners in her hull, their only crime that they\u0027re too poor to matter. They\u0027ll set sail any day. What more do you need to know? Just give me a reason why.”\\n\\n “I can\u0027t. I just… I no longer want to destroy it, Ree. That\u0027s all I can say.” He came up behind her, placing his hands on her shoulders.\\n\\n His touch was tentative, and she was too numb to move away. “You promised me,” she said bleakly. “I should\u0027ve done it myself. I\u0027ll need to do it myself.”\\n\\n “You\u0027ll do no such thing,” he said, outrage in his voice.\\n\\n She spun to face him, galled that he\u0027d use such a tone with her. “You can\u0027t order me about.”\\n\\n “I\u0027m sorry, Ree,” he said, and the look on his face was one of helpless anguish.\\n\\n Men. She was the one who was helpless, she the wronged one. Men were such inexplicably foreign animals. She\u0027d prick his male pride, she decided, and perhaps that would get at the truth. “I don\u0027t understand,” she said coldly.\\n\\n “Help me understand. Is it that you\u0027re unable to do it? Afraid, even?”\\n\\n “Of course I\u0027m able. It\u0027s just that… “ He hesitated, perhaps realizing he\u0027d just admitted he could help her if he wished.\\n\\n The breath whooshed out of her, as another answer occurred to her. “It\u0027s because you don\u0027t love me enough.”\\n\\n “That is not the reason,” he said vehemently. “Not nearly. I want us to be married.”\\n\\n “You want to marry me instead of destroying the slave ship?” She put her hands on her hips, trying to discern truth from invention. “Is that a marriage proposal?”\\n\\n “Aye, Ree, it is.” He opened his arms before him as though entreating her.\\n\\n She no longer knew what to believe. “Are you asking me to marry you because you feel guilty you won\u0027t do this for me? Or perhaps it\u0027s simply to divert my attention.”\\n\\n “Of course not,” he said quickly.\\n\\n He was acting guilty, and her stomach turned. “Do you speak of marriage because you feel guilty you\u0027ve taken my virginity? Is that it? Is this proposal merely your mislaid sense of duty?” The truth of things came to her in a rush of clarity. Cormac had never told her he loved her. She\u0027d been the one to speak the words. What he felt was simple attraction — his passion for her didn\u0027t extend from his body to his heart. He\u0027d surrendered to his passions, and now he acted merely from a sense of duty.\\n\\n Horror and embarrassment overwhelmed her. She was an obligation to be minded.\\n\\n She\u0027d fooled herself all this time — she\u0027d never be his. She could accept his proposal, make Cormac lawfully hers. Unutterable sadness filled her — she ached with it — because she knew she couldn\u0027t say yes. She\u0027d always dreamed of being Cormac\u0027s wife, but she had her pride. She needed to be the bride of his heart, not simply his bride in name. “No, Cormac. I cannot marry you.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-highlander-clan-macalpin-1/page-43.html","bookId":2656,"book":{"id":2656,"title":"Devil\u0027s Highlander (Clan MacAlpin #1)","description":"Storyline: Devil\u0027s Highlander (Clan MacAlpin #1) \\n After Scotland\u0027s Civil Wars, the orphaned brothers and sisters of the MacAlpin clan reclaimed the abandoned Dunnochen Castle as their birthright.
