He\u0027d need to better the odds, which meant splitting the captain off from the rest of his men. The captain\u0027s cabin would be aft. It\u0027d be a small cell, small enough to accommodate only a few sailors at a time, minimizing the number of men Cormac would have to face at once. He flexed his fingers, anticipation heightening his senses. Despite what he\u0027d told Ree about an aversion to confinement, he fought well in enclosed spaces. “To your cabin,” Cormac said and then realized he should temper himself so as not to arouse suspicion. A man in Lord Brodie\u0027s position — a wealthy noble dealing with smugglers, presumably for the first time — would express caution. He added, “You\u0027ll get the money when I\u0027m not feeling so exposed.” Nodding, the smuggler led them to a small cabin at the rear of the ship. As they crossed the deck, he studied Jack\u0027s back. Cormac was the taller man, but the captain wasn\u0027t exactly small. And the man had a sword, while Cormac had only his pistol. Which was a handy weapon indeed, if one had the time to load it, and time was something Cormac wouldn\u0027t have. He rubbed his fingers together, deep in thought. He\u0027d need to disarm Jack and muscle his way out. His elbow grazed the knob of wood and steel holstered at his side. A cold smile cocked the corner of his mouth. Pistols were capable of more than just firing bullets. He\u0027d have only one opportunity to act. Smugglers or no, ships like these were run with clocklike precision. Every moment he hesitated invited interruption. Cormac didn\u0027t hesitate. Jack entered the dim cell. It was just as he\u0027d imagined it: a narrow rectangle of a room featuring a bunk, a small table and bench, two portholes, and a lantern bearing an unlit candle. Cormac stepped in right behind him, and then stepped even closer still, until he could smell the man\u0027s sweat and feel the heat of his body radiate to his chest. Jack stopped, stiffened, began to turn. “What do you—” Cormac slammed his pistol down onto the captain\u0027s temple. Jack grunted, and Cormac caught him before he toppled noisily to the ground. Hugging the man awkwardly to him, he kicked the door shut behind them, shuffling Jack forward and dropping him onto his cot. He was back out the door at once, Jack\u0027s sword in his hand. Though he held the blade as low and as inconspicuously as possible, it was only a matter of time before some canny sailor recognized their captain\u0027s blade in this stranger\u0027s hand. A few sailors looked at him, and he held their eyes, giving them a brazenly confident nod. It was apparendy an attitude they were comfortable with, because nobody raised any alarm. He walked briskly to the side of the ship and had almost reached the ladder when he heard the old man\u0027s voice. “Ho!” Cormac picked up his pace, and the man shouted again, “You there!” He sensed the activity on deck come to a standstill. There was a loud thump behind him as a man jumped from the rigging, landing just behind his shoulder. Cormac sprinted to the edge of the ship, looking over the side for Marjorie. The boys had congregated at the head of the dock, and she stood alone, staring up at him. The anguish on her face broke something in him. He hated bringing her pain, and he\u0027d do his best to survive this. But if he didn\u0027t, he\u0027d know he\u0027d given his all, and all for her. His years of killing, of watching the killing, all would be redeemed today, on this ship. All his terrible knowledge, his talents, would finally be put to a good end. “Cormac,” she screamed. “Behind you!” He tossed the coin purse down to her. “Go!” She caught it, but then simply stood, paralyzed, on the quay. Panic seized him. “Run, now!” He hated leaving her alone. And then he remembered there was one person in Aberdeen, outside of her uncle\u0027s home and apart from her charity work, whom Marjorie could count on. “Run,” he shouted again. “To your maid, lass! Hide with your maid!” As he watched her eyes flicker bright with understanding, he heard a footfall behind him. Raising his sword, he spun, blocking a young sailor\u0027s blade with a sharp clang, stopping it just above his collarbone. Chapter 27 She raced up the quay, thoughts careening wildly in her head. She\u0027d done it again. She\u0027d made a dreadful decision, a deadly decision. A low keening sound escaped from her lips, and she bit it back. The boys were waiting for her at the head of the dock, terrified. She needed to be strong for them. Cormac would want her to be strong. A loud crack sounded at her back. She\u0027d never heard gunfire before, but the menace and the power of it was unmistakable. Her legs pumped faster. She reached them and, barely slowing her pace, snatched Davie\u0027s hand and another of the smaller boys. “Marjry,” Davie cried, his tiny fist damp in hers. She clutched it even harder, terrified he might slip from her grasp. “You\u0027re hurtin\u0027 me, Marjry.” She shushed him, and panic made her voice stern. “Run! We must run!” Run. It was the last thing Cormac had told her to do. Would those final words echo forever in her mind, haunting her? Go… run. This time she couldn\u0027t stop the short, sharp cry that tore from her throat. Cormac was the one who should\u0027ve run — from the sight of her. He\u0027d known it that day on the beach at Dunnottar. He\u0027d wanted nothing to do with her, but she\u0027d forced herself back into his life. He\u0027d been wary, skittish, as though only he had been able to see the clouds of tragedy looming over her shoulder, just on the horizon. Cormac. A sharp cramp in her side stole her breath. She embraced it and ran harder. What pain was Cormac enduring even now, for her? She\u0027d impetuously demanded all the boys. They hadn\u0027t discussed it before. She was sure he would\u0027ve done her bidding, had they only discussed it, planned for it. Instead, she\u0027d made the decision for them rashly, and it was costing Cormac his life. She could see no way out of his situation. She\u0027d gotten away with the boys and the money. All the fighting talent in the world wouldn\u0027t save him from a shipload of furious smugglers. He had no way out. She stopped, leaned over, a hand on her knees. Gasping for air, she clutched at her belly, feeling like she might be sick right there in the street. She felt a small hand stroking awkwardly at her hair. Davie. Wee Davie. She had to get him to safety. It wasn\u0027t about her now, nor Cormac. He\u0027d known that; it was why he\u0027d forsaken his life to save theirs. Convulsively swallowing back the bile in her throat, she looked up. The boys were staring at her expectantly, alarm and confusion furrowing their poor, filthy faces. She glanced around to get her bearings. The docks were far at their backs now, and in her panic, she\u0027d led them down a warren of side streets. She needed to gather her wits, or it\u0027d mean the death of all of them. Not wanting to invite too much attention, she forced herself to walk again. Fiona. Cormac\u0027s last intention had been that she find her maid, Fiona, and that was exactly what she would do. Pulling her shoulders back, she picked up her pace, but not so much as to raise suspicion. “Come now, boys.” One of the younger ones was crying silently. She gave a perfunctory pat to his head. “Steady on, lad. You\u0027re safe now,” she assured him, wishing she spoke the truth. She racked her mind, trying to get her bearings and recall where exactly Fiona lived. How could it be that the maid had been in their employ for over a decade, and yet Marjorie had never once been to her house? She scolded herself. All her talk of the importance of charitable living, and here she\u0027d never expressed enough of an interest in Fiona\u0027s life to pay her family a single visit. She remembered the lass had once told her of life in the vennel, a narrow lane off Huckster Row and one of the poorer spots in Aberdeen. Marjorie girded herself, hoping Fiona still lived there. Braving the vennel was bad enough; she prayed it wouldn\u0027t be in vain. They came to the head of the alley. Buildings hovered close together, casting the place in cold shadow. The boys edged away, outright panic on their faces. “Come on,” she urged, tugging at Davie\u0027s hand. One of the older boys came to a full stop, his arms crossed over his chest. “No, mum.” The pose reminded her of Cormac, and a needle of pure anguish pricked her chest. Marjorie pursed her lips. She had no time for boys\u0027 nonsense. They were in grave danger, and doubly so now that they were standing exposed and unprotected before who knew what manner of unsavory elements there were to be found in this neighborhood. “No, what?” “I\u0027ll not go there.” His face took on a look of utter indifference, as if he had something better to do, and Marjorie were merely the pest keeping him from it. “You listen to me.” Every ounce of fear and regret poured into her voice, sharpening her tone into something that\u0027d tame even the most headstrong of Saint Machar lads. “I\u0027m saving you, if you haven\u0027t noticed. You will do as I say, you little wretch, and right this instant. And what I\u0027m saying is that you will” — she let go Davie\u0027s hand to tweak the older boy\u0027s ear — “follow” — she stepped into the lane, dragging him close behind — “me.” Marjorie herded them along, feeling more alone than ever. The vennel matched her despairing mood. Dilapidated houses crammed the alley cheek by jowl, each shoddier than the last, all listing walls and windows stuffed with rags. But it was the silence that struck her the most. The place was silent and menacing, as though people skulked behind closed doors hiding and scheming. This was where the blushing Fiona lived? Marjorie shivered. It was a horrid place. She took in one appalling structure after another, wondering how she would ever find her. A few of the boys apparently felt more secure, though, because they split off from the group, scuffling and running along the lane, shouting threats at each other. Her face flushed hot with anger and fear. The boys were innocents who had no idea what they were dealing with.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-highlander-clan-macalpin-1/page-38.html","bookId":2656,"book":{"id":2656,"title":"Devil\u0027s Highlander (Clan MacAlpin #1)","description":"Storyline: Devil\u0027s Highlander (Clan MacAlpin #1) After Scotland\u0027s Civil Wars, the orphaned brothers and sisters of the MacAlpin clan reclaimed the abandoned Dunnochen Castle as their birthright.
