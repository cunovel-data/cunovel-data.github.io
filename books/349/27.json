{"id":44004,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER XXVII. LARRY DEANE.","content":"Not altogether in accordance with his inclinations, Walter was set to work at his studies immediately under the direction of Mr. Crabb. He asked his father for a week’s vacation to go about the city with Hector, but his father answered in the negative. “You are too far behind in your studies, Walter,” he said. “You are two years, at least, behind Hector, and cannot spare the time as well as he.” “Hector will have to go round alone,” objected Walter. “It will do him no harm to get acquainted with the different parts of the city, as that will be a kind of knowledge he may require if he should obtain a situation.” “I shan’t see much of him.” “Oh, yes, you will; Mr. Crabb will not make you study all day. Mr. Crabb, you may work with Walter from nine to one. This, with perhaps an hour or more devoted to study in the afternoon or evening, will enable him to make fair progress.” This arrangement struck Walter favorably, as he could, whenever he desired it, spend the whole afternoon with Hector. Hector found it very pleasant to act upon the suggestion made by Mr. Ross. He had visited the city of New York at different times, but had never enjoyed the opportunity of exploring it by himself. His first visit was made to Central Park, where he mingled with the crowds wandering about in search of pleasure. He made his way to the lake, and took passage in one of the skiffs which, in charge of a skilled oarsman, makes a tour of the pretty and picturesque sheet of water. The second morning he turned his steps southward, and walked down Broadway. It was a leisurely walk, for he had no scruple in stopping wherever he saw anything in the streets or in the shop windows that seemed to him worthy of attention. About the corner of Canal Street he was very much surprised at a boy who was on his knees, blacking the boots of an elderly gentleman—a boy whom he recognized at once as the son of a man who had for years been in his father’s employ as gardener at Castle Roscoe. “What brings him here?” thought Hector, much surprised. “Larry Deane!” he said, as the boy finished his job, and rose from his feet to receive his pay. “Hector Roscoe!” exclaimed Larry, not much less surprised. “What brings you here, and what has reduced you to such work?” inquired Hector. Larry Deane was a boy of about Hector’s age. He was a healthy-looking country lad, looking like many another farmer’s son, fresh from the country. He had not yet acquired that sharp, keen look which characterizes, in most cases, the New York boy who has spent all his life in the streets. “I can answer both your questions with the same word, Master Hector,” said Larry, as a sober look swept over his broad, honest face. “Don’t call me master, Larry. We are equals here. But what is that word?” “That word is trouble,’” answered the bootblack. “Come with me into this side street,” said Hector, leading the way into Howard Street. “You have a story to tell, and I want to hear it.” “Yes, I have a story to tell.” “I hope your father and mother are well,” said Hector, interrupting him. “Yes, they are well in health, but they are in trouble, as I told you.” “What is the trouble?” “It all comes of Mr. Allan Roscoe,” answered Larry, “and his son, Guy.” “Tell me all about it.” “I was walking in the fields one day,” said Larry, “when Guy came out and began to order me round, and call me a clodhopper and other unlikely names, which I didn’t enjoy. Finally he pulled off my hat, and when I put it back on my head, he pulled it off again. Finally I found the only way to do was to give him as good as he sent. So I pulled off his hat and threw it up in a tree. He became very angry, and ordered me to go up after it. I wouldn’t do it, but walked away. The next day my father was summoned to the house, where Mr. Allan Roscoe complained of me for insulting his son. He asked my father to thrash me, and when father refused, he discharged him from his employment. A day or two afterward a new gardener came to Roscoe Castle, and father understood that there was no chance of his being taken back.” “That was very mean in Mr. Roscoe,” said Hector, indignantly. “Yes, so it was; but father couldn’t do anything. He couldn’t get a new place, for it wasn’t the right time of year, and Mr. Roscoe said he wouldn’t give him a recommendation. Well, we had very little money in the house, for mother has been sick of late years, and all father’s extra earnings went to pay for medicines and the doctor’s bill. So one day I told father I would come to New York and see if I couldn’t find something to do.” “I think you did the right thing, Larry,” said Hector, approvingly. “It was your duty to help your father if you could.” “I can’t help him much,” answered Larry. “What made you take up this business, Larry?” “I couldn’t get anything else to do, besides, this pays better than working in a store or office.” “How—much can you earn at it?” “Six or seven dollars a week.” “I should think it would require all that to support you.” “It would if I went to a boarding house, but I can’t afford that.” “Where do you live?” “At the Newsboys’ Lodging House.” “How much does that cost you?” “For eighteen cents a day I get supper, lodging and breakfast. In the middle of the day I go to a cheap restaurant.” “Then you are able to save something?” “Yes; last week I sent home three dollars, the week before two dollars and a half.” “Why, that is doing famously. You are a good boy, Larry.” “Thank you, Hector; but, though it is doing very well for me, it isn’t as much as they need at home. Besides, I can’t keep it up, as, after a while, I shall need to buy some new clothes. If your father had been alive, my father would never have lost his place. Master Hector, won’t you use your influence with your uncle to have him taken back?” Hector felt keenly how powerless he was in the matter. He looked grave, as he answered: “Larry, you may be sure that I would do all in my power to have your father restored to the position from which he never should have been removed; but I fear I can do nothing.” “Won’t you write to Mr. Roscoe?” pleaded Larry, who, of course, did not understand why Hector was powerless. “Yes, I will write to him, but I am sorry to say that I have very little influence with Mr. Roscoe.” “That is strange,” said Larry; “and you the owner of the estate.” Hector did not care to explain to Larry just how matters stood, so he only said: “I can’t explain to you what seems strange to you, Larry, but I may be able to do so some time. I will certainly write to Mr. Roscoe, as you desire; but you must not build any hopes upon it. Meanwhile, will you accept this from me, and send it to your father?” As he spoke, he drew from his pocketbook a five-dollar bill and handed it to his humble friend. Larry would not have accepted it had he known that Hector was nearly as poor as himself, but, supposing him to be the heir of a large and rich estate, he felt no hesitation. “Thank you very much, Hector,” he said; “you had always a kind heart. This money will do my father very much good. I will send it to him to-day.” “Do you generally stand here, Larry?” asked Hector. “Yes.” “Then I will take pains to see you again.” “Shall you stay long in the city, Master Hector?” “Not Master Hector.” “Then Hector, if you don’t mind.” “I shall be here for the present—I don’t know how long.” “Then let me black your boots for nothing every time you come by—I want to do something for you.” “Thank you, Larry; but I don’t like to have a friend perform such a service. Remember me to your father when you write.” “I wish I could do something for Larry,” said Hector, to himself, as he walked away. “As it is, I stand in need of help myself.” He was to make a friend that day under rather unusual circumstances.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2974/81943.html","bookId":349,"book":{"id":349,"title":"Hector\u0027s Inheritance or The Boys of Smith Institute","description":"简介： Mr. Roscoe rang the bell, and, in answer, a servant entered the library, where he sat before a large and commodious desk....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2974","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:37 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:37 AM"}}
