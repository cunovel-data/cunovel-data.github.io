{"id":1538,"title":"The Sea Wolves (The Secret Journeys of Jack London #2)","description":"Storyline: The Sea Wolves (The Secret Journeys of Jack London #2) The world knows Jack London as a writer who lived his own real-life adventures. But there are some parts of his life that have remained hidden for many years, things even he couldn\u0027t set down in writing. Terrifying, mysterious, bizarre, and magical--these are the Secret Journeys of Jack London. Clinging to life after he is captured in an attack by savage pirates, Jack is unprepared for what he faces at the hands of the crew and their charismatic, murderous captain, Ghost. For these mariners are not mortal men but hungry beasts chasing gold and death across the North Pacific. Jack\u0027s only hope lies with Sabine--a sad, sultry captive of Ghost\u0027s insatiable hunger. But on these waters, nothing is as it seems, and Sabine may be hiding dangerous secrets of her own. The second installment in the adventures of the young Jack London is a masterpiece of tension and emotion. Christopher Golden and Tim Lebbon, along with illustrator Greg Ruth, have crafted a tale for readers of all ages, an action-packed, romantic, and suspenseful descent into the darkest desires of men and beasts and the hell that awaits them.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-sea-wolves-the-secret-journeys-of-jack-london-2.jpg","author":"Christopher Golden","type":"Adventure","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":32,"category":{"id":1,"name":"Adventure","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
