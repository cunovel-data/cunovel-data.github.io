Why go out, why expand so much more The storesare getting farther and farther away. After the seventeenth store, though, I realized there wasn\u0027t going tobe any stopping it.\"HELEN WALTONAs much as we must have looked like promoters in the early goingwith our donkey rides and ridingmowers out in the parking lots, and mountains of Tide, or whatever, piled up inside the storeswhatnobody realized, including a few of our own managers at the time, was that we were really trying from thebeginning to become the very best operatorsthe most professional managersthat we could. There\u0027s noquestion that I have the personality of a promoter. That personality, and our somewhat unorthodox styleat Wal-Mart, probably confused people at the outset. In fact, I have occasionally heard myself comparedto P. T. Barnum because of the way I love to get in front of a crowd and talk something upan idea, astore, a product, the whole companywhatever I happen to be focused on right then. But underneath thatpersonality, I have always had the soul of an operator, somebody who wants to make things work well,then better, then the best they possibly can. So I guess when folks saw me walking around scribblingnotes on my coffee-stained yellow legal pad, or hauling boxes of ladies\u0027 lingerie into the stores out of mystation wagon, maybe they didn\u0027t take me that seriously. They assumed we couldn\u0027t be in it for the longhaul. Some folks no doubt figured we were a little fly-by-nightyou know, in the discount business todaybut out selling cars or swampland tomorrow. I think that misunderstanding worked to our advantage for along time, and enabled Wal-Mart to fly under everybody\u0027s radar until we were too far along to catch. \\n\\n \\n\\n Truth be told, discounting attracted mostly promoters in the beginningpeople who had been in thedistribution center business or who were real estate promoters, guys who weren\u0027t really even aspiringmerchants but who saw a huge opportunity. You didn\u0027t have to be a genius to see discounting as a newtrend that was going to sweep the country, and all kinds of folks came jumping into it with all fourfeetwherever they could arrive firstCedar Rapids, Iowa, or Springfield, Missouri, it didn\u0027t matter. Theywould take a carbon copy of somebody\u0027s store in Connecticut or Boston, hire some buyers and somesupervisors who were supposed to know the business, and start opening up stores. From about 1958until around 1970, it was phenomenally successful. \\n\\n \\n\\n Anybody who has ever known anything about me knows I was never in anything for the short haul; Ialways wanted to build as fine a retailing organization as I could. But in those early daysbefore, and justafter, we opened the first Wal-MartI got to know a lot of those promoters. As I told you, I ran thecountry studying the discounting concept, visiting every store and company headquarters I could find. \\n\\n \\n\\n The first ones I saw were the mill stores in the East, where the whole thing started. Ann \u0026 Hope was inProvidence, Rhode Island, and there were others in Massachusetts and across New England. I went allover up there looking at Giant stores and Mammoth Mart and Arlan\u0027s. Another one I learned a lot fromwas Sol Price, a great operator who had started Fed-Mart out in southern California in 1955. I madefriends with Sol\u0027s son-in-law, who was running a distribution center in Houston, and talking with himhelped me sort out some of my thinking on distributionwhich would eventually become another key toWal-Mart\u0027s success. I guess I\u0027ve stolenI actually prefer the word \"borrowed\"as many ideas from SolPrice as from anybody else in the business. For example, it\u0027s true that Bob Bogle came up with the nameWal-Mart in the airplane that day, but the reason I went for it right away wasn\u0027t that the sign wascheaper. I really liked Sol\u0027s Fed-Mart name so I latched right on to Wal-Mart. I do not believe Kmartexisted at that time. \\n\\n \\n\\n I read in some trade publication not long ago that of the top 100 discounters who were in business in1976, 76 of them have disappeared. Many of these started with more capital and visibility than we did, inlarger cities with much greater opportunities. They were bright stars for a moment, and then they faded. Istarted thinking about what really brought them down, and why we kept going. It all boils down to nottaking care of their customers, not minding their stores, not having folks in their stores with goodattitudes, and that was because they never really even tried to take care of their own people. If you wantthe people in the stores to take care of the customers, you have to make sure you\u0027re taking care of thepeople in the stores. That\u0027s the most important single ingredient of Wal-Mart\u0027s success. \\n\\n \\n\\n Most of these early guys were very egotistical people who loved to drive big Cadillacs and fly around intheir jets and vacation on their yachts, and some of them lived in houses like I\u0027d never even thought aboutbefore. I remember going to dinner at one of their houses, and we got picked up by this limousine thatmust have had room for fourteen people. Man, they were living high. And they could afford to back thenbecause this discounting thing was working so well. Customers just flocked to their stores, and thesefellows were covered up in cash. Most of them could still be around today if they had followed somebasic principles about running good stores. There are a lot of ways to build strong companies. They don\u0027thave to be done the Wal-Mart way, or my way, or anybody else\u0027s way. But you do have to work at it. \\n\\n \\n\\n And somewhere along the line, these folks stopped short of setting the goals and paying the price thatneeded to be paid. Maybe it wasn\u0027t the Cadillacs and the yachts, maybe they just decided it wasn\u0027t worthit. But whatever it was, they just didn\u0027t stay close enough to their business, they sort of chose to get overon the other side of the road. \\n\\n \\n\\n They expanded quickly without building the organizations and the supportsuch as distribution centersneeded to expand those companies. They didn\u0027t get out into their stores to see what was going on. ThenKmart got their machine in gear and began to do it better and better. I remember going in their storesI\u0027llbet I\u0027ve been in more Kmarts than anybodyand I would really envy their merchandise mix and the waythey presented it. So much about their stores was superior to ours back then that sometimes I felt like wecouldn\u0027t compete. Of course that didn\u0027t stop us from trying. And Target came along and did a fine job,taking the whole idea a little more upscale. As these big operators became more organized, thecompetition grew a lot more difficult. That\u0027s when all those guys who were failing to meet their customers\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n needs and who didn\u0027t build strong organizationsall those promotersstarted to fall apart and, eventually,fall out. \\n\\n \\n\\n Actually, during this whole early period, Wal-Mart was too small and insignificant for any of the big boysto notice, and most of the promoters weren\u0027t out in our area so we weren\u0027t competitive. That helped meget access to a lot of information about how they were doing things. I probably visited more headquartersoffices of more discounters than anybody elseever. I would just show up and say, \"Hi, I\u0027m Sam Waltonfrom Bentonville, Arkansas. We\u0027ve got a few stores out there, and I\u0027d like to visit with Mr. \\n\\n \\n\\n So-and-So\"whoever the head of the company was\"about his business.\" And as often as not, they\u0027d letme in, maybe out of curiosity, and I\u0027d ask lots of questions about pricing and distribution, whatever. Ilearned a lot that way. \\n\\n \\n\\n KURT BARNARD, RETAILING CONSULTANT: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was executive vice president of the discounters\u0027 trade association, working in my New York officeone day in 1967. My secretary said there was a man out front who wanted to join our group. I said Iwould give him ten minutes. So in comes this short, wiry man with a deep tan and a tennis racket underhis arm. He introduced himself as Sam Walton from Arkansas. I didn\u0027t know what to think. When hemeets you, he looks at youhead cocked to one side, forehead slightly creasedand he proceeds toextract every piece of information in your possession. He always makes little notes. And he pushes onand on. After two and a half hours, he left, and I was totally drained. I wasn\u0027t sure what I had just met,but I was sure we would hear more from him.\"Looking at everybody else\u0027s companies made me feel we were definitely headed in the right direction. \\n\\n \\n\\n But as we developed, we began to feel a little out of control. In the late sixties, we had more than adozen Wal-Marts and fourteen or fifteen variety stores, which is a pretty good-sized company to berunning with three ladies, myself, and Don Whitaker in the office, and a manager in each store. I alreadytold you what scrubby buyers we were. We had a lot of people with little or no experience, or notenough knowledge of how bigger operations actually worked. I made up my mind that we had to getsomebody with management under his belt. I had hired Gary Reinboth from J. J. \\n\\n \\n\\n Newberry, a big variety chain that was having some problems at the time, so I asked him if he knewanybody, and he told me about this guy up in Omaha named Ferold Arend. He was Newberry\u0027s districtmanager and head of merchandise for the whole Midwest, so Bud and I flew out to see him. We talkedhim and his wife into coming down and looking at our operation. \\n\\n \\n\\n Ferold arend, wal-mart\u0027s first vice president of operations, and later its president: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In the middle of 1966, Wal-Mart No. 5 was under construction in Conway, Arkansas, and Sam was allexcited and said, \u0027I\u0027ve got to show you these plans.\u0027 So he loaded my wife and me in his plane and weflew down there. The store had a cotton mill on one side and a stockyard on the other, and it was in aterrible neighborhood. My first thought was: This is not a very good place for a store.\u0027 I also thought theBentonville store didn\u0027t seem to have any organization to the way it was run. Let\u0027s just say I wasn\u0027t veryimpressed with the whole Sam Walton operation at that time. I told him I wasn\u0027t interested. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Later on, after that Conway Wal-Mart opened up, Sam called me and told me what the sales were. Ithought, \u0027My gosh, that store did as much in one day as some of our bigger stores do in a month.\u0027 Andthen he told me he was only paying ninety cents a square foot. And I thought, \u0027He must have somethingthere.\u0027 About that time, Newberry\u0027s decided to reorganize and I was going to have to move to a newdivision. So I thought, \u0027Well, if I\u0027m going to have to start over in a company where I\u0027ve worked fortwenty-one years, why not look at something I\u0027m really interested in\u0027 and that was discounting and SamWalton. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here I was coming in as vice president, and it took some getting used to. The offices were still up onthe square in Bentonville, and Sam had just got through remodeling themwhich I\u0027m sure was a greatimprovementbut in my opinion they weren\u0027t much. The offices were in an old narrow hallwayupstairssome were over the barbershop and others were over an attorney\u0027s office. The floor sagged upthere, about four inches from the wall to the center. And they had some partitions and some woodpaneling, and they were real little offices. It was very close-knit up there.\"Even if he couldn\u0027t tell it by the office we gave him, bringing Ferold in was an important step for ourcompany. I knew we had to get better organized than we were. We still had to build a basic merchandiseassortment, and a real replenishment system. We had lists of items we were supposed to carry, and wewere dependent on the people in the stores to keep good records of everything manuallythis was at atime when quite a few people were beginning to go into computerization. I had read a lot about that, andI was curious. I made up my mind I was going to learn something about IBM computers. So I enrolled inan IBM school for retailers in Poughkeepsie, New York. One of the speakers was a guy from theNational Mass Retailers\u0027 Institute (NMRI), the discounters\u0027 trade association, a guy named Abe Marks. \\n\\n \\n\\n ABE MARKS, HEAD OF HARTFIELD ZODY\u0027S, AND FIRST PRESIDENT, NMRI: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was sitting there at the conference reading the paper, and I had a feeling somebody was standing overme, so I look up and there\u0027s this grayish gentleman standing there in a black suit carrying an attach case. \\n\\n \\n\\n And I said to myself, \u0027Who is this guy He looks like an undertaker.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He asks me if I\u0027m Abe Marks and I say, \u0027Yes, I am.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \" \u0027Let me introduce myself, my name is Sam Walton,\u0027 he says. \u0027I\u0027m only a little fellow from Bentonville,Arkansas, and I\u0027m in the retail business.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I say, \u0027You\u0027ll have to pardon me, Sam, I thought I knew everybody and every company in the retailbusiness, but I never heard of Sam Walton. What did you say the name of your company is again\"\" \u0027Wal-Mart Stores,\u0027 he says. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So I say, \u0027Well, welcome to the fraternity of discount merchants. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll enjoy the conferenceand getting acquainted socially with everyone.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \" \u0027Well, to be perfectly honest with you, Mr. Marks, I didn\u0027t come here to socialize, I came here to meetyou. I know you\u0027re a CPA and you\u0027re able to keep confidences, and I really wanted your opinion onwhat I am doing now.\u0027 So he opens up this attach case, and, I swear, he had every article I had everwritten and every speech I had ever given in there. I\u0027m thinking, \u0027This is a very thorough man.\u0027 Then hehands me an accountant\u0027s working column sheet, showing all his operating categories all written out byhand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then he says: \u0027Tell me what\u0027s wrong. What am I doing wrong\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I look at these numbersthis was in 1966and I don\u0027t believe what I\u0027m seeing. He\u0027s got a handful ofstores and he\u0027s doing about $10 million a year with some incredible margin. An unbelievableperformance! \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So I look at it, and I say, \u0027What are you doing wrong Samif I may call you SamI\u0027ll tell you what youare doing wrong.\u0027 I handed back his papers and I closed his attach case, and I said to him, \u0027Being hereis wrong, Sam. Don\u0027t unpack your bags. Go down, catch a cab, go back to the airport and go back towhere you came from and keep doing exactly what you are doing. There is nothing that can possiblyimprove what you are doing. You are a genius.\u0027 That\u0027s how I met Sam Walton.\"Abe invited me to join the NMRI and it turned out to be quite a valuable association for me. I was onthe board for about fifteen years, and made some terrific contacts and generous friends. I visited withAbe a number of times at his New York offices, and he was a very open guy. He shared with me how heused computers to control his merchandise. \\n\\n \\n\\n ABE MARKS: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Our system was rudimentary by today\u0027s standards, but it was very advanced for the 1960s. Very fewcompanies controlled their merchandise the way we did. Sam spent a lot of time reviewing theseoperations and he brought some of his people up to review them. He has just been a master of taking thebest out of everything and adapting it to his own needs. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What we helped him with in the early days was really logistics. It\u0027s like in the Army. You can movetroops all over the world, but unless you have the capacity to supply them with ammunition and food,there\u0027s no sense putting them out there. Sam understood that. He knew that he was already in what thetrade calls an \u0027absentee ownership\u0027 situation. That just means you\u0027re putting your stores out where you, asmanagement, aren\u0027t. If he wanted to grow he had to learn to control it. So to service these stores you\u0027vegot to have timely information: How much merchandise is in the store What is it What\u0027s selling andwhat\u0027s not What is to be ordered, marked down, replaced To get more technical, that helps youcontrol what we call turn, or inventory turnoverthe ratio of sales to inventory. That\u0027s a key. The moreyou turn your inventory, the less capital is required. And all this involves getting the merchandise to thestore at the right time, communicating how it\u0027s being priced and how it\u0027s being marked down, whatever. \\n\\n \\n\\n Logistics. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Anyway, the man\u0027s a genius. He realizedeven at the rudimentary level he was on in 1966, operatingthose few stores that he hadthat he couldn\u0027t expand beyond that horizon unless he had the ability tocapture this information on paper so that he could control his operations, no matter where they might be. \\n\\n \\n\\n He became, really, the best utilizer of information to control absentee ownerships that there\u0027s ever been. \\n\\n \\n\\n Which gave him the ability to open as many stores as he opens, and run them as well as he runs them,and to be as profitable as he makes them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got to realize this too. By being at that conference, he was absolutely in the right place at theright time. There were no such things in those days as minicomputers and microcomputers. He was reallyten years away from the computer world coming. But he was preparing himself. And this is a veryimportant point: without the computer, Sam Walton could not have done what he\u0027s done. He could nothave built a retailing empire the size of what he\u0027s built, the way he built it. He\u0027s done a lot of other thingsright, too, but he could not have done it without the computer. It would have been impossible.\"Much as I hate to admit to something like that, I expect Abe is probably right. His memory\u0027s pretty goodabout why I was at that conference, too. I wanted to show him my books, and I wanted to ask himabout merchandise control. But I knew I\u0027d never be any whizbang computer guy myself, so I had anotherreason for going to that school: I was looking to hire a good, bright systems person, and I figured I mightfind one there. As it happened, there were all sorts of bright people in that school. Dale Wormana veryastute retailer from the Fred Meyer company out in Portland and now a good friendwas there, as wasArlie Lazarus, who became president of Herb Fisher\u0027s Jamesway Corp. And, of course, that\u0027s where Ifirst met Ron Mayer, then the smart young chief financial officer at Duckwall Stores in Abilene, Kansas. Itargeted him as the guy we needed at Wal-Mart, and started wooing him right there. Like so many ofthem, he wasn\u0027t interested just then in moving to Bentonville, Arkansas, to work for somebody he knewnext to nothing about. Later on, we changed his mind. \\n\\n \\n\\n But I had another problem on my mind when I went up there: distribution. All these other guys, like AbeMarks, were in large urban markets, and their stores were being supplied by big distributors. Kmart andWoolco were using the same distribution system that was supplying their thousands of variety stores. Sohere we were out in the sticks with nobody to distribute to our stores, which meant basically that ourmanagers would order from salesmen and then some day or other a truck from somewhere would comealong and drop off the merchandise. Even at the stage we were in, this was totally unworkable. A lot ofour stores weren\u0027t big enough to order whole pallets of merchandise, so we had rented that old garage indowntown Bentonville as our warehouse. We would have big shipments delivered there, then unpackthem and repack them into smaller quantities. Then we\u0027d call the trucklines to come get them and takethem to the stores. It was expensive and inefficient. Somewhere in that period, Ferold and I had hiredanother fellow from Newberry\u0027s, Bob Thornton, who had been running a distribution center for them inOmaha, with the promise that we were going to build a distribution center for him to run. \\n\\n \\n\\n BOB THORNTON: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He hired me with the full understanding that I was going to put together a warehouse and distributionsystem. I accepted the job, moved down here, and started drawing some plans. Then one day heproceeds to tell me he doesn\u0027t know for sure whether we really need a warehouse yet or not. It upset meto no end because that was really the only field I wanted to be into. I said, \u0027Gee, Sam, I want to run awarehouse.\u0027 For about six months to a year there, I just worked doing various things around thecompany, and in my spare time I drew up plans for a distribution center. There wasn\u0027t room for me in theoffice so they knocked a hole through the wall and went into the upstairs of the shoe store next door. Itwas kind of like an attic, my office, with no heat or air conditioning in it. We had one old toilet for a restroom, with a screen-door hook on the door. And there were about twenty-five people working there bynow. Sam would come by every so often and tell me to keep working on drawing those warehouseplans, but I could see he wasn\u0027t sure about it at all.\"I knew we needed a warehouse. I just wanted to make sure we got the kind we needed, and at this timetoo, remember, we were financing everything ourselves. We were borrowing heavily to open new stores. \\n\\n \\n\\n But anyway, there was one guy at that same IBM schoola fellow up in Green Bay, Wisconsinwho wasthe only one who had a warehouse, a distribution center. He invited me to go look at it. So when I gothome from the school, I threw Don Whitaker and Ferold and Bob Thornton and some other folkstherewere six of us, I rememberinto a Beechcraft Baron I was flying in those days, and hauled us up to GreenBay, Wisconsin. We went through this warehouse, saw how they did it, took a lot of notes on everything. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was computerized, one of the first computerized warehouses I know anything about. \\n\\n \\n\\n After that trip, I knew we had to build one, and everybody was pressuring me for a new general office,so we bought fifteen acres on a farm right outside Bentonville, where we still are today, for about$25,000. Bob was in charge of building us a new 15,000-foot general office, which I thought would lastus forever, and a 60;000-foot warehouse, which I thought was too big, but Ferold convinced me weneeded it. \\n\\n \\n\\n BOB THORNTON: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As I recall, my blueprint for the warehouse called for 100,000 square feet, which to me was veryminimal. Then Sam decided to get an architect involved. When I got to look at the drawing, I thought,\u0027Well, this can\u0027t be right. It\u0027s only 60,000 square feet.\u0027 So I went to tell Sam about it, and he said, \u0027Well, Icalled the architect and told him to cut it back. I just don\u0027t think we need that 100,000 square feet, Bob.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Another thing. I had designed that distribution center around an in-floor towline system, you know, atrack that moves carts around the floor. Sam says, \u0027Well, Bob, I just don\u0027t think we can do that. We can\u0027tspend that kind of money.\u0027 At that point, I literally didn\u0027t know how to run a warehouse without one so Ijust said, \u0027Hey, Sam, if we don\u0027t have a towline system, then you don\u0027t need me because I don\u0027t knowwhat to do without it.\u0027 So he gave in to that. The truth is, Sam never didanything in size or volume untilhe actually had to. He always played it close to the belt.\"It\u0027s true enough that I was nervous about spending any unnecessary money in those days. We weregenerating as much financing for growth as we could from the profits of the stores, but we were alsoborrowing everything we could. I was taking on a lot of personal debt to grow the companyitapproached $2 million, which was a lot of money at the time. The debt was beginning to weigh on me. \\n\\n \\n\\n By now I no longer had any doubt that we were really on to something. We had expanded to MissouriSikeston was our first store there. And we\u0027d put stores in Neosho and West Plains. We\u0027d gone toClare-more, OklahomaHelen\u0027s hometown. Our first seven or eight Wal-Marts were showingspectacular results. Once we got it going, it was hard to see why we should quit. The thing was, youcould see the potential so clearly. The profits and the sales were there but we needed to get betterorganized and come up with a more sensible way to finance the growth. I needed someone to help mewith systems and distribution. \\n\\n \\n\\n I had stayed in touch with Ron Mayer, and I kept after him to work for us. Finally, I talked him intocoming down to look over our operations, and then darned near killed him before he ever had a chanceto sign on. We were flying around in my Beech Baron, looking at stores, and we were on our way in toland at Carthage, Missouriheaded for store number 12. There are two intersecting runways at Carthage,and as I touched down on one of them, all of a sudden up ahead we saw this plane on the other runway,right at the intersection, and we were headed straight at him. I hadn\u0027t seen him or heard him on the radio. \\n\\n \\n\\n I didn\u0027t know where he came from. I gave that Baron all the power it had and we just barely made it overthe top of the other plane. Then we circled around and landed. This was Ron\u0027s first trip with me, and whoknows what he must have thought. But somehow, I talked him into coming to work with us anyway. Hejoined Wal-Mart in 1968 as vice president for finance and distribution. \\n\\n \\n\\n Even though it may surprise some people, I have to say that I consider the time Ron was at thecompany, from 1968 until 1976 (when he left under some fairly unpleasant circumstances for both of us),to be the most important period of development in Wal-Mart\u0027s history. We had a good thing goingbefore Ron arrived, but he, and some of the people he brought on board, like Royce Chambers, our firstdata processing manager, gave the company its first sophisticated systems. And those systems were thebeginnings of a management method which allowed us to stay real close to our stores even as our growthexploded. \\n\\n \\n\\n We were forced to be ahead of our time in distribution and in communication because our stores weresitting out there in tiny little towns and we had to stay in touch and keep them supplied. Ron started theprograms that eventually improved our in-store communications system. Building on the groundworkalready laid by Ferold Arend, Ron also took over distribution and began to design and build a systemthat would enable us to grow as fast as we could come up with the money. He was the main force thatmoved us away from the old drop shipment method, in which a store ordered directly from themanufacturer and had the merchandise delivered directly to the store by common carrier. He pushed usin some new directions, such as merchandise assembly, in which we would order centrally for every storeand then assemble their orders at the distribution center, and also cross-docking, in which preassembledorders for individual stores would be received on one side of our warehouse and leave out the other. \\n\\n \\n\\n From Ron Mayer\u0027s arrival on, we as a company have been ahead of most other retailers in investing insophisticated equipment and technology. The funny thing is, everybody at Wal-Mart knows that I\u0027vefought all these technology expenditures as hard as I could. All these guys love to talk about how I neverwanted any of this technology, and how they had to lay down their life to get it. The truth is, I did want it,I knew we needed it, but I just couldn\u0027t bring myself to say, \"Okay, sure, spend what you need.\" I alwaysquestioned everything. It was important to me to make them think that maybe the technology wasn\u0027t asgood as they thought it was, or that maybe it really wasn\u0027t the end-all they promised it would be. It seemsto me they try just a little harder and check into things a little bit closer if they think they might have achance to prove me wrong. If I really hadn\u0027t wanted the technology, I wouldn\u0027t have sprung the moneyloose to pay for it. \\n\\n \\n\\n By the late sixties, we were really well positioned for serious growth. We had a retail concept webelieved in, the core of a professional management team, and the foundations of systems which wouldsupport growth. In 1968, we had fourteen variety stores and thirteen Wal-Marts. In 1969, we hadfourteen variety stores and eighteen Wal-Marts. And we were raring to go. I couldn\u0027t resist taking thatnext step to see how far we could go.
