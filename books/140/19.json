He\u0027salways saying things like \u0027This was the key to the whole thing,\u0027 or That was our real secret.\u0027 He knows aswell as anyone that there wasn\u0027t any magic formula. A lot of different things made it work, and in oneday\u0027s time he may cite all of them as the \u0027key\u0027 or the \u0027secret.\u0027 What\u0027s amazing is that for almost fifty yearshe\u0027s managed to focus on all of them at onceall the time. That\u0027s his real secret.\"DAVID GLASSI think we\u0027ve covered the story of how all my partners and associates and I over the years builtWal-Mart into what it is today. And in the telling, Ithink we\u0027ve covered all the principles which resulted inthe company\u0027s amazing success. A whole lot has changed about the retailing business in the forty-sevenyears we\u0027ve been in itincluding some of my theories. We\u0027ve changed our minds about some significantthings along the way and adopted some new principlesparticularly about the concept of partnership in acorporation. But most of the values and the rules and the techniques we\u0027ve relied on have stayed thesame the whole way. Some of them are such simple common-sense old favorites that they hardly seemworth mentioning. This isn\u0027t the first time that I\u0027ve been asked to come up with a list of rules for success, but itis the firsttime I\u0027ve actually sat down and done it. I\u0027m glad I did because it\u0027s been a revealing exercise for me. Thetruth is, David Glass is right. I do seem to have a couple of dozen things that I\u0027ve singled out at one timeor another as the \"key\" to the whole thing. One I don\u0027t even have on my list is \"work hard.\" If you don\u0027tknow that already, or you\u0027re not willing to do it, you probably won\u0027t be going far enough to need my listanyway. And another I didn\u0027t include on the list is the idea of building a team. If you want to build anenterprise of any size at all, it almost goes without saying that you absolutely must create a team of peoplewho work together and give real meaning to that overused word \"teamwork.\" To me, that\u0027s more thegoal of the whole thing, rather than some way to get there. I believe in always having goals, and always setting them high. I can certainly tell you that the folks atWal-Mart have always had goals in front of them. In fact, we have sometimes built real scoreboards onthe stage at Saturday morning meetings. One more thing. If you\u0027re really looking for my advice here, trying to get something serious out of thisexercise I put myself through, remember: these rules are not in any way intended to be the TenCommandments of Business. They are some rules that worked for me. But I always prided myself onbreaking everybody else\u0027s rules, and I always favored the mavericks who challenged my rules. I mayhave fought them all the way, but I respected them, and, in the end, I listened to them a lot more closelythan I did the pack who always agreed with everything I said. So pay special attention to Rule 10, and ifyou interpret it in the right spiritas it applies to youit could mean simply: Break All the Rules. For what they\u0027re worth, here they are. Sam\u0027s Rules for Building a Business: RULE 1: COMMIT to your business. Believe in it more than anybody else. I think I overcame everysingle one of my personal shortcomings by the sheer passion I brought to my work. I don\u0027t know if you\u0027reborn with this kind of passion, or if you can learn it. But I do know you need it. If you love your work,you\u0027ll be out there every day trying to do it the best you possibly can, and pretty soon everybody aroundwill catch the passion from you like a fever. RULE 2: SHARE your profits with all your associates, and treat them as partners. In turn, they will treatyou as a partner, and together you will all perform beyond your wildest expectations. Remain acorporation and retain control if you like, but behave as a servant leader in a partnership. Encourage your associates to hold a stake in the company. Offer discounted stock, and grant themstock for their retirement. It\u0027s the single best thing we ever did. RULE 3: MOTIVATE your partners. Money and ownership alone aren\u0027t enough. Constantly, day byday, think of new and more interesting ways to motivate and challenge your partners. Set high goals,encourage competition, and then keep score. Make bets with outrageous payoffs. If things get stale,cross-pollinate; have managers switch jobs with one another to stay challenged. Keep everybodyguessing as to what your next trick is going to be. Don\u0027t become too predictable. RULE 4: COMMUNICATE everything you possibly can to your partners. The more they know, themore they\u0027ll understand. The more they understand, the more they\u0027ll care. Once they care, there\u0027s nostopping them. If you don\u0027t trust your associates to know what\u0027s going on, they\u0027ll know you don\u0027t reallyconsider them partners. Information is power, and the gain you get from empowering your associatesmore than offsets the risk of informing your competitors. RULE 5: APPRECIATE everything your associates do for the business. A paycheck and a stock optionwill buy one kind of loyalty. But all of us like to be told how much somebody appreciates what we do forthem. We like to hear it often, and especially when we have done something we\u0027re really proud of. Nothing else can quite substitute for a few well-chosen, well-timed, sincere words of praise. They\u0027reabsolutely freeand worth a fortune. RULE 6: CELEBRATE your successes. Find some humor in your failures. Don\u0027t take yourself soseriously. Loosen up, and everybody around you will loosen up. Have fun. Show enthusiasmalways. When all else fails, put on a costume and sing a silly song. Then make everybody else sing with you. Don\u0027t do a hula on Wall Street. It\u0027s been done. Think up your own stunt. All of this is more important,and more fun, than you think, and it really fools the competition. \"Why should we take those cornballs atWal-Mart seriously\"RULE 7: LISTEN to everyone in your company. And figure out ways to get them talking. The folks onthe front linesthe ones who actually talk to the customerare the only ones who really know what\u0027s goingon out there. You\u0027d better find out what they know. This really is what total quality is all about. To pushresponsibility down in your organization, and to force good ideas to bubble up within it, youmust listen towhat your associates are trying to tell you. RULE 8: EXCEED your customers\u0027 expectations. If you do, they\u0027ll come back over and over. Givethem what they wantand a little more. Let them know you appreciate them. Make good on all yourmistakes, and don\u0027t make excusesapologize. Stand behind everything you do. The two most importantwords I ever wrote were on that first Wal-Mart sign: \"Satisfaction Guaranteed.\" They\u0027re still up there,and they have made all the difference. RULE 9: CONTROL your expenses better than your competition. This is where you can always find thecompetitive advantage. For twenty-five years runninglong before Wal-Mart was known as the nation\u0027slargest retailerwe ranked number one in our industry for the lowest ratio of expenses to sales. You canmake a lot of different mistakes and still recover if you run an efficient operation. Or you can be brilliantand still go out of business if you\u0027re too inefficient. RULE 10: SWIM upstream. Go the other way. Ignore the conventional wisdom. If everybody else isdoing it one way, there\u0027s a good chance you can find your niche by going in exactly the oppositedirection. But be prepared for a lot of folks to wave you down and tell you you\u0027re headed the wrongway. I guess in all my years, what I heard more often than anything was: a town of less than 50,000population cannot support a discount store for very long. Those are some pretty ordinary rules, some would say even simplistic. The hard part, the real challenge,is to constantly figure out ways to execute them. You can\u0027t just keep doing what works one time,because everything around you is always changing. To succeed, you have to stay out in front of thatchange.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/lizhi/933/28293.html","bookId":140,"book":{"id":140,"title":"富甲美国 : 零售大王沃尔顿自传 Sam Walton: Made In America","description":"简介： 几十年来，沃尔玛公司在沃尔顿家族的经营下蒸蒸日上，其连锁店已达4150家，遍布全球。2001年度公司收入达2189亿美元，超越美国石...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201311/26/10-42-47-51-1.jpg","type":"Inspirational","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/lizhi/933","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:22:51 AM"}}
