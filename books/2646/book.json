Ethan\u0027s reprisal -- bankrupting the nobleman and forcing his exile -- does little to appease his wrath. Ten years later, a haughty, mysterious beauty enchants Ethan -- the daughter of his enemy. At last, Ethan will have the revenge he\u0027s craved; he\u0027ll promise her marriage, seduce her, then cast her aside. \n Bitter hardships... \n When Madeleine van Rowen\u0027s family was suddenly plunged into destitution and dishonor, she steeled herself against further heartache. She never weakened, never trusted, until a towering, scarred Highlander relentlessly pursues her, breaking down her defenses. \n At what price forgiveness? \n The passion between them burns hotter than Ethan\u0027s fury, and soon he finds he can\u0027t let her go. But when Madeleine uncovers the truth about him, can Ethan convince her to accept all he now offers -- when he once destroyed everything she had?\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/if-you-deceive-maccarrick-brothers-3.jpg","author":"Kresley Cole","type":"Historical","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":0,"category":{"id":20,"name":"Historical","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
