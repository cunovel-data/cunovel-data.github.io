{"id":31817,"no":35,"title":"Chapter 35","content":"THE reader may rest satisfied that Tom\u0027s and Huck\u0027s windfall made a mighty stir in the poor little village of St. Petersburg. So vast a sum, all in actual cash, seemed next to incredible. It was talked about, gloated over, glorified, until the reason of many of the citizens tottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement. Every \"haunted\" house in St. Petersburg and the neighboring villages was dissected, plank by plank, and its foundations dug up and ransacked for hidden treasure -- and not by boys, but men – pretty grave, unromantic men, too, some of them. Wherever Tom and Huck appeared they were courted, admired, stared at. The boys were not able to remember that their remarks had possessed weight before; but now their sayings were treasured and repeated; everything they did seemed somehow to be regarded as remarkable; they had evidently lost the power of doing and saying commonplace things; moreover, their past history was raked up and discovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality. The village paper published biographical sketches of the boys.\\n\\n The Widow Douglas put Huck\u0027s money out at six per cent., and Judge Thatcher did the same with Tom\u0027s at Aunt Polly\u0027s request. Each lad had an income, now, that was simply prodigious -- a dollar for every week-day in the year and half of the Sundays. It was just what the minister got -- no, it was what he was promised -- he generally couldn\u0027t collect it. A dollar and a quarter a week would board, lodge, and school a boy in those old simple days -- and clothe him and wash him, too, for that matter.\\n\\n Judge Thatcher had conceived a great opinion of Tom. He said that no commonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave. When Becky told her father, in strict confidence, how Tom had taken her whipping at school, the Judge was visibly moved; and when she pleaded grace for the mighty lie which Tom had told in order to shift that whipping from her shoulders to his own, the Judge said with a fine outburst that it was a noble, a generous, a magnanimous lie -- a lie that was worthy to hold up its head and march down through history breast to breast with George Washington\u0027s lauded Truth about the hatchet! Becky thought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when he walked the floor and stamped his foot and said that. She went straight off and told Tom about it.\\n\\n Judge Thatcher hoped to see Tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some day. He said he meant to look to it that Tom should be admitted to the National Military Academy and afterward trained in the best law school in the country, in order that he might be ready for either career or both.\\n\\n Huck Finn\u0027s wealth and the fact that he was now under the Widow Douglas\u0027 protection introduced him into society -- no, dragged him into it, hurled him into it -- and his sufferings were almost more than he could bear. The widow\u0027s servants kept him clean and neat, combed and brushed, and they bedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had not one little spot or stain which he could press to his heart and know for a friend. He had to eat with a knife and fork; he had to use napkin, cup, and plate; he had to learn his book, he had to go to church; he had to talk so properly that speech was become insipid in his mouth; whithersoever he turned, the bars and shackles of civilization shut him in and bound him hand and foot.\\n\\n He bravely bore his miseries three weeks, and then one day turned up missing. For forty-eight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in great distress. The public were profoundly concerned; they searched high and low, they dragged the river for his body. Early the third morning Tom Sawyer wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheads down behind the abandoned slaughter-house, and in one of them he found the refugee. Huck had slept there; he had just breakfasted upon some stolen odds and ends of food, and was lying off, now, in comfort, with his pipe. He was unkempt, uncombed, and clad in the same old ruin of rags that had made him picturesque in the days when he was free and happy. Tom routed him out, told him the trouble he had been causing, and urged him to go home. Huck\u0027s face lost its tranquil content, and took a melancholy cast. He said:\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t talk about it, Tom. I\u0027ve tried it, and it don\u0027t work; it don\u0027t work, Tom. It ain\u0027t for me; I ain\u0027t used to it. The widder\u0027s good to me, and friendly; but I can\u0027t stand them ways. She makes me get up just at the same time every morning; she makes me wash, they comb me all to thunder; she won\u0027t let me sleep in the woodshed; I got to wear them blamed clothes that just smothers me, Tom; they don\u0027t seem to any air git through \u0027em, somehow; and they\u0027re so rotten nice that I can\u0027t set down, nor lay down, nor roll around anywher\u0027s; I hain\u0027t slid on a cellar-door for -- well, it \u0027pears to be years; I got to go to church and sweat and sweat -- I hate them ornery sermons! I can\u0027t ketch a fly in there, I can\u0027t chaw. I got to wear shoes all Sunday. The widder eats by a bell; she goes to bed by a bell; she gits up by a bell -- everything\u0027s so awful reg\u0027lar a body can\u0027t stand it.\"\\n\\n \"Well, everybody does that way, Huck.\"\\n\\n \"Tom, it don\u0027t make no difference. I ain\u0027t everybody, and I can\u0027t stand it. It\u0027s awful to be tied up so. And grub comes too easy – I don\u0027t take no interest in vittles, that way. I got to ask to go a-fishing; I got to ask to go in a-swimming -- dern\u0027d if I hain\u0027t got to ask to do everything. Well, I\u0027d got to talk so nice it wasn\u0027t no comfort -- I\u0027d got to go up in the attic and rip out awhile, every day, to git a taste in my mouth, or I\u0027d a died, Tom. The widder wouldn\u0027t let me smoke; she wouldn\u0027t let me yell, she wouldn\u0027t let me gape, nor stretch, nor scratch, before folks --\" [Then with a spasm of special irritation and injury] -- \"And dad fetch it, she prayed all the time! I never see such a woman! I HAD to shove, Tom -- I just had to. And besides, that school\u0027s going to open, and I\u0027d a had to go to it -- well, I wouldn\u0027t stand THAT, Tom. Looky-here, Tom, being rich ain\u0027t what it\u0027s cracked up to be. It\u0027s just worry and worry, and sweat and sweat, and a-wishing you was dead all the time. Now these clothes suits me, and this bar\u0027l suits me, and I ain\u0027t ever going to shake \u0027em any more. Tom, I wouldn\u0027t ever got into all this trouble if it hadn\u0027t \u0027a\u0027 ben for that money; now you just take my sheer of it along with your\u0027n, and gimme a ten-center sometimes -- not many times, becuz I don\u0027t give a dern for a thing \u0027thout it\u0027s tollable hard to git -- and you go and beg off for me with the widder.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, Huck, you know I can\u0027t do that. \u0027Tain\u0027t fair; and besides if you\u0027ll try this thing just a while longer you\u0027ll come to like it.\"\\n\\n \"Like it! Yes -- the way I\u0027d like a hot stove if I was to set on it long enough. No, Tom, I won\u0027t be rich, and I won\u0027t live in them cussed smothery houses. I like the woods, and the river, and hogsheads, and I\u0027ll stick to \u0027em, too. Blame it all! just as we\u0027d got guns, and a cave, and all just fixed to rob, here this dern foolishness has got to come up and spile it all!\"\\n\\n Tom saw his opportunity --\\n\\n \"Lookyhere, Huck, being rich ain\u0027t going to keep me back from turning robber.\"\\n\\n \"No! Oh, good-licks; are you in real dead-wood earnest, Tom?\"\\n\\n \"Just as dead earnest as I\u0027m sitting here. But Huck, we can\u0027t let you into the gang if you ain\u0027t respectable, you know.\"\\n\\n Huck\u0027s joy was quenched.\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t let me in, Tom? Didn\u0027t you let me go for a pirate?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but that\u0027s different. A robber is more high-toned than what a pirate is -- as a general thing. In most countries they\u0027re awful high up in the nobility -- dukes and such.\"\\n\\n \"Now, Tom, hain\u0027t you always ben friendly to me? You wouldn\u0027t shet me out, would you, Tom? You wouldn\u0027t do that, now, would you, Tom?\"\\n\\n \"Huck, I wouldn\u0027t want to, and I don\u0027t want to -- but what would people say? Why, they\u0027d say, \u0027Mph! Tom Sawyer\u0027s Gang! Pretty low characters in it!\u0027 They\u0027d mean you, Huck. You wouldn\u0027t like that, and I wouldn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n Huck was silent for some time, engaged in a mental struggle. Finally he said:\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027ll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if I can come to stand it, if you\u0027ll let me b\u0027long to the gang, Tom.\"\\n\\n \"All right, Huck, it\u0027s a whiz! Come along, old chap, and I\u0027ll ask the widow to let up on you a little, Huck.\"\\n\\n \"Will you, Tom -- now will you? That\u0027s good. If she\u0027ll let up on some of the roughest things, I\u0027ll smoke private and cuss private, and crowd through or bust. When you going to start the gang and turn robbers?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, right off. We\u0027ll get the boys together and have the initiation to-night, maybe.\"\\n\\n \"Have the which?\"\\n\\n \"Have the initiation.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s to swear to stand by one another, and never tell the gang\u0027s secrets, even if you\u0027re chopped all to flinders, and kill anybody and all his family that hurts one of the gang.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s gay -- that\u0027s mighty gay, Tom, I tell you.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I bet it is. And all that swearing\u0027s got to be done at midnight, in the lonesomest, awfulest place you can find -- a ha\u0027nted house is the best, but they\u0027re all ripped up now.\"\\n\\n \"Well, midnight\u0027s good, anyway, Tom.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, so it is. And you\u0027ve got to swear on a coffin, and sign it with blood.\"\\n\\n \"Now, that\u0027s something like! Why, it\u0027s a million times bullier than pirating. I\u0027ll stick to the widder till I rot, Tom; and if I git to be a reg\u0027lar ripper of a robber, and everybody talking \u0027bout it, I reckon she\u0027ll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet.\"\\n\\n 　　　 CONCLUSION\\n\\n SO endeth this chronicle. It being strictly a history of a boy, it must stop here; the story could not go much further without becoming the history of a man. When one writes a novel about grown people, he knows exactly where to stop -- that is, with a marriage; but when he writes of juveniles, he must stop where he best can.\\n\\n Most of the characters that perform in this book still live, and are prosperous and happy. Some day it may seem worth while to take up the story of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they turned out to be; therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that part of their lives at present.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/51/3287.html","bookId":586,"book":{"id":586,"title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer汤姆.索亚历险记","description":"简介： The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain is a popular 1876 novel about a young boy growing up in a small town along the Mississippi River.
