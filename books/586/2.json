{"id":31784,"no":2,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"SATURDAY morning was come, and all the summer world was bright and fresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart; and if the heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer in every face and a spring in every step. The locust-trees were in bloom and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond the village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far enough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting. Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board fence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at the gate with a tin pail, and singing ~Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom\u0027s eyes, before, but now it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at the pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting, skylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred and fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an hour -- and even then somebody generally had to go after him. Tom said: \"Say, Jim, I\u0027ll fetch the water if you\u0027ll whitewash some.\" Jim shook his head and said: \"Can\u0027t, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an\u0027 git dis water an\u0027 not stop foolin\u0027 roun\u0027 wid anybody. She say she spec\u0027 Mars Tom gwine to ax me to whitewash, an\u0027 so she tole me go \u0027long an\u0027 \u0027tend to my own business -- she \u0027lowed she\u0027d \u0027tend to de whitewashin\u0027.\" \"Oh, never you mind what she said, Jim. That\u0027s the way she always talks. Gimme the bucket -- I won\u0027t be gone only a a minute. SHE won\u0027t ever know.\" \"Oh, I dasn\u0027t, Mars Tom. Ole missis she\u0027d take an\u0027 tar de head off\u0027n me. \u0027Deed she would.\" \"She! She never licks anybody -- whacks \u0027em over the head with her thimble -- and who cares for that, I\u0027d like to know. She talks awful, but talk don\u0027t hurt -- anyways it don\u0027t if she don\u0027t cry. Jim, I\u0027ll give you a marvel. I\u0027ll give you a white alley!\" Jim began to waver. \"White alley, Jim! And it\u0027s a bully taw.\" \"My! Dat\u0027s a mighty gay marvel, I tell you! But Mars Tom I\u0027s powerful \u0027fraid ole missis --\" \"And besides, if you will I\u0027ll show you my sore toe.\" Jim was only human -- this attraction was too much for him. He put down his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing interest while the bandage was being unwound. In another moment he was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye. But Tom\u0027s energy did not last. He began to think of the fun he had planned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the free boys would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions, and they would make a world of fun of him for having to work -- the very thought of it burnt him like fire. He got out his worldly wealth and examined it -- bits of toys, marbles, and trash; enough to buy an exchange of WORK, maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour of pure freedom. So he returned his straitened means to his pocket, and gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless moment an inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a great, magnificent inspiration. He took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers hove in sight presently -- the very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been dreading. Ben\u0027s gait was the hop-skip-and-jump -- proof enough that his heart was light and his anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and giving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. As he drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned far over to star-board and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp and circumstance -- for he was personating the Big missouri, and considered himself to be drawing nine feet of water. He was boat and captain and engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on his own hurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them: \"Stop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!\" The headway ran almost out, and he drew up slowly toward the sidewalk. \"Ship up to back! Ting-a-ling-ling!\" His arms straightened and stiffened down his sides. \"Set her back on the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow! ch-chow-wow! Chow!\" His right hand, meantime, describing stately circles -- for it was representing a forty-foot wheel. \"Let her go back on the labboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ch-chow-chow!\" The left hand began to describe circles. \"Stop the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop the labboard! Come ahead on the stabboard! Stop her! Let your outside turn over slow! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ow-ow! Get out that head-line! lively now! Come -- out with your spring-line -- what\u0027re you about there! Take a turn round that stump with the bight of it! Stand by that stage, now -- let her go! Done with the engines, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!\" \"Sh\u0027t! s\u0027h\u0027t! sh\u0027t!\" (trying the gauge-cocks). Tom went on whitewashing -- paid no attention to the steamboat. Ben stared a moment and then said: \"Hi-Yi! you\u0027re up a stump, ain\u0027t you!\" No answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as before. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom\u0027s mouth watered for the apple, but he stuck to his work. Ben said: \"Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?\" Tom wheeled suddenly and said: \"Why, it\u0027s you, Ben! I warn\u0027t noticing.\" \"Say -- I\u0027m going in a-swimming, I am. Don\u0027t you wish you could? But of course you\u0027d druther work -- wouldn\u0027t you? Course you would!\" Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said: \"What do you call work?\" \"Why, ain\u0027t that work?\" Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly: \"Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain\u0027t. All I know, is, it suits Tom Sawyer.\" \"Oh come, now, you don\u0027t mean to let on that you like it?\" The brush continued to move. \"Like it? Well, I don\u0027t see why I oughtn\u0027t to like it. Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?\" That put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple. Tom swept his brush daintily back and forth -- stepped back to note the effect -- added a touch here and there -- criticised the effect again -- Ben watching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more absorbed. Presently he said: \"Say, Tom, let me whitewash a little.\" Tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind: \"No -- no -- I reckon it wouldn\u0027t hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly\u0027s awful particular about this fence -- right here on the street, you know -- but if it was the back fence I wouldn\u0027t mind and she wouldn\u0027t. Yes, she\u0027s awful particular about this fence; it\u0027s got to be done very careful; I reckon there ain\u0027t one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it the way it\u0027s got to be done.\" \"No -- is that so? Oh come, now -- lemme just try. Only just a little -- I\u0027d let you, if you was me, Tom.\" \"Ben, I\u0027d like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly -- well, Jim wanted to do it, but she wouldn\u0027t let him; Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn\u0027t let Sid. Now don\u0027t you see how I\u0027m fixed? If you was to tackle this fence and anything was to happen to it --\" \"Oh, shucks, I\u0027ll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say -- I\u0027ll give you the core of my apple.\" \"Well, here -- No, Ben, now don\u0027t. I\u0027m afeard --\" \"I\u0027ll give you all of it!\" Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity in his heart. And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in the sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by, dangled his legs, munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more innocents. There was no lack of material; boys happened along every little while; they came to jeer, but remained to whitewash. By the time Ben was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for a kite, in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny Miller bought in for a dead rat and a string to swing it with -- and so on, and so on, hour after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in wealth. He had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part of a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a spool cannon, a key that wouldn\u0027t unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles, six fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass doorknob, a dog-collar -- but no dog -- the handle of a knife, four pieces of orange-peel, and a dilapidated old window sash. He had had a nice, good, idle time all the while -- plenty of company -- and the fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If he hadn\u0027t run out of whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village. Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it -- namely, that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain. If he had been a great and wise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have comprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do, and that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. And this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or performing on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing Mont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in England who drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn it into work and then they would resign.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/51/3254.html","bookId":586,"book":{"id":586,"title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer汤姆.索亚历险记","description":"简介： The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain is a popular 1876 novel about a young boy growing up in a small town along the Mississippi River.
