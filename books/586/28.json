{"id":31810,"no":28,"title":"Chapter 28","content":"THAT night Tom and Huck were ready for their adventure. They hung about the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine, one watching the alley at a distance and the other the tavern door. Nobody entered the alley or left it; nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or left the tavern door. The night promised to be a fair one; so Tom went home with the understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on, Huck was to come and \"maow,\" whereupon he would slip out and try the keys. But the night remained clear, and Huck closed his watch and retired to bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve.\n Tuesday the boys had the same ill luck. Also Wednesday. But Thursday night promised better. Tom slipped out in good season with his aunt\u0027s old tin lantern, and a large towel to blindfold it with. He hid the lantern in Huck\u0027s sugar hogshead and the watch began. An hour before midnight the tavern closed up and its lights (the only ones thereabouts) were put out. No Spaniard had been seen. Nobody had entered or left the alley. Everything was auspicious. The blackness of darkness reigned, the perfect stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of distant thunder.\n Tom got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it closely in the towel, and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern. Huck stood sentry and Tom felt his way into the alley. Then there was a season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon Huck\u0027s spirits like a mountain. He began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern -- it would frighten him, but it would at least tell him that Tom was alive yet. It seemed hours since Tom had disappeared. Surely he must have fainted; maybe he was dead; maybe his heart had burst under terror and excitement. In his uneasiness Huck found himself drawing closer and closer to the alley; fearing all sorts of dreadful things, and momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away his breath. There was not much to take away, for he seemed only able to inhale it by thimblefuls, and his heart would soon wear itself out, the way it was beating. Suddenly there was a flash of light and Tom came tearing by him: \"Run!\" said he; \"run, for your life!\"\n He needn\u0027t have repeated it; once was enough; Huck was making thirty or forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered. The boys never stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughterhouse at the lower end of the village. Just as they got within its shelter the storm burst and the rain poured down. As soon as Tom got his breath he said:\n \"Huck, it was awful! I tried two of the keys, just as soft as I could; but they seemed to make such a power of racket that I couldn\u0027t hardly get my breath I was so scared. They wouldn\u0027t turn in the lock, either. Well, without noticing what I was doing, I took hold of the knob, and open comes the door! It warn\u0027t locked! I hopped in, and shook off the towel, and, great Caesar\u0027s ghost!\"\n \"What! -- what\u0027d you see, Tom?\"\n \"Huck, I most stepped onto Injun Joe\u0027s hand!\"\n \"No!\"\n \"Yes! He was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his old patch on his eye and his arms spread out.\"\n \"Lordy, what did you do? Did he wake up?\"\n \"No, never budged. Drunk, I reckon. I just grabbed that towel and started!\"\n \"I\u0027d never \u0027a\u0027 thought of the towel, I bet!\"\n \"Well, I would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost it.\"\n \"Say, Tom, did you see that box?\"\n \"Huck, I didn\u0027t wait to look around. I didn\u0027t see the box, I didn\u0027t see the cross. I didn\u0027t see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor by Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room. Don\u0027t you see, now, what\u0027s the matter with that ha\u0027nted room?\"\n \"How?\"\n \"Why, it\u0027s ha\u0027nted with whiskey! Maybe ALL the Temperance Taverns have got a ha\u0027nted room, hey, Huck?\"\n \"Well, I reckon maybe that\u0027s so. Who\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 thought such a thing? But say, Tom, now\u0027s a mighty good time to get that box, if Injun Joe\u0027s drunk.\"\n \"It is, that! You try it!\"\n Huck shuddered.\n \"Well, no -- I reckon not.\"\n \"And I reckon not, Huck. Only one bottle alongside of Injun Joe ain\u0027t enough. If there\u0027d been three, he\u0027d be drunk enough and I\u0027d do it.\"\n There was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said:\n \"Lookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we know Injun Joe\u0027s not in there. It\u0027s too scary. Now, if we watch every night, we\u0027ll be dead sure to see him go out, some time or other, and then we\u0027ll snatch that box quicker\u0027n lightning.\"\n \"Well, I\u0027m agreed. I\u0027ll watch the whole night long, and I\u0027ll do it every night, too, if you\u0027ll do the other part of the job.\"\n \"All right, I will. All you got to do is to trot up Hooper Street a block and maow -- and if I\u0027m asleep, you throw some gravel at the window and that\u0027ll fetch me.\"\n \"Agreed, and good as wheat!\"\n \"Now, Huck, the storm\u0027s over, and I\u0027ll go home. It\u0027ll begin to be daylight in a couple of hours. You go back and watch that long, will you?\"\n \"I said I would, Tom, and I will. I\u0027ll ha\u0027nt that tavern every night for a year! I\u0027ll sleep all day and I\u0027ll stand watch all night.\"\n \"That\u0027s all right. Now, where you going to sleep?\"\n \"In Ben Rogers\u0027 hayloft. He lets me, and so does his pap\u0027s nigger man, Uncle Jake. I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he wants me to, and any time I ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it. That\u0027s a mighty good nigger, Tom. He likes me, becuz I don\u0027t ever act as if I was above him. Sometime I\u0027ve set right down and eat with him. But you needn\u0027t tell that. A body\u0027s got to do things when he\u0027s awful hungry he wouldn\u0027t want to do as a steady thing.\"\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/51/3280.html","bookId":586,"book":{"id":586,"title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer汤姆.索亚历险记","description":"简介： The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain is a popular 1876 novel about a young boy growing up in a small town along the Mississippi River.
