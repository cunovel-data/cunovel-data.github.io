{"id":31789,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 7","content":"THE harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more his ideas wandered. So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up. It seemed to him that the noon recess would never come. The air was utterly dead. There was not a breath stirring. It was the sleepiest of sleepy days. The drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees. Away off in the flaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a shimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds floated on lazy wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible but some cows, and they were asleep. Tom\u0027s heart ached to be free, or else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time. His hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it. Then furtively the percussion-cap box came out. He released the tick and put him on the long flat desk. The creature probably glowed with a gratitude that amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when he started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned him aside with a pin and made him take a new direction.\n Tom\u0027s bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as Tom had been, and now he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in an instant. This bosom friend was Joe Harper. The two boys were sworn friends all the week, and embattled enemies on Saturdays. Joe took a pin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner. The sport grew in interest momently. Soon Tom said that they were interfering with each other, and neither getting the fullest benefit of the tick. So he put Joe\u0027s slate on the desk and drew a line down the middle of it from top to bottom.\n \"Now,\" said he, \"as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and I\u0027ll let him alone; but if you let him get away and get on my side, you\u0027re to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from crossing over.\"\n \"All right, go ahead; start him up.\"\n The tick escaped from Tom, presently, and crossed the equator. Joe harassed him awhile, and then he got away and crossed back again. This change of base occurred often. While one boy was worrying the tick with absorbing interest, the other would look on with interest as strong, the two heads bowed together over the slate, and the two souls dead to all things else. At last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe. The tick tried this, that, and the other course, and got as excited and as anxious as the boys themselves, but time and again just as he would have victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom\u0027s fingers would be twitching to begin, Joe\u0027s pin would deftly head him off, and keep possession. At last Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation was too strong. So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin. Joe was angry in a moment. Said he:\n \"Tom, you let him alone.\"\n \"I only just want to stir him up a little, Joe.\"\n \"No, sir, it ain\u0027t fair; you just let him alone.\"\n \"Blame it, I ain\u0027t going to stir him much.\"\n \"Let him alone, I tell you.\"\n \"I won\u0027t!\"\n \"You shall -- he\u0027s on my side of the line.\"\n \"Look here, Joe Harper, whose is that tick?\"\n \"I don\u0027t care whose tick he is -- he\u0027s on my side of the line, and you sha\u0027n\u0027t touch him.\"\n \"Well, I\u0027ll just bet I will, though. He\u0027s my tick and I\u0027ll do what I blame please with him, or die!\"\n A tremendous whack came down on Tom\u0027s shoulders, and its duplicate on Joe\u0027s; and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from the two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it. The boys had been too absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile before when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over them. He had contemplated a good part of the performance before he contributed his bit of variety to it.\n When school broke up at noon, Tom flew to Becky Thatcher, and whispered in her ear:\n \"Put on your bonnet and let on you\u0027re going home; and when you get to the corner, give the rest of \u0027em the slip, and turn down through the lane and come back. I\u0027ll go the other way and come it over \u0027em the same way.\"\n So the one went off with one group of scholars, and the other with another. In a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane, and when they reached the school they had it all to themselves. Then they sat together, with a slate before them, and Tom gave Becky the pencil and held her hand in his, guiding it, and so created another surprising house. When the interest in art began to wane, the two fell to talking. Tom was swimming in bliss. He said:\n \"Do you love rats?\"\n \"No! I hate them!\"\n \"Well, I do, too -- live ones. But I mean dead ones, to swing round your head with a string.\"\n \"No, I don\u0027t care for rats much, anyway. What I like is chewing-gum.\"\n \"Oh, I should say so! I wish I had some now.\"\n \"Do you? I\u0027ve got some. I\u0027ll let you chew it awhile, but you must give it back to me.\"\n That was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled their legs against the bench in excess of contentment.\n \"Was you ever at a circus?\" said Tom.\n \"Yes, and my pa\u0027s going to take me again some time, if I\u0027m good.\"\n \"I been to the circus three or four times -- lots of times. Church ain\u0027t shucks to a circus. There\u0027s things going on at a circus all the time. I\u0027m going to be a clown in a circus when I grow up.\"\n \"Oh, are you! That will be nice. They\u0027re so lovely, all spotted up.\"\n \"Yes, that\u0027s so. And they get slathers of money -- most a dollar a day, Ben Rogers says. Say, Becky, was you ever engaged?\"\n \"What\u0027s that?\"\n \"Why, engaged to be married.\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Would you like to?\"\n \"I reckon so. I don\u0027t know. What is it like?\"\n \"Like? Why it ain\u0027t like anything. You only just tell a boy you won\u0027t ever have anybody but him, ever ever ever, and then you kiss and that\u0027s all. Anybody can do it.\"\n \"Kiss? What do you kiss for?\"\n \"Why, that, you know, is to -- well, they always do that.\"\n \"Everybody?\"\n \"Why, yes, everybody that\u0027s in love with each other. Do you remember what I wrote on the slate?\"\n \"Ye -- yes.\"\n \"What was it?\"\n \"I sha\u0027n\u0027t tell you.\"\n \"Shall I tell you?\"\n \"Ye -- yes -- but some other time.\"\n \"No, now.\"\n \"No, not now -- to-morrow.\"\n \"Oh, no, now. Please, Becky -- I\u0027ll whisper it, I\u0027ll whisper it ever so easy.\"\n Becky hesitating, Tom took silence for consent, and passed his arm about her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly, with his mouth close to her ear. And then he added:\n \"Now you whisper it to me -- just the same.\"\n She resisted, for a while, and then said:\n \"You turn your face away so you can\u0027t see, and then I will. But you mustn\u0027t ever tell anybody -- will you, Tom? Now you won\u0027t, will you?\"\n \"No, indeed, indeed I won\u0027t. Now, Becky.\"\n He turned his face away. She bent timidly around till her breath stirred his curls and whispered, \"I -- love -- you!\"\n Then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches, with Tom after her, and took refuge in a corner at last, with her little white apron to her face. Tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded:\n \"Now, Becky, it\u0027s all done -- all over but the kiss. Don\u0027t you be afraid of that -- it ain\u0027t anything at all. Please, Becky.\" And he tugged at her apron and the hands.\n By and by she gave up, and let her hands drop; her face, all glowing with the struggle, came up and submitted. Tom kissed the red lips and said:\n \"Now it\u0027s all done, Becky. And always after this, you know, you ain\u0027t ever to love anybody but me, and you ain\u0027t ever to marry anybody but me, ever never and forever. Will you?\"\n \"No, I\u0027ll never love anybody but you, Tom, and I\u0027ll never marry anybody but you -- and you ain\u0027t to ever marry anybody but me, either.\"\n \"Certainly. Of course. That\u0027s part of it. And always coming to school or when we\u0027re going home, you\u0027re to walk with me, when there ain\u0027t anybody looking -- and you choose me and I choose you at parties, because that\u0027s the way you do when you\u0027re engaged.\"\n \"It\u0027s so nice. I never heard of it before.\"\n \"Oh, it\u0027s ever so gay! Why, me and Amy Lawrence --\"\n The big eyes told Tom his blunder and he stopped, confused.\n \"Oh, Tom! Then I ain\u0027t the first you\u0027ve ever been engaged to!\"\n The child began to cry. Tom said:\n \"Oh, don\u0027t cry, Becky, I don\u0027t care for her any more.\"\n \"Yes, you do, Tom -- you know you do.\"\n Tom tried to put his arm about her neck, but she pushed him away and turned her face to the wall, and went on crying. Tom tried again, with soothing words in his mouth, and was repulsed again. Then his pride was up, and he strode away and went outside. He stood about, restless and uneasy, for a while, glancing at the door, every now and then, hoping she would repent and come to find him. But she did not. Then he began to feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong. It was a hard struggle with him to make new advances, now, but he nerved himself to it and entered. She was still standing back there in the corner, sobbing, with her face to the wall. Tom\u0027s heart smote him. He went to her and stood a moment, not knowing exactly how to proceed. Then he said hesitatingly:\n \"Becky, I -- I don\u0027t care for anybody but you.\"\n No reply -- but sobs.\n \"Becky\" -- pleadingly. \"Becky, won\u0027t you say something?\"\n More sobs.\n Tom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob from the top of an andiron, and passed it around her so that she could see it, and said:\n \"Please, Becky, won\u0027t you take it?\"\n She struck it to the floor. Then Tom marched out of the house and over the hills and far away, to return to school no more that day. Presently Becky began to suspect. She ran to the door; he was not in sight; she flew around to the play-yard; he was not there. Then she called:\n \"Tom! Come back, Tom!\"\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/51/3259.html","bookId":586,"book":{"id":586,"title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer汤姆.索亚历险记","description":"简介： The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain is a popular 1876 novel about a young boy growing up in a small town along the Mississippi River.
