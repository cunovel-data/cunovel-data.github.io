{"id":31801,"no":19,"title":"Chapter 19","content":"TOM arrived at home in a dreary mood, and the first thing his aunt said to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an unpromising market: \"Tom, I\u0027ve a notion to skin you alive!\" \"Auntie, what have I done?\" \"Well, you\u0027ve done enough. Here I go over to Sereny Harper, like an old softy, expecting I\u0027m going to make her believe all that rubbage about that dream, when lo and behold you she\u0027d found out from Joe that you was over here and heard all the talk we had that night. Tom, I don\u0027t know what is to become of a boy that will act like that. It makes me feel so bad to think you could let me go to Sereny Harper and make such a fool of myself and never say a word.\" This was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the morning had seemed to Tom a good joke before, and very ingenious. It merely looked mean and shabby now. He hung his head and could not think of anything to say for a moment. Then he said: \"Auntie, I wish I hadn\u0027t done it -- but I didn\u0027t think.\" \"Oh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but your own selfishness. You could think to come all the way over here from Jackson\u0027s Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and you could think to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you couldn\u0027t ever think to pity us and save us from sorrow.\" \"Auntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn\u0027t mean to be mean. I didn\u0027t, honest. And besides, I didn\u0027t come over here to laugh at you that night.\" \"What did you come for, then?\" \"It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn\u0027t got drownded.\" \"Tom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could believe you ever had as good a thought as that, but you know you never did -- and I know it, Tom.\" \"Indeed and \u0027deed I did, auntie -- I wish I may never stir if I didn\u0027t.\" \"Oh, Tom, don\u0027t lie -- don\u0027t do it. It only makes things a hundred times worse.\" \"It ain\u0027t a lie, auntie; it\u0027s the truth. I wanted to keep you from grieving -- that was all that made me come.\" \"I\u0027d give the whole world to believe that -- it would cover up a power of sins, Tom. I\u0027d \u0027most be glad you\u0027d run off and acted so bad. But it ain\u0027t reasonable; because, why didn\u0027t you tell me, child?\" \"Why, you see, when you got to talking about the funeral, I just got all full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church, and I couldn\u0027t somehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark back in my pocket and kept mum.\" \"What bark?\" \"The bark I had wrote on to tell you we\u0027d gone pirating. I wish, now, you\u0027d waked up when I kissed you -- I do, honest.\" The hard lines in his aunt\u0027s face relaxed and a sudden tenderness dawned in her eyes. \"Did you kiss me, Tom?\" \"Why, yes, I did.\" \"Are you sure you did, Tom?\" \"Why, yes, I did, auntie -- certain sure.\" \"What did you kiss me for, Tom?\" \"Because I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry.\" The words sounded like truth. The old lady could not hide a tremor in her voice when she said: \"Kiss me again, Tom! -- and be off with you to school, now, and don\u0027t bother me any more.\" The moment he was gone, she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a jacket which Tom had gone pirating in. Then she stopped, with it in her hand, and said to herself: \"No, I don\u0027t dare. Poor boy, I reckon he\u0027s lied about it -- but it\u0027s a blessed, blessed lie, there\u0027s such a comfort come from it. I hope the Lord -- I know the Lord will forgive him, because it was such goodheartedness in him to tell it. But I don\u0027t want to find out it\u0027s a lie. I won\u0027t look.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/51/3271.html","bookId":586,"book":{"id":586,"title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer汤姆.索亚历险记","description":"简介： The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain is a popular 1876 novel about a young boy growing up in a small town along the Mississippi River.
