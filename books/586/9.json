{"id":31791,"no":9,"title":"Chapter 9","content":"AT half-past nine, that night, Tom and Sid were sent to bed, as usual. They said their prayers, and Sid was soon asleep. Tom lay awake and waited, in restless impatience. When it seemed to him that it must be nearly daylight, he heard the clock strike ten! This was despair. He would have tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves demanded, but he was afraid he might wake Sid. So he lay still, and stared up into the dark. Everything was dismally still. By and by, out of the stillness, little, scarcely preceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking of the clock began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began to crack mysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were abroad. A measured, muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly\u0027s chamber. And now the tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate, began. Next the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the wall at the bed\u0027s head made Tom shudder -- it meant that somebody\u0027s days were numbered. Then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air, and was answered by a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom was in an agony. At last he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun; he began to doze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven, but he did not hear it. And then there came, mingling with his half-formed dreams, a most melancholy caterwauling. The raising of a neighboring window disturbed him. A cry of \"Scat! you devil!\" and the crash of an empty bottle against the back of his aunt\u0027s woodshed brought him wide awake, and a single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping along the roof of the \"ell\" on all fours. He \"meow\u0027d\" with caution once or twice, as he went; then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and thence to the ground. Huckleberry Finn was there, with his dead cat. The boys moved off and disappeared in the gloom. At the end of half an hour they were wading through the tall grass of the graveyard.\\n\\n It was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western kind. It was on a hill, about a mile and a half from the village. It had a crazy board fence around it, which leaned inward in places, and outward the rest of the time, but stood upright nowhere. Grass and weeds grew rank over the whole cemetery. All the old graves were sunken in, there was not a tombstone on the place; round-topped, worm-eaten boards staggered over the graves, leaning for support and finding none. \"Sacred to the memory of\" So-and-So had been painted on them once, but it could no longer have been read, on the most of them, now, even if there had been light.\\n\\n A faint wind moaned through the trees, and Tom feared it might be the spirits of the dead, complaining at being disturbed. The boys talked little, and only under their breath, for the time and the place and the pervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits. They found the sharp new heap they were seeking, and ensconced themselves within the protection of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet of the grave.\\n\\n Then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time. The hooting of a distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness. Tom\u0027s reflections grew oppressive. He must force some talk. So he said in a whisper:\\n\\n \"Hucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here?\"\\n\\n Huckleberry whispered:\\n\\n \"I wisht I knowed. It\u0027s awful solemn like, AIN\u0027T it?\"\\n\\n \"I bet it is.\"\\n\\n There was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this matter inwardly. Then Tom whispered:\\n\\n \"Say, Hucky -- do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?\"\\n\\n \"O\u0027 course he does. Least his sperrit does.\"\\n\\n Tom, after a pause:\\n\\n \"I wish I\u0027d said Mister Williams. But I never meant any harm. Everybody calls him Hoss.\"\\n\\n \"A body can\u0027t be too partic\u0027lar how they talk \u0027bout these-yer dead people, Tom.\"\\n\\n This was a damper, and conversation died again.\\n\\n Presently Tom seized his comrade\u0027s arm and said:\\n\\n \"Sh!\"\\n\\n \"What is it, Tom?\" And the two clung together with beating hearts.\\n\\n \"~sh! There \u0027tis again! Didn\u0027t you hear it?\"\\n\\n \"I --\"\\n\\n \"There! Now you hear it.\"\\n\\n \"Lord, Tom, they\u0027re coming! They\u0027re coming, sure. What\u0027ll we do?\"\\n\\n \"I dono. Think they\u0027ll see us?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, Tom, they can see in the dark, same as cats. I wisht I hadn\u0027t come.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, don\u0027t be afeard. I don\u0027t believe they\u0027ll bother us. We ain\u0027t doing any harm. If we keep perfectly still, maybe they won\u0027t notice us at all.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll try to, Tom, but, Lord, I\u0027m all of a shiver.\"\\n\\n \"Listen!\"\\n\\n The boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed. A muffled sound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard.\\n\\n \"Look! See there!\" whispered Tom. \"What is it?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s devil-fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful.\"\\n\\n Some vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an old-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable little spangles of light. Presently Huckleberry whispered with a shudder:\\n\\n \"It\u0027s the devils sure enough. Three of \u0027em! Lordy, Tom, we\u0027re goners! Can you pray?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll try, but don\u0027t you be afeard. They ain\u0027t going to hurt us. \u0027Now I lay me down to sleep, I --\u0027\"\\n\\n \"Sh!\"\\n\\n \"What is it, Huck?\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re humans! One of \u0027em is, anyway. One of \u0027em\u0027s old Muff Potter\u0027s voice.\"\\n\\n \"No -- \u0027tain\u0027t so, is it?\"\\n\\n \"I bet I know it. Don\u0027t you stir nor budge. He ain\u0027t sharp enough to notice us. Drunk, the same as usual, likely -- blamed old rip!\"\\n\\n \"All right, I\u0027ll keep still. Now they\u0027re stuck. Can\u0027t find it. Here they come again. Now they\u0027re hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red hot! They\u0027re p\u0027inted right, this time. Say, Huck, I know another o\u0027 them voices; it\u0027s Injun Joe.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s so -- that murderin\u0027 half-breed! I\u0027d druther they was devils a dern sight. What kin they be up to?\"\\n\\n The whisper died wholly out, now, for the three men had reached the grave and stood within a few feet of the boys\u0027 hiding-place.\\n\\n \"Here it is,\" said the third voice; and the owner of it held the lantern up and revealed the face of young Doctor Robinson.\\n\\n Potter and Injun Joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and a couple of shovels on it. They cast down their load and began to open the grave. The doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and came and sat down with his back against one of the elm trees. He was so close the boys could have touched him.\\n\\n \"Hurry, men!\" he said, in a low voice; \"the moon might come out at any moment.\"\\n\\n They growled a response and went on digging. For some time there was no noise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight of mould and gravel. It was very monotonous. Finally a spade struck upon the coffin with a dull woody accent, and within another minute or two the men had hoisted it out on the ground. They pried off the lid with their shovels, got out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground. The moon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid face. The barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it, covered with a blanket, and bound to its place with the rope. Potter took out a large spring-knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then said:\\n\\n \"Now the cussed thing\u0027s ready, Sawbones, and you\u0027ll just out with another five, or here she stays.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the talk!\" said Injun Joe.\\n\\n \"Look here, what does this mean?\" said the doctor. \"You required your pay in advance, and I\u0027ve paid you.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, and you done more than that,\" said Injun Joe, approaching the doctor, who was now standing. \"Five years ago you drove me away from your father\u0027s kitchen one night, when I come to ask for something to eat, and you said I warn\u0027t there for any good; and when I swore I\u0027d get even with you if it took a hundred years, your father had me jailed for a vagrant. Did you think I\u0027d forget? The Injun blood ain\u0027t in me for nothing. And now I\u0027ve GOT you, and you got to settle, you know!\"\\n\\n He was threatening the doctor, with his fist in his face, by this time. The doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground. Potter dropped his knife, and exclaimed:\\n\\n \"Here, now, don\u0027t you hit my pard!\" and the next moment he had grappled with the doctor and the two were struggling with might and main, trampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels. Injun Joe sprang to his feet, his eyes flaming with passion, snatched up Potter\u0027s knife, and went creeping, catlike and stooping, round and round about the combatants, seeking an opportunity. All at once the doctor flung himself free, seized the heavy headboard of Williams\u0027 grave and felled Potter to the earth with it – and in the same instant the half-breed saw his chance and drove the knife to the hilt in the young man\u0027s breast. He reeled and fell partly upon Potter, flooding him with his blood, and in the same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful spectacle and the two frightened boys went speeding away in the dark.\\n\\n Presently, when the moon emerged again, Injun Joe was standing over the two forms, contemplating them. The doctor murmured inarticulately, gave a long gasp or two and was still. The half-breed muttered:\\n\\n \"That score is settled -- damn you.\"\\n\\n Then he robbed the body. After which he put the fatal knife in Potter\u0027s open right hand, and sat down on the dismantled coffin. Three -- four -- five minutes passed, and then Potter began to stir and moan. His hand closed upon the knife; he raised it, glanced at it, and let it fall, with a shudder. Then he sat up, pushing the body from him, and gazed at it, and then around him, confusedly. His eyes met Joe\u0027s.\\n\\n \"Lord, how is this, Joe?\" he said.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a dirty business,\" said Joe, without moving.\\n\\n \"What did you do it for?\"\\n\\n \"I! I never done it!\"\\n\\n \"Look here! That kind of talk won\u0027t wash.\"\\n\\n Potter trembled and grew white.\\n\\n \"I thought I\u0027d got sober. I\u0027d no business to drink to-night. But it\u0027s in my head yet -- worse\u0027n when we started here. I\u0027m all in a muddle; can\u0027t recollect anything of it, hardly. Tell me, Joe -- honest, now, old feller -- did I do it? Joe, I never meant to -- \u0027pon my soul and honor, I never meant to, Joe. Tell me how it was, Joe. Oh, it\u0027s awful -- and him so young and promising.\"\\n\\n \"Why, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one with the headboard and you fell flat; and then up you come, all reeling and staggering like, and snatched the knife and jammed it into him, just as he fetched you another awful clip -- and here you\u0027ve laid, as dead as a wedge til now.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I didn\u0027t know what I was a-doing. I wish I may die this minute if I did. It was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement, I reckon. I never used a weepon in my life before, Joe. I\u0027ve fought, but never with weepons. They\u0027ll all say that. Joe, don\u0027t tell! Say you won\u0027t tell, Joe -- that\u0027s a good feller. I always liked you, Joe, and stood up for you, too. Don\u0027t you remember? You won\u0027t tell, will you, Joe?\" And the poor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer, and clasped his appealing hands.\\n\\n \"No, you\u0027ve always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter, and I won\u0027t go back on you. There, now, that\u0027s as fair as a man can say.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, Joe, you\u0027re an angel. I\u0027ll bless you for this the longest day I live.\" And Potter began to cry.\\n\\n \"Come, now, that\u0027s enough of that. This ain\u0027t any time for blubbering. You be off yonder way and I\u0027ll go this. Move, now, and don\u0027t leave any tracks behind you.\"\\n\\n Potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. The half-breed stood looking after him. He muttered:\\n\\n \"If he\u0027s as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he had the look of being, he won\u0027t think of the knife till he\u0027s gone so far he\u0027ll be afraid to come back after it to such a place by himself -- chicken-heart!\"\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/51/3261.html","bookId":586,"book":{"id":586,"title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer汤姆.索亚历险记","description":"简介： The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain is a popular 1876 novel about a young boy growing up in a small town along the Mississippi River.
