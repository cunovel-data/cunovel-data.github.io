{"id":5551,"no":2,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"2:1 [hgb] 外 邦 为 什 么 争 闹 ， 万 民 为 什 么 谋 算 虚 妄 的 事 。 [kjv] Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? [bbe] Why are the nations so violently moved, and why are the thoughts of the people so foolish? 2:2 [hgb] 世 上 的 君 王 一 齐 起 来 ， 臣 宰 一 同 商 议 ， 要 敌 挡 耶 和 华 ， 并 他 的 受 膏 者 ， [kjv] The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying, [bbe] The kings of the earth have taken their place, and the rulers are fixed in their purpose, against the Lord, and against the king of his selection, saying, 2:3 [hgb] 说 ， 我 们 要 挣 开 他 们 的 捆 绑 ， 脱 去 他 们 的 绳 索 。 [kjv] Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. [bbe] Let their chains be broken, and their cords taken from off us. 2:4 [hgb] 那 坐 在 天 上 的 必 发 笑 。 主 必 嗤 笑 他 们 。 [kjv] He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have them in derision. [bbe] Then he whose seat is in the heavens will be laughing: the Lord will make sport of them. 2:5 [hgb] 那 时 他 要 在 怒 中 责 备 他 们 ， 在 烈 怒 中 惊 吓 他 们 ， [kjv] Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure. [bbe] Then will his angry words come to their ears, and by his wrath they will be troubled: 2:6 [hgb] 说 ， 我 已 经 立 我 的 君 在 锡 安 我 的 圣 山 上 了 。 [kjv] Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. [bbe] But I have put my king on my holy hill of Zion. 2:7 [hgb] 受 膏 者 说 ， 我 要 传 圣 旨 。 耶 和 华 曾 对 我 说 ， 你 是 我 的 儿 子 ， 我 今 日 生 你 。 [kjv] I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee. [bbe] I will make clear the Lord\u0027s decision: he has said to me, You are my son, this day have I given you being. 2:8 [hgb] 你 求 我 ， 我 就 将 列 国 赐 你 为 基 业 ， 将 地 极 赐 你 为 田 产 。 [kjv] Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. [bbe] Make your request to me, and I will give you the nations for your heritage, and the farthest limits of the earth will be under your hand. 2:9 [hgb] 你 必 用 铁 杖 打 破 他 们 。 你 必 将 他 们 如 同 窑 匠 的 瓦 器 摔 碎 。 [kjv] Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter\u0027s vessel. [bbe] They will be ruled by you with a rod of iron; they will be broken like a potter\u0027s vessel. 2:10 [hgb] 现 在 你 们 君 王 应 当 省 悟 。 你 们 世 上 的 审 判 官 该 受 管 教 。 [kjv] Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. [bbe] So now be wise, you kings: take his teaching, you judges of the earth. 2:11 [hgb] 当 存 畏 惧 事 奉 耶 和 华 ， 又 当 存 战 兢 而 快 乐 。 [kjv] Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling. [bbe] Give worship to the Lord with fear, kissing his feet and giving him honour, 2:12 [hgb] 当 以 嘴 亲 子 ， 恐 怕 他 发 怒 ， 你 们 便 在 道 中 灭 亡 ， 因 为 他 的 怒 气 快 要 发 作 。 凡 投 靠 他 的 ， 都 是 有 福 的 。 [kjv] Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him. [bbe] For fear that he may be angry, causing destruction to come on you, because he is quickly moved to wrath. Happy are all those who put their faith in him.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116/1647.html","bookId":182,"book":{"id":182,"title":"诗篇 Psalms","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 不 从 恶 人 的 计 谋 ， 不 站 罪 人 的 道 路 ， 不 坐 亵 慢 人 的 座 位 。 [kjv] Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
