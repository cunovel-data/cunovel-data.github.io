\n [bbe] How long will sinners, O Lord, how long will sinners have joy over us? \n 94:4 [hgb] 他 们 絮 絮 叨 叨 ， 说 傲 慢 的 话 。 一 切 作 孽 的 人 ， 都 自 己 夸 张 。 \n [kjv] How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves? \n [bbe] Words of pride come from their lips; all the workers of evil say great things of themselves. \n 94:5 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 他 们 强 压 你 的 百 姓 ， 苦 害 你 的 产 业 。 \n [kjv] They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage. \n [bbe] Your people are crushed by them, O Lord, your heritage is troubled, \n 94:6 [hgb] 他 们 杀 死 寡 妇 和 寄 居 的 ， 又 杀 害 孤 儿 。 \n [kjv] They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless. \n [bbe] They put to death the widow and the guest, they take the lives of children who have no father; \n 94:7 [hgb] 他 们 说 ， 耶 和 华 必 不 看 见 ， 雅 各 的 神 必 不 思 念 。 \n [kjv] Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it. \n [bbe] And they say, Jah will not see it, the God of Jacob will not give thought to it. \n 94:8 [hgb] 你 们 民 间 的 畜 类 人 当 思 想 。 你 们 愚 顽 人 ， 到 几 时 才 有 智 慧 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise? \n [bbe] Give your mind to my words, you who are without wisdom among the people; you foolish men, when will you be wise? \n 94:9 [hgb] 造 耳 朵 的 ， 难 道 自 己 不 听 见 吗 ？ 造 眼 睛 的 ， 难 道 自 己 不 看 见 吗 ？ \n [kjv] He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see? \n [bbe] Has he by whom your ears were planted no hearing? or is he blind by whom your eyes were formed? \n 94:10 [hgb] 管 教 列 邦 的 ， 就 是 叫 人 得 知 识 的 ， 难 道 自 己 不 惩 治 人 吗 ？ \n [kjv] He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know? \n [bbe] He who is the judge of the nations, will he not give men the reward of their acts, even he who gives knowledge to man? \n 94:11 [hgb] 耶 和 华 知 道 人 的 意 念 是 虚 妄 的 。 \n [kjv] The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity. \n [bbe] The Lord has knowledge of the thoughts of man, for they are only a breath. \n 94:12 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 你 所 管 教 ， 用 律 法 所 教 训 的 人 ， 是 有 福 的 。 \n [kjv] Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law; \n [bbe] Happy is the man who is guided by you, O Jah, and to whom you give teaching out of your law; \n 94:13 [hgb] 你 使 他 在 遭 难 的 日 子 ， 得 享 平 安 。 惟 有 恶 人 陷 在 所 挖 的 坑 中 。 \n [kjv] That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked. \n [bbe] So that you may give him rest from the days of evil, till a hole is made ready for the destruction of the sinners. \n 94:14 [hgb] 因 为 耶 和 华 必 不 丢 弃 他 的 百 姓 ， 也 不 离 弃 他 的 产 业 。 \n [kjv] For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance. \n [bbe] The Lord will not give up his people, or take away his support from his heritage; \n 94:15 [hgb] 审 判 要 转 向 公 义 。 心 里 正 直 的 ， 必 都 随 从 。 \n [kjv] But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it. \n [bbe] But decisions will again be made in righteousness; and they will be kept by all whose hearts are true. \n 94:16 [hgb] 谁 肯 为 我 起 来 攻 击 作 恶 的 。 谁 肯 为 我 站 起 抵 挡 作 孽 的 。 \n [kjv] Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity? \n [bbe] Who will give me help against the sinners? and who will be my support against the workers of evil? \n 94:17 [hgb] 若 不 是 耶 和 华 帮 助 我 ， 我 就 住 在 寂 静 之 中 了 。 \n [kjv] Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence. \n [bbe] If the Lord had not been my helper, my soul would quickly have gone down into death. \n 94:18 [hgb] 我 正 说 我 失 了 脚 ， 耶 和 华 阿 ， 那 时 你 的 慈 爱 扶 助 我 。 \n [kjv] When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up. \n [bbe] If I say, My foot is slipping; your mercy, O Lord, is my support. \n 94:19 [hgb] 我 心 里 多 忧 多 疑 ， 你 安 慰 我 ， 就 使 我 欢 乐 。 \n [kjv] In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul. \n [bbe] Among all my troubled thoughts, your comforts are the delight of my soul. \n 94:20 [hgb] 那 借 着 律 例 架 弄 残 害 ， 在 位 上 行 奸 恶 的 ， 岂 能 与 你 相 交 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law? \n [bbe] What part with you has the seat of sin, which makes evil into a law? \n 94:21 [hgb] 他 们 大 家 聚 集 攻 击 义 人 ， 将 无 辜 的 人 定 为 死 罪 。 \n [kjv] They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood. \n [bbe] They are banded together against the soul of the upright, to give decisions against those who have done no wrong. \n 94:22 [hgb] 但 耶 和 华 向 来 作 了 我 的 高 台 。 我 的 神 作 了 我 投 靠 的 磐 石 。 \n [kjv] But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge. \n [bbe] But the Lord is my safe resting-place; my God is the Rock where I am safe. \n 94:23 [hgb] 他 叫 他 们 的 罪 孽 归 到 他 们 身 上 。 他 们 正 在 行 恶 之 中 ， 他 要 剪 除 他 们 。 耶 和 华 我 们 的 神 要 把 他 们 剪 除 。 \n [kjv] And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall cut them off. \n [bbe] And he has made their evil designs come back on themselves, cutting them off in their sin; the Lord our God will put an end to them. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116/1738.html","bookId":182,"book":{"id":182,"title":"诗篇 Psalms","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 不 从 恶 人 的 计 谋 ， 不 站 罪 人 的 道 路 ， 不 坐 亵 慢 人 的 座 位 。 [kjv] Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
