{"id":5603,"no":54,"title":"Chapter 55","content":"55:1 [hgb] （ 大 卫 的 训 诲 诗 ， 交 与 伶 长 ， 用 丝 弦 的 乐 器 ） 神 阿 ， 求 你 留 心 听 我 的 祷 告 。 不 要 隐 藏 不 听 我 的 恳 求 。 \n [kjv] Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication. \n [bbe] \u003cTo the chief music-maker, on Neginoth. Maschil. Of David.\u003e Give hearing to my prayer, O God; and let not your ear be shut against my request. \n 55:2 [hgb] 求 你 侧 耳 听 我 ， 应 允 我 。 我 哀 叹 不 安 ， 发 声 唉 哼 。 \n [kjv] Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise; \n [bbe] Give thought to me, and let my prayer be answered: I have been made low in sorrow; \n 55:3 [hgb] 都 因 仇 敌 的 声 音 ， 恶 人 的 欺 压 。 因 为 他 们 将 罪 孽 加 在 我 身 上 ， 发 怒 气 逼 迫 我 。 \n [kjv] Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me. \n [bbe] I am troubled because of the voice of the cruel ones, because of the loud cry of the evil-doers; for they put a weight of evil on me, and they are cruel in their hate for me. \n 55:4 [hgb] 我 心 在 我 里 面 甚 是 疼 痛 。 死 的 惊 惶 临 到 我 身 。 \n [kjv] My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me. \n [bbe] My heart is deeply wounded, and the fear of death has come on me. \n 55:5 [hgb] 恐 惧 战 兢 归 到 我 身 ， 惊 恐 漫 过 了 我 。 \n [kjv] Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me. \n [bbe] Fear and shaking have come over me, with deep fear I am covered. \n 55:6 [hgb] 我 说 ， 但 愿 我 有 翅 膀 像 鸽 子 ， 我 就 飞 去 得 享 安 息 。 \n [kjv] And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest. \n [bbe] And I said, If only I had wings like a dove! for then I would go in flight from here and be at rest. \n 55:7 [hgb] 我 必 远 游 宿 在 旷 野 。 （ 细 拉 ） \n [kjv] Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. Selah. \n [bbe] I would go wandering far away, living in the waste land. (Selah.) \n 55:8 [hgb] 我 必 速 速 逃 到 避 所 ， 脱 离 狂 风 暴 雨 。 \n [kjv] I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest. \n [bbe] I would quickly take cover from the driving storm and from the violent wind. \n 55:9 [hgb] 主 阿 ， 求 你 吞 灭 他 们 ， 变 乱 他 们 的 舌 头 。 因 为 我 在 城 中 见 了 强 暴 争 竞 的 事 。 \n [kjv] Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city. \n [bbe] Send destruction on them, O Lord, make a division of tongues among them: for I have seen fighting and violent acts in the town. \n 55:10 [hgb] 他 们 在 城 墙 上 昼 夜 绕 行 。 在 城 内 也 有 罪 孽 和 奸 恶 。 \n [kjv] Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it. \n [bbe] By day and night they go round the town, on the walls; trouble and sorrow are in the heart of it. \n 55:11 [hgb] 邪 恶 在 其 中 ， 欺 压 和 诡 诈 不 离 街 市 。 \n [kjv] Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets. \n [bbe] Evil is there; cruel rule and deceit are ever in the streets. \n 55:12 [hgb] 原 来 不 是 仇 敌 辱 骂 我 。 若 是 仇 敌 ， 还 可 忍 耐 。 也 不 是 恨 我 的 人 向 我 狂 大 。 若 是 恨 我 的 人 ， 就 必 躲 避 他 。 \n [kjv] For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him: \n [bbe] For it was not my hater who said evil of me; that would have been no grief to me; it was not one outside the number of my friends who made himself strong against me, or I would have kept myself from him in a secret place; \n 55:13 [hgb] 不 料 是 你 ， 你 原 与 我 平 等 ， 是 我 的 同 伴 ， 是 我 知 己 的 朋 友 。 \n [kjv] But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance. \n [bbe] But it was you, my equal, my guide, my well-loved friend. \n 55:14 [hgb] 我 们 素 常 彼 此 谈 论 ， 以 为 甘 甜 。 我 们 与 群 众 在 神 的 殿 中 同 行 。 \n [kjv] We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company. \n [bbe] We had loving talk together, and went to the house of God in company. \n 55:15 [hgb] 愿 死 亡 忽 然 临 到 他 们 。 愿 他 们 活 活 地 下 入 阴 间 。 因 为 他 们 的 住 处 ， 他 们 的 心 中 ， 都 是 邪 恶 。 \n [kjv] Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them. \n [bbe] Let the hand of death come on them suddenly, and let them go down living into the underworld; because evil is in their houses and in their hearts. \n 55:16 [hgb] 至 于 我 ， 我 要 求 告 神 。 耶 和 华 必 拯 救 我 。 \n [kjv] As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me. \n [bbe] As for me, I will make my prayer to God, and he will be my saviour. \n 55:17 [hgb] 我 要 晚 上 ， 早 晨 ， 晌 午 ， 哀 声 悲 叹 。 他 也 必 听 我 的 声 音 。 \n [kjv] Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice. \n [bbe] In the evening and in the morning and in the middle of the day I will make my prayer with sounds of grief; and my voice will come to his ears. \n 55:18 [hgb] 他 救 赎 我 命 脱 离 攻 击 我 的 人 ， 使 我 得 享 平 安 。 因 为 与 我 相 争 的 人 甚 多 。 \n [kjv] He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for there were many with me. \n [bbe] He has taken my soul away from the attack which was made against me, and given it peace; for great numbers were against me. \n 55:19 [hgb] 那 没 有 更 变 ， 不 敬 畏 神 的 人 ， 从 太 古 常 存 的 神 ， 必 听 见 而 苦 待 他 。 \n [kjv] God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God. \n [bbe] God will give thought to me; he who from early times is strong will send pain and trouble on them. (Selah.) Because they are unchanged, they have no fear of God. \n 55:20 [hgb] 他 背 了 约 ， 伸 手 攻 击 与 他 和 好 的 人 。 \n [kjv] He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant. \n [bbe] He has put out his hand against those who were at peace with him; he has not kept his agreement. \n 55:21 [hgb] 他 的 口 如 奶 油 光 滑 ， 他 的 心 却 怀 着 争 战 。 他 的 话 比 油 柔 和 ， 其 实 是 拔 出 来 的 刀 。 \n [kjv] The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords. \n [bbe] The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart; his words were softer than oil, but they were sharp swords. \n 55:22 [hgb] 你 要 把 你 的 重 担 卸 给 耶 和 华 ， 他 必 抚 养 你 ， 他 永 不 叫 义 人 动 摇 。 \n [kjv] Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved. \n [bbe] Put your cares on the Lord, and he will be your support; he will not let the upright man be moved. \n 55:23 [hgb] 神 阿 ， 你 必 使 恶 人 下 入 灭 亡 的 坑 。 流 人 血 行 诡 诈 的 人 ， 必 活 不 到 半 世 ， 但 我 要 倚 靠 你 。 \n [kjv] But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee. \n [bbe] But you, O God, will send them down into the underworld; the cruel and the false will be cut off before half their days are ended; but I will have faith in you. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116/1699.html","bookId":182,"book":{"id":182,"title":"诗篇 Psalms","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 不 从 恶 人 的 计 谋 ， 不 站 罪 人 的 道 路 ， 不 坐 亵 慢 人 的 座 位 。 [kjv] Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
