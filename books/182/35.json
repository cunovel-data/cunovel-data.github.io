The saviour of the poor man from the hands of the strong, of him who is poor and in need from him who takes his goods. \n 35:11 [hgb] 凶 恶 的 见 证 人 起 来 ， 盘 问 我 所 不 知 道 的 事 。 \n [kjv] False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that I knew not. \n [bbe] False witnesses got up: they put questions to me about crimes of which I had no knowledge. \n 35:12 [hgb] 他 们 向 我 以 恶 报 善 ， 使 我 的 灵 魂 孤 苦 。 \n [kjv] They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul. \n [bbe] They gave me back evil for good, troubling my soul. \n 35:13 [hgb] 至 于 我 ， 当 他 们 有 病 的 时 候 ， 我 便 穿 麻 衣 ， 禁 食 刻 苦 己 心 。 我 所 求 的 都 归 到 自 己 的 怀 中 。 \n [kjv] But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom. \n [bbe] But as for me, when they were ill I put on the clothing of sorrow: I went without food and was sad, and my prayer came back again to my heart. \n 35:14 [hgb] 我 这 样 行 ， 好 像 他 是 我 的 朋 友 ， 我 的 弟 兄 。 我 屈 身 悲 哀 ， 如 同 人 为 母 亲 哀 痛 。 \n [kjv] I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother. \n [bbe] My behaviour was as if it had been my friend or my brother: I was bent low in grief like one whose mother is dead. \n 35:15 [hgb] 我 在 患 难 中 ， 他 们 却 欢 喜 ， 大 家 聚 集 。 我 所 不 认 识 的 那 些 下 流 人 ， 聚 集 攻 击 我 。 他 们 不 住 地 把 我 撕 裂 。 \n [kjv] But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not: \n [bbe] But they took pleasure in my trouble, and came together, yes, low persons came together against me without my knowledge; they never came to an end of wounding me. \n 35:16 [hgb] 他 们 如 同 席 上 好 嬉 笑 的 狂 妄 人 ， 向 我 咬 牙 。 \n [kjv] With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth. \n [bbe] Like men of deceit they put me to shame; the voice of their wrath was loud against me. \n 35:17 [hgb] 主 阿 ， 你 看 着 不 理 ， 要 到 几 时 呢 ？ 求 你 救 我 的 灵 魂 ， 脱 离 他 们 的 残 害 ， 救 我 的 生 命 ， 脱 离 少 壮 狮 子 。 （ 生 命 原 文 作 独 一 者 ） \n [kjv] Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions. \n [bbe] Lord, how long will you be looking on? take my soul from their destruction, my life from the lions. \n 35:18 [hgb] 我 在 大 会 中 要 称 谢 你 ， 在 众 民 中 要 赞 美 你 。 \n [kjv] I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people. \n [bbe] I will give you praise in the great meeting; I will give you honour among a strong people. \n 35:19 [hgb] 求 你 不 容 那 无 理 与 我 为 仇 的 ， 向 我 夸 耀 。 不 容 那 无 故 恨 我 的 ， 向 我 挤 眼 。 \n [kjv] Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause. \n [bbe] Do not let my haters be glad over me falsely; let not those who are against me without cause make sport of me. \n 35:20 [hgb] 因 为 他 们 不 说 和 平 话 。 倒 想 出 诡 诈 的 言 语 ， 害 地 上 的 安 静 人 。 \n [kjv] For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land. \n [bbe] For they do not say words of peace; in their deceit they are designing evil things against the quiet ones in the land. \n 35:21 [hgb] 他 们 大 大 张 口 攻 击 我 ， 说 ， 阿 哈 ， 阿 哈 ， 我 们 的 眼 已 经 看 见 了 。 \n [kjv] Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it. \n [bbe] Their mouths were open wide against me, and they said, Aha, aha, our eyes have seen it. \n 35:22 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 你 已 经 看 见 了 。 求 你 不 要 闭 口 。 主 阿 ， 求 你 不 要 远 离 我 。 \n [kjv] This thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me. \n [bbe] You have seen this, O Lord; be not unmoved: O Lord, be not far from me. \n 35:23 [hgb] 我 的 神 我 的 主 阿 ， 求 你 奋 兴 醒 起 ， 判 清 我 的 事 ， 伸 明 我 的 冤 。 \n [kjv] Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God and my Lord. \n [bbe] Be awake, O Lord, be moved to take up my cause, my God and my Lord. \n 35:24 [hgb] 耶 和 华 我 的 神 阿 ， 求 你 按 你 的 公 义 判 断 我 ， 不 容 他 们 向 我 夸 耀 。 \n [kjv] Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me. \n [bbe] Be my judge, O Lord my God, in your righteousness; do not let them be glad over me. \n 35:25 [hgb] 不 容 他 们 心 里 说 ， 阿 哈 ， 遂 我 们 的 心 愿 了 。 不 容 他 们 说 ， 我 们 已 经 把 他 吞 了 。 \n [kjv] Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up. \n [bbe] Let them not say in their hearts, So we will have it: let them not say, We have put an end to him. \n 35:26 [hgb] 愿 那 喜 欢 我 遭 难 的 ， 一 同 抱 愧 蒙 羞 。 愿 那 向 我 妄 自 尊 大 的 ， 披 惭 愧 ， 蒙 羞 辱 。 \n [kjv] Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me. \n [bbe] Let all those who take pleasure in my troubles be shamed and come to nothing: let those who are lifted up against me be covered with shame and have no honour. \n 35:27 [hgb] 愿 那 喜 悦 我 冤 屈 得 伸 的 ， （ 冤 屈 得 伸 原 文 作 公 义 ） ， 欢 呼 快 乐 。 愿 他 们 常 说 ， 当 尊 耶 和 华 为 大 。 耶 和 华 喜 悦 他 的 仆 人 平 安 。 \n [kjv] Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant. \n [bbe] Let those who are on my side give cries of joy; let them ever say, The Lord be praised, for he has pleasure in the peace of his servant. \n 35:28 [hgb] 我 的 舌 头 ， 要 终 日 论 说 你 的 公 义 ， 时 常 赞 美 你 。 \n [kjv] And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long. \n [bbe] And my tongue will be talking of your righteousness and of your praise all the day. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116/1680.html","bookId":182,"book":{"id":182,"title":"诗篇 Psalms","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 不 从 恶 人 的 计 谋 ， 不 站 罪 人 的 道 路 ， 不 坐 亵 慢 人 的 座 位 。 [kjv] Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
