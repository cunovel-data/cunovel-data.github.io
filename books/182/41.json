A Psalm. Of David.\u003e Happy is the man who gives thought to the poor; the Lord will be his saviour in the time of trouble. \n 41:2 [hgb] 耶 和 华 必 保 全 他 ， 使 他 存 活 。 他 必 在 地 上 享 福 。 求 你 不 要 把 他 交 给 仇 敌 ， 遂 其 所 愿 。 \n [kjv] The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies. \n [bbe] The Lord will keep him safe, and give him life; the Lord will let him be a blessing on the earth, and will not give him into the hand of his haters. \n 41:3 [hgb] 他 病 重 在 榻 ， 耶 和 华 必 扶 持 他 。 他 在 病 中 ， 你 必 给 他 铺 床 。 \n [kjv] The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness. \n [bbe] The Lord will be his support on his bed of pain: by you will all his grief be turned to strength. \n 41:4 [hgb] 我 曾 说 ， 耶 和 华 阿 ， 求 你 怜 恤 我 ， 医 治 我 。 因 为 我 得 罪 了 你 。 \n [kjv] I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee. \n [bbe] I said, Lord, have mercy on me; make my soul well, because my faith is in you. \n 41:5 [hgb] 我 的 仇 敌 用 恶 言 议 论 我 ， 说 ， 他 几 时 死 ， 他 的 名 才 灭 亡 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish? \n [bbe] My haters say evil against me, When will he be dead, and his name come to an end? \n 41:6 [hgb] 他 来 看 我 ， 就 说 假 话 。 他 心 存 奸 恶 ， 走 到 外 边 才 说 出 来 。 \n [kjv] And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it. \n [bbe] If one comes to see me, deceit is in his heart; he keeps a store of evil, which he makes public in every place. \n 41:7 [hgb] 一 切 恨 我 的 ， 都 交 头 接 耳 的 议 论 我 。 他 们 设 计 要 害 我 。 \n [kjv] All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt. \n [bbe] All my haters are talking secretly together against me; they are designing my downfall. \n 41:8 [hgb] 他 们 说 ， 有 怪 病 贴 在 他 身 上 。 他 已 躺 卧 ， 必 不 能 再 起 来 。 \n [kjv] An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now that he lieth he shall rise up no more. \n [bbe] They say, He has an evil disease, which will not let him go: and now that he is down he will not get up again. \n 41:9 [hgb] 连 我 知 己 的 朋 友 ， 我 所 倚 靠 吃 过 我 饭 的 ， 也 用 脚 踢 我 。 \n [kjv] Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me. \n [bbe] Even my dearest friend, in whom I had faith, who took bread with me, is turned against me. \n 41:10 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 求 你 怜 恤 我 ， 使 我 起 来 ， 好 报 复 他 们 。 \n [kjv] But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them. \n [bbe] But you, O Lord, have mercy on me, lifting me up, so that I may give them their punishment. \n 41:11 [hgb] 因 我 的 仇 敌 不 得 向 我 夸 胜 。 我 从 此 便 知 道 你 喜 爱 我 。 \n [kjv] By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me. \n [bbe] By this I see that you have pleasure in me, because my hater does not overcome me. \n 41:12 [hgb] 你 因 我 纯 正 ， 就 扶 持 我 ， 使 我 永 远 站 在 你 的 面 前 。 \n [kjv] And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever. \n [bbe] And as for me, you are my support in my righteousness, giving me a place before your face for ever. \n 41:13 [hgb] 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 ， 是 应 当 称 颂 的 ， 从 亘 古 直 到 永 远 。 阿 们 ， 阿 们 。 \n [kjv] Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen. \n [bbe] May the Lord God of Israel be praised, through eternal days and for ever. So be it. So be it. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116/1686.html","bookId":182,"book":{"id":182,"title":"诗篇 Psalms","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 不 从 恶 人 的 计 谋 ， 不 站 罪 人 的 道 路 ， 不 坐 亵 慢 人 的 座 位 。 [kjv] Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
