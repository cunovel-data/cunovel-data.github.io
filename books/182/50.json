Of Asaph.\u003e The God of gods, even the Lord, has sent out his voice, and the earth is full of fear; from the coming up of the sun to its going down. \n 50:2 [hgb] 从 全 美 的 锡 安 中 ， 神 已 经 发 光 了 。 \n [kjv] Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined. \n [bbe] From Zion, most beautiful of places, God has sent out his light. \n 50:3 [hgb] 我 们 的 神 要 来 ， 决 不 闭 口 。 有 烈 火 在 他 面 前 吞 灭 ， 有 暴 风 在 他 四 围 大 刮 。 \n [kjv] Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him. \n [bbe] Our God will come, and will not keep quiet; with fire burning before him, and storm-winds round him. \n 50:4 [hgb] 他 招 呼 上 天 下 地 ， 为 要 审 判 他 的 民 ， \n [kjv] He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people. \n [bbe] His voice will go out to the heavens and to the earth, for the judging of his people: \n 50:5 [hgb] 说 ， 招 聚 我 的 圣 民 到 我 这 里 来 ， 就 是 那 些 用 祭 物 与 我 立 约 的 人 。 \n [kjv] Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice. \n [bbe] Let my saints come together to me; those who have made an agreement with me by offerings. \n 50:6 [hgb] 诸 天 必 表 明 他 的 公 义 。 因 为 神 是 施 行 审 判 的 。 （ 细 拉 ） \n [kjv] And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge himself. Selah. \n [bbe] And let the heavens make clear his righteousness; for God himself is the judge. (Selah.) \n 50:7 [hgb] 我 的 民 哪 ， 你 们 当 听 我 的 话 。 以 色 列 阿 ， 我 要 劝 戒 你 。 我 是 神 ， 是 你 的 神 。 \n [kjv] Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I am God, even thy God. \n [bbe] Give ear, O my people, to my words; O Israel, I will be a witness against you; I am God, even your God. \n 50:8 [hgb] 我 并 不 因 你 的 祭 物 责 备 你 。 你 的 燔 祭 常 在 我 面 前 。 \n [kjv] I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, to have been continually before me. \n [bbe] I will not take up a cause against you because of your offerings, or because of your burned offerings, which are ever before me. \n 50:9 [hgb] 我 不 从 你 家 中 取 公 牛 ， 也 不 从 你 圈 内 取 山 羊 。 \n [kjv] I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy folds. \n [bbe] I will take no ox out of your house, or he-goats from your flocks; \n 50:10 [hgb] 因 为 树 林 中 的 百 兽 是 我 的 ， 千 山 上 的 牲 畜 也 是 我 的 。 \n [kjv] For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. \n [bbe] For every beast of the woodland is mine, and the cattle on a thousand hills. \n 50:11 [hgb] 山 中 的 飞 鸟 ， 我 都 知 道 。 野 地 的 走 兽 ， 也 都 属 我 。 \n [kjv] I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine. \n [bbe] I see all the birds of the mountains, and the beasts of the field are mine. \n 50:12 [hgb] 我 若 是 饥 饿 ， 我 不 用 告 诉 你 。 因 为 世 界 ， 和 其 中 所 充 满 的 ， 都 是 我 的 。 \n [kjv] If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof. \n [bbe] If I had need of food, I would not give you word of it; for the earth is mine and all its wealth. \n 50:13 [hgb] 我 岂 吃 公 牛 的 肉 呢 ？ 我 岂 喝 山 羊 的 血 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? \n [bbe] Am I to take the flesh of the ox for my food, or the blood of goats for my drink? \n 50:14 [hgb] 你 们 要 以 感 谢 为 祭 献 与 神 。 又 要 向 至 高 者 还 你 的 愿 。 \n [kjv] Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High: \n [bbe] Make an offering of praise to God; keep the agreements which you have made with the Most High; \n 50:15 [hgb] 并 要 在 患 难 之 日 求 告 我 ， 我 必 搭 救 你 。 你 也 要 荣 耀 我 。 \n [kjv] And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me. \n [bbe] Let your voice come up to me in the day of trouble; I will be your saviour, so that you may give glory to me. \n 50:16 [hgb] 但 神 对 恶 人 说 ， 你 怎 敢 传 说 我 的 律 例 ， 口 中 提 到 我 的 约 呢 ？ \n [kjv] But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth? \n [bbe] But to the sinner, God says, What are you doing, talking of my laws, or taking the words of my agreement in your mouth? \n 50:17 [hgb] 其 实 你 恨 恶 管 教 ， 将 我 的 言 语 丢 在 背 后 。 \n [kjv] Seeing thou hatest instruction, and casteth my words behind thee. \n [bbe] Seeing that you have no desire for my teaching, turning your back on my words. \n 50:18 [hgb] 你 见 了 盗 贼 ， 就 乐 意 与 他 同 伙 ， 又 与 行 奸 淫 的 人 ， 一 同 有 分 。 \n [kjv] When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers. \n [bbe] When you saw a thief, you were in agreement with him, and you were joined with those who took other men\u0027s wives. \n 50:19 [hgb] 你 口 任 说 恶 言 ， 你 舌 编 造 诡 诈 。 \n [kjv] Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit. \n [bbe] You have given your mouth to evil, your tongue to words of deceit. \n 50:20 [hgb] 你 坐 着 毁 谤 你 的 兄 弟 ， 谗 毁 你 亲 母 的 儿 子 。 \n [kjv] Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother\u0027s son. \n [bbe] You say evil of your brother; you make false statements against your mother\u0027s son. \n 50:21 [hgb] 你 行 了 这 些 事 ， 我 还 闭 口 不 言 。 你 想 我 恰 和 你 一 样 。 其 实 我 要 责 备 你 ， 将 这 些 事 摆 在 你 眼 前 。 \n [kjv] These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes. \n [bbe] These things have you done, and I said nothing; it seemed to you that I was such a one as yourself; but I will make a protest against you, and put them in order before your eyes. \n 50:22 [hgb] 你 们 忘 记 神 的 ， 要 思 想 这 事 ， 免 得 我 把 你 们 撕 碎 ， 无 人 搭 救 。 \n [kjv] Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver. \n [bbe] Now keep this in mind, you who have no memory of God, for fear that you may be crushed under my hand, with no one to give you help: \n 50:23 [hgb] 凡 以 感 谢 献 上 为 祭 的 ， 便 是 荣 耀 我 。 那 按 正 路 而 行 的 ， 我 必 使 他 得 着 我 的 救 恩 。 \n [kjv] Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God. \n [bbe] Whoever makes an offering of praise gives glory to me; and to him who is upright in his ways I will make clear the salvation of God. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116/1695.html","bookId":182,"book":{"id":182,"title":"诗篇 Psalms","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 不 从 恶 人 的 计 谋 ， 不 站 罪 人 的 道 路 ， 不 坐 亵 慢 人 的 座 位 。 [kjv] Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
