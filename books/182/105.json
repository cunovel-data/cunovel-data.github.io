O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. \\n\\n [bbe] Let the Lord be praised. O give praise to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy is unchanging for ever. \\n\\n 106:2 [hgb] 谁 能 传 说 耶 和 华 的 大 能 ， 谁 能 表 明 他 一 切 的 美 德 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth all his praise? \\n\\n [bbe] Who is able to give an account of the great acts of the Lord, or to make clear all his praise? \\n\\n 106:3 [hgb] 凡 遵 守 公 平 ， 常 行 公 义 的 ， 这 人 便 为 有 福 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times. \\n\\n [bbe] Happy are they whose decisions are upright, and he who does righteousness at all times. \\n\\n 106:4 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 你 用 恩 惠 待 你 的 百 姓 ， 求 你 也 用 这 恩 惠 记 念 我 ， 开 你 的 救 恩 眷 顾 我 ， \\n\\n [kjv] Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation; \\n\\n [bbe] Keep me in mind, O Lord, when you are good to your people; O let your salvation come to me; \\n\\n 106:5 [hgb] 使 我 见 你 选 民 的 福 ， 乐 你 国 民 的 乐 ， 与 你 的 产 业 一 同 夸 耀 。 \\n\\n [kjv] That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance. \\n\\n [bbe] So that I may see the well-being of the people of your selection, and have a part in the joy of your nation, and take pride in your heritage. \\n\\n 106:6 [hgb] 我 们 与 我 们 的 祖 宗 一 同 犯 罪 。 我 们 作 了 孽 ， 行 了 恶 。 \\n\\n [kjv] We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. \\n\\n [bbe] We are sinners like our fathers, we have done wrong, our acts are evil. \\n\\n 106:7 [hgb] 我 们 的 祖 宗 在 埃 及 不 明 白 你 的 奇 事 ， 不 记 念 你 丰 盛 的 慈 爱 ， 反 倒 在 红 海 行 了 悖 逆 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea. \\n\\n [bbe] Our fathers did not give thought to your wonders in Egypt; they did not keep in memory the great number of your mercies, but gave you cause for wrath at the sea, even at the Red Sea. \\n\\n 106:8 [hgb] 然 而 ， 他 因 自 己 的 名 拯 救 他 们 ， 为 要 彰 显 他 的 大 能 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Nevertheless he saved them for his name\u0027s sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known. \\n\\n [bbe] But he was their saviour because of his name, so that men might see his great power. \\n\\n 106:9 [hgb] 并 且 斥 责 红 海 ， 海 便 干 了 ； 他 带 领 他 们 经 过 深 处 ， 如 同 经 过 旷 野 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness. \\n\\n [bbe] By his word the Red Sea was made dry: and he took them through the deep waters as through the waste land. \\n\\n 106:10 [hgb] 他 拯 救 他 们 脱 离 恨 他 们 人 的 手 ， 从 仇 敌 手 中 救 赎 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. \\n\\n [bbe] And he took them safely out of the hands of their haters, and kept them from the attacks of those who were against them. \\n\\n 106:11 [hgb] 水 淹 没 他 们 的 敌 人 ， 没 有 一 个 存 留 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left. \\n\\n [bbe] And the waters went over their haters; all of them came to an end. \\n\\n 106:12 [hgb] 那 时 ， 他 们 才 信 了 他 的 话 ， 歌 唱 赞 美 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then believed they his words; they sang his praise. \\n\\n [bbe] Then they had faith in his words; they gave him songs of praise. \\n\\n 106:13 [hgb] 等 不 多 时 ， 他 们 就 忘 了 他 的 作 为 ， 不 仰 望 他 的 指 教 ， \\n\\n [kjv] They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel: \\n\\n [bbe] But their memory of his works was short; not waiting to be guided by him, \\n\\n 106:14 [hgb] 反 倒 在 旷 野 大 起 欲 心 ， 在 荒 地 试 探 神 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert. \\n\\n [bbe] They gave way to their evil desires in the waste land, and put God to the test in the dry places. \\n\\n 106:15 [hgb] 他 将 他 们 所 求 的 赐 给 他 们 ， 却 使 他 们 的 心 灵 软 弱 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul. \\n\\n [bbe] And he gave them their request, but sent a wasting disease into their souls. \\n\\n 106:16 [hgb] 他 们 又 在 营 中 嫉 妒 摩 西 ， 和 耶 和 华 的 圣 者 亚 伦 。 \\n\\n [kjv] They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD. \\n\\n [bbe] They were full of envy against Moses among the tents, and against Aaron, the holy one of the Lord. \\n\\n 106:17 [hgb] 地 裂 开 ， 吞 下 大 坍 ， 掩 盖 亚 比 兰 一 党 的 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram. \\n\\n [bbe] The earth opening put an end to Dathan, covering up Abiram and his band. \\n\\n 106:18 [hgb] 有 火 在 他 们 的 党 中 发 起 ， 有 火 焰 烧 毁 了 恶 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked. \\n\\n [bbe] And a fire was lighted among their tents; the sinners were burned up by the flames. \\n\\n 106:19 [hgb] 他 们 在 何 烈 山 造 了 牛 犊 ， 叩 拜 铸 成 的 像 。 \\n\\n [kjv] They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image. \\n\\n [bbe] They made a young ox in Horeb, and gave worship to an image of gold. \\n\\n 106:20 [hgb] 如 此 将 他 们 荣 耀 的 主 ， 换 为 吃 草 之 牛 的 像 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass. \\n\\n [bbe] And their glory was changed into the image of an ox, whose food is grass. \\n\\n 106:21 [hgb] 忘 了 神 他 们 的 救 主 。 他 曾 在 埃 及 行 大 事 。 \\n\\n [kjv] They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt; \\n\\n [bbe] They had no memory of God their saviour, who had done great things in Egypt; \\n\\n 106:22 [hgb] 在 含 地 行 奇 事 ， 在 红 海 行 可 畏 的 事 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea. \\n\\n [bbe] Works of wonder in the land of Ham, and things of fear by the Red Sea. \\n\\n 106:23 [hgb] 所 以 ， 他 说 要 灭 绝 他 们 。 若 非 有 他 所 拣 选 的 摩 西 站 在 当 中 （ 原 文 作 破 口 ） ， 使 他 的 忿 怒 转 消 ， 恐 怕 他 就 灭 绝 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them. \\n\\n [bbe] And he was purposing to put an end to them if Moses, his special servant, had not gone up before him, between him and his people, turning back his wrath, to keep them from destruction. \\n\\n 106:24 [hgb] 他 们 又 藐 视 那 美 地 ， 不 信 他 的 话 ， \\n\\n [kjv] Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word: \\n\\n [bbe] They were disgusted with the good land; they had no belief in his word; \\n\\n 106:25 [hgb] 在 自 己 帐 棚 内 发 怨 言 ， 不 听 耶 和 华 的 声 音 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD. \\n\\n [bbe] Talking against him secretly in their tents, they did not give ear to the voice of the Lord. \\n\\n 106:26 [hgb] 所 以 ， 他 对 他 们 起 誓 ， 必 叫 他 们 倒 在 旷 野 ， \\n\\n [kjv] Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness: \\n\\n [bbe] So he made an oath against them, to put an end to them in the waste land: \\n\\n 106:27 [hgb] 叫 他 们 的 后 裔 倒 在 列 国 之 中 ， 分 散 在 各 地 。 \\n\\n [kjv] To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands. \\n\\n [bbe] That their children might be mixed among the nations, and sent away into other lands. \\n\\n 106:28 [hgb] 他 们 又 与 巴 力 毗 珥 连 合 ， 且 吃 了 祭 死 神 （ 或 作 人 ） 的 物 。 \\n\\n [kjv] They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. \\n\\n [bbe] And they were joined to Baal-peor, and took part in the offerings to the dead. \\n\\n 106:29 [hgb] 他 们 这 样 行 ， 惹 耶 和 华 发 怒 ， 便 有 瘟 疫 流 行 在 他 们 中 间 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them. \\n\\n [bbe] So they made him angry by their behaviour; and he sent disease on them. \\n\\n 106:30 [hgb] 那 时 ， 非 尼 哈 站 起 ， 刑 罚 恶 人 ， 瘟 疫 这 才 止 息 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Phinehas got up, and made prayer for them; and the disease went no farther. \\n\\n 106:31 [hgb] 那 就 算 为 他 的 义 ， 世 世 代 代 ， 直 到 永 远 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore. \\n\\n [bbe] And all the generations coming after him kept the memory of his righteousness for ever. \\n\\n 106:32 [hgb] 他 们 在 米 利 巴 水 又 叫 耶 和 华 发 怒 ， 甚 至 摩 西 也 受 了 亏 损 。 \\n\\n [kjv] They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes: \\n\\n [bbe] They made God angry again at the waters of Meribah, so that Moses was troubled because of them; \\n\\n 106:33 [hgb] 是 因 他 们 惹 动 他 的 灵 ， 摩 西 （ 原 文 作 他 ） 用 嘴 说 了 急 躁 的 话 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips. \\n\\n [bbe] For they made his spirit bitter, and he said unwise things. \\n\\n 106:34 [hgb] 他 们 不 照 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 的 灭 绝 外 邦 人 ， \\n\\n [kjv] They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them: \\n\\n [bbe] They did not put an end to the peoples, as the Lord had said; \\n\\n 106:35 [hgb] 反 与 他 们 混 杂 相 合 ， 学 习 他 们 的 行 为 ， \\n\\n [kjv] But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works. \\n\\n [bbe] But they were joined to the nations, learning their works. \\n\\n 106:36 [hgb] 事 奉 他 们 的 偶 像 ， 这 就 成 了 自 己 的 网 罗 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them. \\n\\n [bbe] And they gave worship to images; which were a danger to them: \\n\\n 106:37 [hgb] 把 自 己 的 儿 女 祭 祀 鬼 魔 ， \\n\\n [kjv] Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils, \\n\\n [bbe] They even made offerings of their sons and their daughters to evil spirits, \\n\\n 106:38 [hgb] 流 无 辜 人 的 血 ， 就 是 自 己 儿 女 的 血 ， 把 他 们 祭 祀 迦 南 的 偶 像 ， 那 地 就 被 血 污 秽 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood. \\n\\n [bbe] And gave the blood of their sons and their daughters who had done no wrong, offering them to the images of Canaan; and the land was made unclean with blood. \\n\\n 106:39 [hgb] 这 样 ， 他 们 被 自 己 所 做 的 污 秽 了 ， 在 行 为 上 犯 了 邪 淫 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions. \\n\\n [bbe] So they became unclean through their works, going after their evil desires. \\n\\n 106:40 [hgb] 所 以 ， 耶 和 华 的 怒 气 ， 向 他 的 百 姓 发 作 ， 憎 恶 他 的 产 业 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance. \\n\\n [bbe] Then the wrath of the Lord was burning against his people, and he was angry with his heritage. \\n\\n 106:41 [hgb] 将 他 们 交 在 外 邦 人 的 手 里 ； 恨 他 们 的 人 就 辖 制 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them. \\n\\n [bbe] And he gave them into the hands of the nations; and they were ruled by their haters. \\n\\n 106:42 [hgb] 他 们 的 仇 敌 也 欺 压 他 们 ， 他 们 就 伏 在 敌 人 手 下 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand. \\n\\n [bbe] By them they were crushed, and made low under their hands. \\n\\n 106:43 [hgb] 他 屡 次 搭 救 他 们 ， 他 们 却 设 谋 背 逆 ， 因 自 己 的 罪 孽 降 为 卑 下 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity. \\n\\n [bbe] Again and again he made them free; but their hearts were turned against his purpose, and they were overcome by their sins. \\n\\n 106:44 [hgb] 然 而 ， 他 听 见 他 们 哀 告 的 时 候 ， 就 眷 顾 他 们 的 急 难 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry: \\n\\n [bbe] But when their cry came to his ears, he had pity on their trouble: \\n\\n 106:45 [hgb] 为 他 们 记 念 他 的 约 ， 照 他 丰 盛 的 慈 爱 后 悔 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies. \\n\\n [bbe] And kept in mind his agreement with them, and in his great mercy gave them forgiveness. \\n\\n 106:46 [hgb] 他 也 使 他 们 在 凡 掳 掠 他 们 的 人 面 前 蒙 怜 恤 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives. \\n\\n [bbe] He put pity into the hearts of those who made them prisoners. \\n\\n 106:47 [hgb] 耶 和 华 我 们 的 神 阿 ， 求 你 拯 救 我 们 ， 从 外 邦 中 招 聚 我 们 ， 我 们 好 称 赞 你 的 圣 名 ， 以 赞 美 你 为 夸 胜 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise. \\n\\n [bbe] Be our saviour, O Lord our God, and let us come back together from among the nations, so that we may give honour to your holy name, and have glory in your praise. \\n\\n 106:48 [hgb] 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 是 应 当 称 颂 的 ， 从 亘 古 直 到 永 远 。 愿 众 民 都 说 ， 阿 们 。 你 们 要 赞 美 耶 和 华 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD. \\n\\n [bbe] Praise be to the Lord God of Israel for ever and for ever; and let all the people say, So be it. Give praise to the Lord. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116/1750.html","bookId":182,"book":{"id":182,"title":"诗篇 Psalms","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 不 从 恶 人 的 计 谋 ， 不 站 罪 人 的 道 路 ， 不 坐 亵 慢 人 的 座 位 。 [kjv] Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
