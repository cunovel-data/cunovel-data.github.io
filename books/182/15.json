Of David.\u003e Lord, who may have a resting-place in your tent, a living-place on your holy hill? \\n\\n 15:2 [hgb] 就 是 行 为 正 直 ， 作 事 公 义 ， 心 里 说 实 话 的 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. \\n\\n [bbe] He who goes on his way uprightly, doing righteousness, and saying what is true in his heart; \\n\\n 15:3 [hgb] 他 不 以 舌 头 谗 谤 人 ， 不 恶 待 朋 友 ， 也 不 随 伙 毁 谤 邻 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour. \\n\\n [bbe] Whose tongue is not false, who does no evil to his friend, and does not take away the good name of his neighbour; \\n\\n 15:4 [hgb] 他 眼 中 藐 视 匪 类 ， 却 尊 重 那 敬 畏 耶 和 华 的 人 。 他 发 了 誓 ， 虽 然 自 己 吃 亏 ， 也 不 更 改 。 \\n\\n [kjv] In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. \\n\\n [bbe] Who gives honour to those who have the fear of the Lord, turning away from him who has not the Lord\u0027s approval. He who takes an oath against himself, and makes no change. \\n\\n 15:5 [hgb] 他 不 放 债 取 利 ， 不 受 贿 赂 以 害 无 辜 。 行 这 些 事 的 人 ， 必 永 不 动 摇 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved. \\n\\n [bbe] He who does not put out his money at interest, or for payment give false decisions against men who have done no wrong. He who does these things will never be moved. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116/1660.html","bookId":182,"book":{"id":182,"title":"诗篇 Psalms","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 不 从 恶 人 的 计 谋 ， 不 站 罪 人 的 道 路 ， 不 坐 亵 慢 人 的 座 位 。 [kjv] Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
