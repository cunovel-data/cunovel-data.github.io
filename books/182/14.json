They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good. [bbe] \u003cTo the chief music-maker. Of David.\u003e The foolish man has said in his heart, God will not do anything. They are unclean, they have done evil works; there is not one who does good. 14:2 [hgb] 耶 和 华 从 天 上 垂 看 世 人 ， 要 看 有 明 白 的 没 有 ， 有 寻 求 神 的 没 有 。 [kjv] The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God. [bbe] The Lord was looking down from heaven on the children of men, to see if there were any who had wisdom, searching after God. 14:3 [hgb] 他 们 都 偏 离 正 路 ， 一 同 变 为 污 秽 。 并 没 有 行 善 的 ， 连 一 个 也 没 有 。 [kjv] They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one. [bbe] They have all gone out of the way together; they are unclean, there is not one who does good, no, not one. 14:4 [hgb] 作 孽 的 都 没 有 知 识 吗 ？ 他 们 吞 吃 我 的 百 姓 ， 如 同 吃 饭 一 样 ， 并 不 求 告 耶 和 华 。 [kjv] Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD. [bbe] Have all the workers of evil no knowledge? they take my people for food as they would take bread; they make no prayer to the Lord. 14:5 [hgb] 他 们 在 那 里 大 大 地 害 怕 ， 因 为 神 在 义 人 的 族 类 中 。 [kjv] There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous. [bbe] Then were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the upright. 14:6 [hgb] 你 们 叫 困 苦 人 的 谋 算 ， 变 为 羞 辱 。 然 而 耶 和 华 是 他 的 避 难 所 。 [kjv] Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is his refuge. [bbe] You have put to shame the thoughts of the poor, but the Lord is his support. 14:7 [hgb] 但 愿 以 色 列 的 救 恩 从 锡 安 而 出 。 耶 和 华 救 回 他 被 掳 的 子 民 ， 那 时 雅 各 要 快 乐 ， 以 色 列 要 欢 喜 。 [kjv] Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad. [bbe] May the salvation of Israel come out of Zion! when the fate of his people is changed by the Lord, Jacob will have joy and Israel will be glad.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116/1659.html","bookId":182,"book":{"id":182,"title":"诗篇 Psalms","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 不 从 恶 人 的 计 谋 ， 不 站 罪 人 的 道 路 ， 不 坐 亵 慢 人 的 座 位 。 [kjv] Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
