{"id":5657,"no":108,"title":"Chapter 109","content":"109:1 [hgb] （ 大 卫 的 诗 ， 交 与 伶 长 。 ） 我 所 赞 美 的 神 阿 ， 求 你 不 要 闭 口 不 言 。 [kjv] Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise; [bbe] \u003cTo the chief music-maker. Of David. A Psalm.\u003e God of my praise, let my prayer be answered; 109:2 [hgb] 因 为 恶 人 的 嘴 ， 和 诡 诈 人 的 口 ， 已 经 张 开 攻 击 我 。 他 们 用 撒 谎 的 舌 头 对 我 说 话 。 [kjv] For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue. [bbe] For the mouth of the sinner is open against me in deceit: his tongue has said false things against me. 109:3 [hgb] 他 们 围 绕 我 ， 说 怨 恨 的 话 ， 又 无 故 地 攻 打 我 。 [kjv] They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause. [bbe] Words of hate are round about me; they have made war against me without cause. 109:4 [hgb] 他 们 与 我 为 敌 以 报 我 爱 。 但 我 专 心 祈 祷 。 [kjv] For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer. [bbe] For my love they give me back hate; but I have given myself to prayer. 109:5 [hgb] 他 们 向 我 以 恶 报 善 ， 以 恨 报 爱 。 [kjv] And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love. [bbe] They have put on me evil for good; hate in exchange for my love. 109:6 [hgb] 愿 你 派 一 个 恶 人 辖 制 他 ， 派 一 个 对 头 站 在 他 右 边 。 [kjv] Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand. [bbe] Put an evil man over him; and let one be placed at his right hand to say evil of him. 109:7 [hgb] 他 受 审 判 的 时 候 ， 愿 他 出 来 担 当 罪 名 。 愿 他 的 祈 祷 反 成 为 罪 。 [kjv] When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin. [bbe] When he is judged, let the decision go against him; and may his prayer become sin. 109:8 [hgb] 愿 他 的 年 日 短 少 。 愿 别 人 得 他 的 职 分 。 [kjv] Let his days be few; and let another take his office. [bbe] Let his life be short; let another take his position of authority. 109:9 [hgb] 愿 他 的 儿 女 为 孤 儿 ， 他 的 妻 子 为 寡 妇 。 [kjv] Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow. [bbe] Let his children have no father, and his wife be made a widow. 109:10 [hgb] 愿 他 的 儿 女 漂 流 讨 饭 ， 从 他 们 荒 凉 之 处 出 来 求 食 。 [kjv] Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places. [bbe] Let his children be wanderers, looking to others for their food; let them be sent away from the company of their friends. 109:11 [hgb] 愿 强 暴 的 债 主 牢 笼 他 一 切 所 有 的 。 愿 外 人 抢 他 劳 碌 得 来 的 。 [kjv] Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour. [bbe] Let his creditor take all his goods; and let others have the profit of his work. 109:12 [hgb] 愿 无 人 向 他 延 绵 施 恩 。 愿 无 人 可 怜 他 的 孤 儿 。 [kjv] Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children. [bbe] Let no man have pity on him, or give help to his children when he is dead. 109:13 [hgb] 愿 他 的 后 人 断 绝 ， 名 字 被 涂 抹 ， 不 传 于 下 代 。 [kjv] Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out. [bbe] Let his seed be cut off; in the coming generation let their name go out of memory. 109:14 [hgb] 愿 他 祖 宗 的 罪 孽 被 耶 和 华 记 念 。 愿 他 母 亲 的 罪 过 不 被 涂 抹 。 [kjv] Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. [bbe] Let the Lord keep in mind the wrongdoing of his fathers; and may the sin of his mother have no forgiveness. 109:15 [hgb] 愿 这 些 罪 常 在 耶 和 华 面 前 ， 使 他 的 名 号 断 绝 于 世 。 [kjv] Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth. [bbe] Let them be ever before the eyes of the Lord, so that the memory of them may be cut off from the earth. 109:16 [hgb] 因 为 他 不 想 施 恩 ， 却 逼 迫 困 苦 穷 乏 的 ， 和 伤 心 的 人 ， 要 把 他 们 治 死 。 [kjv] Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart. [bbe] Because he had no mercy, but was cruel to the low and the poor, designing the death of the broken-hearted. 109:17 [hgb] 他 爱 咒 骂 ， 咒 骂 就 临 到 他 。 他 不 喜 爱 福 乐 ， 福 乐 就 与 他 远 离 。 [kjv] As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him. [bbe] As he took pleasure in cursing, so let it come on him; and as he had no delight in blessing, let it be far from him. 109:18 [hgb] 他 拿 咒 骂 当 衣 服 穿 上 。 这 咒 骂 就 如 水 进 他 里 面 ， 像 油 入 他 的 骨 头 。 [kjv] As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones. [bbe] He put on cursing like a robe, and it has come into his body like water, and into his bones like oil. 109:19 [hgb] 愿 这 咒 骂 当 他 遮 身 的 衣 服 ， 当 他 常 束 的 腰 带 。 [kjv] Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually. [bbe] Let it be to him as a robe which he puts on, let it be like a band which is round him at all times. 109:20 [hgb] 这 就 是 我 对 头 ， 和 用 恶 言 议 论 我 的 人 ， 从 耶 和 华 那 里 所 受 的 报 应 。 [kjv] Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul. [bbe] Let this be the reward given to my haters from the Lord, and to those who say evil of my soul. 109:21 [hgb] 主 耶 和 华 阿 ， 求 你 为 你 的 名 恩 待 我 。 因 你 的 慈 爱 美 好 ， 求 你 搭 救 我 。 [kjv] But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name\u0027s sake: because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me. [bbe] But, O Lord God, give me your help, because of your name; take me out of danger, because your mercy is good. 109:22 [hgb] 因 为 我 困 苦 穷 乏 ， 内 心 受 伤 。 [kjv] For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me. [bbe] For I am poor and in need, and my heart is wounded in me. 109:23 [hgb] 我 如 日 影 渐 渐 偏 斜 而 去 。 我 如 蝗 虫 被 抖 出 来 。 [kjv] I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust. [bbe] I am gone like the shade when it is stretched out: I am forced out of my place like a locust. 109:24 [hgb] 我 因 禁 食 ， 膝 骨 软 弱 ； 我 身 上 的 肉 也 渐 渐 瘦 了 。 [kjv] My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness. [bbe] My knees are feeble for need of food; there is no fat on my bones. 109:25 [hgb] 我 受 他 们 的 羞 辱 。 他 们 看 见 我 ， 便 摇 头 。 [kjv] I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shaked their heads. [bbe] As for me, they make sport of me; shaking their heads when they see me. 109:26 [hgb] 耶 和 华 我 的 神 阿 ， 求 你 帮 助 我 ， 照 你 的 慈 爱 拯 救 我 。 [kjv] Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy: [bbe] Give me help, O Lord my God; in your mercy be my saviour; 109:27 [hgb] 使 他 们 知 道 这 是 你 的 手 ， 是 你 耶 和 华 所 行 的 事 。 [kjv] That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast done it. [bbe] So that they may see that it is the work of your hand; that you, Lord, have done it. 109:28 [hgb] 任 凭 他 们 咒 骂 。 惟 愿 你 赐 福 。 他 们 几 时 起 来 就 必 蒙 羞 ， 你 的 仆 人 却 要 欢 喜 。 [kjv] Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice. [bbe] They may give curses but you give blessing; when they come up against me, put them to shame; but let your servant be glad. 109:29 [hgb] 愿 我 的 对 头 ， 披 戴 羞 辱 。 愿 他 们 以 自 己 的 羞 愧 为 外 袍 遮 身 。 [kjv] Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle. [bbe] Let my haters be clothed with shame, covering themselves with shame as with a robe. 109:30 [hgb] 我 要 用 口 极 力 称 谢 耶 和 华 。 我 要 在 众 人 中 间 赞 美 他 。 [kjv] I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude. [bbe] I will give the Lord great praise with my mouth; yes, I will give praise to him among all the people. 109:31 [hgb] 因 为 他 必 站 在 穷 乏 人 的 右 边 ， 要 救 他 脱 离 审 判 他 灵 魂 的 人 。 [kjv] For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul. [bbe] For he is ever at the right hand of the poor, to take him out of the hands of those who go after his soul.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116/1753.html","bookId":182,"book":{"id":182,"title":"诗篇 Psalms","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 不 从 恶 人 的 计 谋 ， 不 站 罪 人 的 道 路 ， 不 坐 亵 慢 人 的 座 位 。 [kjv] Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
