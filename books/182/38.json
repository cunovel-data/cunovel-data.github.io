[bbe] \u003cA Psalm. Of David. To keep in memory.\u003e O Lord, be not bitter with me in your wrath; let not your hand be on me in the heat of your passion. 38:2 [hgb] 因 为 你 的 箭 射 入 我 身 ， 你 的 手 压 住 我 。 [kjv] For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore. [bbe] For your arrows have gone into my flesh, and I am crushed under the weight of your hand. 38:3 [hgb] 因 你 的 恼 怒 ， 我 的 肉 无 一 完 全 。 因 我 的 罪 过 ， 我 的 骨 头 也 不 安 宁 。 [kjv] There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin. [bbe] My flesh is wasted because of your wrath; and there is no peace in my bones because of my sin. 38:4 [hgb] 我 的 罪 孽 高 过 我 的 头 ， 如 同 重 担 叫 我 担 当 不 起 。 [kjv] For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me. [bbe] For my crimes have gone over my head; they are like a great weight which is more than my strength. 38:5 [hgb] 因 我 的 愚 昧 ， 我 的 伤 发 臭 流 脓 。 [kjv] My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness. [bbe] My wounds are poisoned and evil-smelling, because of my foolish behaviour. 38:6 [hgb] 我 疼 痛 ， 大 大 拳 曲 ， 终 日 哀 痛 。 [kjv] I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long. [bbe] I am troubled, I am made low; I go weeping all the day. 38:7 [hgb] 我 满 腰 是 火 。 我 的 肉 无 一 完 全 。 [kjv] For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh. [bbe] For my body is full of burning; all my flesh is unhealthy. 38:8 [hgb] 我 被 压 伤 ， 身 体 疲 倦 。 因 心 里 不 安 ， 我 就 唉 哼 。 [kjv] I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart. [bbe] I am feeble and crushed down; I gave a cry like a lion because of the grief in my heart. 38:9 [hgb] 主 阿 ， 我 的 心 愿 都 在 你 面 前 。 我 的 叹 息 不 向 你 隐 瞒 。 [kjv] Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee. [bbe] Lord, all my desire is before you; my sorrow is not kept secret from you. 38:10 [hgb] 我 心 跳 动 ， 我 力 衰 微 ， 连 我 眼 中 的 光 ， 也 没 有 了 。 [kjv] My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me. [bbe] My heart goes out in pain, my strength is wasting away; as for the light of my eyes, it is gone from me. 38:11 [hgb] 我 的 良 朋 密 友 ， 因 我 的 灾 病 ， 都 躲 在 旁 边 站 着 。 我 的 亲 戚 本 家 ， 也 远 远 地 站 立 。 [kjv] My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off. [bbe] My lovers and my friends keep away from my disease; my relations keep far away. 38:12 [hgb] 那 寻 索 我 命 的 ， 设 下 网 罗 。 那 想 要 害 我 的 ， 口 出 恶 言 ， 终 日 思 想 诡 计 。 [kjv] They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long. [bbe] Those who have a desire to take my life put nets for me; those who are designing my destruction say evil things against me, all the day their minds are full of deceit. 38:13 [hgb] 但 我 如 聋 子 不 听 ， 像 哑 巴 不 开 口 。 [kjv] But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth. [bbe] But I kept my ears shut like a man without hearing; like a man without a voice, never opening his mouth. 38:14 [hgb] 我 如 不 听 见 的 人 ， 口 中 没 有 回 话 。 [kjv] Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs. [bbe] So I was like a man whose ears are shut, and in whose mouth there are no sharp words. 38:15 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 我 仰 望 你 。 主 我 的 神 阿 ， 你 必 应 允 我 。 [kjv] For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God. [bbe] In you, O Lord, is my hope: you will give me an answer, O Lord, my God. 38:16 [hgb] 我 曾 说 ， 恐 怕 他 们 向 我 夸 耀 。 我 失 脚 的 时 候 ， 他 们 向 我 夸 大 。 [kjv] For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me. [bbe] I said, Let them not be glad over me; when my foot is moved, let them not be lifted up with pride against me. 38:17 [hgb] 我 几 乎 跌 倒 ， 我 的 痛 苦 常 在 我 面 前 。 [kjv] For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me. [bbe] My feet are near to falling, and my sorrow is ever before me. 38:18 [hgb] 我 要 承 认 我 的 罪 孽 。 我 要 因 我 的 罪 忧 愁 。 [kjv] For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin. [bbe] I will make clear my wrongdoing, with sorrow in my heart for my sin. 38:19 [hgb] 但 我 的 仇 敌 又 活 泼 又 强 壮 。 无 理 恨 我 的 增 多 了 。 [kjv] But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied. [bbe] But they are strong who have hate for me without cause: those who are against me falsely are increased in numbers. 38:20 [hgb] 以 恶 报 善 的 与 我 作 对 ， 因 我 是 追 求 良 善 。 [kjv] They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is. [bbe] They give me back evil for good; they are my haters because I go after the thing which is right. 38:21 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 求 你 不 要 撇 弃 我 。 我 的 神 阿 ， 求 你 不 要 远 离 我 。 [kjv] Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me. [bbe] Do not give me up, O Lord; O my God, be near to me. 38:22 [hgb] 拯 救 我 的 主 阿 ， 求 你 快 快 帮 助 我 。 [kjv] Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation. [bbe] Come quickly to give me help, O Lord, my salvation.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116/1683.html","bookId":182,"book":{"id":182,"title":"诗篇 Psalms","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 不 从 恶 人 的 计 谋 ， 不 站 罪 人 的 道 路 ， 不 坐 亵 慢 人 的 座 位 。 [kjv] Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
