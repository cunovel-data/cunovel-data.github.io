I will not fear: what can man do unto me? \n [bbe] The Lord is on my side; I will have no fear: what is man able to do to me? \n 118:7 [hgb] 在 那 帮 助 我 的 人 中 ， 有 耶 和 华 帮 助 我 ， 所 以 我 要 看 见 那 恨 我 的 人 遭 报 。 \n [kjv] The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me. \n [bbe] The Lord is my great helper: I will see my desire against my haters. \n 118:8 [hgb] 投 靠 耶 和 华 ， 强 似 倚 赖 人 。 \n [kjv] It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man. \n [bbe] It is better to have faith in the Lord than to put one\u0027s hope in man. \n 118:9 [hgb] 投 靠 耶 和 华 ， 强 似 倚 赖 王 子 。 \n [kjv] It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes. \n [bbe] It is better to have faith in the Lord than to put one\u0027s hope in rulers. \n 118:10 [hgb] 万 民 围 绕 我 。 我 靠 耶 和 华 的 名 ， 必 剿 灭 他 们 。 \n [kjv] All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them. \n [bbe] All the nations have come round me; but in the name of the Lord I will have them cut down. \n 118:11 [hgb] 他 们 环 绕 我 ， 围 困 我 。 我 靠 耶 和 华 的 名 ， 必 剿 灭 他 们 。 \n [kjv] They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them. \n [bbe] They are round me, yes, they are all about me; but in the name of the Lord I will have them cut down. \n 118:12 [hgb] 他 们 如 同 蜂 子 围 绕 我 ， 好 像 烧 荆 棘 的 火 ， 必 被 熄 灭 。 我 靠 耶 和 华 的 名 ， 必 剿 灭 他 们 。 \n [kjv] They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them. \n [bbe] They are round me like bees; but they are put out like a fire among thorns; for in the name of the Lord I will have them cut down. \n 118:13 [hgb] 你 推 我 ， 要 叫 我 跌 倒 ， 但 耶 和 华 帮 助 了 我 。 \n [kjv] Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me. \n [bbe] I have been hard pushed by you, so that I might have a fall: but the Lord was my helper. \n 118:14 [hgb] 耶 和 华 是 我 的 力 量 ， 是 我 的 诗 歌 。 他 也 成 了 我 的 拯 救 。 \n [kjv] The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation. \n [bbe] The Lord is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation. \n 118:15 [hgb] 在 义 人 的 帐 棚 里 ， 有 欢 呼 拯 救 的 声 音 。 耶 和 华 的 右 手 施 展 大 能 。 \n [kjv] The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly. \n [bbe] The sound of joy and salvation is in the tents of the upright; the right hand of the Lord does works of power. \n 118:16 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 右 手 高 举 。 耶 和 华 的 右 手 施 展 大 能 。 \n [kjv] The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly. \n [bbe] The right hand of the Lord is lifted up; the right hand of the Lord does works of power. \n 118:17 [hgb] 我 必 不 至 死 ， 仍 要 存 活 ， 并 要 传 扬 耶 和 华 的 作 为 。 \n [kjv] I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD. \n [bbe] Life and not death will be my part, and I will give out the story of the works of the Lord. \n 118:18 [hgb] 耶 和 华 虽 严 严 地 惩 治 我 ， 却 未 曾 将 我 交 于 死 亡 。 \n [kjv] The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death. \n [bbe] The hand of Jah has been hard on me; but he has not given me up to death. \n 118:19 [hgb] 给 我 敞 开 义 门 。 我 要 进 去 称 谢 耶 和 华 。 \n [kjv] Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the LORD: \n [bbe] Let the doors of righteousness be open to me; I will go in and give praise to the Lord. \n 118:20 [hgb] 这 是 耶 和 华 的 门 。 义 人 要 进 去 。 \n [kjv] This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter. \n [bbe] This is the door of the Lord\u0027s house; the workers of righteousness will go in through it. \n 118:21 [hgb] 我 要 称 谢 你 ， 因 为 你 已 经 应 允 我 ， 又 成 了 我 的 拯 救 。 \n [kjv] I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation. \n [bbe] I will give you praise, for you have given me an answer, and have become my salvation. \n 118:22 [hgb] 匠 人 所 弃 的 石 头 ， 已 成 了 房 角 的 头 块 石 头 。 \n [kjv] The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner. \n [bbe] The stone which the builders put on one side has become the chief stone of the building. \n 118:23 [hgb] 这 是 耶 和 华 所 做 的 ， 在 我 们 眼 中 看 为 希 奇 。 \n [kjv] This is the LORD\u0027s doing; it is marvellous in our eyes. \n [bbe] This is the Lord\u0027s doing; it is a wonder in our eyes. \n 118:24 [hgb] 这 是 耶 和 华 所 定 的 日 子 。 我 们 在 其 中 要 高 兴 欢 喜 。 \n [kjv] This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it. \n [bbe] This is the day which the Lord has made; we will be full of joy and delight in it. \n 118:25 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 求 你 拯 救 。 耶 和 华 阿 ， 求 你 使 我 们 亨 通 。 \n [kjv] Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send now prosperity. \n [bbe] Send salvation now, O Lord; Lord, send us your blessing. \n 118:26 [hgb] 奉 耶 和 华 名 来 的 ， 是 应 当 称 颂 的 。 我 们 从 耶 和 华 的 殿 中 ， 为 你 们 祝 福 。 \n [kjv] Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD. \n [bbe] A blessing be on him who comes in the name of the Lord; we give you blessing from the house of the Lord. \n 118:27 [hgb] 耶 和 华 是 神 。 他 光 照 了 我 们 。 理 当 用 绳 索 把 祭 牲 拴 住 ， 牵 到 坛 角 那 里 。 \n [kjv] God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar. \n [bbe] The Lord is God, and he has given us light; let the holy dance be ordered with branches, even up to the horns of the altar. \n 118:28 [hgb] 你 是 我 的 神 ， 我 要 称 谢 你 。 你 是 我 的 神 ， 我 要 尊 崇 你 。 \n [kjv] Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee. \n [bbe] You are my God, and I will give you praise; my God, and I will give honour to your name. \n 118:29 [hgb] 你 们 要 称 谢 耶 和 华 ， 因 他 本 为 善 。 他 的 慈 爱 永 远 长 存 。 \n [kjv] O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. \n [bbe] O give praise to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy is unchanging for ever. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116/1762.html","bookId":182,"book":{"id":182,"title":"诗篇 Psalms","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 不 从 恶 人 的 计 谋 ， 不 站 罪 人 的 道 路 ， 不 坐 亵 慢 人 的 座 位 。 [kjv] Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
