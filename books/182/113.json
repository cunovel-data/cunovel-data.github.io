[bbe] Judah became his holy place, and Israel his kingdom. 114:3 [hgb] 沧 海 看 见 就 奔 逃 。 约 旦 河 也 倒 流 。 [kjv] The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back. [bbe] The sea saw it, and went in flight; Jordan was turned back. 114:4 [hgb] 大 山 踊 跃 ， 如 公 羊 。 小 山 跳 舞 ， 如 羊 羔 。 [kjv] The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs. [bbe] The mountains were jumping like goats, and the little hills like lambs. 114:5 [hgb] 沧 海 阿 ， 你 为 何 奔 逃 。 约 旦 哪 ， 你 为 何 倒 流 。 [kjv] What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back? [bbe] What was wrong with you, O sea, that you went in flight? O Jordan, that you were turned back? 114:6 [hgb] 大 山 哪 ， 你 为 何 踊 跃 ， 如 公 羊 。 小 山 哪 ， 你 为 何 跳 舞 ， 如 羊 羔 。 [kjv] Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs? [bbe] You mountains, why were you jumping like goats, and you little hills like lambs? 114:7 [hgb] 大 地 阿 ， 你 因 见 主 的 面 ， 就 是 雅 各 神 的 面 ， 便 要 震 动 。 [kjv] Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob; [bbe] Be troubled, O earth, before the Lord, before the God of Jacob; 114:8 [hgb] 他 叫 磐 石 变 为 水 池 ， 叫 坚 石 变 为 泉 源 。 [kjv] Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters. [bbe] Who made the rock into a water-spring, and the hard stone into a fountain.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116/1758.html","bookId":182,"book":{"id":182,"title":"诗篇 Psalms","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 不 从 恶 人 的 计 谋 ， 不 站 罪 人 的 道 路 ， 不 坐 亵 慢 人 的 座 位 。 [kjv] Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
