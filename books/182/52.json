Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good. \n [bbe] \u003cTo the chief music-maker; put to Mahalath. Maschil. Of David.\u003e The foolish man has said in his heart, God will not do anything. They are unclean, they have done evil works; there is not one who does good. \n 53:2 [hgb] 神 从 天 上 垂 看 世 人 ， 要 看 有 明 白 的 没 有 ， 有 寻 求 他 的 没 有 。 \n [kjv] God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God. \n [bbe] God was looking down from heaven on the children of men, to see if there were any who had wisdom, searching after God. \n 53:3 [hgb] 他 们 各 人 都 退 后 ， 一 同 变 为 污 秽 。 并 没 有 行 善 的 。 连 一 个 也 没 有 。 \n [kjv] Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. \n [bbe] Every one of them has gone back; they are unclean: there is not one who does good, no, not one. \n 53:4 [hgb] 作 孽 的 没 有 知 识 吗 ？ 他 们 吞 吃 我 的 百 姓 如 同 吃 饭 一 样 。 并 不 求 告 神 。 \n [kjv] Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread: they have not called upon God. \n [bbe] Have the workers of evil no knowledge? they take my people for food, as they would take bread; they make no prayer to God. \n 53:5 [hgb] 他 们 在 无 可 惧 怕 之 处 ， 就 大 大 害 怕 。 因 为 神 把 那 安 营 攻 击 你 之 人 的 骨 头 散 开 了 。 你 使 他 们 蒙 羞 ， 因 为 神 弃 绝 了 他 们 。 \n [kjv] There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them. \n [bbe] They were in great fear, where there was no cause for fear: for the bones of those who make war on you have been broken by God; you have put them to shame, because God has no desire for them. \n 53:6 [hgb] 但 愿 以 色 列 的 救 恩 从 锡 安 而 出 。 神 救 回 他 被 掳 的 子 民 ， 那 时 ， 雅 各 要 快 乐 ， 以 色 列 要 欢 喜 。 \n [kjv] Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad. \n [bbe] May the salvation of Israel come out of Zion! When the fate of his people is changed by God, Jacob will have joy, and Israel will be glad. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116/1697.html","bookId":182,"book":{"id":182,"title":"诗篇 Psalms","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 不 从 恶 人 的 计 谋 ， 不 站 罪 人 的 道 路 ， 不 坐 亵 慢 人 的 座 位 。 [kjv] Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
