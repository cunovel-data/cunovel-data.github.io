Of David.\u003e If it had not been the Lord who was on our side (let Israel now say); 124:2 [hgb] 若 不 是 耶 和 华 帮 助 我 们 ， 当 人 起 来 攻 击 我 们 ， [kjv] If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us: [bbe] If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men came up against us; 124:3 [hgb] 向 我 们 发 怒 的 时 候 ， 就 把 我 们 活 活 地 吞 了 。 [kjv] Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us: [bbe] They would have made a meal of us while still living, in the heat of their wrath against us: 124:4 [hgb] 那 时 ， 波 涛 必 漫 过 我 们 ， 河 水 必 淹 没 我 们 。 [kjv] Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul: [bbe] We would have been covered by the waters; the streams would have gone over our soul; 124:5 [hgb] 狂 傲 的 水 必 淹 没 我 们 。 [kjv] Then the proud waters had gone over our soul. [bbe] Yes, the waters of pride would have gone over our soul. 124:6 [hgb] 耶 和 华 是 应 当 称 颂 的 。 他 没 有 把 我 们 当 野 食 交 给 他 们 吞 吃 （ 原 文 作 牙 齿 ） 。 [kjv] Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth. [bbe] Praise be to the Lord, who has not let us be wounded by their teeth. 124:7 [hgb] 我 们 好 像 雀 鸟 ， 从 捕 鸟 人 的 网 罗 里 逃 脱 。 网 罗 破 裂 ， 我 们 逃 脱 了 。 [kjv] Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped. [bbe] Our soul has gone free like a bird out of the net of those who would take her: the net is broken, and we are free. 124:8 [hgb] 我 们 得 帮 助 ， 是 在 乎 倚 靠 造 天 地 之 耶 和 华 的 名 。 [kjv] Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
