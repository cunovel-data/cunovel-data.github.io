{"id":5598,"no":49,"title":"Chapter 49","content":"49:1 [hgb] （ 可 拉 后 裔 的 诗 ， 交 与 伶 长 。 ） 万 民 哪 ， 你 们 都 当 听 这 话 ， 世 上 一 切 的 居 民 ， [kjv] Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world: [bbe] \u003cAlamoth. To the chief music-maker. Of the sons of Korah. A Psalm.\u003e Give attention to this, all you peoples; let your ears be open, all you who are living in the world. 49:2 [hgb] 无 论 上 流 下 流 ， 富 足 贫 穷 ， 都 当 留 心 听 。 [kjv] Both low and high, rich and poor, together. [bbe] High and low together, the poor, and those who have wealth. 49:3 [hgb] 我 口 要 说 智 慧 的 言 语 。 我 心 要 想 通 达 的 道 理 。 [kjv] My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding. [bbe] From my mouth will come words of wisdom; and in the thoughts of my heart will be knowledge. 49:4 [hgb] 我 要 侧 耳 听 比 喻 ， 用 琴 解 谜 语 。 [kjv] I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp. [bbe] I will put my teaching into a story; I will make my dark sayings clear with music. 49:5 [hgb] 在 患 难 的 日 子 ， 奸 恶 随 我 脚 跟 ， 四 面 环 绕 我 ， 我 何 必 惧 怕 。 [kjv] Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about? [bbe] What cause have I for fear in the days of evil, when the evil-doing of those who are working for my downfall is round about me? 49:6 [hgb] 那 些 倚 仗 财 货 自 夸 钱 财 多 的 人 ， [kjv] They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches; [bbe] Even of those whose faith is in their wealth, and whose hearts are lifted up because of their stores. 49:7 [hgb] 一 个 也 无 法 赎 自 己 的 弟 兄 ， 也 不 能 替 他 将 赎 价 给 神 ， [kjv] None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him: [bbe] Truly, no man may get back his soul for a price, or give to God the payment for himself; 49:8 [hgb] 叫 他 长 远 活 着 ， 不 见 朽 坏 。 因 为 赎 他 生 命 的 价 值 极 贵 ， 只 可 永 远 罢 休 。 [kjv] (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:) [bbe] (Because it takes a great price to keep his soul from death, and man is not able to give it.) 49:9 [hgb] [kjv] That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption. [bbe] So that he might have eternal life, and never see the underworld. 49:10 [hgb] 他 必 见 智 慧 人 死 。 又 见 愚 顽 人 和 畜 类 人 ， 一 同 灭 亡 ， 将 他 们 的 财 货 留 给 别 人 。 [kjv] For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others. [bbe] For he sees that wise men come to their end, and foolish persons of low behaviour come to destruction together, letting their wealth go to others. 49:11 [hgb] 他 们 心 里 思 想 ， 他 们 的 家 室 必 永 存 ， 住 宅 必 留 到 万 代 。 他 们 以 自 己 的 名 ， 称 自 己 的 地 。 [kjv] Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names. [bbe] The place of the dead is their house for ever, and their resting-place through all generations; those who come after them give their names to their lands. 49:12 [hgb] 但 人 居 尊 贵 中 不 能 长 久 ， 如 同 死 亡 的 畜 类 一 样 。 [kjv] Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish. [bbe] But man, like the animals, does not go on for ever; he comes to an end like the beasts. 49:13 [hgb] 他 们 行 的 这 道 ， 本 为 自 己 的 愚 昧 。 但 他 们 以 后 的 人 ， 还 佩 服 他 们 的 话 语 。 （ 细 拉 ） 。 [kjv] This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah. [bbe] This is the way of the foolish; their silver is for those who come after them, and their children get the pleasure of their gold. (Selah.) 49:14 [hgb] 他 们 如 同 羊 群 派 定 下 阴 间 。 死 亡 必 作 他 们 的 牧 者 。 到 了 早 晨 ， 正 直 人 必 管 辖 他 们 。 他 们 的 美 容 ， 必 被 阴 间 所 灭 ， 以 致 无 处 可 存 。 [kjv] Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling. [bbe] Death will give them their food like sheep; the underworld is their fate and they will go down into it; their flesh is food for worms; their form is wasted away; the underworld is their resting-place for ever. 49:15 [hgb] 只 是 神 必 救 赎 我 的 灵 魂 ， 脱 离 阴 间 的 权 柄 ， 因 他 必 收 纳 我 。 （ 细 拉 ） [kjv] But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah. [bbe] But God will get back my soul; for he will take me from the power of death. (Selah.) 49:16 [hgb] 见 人 发 财 家 室 增 荣 的 时 候 ， 你 不 要 惧 怕 。 [kjv] Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased; [bbe] Have no fear when wealth comes to a man, and the glory of his house is increased; 49:17 [hgb] 因 为 他 死 的 时 候 ， 什 么 也 不 能 带 去 。 他 的 荣 耀 不 能 随 他 下 去 。 [kjv] For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him. [bbe] For at his death, he will take nothing away; his glory will not go down after him. 49:18 [hgb] 他 活 着 的 时 候 ， 虽 然 自 夸 为 有 福 ， （ 你 若 利 己 ， 人 必 夸 奖 你 ） 。 [kjv] Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself. [bbe] Though he might have pride in his soul in his life-time, and men will give you praise if you do well for yourself, 49:19 [hgb] 他 仍 必 归 到 他 历 代 的 祖 宗 那 里 ， 永 不 见 光 。 [kjv] He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light. [bbe] He will go to the generation of his fathers; he will not see the light again. 49:20 [hgb] 人 在 尊 贵 中 ， 而 不 醒 悟 ， 就 如 死 亡 的 畜 类 一 样 。 [kjv] Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish. [bbe] Man, like the animals, does not go on for ever; he comes to an end like the beasts.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116/1694.html","bookId":182,"book":{"id":182,"title":"诗篇 Psalms","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 不 从 恶 人 的 计 谋 ， 不 站 罪 人 的 道 路 ， 不 坐 亵 慢 人 的 座 位 。 [kjv] Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
