{"id":5621,"no":72,"title":"Chapter 73","content":"73:1 [hgb] （ 亚 萨 的 诗 。 ） 神 实 在 恩 待 以 色 列 那 些 清 心 的 人 。 [kjv] Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart. [bbe] Truly, God is good to Israel, even to such as are clean in heart. 73:2 [hgb] 至 于 我 ， 我 的 脚 几 乎 失 闪 。 我 的 脚 险 些 滑 跌 。 [kjv] But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped. [bbe] But as for me, my feet had almost gone from under me; I was near to slipping; 73:3 [hgb] 我 见 恶 人 和 狂 傲 人 享 平 安 ， 就 心 怀 不 平 。 [kjv] For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. [bbe] Because of my envy of the men of pride, when I saw the well-being of the wrongdoers. 73:4 [hgb] 他 们 死 的 时 候 ， 没 有 疼 痛 。 他 们 的 力 气 ， 却 也 壮 实 。 [kjv] For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm. [bbe] For they have no pain; their bodies are fat and strong. 73:5 [hgb] 他 们 不 像 别 人 受 苦 ， 也 不 像 别 人 遭 灾 。 [kjv] They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men. [bbe] They are not in trouble as others are; they have no part in the unhappy fate of men. 73:6 [hgb] 所 以 骄 傲 如 链 子 戴 在 他 们 的 项 上 。 强 暴 像 衣 裳 遮 住 他 们 的 身 体 。 [kjv] Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment. [bbe] For this reason pride is round them like a chain; they are clothed with violent behaviour as with a robe. 73:7 [hgb] 他 们 的 眼 睛 ， 因 体 胖 而 凸 出 。 他 们 所 得 的 ， 过 于 心 里 所 想 的 。 [kjv] Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish. [bbe] Their eyes are bursting with fat; they have more than their heart\u0027s desire. 73:8 [hgb] 他 们 讥 笑 人 ， 凭 恶 意 说 欺 压 人 的 话 。 他 们 说 话 自 高 。 [kjv] They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily. [bbe] Their thoughts are deep with evil designs; their talk from their seats of power is of cruel acts. 73:9 [hgb] 他 们 的 口 亵 渎 上 天 ， 他 们 的 舌 毁 谤 全 地 。 [kjv] They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth. [bbe] Their mouth goes up to heaven; their tongues go walking through the earth. 73:10 [hgb] 所 以 神 的 民 归 到 这 里 ， 喝 尽 了 满 杯 的 苦 水 。 [kjv] Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them. [bbe] For this reason they are full of bread; and water is ever flowing for them. 73:11 [hgb] 他 们 说 ， 神 怎 能 晓 得 ？ 至 高 者 岂 有 知 识 呢 ？ [kjv] And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High? [bbe] And they say, How will the Lord see this? is there knowledge in the Most High? 73:12 [hgb] 看 哪 ， 这 就 是 恶 人 。 他 们 既 是 常 享 安 逸 ， 财 宝 便 加 增 。 [kjv] Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches. [bbe] Truly, such are the sinners; they do well at all times, and their wealth is increased. 73:13 [hgb] 我 实 在 徒 然 洁 净 了 我 的 心 ， 徒 然 洗 手 表 明 无 辜 。 [kjv] Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency. [bbe] As for me, I have made my heart clean to no purpose, washing my hands in righteousness; 73:14 [hgb] 因 为 我 终 日 遭 灾 难 ， 每 早 晨 受 惩 治 。 [kjv] For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning. [bbe] For I have been troubled all the day; every morning have I undergone punishment. 73:15 [hgb] 我 若 说 ， 我 要 这 样 讲 ， 这 就 是 以 奸 诈 待 你 的 众 子 。 [kjv] If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children. [bbe] If I would make clear what it is like, I would say, You are false to the generation of your children. 73:16 [hgb] 我 思 索 怎 能 明 白 这 事 ， 眼 看 实 系 为 难 。 [kjv] When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me; [bbe] When my thoughts were turned to see the reason of this, it was a weariness in my eyes; 73:17 [hgb] 等 我 进 了 神 的 圣 所 ， 思 想 他 们 的 结 局 。 [kjv] Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end. [bbe] Till I went into God\u0027s holy place, and saw the end of the evil-doers. 73:18 [hgb] 你 实 在 把 他 们 安 在 滑 地 ， 使 他 们 掉 在 沉 沦 之 中 。 [kjv] Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction. [bbe] You put their feet where there was danger of slipping, so that they go down into destruction. 73:19 [hgb] 他 们 转 眼 之 间 ， 成 了 何 等 的 荒 凉 。 他 们 被 惊 恐 灭 尽 了 。 [kjv] How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors. [bbe] How suddenly are they wasted! fears are the cause of their destruction. 73:20 [hgb] 人 睡 醒 了 怎 样 看 梦 ， 主 阿 ， 你 醒 了 ， 也 必 照 样 轻 看 他 们 的 影 像 。 [kjv] As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image. [bbe] As a dream when one is awake, they are ended; they are like an image gone out of mind when sleep is over. 73:21 [hgb] 因 而 我 心 里 发 酸 ， 肺 腑 被 刺 。 [kjv] Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins. [bbe] My heart was made bitter, and I was pained by the bite of grief: 73:22 [hgb] 我 这 样 愚 昧 无 知 ， 在 你 面 前 如 畜 类 一 般 。 [kjv] So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee. [bbe] As for me, I was foolish, and without knowledge; I was like a beast before you. 73:23 [hgb] 然 而 我 常 与 你 同 在 。 你 搀 着 我 的 右 手 。 [kjv] Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand. [bbe] But still I am ever with you; you have taken me by my right hand. 73:24 [hgb] 你 要 以 你 的 训 言 引 导 我 ， 以 后 必 接 我 到 荣 耀 里 。 [kjv] Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory. [bbe] Your wisdom will be my guide, and later you will put me in a place of honour. 73:25 [hgb] 除 你 以 外 ， 在 天 上 我 有 谁 呢 ？ 除 你 以 外 ， 在 地 上 我 也 没 有 所 爱 慕 的 。 [kjv] Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee. [bbe] Whom have I in heaven but you? and having you I have no desire for anything on earth. 73:26 [hgb] 我 的 肉 体 ， 和 我 的 心 肠 衰 残 。 但 神 是 我 心 里 的 力 量 ， 又 是 我 的 福 分 ， 直 到 永 远 。 [kjv] My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever. [bbe] My flesh and my heart are wasting away: but God is the Rock of my heart and my eternal heritage. 73:27 [hgb] 远 离 你 的 ， 必 要 死 亡 。 凡 离 弃 你 行 邪 淫 的 ， 你 都 灭 绝 了 。 [kjv] For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee. [bbe] For those who are far away from you will come to destruction: you will put an end to all those who have not kept faith with you. 73:28 [hgb] 但 我 亲 近 神 是 与 我 有 益 。 我 以 主 耶 和 华 为 我 的 避 难 所 ， 好 叫 我 述 说 你 一 切 的 作 为 。 [kjv] But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works. [bbe] But it is good for me to come near to God: I have put my faith in the Lord God, so that I may make clear all his works.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116/1717.html","bookId":182,"book":{"id":182,"title":"诗篇 Psalms","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 不 从 恶 人 的 计 谋 ， 不 站 罪 人 的 道 路 ， 不 坐 亵 慢 人 的 座 位 。 [kjv] Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
