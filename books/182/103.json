O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty. \n [bbe] Give praise to the Lord, O my soul. O Lord my God, you are very great; you are robed with honour and power. \n 104:2 [hgb] 披 上 亮 光 ， 如 披 外 袍 ， 铺 张 穹 苍 ， 如 铺 幔 子 。 \n [kjv] Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain: \n [bbe] You are clothed with light as with a robe; stretching out the heavens like a curtain: \n 104:3 [hgb] 在 水 中 立 楼 阁 的 栋 梁 ， 用 云 彩 为 车 辇 ， 借 着 风 的 翅 膀 而 行 。 \n [kjv] Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind: \n [bbe] The arch of your house is based on the waters; you make the clouds your carriage; you go on the wings of the wind: \n 104:4 [hgb] 以 风 为 使 者 ， 以 火 焰 为 仆 役 。 \n [kjv] Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire: \n [bbe] He makes winds his angels, and flames of fire his servants. \n 104:5 [hgb] 将 地 立 在 根 基 上 ， 使 地 永 不 动 摇 。 \n [kjv] Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever. \n [bbe] He has made the earth strong on its bases, so that it may not be moved for ever and ever; \n 104:6 [hgb] 你 用 深 水 遮 盖 地 面 ， 犹 如 衣 裳 。 诸 水 高 过 山 岭 。 \n [kjv] Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains. \n [bbe] Covering it with the sea as with a robe: the waters were high over the mountains; \n 104:7 [hgb] 你 的 斥 责 一 发 ， 水 便 奔 逃 。 你 的 雷 声 一 发 ， 水 便 奔 流 。 \n [kjv] At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away. \n [bbe] At the voice of your word they went in flight; at the sound of your thunder they went away in fear; \n 104:8 [hgb] （ 诸 山 升 上 ， 诸 谷 沉 下 （ 或 作 随 山 上 翻 ， 随 谷 下 流 ） ） ， 归 你 为 它 所 安 定 之 地 \n [kjv] They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them. \n [bbe] The mountains came up and the valleys went down into the place which you had made ready for them. \n 104:9 [hgb] 你 定 了 界 限 ， 使 水 不 能 过 去 ， 不 再 转 回 遮 盖 地 面 。 \n [kjv] Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth. \n [bbe] You made a limit over which they might not go, so that the earth would never again be covered by them. \n 104:10 [hgb] 耶 和 华 使 泉 源 涌 在 山 谷 ， 流 在 山 间 。 \n [kjv] He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills. \n [bbe] You sent the springs into the valleys; they are flowing between the hills. \n 104:11 [hgb] 使 野 地 的 走 兽 有 水 喝 ， 野 驴 得 解 其 渴 。 \n [kjv] They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst. \n [bbe] They give drink to every beast of the field; the mountain asses come to them for water. \n 104:12 [hgb] 天 上 的 飞 鸟 在 水 旁 住 宿 ， 在 树 枝 上 啼 叫 。 \n [kjv] By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches. \n [bbe] The birds of the air have their resting-places by them, and make their song among the branches. \n 104:13 [hgb] 他 从 楼 阁 中 浇 灌 山 岭 。 因 他 作 为 的 功 效 ， 地 就 丰 足 。 \n [kjv] He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works. \n [bbe] He sends down rain from his store-houses on the hills: the earth is full of the fruit of his works. \n 104:14 [hgb] 他 使 草 生 长 ， 给 六 畜 吃 。 使 菜 蔬 发 长 ， 供 给 人 用 。 使 人 从 地 里 能 得 食 物 。 \n [kjv] He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth; \n [bbe] He makes the grass come up for the cattle, and plants for the use of man; so that bread may come out of the earth; \n 104:15 [hgb] 又 得 酒 能 悦 人 心 ， 得 油 能 润 人 面 ， 得 粮 能 养 人 心 。 \n [kjv] And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man\u0027s heart. \n [bbe] And wine to make glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face shining, and bread giving strength to his heart. \n 104:16 [hgb] 佳 美 的 树 木 ， 就 是 利 巴 嫩 的 香 柏 树 ， 是 耶 和 华 所 栽 种 的 ， 都 满 了 汁 浆 。 \n [kjv] The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted; \n [bbe] The trees of the Lord are full of growth, the cedars of Lebanon of his planting; \n 104:17 [hgb] 雀 鸟 在 其 上 搭 窝 。 至 于 鹤 ， 松 树 是 它 的 房 屋 。 \n [kjv] Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house. \n [bbe] Where the birds have their resting-places; as for the stork, the tall trees are her house. \n 104:18 [hgb] 高 山 为 野 山 羊 的 住 所 。 岩 石 为 沙 番 的 藏 处 。 \n [kjv] The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies. \n [bbe] The high hills are a safe place for the mountain goats, and the rocks for the small beasts. \n 104:19 [hgb] 你 安 置 月 亮 为 定 节 令 。 日 头 自 知 沉 落 。 \n [kjv] He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down. \n [bbe] He made the moon for a sign of the divisions of the year; teaching the sun the time of its going down. \n 104:20 [hgb] 你 造 黑 暗 为 夜 ， 林 中 的 百 兽 就 都 爬 出 来 。 \n [kjv] Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth. \n [bbe] When you make it dark, it is night, when all the beasts of the woods come quietly out of their secret places. \n 104:21 [hgb] 少 壮 狮 子 吼 叫 ， 要 抓 食 ， 向 神 寻 求 食 物 。 \n [kjv] The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God. \n [bbe] The young lions go thundering after their food; searching for their meat from God. \n 104:22 [hgb] 日 头 一 出 ， 兽 便 躲 避 ， 卧 在 洞 里 。 \n [kjv] The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens. \n [bbe] The sun comes up, and they come together, and go back to their secret places to take their rest. \n 104:23 [hgb] 人 出 去 做 工 ， 劳 碌 直 到 晚 上 。 \n [kjv] Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening. \n [bbe] Man goes out to his work, and to his business, till the evening. \n 104:24 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 你 所 造 的 何 其 多 ， 都 是 你 用 智 慧 造 成 的 。 遍 地 满 了 你 的 丰 富 。 \n [kjv] O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches. \n [bbe] O Lord, how great is the number of your works! in wisdom you have made them all; the earth is full of the things you have made. \n 104:25 [hgb] 那 里 有 海 ， 又 大 又 广 。 其 中 有 无 数 的 动 物 。 大 小 活 物 都 有 。 \n [kjv] So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts. \n [bbe] There is the great, wide sea, where there are living things, great and small, more than may be numbered. \n 104:26 [hgb] 那 里 有 船 行 走 。 有 你 所 造 的 鳄 鱼 游 泳 在 其 中 。 \n [kjv] There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein. \n [bbe] There go the ships; there is that great beast, which you have made as a plaything. \n 104:27 [hgb] 这 都 仰 望 你 按 时 给 它 食 物 。 \n [kjv] These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season. \n [bbe] All of them are waiting for you, to give them their food in its time. \n 104:28 [hgb] 你 给 它 们 ， 它 们 便 拾 起 来 ； 你 张 手 ， 它 们 饱 得 美 食 。 \n [kjv] That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good. \n [bbe] They take what you give them; they are full of the good things which come from your open hand. \n 104:29 [hgb] 你 掩 面 ， 它 们 便 惊 惶 。 你 收 回 它 们 的 气 ， 它 们 就 死 亡 ， 归 于 尘 土 。 \n [kjv] Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust. \n [bbe] If your face is veiled, they are troubled; when you take away their breath, they come to an end, and go back to the dust. \n 104:30 [hgb] 你 发 出 你 的 灵 ， 它 们 便 受 造 。 你 使 地 面 更 换 为 新 。 \n [kjv] Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth. \n [bbe] If you send out your spirit, they are given life; you make new the face of the earth. \n 104:31 [hgb] 愿 耶 和 华 的 荣 耀 存 到 永 远 。 愿 耶 和 华 喜 悦 自 己 所 造 的 。 \n [kjv] The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works. \n [bbe] Let the glory of the Lord be for ever; let the Lord have joy in his works: \n 104:32 [hgb] 他 看 地 ， 地 便 震 动 。 他 摸 山 ， 山 就 冒 烟 。 \n [kjv] He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke. \n [bbe] At whose look the earth is shaking; at whose touch the mountains send out smoke. \n 104:33 [hgb] 我 要 一 生 向 耶 和 华 唱 诗 。 我 还 活 的 时 候 ， 要 向 我 神 歌 颂 。 \n [kjv] I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being. \n [bbe] I will make songs to the Lord all my life; I will make melody to my God while I have my being. \n 104:34 [hgb] 愿 他 以 我 的 默 念 为 甘 甜 。 我 要 因 耶 和 华 欢 喜 。 \n [kjv] My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD. \n [bbe] Let my thoughts be sweet to him: I will be glad in the Lord. \n 104:35 [hgb] 愿 罪 人 从 世 上 消 灭 。 愿 恶 人 归 于 无 有 。 我 的 心 哪 ， 要 称 颂 耶 和 华 。 你 们 要 赞 美 耶 和 华 。 （ 原 文 作 哈 利 路 亚 下 同 ） \n [kjv] Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD. \n [bbe] Let sinners be cut off from the earth, and let all evil-doers come to an end. Give praise to the Lord, O my soul. Give praise to the Lord. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116/1748.html","bookId":182,"book":{"id":182,"title":"诗篇 Psalms","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 不 从 恶 人 的 计 谋 ， 不 站 罪 人 的 道 路 ， 不 坐 亵 慢 人 的 座 位 。 [kjv] Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
