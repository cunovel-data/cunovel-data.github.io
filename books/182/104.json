[bbe] O give praise to the Lord; give honour to his name, talking of his doings among the peoples. 105:2 [hgb] 要 向 他 唱 诗 歌 颂 ， 谈 论 他 一 切 奇 妙 的 作 为 。 [kjv] Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works. [bbe] Let your voice be sounding in songs and melody; let all your thoughts be of the wonder of his works. 105:3 [hgb] 要 以 他 的 圣 名 夸 耀 。 寻 求 耶 和 华 的 人 ， 心 中 应 当 欢 喜 。 [kjv] Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD. [bbe] Have glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who are searching after the Lord be glad. 105:4 [hgb] 要 寻 求 耶 和 华 与 他 的 能 力 ， 时 常 寻 求 他 的 面 。 [kjv] Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore. [bbe] Let your search be for the Lord and for his strength; let your hearts ever be turned to him. 105:5 [hgb] 他 仆 人 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 后 裔 ， 他 所 拣 选 雅 各 的 子 孙 哪 ， 你 们 要 记 念 他 奇 妙 的 作 为 和 他 的 奇 事 ， 并 他 口 中 的 判 语 。 [kjv] Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; [bbe] Keep in mind the great works which he has done; his wonders, and the decisions of his mouth; 105:6 [hgb] [kjv] O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen. [bbe] O you seed of Abraham, his servant, you children of Jacob, his loved ones. 105:7 [hgb] 他 是 耶 和 华 我 们 的 神 。 全 地 都 有 他 的 判 断 。 [kjv] He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth. [bbe] He is the Lord our God: he is judge of all the earth. 105:8 [hgb] 他 记 念 他 的 约 ， 直 到 永 远 ， 他 所 吩 咐 的 话 ， 直 到 千 代 。 [kjv] He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations. [bbe] He has kept his agreement in mind for ever, the word which he gave for a thousand generations; 105:9 [hgb] 就 是 与 亚 伯 拉 罕 所 立 的 约 ， 向 以 撒 所 起 的 誓 。 [kjv] Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac; [bbe] The agreement which he made with Abraham, and his oath to Isaac; 105:10 [hgb] 他 又 将 这 约 向 雅 各 定 为 律 例 ， 向 以 色 列 定 为 永 远 的 约 ， [kjv] And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant: [bbe] And he gave it to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an eternal agreement; 105:11 [hgb] 说 ， 我 必 将 迦 南 地 赐 给 你 ， 作 你 产 业 的 分 。 [kjv] Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance: [bbe] Saying, To you will I give the land of Canaan, the measured line of your heritage: 105:12 [hgb] 当 时 ， 他 们 人 丁 有 限 ， 数 目 稀 少 ， 并 且 在 那 地 为 寄 居 的 。 [kjv] When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it. [bbe] When they were still small in number, and strange in the land; 105:13 [hgb] 他 们 从 这 邦 游 到 那 邦 ， 从 这 国 行 到 那 国 。 [kjv] When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people; [bbe] When they went about from one nation to another, and from one kingdom to another people. 105:14 [hgb] 他 不 容 什 么 人 欺 负 他 们 ， 为 他 们 的 缘 故 责 备 君 王 ， [kjv] He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes; [bbe] He would not let anyone do them wrong; he even kept back kings because of them, 105:15 [hgb] 说 ， 不 可 难 为 我 受 膏 的 人 ， 也 不 可 恶 待 我 的 先 知 。 [kjv] Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. [bbe] Saying, Put not your hand on those who have been marked with my holy oil, and do my prophets no wrong. 105:16 [hgb] 他 命 饥 荒 降 在 那 地 上 ， 将 所 倚 靠 的 粮 食 全 行 断 绝 。 [kjv] Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread. [bbe] And he took away all food from the land, so that the people were without bread. 105:17 [hgb] 在 他 们 以 先 打 发 一 个 人 去 。 约 瑟 被 卖 为 奴 仆 。 [kjv] He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant: [bbe] He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was given as a servant for a price: 105:18 [hgb] 人 用 脚 镣 伤 他 的 脚 ， 他 被 铁 链 捆 拘 。 [kjv] Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron: [bbe] His feet were fixed in chains; his neck was put in iron bands; 105:19 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 话 试 炼 他 ， 直 等 到 他 所 说 的 应 验 了 。 [kjv] Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him. [bbe] Till the time when his word came true; he was tested by the word of the Lord. 105:20 [hgb] 王 打 发 人 把 他 解 开 ， 就 是 治 理 众 民 的 ， 把 他 释 放 。 [kjv] The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free. [bbe] The king sent men to take off his chains; even the ruler of the people, who let him go free. 105:21 [hgb] 立 他 作 王 家 之 主 ， 掌 管 他 一 切 所 有 的 。 [kjv] He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance: [bbe] He made him lord of his house, and ruler over everything he had; 105:22 [hgb] 使 他 随 意 捆 绑 他 的 臣 宰 ， 将 智 慧 教 导 他 的 长 老 。 [kjv] To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom. [bbe] To give his chiefs teaching at his pleasure, and so that his law-givers might get wisdom from him. 105:23 [hgb] 以 色 列 也 到 了 埃 及 ， 雅 各 在 含 地 寄 居 。 [kjv] Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. [bbe] Then Israel came into Egypt, and Jacob was living in the land of Ham. 105:24 [hgb] 耶 和 华 使 他 的 百 姓 生 养 众 多 ， 使 他 们 比 敌 人 强 盛 。 [kjv] And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies. [bbe] And his people were greatly increased, and became stronger than those who were against them. 105:25 [hgb] 使 敌 人 的 心 转 去 恨 他 的 百 姓 ， 并 用 诡 计 待 他 的 仆 人 。 [kjv] He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants. [bbe] Their hearts were turned to hate against his people, so that they made secret designs against them. 105:26 [hgb] 他 打 发 他 的 仆 人 摩 西 ， 和 他 所 拣 选 的 亚 伦 。 [kjv] He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen. [bbe] He sent Moses, his servant, and Aaron, the man of his selection. 105:27 [hgb] 在 敌 人 中 间 显 他 的 神 迹 ， 在 含 地 显 他 的 奇 事 。 [kjv] They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham. [bbe] He let his signs be seen among the people, and his wonders in the land of Ham. 105:28 [hgb] 他 命 黑 暗 ， 就 有 黑 暗 。 没 有 违 背 他 话 的 。 [kjv] He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word. [bbe] He sent black night and made it dark; and they did not go against his word. 105:29 [hgb] 他 叫 埃 及 的 水 变 为 血 ， 叫 他 们 的 鱼 死 了 。 [kjv] He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish. [bbe] At his word their waters were turned to blood, and he sent death on all their fish. 105:30 [hgb] 在 他 们 的 地 上 ， 以 及 王 宫 的 内 室 ， 青 蛙 多 多 滋 生 。 [kjv] Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings. [bbe] Their land was full of frogs, even in the rooms of the king. 105:31 [hgb] 他 说 一 声 ， 苍 蝇 就 成 群 而 来 ， 并 有 虱 子 进 入 他 们 四 境 。 [kjv] He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts. [bbe] He gave the word, and there came the dog-fly, and insects over all the land. 105:32 [hgb] 他 给 他 们 降 下 冰 雹 为 雨 ， 在 他 们 的 地 上 降 下 火 焰 。 [kjv] He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land. [bbe] He gave them ice for rain, and flaming fire in their land. 105:33 [hgb] 他 也 击 打 他 们 的 葡 萄 树 和 无 花 果 树 ， 毁 坏 他 们 境 内 的 树 木 。 [kjv] He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts. [bbe] He gave their vines and their fig-trees to destruction, and the trees of their land were broken down. 105:34 [hgb] 他 说 一 声 ， 就 有 蝗 虫 蚂 蚱 上 来 ， 不 计 其 数 ， [kjv] He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number, [bbe] At his word the locusts came, and young locusts more than might be numbered, 105:35 [hgb] 吃 尽 了 他 们 地 上 各 样 的 菜 蔬 ， 和 田 地 的 出 产 。 [kjv] And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground. [bbe] And put an end to all the plants of their land, taking all the fruit of the earth for food. 105:36 [hgb] 他 又 击 杀 他 们 国 内 一 切 的 长 子 ， 就 是 他 们 强 壮 时 头 生 的 。 [kjv] He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength. [bbe] He put to death the first child of every family in the land, the first-fruits of their strength. 105:37 [hgb] 他 领 自 己 的 百 姓 带 银 子 金 子 出 来 。 他 支 派 中 没 有 一 个 软 弱 的 。 [kjv] He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes. [bbe] He took his people out with silver and gold: there was not one feeble person among them. 105:38 [hgb] 他 们 出 来 的 时 候 ， 埃 及 人 便 欢 喜 。 原 来 埃 及 人 惧 怕 他 们 。 [kjv] Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them. [bbe] Egypt was glad when they went; for the fear of them had come down on them. 105:39 [hgb] 他 铺 张 云 彩 当 遮 盖 ， 夜 间 使 火 光 照 。 [kjv] He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night. [bbe] A cloud was stretched over them for a cover; and he sent fire to give light in the night. 105:40 [hgb] 他 们 一 求 ， 他 就 使 鹌 鹑 飞 来 ， 并 用 天 上 的 粮 食 ， 叫 他 们 饱 足 。 [kjv] The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. [bbe] At the people\u0027s request he sent birds, and gave them the bread of heaven for food. 105:41 [hgb] 他 打 开 磐 石 ， 水 就 涌 出 。 在 干 旱 之 处 ， 水 流 成 河 。 [kjv] He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river. [bbe] His hand made the rock open, and the waters came streaming out; they went down through the dry places like a river. 105:42 [hgb] 这 都 因 他 记 念 他 的 圣 言 ， 和 他 的 仆 人 亚 伯 拉 罕 。 [kjv] For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant. [bbe] For he kept in mind his holy word, and Abraham, his servant. 105:43 [hgb] 他 带 领 百 姓 欢 乐 而 出 ， 带 领 选 民 欢 呼 前 往 。 [kjv] And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness: [bbe] And he took his people out with joy, the men of his selection with glad cries: 105:44 [hgb] 他 将 列 国 的 地 赐 给 他 们 ， 他 们 便 承 受 众 民 劳 碌 得 来 的 。 [kjv] And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people; [bbe] And gave them the lands of the nations; and they took the work of the peoples for a heritage; 105:45 [hgb] 好 使 他 们 遵 他 的 律 例 ， 守 他 的 律 法 。 你 们 要 赞 美 耶 和 华 。 [kjv] That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD. [bbe] So that they might keep his orders, and be true to his laws. Give praise to the Lord.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116/1749.html","bookId":182,"book":{"id":182,"title":"诗篇 Psalms","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 不 从 恶 人 的 计 谋 ， 不 站 罪 人 的 道 路 ， 不 坐 亵 慢 人 的 座 位 。 [kjv] Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
