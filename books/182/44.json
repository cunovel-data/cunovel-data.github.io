Of the sons of Korah Maschil.\u003e It has come to our ears, O God, our fathers have given us the story, of the works which you did in their days, in the old times, \n 44:2 [hgb] 你 曾 用 手 赶 出 外 邦 人 ， 却 栽 培 了 我 们 列 祖 。 你 苦 待 列 邦 ， 却 叫 我 们 列 祖 发 达 。 \n [kjv] How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out. \n [bbe] Uprooting the nations with your hand, and planting our fathers in their place; cutting down the nations, but increasing the growth of your people. \n 44:3 [hgb] 因 为 他 们 不 是 靠 自 己 的 刀 剑 得 地 土 ， 也 不 是 靠 自 己 的 膀 臂 得 胜 。 乃 是 靠 你 的 右 手 ， 你 的 膀 臂 ， 和 你 脸 上 的 亮 光 ， 因 为 你 喜 悦 他 们 。 \n [kjv] For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them. \n [bbe] For they did not make the land theirs by their swords, and it was not their arms which kept them safe; but your right hand, and your arm, and the light of your face, because you had pleasure in them. \n 44:4 [hgb] 神 阿 ， 你 是 我 的 王 ， 求 你 出 令 ， 使 雅 各 得 胜 。 \n [kjv] Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob. \n [bbe] You are my King and my God; ordering salvation for Jacob. \n 44:5 [hgb] 我 们 靠 你 要 推 倒 我 们 的 敌 人 。 靠 你 的 名 要 践 踏 那 起 来 攻 击 我 们 的 人 。 \n [kjv] Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us. \n [bbe] Through you will we overcome our haters; by your name will they be crushed under our feet who are violent against us. \n 44:6 [hgb] 因 为 我 必 不 靠 我 的 弓 ， 我 的 刀 也 不 能 使 我 得 胜 。 \n [kjv] For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me. \n [bbe] I will not put faith in my bow, my sword will not be my salvation. \n 44:7 [hgb] 惟 你 救 了 我 们 脱 离 敌 人 ， 使 恨 我 们 的 人 羞 愧 。 \n [kjv] But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us. \n [bbe] But it is you who have been our saviour from those who were against us, and have put to shame those who had hate for us. \n 44:8 [hgb] 我 们 终 日 因 神 夸 耀 ， 还 要 永 远 称 谢 你 的 名 。 （ 细 拉 ） \n [kjv] In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah. \n [bbe] Our pride is in God at all times, to his name we give praise for ever. (Selah.) \n 44:9 [hgb] 但 如 今 你 丢 弃 了 我 们 ， 使 我 们 受 辱 ， 不 和 我 们 的 军 兵 同 去 。 \n [kjv] But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies. \n [bbe] But now you have sent us away from you, and put us to shame; you do not go out with our armies. \n 44:10 [hgb] 你 使 我 们 向 敌 人 转 身 退 后 。 那 恨 我 们 的 人 任 意 抢 夺 。 \n [kjv] Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves. \n [bbe] Because of this we are turned back by the attacker: those who have hate for us take our goods for themselves. \n 44:11 [hgb] 你 使 我 们 当 作 快 要 被 吃 的 羊 ， 把 我 们 分 散 在 列 邦 中 。 \n [kjv] Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen. \n [bbe] You have made us like sheep which are taken for meat; we are put to flight among the nations. \n 44:12 [hgb] 你 卖 了 你 的 子 民 ， 也 不 赚 利 。 所 得 的 价 值 ， 并 不 加 添 你 的 资 财 。 \n [kjv] Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy wealth by their price. \n [bbe] You let your people go for nothing; your wealth is not increased by their price. \n 44:13 [hgb] 你 使 我 们 受 邻 国 的 羞 辱 ， 被 四 围 的 人 嗤 笑 讥 刺 。 \n [kjv] Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us. \n [bbe] You have made us to be looked down on by our neighbours, we are laughed at and shamed by those who are round about us. \n 44:14 [hgb] 你 使 我 们 在 列 邦 中 作 了 笑 谈 ， 使 众 民 向 我 们 摇 头 。 \n [kjv] Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people. \n [bbe] Our name is a word of shame among the nations, a sign for the shaking of heads among the peoples. \n 44:15 [hgb] 我 的 凌 辱 ， 终 日 在 我 面 前 。 我 脸 上 的 羞 愧 ， 将 我 遮 蔽 。 \n [kjv] My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me, \n [bbe] My downfall is ever before me, and I am covered with the shame of my face; \n 44:16 [hgb] 都 因 那 辱 骂 毁 谤 人 的 声 音 ， 又 因 仇 敌 和 报 仇 人 的 缘 故 。 \n [kjv] For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger. \n [bbe] Because of the voice of him who says sharp and bitter words; because of the hater and him who is the instrument of punishment. \n 44:17 [hgb] 这 都 临 到 我 们 身 上 。 我 们 却 没 有 忘 记 你 。 也 没 有 违 背 你 的 约 。 \n [kjv] All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant. \n [bbe] All this has come on us, but still we have kept you in our memory; and we have not been false to your word. \n 44:18 [hgb] 我 们 的 心 没 有 退 后 ， 我 们 的 脚 也 没 有 偏 离 你 的 路 。 \n [kjv] Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way; \n [bbe] Our hearts have not gone back, and our steps have not been turned out of your way; \n 44:19 [hgb] 你 在 野 狗 之 处 压 伤 我 们 ， 用 死 荫 遮 蔽 我 们 。 \n [kjv] Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death. \n [bbe] Though you have let us be crushed in the place of jackals, though we are covered with darkest shade. \n 44:20 [hgb] 倘 若 我 们 忘 了 神 的 名 ， 或 向 别 神 举 手 ， \n [kjv] If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god; \n [bbe] If the name of our God has gone out of our minds, or if our hands have been stretched out to a strange god, \n 44:21 [hgb] 神 岂 不 鉴 察 这 事 吗 ？ 因 为 他 晓 得 人 心 里 的 隐 秘 。 \n [kjv] Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart. \n [bbe] Will not God make search for it? for he sees the secrets of the heart. \n 44:22 [hgb] 我 们 为 你 的 缘 故 终 日 被 杀 ， 人 看 我 们 如 将 宰 的 羊 。 \n [kjv] Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter. \n [bbe] Truly, because of you we are put to death every day; we are numbered like sheep for destruction. \n 44:23 [hgb] 主 阿 ， 求 你 睡 醒 ， 为 何 尽 睡 呢 ？ 求 你 兴 起 ， 不 要 永 远 丢 弃 我 们 。 \n [kjv] Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever. \n [bbe] Why are you sleeping, O Lord? awake! and come to our help, do not give us up for ever. \n 44:24 [hgb] 你 为 何 掩 面 ， 不 顾 我 们 所 遭 的 苦 难 ， 和 所 受 的 欺 压 。 \n [kjv] Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression? \n [bbe] Why is your face covered, and why do you give no thought to our trouble and our cruel fate? \n 44:25 [hgb] 我 们 的 性 命 伏 于 尘 土 。 我 们 的 肚 腹 紧 贴 地 面 。 \n [kjv] For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth. \n [bbe] For our souls are crushed down to the dust: our bodies are stretched out on the earth. \n 44:26 [hgb] 求 你 起 来 帮 助 我 们 ， 凭 你 的 慈 爱 救 赎 我 们 。 \n [kjv] Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies\u0027 sake. \n [bbe] Up! and come to our help, and give us salvation because of your mercy. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116/1689.html","bookId":182,"book":{"id":182,"title":"诗篇 Psalms","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 不 从 恶 人 的 计 谋 ， 不 站 罪 人 的 道 路 ， 不 坐 亵 慢 人 的 座 位 。 [kjv] Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
