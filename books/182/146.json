{"id":5695,"no":146,"title":"Chapter 147","content":"147:1 [hgb] 你 们 要 赞 美 耶 和 华 ， 因 歌 颂 我 们 的 神 为 善 为 美 。 赞 美 的 话 是 合 宜 的 。 [kjv] Praise ye the LORD: for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely. [bbe] Give praise to the Lord; for it is good to make melody to our God; praise is pleasing and beautiful. 147:2 [hgb] 耶 和 华 建 造 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 聚 集 以 色 列 中 被 赶 散 的 人 。 [kjv] The LORD doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel. [bbe] The Lord is building up Jerusalem; he makes all the outlaws of Israel come together. 147:3 [hgb] 他 医 好 伤 心 的 人 ， 裹 好 他 们 的 伤 处 。 [kjv] He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds. [bbe] He makes the broken-hearted well, and puts oil on their wounds. 147:4 [hgb] 他 数 点 星 宿 的 数 目 ， 一 一 称 它 的 名 。 [kjv] He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names. [bbe] He sees the number of the stars; he gives them all their names. 147:5 [hgb] 我 们 的 主 为 大 ， 最 有 能 力 。 他 的 智 慧 无 法 测 度 。 [kjv] Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is infinite. [bbe] Great is our Lord, and great his power; there is no limit to his wisdom. 147:6 [hgb] 耶 和 华 扶 持 谦 卑 人 ， 将 恶 人 倾 覆 于 地 。 [kjv] The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the ground. [bbe] The Lord gives help to the poor in spirit; but he sends sinners down in shame. 147:7 [hgb] 你 们 要 以 感 谢 向 耶 和 华 歌 唱 ， 用 琴 向 我 们 的 神 歌 颂 。 [kjv] Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God: [bbe] Make songs of praise to the Lord; make melody to our God with instruments of music. 147:8 [hgb] 他 用 云 遮 天 ， 为 地 降 雨 ， 使 草 生 长 在 山 上 。 [kjv] Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains. [bbe] By his hand the heaven is covered with clouds and rain is stored up for the earth; he makes the grass tall on the mountains. 147:9 [hgb] 他 赐 食 给 走 兽 ， 和 啼 叫 的 小 乌 鸦 。 [kjv] He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry. [bbe] He gives food to every beast, and to the young ravens in answer to their cry. 147:10 [hgb] 他 不 喜 悦 马 的 力 大 ， 不 喜 爱 人 的 腿 快 。 [kjv] He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man. [bbe] He has no delight in the strength of a horse; he takes no pleasure in the legs of a man. 147:11 [hgb] 耶 和 华 喜 爱 敬 畏 他 和 盼 望 他 慈 爱 的 人 。 [kjv] The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy. [bbe] The Lord takes pleasure in his worshippers, and in those whose hope is in his mercy. 147:12 [hgb] 耶 路 撒 冷 阿 ， 你 要 颂 赞 耶 和 华 。 锡 安 哪 ， 你 要 赞 美 你 的 神 。 [kjv] Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion. [bbe] Give praise to the Lord, O Jerusalem; give praise to your God, O Zion. 147:13 [hgb] 因 为 他 坚 固 了 你 的 门 闩 ， 赐 福 给 你 中 间 的 儿 女 。 [kjv] For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee. [bbe] He has made strong the iron bands of your doors; he has sent blessings on your children inside your walls. 147:14 [hgb] 他 使 你 境 内 平 安 。 用 上 好 的 麦 子 使 你 满 足 。 [kjv] He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat. [bbe] He gives peace in all your land, making your stores full of fat grain. 147:15 [hgb] 他 发 命 在 地 。 他 的 话 颁 行 最 快 。 [kjv] He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth very swiftly. [bbe] He sends out his orders to the earth; his word goes out quickly. 147:16 [hgb] 他 降 雪 如 羊 毛 ， 撒 霜 如 炉 灰 。 [kjv] He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes. [bbe] He gives snow like wool; he sends out ice-drops like dust. 147:17 [hgb] 他 掷 下 冰 雹 如 碎 渣 。 他 发 出 寒 冷 ， 谁 能 当 得 起 呢 ？ [kjv] He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold? [bbe] He sends down ice like raindrops: water is made hard by his cold. 147:18 [hgb] 他 一 出 令 ， 这 些 就 都 消 化 。 他 使 风 刮 起 ， 水 便 流 动 。 [kjv] He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow. [bbe] At the outgoing of his word, the ice is turned to water; when he sends out his wind, there is a flowing of waters. 147:19 [hgb] 他 将 他 的 道 指 示 雅 各 ， 将 他 的 律 例 典 章 指 示 以 色 列 。 [kjv] He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel. [bbe] He makes his word clear to Jacob, teaching Israel his laws and his decisions. 147:20 [hgb] 别 国 他 都 没 有 这 样 待 过 。 至 于 他 的 典 章 ， 他 们 向 来 没 有 知 道 。 你 们 要 赞 美 耶 和 华 。 [kjv] He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD. [bbe] He has not done these things for any other nation: and as for his laws, they have no knowledge of them. Let the Lord be praised.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116/1791.html","bookId":182,"book":{"id":182,"title":"诗篇 Psalms","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 不 从 恶 人 的 计 谋 ， 不 站 罪 人 的 道 路 ， 不 坐 亵 慢 人 的 座 位 。 [kjv] Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
