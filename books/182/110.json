I will praise the LORD with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation. [bbe] Let the Lord be praised. I will give praise to the Lord with all my heart, among the upright, and in the meeting of the people. 111:2 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 作 为 本 为 大 。 凡 喜 爱 的 都 必 考 察 。 [kjv] The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein. [bbe] The works of the Lord are great, searched out by all those who have delight in them. 111:3 [hgb] 他 所 行 的 是 尊 荣 和 威 严 。 他 的 公 义 存 到 永 远 。 [kjv] His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever. [bbe] His work is full of honour and glory; and his righteousness is unchanging for ever. 111:4 [hgb] 他 行 了 奇 事 ， 使 人 记 念 。 耶 和 华 有 恩 惠 ， 有 怜 悯 。 [kjv] He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is gracious and full of compassion. [bbe] Certain for ever is the memory of his wonders: the Lord is full of pity and mercy. 111:5 [hgb] 他 赐 粮 食 给 敬 畏 他 的 人 。 他 必 永 远 记 念 他 的 约 。 [kjv] He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant. [bbe] He has given food to his worshippers; he will keep his agreement in mind for ever. 111:6 [hgb] 他 向 百 姓 显 出 大 能 的 作 为 ， 把 外 邦 的 地 赐 给 他 们 为 业 。 [kjv] He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen. [bbe] He has made clear to his people the power of his works, giving them the heritage of the nations. 111:7 [hgb] 他 手 所 行 的 ， 是 诚 实 公 平 。 他 的 训 词 都 是 确 实 的 。 [kjv] The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure. [bbe] The works of his hands are faith and righteousness; all his laws are unchanging. 111:8 [hgb] 是 永 永 远 远 坚 定 的 ， 是 按 诚 实 正 直 设 立 的 。 [kjv] They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness. [bbe] They are fixed for ever and ever, they are done in faith and righteousness. 111:9 [hgb] 他 向 百 姓 施 行 救 赎 ， 命 定 他 的 约 ， 直 到 永 远 。 他 的 名 圣 而 可 畏 。 [kjv] He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name. [bbe] He has sent salvation to his people; he has given his word for ever: holy is his name and greatly to be feared. 111:10 [hgb] 敬 畏 耶 和 华 是 智 慧 得 开 端 。 凡 遵 行 。 他 命 令 的 ， 是 聪 明 人 。 耶 和 华 是 永 远 当 赞 美 的 。 [kjv] The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever. [bbe] The fear of the Lord is the best part of wisdom: all those who keep his laws are wise: his praise is eternal.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116/1755.html","bookId":182,"book":{"id":182,"title":"诗篇 Psalms","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 不 从 恶 人 的 计 谋 ， 不 站 罪 人 的 道 路 ， 不 坐 亵 慢 人 的 座 位 。 [kjv] Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
