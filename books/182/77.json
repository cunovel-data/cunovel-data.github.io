{"id":5626,"no":77,"title":"Chapter 78","content":"78:1 [hgb] （ 亚 萨 的 训 诲 诗 。 ） 我 的 民 哪 ， 你 们 要 留 心 听 我 的 训 诲 ， 侧 耳 听 我 口 中 的 话 。 [kjv] Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth. [bbe] \u003cMaschil. Of Asaph.\u003e Give ear, O my people, to my law; let your ears be bent down to the words of my mouth. 78:2 [hgb] 我 要 开 口 说 比 喻 。 我 要 说 出 古 时 的 谜 语 。 [kjv] I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old: [bbe] Opening my mouth I will give out a story, even the dark sayings of old times; 78:3 [hgb] 是 我 们 所 听 见 所 知 道 的 ， 也 是 我 们 的 祖 宗 告 诉 我 们 的 。 [kjv] Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us. [bbe] Which have come to our hearing and our knowledge, as they were given to us by our fathers. 78:4 [hgb] 我 们 不 将 这 些 事 向 他 们 的 子 孙 隐 瞒 。 要 将 耶 和 华 的 美 德 和 他 的 能 力 ， 并 他 奇 妙 的 作 为 ， 述 说 给 后 代 听 。 [kjv] We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done. [bbe] We will not keep them secret from our children; we will make clear to the coming generation the praises of the Lord and his strength, and the great works of wonder which he has done. 78:5 [hgb] 因 为 他 在 雅 各 中 立 法 度 ， 在 以 色 列 中 设 律 法 ， 是 他 吩 咐 我 们 祖 宗 ， 要 传 给 子 孙 的 。 [kjv] For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children: [bbe] He put up a witness in Jacob, and made a law in Israel; which he gave to our fathers so that they might give knowledge of them to their children; 78:6 [hgb] 使 将 要 生 的 后 代 子 孙 ， 可 以 晓 得 。 他 们 也 要 起 来 告 诉 他 们 的 子 孙 。 [kjv] That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children: [bbe] So that the generation to come might have knowledge of them, even the children of the future, who would give word of them to their children; 78:7 [hgb] 好 叫 他 们 仰 望 神 ， 不 忘 记 神 的 作 为 。 惟 要 守 他 的 命 令 。 [kjv] That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments: [bbe] So that they might put their hope in God, and not let God\u0027s works go out of their minds, but keep his laws; 78:8 [hgb] 不 要 像 他 们 的 祖 宗 ， 是 顽 梗 悖 逆 居 心 不 正 之 辈 ， 向 着 神 心 不 诚 实 。 [kjv] And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God. [bbe] And not be like their fathers, a stiff-necked and uncontrolled generation; a generation whose heart was hard, whose spirit was not true to God. 78:9 [hgb] 以 法 莲 的 子 孙 ， 带 着 兵 器 ， 拿 着 弓 ， 临 阵 之 日 ， 转 身 退 后 。 [kjv] The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle. [bbe] The children of Ephraim, armed with bows, were turned back on the day of the fight. 78:10 [hgb] 他 们 不 遵 守 神 的 约 ， 不 肯 照 他 的 律 法 行 。 [kjv] They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law; [bbe] They were not ruled by God\u0027s word, and they would not go in the way of his law; 78:11 [hgb] 又 忘 记 他 所 行 的 ， 和 他 显 给 他 们 奇 妙 的 作 为 。 [kjv] And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them. [bbe] They let his works go out of their memory, and the wonders which he had made them see. 78:12 [hgb] 他 在 埃 及 地 ， 在 琐 安 田 ， 在 他 们 祖 宗 的 眼 前 ， 施 行 奇 事 。 [kjv] Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. [bbe] He did great works before the eyes of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zoan. 78:13 [hgb] 他 将 海 分 裂 ， 使 他 们 过 去 。 又 叫 水 立 起 如 垒 。 [kjv] He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap. [bbe] The sea was cut in two so that they might go through; the waters were massed together on this side and on that. 78:14 [hgb] 他 白 日 用 云 彩 ， 终 夜 用 火 光 ， 引 导 他 们 。 [kjv] In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire. [bbe] In the daytime he was guiding them in the cloud, and all through the night with a light of fire. 78:15 [hgb] 他 在 旷 野 分 裂 磐 石 ， 多 多 地 给 他 们 水 喝 ， 如 从 深 渊 而 出 。 [kjv] He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths. [bbe] The rocks of the waste land were broken by his power, and he gave them drink as out of the deep waters. 78:16 [hgb] 他 使 水 从 磐 石 涌 出 ， 叫 水 如 江 河 下 流 。 [kjv] He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers. [bbe] He made streams come out of the rock; and waters came flowing down like rivers. 78:17 [hgb] 他 们 却 仍 旧 得 罪 他 ， 在 干 燥 之 地 悖 逆 至 高 者 。 [kjv] And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness. [bbe] And they went on sinning against him even more, turning away from the Most High in the waste land; 78:18 [hgb] 他 们 心 中 试 探 神 ， 随 自 己 所 欲 的 求 食 物 。 [kjv] And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust. [bbe] Testing God in their hearts, requesting meat for their desire. 78:19 [hgb] 并 且 妄 论 神 ， 说 ， 神 在 旷 野 岂 能 摆 设 筵 席 吗 ？ [kjv] Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness? [bbe] They said bitter words against God, saying, Is God able to make ready a table in the waste land? 78:20 [hgb] 他 曾 击 打 磐 石 ， 使 水 涌 出 ， 成 了 江 河 。 他 还 能 赐 粮 食 吗 ？ 还 能 为 他 的 百 姓 预 备 肉 吗 ？ [kjv] Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people? [bbe] See, the rock was cut open by his power, so that the water came rushing out, and overflowing streams; is he able to give us bread? is he able to get meat for his people? 78:21 [hgb] 所 以 耶 和 华 听 见 ， 就 发 怒 。 有 烈 火 向 雅 各 烧 起 ， 有 怒 气 向 以 色 列 上 腾 。 [kjv] Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel; [bbe] So these things came to the Lord\u0027s ears, and he was angry; and a fire was lighted against Jacob, and wrath came up against Israel; 78:22 [hgb] 因 为 他 们 不 信 服 神 ， 不 倚 赖 他 的 救 恩 。 [kjv] Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation: [bbe] Because they had no faith in God, and no hope in his salvation. 78:23 [hgb] 他 却 吩 咐 天 空 ， 又 敞 开 天 上 的 门 。 [kjv] Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven, [bbe] And he gave orders to the clouds on high, and the doors of heaven were open; 78:24 [hgb] 降 吗 哪 像 雨 给 他 们 吃 ， 将 天 上 的 粮 食 赐 给 他 们 。 [kjv] And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven. [bbe] And he sent down manna like rain for their food, and gave them the grain of heaven. 78:25 [hgb] 各 人 （ 或 作 人 ） 吃 大 能 者 的 食 物 。 他 赐 下 粮 食 ， 使 他 们 饱 足 。 [kjv] Man did eat angels\u0027 food: he sent them meat to the full. [bbe] Man took part in the food of strong ones; he sent them meat in full measure. 78:26 [hgb] 他 领 东 风 起 在 天 空 ， 又 用 能 力 引 了 南 风 来 。 [kjv] He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind. [bbe] He sent an east wind from heaven, driving on the south wind by his power. 78:27 [hgb] 他 降 肉 像 雨 在 他 们 当 中 ， 多 如 尘 土 ， 又 降 飞 鸟 ， 多 如 海 沙 。 [kjv] He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea: [bbe] He sent down meat on them like dust, and feathered birds like the sand of the sea, 78:28 [hgb] 落 在 他 们 的 营 中 ， 在 他 们 住 处 的 四 面 。 [kjv] And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations. [bbe] And he let it come down into their resting-place, round about their tents. 78:29 [hgb] 他 们 吃 了 ， 而 且 饱 足 。 这 样 ， 就 随 了 他 们 所 欲 的 。 [kjv] So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire; [bbe] So they had food and were full; for he gave them their desire; 78:30 [hgb] 他 们 贪 而 无 厌 ， 食 物 还 在 他 们 口 中 的 时 候 ， [kjv] They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths, [bbe] But they were not turned from their desires; and while the food was still in their mouths, 78:31 [hgb] 神 的 怒 气 ， 就 向 他 们 上 腾 ， 杀 了 他 们 内 中 的 肥 壮 人 。 打 倒 以 色 列 的 少 年 人 。 [kjv] The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel. [bbe] The wrath of God came on them, and put to death the fattest of them, and put an end to the young men of Israel. 78:32 [hgb] 虽 是 这 样 ， 他 们 仍 旧 犯 罪 ， 不 信 他 奇 妙 的 作 为 。 [kjv] For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works. [bbe] For all this they went on sinning even more, and had no faith in his great wonders. 78:33 [hgb] 因 此 他 叫 他 们 的 日 子 ， 全 归 虚 空 ， 叫 他 们 的 年 岁 ， 尽 属 惊 恐 。 [kjv] Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble. [bbe] So their days were wasted like a breath, and their years in trouble. 78:34 [hgb] 他 杀 他 们 的 时 候 ， 他 们 才 求 问 他 ， 回 心 转 意 ， 切 切 地 寻 求 神 。 [kjv] When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God. [bbe] When he sent death on them, then they made search for him; turning to him and looking for him with care; 78:35 [hgb] 他 们 也 追 念 神 是 他 们 的 磐 石 ， 至 高 的 神 ， 是 他 们 的 救 赎 主 。 [kjv] And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer. [bbe] In the memory that God was their Rock, and the Most High God their saviour. 78:36 [hgb] 他 们 却 用 口 谄 媚 他 ， 用 舌 向 他 说 谎 。 [kjv] Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues. [bbe] But their lips were false to him, and their tongues were untrue to him; 78:37 [hgb] 因 他 们 的 心 向 他 不 正 ， 在 他 的 约 上 ， 也 不 忠 心 。 [kjv] For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant. [bbe] And their hearts were not right with him, and they did not keep their agreement with him. 78:38 [hgb] 但 他 有 怜 悯 ， 赦 免 他 们 的 罪 孽 ， 不 灭 绝 他 们 。 而 且 屡 次 消 他 的 怒 气 ， 不 发 尽 他 的 忿 怒 。 [kjv] But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath. [bbe] But he, being full of pity, has forgiveness for sin, and does not put an end to man: frequently turning back his wrath, and not being violently angry. 78:39 [hgb] 他 想 到 他 们 不 过 是 血 气 ， 是 一 阵 去 而 不 返 的 风 。 [kjv] For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. [bbe] So he kept in mind that they were only flesh; a breath which is quickly gone, and will not come again. 78:40 [hgb] 他 们 在 旷 野 悖 逆 他 ， 在 荒 地 叫 他 担 忧 ， 何 其 多 呢 ？ [kjv] How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert! [bbe] How frequently did they go against him in the waste land, and give him cause for grief in the dry places! 78:41 [hgb] 他 们 再 三 试 探 神 ， 惹 动 以 色 列 的 圣 者 。 [kjv] Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel. [bbe] Again they put God to the test, and gave pain to the Holy One of Israel. 78:42 [hgb] 他 们 不 追 念 他 的 能 力 （ 原 文 作 手 ） ， 和 赎 他 们 脱 离 敌 人 的 日 子 。 [kjv] They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy. [bbe] They did not keep in mind the work of his hand, or the day when he took them from the power of their haters; 78:43 [hgb] 他 怎 样 在 埃 及 地 显 神 迹 ， 在 琐 安 田 显 奇 事 。 [kjv] How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan: [bbe] How he had done his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan; 78:44 [hgb] 把 他 们 的 江 河 ， 并 河 汊 的 水 ， 都 变 为 血 ， 使 他 们 不 能 喝 。 [kjv] And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink. [bbe] So that their rivers were turned to blood, and they were not able to get drink from their streams. 78:45 [hgb] 他 叫 苍 蝇 成 群 ， 落 在 他 们 当 中 ， 嘬 尽 他 们 。 又 叫 青 蛙 灭 了 他 们 。 [kjv] He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. [bbe] He sent different sorts of flies among them, poisoning their flesh; and frogs for their destruction. 78:46 [hgb] 把 他 们 的 土 产 交 给 蚂 蚱 ， 把 他 们 辛 苦 得 来 的 交 给 蝗 虫 。 [kjv] He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust. [bbe] He gave the increase of their fields to worms, the fruits of their industry to the locusts. 78:47 [hgb] 他 降 冰 雹 打 坏 他 们 的 葡 萄 树 。 下 严 霜 打 坏 他 们 的 桑 树 。 [kjv] He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost. [bbe] He sent ice for the destruction of their vines; their trees were damaged by the bitter cold. 78:48 [hgb] 又 把 他 们 的 牲 畜 交 给 冰 雹 ， 把 他 们 的 群 畜 交 给 闪 电 。 [kjv] He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. [bbe] Ice was rained down on their cattle; thunderstorms sent destruction among the flocks. 78:49 [hgb] 他 使 猛 烈 的 怒 气 ， 和 忿 怒 ， 恼 恨 ， 苦 难 ， 成 了 一 群 降 灾 的 使 者 ， 临 到 他 们 。 [kjv] He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them. [bbe] He sent on them the heat of his wrath, his bitter disgust, letting loose evil angels among them. 78:50 [hgb] 他 为 自 己 的 怒 气 修 平 了 路 ， 将 他 们 交 给 瘟 疫 ， 使 他 们 死 亡 。 [kjv] He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence; [bbe] He let his wrath have its way; he did not keep back their soul from death, but gave their life to disease. 78:51 [hgb] 在 埃 及 击 杀 一 切 长 子 ， 在 含 的 帐 棚 中 ， 击 杀 他 们 强 壮 时 头 生 的 。 [kjv] And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham: [bbe] He gave to destruction all the first sons of Egypt; the first-fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham; 78:52 [hgb] 他 却 领 出 自 己 的 民 如 羊 ， 在 旷 野 引 他 们 如 羊 群 。 [kjv] But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. [bbe] But he took his people out like sheep, guiding them in the waste land like a flock. 78:53 [hgb] 他 领 他 们 稳 稳 妥 妥 的 ， 使 他 们 不 至 害 怕 。 海 却 淹 没 他 们 的 仇 敌 。 [kjv] And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. [bbe] He took them on safely so that they had no fear; but their haters were covered by the sea. 78:54 [hgb] 他 带 他 们 到 自 己 圣 地 的 边 界 ， 到 他 右 手 所 得 的 这 山 地 。 [kjv] And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased. [bbe] And he was their guide to his holy land, even to the mountain, which his right hand had made his; 78:55 [hgb] 他 在 他 们 面 前 赶 出 外 邦 人 ， 用 绳 子 将 外 邦 的 地 量 给 他 们 为 业 ， 叫 以 色 列 支 派 的 人 ， 住 在 他 们 的 帐 棚 里 。 [kjv] He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. [bbe] Driving out nations before them, marking out the line of their heritage, and giving the people of Israel their tents for a resting-place. 78:56 [hgb] 他 们 仍 旧 试 探 悖 逆 至 高 的 神 ， 不 守 他 的 法 度 。 [kjv] Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies: [bbe] But they were bitter against the Most High God, testing him, and not keeping his laws; 78:57 [hgb] 反 倒 退 后 ， 行 诡 诈 ， 像 他 们 的 祖 宗 一 样 。 他 们 改 变 ， 如 同 翻 背 的 弓 。 [kjv] But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow. [bbe] Their hearts were turned back and untrue like their fathers; they were turned to one side like a twisted bow. 78:58 [hgb] 因 他 们 的 丘 坛 ， 惹 了 他 的 怒 气 ， 因 他 们 雕 刻 的 偶 像 ， 触 动 他 的 愤 恨 。 [kjv] For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. [bbe] They made him angry with their high places; moving him to wrath with their images. 78:59 [hgb] 神 听 见 ， 就 发 怒 ， 极 其 憎 恶 以 色 列 人 。 [kjv] When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel: [bbe] When this came to God\u0027s ears he was very angry, and gave up Israel completely; 78:60 [hgb] 甚 至 他 离 弃 示 罗 的 帐 幕 ， 就 是 他 在 人 间 所 搭 的 帐 棚 。 [kjv] So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men; [bbe] So that he went away from the holy place in Shiloh, the tent which he had put among men; 78:61 [hgb] 又 将 他 的 约 柜 （ 原 文 作 能 力 ） 交 与 人 掳 去 ， 将 他 的 荣 耀 交 在 敌 人 手 中 。 [kjv] And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy\u0027s hand. [bbe] And he let his strength be taken prisoner, and gave his glory into the hands of his hater. 78:62 [hgb] 并 将 他 的 百 姓 交 与 刀 剑 ， 向 他 的 产 业 发 怒 。 [kjv] He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance. [bbe] He gave his people up to the sword, and was angry with his heritage. 78:63 [hgb] 少 年 人 被 火 烧 灭 。 处 女 也 无 喜 歌 。 [kjv] The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage. [bbe] Their young men were burned in the fire; and their virgins were not praised in the bride-song. 78:64 [hgb] 祭 司 倒 在 刀 下 。 寡 妇 却 不 哀 哭 。 [kjv] Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation. [bbe] Their priests were put to death by the sword, and their widows made no weeping for them. 78:65 [hgb] 那 时 主 像 世 人 睡 醒 ， 像 勇 士 饮 酒 呼 喊 。 [kjv] Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. [bbe] Then was the Lord like one awaking from sleep, and like a strong man crying out because of wine. 78:66 [hgb] 他 就 打 退 了 他 的 敌 人 ， 叫 他 们 永 蒙 羞 辱 。 [kjv] And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach. [bbe] His haters were turned back by his blows and shamed for ever. 78:67 [hgb] 并 且 他 弃 掉 约 瑟 的 帐 棚 ， 不 拣 选 以 法 莲 支 派 ， [kjv] Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: [bbe] And he put the tent of Joseph on one side, and took not the tribe of Ephraim; 78:68 [hgb] 却 拣 选 犹 大 支 派 ， 他 所 喜 爱 的 锡 安 山 。 [kjv] But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved. [bbe] But he took the tribe of Judah for himself, and the mountain of Zion, in which he had pleasure. 78:69 [hgb] 盖 造 他 的 圣 所 ， 好 像 高 峰 ， 又 像 他 建 立 永 存 之 地 。 [kjv] And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever. [bbe] And he made his holy place like the high heaven, like the earth which is fixed by him for ever. 78:70 [hgb] 又 拣 选 他 的 仆 人 大 卫 ， 从 羊 圈 中 将 他 召 来 。 [kjv] He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds: [bbe] He took David to be his servant, taking him from the place of the flocks; 78:71 [hgb] 叫 他 不 再 跟 从 那 些 带 奶 的 母 羊 ， 为 要 牧 养 自 己 的 百 姓 雅 各 ， 和 自 己 的 产 业 以 色 列 。 [kjv] From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. [bbe] From looking after the sheep which were giving milk, he took him to give food to Jacob his people, and to Israel his heritage. 78:72 [hgb] 于 是 他 按 心 中 的 纯 正 ， 牧 养 他 们 ， 用 手 中 的 巧 妙 ， 引 导 他 们 。 [kjv] So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands. [bbe] So he gave them food with an upright heart, guiding them by the wisdom of his hands.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116/1722.html","bookId":182,"book":{"id":182,"title":"诗篇 Psalms","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 不 从 恶 人 的 计 谋 ， 不 站 罪 人 的 道 路 ， 不 坐 亵 慢 人 的 座 位 。 [kjv] Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
