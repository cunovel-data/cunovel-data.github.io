{"id":5559,"no":10,"title":"Chapter 10","content":"10:1 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 你 为 什 么 站 在 远 处 。 在 患 难 的 时 候 ， 为 什 么 隐 藏 。 [kjv] Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble? [bbe] Why do you keep far away, O Lord? why are you not to be seen in times of trouble? 10:2 [hgb] 恶 人 在 骄 横 中 ， 把 困 苦 人 追 得 火 急 。 愿 他 们 陷 在 自 己 所 设 的 计 谋 里 。 [kjv] The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined. [bbe] The evil-doer in his pride is cruel to the poor; let him be taken by the tricks of his invention. 10:3 [hgb] 因 为 恶 人 以 心 愿 自 夸 。 贪 财 的 背 弃 耶 和 华 ， 并 且 轻 慢 他 （ 或 作 他 祝 福 贪 财 的 ， 却 轻 慢 耶 和 华 ） 。 [kjv] For the wicked boasteth of his heart\u0027s desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth. [bbe] For the evil-doer is lifted up because of the purpose of his heart, and he whose mind is fixed on wealth is turned away from the Lord, saying evil against him. 10:4 [hgb] 恶 人 面 带 骄 傲 ， 说 ， 耶 和 华 必 不 追 究 。 他 一 切 所 想 的 ， 都 以 为 没 有 神 。 [kjv] The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts. [bbe] The evil-doer in his pride says, God will not make a search. All his thoughts are, There is no God. 10:5 [hgb] 凡 他 所 作 的 ， 时 常 稳 固 。 你 的 审 判 超 过 他 的 眼 界 。 至 于 他 一 切 的 敌 人 ， 他 都 向 他 们 喷 气 。 [kjv] His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them. [bbe] His ways are ever fixed; your decisions are higher than he may see: as for his haters, they are as nothing to him. 10:6 [hgb] 他 心 里 说 ， 我 必 不 动 摇 ， 世 世 代 代 不 遭 灾 难 。 [kjv] He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity. [bbe] He has said in his heart, I will not be moved: through all generations I will never be in trouble. 10:7 [hgb] 他 满 口 是 咒 骂 ， 诡 诈 ， 欺 压 。 舌 底 是 毒 害 奸 恶 。 [kjv] His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity. [bbe] His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and false words: under his tongue are evil purposes and dark thoughts. 10:8 [hgb] 他 在 村 庄 埋 伏 等 候 。 他 在 隐 密 处 杀 害 无 辜 的 人 。 他 的 眼 睛 窥 探 无 倚 无 靠 的 人 。 [kjv] He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor. [bbe] He is waiting in the dark places of the towns: in the secret places he puts to death those who have done no wrong: his eyes are secretly turned against the poor. 10:9 [hgb] 他 埋 伏 在 暗 地 ， 如 狮 子 蹲 在 洞 中 。 他 埋 伏 ， 要 掳 去 困 苦 人 。 他 拉 网 ， 就 把 困 苦 人 掳 去 。 [kjv] He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net. [bbe] He keeps himself in a secret place like a lion in his hole, waiting to put his hands on the poor man, and pulling him into his net. 10:10 [hgb] 他 屈 身 蹲 伏 ， 无 倚 无 靠 的 人 ， 就 倒 在 他 爪 牙 之 下 （ 爪 牙 或 作 强 暴 人 ） ， [kjv] He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones. [bbe] The upright are crushed and made low, and the feeble are overcome by his strong ones. 10:11 [hgb] 他 心 里 说 ， 神 竟 忘 记 了 。 他 掩 面 ， 永 不 观 看 。 [kjv] He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it. [bbe] He says in his heart, God has no memory of me: his face is turned away; he will never see it. 10:12 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 求 你 起 来 。 神 阿 ， 求 你 举 手 。 不 要 忘 记 困 苦 人 。 [kjv] Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble. [bbe] Up! O Lord; let your hand be lifted: give thought to the poor. 10:13 [hgb] 恶 人 为 何 轻 慢 神 ， 心 里 说 ， 你 必 不 追 究 。 [kjv] Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it. [bbe] Why has the evil-doer a low opinion of God, saying in his heart, You will not make search for it? 10:14 [hgb] 其 实 你 已 经 观 看 。 因 为 奸 恶 毒 害 ， 你 都 看 见 了 ， 为 要 以 手 施 行 报 应 。 无 倚 无 靠 的 人 ， 把 自 己 交 托 你 。 你 向 来 是 帮 助 孤 儿 的 。 [kjv] Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless. [bbe] You have seen it; for your eyes are on sorrow and grief, to take it into your hand: the poor man puts his faith in you; you have been the helper of the child who has no father. 10:15 [hgb] 愿 你 打 断 恶 人 的 膀 臂 。 至 于 坏 人 ， 愿 你 追 究 他 的 恶 ， 直 到 净 尽 。 [kjv] Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none. [bbe] Let the arm of the sinner and the evil-doer be broken; go on searching for his sin till there is no more. 10:16 [hgb] 耶 和 华 永 永 远 远 为 王 。 外 邦 人 从 他 的 地 已 经 灭 绝 了 。 [kjv] The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land. [bbe] The Lord is King for ever and ever; the nations are gone from his land. 10:17 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 谦 卑 人 的 心 愿 ， 你 早 已 知 道 （ 原 文 作 听 见 ） 。 你 必 预 备 他 们 的 心 ， 也 必 侧 耳 听 他 们 的 祈 求 。 [kjv] LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear: [bbe] Lord, you have given ear to the prayer of the poor: you will make strong their hearts, you will give them a hearing: 10:18 [hgb] 为 要 给 孤 儿 和 受 欺 压 的 人 伸 冤 ， 使 强 横 的 人 不 再 威 吓 他 们 。 [kjv] To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress. [bbe] To give decision for the child without a father and for the broken-hearted, so that the man of the earth may no longer be feared.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116/1655.html","bookId":182,"book":{"id":182,"title":"诗篇 Psalms","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 不 从 恶 人 的 计 谋 ， 不 站 罪 人 的 道 路 ， 不 坐 亵 慢 人 的 座 位 。 [kjv] Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
