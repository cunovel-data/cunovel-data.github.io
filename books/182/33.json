{"id":5582,"no":33,"title":"Chapter 33","content":"33:1 [hgb] 义 人 哪 ， 你 们 应 当 靠 耶 和 华 欢 乐 。 正 直 人 的 赞 美 是 合 宜 的 。 \n [kjv] Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for the upright. \n [bbe] Be glad in the Lord, O doers of righteousness; for praise is beautiful for the upright. \n 33:2 [hgb] 你 们 应 当 弹 琴 称 谢 耶 和 华 ， 用 十 弦 瑟 歌 颂 他 。 \n [kjv] Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings. \n [bbe] Give praise to the Lord on the corded instrument; make melody to him with instruments of music. \n 33:3 [hgb] 应 当 向 他 唱 新 歌 ， 弹 得 巧 妙 ， 声 音 洪 亮 。 \n [kjv] Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise. \n [bbe] Make a new song to him; playing expertly with a loud noise. \n 33:4 [hgb] 因 为 耶 和 华 的 言 语 正 直 。 凡 他 所 作 的 ， 尽 都 诚 实 。 \n [kjv] For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in truth. \n [bbe] For the word of the Lord is upright, and all his works are certain. \n 33:5 [hgb] 他 喜 爱 仁 义 公 平 。 遍 地 满 了 耶 和 华 的 慈 爱 。 \n [kjv] He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD. \n [bbe] His delight is in righteousness and wisdom; the earth is full of the mercy of the Lord. \n 33:6 [hgb] 诸 天 借 耶 和 华 的 命 而 造 ， 万 象 借 他 口 中 的 气 而 成 。 \n [kjv] By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. \n [bbe] By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the army of heaven by the breath of his mouth. \n 33:7 [hgb] 他 聚 集 海 水 如 垒 ， 收 藏 深 洋 在 库 房 。 \n [kjv] He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses. \n [bbe] He makes the waters of the sea come together in a mass; he keeps the deep seas in store-houses. \n 33:8 [hgb] 愿 全 地 都 敬 畏 耶 和 华 。 愿 世 上 的 居 民 ， 都 惧 怕 他 。 \n [kjv] Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. \n [bbe] Let the earth be full of the fear of the Lord; let all the people of the world be in holy fear of him. \n 33:9 [hgb] 因 为 他 说 有 ， 就 有 。 命 立 ， 就 立 。 \n [kjv] For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast. \n [bbe] For he gave the word, and it was done; by his order it was fixed for ever. \n 33:10 [hgb] 耶 和 华 使 列 国 的 筹 算 归 于 无 有 ， 使 众 民 的 思 念 无 有 功 效 。 \n [kjv] The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect. \n [bbe] The Lord undoes the designs of the nations; he makes the thoughts of the peoples without effect. \n 33:11 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 寿 算 永 远 立 定 ， 他 心 中 的 思 念 万 代 常 存 。 \n [kjv] The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations. \n [bbe] The Lord\u0027s purpose is eternal, the designs of his heart go on through all the generations of man. \n 33:12 [hgb] 以 耶 和 华 为 神 的 ， 那 国 是 有 福 的 。 他 所 拣 选 为 自 己 产 业 的 ， 那 民 是 有 福 的 。 \n [kjv] Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance. \n [bbe] Happy is the nation whose God is the Lord; and the people whom he has taken for his heritage. \n 33:13 [hgb] 耶 和 华 从 天 上 观 看 。 他 看 见 一 切 的 世 人 。 \n [kjv] The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men. \n [bbe] The Lord is looking down from heaven; he sees all the sons of men; \n 33:14 [hgb] 从 他 的 居 所 ， 往 外 察 看 地 上 一 切 的 居 民 。 \n [kjv] From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth. \n [bbe] From his house he keeps watch on all who are living on the earth; \n 33:15 [hgb] 他 是 那 造 成 他 们 众 人 心 的 ， 留 意 他 们 一 切 作 为 的 。 \n [kjv] He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works. \n [bbe] He makes all their hearts; their works are clear to him. \n 33:16 [hgb] 君 王 不 能 因 兵 多 得 胜 。 勇 士 不 能 因 力 大 得 救 。 \n [kjv] There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength. \n [bbe] A king\u0027s salvation is not in the power of his army; a strong man does not get free by his great strength. \n 33:17 [hgb] 靠 马 得 救 是 枉 然 的 。 马 也 不 能 因 力 大 救 人 。 \n [kjv] An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver any by his great strength. \n [bbe] A horse is a false hope; his great power will not make any man free from danger. \n 33:18 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 眼 目 ， 看 顾 敬 畏 他 的 人 ， 和 仰 望 他 慈 爱 的 人 ， \n [kjv] Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy; \n [bbe] See, the eye of the Lord is on those in whose hearts is the fear of him, on those whose hope is in his mercy; \n 33:19 [hgb] 要 救 他 们 的 命 脱 离 死 亡 ， 并 使 他 们 在 饥 荒 中 存 活 。 \n [kjv] To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine. \n [bbe] To keep their souls from death; and to keep them living in time of need. \n 33:20 [hgb] 我 们 的 心 向 来 等 候 耶 和 华 。 他 是 我 们 的 帮 助 ， 我 们 的 盾 牌 。 \n [kjv] Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield. \n [bbe] Our souls are waiting for the Lord; he is our help and our salvation. \n 33:21 [hgb] 我 们 的 心 必 靠 他 欢 喜 ， 因 为 我 们 向 来 倚 靠 他 的 圣 名 。 \n [kjv] For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name. \n [bbe] For in him our hearts have joy; in his holy name is our hope. \n 33:22 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 求 你 照 着 我 们 所 仰 望 你 的 ， 向 我 们 施 行 慈 爱 。 \n [kjv] Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee. \n [bbe] Let your mercy be on us, O Lord, as we are waiting for you. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116/1678.html","bookId":182,"book":{"id":182,"title":"诗篇 Psalms","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 不 从 恶 人 的 计 谋 ， 不 站 罪 人 的 道 路 ， 不 坐 亵 慢 人 的 座 位 。 [kjv] Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
