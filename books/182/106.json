\n [bbe] Let men give praise to the Lord for his mercy, and for the wonders which he does for the children of men! \n 107:9 [hgb] 因 他 使 心 里 渴 慕 的 人 ， 得 以 知 足 ， 使 心 里 饥 饿 的 人 ， 得 饱 美 物 。 \n [kjv] For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness. \n [bbe] He gives its desire to the unresting soul, so that it is full of good things. \n 107:10 [hgb] 那 些 坐 在 黑 暗 中 死 荫 里 的 人 ， 被 困 苦 和 铁 链 捆 锁 ， \n [kjv] Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron; \n [bbe] Those who were in the dark, in the black night, in chains of sorrow and iron; \n 107:11 [hgb] 是 因 他 们 违 背 神 的 话 语 ， 藐 视 至 高 者 的 旨 意 。 \n [kjv] Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High: \n [bbe] Because they went against the words of God, and gave no thought to the laws of the Most High: \n 107:12 [hgb] 所 以 ， 他 用 劳 苦 治 服 他 们 的 心 。 他 们 仆 倒 ， 无 人 扶 助 。 \n [kjv] Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help. \n [bbe] So that he made their hearts weighted down with grief; they were falling, and had no helper. \n 107:13 [hgb] 于 是 ， 他 们 在 苦 难 中 哀 求 耶 和 华 ， 他 从 他 们 的 祸 患 中 拯 救 他 们 。 \n [kjv] Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses. \n [bbe] Then they sent up their cry to the Lord in their sorrow, and he gave them salvation out of all their troubles. \n 107:14 [hgb] 他 从 黑 暗 中 ， 和 死 荫 里 ， 领 他 们 出 来 ， 折 断 他 们 的 绑 索 。 \n [kjv] He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder. \n [bbe] He took them out of the dark and the black night, and all their chains were broken. \n 107:15 [hgb] 但 愿 人 因 耶 和 华 的 慈 爱 ， 和 他 向 人 所 行 的 奇 事 都 称 赞 他 。 \n [kjv] Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! \n [bbe] Let men give praise to the Lord for his mercy, and for the wonders which he does for the children of men! \n 107:16 [hgb] 因 为 他 打 破 了 铜 门 ， 砍 断 了 铁 闩 。 \n [kjv] For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder. \n [bbe] The doors of brass are broken by his arm, and the bands of iron are cut in two. \n 107:17 [hgb] 愚 妄 人 因 自 己 的 过 犯 ， 和 自 己 的 罪 孽 便 受 苦 楚 。 \n [kjv] Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted. \n [bbe] Foolish men, because of their sins, and because of their wrongdoing, are troubled; \n 107:18 [hgb] 他 们 心 里 厌 恶 各 样 的 食 物 ， 就 临 近 死 门 。 \n [kjv] Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death. \n [bbe] They are disgusted by all food, and they come near to the doors of death. \n 107:19 [hgb] 于 是 ， 他 们 在 苦 难 中 哀 求 耶 和 华 ， 他 从 他 们 的 祸 患 中 拯 救 他 们 。 \n [kjv] Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses. \n [bbe] Then they send up their cry to the Lord in their sorrow, and he gives them salvation out of all their troubles. \n 107:20 [hgb] 他 发 命 医 治 他 们 ， 救 他 们 脱 离 死 亡 。 \n [kjv] He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions. \n [bbe] He sent his word and made them well, and kept them safe from the underworld. \n 107:21 [hgb] 但 愿 人 因 耶 和 华 的 慈 爱 ， 和 他 向 人 所 行 的 奇 事 都 称 赞 他 。 \n [kjv] Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! \n [bbe] Let men give praise to the Lord for his mercy, and for the wonders which he does for the children of men! \n 107:22 [hgb] 愿 他 们 以 感 谢 为 祭 献 给 他 ， 欢 呼 述 说 他 的 作 为 。 \n [kjv] And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing. \n [bbe] Let them make offerings of praise, giving news of his works with cries of joy. \n 107:23 [hgb] 在 海 上 坐 船 ， 在 大 水 中 经 理 事 务 的 。 \n [kjv] They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; \n [bbe] Those who go down to the sea in ships, who do business in the great waters; \n 107:24 [hgb] 他 们 看 见 耶 和 华 的 作 为 ， 并 他 在 深 水 中 的 奇 事 。 \n [kjv] These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep. \n [bbe] They see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep. \n 107:25 [hgb] 因 他 一 吩 咐 ， 狂 风 就 起 来 ， 海 中 的 波 浪 也 扬 起 。 \n [kjv] For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. \n [bbe] For at his word comes up the storm-wind, lifting high the waves. \n 107:26 [hgb] 他 们 上 到 天 空 ， 下 到 海 底 ， 他 们 的 心 因 患 难 便 消 化 。 \n [kjv] They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble. \n [bbe] The sailors go up to heaven, and down into the deep; their souls are wasted because of their trouble. \n 107:27 [hgb] 他 们 摇 摇 幌 幌 。 东 倒 西 歪 ， 好 像 醉 酒 的 人 。 他 们 的 智 慧 无 法 可 施 。 \n [kjv] They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit\u0027s end. \n [bbe] They are turned here and there, rolling like a man who is full of wine; and all their wisdom comes to nothing. \n 107:28 [hgb] 于 是 ， 他 们 在 苦 难 中 哀 求 耶 和 华 ， 他 从 他 们 的 祸 患 中 领 出 他 们 来 。 \n [kjv] Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. \n [bbe] Then they send up their cry to the Lord in their sorrow, and he gives them salvation out of all their troubles. \n 107:29 [hgb] 他 使 狂 风 止 息 ， 波 浪 就 平 静 。 \n [kjv] He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. \n [bbe] He makes the storm into a calm, so that the waves are at peace. \n 107:30 [hgb] 风 息 浪 静 ， 他 们 便 欢 喜 。 他 就 引 他 们 到 所 愿 去 的 海 口 。 \n [kjv] Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven. \n [bbe] Then they are glad, because the sea is quiet, and he takes them to the harbour of their desire. \n 107:31 [hgb] 但 愿 人 因 耶 和 华 的 慈 爱 ， 和 他 向 人 所 行 的 奇 事 都 称 赞 他 。 \n [kjv] Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! \n [bbe] Let men give praise to the Lord for his mercy, and for the wonders which he does for the children of men! \n 107:32 [hgb] 愿 他 们 在 民 的 会 中 尊 崇 他 ， 在 长 老 的 位 上 赞 美 他 。 \n [kjv] Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders. \n [bbe] Let them give glory to him in the meeting of the people, and praise among the chiefs. \n 107:33 [hgb] 他 使 江 河 变 为 旷 野 ， 叫 水 泉 变 为 干 渴 之 地 。 \n [kjv] He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground; \n [bbe] He makes rivers into waste places, and springs of water into a dry land; \n 107:34 [hgb] 使 肥 地 变 为 碱 地 。 这 都 因 其 间 居 民 的 罪 恶 。 \n [kjv] A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein. \n [bbe] He makes a fertile country into a salt waste, because of the sins of those who are living there. \n 107:35 [hgb] 他 使 旷 野 变 为 水 潭 ， 叫 旱 地 变 为 水 泉 。 \n [kjv] He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings. \n [bbe] He makes a waste land into a place of water, and a dry land into water-springs. \n 107:36 [hgb] 他 使 饥 饿 的 人 住 在 那 里 ， 好 建 造 可 住 的 城 邑 。 \n [kjv] And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation; \n [bbe] And there he gives the poor a resting-place, so that they may make themselves a town; \n 107:37 [hgb] 又 种 田 地 ， 栽 葡 萄 园 ， 得 享 所 出 的 土 产 。 \n [kjv] And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase. \n [bbe] And put seed in the fields and make vine-gardens, to give them fruit. \n 107:38 [hgb] 他 又 赐 福 给 他 们 ， 叫 他 们 生 养 众 多 。 也 不 叫 他 们 的 牲 畜 减 少 。 \n [kjv] He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease. \n [bbe] He gives them his blessing so that they are increased greatly, and their cattle do not become less. \n 107:39 [hgb] 他 们 又 因 暴 虐 ， 患 难 ， 愁 苦 ， 就 减 少 且 卑 下 。 \n [kjv] Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow. \n [bbe] And when they are made low, and crushed by trouble and sorrow, \n 107:40 [hgb] 他 使 君 王 蒙 羞 被 辱 ， 使 他 们 在 荒 废 无 路 之 地 漂 流 。 \n [kjv] He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way. \n [bbe] He puts an end to the pride of kings, and sends them wandering in the waste lands where there is no way. \n 107:41 [hgb] 他 却 将 穷 乏 人 安 置 在 高 处 ， 脱 离 苦 难 ， 使 他 的 家 属 多 如 羊 群 。 \n [kjv] Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock. \n [bbe] But he puts the poor man on high from his troubles, and gives him families like a flock. \n 107:42 [hgb] 正 直 人 看 见 ， 就 欢 喜 。 罪 孽 之 辈 ， 必 塞 口 无 言 。 \n [kjv] The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth. \n [bbe] The upright see it and are glad: the mouth of the sinner is stopped. \n 107:43 [hgb] 凡 有 智 慧 的 ， 必 在 这 些 事 上 留 心 ， 也 必 思 想 耶 和 华 的 慈 爱 。 \n [kjv] Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD. \n [bbe] Let the wise give thought to these things, and see the mercies of the Lord. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116/1751.html","bookId":182,"book":{"id":182,"title":"诗篇 Psalms","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 不 从 恶 人 的 计 谋 ， 不 站 罪 人 的 道 路 ， 不 坐 亵 慢 人 的 座 位 。 [kjv] Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/116","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
