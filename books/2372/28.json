{"id":69936,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"LEXI SAT ALONE IN THE DOCTOR\u0027S WAITING ROOM, GLANCING impatiently at her BlackBerry. How much longer were they going to keep her waiting? Didn\u0027t they realize she had a business to run? It was late October, ten days after Max Webster\u0027s shocking suicide, and New York had suddenly plunged headlong into winter. In other years, Lexi\u0027s spirits always lifted with the first frost. She loved the cold bite of the air on the city streets, the smell of the chestnut vendors outside her building, the blinding glare of winter sunlight in the crisp ice-blue sky. It roused some childish excitement in her: the promise of Christmas, Santa Claus, brightly wrapped boxes and ribbons, wood smoke, cinnamon. This year, however, the New York cold seemed to have seeped into her bones. She felt drained. Listless. Max\u0027s death had neither elated nor shattered her. She was numbed with a cold that froze from the inside out, from her heart to the tips of her Gucci-gloved fingers. \"Ms. Templeton?\" The receptionist was a plump black woman dressed from head to toe in orange. Even her cheap plastic earrings were Halloween-hued. She tapped Lexi on the shoulder. \"We\u0027ve been calling you, ma\u0027am. Dr. Neale will see you now.\" Dr. Perregrine Neale had known Lexi Templeton since she was a child. A keen tennis player in his midsixties, he prided himself on his still-trim figure. With his distinguished gray hair, deep voice and strong, masculine features, Perry Neale was particularly popular with middle-aged women patients; a category to which Lexi now technically belonged, although looking at her clear skin and blond hair without so much as a hint of gray, it was hard to believe she was forty years old. \"Come in, Lexi. Have a seat.\" \"I won\u0027t, if you don\u0027t mind, Perry. I\u0027m in kind of a rush. If you could just let me have my test results and a prescription, I\u0027ll be out of your hair.\" Perregrine Neale gestured to the Ralph Lauren armchair in the corner. \"Please. This won\u0027t take long. You look tired.\" Lexi sat down. \"I am tired. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here. I\u0027m sick and tired of being tired.\" Perregrine Neale laughed. \"That\u0027s to be expected. The first trimester is often the most exhausting.\" \"I\u0027m sorry?\" \"I said it\u0027s normal to feel excessively tired in the early stages of a pregnancy. You\u0027re pregnant, Lexi.\" Now it was Lexi\u0027s turn to laugh. \"I don\u0027t think so, Perry. You must have mixed my blood sample with someone else\u0027s. Not to put too fine a point on it, I haven\u0027t had sex in months. Not to mention the fact that I\u0027m forty years old and I\u0027ve been on the pill since dinosaurs roamed the earth!\" \"Be that as it may, you\u0027re pregnant. I would estimate you\u0027re about three months gone. We\u0027ll have to do a scan to be sure.\" Perregrine Neale\u0027s face was deadly serious. Lexi was suddenly glad she was sitting down. Cold beads of sweat began to roll down her spine. She gripped the sides of the chair, fighting back a rising tide of nausea. \"I can\u0027t be pregnant.\" Painfully, she cast her mind back to the last time she and Gabe had slept together. It was two weeks before she made her move on Kruger-Brent. How long ago was that? She\u0027d come home late, wound up like a clockwork toy after a tense, secret meeting with Carl Kolepp. When Gabe tried to touch her, Lexi pushed him away. But for once, he\u0027d forced the issue, stroking and exciting her as only he could, bringing her to orgasm twice before finally pushing himself inside her, obliterating the tension from her mind and body. Perregrine Neale was still talking. \"...twelve weeks...nuchal scan...baby\u0027s neck measurements...\" His voice washed over Lexi like an echo, distant and unreal. \"...older first-time mothers...elevated risk...\" \"No.\" Lexi spoke so softly that at first the doctor didn\u0027t hear her. \"What did you say?\" \"I said NO!\" This time the panic in her voice was unmistakable. \"I can\u0027t be pregnant.\" \"Lexi. You are pregnant.\" \"I mean I can\u0027t...I can\u0027t have a baby. I can\u0027t go through with it.\" Perregrine Neale paused. \"You want to terminate?\" Lexi nodded. \"I can arrange that, of course. But don\u0027t make any rushed decisions. Clearly, the pregnancy was unexpected. Perhaps if you gave yourself a chance to get used to the idea - \" \"No.\" Lexi shook her head fervently. Her mind was filled with images of Gabe, his face, his body. Forcibly, she pushed them out, screwing her eyes closed. \"I can\u0027t do it, Perry. There\u0027s work. Kruger-Brent. We\u0027re only just starting to rebuild. The timing couldn\u0027t be worse.\" \"Lexi, please don\u0027t take this the wrong way. But you\u0027re forty years old. You may not get another chance at pregnancy, at least not naturally. There\u0027s always IVF, of course, but statistically the odds are not great.\" \"I don\u0027t want another chance.\" Lexi stood up. She was shaking, but her voice was firm. \"I don\u0027t want children, Perry. Please set up a termination as soon as possible.\" She walked out of the office, slamming the door behind her. Gabe McGregor sat on the veranda of his new Cape Town apartment, lost in thought. Maybe he should have waited? Shopped around a bit before signing the lease? It was the first place the real-estate agent had shown him that met his requirements: private, not too big, excellent security, ocean views. Gabe had signed on the dotted line within a minute of walking through the door. But now he thought: What am I doing here? This isn\u0027t home. What had he expected? He\u0027d moved back to South Africa because, after Lexi, he had to leave New York. And because he had nowhere else to go. Scotland wasn\u0027t home anymore. London was cold and gray, not a city to move to when trying to escape depression. South Africa had been his home once. Maybe it could be again? Or maybe not. Cape Town was so charged with memories of Tara and the children, of Dia and Phoenix, of happiness found and lost, that when Gabe walked the streets, even the air smelled of grief. He\u0027d hoped his new bachelor apartment might jolt him out of his sadness. Something modern and fresh, with no womanly touches, nothing to remind him of Lexi or his marriage. But it was no good. A fresh start wasn\u0027t about geography or chrome kitchen fixtures or black marble bathrooms. It was about moving in his heart. Sipping his Beck\u0027s beer, gazing at the bleeding blood-orange sunset, it came to him with searing clarity. I don\u0027t want to move on in my heart. I want Lexi back. He\u0027d thought about contacting her after she sent the check. He\u0027d even picked up the phone a couple times and gotten halfway through her number before hanging up, cursing himself for being a fool. It wasn\u0027t the money that broke us up. It was the distance, the secrets, the lies. I never really \"had\" Lexi. Kruger-Brent did, and it still does. Gabe followed the news about Kruger-Brent\u0027s revival with a sort of agonized compulsion. Every article, every TV news story, was a connection to Lexi that both thrilled and tortured him. In interviews, she looked poised and confident, a brilliant businesswoman on her way back to the top. There was no trace of pain, let alone heartbreak, beneath the flawless studio makeup. When Max\u0027s suicide hit the news, Gabe expected - hoped? - to see some cracks in Lexi\u0027s invulnerable facade. But even her response to that had been cool and on message. \"My heart goes out to his wife and family, of course. But at Kruger-Brent it\u0027s business as usual.\" No one watching her would have guessed that she had once loved Max with all her heart. That they\u0027d grown up together, as Lexi herself used to say, like two sides of the same person. It was getting cool. Gabe finished his beer and walked inside his pristine, state-of-the-art apartment. He\u0027d never felt more lonely in his life. Lexi woke at five A.M., sweating. The dreams were getting worse. She was six years old, walking along the street in Dark Harbor with her father, pushing a doll carriage. Max, adult and naked, ran up to the carriage and snatched the doll. Except it wasn\u0027t a doll, it was a baby. Their baby. He wrapped his hands around its tiny, fragile neck and started to choke it. Lexi was going into labor. Gabe was pushing her through the hospital corridors in a wheelchair. He spun the chair around and said: \"I know you\u0027re lying to me. Tell me the truth about Kruger-Brent and I can save you.\" \"Save me from what?\" Blood started gushing from between Lexi\u0027s legs, torrents and torrents of blood, till the hospital floor was no longer a floor but a thick, viscous red swimming pool. She was drowning, screaming for Gabe to help her, but he couldn\u0027t. \"I love you. But I can\u0027t go on.\" Weakly Lexi crawled out of bed and into the shower. Her appointment wasn\u0027t till this afternoon. How am I going to make it through the next ten hours? She rubbed shower gel all over her wet skin, washing not because she was dirty but because it was something to do. Cupping her breasts in her hands, she marveled at the weight of them. The baby - it - was about the size of a pinhead, but already her boobs were preparing to feed the five thousand. She wondered how long it would take them to go back to normal afterward. Days? Weeks? Her usually washboard-flat stomach now had a slight but pronounced curve to it, but it looked more like middle-aged spread than pregnancy. This wasn\u0027t her body. It was the body of a stranger. Soft. Maternal. All the things that Lexi was not. Could never be. She thought about Gabe. Maddeningly, the tears started to well up. She tried not to think of \"it\" as a baby, still less as Gabe\u0027s baby. Even so, the knowledge that she was about to destroy the last piece of what they\u0027d had together... Lexi put her head in her hands and sobbed. Goddamn these stupid hormones. All Lexi wanted was for the nightmare to be over. \"I see this is your second scheduled appointment with us?\" Lexi glared at the abortion-clinic receptionist. Are you asking me or telling me? \"You canceled a previous procedure on...\" She scrolled down her computer screen. \"On the tenth. Is that right?\" \"Yes.\" \"And what was the reason for the cancellation?\" Gee, well, let me think. I\u0027m throwing away my last chance at natural motherhood? I\u0027m killing the child of the man I love, the best thing that ever happened to me, not to mention my own baby? I\u0027m scared of hemorrhaging to death on the operating table like some kind of sacrificial lamb, being punished for all the sins that no one knows I\u0027ve committed? \"I had a business meeting.\" The receptionist raised an eyebrow. \"An important business meeting. It couldn\u0027t be rescheduled.\" \"Right. So you\u0027re quite sure about this afternoon\u0027s procedure?\" \"Quite sure.\" Lexi signed the consent forms. \"When can I go to my room?\" \"As soon as you\u0027re ready, Ms. Templeton. One of our nurses will show you through to the patient suites.\" The girl sighed as she watched Lexi disappear through the double doors. It didn\u0027t matter if it was a panicked teenager or a world-weary CEO, and it didn\u0027t matter how tough a front they put on. Abortion was always sad. Part of Lexi Templeton\u0027s heart would break today, never to recover. Next week, the receptionist decided, she would look for another job. The captain\u0027s voice rang out through the cabin speakers. \"I appreciate your patience, folks. We\u0027ve been asked to circle around for just a few more minutes. Should have you on the ground shortly.\" A collective groan from the passengers jolted Gabe awake. Through his tiny plastic window he could see New York sprawled out below. He wondered for the hundredth time what the hell he was doing coming back here. You know why you came. Because you had to. Your heart never left. \"We\u0027re running a little behind today.\" The nurse smiled sympathetically as she bustled about Lexi\u0027s room, drawing back the curtains and refilling the pitcher of water. \"You\u0027ll probably go down to the operating room at around four. Can I bring you some magazines? I\u0027m afraid we can\u0027t offer you anything to eat.\" Lexi smiled wryly. As if I could eat! Maybe something to read would help distract her. \"Do you have today\u0027s Wall Street Journal?\" \"Er...no. I\u0027m afraid not.\" The nurse looked apologetic. \"We have Vogue and InStyle. I think we may have the new Us Weekly. Would you like to see that?\" \"No thanks.\" Mindlessly, Lexi grabbed the remote and turned on CNN. Four o\u0027clock. Three whole hours. She\u0027d have written a check for a million dollars to jump the line and get it over with now. What use was it, having money, if it couldn\u0027t get you what you wanted? Gabe jumped into the cab. It was filthy and smelled of stale tacos. \"Park Avenue, please. The Kruger-Brent building.\" \"They ain\u0027t there no more.\" The cabdriver turned around. A blubbery whale of a Mexican, he had sweat patches under his arms the size of dinner plates. When he spoke, he blasted Gabe with taco breath. \"They went bust, remember? You don\u0027t watcha news?\" \"Right, right. I forgot.\" Of course. Lexi must have moved to new premises. But where? Gabe looked at his watch. It was three o\u0027clock already and he was dog tired. Maybe he should forget going to Lexi\u0027s office? He could go to his hotel, get some sleep and see her this evening at the apartment. \"You know what? I changed my mind. Just take me to the Plaza.\" \"You got it, boss. Plaza hotel it is.\" Lexi felt the medication course through her veins. The nurse said: \"You should start to feel a little woozy. Just relax. I\u0027ll be back to get you in half an hour.\" Lexi slumped back against the pillow. When the nurse was gone, she started to cry. I\u0027m sorry, baby. Outside, the nurses were talking. \"Even without makeup she\u0027s really pretty.\" \"I know. You\u0027d never think she was forty. You think she\u0027s had Botox?\" \"No way. You can always tell.\" \"Yeah, but with her money she could get, like, the best. Invisible.\" \"How rich is she, exactly?\" \"She bought Kruger-Brent for cash, so I\u0027m guessing Bill Gates-rich. You know, if I had tons of money and looked like she does, I\u0027d figure I had something to smile about. She looks so sad.\" \"C\u0027mon, Pearl, give her a break. She\u0027s here for an abortion. She\u0027s hardly gonna be doing cartwheels down the hall.\" \"I guess. I wonder who the daddy is?\" They ran through the list of Lexi\u0027s past lovers like they were discussing a character on a TV soap until the doctor arrived and put an end to the gossip. It didn\u0027t matter who the father was anyway. In a couple of hours, there would be no father. The doctor was a woman. Lexi wondered if she\u0027d ever been through an abortion herself. How do doctors get into this line of work anyway? \"Once the anesthetic is in, I want you to count backward from twenty. Okay?\" \"Okay.\" A sharp prick. \"Start counting.\" \"Twenty, nineteen...\" Lexi thought about her mother giving birth to her. Had she known she was going to die? That she would sacrifice her own life for the new life inside her? \"...fifteen, fourteen...\" Max\u0027s face. He was making love to her, violently, passionately. She was coming, screaming his name. \"...twelve, eleven...\" The light was fading. She could feel herself sinking, sliding deeper and deeper into the darkness. Gabe was here. He was talking to her. She could see his face, his lips moving, but she couldn\u0027t hear him. He was waving his arms around wildly, shouting. Something was wrong. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she murmured. \"I\u0027m sorry, Gabe.\" Then he was gone. At first she thought she was dreaming. Only when Gabe took her hand did she realize he was real. She was in bed in her room, the same room she\u0027d been in before the operation. Gabe was sitting by the bedside. \"What happened? Is it over?\" He kissed her on the forehead. \"You mean the operation? No. I wouldn\u0027t let them go through with it. I convinced the doctor that you were still unsure.\" Tears streamed down Lexi\u0027s face. \"Was I wrong? Do you want to get rid of our baby that badly?\" He looked anguished. \"It is our baby, isn\u0027t it?\" Lexi nodded miserably. \"How did you know I was here?\" Gabe told her how he\u0027d jumped on a plane in Cape Town, desperate to see her. \"I was going to my hotel, but I changed my mind at the last minute and swung by the old Templeton office.\" \"Kruger-Brent,\" Lexi said weakly. \"I know. I hoped you might have moved there, but I wasn\u0027t sure. Then I ran into August Sandford in the elevator. As soon as he saw me, his face changed. I knew there was something terribly wrong.\" \"August told you?\" \"Don\u0027t be mad. I forced it out of him. I got here as fast as I could, but they told me you were already in the operating room. My God.\" Gabe shook his head. \"If I\u0027d been thirty seconds later...Why didn\u0027t you tell me you were pregnant?\" Lexi reached out and touched his face. \"I didn\u0027t want to hurt you. I\u0027d already hurt you enough. I knew I couldn\u0027t keep it.\" Gabe\u0027s voice trembled. \"Why not? What are you so afraid of, Lexi?\" At last, it all poured out. Her terror of giving birth. Her certainty that, even if she lived, she would make a terrible mother. \"I\u0027m not like you,\" she sobbed. \"I\u0027m different. Max and I, we were both different. We were born with this...thing. Obsession, I suppose you\u0027d call it. Max wanted Kruger-Brent as much as I did. I killed him, Gabe.\" She put her head in her hands. \"When I took the company away from him, I signed his death warrant.\" All the grief she\u0027d been suppressing burst out of her like an exorcised demon. Lexi had hated Max for so long, she\u0027d convinced herself that all the love was gone. But it wasn\u0027t. Max\u0027s death was like a part of herself dying. She knew that now. Gabe let her finish. Once she\u0027d cried herself out, he said gently: \"You didn\u0027t kill Max Webster. The man was ill. He killed himself.\" \"But, Gabe, you don\u0027t know. You don\u0027t know me. I\u0027ve done some terrible things. Unforgivable things.\" \"Nothing is unforgivable.\" Gabe stroked her hair. \"That\u0027s why I got on the plane. Whatever you\u0027ve done, Lexi, I don\u0027t care. I love you. I love you as you are.\" \"But, Gabe, you don\u0027t know. You don\u0027t know what I\u0027ve done.\" \"No, and I don\u0027t care. I thought I wanted the truth, but I don\u0027t. The past is the past and it can\u0027t be changed. It\u0027s the future I\u0027m interested in.\" He reached down and stroked her belly. \"Our future. Have the baby, Lex. Marry me. I know Kruger-Brent will always come first. But I\u0027ll take second if that\u0027s what it takes to be with you.\" He opened his arms. Lexi fell into them, clinging to him for dear life. She loved him so much, it terrified her. As for the baby... \"I\u0027m frightened, Gabe,\" she said at last, pulling away. \"My mother died giving birth to me. My grandmother died giving birth to her. It\u0027s not even death I\u0027m afraid of. It\u0027s dying before I\u0027ve had a chance to make Kruger-Brent great again.\" Gabe looked at her with a mixture of wonder and pity. The tragedy is, she means it. \"You\u0027re not going to die, Lexi. Marry me.\" I can\u0027t. It will never work. There\u0027s so much you don\u0027t know about me. So much you must never know. \"Yes.\" Gabe\u0027s face lit up. \"Seriously? You will?\" \"Yes!\" Lexi was crying and laughing, touching and kissing him everywhere, unable to let him go. \"Yes, I\u0027ll marry you. I love you so much, Gabe.\" She knew she didn\u0027t deserve a happy ending. But she wanted one so badly. Kruger-Brent. Gabe. A baby. At last, Lexi Templeton was going to have it all. Eve knew the end was coming. She could feel death all around her, a smothering blanket she could not shake off. Panic surged up in her throat like vomit. No! Not yet! It\u0027s not my time. Please! I haven\u0027t finished. She was young and beautiful, far more beautiful than Alex. Men fought one another for the privilege of going to bed with her. She was a goddess, rich, blessed, untouchable. Then the ghosts came in and spoiled it all. Kate Blackwell, her grandmother. You\u0027re a wicked child, Eve. Alexandra shall inherit Kruger-Brent. You will get nothing. Keith Webster. It\u0027s just a minor operation, to get rid of those fine lines around your eyes. You mustn\u0027t worry, darling. I\u0027ll take care of you. Max, her gypsy boy, her savior. We\u0027re going under, Mother! Someone\u0027s short-selling our stock. There\u0027s nothing I can do. Fools, all of them. Thieves, liars and fools! Kate Blackwell was pressing the blanket down over Eve\u0027s face. She couldn\u0027t breathe. Overwhelmed with terror, Eve felt her bowels opening. She caught the rancid smell of her own filth, felt the sticky wetness on her legs and back. No! Not now! Not like this! With her last ounce of strength, Eve pushed her grandmother off. She reached into the bedside drawer, her gnarled fingers scrabbling desperately for pen and paper. She started to write, a frenzied, barely legible scrawl. Folding the paper over, she wrote a name on the back. Almost there... Keith Webster snatched the pen from her hand. George Mellis held her down. The last thing Eve saw was Kate Blackwell walking toward her with the blanket of death in her hands. The old bitch was smiling.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mistress-of-the-game/page-28.html","bookId":2372,"book":{"id":2372,"title":"Mistress of the Game","description":"Storyline: Sidney Sheldon\u0027s Mistress of the Game is a 2009 novel by Tilly Bagshawe.
