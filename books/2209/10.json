When he spoke, often she wasn\u0027t answer him, and one could hardly tell if it was contempt or that she didn\u0027t hear. .And our fragile domestic tranquility erupted with his outrage. He did not have to be loved, but he would not be ignored; and once he even dew at her, shouting that he would slap her, and I found myself in the wretched position of fighting him as I\u0027d done years before she\u0027d come to us.\u0027She\u0027s not a child any longer,\u0027 I whispered to him.\u0027I don\u0027t know what it is. She\u0027s a woman.\u0027 I urged him to take it lightly, and he affected disdain and ignored her in turn. But one evening he came in flustered and told me she\u0027d followed him though she\u0027d refused to go with him to kill, she\u0027d followed him afterwards.\u0027What\u0027s the matter with her!\u0027 he flared at me, as though rd given birth to her and must know.\\n\\n \"And then one night our servants vanished. Two of the best maids we\u0027d ever retained, a mother and daughter. The coachman was sent to their house only to report they\u0027d disappeared, and then the father was at our door, pounding the knocker. He stood back on the brick sidewalk regarding me with that grave suspicion that sooner or later crept into the faces of all mortals who-knew us for any length of time, the forerunner of death, as pallor might be to a fatal fever; and I tried to explain to him they had not been here, mother or daughter, and we must begin some search.\\n\\n \"\u0027It\u0027s she!\u0027 Lestat hissed from the shadows when I shut the gate.\u0027She\u0027s done something to them and brought risk for us all. I\u0027ll make her tell me!\u0027 And he pounded up the spiral stairs from the courtyard. I knew that she\u0027d gone, slipped out while I was at the gate, and I knew something else also: that a vague stench came across the courtyard from the shut, unused kitchen, a stench that mingled uneasily with the honeysuckle-the stench of graveyards. I heard Lestat coming down as I approached the warped shutters, locked with rust to the small brick building. No food was ever prepared there, no work ever done, so that it lay like an old brick vault under the tangles of honeysuckle. The shutters came loose, the nails having turned to dust, and I heard Lestat\u0027s gasp as we stepped into the reeking dark. There they lay on the bricks, mother and daughter together, the arm of the mother fastened around the waist of the daughter, the daughter\u0027s head bent against the mother\u0027s breast, both foul with feces and swarming with \u0027 . A great cloud of gnats rose as the shutter fell back, and I waved them away from me in a convulsive disgust. Ants crawled undisturbed over the eyelids, the mouths of the dead pair, and in the moonlight I could see the endless map of silvery paths of snails.\u0027Damn her!\u0027 Lestat burst out, and I grabbed his arm and held him fast, pitting all my strength against him.\u0027What do you mean to do with her)\u0027 I insisted.\u0027What can you do? She\u0027s not a child anymore that will do what we say simply because we say it. We must teach her.\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027She knows!\u0027 He stood back from me brushing his coat.\u0027She knows! She\u0027s known for years what to dot What can be risked and what cannot. I won\u0027t have her do this without my permission) I won\u0027t tolerate it.\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027Then, are you master off us all? You didn\u0027t teach her that. Was she supposed to imbibe it from my quiet subservience? I don\u0027t think so. She sees herself as equal to us now, and us as equal to each other. I tell you we must reason with her, instruct her to respect what is ours. As all of us should respect it.\u0027\\n\\n \"He stalked off, obviously absorbed in what rd said, though he would give no admission of it to me. And he took his vengeance to the city. Yet when he came home, fatigued and satiated, she was still not there. He sat against the velvet arm of the couch and stretched his long legs out on the length of it.\u0027Did you bury them?\u0027 he asked me.\\n\\n \"\u0027They\u0027re gone,\u0027 I said. I did not care to say even to myself that I had burned their remains in the old unused kitchen stove.\u0027But there is the father to deal with, and the brother,\u0027 I said to him. I feared his temper. I wished at once to plan some way to quickly dispose of the whole problem. But he said now that the father and the brother were no more, that death had come to dinner in their small house near the ramparts and stayed to say grace when everyone was done.\u0027Wine,\u0027 he whispered now, running his finger on his lip.\u0027Both of them had drunk too much wine. I found myself tapping the fence posts with a stick to make a tune,\u0027 he laughed.\u0027But I don\u0027t like it, the dizziness. Do you like it?\u0027 And when he looked at me I had to smile at him because the wine was working in him and he was mellow; and in that moment when his face looked warm and reasonable, I leaned over and said,\u0027I hear Claudia\u0027s tap on the stairs. Be gentle with her. It\u0027s all done.\u0027\\n\\n \"She came in then, with her bonnet ribbons undone and her little boots caked with dirt. I watched them tensely, Lestat with a sneer on his lips, she as unconscious of him as if he weren\u0027t there. She had a bouquet of white chrysanthemums in her arms, such a large bouquet it made her all the more a small child. Her bonnet fell back now, hung on her shoulder for an instant, and then fell to the carpet. And all through her golden hair I saw the narrow petals of the chrysanthemums. \u0027Tomorrow is the Feast of All Saints,\u0027 she said.\u0027Do you know?\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027Yes,\u0027 I said to her. It is the day in New Orleans when all the faithful go to the cemeteries to care for the graves of their loved ones. They whitewash the plaster walls of the vaults, clean the names cut into the marble slabs. And finally they deck the tombs with flowers. In the St. Louis Cemetery, which was very near our house, in which all the great Louisiana families were buried, in which my own brother was buried, there were even little iron benches set before the graves where the families might sit to receive the other families who had come to the cemetery for the same purpose. It was a festival in New Orleans; a celebration of death, it might have seemed to tourists who didn\u0027t understand it, but it was a celebration of the life after.\u0027I bought this from one of the vendors,\u0027 Claudia said. Her voice was soft and inscrutable. Her eyes opaque and without emotion.\\n\\n \" \u0027For the two you left in the kitchen!\u0027 Lestat said fiercely. She turned to him for the first time, but she said nothing. She stood there staring at him as if she\u0027d never seen him before. And then she took several steps towards him and looked at him, still as if she were positively examining him. I moved forward. I could feel his anger. Her coldness. And now she turned to me. And then, looking from one to the other of us, she asked:\\n\\n \"\u0027Which of you did it? Which of you made me what I am?\u0027\\n\\n \"I could not have been more astonished at anything she might have said or done. And yet it was inevitable that her long silence would thus be broken. She seemed very little concerned with me, though. Her eyes fixed on Lestat.\u0027You speak of us as if we always existed as we are now,\u0027 she said, her voice soft, measured, the child\u0027s tone rounded with the woman\u0027s seriousness.\u0027You speak of them out there as mortals, us as vampires. But it was not always so. Louis had a mortal sister, I remember her. And there is a picture of her in his trunk. I\u0027ve seen him look at it! He was mortal the same as she; and so was I. Why else this size, this shape?\u0027 She opened her arms now and let the chrysanthemums fall to the floor. I whispered her name. I think I meant to distract her. It was impossible. The tide had turned. Lestat\u0027s eyes burned with a keen fascination, a malignant pleasure:\\n\\n \"\u0027You made us what we are, didn\u0027t you?\u0027 she accused him.\\n\\n \"He raised his eyebrows now in mock amazement.\u0027What you are?\u0027 he asked.\u0027And would you be something other than what you are!\u0027 He drew up his knees and leaned forward, his eyes narrow.\u0027Do you know how long it\u0027s been? Can you picture yourself? Must I find a hag to show you your mortal countenance now if I had let you alone?\u0027\\n\\n \"She turned away from him, stood for a moment as if she had no idea what she would do, and then she moved towards the chair beside the fireplace and, climbing on it, curled up like the most helpless child. She brought her knees up close to her, her velvet coat open, her silk dress tight around her knees, and she stared at the ashes in the hearth. But there was nothing helpless about her stare. Her eyes had independent life, as if the body were possessed.\\n\\n \" \u0027You could be dead by now if you were mortal!\u0027 Lestat insisted to her, pricked by her silence. He drew his legs around and set his boots on the floor.\u0027Do you hear me? Why do you ask me this now? Why do you make such a thing of it? You\u0027ve known all your life you\u0027re a vampire.\u0027 And so he went on in a tirade, saying much the same things he\u0027d said to me many times over: know your nature, kill, be what you are. But all of this seemed strangely beside the point. For Claudia had no qualms about killing. She sat back now and let her head roll slowly to where she could see him across from her. She was studying him again, as if he were a puppet on strings.\u0027Did you do it to me? And how?\u0027 she asked, her eyes narrowing.\u0027How did you do it?\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027And why should I tell you? It\u0027s my power.\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027Why yours alone?\u0027 she asked, her voice icy, her eyes heartless.\u0027How was it done?\u0027 she demanded suddenly in rage.\\n\\n \"It was electric. He rose from the couch, and I was on my feet immediately, facing him.\u0027Stop here\u0027 he said to me. He wrung his hands. \u0027Do something about her! I can\u0027t endure her?\u0027 And then he started for the door, but turned and, coming back, drew very close so that he towered over Claudia, putting- her in a deep shadow. She glared up at him fearlessly, her eyes moving back and forth over his face with total detachment.\u0027I can undo what I did. Both to you and to him,\u0027 he said to her, his finger pointing at me across the room.\u0027Be glad I made you what you are,\u0027 he sneered.\u0027Or I\u0027ll break you in a thousand pieces!\"\u0027\\n\\n \"Well, the peace of the house was destroyed, though there was quiet. Days passed and she asked no questions, though now she was deep into books of the occult, of witches and witchcraft, and of vampires. This was mostly fancy, you understand. Myth, tales, sometimes mere romantic horror tales. But she read it all. Till dawn she read, so that I had to go and collect her and bring her to bed.\\n\\n \"Lestat, meantime, hired a butler and maid and had a team of workers in to make a great fountain in the courtyard with a stone nymph pouring water eternal from a widemouthed shell. He had goldfish brought and boxes of rooted water lilies set into the fountain so their blossoms rested upon the surface and shivered in the ever-moving water.\\n\\n \"A woman had seen him kill on the Nyades Road, which ran to the town of Carrolton, and there were stories of it in the papers, associating him with a haunted house near Nyades and Melpomene, all of which delighted him. He was the Nyades Road ghost for some time, though it finally fell to the back pages; and then he performed another grisly murder in another public place and set the imagination of New Orleans to working. But all this had about it some quality of fear. He was pensive, suspicious, drew close to me constantly to ask where Claudia was, where she\u0027d gone, and what she was doing.\\n\\n \"\u0027She\u0027ll be all right,\u0027 I assured him, though I was estranged from her and in agony, as if she\u0027d been my bride. She hardly saw me now, as she\u0027d not seen Lestat before, and she might walk away while I spoke to her.\\n\\n \"\u0027She had better be all right!\" he said nastily.\\n\\n \"\u0027And what will you do if she\u0027s not?\u0027 I asked, more in fear than accusation.\\n\\n \"He looked up at me, with his cold gray eyes.\u0027You take care of her, Louis. You talk to her!\u0027 he said.\u0027Everything was perfect, and now this. There\u0027s no need for it\u0027\\n\\n \"But it was my choice to let her come to me, and she did. It was early one evening when I\u0027d just awakened. The house was dark. I saw her standing by the French windows; she wore puffed sleeves and a pink sash, and was watching with lowered lashes the evening rush in the Rue Royale. I could hear Lestat in his room, the sound of water splashing from his pitcher. The faint smell of his cologne came and went like the sound of music from the cafe two doors down from us.\u0027He\u0027ll tell me nothing,\u0027 she said softly. I hadn\u0027t realized she knew that I had opened my eyes. I came towards her and knelt beside her.\u0027You\u0027ll tell me, won\u0027t you? How it was done.\u0027\\n\\n \" \u0027Is this what you truly want to know?\u0027 I asked, searching her face.\u0027Or is it why it was done to you... and what you were before? I don\u0027t understand what you mean by \"how,\" for if you mean how was it done so that you in turn may do it....\\n\\n \"\u0027I don\u0027t even know what it is. What you\u0027re saying,\u0027 she said with a touch of coldness. Then she turned full around and put her hands on my face.\u0027Kill with me tonight,\u0027 she whispered as sensuously as a lover.\u0027And tell me all that you know. What are we? Why are we not like them?\u0027 She looked down into the street.\\n\\n \"\u0027I don\u0027t know the answers to your questions,\u0027 I said to her. Her face contorted suddenly, as if she were straining to hear me over a sudden noise. And then she shook her head. But I went on.\u0027I wonder the same things you wonder. I do not know. How I was made, I\u0027ll tell you that... that Lestat did it to me. But the real \"how\" of it, I don\u0027t know!\u0027 Her face had that same look of strain. I was seeing in it the first traces of fear, or something worse and deeper than fear. \u0027Claudia,\u0027 I said to her, putting my hands over her hands and pressing them gently against my skin.\u0027Lestat has one wise thing to tell you. Don\u0027t ask these questions. You\u0027ve been my companion for countless years in my search for all that I could learn of mortal life and mortal creation. Don\u0027t be my companion now in this anxiety. He can\u0027t give us the answers. And I have none.\u0027\\n\\n \"I could see she could not accept this, but I hadn\u0027t expected the convulsive turning away, the violence with which she tore at her own hair for an instant and then stopped as if the gesture were useless, stupid. It filled me with apprehension. She was looking at the sky. It was smoky, starless, the clouds blowing fast from the direction of the river. She made a sudden movement of her lips as if she\u0027d bitten into them, then she turned to me and, still whispering, she said,\u0027Then he made me... he did it... you did not!\u0027 There was something so dreadful about her expression, I\u0027d left her before I meant to do it. I was standing before the fireplace lighting a single candle in front of the tall mirror. And there suddenly, I saw something which startled me, gathering out of the gloom first as a hideous mask, then becoming its three-dimensional reality: a weathered skull. I stared at it. It smelled faintly of the earth still, but had been scrubbed.\u0027Why don\u0027t you answer me?\u0027 she was asking. I heard Lestat\u0027s door open. He would go out to kill at once, at least to fund the kill. I would not.\\n\\n \"I would let the first hours of the evening accumulate in quiet, as hunger accumulated in me, till the drive grew almost too strong, so that I might give myself to it all the more completely, blindly. I heard her question again clearly, as though it had been floating in the air like the reverberation of a bell... and felt my heart pounding.\u0027He did make me, of course! He said so himself. But you hide something from me. Something he hints at when I question him. He says that it could not have been done without you!\u0027\\n\\n \"I found myself staring at the skull, yet hearing her as if the words were lashing me, lashing me to make me tam around and face the lash. The thought went through me more like a flash of cold than a thought, that nothing should remain of me now but such a skull. I turned around and saw in the light from the street her eyes, like two dark flames in her white face. A doll from whom someone had cruelly ripped the eyes and replaced them with a demonic fire. I found myself moving towards her, whispering her name, some thought forming on my lips, then dying, coming towards her, then away from her, fussing for her coat and her hat. I saw a tiny glove on the door which was phosphorescent in the shadows, and for just a moment I thought it a tiny, severed hand.\\n\\n \"\u0027What\u0027s the matter with you... ?\u0027 She drew nearer, looking up into my face.\u0027What has always been the matter? Why do you stare at the skull like that, at the glover She asked this gently, but... not gently enough.\\n\\n \"There was a slight calculation in her voice, an unreachable detachment.\\n\\n \" \u0027I need you,\u0027 I said to her, without wanting to say it.\u0027I cannot bear to lose you. You\u0027re the only companion I have in immortality.\u0027\\n\\n \" \u0027But surely there must be others! Surely we are not the only vampires on earths\u0027 I heard her saying it as I had said it, heard my own words coming back to me now on the tide of her self-awareness, her searching. But there\u0027s no pain, I thought suddenly. There\u0027s urgency, heartless urgency. I looked down at her.\u0027Aren\u0027t you the same as I?\u0027 She looked at me.\u0027You\u0027ve taught me all I know!\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027Lestat taught you to kill.\u0027 I fetched the glove.\u0027here, come... let\u0027s go out. I want to go out....\\n\\n I was stammering, trying to force the gloves on her. I lifted the great curly mass of her hair and placed it gently over her coat.\u0027But you taught me to see!\u0027 she said.\u0027You taught me the words vampire eyes,\u0027 she said.\u0027You taught me to drink the world, to hunger for more than... \u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027I never meant those words that way, vampire eyes,\u0027 I said to her.\u0027It has a different ring when you say it...\u0027 She was tugging at me, trying to make me look at her.\u0027Come,\u0027 I said to her,\u0027I\u0027ve something to show you...\u0027 And quickly I led her down the passage and down the spiral stairs through the dark courtyard. But I no more knew what I had to show her, really, than I knew where I was going. Only that I had to move toward it with a sublime and doomed instinct.\\n\\n \"We rushed through the early evening city, the sky overhead a pale violet now that the clouds were gone, the stars small and faint, the air around us sultry and fragrant even as we moved away from the spacious gardens, towards those mean and narrow streets where the flowers erupt in the cracks of the stones, and the huge oleander shoots out thick, waxen stems of white and pink blooms, like a monstrous weed in the empty lots. I heard the staccato of Claudia\u0027s steps as she rushed beside me, never once asking me to slacken my pace; and she stood finally, her face infinitely patient, looking up at me in a dark and narrow sheet where a few old slope-roofed French houses remained among the Spanish facades, ancient little houses, the plaster blistered from the moldering brick beneath. I had found the house now by a blind effort, aware that I had always known where it was and avoided it, always turned before this dark lampless corner, not wishing to pass the low window where I\u0027d first heard Claudia cry. The house was standing still. Sunk lower than it was in those days, the alley way crisscrossed with sagging cords of laundry, the weeds high along the low foundation, the two dormer windows broken and patched with cloth. I touched the shutters.\u0027It was here I first saw you,\u0027 I said to her, thinking to tell it to her so she would understand, yet feeling now the chill of her gaze, the distance of her stare.\u0027I heard you crying. You were there in a room with your mother. And -your mother was dead. Dead for days, and you didn\u0027t know. You clung to her, whining . crying pitifully, your body white and feverish and hungry. You were trying to wake her from the dead, you were hugging her for warmth, for fear. It was almost morning and... \u0027\\n\\n \"I put my hand to my temples.\u0027I opened the shutters... I came into the room. I felt pity for you. Pity. But.... something else.\u0027\\n\\n \"I saw her lips slack, her eyes wide.\u0027You... fed on me?\u0027 she whispered.\u0027I was your victim!\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027Yes!\u0027 I said to her.\u0027I did it.\u0027\\n\\n \"There was a moment so elastic and painful as to be unbearable. She stood stark-still in the shadows, her huge eyes gathering the light, the warm air rising suddenly with a soft noise. And then she turned. I heard the clicking of her slippers as she ran. And ran. And ran. I stood frozen, hearing the sound grow smaller and smaller; and then I turned,, the fear in me unraveling, growing huge and insurmountable, and I ran after her. It was unthinkable that I not catch her, that I not overtake her at once and tell her that I loved her, must have her, must keep her, and every second that I ran headlong down the dark street after her was like her slipping away from me drop by drop; my heart was pounding, unfed, pounding and rebelling against the strain. Until I came suddenly to a dead stop, She stood beneath a lamppost, staring mutely, as if she didn\u0027t know me. I took her small waist in both hand; and lifted her into the light. She studied me, her face contorted, her head turning as if she wouldn\u0027t give me her direct glance, as if she must deflect an overpowering feeling of revulsion.\u0027You killed me,\u0027 she whispered\u0027You took my life!\u0027\\n\\n \" \u0027Yes,\u0027 I said to her, holding her so that I cook feel her heart pounding.\u0027Rather, I tried to take it. To drink it away. But you had a heart like no other hear I\u0027ve ever felt, a heart that beat and beat until I had to let you go, had to cast you away from me lest you quickened my pulse till I would die. And it was Lestat who found me out; Louis the sentimentalist, the fool feasting on a golden-haired child, a Holy Innocent a little girl. He brought you back from the hospital where they\u0027d put you, and I never knew what he mean to do except teach me my nature. \"Take her, finish it,\" he said. And I felt that passion for you again (r)h, I know I\u0027ve lost you now forever. I can see it ix your eyes! You look at me as you look at mortals from aloft, from some region of cold self-sufficiency l can\u0027t understand. But I did it. I felt it for you again, vile unsupportable hunger for your hammering heart this cheek, this skin. You were pink and fragrant a! mortal children are, sweet with the bite of salt and dust, I held you again, I took you again. And when I though your heart would kill me and I didn\u0027t care, he parted us and, gashing his own wrist, gave it to you to drink. And drink you did. And drink and drink until you nearly drained him and he was reeling. But you were a vampire then. And that very night you drank a human\u0027s blood and have every night thereafter.\u0027\\n\\n \"Her face had not changed. The flesh was like the wax of ivory candles; only the eyes showed life. There was nothing more to say to her. I set her down.\u0027I took your life,\u0027 I said.\u0027He gave it back to you.\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027And here it is,\u0027 she said under her breath.\u0027And I hate you both!\"\u0027\\n\\n The vampire stopped.\\n\\n \"But why did you tell her?\" asked the boy after a respectful pause.\\n\\n \"How could I not tell her?\" The vampire looked up in mild astonishment. \"She had to know it. She had to weigh one thing against the other. It was not as if Lestat had taken her full from life as he had taken me; I had stricken her. She would have died! There would have been no mortal life for her. But what\u0027s the difference? For all of us it\u0027s a matter of years, dying! So what she saw more graphically then was what all men knew: that death will come inevitably, unless one chooses... this!\" He opened his white hands now and looked at the palms.\\n\\n \"And did you lose her? Did she go?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/interview-with-the-vampire-the-vampire-chronicles-1/page-10.html","bookId":2209,"book":{"id":2209,"title":"Interview with the Vampire (The Vampire Chronicles #1)","description":"Storyline: Interview With The Vampire (The Vampire Chronicles #1) \\n Here are the confessions of a vampire.
