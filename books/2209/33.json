He bowed his head at that moment as if he were defeated. And something in the way that he felt that defeat, something in the way his smooth white face reflected it only for an instant, reminded me of someone else I\u0027d seen defeated in just that way. And it was amazing to me that it took me such a long moment to see Claudia\u0027s face in that attitude; Claudia, as she stood by the bed in the room at the Hotel Saint-Gabriel pleading with me to transform Madeleine into one of us. That same helpless look, that defeat which seemed to be so heartfelt that everything beyond it was forgotten. And then he, like Claudia, seemed to rally, to pull on some reserve of strength. But he said softly to the air,\u0027I am dying!\u0027\\n\\n \"And I, watching him, hearing him, the only creature under God who heard him, knowing completely that it was true, said nothing.\\n\\n \"A long sigh escaped his lips. His head was\u0027 bowed. His right hand lay limp beside him in the grass.\u0027Hatred.... that is passion,\u0027 he said\u0027Revenge, that is passion.. \u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027Not from me... \u0027 I murmured softly.\u0027Not now.\u0027\\n\\n \"And then his eyes fixed on me and his face seemed very calm.\u0027I used to believe you would get over it, that when the pain of all of it left you, you would grow warm again and filled with love, and filled with that wild and insatiable curiosity with which you first came to me, that inveterate conscience, and that hunger for knowledge that brought you all the way to Paris to my cell. I thought it was a part of you that couldn\u0027t die. And I thought that when the pain was gone you would forgive me for what part I played in her death. She never loved you, you know. Not in the way that I loved you, and the way that you loved us both. I knew this! I understood it! And I believed I would gather you to me and hold you. And time would open to us, and we would be the teachers of one another. All the things that gave you happiness would give me happiness; and I would be the protector of your pain. My power would be your power. My strength the same. But you\u0027re dead inside to me, you\u0027re cold and beyond my reach! It is as if I\u0027m not here, beside you. And, not being here with you, I have the dreadful feeling that I don\u0027t exist at all. And you are as cold and distant from me as those strange modern paintings of lines and hard forms that I cannot love or comprehend, as alien as those hard mechanical sculptures of this age which have no human form. I shudder when I\u0027m near you. I look into your eyes and my reflection isn\u0027t there...\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027What you asked was impossible!\u0027 I said quickly.\u0027Don\u0027t you see? What I asked was impossible, too, from the start.\u0027\\n\\n \"He protested, the negation barely forming on his lips, his hand rising as if to thrust it away.\\n\\n \"\u0027I wanted love and goodness in this which is living death,\u0027 I said.\u0027It was impossible from the beginning, because you cannot have love and goodness when you do what you know to be evil, what you know to be wrong. You can only have the desperate confusion and longing and the chasing of phantom goodness in its human form. I knew the real answer to my quest before I ever reached Paris. I knew it when I first took a human life to feed my craving. It was my death. And yet I would not accept it, could not accept it, because like all creatures I don\u0027t wish to die! And so I sought for other vampires, for Cod, for the devil, for a hundred things under a hundred names. And it was all the same, all evil. And all wrong. Because no one could in any guise convince me of what I myself knew to be true, that I was damned in my own mind and soul. And when I came to Paris I thought you were powerful and beautiful and without regret, and I wanted that desperately. But you were a destroyer just as I was a destroyer, more ruthless and cunning even than I. You showed me the only thing that I could really hope to become, what depth of evil, what degree of coldness I would have to attain to end my pain. And I accepted that. And so that passion, that love you saw in me, was extinguished. And you see now simply a mirror of yourself.\u0027\\n\\n \"A very long time passed before he spoke. He\u0027d risen to his feet, and he stood with his back to me looking down the river, head bowed as before, his hands at his sides. I was looking at the river also. I was thinking quietly, There is nothing more I can say, nothing more I can do.\\n\\n \"\u0027Louis,\u0027 he said now, lifting his head, his voice very thick and unlike itself.\\n\\n \"\u0027Yes, Armand,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \"\u0027Is there anything else you want of me, anything else you require?\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027No,\u0027 I said.\u0027What do you mean?\u0027\\n\\n \"He didn\u0027t answer this. He began to slowly walk away. I think at first I thought he only meant to walk a few paces, perhaps to wander by himself along the muddy beach below. And by the time I realized that he was leaving me, he was a mere speck down there against the occasional flickering in the water under the moon. I never saw him again.\\n\\n \"Of course, it was several nights later before I realized he was gone. His coffin remained. But he did not return to it. And it was several months before I had that coffin taken to the St. Louis cemetery and put into the crypt beside my own. The grave, long neglected because my family was gone, received the only thing he\u0027d left behind. But then I began to be uncomfortable with that. I thought of it on waking, and again at dawn right before I closed my eyes. And I went downtown one night and took the coffin out, and broke it into pieces and left it in the narrow aisle of the cemetery in the tall grass.\\n\\n \"That vampire who was Lestat\u0027s latest child accosted me one evening not long after. He begged me to tell him all I knew of the world, to become his companion and his teacher. I remember telling him that what I chiefly knew was that I\u0027d destroy him if I ever saw him again.\u0027You see, someone must die every night that I walk, until I\u0027ve the courage to end it,\u0027 I told him.\u0027And you\u0027re an admirable choice for that victim, a killer as evil as myself.\u0027\\n\\n \"And I left New Orleans the next night because the sorrow wasn\u0027t leaving me. And I didn\u0027t want to think of that old house where Lestat was dying. Or that sharp, modem vampire who\u0027d fled me. Or of Armand.\\n\\n \"I wanted to be where there was nothing familiar to me. And nothing mattered.\\n\\n \"And that\u0027s the end of it. There\u0027s nothing else.\"\\n\\n The boy sat mute, staring at the vampire. And the vampire sat collected, his hands folded on the table, his narrow, red-rimmed eyes fixed on the turning tapes. His face was so gaunt now that the veins of his temples showed as if carved out of stone. And he sat so still that only his green eyes evinced life, and that life was a dull fascination with the turning of the tapes.\\n\\n Then the boy drew back and ran the fingers of his right hand loosely through his hair. \"No,\" he said with a short intake of breath. Then he said it again louder, \"No!\"\u0027\\n\\n The vampire didn\u0027t appear to bear him. His eyes moved away from the tapes towards the window, towards the dark, gray sky.\\n\\n \"It didn\u0027t have to end like that!\" said the boy, leaning forward.\\n\\n The vampire, who continued to look at the sky, uttered a short, dry laugh.\\n\\n \"All the things you felt in Paris!\" said the boy, his voice increasing in volume. \"The love of Claudia, the feeling, even the feeling for Lestat! It didn\u0027t have to end, not in this, not in despair! Because that\u0027s what it is, isn\u0027t it? Despair!\"\\n\\n \"Stop,\" said the vampire abruptly, lifting his right hand. His eyes shifted almost mechanically to the boy\u0027s face. \"I tell you and I have told you, that it could not have ended any other way.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t accept it,\" said the boy, and he folded his arms across his chest, shaking his head emphatically. \"I can\u0027t!\" And the emotion seemed to build in him, so that without meaning to, he scraped his chair back on the bare boards and rose to pace the floor. But then, when he turned and looked at the vampire\u0027s face again, the words he was about to speak died in his throat. The vampire was merely staring at him, and his face had that long drawn expression of both outrage and bitter amusement.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you see how you made it sound? It was an adventure like I\u0027ll never know in my whole life! You talk about passion, you talk about longing! You talk about things that millions of us won\u0027t ever taste or come to understand. And then you tell me it ends like that. I tell you... \" And he stood over the vampire now, his hands outstretched before him. \"If you were to give me that power! The power to see and feel and live forever!\"\\n\\n The vampire\u0027s eyes slowly began to widen, his lips parting. \"What!\" he demanded softly. \" What!\"\\n\\n \"Give it to me!\" said the boy, his right hand tightening in a fist, the fist pounding his chest. \"Make me a vampire now!\" he said as the vampire stared aghast.\\n\\n What happened then was swift and confused, but it ended abruptly with the vampire on his feet holding the boy by the shoulders, the boy\u0027s moist face contorted with fear, the vampire glaring at him in rage. \"This is what you want?\" he whispered, his pale lips manifesting only the barest trace of movement. \"This... after all I\u0027ve told you... is what you ask for?\"\\n\\n A small cry escaped the boy\u0027s lips, and he began to tremble all over, the sweat breaking out on his forehead and on the skin above his upper lip. His hand reached gingerly for the vampire\u0027s arm. \"You don\u0027t know what human life is like!.\" he said, on the edge of breaking into tears. \"You\u0027ve forgotten. You don\u0027t even understand the meaning of your own story, what it means to a human being like me.\" And then a choked sob interrupted his words, and his fingers clung to the vampire\u0027s arm.\\n\\n \"God,\" the vampire uttered and, turning away from him, almost pushed the boy off-balance against the wall. Ire stood with his back to the boy, staring at the gray window.\\n\\n \"I beg you... give it all one more chance. One more chance in me!\" said the boy.\\n\\n The vampire turned to him, his face as twisted with anger as before. And then, gradually, it began to become smooth. The lids came down slowly over his eyes and his lips lengthened in a smile. He looked again at the boy. \"I\u0027ve failed,\" he sighed, smiling still. \"I have completely failed. . \"\\n\\n \"No... \" the boy protested.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t say any more,\" said the vampire emphatically. \"I have but one chance left. Do you see the reels? They still turn. I have but one way to show you the meaning of what I\u0027ve said.\" And then he reached out for the boy so fast that the boy found himself grasping for something, pushing against something that was not there, so his hand was outstretched still when the vampire had him pressed to his chest, the boy\u0027s neck bent beneath his lips. \"Do you see?\" whispered the vampire, and the long, silky lips drew up over his teeth and two long fangs came down into the boy\u0027s flesh. The boy stuttered, a low guttural sound coming out of his throat, his hand struggling to close on something, his eyes widening only to become dull and gray as the vampire drank. And the vampire meantime looked as tranquil as someone in sleep. His narrow chest heaved so subtly with his sigh that he seemed to be rising slowly from the floor and then settling again with that same somnambulistic grace. There was a whine coming from the boy, and when the vampire let him go he held him out with both hands and looked at the damp white face, the limp hands, the eyes half closed.\\n\\n The boy was moaning, his lower lip loose and trembling as if in nausea. He moaned again louder, and his head fell back and his eyes rolled up into his head. The vampire set him down gently in the chair. The boy was straggling to speak, and the tears which sprang now to his eyes seemed to come as much from that effort to speak as from anything . else. His head fell forward, heavily, drunkenly, and his hand rested on the table. The vampire stood looking down at him, and his white skin became a soft luminous pink. It was as if a pink light were shining on him and his entire being seemed to give back that light. The flesh of his lips was dark, almost rose in color, and the veins of his temples and his hands were mere traces on his skin, and his face was youthful and smooth.\\n\\n \"Will I... die?\" the boy whispered as he looked up slowly, his mouth wet and slack. \"Will I die?\" he groaned, his lip trembling.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" the vampire said, and he smiled.\\n\\n The boy seemed on the verge of saying something more, but the hand that rested on the table slid forward on the boards, and his head lay down beside it as he lost consciousness.\\n\\n When next he opened his eyes, the boy saw the sun. It filled the dirty, undressed window and was hot on the side of his face and his hand. For a moment, he lay there, his face against the table and then with a great effort, he straightened, took a long deep breath and closing his eyes, pressed his hand to that place where the vampire had drawn blood. When his other hand accidentally touched a band of metal on the top of the tape recorder, he let out a sudden cry because the metal was hot.\\n\\n Then he rose, moving clumsily, almost falling, until he rested both his hands on the white wash basin. Quickly he turned on the tap, splashed his face with cold water, and wiped it with a soiled towel that hung there on a nail. He was breathing regularly now and he stood still, looking into the mirror without any support. Then he looked at his watch. It was as if the watch shocked him, brought him more to life than the sun or the water. And he made a quick search of the room, of the hallway, and, finding nothing and no one, he settled again into the chair. Then, drawing a small white pad out of his pocket, and a pen, he set these on the table and touched the button of the recorder. The tape spun fast backwards until he shut it off. When he heard the vampire\u0027s voice, he leaned forward, listening very carefully, then hit the button again for another place, and, hearing that, still another. But then at last his face brightened, as the reels turned and the voice spoke in an even modulated tone: \"It was a very warm evening, and I could tell as soon as I saw him on St. Charles that he had someplace to go... \u0027\"\\n\\n And quickly the boy noted:\\n\\n \"Lestat... off St. Charles Avenue. Old house crumbling... shabby neighborhood. Look for rusted railings.\"\\n\\n And then, stuffing the notebook quickly in his pocket, he gathered the tapes into his brief case, along with the small recorder, and hurried down the long hallway and down the stairs to the street, where in front of the corner bar his car was parked.\\n\\n THE END \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/interview-with-the-vampire-the-vampire-chronicles-1/page-33.html","bookId":2209,"book":{"id":2209,"title":"Interview with the Vampire (The Vampire Chronicles #1)","description":"Storyline: Interview With The Vampire (The Vampire Chronicles #1) \\n Here are the confessions of a vampire.
