Then his entire body moved forward as if being swept by a wind. One of them said he was about to say something when he fell. I thought that he was about to say something too, but it was at that moment I turned away from the window. My back was turned when I heard the noise.\" He glanced at the tape recorder. \"I could not forgive myself. I felt responsible for his death,\" he said. \"And everyone else seemed to think I was responsible also.\"\n \"But how could they? You said they saw him fall\"\n \"It wasn\u0027t a direct accusation. They simply knew that something had passed between us that was unpleasant. That we had argued minutes before the fall.\n \"The servants had heard us, my mother had heard us. My mother would not stop asking me what had happened and why my brother, who was so quiet, had been shouting. Then my sister joined in, and of course I refused to say. I was so bitterly shocked and miserable that I had no patience with anyone, only the vague determination they would not know about his\u0027visions.\u0027 They would not know that he had become, finally, not a saint, but only a... fanatic. My sister went to bed rather than face the funeral, and my mother told everyone in. the parish that something horrible had happened in my room which I would not reveal; and even the police questioned me, on the word of my own mother. Finally the priest came to see me and demanded to know what had gone on. I told no one. It was only a discussion, I said: I was not on the gallery when he fell, I protested, and they all stared at me as if rd killed him. And I felt that I\u0027d killed him. I sat in the parlor beside his coffin for two days thinking, I have killed him. I stared at his face until spots appeared before my eyes and I nearly fainted. The back of his skull had been shattered on the pavement, and his head had the wrong shape on the pillow. I forced myself to stare at it, to study it simply because I could hardly endure the pain and the smell (r)f decay, and I was tempted over and over to try to open his eyes. All these were mad thoughts, mad impulses. The main thought was this: I had laughed at him; I had not believed him; I had not been kind to him. He had fallen because of me.\"\n \"This really happened, didn\u0027t it?\" the boy whispered. \"You\u0027re telling me something...that\u0027s true.\"\n \"Yes,\" said the vampire, looking at him without surprise. \"I want to go on telling you.\" But as his eyes passed over the boy and returned to the window, he showed only faint interest in the boy, who seemed engaged in some silent inner struggle.\n \"But you said you didn\u0027t know about the visions, that you, a vampire... didn\u0027t know for certain whether...\n \"I want to take things in order,\" said the vampire, \"I want to go on telling you things as they happened.\n \"No, I don\u0027t know about the visions. To this day.\" And again he waited until the boy said.\n \"Yes, please, please go on.\"\n \"Well, I wanted to sell the plantations. I never wanted to see the house or the oratory again. I leased them finally to an agency which would work them for me and manage things so I need never go there, and I moved my mother and sister to one of the town houses in New Orleans. Of course, I did not escape my brother for a moment. I could think of nothing but his body rotting in the ground. He was buried in the St. Louis cemetery in New Orleans, and I did everything to avoid passing those gates; but still I thought of him constantly. . Drunk or sober, I saw his body rotting in the coin, and I couldn\u0027t bear it. Over and over I dreamed that he was at the head of the steps and I was holding his arm, talking kindly to him, urging him back into the bedroom, telling him gently that I did believe him, that he must pray for me to have faith. Meantime, the slaves on Pointe du Lac (that was my plantation) had begun to talk of seeing his ghost on the gallery, and the overseer couldn\u0027t keep order. People in society asked my sister offensive questions about the whole incident, and she became an hysteric. She wasn\u0027t really an hysteric. She simply thought she ought to react that way, so she did. I drank all the time and was at home as little as possible. I lived like a man who wanted to die but who had no courage to do it himself. I walked black streets and alleys alone; I passed out in cabarets. I backed out of two duels more from apathy than cowardice and truly wished to be murdered. And then I was attacked. It might have been anyone-and my invitation was open to sailors, thieves, maniacs, anyone. But it was a vampire. He caught me lust a few steps from my door one night and left me for dead, or so I thought.\"\n \"You mean... he sucked your, blood?\" the boy asked.\n \"Yes,\" the vampire laughed. \"He sucked my blood. That is the way it\u0027s done.\"\n \"But you lived,\" said the young man. \"You said he left you for dead.\"\n \"Well, he drained me almost to the point of death, which was for him sufficient. I was put to bed as soon as I was found, confused and really unaware of what had happened to me. I suppose I thought that drink had finally caused a stroke. I expected to die now and had no interest in eating of drinking or talking to the doctor. My mother sent for the priest. I was feverish by then and I told the priest everything, all about my brother\u0027s visions and what I had done. I remember I clung to his arm, making him swear over and over he would tell no one.\u0027I know I didn\u0027t kill him,\u0027 I said to the priest finally.\u0027It\u0027s that I cannot live now that he\u0027s dead. Not after the way I treated him.\u0027\n \" \u0027That\u0027s ridiculous,\u0027 he answered me.\u0027Of course you can live. There\u0027s nothing wrong with you but self-indulgence. Your mother needs you, not to mention your sister. And as for this brother of yours, he was possessed of the devil.\u0027 I was so stunned when he said this I couldn\u0027t protest. The devil made the visions, he went on to explain. The devil was rampant. The entire country of France was under the influence of the devil, and. the Revolution had been his greatest triumph. Nothing would have saved my brother but exorcism, prayer, and fasting, men to hold him down while the devil raged in his body and tried to throw him about.\u0027The devil threw him down the steps; it\u0027s perfectly obvious,\u0027 he declared.\u0027You weren\u0027t talking to your brother in that room, you were talking to the devil.\u0027 Well, this enraged me. I believed before that I had been pushed to my limits, but I had not. He went on talking about the devil, about voodoo amongst the slaves and cases of possession in other parts of the world. And I went wild. I wrecked the room in the process of nearly killing him.\"\n \"But your strength... the vampire... ?\" asked the boy.\n \"I was out of my mind,\" the vampire explained. \"I did things I could not have done in perfect health. The scene is confused, pale, fantastical now. But I do remember that I drove him out of the back doors of the house, across the courtyard, and against the brick wall of the kitchen, where I pounded his head until I nearly killed him. When I was subdued finally, and exhausted then almost to the point of death, they bled me. The fools. But I was going to say something else. It was then that I conceived of my own egotism. Perhaps I\u0027d seen it reflected in the priest. His contemptuous attitude towards my brother reflected my own; his immediate and shallow carping about the devil; his refusal to even entertain the idea that sanctity had passed so close.\"\n \"But he did believe in possession by the devil.\"\n \"That is a much more mundane idea,\" said the vampire immediately. \"People who cease to believe in God or goodness altogether still believe in the devil. I don\u0027t know why. No, I do indeed know why. Evil is always possible. And goodness is eternally difficult. But you must understand, possession is really another way of saying someone is mad. I felt it was, for the priest. I\u0027m sure he\u0027d seen madness. Perhaps he had stood right over raving madness and pronounced it possession. You don\u0027t have to see Satan when he is exorcised. But to stand in the presence of a saint... To believe that the saint has seen a vision. No, it\u0027s egotism, our refusal to believe it could occur in our midst.\"\n \"I never thought of it in that way,\" said the boy. \"But what happened to you? You said they bled you to cure you, and that must have nearly killed you.\"\n The vampire laughed. \"Yes. It certainly did. But the vampire came back that night. You see, he wanted Pointe du Lac, my plantation.\n \"It was very late, after my sister had fallen asleep. I can remember it as if it were yesterday. He came in from the courtyard, opening the French doors without a sound, a tall fair-skinned man with a mass of blond hair and a graceful, almost feline quality to his movements. And gently, he draped a shawl over my sister\u0027s eyes and lowered the wick of the lamp. She dozed there beside the basin and the cloth with which she\u0027d bathed my forehead, and she ,never once stirred under that shawl until morning. But by that time I was greatly changed.\"\n \"What was this change?\" asked the boy.\n The vampire sighed. He leaned back against the chair and looked at the walls. \"At first I thought he was another doctor, or someone summoned by the family to try to reason with me. But this suspicion was removed at once. He stepped close to my bed and leaned down so that his face was in the lamplight, and I saw that he was no ordinary man at all. His gray eyes burned with an incandescence, and the long white hands which hung by his sides were not those of a human being. I think I knew everything in that instant, and all that he told me was only aftermath. What I mean is, the moment I saw him, saw his extraordinary aura and knew him to be no creature I\u0027d ever known, I was reduced to nothing. That ego which could not accept the presence of an extraordinary human being in its midst was crushed. All my conceptions, even my guilt and wish to die, seemed utterly unimportant. I completely forgot myself!\" he said, now silently touching his breast with his fist. \"I forgot myself totally. And in the same instant knew totally the meaning of possibility. From then on I experienced only increasing wonder. As he talked to me and told me of what I might become, of what his life had been and stood to be, my past shrank to embers. I saw my life as if I stood apart from it, the vanity, the self-serving, the constant fleeing from one petty annoyance after another, the lip service to God and the Virgin and a host of saints whose names filled my prayer books, none of whom made the slightest difference in a narrow, materialistic, and selfish existence. I saw my real gods... the gods of most men. Food, drink, and security in conformity. Cinders.\"\n The boy\u0027s face was tense with a mixture of confusion and amazement. \"And so you decided to become a vampire?\" he asked. The vampire was silent for a moment.\n \"Decided. It doesn\u0027t seem the right word. Yet I cannot say it was inevitable from the moment that he stepped into that room. No, indeed, it was not inevitable. Yet I can\u0027t say I decided. Let me say that when he\u0027d finished speaking, no other decision was possible for me, and I pursued my course without a backward glance. Except for one.\"\n \"Except for one? What?\"\n \"My last sunrise,\" said the vampire. \"That morning, I was not yet a vampire. And I saw my last sunrise.\n \"I remember it completely; yet I do not think I remember any other sunrise before it. I remember the light came first to the tops of the French windows, a paling behind the lace curtains, and then a gleam growing brighter and brighter in patches among the leaves of the trees. Finally the sun came through the windows themselves and the lace lay in shadows on the stone floor, and all over the form of my sister, who was still sleeping, shadows of lace on the shawl over her shoulders and head. As soon as she was warm, she pushed the shawl away without awakening, and then the sun shone full on her eyes and she tightened her eyelids. Then it was gleaming on the table where she rested her head on her arms, and gleaming, blazing, in the water in the pitcher. And I could feel it on my hands on the counterpane and then on my face. I lay in the bed thinking about all the things the vampire had told me, and then it was that I said good-bye to the sunrise and went out to become a vampire. It was... the last sunrise.\"\n The vampire was looking out the window again. And when he stopped, the silence was so sudden the boy seemed to hear it. Then he could hear the noises from the street. The sound of a truck was deafening. The light cord stirred with the vibration. Then the truck was gone.\n \"Do you miss it?\" he asked then in a small voice.\n \"Not really,\" said the vampire. \"There are so many other things. But where were we? You want to know how it happened, how I became a vampire.\"\n \"Yes,\" said the boy. \"How did you change, exactly?\"\n \"I can\u0027t tell you exactly,\" said the vampire. \"I can tell you about it, enclose it with words that will make the value of it to me evident to you. But I can\u0027t tell you exactly, any more than I could tell you exactly what is the experience of sex if you have never had it.\"\n The young man seemed struck suddenly with still another question, but before he could speak the vampire went on. \"As I told you, this vampire Lestat, wanted the plantation. A mundane reason, surely, for granting me a life which will last until the end of the world; but he was not a very discriminating person. He didn\u0027t consider the world\u0027s small population of vampires as being a select club, I should say. He had human problems, a blind father who did not know his son was a vampire and must not find out. Living in New Orleans had become too difficult for him, considering his needs and the necessity to care for his father, and he wanted Pointe du Lac.\n \"We went at once to the plantation the next evening, ensconced the blind father in the master bedroom, and I proceeded to make the change. I cannot say that it consisted in any one step really-though one, of course, was the step beyond which I could make no return. But there were several acts involved, and the first was the death of the overseer. Lestat took him in his sleep. I was to watch and to approve; that is, to witness the taking of a human life as proof of my commitment and part of my change. This proved without doubt the most difficult part for me. I\u0027ve told you I had no fear regarding my own death, only a squeamishness about taking my life myself. But I had a most high regard for the life of others, and a horror of death most recently developed because of my brother. I had to watch the overseer awake with a start, try to throw oft Lestat with both hands, fail, then lie there struggling under Lestat\u0027s grasp, and finally go limp, drained of blood. And die. He did not die at once. We stood in his narrow bedroom for the better part of an hour watching him die. Part of my change, as I said. Lestat would never have stayed otherwise. Then it was necessary to get rid of the overseer\u0027s body. I was almost sick from this. Weak and feverish already, I had little reserve; and handling the dead body with such a purpose caused me nausea,. Lestat was laughing, telling me callously that I would feel so different once I was a vampire that I would laugh, too. He was wrong about that. I never laugh at death, no matter how often and regularly I am the cause of it.\n \"But let me take things in order. We had to drive up the river road until we came to open fields and leave the overseer there. We tore his coat, stole his money, and saw to it his- lips were stained with liquor. I knew his wife, who lived in New Orleans, and knew the state of desperation she would suffer when the body was discovered. But more than sorrow for her, I felt pain that she would never know what had happened, that her husband had not been found drunk on the road by robbers. As we beat the body, bruising the face and the shoulders, I became more and more aroused. Of course, you must realize that all this time the vampire Lestat was extraordinary. He was no more human to me than a biblical angel. But under this pressure, my enchantment with him was strained. I had seen my becoming a vampire in two lights: The first light was simply enchantment; Lestat had overwhelmed me on my deathbed. But the other light was my wish for self-destruction. My desire to be thoroughly damned. This was the open door through which Lestat had come on both the first and second occasion. Now I was not destroying myself but someone else. The overseer, his wife, his family. I recoiled and might have fled from Lestat, my sanity thoroughly shattered, had not he sensed with an infallible instinct what was happening. Infallible instinct....\" The vampire mused. \"Let me say the powerful instinct of a vampire to whom even the slightest change in a human\u0027s facial expression is as apparent as a gesture. Lestat had preternatural timing. He rushed me into the carriage and whipped the horses home.\u0027I want to die,\u0027 I began to murmur.\u0027This is unbearable. I want to die. You have it in your power to kill me. Let me die.\u0027 I refused to look at him, to be spellbound by the sheer beauty of his appearance. He spoke my name to me softly, laughing. As I said, he was determined to have the plantation.\"\n \"But would he have let you go?\" asked the boy. \"Under any circumstances?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. Knowing Lestat as I do now, I would say he would have killed me rather than let me go. But this was what I wanted, you see. It didn\u0027t matter. No, this was what I thought I wanted. As soon as we reached the house, I jumped down out of the carriage and walked, a zombie, to the brick stairs where my brother had fallen. The house had been unoccupied for months now, the overseer having his own cottage, and the Louisiana heat and damp were already picking apart the steps. Every crevice was sprouting grass and even small wildflowers. I remember feeling the moisture which in the night was cool as I sat down on the lower steps and even rested my head against the brick and felt the little wax-stemmed wildflowers with my hands. I pulled a clump of them out of ,the easy dirt in one hand.\u0027I want to die; kill me. Kill me,\u0027 I said to the vampire.\u0027Now I am guilty of murder. I can\u0027t live.\u0027 He sneered with the impatience of people listening to the obvious lies of others. And then in a flash he fastened on me just as he had on my man. I thrashed against him wildly. I dug my boot into his chest and kicked him as fiercely as I could, his teeth stinging my throat, the fever pounding in my temples. And with a movement of his entire body, much too fast for me to see, he was suddenly standing disdainfully at the foot of the steps.\u0027I thought you wanted to die, Louis,\u0027 he said.\"\n The boy made a soft, abrupt sound when the vampire said his name which the vampire acknowledged with the quick statement, \"Yes, that is my name,\" and went on.\n \"Well, I lay there helpless in the face of my own cowardice and fatuousness again,\" he said. \"Perhaps so directly confronted with it, I might in time have gained the courage to truly take my life, not to whine and beg for others to take it. I saw myself turning on a knife then, languishing in a day-to-day suffering which I found as necessary as penance from the confessional, truly hoping death would find me unawares and render me ft for eternal pardon. And also I saw myself as if in a vision standing at the head of the stairs, just where my brother had stood, and then hurtling my body down on the bricks.\n \"But there was no time for courage. Or shall I say, there was no time in Lestat\u0027s plan for anything but his plan.\u0027Now listen to me, Louis,\u0027 he said, and he lay down beside me now on the steps, his movement so graceful and so personal that at once it made me think\n of a lover. I recoiled. But he put his right arm around me and pulled me close to his chest. Never had I been this close to him before, and in the dim light I could see the magnificent radiance of his eye and the unnatural mask of his skin. As I tried to move, he ,pressed his right fingers against my lips and said, Be still. I am going to drain you now to the very threshold of death, and I want you to be quiet, so quiet that you can almost hear the flow of blood through your veins, so quiet that you can hear the flow of that same blood through mine. It is your consciousness, your will, which must keep you alive.\u0027 I wanted to struggle, but he pressed so hard with his fingers that he held my entire prone body in check; and as soon as I stopped my abortive attempt at rebellion, he sank his teeth into my neck.\"\n The boy\u0027s eyes grew huge. He had drawn farther and farther back in his chair as the vampire spoke, and now his face was tense, his eyes narrow, as if he were preparing to weather a blow.\n \"Have you ever lost a great amount of blood?\" asked the vampire. \"Do you know the feeling?\"\n The boy\u0027s lips shaped the word no, but no sound came out. He cleared his throat. \"No,\" he said.\n \"Candles burned in the upstairs parlor, where we had planned the death of the overseer. An oil lantern swayed in the breeze on the gallery. All of this light coalesced and began to shimmer, as though a golden presence hovered above me, suspended in the stairwell, softly entangled with the railings, curling and contracting like smoke.\u0027Listen, keep your eyes wide,\u0027 Lestat whispered to me, his lips moving against my neck. I remember that the movement of his lips raised the hair all over my body, sent a shock of sensation through my body that was not unlike the pleasure of passion.... \"\n He mused, his right fingers slightly curled beneath his chin, the first finger appearing to lightly stroke it. \"The result was that within minutes I was weak to paralysis. Panic-stricken, I discovered I could not even will myself to speak. Lestat still held me, of course, and his arm was like the weight of an iron bar. I felt his teeth withdraw with such a keenness that the two puncture wounds seemed enormous, lined with pain. And now he bent over my helpless head and, taking his right hand off me, bit his own wrist. The blood flowed down upon my shirt and coat, and he watched it with a narrow, gleaming eye. It seemed an eternity that he watched it, and that shimmer of light now hung behind his head like the backdrop of an apparition. I think that I knew what he meant to do even before he did it, and I was waiting in my helplessness as if I\u0027d been waiting for years. He pressed his bleeding wrist to my mouth, said firmly, a little impatiently,\u0027Louis, drink.\u0027 And I did.\u0027Steady, Louis,\u0027 and\u0027Hurry,\u0027 he whispered to me a number of times. I drank, sucking the blood out of the holes, experiencing for the first time since infancy the special pleasure of sucking nourishment, the body focused with the mind upon one vital source. Then something happened.\" The vampire sat back, a slight frown on his face.\n \"How pathetic it is to describe these things which can\u0027t truly be described,\" he said, his voice loci almost to a whisper. The boy sat as if frozen. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/interview-with-the-vampire-the-vampire-chronicles-1/page-2.html","bookId":2209,"book":{"id":2209,"title":"Interview with the Vampire (The Vampire Chronicles #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Interview With The Vampire (The Vampire Chronicles #1) \n Here are the confessions of a vampire.
