I tried to stare at the limits of the light, to see each new bark as it loomed before us. Something did move, and I reached for Claudia, almost pulling her sharply near to me. But it was only a reptile, shooting through the leaves with a whip of his tail. The leaves settled. But Claudia moved back against me, under the folds of my cape, a hand firmly clasping the cloth of my coat; and she seemed to propel me forward, my cape falling over the loose fabric of her own. \"Soon the scent of the water was gone, and when the moon shone clear for an instant I could see right ahead of us what appeared to be a break in the woods. Claudia firmly clasped the lantern and shut its metal door. I moved to stop this, my hand struggling with hers; but then she said to me quietly,\u0027Close your eyes for an instant, and then open them slowly. And when you do, you will see it.\u0027 \"A chill rose over me as I did this, during which I held fast to her-shoulder. But then I opened my eyes and saw beyond the distant bark of the trees the long, low walls of the monastery and the high square top of the massive tower. Far beyond it, above an immense black valley, gleamed the snow-capped peaks of the mountains. \u0027Come,\u0027 she said to me,\u0027quiet, as if your body has no weight.\u0027 And she started without hesitation right towards those walls, right towards whatever might have been waiting in their shelter. \"In moments we had found the gap that would admit us, the great opening that was blacker still than the walls around it, the vines encrusting its edges as if to hold the stones in place. High above, through the open room, the damp smell of the stones strong in my nostrils, I saw, beyond the streaks of clouds, a faint sprinkling of stars. A great staircase moved upward, from corner to corner, all the way to the narrow windows that looked out upon the valley. And beneath the first rise of the stair, out of the gloom emerged the vast, dark opening to the monastery\u0027s remaining rooms. \"Claudia was still now, as if she had become the stones. In the damp enclosure not even the soft tendrils of her hair moved. She was listening. And then I was listening with her. There was only the low backdrop of the wind. She moved, slowly, deliberately, and with one pointed foot gradually cleared a space in the moist earth in front of her. I could see a flat stone there, and it sounded hollow as she gently tapped it with her heel. Then I could see the broad size of it and how it rose at one distant corner; and an image came to mind, dreadful in its sharpness, of that band of men and women from the village surrounding the stone, raising it with a giant lever. Claudia\u0027s eyes moved over the staircase and then fixed on the crumbling doorway beneath it. The moon shone for an instant through a lofty window. Then Claudia moved, so suddenly that she stood beside me without having made a sound.\u0027Do you hear it?\u0027 she whispered.\u0027Listen.\u0027 \"It was so low no mortal could have heard it. And it did not come from the ruins. It came from far off, not the long, meandering way that we had come up the slope, but another way, up the spine of the hill, directly from the village. Just a rustling now, a scraping, but it was steady; and then slowly the round tramping of a foot began to distinguish itself. Claudia\u0027s hand tightened on mine, and with a gentle pressure she moved me silently beneath the slope of the stairway. I could see the folds of her dress heave slightly beneath the edge of her cape. The tramp of the feet grew louder, and I began to sense that one step preceded the other very sharply, the second dragging slowly across the earth. It was a limping step, drawing nearer and nearer over the low whistling of the wind. My own heart beat hard against my chest, and I felt the veins in my temples tighten, a tremor passing through my limbs, so that I could feel the fabric of my shirt against me, the stiff cut of the collar, the very scraping of the buttons against my cape. \"Then a faint scent came with the wind. It was the scent of blood, at once arousing me, against my will, the warm, sweet scent of human blood, blood that was spilling, flowing and then I sensed the smell of living flesh and I heard in time with the feet a dry, hoarse breathing. But with it came another sound, faint and intermingled with the first, as the feet tramped closer and closer to the walls, the sound of yet another creature\u0027s halting, strained breath. And I could hear the heart of that creature, beating irregularly, a fearful throbbing; but beneath that was another heart, a steady, pulsing heart growing louder and louder, a heart as strong as my own? Then, in the jagged gap through which we\u0027d come, I saw him. `His great, huge shoulder emerged first and one long, loose arm and hand, the fingers curved; then I saw his head. Over his other shoulder he was carrying a body. In the broken doorway he straightened and shifted the weight and stared directly into the darkness towards us. Every muscle in me became iron as I looked at him, saw the outline of his head looming there against the sky. But nothing of his face was visible except the barest glint of the moon on his eye as if it were a fragment of glass. Then I saw it glint on his buttons and heard them rustle as his arm swung free again and one long leg bent as he moved forward and proceeded into the tower right towards us. \"I held fast to Claudia, ready in an instant to shove her behind me, to step forward to meet him. But then I saw with astonishment that his eyes did not see me as I saw him, and he was trudging under the weight of the body he carried towards the monastery door. The moon fell now on his bowed head, on a mass of wavy black hair that touched his bent shoulder, and on the full black sleeve of his coat. I saw something about his coat; the flap of it was badly torn and the sleeve appeared to be ripped from the seam. I almost fancied I could see his flesh through the shoulder. The human in his arms stirred now, and moaned miserably. And the figure stopped for a moment and appeared to stroke the human with his hand. And at that moment I stepped forward from the wall and went towards him. \"No words passed my lips: I knew none to say. I only knew that I moved into the light of the moon before him and that his dark, wavy head rose with a jerk, and that I saw his eyes. \"For one full instant he looked at me, and I saw the light shining in those eyes and then glinting on two sharp canine teeth; and then a low strangled cry seemed to rise from the depths of his throat which, for a second, I thought to be my own. The human crashed to the stones, a shuddering moan escaping his lips. And the vampire lunged at me, that strangled cry rising again as the stench of fetid breath rose in my nostrils and the clawlike fingers cut into the very fur of my cape. I fell backwards, my head cracking against the wall, my hands grabbing at his head, clutching a mass of tangled filth that was his hair. At once the wet, rotting fabric of his coat ripped in my grasp, but the arm that held me was like iron; and, as I struggled to pull the head backwards, the fangs touched the flesh of my throat. Claudia screamed behind him. Something hit his head hard, which stopped him suddenly; and then he was hit again. He turned as if to strike her a blow, and I sent my fist against his face as powerfully as I could. Again a stone struck him as she darted away, and I threw my full weight against him and felt his crippled leg buckling. I remember pounding his head over and over, my fingers all but pulling that filthy hair out by the roots, his fangs projected towards me, his hands scratching, clawing at me. We rolled over and over, until I pinned him down again and the moon shone full on his face. And I realized, through my frantic sobbing breaths, what it was I held in my arms. The two huge eyes bulged from naked sockets and two small, hideous holes made up his nose; only a putrid, leathery flesh enclosed his skull, and the rank, rotting rags that covered his frame were thick with earth and slime and blood. I was battling a mindless, animated corpse. But no more. \"From above him, a sharp stone fell full on his forehead, and a fount of blood gushed from between his eyes. He struggled, but another stone crashed with such force I heard the bones shatter. Blood seeped out beneath the matted hair, soaking into the stones and grass. The chest throbbed beneath me, but the arms shuddered and grew still. I drew up, my throat knotted, my heart burning, every fiber of my body aching from the struggle. For a moment the great tower seemed to tilt, but then it righted itself. I lay against the wall, staring at the thing, the blood rushing in my ears. Gradually I realized that Claudia knelt on his chest, that she was probing the mass of hair and bone that had been his head. She was scattering the fragments of his skull. We had met the European vampire, the creature of the Old World. He was dead\" \"For a long time I lay on the broad stairway, oblivious to the thick earth that covered it, my head feeling very cool against the earth, just looking at him. Claudia stood at his feet, hands hanging limply at her sides. I saw her eyes close for an instant, two tiny lids that made her face like a small, moonlit white statue as she stood there. And then her body began to rock very slowly. \u0027Claudia,\u0027 I called to her. She awakened. She was gaunt such as I had seldom seen her. She pointed to the human who lay far across the floor of the tower near the wall. He was still motionless, but I knew that he was not dead. I\u0027d forgotten him completely, my body aching as it was, my senses still clouded with the stench of the bleeding corpse. But now I saw the man. And in some part of my mind I knew what his fate would be, and I cared nothing for it. I knew it was only an hour at most before dawn. \"\u0027He\u0027s moving,\u0027 she said to me. And I tried to rise off the steps. Better that he not wake, better that he never wake at all, I wanted to say; she was walking towards him, passing indifferently the dead thing that had nearly killed us both. I saw her back and the man stirring in front of her, his foot twisting in the grass. I don\u0027t know what I expected to see as I drew nearer, what terrified peasant or farmer, what miserable wretch that had already seen the face of that thing that had brought it here. And for a moment I did not realize who it was that lay there, that it was Morgan, whose pale face showed now in the moon, the marks of the vampire on his throat, his blue eyes staring mute and expressionless before him. \"Suddenly they widened as I drew close to him.\u0027Louis!\u0027 he whispered in astonishment, his lips moving as if he were trying to frame words but could not.\u0027Louis... \u0027 he said again; and then I saw he was smiling. A dry, rasping sound came from him as he struggled to his knees, and he reached out for me. His blanched, contorted face strained as the sound died in his throat, and he nodded desperately, his red hair loose and disheveled, falling into his eyes. I turned and ran from him. Claudia shot past me, gripping me by the arm.\u0027Do you see the color of the sky!\u0027 she hissed at me. Morgan fell forward on his hands behind her.\u0027Louis,\u0027 he called out again, the light gleaming in his eyes. He seemed blind to the ruins, blind to the night, blind to everything but a face he recognized, that one word again issuing from his lips. I put my hands to my ears, backing away from him. His hand was bloody now as he lifted it. I could smell the blood as well as see it. And Claudia could smell it, too. \"Swiftly she descended on him, pushing him down against the stones, her white fingers moving through his red hair. He tried to raise his head. His outstretched hands made a frame about her face, and then suddenly he began to stroke her yellow curls. She sank her teeth, and the hands dropped helpless at his side. \"I was at the edge of the forest when she caught up with me.\u0027You must go to him, take him,\u0027 she commanded. I could smell the blood on her lips, see the warmth in her cheeks. Her wrist burned against me, yet I did not move.\u0027Listen to me, Louis,\u0027 she said, her voice at once desperate and angry.\u0027I left him for you, but he\u0027s dying... there\u0027s no time.\u0027 \"I swung her up into my arms and started the long descent. No need for caution, no need for stealth, no preternatural host waiting. The door to the secrets of eastern Europe was shut against us. I was plowing through the dark to the road.\u0027Will you listen to me,\u0027 she cried out. But I went on in spite of her, her hands clutching at my coat, my hair.\u0027Do you see the sky; do you see it!\u0027 she railed. \"She was all but sobbing against my breast as I splashed through the icy stream and ran headlong in search of the lantern at the road. \"The sky was a dark blue when I found the carriage. :Give me the crucifix,\u0027 I shouted to Claudia as I cracked the whip.\u0027There\u0027s only one place to go.\u0027 She was thrown against me as the carriage rocked into its turn and headed for the village. \"I had the eeriest feeling then as I could see the mist rising amongst the dark brown trees. The air was cold and fresh and the birds had begun. It was as if the sun were rising. Yet I did not care. And yet I knew that it was not rising, that there was still time. It was a marvelous, quieting feeling. The scrapes and cuts burned my flesh and my heart ached with hunger, but my head felt marvelously light. Until I saw the gray shapes of the inn and the steeple of the church; they were too clear. And the stars above were fading fast. \"In a moment I was hammering on the door of the inn. As it opened, I put my hood up around my face tightly and held Claudia beneath my cape in a bundle.\u0027Your village is rid of the vampire!\u0027 I said to the woman, who stared at me in astonishment. I was clutching the crucifix which she\u0027d given me.\u0027Thanks be to God he\u0027s dead. You\u0027ll find the remains in the tower. Tell this to your people at once.\u0027 I pushed past her into the inn. \"The gathering was roused into commotion instantly, but I insisted that I was tired beyond endurance. I must pray and rest. They were-to get my chest from the carriage and bring it to a decent room where I might sleep. But a message was to come for me from the bishop at Varna and for this, and this only, was I to be awakened.\u0027Tell the good father when he arrives that the vampire is dead, and then give him food and drink and have him wait for me,\u0027 I said. The woman was crossing herself.\u0027You understand,\u0027 I said to her, as I hurried towards the stairs,\u0027I couldn\u0027t reveal my mission to you until after the vampire had been.... `Yes, yes,\u0027 she said to me.\u0027But you are not a priest... the child!\u0027\u0027No, only too well-versed in these matters. The Unholy One is no match for me,\u0027 I said to her. I stopped. The door of the little parlor stood open, with nothing but a white square of cloth on the oak table.\u0027Your friend,\u0027 she said to me, and she looked at the floor.\u0027He rushed out into the night... he was mad.\u0027 I only nodded. \"I could hear them shouting when I shut the door of the room. They seemed to be running in all directions; and then came the sharp sound of the church bell in the rapid peal of alarm. Claudia had slipped down from my arms, and she was staring at me gravely as I bolted the door. Very slowly I unlatched the shutter of the window. An icy light seeped into the room. Still she watched me. Then I felt her at my side. I looked down to see she was holding out her hand to me.\u0027Here,\u0027 she said. She must have seen I was confused. I felt so weak that her face was shimmering as I looked at it, the blue of her eyes dancing on her white cheeks. \"\u0027Drink,\u0027 she whispered, drawing nearer.\u0027Drink.\u0027 And she held the soft, tender flesh of the wrist towards me. \u0027No, I know what to do; haven\u0027t I done it in the past?\u0027 I said to her. It was she who bolted the window tight, latched the heavy door. I remember kneeling by the small grate and feeling the ancient paneling. It was rotten behind the varnished surface, and it gave under my fingers. Suddenly I saw my fist go through it and felt the sharp jab of splinter in my wrist. And then I remember feeling in the dark and catching hold of something warm and pulsing. A rush of cold, damp air hit my face and I saw a darkness rising about me, cool and damp as if this air were a silent water that seeped through the broken wall and filled the room. The room was gone. I was drinking from a never-ending stream of warm blood that flowed down my throat and through my pulsing heart and through my veins, so that my skin warmed against this cool, dark water. And now the pulse of the blood I drank slackened, and all my body cried out for it not to slacken, my heart pounding, trying to make that heart pound with it. I felt myself rising, as if I were floating in the darkness, and then the darkness, like the heartbeat, began to fade.. Something glimmered in my swoon; it shivered ever so slightly with the pounding of feet on the stairs, on the floorboards, the rolling of wheels and horses\u0027 hooves on the earth, and it gave off a tinkling sound as it shivered. It had a small wooden frame around it, and in that frame there emerged, through the glimmer, the figure of a man. He was familiar. I knew his long, slender build, his black, wavy hair. Then I saw that his green eyes were gazing at me. And in his teeth, in his teeth, he was clutching something huge and soft and brown, which he pressed tightly with both his hands. It was a rat. A great loathsome brown rat he held, its feet poised, its mouth agape, its great curved tail frozen in the air. Crying out, he threw it down and stared aghast, blood flowing from his open mouth. \"A searing light hit my eyes. I struggled to open them against it, and the entire room was glowing. Claudia was right in front of me. She was not a tiny child, but someone much larger who drew me forward towards her with both hands. She was on her knees, and my arms encircled her waist. Then darkness descended, and I had her folded against me. The lock slid into place. Numbness carne over my limbs, and then the paralysis of oblivion.\" And that was how it was throughout Transylvania and Hungary and Bulgaria, and through all those countries where the peasants know that the living dead walk, and the legends of the vampires abound. In every village where we did encounter the vampire, it was the same.\" \"A mindless corpse?\" the boy asked. \"Always,\" said the vampire. \"When we found these creatures at all. I remember a handful at most. Sometimes we only watched them from a distance, all too familiar with their wagging, bovine heads, their haggard shoulders, their rotted, ragged clothing. In one hamlet it was a woman, only dead for perhaps a few months; the villagers had glimpsed her and knew her by name. It was she who gave us the only hope we were to experience after the monster in Transylvania, and that hope came to nothing. She fled from us through the forest and we ran after her, reaching out for her long, black hair. Her white burial gown was soaked with dried blood, her fingers caked with the dirt of the grave. And her eyes... they were mindless, two pools that reflected the moon. No secrets, no truths, only despair.\" \"But what were these creatures? Why were they like this?\" asked the boy, his lips grimacing with disgust. \"I don\u0027t understand. How could they be so different from you and Claudia, yet exist?\" \"I had my theories. So did Claudia. But the main thing which I had then was despair. And in despair the recurring fear that we had killed the only other vampire like us, Lestat. Yet it seemed unthinkable. Had he possessed the wisdom of a sorcerer, the powers of a. witch... I might have come to understand that he had somehow managed to wrest a conscious life from the same forces that governed these monsters. But he was only Lestat, as I\u0027ve described him to you: devoid of mystery, finally, his limits as familiar to me in those months in eastern Europe as. his charms. I wanted to forget -him, and yet it seemed I thought of him always. It was as if the empty nights were made for thinking of him. And sometimes I found myself so vividly aware of him it was as if he had only just left the room and the ring of his voice were still there. And somehow there was a disturbing comfort in that, and, despite myself, I\u0027d envision his face-not as it had been the last night in the fire, but on other nights, that last evening he spent with us at home, his hand playing idly with the keys of the spinet, his head tilted to one side. A sickness rose in me more wretched than anguish when I saw what my dreams were doing. I wanted him alive! In the dark nights of eastern Europe, Lestat was the only vampire I\u0027d found. \"But Claudia\u0027s waking thoughts were of afar more practical nature. Over and over, she had me recount that night in the hotel in New Orleans when she\u0027d become a vampire, and over and over she searched the process for some clue to why these things we met in the country graveyards had no mind. What if, after Lestat\u0027s infusion of blood, she\u0027d been put in a grave, closed up in it until the preternatural drive for blood caused her to break the stone door of the vault that held her, what then would her mind have been, starved, as it were, to the breaking point? Her body might have saved itself when no mind remained. And through the world she would have blundered, ravaging where she could, as we saw these creatures do. That was how she explained them. But what had fathered them, how had they begun? That was what she couldn\u0027t explain and what gave her hope of discovery when I, from sheer exhaustion, had none.\u0027They spawn their own kind, it\u0027s obvious, but where does it begin?\u0027 she asked. And then, somewhere near the outskirts of Vienna, she put the question to me which had never before passed her lips. Why could I not do what Lestat had done with both of us? Why could I not make another vampire? I don\u0027t know why at first I didn\u0027t even understand her, except that in loathing what I was with every impulse in me I had a particular fear of that question, which was almost worse than any other. You see, I didn\u0027t understand something strong in myself. Loneliness had caused me to think on that very possibility years before, when I had fallen under the spell of Babette Freniere. But I held it locked inside of me like an unclean passion. I shunned mortal life after her. I killed strangers. And the Englishman Morgan, because I knew him, was as safe from my fatal embrace as Babette had been. They both caused me too much pain. Death I couldn\u0027t think of giving them. Life in death-it was monstrous. I turned away from Claudia. I wouldn\u0027t answer her. But angry as she was, wretched as was her impatience, she could not stand this turning away. And she drew near to me, comforting me with her hands and her eyes as if she were my loving daughter. \"\u0027Don\u0027t think on it, Louis,\u0027 she said later, when we were comfortably situated in a small suburban hotel. I was standing at the window, looking at the distant glow of Vienna, so eager for that city, its civilization, its sheer size. The night was clear and the haze of the city was on the sky.\u0027Let me put your conscience at ease, though I\u0027ll never know precisely what it is,\u0027 she said into my ear, her hand stroking my hair. \"\u0027Do that, Claudia,\u0027 I answered her.\u0027Put it at ease. Tell me that you\u0027ll never speak to me of making vampires again.\u0027 \"\u0027I want no orphans such as ourselves!\u0027 she said, all too quickly. My words annoyed her. My feeling annoyed her.\u0027I want answers, knowledge, she said. But tell me, Louis, what makes you so certain that you\u0027ve never done this without your knowing it?\u0027 \"Again there was that deliberate obtuseness in me. I must look at her as if I didn\u0027t know the meaning of her words. I wanted her to be silent and to be near me, and for us to be in Vienna. I drew her hair back and let my fingertips touch her long lashes and looked away at the light. \"\u0027After all, what does it take to make those creatures?\u0027 she went on.\u0027Those vagabond monsters? How many drops of your blood intermingled with a man\u0027s blood... and what kind of heart to survive that first attack?\u0027 \"I could feel her watching my face, and I stood there, my arms folded, my back to the side of the window, looking out. \"\u0027That pale-faced Emily, that miserable Englishman... \u0027 she said, oblivious to the flicker of pain in my face.\u0027Their hearts were nothing, and it was the fear of death as much as the drawing of blood that killed them. The idea killed them. But what of the hearts that survive? Are you sure you haven\u0027t fathered a league of monsters who, from time to time, struggled vainly and instinctively to follow in your footsteps? What was their life span; these orphans you left behind you-a day there, a week here, before the sun burnt them to ashes or some mortal victim cut them down?\u0027 \"\u0027Stop it,\u0027 I begged her. \u0027If you knew how completely I envision everything you describe, you would not describe it. I tell you it\u0027s never happened! Lestat drained me to the point of death to make me a vampire. And gave back all that blood mingled with his own. That is how it was done!\u0027 \"She looked away from me, and then it seemed she was looking down at her hands. I think I heard her sigh, but I wasn\u0027t certain. And then her eyes moved over me, slowly, up and down, before they finally met mine. Then it seemed she smiled.\u0027Don\u0027t be frightened of my fancy,\u0027 she said softly.\u0027After all, the final decision will always rest with you. Is that not so?\u0027 \"\u0027I don\u0027t understand,\u0027 I said. And a cold laughter erupted from her as she turned away. \"\u0027Can you picture it?\u0027 she said, so softly I scarcely heard. BA coven of children? That is all I could provide. . \u0027 \"\u0027Claudia,\u0027 I murmured. \"\u0027Rest easy,\u0027 she said abruptly, her voice still low.\u0027I tell you that as much as I hated Lestat... \u0027 She stopped. \"\u0027Yes... \u0027 I whispered.\u0027Yes.... \u0027 \" \u0027As much as I hated him, with him we were... complete.\u0027 She looked at me, her eyelids quivering, as if the slight rise in her voice had disturbed her even as it had disturbed me. \"\u0027No, only you were complete... \u0027 I said to her.\u0027Because there were two of us, one on either side of you, from the beginning.\u0027 \"I thought I saw her smile then, but I was not certain. She bowed her head, but I could see her eyes moving beneath the lashes, back and forth, back and forth. Then she said,\u0027The two of you at my side. Do you picture that as you say it, as you picture everything else?\u0027 \"One night, long gone by, was as material to me as if I were in it still, but I didn\u0027t tell her. She was desperate in that night, running away from Lestat, who had urged her to kill a woman in the street from whom she\u0027d backed off, clearly alarmed. I was sure the woman had resembled her mother. Finally she\u0027d escaped us entirely, but I\u0027d found her in the armoire, beneath the jackets and coats, clinging to her doll. And, carrying her to her crib, I sat beside her and sang to her, and she stared at me as she clung to that doll, as if trying blindly and mysteriously to calm a pain she herself did not begin to understand. Can you picture it, this splendid domesticity, dim lamps, the vampire father singing to the vampire daughter? Only the doll had a human face, only the doll. \"\u0027But we must get away from here!\u0027 said the present Claudia suddenly, as though the thought had just taken shape in her mind with a special urgency. She had her hand to her ear, as if clutching it against some awful sound.\u0027From the roads behind us, from what I see in your eyes now, because I give voice to thoughts which are nothing more to me than plain considerations... \u0027 \"\u0027Forgive me,\u0027 I said as gently as I could, withdrawing slowly from that long-ago room, that ruffled crib, that frightened monster child and monster voice. And Lestat, where was Lestat? A match striking in the other room, a shadow leaping suddenly into life, as light and dark come alive where there was only darkness. \"\u0027No, you forgive me... \u0027 she was saying to me now, in this little hotel room near the first capital of western Europe.\u0027No, we forgive each other. But we don\u0027t forgive him; and, without him, you see what things are between us: \"\u0027Only now because we are tired, and things are dreary... \u0027 I said to her and to myself, because there was no one else in the world to whom I could speak. \"\u0027Ah, yes; and that is what must end. I tell you, I begin to understand that we have done it all wrong from the start. We must bypass Vienna. We need our language, our people. I want to go directly now to Paris.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/interview-with-the-vampire-the-vampire-chronicles-1/page-18.html","bookId":2209,"book":{"id":2209,"title":"Interview with the Vampire (The Vampire Chronicles #1)","description":"Storyline: Interview With The Vampire (The Vampire Chronicles #1) Here are the confessions of a vampire.
