{"id":102097,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"\"I didn\u0027t do this. I fined my eyes firmly on one of those small paintings above his desk until it ceased to be the Madonna and Child and became a harmony of line and color. Because I knew what he was saying to me was true.\n \"\u0027Stop them if you will, advise them that we don\u0027t mean any harm. Why can\u0027t you do this? You say yourself we\u0027re not your enemies, no matter what we\u0027ve done.... \u0027\n \"I could hear him sigh, faintly.\u0027I have stopped them for the time being,\u0027 he said.\u0027But I don\u0027t want such power over them as would be necessary to stop them entirely. Because if I exercise such power, then I must protect it. I will make enemies. And I would have forever to deal with my enemies when all I want here as a certain space, a certain peace. Or not to be here at all. I accept the scepter of sorts they\u0027ve given me, but not to rule over them, only to keep them at a distance.\u0027\n \"\u0027I should have known,\u0027 I said, my eyes still fired on that painting.\n \"\u0027Then, you must stay away. Celeste has a great deal of power, being one of the oldest, and she is jealous of the child\u0027s beauty. And Santiago, as you can see, is only waiting for a shred of proof that you\u0027re outlaws.\u0027\n \"I turned slowly and looked at him again where he sat with that eerie vampire stillness, as if he were in fact not alive at all. The moment lengthened. I heard his words just as if he were speaking them again:\u0027All I want here is a certain space, a certain peace. (r)r not to be here at all.\u0027 And I felt a longing for him so strong that it took all my strength to contain it, merely to sit there gazing at him, fighting it. I wanted it to be this way: Claudia safe amongst these vampires somehow, guilty of no crime they might ever discover from her or anyone else, so that I might be free, free to remain forever in this cell as long as I could be welcome, even tolerated, allowed here on any condition whatsoever.\n \"I could see that mortal boy again as if he were not asleep on the bed but kneeling at Armand\u0027s side with his arms around Armand\u0027s neck. It was an icon for me of love. The love I felt. Not physical love, you must understand. I don\u0027t speak of that at all, though Armand was beautiful and simple, and no intimacy with him would ever have been repellent. For vampires, physical love culminates and is satisfied in one thing, the kill. I speak of another kind of love which drew me to him completely as the teacher which Lestat had never been. Knowledge would never be withheld by Armand, I knew it. I would pass through him as through a pane of glass so that I might bask in it and absorb it and grow. I shut my eyes. And I thought I heard him speak, so faintly I wasn\u0027t certain. It seemed he said,\u0027Bo you know why I am here?\u0027\n \"I looked up at him again, wondering if he knew my thoughts, could actually read them, if such could conceivably be the extent of that power. Now after all these years I could forgive Lestat for being nothing but an ordinary creature who could riot show me the uses of my powers; and yet I still longed for this, could fall into it without resistance. A sadness pervaded it all, sadness for my own weakness and my own awful dilemma. Claudia waited for me. Claudia, who was my daughter and my love.\n \"\u0027What am I to do?\u0027 I whispered.\u0027Go away from them, go away from you? After all these years...\n \"\u0027They don\u0027t matter to you,\u0027 he said\n \"I smiled and nodded.\n \"\u0027What is it you want to do?\u0027 he asked. And his voice assumed the most gentle, sympathetic tone.\n \"\u0027Don\u0027t you know, don\u0027t you have that power?\u0027 I asked.\u0027Can\u0027t you read my thoughts as if they were words?\u0027\n \"He shook his head.\u0027Not the way you mean. I only know the danger to you and the child is real because it\u0027s real to you. And I know your loneliness even with her love is almost more terrible than you can bear.\u0027\n \"I stood up then. It would seem a simple thing to do, to rise, to go to the door, to hurry quickly down that passage; and yet it took every ounce of strength, every smattering of that curious thing I\u0027ve called my detachment.\n \"\u0027I ask you to keep them away from us,\u0027 I said at the door; but I couldn\u0027t look back at him, didn\u0027t even want the soft intrusion of his voice.\n \"\u0027Don\u0027t go,\u0027 he said.\n \"\u0027I have no choice.\u0027\n \"I was in the passage when I heard him so close to me that I started. He stood beside me, eye level with my eye, and in his hand he held a key which he pressed into mine.\n \"\u0027There is a door there,\u0027 he said, gesturing to the dark end, which I\u0027d thought to be merely a wall.\u0027And a stairs to the side street which no one uses but myself. Go this way now, so you can avoid the others. You are anxious and they will see it\u0027 I turned around to go at once, though every part of my being wanted to remain there. \u0027But let me tell you this,\u0027 he said, and lightly he pressed the back of his hand against my heart.\u0027Use the power inside you. Don\u0027t abhor it anymore. Use that power! And when they see you in the streets above, use that power to make your face a mask and think as you gaze on them as on anyone: beware. Take that word as if it were an amulet rd given you to wear about your neck. And when your eyes meet Santiago\u0027s eyes, or the eyes of any other vampire, speak to them politely what you will, but think of that word and that word only. Remember what I say. I speak to you simply because you respect what is simple. You understand this. That\u0027s your strength.\u0027\n \"I took the key from him, and I don\u0027t remember actually putting it into the lock or going up the steps. Or where he was or what he\u0027d done. Except that, as I was stepping into the dark side street behind the theater, I heard ham say very softly to me from someplace close to me:\u0027Come here, to me, when you can.\u0027 I looked around for him but was not surprised that I couldn\u0027t see him. He had told me also sometime or other that I must not leave the Hotel Saint-Gabriel, that I must not give the others the shred of evidence of guilt they wanted.\u0027You see,\u0027 he said,\u0027killing other vampires is very exciting; that is why it is forbidden under penalty of death.\u0027\n \"And . then I seemed to awake. To the Paris street sharing with rain, to the tall, narrow buildings on either side of me, to the fact that the door had shut to make a solid dark wall behind me and that Armand was no longer there.\n \"And though I knew Claudia waited for me, though I passed her in the hotel window above the gas lamps, a tiny figure standing among waxen petaled flowers, I moved away from the boulevard, letting the darker streets swallow me, as so often the streets of New Orleans had done.\n \"It was not that I did not love her; rather, it was that I knew I loved her only too well, that the passion for her was as great as the passion for Armand. And I fled them both now, letting the desire for the kill rise in me like a welcome fever, threatening consciousness, threatening pain.\n \"Out of the mist which had followed the rain, a man was walking towards me. I can remember him as roaming on the landscape of a dream, because the night around me was dark and unreal. The hill might have been anywhere in the world, and the soft lights of Paris were an amorphous shimmering in the fog. And sharp-eyed and drunk, he was walking blindly into the arms of death itself, his pulsing fingers reaching out to touch the very bones of my face.\n \"I was not crazed yet, not desperate. I might have said to him,\u0027Pass by.\u0027 I believe my lips did form the word Armand had given me,\u0027Beware.\u0027 Yet I let him slip his bold, drunken arm around my waist; I yielded to his adoring eyes, to the voice that begged to paint me now and spoke of warmth, to the rich, sweet smell of the oils that streaked his loose shirt. I was following him, through Montmartre, and I whispered to him,\u0027You are not a member of the dead.\u0027 He was leading me through an overgrown garden, through the sweet, wet grasses, and he was laughing as I said,\u0027Alive, alive,\u0027 his hand touching my cheek, stroking my face, clasping finally my chin as he guided me into the light of the low doorway, his reddened face brilliantly illuminated by the oil lamps, the warmth seeping about. us as the door closed.\n \"I saw the great sparkling orbs of his eyes, the tiny red veins that reached for the dark centers, that warm hand burning my cold hunger as he guided me to a chair. And then all around me I saw faces blazing, faces rising in the smoke of the lamps, in the shimmer of the burning stove, a wonderland of colors on canvases surrounding us beneath the small, sloped roof, a blaze of beauty that pulsed and throbbed.\u0027Sit down, sit down... \u0027 he said to me, those feverish hands against my chest, clasped by my hands, yet sliding away, my hunger rising in waves.\n \"And now I saw him at a distance, eyes intent, the palette in his hand, the huge canvas obscuring the arm that moved. And mindless and helpless, I sat there drifting with his paintings, drifting with those adoring eyes, letting it go on and on till Armand\u0027s eyes were gone and Claudia was running down that stone passage with clicking heels away from me, away from me.\n \"\u0027You are alive... : I whispered.\u0027Bones,\u0027 he answered me.\u0027Bones... \u0027 And I saw them in heaps, taken from those shallow graves in New Orleans as they are and put in chambers behind the sepulcher so that another can be laid in that narrow plot. I felt my eyes close; I felt my hunger become agony, my heart crying out for a living heart; and then I felt him moving forward, hands out to right my face-that fatal step, that fatal lurch. A sigh escaped my lips.\u0027Save yourself,\u0027 I whispered to him.\u0027Beware.\u0027\n \"And then something happened in the moist radiance of his face, something drained the broken vessels of his fragile skin. He backed away from me, the . brush falling from ills hands. And I rose over him, feeling my teeth against my lip, feeling my eyes fill with the colors of his face, my ears fill with his struggling cry, my hands fill with that strong, fighting flesh until I drew him up to me, helpless, and tore that flesh and had the blood that gave it life.\u0027Die,\u0027 I whispered when I held him loose now, his head bowed against my coat,\u0027die,\u0027 and felt him struggle to look up at. me. And again I drank and again he fought, until at last he slipped, limp and shocked and near to death, on the floor. Yet his eyes did not close.\n \"I settled before his canvas, weak, at peace, gazing down at him, at his vague, graying eyes, my own hands florid, my skin so luxuriously warm.\u0027I am mortal again,\u0027 I whispered to him.\u0027I am alive. With your blood I am alive.\u0027 His eyes closed. I sank back against the wall and found myself gazing at my own face.\n \"A sketch was all he\u0027d done, a series of bold black lines that nevertheless made up my face and shoulders perfectly, and the color was already begun in dabs and splashes: the green of my eyes, the white of my cheek. But the horror, the horror of seeing my expression! For he had captured it perfectly, and there was nothing of horror in it. Those green eyes gazed at me from out of that loosely drawn shape with a mindless innocence, the expressionless wonder of that overpowering craving which he had not understood. Louis of a hundred years ago lost in listening to the sermon of the priest at Mass, lips parted and slack, hair careless, a hand curved in the lap and limp. A mortal Louis. I believe I was laughing, putting my hands to my face and laughing so that the tears nearly rose in my eyes; and when I took my fingers down, there was the stain of the tears, tinged with mortal blood. And already there was begun in me the tingling of the monster that had killed, and would kill again, who was gathering up the painting now and starting to flee with it from the small house.\n \"When suddenly, up from the floor, the man rose with an animal groan and clutched at my boot, his hands sliding off the leather. With some colossal spirit that defied me, he reached up for the painting and held fast to it with his whitening hands.\u0027Give it back!\u0027 he growled at me.\u0027Give it back!\u0027 And we held fast, the two of us, I staring at him and at my own hands that held so easily what he sought so desperately to rescue, as if he would take it to heaven or hell; I the thing that his blood could not make human, he the man that my evil had not overcome. And then, as if I were not myself, I tore the painting loose from him and, wrenching him up to my lips with one arm, gashed his throat in rage.\"\n \"Entering the rooms of the Hotel Saint-Gabriel, I set the picture on the mantel above the fire and looked at it a long time. Claudia was somewhere in the rooms, and some other presence intruded, as though on one of the balconies above a woman or a man stood near, giving off an unmistakable personal perfume. I didn\u0027t know why I had taken the picture, why I\u0027d fought for it so that it shamed me now worse than the death, and why I still held onto it at the marble mantel, my head bowed, my hands visibly trembling. And then slowly I turned my head. I wanted the rooms to take shape around me; I wanted the flowers, the velvet, the candles in their sconces. To be mortal and trivial and safe. And then, as if in a mist, I saw a woman there.\n \"She was seated calmly at that lavish table where Claudia attended to her hair; and so still she sat, so utterly without fear, her green taffeta sleeves reflected in the tilted mirrors, her skirts reflected, that she was not one still woman but a gathering of women. Her dark-red hair was parted in the middle and drawn back to her ears, though a dozen little ringlets escaped to make a frame for her pale face. And she was looking at me with two calm, violet eyes and a child\u0027s mouth that seemed almost obdurately soft, obdurately the cupid\u0027s bow unsullied by paint or personality; and the mouth smiled now and said, as those eyes seemed to fire:\u0027Yes, he\u0027s as you said he would be, and I love him already. He\u0027s as you said.\u0027 She rose now, gently lifting that abundance of dark taffeta, and the three small mirrors emptied at once.\n \"And utterly baffled and almost incapable of speech, I turned to see Claudia far off on the immense bed, her small face rigidly calm, though she clung to the silk curtain with a tight fist. \u0027Madeleine,\u0027 she said under her breath,\u0027Louis is shy.\u0027 And she watched with cold eyes as Madeleine only smiled when she said this and, drawing closer to me, put both of her hands to the lace fringe around her throat, moving it back so I could see the two small marks there. Then the smile died on her lips, and they became at once sullen and sensual as her eyes narrowed and she breathed the word,\u0027Drink.\u0027\n \"I turned away from her, my fist rising in a consternation for which I couldn\u0027t find words. But then Claudia had hold of that fist and was looking up at me with relentless eyes.\u0027Do it, Louis,\u0027 she commanded.\u0027Because I cannot do it.\u0027 Her voice was painfully calm, all the emotion under the hard, measured tone.\u0027I haven\u0027t the size, I haven\u0027t the strength! You saw to that when you made me! Do it!\u0027\n \"I broke away from her, clutching my wrist as if she\u0027d burned it. I could see the door, and it seemed to me the better part of wisdom to leave by it at once. I could feel Claudia\u0027s strength, her will, and the mortal woman\u0027s eyes seemed afire with that same will. But Claudia held me, not with a gentle pleading, a miserable coaxing that would have dissipated that power, making me feel pity for her as I gathered my own forces. She held me with the emotion her eyes had evinced even through her coldness and the way that she turned away from me now, almost as if she\u0027d been instantly defeated. I did not understand the manner in which she sank back on the bed, her head bowed, her lips moving feverishly, her eyes rising only to scan the walls. I wanted to touch her and say to her that what she asked was impossible; I wanted to soothe that fire that seemed to be consuming her from within.\n \"And the soft, mortal woman had settled into one of the velvet chairs by the fire, with the rustling and iridescence of her taffeta dress surrounding her like part of the mystery of her, of her dispassionate eyes which watched us now, the fever of her pale face. I remember turning to her, spurred on by that childish, pouting mouth set against the fragile face. The vampire kiss had left no visible trace except the wound, no inalterable change on the pale pink flesh.\u0027How do we appear to you?\u0027 I asked, seeing her eyes on Claudia. She seemed excited by the diminutive beauty, the awful woman\u0027s-passion knotted in the small dimpled hands.\n \"She broke her gaze and looked up at me.\u0027I ask you... how do we appear? Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? (r)h, I remember perfectly what mortal vision was, the dimness of it, and how the vampire\u0027s beauty burned through that veil, so powerfully alluring, so utterly deceiving! Drink, you tell me. You haven\u0027t the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!\u0027\n \"But Claudia rose from the bed and came towards me.\u0027How dare you!\u0027 she whispered.\u0027How dare you make this decision for both of us! Do you know how I despise you! Do you know that I despise you with a passion that eats at me like a canker!\u0027 Her small form trembled, her hands hovering over the pleated bodice of her yellow gown.\u0027Don\u0027t you look away from me! I am sick at heart with your looking away, with your suffering. You understand nothing. Your evil is that you cannot be evil, and I must suffer for it. I tell you, I will suffer no longer!\u0027 Her fingers bit into the flesh of my wrist; I twisted, stepping back from her, foundering in the face of the hatred, the rage rising like some dormant beast in her, looking out through her eyes.\u0027Snatching me from mortal hands like two grim monsters in a nightmare fairy tale, you idle, blind parents! Fathers!\u0027 She spat the word.\u0027Let tears gather in your eyes. You haven\u0027t tears enough for what you\u0027ve done to me. Six more mortal years, seven, eight... I might have had that shape!\u0027 Her pointed finger flew at Madeleine, whose hands had risen to her face, whose eyes were clouded over. Her moan was almost Claudia\u0027s name. But Claudia did not hear her.\u0027Yes, that shape, I might have known what it was to walk at your side. Monsters! To give me immortality in this hopeless guise, this helpless form!\u0027 The tears stood in her eyes. The words had died away, drawn in, as it were, on her breast.\n \"\u0027Now, you give her to met\u0027 she said, her head bowing, her curls tumbling down to make a concealing veil.\u0027You give her to me. You do this, or you finish what you did to me that night in the hotel in New Orleans. I will not live with this hatred any longer, I will not live with this rage! I cannot. I will not abide it!\u0027 And tossing her hair, she put her hands to her ears as if to stop the sound of her own words, her breath, drawn in rapid gasps, the tears seeming to scald her cheeks.\n \"I had sunk to my knees at her side, and my arms were outstretched as if to enfold her. Yet I dared not touch her, dared not even say her name, lest my own pain break from me with the first syllable in a monstrous outpouring of hopelessly inarticulate cries.\u0027Oooh.\u0027 She shook her head now, squeezing the tears out onto her cheeks, her teeth clenched tight together.\u0027I love you still, that\u0027s the torment of it. Lestat I never loved. But you! The measure of my hatred is that love. They are the same! Do you know now how much I hate you!\u0027 She flashed at me through the red film that covered her eyes.\n \"\u0027Yes,\u0027 I whispered. I bowed my head. But she was gone from me into the arms of Madeleine, who enfolded her desperately, as if she might protect Claudia from me-the irony of it, the pathetic irony-protect Claudia from herself. She ,was whispering to Claudia,\u0027Don\u0027t cry, don\u0027t cry?\u0027 her hands stroking Claudia\u0027s face and hair with a fierceness that would have bruised a human child.\n \"But Claudia seemed lost against her breast suddenly, her eyes closed, her face smooth, as if all passion were drained away from her, her arm sliding up around Madeleine\u0027s neck, her head falling against the taffeta and lace. She lay still, the tears staining her cheeks, as if all this that had risen to the surface had left her weak and desperate for oblivion, as if the room around her, as if I, were not there.\n \"And there they were together, a tender mortal crying unstintingly now, her warm arms holding what she could not possibly understand, this white and fierce and unnatural child thing she believed she loved. And if I had not felt for her, this mad and reckless woman flirting with the damned, if I had not felt all the sorrow for her I felt for my mortal self, I would have wrested the demon thing from her arms, held it tight to me, denying over and over the words I\u0027d just heard. But I knelt there still, thinking only, The love is equal to the hatred; gathering that selfishly to my own breast, holding onto that as I sank back against the bed.\n \"A long time before Madeleine was to know it, Claudia had ceased crying and sat still as a statue on Madeleine\u0027s lap, her liquid eyes fixed on me, oblivious to the soft, red hair that fell around her or the woman\u0027s hand that still stroked her. And I sat slumped against the bedpost, staring back at those vampire eyes, unable and unwilling to speak in my defense. Madeleine was whispering into Claudia\u0027s ear, she was letting her tears fall into Claudia\u0027s tresses. And then gently, Claudia said to her,\u0027Leave us.\u0027\n \"\u0027No.\u0027 She shook her head, holding fight to Claudia. And then she shut her eyes and trembled all over with some terrible vexation, some awful torment. But Claudia was leading her from the chair, and she was now pliant and shocked and white-faced, the green taffeta ballooning around the\u0027 small yellow silk dress.\n \"In the archway of the parlor they stopped, and Madeleine stood as if confused, her hand at her throat, beating like a wing, then going still. She looked about her like that hapless victim on the stage of the Theatre des Vampires who did not know where she was. But Claudia had gone for something. And I saw her emerge from the shadows with what appeared to be a large doll. I rose on my knees to look at it. It was a doll, the doll of a little girl with raven hair and green eyes, adorned with lace and ribbons, sweet-faced and wide-eyed, its porcelain feet tinkling as Claudia put it into Madeleine\u0027s arms. And Madeleine\u0027s eyes appeared to harden as she held the doll, and her Lips drew back from her teeth in a grimace as she stroked its hair. She was laughing low under her breath.\u0027Lie down,\u0027 Claudia said to her; and together they appeared to sink into the cushions of the couch, the green taffeta rustling and giving way as Claudia lay with her and put her arms around her neck. I saw the doll sliding, dropping to the floor, yet Madeleine\u0027s hand moped for it and held it dangling, her own head thrown back, her eyes shut tight, and Claudia\u0027s curls stroking her face.\n \"I settled back on the floor and leaned against the soft siding of the bed. Claudia was speaking now in a low voice, barely above a whisper, telling Madeleine to be patient, to be still, I dreaded the sound of her step on the carpet; the sound of the doors sliding closed to shut Madeleine away from us, and the hatred that lay between us like a killing vapor.\n \"But when I looked up to her, Claudia was standing there as if transfixed and lost in thought, all rancor and bitterness gone from her face, so that she had the blank expression of that doll.\n \" \u0027All you\u0027ve said to me is true,\u0027 I said to her.\u0027I deserve your hatred. I\u0027ve deserved it from those first moments when Lestat put you in my arms.\u0027\n \"She seemed unaware of me, and her eyes were infused with a soft light. Her beauty burned into my soul so that I could hardly stand it, and then she said, wondering,\u0027You could have killed me then, despite him. You could have done it.\u0027 Then her eyes rested on me calmly.\u0027Do you wish to do it now?\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/interview-with-the-vampire-the-vampire-chronicles-1/page-24.html","bookId":2209,"book":{"id":2209,"title":"Interview with the Vampire (The Vampire Chronicles #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Interview With The Vampire (The Vampire Chronicles #1) \n Here are the confessions of a vampire.
