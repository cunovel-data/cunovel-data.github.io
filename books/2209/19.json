My expression can\u0027t convey. it now, for what Paris means to me is very different from what it meant then, in those days, at that hour; but still, even now, to think of it, I feel something akin to that happiness. And I\u0027ve more reason now than ever to say that happiness is not what I will ever know, or will ever deserve to know. I am not so much in love with happiness. Yet the name Paris makes me feel it.\n \"Mortal beauty often makes me ache, and mortal grandeur can fill me with that longing I felt so hopelessly in the Mediterranean Sea. But Paris, Paris drew me close to her heart, so I forgot myself entirely. Forgot the damned and questing preternatural thing that doted on mortal skin and mortal clothing. Paris overwhelmed, and lightened and rewarded more richly than any promise.\n \"It was the mother of New Orleans, understand that first; it had given New Orleans its life, its first populace; and it was what New Orleans had for so long tried to be. But New Orleans, though beautiful and desperately alive, was desperately fragile. There was something forever savage and primitive there, something that threatened the exotic and sophisticated life both from within and without. Not an inch of those wooden streets nor a brick of the crowded Spanish houses had not been bought from the fierce wilderness that forever surrounded the city, ready to engulf it. Hurricanes, floods, fevers, the plague-and the damp of the Louisiana climate itself worked tirelessly on every hewn plank or stone facade, so that New Orleans seemed at all times like a dream in the imagination of her striving populace, a dream held intact at every second by a tenacious, though unconscious, collective will.\n \"But Paris, Paris was a universe whole and entire unto herself, hollowed and fashioned by history; so she seemed in this age of Napoleon III with her towering buildings, her massive cathedrals, her grand boulevards and ancient winding medieval streets-as vast and indestructible as nature itself. All was embraced by her, by her volatile and enchanted populace thronging the galleries, the theaters, the cafes, giving birth over and over to genius and sanctity, philosophy and war, frivolity and the finest art; so it seemed that if all the world outside her were to sink into darkness, what was fine, what was beautiful, what was essential might there still come to its finest flower. Even the majestic trees that graced and sheltered her streets were attuned to her--and the waters of the Seine, contained and beautiful as they wound through her heart; so that the earth on that spot, so shaped by blood and consciousness, had ceased to be the earth and had become Paris.\n \"We were alive again. We were in love, and so euphoric was I after those hopeless nights of wandering in eastern Europe that I yielded completely when Claudia moved us into the Hote1 Saint-Gabriel on the Boulevard des Capucines. It was rumored to be one of the largest hotels in Europe, its immense rooms dwarfing the memory of our old town house, while at the same time recalling it with a comfortable splendor. We were to have one of the finest suites. Our windows looked out over the gas-lit boulevard itself where, in the early evening, the asphalt sidewalks teemed with strollers and an endless stream of carriages flowed past, taking lavishly dressed ladies and their gentlemen to the Opera or the Opera Comique, the ballet, the theaters, the balls and receptions without end at the Tuileries.\n \"Claudia put her reasons for expense to me gently and logically, but I could see that she became impatient ordering everything through me; it was wearing for her. The hotel, she said, quietly afforded us complete freedom, our nocturnal habits going unnoticed in the continual press of European tourists, our rooms immaculately maintained by an anonymous staff, while the immense price we paid guaranteed our privacy and our security. But there was more to it than that. There was a feverish purpose to her buying.\n \"\u0027This is my world,\u0027 she explained to me as she sat in a small velvet chair before the open balcony, watching the long row of broughams stopping one by one before the hotel doors.\u0027I must have it as I like,\u0027 she said, as if speaking to herself. And so it was as she liked, stunning wallpaper of rose and gold, an abundance of damask and velvet furniture, embroidered pillows and silk trappings for the fourposter bed. Dozens of roses appeared daily for the marble .mantels and the inlaid tables, crowding the curtained alcove of her dressing room, reflected endlessly in tilted mirrors. And finally she crowded the high French windows with a veritable garden of camellia and fern.\u0027I miss the flowers; more than anything else I miss the flowers,\u0027 she mused. And sought after them even in the paintings which we brought from the shops and the galleries, magnificent canvases such as I\u0027d never seen in New Orleans-from the classically executed lifelike bouquets, tempting you to reach for the petals that fell on a three-dimensional tablecloth, to a new and disturbing style in which the colors seemed to blaze with such intensity they destroyed the old lines, the old solidity, to make a vision like to those states when I\u0027m nearest my delirium and flowers grow before my eyes and crackle like the flames of lamps. Paris flowed into these rooms.\n \"I found myself at home there, again forsaking dreams of ethereal simplicity for what another\u0027s gentle insistence had given me, because the air was sweet like the air of our courtyard in the Rue Royale, and all was alive with a shocking profusion of gas light that rendered even the ornate lofty ceilings devoid of shadows. The light raced on the gilt curlicues, flickered in the baubles of the chandeliers. Darkness did not exist. Vampires did not exist.\n \"And even bent as I was on my quest, \u0027 it was sweet to think that, for an hour, father and daughter climbed into the cabriolet from such civilized luxury only to ride along the banks of the Seine, over the bridge into the Latin Quarter to roam those darker, narrower streets in search of history, not victims. And then to return to the ticking clock and the brass andirons and the playing cards laid out upon the table. Books of poets, the program from a play, and all around the soft humming of the vast hotel, distant violins, a woman talking in a rapid, animated voice above the zinging of a hairbrush, and a man high above on the top floor repeating over and over to the night air,\u0027I understand, I am just beginning, I am just beginning to understand....\n `Is it as you would have it?\u0027 Claudia asked, perhaps just to let me know she hadn\u0027t forgotten me, for she was quiet now for hours; no talk of vampires. But something was wrong. It was not the old serenity, the pensiveness that was recollection. There was a brooding there, a smoldering dissatisfaction. And though it would vanish from her eyes when I would call to her or answer her, anger seemed to settle very near the surface.\n \"\u0027Oh, you know how I would have it,\u0027 I answered, persisting in the myth of my own will.\u0027Some garret near the Sorbonne, near enough to the noise of the Rue St. Michel, far enough away. But I would mainly have it as you would have it\u0027 And I could see her warmed, but looking past me, as if to say,\u0027You have no remedy; don\u0027t draw too near; don\u0027t ask of me what I ask of you: are you content?\u0027\n \"My memory is too clear; too sharp; things should wear at the edges, and what is unresolved should soften. So, scenes are near my heart like pictures in lockets, yet monstrous pictures no artist or camera would ever catch; and over and over I would see Claudia at the piano\u0027s edge that last night when Lestat was playing, preparing to die, her face when he was taunting her, that contortion that at once became a mask; attention might have saved his life, if, in fact, he were dead at all.\n \"Something was collecting in Claudia, revealing itself slowly to the most unwilling witness in the world. She had a new passion for rings and bracelets children did not wear. Her jaunty, straight-backed walk was not a child\u0027s, and often she entered small boutiques ahead of me and pointed a commanding finger at the perfume or the gloves she would then pay for herself. I was never far away, and always uncomfortable--not because I feared anything in this vast city, but because I feared her. She\u0027d always been the\u0027lost child\u0027 to her victims, the\u0027orphan,\u0027 and now it seemed she would be something else, something wicked and shocking to the passers-by who succumbed to her. But this was often private; I was left for an hour haunting the carved edifices of Notre-Dame, or sitting at the edge of a park in the carriage.\n \"And then one night, when I awoke on the lavish bed in the suite of the hotel, my book crunched uncomfortably under me, I found her gone altogether. I didn\u0027t dare ask the attendants if they\u0027d seen her. It was our practice to spirit past them; we had no name. I searched the corridors for her, the side streets, even the ballroom, where some almost inexplicable dread came over me at the thought of her there alone. But then I finally saw her coming through the side doors of the lobby, her hair beneath her bonnet brim sparkling from the light rain, the child rushing as if on a mischievous escapade, lighting the faces of doting men and women as she mounted the grand staircase and passed me, as if she hadn\u0027t seen me at all. An impossibility, a strange graceful slight.\n \"I shut the door behind me just as she was taking off her cape, and, in a flurry of golden raindrops, she shook it, shook her hair. The ribbons crushed from the bonnet fell loose and I felt a palpable relief to see the childish dress, those ribbons, and something wonderfully comforting in her arms, a small china doll. Still she said nothing to me; she was fussing with the doll. Jointed somehow with hooks or wire beneath its flouncing dress, its tiny feet tinkled like a bell.\u0027it\u0027s a lady, doll,\u0027 she said, looking up at me.\u0027See? A lady doll.\u0027 She put it on the dresser.\n \" \u0027So it is,\u0027 I whispered.\n \"\u0027A woman made it,\u0027 she said.\u0027She makes baby dolls, all the same, baby dolls, a shop of baby dolls, until I said to her, \"I want a lady doll.\"\u0027\n \"It was taunting, mysterious. She sat there now with the wet strands of hair streaking her high forehead, intent on that doll.\u0027Do you know why she made it for me?\u0027 she asked. I was wishing now the room had shadows, that I could retreat from the warm circle of the superfluous fire into some darkness, that I wasn\u0027t sitting on the bed as if on a lighted stage, seeing her before me and in her mirrors, puffed sleeves and puffed sleeves.\n \"\u0027Because you are a beautiful child and she wanted to make you happy,\u0027 I said, my voice small and foreign to myself.\n \"She was laughing soundlessly.\u0027A beautiful child,\u0027 she said glancing up at me. \u0027Is that what you still think I am?\u0027 And her face went dark as again she played with the doll, her fingers pushing the tiny crocheted neckline down toward the china breasts.\u0027Yes, I resemble her baby dolls, I am her baby dolls. You should see her working in that shop; bent on her dolls, each with the same face, lips.\u0027 Her finger touched her own lip. Something seemed to shift suddenly, something within the very walls of the room itself, and the mirrors trembled with her image as if the earth had sighed beneath the foundations. Carriages rumbled in the streets; but they were too far away. And then I saw what her still childish figure was doing: in one hand she held the doll, the other to her lips; and the hand that held the doll was crushing it, crushing it and popping it so it bobbed and broke in a heap of glass that fell now from her open, bloody hand onto the carpet. She wrung the tiny dress to make a shower of littering particles as I averted my eyes, only to see her in the tilted mirror over the fire, see her eyes scanning me from my feet to the top of my head. She moved through that mirror towards me and drew close on the bed.\n \"\u0027Why do you look away, why don\u0027t you look at me?\u0027 she asked, her voice very smooth, very like a silver bell. But then she laughed softly, a woman\u0027s laugh, and said,\u0027Did you think I\u0027d be your daughter forever? Are you the father of fools, the fool of fathers?\u0027\n \"\u0027Your tone is unkind with me,\u0027 I answered.\n \"\u0027Hmmm... unkind.\u0027 I think she nodded. She was a blaze in the corner of my eye, blue flames, golden flames.\n \"\u0027And what do they think of you,\u0027 I asked as gently as I could,\u0027out there?\u0027 I gestured to the open window.\n \"\u0027Many things.\u0027 She smiled.\u0027Many things. Men are marvelous at explanations: Have you see the \"little people\" in the parks, the circuses, the freaks that men pay money to laugh at?\u0027\n \"\u0027I was a sorcerer\u0027s apprentice only!\u0027 I burst out suddenly, despite myself.\u0027Apprentice!\u0027 I said. I wanted to touch her, to stroke her hair, but I sat there afraid of her, her anger like a match about to kindle.\n \"Again she smiled, and then she drew my hand into her lap and covered it as best she could with her own.\u0027Apprentice, yes,\u0027 she laughed.\u0027But tell me one thing, one thing from that lofty height. What was it like... making love?\u0027\n \"I was walking away from her before I meant to, I was searching like a dim-wilted mortal man for cape and gloves.\u0027You don\u0027t remember?\u0027 she asked with perfect calm, as I put my hand on the brass door handle.\n \"I stopped, feeling her eyes on my back, ashamed, and then I turned around and made as if to think, Where am I going, what shall I do, why do I stand here?\n \"\u0027It was something hurried,\u0027 I said, trying now to meet her eyes. How perfectly, coldly blue they were. How earnest.\u0027And... it was seldom savored... something acute that was quickly lost. I think that it was the pale shadow of killing.\u0027\n \"\u0027Ahhh... \u0027 she said.\u0027Like hurting you as I do now... that is also the pale shadow of killing.\u0027\n \" \u0027Yes, madam,\u0027 I said to her.\u0027I am inclined to believe that is correct.\u0027 And bowing swiftly, I bade her good-night.\"\n \"It was a long time after I\u0027d left her that I slowed my pace. I\u0027d crossed the Seine. I wanted darkness. To hide from her and the feelings that welled up in me, and the great consuming fear that I was utterly inadequate to make her happy, or to make myself happy by pleasing her.\n \"I would have given the world to please her; the world we now possessed, which seemed at once empty and eternal. Yet I was injured by her words and by her eyes, and no amount of explanations to her which passed through and through my mind now, even forming on my lips in desperate whispers as I left the Rue St. Michel and went deeper and deeper into the older, darker streets of the Latin Quarter-no amount of explanations seemed to soothe what I imagined to be her grave dissatisfaction, or my own pain.\n \"Finally I left off words except for a strange chant.\n I was in the black silence of a medieval street, and blindly I followed its sharp turns, comforted by the height of its narrow tenements, which seemed at any moment capable of falling together, closing this alleyway under the indifferent stars like a seam.\u0027I cannot make her happy, I do not make her happy; and her unhappiness increases every day.\u0027 This was my chant, which I repeated like a rosary, a charm to change the facts, her inevitable disillusionment with our quest, which left us in this limbo where I felt her drawing away from me, dwarfing me with her enormous need. I even conceived a savage jealousy of the dollmaker to whom she\u0027d confided her request for that tinkling diminutive lady, because that dollmaker had for a moment given her something which she held close to herself in my presence as if I were not there at all.\n \"What did it amount to, where could it lead?\n \"Never since I\u0027d come to Paris months before did I so completely feel the city\u0027s immense size, how I might pass from this twisting, blind street of my choice into a world of delights, and never had I so keenly felt its uselessness. Uselessness to her if she could not abide this anger, if she could not somehow grasp the limits of which she seemed so angrily, bitterly aware. I was helpless. She was helpless. But she was stronger than I. And I knew, had known even at the moment when I turned away from her in the hotel, that behind her eyes there was for me her continuing love.\n \"And dizzy and weary and now comfortably lost, I became aware with a vampire\u0027s inextinguishable senses that I was being followed.\n \"my first thought was irrational. She\u0027d come out after me. And, cleverer than I, had tracked me at a great distance. But as surely as this came to mind, another thought presented itself, a rather cruel thought in light of all that had passed between us. The steps were too heavy for hers. It was just some mortal walking in this same alley, walking unwarily towards death.\n \"So I continued on, almost ready to fall into my pain again because I deserved it, when my mind said, You are a fool; listen. And it dawned on me that these steps, echoing as they were at a great distance behind me, were in perfect time with my own. An accident. Because if mortal they were, they were too far off for mortal hearing. But as I stopped now to consider that, they stopped. And as I turned saying, Louis, you deceive yourself, and started up, they started up. Footfall with my footfall, gaining-speed now as I gained speed. And then something remarkable, undeniable occurred. En garde as I was for the steps that were behind me, I tripped on a fallen roof tile and was pitched against the wall. And behind me, those steps echoed to perfection the sharp shuffling rhythm of my fall.\n \"I was astonished. And in a state of alarm well beyond fear. To the right and left of me the street was dark. Not even a tarnished light shone in a garret window. And the only safety afforded me, the great distance between myself and these steps, was as I said the guarantee that they were not human. I was at a complete loss as to what I might do. I had the nearirresistible desire to call out to this being and welcome it, to let it know as quickly and as completely as possible that I awaited it, had been searching for it, would confront it. Yet I was afraid. What seemed sensible was to resume walking, waiting for it to gain on me; and as I did so I was again mocked by my own pace, and the distance between us remained the same. The tension mounted in me, the dark around me becoming more and more menacing; and I said over and over, measuring these steps, Why do you track me, why do you let me know you are there?\n \"Then I rounded a sharp turn in the street, and a gleam of light showed ahead of me at the next corner. The street sloped up towards it, and I moved on very slowly, my heart deafening in my ears, reluctant to eventually reveal myself in that light.\n \"And as I hesitated-stopped, in fact right before the turn; something rumbled and clattered above, as if the roof of the house beside me had all but collapsed. I jumped back just in time, before a load of tiles crashed into the street, one of them brushing my shoulder. All was quiet now. I stared at the tiles, listening, waiting. And then slowly I edged around the turn into the light, only to see there looming over me at the top of the street beneath the gas lamp the unmistakable figure of another vampire.\n \" He was enormous in height though gaunt as myself, his long, white face very bright under the lamp, his large, black eyes staring .at me in what seemed undisguised wonder. His right leg was slightly bent as though he\u0027d just come to a halt in mid-step. And then suddenly I realized that not only was his black hair long and full and combed precisely like my own, and not only was he dressed in identical coat and cape to my own, but he stood imitating my stance and facial expression to perfection. I swallowed and let my eyes pass over him slowly, while I struggled t(r) hide from him the rapid pace of my pulse as his eyes in. like manner passed over me. And when I saw him blink I realized I had just blinked, and as I drew my arms up and folded them across my chest he slowly did the same. It was maddening. Worse than maddening. Because, as I barely moved my lips, he barely moved his lips, and I found the words dead and I couldn\u0027t make other words to confront this, to stop it. And all the while, there was that height and those sharp black eyes and that powerful attention which was, of course, perfect mockery, but nevertheless riveted to myself. He was the vampire; I seemed the mirror.\n \"\u0027Clever,\u0027 I said to him shortly and desperately, and, of course, he echoed that word as fast as I said it. And maddened as I was more by that than anything else, I found myself yielding to a slow smile, defying the sweat which had broken from every pore and the violent tremor in my legs. He also smiled, but his -eyes had a ferocity that was animal, unlike my own, and the smile was sinister in its sheer mechanical quality.\n \"Now I took a step forward and so did he; and when I ,stopped short, staring, so did he. But then he slowly, very slowly, lifted his right arm, though mine remained poised and gathering his fingers into a fist, he now struck at his chest in quickening time to mock my heartbeat. Laughter erupted from him. He threw back his head, showing his canine teeth, and the laughter seemed to fill the alleyway. I loathed him. Completely.\n \"\u0027You mean me harm?\u0027 I asked, only to hear the words mockingly obliterated.\n \"\u0027Trickster!\u0027 I said sharply. Buffoon!\u0027\n \"That word stopped him. Died on his lips even as he was saying it, and his face went hard.\n \"What I did then was impulse. I turned my back on him and started away, perhaps to make him come after me and demand to know who I was. But in a movement so swift I couldn\u0027t possibly have seen it, he stood before me again, as if he had materialized there. Again I turned my back on him-only to face him under the lamp again, the settling of his dark, wavy hair the only indication that he had in fact moved.\n \"\u0027I\u0027ve been looking for you! I\u0027ve come to Paris looking for you!\u0027 I forced myself to say the words, seeing that he didn\u0027t echo them or move, only stood staring at me.\n \"Now he moved forward slowly, gracefully, and I saw his own body and his own manner had regained possession of him and, extending his hand as if he meant to ask for mine, he very suddenly pushed me backwards, off-balance. I could feel my shirt drenched and sticking to my flesh as I righted myself, my hand grimed from the damp wall.\n \"And as I turned to confront him, he threw me completely down. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/interview-with-the-vampire-the-vampire-chronicles-1/page-19.html","bookId":2209,"book":{"id":2209,"title":"Interview with the Vampire (The Vampire Chronicles #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Interview With The Vampire (The Vampire Chronicles #1) \n Here are the confessions of a vampire.
