{"id":102102,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"\"\u0027I\u0027ll give you back your life!\u0027 he said, his eyelids quivering with the stress of his words, his chest heaving, that hand going out again and closing impotently in the dark.\u0027You promised me,\u0027 he said to Santiago,\u0027I could take him back with me to New Orleans.\u0027 And then, as he looked from one to the other of them as they surrounded us, his breath became frantic, and he burst out, \u0027Claudia, where is she? She\u0027s the one who did it to me, I told you!\u0027 \"\u0027By and by,\u0027 said Santiago. And when he reached out for Lestat, Lestat drew back and almost lost his balance. He had found the chair arm he needed and stood holding fast to it, his eyes closed, regaining his control. \"\u0027But he helped her, aided her... \u0027 said Santiago, drawing nearer to him. Lestat looked up. \"\u0027No,\u0027 he said. \u0027Louis, you must come back to me. There\u0027s something I must tell you... about that night in the swamp.\u0027 But then he stopped and looked about again, as though he were caged, wounded, desperate. \"\u0027Listen to me, Lestat,\u0027 I began now.\u0027You let her go, you free her... and I will... I\u0027ll return to you,\u0027 I said, the words sounding hollow, metallic. I tried to take a step towards him, to make my eyes hard and unreadable, to feel my power emanating from them like two beams of light. He was looking at me, studying me, struggling all the while against his own fragility. And Celeste had her hand on my wrist.\u0027You must tell them,\u0027 I went on,\u0027how you treated us, that we didn\u0027t know the laws, that she didn\u0027t know of other vampires,\u0027 I said. And I was thinking steadily, as that mechanical voice came out of me: Armand must return tonight, Armand must come back. He will stop this, he won\u0027t let it go on. \"\u0027There was a sound then of something dragging across the floor. I could hear Madeleine\u0027s exhausted crying. I looked around and saw her in a chair, and when she saw my eyes on her, her terror seemed to increase. She tried to rise but they stopped her.\u0027Lestat,\u0027 I said.\u0027What do you want of me? I\u0027ll give it to you.... \"And then I saw the thing that was making the noise. And Lestat had seen it too. It was a coffin with large iron locks on it that was being dragged into the room. I understood at once.\u0027Where is Armand?\u0027 I said desperately. \"\u0027She did it to me, Louis. She did it to me. You didn\u0027t! She has to dies\u0027 said Lestat, his voice becoming thin, rasping, as if it were an effort for him to speak.\u0027Get that thing away from here, he\u0027s coming home with me,\u0027 he said furiously to Santiago. And Santiago only laughed, and Celeste laughed, and the laughter seemed to infect them all. \"\u0027You promised me,\u0027 said Lestat to them. \"\u0027I promised you nothing,\u0027 said Santiago. \"\u0027They\u0027ve made a fool of you,\u0027 I said to him bitterly as they were opening the coffin. \u0027A fool of you! You must reach Armand, Armand 13 the leader here,\u0027 I burst out. But he didn\u0027t seem to understand. \"What happened then was desperate axed clouded and miserable, my kicking at them, struggling to free my arms, raging against them that Armand would stop what they were doing, that they dare not hurt Claudia. Yet they forced me down into the coffin, my frantic efforts serving no purpose against them except to take my mind off the sound of Madeleine\u0027s cries, her awful wailing cries, and the fear that at any moment Claudia\u0027s cries might be added to them. I remember rising against the crushing lid, holding it at bay for an instant before it was forced shut on me and the locks were being shut with the grinding of metal and keys. Words of long ago came back to me, a strident and smiling Lestat in that faraway, trouble-free place where the three of us had, quarreled together:\u0027A starving child is a frightful sight... a starving vampire even worse. They\u0027d hear her screams in Paris.\u0027 And my wet and trembling body went limp in the suffocating coffin, and I said, Armand will not let it happen; there isn\u0027t a place secure enough for them to place us. \"The coffin was lifted, there was the scraping of boots, the swinging from side to side; my arms braced against the sides of the box, my eyes shut perhaps for a moment, I was uncertain. I told myself not to reach out for the sides, not to feel the thin margin of air between my face and the lid; and I felt the coffin swing and tilt as their steps found the stairs. Vainly I tried to make out Madeleine\u0027s cries, for it seemed that she was crying for Claudia, calling out to her as if she could help us all. Call for Armand; he must come home this night, I thought desperately. And only the thought of the awful humiliation of hearing my own cry closed in with me, flooding my ears, yet locked in with me, prevented me from calling out. \"But another thought had come over me even as 1\u0027d phrased those words: What if he did not come? What if somewhere in that mansion he had a coffin hidden to which he returned... B And then it seemed my body broke suddenly, without warning, from the control of my mind, and I flailed at the wood around me, struggling to turn over and pit the strength of my back against the coffin lid. Yet I could not: it was too close; and my head fell back on the boards, and the sweat poured down my back and sides. \"Madeleine\u0027s cries were gone. All I heard were the boots, and my own breathing. Then, tomorrow night he will come-yes, tomorrow night and they will tell him, and he will find us and release us. The coffin swayed. The smell of water filled my nostrils, its coolness palpable through the close heat of the coffin; and then with the smell of the water was the smell of the deep earth. The coffin was set down roughly, and my limbs ached and I rubbed the backs of my arms with my hands, struggling not to touch the coffin lid, not to sense how close it was, afraid of my own feat rising to panic, to terror. \"I thought they would leave me now, but they did not. They were near at hand and bogy, and another odor came to my nostrils which was raw and not known to me. But then, as I lay very still, I realized they were laying bricks and that the odor came from the mortar. Slowly, carefully, I brought my hand up to wipe my face. All right, then, tomorrow night, I reasoned with myself, even as my shoulders seemed to grow large against the coffin walls. All right, then, tomorrow night he will come; and until then this is merely the confines of my own coffin, the price I\u0027ve paid for all of this, night after night after night. `But the tears were welling in my eyes, and I could see myself flailing again at the wood; and y head was turning from side to side, my mind rushing on to tomorrow and the night after and the night after that. And then, as if to distract myself from this madness, I thought of Claudia-only to feel her arms around me in the dim light of those rooms in the Hotel Saint-Gabriel, only to see the curve of her cheek in the light, the soft, languid flutter of her eyelashes, the silky touch of her lip. My body stiffened, my feet kicked at the boards. The sound of the bricks was gone, and the muffled steps were gone. And I cried out for her, \u0027Claudia,\u0027 until my neck was twisted with pain as I tossed, and my nails had dug into my palms; and slowly, like an icy stream, the paralysis of sleep came over me. I tried to call out to Armand-foolishly, desperately, only dimly aware as my lids grew heavy and my hands lay limp that the sleep was on him too somewhere, that he lay still in his resting place. One last time I struggled. My eyes saw the dark, my hands felt the wood. But I was weak. And then there was nothing.\" \"I awoke to a voice. It was distant but distinct. It said my name twice. For an instant I didn\u0027t know where I was. I\u0027d been dreaming, something desperate which was threatening to vanish completely without the slightest clue to what it had been, and something terrible which I was eager, willing to let go. Then I opened my eyes and felt the top of the coffin. I knew where I was at the same instant that, mercifully, I knew it was Armand who was calling me. I answered him, but my voice was locked in with me and it was deafening. In a moment of terror, I thought, He\u0027s searching for me, and I can\u0027t tell him that I am here. But then I heard him speaking to me, telling me not to be afraid. And I heard a loud noise. And another. And there was a cracking sound, and then the thunderous falling of the bricks. It seemed several of them struck the coffin. And then I heard them lifted off one by one. It sounded as though he were pulling off the locks by the nails. \"The hard wood of the top creaked. A pinpoint of light sparkled before my eyes. I drew breath from it, and felt the sweat break out on my face. The lid creaked open and for an instant I was blinded; then I was sitting up, seeing the bright light of a lamp through my fingers. \"\u0027Hurry,\u0027 he said to me. \u0027Don\u0027t make a sound\u0027 \"\u0027But where are we going?\u0027 I asked. I could see a passage of rough bricks stretching out from the doorway he\u0027d broken down. And all along that passage were doors which were sealed, as this door had been. I had a vision at once of coffins behind those bricks, of vampires starved and decayed there. But Armand was pulling me up, telling me again to make no sound; we were creeping along the passage. He stopped at a wooden door, and then he extinguished the lamp. It was completely black for an instant until the seam of light beneath the door brightened. He opened the door so gently the hinges did not make a sound. I could hear my own breathing now, and I tried to stop it. We were entering that lower passageway which led to his cell. But as I raced along behind him I became aware of one awful truth. He was rescuing me, but me alone. I put out my hand to stop him, but he only pulled me after him. Only when we stood in the alleyway beside the Theatre des Vampires was I able to make him stop. And even then, he was on the verge of going on. He began shaking his head even before I spoke. \"\u0027I can\u0027t save her!\u0027 he said. \"\u0027You don\u0027t honestly expect me to leave without her! They have her in there!\u0027 I was horrified. \u0027Armand, you must save her! You have no choice!\u0027 \"\u0027Why do you say this?\u0027 he answered.\u0027I don\u0027t have the power, you must understand. They\u0027ll rise against me. There is no reason why they should not. Louis, I tell you, I cannot save her. I will only risk losing you. You can\u0027t go back.\u0027 \"I refused to admit this could be true. I had no hope other than Armand. But I can truthfully say that I was beyond being afraid. I knew only that I had to get Claudia back or die in the effort. It was really very simple; not a matter of courage at all. And I knew also, could tell in everything about Armand\u0027s passivity, the manner in which he spoke, that he would follow me if I returned, that he would not try to prevent me. \"I was right. I was rushing back into the passage and he was just behind me, heading for the stairway to the ballroom. I could hear the ether vampires. I could hear all manner of sounds. The Paris traffic. What sounded very much like a congregation in the vault of the theater above. And then, as I reached the top of the steps, I saw Celeste in the door of the ballroom. She held one of those stage masks in her hand. She was merely looking at me. She did not appear alarmed. In fact, she appeared strangely indifferent. \"If she had rushed at me, if she had sounded a general alarm, these things I could have understood. But she did nothing. She stepped backwards into the ballroom; she turned, seeming to enjoy the subtle movement of her skirts, seeming to turn for the love of making her skirts flare out, and she drifted in a widening circle to the center of the room. She put the mask to her face, and said softly behind the painted skull,\u0027Lestat... it is your friend Louis come calling. Look sharp, Lestat!\u0027 She dropped the mask, and there was a ripple of laughter from somewhere. I saw they were all about the room, shadowy things, seated here and there, standing together. And Lestat, in an armchair, sat with his shoulders hunched and his face turned away from me. It seemed he was working something with his hands, something I couldn\u0027t see; and slowly he looked up, his full yellow hair falling into his eyes. There was fear in them. It was undeniable. Now he was looking at Armand. And Armand was moving silently through the room with slow, steady steps, and all of the vampires moved back away from him, watching him.\u0027Bonsoir, Monsieur,\u0027 Celeste bowed to him as he passed her, that mask in her hand like a scepter. He did not look at her in particular. He looked down at Lestat.\u0027Are you satisfied?\u0027 he asked him. \"Lestat\u0027s gray eyes seemed to regard Armand with wonder, and his lips straggled to form a word. I could see that his eyes were filling with tears.\u0027Yes... : he whispered now, his hand struggling with the thing he concealed beneath his black cloak. But then he looked at me, and the tears spilled down his face.\u0027Louis,\u0027 he said, his voice deep and rich now with what seemed an unbearable struggle.\u0027Please, you must listen to me. You must come back.... \u0027 And then, bowing his head, he grimaced with shame. \"Santiago was laughing somewhere. Armand was saying softly to Lestat that he must get out, leave Paris; he was outcast. \"And Lestat sat there with his eyes closed, his face transfigured with his pain. It seemed the double of Lestat, some wounded, feeling creature I\u0027d never known.\u0027Please,\u0027 he said, the voice eloquent and gentle as he implored me. \"\u0027I can\u0027t talk to you here! I can\u0027t make you understand. You\u0027ll come with me... for only a little while... until I am myself again?\u0027 \"\u0027This is madness!... \u0027 I said, my hands rising suddenly to my temples.\u0027Where is she! Where is she!\u0027 I looked about me, at their still, passive faces, those inscrutable smiles.\u0027Lestat \u0027 I turned him now, grabbing at the black wool of his lapels: \"And then I\u0027 saw the think in his hands. I knew what it was. And in an instant rd ripped it from him and was staring at it, at the fragile silken thing that it was-Claudia\u0027s yellow dress. His hand rose to his lips, his face turned away. And the soft, subdued sops broke from him as he sat back while I stared at him, while I stared at the dress. My fingers moved slowly over the tears in it, the stains of blood; my hands closing, trembling as I crushed it against my chest. \"For a long moment it seemed I simply stood there; time had no bearing upon me nor upon those shifting vampires with their light, ethereal laughter filling my ears. I remember thinking that I wanted to put my hands over my ears, but I wouldn\u0027t let go of the dress, couldn\u0027t stop trying to make it so small that it was hidden within my hands. I remember a row of candles burning, an uneven row coming to light one by one against the painted walls. A door stood open to the rain, and all the candies spluttered and blew on the wind as if the flames were being lifted from the wicks. But they clung to the wicks and were all right. I knew that Claudia was through the doorway. The candles moved. The vampires had hold of them. Santiago had a candle and was bowing to me and gesturing for me to pass through the door. I was barely aware of him. I didn\u0027t care about him or the others at all. Something in me said, If you care about them you will go mad. And they don\u0027t matter, really. She matters. Where is she? Find her. And their laughter was remote, and it seemed to have a color and a shape but to be part of nothing. \"Then I saw something through the open doorway which was something I\u0027d seen before, a long, long time ago. No one knew of this thing I\u0027d seen years before except myself. No. Lestat knew. But it didn\u0027t matter. He wouldn\u0027t know now or understand. That he and I had seen this thing, standing at the door of that brick kitchen in the Rue Royale, two wet shriveled things that had been alive, mother and daughter in one another\u0027s arms, the murdered pair on the kitchen floor. But these two lying under the gentle rain were Madeleine and Claudia, and Madeleine\u0027s lovely red hair mingled with the gold of Claudia\u0027s hair, which stirred and glistened in the wind that sucked through the open doorway. Only that which was living had been burnt away-not the hair, not the long, empty velvet dress, not the small bloodstained chemise with its eyelets of white lace. And the blackened, burnt, and drawn thing that was Madeleine -still bore the stamp of her living face, and the hand that clutched at the child was whole like a mummy\u0027s hand. But the child, the ancient one, my Claudia, was ashes. \"A cry rose in me, a wild, consuming cry that came from the bowels of my being, rising up like the wind in that narrow place, the wind that swirled the rains teeming on those ashes, beating at the trace of a tiny hand against the bricks, that golden hair lifting, those loose strands rising, flying upwards. And a blow struck me even as I cried out; and I had hold of something that I believed to be Santiago, and I was pounding, against him, destroying him, twisting that grinning white face around with hands from which he couldn\u0027t free himself, hands against which he railed, crying out, his cries mingling with my cries, his boots coming down into those ashes, as I threw him backwards away from them, my own eyes blinded with the rain, with my tears, until he lay back away from me, and I was reaching out for him even as he held out his hand. And the one I was struggling against was Armand. Armand, who was forcing me out of the tiny graveyard into the whirling colors of the ballroom, the cries, the mingling voices, that searing, silver laughter. \"And Lestat was calling out,\u0027Louis, wait for me; Louis, I must talk to you!\u0027 \"I could see Armand\u0027s rich, brown eye close to mine, and I felt weak all over and vaguely aware that Madeleine and Claudia were dead, his voice saying softly, perhaps soundlessly,\u0027I could not prevent it, I could not prevent it. . : And they were dead, simply dead. And I was losing consciousness. Santiago was near them somewhere there where they were still, that hair lifted on the wind, swept across those bricks, unraveling locks. But I was losing consciousness. \"I could not-gather their bodies up with me, could not take them out. Armand had his arm around my back, his hand under my arm, and he, was all but carrying me through some hollow wooden echoing place, and the smells of the street were rising, the fresh smell of the horses and the leather, and there were the gleaming carriages stopped there. And I could see myself clearly running down the Boulevard des Capucines with a small coffin under my arm and the people making way for me and dozens of people rising around the crowded tables of the open cafe and a man lifting his arm. It seemed I stumbled then, the Louis whom Armand held in his arm, and again I saw his brown eyes looking at me, and felt that drowsiness, that sinking. And yet I walked, I moved, I saw the gleam of my own boots on the pavement.\u0027Is he mad, that he says these things to me?\u0027 I was asking of Lestat, my voice shrill and angry, even the sound of it giving me some comfort. I was laughing, laughing loudly.\u0027He\u0027s stark-raving mad to speak to me in this manned Did you hear him?\u0027 I demanded. And Armand\u0027s eye said, Sleep. I wanted to say something about Madeleine and Claudia, that we could not leave them there, and I felt that cry again rising inside of me, that cry that pushed everything else out of its way, my teeth clenched to keep it in, because it was so loud and so full it would destroy me if I let it go. \"And then I conceived of everything too clearly. We were walking now, a belligerent, blind sort of walking that men do when they are wildly drunk and filled with hatred for others, while at the same time they feel invincible. I was walking in such a manner through New Orleans the night I\u0027d first encountered Lestat, that drunken walking which is a battering against things, which is miraculously sure-footed and finds its path. I saw a drunken man\u0027s hands fumbling miraculously with a match. Flame touched to the pipe, the smoke drawn in. I was standing at a cafe window. The man was drawing on his pipe. He was not at all drunk. Armand stood beside me waiting, and we were in the crowded Boulevard des Capucines. Or was it the Boulevard do Temple? I wasn\u0027t sure. I was outraged that their bodies remained there in that vile place. I saw Santiago\u0027s foot touching the blackened burned thing that had been my child! I was crying out through clenched teeth, and the man had risen from his table and steam spread out on the glass in front of his face.\u0027Get away from me,\u0027 I was saying to Armand.\u0027Damn you into hell, don\u0027t come near me. I warn you, don\u0027t come near me.\u0027 I was walking away from him up the boulevard, and I could see a man and a woman stepping aside for me, the man with his arm out to protect the woman. \"Then I was running. People saw me running. I wondered how it appeared to them, what wild, white thing they saw that moved too fast for their eyes. I remember that by the time I stopped, I was weak and sick, and my veins were burning as if I were starved. I thought of killing, and the thought filled me with revulsion. I was sitting on the stone steps beside a church, at one of those small side doors, carved into the stone, which was bolted and locked for the night. The rain had abated. Or so it seemed. And the street was dreary and quiet, though a man passed a long way off with a bright, black umbrella. Armand stood at a distance under the trees. Behind him it seemed there was a great expanse of trees and wet grasses and moist rising as if the ground were warm. \"By thinking of only one thing, the sickness in my stomach and head and the tightening in my throat, was I able to return to a state of calm. By the time these things had died away and I was feeling clear again, I was aware of all that had happened, the great distance we\u0027d come from the theater, and that the remains of Madeleine and Claudia were still there. Victims of a holocaust in each other\u0027s arms. And I felt resolute and very near to my own destruction. \"\u0027I could not prevent it,\u0027 Armand said softly to me. And I looked up to see his face unutterably sad. He looked away from me as if he felt it was futile to try to convince me of this, and I could feel his overwhelming sadness, his near defeat. I had the feeling that if I were to vent all my anger on him he would do little to resist me. And I could feel that detachment, that passivity in him as something pervasive which was at the root of what he insisted to me again,\u0027I could not have prevented it.\u0027 \"\u0027Oh, but you could have prevented it!\u0027 I said softly.\u0027You know full well that you could have. You were the leader! You were the only one who knew the limits of your own power. They didn\u0027t know. They didn\u0027t understand. Your understanding surpassed theirs.\u0027 \"He looked away still. But I could see the effect of my words on him. I could see the weariness in his face, the dull lusterless sadness of his eyes. \"\u0027You held sway over them. They feared you!\u0027 I went on.\u0027You could have stopped them if you\u0027d been willing to use that power even beyond your own selfprescribed limits. It was your sense of yourself you would not violate. Your own precious conception of truth! I understand you perfectly. I see in you the reflection of myself!\u0027 \"His eyes moved gently to engage mine. But he said nothing. The pain of his face was terrible. It was softened and desperate with pain and on the verge of some terrible explicit emotion he would not be able to control. He was in fear of that emotion. I was not. He was feeling my pain with that great spellbinding power of his which surpassed mine. I was not feeling his pain. It did not matter to me. \"\u0027I understand you only too well... \u0027 I said.\u0027That passivity in me has been the core of it all, the real evil. That weakness, that refusal to compromise a fractured and stupid morality, that awful pride! For that, I let myself become the thing I am, when I knew it was wrong. For that, I let Claudia become the vampire she became, when I knew it was wrong. For that, I stood by and let her kill Lestat, when 1 knew that was wrong, the very thing that was her undoing. I lifted not a finger to prevent it. And Madeleine, Madeleine, I let her come to that, when I should never have made her a creature like ourselves. I knew that was wrong! Well, I tell you I am no longer that passive, weak creature that has spun evil from evil till the web is vast and thick while I remain its stultified victim. It\u0027s over! I know now what I must do. And I warn you, for whatever mercy you\u0027ve shown me in digging me out of that grave tonight where I would have died: Do not seek your cell in the Theatre des Vampires again. Do not go near it.\"\u0027 \"I didn\u0027t wait to hear his answer. Perhaps he never attempted one. I don\u0027t know. I left him without looking back. If he followed me I was not conscious of it. I did not seek to know. I did not care. \"It was to the cemetery in Montmartre that I retreated. Why that place, I\u0027m not certain, except that it wasn\u0027t far from the Boulevard des Capucines, and Montmartre was countryfied then, and dark and peaceful compared to the metropolis. Wandering among the low houses with their kitchen gardens, I killed without the slightest measure of satisfaction, and then sought out the coffin where I was to lie by day in the cemetery. I scraped the remains out of it with my bare hands and lay down to a bed of foulness, of damp, of the stench of death. I cannot say this gave me comfort. Rather, it gave me what I wanted. Closeted in that dark, smelling the earth, away from all humans and all living human forms, I gave myself over to everything that invaded and stifled my senses. And, in so doing, gave myself over to my grief. \"But that was short.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/interview-with-the-vampire-the-vampire-chronicles-1/page-29.html","bookId":2209,"book":{"id":2209,"title":"Interview with the Vampire (The Vampire Chronicles #1)","description":"Storyline: Interview With The Vampire (The Vampire Chronicles #1) Here are the confessions of a vampire.
