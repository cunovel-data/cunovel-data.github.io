Would she have found some vault, like a mythical vampire, lying down with worms and ants by day and rising to haunt some small cemetery and its surroundings? But that\u0027s not why she didn\u0027t go. Something in her was as akin to me as anything in her could have been. That thing in Lestat was the same. We could not bear to live alone! We needed our little company! A wilderness of mortals surrounded us, groping, blind, preoccupied, and the brides and bridegrooms of death.\n \"\u0027Locked together in hatred,\u0027 she said to me calmly afterwards. I found her by the empty hearth, picking the small blossoms from a long stem of lavender. I was so relieved to see her there that I would have done anything, said anything. And when I heard her ask me in a low voice if I would tell her all I knew, I did this gladly. For all the rest was nothing compared to that old secret, that I had claimed her life. I told her of myself as I\u0027ve told you, of how Lestat came to me and what went on the night he carried her from the little hospital. She asked no questions and only occasionally looked up from her flowers. An then, when it was finished and I was sitting there, staring again at that wretched skull and listening to the soft slithering of the petals of the flowers on her dress and feeling a dull misery in my limbs and mind, she said to me,\u0027I don\u0027t despise you!\u0027 I wakened. She slipped off the high, rounded damask cushion an came towards me, covered with the scent of flower. the petals in her hand.\u0027Is this the aroma of mortal child?\u0027 she whispered.\u0027Louis. Lover.\u0027 I remember holding her and burying my head in her small chest, crushing her bird-shoulders, her small hands working into my hair, soothing me, holding me.\u0027I was mortal b you,\u0027 she said, and when I lifted my eyes I saw he smiling; but the softness on her lips was evanescent and in a moment she was looking past me like some one listening for faint, important music.\u0027You gave m your immortal kiss,\u0027 she said, though not to me, but to herself.\u0027You loved me with your vampire nature.\u0027\n \"\u0027I love you now with my human nature, if ever had it,\u0027 I said to her.\n \"\u0027Ah yes... \u0027 she answered, still musing.\u0027Yes, and that\u0027s your flaw, and why your face was miserable when I said as humans say, \"I hate you,\" and why you look at me as you do now. Human nature. I have no human nature. And no short story of a mother\u0027 corpse and hotel rooms where children learn monstrosity can give me one. I have none. Your eyes grow cold with fear when I say this to you. Yet I have you tongue. Your passion for the truth. Your need to drive the needle of the mind right to the heart of it all like the beak of the hummingbird, who beats so wild and fast that mortals might think he had no tiny feet could never set, just go from quest to quest, going again and again for the heart of it. I am your vampire self more than you are. And now the sleep of sixty five years has ended\u0027\n \"The sleep of sixty-five years hers ended! I heard he! say it, disbelieving, not wanting to believe she knee and meant precisely what she\u0027d said. For it had beer. exactly that since the night I tried to leave Lestat and failed and, falling in love with her, forgot my teeming brain, my awful questions. And now she had the awful questions on her lips and must know. She\u0027d strolled slowly to the center of the room and strewn the crumpled lavender all around her. She broke the brittle stem and touched it to her lips. And having heard the whole story said,\u0027He made me then... to be your companion. No chains could have held you in your loneliness, and he could give you nothing. He gives me nothing .... I used to think him charming. I liked the way he walked, the way he tapped the flagstones with his walking stick and swung me in his arms. And the abandon with which he killed, which was as I felt. But I no longer find him charming. And you never have. And we\u0027ve been his puppets, you and I; you remaining to take care of him, and I your saving companion. Now\u0027s time to end it, Louis. Now\u0027s time to leave him.\u0027\n \"Time to leave him.\n \"I hadn\u0027t thought of it, dreamed of it in so long; I\u0027d grown accustomed to him, as if he were a condition of life itself. I could hear a vague mingling of sounds now, which meant he had entered the carriage way, that he would soon be on the back stairs. And I thought of what I always felt when I heard him coming, a vague anxiety, a vague need. And then the thought of being free of him forever rushed over me like water I\u0027d forgotten, waves and waves of cool water. I was standing now, whispering to her that he was coming.\n \"\u0027I know,\u0027 she smiled.\u0027I heard him when he turned the far corner.\u0027\n \"\u0027But he\u0027ll never let us leave,\u0027 I whispered, though I\u0027d caught the implication of her words; her vampire sense was keen. She stood en garde magnificently.\u0027But you don\u0027t know him if you think he\u0027ll let us leave,\u0027 I said to her, alarmed at her self-confidence.\u0027He will not let us go.\u0027\n \"And she, still smiling, said,\u0027Oh... really?\"\u0027\n \"It was agreed then to make plans. At once. The following night my agent came with his usual complaints about doing business by the light of one wretched candle and took my explicit orders for an ocean crossing. Claudia and I would go to Europe, on the first available ship, regardless of what port we had to settle for. And paramount was that an important chest be shipped with us, a chest which might have to be fetched carefully from our house during the day and put on board, not in the freight but in our cabin. And then there were arrangements for Lestat. I had planned to leave him the rents for several shops and town houses and a small construction company operating in the Faubourg Marigny. I put my signature to these things readily. I wanted to buy our freedom: to convince Lestat we wanted only to take a. trip together and that he could remain in the style to which he was accustomed; he would have his own money and need come to me for nothing. For all these years, rd kept\u0027 dependent on me. Of course, he demanded his funds from me as if I were merely his banker, and thanked me with the most acrimonious words at his command; but he loathed his dependence. I hoped to deflect his suspicion by playing to his greed. And, convinced that he could read any emotion in my face, I was more than fearful. I did not believe it would be possible to escape him. Do you understand what that means? .I acted as though I believed it, but I did not.\n \"Claudia, meantime, was flirting with disaster, her equanimity overwhelming to me as she read her vampire books and asked Lestat questions. She remained undisturbed by his caustic outbursts, sometimes asking the same question over and over again in different ways and carefully considering what little information he might let escape in spite of himself.\u0027What vampire made you what you are?\u0027 she asked, without looking up from her book and keeping her lids lowered under his onslaught.\u0027Why do you never talk about him? she went on, as if his fierce objections were thin air. She seemed immune to his irritation.\n \" \u0027You\u0027re greedy, both of you!\u0027 he said the next night as he paced back and forth in the dark of the center of the room, turning a vengeful eye on Claudia, who was fitted into her corner, in the circle of her candle flame, her books in stacks about her.\u0027Immortality is not enough for you! No, you would look the Gift Horse of God in the mouth! I could offer it to any man out there in the street and he would jump for it...\"\n \"\u0027Did you jump for it?\u0027 she asked softly, her lips barely moving... but you, you would know the reason for it. Do you want to end it? I can give you death more easily than I gave you life!\u0027 He turned to me, her fragile flame throwing his shadow across me. It made a halo around his blond hair and left his face, except for the gleaming cheekbone, dark.\u0027Do you want death\u0027\n \"\u0027Consciousness is not death,\u0027 she whispered.\n \"\u0027Answer me\u0027 Do you want death!\u0027\n \"\u0027And you give all these things. They proceed from you. Life and death,\u0027 she whispered, mocking him.\n \"\u0027I have,\u0027 he said.\u0027I do.\u0027\n \"\u0027You know nothing,\u0027 she said to him gravely, her voice so low that the slightest noise from the street interrupted it, might carry her words away, so that I found myself straining to hear her against myself as I lay with my head back against the chair.\u0027And suppose the vampire who made you knew nothing, and the vampire who made that vampire knew nothing, and the vampire before him knew nothing, and so it goes back and back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.\u0027\n \"\u0027Yes!\u0027 he cried out suddenly, his hands out, his voice tinged with something other than anger.\n \"He was silent. She was silent. He turned, slowly, as if I\u0027d made some movement which alerted him, as if I were rising behind him. It reminded me of the way humans tam when they feel my breath against them and know suddenly that where they thought themselves to be utterly alone... that moment of awful suspicion before they see my face and gasp. He was looking at me now, and I could barely see his lips moving. And then I sensed it. He was afraid. Lestat afraid.\n \"And she was staring at him with the same level gaze, evincing no emotion, no thought.\n \"\u0027You infected her with this... \u0027 he whispered.\n \"He struck a match now with a sharp crackle and lit the mantel candles, lifted the smoky shades of the lamps, went around the room making light, until Claudia\u0027s small flame took on a solidity and he stood with his back to the marble mantel looking from light to light as if they restored some peace. \u0027I\u0027m going out,\u0027 he said.\n \"She rose the instant he had reached the street, and suddenly she stopped in the center of the room and stretched, her tiny back arched, her arms straight up into small fists, her eyes squeezed shut for a moment and then wide open as if she were waking to the room from a dream. There was something obscene about her gesture; the room seemed to shimmer with Lestat\u0027s fear, echo with his last response. It demanded her attention. I must have made some involuntary movement to turn away from her, because she was standing at the arm of my chair now and pressing her hand fiat upon my book, a book I hadn\u0027t been reading for hours. \u0027Come out with me.\u0027\n \"\u0027You were right. He knows nothing. There is nothing he can tell us,\u0027 I said to her.\n \"\u0027Did you ever really \u0026iexcl;\u0026#6132;hat he did?\u0027 she asked me in the same small voice.\u0027We\u0027ll find others of our kind,\u0027 she said.\u0027We\u0027ll find them in central Europe. That is where they live in such numbers that the stories, both fiction and fact, fill volumes. I\u0027m convinced it was from there that all vampires came, if they came from any place at all. We\u0027ve tarried too long with him. Come out. Let the flesh instruct the mind\u0027\n \"I think I felt a tremor of delight when she said these words, Let the flesh instruct the mind. \u0027Put books aside and kill,\u0027 she was whispering to me. I followed her down the stairs, across the courtyard and down a narrow alley to another street. Then she turned with outstretched arms for me to pick her up and carry her, though, of course, she was not tired; she wanted only to be rear my ear, to clutch my neck. \u0027I haven\u0027t told him my plan, about the voyage, the money,\u0027 I was saying to her, conscious of something about her that was beyond me as she rode my measured steps, weightless in my arms.\n \"\u0027He killed the other vampire,\u0027 she said.\n \"\u0027No, why do you say this?\u0027 I asked her. But it wasn\u0027t the saying of it that disturbed me, stirred my soul as if it were a pool of water longing to be -still. I felt as if she were moving me slowly towards something, as if she were the pilot of our slow walk through the dark street.\u0027Because I know it now,\u0027 she said with authority.\u0027The vampire made a slave of him, and he would no more be a slave than I would be a slave, and so he killed- him. Killed him before he knew what he might know, and then in panic made a slave of you. And you\u0027ve been his slave\u0027\n \"\u0027Never really... \u0027 I whispered to her. I felt the press of her cheek against my temple. She was cold and needed the kill.\u0027Not a slave. Just some sort of mindless accomplice,\u0027 I confessed to her, confessed to myself. I could feel the fever for the kill rising in me, a knot of hunger in my insides, a throbbing in the temples, as if the veins were contracting and my body might become a map of tortured vessels.\n \"\u0027No, slave,\u0027 she persisted in her grave monotone, as though thinking aloud, the words revelations, pieces of a puzzle.\u0027And I shall free us both.\u0027\n \"I stopped. Her hand pressed me, urged me on. We were walking down the long wide alley beside the cathedral, towards the lights of Jackson Square, the water rushing fast in the gutter down the center of the alley, silver in the moonlight. She said, \u0027I will kill him.\u0027\n \"I stood still at the end of the alley. I felt her shift in my arm, move down as if she could accomplish being free of me without the awkward aid of my hands. I set her on the stone sidewalk. I said no to her, I shook my head. I had that feeling then which I described before, that the building around me--the Cabildo, the cathedral, the apartments along the square-all this was silk and illusion and would ripple suddenly in a horrific wind, and a chasm would open in the earth that was the reality. \u0027Claudia,\u0027 I gasped, turning away from her.\n \"\u0027And why not kill him!\u0027 she said now, her voice rising, silvery and finally shrill.\u0027I have no use for him] I can get nothing from him! And he causes me pain, which I will not abide!\u0027\n \"\u0027And if he had so little use for us!\u0027 I said to her. But the vehemence was false. Hopeless. She was at a distance from me now, small shoulders straight and determined, her pace rapid, like a little girl who, walking out on Sundays with her parents, wants to walk ahead and pretend she is all alone.\u0027Claudia!\u0027 I called after her, catching up with her in a stride. I reached for the small waist and felt her stiffen as if she had become iron. \u0027Claudia, you cannot kill him!\u0027 I whispered. She moved backwards, skipping, clicking on the stones, and moved out into the open street. A cabriolet rolled past us with a sudden surge of laughter and the clatter of horses and wooden wheels. The street was suddenly silent. I reached out for her and moved forward over an immense space and found her standing at the gate of Jackson Square, hands gripping the wrought-iron bars. I drew down close to her.\u0027I don\u0027t care what you feel, what you say, you cannot mean to kill him,\u0027 I said to her.\n \"\u0027And why not? Do you think ham so strong!\u0027 she said, her eyes on the statue in the square, two immense pools of light.\n \"\u0027He is stronger than you know! Stronger than you dream! How do you mean to kill him? You can\u0027t measure his skill. You don\u0027t know!\u0027 I pleaded with her but could see her utterly unmoved, like a child staring in fascination through the window of a toy shop. Her tongue moved suddenly between her teeth and touched her lower lip in a strange flicker that sent a mild shock through my body. I tasted blood. I felt something palpable and helpless in my hands. I wanted to kill. I could smell and hear humans on the paths of the square, moving about the market, along the levee. I was about to take her, making her look at me, shake her if I had to, to make her listen, when she turned to me with her great liquid eyes.\u0027I love you, Louis,\u0027 she said.\n `Then listen to me, Claudia, I beg you,\u0027 I whispered, holding her, pricked suddenly by a nearby collection of whispers, the slow, rising articulation of human speech over the mingled sounds of the night.\u0027He\u0027ll destroy you if you try to kill him. There is no way you can do such a thing for sure. You don\u0027t know how. And pitting yourself against him you\u0027ll lose everything. Claudia, I can\u0027t bear this.\u0027\n \"There was a barely perceptible smile on her lips.\u0027No, Louis,\u0027 she whispered.\u0027I can kill him. And I want to tell you something else now, a secret between you and me.\u0027\n \"I shook my head but she pressed even closer to me, lowering her lids so that her rich lashes almost brushed the roundness of her cheeks.\u0027The secret is, Louis, that I want to kill him. I will enjoy it!\u0027\n \"I knelt beside her, speechless, her eyes studying me as they\u0027d done so often in the past; and then she said,\u0027I kill humans every night. I seduce them, draw them close to me, with an insatiable hunger, a constant never-ending search for something... something, I don\u0027t know what it is... : She brought her fingers to her lips now and pressed her lips, her mouth partly open so I could see the gleam of her teeth.\u0027And I care nothing about them-where they came from, where they would go-if I did not meet them on the way. But I dislike him! I want him dead and will have him dead. I shall enjoy it.\u0027\n \"\u0027But Claudia, he is not mortal. He\u0027s immortal. No illness can touch him. Age has no power over him. You threaten a life which might endure to the end of the world!\u0027\n \"\u0027Ah, yes, that\u0027s it, precisely!\u0027 she said with reverential awe.\u0027A lifetime that might have endured for centuries. Such blood, such power. Do you think I\u0027ll possess his power and my own power when I take him\u0027\u0027\n \"I was enraged now. I rose suddenly and turned away from her. I could hear the whispering of humans near me. They were whispering of the father and the daughter, of some frequent sight of loving devotion. I realized they were talking of us.\n \"\u0027It\u0027s not necessary,\u0027 I said to her.\u0027It goes beyond all need, all common sense, all...\n \"\u0027What\u0027 Humanity? He\u0027s a killer!\u0027 she hissed.\u0027Lone predator!\u0027 She repeated his own term, mocking it.\u0027Don\u0027t interfere with me or seek to know the time I choose to do it, nor try to come between us. .\n She raised her hand now to hush me and caught mine in an iron grasp, her tiny fingers biting into my tight, tortured flesh.\u0027If you do, you will bring me destruction by your interference. I can\u0027t be discouraged.\u0027\n \"She was gone then in a flurry of bonnet ribbons and clicking slippers. I turned, paying no attention to where I went, wishing the city would swallow me, conscious now of the hunger rising to overtake reason. I was almost loath to put an end to it. I needed to let the lust, the excitement blot out all consciousness, and I thought of the kill over and over and over, walking slowly up this street and down the next, moving inexorably towards it, saying, It\u0027s a string which is pulling me through the labyrinth. I am not pulling the string. The string is pulling me... And then I stood in the Rue Conti listening to a dull thundering, a familiar sound. It was the fencers above in the salon, advancing on the hollow wooden floor, forward, back again, scuttling, and the silver zinging of the foils. I stood back against the wall, where I could see them through the high naked windows, the young men dueling late into the night, left ,arm poised like the arm of a dancer, grace advancing towards death, grace thrusting for the heart, images of the young Freniere now driving the silver blade forward, now being pulled by it towards hell. Someone had come down the narrow wooden steps to the street-a young boy, a boy so young he had the smooth, plump cheeks of a child; his face was pink and flushed from the fencing, and beneath his smart gray coat and ruffled shirt there was the sweet smell of cologne and salt. I could feel his heat as he emerged from the dim light of the stairwell. He was laughing to himself, talking almost inaudibly to himself, his brown hair falling down over his eyes as he went along, shaking his head, the whispers rising, then falling off. And then he stopped short, his eyes on me. He stared, and his eyelids quivered and he laughed quickly, nervously.\u0027Excuse me!\u0027 he said now in French.\u0027You gave me a start!\u0027 And then, just as he moved to make a ceremonial bow and perhaps go around me, he stood still, and the shock spread over his flushed face. I could see the heart beating in the pink flesh of his cheeks, smell the sudden sweat of his young, taut body.\n \"\u0027You saw-me in the lamplight,\u0027 I said to him.\u0027And my face looked to you like the mask of death.\u0027\n \"His lips parted and his teeth touched and involuntarily he nodded, his eyes dazed.\n \"\u0027Pass by!\u0027 I said to him.\u0027Fast!\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/interview-with-the-vampire-the-vampire-chronicles-1/page-11.html","bookId":2209,"book":{"id":2209,"title":"Interview with the Vampire (The Vampire Chronicles #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Interview With The Vampire (The Vampire Chronicles #1) \n Here are the confessions of a vampire.
