This was the first time since he had come for me that he had looked away from me, and I found myself looking at him unwatched. For a long time he sat in this manner and I could all but feel his thoughts, as if they were palpable in the air like smoke. Not read them, you understand, but feel the power of them. It seemed he possessed an aura and even though his face was very young, which I knew meant nothing, he appeared infinitely old, wise. I could not define it, because I could not explain how the youthful lines of his face, how his eyes expressed innocence and this age and experience at the same time.\\n\\n \"He rose now and looked at Claudia, his hands loosely clasped behind his back. Her silence all this time had been understandable to me. These were not her questions, yet she was fascinated with him and was waiting for him and no doubt learning from him all the while that he spoke to me. But I understood something else now as they looked at each other. He had moved to his feet with a body totally at his command, devoid of the habit of human gesture, gesture rooted in necessity, ritual, fluctuation of mind; and his stillness now was unearthly. And she, as I\u0027d never seen before, possessed the same stillness. And they were gazing at each other with a preternatural understanding from which I was simply excluded.\\n\\n \"I was something whirling and vibrating to them, as mortals were to me. And I knew when he turned towards me again that he\u0027d come to understand she did not believe or share my concept of evil.\\n\\n \"His speech commenced without the slightest warning.\u0027This is the only real evil left,\u0027 he said to the flames.\\n\\n \"\u0027Yes,\u0027 I answered, feeling that all-consuming subject alive again, obliterating all concerns as it always had for me.\\n\\n \"\u0027It\u0027s true,\u0027 he said, shocking me, deepening my sadness, my despair.\\n\\n \"\u0027Then God does not exist... you have no knowledge of His existence?\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027None,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \"\u0027No knowledge!\u0027 I said it again, unafraid of my simplicity, my miserable human pain.\\n\\n \"\u0027None.\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027And no vampire here has discourse with God or with the devil!\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027No vampire that I\u0027ve ever known,\u0027 he said, musing, the fire dancing in his eyes.\u0027And as far as I know today, after four hundred years, I am the oldest living vampire in the world.\u0027\\n\\n \"I stared at him, astonished.\\n\\n \"Then it began to sink in. It was as I\u0027d always feared, and it was as lonely, it was as totally without hope. Things would go on as they had before, on and on. My search was over. I sat back listlessly watching those licking flames.\\n\\n \"It was futile to leave him to continue it, futile to travel the world only to hear again the same story.\u0027Four hundred years\u0027-I think I repeated the words\u0027four hundred years.\u0027 I remember staring at the fire. There was a log falling very slowly in the fire, drifting downwards in a process that would take it the night, and it was pitted with tiny holes where some substance that had larded it through and through had burned away fast, and in each of these tiny holes there danced a flame amid the larger flames: and all of these tiny flames with their black mouths seemed to me faces that made a chorus; and the chorus sang without singing. The chorus had no need of singing; in one breath in the fire, which was continuous, it made its soundless song.\\n\\n \"All at once Armand moved in a loud rustling of garments, a descent of crackling shadow and light that left him kneeling at my feet, his hands outstretched holding my head, his eyes burning.\\n\\n \"\u0027This evil, this concept, it comes from disappointment, from bitterness! Don\u0027t you see? Children of Satan! Children of God! Is this the only question you bring to me, is this the only power that obsesses you, so that you must make us gods and devils yourself when the only power that exists is inside ourselves? How could you believe in these old fantastical lies, these myths, these emblems of the supernatural?\u0027 He snatched the devil from above Claudia\u0027s still countenance so swiftly that I couldn\u0027t see the gesture, only the demon leering before me and then crackling in the flames.\\n\\n \"Something was broken inside me when he said this; something ripped aside, so that a torrent of feeling became one with my muscles in every limb. I was on my feet now, backing away from him.\\n\\n \"\u0027Are you mad?\u0027 I asked, astonished at my own anger, my own despair.\u0027We stand here, the two of us, immortal, ageless, rising nightly to feed that immortality on human blood; and there on your desk against the knowledge of the ages sits a flawless child as demonic as ourselves; and you ask me how I could believe I would find a meaning in the supernatural! I tell you, after seeing what I have become, I could damn well believe anything! Couldn\u0027t you? And believing thus, being thus confounded, I can now accept the most fantastical truth of all: that there is no meaning to any of this!\u0027\\n\\n \"I backed towards the door, away from his astonished face, his hand hovering before his lips, the finger curling to dig into his palm.\u0027Don\u0027t! Come back... : he whispered.\\n\\n \"\u0027No, not now. Let me go. Just a while... let me go.... Nothing\u0027s changed; it\u0027s all the same. Let that sink into me... just let me go.\u0027\\n\\n \"I looked back before I shut the door. Claudia\u0027s face was turned towards me, though she sat as before, her hands clasped on her knee. She made a gesture then, subtle as her smile, which was tinged with the faintest sadness, that I was to go on.\\n\\n \"It was my desire to escape the theater then entirely, to find the streets of Paris and wander, letting the vast accumulation of shocks gradually wear away. But, as I groped along the stone passage of the lower cellar, I became confused. I was perhaps incapable of exerting my own will. It seemed more than ever absurd to me that Lestat should have died, if in fact he had; and looking back on him, as it seemed I was always doing, I saw him more kindly than before. Lost like the rest of us. Not the jealous protector of any knowledge he was afraid to share. He -knew nothing. There was nothing to know.\\n\\n \"Only, that was not quite the thought that was gradually coming clear to me. I had hated him for all the wrong reasons; yes, that was true. But I did not fully understand it yet. Confounded, I found myself sitting finally on those dark steps, the light from the ballroom throwing my own shadow on the rough floor, my hands holding my head, a weariness overcoming me. My mind said, Sleep. But more profoundly, my mind said, Bream. And yet I made no move to return to the Hotel Saint-Gabriel, which seemed a very secure and airy place to me now, a place of subtle and luxurious mortal consolation where I might lie in a chair of puce velvet, put one foot on an ottoman and watch the fire lick the marble tile, looking for all the world to myself in the long mirrors like a thoughtful human. Flee to that, I thought, flee all that is pulling you. And again came that thought: I have wronged Lestat, I have hated him for all the wrong reasons. I whispered it now, trying to withdraw it from the dark, inarticulate pool of my mind, and the whispering made a scratching sound in the stone vault of the stairs.\\n\\n \"But then a voice came softly to me on the air, too faint for mortals:\u0027How is this so? How did you wrong him?\u0027\\n\\n \"I turned round so sharp that my breath left me. A vampire sat near me, so near as to almost brush my shoulder with the tip of his boot, his legs drawn up close to him, his hands clasped around them. For -a moment I thought my eyes deceived me. It was the trickster vampire, whom Armand had called Santiago.\\n\\n \"Yet nothing in his manner indicated his former self, that devilish, hateful self that I had seen, even only a few hours ago when he had reached out for me and Armand had struck him. He was staring at me over his drawn-up knees, his hair disheveled, his mouth slack and without cunning.\\n\\n \"\u0027It makes no difference to anyone else,\u0027 I said to him, the fear in me subsiding.\\n\\n \"\u0027But you said a name; I heard you say a name,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \" \u0027A name I don\u0027t want to say again,\u0027 I answered, looking away from him. I could see now how he\u0027d fooled me, why his shadow had not fallen over mine; he crouched in my shadow. The vision of him slithering down those stone stairs to sit behind me was slightly disturbing. Everything about him was disturbing, and\\n\\n I reminded myself that he could in no way be trusted. It seemed to me then that Armand, with his hypnotic power, aimed in some way for the maximum truth in presentation of himself: he lead drawn out of me without words my state of mind. But this vampire was a liar. And I could feel his power, a crude, pounding power that was almost as strong as Arm,-,P-Xs.\\n\\n \"\u0027You come to Paris in search of us, and then you sit alone on. the stairs... : he said, in a conciliatory tone.\u0027Why don\u0027t you come up with us? Why don\u0027t you speak to us and talk to us of this person whose name you spoke; I know who it was, I know the name.\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027You don\u0027t know, couldn\u0027t know. It was a mortal,\u0027 I said now, more front instinct than conviction. Time thought of Lestat disturbed me, the thought that this creature should know of Lestat\u0027s death.\\n\\n \"\u0027You care here to ponder mortals, justice done to mortals?\u0027 he asked; but there was no reproach or mockery in his tone.\\n\\n \"\u0027I came to be alone, let me not offend you. It\u0027s a fact,\u0027 I murmured.\\n\\n \"\u0027But alone in this frame of mind, when you don\u0027t even hear my steps.... I like you. I want you to come upstairs\u0027 And as he said this, he slowly pulled me to my feet beside him.\\n\\n \"At that moment the door of Armand\u0027s cell threw a long light into the passage. I heard him conning, and Santiago let me go. I was standing there baffled. Armand appeared at the foot of the steps, with Claudia in lids arms. She had that same dull expression on her face which she\u0027d had all during my talk with Armand. It was as if she were deep in her own considerations and saw nothing around her; and I remember noting this, though not knowing what to think of it, that it persisted even now. I took her quickly from Armand, and felt her soft limbs against me as if we were both in. the coffin, yielding to that paralytic sleep.\\n\\n \"And then, with a powerful thrust of his arm, Armand pushed Santiago away. It seemed he fell backwards, but was up again only to have Armand gull him towards the head of the steps, all of this happening so swiftly I could only see the blur of their garments and hear the scratching of their boots. Then Armand stood alone at the head of the steps, and I went upward towards him.\\n\\n \" \u0027You cannot safely leave the theater tonight,\u0027 he whispered to me. \u0027He is suspicious of you. And my having brought you here, he feels that it is his right to know you better. Our security depends on it.\u0027 He guided me slowly into the ballroom. But then he turned to me and pressed his lips almost to my ear:\u0027I must warn you. Answer no questions. Ask and you open one bud of truth for yourself after another. But give nothing, nothing, especially concerning your origin.\u0027\\n\\n \"He moved away from us now, but beckoning for us to follow \u0027 into the gloom where the others were gathered, clustered like remote marble statues, their faces and hands all too like our own. I had the strong sense then of how we were all made from the same material, a thought which had only occurred to me occasionally in all the long years in New Orleans; and it disturbed me, particularly when I saw one or more of the others reflected in the long mirrors that broke the density of those awful murals.\\n\\n \"Claudia seemed to awaken as I found one of the carved oak chairs and settled into it. She leaned towards me and said something strangely incoherent, which seemed to mean that I must do as Armand said: say nothing of our origin. I wanted to talk with her now, but I could see that tall vampire, Santiago, watching us, his eyes moving slowly from us to Armand. Several women vampires had gathered around Armand, and I felt a tumult of feeling as I saw them put their arms around his waist. And what appalled me as I watched was not their exquisite form, their delicate features and graceful hands made hard as glass by vampire nature, or their bewitching eyes which fixed on me now in a sudden silence; what appalled me was my own fierce jealousy. I was afraid when I saw them so close to him, afraid when he turned and kissed them each. And, as he brought them near to me now, I was unsure and confused.\\n\\n \"Estelle and Celeste are the names I remember, porcelain beauties, who fondled Claudia with the license of the blind, running their hands over her radiant hair, touching even her lips, while she, her eyes still misty and distant, tolerated it all, knowing what I also knew and what they seemed unable to grasp: that a woman\u0027s mind as sharp and distinct as their own lived within that small body. It made me wonder as I watched her turning about for them, holding out her lavender skirts and smiling coldly at their adoration, how many times I must have forgotten, spoken to her as if she were the child, fondled her too freely, brought her into my arms with an adult\u0027s abandon. My mind went in three directions: that last night in the Hotel Saint-Gabriel, which seemed a year ago, when she talked of love with rancor; my reverberating shock at Armand\u0027s revelations or lack of them; and a quiet absorption of the vampires around me, who whispered in the dark beneath the grotesque murals. For I could learn much from the vampires without ever asking a question, and vampire life in Paris was all that I\u0027d feared it to be, all that the little stage in the theater above had indicated it was.\\n\\n \"\u0027The dim lights of the house were mandatory, and the paintings appreciated in full, added to almost nightly when some vampire brought a new engraving or picture by a contemporary artist into the house. Celeste, with her cold hand on my arm, spoke with contempt of men as the originators of these pictures, and Estelle, who now held Claudia on her lap, emphasized to me, the naive colonial, that vampires had not made such horrors themselves but merely collected them, confirming over and over that men were capable of far greater evil than vampires.\\n\\n \"\u0027There is evil in making such paintings?\u0027 Claudia asked softly in her toneless voice.\\n\\n \"Celeste threw back her black curls and laughed.\\n\\n \"\u0027What can be imagined can be done,\u0027 slue answered quickly, but her eyes reflected a certain contained hostility.\u0027Of course, we strive to rival men in kills of all kinds, do we riot!~ Sloe leaned forward arid touched Claudia\u0027s knee. But Claudia merely looked at her, watching her laugh nervously and continue. Santiago drew near, to bring up the subject of our rooms in the Hotel Saint-Gabriel; frightfully unsafe, he said, with an exaggerated stage gesture of the hands. And he showed a knowledge of those rooms which was amazing. He knew the chest in which we slept; it struck him as vulgar.\u0027Come here!\u0027 he said to me, with that near childlike simplicity he had evinced on the steps.\u0027Live with us and such disguise is unnecessary. We have our guards. And tell me, where do you come from!\u0027 he said, dropping to his knees, his hand on the arm of my chair.\u0027Your voice, I know that accent; speak again.\u0027\\n\\n \"I was vaguely horrified at the thought of having an accent to my French, but this wasn\u0027t my immediate concern. He was strong-willed and blatantly possessive, throwing back at me an image of that possessiveness which was flowering in me more fully every moment. And meanwhile, the vampires around us talked on, Estelle explaining that black was the color for a vampire\u0027s clothes, that Claudia\u0027s lovely pastel dress was beautiful but tasteless.\u0027We blend with the night,\u0027 she said.\u0027We have a funereal gleam.\u0027 And now, bending her cheek next to Claudia\u0027s cheek, she laughed to soften her criticism; and Celeste laughed, and Santiago laughed, and the whole room seemed alive with unearthly tinkling laughter, preternatural voices echoing against the painted walls, rippling the feeble candle flames.\u0027Ah, but to cover up such curls,\u0027 said Celeste, now playing with Claudia\u0027s golden hair. And I realized what must have been obvious: that all of them had dyed their hair black, but for Armand; and it was that, along with the black clothes, that added to the disturbing impression that we were statues from the same chisel and paint brush. I cannot emphasize too much how disturbed I was by that impression. It seemed to stir something in me deep inside, something I couldn\u0027t fully grasp.\\n\\n \"I found myself wandering away from them to one of the narrow mirrors and watching them all over my shoulder. Claudia gleamed like a jewel in their midst; so would that mortal boy who slept below. The realization was coming to me that I found them dull in some awful way: dull, dull everywhere that I looked, their sparkling vampire eyes repetitious, their wit like a dull, brass bell.\\n\\n \"Only the knowledge I needed distracted me from these thoughts.\u0027The vampires of eastern Europe...\\n\\n Claudia was saying.\u0027Monstrous creatures, what have they to do with us?\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027Revenants,\u0027 Armand answered softly over the distance that separated them, playing on faultless preternatural ears to hear what was more muted than a whisper. The room fell silent.\u0027Their blood is different, vile. They increase as we do but without skill or care. In the old days-\u0027 Abruptly he stopped. I could see his face in the mirror. It was strangely rigid.\\n\\n \"\u0027Oh, but tell us about the old days,\u0027 said Celeste, her voice shrill, at human pitch. There was something vicious in her tone. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/interview-with-the-vampire-the-vampire-chronicles-1/page-22.html","bookId":2209,"book":{"id":2209,"title":"Interview with the Vampire (The Vampire Chronicles #1)","description":"Storyline: Interview With The Vampire (The Vampire Chronicles #1) \\n Here are the confessions of a vampire.
