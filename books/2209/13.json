So now let\u0027s have peace, because there\u0027s nothing else to be had. I have a present for you.\u0027 \"\u0027And I hope it\u0027s a beautiful woman with endowments you\u0027ll never possess;\u0027 he said, looking her up and down. Her face changed when he did this. It was as if she almost lost some control I\u0027d never seen her lose. But then she just shook her head and reached out one small, rounded arm and tugged at his sleeve. \"\u0027I meant what I said. I\u0027m weary of arguing with you. Hell is hatred, people living together in eternal hatred. We\u0027re not in hell. You can take the present or not, I don\u0027t care. It doesn\u0027t matter. Only let\u0027s have an end to all this. Before Louis, in disgust, leaves us both.\u0027 She was urging him now to leave the piano, bringing down the wooden cover again over the keys, turning him on the piano stool until his eyes followed her to the door. \"\u0027You\u0027re serious. Present, what do you mean, present?\u0027 \"\u0027You haven\u0027t fed enough, I can tell by your color, by your eyes. You\u0027ve never fed enough at this hour. Let\u0027s say that I can give you a precious moment. Suffer the little children to come unto me;\u0027 she whispered, and was gone. He looked at me. I said nothing. I night as well have been drugged. I could see the curiosity in his face, the suspicion. He followed her down the hall. And then I heard him let out a long, conscious moan, a perfect mingling of hunger and lust\u0027 \"When I reached the door, and I took my time, he was bending over the settee. Two small boys lay there, nestled among the soft velvet pillows, totally abandoned to sleep as children can be, their pink mouths open, their small round faces utterly smooth. Their skin was moist, radiant, the curls of the darker of the two damp and pressed to the forehead. I saw at once by their pitiful and identical clothes that they were orphans. And they had ravaged a meal set before them on our best china. The tablecloth was stained with wine, and a small bottle stood half full among the greasy plates and forks. But there was an aroma in the room I did not like. I moved closer, better to see the sleeping ones, and I could see their throats were bare but untouched. Lestat had sunk down beside the darker one; he was by far the more beautiful. He might have been lifted to the painted dome of a cathedral. No more than seven years old, he had that perfect beauty that is of neither sex, but angelic. Lestat brought his hand down gently on the pale throat, and then he touched the silken lips. He let out a sigh which had again that longing, that sweet, painful anticipation.\u0027Oh... Claudia... : he sighed.\u0027You\u0027ve outdone yourself. Where did you find them?\u0027 \"She said nothing. She had receded to a dark armchair and sat back against two large pillows, her legs out straight on the rounded cushion, her ankles drooping so that you did not see the bottom of her white slippers but the curved insteps and the tight, delicate little straps. She was staring at Lestat.\u0027Drunk on brandy wine,\u0027 she said.\u0027A thimbleful!\u0027 and gestured to the table. \u0027I thought of you when I saw them... I thought if I share this with him, even he will forgive.\u0027 \"He was warmed by her flattery. He looked at her now and reached out and clutched her white lace ankle.\u0027Ducky!\u0027 he whispered to, her and laughed, but then he hushed, as if he didn\u0027t wish to wake the doomed children. He gestured to her, intimately, seductively,\u0027Come sit beside him. You take him, and I\u0027ll take this one. Come.\u0027 He embraced her as she passed and nestled beside the other boy. He stroked the boy\u0027s moist hair, he ran his fingers over the rounded lids and along the fringe of lashes. And then he put his whole softened hand across the boy\u0027s face and felt at the temples, cheeks, and jaw, massaging the unblemished flesh. He had forgotten I was there or she was there, but he withdrew his hand and sat still for a moment, as though his desire was making him dizzy. He glanced at the ceiling and then down at the perfect feast. He turned the boy\u0027s head slowly against the back of the couch, and the boy\u0027s eyebrows tensed for an instant and a moan escaped his lips. \"Claudia\u0027s eyes were steady on Lestat, though now she raised her left hand and slowly undid the buttons of the child who lay beside her and reached inside the shabby little shirt and felt the bare flesh. Lestat did the same, but suddenly it was as if his hand had life itself and drew his arm into the shirt and around the boy\u0027s small chest in a. tight embrace; and Lestat slid down off the cushions of the couch to his knees on the floor. his arm locked to the boy\u0027s body. Pulling it up close to him so that his face was buried in the boy\u0027s neck. His lips moved over the neck and over the chest and over the tiny nipple of the chest and then, putting his other arm into the open shirt, so that the boy lay hopelessly wound in both arms, he drew the boy up tight and sank his teeth into his throat. The boy\u0027s head fell back, the curls loose as he was lifted, and again he let out a small moan and his eyelids fluttered-but never opened. And Lestat knelt, the boy pressed against him, sucking hard, his own back arched and rigid, his body rocking back and forth carrying the boy, his long moans rising and falling in time with the slow rocking, until suddenly his whole body tensed, and his hands seemed to grope for some way to push the boy away, as if the boy himself in his helpless slumber were clinging to Lestat; and finally he embraced the boy again and moved slowly forward over him, letting him down among the pillows, the sucking softer, now almost inaudible. \"He withdrew. His hands pressed the boy down. He knelt there, his head thrown back, so the wavy blond hair bung loose and disheveled. And then he slowly sank to the floor, turning, his back against the leg of the couch.\u0027Ah... God... : he whispered, his head back, his lids half-mast. I could see the color rushing to his cheeks, rushing into his hands. One hand lay on his bent knee, fluttering, and then it lay still. \"Claudia had not moved. She lay like a Botticelli angel beside the unharmed boy. The other\u0027s body already withered, the neck like a fractured stem, the heavy head falling now at an odd angle, the angle of death, into the pillow. \"But something was wrong. Lestat was staring at the ceiling. I could see his tongue between his teeth. He lay too still, the tongue, as it were, trying to get out of the mouth, trying to move past the barrier of the teeth and touch the lip. He appeared to shiver, his shoulders convulsing... then relaxing heavily; yet he did not move. A veil had fallen over his clear gray eyes. He was peering at the ceiling. Then a sound came out of him. I stepped forward from the shadows of the hallway, but Claudia said in a sharp hiss,\u0027Go back!\u0027 \"\u0027Louis... : he was saying. I could hear it now...\u0027Louis... Louis....\u0027 \"\u0027Don\u0027t you like it, Lestat?\u0027 she asked him. \"\u0027Something\u0027s wrong with it,\u0027 he gasped, and his eyes widened as if the mere speaking were a colossal effort. He could not move. I saw it. He could not move at all.\u0027Claudia!\u0027 He gasped again, and his eyes rolled towards her. \"\u0027Don\u0027t you like the taste of children\u0027s blood... ?\u0027 she asked softly. \"\u0027Louis... : he whispered, finally lifting his head just for an instant. It fell back on the couch.\u0027Louis, it\u0027s... it\u0027s absinthe! Too much absinthe!\u0027 he gasped.\u0027She\u0027s poisoned them with it. She\u0027s poisoned me. Louis.... : He tried to raise his hand. I drew nearer, the table between us. \"\u0027Stay back!\u0027 she said again. And now she slid off the couch and approached him, peering down into his face as he had peered at the child.\u0027Absinthe, Father,\u0027 she said,\u0027and laudanum!\u0027 \"\u0027Demon!\u0027 he said to her.\u0027Louis... put me in my coffin.\u0027 He struggled to rise.\u0027Put me in my coffin!\u0027 His voice was hoarse, barely audible. The hand fluttered, lifted, and fell back. \" \u0027I\u0027ll put you in your coffin, Father,\u0027 she said, as though she were soothing him.\u0027I\u0027ll put you in it forever.\u0027 And then, from beneath the pillows of the couch, she drew a kitchen knife. \" \u0027Claudia! Don\u0027t do this thing!\u0027 I said to her. But she flashed at me a virulency I\u0027d never seen in her face, and as I stood there paralyzed, she gashed his throat, and he let out a sharp, choking cry.\u0027God!\u0027 he shouted out.\u0027God!\u0027 \"The blood poured out of him, down his shirt front, down his coat. It poured as it might never pour from a human being, all the blood with which he had filled himself before the child and from the child; and he kept turning his head, twisting, making the bubbling gash gape. She sank the knife into his chest now and he pitched forward, his mouth wide, his fangs exposed, both hands convulsively flying towards the knife, fluttering around its handle, slipping off its handle. He looked up at me, the hair falling down into his eyes.\u0027Louis! Louis!\u0027 He let out one more gasp and fell sideways on the carpet. She stood looking down at him. The blood flowed everywhere like water. He was groaning, trying to raise himself, one arm pinned beneath his chest, the other shoving at the floor. And now, suddenly, she flew at him and clamping both arms about his neck, bit deep into him as he struggled.\u0027Louis, Louis!\u0027 he gasped over and over, struggling, trying desperately to throw her off; but she rode him, her body lifted by his shoulder, hoisted and dropped, hoisted and dropped, until she pulled away; and, finding the floor quickly, she backed away from him, her hands to her lips, her eyes for the moment clouded, then clear. I turned away from her, my body convulsed by what I\u0027d seen, unable to look any longer.\u0027Louis!\u0027 she said; but I only shook my head. For a moment, the whole house seemed to sway. But she said,\u0027Look what\u0027s happening to him!\u0027 \"He had ceased to move. He lay now on his back. And his entire body was shriveling, drying up, the skin thick and wrinkled, and so white that all the tiny veins showed through it. I gasped, but I could not take my eyes off it, even as the shape of the bones began to show through, his lips drawing back from his teeth, the flesh of his nose drying to two gaping holes. But his eyes, they remained the same, staring wildly at the ceiling, the irises dancing from side to side, even as the flesh cleaved to the bones, became nothing but a parchment wrapping for the bones, the clothes hollow and limp over the skeleton that remained. Finally the irises rolled to the top of his head, and the whites of his eyes went dim. The thing lay still. A great mass of wavy blond hair, a coat, a pair of gleaming boots; and this horror that had been Lestat, and I staring helplessly at it.\" \"For a long time, Claudia merely stood there. Blood had soaked the carpet, darkening the woven wreaths of flowers. It gleamed sticky and black on the floorboards. It stained her dress, her white shoes, her cheek. She wiped at it with a crumpled napkin, took a swipe at the impossible stains of the dress, and then she said,\u0027Louis, you must help me get him out of here!\u0027 \"I said,\u0027Not\u0027 I\u0027d turned my back on her, on the corpse at her feet. \"\u0027Are you mad, Louis? It can\u0027t remain here!\u0027 she said to me.\u0027And the boys. You must help met The other one\u0027s dead from the absinthe! Louis!\u0027 \"I knew that this was true, necessary; and yet it seemed impossible. \"She had to prod me then, almost lead me every step of the way. We found the kitchen stove still heaped with the bones of the mother and daughter she\u0027d killed-a dangerous blunder, a stupidity. So she scraped them out now into a sack and dragged the sack across the courtyard stones to the carriage. I hitched the horse myself, shushing the groggy coachman, and drove the hearse out of the city, fast in the direction of the Bayou St. Jean, towards the dark swamp that stretched to Lake Pontchartrain. She sat beside me, silent, as we rode on and on until we\u0027d passed the gas-lit gates of the few country houses, and the shell road narrowed and became rutted, the swamp rising on either side of us, a great wall of seemingly impenetrable cypress and vine. I could smell the stench of the muck, hear the rustling of the animals. \"Claudia had wrapped Lestat\u0027s, body in a sheet before I would even touch it, and then, to my horror, she had sprinkled it over with the long-stemmed chrysanthemums. So it had a sweet, funereal smell as I lifted it last of all from the carriage. It was almost weightless, as limp as something made of knots and cords, as I put it over my shoulder and moved down into the dark water, the water rising and filling my boots, my feet seeking some path in the ooze beneath, away from where I\u0027d laid the two boys. I went deeper and deeper in with Lestat\u0027s remains, though why, I did not know. And finally, when I could barely see the pale space of the road and the sky which was coming dangerously close to dawn, I let his body slip down out of my arms into the water. I stood there shaken, looking at the amorphous form of the white sheet beneath the slimy surface. The numbness which had protected me since the carriage left the Rue Royale threatened to lift and leave me flayed suddenly, staring, thinking: This is Lestat. This is all of transformation and mystery, dead, gone into eternal darkness. I felt a pull suddenly, as if some force were urging me to go down with him, to descend into the dark water and never come back. It was so distinct and so strong that it made the articulation of voices seem only a murmur by comparison. It spoke without language, saying,\u0027You know what you must do. Come down into the darkness. Let it all go away.\u0027 \"But at that moment I heard Claudia\u0027s voice. She was calling my name. I turned, and, through the tangled vines, I saw her distant and tiny, like a white flame on the faint luminescent shell road. \"That morning, she wound her arms around me, pressed her head against my chest in the closeness of the coffin, whispering she loved me, that we were free now of Lestat forever.\u0027I love you, Louis,\u0027 she said over and over as the darkness finally came down with the lid and mercifully blotted out all consciousness. \"When I awoke, she was going through his things. It was a tirade, silent, controlled, but filled with a fierce anger. She pulled the contents from cabinets, emptied drawers onto the carpets, pulled one jacket after another from his armoires, turning the pockets inside out, throwing the coins and theater tickets and bits and pieces of paper away. I stood in the. door of his room, astonished, watching her. His coffin lay there, heaped with scarves and pieces of tapestry. I had the compulsion to open it. I had the wish to see him there.\u0027Nothing!\u0027 she finally said in disgust. .She wadded the clothes into the grate.\u0027Not a hint of where he came from, who made him!\u0027 she said.\u0027Not a scrap\u0027 She looked to me as if for sympathy. I turned away from her. I was unable to look at her. I moved back into that bedroom which I kept for myself, that room filled with my own books and what things I\u0027d saved from my mother and sister, and I sat on .the bed. I could hear her at the door, but I would not look at her.\u0027He deserved to die!\u0027 she said to me. \"\u0027Then we deserve to die. The same way. Every night of our lives,\u0027 I said back to her.\u0027Go away from me.\u0027 It was as if my words were my thoughts, my mind alone only formless confusion.\u0027I\u0027ll care for you because you can\u0027t care for yourself. But I don\u0027t want you near me. Sleep in that box you bought for yourself. Don\u0027t come near me.\u0027 \"\u0027I told you I was going to do it. I told you . : \u0027 she said. Never had her voice sounded so fragile, so like a little silvery bell. I looked up at her, startled but unshaken. Her face seemed not her face. Never had anyone shaped such agitation into the features of a doll.\u0027Louis, I told you!\u0027 she said, her lips quivering.\u0027I did it for us. So we could be free.\u0027 I couldn\u0027t stand the sight of her. Her beauty, her seeming innocence, and this terrible agitation. I went past her, perhaps knocking her backwards, I don\u0027t know. And I was almost to the railing of the steps when I heard a strange sound. \"Never in all the years of our life together had I heard this sound. Never since the night long ago when I had first found her, a mortal child, clinging to her mother. She was crying! \"It drew me back now against my will. Yet it sounded so unconscious, so hopeless, as though she meant no one to hear it, or didn\u0027t care if it were heard by the whole world. I found her lying on my bed in the place where I often sat to read, her knees drawn up, her whole frame shaking with her sobs. The sound of it was terrible. It was more heartfelt, more awful than her mortal crying had ever been. I sat down slowly, gently, beside her and put my hand on her shoulder. She lifted her head, startled, her eyes wide, her mouth trembling. Her face was stained with tears, tears that were tinted with blood. Her eyes brimmed with them, and the faint touch of red stained her tiny hand. She didn\u0027t seem to be conscious of this, to see it. She pushed her hair back from her forehead. Her body quivered then with a long, low, pleading sob. \"\u0027Louis... if I lose you, I have nothing,\u0027 she whispered.\u0027I would undo it to have you back. I can\u0027t undo what I\u0027ve done.\u0027 She put her arms around me, climbing up against me, sobbing against my heart. My hands were reluctant to touch her; and then they moved as if I couldn\u0027t stop them, to enfold her and hold her and stroke her hair.\u0027I can\u0027t live without you... : she whispered.\u0027I would die rather than live without you. I would die the same way he died. I can\u0027t bear you to look at me the way you did. I cannot bear it if you do not love Mel\u0027 Her sobs grew worse, more bitter, until finally I bent and kissed her soft neck and\u0027 cheeks. Winter plums. Plums from an enchanted wood where the fruit never falls from the boughs. Where the flowers never wither and die.\u0027All right, my dear... I said to her.\u0027All right, my love... : And I rocked her slowly, gently in my arms, until she dozed, murmuring something about our being eternally happy, free of Lestat forever, beginning the, great adventure of our lives.\" \"The great adventure of our lives. What does It mean to die when you can live until the end of the world? And what is\u0027the end of the world\u0027 except a phrase, because who knows even what is the world itself? I had now lived in two centuries, seen the illusions of one utterly shattered by the other, been eternally young and eternally ancient, . possessing no illusions, living moment to moment in a way that made me picture a silver clock ticking in a void: the, painted face, the delicately carved hands looked upon by no one, looking out at no one, illuminated by a light which was not a light, like the light by which God made the world before He had made light. Ticking, ticking, ticking, the precision of the clock, in a room as vast as the universe. \"I was walking the streets again, Claudia gone her way to kill, the perfume of her hair and dress lingering on my fingertips, on my coat, my eyes moving far ahead of me like the pale beam of a lantern. I found myself at the cathedral: What does it mean to die when you can live until the end of the world? I was thinking of my brother\u0027s death, of the incense and the rosary. I had the desire suddenly to be in that funeral room, listening to the sound of the women\u0027s voices rising and falling with the Aves, the clicking of the beads, the smell of the wax. I could remember the crying. It was palpable, as if it were just yesterday, just behind a door. I saw myself walking fast down a corridor and gently giving the door a shove. \"The great facade of the cathedral rose in a dark mass opposite the square, but the doors were open and I could see a soft, flickering light within. It was Saturday evening early, and the people were going to confession for Sunday Mass and Communion. Candles burned dim in the chandeliers. At the far end of the nave the altar loomed out of the shadows, laden with white flowers. It was to the old church on this spot that they had brought my brother for the final service before the cemetery. And I realized suddenly that I hadn\u0027t been in this place since, never once come up the stone steps, crossed the porch, and passed through the open doors. \"I had no fear. If anything, perhaps, I longed for something to happen, for the stones to tremble as I entered the shadowy foyer and saw the distant tabernacle on the altar. I remembered now that I had passed here once when the windows were ablaze and the sound of singing poured out into Jackson Square. I had hesitated then, wondering if there were some secret Lestat had never told me, something which might destroy me were I to enter. I\u0027d felt compelled to enter, but I had pushed this out of my mind, breaking loose from the fascination of the open doors, the throng of people making one voice. I had, had something for Claudia, a doll I was taking to her, a bridal doll I\u0027d lifted from a darkened toy shop window and placed in a great box with ribbons and tissue paper. A doll for Claudia. I remembered pressing on with it, hearing the heavy vibrations of the organ behind me, my eyes narrow from the great blaze of the candles. \"Now I thought of that moment; that fear in me at the very sight of the altar, the sound of the Pange Lingua. And I thought again, persistently, of my brother. I could see the coin rolling along up the center aisle, the procession of mourners behind it. I felt no fear now. As I said, I think if anything I felt a longing for some fear, for some reason for fear as I moved slowly along the dark, stone walls. The air was chill and damp in spite of summer. The thought of Claudia\u0027s doll came back to me. Where was that doll? For years Claudia had played with that doll. Suddenly I saw myself searching for the doll, in the relentless and meaningless manner one searches for something in a nightmare, coming on doors that won\u0027t open or drawers that won\u0027t shut, struggling over and over against the same meaningless thing, not knowing why the effort seems so desperate, why the sudden sight of a chair with a shawl thrown over it inspires the mind with horror. \"I was in the cathedral. A woman stepped out of the confessional and passed the long line of those who waited. A man who should have stepped up neat did not move; and my eye, sensitive even in my vulnerable condition, noted this, and I turned to see him. He was staring at me. Quickly I turned my back on him. I heard him enter the confessional and shut the door. I walked up the aisle of the church and then, more from exhaustion than from any conviction, went into an empty pew and sat down. I had almost genuflected from old habit. My mind seemed as muddled and tortured as that of any human. I closed my eyes for a moment and tried to banish all thoughts. Hear and see, I said to myself. And with this act of will, my senses emerged from the torment. All around me in the gloom I heard the whisper of prayers, the tiny click of the rosary beads; soft the sighing of the woman who knelt now at the Twelfth Station. Rising from the sea of wooden pews came the scent of rats. A rat moving somewhere near the altar, a rat in the great woodcarved side altar of the Virgin Mary. The gold candlesticks shimmered on the altar; a rich white chrysanthemum bent suddenly on its stem, droplets glistening on the crowded petals, a sour fragrance rising from a score of vases, from altars and side altars, from statues of Virgins and Christs and saints. I stared at the statues; I became obsessed suddenly and completely with the lifeless profiles, the staring eyes, the empty hands, the frozen folds. Then my body convulsed with such violence that I found myself pitched forward, my hand on the pew before me. It was a cemetery of dead forms, of funereal effigy and stone angels. I looked up and saw myself in a most palpable vision ascending the altar steps, opening the tiny sacrosanct tabernacle, reaching with monstrous hands for the consecrated ciborium, and taking the Body of Christ and strewing Its white wafers all over the carpet; and walking then on the sacred wafers, walking up and down before the altar, giving Holy Communion to the dust. I rose up now in the pew and stood there staring at this vision. I knew full well the meaning of it. \"God did not live in this church; these statues gave an image to nothingness. 1 was the supernatural in this cathedral. I was the only supermortal thing that stood conscious under this roof! Loneliness. Loneliness to the point of madness. The cathedral crumbled in my vision; the saints listed and fell. Rats ate the Holy Eucharist and nested on the sills. A solitary rat with an enormous tail stood tugging and gnawing at the rotted altar cloth until the candlesticks fell and rolled on the slime-covered stones. And I remained standing. Untouched. Undead-reaching out suddenly for the plaster hand of the Virgin and seeing it break in my hand, so that I held the hand crumbling in my palm, the pressure of my thumb turning it to powder. \"And then suddenly through the ruins, up through the open door through which I could see a wasteland in all directions, even the great river frozen over and stuck with the encrusted ruins of ships, up through these ruins now came a funeral procession, a band of pale, white men and women, monsters with gleaming eyes and flowing black clothes, the coffin rumbling on the wooden wheels, the rats scurrying across the broken and buckling marble, the procession advancing, so that I could see then Claudia in the procession, her eyes staring from behind a thin black veil, one gloved hand locked upon a black prayer book, the other on the coffin as it moved beside her. And there now in the coffin; beneath a glass cover, I saw to my horror the skeleton of Lestat, the wrinkled skin now pressed into the very texture of his bones, his eyes but sockets, his blond hair billowed on the white satin. \"The procession stopped. The mourners moved out, filling the dusty pews without a sound, and Claudia, turning with her book, opened it and lifted the veil back from her face, her eyes fixed on me as her finger touched the page.\u0027And now art thou cursed from the earth,\u0027 she whispered, her whisper rising in echo in the ruins.\u0027And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother\u0027s blood from thy hand. When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength. A fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth... and whoever slayeth thee, vengeance shall be taken on him seven-fold.\u0027 \"I shouted at her, I screamed, the scream rising up out of the depths of my being like some great rolling black force that broke from my lips and sent my body reeling against my will. A terrible sighing rose from the mourners, a chorus growing louder and louder, as I turned to see them all about me, pushing me into the aisle against the very sides of the coffin, so that I turned to get my balance and found both my hands upon it. And I stood there staring down not at the remains of Lestat, but at the body of my mortal brother. A quiet descended, as if a veil had fallen over all and made their forms dissolve beneath its soundless folds. There was my brother, blond and young and sweet as he had been in life, as real and warm to me now as he\u0027d been years and years beyond which I could never have remembered him thus, so perfectly was he re-created, so perfectly in every detail. His blond hair brushed back from his forehead, his eyes closed as if he slept, his smooth fingers around the crucifix on his breast, his lips so pink and silken I could hardly bear to see them and not touch them. And as I reached out just to touch the softness of his skin, the vision ended. \"I was sitting still in the Saturday night cathedral, the smell of the tapers thick in the motionless air, the woman of the stations gone and darkness gathering behind me, across from me, and now above me. A boy appeared in the black cassock of a lay brother, with a long extinguisher on a golden pole, putting its little funnel down upon one candle and then another and then another. I was stupefied He glanced at me and then away, as if not to disturb a man deep in prayer. And then, as he moved on up to the next chandelier, I felt a hand on my shoulder.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/interview-with-the-vampire-the-vampire-chronicles-1/page-13.html","bookId":2209,"book":{"id":2209,"title":"Interview with the Vampire (The Vampire Chronicles #1)","description":"Storyline: Interview With The Vampire (The Vampire Chronicles #1) Here are the confessions of a vampire.
