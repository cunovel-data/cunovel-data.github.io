But he stretched his long legs under the table and, leaning back, pressed his hands to his head as if exerting a great pressure on his temples.\n The boy, who had drawn himself up into a crouched position, his hands hugging his arms, unwound slowly. He glanced at the tapes and then back at the vampire. \"But you killed someone that night,\" he said.\n \"Every night,\" said the vampire.\n \"Why did you let him go then?\" asked the boy.\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" said the vampire, but it did not have the tone of truly I don\u0027t know, but rather, let it be. \"You look tired,\" said the vampire. \"You look cold.\"\n \"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" said the boy quickly. \"The room\u0027s a little cold; I don\u0027t care about that. You\u0027re not cold, are you?\"\n \"No.\" The vampire smiled and then his shoulders moved with silent laughter.\n A moment passed in which the vampire seemed to be thinking and the boy to be studying the vampire\u0027s face. The vampire\u0027s eyes moved to the boy\u0027s watch.\n \"She didn\u0027t succeed, did she?\" the boy asked softly.\n \"What do you honestly think?\" asked the vampire. He had settled back in his chair. He looked at the boy intently.\n \"That she was... as you said, destroyed,\" said the boy; and he seemed to feel the words, so that he swallowed after he\u0027d said the word destroyed. \"Was she?\" he asked.\n \"Don\u0027t you think that she could do it?\" asked the vampire.\n \"But he was so powerful. You said yourself you never knew what powers he had, what secrets he knew. How could she even be sure how to kill him? How did she try?\"\n The vampire looked at the boy for a long time, his expression unreadable to the boy, who found himself looking away, as though the vampire\u0027s eyes were burning lights. \"Why don\u0027t you drink from that bottle in your pocket?\" asked the vampire. \"It will make you warm.\"\n \"Oh, that.... : \u0027 said the boy. \"I was going to. I just. . : \u0027\n The vampire laughed. \"You didn\u0027t think it was polite!\" he said, and he suddenly slapped his thigh.\n \"That\u0027s true,\" the boy shrugged, smiling now; and he took the small flask out of his jacket pocket, unscrewed the gold cap, and took a sip. He held the bottle, now looking at the vampire.\n \"No,\" the vampire smiled and raised his hand to wave away the offer.\n Then his face became serious again and, sitting back, he went on.\n \"Lestat had a musician friend in the Rue Dumaine. We had seen him at a recital in the home of a Madame LeClair, who lived there also, which was at that time an extremely fashionable street; and this Madame LeClair, with whom Lestat was also occasionally amusing himself, had found the musician a room in another mansion nearby, where Lestat visited him often. I told you he played with his victims, made friends with them, seduced them into trusting and liking him, even loving him, before he killed. So he apparently played with this young boy, though it had gone on longer than any other such friendship I had ever observed. The young boy wrote good music, and often Lestat brought fresh sheets of it home and played the songs on the square grand in our parlor. The boy had a great talent, but you could tell that this music would not sell, because it was too disturbing. Lestat gave him money and spent evening after evening with him, often taking him to restaurants the boy could have never afforded, and he bought him all the paper and pens which he needed for the writing of his music.\n \"As I said, it had gone on far longer than any such friendship Lestat had ever had. And I could not tell whether he had actually become fond of a mortal in spite of himself or was simply moving towards a particularly grand betrayal and cruelty. Several times he\u0027d indicated to Claudia and me that he was headed out to kill the boy directly, but he had not. And, of course, I never asked him what he felt because it wasn\u0027t worth the great uproar my question would have produced. Lestat entranced with a mortal! He probably would have destroyed the parlor furniture in a rage.\n \"The next night-after that which I just described to you-he jarred me miserably by asking me to go with him to the boy\u0027s flat. He was positively friendly, in one of those moods when he wanted my companionship. Enjoyment could bring that out of him. Wanting to see a good play, the regular opera, the ballet. He always wanted me, along. I think I must have seen Macbeth with him fifteen times. We went to every Performance, even those by amateurs, and Lestat would stride home afterwards, repeating the lines to me and even shouting out to passers-by with an Outstretched finger,\u0027Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow!\u0027 until they skirted him as if he were drunk. But this effervescence was frenetic and likely to vanish in an instant; just a word or two of amiable feeling on my part, some suggestion that I found his companionship pleasant, could banish all such affairs for months. Even years. But now he came to me in such a mood and asked me to go to the boy\u0027s room. He was not above pressing my arm as he urged me. And I, dull, catatonic, gave him some miserable excuse, thinking only of Claudia, of the agent, of imminent disaster. I could feel it and wondered that he did not feel it. And finally he picked up a book from the floor and threw it at me, shouting,\u0027Read your damn poems, then! Rot!\u0027 And he bounded out.\n \"This disturbed me. I cannot tell you how it disturbed me. I wished him cold, impassive, gone. I resolved to plead with Claudia to drop this. I felt powerless, and hopelessly fatigued. But her door had been locked until she left, and I had glimpsed her only for a second while Lestat was chattering, a vision of lace and loveliness as she slipped on her coat; puffed sleeves again and a violet ribbon on her breast, her white lace stockings showing beneath the hem of the little gown, and her white slippers immaculate. She cast a cold look at me as she went out.\n \"When I returned later, satiated and for a while too sluggish for my own thoughts to bother me, I gradually began to sense that this was the night. She would try tonight.\n \"I cannot tell you how I knew this. Things about the flat disturbed me, alerted me. Claudia moved in the back parlor behind closed doors. And I fancied I heard another voice there, a whisper. Claudia never brought anyone to our flat; no one did except Lestat, who brought his women of the streets. But I knew there was someone there, yet I got no strong scent, no proper sounds. And then there were aromas in the air of food and drink. And chrysanthemums stood in the silver vase on the square grand-flowers which, to Claudia, meant death.\n \"Then Lestat came, singing something soft under his breath, his walking stick making a rat-tat-tat on the rails of the spiral stairs. He came down the long hall, his face flushed from the kill, his lips pink; and he set his music on the piano.\u0027Did I kill him or did I not kill him!\u0027 He Bashed the question at me now with a pointing finger.-\u0027What\u0027s your guess?\u0027\n \" \u0027You did not,\u0027 I said numbly. Because you invited me to go with you, and would never have invited me to share that kill.\u0027\n \"\u0027Ah, but! Did I kill him in a rage because you would not go. with me!\u0027 he said and threw back the cover from the keys. I could see that he would be able to go on like this until dawn. He was exhilarated.\n I watched him flip through the music, thinking, Can he die? Can he actually die? And does she mean to do this? At one point, I wanted to go to her and tell her we must abandon everything, even the proposed trip, and live as we had before. But I had the feeling now that there was no retreat. Since the day she\u0027d begun to question him, this-whatever it was to be-was inevitable. And I felt a weight on me, holding me in the chair.\n \"He pressed two chords with his hands. He had an immense reach and even in life could have been a fine pianist. But lie played without feeling; he was always outside the music, drawing it out of the piano as if by magic, by the virtuosity of his vampire senses and control; the music did not come through him, was not drawn through him by himself.\u0027Well, did I kill him?\u0027 he asked me again.\n \"\u0027No, you did not,\u0027 I said again, though I could just as easily have said the opposite. I was concentrating on keeping my face a mask.\n \"\u0027You\u0027re right. I did not,\u0027 he said.\u0027It excites me to be close to him, to think over and over, I can kill him and I will kill him but not now. And then to leave him and find someone who looks as nearly like him as possible. If he had brothers... why, rd kill them one by one. The family would succumb to a mysterious fever which dried up the very blood in their bodies!\u0027 he said, now mocking a barker\u0027s tone.\u0027Claudia has a taste for families. Speaking of families, I suppose you heard. The Freniere place is supposed to be haunted; they can\u0027t keep an overseer and the slaves run away.\u0027\n \"This was something I did not wish to hear in particular. Babette had died young, insane, restrained finally from wandering towards the ruins of Pointe du Lac, insisting she had seen the devil there and must find him; I\u0027d heard of it in wisps of gossip. And then came the funeral notices: rd thought occasionally of going to her, of trying some way to rectify what I had done; and other times I thought it would all heal itself; and in my new life of nightly killing, I had grown far from the attachment rd felt for her or for my sister or any mortal. And I watched the tragedy finally as one might from a theater balcony, moved from time to time, but never sufficiently to jump the railing and join the players on the stage.\n \"\u0027Don\u0027t talk of her,\u0027 I said.\n \"`Very well. I was talking of the plantation. Not her. Her! Your lady love, your fancy.\u0027 He smiled at me.\u0027You know, I had it all my way finally in the end, didn\u0027t I? But I was telling you about my young friend and how. .\n \" I wish you .would play the music,\u0027 I said softly, unobtrusively, but as persuasively as possible. Sometimes this worked with Lestat. If I said something just right he found himself doing what I\u0027d said. And now he did just that: with a little snarl, as if to say,\u0027You fool,\u0027 he began playing the music. I heard the doors of the back parlor open and Claudia\u0027s steps move down the hall. Don\u0027t come, Claudia, I was thinking, feeling; go away from it before we\u0027re all destroyed. But she came on steadily until she reached the hall mirror. I could hear her opening the small table drawer, and then the zinging of her hairbrush. She was wearing a floral perfume. I turned slowly to face her as she appeared in the door, still all in white, and moved across the carpet silently toward the piano. She stood at the end of the keyboard, her hands folded on the wood, her chin resting on her hands, her eyes fixed on Lestat.\n \"I could see his profile and her small face beyond, looking up at him. \u0027What is it now!\u0027 he said, turning the page and letting his hand drop to his thigh.\u0027You irritate me. Your very presence irritates me!\u0027 His eyes moved over the page.\n \"\u0027Does it?\u0027 she said in her sweetest voice.\n \"\u0027Yes, it does. And I\u0027ll tell you something else. I\u0027ve met someone who would make a better vampire than you do.\u0027\n \"This stunned me. But I didn\u0027t have to urge him to go on.\u0027Do you get my meaning?\u0027 he said to her.\n \"\u0027Is it supposed to frighten me?\u0027 she asked.\n \"\u0027You\u0027re spoiled because you\u0027re an only child,\u0027 he said.\u0027You need a brother. Or rather, I need a brother. I get weary of you both. Greedy, brooding vampires that haunt our own lives. I dislike it.\u0027\n \" \u0027I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us,\u0027 she said.\n \"\u0027You think so!\u0027 he said, smiling, his voice with a note of triumph. Do you think you could do it? I suppose Louis has told you how it was done or how he thinks it was done. You don\u0027t have the power. Either of you,\u0027 he said.\n \"This seemed to disturb her. Something she had not accounted for. She was studying him. I could see she did not entirely believe him.\n \"\u0027And what gave you the power?\u0027 she asked softly, but with a touch of sarcasm.\n \"\u0027That, my dear, is one of those things which you may never know. For even the Erebus in which we live must have its aristocracy.\u0027\n \"\u0027You\u0027re a liar,\u0027 she said with a short laugh. And just as he touched his fingers to the keys again, she said,\u0027But you upset my plans.\u0027\n \"\u0027Your plans?\u0027 he asked.\n \"\u0027I came to make peace with you, even if you are the father of lies. You\u0027re my father,\u0027 she said.\u0027I want to make peace with you. I want things to be as they were.\u0027\n \"Now he was the one who did not believe. He threw a glance at me, then looked at her.\u0027That can be. Just stop asking me questions. Stop following me. Stop searching in every alleyway for other vampires. There are no other vampires! And this is where you live and this is where you stay!\u0027 He looked confused for the moment, as if raising his own voice had confused him.\u0027I take care of you. You don\u0027t need anything.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/interview-with-the-vampire-the-vampire-chronicles-1/page-12.html","bookId":2209,"book":{"id":2209,"title":"Interview with the Vampire (The Vampire Chronicles #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Interview With The Vampire (The Vampire Chronicles #1) \n Here are the confessions of a vampire.
