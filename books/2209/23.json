{"id":102096,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"\"And now Santiago took up the same baiting manner.\u0027Yes, tell us of the covens, and the herbs that would render us invisible.\u0027 He smiled.\u0027And the burnings at the stake!\u0027 \"Armand fixed his eyes on Claudia.\u0027Beware those monsters,\u0027 he said, and calculatedly his eyes passed over Santiago and then Celeste.\u0027Those revenants. They will attack you as if you were human\u0027 \"Celeste shuddered, uttering something in contempt, an aristocrat speaking of vulgar cousins who bear the same name. But I was watching Claudia because it seemed her eyes were misted again as before. She looked away from Armand suddenly. \"The voices of the others rose again, affected party voices, as they conferred with one another on the night\u0027s kills, describing this or that encounter without a smattering of emotion, challenges to cruelty erupting from time to time like flashes of white lightning: a tall, thin vampire being accosted in one corner for a needless romanticizing of mortal life, a lack of spirit, a refusal to do the most entertaining thing at the moment it was available to him. He was simple, shrugging, stow at words, and would fall for long periods into a stupefied silence, as if, near-choked with blood, he would as soon have gone to his coffin as remained here. And yet he remained, held by the pressure of this unnatural group who had made of immortality a conformist\u0027s club. How would Lestat have found it? Had he been here? What had caused him to leave? No one had dictated to Lestat he was master of his small circle; but how they would have praised his inventiveness, his catlike toying with his victims. And waste... that word, that value which had been all-important to me as a fledgling vampire; was spoken of often. You\u0027wasted\u0027 the opportunity to kill this child. You\u0027wasted\u0027 the opportunity to frighten this poor woman or drive that man to madness, which only a little prestidigitation Would have accomplished. \"My head was spinning. A common mortal headache. I longed to get away from these vampires, and only the distant figure of Armand held me, despite his warnings. He seemed remote from the others now, though he nodded often enough and uttered a few words here and there so that he seemed a part of them, his hand only occasionally rising from the lion\u0027s paw of his chair. And my heart expanded when I saw him this way, saw that no one amongst the small throng caught his glance as I caught his glance, and no one held it from time to time as I held it. Yet he remained aloof from me, his eyes alone returning to me. His warning echoed in my ears, yet I disregarded it. I longed to get away from the theater altogether and stood listlessly, garnering information at last that was useless and infinitely dull. \"\u0027But is there no crime amongst you, no cardinal crime?\u0027 Claudia asked. Her violet eyes seemed fixed on me, even in the mirror, as I stood with my back to her. \"\u0027Crime! Boredom!\u0027 cried out Estelle, and she pointed a white finger at Armand. He laughed softly with her from his distant position at the end of the room.\u0027Boredom is death!\u0027 she cried and bared her vampire fangs, so that Armand put a languid hand to his forehead in a stage gesture of fear and falling. \"But Santiago, who was watching with his hands behind his back, intervened.\u0027Crime!\u0027 he said.\u0027Yes, there is a crime. A crime for which we would hunt another vampire down until we destroyed him. Can you guess what that is?\u0027 He glanced from Claudia to me and back again to her masklike face.\u0027You should know, who are so secretive about the vampire that made you.\u0027 \"\u0027And why is that?\u0027 she asked, her eyes widening ever so slightly, her hands resting still in her lap. \"A hush fell over the room, gradually then completely, all those white faces turned to face Santiago as he stood there, one foot forward, his hands clasped behind his back, towering over Claudia. His eyes gleamed as he saw he had the floor. And then he broke away and crept up behind me, putting his hand on my shoulder.\u0027Can you guess what that crime is? Didn\u0027t your vampire master tell you?\u0027 \"And drawing me slowly around with those invading familiar hands, he tapped my heart lightly in time with its quickening pace. \"\u0027It is the crime that means death to any vampire anywhere who commits it. It is to kill your own kind!\u0027 \"\u0027Aaaaah!\u0027 Claudia cried out, and lapsed into peals of laughter. She was walking across the floor now with swirling lavender silk and crisp resounding steps. Taking my hand, she said,\u0027I was so afraid it was to be born like Venus out of the foam, as we were! Master vampire! Come, Louis, let\u0027s go!\u0027 she beckoned, as she pulled me away. \"Armand was laughing. Santiago was still. And it was Armand who rose when we reached the door.\u0027You\u0027re welcome tomorrow night,\u0027 he said.\u0027And the night after.\u0027 \"I don\u0027t think I caught my breath until rd reached the street. The rain was still falling, and all of the street seemed sodden and desolate in the rain, but beautiful. A few scattered bits of paper blowing in the wind, a gleaming carriage passing slowly with the thick, rhythmic clop of the horse. The sky was pale violet. I sped fast, with Claudia beside me leading the way, then finally frustrated with the length of my stride, riding in my arms. \"\u0027I don\u0027t like them,\u0027 she said to me with a steel fury as we neared the Hotel Saint-Gabriel. Even its immense, brightly lit lobby was still in the pre-dawn hour. I spirited past the sleepy clerks, the long faces at the desk.\u0027I\u0027ve searched for them the world over, and I despise them!\u0027 She threw off her cape and walked into the center of the room. A volley of rain hit the French windows. I found myself turning up the lights one by one and lifting the candelabrum to the gas flames as if I were Lestat or Claudia. And then, seeking the puce velvet chair I\u0027d envisioned in that cellar, I slipped down into it, exhausted. It seemed for the moment as if the room blazed about me; as my eyes fixed on a gilt-framed painting of pastel trees and serene waters, the vampire spell was broken. They couldn\u0027t touch us here, and yet I knew this to be a lie, a foolish lie. \"\u0027I am in danger, danger,\u0027 Claudia said with that smoldering wrath. \" But how can they know what we did to him? Besides, we are in danger! Do you think for a moment I don\u0027t acknowledge my own guilt! And if you wire the only one... : I reached out for her now as she drew near, but her fierce eyes settled on me and I let my hands drop back limp.\u0027Do you think I would leave you in danger?\u0027 \"She was smiling. For a moment I didn\u0027t believe my eyes.\u0027No, you would not, Louis. You would not. Danger holds you to me.... \"\u0027Love holds me to you,\u0027 I said softly. \"\u0027Love?\u0027 she mused.\u0027What do you mean by love?\u0027 And then, as if she could see the pain in my face, she came close and put her hands on my cheek. She was cold, unsatisfied, as I was cold and unsatisfied, teased by that mortal boy but unsatisfied. \"\u0027That you take my love for granted always,\u0027 I said to her.\u0027That we are wed.... \u0027 But even as I said these words I felt my old conviction waver; I felt that torment I\u0027d felt last night when she had taunted me about mortal passion. I turned away from her. \"\u0027You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned to you .... \"\u0027Never... : I said to her. \"\u0027You would leave me, and he wants you as you want him. He\u0027s been waiting for you.... \"\u0027Never.... \u0027 I rose now and made my way to that chest. The doors were locked, but they would not keep those vampires out. Only we could keep them out by rising as early as the light would let us. I turned to her and told her to come. And she was at my side. I wanted to bury my face in her hair, I wanted to beg her forgiveness. Because, in truth, she was right; and yet I loved her, loved her as always. And now, as I drew her in close to me, she said\u0027Do you know what it was that he told me over and over without ever speaking a word; do you know what was the kernel of the trance he put me in so my eyes could only look at him, so that he pulled me as if my heart were on a string?\u0027 \" \u0027So you felt it... : I whispered.\u0027So it was the same.\u0027 \"\u0027He rendered me powerless!\u0027 she said. I saw the image of her against those books above his desk, her limp neck, her dead hands. \"\u0027But what are you saying? That he spoke to you, that he... \u0027 \"\u0027Without words!\u0027 she repeated. I could see the gaslights going dim, the candle flames too solid in their stillness. The rain beat on the panes.\u0027Do you know what he said... that I should die!\u0027 she whispered.\u0027That I should let you go.\u0027 \"I shook my head, and yet in my monstrous heart I felt a surge of excitement. She spoke the truth as she believed it. There was a film in her eyes, glassy and silver.\u0027He draws life out of me into himself,\u0027 she said, her lovely lips trembling so, I couldn\u0027t bear it. I held her tight, but the tears stood in her eyes.\u0027Life out of the boy who is his slave, life out of me whom he would make his slave. He loves you. He loves you. He would have you, and he would not have me stand in the way.\u0027 \"\u0027You don\u0027t understand him!\u0027 I fought it, kissing her; I wanted to shower her with kisses, her cheek, her lips. \"\u0027No, I understand him only too well,\u0027 she whispered to my lips, even as they kissed her.\u0027It is you who don\u0027t understand him. Love\u0027s blinded you, your fascination with his knowledge, his power. If you knew how he drinks death you\u0027d hate him more than you ever hated Lestat. Louis, you must never return to him. I tell you, I\u0027m in danger!\u0027 \" \"Early the next night, I left her, convinced that Armand alone among the vampires of the theater could be trusted. She let me go reluctantly, and I was troubled, deeply, by the expression in her eyes. Weakness was unknown to her, and yet I saw fear and something beaten even now as she let me go. And I hurried on my mission, waiting outside the theater until the last of the patrons had gone and the doormen were tending to the locks. \"What they thought I was, I wasn\u0027t certain. An actor, like the others, who did not take off his paint? It didn\u0027t matter. What mattered was that they let me through, and I passed them and the few vampires in the ballroom, unaccosted, to stand at last at Armand\u0027s open door. He saw me immediately, no doubt had heard my step a long way off, and he welcomed me at once and asked me to sit down. He was busy with his human boy, who was dining at the desk on a silver plate of meats and fish. A decanter of white wine stood next to him, and though he was feverish and weak from last night, his skin was florid and his heat and fragrance were a torment to me. Tot apparently to Armand, who sat in the leather chair by the fire opposite me, turned to the human, his arms folded on the leather arm. The boy filled his glass and held it up now in a salute. \u0027My master,\u0027 he said, his eyes flashing on me as he smiled; but the toast was to Armand. \"\u0027Your slave,\u0027 Armand whispered with a deep intake of breath that was passionate. And he watched, as the boy drank deeply. I could see him savoring the wet lips, the mobile flesh of the throat as the wine went down. And now the boy took a morsel of white meat, making that same salute, and consumed it slowly, his eyes fixed on Armand. It was as though Armand feasted upon the feast, drinking in that part of life which he could not share any longer except with his eyes. And lost though he seemed to it, it was calculated; not that torture I\u0027d felt years ago when I stood outside Babette\u0027s window longing for her human life. \"When the boy had finished, he knelt with his arms around Armand\u0027s neck as if he actually savored the icy flesh. And I could remember the night Lestat first came to me, how his eyes seemed to burn, how his white face gleamed. You know what I am to you now. \"Finally, it was finished. He was to sleep, and Armand locked the brass gates against him. And in minutes, heavy with his meal, he was dozing, and Armand sat opposite me, his large, beautiful eyes tranquil and seemingly innocent. When I felt them pull me towards him, I dropped my eyes, wished for a fire in the grate, but there were only ashes. \"`You told me to say nothing of my origin, why was this?\u0027 I asked, looking up at him. It was as if he could sense my holding back, yet wasn\u0027t offended, only regarding me with a slight wonder. But I was weak, too weak for his wonder, and again I looked away from him. \"\u0027Did you kill this vampire who made you? Is that why you are here without him, why you won\u0027t say his name? Santiago thinks that you did.\u0027 \"`And if this is true, or if we can\u0027t convince you otherwise, you would try to destroy us?\u0027 I asked. \"\u0027I would not try to do anything to you,\u0027 he said, calmly.\u0027But as I told you, I am not the leader here in the sense that you asked.\u0027 \"\u0027Yet they believe you to be the leader, don\u0027t they? And Santiago, you shoved him away from me twice.\u0027 \"\u0027I\u0027m more powerful than Santiago, older. Santiago is younger than you are,\u0027 he said. His voice was simple, devoid of pride. These were facts. \"\u0027We want no quarrel with you.\u0027 \"`It\u0027s begun,\u0027 he said.\u0027But not with me. With those above.\u0027 \"\u0027But what reason has he to suspect us?\u0027 \"He seemed to be thinking now, his eyes cast down, his chin resting on his closed fist. After a while which seemed interminable, he looked up.\u0027I could give you reasons,\u0027 he said.\u0027That you are too silent. That the vampires of the world are a small number and live in terror of strife amongst themselves and choose their fledglings with great care, making certain that they respect the other vampires mightily. There are fifteen vampires in this house, and the number is jealously guarded. And weak vampires are feared; I should say this also. That you are flawed is obvious to them: you feel too much, you think too much. As you said yourself, vampire detachment is not of great value to you. And then there is this mysterious child: a child who can never grow, never be self-sufficient. I would not make a vampire of that boy there now if his life, which is so precious to me, were in serious danger, because he is too young, his limbs not strong enough, his mortal cup barely tasted: yet you bring with you this child. What manner of vampire made her, they ask; did you make her? So, you see, you bring with you these flaws and this mystery and yet you are completely silent. And so you cannot be trusted. And Santiago looks for an excuse. But there is another reason closer to the truth than all those things which I\u0027ve just said to you. And that is simply this: that when you first encountered Santiago in the Latin Quarter you... unfortunately... called him a buffoon.\u0027 \"\u0027Aaaaah.\u0027 I sat back. \" \u0027It would perhaps have been better all around if you had said nothing.\u0027 And he smiled to see that I understood with him the irony of this. \"I sat reflecting upon what he\u0027d said, and what weighed as heavily upon me through all of it were Claudia\u0027s strange admonitions, that this gentle-eyed young man had said to her, \u0027Die,\u0027 and beyond that my slowly accumulating disgust with the vampires in the ballroom above. \"I felt an overwhelming desire to speak to him of these things. Of her fear, no, not yet, though I couldn\u0027t believe when I looked into his eyes that he\u0027d tried to wield this power over her: his eyes said, Live. His eyes said, Learn. And oh, how much I wanted to confide to him the breadth of what I didn\u0027t understand; how, searching all these years, I\u0027d been astonished to discover those vampires above had made of immortality a club of fads and cheap conformity. And yet through this sadness, this confusion, came the clear realization: Why should it be otherwise? What had I expected? What right had I to be so bitterly disappointed in Lestat that I would let him diet Because he wouldn\u0027t show me what I must find in myself? Armand\u0027s words, what had they been? The only power that exists is inside ourselves... \"\u0027Listen to me,\u0027 he said now.\u0027You must stay away from them. Your face hides nothing. You would yield to me now were I to question you. Look into my eyes\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/interview-with-the-vampire-the-vampire-chronicles-1/page-23.html","bookId":2209,"book":{"id":2209,"title":"Interview with the Vampire (The Vampire Chronicles #1)","description":"Storyline: Interview With The Vampire (The Vampire Chronicles #1) Here are the confessions of a vampire.
