{"id":17242,"no":21,"title":"CHAPTER XXI LADY WATSON\u0027S STORY","content":"\"My mother!\" Beatrice stopped short at the door, and caught hold of a chair to support herself. The shock of this discovery came upon her with overwhelming force. \"Impossible!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is true,\" said Lady Watson, advancing towards her with outstretched arms. \"I am your most unhappy mother.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The girl suffered the little woman to embrace her, but did not return the caress. \"My mother!\" she repeated again faintly; \"it is impossible, Lady Watson.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t call me Lady Watson. I am your mother. I should not have told you: I promised Durban that I would not. But Nature is too, too strong,\" cried Lady Watson theatrically; \"my heart spoke, and I responded. Darling! darling!\" She embraced Beatrice still more affectionately, and guided her to a low armchair, into which the bewildered girl sank unresistingly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Was Lady Watson in earnest? Was she really her mother? Were these violent demonstrations genuine? Beatrice could not tell. The whole thing seemed to be beyond the bounds of possibility. What of the supposed mother who was buried in Hurstable churchyard? Revolving these things in a much-puzzled brain, Beatrice sat silently staring at the artificial little woman who claimed so sacred a relationship. Lady Watson, seeing the girl\u0027s coldness--as she thought it was--squeezed out a few serviceable tears. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, cruel, cruel!\" she wept. \"My own child--the baby that I carried in my arms--to act like this! It is wicked, it is incredible.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mother!\" said Beatrice blankly. \"Are you really and truly my mother?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course I am,\" snapped the elder woman, drying her tears. \"How often do you wish me to repeat it? I am not in the habit of calling other people\u0027s children my children. Can\u0027t you say something more affectionate, you cold-hearted girl?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is all so strange--so new,\" gasped Beatrice. \"Tell me how it came about that I never knew this until now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s Durban\u0027s fault,\" said Lady Watson sullenly. \"Durban always hated me, though I\u0027m sure I was always kind to him--the beast!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Durban is a good man,\" said Beatrice quickly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh! dear me, that is exactly the exasperating sort of thing your father would have said. He was a good man also--the kind of man I most particularly hate. Never mind, I\u0027ll make everything plain to you. I\u0027ve held my tongue long enough. Now I am going to speak out, and take back to my hungry heart the baby girl I loved.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did you really love me?\" asked Beatrice doubtfully. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes--really I did. You were all that I had to love, as my husband--the first one, your father--was a kind of stone image with no feelings and no affections. I loved you fondly, and wanted to be your dearest mother--which I certainly am--but that Durban and that horrid Alpenny were too strong for me. No, it wasn\u0027t Alpenny. I don\u0027t think he wanted to bring you up; but Durban insisted, and I gave way.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why did you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There were reasons,\" said Lady Watson evasively, and a spot of red burned on either cheek. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They must have been strong reasons to make a mother surrender her child to the care of strangers.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Durban wasn\u0027t a stranger. He was in the house when you were born; and really you might have been his own child, from the fuss he made over you. But Colonel Hall--your father, my dear--saved Durban from being lynched in America, and Durban always pretended that he loved him dearly.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am sure Durban did,\" insisted Beatrice. \"He is not a man who says one thing and does another.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That is just what he does do,\" cried Lady Watson, fanning herself with a flimsy handkerchief all lace and scent. \"Look at the way he has kept you in the dark all these years. And I am quite sure that he has told you heaps and heaps of lies! These niggers never can tell the truth.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Durban told me as little as he could,\" confessed Beatrice; \"but he never told me a deliberate lie, I am sure. But if you are my mother, who is the woman who is buried as you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not as me--the idea!\" protested Lady Watson; \"as Alpenny\u0027s wife--and a nice bargain she got in that old scoundrel! She was Amelia Hedge, and called herself Mrs. Hedge when she married Alpenny, to account for you. It wasn\u0027t my fault. I\u0027m sure I always liked to have you with me, Beatrice, as you were such a pretty child, and it looks well to have one\u0027s children about one, nowadays. But Durban would insist that I should give you up--and perhaps he was right after all,\" ended Lady Watson candidly \"as Sir Reginald--my second husband--would never have married a widow with a child.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n So the weak little woman babbled on, and Beatrice felt her heart sink as she at last beheld her mother. To think that this frivolous and weak creature should have given her birth! Then a thought came to her. \"Durban said that my mother was quiet and silent.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And so I was, for years and years and years. Colonel Hall--I never could call him George, he was so military and stiff--made my life a perfect burden, and never would give me any pleasure. I was crushed, Beatrice, perfectly crushed, and held my tongue because I could not be natural. I was a dull, dowdy thing in those days. But now I really am something to look at and to listen to!\" and Lady Watson smirked in a near mirror at her artificial beauty. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mother,\" said Beatrice, accepting what appeared to be the inevitable with a good grace, although the discovery of the relationship did not please her, \"will you tell me if you had anything to do with the murder of my father?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, dear me! no,\" said Lady Watson perfectly calmly, and showing no signs of indignation at the accusation,--which it was, in a way. \"Of course Durban made capital out of it, and forced me to part with you and the necklace because of that horrid death. But I\u0027ve got back the necklace\"--Lady Watson fingered it fondly--\"and you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How did you get the necklace?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A friend of mine called Miss Carr gave it to me. She got it from her father, though I don\u0027t know how he got it, I\u0027m sure. Major Ruck--you know the man, dear?--wanted Maud--that is Miss Carr--to give it up, and would have killed her for it. He\u0027s just the sort of bully who would kill a woman to get money, and I don\u0027t mind saying it, although he was my friend. So Maud, to spite him, gave it to me, and----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wait one moment, mother. Were you not going to elope with Major----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Lady Watson interrupted in her turn, and uttered an embarrassed scream. \"Yes, I was, my dear. Your father was a bear--there\u0027s no good saying anything else. He was a bear! I couldn\u0027t stand his Puritan airs any longer, and on the very night he was murdered I intended to elope with him, to pay your father out. But Alpenny met me----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"At the head of the stairs?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who told you that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mrs. Snow,\" said Beatrice promptly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Julia Duncan? Ah, she always was a false-hearted cat. Why, the very last time I saw her, and that was when I went down to get Alpenny\u0027s money, she promised to hold her tongue.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I forced her to speak.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And you have forced me, you clever girl. I promised Durban never to reveal who I really was but I did so, through natural affections; and now you know. I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t care,\" added Lady Watson with a reckless air. \"Durban can do his worst.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What can he do?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Accuse me of your father\u0027s murder, although I\u0027m as innocent as a child. But I dare say he\u0027ll hold his tongue if I pay him well. He was always fond of money, and Alpenny\u0027s legacy has made me rich.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think Durban can be bribed, nor do I think he is fond of money,\" said Beatrice with decision. \"But for my sake, he may hold his tongue.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I shan\u0027t give up the Obi necklace,\" muttered Lady Watson. \"The Colonel bought it for me; he got it from a Brazilian negro, and said there was a curse on it,--at least the negro did. For that reason your father--who really was fond of me, I suppose, although he had a horrid, dull way of showing his love--would not give it to me. He kept it in a green box along with his papers beside his bed, and I got it from there when he was lying dead.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did you see him dead?\" asked Beatrice, horrified. \"Of course I did. That is why Durban says that I killed him. He always did hate me, the beast!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Beatrice passed her hand wearily across her forehead. \"I cannot gather much from these scraps of information,\" she said irritably; \"please tell me all connectedly and from the beginning.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, dear me, how very like your father you are!\" said Lady Watson, with an affected shudder. \"He was always so very precise: I don\u0027t know how I came to marry so dull a man. But my father made the match. He was a planter in Jamaica, and Colonel Hall was stationed at Port Royal I was merely a child--seventeen, in fact--and the Colonel fell in love with me. I married him, although I liked twenty other men better. Sir Reginald was one; but he went to England, on leave, and my father made me marry the Colonel while Reginald was away. He was in a rage when he came back. Afterwards, when the Colonel died so dreadfully, Sir Reginald married me, as he knew--if no one else did--that I had nothing to do with that horrid murder.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tell me the events of that night,\" said Beatrice keeping the voluble little woman to the point. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027m doing it, if you will only let me speak,\" snapped Lady Watson; \"but you are like your father, and want me to hold my tongue as he did. I\u0027m sure I never opened my mouth for years with that man. Shortly after you were born we went to England. Amelia and Durban came also, as Durban would never leave the Colonel; and Amelia was brought for your sake, you being a baby--and a very pretty one too. Colonel Hall went down to see Mr. Paslow at Convent Grange, as they were great friends. I stopped in London for a time, as I was so sick of the Colonel\u0027s stiffness. Then I came down because he insisted on it. Major Ruck--who was really a nice man in those days--followed, and stopped at The Camp, as he wished me to elope with him. On the night of the murder I arranged to do so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Had the Major anything to do with the murder?\" asked Beatrice hurriedly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He said he hadn\u0027t, but he might have told a lie. He never could tell the truth,\" said Lady Watson vaguely. \"But as I was saying--and don\u0027t interrupt again, please--I dressed late at night I knew that Mr. Paslow, and Alpenny, and the Colonel had gone to bed. Your father and I were in different rooms, because we had quarrelled. I came out into the passage, and intended to meet Major Ruck at The Camp, where he had a carriage waiting. Alpenny should have been at The Camp also, only he stopped at the Grange--to spite me, I believe, as he loved me, and wanted to prevent my elopement.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did he know about it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes. He wheedled the information out of the Major, and learned also that I intended to bring the Obi necklace with me. It was because of the necklace, as well as because of his love for me, that he stopped at the Grange to thwart me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But the necklace was in my father\u0027s possession?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In a green dispatch box beside his bed,\" explained Lady Watson. \"You are quite right, dear; so it was. I stole out into the passage, and there I met at the head of the stairs that horrid Alpenny, who was on the watch. Julia Snow was watching also, as she told me afterwards. The horrid woman, she loved George, and----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know--I know--please go on.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am going on,\" cried Lady Watson in despair; \"but you will interrupt. Alpenny said he wanted to help me to get away, which was a lie. I believed him, and we went to the Colonel\u0027s chamber. I could easily make some excuse, you know; that I had the toothache or something, and George would believe me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But your dress--your hat?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, I took those off and gave them to Alpenny, who remained outside the bedroom door. When I went in I nearly screamed, for the Colonel did look so horrid, lying in bed with his throat cut. I could see it and him, plainly in the moonlight. I called Alpenny, and we were both afraid. Then I saw the box, and got out the necklace.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ugh!\" said Beatrice, disgusted at this callous behaviour. \"Why didn\u0027t you call for help?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What! and be arrested? Everyone knew that George and I were on bad terms; and besides, with the necklace in my possession, I might have been accused of killing him. Alpenny said we had better take the necklace and go away. The window was open, and I suppose the man who killed the Colonel got in there. I took the necklace, and went out into the passage with Alpenny, closing the door after me. I put on my hat and cloak, and then he refused to let me go to The Camp to meet the Major unless I gave him the necklace. I had to, and then went back to bed.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t you elope?\" asked Beatrice sarcastically. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My dear, my nerves were shattered, and it would have been most dangerous. I went to bed, and pretended to be horrified when I heard of the murder. The Major would not marry me when he found that I hadn\u0027t got the necklace; so after the inquest I came to town, and met Reginald Watson. I told him everything, and he married me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But how did my nurse marry Mr. Alpenny?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Durban arranged that,\" said Lady Watson promptly. \"He was almost mad when he found the Colonel was dead, and he forced the truth out of me. I believe Julia Snow told him what she had seen. I knew Durban would say nothing, because if he hated me, he loved you and your father. He did hold his tongue, but he insisted that Alpenny should give the necklace to him in trust for you. Of course Alpenny would not do so, and Durban threatened to inform the police. Then Durban, who didn\u0027t know much about English law, thought that he might get into trouble and be accused. I really don\u0027t know,\" added Lady Watson, pondering, \"if I didn\u0027t threaten to accuse him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, how could you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, he might be guilty. Niggers always prefer to cut throats, and your father certainly died in that horrid way.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The man with the black patch killed him?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did he? I heard something about that; but I\u0027m not sure. However, to make a long story short, Durban arranged that you should be taken charge of by Alpenny, and that he should look after you along with Amelia, who was consumptive.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But why?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Lady Watson rose wrathfully. \"You may well ask that, Beatrice. Why? Because, if you please, this nigger didn\u0027t think I was a proper person to look after you. Then Amelia refused to go to The Camp unless she went--as she said, respectably. Alpenny, who was in love with me, and knew that I intended to marry Sir Reginald, agreed to marry her in order to keep the necklace. Amelia died shortly afterwards, and for the sake of safety was buried as your mother: you took her name of Hedge, you know. That\u0027s the story.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is a very horrible one,\" said Beatrice, rising in her turn. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lady Watson burst into tears. \"It is not my fault,\" she sobbed. \"I\u0027m sure, in spite of Reginald\u0027s objections, I would have kept you beside me; only Durban took you away, and Amelia also, because she wanted to marry a rich man, as Alpenny was supposed. They knew too much; I had to yield; and then Reginald thought you were dead. But I have always loved and longed for my pretty baby. Kiss me, darling!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" said Beatrice sternly. \\n\\n \\n\\n The little woman looked up aghast. \"Your own mother?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do not look upon you as my mother,\" said the girl coldly. \"You deserted me in the most heartless manner. I don\u0027t know how much of your story is true----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is all true--I swear it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It may be, and you may be innocent. But to see my father lying dead, and not give the alarm, was wicked. The assassin might have been caught and----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I would have been caught!\" cried Lady Watson vehemently. \"As it was, people thought that I had something to do with the horrid thing. I was quite innocent,\" she protested, sobbing. \"Beatrice!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Her voice rose to a scream as the girl walked to the door for the second time. \"I am going,\" said Beatrice quietly. \"You must give me time to think over our new relationship. I\u0027ll see you again soon.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh!\" wailed Lady Watson, as the door closed on the daughter who rejected her; \"how like your father--how very like!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Beatrice walked calmly down the stairs, and opening the front door herself, returned to the hotel to think over the matter. At the door of the little inn she found the stout landlady arguing with a red-haired, foxy man. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Waterloo!\" said Beatrice, drawing back. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There,\" chuckled the rogue, grinning at the landlady, \"she knows me does the young lydy.--Miss, come at once--Durban\u0027s dying.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Durban dying!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027ll be dead in a jiffy,\" said Waterloo, grinning. \"You come, miss.\" Then dropping his voice, \"He wants to tell you who killed your father.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1854/53710.html","bookId":967,"book":{"id":967,"title":"The Black Patch","description":"简介： Of course he\u0027s a wretch, dear; but oh!--with an ecstatic expression--what a nice wretch!I see; you marry the adjective....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1854","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:04 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:04 AM"}}
