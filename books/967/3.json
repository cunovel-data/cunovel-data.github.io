{"id":17224,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III MR. ALPENNY\u0027S PROPOSAL","content":"Shortly after Durban resumed work, Beatrice received a surprise which rather pleased her. This was none other than an invitation to enter the counting-house. She had always desired to do so, being filled with that curiosity which led her grandmother Eve to eat apples, but hitherto Alpenny had declined to admit her. Now the door of the dungeon was open, and Alpenny, standing before it, beckoned that she should come in. In the bright sunshine he looked more decrepit and wicked than usual. He could not have been less than eighty years of age, and his spare figure was bowed with Time. That same Time had also robbed him of every hair on his head, and had even taken away eyebrows and eyelashes. As the old man was clean shaven, his gleaming head and hairless yellow wrinkled face looked rather repulsive. Nor did his dress tend to improve his appearance, for it was a shepherd\u0027s-plaid suit cut in the style of the early fifties, when he had been young, and presumably something of a dandy. In spite of the antiquity of the clothes, there was a suggestion of juvenility about them which matched badly with his Methuselah looks. Like an aged ghost he beckoned in the sunshine, and the white-painted erection behind him assumed, in the eyes of Beatrice, the look of a tomb. Wondering that she should be invited into Mammon\u0027s Shrine, the girl walked across the lawn. In her white dress, with her beautiful face shaded by a coarse straw hat, she appeared the embodiment of youth and grace, contrasting markedly with the senile old villain, who croaked out his orders. \"Come in,\" said Alpenny testily, and with the screech of a peacock, as he pointed to the open door. \"I wish to speak to you seriously.\" Beatrice, ever sparing of words with crabbed age, nodded and entered the counting-house, glancing comprehensively around to take in her surroundings--as a woman always does--with a single look. The space naturally was limited. All the windows had been boarded up save one, which opened immediately over a rather large desk of mahogany which was piled with papers. The walls were hung with faded red rep. In one corner stood a large green-painted safe; in another stood a pile of tin boxes which reached quite to the roof. A paraffin lamp dangled by brass chains from a somewhat smoky ceiling; and at the far end of the carriage, in front of a dilapidated bookcase, was an oil stove, crudely set on a sheet of galvanised tin. A ragged carpet, disorderly in colour and much faded, covered the floor; and there were only two chairs, one before the desk, and another beside it, probably for the use of clients. The one window was barred, but not covered with any curtain; the others were sheathed in iron and barred strongly outside. From without, as has been said, the carriage looked like a dungeon: within, its appearance suggested the home of a recluse, who cared very little for the pomps and vanities of civilisation. This barren room represented very fairly the bare mind of the miser, who cared more for money itself, than for what money could do. Motioning Beatrice to the client\u0027s chair, Alpenny seated himself before his desk, and from habit presumably, began to fiddle with some legal looking documents. Apparently he had got over the shock caused by Vivian\u0027s strange speech, and looked much the same as he always did--cold, unsympathetic, and cunning as an old monkey. In the dungeon Beatrice bloomed like a rose, while Alpenny resembled a cold, clammy toad, uncanny and repulsive. He began to speak almost immediately, and his first words amazed the girl. They were the last she expected to hear from the lips of one who had always treated her with indifference, and almost with hostility. \"Have you ever thought of marriage?\" asked the usurer, examining his visitor\u0027s face with two small sharp eyes, chilly and grey. \"Marriage!\" she gasped, doubting if she had heard aright. \"Yes, marriage. Young girls think of such things, do they not?\" Wishing to find out what he meant, Beatrice fenced. \"I have no chance of marrying, father,\" she observed, regaining her composure. \"I grant that, unless you have fallen in love with Jerry Snow; and I credit you with too much sense, to think you could love a fool.\" \"Mr. Snow is to marry Miss Paslow,\" announced Beatrice coldly, and kept her eyes on the wizen face before her. \"Oh,\" sneered Alpenny, \"Hunger wedding Thirst. And how do they intend to live, may I ask?\" \"That is their business, and not ours.\" \"Paslow hasn\u0027t a penny to give to his giggling sister, and very soon he won\u0027t have a roof over his head.\" \"What do you mean by that, father?\" \"Mean!\" The usurer stretched out a skinny hand, which resembled the claw of a bird of preys as he looked like. \"Why, I mean, my girl, that I hold Vivian Paslow there,\" and he tapped his palm. \"Still I don\u0027t understand,\" said Beatrice, her blood running cold at the malignant look on his face. \"There is no need you should,\" rejoined her stepfather coolly. \"He is not for you, and you are not for him. Do you understand that?\" It was unwise for Alpenny to meddle with a maiden\u0027s fancies, for the girl\u0027s outraged womanhood revolted. \"I understand that you mean to be impertinent, Mr. Alpenny,\" she said, with a flaming colour. \"\u0027Mr. Alpenny\u0027? Why not \u0027father,\u0027 as usual?\" \"Because you are no father of mine, and I thank God for it.\" He gave her a vindictive look, and rubbed his hands together, with the croak of a hungry raven. \"I brought you up, I educated you, I fed you, I housed you, I----\" Beatrice waved her hand impatiently. \"I know well what you have done,\" said she; \"as little as you could.\" \"Here\u0027s gratitude!\" \"And common sense, Mr. Alpenny. I know nothing, save that you married my mother and promised to look after me when she died.\" \"I promised nothing,\" snapped Alpenny. \"Durban says that you did.\" \"Durban is, what he always was, a fool. I promised nothing to your mother--at all events, concerning you. Why should I? You are not my own flesh and blood.\" \"Anyone can tell that,\" said Beatrice disdainfully. \"No impertinence, miss. I have fed and clothed you, and educated you, and housed you----\" \"You said that before.\" \"All at my own expense,\" went on the miser imperturbably, \"and out of the kindness of my heart. This is the return you make, by giving me sauce! But you had better take care,\" he went on menacingly, and shaking a lean yellow finger, \"I am not to be trifled with.\" \"Neither am I,\" retorted Beatrice, who felt in a fighting humour. \"I am sorry to have been a burden to you, and for what you have done I thank you; but I am weary of stopping here. Give me a small sum of money and let me go.\" \"Money!\" screeched the miser, touched on his tenderest point. \"Money to waste?\" \"Money to keep me in London until I can obtain a situation as a governess or as a companion. Come, father,\" she went on coaxingly, \"you must be sick of seeing me about here. And I am so tired of this life!\" \"It\u0027s the wickedness in your blood, Beatrice. Just like your mother--oh, dear me, how very like your mother!\" \"Leave my mother\u0027s character alone!\" said Beatrice impatiently, \"she is dead and buried.\" \"She is--in Hurstable churchyard, under a beautiful tomb I got second-hand at a bargain. See how I loved her.\" \"You never loved anyone in your life, Mr. Alpenny,\" said the girl, freezing again. Alpenny\u0027s brow grew black, and he looked at her with glittering eyes. \"You are mistaken, child,\" he said, quietly. \"I have loved and lost.\" \"My mother----?\" \"Perhaps,\" said he enigmatically, and passed his hand over his bald head in a weary manner. Then he burst out unexpectedly: \"I wish I had never set eyes on your mother. I wish she had been dead and buried before she crossed my path!\" \"She is dead, so----\" \"Yes, she is dead, stone dead,\" he snarled, rising, much agitated, \"and don\u0027t think you\u0027ll ever see her again. If I----\" He was about to speak further; then seeing from the wondering look on the girl\u0027s face that he was saying more than was wise, he halted, stuttered, and sat down again abruptly, moving the papers with trembling hands. \"Leave the past alone,\" he said hoarsely. \"I can\u0027t speak of it calmly. It is the past that makes the future,\" he continued, drumming feverishly on the table with his fingers, \"the past that makes the future.\" Beatrice wondered what he meant, and noticed how weary and worn and nervous he seemed. The man did not love her; he had not treated her as he should have done; and between them there was no feeling in common. Yet he was old, and, after all, had sheltered her in his own grudging way, so Beatrice laid a light hand on his arm. \"Mr. Alpenny, you are not young----\" \"Eighty and more, my dear.\" The term startled her, and she began to think he must indeed be near the borders of the next world when he spoke so gently. \"Well, then, why don\u0027t you go to church, and feed the hungry, and clothe the naked? Remember, you have to answer for what you have done, some day soon.\" Alpenny rose vehemently and flung off her arm. \"I don\u0027t ask you to teach me my duty, girl,\" he said savagely. \"What I have done is done, and was rightly done. Everyone betrayed me, and money is the only thing that did not. Money is power, money is love, money is joy and life and hope and comfort to me. No! I keep my money until I die, and then----\" He cast a nervous look round, only to burst out again with greater vehemence. \"Why do you talk of death? I am strong; I eat heartily. I drink little. I sleep well. I shall live for many a long day yet. And even if I die,\" he snapped, \"don\u0027t expect to benefit by my death. You don\u0027t get that!\" and he snapped his fingers within an inch of her nose. \"I don\u0027t want your money,\" said Beatrice quietly; \"Durban will look after me. Still, you might let me have enough to keep me while I try to find work.\" \"I won\u0027t!\" \"But if you die, I\u0027ll be a pauper.\" \"Without a sixpence!\" said Alpenny exultingly. \"Have I no relatives who will help me?\" \"No. Your mother came from I know not where, and where she has gone I don\u0027t exactly know. She married me and then died. I have kept you----\" \"Yes--yes. But if my mother was poor and came from where you knew not, why did you marry her?\" \"My kind heart----\" \"You haven\u0027t got one; it\u0027s in your money-chest\" \"It might be in a woman\u0027s keeping, which is a much worse place.\" Beatrice grew weary of this futile conversation, and rose. \"You asked me to see you,\" she said, with a fatigued air; \"what is it you have to say?\" \"Oh yes.\" He seemed to arouse himself from a fit of musing. \"Yes! I have found a husband for you.\" Beatrice started. He announced this startling fact as though it were the most natural thing in the world. \"You--have--found--a--husband--for--me?\" she drawled slowly. \"Yes. You won\u0027t have my money, and I may die.\" He cast a look over his shoulder nervously. \"I don\u0027t want to, but I may: one never knows, do they? You will be poor, so I think it best to get you married and settled in life.\" \"Thank you,\" she returned icily. \"It is very good of you to take so much trouble. And my future husband?\" \"Ruck! Major Ruck--Major Simon Ruck, a retired army officer, and a handsome man of fifty, very well preserved, and with a fine fortune.\" \"How alluring! And suppose I refuse?\" \"You can\u0027t--you daren\u0027t!\" He grasped her arm entreatingly. \"Don\u0027t be a fool, my dear. Ruck is handsome and well off. He is coming down on Saturday to see you. This is Wednesday, so you will have time to think over the matter. You must marry him--you must, I tell you!\" and he shook her arm in his agitation. Beatrice removed her arm in a flaming temper. \"Must I indeed?\" said she, flashing up into righteous anger. \"Then I won\u0027t!\" \"Beatrice!\" \"I won\u0027t. I have never seen the man, and I don\u0027t wish to see him. You have no right to make any arrangements about my marriage without consulting me. You are neither kith nor kin of mine, and I am of age. I deny your right to arrange my future.\" \"Do you wish to be left to starve?\" \"I shall not starve; but I would rather do so, than marry a man of fifty, whom I have never set eyes on.\" \"If you don\u0027t marry Ruck, you\u0027ll be a pauper sooner than you expect, my girl. Marry him for my sake?\" \"No! You have done as little as you could for me: you have always hated me. I decline.\" Alpenny rose in his turn--Beatrice had already risen to her feet--and faced her in a black fury, the more venomous for being quiet. \"You shall marry him!\" \"I shall not.\" They faced one another, both angry, both determined, both bent upon gaining the victory. But if Alpenny had an iron will, Beatrice had youth and outraged womanhood on her side, and in the end his small cruel eyes fell before her flashing orbs. \"I want you to marry Ruck--really I do,\" he whimpered piteously. \"Why?\" \"Because\"---- he swallowed something, and told what was evidently a lie, so glibly did it slip out. \"Because I should be sorry to leave you to starve.\" \"I shall not starve. I am well educated, and can teach. At the worst I can become a nursery governess, or be a companion.\" \"Better marry Major Ruck.\" \"No. It is foolish of you to ask me.\" \"If you don\u0027t marry him I shall be ruined. I shall be killed. No\"--he broke off suddenly--\"I don\u0027t mean that. Who would kill a poor old man such as I am? But\"--his voice leaped an octave--\"you must marry the husband I chose for you.\" \"I chose for myself.\" \"Ah!\"--the miser was shaking with rage--\"it\u0027s Vivian Paslow: no denial--I can see he is the man; a penniless scoundrel, who is at my mercy!\" \"Don\u0027t dare to speak of him like that,\" flamed out Beatrice. \"As to marrying him--he has not asked me yet.\" \"And never will, if I can stop him. I know how to do so--oh yes, I do. He will not dare to go against me. I can ruin him. He----\" At this moment there came a sharp rap at the door, which made Alpenny\u0027s face turn white and his lips turn blue. \"Who is there?\" \"A telegram,\" said the voice of Durban; and Alpenny, with a smothered ejaculation of pleasure, went to open the door. As he did so, Beatrice noticed on the wall near the desk two keys, one large and one small. The little one she knew to be the key of the postern gate, and without hesitation she took it down and slipped it into her pocket. As Alpenny turned round with the telegram and no very pleasant expression of countenance, she felt that she would at least be able to see Vivian Paslow on that evening without arousing the suspicions of her stepfather. It was unlikely that any one would come that night, and he would not miss the key, which she could get Durban to replace the next day. As this thought flashed into her mind, she saw the face of the servant at the door. He looked puzzled, but probably that was because he beheld her in the sanctum of his master, hitherto forbidden ground both to him and to her. The next moment Alpenny had closed the door, and Durban went away. \"This telegram is from Major Ruck,\" said Alpenny. \"He is coming down on Saturday, so be ready to receive him.\" \"I shall leave the place if he comes.\" \"You won\u0027t: you\u0027ll wait and see him--and accept him also. If you don\u0027t, I\u0027ll make things hot for Vivian Paslow.\" This was, as Beatrice conceived, a game of bluff; so she replied boldly enough, \"Mr. Paslow is able to look after himself. I decline to speak to Major Ruck, whosoever he may be, or even to see him.\" \"Saturday! Saturday!\" said Alpenny coldly, and opened the door. \"Now you can go. If you leave The Camp, or if you refuse Ruck as your husband, Vivian Paslow will reap the reward of his crimes.\" And he pushed her out, locking the door after her with a sharp click. Crimes! Beatrice stood in the sunlight, stunned and dazed. What did Alpenny mean? What crimes could the man she loved have committed? Almost before she could collect her thoughts she felt a light touch on her shoulder, and turned to behold Durban. \"Wasn\u0027t master in his counting-house all this afternoon?\" asked the servant. \"You should know, missy, as the parlour is opposite.\" \"Yes, he was,\" she replied with an effort. \"I never saw him come out.\" Durban wrinkled his dark brows. \"Then how did he send the telegram, to which he has just now had an answer?\" he demanded. \"How do you know that this wire is an answer, Durban?\" \"The reply was prepaid, missy. How did master do it?\" Beatrice was equally puzzled. Alpenny had not been away from The Camp all the afternoon, yet had contrived to send a telegram, and prepay the reply.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1854/53692.html","bookId":967,"book":{"id":967,"title":"The Black Patch","description":"简介： Of course he\u0027s a wretch, dear; but oh!--with an ecstatic expression--what a nice wretch!I see; you marry the adjective....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1854","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:04 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:04 AM"}}
