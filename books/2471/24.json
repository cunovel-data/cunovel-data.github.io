{"id":82451,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"XXIII - High Noon in Zephyr\n MY NOSE WaSN\u0027T BROKEN, THOUGH IT SWELLED UP LIKE a MELON and turned a ghastly purplish-green and my eyes puffed up into black-and-blue slits. To say Mom was horrified about the whole experience is like saying the Gulf of Mexico has some water in it. But I survived, and I was all right after my nose shrank to its regular size.\n Sheriff amory, who\u0027d been called by Miss Grace, found Lainie and me walking back to Zephyr on Route Sixteen. I didn\u0027t have much to say to him, because I remembered Donny yelling that the Blaylocks owned him. I told Dad about this when he and Mom came to pick me up at Dr. Parrish\u0027s office. Dad didn\u0027t say anything, but I could see the thundercloud settling over his head and I knew he wouldn\u0027t let it lie.\n Miss Grace was okay. She had to be taken to the hospital in Union Town, but the bullet hadn\u0027t hit anything that couldn\u0027t be fixed. I had the feeling that it would take an awful lot to put Miss Grace down for the count.\n This was the story about Lainie and Little Stevie Cauley, as I learned later from Dad, who found it out from the sheriff: Lainie, who\u0027d run away from home when she was seventeen, had met Donny Blaylock while she was a stripper at the Port Said in Birmingham. He had convinced her to come work for his family\u0027s \"business,\" promising her all sorts of big money and stuff, saying the air Force boys really knew how to part with a paycheck. She came, but soon after she arrived at Miss Grace\u0027s, she\u0027d met Little Stevie when she\u0027d gone to the Woolworth\u0027s in Zephyr to buy her summer wardrobe. Maybe it hadn\u0027t been love at first sight, but something close to it. anyhow, Little Stevie had been encouraging Lainie to leave Miss Grace\u0027s and straighten up her act. They\u0027d started talking about getting married. Miss Grace had been in favor of it, because she didn\u0027t want any girl working for her who couldn\u0027t put her all into the job. But Donny Blaylock fancied himself to be Lainie\u0027s boyfriend. He hated Little Stevie anyway because as much as Donny wanted to deny it, Midnight Mona could leave Big Dick dragging. He\u0027d decided the only way to keep Lainie working was to get Stevie out of the picture. The crash and burning of Midnight Mona had been the wreck of Lainie\u0027s dreams as well, and from that point on she didn\u0027t care about what she did, with who, or where. as Miss Grace had said, Lainie had gotten as rough as a cob.\n The last I heard of Lainie, she was going home, older and wiser.\n Sadder, too.\n But who ever said everybody gets a happy endingi\n Some of this information came right from the jackass\u0027s mouth. Donny was behind bars in the Zephyr jail, which stood next to the courthouse. He\u0027d been found, dancing with a scarecrow, by a farmer with a very large shotgun. The sight of iron bars in front of his face had squared up some of Donny\u0027s raggedy edges, and he had come out of his madness long enough to admit running Little Stevie off the road. It was clear that this time a Blaylock was not going to escape the long arm of the law, even if the hand on that arm was dirty with Blaylock cash.\n November had touched the yards of Zephyr with frosty fingers. The hills had gone brown, the leaves falling. They crackled like little fireworks when somebody came up the walk. We heard them on a Tuesday evening, when a fire burned in our hearth, Dad was reading the newspaper, and Mom was poring over her cookbooks for new pie and cake recipes.\n Dad answered the door when the knock sounded. Sheriff Junior Talmadge amory stood under the porch light, his long-jawed face sullen and his hat in his hand. He had the collar of his jacket turned up; it was cold out there.\n \"Can I come in, Tomi\" he asked.\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Dad said.\n \"I\u0027d understand if you didn\u0027t care to talk to me anymore. I\u0027d take it like a man. But... I sure would like to have my say about some things.\"\n Mom stepped up beside my father. \"Let him in, Tom. all righti\"\n Dad opened the door, and the sheriff came in from the night.\n \"Hi, Cory,\" he said to me. I was on the floor next to the fireplace, doing my alabama history homework. a certain area where Rebel used to lounge in the hearth\u0027s glow seemed awfully empty. But life went on.\n \"Hi,\" I said.\n \"Cory, go to your room,\" Dad instructed, but Sheriff amory said, \"Tom, I\u0027d like for him to hear me out, too, seein\u0027 as he was the one found out and all.\"\n I stayed where I was. Sheriff amory sank his slim Ichabod Crane body onto the couch and put his hat on the coffee table. He sat staring at the silver star that adorned it. Dad sat down again, and Mom-ever the hospitable one-asked the sheriff if he\u0027d like some apple pie or spice cake but he shook his head. She sat down, too, her chair and Dad\u0027s bracketing the fireplace.\n \"I won\u0027t be sheriff very much longer,\" Sheriff amory began. \"Mayor Swope\u0027s gonna appoint a new man as soon as he can decide on one. I figure I\u0027ll be done with it by the middle of the month.\" He sighed heavily. \"I expect we\u0027ll be leavin\u0027 town before December.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry to hear it,\" Dad told him. \"But I was sorrier to hear what Cory had to tell me. I guess I can\u0027t kick you around too much, though. You could\u0027ve lied when I came to you about it.\"\n \"I wanted to. Real bad. But if you can\u0027t believe your own son, who in the world can you believei\"\n Dad scowled. He looked as if he wanted to spit a foul taste from his mouth. \"For God\u0027s sake, why\u0027d you do it, J.T.i Takin\u0027 money from the Blaylocks to shield \u0027emi Lookin\u0027 the other way when they sold their \u0027shine and suckered people into that crooked gamblin\u0027 deni Not to mention Miss Grace\u0027s house, and I like and respect Miss Grace but God knows she oughta be in some other line of work. What else did you do for Biggun Blaylocki Polish his bootsi\"\n \"Yes,\" the sheriff said.\n \"Yes whati\"\n \"I did. Polish his boots.\" Sheriff amory gave a wan, tired smile. His eyes were black holes of sadness and regret. His smile slipped off, leaving his mouth twisted with pain. \"I always went to Biggun\u0027s house to get my money. He had it for me, first day of the month. Two hundred dollars in a white envelope with my name on it. \u0027Sheriff Junior.\u0027 That\u0027s what he calls me.\" He winced a little at the thought. \"When I went in that day, all the boys were there: Donny, Bodean, and Wade. Biggun was oilin\u0027 a rifle. Even sittin\u0027 in a chair, he can fill up a room. He can look at you and knock you down. I picked up my envelope, and all of a sudden he reaches to the floor and puts his muddy boots on the table, and he says, \u0027Sheriff Junior, I\u0027ve got me a mess here to clean up and I don\u0027t rightly feel up to doin\u0027 it. You think you could clean \u0027em for mei\u0027 and I started to say no, but he takes a fifty-dollar bill out of his shirt pocket and he puts it down inside one of them big boots, and he says, \u0027Make it worth your while, of course.\u0027\"\n \"Don\u0027t tell me this, J.T.,\" Dad said.\n \"I want to. I have to.\" The sheriff peered into the fire, and I could see the flames make light and shadows ripple across his face. \"I told Biggun I had to go, that I couldn\u0027t be cleanin\u0027 anybody\u0027s boots. and he grins and says, \u0027aw, Sheriff Junior, why didn\u0027t you name your price right offi\u0027 and he takes another fifty-dollar bill out of his pocket and he slides it down into the other boot.\" Sheriff amory looked at the fingers of his traitorous right hand. \"My girls needed new clothes,\" he said. \"Needed some Sunday shoes, with bows on \u0027em. Needed somethin\u0027 that wasn\u0027t already worn out by somebody else. So I earned myself an extra hundred dollars. But Biggun knew I\u0027d be comin\u0027 that day, and he... he\u0027d been stompin\u0027 around in filth. When his boots were clean, I went outside and threw up, and I heard the boys laughin\u0027 in the house.\" His eyes squeezed shut for a few seconds, and then they opened again. \"I took my girls to the finest shoestore in Union Town, and I bought Lucinda a bouquet of flowers. It wasn\u0027t just for her; I wanted to smell somethin\u0027 sweet.\"\n \"Did Lucinda know about thisi\" Dad asked.\n \"No. She thought I\u0027d gotten a raise. You know how many times I\u0027ve asked Mayor Swope and that damn town council for a raise, Tomi You know how many times they\u0027ve said, \u0027We\u0027ll put it in the budget next year, J.T.\u0027i\" He gave a bitter laugh. \"Good ol\u0027 J.T.! Ol\u0027 J.T. can make do, or do without! He can stretch a dime until Roosevelt hollers, and he don\u0027t need no raise because what does he do all dayi Ol\u0027 J.T. drives around in his sheriff\u0027s car and he sits behind his desk readin\u0027 True Detective and he maybe breaks up a fight now and then or chases down a lost dog or keeps two neighbors from squabblin\u0027 over a busted fence. Every blue moon there\u0027s a robbery, or a shootin\u0027, or somethin\u0027 like that car goin\u0027 down into Saxon\u0027s Lake. But it\u0027s not like good ol\u0027 harmless J.T.\u0027s a real sheriff, don\u0027t you seei He\u0027s just kind of a long, slumpy thing with a star on his hat, and nothin\u0027 much ever happens in Zephyr that he should be gettin\u0027 a raise, or a half-decent gasoline allowance, or a bonus every once in a while. Or maybe a pat on the back.\" His eyes glittered with feverish anger. I realized, as my parents did, that we had not known Sheriff amory\u0027s hidden anguish. \"Damn,\" he said. \"I didn\u0027t mean to come in here and spill all my belly juice like this. I\u0027m sorry.\"\n \"If you felt this way so long,\" Mom said, \"why didn\u0027t you just quiti\"\n \"Because... I liked bein\u0027 the sheriff, Rebecca. I liked knowin\u0027 who was doin\u0027 what to who, and why. I liked havin\u0027 people depend on me. It was... like bein\u0027 a father and big brother and best friend all rolled up into one. Maybe Mayor Swope and the town council don\u0027t respect me, but the people of Zephyr do. Did, I mean. That\u0027s why I kept at it, even though I should\u0027ve walked away from it a long time ago. Before Biggun Blaylock called me in the middle of the night and said he had a proposition for me. Said his businesses don\u0027t hurt anybody. Said they make people feel better. Said he wouldn\u0027t be in business to begin with if people didn\u0027t come lookin\u0027 for what he was sellin\u0027.\"\n \"and you believed him. My God, J.T.!\" Dad shook his head in disgust.\n \"There was more. Biggun said if he and his boys weren\u0027t in business, the Ryker gang would move in from the next county, and I\u0027ve heard those fellas are stone-cold killers. Biggun said that by acceptin\u0027 his money I might be shakin\u0027 hands with the devil, but the devil I knew was better than the devil I didn\u0027t know. Yeah, I believed him, Tom. I still believe him.\"\n \"So you knew where his hideout was all along. and there you were makin\u0027 everybody believe you couldn\u0027t find hide nor hair of him.\"\n \"That\u0027s right. It\u0027s near where Cory and the boys saw that box change hands. I honestly don\u0027t know what was inside it, but I do know Gerald Hargison and Dick Moultry are Klansmen from way back. But now I\u0027m a sinner and slime of the earth and I\u0027m not fit to walk the streets with decent people.\" Sheriff amory directed his hard gaze at my dad. \"I don\u0027t need to be told I\u0027ve messed things up, Tom. I know I was wrong. I know I\u0027ve shamed the office of sheriff. and shamed my family, which is killin\u0027 me when people I thought were our good friends look at Lucinda and the girls like they crawled out of a spittoon. Like I say, we\u0027ll be leavin\u0027 town before long. But I\u0027ve got one last duty to perform as the elected sheriff of Zephyr.\"\n \"What might that bei Openin\u0027 the bank vault for Bigguni\"\n \"No,\" the sheriff said quietly. \"Makin\u0027 sure Donny goes to prison for murder. Manslaughter, at the very least.\"\n \"Oh,\" Dad said, and I know he must\u0027ve felt an inch tall. But he grew back quickly enough. \"What\u0027s Biggun gonna think about thati after he\u0027s been payin\u0027 you to lay offi\"\n \"Biggun didn\u0027t pay me to protect a killer. and that\u0027s what Donny is. I just thank God he didn\u0027t kill Miss Grace, too. I knew Stevie Cauley. He might\u0027ve been a tough guy, and he had his share of scrapes with me, but he was decent. His folks are good people, too. So I\u0027m not gonna let Donny slither out of this, Tom. No matter what Biggun threatens me with.\"\n \"Has he threatened youi\" Mom asked as Dad stood up to shift a fireplace log with the poker.\n \"Yes. Warned me, is more like it.\" Sheriff amory\u0027s brows merged, the lines between his eyes deepening. \"Day after tomorrow, two marshals from the county seat are comin\u0027 on the Trailways bus. It\u0027s bus number thirty-three, and it comes in at noon. I\u0027m to have all the transfer papers ready, and they\u0027re gonna take custody of Donny.\"\n The Trailways bus came through Zephyr every other day, on its way to Union Town. On rare occasions it stopped, under the little Trailways sign at the Shell gas station on Ridgeton Street, to pick up or disgorge a passenger or two. But most days it sped on, going somewhere else.\n \"I found a little black book in a pocket under the driver\u0027s seat of Donny\u0027s car,\" the sheriff explained. Dad fed another log into the fire, but he was listening. \"It\u0027s got names and numbers in it that I think have to do with gamblin\u0027 on high school football games. Some names are in there that might surprise you. Not Zephyr people, but names you might know from the newspapers if you keep up with politics. I think the Blaylocks might have been payin\u0027 a coach or two to throw games.\"\n \"My Lord!\" Mom breathed.\n \"Those two marshals are comin\u0027 to pick up Donny, and I\u0027ve gotta make sure he\u0027s there to meet \u0027em.\" Sheriff amory ran a finger along the edge of his star. \"Biggun says he\u0027ll kill me before he lets me put his son on that bus. I figure he means to, Tom.\"\n \"He\u0027s bluffin\u0027!\" Dad said. \"Tryin\u0027 to scare you into lettin\u0027 Donny go!\"\n \"This mornin\u0027 there was somethin\u0027 dead on our front porch. I think... it might\u0027ve been a cat. But it was all chopped to pieces and the blood was smeared everywhere and on our front door was written Donny won\u0027t go in cat\u0027s blood. You should\u0027ve seen the girls\u0027 faces when they saw that mess.\" Sheriff amory lowered his head for a moment, and stared at the floor. \"I\u0027m scared. awful scared. I think Biggun\u0027s gonna try to kill me and spring Donny out of jail before that bus comes in.\"\n \"I\u0027d be more afraid those damned snakes would go after Lucinda and the girls,\" Mom said, and I knew she was heated up about it because she hardly ever cursed.\n \"I sent \u0027em to Lucinda\u0027s mother this mornin\u0027, after what happened. She called me around two o\u0027clock, said they\u0027d gotten there fine.\" He lifted his face and looked at my father with a tortured expression. \"I need help, Tom.\"\n Sheriff amory went on to explain that he needed three or four men to deputize, and that they\u0027d all spend tonight, tomorrow, and tomorrow night at the jail guarding Donny.\n He said he\u0027d deputized Jack Marchette, who was at the jail pulling guard duty right this minute, but that he was having trouble finding anybody else. He\u0027d asked ten men, he said, and been turned down ten times. It would be dangerous work, he said. The deputies would each get fifty dollars out of his own pocket, and that was all he could afford to pay. But there were pistols and ammunition at the jailhouse, and the jailhouse itself was as firm as a fortress. The tricky part, he said, would be taking Donny from his cell to the bus stop.\n \"That\u0027s the story.\" Sheriff amory gripped his bony knees. \"Can I deputize you, Tomi\"\n \"No!\" Mom\u0027s voice almost shook the windows. \"are you out of your mindi\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry to have to ask this of Tom, Rebecca. I swear I am. But it\u0027s got to be done.\"\n \"ask somebody else, then! Not Tom!\"\n \"Can I get your answeri\" the sheriff urged.\n Dad stood next to the fireplace, the logs crackling. His eyes went from Sheriff amory to Mom and back again, with a quick dart toward me. He slid his hands into his pockets, his face downcast. \"I... don\u0027t know what to say.\"\n \"You know what\u0027s right, don\u0027t youi\"\n \"I do. But I know I don\u0027t believe in violence. I can\u0027t stand the thought of it. Especially... not the way I\u0027ve been feelin\u0027 for the last few months. Like I\u0027m walkin\u0027 on eggshells with an anvil strapped to my back. I know I couldn\u0027t pull a trigger and shoot anybody. I know that for a fact.\"\n \"You wouldn\u0027t have to carry a gun, then. I wouldn\u0027t expect you to. Just be there to show Biggun he can\u0027t get away with murder.\"\n \"Unless the Blaylocks murder all of you!\" Mom fairly leaped from her chair. \"No! Tom\u0027s been under a lot of stress lately, and he\u0027s not in any physical or mental shape to-\"\n \"Rebecca!\" Dad snapped. She hushed. \"I can speak for myself, thank you,\" he said.\n \"Just tell me yes, Tom.\" Sheriff amory was pleading now. \"That\u0027s all I want to hear.\"\n Dad was in pain. I could see its grim mark on his face. He did know what was right, but he was all twisted up and hurting inside, and the chilly hand of the man at the bottom of Saxon\u0027s Lake clutched the back of his neck. \"No,\" he said, his voice raspy. \"I can\u0027t, J.T.\"\n May I be forgiven. I thought one word, and that word was Yellowstreak. Immediately I was overcome with shame, and my face was burning as I got up and ran to my room.\n \"Cory!\" Dad called. \"Wait a minute!\"\n \"Well, that\u0027s just fine!\" Sheriff amory stood up, and he plucked his hat from the coffee table and jammed it on his head. The crown was crushed, the silver star awry. \"Just damn fine! Everybody wants the Blaylocks put behind bars and they kick my ass for takin\u0027 his dirty money, but when it comes a chance to actually do somethin\u0027 about \u0027em, everybody and their brother, sister, and uncle runs for the hills! Just damned fine!\"\n Dad said, \"I wish I could-\"\n \"Forget it. Stay home. Stay safe. Good night.\" Sheriff amory walked out the door into the cold. The leaves crunched under his shoes, the sound fading. Dad stood at the window and watched him drive away.\n \"Don\u0027t worry about him,\" Mom said. \"He\u0027ll find enough deputies.\"\n \"What if he doesn\u0027ti What if everybody does run for the hillsi\"\n \"Then if this town doesn\u0027t care enough about law and order to help their sheriff, Zephyr deserves to dry up and blow away.\"\n Dad turned toward her, his mouth a tight line. \"We\u0027re Zephyr, Rebecca. You and me. Cory. J.T. The ten men he asked who turned him down, they\u0027re Zephyr, too. It\u0027s people\u0027s souls and caring for each other that dries up and blows away before buildin\u0027s and houses do.\"\n \"You can\u0027t help him, Tom. You just can\u0027t. If somethin\u0027 happened to you...\" She didn\u0027t finish, because that train of thought led to a desolate destination.\n \"Maybe he did wrong, but he deserves help. I should\u0027ve said I would.\"\n \"No, you shouldn\u0027t have. You\u0027re not a fighter, Tom. Those Blaylocks would kill you before you could blink.\"\n \"Then maybe I shouldn\u0027t blink,\" Dad said, his face stony.\n \"Just do what J.T. said, Tom. Stay home and stay safe. Okayi\"\n \"Fine example I\u0027m settin\u0027 for Cory. Did you see the way he looked at mei\"\n \"He\u0027ll get over it,\" Mom said. She made an effort to summon a smile. \"How about a nice piece of spice cake and a cup of coffeei\"\n \"I don\u0027t want any spice cake. I don\u0027t want any apple pie, or coconut muffins, or blueberry fritters. all I want is some-\" He had to stop speaking, but the rush of emotion choked him. Peace might have been the next word he was going to say. \"I\u0027m gonna go talk to Cory,\" he told her, and he came to my room and knocked on the door.\n I let him in. I had to. He was my dad. He sat down on my bed, while I held a Blackhawk comic book close to my face. Before he\u0027d come in, I\u0027d been remembering something Vernon had said: Sheriff amory\u0027s a good man, just not a good sheriff. He lets the birds fly when he\u0027s got his paws on them. I guess it could never be said that Sheriff amory wasn\u0027t trying to do well by his family. Dad cleared his throat. \"Well, I reckon I\u0027m lower than a snake\u0027s pecker, is that righti\"\n I would\u0027ve laughed at that any other time. I just stared at my comic book, attempting to climb inside the world of sleek ebony airplanes and square-jawed heroes who used their wits and fists for justice.\n Maybe I betrayed myself somehow. Maybe Dad had an instant of reading my mind. He said, \"The world\u0027s not a comic book, son.\" Then he touched my shoulder, and he stood up and closed the door on his way out.\n I had a bad sleep that night. If it wasn\u0027t the four girls calling my name, it was the car going over the red rock cliff into black water, and then Midnight Mona raced through me and Biggun Blaylock\u0027s demonic, bearded face said I threw in an extra for good luck and Lucifer\u0027s shotgun-ripped head screamed from his grave and Mrs. Lezander offered me a glass of Tang and said Sometimes he stays up until dawn listening to the foreign countries.\n I lay staring into darkness.\n I hadn\u0027t told Dad or Mom about Dr. Lezander\u0027s distaste for milk or his liking to be a night owl. Surely that had nothing to do with the car in Saxon\u0027s Lake. What earthly reason would Dr. Lezander have to kill a strangeri and Dr. Lezander was a kind man who loved animals, not a savage beast who had beaten a man half to death and then strangled the other half with a piano wire. It was unthinkable!\n Yet I was thinking it.\n Vernon had been right about Sheriff amory. Could he be right about the milk-hating night owl, tooi\n Vernon was crazy, but like the Beach Boys, he got around. Like the eye of God, he watched the comings and goings of the citizens of Zephyr, saw their grand hopes and mean schemes. He saw life laid bare. and maybe he was aware of more than he even knew.\n I decided. I was going to have to start watching Dr. Lezander. and Mrs. Lezander, too. How could he be such a monster under his civilized skin, and her not know iti\n The next day, which was cold and drizzly, I pedaled Rocket past Dr. Lezander\u0027s after school. Of course he and his wife were both inside. Even the two horses were in the barn. I don\u0027t know what I was looking for, I just wanted to look. There had to be more to tie the doctor to Saxon\u0027s Lake than Vernon\u0027s theories. That night, the silence at the dinner table couldn\u0027t have been cleaved with a chain saw. I didn\u0027t trust myself to meet Dad\u0027s gaze, and Dad and Mom were avoiding looking at each other as well. So it was a merry dinner, all around.\n Then, as we were eating the pumpkin pie that we were all getting so heartily sick of, Dad said, \"They let Rick Spanner go today.\"\n \"Ricki He\u0027s been with Green Meadows as long as you!\"\n \"That\u0027s right,\" Dad said, and he picked at the crust with his fork. \"Talkin\u0027 to Neil Yarbrough this mornin\u0027. He hears they\u0027re cuttin\u0027 back. Have to, because of that damn... that supermarket,\" he corrected himself, though his curse was already flying. \"Big Paul\u0027s Pantry.\" He snorted so hard I thought pumpkin pie might come through his nose. \"Milk in plastic jugs. What\u0027ll they figure out next to mess things upi\"\n \"Leah Spanner just had a baby in august,\" Mom said. \"That\u0027s their third one. What\u0027s Rick gonna doi\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. He left as soon as they told him. Neil says he heard they gave him a month\u0027s pay, but that won\u0027t go very far with four mouths to feed.\" He put down his fork. \"Maybe we can take \u0027em a pie or somethin\u0027.\"\n \"I\u0027ll make a fresh one first thing in the mornin\u0027.\"\n \"That\u0027d be good.\" Dad reached out, and he placed his hand over Mom\u0027s. With all that had been going on-said and left unsaid-it was a heartening sight. \"I have a feelin\u0027 that\u0027s just the start of it, Rebecca. Green Meadows can\u0027t compete with those supermarket prices. We cut our rates for our regular customers last week, and then Big Paul\u0027s Pantry undercut us two days later. I think it\u0027s gonna get a whole lot worse before it gets any better.\" I saw his hand squeeze Mom\u0027s, and she squeezed back. They were in it together, for the long haul.\n \"One other thing.\" Dad paused. His jaw clenched and relaxed. He was obviously having a hard time spitting this out, whatever it was. \"I talked to Jack Marchette this afternoon. He was at the Shell station when I stopped to fill up the truck. He said-\" again, this was a thorny obstruction in his throat. \"He said J.T.\u0027s only found one more volunteer deputy other than Jack himself. You know who that isi\"\n Mom waited.\n \"The Moon Man.\" a tight smile flickered across Dad\u0027s face. \"Can you believe thati Out of all the able-bodied men in this town, only Jack and the Moon Man are gonna stand with J.T. against the Blaylocks. I doubt if the Moon Man can even hold a pistol, much less use one if he had to! Well, I suppose everybody else decided to stay home and be safe, don\u0027t youi\"\n Mom pulled her hand away, and she looked somewhere else. Dad stared across the table at me, his eyes so intense I had to shift in my chair because I felt their heat and power. \"Some father you\u0027ve got, huh, partneri You go to school today and tell your friends how I helped uphold the lawi\"\n \"No sir,\" I answered.\n \"You should have. Should\u0027ve told Ben, Johnny, and Davy Ray.\"\n \"I don\u0027t see their fathers linin\u0027 up to get themselves killed by the Blaylocks!\" Mom said, her voice strained and unsteady. \"Where are the people who know how to use gunsi Where are the huntersi Where\u0027re the big-talkin\u0027 men who say they\u0027ve been in so many fights and they know how to use their fists and guns to solve every problem in this whole wide worldi\"\n \"I don\u0027t know where they are.\" Dad scraped his chair back and stood up. \"I just know where I am.\" He started walking toward the front door, and Mom said with a frightened gasp of breath, \"Where\u0027re you goin\u0027i\"\n Dad stopped. He stood there, between us and the door, and he lifted a hand to his forehead. \"Out to the porch. Just out to the porch, Rebecca. I need to sit out there and think.\"\n \"It\u0027s cold and rainin\u0027 outside!\"\n \"I\u0027ll live,\" he told her, and he left the house.\n But he came back, in about thirty minutes. He sat before the fireplace and warmed himself. I got to stay up a little later, since it was a Friday night. When it was time for me to go to bed, between ten-thirty and eleven, Dad was still sitting in his chair before the hearth, his hands folded together and supporting his chin. a wind had kicked up outside, and it blew rain like handfuls of grit against the windows.\n \"Good night, Mom!\" I said. She said good night, from her Herculean labors in the kitchen. \"Good night, Dad.\"\n \"Coryi\" he said softly.\n \"Yes siri\"\n \"If I had to kill a man, would that make me any different from whoever did that murder at Saxon\u0027s Lakei\"\n I thought about this for a moment. \"Yes sir,\" I decided. \"Because you\u0027d only kill to protect yourself.\"\n \"How do we know whoever did that murder wasn\u0027t protectin\u0027 himself in some way, tooi\"\n \"We don\u0027t, I guess. But you wouldn\u0027t get any pleasure from it, like he did.\"\n \"No,\" he said. \"I sure wouldn\u0027t.\"\n I had something else to say. I didn\u0027t know if he wanted to hear it or not, but I had to say it. \"Dadi\"\n \"Yes, soni\"\n \"I don\u0027t think anybody gives you peace, Dad. I think you have to fight for it, whether you want to or not. Like what happened with Johnny and Gotha Branlin. Johnny wasn\u0027t lookin\u0027 for a fight. It was forced on him. But he won peace for all of us, Dad.\" My father\u0027s expression didn\u0027t alter, and I wasn\u0027t sure he understood what I was driving at. \"Does that make any sensei\"\n \"Perfect sense,\" he replied. He lifted his chin, and I saw the edge of a smile caught in the corner of his mouth. \"alabama game\u0027s on the radio tomorrow. Ought to be a humdinger. You\u0027d better get on to bed.\"\n \"Yes sir.\" I started toward my room.\n \"Thank you, son,\" my father said.\n I awakened at seven o\u0027clock to the clatter of the pickup truck\u0027s cold engine starting. \"Tom!\" I heard my mother calling from the front porch. \"Tom, don\u0027t!\" I peered out the window into the early sunlight to see Mom in her robe, running to the street. But the pickup truck was already moving away, and Mom cried out, \"Don\u0027t go!\" Dad\u0027s hand emerged from the driver\u0027s window, and he waved. Dogs barked up and down Hilltop Street, roused from their doghouses by the commotion. I knew where Dad was going. I knew why.\n I was scared for him, but during the night he had made a momentous decision. He was going to find peace, rather than waiting for it to find him.\n That morning was an exercise in torture. Mom could hardly speak. She stumbled around in her robe, her eyes glazed with terror. Every fifteen minutes or so she called the sheriff\u0027s office to talk to Dad, until finally around nine o\u0027clock he must\u0027ve told her he couldn\u0027t talk anymore because she didn\u0027t dial the number again.\n at nine-thirty, I got dressed. Pulled on my jeans, a shirt, and a sweater, because though the sun was bright and the sky blue the air was stinging cold. I brushed my teeth and combed my hair. I watched the clock tick toward ten. I thought of the Trailways bus, number thirty-three, on its way over the winding roads. Would it be early, late, or right on timei Today such a thing as seconds might mean life or death for my father, the sheriff, Chief Marchette, and the Moon Man. But I pushed thoughts like that aside, as much as I could. They came back, though, evil as poison ivy. I knew near ten-thirty that I would have to go. I would have to be there, to see my father. I could not wait for the telephone call that would say Donny was on the bus with the two marshals, or my father was lying shot by a Blaylock bullet. I would have to go. I strapped on my Timex, and I was ready.\n as eleven o\u0027clock approached, Mom was so nervous she had both the television and the radio on and she was baking three pies at once. The alabama game was just about to start. I didn\u0027t care a damn for it.\n I walked into the pumpkin-and-nutmeg-fumed kitchen, and I said, \"Can I go to Johnny\u0027s, Momi\"\n \"Whati\" She looked at me, wild-eyed. \"Go wherei\"\n \"Johnny\u0027s. The guys are gonna meet there to...\" I glanced at the radio. Rollllll Tide! the crowd was cheering. \"To listen to the game.\" It was a necessary lie.\n \"No. I want you right here with me.\"\n \"I told \u0027em I\u0027d be there.\"\n \"I said...\" Her face flamed with anger. She slammed a mixing bowl down onto the counter. Utensils filmed with pumpkin slid to the floor. Tears sprang to her eyes, and she put a hand over her mouth to hold back a cry of anguish.\n Cool on the outside, hell-roasted in the guts. That was me. \"I\u0027d like to go,\" I said.\n The hand could no longer hold. \"Go on, then!\" Mom shouted, her nerves at last unraveling to reveal the tormented center. \"Go on, I don\u0027t care!\"\n I turned and ran out before the sob that welled up rooted my shoes. as I climbed onto Rocket, I heard a crash from the kitchen. The mixing bowl had met the floor. I started pedaling for Ridgeton Street, the chill biting my ears.\n Rocket was fast that day, as if it sensed impending tragedy. Still, the town lay quiet in its Saturday drowse, the cold having chased all but a few hardy kids indoors and most folks tuned to Bear\u0027s latest triumph. I leaned forward, my chin slicing the wind. Rocket\u0027s tires thrummed over the pavement, and when my shoes lost the pedals the wheels kept turning on their own.\n I reached the gas station just past eleven-fifteen. It had two pumps and an air hose. Inside the office part that connected to a two-stall garage, the gas station\u0027s owner-Mr. Hiram White, an elderly man with a humped back who shambled around his wrenches and engine belts like Quasimodo amid the bells-sat at his desk, his head cocked toward a radio. at one corner of the cinderblock building a yellow tin sign with TRaILWaYS BUS SYSTEM on it hung from rusted screws. I parked Rocket around back, near the oily trash cans, and I sat on the ground in the sun to wait the coming of high noon.\n at ten minutes before twelve, my fingernails gnawed to the bone, I heard the sound of cars approaching. I edged around the corner and took a peek. The sheriff\u0027s car pulled in, followed by Dad\u0027s pickup truck. The Moon Man, wearing his top hat, was sitting beside Dad. Chief Marchette was in the passenger seat of the sheriff\u0027s car, and seated behind Sheriff amory was the criminal himself. Donny Blaylock wore a gray uniform and a smirk. Nobody got out. They sat there, both engines rumbling.\n Mr. White emerged from his office, scuttling sideways like a crab. Sheriff amory rolled his window down, and they exchanged some words but I couldn\u0027t hear what was being said. Then Mr. White returned to his office. a few minutes later, he was leaving wearing a grease-stained jacket and a baseball cap. He got into his DeSoto and drove off, blue smoke in his wake like dots and dashes of Morse code.\n The sheriff\u0027s window went back up again. I checked my Timex. It was two minutes before twelve.\n Two minutes later, the bus had not arrived.\n Suddenly a voice behind me said, \"Don\u0027t move, boy.\"\n a hand seized the nape of my neck before I could turn my head. Wiry fingers squeezed so hard my nerves were frozen. The hand pulled me, and I retreated from the building\u0027s corner. Was it Wade or Bodean who had mei Lord, wasn\u0027t there some way to warn my dadi The hand kept pulling me until we were back at the trash cans. Then it let me go, and I turned to see my adversary.\n Mr. Owen Cathcoate said, \"What the damn hell are you doin\u0027 here, boyi\"\n I couldn\u0027t speak. Mr. Cathcoate\u0027s wrinkled, liver-spotted face was topped by a sweat-stained brown cowboy hat, its shape more of a Gabby Hayes than a Roy Rogers. His scraggly yellow-white hair hung untidily over his shoulders. He wore, over his creased black trousers and a mud-colored cardigan sweater, a beige duster that looked more musty than dusty. Its ragged hem hung almost to the ankles of his plain black boots. But this was not what had stolen my voice. The voice stealer was the tooled-leather gunbelt cinched around his slim waist and the skeleton-grip pistol tucked down into its holster on his left side, turned around so the butt faced out. Mr. Cathcoate\u0027s narrow eyes appraised me. \"asked you a question,\" he said.\n \"My dad,\" I managed to say. \"He\u0027s here. To help the sheriff.\"\n \"So he is. That don\u0027t explain why you\u0027re here, though.\"\n \"I just wanted to-\"\n \"Get your head blown offi There\u0027s gonna be some fireworks, if I know what the Blaylocks are made of. Get on that bike and make a trail.\"\n \"The bus is late,\" I said, trying to stall him.\n \"Don\u0027t stall,\" he countered. \"Get!\" He shoved me toward Rocket.\n I didn\u0027t get on. \"No sir. I\u0027m stayin\u0027 with my dad.\"\n \"You want me to whip your tail right this minutei\" The veins stood out in his neck. I expect he could deliver a whipping that would make my father\u0027s seem like a brush with a powder puff. Mr. Cathcoate advanced on me. I took a single step back, and then I decided I wasn\u0027t going any farther.\n Mr. Cathcoate stopped, too, less than three feet from me. a hard-edged smile crossed his mouth. \"Well,\" he said. \"Got some sand in you, don\u0027t youi\"\n \"I\u0027m stayin\u0027 here,\" I told him.\n and then we both heard the sound of a vehicle approaching, and we knew the time for debate was ended. Mr. Cathcoate whirled around and stalked to the building\u0027s corner, the folds of his duster rustling. He stopped and peered furtively around the edge, and I realized I was no longer seeing Mr. Owen Cathcoate.\n I was seeing the Candystick Kid.\n I looked around the corner, too, before Mr. Cathcoate waved me back.\n My heart jumped at what I saw. Not the Trailways bus, but a black Cadillac. It pulled into the gas station and parked at an angle in front of the sheriffs car. I dodged away from Mr. Cathcoate\u0027s restraining hand, and I ran for a pile of used tires near the garage and flopped down on my belly behind them. Now I had a clear view of what was about to happen, and I stayed there despite Mr. Cathcoate motioning me back behind the building\u0027s edge.\n Bodean Blaylock, wearing an open-collared white shirt and a gray suit that shone with slick iridescence, got out from behind the wheel. His hair was cropped in a severe crew cut, his mean mouth twisted into a thin smile. He reached into the car and his hand came out with a pearl-handled revolver. Then Wade Blaylock, his dark hair slicked back and his chin jutting, got out of the passenger side. He was wearing black pants so tight they looked painted on, the sleeves of his blue-checked cowboy-style shirt rolled up to show his slim, tattooed forearms in spite of the chill. He had a shoulder holster with a gun in it, and he pulled a rifle out of the Cadillac with him and quickly cocked it: ka-chunk!\n Then the rear door opened, the Cadillac wobbled, and that big brute heaved himself out. Biggun Blaylock was wearing camouflage-print overalls and a dark brown shirt. He looked like one of the November hills come to life, ripped loose from its bedrock to roll across the earth. He wore a toothy grin, his bald head with its tuft of gray hair gleaming with scalp oil. He breathed hard, winded from the exertion of leaving the car. \"Do it, boys,\" he said between wheezes.\n Wade leveled the rifle. Bodean cocked his pistol. They aimed at the sheriff\u0027s car and started shooting.\n I almost left my skin. The bullets hit the two front tires of Sheriff amory\u0027s car and knocked them flat. Then Wade and Bodean took aim at Dad\u0027s truck even as Dad threw the gearshift into reverse and tried to skid the truck out of danger. It was fruitless; the two front tires blew, and the truck was left lame and rocking on its shocks.\n \"Let\u0027s talk some business, Sheriff Junior!\" Biggun thundered.\n Sheriff amory didn\u0027t get out. Donny\u0027s grinning face was pressed up against the window glass like a kid looking at fresh cakes in a bakery. I glanced over to see what Mr. Cathcoate was doing. But the Candystick Kid wasn\u0027t there anymore.\n \"Bus ain\u0027t comin\u0027 for a while!\" Biggun said. He leaned into the Cadillac\u0027s rear seat and came out holding a double-barreled shotgun in one ham-sized hand and in the other a camouflage shoulder bag. He put the bag on top of the Caddy\u0027s roof, unzipped it, and reached in. \"Funniest damn thing, Sheriff Junior!\" He broke the shotgun open, brought out two shells from the ammo bag, and pushed them in. Then he snapped the weapon shut again. \"Damn bus had two flats \u0027bout six miles down Route Ten! Gonna be hell fixin\u0027 them big mothers!\" He rested his weight against the Caddy, making it groan and sag. \"always hated changin\u0027 tires, myself.\"\n a gun spoke: crack crack!\n The Cadillac\u0027s rear tires exploded. Biggun, for all his bulk, jumped two feet in the air. He made a noise that was a combination of hootenanny yodel and opera aria. Wade and Bodean whirled around. Biggun came down with a concrete-cracking concussion.\n Smoke drifted around a figure that stood behind the Cadillac, next to Mr. White\u0027s parked tow truck. The Candystick Kid was holding his pistol in his right hand.\n \"What the fuckin\u0027 hell of a shit-!\" Biggun raged, his face swelling up with blood and the tip of his beard quivering.\n Sheriff amory jumped from his car. \"Owen! I told you I didn\u0027t want you around here!\"\n The Candystick Kid ignored him, his cool gaze riveted to Biggun. \"Know what this is called, Mr. Blaylocki\" He suddenly spun his pistol around and around his trigger finger, the sun glinting off the blued metal, and he delivered the gun to its butt-first position in the left-sided holster with a shricking noise of supple leather. \"This is called,\" he said, \"a standoff.\"\n \"Standoff, my ass!\" Biggun shouted. \" Nail him, boys!\"\n Wade and Bodean opened fire as Sheriff amory yelled, \"No!\" and brought up the rifle he\u0027d been holding at his side.\n The Candystick Kid might have been an old, wrinkled man, but whatever was in him that had made him the Kid now showed its mettle. He dived behind the tow truck as bullets crashed through the windshield and pocked the hood. Sheriff amory squeezed off two shots, and the Cadillac\u0027s windshield blew out. Wade yelped and went for the ground, but Bodean turned around with fury contorting his face and his pistol popped. Sheriff amory\u0027s hat flew off his head like a pigeon. The next shot from the sheriff\u0027s rifle put a part in the side of Bodean\u0027s crew cut, and Bodean must\u0027ve felt the heat of its passage because he hollered \"Yow!\" and dropped to a snake\u0027s view.\n Mr. Marchette climbed out of the sheriff\u0027s car, holding a pistol. Dad scrambled out of the pickup truck and threw himself to the pavement, and a thrill of mingled pride and fear went through me as I saw he was gripping a gun, too. The Moon Man stayed in the truck and ducked his head, only his top hat showing.\n Boom! the double-barreled shotgun said. The tow truck shook, pieces of glass and metal flying off it. Biggun was on his knees beside the Cadillac, and it came to me that he shouldn\u0027t destroy that tow truck because he was going to need it to stand up again.\n \"Daddy!\" Donny shouted from the sheriff\u0027s car. \"Get me outta this, Daddy!\"\n \"ain\u0027t nobody takin\u0027 what belongs to me!\" Biggun yelled back. He fired off a shell at the sheriff\u0027s car, and the grille exploded. Steaming radiator water spewed like a geyser. From the back seat, where he must\u0027ve been restrained by cuffs or a rope, Donny hollered, \"Don\u0027t kill me \u0027fore you save me, Daddy!\"\n I saw where Donny got his smarts from.\n Biggun reached up and grabbed the ammo bag\u0027s strap, and he hauled it down with him to reload. another bullet smacked into the Cadillac, and a taillight crashed. The Candystick Kid was still at work.\n \"ain\u0027t no use!\" Biggun said, snapping the shotgun shut again. \"We\u0027re gonna go through you like shit through a goose! Hear me, Sheriff Juniori\"\n Dad got up. I almost shouted for him to stay down, but he ran alongside the sheriff\u0027s car and crouched next to Sheriff amory. I could see how pale his face was. But he was there, and that\u0027s what counted.\n There was a lull as everybody got their second gulp of courage. Bodean and Wade began firing at the sheriff\u0027s car again, and Donny hunkered down in the back seat. \"Stop that shootin\u0027, ya damn fools!\" Biggun commanded. \"You wanna blow your brother\u0027s head offi\"\n Maybe it was my imagination, but neither Wade nor Bodean stopped firing as fast as they should have.\n \"Get around behind \u0027em, Wade!\" Bodean yelled.\n \"You get around behind \u0027em, dumb ass!\"\n Bodean, proving the cunning of a poker player did not translate into common sense, stood up and sprinted for the building\u0027s corner. He got about three strides when a single gunshot rang out and he grabbed at his right foot and fell sprawling to the pavement. \"I\u0027m shot, Daddy! Daddy, I\u0027m shot!\" he whined, his pistol lying out of reach.\n \"Didn\u0027t think you were fuckin\u0027 tickled!\" Biggun roared back. \"Lord God, you got the brains of a BB in a boxcar!\"\n \"Gimme somethin\u0027 else to shoot at!\" the Candystick Kid urged, well-hidden in the shadow of the tow truck. \"I got a gun full of lonely bullets!\"\n \"Give it up, Biggun!\" Sheriff amory said. \"You\u0027re washed up around here!\"\n \"If I am, I\u0027ll make you choke on the soap, you bastards!\"\n \"ain\u0027t no use anybody else gettin\u0027 hurt! Throw out your guns and let\u0027s call it quits!\"\n \"Sheeeeyit!\" Biggun snarled. \"You think I got anywhere in this life by callin\u0027 it quitsi You think I come up from hog turds and cotton fields to let a little tin star take my boy away from me and ruin everythin\u0027i You shoulda used that money I been payin\u0027 you to buy a head doctor with!\"\n \"Biggun, it\u0027s over! You\u0027re surrounded!\" That was my father\u0027s voice. To my dying day I shall never forget the steel in it. He was a Blackhawk, after all.\n \"Surround this!\" Wade jumped up and started firing with his rifle in my father\u0027s direction. Biggun hollered for him to get down, but Wade was balanced on the lunatic edge just like Donny. Bullets struck sparks off the concrete, and one of them thunked into a tire in my nest of concealment. My heart seized up, it was so close. Then the Candystick Kid\u0027s gun cracked again, just once, and a chunk of Wade\u0027s left ear spun off his head and red blood spattered the Cadillac\u0027s hood.\n You would\u0027ve thought the bullet had chopped off something more central, because Wade screamed like a woman. He clutched at his ragged ear, fell to the ground, and started wheeling around and around like the Three Stooges\u0027 Curly having a caterwauling fit.\n \"Oh, my soul!\" Biggun moaned.\n It was obvious that, like the Branlins, the Blaylocks could dish it out but they sure couldn\u0027t take it.\n \"Damn, I missed!\" the Candystick Kid said. \"I was aimin\u0027 for his head instead of his ass!\"\n \"I\u0027ll kill ya!\" Biggun\u0027s voice returned to the thunder zone. \" I\u0027ll kill every one of ya and dance on your graves!\"\n It was a frightening sound. But with Bodean and Wade writhing on the pavement and Donny yelping like a sad little puppy, there wasn\u0027t much lightning left in the storm.\n and then the pickup\u0027s passenger-side door opened and the Moon Man stepped out. He was wearing a black suit and a red bow tie, as well as his top hat. around his neck were six or seven strings and attached to the strings were small things that looked like tea bags. a chicken foot was pinned to one lapel, and he wore three watches on each wrist. He didn\u0027t duck or dodge. Instead, he began walking past the sheriff\u0027s car, past Fire Chief Marchette and my dad and Sheriff amory. \"Hey!\" Chief Marchette shouted. \"Get your head down!\"\n But the Moon Man kept going with a deliberate stride, his head held high. He was going right to where Biggun Blaylock crouched by the Cadillac holding a loaded double-barreled shotgun.\n \"Cease this violence!\" the Moon Man intoned in a soft, almost childlike voice. I had never heard him speak before. \"Cease this violence, for the sake of all that\u0027s good!\" His long legs stepped over Wade without hesitation.\n \"Keep away from me, you nutty nigger!\" Biggun warned. But the Moon Man would not be halted. Dad shouted, \"Come back!\" and started to get up, but Sheriff amory\u0027s hand closed on his forearm.\n \"I\u0027ll blow you to voodoo blazes!\" Biggun said, indicating that he indeed knew the reputations of the Moon Man and the Lady. Biggun\u0027s eyes had taken on the wet glint of fear. \"Stay away from me! Stay away, I said!\"\n The Moon Man stopped in front of Biggun. The Moon Man smiled, his eyes crinkling up, and he held out his long, slim arms. \"Let us search for light,\" he said.\n Biggun aimed the shotgun at the Moon Man at point-blank range. He sneered, \"Well, light one for me!\" and his thick finger wrenched both triggers at once.\n I flinched, my eardrums already cracking from the blast.\n But there was no blast.\n \"Stand up and walk like a man,\" the Moon Man said, still smiling. \"It\u0027s not too late.\"\n Biggun gagged and gasped at the same time. He wrenched the triggers again. Still, no blast. Biggun snapped the shotgun open, and what was jammed into the chambers came spilling out over his hands.\n They were little green garden snakes. Dozens of them, all tangled together. Perfectly harmless, but they did some damage to Biggun Blaylock, and that\u0027s no lie.\n \"Gaaaaakkkk!\" he choked. He knocked the snakes out of the chambers, reached into his ammo bag, and his hand came out full of rippling green bodies. Biggun made a noise like Lou Costello coming face-to-face with Lon Chaney Junior\u0027s werewolf-\" Wo wo wo wo wo!\"-and suddenly that monstrous bulk was up on its feet and showed that he might not walk like a man but he sure could run like a rabbit. Of course, in such cases the reality of physics must eventually intrude and Biggun\u0027s weight crashed him to the concrete before he got very far. He struggled and thrashed like a turtle turned on its shell.\n Tires shrieked. a pickup truck loaded with men roared into the gas station. I recognized among them Mr. Wilson and Mr. Callan. Most of the men held baseball bats, axes, or guns. Close behind them came a car, followed by another car. Then a second pickup truck skidded to a stop. The men of Zephyr-and many of the Bruton men, too-leaped out ready to bust some heads. \"I\u0027ll be,\" Sheriff amory said, and he stood up.\n They were sorely disappointed, to say the least, that it was all over. I later learned the noise of the shootout had thawed their guts and brought them out to defend their sheriff and their town. They had all thought, I suppose, that someone else would shoulder the responsibility, that they could stay home and be safe. a lot of wives had done a lot of crying. But they had come. Not all of the Zephyr and Bruton men, by far, but more than enough to take care of business. I imagine that seeing the crowd of wild men with butcher knives, Louisville Sluggers, hatchets, pistols, and meat cleavers, the Blaylocks thanked their lucky stars they weren\u0027t going to jail in snuffboxes.\n In all the confusion, I came out from hiding. Mr. Owen Cathcoate was standing over Wade, lecturing him about the straight and narrow path. Wade was listening with only half an ear. My dad was with the Moon Man, over by the Blaylocks\u0027 Caddy. I walked to him, and he looked at me and wanted to ask what I was doing there, but he didn\u0027t because the answer to that would lead to a whipping. So he didn\u0027t ask, he just nodded.\n Dad and I stood together, staring down at Biggun\u0027s shotgun and the ammo bag. Green garden snakes wriggled around each other like a big mass of seaweed, overflowing from the bag.\n The Moon Man just grinned. \"My wife,\" he said. \"She one craaaaazy old lady.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/boy-s-life/page-24.html","bookId":2471,"book":{"id":2471,"title":"Boy\u0027s Life","description":"Storyline: \n Zephyr, alabama, is an idyllic hometown for eleven-year-old Cory Mackenson -- a place where monsters swim the river deep and friends are forever.
