{"id":82431,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"PaRT ONE - The Shades of Spring Before the Sun Down in the Dark The Invader Wasps at Easter The Death of a Bike Old Moses Comes to Call a Summons from the Lady I - Before the Sun \"CORYi WaKE UP, SON. IT\u0027S TIME.\" I let him pull me up from the dark cavern of sleep, and I opened my eyes and looked up at him. He was already dressed, in his dark brown uniform with his name-Tom-written in white letters across his breast pocket. I smelled bacon and eggs, and the radio was playing softly in the kitchen. a pan rattled and glasses clinked; Mom was at work in her element as surely as a trout rides a current. \"It\u0027s time,\" my father said, and he switched on the lamp beside my bed and left me squinting with the last images of a dream fading in my brain. The sun wasn\u0027t up yet. It was mid-March, and a chill wind blew through the trees beyond my window. I could feel the wind by putting my hand against the glass. Mom, realizing that I was awake when my dad went in for his cup of coffee, turned the radio up a little louder to catch the weather report. Spring had sprung a couple of days before, but this year winter had sharp teeth and nails and he clung to the South like a white cat. We hadn\u0027t had snow, we never had snow, but the wind was chill and it blew hard from the lungs of the Pole. \"Heavy sweater!\" Mom called. \"Heari\" \"I hear!\" I answered back, and I got my green heavy sweater from my dresser. Here is my room, in the yellow lamplight and the space heater rumbling: Indian rug red as Cochise\u0027s blood, a desk with seven mystic drawers, a chair covered in material as velvety blue-black as Batman\u0027s cape, an aquarium holding tiny fish so pale you could see their hearts beat, the aforementioned dresser covered with decals from Revell model airplane kits, a bed with a quilt sewn by a relative of Jefferson Davis\u0027s, a closet, and the shelves. Oh, yes, the shelves. The troves of treasure. On those shelves are stacks of me: hundreds of comic books-Justice League, Flash, Green Lantern, Batman, the Spirit, Blackhawk, Sgt. Rock and Easy Company, aquaman, and the Fantastic Four. There are Boy\u0027s Life magazines, dozens of issues of Famous Monsters of Filmland, Screen Thrills, and Popular Mechanics. There is a yellow wall of National Geographics, and I have to blush and say I know where all the african pictures are. The shelves go on for miles and miles. My collection of marbles gleams in a mason jar. My dried cicada waits to sing again in summer. My Duncan yo-yo that whistles except the string is broken and Dad\u0027s got to fix it. My little book of suit cloth samples that I got from Mr. Parlowe at the Stagg Shop for Men. I use those pieces of cloth as carpet inside my airplane models, along with seats cut from cardboard. My silver bullet, forged by the Lone Ranger for a werewolf hunter. My Civil War button that fell from a butternut uniform when the storm swept Shiloh. My rubber knife for stalking killer crocodiles in the bathtub. My Canadian coins, smooth as the northern plains. I am rich beyond measure. \"Breakfast\u0027s on!\" Mom called. I zipped up my sweater, which was the same hue as Sgt. Rock\u0027s ripped shirt. My blue jeans had patches on the knees, like badges of courage marking encounters with barbed wire and gravel. My flannel shirt was red enough to stagger a bull. My socks were white as dove wings and my Keds midnight black. My mom was color-blind, and my dad thought checks went with plaid. I was all right. It\u0027s funny, sometimes, when you look at the people who brought you into this world and you see yourself so clearly in them. You realize that every person in the world is a compromise of nature. I had my mother\u0027s small-boned frame and her wavy, dark brown hair, but my father had given me his blue eyes and his sharp-bridged nose. I had my mother\u0027s long-fingered hands-an \"artist\u0027s hands,\" she used to tell me when I fretted that my fingers were so skinny-and my dad\u0027s thick eyebrows and the small cleft in his chin. I wished that some nights I would go to sleep and awaken resembling a man\u0027s man like Stuart Whitman in Cimarron Strip or Clint Walker in Cheyenne, but the truth of it was that I was a skinny, gawky kid of average height and looks, and I could blend into wallpaper by closing my eyes and holding my breath. In my fantasies, though, I tracked lawbreakers along with the cowboys and detectives who paraded past us nightly on our television set, and out in the woods that came up behind our house I helped Tarzan call the lions and shot Nazis down in a solitary war. I had a small group of friends, guys like Johnny Wilson, Davy Ray Callan, and Ben Sears, but I wasn\u0027t what you might call popular. Sometimes I got nervous talking to people and my tongue got tangled, so I stayed quiet. My friends and I were about the same in size, age, and temperament; we avoided what we could not fight, and we were all pitiful fighters. This is where I think the writing started. The \"righting,\" if you will. The righting of circumstances, the shaping of the world the way it should have been, had God not had crossed eyes and buck teeth. In the real world I had no power; in my world I was Hercules unchained. One thing I do know I got from my granddaddy Jaybird, my dad\u0027s father: his curiosity about the world. He was seventy-six years old and as tough as beef jerky, and he had a foul mouth and an even fouler disposition, but he was always prowling the woods around his farm. He brought home things that made Grandmomma Sarah swoon: snake-skins, empty hornets\u0027 nests, even animals he\u0027d found dead. He liked to cut things open with a penknife and look at their insides, arranging all their bloody guts out on newspapers. One time he hung up a dead toad from a tree and invited me to watch the flies eat it with him. He brought home a burlap sack full of leaves, dumped them in the front room, and examined each of them with a magnifying glass, writing down their differences in one of his hundreds of Nifty notebooks. He collected cigar butts and dried spits of chewing tobacco, which he kept in glass vials. He could sit for hours in the dark and look at the moon. Maybe he was crazy. Maybe crazy is what they call anybody who\u0027s got magic in them after they\u0027re no longer a child. But Granddaddy Jaybird read the Sunday comics to me, and he told me stories about the haunted house in the small hamlet of his birth. Granddaddy Jaybird could be mean and stupid and petty, but he lit a candle of wonder in me and by that light I could see a long way beyond Zephyr. On that morning before the sun, as I sat eating my breakfast with my dad and mom in our house on Hilltop Street, the year was 1964. There were great changes in the winds of earth, things of which I was unaware. all I knew at that moment was that I needed another glass of orange juice, and that I was going to help my dad on his route before he took me to school. So when breakfast was over and the dishes were cleared, after I had gone out into the cold to say good morning to Rebel and feed him his Gravy Train, Mom kissed both Dad and me, I put on my fleece-lined jacket and got my schoolbooks and off we went in the coughy old pickup truck. Freed from his backyard pen, Rebel followed us a distance, but at the corner of Hilltop and Shawson streets he crossed into the territory of Bodog, the Doberman pinscher that belonged to the Ramseys, and he beat a diplomatic retreat to a drumroll of barks. and there was Zephyr before us, the town quiet in its dreaming, the moon a white sickle in the sky. a few lights were on. Not many. It wasn\u0027t five o\u0027clock yet. The sickle moon glittered in the slow curve of the Tecumseh River, and if Old Moses swam there he swam with his leathery belly kissing mud. The trees along Zephyr\u0027s streets were still without leaves, and their branches moved with the wind. The traffic lights-all four of them at what might be called major intersections-blinked yellow in a steady accord. To the east, a stone bridge with brooding gargoyles crossed the wide hollow where the river ran. Some said the faces of the gargoyles, carved in the early twenties, were representations of various Confederate generals, fallen angels, as it were. To the west, the highway wound into the wooded hills and on toward other towns. a railroad track cut across Zephyr to the north, right through the Bruton area, where all the black people lived. In the south was the public park where a bandshell stood and a couple of baseball diamonds had been cut into the earth. The park was named for Clifford Gray Haines, who founded Zephyr, and there was a statue of him sitting on a rock with his chin resting on his hand. My dad said it looked as if Clifford was perpetually constipated and could neither do his business nor get off the pot. Farther south, Route Ten left Zephyr\u0027s limits and wound like a black cottonmouth past swampy woods, a trailer park, and Saxon\u0027s Lake, which shelved into unknown depths. Dad turned us onto Merchants Street, and we drove through the center of Zephyr, where the stores were. There was Dollar\u0027s Barbershop, the Stagg Shop for Men, the Zephyr Feeds and Hardware Store, the Piggly-Wiggly grocery, the Woolworth\u0027s store, the Lyric theater, and other attractions along the sidewalked thoroughfare. It wasn\u0027t much, though; if you blinked a few times, you were past it. Then Dad crossed the railroad track, drove another two miles, and turned into a gate that had a sign above it: GREEN MEaDOWS DaIRY. The milk trucks were at the loading dock, getting filled up. Here there was a lot of activity, because Green Meadows Dairy opened early and the milkmen had their appointed rounds. Sometimes when my father had an especially busy schedule, he asked me to help him with his deliveries. I liked the silence and stillness of the mornings. I liked the world before the sun. I liked finding out what different people ordered from the dairy. I don\u0027t know why; maybe that was my granddaddy Jaybird\u0027s curiosity in me. My dad went over a checklist with the foreman, a big crew-cut man named Mr. Bowers, and then Dad and I started loading our truck. Here came the bottles of milk, the cartons of fresh eggs, buckets of cottage cheese and Green Meadows\u0027 special potato and bean salads. Everything was still cold from the ice room, and the milk bottles sparkled with frost under the loading dock\u0027s lights. Their paper caps bore the face of a smiling milkman and the words \"Good for You!\" as we were working, Mr. Bowers came up and watched with his clipboard at his side and his pen behind his ear. \"You think you\u0027d like to be a milkman, Coryi\" he asked me, and I said I might. \"The world\u0027ll always need milkmen,\" Mr. Bowers went on. \"Isn\u0027t that right, Tomi\" \"Right as rain,\" my dad said; this was an all-purpose phrase he used when he was only half listening. \"You come apply when you turn eighteen,\" Mr. Bowers told me. \"We\u0027ll fix you up.\" He gave me a clap on the shoulder that almost rattled my teeth and did rattle the bottles in the tray I was carrying. Then Dad climbed behind the big-spoked wheel, I got into the seat next to him, he turned the key, and the engine started and we backed away from the loading dock with our creamy cargo. ahead of us, the moon was sinking down and the last of the stars hung on the lip of night. \"What about thati\" Dad asked. \"Being a milkman, I mean. That appeal to youi\" \"It\u0027d be fun,\" I said. \"Not really. Oh, it\u0027s okay, but no job\u0027s fun every day. I guess we\u0027ve never talked about what you want to do, have wei\" \"No sir.\" \"Well, I don\u0027t think you ought to be a milkman just because that\u0027s what I do. See, I didn\u0027t start out to be a milkman. Granddaddy Jaybird wanted me to be a farmer like him. Grandmomma Sarah wanted me to be a doctor. Can you imagine thati\" He glanced at me and grinned. \"Me, a doctor! Doctor Tom! No sir, that wasn\u0027t for me.\" \"What\u0027d you start out to bei\" I asked. My dad was quiet for a while. He seemed to be thinking this question over, in a deep place. It occurred to me that maybe no one had ever asked him this before. He gripped the spoked wheel with his grown-up hands and negotiated the road that unwound before us in the headlights, and then he said, \"First man on Venus. Or a rodeo rider. Or a man who can look at an empty space and see in his mind the house he wants to build there right down to the last nail and shingle. Or a detective.\" My dad made a little laughing noise in his throat. \"But the dairy needed another milkman, so here I am.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t mind bein\u0027 a race car driver,\" I said. My dad sometimes took me to the stock car races at the track near Barnesboro, and we sat there eating hot dogs and watching sparks fly in the collision of banged-up metal. \"Bein\u0027 a detective would be okay, too. I\u0027d get to solve mysteries and stuff, like the Hardy Boys.\" \"Yeah, that\u0027d be good,\" my dad agreed. \"You never know how things are gonna turn out, though, and that\u0027s the truth. You aim for one place, sure as an arrow, but before you hit the mark, the wind gets you. I don\u0027t believe I ever met one person who became what they wanted to be when they were your age.\" \"I\u0027d like to be everybody in the world,\" I said. \"I\u0027d like to live a million times.\" \"Well\"-and here my father gave one of his sagely nods-\"that would be a fine piece of magic, wouldn\u0027t iti\" He pointed. \"Here\u0027s our first stop.\" That first house must\u0027ve had children in it, because they got two quarts of chocolate milk to go along with their two quarts of plain milk. Then we were off again, driving through the streets where the only sounds were the wind and the barking of early dogs, and we stopped on Shantuck Street to deliver buttermilk and cottage cheese to somebody who must\u0027ve liked things sour. We left bottles glistening on the steps of most of the houses on Bevard Lane, and my dad worked fast as I checked off the list and got the next items ready from the chilly back of the truck; we were a good team. Dad said he had some customers down south near Saxon\u0027s Lake and then he\u0027d swing back up so we could finish the rest of the street deliveries before my school bell rang. He drove us past the park and out of Zephyr, and the forest closed in on either side of the road. It was getting on toward six o\u0027clock. To the east, over the hills of pine and kudzu, the sky was beginning to lighten. The wind shoved its way through the trees like the fist of a bully. We passed a car going north, and its driver blinked the lights and Dad waved. \"Marty Barklee deliverin\u0027 the newspapers,\" Dad told me. I thought about the fact that there was a whole world going about its business before the sun, and people who were just waking up weren\u0027t part of it. We turned off Route Ten and drove up a dirt drive to deliver milk, buttermilk, and potato salad to a small house nestled in the woods, and then we went south toward the lake again. \"College,\" my dad said. \"You ought to go to college, it seems to me.\" \"I guess so,\" I answered, but that sounded like an awful long distance from where I was now. all I knew about college was auburn and alabama football, and the fact that some people praised Bear Bryant and others worshipped Shug Jordan. It seemed to me that you chose which college to go to according to which coach you liked best. \"Gotta have good grades to get into college,\" Dad said. \"Gotta study your lessons.\" \"Do detectives have to go to collegei\" \"I reckon they do if they want to be professional about it. If I\u0027d gone to college, I might\u0027ve turned out to be that man who builds a house in empty space. You never know what\u0027s ahead for you, and that\u0027s the-\" Truth, he was about to say, but he never finished it because we came around a wooded bend and a brown car jumped out of the forest right in front of us and Dad yelped like he was hornet-stung as his foot punched the brake. The brown car went past us as Dad whipped the wheel to the left, and I saw that car go off Route Ten and down the embankment on my right. Its lights weren\u0027t on but there was somebody sitting behind the wheel. The car\u0027s tires tore through the underbrush and then it went over a little cliff of red rock and down into the dark. Water splashed up, and I realized the car had just plunged into Saxon\u0027s Lake. \"He went in the water!\" I shouted, and Dad stopped the milk truck, pulled up the hand brake, and jumped out into the roadside weeds. as I climbed out, Dad was already running toward the lake. The wind whipped and whirled around us, and Dad stood there on the red rock cliff. By the faint pinkish light we could see the car wallowing in the water, huge bubbles bursting around its trunk. \"Hey!\" Dad shouted with his hands cupped around his mouth. \"Get out of there!\" Everybody knew Saxon\u0027s Lake was as deep as sin, and when that car went down into the inky depths it was gone for good and ever. \"Hey, get out!\" Dad shouted again, but whoever was behind the wheel didn\u0027t answer. \"I think he\u0027s been knocked cold!\" Dad told me as he took off his shoes. The car was starting to turn onto its passenger side, and there was an awful howling sound coming from it that must\u0027ve been the rush of water pouring into the car. Dad said, \"Stand back.\" I did, and he leaped into the lake. He was a strong swimmer. He reached the car in a few powerful strokes, and he saw that the driver\u0027s window was open. He could feel the suction of water moving around his legs, drawing the car down into the unfathomed deep. \"Get out!\" he hollered, but the driver just sat there. Dad clung to the door, reached in, and grabbed the driver\u0027s shoulder. It was a man, and he wore no shirt. The flesh was white and cold, and my dad felt his own skin crawl. The man\u0027s head lolled back, his mouth open. He had short-cropped blond hair, his eyes sealed shut with black bruises, his face swollen and malformed from the pressures of a savage beating. around his throat was knotted a copper piano wire, the thin metal pulled so tightly that the flesh had split open. \"Oh Jesus,\" my dad whispered, treading water. The car lurched and hissed. The head lolled forward over the chest again, as if in an attitude of prayer. Water was rising up over the driver\u0027s bare knees. My dad realized the driver was naked, not a stitch on him. Something glinted on the steering wheel, and he saw handcuffs that secured the man\u0027s right wrist to the inner spoke. My dad had lived thirty-four years. He\u0027d seen dead men before. Hodge Klemson, one of his best friends, had drowned in the Tecumseh River when they were both fifteen years old, and the body had been found after three days bloated and covered with yellow bottom mud like a crusty ancient mummy. He\u0027d seen what remained of Walter and Jeanine Traynor after the head-on collision six years ago between Walter\u0027s Buick and a logging truck driven by a kid eating pep pills. He\u0027d seen the dark shiny mass of Little Stevie Cauley after firemen doused the flames of the crumpled black dragster named Midnight Mona. He had looked upon the grinning rictus of death several times, had taken that sight like a man, but this one was different. This one wore the face of murder. The car was going down. as its hood sank, its tail fins started rising. The body behind the wheel shifted again, and my father saw something on the man\u0027s shoulder. a blue patch, there against the white. Not a bruise, no; a tattoo. It was a skull with wings swept back from the bony temples. a great burst of bubbles blew out of the car as more water rushed in. The lake would not be denied; it was going to claim its toy and tuck it away in a secret drawer. as the car began to slide down into the murk, the suction grabbed my father\u0027s legs and pulled him under, and standing on the red rock cliff I saw his head disappear and I shouted \"Dad!\" as panic seized my guts. Underwater, he fought the lake\u0027s muscles. The car fell away beneath him, and as his legs thrashed for a hold in the liquid tomb, more bubbles rushed up and broke him loose and he climbed up their silver staircase toward the attic of air. I saw his head break the surface. \"Dad!\" I shouted again. \"Come on back, Dad!\" \"I\u0027m all right!\" he answered, but his voice was shaky. \"I\u0027m comin\u0027 in!\" He began dog-paddling toward shore, his body suddenly as weak as a squeezed-out rag. The lake continued to erupt where the car disturbed its innards, like something bad being digested. Dad couldn\u0027t get up the red rock cliff, so he swam to a place where he could clamber up on kudzu vines and stones. \"I\u0027m all right!\" he said again as he came out of the lake and his legs sank to the knees in mud. a turtle the size of a dinner plate skittered past him and submerged with a perplexed snort. I glanced back toward the milk truck; I don\u0027t know why, but I did. and I saw a figure standing in the woods across the road. Just standing there, wearing a long dark coat. Its folds moved with the wind. Maybe I\u0027d felt the eyes of whoever was watching me as I\u0027d watched my father swim to the sinking car. I shivered a little, bone cold, and then I blinked a couple of times and where the figure had been was just windswept woods again. \"Coryi\" my dad called. \"Gimme a hand up, son!\" I went down to the muddy shore and gave him as much help as a cold, scared child could. Then his feet found solid earth and he pushed the wet hair back from his forehead. \"Gotta get to a phone,\" he said urgently. \"There was a man in that car. Went straight down to the bottom!\" \"I saw... I saw...\" I pointed toward the woods on the other side of Route Ten. \"Somebody was-\" \"Come on, let\u0027s go!\" My father was already crossing the road with his sturdy, soggy legs, his shoes in his hand. I jump-started my own legs and followed him as close as a shadow, and my gaze returned to where I\u0027d seen that figure but nobody was there, nobody, nobody at all. Dad started the milk truck\u0027s engine and switched on the heater. His teeth were chattering, and in the gray twilight his face looked as pale as candle wax. \"Damnedest thing,\" he said, and this shocked me because he never cursed in front of me. \"Handcuffed to the wheel, he was. Handcuffed. My God, that fella\u0027s face was all beat up!\" \"Who was iti\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" He turned the heater up, and then he started driving south toward the nearest house. \"Somebody did a job on him, that\u0027s for sure! Lord, I\u0027m cold!\" a dirt road turned to the right, and my father followed it. Fifty yards off Route Ten stood a small white house with a screened-in front porch. a rose garden stood off to one side. Parked under a green plastic awning were two cars, one a red Mustang and the other an old Cadillac splotched with rust. My dad pulled up in front of the house and said, \"Wait here,\" and he walked to the door in his wet socks and rang the bell. He had to ring it two more times before the door opened with a tinkle of chimes, and a red-haired woman who made three of my mom stood there wearing a blue robe with black flowers on it. Dad said, \"Miss Grace, I need to use your telephone real quick.\" \"You\u0027re all wet!\" Miss Grace\u0027s voice sounded like the rasp of a rusty saw blade. She gripped a cigarette in one hand, and rings sparkled on her fingers. \"Somethin\u0027 bad\u0027s happened,\" Dad told her, and she sighed like a redheaded raincloud and said, \"all right, come on in, then. Watch the carpet.\" Dad entered the house, the chimey door closed, and I sat in the milk truck as the first orange rays of sunlight started breaking over the eastern hills. I could smell the lake in the truck with me, a puddle of water on the floorboard beneath my father\u0027s seat. I had seen somebody standing in the woods. I knew I had. Hadn\u0027t Ii Why hadn\u0027t he come over to see about the man in the cari and who had the man in the car beeni I was puzzling over these questions when the door opened again and Miss Grace came out, this time wearing a floppy white sweater over her blue gown. She had on sneakers, her ankles and calves thick as young trees. She had a box of Lorna Doone cookies in one hand and the burning cigarette in the other, and she walked to the milk truck and smiled at me. \"Hey there,\" she said. \"You\u0027re Cory.\" \"Yes\u0027m,\" I answered. Miss Grace didn\u0027t have much of a smile. Her lips were thin and her nose was broad and flat and her brows were black-penciled streaks above deep-set blue eyes. She thrust the Lorna Doones at me. \"Want a cookiei\" I wasn\u0027t hungry, but my folks had always taught me never to refuse a gift. I took one. \"Have two,\" Miss Grace offered, and I took a second cookie. She ate a cookie herself and then sucked on the cigarette and blew smoke through her nostrils. \"Your daddy\u0027s our milkman,\" she said. \"I believe you\u0027ve got us on your list. Six quarts of milk, two buttermilks, two chocolates, and three pints of cream.\" I checked the list. There was her name-Grace Stafford-and the order, just as she\u0027d said. I told her I\u0027d get everything for her, and I started putting the order together. \"How old are youi\" Miss Grace asked as I worked. \"Twelvei\" \"No, ma\u0027am. Not until July.\" \"I\u0027ve got a son.\" Miss Grace knocked ashes from her cigarette. She chewed on another cookie. \"Turned twenty in December. He lives in San antonio. Know where that isi\" \"Yes ma\u0027am. Texas. Where the alamo is.\" \"That\u0027s right. Turned twenty, which makes me thirty-eight. I\u0027m an old fossil, ain\u0027t Ii\" This was a trick question, I thought. \"No ma\u0027am,\" I decided to say. \"Well, you\u0027re a little diplomat, ain\u0027t youi\" She smiled again, and this time the smile was in her eyes. \"Have another cookie.\" She left me the box and walked to the door, and she hollered into the house: \"Lainie! Lainie, get your butt up and come out here!\" My dad emerged first. He looked old in the hard light of morning, and there were dark circles under his eyes. \"Called the sheriff\u0027s office,\" he told me as he sat in his wet seat and squeezed his feet into his shoes. \"Somebody\u0027s gonna meet us where the car went in.\" \"Who the hell was iti\" Miss Grace asked. \"I couldn\u0027t tell. His face was...\" He glanced quickly at me, then back to the woman. \"He was beat up pretty bad.\" \"Must\u0027ve been drunk. Moonshinin\u0027, most likely.\" \"I don\u0027t think so.\" Dad hadn\u0027t said anything over the phone about the car\u0027s driver being naked, strangled with a piano wire, and handcuffed to the wheel. That was for the sheriff and not for Miss Grace\u0027s or anybody else\u0027s ears. \"You ever see a fella with a tattoo on his left shoulderi Looked like a skull with wings growin\u0027 out of its headi\" \"I\u0027ve seen more tattoos than the Navy,\" Miss Grace said, \"but I can\u0027t recall anything like that around here. Whyi Fella have his shirt off or somethin\u0027i\" \"Yeah, he did. Had that skull with wings tattooed right about here.\" He touched his left shoulder. Dad shivered again, and rubbed his hands together. \"They\u0027ll never bring that car up. Never. Saxon\u0027s Lake is three hundred feet deep if it\u0027s an inch.\" The chimes sounded. I looked toward the door with the tray of milk quarts in my arms. a girl with sleep-swollen eyes stumbled out. She was wearing a long plaid bathrobe and her feet were bare. Her hair was the color of cornsilk and hung around her shoulders, and as she neared the milk truck she blinked in the light and said, \"I\u0027m all fucked up.\" I think I must\u0027ve almost fallen down, because never in my life had I heard a female use a word that dirty before. Oh, I knew what the word meant and all, but its casual use from a pretty mouth shocked the fool out of me. \"There\u0027s a young man on the premises, Lainie,\" Miss Grace said in a voice that could curl an iron nail. \"Watch your language, please.\" Lainie looked at me, and her cool stare made me recall the time I\u0027d put a fork in an electric socket. Lainie\u0027s eyes were chocolate brown and her lips seemed to wear a half smile, half sneer. Something about her face looked tough and wary, as if she\u0027d run out of trust. There was a small red mark in the hollow of her throat. \"Who\u0027s the kidi\" she asked. \"Mr. Mackenson\u0027s son. Show some class, heari\" I swallowed hard and averted my eyes from Lainie\u0027s. Her robe was creeping open. It hit me what kind of girl used bad words, and what kind of place this was. I had heard from both Johnny Wilson and Ben Sears that there was a house full of whores somewhere near Zephyr. It was common knowledge at the elementary school. When you told somebody to \"go suck a whore,\" you were standing right on the razor\u0027s edge of violence. I\u0027d always imagined the whorehouse to be a mansion, though, with drooping willow trees and black servants who fetched the customers mint juleps on the front porch; the reality, however, was that the whorehouse wasn\u0027t much of a step up from a broken-down trailer. Still and all, here it was right in front of me, and the girl with cornsilk hair and a dirty mouth earned her living by the pleasures of the flesh. I felt goose bumps ripple up my back, and I can\u0027t tell you the kind of scenes that moved like a slow, dangerous storm through my head. \"Take that milk and stuff to the kitchen,\" Miss Grace told her. The sneer won out over the smile, and those brown eyes turned black. \"I ain\u0027t got kitchen duty! It\u0027s Donna ann\u0027s week!\" \"It\u0027s whose week I say it is, missy, and you know why I ought to put you in the kitchen for a whole month, too! Now, you do what I tell you and keep your smart mouth shut!\" Lainie\u0027s lips drew up into a puckered, practiced pout. But her eyes did not register the chastisement so falsely; they held cold centers of anger. She took the tray from me, and standing with her back to my dad and Miss Grace, she stuck out her wet pink tongue in my face and curled it up into a funnel. Then the tongue slicked back into her mouth, she turned away from me, and dismissed all of us with a buttstrut that was as wicked as a sword slash. She swayed on into the house, and after Lainie was gone Miss Grace grunted and said, \"She\u0027s as rough as a cob.\" \"aren\u0027t they alli\" Dad asked, and Miss Grace blew a smoke ring and answered, \"Yeah, but she don\u0027t even pretend she\u0027s got manners.\" Her gaze settled on me. \"Cory, why don\u0027t you keep the cookies. all righti\" I looked at Dad. He shrugged. \"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" I said. \"Good. It was a real pleasure to meet you.\" Miss Grace returned her attention to my father and the cigarette to the corner of her mouth. \"Let me know how everything turns out.\" \"I will, and thanks for lettin\u0027 me use the phone.\" He slid behind the wheel again. \"I\u0027ll pick up the milk tray next trip.\" \"Ya\u0027ll be careful,\" Miss Grace said, and she went into the white-painted whorehouse as Dad started the engine and let off the hand brake. We drove back to where the car had gone in. Saxon\u0027s Lake was streaked with blue and purple in the morning light. Dad pulled the milk truck off onto a dirt road; the road, both of us realized, was where the car had come from. Then we sat and waited for the sheriff as the sunlight strengthened and the sky turned azure. Sitting there, my mind was split: one part was thinking about the car and the figure I thought I\u0027d seen, and the other part was wondering how my dad knew Miss Grace at the whorehouse so well. But Dad knew all of his customers; he talked about them to Mom at the dinner table. I never recalled him mentioning Miss Grace or the whorehouse, however. Well, it wasn\u0027t a proper subject for the dinner table, was iti and anyway, they wouldn\u0027t talk about such things when I was around, even though all my friends and everybody else at school from the fourth grade up knew there was a house full of bad girls somewhere around Zephyr. I had been there. I had actually seen a bad girl. I had seen her curled tongue and her butt move in the folds of her robe. That, I figured, was going to make me one heck of a celebrity. \"Coryi\" my father said quietly. \"Do you know what kind of business Miss Grace runs in that housei\" \"I...\" Even a third-grader could\u0027ve figured it out. \"Yes sir.\" \"any other day, I would\u0027ve just left the order by the front door.\" He was staring at the lake, as if seeing the car still tumbling slowly down through the depths with a handcuffed corpse at the wheel. \"Miss Grace has been on my delivery route for two years. Every Monday and Thursday, like clockwork. In case it\u0027s crossed your mind, your mother does know I come out here.\" I didn\u0027t answer, but I felt a whole lot lighter. \"I don\u0027t want you to tell anybody about Miss Grace or that house,\" my father went on. \"I want you to forget you were there, and what you saw and heard. Can you do thati\" \"Whyi\" I had to ask. \"Because Miss Grace might be a lot different than you, me, or your mother, and she might be tough and mean and her line of work might not be a preacher\u0027s dream, but she\u0027s a good lady. I just don\u0027t want talk gettin\u0027 stirred up. The less said about Miss Grace and that house, the better. Do you seei\" \"I guess I do.\" \"Good.\" He flexed his fingers on the steering wheel. The subject was closed. I was true to my word. My celebrityhood took flight, and that was that. I was about to open my mouth to tell him about the figure I\u0027d seen in the woods when a black and white Ford with a bubble light on top and the town seal of Zephyr on the driver\u0027s door rounded the corner and slowed to a stop near the milk truck. Sheriff amory, whose first name was J.T., standing for Junior Talmadge, got out and Dad walked over to meet him. Sheriff amory was a thin, tall man whose long-jawed face made me think of a picture I\u0027d seen: Ichabod Crane trying to outrace the Headless Horseman. He had big hands and feet and a pair of ears that might\u0027ve shamed Dumbo. If his nose had been any larger, he would\u0027ve made a dandy weather-vane. He wore his sheriff\u0027s star pinned to the front of his hat, and underneath it his dome was almost bald except for a wreath of dark brown hair. He pushed his hat back up on his shiny forehead as he and my dad talked at the lake\u0027s edge and I watched my father\u0027s hand motions as he showed Sheriff amory where the car had come from and where it had gone. Then they both looked out toward the lake\u0027s still surface, and I knew what they were thinking. That car might\u0027ve sunken to the center of the earth. Even the snapping turtles that lived along the lakeshore couldn\u0027t get far enough down to ever see that car again. Whoever the driver had been, he was sitting in the dark right now with mud in his teeth. \"Handcuffed,\" Sheriff amory said, in his quiet voice. He had thick dark eyebrows over deep-set eyes the color of coal, and the pallor of his flesh suggested he had an affinity to the night. \"You\u0027re sure about that, Tomi and about the wire, tooi\" \"I\u0027m sure. Whoever strangled that fella did a hell of a job. Near about took his head off.\" \"Handcuffed,\" the sheriff said again. \"That was so he wouldn\u0027t float out, I reckon.\" He tapped his lower lip with a forefinger. \"Well,\" he said at last, \"I believe we\u0027ve got a murder on our hands, don\u0027t youi\" \"If it wasn\u0027t, I don\u0027t know what murder is.\" as they talked, I got out of the milk truck and wandered over to where I thought I\u0027d seen that person watching me. There was nothing but weeds, rocks, and dirt where he\u0027d been standing. If it had been a man, I thought. Could it have been a womani I hadn\u0027t seen long hair, but then again I hadn\u0027t seen much of anything but a coat swirling in the wind. I walked back and forth along the line of trees. Beyond it, the woods deepened and swampy ground took over. I found nothing. \"Better come on to the office and let me write it up,\" the sheriff told my father. \"If you want to go home and get some dry clothes on, that\u0027d be fine.\" My dad nodded. \"I\u0027ve got to finish my deliveries and get Cory to school, too.\" \"Okay. Seems to me we can\u0027t do much for that fella at the bottom, anyhow.\" He grunted, his hands in his pockets. \"a murder. Last murder we had in Zephyr was in 1961. You remember when Bo Kallagan beat his wife to death with a bowlin\u0027 trophyi\" I returned to the milk truck and waited for my dad. The sun was up good and proper now, lighting the world. Or, at least, the world I knew. But things weighed heavy on my mind. It seemed to me that there were two worlds: one before the sun, and one after. and if that were true, then maybe there were people who were citizens of those different worlds as well. Some moved easily through the landscape of night, and others clung to the bright hours. Maybe I had seen one of those darktime citizens, in the world before the sun. and-a chilling thought-maybe he had seen me seeing him, too. I realized I had brought mud back into the milk truck. It was smeared all over my Keds. I looked at the soles, and the earth I had collected. On the bottom of my left Ked was a small green feather.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/boy-s-life/page-2.html","bookId":2471,"book":{"id":2471,"title":"Boy\u0027s Life","description":"Storyline: Zephyr, alabama, is an idyllic hometown for eleven-year-old Cory Mackenson -- a place where monsters swim the river deep and friends are forever.
