And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons. \\n\\n [bbe] Now there came a time, in the days of the judges, when there was no food in the land. And a certain man went from Beth-lehem-judah, he and his wife and his two sons, to make a living-place in the country of Moab. \\n\\n 1:2 [hgb] 这 人 名 叫 以 利 米 勒 ， 他 的 妻 名 叫 拿 俄 米 。 他 两 个 儿 子 ， 一 个 名 叫 玛 伦 ， 一 个 名 叫 基 连 ， 都 是 犹 大 伯 利 恒 的 以 法 他 人 。 他 们 到 了 摩 押 地 ， 就 住 在 那 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there. \\n\\n [bbe] And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and were there for some time. \\n\\n 1:3 [hgb] 后 来 拿 俄 米 的 丈 夫 以 利 米 勒 死 了 ， 剩 下 妇 人 和 她 两 个 儿 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Elimelech Naomi\u0027s husband died; and she was left, and her two sons. \\n\\n [bbe] And Elimelech, Naomi\u0027s husband, came to his end; and only her two sons were with her. \\n\\n 1:4 [hgb] 这 两 个 儿 子 娶 了 摩 押 女 子 为 妻 ， 一 个 名 叫 俄 珥 巴 ， 一 个 名 叫 路 得 ， 在 那 里 住 了 约 有 十 年 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years. \\n\\n [bbe] And they took two women of Moab as their wives: the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth; and they went on living there for about ten years. \\n\\n 1:5 [hgb] 玛 伦 和 基 连 二 人 也 死 了 ， 剩 下 拿 俄 米 ， 没 有 丈 夫 ， 也 没 有 儿 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband. \\n\\n [bbe] And Mahlon and Chilion came to their end; and the woman was without her two sons and her husband. \\n\\n 1:6 [hgb] 她 就 与 两 个 儿 妇 起 身 ， 要 从 摩 押 地 归 回 。 因 为 她 在 摩 押 地 ， 听 见 耶 和 华 眷 顾 自 己 的 百 姓 ， 赐 粮 食 与 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread. \\n\\n [bbe] So she and her daughters-in-law got ready to go back from the country of Moab, for news had come to her in the country of Moab that the Lord, in mercy for his people, had given them food. \\n\\n 1:7 [hgb] 于 是 她 和 两 个 儿 妇 起 行 离 开 所 住 的 地 方 ， 要 回 犹 大 地 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah. \\n\\n [bbe] And she went out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on their way to go back to the land of Judah. \\n\\n 1:8 [hgb] 拿 俄 米 对 两 个 儿 妇 说 ， 你 们 各 人 回 娘 家 去 吧 ， 愿 耶 和 华 恩 待 你 们 ， 象 你 们 恩 待 已 死 的 人 与 我 一 样 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother\u0027s house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me. \\n\\n [bbe] And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go back to your mothers\u0027 houses: may the Lord be good to you as you have been good to the dead and to me: \\n\\n 1:9 [hgb] 愿 耶 和 华 使 你 们 各 在 新 夫 家 中 得 平 安 。 于 是 ， 拿 俄 米 与 她 们 亲 嘴 。 她 们 就 放 声 而 哭 ， \\n\\n [kjv] The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept. \\n\\n [bbe] May the Lord give you rest in the houses of your husbands. Then she gave them a kiss; and they were weeping bitterly. \\n\\n 1:10 [hgb] 说 ， 不 然 ， 我 们 必 与 你 一 同 回 你 本 国 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people. \\n\\n [bbe] And they said to her, No, but we will go back with you to your people. \\n\\n 1:11 [hgb] 拿 俄 米 说 ， 我 女 儿 们 哪 ， 回 去 吧 ， 为 何 要 跟 我 去 呢 ？ 我 还 能 生 子 作 你 们 的 丈 夫 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands? \\n\\n [bbe] But Naomi said, Go back, my daughters; why will you come with me? Have I more sons in my body, to become your husbands? \\n\\n 1:12 [hgb] 我 女 儿 们 哪 ， 回 去 吧 ， 我 年 纪 老 迈 ， 不 能 再 有 丈 夫 。 即 或 说 ， 我 还 有 指 望 ， 今 夜 有 丈 夫 可 以 生 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons; \\n\\n [bbe] Go back, my daughters, and go on your way; I am so old now that I may not have another husband. If I said, I have hopes, if I had a husband tonight, and might have sons, \\n\\n 1:13 [hgb] 你 们 岂 能 等 着 他 们 长 大 呢 ？ 你 们 岂 能 等 着 他 们 不 嫁 别 人 呢 ？ 我 女 儿 们 哪 ， 不 要 这 样 ， 我 为 你 们 的 缘 故 ， 甚 是 愁 苦 ， 因 为 耶 和 华 伸 手 攻 击 我 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me. \\n\\n [bbe] Would you keep yourselves till they were old enough? would you keep from having husbands for them? No, my daughters; but I am very sad for you that the hand of the Lord is against me. \\n\\n 1:14 [hgb] 两 个 儿 妇 又 放 声 而 哭 ， 俄 珥 巴 与 婆 婆 亲 嘴 而 别 ， 只 是 路 得 舍 不 得 拿 俄 米 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her. \\n\\n [bbe] Then again they were weeping; and Orpah gave her mother-in-law a kiss, but Ruth would not be parted from her. \\n\\n 1:15 [hgb] 拿 俄 米 说 ， 看 哪 ， 你 嫂 子 已 经 回 她 本 国 ， 和 她 所 拜 的 神 那 里 去 了 ， 你 也 跟 着 你 嫂 子 回 去 吧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law. \\n\\n [bbe] And Naomi said, See, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods: go back after your sister-in-law. \\n\\n 1:16 [hgb] 路 得 说 ， 不 要 催 我 回 去 不 跟 随 你 ， 你 往 哪 里 去 ， 我 也 往 哪 里 去 。 你 在 哪 里 住 宿 ， 我 也 在 哪 里 住 宿 。 你 的 国 就 是 我 的 国 ， 你 的 神 就 是 我 的 神 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God: \\n\\n [bbe] But Ruth said, Give up requesting me to go away from you, or to go back without you: for where you go I will go; and where you take your rest I will take my rest; your people will be my people, and your God my God. \\n\\n 1:17 [hgb] 你 在 哪 里 死 ， 我 也 在 哪 里 死 ， 也 葬 在 那 里 。 除 非 死 能 使 你 我 相 离 ， 不 然 ， 愿 耶 和 华 重 重 地 降 罚 与 我 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me. \\n\\n [bbe] Wherever death comes to you, death will come to me, and there will be my last resting-place; the Lord do so to me and more if we are parted by anything but death. \\n\\n 1:18 [hgb] 拿 俄 米 见 路 得 定 意 要 跟 随 自 己 去 ， 就 不 再 劝 她 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her. \\n\\n [bbe] And when she saw that Ruth was strong in her purpose to go with her she said no more. \\n\\n 1:19 [hgb] 于 是 二 人 同 行 ， 来 到 伯 利 恒 。 她 们 到 了 伯 利 恒 ， 合 城 的 人 就 都 惊 讶 。 妇 女 们 说 ， 这 是 拿 俄 米 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi? \\n\\n [bbe] So the two of them went on till they came to Beth-lehem. And when they came to Beth-lehem all the town was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi? \\n\\n 1:20 [hgb] 拿 俄 米 对 他 们 说 ， 不 要 叫 我 拿 俄 米 （ 拿 俄 米 就 是 甜 的 意 思 ） ， 要 叫 我 玛 拉 （ 玛 拉 就 是 苦 的 意 思 ） ， 因 为 全 能 者 使 我 受 了 大 苦 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me. \\n\\n [bbe] And she said to them, Do not let my name be Naomi, but Mara, for the Ruler of all has given me a bitter fate. \\n\\n 1:21 [hgb] 我 满 满 的 出 去 ， 耶 和 华 使 我 空 空 的 回 来 。 耶 和 华 降 祸 与 我 ， 全 能 者 使 我 受 苦 ， 既 是 这 样 ， 你 们 为 何 还 叫 我 拿 俄 米 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me? \\n\\n [bbe] I went out full, and the Lord has sent me back again with nothing; why do you give me the name Naomi, seeing that the Lord has given witness against me, and the Ruler of all has sent sorrow on me? \\n\\n 1:22 [hgb] 拿 俄 米 和 她 儿 妇 摩 押 女 子 路 得 ， 从 摩 押 地 回 来 到 伯 利 恒 ， 正 是 动 手 割 大 麦 的 时 候 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest. \\n\\n [bbe] So Naomi came back out of the country of Moab, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her; and they came to Beth-lehem in the first days of the grain-cutting. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/24/345.html","bookId":236,"book":{"id":236,"title":"Ruth路得记（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land.
