And he turned aside, and sat down. \\n\\n [bbe] And Boaz went up to the public place of the town, and took his seat there: and the near relation of whom he had been talking came by; and Boaz, crying out to him by name, said, Come and be seated here. And he came and was seated. \\n\\n 4:2 [hgb] 波 阿 斯 又 从 本 城 的 长 老 中 拣 选 了 十 人 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 请 你 们 坐 在 这 里 。 他 们 就 都 坐 下 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down. \\n\\n [bbe] Then he got ten of the responsible men of the town, and said, Be seated here. And they took their seats. \\n\\n 4:3 [hgb] 波 阿 斯 对 那 至 近 的 亲 属 说 ， 从 摩 押 地 回 来 的 拿 俄 米 ， 现 在 要 卖 我 们 族 兄 以 利 米 勒 的 那 块 地 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech\u0027s: \\n\\n [bbe] Then he said to the near relation, Naomi, who has come back from the country of Moab, is offering for a price that bit of land which was our brother Elimelech\u0027s: \\n\\n 4:4 [hgb] 我 想 当 赎 那 块 地 的 是 你 ， 其 次 是 我 ， 以 外 再 没 有 别 人 了 。 你 可 以 在 这 里 的 人 面 前 ， 和 我 本 国 的 长 老 面 前 说 明 ， 你 若 肯 赎 就 赎 ， 若 不 肯 赎 就 告 诉 我 。 那 人 回 答 说 ， 我 肯 赎 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it. \\n\\n [bbe] And it was in my mind to give you the chance of taking it, with the approval of those seated here and of the responsible men of my people. If you are ready to do what it is right for a relation to do, then do it: but if you will not do it, say so to me now; for there is no one who has the right to do it but you, and after you myself. And he said, I will do it. \\n\\n 4:5 [hgb] 波 阿 斯 说 ， 你 从 拿 俄 米 手 中 买 这 地 的 时 候 ， 也 当 娶 （ 原 文 作 买 十 节 同 ） 死 人 的 妻 摩 押 女 子 路 得 ， 使 死 人 在 产 业 上 存 留 他 的 名 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Boaz said, On the day when you take this field, you will have to take with it Ruth, the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, so that you may keep the name of the dead living in his heritage. \\n\\n 4:6 [hgb] 那 人 说 ， 这 样 我 就 不 能 赎 了 ， 恐 怕 于 我 的 产 业 有 碍 。 你 可 以 赎 我 所 当 赎 的 ， 我 不 能 赎 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem it. \\n\\n [bbe] And the near relation said, I am not able to do the relation\u0027s part, for fear of damaging the heritage I have: you may do it in my place, for I am not able to do it myself. \\n\\n 4:7 [hgb] 从 前 ， 在 以 色 列 中 要 定 夺 什 么 事 ， 或 赎 回 ， 或 交 易 ， 这 人 就 脱 鞋 给 那 人 。 以 色 列 人 都 以 此 为 证 据 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was a testimony in Israel. \\n\\n [bbe] Now, in earlier times this was the way in Israel when property was taken over by a near relation, or when there was a change of owner. To make the exchange certain one man took off his shoe and gave it to the other; and this was a witness in Israel. \\n\\n 4:8 [hgb] 那 人 对 波 阿 斯 说 ， 你 自 己 买 吧 。 于 是 将 鞋 脱 下 来 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew off his shoe. \\n\\n [bbe] So the near relation said to Boaz, Take it for yourself. And he took off his shoe. \\n\\n 4:9 [hgb] 波 阿 斯 对 长 老 和 众 民 说 ， 你 们 今 日 作 见 证 ， 凡 属 以 利 米 勒 和 基 连 ， 玛 伦 的 ， 我 都 从 拿 俄 米 手 中 置 买 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech\u0027s, and all that was Chilion\u0027s and Mahlon\u0027s, of the hand of Naomi. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Boaz said to the responsible men and to all the people, You are witnesses today that I have taken at a price from Naomi all the property which was Elimelech\u0027s, and everything which was Chilion\u0027s and Mahlon\u0027s. \\n\\n 4:10 [hgb] 又 娶 了 玛 伦 的 妻 摩 押 女 子 路 得 为 妻 ， 好 在 死 人 的 产 业 上 存 留 他 的 名 ， 免 得 他 的 名 在 本 族 本 乡 灭 没 。 你 们 今 日 可 以 作 见 证 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day. \\n\\n [bbe] And, further, I have taken Ruth, the Moabitess, who was the wife of Mahlon, to be my wife, to keep the name of the dead man living in his heritage, so that his name may not be cut off from among his countrymen, and from the memory of his town: you are witnesses this day. \\n\\n 4:11 [hgb] 在 城 门 坐 着 的 众 民 和 长 老 都 说 ， 我 们 作 见 证 。 愿 耶 和 华 使 进 你 家 的 这 女 子 ， 像 建 立 以 色 列 家 的 拉 结 ， 利 亚 二 人 一 样 。 又 愿 你 在 以 法 他 得 亨 通 ， 在 伯 利 恒 得 名 声 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem: \\n\\n [bbe] And all the people who were in the public place, and the responsible men, said, We are witnesses. May the Lord make this woman, who is about to come into your house, like Rachel and Leah, which two were the builders of the house of Israel: and may you have wealth in Ephrathah, and be great in Beth-lehem; \\n\\n 4:12 [hgb] 愿 耶 和 华 从 这 少 年 女 子 赐 你 后 裔 ， 使 你 的 家 像 他 玛 ， 从 犹 大 所 生 法 勒 斯 的 家 一 般 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman. \\n\\n [bbe] May your family be like the family of Perez, the son whom Tamar gave to Judah, from the offspring which the Lord may give you by this young woman. \\n\\n 4:13 [hgb] 于 是 ， 波 阿 斯 娶 了 路 得 为 妻 ， 与 她 同 房 。 耶 和 华 使 她 怀 孕 生 了 一 个 儿 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son. \\n\\n [bbe] So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife; and he went in to her, and the Lord made her with child and she gave birth to a son. \\n\\n 4:14 [hgb] 妇 人 们 对 拿 俄 米 说 ， 耶 和 华 是 应 当 称 颂 的 。 因 为 今 日 没 有 撇 下 你 使 你 无 至 近 的 亲 属 。 愿 这 孩 子 在 以 色 列 中 得 名 声 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel. \\n\\n [bbe] And the women said to Naomi, A blessing on the Lord, who has not let you be this day without a near relation, and may his name be great in Israel. \\n\\n 4:15 [hgb] 他 必 提 起 你 的 精 神 ， 奉 养 你 的 老 ， 因 为 是 爱 慕 你 的 那 儿 妇 所 生 的 。 有 这 儿 妇 比 有 七 个 儿 子 还 好 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him. \\n\\n [bbe] He will be a giver of new life to you, and your comforter when you are old, for your daughter-in-law, who, in her love for you, is better than seven sons, has given birth to him. \\n\\n 4:16 [hgb] 拿 俄 米 就 把 孩 子 抱 在 怀 中 ， 作 他 的 养 母 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it. \\n\\n [bbe] And Naomi took the child and put her arms round it, and she took care of it. \\n\\n 4:17 [hgb] 邻 舍 的 妇 人 说 ， 拿 俄 米 得 孩 子 了 。 就 给 孩 子 起 名 叫 俄 备 得 。 这 俄 备 得 是 耶 西 的 父 ， 耶 西 是 大 卫 的 父 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David. \\n\\n [bbe] And the women who were her neighbours gave it a name, saying, Naomi has a child; and they gave him the name of Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David. \\n\\n 4:18 [hgb] 法 勒 斯 的 后 代 ， 记 在 下 面 。 法 勒 斯 生 希 斯 仑 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron, \\n\\n [bbe] Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez became the father of Hezron; \\n\\n 4:19 [hgb] 希 斯 仑 生 兰 ， 兰 生 亚 米 拿 达 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab, \\n\\n [bbe] And Hezron became the father of Ram, and Ram became the father of Amminadab; \\n\\n 4:20 [hgb] 亚 米 拿 达 生 拿 顺 ， 拿 顺 生 撒 门 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon, \\n\\n [bbe] And Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon became the father of Salmon; \\n\\n 4:21 [hgb] 撒 门 生 波 阿 斯 ， 波 阿 斯 生 俄 备 得 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed, \\n\\n [bbe] And Salmon became the father of Boaz, and Boaz became the father of Obed; \\n\\n 4:22 [hgb] 俄 备 得 生 耶 西 ， 耶 西 生 大 卫 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David. \\n\\n [bbe] And Obed became the father of Jesse, and Jesse became the father of David. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/24/348.html","bookId":236,"book":{"id":236,"title":"Ruth路得记（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land.
