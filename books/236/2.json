{"id":7235,"no":2,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"2:1 [hgb] 拿 俄 米 的 丈 夫 以 利 米 勒 的 亲 族 中 ， 有 一 个 人 名 叫 波 阿 斯 ， 是 个 大 财 主 。 [kjv] And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband\u0027s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz. [bbe] And Naomi had a relation of her husband, a man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz. 2:2 [hgb] 摩 押 女 子 路 得 对 拿 俄 米 说 ， 容 我 往 田 间 去 ， 我 蒙 谁 的 恩 ， 就 在 谁 的 身 后 拾 取 麦 穗 。 拿 俄 米 说 ， 女 儿 阿 ， 你 只 管 去 。 [kjv] And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter. [bbe] And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Now let me go into the field and take up the heads of grain after him in whose eyes I may have grace. And she said to her, Go, my daughter. 2:3 [hgb] 路 得 就 去 了 ， 来 到 田 间 ， 在 收 割 的 人 身 后 拾 取 麦 穗 。 她 恰 巧 到 了 以 利 米 勒 本 族 的 人 ， 波 阿 斯 那 块 田 里 。 [kjv] And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech. [bbe] And she went, and came and took up the heads of grain in the field after the cutters; and by chance she went into that part of the field which was the property of Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech. 2:4 [hgb] 波 阿 斯 正 从 伯 利 恒 来 ， 对 收 割 的 人 说 ， 愿 耶 和 华 与 你 们 同 在 。 他 们 回 答 说 ， 愿 耶 和 华 赐 福 与 你 。 [kjv] And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee. [bbe] And Boaz came from Beth-lehem, and said to the grain-cutters, The Lord be with you. And they made answer, The Lord give you his blessing. 2:5 [hgb] 波 阿 斯 问 监 管 收 割 的 仆 人 说 ， 那 是 谁 家 的 女 子 。 [kjv] Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this? [bbe] Then Boaz said to his servant who was in authority over the cutters, Whose girl is this? 2:6 [hgb] 监 管 收 割 的 仆 人 回 答 说 ， 是 那 摩 押 女 子 ， 跟 随 拿 俄 米 从 摩 押 地 回 来 的 。 [kjv] And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab: [bbe] And the servant who was in authority over the cutters said, It is a Moabite girl who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab; 2:7 [hgb] 她 说 ， 请 你 容 我 跟 着 收 割 的 人 ， 拾 取 打 捆 剩 下 的 麦 穗 ， 她 从 早 晨 直 到 如 今 ， 除 了 在 屋 子 里 坐 一 会 儿 ， 常 在 这 里 。 [kjv] And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house. [bbe] And she said to me, Let me come into the grain-field and take up the grain after the cutters. So she came, and has been here from morning till now, without resting even for a minute. 2:8 [hgb] 波 阿 斯 对 路 得 说 ， 女 儿 阿 ， 听 我 说 ， 不 要 往 别 人 田 里 拾 取 麦 穗 ， 也 不 要 离 开 这 里 ， 要 常 与 我 使 女 们 在 一 处 。 [kjv] Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens: [bbe] Then said Boaz to Ruth, Give ear to me, my daughter: do not go to take up the grain in another field, or go away from here, but keep here by my young women: 2:9 [hgb] 我 的 仆 人 在 那 块 田 收 割 ， 你 就 跟 着 他 们 去 。 我 已 经 吩 咐 仆 人 不 可 欺 负 你 。 你 若 渴 了 ， 就 可 以 到 器 皿 那 里 喝 仆 人 打 来 的 水 。 [kjv] Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn. [bbe] Keep your eyes on the field they are cutting, and go after them; have I not given orders to the young men not to put a hand on you? And when you are in need of drink go to the vessels and take of what the young men have put there. 2:10 [hgb] 路 得 就 俯 伏 在 地 叩 拜 ， 对 他 说 ， 我 既 是 外 邦 人 ， 怎 么 蒙 你 的 恩 ， 这 样 顾 恤 我 呢 ？ [kjv] Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger? [bbe] Then she went down on her face to the earth, and said to him, Why have I grace in your eyes, that you give attention to me, seeing I am from a strange people? 2:11 [hgb] 波 阿 斯 回 答 说 ， 自 从 你 丈 夫 死 后 ， 凡 你 向 婆 婆 所 行 的 ， 并 你 离 开 父 母 和 本 地 ， 到 素 不 认 识 的 民 中 ， 这 些 事 人 全 都 告 诉 我 了 。 [kjv] And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore. [bbe] And Boaz answering said to her, I have had news of everything you have done for your mother-in-law after the death of your husband; how you went away from your father and mother and the land of your birth, and came to a people who are strange to you. 2:12 [hgb] 愿 耶 和 华 照 你 所 行 的 赏 赐 你 。 你 来 投 靠 耶 和 华 以 色 列 神 的 翅 膀 下 ， 愿 你 满 得 他 的 赏 赐 。 [kjv] The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust. [bbe] The Lord give you a reward for what you have done, and may a full reward be given to you by the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take cover. 2:13 [hgb] 路 得 说 ， 我 主 阿 ， 愿 在 你 眼 前 蒙 恩 。 我 虽 然 不 及 你 的 一 个 使 女 ， 你 还 用 慈 爱 的 话 安 慰 我 的 心 。 [kjv] Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens. [bbe] Then she said, May I have grace in your eyes, my lord, for you have given me comfort, and you have said kind words to your servant, though I am not like one of your servants. 2:14 [hgb] 到 了 吃 饭 的 时 候 ， 波 阿 斯 对 路 得 说 ， 你 到 这 里 来 吃 饼 ， 将 饼 蘸 在 醋 里 。 路 得 就 在 收 割 的 人 旁 边 坐 下 ， 他 们 把 烘 了 的 穗 子 递 给 她 。 她 吃 饱 了 ， 还 有 余 剩 的 。 [kjv] And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left. [bbe] And at meal-time Boaz said to her, Come here, and take some of the bread, and put your bit into the wine. And she took her seat among the grain-cutters: and he gave her dry grain, and she took it, and there was more than enough for her meal. 2:15 [hgb] 她 起 来 又 拾 取 麦 穗 ， 波 阿 斯 吩 咐 仆 人 说 ， 她 就 是 在 捆 中 拾 取 麦 穗 ， 也 可 以 容 她 ， 不 可 羞 辱 她 。 [kjv] And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not: [bbe] And when she got ready to take up the grain, Boaz gave his young men orders, saying, Let her take it even from among the cut grain, and say nothing to her. 2:16 [hgb] 并 要 从 捆 里 抽 出 些 来 ， 留 在 地 下 任 她 拾 取 ， 不 可 叱 吓 她 。 [kjv] And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not. [bbe] And let some heads of grain be pulled out of what has been corded up, and dropped for her to take, and let no sharp word be said to her. 2:17 [hgb] 这 样 ， 路 得 在 田 间 拾 取 麦 穗 ， 直 到 晚 上 ， 将 所 拾 取 的 打 了 ， 约 有 一 伊 法 大 麦 。 [kjv] So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley. [bbe] So she went on getting together the heads of grain till evening; and after crushing out the seed it came to about an ephah of grain. 2:18 [hgb] 她 就 把 所 拾 取 的 带 进 城 去 给 婆 婆 看 ， 又 把 她 吃 饱 了 所 剩 的 给 了 婆 婆 。 [kjv] And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed. [bbe] And she took it up and went into the town; and she let her mother-in-law see what she had got, and after taking enough for herself she gave her the rest. 2:19 [hgb] 婆 婆 问 她 说 ， 你 今 日 在 哪 里 拾 取 麦 穗 ， 在 哪 里 做 工 呢 ？ 愿 那 顾 恤 你 的 得 福 。 路 得 就 告 诉 婆 婆 说 ， 我 今 日 在 一 个 名 叫 波 阿 斯 的 人 那 里 做 工 。 [kjv] And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man\u0027s name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz. [bbe] And her mother-in-law said to her, Where did you take up the grain today, and where were you working? May a blessing be on him who gave such attention to you. And she gave her mother-in-law an account of where she had been working, and said, The name of the man with whom I was working today is Boaz. 2:20 [hgb] 拿 俄 米 对 儿 妇 说 ， 愿 那 人 蒙 耶 和 华 赐 福 ， 因 为 他 不 断 地 恩 待 活 人 死 人 。 拿 俄 米 又 说 ， 那 是 我 们 本 族 的 人 ， 是 一 个 至 近 的 亲 属 。 [kjv] And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen. [bbe] And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, May the blessing of the Lord, who has at all times been kind to the living and to the dead, be on him. And Naomi said to her, The man is of our family, one of our near relations. 2:21 [hgb] 摩 押 女 子 路 得 说 ， 他 对 我 说 ， 你 要 紧 随 我 的 仆 人 拾 取 麦 穗 ， 直 等 他 们 收 完 了 我 的 庄 稼 。 [kjv] And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest. [bbe] And Ruth the Moabitess said, Truly, he said to me, Keep near my young men till all my grain is cut. 2:22 [hgb] 拿 俄 米 对 儿 妇 路 得 说 ， 女 儿 阿 ， 你 跟 着 他 的 使 女 出 去 ， 不 叫 人 遇 见 你 在 别 人 田 间 ， 这 才 为 好 。 [kjv] And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field. [bbe] And Naomi said to Ruth, her daughter-in-law, It is better, my daughter, for you to go out with his servant-girls, so that no danger may come to you in another field. 2:23 [hgb] 于 是 路 得 与 波 阿 斯 的 使 女 常 在 一 处 拾 取 麦 穗 ， 直 到 收 完 了 大 麦 和 小 麦 。 路 得 仍 与 婆 婆 同 住 。 [kjv] So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law. [bbe] So she kept near the servant-girls of Boaz to take up the grain till the cutting of the early grain and the cutting of the late grain were ended; and she went on living with her mother-in-law.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/24/346.html","bookId":236,"book":{"id":236,"title":"Ruth路得记（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land.
