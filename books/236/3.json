{"id":7236,"no":3,"title":"Chapter 3","content":"3:1 [hgb] 路 得 的 婆 婆 拿 俄 米 对 她 说 ， 女 儿 阿 ， 我 不 当 为 你 找 个 安 身 之 处 ， 使 你 享 福 吗 ？ [kjv] Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee? [bbe] And Naomi, her mother-in-law, said to her, My daughter, am I not to get you a resting-place where you may be in comfort? 3:2 [hgb] 你 与 波 阿 斯 的 使 女 常 在 一 处 ， 波 阿 斯 不 是 我 们 的 亲 族 吗 ？ 他 今 夜 在 场 上 簸 大 麦 ， [kjv] And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor. [bbe] And now, is there not Boaz, our relation, with whose young women you were? See, tonight he is separating the grain from the waste in his grain-floor. 3:3 [hgb] 你 要 沐 浴 抹 膏 ， 换 上 衣 服 ， 下 到 场 上 ， 却 不 要 使 那 人 认 出 你 来 。 你 等 他 吃 喝 完 了 ， [kjv] Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking. [bbe] So take a bath, and, after rubbing your body with sweet oil, put on your best robe, and go down to the grain-floor; but do not let him see you till he has come to the end of his meal. 3:4 [hgb] 到 他 睡 的 时 候 ， 你 看 准 他 睡 的 地 方 ， 就 进 去 掀 开 他 脚 上 的 被 ， 躺 卧 在 那 里 ， 他 必 告 诉 你 所 当 做 的 事 。 [kjv] And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do. [bbe] But see to it, when he goes to rest, that you take note of the place where he is sleeping, and go in there, and, uncovering his feet, take your place by him; and he will say what you are to do. 3:5 [hgb] 路 得 说 ， 凡 你 所 吩 咐 的 ， 我 必 遵 行 。 [kjv] And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do. [bbe] And she said, I will do all you say. 3:6 [hgb] 路 得 就 下 到 场 上 ， 照 她 婆 婆 所 吩 咐 她 的 而 行 。 [kjv] And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her. [bbe] So she went down to the grain-floor and did all her mother-in-law had said to her. 3:7 [hgb] 波 阿 斯 吃 喝 完 了 ， 心 里 欢 畅 ， 就 去 睡 在 麦 堆 旁 边 。 路 得 便 悄 悄 地 来 掀 开 他 脚 上 的 被 ， 躺 卧 在 那 里 。 [kjv] And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down. [bbe] Now when Boaz had taken meat and drink, and his heart was glad, he went to take his rest at the end of the mass of grain; then she came softly and, uncovering his feet, went to rest. 3:8 [hgb] 到 了 夜 半 ， 那 人 忽 然 惊 醒 ， 翻 过 身 来 ， 不 料 有 女 子 躺 在 他 的 脚 下 。 [kjv] And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet. [bbe] Now in the middle of the night, the man awaking from his sleep in fear, and lifting himself up, saw a woman stretched at his feet. 3:9 [hgb] 他 就 说 ， 你 是 谁 。 回 答 说 ， 我 是 你 的 婢 女 路 得 。 求 你 用 你 的 衣 襟 遮 盖 我 ， 因 为 你 是 我 一 个 至 近 的 亲 属 。 [kjv] And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman. [bbe] And he said, Who are you? And she answering said, I am your servant Ruth: take your servant as wife, for you are a near relation. 3:10 [hgb] 波 阿 斯 说 ， 女 儿 阿 ， 愿 你 蒙 耶 和 华 赐 福 。 你 末 后 的 恩 比 先 前 更 大 。 因 为 少 年 人 无 论 贫 富 ， 你 都 没 有 跟 从 。 [kjv] And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich. [bbe] And he said, May the Lord give you his blessing, my daughter: even better than what you did at the first is this last kind act you have done, in not going after young men, with or without wealth. 3:11 [hgb] 女 儿 阿 ， 现 在 不 要 惧 怕 ， 凡 你 所 说 的 ， 我 必 照 着 行 。 我 本 城 的 人 都 知 道 你 是 个 贤 德 的 女 子 。 [kjv] And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman. [bbe] And now, my daughter, have no fear; I will do for you whatever you say: for it is clear to all my townspeople that you are a woman of virtue. 3:12 [hgb] 我 实 在 是 你 一 个 至 近 的 亲 属 ， 只 是 还 有 一 个 人 比 我 更 近 。 [kjv] And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I. [bbe] Now it is true that I am a near relation: but there is a relation nearer than I. 3:13 [hgb] 你 今 夜 在 这 里 住 宿 ， 明 早 他 若 肯 为 你 尽 亲 属 的 本 分 。 就 由 他 吧 。 倘 若 不 肯 ， 我 指 着 永 生 的 耶 和 华 起 誓 ， 我 必 为 你 尽 了 本 分 ， 你 只 管 躺 到 天 亮 。 [kjv] Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman\u0027s part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning. [bbe] Take your rest here tonight; and in the morning, if he will do for you what it is right for a relation to do, very well, let him do so: but if he will not, then by the living Lord I myself will do so. 3:14 [hgb] 路 得 便 在 他 脚 下 躺 到 天 快 亮 。 人 彼 此 不 能 辨 认 的 时 候 就 起 来 了 。 波 阿 斯 说 ， 不 可 使 人 知 道 有 女 子 到 场 上 来 。 [kjv] And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor. [bbe] And she took her rest at his feet till the morning: and she got up before it was light enough for one to see another. And he said, Let it not come to anyone\u0027s knowledge that the woman came to the grain-floor. 3:15 [hgb] 又 对 路 得 说 ， 打 开 你 所 披 的 外 衣 。 她 打 开 了 ， 波 阿 斯 就 撮 了 六 簸 箕 大 麦 ， 帮 她 扛 在 肩 上 ， 她 便 进 城 去 了 。 [kjv] Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city. [bbe] And he said, Take your robe, stretching it out in your hands: and she did so, and he took six measures of grain and put them into it, and gave it her to take: and she went back to the town. 3:16 [hgb] 路 得 回 到 婆 婆 那 里 ， 婆 婆 说 ， 女 儿 阿 ， 怎 么 样 了 。 路 得 就 将 那 人 向 她 所 行 的 述 说 了 一 遍 。 [kjv] And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her. [bbe] And when she came back her mother-in-law said to her, How did it go with you, my daughter? And she gave her an account of all the man had done to her. 3:17 [hgb] 又 说 ， 那 人 给 了 我 六 簸 箕 大 麦 ， 对 我 说 ， 你 不 可 空 手 回 去 见 你 的 婆 婆 。 [kjv] And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law. [bbe] And she said, He gave me these six measures of grain, saying, Do not go back to your mother-in-law with nothing in your hands. 3:18 [hgb] 婆 婆 说 ， 女 儿 阿 ， 你 只 管 安 坐 等 候 ， 看 这 事 怎 样 成 就 ， 因 为 那 人 今 日 不 办 成 这 事 必 不 休 息 。 [kjv] Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day. [bbe] Then she said, Do nothing now, my daughter, till you see what will come of this; for the man will take no rest till he has put this thing through.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/24/347.html","bookId":236,"book":{"id":236,"title":"Ruth路得记（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land.
