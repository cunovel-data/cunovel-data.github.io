{"id":16546,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III PREPARATION FOR THE ENEMY","content":"When the father had finished eating, Lodrix fed the horses, the sheep, and the goats that were waiting outside for their dinner. The mother threw the bones of the deer into the lake, through the trap-door, and laid the skin in the sun to dry. When he had made sure that everything was secure and had sent Lodrix with a message to one of the Lake-Dwellers, the chief lay down on a skin to sleep. Lodrix hurried off to do his father’s bidding. He was to say that the drawbridge must not be put down for several days, for they were afraid the Bear people might enter their village. As the chief’s son entered the hut where he was to leave his message, he saw a little baby. The baby was tied by a long cord to one of the blocks of wood to keep her from falling through the trap-door. He told the baby’s father what the chief had said and then went toward the child, who stretched out her little hands to him. Lodrix loved babies and was glad to play with this little one. He took her to the trap-door, keeping tight hold of her hand. Then he took a basket made of rushes and lowered it, through the opening, into the lake. The baby clapped her hands with glee as she saw the little fish squirming in the basket when Lodrix drew it up. Lodrix laughed, too, because the little baby was happy. The baby’s sister, who sat grinding grain in the stone mortar, looked up and smiled at the happy children. Even the mother smiled as she worked busily at the loom, where she was weaving coarse cloth from threads of flax which the Lake-Dwellers had raised on the shore of the lake. At sunset Lodrix said, “good-by” and started for home. On his way the beautiful clear moon seemed to speak to him. Lodrix stopped a moment and prayed to it; prayed that his people might be safe from their enemies on the land. As he walked along, he spoke to many people who were anxiously watching the opposite shore. They were straining their eyes for the first glimpse of the people on the land, because they feared that at nightfall these enemies might come again. Lodrix wished to join in the watch, but he was only a little boy and the chief said that he must stay at home with his mother. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2767/76334.html","bookId":1335,"book":{"id":1335,"title":"Lodrix the Little Lake Dweller","description":"简介： Many years ago, there lived in the high regions of Switzerland and France a people called the Lake-Dwellers....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2767","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:53 AM"}}
