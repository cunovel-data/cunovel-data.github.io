{"id":16551,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII WITH THE BEAR PEOPLE","content":"Tevico turned homeward, leaving the Lake-Dwellers glad that they had news of Lodrix, but sad that they must give their bronze to their enemies. Together they walked through the forest to the shore of the lake and crossed the bridge to their village. The women were crowded together, waiting for tidings of Lodrix. The chief’s wife rushed toward him crying: “Lodrix, my son! Where is he? Did you find him?” “He is safe, but in the hands of our enemy,” said the chief. “He will be returned to us at sunrise, but we must give to these people all the bronze in our village.” Turning to his people, he said: “Let us collect our treasure at once, that it may be ready in time. “Some day my son shall repay you for this great sacrifice. “Go, now, to your homes and bring the precious metal to me.” The men started off to obey the command of their chief. Slowly they walked to their huts and quietly collected what bronze they had. It was only a short time before they were again together at the chief’s hut. They entered and placed their bronze in a pile on the floor. The chief had collected his bronze too, and motioned to one of the men to put it with the rest. There were many kinds of weapons in this pile: bronze scabbards, knives with bronze handles, bronze hammers, bronze hooks, and bronze bracelets and pins which the women had given. The chief had given most of all. He had a great amount, because the people of other lake villages had often sent him presents of bronze. The people looked longingly at the treasure for a few moments, then, at the order of their chief, put it in a large skin bag ready for the messenger. All day long the Lake-Dwellers thought of Lodrix in the hands of the enemy, and they could hardly wait for the morning when he would return. In the village of the Bear tribe, Lodrix was watching and waiting for Tevico. He hoped that the messenger would find his father, and he knew that his people would give their precious bronze for his return. He almost wished that Tevico had stayed and that some other messenger had been sent, for now he was alone among his enemies. As Lodrix sat in the hut, he heard a shout, and looking up, he saw a little boy standing in the doorway. “Come out, Lodrix,” said the boy. “I am the chief’s son, and I will show you our village.” Lodrix jumped up, very glad to get out of the hut, and the two boys walked off together through the village. As they went along, Lodrix saw many strange things. He had never seen a land village before, because his people never went far from the lake. These huts were not built on piles as the lake huts were, and it seemed strange to see no water and no boats. The sheep and goats that were running about, looked very much like his own, and as they came toward Lodrix, they seemed friendly. “Come to my house,” said the little boy. “My father wishes to see you.” So the boys ran toward the largest hut in the Bear village. They were out of breath when they reached it and were glad to throw themselves on the bearskin which lay outside the door. The chief came out of the hut, and looked kindly at the two boys. He beckoned Lodrix to him, and said: “How much bronze is there in your father’s village?” Lodrix answered: “There is more bronze in the village of the Dormorants than in any other village on the lake.” “Is there more than one messenger can carry?” said the chief. “You must send a strong messenger,” said Lodrix, “for our bronze is very heavy.” The chief thought a moment, then turned to his son and said, “You may take Lodrix about the village, but do not go far, for Tevico will return at sunset.” \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2767/76339.html","bookId":1335,"book":{"id":1335,"title":"Lodrix the Little Lake Dweller","description":"简介： Many years ago, there lived in the high regions of Switzerland and France a people called the Lake-Dwellers....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2767","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:53 AM"}}
