{"id":16550,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VII THE MESSAGE","content":"Tevico had stooped down and was looking through the low doorway. “Here comes my chief!” he said. “See! He is coming toward this hut.” Lodrix looked too, and saw a large man coming toward him. As the chief came up, Lodrix said to him: “Send to my father; he will give you and your people all that you ask if you will take me home.” “We ask bronze,” said the chief. “Will your father give that?” “The chief of the Dormorants has much bronze,” said Lodrix. “He will give you all you ask if you will send a messenger to him.” “Go, Tevico,” said the chief. “Go to the chief of the Dormorants, and tell him that we hold his son a prisoner. We will not harm him and will send him home if he will give us all the bronze in his village.” Tevico bowed to his chief and ran swiftly away through the forest. He hurried onward, never stopping to look at the deer as they crossed his path or to answer the birds as they sang in the tree tops. He did not even stop to rest, though he was panting for breath. As he raced on he saw a man in the distance. When the man saw Tevico, he called loudly to him. “Our chief’s son is lost in the forest. Have you seen him?” Tevico stopped and waited till the man came near him. “Where is your chief?” the boy asked. “Is he in the forest?” The man nodded his head and pointed in an opposite direction. “I must see him. I have news of his son,” said Tevico. “Come with me, I will take you to him,” said the man eagerly, and away they both ran to find the chief. They did not speak as they ran swiftly through the forest. On their way, they met others of the Lake-Dwellers who had been searching for Lodrix. As they came up to the chief, he was looking sadly about him. All night long they had hunted, but had found no trace of the lost boy. When Tevico approached, the chief raised his eyes and looked at him with wonder. Then Tevico stood before him and said: “I bear a message from the chief of my people to the chief of the Dormorants. Your son is safe in the hands of the Bear people. “If you will give to my tribe all the bronze of your village, they will return your son to you. “If you will not give your bronze, Lodrix will be killed, because the Bear people are your enemies.” The chief listened to the words of the boy, then called his men to him. He told them what the messenger had said, then stood silent, wondering what their answer would be. The men wished to fight, but they knew fighting could not save Lodrix, for the Bear people would surely kill him. Their bronze was very precious to them and they hated to give it to their enemies, but they loved their chief and knew that Lodrix must be saved. So they said: “Chief, what we have is yours. Take our bronze if it will bring your son back to us.” Then the chief said to Tevico: “Hasten back to your chief! Tell him that the Dormorants will give to him all the bronze of their village for the safe return of Lodrix. “Tell him to send Lodrix to the shore of our lake at sunrise. A messenger will be there who will give him the bronze he asks. “Now go, Tevico, and carry my message to your chief.”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2767/76338.html","bookId":1335,"book":{"id":1335,"title":"Lodrix the Little Lake Dweller","description":"简介： Many years ago, there lived in the high regions of Switzerland and France a people called the Lake-Dwellers....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2767","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:53 AM"}}
