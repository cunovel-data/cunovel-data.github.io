{"id":16548,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V LODRIX LOST","content":"“Look!” said Lodrix, darting off toward a deer whose antlers he saw in the distance. The men smiled at one another, proud to see their chief’s son fond of the hunt. They did not follow, for they wished to see if Lodrix could kill the deer alone. They turned toward a mound which held the tomb where their former chiefs were buried. This tomb was a small stone room which the Lake-Dwellers had built, and then covered with soil. They thought of the time when they had carried Lodrix’s grandfather to this stone room. The men had stood about with lighted torches, and the women with their hair hanging over their faces had shed many bitter tears for the dead chief. Then, after they had put the bronze and stone weapons beside their chief, they had gathered about the hill and chosen a new one. They always chose for their new chief the bravest and strongest man of all the tribe. The brave and strong chief they chose that day was Lodrix’s father. For a time the men had forgotten Lodrix, then one of them said: “Lodrix has not come back. Where can he be?” They looked about, but could see no trace of their chief’s son. With fear in their hearts, they separated and ran in many directions through the forest. They shouted, “Lodrix! Lodrix!” but their calls were not answered. They did not stop to shoot the deer, but ran on and on, so anxious were they to find the boy. Again and again they called, but no answer came. They could not find Lodrix, and yet they dared not go home without him. All day the men hunted for Lodrix, shouting the boy’s name as loudly as they could. At nightfall they stood on the shore of the lake looking toward their village and wondering how they could tell their chief that his son was lost. Silently they walked toward the bridge and with bowed heads they crossed it. When they reached the round hut of their chief, they stood quite still, fearing to go in. The chief, who had been watching for his son, came out of the low door. “What is the matter?” he said. “Where is Lodrix?” The men stood silent. They could not answer. “My son! Where is my son?” Then one of the men said, “He is lost in the forest, my chief. We looked for him all day, but could not find him.” The chief raised his hands to the moon, praying that his son might be found. Then he asked the men for the whole story. It was but a few minutes before all the men in the village were roused and a hunting party started out to look for their chief’s son. Some of the men stayed to guard the homes, but the chief went with the hunting party. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2767/76336.html","bookId":1335,"book":{"id":1335,"title":"Lodrix the Little Lake Dweller","description":"简介： Many years ago, there lived in the high regions of Switzerland and France a people called the Lake-Dwellers....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2767","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:53 AM"}}
