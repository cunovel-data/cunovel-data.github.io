I figure most of you realize by now that we’re seeing each other. Olivia, you know how to manage the Horse Farm. You take over. I’ll do my twenty-four hours in here. After that, I’ll rest at my place for another twenty-four. Then we’ll see where we are.” Olivia inhaled and exhaled slowly. “Aaron, there may not be a lot to manage. We’re starting to lose clients—guests.” Aaron stared at her. “What do we do?” he asked thickly. “Find whoever is doing this,” Dustin said. “There had to be someone else in the woods with us,” Aaron insisted. “That is a possibility,” Frank said. “Will you let Sandra come in now? Please?” “Yes, fine, we can do that,” Frank told him. Olivia gave Aaron a kiss on the forehead. He looked up at her and smiled. “You’ll fix it, kid. I know you will.” I don’t know, Aaron! I don’t know. She didn’t say the words out loud. She offered him what she hoped was an encouraging smile and followed Dustin and Frank out of the room. As Frank spoke to the deputy who’d been assigned to watch the room, Dustin told Sandra she could go in. She walked by Olivia, looking as if she’d like to scratch her eyes out. Olivia didn’t believe Sandra would harm Aaron in any way. But, at that moment, she thought the woman would have gladly strangled her. 12 “We’re going to reschedule all our weekend appointments,” Olivia said. They’d returned to the Horse Farm and she was speaking to Mason, Mariah, Sydney and Drew. Dustin leaned against the wall, watching as she spoke. Sammy had taken up a position at her feet. She’d announced that the police suspected the situation that plagued them might have nothing to do with a relapse and an accident. The room had already buzzed with protests and disbelief. But now, the group was subdued and concerned. “If they’ll reschedule. If anyone even comes back,” Mason said glumly. “We’ll hope for the best,” Olivia responded. “If they don’t reschedule, we’ll be understanding, and we’ll tell them we hope they’ll come back in the future. We’ll explain that we don’t know what’s going on, but—” Olivia paused, looking over at Dustin “—but the authorities will discover the truth very soon.” “So, what do you want us to do, Olivia?” Drew asked. “You and Sydney do what you always do—tend to the horses. And the cats and dogs and...I think that’s all we have right now.” “If we close down, though,” Mariah said, “don’t we look like we’re guilty of something?” Olivia shook her head. “No. We look like we’re concerned about all our guests and we want to make sure we’re providing an entirely safe environment for them.” “Maybe we should start looking for work,” Mariah said. “If you feel you need to move on, everyone here will understand,” Olivia told her. “I’m not jumping ship! I’m just thinking about it,” Mariah added quickly. “The Horse Farm is all right for now. We can make it for a while with all the trusts and provisions in the will. I’ll call the attorney and let him know where we are,” Olivia said. “I’m expecting Aaron will be back in the office by Tuesday. We can try to reschedule our sessions for next week.” Mariah excused herself as her cell phone rang. She stepped into the games room to take the call. “What should we be doing?” Mason asked Olivia. “I mean—no offense, guys—but this is easier for Sydney and Drew. They just keep looking after the place and the animals. But for you and me and Mariah...” Olivia smiled at him. “Mason, why don’t you get some new modeling shots done? See if there’s any extra work in the area for the next few days.” Mason looked back at her and then laughed. “You know what I’ve never done? Visited the Hermitage. It’s almost anti-American to be this close to Nashville and not have visited the Hermitage. Old Hickory’s homestead! I think I’ll do that tomorrow.” “Good plan!” Olivia said. Mariah stepped back into the room, her eyes wide. “You’re not going to believe this.” “What?” Olivia asked. “I just got a call—” “People want to support us, right?” Mason interrupted. “They’re trying to book sessions, anyway!” “Uh, no, I’m sorry,” Mariah said, frowning. “That was the agency that sets up ghost tours for me. They say they’re getting constant calls from tourists who want to come out here and go on ghost tours!” “Great,” Mason said. “No, not great,” Sydney said, frowning. “Sounds like people just want to see where Marcus died, along with Civil War ghosts. That’s ghoulish, not great.” “Oh, Sydney, I wouldn’t tell stories about Marcus!” “And you don’t think it would come up? That people wouldn’t ask you where Marcus Danby died?” Mason demanded. “And where Aaron Bentley almost died?” Drew asked quietly. Mariah stared at them all. “Hey, guys, I’ve always done ghost tours. History tours.” “I think it’s fine, Mariah,” Olivia said. “You give great history tours and you have for a long time. Just don’t book anything until Aaron’s back on Tuesday. Not tonight, though. We’re all drained.” Mariah nodded. “Of course. I agree, tonight would be bad. And they’re not my horses. They belong to the farm, and one of you guys usually comes with me and sometimes we camp.... But I’m definitely not camping again for a while! Anyway, it’s all on hold.” Mason stood up. “I’m going home—at my own risk, mind you. Call me if there’s anything new or if you need me. Oh, it’s okay if we go see Aaron?” “Yes, of course,” Olivia said. Mason started to walk out, but stopped and looked directly at Dustin. “What do you make of all this?” “I don’t know yet. That’s why I suggest you all stay in public places, hang around in groups—and watch your backs,” Dustin told him. “Yeah, yeah, thanks,” Mason muttered. When he reached the door, he paused and turned back. “Someone want to walk me to my car?” he asked. Dustin smiled, pushed away from the wall and said, “Sure.” “Hey, I’ll take off, too,” Mariah said, rushing over. “Not that I think anyone would be after me. Or you, Mason. But then, I wouldn’t have thought anyone would be after Aaron....” She stared at Olivia. “You should be careful, Olivia. Really careful. I mean, if things go in order... Marcus, Aaron—you. Oh, Liv! I can’t believe I just said that. Hey, you want to come and stay with me?” Dustin stepped in. “Olivia will be all right. I’ll be watching over her,” he said. Mariah started to smile. Her lips twitched as if she was about to make a sexual innuendo. She didn’t. “Good.” She waved at Drew and Sydney. “We won’t just desert you two. I’ll be here tomorrow.” “Thanks, Mariah,” Drew said. “Ditto,” Sydney told her. Mariah brightened. “Aaron is fine—and that’s the main thing, right? By next week, we’ll be back up to speed. I just know it!” Her words seemed to fall into empty space. Then Drew gave it a try. “Sure, Mariah.” Dustin walked Mariah and Mason out the door and toward the parking lot. Both hesitated as they stepped outside, looking out over the rolling pasture. “This place is so beautiful,” Mason said, his voice reverential. Mariah nodded. “So, Dustin—even Deputy Vine thinks something odd is going on. But in a court of law, wouldn’t we be looking at a bunch of circumstances? As opposed to solid evidence? Sorry, I guess I watch too much crime TV.” “I’m into being safe and if Frank wants us to be safe—well, I’m there,” Mason said. “See you all. Thanks, Secret Agent Man.” Dustin didn’t bother to protest. “Take care, Mason.” “Will do!” Mason promised. He walked to his car. Mariah started walking to hers; by the end, she was running. She hopped in, revved the engine and lifted a hand to show that she was on her way. He walked back into the office. Olivia, Drew and Sydney glanced up at him expectantly. “What do we do now?” Drew asked him. “Find a killer,” Dustin said. 13 “That was pretty blunt,” Olivia told Dustin as they drove away from the Horse Farm. His rental car was staying there. They were driving to her place. Together. Sammy was with them, of course. The dog was in the backseat but his head appeared between them every few seconds, despite Olivia’s suggestion that he stay in the back. Dustin had a feeling that she was usually a little more authoritative with the dog, but she was tired. Worn out. And she was feeling guilty about Sammy. “Blunt? Perhaps. Not much else to say at this point, though.” He turned to look at her. “Whoever is doing this has to be in your group. And you did the best thing you could have done—stopping all sessions until Aaron’s back. If Aaron makes it back.” Olivia gripped the wheel and glanced his way quickly. “First of all, canceling our sessions wasn’t entirely my choice. And what do you mean, if Aaron makes it back? He looked great. They’re just keeping him for observation.” “He’s keen to get out of the hospital. He almost died, Olivia. According to him, he heard a ‘mosquito’ buzz and went down immediately after that. He’s not a stupid man. He listened to what Frank and I had to say, but he just wanted to see Sandra and get out. The sheriff’s department doesn’t have the manpower to put a guard on everyone at the Horse Farm, so I’m hoping he and Sandra stay together. For now, Aaron is fine. However, I don’t know what’ll happen when they release him—even if Sandra never lets him out of her sight.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-is-forever-krewe-of-hunters-11/page-34.html","bookId":2285,"book":{"id":2285,"title":"The Night Is Forever (Krewe of Hunters #11)","description":"Storyline: The Night Is Forever (Krewe of Hunters #11) A Ghost Rider in the Sky?
