It is unfortunate that I should at this time be detained by pressing legal matters which demand an expeditious response. I ask that you excuse me, and I trust that you will understand my predicament and not judge me too harshly for circumstances that are beyond my control. I am confident you will receive her respectfully for her children\u0027s sake.\\n\\n Your daughter-in-law has with her not only the coachman, but her maid and an escort of two armed men whose purpose it is to protect her from any harm that may threaten her. They will all bring her to Ravensberg, where I will once again meet her at the conclusion of her visit with you. She is carrying a small box of uncut gems that are my present to you, as well as a pair of etchings from the last century showing two perspectives of Salzburg, which is her gift to her children. She herself brings a case of brandy for you.\\n\\n I hope that this finds you well; may this year bring you good health, good harvests, the good-will of our neighbors, and contentment for all who dwell under your roof,\\n\\n Most sincerely,\\n\\n Saint-Germain Ragoczy\\n\\n Comte Franciscus\\n\\n (his sigil, the eclipse) \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/borne-in-blood-saint-germain-20/page-20.html","bookId":2503,"book":{"id":2503,"title":"Borne in Blood (Saint-Germain #20)","description":"Storyline: Borne in Blood (Saint-Germain #20) \\n The year is 1817. In Switzerland, the Count Saint-Germain leads a comfortable life with his paramour Hero whose husband died fighting Napoleon. Saint-Germain\u0027s loving kindness cannot keep Hero from missing her children who are being raised by their hard-hearted grandfather. \\n The Count has become intrigued by the work of an Austrian noble investigating the properties of blood, a subject always of key interest to a vampire. But when the noble\u0027s beautiful ward fixates sexually on the Count, the vampire fears for himself and his gentle lover. \\n With Borne in Blood, Chelsea Quinn Yarbro\u0027s saga of Count Saint-Germain, reaches a milestone--the twentieth volume of the vampire\u0027s adventures. The Saint-Germain cycle is one of our age\u0027s most compelling bodies of work of dark fantasy and horror, and the longest running series of vampire novels. Historically accurate, these deeply emotional novels have a devoted readership. Recognizing her impact on the genre, the International Horror Guild named Chelsea Quinn Yarbro a Living Legend at the World Fantasy Convention in 2006.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/borne-in-blood-saint-germain-20.jpg","author":"Chelsea Quinn Yarbro","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/borne-in-blood-saint-germain-20.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:01:51 PM"}}
