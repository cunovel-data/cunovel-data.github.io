{"id":106740,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"\"That child is back,\" said Hero as she looked out the window of the reception room at the front of Ragoczy\u0027s Amsterdam house. \"Walking unattended, at the height of the morning when half of Amsterdam is abroad, and without a carriage to accompany her.\" She frowned. \"No-wait; she\u0027s not alone. Gutesohnes is with her.\"\n Ragoczy, at the secretary on the far side of this sunny chamber, continued to review the pages in his hands. \"Is he.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know if his being with her is better or worse than if she were walking alone. Silly, isn\u0027t it? Her own coachman would be more than acceptable, but I don\u0027t think Gutesohnes is. The Dutch aren\u0027t as strict as the Austrians, but this is still beyond the acceptable bounds of what young single ladies may do,\" said Hero. \"Not that I am for all the limitations imposed on women: I am not. Yet it is folly to flout them, or to fly in the face of convention. For girls like her, some allowance may be made for high spirits. Still, if she wants to be careful of her reputation ...\"\n \"That seems to be a concern of her guardian, and one for which he is strangely lax,\" said Ragoczy, thinking back to the way Hyacinthie had behaved two nights ago, making a display of herself while her uncle entertained four booksellers and Ragoczy in anticipation of the publication of his book.\n \"Her uncle, if I may say so, pays little heed to Hyacinthie. He is far more concerned for his book than for her.\"\n \"Without doubt,\" said Ragoczy.\n \"It must be difficult for her,\" said Hero musingly. \"To be attractive and yet to live in the shadow of her uncle\u0027s study.\"\n \"And to live in the isolation of Ravensberg-no wonder she flaunts herself here, while she has the opportunity.\"\n \"She is a flirt,\" Hero declared, watching Hyacinthie twirl her parasol as she looked up at Gutesohnes.\n \"Hardly surprising: she is young and her uncle is determined to sell her to the highest bidder or most high-born-to that extent he is concerned for her at all.\" Ragoczy frowned as he said this, his sympathy going out to the young woman even as he considered her predicament. \"She is attempting to secure herself.\"\n \"If that is the case, she would do better not to flirt with the coachman.\" Hero laughed, a little sadly. \"But I understand you-she is practicing, isn\u0027t she?\"\n Ragoczy put the pages aside and came to the divan where Hero was sitting. He lifted the curtain. \"Ah. I see what you mean,\" he agreed. \"Practicing, indeed.\"\n \"Such a pretty child,\" said Hero. \"But so determined to ensnare every man she sees. That may yet bring her to grief.\" She rounded on Ragoczy. \"She will probably try to engage your attention.\"\n \"She already has, upon two occasions at least,\" said Ragoczy with a single shake of his head.\n \"She has?\" Hero said, not entirely surprised.\n \"Yes,\" he responded. \"I was certain you had noticed: once at the reception we attended, and once when she came with her uncle to Eclipse Press. I would not be astonished to learn that her uncle encourages her.\"\n Hero pulled the curtain out of his hand and settled back on the divan. \"She\u0027s coming this way.\"\n \"Paying a visit?\" he ventured, and went on in a singularly neutral tone, \"How ... how charming.\"\n She gave him a short, uncertain look. \"You\u0027re displeased.\"\n \"I am uneasy,\" he said as he heard the knocker sound, and Kuyskill go down the hall to open the door.\n \"Do you suppose she will-\" Hero began, then fell silent as she heard Hyacinthie ask for Comte Franciscus.\n Ragoczy held up his hand in caution, and moved back to the small secretary where the pages he had been examining were stacked.\n \"-from my uncle, Graf von Ravensberg,\" Hyacinthie\u0027s raised voice sounded from the entryway; she spoke in French.\n \"I do not know that the Comte is home to visitors. I will inquire.\" Kuyskill\u0027s tone made it clear he disapproved of young ladies paying visits without escorts. \"If you will wait?\" Giving her no time to answer, he left her standing on the front steps and came into the reception room. \"Comte,\" he said apologetically, \"there is a caller, who claims she brings a letter from the Graf von Ravensberg. Shall I admit her or send her-\"\n \"Admit her, by all means,\" said Ragoczy. \"And bring a glass of lemonade to her. On a warm day like this, she must be thirsty.\"\n Kuyskill pokered up, but nodded. \"Of course, Comte.\" He turned to leave the room.\n \"You see what I mean; the servants will call her a hoyden,\" said Hero quietly.\n \"All but Gutesohnes,\" said Ragoczy, equally softly.\n \"That will only make it worse,\" said Hero, and rose to welcome Hyacinthie to the house.\n Hyacinthie, her flower-patterned parasol furled, stood in the doorway, resplendent in a fashionable walking dress of sprigged muslin in a pale shade of lavender accented with knots of blue-green floss at the neck and cuffs. Her bonnet was abbreviated, showing more of her dark-blond hair than was thought fitting for her age and position in society. She bobbed a polite curtsy to Ragoczy, then to Hero as Kuyskill announced her in disapproving accents. \"Good morning,\" she said when the steward had withdrawn from the reception room.\n \"And to you, Fraulein Sieffert,\" said Ragoczy, using French for everything but her title and name. \"To what do we owe this pleasure?\"\n \"I have a note from my uncle that he charged me to bring to you.\" She held out her lace-mittened hand, proffering a small envelope of cream-laid paper on which Ragoczy\u0027s name had been written with a flourish. \"He instructed me to wait for an answer.\"\n \"It is urgent, then?\" Ragoczy inquired as he took the envelope and broke the seal.\n \"Yes. We are leaving the day after tomorrow, you see,\" she said with a blinding smile. \"We return to Ravensberg.\"\n \"A considerable journey,\" said Hero. \"You must be busy, making preparations.\"\n \"The hotel is doing everything for us. My uncle and his valet are supervising. I was in the way until I was given this task to perform.\" She looked a bit forlorn. \"I will miss Amsterdam.\"\n \"I should think so,\" said Hero. \"It is exciting to see new places and meet new people.\"\n \"Especially when I do not often get to receive guests or travel.\" Hyacinthie sighed. \"Visitors come rarely to Ravensberg. Except for the people who call in so my uncle may study their blood, we go from year to year seeing the same twenty faces. And the servants, of course.\"\n \"Not an easy thing for a young woman,\" Hero sympathized.\n \"Not what I would prefer,\" said Hyacinthie in a rush. \"It would be so much nicer to go to parties and balls in Vienna, or even Salzburg. But my uncle cannot spare the time or the money from his research.\"\n Hero had sat down again, and now indicated the chair at the end of the divan; she did her best to make the girl feel welcome. \"Do have a seat, Hyacinthie, and tell me more about yourself. We haven\u0027t had much of an opportunity to become acquainted. The Comte will finish reading your uncle\u0027s note and he will prepare an answer for you to take back to him.\" She smiled encouragement even as she noticed Hyacinthie\u0027s ill-concealed disappointment at not acquiring all of Ragoczy\u0027s attention. \"For how long have you lived with your uncle?\"\n \"There is little to tell about my life,\" said Hyacinthie. \"My parents died when I was seven and my uncle took me in. He has cared for me ever since.\" Under her gentle words there was an implacable note, something hard that turned her remark bitter. \"Now he will find me a husband. He says he has to do so. He has two other wards, younger than I am, to care for.\"\n Hero was spared the necessity of responding to Hyacinthie\u0027s revelations by Kuyskill coming into the reception room with a glass of lemonade and a plate of sweet biscuits on a tray. He bowed as he put this on the occasional table between the divan and the chair, then withdrew, radiating disapproval.\n When the steward was gone, Ragoczy said, \"The Graf has kindly invited me to attend a celebration for the publication of his book in November. I am going to request that he send an invitation when he has set the time of the festivities, and if it is possible, to do my utmost to attend, weather and business permitting.\" He drew a sheet of fine rag paper out of a shelf in the secretary and moved the stacks of paper aside so he could write a response to von Ravensberg.\n \"Have your refreshments,\" Hero recommended to Hyacinthie. \"I don\u0027t care for sweet biscuits, and the lemonade was requested for you.\"\n Hyacinthie picked up the glass, saying, \"I am of an age that I prefer wine,\" before she took a sip. \"I\u0027m sure you prefer wine, Comte.\" This last was accompanied by a sidelong glance at her host.\n Ragoczy was busy selecting a trimmed quill for his pen, so it took him a short while to answer. \"I am afraid I do not drink wine.\"\n Hyacinthie blinked. \"Never?\"\n \"Not since I was a very young man,\" he said, his memories of his long-ago breathing life flitting through his recollections; he retrieved the ink-well from its drawer, setting it in the rack provided for it.\n \"Oh.\" She picked up one of the sweet biscuits, broke it in half, and chose the larger of the two to set down again. \"Your cook makes these?\"\n \"Yes, he does,\" said Ragoczy, continuing to write.\n \"Wine doesn\u0027t agree with him,\" Hero explained.\n \"Oh,\" said Hyacinthie again, and took a bite of her biscuit.\n \"We will be leaving shortly, as well,\" Hero went on. \"I share your aversion to long hours in a coach, but I prefer it to the same hours on a horse or on foot.\"\n Hyacinthie nodded. When she had swallowed, she said, \"It is so hot in the coach. But it is probably just as hot riding or walking.\"\n \"Hotter, I fear,\" said Hero. \"When I traveled with my father, I often longed for a coach. We were lucky to have open wagons to transport us and our things.\"\n Hyacinthie stared at her. \"Your father was with the army?\"\n \"No, my father is a professor of antiquities. He has been on many expeditions into Ottoman lands; I have accompanied him when I was younger.\" In spite of herself, Hero found Hyacinthie\u0027s fascination flattering. \"Before I was married, I sometimes traveled with him.\"\n \"Into Ottoman lands?\" Hyacinthie\u0027s voice rose four notes. \"Truly? What was it like? Did handsome Turks seek to woo you? Did you walk in perfumed gardens surrounded by beautiful birds and pet tigers?\"\n \"It was dusty,\" said Hero, feeling she owed it to the child to divest her experiences of any tinge of romance. \"Often hot, sometimes windy. When we were among Muslims, we were forced to go swathed and veiled as their women do, and the people most often avoided us because we were from Europe. Many times we had poor food and brackish water, and no means of gaining other supplies. The local villagers would not sell food to us, and there were no hostelries for us, so we lived in tents. My father could find no tobacco for his pipe. The Muslims do not drink wine, just as the Comte doesn\u0027t, so no wine was to be had.\"\n \"How exciting!\" Hyacinthie gulped down half of the lemonade. \"How grand! Not the lack of wine, of course, or the other problems,\" she added, \"but everything else. How wonderful!\"\n \"How hot and inconvenient,\" said Hero, correcting her. \"You wouldn\u0027t enjoy it at all. I didn\u0027t.\"\n \"But you must have,\" said Hyacinthie in astonished reproach. \"You must have known that what you were doing was extraordinary. Didn\u0027t you?\"\n Hero thought a moment. \"Well, yes, from a certain point of view, it was. But in terms of how we lived, it was far from pleasant or remarkable, except for the discommodation. I would have traded half of the wonders for a reliable bath, a chance to wear my own clothes, and freedom from flies.\"\n \"But ... you must have liked some of it,\" Hyacinthie protested, then added, \"Well, flies, yes. No one likes flies.\"\n \"And we lived in tents that were stifling in the day and cold at night, and filled with dust.\" Hero smiled briefly. \"I am glad to have seen as much of the world as I have, but I do not claim that the experience was delightful.\n Again Hyacinthie nodded. \"It may be that you didn\u0027t appreciate all he had done for you.\"\n \"I believe I did,\" said Hero. \"At least sufficiently to know it wasn\u0027t the way I wanted to live all my days.\"\n Hyacinthie drank the last of her lemonade and said with determination. \"I would never slight such a splendid adventure. I would thank my father for providing so much for me, even if I were sometimes uncomfortable. I would not be ungrateful. I wouldn\u0027t ignore my obligation to my father; I would make myself useful to him at every opportunity.\" She almost got to her feet while she struggled with her growing indignation.\n \"My dear Fraulein Sieffert,\" said Hero quickly, holding out her hand to her guest. \"I had no intention of distressing you.\" She sat a bit straighter. \"I am deeply grateful to my father for including me in his expedition. I don\u0027t think I could have endured having to stay in the care of relatives or the nuns. But that doesn\u0027t mean that all was unalloyed delight and wonders, or that it was an experience that I am eager to repeat, for that would not be the case. I am content to remain in Europe for the rest of my days rather than face the demands of an expedition in Ottoman lands. Most of what we did was drudgery, as daily life is for almost all of humanity.\"\n \"You must not speak against your father, you know,\" Hyacinthie said forcefully. \"He has done you a great honor by permitting you to go with him on his travels.\"\n \"My father is a remarkable man, very learned. He has lectured in France and England-he gave me an English name because he liked it better than the Italian version-and he has published eight books, three in Italian, one in English, three in French, one in German.\" She made no attempt to disguise her pride in him. \"I am a fortunate woman to be his daughter.\"\n \"Very fortunate,\" said Hyacinthie darkly.\n \"And I was mindful of all the opportunities he provided me, before I was married.\"\n \"Yes. My uncle told me you were a widow. That\u0027s sad.\" Hyacinthie regarded her in sudden concentration, as if she were seeing Hero for the first time. \"Your husband was a soldier?\"\n \"An engineer, but part of Napoleon\u0027s forces, and committed to social reform. He was primarily employed in assessing fortifications that had been damaged, with the intention of recommending repairs or demolition. He didn\u0027t live to see his idol come to his inglorious end.\" She said this so calmly that she felt a bit shocked; a year ago she could not have spoken so tranquilly of Fridhold. \"He was injured in his work six years ago, and the fever that followed killed him.\"\n \"That must have been very upsetting for you, losing him in that way,\" said Hyacinthie in apparent indifference.\n To her astonishment, Hero heard herself say, \"It spared him the Russian Campaign.\"\n Hyacinthie blinked. \"Yes,\" she said slowly. \"But he died, so why does the how of it matter?\" She looked toward Ragoczy, to see if he was listening.\n \"Fraulein!\" Hero exclaimed.\n At this point Ragoczy intervened. \"You know how hard it was when your parents died, Fraulein Sieffert. This was just such a loss for my friend and her children.\" He blotted the answer he had just completed very gently, taking care not to smear the edges of the note.\n \"You have children?\" Hyacinthie asked.\n \"Three sons and a daughter. They are with my husband\u0027s father.\" She stopped herself from revealing anything more.\n \"Three sons and a daughter,\" marveled Hyacinthie. \"Tell me about them.\"\n \"My oldest son is eleven, then twin boys who are nine, and my daughter, who is eight,\" said Hero.\n \"They must provide consolation for you,\" said Hyacinthie because it was expected of her, and because she sensed that Hero missed her family.\n \"When I see them,\" said Hero distantly. \"Siegfried will soon be going off to school. He\u0027s the oldest.\"\n Ragoczy folded the note and wrote Graf von Ravensberg in his neat hand on the envelope. \"I thank you for serving as the messenger for your guardian, Fraulein Sieffert. If you will extend your goodness and take this to him on my behalf? Thank you.\" He reached for the sealing wax, and struck the hanging flint-and-steel to light the wick embedded in the wax.\n Hyacinthie beamed at him. \"It is my privilege.\" She could not keep the satisfaction out of her voice.\n As the wick flared, Ragoczy turned the stick of wax, encouraging a small drop to fall onto the back of the envelope. \"I hope your uncle is satisfied with his book now.\"\n \"He said the necessary corrections had been made,\" said Hyacinthie.\n \"Then I hope he will be gratified by the discussion it engenders when it is published,\" Ragoczy said, pressing his signet-ring into the wax and leaving an impression of the eclipse. He waved the envelope twice to be sure the wax was cool.\n \"And I hope you will have a pleasant journey back to Ravensberg,\" added Hero.\n \"It is a long journey to make,\" said Hyacinthie, rising to take the sealed envelope Ragoczy held out to her. \"I don\u0027t know when I shall see Amsterdam again.\"\n \"Let us hope you may come here before too many years have passed,\" said Ragoczy. \"It is a city that improves with revisiting, more so now that the Netherlands have become a proper country again.\"\n \"Will you come here again, Comte?\" Hyacinthie asked so coquettishly that Ragoczy had to stifle a laugh as he exchanged a quick glance with Hero.\n \"I have business here, so it is very likely that I will,\" said Ragoczy. He bowed slightly to Hyacinthie. \"Would you like one of my servants to accompany you back to your hotel?\"\n \"It isn\u0027t far, and I want to purchase some muslin and lawn on my way. But thank you for your concern.\" She tilted her head and achieved a shy smile. She slipped the envelope into her silver-link reticule. \"I will hand this to my uncle the instant I see him.\"\n \"You\u0027re most kind,\" said Ragoczy as he moved toward the open parlor door. \"Convey my greetings to the Graf.\"\n Hyacinthie was reluctant to leave, walking slowly and sighing once. \"Thank you for the lemonade and biscuits.\"\n Ragoczy bowed once more. \"A pleasure, Fraulein.\"\n Kuyskill appeared in the entry-hall as if conjured from the air. He guided Hyacinthie toward the door, opened it for her, and stood watching her open her parasol and descend to the street. Only then did he close the door and say to Ragoczy, \"She is up to mischief, Comte.\"\n \"Not mischief, but she is after more than a note for her uncle,\" said Ragoczy. He was about to go back to the secretary when Kuyskill went on.\n \"Rogier is back from the docks and has an inventory for you. Shall I send him in?\"\n Ragoczy looked at Hero. \"Will you excuse me a moment?\"\n \"I will excuse you as long as you need,\" she replied with a wave of her hand. \"I have to write to my children before we leave, and now is a good time to do it.\"\n \"Thank you,\" said Ragoczy, falling in behind Kuyskill.\n \"You should have sent a servant with that young woman. She shouldn\u0027t be out on the streets alone like that,\" said Kuyskill, making no apology for addressing his employer so critically.\n \"I do not disagree, but she refused escort, so what can I do?\" Ragoczy countered. \"Her guardian is careless with her; I cannot offend him by forcing my servant upon her.\"\n Kuyskill nodded slowly. \"Probably so,\" he allowed as he opened the door to Ragoczy\u0027s study where Rogier was waiting. \"I still don\u0027t like to think of her, unaccompanied.\"\n But Hyacinthie was not alone on her erratic course back to the hotel: Otto Gutesohnes was at her side, deferential and gallant all at once. He had donned a long duster-coat and threaded two lashes through the buttonhole to show off his occupation, and carried his wide-brimmed coachman\u0027s hat in his hand; he stayed by her side as she dawdled past shops and vendors\u0027 stalls.\n \"So you must tell me: how long have you driven for the Comte?\" Hyacinthie asked as Gutesohnes escorted her over a narrow bridge; she spoke in German and she smiled provocatively as she asked.\n \"I haven\u0027t worked for him very long. I am his courier. His coachman broke his leg so I am taking his place until he is healed.\" He returned her smile.\n \"Courier? You carry messages for him?\" She knew the answer but wanted to keep him talking.\n \"Messages, dispatches, books, whatever he asks,\" said Gutesohnes.\n \"That means you travel alone?\"\n \"From time to time,\" he answered cautiously, not sure what she intended and not wanting to spoil such a promising flirtation.\n \"He must trust you, to send you on such missions.\"\n \"He has allowed me to prove myself,\" said Gutesohnes.\n \"How far have you gone for him?\" She twirled her parasol.\n \"Oh, to Heidelberg and to Koln thus far, with stops along the way in both instances.\" He waited. \"I may be sent to Praha in the fall.\"\n \"Would your travels, perhaps, bring you to Austria-to Salzburg, perhaps?\" There was no mistaking her intention now. \"My uncle is often preoccupied with his studies, and I might be able to slip away to the gamekeeper\u0027s cottage, if I knew I could meet you there.\"\n He had not expected such a direct invitation, and so he walked on in silence for a short distance. Finally he said, \"I would not want to compromise you in anyway, Fraulein.\"\n \"No one would know,\" she said. \"I can send you a note, telling you where the cottage is, and-you do read, don\u0027t you?\"\n \"Yes,\" he said. \"I\u0027m no scholar, but I am not a dolt, either.\"\n She beamed. \"Then we can write to one another.\"\n \"But your guardian wouldn\u0027t approve, would he,\" said Gutesohnes, halting as three dogs came trotting up to them, noses busy.\n \"That doesn\u0027t matter. I\u0027ll give you the direction for my governess; she will receive notes for me.\"\n \"And she\u0027ll tell your uncle,\" said Gutesohnes, ever more certain that this was too reckless. He coughed discreetly. \"You shouldn\u0027t be involved in anything clandestine.\"\n She slapped playfully at his arm. \"You\u0027re much too discreet for that, aren\u0027t you?\"\n Gutesohnes shook his head. \"I fear for you. It isn\u0027t fitting that you should engage in anything that would smirch your reputation, particularly not at your age, when the Graf is seeking to find you a husband.\"\n \"Smirch my reputation?\" she mocked, thinking of all the nights she had passed with her uncle in her bed. \"If no one knows,\" she said patiently, \"it means nothing.\"\n \"But a rumor could ruin you,\" he cautioned her.\n \"I don\u0027t care,\" she announced.\n \"You should care,\" he said. \"You can throw away all your happiness in the world in a foolish gesture.\" He knew this was true, but he was flattered that she would take such a chance on his behalf. \"Save your acts of defiance for a man who is worthy of your hand.\"\n Her laughter was high and harsh. \"You don\u0027t know, do you?\" She glared at him through a smile. \"No, you don\u0027t know.\"\n Startled at her change in demeanor, Gutesohnes hesitated. \"Know what, Fraulein? I don\u0027t understand.\"\n \"No,\" she said, ignoring him. \"You have no notion. None at all.\"\n \"Notion about what?\" he pursued, confused and nonplussed.\n \"Nothing! You wouldn\u0027t understand in any case,\" she declared, and walked more quickly, forcing him to hurry after her along the street that bordered the canal until they reached the Majestic Hotel, where her uncle was preparing to depart. At last she slowed and was willing to look at him once more, this time with her seductive smile firmly in place. \"You\u0027ve done your duty. You can report back to the Comte now; tell him I thank him for his concern, and that I look forward to seeing him again,\" she said with an ill-concealed smirk as she went up the marble steps.\n \"But he didn\u0027t-\" he objected, wanting to convince her that his company had been his idea, not an order from his employer; he received what might have been a blown kiss for his efforts.\n Text of a letter written in Greek from Ismail al-Rachad in Antioch, to Saint-Germain Ragoczy, Comte Franciscus at Chateau Ragoczy near Lake Geneva, Yvoire, Switzerland; carried by private courier.\n To the most highly regarded Comte Franciscus, the greetings of Ismail al-Rachad on this, the 2ndday of September, 1817, by the calendar of you Infidel dogs,\n I have received the gold you were good enough to send to me not two days since, and I have spent a third of it already, may Allah be praised for magnanimity. The cargos of your three ships held in harbor will be released and the ships permitted to set sail by the 10thof this month, which would not have been possible without the money you have provided. It is truly as you observed in your letter: gold and license keep close company. The sum I have paid-which I will not demean by calling it a bribe-has made me keenly aware of how readily the local authorities may be persuaded through indulgence. This was not unknown to me before, but it has been demonstrated with such stark clarity that I can only marvel at how openly these men abuse their offices.\n I am sorry to report that the Daystar has had an outbreak of fever among her crew, and before she can sail, a dozen sailors must be replaced. Through the mercy of Allah the lives of most of these men has been spared: there is a good physician here, and he has said that the crew has contracted inflamed livers from poor water. The water-barrels are all going to be replaced and those men too ill to sail will be taken into the physician\u0027s care until they are dead or sufficiently recovered to return to the sea. I am working with Captain Irkul to find men to sail with the ship on or before the 10th.\n I am doing my utmost to secure a safe passage to Egypt for the deMontalia woman. As she is of your blood, I am obligated to arrange such for her, but I must tell you that it is not very prudent to permit a young woman to travel alone in this part of the world. There are many dangers that threaten her, most of which I doubt she comprehends or is prepared to deal with. I trust you know what you are asking for her when you charge me with the duty of getting her the passage she seeks.\n There has been an improvement in shipping of late, and I am glad to say that your ships are sailing with full holds. For the next year, if all goes well, we should recoup a good portion of the losses of the last two years, if Allah wills it. If this continues to be the case, I will finally send for my family and set them up in a suitable house. I may even take a third wife. In five years, I will purchase a ship of my own and if Allah favors my endeavors, I will have my own shipping company before I am thirty-five. The men of my family are long-lived, so I have a good expectation of seeing fifty years. A man can accomplish a great deal in fifty years.\n I am grateful to you-dog of an Infidel though you are-for all the opportunities you have provided me, and I am certain that you will never have cause to regret the trust you have placed in me,\n Your most devoted servant\n Ismail al-Rachad\n factor, Eclipse Trading Company\n Antioch \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/borne-in-blood-saint-germain-20/page-11.html","bookId":2503,"book":{"id":2503,"title":"Borne in Blood (Saint-Germain #20)","description":"Storyline: \n Borne in Blood (Saint-Germain #20) \n The year is 1817.
