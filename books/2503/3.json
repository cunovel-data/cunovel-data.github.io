{"id":106732,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"A howling storm had kept them inside for two days, hovering near fireplaces, reading by wavering candlelight. Just now they were in the smaller of the two withdrawing rooms-the one on the sheltered south side of the chateau-the draperies over the six tall windows drawn to keep in the warmth. Hero huddled in front of the hearth on a large ottoman, a wolf-skin rug wrapped around her; Ragoczy sat on a low stool at her feet, his black coachman\u0027s cloak worn negligently over his shoulders, more as a concession to Hero than to keep out the chill, which hardly bothered him. There was a book in his hands, lit by the unsteady flames from a standing candelabra set behind his shoulder, and he turned the pages slowly, looking for another story to read. Although it was just past noon, the room was dark as twilight, with shadows clinging to the corners or the apartment augmenting the gloom.\\n\\n \"Do you really like ghost stories? or are you just indulging me?\" Hero asked; she spoke in Italian, her pronunciation northern. Under the wolf-skin rug, she wore sensible clothes-a woollen round dress with a high waist and a swallowtail riding jacket; her hair was braided and done in a coronet, all covered in a small cap edged in black, an indication of her widowhood; her hair and eyes were the same sunny shade of brown. She was thirty-two, the only surviving child of the great antiquarian scholar, Attilio Corvosaggio, and at present, alone in the world but for Saint-Germain Ragoczy, Comte Franciscus.\\n\\n \"I find them ... intriguing,\" said Ragoczy, his tone thoughtful. \"And just at present, they are in vogue.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, they are,\" she agreed, shivering in spite of the heavy fur cocoon she had made for herself. She pulled the wolf-skin rug higher so that her face was framed in the silvery fur; shifting her place on the ottoman, she leaned onto her elbow, offering him a smile that was achingly sad. \"Do you think it is because I still miss Fridhold? that I like ghost stories?\" Her question was wistful.\\n\\n \"I think you will miss your husband all your life, no matter what you choose to read,\" said Ragoczy gently. \"I believe you still grieve for him.\"\\n\\n \"But he has been dead nearly six years,\" she protested. \"Surely I should not mourn any longer. We were married not quite seven years.\"\\n\\n Ragoczy studied her for a long moment, then said, \"You mourn as long as you mourn. There is no set time on it.\"\\n\\n \"But it is a year of mourning, and then it is over,\" said Hero. \"I am well-beyond that time.\"\\n\\n \"There is no blame,\" said Ragoczy. \"And if ghost stories ease your grief and give you solace, who am I to deny them to you?\"\\n\\n She motioned to the book he held. \"What more would you like to read? Or would you prefer to stop for now?\"\\n\\n \"There is a story here by Hoffmann. You like Hoffmann, do you not?\" He knew the answer, but waited for her to decide.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" she said. \"But not the one about the Devil\u0027s Elixir, if you please. You read that to me last week, and it\u0027s too soon to hear it again.\"\\n\\n He rose and went to the small bookcase across from the hearth. \"Would you like something entirely new? I have a book of Spanish tales, if you would enjoy them? They\u0027re not quite like the ones we have been reading.\" He had collected half of them himself, not quite a century ago. \"The Catalonian stories are the most interesting of the lot, not the same flavor as most Spanish tales.\"\\n\\n \"Are they in Spanish?\" She stared into the fire, her expression astonishingly blank. \"I don\u0027t know Spanish.\"\\n\\n \"I will translate them for you, if you like,\" he offered, taking the book from the shelf. \"As you have translated Turkish for me.\" He spoke Turkish quite well, but found her skill engaging, and more in the modern style than the version he knew.\\n\\n She said nothing for a short while; the ticking of the grandmother clock by the door to the parlor provided an orderly counterpoint to the snap and rush of the flames. \"If you think I would like them, why not?\"\\n\\n He pulled the book from the shelf and began to thumb through the pages. \"Here\u0027s one: How Pedro Defeated the Night-Hag.\" He had a brief, intense recollection of Csimenae and her vampire clan, and wondered if she still haunted the eastern peaks of the Pyrenees; he had lost all but the most fleeting sense of her since she had disavowed their Blood Bond over five hundred years ago.\\n\\n \"Try it,\" said Hero, and leaned toward him as he returned to the stool and made himself comfortable. Before he began to read, she said, \"Do you think the roads will be passable next week?\"\\n\\n \"It depends on how long this storm lasts, and how much snow it drops. It is possible, but just now, not very promising.\" He took her hand without pulling her arm from the protection of the wolf-skin rug. \"You need not fret. There is food and firewood enough to last us three months, assuming a little hunting can be done between blizzards. Rogier often goes out for small game when the weather is clear, and Uchtred likes to fish.\"\\n\\n \"It is venison today, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"Yes; unless you would prefer something else,\" he said, aware of her discontent. \"Order what you like.\"\\n\\n She shook her head. \"It\u0027s not that. It\u0027s nothing to do with food,\" she said. \"I haven\u0027t had a letter from my father-in-law since the one in September, and I worry.\"\\n\\n He kissed her hand. \"As soon as he can, Rogier will go into Geneva and get the post. No doubt you will have news waiting. You remember how long it took for his winter letter to reach you last year, when the weather was worse.\" He prepared to open the book once more, when something struck him: \"I will say this for the Graf, much as I deplore his keeping you away from your children, he writes to you every quarter.\"\\n\\n \"It is very responsible of him. But I miss them. I haven\u0027t seen them in four years.\" She said this last quietly, as if expressing it more loudly would add to her loneliness. \"Do you think they are much changed?\"\\n\\n \"I think they are growing up, and that must change them,\" said Ragoczy as kindly as he could. \"But I suspect you would know them anywhere.\"\\n\\n \"I hope so,\" she said, touching his shoulder before pulling her hand back into the folds of the wolf-skin rug. \"Go on. You\u0027ve caught my interest, I confess it. How did Pedro defeat the Night-Hag?\"\\n\\n Ragoczy opened the book and commenced to read: the tale was a dark one, with the Night-Hag pursuing Pedro as he attempted to sleep; she sat on his chest, she rattled bones around his head, she summoned monsters to gibber and howl at him. He tried prayer, but his saints were indifferent to his plight. He summoned the priest, but the exorcism was ineffective. He tried sleeping by day and ploughing his fields by night, but the Night-Hag still bedeviled his attempts at rest. Finally, in desperation, he set fire to his cottage and nearly burned it to the ground, but the Night-Hag would not be routed. At his wits\u0027 end, Pedro begged the local prostitute to help him, and she agreed-for a price-to join with him in doing battle with the Night-Hag. And what a battle it was! The prostitute mounted Pedro\u0027s loins and leaned over his body so that the Night-Hag could find no purchase upon him, then Pedro and the prostitute bounced so heartily that the Night-Hag was dislodged from the bed, and when she keened, the prostitute shrieked more loudly. After a night of harrowing feats, the Night-Hag was beaten; she retreated and never tormented Pedro again. For the first time in months, Pedro slept soundly and awoke without dread. The prostitute continued to visit him, and to earn her pay, but never again would Pedro allow her to be on top of him, for he feared that would tempt the Night-Hag to another attack.\\n\\n For a minute or so after Ragoczy finished the story, Hero said nothing. Then she gave a shaky laugh and said, \"Not precisely a children\u0027s story, is it?\" Without waiting for him to respond, she went on, \"Still, the Greek legends of long ago are as carnal as this one, and everyone believes they are improving myths.\"\\n\\n \"It is a way to explain what is not understood,\" said Ragoczy, and set the book aside.\\n\\n \"It is a strange thing to me, that so often folktale explanations are much worse than the actual reasons are.\" She sighed. \"What is it in us that longs so for large disasters instead of small accidents and happenstance?\"\\n\\n \"Importance,\" said Ragoczy. \"Or so I have come to think-many men would prefer to be the object of malign destiny than one unfortunate enough to have ended up in harm\u0027s way for no more reason than that of inauspicious coincidence. An angry god after you lends you importance that accidents do not.\" He thought of the monks on Dhenoussa and the storm that brought him into their hands; his Egyptian steersman had believed that Poseidon had been the source of their ordeal, which was an act of vengeance for slighting his power, but Ragoczy had concluded at the time that contrary winds and high seas were the forces responsible.\\n\\n She shook her head. \"I can\u0027t imagine that anyone would seek to magnify misfortune in such a way,\" she said, then went on in a brisker tone, \"No, I don\u0027t mean that. I can understand, and I have seen it happen. But losses are hard enough to bear without burdening them with greater significance than they possess for themselves.\"\\n\\n He reached out and touched her cheek. \"As you have cause enough to know.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t intend to dwell on the past: it is fixed and cannot be changed.\" She shook her head twice.\\n\\n \"You may change your understanding of the past,\" he suggested gently.\\n\\n \"As you have done?\" she suggested remotely. \"But I haven\u0027t your centuries to provide perspective.\"\\n\\n \"Ah,\" he said, a bit ruefully.\\n\\n She contemplated the middle distance. \"The fire in my room is still burning. We will be warm there.\"\\n\\n \"Are you sure you want to retire so early in the day? It is barely one o\u0027clock.\" He glanced toward the clock. \"Dinner will be ready in an hour. It would be unkind to Uchtred not to eat it while it is hot.\"\\n\\n \"Surely we will be done in an hour? An hour?\" she ventured, rising and moving her wolf-skin rug so it was around her shoulders more securely. \"Not that I want to hurry you.\"\\n\\n \"It is you who should not be hurried,\" he reminded her.\\n\\n \"It is lovely of you to be so thoughtful,\" she said, going toward the double doors that would give the nearest access to stairs. \"For all you say you benefit from it.\"\\n\\n \"I assure you that I do,\" Ragoczy said, following her without haste yet with obvious pleasant anticipation.\\n\\n \"Think of how we might make the most out of the time we have together,\" she encouraged him as she opened the door and beckoned him to follow her.\\n\\n He closed the door and called out for Rogier. \"We will be upstairs for an hour or so. If you will keep the fires lit in the private dining room and the withdrawing room, I would appreciate it.\"\\n\\n Rogier, who stood in the doorway leading back to the kitchen, said, \"Very well, my master.\"\\n\\n \"If you have any questions, perhaps they could wait for an hour or so?\" Ragoczy suggested.\\n\\n \"An hour or so? Certainly. I doubt there is anything so pressing that it cannot wait until tomorrow, if necessary.\"\\n\\n \"Very good,\" said Ragoczy, and prepared to follow Hero up the curving stairs toward the narrow gallery above; at a signal from Rogier, he swung his cloak off his shoulders and handed it to his manservant as he began his ascent.\\n\\n Hero took the corridor on the west side of the gallery, following it along to the large bedchamber at its end. Like the rest of the nineteen-room chateau, its draperies and curtains were drawn and the metal fire-screen protected the fine Turkish carpet from stray sparks. A single candle protected by a glass chimney stood on the bedside table, providing enough illumination to make the room into a grotto, full of promise and secrets. As she threw the wolf-skin rug onto the foot of the bed, Hero shivered, and swung around to face Ragoczy. \"Tell me what you want.\"\\n\\n \"I ought to ask that of you,\" he said, as he went up to her and took her into his arms. \"You should not be cold.\" He glanced at the nearest window where the blizzard drummed icy fingers and whimpered.\\n\\n \"How could I be?\" She leaned her head on his shoulder. \"Outside is cold. In here, there is heat.\"\\n\\n \"Then we must make sure it stays that way.\" He touched her hair, loosening the three long ivory pins that held the coronet in place; the single, thick plait swung down her back. Slowly he kissed her forehead and closed eyelids, then put his attention on her shoulders, caressing them through the fabric of her jacket and shirt before unfastening the first of the three military-style frogs that kept it closed. He put a dozen little kisses along her brow and cheek; all the while, he listened to her breathing, to the sound of her pulse, matching his pace to her arousal. He reached over and pulled back the goose-down comforter, revealing the pristine linen sheets. \"Where is your robe?\"\\n\\n \"Inside the door of my closet,\" she whispered.\\n\\n He gently assisted her to be seated on the bed, gave her a long, soft, searching kiss, then went to fetch her robe. \"I would not wish you to be cold,\" he said, as he brought the long, heavy, quilted-silk garment to her. \"Let me help you with your jacket and your dress.\" He unfastened the stud holding her jabot and set it aside.\\n\\n She held out her arms to the sides, her palms turned up, her eyes slightly averted. \"Thank you,\" she said softly.\\n\\n Skillfully, unhurriedly, he eased her out of the jacket, setting it on the dresser between the closet and the bed; next he unfastened the lacing at the back of the high bodice of her round-dress; he worked the shoulders down her arms and was left with the camisole to unbutton. \"If you will stand, I\u0027ll remove the dress and shirt now.\"\\n\\n Before she did, she touched his face, still not looking directly at him. She quivered at his touch as he unfastened the buttons. Clad only in her undergarments she accepted her robe without any hesitation, snuggling into its deep folds with every sign of relief. \"I don\u0027t want you to be cold,\" she said, leaning back onto the exposed sheets. \"Come lie next to me. Here. You\u0027ll be warm.\"\\n\\n \"I will, but not for fear of cold,\" he said, kneeling beside the bed in order to slide the robe open so that he could reach her garters and lower her stockings before removing her kid-skin house-shoes.\\n\\n \"You have the most wonderful touch,\" she murmured as his hands moved deliciously over her legs. Although it was cold, she didn\u0027t mind it; his attentions more than made up for the momentary chill.\\n\\n \"And you have the most wonderful skin,\" he countered, as he dropped her shoes to the floor, and then finished sliding off her stockings. He bent and kissed the arches of her feet, then moved up onto the bed and resumed his task of loosening her stays, allowing himself to be enveloped in the folds of her robe as he did.\\n\\n She sighed, contentment and regret in the sound. \"I wish I could ...\" Words faded as she felt his small hands on her breasts. She reached languorously to embrace him, her eyes dreamy, her breathing slow and deep. This was what she needed, she realized, and returned his kisses with her own, feeling her ardor stir and commence to unfurl within her flesh. \"Oh, yes. Do that again.\"\\n\\n He complied, taking longer than usual in order to intensify her sensations. When her nipples swelled against his palms, he leaned down and used his lips instead of his fingers to excite her. \"Tell me what you like,\" he said softly.\\n\\n \"You know what I like,\" she said, holding him less tightly in order to give him more access to her body. \"Don\u0027t make me choose, just do what you know I like.\"\\n\\n He hesitated a brief moment, then whispered, \"If anything displeases you, tell me.\"\\n\\n \"You have never displeased me, not in bed.\" She ran her fingers through the short, loose waves of his dark hair. \"Not once.\"\\n\\n He fingered the top of her hip, tracing the line of her body along her abdomen toward the deep folds between her legs. He parted the delicate tissues and sought out the small, hidden bud that responded to every nuance of passion. Many of the women he had known over the centuries had taken great pleasure in having that knot worked with his tongue, but Hero did not; she preferred what his fingers could do, so he continued to nuzzle her breasts while his hand awakened her desire to a state of rapture. She hovered on the brink of release while he moved to her neck. Now her breath quickened and shivers of ecstasy ran through her; she sank her fingers into his hair. As the first paroxysm surged through her, she let out three soft cries, gathering him close to her and rocking him through the throes of her fulfillment. She continued to enfold him as her excitement waned, as if their embrace would prolong and enhance her gratification.\\n\\n The bracket-clock sounded the three-quarter hour as they finally rolled apart. Hero looked over at the clock and scowled. \"We probably shouldn\u0027t linger. I can smell the venison already.\"\\n\\n He uttered a single chuckle. \"The meal will be on the table in another fifteen minutes,\" he said as he started to sit up.\\n\\n She poked him in his side. \"You don\u0027t have to get dressed. I depend on you to help me.\"\\n\\n \"Certainly,\" he said promptly. \"You have only to tell me what you require,\" he said as he rose to his feet and held out his hand to assist her.\\n\\n She slipped her hand into his. \"I\u0027ll want my Polish velvet walking-dress for this afternoon, the raspberry-colored one, with the standing collar.\"\\n\\n \"Very good,\" said Ragoczy, opening her closet door and selecting the garment in question; this he laid on the bed, close at hand. \"For a chamise?\"\\n\\n \"The Italian silk,\" she said. \"It\u0027s ivory, with lace on the neck-bands.\" She held her robe closed while she bent over to retrieve her stockings and shoes. \"It\u0027s warmer than what I was wearing this morning.\"\\n\\n \"Then by all means,\" he said, \"choose something that will keep you warm.\" He waited while she pulled on her stockings and garters, and stepped into her shoes, then found her corset where he had dropped it; he came back to her, reached under her robe and prepared to lace up the back of the corset. \"Will you want to wear an under-shift as well, or is this satisfactory?\"\\n\\n \"You do make an admirable ladies\u0027 maid,\" said Hero, enjoying the last flicker of her fading tantalization conveyed in his touch. \"Not that I expect a ladies\u0027 maid to attend to me so completely.\"\\n\\n He kissed her as he aligned her corset, then began to tighten the lacings, working them carefully so the corset would not bind. \"Just as well, given Wendela\u0027s temperament. It pleases me to serve you,\" he said with a slow smile before he kissed her, still continuing his efforts on her corset.\\n\\n When their kiss broke, she was a little breathless. \"If only dinner wasn\u0027t ready,\" she said with a trace of regret. \"Although you have already-\"\\n\\n \"Been nourished?\" he suggested when she stopped speaking.\\n\\n \"I suppose you could say that,\" she told him quietly. \"Yes, I want an under-shift. I should have put one on this morning; I wouldn\u0027t have needed the wolf-skin rug if I had.\"\\n\\n \"But the wolf-skin rug becomes you,\" said Ragoczy gently.\\n\\n \"Do you think so?\" She reached out and laid her finger against his lips. \"Don\u0027t talk about this, will you?\"\\n\\n \"No; I never would.\" He finished tying her laces and stepped back. \"In which drawer to you keep your under-shifts?\"\\n\\n \"The second from the top, on the left.\" She closed her robe.\\n\\n \"The one with the blue embroidery, if you please.\"\\n\\n \"It will be my pleasure.\" He slid the drawer open and removed the under-shift she sought; it was soft, made of fine knitted goat-hair yarn and silken decoration. He held it out to her. \"If you want to slip into it?\"\\n\\n She nodded again, and pulled off her robe, flinging it onto the bed before she could change her mind. She tugged the under-shift down from her shoulders and looked for her chamise. \"The fire isn\u0027t making much headway,\" she said as her teeth chattered.\\n\\n \"I will make sure it is built up for tonight, from the furnace next to the kitchen, not on this hearth.\" He handed her the chamise.\\n\\n \"Doesn\u0027t that worry you? Mightn\u0027t the chimney catch fire?\" She shivered again, this time from fear.\\n\\n \"The flues are constructed along Roman lines, and they do double duty, as chimneys and as comprehensive heaters. They are better ventilated, and have six shielded channels up through the walls that meet at two chimneys on the roof, as the old Roman household holocaust did in the floors, and the hotter-burning hypocausts did in the walls and floors in the baths. These channels are more like a hypocaust than a holocaust.\" Over the centuries he had tried many variations on the Roman design when he had the opportunity to adapt his dwellings to his standards. This chateau had been no exception, being partially ruined when he bought it, and providing him with an opportunity to include Roman engineering as part of his own uses.\\n\\n \"I suppose you got your idea from them?\" She reached for her shirt and pulled it on, fastening its eighteen pearl buttons with unseemly haste; she felt something beyond cold now-a loneliness that touched her to the marrow.\\n\\n \"To a large degree, yes. Some I learned from the Russians, more than two hundred years ago.\" He offered the body of the gown to her.\\n\\n Hero pulled the garment over her head, wriggling to get it settled in place. \"If you will tend to my laces?\"\\n\\n \"Of course,\" said Ragoczy, and moved around behind her. \"Stand still and I\u0027ll finish this in a minute.\"\\n\\n Hero lifted her heavy plait of hair and said, \"Why is fashion so complicated? Not that the Parisians or Romans would call this fashion.\"\\n\\n \"It is complicated so that you can show that you can afford a chambermaid or a \u0027tire woman to dress you. And neither Rome nor Paris has the winters Yvoire does, even in mild years.\" He slipped the knots into the back of her gown, then reached for the long, broad-skirted jacket with the standing collar and eased this onto her arms and settled it on her shoulders. \"There. I hope I\u0027ve done the task correctly. So long as Wendela is recovering from her putrid lungs, I am willing to do my poor best for you.\"\\n\\n \"Your poor best is more than satisfactory,\" said Hero and turned to kiss his cheek. \"It is inconvenient that she should be ill, and it is most kind of you to offer to treat her.\"\\n\\n \"Her family did not think so,\" he said with a wry smile.\\n\\n \"Then her family should-\"\\n\\n \"It is their decision and we do well to honor it,\" he said. \"And it is not as if you haven\u0027t managed without a maid before. I know your father did not provide you one when you went with him to Anatolia.\"\\n\\n \"No, but there was Madama Chiaro, and we traded maid duties with one another.\" She chuckled. \"It meant more than tying laces-it meant looking for scorpions in our shoes and cases, and trying to keep the sand from ruining our clothes. I must have destroyed four muslin dresses before I learned how to care for them properly. You know Anatolia. You know what it\u0027s like. And you know Egypt.\"\\n\\n He had a short, sharp recollection of his long centuries at the Temple of Imhotep; he said, \"Not from the point of view of modern women\u0027s clothing.\"\\n\\n \"You must tell me about it, one day,\" she said, carefully putting hooks through eyes in the front of her jacket. \"I hate to think what would have become of me if Madame de Montalia had not sent her recommendation to you.\"\\n\\n \"And entrusted her manuscript to you for delivery,\" added Ragoczy. \"I, too, am thankful to her.\"\\n\\n \"Sometimes I fear I have done her an ill turn.\"\\n\\n \"You have not,\" he said.\\n\\n \"I hope that\u0027s so,\" she said, then made a final adjustment to her collar. \"There. I believe I am ready.\"\\n\\n \"And so, I presume, is your dinner,\" he said, offering her his arm.\\n\\n \"Before Uchtred becomes annoyed, permit me to take you down to the smaller dining room.\"\\n\\n \"And wish me bon appetite?\" she ventured with a lift of her brows.\\n\\n He opened the bedroom door and bowed her out. \"Of course, dear lady: bon appetite.\"\\n\\n Text of a letter from Klasse van der Boom in Amsterdam, to Saint-Germain Ragoczy, Comte Franciscus at Chateau Ragoczy near Lake Geneva, Yvoire, Switzerland; delivery delayed five weeks on account of severe weather.\\n\\n To the most Excellent Saint-Germain Ragoczy, Comte Franciscus, the greeting of Klasse van der Boom, printer and publisher, Eclipse Press, in Amsterdam, on this, the eleventh day of March, 1817.\\n\\n My dear Comte,\\n\\n As you no doubt realize, I am sending you copies of our latest editions, as per the terms of our agreement of nine years ago.\\n\\n I think you will find that the diCaponieve has the best illustrations, and may prove the most rewarding of the six books in this package. Certainly for those traveling through the Alps, diCaponieve\u0027s guide to roads, villages and towns, monasteries, inns, spas, hotels, and hostelries should prove invaluable. I have taken the step of ordering two thousand copies in Italian for the initial printing, and an additional eight hundred in French-an unusually high number, I realize, but one I believe will prove to be well-founded. I have approached many hoteliers along the routes diCaponieve describes, in the hope that the work will find readers with an immediate need of it.\\n\\n Kreutzerlinder\u0027s book on the history of the Crusades through the exploration of ruins in the Ottoman Empire may not find as wide an audience, but anticipating an interest from universities, I have ordered twelve hundred copies of it. The illustrations in the volume are not as well-done as those in diCaponieve\u0027s book, lacking in the fine detail and artistic presentation of the guide-book. But the text is informative and presented with concision, and will doubtless provoke lively discussion, given Kreutzerlinder\u0027s theories on the role of the Byzantines in the conflict. I will be certain to approach German booksellers, to take advantage of the language in which it is written.\\n\\n Juencleu\u0027s book on the French in Canada is not likely to find as broad a readership as either the Kreutzerlinder or the diCaponieve, and so I have ordered nine hundred copies of it, and will send letters to booksellers in Montreal in the hope that they will want to supply the work of one of their own to their clientele. I must confess I still have doubts about it, but I will, of course, abide by your instructions regarding its publication. It may be as you say, that the New World may eventually become as important as the Old.\\n\\n Donsky\u0027s book on game- and song-birds of Russia is handsome, but I agree it is not a subject of avid interest here in western Europe. Fortunately there are many illustrations and all but two turned out well, a feature that could interest more readers than the topic can be expected to attract. At least it is in French and not Russian, for which I am grateful.\\n\\n The deMontalia text on Rhodes and Cyprus will also have a first edition of twelve hundred copies, with nine pages of illustrations to increase its attractions. I have come to think that you are correct in your assumption that because of Napoleon\u0027s expedition to Egypt almost twenty years ago, many in Europe have become fascinated with antiquities, and works of this kind may find a continuing intellectual appetite for such works, especially as it is in French and should enjoy a vogue in Paris.\\n\\n I trust I will not offend you when I say that I have only ordered one thousand copies of your Legends and Folk-Tales from the Carpathians. I have put the name of G. Tsarogy on it, as you have stipulated. I will see that it is offered in Vienna as well as Paris and Rome, for all it is in French; the Austrians have good reason to familiarize themselves with the traditions in the Carpathians. This should complement the book by G. Tsarogy on the Byzantine Empire that sold so many copies in the last three years; at least that is the way in which I will present it to booksellers.\\n\\n Now as to those solicitations for publication that you may wish to consider as part of the program for next year: Captain Rupert Burchell of the Royal Navy has submitted a work on improved navigational devices; his style is pedantic but his concepts are intriguing; he writes in English. Ermingard Frement of Trier has sent a guide to the Roman ruins in that city; her work is in French. Casimir Skolodi offered a manuscript in Polish on farming techniques to reduce crop losses due to harsh weather; I have translated a sizable portion of the work into German and asked my Friesian cousin to evaluate what Skolodi recommends and will relay his evaluation to you. Wallache Sieffert, Graf von Ravensberg, an Austrian, has submitted a work in German on the properties of the blood based on his experiments; it is a thorough work, with a great deal of information. Morgan Belclair has submitted a long manuscript in English on weather variations in western Europe and England for the past century; it is more informative than the Skolodi book, but less practical in its application. Professore Bonaldo Certi has submitted a work in Italian on the trade-routes of the Romans and the role they played in establishing ports still actively trading; I have shown this to Jules Forcier for his analysis, which is included in this parcel. I should mention that submissions are up by twenty percent over last year, and we are having to reject six for every one we actually consider.\\n\\n I remined you we have five books already scheduled for next year and to include more than one or two of these would require an expansion of the program. I am more than willing to undertake a more comprehensive program, providing certain adjustments are made in the actual press and bindery here in Amsterdam. Such improvements would increase our production, but would require a further investment in equipment and materiel, which figures I include for your consideration. If you decide on expansion, I will need to employ another pressman and at least two more typesetters; the sooner I have your determination, the sooner I can begin our work.\\n\\n With my assurances of my continued dedication to our shared endeavors\\n\\n I remain\\n\\n Yours to command,\\n\\n Klasse van der Boom\\n\\n printer and publisher\\n\\n Eclipse Press\\n\\n Amsterdam \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/borne-in-blood-saint-germain-20/page-3.html","bookId":2503,"book":{"id":2503,"title":"Borne in Blood (Saint-Germain #20)","description":"Storyline: Borne in Blood (Saint-Germain #20) \\n The year is 1817. In Switzerland, the Count Saint-Germain leads a comfortable life with his paramour Hero whose husband died fighting Napoleon. Saint-Germain\u0027s loving kindness cannot keep Hero from missing her children who are being raised by their hard-hearted grandfather. \\n The Count has become intrigued by the work of an Austrian noble investigating the properties of blood, a subject always of key interest to a vampire. But when the noble\u0027s beautiful ward fixates sexually on the Count, the vampire fears for himself and his gentle lover. \\n With Borne in Blood, Chelsea Quinn Yarbro\u0027s saga of Count Saint-Germain, reaches a milestone--the twentieth volume of the vampire\u0027s adventures.
