I smiled to myself and leaned back into his ripped body. “Where’s my little man?” His lips ghosted along my shoulder as he spoke.\\n\\n “Your sister took him upstairs for a nap.” Haven had been spending as much time as she could between school and work visiting, just to spoil her nephew.\\n\\n “She’s still here?” he asked with a laugh. I nodded and turned around to wrap my arms around him. My stomach sunk and Trip’s entire body went solid as a rock under my hands.\\n\\n “What the mother fuck?” he boomed, his eyes shooting from the baby monitor to the ceiling and then back to the small white speaker again.\\n\\n “We can’t do this here, sweetheart.” Jude’s voice was clearly amplified through the room.\\n\\n “Bathroom. I need you. I need you so badly, Jude.” Trip’s face was now a picture of rage as he glared at the baby monitor.\\n\\n “Your brothers are downstairs and—fuck. Don’t do that.” Jude’s groan echoed through the painfully silent room.\\n\\n “Fuck. No,” Mace growled through gritted teeth looking like his head was about to explode. I gripped Trip’s arm to no avail; he all but sprinted out of the room and up the stairs, Mace already two steps ahead of him.\\n\\n “Sweet baby Jesus, here we go,” Scar stated echoing my thoughts exactly. We shot each other a pained look and took off after the boys.\\n\\n “If they break my house, I’m going to break them,” I grumbled stomping up the steps toward what promised to be World War Three. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/conflicted-love-needle-s-kiss-2/page-24.html","bookId":1955,"book":{"id":1955,"title":"Conflicted Love (Needle\u0027s Kiss #2)","description":"Storyline: Conflicted Love (Needle\u0027s Kiss #2) \\n Trip’s life motto is simple: get in, get off, get out.
