She didn’t need to say a thing. Her eyes were begging. Begging for me to take her. Begging for me to not make this a big deal. Begging for me to not make her beg. Shit. Make her beg? Fuck that. I might never get an opportunity like this one again. I wasn’t stupid enough to let a horny Teeny go to bed and finish herself off. After all, I was really just taking care of my baby momma. It was my duty. Or at least, that’s what I told myself. My breathing picked up coming in short fast bursts. I reached lower on her back until my hands cupped her firm ass. I squeezed the perfect globes and lowered my face to hers. The way she lifted her head to mine showed me just how much she needed this, and I’d be damned if I denied her anything. Our lips are a hair’s breadth away from each other’s, I ran my nose along hers and took in the soft sigh she let out. I whispered, “Let me take care of you.” She didn’t respond. Not with words, anyway. Her lips parted and she licked my top lip. My eyes closed and I took in the sweet taste of her tongue. Fuck me. She was perfect. My hands at her ass, I rubbed her back once again before my hand came forward, slid down her belly and lowered to the heat between her thighs. As soon as my fingertips brushed her pussy, she pressed her lips to mine with a long low moan. She was killing me. What had started off slow and wary, quickly turned into something else entirely. Within minutes, I had Teeny straddling my lap, her panties pulled off to the side and my fingers flicking her clit as she ground against my hard-on. Our breathing in sync, heavy and labored as her chest moved up and down, I freed one perky swollen tit from her lacey pink bra. I leaned in and flicked my tongue against her hardened nipple pulling the silver ring between my lips and giving it a little tug. A gasp escaped her lips at the same time as I moaned against her skin. The friction of her grinding on me was bringing me dangerously close to embarrassing myself. I had to think fast, problem was with Teeny letting loose like she was, I wasn’t thinking much beyond getting my end in as soon as fucking possible. Thinking quickly, I grabbed her hips and flipped her onto her back while tearing her panties clean off. Her squeak of surprise turned into a gasp when I dropped my mouth down into her hot sex and began eating her like a starving man. Flicking my tongue ring against her clit, I proceeded to lick long and slow, from top to bottom. “Ohh, God, yes,” she cried out gripping the back of my head and holding me against her heat. “More, I need more,” she keened. She was so wet I had no problems slipping two fingers in. Her back arched and she cried out, her muscles clamping down on my hand. My jeans were now that tight I was pretty sure I’d forever have zipper imprints. I pulled my fingers out and back in again, making sure to hit that sweet spot every single time. Teeny’s legs started closing as her muscles locked up; she came so hard her arousal was running down my hand. Not able to wait any longer I pulled at my belt and ripped my jeans down. It suddenly occurred to me I didn’t have any condoms with me. “Wait, I don’t—shit. I don’t have anything on me, Princess”. “Does it matter anymore? Just put it in already” she snapped, her chest rising and falling fast. She had a point. It didn’t, but at the same time it did. “I’m safe, I mean. There hasn’t been anyone since…I’m safe,” I rambled. “I know. Now shut up and fuck me!” she yelled. Well, clear and straight to the point, I didn’t hold back. I moved over the top of her and slid home with a growl. Heaven. That was the only word to describe it. I ground against her trying my hardest not to pull back and pound her sweet pussy into oblivion. “Trip, please,” she moaned against my shoulder grinding her own hips into mine. The silver bar in the end of my dick was not only sending me into a spiral of tingling and ball clenching stupidity; it was rubbing against all the right spots to bring her right back to the edge. I fucking loved having my junk pierced at that moment. “Shit, baby. I’m gonna be fast. Tell me how you want it,” I groaned shifting slightly so I was all the way in and pressed tight to her body. “Brutal.” She bit down on my shoulder and murmured, “Fuck me hard, Trip. Please, I need you to fuck me hard. Make me scream.” Her words had my balls drawing up. The animal in me broke its shackles and let loose. With a roar, I pulled back and pounded into her at an unforgiving pace. Our hips smashing together, the slap of skin and heavy noises of our pleasure were all that filled the room. “I’m gonna come, Princess,” I ground out trying to hold back just a bit longer. I pulled her nipple into my mouth and sucked hard; she arched up under me and screamed, “Fuckkk, Oh God. God. Fuck,” as she clamped down on my painfully hard shaft setting me off into bliss with a roar of her name. Shaking, I pulled back leaning my weight on my forearms. Teeny lay under me looking limp and completely satisfied; her pussy still contracting around me every few seconds. Wondering how long it would be before she freaked out on me, I simply stayed put peppering small wet kisses down her neck to her perfect tits and back up again. Something occurred to me once I’d finished showing my appreciation for said perfect tits. “You know, they have to come out soon?” I asked flicking my tongue against the metal in her nipple. “What?” she replied on a small moan sounding distracted. “The rings. They have to come out soon. You want me to do that for you?” I was all for playing with her boobs. The fact they were bigger than when I had pierced them wasn’t lost on me. Thinking back to that day had me smiling with satisfaction. Teeny had come in to the parlor to have them done. I hadn’t wanted to do it. Just the thought of her exposing her goods in the back room of the shop had me rock hard. Scar had given me shit about Teeny, and at the time, I had known it was a bad idea. But once she’d stripped thinking she had one up on me when I’d blushed…needless to say I’d firmly put her in her place. “Quit playin’ with me, Princess,” I warned her. Her answering smirk told me I was warning her in vain. “Oh, I’d love to play with you, Trip. I hear you know how to take a girl on the ride of her life.” Reaching forward she brushed her tiny hand over the prominent bulge in the front of my pants. Moving fast, I kissed her hard leaving her stunned silent. I took advantage pushing my hand down the front of her jeans, flicking, tweaking and sliding my fingers into her amazingly tight pussy. I’d made her come hard while I pierced those pretty pink buds. She’d been blushing like a schoolgirl once we were done, and one thing was for sure, never had I looked at that table the same. Every time I walked into the piercing room, all I saw was Teeny and the way she had fallen apart at my hands and whispers of all the dirty things I could do to her. Afterward, she’d gotten dressed and made a hasty exit while I walked around for the rest of the day with blue balls and a smile as big as my boner had been. “Mmm if you keep that going, you can do whatever you like.” My still semi-hard dick jumped at the sound of her husky voice and just-fucked expression. “You’ll have to stop grinding your hips if you want me to take ‘em out, baby. I can’t concentrate when you do that.” On top of grinding, she started to breathe heavily again. Her hooded eyes made contact with mine. She smirked and clenched around me taking me from half-mast to full-sail all over again. Chapter Six Teeny Opening my eyes, I took in my surroundings; a very warm very hard body was pressed to my back, his hand wrapped around me cupping my deliciously sore lady bits. Last night hadn’t been planned, but the moment he touched me, my entire body lit up. Damn freaking hormones were wreaking havoc on me. One minute I was crying about pickles, the next I was begging to be stuffed with one. Speaking of pickles, I needed some; I hadn’t managed to get my fill. I was torn between shifting my hips onto the one poking me in the back, or the jar Trip had shoved in the fridge after screwing me senseless on the kitchen floor. Warm breath on my neck sent goose bumps across my naked flesh. Trip’s fingers twitched against me causing a small moan to escape my lips. I’d spent weeks fighting off his sweet talk and bullshit gestures, but maybe, just maybe, he could be good. If nothing else, I would get amazing sex from it. Hope poked its ugly head out and looked around the room smiling at me with its beady little eyes. “Mornin’, Princess.” Trip’s husky morning voice shot a bolt of pleasure straight to my crotch as he slipped a finger inside me and left tiny wet kisses along the back of my neck. Then it happened, my morning reminder. Ripping the sheet back, I jumped from the bed and bolted for the bathroom making it just in time to lose last night’s midnight snack. “Shit,” I heard mumbled behind me as I continued to dry heave. My hair was pulled up into a holder and the tap behind me was turned on before a wet washcloth was draped over my neck. “Go-way,” I grumbled between gags. I was more than a little mortified that he was in the bathroom while I sat naked on the floor and retching. “This happen often?” he asked in a gruff voice while loading up my toothbrush. “Yes,” I reluctantly admitted, “every morning and most nights.” My stomach rolled again but didn’t bring anything up this time. Without another word, Trip handed my toothbrush over and helped me up off the floor. With an odd, pensive look on his face, he turned on the shower and left the barely big enough room. He shut the door hard enough that the flimsy beat-up vanity rattled. I stepped into the tiny shower and attempted to let the water wash away the stress and embarrassment that weighed down my shoulders. I didn’t want anybody to see me weak, let alone Trip, yet that was exactly how I was feeling. I needed to be the strong girl I usually was. Not only had I called him while crying, I’d then gone and thrown myself at him like a nymphomaniac. Stepping out of the shower, I rationalized my situation. I had to be clear with him; this wasn’t going anywhere and it never would. We would share a child and that alone would give us a kind of bond, but that’s where it would stay. No more of this weak, helpless teary crap, I was turning into a hot and cold bitch and it was getting on my nerves. Wrapping a towel around myself, I decided it was time to call a truce with Trip. He might be a cocky ass and a notorious ladies’ man, but he was trying to be helpful and responsible, even if it was just for the baby and most likely wouldn’t last. I needed to pull up my big-girl panties and meet him halfway. My steps faltered when I caught a glimpse of Trip leaning his backside against the kitchen counter, legs stretched out, ankles crossed, barefoot and a pair of black jeans slung low on his hips. It took a moment to realize he didn’t look too happy. I didn’t quite understand why; I hadn’t done anything to piss him off yet. Unless, it was the fact he hadn’t gotten morning glory on account of my stomach. I could feel the anger radiating off him. His usually bright blue eyes were a stormy grey. I took a tiny step back when he moved his arms up and crossed them over his naked chest. I’d only seen him this mad once before; the moment he’d learned I was pregnant.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/conflicted-love-needle-s-kiss-2/page-7.html","bookId":1955,"book":{"id":1955,"title":"Conflicted Love (Needle\u0027s Kiss #2)","description":"Storyline: Conflicted Love (Needle\u0027s Kiss #2) Trip’s life motto is simple: get in, get off, get out.
