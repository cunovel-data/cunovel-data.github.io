{"id":68902,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"“Javerio,” she cried out, her back arching off the ground. That did it for me. I couldn’t hold back any longer.\\n\\n A primal growl ripped from my throat and I pumped my cock harder and faster. Flicking my wrist, I let loose and I came all over her pussy and tits leaving her completely unaware that I’d just done the unthinkable and marked my territory.\\n\\n Marked what was mine.\\n\\n I had a feeling if she knew why I’d done that, she’d be pissed way the fuck off. In fact, I don’t think she even realized she had called me by my real name. And if she did, she was playing the ignorant card.\\n\\n “Drunk sex fucking rocks,” she panted heavily and closed her eyes looking worn out and totally content covered in my cum. Nope. She didn’t realize, but I heard her and was not in a hurry to forget.\\n\\n Chapter Eleven\\n\\n Teeny\\n\\n “Hold the fuck still before you lose an eye,” I snapped at Scar. She’d been squirming for the last ten minutes while I put her makeup on.\\n\\n “‘Fuck up, bitch! I’m nervous alright. What if I fall ass over tit and break my neck?” she rushed out fidgeting with her lace cami top.\\n\\n “Are you shittin’ me?” I laughed. “You? The fearless Scarlett, nervous?”\\n\\n In perfect Scar form, she flipped me the bird and smiled, “Shut up and pass me my beer, please.”\\n\\n “Here. Now, hold still. If I don’t get this stuff done, you’ll never get out there and Mace’ll think you stood him up.” I passed her drink and moved on to her hair.\\n\\n We’d spent months making sure everything about this day was perfect and it was finally time. I was about to watch my very best friend get married to the man of her wet dreams. In all seriousness, I’d never seen two people more made for each other than they were. They challenged each other daily, but behind all the macho and tough exterior, they had found what we were all truly looking for. They’d found their special somebody.\\n\\n With Scarlett’s dad been gone for a few years, she’d decided to walk herself to her future husband. The wedding party was small just me as the maid of honor and Trip as the best man; this was something I wasn’t looking forward to. In my stupid ‘protect my heart’ moment, I’d encouraged him to bring a date. Stupid, right? Something told me this was about to backfire on my ass in a big way.\\n\\n It may have been the blonde bimbo I saw arriving in the too tight black dress. Who the hell wears a black dress to a wedding anyway? You wear black to a funeral not a wedding. I told myself my nit picking had nothing to do with the fact that she was here with Trip. My Trip.\\n\\n “Ready to get this dress on?” I asked after zipping my own floor-length strapless one, my belly poking out in front. Scarlett had offered to move the wedding date until after the baby was born. We argued about it for two days until I laid it out for her. If she got married while I was pregnant, baby midget would be in her bridal party too. Yes, the nickname had caught on, and yes, that reasoning was enough for Scarlett to carry on with her original wedding date.\\n\\n “Ready as I’ll ever be,” she mumbled sounding anxious.\\n\\n “Who ever thought you’d be saying that?” I whispered giving her a peck on the cheek.\\n\\n “Not me, that’s for sure,” Scarlett breathed out shakily.\\n\\n “Don’t cry. You’ll ruin the masterpiece I created,” I told her when I turned back around noticing her shining eyes.\\n\\n Shaking her head, she held my hand and squeezed tightly. She quickly put on a brave face and perked up. “Here, I’ll do it. Your fat ass can’t bend properly.”\\n\\n Poking my tongue out like a true lady, I slipped my white satin pumps onto my feet and steeled my own nerves.\\n\\n “Oh, shit,” I jaggedly whispered when I took her in. Swallowing past the sudden lump in my throat, I croaked, “Now, I’m going to cry.” I breathily added, “You look stunning, honey.”\\n\\n She would never know just how much I meant what I was saying. She looked like an angel; glowing beautifully beyond belief and most importantly, happy.\\n\\n “You cry, then I’ll cry, then we’ll both be a hot mess, and we’ll have to go out there looking like pair of raccoons that were sifting through garbage!” Scarlett told me smoothing out the front of her gorgeous wedding gown. A delicate shade of ivory fitted to her stunning curves. The bottom layer of satin was topped with an intricate lace that included a beautiful diamond baring the silken skin of her back showing off her tattoos.\\n\\n Tattoos that were part of her. Tattoos she was proud to show.\\n\\n “Turn around,” I whispered through the thickness in my throat. She turned and the view was no less amazing from the back of the gown. A fishtail train finished with more intricate lace and scalloped edging. Swarovski crystals were delicately sprinkled throughout with rich decorative beading at the empire waist.\\n\\n In short, the dress was stunning. But I think it was Scarlett and the way she was glowing that made it even more so.\\n\\n “You can do this. You’ll be fine. Just walk to the end of the aisle and stand there,” I rushed on a quick breath.\\n\\n “Yeah, I’m pretty sure I know how to do this bit, Teen,” Scar smiled and took her bouquet of black and white roses from my hand.\\n\\n “I wasn’t talking to you. I mean, I’m—just never mind let’s do this.” I turned, took a deep breath and waited for the double doors to open and the music to start.\\n\\n “You know, I remember this really smart bitch telling me to pull my head outta my ass and get with the motherfucking program. Might be time for her to take a little of her own advice,” Scarlett finished in soft voice just as the music started up and the doors swung open.\\n\\n “I’m not sure he’s anybody’s knight in shining armor though,” I whispered to myself remembering the day I’d told Scarlett those words.\\n\\n Taking slow practiced steps, I managed to get halfway down the aisle before looking Trip’s way. My breath caught in my chest, my heart beating hard against my ribs. He stood beside Mace hands clasped in front of him complete in a black suit with a white shirt unbuttoned at the top, a tiny piece of his ink peeking out from underneath. His eyes trained on me as I tried not to fumble. Chewing on his lip piercings, he smirked. The idiot was so full of himself. I’d have bet he knew exactly how good he looked.\\n\\n Ten more steps. Just ten more steps.\\n\\n There was only one perfect song for Scar to walk down the aisle to. It was a no-brainer. Mace and Scarlett had their first real run in with the words of Daughtry playing in the background. Mace stood at the front of the room looking so handsome in his suit waiting for his girl. “I Know There’s No Life After You” played. The music kicked up a notch, and gasps sounded from across the room as Scarlett stepped into sight. Tears pricked at my eyes watching my best friend walk down the aisle toward Mace who was watching her like she was the only thing in the world. The love that burst from those two was something everyone surely hoped to find someday.\\n\\n My heart constricted in my chest at their love. God, how I wanted that, but I was shit scared of it at the same time.\\n\\n Four steps to go, my eyes were drawn once more to Trip’s. His gaze was unwavering, and his smirk slipped when I saw something else flicker in his eyes. Holy fuck. I had no idea what that look was, but it sent a flutter of longing through my belly and straight to my lady bits. I tried desperately to pull away from his stare as I edged closer, but for the life of me, my traitorous body just wouldn’t behave. I needed to remember he was here with somebody else.\\n\\n Before I knew it, I was standing to the side of the altar eyes still fixed on Trip. His gaze didn’t waver. A flash of white filled my peripheral vision as Scar finally reached Mace.\\n\\n Thank fuck! I was able to drag my eyes away from Trip to focus once more on the bride and groom. They looked amazing together. Scar’s art on full display looking sexy as hell, teamed with her rocking dress and bright red heels. Mace looked down at her with such unabashed love that there was no holding back the small tear that trickled down my cheek.\\n\\n Shit. Do not cry. Do not cry!\\n\\n I swiped at my eyes with the back of my hand, pretending to be scratching an itch. If worse came to worst, I could always claim Trip’s date had sneezed on me and given me something contagious. Blood sucking troll. I resisted the urge to check and see if Trip was looking at me.\\n\\n The celebrant stepped forward and proceeded to start the ceremony, all eyes still on Mace and Scarlett; they were absolutely breathtaking together.\\n\\n I changed my focus from Scar to Mace and bit down on my tongue to stop myself from sobbing. Is that a tear clinging to the corner of his eye? He was trying to hold it back, doing that sniffling thing that men always do when they want to pretend they\u0027re not capable of shedding tears. But there it was, falling down his cheek like a shooting star. I swear, the lights reflected right off that beauty and flashed its presence to the entire world. That one single tear just solidified how much he really did love my best friend. And I knew with my whole heart, she had just transformed from my Scar to Mace’s Scarlett. It was bittersweet and everything I secretly dreamed of.\\n\\n “I do.” Scarlett’s words pulled me back to the moment. Smiling through the tears in my eyes, I pulled the tissue I had stashed in my bra out and began dabbing at my eyes.\\n\\n “Do you Mace take Scarlett to be—”\\n\\n “Hell yes!” Mace rushed out cutting off the celebrant. The entire room erupted in laughter at his eager response.\\n\\n “Very well then, I now pronounce you husband and wife.” By this stage, I was choking up so badly I almost missed the next part. “You may now ki—“ The poor guy didn’t even get to finish before Mace had Scarlett pinned to his body giving her a kiss that was sure to make the room spontaneously combust. Cheers, whistles and loud clapping bounced off the walls. Sniffling, I mopped up the last of my tears and cleared my throat, ready to finish out the rest of my bridesmaid duties. I was so proud at the moment; I could have burst.\\n\\n Following behind the bride and groom, Trip stepped up beside me placing his hand on my exposed back and leaning in close. His hot breath touching my ear, he whispered, “You looked fucking beautiful up there, Princess.” Dropping a small kiss to my cheek, he pulled away and kept walking beside me until we had made our way outside for the quick yet silent drive to Bob’s bar for their reception. Yes, Bob’s bar. It was the place Mace took Scar on their first date so it was a no-brainer, and the only thing Mace had asked for.\\n\\n Damn. My feet hurt.\\n\\n I was almost certain they were completely swollen and stuck into my shoes. I wiggled my toes to try and alleviate some of the pressure. I was starving because this kid apparently didn’t like me going more than an hour without shoving something in my mouth and I needed a nap.\\n\\n Hundreds of photos had been taken before we’d even made it back to the reception; it was time for Scar and Mace’s first dance and Trip was nowhere to be seen. If it weren’t for the fact I had my eyes on his dumbass date, I would have thought he was off banging her. My stomach churned at the thought. I was thinking I should have stipulated no bimbos on the non-exclusive rule.\\n\\n Could I do that? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/conflicted-love-needle-s-kiss-2/page-12.html","bookId":1955,"book":{"id":1955,"title":"Conflicted Love (Needle\u0027s Kiss #2)","description":"Storyline: Conflicted Love (Needle\u0027s Kiss #2) \\n Trip’s life motto is simple: get in, get off, get out.
