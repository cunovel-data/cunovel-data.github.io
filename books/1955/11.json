Remy had been at Needle’s Kiss since Scarlett first opened her doors.\n “What?” I asked “Why? I’m so sorry. That’s bad timing, babe.” Why he’d leave right when Scarlett needed him was beyond me.\n “It’s sad to see him go but he has some family issues to sort through. He wasn’t very forthcoming, but I know it means he has to move away and he doesn’t have a lot of time.” She shrugged shaking her head, and then jumped up and snagged another beer from the fridge before turning back to me, eyes pleading. “This is why I really need you in the shop. I know you won’t be able to do full time and you can make your own hours or whatever, but I do need the help and if I could choose one person to take over for him,” she smiled softly, “it’d be you.”\n My throat clenched. “Shit, don’t get all squishy on me. I will cry, you know! And I’m so freakin’ sick of crying. Stupid tears.” I sniffed busying myself with pulling snacks out and dumping them in bowls. “One more day, honey. One more and you’ll be a missus,” I reminded her, changing the subject on the sly and attempting to ignore the fact that I’d not only be living with Trip but working very closely with him for the foreseeable future. Denial. That was the best way to deal with it. At least, that’s what I’d keep telling myself.\n A big smirk behind her beer bottle was her only reply to that. She was happy which in-turn made me more than just happy. Instantly, she ruined my feeling of elation by opening her mouth “So, you and Trip, huh?” Ah, fuck here we go, I thought rolling my eyes.\n “It’s just convenience. We’re living under the same roof and my hormones are apparently turning me into a horny sixteen-year-old boy seeing his first boob and…well… Trip is a sixteen-year-old boy trapped in a very fuckable, well-sculptured man-candy body.” My mouth started to water at the thought of that very sculptured body and what it’d done to me not twenty minutes before Scar had walked in. “It’s nothing. Just scratching each other’s itches is all.” And boy, oh boy, did the man know how to scratch an itch.\n “You, my sweet little Teeny, are blushing like a schoolgirl in a confessional.” She laughed, “You can’t bullshit a bullshitter, babe. You’ve been crushin’ on that boy for years and you’re telling me it’s just sex? Nope. Not buying it.” She shook her head “I know you as well as I know myself, and any chance you’ve ever gotten you’ve eye fucked the shit out of that boy.”\n I broke out in a sweat and repeated completely unconvincingly—myself entirely aware of the fact I was trying to assure both of us, “It is just sex.”\n Scarlett simply smiled, picked up her plate of food and wandered into the living room. Luckily for me, the doorbell sounded letting me know Trip’s sisters were here. “I got it,” Scar called out leaving my lying ass to organize the drinks.\n “What the fuck?” Halfway through a game of Never Have I Ever, I was sitting cross-legged on the floor mouth gaping open at Haven’s empty glass after Scarlet pulled out the ‘I’ve never had sex on a Harley’ question. Not only was I processing the fact that only my juice and Haven’s shot were gone but there weren’t many people in town that owned Harleys and she looked more than a little guilty.\n “Never have I ever slept with—,“ my question was cut short when the front door swung open and four of the hottest guys I’d ever see stumbled inside, all in varying degrees of drunk off their tits, except for the designated driver and man in question, Jude.\n “Haven,” I whispered gaining her attention from the doorway. “He’s your brother’s best friend, honey.” The blush that tinged her cheeks along with the sideward glace toward the door answered any doubt I may have had. “Ah, shit,” I mumbled. Haven bit her lip and quickly looked away.\n “I’ve come to drag you to my den,” Mace announced on a loud slur causing Scar to giggle hysterically. “Don’t laugh. I am caveman.” He jabbed his thumb into his own chest and then pointed at Scarlett. “You pretty lady. Cave, now.”\n “Mace, you aren’t supposed to see her until the morning,” I reminded him as Trip came up behind me plopping down with a leg either side of mine.\n “S’okay, I’ll bring her back in an hour,” he smiled and hauled her out the door.\n “What’re we playin’, Princess?” Trip whispered in my ear; his warm breath sent a pleasant shiver over my body and scattered my thoughts.\n “Um,” was that all I could muster as a reply? Um? His tongue darted out when he kissed the spot on my neck he knew made my knees weak. With a sigh, I gave in and tilted my neck to the side giving him more access. Who the hell was I kidding? Gave in? I’d given in weeks ago and this meant I was in big trouble.\n “You girls stayin’?” Trip gruffly asked his sisters.\n “I’ll take ‘em home,” Jude jumped in snapping his eyes away from Haven. Busted. “I have to take Remy anyway.” I couldn’t very well go and say anything with Trip sucking on my neck and a room full of people, so I settled for a very pointed look as Haven, who quickly grabbed her bag and shoes, hightailing it out the door behind everyone.\n “We’re alone,” Trip growled into my throat where his lips were still working against my overheated skin. “I’m so hard I could cut glass and there’s only one place I want my cock.” My shoulders relaxed at his admission of not sleeping with anyone that night, I was constantly worried my stupidity would blow up in my face. I knew how much of a fool I was telling him we weren’t exclusive, but it was the only thing I could do to show him I wasn’t interested in having a real relationship. I should rephrase that; it was the only thing I could think to do to get him to move on from me, and let me be alone. In the meantime though, that itch was getting scratched.\n Trip’s hand snaking around the front of me and up my skirt pulled me from my thoughts. “You okay, Princess?”\n “I will be in a minute,” I smiled as his fingers gently ghosted up my inner thigh.\n “What where you girls playing?” he asked nibbling on my ear. My breathing picked up right along with my libido.\n “Never Have I Ever,” I breathed out finding it hard to concentrate with his mouth and fingers going places.\n “Hmmm.” The rumble of his voice shot right through me burning its path directly to my crotch. “Your glass is empty. What was the last question before I walked in?” What? My foggy brain couldn’t comprehend what he was asking; it was preoccupied. His fingers disappeared from running slow lines along the junction of my thigh and aching pussy when I didn’t answer him.\n “Have you ever had sex on a Harley?” I pouted at the loss of his hand.\n “You liked me drilling you on my bike, didn’t you?” he asked brushing my hair away from the back of my neck. “You’re the only chick ever been on my girl. Fucked or otherwise.” I gasped when he ran his tongue along the shell of my ear. “We need to do that again sometime. I loved having you spread out, my cock buried in you.” Trip’s dirty mouth only served to work me up even more. Flipping the switch, he pulled me up onto my knees in a demanding gesture.\n “Mmhmm.” I loved when he got all macho and took control; it turned me on like nothing else. I also really loved drunk sex with Trip. It was out-of-this-world good and happening immediately if I had anything to do with it.\n Trip\n “You want this, Princess?” I ground my hips against her, one hand gripping her hip the other running back up and under her skirt.\n Teeny pushed her ass back into me and whimpered. I could feel the heat even with my hand inches away from her cunt. She was primed and ready to go. Good thing too ‘cause I needed in her like I needed to breathe. I was so hard my dick was throbbing like a motherfucker. So hard it hurt.\n “I need in you now, baby.” My voice was low and husky with hunger. I was still buzzed from drinking, which meant I needed it hard and fast.\n “Oh, yeah,” she moaned low in her throat when I pulled her lacey panties to the side and slid two fingers in. I nearly came on the spot with how wet she was. Primed was an understatement; she was nearing explosion. Damn, this woman could bring me to my knees. In more ways than one.\n “Gonna go hard, baby.” After a few quick thrusts of my fingers, I pulled them out and licked them clean. Fuck, I loved the taste of her! I pressed down on her back showing her how I wanted her and lifted her skirt up so her perky ass was perfectly lined up. One hand wrapped around her panties and the other freeing my cock, I nudged her legs apart.\n “Love you on your hands and knees,” I murmured and let go of my dick, only to tear the lace that was barely covering her clean in half and threw it behind me. “Owe you another pair,” I distractedly mentioned, because God only knew how many pairs I’d already torn. Running one hand across her smooth skin, the other wrapped around my hard on, I moved my hand slowly from base to tip and then back again. Teeny was breathing like she’d run a marathon, I bent and used my teeth, tongue and lips against her lush cheeks, all the way down and between her thighs.\n Fuck, she was so responsive. Rubbing the tip of my dick through the wet heat between her pussy lips, I braced a hand tight on her hip, my fingers digging in.\n “Trip, I need you in me,” she said hoarsely rocking back and forward trying to impale herself on my shaft. She was that desperately turned on. Without any more thought, I slammed home balls deep and threw my head back with a long growl. Drawing back, I did it again. Teeny clamped down on me and started riding out her orgasm. I’d barely touched her, but we had a raw sexual passion that I’d never had with anyone else before. I couldn’t get enough of her. I wanted to stay buried deep inside her for the rest of my sorry-assed life.\n “Fuck, fuck, fuck. Oh fuck!” she screamed out as I pounded into her. The carpet beginning to burn my knees didn’t even register as I reached up to pinch her nipple hard. She threw her own head back and screamed loud uncaring who heard her as she gripped my dick like a vise.\n She loved it rough.\n Sweat beading across my back, I reached up ripping my shirt off, never breaking my merciless thrusting.\n The hand I had on her breast came back to swat her gently on the ass testing her. Yelling out in bliss, she pushed her hips back into mine. Oh, yeah, my girl liked it dirty. I swiftly pulled out and flipped her onto her back; the need to own her overwhelming me. Teeny’s hand instantly went to her clit rubbing in a small figure of eight, her hooded eyes on me. I took my throbbing cock in my hand and stroked back and forth, back and forth, faster, flicking my wrist as I felt my balls draw up tight. I leant over her, thrusting my fingers into her heat as she came apart. When she did, it wasn’t the name Trip that came from her mouth. It was my real name. The name no woman has ever screamed during sex. The name no woman but her had ever had the right to scream out like that. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/conflicted-love-needle-s-kiss-2/page-11.html","bookId":1955,"book":{"id":1955,"title":"Conflicted Love (Needle\u0027s Kiss #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Conflicted Love (Needle\u0027s Kiss #2) \n Trip’s life motto is simple: get in, get off, get out.
