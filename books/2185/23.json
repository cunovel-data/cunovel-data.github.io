{"id":100161,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"The rains came heavy the next day, a soaking downpour under thick black clouds that stretched from horizon to horizon. Never before had the people of Braemar so welcomed such gloom. \"The wyrm\u0027ll not come forth in this,\" Mickey remarked to his four companions when the group gathered in the remaining, unburned area of the Snoozing Sprite for breakfast. \"But how long will the rains last?\" Kelsey was quick to put in, and to Gary, it seemed as if the elf was on the verge of a tirade. Every time Kelsey had looked upon Mickey the previous night, and this morn, his eyes had been filled with hatred, and every word he spoke in response to the leprechaun was edged with venom. Kelsey\u0027s obvious rage seemed to roll off Mickey\u0027s rounded shoulders. The leprechaun had his precious pot of gold back; nothing in all the world bothered Mickey anymore. \"The defense will be stronger the next time Robert arrives,\" Kelsey promised the others, looking individually to each of them, with the notable exception of Mickey. \"Ger-bil will aid in the construction of a catapult this day, and with Geno ...\" \"Save your breath, elf,\" the dwarf interrupted. \"Me and my kin are out of Braemar this day. With the dragon still about, we\u0027ve got our own homes to worry about.\" Kelsey started to reply, but stopped short and gave a resigned nod. He couldn\u0027t rightly judge the dwarf\u0027s decision, for the Firth of Buldre, the dwarfish homeland, was not so far from Braemar, certainly less distance than a flying dragon could cover in just a few hours. \"That might be a good place for all of us to make our stand,\" Gary interjected, remembering the dwarfish place, remembering the towering waterfalls and the continuous spray, and the thick-walled rocky caves that Geno and his kin called home. All eyes turned to the young man - three of Gary\u0027s companions seemed intrigued. The exception, Geno, was quick to respond. \"You\u0027re not bringing a bunch of human farmers to the Firth,\" he snorted. \"You\u0027d let them die?\" Gary answered sharply. \"Yes.\" The answer was plain and comfortably spoken, and Gary eased back in his chair, his pending arguments deflated by Geno\u0027s callousness. The dwarf only gave the man a gap-toothed grin, further evidence that he was perfectly content. \"I think that the lad\u0027s on to something,\" Mickey said. \"No,\" Geno replied evenly, his clear blue eyes sparkling and his grin replaced by a determined scowl. \"Not to the Firth,\" Mickey went on. \"Ye couldn\u0027t rightly be bringing human folk in such numbers to that place.\" Mickey was talking more to Gary than to Geno now, filling in the details that Geno hadn\u0027t bothered to add. \"Never again would the dwarfs find peace, and if human greed is more than legend ...\" \"And it is,\" Geno added, and even Gerbil was nodding. \"... then ye\u0027d be sure to be starting a war, if everything else sorted out,\" Mickey explained. He looked to Geno hopefully, his dimples evident and all his face turned up in a hopeful grin. \"But there be other waterfalls and other deep caves in wide Dvergamal where the folk o\u0027 Braemar might hide.\" \"And what of the folk of Drochit?\" the dwarf asked, hints of sarcasm growing with every passing word. \"And the hamlet of Lisdoonvarna, to the north and west? And Dilnamarra? Are you thinking to put the whole of Faerie\u0027s humans in mountain holes, leprechaun?\" \"I\u0027m thinking to steal us some time,\" Mickey replied curtly. \"For, as Kelsey said, the rains won\u0027t be lasting too long.\" Baron Pwyll came in then, looking thoroughly exhausted and perfectly hopeless. He grabbed a stool and brought it near the companions\u0027 table, then paused, as if awaiting permission to sit down. Kelsey shifted his own seat and motioned for the Baron to join them. Pwyll\u0027s account of the progress in the town was bleak indeed, and the Baron informed them that Robert had been seen again, flying from the east to a roost in the mountains north of Braemar. \"As soon as the rains end,\" the Baron reasoned grimly, meaning that there was no doubt but that the angry dragon would return. Geno sent a stream of thick spittle splattering to the floor. \"Round them up, then,\" he growled, at Mickey and at Kelsey. \"I\u0027ll find you a hole - little good it will do you when Robert comes a-calling!\" The dwarf\u0027s last grim statement was true enough, they all knew, but the simple fact that Geno had made the concession at all brought smiles to the faces of both the elf and the leprechaun. Gary, too, gained some hope, and some faith in his stocky companion. For all the dwarf\u0027s gruffness, Gary liked Geno, and the dwarf\u0027s refusal to open his home to people in such dire need had disheartened the young man profoundly. Kelsey quickly explained their plan to Baron Pwyll. \"We will be ready to leave before nightfall,\" the Baron promised hopefully, and he rushed out of the tavern soon after, to speak with Badenoch and make the necessary arrangements. \"It\u0027s a short-term fix,\" Mickey offered after a short period of silence. \"And not to last the length o\u0027 time we\u0027re needing.\" \"I should have let Ceridwen out,\" Gary said. \"Ceridwen wouldn\u0027t be helping us any,\" Mickey answered. They all sat quietly for a few minutes, pondering their predicament. Again, Mickey was the first to speak. \"Ye\u0027ll not be taking the sword along for the walk,\" he said to Gary. \"Suren it\u0027s a torch on a dark night to Robert\u0027s eyes, and if ye bringed it in the caves, the dragon\u0027d find the folk soon enough.\" Gary narrowed his eyes and ran his hand through his matted, straight black hair, digesting the information. \"How is it a torch on a dark night?\" he asked. \"I telled ye before,\" Mickey replied. \"Dragons know their treasures, and I\u0027d put that sword\u0027s value above any other treasures that Robert holds - to Robert, anyway. He can smell the damned thing a hundred miles away, I tell ye.\" \"Then why did you bring it?\" Geno growled at the leprechaun. In response, Mickey looked to Gary, laying the blame where it surely belonged. \"I knew that we\u0027d have to fight the dragon, sooner or later,\" Gary replied with some confidence, for he was beginning to formulate a crazy and desperate plan. \"I figured that the sword would be the bait we needed to get Robert on our own terms. \"Are you sure that Robert will come for this?\" he asked Mickey. \"Like a babe to its mother,\" the leprechaun replied. \"We have to count on that,\" Gary said evenly. \"I can use me magic to set the sword a-singing,\" Mickey said, but it was obvious that the leprechaun wasn\u0027t thrilled with his own idea. And who could blame him? Not many would willingly call an outraged wyrm, especially one as powerful and wicked as Robert. Gary didn\u0027t quite understand what the leprechaun was talking about, but he figured that Mickey meant that he could somehow enhance the sword\u0027s signals to its hunting master. He had to let it go at that, at least for the time being, for the plan was flooding his thoughts then, and he had to speak it out loud so that he and his friends might help him sort through it. Geno scoffed and Kelsey shook his head, his lips tight with obvious doubts. Mickey listened impassively, seeming more polite than interested, and only Gerbil, the gnome inventor who understood the possibilities of precise measurements, leaned forward in his chair, certainly intrigued. Gary fought off all interruption attempts by Kelsey, and especially the doubting dwarf, attempts that came less and less as he stubbornly went through the mechanics of his plan. \"Oh, begorra,\" the leprechaun sighed when Gary had at last finished speaking. Mickey looked around to the others, Gerbil smiling widely, Geno eyeing Gary doubtfully, and Kelsey sitting back in his chair, his slender arms crossed over his chest and his magnificent golden orbs staring blankly off into space. Apparently sensing the leprechaun\u0027s gaze, the elf turned to eye Mickey directly and offered a shrug. \"Might be that we\u0027ve got nothing better,\" Mickey admitted, turning to Gary. Not so long afterwards, Kelsey and Gerbil, atop the pony, charged out of Braemar, running fast to the north. Normally it would take four days of hard riding to make the trip from Braemar to Gondabuggan, but Kelsey had promised his friends that he would make it within two, despite the deepening mud. Mickey, Gary, Geno, and Pwyll watched him go, the fat Baron shaking his head doubtfully, not fully understanding what the unpredictable and dangerous friends were up to. To Pwyll\u0027s thinking, splitting the forces in such dark times was not a wise move. \"And now where are you three off to?\" he demanded, for it was obvious that the remaining companions were packed for the road. \"Kelsey said two days,\" Gary said to Mickey, both of them ignoring the Baron. \"So in two days, you\u0027ll use your magic to start the sword singing.\" \"It\u0027ll hum a merry tune,\" Mickey assured him. \"I had thought that you would be helping me to make the move,\" Pwyll firmly interrupted. \"The people of Braemar ...\" \"The folk\u0027ll get out on their own, don\u0027t ye doubt,\" Mickey interrupted, his tone casual. \"And Geno\u0027s kin\u0027ll point them right.\" The leprechaun paused then, and scratched at his brown-and-gray beard, eyeing Pwyll all the while. \"What?\" the anxious Baron demanded. \"Ye know, lad,\" Mickey said coyly to Gary. \"I\u0027m thinking that yer plan\u0027s to work - of course, it has to work, or nothing else is worth talking about. But I\u0027m thinking beyond that plan o\u0027 yers, lad, thinking to what gains we might be making for the trouble that\u0027s sure to come even if old Robert is dead and gone.\" The leprechaun\u0027s mischievous gaze then descended over Pwyll, with Gary and Geno gradually understanding and following the lead. \"What?\" the Baron demanded again, looking from one hungry gaze to the other and wondering if he should, perhaps, turn tail and run off to find Badenoch. \"How are ye at mountain hiking?\" Mickey asked. It rained for the remainder of that day, and all night as well. The soggy companions, trekking gingerly but determinedly along slippery mountain trails, found the sky brightening the next morn, a sign that brought mixed emotions. \"Suren the wyrm\u0027s rested by now,\" Mickey reasoned, looking back ominously along the trails towards distant Braemar. Then the leprechaun looked up to the gray sky, the overcast fast thinning. \"We\u0027ve another few hours of rain, and then Robert\u0027ll be hitting the town all in a fury.\" Baron Pwyll groaned, a common sound to the companions. Pwyll had argued to his last breath with Badenoch that he should remain with the townspeople, and not go running off on some wild adventure into the mountains. But Mickey and Gary had gotten to Badenoch first, and the leader of Braemar would hear nothing of \"holding back the valiant Baron of Dilnamarra.\" Still, even with none listening to his whining arguments, it took a dwarfish hand tugging Pwyll by the ear to get his feet moving on the first part of the trip, the trail from Braemar into the foothills. To Pwyll\u0027s credit, after that he had kept the pace fairly well, but now, in the uncomfortably humid and warm air as the sun tried to bake its way through the stubborn clouds, the overweight man was sweating profusely, huffing and puffing with every step. \"At least the people won\u0027t be there when the dragon arrives,\" Gary added hopefully. \"Aye, but the wyrm\u0027ll fast figure the truth of it,\" Mickey said. \"Then Robert\u0027ll go a-hunting. Even with all the rain, the dragon will sniff them out for sure.\" Gary cupped a hand over his eyes to diminish the glare as he stared up into the thinning overcast. \"A few hours?\" he asked. \"If you care as much for the folk of Braemar as you make out, then you\u0027ll get your legs walking faster!\" Geno, who had spoken very little since they had set out the day before, said unexpectedly, poking a stubby finger into Pwyll\u0027s ample behind. \"I can get us to the spot in a few hours,\" the dwarf explained to Mickey and Gary, \"but not if this one\u0027s meaning to stop every twenty steps for a rest!\" Mickey started to respond, words of comfort to Pwyll, it seemed, but Gary cut him short. \"Go on, then,\" the young man said to Geno. \"The Baron will keep up - or he will be left behind.\" \"Left behind?\" Pwyll cried out. \"In these perfectly awful mountains?\" The Baron sucked in his breath immediately, realizing that it was not so wise a thing to insult Dvergamal in the presence of a dwarf. \"How would you like to take a perfectly awful flight?\" Geno grumbled. \"Left behind,\" Gary said more forcefully, drawing a surprised \"Oo\" from Mickey. \"I value the lives of the more than two hundred fleeing Braemar over the safety of a single man, even a Baron.\" Unblinking, uncompromising, Gary looked over to Geno and said, \"Go.\" The dwarf\u0027s stout legs churned powerfully, sending Geno rolling along at a great pace. They had been traveling a narrow path around the girth of a wide mountain, but now Geno led them straight up its side, then into a ravine, and up a wall across the way, this one almost sheer. They had no ropes, but Geno led the way, speaking to the stones and then jabbing his granite-hard hand straight into the rock wall, leaving a ladder of hand- and footholds for his companions to utilize. Despite the bulky armor, and the weight of Mickey, Gary went on tirelessly, hand over hand, reminding himself every few feet not to look down. Baron Pwyll came far behind, had managed to climb just a few rungs before he eased himself back down and announced that he simply could not go on. \"Carrying fat Barons will surely slow me down!\" Geno growled, regarding the man, now a hundred feet below them. \"Leave him,\" Gary said firmly. \"His chances here will be no worse than his chances beside us!\" Mickey started to protest, but Gary\u0027s last statement, so terribly true, locked the leprechaun\u0027s words fast in his throat. Geno yelled down directions to Pwyll, told him to follow the raving to the north, then fork to the east, where he would find a rocky vale below the intended pass. The Baron called up some typical complaints, but the friends, nearing the top of the climb, weren\u0027t listening. Just over the lip, Geno led them into a tight and dark cave, and Mickey put up a ball of faerie light as he and Gary followed the dwarf in. Geno looked back at the sprite, scowling, and Mickey remembered how Geno felt about lights of any kind in his dark caverns. \"We can\u0027t be running along in the dark,\" the leprechaun reasoned, and the dwarf snorted and led on, and both Gary and Mickey were surely relieved. They exited the tunnel more than an hour later, coming to a high and flat rock that afforded them a panoramic view of the region south and east. The sun was beaming by then, the overcast fully burned away. Lines of gray smoke drifted lazily into the air far to the southeast, painfully visible though the companions were more than twenty miles from Braemar. \"Alas for the Snoozing Sprite,\" remarked Geno, honestly wounded. \"Ye can\u0027t get a log wet enough to resist dragon fire,\" Mickey added grimly. Even as they watched, another stream of smoke came up, rising to mesh with the unnatural cloud hanging over the ruined town. All three winced, Mickey shaking his head and Geno squeezing a rock that he held in his hand into little pieces. Gary, though, after his initial shock, found some welcome information in the newest column, for the smoke told him beyond doubt that Robert was still over the town. \"How far are we from the pass?\" he asked Geno. \"An hour\u0027s walk,\" the dwarf replied. \"Half an hour\u0027s run,\" Gary corrected. He turned a wistful grin on Mickey. \"Lad, what\u0027re ye smiling about?\" the leprechaun wanted to know. \"Set the sword to singing,\" Gary replied. \"Let\u0027s pull Robert away before he can find the villagers\u0027 trail.\" \"We don\u0027t even know that Kelsey and the gnome have got to Gondabuggan,\" Mickey argued. \"We can\u0027t go calling the dragon until we know!\" Gary understood the logic, understood that to call the dragon now would be gambling the lives of Braemar\u0027s folk against the entire success of his plan, against the potential for a complete disaster. But Gary wouldn\u0027t sit by and watch any more of Faerie\u0027s fine people be slaughtered. This was his plan, he trusted in Kelsey, and he was in a gambling mood. \"Do it,\" he said. Mickey looked to Geno for some answers, but the dwarf just looked away. From the beginning, Geno had made it clear that he was their guide and nothing more, that he would be long gone into deep caverns at first sight of the wyrm. Mickey let out a heaving breath, then reached down Gary\u0027s back to touch the hilt of the huge sword. He uttered an enchantment over the blade and tapped his finger atop the hilt. \"We\u0027d best be running,\" Mickey said to Gary. \"Will the dragon hear it?\" Gary asked. \"Already has,\" the sprite answered grimly. Gary turned back to say some word of encouragement to Geno, and saw that the dwarf was off and running along the trail. They came to the spot some time later with no sign of the dragon yet evident. Gary considered the layout of the place carefully, trying to fathom how he could choreograph this delicate situation. Geno showed him the marks he was looking for, deep scratches and scorches along the wall of stone. A wry smile crossed Gary\u0027s face when he noticed that this spot was conveniently located above a flat area that would serve as a perch, even for a beast as large as Robert. Gary pointed this out to the dwarf, then handed over the sword. Taking the weapon, Geno scrambled up some stones and onto the intended perch. He moved under great hanging slabs of stone, resembling the enormous front teeth of some gigantic monster, but if the dwarf cared that tons of rock were hanging precariously above his head, he did not show it. Holding the sword out before him (he couldn\u0027t even reach the crosspiece to the hilt with its tip poking against the stone), Geno closed his eyes and began to chant quietly, a grumbling, grating sound, as though he was talking to the mountain itself. And he was. A moment later, the dwarf gently pushed the weapon down, the stone simply parting around the blade as it sunk deeper and deeper. When Geno had finished, only the hilt and a couple of inches of steel showed above the flat area. Mickey, meanwhile, had not been idle. Peering to the north and east, the leprechaun pulled out his umbrella and floated high into the air. He extended the fingers of his free hand and uttered a fast chant. Sparks erupted from Mickey\u0027s fingertips, drawing green and red lines in the air. He kept up the display for several seconds, then fell quiet, feeling incredibly vulnerable hanging in midair, with a flying dragon almost surely on the way. \"Come on, then,\" Mickey whispered to himself, peering towards distant Gondabuggan, and then all around anxiously. A silver flash showed in the far distance, once and then again. Mickey\u0027s smile took in his prominent ears. He snapped his umbrella shut and dropped like a stone, to be caught by a surprised Gary Leger. \"Kelsey got there, laddie!\" the sprite cried. He grabbed Gary\u0027s ears and pulled him close, giving him a kiss on the cheek. \"Oh, he got there!\" The mirth was stolen a split second later, by a roar that only a dragon - only a tricked and robbed dragon - could make. \"Time to go,\" proclaimed the dwarf, and, true to his word, Geno hopped down from the small plateau, rushed up to an opposite mountain wall and called to the stone. What had seemed just a small crack widened suddenly, and the dwarf, with a look back to Gary and Mickey, prudently stepped in. \"If you get killed,\" he offered hopefully to Gary, and he paused, as if fumbling to think of something positive to say. \"Well, stonebubbles, then you\u0027ll get killed!\" Geno bellowed, and he was gone and the stone snapped shut behind him. \"Loyal bunch, them dwarfs,\" Mickey said dryly. \"But Geno would let us in, lad, if ye\u0027ve changed yer mind.\" That was among the most tempting offers Gary Leger had ever heard - and it only got more tempting when another roar, a closer roar, echoed off the mountain walls. Gary shook his head resolutely. \"We\u0027ve got to do this,\" he said, reminding himself privately that he was part of something bigger, that there was a point to this that transcended his own mortality. Another roar sounded, seeming to come from just beyond the next ridge. Gary Leger set Mickey down on the ground and took up his spear. He hadn\u0027t come this far to turn and run at the moment of truth.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dragon-s-dagger-spearwielder-s-tale-2/page-23.html","bookId":2185,"book":{"id":2185,"title":"The Dragon\u0027s Dagger (Spearwielder\u0027s Tale #2)","description":"Storyline: The Dragon\u0027s Dagger (Spearwielder\u0027s Tale #2) The sequel to The Woods Out Back.
