{"id":100147,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"Mickey and Gary found Geno lying half-buried in the soft ground, spitting curses and spitting muck, with Baron Pwyll standing helplessly over him. It took some effort - the dwarf seemed to weigh as much as an equal volume of lead - but by freeing up Geno\u0027s arms from their encumbering logs and using those logs as levers, Gary and Pwyll finally managed to stand the grumpy tree-dwarf upright. \"Stupid plan,\" Geno growled, smashing wildly at his bark trappings until he had split the log in half. He came out of the suit and scraped the mud from his body, flicked a few confused insects from his arms and shoulders, and ate a few more that looked too tasty to resist. Even the meal did little to improve the dwarf\u0027s mood. \"Stupid plan,\" he said again. On impulse, before Gary could react, the dwarf reached up and slugged Gary in the shoulder, launching him sidelong to land in the muck. \"It worked!\" the startled young man protested, louder than he should have. All four went quiet immediately, fearing the consequences of Gary\u0027s cry, but when they stopped making so much noise, they heard the general commotion Gary\u0027s plan had caused. Screams and shrieks cut through the night fog, calls of ghosts, of headless horsemen, and of the trees themselves turning against the force. Further confirmation of the success came a few moments later, when Kelsey rode up, his head free of the highlaced tunic and a smile wide upon his fair face. \"They are in complete disarray,\" the elf remarked. \"Stupid plan,\" Geno said again, under his beetle-tainted breath. \"The Prince was not swayed by the claims of his returning men,\" Kelsey explained. \"He blamed it on demon magics, and said that we would surely hang for our evil tricks.\" \"Then some of them are still coming,\" Mickey reasoned. Kelsey\u0027s smile widened as he shook his head. \"For all of Prince Geldion\u0027s determination, even he was taken aback by a trick that was not of our doing.\" The elf paused, inviting a guess, and Mickey\u0027s grin came to equal Kelsey\u0027s as he caught on. \"Geldion passed the swamp with the ghoul,\" the leprechaun reasoned. Kelsey laughed aloud. \"It seems that Prince Geldion called it an illusion, a magic trick. He even walked up to it as it crawled out of the muck to prove to his men that it was only an image and nothing substantial. The Prince wears a scar on his cheek for his foolishness.\" It was all very welcome news, but Gary only half listened as Kelsey went on to explain that the Connacht soldiers had backtracked out of the swamp and would be far from the trail when they exited Cowtangle. Gary thought of the monster, the undead ghoul, they had seen crawling out of the muck, a monster that was, apparently, very real indeed. Now that the tricks were over and the immediate threat had been put off, the hairs on the back of Gary Leg-er\u0027s neck began to tingle. What the hell were they so happy about? he thought. They were in the middle of a haunted swamp, complete with ghouls, on a dark night. Gary\u0027s heart did not slow any when he saw a stilted, leaning form coming slowly through the glowing mist. \"Where are the horses?\" he asked, loudly enough to interrupt the continuing conversation. \"I tethered them a short distance ahead,\" Baron Pwyll explained. \"Couldn\u0027t have them wandering about in this evil place.\" \"We should get to them,\" Gary offered, and he nodded ahead to guide the curious gazes of the others. A rare gust of the wind cleared the mist temporarily, and Gary\u0027s mouth dropped open wide. He saw the creature, a badly decomposed body of a long-dead man, skin hanging in loose flaps, one eye fallen back into its head, and, to his horror, Gary Leger recognized the corpse. \"Dad,\" he mouthed, hardly able to spit the word. \"We weren\u0027t for staying anyway,\" he heard Mickey say, and a moment later, Kelsey grabbed him by the shoulder and tugged at him. Gary resisted, or, at least, his planted feet made no move to help the movement. Kelsey called for help and Geno came over, wrapped his muscular arms around Gary\u0027s legs, and hoisted the man clear of the ground. They soon outdistanced the night creature, leaving it behind in a swirl of fog, but that awful image hung heavy in Gary\u0027s mind, stealing any words from his impossibly dry mouth, long after they had retrieved the mounts, long after they had picked their way along the muddy paths, long after they had exited the swamp and then the wood altogether. Sitting in the nook between Gary and the horse\u0027s neck, Mickey soon recognized the true source of his friend\u0027s distress. \"Ye knew the ghost,\" the leprechaun stated, understanding the tricks of night creatures quite well. Gary just nodded, couldn\u0027t even manage a verbal response, his words caught fast by the image of his father as a corpse. \"They\u0027ll do that to ye,\" Mickey explained, seeing clearly what had happened and trying to put Gary at ease. \"Them spirits\u0027re smart, lad. They look into yer head and see what\u0027ll most get at ye.\" Gary nodded and Mickey fell silent, knowing that he could do no more for his friend. The words did comfort Gary a bit, but that image remained, powerful and horrible. A large part of Gary wanted to be done with this adventure at once, wanted to go back to the other world, the real world, to ensure that his dear father was all right. They rode hard and fast over the course of the next day, and started out early the day after that, the Tir na n\u0027Og mounts running easily in the low brush not too far from the side of the eastern road. Kelsey had determined that they would go into the small farming and mining community of Braemar, unless Geldion beat them to the place, and learn if the dragon had been spotted out from his mountain home. With his sharp eyes, the elf, in the lead, spotted a disturbance farther up the road, a commotion he feared might involve the Prince. He veered his mount farther to the side, putting some distance between himself and the road, and bidding the others to follow. \"Something up ahead?\" Mickey asked, shielding his eyes with one hand and peering to the east, below the late morning sun. There came a distant shriek in answer. \"Damned Prince,\" Geno muttered. \"Or someone in trouble,\" Gary offered. He looked to Kelsey, almost begging permission to ride out and see what was about. \"It is not our affair,\" the elf said coolly, but Gary saw Kelsey unintentionally cringe when another cry cut the air. \"Of course it is,\" Gary said, and he gave a tug on the bridle and sent his mount leaping beyond Kelsey. A whistle and single word from the elf stopped the mount so abruptly that Gary nearly fell from his saddle, and Mickey did topple, popping open an umbrella that came from somewhere, somehow, and floated to the grass, a not-happy expression splayed across his cherubic face. \"You feel no responsibility to check this out?\" Gary asked bluntly, turning back in his saddle as soon as he was sure that Mickey was all right. Kelsey didn\u0027t immediately reply - which caught Gary somewhat off guard. \"I fear to proceed,\" Kelsey explained calmly. \"There is too much at stake for us to risk an encounter with Prince Geldion.\" \"Well, you won\u0027t have to proceed, elf,\" Geno offered, pointing past Gary to the road up ahead. \"Looks like the fight is coming to us.\" It was true enough. Gary turned back the other way to see a cloud of dust rising from the road, and stringing out in their direction. Above it fluttered a group of strange and ugly creatures, appearing as vicious monkeys, dark-furred, with too-wide eyes and red mouths lined by long fangs. They flew about on leathery bat wings, twelve feet across, and even from this distance, Gary could make out the hooked claws extending from their back feet. The road was up higher than the companions, and from this angle, they could not discern what the monstrous group was pursuing. Gary figured it to be a horseman, though he hadn\u0027t yet heard the pounding of hooves, for whatever or whoever it might be was moving with great speed. \"That looks more like Ceridwen\u0027s doing than Prince Geldion\u0027s,\" Mickey said, aiming his remark at Kelsey. \"They may be one and the same,\" the elf retorted, but it was obvious from Kelsey\u0027s hurried tone, and from the fact that he had already strung his bow, that the noble elf would not abandon whoever it was that was in peril on the road. \"Surely you\u0027re not thinking of attacking those monstrous things!\" Baron Pwyll said to him, blanching as he spoke. \"Find a rock to crawl under,\" Geno said, juggling three spinning hammers as he walked his pony beyond the fat man\u0027s mount. Gary liked what he was hearing, liked the fact that his companions, even surly Geno, seemed concerned with something beyond their specific business. How many times in his own world had he heard about people turning their heads and looking away when someone else was in trouble? \"Let me down, lad,\" Mickey said unexpectedly. Gary\u0027s ensuing stare was filled with disappointment, even disbelief. \"I\u0027ll only hinder yer fighting,\" Mickey explained. \"I\u0027ll be doing what I can, don\u0027t ye doubt, but ever have I been better at fighting from a distance.\" A sudden popping sound turned their attention back to the approaching fight. A burst of spinning missiles - they reminded Gary of the blades used on a circular saw - shot up into the air, cutting a myriad of angles that many of the monkey-monsters could not avoid. Two got their wings clipped; a third caught a missile squarely in the face, and dropped from sight. \"It\u0027s a gnome,\" Geno, who had gone up to the edge of the road, called back, and that fact inspired the dwarf to kick his pony into a roaring charge. Gary angled his horse right up to the road and thundered behind, easily catching up to the dwarf\u0027s pony, while Kelsey ran full out along the side of the road, holding fast to his mount with his legs, and fast to his drawn bow with his hands. He had ridden with leprechauns and fought against twelve-foot-tall trolls and mighty dragons, but Gary could hardly believe the sight that greeted him. It was a gnome, as Geno had declared, a creature somewhat resembling the stocky dwarf, but slighter of build and with a face not so carved of granite. The gnome sat low in a contraption that resembled two bicycles lashed side by side, a steering wheel and two panels full of levers encircling him. He pulled one, and Gary saw a coil at the side of the left front wheel unwind suddenly, hurling another handful of circular missiles up into the air. One monkey-monster, swooping low in an attack pass, caught the whole bunch in its face, wings, and belly, and was torn apart and thrown aside. But a score or more monkeys remained, synchronizing their dives at the frightened gnome. The monsters never even realized that the gnome had found some unlookedfor allies until an arrow cut the air and drove hard into the side of one monkey. A second arrow followed in quick order, and a third after that, both scoring hits. The monsters sang out with their shrieking voices, looking first to the side, the flying elf, and then ahead, to the fine knight and his long spear and to the dwarf, hammer cocked back over his head, charging side by side down the road. A few squeals from the largest of the monster band put the monkeys in order immediately, one small group breaking off in pursuit of the elf, another group, including the leader, remaining to dive at the gnome, and the largest band rushing straight ahead at the approaching riders. \"Keep a tight hold!\" Geno yelled at Gary. \"They\u0027ll try to pull you from your saddle!\" The dwarf hurled out his first hammer then, but the closest approaching monkey was agile enough to swerve aside. Geno, too, swerved, purposely splitting apart from Gary and going down to the side of the road opposite Kelsey in hopes of confusing the monsters. They were not stupid beasts, though, and while a few turned to follow the dwarf, the bulk kept their focus ahead, zooming for Gary. He brought the great spear up before him, resisted the urge to hurl it into the face of the closest monster. Keep your nerve, he thought, and told himself to trust in his armor and in his mount, and to follow the warrior training Donigarten\u0027s spear had given to him. Still, Gary Leger thought he was surely doomed as the group of more than ten of the winged monsters closed on him. They were larger than Gary had thought from a distance, fifty to eighty pounds apiece, surprisingly agile and swift, and with long and pointy white teeth, and hooked claws that certainly could, as Geno had warned, pull Gary from the saddle. Gary remembered the time when, as a kid, he had cornered a raccoon under his best friend\u0027s front porch. He\u0027d put on some work gloves and thought to climb under the porch and catch the critter, a cute little raccoon like the kind he had seen on TV. When that wild animal reared up on its hind legs and bared its formidable teeth, young Gary Leger had been smart enough to turn tail and scramble out. So how come I\u0027m not that smart now? he wondered, and then the time for wondering was over as he and the monkeys made their first pass. Ducking low, Gary poked ahead with the spear, nicking the lead monkey as it spun completely around in midair to avoid the strike. Riding past, Gary tried to bring the weapon back in line ahead of him, but he was into the gauntlet too fast. He took a hit on the shoulder, a wing buffeted him, spinning his helmet about so that he could not see, and his horse grunted as a claw opened a deep scratch along its muscled neck. Still, the pass was not nearly as bad as Gary had thought it would be; he took less than half the hits he had expected. He managed to right himself in the saddle, managed to right his helm, and looked back to find that many of the monkeys had swerved to either side of him and were now hovering some distance down the road, looking curiously Gary\u0027s way. And no wonder, for riding right beside Gary, one on either side, were two exact replicas of the man, complete with spear and armor. So surprised was Gary that he nearly charged on blindly right into the approaching gnome contraption. He found his wits, and realized the company to be Mickey\u0027s handiwork, in time to begin his turn to the side of the road. The six monkeys that went for Kelsey were met by a seemingly solid line of arrows, coming out so rapidly from the fast-riding elf that his hands were no more than a blur. The terrain was rough on the side of the road, though, and Kelsey bounced about, many of his shots going wide and wild. He scored three hits, two on the same beast that took that monkey down altogether. The other five came stubbornly on, though, even the one sporting an arrow shaft from its shoulder. They shrieked eagerly above the clapping pounding of their bat wings, and were almost upon Kelsey, wicked claws extended as they angled down for a swooping pass. Kelsey\u0027s horse cut so sharp a turn, right back towards the monkeys, that the elf was forced to grab on, hands and legs, just to keep in the saddle. Surprised, too, were the monkeys, and the horse dipped its head low, and Kelsey fell flat across its back as they passed right under the beasts, who were still too high to attempt any raking attacks. Kelsey straightened immediately and reared up his mount, readying his bow as he turned about and getting off several more shots before the monsters were able to reverse direction and come at him again in any coordinated fashion. The four monkeys that went after the smallest of the new foes were surprised indeed when a barrage of flying hammers - it seemed like there were at least twenty of the missiles - came out suddenly as they closed the final few yards. Metal slapped hard against leathery wings, crunched monkey bones, and took all the front teeth, top and bottom, from one hooting maw. Geno\u0027s pony came around, following the dwarf\u0027s call for a charge. Smiling that mischievous, gap-toothed smile, Geno took the bridle firmly in one hand and stood up on the pony\u0027s wide back, his stubby legs cocked for a spring. The closest monkey had just recovered from the hammer attack when its eyes widened once more in surprise, this time as the hammer-thrower, and not a hammer, soared its way. Geno hit the monster squarely, wrapping his powerful smithy arms about it and hugging as tightly as he could. The monkey clawed and bit, and beat its wings furiously, but even if those wings had not been entangled by the dwarf\u0027s ironlike grasp, they would not have supported Geno\u0027s solid weight. Down came the two, Geno twisting so that the beast was below him. The monkey stopped thrashing, stopped breathing, when they hit. Geno bounced off the flattened thing and hopped about. Just in time, for a second foe was in full flying charge, swooping for the fallen dwarf. \"Catch!\" Geno politely roared, whipping a hammer the monkey\u0027s way. The sharp crack as the weapon bounced off the creature\u0027s skull sounded like a gunshot, and the aimed plummet became a dead drop. A third flying beast, following the charge, wisely turned aside, though the fourth of the group continued on. This one was walking, however, not flying, with one wing tucked tight against its back and the other, shattered in the initial hammer barrage, dragging on the ground beside it. Geno\u0027s mischievous smile did not diminish. He flipped his hammer repeatedly into the air, catching it with the same hand, while his other hand beckoned the monsters to come and play. A monkey dove for the low-riding gnome - Gary thought that the little man, who already showed a line of blood across his high-browed forehead, was surely doomed. A tug on a lever and a metallic umbrella sprang up, angled above and to the side, and the monkey-monster bounced harmlessly aside. A second monkey, coming the other way, was closer, though, and Gary saw the gnome frantically reach for another, similar lever, probably designed to complete the umbrella covering. The gnome pulled, and there came a clicking sound, but nothing happened - nothing except that the gnome\u0027s face drained of blood as he looked at the swooping menace. Purely on instinct, Gary let fly the spear. It skewered the diving monkey and carried it away, launching it far over the back of the speeding quadricycle. Gary\u0027s horse thundered past the gnome a split-second later, Gary just catching the thumbs-up sign as he galloped past. Back up over the bluff and onto the road, his steed charged, and Gary bent low to the side, reaching down in an effort to retrieve the spear, lying with its dead quarry along the top of the bluff on the opposite side. He saw that it was just beyond his fingertips as he came near, and so he reached lower. Too low. The world become a spinning blur, filled with solid bumps and ringing armor, over the next few horrible seconds. When Gary finally stopped his tumbling fall, he found himself sitting against the base of the bluff. He heard his horse nickering, calling, from the road up above and behind him, and he instinctively struggled to stand, though he hardly remembered the fight in that confusing moment, and hardly remembered that there remained many monsters yet to battle. He got almost halfway up before the ground seemed to writhe to life, to leap at him and swallow him. Geno\u0027s muscled legs twitched, launching him ahead suddenly, and he barreled into the walking monkey. They wrapped arms and went into a roll, each biting hard into the other\u0027s neck. Geno\u0027s maw was not as strong as the beast\u0027s, but his neck was as hard as granite, and he did not fare badly. He looked up over the monkey\u0027s shoulder and saw its companion rushing in. Smiling, his mouth full of monkey flesh, the dwarf waited until the unsuspecting monkey was almost upon him, then jerked his arm free and met the charge with a flying hammer. The monkey tumbled to the ground, stunned but not dead, and the dwarf used that free arm to promptly pull it into the pile. They rolled about, all three thrashing wildly, the monkeys clawing and biting and Geno punching, kicking, head-butting and biting, and doing whatever else seemed to work. Blood, dwarven and monkey, mixed with dirt, caking all three in grime. Geno grabbed a tuft of hair on the back of one monkey\u0027s head and pulled the thing perpendicular across his chest as he rolled once more. Yanking as they came over, Geno managed to plant the facedown monkey\u0027s forehead firmly against the ground. With a growl, the dwarf forced the pile to continue to roll and the monkey screamed out in agony, its head bending over backwards and its neckbone snapping apart. With surprising strength, the beast jerked free of the dwarf\u0027s iron grip and went into a series of wild convulsions. It was out of the fight, though, twitching on the ground and fast dying. That left Geno one on one, and he looked down to see that the remaining monkey had used the distraction to its seeming advantage, its strong maw clamped tightly around Geno\u0027s bleeding forearm. The dwarf grunted and flexed his muscles, and his right arm, his smithy-hammer arm, tightened and bulged, forcing the monkey\u0027s mouth wider. Wider, too, went the disbelieving beast\u0027s eyes. \"You think that hurts?\" Geno asked it Incredulously. He looked to the gnawing monkey, then to the hand of his free and cocked arm. \"That doesn\u0027t hurt,\" he explained, and he extended his pinky finger and his index finger. \"Now this hurts!\" Geno\u0027s free arm shot about, his fingers diving into the monkey\u0027s eyes, driving the beast off his forearm. Geno\u0027s arm recoiled immediately, his hand balling into a fist, and he punched the creature square in the face. The monkey seemed to bounce to its feet, but stood there dazed, offering no defense as the dwarf stalked in and slammed it again. It bounced, but still stood, and then Geno\u0027s forehead splattered its nose all over its face and it flew away. It never hit the ground, though, as a strong dwarven hand caught it by the throat and held it up. Geno looked to his bloodied arm, wondered if the wound might slow his smithing business for a while. \"You shouldn\u0027t have done that,\" he explained to the semiconscious beast, and his powerful hand began to twist. In the span of six seconds, and a like number of lipping arrows, five monkeys had become two. Kelsey dropped his bow and drew out his sword, kicking his mount into a charge to meet headlong the next stubborn attack. The monkeys came at him together, one to pass on either side of his mount. Kelsey veered to the side at the last moment, trying to put them both on his right, but the monkeys were just as quick, and turned accordingly. Undaunted, the elf lifted his sword up and over to the left, angling for that beast. Predictably, the frightened thing opened its wings for drag and fell back, and Kelsey\u0027s blade whipped across to the right, deflecting a diving claw and severing half the monkey\u0027s foot. Kelsey knew instinctively that the one to the left was diving for him, had him vulnerable, so he continued to the right, falling all the way over the side of the horse. The monkey\u0027s hooked claws caught nothing but air. Kelsey did not fall from his seat, as had Gary. The Tylwyth Teg were said to be the finest riders in all of Faerie, and Kelsey did not diminish that reputation in the least. Right under his steed\u0027s belly, between the pumping legs, he rolled, tugging himself back up the other side, and tugging tight to the bridle, rearing his mount. He had won the first pass, but the monkeys were coming back the other way for the second. Kelsey kicked his mount into a charge, happy to oblige. Again, the monkeys tried to flank him, one on either side, and this time, Kelsey went right through the gauntlet, his sword snapping left, right, and left again, so quickly that he took only a minor nick on his forearm. He was better prepared, his cunning warrior mind working fast, as he brought the mount around for the third pass, this time turning before the monkeys had even come about. Down the middle, Kelsey started again, but then he lifted one leg over his horse\u0027s back, standing at the side of the charging beast, using the horse\u0027s body as a shield between him and the monkey on the right. Again, Kelsey perfectly anticipated his opponents\u0027 reactions. The monkey on the left swerved wide, having no desire to face the elf head-on, and the one to the right cut in for the horse, thinking the elf concerned with its companion. Kelsey started left, then jumped back across his horse\u0027s back, sword leading in a straightforward thrust. The weapon suddenly weighed an extra fifty pounds, exploding through the monkey\u0027s chest, but Kelsey managed to hold on to it, taking the skewered monkey along for the ride. He heard a shriek close behind, and knew that the monkey which had fled the pass had come around quickly. Lying sidelong across his running horse\u0027s back, his sword stuck fast in a dead enemy, Kelsey was not in an enviable position. With few options, the elf heaved the dead monkey out behind him. It slipped free of the blade, right into its flying companion\u0027s path, and the charging monkey had to kick off from the body, its momentum stolen by the ploy. By the time the living monkey recovered, recovered, too, was Kelsey. He turned his horse about once more and began yet another charge. Alone, the monkey wanted no part of the elf, and its wings beat furiously, trying to get it out of harm\u0027s way. Kelsey\u0027s sword slashed its wing, and its flight became an awkward flutter. It swooped and rose, turned sideways and rolled right over in midair, finally fluttering down to the ground. The frightened monkey ran on, but it was no match for the speed of Kelsey\u0027s powerful mount. The horse ran it down, monkey bones crackling under the pounding hooves. The monkey lay in the dirt and dust, its backbone shattered, and watched helplessly, dying, as Kelsey turned his steed once more. But Kelsey had no time to finish the unfortunate beast. He looked back to the road, saw Gary\u0027s horse trotting, suddenly without a rider, and saw the gnome on his curious contraption rolling fast into a snapping and slashing tangle of nearly a dozen monsters. And Kelsey\u0027s bow lay on the ground many yards away. Gary had saved Gerbil, but the gnome realized that the reprieve would not last for long. A handful of monkeys still pursued him, and several others, the band that had rushed past Gary Leger, were now coming at him from the other direction. \"Drat\u0027n\u0027doggonit, drat\u0027n\u0027doggonit!\" the gnome cried, his little legs pumping the pedals furiously, and his hand working the jammed umbrella lever. \"Not to be pretty,\" Mickey McMickey, watching from some distance away, muttered. It appeared as a strange game of \"chicken,\" with Gerbil leading one band of monkeys at top speed one way, and a larger band flying fast the other. Monkeys shrieked, Gerbil screamed, and at the last instant before the collision the gnome grabbed the steering bar in both hands, jerked it sharply one way and then back the other, sending the quadricycle into a spin, its skidding wheels shooting a swirling cloud of dust into the air. Gerbil yanked yet another lever as the groups came crashing together, this one dropping his seat flat, getting him down as low as he could go between the contraption\u0027s high wheels. Monkeys smashed together, smashed into the quadricycle, and slammed against poor Gerbil. The whole of the group seemed to hang motionless - a communal stun, it seemed - and then the quadricycle rolled slowly out the side of the group. The monkeys, beginning to recover, hat the gnome helpless. Nets flew up from the road, flying in at the throng Monkeys shrieked and scrambled and would have batterec each other into complete chaos, but Mickey, his powers a a low ebb, couldn\u0027t hold the illusion and the nets dissipated. More real were the arrows that suddenly flew in, anc the hammers that came spinning from the other side. Th\u003c gnome was helpless, unconscious actually, but not so help less was the grim-faced elf, rushing in on his shining whitf steed, or the running dwarf, laughing wildly, his little leg! rolling under him, his arms heaving hammer after hammer One of Geno\u0027s hammers and one of Kelsey\u0027s arrows go the large leader of the group at the same time, blasting it; breath from its lungs and then turning that burst of breatl into a whistling gurgle through a neat hole in its neck. Those monkeys that could still fly did so, and seven o the nine got away, the other two falling prey to Kelsey\u0027. bow. The three living monkeys on the ground joined to gether in a unified defense against the charging dwarf .. and were summarily buried where they stood.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dragon-s-dagger-spearwielder-s-tale-2/page-9.html","bookId":2185,"book":{"id":2185,"title":"The Dragon\u0027s Dagger (Spearwielder\u0027s Tale #2)","description":"Storyline: The Dragon\u0027s Dagger (Spearwielder\u0027s Tale #2) The sequel to The Woods Out Back.
