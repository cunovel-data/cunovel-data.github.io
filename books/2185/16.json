{"id":100154,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"Gary finally righted his helm enough so that he could see, but with the dizzying blur of the broken landscape rolling beneath, he almost wished he hadn\u0027t. Stifling a scream, the young man who wished he had taken some riding lessons tucked the magical spear tightly under his arm and held on for all his life. His horse leaped across shallow ravines, zigzagged through boulder-strewn fields, and splashed across several small streams. Gary sensed that enemy soldiers were about, even saw one group, resting under a widespread tree at the base of a hillock, eating a meal. One of them noticed Gary as well, pointed and called out.\n But Gary was a white blur, a trick of the eyes, gone from sight before the other soldiers even reacted to the cry.\n Still, the young man knew that he was vulnerable, and if the clopping of hooves, the rattle of armor plates, and the occasional snort from the fiery horse weren\u0027t enough, the elfish bells began to ring!\n I didn\u0027t command them to do that! Gary thought, trying to sort out what in the world was happening to him. He hadn\u0027t thought about the bells at all, actually, and yet they were ringing. He couldn\u0027t control the horse, couldn\u0027t control the bells, and that led him to the inevitable conclusion that someone else had taken command of everything around him.\n Gary Leger had met the witch Ceridwen on his last journey through Faerie; he figured that he knew who that someone else might be.\n He had to jump off. As terrifying as that thought seemed, Gary believed that he had no practical choice. It had to be Ceridwen, after all, and Gary figured that anything would be better than meeting her again. Jumping was easier thought than done, though, for the armor prevented Gary from making a clean leap, and the ground, turf-soft in some places but boulder-hard in others, promised to smash him apart.\n \"You have to do it,\" he whispered grimly to himself, and he forced himself to make the first move, to bring the spear out from his side so that he could toss it away from him as he went.\n Gary\u0027s arm jerked, but he found, to his disbelief and his horror, that his fingers would not let go.\n \"Do not throw me away, young sprout!\" came the mental command.\n Gary\u0027s thoughts rushed back in a jumbled blur, too fast for him to clearly spell out to the sentient spear what he believed was happening. He took a deep breath, forced himself to slow down at last, and pointedly imparted, / did not command the elfish bells to ring!\n \"I did,\" came the surprisingly calm response.\n Gary nearly fell out of the saddle; under his helm, his mouth drooped open. What the hell was going on?\n The horse bounded around another bend, leaped a low hedgerow, and padded to a quick stop, and Gary Leger had his answers.\n \"Restore my honor!\" the spear commanded.\n Gary was as surprised as the three men facing him across the way - two Connacht soldiers centered by the knight, Redarm.\n The surprisingly resilient quadricycle rolled away, Gerbil taking care to avoid the groaning forms of the fallen Con-nacht soldiers. Carefully, too, went Kelsey on his horse, leading the horse bearing Mickey and Cedric. The leprechaun had done his best in binding the wounded smithy, and Kelsey had helped as well, the elf, like all the Tylwyth Teg, being greatly versed in the healing arts. Gerbil had even added a potion and healing salve, from yet another compartment in his amazing vehicle. They had not been able to dig the arrowhead out of Cedric\u0027s chest, though, and despite the warm blankets they wrapped about the man, cold sweat continued to stream down his face.\n \"We won\u0027t catch Gary Leger tugging him along,\" Geno grumbled to Kelsey. Kelsey had no rebuttal, except to ask, \"Would you prefer that we leave the man behind?\"\n Geno thought that one over for a long while, even nodded a few times. \"Stonebubbles!\" he cursed at last, and he walked his pony out ahead of the slow-moving elf, taking the point position.\n Mickey took a deep draw on his long-stemmed pipe, feeling more helpless than he had ever before. The continued absence of his pot of gold, his source of magical energy, had depleted the leprechaun to the point where he practically hadn\u0027t been able to help out at all in the last fight. He called upon what little magical energy he had remaining now, though, imparting to the grievously wounded smithy images of a spreading chestnut tree, a hot forge, and glowing metal. Better for Cedric to rest easily with the thoughts that would most comfort him, Mickey figured, and he watched the man\u0027s muscled chest, expecting that each shallow breath would be Cedric\u0027s last.\n His face alone could frighten the heartiest of men. Redarm sat atop his great stallion, the hinged faceplate of his plated armor up high on his head. Despite his obvious delight at seeing Gary, his expression was grim, his skin ruddy and scarred in a dozen places. He wore a thick black moustache that covered both his lips when his mouth was closed, and his similarly thick eyebrows converged above the bridge of his oft-broken, crooked nose. Even from twenty yards, Gary could tell that Redarm\u0027s eyes were dark, black actually, and bloodshot. Angry eyes, Gary thought, always angry.\n The man forced a smile, a curiously evil sight. \"Geldion relegated me to the back lines,\" he said, a coarse chuckle accompanying his gravelly voice, \"in punishment for my obvious eagerness to kill you! And here, by the fates, do you come to play.\"\n Not so fateful, Gary thought grimly.\n \"Restore my honor,\" the spear commanded.\n Eat shit. The sentient spear had no response to that, seemed somewhat confused to Gary, and that gave him some pleasure - muted pleasure, of course, since the young man believed with all his heart that he was about to die. \"By Prince Geldion\u0027s word, this man from Bretaigne is to be taken alive,\" the soldier to Redarm\u0027s right reminded the knight, placing his hand over Redarm\u0027s wrist as the knight reached for the hilt of his sword. \"Geldion did say that,\" Redarm agreed calmly, and the soldier removed his hand. Redarm had the sword out in the blink of an eye and slashed across, smashing the cruel blade downward into the side of the man\u0027s neck, nearly decapitating him. The soldier sat very still in his saddle, his expression frozen. Then, as though the residual energy of the tremendous hit had rolled down to his feet and come storming back up, he seemed to leap out of his saddle, falling dead to the grass.\n The now-riderless horse nickered and pawed the ground in helpless protest.\n Redarm swung about the other way, but the remaining soldier had already kicked his horse into a run, fleeing with all speed.\n Gary looked on dumbfoundedly, felt his stomach churning and his pulse pounding in his temples. He had seen battle in Faerie, had even seen men cut down, but never so ruthlessly and never by another man.\n \"Now it is as it should be,\" the scarred knight said to Gary. Without even wiping away the blood, Redarm replaced his sword in its scabbard and took up his lance.\n \"Have you made your peace with whatever god you serve?\" the knight asked politely, and before Gary could stutter an answer, Redarm dropped his faceplate, set his lion-and-clover-emblazoned shield, and dipped his lance atop its concave-cut corner.\n What the hell do I do now? Gary asked the spear.\n \"Restore my honor!\"\n \"Will you say something else!\" Gary cried out, and Redarm straightened in his saddle, lifting his faceplate once more.\n \"What else is to be said?\" the knight asked confusedly. \"Prepare to die, Gary Leger of Bretaigne, impostor of Cedric Donigarten!\" Down came the faceplate, down dipped the lance.\n \"Son of a bitch,\" Gary groaned.\n \"You say the most curious of things,\" remarked the sentient spear. \"Eat shit,\" Gary told it again.\n \"Indeed,\" replied the spear, and Gary could sense that it was not happy. \"We will talk of that comment again, young sprout.\"\n At that moment, Gary Leger didn\u0027t think that he would get the chance to talk of anything ever again. He looked around, wondering where he might run, but remembered that the spear, and not he, was in control of his horse. He groaned again, realizing that he didn\u0027t even have a shield, and dipped the speartip Redann\u0027s way.\n \"No shield,\" Gary whispered to himself, thinking that he might bring that up to the knight, might at least get Redarm to relinquish the unfair advantage, might get the honorable knight to throw his own shield aside. Gary never got the chance to mention it, though, for his horse kicked away suddenly, and Redarm\u0027s did likewise, and the thunder of hooves and the jingling of elfish bells filled the air.\n It seemed to Gary a macabre game of chicken, a game of nerves as much as skill. He saw Redarm\u0027s approach, saw mostly the deadly tip of the knight\u0027s lance, lined perfectly with his breastplate. Gary tried to shift about, tried even to turn his horse more to the side, for the two mounts seemed as though they would collide head-on.\n All that Gary could do was hold on, though, and hold tight to the spear, bracing it against his hip. With only a few strides to go, Gary understood another disadvantage of jousting with a spear, however strongly magicked.\n Redarm\u0027s lance was at least three feet longer.\n Prince Geldion\u0027s force continued the pursuit long after the eastern militia had cleared the field. Duncan Drochit, Badenoch, and the dwarf Kervin had urged their forces on as fast as Geldion had urged his - the other way. The three leaders had no intention of battling Connacht\u0027s well-armed and well-trained army on an open field and had never planned to do so. They had come out to meet Geldion only to keep him from their towns, and to keep him distracted while the small party slipped around. Now they rode and ran with all speed, back into the foothills of rugged Dvergamal. Stragglers who could not keep up, or those who inadvertently turned down the wrong narrow trails and wound up blocked from further retreat, were mercilessly cut down.\n Kervin\u0027s dwarfs offered the only real resistance to the Connacht army. They had secretly dug trenches, carefully replacing the top turf so that Geldion\u0027s riders would not see the traps. They had rigged small rockslides in the lower hills, both to hinder and crush pursuing enemies and to block off some of the trails used by their fleeing allies. Half the dwarfish force, ten sturdy warriors, had crouched among a rocky outcropping at the lip of the wide field, and when Geldion\u0027s lead riders came rushing past, intent on those men in full flight, out they came, battleaxes and warhammers chopping, a hearty song on their lips. They died, all ten, in bloody heaps, but not until they had taken down four times their own number in enemy soldiers.\n And so the tumult died away on the wide field, the thunder of hooves, the flying mud, and shouts of battle and agony, rolling away to be swallowed up in the diminishing echoes of rugged Dvergamal. The field bore the scars, quick though the charge passed, with lines of broken, churned turf, and with its northeastern corner bloodied by more than three score casualties.\n The instant of impact, when the tip of Redarm\u0027s lance poked hard against Gary\u0027s chestplate, seemed to move in slow motion for the terrified young man. He felt the hard jab against his breast, saw the lance bend, its tip sliding to the side, to find a niche in the crease of his armor at the front of his shoulder.\n Gary felt himself being pushed back, knew that his mount would not slow, and could not break momentum or turn away fast enough to save him. On came relentless Redarm, driving hard, roaring in victory.\n The lance bowed and snapped, and suddenly the magical spear was the longer weapon. Its tip flared with energy as it battered Redarm\u0027s ornate shield, turning it around on the man\u0027s arm. Any lesser weapon would have been deflected, but Donigarten\u0027s spear was the mightiest in all the land, and was angry now, determined to win back its honor.\n Gary felt the magic throb up his arm, telepathically compelling him to keep the weapon level and keep his course straight, the horses passing barely six inches apart. Gary flinched, knowing that he would surely be hit again by the remaining portion of the lance. But again, it all happened in the span of an eye-blink, and Gary had no time to formulate any logical arguments against the sentient spear\u0027s demands. He watched through the slit in his helm, his green eyes widening in blank horror, as the spear fought through the blocking shield and dove for Redarm\u0027s chestplate. Metal armor curled up beneath its killing touch, tore apart and rolled inward as the spear bit at the knight\u0027s flesh hungrily, ate into the man\u0027s broad chest.\n Gary felt the crunch as the remaining portion of Redarm\u0027s lance slammed him in the belly, but there was no strength behind the blow, no strength left at all in his opponent.\n The spear continued its plunge, through the man\u0027s lung and spine, bloodied tip driving out his back.\n The horses passed and both men, connected by the spear, were jerked about to face each other. Gary felt as though his arm would be pulled from its socket, but he held on stubbornly, and was promptly yanked half out of his saddle, lying sidelong across his mount\u0027s bouncing rump. He hooked his free arm under the front of his saddle, watched as his helmet fell bouncing to the ground.\n Redarm, too, fell back, and tumbled off his horse altogether. Gary could not support the sudden weight and had not the strength to tear the imbedded spear from the dead man. He let go and tried to right himself instead, figured to turn his horse about and somehow retrieve the bloodied weapon. And all the while, black wings of guilt flapped around Gary\u0027s ears, told him what he had just done, made him look at the fallen, broken knight.\n Redarm lay on his side in a widening pool of blood, the spearshaft protruding from one end, its tip sticking out the other. He was not moving, would never move again, Gary knew.\n Gary winced in pain as he started to shift his weight closer to the center of his now-trotting mount. Both his shoulder and belly had been hit hard and he knew without looking that blue-black bruises were already widening in those areas. He could only hope that he was not bleeding under the armor.\n When he had found his balance, he caught the bridle again and slowed the horse even more. For the first time since the pass with Redarm, Gary managed to look ahead of him, to look where he was going.\n Two twelve-foot-tall giants, their legs as thick as the trunks of old oaks, their chest broad and strong, stood side by side, a few feet apart, holding a thick net between them and grinning stupidly through pointed and jagged greenish-yellow teeth.\n Gary knew them, had seen mountain trolls on his last journey through Faerie. He gave a yell, tried hard to turn his mount aside, but the surprisingly quick monsters shifted with him, and both he and his horse plunged headlong into the net.\n The powerful trolls were moved backwards no more than a single step by the impact, and they quickly wrapped their captured prey so tightly that Gary\u0027s terrified horse could not even continue to kick and thrash. Gary thought that he would surely be crushed in that pile. He strained to get his face out to the side so that he could at least try to draw breath.\n \"Horsie for supper,\" a third troll remarked happily, coming over to join its companions. He poked a huge and dirty finger into Gary\u0027s face. \"But none fer you!\" he laughed. \"No food fer you all the way!\"\n \"All the way?\" Gary whispered. This had not been a random stroke of bad luck, he knew then. Someone else, not Prince Geldion or even King Kinnemore, had guided these monsters, and Gary, already fearful of a certain witch, had little trouble in figuring out who it might be. He took some small comfort when the band started away, realizing that the trolls had been too stupid to even go over and retrieve the magical spear.\n Small comfort. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dragon-s-dagger-spearwielder-s-tale-2/page-16.html","bookId":2185,"book":{"id":2185,"title":"The Dragon\u0027s Dagger (Spearwielder\u0027s Tale #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Dragon\u0027s Dagger (Spearwielder\u0027s Tale #2) \n The sequel to The Woods Out Back.
