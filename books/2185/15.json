{"id":100153,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"\"Ride on!\" Kelsey commanded, starting down the side of the ridge behind the smithy Cedric, leading the group to flank the impending battle on the western side.\n Geno, alone among the companions, seemed hesitant, looking back to his left, back where his dwarfish comrades stood to face the overwhelming odds. His torment was obvious, and not unexpected to Kelsey, and the elf quickly reversed direction, sidestepping his mount around the rolling quadricycle and slapping Gary\u0027s pony on the rump as it trotted by. A few words to Geno, reminding the dwarf of the importance of the mission, brought Geno along, though many times did the beardless dwarf look back over his left shoulder.\n The field was lost from sight almost immediately as the companions went low in a gully. They heard the continuing thunder of pounding hooves, the cries of battle, the wails of the wounded and dying, but it seemed not nearly as intense as Gary had expected.\n \"Our allies are in flight back to the foothills,\" Mickey explained to him, seeing his quizzical look. \"That was the plan all along, to bait Geldion in and keep him running the opposite way from us.\"\n Gary looked back, using one hand to adjust the too-big helmet with his head as he turned. He heard shouts of frustration from Geldion\u0027s hungry force, confirmation of the leprechaun\u0027s claims, and was glad. The whole thought of the battle - especially with a greater common enemy, the dragon, free to terrorize the land - made bile rise in Gary\u0027s throat.\n Cedric was still leading the way, driving his horse hard along the gully, then into a perpendicular trail running straight west and even lower from the battlefield. They went around a hillock, turning back to the south, now with a wall of grass between them and Geldion\u0027s force, the cries and thunderous hooves fast fading into the background.\n It seemed not enough distance to the eager smithy, and he kicked his big boots against his mount\u0027s flank, spurring the horse full out as they rounded yet another bend, this one wrapping right behind the battlefield, back to the east.\n \"What ho, with ease good smithy!\" Kelsey warned. \"We have put them behind us.\" Gary understood where Kelsey\u0027s words were leading. The elf knew that Geldion\u0027s main force could not catch them, but he feared - and rightly so, Gary believed - that scouting parties, or groups held back to flank the enemy, had been deployed in the region.\n Around the bend went reckless Cedric, and his horse whinnied immediately and skidded to a stop in the soft turf. All the others broke stride as Cedric\u0027s horse backped-aled, the smithy yanking hard on the reins, trying not to fall backwards off the mount.\n Cedric reappeared fully from around the bend, a stunned expression on his bushy-bearded face and an arrow sticking from his chest.\n Kelsey, in full charge, fitted an arrow and ducked low, his mount galloping with all speed around the back of the wounded Cedric, using the smithy as a shield. As soon as he came clear on the other side, the elf let fly his .arrow, then dropped the bow across his saddle horn and drew out his gleaming sword.\n Geno, ever hungry for battle, charged right behind, and Gary followed. Gerbil skidded the quadricycle to a stop and pulled open a compartment to the side of his seat, removing a long metal pole, a crank, and two iron balls secured to either end of a four-foot length of hemp.\n Cedric was still up on the horse when Gary caught up to him, the smithy\u0027s mouth still wide with surprise, and his hands tight around the reins. Hardly thinking of the movement, Gary lifted Mickey across to the man\u0027s horse, yelled for the leprechaun to help him, and kicked his mount away, following Kelsey and Geno.\n Eight Connacht soldiers had been positioned in the gully, looking for potential flanking maneuvers from this very direction. That number was now seven, with one man slumped low in his saddle, face against his horse\u0027s mane, and an elfish arrow sticking diagonally into his collar. But the scouts, still twenty yards away and with bows in hand, had not been taken by surprise. A line of crimson appeared on Kelsey\u0027s neck as an arrow narrowly missed its deadly mark. Another bolt would have hit the elf squarely, except that Kelsey fell to the side and threw up his sword, luckily tipping the missile wide. Those same two bowmen were the closest foes for the elf, and he roared in, hoping to get to them before they were fully prepared for close melee.\n The hiss of metal on metal split the air as broadswords slipped free of their scabbards. One of the soldiers foolishly kicked his mount ahead, relinquishing the two-on-one advantage for the first attack routines. Kelsey\u0027s sword, blue-glowing with magical fires, slashed across as the horses came side by side, and the broadsword intercepted it and forced it wide. Quicker than the soldier believed possible, Kelsey let go the sword, flipped his hand around and caught its hilt with an upside-down grasp. He jabbed it back, daggerlike, into the man\u0027s knee.\n The soldier howled, his horse reared, and Kelsey, already going to the side, turned his mount further and called into its ear. The intelligent beast readily complied, lifting its haunches from the ground and kicking out with both hooves, blasting the wounded soldier from his saddle. Kelsey continued the turn, came around a full circle, moving behind the now-riderless horse to bide some time as the second soldier bore down on him, broadsword slashing through the air.\n Gary worked hard to catch up with Geno. The gully was not wide - just a few horses could fit side by side, and with Kelsey already in tight against the enemy, Gary knew that poor Geno would take the brunt of the remaining bow attacks. One arrow went wide, at least one other hit the charging dwarf with a popping thud. But Geno hardly seemed to flinch, bent low over the side of his pony, a hammer cocked and ready.\n It wasn\u0027t until he felt the smack against his chestplate that Gary Leger realized his error in focusing his attention on the fate of his diminutive friend. It took him many moments to get past the shock of being hit so that he could even realize that the arrow had splintered harmlessly against his fabulous armor, its stone tip barely scratching the marvelous suit. Still, the shock had broken Gary\u0027s momentum, had sent Geno rushing far out ahead of him.\n Gary looked up ahead and prodded his horse forward, but then reared his mount as another archer drew a bead on him and let fly.\n One soldier, the only knight among the group, lowered a long lance and charged out for the approaching dwarf. Geno straightened as though he meant to come across on the pass as if in joust. But the dwarf on his pony was barely half the height of the armored man on the tall black stallion. Geno had come to Gary\u0027s defense when the young man had tricked Redarm, and now the dwarf proved that he, too, would hot confuse stupidity with honor. The knight came thundering on, thinking to skewer the apparently helpless dwarf and charge past to the next rider. Before he ever got close, though, Geno\u0027s arm whipped out, one, two, and three, and a line of hammers twirled in low, clipping the front legs of the knight\u0027s horse.\n The beast stumbled with the first hit, began to pitch with the second, and the third only ensured that it was going down head first. The surprised knight did not react nearly quickly enough as the tip of his long lance dipped and then caught into the ground. The weapon\u0027s butt end slammed hard into the man\u0027s armpit, and he pitched forward in a fumbling pole-vault. He nearly went up vertically before the lance snapped, dropping him hard to the ground, where he lay, dazed and weighted by the heavy armor, and unable to crawl or even roll out of harm\u0027s way.\n Geno tightened his muscular legs around the pony\u0027s sides and forced the mount to veer sharply, hooves slamming atop metal plating, driving the wounded knight deeper into the soft turf.\n Another arrow hit the dwarf then, in the left shoulder, but Geno only growled and snapped his legs around the other way, making a tight turn towards the archer.\n The arrow tore a gash in his horse\u0027s ear, continued on to deflect off Gary\u0027s armored side, stinging him though it could not penetrate the enchanted metal.\n The man was already reaching for another bolt, and now eyeing Gary\u0027s horse dangerously.\n Gary knew that he couldn\u0027t give the archer that next shot, that the man would likely kill his mount and leave him sprawling helplessly in the grass. He had just seen Geno\u0027s maneuver, and the thought of being crunched under fifteen hundred pounds of horse and rider didn\u0027t seem overly appealing.\n Gary cocked the mighty spear over his shoulder and brought his arm forward as if to throw.\n \"Do not!\" screamed a voice in his head, and to his amazement, his fingers would not loosen from the black shaft.\n Gary\u0027s horse bolted away, apparently of its own accord, charging straight for the archer. Instinctively, Gary leveled the spear at his hip, while desperately clinging to the reins of the out-of-control beast. The archer\u0027s face paled. He fumbled with his arrow, then seemed to realize that he could not possibly ready the bow and fire in time. He threw the bow aside and grabbed at his swordhilt.\n Gary knew that he had the man dead.\n Dead!\n Gary Leger was about to kill a human being. His conscience screamed at him, his heart missed many beats, but his horse, nostrils flaring and head down in full charge, did not sway an inch.\n At the last moment, Gary flipped the balanced spear around in his hand. He nearly toppled off the side of his galloping mount for the effort, and clicked himself painfully in the shoulder with the mightily enchanted speartip. Somehow he managed to get the butt end of the spear out in front, though, and it cracked off his terrified opponent\u0027s raised forearm, blasted through as Gary\u0027s mount rushed by, and smacked full force into the man\u0027s chest, knocking him flat out on his back across his horse\u0027s rump.\n Gary heard him groan as he rushed past, was grateful for the sound, though he winced as he heard the man drop heavily to the ground. Gary\u0027s horse swung about sharply, unexpectedly, and Gary lurched in the saddle, rolling far to the side.\n \"Slow down!\" he called helplessly to the horse. He focused ahead just in time to see another archer, arrow nocked and eyes set on Gary, pull back on his bowstring.\n The horse jostled over an uneven patch of ground, and Gary\u0027s poor-fitting helmet dropped down over his eyes.\n \"Oh, God!\" he cried, thinking that he was about to die. Something slammed his forehead, dented his helm, and he saw little stars explode behind his eyelids.\n \"Oh, God!\" he said again, but he realized that he was still alive, still on his horse. He grabbed blindly across the mount\u0027s back and pulled himself as upright as he could, and spotted the archer under the top edge of his fallen helm, fast moving off to the side. Gary realized that he couldn\u0027t go by the man, couldn\u0027t give him any more clear shots. He fell over the other way, tugging hard on the reins. The horse apparently had the same idea, and turned more easily, and at a sharper angle, than Gary expected.\n And at a sharper angle than the archer had expected, Gary realized as he brought his forearm up to bat the troublesome helm so that the slit somewhat aligned with his eyes.\n \"Oh, God!\" Gary cried a third time, just as his horse rammed full force into the archer\u0027s.\n It wasn\u0027t pretty, it wasn\u0027t graceful, but somehow it proved effective as the enemy soldier and horse toppled sideways, the horse crushing the man\u0027s leg as they slammed down to the ground. Gary\u0027s agile mount quickstepped, bucked and hopped, among the tangle, and came out beyond, Gary still holding the reins and still holding the spear, though his helmet had flown completely around on his head.\n \"You do not fight to kill,\" the spear remarked - accused? - in Gary\u0027s mind. Thinking that the weapon was belittling him, Gary started to respond with a stream of silent curses.\n \"That is good, young sprout,\" the spear went on, ignoring the ranting man. \"You value life, even the lives of your enemies.\"\n Gary had no more time to pay attention to the telepathic barrage. More enemies remained, and he couldn\u0027t see them! \"But I\u0027ll not let you get killed,\" the sentient spear imparted. \"Not yet.\"\n The thought seemed curious to Gary, and he was too muddled and afraid to put two and two together when, an instant later, his mount cut a nasty turn (and again, Gary had to hold on for his life) and leaped away, running full out. Gary tried to get a hand free so that he could at least figure out where he was going. Not that he was sure he wanted to see ahead, for he feared that he would find another knight with a lowered lance, patiently waiting to skewer him.\n Just as he let go the reins with one hand, his horse leaped high and long, coming down with a jolt that forced Gary to grab on with both hands again. Grab on and tighten his legs about the steed\u0027s sides, lying low in the saddle all the while.\n It took Gary another long moment to discern that the sounds of battle were fast fading behind him, that he was running free and far away from enemies and friends alike.\n His first thoughts went to Ceridwen, the troublesome and dangerous witch. Had she taken control of the horse? Was she reeling Gary Leger in to her like an angler with a hooked fish?\n \"Help me!\" Gary cried, his shout ringing inside the helmet and inside his own ears. He yanked on the reins with all his strength, but the horse pulled back, kept its head low and flew on across the rolling fields. Kelsey and the swordsman continued their fight across the back of the riderless horse, the agile elf easily parrying the lunging attacks of the angry fighter. The elf would have liked to play this out longer, to take no chances against an opponent he could obviously defeat, but he heard Geno\u0027s arrow-inspired grunts and saw Gary Leger bolting about wildly, dangerously.\n The fighter gave a straight thrust across the horse\u0027s back, his sword diving for Kelsey\u0027s thigh.\n Confident in his mount, Kelsey let go the reins altogether and caught the man\u0027s wrist, shifting himself about and tugging hard, drawing the overbalanced man right across the riderless horse\u0027s back. The elf\u0027s sword was free, and his opponent was trapped and helpless.\n Surprisingly, to Kelsey, an image of Gary Leger came into his thoughts. The tip of Kelsey\u0027s blade was just an inch from the helpless, terrified man\u0027s exposed forehead when Kelsey turned it aside, sent it snapping into the man\u0027s biceps instead so that he cried out in pain and lost his grip on his own sword.\n Kelsey let go the wrist and grabbed the man by the hair, tugging him fiercely, pulling his face down towards the ground. His sword came in again, this time hilt-first, slamming the man on the base of his neck. The soldier struggled no more, went limp under Kelsey\u0027s grasp and slowly slid over the back of the riderless horse and fell to the ground. Kelsey took care not to trample the unconscious man, sidestepped his mount around the back of the riderless horse, and looked for his companions.\n He saw Geno, two arrows already sticking from the dwarf, charging the two remaining opponents, both archers, sitting composed, side by side, bows drawn and ready.\n \"Now you die, dwarf!\" one of them cried, as much in fear as in anger. A horn blast to the side - not the winding horn a knight might carry, but a curious beeping sound - turned all eyes. Gerbil\u0027s quadricycle rushed and bounced along the steep slope of the gully\u0027s side. One of the gnome\u0027s arms worked frantically on the contraption\u0027s steering bar, while the other pumped wildly on a crank, turning a high pole tipped by spinning bolas. Gerbil tried to watch the rough path ahead, while eyeing a sighting device attached to the pole. \"Oh, yes!\" the gnome cried, letting go the crank and flicking a trigger. The bolas flew free, spinning fiercely, looping about the nearest archer. The hemp wound fast, iron balls cracking the unfortunate man about the shoulders and pitching him sidelong into his similarly surprised companion.\n \"Oh, yes, yes!\" Gerbil shouted in victory, but he should have paid attention to his own precarious perch instead. The front left wheel of the quadricycle slammed against a rock and bounced up high, taking the whole side of the gnome\u0027s vehicle off the ground.\n Gerbil\u0027s victory shout turned to a shriek as he tried to hold the quadricycle steady on two wheels. He lost the valiant fight when his right front wheel plopped into a ditch and got yanked sidelong. Poor Gerbil and his contraption pitched head over heels, crunched down in the soft turf, and slid to a stop at the base of the gully\u0027s slope.\n Geno wasn\u0027t watching the gnome, more concerned with the tangle of enemy archers before him. The one who had been hit with the bolas went down hard between the horses, one shoulder obviously broken, wailing loudly and trying to keep his own horse from stepping on him. The other archer was still in the saddle, though, righting himself and trying to ready his bow. Sheer terror covered his face when he looked up to see the charging dwarf, face contorted in rage and a hammer high above his head.\n The archer fell backwards, fell away from the chopping hammer, as Geno\u0027s pony slammed in. Geno leaped right from his mount, dove forward into the leaning man and forced them both off the back side of the archer\u0027s horse. The man twisted about so that he did not land flat on his back and tried to break his fall with outstretched arms. One wrist exploded with a tremendous crack, and the surprising weight of the short but compact dwarf drove the man facedown into the turf.\n Geno grabbed a handful of hair and jerked the man\u0027s head back, then faceslammed him into the soft grass. Seeing a better target, the dwarf yanked him back again, shifted the angle slightly, and rammed him into a halfburied rock. The man\u0027s ensuing scream came out as a blood-filled gurgle. His nose and cheek shattered, but that only seemed to urge the ferocious dwarf on. Geno slammed him again, then hooked an arm under the man\u0027s shoulder and tugged so fiercely that he dislocated the arm. A dwarfish knee crunched the half-turned man\u0027s stomach, rolling him right over to his back, his arm garishly wrapped behind him.\n Geno was up to his feet in an instant, deadly hammer ready to do its grim work.\n \"Do not finish him,\" Kelsey advised, trotting his mount over. Both elf and dwarf looked around to see that, amazingly, not a single opponent had been killed, though the man whom Geno had trampled with the pony was grievously wounded.\n \"Go to the gnome,\" Kelsey ordered. The elf turned about to see Mickey steering Cedric\u0027s horse forward. The huge smithy sat very straight in the saddle, caked with sweat, his dark eyes unblinking.\n \"Whatever ye\u0027re to do, do it fast,\" Mickey advised, and he looked to poor Cedric, then back to Kelsey, shaking his head. The man on the ground flopped about, jostling Geno, and the dwarf\u0027s hammer came up in an instant.\n \"Geno,\" Kelsey said slowly.\n \"Bah, good enough for you!\" the dwarf yelled at his wounded victim, and he followed the growl with a stream of spittle, then stomped off to extract the fallen gnome.\n Kelsey looked around, was somewhat relieved to see that no other enemies were in the area. But neither was Gary Leger.\n \"Where* d the lad run off to?\" Mickey asked.\n Kelsey shook his head, having no answers.\n \"There\u0027s suren to be other enemies about,\" Mickey remarked.\n Again, Kelsey had no answer for the leprechaun. He, too, was concerned for Gary, and he was concerned for himself and the others as well, for Cedric seemed to be hovering near death, and Gerbil and his gnomish contraption had gone down hard. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dragon-s-dagger-spearwielder-s-tale-2/page-15.html","bookId":2185,"book":{"id":2185,"title":"The Dragon\u0027s Dagger (Spearwielder\u0027s Tale #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Dragon\u0027s Dagger (Spearwielder\u0027s Tale #2) \n The sequel to The Woods Out Back.
