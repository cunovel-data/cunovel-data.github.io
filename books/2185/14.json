{"id":100152,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"The companions caught up with the ragtag militia of Drochit and Braemar a few hours later, on the high edge of a field looking down across the rolling hills to the west and south. Despite Geno\u0027s assurances concerning what his dwarfish kinfolk had told him, Kelsey kept the companions outside the ring of farmer-soldiers, unsure of where the lines of alliances had been drawn. By all reports and all previous actions, Duncan Drochit and Lord Badenoch would seem to be friends, but in these confusing and dangerous times, and with so much hanging on the success of their quest, the friends had to exercise all caution.\\n\\n The sentries within the camp, too, seemed unsure, eyeing the riders with some concern and clutching tightly to their pitchforks and axes. Finally, a contingent of dwarfs came marching out of the rocky foothills, and Geno, Kelsey, and Gerbil fell into step beside them, going with them to meet the militia leaders.\\n\\n \"They\u0027ll have no trouble,\" Mickey assured Gary, and Baron Pwyll, whose fate seemed to hang so precariously in the balance. \"We\u0027re all looking for the same thing, to stop the dragon and Connacht.\"\\n\\n \"Unless Badenoch and Drochit think it safer to hand me over to Prince Geldion,\" Baron Pwyll said gloomily, but there was a trace of accepting resignation in the large man\u0027s tone that Gary had not noticed before. \"They won\u0027t hand you over,\" Gary said firmly, to comfort the troubled man.\\n\\n \"Ye should have more the faith in yer friends,\" Mickey added. \"How many times have both Badenoch and Drochit looked to yerself with support, mostly in matters concerning the witch-backed throne?\"\\n\\n Pwyll nodded, but the grim expression did not leave his round face.\\n\\n \"Perhaps we would all be better off if I just surrender to Prince Geldion when he arrives,\" the Baron said with unexpected altruism.\\n\\n \"Better for all?\" Mickey quipped. \"Not so much better for yerself, unless ye\u0027re fancying hemp collars.\"\\n\\n Pwyll shrugged, but his mounting determination did not seem to ebb. It appeared to Gary as though the man was fighting an inner battle, conscience against cowardice, mustering his courage and looking beyond his own needs, even his own survival. Pwyll was formulating his own secret agenda, Gary knew, one that might well send him running to Geldion.\\n\\n \"Besides,\" Mickey quickly put in, apparently beginning to understand things the same way as Gary, \"Geldion\u0027s not really looking for yerself.\" Both men cocked curious eyebrows Mickey\u0027s way. \"For the spear and armor?\" Gary asked. \"That\u0027s a part of it, by me guess,\" Mickey replied, eyeing Gary directly and grimly. \"But he\u0027s wanting yerself, lad, and that we cannot let him get.\"\\n\\n Gary was about to ask what in hell Prince Geldion might want with him, but he thought things through silently instead, remembered from where the King, and thus the Prince, was being directed. Beautiful, raven-haired Ceridwen was the power behind Faerie\u0027s throne, and Gary was the one who had put a spear through the witch\u0027s belly, had banished her to her island home for a hundred years.\\n\\n It was not a comforting notion, and hung heavily in Gary\u0027s thoughts for the rest of that day, even after a group of men rode out from the encampment and bade the three companions to come in.\\n\\n Baron Pwyll was immediately summoned to join the conference with Kelsey, Badenoch, and Drochit. Seeming more assured than before, the big man squared his shoulders and walked with a confident stride.\\n\\n \"He was thinking of surrendering to Geldion,\" Gary remarked to Mickey, though he realized that the leprechaun had already figured that much out. \"That one\u00271l surprise ye,\" Mickey replied. \"Pwyll, above all the other lords, has held out against Kinnemore. Just the fact that Geldion\u0027s taking the trouble to come out after him shows Pwyll\u0027s strength.\"\\n\\n Gary nodded, but had a hard time reconciling what he knew about the fat Baron - particularly how Pwyll seemed to spend more time trembling than anything else - against the obvious respect the man commanded from friends and enemies alike. The guards standing on opposite sides of the command tent, wherein Kelsey was meeting with the two lords, beamed happily at the sight of Pwyll, as though their salvation was at hand, and straightened their posture as he passed between them.\\n\\n Gary sighed, and figured that Pwyll must have been something more spectacular when he was a younger man. He looked to Mickey again, and found the leprechaun walking away, towards a small cook-fire where Gerbil, Geno, and a few other dwarfs were gathered.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the matter with the little one?\" Gary heard Mickey ask as he rushed to catch up with the sprite. One look at Gerbil, head down and a pained expression upon his normally cheery expression, told Gary where that question had come from.\\n\\n \"Word has spread of casualties from the dragon attack on Gondabuggan,\" Geno informed them. The beardless dwarf gave a surprisingly sympathetic look Gerbil\u0027s way, then piped in heartily, \"The gnomes beat him off, though! Sent Robert fleeing to the mountains to lick grievous wounds.\" Geno reached over and gave Gerbil a swat on the back, but the gnome did not visibly react.\\n\\n \"But not without cost,\" another dwarf, one with a blue beard tucked into a wide, jeweled belt with a golden buckle, added. \"An entire section of the town was destroyed and a fair number of gnomes killed. And it is said that Robert came back, but did not go into the town.\"\\n\\n \"A gnome patrol is missing in the foothills,\" Geno added. \"Along with one of my own kin.\"\\n\\n Pangs of guilt turned Gary\u0027s stomach. He had been part of the group that had gone to Robert\u0027s lair, an act that had apparently coaxed the dragon out. And Gary had been the one to banish Ceridwen, a good thing by one way of thinking, but the act that had upset the balance, had given Robert the Wretched the confidence to fly free so far from his mountain home. Gary had found that he liked Gerbil, and if Gerbil was typical of his race, as Mickey had said, then the loss to Gondabuggan was surely a loss to all the world.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re going to send us around the fighting, if there is to be any fighting,\" Geno remarked, pointedly changing the subject. \"If Geldion blocks the way, then we are to go around while Badenoch and Drochit hold him at bay.\"\\n\\n Mickey nodded, apparently in agreement, but something discordant tugged hard at Gary\u0027s sensibilities.\\n\\n \"We all want the same thing,\" the young man replied angrily. \"How can we think about battling the Prince with the dragon soaring about? Why don\u0027t we all just band together against the dragon, then worry about our personal feuds?\"\\n\\n There came no immediate response, the simple logic of Gary\u0027s words seeming to steal the words from Geno and Mickey and all the others. At first, Gary took this to mean that he might be on to something, but he soon came to realize that he simply did not understand the depth of the budding feud between Connacht and the outlying baronies.\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s going on to the dragon?\" Mickey asked Geno.\\n\\n \"Same as before,\" the dwarf replied. \"Though we might bring a few of my kinfolk along, and Pwyll might be asked to stay behind.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027d hate that,\" Gary remarked sarcastically.\\n\\n \"And the little one,\" Geno went on, patting Gerbil again. \"His path is his own to choose. He might want to get back to Gondabuggan and help with the repairs.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Gerbil said resolutely, lifting his head so that the others could see the determination in his inquisitive eyes. \"No, no! I go to sting the dragon\u0027s home, I do, just as he attacked my own! Be afraid, wretched wyrm!\" the gnome proclaimed loudly. \"Oh, do, if you are half as smart as the legends say. You have never had an angry gnome in your nest, I would guess, and when you do, you will not be so happy a wyrm!\"\\n\\n Gary was just coming to terms with Geno\u0027s unexpectedly sympathetic posture when Gerbil launched his uncharacteristic tirade. He stared at the suddenly fierce gnome incredulously, then to Geno and the other dwarfs, lifting their mugs in a toast Gerbil\u0027s way.\\n\\n \"Slow to anger, but fierce as a badger when they do,\" Mickey whispered to Gary, referring to Gerbil and the race of gnomes in general. Gary did not argue; standing there, one foot up on a log, his head tilted back proudly, Gerbil seemed almost four feet tall.\\n\\n Geno was the only dwarf accompanying Kelsey, Gary, Mickey, and Gerbil as they walked their mounts (and Gerbil pumped his quadricycle) to a ridge above and to the side of the field where the opposing forces would meet. Kelsey and Geno moved behind a brush line overlooking the field, while Gary, with Mickey tucked in front of him, stayed back, and Gerbil found a level and out-of-the-way place to park his rolling contraption. With all that was happening, politically and militarily, the village leaders had decided that speed and stealth would be absolutely necessary if the small group was to have any chance of getting through to the Giant\u0027s Thumb to replace the stolen dagger. Thus, Badenoch, Drochit, Pwyll, and Kervin of the dwarfs had determined that the other dwarfs would not accompany the band, that the responsibility fell upon the shoulders of those who had taken the dagger, and upon Gerbil, who insisted that he be allowed to go along. Surly Geno, hoping for a little dwarfish companionship on the hard road, hadn\u0027t stopped grumbling since. Neither would Baron Pwyll accompany the friends, for Lords Badenoch and Drochit had begged the man to remain with them (right before Pwyll had begun to beg to be allowed to remain with them), to lend support and wisdom as they tried to fend off Connacht\u0027s encroachments from one side, and Robert\u0027s impending appearance from the other. That left one Tir na n\u0027Og horse free, Gary noted. He was about to ask about that, wondering if they should perhaps take the mount along as an extra, when he got his answer. Up padded the proud horse, bearing a short but stout and heavily muscled man with an impossibly thick black beard and tanned arms the size of Gary\u0027s thighs. He wore a sleeveless jerkin and simple breeches (that were too small for him), and carried an immense hammer over one shoulder. His skin was darkly tanned and seemed darker still, with patches of soot ground in against the brown flesh. His beard and thick-cropped hair were matted with the dirt and sweat of hard labors.\\n\\n \"Well met,\" Kelsey called to him, apparently expecting the ally. Geno and Mickey greeted the man as well, though Gerbil seemed too consumed by his private thoughts to even recognize that another had joined them.\\n\\n The huge man started for the ridge, then noticed Gary and gave a fierce tug that promptly wheeled his horse about, aiming it straight for the armored man. \"Cedric,\" he said, extending a calloused hand Gary\u0027s way and flashing a huge, broken-toothed smile.\\n\\n \"Cedric?\" Gary echoed.\\n\\n \"Cedric the smithy,\" the man replied. \"Best shoer in the world.\"\\n\\n \"Gary Leger,\" Gary replied, and he was nearly pulled from his saddle when the man grabbed his extended hand and pumped it vigorously.\\n\\n \"An honor, spearwielder,\" the man growled, and Gary was surprised by the obvious admiration in his tone. The smithy let go - Gary unconsciously wiped his now-grimy hand on his side - and jerked his horse about roughly. He nodded once more to Gary before padding up towards the crest of the ridge to join Kelsey and Geno.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re to meet in the field,\" Cedric explained loudly, and then Gary could make out no more as the powerful smithy moved in close to the others.\\n\\n \"Cedric?\" Gary asked Mickey.\\n\\n \"All the smithys - the human smithys - are named Cedric,\" the leprechaun explained. \"In honor of Donigarten. Ye couldn\u0027t find an ally more loyal, lad. Ye\u0027re carrying the spear and wearing the suit of the man\u0027s idol. That\u0027s why he was given the extra horse. Cedric\u0027ll die for ye, die for the spearwielder, smiling all the while if he thinks he\u0027s helped yer noble cause.\"\\n\\n It sounded crazy to Gary Leger, and he wasn\u0027t so sure that he liked having a man so willing to die for him. He started to mention that fact to Mickey, but changed his mind, suddenly realizing those thoughts as condescending. Who was he to determine another man\u0027s motivations? If Cedric the smithy would die smiling for the noble cause, then Cedric was a noble man, and Gary was the fool if he confused that sense of honor with foolishness.\\n\\n \"A good thing to have him along,\" Mickey remarked, and Gary nodded sincerely.\\n\\n They saw Kelsey\u0027s arm jerk out suddenly, pointing to the field below, and Mickey bade Gary to walk the horse over so that they might see the arrival of Geldion.\\n\\n The Prince came in from the southeast, the soldiers of Connacht arrayed behind him in the even lines of a well-trained army. Geldion rode out from the ranks on a black horse, flanked by three soldiers on either side. Redarm was not among this guard, Gary noted, and nowhere to be seen among the front ranks of Connacht soldiers, though what that might mean the young man could not discern.\\n\\n Gary focused his attention on the Prince instead. Geldion looked far from regal, looked almost haggard, actually, his skin too browned from the long road and pulled tight to his bones. He wore his worn brown traveling cloak, tied only at the neck, and a suit of armor that had seen many, many encounters. Jeweled scabbards at his side held sword and dagger, though, and Mickey assured Gary that Geldion was well versed in the use of both weapons.\\n\\n In response to Geldion\u0027s bold approach, Badenoch and Duncan Drochit trotted their mounts out from their ragtag force, Kervin the dwarfish leader running along beside them.\\n\\n \"Well met, Prince Geldion,\" the friends heard Badenoch call. The wind was behind the Lord, blowing in the faces of the hiding companions, and they heard the words clearly. \"Glad are we that Connacht came to us in our time of need,\" Badenoch went on, \"for mighty Robert has taken wing and threatens all the land!\"\\n\\n Geldion rocked back in his saddle; he seemed a bit surprised to Gary. \"Will you and your forces ride to Braemar beside us?\" Badenoch continued, his tone anything but hostile.\\n\\n \"Is Geldion to become an ally?\" Gary whispered to Mickey. For a moment, the young man thought that his earlier words might prove true, that these supposed enemies would band together against a common foe more powerful than either of them separately.\\n\\n \"Badenoch uses diplomacy to force Geldion to move first,\" Kelsey explained grimly, and Gary was somewhat surprised, and certainly pleased, that the elf was apparently talking to him again. \"The lords feign friendship so that Geldion will have no excuse to attack.\"\\n\\n Prince Geldion sat atop his mount, eyeing the lords suspiciously. His father had told him of the conspiracy, had even hinted that outlawed magic was being used to bring the lesser towns into line against Connacht. The thought did not sit well with the Prince of Faerie. Geldion was an extension of Kinnemore\u0027s throne, the most loyal of sons, but a part of him had been thrilled, and not so angry, when the ancient spear of Faerie\u0027s greatest hero had been re-forged. His father, though, had been purely outraged, a fact that bothered and confused Geldion more than a little.\\n\\n That confusion would not deter him from executing the duties Kinnemore had given to him. Not at all. Geldion would not let this Gary Leger of Bretaigne steal the repaired spear away, even if he had to kill the man personally!\\n\\n \"We may ride to Braemar,\" he replied in his shrill voice. \"But not for any defense against Robert. The dragon is only one of our concerns, and not the most immediate one.\"\\n\\n \"Surely the dragon ...\" Badenoch began, but the always impatient Prince cut him short.\\n\\n \"I demand the return of the outlaw, Pwyll, and the stolen artifacts!\" Geldion explained. \"And there is a young man, a Gary Leger from Bretaigne, a spy from beyond Cancarron Mountains, who desires to bring the precious items back to his homeland.\"\\n\\n \"Now, that\u0027d be a trick,\" Mickey remarked quietly, seeming not at all surprised by the lie. \"Where the hell is this Bretaigne place?\" Gary asked him. \"Beyond Cancarron Mountains,\" came the predictable answer, which told Gary, who had no idea of where the Cancarron Mountains might be, absolutely nothing.\\n\\n \"Are you so certain of his intent?\" Badenoch asked. \"Was it not Gary Leger who accompanied Kelsenellenelvi-al Gil-Ravadry .. .\"\\n\\n \"Well said!\" Mickey exclaimed, and he winked at Gary. \"He got that damned name right.\" The leprechaun\u0027s smirk drew a glare from Kelsey.\\n\\n \"... to Robert\u0027s lair to reforge the spear?\" Gary heard as Badenoch continued. \"Was it not Gary Leger who banished evil Ceridwen to her island fortress?\"\\n\\n \"All by himself,\" Geno muttered sarcastically. \"Well done, young sprout,\" came the telepathic call in Gary\u0027s head.\\n\\n Badenoch\u0027s last comment forced a visible wince from the haggard Prince, a wince that none of the friends on the not-too-distant ridge, and none of the three leaders facing Geldion, missed.\\n\\n \"Reforging the spear increased its value to Bretaigne,\" Geldion argued. \"As for any fights with Ceridwen, they were merely incidental, and not looked for by any of the traitors.\"\\n\\n \"True enough, except for the \u0027traitors\u0027 part,\" Mickey put in dryly. \"Connacht seems eager to brand traitors,\" Badenoch replied. \"Hold yer breath, lad,\" Mickey remarked at hearing the firm response, and even Geno gulped in some air.\\n\\n Geldion verily shook from boiling rage, his anger fueled by confusion. This was not how the kingdom was supposed to respond! His father was King, after all, the rightful King. How dare these lessers speak ill of Connacht! \"You seem eager to place yourself among that list!\" he snapped at Badenoch. \"I demand the return of the traitors, and of the stolen artifacts!\"\\n\\n Cool Badenoch, sitting tall on his proud stallion, his neatly cropped salt-and-pepper hair blown across his face from the breeze off the mountains, slowly glanced around from one side to the other, then looked directly at the opposing Prince.\\n\\n \"We do not have them,\" he answered calmly.\\n\\n Geldion wheeled his black horse about, jostling a couple of his escorts, and galloped back to the Connacht line.\\n\\n \"Hold yer breath, lad,\" Mickey said again.\\n\\n \"The bells must not ring,\" Kelsey said to the others, turning his mount away from the bushes and walking the horse down to the side of the ridge. Geno and Cedric followed immediately, and Gerbil pumped his quadricycle into position right beside the group.\\n\\n Gary waited a moment longer, though, sensing that the storm was about to break and unable to tear his gaze from the field.\\n\\n Geldion took a position in the center of the front rank. He stared across the field, his features grimly set, his right arm upraised. Badenoch, Drochit, and Kervin had not returned to their force; they sat far out from the lines, talking easily, and this seemed to upset Geldion all the more. Gary could hardly believe their courage, and understood that their apparent indifference to the coming storm was merely to give the unmistakable appearance to all witnesses, even the Connacht soldiers, that it was Geldion and the throne, and not the eastern villages, who precipitated this battle.\\n\\n Whatever the appearance, Prince Geldion would not be deterred. He moved as if he meant to call out again to the opposing leaders, probably to speak the accusation one final time, but the first word came out as a growl and Geldion just snapped his arm down to his side.\\n\\n Gary nearly jumped out of his seat, so surprised was he by the sudden thunder, the shaking of the ground beneath him, and the roar of a unified battle-cry, as five hundred horses and five hundred soldiers charged to battle.\\n\\n Prince Geldion sat very still in his saddle, letting his soldiers flow out around him in their wild charge across the field. \"So be it,\" Geldion muttered grimly. \"So be it.\"\\n\\n The three leaders in the field were not surprised in the least, though. They wheeled about and started off, Kervin accepting Drochit\u0027s extended hand and half climbing to the side of the horse, flying with all speed for their own ranks. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dragon-s-dagger-spearwielder-s-tale-2/page-14.html","bookId":2185,"book":{"id":2185,"title":"The Dragon\u0027s Dagger (Spearwielder\u0027s Tale #2)","description":"Storyline: The Dragon\u0027s Dagger (Spearwielder\u0027s Tale #2) \\n The sequel to The Woods Out Back.
