{"id":100148,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"The huge red-bearded man walked slowly down the rocky mountain trail, great sword resting easily over one shoulder. Below him, nestled beneath the veil of rising mist in the secluded mountain dell, lay the quiet town of Gondabuggan. Robert\u0027s hand clenched tightly about his swordhilt. He hated being in the confining human form, wanted to be out soaring on the high winds, feeling the freedom and feeling the strength of dragonkind. But Robert had lived many centuries and was as wise as he was strong. He suspected that the resourceful gnomes had sent word of his coming, figured that the tough dwarfs in the mountains and the puny humans across the towering range were well into their preparations to battle him. Even with the euphoric knowledge that the witch, Ceridwen, his principal rival, had been banished to her island, Robert would not forget due caution. If he were to rule the land, he would have to do it one village at a time, and Gondabuggan had the misfortune of being the closest settlement to the wyrm\u0027s lair. Though he was in human form, Robert retained the keen senses of dragonkind, and he sniffed the gnomish sentries, and a different scent that he had not expected, long before they suspected that he was anywhere about. He moved to a rocky outcropping, some fifty feet from the gnomes, and perked up his ears, hearing their every word. \"Kinnemore\u0027s army is on the field, by one report,\" said a dwarfish voice. \"It is truly amazing,\" replied an excited gnome. \"Truly amazing!\" \"Of course the meddlesome king is involved!\" the dwarf replied. \"The spear and armor of Donigarten have been stolen, by the elf who defeated Robert (with the help of Geno Hammerthrower, of course) and the hero of Bretaigne. Kinnemore is nervous, and all the land is in chaos.\" \"Truly amazing,\" the gnome said again. \"To think that Gerbil Hamsmacker simply flew through the mountains! Truly amazing!\" \"Oh, he will go down in gnomish records,\" another gnome agreed, clapping pudgy hands together. The exasperated dwarf groaned. \"The artifacts and the king\u0027s army are more important!\" he tried to explain. \"Yes,\" agreed a booming, resonant voice as a huge and muscled red-haired, red-bearded man stepped into view. \"Do tell me about the artifacts and the king\u0027s army.\" An hour later, Robert was a dragon again, gliding easily on the warm updrafts rising from the cliffs on the eastern edge of Dvergamal, waiting for his meal of two gnomes and a dwarf to settle - dwarfs had always been so indigestible! The news of events in the west had saved Gondabug-gan, for the time being, for Robert now understood that there was more about all of this than his being free and Ceridwen\u0027s being banished. Robert knew as well as any that Kinnemore was Ceridwen\u0027s puppet, and that, guided by the witch, the king would certainly cause him trouble. And there were heroes in the land now, for the first time in centuries, for the first time since the days of Cedric Donigarten. Dragons, whose power was as much a fact of intimidation as actual strength, did not like heroes. Gondabuggan would have to wait. Gerbil opened bleary eyes to see the sculpted features of a goldenhaired, golden-eyed elf looking back at him. A leprechaun sat on the front right wheel of Gerbil\u0027s quadri-cycle, puffing on a long-stemmed pipe and saying, \"Hmmm,\" repeatedly as he studied the gnome. Gerbil quickly straightened himself in his seat, tried to put on his best greet-the-visitors face. \"Gerbil Hamsmacker of Gondabuggan at your service,\" he said as politely as could be, and indeed, Gerbil meant every word to this troupe that had rescued him from certain doom. \"I pray that none of your most helpful party was too badly injured.\" \"The laddie, there, got a few lumps, is all,\" Mickey answered, motioning to Gary, who was kneeling in the road while Geno and Baron Pwyll tried to hammer a fair-sized dent out of one shoulder plate. \"The armor,\" Gerbil breathed under his breath, his gnomish eyes, typically blue, shining brightly and his head bobbing as if it all suddenly made sense to him. \"Oh, I do say that I thought Sir Cedric himself had come a\u0027bobbing to my rescue! Of course, of course, I do know better than that. Humans do not live so long, and Cedric ...\" \"Of course,\" Mickey replied. \"But I\u0027m agreeing that the lad has come to wear the armor well.\" \"Yes, yes,\" Gerbil said excitedly. \"That is why I came west, you know, because the word is spread that the armor and spear were missing ... stolen, actually.\" \"What concern would that be to a gnome of Gondabuggan?\" Kelsey asked gravely. \"None and lots,\" Gerbil answered. \"You see, Robert the Wretched was the one who reforged the spear.\" Kelsey and Mickey looked to each other and seemed not to understand the connection, at least not as far as Gondabuggan was concerned. \"Well, the missing spear and armor might offer some clues as to why Robert has come out on wing, so to speak,\" Gerbil explained at length. \"The two events were too closely related ...\" \"What do you know of the dragon?\" Kelsey interrupted, his voice stern. Kelsey knew, as did most of Faerie\u0027s folks, that a gnome could ramble for hours if not properly guided through a discussion, and from what Gerbil had just referred to, Kelsey wasn\u0027t certain that he had hours to spare. \"What do I know?\" Gerbil balked. \"Indeed, what do I? Of course, that depends mostly on the subject matter. Take explosives, for instance ...\" \"About the dragon,\" Kelsey clarified. \"He was over Gondabuggan, that is what I know!\" Gerbil said. \"Just ...\" He paused and lifted his plump gnome hand, counting on the fingers so that he could be precise. \"Just fifty-one hours ago.\" \"What do ye mean by he \u0027was over\u0027 Gondabuggan?\" Mickey asked. \"Did he attack the town, then?\" Gerbil nodded rapidly. \"With fire and talon!\" he replied. \"Of course, that is what one must expect from a dragon, unless the dragon is one of the lake variety. Then the expected attack mode ...\" \"Ye\u0027re sure?\" \"I am, if the dragon treatise is correct,\" Gerbil replied. \"Not about water dragons!\" Mickey retorted. \"Ye\u0027re sure that Robert flew over yer town, just fifty-one hours ago?\" \"I watched it with my own two eyes, of course,\" replied Gerbil. He nodded a greeting as the other three walked over to stand beside Kelsey. \"Oh, he came down in a tirade, breathing and kicking,\" the gnome went on, and his level of excitement seemed to rise accordingly with the rising audience. \"We .held him at bay, but I would guess that Robert is not yet finished with Gondabuggan! Oh, woe to my kin!\" Some of the others began to whisper; Pwyll\u0027s remarks were filled with forlorn, but Kelsey steeled his gaze, seemed to find something not quite right with Gerbil\u0027s dire tale. \"You were in Gondabuggan for Robert\u0027s attack just two days ago?\" the elf asked. As soon as Kelsey put it so plainly, Mickey went silent, understanding the elf\u0027s quite reasonable doubts. Gerbil counted quickly on his fingers again. \"Fifty-one hours,\" he replied with a nod. \"You have come a long way in fifty-one hours, good gnome,\" Kelsey remarked. \"Even though the weather has been fine and your .. .\" He looked to the weird contraption. \"Quadricycle,\" Gerbil explained. \"And your quadricycle is swift,\" Kelsey went on, \"Gnome Pass is many days from Drochit, and Drochit is still a day\u0027s ride from here.\" \"Oh, I could not take-the quadricycle through the mountains, of course,\" Gerbil retaliated. \"Too many rocks and trails too narrow, after all! Oh, no, I did not ride. I flew.\" \"On Robert\u0027s back, then?\" Mickey asked sarcastically. \"On the Mountain Messenger,\" Gerbil replied without missing a beat. \"It is a long descending tube, packed at precise points . . .\" \"I know of yer M\u0026M,\" Mickey assured the gnome. \"Are ye telling me that ye climbed into one o\u0027 them balls and got shot across the mountains?\" \"Landed in the field north of Drochit,\" Gerbil replied with a proud smile. \"Of course, if I had been splattered, then I would have had my name etched into the Plaque of Proud and Dead Inventors.\" The gnome gave a long sigh. \"Better to live at this time, though,\" he conceded. \"With the dragon about, after all.\" Gary, confused and intrigued, couldn\u0027t take any more of the rambling. \"What are you talking about?\" he demanded. \"It\u0027s a big cannon,\" Mickey answered before the gnome could get into a lengthy explanation. Mickey was more familiar with Gary\u0027s world than any of the others, having often snatched people from that place, and he knew how best to put the M\u0026M in terms that Gary Leger would understand. \"And he climbed in a hollow ball and got blasted across the mountains?\" Gary asked incredulously. \"Something like that,\" Mickey replied. He turned back to the gnome, wanting to hear more of Robert, but Gary wouldn\u0027t be so easily satisfied. \"How far?\" he asked. \"The distance has never actually been measured,\" Ger-bil was happy to explain. \"My calculations approximate it at forty miles, give or take seven hundred feet.\" Gary leaned back to consider this. He knew of battleships in his own world that could throw two-ton projectiles more than twenty miles, but, as he found the proper perspective, the prospect of hurling a ball with a living gnome inside twice that distance - and have the gnome crawl out alive - seemed absolutely ridiculous. He tuned back in as Gerbil was describing Robert\u0027s attack on Gondabuggan, how the gnomes put up a wall of water, and metallic umbrellas to fend off the attack. \"Impossible,\" Gary cut in as soon as the gnome paused to take a breath. \"No, really,\" Gerbil came right back. \"Umbrellas of properly folded plates, just like this.\" He reached for the handle to his smaller versions of similar umbrellas on the quadricycle. \"Not the umbrellas,\" Gary explained. \"There\u0027s no way you can hurl a ball that far.\" \"No way?\" Gerbil cried, throwing his hands up in absolute disgust. \"Never be saying \u0027no way\u0027 to a gnome, lad,\" Mickey whispered to Gary. \"Puts them all in a tizzy.\" And indeed, Gerbil Hamsmacker was in a tizzy. If Gary Leger had called the gnome\u0027s mother a thousand dirty names, or had called the race of gnomes thick-headed, it would not have upset the proud M\u0026M inventor any more than this. Gerbil blustered and threw his hands this way and that. He rambled off a series of calculations, followed by a series of curses at the thick-headed, dim-witted, slow-to-learn, never-to-understand humans. \"I just don\u0027t believe that you can launch a projectile that far,\" Gary began, wanting to explain that the speed and the impact would surely kill any passengers. \"How high up was the cannon? That ball would have to travel at ...\" \"Two hundred and seventy-two miles per hour,\" Gerbil proudly interjected. He looked sidelong at Kelsey. \"Two-seventy-three and you clip the overhang at Buck-toothed Ogre Pass.\" Geno tugged at Kelsey\u0027s tunic. \"I saw one hit that overhang once,\" he said. \"At night, and the sparks were far-to-see!\" Kelsey nodded, not doubting the tales, but Gary shook his head, finding it impossible, even amidst this land of impossibilities, to believe a word of it. \"But the landing,\" he started to protest, hardly able to find the words to properly express his whirling thoughts. \"Of course the target area was the descending slope of a field,\" Gerbil cut in. \"Peat mostly, and cow droppings. The trick, you see, is for the valves to release the precise amount of Earth-pull reversal solution at precisely the moment to slow the flight and soften the landing.\" \"Earth-pull reversal solution?\" Gary had to ask. \"Flying potion,\" Mickey quickly explained. \"I don\u0027t believe it.\" \"Ye don\u0027t believe in leprechauns either, lad,\" Mickey remarked. \"Remember?\" Gary stuttered over a few responses, then turned back to Gerbil, armed with more questions. \"He\u0027ll have an answer for anything ye ask,\" Mickey said before Gary could get on a roll. \"He\u0027s a gnome, after all.\" Gary\u0027s determined look faded to resignation. \"Precise amounts at precise moments?\" he asked the gnome. \"Precisely!\" Gerbil proudly cried, his cherubic face beaming as only the face of a gnome who had been praised for an invention could beam. Gary Leger let it go at that, just sat back and listened as the intriguing little gnome finished his tale. Then Gerbil stood up straight in his seat, looking all around as though he wasn\u0027t sure of where to go, or of where he had been. \"What were those nasty things?\" he asked. \"Some witch-mixed monsters, by me guess,\" Mickey replied, and he looked gravely at Kelsey as he spoke. Had Ceridwen extended her evil hand once more? they both wondered, and both, inevitably, knew the answer. \"I do not believe this to be a chance meeting,\" Kelsey added, speaking to Gerbil. \"You may find the road to Dilnamarra difficult, at best.\" \"Well, I am not so sure, not at all, that I have to go there anymore, though I would like to speak with the fat puppet, Baron Pwyll, to see what I might learn of the theft,\" Gerbil answered, but then he looked at Gary, obviously in possession of the supposedly stolen items, and gulped loudly. \"Then speak with him,\" Mickey offered with a mischievous grin, \"for to be sure, the fat puppet\u0027s but a few feet away.\" \"At your service,\" Pwyll remarked dryly, and Gerbil gulped again. But Pwyll took no real offense, and the overdue introductions were not strained at all. Kelsey was already figuring that they might have to go to Gondabug-gan, and in that case, Gerbil would prove a great help. Leprechauns got along well with gnomes, as did dwarfs, and even Geno put on a genuinely warm expression as he clasped the gnome\u0027s little hand. In the end, it was decided by all that Gerbil would remain with the group, backtracking to the east. The gnome spent a long while milling over the proposition, looking east and west repeatedly as though he wasn\u0027t sure of how he should proceed, but when Mickey reminded him of the airborne attack, he nodded his agreement and turned the quadricycle about. The group of six came to a ridge above Braemar, a small village of two dozen mostly single-chambered stone houses, late the next afternoon. There was no keep here, as there was in Dilnamarra, just a large central building, two stories high - which Mickey called the \"spoke-lock,\" the hub - surrounded by a cluster of town houses, including a blacksmith and other craftsmen, a trader, a supplier, and, of course, the infamous Snoozing Sprite tavern, wherein Geno had been captured by Baron PwylFs men. Beyond the central cluster of town rolled rock-lined fields of grazing sheep and highland cows, dotted here and there by the customary squat stone houses with their thick thatched roofs. \"We\u0027re sure to make a stir if we walk right in,\" Mickey reasoned. \"Especially if Geldion\u0027s got men down there.\" Kelsey looked around, in full agreement with the leprechaun. He didn\u0027t know how to weigh the potential reaction of Braemar to the disturbing news. Badenoch, the village\u0027s leader, was one of the few independent Barons in Faerie, often showing more support for Pwyll than for the emissaries of Connacht. But certainly, this unusual troupe would attract much attention. Geno could go in relatively safely, as dwarfs were not uncommon to Braemar, and though Geno might be recognized, he could easily concoct a story of escape from Pwyll\u0027s bumbling soldiers. Gerbil had already been to the sister town of Drochit, twenty miles to the north, and gnomes often visited Braemar, as well. The Tylwyth Teg were not common this far from Tir na n\u0027Og, not in these days of King Kinnemore\u0027s reign, but Kelsey, too, could probably go into Braemar without too much difficulty. Both humans would be more than welcome in the friendly town, except that if Pwyll was recognized, the word of his passing would spread throughout the countryside. And the armor, more fabulous than anything in all the land, would keep a crowd milling around Gary for every step. Few knights rode the fields in this dark time, and even the wealthiest of those who did had no metal plating to match the craftsmanship of Donigarten\u0027s legendary suit. Word of the theft had come this far north, according to Gerbil, and with it, undoubtedly, word that King Kinne-more wanted the armor retrieved. Who knew what friends of the throne, and independent bounty hunters perhaps, might be about, ready to seize the opportunity to get into Kinnemore\u0027s good graces and abundant treasures? Mickey would have the most difficulty of all in going into Braemar, though. Braemar was primarily a human settlement, and few men would look upon a leprechaun and not make chase, seeking the famed pot of gold. Mickey rarely ventured into any town, and never without using a clever disguise. Kelsey couldn\u0027t be certain, but it seemed to him that the leprechaun\u0027s illusions were not carrying the same strength as in the past. \"I doubt that Geldion has come this far,\" Kelsey said at length. \"And I wish to learn more of Robert\u0027s movements. Perhaps the dragon has been seen on this side of the mountain, and if not, we will need supplies to properly cross Dvergamal.\" Mickey nodded, but was not in agreement - -not with the elf\u0027s planned course, at least. Kelsey was talking about chasing the wyrm, but Mickey wanted only to get back to the Giant\u0027s Thumb, Robert\u0027s castle, and get back his precious pot of gold. \"Send in a couple, then,\" Mickey offered. \"Dwarf and gnome, and even ...\" Mickey put his stare on Pwyll, but shook his head suddenly and looked to Gary instead. \"... Gary Leger, as well,\" the leprechaun finished. \"But leave the spear and armor here,\" Mickey said to Gary. \"Ye\u0027ll not likely be needing them in the peaceable town.\" Few eyes turned with anything more than passing curiosity when the three companions wandered down the dirt streets of Braemar an hour later, Geno at the lead with Gary and Gerbil right behind. Many people were about, rushing mostly, and several approached the strangers with \"Have you heard of the dragon?\" or \"Good gnome, does Gondabuggan survive?\" Gary would have liked to stop and question these villagers in more depth - that was why they were in town, after all - but Geno gruffly excused himself from any budding conversation (usually with a stream of spittle heading the villager\u0027s way), and pulled the others along, moving with purpose towards the large central structure, the spoke-lock. Gary thought that the dwarf meant to go and find Lord Badenoch, Braemar\u0027s leader, and so he did not argue, but Geno went right past the main house, into a long and low building. Gary couldn\u0027t make out the runes on the sign outside the place\u0027s wide door, but the accompanying painting, that of a small pixie curled up peacefully amidst a patch of white clover, confirmed to him that this was the Snoozing Sprite tavern. The place was bustling, mostly with villagers, men and women, having their supper and talking of the dragon, and of the missing armor. \"Where should we sit?\" Gary asked, but he realized when he looked down to his sides that he was talking to himself. Gerbil had scooted off to the side, to talk to a tall and lean barkeep, and Geno was making his way through the crowd, spreading stumbling people in his wake, towards a far table where sat three other dwarfs. Gary started to follow, but remembered what he had learned of dwarven manners - mostly that the four would probably pick him up and heave him away if he interrupted them - and so he went to find his own table instead. He wound up along the far wall, well past the bar, at a round table built for four, and still covered with the bowls and spoons of the previous occupants. Gary looked around, saw no one objecting to his choice, and slipped into a chair, defensively putting his back against the wall. He leaned this way and that, trying to keep an eye on his friends among the crowd. Geno was still with the dwarfs, apparently they were friends, and Gary had to wonder if perhaps the dwarf\u0027s part in this adventure had just come to an end. Geno was ever the reluctant companion; if he had found some allies and was inclined to be done with the group, not Kelsey\u0027s sword nor Mickey\u0027s tricks would get him away. Across the way from Geno, Gerbil was sitting atop the bar, chatting easily with the barkeep, and with a crowd of curious men who had gathered around the gnome. They were seeking information about the dragon, Gary figured, and Gerbil was undoubtedly trying to find out what more, if anything, had happened to his town. \"That\u0027s me dad,\" came a sweet voice at Gary\u0027s side. Acting as though he had been caught Tom-peeping, Gary straightened suddenly in his chair - too suddenly, for he overbalanced and nearly toppled to the floor. Standing beside him, tray in hand, was a young lass of not more than twenty years, with shining red hair and a fresh complexion that no makeup could ever improve. Her eyes sparkled innocent, childlike, and Gary got the distinct feeling that she had grown up in a field of wildflowers, smiling at the simple pleasure of the warming sun. \"Sorry to startle ye,\" she offered, catching hold of Gary\u0027s shoulder and helping him to regain his balance. That done, the lass started to load the used bowls onto her tray. \"Me name\u0027s Constance, and that\u0027s me dad talking to yer little gnome friend.\" \"Oh,\" Gary replied, trying to digest it all. He extended his hand, pulled it back in to wipe the grime of the road off it, then held it out again. \"Pleased to meet you, Constance,\" he offered lamely with a strained, still-embarrassed smile. \"I\u0027ve not seen ye before in Braemar,\" Constance noted. \"Are ye passing through, or have ye come to find a hiding place from the dragon?\" \"What do you know of the dragon?\" Gary asked, trying futilely to hide his anxiety. \"Has he been seen near to here?\" \"Some say they\u0027ve seen him, but I think they\u0027re just trying to make themselves more important than they are,\" Constance replied with a mischievous wink - a wink that sent a shiver along Gary\u0027s spine. This was a beautiful girl, and though she was polite and proper, there remained something untamed about her, something that could melt a man\u0027s willpower. \"The only trusted word we\u0027ve beared came from Drochit,\" Constance went on. \"A gnome was there, so \u0027tis said, with word that Robert had attacked Gondabuggan. Last we beared, the gnome went west, to Dilnamarra, to speak with fat Pwyll and find out what had happened to Donigarten\u0027s suit. The two\u0027re related, so \u0027tis said.\" Gary nodded and pretended that it was all news to him. \"Anyway, it is exciting, isn\u0027t it?\" Constance asked, and her smile nearly knocked Gary off his chair as he nodded his agreement. \"And who might ye be?\" It took Gary a moment to even realize that he had been asked a question. \"Gary Leger,\" he replied without thinking. \"A strange name,\" Constance remarked offhandedly, and her delicate face screwed up as though she was trying to place the name. \"From Bretaigne, beyond Cancarron Mountains,\" Gary quickly added, using the alias that Mickey had concocted for him on his last trip through Faerie. \"Ah,\" Constance mewed. \"Ye\u0027re the one who came to Dilnamarra for the armor!\" Gary suddenly realized his error, knew that it was not good for him to be connected in any way with the events in Dilnamarra - not with Prince Geldion hot on their trail. \"No,\" he said, trying vainly to sound calm, and trying vainly to weave a believable lie. \"That was a different man, a cousin, I believe, though if he was, he was not one I\u0027ve ever met.\" Constance\u0027s doubting expression showed him how ridiculous he sounded. \"Oh,\" was all that she replied. \"Yeah, not one that I ever met,\" Gary said, and he glanced around to Geno and Gerbil again, wanting nothing more than to crawl out of that place. \"What might I be getting ye?\" Constance asked unexpectedly, her smile genuine, and enticing once more. Too many stutters escaped Gary\u0027s mouth. \"The leek soup\u0027s hot and warming,\" Constance suggested. \"Good enough,\" Gary replied, and Constance turned away. Gary realized that he might have a problem, though, so he grabbed frantically at her elbow. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said suddenly, letting go as Constance abruptly spun about to face him, and realizing that he probably shouldn\u0027t have done that. The girl, though, seemed to take no offense. \"I mean ... I have no money,\" Gary quickly explained. \"Oh.\" Constance seemed truly perplexed. \"Ye\u0027re traveling with not a pence?\" \"My friends ...\" Gary started to reply, but he wasn\u0027t sure what he might say about those two, so he didn\u0027t continue. \"Go and see then,\" Constance offered. \"And if they got nothing for ye, then let me talk to me dad. He\u0027s got something needing done around here, don\u0027t ye fret. I\u0027ve not ever seen him turn one away without a proper meal in his belly!\" Constance spun and kicked away, a young foal in an open field, and Gary slumped back in his chair, thoroughly charmed. His smile did not last, though. Not when he noticed that another group had taken an apparent interest in him. Four men, wearing the clothing of villagers, but with long dirks at their sides, were looking his way, their stubbly faces grimly set. They stopped Constance as she walked past, and asked her some questions, all the while looking back at Gary as he sat there, feeling very conspicuous. Constance went by them without incident and they talked among themselves for a few moments, as though everything was perfectly natural. Every now and then, though, one of them would look Gary\u0027s way, locking stares with the stranger. Gary felt the tension mounting as the minutes slipped past, felt all alone and dangerously out of place in a suddenly unwelcoming town. He tried to figure out what his next move should be, and only realized then that he did not have the sentient spear and the armor. \"Hurry up, Geno,\" he muttered under his breath, hoping that if it came to sudden blows, the dwarf and his tough companions would rush to his aid. But to Gary\u0027s shock, when he looked to the table, Geno and the others were not to be found. Gary groaned quietly; he could only believe that the dwarf had quit him and the whole adventure, had left him vulnerable. All four of the men were staring at him intently then, and his instincts told him to jump up and run for his life. The men whispered among themselves, started towards him. A hand clasped on Gary\u0027s shoulder, and he would have fallen to the floor had not the dwarf grabbed a tight hold and hoisted him to his feet. \"Come on,\" Geno said, and Gary really didn\u0027t have much choice but to follow, bending low in the unyielding grip, as the dwarf stormed away, for a side door that Ger-bil was holding open leading to the wing of private rooms. \"Here come some,\" Mickey remarked, and Kelsey and Baron Pwyll came up to the crest of the bluff, lying in the grass beside the leprechaun. Mickey pointed to the road, but it was obvious what he was talking about as six horsemen approached the town, some sporting longbows over their shoulders and others with sheathed swords at their hips. \"We must expect that the people of the surrounding areas will flock to the town, prepared for battle,\" Kelsey reasoned, trying to figure out what significance, if any, this group indicated. \"Lord Badenoch may have put out a call to arms.\" Mickey nodded hopefully, but Baron Pwyll was not convinced. \"In that case, he could not expect this group,\" the large man whispered. \"There, the one in the lead.\" He pointed to a large square-shouldered man with a bushy black beard, riding a tall roan stallion. The man carried no bow, but had an immense broadsword strapped to his back, its pommel rising up high behind him, higher than his head. \"Ye know him?\" Mickey asked. \"That\u0027s Redarm,\" Pwyll explained. \"Named for a wound he got in a sword fight, a wound that would have defeated a lesser man. He\u0027s one of Geldion\u0027s lackeys, by all that I\u0027ve heard.\" The Baron shook his head. \"No, this group would not have come to Badenoch\u0027s call.\" Mickey and Kelsey exchanged serious glances, both then instinctively looking to the unoccupied armor lying in the brush behind them at the base of the bluff.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dragon-s-dagger-spearwielder-s-tale-2/page-10.html","bookId":2185,"book":{"id":2185,"title":"The Dragon\u0027s Dagger (Spearwielder\u0027s Tale #2)","description":"Storyline: The Dragon\u0027s Dagger (Spearwielder\u0027s Tale #2) The sequel to The Woods Out Back.
