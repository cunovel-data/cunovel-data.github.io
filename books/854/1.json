{"id":24473,"no":1,"title":"PREFATORY NOTE","content":"The first essay in this volume, \"Ought Women to learn the Alphabet?\" appeared originally in the \"Atlantic Monthly\" of February, 1859, and has since been reprinted in various forms, bearing its share, I trust, in the great development of more liberal views in respect to the training and duties of women which has made itself manifest within forty years. There was, for instance, a report that it was the perusal of this essay which led the late Miss Sophia Smith to the founding of the women\u0027s college bearing her name at Northampton, Massachusetts. The remaining papers in the volume formed originally a part of a book entitled \"Common Sense About Women\" which was made up largely of papers from the \"Woman\u0027s Journal.\" This book was first published in 1881 and was reprinted in somewhat abridged form some years later in London (Sonnenschein). It must have attained a considerable circulation there, as the fourth (stereotyped) edition appeared in 1897. From this London reprint a German translation was made by Fr?ulein Eugenie Jacobi, under the title \"Die Frauenfrage und der gesunde Menschenverstand\" (Schupp: Neuwied and Leipzig, 1895). T.W.H.
