{"id":66464,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"SIXTY-TWO\n THE DOCTOR AND HIS WIFE WERE WAITING IN DOROTHY COE\u0027S truck, back on the two-lane road. Reacher and Dorothy parked ahead of them and they all got out and stood together. The Duncan compound was reduced to three vertical chimneys and a wide horizontal spread of ashy grey timbers that were still burning steadily, but no longer fiercely. Smoke was coming up and gathering into a wide column that seemed to rise for ever. It was the only thing moving. The sun was as high as it was going to get, and the rest of the sky was blue.\n Reacher said, \u0027You\u0027ve got a lot of work to do. Get everyone on it. Get backhoes and bucket loaders and dig some big holes. Really big holes. Then gather the trash and bury it deep. But save some space for later. Their van will arrive at some point, and the driver is just as guilty as the rest of them.\u0027\n The doctor said, \u0027We have to kill him?\u0027\n \u0027You can bury him alive, for all I care.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re leaving now?\u0027\n Reacher nodded.\n \u0027I\u0027m going to Virginia,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Can\u0027t you stay a day or two?\u0027\n \u0027You all are in charge now, not me.\u0027\n \u0027What about the football players at my house?\u0027\n \u0027Turn them loose and tell them to get out of town. They\u0027ll be happy to. There\u0027s nothing left for them here.\u0027\n The doctor said, \u0027But they might tell someone. Or someone might have seen the smoke. From far away. The cops might come.\u0027\n Reacher said, \u0027If they do, blame everything on me. Give them my name. By the time they figure out where I am, I\u0027ll be somewhere else.\u0027\n Dorothy Coe drove Reacher the first part of the way. They climbed back in the Yukon together and checked the gas gauge. There was enough for maybe sixty miles. They agreed she would take him thirty miles south, and then she would drive the same thirty miles back, and then after that filling the tank would be John\u0027s own problem.\n They drove the first ten miles in silence. Then they passed the abandoned roadhouse and the two-lane speared onward and empty ahead of them and Dorothy asked, \u0027What\u0027s in Virginia?\u0027\n \u0027A woman,\u0027 Reacher said.\n \u0027Your girlfriend?\u0027\n \u0027Someone I talked to on the phone, that\u0027s all. I wanted to meet her in person. Although now I\u0027m not so sure. Not yet, anyway. Not looking like this.\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s the matter with the way you look?\u0027\n \u0027My nose,\u0027 Reacher said. He touched the tape, and smoothed it down, two-handed. He said, \u0027It\u0027s going to be a couple of weeks before it\u0027s presentable.\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s her name, this woman in Virginia?\u0027\n \u0027Susan.\u0027\n \u0027Well, I think you should go. I think if Susan objects to the way you look, then she isn\u0027t worth meeting.\u0027\n They stopped at a featureless point on the road that had to be almost exactly halfway between the Apollo Inn and the Cell Block bar. Reacher opened his door and Dorothy Coe asked him, \u0027Will you be OK here?\u0027\n He nodded.\n He said, \u0027I\u0027ll be OK wherever I am. Will you be OK back there?\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 she said. \u0027But I\u0027ll be better than I was.\u0027\n She sat there behind the wheel, a solid, capable woman, about sixty years old, blunt and square, worn down by work, worn down by hardship, fading slowly to grey, but better than she had been before. Reacher said nothing, and climbed out to the shoulder, and closed his door. She looked at him once, through the window, and then she looked away and turned across the width of the road and drove back north. Reacher pulled his hat down over his ears and jammed his hands in his pockets against the cold, and got set to wait for a ride.\n He waited a long, long time. For the first hour nothing came by at all. Then a vehicle appeared on the horizon, and a whole minute later it was close enough to make out some detail. It was a small import, probably Japanese, a Honda or a Toyota, old, with blue paint faded by the weather. A sixth-hand purchase. Reacher stood up and stuck out his thumb. The car slowed, which didn\u0027t necessarily mean much. Pure reflex. A driver\u0027s eyes swivel right, and his foot lifts off the gas, automatically. In this case the driver was a woman, young, probably a college student. She had long fair hair. Her car was piled high inside with all kinds of stuff.\n She looked for less than a second and then accelerated and drove by at sixty, trailing cold air and whirling grit and tyre whine. Reacher watched her go. A good decision, probably. Lone women shouldn\u0027t stop in the middle of nowhere for giant unkempt strangers with duct tape on their faces.\n He sat down again on the shoulder. He was tired. He had woken up in Vincent\u0027s motel room early the previous morning, when Dorothy Coe came in to service it, and he hadn\u0027t slept since. He pulled his hood up over his hat and lay down on the dirt. He crossed his ankles and crossed his arms over his chest and went to sleep.\n It was going dark when he woke. The sun was gone in the west and the pale remains of a winter sunset were all that was lighting the sky. He sat up, and then he stood. No traffic. But he was a patient man. He was good at waiting.\n He waited ten more minutes, and saw another vehicle on the horizon. It had its lights on against the gloaming. He flipped his hood down to reduce his apparent bulk and stood easy, one foot on the dirt, one on the blacktop, and he stuck his thumb out. The approaching vehicle was bigger than a car. He could tell by the way the headlights were spaced. It was tall and relatively narrow. It had a big windshield. It was a panel van.\n It was a grey panel van.\n It was the same kind of grey panel van as the two grey panel vans he had seen at the Duncan depot.\n It slowed a hundred yards away, the automatic reflex, but then it kept on slowing, and it came to a stop right next to him. The driver leaned way over and opened the passenger door and a light came on inside.\n The driver was Eleanor Duncan.\n She was wearing black jeans and an insulated parka. The parka was covered in zips and pockets and it gleamed and glittered in the light. Its threads had been nowhere near any living thing, either plant or animal.\n She said, \u0027Hello.\u0027\n Reacher didn\u0027t answer. He was looking at the truck, inside and out. It was travel-stained. It had salt and dirt on it, all streaked and dried and dusty. It had been on a long journey.\n He said, \u0027This was the shipment, right? This is the truck they used.\u0027\n Eleanor Duncan nodded.\n He asked, \u0027Who was in it?\u0027\n Eleanor Duncan said, \u0027Six young women and ten young girls. From Thailand.\u0027\n \u0027Were they OK?\u0027\n \u0027They were fine. Not surprisingly. It seems that a lot of trouble had been taken to make sure they arrived in marketable condition.\u0027\n \u0027What did you do with them?\u0027\n \u0027Nothing.\u0027\n \u0027Then where are they?\u0027\n \u0027They\u0027re still in the back of this truck.\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027\n \u0027We didn\u0027t know what to do. They were lured here under false pretences, obviously. They were separated from their families. We decided we have to get them home again.\u0027\n \u0027How are you going to do that?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m driving them to Denver.\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s in Denver?\u0027\n \u0027There are Thai restaurants.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s your solution? Thai restaurants?\u0027\n \u0027It isn\u0027t nearly as dumb as it sounds. Think about it, Reacher. We can\u0027t go to the police. These women are illegal. They\u0027ll be detained for months, in a government jail. That would be awful for them. We thought at least they should be with people who speak their own language. Like a supportive community. And restaurant workers are connected, aren\u0027t they? Some of them were smuggled in themselves. We thought perhaps they could use the same organizations, but in reverse, to get out again.\u0027\n \u0027Whose idea was this?\u0027\n \u0027Everybody\u0027s. We discussed it all day, and then we voted.\u0027\n \u0027Terrific.\u0027\n \u0027You got a better idea?\u0027\n Reacher said nothing. He just looked at the blank grey side of the van, and its salt stains, all dried in long feathered aerodynamic patterns. He put his palm on the cold metal.\n Eleanor Duncan asked, \u0027You want to meet them?\u0027\n Reacher said, \u0027No.\u0027\n \u0027You saved them.\u0027\n Reacher said, \u0027Luck and happenstance saved them. Therefore I don\u0027t want to meet them. I don\u0027t want to see their faces, because then I\u0027ll get to thinking about what would have happened to them if luck and happenstance hadn\u0027t come along.\u0027\n There was a long pause. The van idled, the breeze blew, the sky darkened, the air grew colder.\n Then Eleanor Duncan said, \u0027You want a ride to the highway at least?\u0027\n Reacher nodded and climbed in.\n They didn\u0027t talk for twenty miles. Then they rumbled past the Cell Block bar and Reacher said, \u0027You knew, didn\u0027t you?\u0027\n Eleanor Duncan said, \u0027No.\u0027 Then she said, \u0027Yes.\u0027 Then she said, \u0027I thought I knew the exact opposite. I really did. I thought I knew it for absolute sure. I knew it so intensely that eventually I realized I was just trying to convince myself.\u0027\n \u0027You knew where Seth came from.\u0027\n \u0027I told you I didn\u0027t. Just before you stole his car.\u0027\n \u0027And I didn\u0027t believe you. Up to that point you had answered fourteen consecutive questions with no hesitation at all. Then I asked you about Seth, and you stalled. You offered us a drink. You were evasive. You were buying time to think.\u0027\n \u0027Do you know where Seth came from?\u0027\n \u0027I figured it out eventually.\u0027\n She said, \u0027So tell me your version.\u0027\n Reacher said, \u0027The Duncans liked little girls. They always had. It was their lifelong hobby. People like that form communities. Back in the days before the internet they did it by mail and clandestine face to face meetings. Photo swaps, and things like that. Maybe conventions. Maybe guest participation. There were alliances between interest groups. My guess is a group that liked little boys was feeling some heat. They went to ground. They fostered the evidence with their pals. It was supposed to be temporary, until the heat went away, but no one came back for Seth. The guy was probably beaten to death in jail. Or by the cops, in a back room. So the Duncans were stuck. But they were OK with it. Maybe they thought it was kind of cute, to get a son without the involvement of a real grown woman. So they kept him. Jacob adopted him.\u0027\n Eleanor Duncan nodded. \u0027Seth told me he had been rescued. Back when we still talked. He said Jacob had rescued him out of an abusive situation. Like an act of altruism and charity. And principle. I believed him. Then over the years I sensed the Duncans were doing something bad, but what turned out to be the truth was always the last thing on my mental list. Always, I promise you. Because I felt they were so opposed to that kind of thing. I felt that rescuing Seth had proved it. I was blind for a long time. I thought they were shipping something else, like drugs or guns, or bombs, even.\u0027\n \u0027What changed?\u0027\n \u0027Things I heard. Just snippets. It became clear to me they were shipping people. Even then I thought it was just regular illegals. Like restaurant workers and so on.\u0027\n \u0027Until?\u0027\n \u0027Until nothing. I never knew for sure, until today. I promise you that. But I was getting more and more suspicious. There was too much money. And too much excitement. They were practically drooling. Even then I didn\u0027t believe it. Especially with Seth. I thought he would find that kind of thing totally repulsive, because he had suffered it himself. I didn\u0027t want to think it could cut the other way. But I guess it did. I suppose ultimately it was all he knew. And all he ever enjoyed.\u0027\n Reacher said, \u0027I\u0027m no psychologist either.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m so ashamed,\u0027 Eleanor said. \u0027I\u0027m not going back. They think I am, but I\u0027m not. I can\u0027t face them. I can\u0027t be there ever again.\u0027\n \u0027So what are you going to do?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m going to give this truck to whoever helps the people in it. Like a donation. Like a bribe. Then I\u0027m going somewhere else. California, maybe.\u0027\n \u0027How?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m going to hitchhike, like you. Then I\u0027m going to start over.\u0027\n \u0027Take care on the road. It can be dangerous.\u0027\n \u0027I know. But I don\u0027t care. I feel like I deserve whatever I get.\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t be too hard on yourself. At least you called the cops.\u0027\n She said, \u0027But they never came.\u0027\n Reacher didn\u0027t answer.\n She said, \u0027How do you know I called the cops?\u0027\n \u0027Because they came,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027In a manner of speaking. That\u0027s the one thing no one ever asked me. No one put two and two together. Everyone knew I was hitchhiking, but no one ever wondered why I had been let out at a crossroads that didn\u0027t lead anywhere. Why would a driver stop there? Either he wouldn\u0027t have gotten there at all, or he would have carried on south for another sixty miles at least.\u0027\n \u0027So who was he?\u0027\n \u0027He was a cop,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027State Police, in an unmarked car. He didn\u0027t say so, but it was pretty obvious. Nice enough guy. He picked me up way to the north. Almost in South Dakota. He told me he would have to drop me off in the middle of nowhere, because all he was doing was heading down and back. We didn\u0027t talk about reasons, and I didn\u0027t know he meant he was going back immediately. But that\u0027s what he did. He pulled over, he let me out, and then two seconds later he turned around and took off again, right back the way we had come.\u0027\n \u0027Why would he?\u0027\n \u0027GPS and politics,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027That was my first guess. A big state like Nebraska, I figured there could be bitching and moaning about which parts get attention, and which don\u0027t. So I thought maybe they were defending themselves in advance. They could come out with still frames from their GPS systems to show they\u0027ve been everywhere in the state at one time or another. Cop cars all have trackers now, and all that kind of stuff can be subpoenaed if they get called in front of a committee. Then a little later on I changed my mind. I wondered if they\u0027d had a bullshit call from someone, and they knew they weren\u0027t going to do anything about it, but they still needed to cover their asses by being able to prove they had showed up, at least. Then later still I wondered if it hadn\u0027t been such a bullshit call after all, and whether it was you who had made it.\u0027\n \u0027It was me. Four days ago. And it wasn\u0027t a bullshit call. I told them everything I was thinking. Why didn\u0027t the guy even get out of his car?\u0027\n \u0027Prejudice and local knowledge,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027I bet you mentioned Seth beat you.\u0027\n \u0027Well, yes, I did. Because he did.\u0027\n \u0027Therefore they ignored everything else you said. They put it down to a wronged wife making stuff up to get her husband in trouble. Cops can be like that sometimes. It ain\u0027t right, but that\u0027s how it is. And they certainly weren\u0027t going to tackle the domestic issue itself. Not against the Duncans. Because of local knowledge. Dorothy Coe told me some neighbourhood kids join the State Police. So either they were asked, or else the story had already gotten around some other way, but in either case the message was the same, which was, in that corner of that county, you can\u0027t mess with the Duncans.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t believe it.\u0027\n \u0027You tried,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027Along with everything else, you have to remember that. You tried to do the right thing.\u0027\n They drove on and blew through what counted as the downtown area, past the Chamber of Commerce billboard, past the aluminium coach diner, past the gas station with its Texaco sign and its three service bays, past the hardware store, and the liquor store, and the bank, and the tyre shop and the John Deere dealership and the grocery and the pharmacy, past the water tower, past McNally Street, past the signpost to the hospital, and onward into territory Reacher hadn\u0027t seen before. The van\u0027s engine muttered low, and the tyres hummed, and from time to time Reacher thought he heard sounds from the load space behind him, people moving around, talking occasionally, even laughing. Beside him Eleanor Duncan concentrated on the dark road ahead, and he watched her in the corner of his eye.\n Then an hour and sixty miles later they saw bright vapour lights at the highway cloverleaf, and big green signs pointing west and east. Eleanor slowed and stopped and Reacher got out and waved her away. She used the first ramp, west towards Denver and Salt Lake City, and he walked under the bridge and set up on the eastbound ramp, one foot on the shoulder and one in the traffic lane, and he stuck out his thumb and smiled and tried to look friendly. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-dying-for-jack-reacher-15/page-27.html","bookId":2348,"book":{"id":2348,"title":"Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher #15)","description":"Storyline: \n Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher #15) \n There’s deadly trouble in the corn county of Nebraska . . . and Jack Reacher walks right into it.
