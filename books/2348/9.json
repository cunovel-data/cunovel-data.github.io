{"id":66446,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"TWENTY-TWO\\n\\n THE CANADIAN SEMI TRUCK WITH THE DUNCANS\u0027 SHIPMENT aboard was making good time, heading due east on Route 3 in British Columbia, driving mostly parallel to the die-straight international border, with Alberta up ahead. Route 3 was a lonely road, mountainous, with steep grades and tight turns. Not ideal for a large vehicle. Most drivers took Route 1, which looped north out of Vancouver before turning east later. A better road, all things considered. Route 3 was quiet by comparison. It had long stretches of nothing but asphalt ribbon and wild scenery. And very little traffic. And occasional gravel turnouts, for rest and recuperation.\\n\\n One of the gravel turn-outs was located a mile or so before the Waterton Lakes National Park. In U.S. terms it was directly above the Washington-Idaho state line, about halfway between Spokane and Coeur d\u0027Alene, about a hundred miles north of both. The turn-out had an amazing view. Endless forest to the south, the snowy bulk of the Rockies to the east, magnificent lakes to the north. The truck driver pulled off and parked there, but not for the view. He parked there because it was a prearranged location, and because a white panel van was waiting there for him. The Duncans had been in business a long time, because of luck and caution, and one of their cautionary principles was to transfer their cargo between vehicles as soon as possible after import. Shipping containers could be tracked. Indeed they were designed to be tracked, by the BIC code. Better not to risk a delayed alert from a suspicious Customs agent. Better to move the goods within hours, into something anonymous and forgettable and untraceable, and white panel vans were the most anonymous and forgettable and untraceable vehicles on earth.\\n\\n The semi truck parked and the panel van K-turned on the gravel and backed up to it and stopped rear to rear with it. Both drivers got out. They didn\u0027t speak. They just stepped out into the roadway and craned their necks and checked what was coming, one east, one west. Nothing was coming, which was not unusual for Route 3, so they jogged back to their vehicles and got to work. The van driver opened his rear doors, and the truck driver climbed up on his flatbed and cut the plastic security seal and smacked the bolts and levers out of their brackets and opened the container\u0027s doors.\\n\\n One minute later the cargo was transferred, all 1,260 pounds of it, and another minute after that the white van had K-turned again and was heading east, and the semi truck was trailing behind it for a spell, its driver intending to turn north on 95 and then loop back west on Route 1, a better road, back to Vancouver for his next job, which was likely to be legitimate, and therefore better for his blood pressure but worse for his wallet.\\n\\n In Las Vegas the Lebanese man named Safir selected his two best guys and dispatched them to babysit the Italian man named Rossi. An unwise decision, as it turned out. Its unwisdom was made clear within the hour. Safir\u0027s phone rang and he answered it, and found himself talking to an Iranian man named Mahmeini. Mahmeini was Safir\u0027s customer, but there was no transactional equality in their business relationship. Mahmeini was Safir\u0027s customer in the same way a king might have been a boot maker\u0027s customer. Much more powerful, imperious, superior, dismissive, and likely to be lethally angry if the boots were defective.\\n\\n Or late.\\n\\n Mahmeini said, \u0027I should have received my items a week ago.\u0027\\n\\n Safir couldn\u0027t speak. His mouth was dry.\\n\\n Mahmeini said, \u0027Please look at it from my point of view. Those items are already allocated, to certain people in certain places, for certain date-specific uses. If they are not delivered in time, I\u0027ll take a loss.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll make good,\u0027 Safir said.\\n\\n \u0027I know you will. That\u0027s the purpose of my call. We have much to discuss. Because my loss won\u0027t be a one-time thing. It will be ongoing. My reputation will be ruined. Why would my contacts trust me again? I\u0027ll lose their business for ever. Which means you\u0027ll have to compensate me for ever. In effect I will own you for the rest of your life. Do you see my point?\u0027\\n\\n All Safir could say was, \u0027I believe the shipment is actually on its way, as of right now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A week late.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m suffering too. And I\u0027m trying to do something about it. I made my contact send two of his men up there. And then I sent two of my men over to him, to make sure he concentrates.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Men?\u0027 Mahmeini said. \u0027You employ men? Or boys?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027re good people.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re about to find out what men are. I\u0027m sending two of mine. To you. To make sure you concentrate.\u0027\\n\\n Then the phone went dead, and Safir was left sitting there, awaiting the arrival of two Iranian tough guys in an office that had, just an hour ago, been stripped of the better half of its security.\\n\\n Reacher made it to the two wooden buildings without further trouble, which was no big surprise to him. Six remaining football players and two out-of-towners made a total of just eight warm bodies, and he guessed the out-of-towners would be riding together, which made a total of just seven roving vehicles loose in a county that must have covered many hundreds of square miles. One random encounter had been fortuitous in the extreme. Two would be incalculably unlikely.\\n\\n The old barn was still locked and listing, and the pick-up truck was still hidden in the smaller shelter. Undiscovered and undisturbed, as far as Reacher could tell. It was cold and inert. The air in the shelter was dry, and it smelled of dust and mouse droppings. The countryside all around was empty and silent.\\n\\n Reacher opened up the tool locker in the pick-up\u0027s load bed and took a look at the contents. The biggest thing left in there was an adjustable wrench about a foot long. Some kind of polished steel alloy. It weighed about a pound and a half. Made in the U.S.A. Not the greatest weapon in the world, but better than nothing. Reacher put it in his coat pocket and rooted around for more. He came up with two screwdrivers, one a stubby Phillips cross-head design with a rubber handle, and one a long slender thing with a regular blade for a regular slotted screw. He put them in his other pocket and closed the locker and climbed in the cab. He started up and backed out and then he followed the deep tractor ruts all the way east to the road, where he turned north and headed for the motel.\\n\\n Safir\u0027s two tough guys arrived in Rossi\u0027s office carrying guns in shoulder holsters and black nylon bags in their hands. They unpacked the bags on Rossi\u0027s desk, right in front of him. The first bag carried just one item, and the second bag carried two items. From the first bag came a belt sander, already loaded with a fresh loop of coarse-grain abrasive. From the second bag came a propane blowtorch and a roll of duct tape.\\n\\n Tools of the trade.\\n\\n And therefore an unmistakable message, to a guy in Rossi\u0027s world. In Rossi\u0027s world victims were taped naked to chairs, and belt sanders were fired up and applied to tender areas like knees or elbows or chests. Or faces, even. Then blowtorches were sparked to life for a little extra fun.\\n\\n Nobody spoke.\\n\\n Rossi dialled his phone. Three rings, and Roberto Cassano answered, in Nebraska. Rossi said, \u0027What the hell is happening up there? This thing really can\u0027t wait.\u0027\\n\\n Cassano said, \u0027We\u0027re chasing shadows.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Chase them harder.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s the point? Who knows whether this guy has anything to do with anything? You told us you figure he\u0027s an excuse. So whatever happens to him isn\u0027t going to make the shipment show up any faster.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Have you ever told a lie?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not to you, boss.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027To anyone else?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sure.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then you know how it goes. You arrange things to make sure you don\u0027t get caught out. And I think that\u0027s what those Duncan bastards are going to do. They\u0027re going to hold the shipment somewhere until the guy gets caught. To make it look like they were telling the truth all along. Like cause and effect. So whether we want to or not, we\u0027re going to have to play their game their way. So find this asshole, will you? And fast. This thing can\u0027t wait.\u0027\\n\\n Rossi clicked off the call. One of the Lebanese guys had been unrolling the belt sander\u0027s cord. Now he bent down and plugged it in. He flicked the switch, just a blip, just a second, and the machine started and whirred and stopped.\\n\\n A test.\\n\\n A message.\\n\\n Reacher drove to the motel and parked next to the doctor\u0027s wrecked Subaru. It was still there, outside cabin six. He got out and squatted down front and rear and used the smaller screwdriver from his pocket to take the plates off the pick-up truck. Then he took the plates off the Subaru and put them on the pick-up. He tossed the pick-up\u0027s plates into the load bed and put the screwdriver back in his pocket and headed for the lounge.\\n\\n Vincent was in there, behind the bar, wiping it with a rag. He had a black eye and a thick lip and a swelling the size of a mouse\u0027s back on his cheek. One of the mirrors behind him was broken. Pieces of glass the shape of lightning bolts had fallen out. Old wallboard was exposed, taped and yellowing, earthbound and prosaic. The room\u0027s cheerful illusion was diminished.\\n\\n Reacher said, \u0027I\u0027m sorry I got you in trouble.\u0027\\n\\n Vincent asked, \u0027Did you spend the night here?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you really want to know?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, I guess I don\u0027t.\u0027\\n\\n Reacher checked himself in the broken mirror. One ear was scabbing over, where he had scraped it on the rock. His face had scratches from the thorns. His hands, too, and his back, where his coat and shirt and sweater had ridden up. He asked, \u0027Did those guys have a list of places they were looking?\u0027\\n\\n Vincent said, \u0027I imagine they\u0027ll go house to house.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What are they driving?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A rental.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Colour?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It was something dark. Dark blue, maybe? A Chevrolet, I think.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did they say who they were?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just that they were representing the Duncans. That\u0027s how they put it. I\u0027m sorry I told them about Dorothy.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She did OK,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027Don\u0027t worry about it. She\u0027s had bigger troubles in her life.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You think the Duncans killed her kid?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I would like to. It would fit with what we think we know about them.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There was no evidence. Absolutely none at all. And it was a very thorough investigation. Lots of different agencies. Very professional. I doubt if they missed anything.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So it was just a coincidence?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It must have been.\u0027\\n\\n Reacher said nothing.\\n\\n Vincent asked, \u0027What are you going to do now?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A couple of things,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027Maybe three. Then I\u0027m out of here. I\u0027m going to Virginia.\u0027\\n\\n He walked back out to the lot and climbed into the pick-up truck. He fired it up and took off, out to the road, towards the doctor\u0027s house.\\n\\n TWENTY-THREE\\n\\n MAHMEINI\u0027S TWO TOUGH GUYS ARRIVED IN SAFIR\u0027S LAS VEGAS office about an hour after Safir\u0027s own two tough guys had left it. Mahmeini\u0027s men were not physically impressive. No straining shirt collars, no bulging muscles. They were small and wiry, dark and dead-eyed, rumpled, and not very clean. Safir was Lebanese and he knew plenty of Iranians. Most of them were the nicest people in the world, especially when they lived somewhere else. But some of them were the worst. These two had brought nothing with them. No bags, no tools, no equipment. They didn\u0027t need any. Safir knew they would have guns under their arms and knives in their pockets. It was the knives he was worried about. Guns were fast. Knives were slow. And these two Iranians could be very slow with knives. And very inventive. Safir knew that for a fact. He had seen one of their victims, out in the desert. A little decomposed, but even so the cops had taken longer than they should even to determine the sex of the corpse. Which was no surprise. There had been no external evidence of gender. None at all.\\n\\n Safir dialled his phone. Three rings, and one of his guys answered, six blocks away. Safir said, \u0027Give me a progress report.\u0027\\n\\n His guy said, \u0027It\u0027s all messed up.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Evidently. But I need more than that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027OK, it turns out Rossi\u0027s contacts are a bunch of Nebraska people called Duncan. They\u0027re all in an uproar over some guy poking around. Nothing to do with anything, probably, but Rossi thinks the Duncans are going to stall until the guy is down, to save face, because they\u0027ve been claiming the guy is the cause of the delay. Which Rossi thinks is most likely bullshit, but the whole thing has gone completely circular. Rossi thinks nothing is going to happen now until the guy is captured. He\u0027s got boys up there, working on it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How hard?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027As hard as they can, I guess.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tell Rossi to tell them to work harder. Much, much harder. And make sure he knows I\u0027m serious, OK? Tell him I\u0027ve got people in my office too, and if I\u0027m going to get hurt over this, then he\u0027s going to get hurt first, and twice as bad.\u0027\\n\\n Reacher remembered the way to the doctor\u0027s house from the night before. In daylight the roads looked different. More open, less secret. More exposed. They were just narrow ribbons of blacktop, built up a little higher than the surrounding dirt, unprotected by hedgerows, unshaded by trees. The morning mist had risen up and was now a layer of low cloud at about five hundred feet. The whole sky was like a flat lit panel, casting baleful illumination everywhere. No glare, no shadows.\\n\\n But Reacher arrived OK. The plain ranch house, the couple of flat acres, the post-and-rail fence. In the daylight the house looked raw and new. There was a satellite dish on the roof. There were no cars on the driveway. No dark blue Chevrolet. No neighbours, either. The nearest house might have been a mile away. On three sides there was nothing beyond the doctor\u0027s fence except dirt, tired and hibernating, waiting for ploughing and seeding in the spring. On the fourth side was the road, and then more dirt, flat and featureless all the way to the horizon. The doctor and his wife were not gardeners. That was clear. Their lot was all grass, from the base of the fence posts to the foundation of the house. No bushes, no evergreens, no flowerbeds.\\n\\n Reacher parked on the driveway and walked to the door. It had a spy hole. A little glass lens, like a fat drop of water. Common in a city. Unusual in a rural area. He rang the bell. There was a long delay. He guessed he wasn\u0027t the first visitor of the day. More likely the third. Hence the reluctance on the part of the doctor and his wife to open up. But open up they did, eventually. The spy hole darkened and then lightened again and the door swung back slowly and Reacher saw the woman he had met the night before, standing there in the hallway, looking a little surprised but plenty relieved.\\n\\n \u0027You,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, me,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027Not them.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thank God.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027When were they here?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027This morning.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What happened?\u0027\\n\\n The woman didn\u0027t answer. She just stepped back. A mute invitation. Reacher stepped in and walked down the hallway and found out pretty much what had happened when he came face to face with the doctor. The guy was a little damaged, in much the same way that Vincent was, over at the motel. Bruising around the eyes, swellings, blood in the nostrils, splits in the lips. Loose teeth too, probably, judging by the way the guy was pursing his mouth and moving his tongue, as if he was pressing them home, or counting how many were left. Four blows, Reacher figured, each one hard but subtly different in placement. Expert blows.\\n\\n Reacher asked, \u0027Do you know who they are?\u0027\\n\\n The doctor said, \u0027No. They\u0027re not from around here.\u0027 His words were thick and indistinct and hard to decipher. Loose teeth, split lips. And a hangover, presumably. \u0027They said they were representing the Duncans. Not working for them. So they\u0027re not hired hands. We don\u0027t know who they are or what their connection is.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What did they want?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You, of course.\u0027\\n\\n Reacher said, \u0027I\u0027m very sorry for your trouble.\u0027\\n\\n The doctor said, \u0027It is what it is.\u0027\\n\\n Reacher turned back to the doctor\u0027s wife. \u0027Are you OK?\u0027\\n\\n She said, \u0027They didn\u0027t hit me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t want to talk about it. Why are you here?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I need medical treatment,\u0027 Reacher said.\\n\\n \u0027What kind?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I got scratched by thorns. I want to get the cuts cleaned.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Really?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, not really,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027I need some painkillers, that\u0027s all. I haven\u0027t been able to rest my arms like I hoped.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What do you really want?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I want to talk,\u0027 Reacher said.\\n\\n They started in the kitchen. They cleaned his cuts, purely as a way of occupying themselves. The doctor\u0027s wife said she had trained as a nurse. She poured some thin stinging liquid into a bowl and used cotton balls. She started on his face and neck and then did his hands. She made him take off his shirt. His back was all ripped up by the long scrabbling escape from under the truck. He said, \u0027I had breakfast with Dorothy this morning. At her place.\u0027\\n\\n The doctor\u0027s wife said, \u0027You shouldn\u0027t be telling us that. It could get her in trouble.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Only if you rat her out to the Duncans.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We might have to.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She said she\u0027s a friend of yours.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not really a friend. She\u0027s much older.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She said you stood by her, twenty-five years ago.\u0027\\n\\n The woman said nothing. Just continued her careful ministrations behind his back. She was thorough. She was opening each scratch with thumb and forefinger, and swabbing extensively. The doctor said, \u0027Would you like a drink?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Too early for me,\u0027 Reacher said.\\n\\n \u0027I meant coffee,\u0027 the doctor said. \u0027You were drinking coffee last night.\u0027\\n\\n Reacher smiled. The guy was trying to prove he could remember something. Trying to prove he hadn\u0027t been really drunk, trying to prove he wasn\u0027t really hung over.\\n\\n \u0027A cup of coffee is always welcome,\u0027 Reacher said.\\n\\n The doctor stepped away to the sink and got a drip machine going. Then he came back and took Reacher\u0027s arm, like doctors do, his fingertips in Reacher\u0027s palm, lifting, turning, manipulating. The doctor was small and Reacher\u0027s arm was big. The guy was struggling like a butcher with a side of beef. He dug the fingers of his other hand deep into Reacher\u0027s shoulder joint, poking, feeling, probing.\\n\\n \u0027I could give you cortisone,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Do I need it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It would help.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How much?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A little. Maybe more than a little. You should think about it. It would ease the discomfort. Right now it\u0027s nagging at you. Probably making you tired.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027OK,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027Go for it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I will,\u0027 the doctor said. \u0027In exchange for some information.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Like what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How did you hurt yourself?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why do you want to know?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Call it professional interest.\u0027\\n\\n The doctor\u0027s wife finished her work. She tossed the last cotton ball on the table and handed Reacher his shirt. He shrugged it on and started buttoning it. He said, \u0027It was like you figured. I was caught in a hurricane.\u0027\\n\\n The doctor said, \u0027I don\u0027t believe you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not a natural weather event. I was in an underground chamber. It caught on fire. There was a stair shaft and two ventilation shafts. I was lucky. The flames went up the ventilation shafts. I was on the stairs. So I wasn\u0027t burned. But air to feed the fire was coming down the stair shaft just as hard as the flames were going back up the ventilation shafts. So it was like climbing through a hurricane. It blew me back down twice. I couldn\u0027t keep my feet. In the end I had to haul myself up by the arms.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How far?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Two hundred and eighty steps.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Wow. That would do it. Where was this?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s outside of your professional interest.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then what happened?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s outside of your professional interest, too.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Recent event, yes?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Feels like yesterday,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027Now go get the needle.\u0027\\n\\n It was a long needle. The doctor went away and came back with a stainless steel syringe that looked big enough for a horse. He made Reacher take his shirt off again and sit forward with his elbow on the table. He eased the sharp point deep into the joint, from the back. Reacher felt it pushing and popping through all kinds of tendons and muscles. The doctor pressed the plunger, slow and steady. Reacher felt the fluid flood the joint. Felt the joint loosen and relax, in real time, immediately, like healing insanely accelerated. Then the doctor did the other shoulder. Same procedure. Same result.\\n\\n \u0027Wonderful,\u0027 Reacher said.\\n\\n The doctor asked, \u0027What did you want to talk about?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A time long ago,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027When your wife was a kid.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-dying-for-jack-reacher-15/page-9.html","bookId":2348,"book":{"id":2348,"title":"Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher #15)","description":"Storyline: Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher #15) \\n There’s deadly trouble in the corn county of Nebraska . . . and Jack Reacher walks right into it.
