{"id":66452,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"THIRTY-FOUR THE OLD CAPRICE\u0027S REAR BENCH WAS CONTOURED LIKE TWO separate bucket seats, not by design but by age and relentless wear and tear. Mahmeini\u0027s man settled into the right-hand pit, behind the front passenger seat, and cocked his head to the left so he could see out the windshield. He saw the blank back of a billboard in the headlight beams, and then he saw nothing. The road ahead was straight and empty. No oncoming lights, which was a disappointment. One drink on Asghar\u0027s part might be overlooked. Or even two. Or three, followed by a prompt return. But a night of it would be considered desertion. The wheezing old motor had the needle trembling over the sixty mark. A mile a minute. Nine more miles to go. Nine minutes. Reacher said, \u0027Exactly one hour and ten minutes from now, I want you to take a drive. In your little red sports car.\u0027 Eleanor Duncan said, \u0027A drive? Where?\u0027 \u0027South on the two-lane,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027Just drive. Eleven miles. As fast as you want. Then turn around and go home again.\u0027 \u0027Eleven miles?\u0027 \u0027Or twelve. Or more. But not less than ten.\u0027 \u0027Why?\u0027 \u0027Doesn\u0027t matter why. Will you do it?\u0027 \u0027Are you going to do something to the house? You want me out of the way?\u0027 \u0027I won\u0027t come near the house. I promise. No one will ever know. Will you do it?\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t. Seth took my car key. I\u0027m grounded.\u0027 \u0027Is there a spare?\u0027 \u0027He took that too.\u0027 Reacher said, \u0027He\u0027s not carrying them around in his pocket. Not if he keeps his own key in a bowl in the kitchen.\u0027 Eleanor said nothing. Reacher asked, \u0027Do you know where they are?\u0027 \u0027Yes. They\u0027re on his desk.\u0027 \u0027On or in?\u0027 \u0027On. Just sitting there. Like a test for me. He says obedience without temptation is meaningless.\u0027 \u0027Why the hell are you still there?\u0027 \u0027Where else could I go?\u0027 \u0027Just take the damn keys, will you? Stand up for yourself.\u0027 \u0027Will this hurt Seth?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know how you want me to answer that question.\u0027 \u0027I want you to answer it honestly.\u0027 \u0027It might hurt him indirectly. And eventually. Possibly.\u0027 There was a long pause. Then Eleanor said, \u0027OK, I\u0027ll do it. I\u0027ll drive south eleven miles on the two-lane and come back again. An hour and ten minutes from now.\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027An hour and six minutes from now. We\u0027ve just been talking for four minutes.\u0027 He hung up and stepped back to the main public room. The barman was working like a good barman should, using fast efficient movements, thinking ahead, watching the room. He caught Reacher\u0027s eye and Reacher detoured towards him and the guy said, \u0027I should get you to sign a napkin or something. Like a memento. You\u0027re the only guy who ever came in here to use a phone, not avoid one. You want a drink?\u0027 Reacher scanned what the guy had to offer. Liquor of all kinds, beer on tap, beer in bottles, sodas. No sign of coffee. He said, \u0027No thanks, I\u0027m good. I should hit the road.\u0027 He moved on, shuffling sideways between the tables, and he pushed out the door and walked back to his car. He got in, started up, backed out and drove away north. Mahmeini\u0027s man saw a glow in the air, far ahead on the left. Neon, green and red and blue. The driver kept his foot down for a minute more, and then he lifted off and coasted. The engine coughed and the exhaust popped and sputtered and the taxi slowed. Way far up the road in the distance were a pair of red tail lights. Very faint and far away. Almost not there at all. The taxi braked. Mahmeini\u0027s man saw the bar. Just a simple wooden building. There were two weak spotlights under the eaves at the front. They threw two pools of token light into the lot. There were plenty of parked vehicles. But no yellow rental. The taxi pulled in and stopped. The driver looked back over his shoulder. Mahmeini\u0027s man said, \u0027Wait for me.\u0027 The driver said, \u0027How long?\u0027 \u0027A minute.\u0027 Mahmeini\u0027s man got out and stood still. The tail lights in the north had disappeared. Mahmeini\u0027s man watched the darkness where they had been, just for a second. Then he walked to the wooden building\u0027s door. He entered. He saw a large room, with chairs and tables on the left and a bar on the right. There were about twenty customers in the room, mostly men, none of them Asghar Arad Sepehr. There was a barman behind the bar, serving a customer, lining up the next, glancing over at the new arrival. Mahmeini\u0027s man threaded between the tables towards him. He felt that everyone was watching him. A small man, foreign, unshaven, rumpled, and not very clean. The barman\u0027s customer peeled away, holding two foaming glasses of beer. The barman moved on, to the next customer, serving him, but glancing beyond him for the next in line, as if he was planning two moves ahead. Mahmeini\u0027s man said, \u0027I\u0027m looking for someone.\u0027 The barman said, \u0027I guess we all are, sir. That\u0027s the very essence of human nature, isn\u0027t it? It\u0027s an eternal quest.\u0027 \u0027No, I\u0027m looking for someone I know. A friend of mine.\u0027 \u0027A lady or a gentleman?\u0027 \u0027He looks like me.\u0027 \u0027Then I haven\u0027t seen him. I\u0027m sorry.\u0027 \u0027He has a yellow car.\u0027 \u0027Cars are outside. I\u0027m inside.\u0027 Mahmeini\u0027s man turned and scanned the room, and thought about the red tail lights in the north, and turned back and asked, \u0027Are you sure?\u0027 The barman said, \u0027I don\u0027t want to be rude, sir, but really, if two of you had been in here tonight, someone would have called Homeland Security already. Don\u0027t you think?\u0027 Mahmeini\u0027s man said nothing. \u0027Just saying,\u0027 the barman said. \u0027This is Nebraska. There are military installations here.\u0027 Mahmeini\u0027s man asked, \u0027Then was someone else just here?\u0027 \u0027This is a bar, my friend. People are in and out all night long. That\u0027s kind of the point of the place.\u0027 The barman turned back to his current customer. Interaction over. Mahmeini\u0027s man turned and scanned the room, one more time. Then he gave it up and moved away, between the tables, back to the door. He stepped into the lot and took out his phone. No signal. He stood still for a second and glanced north at where the red lights had gone, and then he climbed back into the taxi. He closed the door against a yowling hinge and said, \u0027Thank you for waiting.\u0027 The driver looked back over his shoulder and asked, \u0027Where to now?\u0027 Mahmeini\u0027s man said, \u0027Let me think about that for a minute.\u0027 Reacher kept the Malibu at a steady sixty. A mile a minute. Hypnotic. Power line poles flashed past, the tyres sang, the motor hummed. Reacher took the fresh bottle of water from the cup holder and opened it and drank from it one-handed. He switched his headlights to bright. Nothing to see ahead of him. A straight road, then mist, then darkness. He checked the mirror. Nothing to see behind him. He checked the dials and the gauges. All good. Eleanor Duncan checked her watch. It was a small Rolex, a present from Seth, but probably real. She had counted ahead an hour and six minutes from when she had hung up the phone, and she had forty-five minutes still to go. She stepped out of the living room into the hallway, and stepped out of the hallway into her husband\u0027s den. It was a small square space. She had no idea of its original purpose. Maybe a gun room. Now it was set up as a home office, but with an emphasis on gentlemanly style, not clerical function. There was a club chair made of leather. The desk was yew. It had a light with a green glass shade. There were bookshelves. There was a rug. The air in the room smelled like Seth. There was a shallow glass bowl on the desk. From Murano, near Venice, in Italy. It was green. A souvenir. It had paperclips in it. And her car keys, just sitting there, two small serrated lances with big black heads. For her Mazda Miata. A tiny red two-seat convertible. A fun car. Carefree. Like the old British MGs and Lotuses used to be, but reliable. She took one of the keys. She stepped back to the hallway. Eleven miles. She thought she knew what Reacher had in mind. So she opened the coat closet and took out a silk headscarf. Pure white. She folded it into a triangle and tied it over her hair. She checked the mirror. Just like an old-fashioned movie star. Or an old-fashioned movie star after a knockout round with an old-fashioned heavyweight champion. She left by the back door and walked through the cold to the garage, Seth\u0027s empty bay to the right, hers in the middle, the doors all open. She got in her car and unlatched the clips above the windshield and dropped the top. She started up and backed out and turned and waited on the driveway, the motor running, the heater warming, her heart beating hard. She checked her watch. Twenty-nine minutes to go. Reacher cruised onward, sixty miles an hour, three more minutes, and then he slowed down and put his lights back on bright. He watched the right shoulder. The old abandoned roadhouse loomed up at him, right on cue, pinned and stark in his headlight beams. The bad roof, the beer signs on the walls behind the mud, the bruised earth all around where cars had once parked. He pulled off the road and into the lot. Loose stones popped and crunched and slithered under his tyres. He drove a full circuit. The building was long and low and plain, like a barn cut off at the knees. Rectangular, except for two separate square bump-outs added at the back, one at each end of the structure, the first for restrooms, probably, and the second for a kitchen. Efficient, in terms of plumbing lines. Between the bump-outs was a shallow U-shaped space, like a bay, empty apart from a little windblown trash, enclosed on three sides, open only to the dark empty fields to the east. It was maybe thirty feet long and twelve feet deep. Perfect, for later. Reacher came back around to the south gable wall and parked thirty feet from it, out of sight from the north, facing the road at a slight diagonal angle, like a cop on speed trap duty. He killed the lights and kept the motor running. He got out into the cold and looped around the hood and walked to the corner of the building. He leaned on the old boards. They felt thin and veined, frozen by a hundred winters, baked by a hundred summers. They smelled of dust and age. He watched the darkness in the north, where he knew the road must be. He waited. THIRTY-FIVE REACHER WAITED TWENTY LONG MINUTES, AND THEN HE SAW light in the north. Very faint, maybe five or six miles away, really just a high hemispherical glow in the mist, trembling a little, bouncing, weakening and strengthening and weakening again. A moving bubble of light. Very white. Almost blue. A car, coming south towards him, pretty fast. Eleanor Duncan, presumably, right on time. Reacher waited. Two minutes later she was two miles closer, and the high hemispherical glow was bigger, and stronger, still bouncing, still trembling, but now it had a strange asynchronous pulse inside it, the bouncing now going two ways at once, the strengthening and the weakening now random and out of phase. There were two cars on the road, not one. Reacher smiled. The sentry. The football player, posted to the south. A college graduate. Not a dumb guy. He knew his five buddies had been sent home to bed because absolutely nothing was going to happen. He knew he had been posted as a precaution only, just for the sake of it. He knew he was facing a long night of boredom, staring into the dark, no chance of glory. So what\u0027s a guy going to do, when Eleanor Duncan suddenly blasts past him from behind, in her little red sports car? He\u0027s going to see major brownie points on the table, that\u0027s what. He\u0027s going to give up on the blank hours ahead, and he\u0027s going to pull out and follow her, and he\u0027s going to dream of a promotion to the inner circle, and he\u0027s going to imagine a scene and he\u0027s going to rehearse a speech, because he\u0027s going to pull Seth Duncan aside tomorrow, first thing in the morning, very discreetly, like an old friend or a trusted aide, and he\u0027s going to whisper, Yes, sir, I followed her all the way and I can show you exactly where she went. Then he\u0027s going to add, No, sir, I told no one else, but I thought you should know. Then he\u0027s going to hop and shuffle in a modest and self-deprecating way and he\u0027s going to say, Well yes, sir, I thought it was much more important than sentry duty, and I\u0027m glad you agree I did the right thing. Reacher smiled again. Human nature. Reacher waited. Two more minutes, and the travelling bubble of light was another two miles closer, now much flatter and more elongated. Two cars, with some little distance between them. Predator and prey, some hundreds of yards apart. There was no red glow in the bubble. The football player\u0027s headlights were falling short of the Mazda\u0027s paint. The guy was maybe a quarter of a mile back, following the Mazda\u0027s tail lights, no doubt thinking he was doing a hell of a job of staying inconspicuous. Maybe not such a smart guy. The Mazda had a mirror, and halogen headlights on a Nebraska winter night were probably visible from outer space. Reacher moved. He pushed off the corner of the building and looped around the Malibu\u0027s hood and got in the driver\u0027s seat. He locked the selector in first gear and put his left foot hard on the brake and his right foot on the gas. He goosed the pedal until the transmission was straining against the brake and the whole car was wound up tight and ready to launch. He kept one hand on the wheel and the other on the headlight switch. He waited. Sixty seconds. Ninety seconds. Then the Mazda flashed past, right to left, instantaneously, a tiny dark shape chasing a huge pool of bright light, its top down, a woman in a headscarf at the wheel, all chased in turn by tyre roar and engine noise and the red flare of tail lights. Then it was gone. Reacher counted one and flicked his headlights on and took his foot off the brake and stamped on the gas and shot forward and braked hard and stopped again sideways across the crown of the road. He wrenched open the door and spilled out and danced back towards the Malibu\u0027s trunk, towards the shoulder he had just left. Two hundred yards to his right a big SUV was starting a panic stop. Its headlights flared yellow against the Malibu\u0027s paint and then they nosedived into the blacktop as the truck\u0027s front suspension crushed under the force of violent braking. Huge tyres howled and the truck lost its line and slewed to its right and went into a four-wheel slide and its nearside wheels tucked under and its high centre of gravity tipped over and its offside wheels came up in the air. Then they crashed back to earth and the rear end fishtailed violently a full ninety degrees and the truck snapped around and came to rest parallel with the Malibu, less than ten feet away, stalled out and silent, the scream of stressed rubber dying away, thin drifts of moving blue smoke following it and catching it and stopping and rising all around it and billowing away into the cold night air. Reacher pulled the Iranian\u0027s Glock from his pocket and stormed the driver\u0027s door and wrenched it open and danced back and pointed the gun. In general he was not a big fan of dramatic arrests, but he knew from long experience what worked and what didn\u0027t with shocked and unpredictable subjects, so he screamed GET OUT OF THE CAR GET OUT OF THE CAR GET OUT OF THE CAR as loud as he could, which was plenty loud, and the guy behind the wheel more or less tumbled out, and then Reacher was on him, forcing him down, flipping him, jamming him face down into the blacktop, his knee in the small of the guy\u0027s back, the Glock\u0027s muzzle hard in the back of the guy\u0027s neck, all the time screaming STAY DOWN STAY DOWN STAY DOWN, all the while watching the sky over his shoulder for more lights. There were no more lights. No one else was coming. No backup. The guy hadn\u0027t called it in. He was planning a solo enterprise. All the glory for himself. As expected. Reacher smiled. Human nature. The scene went quiet. Nothing to hear, except the Malibu\u0027s patient idle. Nothing to see, except four high beams stabbing the far shoulder. The air was full of the smell of burned rubber and hot brakes, and gas, and oil. The Cornhusker lay completely still. Hard not to, with 250 pounds on his back, and a gun to his head, and television images of SWAT arrests in his mind. Maybe real images. Country boys get arrested from time to time, the same as anyone else. And things had happened fast, all dark and noise and blur and panic, enough that maybe the guy hadn\u0027t really seen Reacher\u0027s face yet, or recognized his description from the Duncans\u0027 warnings. Maybe the guy hadn\u0027t put two and two together. Maybe he was waiting it out like a civilian, waiting to explain to a cop that he was innocent, like people do. Which gave Reacher a minor problem. He was about to transition away from what the guy might have taken to be a legitimate law enforcement takedown, straight to what the guy was going to know for sure was a wholly illegitimate kidnap attempt. And the guy was big. Six-six or a little more, two-ninety or a little more. He had on a large red football jacket and baggy jeans. His feet were the size of boats. Reacher said, \u0027Tell me your name.\u0027 The guy\u0027s chin and his lips and his nose were all jammed hard down on the blacktop. He said, \u0027John,\u0027 like a gasp, like a grunt, just a soft expulsion of breath, quiet and indistinct. \u0027Not Brett?\u0027 Reacher asked. \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s good.\u0027 Reacher shifted his weight, turned the guy\u0027s head, jammed the Glock in his ear, saw the whites of his eyes. \u0027Do you know who I am?\u0027 The guy on the ground said, \u0027I do now.\u0027 \u0027You know the two things you really need to understand?\u0027 \u0027What are they?\u0027 \u0027Whoever you think you are, I\u0027m tougher than you, and I\u0027m more ruthless than you. You have absolutely no idea. I\u0027m worse than your worst nightmare. Do you believe that?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Really believe it? Like you believe in mom and apple pie?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027You know what I did to your buddies?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027What did I do?\u0027 \u0027You finished them.\u0027 \u0027Correct. But here\u0027s the thing, John. I\u0027m prepared to work with you, to save your life. We can do this, if we try. But if you step half an inch out of line, I\u0027ll kill you and walk away and I\u0027ll never think about you again and I\u0027ll sleep like a baby the whole rest of my life. We clear on that?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027So you want to try?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Are you thinking about some stupid move? Are you quarter-backing it right now? You planning to wait until my attention wanders?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027Good answer, John. Because my attention never wanders. You ever seen someone get shot?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s not like the movies, John. Big chunks of disgusting stuff come flying out. Even a flesh wound, you never really recover. Not a hundred per cent. You get infections. You\u0027re weak and hurting, for ever.\u0027 \u0027OK.\u0027 \u0027So stand up now.\u0027 Reacher got up out of his crouch and moved away, pointing the gun, aiming it two-handed at arm\u0027s length for theatrical effect, tracking the guy\u0027s head, a big pale target. First the guy went foetal for a second, and then he gathered himself and got his hands under him and jacked himself to his knees. Reacher said, \u0027See the yellow car? You\u0027re going to go stand next to the driver\u0027s door.\u0027 The guy said, \u0027OK,\u0027 and got to his feet, a little unsteady at first, then firmer, taller, squarer. Reacher said, \u0027Feeling good now, John? Feeling brave? Getting ready? Going to rush over and get me?\u0027 The guy said, \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027Good answer, John. I\u0027ll put a double tap in you before you move the first muscle. Believe me, I\u0027ve done it before. I used to get paid to do it. I\u0027m very good at it. So move over to the yellow car and stand next to the driver\u0027s door.\u0027 Reacher tracked him all the way around the Malibu\u0027s hood. The driver\u0027s door was still open. Reacher had left it that way, for the sake of a speedy exit. The guy stood in its angle. Reacher aimed the gun across the roof of the car and opened the passenger door. The two men stood there, one on each side, both doors open like little wings. Reacher said, \u0027Now get in.\u0027 The guy ducked and bent and slid into the seat. Reacher backed off a step and aimed the gun down inside the car, a low trajectory, straight at the guy\u0027s hips and thighs. He said, \u0027Don\u0027t touch the wheel. Don\u0027t touch the pedals. Don\u0027t put your seat belt on.\u0027 The guy sat still, with his hands in his lap. Reacher said, \u0027Now close your door.\u0027 The guy closed his door. Reacher asked, \u0027Feeling heroic yet, John?\u0027 The guy said, \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027Good answer, my friend. We can do this. Just remember, the Chevrolet Malibu is an OK mid-range product, especially for Detroit, but it doesn\u0027t accelerate for shit. Not like a bullet, anyway. This gun of mine is full of nine-millimetre Parabellums. They come out of the barrel doing nine hundred miles an hour. Think a four-cylinder GM motor can outrun that?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027Good, John,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027I\u0027m glad to see all that education didn\u0027t go to waste.\u0027 Then he looked up across the roof of the car, and he saw light in the mist to the south. A high hemispherical glow, trembling a little, bouncing, weakening and strengthening and weakening again. Very white. Almost blue. A car, coming north towards him, pretty fast.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-dying-for-jack-reacher-15/page-15.html","bookId":2348,"book":{"id":2348,"title":"Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher #15)","description":"Storyline: Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher #15) There’s deadly trouble in the corn county of Nebraska . . . and Jack Reacher walks right into it.
