{"id":66443,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"FIFTEEN\n REACHER WAS HALF EXPECTING SOMETHING NAILED TOGETHER from sod and rotten boards, like a Dust Bowl photograph, but the woman drove him down a long gravel farm track to a neat two-storey dwelling standing alone in the corner of a spread that might have covered a thousand acres. The woman parked behind the house, next to a line of old tumbledown barns and sheds. Reacher could hear chickens in a coop, and he could smell pigs in a sty. And earth, and air, and weather. The countryside, in all its winter glory. The woman said, \u0027I don\u0027t mean to be rude, but how much are you planning to pay me?\u0027\n Reacher smiled. \u0027Deciding how much food to give me?\u0027\n \u0027Something like that.\u0027\n \u0027My breakfast average west of the Mississippi is about fifteen bucks with tip.\u0027\n The woman looked surprised. And satisfied.\n \u0027That\u0027s a lot of money,\u0027 she said. \u0027That\u0027s two hours\u0027 wages. That\u0027s like having a nine-day work week.\u0027\n \u0027Not all profit,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027I\u0027m hungry, don\u0027t forget.\u0027\n She led him inside through a door to a back hallway. The house was what Seth Duncan\u0027s place might have been before the expensive renovations. Low ceilings overhead, small panes of wavy glass in the windows, uneven floors underfoot, the whole place old and antique and outdated in every possible way, but cleaned and tidied and well maintained for a hundred consecutive years. The kitchen was immaculate. The stove was cold.\n \u0027You didn\u0027t eat yet?\u0027 Reacher asked.\n \u0027I don\u0027t eat,\u0027 the woman said. \u0027Not breakfast, at least.\u0027\n \u0027Dieting?\u0027\n The woman didn\u0027t answer, and Reacher immediately felt stupid.\n \u0027I\u0027m buying,\u0027 he said. \u0027Thirty bucks. Let\u0027s both have some fun.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t want charity.\u0027\n \u0027It isn\u0027t charity. I\u0027m returning a favour, that\u0027s all. You stuck your neck out bringing me here.\u0027\n \u0027I was just trying to be a decent person.\u0027\n \u0027Me too,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027Take it or leave it.\u0027\n She said, \u0027I\u0027ll take it.\u0027\n He said, \u0027What\u0027s your name? Most times when I have breakfast with a lady, I know her name at least.\u0027\n \u0027My name is Dorothy.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m pleased to meet you, Dorothy. You married?\u0027\n \u0027I was. Now I\u0027m not.\u0027\n \u0027You know my name?\u0027\n \u0027Your name is Jack Reacher. We\u0027ve all been informed. The word is out.\u0027\n \u0027I told the doctor\u0027s wife.\u0027\n \u0027And she told the Duncans. Don\u0027t blame her for it. It\u0027s automatic. She\u0027s trying to pay down her debt, like all of us.\u0027\n \u0027What does she owe them?\u0027\n \u0027She sided with me, twenty-five years ago.\u0027\n Roberto Cassano and Angelo Mancini were driving north in a rented Impala. They were based in a Courtyard Marriott, which was the only hotel in the county seat, which was nothing more than a token grid of streets set in the middle of what felt like a billion square miles of absolutely nothing at all. They had learned to watch their fuel gauge. Nebraska was that kind of place. It paid to fill up at every gas station you saw. The next one could be a million miles away.\n They were from Vegas, which as always meant they were really from somewhere else. New York, in Cassano\u0027s case, and Philadelphia, in Mancini\u0027s. They had paid their dues in their home towns, and then they had gotten hired together in Miami, like playing triple-A ball, and then they had moved up to the big show out in the Nevada desert. Tourists were told that what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, but that wasn\u0027t true as far as Cassano and Mancini were concerned. They were travelling men, always on the move, tasked to roam around and deal with the first faint pre-echoes of trouble long before it rolled in and hit their boss where he lived.\n Hence the trip to the vast agricultural wastelands, nearly eight hundred miles north and east of the glitter and the glamour. There was a snafu in the supply chain, and it was a day or two away from getting extremely embarrassing. Their boss had promised certain specific things to certain specific people, and it would do him no good at all if he couldn\u0027t deliver. So Cassano and Mancini had so far been on the scene for seventy-two hours straight, and they had smacked some beanpole yokel\u0027s wife around, just to make their point. Then some other related yokel had called with a claim that the snafu was being caused by a stranger poking his nose in where it didn\u0027t belong. Bullshit, possibly. Quite probably entirely unconnected. Just an excuse. But Cassano and Mancini were only sixty miles away, so their boss was sending them north to help, because if the yokel\u0027s statement was indeed a lie, then it indicated vulnerability, and therefore minor assistance rendered now would leverage a better deal later. An obvious move. This was American business, after all. Forcing down the wholesale price was the name of the game.\n They came up the crappy two-lane and rolled through the crappy crossroads and pulled in at the motel. They had seen it before. It looked OK at night. Not so good in the daylight. In the daylight it looked sad and botched and half-hearted. They saw a damaged Subaru standing near one of the cabins. It was all smashed up. There was nothing else to see. They parked in the lot outside the lounge and got out of the rental car and stood and stretched. Two city boys, yawning, scoured by the endless wind. Cassano was medium height, dark, muscled, blank-eyed. Mancini was pretty much the same. They both wore good shoes and dark suits and coloured shirts and no ties and wool overcoats. They were often mistaken for each other.\n They went inside, to find the motel owner. Which they did, immediately. They found him behind the bar, using a rag, wiping a bunch of sticky overlapping rings off the wood. Some kind of a sadsack loser, with dyed red hair.\n Cassano said, \u0027We represent the Duncan family,\u0027 which he had been promised would produce results. And it did. The guy with the hair dropped the rag and stepped back and almost came to attention and saluted, like he was in the army, like a superior officer had just yelled at him.\n Cassano said, \u0027You sheltered a guy here last night.\u0027\n The guy with the hair said, \u0027No, sir, I did not. I tossed him out.\u0027\n Mancini said, \u0027It\u0027s cold.\u0027\n The guy behind the bar said nothing, not following.\n Cassano said, \u0027If he didn\u0027t sleep here, where the hell did he sleep? You got no local competition. And he didn\u0027t sleep out under a hedge. For one thing, there don\u0027t seem to be any hedges in Nebraska. For another, he\u0027d have frozen his ass off.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know where he went.\u0027\n \u0027You sure?\u0027\n \u0027He wouldn\u0027t tell me.\u0027\n \u0027Any kindly souls here, who would take a stranger in?\u0027\n \u0027Not if the Duncans told them not to.\u0027\n \u0027Then he must have stayed here.\u0027\n \u0027Sir, I told you, he didn\u0027t.\u0027\n \u0027You checked his room?\u0027\n \u0027He returned the key before he left.\u0027\n \u0027More than one way into a room, asshole. Did you check it?\u0027\n \u0027The housekeeper already made it up.\u0027\n \u0027She say anything?\u0027\n \u0027No.\u0027\n \u0027Where is she?\u0027\n \u0027She finished. She left. She went home.\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s her name?\u0027\n \u0027Dorothy.\u0027\n Mancini said, \u0027Tell us where Dorothy lives.\u0027\n SIXTEEN\n DOROTHY\u0027S IDEA OF A FIFTEEN-DOLLAR BREAKFAST TURNED OUT to be a regular feast. Coffee first, while the rest of it was cooking, which was oatmeal, and bacon, and eggs, and toast, big heaping portions, lots of everything, all the food groups, all piping hot, served on thick china plates that must have been fifty years old, and eaten with ancient silverware that had heavy square Georgian handles.\n \u0027Fabulous,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027Thank you very much.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re welcome. Thank you for mine.\u0027\n \u0027It isn\u0027t right, you know. People not eating because of the Duncans.\u0027\n \u0027People do all kinds of things because of the Duncans.\u0027\n \u0027I know what I\u0027d do.\u0027\n She smiled. \u0027We all talked like that, once upon a time, long ago. But they kept us poor and tired, and then we got old.\u0027\n \u0027What do the young people do here?\u0027\n \u0027They leave, just as soon as they can. The adventurous ones go all over the place. It\u0027s a big country. The others stay closer to home, in Lincoln or Omaha.\u0027\n \u0027Doing what?\u0027\n \u0027There are jobs there. Some boys join the State Police. That\u0027s always popular.\u0027\n \u0027Someone should call those boys.\u0027\n She didn\u0027t answer.\n He asked, \u0027What happened twenty-five years ago?\u0027\n \u0027I can\u0027t talk about it.\u0027\n \u0027You can, to me. No one will know. If I ever meet the Duncans, we\u0027ll be discussing the present day, not ancient history.\u0027\n \u0027I was wrong anyway.\u0027\n \u0027About what?\u0027\n She wouldn\u0027t answer.\n He asked, \u0027Were you the neighbour with the dispute?\u0027\n She wouldn\u0027t answer.\n He asked, \u0027You want help cleaning up?\u0027\n She shook her head. \u0027You don\u0027t wash the dishes in a restaurant, do you?\u0027\n \u0027Not so far.\u0027\n \u0027Where were you, twenty-five years ago?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t remember,\u0027 he said. \u0027Somewhere in the world.\u0027\n \u0027Were you in the army then?\u0027\n \u0027Probably.\u0027\n \u0027People say you beat up three Cornhuskers yesterday.\u0027\n \u0027Not all at once,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027You want more coffee?\u0027\n \u0027Sure,\u0027 he said, and she recharged the percolator and set it going again. He asked, \u0027How many farms contracted with the Duncans?\u0027\n \u0027All of us,\u0027 she said. \u0027This whole corner of the county. Forty farms.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s a lot of corn.\u0027\n \u0027And soybeans and alfalfa. We rotate the crops.\u0027\n \u0027Did you buy part of the old Duncan place?\u0027\n \u0027A hundred acres. A nice little parcel. It squared off a corner. It made sense.\u0027\n \u0027How long ago was that?\u0027\n \u0027It must be thirty years.\u0027\n \u0027So things were good for the first five years?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m not going to tell you what happened.\u0027\n \u0027I think you should,\u0027 he said. \u0027I think you want to.\u0027\n \u0027Why do you want to know?\u0027\n \u0027Like you said, I had three football players sent after me. I\u0027d like to understand why, at least.\u0027\n \u0027It was because you busted Seth Duncan\u0027s nose.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve busted lots of noses. Nobody ever retaliated with retired athletes before.\u0027\n She poured the coffee. She placed his mug in front of him. The kitchen was warm from the stove. It felt like it would stay warm all day long. She said, \u0027Twenty-five years ago Seth Duncan was eight years old.\u0027\n \u0027And?\u0027\n \u0027This corner of the county was like a little community. We were all spread out and isolated, of course, but the school bus kind of defined it. Everybody knew everybody else. Children would play together, big groups of them, at one house, then another.\u0027\n \u0027And?\u0027\n \u0027No one liked going to Seth Duncan\u0027s place. Girls especially. And Seth played with girls a lot. More so than with boys.\u0027\n \u0027Why didn\u0027t they like it?\u0027\n \u0027No one spelled it out. A place like this, a time like that, such things were not discussed. But something unpleasant was going on. Or nearly going on. Or in the air. My daughter was eight years old at the time. Same age as Seth. Almost the same birthday, as a matter of fact. She didn\u0027t want to play there. She made that clear.\u0027\n \u0027What was going on?\u0027\n \u0027I told you, no one said.\u0027\n \u0027But you knew,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027Didn\u0027t you? You had a daughter. Maybe you couldn\u0027t prove anything, but you knew.\u0027\n \u0027Have you got kids?\u0027\n \u0027None that I know about. But I was a cop of sorts for thirteen years. And I\u0027ve been human all my life. Sometimes people just know things.\u0027\n The woman nodded. Sixty years old, blunt and square, her face flushed from the heat and the food. She said, \u0027I suppose today they would call it inappropriate touching.\u0027\n \u0027On Seth\u0027s part?\u0027\n She nodded again. \u0027And his father\u0027s, and both his uncles\u0027.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s awful.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, it was.\u0027\n \u0027What did you do?\u0027\n \u0027My daughter never went there again.\u0027\n \u0027Did you talk to people?\u0027\n \u0027Not at first,\u0027 she said. \u0027Then it all came out in a rush. Everyone was talking to everyone else. Nobody\u0027s girl wanted to go there.\u0027\n \u0027Did anyone talk to Seth\u0027s mother?\u0027\n \u0027Seth didn\u0027t have a mother.\u0027\n Reacher said, \u0027Why not? Had she left?\u0027\n \u0027No.\u0027\n \u0027Had she died?\u0027\n \u0027She never existed.\u0027\n \u0027She must have.\u0027\n \u0027Biologically, I suppose. But Jacob Duncan was never married. He was never seen with a woman. No woman was ever seen with any of them. Their own mother had passed on years before. It was just old man Duncan and the three of them. Then the three of them on their own. Then all of a sudden Jacob was bringing a little boy to kindergarten.\u0027\n \u0027Didn\u0027t anyone ask where the kid came from?\u0027\n \u0027People talked a little, but they didn\u0027t ask. Too polite. Too inhibited. I suppose we all thought Seth was a relative. You know, maybe orphaned or something.\u0027\n \u0027So what happened next? You all stopped your kids from going there to play, and that\u0027s what caused the trouble?\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s how it started. There was a lot of talk and whispers. The Duncans were all alone in their little compound. They were shunned. They resented it.\u0027\n \u0027So they retaliated?\u0027\n \u0027Not at first.\u0027\n \u0027So when?\u0027\n \u0027After a little girl went missing.\u0027\n Roberto Cassano and Angelo Mancini got back in their rented Impala and fired up the engine. The car had a bolt-on navigation system, a couple of extra dollars a day, but it was useless. The screen came up with nothing more than a few thin red lines, like doodles on a pad. None of the roads had names. Just numbers, or else nothing at all. Most of the map was blank. And it was either inaccurate or incomplete, anyway. The crossroads wasn\u0027t even marked. Just like Vegas, to be honest. Vegas was growing so fast no GPS company could keep up with it. So Cassano and Mancini were used to navigating the old-fashioned way, which was to scribble down turn-by-turn directions freely given by a source who was anxious to be accurate, in order to avoid a worse beating than he was getting along with the initial questions. And the motel guy had been more anxious than most, right after the first two smacks. He was no kind of hero. That was for sure.\n \u0027Left out of the lot,\u0027 Mancini read out loud.\n Cassano turned left out of the lot.\n Dorothy the housekeeper made a third pot of coffee. She rinsed the percolator and filled it again and set it going. She said, \u0027Seth Duncan had a hard time in school. He got bullied. Eight-year-old boys can be very tribal. I guess they felt they had permission to go after him, because of the whispers at home. And none of the girls stuck with him. They wouldn\u0027t go to his house, and they wouldn\u0027t even talk to him. That\u0027s how children are. That\u0027s how it was. All except one girl. Her parents had raised her to be decent and compassionate. She wouldn\u0027t go to his house, but she still talked to him. Then one day that little girl just disappeared.\u0027\n Reacher said, \u0027And?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s a horrible thing, when that happens. You have no idea. There\u0027s a kind of crazy period at first, when everyone is mad and worried but can\u0027t bring themselves to believe the worst. You know, a couple of hours, maybe three or four, you think she\u0027s playing somewhere, maybe out picking flowers, she\u0027s lost track of the time, she\u0027ll be home soon, right as rain. No one had cell phones back then, of course. Some people didn\u0027t even have regular phones. Then you think the girl has gotten lost, and everyone starts driving around, looking for her. Then it goes dark, and then you call the cops.\u0027\n Reacher asked, \u0027What did the cops do?\u0027\n \u0027Everything they could. They did a fine job. They went house to house, they used flashlights, they used loudhailers to tell everyone to search their barns and outbuildings, they drove around all night, then at first light they got dogs and called in the State Police and the State Police called in the National Guard and they got a helicopter.\u0027\n \u0027Nothing?\u0027\n The woman nodded.\n \u0027Nothing,\u0027 she said. \u0027Then I told them about the Duncans.\u0027\n \u0027You did?\u0027\n \u0027Someone had to. As soon as I spoke up, others joined in. We were all pointing our fingers. The State Police took us very seriously. I guess they couldn\u0027t afford not to. They took the Duncans to a barracks over near Lincoln and questioned them for days. They searched their houses. They got help from the FBI. All kinds of laboratory people were there.\u0027\n \u0027Did they find anything?\u0027\n \u0027Not a trace.\u0027\n \u0027Nothing at all?\u0027\n \u0027Every test was negative. They said the child hadn\u0027t been there.\u0027\n \u0027So what happened next?\u0027\n \u0027Nothing. It all fizzled out. The Duncans came home. The little girl was never seen again. The case was never solved. The Duncans were very bitter. They asked me to apologize, for naming names, but I wouldn\u0027t. I couldn\u0027t give it up. My husband, neither. Some folks were on our side, like the doctor\u0027s wife. But most weren\u0027t, really. They saw which way the wind was blowing. The Duncans withdrew into themselves. Then they started punishing us. Like revenge. We didn\u0027t get our crop hauled that year. We lost it all. My husband killed himself. He sat right in that chair where you\u0027re sitting and he put his shotgun under his chin.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry.\u0027\n The woman said nothing.\n Reacher asked, \u0027Who was the girl?\u0027\n No reply.\n \u0027Yours, right?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 the woman said. \u0027It was my daughter. She was eight years old. She\u0027ll always be eight years old.\u0027\n She started to cry, and then her phone started to ring. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-dying-for-jack-reacher-15/page-6.html","bookId":2348,"book":{"id":2348,"title":"Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher #15)","description":"Storyline: \n Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher #15) \n There’s deadly trouble in the corn county of Nebraska . . . and Jack Reacher walks right into it.
