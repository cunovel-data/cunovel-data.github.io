{"id":66453,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"THIRTY-SIX THE ONCOMING CAR WAS ABOUT TWO MILES AWAY. DOING ABOUT sixty, Reacher figured. Sixty was about all the road was good for. Two minutes. He said, \u0027Sit tight, John. Stop thinking. This is your time of maximum danger. I\u0027m going to play it very safe. I\u0027ll shoot first and ask questions later. Don\u0027t think I won\u0027t.\u0027 The guy sat still behind the Malibu\u0027s wheel. Reacher watched across the roof of the car. The bubble of light in the south was still moving, still bouncing and trembling and strengthening and weakening, but coherently this time, naturally, in phase. Just one car. Now about a mile away. One minute. Reacher waited. The glow resolved itself to a fierce source low down above the blacktop, then twin fierce sources spaced feet apart, both of them oval in shape, both of them low to the ground, both of them blue-white and intense. They kept on coming, flickering and floating and jittering ahead of a firm front suspension and fast go-kart steering, at first small because of the distance, and then small because they were small, because they were mounted low down on a small low car, because the car was a Mazda Miata, tiny, red in colour, slowing now, coming to a stop, its headlights unbearably bright against the Malibu\u0027s yellow paint. Then Eleanor Duncan killed her lights and manoeuvred around the Malibu\u0027s trunk, half on the road and half on the shoulder, and came to a stop with her elbow on the door and her head turned towards Reacher. She asked, \u0027Did I do it right?\u0027 Reacher said, \u0027You did it perfectly. The headscarf was a great touch.\u0027 \u0027I decided against sunglasses. Too much of a risk at night.\u0027 \u0027Probably.\u0027 \u0027But you took a risk. That\u0027s for sure. You could have gotten creamed here.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s an athlete. And young. Good eyesight, good hand-eye coordination, lots of fast-twitch muscles. I figured I\u0027d have time to jump clear.\u0027 \u0027Even so. He could have wrecked both vehicles. Then what would you have done?\u0027 \u0027Plan B was shoot him and ride back with you.\u0027 She was quiet for a second. Then she said, \u0027Need anything else?\u0027 \u0027No, thanks. Go on home now.\u0027 \u0027This guy will tell Seth, you know. About what I did.\u0027 \u0027He won\u0027t,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027He and I are going to work something out.\u0027 Eleanor Duncan said nothing more. She just put her lights back on and her car in gear and drove away, fast and crisp, the sound of her exhaust ripping the night air behind her. Reacher glanced back twice, once when she was half a mile away and again when she was gone altogether. Then he slid into the Malibu\u0027s passenger seat, alongside the guy called John, and closed his door. He held the Glock right-handed across his body. He said, \u0027Now you\u0027re going to park this car around the back of this old roadhouse. If the speedo gets above five miles an hour, I\u0027m going to shoot you in the side. Without immediate medical attention you\u0027ll live about twenty minutes. Then you\u0027ll die, in hideous agony. Believe me, I\u0027ve seen it happen. Truth is, John, I\u0027ve made it happen, more than once. We clear?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Say it, John. Say we\u0027re clear.\u0027 \u0027We\u0027re clear.\u0027 \u0027How clear are we?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know what you want me to say.\u0027 \u0027I want you to say we\u0027re crystal clear.\u0027 \u0027You got it. Crystal.\u0027 \u0027OK, so let\u0027s do it.\u0027 The guy fumbled the lever into gear and turned the wheel and drove a wide circle, painfully slow, bumping up on the far shoulder, coming around to the near shoulder, bumping down on to the beaten earth of the old lot, passing the south gable wall, turning sharply behind the building. Reacher said, \u0027Pull ahead and then back in, between the two bump-outs, like parallel parking. Do they ask for that in the Nebraska test?\u0027 The guy said, \u0027I passed in Kentucky. In high school.\u0027 \u0027Does that mean you need me to explain it to you?\u0027 \u0027I know how to do it.\u0027 \u0027OK, show me.\u0027 The guy pulled ahead of the second square bump-out and lined up and backed into the shallow U-shaped bay. Reacher said, \u0027All the way, now. I want the back bumper hard against the wood and I want your side of the car hard against the building. I want you to trash your door mirror, John. Totally trash it. Can you do that for me?\u0027 The guy paused and then turned the wheel harder. He did pretty well. He got the rear bumper hard against the bump-out and he trashed his door mirror good, but he left about an inch between his flank of the car and the back of the building. He checked behind him, checked left, and then looked at Reacher like he was expecting praise. \u0027Close enough,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027Now shut it down.\u0027 The guy killed the lights and turned off the motor. Reacher said, \u0027Leave the key.\u0027 The guy said, \u0027I can\u0027t get out. I can\u0027t open my door.\u0027 Reacher said, \u0027Crawl out after me.\u0027 He opened his own door and slid out and backed off and stood tall and aimed the gun two-handed. The guy came out after him, hands and knees, huge and awkward, feet first, butt high up in the air. He got straight and turned around and said, \u0027Want me to close the door?\u0027 Reacher said, \u0027You\u0027re thinking again, aren\u0027t you, John? You\u0027re thinking it\u0027s dark out here, now the lights are off, and maybe I can\u0027t see too well. You\u0027re figuring maybe this would be a good time. But it isn\u0027t. I can see just fine. An owl has got nothing on me in the eyesight department, John. An owl with night-vision goggles sees worse. Believe it, kid. Just hang in there. You can get through this.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not thinking anything,\u0027 the guy said. \u0027So close the door.\u0027 The guy closed the door. \u0027Now step away from the car.\u0027 The guy stepped away. The car was crammed tight in the back southwest quarter of the shallow bay, occupying a fifteen-by-six footprint within the total thirty-by-twelve space. It would be invisible from the road, either north or south, and no one was going to be in the fields to the east until spring ploughing. Safe enough. Reacher said, \u0027Now move to your right.\u0027 \u0027Where?\u0027 \u0027So when I aim the gun at you I\u0027m aiming parallel with the road.\u0027 The guy moved, two steps, three, and then he stopped and turned and faced front, with his back to the forty empty miles between him and the Cell Block bar. Reacher asked him, \u0027How close is the nearest house?\u0027 He said, \u0027Miles away.\u0027 \u0027Close enough to hear a gunshot in the night?\u0027 \u0027Maybe.\u0027 \u0027What would they think if they did?\u0027 \u0027Varmint. This is farm country.\u0027 Reacher said, \u0027I\u0027d be happier if you heard the gun go off, John. At least once. I\u0027d be happier if you knew what it was like to have a bullet coming your way. It might help you with all that thinking. It might help you reach sensible conclusions.\u0027 \u0027I won\u0027t try anything.\u0027 \u0027Do I have your word on that?\u0027 \u0027Absolutely.\u0027 \u0027So we\u0027re bonded now, John. I\u0027m trusting you. Am I wise to do that?\u0027 \u0027Absolutely.\u0027 \u0027OK, turn around and walk back to your truck.\u0027 Reacher kept ten feet behind the guy all the way, around the back corner of the building, along the face of the south gable wall, across the old lot, back to the two-lane. Reacher said, \u0027Now get in the truck the same way you got out of the car.\u0027 The guy closed the driver\u0027s door and tracked around the hood and opened the passenger door. Reacher watched him all the way. The guy climbed into the passenger seat and lifted his feet one at a time into the driver\u0027s foot well, and then he jacked himself up and over the console between the seats, on the heels of his hands, squirming, scraping, ducking his head. Reacher watched him all the way. When he was settled Reacher climbed into the passenger seat and closed the door. He swapped the gun into his left hand for a second and put his seat belt on. Then he swapped the gun back to his right and said, \u0027I\u0027ve got my seat belt on, John, but you\u0027re not going to put yours on, OK? Just in case you\u0027re getting ideas. Just in case you\u0027re thinking about driving into a telephone pole. See the point? You do that, and I\u0027ll be fine, but you\u0027ll be hurt bad, and then I\u0027ll shoot you anyway. We clear on that?\u0027 The guy said, \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Say it, John.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m clear on that.\u0027 \u0027How clear?\u0027 \u0027Crystal.\u0027 \u0027And we\u0027re bonded, right? I have your word, don\u0027t I?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Promise?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Where do you live?\u0027 \u0027At the Duncan Transportation depot.\u0027 \u0027Where is that?\u0027 \u0027From here? About thirty miles, give or take, north and then west.\u0027 \u0027OK, John,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027Take me there.\u0027 THIRTY-SEVEN MAHMEINI\u0027S MAN WAS IN HIS ROOM AT THE COURTYARD Marriott. He was on the phone with Mahmeini himself. The conversation had not started well. Mahmeini had been reluctant to accept that Sepehr had lit out. It was inconceivable to him. It was like being told the guy had grown a third arm. Just not humanly possible. Mahmeini\u0027s man said, \u0027He definitely wasn\u0027t in the bar.\u0027 \u0027By the time you got there.\u0027 \u0027He was never there. It was a most unpleasant place. I didn\u0027t like it at all. They looked at me like I was dirt. Like I was a terrorist. I doubt if they would even have served me. Asghar wouldn\u0027t have lasted five minutes without getting in a fight. And there was no sign of trouble. There was no blood on the floor. Which there would have been. Asghar is armed, and he\u0027s fast, and he doesn\u0027t suffer fools gladly.\u0027 Mahmeini said, \u0027Then he went somewhere else.\u0027 \u0027I checked all over town. Which didn\u0027t take long. The sidewalks roll up when it gets dark. There\u0027s nowhere to hide. He isn\u0027t here.\u0027 \u0027Women?\u0027 \u0027Are you kidding me? Here?\u0027 \u0027Did you try his phone again?\u0027 \u0027Over and over.\u0027 There was a long, long pause. Mahmeini, in his Las Vegas office, processing data, changing gears, improvising. He said, \u0027OK, let\u0027s move on. This business is important. It has to be taken care of tomorrow. So you\u0027ll have to manage on your own. You can do that. You\u0027re good enough.\u0027 \u0027But I don\u0027t have a car.\u0027 \u0027Get a ride from Safir\u0027s boys.\u0027 \u0027I thought of that. But the dynamic would be weird. I wouldn\u0027t be in charge. I would be a passenger, literally. And how would I explain why I let Asghar take off somewhere and leave me high and dry? We can\u0027t afford to look like idiots here. Or weak. Not in front of these people.\u0027 \u0027So get another car. Tell the others you told Asghar to go on ahead, or somewhere else entirely, for some other purpose.\u0027 \u0027Get another car? From where?\u0027 Mahmeini said, \u0027Rent one.\u0027 \u0027Boss, this isn\u0027t Vegas. They don\u0027t even have room service here. The nearest Hertz is back at the airport. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s closed until the morning. And I can\u0027t get there anyway.\u0027 Another long, long pause. Mahmeini, recalibrating, re-evaluating, reassessing, planning on the fly. He asked, \u0027Did the others see the first car you were in?\u0027 His guy said, \u0027No. I\u0027m sure they didn\u0027t. We all arrived separately, at different times.\u0027 Mahmeini said, \u0027OK. You\u0027re right about the dynamic. We need to be visibly in charge. And we need to keep the others off balance. So here\u0027s what you\u0027re going to do. Find a suitable car, within the hour. Steal one, if you have to. Then call the others, in their rooms. I don\u0027t care what time it is. Midnight, one o\u0027clock, whatever. Tell them we\u0027ve decided to start the party early. Tell them you\u0027re leaving for the north immediately. Give them five minutes, or you\u0027re going without them. They\u0027ll be in disarray, packing up and running down to the parking lot. You\u0027ll be waiting in your new car. But they won\u0027t know it\u0027s new. And they won\u0027t even notice that Asghar isn\u0027t with you. Not in the dark. Not in all the confusion. Then drive fast. Like a bat out of hell. Be the first one up there. When the others get there, tell them you turned Asghar loose, on foot, behind the lines. That will worry them. It will keep them even more off balance. They\u0027ll be looking over their shoulders all the time. That\u0027s it. That\u0027s what you\u0027re going to do. That\u0027s pretty much a silk purse out of a sow\u0027s ear, wouldn\u0027t you say?\u0027 Mahmeini\u0027s man put his coat on and carried his bag down to the lobby. The desk guy had gone off duty. Presumably there was an all-purpose night porter holed up in a back room somewhere, but Mahmeini\u0027s man didn\u0027t see any sign of him. He just walked out, bag in hand, looking for a car to steal. Which in many ways was a backward step and an affront to his dignity. Guys in his position had left car theft behind a long time ago. But, needs must. And he still remembered how. There would be no technical difficulty. He would perform with his usual precision. The difficulty would come from being forced to work with such a meagre pool of potential targets. He had two requirements. First, he needed a vehicle with a degree of prestige. Not necessarily much, but at least some. He couldn\u0027t be seen in a rusted and listing pick-up truck, for instance. That would not be remotely appropriate or plausible for a Mahmeini operative, especially one tasked to impress the Duncans. Image was by no means everything, but it greased the skids. Perception was reality, at least half the time. Second, he needed a car that wasn\u0027t brand new. Late-model cars had too much security built in. Computers, microchips in the keys, matching microchips in the keyholes. Nothing was unbeatable, of course, but a quick-and-dirty street job had its practical limits. Newer cars were best tackled with tow trucks or flatbeds, and then patient hours hidden away with ethernet cables and laptop computers. Lone men in the dark needed something easier. So, a clean sedan from a mainstream manufacturer, not new, but not too old either. Easy to find in Vegas. Five minutes, tops. But not in rural Nebraska. Not in farm country. He had just walked all over town looking for Asghar, and 90 per cent of what he had seen had been utilitarian, either pick-up trucks or ancient four-wheel-drives, and 99 per cent of those had been worn out, all battered and corroded and failing. Apparently Nebraskans didn\u0027t have much money, and even if they did they seemed to favour an ostentatiously blue-collar lifestyle. He stood in the cold and reviewed his options. He mapped out the blocks he had quartered before, and he tried to identify the kind of density he needed, and he came up with nothing. He had seen a sign to a hospital, and hospital parking lots were often good, because doctors bought new cars and sold their lightly used cast-offs to nurses and medical students, but for all he knew the hospital was miles away, certainly too far to walk without a guarantee of success. So he started in the Marriott lot. And finished there. He walked all around the H-shaped hotel and saw three pickup trucks, two with fitted camper beds, and an old Chrysler sedan with Arizona plates and a dented fender and sun-rotted paint, and a blue Chevrolet Impala, and a red Ford Taurus, and a black Cadillac. The pick-ups and the old Chrysler were out of the question for obvious reasons. The Impala and the Taurus were out of the question because they were too new, and they were obviously rentals, because they had barcode stickers in the rear side windows, which meant that almost certainly they belonged to Safir\u0027s guys and Rossi\u0027s guys, and he couldn\u0027t call them down to the lot and have them find him sitting in one of their own cars. Which left the Cadillac. Right age, right style. Local plates, neat, discreet, well looked after, clean and polished. Black glass. Practically perfect. A no-brainer. He put his bag on the ground right next to it and dropped flat and shuffled on his back until his head was underneath the engine. He had a tiny LED Mag-lite on his key chain, and he fumbled it out and lit it up and went hunting. Cars of that generation had a module bolted to the frame designed to detect a frontal impact. A simple accelerometer, with a two-stage function. Worst case, it would trigger the airbags. Short of that, it would unlock the doors, so that first responders could drag dazed drivers to safety. A gift to car thieves everywhere, therefore not much publicized, and replaced almost immediately with more sophisticated systems. He found the module. It was a simple tin can, square and small, cheap and basic, all caked in dry dirt, with wires coming out of it. He took out his knife and used the butt end of the handle and banged hard on the module. Dirt flaked off, but nothing else happened. He thought the dirt was maybe insulating the force of the blow, so he popped the blade on his knife and scraped the front of the module clean. Then he closed the blade and tried again. Nothing happened. He tried a third time, hard enough to worry about the noise he was making, bang, and the message got through. The Cadillac\u0027s dim electronic brain thought it had just suffered a minor frontal impact, not serious enough for the airbags, but serious enough to consider the first responders. There were four ragged thumps from above, and the doors unlocked. Technology. A wonderful thing. Mahmeini\u0027s man scrambled out and stood up. A minute later his bag was on the back seat and he was in the driver\u0027s seat. It was set way back. There was enough leg room for a giant. More proof, as if he needed any. Like he had told Rossi\u0027s guy, American peasants were all huge. He found the button and buzzed the cushion forward, on and on, about a foot, and then he jacked the seat back upright and got to work. He used the tip of his blade to force the steering lock, and then he pulled off the column shroud and stripped the wires he needed with the knife and touched them together. The engine started and a chime told him he didn\u0027t have his seat belt on. He buckled up and backed out and turned around and waited in the narrow lane parallel to the long side of the H, the engine idling silently, the climate control already warming. Then he pulled out his phone and went through the Marriott switchboard, first to Safir\u0027s guys, then to Rossi\u0027s, in both cases following Mahmeini\u0027s script exactly, telling them that plans had changed, that the party was starting early, that he and Asghar were leaving for the north immediately, and that they had five minutes to get their asses in gear, no more, or they would be left behind. The SUV was a GMC Yukon, metallic gold in colour, equipped to a high standard with a couple of option packs. It had beige leather inside. It was a nice truck. Certainly the kid called John seemed proud of it, and Reacher could see why. He was looking forward to owning it for the next twelve hours, or however long his remaining business in Nebraska might take. He said, \u0027Got a cell phone, John?\u0027 The guy paused a fatal beat and said, \u0027No.\u0027 Reacher said, \u0027And you were doing so well. But now you\u0027re screwing up. Of course you\u0027ve got a cell phone. You\u0027re part of an organization. You were on sentry duty. And you\u0027re under thirty, which means you were probably born with a minutes plan.\u0027 The guy said, \u0027You\u0027re going to do to me what you did to the others.\u0027 \u0027What did I do?\u0027 \u0027You crippled them.\u0027 \u0027What were they going to do to me?\u0027 The guy didn\u0027t answer that. They were on the two-lane road, north of the motel, well out in featureless farm country, rolling steadily along, nothing to see beyond the headlight beams. Reacher was half turned in his seat, his left hand on his knee, his right wrist resting on his left forearm, the Glock held easy in his right hand. Reacher said, \u0027Give me your cell phone, John.\u0027 He saw movement in the guy\u0027s eyes, a flash of speculation, a narrowing of the lids. Fair warning. The guy jacked his butt off the seat and took one hand off the wheel and dug in his pants pocket. He came out with a phone, slim and black, like a candy bar. He went to hand it over, but he lost his grip on it for a moment and juggled it and dropped it in the passenger foot well. \u0027Shit,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m sorry.\u0027 Reacher smiled. \u0027Good try, John,\u0027 he said. \u0027Now I bend over to pick it up, right? And you cave the back of my skull in with your right fist. I wasn\u0027t born yesterday, you know.\u0027 The guy said nothing. Reacher said, \u0027So I guess we\u0027ll leave it right where it is. If it rings, we\u0027ll let it go to voice mail.\u0027 \u0027I had to try.\u0027 \u0027Is that an apology? You promised me.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re going to break my legs and dump me on the side of the road.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s a little pessimistic. Why would I break both of them?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s not a joke. Those four guys you hurt will never work again.\u0027 \u0027They\u0027ll never work for the Duncans again. But there are other things to do in life. Better things.\u0027 \u0027Like what?\u0027 \u0027You could shovel shit on a chicken farm. You could whore yourself out in Tijuana. With a donkey. Either thing would be better than working for the Duncans.\u0027 The guy said nothing. Just drove. Reacher asked, \u0027How much do the Duncans pay you?\u0027 \u0027More than I could get back in Kentucky.\u0027 \u0027In exchange for what, precisely?\u0027 \u0027Just being around, mostly.\u0027 Reacher asked, \u0027Who are those Italian guys in the overcoats?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027 \u0027What do they want?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027 \u0027Where are they now?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027 They were in the blue Impala, already ten miles north of the Marriott, Roberto Cassano at the wheel, Angelo Mancini sitting right beside him. Cassano was working hard to stay behind Safir\u0027s boys in their red Ford, and both drivers were working hard to keep Mahmeini\u0027s guys in sight. The big black Cadillac was really hustling. It was doing more than eighty miles an hour. It was way far outside of its comfort zone. It was bouncing and wallowing and floating. It was quite a sight. Angelo Mancini was staring ahead at it. He was obsessed with it. He asked, \u0027Is it a rental?\u0027 Cassano was much quieter. Occupied by driving, certainly, concentrating on the crazy high-speed dash up the road, definitely, but thinking, too. Thinking hard. He said, \u0027I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a rental.\u0027 \u0027So what is it? I mean, what? Those guys have their own cars standing by in every state? Just in case? How is that possible?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 Cassano said. \u0027I thought at first maybe it\u0027s a limo. You know, like a car service. But it isn\u0027t. I saw the little squirt driving it himself. Not a car service driver. Just a glimpse, but it was him. The one who mouthed off at you.\u0027 Cassano said, \u0027I didn\u0027t like him.\u0027 \u0027Me either. And even less now. They\u0027re way bigger than we are. Way bigger than we thought. I mean, they have their own cars on standby in every state? They fly in on the casino plane, and there\u0027s a car there for them, wherever? What\u0027s that about?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 Cassano said again. \u0027Is it a funeral car? Do the Iranians run funeral parlours now? That could work, right? Mahmeini could call the nearest parlour and say, send us one of your cars.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t think the Iranians took over the funeral business.\u0027 \u0027So what else? I mean, how many states are there? Fifty, right? That\u0027s at least fifty cars standing by.\u0027 \u0027Not even Mahmeini can be active in all fifty states.\u0027 \u0027Maybe not Alaska and Hawaii. But he\u0027s got cars in Nebraska, apparently. How far up the list is Nebraska likely to be?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 Cassano said again. \u0027OK,\u0027 Mancini said. \u0027You\u0027re right. It has to be a rental.\u0027 \u0027I told you it\u0027s not a rental,\u0027 Cassano said. \u0027It can\u0027t be. It\u0027s not a current model.\u0027 \u0027Times are tough. Maybe they rent older cars now.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s not even last year\u0027s model. Or the year before. That\u0027s practically an antique. That\u0027s an old-guy car. That\u0027s your neighbour\u0027s granddad\u0027s Cadillac.\u0027 \u0027Maybe they have rent-a-wreck here.\u0027 \u0027Why would Mahmeini need that?\u0027 \u0027So what is it?\u0027 \u0027It doesn\u0027t really matter what it is. You\u0027re not looking at the big picture. You\u0027re missing the point.\u0027 \u0027Which is what?\u0027 \u0027That car was already at the hotel. We parked right next to it, remember? Late afternoon, when we got back. Those guys were there before us. And you know what that means? It means they were on their way before Mahmeini was even asked to send them. Something really weird is going on here.\u0027 The metallic gold GMC Yukon turned left off the north-south two-lane and headed west towards Wyoming on another two-lane that was just as straight and featureless as the first. Reacher pictured planners and engineers a century before, hard at work, leaning over parchment maps and charts with long rulers and sharp pencils, drawing roads, dispatching crews, opening up the interior. He asked, \u0027How far now, John?\u0027 The kid said, \u0027We\u0027re real close,\u0027 which as always turned out to be a relative statement. Real close in some places meant fifty yards, or a hundred. In Nebraska it meant ten miles and fifteen minutes. Then Reacher saw a group of dim lights, off to the right, seemingly in the middle of nowhere. The truck slowed and turned, another precise ninety-degree right angle, and headed north on a blacktop strip engineered in a different way from the standard county product. A private approach road, leading towards what looked like a half-built or half-demolished industrial facility of some kind. There was a concrete rectangle the size of a football field, possibly an old parking lot but more likely the floor slab of a factory that had either never been completed or had been later dismantled. It was enclosed on all four sides by a head-high hurricane fence that was topped by a mean and token allocation of razor wire. Here and there the fence posts carried lights, like domestic backyard fixtures, containing what must have been regular sixty- or hundred-watt bulbs. The whole enormous space was empty, apart from two grey panel vans in a marked-off bay big enough to handle three. The approach road was scalloped out at one point to allow access in and out of the concrete rectangle through a pair of gates. Then it ran onward towards a long low one-storey building built of brick in an unmistakable style. Classic 1940s industrial architecture. The building was an office block, built to serve the factory it once stood next to. The factory would have been a defence plant, almost certainly. Give a government a choice of where to build in wartime, and it will seek the safe centre of a land mass, away from coastal shelling and marauding aircraft and potential invasion sites. Nebraska and other heartland states had been full of such places. The ones lucky enough to be engaged on fantasy Cold War systems were probably still in business. The ones built to produce basic war-fighting items like boots and bullets and bandages had perished before the ink was dry on the armistice papers. The kid called John said, \u0027This is it. We live in the office building.\u0027 The building had a flat roof with a brick parapet, and a long line of identical windows, small panes framed with white-painted steel. In the centre was an unimpressive double door with a lobby behind it and dim bulkhead lights either side of it. In front of the doors was a short concrete path that led from an empty rectangle made of cracked and weedy paving stones, the size of two tennis courts laid end to end. Managerial parking, presumably, back in the day. There were no lights on inside the building. It just stood there, dead to the world. Reacher asked, \u0027Where are the bedrooms?\u0027 John said, \u0027To the right.\u0027 \u0027And your buddies are in there now?\u0027 \u0027Yes. Five of them.\u0027 \u0027Plus you, that\u0027s six legs to break. Let\u0027s go do it.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-dying-for-jack-reacher-15/page-16.html","bookId":2348,"book":{"id":2348,"title":"Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher #15)","description":"Storyline: Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher #15) There’s deadly trouble in the corn county of Nebraska . . . and Jack Reacher walks right into it. First he falls foul of the Duncans, a local clan that has terrified an entire county into submission. But it’s the unsolved, decades-old case of a missing child that Reacher can’t let go. The Duncans want Reacher gone—and it’s not just past secrets they’re trying to hide. For as dangerous as the Duncans are, they’re just the bottom of a criminal food chain stretching halfway around the world. For Reacher, it would have made much more sense to put some distance between himself and the hard-core trouble that’s bearing down on him. For Reacher, that was also impossible.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/worth-dying-for-jack-reacher-15.jpg","author":"Lee Child","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/worth-dying-for-jack-reacher-15.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:37 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:49 AM"}}
