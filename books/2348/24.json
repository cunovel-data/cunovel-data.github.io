{"id":66461,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"FIFTY-TWO\\n\\n AWHITE SUV PARKED ON THE ROAD BEYOND THE FENCE, AND THE guy who had broken Reacher\u0027s nose climbed out of the driver\u0027s seat. Then the passenger door opened and the kid called John got out. The kid Reacher had left at the depot. Go to bed, Reacher had said. But the kid hadn\u0027t gone to bed. He had hung out until he heard that things were safe, and then he had come out to claim his share of the fun.\\n\\n Dumb, dumb, dumb.\\n\\n The hallway was almost too crowded to move. It was full of football players, four of them lying around like carcasses, like beached whales, limbs taped, heads flopping. Reacher picked his way around them and watched out a window. The two late arrivals were making their way past Dorothy Coe\u0027s pick-up, past John\u0027s own Yukon, hustling through the damp and the cold, heading for the door, full of high spirits.\\n\\n Reacher opened the door and stepped out to meet them head on. He drew his sawn-off across his body, a long high exaggerated movement like a pirate drawing an ancient flintlock pistol, and he held it right-handed, elbow bent and comfortable, and he aimed it at the guy who had hit him. But he looked at John.\\n\\n \u0027You let me down,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Both guys came to a dead stop and stared at him a little more urgently than he thought was warranted, until he remembered the duct tape on his face. Like war paint. He smiled and felt it pucker. He looked back at the guy who had hit him and said, \u0027It was nothing that couldn\u0027t be fixed. But I\u0027m not certain you\u0027ll be able to say the same.\u0027\\n\\n Neither guy spoke. Reacher kept his eyes on the guy who had hit him and said, \u0027Take out your car keys and toss them to me.\u0027\\n\\n The guy said, \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m bored with John\u0027s Yukon. I\u0027m going to use your truck the rest of the day.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You think?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m pretty sure.\u0027\\n\\n No response.\\n\\n Reacher said, \u0027It\u0027s make-your-mind-up time, boys. Either do what I tell you, or get shot.\u0027\\n\\n The guy dipped into his pocket and came out with a bunch of keys. He held them up briefly, to prove what they were, and then he tossed them underhand to Reacher, who made no attempt to catch them. They bounced off his coat and landed on the gravel. Reacher wanted his left hand free and his attention all in one place. He looked at the guy again and asked, \u0027So how does your nose feel right now?\u0027\\n\\n The guy said, \u0027It feels OK.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It looks like it has been busted before.\u0027\\n\\n The guy said, \u0027Two times.\u0027\\n\\n Reacher said, \u0027Well, they say three is a lucky number. They say the third time\u0027s the charm.\u0027\\n\\n Nobody spoke.\\n\\n Reacher said, \u0027John, lie face down on the ground.\u0027\\n\\n John didn\u0027t move.\\n\\n Reacher fired into the ground at John\u0027s feet. The gun boomed and kicked and the sound rolled away across the land, loud and dull, like a quarry explosion. John howled and danced. Not hit, but stung in the shins by fragments of gravel kicked up by the blast. Reacher waited for quiet and pumped the gun, a solid crunch-crunch, probably the most intimidating sound in the world. The husk of the spent cartridge ejected and flew through the air and landed near the car keys and skittered away.\\n\\n John got down on the ground. First he got on his knees, awkwardly, like he was in church, and then he spread his hands and lowered himself face down, reluctantly, like a bad-tempered coach had demanded a hundred push-ups. Reacher called over his shoulder, \u0027Doctor? Bring me the duct tape, would you?\u0027\\n\\n No response from inside the house.\\n\\n Reacher called, \u0027Don\u0027t worry, doctor. There won\u0027t be any comebacks. Never again. This is the last day. Tomorrow you\u0027ll be living like normal people. These guys will be unemployed, heading back where they came from, looking for new jobs.\u0027\\n\\n There was a long, tense pause. Then a minute later the doctor came out with the tape. He didn\u0027t look at the two guys. He kept his face averted and his eyes down. Old habits. He gave the roll to Reacher and ducked back inside. Reacher tossed the tape to the guy who had hit him and said, \u0027Make it so your buddy can\u0027t move his arms or legs. Or I will, by some other method, probably including spinal injury.\u0027\\n\\n The guy caught the roll of tape and got to work. He wrapped John\u0027s wrists with a tight three-layer figure of eight, and then he wrapped the waist of the eight in the other direction, around and around. Plastic handcuffs. Reacher had no idea of the tensile strength of duct tape in terms of engineering numbers, but he knew no human could pull it apart lengthways. The guy did the same to John\u0027s ankles, and Reacher said, \u0027Now hog-tie him. Join it all up.\u0027\\n\\n The guy folded John\u0027s feet up towards his butt and wrapped tape between the wrist restraints and the ankle restraints, four turns, each about a foot long. He squeezed it all tight and stood back. Reacher took out his wrench and held it up. There was a little blood and hair on it, from the previous two guys. He dropped it on the ground behind him. He took out his switchblade. He dropped it on the ground behind him. He took out his Glock pistol. He dropped it on the ground behind him. Then he turned and laid the sawn-off next to it. He shrugged out of his coat and let it fall. It covered all four weapons. He looked at the guy who had hit him and said, \u0027Fair fight. You against me. Second-string Nebraska football against the U.S. Army. Bare knuckles. No rules. If you can get past me, you\u0027re welcome to use anything you can find under my coat.\u0027\\n\\n The guy looked blank for a second, and then he smiled a little, as if the sun had come out, as if an unbelievable circumstance had unveiled itself right in front of him, as if a hole had opened up in a tight defence, as if suddenly he had a straight shot to the end zone. He came up on his toes, and angled his body, and bunched his right fist up under his chin, and got ready to lead with his left.\\n\\n Reacher smiled too, just a little. The guy was dancing around like the Marquess of Queensberry. He had no idea. No idea at all. Maybe the last fight he had seen was in a Rocky movie. He was six-seven and three hundred pounds, but he was nothing more than a prize ox, big and dumb and shiny, going up against a gutter rat.\\n\\n A 250-pound gutter rat.\\n\\n The guy stepped in and bobbed and weaved for a minute, up on his toes, jiggling around, ducking and diving, wasting time and energy. Reacher stood perfectly still and gazed at him, wide-eyed with peripheral vision, focusing nowhere and everywhere at once, hyper-alert, watching the guy\u0027s eyes and his hands and his feet. And soon enough the left jab came in. The obvious first move, for a right-handed man who thought he was in a boxing ring. Any guy\u0027s left jab followed the same basic trajectory as his straight left, but much less forcefully, because it was powered by the arm only, snapping out from the elbow, with no real contribution from the legs or the upper body or the shoulders. No real power. Reacher watched the big pink knuckles getting closer, and then he moved his own left hand, fast, a blur, whipping it in and up and out like a man flailing backhanded at a wasp, and he slapped at the inside of the guy\u0027s wrist, hard enough to alter the line of the incoming jab, hard enough to deflect it away from his face and send it buzzing harmlessly over his moving shoulder.\\n\\n His shoulder was moving because he was already driving hard off his back foot, jerking forward, twisting at the waist, building torque, hurling his right elbow into the gap created by turning the guy counterclockwise an inch, aiming to hit him with the elbow right on the outer edge of his left eye socket, hoping to crack his skull along the line of his temple. No rules. The blow landed with all 250 pounds of moving mass behind it, a solid, jarring impact Reacher felt all the way down to his toes. The guy staggered back. He stayed on his feet. Evidently his skull hadn\u0027t cracked, but he was feeling it. He was feeling it bad, and his mouth was opening ready to howl, so Reacher shut it again for him with a vicious uppercut under the chin, convulsive, far from elegant, but effective. The guy\u0027s head snapped back in a mist of blood and bounced forward again off his massive deltoids and Reacher tried for his other eye socket with his left elbow, a ferocious in-and-out snap from the waist, and then he put a forearm smash from the right into the guy\u0027s throat, a real home run swing, and then he kneed him in the groin, and danced behind him and kicked him hard in the back of the knees, a sweeping, scything action, so that the guy\u0027s legs folded up under him and he went down heavily on his back on the path.\\n\\n Six blows, three seconds.\\n\\n No rules.\\n\\n Second-string Nebraska football against the U.S. Army.\\n\\n But the guy was tough. Or afraid. Or both. Either way, he didn\u0027t quit. He started scrabbling around on his back, like a turtle, trying to get up again, making botched snow angels in the gravel, his head snapping left and right. Maybe the decent thing would have been to let him take an eight-count, but having your opponent on the floor is gutter rat heaven, the absolute object of the exercise, a precious gift never to be spurned, so Reacher stilled him by kicking him hard in the ear, and then he stamped down hard with his heel in the guy\u0027s face, like an appalled homeowner stomping a cockroach, and the crunch of the guy\u0027s shattering nose was clearly audible over all the generalized panting and grunting and groaning and moaning.\\n\\n Game over. Eight blows in six seconds, which was grievously slow and laborious by Reacher\u0027s standards, but then, the guy was huge, and he had an athlete\u0027s tone and stamina, and he was accustomed to a certain amount of physical punishment. He had been competitive, just barely. In the ballpark, almost. Not the worst Reacher had ever seen. Four years of college ball was probably equivalent to four days of Ranger training, and plenty of people Reacher had known hadn\u0027t even made day three.\\n\\n He taped the guy up where he lay, with plastic handcuffs linked to four turns around the guy\u0027s own neck and ankle restraints linked to four turns around John\u0027s neck. Then he stepped back into the hallway and did a better job on the two who had come in first. He slid them around on the shiny parquet and taped them together, back to back, like the two from the middle of the night. He stood up and caught his breath.\\n\\n Then a phone rang, muted and distant.\\n\\n The phone turned out to be Dorothy Coe\u0027s cell. Its ring was muted and distant because it was with her, behind a closed door, in her room. She came out with it in her hand, and looked between it and the four taped guys on the hallway floor, and then she smiled, as if at a hidden irony, as if normality was intruding on a thoroughly abnormal day. She said, \u0027That was Mr Vincent at the motel. He wants me to work this morning. He has guests.\u0027\\n\\n Reacher asked, \u0027Who are they?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He didn\u0027t say.\u0027\\n\\n Reacher thought for a moment, and said, \u0027OK.\u0027 He told the doctor to keep a medical eye on all six of the captured football players, and then he went back out to the gravel path and put his coat back on. He reloaded the pockets with his improvised arsenal, and he found the car keys where they lay on the stones, and then he headed down the driveway to the white SUV parked beyond the fence.\\n\\n Eldridge Tyler moved, just a little, but enough to keep himself comfortable. He was into his second hour of daylight. He was a patient man. His eye was still on the scope. The scope was still trained on the barn door, six inches left of the judas hole, six inches down. The rifle\u0027s forestock was still bedded securely on the bags of rice. The air was wet and thick, but the sun was bright and the view was good.\\n\\n But the big man in the brown coat hadn\u0027t come.\\n\\n Not yet.\\n\\n And perhaps he never would, if the Duncans had been successful during the night. But Tyler was still fully on the ball, because he was cautious by nature, and he always took his tasks seriously, and maybe the Duncans hadn\u0027t been successful during the night. In which case the big man would show up very soon. Why would he wait? Daylight was all he needed.\\n\\n Tyler took his finger off the trigger, and he flexed his hand, once, twice, and then he put his finger back.\\n\\n FIFTY-THREE\\n\\n THE WHITE SUV TURNED OUT TO BE A CHEVY TAHOE, WHICH seemed to Reacher\u0027s untutored eye the exact same thing as a GMC Yukon. The cabin was the same. All the controls were the same. All the dials were the same. It drove just the same, big and sloppy and inexact, all the way back to the two-lane, where Reacher turned right and headed south. There was mist, but the sun was well up in the east. The day was close to two hours old.\\n\\n He slowed and coasted and then parked on the shoulder, two hundred yards short of the motel. From the north he could see nothing of it except the rocket sign and the big round lounge. He got out of the truck and walked on the blacktop, slow and quiet. His angle changed with every step. First he saw the burned-out Ford. It was in the main lot, down on its rims, black and skeletal, with two shapes behind the glassless windows, both of them burned as smooth and small as seals. Then he saw the doctor\u0027s Subaru, outside room six, jagged and damaged, but still a living thing in comparison to the Ford.\\n\\n Then he saw the dark blue Chevrolet.\\n\\n It was parked beyond the Subaru, outside room seven, or eight, or both, at a careless angle, at the end of four short gouges in the gravel. Frustrated men, tired and angry, jamming to a stop, ready for rest.\\n\\n Reacher came in off the road and walked to the lounge door, as quietly as he could on the loose stones, past the Ford. It was still warm. The heat of the fire had scorched fantastic whorls into the metal. The lounge door was unlocked. Reacher stepped inside and saw Vincent behind the reception desk. He was in the act of hanging up the telephone. He stopped and stared at Reacher\u0027s duct-tape bandage. He asked, \u0027What the hell happened to you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just a scratch,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027Who was on the phone?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It was the morning call. The same as always. Like clockwork.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The phone tree?\u0027 Reacher asked.\\n\\n Vincent nodded.\\n\\n \u0027And?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nothing to report. Three Cornhusker vehicles were tooling around all night, kind of aimlessly. Now they\u0027ve gone somewhere else. All four Duncans are in Jacob\u0027s house.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You have guests here,\u0027 Reacher said.\\n\\n \u0027The Italians,\u0027 Vincent said. \u0027I put them in seven and eight.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did they ask about me?\u0027\\n\\n Vincent nodded. \u0027They asked if you were here. They asked if I had seen you. They\u0027re definitely looking for you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027When did they get here?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027About five this morning.\u0027\\n\\n Reacher nodded in turn. A wild goose chase all night long, no success, eventual fatigue, no desire to drive an hour south to the Marriott and an hour back again, hence the local option. They had probably planned to nap for a couple of hours, and then saddle up once more, but they were oversleeping. Human nature.\\n\\n \u0027They woke me up,\u0027 Vincent said. \u0027They were very bad-tempered. I don\u0027t think I\u0027m going to get paid.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Which one of them shot the guys in the Ford?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t tell them apart. One did the shooting, and the other one set fire to the car.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And you saw that with your own eyes?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Would you go to court and say so?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, because the Duncans are involved.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Would you if the Duncans weren\u0027t involved?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t have that much imagination.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You told me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Privately.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tell me again.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027One of them shot the guys and the other one burned their car.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027OK,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027That\u0027s good enough.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027For what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Call them,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027One minute from now. In their rooms. Talk in a whisper. Tell them I\u0027m in your lot, right outside your window, looking at the wreck.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t be involved in this.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027This is the last day,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027Tomorrow will be different.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Forgive me if I prefer to wait and see.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tomorrow there are going to be three kinds of people here,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027Some dead, some sheepish, and some with a little self-respect. You need to get yourself in that third group.\u0027\\n\\n Vincent said nothing.\\n\\n \u0027You know Eleanor Duncan?\u0027 Reacher asked.\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s OK,\u0027 Vincent said. \u0027She was never part of this.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027ll be taking over. She\u0027ll be hauling your stuff tomorrow.\u0027\\n\\n Vincent said nothing.\\n\\n \u0027Call the Italians one minute from now,\u0027 Reacher said. He stepped back out to the lot and walked on the silver baulks of timber, past room one, past room two, past three and four and five and six, and then he looped around behind room seven and room eight, and came out again near room nine. He stood in a narrow gap shaped like an hourglass, the circular bulk of room eight right there in front of him, close enough to touch, room seven one building along, the Chevy and the Subaru and the burned-out Ford trailing away from him, south to north, in a line. He took out the dead Iranian\u0027s Glock and checked the chamber.\\n\\n All set.\\n\\n He waited.\\n\\n He heard the room phones ring, first one, then the other, both of them faint behind walls and closed doors. He pictured men rolling over on beds, struggling awake, sitting up, blinking, checking the time, looking around the unfamiliar spaces, finding the phones on the nightstands, answering them, listening to Vincent\u0027s urgent whispered messages.\\n\\n He waited.\\n\\n He knew what was going to happen. Whoever opened up first would wait in the doorway, half in and half out, gun drawn, leaning, craning his neck, watching for his partner to emerge. Then there would be gestures, sign language, and a cautious joint approach.\\n\\n He waited.\\n\\n Room eight opened up first. Reacher saw a hand on the jamb, then a pistol pointing almost vertical, then a forearm, then an elbow, then the back of a head. The pistol was a Colt Double Eagle. The forearm and the elbow were covered with a wrinkled shirtsleeve. The head was covered in uncombed black hair.\\n\\n Reacher backed off a step and waited. He heard room seven\u0027s door open. He sensed more than heard the rustle of starched cotton, the silent debate, the pointing and the tapped chests assigning roles, the raised arms indicating directions, the spread fingers indicating timings. The obvious move would be for the guy from room eight to leapfrog ahead and then duck around behind room six and circle the lounge on the blind side and hit the lot from the north, while the guy from room seven waited a beat and then crept up directly from the south. A no-brainer.\\n\\n They went for it. Reacher heard the farther guy step out and wait, and the nearer guy step out and walk. Eight paces, Reacher thought, before the latter passed the former. He counted in his head, and on six he stepped out, and on seven he raised the Glock, and on eight he screamed FREEZE FREEZE FREEZE and both men froze, already surrendering, guns held low near their thighs, tired, just woken up, confused and disoriented. Reacher stayed with the full-on experience and screamed DROP YOUR WEAPONS PUT YOUR WEAPONS ON THE GROUND and both men complied instantly, the heavy stainless pieces hitting the gravel in unison. Reacher screamed STEP AWAY STEP AWAY STEP AWAY and both men stepped away, out into the lot, isolated, far from their rooms, far from their car.\\n\\n Reacher breathed in and looked at them from behind. They were both in pants and shirts and shoes. No jackets, no coats. Reacher said, \u0027Turn around.\u0027\\n\\n They turned around.\\n\\n The one on the left said, \u0027You.\u0027\\n\\n Reacher said, \u0027Finally we meet. How\u0027s your day going so far?\u0027\\n\\n No answer.\\n\\n Reacher said, \u0027Now turn out your pants pockets. All the way. Pull the linings right out.\u0027\\n\\n They obeyed. Quarters and dimes and bright new pennies rained down, and tissues fluttered, and cell phones hit the gravel. Plus a car key, with a bulbous black head and a plastic fob shaped liked a big number one. Reacher said, \u0027Now back away. Keep going until I tell you to stop.\u0027\\n\\n They walked backward, and Reacher walked forward with them, keeping pace, eight steps, ten, and then Reacher arrived at where their Colts had fallen and said, \u0027OK, stop.\u0027 He ducked down and picked up one of the guns. He ejected the magazine and it fell to the ground and he saw it was full. He picked up the other gun. Its magazine was one short.\\n\\n \u0027Who?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n The guy on the left said, \u0027The other one.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The other what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The Iranians. You got one, we got the other. We\u0027re on the same side here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t think so,\u0027 Reacher said. He moved on towards the small pile of pocket junk and picked up the car key. He pressed the button set in the head and he heard the Chevy\u0027s doors unlock. He said, \u0027Get in the back seat.\u0027\\n\\n The guy on the left asked, \u0027Do you know who we are?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027You\u0027re two jerks who just got beat.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We work for a guy named Rossi, in Las Vegas. He\u0027s connected. He\u0027s the kind of guy you can\u0027t mess with.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Forgive me if I don\u0027t immediately faint with terror.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s got money, too. Lots of money. Maybe we could work something out.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Like what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s a deal going down here. We could cut you in. Make you rich.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m already rich.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t look it. I\u0027m serious. Lots of money.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve got everything I need. That\u0027s the definition of affluence.\u0027\\n\\n The guy paused a beat, and then he started up again, like a salesman. He said, \u0027Tell me what I can do to make this right for you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You can get in the back seat of your car.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because my arms are sore and I don\u0027t want to drag you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, why do you want us in the car?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because we\u0027re going for a drive.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll tell you after you get in.\u0027\\n\\n The two men glanced at a spot in the air halfway between them, not daring to let their eyes meet, not daring to believe their luck. An opportunity. Them in the back, a solo driver in the front. Reacher tracked them with the Glock, all the way to the car. One got in on the near side, and the other looped around the trunk. Reacher saw him glance onward, at the road, at the open fields beyond, and then Reacher saw him give up on the impulse to run. Flat land. Nowhere to hide. A modern nine-millimetre sidearm, accurate out to fifty feet or more. The guy opened his door and ducked his head and folded himself inside. The Impala was not a small car, but it was no limousine in the rear. Both guys had their feet trapped under the front seats, and even though they were neither large nor tall, they were both cramped and close together.\\n\\n Reacher opened the driver\u0027s door. He put his knee on the seat and leaned inside. The guy who had spoken before asked, \u0027So where are we going?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not far,\u0027 Reacher said.\\n\\n \u0027Can\u0027t you tell us?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m going to park next to the Ford you burned.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What, just up there?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I said not far.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And then what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then I\u0027m going to set this car on fire.\u0027\\n\\n The two men glanced at each other, not understanding. The one who had spoken before said, \u0027You\u0027re going to drive with us in the back? Like, loose?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You can put your seat belts on if you like. But it\u0027s hardly worth it. It\u0027s not very far. And I\u0027m a careful driver. I won\u0027t have an accident.\u0027\\n\\n The guy said, \u0027But,\u0027 and then nothing more.\\n\\n \u0027I know,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027I\u0027ll have my back turned. You could jump me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But you won\u0027t.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why not?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You just won\u0027t. I know it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why wouldn\u0027t we?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because you\u0027ll be dead,\u0027 Reacher said, and he shot the first guy in the forehead, and then the second, a brisk double tap, no pause, bang bang, no separation at all. The rear window shattered and blood and bone and brain hit the remains of the glass, delayed, slower than the bullets, and the two guys settled peacefully, slower still, like afterthoughts, like old people falling asleep, but with open eyes and fat beads of purple welling out of the neat holes in their brows, welling and lengthening and becoming slow lazy trickles that ran down to the bridges of their noses.\\n\\n Reacher backed out of the car and straightened up and looked north. Nine-millimetre Parabellums. Fine ammunition. The two slugs were probably hitting the ground right about then, a mile farther on, burning their way into the frigid dirt.\\n\\n Reacher checked room seven and found a wallet in a coat. There was a Nevada driver\u0027s licence in it, made out in the name of Roberto Cassano, at a local Las Vegas address. There were four credit cards and a little more than ninety dollars in cash. Reacher took sixty and got in the Impala and drove forty yards and parked tight up against the shell of the Ford. He gave the sixty bucks to Vincent in the lounge, two rooms, one night, and then he borrowed rags and matches, and as soon as the fuse was set in the Chevy\u0027s filler neck he hustled back to the Tahoe he had left on the shoulder. The first major flames were showing as he drove by, and he saw the fuel tank go up in his mirror, about four hundred yards later. The angle he was at and the way the fireball rose and then smoked and died made the motel sign look real, like it was a genuine working rocket, like it was blasting off for the infinite emptiness of space.\\n\\n Eldridge Tyler heard the gunshots. Two faint pops, rapid, a double tap, very distant, really nothing more than vague percussive holes in the winter air. Not a rifle. Not a shotgun. Tyler knew firearms, and he knew the way their sounds travelled across the land. A handgun, he thought, three or four miles away. Maybe the hunt was over. Maybe the big man was down. He moved again, easing one leg, easing the other, stretching one arm, stretching the other, rolling his shoulders, rotating his neck. He dug into his canvas tote bag and came out with a bottle of water and a brown-bread sandwich. He put both items within easy reach. Then he peered out through the space left by the missing louvre, and took a careful look around. Because maybe the big man wasn\u0027t down. Tyler took nothing for granted. He was a cautious man. His job was to watch and wait, and watch and wait he would, until he was told different.\\n\\n He leaned up on his hands and craned around and looked behind him. The sun had moved a little south of east and low slanting light was falling on the shelter\u0027s entrance. The tripwire\u0027s plastic insulation had dewed over with dawn mist and was glistening faintly. Ten minutes, Tyler thought, before it dried and went invisible again.\\n\\n He turned back and lay flat and snuggled behind the scope again, and he put his finger on the trigger. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-dying-for-jack-reacher-15/page-24.html","bookId":2348,"book":{"id":2348,"title":"Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher #15)","description":"Storyline: Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher #15) \\n There’s deadly trouble in the corn county of Nebraska . . . and Jack Reacher walks right into it. First he falls foul of the Duncans, a local clan that has terrified an entire county into submission. But it’s the unsolved, decades-old case of a missing child that Reacher can’t let go. \\n The Duncans want Reacher gone—and it’s not just past secrets they’re trying to hide. For as dangerous as the Duncans are, they’re just the bottom of a criminal food chain stretching halfway around the world. For Reacher, it would have made much more sense to put some distance between himself and the hard-core trouble that’s bearing down on him. For Reacher, that was also impossible.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/worth-dying-for-jack-reacher-15.jpg","author":"Lee Child","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/worth-dying-for-jack-reacher-15.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:37 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:49 AM"}}
