{"id":66463,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"FIFTY-SEVEN\n DOROTHY COE GOT BEHIND THE WHEEL OF HER TRUCK AGAIN AND the doctor and his wife slid in beside her. Reacher rode in the load bed, with the captured rifle, holding tight over the tractor ruts, a long slow mile, back to where he had left the white Tahoe he had taken from the football player who had broken his nose. It was still there, parked and untouched. Reacher got in and drove it and the other three followed behind. They went south on the two-lane and then coasted and stopped half a mile shy of the Duncan compound. The view from there was good. Reacher unscrewed the Leica scope from the rifle and used it like a miniature telescope. All three houses were clearly visible. There were five parked vehicles. Three old pick-up trucks, plus Seth Duncan\u0027s black Cadillac, and Eleanor Duncan\u0027s red Mazda. All of them were standing in a neat line on the dirt to the left of the southernmost house, which was Jacob\u0027s. All of them were cold and inert and dewed over, like they had been parked for a long time, which meant the Duncans were holed up and isolated, which was pretty much the way Reacher wanted it.\n He climbed out of the Tahoe and walked back to meet the others. He took the sawn-off from his pocket and handed it to Dorothy Coe. He said, \u0027You all head back and get car keys from the football players. Then bring me two more vehicles. Choose the ones with the most gas in the tank. Get back here as fast as you can.\u0027\n Dorothy Coe backed up a yard and turned across the width of the road and took off north. Reacher got back in the Tahoe and waited.\n Three isolated houses. Wintertime. Flat land all around. Nowhere to hide. A classic tactical problem. Standard infantry doctrine would be to sit back and call in an artillery strike, or a bombing run. The guerilla approach would be to split up and attack with rocket-propelled grenades from four sides simultaneously, with the main assault from the north, where there were fewest facing windows. But Reacher had no forces to divide, and no grenades or artillery or air support. He was on his own, with a middle-aged alcoholic man and two middle-aged women, one of whom was in shock. Together they were equipped with a bolt-action rifle with two rounds in it, and a Glock nine-millimetre pistol with sixteen rounds, and a sawn-off twelve-gauge shotgun with three rounds, and a switchblade, and an adjustable wrench, and two screwdrivers, and a book of matches. Not exactly overwhelming force.\n But time was on their side. They had all day. And the terrain was on their side. They had forty thousand unobstructed acres. And the Duncans\u0027 fence was on their side. The fence, built a quarter of a century before, as an alibi, still strong and sturdy. The law of unintended consequences. The fence was about to come right back and bite the Duncans in the ass.\n Reacher put the Leica to his eye again. Nothing was happening in the compound. It was still and quiet. Nothing was moving, except smoke coming from the chimneys on the first house and the last. The smoke was curling south. A breeze, not a wind, but the air was definitely in motion.\n Reacher waited.\n Fifteen minutes later Reacher checked the Tahoe\u0027s mirror and saw a little convoy heading straight for him. First in line was Dorothy Coe\u0027s truck, and then came the gold Yukon Reacher had taken from the kid called John. It had the doctor at the wheel. Last in line was the doctor\u0027s wife, driving the black pickup the first Cornhusker of the morning had arrived in. They all slowed and parked nose to tail behind the Tahoe. They all looked left, away from the Duncan compound, studiously averting their eyes. Old habits.\n Reacher climbed out of the Tahoe and the other three gathered around and he told them what they had to do. He told Dorothy Coe to keep the sawn-off, and he gave the Leica scope to the doctor\u0027s wife, and he took her scarf and her cell phone in exchange. As soon as they understood their roles, he waved them away. They climbed into Dorothy Coe\u0027s truck and headed south. Reacher was left alone on the shoulder of the two-lane, with the white Tahoe, and the gold Yukon, and the black pick-up, with the keys for all of them in his pocket. He counted to ten, and then he got to work.\n The black pick-up truck was the longest of the three vehicles, by about a foot, so Reacher decided to use it second. The white Tahoe had the most gas in it, so Reacher decided to use it first. Which left John\u0027s gold Yukon to use third, which Reacher was happy about, because he knew it drove OK.\n He walked back and forth along the line and started all three vehicles and left them running. Then he started leapfrogging them forward, moving them closer to the mouth of the Duncan driveway, a hundred yards at a time, getting them in the right order, hoping to delay detection for as long as possible. Without the scope, his view of the compound was much less detailed, but it still looked quiet. He got the black pick-up within fifty yards, and he left the gold Yukon waiting right behind it, and then he jogged back and got in the white Tahoe and drove it all the way forward. He turned it into the mouth of the driveway and lined it up straight and eased it to a stop.\n He slid out of the seat and crouched down and clamped the jaws of his adjustable wrench across the width of the gas pedal. He corrected the angle so that the stem of the wrench stuck up above the horizontal, and then he turned the knurled knob tight. He ducked back and hustled around the tailgate and opened the fuel filler door and took off the gas cap. He poked the end of the borrowed scarf down the filler neck with the longer screwdriver, and then he lit the free end of the scarf with his matches. Then he hustled back to the driver\u0027s door and leaned in and put the truck in gear. The engine\u0027s idle speed rolled it forward. He kept pace and put his finger on the button and powered the driver\u0027s seat forward. The cushion moved, slowly, an inch at a time, through its whole range, past the point where a person of average height would want it, on towards where a short person would want it, and then the front of the cushion touched the end of the wrench, and the engine note changed and the truck sped up a little. Reacher kept pace and kept his finger where it was and the seat kept on moving, and the truck kept on accelerating, and Reacher started running alongside, and then the seat arrived at the limit of its travel and Reacher stepped away and let the truck go on without him. It was rolling at maybe ten miles an hour, maybe less, not very fast at all, but enough to overcome the wash of gravel under its tyres. The ruts in the driveway were holding it reasonably straight. The scarf in the filler neck was burning pretty well.\n Reacher turned and jogged back to the road, to the black pickup, and he got in and drove it forward beyond the mouth of the driveway, and then he backed it up and in and parallel-parked it across the width of the space, between the fences, sawing it back and forth until he had it at a perfect ninety degrees, with just a couple of feet of open space at either end. The white Tahoe was rolling steadily, already halfway to its target, tramlining left and right in the ruts, trailing a bright plume of flame. Reacher pulled the black pick-up\u0027s keys and jogged back to the road. He leaned on the blind side of the gold Yukon\u0027s hood and watched.\n The white Tahoe was well ablaze. It rolled on through its final twenty yards, dumbly, unflinchingly, and it hit the front of the centre house and stopped dead. Two tons, some momentum, but no kind of a major crash. The wood on the house split and splintered, and the front wall bowed inward a little, and glass fell out of a ground floor window, and that was all.\n But that was enough.\n The flames at the rear of the truck swayed forward and came back and settled in to burn. They roiled the air around them and licked out horizontally under the sills and climbed up the doors. They spilled out of the rear wheel wells and fat coils of black smoke came off the tyres. The smoke boiled upward and caught the breeze and drifted away south and west.\n Reacher leaned into the Yukon and took the rifle off the seat.\n The flames crept onward towards the front of the Tahoe, slow but urgent, busy, seeking release, curling out and up. The rear tyres started to burn and the front tyres started to smoke. Then the fuel line must have ruptured because suddenly there was a wide fan of flame, a new colour, a fierce lateral spray that beat against the front of the house and rose up all around the Tahoe\u0027s hood, surging left and right, licking the house, lighting it, bubbling the paint in a fast black semicircle. Then finally flames started chasing the bubbling paint, small at first, then larger, like a map of an army swarming through broken defences, fanning out, seeking new ground. Air sucked in and out of the broken window and the flames started licking at its frame.\n Reacher dialled his borrowed cell.\n He said, \u0027The centre house is alight.\u0027\n Dorothy Coe answered, from her position half a mile west, out in the fields.\n She said, \u0027That\u0027s Jonas\u0027s house. We can see the smoke.\u0027\n \u0027Anyone moving?\u0027\n \u0027Not yet.\u0027 Then she said, \u0027Wait. Jonas is coming out his back door. Turning left. He\u0027s going to head around to the front.\u0027\n \u0027Positive ID?\u0027\n \u0027A hundred per cent. We\u0027re using the telescope.\u0027\n \u0027OK,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027Stay on the line.\u0027\n He laid the open cell phone on the Yukon\u0027s hood and picked up the rifle. It had a rear iron sight just ahead of the scope mount, and a front iron sight at the muzzle. Reacher raised it to his eye and leaned forward and rested his elbows on the sheet metal and aimed at the gap between the centre house and the southernmost house. Distance, maybe a hundred and forty yards.\n He waited.\n He saw a stocky figure enter the gap from the rear. A man, short and wide, maybe sixty years old or more. Round red face, thinning grey hair. Reacher\u0027s first live sighting of a Duncan elder. The guy hustled stiffly between the blank ends of the two homes and came out in the light and stopped dead. He stared at the burning Tahoe and started towards it and stopped again and then turned and faced front and stared at the pick-up truck parked across the far end of the driveway.\n Reacher laid the front sight on the guy\u0027s centre mass and pulled the trigger.\n FIFTY-EIGHT\n THE.338 HIT HIGH, A FOOT ABOVE JONAS DUNCAN\u0027S CENTRE mass, halfway between his lower lip and the point of his chin. The bullet drove through the roots of his front incisors, through the soft tissue of his mouth and his throat, through his third vertebra, through his spinal cord, through the fat on the back of his neck, and onward into the corner of Jacob Duncan\u0027s house. Jonas went down vertically, claimed by gravity, his stiff fireplug body suddenly loose and malleable, and he ended up sprawled in a grotesque tangle of limbs, face up, eyes open, the last of his brain\u0027s oxygenated blood leaking from his wound, and then he died.\n Reacher shot the rifle\u0027s bolt and the spent shell case clanged against the Yukon\u0027s hood and rolled down its contour and fell to the ground. Reacher picked up the cell phone and said, \u0027Jonas is down.\u0027\n Dorothy Coe said, \u0027We heard the shot.\u0027\n \u0027Any activity?\u0027\n \u0027Not yet.\u0027\n Reacher kept the phone against his ear. Jonas\u0027s house was burning nicely. The whole front wall was on fire, and there were flames inside, throwing orange light and shadows all around, curling flat and angry against the ceilings, gleaming wetly behind intact panes of glass, spilling out through the broken windows and leaping up and merging into the general conflagration. Smoke was still blowing south, and heat too, towards the southernmost building.\n Dorothy Coe\u0027s voice came back: \u0027Jasper is out. He has a weapon. A long gun. He sees us. He\u0027s looking right at us.\u0027\n Reacher asked, \u0027How far back are you?\u0027\n \u0027About six hundred yards.\u0027\n \u0027Stand your ground. If he fires, he\u0027ll miss.\u0027\n \u0027We think it\u0027s a shotgun.\u0027\n \u0027Even better. The round won\u0027t even reach you.\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s running. He\u0027s past Jonas\u0027s house. He\u0027s heading for Jacob\u0027s.\u0027\n Reacher saw him, flitting right to left across the narrow gap between Jonas\u0027s house and Jacob\u0027s, a short wide man very similar to his brother. On the phone Dorothy Coe said, \u0027He\u0027s gone inside. We see him in Jacob\u0027s kitchen. Through the window. Jacob and Seth are in there too.\u0027\n Reacher waited. The fire in Jonas\u0027s house was burning out of control. In front of it the white Tahoe was a blackened wreck inside a ball of flame. Glass was punching out of the house\u0027s windows ahead of flames that followed horizontally like arms and fists before boiling upward. The roof was alight. Then there was a loud sound and the air inside the house seemed to shudder and cough and a hot blue shimmer gasped out through the ground floor, like an expelled breath, clearly visible, like a force, and it rose slowly upward, one second, two, three, and then the flames came back even stronger behind it.\n Dorothy Coe said, \u0027Something just blew up in Jonas\u0027s kitchen. The propane tank, maybe. The back wall is burning hard.\u0027\n Reacher waited.\n Then the ground floor itself burned through and there was another cough and shudder as the flaming timbers tumbled through to the basement. The left-hand gable tilted inward and the right-hand gable fell outward, across the gap to Jasper\u0027s house. Sparks showered all around and thermals caught them and sent them shooting a hundred feet in the air. Jonas\u0027s right-hand wall collapsed into the gap and piled high against Jasper\u0027s left-hand wall, and gales of new air hit fresh unburned surfaces and vivid new flames leapt up.\n Reacher said, \u0027This is going very well.\u0027\n Then Jonas\u0027s second floor fell in with an explosion of sparks and his left-hand wall came unmoored and folded slowly and neatly in half, the top part falling inward into the fire and the bottom part angling outward and propping itself against Jacob\u0027s house. Burning timbers and bright red embers spilled and settled and sucked oxygen towards them and huge new flames started licking upward and outward and sideways. Even the weeds in the gravel were on fire.\n Reacher said, \u0027I think we\u0027re three for three. I think we got them all.\u0027\n Dorothy Coe said, \u0027Jasper is out again. He\u0027s heading for his truck.\u0027\n Reacher watched over the front sight of his rifle. He saw Jasper run for the line of cars. Saw him slide into a white pickup. Saw him start it up and back it out. It stopped and turned and aimed straight for the driveway. It blew through a shower of sparks, right past Jonas\u0027s body, and headed straight towards the two-lane. Straight towards Reacher. Straight towards the parked black truck. It braked hard and stopped short just behind it, and Jasper scrambled out. He opened the black truck\u0027s passenger door and ducked inside.\n Then a second later he ducked out again.\n No key.\n The key was in Reacher\u0027s pocket.\n Reacher put the phone on the Yukon\u0027s hood.\n Jasper Duncan stood still, momentarily unsure. Distance, maybe forty yards. Which was really no distance at all.\n Reacher shot him through the head and he went straight down the same way his brother had before him, leaving a small pink cloud in the air above him, made of pulverized blood and bone, which drifted an inch and then disappeared in the breeze.\n Reacher picked up the phone and said, \u0027Jasper is down.\u0027\n Then he dropped the empty gun on the road behind him and climbed inside the Yukon. Lack of replacement ammunition meant that phase one was over, and that phase two was about to begin.\n FIFTY-NINE\n REACHER DROVE THE YUKONA HUNDRED YARDS BEYOND THE mouth of the driveway, and then he turned right, on to the open dirt. Lumps and stones squirmed and pattered under his tyres. He drove a wide circle until he was level with the compound itself and then he stopped, facing the houses, the engine idling, his foot on the brake. From his new angle he saw that Jacob\u0027s south wall was so far untouched by the fire, but judging by the backdrop of smoke and flame the north end of the house was burning. Ahead and far to the left he could see Dorothy Coe\u0027s truck, waiting six hundred yards west in the fields, similarly nose-in and pent-up and expectant, like a gundog panting and crouching.\n He raised the phone to his ear and said, \u0027I\u0027m end-on now. What do you see?\u0027\n Dorothy Coe said, \u0027Jonas\u0027s house is about gone. All that\u0027s left is the chimney, really. The bricks are glowing red. And Jasper\u0027s house is on its way. His propane just blew up.\u0027\n \u0027How about Jacob\u0027s?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s burning north to south. Pretty fierce. Has to be getting hot in there.\u0027\n \u0027Stand by, then. It won\u0027t be long now.\u0027\n It was less than a minute. Dorothy Coe said, \u0027They\u0027re out,\u0027 and a second later Reacher saw Jacob and Seth Duncan spill around the back corner of the house. They ran ducked down and bent over, zigzagging, afraid of the rifle they thought was still out there. They made it to one of the remaining pick-up trucks and Reacher saw them open the doors from a crouch and then climb in and hunker down low. Behind them the north end of Jacob\u0027s house swelled and bellied and came down, quite slowly and gracefully, with sparks shooting up and out like fireworks, with burning timbers tumbling and spreading like lava from a volcano, reaching almost to the boundary fence, a vertical mass made horizontal, and then the south end of the house fell slowly backward and collapsed into the fire, leaving only the chimney upright.\n Reacher asked, \u0027How does it look?\u0027\n Dorothy Coe answered, \u0027Just like you said it would.\u0027\n Reacher saw Jacob Duncan at the wheel of the pick-up, shorter and broader than Seth in the passenger seat. Seth still had his splint taped to his face. The truck backed up ten yards, almost into the fire behind it, and then it drove forward and hit the fence, butting against it, trying to break through. The pick-up\u0027s front bumper bent out of shape and the hood crumpled a little, and the fence shuddered and rattled, but it held. Deep holes for the posts, sturdy timbers, strong rails. A big production. The law of unintended consequences.\n Jacob Duncan tried again. He backed up, much less than ten yards this time because the fire was spreading behind him, and then he shot forward once more. The truck hit the fence and he and Seth bounced around in the cab like rag dolls, but the fence held. Reacher saw Jacob glance backward again. There was no space for a longer run-up. The fire and the mean allocation of land did not permit it.\n Jacob changed his tactics. He manoeuvred until the nose of the truck was exactly halfway between two posts, and then he came in slow, in a low gear, pushing the grille into the rails, firming up the contact, then easing down on the gas, pushing harder and harder, hoping that sustained pressure would achieve what a sharp blow had not.\n It didn\u0027t. The rails bent, and they bowed, and they trembled, but they held. Then the pick-up\u0027s rear tyres lost traction and spun and howled in the dirt and the fence pushed back and the truck eased off six inches.\n The doors opened up again and Jacob and Seth spilled out and hustled over and tried the Cadillac instead. A heavier car, better torque, better power. But worse tyres, built for quiet and comfort out on the open road, not for traction over loose surfaces. Seth drove, hardly backing up at all for fear of putting his gas tank right in the flames behind him. Then he rolled four feet forward and the chrome grille hit the rails and the tyres spun almost immediately.\n Game over.\n \u0027Here they come,\u0027 Reacher said.\n Behind them the last vestigial support under the blazing structure gave way and the burning pile settled slowly and gently into a lower and wider shape, blowing gales of sparks and gases outward. Big curled flames danced free, burning the air itself, twisting and splitting and then vanishing. Heat distorted the air and gouts of fire hurled themselves a hundred feet up. Jacob and Seth shrank back and shielded their faces with their arms and ducked away.\n They climbed the fence.\n They dropped into the field.\n They ran.\n SIXTY\n JACOB AND SETH DUNCAN RAN THIRTY YARDS, A STRAIGHT LINE AWAY from the fire, pure animal instinct, and then they stopped and glanced back and spun in place, alone and insignificant in the empty acres. They saw the parked Yukon as if for the first time, and they stared at it in confusion, because it was one of theirs, driven by one of their own damn boys, and the guy wasn\u0027t coming to help them. Then they saw Dorothy Coe\u0027s truck far off in another direction and they glanced back at the Yukon and they understood. They looked at each other one last time, and they ran again, in different directions, Jacob one way, and Seth another.\n Reacher raised his phone.\n He said, \u0027If I\u0027m nine o\u0027clock on a dial and you\u0027re twelve, then Jacob is heading for ten and Seth is heading for seven. Seth is mine. Jacob is yours.\u0027\n Dorothy Coe said, \u0027Understood.\u0027\n Reacher took his foot off the brake and steered one-handed, following a lazy clockwise curve, heading first north and then east, bumping across the washboard surface, feeling the heat of the fires on the glass next to his face. Ahead of him Seth was stumbling through the dirt, heading for the road, still seventy yards short of getting there. Reacher saw something in his right hand, and then he heard Dorothy Coe\u0027s voice on the phone: \u0027Jacob has a gun.\u0027\n Reacher asked, \u0027What kind?\u0027\n \u0027A handgun. A revolver, I think. We can\u0027t see. We\u0027re bouncing around too much.\u0027\n \u0027Slow down and take a good look.\u0027\n Ten long seconds later: \u0027We think it\u0027s a regular six-shooter.\u0027\n \u0027Has he fired it yet?\u0027\n \u0027No.\u0027\n \u0027OK, back off, but keep him in sight. He\u0027s got nowhere to go. Let him get tired.\u0027\n \u0027Understood.\u0027\n Reacher laid the phone on the seat next to him and followed Seth south, staying thirty yards back. The guy was really hustling. His arms were pumping. Reacher had no scope, but he was prepared to bet the thing in Seth\u0027s right hand was a revolver too, probably half of a matched pair his father had shared.\n Reacher steered and accelerated and pushed on to within twenty yards. Seth was racing hard, knees pumping, arms pumping, his head thrown back. The thing in his hand was definitely a gun. The barrel was short, no longer than a finger. The two-lane road was forty yards away. Reacher had no idea why Seth wanted to get there. No point in it. The road was just a blacktop ribbon with no traffic on it and nothing but more dirt beyond. Maybe it was a generational thing. Maybe the youngest Duncan thought municipal infrastructure was going to save him. Or maybe he was heading home. Maybe he had more weapons in the house. He was going in roughly the right direction. In which case he was either terminally desperate or the world\u0027s biggest optimist. He had more than two miles to go, and he was being chased by a motor vehicle.\n Reacher stayed twenty yards back and watched. Way behind his left shoulder a last propane tank cooked off with a dull thump. The Yukon\u0027s mirror filled with sparks. Up ahead, Seth kept on running.\n Then he stopped running and whirled around and planted his feet and aimed his revolver two-handed, eye-high, with his aluminium mask right behind it. His chest was heaving and all four of his limbs were trembling and despite the two-handed grip the muzzle was jerking through a circle roughly the size of a basketball. Reacher slowed and changed gear and backed up and stood thirty yards off. He felt safe enough. He had a big V-8 engine block between himself and the gun, and anyway the chances of a panting untrained man even hitting the truck itself with a short-barrelled handgun at ninety feet were slight. The chances of a successful head shot through a windshield were less than zero. The chances of putting the round in the right zip code were debatable.\n Seth fired, three times, well spaced, with a jerky trigger action and plenty of muzzle climb and no lateral control at all. Reacher didn\u0027t even blink. He just watched the three muzzle flashes with professional interest and tried to identify the gun, but he couldn\u0027t at thirty yards. Too far away. He knew there were seven- and eight-shot revolvers in the world, but they weren\u0027t common, so he assumed it was a six-shooter and that therefore there were now three rounds left in it. Beside him the phone squawked with concern and he picked it up and Dorothy Coe asked, \u0027Are you OK? We heard shots fired.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m good,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027Are you OK? He\u0027s as likely to hit you as me. Wherever you are.\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027re good.\u0027\n \u0027Where\u0027s Jacob?\u0027\n \u0027Still heading south and west. He\u0027s slowing down.\u0027\n \u0027Stay on him,\u0027 Reacher said. He put the phone back on the seat. He kept his Glock in his pocket. The problem with being a right-handed man in a left-hand-drive truck was that he would have to bust out the windshield to fire, which used to be easy enough back in the days of pebbly safety glass, but modern automotive windshields were tough, because they were laminated with strong plastic layers, and anyway his heavy wrench was in the burned-out Tahoe, probably all melted back to ore.\n Seth rested, bending forward from the waist, his head coming down almost to his shins, and he forced air into his lungs, and he panted once, then twice, and he straightened up and held his breath and aimed the gun again, this time with much more concentration and much better control. Now the muzzle was moving through a circle the size of a baseball. Reacher turned the wheel and stamped on the gas and took off to his right, in a fast tight circle, and then he feinted to come back on his original line but wrenched the wheel the other way and rocked the truck through a figure eight. Seth fired once into empty space and then aimed again and fired again. A round smacked into the top of the Yukon\u0027s windshield surround, on the passenger side, six feet from Reacher\u0027s head.\n One round left, Reacher thought.\n But there were no rounds left. Reacher saw Seth thrashing at the trigger and he saw the gun\u0027s wheel turning and turning to no effect at all. Either the gun was a six-shooter that hadn\u0027t been fully loaded, or it was a five-shooter. Maybe a Smith 60, Reacher thought. Eventually Seth gave up on it and looked around desperately and then just hurled the empty gun at the Yukon. Finally, a decent aim. The guy would have been better off throwing rocks. The gun hit the windshield dead in front of Reacher\u0027s face. Reacher flinched and ducked involuntarily. The gun bounced off the glass and fell away. Then Seth turned and ran again, and the rest of it was easy.\n Reacher stamped on the gas and accelerated and lined up carefully and hit Seth from behind doing close to forty miles an hour. A car might have scooped him up and tossed him in the air and sent him cartwheeling backward over the hood and the roof, but the Yukon wasn\u0027t a car. It was a big truck with a high blunt nose. It was about as subtle as a sledgehammer. It caught Seth flat on his back, everywhere from his knees to his shoulders, like a two-ton bludgeon, and Reacher felt the impact and Seth\u0027s head whipped away out of view, instantaneously, like it had been sucked down by amazing gravity, and the truck bucked once, like there was something passing under the rear left wheel, and then the going got as smooth as the dirt would let it.\n Reacher slowed and steered a wide circle and came back to check if any further attention was required. But it wasn\u0027t. No question about it. Reacher had seen plenty of dead people, and Seth Duncan was more dead than most of them.\n Reacher took the phone off the passenger seat and said, \u0027Seth is down,\u0027 and then he lined up again and drove away fast, south and west across the field.\n SIXTY-ONE\n JACOB DUNCAN HAD GOTTEN ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YARDS FROM HIS house. That was all. Reacher saw him up ahead, all alone in the vastness, with nothing but open space all around. He saw Dorothy Coe\u0027s truck a hundred yards farther on, well beyond the running man to the north and the west. It was holding a wide slow curve, like a vigilant sheepdog, like a destroyer guaranteeing a shipping lane.\n On the phone Dorothy said, \u0027I\u0027m worried about the gun.\u0027\n Reacher said, \u0027Seth was a lousy shot.\u0027\n \u0027Doesn\u0027t mean Jacob is.\u0027\n \u0027OK,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027Pull over and wait for me. We\u0027ll do this together.\u0027\n He clicked off the call and changed course and crossed Jacob\u0027s path a hundred yards back and headed straight for Dorothy Coe. When he arrived she got out of her truck and headed for his passenger door. He dropped the window with the switch on his side and said, \u0027No, you drive. I\u0027ll ride shotgun.\u0027\n He got out and stepped around and they met where the front of the Yukon\u0027s hood was dented. No words were exchanged. Dorothy\u0027s face was set with determination. She was halfway between calm and nervous. She got in the driver\u0027s seat and motored it forward and checked the mirror, like it was a normal morning and she was heading out to the store for milk. Reacher climbed in beside her and freed the Glock from his pocket.\n She said, \u0027Tell me about the photographs. In their silver frames.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t want to,\u0027 Reacher said.\n \u0027No, I mean, I need to know there\u0027s no doubt they implicate the Duncans. Jacob in particular. Like evidence. I need you to tell me. Before we do this.\u0027\n \u0027There\u0027s no doubt,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027No doubt at all.\u0027\n Dorothy Coe nodded and said nothing. She fiddled the selector into gear and the truck took off, rolling slow, jiggling and pattering across the ground. She said, \u0027We were talking about what comes next.\u0027\n Reacher said, \u0027Call a trucker from the next county. Or do business with Eleanor.\u0027\n \u0027No, about the barn. The doctor thinks we should burn it down. But I\u0027m not sure I want to do that.\u0027\n \u0027Your call, I think.\u0027\n \u0027What would you do?\u0027\n \u0027Not my decision.\u0027\n \u0027Tell me.\u0027\n Reacher said, \u0027I would nail the judas hole shut, and I would leave it alone and never go there again. I would let the flowers grow right over it.\u0027\n There was no more conversation. They got within fifty yards of Jacob Duncan and switched to operational shorthand. Jacob was still running, but not fast. He was just about spent. He was stumbling and staggering, a short wide man limited by bad lungs and stiff legs and the aches and pains that come with age. He had a revolver in his hand, the same dull stainless and the same stubby barrel as Seth\u0027s. Probably another Smith 60, and likely to be just as ineffective if used by a weak man all wheezing and gasping and trembling from exertion.\n Dorothy Coe asked, \u0027How do I do this?\u0027\n Reacher said, \u0027Pass him on the left. Let\u0027s see if he stands and fights.\u0027\n He didn\u0027t. Reacher buzzed his window down and hung the Glock out in the breeze and Dorothy swooped fast and close to Jacob\u0027s left and he didn\u0027t turn and fire. He just flinched away and stumbled onward, a degree or two right of where he had been heading before.\n Reacher said, \u0027Now come around in a big wide circle and aim right for him from behind.\u0027\n \u0027OK,\u0027 Dorothy said. \u0027For Margaret.\u0027\n She continued the long leftward curve, winding it tighter and tighter until she came back to her original line. She coasted for a second and straightened up and then she hit the gas and the truck leapt forward, ten yards, twenty, thirty, and Jacob Duncan glanced back in horror and darted left, and Dorothy Coe flinched right, involuntarily, a civilian with forty years of safe driving behind her, and she hit Jacob a heavy glancing blow with the left headlight, hard in his back and his right shoulder, sending the gun flying, sending him tumbling, spinning him around, hurling him to the ground.\n \u0027Get back quick,\u0027 Reacher said.\n But Jacob Duncan wasn\u0027t getting up. He was on his back, one leg pounding away like a dog dreaming, one arm scrabbling uselessly in the dirt, his head jerking, his eyes open and staring, up and down, left and right. His gun was ten feet away.\n Dorothy Coe drove back and stopped and stood off ten yards away. She asked, \u0027What now?\u0027\n Reacher said, \u0027I would leave him there. I think you broke his back. He\u0027ll die slowly.\u0027\n \u0027How long?\u0027\n \u0027An hour, maybe two.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027\n Reacher gave her the Glock. \u0027Or go shoot him in the head. It would be a mercy, not that he deserves it.\u0027\n \u0027Will you do it?\u0027\n \u0027Gladly. But you should. You\u0027ve wanted to for twenty-five years.\u0027\n She nodded slowly. She stared down at the Glock, laid flat like an open book on both her hands, like she had never seen such a thing before. She asked, \u0027Is there a safety catch?\u0027\n Reacher shook his head.\n \u0027No safety on a Glock,\u0027 he said.\n She opened the door. She climbed down, to the sill step, to the ground. She looked back at Reacher.\n \u0027For Margaret,\u0027 she said again.\n \u0027And the others,\u0027 Reacher said.\n \u0027And for Artie,\u0027 she said. \u0027My husband.\u0027\n She stepped sideways around her open door, touching it with one hand as she went, slowly, with reluctance, and then she crossed the open ground, small neat strides on the dirt, ten of them, twelve, turning a short distance into a long journey. Jacob Duncan went still and watched her approach. She stepped up close and pointed the gun straight down and to one side, holding it a little away from herself, making it not part of herself, separating herself from it, and then she said some words Reacher didn\u0027t hear, and then she pulled the trigger, once, twice, three four five six times, and then she stepped away. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-dying-for-jack-reacher-15/page-26.html","bookId":2348,"book":{"id":2348,"title":"Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher #15)","description":"Storyline: \n Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher #15) \n There’s deadly trouble in the corn county of Nebraska . . . and Jack Reacher walks right into it.

For as dangerous as the Duncans are, they’re just the bottom of a criminal food chain stretching halfway around the world.
