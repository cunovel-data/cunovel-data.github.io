{"id":66440,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"SEVEN\n REACHER DRESSED AGAIN AFTER HIS SHOWER, COAT AND ALL because the room was cold, and then he turned the lights off and sat in the tub armchair and waited. He didn\u0027t expect Seth Duncan to call the cops. Apparently the cops were a county department, sixty miles away. No local ties. No local loyalties. And calling the cops would require a story, and a story would unravel straight to a confession about beating his wife. No smug guy would head down that route.\n But a smug guy who had just lost a bodyguard might have access to a replacement, or two or three. And whereas body-guarding was generally a reactive profession, those two or three substitutes might be persuaded to go proactive for one night only, especially if they were Brett\u0027s friends. And Reacher knew it wouldn\u0027t be hard to track him down. The Apollo Inn was probably the only public accommodation in two hundred square miles. And if the doctor\u0027s drinking habits were well known in the neighbourhood, it wouldn\u0027t be difficult to puzzle out the chain of causation. The phone call, the treatment, the intervention.\n So Reacher dressed again and laced his boots and sat in the dark and kept his ears open for tyres on gravel.\n More than four hundred and fifty miles due north of where Reacher was sitting, the United States finished and Canada began. The world\u0027s longest land border followed the 49th Parallel, over mountains and roads and rivers and streams, and through towns and fields and woods, its western portion running perfectly straight for nearly nineteen hundred miles, all the way from Washington State to Minnesota, every inch of it undefended in the military sense, most of it unfenced and unmarked, but much of it surveilled more closely than people knew. Between Washington State and Minnesota there were fifty-four official crossings, seventeen manned around the clock, thirty-six manned through daylight hours only, and one entirely unstaffed but equipped with telephones connected to remote customs offices. Elsewhere the line was randomly patrolled by a classified number of agents, and more isolated spots had cameras, and great lengths of it had motion sensors buried in the earth. The governments on both sides of the line had a pretty good idea of what was happening along its length.\n A pretty good idea, but not perfect knowledge. In the state of Montana, east of the Rockies, below the tree line, the land spent a hundred miles flattening from jagged peaks to gentle plains, most of it thickly forested with conifers, the woods interrupted only by sparkling streams and freshwater lakes and occasional sandy needle-strewn paths. One of those paths connected through labyrinthine miles of twists and turns to a dirt fire road, which ran south and in turn connected to a wandering gravel road, which many miles later ended as an inconspicuous left-hand turn off a minor county two-lane far to the north of a small no-account town called Hogg Parish.\n A grey panel truck made that left-hand turn. It rolled slowly along the gravel, crunching quietly, getting bounced left and right by the ruts and the bad camber, its springs creaking, its headlights off and its parking lights on. It burrowed ever deeper into the bitter cold and the darkness, endlessly. Then eventually it turned on to the fire road, beaten dirt now under its wheels, bare frozen trunks to the left and right, a narrow slice of night sky visible overhead, plenty of stars, no moon, the GPS satellites thousands of miles up connecting perfectly, guiding it, showing it the limits of safety.\n It crawled onward, many miles, and then the fire road petered out and the sandy track began. The truck slowed to a walk and locked into the ruts it had made on its many previous trips. It followed them left and right through arbitrary turns and curves, between scarred trees where the clearance was tight, with stubs of low branches scraping the sides. It drove for more than an hour and then came to a stop in a location chosen long before, exactly two miles south of the border. No one was certain where the motion sensors had been buried, but most assumed that a belt a mile either side of the line was the practical limit. Like a minefield. Another mile had been added as a safety margin, and a small area of underbrush had been hacked out to allow the truck to turn.\n The truck backed up and turned and stopped astride the sandy track, facing south, in position, ready. It shut down and settled and its lights went off.\n It waited.\n Reacher waited in the dark in his tub armchair, forty minutes, an hour, tracing the next day\u0027s intended route in his head. South to the Interstate, and then east. The Interstate would be easy. He had hitchhiked most of the network before. There were on-ramps and rest areas and a vast travelling population, some of it commercial, some of it private, a fair proportion of it lonely and ready for company. The problem would come before the Interstate, on the middle-of-nowhere trek down to it. Since climbing out of the car that had dumped him at the crossroads he had heard no traffic at all. Night-time was always worse than daytime, but even so it was rare in America to be close to a road and hear nothing go by. In fact he had heard nothing at all, no wind, no night sounds, and he had been listening hard, for tyres on gravel. It was like he had gone deaf. He raised his hand awkwardly and clicked his fingers near his ear, just to be sure. He wasn\u0027t deaf. It was just the middle of the night, in the countryside. That was all. He got up and used the bathroom and sat back down.\n Then he heard something.\n Not a passing vehicle, not wind, not night sounds.\n Not tyres on gravel.\n Footsteps on gravel.\n EIGHT\n FOOTSTEPS ON GRAVEL. ONE PAIR. A LIGHT, HESITANT TREAD, approaching. Reacher watched the window and saw a shape flit across it. Small, slight, head ducked down into the collar of a coat.\n A woman.\n There was a knock at the door, soft and tentative and padded. A small nervous hand, wearing a glove. A decoy, possibly. Not beyond the wit of man to send someone on ahead, all innocent and unthreatening, to get the door open and lull the target into a sense of false security. Not unlikely that such a person would be nervous and hesitant about her role.\n Reacher crossed the floor silently and headed back to the bathroom. He eased the window up and clipped out the screen and rested it in the bathtub. Then he ducked his head and climbed out, scissoring his legs over the sill, stepping down to the gravel. He walked one of the silver timbers that boxed the path, like a tightrope, silently. He went counterclockwise around the circular cabin and came up on the woman from behind.\n She was alone.\n No cars on the road, nobody in the lot, nobody flattened either side of his door, nobody crouched under his window. Just the woman, standing there on her own. She looked cold. She was wearing a wool coat and a scarf. No hat. She was maybe forty, small, dark, and worried. She raised her hand and knocked again.\n Reacher said, \u0027I\u0027m here.\u0027\n She gasped and spun around and put her hand on her chest. Her mouth stayed open and made a tiny O. He said, \u0027I\u0027m sorry if I startled you, but I wasn\u0027t expecting visitors.\u0027\n She said, \u0027Perhaps you should have been.\u0027\n \u0027Well, in fact, perhaps I was. But not you.\u0027\n \u0027Can we go inside?\u0027\n \u0027Who are you?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027m the doctor\u0027s wife.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m pleased to meet you,\u0027 Reacher said.\n \u0027Can we go inside?\u0027\n Reacher found the key in his pocket and unlocked the door from the outside. The doctor\u0027s wife stepped in and he followed her and locked the door again behind them. He crossed the room and closed the bathroom door against the night air coming in through the open window. He turned back to find her standing in the middle of the space. He indicated the armchair and said, \u0027Please.\u0027\n She sat down. Didn\u0027t unbutton her coat. She was still nervous. If she had been carrying a purse, she would have had it clamped hard on her knees, defensively. She said, \u0027I walked all the way over here.\u0027\n \u0027To pick up the car? You should have let your husband do that, in the morning. That\u0027s what I arranged with him.\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s too drunk to drive.\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027ll be OK by morning, surely.\u0027\n \u0027Morning\u0027s too late. You have to get going. Right now. You\u0027re not safe here.\u0027\n \u0027You think?\u0027\n \u0027My husband said you\u0027re heading south to the Interstate. I\u0027ll drive you there.\u0027\n \u0027Now? It\u0027s got to be a hundred miles.\u0027\n \u0027A hundred and twenty.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s the middle of the night.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re not safe here. My husband told me what happened. You interfered with the Duncans. You saw. They\u0027ll punish him for sure, and we think they\u0027ll come after you too.\u0027\n \u0027They?\u0027\n \u0027The Duncans. There are four of them.\u0027\n \u0027Punish him how?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, I don\u0027t know. Last time they wouldn\u0027t let him come here for a month.\u0027\n \u0027Here? To the lounge?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s his favourite place.\u0027\n \u0027How could they stop him coming here?\u0027\n \u0027They told Mr Vincent not to serve him. The owner.\u0027\n \u0027Why would the owner of this place do what the Duncans tell him?\u0027\n \u0027The Duncans run a trucking business. All of Mr Vincent\u0027s supplies come through them. He signed a contract. He kind of had to. That\u0027s how the Duncans work. So if Mr Vincent doesn\u0027t play ball, a couple of deliveries will be late, a couple lost, a couple damaged. He knows that. He\u0027ll go out of business.\u0027\n Reacher asked, \u0027What will they figure to do to me?\u0027\n The woman said, \u0027They hire football players right out of college. Cornhuskers. The ones who were good enough to get scholarships, but not good enough to go to the NFL. Guards and tackles. Big guys.\u0027\n Brett, Reacher thought.\n The woman said, \u0027They\u0027ll connect the dots and figure out where you are. I mean, where else could you be? They\u0027ll pay you a visit. Maybe they\u0027re already on their way.\u0027\n \u0027From where?\u0027\n \u0027The Duncan depot is twenty miles from here. Most of their people live close to it.\u0027\n \u0027How many football players have they got?\u0027\n \u0027Ten.\u0027\n Reacher said nothing.\n The woman said, \u0027My husband heard you say you\u0027re headed for Virginia.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s the plan.\u0027\n \u0027Is that where you live?\u0027\n \u0027As much as anywhere else.\u0027\n \u0027We should get going. You\u0027re in big trouble.\u0027\n \u0027Not unless they send all nine at once,\u0027 Reacher said.\n \u0027All nine what?\u0027\n \u0027Football players.\u0027\n \u0027I said there were ten.\u0027\n \u0027I already met one of them. He\u0027s currently indisposed. They\u0027re one short, as of tonight.\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027\n \u0027He got between me and Seth Duncan.\u0027\n \u0027What did you do to Seth Duncan?\u0027\n \u0027I broke his nose.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, sweet Jesus. Why?\u0027\n \u0027Why not?\u0027\n \u0027Oh sweet, sweet Jesus. Where are the car keys?\u0027\n \u0027What will happen to Mrs Duncan?\u0027\n \u0027We need to get going. Right this minute.\u0027\n \u0027First answer the question.\u0027\n \u0027Mrs Duncan will be punished too. For calling my husband. She\u0027s been told not to do that. Just like he\u0027s been told not to go treat her.\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s a doctor. He doesn\u0027t get a choice. They take an oath, don\u0027t they?\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s your name?\u0027\n \u0027Jack Reacher.\u0027\n \u0027We have to go, Mr Reacher. Right now.\u0027\n \u0027What will they do to Mrs Duncan?\u0027\n \u0027This isn\u0027t your business,\u0027 the woman said. Which, strictly speaking, was fairly close to Reacher\u0027s own opinion at that point. His business was to get himself to Virginia, and he was being offered a ride through the hardest part of the journey, fast and free. I-80 awaited, two hours away. An on-ramp, the last of the night drivers, the first stirrings of morning traffic. Maybe breakfast. Maybe there was a rest area or a truck stop with a greasy spoon cafe. Bacon, eggs, coffee.\n \u0027What will they do to her?\u0027 he asked again.\n The woman said, \u0027Probably nothing much.\u0027\n \u0027What kind of nothing much?\u0027\n \u0027Well, they might put her on a coagulant. One of the uncles seems to have medical supplies. Or maybe they\u0027ll just stop her taking so much aspirin. So she doesn\u0027t bleed so bad next time. And they\u0027ll probably ground her for a month. That\u0027s all. Nothing too serious. Nothing for you to worry about. They\u0027ve been married ten years, after all. She\u0027s not a prisoner. She could leave if she wanted to.\u0027\n \u0027Except this time she inadvertently got her husband\u0027s nose broken. He might take that out on her, if he can\u0027t take it out on me.\u0027\n The doctor\u0027s wife said nothing. But it sounded like she was agreeing. The strange round room went quiet. Then Reacher heard tyres on gravel.\n NINE\n REACHER CHECKED THE WINDOW. THERE WERE FOUR TYRES IN total, big knobbly off-road things, all of them on a Ford pick-up truck. The truck had a jacked suspension and lights on a roof bar and a snorkel air intake and a winch on the front. There were two large shapes in the gloom inside. The shapes had thick necks and huge shoulders. The truck nosed slowly down the row of cabins and stopped twenty feet behind the parked Subaru. The headlights stayed on. The engine idled. The doors opened. Two guys climbed out.\n They both looked like Brett, only bigger. Late twenties, easily six-six or six-seven, probably close to three hundred pounds each, big waists made tiny by huge chests and arms and shoulders. They had cropped hair and small eyes and fleshy faces. They were the kind of guys who ate two dinners and were still hungry afterwards. They were wearing red Cornhuskers football jackets made grey by the blue light from the cabin\u0027s eaves.\n The doctor\u0027s wife joined Reacher at the window.\n \u0027Sweet Jesus,\u0027 she said.\n Reacher said nothing.\n The two guys closed the truck\u0027s doors and stepped back in unison to the load bed and unlatched a tool locker bolted across its width behind the cab. They lifted the lid and one took out an engineer\u0027s ball-peen hammer and the other took out a two-headed wrench at least a foot and a half long. They left the lid open and walked forward into the truck\u0027s headlight wash and their shadows jumped ahead of them. They were light on their feet and nimble for their size, like football players usually were. They paused for a moment and looked at the cabin\u0027s door, and then they turned away.\n Towards the Subaru.\n They attacked it in a violent frenzy, an absolute blitzkrieg, two or three minutes of uncontrolled smashing and pounding. The noise was deafening. They smashed every shard of glass out of the windshield, they smashed the side windows, the back window, the headlights, the tail lights. They hammered jagged dents into the hood, into the doors, into the roof, into the fenders, into the tailgate. They put their arms through the absent glass and smashed up the dials and the switches and the radio.\n Shit, Reacher thought. There goes my ride.\n \u0027My husband\u0027s punishment,\u0027 the doctor\u0027s wife whispered. \u0027Worse this time.\u0027\n The two guys stopped as suddenly as they had started. They stood there, one each side of the wrecked wagon, and they breathed hard and rolled their shoulders and let their weapons hang down by their sides. Pebbles of broken automotive glass glittered in the neon and the boom and clang of battered sheet metal echoed away to absolute silence.\n Reacher took off his coat and dumped it on the bed.\n The two guys formed up shoulder to shoulder and headed for the cabin\u0027s door. Reacher opened it up and stepped out to meet them head on. Win or lose, fighting inside would bust up the room, and Vincent the motel owner had enough problems already.\n The two guys stopped ten feet away and stood there, side by side, symmetrical, their weapons in their outside hands, four cubic yards of bone and muscle, six hundred pounds of beef, all flushed and sweating in the chill.\n Reacher said, \u0027Pop quiz, guys. You spent four years in college learning how to play a game. I spent thirteen years in the army learning how to kill people. So how scared am I?\u0027\n No answer.\n \u0027And you were so bad at it you couldn\u0027t even get drafted afterwards. I was so good at it I got all kinds of medals and promotions. So how scared are you?\u0027\n \u0027Not very,\u0027 said the guy with the wrench.\n Wrong answer. But understandable. Being a good enough guard or tackle in high school to get a full-boat free ride to the big school in Lincoln was no mean achievement. Playing even a cameo role on the field in Memorial Stadium made a guy close to the best of the best. And failing to make the National Football League was no kind of real disgrace. The dividing line between success and failure in the world of sports was often very narrow, and the reasons for falling on one side or the other were often very arbitrary. These guys had been the elite for most of twenty years, the greatest thing their neighbourhood had ever seen, then their town, then their county, maybe their state. They had been popular, they had been feted, they had gotten the girls. And they probably hadn\u0027t lost a fight since they were eight years old.\n Except they had never had a fight. Not in the sense meant by people paid to fight or die. Pushing and shoving at the schoolyard gate or on the sidewalk outside the soda shop or late at night after a start-of-summer keg party was as far from fighting as two fat guys tossing lame spirals in the park were from the Superbowl. These guys were amateurs, and worse, they were complacent amateurs, accustomed to getting by on bulk and reputation alone. In the real world, they would be dead before they even landed a blow.\n Case in point: bad choice of weapons. Best are shooting weapons, second best are stabbing weapons, third best are slashing weapons. Blunt instruments are way down the list. They slow hand speed. Their uncontrolled momentum is disadvantageous after a miss. And: if you have to use them, the backhand is the only way to go, so that you accelerate and strike in the same sudden fluid motion. But these guys were shoulder to shoulder with their weapons in their outer hands, which promised forehand swings, which meant that the hammer or the wrench would have to be swung backward first, then stopped, then brought forward again. The first part of the move would be a clear telegraph. All the warning in the world. No surprise. They might as well put a notice in the newspaper, or send a cable by Western Union.\n Reacher smiled. He had been raised on military bases all around the world, battling hardcore Marine progeny, honing his skills against gangs of resentful native youths in dusty Pacific streets and damp European alleys. Whatever hardscrabble town in Texas or Arkansas or Nebraska these guys had come up in had been a feather bed by comparison. And while they had been studying the playbook and learning to run and jump and catch, he had been broken down and built back up by the kind of experts who could snap your neck so fast you never knew it had happened until you went to nod your head and it rolled away down the street without you.\n The guy with the wrench said, \u0027We\u0027ve got a message for you, pal.\u0027\n Reacher said, \u0027Really?\u0027\n \u0027Actually it\u0027s more of a question.\u0027\n \u0027Any difficult words? You need more time?\u0027 Reacher stepped forward and a little to his right. He put himself directly in front of the two guys, equidistant, seven feet away, so that if he was six on a clock face, they were eleven and one. The guy with the wrench was on his left, and the guy with the hammer was on his right.\n The guy with the wrench moved first. He dumped his weight on his right foot and started a short, compact backswing with the heavy metal tool, a backswing that looked designed to bounce off tensed muscles after perhaps forty degrees or a couple of feet, and then snap forward again through a low horizontal arc, aiming to break Reacher\u0027s left arm between the shoulder and the elbow. The guy wasn\u0027t a total idiot. It was a decent first try.\n But it was uncompleted.\n Reacher had his weight on his left foot, and he had his right foot moving a split second after the wrench, driving the same way at the same speed, maybe even a little faster, and before the wrench stopped moving backward and started moving forward the heel of Reacher\u0027s boot met the big guy\u0027s knee and drove right through it, smashing the kneecap deep into the joint, bursting it, rupturing ligaments, tearing tendons, dislocating the joint, turning it inside out, making it fold forward the way no knee is designed to go. The guy started to drop and before he was past the first vertical inch and before the first howl was starting in his throat Reacher was stepping past him, on the outside, shouldering him aside, deleting him from memory, forgetting all about him. He was now essentially an unarmed one-legged man, and one-legged men had never featured near the top of Reacher\u0027s concerns.\n The guy with the hammer had a split-second choice to make. He could spin on the forehand, but that would give him almost a full circle to move through, because Reacher was now almost behind him, and anyway his crippled buddy was in the way of the spin, just waiting helplessly for a face to face collision. Or the guy could flail on the backhand, a Hail Mary blind swing into the void behind him, hoping for surprise, hoping for a lucky contact.\n He chose to flail behind him.\n Which Reacher was half expecting and wholly rooting for. He watched the lunge, the arm moving, the wrist flicking back, the elbow turning inside out, and he planted his feet and jerked from the waist and drove the heel of his hand into the knob of the guy\u0027s elbow, that huge force jabbing one way, the weight of the swinging hammer pulling the other way, the elbow joint cracking, the wrist overextending, the hammer falling, the guy instantly crumpling and dancing and hopping and trying to force his body to a place where his elbow stayed bent the right way around, which pulled him through a tight counterclockwise circle and left him unsteady and unbalanced and face to face with Reacher, who paused less time than it took for the hammer to hit the floor and then head-butted him hard in the face, a savage, snapping movement, solid bone-to-bone contact, and then Reacher danced away towards the wrecked Subaru and turned and planned the next second and a half.\n The guy who had held the wrench was down, rolling around, in Reacher\u0027s judgement stunned not so much by the pain, most of which would be still to come, but by the awful dawning knowledge that life as he knew it was over, the momentary fears he might have experienced as an athlete after a bad on-field collision finally come true, his future now holding nothing but canes and braces and limps and pain and frustration and unemployment. The guy who had held the hammer was still on his feet, back on his heels, blinking, his nose pouring blood, one arm limp and numb, his eyes unfocused, not a whole lot going on in his head.\n Enough, a person might say, if that person lived in the civilized world, the world of movies and television and fair play and decent restraint. But Reacher didn\u0027t live there. He lived in a world where you don\u0027t start fights but you sure as hell finish them, and you don\u0027t lose them either, and he was the inheritor of generations of hard-won wisdom that said the best way to lose them was to assume they were over when they weren\u0027t yet. So he stepped back to the guy who had held the hammer and risked his hands and his arms and crashed a low right hook into the skinny triangle below the guy\u0027s pectorals and above his six-pack abdominals, a huge blow, timed and jerked and delivered to perfection, straight into the solar plexus, hitting it like a switch, and the guy went into all kinds of temporary distress and sagged forward and down. Reacher waited until he was bent low enough for the finishing kick to the face, delivered hard but with a degree of mercy, in that smashed teeth and a busted jaw were better than out-and-out brain damage.\n Then he turned to the guy who had held the wrench and waited until he rolled the right way and put him to sleep with a kick to the forehead. He picked up the wrench and broke the guy\u0027s wrist with it, one, and then the other wrist, two, and turned back and did the same to the guy who had held the hammer, three, four. The two men were somebody\u0027s weapons, consciously deployed, and no soldier left an enemy\u0027s abandoned ordnance on the field in working order.\n The doctor\u0027s wife was watching from the cabin door, all kinds of terror in her face.\n \u0027What?\u0027 Reacher asked her. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-dying-for-jack-reacher-15/page-3.html","bookId":2348,"book":{"id":2348,"title":"Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher #15)","description":"Storyline: \n Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher #15) \n There’s deadly trouble in the corn county of Nebraska . . . and Jack Reacher walks right into it.
