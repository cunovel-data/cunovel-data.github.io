{"id":66458,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"FORTY-SEVEN\n JACOB WAS FIRST UP THE CELLAR STAIRS. HIS FIRST THOUGHT WAS that a football player was checking in, but the floors in their houses were typical of old-style construction in rural America, built of boards cut from the hearts of old pines, thick and dense and heavy, capable of transmitting noise but not detail. So it was not possible to say who was in the house by sound alone. He saw no one in the hallway, but when he got to the kitchen he found a man in there, standing still, small and wiry, dark and dead-eyed, rumpled, not very clean, wearing a buttoned shirt without a tie, holding a knife in his left hand and a gun in his right. The knife was held low, but the gun was pointing straight at the centre of Jacob\u0027s chest.\n Jacob stood still.\n The man put his knife on the kitchen table and raised his forefinger to his lips.\n Jacob made no sound.\n Behind him his son and his brothers crowded into the kitchen, too soon to be stopped. The man moved the muzzle of his gun, left and right, back and forth. The four Duncans lined up, shoulder to shoulder. The man turned his wrist and moved the muzzle down and up, down and up, patting the air with it. No one moved.\n The man said, \u0027Get on your knees.\u0027\n Jacob asked, \u0027Who are you?\u0027\n The man said, \u0027You killed my friend.\u0027\n \u0027I didn\u0027t.\u0027\n \u0027One of you Duncans did.\u0027\n \u0027We didn\u0027t. We don\u0027t even know who you are.\u0027\n \u0027Get on your knees.\u0027\n \u0027Who are you?\u0027\n The little man picked up his knife again and asked, \u0027Which one of you is Seth?\u0027\n Seth Duncan paused a beat and then raised his good hand, like a kid in class.\n The little man said, \u0027You killed my friend and you put his body in the trunk of your Cadillac.\u0027\n Jacob said, \u0027No, Reacher stole that car this afternoon. It was him.\u0027\n \u0027Reacher doesn\u0027t exist.\u0027\n \u0027He does. He broke my son\u0027s nose. And his hand.\u0027\n The gun didn\u0027t move, but the little man turned his head and looked at Seth. The aluminium splint, the swollen fingers. Jacob said, \u0027We haven\u0027t left here all day. But Reacher was at the Marriott. This afternoon, and this evening. We know that. He left the Cadillac there.\u0027\n \u0027Where is he now?\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027re not sure. Close by, we think.\u0027\n \u0027How did he get back?\u0027\n \u0027Perhaps he took your rental car. Did your friend have the key?\u0027\n The little man didn\u0027t answer.\n Jacob asked, \u0027Who are you?\u0027\n \u0027I represent Mahmeini.\u0027\n \u0027We don\u0027t know who that is.\u0027\n \u0027He buys your merchandise from Safir.\u0027\n \u0027We don\u0027t know anyone of that name either. We sell to an Italian gentleman in Las Vegas, name of Mr Rossi, and after that we have no further interest.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re trying to cut everyone out.\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027re not. We\u0027re trying to get our shipment home, that\u0027s all.\u0027\n \u0027Where is it?\u0027\n \u0027On its way. But we can\u0027t bring it in until Reacher is down.\u0027\n \u0027Why not?\u0027\n \u0027You know why not. This kind of business can\u0027t be done in public. You should be helping us, not pointing guns at us.\u0027\n The little man didn\u0027t answer.\n Jacob said, \u0027Put the gun away, and let\u0027s all sit down and talk. We\u0027re all on the same side here.\u0027\n The little man kept the gun straight and level and said, \u0027Safir\u0027s men are dead too.\u0027\n \u0027Reacher,\u0027 Jacob said. \u0027He\u0027s on the loose.\u0027\n \u0027What about Rossi\u0027s boys?\u0027\n \u0027We haven\u0027t seen them recently.\u0027\n \u0027Really?\u0027\n \u0027I swear.\u0027\n The little man was quiet for a long moment. Then he said, \u0027OK. Things change. Life moves on, for all of us. From now on you will sell direct to Mahmeini.\u0027\n Jacob Duncan said, \u0027Our arrangement is with Mr Rossi.\u0027\n The little man said, \u0027Not any more.\u0027\n Jacob Duncan didn\u0027t answer.\n Cassano and Mancini opted to try Jacob Duncan\u0027s place first. A logical choice, given that Jacob was clearly the head of the family. They backed off the fence a couple of paces and walked parallel with it to a spot opposite Jacob\u0027s kitchen window. The bar of yellow light coming out of it laid a bright rectangle on the gravel, but it fell six feet short of the base of the fence. They climbed the fence and skirted the rectangle, quietly across the gravel, Cassano to the right, Mancini to the left, and then they flattened themselves against the back wall of the house and peered in.\n No one there.\n Mancini eased open the door and Cassano went in ahead of him. The house was silent. No sound at all. No one awake, no one asleep. Cassano and Mancini had searched plenty of places, plenty of times, and they knew what to listen for.\n They slipped back out to the yard and retraced their steps. They climbed back into the field and walked north in the dark and lined up again opposite Jasper\u0027s window. They climbed the fence and skirted the light. They flattened themselves against the wall and peered inside.\n Not what they expected.\n Not even close.\n There was only one Iranian, not two. There was no happy conversation. No smiles. No bourbon toasts. Instead, Mahmeini\u0027s man was standing there with a gun in one hand and a knife in the other, and all four Duncans were cowering away from him. The glass in the window was wavy and thin in places, and Jacob Duncan\u0027s urgent voice was faintly audible.\n Jacob Duncan was saying, \u0027We have been in business a long time, sir, based on trust and loyalty, and we can\u0027t change things now. Our arrangement is with Mr Rossi, and Mr Rossi alone. Perhaps he can sell direct to you, in the future, now that Mr Safir seems to be out of the picture. Perhaps that might be of advantage. But that\u0027s all we can offer, not that such a thing is even ours to offer.\u0027\n The little man said, \u0027Mahmeini won\u0027t take half a pie when the whole thing is on the table.\u0027\n \u0027But it isn\u0027t on the table. I repeat, we deal with Mr Rossi only.\u0027\n \u0027Do you really?\u0027 the little man asked. He changed his position and stood sideways, and raised his arm level with his shoulder, and closed one eye, and tracked the gun slowly and mechanically back and forth, left and right along the line of men, like a great battleship turret traversing, pausing first on Seth, then on Jasper, then on Jonas, then on Jacob, and then back again, to Jonas, to Jasper, to Seth, and then back again once more. Finally the gun came to rest aimed square at Jonas. Right between his eyes. The little man\u0027s finger whitened on the trigger.\n Then simultaneously the window and the little man\u0027s head exploded, and the crowded room filled with powdered glass and smoke and the massive barking roar of a.45 gunshot, and blood and bone and brain slapped and spattered against the far wall, and the little man fell to the floor, and first Mancini and then Cassano stepped in from the yard.\n After less than an hour the two football players were thoroughly bored with sitting in the dark. And not just bored, either, but unsettled and a little anxious, too, and irritated, and exasperated, and humiliated, because they were very aware that they were being beaten on a minute-to-minute basis, and being beaten on any basis did not come easy to them. They were not submissive people. They never came second. They were the big dogs, and being denied heat and light and NFL highlights was both insulting and totally inappropriate.\n One said, \u0027We have a shotgun, damn it.\u0027\n The other said, \u0027It\u0027s a big basement. He could be anywhere.\u0027\n \u0027We have a flashlight.\u0027\n \u0027Pretty weak.\u0027\n \u0027Maybe he\u0027s still unconscious. It could be an actual fault, and we\u0027re sitting here like idiots.\u0027\n \u0027He has to be awake by now.\u0027\n \u0027So what if he is? He\u0027s one guy, and we have a shotgun and a flashlight.\u0027\n \u0027He was a soldier.\u0027\n \u0027That doesn\u0027t give him magic powers.\u0027\n \u0027How would we do it?\u0027\n \u0027We could tape the flashlight to the shotgun barrel. Go down, single file, like they do in the movies. We\u0027d see him before he sees us.\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027re not supposed to kill him. Seth wants to do that himself, later.\u0027\n \u0027We could aim low. Wound him in the legs.\u0027\n \u0027Or make him surrender. That would be better. And he\u0027d have to, wouldn\u0027t he? With the shotgun and all? We could tape him up, with the tape we use for the flashlight. Then he couldn\u0027t mess with the power again. We should have done that in the first place.\u0027\n \u0027We don\u0027t have any tape, for either thing.\u0027\n \u0027Let\u0027s look in the garage. If we find some tape, we\u0027ll think about doing it.\u0027\n They found some tape. They followed the flashlight beam through the hallway, through the kitchen, through the mud room, all the way to the garage, and right there on the workbench was a fat new roll of silver duct tape, still wrapped up, fresh from the store. They carried it back with them, not really sure if they were pleased or not. But they had promised themselves in a way, so they pulled off the plastic wrap and picked at the end of the tape and unwound a short length. They tried the flashlight against the shotgun barrel, working in the dim light of reflections off the walls. The flashlight fit pretty well, ahead of the forestock, and underslung because of the front sight above the muzzle, and jutting out a little because of its length. The plastic lens was about an inch in front of the gun. Satisfactory. But to get it secure they were going to have to wrap tape right over the thumb switch, which was a point of no return, of sorts. If they were going to do that, then they were going to have to act. No point in leaving the light burning and running the battery down all for nothing.\n One asked, \u0027Well?\u0027\n Three hours before daylight. Boredom, irritation, exasperation, humiliation.\n The other said, \u0027Let\u0027s do it.\u0027\n He propped the gun across his knees and held the flashlight in place. The first guy juggled the roll of tape, making sticky tearing noises, winding it around and around, like he was binding broken ribs with a bandage, until the whole assembly was fat and mummified. He ducked his head and bit off a nine-inch tail and pressed it down securely, and then he squeezed everything hard between his palms, and smoothed the edges of the tape with his fingers. The other guy lifted the gun off his knees and swung it left and right and up and down. The flashlight stayed solidly in place, its beam moving faithfully with the muzzle.\n \u0027OK,\u0027 he said. \u0027Cool. We\u0027re good to go. The light is like a laser sight. Can\u0027t miss.\u0027\n The first guy said, \u0027Remember, aim low. If you see him, jerk the barrel down and fire at his feet.\u0027\n \u0027If he doesn\u0027t surrender first.\u0027\n \u0027Exactly. First choice is to immobilize him. But if he moves, shoot him.\u0027\n \u0027Where will he be?\u0027\n \u0027Could be anywhere. Probably out of sight at the bottom of the stairs. Or hiding behind the water heater. It\u0027s big enough.\u0027\n They followed the light out to the hallway and stopped near the basement door. The guy with the gun said, \u0027You open it and step back and then get behind me. I\u0027ll go down slowly and I\u0027ll move the light around as much as I can. Tell me if you see him. We need to talk each other through this.\u0027\n \u0027OK,\u0027 the first guy said. He put his hand on the knob. \u0027We sure about this?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m ready.\u0027\n \u0027OK, on three. Your count.\u0027\n The guy with the gun said, \u0027One.\u0027\n Then, \u0027Two.\u0027\n The first guy said, \u0027Wait. He could be right behind the door.\u0027\n \u0027At the top of the stairs?\u0027\n \u0027Just waiting to jump out at us before we\u0027re ready.\u0027\n \u0027You think? That would mean he\u0027s been waiting there a whole hour.\u0027\n \u0027Sometimes they wait all day.\u0027\n \u0027Snipers do. This guy wasn\u0027t a sniper.\u0027\n \u0027But it\u0027s possible.\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s probably behind the water heater.\u0027\n \u0027But he might not be.\u0027\n \u0027I could fire through the door.\u0027\n \u0027If he isn\u0027t there, that would alert him.\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027ll be alerted anyway, as soon as he sees the flashlight beam coming down.\u0027\n \u0027The door has a steel core. You heard what Seth said.\u0027\n The guy with the gun asked, \u0027So what do we do?\u0027\n The first guy said, \u0027We could wait for daylight.\u0027\n Boredom, irritation, exasperation, humiliation.\n The guy with the gun said, \u0027No.\u0027\n \u0027OK, so I\u0027ll open up real fast, and you fire one round immediately, right where his feet are. Or where they would be. Just in case. Don\u0027t wait and see. Just pull the trigger, whatever, right away.\u0027\n \u0027OK. But then we\u0027ll have to go down real fast.\u0027\n \u0027We will. He\u0027ll be in shock. I bet that gun is pretty loud. Ready?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m ready.\u0027 The guy with the gun estimated the arc of the swinging door and shuffled a foot closer and braced himself, the stock to his shoulder, one eye closed, his finger tight on the trigger.\n The first guy said, \u0027Aim low.\u0027\n The oval of light settled on the bottom quarter of the door.\n \u0027On three. Your count.\u0027\n \u0027One.\u0027\n \u0027Two.\u0027\n \u0027Three.\u0027\n The first guy turned the knob and flung the door wide open and the second guy fired instantly, with a long tongue of flame and a huge roaring twelve-gauge boom. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-dying-for-jack-reacher-15/page-21.html","bookId":2348,"book":{"id":2348,"title":"Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher #15)","description":"Storyline: \n Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher #15) \n There’s deadly trouble in the corn county of Nebraska . . . and Jack Reacher walks right into it.
