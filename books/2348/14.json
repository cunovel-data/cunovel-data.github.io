{"id":66451,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"THIRTY-ONE THE PHYSICAL SEARCH OF THE AREA WAS DESCRIBED FOUR separate ways, in four separate files, the first from the county PD, the second from the State Police, the third from the National Guard\u0027s helicopter unit, and the fourth from the FBI. The helicopter report was thin and useless. Margaret Coe had been wearing a green dress, which didn\u0027t help in corn country in early summer. And the pilot had stayed above a thousand feet, to stop his downdraught damaging the young plants. Priorities had to be observed in a farm state, even when a kid was missing. Nothing significant had been seen from the air. No freshly turned earth, no flash of pink or chrome from the bike, no flattened stalks in any of the fields. Nothing at all, in fact, except an ocean of corn. A waste of time and aviation fuel. Both the county PD and the State Police had covered the forty farms at ground level. First had come the loudhailer appeals in the dark, and the next day every house had been visited and every occupant had been asked to verify that they hadn\u0027t seen the kid and that they had searched their outbuildings thoroughly. There was near-universal cooperation. Only one old couple confessed they hadn\u0027t checked properly, so the cops searched their place for themselves. Nothing was found. The motel had been visited, every cabin checked, the Dumpster emptied, the lot searched for evidence. Nothing was found. The Duncan compound showed up in three files. Everyone except the helicopter unit had been there. First the county PD had gone in, then the county PD and the State Police together, then the State Police on its own, and then finally the FBI, which had been a lot of visits and a lot of people for such a small place. The searches had been intense, because the smallness of the place had struck people as somehow sinister in itself. Reacher could sense it between the lines, quite clearly, even a quarter-century later. Rural cops. They had been confused and disconcerted. It was almost like the Duncans hated the land. They had stripped away every inch of it they could. They had kept a single track driveway, plus token shoulders, plus a grudging five or ten yards beyond the foundations of their three houses. That was all. That was the whole extent of the place. But the smallness had made it easy to search. The reports were meticulous. The piles of heavy lumber for the half-built fence had been taken apart and examined. Gravel had been raked up, and lines of men had walked slow and bent over, staring at the ground, and the dogs had covered literally every square inch ten times each. Nothing was found. The search moved indoors. As intense as it had been outside, it was twice as thorough inside. Absolutely painstaking. Reacher had searched a lot of places, a lot of times, and he knew how hard it was. But four times in quick succession not a single corner had been cut, and not a single effort had been spared. Stuff had been taken apart, and voids in walls had been opened up, and floors had been lifted. Reacher knew why. Nothing was stated on paper, and nothing was admitted, but again, he could read it right there between the lines. They were looking for a kid, certainly, but by that point they were also looking for parts of a kid. Nothing was found. The FBI contribution was a full-on forensics sweep, 1980s style. It was documented and described at meticulous length on sheets of Bureau paper that had been photocopied and collated and stapled and passed on as a courtesy. Hairs and fibres had been collected, every flat surface had been fingerprinted, all kinds of magic lights and devices and gadgets had been deployed. A corpse-sniffing dog had been flown in from Denver and then sent back again after producing a null result. Technicians with a dozen different specialist expertises had been in and out for twelve solid hours. Nothing was found. Reacher closed the file. He could hear it in his head right then, the same way they must have heard it all those years ago: the sound of a case going cold. Sixty miles north Dorothy Coe was standing at her sink, washing her plate and her knife and her fork and her glass, and scrubbing the oven dish that her chop had cooked in. She dried it all with a thin linen towel and put it all away, the plate and the glass in a cupboard, the silverware in a drawer, the oven dish in another cupboard. She put her napkin in the trash and wiped her table with a rag and pushed her chair in neatly. Then she stepped out to her front parlour. She intended to sit a spell, and then go to bed, and then get up early and drive to the motel. Maybe she could help Mr Vincent fix the mirror behind his bar. Maybe she could even glue the handle back on his NASA mug. Reacher sat a spell on the floor in his Marriott room, thinking. It was ten o\u0027clock in the evening. His job was done, two hours ahead of his pretended midnight schedule. He got to his feet and packed up all eleven cartons and folded their flaps into place. He stacked them neatly in the centre of the floor, two piles of four and one of three. He dialled nine for a line, from the bedside table, and then he dialled the switchboard number he remembered from the transcript of Dorothy Coe\u0027s original panic call, twenty-five years earlier. It was still an active number. It was answered. Reacher asked for Hoag, not really expecting to get him, but there was a click and a second of dead air and then the guy himself came on. \u0027I\u0027m done,\u0027 Reacher told him. \u0027Find anything?\u0027 \u0027You guys did a fine job. Nothing for you to worry about. So I\u0027m moving out.\u0027 \u0027So soon? You\u0027re not staying for the nightlife?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m a simple soul. I like peace and quiet.\u0027 \u0027OK, leave the stuff right there. We\u0027ll swing by and pick it up. We\u0027ll have it back in the basement before the file jockeys even get in tomorrow. They\u0027ll never know a thing. Mission accomplished.\u0027 \u0027I owe you,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027Forget it,\u0027 Hoag said. \u0027Be all you can be, and all that shit.\u0027 \u0027The chance would be a fine thing,\u0027 Reacher said. He hung up and grabbed his coat and headed for the door. He was way in the back of the H-shaped layout, and he had to walk all the way forward to the lobby before getting outside and looping back around to where his car was parked. The stairs came down from the second floor just before the lobby, in a space that would have been another room in the wing, if it had been a one-storey structure. Just as Reacher got to them, a guy stepped off the last stair and fell in alongside him, heading the same way, to the lobby, to the door. He was one of the guys Reacher had seen checking in at the desk. Small and rumpled. Unshaven. Iranian, possibly. The guy glanced across. Reacher nodded politely. The guy nodded back. They walked on together. The guy had car keys swinging from his finger. A red tag. Avis. The guy glanced at Reacher again, up and across. Reacher glanced back. He held the door. The guy stepped out. Reacher followed. The guy looked at him again. Some kind of speculation in his eyes. Some kind of intense curiosity. Reacher stepped left, to loop around the length of the H on the outside. The Iranian guy stayed with him. Which made some kind of possible sense, after Reacher glanced ahead and saw two cars parked back there. Seth Duncan\u0027s Cadillac, and a dark blue Chevrolet. Prime rental material. Avis probably had thousands of them. A dark blue Chevrolet. Reacher stopped. The other guy stopped. THIRTY-TWO NOBODY KNOWS HOW LONG IT TAKES FOR THOUGHTS TO FORM. People talk about electrical impulses racing through nerves at a substantial fraction of the speed of light, but that\u0027s mere transmission. That\u0027s mail delivery. The letter is written in the brain, sparked to life by some sudden damp chemical reaction, two compounds arcing across synapses and reacting like lead and acid in an automobile battery, but instead of sending twelve dumb volts to a turn signal the brain floods the body with all kinds of subtle adjustments all at once, because thoughts don\u0027t necessarily happen one at a time. They come in starbursts and waterfalls and explosions and they race away on parallel tracks, jostling, competing, fighting for supremacy. Reacher saw the dark blue Chevrolet and instantly linked it through Vincent\u0027s testimony back at the motel to the two men he had seen from Dorothy Coe\u0027s barn, while simultaneously critiquing the connection, in that Chevrolets were very common cars and dark blue was a very common colour, while simultaneously recalling the two matched Iranians and the two matched Arabs he had seen, and asking himself whether the rendezvous of two separate pairs of strange men in winter in a Nebraska hotel could be just a coincidence, and if indeed it wasn\u0027t, whether it might then reasonably imply the presence of a third pair of men, which might or might not be the two tough guys from Dorothy\u0027s farm, however inexplicable those six men\u0027s association might be, however mysterious their purpose, while simultaneously watching the man in front of him dropping his car key, and moving his arm, and putting his hand in his coat pocket, while simultaneously realizing that the guys he had seen on Dorothy\u0027s farm had not been staying at Vincent\u0027s motel, and that there was nowhere else to stay except right there, sixty miles south at the Marriott, which meant that the Chevrolet was likely theirs, at least within the bounds of reasonable possibility, which meant that the Iranian with the moving arm was likely connected with them in some way, which made the guy an enemy, although Reacher had no idea how or why, while simultaneously knowing that likely didn\u0027t mean shit in terms of civilian jurisprudence, while simultaneously recalling years of hard-won experience that told him men like this Iranian went for their pockets in dark parking lots for one of only four reasons, either to pull out a cell phone to call for help, or to pull out a wallet or a passport or an ID to prove their innocence or their authority, or to pull out a knife, or to pull out a gun. Reacher knew all that, while also knowing that violent reaction ahead of the first two reasons would be inexcusable, but that violent reaction ahead of the latter two reasons would be the only way to save his life. Starbursts and waterfalls and explosions of thoughts, all jostling and competing and fighting for supremacy. Better safe than sorry. Reacher reacted. He twisted from the waist in a violent spasm and started a low sidearm punch aimed at the centre of the Iranian\u0027s chest. Chemical reaction in his brain, instantaneous transmission of the impulse, chemical reaction in every muscle system from his left foot to his right fist, total elapsed time a small fraction of a second, total distance to target less than a yard, total time to target another small fraction of a second, which was good to know right then, because the guy\u0027s hand was all the way in his pocket by that point, his own nervous system reacting just as fast as Reacher\u0027s, his elbow jerking up and back and trying to free whatever the hell it was he wanted, be it a knife, or a gun, or a phone, or a driver\u0027s licence, or a passport, or a government ID, or a perfectly innocent letter from the University of Tehran proving he was a world expert on plant genetics and an honoured guest in Nebraska just days away from increasing local profits a hundredfold and eliminating world hunger at one fell swoop. But right or wrong Reacher\u0027s fist was homing in regardless and the guy\u0027s eyes were going wide and panicked in the gloom and his arm was jerking harder and the brown skin and the black hair on the back of his moving hand was showing above the hem of his pocket, and then came his knuckles, all five of them bunched and knotted because his fingers were clamping hard around something big and black. Then Reacher\u0027s blow landed. Two hundred and fifty pounds of moving mass, a huge fist, a huge impact, the zipper of the guy\u0027s coat driving backward into his breastbone, his breastbone driving backward into his chest cavity, the natural elasticity of his ribcage letting it yield whole inches, the resulting violent compression driving the air from his lungs, the hydrostatic shock driving blood back into his heart, his head snapping forward like a crash test dummy, his shoulders driving backward, his weight coming up off the ground, his head whipping backward again and hitting a plate glass window behind him with a dull boom like a kettle drum, his arms and legs and torso all going down like a rag doll, his body falling, sprawling, the hard polycarbonate click and clatter of something black skittering away on the ground, Reacher tracking it all the way in the corner of his eye, not a wallet, not a phone, not a knife, but a Glock 17 semi-automatic pistol, all dark and boxy and wicked. It ended up six or eight feet away from the guy, completely out of his reach, safe, not retrievable, partly because of the distance itself and partly because the guy was down and he wasn\u0027t moving at all. In fact he was looking like he might never move again. Something Reacher had heard about, but never actually seen. His army medic friends had called it commotio cordis, their name for low-energy trauma to the chest wall. Low energy only in the sense that the damage wasn\u0027t done by a car wreck or a shotgun blast, but by a line drive in baseball or a football collision or a punch in a fight or a bad fall on to a blunt object. Gruesome research on laboratory animals proved it was all about luck and timing. Electrocardiograms showed waveforms associated with the beating of the heart, one of which was called the T-wave, and the experiments showed that if the blow landed when the T-wave was between fifteen and thirty milliseconds short of its peak, then lethal cardiac dysrhythmia could occur, stopping the heart just like a regular heart attack. And in a high-stress environment like a confrontation in a parking lot, a guy\u0027s heart was pounding away much harder than normal and therefore it was bringing those T-wave peaks around much faster than usual, as many as two or possibly three times a second, thereby dramatically increasing the odds that the luck and the timing would be bad, not good. The Iranian lay completely still. Not breathing. No visible pulse. No signs of life. The standard first-aid remedies taught by the army medics were artificial respiration and external chest compressions, eighty beats a minute, as long as it took, but Reacher\u0027s personal rule of thumb was never to revive a guy who had just pulled a gun on him. He was fairly inflexible on the matter. So he let nature take its course for a minute, and then he helped it along a little with heavy pressure from his finger and thumb on the big arteries in the guy\u0027s neck. Four minutes without oxygen to the brain was reckoned to be the practical limit. Reacher gave it five, just to be certain, squatting there, looking around, listening hard. No one reacted. No one came. The Iranian died, the slack tensions of deep unconsciousness fading away, the absolute soft limpness of recent death replacing them. Reacher stood up and found the car key and picked up the Glock. The key was marked with the Chevrolet stove bolt logo, but it wasn\u0027t for the blue car. Reacher stabbed the unlock button and nothing happened. The Glock was close to new and fully loaded, seventeen bright nine-millimetre Parabellums in the magazine and one in the chamber. Reacher put it in his pocket with his screwdrivers. He walked back to the front lot and tried again with the key. A yellow Chevy Malibu answered him. It flashed all four of its turn signals and unlocked all four of its doors. It was new and plain and clean. An obvious rental. He got in and pushed the seat back and started it up. The tank was close to full. There were rental papers in the door pocket, dated that day and made out to a Las Vegas corporation under a name that communicated nothing. There were bottles of water in the cup holders, one part-used, one unopened. Reacher backed out of the slot and drove around to the back of the H and stopped with the dead guy between the wall and the car. He found the remote button and popped the trunk. He got out and checked the space. It was not a very big opening and not a very big trunk, but then, the Iranian was not a very big guy. Reacher bent down and went through the Iranian\u0027s pockets. He found a phone and a knife and a wallet and a handkerchief and about a dollar in coins. He left the coins and stripped the battery out of the phone and put the battery back in one of the dead guy\u0027s pockets and the rest of the phone in another. The knife was a switchblade with a pearl handle. Heavy, solid, and sharp. A decent implement. He put it in his own pocket, with his adjustable wrench. He checked the wallet. It held close to four hundred bucks in cash, plus three credit cards, plus a driver\u0027s licence from the state of Nevada made out to a guy named Asghar Arad Sepehr at a Las Vegas address. The photograph was plausible. The credit cards were in the same name. The cash was mostly twenties, crisp and fresh and fragrant, straight from an ATM. Reacher kept the cash and wiped the wallet with the handkerchief and put it back in the dead guy\u0027s pocket. Then he hoisted him up, two hands, collar and belt, and turned and made ready to fold him into the yellow Malibu\u0027s trunk. Then he stopped. He got a better idea. He carried the guy over to Seth Duncan\u0027s Cadillac and laid him gently on the ground. He found the Cadillac key in his pocket and opened the trunk and picked the guy up again and put him inside. An old-fashioned turnpike cruiser. A big trunk. Plenty of space. He closed the lid on the guy. He opened the driver\u0027s door and used the handkerchief to wipe everything he had touched that day, the wheel, the gearshift, the mirror, the radio knobs, the door handles inside and out. Then he blipped the remote and locked up again and walked away, back to the Malibu. It was yellow, but apart from that it was fairly anonymous. Domestic brand, local plates, conventional shape. Probably less conspicuous out on the open road than the Cadillac, despite the garish colour. And probably less likely to be reported stolen. Out-of-state guys with guns and knives in their pockets generally kept a lot quieter than outraged local citizens. He checked left, checked right, checked behind, checked ahead. All quiet. Just cold air and silence and stillness and a night mist falling. He got back in the Malibu and kept the headlights off and turned around and nosed slowly out of the lot. He drove the length of McNally Street and paused. To the left was I-80, sixty miles south, a fast six-lane highway, a straight shot east all the way to Virginia. To the right were the forty farms, and the Duncans, and the Apollo Inn, and Eleanor, and the doctor and his wife, and Dorothy Coe, all of them sixty miles north. Decision time. Left or right? South or north? He flicked the headlights on and turned right and headed back north. THIRTY-THREE THE DUNCANS HAD MOVED FROM JONAS DUNCAN\u0027S KITCHEN TO Jasper\u0027s, because Jasper still had a mostly full bottle of Knob Creek in his cupboard. All four men were around the table, elbow to elbow, amber half-inches of bourbon in thick chipped glasses set out in front of them. They were sipping slow and talking low. Their latest shipment was somewhere between twelve and twenty-four hours away. Usually a time for celebration. Like the night before Christmas. But this time they were a little subdued. Jonas asked, \u0027Where do you suppose it is right now?\u0027 \u0027Parked up for the night,\u0027 Jacob said. \u0027At least I hope so. Close to the border, but waiting for daylight. Prudence is the key now.\u0027 \u0027Five hundred miles,\u0027 Jonas said. \u0027Crossing time plus ten hours, maybe. Plus contingencies.\u0027 Jasper asked, \u0027How long do you suppose it takes to read a police file?\u0027 \u0027Good question,\u0027 Jacob said. \u0027I\u0027ve been giving it a little thought, naturally. It must be a very big file. And it must be stored away somewhere. Let\u0027s say government workers start at nine in the morning. Let\u0027s say they quit at five. Let\u0027s say there\u0027s some measure of bureaucracy involved in gaining access to the file. So let\u0027s say noon tomorrow would be a practical starting point. That would give him five hours tomorrow, and maybe the full eight on the day after. That might be enough.\u0027 \u0027So he won\u0027t come back for forty-eight hours at least.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m only guessing. I can\u0027t be sure.\u0027 \u0027Even so. We\u0027ll have plenty of margin.\u0027 Seth Duncan said, \u0027He won\u0027t come back at all. Why would he? A hundred people read that file and said there was nothing wrong with it. And this guy isn\u0027t a hundred times smarter than anyone else. He can\u0027t be.\u0027 Nobody spoke. Seth said, \u0027What?\u0027 His father said, \u0027He doesn\u0027t have to be smarter than anyone else, son. Certainly not a hundred times smarter. He just has to be smart in a different way. Lateral, is what they call it.\u0027 \u0027But there\u0027s no evidence. We all know that.\u0027 \u0027I agree,\u0027 Jacob said. \u0027But that\u0027s the damn point. It\u0027s not about what\u0027s in the file. It\u0027s about what isn\u0027t in the file.\u0027 The Malibu was like half a Cadillac. Four cylinders instead of eight, one ton instead of two, and about half as long. But it worked OK. It was cruising nicely. Not that Reacher was paying much attention to it. He was thinking about the dead Iranian, and the odds against hitting a T-wave window. The guy had been small, built like a bird, and Reacher tended to assume that people opposite him on the physical spectrum were also opposite him on the personality spectrum, so that in place of his own placid nature he imagined the guy was all strung out and nervous, which might have meant that back there in the parking lot the guy\u0027s heart was going as fast as 180 beats a minute, which meant those T-waves were coming around fast and furious, three times a second, which meant that the odds of hitting one of those crucial fifteen-millisecond windows ahead of a peak were about forty-five in a thousand, or a little better than one in twenty. Unlucky. For the Iranian, certainly. But no cause for major regret. Most likely Reacher would have had to put him down anyway, one way or another, sooner or later, probably within just a few more heartbeats. It would have been practically inevitable. Once a gun was pulled, there were very few other available options. But still, it had been a first. And a last, probably, at least for a spell. Because Reacher was pretty sure the next guy he met would be a football player. He figured the Duncans knew he had gone out of town, possibly for a day, possibly for ever. He figured they would have gotten hold of the doctor long ago and squeezed that news out of him. And they were realistic but cautious people. They would have stood down five of their boys for the night, and left just one lone sentry to the south. And that one lone sentry would have to be dealt with. But not via commotio cordis. Reacher wasn\u0027t about to aim a wild punch at a Cornhusker\u0027s centre mass. Not in this lifetime. He would break his hand. He kept the Malibu humming along, eight miles, nine, and then he started looking ahead for the bar he had seen on the shoulder. The small wooden building. The Cell Block. Maybe just outside the city limit. Unincorporated land. Maybe a question of licensing or regulation. There was mist in the air and the Malibu\u0027s headlights made crisp little tunnels. Then they were answered by a glow in the air. A halo, far ahead on the left. Neon, in kelly green, and red, and blue. Beer signs. Plus yellow tungsten from a couple of token spots in the parking lot. Reacher slowed and pulled in and parked his yellow car next to a pick-up that was mostly brown with corrosion. He got out and locked up and headed for the door. From close up the place looked nothing at all like a prison. It was just a shack. It could once have been a house or a store. Even the sign was written wrong. The words Cell Block were stencilled like a notation on an electrician\u0027s blueprint. Like something technological. There was noise inside, the warm low hubbub and hoo-hah of a half-empty late-evening bar in full swing, plus a little music under it, probably from a jukebox, a tune Reacher didn\u0027t recognize but was prepared to like. He went in. The door opened directly in the left front corner of the main public room. The bar ran front to back on the right, and there were tables and chairs on the left. There were maybe twenty people in the room, mostly men. The decoration scheme was really no scheme at all. Wooden tables, wheelback chairs, bar stools, board floor. There was no prison theme. In fact the electronic visuals from outside were continued inside. The stencilled words Cell Block were repeated on the bar back, flanked by foil-covered cut-outs of radio towers with lightning bolts coming out of them. Reacher threaded sideways between tables and caught the barman\u0027s eye and the barman shuffled left to meet him. The guy was young, and his face was open and friendly. He said, \u0027You look confused.\u0027 Reacher said, \u0027I guess I was expecting bars on the windows, maybe booths in the old cells. I thought maybe you would be wearing a suit with arrows all over it.\u0027 The guy didn\u0027t answer. \u0027Like an old prison,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027Like a cell block.\u0027 The guy stayed blank for a second, and then he smiled. \u0027Not that kind of cell block,\u0027 he said. \u0027Take out your phone.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t have a phone.\u0027 \u0027Well, if you did, you\u0027d find it wouldn\u0027t work here. No signal. There\u0027s a null zone about a mile wide. That\u0027s why people come here. For a little undisturbed peace and quiet.\u0027 \u0027They can\u0027t just not answer?\u0027 \u0027Human nature doesn\u0027t really work that way, does it? People can\u0027t ignore a ringing phone. It\u0027s about guilty consciences. You know, wives or bosses. All kinds of hassle. Better that their phones don\u0027t ring at all.\u0027 \u0027So do you have a pay phone here? Strictly for emergencies?\u0027 The guy pointed. \u0027Back corridor.\u0027 \u0027Thanks,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027That\u0027s why I came in.\u0027 He threaded down the line of stools, some of them occupied, some of them not, and he found an opening that led to the restrooms and a rear door. There was a pay phone on the wall opposite the ladies\u0027 room. It was mounted on a cork rectangle that was dark and stained with age and marked with scribbled numbers in faded ink. He checked his pockets for quarters and found five. He wished he had kept the Iranian\u0027s coins. He dialled the same number he had used a quarter of an hour ago, and Dorothy Coe had used a quarter of a century ago. The call was answered and he asked for Hoag, and he was connected inside ten short seconds. \u0027One more favour,\u0027 he said. \u0027You got phone books for the whole county, right?\u0027 Hoag said, \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027I need a number for a guy called Seth Duncan, about sixty miles north of you.\u0027 \u0027Wait one,\u0027 Hoag said. Reacher heard the click and patter of a keyboard. A computer database, not a paper book. Hoag said, \u0027That\u0027s an unlisted number.\u0027 \u0027Unlisted as in you don\u0027t have it, or as in you can see it but you won\u0027t tell me?\u0027 \u0027Unlisted as in please don\u0027t ask me, because you\u0027ll be putting me on the spot.\u0027 \u0027OK, I won\u0027t ask you. Anything under Eleanor Duncan?\u0027 \u0027No. There are four Duncans, all male names. All unlisted.\u0027 \u0027So give me the doctor instead.\u0027 \u0027What doctor?\u0027 \u0027The local guy up there.\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s his name?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027I don\u0027t have his name.\u0027 \u0027Then I can\u0027t help you. This thing is purely alphabetical by last name. It\u0027s going to say Smith, Dr Bill, or whatever. Something like that. In very small letters.\u0027 \u0027Got to be a contact number for a doctor. There might be an emergency. Got to be some way of getting hold of the guy.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t see anything.\u0027 \u0027Wait,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027I know how. Give me the Apollo Inn.\u0027 \u0027Apollo like the space rocket?\u0027 \u0027Exactly like the space rocket.\u0027 The keyboard pattered and Hoag read out a number, a 308 area code for the western part of the state, and then seven more digits. Reacher repeated them once in his head and said, \u0027Thanks,\u0027 and hung up and redialled. Ten miles south, Mahmeini\u0027s man was dialling too, calling home. He got Mahmeini on his cell, and said, \u0027We have a problem.\u0027 Mahmeini said, \u0027Specifically?\u0027 \u0027Asghar has run out on us.\u0027 \u0027Impossible.\u0027 \u0027Well, he has. I sent him down to the car to get me a bottle of water. He didn\u0027t come back, so I checked. The car is gone, and he\u0027s gone too.\u0027 \u0027Call him.\u0027 \u0027I tried ten times. His phone is off.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t believe it.\u0027 \u0027What do you want me to do?\u0027 \u0027I want you to find him.\u0027 \u0027I have no idea where to look.\u0027 Mahmeini said, \u0027He drinks, you know.\u0027 \u0027I know. But there\u0027s no bar in town. Just a liquor store. And it will be closed by now. And he wouldn\u0027t have driven to the liquor store anyway. He would have walked. It\u0027s only about three blocks away.\u0027 \u0027There must be a bar. This is America. Ask the concierge.\u0027 \u0027There is no concierge. This isn\u0027t the Bellagio. They don\u0027t even put water in the rooms.\u0027 \u0027There must be someone at the desk. Ask him.\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t go anywhere. I don\u0027t have a car. And I can\u0027t ask the others for help. Not now. That would be an admission of weakness.\u0027 \u0027Find a way,\u0027 Mahmeini said. \u0027Find a bar, and find a way of getting there. That\u0027s an order.\u0027 Reacher listened to the ring tone. It was loud and sonorous and resonant in his ear, the product of a big old-fashioned earpiece maybe an inch and a half across, buried deep inside a big old-fashioned plastic handset that probably weighed a pound. He pictured the two phones ringing in the motel, fifty miles north, one at the desk, one behind the bar. Or maybe there were more than two phones. Maybe there was a third extension in a back office, and a fourth in Vincent\u0027s private quarters. Maybe the whole place was a regular rats\u0027 nest of wiring, just like the inside of a lunar module. But however many phones there were, they all rang for a long period, and then one of them was answered. Vincent came on and said, \u0027This is the Apollo Inn,\u0027 just like Reacher had heard him say it before, very brightly and enthusiastically, like it was a brand new establishment taking its first-ever call on its first-ever night in business. Reacher said, \u0027I need Eleanor Duncan\u0027s phone number.\u0027 Vincent said, \u0027Reacher? Where are you?\u0027 \u0027Still out of town. I need Eleanor\u0027s number.\u0027 \u0027Are you coming back?\u0027 \u0027What could possibly keep me away?\u0027 \u0027Are you not going to Virginia?\u0027 \u0027Eventually, I hope.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t have Eleanor\u0027s number.\u0027 \u0027Isn\u0027t she on the phone tree?\u0027 \u0027No, how could she be? Seth might answer.\u0027 \u0027OK, is the doctor there?\u0027 \u0027Not right now.\u0027 \u0027Slow night, then.\u0027 \u0027Unfortunately.\u0027 \u0027Do you have his number?\u0027 \u0027Hold the line,\u0027 Vincent said. There was a thump as he put the handset down, maybe on the bar, and then a pause, just about long enough for him to walk across the lounge, and then the sound of a second handset being raised, maybe at the desk. The two open lines picked up on each other and Reacher heard the room\u0027s slow echo hissing and bouncing off the round domed ceiling. Vincent read out a number, the area code and seven more digits, and Reacher repeated them once in his head and said, \u0027Thanks,\u0027 and hung up and redialled. The guy at the Marriott\u0027s desk told Mahmeini\u0027s man that yes, there was a bar, not exactly in town but ten miles north, just outside the city limit, on the left shoulder of the two-lane, called the Cell Block, a pleasant place, reasonably priced, and that yes, it was usually open late, and that yes, there was a taxi service in town, and that yes, he would be happy to call a cab immediately. And so less than five minutes later Mahmeini\u0027s man was sliding across stained vinyl into the rear seat of an ancient Chevy Caprice, and the driver was pulling out of the lot, and heading down McNally Street, and making the right at the end. The doctor answered a lot faster than Vincent had. Reacher said, \u0027I need Eleanor Duncan\u0027s phone number.\u0027 The doctor said, \u0027Reacher? Where are you?\u0027 \u0027Still out of town.\u0027 \u0027Are you coming back?\u0027 \u0027What, are you missing me?\u0027 \u0027I didn\u0027t tell the Duncans about the Cadillac.\u0027 \u0027Good man. Has Seth gone home yet?\u0027 \u0027He was still with his father when I left.\u0027 \u0027Will he stay?\u0027 \u0027People say he often does.\u0027 \u0027You OK?\u0027 \u0027Not too bad. I was in the truck. The Cornhuskers got me.\u0027 \u0027And?\u0027 \u0027Nothing much. Just words, really.\u0027 Reacher pictured the guy, maybe standing in his hallway or his kitchen, quaking, shaking, watching the windows, checking the doors. He asked, \u0027Are you sober?\u0027 The doctor said, \u0027A little.\u0027 \u0027A little?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s about as good as it gets these days, I\u0027m afraid.\u0027 \u0027I need Eleanor Duncan\u0027s number.\u0027 \u0027She\u0027s not listed.\u0027 \u0027I know that.\u0027 \u0027She\u0027s not on the phone tree.\u0027 \u0027But she\u0027s your patient.\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t.\u0027 \u0027How much more trouble could you be in?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s not just that. There are confidentiality issues too. I\u0027m a doctor. Like you said, I took an oath.\u0027 \u0027We\u0027re making an omelette here,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027We\u0027re going to have to break some eggs.\u0027 \u0027They\u0027ll know it came from me.\u0027 \u0027If it comes to it I\u0027ll tell them different.\u0027 The doctor went quiet, and then he sighed, and then he recited a number. \u0027Thanks,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027Take care. Best to your wife.\u0027 He hung up and redialled and listened to yet more ring tone, the same languid electronic purr, but this time from a different place, from somewhere inside the restored farmhouse, among the pastel colours and the fancy rugs and the oil paintings. He figured that if Seth was home, then Seth would answer. It seemed to be that kind of a relationship. But he bet himself a buck Seth wasn\u0027t home. The Duncans were in two kinds of trouble, and Reacher\u0027s experience told him they would huddle together until it passed. So Eleanor was probably home alone, and would pick up. Or not. Maybe she would just ignore the bell, whatever the barman thirty feet away thought about human nature. She picked up. \u0027Hello?\u0027 she said. Reacher asked, \u0027Is Seth there?\u0027 \u0027Reacher? Where are you?\u0027 \u0027Doesn\u0027t matter where I am. Where\u0027s Seth?\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s at his father\u0027s. I don\u0027t expect him home tonight.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s good. You still up and dressed?\u0027 \u0027Why?\u0027 \u0027I want you to do something for me.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-dying-for-jack-reacher-15/page-14.html","bookId":2348,"book":{"id":2348,"title":"Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher #15)","description":"Storyline: Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher #15) There’s deadly trouble in the corn county of Nebraska . . . and Jack Reacher walks right into it.

The Duncans want Reacher gone—and it’s not just past secrets they’re trying to hide. For as dangerous as the Duncans are, they’re just the bottom of a criminal food chain stretching halfway around the world.
