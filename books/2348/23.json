It slowed to a walk and passed behind the parked Cornhusker pick-up, and then it rolled on and passed behind the parked SUV. Then it turned and nosed into the driveway, with a crunch and a squelch from its wheels on the gravel, and then it stopped.\\n\\n And then Reacher saw it.\\n\\n There was enough light scatter and enough reflection to identify it. It was the dark blue Chevrolet. The Italians. Reacher picked up the Remington. The car stayed where it was. No one got out. It was sixty yards away, half in and half out of the driveway mouth. Just sitting there, lights on, idling. A tactical problem. Reacher had three innocent non-combatants in a wood-frame house. There were two parked cars on the driveway and two on the road, for cover. There were two opponents and the house had windows and a door both front and back.\\n\\n Not ideal conditions for a gun battle.\\n\\n Best hope would be for the Italians to approach the front door on foot. Game over, right there. Reacher could swing the door open and fire point blank. But the Italians weren\u0027t approaching on foot. They were just sitting in the car. Doing nothing. Talking, maybe. And scouting around. Reacher could see dim flashes of white as necks craned and heads turned. They were discussing something.\\n\\n Angelo Mancini was saying, \u0027This is a waste of time. He ain\u0027t in there. He can\u0027t be. Not unless he\u0027s hanging out with three of their football players.\u0027\\n\\n Roberto Cassano nodded. He glanced over his shoulder at the pick-up truck and the SUV on the shoulder, and then he glanced ahead at the gold GMC Yukon on the driveway. It was parked in front of an older truck. He said, \u0027That\u0027s the old woman\u0027s ride, from the farm.\u0027\\n\\n Mancini said, \u0027Sleepover time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I guess Mahmeini\u0027s boy was right about something. They know the doctor is the weak link. They\u0027ve got him staked out.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not much of a trap, all things considered. Not with their cars parked out front. No one is going to walk into that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Which is good for us, in a way. They\u0027re wasting their resources. Which gives us a better chance somewhere else.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you want to check here? Just in case?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s the point? If he\u0027s in there, he\u0027s already their prisoner.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s what I was thinking. But then I thought, not necessarily. They could be his prisoner.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027One against three?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You saw what he did to the guy in the Cadillac\u0027s trunk.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. I kind of want to check, I guess. And maybe we should. But you heard the man. This is a competition now. We can\u0027t waste time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Wouldn\u0027t take much time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know. But we\u0027ll look like idiots if he\u0027s not in there. The football players will be straight on the phone to the Duncans, all yukking it up about how we came looking in a place he couldn\u0027t possibly be.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No one said there are style points involved.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But there are. There are always style points involved. This is a long game. There\u0027s a lot of money involved. If we lose face we\u0027ll never get it back.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So where?\u0027\\n\\n Cassano looked again at the old woman\u0027s truck. \u0027If she\u0027s here, then her house is empty tonight. And people looking for places to hide love empty houses.\u0027\\n\\n Reacher saw them back out and drive away again. At first he didn\u0027t understand why. Then he concluded they were looking for Seth Duncan. They had pulled up, they had eyeballed the parked cars, they had seen that the Mazda wasn\u0027t among them, and they had gone away again. Logical. He put the Remington back on the floor, and planted his feet, and straightened his back, and stared out into the darkness.\\n\\n Nothing else happened for ninety long minutes. No one came, no one stirred. Then pale streaks of dawn started showing in the sky to Reacher\u0027s right. They came in low and silver and purple, and the land slowly lightened from black to grey, and the world once again took solid shape, all the way to the far horizon. Rags of tattered cloud lit up bright overhead, and a knee-high mist rose up off the dirt. A new day. But not a good one, Reacher thought. It was going to be a day full of pain, both for those who deserved it, and for those who didn\u0027t.\\n\\n He waited.\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t get his Yukon out, because he had no key for Dorothy Coe\u0027s pick-up truck. It was possibly in her coat, but he wasn\u0027t inclined to go look for it. He was in no hurry. It was wintertime. Full daylight was still an hour away.\\n\\n Five hundred miles due north, up in Canada, just above the 49th Parallel, because of the latitude, dawn came a little later. The first of the morning light filtered down through the needles of the towering pine and touched the white van in its summer picnic spot at the end of the rough grassy track. The driver woke in his seat, and blinked, and stretched. He had heard nothing all night long. He had seen nothing. No bears, no coyotes, no red foxes, no moose, no elk, no wolves. No people. He had been warm, because he had a sleeping bag filled with down, but he had been very uncomfortable, because panel vans had small cabs, and he had spent the night folded into a seat that didn\u0027t recline very far. It was always on his mind that the cargo in the back was treated better than he was. It rode more comfortably. But then, it was expensive and hard to get, and he wasn\u0027t. He was a realistic man. He knew how things worked.\\n\\n He climbed out and took a leak against the pine\u0027s ancient trunk. Then he ate and drank from his meagre supplies, and he pushed his palms against his aching back, and he stretched again to work out the kinks. The sky was brightening. It was his favourite time for a run to the border. Light enough to see, too early for company. Ideal. He had just twenty miles to go, most of them on an unmapped forest track, to a point a little less than four thousand yards north of the line. The transfer zone, he called it. The end of the road for him, but not for his cargo.\\n\\n He climbed back in the cab and started the engine. He let it warm and settle for a minute while he checked the dials and the gauges. Then he selected first gear, and released the parking brake, and turned the wheel, and moved away slowly, at walking speed, lurching and bouncing down the rough grassy track.\\n\\n Reacher heard sounds at the end of the hallway. A toilet flushing, a faucet running, a door opening, a door closing. Then the doctor came limping past the dining room, stiff with sleep, mute with morning. He nodded as he passed, and he skirted the football players, and he headed for the kitchen. A minute later Reacher heard the gulp and hiss of the coffee machine. The sun was up enough to show a reflection in the window of the SUV parked beyond the fence. Webs of frost were glinting and glittering in the fields.\\n\\n The doctor came in with two mugs of coffee. He was dressed in a sweater over pyjamas. His hair was uncombed. The damage on his face was lost in general redness. He put one mug in front of Reacher and threaded his way around and sat in a chair on the opposite side of the table.\\n\\n He said, \u0027Good morning.\u0027\\n\\n Reacher said nothing.\\n\\n The doctor asked, \u0027How\u0027s your nose?\u0027\\n\\n Reacher said, \u0027Terrific.\u0027\\n\\n The doctor said, \u0027There\u0027s something you never told me.\u0027\\n\\n Reacher said, \u0027There are many things I never told you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You said twenty-five years ago the detective neglected to search somewhere. You said because of ignorance or confusion.\u0027\\n\\n Reacher nodded, and took a sip of his coffee.\\n\\n The doctor asked, \u0027Is that where you\u0027re going this morning?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, it is.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Will you find anything there after twenty-five years?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Probably not.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then why are you going?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because I don\u0027t believe in ghosts.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t follow.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I hope you never have to. I hope I\u0027m wrong.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where is this place we\u0027re talking about?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mrs Coe told me that fifty years ago two farms were sold for a development that never happened. The outbuildings from one of them are still there. Way out in a field. A barn, and a smaller shed.\u0027\\n\\n The doctor nodded. \u0027I know where they are.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027People plough right up to them.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know,\u0027 the doctor said. \u0027I guess they shouldn\u0027t, but why let good land go to waste? The subdivisions were never built, and they\u0027re never going to be. So it\u0027s something for nothing, and God knows these people need it. It\u0027s yield that doesn\u0027t show up on their mortgages.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So when Detective Carson came up here twenty-five years ago, what did he see? In the early summer? He saw about a million acres of waist-high corn, and he saw some houses dotted around here and there, and he saw some outbuildings dotted around here and there. He stopped in at every house, and every occupant said they\u0027d searched their outbuildings. So Carson went away again, and that old barn and that old shed fell right between the cracks. Because Carson\u0027s question was, did you search your outbuildings? Everyone said yes, probably quite truthfully. And Carson saw the old barn and the old shed and quite naturally assumed they must belong to someone, and that therefore they had indeed been looked at, as promised. But they didn\u0027t belong to anyone, and they hadn\u0027t been looked at.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You think that was the scene of the crime?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think Carson should have asked that question twenty-five years ago.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There won\u0027t be anything there. There can\u0027t be. Those buildings are ruins now, and they must have been ruins then. They\u0027ve been sitting there empty for fifty years, in the middle of nowhere, just mouldering away.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Have they?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course. You said it yourself, they don\u0027t belong to anyone.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then why have they got wheel ruts all the way to the door?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Have they?\u0027\\n\\n Reacher nodded. \u0027I hid a truck in the smaller shed my first night. No problem getting there. I\u0027ve seen worse roads in New York City.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Old ruts? Or new ruts?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hard to tell. Both, probably. Many years\u0027 worth, I would say. Quite deep, quite well established. No weeds. Not much traffic, probably, but some. Some kind of regularity. Enough to keep the ruts in shape, anyway.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t understand. Who would use those places now? And for what?\u0027\\n\\n Reacher said nothing. He was looking out the window. The light was getting stronger. The fields were turning from grey to brown. The parked pick-up beyond the fence was all lit up by a low ray.\\n\\n The doctor asked, \u0027So you think someone scooped the kid up and drove her to that barn?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not sure any more,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027They were harvesting alfalfa at the time, and there will have been plenty of trucks on the road. And I\u0027m guessing this whole place felt a bit happier back then. More energetic. People doing this and that, going here and there. The roads were probably a little busier than they are now. Probably a lot busier. Maybe even too busy to risk scooping a kid up against her will in broad daylight.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So what do you think happened to her?\u0027\\n\\n Reacher didn\u0027t answer. He was still looking out the window. He could see the knots in the fence timbers. He could see clumps of frozen weeds at the base of the posts. The front lawn was dry and brittle with cold.\\n\\n Reacher said, \u0027You\u0027re not much of a gardener.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No talent,\u0027 the doctor said. \u0027No time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Does anyone garden?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not really. People are too tired. And working farmers hardly ever garden. They grow stuff to sell, not to look at.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027OK.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why do you want to know?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m asking myself, if I was a little girl with a bicycle, and I loved flowers, where would I go to see some? No point coming to a house like this, for instance. Or any house, probably. Or anywhere at all, really, because every last inch of ground is ploughed for cash crops. I can think of just three possibilities. I saw two big rocks in the fields, with brambles around them. Nice wild flowers in the early summer, probably. There may be more just like them, but it doesn\u0027t matter anyway, because in the early summer they would be completely inaccessible, because you\u0027d have to wade a mile through growing corn just to get to them. But there was one other place I saw the same kind of brambles.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where was that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Around the base of that old barn. Windblown seeds, I guess. People plough close, but they leave some space.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You think she rode there on her own?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think it\u0027s possible. Maybe she knew the one place she was sure to see flowers. And maybe someone knew she knew.\u0027\\n\\n FIFTY-ONE\\n\\n THE DUNCANS HAD MOVED ON TO JONAS\u0027S KITCHEN, BECAUSE the taped window in Jasper\u0027s was leaking cold air, and the burning fabric in the stove was making smoke and smells. They had stopped drinking bourbon and had started drinking coffee. The sun was up and the day was already forty minutes old. Jacob Duncan checked the clock on the wall and said, \u0027The sun is up in Canada too. Dawn was about ten minutes ago. I bet the shipment is already rolling. I know that boy. He likes an early start. He\u0027s a good man. He doesn\u0027t waste time. The transfer will be happening soon.\u0027\\n\\n The road that led south from Medicine Hat petered out after Pakowki Lake. The blacktop surface finished with a ragged edge, and then there was a quarter-mile of exposed roadbed, just crushed stone bound with tar, and then that finished too, in a forest clearing with no apparent exit. But the white van lined up between two pines and drove over stunted underbrush and found itself on a rutted track, once wide, now neglected, a firebreak running due south, designed with flames and westerly winds in mind. The van rolled slowly, tipping left and right, its wheels moving up and down independently, like walking. Ahead of it was nothing but trees, and then the Montana town of Hogg Parish. But the van would stop halfway there, a little more than two miles short of the border, at the northern limit of the safe zone, exactly symmetrical with its opposite number in America, which was no doubt already in place and waiting, all fresh and energetic and ready for the last leg of the journey.\\n\\n The doctor went back to the kitchen and returned with more coffee. He said, \u0027It could have been an accident. Maybe she went inside the barn.\u0027\\n\\n Reacher said, \u0027With her bicycle?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s possible. We don\u0027t know enough about her. Some kids would dump a bike on the track, and others would wheel it inside. It\u0027s a matter of personality. Then she might have injured herself on something in there. Or gotten stuck. The door is jammed now. Maybe it was baulky then. She could have gotten trapped. No one would have heard her shouting.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And then what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027An eight-year-old without food or water, she wouldn\u0027t have lasted long.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not a pleasant thought,\u0027 Reacher said.\\n\\n \u0027But preferable to some of the alternatives.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Maybe.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Or she might have gotten hit by a truck. Or a car. On the way over there. You said it yourself, the roads could have been busy. Maybe the driver panicked and hid the body. And the bike with it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Anywhere. In that barn, or miles away. In another county. Another state, even. Maybe that\u0027s why nothing was ever found.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Maybe,\u0027 Reacher said again.\\n\\n The doctor went quiet.\\n\\n Reacher said, \u0027Now there\u0027s something you\u0027re not telling me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How much?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Probably half an hour.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Before what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The other three Cornhuskers will come here for breakfast. Their buddies are here, so this is their temporary base. They\u0027ll make my wife cook for them. They enjoy feudal stuff like that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I figured,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027I\u0027ll be ready.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027One of them is the guy who broke your nose.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know.\u0027\\n\\n The doctor said nothing.\\n\\n Reacher said, \u0027Can I ask you a question?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is your garage like your garden or like your television set?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027More like my television set.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s good. So turn around and watch the road. I\u0027ll be back in ten.\u0027 Reacher picked up the Remington and found his way through the kitchen to the mud room lobby. He found the door that led to the garage. It was a big space, empty because the Subaru was still at the motel, and neat and clean, with a swept floor and no visible chaos. There were shelving racks all along one wall, loaded with the stuff that hadn\u0027t been in the basement. There was a workbench along a second wall, well organized, again neat and clean, with a vice, and a full-width pegboard above, loaded with tools logically arrayed.\\n\\n Reacher unloaded the Remington, five remaining shells from the magazine and one from the breech. He turned the gun upside down and clamped it in the vice. He found an electric jigsaw and fitted a woodcutting blade. He plugged it in and fired it up and put the dancing blade on the walnut and sawed off the shoulder stock, first with a straight cut across the narrowest point, and then again along a curving line that mirrored the front contour of the pistol grip. Two more passes put a rough chamfer on each raw edge, and then he found a rasp and cleaned the whole thing up, with twists of walnut falling away like grated chocolate, and then he finished the job with a foam pad covered with coarse abrasive. He blew off the dust and rubbed his palm along the result, and he figured it was satisfactory.\\n\\n He swapped the jigsaw blade for a metal cutter, a fine blued thing with tiny teeth, and he laid it against the barrel an inch in front of the forestock. The saw screeched and screamed and howled and the last foot of the barrel fell off and rang like a bell against the floor. He found a metal file and cleaned the burrs of steel off the new muzzle, inside and out. He released the vice and lifted the gun out and pumped it twice, crunch-crunch, crunch-crunch, and then he reloaded it, five in the magazine and one in the breech. A sawn-off with a pistol grip, not much longer than his forearm.\\n\\n He found the coat closet on his way back through the house and retrieved his winter parka. The Glock and the switchblade were still in the pockets, along with the two screwdrivers and the wrench. He used the switchblade to slit the lining inside the left-hand pocket, so the sawn-off would go all the way in. He put the coat on. Then he unlocked the front door, and went back to the dining room to wait.\\n\\n The Cornhuskers came in separately, one by one, the first of them right on time, exactly thirty minutes after the doctor had spoken, in a black pick-up truck he left on the road. He jogged up the driveway and pushed in through the door like he owned the place, and Reacher laid him out with a vicious blow to the back of the head, from behind, with the wrench. The guy dropped to his knees and toppled forward on his face. Reacher invested a little time and effort in dragging him onward across the shiny wood, and then he taped him up, quick and dirty, not a permanent job, but enough for the moment. The crunch of the wrench and the thump of the guy falling and Reacher\u0027s grunting and groaning woke the doctor\u0027s wife and Dorothy Coe. They came out of their rooms wearing bathrobes. The doctor\u0027s wife looked at the new guy on the floor and said, \u0027I guess they\u0027re coming in for breakfast.\u0027\\n\\n Reacher said, \u0027But today they\u0027re not getting any.\u0027\\n\\n Dorothy Coe asked, \u0027What about tomorrow?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tomorrow is a new day. How well do you know Eleanor Duncan?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s not to blame for anything.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027ll be hauling your harvest this year. She\u0027s going to be in charge.\u0027\\n\\n Dorothy Coe said nothing.\\n\\n The doctor\u0027s wife said, \u0027You want us to stay out of the way?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Might be safer,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027You don\u0027t want one of these guys falling on you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Another one coming,\u0027 the doctor called from the dining room, soft and urgent.\\n\\n The second guy went down exactly the same as the first, and in the same place. There was no room left to drag him forward. Reacher folded his legs at the knees so the door would close, and then he taped him up right there.\\n\\n The last to arrive was the guy who had broken Reacher\u0027s nose.\\n\\n And he didn\u0027t come alone. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-dying-for-jack-reacher-15/page-23.html","bookId":2348,"book":{"id":2348,"title":"Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher #15)","description":"Storyline: Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher #15) \\n There’s deadly trouble in the corn county of Nebraska . . . and Jack Reacher walks right into it.
