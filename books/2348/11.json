{"id":66448,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"TWENTY-SIX\n REACHER SAID, \u0027I\u0027VE GOT AT LEAST AN HOUR\u0027S DRIVE AHEAD OF ME. I could use something more comfortable than a truck. And the doctor should keep the truck, anyway. He might need it around here. For his job.\u0027\n Eleanor Duncan said, \u0027You won\u0027t get away with it. You\u0027ll be driving a stolen car straight through where the county police are based.\u0027\n \u0027They won\u0027t know it\u0027s stolen. Not if Seth doesn\u0027t tell them.\u0027\n \u0027But he will.\u0027\n \u0027Tell him not to. Tell him if he does, I\u0027ll come back here and break his arms. Tell him to keep quiet and pick it up tomorrow. I\u0027ll leave it somewhere along the way.\u0027\n \u0027He won\u0027t listen.\u0027\n \u0027He will.\u0027\n \u0027He doesn\u0027t listen to anyone.\u0027\n \u0027He listens to those two out-of-towners.\u0027\n \u0027Because he\u0027s scared of them.\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s scared of me, too. He\u0027s scared of everybody. Believe me, that\u0027s how Seth is.\u0027\n Nobody spoke. Reacher took the Cadillac key from the bowl, and gave the pick-up key to the doctor, and headed for the door.\n Seth Duncan was at his father\u0027s kitchen table, opposite the old man himself, elbow to elbow with his uncle Jonas on one side and his uncle Jasper on the other. The four men were still and subdued, because they weren\u0027t alone in the room. Roberto Cassano was there, leaning on the sink, and Angelo Mancini was there, leaning on the door. Cassano had made a point of smoothing his shirt into the waistband of his pants, even though it was already immaculate, and Mancini had opened his coat and pressed the heels of his hands into the small of his back, as if it was aching from driving, but really both men\u0027s gestures had been designed to show off their pistols in their shoulder holsters. The pistols were Colt Double Eagles. Stainless steel semi-automatics. A matched pair. The Duncans had seen the weapons and gotten the point, and so they were sitting quiet and saying nothing.\n Cassano said, \u0027Tell me again. Explain it to me. Convince me. How is this stranger disrupting the shipment?\u0027\n Jacob Duncan said, \u0027Do I tell your boss how to run his business?\u0027\n \u0027I guess not.\u0027\n \u0027Because it\u0027s his business. Presumably it has a thousand subtleties that I don\u0027t fully understand. So I stay well out of it.\u0027\n \u0027And Mr Rossi stays well out of your business. Until he gets inconvenienced.\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s welcome to find an alternative source.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m sure he will. But right now there\u0027s a live contract.\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027ll deliver.\u0027\n \u0027When?\u0027\n \u0027As soon as this stranger is out of our hair.\u0027\n Cassano just shook his head in frustration.\n Mancini said, \u0027You guys need to change your tactics. The stranger was in the fields, OK, no question, but now he\u0027s not any more. He\u0027s back in the truck he took from those two donkeys last night. He had it stashed somewhere. You should be looking for it. You should be checking the roads again.\u0027\n Seth Duncan\u0027s Cadillac was new enough to have all the bells and whistles, but old enough to be a straight-up turnpike cruiser. It wasn\u0027t competing against BMW and Mercedes Benz for yuppie money, like the current models were. It was competing against planes and trains for long-distance comfort, like traditional full-boat Caddies always had. Reacher liked it a lot. It was a fine automobile. It was long and wide and weighed about two tons. It was smooth and silent. It was relaxed. It was a one-finger, one-toe kind of car, designed for sprawling. It had black paint and black leather and black glass. And a warm-toned radio and a three-quarters-full tank of gas.\n Reacher had got in it and racked its seat back and eased it out of the garage and K-turned it behind the house and nosed it cautiously back to the two-lane. He had turned left, south, and wafted on down the road in a rolling cocoon of calm and quiet. The landscape didn\u0027t change at all. Straight road ahead, dirt to the right, dirt to the left, clouds overhead. He saw no other traffic. Ten miles south of where he started there was an old roadhouse standing alone in the weedy remnant of a beaten-earth parking lot. It was closed down and boarded up, with a bad roof and ancient Pabst Blue Ribbon and Miller High Life signs on the walls, barely visible behind layers of mud. After that there was nothing, all the way to the horizon.\n Roberto Cassano stepped out of Jacob Duncan\u0027s back door and walked across weedy gravel to where he couldn\u0027t be overheard. A thin plume of black smoke rose far to the north. The burned-out truck, still smouldering. The stranger\u0027s work.\n Cassano dialled his cell and got Rossi after three rings. He said, \u0027They\u0027re sticking to their story, boss. We\u0027re not going to get the shipment until they get the stranger.\u0027\n Rossi said, \u0027That makes no sense.\u0027\n \u0027Tell me about it. It\u0027s Alice in Wonderland.\u0027\n \u0027How much pressure have you applied?\u0027\n \u0027To the Duncans themselves? That\u0027s my next question. How much pressure do you want us to apply?\u0027\n There was a long pause, with a breath, like a sigh, resigned. Rossi said, \u0027The problem is, they sell great stuff. I won\u0027t find better. I won\u0027t find anything half as good. So I can\u0027t burn them. Because I\u0027m going to need them again, in the future. Over and over. No question about that.\u0027\n \u0027So?\u0027\n \u0027So play their game. Find the damn stranger.\u0027\n The doctor stepped out of Eleanor Duncan\u0027s door and stared hard at the pick-up truck. He didn\u0027t want to get in it. Didn\u0027t want to drive it. Didn\u0027t want to be seen with it. Didn\u0027t want to be anywhere near it. It was a Duncan vehicle. It had been misappropriated, and the manner of its misappropriation had been a major humiliation for the Duncans. Two Cornhuskers, tossed aside, contemptuously. Therefore to be involved with the truck in any way at all would be an outrageous provocation. Insane. He would be punished, severely and for ever.\n But he was a doctor.\n And sober, unfortunately.\n Therefore clear-headed.\n He had patients. He had responsibilities. To Vincent at the motel, for one. To Dorothy the housekeeper, for another. Both were shaken up. And he was a married man. His wife was eight miles away, scared and alone.\n He looked at the key in his hand and the truck on the driveway. He mapped out a route in his head. He could park behind Dorothy\u0027s house and keep the truck out of sight. He could park on the wrong side of the motel office and achieve the same result. Then he could dump the truck to the north and hike across the fields to home.\n Total exposure, maybe two miles on minor tracks, and four on the two-lane road.\n Ten minutes.\n That was all.\n Safe enough.\n Maybe.\n He climbed in the cab and started the engine.\n The anonymous white van was still on Route 3, still in Canada, but it had left British Columbia behind and had entered Alberta. It was making steady progress, heading east, completely unnoticed. Its driver was making no calls. His phone was switched off. The assumption was that cell towers close to the 49th Parallel were monitored for activity. Perhaps conversations were recorded and analysed. Homeland Security departments on both sides of the border had computer programs with sophisticated software. Individual words could trigger alerts. And even without compromising language, an electronic record of where a guy had been, and when, was always best avoided. For the same reason, all gas purchases were made with cash, in the local currency, and at every stop the driver turned his collar up and pulled his hat down low, in case there were cameras connected to digital recorders or distant control rooms.\n The van rolled on, making steady progress, heading east.\n Rossi clicked off the call with Cassano and thought hard for five minutes, and then he dialled Safir, six blocks away. He took a breath and held it and asked, \u0027Have you ever seen better merchandise?\u0027\n Safir said, \u0027You don\u0027t have to play the salesman. I already fell for your pitch.\u0027\n \u0027And you\u0027ve always been satisfied, right?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m not satisfied now.\u0027\n \u0027I understand,\u0027 Rossi said. \u0027But I want to discuss something with you.\u0027\n \u0027Equals discuss,\u0027 Safir said. \u0027We\u0027re not equals. I tell, you ask.\u0027\n \u0027OK, I want to ask you something. I want to ask you to take a step back and consider something.\u0027\n \u0027For example?\u0027\n \u0027I need this shipment, you need this shipment, everyone needs this shipment. So I want to ask you to put our differences aside and make common cause. Just for a day or two.\u0027\n \u0027How?\u0027\n \u0027My contacts in Nebraska have a bug up their ass.\u0027\n \u0027I know all about that,\u0027 Safir said. \u0027My men gave me a full report.\u0027\n \u0027I want you to send them up there to help.\u0027\n \u0027Send who? Up where?\u0027\n \u0027Your men. To Nebraska. There\u0027s no point in having them here in my office. Your interests are my interests, and I\u0027m already working as hard as I can on this. So I\u0027m thinking your guys could go help my guys and between us we could solve this problem.\u0027\n The doctor made it to Dorothy\u0027s farmhouse unobserved and parked in the yard behind it, nose to tail with Dorothy\u0027s own pick-up. He found her in her kitchen, washing dishes. Breakfast dishes, presumably. Hers and Reacher\u0027s. Which had been a crazy risk.\n He asked, \u0027How are you holding up?\u0027\n She said, \u0027I\u0027m OK. You look worse than me.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll survive.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re in a Duncan truck.\u0027\n \u0027I know.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s dumb.\u0027\n \u0027Like cooking breakfast for the guy was dumb.\u0027\n \u0027He was hungry.\u0027\n The doctor asked, \u0027You need anything?\u0027\n \u0027I need to know how this is going to end.\u0027\n \u0027Not well, probably. He\u0027s one guy, on his own. And there\u0027s no guarantee he\u0027ll even stick around.\u0027\n \u0027You know where he is right now?\u0027\n \u0027Yes. More or less.\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t tell me.\u0027\n \u0027I won\u0027t.\u0027\n Dorothy said, \u0027You should go check on Mr Vincent. He was hurt pretty bad.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s where I\u0027m headed next,\u0027 the doctor said.\n Safir clicked off the call with Rossi and thought hard for ten long minutes, and then he dialled his customer Mahmeini, eight blocks across town. He took a breath and held it and asked, \u0027Have you ever seen better merchandise?\u0027\n Mahmeini said, \u0027Get to the damn point.\u0027\n \u0027There\u0027s a kink in the chain.\u0027\n \u0027Chains don\u0027t have kinks. Hoses have kinks. Chains have weak links. Are you confessing? You\u0027re the weak link?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m just saying. There\u0027s a speed bump. A Catch-22. It\u0027s crazy, but it\u0027s there.\u0027\n \u0027And?\u0027\n \u0027We all have a common goal. We all want that shipment. And we\u0027re not going to get it until the speed bump disappears. That\u0027s a fact, unfortunately. There\u0027s nothing any of us can do about it. We\u0027re all victims here. So I\u0027m asking you to put our differences aside and make common cause, just for a day or two.\u0027\n \u0027How?\u0027\n \u0027I want you to take your guys out of my office and send them up to Nebraska. I\u0027m sending my guys. We could all work together and solve this problem.\u0027\n Mahmeini went quiet. Truth was, he was nothing more than a link in a chain, too, the same as Safir, the same as Rossi, who he knew all about, the same as the Duncans, who he knew all about too, and Vancouver. He knew the lie of the land. He had exercised due diligence. He had done the research. They were all links in a chain, except that he was the penultimate link, the second to last, and therefore he was under the greatest strain. Because right next to him at the top were Saudis, unbelievably rich and beyond vicious. A bad combination.\n Mahmeini said, \u0027Ten per cent discount.\u0027\n Safir said, \u0027Of course.\u0027\n Mahmeini said, \u0027Call me back with the arrangements.\u0027\n The doctor parked to the rear of the motel lounge, between its curved wall and a circular stockade that hid the trash cans and the propane tanks, nose to tail with Vincent\u0027s own car, which was an old Pontiac sedan. Not a perfect spot. The truck would be clearly visible from certain angles, both north and south. But it was the best he could do. He got out and paused in the chill and checked the road. Nothing coming.\n He found Vincent in the lounge, just sitting there in one of his red velvet armchairs, doing absolutely nothing at all. He had a black eye and a split lip and a swelling the size of a hen\u0027s egg on his cheek. Exactly like the doctor himself, in fact. They were a matched pair. Like looking in a mirror.\n The doctor asked, \u0027You need anything?\u0027\n Vincent said, \u0027I have a terrible headache.\u0027\n \u0027Want painkillers?\u0027\n \u0027Painkillers won\u0027t help. I want this to be over. That\u0027s what I want. I want that guy to finish what he started.\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s on his way to Virginia.\u0027\n \u0027Great.\u0027\n \u0027He said he\u0027s going to check in with the county cops along the way. He said he\u0027s going to come back if there\u0027s something wrong with the case file from twenty-five years ago.\u0027\n \u0027Ancient history. They\u0027ll have junked the file.\u0027\n \u0027He says not.\u0027\n \u0027Then they won\u0027t let him see it.\u0027\n \u0027He says they will.\u0027\n \u0027But what can he find now, that they didn\u0027t find then? Saying all that just means he\u0027s never coming back. He\u0027s softening the blow, that\u0027s all he\u0027s doing. He\u0027s slipping away, with an excuse. He\u0027s leaving us in the lurch.\u0027\n The strange round room went quiet.\n \u0027You need anything?\u0027 the doctor asked again.\n \u0027Do you?\u0027 Vincent asked back. \u0027You want a drink?\u0027\n \u0027Are you allowed to serve me?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s a little late to worry about that kind of thing, don\u0027t you think? You want one?\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 the doctor said. \u0027I better not.\u0027 Then he paused and said, \u0027Well, maybe just one, for the road.\u0027\n Safir called Rossi back and said, \u0027I want a twenty per cent discount.\u0027\n Rossi said, \u0027In exchange for what?\u0027\n \u0027Helping you. Sending my boys up there.\u0027\n \u0027Fifteen per cent. Because you\u0027ll be helping yourself too.\u0027\n \u0027Twenty,\u0027 Safir said. \u0027Because I\u0027m talking about sending more boys than just mine.\u0027\n \u0027How so?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve got guys babysitting me too. Two of them. Right here, right now. I told you that, didn\u0027t I? So you think I\u0027m taking my guys out of your office while I\u0027ve still got guys in my own office? Well, dream on. That\u0027s not going to happen any time soon, believe me. So I got my customer to agree to send his guys, too. Like a shared sacrifice. And anyway, a thing like this, we\u0027ll all want our fingers in the pie.\u0027\n Rossi paused.\n \u0027OK,\u0027 he said. \u0027That\u0027s good. That\u0027s real good. Between us we\u0027ll have six men up there. We can take care of this thing real fast. We\u0027ll be out of the woods in no time at all.\u0027\n \u0027Arrangements?\u0027\n Rossi said, \u0027The nearest civilization is sixty miles south. Where the county offices are. The only accommodation is a Courtyard Marriott. My guys are based there. I\u0027ll tell them to pull back there right now and I\u0027ll book a couple more rooms. Then everyone can meet up as soon as possible, and then they can all get going.\u0027\n The two-lane road stayed arrow-straight the whole way. Reacher kept the Cadillac rolling along at a steady sixty per, covering a mile a minute, no stress at all. Fifty minutes from where he started he passed a lonely bar on the right shoulder. It was a small hunched building made of wood, with dirty windows with beer signs in them, and three cars in its lot, and a name board that said Cell Block. Which was marginally appropriate. Reacher figured that if he squinted the place might look like a jail from an old Western movie. He blew past it and a mile later the far horizon changed. A water tower and a Texaco sign loomed up out of the afternoon gloom. Civilization. But not much of it. The place looked small. It was just a chequerboard of a dozen low-rise blocks dumped down on the dirt in the middle of nowhere.\n Eight hundred yards out there was a Chamber of Commerce billboard that listed five different ways a traveller could spend his money. If he wanted to eat, there were two restaurants. One was a diner, and one wasn\u0027t. Reacher recognized neither name. Not chains. If a traveller needed to fix his car, there was a service station and a tyre shop. If he wanted to sleep, the only choice was a Courtyard Marriott. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-dying-for-jack-reacher-15/page-11.html","bookId":2348,"book":{"id":2348,"title":"Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher #15)","description":"Storyline: \n Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher #15) \n There’s deadly trouble in the corn county of Nebraska . . . and Jack Reacher walks right into it.
