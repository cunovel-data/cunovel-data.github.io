{"id":66441,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"TEN\n THE FORD PICK-UP TRUCK WAS STILL IDLING PATIENTLY. ITS headlights were still on. The two guys lay slack and heaped in the gloom beyond the bright beams, steaming slightly, four cubic yards of bone and muscle, six hundred pounds of beef, now horizontal, not vertical. They were going to be very hard to move. The doctor\u0027s wife said, \u0027Now what the hell are we going to do?\u0027\n Reacher said, \u0027About what?\u0027\n \u0027I wish you hadn\u0027t done that.\u0027\n \u0027Why?\u0027\n \u0027Because nothing good can possibly come of it.\u0027\n \u0027Why not? What the hell is going on here? Who are these people?\u0027\n \u0027I told you. Football players.\u0027\n \u0027Not them,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027The Duncans. The people who sent them.\u0027\n \u0027Did they see me?\u0027\n \u0027These two? I doubt it.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s good. I really can\u0027t get involved in this.\u0027\n \u0027Why not? What\u0027s going on here?\u0027\n \u0027This isn\u0027t your business.\u0027\n \u0027Tell that to them.\u0027\n \u0027You seemed so angry.\u0027\n \u0027Me?\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027I wasn\u0027t angry. I was barely interested. If I had been angry, we\u0027d be cleaning up with a fire hose. As it is we\u0027re going to need a forklift truck.\u0027\n \u0027What are you going to do with them?\u0027\n \u0027Tell me about the Duncans.\u0027\n \u0027They\u0027re a family. That\u0027s all. Seth, and his father, and two uncles. They used to farm. Now they run a trucking business.\u0027\n \u0027Which one of them hires the football players?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know who makes the decisions. Maybe it\u0027s a majority thing. Or maybe they all have to agree.\u0027\n \u0027Where do they live?\u0027\n \u0027You know where Seth lives.\u0027\n \u0027What about the other three? The old guys?\u0027\n \u0027Just south of here. Three houses all alone. One each.\u0027\n \u0027I saw them. Your husband was staring at them.\u0027\n \u0027Did you see his hands?\u0027\n \u0027Why?\u0027\n \u0027He was probably crossing his fingers for luck. Whistling past the graveyard.\u0027\n \u0027Why? Who the hell are they?\u0027\n \u0027They\u0027re a hornets\u0027 nest, that\u0027s what. And you just poked it with a stick and now you\u0027re going to leave.\u0027\n \u0027What was I supposed to do? Let them hit me with shop tools?\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s what we do. We take our punishments and we keep smiles on our faces and our heads down. We go along to get along.\u0027\n \u0027What the hell are you talking about?\u0027\n She paused. Shook her head.\n \u0027It\u0027s not a big deal,\u0027 she said. \u0027Not really. So we tell ourselves. If you throw a frog in hot water, he\u0027ll jump right out again. Put him in cold water and heat it up slowly, he\u0027ll let himself get boiled to death without ever noticing.\u0027\n \u0027And that\u0027s you?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 she said. \u0027That\u0027s us.\u0027\n \u0027Give me the details.\u0027\n She paused again. She shook her head again.\n \u0027No,\u0027 she said. \u0027No, no, no. You won\u0027t hear anything bad about the Duncans from me. I want that on the record. I\u0027m a local girl, and I\u0027ve known them all my life. They\u0027re a fine family. There\u0027s nothing wrong with them. Nothing at all.\u0027\n The doctor\u0027s wife took a long hard look at the wrecked Subaru and then she set off walking home. Reacher offered her a ride in the pick-up truck, but she wouldn\u0027t hear of it. He watched her out of the motel lot until she was swallowed by the dark and lost to sight. Then he turned back to the two guys on the gravel outside his door. No way could he lift an unconscious human weighing three hundred pounds. Three hundred pounds of free weights on a bar, maybe. But not three hundred pounds of inert flesh and blood the size of a refrigerator.\n He opened the pick-up\u0027s door and climbed into the cab. It smelled of pine disinfectant and hot oil. He found the gearshift and took off forward on a curve and then stopped and backed up until the tailgate was in line with where the two guys lay. He got out again and stepped around the hood and looked at the winch that was bolted to the frame at the front. It was electric. It had a motor connected to a drum wrapped with thin steel cable. The cable had a snap hook on the end. There was a release ratchet and a winding button.\n He hit the ratchet and unwound the cable, ten feet, twenty, thirty. He flipped it up over the hood, over the roof of the cab, between two lights on the light bar, over the load bed, and down to where the guys were lying behind the truck. He dropped the tailgate flat and bent and fastened the hook on to the front of the first guy\u0027s belt. He walked back to the front of the truck and found the winding button and pressed.\n The motor started and the drum turned and the slack pulled out of the cable. Then the cable went tight and quivered like a bowstring and burred a groove into the front edge of the hood and pulled a crease into the light bar on the roof. The drum slowed, and then it dug in and kept on turning. The truck squatted low on its springs. Reacher walked back and saw the first guy getting dragged by his belt towards the load bed, scuffling along the ground, waist first, arms and legs trailing. The guy dragged all the way to the edge of the tailgate. Then the cable came up vertically and shrieked against the sheet metal and the guy\u0027s belt stretched oval and he started up into the air, spinning a little, his back arched, his head and legs and arms hanging down. Reacher waited and timed it and pulled and pushed and shoved and got him up over the angle and watched as he dragged onward into the load bed. Reacher stepped back to the front and waited a beat and then stopped the winch. He came back and leaned into the load bed and released the hook, and then he did the same things all over again for the second guy, like a veterinarian called out to a couple of dead heifers.\n Reacher drove five miles south and slowed and stopped just before the shared driveway that ran west towards the three houses huddled together. They had been painted white a generation ago and still managed a grey gleam in the moonlight. They were substantial buildings, arranged along a short arc without much space between them. There was no landscaping. Just threadbare gravel and weeds and three parked cars, and then a heavy post-and-rail fence, and then flat empty fields running away into the darkness.\n There was a light behind a ground floor window in the house on the right. No other signs of activity.\n Reacher pulled thirty feet ahead and then backed up and turned and reversed into the driveway. Gravel crunched and scrabbled under his tyres. A noisy approach. He risked fifty yards, which was about halfway. Then he stopped and slid out and unlatched the tailgate. He climbed up into the load bed and grabbed the first guy by the belt and the collar and heaved and hauled and half dragged and half rolled him to the edge and then put the sole of his boot against the guy\u0027s hip and shoved him over. The guy fell three feet and thumped down on his side and settled on his back.\n Return to sender.\n Reacher went back for the second guy and pushed and pulled and hauled and rolled him out of the truck right on top of his buddy. Then he latched the tailgate again and vaulted over the side to the ground and got behind the wheel and took off fast.\n The four Duncans were still around the table in Jasper\u0027s kitchen. Not a planned meeting, but they had a permanently long agenda and they were taking advantage of circumstances. Foremost in their minds was an emerging delay on the Canadian border. Jacob said, \u0027We\u0027re getting pressure from our friend to the south.\u0027\n Jonas said, \u0027We can\u0027t control what we can\u0027t control.\u0027\n \u0027Try telling that to him.\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027ll get his shipment.\u0027\n \u0027When?\u0027\n \u0027Whenever.\u0027\n \u0027He paid upfront.\u0027\n \u0027He always does.\u0027\n \u0027A lot of money.\u0027\n \u0027It always is.\u0027\n \u0027But this time he\u0027s agitated. He wants action. And here\u0027s the thing. It was very strange. He called me, and it was like jumping into the conversation halfway through.\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027\n \u0027He was frustrated, obviously. But also a little surly, like we weren\u0027t taking him seriously. Like he had made prior communications that had gone unheeded. Like we had ignored warnings. I felt like he was on page three and I was on page one.\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s losing his mind.\u0027\n \u0027Unless.\u0027\n \u0027Unless what?\u0027\n \u0027Unless one of us took a couple of his calls already.\u0027\n Jonas Duncan said, \u0027Well, I didn\u0027t.\u0027\n \u0027Me either,\u0027 Jasper Duncan said.\n \u0027You sure?\u0027\n \u0027Of course.\u0027\n \u0027Because there\u0027s really no other explanation here. And remember, this is a guy we can\u0027t afford to mess with. This is a deeply unpleasant person.\u0027\n Jacob\u0027s brothers both shrugged. Two men in their sixties, gnarled, battered, built like fireplugs. Jonas said, \u0027Don\u0027t look at me.\u0027\n \u0027Me either,\u0027 Jasper said again.\n Only Seth Duncan hadn\u0027t spoken. Not a word. Jacob\u0027s son.\n His father asked, \u0027What aren\u0027t you telling us, boy?\u0027\n Seth looked down at the table. Then he looked up, awkwardly, the aluminium plate huge on his face. His father and his two uncles stared right back at him. He said, \u0027It wasn\u0027t me who broke Eleanor\u0027s nose tonight.\u0027\n ELEVEN\n JASPER DUNCAN TOOK A PART-USED BOTTLE OF KNOB CREEK whiskey from his kitchen cabinet and stuck three gnarled fingers and a blunt thumb in four chipped glasses. He put them on the table and pulled the cork from the bottle and poured four generous measures. He slid the glasses across the scarred wood, a little ceremony, focused and precise. He sat down again and each man took an initial sip, and then the four glasses went back to the table, a ragged little volley of four separate thumps in the quiet of the night.\n Jacob Duncan said, \u0027From the beginning, son.\u0027\n Seth Duncan said, \u0027I\u0027m dealing with it.\u0027\n \u0027But not very well, by the sound of it.\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s my customer.\u0027\n Jacob shook his head. \u0027He was your contact, back in the day, but we\u0027re a family. We do everything together, and nothing apart. There\u0027s no such thing as a side deal.\u0027\n \u0027We were leaving money on the table.\u0027\n \u0027You don\u0027t need to go over ancient history. You found a guy willing to pay more for the same merchandise, and we surely appreciate that. But rewards bring risks. There\u0027s no such thing as something for nothing. No free lunch. So what happened?\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027re a week late.\u0027\n \u0027We aren\u0027t. We don\u0027t specify dates.\u0027\n Seth Duncan said nothing.\n Jacob said, \u0027What? You guaranteed a date?\u0027\n Seth Duncan nodded.\n Jacob said, \u0027That was dumb, son. We never specify dates. You know we can\u0027t afford to. There are a hundred factors outside of our control. The weather, for one.\u0027\n \u0027I used a worst-case analysis.\u0027\n \u0027You think too much. There\u0027s always something worse than the worst. Count on it. So what happened?\u0027\n \u0027Two guys showed up. At my house. Two days ago. His people. Tough guys.\u0027\n \u0027Where was Brett?\u0027\n \u0027I had to tell him I was expecting them.\u0027\n \u0027Were you?\u0027\n \u0027More or less.\u0027\n \u0027Why didn\u0027t you tell us?\u0027\n \u0027Because I\u0027m dealing with it.\u0027\n \u0027Not very well, son. Apparently. What did they do?\u0027\n \u0027They said they were there to deliver a message from their boss. An expression of displeasure. I said I understood. I explained. I apologized. They said that wasn\u0027t good enough. They said they had been told to leave marks. I said they couldn\u0027t. I said I have to be out and about. I have a business to run. So they hit Eleanor instead. To make their point.\u0027\n \u0027Just like that?\u0027\n \u0027They asked first. They made me agree. They made her agree, too. They made me hold her. They took turns. I told her sorry afterwards. She said, what\u0027s the difference? Them then or you later? Because she knew I was agitated.\u0027\n \u0027And then what?\u0027\n \u0027I asked for another week. They gave me forty-eight hours.\u0027\n \u0027So they came back again? Tonight?\u0027\n \u0027Yes. They did it all over again.\u0027\n \u0027So who was the guy in the restaurant? One of them?\u0027\n \u0027No, he wasn\u0027t one of them. I told you, I never saw him before.\u0027\n Jonas Duncan said, \u0027He was a passer-by. Like we figured. From what he said at the time, to the boy. A passer-by full of the wrong end of the stick on this occasion.\u0027\n Jacob said, \u0027Well, at least he\u0027s out of our hair.\u0027\n Then they heard faint sounds outside. Tyres on gravel. A vehicle, on their driveway. It came slow, whining in a low gear. It seemed to stop halfway. The engine kept on running. There was a pause, and then a ragged thump, dull, percussive, somehow mixed with the sound of breath expelled, and then another pause, and another sound. Then the vehicle drove away, faster this time, with acceleration and gear changes, and the world went quiet again.\n Jonas Duncan was first out the door. From fifty yards he could see strange humped shapes in the moonlight. From twenty he saw what they were. From five he saw what condition they were in. He said, \u0027Not out of our hair. Not exactly. Not yet.\u0027\n Jacob Duncan said, \u0027Who the hell is this guy?\u0027\n Seth Duncan and his uncle Jasper didn\u0027t speak.\n Reacher parked the pick-up truck next to the wrecked Subaru and found the motel owner waiting at his door. Mr Vincent. His hair looked black in the light.\n \u0027Changing the locks?\u0027 Reacher asked him.\n The guy said, \u0027I hope I won\u0027t have to.\u0027\n \u0027But?\u0027\n \u0027I can\u0027t let you stay here.\u0027\n Reacher said, \u0027I paid thirty dollars.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll refund it, of course.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s not the point. A deal is a deal. I didn\u0027t damage anything.\u0027\n Vincent said nothing.\n Reacher said, \u0027They already know I\u0027m here. Where else could I be?\u0027\n \u0027It was OK before.\u0027\n \u0027Before what?\u0027\n \u0027Before they told me not to let you stay here. Ignorance of the law is no offence. But I can\u0027t defy them now. Not after they informed me.\u0027\n \u0027When did they inform you?\u0027\n \u0027Two minutes ago. By phone.\u0027\n \u0027You always do what they tell you?\u0027\n Vincent didn\u0027t answer.\n \u0027Dumb question, I suppose,\u0027 Reacher said.\n \u0027I\u0027d lose everything I\u0027ve worked for. And my family before me. All those years.\u0027\n \u0027Since 1969?\u0027 Reacher asked.\n \u0027How did you know that?\u0027\n \u0027Just a lucky guess. The moon landing and all. The Apollo programme.\u0027\n \u0027Do you remember 1969?\u0027\n \u0027Vaguely.\u0027\n \u0027I loved it. So many things were going on. I don\u0027t know what happened afterwards. It really seemed like the start of a new era.\u0027\n \u0027It was,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027Just not the era you expected.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry about this.\u0027\n \u0027You going to offer to drive me down to the Interstate now?\u0027\n \u0027I can\u0027t do that either. We\u0027re not supposed to help you in any way at all.\u0027\n \u0027We?\u0027\n \u0027Any of us. They\u0027re putting the word out.\u0027\n \u0027Well, I seem to have inherited a truck,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027I can drive myself.\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t,\u0027 Vincent said. \u0027They\u0027ll report it stolen. The county police will stop you. You won\u0027t get halfway there.\u0027\n \u0027The Duncans control the cops too?\u0027\n \u0027No, not really. But a stolen truck is a stolen truck, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\n \u0027They want me to stay here?\u0027\n \u0027They do now. You started a war. They want to finish it.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-dying-for-jack-reacher-15/page-4.html","bookId":2348,"book":{"id":2348,"title":"Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher #15)","description":"Storyline: \n Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher #15) \n There’s deadly trouble in the corn county of Nebraska . . . and Jack Reacher walks right into it.
