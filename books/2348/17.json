He tracked him with the Glock and glanced beyond the wire and asked, \u0027Where are all the harvest trucks?\u0027\\n\\n The guy said, \u0027They\u0027re in Ohio. Back at the factory, for refurbishment. They\u0027re specialist vehicles, and some of them are thirty years old.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What are the two grey vans for?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027This and that. Service and repairs, tyres, things like that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are there supposed to be three?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027One is out. It\u0027s been gone a few days.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Doing what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027\\n\\n Reacher asked, \u0027When do the big trucks get back?\u0027\\n\\n The guy said, \u0027Spring.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s this place like in the early summer?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Pretty busy. The first alfalfa crop gets harvested early. There\u0027s a lot of preparation ahead of time and a lot of maintenance afterwards. This place is humming.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Five days a week?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Seven, usually. We\u0027re talking forty thousand acres here. That\u0027s a lot of output.\u0027 The guy closed the passenger door and took a step. Then he stopped dead, because Reacher had stopped dead. Reacher was staring ahead at the empty rectangle in front of the building. The cracked stones. The managerial parking lot. Nothing in it.\\n\\n Reacher asked, \u0027Where do you normally park your truck, John?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Right out front there, by the doors.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where do your buddies park?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Same place.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So where are they?\u0027\\n\\n The night-time silence clamped down and the young man\u0027s mouth came open a little, and he whirled around as if he was expecting his friends to be hiding somewhere behind him. Like a practical joke. But they weren\u0027t. He turned back and said, \u0027I guess they\u0027re out. They must have gotten a call.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027From you?\u0027 Reacher asked. \u0027When you saw Mrs Duncan?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, I swear. I didn\u0027t call. You can check my phone.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So who called them?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mr Duncan, I guess. Mr Jacob, I mean.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why would he?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. Nothing was supposed to happen tonight.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He called them but he didn\u0027t call you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, he didn\u0027t call me. I swear. Check my phone. He wouldn\u0027t call me anyway. I\u0027m on sentry duty. I was supposed to stay put.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So what\u0027s going on, John?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Best guess?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The doctor. Or his wife. Or both of them together. They\u0027re always seen as the weakest link. Because of the drinking. Maybe the Duncans think they have information.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027About what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You, of course. About where you are and what you\u0027re doing and whether you\u0027re coming back. That\u0027s what\u0027s on their minds.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It takes five guys to ask those questions?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Show of force,\u0027 the kid said. \u0027That\u0027s what we\u0027re here for. A surprise raid in the middle of the night can shake people up.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027OK, John,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027You stay here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Here?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Go to bed.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re not going to hurt me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You already hurt yourself. You showed no fight at all against a smaller, older man. You\u0027re a coward. You know that now. That\u0027s as good to me as a dislocated elbow.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Easy for you to say. You\u0027ve got a gun.\u0027\\n\\n Reacher put the Glock back in his pocket. He folded the flap down and stood with his arms out, hands empty, palms forward, fingers spread.\\n\\n He said, \u0027Now I don\u0027t. So bring it on, fat boy.\u0027\\n\\n The guy didn\u0027t move.\\n\\n \u0027Go for it,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027Show me what you\u0027ve got.\u0027\\n\\n The guy didn\u0027t move.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re a coward,\u0027 Reacher said again. \u0027You\u0027re pathetic. You\u0027re a waste of good food. You\u0027re a useless three-hundred-pound sack of shit. And you\u0027re ugly, too.\u0027\\n\\n The guy said nothing.\\n\\n \u0027Last chance,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027Step up and be a hero.\u0027\\n\\n The guy walked away, head down, shoulders slumped, towards the dark building. He stopped twenty feet later and looked back. Reacher looped around the rear of the Yukon, to the driver\u0027s door. He got in. The seat was too far back. The kid was huge. But Reacher wasn\u0027t about to adjust it in front of the guy. Some stupid male inhibition, way in the back of his brain. He just started up and turned and drove away, and fixed it on the fly.\\n\\n The Yukon drove OK, but the brakes were a little spongy. The result of the panic stop, probably, back at the old roadhouse. Five years\u0027 wear and tear, all in one split second. But Reacher didn\u0027t care. He wasn\u0027t braking much. He was hustling hard, concentrating on speeding up, not slowing down. Twenty miles was a long distance, through the empty rural darkness.\\n\\n He saw nothing the whole way. No lights, no other vehicles. No activity of any kind. He got back to the main two-lane north of the motel and five minutes later he passed the place. It was all closed up and dark. No blue neon. No activity. No cars, except the wrecked Subaru. It was still there, beaded over with dew, low down on slowly softening tyres, sad and inert, like road kill. Reacher charged onward past it, and then he made the right and the left and the right, along the boundaries of the dark empty fields, like twice before, to the plain ranch house with the post-and-rail fence and the flat, featureless yard.\\n\\n There were lights on in the house. Plenty of them. Like a cruise ship at night on the open ocean. But there was no sign of uproar. There were no cars on the driveway. No pick-up trucks, no SUVs. No large figures in the shadows. No sound, no movement. Nothing. The front door was closed. The windows were intact.\\n\\n Reacher turned in and parked on the driveway and walked to the door. He stood right in front of the spy hole and rang the bell. There was a whole minute\u0027s delay. Then the spy hole darkened and lightened and locks and chains rattled and the doctor opened up. He looked tired and battered and worried. His wife was standing behind him in the hallway, in the bright light, with the phone to her ear. The phone was the old-fashioned kind, big and black on a table, with a dial and a curly wire. The doctor\u0027s wife was not talking. She was just listening, concentrating hard, her eyes narrowing and widening.\\n\\n The doctor said, \u0027You came back.\u0027\\n\\n Reacher said, \u0027Yes, I did.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are you OK? The Cornhuskers are out and about.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We know,\u0027 the doctor said. \u0027We just heard. We\u0027re on the phone tree right now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They didn\u0027t come here?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not yet.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So where are they?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re not sure.\u0027\\n\\n Reacher said, \u0027Can I come in?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course,\u0027 the doctor said. \u0027I\u0027m sorry.\u0027 He stepped back and Reacher stepped in. The hallway was very warm. The whole house was warm, but it felt smaller than before, like a desperate little fortress. The doctor closed the door and turned two keys and put the chain back on. He asked, \u0027Did you see the police files?\u0027\\n\\n Reacher said, \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027re inconclusive,\u0027 Reacher said. He moved on into the kitchen. He heard the doctor\u0027s wife say, \u0027What?\u0027 She sounded puzzled. Maybe a little shocked. He glanced back at her. The doctor glanced back at her. She said nothing more. Just continued to listen, eyes moving, taking mental notes. The doctor followed Reacher into the kitchen.\\n\\n \u0027Want coffee?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n I\u0027m not drunk, he meant.\\n\\n Reacher said, \u0027Sure. Lots of it.\u0027\\n\\n The doctor set about filling the machine. The kitchen was even warmer than the hallway. Reacher took off his coat and hung it on the back of a chair.\\n\\n The doctor asked, \u0027What do you mean, inconclusive?\u0027\\n\\n Reacher said, \u0027I mean I could make up a story about how the Duncans did it, but there\u0027s really no proof either way.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Can you find proof? Is that why you came back?\u0027\\n\\n Reacher said, \u0027I came back because those two Italian guys who were after me seem to have joined up with a regular United Nations of other guys. Not a peacekeeping force, either. I think they\u0027re all coming here. I want to know why.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Pride,\u0027 the doctor said. \u0027You messed with the Duncans, and they won\u0027t tolerate that. Their people can\u0027t handle you, so they\u0027ve called in reinforcements.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Doesn\u0027t make sense,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027Those Italians were here before me. You know that. You heard what Eleanor Duncan said. So there\u0027s some other reason. They have some kind of a dispute with the Duncans.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then why would they help the Duncans in their own dispute with you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How many of them are coming?\u0027 the doctor asked.\\n\\n From the hallway his wife said, \u0027Five of them.\u0027 She had just gotten off the phone. She stepped into the kitchen and said, \u0027And they\u0027re not coming. They\u0027re already here. That was the message on the phone tree. The Italians are back. With three other men. Three cars in total. The Italians in their blue Chevy, plus two guys in a red Ford, and one guy in a black car that everyone swears is Seth Duncan\u0027s Cadillac.\u0027\\n\\n THIRTY-NINE\\n\\n REACHER POURED HIMSELF A CUP OF COFFEE AND THOUGHT FOR a long moment and said, \u0027I left Seth Duncan\u0027s Cadillac at the Marriott.\u0027\\n\\n The doctor\u0027s wife asked, \u0027So how did you get back here?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I took a Chevy Malibu from one of the bad guys.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That thing on the driveway?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, that\u0027s a GMC Yukon I took from a football player.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So what happened with the Cadillac?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I left a guy stranded. I stole his car, and then I guess he stole mine. Probably not deliberate tit for tat. Probably just coincidental, because there wasn\u0027t really an infinite choice down there. He didn\u0027t want some piece-of-shit pick-up truck, obviously, and he didn\u0027t want anything with big-time security built in. The Cadillac fit the bill. Probably the only thing that did. Or else he was just plain lazy, and didn\u0027t want to look around too long. The Cadillac was right there. We were all in the same hotel.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did you see the guys?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t see the Italians. But I saw the other four.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That makes six, not five. Where\u0027s the other one?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I promise you something,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027The guy who took the Cadillac put his bag on the back seat, not in the trunk.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How do you know?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because that\u0027s where the sixth guy is. In the trunk. I put him there.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Does he have air?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He doesn\u0027t need air. Not any more.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sweet Jesus. What happened?\u0027\\n\\n Reacher said, \u0027I think whatever else they\u0027re doing, they\u0027re coming here to get me first. Like a side issue of some kind. Like mission creep. I don\u0027t know why, but that\u0027s the only way I can explain it. The way I see it, they all assembled tonight in the Marriott and the Italians announced the mission and gave the others a description, probably vague and definitely secondhand, because they haven\u0027t actually laid eyes on me yet, and then I bumped into one of the others after that, in the lobby, and he was looking at me, like he was asking himself, is that the guy? Can it be? Can it? I could see him thinking. We got out to the lot and he put his hand in his pocket and I hit him. You ever heard of commotio cordis?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Chest wall trauma,\u0027 the doctor said. \u0027Causes fatal cardiac dysrhythmia.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ever seen it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Neither had I. But I\u0027m here to tell you, it works real good.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What was in his pocket?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A knife and a gun and an ID from Vegas.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Vegas?\u0027 the doctor said. \u0027Do the Duncans have gambling debts? Is that the dispute?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Possible,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027No question the Duncans have been living beyond their means for a long time. They\u0027ve been getting some extra income from somewhere.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why say that? They\u0027ve been extorting forty farms for thirty years. And a motel. That\u0027s a lot of money.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, it isn\u0027t,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027Not really. This isn\u0027t the wealthiest area in the world. They could be taking half of what everyone earns, and that wouldn\u0027t buy them a pot to piss in. But Seth lives like a king and they pay ten football players just to be here. They couldn\u0027t do all that on the back of a seasonal enterprise.\u0027\\n\\n The doctor\u0027s wife said, \u0027We should worry about that later. Right now the Cornhuskers are on the loose, and we don\u0027t know where or why. That\u0027s what\u0027s important tonight. Dorothy Coe might be coming over.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Here?\u0027 Reacher asked. \u0027Now?\u0027\\n\\n The doctor said, \u0027That\u0027s what happens sometimes. With the women, mostly. It\u0027s a support thing. Like a sisterhood. Whoever feels the most vulnerable clusters together.\u0027\\n\\n His wife said, \u0027Which is always Dorothy and me, and sometimes others too, depending on exactly what the panic is.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not a good idea,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027From a tactical point of view, I mean. It gives them one target instead of multiple targets.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s strength in numbers. It works. Sometimes those boys can act a little inhibited. They don\u0027t necessarily like witnesses around, when they\u0027re sent after women.\u0027\\n\\n They took cups of coffee and waited in the dining room, which had a view of the road. The road was dark. There was nothing moving on it. It was indistinguishable from the rest of the nighttime terrain. They sat quiet for a spell, on hard upright chairs, with the lights off to preserve their view out the window, and then the doctor said, \u0027Tell us about the files.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I saw a photograph,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027Dorothy\u0027s kid was Asian.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Vietnamese,\u0027 the doctor\u0027s wife said. \u0027Artie Coe did a tour over there. Something about it affected him, I guess. When the boat people thing started, they stepped up and adopted.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did many people from here go to Vietnam?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A fair number.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did the Duncans go?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t think so. They were in an essential occupation.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So was Arthur Coe.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Different strokes for different folks.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who was chairman of the local draft board?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Their father. Old man Duncan.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So the boys didn\u0027t keep on farming to please him. They kept on to keep their asses out of the war.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I suppose.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good to know,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027They\u0027re cowards, too, apart from anything else.\u0027\\n\\n The doctor said, \u0027Tell us about the investigation.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Long story,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027There were eleven boxes of paper.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The investigation had problems,\u0027 Reacher said.\\n\\n \u0027Like what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027One was a conceptual problem, and the others were details. The lead detective was a guy called Carson, and the ground kind of shifted under his feet over a twelve-hour period. It started out as a straightforward missing persons issue, and then it slowly changed to a potential homicide. And Carson didn\u0027t really revisit the early phase in the light of the later phase. The first night, he had people checking their own outbuildings. Which was reasonable, frankly, with a missing kid. But later he never really searched those outbuildings independently. Only one of them, basically, for an old couple who hadn\u0027t done it themselves. Everyone else self-certified, really. In effect they said no sir, the kid ain\u0027t here, and she never was, I promise. At some point Carson should have started over and treated everyone as a potential suspect. But he didn\u0027t. He focused on the Duncans only, based on information received. And the Duncans came out clean.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You think it was someone else?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Could have been anyone else in the world, just passing through. If not, it could have been any of the local residents. Probably not Dorothy or Arthur Coe themselves, but that still leaves thirty-nine possibilities.\u0027\\n\\n The doctor\u0027s wife said, \u0027I think it was the Duncans.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Three different agencies disagree with you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They might be wrong.\u0027\\n\\n Reacher nodded in the dark, his gesture unobserved.\\n\\n \u0027They might be,\u0027 he said. \u0027There might have been another conceptual error. A failure of imagination, anyway. It\u0027s clear that the Duncans never left their compound, and it\u0027s clear that the kid never showed up there. There are reliable witnesses to both of those facts. Four boys were building a fence. And the science came up negative, too. But the Duncans could have had an accomplice. A fifth man, essentially. He could have scooped up the kid and taken her somewhere else. Carson never even thought about that. He never checked known associates. And he should have, probably. You wait five years to build a fence, and you happen to be doing it on the exact same day a kid disappears? Could have been a prefabricated alibi. Carson should have wondered, at least. I would have, for sure.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who would the fifth man have been?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Anyone,\u0027 Reacher said. \u0027A friend, maybe. One of their drivers, perhaps. It\u0027s clear a vehicle was involved, otherwise why was the bike never found?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I always wondered about the bike.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did they have a friend? Did you ever see one, when you were babysitting?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I saw a few people, I guess.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Anyone close? This would have been a very intimate type of relationship. Shared enthusiasms, shared passions, absolute trust. Someone into the same kind of thing they were into.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A man?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Almost certainly. The same kind of creep.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not sure. I can\u0027t remember. Where would he have taken her?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Anywhere, theoretically. And that was another major mistake. Carson never really looked anywhere else, apart from the Duncans\u0027 compound. It was crazy not to search the transportation depot, for instance. As a matter of fact I don\u0027t think that was a real problem, because it seems like that place is real busy in the early part of the summer, seven days a week. Something to do with alfalfa, whatever that is. No one would take an abducted kid to a work site full of witnesses. But there was one other place Carson should have checked for sure. And he didn\u0027t. He ignored it completely. Possibly because of ignorance or confusion.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Which was where?\u0027\\n\\n But Reacher didn\u0027t get time to answer, because right then the window blazed bright and the room filled with moving lights and shadows. They played over the walls, the ceiling, their faces, alternately stark white and deep black.\\n\\n Headlight beams, strobing through the posts of the fence.\\n\\n A car, coming in fast from the east. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-dying-for-jack-reacher-15/page-17.html","bookId":2348,"book":{"id":2348,"title":"Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher #15)","description":"Storyline: Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher #15) \\n There’s deadly trouble in the corn county of Nebraska . . . and Jack Reacher walks right into it.
