Lost luggage is only mildly unpleasant compared to bunking with a witch who holds a grudge. And a sunburn might be embarrassing and painful, but it doesn\u0027t last as long as a curse. Of course, even in the most hellish of situations, love can thrive. . . . \n From light and funny to dark and creepy, these stories have something for everyone. You definitely won\u0027t want to leave this collection at home!\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/vacations-from-hell.jpg","author":"Libba Bray","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/vacations-from-hell.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:12 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:20 AM"}}
