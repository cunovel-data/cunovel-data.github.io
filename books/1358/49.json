{"id":26598,"no":49,"title":"Chapter 49.","content":"The two fugitives, holding each other’s hands, had fled from the fire without a word to each other. All that needed to be spoken seemed to them both to be over. They hurried on instinctively, but without any hope, expecting every moment when destruction should overtake them. Walter was the last to give up consciousness: but the sickening sense of a great fall, the whirl and resistance of the air rushing madly against him through the void, the sensation mounting up to his brain, the last stronghold of consciousness, and thrill of feeling, as if life were to end there, in a painful rush of blood, were all that were known to him. What happened really was that, holding Oona insensible in his arms, he was carried downwards with the slide and impetus of the part of the ruin on which he was standing, detached by his own weight, rather than thrown violently down by the action of the explosion. The force of the fall, however, was so great, and the mass falling with them so heavy, that some of the stones, already very unsteady, of the pavement below gave way, and carried them underground to one of the subterranean cellars, half filled up with soil, which ran under the whole area of the old castle. How long they lay there unable to move, and for some part of the time at least entirely without consciousness, Walter could never tell. When he recovered his senses he was in absolute darkness and in considerable pain. Oona had fallen across him and the shock had thus been broken. It was a moan from her which woke him to life again. But she made no reply to his first distracted question, and only gave evidence of life by a faint little cry from time to time—too faint to be called a cry—a breath of suffering, no more. The suffocating terrible sensation of the darkness, a roar of something over them like thunder, the oppression of breathing, which was caused by the want of atmosphere, all combined to bewilder his faculties and take away both strength and will to do anything more than lie there quietly and gasp out the last breath. Walter was roused by feeling in Oona an unconscious struggle for breath. She raised first one hand, then another, as if to take away something which was stifling her, and he began to perceive in the vagueness of his awakening consciousness that her life depended upon his exertions. Then, his eyes becoming more accustomed to the darkness, he caught a faint ray of light, so attenuated as to be no more than a thread in the solid gloom. To drag himself towards this, and with himself the still more precious burden, thus in utter helplessness confided to him, was a more terrible work than Walter in all his life had ever attempted before. There was not room to stand upright, and his limbs were so shaken and aching that he could scarcely raise himself upon them; and one of his arms was useless, and, when he tried to raise it, gave him the most exquisite pain. It seemed hours before he could succeed in dragging her to the little opening, a mere crevice between the stones, through which the thread of light had come. When he had cleared the vegetation from it, a piercing cold breath came in and revived him. He raised Oona in his arms to the air, but the weight of her unconsciousness was terrible to him in his weakened condition, and though she began to breathe more easily, she was not sufficiently recovered to give him any help. \\n\\n \\n\\n Thus she lay, and he crouched beside her, trying to think, for he could not tell how long. He heard sounds above him indeed, but the roar of the falling stones drowned the human noises, and his brain was too much clouded to think of the search which must be going on overhead for his companion and himself. The worst of all was this dazed condition of his brain, so that it was a long time before he could put one thing to another and get any command of his thoughts. In all likelihood consciousness did not fully return until the time when the men above in despair relinquished their work, for some feeble sense of cries and human voices penetrated the darkness, but so muffled and far off that in the dimness of his faculties he did not in any way connect them with himself, nor think of attempting any reply. Perhaps it was, though he was not aware that he heard it, the echo of his own name that finally brought him to the full possession of himself—and then all his dull faculties centred, not in the idea of any help at hand, but in that of fighting a way somehow to a possible outlet. How was he to do it? The pain of his arm was so great that at times he had nearly fainted with mere bodily suffering, and his mind fluctuated from moment to moment—or was it not rather from hour to hour?—with perplexity and vain endeavour. He was conscious, however, though he had not given any meaning to the sounds he heard, of the strange silence which followed upon the stopping of the work. Something now and then like the movements of a bird (was it Hamish working wildly above, half-mad, half-stupefied, unable to be still?) kept a little courage in him, but the silence and darkness were terrible, binding his very soul. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was then that he had the consolation of knowing that his companion had come to herself. Suddenly a hand groping found his, and caught it; it was his wounded arm, and the pain went like a knife to his heart, a pang which was terrible, but sweet. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Where are we?” Oona said, trying to raise herself—oh, anguish!—by that broken arm. \\n\\n \\n\\n He could not answer her for the moment, he was so overcome by the pain—and he was holding her up with the other arm. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Do not hold my hand,” he said at last; “take hold of my coat. Thank God that you can speak!” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Your arm is hurt, Walter?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Broken, I think; but never mind, that is nothing. Nothing matters so long as you have your senses. Oona, if we die together, it will be all right?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yes,” she said, raising her face in the darkness to be nearer his. He kissed her solemnly, and for the moment felt no more pain. \\n\\n \\n\\n “As well this way as another. Nothing can reach us here—only silence and sleep.” \\n\\n \\n\\n She began to raise herself slowly, until her head struck against the low roof. She gave a faint cry—then finding herself on her knees, put her arm round him, and they leant against each other. “God is as near in the dark as in the day,” she said. “Lord, deliver us—Lord, deliver us!” Then, after a pause, “What happened? You saved my life.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Is it saved?” he asked. “I don’t know what has happened, except that we are together.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Oona gave a sudden shudder and clung to him. “I remember now, the flames and the fire: and it was I that broke the lamp. What did it mean, the lamp? I thought it was something devilish—something to harm you.” She shivered more and more, clinging to him. “Do you think it is He—that has shut us up in this dungeon, to die?” \\n\\n \\n\\n Walter made no reply; it was no wonder to him that she should speak wildly. He too was tempted to believe that accident had no part in what had befallen them, that they had now encountered the deadly vengeance of their enemy. He tried to soothe her, holding her close to his breast. “I think we are in some of the vaults below—perhaps for our salvation.” As her courage failed there was double reason that he should maintain a good heart. “There must be some outlet. Will you stay here and wait till I try if I can find a way?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Oh no, no,” cried Oona, clinging to him, “let us stay together. I will creep after you. I will not hinder you.” She broke off with a cry, echoing, but far more keenly, the little moan that came from him unawares as he struck his arm against the wall. She felt it far more sharply than he did, and in the darkness he felt her soft hands binding round his neck something warm and soft like their own touch in which she had wound the wounded arm to support it. It was the long white “cloud” which had been about her throat, and it warmed him body and soul; but he said nothing by way of gratitude. They were beyond all expressions of feeling, partly because they had reached the limit at which reality is too overpowering for sentiment, and partly because there was no longer any separation of mine and thine between them, and they were but one soul. \\n\\n \\n\\n But to tell the miseries of their search after a way of escape would demand more space than their historian can afford. They groped along the wall, thinking now that they saw a glimmer in one direction, now in another, and constantly brought up with a new shock against the opaque resistance round them, a new corner, or perhaps only that from which they started; under their feet unequal heaps of damp soil upon which they stumbled, and broken stones over which Oona, with childlike sobs of which she was unconscious, caught her dress, falling more than once as they laboured along. In this way they moved round and round their prison, a long pilgrimage. At length, when they were almost in despair, saying nothing to each other, only keeping close that the touch of each to each might be a moral support, they found themselves in what seemed a narrow passage, walls on each side, and something like an arrowslit over their heads, the light from which showed them where they were, and was as an angel of consolation to the two wounded and suffering creatures, stumbling along with new hope. But when they had reached the end of this narrow passage, Walter, going first, fell for a distance of two or three feet into the lower level of another underground chamber like that which he had left, jarring his already strained and racked frame, and only by an immense effort hindered Oona from falling after him. The force of the shock, and instant recovery by which he kept her back and helped her to descend with precaution, brought heavy drops of exhaustion and pain to his forehead. And when they discovered that they were nothing the better for their struggles, and that the place which they had reached at such a cost, though lighter, was without any outlet whatever except that by which they had come, their discouragement was so great that Walter had hard ado not to join in the tears which Oona, altogether prostrated by the disappointment, shed on his shoulder. \\n\\n \\n\\n “We must not give in,” he tried to say. “Here there is a little light at least. Oona, my darling, do not break down, or I shall break down too.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “No, no,” she said submissively through her sobs, leaning all her weight upon him. He led her as well as he was able to a heap of earth in the corner, over which in the roof was a little opening to the light, barred with an iron stanchion, and quite out of reach. Here he placed her tenderly, sitting down by her, glad of the rest, though it was so uninviting. The light came in pale and showed the strait inclosure of their little prison. They were neither of them able to resume their search, but sat close together leaning against each other, throbbing with pain, and sick with weariness and disappointment. It gave Walter a kind of forlorn pride in his misery to feel that while Oona had failed altogether, he was able to sustain and uphold her. They did not speak in their weakness, but after a while dozed and slept, in that supreme necessity of flesh and blood which overcomes even despair, and makes no account of danger. They slept as men will sleep at death’s door, in the midst of enemies: and in the depths of their suffering and misery found refreshment. But in that light sleep little moans unawares came with their breathing, for both were bruised and shaken, and Walter’s broken arm was on fire with fever and pain. It was those breathings of unconscious suffering that caught the ear of the minister as he made his prayer. His step had not disturbed them, but when he came back accompanied by the others, the light was suddenly darkened and the stillness broken by some one who flung himself upon his knees with a heavy shock of sound and a voice pealing in through the opening—“Miss Oona, if ye are there, speak! or, oh for the love of the Almighty, whoever is there, speak and tell me where’s my leddy?” It was Hamish, half mad with hope and suspense and distracted affection, who thus plunged between them and the light. \\n\\n \\n\\n They both woke with the sound, but faintly divining what it was, alarmed at first rather than comforted by the darkness into which they were plunged. There was a pause before either felt capable of reply, that additional deprivation being of more immediate terror to them, than there was consolation in the half-heard voice. In this pause, Hamish, maddened by the disappointment of his hopes, scrambled to his feet reckless and miserable, and shook his clenched fist in the face of the minister who was behind him. \\n\\n \\n\\n “How dare ye,” he cried, “play upon a man, that is half wild, with your imaginations! there’s naebody there!” and with something between a growl and an oath, he flung away, with a heavy step that sounded like thunder to the prisoners. But next moment the rage of poor Hamish all melted away into the exceeding and intense sweetness of that relief which is higher ecstasy than any actual enjoyment given to men, the very sweetness of heaven itself—for as he turned away the sound of a voice, low and weak, but yet a voice, came out of the bowels of the earth; a murmur of two voices that seemed to consult with each other, and then a cry of “Oona is safe. Oona is here. Come and help us, for the love of God.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “The Lord bless you!” cried the old minister, falling on his knees. “Oona, speak to me, if you are there. Oona, speak to me! I want to hear your own voice.” \\n\\n \\n\\n There was again a pause of terrible suspense. Hamish threw himself down, too, behind the minister, tears running over his rough cheeks, while the young man, who was overawed by the sight, and affected too, in a lesser degree, stood with his face half hidden against the wall. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I am here,” Oona said feebly, “all safe—not hurt even. We are both safe; but oh, make haste, make haste, and take us out of this place.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “God bless you, my bairn. God bless you, my dearest bairn!” cried Mr. Cameron: but his words were drowned in a roar of laughter and weeping from the faithful soul behind him—“Ay, that will we, Miss Oona—that will we, Miss Oona!” Hamish shouted and laughed and sobbed till the walls rang, then clamorous with his heavy feet rushed out of sight without another word, they knew not where. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I’ll follow him,” said young Patrick; “he will know some way.” \\n\\n \\n\\n The minister was left alone at the opening through which hope had come. He was crying like a child, and ready to laugh too like Hamish. \\n\\n \\n\\n “My bonny dear,” he said; “my bonny dear——” and could not command his voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Mr. Cameron—my mother. She must be breaking her heart.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “And mine,” Walter said with a groan. He thought even then of the bitterness of her woe, and of all the miserable recollections that must have risen in her mind: please God not to come again. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I am an old fool,” said Mr. Cameron, outside: “I cannot stand out against the joy; but I am going. I’m going, my dear. Say again you are not hurt, Oona. Say it’s you, my darling, my best bairn!” \\n\\n \\n\\n “And me that had not the courage to say a word to yon poor woman,” he said to himself as he hurried away. The light was still grey in the skies, no sign of the sun as yet, but not only the hills distinct around, but the dark woods, and the islands on the water, and even the sleeping roofs so still among their trees on the shores of the loch, had come into sight. The remaining portion of the house which had stood so many assaults, and the shapeless mass of the destroyed tower, stood up darkly against the growing light: and almost like a part of it, like a statue that had come down from its pedestal was the figure of Mrs. Methven, which he saw standing between him and the shore, her face turned towards him. She had heard the hurrying steps and the shout of Hamish, and knew that something had happened. She had risen against her will, against the resolution she had formed, unable to control herself, and stood with one hand under her cloak, holding her heart, to repress, if possible, the terrible throbbing in it. The face she turned towards the minister overawed him in the simplicity of his joy. It was grey, like the morning, or rather ashen white, the colour of death. Even now she would not, perhaps could not, ask anything; but only stood and questioned him with her eyes, grown to twice their usual size, in the great hollows which this night had opened out. \\n\\n \\n\\n The minister knew that he should speak carefully, and make easy to her the revolution from despair to joy; but he could not. They were both beyond all secondary impulses. He put the fact into the plainest words. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Thank God! your son is safe,” he cried. \\n\\n \\n\\n “What did you say?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Oh, my poor lady, God be with you. I dared not speak to you before. Your son is safe. Do you know what I mean? He is as safe as you or me.” \\n\\n \\n\\n She kept looking at him, unable to take it into her mind; that is to say, her mind had flashed upon it, seized it at the first word, yet—with a dumb horror holding hope away from her, lest deeper despair might follow—would not allow her to believe. \\n\\n \\n\\n “What—did you say? You are trying to make me think——” And then she broke off, and cried out “Walter!” as if she saw him—as a mother might cry who saw her son suddenly, unlooked for, come into the house when all believed him dead—and fell on her knees,—then from that attitude sank down upon herself, and dropped prostrate on the ground. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Cameron was alarmed beyond measure. He knew nothing of faints, and he thought the shock had killed her. But what could he do? It was against his nature to leave a stranger helpless. He took off his coat and covered her, and then hurried to the door and called up Macalister’s wife, who was dozing in a chair. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I think I have killed her,” he said, “with my news.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Then ye have found him?” the three old people said together, the woman clasping her hands with a wild “Oh hon—oh hon!” while Symington came forward, trembling, and pale as death. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I had hoped,” he said, with quivering lips, “like the apostles with One that was greater, that it was he that was to have delivered——Oh, but we are vain creatures! and now it’s a’ to begin again.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Is that all ye think of your poor young master? He is living, and will do well. Go and take up the poor lady. She is dead, or fainted, but it is with joy.” \\n\\n \\n\\n And then he went up-stairs. Many an intimation of sorrow and trouble the minister had carried. But good news had not been a weight upon him hitherto. He went to the other poor mother with trouble in his heart. If the one who had been so brave was killed by it, how encounter her whose soft nature had fallen prostrate at once? He met Mysie at the door, who told him her mistress had slept, but showed signs of waking. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Oh, sir, if ye could give her something that would make her sleep again! I could find it in my heart to give her, what would save my poor lady from ever waking more,” cried the faithful servant; “for oh, what will she do—oh, what will we all do without Miss Oona?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Mysie,” cried the minister, “how am I to break it to her? I have just killed the poor lady down-stairs with joy; and what am I to say to your mistress? Miss Oona is safe and well—she’s safe and well.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Oh, Mr. Cameron,” cried Mysie, with a sob, “I ken what you are meaning. She’s well, the Lord bless her, because she has won to heaven.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Forrester had woke during this brief talk, and raised herself upon the sofa. She broke in upon them in a tone so like her ordinary voice, so cheerful and calm, that they both turned round upon her with a kind of consternation. \\n\\n \\n\\n “What is that you are saying—safe and well—oh, safe and well. Thank God for it; but I never had a moment’s doubt. And where has she been all this weary night; and why did she leave me in this trouble? What are ye crying for, Mysie, like a daft woman? You may be sure, my darling has been doing good, and not harm.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “That is true, my dear lady—that is true, my dear friend,” cried the minister. “God bless her! She has done us all good, all the days of her sweet life.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “And you are crying too,” said Oona’s mother, almost with indignation. “What were you feared for? Do you think I could not trust God, that has always been merciful to me and mine? or was it Oona ye could not trust?” she said with smiling scorn. “And is she coming soon? For it seems to me we have been here a weary time.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “As soon—as she can get out of the—place where she is. The openings are blocked up by the ruin.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I had no doubt,” said Mrs. Forrester, “it was something of that kind.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Then she rose up from the sofa, very weak and tottering, but smiling still, her pale and faded face looking ten years older, her hair all ruffled, falling out of its usual neat arrangement. She put up her hands to her head with a little cry. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Bless me,” she said, “she will think I have gone out of my senses, and you too, Mysie, to take my bonnet off and expose me, with no cap. I must put all this right again before my Oona comes.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Cameron left her engaged in these operations, with the deepest astonishment. Was it a faith above the reach of souls less simple? or was it the easy rebound of a shallow nature? He watched her for a moment as she put up her thin braids of light hair, and tied her ribbons, talking all the time of Oona. \\n\\n \\n\\n “She never was a night out of her bed in all her life before; and my only fear is she may have gotten a chill, and no means here of making her comfortable. Mysie, you will go down-stairs, and try at least to get the kettle to boil, and a cup of tea for her. Did the minister say when she would be here?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “No, mem,” said Mysie’s faltering voice; “naething but that she was safe and well; and the Lord forgive me—I thought—I thought——” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Never mind what you thought,” said Mrs. Forrester briskly, “but run down-stairs and see if you can make my darling a good cup of tea.” \\n\\n \\n\\n By the time she had tied her bonnet strings and made herself presentable, the full light of the morning was shining upon the roused world. The air blew chill in her face as she came down the staircase (strangely weak and tottering, which was “just extraordinary” she said to herself), and emerged upon the little platform outside. Several boats already lay on the beach, and there was the sound of the voices and footsteps of men breaking the stillness. Mrs. Forrester came out with those little graces which were part of herself, giving a smile to old Symington, and nodding kindly to the young men from the yacht who were just coming ashore. “This is early hours,” she said to them with her smile, and went forward to the little group before the door, surrounding Mrs. Methven, who still lay where Mr. Cameron had left her, incapable of movement. “Dear me,” said Mrs. Forrester, “here have I been taking up a comfortable room, and them that have a better right left out of doors. They have given us a terrible night, my child and yours, but let us hope there has been a good reason for it, and that they will be none the worse. They are just coming, the minister tells me. If ye will take the help of my arm, we might step that way and meet them. They will be glad to see we are not just killed with anxiety, which is what my Oona will fear.” \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1473/44215.html","bookId":1358,"book":{"id":1358,"title":"The Wizard\u0027s Son","description":"简介： The Methvens occupied a little house in the outskirts of a little town where there was not very much going on of any description, and still less which they could take any share in, being, as they were, poor and unable to make any effective response t...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201601/18/08-46-36-64-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1473","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:54 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:54 AM"}}
