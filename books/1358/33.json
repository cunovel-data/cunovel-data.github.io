{"id":26582,"no":33,"title":"Chapter 33.","content":"Was this then the conclusion of all things—that there was nothing so perfect that it was worth a man’s while to struggle for it; that any officious interference with the recognised and existing was a mistake; that nothing was either the best or the worst, but all things mere degrees in a round of the comparative, in which a little more or a little less was of no importance, and the most strenuous efforts tended to failure as much as indifference? Walter, returning to the old house which was his field of battle, questioned himself thus, with a sense of despair not lessened by the deeper self-ridicule within him, which asked, was he then so anxious for the best, so ready to sacrifice his comfort for an ideal excellence? That he, of all men, should have this to do, and yet that, being done, it should be altogether ineffectual, was a sort of climax of clumsy mortal failure and hopelessness. The only good thing he had done was the restoration of those half-evicted cotters, and that was but a mingled and uncertain good, it appeared. What was the use of any struggle? If it was his own personal freedom alone that he really wanted, why here it was within his power to purchase it—or at least a moderate amount of it—a comparative freedom, as everything was comparative. His mind by this time had ceased to be able to think, or even to perceive with any distinctness the phrase or motif inscribed upon one of those confused and idly-turning wheels of mental machinery which had stood in the place of thought to him. It was the afternoon when he got back, and everything within him had fallen into an afternoon dreariness. He lingered when he landed on the waste bit of grass that lay between the little landing-place and the door of the old castle. He had no heart to go in and sit down unoccupied in that room which had witnessed so many strange meetings. He was no longer indeed afraid of his visitor there, but rather looked forward with a kind of relief to the tangible presence which delivered him from meetings of the mind more subtle and painful. But he had no expectation of any visitor; nor was there anything for him to do except to sit down and perhaps attempt to read, which meant solely a delivering over of himself to his spiritual antagonists—for how was it possible to give his mind to any fable of literature in the midst of a parable so urgent and all-occupying, of his own? \\n\\n \\n\\n He stood therefore idly upon the neglected turf, watching the ripple of the water as it lapped against the rough stones on the edge. The breadth of the loch was entirely hidden from him by the projection of the old tower, which descended into the water at the right, and almost shut off this highest corner of Loch Houran into a little lakelet of its own. Walter heard the sound of oars and voices from the loch without seeing any one: but that was usual enough, and few people invaded his privacy: so that he was taken by surprise when, suddenly raising his eyes, he was aware of the polished and gilded galley from Birkenbraes, in which already Mr. Williamson, seated in the stern, had perceived and was hailing him. “Hallo, my Lord Erradeen! Here we’ve all come to see ye this fine afternoon. I told them we should find ye under your own vine and your own fig-tree.” This speech was accompanied by a general laugh. The arrival of such a party, heralded by such laughter in a desolate house, with few servants and no readiness for any such emergency, to a young man in Walter’s confused and distracted condition would not, it may be supposed, have been very welcome in any case, and at present in his exhaustion and dismay he stood and gazed at them with a sort of horror. There was not even a ready servitor like Hamish to assist in the disembarkation. Duncan had rowed cheerfully off upon some other errand after landing his master, and old Symington and old Macalister were singularly ill-adapted for the service. Lord Erradeen did his best, with a somewhat bad grace, to receive the boat at the landing-place. The gravity of his countenance was a little chill upon the merry party, but the Williamsons were not of a kind that is easily discouraged. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Oh, yes, here we all are,” said the millionnaire. “I would not let our English visitor, Mr. Braithwaite here, leave without showing him the finest thing on the loch. So I just told him I knew I might take the liberty. Hoot! we know ye have not your household here, and that it is just an old family ruin, and not bound to produce tea and scones like the Forresters’ isle. Bless me! I hope we have a soul above tea and scones,” Mr. Williamson cried with his hearty laugh. \\n\\n \\n\\n By this time the young, hardy, half-clad rowers had scrambled out, and grouped themselves in various attitudes, such as would suit a new and light-hearted Michael Angelo—one kneeling on the stones holding the bow of the boat, another with one foot on sea and one on shore helping the ladies out. Walter in his dark dress, and still darker preoccupied countenance, among all those bronzed and cheerful youths looked like a being from another sphere: but the contrast was not much to his advantage either in bodily or mental atmosphere. He looked so grave and so unlike the joyous hospitality of a young housekeeper surprised by a sudden arrival, that Katie, always more on her guard than her father, looked at him with a countenance as grave as his own. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I am not the leader of this expedition, Lord Erradeen,” she said; “you must not blame me for the invasion. My father took it into his head, and when that happens there is nothing to be done. I don’t mean I was not glad to be brought here against my will,” she added, as his face, by a strain of politeness which was far from easy to him, began to brighten a little. Katie was not apt to follow the leading of another face and adopt the woman’s role of submission, but she felt herself so completely in the wrong, an intruder where she was very sure she and her party, exuberant in spirits and gaiety, were not wanted, that she was compelled to watch his expression and make her apologies with a deference quite unusual to her. “I hope it will not be a very great—interruption to you,” she said after a momentary pause. \\n\\n \\n\\n “That could never matter,” Walter said, with some stateliness. “I could have wished to have notice and to have received my friends at Auchnasheen rather than here. But being here—you must excuse the primitive conditions of the place.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Hoot! there is nothing to excuse—a fine old castle, older than the flood—just the very thing that is wanted for the picturesque, ye see, Braithwaite; for as ye were remarking, we are in general too modern for a Highland loch. But you’ll not call this modern,” said Mr. Williamson. “Will that old body not open the door to ye when he sees ye have friends? Lord! that just beats all! That is a step beyond Caleb Balderstone.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Papa!” cried Katie in keen reproof, “we have been quite importunate enough already. I vote we all go over to Auchnasheen—the view there is much finer, and we could send over for Oona——” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Is it common in this country,” said the member of Parliament, “to have two residences so very near? It must be like going next door for change of air when you leave one for the other, Lord Erradeen.” \\n\\n \\n\\n At this there was that slight stir among the party which takes place when an awkward suggestion is made; the young men and the girls began to talk hurriedly, raising up a sort of atmosphere of voices around the central group. This however was curiously and suddenly penetrated by the reply which—who?—was it Walter? made, almost as it seemed without a pause. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Not common—but yet not unknown in a country which has known a great deal of fighting in its day. The old castle is our family resource in danger. We do our family business here, our quarrels: and afterwards retire to Auchnasheen, the house of peace (perhaps you don’t know that names have meanings hereabouts?) to rest.” \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a pause as slight, as imperceptible to the ignorant, as evident to the instructed as had been the stir at the first sound of those clear tones. Walter himself to more than one observer had seemed as much startled as any of them. He turned quickly round towards the speaker with a sudden blanching of his face which had been pale enough before; but this was only momentary; afterwards all that was remarkable in him was a strange look of resolution and determined self-control. Perhaps the only one completely unmoved was the Englishman, who at once accepted the challenge, and stepped forward to the individual who it was evident to him was the only duly qualified cicerone in the party, with eager satisfaction. \\n\\n \\n\\n “That is highly interesting. Of course the place must be full of traditions,” he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n “With your permission, Walter, I will take the part of cicerone,” said the new voice. To some of the party it seemed only a voice. The ladies and the young men stumbled against each other in their eager curiosity about the stranger. “I will swear there was nobody near Erradeen when we landed,” said young Tom Campbell in the nearest ear that presented itself; but of course it was the number of people about which caused this, and it could be no shadow with whom the M.P. went forth delighted, asking a hundred questions. “You are a member of the family?” Mr. Braithwaite said. He was not tall, and his companion was of a splendid presence. The Englishman had to look up as he spoke and to quicken his somewhat short steps as he walked to keep up with the other’s large and dignified pace. Katie followed with Walter. There was a look of agitation and alarm in her face; her heart beat she could not tell why. She was breathless as if she had been running a race. She looked up into Lord Erradeen’s face tremulously, not like herself. “Is this gentleman—staying with you?” she said in a scarcely audible voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n Walter was not agitated for his part, but he had little inclination to speak. He said “Yes” and no more. \\n\\n \\n\\n “And we have been—sorry for you because you were alone? Is it a—relation? is it—? You have never,” said Katie, forcing the words out with a difficulty which astonished her, and for which she could not account, “brought him to Birkenbraes.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Walter could not but smile. A sort of feeble amusement flew over his mind touching the surface into a kind of ripple. “Shall I ask him to come?” he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n Katie was following in the very footsteps of this altogether new and unexpected figure. There was nothing like him, it seemed to her, in all the country-side. His voice dominated every other sound, not loud, but clear. It subdued her little being altogether. She would not lose a word, yet her breath was taken away by an inexplicable terror. \\n\\n \\n\\n “He is—like somebody,” she said, panting, “out of a book,” and could say no more. \\n\\n \\n\\n Old Macalister came towards them from the now open door, at which stood Symington in attendance. The servants had been disturbed by the unusual sounds of the arrival. Macalister’s old face was drawn and haggard. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Where will ye be taking all thae folk?” he said, no doubt forgetting his manners in his bewilderment. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Come back, ye’ll get into mischief that road,” he cried, putting out his hand to catch the arm of Braithwaite, who, guided by the stranger, was passing the ordinary entrance. He became quite nervous and angry when no heed was paid to him. “My lord, you’re no so well acquaint yourself. Will you let that lad just wander and break his neck?” he cried, with a kind of passion. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Never mind,” said Walter, with a strange calm which was as unaccountable as all the rest. “Will you tell your wife to prepare for these ladies—when we come back.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Here Symington too came forth to explain somewhat loudly, addressing his master and Braithwaite alternately, that the roads were not safe about the old castle, that the walls were crumbling, that a person not acquaint might get a deadly fall, with unspeakable anxiety in his eyes. The party all followed, notwithstanding, led by the stranger, whom even the least of them now thought she could distinguish over Katie’s head, but of whom the servants took no notice, addressing the others in front as if he had not been there. \\n\\n \\n\\n “My lord, ye’ll repent if ye’ll no listen to us,” Symington said, laying his hand in sudden desperation on Walter’s arm. \\n\\n \\n\\n “You fool!” cried the young man, “can’t you see we have got a safe guide?” \\n\\n \\n\\n Symington gave a look round him wildly of the utmost terror. His scared eyes seemed to retreat into deep caverns of anguish and fear. He stood back out of the way of the somewhat excited party, who laughed, and yet scarcely could laugh with comfort, at him. The youngsters had begun to chatter: they were not afraid of anything—Still—: though it was certainly amusing to see that old man’s face. \\n\\n \\n\\n Turning round to exchange a look with Macalister, Symington came in contact with Mr. Williamson’s solid and cheerful bulk, who brought up the rear. “I’m saying,” said the millionnaire confidentially, “who’s this fine fellow your master’s got with him? A grand figure of a man! It’s not often you see it, but I always admire it. A relation, too; what relation? I would say it must be on the mother’s side, for I’ve never seen or heard tell of him. Eh? who’s staying with your master, I’m asking ye? Are ye deaf or doited that ye cannot answer a simple question?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Na, there is nothing the matter with me; but I think the rest of the world has just taken leave of their senses,” Symington said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1473/44199.html","bookId":1358,"book":{"id":1358,"title":"The Wizard\u0027s Son","description":"简介： The Methvens occupied a little house in the outskirts of a little town where there was not very much going on of any description, and still less which they could take any share in, being, as they were, poor and unable to make any effective response t...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201601/18/08-46-36-64-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1473","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:54 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:54 AM"}}
