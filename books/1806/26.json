Even Trieux citizens would not be so stupid as to murder me with Trieux weapons. It would start another wave of persecution and suspicion. Our government would crack down even harder on them,” Friedrich said, propping his military boots up on a footstool.\\n\\n “I don’t believe you are taking this seriously enough,” Merrich said.\\n\\n “Why would you say that?”\\n\\n “Because if they weren’t Trieux rebels, and no one from Erlauf would hurt a hair on your head, that means we have another enemy out there,” Merrich said.\\n\\n “The assailants were paid a private contract?” Friedrich frowned, skimming the papers.\\n\\n “Yes. They met with a handful of contacts in various countries before receiving you as their elimination assignment. It’s all very cloak-and-dagger. What’s most disconcerting is that they were officially hired and dispatched by a dark mage.”\\n\\n “A mage?”\\n\\n “One exiled by the Veneno Conclave, yes. Worst yet, she was only a representative. She didn’t write the contract out of personal spite.”\\n\\n “Whom did she represent?”\\n\\n Merrich shrugged. “They didn’t know. All they said was that she hired them on behalf of an organization or movement of some sort.”\\n\\n Friedrich grimly leaned back in his chair. “I don’t like it,” he said. “A month ago our southern border was plagued with wraiths. Last week, a company from the Fifth Regiment took out a giant, and now we hear my assassins were hired by a mage?”\\n\\n “That’s too much activity from dark magic to be a coincidence,” Merrich said. “We used to get a handful of evil based entity fights per year. Now they happen almost weekly.”\\n\\n “And yet the parts of Erlauf that used to belong to Trieux remain unscathed,” Friedrich said.\\n\\n “You think Trieux is somehow involved?”\\n\\n “No. I think whoever or whatever is doing this is lulling them into a false sense of security. Our troubles are not widely publicized, after all.”\\n\\n “What do we do?”\\n\\n Friedrich tapped his fingers on his desk. “I will speak to the Commander. Before we take any serious action, it would be wise to speak to representatives from the Veneno Conclave. We don’t want to step on their toes, after all.”\\n\\n Merrich nodded. “I will tell Hardbutt.”\\n\\n Friedrich rolled his eyes. “One day General Harbach will catch you on that, and he will string you up by your tongue.”\\n\\n Merrich laughed. “Thank you for your concern, but you had best worry about your own neck first. Which reminds me, I saw Diederick earlier today.”\\n\\n “Oh?”\\n\\n “He said to tell you if you got yourself killed by assassins he would refuse to allocate funds for a gravestone or coffin.”\\n\\n Friedrich winced. “Sometimes I wonder how he obtained his high position with his terrible personality.”\\n\\n Merrich slapped his leg and stood. “He’s good at what he does. But enough of our dreary discussion. Work calls, and I intend to go out tonight. Will you come with? Friedrich?” Merrich asked when his friend didn’t respond.\\n\\n “Sorry, just thinking,” Friedrich said.\\n\\n “Of what?”\\n\\n Friedrich hesitated. “I had decided to take additional precautions regarding Cinderella’s safety, but I don’t think it’s enough. I might need to place more soldiers on guard duty around her as well.”\\n\\n “That would be wise. You can bet whatever is behind this flux of darkness will aim for her now that you have made your infatuation with her infallibly clear.”\\n\\n “I don’t think she will warm to the idea of strange men following her around.”\\n\\n Merrich shrugged. “So introduce her to them. I’m off. Read the report before you talk to the Commander, please,” Merrich said before disappearing through the door.\\n\\n Friedrich barely noticed his friend’s exit. “Introduce her? Why not? It’s earlier than I wanted them to know of her, but her safety…” Friedrich trailed off. “I’ll do it,” he decided. “It will take some planning, but I will bring Cinderella to the First Regiment.”\\n\\n Chapter 6\\n\\n “This isn’t the way to the library,” Cinderella said as she followed the Colonel down a side street in Werra.\\n\\n “I know.”\\n\\n “You said we were going to the library.”\\n\\n “I did.”\\n\\n “You said you had an easier way to get into the library.”\\n\\n “I lied.”\\n\\n Cinderella stopped walking and folded her arms across her chest.\\n\\n When the Colonel realized she wasn’t following him anymore, he stopped and retreated to her side. “It was the only way to get you to leave the stand. I want to introduce you to some of my friends.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cinderella-and-the-colonel-timeless-fairy-tales-3/page-26.html","bookId":1806,"book":{"id":1806,"title":"Cinderella and the Colonel (Timeless Fairy Tales #3)","description":"Storyline: Scratching out a living in a land recovering from war and a hostile takeover, Cinderella—an orphaned, destitute duchess—is desperate to save her lands and servants in spite of the terrible taxes placed upon her by the Erlauf queen, even if it means she must don servants’ clothes and work like a commoner. \\n Her sacrifices aren’t enough, and when a mountain of debt is levied against her, she is given one season to produce the funds.
