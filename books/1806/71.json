They will do their best to offer forgiveness on their side, as well,” Cinderella said.\n She knew Julien was already on her side; Marie and her husband would be easy to sway—there was something to be said about being a merchant who was more interested in profits than bad blood among nobles. Perhaps the Girards could be convinced, and if they were, the Delattre’s would not be far behind. Also, Cinderella had a strange inkling that the half-deaf Lord Leroy might agree with her without any sort of persuasion at all.\n “Would the lady care for a dance?” Prince Cristoph asked, shattering Cinderella’s thoughts. “We can still converse as we dance. Your conversation intrigues me.”\n “Very well,” Cinderella said.\n Prince Cristoph bowed before he approached the orchestra and spoke to them. They abruptly ended the slow song they played, and switched to a different tune.\n “Have you ever danced an Erlauf circle?” Prince Cristoph asked.\n “Yes,” Cinderella said, slow to commit. It was a dance that required absolutely no touching, although the dancers were still organized into couples. They moved around each other in a circular pattern, sliding close but never touching.\n Cinderella’s Father once told her the dance was meant to mimic the movements of the Erlauf Calvary with the horses sliding forward and backward in matched patterns.\n “So what does this forgiveness look like?” Prince Cristoph asked after he found a spot on the dance floor and lined up across from Cinderella.\n “Like love,” Cinderella said.\n Prince Cristoph almost missed the musical cue to step around Cinderella. “What does that mean?”\n “It means Trieux nobles and shopkeepers hire people from Erlauf who immigrated to Werra. It means Erlauf soldiers are gentle with people from Trieux and do not treat them with suspicion,” Cinderella said as she and the prince side-stepped each other. “Erlauf citizens can share their knowledge of flower farming, and the Trieux vendors in the market could teach Erlauf folk how to barter.”\n “This forgiveness of yours does not sound like the standard forgive and forget arrangement,” Prince Cristoph said as he bowed to Cinderella and she curtsied in tune with the music.\n “Forgetting is not at all what forgiveness means. Forgiveness, in the case of our country, is forging ahead together. People from Trieux should intertwine with people from Erlauf. The Erlauf Royal Family should acknowledge they are in what once was Trieux. If they are seen eating a Trieux dish, or using a Trieux word to describe something, I can guarantee Trieux citizens will ponder what goods and crops they can sell that people from Erlauf would like,” Cinderella said, her shoulder almost brushing the prince’s.\n “In other words, we should make an effort to adopt Trieux customs and culture into our lives?” Prince Cristoph asked.\n “In a way, yes. Right now our countries are saturated with bitterness. If we try being a little less selfish, I think the bitterness can be purged,” Cinderella said, ducking under Prince Cristoph’s arm.\n “I see. And you are willing to make some of the sacrifices you mentioned?” Prince Cristoph asked, stepping back with Cinderella before they came together again.\n “Of course, or I wouldn’t have the nerve to make these suggestions,” Cinderella said.\n “I fear there is too much bad blood between Trieux Nobles and Erlauf Nobles for friendship,” Prince Cristoph said.\n Cinderella twirled, her skirts swishing around her. “Perhaps. But there is something you must understand. The hearts of the Trieux commoners are ripe for the taking. For the most part, the upper class did a poor job caring for them. There were some exceptions, but I do not think any of the common class has strong feelings for Trieux nobility. If you can win over the entire commoner class, the remaining nobles and what few Trieux government officials are still alive will have no choice but to follow.”\n “I see,” Prince Cristoph said, clapping twice, in synch with the male dancers.\n “Additionally, you underestimate the next generation of Trieux nobles,” Cinderella said, side-stepping Prince Cristoph again. “Several of the houses have young lords and ladies who are poised to take over their parents’ titles. They do not have the same grudges and stubbornness of their parents. You might be able to win them over, if you strike soon,” Cinderella said.\n “Your thoughts intrigue me,” Prince Cristoph said as the dance came to an end.\n “But you do not support them?”\n “I never said that. I am merely withholding judgment. It is warm in here; shall we continue the conversation outside?”\n “As you wish, your Highness,” Cinderella said. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cinderella-and-the-colonel-timeless-fairy-tales-3/page-71.html","bookId":1806,"book":{"id":1806,"title":"Cinderella and the Colonel (Timeless Fairy Tales #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Scratching out a living in a land recovering from war and a hostile takeover, Cinderella—an orphaned, destitute duchess—is desperate to save her lands and servants in spite of the terrible taxes placed upon her by the Erlauf queen, even if it means she must don servants’ clothes and work like a commoner. \n Her sacrifices aren’t enough, and when a mountain of debt is levied against her, she is given one season to produce the funds.
