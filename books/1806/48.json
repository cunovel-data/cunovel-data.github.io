And I am trying hard not to feel resentful for being replaced.”\\n\\n Cinderella laughed. “He could not replace you. Not ever. You will always be my closest, dearest friend, Marie.”\\n\\n Marie arrogantly tilted her head up as she looked to Friedrich.\\n\\n “Alright, I admit defeat,” Friedrich said before picking Cinderella up and sliding her on his horse. A moment later he was mounted up behind her. “I will never dare to try and come between you two beautiful ladies.”\\n\\n “Enjoy your ride,” Marie said.\\n\\n “We will,” Friedrich said before nudging his horse forward.\\n\\n “Did Gustav tell you everything?” Cinderella asked.\\n\\n “Yes,” Friedrich said, his eyes glued to the bustling streets.\\n\\n “I’m more hardened than ever towards your queen.”\\n\\n “She seems horrible because you’re only hearing one side of the orders.”\\n\\n “Do not try to reconcile her to me,” Cinderella said, her voice sharp.\\n\\n Friedrich sighed. “I know she has been unusually hard on you.”\\n\\n “Hard? Hard? She has done her best to make me her legal slave,” Cinderella hissed.\\n\\n Friedrich was quiet until they left Werra. They lingered within eyesight of his regiment’s camp, but dismounted and walked through a hay field.\\n\\n “You have a right to hate Queen Freja, and to hate the royal family,” Friedrich said.\\n\\n “Naturally.”\\n\\n “But is it the right thing?”\\n\\n Cinderella tilted her head. “What do you mean?”\\n\\n “You’ve gotten over your hate for Erlauf soldiers and commoners, right?”\\n\\n “Yes,” Cinderella said with great hesitation.\\n\\n “Why?”\\n\\n “Because I have grown to realize and accept they are people too. I’ve known all along about Erlauf citizens, but it was difficult to reconcile the thought with soldiers—who killed my neighbors and associates,” Cinderella said.\\n\\n “And you also admit Trieux was in the wrong?”\\n\\n “Yes,” Cinderella said, her mouth forming an unhappy slant. “Where are you going with this?”\\n\\n “Why can’t you extend the same sort of forgiveness to the queen?”\\n\\n “You can’t be serious,” Cinderella said.\\n\\n “I am.”\\n\\n “Very well. Then perhaps it is because Erlauf commoners do not trek all over Aveyron, eyeing it greedily. Erlauf soldiers do not lie and steal from me, nor do they blackmail me and press me with such hard fines I will lose everything but my own body and my title. I can forgive them because their actions are forgivable. This queen of yours? She will not rest until I am destitute. For such cruelty, I have no forgiveness.”\\n\\n “Does a person have to act sorry in order to be forgiven?” Friedrich asked. “I know you have encountered cruelty from others, and yet you forgive them.”\\n\\n “Why does my attitude towards your queen bother you so?” Cinderella asked, placing her fists on her hips. “Whatever I think about Queen Freja isn’t of great importance. I am not going to rise up against her in rebellion—surely you must realize that. So what does it matter?”\\n\\n “Forgiveness takes a great deal of personal strength. A weak person cannot forgive, and their actions will keep them captive and fester like an infected wound,” Friedrich said.\\n\\n Cinderella stared at Friedrich. “What?”\\n\\n “Of everyone in this rotten country, you, Cinderella, are the nearest to grasping forgiveness. You are so close to bridging the gap between us. Hate cannot drive out hate. As long as those from Trieux hate those from Erlauf, our countries will be in an eternal struggle. If you can forgive us, you will set not only yourself free, but your countrymen as well. I want you to have the courage to forgive. I want you to be the person to save our countries.”\\n\\n “Friedrich, I am not capable of saving anyone. I can’t even save my own servants. I’m about to lose my lands. I don’t know what hope you see in me, but I am not capable of it,” Cinderella said.\\n\\n “You are much stronger than you know,” Friedrich said, stepping closer. “You can conquer a country with forgiveness,” he said, lowering his head towards Cinderella.\\n\\n When he was a hand away, Cinderella covered her mouth with her hands. “Do not even dream of it,” she said, her voice muffled.\\n\\n Friedrich sighed. “Still not yet?”\\n\\n “It will be not ever, I suspect.”\\n\\n “Why not?”\\n\\n “I said it before. Above all, I will honor my marriage.”\\n\\n “Even though we aren’t married yet?”\\n\\n Cinderella removed her hands from her mouth so she could smack Friedrich on the chest.\\n\\n “If only you could apply this same sort of loyalty towards Erlauf,” Friedrich grumbled as Cinderella minced away from him.\\n\\n “If only your queen had a heart,” Cinderella said. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cinderella-and-the-colonel-timeless-fairy-tales-3/page-48.html","bookId":1806,"book":{"id":1806,"title":"Cinderella and the Colonel (Timeless Fairy Tales #3)","description":"Storyline: Scratching out a living in a land recovering from war and a hostile takeover, Cinderella—an orphaned, destitute duchess—is desperate to save her lands and servants in spite of the terrible taxes placed upon her by the Erlauf queen, even if it means she must don servants’ clothes and work like a commoner. \\n Her sacrifices aren’t enough, and when a mountain of debt is levied against her, she is given one season to produce the funds.
