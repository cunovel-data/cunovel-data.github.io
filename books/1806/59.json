I want this arrow out whole,” one of the soldiers said to the other before yanking the arrow out of the mage.\\n\\n The mage howled and dripped black blood on the street as the soldier nodded in satisfaction.\\n\\n “Perfect,” the soldier said, wiping the arrow clean before sliding it the quiver hanging from his back.\\n\\n By this time, the people on the streets started to move again. Several of them rushed to help the wounded woman. They crouched by her side, bunching around her like a flock of birds.\\n\\n “Ivo, I have never been so glad to see you,” Cinderella said as the gruff soldier steadied her.\\n\\n “Thank you, Your Grace,” Ivo said before turning to his squad mates. “We need to get that animal into custody and take Lady Lacreux to the regiment camp immediately.”\\n\\n “I’ll signal another squad,” the soldier with the quiver said as he retrieved his bow from the street. He moved up the road, blowing a silver whistle attached to his uniform.\\n\\n “Bring a physician, too,” the soldier restraining the mage said.\\n\\n “And get back fast,” Ivo called after him. “I want this scum out of Her Ladyship’s presence.”\\n\\n “Do you need a hand?” an Erlauf man said. His voice was deep, and he was about as wide as an ox. He held the pitchfork Cinderella used to try and stab the mage, but he held it with ease and dexterity as he eyed the mage.\\n\\n Ivo nodded in the direction of the woman. “How is she?”\\n\\n The man planted the pitchfork and leaned on it. It creaked in distress under his weight as he said, “Alive. Her throat looks burned, but she’s breathin’ fine.”\\n\\n Ivo nodded.\\n\\n Cinderella blinked to clear her vision. “Good. I thought I was too late.”\\n\\n “It was smart, to get the height advantage,” the soldier holding the mage said.\\n\\n “Thank you,” Cinderella weakly smiled.\\n\\n “I do not think the Colonel will approve of your engaging the enemy,” Ivo said.\\n\\n Cinderella pointed her head skyward. “I agree. But Friedrich rarely approves of my actions the way it is.”\\n\\n “You helped her, lady?” the ox man said, squinting at Cinderella.\\n\\n “Yes,” Cinderella said. “Ivo, I believe I can stand on my own, thank you.”\\n\\n “Why?” the ox man asked.\\n\\n “Why what?”\\n\\n “Why did you help her?”\\n\\n Cinderella frowned. “Why wouldn’t I?”\\n\\n “To save yourself.”\\n\\n “Well, yes, but I couldn’t just leave her to die,” Cinderella said, gingerly touching the back of her head. “What?” she said when the ox man stared at her.\\n\\n “You’re from Trieux.”\\n\\n “Yes.”\\n\\n The ox man shook his head. He opened his mouth, but before he could further inquire, Ivo interrupted him. “I hear the whistle. Tobias is on his way back,” Ivo said, stepping to help the other soldier, who was anchoring the squirming, bleeding mage in place.\\n\\n “You’ve lost, mage. Save your strength,” the other soldier said, shaking the mage like a terrier shaking a rat.\\n\\n “You and every pest like you that approaches the lady will be crushed,” Ivo growled.\\n\\n The mage laughed, a horrible noise raspy and wet with blood. “I have lost,” he said with a whispering hiss. “But we will not fail. Trieux and Erlauf will be torn asunder. And then they will fester and rot, smothered by their own bitterness and hatred. You all will die,”\\n\\n “What,” Cinderella said, “are you talking about?”\\n\\n “Do not engage in conversation with him, Your Grace,” Ivo said.\\n\\n “Erlauf and Trieux will remain divided, and darkness thrives in division. We will come for you, and this will be our homeland—a land of all things vile and powerful.”\\n\\n “Division, you say?” Cinderella asked, taking a step closer.\\n\\n “Your Grace,” Ivo pleaded.\\n\\n Cinderella ignored him. Her gray eyes raged like hurricanes, hypnotic and furious. “You are lying.”\\n\\n The mage laughed. “Look to your people! Look to those of Erlauf. You think I am the first to try and kill you? The others didn’t even have magic. Trieux hates Erlauf, and Erlauf hates Trieux. It plays out in your very life. Do you really think that will ever change? War has filled your hearts with hatred. Hatred takes root, and never fails to destroy those who nurture it in their hearts. You are doomed,” the mage broke off.\\n\\n Cinderella stood tall. The strength of her presence made the mage shift in place. “No,” she said. “If you think I will allow your kind in my country, in Erlauf, you are sorely mistaken.”\\n\\n “You can do nothing,” the mage protested.\\n\\n “Really,” Cinderella said, her accent more noble and royal than usual. “Is that why you were trying to kill me?”\\n\\n The mage fell silent.\\n\\n “There’s Tobias,” Ivo said, nodding down the street. “ Good. He has an entire squad with him.”\\n\\n Cinderella turned to look.\\n\\n The mage snarled and jumped from the soldier holding him captive, lunging for Cinderella.\\n\\n Ivo shouted, and the mage screamed. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cinderella-and-the-colonel-timeless-fairy-tales-3/page-59.html","bookId":1806,"book":{"id":1806,"title":"Cinderella and the Colonel (Timeless Fairy Tales #3)","description":"Storyline: Scratching out a living in a land recovering from war and a hostile takeover, Cinderella—an orphaned, destitute duchess—is desperate to save her lands and servants in spite of the terrible taxes placed upon her by the Erlauf queen, even if it means she must don servants’ clothes and work like a commoner. \\n Her sacrifices aren’t enough, and when a mountain of debt is levied against her, she is given one season to produce the funds.
