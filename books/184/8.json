And all the people came together like one man into the wide place in front of the water-doorway; and they made a request to Ezra the scribe that he would put before them the book of the law of Moses which the Lord had given to Israel. \\n\\n 8:2 [hgb] 七 月 初 一 日 ， 祭 司 以 斯 拉 将 律 法 书 ， 带 到 听 了 能 明 白 的 男 女 会 众 面 前 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month. \\n\\n [bbe] And Ezra the priest put the law before the meeting of the people, before the men and women and all those who were able to take it in, on the first day of the seventh month. \\n\\n 8:3 [hgb] 在 水 门 前 的 宽 阔 处 ， 从 清 早 到 晌 午 ， 在 众 男 女 ， 一 切 听 了 能 明 白 的 人 面 前 读 这 律 法 书 。 众 民 侧 耳 而 听 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he read therein before the street that was before the water gate from the morning until midday, before the men and the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law. \\n\\n [bbe] He was reading it in the wide place in front of the water-doorway, from early morning till the middle of the day, in the hearing of all those men and women whose minds were able to take it in; and the ears of all the people were open to the book of the law. \\n\\n 8:4 [hgb] 文 士 以 斯 拉 站 在 为 这 事 特 备 的 木 台 上 。 玛 他 提 雅 ， 示 玛 ， 亚 奈 雅 ， 乌 利 亚 ， 希 勒 家 ， 和 玛 西 雅 站 在 他 的 右 边 。 毗 大 雅 ， 米 沙 利 ， 玛 基 雅 ， 哈 顺 ， 哈 拔 大 拿 ， 撒 迦 利 亚 ， 和 米 书 兰 站 在 他 的 左 边 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam. \\n\\n [bbe] And Ezra the scribe took his place on a tower of wood which they had made for the purpose; and by his side were placed Mattithiah and Shema and Anaiah and Uriah and Hilkiah and Maaseiah on the right; and on the left, Pedaiah and Mishael and Malchijah and Hashum and Hashbaddanah, Zechariah and Meshullam. \\n\\n 8:5 [hgb] 以 斯 拉 站 在 众 民 以 上 ， 在 众 民 眼 前 展 开 这 书 。 他 一 展 开 ， 众 民 就 都 站 起 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up: \\n\\n [bbe] And Ezra took the book, opening it before the eyes of all the people (for he was higher than the people); and when it was open, all the people got to their feet: \\n\\n 8:6 [hgb] 以 斯 拉 称 颂 耶 和 华 至 大 的 神 。 众 民 都 举 手 应 声 说 ， 阿 们 ， 阿 们 ， 就 低 头 ， 面 伏 于 地 ， 敬 拜 耶 和 华 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped the LORD with their faces to the ground. \\n\\n [bbe] And Ezra gave praise to the Lord, the great God. And all the people in answer said, So be it, so be it; lifting up their hands; and with bent heads they gave worship to the Lord, going down on their faces to the earth. \\n\\n 8:7 [hgb] 耶 书 亚 ， 巴 尼 ， 示 利 比 ， 雅 悯 ， 亚 谷 ， 沙 比 太 ， 荷 第 雅 ， 玛 西 雅 ， 基 利 他 ， 亚 撒 利 雅 ， 约 撒 拔 ， 哈 难 ， 毗 莱 雅 ， 和 利 未 人 使 百 姓 明 白 律 法 。 百 姓 都 站 在 自 己 的 地 方 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people stood in their place. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jeshua and Bani and Sherebiah and Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites made the law clear to the people: and the people kept in their places. \\n\\n 8:8 [hgb] 他 们 清 清 楚 楚 地 念 神 的 律 法 书 ， 讲 明 意 思 ， 使 百 姓 明 白 所 念 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading. \\n\\n [bbe] And they gave out the words of the book the law of God, clearly, and gave the sense of it, so that their minds were able to take it in. \\n\\n 8:9 [hgb] 省 长 尼 希 米 和 作 祭 司 的 文 士 以 斯 拉 ， 并 教 训 百 姓 的 利 未 人 ， 对 众 民 说 ， 今 日 是 耶 和 华 你 们 神 的 圣 日 ， 不 要 悲 哀 哭 泣 。 这 是 因 为 众 民 听 见 律 法 书 上 的 话 都 哭 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law. \\n\\n [bbe] And Nehemiah, who was the Tirshatha, and Ezra, the priest and scribe, and the Levites who were the teachers of the people, said to all the people, This day is holy to the Lord your God; let there be no sorrow or weeping; for all the people were weeping on hearing the words of the law. \\n\\n 8:10 [hgb] 又 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 去 吃 肥 美 的 ， 喝 甘 甜 的 ， 有 不 能 预 备 的 ， 就 分 给 他 。 因 为 今 日 是 我 们 主 的 圣 日 。 你 们 不 要 忧 愁 ， 因 靠 耶 和 华 而 得 的 喜 乐 是 你 们 的 力 量 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our LORD: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the LORD is your strength. \\n\\n [bbe] Then he said to them, Go away now, and take the fat for your food and the sweet for your drink, and send some to him for whom nothing is made ready: for this day is holy to our Lord: and let there be no grief in your hearts; for the joy of the Lord is your strong place. \\n\\n 8:11 [hgb] 于 是 利 未 人 使 众 民 静 默 ， 说 ， 今 日 是 圣 日 。 不 要 作 声 ， 也 不 要 忧 愁 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved. \\n\\n [bbe] So the Levites made all the people quiet, saying, Be quiet, for the day is holy; and do not give way to grief. \\n\\n 8:12 [hgb] 众 民 都 去 吃 喝 ， 也 分 给 人 ， 大 大 快 乐 ， 因 为 他 们 明 白 所 教 训 他 们 的 话 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them. \\n\\n [bbe] And all the people went away to take food and drink, and to send food to others, and to be glad, because the words which were said to them had been made clear. \\n\\n 8:13 [hgb] 次 日 ， 众 民 的 族 长 ， 祭 司 ， 和 利 未 人 都 聚 集 到 文 士 以 斯 拉 那 里 ， 要 留 心 听 律 法 上 的 话 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law. \\n\\n [bbe] And on the second day the heads of families of all the people and the priests and the Levites came together to Ezra the scribe, to give attention to the words of the law. \\n\\n 8:14 [hgb] 他 们 见 律 法 上 写 着 ， 耶 和 华 借 摩 西 吩 咐 以 色 列 人 要 在 七 月 节 住 棚 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month: \\n\\n [bbe] And they saw that it was recorded in the law that the Lord had given orders by Moses, that the children of Israel were to have tents for their living-places in the feast of the seventh month: \\n\\n 8:15 [hgb] 并 要 在 各 城 和 耶 路 撒 冷 宣 传 报 告 说 ， 你 们 当 上 山 ， 将 橄 榄 树 ， 野 橄 榄 树 ， 番 石 榴 树 ， 棕 树 ， 和 各 样 茂 密 树 的 枝 子 取 来 ， 照 着 所 写 的 搭 棚 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written. \\n\\n [bbe] And that they were to give out an order, and make it public in all their towns and in Jerusalem, saying, Go out to the mountain and get olive branches and branches of field olives and of myrtle, and palm branches and branches of thick trees, to make tents, as it says in the book. \\n\\n 8:16 [hgb] 于 是 百 姓 出 去 ， 取 了 树 枝 来 ， 各 人 在 自 己 的 房 顶 上 ， 或 院 内 ， 或 神 殿 的 院 内 ， 或 水 门 的 宽 阔 处 ， 或 以 法 莲 门 的 宽 阔 处 搭 棚 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim. \\n\\n [bbe] And the people went out and got them and made themselves tents, every one on the roof of his house, and in the open spaces and in the open squares of the house of God, and in the wide place of the water-doorway, and the wide place of the doorway of Ephraim. \\n\\n 8:17 [hgb] 从 掳 到 之 地 归 回 的 全 会 众 就 搭 棚 ， 住 在 棚 里 。 从 嫩 的 儿 子 约 书 亚 的 时 候 直 到 这 日 ， 以 色 列 人 没 有 这 样 行 。 于 是 众 人 大 大 喜 乐 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness. \\n\\n [bbe] All the people who had been prisoners and had come back, made tents and were living in them: for from the time of Jeshua, the son of Nun, till that day, the children of Israel had not done so. And there was very great joy. \\n\\n 8:18 [hgb] 从 头 一 天 ， 直 到 末 一 天 ， 以 斯 拉 每 日 念 神 的 律 法 书 。 众 人 守 节 七 日 ， 第 八 日 照 例 有 严 肃 会 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the manner. \\n\\n [bbe] And day by day, from the first day till the last, he was reading from the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast for seven days: and on the eighth day there was a holy meeting, as it is ordered in the law. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/112/1598.html","bookId":184,"book":{"id":184,"title":"尼希米记Nehemiah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 哈 迦 利 亚 的 儿 子 尼 希 米 的 言 语 如 下 。 亚 达 薛 西 王 二 十 年 基 斯 流 月 ， 我 在 书 珊 城 的 宫 中 。 [kjv] The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah.
