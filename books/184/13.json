{"id":5753,"no":13,"title":"Chapter 13","content":"13:1 [hgb] 当 日 ， 人 念 摩 西 的 律 法 书 给 百 姓 听 ， 遇 见 书 上 写 着 说 ， 亚 扪 人 和 摩 押 人 永 不 可 入 神 的 会 。 [kjv] On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever; [bbe] On that day there was a reading from the book of Moses in the hearing of the people; and they saw that it said in the book that no Ammonite or Moabite might ever come into the meeting of God; 13:2 [hgb] 因 为 他 们 没 有 拿 食 物 ， 和 水 来 迎 接 以 色 列 人 ， 且 雇 了 巴 兰 咒 诅 他 们 ， 但 我 们 的 神 使 那 咒 诅 变 为 祝 福 。 [kjv] Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing. [bbe] Because they did not give the children of Israel bread and water when they came to them, but got Balaam to put a curse on them: though the curse was turned into a blessing by our God. 13:3 [hgb] 以 色 列 民 听 见 这 律 法 ， 就 与 一 切 闲 杂 人 绝 交 。 [kjv] Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude. [bbe] So after hearing the law, they took out of Israel all the mixed people. 13:4 [hgb] 先 是 蒙 派 管 理 我 们 神 殿 中 库 房 ， 的 祭 司 以 利 亚 实 与 多 比 雅 结 亲 。 [kjv] And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, was allied unto Tobiah: [bbe] Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who had been placed over the rooms of the house of our God, being a friend of Tobiah, 13:5 [hgb] 便 为 他 预 备 一 间 大 屋 子 ， 就 是 从 前 收 存 素 祭 ， 乳 香 ， 器 皿 ， 和 照 命 令 供 给 利 未 人 ， 歌 唱 的 ， 守 门 的 五 谷 ， 新 酒 ， 和 油 的 十 分 之 一 ， 并 归 祭 司 举 祭 的 屋 子 。 [kjv] And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests. [bbe] Had made ready for him a great room, where at one time they kept the meal offerings, the perfume, and the vessels and the tenths of the grain and wine and oil which were given by order to the Levites and the music-makers and the door-keepers, and the lifted offerings for the priests. 13:6 [hgb] 那 时 我 不 在 耶 路 撒 冷 。 因 为 巴 比 伦 王 亚 达 薛 西 三 十 二 年 ， 我 回 到 王 那 里 。 过 了 多 日 ， 我 向 王 告 假 。 [kjv] But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king: [bbe] But all this time I was not at Jerusalem: for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, king of Babylon, I went to the king; and after some days, I got the king to let me go, 13:7 [hgb] 我 来 到 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 就 知 道 以 利 亚 实 为 多 比 雅 在 神 殿 的 院 内 ， 预 备 屋 子 的 那 件 恶 事 。 [kjv] And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God. [bbe] And I came to Jerusalem; and it was clear to me what evil Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in making ready for him a room in the buildings of the house of God. 13:8 [hgb] 我 甚 恼 怒 ， 就 把 多 比 雅 的 一 切 家 具 从 屋 里 都 抛 出 去 。 [kjv] And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber. [bbe] And it was evil in my eyes: so I had all Tobiah\u0027s things put out of the room. 13:9 [hgb] 吩 咐 人 洁 净 这 屋 子 ， 遂 将 神 殿 的 器 皿 和 素 祭 ， 乳 香 又 搬 进 去 。 [kjv] Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the frankincense. [bbe] Then I gave orders, and they made the rooms clean: and I put back in them the vessels of the house of God, with the meal offerings and the perfume. 13:10 [hgb] 我 见 利 未 人 所 当 得 的 分 ， 无 人 供 给 他 们 ， 甚 至 供 职 的 利 未 人 与 歌 唱 的 ， 俱 各 奔 回 自 己 的 田 地 去 了 。 [kjv] And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field. [bbe] And I saw that the Levites had not been given what was needed for their support; so that the Levites and the music-makers, who did the work, had gone away, everyone to his field. 13:11 [hgb] 我 就 斥 责 官 长 说 ， 为 何 离 弃 神 的 殿 呢 ？ 我 便 招 聚 利 未 人 ， 使 他 们 照 旧 供 职 。 [kjv] Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place. [bbe] Then I made protests to the chiefs, and said, Why has the house of God been given up? And I got them together and put them in their places. 13:12 [hgb] 犹 大 众 人 就 把 五 谷 ， 新 酒 ， 和 油 的 十 分 之 一 送 入 库 房 。 [kjv] Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries. [bbe] Then all Judah came with the tenth part of the grain and wine and oil and put it into the store-houses. 13:13 [hgb] 我 派 祭 司 示 利 米 雅 ， 文 士 撒 督 ， 和 利 未 人 毗 大 雅 作 库 官 管 理 库 房 。 副 官 是 哈 难 。 哈 难 是 撒 刻 的 儿 子 。 撒 刻 是 玛 他 尼 的 儿 子 。 这 些 人 都 是 忠 信 的 ， 他 们 的 职 分 是 将 所 供 给 的 分 给 他 们 的 弟 兄 。 [kjv] And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office was to distribute unto their brethren. [bbe] And I made controllers over the store-houses, Shelemiah the priest and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and with them was Hanan, the son of Zaccur the son of Mattaniah: they were taken to be true men and their business was the distribution of these things to their brothers. 13:14 [hgb] 我 的 神 阿 ， 求 你 因 这 事 记 念 我 ， 不 要 涂 抹 我 为 神 的 殿 ， 与 其 中 的 礼 节 所 行 的 善 。 [kjv] Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof. [bbe] Keep me in mind, O my God, in connection with this, and do not let the good which I have done for the house of my God and its worship go from your memory completely. 13:15 [hgb] 那 些 日 子 ， 我 在 犹 大 见 有 人 在 安 息 日 榨 酒 （ 原 文 作 踹 酒 榨 ） ， 搬 运 禾 捆 驮 在 驴 上 。 又 把 酒 ， 葡 萄 ， 无 花 果 ， 和 各 样 的 担 子 在 安 息 日 担 入 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 我 就 在 他 们 卖 食 物 的 那 日 警 戒 他 们 。 [kjv] In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals. [bbe] In those days, I saw in Judah some who were crushing grapes on the Sabbath, and getting in grain and putting it on asses; as well as wine and grapes and figs and all sorts of goods which they took into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day: and I gave witness against them on the day when they were marketing food. 13:16 [hgb] 又 有 推 罗 人 住 在 耶 路 撒 冷 。 他 们 把 鱼 和 各 样 货 物 运 进 来 ， 在 安 息 日 卖 给 犹 大 人 。 [kjv] There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. [bbe] And there were men of Tyre there, who came with fish and all sorts of goods, trading with the children of Judah and in Jerusalem on the Sabbath. 13:17 [hgb] 我 就 斥 责 犹 大 的 贵 胄 说 ， 你 们 怎 么 行 这 恶 事 犯 了 安 息 日 呢 ？ [kjv] Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day? [bbe] Then I made protests to the chiefs of Judah, and said to them, What is this evil which you are doing, not keeping the Sabbath day holy? 13:18 [hgb] 从 前 你 们 列 祖 岂 不 是 这 样 行 ， 以 致 我 们 神 使 一 切 灾 祸 临 到 我 们 ， 和 这 城 吗 ？ 现 在 你 们 还 犯 安 息 日 ， 使 忿 怒 越 发 临 到 以 色 列 。 [kjv] Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath. [bbe] Did not your fathers do the same, and did not our God send all this evil on us and on this town? but you are causing more wrath to come on Israel by not keeping the Sabbath holy. 13:19 [hgb] 在 安 息 日 的 前 一 日 ， 耶 路 撒 冷 城 门 有 黑 影 的 时 候 ， 我 就 吩 咐 人 将 门 关 锁 ， 不 过 安 息 日 不 准 开 放 。 我 又 派 我 几 个 仆 人 管 理 城 门 ， 免 得 有 人 在 安 息 日 担 什 么 担 子 进 城 。 [kjv] And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day. [bbe] And so, when the streets of Jerusalem were getting dark before the Sabbath, I gave orders for the doors to be shut and not to be open again till after the Sabbath: and I put some of my servants by the door so that nothing might be taken in on the Sabbath day. 13:20 [hgb] 于 是 商 人 和 贩 卖 各 样 货 物 的 ， 一 两 次 住 宿 在 耶 路 撒 冷 城 外 。 [kjv] So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice. [bbe] So the traders in all sorts of goods took their night\u0027s rest outside Jerusalem once or twice. 13:21 [hgb] 我 就 警 戒 他 们 说 ， 你 们 为 何 在 城 外 住 宿 呢 ？ 若 再 这 样 ， 我 必 下 手 拿 办 你 们 。 从 此 以 后 ， 他 们 在 安 息 日 不 再 来 了 。 [kjv] Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath. [bbe] Then I gave witness against them and said, Why are you waiting all night by the wall? if you do so again I will have you taken prisoners. From that time they did not come again on the Sabbath. 13:22 [hgb] 我 吩 咐 利 未 人 洁 净 自 己 ， 来 守 城 门 ， 使 安 息 日 为 圣 。 我 的 神 阿 ， 求 你 因 这 事 记 念 我 ， 照 你 的 大 慈 爱 怜 恤 我 。 [kjv] And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy. [bbe] And I gave the Levites orders to make themselves clean and come and keep the doors and make the Sabbath holy. Keep this in mind to my credit, O my God, and have mercy on me, for great is your mercy. 13:23 [hgb] 那 些 日 子 ， 我 也 见 犹 大 人 娶 了 亚 实 突 ， 亚 扪 ， 摩 押 的 女 子 为 妻 。 [kjv] In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab: [bbe] And in those days I saw the Jews who were married to women of Ashdod and Ammon and Moab: 13:24 [hgb] 他 们 的 儿 女 说 话 ， 一 半 是 亚 实 突 的 话 ， 不 会 说 犹 大 的 话 ， 所 说 的 是 照 着 各 族 的 方 言 。 [kjv] And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews\u0027 language, but according to the language of each people. [bbe] And their children were talking half in the language of Ashdod; they had no knowledge of the Jews\u0027 language, but made use of the language of the two peoples. 13:25 [hgb] 我 就 斥 责 他 们 ， 咒 诅 他 们 ， 打 了 他 们 几 个 人 ， 拔 下 他 们 的 头 发 ， 叫 他 们 指 着 神 起 誓 ， 必 不 将 自 己 的 女 儿 嫁 给 外 邦 人 的 儿 子 ， 也 不 为 自 己 和 儿 子 娶 他 们 的 女 儿 。 [kjv] And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves. [bbe] And I took up the cause against them, cursing them and giving blows to some of them and pulling out their hair; and I made them take an oath by God, saying, You are not to give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves. 13:26 [hgb] 我 又 说 ， 以 色 列 王 所 罗 门 不 是 在 这 样 的 事 上 犯 罪 吗 ？ 在 多 国 中 并 没 有 一 王 像 他 ， 且 蒙 他 神 所 爱 ， 神 立 他 作 以 色 列 全 国 的 王 。 然 而 连 他 也 被 外 邦 女 子 引 诱 犯 罪 。 [kjv] Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin. [bbe] Was it not in these things that Solomon, king of Israel, did wrong? among a number of nations there was no king like him, and he was dear to his God, and God made him king over all Israel: but even he was made to do evil by strange women. 13:27 [hgb] 如 此 ， 我 岂 听 你 们 行 这 大 恶 ， 娶 外 邦 女 子 干 犯 我 们 的 神 呢 ？ [kjv] Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives? [bbe] Are we then without protest to let you do all this great evil, sinning against our God by taking strange women for your wives? 13:28 [hgb] 大 祭 司 以 利 亚 实 的 孙 子 ， 耶 何 耶 大 的 一 个 儿 子 是 ， 和 伦 人 参 巴 拉 的 女 婿 ， 我 就 从 我 这 里 把 他 赶 出 去 。 [kjv] And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me. [bbe] And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib, the chief priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: so I sent him away from me. 13:29 [hgb] 我 的 神 阿 ， 求 你 记 念 他 们 的 罪 。 因 为 他 们 玷 污 了 祭 司 的 职 任 ， 违 背 你 与 祭 司 利 未 人 所 立 的 约 。 [kjv] Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites. [bbe] Keep them in mind, O my God, because they have put shame on the priests\u0027 name and on the agreement of the priests and the Levites. 13:30 [hgb] 这 样 ， 我 洁 净 他 们 ， 使 他 们 离 绝 一 切 外 邦 人 ， 派 定 祭 司 和 利 未 人 的 班 次 ， 使 他 们 各 尽 其 职 。 [kjv] Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business; [bbe] So I made them clean from all strange people, and had regular watches fixed for the priests and for the Levites, everyone in his work; 13:31 [hgb] 我 又 派 百 姓 按 定 期 献 柴 ， 和 初 熟 的 土 产 。 我 的 神 阿 ， 求 你 记 念 我 ， 施 恩 与 我 。 [kjv] And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good. [bbe] And for the wood offering, at fixed times, and for the first fruits. Keep me in mind, O my God, for good.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/112/1603.html","bookId":184,"book":{"id":184,"title":"尼希米记Nehemiah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 哈 迦 利 亚 的 儿 子 尼 希 米 的 言 语 如 下 。 亚 达 薛 西 王 二 十 年 基 斯 流 月 ， 我 在 书 珊 城 的 宫 中 。 [kjv] The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah.
