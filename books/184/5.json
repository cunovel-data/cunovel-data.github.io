And I set a great assembly against them. \n [bbe] And after turning it over in my mind, I made a protest to the chiefs and the rulers, and said to them, Every one of you is taking interest from his countryman. And I got together a great meeting of protest. \n 5:8 [hgb] 我 对 他 们 说 ， 我 们 尽 力 赎 回 我 们 弟 兄 ， 就 是 卖 与 外 邦 的 犹 大 人 。 你 们 还 要 卖 弟 兄 ， 使 我 们 赎 回 来 吗 ？ 他 们 就 静 默 不 语 ， 无 话 可 答 。 \n [kjv] And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer. \n [bbe] And I said to them, We have given whatever we were able to give, to make our brothers the Jews free, who were servants and prisoners of the nations: and would you now give up your brothers for a price, and are they to become our property? Then they said nothing, answering not a word. \n 5:9 [hgb] 我 又 说 ， 你 们 所 行 的 不 善 。 你 们 行 事 不 当 敬 畏 我 们 的 神 吗 ？ 不 然 ， 难 免 我 们 的 仇 敌 外 邦 人 毁 谤 我 们 。 \n [kjv] Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies? \n [bbe] And I said, What you are doing is not good: is it not the more necessary for you to go in the fear of our God, because of the shame which the nations may put on us? \n 5:10 [hgb] 我 和 我 的 弟 兄 与 仆 人 ， 也 将 银 钱 粮 食 借 给 百 姓 。 我 们 大 家 都 当 免 去 利 息 。 \n [kjv] I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury. \n [bbe] Even I and my servants have been taking interest for the money and the grain we have let them have. So now, let us give up this thing. \n 5:11 [hgb] 如 今 我 劝 你 们 将 他 们 的 田 地 ， 葡 萄 园 ， 橄 榄 园 ， 房 屋 ， 并 向 他 们 所 取 的 银 钱 ， 粮 食 ， 新 酒 ， 和 油 ， 百 分 之 一 的 利 息 都 归 还 他 们 。 \n [kjv] Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them. \n [bbe] Give back to them this very day their fields, their vine-gardens, their olive-gardens, and their houses, as well as a hundredth part of the money and the grain and the wine and the oil which you have taken from them. \n 5:12 [hgb] 众 人 说 ， 我 们 必 归 还 ， 不 再 向 他 们 索 要 ， 必 照 你 的 话 行 。 我 就 召 了 祭 司 来 ， 叫 众 人 起 誓 ， 必 照 着 所 应 许 的 而 行 。 \n [kjv] Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise. \n [bbe] Then they said, We will give them back, and take nothing for them; we will do as you say. Then I sent for the priests and made them take an oath that they would keep this agreement. \n 5:13 [hgb] 我 也 抖 着 胸 前 的 衣 襟 ， 说 ， 凡 不 成 就 这 应 许 的 ， 愿 神 照 样 抖 他 离 开 家 产 和 他 劳 碌 得 来 的 ， 直 到 抖 空 了 。 会 众 都 说 ， 阿 们 。 又 赞 美 耶 和 华 。 百 姓 就 照 着 所 应 许 的 去 行 。 \n [kjv] Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise. \n [bbe] And shaking out the folds of my robe, I said, So may God send out from his house and his work every man who does not keep this agreement; even so let him be sent out and made as nothing. And all the meeting of the people said, So be it, and gave praise to the Lord. And the people did as they had said. \n 5:14 [hgb] 自 从 我 奉 派 作 犹 大 地 的 省 长 ， 就 是 从 亚 达 薛 西 王 二 十 年 ， 直 到 三 十 二 年 ， 共 十 二 年 之 久 ， 我 与 我 弟 兄 都 没 有 吃 省 长 的 俸 禄 。 \n [kjv] Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor. \n [bbe] Now from the time when I was made ruler of the people in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year till the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, for twelve years, I and my servants have never taken the food which was the right of the ruler. \n 5:15 [hgb] 在 我 以 前 的 省 长 加 重 百 姓 的 担 子 ， 每 日 索 要 粮 食 和 酒 ， 并 银 子 四 十 舍 客 勒 ， 就 是 他 们 的 仆 人 也 辖 制 百 姓 。 但 我 因 敬 畏 神 不 这 样 行 。 \n [kjv] But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God. \n [bbe] But earlier rulers who were before me made the people responsible for their upkeep, and took from them bread and wine at the rate of forty shekels of silver; and even their servants were lords over the people: but I did not do so, because of the fear of God. \n 5:16 [hgb] 并 且 我 恒 心 修 造 城 墙 ， 并 没 有 置 买 田 地 。 我 的 仆 人 也 都 聚 集 在 那 里 做 工 。 \n [kjv] Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work. \n [bbe] And I kept on with the work of this wall, and we got no land for ourselves: and all my servants were helping with the work. \n 5:17 [hgb] 除 了 从 四 围 外 邦 中 来 的 犹 大 人 以 外 ， 有 犹 大 平 民 和 官 长 一 百 五 十 人 在 我 席 上 吃 饭 。 \n [kjv] Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us. \n [bbe] And more than this, a hundred and fifty of the Jews and the rulers were guests at my table, in addition to those who came to us from the nations round about us. \n 5:18 [hgb] 每 日 预 备 一 只 公 牛 ， 六 只 肥 羊 ， 又 预 备 些 飞 禽 。 每 十 日 一 次 ， 多 预 备 各 样 的 酒 。 虽 然 如 此 ， 我 并 不 要 省 长 的 俸 禄 ， 因 为 百 姓 服 役 甚 重 。 \n [kjv] Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people. \n [bbe] Now the food made ready for one day was one ox and six fat sheep, as well as fowls; and once in ten days a store of all sorts of wine: but all the same, I did not take the food to which the ruler had a right, because the people were crushed under a hard yoke. \n 5:19 [hgb] 我 的 神 阿 ， 求 你 记 念 我 为 这 百 姓 所 行 的 一 切 事 ， 施 恩 与 我 。 \n [kjv] Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people. \n [bbe] Keep in mind, O my God, for my good, all I have done for this people. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/112/1595.html","bookId":184,"book":{"id":184,"title":"尼希米记Nehemiah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 哈 迦 利 亚 的 儿 子 尼 希 米 的 言 语 如 下 。 亚 达 薛 西 王 二 十 年 基 斯 流 月 ， 我 在 书 珊 城 的 宫 中 。 [kjv] The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah.
