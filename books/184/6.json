{"id":5746,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"6:1 [hgb] 参 巴 拉 ， 多 比 雅 ， 亚 拉 伯 人 基 善 ， 和 我 们 其 余 的 仇 敌 ， 听 见 我 已 经 修 完 了 城 墙 ， 其 中 没 有 破 裂 之 处 （ 那 时 我 还 没 有 安 门 扇 ） 。 [kjv] Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;) [bbe] Now when word was given to Sanballat and Tobiah and to Geshem the Arabian and to the rest of our haters, that I had done the building of the wall and that there were no more broken places in it (though even then I had not put up the doors in the doorways); 6:2 [hgb] 参 巴 拉 和 基 善 就 打 发 人 来 见 我 ， 说 ， 请 你 来 ， 我 们 在 阿 挪 平 原 的 一 个 村 庄 相 会 。 他 们 却 想 害 我 。 [kjv] That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief. [bbe] Sanballat and Geshem sent to me saying, Come, let us have a meeting in one of the little towns in the lowland of Ono. But their purpose was to do me evil. 6:3 [hgb] 于 是 我 差 遣 人 去 见 他 们 ， 说 ， 我 现 在 办 理 大 工 ， 不 能 下 去 。 焉 能 停 工 下 去 见 你 们 呢 ？ [kjv] And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you? [bbe] And I sent men to them saying, I am doing a great work, so that it is not possible for me to come down: is the work to be stopped while I go away from it and come down to you? 6:4 [hgb] 他 们 这 样 四 次 打 发 人 来 见 我 ， 我 都 如 此 回 答 他 们 。 [kjv] Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner. [bbe] And four times they sent to me in this way, and I sent them the same answer. 6:5 [hgb] 参 巴 拉 第 五 次 打 发 仆 人 来 见 我 ， 手 里 拿 着 未 封 的 信 ， [kjv] Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand; [bbe] Then Sanballat sent his servant to me a fifth time with an open letter in his hand; 6:6 [hgb] 信 上 写 着 说 ， 外 邦 人 中 有 风 声 ， 迦 施 慕 （ 就 是 基 善 见 二 章 十 九 节 ） 也 说 ， 你 和 犹 大 人 谋 反 ， 修 造 城 墙 ， 你 要 作 他 们 的 王 。 [kjv] Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words. [bbe] And in it these words were recorded: It is said among the nations, and Geshem says so, that you and the Jews are hoping to make yourselves free from the king\u0027s authority; and that this is why you are building the wall: and they say that it is your purpose to be their king; 6:7 [hgb] 你 又 派 先 知 在 耶 路 撒 冷 指 着 你 宣 讲 ， 说 在 犹 大 有 王 。 现 在 这 话 必 传 与 王 知 。 所 以 请 你 来 ， 与 我 们 彼 此 商 议 。 [kjv] And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together. [bbe] And that you have prophets preaching about you in Jerusalem, and saying, There is a king in Judah: now an account of these things will be sent to the king. So come now, and let us have a discussion. 6:8 [hgb] 我 就 差 遣 人 去 见 他 ， 说 ， 你 所 说 的 这 事 ， 一 概 没 有 ， 是 你 心 里 捏 造 的 。 [kjv] Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart. [bbe] Then I sent to him, saying, No such things as you say are being done, they are only a fiction you have made up yourself. 6:9 [hgb] 他 们 都 要 使 我 们 惧 怕 ， 意 思 说 ， 他 们 的 手 必 软 弱 ， 以 致 工 作 不 能 成 就 。 神 阿 ， 求 你 坚 固 我 的 手 。 [kjv] For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands. [bbe] For they were hoping to put fear in us, saying, Their hands will become feeble and give up the work so that it may not get done. But now, O God, make my hands strong. 6:10 [hgb] 我 到 了 米 希 大 别 的 孙 子 ， 第 来 雅 的 儿 子 示 玛 雅 家 里 。 那 时 ， 他 闭 门 不 出 。 他 说 ， 我 们 不 如 在 神 的 殿 里 会 面 ， 将 殿 门 关 锁 。 因 为 他 们 要 来 杀 你 ， 就 是 夜 里 来 杀 你 。 [kjv] Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee. [bbe] And I went to the house of Shemaiah, the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us have a meeting in the house of God, inside the Temple, and let the doors be shut: for they will come to put you to death; truly, in the night they will come to put you to death. 6:11 [hgb] 我 说 ， 像 我 这 样 的 人 岂 要 逃 跑 呢 ？ 像 我 这 样 的 人 岂 能 进 入 殿 里 保 全 生 命 呢 ？ 我 不 进 去 。 [kjv] And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in. [bbe] And I said, Am I the sort of man to go in flight? what man, in my position, would go into the Temple to keep himself safe? I will not go in. 6:12 [hgb] 我 看 明 神 没 有 差 遣 他 ， 是 他 自 己 说 这 话 攻 击 我 ， 是 多 比 雅 和 参 巴 拉 贿 买 了 他 。 [kjv] And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. [bbe] Then it became clear to me that God had not sent him: he had given this word of a prophet against me himself: and Tobiah and Sanballat had given him money to do so. 6:13 [hgb] 贿 买 他 的 缘 故 ， 是 要 叫 我 惧 怕 ， 依 从 他 犯 罪 ， 他 们 好 传 扬 恶 言 毁 谤 我 。 [kjv] Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me. [bbe] For this reason they had given him money, in order that I might be overcome by fear and do what he said and do wrong, and so they would have reason to say evil about me and put shame on me. 6:14 [hgb] 我 的 神 阿 ， 多 比 雅 ， 参 巴 拉 ， 女 先 知 挪 亚 底 ， 和 其 余 的 先 知 要 叫 我 惧 怕 ， 求 你 记 念 他 们 所 行 的 这 些 事 。 [kjv] My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear. [bbe] Keep in mind, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat and what they did, and Noadiah, the woman prophet, and the rest of the prophets whose purpose was to put fear into me. 6:15 [hgb] 以 禄 月 二 十 五 日 ， 城 墙 修 完 了 ， 共 修 了 五 十 二 天 。 [kjv] So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days. [bbe] So the wall was complete on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty-two days. 6:16 [hgb] 我 们 一 切 仇 敌 ， 四 围 的 外 邦 人 听 见 了 便 惧 怕 ， 愁 眉 不 展 。 因 为 见 这 工 作 完 成 是 出 乎 我 们 的 神 。 [kjv] And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God. [bbe] And when our haters had news of this, all the nations round about us were full of fear and were greatly shamed, for they saw that this work had been done by our God. 6:17 [hgb] 在 那 些 日 子 ， 犹 大 的 贵 胄 屡 次 寄 信 与 多 比 雅 ， 多 比 雅 也 来 信 与 他 们 。 [kjv] Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them. [bbe] And further, in those days the chiefs of Judah sent a number of letters to Tobiah, and his letters came to them. 6:18 [hgb] 在 犹 大 有 许 多 人 与 多 比 雅 结 盟 。 因 他 是 亚 拉 的 儿 子 ， 示 迦 尼 的 女 婿 ， 并 且 他 的 儿 子 ， 约 哈 难 娶 了 比 利 迦 儿 子 ， 米 书 兰 的 女 儿 为 妻 。 [kjv] For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah. [bbe] For in Judah there were a number of people who had made an agreement by oath with him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah, the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken as his wife the daughter of Meshullam, the son of Berechiah. 6:19 [hgb] 他 们 常 在 我 面 前 说 多 比 雅 的 善 行 ， 也 将 我 的 话 传 与 他 。 多 比 雅 又 常 寄 信 来 ， 要 叫 我 惧 怕 。 [kjv] Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear. [bbe] And they said much before me of the good he had done, and gave him accounts of my words. And Tobiah sent letters with the purpose of causing me fear.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/112/1596.html","bookId":184,"book":{"id":184,"title":"尼希米记Nehemiah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 哈 迦 利 亚 的 儿 子 尼 希 米 的 言 语 如 下 。 亚 达 薛 西 王 二 十 年 基 斯 流 月 ， 我 在 书 珊 城 的 宫 中 。 [kjv] The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah.
