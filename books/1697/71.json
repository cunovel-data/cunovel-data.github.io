Beyond knowing—and most im portant, not worth knowing.\\n\\n But this…He expanded the N-dimensional landscape, horizons thrusting away along axes he could barely grasp.\\n\\n Everywhere, the Empire bristled with…life. Patterns the equations picked out, luminous snaking pathways of data/knowledge/wisdom. All unknown to any human.\\n\\n To anyone, until this moment.\\n\\n Psychohistory had discovered an entity greater than human, though of humanity.\\n\\n He saw suddenly that the Empire had its own landscape, greater and more subtle than anything he had suspected. The Empire’s complex adaptive system had achieved a “poised” state, hovering in the margin between order and full-spectral chaos. There it had sat for millennia, accomplishing ends and tasks that no one knew. It could adapt, evolve. Its apparent “stasis” was in fact evidence that the Empire had found the peak in a huge fitness-landscape.\\n\\n And as Hari watched, the Empire veered toward the canyons of disorder.\\n\\n Hari! Terrible things are happening. Come!\\n\\n He yearned to stay, to learn more…but the voice was Dors’.\\n\\n 14.\\n\\n Daneel said bleakly, “My agents, my brethren…all dead.”\\n\\n The robot sat slumped over in Hari’s office. Dors comforted him. Hari rubbed his eyes, still recovering from the digital immersion. Things were moving too fast, far too—\\n\\n “Tiktoks! They attacked my, my…” Daneel could not go on.\\n\\n “Where?” Dors asked.\\n\\n “All over Trantor! You and I, and a few dozen others, only we survive…” Daneel buried his face in his hands.\\n\\n Dors grimaced. “This must have something to do with Lamurk, his death.”\\n\\n “Indirectly, yes.”\\n\\n Both robots looked at Hari. He leaned against his desk, still weak. He studied them for a long moment. “It was part of a lar-ger…deal.”\\n\\n “For what?” Dors asked.\\n\\n “To end the tiktok revolt. My calculations showed that it would have spread rapidly through the Empire. Fatally.”\\n\\n “A bargain?” Daneel pressed his lips into thin pale wedges.\\n\\n Hari blinked rapidly, fighting a leaden weight of guilt. “One I did not fully control.”\\n\\n Dors said icily, “You used me in it, didn’t you? I handled the data Daneel sent, locations of Lamurk’s allies—”\\n\\n “And I had it relayed to the tiktoks, yes,” Hari said soberly. “Not a difficult technical trick, if you have help from Mesh-space.”\\n\\n Daneel’s eyes narrowed at this last reference. Then he relaxed his face and said, “So the tiktoks killed Lamurk’s men and women. You knew I would not allow such a mass murder, even to assist you.”\\n\\n Hari nodded soberly. “I understand the constraints you act under. The Zeroth Law demands rather high standards and my fate as First Minister would not justify such a breach of the First Law.”\\n\\n Daneel stared stonily at Hari. “So you got around that. You used me and my robots as, as spotters.”\\n\\n “Exactly. The tiktoks closely shadowed your robots. They are rather dumb creatures, devoid of subtlety. But they do not labor under the First Law. Once they knew who to hit, I only needed give the signal for when to strike.”\\n\\n “The signal—when you began your speech,” Dors said. “Lamurk’s allies would be sitting before screens and watching. Easily reached and already distracted by you.”\\n\\n Hari sighed. “Exactly.”\\n\\n “This is so unlike you, Hari,” Dors said.\\n\\n “And about time, too,” Hari said sharply. “Again and again they tried to kill me. They would have succeeded, eventually, even if I never became First Minister.”\\n\\n Dors said with a trace of sympathy, “I would never have suspec ted you of such…cool motives.”\\n\\n Hari gazed at her bleakly. “Me either. The only reason I could bring myself to do it was that I could see the future—my future—so plainly.”\\n\\n Daneel’s face was a swirl of emotion, something Hari had never witnessed before. “But my brethren—why them? I cannot compre hend. For what reason did they die?”\\n\\n “My deal.” Hari said, throat tight. “And I have just been double-crossed.”\\n\\n “You did not know robots would die?”\\n\\n Hari shook his head sadly. “No. I should have seen it, though. It is obvious!” He smacked himself in the head. “Once the tiktoks had done my job, they could do the work of the memes.”\\n\\n “Memes?” Daneel asked.\\n\\n “Deal…for what?” Dors asked sharply.\\n\\n “To end the tiktok revolt.” Hari looked at Dors, avoiding Daneel’s gaze. “My calculations showed that it would have spread rapidly through the Empire. Fatally.”\\n\\n Daneel stood. “I understand your right to make human decisions about human lives. We robots cannot fathom how you can think in these ways, but then, we are not built to do so. Still, Hari!—you made a bargain with forces you do not understand.”\\n\\n “I didn’t see their next move.” Hari felt miserable, but a part of him noted that Daneel already grasped who the memes were.\\n\\n Dors did not. “Whose move?” she demanded.\\n\\n “The ancients,” Hari said. He explained in halting phrases. Of his recent explorations of the Mesh. Of the labyrinth-minds who resided in those digital spaces, cold and analytical in their revenge.\\n\\n “We robots left those?” Daneel whispered. “I had suspected…”\\n\\n “They eluded you in the early, rough stages of our expansion into the Galaxy. Or so they say.” Hari looked away from Dors, who still gazed at him in silent shock.\\n\\n Daneel asked cautiously, “Where were they?”\\n\\n “The huge structures at the Galactic Center—you’ve seen them?”\\n\\n “So that was where these electromagnetic presences were hiding?”\\n\\n “For a while. They came to Trantor long ago, when the Mesh\\n\\n became large enough to support them. They live in the nooks and crannies of our digital webs. As the Mesh grows, so do they. Now they’re strong enough to strike. They might have waited longer, gotten better—except that two sims I found provoked them.”\\n\\n Daneel said slowly, “Those Sarkian sims: Joan and Voltaire.”\\n\\n “You know of them?” Hari asked.\\n\\n “I…tried to stunt their impact. Sarkian modes are bad for the\\n\\n Empire. I employed that Nim fellow, but he proved inept.”\\n\\n Hari smiled wanly. “His heart wasn’t in it. He liked those sims.”\\n\\n “I should have sensed that,” Daneel said.\\n\\n “You have some ability to perceive our mental states, don’t you?” Hari asked.\\n\\n “It is limited. Patterns are more easily sensed if the subject has had a certain childhood disease, as it happens, and Nim was lacking that. Still, I know that humans are fond of seeing their kind rendered in other media.”\\n\\n Such as robots? Hari thought. Then why have we had taboos against them since antiquity? Dors was watching the two of them, aware that they were feeling each other out over murky territory.\\n\\n Hari said carefully, “The meme-minds blocked Nim when he searched for the sims in the Mesh. But he worked out quite well when I needed help interfacing with the Mesh. I’ll pardon the fellow, when this is over.”\\n\\n Daneel said coldly, “Those sims and their kind—they are still dangerous, Hari. I beg you—”\\n\\n “Don’t worry, I know that. I’ll deal with them. It’s the meme-minds that worry me now.”\\n\\n “And these minds hate us all?” Dors asked slowly, trying to grasp these ideas.\\n\\n “Humans? Yes, but not nearly so much as your kind, m’love.”\\n\\n “Us?” She blinked.\\n\\n “Robots did damage to them long ago.”\\n\\n “Yes!” Daneel said sternly. “To protect humanity.”\\n\\n “And those older intelligences hate your kind for your brutality. By the time the fleets of robo-explorers were done, we found a Galaxy suitable for benign farming.” Hari flicked on his holo. “Here’s an image I brought from the meme-minds.”\\n\\n Across a darkling plain swept a line of yellow. Harsh winds drove it forward as it consumed the tall stands of lush grass. Licking flames reached and ate and reached again. From the bright burning line of attack rose billowing, leaden smoke.\\n\\n “A prairie fire,” Hari said. “That is how the robot-explorers of twenty thousand years ago looked to those ancient minds.”\\n\\n “Burning up the Galaxy?” Dors said hollowly.\\n\\n “Making it safe for the precious humans,” Hari said.\\n\\n “For this,” Daneel said, “they wish revenge. But why now?”\\n\\n “They are at last able…and they finally detected you robots, dis tinguishing you from the tiktoks.”\\n\\n Daneel asked stonily, “How?”\\n\\n “When they found the sims I had revived. Working backward from them, to me, they found Dors. Then you.”\\n\\n “They can survey that widely?” Dors asked.\\n\\n Hari said, “All digital information from surveillance cameras, from snooper pickups, microdevices—they can fish in that sea.”\\n\\n “You helped them,” Daneel said.\\n\\n “For the good of the Empire I made my deal with them.”\\n\\n Daneel said, “They first killed the Lamurkians, then turned on my robots. Assigning a dozen tiktoks to each, they overwhelmed our kind.”\\n\\n “All of us?” Dors whispered.\\n\\n “About a third of us escaped.” Daneel allowed himself a hard smile. “We are far more capable than these…automatons.”\\n\\n Hari nodded sadly. “That was not in the deal. They…used me.”\\n\\n “I think we are all being used.” Daneel cast a sour glance at Hari. “In different ways.”\\n\\n “I had to do it, friend Daneel.”\\n\\n Dors stared at Hari. “I scarcely know you.”\\n\\n Hari said softly, “Sometimes being human is harder than it looks.”\\n\\n Dors’ eyes flashed. “Aliens slaughtering my kind!”\\n\\n “I had to find a solution—”\\n\\n She said, “Robots, especially the humaniforms—they’re servants, they—”\\n\\n “My love, you are more human than anyone I’ve known.”\\n\\n “But—murder!”\\n\\n “There was going to be murder anyway. The ancient memes could not be stopped.” Hari sighed and realized how far he had come. This was power, hovering above all and seeing the world as a vast arena, its clashes unending. He had become part of that and knew he could not go back to being the simple mathist ever again.\\n\\n Dors demanded, “Why are you so sure? You could have told us, we could—”\\n\\n “They knew you already. If I had stalled, they would have taken you two, gone hunting for the rest.”\\n\\n Daneel asked sternly, “And…for us?”\\n\\n “Both of you I saved. Part of the deal.”\\n\\n Daneel wilted then. “Thank you…I suppose.”\\n\\n Hari gazed at his old friend, eyes misting. “You…are carrying too much weight.”\\n\\n Daneel nodded. “I carried out the imperative and obeyed you.”\\n\\n Hari nodded. “Lamurk. I was there. Your insects fried him.”\\n\\n “Or appeared to.”\\n\\n “What?” Hari stared as Daneel pressed a button on his wrist, then turned to the office door. Through it, pausing slightly for the security screen, stepped a man of unremarkable looks in a brown workman’s coverall.\\n\\n “Our Mister Lamurk,” Daneel said. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/foundation-s-fear-second-foundation-trilogy-1/page-71.html","bookId":1697,"book":{"id":1697,"title":"Foundation\u0027s Fear ( Second Foundation Trilogy #1)","description":"Storyline: Foundation\u0027s Fear (Second Foundation Trilogy #1) \\n Isaac Asimov\u0027s Foundation Trilogy is one of the high-water marks of science fiction.
