{"id":28217,"no":33,"title":"Chapter 33","content":"Two days after a cab with a musket barrel protruding from eitherwindow stopped before the bookbinder\u0027s shop. The two NationalGuards who stumbled out of it demanded to see the citizen JeanServien, handed him a sealed packet and signed to him to openthe door wide and wait for them. Next minute they reappearedcarrying a full-length portrait. It represented a woman of forty or thereabouts, with a yellowface, very long and disproportionately large for the frail, sicklybody it surmounted, and dressed in an unpretending black gown. She wore a sad, submissive look. Her grey eyes bespoke a contriteand fearful heart, the cheeks were pendulous and the loose chinalmost touched the bosom. Jean scrutinized the poor, pitifulface, but could recall no memory in connection with it. He openedthe letter and read: \"_Commune of Paris--General Staff_. \"Order to deliver to the citizen Jean Servien the portrait of Madame Bargemont. \"Tudesco. \"Colonel commanding the Subterranean Ways of the Commune.\"Jean wanted to ask the National Guards what it all meant, butalready the cab was driving off, bayonets protruding from bothwindows. The passers-by, who had long ceased to be surprised atanything, cast a momentary glance after the retreating vehicle. Jean, left alone with Madame Bargemont\u0027s portrait before him,began to ask himself why his disconcerting friend Tudesco hadsent it to him. \"The wretch,\" he told himself, \"must have arrested Bargemont andsacked his apartments.\"Meantime Madame Bargemont was gazing at him with a martyr\u0027s hauntingeyes. She looked so unhappy that Jean was filled with pity. \"Poor woman!\" he ejaculated, and turning the canvas face to thewall, he left the house.

He scratched his head, wondering ifthis could be the actress his son was in love with. He opined shemust be mightily taken with the young man to send him so largea portrait in so handsome a frame. He could not see anything tocapture a lover\u0027s fancy. \"At any rate,\" he thought, \"she does not look like a bad woman.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3037/83935.html","bookId":1057,"book":{"id":1057,"title":"The Aspirations of Jean Servien","description":"简介： Jean Servien was born in a back-shop in the _Rue Notre-Damedes Champs_.
