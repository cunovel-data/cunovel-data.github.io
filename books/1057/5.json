He selected a day-school notfar from the Luxembourg, because he could see the top branchesof an acacia overtopping the wall, and the house had a cheerfullook. Jean, as a little new boy (he was now eleven), was some weeksbefore he shook off the shyness with which his schoolfellows\u0027 loud voices and rough ways and his masters\u0027 ponderous gravityhad at first overwhelmed him. Little by little he grew used tothe work, and learned some of the tricks by means of whichpunishments were avoided; his schoolfellows found him so inoffensivethey left off stealing his cap and initiated him in the game ofmarbles. But he had little love for school-life, and when fiveo\u0027clock came, prayers were over and his satchel strapped, itwas with unfeigned delight he dashed out into the street baskingin the golden rays of the setting sun.

His sister made fruitless efforts to distract his attention withsome stinging criticism of the neighbours or a question about\"our fat friend who had not come back,\" for she made a pointof never remembering the Marquis Tudesco\u0027s name. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3037/83907.html","bookId":1057,"book":{"id":1057,"title":"The Aspirations of Jean Servien","description":"简介： Jean Servien was born in a back-shop in the _Rue Notre-Damedes Champs_.
