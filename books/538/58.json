{"id":10530,"no":58,"title":"Chapter 58","content":"The night was strangely solemn and still. In the small hours she whispered to him the whole story of how he had walked in his sleep with her in his arms across the Froom stream, at the imminent risk of both their lives, and laid her down in the stone coffin at the ruined abbey. He had never known of that till now. \n `Why didn\u0027t you tell me next day?\u0027 he said. `It might have prevented much misunderstanding and woe.\u0027 \n `Don\u0027t think of what\u0027s past!\u0027 said she. `I am not going to think outside of now. Why should we! Who knows what to-morrow has in store?\u0027 \n But it apparently had no sorrow. The morning was wet and foggy, and Clare, rightly informed that the caretaker only opened the windows on fine days, ventured to creep out of their chamber, and explore the house, leaving Tess asleep. There was no food on the premises, but there was water, and he took advantage of the fog to emerge from the mansion, and fetch tea, bread, and butter from a shop in a little place two miles beyond, as also a small tin kettle and spirit-lamp, that they might get fire without smoke. His re-entry awoke her; and they breakfasted on what he had brought. \n They were indisposed to stir abroad, and the day passed, and the night following, and the next, and next; till, almost without their being aware, five days had slipped by in absolute seclusion, not a sight or sound of a human being disturbing their peacefulness, such as it was. The changes of the weather were their only events, the birds of the New Forest their only company. By tacit consent they hardly once spoke of any incident of the past subsequent to their wedding-day. The gloomy intervening time seemed to sink into chaos, over which the present and prior times closed as if it never had been. Whenever he suggested that they should leave their shelter, and go forwards towards Southampton or London, she showed a strange unwillingness to move. \n `Why should we put an end to all that\u0027s sweet and lovely!\u0027 she deprecated. `What must come will come.\u0027 And, looking through the shutter-chink: `All is trouble outside there; inside here content.\u0027 \n He peeped out also. It was quite true; within was affection, union, error forgiven: outside was the inexorable. \n `And - and,\u0027 she said, pressing her cheek against his; `I fear that what you think of me now may not last. I do not wish to outlive your present feeling for me. I would rather not. I would rather be dead and buried when the time comes for you to despise me, so that it may never be known to me that you despised me.\u0027 \n `I cannot ever despise you.\u0027 \n `I also hope that. But considering what my life has been I cannot see why any man should, sooner or later, be able to help despising me... .How wickedly mad I was! Yet formerly I never could bear to hurt a fly or a worm, and the sight of a bird in a cage used often to make me cry.\u0027 \n They remained yet another day. In the night the dull sky cleared, and the result was that the old caretaker at the cottage awoke early. The brilliant sunrise made her unusually brisk; she decided to open the contiguous mansion immediately, and to air it thoroughly on such a day. Thus it occurred that, having arrived and opened the lower rooms before six o\u0027clock, she ascended to the bedchambers, and was about to turn the handle of the one wherein they lay. At that moment she fancied she could hear the breathing of persons within. Her slippers and her antiquity had rendered her progress a noiseless one so far, and she made for instant retreat; then, deeming that her hearing might have deceived her, she turned around, to the door and softly tried the handle. The lock was out of order, but a piece of furniture had been moved forward on the inside, which prevented her opening the door more than an inch or two. A stream of morning light through the shutter-chink fell upon the faces of the pair, wrapped in profound slumber, Tess\u0027s lips being parted like a half-opened flower near his cheek. The caretaker was so struck with their innocent appearance, and with the elegance of Tess\u0027s gown hanging across a chair, her silk stockings beside it, the pretty parasol, and the other habits in which she bad arrived because she had none else, that her first indignation at the effrontery of tramps and vagabonds gave way to a momentary sentimentality over this genteel elopement, as it seemed. She closed the door, and withdrew as softly as she had come, to go and consult with her neighbours on the odd discovery. \n Not more than a minute had elapsed after her withdrawal when Tess woke, and then Clare. Both had a sense that something had disturbed them, though they could not say what; and the uneasy feeling which it engendered grew stronger. As soon as he was dressed he narrowly scanned the lawn through the two or three inches of shutter-chink. \n `I think we will leave at once,\u0027 said he. `It is a fine day. And I cannot help fancying somebody is about the house. At any rate, the woman will be sure to come to-day.\u0027 \n She passively assented, and putting the room in order they took up the few articles that belongef to them, and departed noiselessly. When they had got into the Forest she turned to take a last look at the house. \n `Ah, happy house - good-bye!\u0027 she said. `My life can only be a question of a few weeks. Why should we not have stayed there?\u0027 \n `Don\u0027t say it, Tess! We shall soon get out of this district altogether. We\u0027ll continue our course as we\u0027ve begun it, and keep straight north. Nobody will think of looking for us there. We shall be looked for at the Wessex ports if we are sought at all. When we are in the north we will get to a port and away.\u0027 \n Having thus persuaded her the plan was pursued, and they kept a bee line northward. Their long repose at the manor-house lent them walking power now; and towards mid-day they found that they were approaching the steepled city of Melchester, which lay directly in their way. He decided to rest her in a clump of trees during the afternoon, and push onward under cover of darkness. At dusk Clare purchased food as usual, and their night march began, the boundary between Upper and Mid-Wessex being crossed about eight o\u0027clock. \n To walk across country without much regard to roads was not new to Tess, and she showed her old agility in the performance. The intercepting city, ancient Melchester, they were obliged to pass through in order to take advantage of the town bridge for crossing a large river that obstructed them. It was about midnight when they went along the deserted streets, lighted fitfully by the few lamps, keeping off the pavement that it might not echo their footsteps. The graceful pile of cathedral architecture rose dimly on their left hand, but it was lost upon them now. Once out of the town they followed the turnpike-road, which after a few miles plunged across an open plain. \n Though the sky was dense with cloud a diffused light from some fragment of a moon had hitherto helped them a little. But the moon had now sunk, the clouds seemed to settle almost on their heads, and the night grew as dark as a cave. However, they found their way along, keeping as much on the turf as possible that their tread might not resound, which it was easy to do, there being no hedge or fence of any kind. All around was open loneliness and black solitude, over which a stiff breeze blew. \n They had proceeded thus gropingly two or three miles further when on a sudden Clare became conscious of some vast erection close in his front, rising sheer from the grass. They had almost struck themselves against it. \n `What monstrous place is this?\u0027 said Angel. \n `It hums,\u0027 said she. `Hearken!\u0027 \n He listened. The wind, playing upon the edifice, produced a booming tune, like the note of some gigantic one-stringed harp. No other sound came from it, and lifting his hand and advancing a step or two, Clare felt the vertical surface of the structure. It seemed to be of solid stone, without joint or moulding. Carrying his fingers onward he found that what he had come in contact with was a colossal rectangular pillar; by stretching out his left hand he could feel a similar one adjoining. At an indefinite height overhead something made the black sky blacker, which had the semblance of a vast architrave uniting the pillars horizontally. They carefully entered beneath and between; the surfaces echoed their soft rustle; but they seemed to be still out of doors. The place was roofless. Tess drew her breath fearfully, and Angel, perplexed, said-- \n `What can it be?\u0027 \n Feeling sideways they encountered another tower-like pillar, square and uncompromising as the first; beyond it another and another. The place was all doors and pillars, some connected above by continuous architraves. \n `A very Temple of the Winds,\u0027 he said. \n The next pillar was isolated; others composed a trilithon; others were prostrate, their flanks forming a causeway wide enough for a carriage; and it was soon obvious that they made up a forest of monoliths grouped upon the grassy expanse of the plain. The couple advanced further into this pavilion of the night till they stood in its midst. \n `It is Stonehenge!\u0027 said Clare. \n `The heathen temple, you mean?\u0027 \n `Yes. Older than the centuries; older than the d\u0027Urbervilles! Well, what shall we do, darling? We may find shelter further on.\u0027 But Tess, really tired by this time, flung herself upon an oblong slab that lay close at hand, and was sheltered from the wind by a pillar. Owing to the action of the sun during the preceding day the stone was warm and dry, in comforting contrast to the rough and chill grass around, which had damped her skirts and shoes. \n `I don\u0027t want to go any further, Angel,\u0027 she said stretching out her hand for his. `Can\u0027t we bide here?\u0027 \n `I fear not. This spot is visible for miles by day, although it does not seem so now.\u0027 \n `One of my mother\u0027s people was a shepherd hereabouts, now I think of it. And you used to say at Talbothays that I was a heathen. So now I am at home.\u0027 \n He knelt down beside her outstretched form, and put his lips upon hers. \n `Sleepy are you, dear? I think you are lying on an altar.\u0027 \n `I like very much to be here,\u0027 she murmured. `It is so solemn and lonely - after my great happiness - with nothing but the sky above my face. It seems as if there were no folk in the world but we two; and I wish there were not - except \u0027Liza-Lu.\u0027 \n Clare thought she might as well rest here till it should get a little lighter, and he flung his overcoat upon her, and sat down by her side. \n `Angel, if anything happens to me, will you watch over \u0027Liza-Lu for my sake?\u0027 she asked, when they had listened a long time to the wind among the pillars. \n `I will.\u0027 \n `She is so good and simple and pure. O, Angel - I wish you would marry her if you lose me, as you will do shortly. O, if you would!\u0027 \n `If I lose you I lose all! And she is my sister-in-law.\u0027 \n `That\u0027s nothing, dearest. People marry sister-laws continually about Marlott; and \u0027Liza-Lu is so gentle and sweet, and she is growing so beautiful. O I could share you with her willingly when we are spirits! If you would train her and teach her, Angel, and bring her up for your own self!... She has all the best of me without the bad of me; and if she were to become yours it would almost seem as if death had not divided us... .Well, I have said it. I won\u0027t mention it again.\u0027 \n She ceased, and he fell into thought. In the far north-east sky he could see between the pillars a level streak of light. The uniform concavity of black cloud was lifting bodily like the lid of a pot, letting in at the earth\u0027s edge the coming day, against which the towering monoliths and trilithons began to be blackly defined. \n `Did they sacrifice to God here?\u0027 asked she. \n `No,\u0027 said he. \n `Who to?\u0027 \n `I believe to the sun. That lofty stone set away by itself is in the direction of the sun, which will presently rise behind it.\u0027 \n `This reminds me, dear,\u0027 she said. `You remember you never would interfere with any belief of mine before we were married? But I knew your mind all the same, and I thought as you thought - not from any reasons of my own, but because you thought so. Tell me now, Angel, do you think we shall meet again after we are dead? I want to know.\u0027 \n He kissed her to avoid a reply at such a time. \n `O, Angel - I fear that means no!\u0027 said she, with a suppressed sob. `And I wanted so to see you again - so much, so much! What not even you and I, Angel, who love each other so well?\u0027 Like a greater than himself, to the critical question at the critical time he did not answer; and they were again silent. In a minute or two her breathing became more regular, her clasp of his hand relaxed, and she fell asleep. The band of silver paleness along the east horizon made even the distant parts of the Great Plain appear dark and near; and the whole enormous landscape bore that impress of reserve, taciturnity, and hesitation which is usual just before day. The eastward pillars and their architraves stood up blackly against the light, and the great flame-shaped Sun-stone beyond them; and the Stone of Sacrifice midway. Presently the night wind died out, and the quivering little pools in the cup-like hollows of the stones lay still. At the same time something seemed to move on the verge of the dip eastward - a mere dot. It was the head of a man approaching them from the hollow beyond the Sun-stone. Clare wished they had gone onward, but in the circumstances decided to remain quiet. The figure came straight towards the circle of pillars in which they were. \n He heard something behind him, the brush of feet. Turning, he saw over the prostrate columns another figure; then before he was aware, another was at hand on the right, under a trilithon, and another on the left. The dawn shone full on the front of the man westward, and Clare could discern from this that he was tall, and walked as if trained. They all closed in with evident purpose. Her story then was true! Springing to his feet, he looked around for a weapon, loose stone, means of escape, anything. By this time the nearest man was upon him. \n `It is no use, sir,\u0027 he said. `There are sixteen of us on the Plain, and the whole country is reared.\u0027 \n `Let her finish her sleep!\u0027 he implored in a whisper of the men as they gathered round. \n When they saw where she lay, which they had not done till then, they showed no objection, and stood watching her, as still as the pillars around. He went to the stone and bent over her, holding one poor little hand; her breathing now was quick and small, like that of a lesser creature than a woman. All waited in the growing light, their faces and hands as if they were silvered, the remainder of their figures dark, the stones glistening green-gray, the Plain still a mass of shade. Soon the light was strong, and a ray shone upon her unconscious form, peering under her eyelids and waking her. \n `What is it, Angel?\u0027 she said, starting up. `Have they come for me?\u0027 \n `Yes, dearest,\u0027 he said. `They have come.\u0027 \n `It is as it should be,\u0027 she murmured. `Angel, I am almost glad - yes, glad! This happiness could not have lasted. It was too much. I have had enough; and now I shall not live for you to despise me!\u0027 She stood up, shook herself, and went forward, neither of the men having moved. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/80/4753.html","bookId":538,"book":{"id":538,"title":"Tess of the D‘Urbervilles德伯家的苔丝","description":"简介： 《德伯家的苔丝》是哈代的代表作，是威塞克斯系列中的一部。它描写了一位农村姑娘的悲惨命运。哈代在小说的副标题中称女主人公为一个纯洁的女人，公开地向维多利亚时代虚伪的社会道德挑战。女主人公苔丝生于一个贫苦小贩家庭，父母要她到一个富老太婆家去攀亲戚，结果她...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12889203079f0f8.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/80","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
