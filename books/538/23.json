{"id":10495,"no":23,"title":"Chapter 23","content":"The hot weather of July had crept upon them unawares, and the atmosphere of the flat vale hung heavy as an opiate over the dairy-folk, the cows, and the trees. Hot steaming rains fell frequently, making the grass where the cows fed yet more rank, and hindering the late haymaking in the other meads. It was Sunday morning; the milking was done; the outdoor milkers had gone home. Tess and the other three were dressing themselves rapidly, the whole bevy having agreed to go together to Mellstock Church, which lay some three or four miles distant from the dairy-house. She had now been two months at Talbothays, and this was her first excursion. All the preceding afternoon and night heavy thunderstorms had hissed down upon the meads, and washed some of the hay into the river; but this morning the sun shone out all the more brilliantly for the deluge, and the air was balmy and clear. The crooked lane leading from their own parish to Mellstock ran along the lowest levels in a portion of its length, and when the girls reached the most depressed spot they found that the result of the rain had been to flood the lane over-shoe to a distance of some fifty yards. This would have been no serious hindrance on a week-day; they would have clicked through it in their high pattens and boots quite unconcerned; but on this day of vanity, this Sun\u0027s-day, when flesh went forth to coquet with flesh while hypocritically affecting business with spiritual things; on this occasion for wearing their white stockings and thin shoes, and their pink, white, and lilac gowns, on which every mud spot would be visible, the pool was an awkward impediment. They could hear the church-bell calling - as yet nearly a mile off. `Who would have expected such a rise in the river in summertime!\u0027 said Marian, from the top of the roadside-bank on which they had climbed, and were maintaining a precarious footing in the hope of creeping along its slope till they were past the pool. `We can\u0027t get there anyhow, without walking right through it, or else going round the Turnpike way; and that would make us so very late!\u0027 said Retty, pausing hopelessly. `And I do colour up so hot, walking into church late, and all the people staring round,\u0027 said Marian,\u0027 that I hardly cool down again till we get into the That-it-may-please-Thees.\u0027 While they stood clinging to the bank they heard a splashing round the bend of the road, and presently appeared Angel Clare, advancing along the lane towards them through the water. Four hearts gave a big throb simultaneously. His aspect was probably as un-Sabbatarian a one as a dogmatic parson\u0027s son often presented; his attire being his dairy clothes, long wading boots, a cabbage-leaf inside his hat to keep his head cool, with a thistle-spud to finish him off. `He\u0027s not going to church,\u0027 said Marian. `No - I wish he was!\u0027 murmured Tess. Angel, in fact, rightly or wrongly (to adopt the safe phrase of evasive controversialists), preferred sermons in stones to sermons in churches and chapels on fine summer days. This morning, moreover, he had gone out to see if the damage to the hay by the flood was considerable or not. On his walk he observed the girls from a long distance, though they had been so occupied with their difficulties of passage as not to notice him. He knew that the water had risen at that spot, and that it would quite check their progress. So he had hastened on, with a dim idea of how he could help them - one of them in particular. The rosy-cheeked, bright-eyed quartet looked so charming in their light summer attire, clinging to the roadside bank like pigeons on a roof-slope, that he stopped a moment to regard them before coming close. Their gauzy skirts had brushed up from the grass innumerable files and butterflies which, unable to escape, remained caged in the transparent tissue as in an aviary. Angel\u0027s eye at last fell upon Tess, the hindmost of the four; she, being full of suppressed laughter at their dilemma, could not help meeting his glance radiantly. He came beneath them in the water, which did not rise over his long boots; and stood looking at the entrapped flies and butterflies. `Are you trying to get to church?\u0027 he said to Marian, who was in front, including the next two in his remark, but avoiding Tess. `Yes, sir; and \u0027tis getting late; and my colour do come up so--\u0027 `I\u0027ll carry you through the pool - every Jill of you.\u0027 The whole four flushed as if one heart beat through them. `I think you can\u0027t, sir,\u0027 said Marian. `It is the only way for you to get past. Stand still. Nonsense - you are not too heavy! I\u0027d carry you all four together. Now, Marian, attend,\u0027 he continued, `and put your arms round my shoulders, so. Now! Hold on. That\u0027s well done.\u0027 Marian had lowered herself upon his arm and shoulder as directed, and Angel strode off with her, his slim figure, as viewed from behind, looking like the mere stem to the great nosegay suggested by hers. They disappeared round the curve of the road, and only his sousing footsteps and the top ribbon of Marian\u0027s bonnet told where they were. In a few minutes he reappeared. Izz Huett was the next in order upon the bank. `Here he comes,\u0027 she murmured, and they could hear that her lips were dry with emotion. `And I have to put my arms round his neck and look into his face as Marian did.\u0027 `There\u0027s nothing in that,\u0027 said Tess quickly. `There\u0027s a time for everything,\u0027 continued Izz, unheeding. `A time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; the first is now going to be mine.\u0027 `Fie - it is Scripture, Izz!\u0027 `Yes,\u0027 said Izz, `I\u0027ve always a\u0027 ear at church for pretty verses.\u0027 Angel Clare, to whom three-quarters of this performance was a commonplace act of kindness, now approached Izz. She quietly and dreamily lowered herself into his arms, and Angel methodically marched off with her. When he was heard returning for the third time Retty\u0027s throbbing heart could be almost seen to shake her. He went up to the red-haired girl, and while he was seizing her he glanced at Tess. His lips could not have pronounced more plainly, `It will soon be you and J.\u0027 Her comprehension appeared in her face; she could not help it. There was an understanding between them. Poor little Retty, though by far the lightest weight, was the most troublesome of Clare\u0027s burdens. Marian had been like a sack of meal, a dead weight of plumpness under which he had literally staggered. Izz had ridden sensibly and calmly. Retty was a bunch of hysterics. However, he got through with the disquieted creature, deposited her, and returned. Tess could see over the hedge the distant three in a group, standing as he had placed them on the next rising ground. It was now her turn. She was embarrassed to discover that excitement at the proximity of Mr Clare\u0027s breath and eyes, which she had contemned in her companions, was intensified in herself; and as if fearful of betraying her secret she pattered with him at the last moment. `I may be able to clim\u0027 along the bank perhaps - I can clim\u0027 better than they. You must be so tired, Mr Clare!\u0027 `No, no, Tess,\u0027 said he quickly. And almost before she was aware she was seated in his arms and resting against his shoulder. `Three Leahs to get one Rachel,\u0027 he whispered. `They are better women than I,\u0027 she replied, magnanimously sticking to her resolve. `Not to me,\u0027 said Angel. He saw her grow warm at this; and they went some steps in silence. `I hope I am not too heavy?\u0027 she said timidly. `O no. You should lift Marian! Such a lump. You are like an undulating billow warmed by the sun. And all this fluff of muslin about you is the froth.\u0027 `It is very pretty - if I seem like that to you.\u0027 `Do you know that I have undergone three-quarters of this labour entirely for the sake of the fourth quarter?\u0027 `No.\u0027 `I did not expect such an event to-day.\u0027 `Nor I... The water came up so sudden.\u0027 That the rise in the water was what she understood him to refer to, the state of her breathing belied. Clare stood still and inclined his face towards hers. `O Tessy!\u0027 he exclaimed. The girl\u0027s cheeks burned to the breeze, and she could not look into his eyes for her emotion. It reminded Angel that he was somewhat unfairly taking advantage of an accidental position; and he went no further with it. No definite words of love had crossed their lips as yet, and suspension at this point was desirable now. However, he walked slowly, to make the remainder of the distance as long as possible; but at last they came to the bend, and the rest of their progress was in full view of the other three. The dry land was reached, and he set her down. Her friends were looking with round thoughtful eyes at her and him, and she could see that they had been talking of her. He hastily bade them farewell, and splashed back along the stretch of submerged road. The four moved on together as before, till Marian broke the silence by saying-- `No - in all truth; we have no chance against her!\u0027 She looked joylessly at Tess. `What do you mean?\u0027 asked the latter. `He likes \u0027ee best - the very best! We could see it as he brought \u0027ee. He would have kissed \u0027ee, if you had encouraged him to do it, ever so little.\u0027 `No, no,\u0027 said she. The gaiety with which they had set out had somehow vanished; and yet there was no enmity or malice between them. They were generous young souls; they had been reared in the lonely country nooks where fatalism is a strong sentiment, and they did not blame her. Such supplanting was to be. Tess\u0027s heart ached. There was no concealing from herself the fact that she loved Angel Clare, perhaps all the more passionately from knowing that the others had also lost their hearts to him. There is contagion in this sentiment, especially among women. And yet that same hungry heart of hers compassionated her friends. Tess\u0027s honest nature had fought against this, but too feebly, and the natural result had followed. `I will never stand in your way, nor in the way of either of you!\u0027 she declared to Retty that night in the bedroom (her tears running down). `I can\u0027t help this, my dear! I don\u0027t think marrying is in his mind at all; but if he were even to ask me I should refuse him, as I should refuse any man.\u0027 `Oh! would you? Why?\u0027 said wondering Retty. `It cannot be! But I will be plain. Putting myself quite on one side, I don\u0027t think he will choose either of you.\u0027 `I have never expected it - thought of it!\u0027moaned Retty. `But O! I wish I was dead!\u0027 The poor child, torn by a feeling which she hardly understood, turned to the other two girls who came upstairs just then. `We be friends with her again,\u0027 she said to them. `She thinks no more of his choosing her than we do.\u0027 So the reserve went off, and they were confiding and warm. `I don\u0027t seem to care what I do now,\u0027 said Marian, whose mood was tuned to its lowest bass. `I was going to marry a dairyman at Stickleford, who\u0027s asked me twice; but - my soul - I would put an end to myself rather\u0027n be his wife now! Why don\u0027t ye speak, Izz?\u0027 `To confess, then,\u0027 murmured Izz, `I made sure to-day that he was going to kiss me as he held me; and I lay still against his breast, hoping and hoping, and never moved at all. But he did not. I don\u0027t like biding here at Talbotbays any longer! I shall go hwome.\u0027 The air of the sleeping-chamber seemed to palpitate with the hopeless passion of the girls. They writhed feverishly under the oppressiveness of an emotion thrust on them by cruel Nature\u0027s law - an emotion which they had neither expected nor desired. The incident of the day had fanned the flame that was burning the inside of their hearts out, and the torture was almost more than they could endure. The differences which distinguished them as individuals were abstracted by this passion, and each was but portion of one organism called sex. There was so much frankness and so little jealousy because there was no hope. Each one was a girl of fair common sense, and she did not delude herself with any vain conceits, or deny her love, or give herself airs, in the idea of outshining the others. The full recognition of the futility of their infatuation, from a social point of view; its purposeless beginning; its self-bounded outlook; its lack of everything to justify its existence in the eye of civilization (while lacking nothing in the eye of Nature); the one fact that it did exist, ecstasizing them to a killing joy; all this imparted to them a resignation, a dignity, which a practical and sordid expectation of winning him as a husband would have destroyed. They tossed and turned on their little beds, and the cheese-wring dripped monotonously downstairs. `B\u0027 you awake, Tess?\u0027 whispered one, half-an-hour later. It was Izz Huett\u0027s voice. Tess replied in the affirmative, whereupon also Retty and Marian suddenly flung the bedclothes off them, and sighed-- `So be we!\u0027 `I wonder what she is like - the lady they say his family have looked out for him!\u0027 `I wonder,\u0027 said Izz. `Some lady looked out for him?\u0027 gasped Tess, starting. `I have never heard o\u0027 that!\u0027 `O yes--\u0027tis whispered; a young lady of his own rank, chosen by his family; a Doctor of Divinity\u0027s daughter near his father\u0027s parish of Emminster; he don\u0027t much care for her, they say. But he is sure to marry her.\u0027 They had heard so very little of this; yet it was enough to build up wretched dolorous dreams upon, there in the shade of the night. They pictured all the details of his being won round to consent, of the wedding preparations, of the bride\u0027s happiness, of her dress and veil, of her blissful home with him, when oblivion would have fallen upon themselves as far as he and their love were concerned. Thus they talked, and ached, and wept till sleep charmed their sorrow away.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/80/4718.html","bookId":538,"book":{"id":538,"title":"Tess of the D‘Urbervilles德伯家的苔丝","description":"简介： 《德伯家的苔丝》是哈代的代表作，是威塞克斯系列中的一部。它描写了一位农村姑娘的悲惨命运。哈代在小说的副标题中称女主人公为一个纯洁的女人，公开地向维多利亚时代虚伪的社会道德挑战。女主人公苔丝生于一个贫苦小贩家庭，父母要她到一个富老太婆家去攀亲戚，结果她...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12889203079f0f8.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/80","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
