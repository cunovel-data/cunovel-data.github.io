{"id":10473,"no":1,"title":"Chapter 1","content":"On an evening in the latter part of May a middle-aged man was walking homeward from Shaston to the village of Marlott, in the adjoining Vale of Blakemore or Blackmoor. The pair of legs that carried him were rickety, and there was a bias in his gait which inclined him somewhat to the left of a straight line. He occasionally gave a smart nod, as if in confirmation of some opinion, though he was not thinking of anything in particular. An empty egg-basket was slung upon his arm, the nap of his hat was ruffled, a patch being quite worn away at its brim where his thumb came in taking it off. Presently he was met by an elderly parson astride on a gray mare, who, as he rode, hummed a wandering tune. `Good night t\u0027ee,\u0027 said the man with the basket. \\n\\n `Good night, Sir John,\u0027 said the parson. \\n\\n The pedestrian, after another pace or two, halted, and turned round. \\n\\n `Now, sir, begging your pardon; we met last market-day on this road about this time, and I zaid \"Good-night\", and you made reply \"Good night, Sir John\", as now.\u0027 \\n\\n `I did,\u0027 said the parson. \\n\\n `And once before that - near a month ago.\u0027 \\n\\n `I may have.\u0027 \\n\\n `Then what might your meaning be in calling me \"Sir John\" these different times, when I be plain Jack Durbeyfield, the haggler?\u0027 \\n\\n The parson rode a step or two nearer. \\n\\n `It was only my whim,\u0027 he said; and, after a moment\u0027s hesitation: \u0027It was on account of a discovery I made some little time ago, whilst I was hunting up pedigrees for the new county history. I am Parson Tringham, the antiquary, of Stagfoot Lane. Don\u0027t you really know, Durbeyfield, that you are the lineal representative of the ancient and knightly family of the d\u0027Urbervilles, who derived their descent from Sir Pagan d\u0027Urberville, that renowned knight who came from Normandy with William the Conqueror, as appears by Battle Abbey Roll?\u0027 \\n\\n `Never heard it before, sir!\u0027 \\n\\n `Well it\u0027s true. Throw up your chin a moment, so that I may catch the profile of your face better. Yes, that\u0027s the d\u0027Urberville nose and chin - a little debased. Your ancestor was one of the twelve knights who assisted the Lord of Estremavilla in Normandy in his conquest of Glamorganshire. Branches of your family held manors over all this part of England; their names appear in the Pipe Rolls in the time of King Stephen. In the reign of King John one of them was rich enough to give a manor to the Knights Hospitallers; and in Edward the Second\u0027s time your forefather Brian was summoned to Westminster to attend the great Council there. You declined a little in Oliver Cromwell\u0027s time, but to no serious extent, and in Charles the Second\u0027s reign you were made Knights of the Royal Oak for your loyalty. Aye, there have been generations of Sir Johns among you, and if knighthood were hereditary, like a baronetcy, as it practically was in old times, when men were knighted from father to son, you would be Sir, John now.\u0027 \\n\\n `Ye don\u0027t say so!\u0027 \\n\\n `In short,\u0027 concluded the parson, decisively smacking his leg with his switch, `there\u0027s hardly such another family in England.\u0027 \\n\\n `Daze my eyes, and isn\u0027t there?\u0027 said Durbeyfield. \u0027And here have I been knocking about, year after year, from pillar to post, as if I was no more than the commonest feller in the parish... And how long hev this news about me been knowed, Pa\u0027son Tringham?\u0027 \\n\\n The clergyman explained that, as far as he was aware, it had quite died out of knowledge, and could hardly bc said to be known at all. His own investigations had begun on a day in the preceding spring when, having been engaged in tracing the vicissitudes of the d\u0027Urberville family, he had observed Durbeyfield\u0027s name on his waggon, and had thereupon been led to make inquiries about his father and grandfather till he had no doubt on the subject. \\n\\n `At first I resolved not to disturb you with such a useless piece of information,\u0027 said he. `However, our impulses are too strong for our judgment sometimes. I thought you might perhaps know something of it all the while.\u0027 \\n\\n `Well, I have heard once or twice, `tis true, that my family had seen better days afore they came to Blackmoor. But I took no notice o\u0027t, thinking it to mean that we had once kept two horses where we now keep only one. I\u0027ve got a wold silver spoon, and a wold graven seal at home, too; but, Lord, what\u0027s a spoon and seal?... And to think that I and these noble d\u0027Urbervilles were one flesh all the time. \u0027Twas said that my gr\u0027t-grandfer had secrets, and didn\u0027t care to talk of where he came from... And where do we raise our smoke, now, parson, if I may make so bold; I mean, where do we d\u0027Urbervilles live?\u0027 \\n\\n `You don\u0027t live anywhere. You are extinct - as a county family.\u0027 \\n\\n `That\u0027s bad.\u0027 \\n\\n `Yes - what the mendacious family chronicles call extinct in the male line - that is, gone down - gone under.\u0027 \\n\\n `Then where do we lie?\u0027 \\n\\n `At Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill: rows and rows of you in your vaults, with your effigies under Purbeck-marble canopies.\u0027 \\n\\n `And where be our family mansions and estates?\u0027 \\n\\n `You haven\u0027t any.\u0027 \\n\\n `Oh? No lands neither?\u0027 \\n\\n `None; though you once had \u0027em in abundance, as I said, for your family consisted of numerous branches. In this county there was a seat of yours at Kingsbere, and another at Sherton, and another at Milipond, and another at Lullstead, and another at Wellbridge.\u0027 \\n\\n `And shall we ever come into our own again?\u0027 \\n\\n `Ah - that I can\u0027t tell!\u0027 \\n\\n `And what had I better do about it, sir?\u0027 asked Durbeyfield, after a pause. \\n\\n `Oh - nothing, nothing; except chasten yourself with the thought of \"how are the mighty fallen\". It is a fact of some interest to the local historian and genealogist, nothing more. There are several families among the cottagers of this county of almost equal lustre. Good night.\u0027 \\n\\n `But you\u0027ll turn back and have a quart of beer wi\u0027 me on the strength o\u0027t, Pa\u0027son Tringham? There\u0027s a very pretty brew in tap at The Pure Drop - though, to be sure, not so good as at Rolliver\u0027s.\u0027 \\n\\n `No, thank you - not this evening, Durbeyfield. You\u0027ve had enough already.\u0027 Concluding thus the parson rode on his way, with doubts as to his discretion in retailing this curious bit of lore. \\n\\n When he was gone Durbeyfield walked a few steps in a profound reverie, and then sat down upon the grassy bank by the roadside, depositing his basket before him. In a few minutes a youth appeared in the distance, walking in the same direction as that which had been pursued by Durbeyfield. The latter, on seeing him, held up his hand, and the lad quickened his pace and came near. \\n\\n `Boy, take up that basket! I want\u0027ee to go on an errand for me.\u0027 \\n\\n The lath-like stripling frowned. \u0027Who be you, then, John Durbeyfield, to order me about and call me \"boy\"? You know my name as well as I know yours!\u0027 \\n\\n `Do you, do you? That\u0027s the secret - that\u0027s the secret! Now obey my orders, and take the message I\u0027m going to charge \u0027ee wi\u0027... .Well, Fred, I don\u0027t mind telling you that the secret is that I\u0027m one of a noble race - it has been just found out by me this present afternoon P.M.\u0027 And as he made the announcement, Durbeyfield, declining from his sitting position, luxuriously stretched himself out upon the bank among the daisies. \\n\\n The lad stood before Durbeyfield, and contemplated his length from crown to toe. \\n\\n `Sir John d\u0027Urberville - that\u0027s who I am,\u0027 continued the prostrate man. \u0027That is if knights were baronets - which they be. \u0027Tis recorded in history all about me. Dost know of such a place, lad, as Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill?\u0027 \\n\\n `Ees. I\u0027ve been there to Greenhill Fair.\u0027 \\n\\n `Well, under the church of that city there lie--\u0027 \\n\\n `\u0027Tisn\u0027t a city, the place I mean; leastwise \u0027twaddn\u0027 when I was there--\u0027twas a little one-eyed, blinking sort o\u0027 place.\u0027 \\n\\n `Never you mind the place, boy, that\u0027s not the question before us. Under the church of that there parish lie my ancestors - hundreds of \u0027em - in coats of mail and Jewels, in gr\u0027t lead coffins weighing tons and tons. There\u0027s not a man in the county o\u0027 South-Wessex that\u0027s got grander and nobler skillentons in his family than I.\u0027 \\n\\n `Oh?\u0027 \\n\\n `Now take up that basket, and goo on to Marlott, and when you\u0027ve come to The Pure Drop Inn, tell \u0027em to send a horse and carriage to me immediately, to carry me hwome. And in the bottom o\u0027 the carriage they be to put a noggin o\u0027 rum in a small bottle, and chalk it up to my account. And when you\u0027ve done that goo on to my house with the basket, and tell my wife to put away that washing, because she needn\u0027t finish it, and wait till I come hwome, as I\u0027ve news to tell her.\u0027 \\n\\n As the lad stood in a dubious attitude, Durbeyfield put his hand in his pocket, and produced a shilling, one of the chronically few that he possessed. \\n\\n `Here\u0027s for your labour, lad.\u0027 \\n\\n This made a difference in the young man\u0027s estimate of the position. \\n\\n `Yes, Sir John. Thank \u0027ee. Anything else I can do for \u0027ee, Sir John?\u0027 \\n\\n `Tell \u0027em at hwome that I should like for supper, - well, lamb\u0027s fry if they can get it; and if they can\u0027t, black-pot; and if they can\u0027t get that, well, chitterlings will do.\u0027 \\n\\n `Yes, Sir John.\u0027 \\n\\n The boy took up the basket, and as he set out the notes of a brass band were heard from the direction of the village. \\n\\n `What\u0027s that?\u0027 said Durbeyfield. `Not on account o\u0027 I?\u0027 \\n\\n `\u0027Tis the women\u0027s club-walking, Sir John. Why, your dater is one o\u0027 the members.\u0027 \\n\\n `To be sure - I\u0027d quite forgot it in my thoughts of greater things! Well, vamp on to Marlott, will ye, and order that carriage, and maybe I\u0027ll drive round and inspect the club.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/80/4696.html","bookId":538,"book":{"id":538,"title":"Tess of the D‘Urbervilles德伯家的苔丝","description":"简介： 《德伯家的苔丝》是哈代的代表作，是威塞克斯系列中的一部。它描写了一位农村姑娘的悲惨命运。哈代在小说的副标题中称女主人公为一个纯洁的女人，公开地向维多利亚时代虚伪的社会道德挑战。女主人公苔丝生于一个贫苦小贩家庭，父母要她到一个富老太婆家去攀亲戚，结果她...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12889203079f0f8.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/80","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
