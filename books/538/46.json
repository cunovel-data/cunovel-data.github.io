{"id":10518,"no":46,"title":"Chapter 46","content":"Several days had passed since her futile journey, and Tess was afield. The dry winter wind still blew, but a screen of thatched hurdles erected in the eye of the blast kept its force away from her. On the sheltered side was a turnip-slicing machine, whose bright blue hue of new paint seemed almost vocal in the otherwise subdued scene. Opposite its front was a long mound or `grave\u0027, in which the roots had been preserved since early winter. Tess was standing at the uncovered end, chopping off with a bill-hook the fibres and earth from each root, and throwing it after the operation into the slicer. A man was turning the handle of the machine, and from its trough came the newly-cut swedes, the fresh smell of whose yellow chips was accompanied by the sounds of the snuffling wind, the smart swish of the slicing-blades, and the choppings of the hook in Tess\u0027s leather-gloved hand. The wide acreage of blank agricultural brownness, apparent where the swedes had been pulled, was beginning to be striped in wales of darker brown, gradually broadening to ribands. Along the edge of each of these something crept upon ten legs, moving without haste and without rest up and down the whole length of the field; it was two horses and a man, the plough going between them, turning up the cleared ground for a spring sowing. For hours nothing relieved the joyless monotony of things. Then, far beyond the ploughing-teams, a black speck was seen. It had come from the corner of a fence, where there was a gap, and its tendency was up the incline, towards the swede-cutters. From the proportions of a mere point it advanced to the shape of a ninepin, and was soon perceived to be a man in black, arriving from the direction of Flintcomb-Ash. The man at the slicer, having nothing else to do with his eyes, continually observed the comer, but Tess, who was occupied, did not perceive him till her companion directed her attention to his approach. It was not her hard taskmaster, Farmer Groby; it was one in a semi-clerical costume, who now represented what had once been the free-and-easy Alec d\u0027Urberville. Not being hot at his preaching there was less enthusiasm about him now, and the presence of the grinder seemed to embarrass him. A pale distress was already on Tess\u0027s face, and she pulled her curtained hood further over it. D\u0027Urberville came up and said quietly-- `I want to speak to you, Tess.\u0027 `You have refused my last request, not to come near me!\u0027 said she. `Yes, but I have a good reason.\u0027 `Well, tell it.\u0027 `It is more serious than you may think.\u0027 He glanced round to see if he were overheard. They were at some distance from the man who turned the slicer, and the movement of the machine, too, sufficiently prevented Alec\u0027s words reaching other ears. D\u0027Urberville placed himself so as to screen Tess from the labourer, turning his back to the latter. `It is this,\u0027 he continued, with capricious compunction. `In thinking of your soul and mine when we last met, I neglected to inquire as to your worldly condition. You were well dressed, and I did not think of it. But I see now that it is hard - harder than it used to be when I - knew you - harder than you deserve. Perhaps a good deal of it is owing to me!\u0027 She did not answer, and he watched her inquiringly, as, with bent head, her face completely screened by the hood, she resumed her trimming of the swedes. By going on with her work she felt better able to keep him outside her emotions. `Tess,\u0027 he added, with a sigh of discontent,--\u0027yours was the very worst case I ever was concerned in! I had no idea of what had resulted till you told me. Scamp that I was to foul that innocent life! The whole blame was mine - the whole unconventional business of our time at Trantridge. You, too, the real blood of which I am but the base imitation, what a blind young thing you were as to possibilities! I say in all earnestness that it is a shame for parents to bring up their girls in such dangerous ignorance of the gins and nets that the wicked may set for them, whether their motive be a good one or the result of simple indifference.\u0027 Tess still did no more than listen, throwing down one globular root and taking up another with automatic regularity, the pensive contour of the mere fieldwoman alone marking her. `But it is not that I came to say,\u0027 d\u0027Urberville went on. `My circumstances are these. I have lost my mother since you were at Trantridge, and the place is my own. But I intend to sell it, and devote myself to missionary work in Africa. A devil of a poor hand I shall make at the trade, no doubt. However, what I want to ask you is, will you put it in my power to do my duty - to make the only reparation I can make for the trick played you: that is, will you be my wife, and go with me?... I have already obtained this precious document. It was my old mother\u0027s dying wish.\u0027 He drew a piece of parchment from his pocket, with a slight fumbling of embarrassment. `What is it?\u0027 said she. `A marriage licence.\u0027 `O no, sir - no!\u0027 she said quickly, starting back. `You will not? Why is that?\u0027 And as he asked the question a disappointment which was not entirely the disappointment of thwarted duty crossed d\u0027Urberville face. It was unmistakably a symptom that something of his old passion for her had been revived; duty and desire ran hand-in-hand. `Surely,\u0027 he began again, in more impetuous tones, and then looked round at the labourer who turned the slicer. Tess, too, felt that the argument could not be ended there. Informing the man that a gentleman had come to see her, with whom she wished to walk a little way, she moved off with d\u0027Urberville across the zebra-striped field. When they reached the first newly-sloughed section he held out his hand to help her over it; but she stepped forward on the summits of the earth-rolls as if she did not see him. `You will not marry me, Tess, and make me a self-respecting man?\u0027 he repeated, as soon as they were over the furrows. `I cannot.\u0027 `But why?\u0027 `You know I have no affection for you.\u0027 `But you would get to feel that in time, perhaps - as soon as you really could forgive me?\u0027 `Never!\u0027 `Why so positive?\u0027 `I love somebody else.\u0027 The words seemed to astonish him. `You do?\u0027 he cried. `Somebody else? But has not a sense of what is morally right and proper any weight with you?\u0027 `No, no, no - don\u0027t say that!\u0027 `Anyhow, then, your love for this other man may be only a passing feeling which you will overcome------\u0027 `No - no.\u0027 `Yes, yes! Why not?\u0027 `I cannot tell you.\u0027 `You must in honour!\u0027 `Well then - I have married him.\u0027 `Ah!\u0027 he exclaimed; and he stopped dead and gazed at her. `I did not wish to tell - I did not mean to!\u0027 she pleaded. `It is a secret here, or at any rate but dimly known. So will you, please will you, keep from questioning me? You must remember that we are now strangers.\u0027 `Strangers - are we? Strangers!\u0027 For a moment a flash of his old irony marked his face; but he determinedly chastened it down. `Is that man your husband?\u0027 he asked mechanically, denoting by a sign the labourer who turned the machine. `That man!\u0027 she said proudly. `I should think not!\u0027 `Who, then?\u0027 `Do not ask what I do not wish to tell!\u0027 she begged, and flashed her appeal to him from her upturned face and lash-shadowed eyes. D\u0027Urberville was disturbed. `But I only asked for your sake!\u0027 he retorted hotly. `Angels of heaven! - God forgive me for such an expression - I came here, I swear, as I thought for your good. Tess - don\u0027t look at me so - I cannot stand your looks! There never were such eyes, surely, before Christianity or since! There - I won\u0027t lose my head; I dare not. I own that the sight of you has waked up my love for You, which, I believed, was extinguished with all such feelings. But I thought that our marriage might be a sanctification for us both. \"The unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband,\" I said to myself. But my plan is dashed from me; and I must bear the disappointment!\u0027 He moodily reflected with his eyes on the ground. `Married. Married! - Well, that being so,\u0027 he added, quite calmly, tearing the licence slowly into halves and putting them in his pocket; `that being prevented, I should like to do some good to you and your husband, whoever he may be. There are many questions that I am tempted to ask, but I will not do so, of course, in opposition to your wishes. Though, if I could know your husband, I might more easily benefit him and you. Is he on this farm?\u0027 `No,\u0027 she murmured. `He is far away.\u0027 `Far away? From you? What sort of husband can he be?\u0027 `O, do not speak against him! It was through you! He found out------\u0027 `Ah, is it so! - . That\u0027s sad, Tess!\u0027 `Yes.\u0027 `But to stay away from you - to leave you to work like this!\u0027 `He does not leave me to work!\u0027 she cried, springing to the defence of the absent one with all her fervour. `He don\u0027t know it! It is by my own arrangement.\u0027 `Then, does he write?\u0027 `I - I cannot tell you. There are things which are private to ourselves.\u0027 `Of course that means that he does not. You are a deserted wife, my fair Tess!\u0027 In an impulse he turned suddenly to take her hand; the buff-glove was on it, and he seized only the rough leather fingers which did not express the life or shape of those within. `You must not - you must not!\u0027 she cried fearfully, slipping her hand from the glove as from a pocket, and leaving it in his grasp. `O, will you go away - for the sake of me and my husband - go, in the name of your own Christianity!\u0027 `Yes, yes; I will,\u0027 he said abruptly, and thrusting the glove back to her turned to leave. Facing round, however, he said, `Tess, as God is my judge, I meant no humbug in taking your hand!\u0027 A pattering of hoofs on the soil of the field, which they had not noticed in their preoccupation, ceased close behind them; and a voice reached her ear: `What the devil are you doing away from your work at this time o\u0027 day?\u0027 Farmer Groby had espied the two figures from the distance, and had inquisitively ridden across, to learn what was their business in his field. `Don\u0027t speak like that to her!\u0027 said d\u0027Urberville, his face blackening with something that was not Christianity. `Indeed, Mister! And what mid Methodist parsons have to do with she?\u0027 `Who is the fellow?\u0027 asked d\u0027Urberville, turning to Tess. She went close up to him. `Go - I do beg you!\u0027 she said. `What! And leave you to that tyrant? I can see in his face what a churl he is.\u0027 `He won\u0027t hurt me. He\u0027s not in love with me. I can leave at Lady-Day.\u0027 `Well, I have no right but to obey, I suppose. But - well, good-bye!\u0027 Her defender, whom she dreaded more than her assailant, having reluctantly disappeared, the farmer continued his reprimand, which Tess took with the greatest coolness, that sort of attack being independent of sex. To have as a master this man of stone, who would have cuffed her if he had dared, was almost a relief after her former experiences. She silently walked back towards the summit of the field that was the scene of her labour, so absorbed in the interview which had Just taken place that she was hardly aware that the nose of Groby\u0027s horse almost touched her shoulders. `If so be you make an agreement to work for me till Lady-Day, I\u0027ll see that you carry it out,\u0027 he growled. `\u0027Od rot the women - now \u0027tis one thing, and then \u0027tis another. But I\u0027ll put up with it no longer!\u0027 Knowing very well that he did not harass the other women of the farm as he harassed her out of spite for the flooring he had once received, she did for one moment picture what might have been the result if she had been free to accept the offer just made her of being the monied Alec\u0027s wife. It would have lifted her completely out of subjection, not only to her present oppressive employer, but to a whole world who seemed to despise her. `But no, no!\u0027 she said breathlessly; `I could not have married him now! He is so unpleasant to me.\u0027 That very night she began an appealing letter to Clare, concealing from him her hardships, and assuring him of her undying affection. Any one who had been in a position to read between the lines would have seen that at the back of her great love was some monstrous fear - almost a desperation - as to some secret contingencies which were not disclosed. But again she did not finish her effusion; he had asked Izz to go with him, and perhaps he did not care for her at all. She put the letter in her box, and wondered if it would ever reach Angel\u0027s hands. After this her dally tasks were gone through heavily enough, and brought on the day which was of great import to agriculturists - the day of the Candlemas Fair. It was at this fair that new engagements were entered into for the twelve months following the ensuing Lady-Day, and those of the farming population who thought of changing their places duly attended at the county-town where the fair was held. Nearly all the labourers on Flintcomb-Ash Farm intended flight, and early in the morning there was a general exodus in the direction of the town, which lay at a distance of from ten to a dozen miles over hilly country. Though Tess also meant to leave at the quarter-day she was one of the few who did not go to the fair, having a vaguely-shaped hope that something would happen to render another outdoor engagement unnecessary. It was a peaceful February day, of wonderful softness for the time, and one would almost have thought that winter was over. She had hardly finished her dinner when d\u0027Urberville\u0027s figure darkened the window of the cottage wherein she was a lodger, which she had all to herself to-day. Tess jumped up, but her visitor had knocked at the door, and she could hardly in reason run away. D\u0027Urberville\u0027s knock, his walk up to the door, had some indescribable quality of difference from his air when she last saw him. They seemed to be acts of which the doer was ashamed. She thought that she would not open the door; but, as there was no sense in that either, she arose, and having lifted the latch stepped back quickly. He came in, saw her, and flung himself down into a chair before speaking. `Tess - I couldn\u0027t help it!\u0027 he began desperately, as he wiped his heated face, which had also a superimposed flush of excitement. `I felt that I must call at least to ask how you are. I assure you I had not been thinking of you at all till I saw you that Sunday; now I cannot get rid of your image, try how I may! It is hard that a good woman should do harm to a bad man; yet so it is. If you would only pray for me, Tess!\u0027 The suppressed discontent of his manner was almost pitiable, and yet Tess did not pity him. `How can I pray for you,\u0027 she said, `when I am forbidden to believe that the great Power who moves the world would alter His plans on my account?\u0027 `You really think that?\u0027 `Yes. I have been cured of the presumption of thinking otherwise.\u0027 `Cured? By whom?\u0027 `By my husband, if I must tell.\u0027 `Ah - your husband - your husband! How strange it seems! I remember you hinted something of the sort the other day. What do you really believe in these matters, Tess?\u0027 he asked. `You seem to have no religion - perhaps owing to me.\u0027 `But I have. Though I don\u0027t believe in anything supernatural.\u0027 D\u0027Urberville looked at her with misgiving. `Then do you think that the line I take is all wrong?\u0027 `A good deal of it.\u0027 `H\u0027m - and yet I\u0027ve felt so sure about it,\u0027 he said uneasily. `I believe in the spirit of the Sermon on the Mount, and so did my dear husband... . But I don\u0027t believe------\u0027 Here she gave her negations. `The fact is,\u0027 said d\u0027Urberville drily, `whatever your dear husband believed you accept, and whatever he rejected you reject, without the least inquiry or reasoning on your own part. That\u0027s just like you women. Your mind is enslaved to his.\u0027 `Ah, because he knew everything!\u0027 said she, with a triumphant simplicity of faith in Angel Clare that the most perfect man could hardly have deserved, much less her husband. `Yes, but you should not take negative opinions wholesale from another person like that. A pretty fellow he must be to teach you such scepticism!\u0027 `He never forced my judgment! He would never argue on the subject with me! But I looked at it in this way; what he believed, after inquiring deep into doctrines, was much more likely to be right than what I might believe, who hadn\u0027t looked into doctrines at all.\u0027 `What used he to say? He must have said something?\u0027 She reflected; and with her acute memory for the letter of Angel Clare\u0027s remarks, even when she did not comprehend their spirit, she recalled a merciless polemical syllogism that she had heard him use when, as it occasionally happened, he indulged in a species of thinking aloud with her at his side. In delivering it she gave also Clare\u0027s accent and manner with reverential faithfulness. `Say that again,\u0027 asked d\u0027Urberville, who had listened with the greatest attention. She repeated the argument, and d\u0027Urberville thoughtfully murmured the words after her. `Anything else?\u0027 he presently asked. `He said at another time something like this\u0027; and she gave another, which might possibly have been paralleled in many a work of the pedigree ranging from the Dictionnaire Philosophique to Huxley\u0027s Essays. `Ah - ha! How do you remember them?\u0027 `I wanted to believe what he believed, though he didn\u0027t wish me to; and I managed to coax him to tell me a few of his thoughts. I can\u0027t say I quite understand that one; but I know it is right.\u0027 `H\u0027m. Fancy your being able to teach me what you don\u0027t know yourself!\u0027 He fell into thought. `And so I threw in my spiritual lot with his,\u0027 she resumed. `I didn\u0027t wish it to be different. What\u0027s good enough for him is good enough for me.\u0027 `Does he know that you are as big an infidel as he?\u0027 `No - I never told him - if I am an infidel.\u0027 `Well - you are better off to-day than I am, Tess, after all! You don\u0027t believe that you ought to preach my doctrine, and, therefore, do no despite to your conscience in abstaining. I do believe I ought to preach it, but like the devils I believe and tremble, for I suddenly leave off preaching it, and give way to my passion for you.\u0027 `How?\u0027 `Why,\u0027 he said aridly; `I have come all the way here to see you to-day! But I started from home to go to Casterbridge Fair, where I have undertaken to preach the Word from a waggon at half-past two this afternoon, and where all the brethren are expecting me this minute. Here\u0027s the announcement.\u0027 He drew from his breast-pocket a poster whereon was printed the day, hour, and place of meeting, at which he, d\u0027Urberville, would preach the Gospel as aforesaid. `But how can you get there?\u0027 said Tess, looking at the clock. `I cannot get there! I have come here.\u0027 `What, you have really arranged to preach, and------\u0027 `I have arranged to preach, and I shall not be there - by reason of my burning desire to see a woman whom I once despised! - No, by my word and truth, I never despised you; if I had I should not love you now! Why I did not despise you was on account of your being unsmirched in spite of all; you withdrew yourself from me so quickly and resolutely when you saw the situation; you did not remain at my pleasure; so there was one petticoat in the world for whom I had no contempt, and you are she. But you may well despise me now! I thought I worshipped on the mountains, but I find I still serve in the groves! Ha! ha!\u0027 `O Alec d\u0027Urberville! What does this mean? What have I done!\u0027 `Done?\u0027 he said, with a soulless sneer in the word. `Nothing intentionally. But you have been the means - the innocent means - of my backsliding, as they call it. I ask myself, am I, indeed, one of those \"servants of corruption\" who, \"after they have escaped the pollutions of the world, are again entangled therein and overcome\" - whose latter end is worse than their beginning?\u0027 He laid his hand on her shoulder. `Tess, my girl, I was on the way to, at least, social salvation till I saw you again!\u0027 he said freakishly shaking her, as if she were a child. `And why then have you tempted me? I was firm as a man could be till I saw those eyes and that mouth again - surely there never was such a maddening mouth since Eve\u0027s!\u0027 His voice sank, and a hot archness shot from his own black eyes. `You temptress, Tess; you dear damned witch of Babylon, - I could not resist you as soon as I met you again!\u0027 I couldn\u0027t help your seeing me again!\u0027 said Tess, recoiling. `I know it - I repeat that I do not blame you. But the fact remains. When I saw you ill-used on the farm that day I was nearly mad to think that I had no legal right to protect you - that I could not have it; whilst he who has it seems to neglect you utterly!\u0027 `Don\u0027t speak against him - he is absent!\u0027 she cried in much excitement. `Treat him honourably - he has never wronged you! O leave his wife before any scandal spreads that may do harm to bis honest name!\u0027 `I will - I will,\u0027 he said, like a man awakening from a luring dream. `I have broken my engagement to preach to those poor drunken boobies at the fair - it is the first time I have played such a practical joke. A month ago I should have been horrified at such a possibility. I\u0027ll go away - to swear - and - ah, can I! to keep away.\u0027 Then, suddenly: `One clasp, Tessy - one! Only for old friendship------\u0027 `I am without defence, Alec! A good man\u0027s honour is in my keeping - think - be ashamed!\u0027 `Pooh! Well yes - yes!\u0027 He clenched his lips, mortified with himself for his weakness. His eyes were equally barren of worldly and religious faith. The corpses of those old fitful passions which had lain inanimate amid the lines of his face ever since his reformation seemed to wake and come together as in a resurrection. He went out indeterminately. Though d\u0027Urberville had declared that this breach of his engagement to-day was the simple backsliding of a believer, Tess\u0027s words, as echoed from Angel Clare, had made a deep impression upon him, and continued to do so after he had left her. He moved on in silence, as if his energies were benumbed by the hitherto undreamt-of possibility that his position was untenable. Reason had had nothing to do with his whimsical conversion, which was perhaps the mere freak of a careless man in search of a new sensation, and temporarily impressed by his mother\u0027s death.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/80/4741.html","bookId":538,"book":{"id":538,"title":"Tess of the D‘Urbervilles德伯家的苔丝","description":"简介： 《德伯家的苔丝》是哈代的代表作，是威塞克斯系列中的一部。它描写了一位农村姑娘的悲惨命运。哈代在小说的副标题中称女主人公为一个纯洁的女人，公开地向维多利亚时代虚伪的社会道德挑战。女主人公苔丝生于一个贫苦小贩家庭，父母要她到一个富老太婆家去攀亲戚，结果她...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12889203079f0f8.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/80","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
