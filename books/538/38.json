{"id":10510,"no":38,"title":"Chapter 38","content":"As she drove on through Blackmoor Vale, and the landscape of her youth began to open around her, Tess aroused herself from her stupor. Her first thought was how would she be able to face her parents? She reached a turnpike-gate which stood upon the highway to the village. It was thrown open by a stranger, not by the old man who had kept it for many years, and to whom she had been known; he had probably left on New Year\u0027s Day, the date when such changes were made. Having received no intelligence lately from her home, she asked the turnpike-keeper for news. `Oh - nothing, miss,\u0027 he answered. Marlott is Marlott still. Folks have died and that. John Durbeyfield, too, hev had a daughter married this week to a gentleman-farmer; not from John\u0027s own house, you know; they was married elsewhere; the gentleman being of that high standing that John\u0027s own folk was not considered well-be-doing enough to have any part in it, the bridegroom seeming not to know how\u0027t have been discovered that John is a old and ancient nobleman himself by blood, with family skillentons in their own vaults to this day, but done out of his property in the time o\u0027 the Romans. However, Sir John, as we call \u0027n now, kept up the wedding-day as well as he could, and stood treat to everybody in the parish; and John\u0027s wife sung songs at the Pure Drop till past eleven o\u0027clock.\u0027 Hearing this, Tess felt so sick at heart that she could not decide to go home publicly in the fly with her luggage and belongings. She asked the turnpike-keeper if she might deposit her things at his house for a while, and, on his offering no objection, she dismissed her carriage, and went on to the village alone by a back lane. At sight of her father\u0027s chimney she asked herself how she could possibly enter the house? Inside that cottage her relations were calmly supposing her far away on a wedding-tour with a comparatively rich man, who was to conduct her to bouncing prosperity; while here she was, friendless, creeping up to the old door quite by herself, with no better place to go to in the world. She did not reach the house unobserved. just by the garden hedge she was met by a girl who knew her - one of the two or three with whom she had been intimate at school. After making a few inquiries as to how Tess came there, her friend, unheeding her tragic look, interrupted with-- `But where\u0027s thy gentleman, Tess?\u0027 Tess hastily explained that he had been called away on business, and, leaving her interlocutor, clambered over the garden-hedge, and thus made her way to the house. As she went up the garden-path she heard her mother singing by the back door, coming in sight of which she perceived Mrs Durbeyfield on the doorstep in the act of wringing a sheet. Having performed this without observing Tess, she went indoors, and her daughter followed her. The washing-tub stood in the same old place on the same old quarter-hogshead, and her mother, having thrown the sheet aside, was about to plunge her arms in anew. `Why - Tess! - my chil\u0027 - I thought you was married! - married really and truly this time - we sent the cider--\u0027 `Yes, mother; so I am.\u0027 `Going to be?\u0027 `No - I am married.\u0027 `Married! Then where\u0027s thy husband?\u0027 `Oh, he\u0027s gone away for a time.\u0027 `Gone away! When was you married, then? The day you said?\u0027 `Yes, Tuesday, mother.\u0027 `And now \u0027tis on\u0027y Saturday, and he gone away?\u0027 `Yes; he\u0027s gone.\u0027 `What\u0027s the meaning o\u0027 that? `Nation seize such husbands as you seem to get, say I!\u0027 `Mother!\u0027 Tess went across to Joan Durbeyfield, laid her face upon the matron\u0027s bosom, and burst into sobs. `I don\u0027t know how to tell \u0027ee, mother! You said to me, and wrote to me, that I was not to tell him. But I did tell him - I couldn\u0027t help it - and he went away!\u0027 `O you little fool - you little fool!\u0027 burst out Mrs Durbeyfield, splashing Tess and herself in her agitation. `My good God! that ever I should ha\u0027 lived to say it, but I say it again, you little fool!\u0027 Tess was convulsed with weeping, the tension of so many days having relaxed at last. `I know it - I know - I know!\u0027 she gasped through her sobs. `But, O my mother, I could not help it! He was so good - and I felt the wickedness of trying to blind him as to what had happened! If - if - it were to be done again - I should do the same. I could not - I dared not - so sin - against him!\u0027 `But you sinned enough to marry him first!\u0027 `Yes, yes; that\u0027s where my misery do lie! But I thought he could get rid o\u0027 me by law if he were determined not to overlook it. And O, if you knew - if you could only half know how I loved him how anxious I was to have him - and how wrung I was between caring so much for him and my wish to be fair to him!\u0027 Tess was so shaken that she could get no further, and sank a helpless thing into a chair. `Well, well; what\u0027s done can\u0027t be undone! I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t know why children o\u0027 my bringing forth should all be bigger simpletons than other people\u0027s - not to know better than to blab such a thing as that, when he couldn\u0027t ha\u0027 found it out till too late!\u0027 Here Mrs Durbeyfield began shedding tears on her own account as a mother to be pitied. `What your father will say I don\u0027t know,\u0027 she continued: `for he\u0027s been talking about the wedding up at Roliver\u0027s and The Pure Drop every day since, and about his family getting back to their rightful position through you - poor silly man! - and now you\u0027ve made this mess of it! The Lord-a-Lord!\u0027 As if to bring matters to a focus, Tess\u0027s father was heard approaching at that moment. He did not however, enter immediately, and Mrs Durbeyfield said that she would break the bad news to him herself, Tess keeping out of sight for the present. After her first burst of disappointment Joan began to take the mishap as she had taken Tess\u0027s original trouble, as she would have taken a wet holiday or failure in the potato-crop; as a thing which had come upon them irrespective of desert or folly; a chance external impingement to be borne with; not a lesson. Tess retreated upstairs, and beheld casually that the beds had been shifted, and new arrangements made. Her old bed had been adapted for two younger children. There was no place here for her now. The room below being unceiled she could hear most of what went on there. Presently her father entered, apparently carrying a live hen. He was a foot-haggler now, having been obliged to sell his second horse, and he travelled with his basket on his arm. The hen had been carried about this morning as it was often carried, to show people that he was in his work, though it had lain, with its legs tied, under the table at Rolliver\u0027s for more than an hour. `We\u0027ve just had up a story about--\u0027 Durbeyfield began, and thereupon related in detail to his wife a discussion which had arisen at the inn about the clergy, originated by the fact of his daughter having married into a clerical family. `They was formerly styled \"sir\", like my own ancestry,\u0027 he said, `though nowadays their true style, strictly speaking, is \"clerk\" only.\u0027 As Tess had wished that no great publicity should be given to the event, he had mentioned no particulars. He hoped she would remove that prohibition soon. He proposed that the couple should take Tess\u0027s own name, d\u0027Urberville, as uncorrupted. It was better than her husband\u0027s. He asked if any letter had come from her that day. Then Mrs Durbeyfield informed him that no letter had come, but Tess unfortunately had come herself. When at length the collapse was explained to him a sullen mortification, not usual with Durbeyfield, overpowered the influence of the cheering glass. Yet the intrinsic quality of the event moved his touchy sensitiveness less than its conjectured effect upon the minds of others. `To think, now, that this was to be the end o\u0027t!\u0027 said Sir John. `And I with a family vault under that there church of Kingsbere as big as Squire Jollard\u0027s ale-cellar, and my folk lying there in sixes and sevens, as genuine county bones and marrow as any recorded in history. And now to be sure what they fellers at Rolliver\u0027s and The Pure Drop will say to me! How they\u0027ll squint and glane, and say, \"This is yer mighty match is it; this is yer getting back to the true level of yer forefathers in King Norman\u0027s time!\" I feel this is too much, Joan; I shall put an end to myself, title and all - I can bear it no longer!... . But she can make him keep her if he\u0027s married her?\u0027 `Why, yes. But she won\u0027t think o\u0027 doing that.\u0027 `D\u0027ye think he really have married her? - or is it like the first--\u0027 Poor Tess, who had heard as far as this, could not bear to hear more. The perception that her word could be doubted even here, in her own parental house, set her mind against the spot as nothing else could have done. How unexpected were the attacks of destiny! And if her father doubted her a little, would not neighbours and acquaintance doubt her much? O, she could not live long at home!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/80/4733.html","bookId":538,"book":{"id":538,"title":"Tess of the D‘Urbervilles德伯家的苔丝","description":"简介： 《德伯家的苔丝》是哈代的代表作，是威塞克斯系列中的一部。它描写了一位农村姑娘的悲惨命运。哈代在小说的副标题中称女主人公为一个纯洁的女人，公开地向维多利亚时代虚伪的社会道德挑战。女主人公苔丝生于一个贫苦小贩家庭，父母要她到一个富老太婆家去攀亲戚，结果她...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12889203079f0f8.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/80","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
