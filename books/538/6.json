She did not know what the other occupants said to her as she entered, though she answered them; and when they had started anew she rode along with an inward and not an outward eye. \n One among her fellow-travellers addressed her more pointedly than any had spoken before: `Why, you be quite a posy! And such roses in early June!\u0027 \n Then she became aware of the spectacle she presented to their surprised vision: roses at her breast; roses in her hat; roses and strawberries in her basket to the brim. She blushed, and said confusedly that the flowers had been given to her. When the passengers were not looking she stealthily removed the more prominent blooms from her hat and placed them in the basket, where she covered them with her handkerchief. Then she fell to reflecting again, and in looking downwards a thorn of the rose remaining in her breast accidentally pricked her chin. Like all the cottagers in Blackmoor Vale, Tess was steeped in fancies and prefigurative superstitions; she thought this an ill omen - the first she had noticed that day. \n The van travelled only so far as Shaston, and there were several miles of pedestrian descent from that mountain town into the vale to Marlott. Her mother had advised her to stay here for the night, at the house of a cottage woman they knew, If she should feel too tired to come on; and this Tess did, not descending to her home till the following afternoon. \n When she entered the house she perceived in a moment from her mother\u0027s triumphant manner that something had occurred in the interim. \n `Oh yes; I know all about it! I told \u0027ee it would be all right, and now \u0027tis proved!\u0027 \n `Since I\u0027ve been away? What has?\u0027 said Tess rather wearily. \n Her mother surveyed the girl up and down with arch approval, and went on banteringly: `So you\u0027ve brought \u0027em round!\u0027 \n `How do you know, mother,\u0027 \n `I\u0027ve had a letter.\u0027 \n Tess then remembered that there would have been time for this. \n `They say - Mrs d\u0027Urberville says - that she wants you to look after a little fowl-farm which is her hobby. But this is only her artful way of getting \u0027ee there without raising your hopes. She\u0027s going to own \u0027ee as kin - that\u0027s the meaning o\u0027.\u0027 \n `But I didn\u0027t see her.\u0027 \n `You zid somebody, I suppose?\u0027 \n `I saw her son.\u0027 \n `And did he own \u0027ee?\u0027 \n `Well - he called me Coz.\u0027 \n `An\u0027 I knew it! Jacky he called her Coz!\u0027 cried Joan to her husband. `Well, he spoke to his mother, of course, and she do want \u0027ee there.\u0027 \n `But I don\u0027t know that I am apt at tending fowls,\u0027 said the dubious Tess. \n `Then I don\u0027t know who is apt. You\u0027ve been born in the business, and brought up in it. They that be born in a business always know more about it than any \u0027prentice. Besides, that\u0027s only just a show of something for you to do, that you midn\u0027t feel beholden.\u0027 \n `I don\u0027t altogether think I ought to go,\u0027 said Tess thoughtfully. \n `Who wrote the letter? Will you let me look at it?\u0027 \n `Mrs d\u0027Urberville wrote it. Here it is.\u0027 \n The letter was in the third person, and briefly informed Mrs Durbeyfield that her daughter\u0027s services would be useful to that lady in the management of her poultry farm, that a comfortable room would be provided for her if she could come, and that the wages would be on a liberal scale if they liked her. \n `Oh - that\u0027s all!\u0027 said Tess. \n `You couldn\u0027t expect her to throw her arms round \u0027ee, an\u0027 to kiss and to coll \u0027ee all at once.\u0027 \n Tess looked out of the window. \n `I would rather stay here with father and you,\u0027 she said. \n `But why?\u0027 \n `I\u0027d rather not tell you why, mother; indeed, I don\u0027t quite know why.\u0027 \n A week afterwards she came in one evening from an unavailing search for some light occupation in the immediate neighbourhood. Her idea had been to get together sufficient money during the summer to purchase another horse. Hardly had she crossed the threshold before one of the children danced across the room, `The gentleman\u0027s been here!\u0027 saying, \n Her mother hastened to explain, smiles breaking from every inch of her person. Mrs d\u0027Urberville\u0027s son had called on horseback, having been riding by chance in the direction of Marlott. He had wished to know, finally, in the name of his mother, if Tess could really come to manage the old lady\u0027s fowl farm or not; the lad who had hitherto superintended the birds having proved untrustworthy. `Mr d\u0027Urberville says you must be a good girl if you are at all as you appear; he knows you must be worth your weight in gold. He is very much interested in \u0027ee - truth to tell.\u0027 Tess seemed for the moment really pleased to hear that she had won such high opinion from a stranger when, in her own esteem, she had sunk so low. \n `It is very good of him to think that,\u0027 she murmured; `and if I was quite sure how it would be living there, I would go any-when.\u0027 \n `He is a mighty handsome man!\u0027 \n `I don\u0027t think so,\u0027 said Tess coldly. \n `Well, there\u0027s your chance, whether or no; and I\u0027m sure he wears a beautiful diamond ring!\u0027 \n `Yes,\u0027 said little Abraham, brightly, from the window bench; `and I seed it! and it did twinkle when he put his hand up to his mistarshers. Mother, why did our grand relation keep on putting his hand up to his mistarshers?\u0027 \n `Hark at that child!\u0027 cried Mrs Durbeyfield, with parenthetic admiration. \n `Perhaps to show his diamond ring,\u0027 murmured Sir John, dreamily, from his chair. \n `I\u0027ll think it over,\u0027 said Tess, leaving the room. \n `Well, she\u0027s made a conquest o\u0027 the younger branch of us, straight off,\u0027 continued the matron to her husband, `and she\u0027s a fool if she don\u0027t follow it up.\u0027 \n `I don\u0027t quite like my children going away from home,\u0027 said the haggler. `As the head of the family, the rest ought to come to me.\u0027 \n `But do let her go, Jacky,\u0027 coaxed his poor witless wife. `He\u0027s struck wi\u0027 - her you can see that. He called her Coz! He\u0027ll marry her, most likely, and make a lady of her; and then she\u0027ll be what her forefathers was.\u0027 \n John Durbeyfield had more conceit than energy or health, and this supposition was pleasant to him. \n `Well, perhaps, that\u0027s what young Mr d\u0027Urberville means,\u0027 he admitted; `and sure enough he mid have serious thoughts about improving his blood by linking on to the old line. Tess, the little rogue! And have she really paid \u0027em a visit to such an end as this?\u0027 Meanwhile Tess was walking thoughtfully among the gooseberry bushes in the garden, and over Prince\u0027s grave. When she came in her mother pursued her advantage. \n `Well, what be you going to do?\u0027 she asked. \n `I wish I had seen Mrs d\u0027Urberville,\u0027 said Tess. \n `I think you mid as well settle it. Then you\u0027ll see her soon enough.\u0027 \n Her father coughed in his chair. \n `I don\u0027t know what to say!\u0027 answered the girl restlessly. `It is for you to decide. I killed the old horse, and I suppose I ought to do something to get ye a new one. But - but - I don\u0027t quite like Mr d\u0027Urberville being there!\u0027 \n The children, who had made use of this idea of Tess being taken up by their wealthy kinsfolk (which they imagined the other family to be) as a species of dolorifuge after the death of the horse, began to cry at Tess\u0027s reluctance, and teased and reproached her for hesitating. \n `Tess won\u0027t go-o-o and be made a la-a-dy-of - !no, she says she won\u0027t!\u0027 they walled with square mouths. `And we shan\u0027t have a nice new horse, and lots o\u0027 golden money to buy fairlings! And Tess won\u0027t look pretty in her best cloze no mo-o-ore!\u0027 \n Her mother chimed in to the same tune: a certain way she had of making her labours in the house seem heavier than they were by prolonging them indefinitely, also weighed in the argument. Her father alone preserved an attitude of neutrality. \n `I will go,\u0027 said Tess at last. \n Her mother could not repress her consciousness of the nuptial Vision conjured up by the girl\u0027s consent. \n `That\u0027s right! For such a pretty maid as \u0027tis, this is a fine chance!\u0027 \n Tess smiled crossly. \n `I hope it is a chance for earning money. It is no other kind of chance. You had better say nothing of that silly sort about parish.\u0027 \n Mrs Durbeyfield did not promise. She was not quite sure that she did not feel proud enough, after the visitor\u0027s remarks, to say a good deal. \n Thus it was arranged; and the young girl wrote, agreeing to be ready to set out on any day on which she might be required. She was duly informed that Mrs d\u0027Urberville was glad of her decision, and that a spring-cart should be sent to meet her and her luggage at the top of the Vale on the day after the morrow, when she must hold herself prepared to start. Mrs d\u0027Urberville\u0027s handwriting seemed rather masculine. \n `A cart?\u0027 murmured Joan Durbeyfield doubtingly. `It might have been a carriage for her own kin!\u0027 \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/80/4701.html","bookId":538,"book":{"id":538,"title":"Tess of the D‘Urbervilles德伯家的苔丝","description":"简介： 《德伯家的苔丝》是哈代的代表作，是威塞克斯系列中的一部。它描写了一位农村姑娘的悲惨命运。哈代在小说的副标题中称女主人公为一个纯洁的女人，公开地向维多利亚时代虚伪的社会道德挑战。女主人公苔丝生于一个贫苦小贩家庭，父母要她到一个富老太婆家去攀亲戚，结果她...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12889203079f0f8.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/80","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
