{"id":10489,"no":17,"title":"Chapter 17","content":"`Oh - ay, as a lad I knowed your part o\u0027 the country very well,\u0027 he said terminatively. `Though I\u0027ve never been there since. And a aged woman of ninety that used to live nigh here, but is dead and gone long ago, told me that a family of some such name as yours in Blackmoor Vale came originally from these parts, and that \u0027twere a old ancient race that had all but perished off the earth - though the new generations didn\u0027t know it. But, Lord, I took no notice of the old woman\u0027s ramblings, not I.\u0027 \\n\\n `Oh no - it is nothing,\u0027 said Tess. \\n\\n Then the talk was of business only. \\n\\n `You can milk \u0027em clean, my maidy? I don\u0027t want my cows going azew at this time o\u0027 year.\u0027 \\n\\n She reassured him on that point, and he surveyed her up and down. She had been staying indoors a good deal, and her complexion had grown delicate. \\n\\n `Quite sure you can stand it? \u0027Tis comfortable enough here for rough folk; but we don\u0027t live in a cowcumber frame.\u0027 \\n\\n She declared that she could stand it, and her zest and willingness seemed to win him over. \\n\\n `Well, I suppose you\u0027ll want a dish o\u0027 tay, or victuals of some sort, hey? Not yet? Well, do as ye like about it. But faith, if \u0027twas I, I should be as dry as a kex wi\u0027 travelling so far.\u0027 \\n\\n `I\u0027ll begin milking now, to get my hand in,\u0027 said Tess. \\n\\n She drank a little milk as temporary refreshment - to the surprise - indeed, slight contempt - of Dairyman Crick, to whose mind it had apparently never occurred that milk was good as a beverage. \\n\\n `Oh, if ye can swaller that, be it so,\u0027 he said indifferently, while one held up the pall that she sipped from. `\u0027Tis what I hain\u0027t touched for years - not I. Rot the stuff; it would lie in my innerds like lead. You can try your hand upon she,\u0027 he pursued, nodding to the nearest cow. `Not but what she do milk rather hard. We\u0027ve hard ones and we\u0027ve easy ones, like other folks. However, you\u0027ll find out that soon enough.\u0027 \\n\\n When Tess had changed her bonnet for a hood, and was really on her stool under the cow, and the milk was squirting from her fists into the pall, she appeared to feel that she really had laid a new foundation for her future. The conviction bred serenity, her pulse slowed, and she was able to look about her. \\n\\n The milkers formed quite a little battalion of men and maids, the men operating on the hard-teated animals, the maids on the kindlier natures. It was a large dairy. There were nearly a hundred milchers under Crick\u0027s management, all told; and of the herd the master-dairyman milked six or eight with his own hands, unless away from home. These were the cows that milked hardest of all; for his journey-milkmen being more or less casually hired, he would not entrust this half-dozen to their treatment, lest, from indifference, they should not milk them fully; nor to the maids, lest they should fail in the same way for lack of finger-grip; with the result that in course of time the cows would `go azew\u0027 - that is, dry up. It was not the loss for the moment that made slack milking so serious, but that with the decline of demand there came decline, and ultimately cessation, of supply. \\n\\n After Tess had settled down to her cow there was for a time no talk in the barton, and not a sound interfered with the purr of the milk-jets into the numerous palls, except a momentary exclamation to one or other of the beasts requesting her to turn round or stand still. The only movements were those of the milkers\u0027 hands up and down, and the swing of the cows\u0027 tails. Thus they all worked on, encompassed by the vast flat mead which extended to either slope of the valley - a level landscape compounded of old landscapes long forgotten, and, no doubt, differing in character very greatly from the landscape they composed now. \\n\\n `To my thinking,\u0027 said the dairyman, rising suddenly from a cow he had just finished off, snatching up his three-legged stool in one hand and the pail in the other, and moving on to the next hard-yielder in his vicinity; `to my thinking, the cows don\u0027t gie down their milk to-day as usual. Upon my life, if Winker do begin keeping back like this, she\u0027ll not be worth going under by midsummer.\u0027 \\n\\n `\u0027Tis because there\u0027s a new hand come among us,\u0027 said Jonathan Kail. `I\u0027ve noticed such things afore.\u0027 \\n\\n `To be sure. It may be so. I didn\u0027t think o\u0027t.\u0027 \\n\\n `I\u0027ve been told that it goes up into their horns at such times,\u0027 said a dairymaid. \\n\\n `Well, as to going up into their horns,\u0027 replied Dairyman Crick dubiously, as though even witchcraft might be limited by anatomical possibilities, `I couldn\u0027t say; I certainly could not. But as nott cows will keep it back as well as the horned ones, I don\u0027t quite agree to it. Do ye know that riddle about the nott cows, Jonathan? Why do nott cows give less milk in a year than horned?\u0027 \\n\\n `I don\u0027t!\u0027 interposed the milkmaid. `Why do they?\u0027 \\n\\n `Because there bain\u0027t so many of \u0027em,\u0027 said the dairyman. `Howsomever, these gamisters do certainly keep back their milk to-day. Folks, we must lift up a stave or two - that\u0027s the only cure for\u0027t.\u0027 \\n\\n Songs were often resorted to in dairies hereabout as an enticement to the cows when they showed signs of withholding their usual yield; and the band of milkers at this request burst into melody - in purely business-like tones, it is true, and with no great spontaneity; the result, according to their own belief, being a decided improvement during the song\u0027s continuance. When they had gone through fourteen or fifteen verses of a cheerful ballad about a murderer who was afraid to go to bed in the dark because he saw certain brimstone flames around him, one of the male milkers said-- \\n\\n `I wish singing on the stoop didn\u0027t use up so much of a man\u0027s wind! You should get your harp, sir; not but what a fiddle is best.\u0027 \\n\\n Tess, who had given ear to this, thought the words were addressed to the dairyman, but she was wrong. A reply, in the shape of `Why?\u0027came as it were out of the belly of a dun cow in the stalls; it had been spoken by a milker behind the animal, whom she had not hitherto perceived. \\n\\n `Oh yes; there\u0027s nothing like a fiddle,\u0027 said the dairyman. `Though I do think that bulls are more moved by a tune than cows - at least that\u0027s my experience. Once there was a old aged man over at Mellstock - William Dewy by name - one of the family that used to do a good deal of business as tranters over there, Jonathan, do ye mind? - I knowed the man by sight as well as I know my own brother, in a manner of speaking. Well, this man was a coming home-along from a wedding where he had been playing his fiddle, one fine moonlight night, and for shortness\u0027 sake he took a cut across Forty-acres, a field lying that way, where a bull was out to grass. The bull seed William, and took after him, horns aground, begad; and though William runned his best, and hadn\u0027t much drink in him (considering \u0027twas a wedding, and the folks well off), he found he\u0027d never reach the fence and get over in time to save himself. Well, as a last thought, he pulled out his fiddle as he runned, and struck up a jig, turning to the bull, and backing towards the corner. The bull softened down, and stood still, looking hard at William Dewy, who fiddled on and on; till a sort of a smile stole over the bull\u0027s face. But no sooner did William stop his playing and turn to get over hedge than the bull would stop his smiling and lower his horns towards the seat of William\u0027s breeches. Well, William had to turn about and play on, willy-nilly; and \u0027twas only three o\u0027clock in the world, and \u0027a knowed that nobody would come that way for hours, and he so leery and tired that \u0027a didn\u0027t know what to do. When he had scraped till about four o\u0027clock he felt that he verily would have to give over soon, and he said to himself, \"There\u0027s only this last tune between me and eternal welfare! Heaven save me, or I\u0027m a done man.\" Well, then he called to mind how he\u0027d seen the cattle kneel o\u0027 Christmas Eves in the dead o\u0027 night. It was not Christmas Eve then, but it came into his head to play a trick upon the bull. So he broke into the \u0027Tivity Hymn, just as at Christmas carol-singing; when, lo and behold, down went the bull on his bended knees, in his ignorance, just as if \u0027twere the true \u0027Tivity night and hour. As soon as his horned friend were down, William turned, clinked off like a long-dog, and jumped safe over hedge, before the praying bull had got on his feet again to take after him. William used to say that he\u0027d seen a man look a fool a good many times, but never such a fool as that bull looked when he found his pious feelings had been played upon, and \u0027twas not Christmas Eve... Yes, William Dewy, that was the man\u0027s name; and I can tell you to a foot where\u0027s he a-lying in Mellstock Churchyard at this very moment - just between the second yew-tree and the north aisle.\u0027 \\n\\n `It\u0027s a curious story; it carries us sack to medieval times, when faith was a living thing!\u0027 \\n\\n The remark, singular for a dairy-yard, was murmured by the voice behind the dun cow; but as nobody understood the reference no notice was taken, except that the narrator seemed to think it might imply scepticism as to his tale. \\n\\n `Well, \u0027tis quite true, sir, whether or no. I knowed the man well.\u0027 \\n\\n `Oh yes; I have no doubt of it,\u0027 said the person behind the dun cow. \\n\\n Tess\u0027s attention was thus attracted to the dairyman\u0027s interlocutor, of whom she could see but the merest patch, owing to his burying his head so persistently in the flank of the milcher. She could not understand why he should be addressed as `sir\u0027 even by the dairyman himself. But no explanation was discernible; he remained under the cow long enough to have milked three, uttering a private ejaculation now and then, as if he could not get on. \\n\\n `Take it gentle, sir; take it gentle,\u0027 said the dairyman. `\u0027Tis knack, not strength that does it.\u0027 \\n\\n `So I find,\u0027 said the other, standing up at last and stretching his arms. `I think I have finished her, however, though she made my fingers ache.\u0027 \\n\\n Tess could then see him at full length. He wore the ordinary white pinner and leather leggings of a dairy-farmer when milking, and his boots were clogged with the mulch of the yard; but this was all his local livery. Beneath it was something educated, reserved, subtle, sad, differing. \\n\\n But the details of his aspect were temporarily thrust aside by the discovery that he was one whom she had seen before. Such vicissitudes had Tess passed through since that time that for a moment she could not remember where she had met him; and then it flashed upon her that he was the pedestrian who had joined in the club-dance at Marlott - the passing stranger who had come she knew not whence, had danced with others but not with her, had slightingly left her, and gone on his way with his friends. \\n\\n The flood of memories brought back by this revival of an incident anterior to her troubles produced a momentary dismay lest, recognizing her also, he should by some means discover her story. But it passed away when she found no sign of remembrance in him. She saw by degrees that since their first and only encounter his mobile face had grown more thoughtful, and had acquired a young man\u0027s shapely moustache and beard - the latter of the palest straw colour where it began upon his cheeks, and deepening to a warm brown farther from its root. Under his linen milking-pinner he wore a dark velveteen jacket, cord breeches and gaiters, and a starched white shirt. Without the milking-gear nobody could have guessed what he was. He might with equal probability have been an eccentric landowner or a gentlemanly ploughman. That he was but a novice at dairy-work she had realized in a moment, from the time he had spent upon the milking of one cow. \\n\\n Meanwhile many of the milkmaids had said to one another of the new-comer, `How pretty she is!\u0027 with something of real generosity and admiration, though with a half hope that the auditors would qualify the assertion - which, strictly speaking, they might have done, prettiness being an inexact definition of what struck the eye in Tess. When the milking was finished for the evening they straggled indoors, where Mrs Crick, the dairyman\u0027s wife - who was too respectable to go out milking herself, and wore a hot stuff gown in warm weather because the dairymaids wore prints - was giving an eye to the leads and things. \\n\\n Only two or three of the maids, Tess learnt, slept in the dairy-house besides herself; most of the helpers going to their homes. She saw nothing at supper-time of the superior milker who had commented on the story, and asked no questions about him, the remainder of the evening being occupied in arranging her place in the bed-chamber. It was a large room over the milk-house, some thirty feet long; the sleeping-cots of the other three indoor milkmaids being in the same apartment. They were blooming young women, and, except one, rather older than herself. By bedtime Tess was thoroughly tired, and fell asleep immediately. \\n\\n But one of the girls who occupied an adjoining bed was more wakeful than Tess, and would insist upon relating to the latter various particulars of the homestead into which she had just entered. The girl\u0027s whispered words mingled with the shades, and, to Tess\u0027s drowsy mind, they seemed to be generated by the darkness in which they floated. \\n\\n `Mr Angel Clare - he that is learning milking, and that plays the harp -never says much to us. He is a pa\u0027son\u0027s son, and is too much taken up wi\u0027 his own thoughts to notice girls. He is the dairyman\u0027s pupil - learning farming in all its branches. He has learnt sheep-farming at another place, and he\u0027s now mastering dairy-work... Yes, he is quite the gentleman-born. His father is the Reverent Mr Clare at Emminster - a good many miles from here.\u0027 \\n\\n `Oh - I have heard of him,\u0027 said her companion, now awake. `A very earnest clergyman, is he not?\u0027 \\n\\n `Yes - that he is - the earnestest man in all Wessex, they say the last of the old Low Church sort, they tell me - for all about here be what they call High. All his sons, except our Mr Clare, be made pa\u0027sons too.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/80/4712.html","bookId":538,"book":{"id":538,"title":"Tess of the D‘Urbervilles德伯家的苔丝","description":"简介： 《德伯家的苔丝》是哈代的代表作，是威塞克斯系列中的一部。它描写了一位农村姑娘的悲惨命运。哈代在小说的副标题中称女主人公为一个纯洁的女人，公开地向维多利亚时代虚伪的社会道德挑战。女主人公苔丝生于一个贫苦小贩家庭，父母要她到一个富老太婆家去攀亲戚，结果她...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12889203079f0f8.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/80","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
