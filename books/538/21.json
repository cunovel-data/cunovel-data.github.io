{"id":10493,"no":21,"title":"Chapter 21","content":"There was a great stir in the milk-house just after breakfast. The churn revolved as usual, but the butter would not come. Whenever this happened the dairy was paralyzed. Squish, squash, echoed the milk in the great cylinder, but never arose the sound they waited for. \\n\\n Dairyman Crick and his wife, the milkmaids Tess, Marian, Retty Priddle, Izz Huett, and the married ones from the cottages; also Mr Clare, Jonathan Kail, old Deborah, and the rest, stood gazing hopelessly at the churn; and the boy who kept the horse going outside put on moon-like eyes to show his sense of the situation. Even the melancholy horse himself seemed to look in at the window in inquiring despair at each walk round. \\n\\n `\u0027Tis years since I went to Conjuror Trendle\u0027s son in Egdon - years!\u0027 said the dairyman bitterly. `And he was nothing to what his father had been. I have said fifty times, if I have said once, that I don\u0027t believe in en; though a\u0027 do cast folks\u0027 waters very true. But I shall have to go to \u0027n if he\u0027s alive. O yes, I shall have to go to \u0027n, if this sort of thing continnys!\u0027 \\n\\n Even Mr Clare began to feel tragical at the dairyman\u0027s desperation. \\n\\n `Conjuror Fall, t\u0027other side of Casterbridge that they used to call \"Wide-O\", was a very good man when I was a boy,\u0027 said Jonathan Kail. `But he\u0027s rotten as touchwood by now.\u0027 \\n\\n `My grandfather used to go to Conjuror Mynterne, out at Owlscombe, and a clever man a\u0027 were, so I\u0027ve heard grandf\u0027er say, continued Mr Crick. `But there\u0027s no such genuine folk about nowadays!\u0027 \\n\\n Mrs Crick\u0027s mind kept nearer to the matter in hand. \\n\\n `Perhaps somebody in the house is in love,\u0027 she said tentatively. `I\u0027ve heard tell in my younger days that that will cause it. Why, Crick - that maid we had years ago, do ye mind, and how the butter didn\u0027t come then--\u0027 \\n\\n `Ah yes, yes! - but that isn\u0027t the rights o\u0027t. It had nothing to do with the love-making. I can mind all about it--\u0027twas the damage to the churn.\u0027 \\n\\n He turned to Clare. \\n\\n `Jack Dollop, a \u0027hore\u0027s-bird of a fellow we had here as milker at one time, sir, courted a young woman over at Mellstock, and deceived her as he had deceived many afore. But he had another sort o\u0027 woman to reckon wi\u0027 this time, and it was not the girl herself. One Holy Thursday, of all days in the almanack, we was where as we mid be now, only there was no churning in hand, when we zid the girl\u0027s mother coming up to the door, wi\u0027 a great brass-mounted umbrella in her hand that would ha\u0027 felled an ox, and saying \"Do Jack Dollop work here? - because I want him! I have a big bone to pick with he, I can assure \u0027n!\" And some way behind her mother walked Jack\u0027s young woman, crying bitterly into her handkercher. \"O Lard, here\u0027s a time!\" said jack, looking out o\u0027 winder at \u0027em. \"She\u0027ll murder me! Where shall I get-where shall I - ? Don\u0027t tell her where I be!\" And with that he scrambled into the churn through the trap-door, and shut himself inside, just as the young woman\u0027s mother busted into the milk-house. \"The villain - where is he?\" says she, \"I\u0027ll claw his face for\u0027n, let me only catch him!\" Well, she hunted about everywhere, ballyragging Jack by side and by seam, Jack lying a\u0027most stifled inside the churn, and the poor maid - or young woman rather - standing at the door crying her eyes out. I shall never forget it, never! \u0027Twould have melted a marble stone! But she couldn\u0027t find him nowhere at all.\u0027 \\n\\n The dairyman paused, and one or two words of comment came from the listeners. \\n\\n Dairyman Crick\u0027s stories often seemed to be ended when they were not really so, and strangers were betrayed into premature interjections of finality; though old friends knew better. The narrator went on-- \\n\\n `Well, how the old woman should have had the wit to guess it I could never tell, but she found out that he was inside that there churn. Without saying a word she took hold of the winch (it was turned by handpower then), and round she swung him, and jack began to flop about inside. \"O Lard! stop the churn! let me out!\" says he, popping out his head, \"I shall be churned into a pummy!\" (he was a cowardly chap in his heart, as such men mostly be). \"Not till ye make amends for ravaging her virgin innocence!\" says the old woman. \"Stop the churn, you old witch!\" screams he. \"You call me old witch, do ye, you deceiver!\" says she, \"when ye ought to ha\u0027 been calling me mother-law these last five months!\" And on went the churn, and Jack\u0027s bones rattled round again. Well, none of us ventured to interfere; and at last \u0027a promised to make it right wi\u0027 her. \"Yes - I\u0027ll be as good as my word!\" he said. And so it ended that day.\u0027 \\n\\n While the listeners were smiling their comments there was a quick movement behind their backs, and they looked round. Tess, pale-faced, had gone to the door. \\n\\n `How warm \u0027tis to-day!\u0027 she said, almost inaudibly. \\n\\n It was warm, and none of them connected her withdrawal with the reminiscences of the dairyman. He went forward, and opened the door for her, saying with tender raillery-- \\n\\n `Why, maidy\u0027 (he frequently, with unconscious irony, gave her this pet name), `the prettiest milker I\u0027ve got in my dairy; you mustn\u0027t get so fagged as this at the first breath of summer weather, or we shall be finely put to for want of \u0027ee by dog-days, shan\u0027t we, Mr Clare?\u0027 \\n\\n `I was faint - and - I think I am better out o\u0027 doors,\u0027 she said mechanically; and disappeared outside. \\n\\n Fortunately for her the milk in the revolving churn at that moment changed its squashing for a decided flick-flack. \\n\\n `\u0027Tis coming!\u0027 cried Mrs Crick, and the attention of all was called off from Tess. \\n\\n That fair sufferer soon recovered herself externally, but she remained much depressed all the afternoon. When the evening milking was done she did not care to be with the rest of them, and went out of doors wandering along she knew not whither. She was wretched - O so wretched - at the perception that to her companions the dairyman\u0027s story had been rather a humorous narration than otherwise; none of them but herself seemed to see the sorrow of it; to a certainty, not one knew how cruelly it touched the tender place in her experience. The evening sun was now ugly to her, like a great inflamed wound in the sky. Only a solitary cracked-voiced reed-sparrow greeted her from the bushes by the river, in a sad, machine-made tone, resembling that of a past friend whose friendship she had outworn. \\n\\n In these long June days the milkmaids, and, indeed, most of the household, went to bed at sunset or sooner, the morning work before milking being so early and heavy at a time of full pails. Tess usually accompanied her fellows upstairs. To-night, however, she was the first to go to their common chamber; and she had dozed when the other girls came in. She saw them undressing in the orange light of the vanished sun, which flushed their forms with its colour; she dozed again, but she was reawakened by their voices, and quietly turned her eyes towards them. \\n\\n Neither of her three chamber-companions had got into bed. They were standing in a group, in their nightgowns, barefooted, at the window, the last red rays of the west still warming their faces and necks, and the walls around them. All were watching somebody in the garden with deep interest, their three faces close together: a jovial and round one, a pale one with dark hair and a fair one whose tresses were auburn. \\n\\n `Don\u0027t push! You can see as well as I,\u0027 said Retty, the auburn-haired and youngest girl, without removing her eyes from the window. \\n\\n `\u0027Tis no use for you to be in love with him any more than me, Retty Priddle,\u0027 said jolly-faced Marian, the eldest, silly. `His thoughts be of other cheeks than thine!\u0027 \\n\\n Retty Priddle still looked, and the others looked again. \\n\\n `There he is again!\u0027 cried Izz Huett, the pale girl with dark damp hair and keenly cut lips. \\n\\n `You needn\u0027t say anything, Izz,\u0027 answered Retty. `For I zid you kissing his shade.\u0027 \\n\\n `What did you see her doing?\u0027 asked Marian. \\n\\n `Why - he was standing over the whey-tub to let off the whey, and the shade of his face came upon the wall behind, close to Izz, who was standing there filling a vat. She put her mouth against the wall and kissed the shade of his mouth; I zid her, though he didn\u0027t.\u0027 \\n\\n `O Izz Huett!\u0027 said Marian. \\n\\n A rosy spot came into the middle of Izz Huett\u0027s cheek. \\n\\n `Well, there was no harm in it,\u0027 she declared, with attempted coolness. `And if I be in love wi\u0027en, so is Retty, too; and so be you, Marian, come to that.\u0027 \\n\\n Marian\u0027s full face could not blush past its chronic pinkness. \\n\\n `I!\u0027 she said. `What a tale! Ah, there he is again! Dear eyes - dear face - dear Mr Clare!\u0027 \\n\\n `There - you\u0027ve owned it!\u0027 \\n\\n `So have you - so have we all,\u0027 said Marian, with the dry frankness of complete indifference to opinion. `It is silly to pretend otherwise amongst ourselves, though we need not own it to other folks. I would just marry \u0027n to-morrow!\u0027 \\n\\n `So would I - and more,\u0027 murmured Izz Huett. \\n\\n `And I too,\u0027 whispered the more timid Retty. \\n\\n The listener grew warm. \\n\\n `We can\u0027t all marry him,\u0027 said Izz. \\n\\n `We shan\u0027t, either of us; which is worse still,\u0027 said the eldest. `There he is again!\u0027 \\n\\n They all three blew him a silent kiss. \\n\\n `Why?\u0027 asked Retty quickly. \\n\\n `Because he likes Tess Durbeyfield best,\u0027 said Marian, lowering her voice. `I have watched him every day, and have found it out.\u0027 \\n\\n There was a reflective silence. \\n\\n `But she don\u0027t care anything for \u0027n?\u0027 at length breathed Retty. \\n\\n `Well - I sometimes think that too.\u0027 \\n\\n `But how silly all this is!\u0027 said Izz Huett impatiently. `Of course he won\u0027t marry any one of us, or Tess either - a gentleman\u0027s son, who\u0027s going to be a great landowner and farmer abroad! More likely to ask us to come wi\u0027en as farm-hands at so much a year!\u0027 \\n\\n One sighed, and another sighed, and Marian\u0027s plump figure sighed biggest of all. Somebody in bed hard by sighed too. Tears came into the eyes of Retty Priddle, the pretty red-haired youngest - the last bud of the Paridelles, so important in the county annals. They watched silently a little longer, their three faces still close together as before, and the triple hues of their hair mingling. But the unconscious Mr Clare had gone indoors, and they saw him no more; and, the shades beginning to deepen, they crept into their beds. In a few minutes they heard him ascend the ladder to his own room. Marian was soon snoring, but Izz did not drop into forgetfulness for a long time. Retty Priddle cried herself to sleep. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/80/4716.html","bookId":538,"book":{"id":538,"title":"Tess of the D‘Urbervilles德伯家的苔丝","description":"简介： 《德伯家的苔丝》是哈代的代表作，是威塞克斯系列中的一部。它描写了一位农村姑娘的悲惨命运。哈代在小说的副标题中称女主人公为一个纯洁的女人，公开地向维多利亚时代虚伪的社会道德挑战。女主人公苔丝生于一个贫苦小贩家庭，父母要她到一个富老太婆家去攀亲戚，结果她...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12889203079f0f8.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/80","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
