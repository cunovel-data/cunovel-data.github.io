{"id":10476,"no":4,"title":"Chapter 4","content":"Rolliver\u0027s inn, the single alehouse at this end of the long and broken village, could only boast of an off-license; licence, as nobody could legally drink on the premises, the amount of overt accommodation for consumers was strictly limited to a little board about six inches wide and two yards long, fixed to the garden palings by pieces of wire, so as to form a ledge. On this board thirsty strangers deposited their cups as they stood in the road and drank, and threw the dregs on the dusty ground to the pattern of Polynesia, and wished they could have a restful seat inside. \n Thus the strangers. But there were also local customers who felt the same wish; and where there\u0027s a will there\u0027s a way. \n In a large bedroom upstairs, the window of which was thickly curtained with a great woollen shawl lately discarded by the landlady Mrs Rolliver, were gathered on this evening nearly a dozen persons, all seeking beatitude; all old inhabitants of the nearer end of Marlott, and frequenters of this retreat. Not only did the distance to The Pure Drop, the fully-licensed tavern at the further part of the dispersed village, render its accommodation practically unavailable for dwellers at this end; but the far more serious question, the quality of the liquor, confirmed the prevalent opinion that it was better to drink with Rolliver in a corner of the housetop than with the other landlord in a wide house. \n A gaunt four-post bedstead which stood in the room afforded sitting-space for several persons gathered round three of its sides; a couple more men had elevated themselves on a chest of drawers; another rested on the oak-carved `cwoffer\u0027; two on the washstand; another on the stool; and thus all were, somehow, seated at their ease. The stage of mental comfort to which they had arrived at his hour was one wherein their souls expanded beyond their skins, and spread their personalities warmly through the room. In this process the chamber and its furniture grew more and more dignified and luxurious; the shawl hanging at the window took upon itself the richness of tapestry; the brass handles of the chest of drawers were as golden knockers; and the carved bed-posts seemed to have some kinship with the magnificent pillars of Solomon\u0027s temple. \n Mrs Durbeyfield, having quickly walked hitherward after parting from Tess, opened the front door, crossed the downstairs room, which was in deep gloom, and then unfastened the stair-door like one whose fingers knew the tricks of the latches well. Her ascent of the crooked staircase was a slower process, and her face, as it rose into the light above the last stair, encountered the gaze of all the party assembled in the bedroom. \n `------Being a few private friends I\u0027ve asked in to keep up club walking at my own expense,\u0027 the landlady exclaimed at the sound of footsteps, as glibly as a child repeating the Catechism, while she peered over the stairs. `Oh, `tis you, Mrs Durbeyfield - Lard - how you frightened me! I thought it might be some gaffer sent by Government.\u0027 \n Mrs Durbeyfield was welcomed with glances and nods by the remainder of the conclave, and turned to where her husband sat. He was humming absently to himself, in a low tone: `I be as good as some folks here and there! I\u0027ve got a great family vault at Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill, and finer skillentons than any man in Wessex!\u0027 \n `I\u0027ve something to tell `ee that\u0027s come into my head about that a grand projick!\u0027 whispered his cheerful wife. `Here, John, don\u0027t `ee see me?\u0027 She nudged him, while he, looking through her as through a windowpane, went on with his recitative. \n `Hush! Don\u0027t `ee sing so loud, my good man,\u0027said the landlady; in case any member of the Government should be passing, and take away my license.\u0027 \n `He\u0027s told `ee what\u0027s happened to us, I suppose?\u0027 asked Mrs Durbeyfield. \n `Yes - in a way. D\u0027ye think there\u0027s any money hanging by it?\u0027 \n `Ah, that\u0027s the secret,\u0027 said Joan Durbeyfield sagely. `However, tis well to be kin to a coach, even if you don\u0027t ride in `en.\u0027 She dropped her public voice, and continued in a low tone to her husband: `I\u0027ve been thinking since you brought the news that there\u0027s a great rich lady out by Trantridge, on the edge o\u0027 The Chase, of the name of d\u0027Urberville.\u0027 \n `Hey - what\u0027s that?\u0027 said Sir John. \n She repeated the information. `That lady must be our relation,\u0027she said. `And my projick is to send Tess to claim kin.\u0027 \n `There is a lady of the name, now you mention it,\u0027said Durbeyfield. `Pa\u0027son Tringham didn\u0027t think of that. But she\u0027s nothing beside we - a junior branch of us, no doubt, hailing long since King Norman\u0027s day.\u0027 \n While this question was being discussed neither of the pair noticed, in their preoccupation, that little Abraham had crept into the room, and was awaiting an opportunity of asking them to return. \n `She is rich, and she\u0027d be sure to take notice o\u0027 the maid,\u0027 continued Mrs Durbeyfield; `and `twill be a very good thing. I don\u0027t see why two branches o\u0027 one family should not be on visiting terms.\u0027 \n `Yes; and we\u0027ll all claim kin!\u0027 said Abraham brightly from under the bedstead. `And we\u0027ll all go and see her when Tess has gone to live with her; and we\u0027ll ride in her coach and wear black clothes!\u0027 \n `How do you come here, child? What nonsense be ye talking! Go away, and play on the stairs till father and mother be ready! Well, Tess ought to go to this other member of our family. She\u0027d be sure to win the lady - Tess would; and likely enough It would lead to some noble gentleman marrying her. In short, I know it.\u0027 \n `How?\u0027 \n `I tried her fate in the Fortune-Teller, and it brought out that very thing! You should ha\u0027 seen how pretty she looked today; her skin is as sumple as a duchess\u0027s.\u0027 \n `What says the maid herself to going?\u0027 \n `I\u0027ve not asked her. She don\u0027t know there is any such lady relation yet. But it would certainly put her in the way of a grand marriage, and she won\u0027t say nay to going.\u0027 \n `Tess is queer.\u0027 \n `But she\u0027s tractable at bottom. Leave her to me.\u0027 \n Though this conversation had been private, sufficient of its import reached the understandings of those around to suggest to them that the Durbeyfields had weightier concerns to talk of now than common folks had, and that Tess, their pretty eldest daughter had fine prospects in store. \n `Tess is a fine figure o\u0027 fun, as I said to myself today when I zeed her vamping round parish with the rest,\u0027 observed one of the elderly boozers in an undertone.\u0027But Joan Durbeyfield must mind that she don\u0027t get green malt in floor.\u0027 It was a local phrase which had a peculiar meaning, and there was no reply. \n The conversation became inclusive, and presently other footsteps were heard crossing the room below. \n `------Being a few private friends asked in tonight to keep up club-walking at my own expense.\u0027 The landlady had rapidly reused the formula she kept on hand for intruders before she recognized that the newcomer was Tess. \n Even to her mother\u0027s gaze the girl\u0027s young features looked sadly out of place amid the alcoholic vapours which floated here as no unsuitable medium for wrinkled middle-age; and hardly was a reproachful f lash f rom Tess\u0027s dark eyes needed to make her father and mother rise from their seats, hastily finish their ale, and descend the stairs behind her, Mrs Rolliver\u0027s caution following their footsteps. \n `No noise, please, if yell be so good, my dears or I mid lose my license, and be summons\u0027d, and I don\u0027t know what all! `Night t\u0027ye!\u0027 \n They went home together, Tess holding one arm of her father, and Mrs Durbeyfield the other. He had, in truth, drunk very little - not a fourth of the quantity which a systematic tippler could carry to church on a Sunday afternoon without a hitch in his eastings or genuflections; but the weakness of Sir John\u0027s constitution made mountains of his petty sins in this kind. On reaching the fresh air he was sufficiently unsteady to incline the row of three at one moment as if they were marching to London, and at another as if they were marching to Bath - which produced a comical effect, frequent enough in families on nocturnal home goings; and, like most comical effects, not quite so comic after all. The two women valiantly disguised these forced excursions and countermarches as well as they could from Durbeyfield their cause, and from Abraham, and from themselves; and so they approached by degrees their own door, the head of the family bursting suddenly into his former refrain as he drew near, as if to fortify his soul at sight of the smallness of his present residence-- \n `I\u0027ve got a fam - ily vault at Kingsbere!\u0027 \n `Hush - don\u0027t be so silly, Jacky,\u0027 said his wife. `Yours is not the only family that was of `count in wold days. Look at the Anktells, and Horseys, and the Tringhams themselves gone to seed almost as much as you - though you was bigger folks than they, that\u0027s true. Thank God, I was never of no family, and have nothing to be ashamed of in that way!\u0027 \n `Don\u0027t you be so sure o\u0027 that. From your father `tis my belief you\u0027ve disgraced yourselves more than any o\u0027 us, and was kings and queens outright at one time.\u0027 \n Tess turned the subject by saying what was far more prominent in her own mind at the moment than thoughts of her ancestry-- \n `I am afraid father won\u0027t be able to take the journey with the beehives tomorrow so early.\u0027 \n `I? I shall be all right in an hour or two,\u0027 said Durbeyfield. \n It was eleven o\u0027clock before the family were all in bed, and two o\u0027clock next morning was the latest hour for starting with the beehives if they were to be delivered to the retailers in Caster-bridge before the Saturday market began, the way thither lying by bad roads over a distance of between twenty and thirty miles, and the horse and waggon being of the slowest. At half-past one Mrs Durbeyfield came into the large bedroom where Tess and all her little brothers and sisters slept. \n `The poor man can\u0027t go,\u0027 she said to her eldest daughter, whose great eyes had opened the moment her mother\u0027s hand touched the door. \n Tess sat up in bed, lost in a vague interspace between a dream and this information. \n `But somebody must go,\u0027 she replied. `It is late for the hives already. Swarming will soon be over for the year; and if we put off taking `em till next week\u0027s market the call for\u0027em will be past, and they\u0027ll be thrown on our hands.\u0027 \n Mrs Durbeyfield looked unequal to the emergency. `Some young feller, perhaps, would go? One of them who were so much after dancing with `ee yesterday,\u0027 she presently suggested. \n `O no - I wouldn\u0027t have it for the world!\u0027declared Tess proudly. `And letting everybody know the reason such a thing to be ashamed of! I think I could go if Abraham could go with me to kip me company.\u0027 \n Her mother at length agreed to this arrangement. little Abraham was aroused from his deep sleep in a corner of the same apartment, and made to put on his clothes while still mentally in the other world. Meanwhile Tess had hastily dressed herself; and the twain, lighting a lantern, went out to the stable. The rickety little waggon was already laden, and the girl led out the horse Prince, only a degree less rickety than the vehicle. \n The poor creature looked wonderingly round at the night, at the lantern, at their two figures, as if he could not believe that at that hour, when every living thing was intended to be in shelter and at rest, he was called upon to go out and labour. They put a stock of candle ends into the lantern, hung the latter to the off side of the load, and directed the horse onward, walking at his shoulder at first during the uphill parts of the way, in order not to overload an animal of so little vigour. To cheer themselves as well as they could, they made an artificial morning with the lantern, some bread and butter, and their own conversation, the real morning being far from come. Abraham, as he more fully awoke (for he had moved in a sort of trance so far), began to talk of the strange shapes assumed by the various dark objects against the sky; of this tree that looked like a raging tiger springing from a lair; of that which resembled a giant\u0027s head. \n When they had passed the little town of Stourcastle, dumbly somnolent under its thick brown thatch, they reached higher ground. Still higher, on their left, the elevation called Bulbarrow or Bealbarrow, well-nigh the highest in South Wessex, swelled into the sky, engirdled by its earthen trenches. From hereabout the long road was fairly level for some distance onward. They mounted in front of the waggon, and Abraham grew reflective. \n `Tess!\u0027 he said in a preparatory tone, after a silence. \n `Yes, Abraham.\u0027 \n `Bain\u0027t you glad that we\u0027ve become gentlefolk?\u0027 \n `Not particular glad.\u0027 \n `But you be glad that you `m going to marry a gentleman?\u0027 \n `What?\u0027 said Tess, lifting her face. \n `That our great relation will help `ee to marry a gentleman.\u0027 \n `I? Our great relation? We have no such relation. What has put that into your head?\u0027 \n `I heard `em talking about it up at Rolliver\u0027s when I went to find father. There\u0027s a rich lady of our family out at Trantridge, and mother said that if you claimed kin with the lady, she\u0027d put `ee in the way of marrying a gentleman.\u0027 \n His sister became abruptly still, and lapsed into a pondering silence. Abraham talked on, rather for the pleasure of utterance than for audition, so that his sister\u0027s abstraction was of no account. He leant back against the hives, and with upturned face made observations on the stars, whose cold pulses were beating amid the black hollows above, in serene dissociation from these two wisps of human life. He asked how far away those twinklers were, and whether God was on the other side of them. But ever and anon his childish prattle recurred to what impressed his imagination even more deeply than the wonders of creation. If Tess were made rich by marrying a gentleman, would she have money enough to buy a spyglass so large that it would draw the stars as near to her as Nettlecombe-Tout? \n The renewed subject, which seemed to have impregnated the whole family, filled Tess with impatience. \n `Never mind that now!\u0027 she exclaimed. \n `Did you say the stars were worlds, Tess?\u0027 \n `Yes.\u0027 \n `All like ours?\u0027 \n `I don\u0027t know; but I think so. They sometimes seem to be like apples on our stubbard tree. Most of them splendid and sound a few blighted.\u0027 \n `Which do we live on - a splendid one or a blighted one?\u0027 \n `A blighted one.\u0027 \n `\u0027Tis very unlucky that we didn\u0027t pitch on a sound one, when there were so many more of `em!\u0027 \n `Yes.\u0027 \n `Is it like that really, Tess said Abraham, turning to her much impressed, on reconsideration of this rare information. `How would it have been if we had pitched on a sound one?\u0027 \n `Well, father wouldn\u0027t have coughed and creeped about as he does, and wouldn\u0027t have got too tipsy to go this journey; and mother wouldn\u0027t have been always washing, and never getting finished.\u0027 \n `And you would have been a rich lady read-ymade, and not have had to be made rich by marrying a gentleman?\u0027 \n `O Aby, don\u0027t - don\u0027t talk of that any more!\u0027 \n Left to his reflections Abraham soon grew drowsy. Tess was not skilful in the management of a horse, but she thought that she could take upon herself the entire conduct of the load for the present, and allow Abraham to go to sleep if he wished to do so. She made him a sort of nest in front of the hives, in such a manner that he could not fall, and, taking the reins into her own hands, jogged on as before. \n Prince required but slight attention, lacking energy for superfluous movements of any sort. With no longer a companion to distract her, Tess fell more deeply into reverie than ever, her back leaning against the hives. The mute procession past her shoulders of trees and hedges became attached to fantastic scenes outside reality, and the occasional heave of the wind became the sigh of some immense sad soul, conterminous with the universe in space, and with history in time. \n Then, examining the mesh of events in her own life, she seemed to see the vanity of her father\u0027s pride; the gentlemanly suitor awaiting herself in her mother\u0027s fancy; to see him as a grimacing personage, laughing at her poverty, and her shrouded knightly ancestry. Everything grew more and more extravagant, and she no longer knew how time passed. A sudden jerk shook her in her seat, and Tess awoke from the sleep into which she, too, had fallen. \n They were a long way further on than when she had lost consciousness, and the waggon had stopped. A hollow groan, unlike anything she had ever heard in her life, came from the front, followed by a shout of `Hoi there!\u0027 \n The lantern hanging at her waggon had gone out, but another was shining in her face - much brighter than her own had been. Something terrible had happened. The harness was entangled with an object which blocked the way. \n In consternation Tess jumped down, and discovered the dreadful truth. The groan had proceeded from her father\u0027s poor horse Prince. The morning mail-cart, with its two noiseless wheels, speeding along these lanes like an arrow, as it always did, had driven into her slow and unlighted equipage. The pointed shaft of the cart had entered the breast of the unhappy Prince like a sword, and from the wound his life\u0027s blood was spouting in a stream, and falling with a hiss into the road. \n In her despair Tess sprang forward and put her hand upon the hole, with the only result that she became splashed from face to skirt with the crimson drops. Then she stood helplessly looking on. Prince also stood firm and motionless as long as he could; till he suddenly sank down in a heap, \n By this time the mail-cart man had joined her, and began dragging and unharnessing the hot form of Prince. But he was already dead, and, seeing that nothing more could be done immediately, the mail-cart man returned to his own animal, which was uninjured. \n `You was on the wrong side,\u0027he said.\u0027I am bound to go on with the mail-bags, so that the best thing for you to do is to bide here with your load. I\u0027ll send somebody to help you as soon as I can. It is getting daylight, and you have nothing to fear.\u0027 \n He mounted and sped on his way; while Tess stood and waited. The atmosphere turned pale, the birds shook themselves in the hedges, arose, and twittered; the lane showed all its white features, and Tess showed hers, still whiter. The huge pool of blood in front of her was already assuming the iridescence of coagulation; and when the sun rose a hundred prismatic hues were reflected from it. Prince lay alongside still and stark; his eyes half open, the hole in his chest looking scarcely large enough to have let out all that had animated him. \n `\u0027Tis all my doing - all mine!\u0027 the girl cried, gazing at the spectacle. `No excuse for me none - What will mother and father live on now? Aby, Aby!\u0027 She shook the child, who had slept soundly through the whole disaster. `We can\u0027t go on with our load - Prince is killed!\u0027 \n When Abraham realized all, the furrows of fifty years were extemporized on his young face. \n `Why, I danced and laughed only yesterday!\u0027 she went on to herself. `To think that I was such a fool!\u0027 \n `Tis because we be on a blighted star, and not a sound one, isn\u0027t it, Tess?\u0027 murmured Abraham through his tears. \n In silence they waited through an interval which seemed endless. At length a sound, and an approaching object, proved to them that the driver of the mail-cart had been as good as his word. A farmer\u0027s man from near Stourcastle came up, leading a strong cob. He was harnessed to the waggon of beehives in the place of Prince, and the load taken on towards Casterbridge. \n The evening of the same day saw the empty waggon reach again the spot of the accident. Prince had lain there in the ditch since the morning; but the place of the blood-pool was still visible in the middle of the road, though scratched and scraped over by passing vehicles. All that was left of Prince was now hoisted into the waggon he had formerly hauled, and with his hoofs in the air, and his shoes shining in the setting sunlight, he retraced the eight or nine miles to Marlott. \n Tess had gone back earlier. How to break the news was more than she could think. It was a relief to her tongue to find from the faces of her parents that they already knew of their loss, though this did not lessen the self-reproach which she continued to heap upon herself for her negligence. \n But the very shiftlessness of the household rendered the misfortune a less terrifying one to them than it would have been to a striving family, though in the present case it meant ruin, and in the other it would only have meant inconvenience. In the Durbeyfield countenances there was nothing of the red wrath that would have burnt upon the girl from parents more ambitious for her welfare. Nobody blamed Tess as she blamed herself. \n When it was discovered that the knacker and tanner would give only a very few shillings for Prince\u0027s carcase because of his decrepitude, Durbeyfield rose to the occasion. \n `No,\u0027 said he stoically, `I won\u0027t sell his old body. When we d\u0027Urbervilles was knights in the land, we didn\u0027t sell our chargers for cat\u0027s meat. Let `em keep their shillings! He\u0027ve served me well in his lifetime, and I won\u0027t part from him now.\u0027 \n He worked harder the next day in digging a grave for Prince in the garden than he had worked for months to grow a crop for his family. When the hole was ready, Durbeyfield and his wife tied a rope round the horse and dragged him up the path towards it, the children following in funeral train. Abraham and `Liza-Lu sobbed, Hope and Modesty discharged their griefs in loud blares which echoed from the walls; and when Prince was tumbled in they gathered round the grave. The breadwinner had been taken away from them; what would they do? \n `Is he gone to heaven?\u0027 asked Abraham, between the sobs. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/80/4699.html","bookId":538,"book":{"id":538,"title":"Tess of the D‘Urbervilles德伯家的苔丝","description":"简介： 《德伯家的苔丝》是哈代的代表作，是威塞克斯系列中的一部。它描写了一位农村姑娘的悲惨命运。哈代在小说的副标题中称女主人公为一个纯洁的女人，公开地向维多利亚时代虚伪的社会道德挑战。女主人公苔丝生于一个贫苦小贩家庭，父母要她到一个富老太婆家去攀亲戚，结果她...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12889203079f0f8.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/80","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
