{"id":10524,"no":52,"title":"Chapter 52","content":"During the small hours of the next morning, while it was still dark, dwellers near the highways were conscious of a disturbance of their night\u0027s rest by rumbling noises, intermittently continuing till daylight - noises as certain to recur in this particular first week of the month as the voice of the cuckoo in the third week of the same. They were the preliminaries of the general removal, the passing of the empty waggons and teams to fetch the goods of the migrating families; for it was always by the vehicle of the farmer who required his services that the hired man was conveyed to his destination. That this might be accomplished within the day was the explanation of the reverberation occurring so soon after midnight, the aim of the carters being to reach the door of the outgoing households by six o\u0027clock, when the loading of their movables at once began. \\n\\n But to Tess and her mother\u0027s household no such anxious farmer sent his team. They were only women; they were not regular labourers; they were not particularly required anywhere; hence they had to hire a waggon at their own expense, and got nothing sent gratuitously. \\n\\n It was a relief to Tess, when she looked out of the window that morning, to find that though the weather was windy and louring, it did not rain, and that the waggon had come. A wet Lady-Day was a spectre which removing families never forgot; damp furniture, damp bedding, damp clothing accompanied it, and left a train of ills. \\n\\n Her mother, \u0027Liza-Lu, and Abraham were also awake, but the younger children were let sleep on. The four breakfasted by the thin light, and the `house-ridding\u0027 was taken in hand. \\n\\n It proceeded with some cheerfulness, a friendly neighbour or two assisting. When the large articles of furniture had been packed in position a circular nest was made of the beds and bedding, in which Joan Durbeyfield and the young children were to sit through the journey. After loading there was a long delay before the horses were brought, these having been unharnessed during the ridding; but at length, about two o\u0027clock, the whole was under way, the cooking-pot swinging from the axle of the waggon, Mrs Durbeyfield and family at the top, the matron having in her lap, to prevent injury to its works, the head of the clock, which, at any exceptional lurch of the waggon, struck one, or one-and-a-half, in hurt tones. Tess and the next eldest girl walked alongside till they were out of the village. \\n\\n They had called on a few neighbours that morning and the previous evening, and some came to see them off, all wishing them well, though, in their secret hearts, hardly expecting welfare possible to such a family, harmless as the Durbeyfields were to all except themselves. Soon the equipage began to ascend to higher ground, and the wind grew keener with the change of level and soil. \\n\\n The day being the sixth of April, the Durbeyfield waggon met many other waggons with families on the summit of the load, which was built on a wellnigh unvarying principle, as peculiar, probably, to the rural labourer as the hexagon to the bee. The groundwork of the arrangement was the family dresser, which, with its shining handles, and finger-marks, and domestic evidences thick upon it, stood importantly in front, over the tails of the shaft-horses, in its erect and natural position, like some Ark of the Covenant that they were bound to carry reverently. \\n\\n Some of the households were lively, some mournful; some were stopping at the doors of wayside inns; where, in due time, the Durbeyfield menagerie also drew up to bait horses and refresh the travellers. \\n\\n During the halt Tess\u0027s eyes fell upon a three-pint blue mug, which was ascending and descending through the air to and from the feminine section of a household, sitting on the summit of a load that had also drawn up at a little distance from the same inn. She followed one of the mug\u0027s journeys upward, and perceived it to be clasped by hands whose owner she well knew. Tess went towards the waggon. \\n\\n `Marian and Izz!\u0027 she cried to the girls, for it was they, sitting with the moving family at whose house they had lodged. `Are you house-ridding to-day, like everybody else?\u0027 \\n\\n They were, they said. It had been too rough a life for them at Flintcomb-Ash, and they had come away, almost without notice, leaving Groby to prosecute them if he chose. They told Tess their destination, and Tess told them hers. \\n\\n Marian leant over the load, and lowered her voice. `Do you know that the gentleman who follows \u0027ee - you\u0027ll guess who I mean - came to ask for \u0027ee at Flintcomb after you had gone? We didn\u0027t tell\u0027n where you was, knowing you wouldn\u0027t wish to see him.\u0027 \\n\\n `Ah - but I did see him!\u0027 Tess murmured. `He found me.\u0027 \\n\\n `And do he know where you be going?\u0027 \\n\\n `I think so.\u0027 \\n\\n `Husband come back?\u0027 \\n\\n `No.\u0027 \\n\\n She bade her acquaintance good-bye - for the respective carters had now come out from the inn - and the two waggons resumed their journey in opposite directions; the vehicle whereon sat Marian, Izz, and the ploughman\u0027s family with whom they had thrown in their lot, being brightly painted, and drawn by three powerful horses with shining brass ornaments on their harness; while the waggon on which Mrs Durbeyfield and her family rode was a creaking erection that would scarcely bear the weight of the superincumbent load; one which had known no paint since it was made, and drawn by two horses only. The contrast well marked the difference between being fetched by a thriving farmer and conveying oneself whither no hirer waited one\u0027s coming. \\n\\n The distance was great - too great for a day\u0027s journey - and it was with the utmost difficulty that the horses performed it. Though they had started so early it was quite late in the afternoon when they turned the flank of an eminence which formed part of the upland called Greenhill. While the horses stood to stale and breathe themselves Tess looked around. Under the hill, and just ahead of them, was the half-dead townlet of their pilgrimage, Kingsbere, where lay those ancestors of whom her father had spoken and sung to painfulness: Kingsbere, the spot of all spots in the world which could be considered the d\u0027Urbervilles\u0027 home, since they had resided there for full five hundred years. \\n\\n A man could be seen advancing from the outskirts towards them, and when he beheld the nature of their waggon-load he quickened his steps. \\n\\n `You be the woman they call Mrs Durbeyfield, I reckon?\u0027 he said to Tess\u0027s mother, who had descended to walk the remainder of the way. \\n\\n She nodded. `Though widow of the late Sir John d\u0027Urberville, poor nobleman, if I cared for my rights; and returning to the domain of his forefathers.\u0027 \\n\\n `Oh? Well, I know nothing about that; but if you be Mrs Durbeyfield, I am sent to tell \u0027ee that the rooms you wanted be let. We didn\u0027t know you was coming till we got your letter this morning - when \u0027twas too late. But no doubt you can get other lodgings somewhere.\u0027 \\n\\n The man had noticed the face of Tess, which had become ash-pale at his intelligence. Her mother looked hopelessly at fault. `What shall we do now, Tess?\u0027 she said bitterly. `Here\u0027s a welcome to your ancestors\u0027 lands! However, let\u0027s try further.\u0027 \\n\\n They moved on into the town, and tried with all their might, Tess remaining with the waggon to take care of the children whilst her mother and \u0027Liza-Lu made inquiries. At the last return of Joan to the vehicle, an hour later, when her search for accommodation had still been fruitless, the driver of the waggon said the goods must be unloaded, as the horses were half-dead, and he was bound to return part of the way at least that night. \\n\\n `Very well - unload it here,\u0027 said Joan recklessly. `I\u0027ll get shelter somewhere.\u0027 \\n\\n The waggon had drawn up under the churchyard wall, in a spot screened from view, and the driver, nothing loth, soon hauled down the poor heap of household goods. This done she paid him, reducing herself to almost her last shilling thereby, and he moved off and left them, only too glad to get out of further dealings with such a family. It was a dry night, and he guessed that they would come to no harm. \\n\\n Tess gazed desperately at the pile of furniture. The cold sunlight of this spring evening peered invidiously upon the crocks and kettles, upon the bunches of dried herbs shivering in the breeze, upon the brass handles of the dresser, upon the wicker-cradle they had all been rocked in, and upon the well-rubbed clock-case all of which gave out the reproachful gleam of indoor articles abandoned to the vicissitudes of a roofless exposure for which they were never made. Round about were deparked hills and slopes - now cut up into little paddocks - and the green foundations that showed where the d\u0027Urberville mansion once had stood; also an outlying stretch of Egdon Heath that had always belonged to the estate. Hard by, the aisle of the church called the d\u0027Urberville Aisle looked on imperturbably. \\n\\n `Isn\u0027t your family vault your own freehold?\u0027 said Tess\u0027s mother, as she returned from a reconnoitre of the church and graveyard. Why of course \u0027tis, and that\u0027s where we will camp, girls, till the place of your ancestors finds us a roof! Now Tess and \u0027Liza and Abraham, you help me. We\u0027ll make a nest for these children, and then we\u0027ll have another look round.\u0027 \\n\\n Tess listlessly lent a hand, and in a quarter of an hour the old four-post bedstead was dissociated from the heap of goods, and erected under the south wall of the church, the part of the building known as the d\u0027Urberville Aisle, beneath which the huge vaults lay. Over the tester of the bedstead was a beautifully traceried window, of many lights, its date being the fifteenth century. It was called the d\u0027Urberville Window, and in the upper part could be discerned heraldic emblems like those on Durbeyfield\u0027s old seal and spoon. \\n\\n Joan drew the curtains round the bed so as to make an excellent tent of it, and put the smaller children inside. `If it comes to the worst we can sleep there too, for one night,\u0027she said. `But let us try further on, and get something for the dears to eat! O, Tess, what\u0027s the use of your playing at marrying gentlemen, if it leaves us like this!\u0027 \\n\\n Accompanied by \u0027Liza-Lu and the boy she again ascended the little lane which secluded the church from the townlet. As soon as they got into the street they beheld a man on horseback gazing up and down. `Ah - I\u0027m looking for you!\u0027 he said, riding up to them. `This is indeed a family gathering on the historic spot!\u0027 \\n\\n It was Alec d\u0027Urberville. `Where is Tess?\u0027 he asked. \\n\\n Personally Joan had no liking for Alec. She cursorily signified the direction of the church, and went on, d\u0027Urberville saying that he would see them again, in case they should be still unsuccessful in their search for shelter, of which he had just heard. When they had gone d\u0027Urberville rode to the inn, and shortly after came out on foot. \\n\\n In the interim Tess, left with the children inside the bedstead, remained talking with them awhile, till, seeing that no more could be done to make them comfortable just then, she walked about the churchyard, now beginning to be embrowned by the shades of nightfall. The door of the church was unfastened, and she entered it for the first time in her life. \\n\\n Within the window under which the bedstead stood were the tombs of the family, covering in their dates several centuries. They were canopied, altar-shaped, and plain; their carvings being defaced and broken; their brasses torn from the matrices, the rivet-holes remaining like martin-holes in a sand-cliff. Of all the reminders that she had ever received that her people were socially extinct there was none so forcible as this spoliation. \\n\\n She drew near to a dark stone on which was inscribed: \\n\\n He leapt off the slab and supported her. \\n\\n `I saw you come in,\u0027 he said smiling, `and got up there not to interrupt your meditations. A family gathering, is it not, with these old fellows under us here? Listen.\u0027 \\n\\n He stamped with his heel heavily on the floor; whereupon there arose a hollow echo from below. \\n\\n `That shook them a bit, I\u0027ll warrant!\u0027 he continued. `And you thought I was the mere stone reproduction of one of them. But no. The old order changeth. The little finger of the sham d\u0027Urberville can do more for you than the whole dynasty of the real underneath... . Now command me. What shall I do?\u0027 \\n\\n `Go away!\u0027 she murmured. \\n\\n `I will - I\u0027ll look for your mother,\u0027 said he blandly. But in passing her he whispered: `Mind this; you\u0027ll be civil yet!\u0027 \\n\\n When he was gone she bent down upon the entrance to the vaults, and said-- \\n\\n `Why am I on the wrong side of this door!\u0027 \\n\\n In the meantime Marian and Izz Huett had journeyed onward with the chattels of the ploughman in the direction of their land of Canaan - the Egypt of some other family who had left it only that morning. But the girls did not for a long time think of where they were going. Their talk was of Angel Clare and Tess, and Tess\u0027s persistent lover, whose connection with her previous history they had partly heard and partly guessed ere this. \\n\\n `\u0027Tisn\u0027t as though she had never known him afore,\u0027 said Marian. `His having won her once makes all the difference in the world. \u0027Twould be a thousand pities if he were to tole her away again. Mr Clare can never be anything to us, Izz; and why should we grudge him to her, and not try to mend this quarrel? If he could only know what straits she\u0027s put to, and what\u0027s hovering round, he might come to take care of his own.\u0027 \\n\\n `Could we let him know?\u0027 \\n\\n They thought of this all the way to their destination; but the bustle of re-establishment in their new place took up all their attention then. But when they were settled, a month later, they heard of Clare\u0027s approaching return, though they had learnt nothing more of Tess. Upon that, agitated anew by their attachment to him, yet honourably disposed to her, Marian uncorked the penny ink-bottle they shared, and a few lines were concocted between the two girls. \\n\\n HONOUR\u0027D SIR - Look to your Wife if you do love her as much as she do love you. For she is sore put to by an Enemy in the shape of a Friend. Sir, there is one near her who ought to be Away.
