{"id":10527,"no":55,"title":"Chapter 55","content":"At eleven o\u0027clock that night, having secured a bed at one of the hotels and telegraphed his address to his father immediately on his arrival, he walked out into the streets of Sandbourne. It was too late to call on or inquire for any one, and he reluctantly postponed his purpose till the morning. But he could not retire to rest just yet. This fashionable watering-place, with its eastern and its western stations, its piers, its groves of pines, its promenades, and its covered gardens, was, to Angel Clare, like a fairy place suddenly created by the stroke of a wand, and allowed to get a little dusty. An outlying eastern tract of the enormous Egdon Waste was close at hand, yet on the very verge of that tawny piece of antiquity such a glittering novelty as this pleasure city had chosen to spring up. Within the space of a mile from its outskirts every irregularity of the soil was prehistoric, every channel an undisturbed British trackway; not a sod having been turned there since the days of the Czars. Yet the exotic had grown here, suddenly as the prophet\u0027s gourd; and had drawn hither Tess. By the midnight lamps he went up and down the winding ways of this new world in an old one, and could discern between the trees and against the stars the lofty roofs, chimneys, gazebos, and towers of the numerous fanciful residences of which the place was composed. It was a city of detached mansions; a Mediterranean lounging-place on the English Channel; and as seen now by night it seemed even more imposing than it was. The sea was near at hand, but not intrusive; it murmured, and he thought it was the pines; the pines murmured in precisely the same tones, and he thought they were the sea. Where could Tess possibly be, a cottage-girl, his young wife, amidst all this wealth and fashion? The more he pondered the more was he puzzled. Were there any cows to milk here? There certainly were no fields to till. She was most probably engaged to do something in one of these large houses; and he sauntered along, looking at the chamber-windows and their lights going out one by one; and wondered which of them might be hers. Conjecture was useless, and just after twelve o\u0027clock he entered and went to bed. Before putting out his light he re-read Tess\u0027s impassioned letter. Sleep, however, he could not, - so near her, yet so far from her - and he continually lifted the window-blind and regarded the backs of the opposite houses, and wondered behind which of the sashes she reposed at that moment. He might almost as well have sat up all night. In the morning he arose at seven, and shortly after went out, taking the direction of the chief post-office. At the door he met an intelligent postman coming out with letters for the morning delivery. `Do you know the address of a Mrs Clare?\u0027 asked Angel. The postman shook his head. Then, remembering that she would have been likely to continue the use of her maiden name, Clare said-- `Or a Miss Durbeyfield? `Durbeyfield?\u0027 This also was strange to the postman addressed. `There\u0027s visitors coming and going every day, as you know, sir,\u0027 he said; `and without the name of the house \u0027tis impossible to find \u0027em.\u0027 One of his comrades hastening out at that moment, the name was repeated to him. `I know no name of Durbeyfield; but there is the name of d\u0027Urberville at The Herons,\u0027 said the second. `That\u0027s it!\u0027 cried Clare, pleased to think that she had reverted to the real pronunciation. `What place is The Herons?\u0027 `A stylish lodging-house. \u0027Tis all lodging-houses here, bless \u0027ee.\u0027 Clare received directions how to find the house, and hastened thither, arriving with the milkman. The Herons, though an ordinary villa, stood in its own grounds, and was certainly the last place in which one would have expected to find lodgings, so private was its appearance. If poor Tess was a servant here, as he feared, she would go to the back-door to that milkman, and he was inclined to go thither also. However, in his doubts he turned to the front, and rang. The hour being early the landlady herself opened the door. Clare inquired for Teresa d\u0027Urberville or Durbeyfield. `Mrs d\u0027Urberville?\u0027 `Yes.\u0027 Tess, then, passed as a married woman, and he felt glad, even though she had not adopted his name. `Will you kindly tell her that a relative is anxious to see her?\u0027 `It is rather early. What name shall I give, sir?\u0027 `Angel.\u0027 `Mr Angel?\u0027 `No; Angel. It is my Christian name. She\u0027ll understand.\u0027 `I\u0027ll see if she is awake.\u0027 He was shown into the front room - the dining-room - and looked out through the spring curtains at the little lawn, and the rhododendrons and other shrubs upon it. Obviously her position was by no means so bad as he had feared, and it crossed his mind that she must somehow have claimed and sold the jewels to attain it. He did not blame her for one moment. Soon his sharpened ear detected footsteps upon the stairs, at which his heart thumped so painfully that he could hardly stand firm. `Dear me! what will she think of me, so altered as I am!\u0027 he said to himself; and the door opened. Tess appeared on the threshold - not at all as he had expected to see her - bewilderingly otherwise, indeed. Her great natural beauty was, if not heightened, rendered more obvious by her attire. She was loosely wrapped in a cashmere dressing-gown of gray-white, embroidered in half-mourning tints, and she wore slippers of the same hue. Her neck rose out of a frill of down, and her well-remembered cable of dark-brown hair was partially coiled up in a mass at the back of her head and partly hanging on her shoulder - the evident result of haste. He had held out his arms, but they had fallen again to his side; for she had not come forward, remaining still in the opening of the doorway. Mere yellow skeleton that he was now he felt the contrast between them, and thought his appearance distasteful to her. `Tess!\u0027 he said huskily, `can you forgive me for going away? Can\u0027t you - come to me? How do you get to be - like this?\u0027 `It is too late,\u0027 said she, her voice sounding hard through the room, her eyes shining unnaturally. `I did not think rightly of you - I did not see you as you were!\u0027 he continued to plead. `I have learnt to since, dearest Tessy mine!\u0027 `Too late, too late!\u0027 she said, waving her hand in the impatience of a person whose tortures cause every instant to seem an hour. `Don\u0027t come close to me, Angel! No - you must not. Keep away.\u0027 `But don\u0027t you love me, my dear wife, because I have been so pulled down by illness? You are not so fickle - I am come on purpose for you - my mother and father will welcome you now!\u0027 `Yes - O, yes, yes! But I say, I say it is too late.\u0027 She seemed to feel like a fugitive in a dream, who tries to move away, but cannot. `Don\u0027t you know all - don\u0027t you know it? Yet how do you come here if you do not know?\u0027 `I inquired here and there, and I found the way.\u0027 `I waited and waited for you,\u0027 she went on, her tones suddenly resuming their old fluty pathos. `But you did not come! And I wrote to you, and you did not come! He kept on saying you would never come any more, and that I was a foolish woman. He was very kind to me, and to mother, and to all of us after father\u0027s death. He--\u0027 `I don\u0027t understand.\u0027 `He has won me back to him.\u0027 Clare looked at her keenly, then, gathering her meaning, flagged like one plague-stricken, and his glance sank; it fell on her hands, which, once rosy, were now white and more delicate. She continued-- `He is upstairs. I hate him now, because he told me a lie - that you would not come again; and you have come! These clothes are what he\u0027s put upon me: I didn\u0027t care what he did wi\u0027 me! But - will you go away, Angel, please, and never come any more?\u0027 They stood fixed, their baffled hearts looking out of their eyes with a joylessness pitiful to see. Both seemed to implore something to shelter them from reality. `Ah - it is my fault!\u0027 said Clare. But he could not get on. Speech was as inexpressive as silence. But he had a vague consciousness of one thing, though it was not clear to him till later; that his original Tess had spiritually ceased to recognize the body before him as hers - allowing it to drift, like a corpse upon the current, in a direction dissociated from its living will.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/80/4750.html","bookId":538,"book":{"id":538,"title":"Tess of the D‘Urbervilles德伯家的苔丝","description":"简介： 《德伯家的苔丝》是哈代的代表作，是威塞克斯系列中的一部。它描写了一位农村姑娘的悲惨命运。哈代在小说的副标题中称女主人公为一个纯洁的女人，公开地向维多利亚时代虚伪的社会道德挑战。女主人公苔丝生于一个贫苦小贩家庭，父母要她到一个富老太婆家去攀亲戚，结果她...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12889203079f0f8.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/80","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:56 AM"}}
