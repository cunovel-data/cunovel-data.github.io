{"id":67381,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"Until she could have the real thing, why not have a little fun?\n And she didn’t want to be just another score for Brandon, she wanted all of him, heart, body and soul. The trouble was, she thought, slipping on her panties and hooking her bra in the half-light of the apartment, she thought Brandon wasn’t over Allie. Oh, sure, they’d split for the bazillionth time again just before Dead Heat went into production, but Cherise had wondered about that. The timing seemed a little too perfect for public fodder, a way to propel the on-again, off-again couple onto the front page of the tabloids, movie magazines, and Internet gossip. Brandon loved nothing more than to be “trending” and Allie was no better.\n Also, Cherise had seen the way they’d looked at each other when they’d thought no one was looking; not so much with anguish and longing, but as if they’d shared some huge private secret or joke.\n Or had it all been in her head?\n She’d been in love with Brandon since like for-ev-er. It was all she could do not to fall into his bed and fuck the hell out of him. God, she wanted to. So badly. But she needed more. So much more. And she was willing to sacrifice to get what she wanted.\n Hadn’t that always been the way? Since she was a little girl. She’d been the pretty one, the ambitious one. Her sister? Not so much. She’d been the daring one, always ready to take a dare or a risk.\n She still was.\n She slid on a pair of tight jeans and a sweater. Well, not just any sweater, but one that had been Allie’s from the costume department, one that Cherise had decided to “borrow,” a sweater people might recognize as belonging to or being a knockoff of one Allie had worn in a famous scene where she’d pulled it slowly over her head while straddling her male lead on a picnic table.\n Yep. Memorable.\n Riley or Reed or Randy had noticed. The sweater was definitely an ice-breaker and nearly any red-blooded man in America would love to see it pulled off by Allie Kramer, or someone who looked like her, while being straddled.\n Ryan or Whoever certainly had been turned on. Nearly came before he’d even kicked off his jeans.\n She loved that kind of power over men. Hey, it wouldn’t be bad over women either, a power Allie wielded as if it were her God-given right.\n Yeah, she thought, slipping outside without a second glance at the bedroom and the sleeping male within. She was glad Allie Kramer was gone.\n Glad, glad, glad! She hoped she never came back. Working for Allie had been like being in some kind of indentured servitude or worse. Cherise had been a slave to Allie’s whims, fantasies, frustrations, and ambitions. The woman had called her at any time day or night and yeah, she paid well, but if you figured out that Cherise had been forced to be available twenty-four/seven, she wondered if she’d even made minimum wage.\n All for the sake of being the “fabulous, beautiful, incredible Allie Kramer’s” assistant. Well, no more.\n She took the stairs and stepped outside to the vibrance and pulse of the city at night. Now that she’d let loose some of her frustrations, she wasn’t ready to call it a night. Not yet.\n There was still plenty to do, she thought, the dampness in the air invigorating, the prospect of the rest of her life exciting.\n “Mrs. Brandon McNary,” she said aloud. Not for the first time. She loved the sound of it. As long as Allie Kramer didn’t reappear, Cherise figured she had a good shot at making all of her dreams come true. “Mrs. Brandon McNary,” she repeated, a little louder, and tingled inside as she walked on the sidewalk.\n She would do anything. Any damned thing, to make certain she became Brandon’s wife. Allie Kramer didn’t stand a chance.\n ACT I\n She walked onto the balcony of the bed and breakfast. From the second story she heard the hustle and bustle of the city and viewed pedestrians walking briskly into the trendy restaurants and unique shops of this section of town. As a car passed on the street below, she narrowed her view to the West Hills, then leaned over the railing to gaze down the side street where the final scene of Dead Heat had been filmed, to that very spot where Lucinda Rinaldi had been shot and nearly killed.\n A pity about that, she thought. The “accident” had turned out wrong. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3/page-22.html","bookId":2675,"book":{"id":2675,"title":"After She\u0027s Gone (West Coast #3)","description":"Storyline: \n In this explosive new thriller, #1 New York Times bestselling author Lisa Jackson delves into the deep bond between two sisters and their shared dream that becomes a harrowing nightmare of madness, hatred and jealousy… \n Cassie Kramer and her younger sister, Allie, learned the hazards of fame long ago. Together, they’d survived the horror of a crazed fan who nearly killed their mother, former Hollywood actress Jenna Hughes. Still, Cassie moved to L.A., urging Allie to follow. As a team, they’d take the town by storm. But Allie, finally free of small-town Oregon, and just that little bit more beautiful, also proved to be more talented—and driven. Where Cassie got bit parts, Allie rose to stardom. But now her body double has been shot on the set of her latest movie—and Allie is missing. \n Police discover that the last call to Allie’s phone came from Cassie, though she has no recollection of making it. Instead of looking like a concerned relative, Cassie is starting to look like a suspect—the jealous sister who finally grew sick of playing a supporting role. As the tabloids go into a frenzy, Cassie ends up on a Portland psych ward. Is she just imagining the sinister figure who comes to her bedside, whispering about Allie—a visitor of whom there is no record? Is someone trying to help—or drive her mad? \n Convinced she’s the only one who can find Allie, Cassie checks herself out of the hospital. But a sudden slew of macabre murders— each victim masked with a likeness of a member of Cassie’s family—makes Cassie fear for her safety and her sanity.
