And I kind of see things from his perspective now.” She glanced out the window then added, “You know your sister wasn’t exactly easy to work for.”\n “Yes.” If Brandon McNary was an egocentric male, Allie was his female counterpart. “Do you know if she was ever in Santa Fe, or if she knew or contacted someone who lived there?”\n “Santa Fe?”\n “Maybe in 2007?”\n “I wasn’t working for her then.”\n “But she might have talked about it?”\n She rolled that around in her mind and scowled thoughtfully all the while slowly shaking her head. “Don’t know. Maybe? But geez, wouldn’t she have been a teenager and your mom have to give permission, or something?” After taking a final sip from her cup, she crumpled it in her fist. “I don’t remember her mentioning it, but she certainly didn’t tell me everything.” Cherise’s cell phone rang musically and she answered, then turned her head away for a little privacy. The conversation was one-sided. Cherise barely said a word but hung up and turned back to Cassie. “Sorry, duty calls.”\n “Brandon?”\n “Uh-huh.” She was standing, clearing the table of empty sugar packets and her cup. “So I’ve got to get going.”\n “He’s in LA?” Cassie just wanted to confirm.\n “Flew in late the night before last, I think.”\n That jived.\n She sighed and rolled her eyes. “He’s not easy to work for, either, but the only other job offer I got was from Whitney Stone, and it didn’t pay as much. She’s working on some shows for a mystery week at a cable company. Even asked about Allie—not just what’s happening now, but what happened in the past, when your mother was stalked by that sicko up in Oregon.”\n Cassie’s heart froze. “She told you that?”\n “She mentioned it just this morning. Can you believe she called me at six thirty? Who does that? Like I would work for a woman that anal. And all of a sudden she has an interest in the nutjob who killed people who looked like Jenna Hughes.” Cherise gave a shudder.\n Cassie’s vocal cords felt as if they’d seized up. She tried to respond, but there was no need as Cherise went on blithely, “All the buzz surrounding Dead Heat must’ve resurrected interest in your mom’s story. Whitney was trying to pick my brain, see if I knew anything, y’know, unique. If Allie had said anything to me. She acted like it was kind of a rush job, said something about already having the footage and wanting to air the program during mystery week. It was a little over the top, y’know. Not that tragedy hasn’t been used as a means to promote a program before.” She glanced at her phone and noted the time. “Look, if I think of anything, I’ll call ya,” Cherise promised, obviously in a hurry. “But don’t hold your breath.” With that she turned and racewalked to her car. She drove off with the same pedal-to-the-metal attitude that she’d come in with.\n It was almost as if she’d met Cassie because of some kind of duty, like getting through a hated obligatory chore. Odd. But the bare fact of the matter was that as refreshing and energetic as Cherise was, Cassie didn’t trust her and felt Cherise might be holding back. Cassie swallowed cold coffee and replayed Cherise’s words. “Not that tragedy hasn’t been used as a means to promote a program before.” Or to promote a movie. Like Dead Heat.\n The gears in her mind ground. Was it possible? Could some of the strange occurrences that had been happening be a means to create a buzz around the film? She was so lost in thought she nearly jumped when she heard someone clear his throat. Looking up, she realized that a twentysomething was hovering nearby, a cup of coffee in one hand, an iPad in his other, waiting for her table. Quickly, she picked up her trash and left the shop. It was after eleven by now and she wondered if, when she got home, Trent would still be waiting. A little jolt of anticipation filled her heart and she told herself she was being an idiot. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3/page-85.html","bookId":2675,"book":{"id":2675,"title":"After She\u0027s Gone (West Coast #3)","description":"Storyline: \n In this explosive new thriller, #1 New York Times bestselling author Lisa Jackson delves into the deep bond between two sisters and their shared dream that becomes a harrowing nightmare of madness, hatred and jealousy… \n Cassie Kramer and her younger sister, Allie, learned the hazards of fame long ago. Together, they’d survived the horror of a crazed fan who nearly killed their mother, former Hollywood actress Jenna Hughes. Still, Cassie moved to L.A., urging Allie to follow. As a team, they’d take the town by storm. But Allie, finally free of small-town Oregon, and just that little bit more beautiful, also proved to be more talented—and driven. Where Cassie got bit parts, Allie rose to stardom. But now her body double has been shot on the set of her latest movie—and Allie is missing. \n Police discover that the last call to Allie’s phone came from Cassie, though she has no recollection of making it. Instead of looking like a concerned relative, Cassie is starting to look like a suspect—the jealous sister who finally grew sick of playing a supporting role. As the tabloids go into a frenzy, Cassie ends up on a Portland psych ward. Is she just imagining the sinister figure who comes to her bedside, whispering about Allie—a visitor of whom there is no record? Is someone trying to help—or drive her mad? \n Convinced she’s the only one who can find Allie, Cassie checks herself out of the hospital. But a sudden slew of macabre murders— each victim masked with a likeness of a member of Cassie’s family—makes Cassie fear for her safety and her sanity. The only way to end the nightmare is to find out what really happened to Allie. And with each discovery, Cassie realizes that no one can be trusted to keep her safe—least of all herself…\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3.jpg","author":"Lisa Jackson","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:33 AM"}}
