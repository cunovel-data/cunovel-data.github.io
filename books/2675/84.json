In shorts and a long-sleeved T-shirt that slid over one shoulder, she was still talking on the phone and seemed oblivious to the other driver’s frustration as she jogged to the front doors.\n By the time she burst inside Cassie was at the front of the line and ready to order. Cherise looked around the busy shop, then racewalked past four other customers. “Grab me a triple shot Americano, okay?” Before Cassie could answer, she added, “I’ll get a table. God, this place is always sooo busy. Oh! There’s one now!” She was off, ignoring the scowls and glares from the people standing in line and hurrying toward a café table being vacated by a couple of teenagers wearing watch caps, army jackets, and shorts while hauling their beat-up skateboards and coffee drinks outside.\n While Cassie ordered, Cherise, as if she’d been a waitress in another lifetime, dropped her phone and keys onto one of the tall chairs, grabbed three sugar packets from a counter, then bussed the trash away. Using a couple of napkins she wiped up spilled coffee and muttered about “lame, self-involved, entitled kids who should be in school,” before spying Cassie with the coffee. “Thanks!” She took the cup Cassie offered and then pulled some one-dollar bills from a pocket in her shorts as if intent on paying.\n Cassie waved away the offered cash. “Next time’s on you.”\n “You sure?” Before Cassie could respond, she tucked the cash away. “Thanks.” Cherise took the lid off her cup and blew across the hot brew, then started opening sugar packets and dumping them in. “I can’t quit thinking about Holly,” she whispered. “Who would do something so awful? And to her of all people? She was so sweet. It doesn’t make any sense.” Stirring the sugar, waiting for it to dissolve, she stared into her coffee as if she could find answers within the dark depths. “Why?”\n “I wish I knew.”\n A fussy-looking woman with pursed lips who had been in line behind Cassie passed by their table and shot Cherise a hard glare. “There are no cuts,” she hissed as if they were in an elementary school lunch line, before bustling importantly out of the shop on wedged sandals.\n Cherise paid no attention to her.\n The line of customers waiting to order waxed and waned while Cassie and Cherise sipped from their drinks and discussed Holly Dennison for a few minutes. Cassie was about to broach the subject of Allie when Cherise asked, “You’re going to the party for the premiere in Portland this weekend, right? It’s kind of a command performance, y’know. A big splash. Dean does it before the release of all of his pictures.”\n “I haven’t thought too much about it. But, probably.” It might be her only opportunity to talk to Arnette and Little Bea.\n “Yeah, me too. It’s too bad Allie won’t be there.” Her smile was pensive. “Maybe she’ll show up by then.”\n “I wanted to talk to you about her.”\n “That’s what Laura said. Have you heard from her?”\n Cassie shook her head. “Not a word.”\n She took another quick sip of her drink. “Me neither.”\n “But you talked to her every day, you knew her schedule in and out. Was anything unusual going on?”\n She half laughed. “There was no usual with Allie. Every day was an ‘experience.’ ” Her amusement faded. “But she was kind of acting strangely, y’know, kind of weird and freaky a day or two before. I mean it wasn’t a big deal, but she was off.”\n “Off? How?”\n “She was just a little . . . tenser than usual. Like edgy, I guess. I didn’t say anything to the police because it was nothing really. It certainly wasn’t anything that made me think something out of the ordinary was going on. Then again with Allie, what’s normal?” Her smile was feeble.\n “What was she tense about?”\n “I don’t know. The movie? Working with Brandon? They were like fire and ice, always running hot and cold. And I can tell you this, he misses her.” She looked quickly away, burying her nose into her cup and taking a swallow.\n Cassie was skeptical of Brandon McNary caring about anything or anyone but himself and his own interests. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3/page-84.html","bookId":2675,"book":{"id":2675,"title":"After She\u0027s Gone (West Coast #3)","description":"Storyline: \n In this explosive new thriller, #1 New York Times bestselling author Lisa Jackson delves into the deep bond between two sisters and their shared dream that becomes a harrowing nightmare of madness, hatred and jealousy… \n Cassie Kramer and her younger sister, Allie, learned the hazards of fame long ago. Together, they’d survived the horror of a crazed fan who nearly killed their mother, former Hollywood actress Jenna Hughes. Still, Cassie moved to L.A., urging Allie to follow. As a team, they’d take the town by storm. But Allie, finally free of small-town Oregon, and just that little bit more beautiful, also proved to be more talented—and driven. Where Cassie got bit parts, Allie rose to stardom. But now her body double has been shot on the set of her latest movie—and Allie is missing. \n Police discover that the last call to Allie’s phone came from Cassie, though she has no recollection of making it. Instead of looking like a concerned relative, Cassie is starting to look like a suspect—the jealous sister who finally grew sick of playing a supporting role. As the tabloids go into a frenzy, Cassie ends up on a Portland psych ward. Is she just imagining the sinister figure who comes to her bedside, whispering about Allie—a visitor of whom there is no record? Is someone trying to help—or drive her mad? \n Convinced she’s the only one who can find Allie, Cassie checks herself out of the hospital. But a sudden slew of macabre murders— each victim masked with a likeness of a member of Cassie’s family—makes Cassie fear for her safety and her sanity. The only way to end the nightmare is to find out what really happened to Allie. And with each discovery, Cassie realizes that no one can be trusted to keep her safe—least of all herself…\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3.jpg","author":"Lisa Jackson","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:33 AM"}}
