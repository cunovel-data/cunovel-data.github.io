Who she was seeing.”\\n\\n “Other than Brandon?” Laura shrugged. “He’s the last one she was really involved with. It made things kind of awkward on the set.”\\n\\n Not exactly news. Cassie had been there. “So what was she thinking before she disappeared? Was she depressed? Anxious? Did you think there was any reason she would take off? Anyone she was scared of?”\\n\\n “Cassie, what do you want from me? If I knew anything about Allie, I’d tell the police or you or Jenna.”\\n\\n “Mom?” That surprised Cassie.\\n\\n “Mothers always worry. So, of course I’d let her know.” She shifted in her chair, as if suddenly uncomfortable.\\n\\n “I didn’t know you knew her.”\\n\\n “I don’t, not really, but Allie introduced me once, on the set. It was obvious that she really cared about her kids.”\\n\\n That much was true. And it was obvious that she and Allie shared enough of a bond for Allie to feel comfortable enough to introduce Jenna to her. Cassie tried again. “Are you sure Allie didn’t say anything to you about what was going on in her life?”\\n\\n Laura checked the time on her phone once more. She seemed to wrestle with her conscience then said, “Oh, hell. Look, I really don’t know much . . .” Again she hesitated, then through the dark glasses her gaze found Cassie’s and her voice was almost a whisper. “What I do know, you’re not going to like.”\\n\\n “What?”\\n\\n “It’s about you, Cassie.” For a second, Laura looked away. “She . . . she was jealous of you.”\\n\\n “Jealous of me?” Cassie barked out a short laugh. “Sure.”\\n\\n “I knew you wouldn’t believe me.”\\n\\n “Allie was successful. On top of the world.”\\n\\n “Was she?” Serious.\\n\\n “Of course she was. She had her pick of movie roles.”\\n\\n Laura let out a sigh. “It wasn’t about her work.”\\n\\n “What then? Why would she be jealous of me?” The idea was ludicrous. Allie had always been the baby of the family and as such, both Cassie and Jenna had protected her in their ways and Robert had coddled her. Allie had shined in school and then later in the same profession where she competed with Cassie, always, always crushing her older sister in any audition.\\n\\n “There’s always been some kind of competition between you two, hasn’t there?”\\n\\n “But she always came out on top. Always.”\\n\\n “I guess it depends upon what you’re vying for.” Laura seemed to become philosophical, her thoughts turned inward. “It happens in every family. My family.”\\n\\n “You have sisters and brothers?”\\n\\n “Not anymore. I had a sister, but . . . she passed years ago. Freak car accident.” She let out a sigh. “I survived. Felt guilty ever since.”\\n\\n “I’m sorry.”\\n\\n “It’s okay,” she said, though she turned a little pensive. “It was a long time ago. But I remember sibling rivalry.” She shot Cassie a look. “It’s never any fun.”\\n\\n “No, but Allie and I . . .”\\n\\n “I just think Allie always wanted what you had.”\\n\\n “But I didn’t have anything . . .” Cassie’s voice faded away slowly. Trent. Allie had never been married. Never come close. Never engaged. A handful of quasi-serious boyfriends, none of which had connected with her until after she’d made her mark in Hollywood, but no one who’d ever wanted to spend the rest of his life with her.\\n\\n “That’s ridiculous.”\\n\\n Laura got to her feet. “You asked. If you don’t believe me, talk to Cherise. She was the one who knew her best, who scheduled her appointments, who knew what Allie was doing, who probably even covered for her.”\\n\\n “Cherise hasn’t returned my calls. I think she doesn’t want to talk to me. Holly said she’s working for Brandon McNary.”\\n\\n “Yeah, I think I heard that, too . . . maybe from Little Bea. I can’t remember, but hey, I really have to go. I can’t help you with Allie.” She was already walking through the doorway into the back of the salon. “I have no idea what happened to her.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3/page-82.html","bookId":2675,"book":{"id":2675,"title":"After She\u0027s Gone (West Coast #3)","description":"Storyline: In this explosive new thriller, #1 New York Times bestselling author Lisa Jackson delves into the deep bond between two sisters and their shared dream that becomes a harrowing nightmare of madness, hatred and jealousy… \\n Cassie Kramer and her younger sister, Allie, learned the hazards of fame long ago. Together, they’d survived the horror of a crazed fan who nearly killed their mother, former Hollywood actress Jenna Hughes. Still, Cassie moved to L.A., urging Allie to follow. As a team, they’d take the town by storm. But Allie, finally free of small-town Oregon, and just that little bit more beautiful, also proved to be more talented—and driven. Where Cassie got bit parts, Allie rose to stardom. But now her body double has been shot on the set of her latest movie—and Allie is missing. \\n Police discover that the last call to Allie’s phone came from Cassie, though she has no recollection of making it. Instead of looking like a concerned relative, Cassie is starting to look like a suspect—the jealous sister who finally grew sick of playing a supporting role. As the tabloids go into a frenzy, Cassie ends up on a Portland psych ward. Is she just imagining the sinister figure who comes to her bedside, whispering about Allie—a visitor of whom there is no record? Is someone trying to help—or drive her mad? \\n Convinced she’s the only one who can find Allie, Cassie checks herself out of the hospital. But a sudden slew of macabre murders— each victim masked with a likeness of a member of Cassie’s family—makes Cassie fear for her safety and her sanity. The only way to end the nightmare is to find out what really happened to Allie. And with each discovery, Cassie realizes that no one can be trusted to keep her safe—least of all herself…\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3.jpg","author":"Lisa Jackson","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:33 AM"}}
