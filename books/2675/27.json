{"id":67386,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"Her heart squeezed a little, but she carried on, noticing, not for the first time, that on every stretch of wall space, pictures of Allie were framed and mounted, the smaller photos collected together, the larger portraits dominating a wall in the dining area or hung over the fireplace. More photos were placed on side tables and shelves, to the point it seemed as if Allie were immortalizing herself in some kind of shrine—an homage to vanity and narcissism. But a few spaces on the wall were empty. Noticeably so. As if taken down. By Allie? Had her sister told Cassie that she was having some of her favorites, the bigger ones, retouched or remounted, that she needed better frames? It seemed so, though Cassie was fairly certain she’d never been in the condo since they’d been taken down. Or maybe the police had needed them, or, more likely, someone on the force had been a fan and helped himself. Whatever the reason, it made her uncomfortable, gave her a weird vibe that didn’t leave.\n Down a short hallway, she entered Allie’s bedroom with its gold star pressed into the door. A joke? Allie’s wacky sense of humor?\n Cassie didn’t think so.\n A messy king-size bed dominated the room. But the mattress had been stripped, the pink and silver duvet with matching sheets gone. As Cassie remembered, there had been a huge array of pillows atop the modern four-poster, but they, too, were missing, probably compliments of the police. Again, pictures of Allie filled the walls, but there were others on the dresser. And possibly some missing. Or was she wrong?\n Several framed shots of Brandon McNary and Allie were on the nightstand and dresser. Cassie studied the photos and wondered if her sister had ever gotten over her costar. Theirs had been a volatile relationship and the tabloids had eaten it up. She, the daughter of Jenna Hughes; he, the only son of a wealthy, southwestern family. Allie had sworn she’d finally broken it off for good, but now Cassie wondered.\n The attached bath was empty and the second bedroom was used as a closet where Allie’s clothes and shoes were stored in massive floor-to-ceiling shelving, drawers, and racks. Positioned near the wide window, with its view of the Hollywood Hills, was a vanity complete with multiple drawers and mirrors that, despite the lights surrounding each reflective panel, could be adjusted to catch the right illumination and offer differing views.\n She sat on Allie’s stool and wondered what it would be like to be the brainy-turned-beauty sister rather than the screwed up one? Catching her own reflection in one of the mirrors that had been turned in, she saw her image repeated and repeated, getting smaller and more indistinct in the echoing reflections until they disappeared in a tiny blur. She was turning away when she saw something in the mirror.\n A shadowy figure loomed behind her.\n Her heart jolted and she jumped, knocking over a glass jar of makeup brushes with her hand.\n Biting back a scream, she twisted to find nothing but a gray curtain draped to the floor. No person. No dark figure. Just an innocuous length of fabric that her willing mind conjured into an evil presence.\n Pull yourself together!\n Shaken, she righted the jar, stuffed the brushes into it, then stood.\n Her cell phone buzzed.\n Heart still pounding she glanced at the number on the screen, digits she didn’t recognize, couldn’t place.\n She let the call go to voice mail as she left Allie’s home with no more answers than she’d had when she’d entered. Making her way to her car, she found a nasty note on the windshield about respecting that the parking spaces were for “tenants only,” then wadded the note and climbed into the car. Geez, she’d been in the spot for less than an hour and someone got pissed? But someone was probably monitoring the surveillance setup in the garage, she thought as she heard the ping indicating she had voice mail. She spied a camera mounted high on a pillar, a red light winking to show that it was monitoring this level of the lot.\n “Fabulous,” Cassie said tightly, and an urgency took over, a need to get away from this place with its dark memories of Allie and the prying eyes of hidden cameras. Shuddering, she zoomed out of the exit, barely braking as she drove her Honda into the street, pigeons fluttering out of her path as she squinted against the high intensity of the sun. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3/page-27.html","bookId":2675,"book":{"id":2675,"title":"After She\u0027s Gone (West Coast #3)","description":"Storyline: \n In this explosive new thriller, #1 New York Times bestselling author Lisa Jackson delves into the deep bond between two sisters and their shared dream that becomes a harrowing nightmare of madness, hatred and jealousy… \n Cassie Kramer and her younger sister, Allie, learned the hazards of fame long ago. Together, they’d survived the horror of a crazed fan who nearly killed their mother, former Hollywood actress Jenna Hughes. Still, Cassie moved to L.A., urging Allie to follow. As a team, they’d take the town by storm. But Allie, finally free of small-town Oregon, and just that little bit more beautiful, also proved to be more talented—and driven. Where Cassie got bit parts, Allie rose to stardom. But now her body double has been shot on the set of her latest movie—and Allie is missing. \n Police discover that the last call to Allie’s phone came from Cassie, though she has no recollection of making it.
