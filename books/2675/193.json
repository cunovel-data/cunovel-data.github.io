And there on the porch, too near to her for comfort, was Rinko. Had he followed her here? God, the kid was weird.\\n\\n “Hey!” a female voice called, and she turned to spy an attractive woman of about twenty standing under the archway. She walked into the room and offered a smile. “You’re Allie Kramer, aren’t you?”\\n\\n “Yes,” Allie said, relieved that someone recognized her. From the corner of her eye she saw Rinko moving stealthily, trying to get out of the room. She ignored him. “And you’re?” she asked the girl with the sad eyes.\\n\\n “I’m new. A transfer,” she explained. “And my name’s Shay.”\\n\\n Rinko, standing behind the newbie paused and looked over his shoulder. He gave his head a slight shake, a warning, as he stared at Allie. She felt as if a ghost had crawled up her spine. What was that all about?\\n\\n “So,” Shay said, commanding Allie’s attention again, “I hope we can be friends.”\\n\\n “Sure,” Allie agreed and slid her gaze to the spot where Rinko had been standing.\\n\\n But he was gone. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3/page-193.html","bookId":2675,"book":{"id":2675,"title":"After She\u0027s Gone (West Coast #3)","description":"Storyline: In this explosive new thriller, #1 New York Times bestselling author Lisa Jackson delves into the deep bond between two sisters and their shared dream that becomes a harrowing nightmare of madness, hatred and jealousy… \\n Cassie Kramer and her younger sister, Allie, learned the hazards of fame long ago. Together, they’d survived the horror of a crazed fan who nearly killed their mother, former Hollywood actress Jenna Hughes. Still, Cassie moved to L.A., urging Allie to follow. As a team, they’d take the town by storm. But Allie, finally free of small-town Oregon, and just that little bit more beautiful, also proved to be more talented—and driven. Where Cassie got bit parts, Allie rose to stardom. But now her body double has been shot on the set of her latest movie—and Allie is missing. \\n Police discover that the last call to Allie’s phone came from Cassie, though she has no recollection of making it. Instead of looking like a concerned relative, Cassie is starting to look like a suspect—the jealous sister who finally grew sick of playing a supporting role. As the tabloids go into a frenzy, Cassie ends up on a Portland psych ward. Is she just imagining the sinister figure who comes to her bedside, whispering about Allie—a visitor of whom there is no record? Is someone trying to help—or drive her mad? \\n Convinced she’s the only one who can find Allie, Cassie checks herself out of the hospital. But a sudden slew of macabre murders— each victim masked with a likeness of a member of Cassie’s family—makes Cassie fear for her safety and her sanity. The only way to end the nightmare is to find out what really happened to Allie. And with each discovery, Cassie realizes that no one can be trusted to keep her safe—least of all herself…\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3.jpg","author":"Lisa Jackson","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:33 AM"}}
