Her eyes met Cassie’s in the mirror and she physically started. “Wait a second, you’re Allie Kramer’s sister, aren’t you? How could I not put two and two together? You really look like your mom.”\n “So I’ve heard.”\n “Hey, I’m sorry . . . really sorry about your sister, I mean.” She shook her head and reached for a comb. “I don’t suppose anyone has any idea . . . ?” She left the sentence unfinished as if she were unsure how much she could ask.\n “No,” Cassie said, not wanting to go into it with a virtual stranger. Besides, she was on edge, well, more on edge than usual, especially with Trent in her house. The thought of him hanging out in her apartment without her bothered her and she mentally kicked herself again for handing over her key so readily.\n “Bummer.” Verna was already touching Cassie’s hair, pulling it away from her head, testing it as an assistant came by with the offer of drinks, everything from herbal tea to regular coffee and cucumber water.\n Cassie declined. She’d just come here for information, but it seemed her idea had been foolish.\n “You know, I think some red streaks would be cool,” Verna was saying. “Nothing too noticeable. Maybe a deep burgundy or an auburn with a kick would brighten this up. Be nice on you. Kind of contempo.”\n “Just a trim.” Her hair wasn’t the issue.\n “Okay,” Verna agreed with a smile as she met Cassie’s gaze in the mirror again. “You’re the boss.”\n This was turning out to be a big waste of time. Verna knew nothing. Of course. In the end, Cassie ended up with slightly shorter hair and a lot less cash in her wallet, but she hadn’t found out anything about her sister.\n Once again, a dead end, she thought as she found her way out of the building and slid a pair of sunglasses onto her nose. What had she really thought she’d accomplish? She didn’t know the first thing about locating a missing person. She should just leave Allie’s disappearance to the police. Let the professionals handle it.\n And who are they considering their number one suspect in her disappearance? You.\n As she reached her Honda, a BMW tore into the lot, wheeled into one of the few open spaces, and in a chirp of tires stopped short. The driver’s door flew out and Laura Merrick, blond hair streaming behind her, oversize sunglasses covering her eyes, practically leaped from the car. “Oh, God, Cassie! I thought I might still catch you,” she said breathlessly. “I mean I was hoping. Did you hear?”\n “Hear what?” Cassie asked, instantly panicked. Allie! Oh no. It’s Allie. Something awful has happened!\n “About Holly Dennison.”\n “Holly? No . . . I just saw her.”\n A pause. “When?”\n “The other night.”\n “Not last night?”\n Cassie shook her head. “What?”\n Laura took in a breath, then said, “She’s dead.”\n “Dead?” Cassie said, her insides going cold. Holly? Bubbly, full-of-life, Moscow-Mule-pushing Holly? “No.”\n “It’s true. I just heard,” Laura said, shaking her head in disbelief.\n “Then you must’ve heard wrong.” But the expression on Laura’s face said it was true. Cassie went from denial to despair. Could it be? She felt the blood draining from her face and the warm sun beating against the back of her neck.\n “Her body was found this morning. Outside a bar in . . . in, oh, God, I can’t remember, no . . . somewhere in Venice, I think. It . . . it doesn’t matter.” Laura ran her hands through her hair. “I need a cigarette.” She looked pointedly at Cassie.\n “I don’t have any.”\n “Really?”\n “Never smoked.”\n “Figures. Well, come on, Verna or maybe Alana might.” She saw that a couple of potential customers had stopped to listen to their excited conversation, and she grabbed Cassie by the arm. “No reason to make a scene.” Quickly, she propelled Cassie back through the shop, stopped at Verna’s station where, after a quick exchange, she was handed a French cigarette, then she hurried them both through a supply area and break room with a coffeepot and mini fridge to a small outdoor space facing an alley. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3/page-80.html","bookId":2675,"book":{"id":2675,"title":"After She\u0027s Gone (West Coast #3)","description":"Storyline: \n In this explosive new thriller, #1 New York Times bestselling author Lisa Jackson delves into the deep bond between two sisters and their shared dream that becomes a harrowing nightmare of madness, hatred and jealousy… \n Cassie Kramer and her younger sister, Allie, learned the hazards of fame long ago. Together, they’d survived the horror of a crazed fan who nearly killed their mother, former Hollywood actress Jenna Hughes. Still, Cassie moved to L.A., urging Allie to follow. As a team, they’d take the town by storm. But Allie, finally free of small-town Oregon, and just that little bit more beautiful, also proved to be more talented—and driven. Where Cassie got bit parts, Allie rose to stardom. But now her body double has been shot on the set of her latest movie—and Allie is missing. \n Police discover that the last call to Allie’s phone came from Cassie, though she has no recollection of making it. Instead of looking like a concerned relative, Cassie is starting to look like a suspect—the jealous sister who finally grew sick of playing a supporting role. As the tabloids go into a frenzy, Cassie ends up on a Portland psych ward. Is she just imagining the sinister figure who comes to her bedside, whispering about Allie—a visitor of whom there is no record? Is someone trying to help—or drive her mad? \n Convinced she’s the only one who can find Allie, Cassie checks herself out of the hospital. But a sudden slew of macabre murders— each victim masked with a likeness of a member of Cassie’s family—makes Cassie fear for her safety and her sanity. The only way to end the nightmare is to find out what really happened to Allie. And with each discovery, Cassie realizes that no one can be trusted to keep her safe—least of all herself…\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3.jpg","author":"Lisa Jackson","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:33 AM"}}
