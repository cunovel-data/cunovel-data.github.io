{"id":67496,"no":137,"title":"Page 137","content":"Leaning back in her chair, Nash squeezed her eyes shut, then whipped her head around, cracking her neck. After eight or nine hours at her desk all of her muscles were tight, a headache beginning to pound at the base of her skull. She felt a second’s relief before her muscles clenched again.\\n\\n Her eyes burned from hours reading through files and notes, doing research on the computer, and just plain lack of sleep. In the early morning hours, once she and Double T were finished at the crime scene, she’d known she was too keyed up to go home and try to get a few more hours of shut-eye, so she’d driven directly to the office. The predawn hours had been quiet, the department nearly empty, so she’d taken the time to compare every detail of the murders of Holly Dennison in LA and Brandi Potts here, in Portland.\\n\\n So many similarities.\\n\\n So many loose ends.\\n\\n With only the weakest of connections.\\n\\n Her headache was starting to throb.\\n\\n It didn’t help that over the last few hours the office had become a madhouse with officers, suspects, and witnesses coming and going, the shuffle of footsteps and buzz of conversation accompanying them. Telephones jangled or blipped out messages, a printer or fax machine was endlessly chunking out pages near the reception area, and from every direction the frenetic click of keyboards could be heard. Despite the soundproofing of the movable walls, the department as a whole was a cacophony of sounds, all of which, today, permeated the insulation to reverberate in Nash’s skull.\\n\\n She found a bottle of ibuprofen and washed down two capsules with the dregs of her cold coffee. Her damned phone hadn’t stopped ringing since seven this morning and as the day had worn on and news of the latest homicide had hit the Internet, the phone calls had only gotten more frequent.\\n\\n For her part, she was pushing the lab for immediate results, asking for a priority on Brandi Potts’s autopsy, wanting comparisons of the bullets found in each of the victims, needing to know if there were any fingerprints or DNA left on the masks. The ME had complied, the bullet that had buried deep in Brandi Potts already retrieved.\\n\\n So far today Nash had been contacted by five different reporters, all of whom she’d referred to the Public Information Officer. A few tips were coming in as well, some about the shooting, and, of course, the usual Allie Kramer sightings.\\n\\n If I had a dollar for every time someone thought they’d seen the missing actress, I’d be rich, she thought, and knew it would only get worse. As the release date of Dead Heat got closer, the number of calls from people who claimed to have caught a glimpse of the missing star had seemed to increase exponentially. The press had gotten wind of that little detail too, all of which had created some weird macabre buzz about the film.\\n\\n Allie Kramer.\\n\\n Her disappearance was at the heart of this, Nash was certain, she just didn’t know how. But a prime opportunity to question witnesses was at hand. Tomorrow night. The all-star bash for the movie’s premiere. People involved with the movie and the party had been flying up and down the coast. Los Angeles to Portland and back again. Nash had checked.\\n\\n So it wasn’t as if Cassie Kramer were the only suspect, just the most visible at this point in time.\\n\\n Nash stood and stretched, loosening her muscles, but her mind was still on the case. She could believe that Cassie might have been involved in the disappearance of her sister, they had a documented volatile relationship, but why kill the other women? Was she really that far around the bend? Is that why they were decorated with distorted visages of the women closest to Cassie? Did she have to mock their relationships by scribbling them on the back of the mask? Did she need to kill Jenna and Allie over and over again and use other women even slightly associated with them as her victims? What kind of psychosis was that?\\n\\n It just didn’t quite fit. Not in Nash’s mind.\\n\\n At first Nash had thought Brandi Potts had no connection to the other women and the filming of Dead Heat, but that wasn’t exactly true. As it turned out, when Potts’s boyfriend, Jeffrey Conger, was interviewed and asked, he’d said that Brandi had been an extra in the movie, in fact she’d been on the set the day that Lucinda Rinaldi had been shot, but, no, he didn’t think she knew either of the Kramer sisters. Of course he’d been broken up at the time, woken from a deep sleep, to find out that his live-in girlfriend wasn’t just not in their shared condo, but that she was dead, killed by an unknown assassin. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3/page-137.html","bookId":2675,"book":{"id":2675,"title":"After She\u0027s Gone (West Coast #3)","description":"Storyline: In this explosive new thriller, #1 New York Times bestselling author Lisa Jackson delves into the deep bond between two sisters and their shared dream that becomes a harrowing nightmare of madness, hatred and jealousy… \\n Cassie Kramer and her younger sister, Allie, learned the hazards of fame long ago. Together, they’d survived the horror of a crazed fan who nearly killed their mother, former Hollywood actress Jenna Hughes. Still, Cassie moved to L.A., urging Allie to follow. As a team, they’d take the town by storm. But Allie, finally free of small-town Oregon, and just that little bit more beautiful, also proved to be more talented—and driven. Where Cassie got bit parts, Allie rose to stardom. But now her body double has been shot on the set of her latest movie—and Allie is missing. \\n Police discover that the last call to Allie’s phone came from Cassie, though she has no recollection of making it. Instead of looking like a concerned relative, Cassie is starting to look like a suspect—the jealous sister who finally grew sick of playing a supporting role. As the tabloids go into a frenzy, Cassie ends up on a Portland psych ward. Is she just imagining the sinister figure who comes to her bedside, whispering about Allie—a visitor of whom there is no record? Is someone trying to help—or drive her mad? \\n Convinced she’s the only one who can find Allie, Cassie checks herself out of the hospital. But a sudden slew of macabre murders— each victim masked with a likeness of a member of Cassie’s family—makes Cassie fear for her safety and her sanity. The only way to end the nightmare is to find out what really happened to Allie. And with each discovery, Cassie realizes that no one can be trusted to keep her safe—least of all herself…\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3.jpg","author":"Lisa Jackson","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:33 AM"}}
