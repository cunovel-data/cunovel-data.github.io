{"id":109700,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"CHAPTER FOUR\\n\\n She\u0027d watched dawn come in as she lay on her sofa, glad that she\u0027d been able to get the family to give in to her need to be alone despite the attack. There was no reason for them to worry about her falling asleep. Fat chance of that after everything had jumped off. Add a serious case of bad nerves to the fact that she had been up almost all night with them, deep in strategy at the dining room table, her not being alert should have been the least of their worries. She needed space to think.\\n\\n By the time she\u0027d dragged her weary, ragged body home, fending off complete protest from the team, she was simply ready to drop. She\u0027d thought she\u0027d never get out of there, though, when Yonnie allowed his voice to descend to a purposeful octave and calmly asked if she wanted an escort home. Not.\\n\\n The .only reason she didn\u0027t make a big production out of telling him to back off was that Tara would have been embarrassed, and this was just some Yonnie, master vampire, bullshit to get under her girlfriend\u0027s skin in front of Rider, who apparently had an attitude about Tara\u0027s glimpse at both Rider and Carlos. But the team bugging hard about it had frayed her last nerve.\\n\\n The point everyone seemed to miss was as long as Carlos was handling his business, Yonnie would never step to her, out of respect and because he and Carlos were fam... But if Carlos ever stopped handling his business, well... It was the way of the vamp world. That was what had bristled Tara, and the message Yonnie was trying to send - that he had options. Both of them were crazy.\\n\\n Oh, yeah, there had to be some seriously dark energy afloat. Damali rubbed her eyes and tried to wake up fully. But personal issues, lusts, struggles, whatever, paled in comparison to what they were up against. She had to remain clear about that.\\n\\n After the conversation with Father Patrick, she didn\u0027t have enough energy to try to wrangle with the Neteru Queens. But once she recharged her mental battery, she\u0027d try to make contact with Nzinga to learn more.\\n\\n Bottom line was, she had to figure out how to locate Lilith and the Chairman. Up till now, she really hadn\u0027t been hunting them; she\u0027d just been trying to heal herself and her team. She now wondered how much of that was because of the dark energy that had been released, and it made her question whether or not she\u0027d been wrongly focused on her own immediate concerns, versus her overall mission as a Neteru. Had her plan been logical - retreat and get strong, then get back into the fight?\\n\\n That\u0027s what unnerved her, not knowing if her logic was sound, her strategy tight. She was now also beginning to question her intense desire to live away from the team. Was that just a normal evolution of her growth as a woman and a Neteru, or something motivated by deep, hidden, selfish reasons?\\n\\n She let her breath out hard and closed her eyes. What she\u0027d seen and had come to learn now made sense. She kept reminding herself not to be judgmental. Father Patrick had said this open portal mess with bad vibes floating around affected everyone differently.\\n\\n First things first: get Carlos up and sober, then fill him in. Rider and Shabazz had committed to getting him up and pouring coffee into his gullet. Mike and Inez had to be found, and they had to get on a flight back home, and once home, get debriefed. Salt supplies had to be reinforced to do roofs, windows, doors, and the house perimeter - a FedEx shipment was on the way from Stateside clerical Covenant contacts.\\n\\n They still had to figure out a way to lock in on the Chairman, and for that, Carlos Rivera had to be in his clear and present mind and stop avoiding his role as a pivotal team seer. But now that the team knew what it was up against, sensing for it would be a little easier. Maybe.\\n\\n The new day\u0027s light hovered over her like the comfortable old blanket she\u0027d curled up under on her living room couch. She rubbed her cheek against it.\\n\\n Slowly sitting up and then standing, Damali allowed the blanket to trail behind her as she walked to the bathroom to splash water on her face and brush her teeth. She didn\u0027t bother to turn on the light and draped the blanket around her shoulders like a poncho as she stared into the mirror. She hadn\u0027t even taken off her clothes and was still wearing the bright orange T-shirt and faded jeans she\u0027d had on the night before.\\n\\n Weariness made her limbs heavy. She padded quietly toward the kitchen in her socks. For all the protest about needing her personal space, it had always been her intention to christen her brand-new bed with Carlos. Then the walking dead had showed up at her door. A real groove buster.\\n\\n A hot mug of tea was in order. By rote, she reached up into her brand-new cabinets, found a box of green tea, and began preparing a mug by drizzling raw honey over the organic tea bag and then flipping on the burner beneath the kettle. All of a sudden she smelled metal and snatched the kettle off the flame.\\n\\n Oh, yeah, water. Everything was brand-spanking new. Nothing in her new house was old and worn and comfortable or broken in, except. Jose\u0027s blanket.\\n\\n Angry hisses and sputters sounded from the sink as Damali turned on the faucet and filled the kettle, then stood by the stove, watching the blue flame tickle the bottom of it. Too much heat without enough water... Leo flame hadn\u0027t respected the Scorpio water. Carlos had a point; she wasn\u0027t big on the solitude of majestic Arizona, either.\\n\\n Soon steam rose from the small hole in the kettle\u0027s spout, letting out a soft whistle. The fusion of heat and water had changed the two elements into something else. It created a sound - a high, whining rush of transformation. She turned off the burner. What was she missing? she thought as she dunked the teabag in and out of the water.\\n\\n Pulling her blanket closer around her, she walked through the kitchen to the back deck. She needed air, to be outside. Probably as much as Carlos needed his own environment, something familiar, something that gave him some measure of control over whatever was going on in his life. Here, he didn\u0027t have that.\\n\\n Footsteps down the side path made her straighten her body, wipe her face angrily, and spin on the intruder.\\n\\n \"Yo, D,\" Jose said. \"You okay?\" He hesitated and looked at her tear-streaked face. \"After last night, and a lot of the things you told us while Carlos was passed out cold... I was worried.\" His gaze sought hers and trapped it. \"And, if Yonnie happened to fall by to try to mess with your head while you had a lot on your mind, I brought my crossbow to stake his ass in lair in the morning. Hope you don\u0027t mind.\"\\n\\n She nodded and then laughed self-consciously through the tears. \"I move around the corner, and still nobody knocks?\" She was glad that he smiled, because the statement wasn\u0027t meant as a dig, just a friendly tease. She made a fist and raised it toward the sky. \"It\u0027s a Navajo-Latino thing, and I wouldn\u0027t understand. It\u0027s cultural - on the Navajo side, no one owns the land, so it\u0027s cool if you just roll up on \u0027em as long as they\u0027re outside. On the Latino side - why use a phone when you can just fall by and see if a sistah is home?\"\\n\\n Jose\u0027s smile widened. \"Yeah, and a sister got her cultural ways, too. She woulda hollered in my window by now, if I had my own spot - talking about, \u0027Yo, Jose, wanna go kick some sounds? I got this song in my head! Wake up!\u0027 \"\\n\\n \"Oh, now, see - you wrong, Jose!\"\\n\\n They both laughed as she ran toward him and gave him a big hug.\\n\\n \"I miss you already,\" she said, laughing harder as he hugged her tighter. His faded blue plaid shirt and rumpled jeans were a sight for sore eyes.\\n\\n \"You my boo, girl. We should be down at the beach, eating some tacos, Rollerblading, hanging.\"\\n\\n \"Clubbing!\"\\n\\n He held her away from him with a wide grin. \"D, don\u0027t tease me like that. This town has one bar with sawdust on the floors, one movie theater, one good diner, one freakin\u0027 grocery store, but five ammo shops!\"\\n\\n \"And you\u0027ve gotta drive fifty miles to hit a Wal-Mart to buy some drawers,\" they said in unison and laughed.\\n\\n \"Brother, I ain\u0027t trying to look a gift horse in the mouth or talk about your people\u0027s land, but - \"\\n\\n \"D, it\u0027s a one-horse town. You ain\u0027t gotta tell me.\"\\n\\n Again they laughed, and she slung her arm over his shoulder like old times.\\n\\n \"Remind me why we came here again?\" Damali said, giving Jose a wink.\\n\\n \"Something about some vampire friends of yours,\" he said, laughing as they made their way back into the house.\\n\\n \"Oh, so now it\u0027s on me?\" Damali stopped in the kitchen and folded her arms.\\n\\n \"Yep, fearless leader. See, me, I woulda risked the hotel circuit till we could build in Malibu or Beverly Hills or some-freakin\u0027-where other than here.\"\\n\\n \"Stop lying, Jose,\" she said, laughing harder. \"How were we gonna keep all the kids in the house, straight and safe?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Mommy dearest,\" he said, bowing his head slightly, then looking up with a mischievous smirk. \"But in a minute, they\u0027re gonna get one helluva education all cramped in that rickety house of Pop\u0027s.\"\\n\\n Damali cocked her head to the side. Jose laughed and ran his palm over his hair.\\n\\n \"Your girl made Big Mike some ribs the other night before they announced another Houston trip, and uh - \"\\n\\n \"Noooo...\" Damali covered her mouth.\\n\\n \"Shabazz been in there doing Kung Fu on tables and shit,\" Jose said, laughing. \"Anything wood is fair game for a brother\u0027s tension. Lost sections of the dining room in the backyard. So when Mike split, him and Mar was out a few nights ago. Marlene and Shabazz left this morning, too. You been missing a lot of drama while being over here checking on contractors, fixing stuff up, and then when you finally pulled out of the minicompound all hell broke loose.\" He laughed harder. \"I don\u0027t know where they are now, truthfully. After you ran it all down and left, we started losing household. Guess everybody needed somewhere to go chill.\"\\n\\n She covered her face and laughed out loud. \"Oh, my God!\"\\n\\n \"Berkfield ain\u0027t no punk, either. Rolled right after Shabazz and Marlene got ghost.\"\\n\\n \"Marjorie and Richard split and left their kids? You have got to be lying!\" Damali walked in a circle, the blankets swishing behind her like a royal robe. \"Everybody\u0027s all right, though? Nobody\u0027s seen anything weird and been touched by anybody outside of the house, right? For real, Jose.\" Her laughter had gone, her expression was tight.\\n\\n \"Naw,\" he said, giving her a hug. \"They cool. Just blowing off steam like we always do before going into another big battle.\" He chuckled low. \"You know that gladiator-type shit... good meal, good woman, good night\u0027s sleep, then get strapped and go to war.\"\\n\\n She immediately relaxed and put her head on his shoulder. Jose\u0027s warmth felt so good, just like his hands against her back did. \"All right. I\u0027ll stop being mother hen.\"\\n\\n \"Good,\" he murmured, rubbing her spine. \"You\u0027re too tense, though I can understand why.\"\\n\\n \"You always make me feel better when crazy shit is going down,\" she said, sighing from the knots he was unfurling in her back. \"Damn, that feels good.\"\\n\\n He breathed out a contented sigh, and the warmth of it rippled through her hair. \"It\u0027s all good, D. You ain\u0027t hear this from me, but earlier this week, Rider put a rifle on his lap while we was all playing cards and gave J.L. the eye. Gave him the don\u0027t-try-it-while-her-pop-is-out big-brother thing, feel me? That old equipment shed behind the house got stories we\u0027ll all take to our graves, but if J.L. had lost his mind and taken a walk in the moonlight with Miss Kris, and Rider had been roasted enough to try to stop a martial artist on a mission - hey, he mighta whupped Rider\u0027s ass. The house is a powder keg, D. I think the only thing that kept J.L. chill was the girl\u0027s brother ain\u0027t warmed up to the concept yet, and Dan has Bobby\u0027s back - so.\"\\n\\n \"Lawd have mercy.\" Damali shook her head and left Jose\u0027s loose embrace to go turn on the kettle again. \"See, that\u0027s why a sistah had to be out.\"\\n\\n \"I can dig it,\" Jose said with a smirk. \"Don\u0027t worry about your boy, Carlos, either. Rider had his back. That\u0027s why I came by, so you wouldn\u0027t worry. Brother is still fell out on the porch swing and sleeping it off, so like I said, it\u0027s all good.\"\\n\\n The mirth peeled away from her once more. Oh, no, not yet. They had been back, the old them, now the moment had evaporated like steam.\\n\\n While she appreciated Jose\u0027s update on Carlos\u0027s whereabouts, she really wasn\u0027t ready to interject that into the happiness he\u0027d brought through her door. Mention of Carlos meant that she had to think about the thing she was trying not to think about. In a roundabout way, Jose had given her a full account of where everybody had been, except he and Juanita... Not that that was her business. And then she\u0027d have to think about all sorts of other things, which returned her to the concept of sharing, which she\u0027d successfully banished for five minutes of free thought. So she did what Marlene always did when the subject matter got thick, made tea.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got green, mint, uh, strawberry, echinacea, uh, golden seal, and - \"\\n\\n \"Mint\u0027s cool, but you got any Joe in the house?\"\\n\\n \"Coffee, oh, yeah, sure. I forgot that you and Rider don\u0027t do herbals first thing, uh, not sure where it is, umm...\" She sounded like a mad hatter, and knew it, but couldn\u0027t stop herself as she banged open cabinets and shut them, moving in jerky, confused, starts and stops.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s cool, D,\" Jose said, his voice mellow and amused as he neared her. \"It really is cool.\"\\n\\n His hands on her shoulders stopped her desperate search for coffee grounds. It stilled her body, but made her mind fly out of her ears and her heart nearly pound out of her chest. A simple nod without turning to face him was all that she could manage, and she understood what he meant by it all being cool - problem was, it wasn\u0027t.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad you liked the blanket,\" he said quietly, his body close enough to hers to allow her to feel the heat of it adding to the blanket in its own distinct layer. \"I kept it on my bed for years... and, uh, wanted to give you something that always comforted me when I was alone.\"\\n\\n Oh, shit, she was gonna have a heart attack. No words formed in her mind or her mouth. Her vocal chords were frozen. She could only wrap the blanket closer to her body to both stave off the shiver his statement had produced and to acknowledge how sensual an act giving her the blanket had been. It was a profound gift, something to be cherished, and it had been offered with enough measure of respect, without totally crossing the invisible line. But the gesture was also beginning to print a license for him to do that. All those nights when he\u0027d wanted her... wrapped in this... Didn\u0027t he understand that she was also a tactical sensor! His hands on her shoulders and touching the threads, was making the fabric practically come alive around her like a caress. Plus, hombre had a little vamp in him, too... Oh, Lord... Everything she was feeling the night before while standing in front of the refrigerator was waking up inside her.\\n\\n \"D, I have a confession to make,\" he said quietly, \"and I hope you won\u0027t be mad at me.\"\\n\\n She swallowed hard and was barely breathing. His hands trailed down her arms, but he might as well have run them down her back.\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t have stopped by if I thought Carlos was here... I mean, unannounced like this.\"\\n\\n She closed her eyes. \"I know,\" she whispered.\\n\\n He leaned his chin on her shoulder, his warm breaths coating her neck, making small tingles run down her spine and setting a slow smolder to her throat. He smelled clean, masculine clean, with an Ivory Soap foundation that she\u0027d just begun to notice. She stood there, immobile, separating the scents of him in delicate layers. Mint mouthwash, Ivory Soap, shampoo, male chemical pheromone... Until this moment, she hadn\u0027t really understood just how sensual a creature Jose was... at least not the way he was making her understand it now.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know how to say it,\" he murmured and then sighed.\\n\\n She kept her back straight and her body extremely still, not sure whether she should melt into the invitation and close the sliver of space between them. She struggled with a response. She couldn\u0027t say that honesty had always been theirs, because they\u0027d been lying about this very thing to each other, as well as to themselves, for years. The word trust came to mind, and she seized upon it.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve always been able to trust each other,\" she finally whispered, \"even when we weren\u0027t sure of anything else.\"\\n\\n He nodded and laid his cheek on her shoulder to replace his chin, and wrapped his arms around her to gather her hands where she clutched the blanket. His fingers twined with hers and he let his breath out hard again. \"I love you, D...\"\\n\\n Her response was a thick swallow. Oh, shit ...\\n\\n \"Like in a way I can\u0027t explain... it\u0027s that trust thing you said. I want us to stay friends, like the way we were just laughing outside. Do you know what I mean?\"\\n\\n She opened her eyes wide, glad he couldn\u0027t see the shocked expression on her face. Friends. Friends? Yeah, cool, right, exactly. Friends were a good thing, this was a friend-loving-closeness-hug, not a man-soon-to-be-a-lover-in-about-two-seconds-hug... Oh, my God, she would have been too embarrassed. The portals needed to be vacuum sealed, not just closed, if the mess had her acting like this!\\n\\n \"See, I know, from time to time, things between us would kinda get thick, and that was my fault,\" he said quietly on a soft expulsion of air. \"D, I\u0027m sorry I took you there and made you uncomfortable in the house, ya know?\"\\n\\n She nodded quickly. \"No, it\u0027s cool, Jose, we - \"\\n\\n \"No, girl,\" he said gently. \"Let me finish and get this out, once and for all.\"\\n\\n Damali pressed her lips closed and stared wide-eyed at the cabinets.\\n\\n \"I just have so much fun with you, we click so good together, when we make music, compose, do the stage it\u0027s like... like I can\u0027t even talk about it. And we know each other so well... like we can finish each other\u0027s sentences, and, God knows, you\u0027re beautiful... But I had to get over it. You didn\u0027t feel that way toward me. Carlos was the only brother that made you feel that, and I had to respect that. Had to suck it up. That was my own head-trip, and I was about to lose somebody real important in my life because I couldn\u0027t accept the way things were. In fact, he\u0027s cool people, too. I was about to create some drama in the house, and half of me was wondering if I was what made you move so you didn\u0027t have to deal with that. I\u0027m sorry, if I put you in a position. That\u0027s what I truthfully came by to tell you, since you were all alone in here and we could really be real.\"\\n\\n He lifted his head and turned her around slowly to face him. Her eyes sought the floor, but he put a finger under her chin to lift her head.\\n\\n \"D, if I was the reason you moved out, come home once the compound is built and there\u0027s real living space. If not, cool. But if I had anything to do with it, I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n She shook her head no, too rattled to immediately say a word. \"No, Jose, it wasn\u0027t your fault, and there\u0027s never been a reason for you to apologize to me about anything. I moved out because it was just time, ya know? I\u0027ve never been on my own and wanted to see what that felt like.\"\\n\\n He smiled and kissed her forehead. \"Sometimes it\u0027s good, sometimes it\u0027s bad. Sometimes it\u0027s fun, and sometimes it\u0027s lonely as shit. Like everything else, it ain\u0027t perfect.\"\\n\\n She gave him a platonic hug and shooed away the heat that he still produced in her body. The daggone blanket was cursed. She smiled inwardly. Nah, it was blessed. It was her crazy brain that was twisted.\\n\\n Jose awkwardly pulled away and turned off the burner on the stove. \"Kettle\u0027s been singing now for about five minutes.\"\\n\\n Damali glanced at it, feeling warmth creep to her cheeks. \"My bad?\"\\n\\n \"I know,\" he said with a wry smile. \"I didn\u0027t hear it, either.\"\\n\\n They looked at each other, a silent understanding passing between them.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s time to turn the flame down before the kettle burns.\"\\n\\n She nodded and slipped around him to find two clean mugs. Oh, shit. She nodded as she walked. \"Good idea. Oh, yeah, you wanted coffee. Ummm... where did Marj put - \"\\n\\n \"You got a pop or some iced tea?\"\\n\\n She stopped, looked at him, and went to the fridge. \"I drank out of this,\" she said quickly and shoved the iced tea back onto the shelf. \"But - \"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s fine,\" Jose said, leaning against the sink. \"I\u0027ll share your spit while you share my blanket.\"\\n\\n She held the iced tea midair. \"You want a glass?\"\\n\\n \"Do I need one?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n He stopped smiling for a second, took the pitcher from her, and turned it up to his mouth. After a long swig, he shoved it back into the refrigerator and wiped his mouth on the back of his shirtsleeve. \"We do it like this in the house behind Marlene\u0027s back any ole way.\" Then he burst out laughing.\\n\\n She was so shocked that it took her a second to laugh with him. It wasn\u0027t the tea confession that had paralyzed her; it was all the double meanings and the sheer sensuality of the way he\u0027d done it, like a quiet striptease. His vamp roots were showing; all that was missing was a little hint of fang. She couldn\u0027t tell if he was just messing with her or serious, but the whole thing jacked with her mind. Laughter was a good cover and a good release, just as it had always been between them. She made herself laugh very, very hard.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d better go,\" Jose said, still chuckling. He kissed her cheek and began walking through the house.\\n\\n \"Tell everybody I said hi.\"\\n\\n \"Yep,\" he said, and gave her a wink. \"Maybe if I go back to bed, I won\u0027t be put in the doghouse.\"\\n\\n Damali straightened, every hair on her neck bristled. \"Oh, puh-lease,\" she said as upbeat as possible. \"Who\u0027s gonna put you in the doghouse?\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Nita. Just promise me you won\u0027t floss that blanket around her, okay? I know y\u0027all have beef, but do that for me to keep the peace, boo? She\u0027s still a little salty about the fact that I insisted you have it, since it came off my bed... Women can be so superstitious and territorial, but, uh, it\u0027s cool. However, there\u0027s a limit to what y\u0027all will and will not tolerate, and a brother being AWOL first light, is one of \u0027em.\" He kissed her quick and winked at her again. \"I\u0027m out.\"\\n\\n She waved, smiled, even laughed a little, and then leaned on the doorframe and watched him jog down the path, but he picked up the pace to a flat-out haul-ass once he hit the road. That annoyed her to no end. He was running for Juanita so the heifer wouldn\u0027t be pissed. Damali briefly closed her eyes.\\n\\n She had to let it go. But at this insane moment she didn\u0027t want to share him, at least not his laughter, or whatever. Then, she had to get real.\\n\\n He\u0027d braved being cut off and returned to monk status; he\u0027d brought her his blanket, dashed to her house at dawn to deliver a message... five miles down the road, no car to wake up the house.\\n\\n This was private, between them, another gift to be tucked away in her mental cedar chest, black box. This same man had let fate cut out his heart, but still was a soldier. This same man had ridden like a bat out of Hell on a bike to save her from said same. This man had handed her a pile of ashes when it really mattered most, an act that he knew would probably change his world - but he did it anyway. He\u0027d allowed her team to build a life on his land... had provided always when it counted most... didn\u0027t come home drunk. He\u0027d sipped her iced tea, shared spit and shared a blanket, said he loved her, added the caveat about being her friend to keep it smooth, and then walked. Went home to where he was supposed to be, and didn\u0027t make a false move. Damn... what a man. Juanita had better recognize. That shit Jose just pulled had wet her drawers. If that girl ever broke his heart... Oh, no, Juanita had better be clear; Jose was a gift from God.\\n\\n With an exhausted sigh, Damali hugged the blanket closer and simply allowed herself to feel just a little bit sad.\\n\\n She went into the house, glanced around at the open, bright space, and still felt like she was imprisoned. She couldn\u0027t run far or fast enough from the feelings that had shaken her. As long as there was evil on the planet, she would never find peace. Peace was a hard commodity to come by, just like privacy and a chance to explore new things like a normal human being was... and the right to make a few mistakes along the way.\\n\\n In this very moment, she hated sharing her entire life with the planet. Jose had made her wonder what it might be like to do something truly selfish, just for a little while.\\n\\n Damali quickly banished the thought, but it crept back slowly, regardless. Maybe it was the effect of everyone living in close quarters for months? The house down the road had been a real nightmare of too many people under one roof. That had to be part of it. Everything had been so crazy it was laughable. Almost. She walked through her small house, picked up her mug, added fresh hot water to it, and went out onto the back deck to stare at the surrounding mountains. Her head felt like it was about to explode.\\n\\n Marlene and Shabazz had one bedroom; Mr. and Mrs. Berkfield had the other. The team had quickly constructed two triple-level bunk beds and wedged a cot into one room for the guys. Necessity was the mother, or father, of invention and was all that was available for the formally unpaired men in the house, so that Carlos, J.L., and Jose could be on one side of the room in a bunk, Big Mike, Dan, and Bobby Berkfield could be on the other, with Rider\u0027s cot wedged against a wall in the submarine-size enclave. Ridiculous.\\n\\n A brawl was imminent, if things didn\u0027t change. It wasn\u0027t much better for the ladies\u0027 room. She and Inez had been bunkmates, like an adult summer-camp arrangement, while Juanita and Kristen shared a double bunk bed.\\n\\n True, that wasn\u0027t as intense as the guys\u0027 room, but the claws came out after the first week. What was personal space? They might as well have rented out a matchbox, and after a while, everybody gave up protecting their small spot of territory. Sharing, coping, having one\u0027s space invaded were constants; missing clothes, toiletries, combs, and brushes were standard. A black hole in the universe opened and swallowed things in the confusion. It was impossible to find anything, forget about going out unwrinkled or a quick change, and one virtually had to take a number and wait in the hall to pee. If you got hot water, you had to say thank you, Jesus. The guys gave up shaving, unless it was on the back porch using a coffee mug, hand mirror, and good judgment.\\n\\n Sharing was the watchword of each and every day. Damali sipped her tea. What the heck were they being prepared for now? Or was this it - the prelude to something even worse, like living in caves of huddled humanity during a planetary wipeout from On High? Anything this intense was always a sign. If they closed the portals, delivered the book, and got the job done, then what? There was always a reason more than the obvious.\\n\\n But that was just the problem; she didn\u0027t feel like sharing, especially if the future looked so grim. Damali sipped her hot tea more deeply and watched the steam from it curl up from the surface with fury. As far back as she could remember she\u0027d had to share everything.\\n\\n While in foster care, she\u0027d had to share clothes - hand-me-downs to be more exact. She\u0027d had to share someone else\u0027s parents. Ultimately, when she\u0027d run away, she had to share a sofa in Carlos\u0027s mother\u0027s home, and Lord knows share a bathroom, share chores, meals, the one telephone in the house, share all. Then the Guardians found her, and she had to share living space to a point beyond ridiculous. Had to share all her hopes and dreams and aspirations with the public through her music, and share her life and fate with the greater good of the world as a Neteru. Had to share her privacy with relentless, hounding media. She wasn\u0027t even going to think about the money they all shared. That was the only thing she didn\u0027t mind putting into the communal pot.\\n\\n But there were some things that were still so difficult to share, like Marlene\u0027s attention and affection, the only real mother she\u0027d ever known, was once all hers... after Christine became Raven. But now Marlene was to be shared by new, younger Guardians�and whatever was left was split between Shabazz and worry for Kamal. That was okay, she supposed. However, a sigh still brushed past her lips as she blew on her tea to cool it. At least Kristen still had her mom. For all her kooky, overzealous ways, Marjorie Berkfield was a good mom to have.\\n\\n Her best girlfriend, Inez, was shared with a baby - but she\u0027d never lost her friend in all that. Inez was always available to laugh and talk with, even if she\u0027d never before told Inez about her crazy life. That was not what they shared; it was the love. A pure girlfriend-to-the-bone love that was very distinct from Marlene\u0027s mother-love, which never competed with the baby\u0027s needs - they both loved Inez\u0027s tiny boo.\\n\\n Yet it was so odd that, with the little one safely stashed in Houston at Inez\u0027s mom\u0027s new place, and even living under the same roof with her best cut-buddy on the planet - who now knew all, and knew why she\u0027d never been told about her secret life before, she felt further away from Inez than she ever had. Inez was now shared with her Big Mike, and although she was happy for both of them, she missed Mike\u0027s hugs, his doting concern, and most assuredly his laughter that now seemed reserved for Inez. Mike had been her big teddy bear. Now, she had to give him up to \u0027Nez.\\n\\n Truthfully, all her brothers had been shared away... J.L. was now Krissy\u0027s, Dan and Bobby were best buds; Shabazz and Berkfield were ironically getting tight as the two most-married men in the house with live-in wives. Marlene and Marjorie had that to share between them. Inez and Big Mike had the new bloom of love. Rider had a pain so deep that he nursed it in a bottle of Jack Daniel\u0027s... so gone were the days of the two-by-two details and solo talks they\u0027d shared. And then there was Jose.\\n\\n She tucked the thought closer to her as the wind caught the end of her blanket and made her hold it more firmly. She did not feel like sharing him, with of all people, Carlos\u0027s old girlfriend. She missed Jose enough to bring tears.\\n\\n Morose thoughts continued to fill her head as she quietly sipped her tea and looked out toward the vast canyon walls. Why couldn\u0027t Carlos understand that she\u0027d needed the space to think all this out? She\u0027d shared her mind with Carlos, her body with him, even her heartbeat and her soul. All she was asking for was a little time to make the mental transition to sharing the rest of her life with him. First, before she did that on a permanent basis, she\u0027d wanted to see what it was like to not have to share every fiber of her being with someone. She had no concept of what it might be like to keep a little of self in reserve. Up till now she\u0027d been a love-to-the-bone, give-it-up-to-the-bone, max-it-out kinda sister.\\n\\n There had to be a way to find herself within all the layers of the shared one. Now the Covenant was telling her for real to share the world, and her man was drunk as a skunk, and she couldn\u0027t even share the burden with him.\\n\\n It brought tears to her eyes to realize just how angry she was at him for being messed up at a time like this, even though, she knew it was irrational to feel that way. She just couldn\u0027t help it.\\n\\n Sometimes there were so many people and priorities pulling on her, demanding a part of her that she felt schizophrenic or like she had multiple personality disorder. She didn\u0027t want to feel stressed like that when she became Mrs. Carlos Rivera. So, today, and for as many days as it took to reintegrate into a sense of balance, she wasn\u0027t sharing her living quarters. At least she could demand to keep her body to herself for a little while.\\n\\n \"Shoot,\" she said quietly toward the canyon. \"I even shared my damned Isis long blade with a brother and lost it, for all the good that got me - giving up throat. Was I crazy?\"\\n\\n Damali shut her eyes, becoming peevish at the memory of having the old Neterus strip her of the only thing that seemed to truly be hers. The dagger being returned was a consolation prize, to her mind. But the memory of the long blade made hot tears rise to wet her lashes.\\n\\n She\u0027d even had to share her child with another female\u0027s womb... then subjugate her natural instinct for the good of the world to protect it, and cut what had once been hers out of Lilith\u0027s foul body.\\n\\n Damali hurled her mug of tea over the deck rail. \"Don\u0027t you ask me to share another fucking thing!\" she shouted and then began to sob. Oh, yeah, whatever had begun to seep into the earth\u0027s atmosphere was strong. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-damned-vampire-huntress-legend-6/page-5.html","bookId":2530,"book":{"id":2530,"title":"The Damned (Vampire Huntress Legend #6)","description":"Storyline: The Damned (Vampire Huntress Legend #6) \\n Damali Richards knows all about a blood rush.
