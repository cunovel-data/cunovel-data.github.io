Stiffness riddled his body and connected to the pounding in his temples. He couldn\u0027t immediately open his eyes and face the blast of Arizona sun. But the fact that it was hard to breathe made him struggle to sit up.\\n\\n Carlos eased open one eye and peered at a blurry image before him. Faded Navajo hues went in and out of focus. Rider was sitting on the steps, his head down and face hidden beneath a weathered, brown ten-gallon cowboy hat. An Indian blanket was wrapped around him, but didn\u0027t fully cover the rifle on his lap. Rider\u0027s chest rose and fell slowly with the steady rhythm of slumber.\\n\\n As soon as Carlos stirred, Rider\u0027s index finger twitched against the gun trigger. He lifted his head slowly and stared at Carlos.\\n\\n \"Not bad for a tired old man.\"\\n\\n \"Not bad at all,\" Carlos said, his voice coming out like a frog\u0027s croak.\\n\\n \"I had your back,\" Rider said, and then reached behind the post he was leaning against to retrieve a bottle of Jack Daniel\u0027s. He opened it with one hand, screwing the cap off with two fingers while pushing the bottle between his thighs.\\n\\n Carlos shielded his eyes from the sun with his hand. \"What time is it?\"\\n\\n \"Morning,\" Rider said bluntly. \"And too damned early for me to be drinking, so I\u0027ve heard.\" He shook his head and smiled, and offered the bottle to Carlos. \"Ain\u0027t for me. It\u0027s for the snake that bit ya.\"\\n\\n Carlos wanted to nod, but couldn\u0027t. The thought of moving his head brought tears to his eyes. He leaned forward by raising only his shoulders off the swing, and extended his arm to receive the bottle, wincing from the slightest exertion.\\n\\n Just the smell of alcohol made him want to wretch, but he leaned over the side of the swing and took a shaky sip of it anyway. The moment the liquor hit his lips, it burned, and the hard swallow sent an acidic scorch over his tongue and down his throat to smolder like liquid fire in the pit of his stomach. Two seconds later it was back up again, along with everything he\u0027d ingested the night before.\\n\\n He held on to the wicker, shuddering, heaving, his eyes closed, upchucking his guts, sweating, while Rider calmly struck a match and lit the end of a cigarette. Smoke curdled the smell of vomit under his face and set off a new wave of nausea until all he could do was dry heave.\\n\\n \"Marlene\u0027s method of cleansing takes too long,\" Rider said, once Carlos had flopped back onto the swing. \"I\u0027ll get it before the flies do, sometime later today.\"\\n\\n Carlos lay on his back, breathing hard in short bursts, willing away the nausea. He didn\u0027t know whether to thank Rider or to attempt to jump up and kick his ass. \"Thanks, man,\" he finally said between pants, opting for the more reasonable choice.\\n\\n \"Like I said, I had your back.\" Rider stood slowly, took another drag on his cigarette, and shook his head as he looked down at the porch.\\n\\n \"Damali call you?\" Carlos asked with his eyes still closed.\\n\\n \"Nah. Could smell you coming from half a mile away. Burnt ash and booze. Figured you and me had a lot in common.\"\\n\\n Carlos attempted a slight nod, but didn\u0027t open his eyes.\\n\\n \"I used to show up at this very house like that,\" Rider said in a wistful tone, moving downwind from the putrid mess Carlos had delivered on the porch.\\n\\n Carlos winced and pushed himself to sit up. \"I\u0027ve gotta get this up before Marlene freaks.\"\\n\\n \"She ain\u0027t here, so no rush,\" Rider said coolly.\\n\\n His mind wasn\u0027t making synaptic connections, and it was hard to judge time. Scratching his head didn\u0027t help jump-start his brain. All he could imagine was that it had to be late, if Mar wasn\u0027t around. \"Well, if Mar won\u0027t bug, Marjorie sure will.\"\\n\\n \"She ain\u0027t here, either,\" Rider said calmly, sitting on the rail on one haunch and flicking ashes over it. \"I\u0027m babysitting today.\"\\n\\n \"Huh?\" Carlos groaned, and finally swung his legs over the edge of the wicker swing, avoiding the throw-up by his feet.\\n\\n \"Well... it\u0027s like this,\" Rider said in a weary tone, inhaling slowly and making the red embers at the end of the cigarette glow. \"Last night, after the group powwow, which I\u0027ll fill you in on in a moment, Miss Inez, as you recall, had left her usual kitchen magic under aluminum foil before she\u0027d gone out of town again, made all these vegan dishes that Marlene has been insisting on. Actually, they were pretty good reheated. But then the girl messed up and made a rack of ribs with a side of potato salad to go with the greens and cornbread, especially for Mike - which is what sent Mike on a mission to Houston with her in the first place. Now what\u0027d she do that for, I ask?\"\\n\\n Carlos laughed, even though he had to hold his skull with both hands to do so. \"Oh, shit. Chain reaction.\"\\n\\n Rider flicked his near-dead cigarette butt over the rail with two fingers. \"Kaboom. How long did it take Mike to be out and hop a flight to Houston with Inez?\"\\n\\n Carlos smiled even through the pain.\\n\\n \"I know you\u0027re still in hurtin\u0027 from a night out with the fellas, but I want to elaborate on the chain-reaction theory. Now, as you remember, dude cleaned off the last bone, dropped it in his plate, girlfriend reached for it to take it back into the kitchen - next thing you know, Mike stood up, grabbed his Hummer keys, and asked Inez to walk him to his vehicle. Ain\u0027t seen \u0027em since. But I don\u0027t think even a werewolf would mess with him last night.\"\\n\\n \"No doubt,\" Carlos said, and leaned back against the furniture to keep the porch from spinning.\\n\\n \"Next thing you know, after our late-running convo last night, Shabazz was saying, \u0027Mar, can I talk to you for a minute?\u0027 You know how smooth he rolls - made it seem like they needed to convene about the situation at hand, and those two were out the back door. Not sure if Marlene zapped them into another dimension or what, but they ain\u0027t home.\"\\n\\n Carlos didn\u0027t say a word and just stared at Rider and then closed his eyes again.\\n\\n \"Berkfields broke camp, too. Dude stood up, got a gun and his keys, and said, \u0027Marj, let\u0027s go.\u0027 Didn\u0027t think the man had it in him.\" Rider laughed.\\n\\n \"She went, just like that?\" Carlos was incredulous, and it made him open his eyes to squint at Rider.\\n\\n \"You missed it,\" Rider said chuckling. \"Her face got all flushed, and she hovered around the children, giving them instructions on what to do, her cell phone number, and then looked at me with these puppy dog eyes, and I knew I was the babysitter. So, I holstered up and told her I\u0027d slow down on the Jack and things would be fine.\" Rider sighed. \"But not before I laid a hand on J.L.\u0027s shoulder. That\u0027s when Berkfield nodded and walked out the door.\" He smiled at Carlos. \"Some things don\u0027t need to be said. They just boil down to a man-to-man understanding.\"\\n\\n Carlos knew exactly what Rider meant. \"Listen, the thing last night with my boy...\"\\n\\n \"I understand,\" Rider said. He looked down at the vomit. \"No blood in it, so I reckon you\u0027re fine.\"\\n\\n \"No, man, that\u0027s not what I\u0027m talking about.\"\\n\\n \"You staggered your ass up these steps with my help, starting at twenty-five feet out in the front yard, and fell down so hard on the swing that somebody shoulda yelled timber. I\u0027ve been there. Gets cold outside at night in the desert, so I threw a blanket over you. Every now and then I\u0027d put my eye on ya, only because you were tossing and turning so much, like a man with a lot on his mind�and I didn\u0027t get concerned until I saw a little fang crest... but, hey, it\u0027s daylight so I didn\u0027t dust you in your sleep. The fact that you actually did go to sleep at night helped me put things into perspective.\"\\n\\n Rider pulled out another cigarette and allowed it to dangle from his lips as he searched for his matches again. \"Me, Dan, J.L., and the kids had a great night of poker.\"\\n\\n Carlos didn\u0027t respond for a moment. Several things were competing for dominance in his cloudy mind. He noticed, too, that Rider hadn\u0027t mentioned Juanita or Jose\u0027s whereabouts. The one thing he knew for sure was that what was said openly was as important as what wasn\u0027t said at all. He also hadn\u0027t mentioned Damali. Big, obvious oversight. Major.\\n\\n \"You need to stop smoking, man. Not like I can tell you what to do, but that\u0027s like slow suicide, and I don\u0027t wanna see you go out like that.\"\\n\\n \"Appreciate the sentiment,\" Rider said, allowing a slow release of smoke to filter out of his nose. \"Guess we\u0027re all prone to relapse.\" He stared at the end of the cigarette. \"Haven\u0027t done this in almost thirty years, but a lot of things are working my nerves.\"\\n\\n Carlos let his breath out hard and shut his eyes again. \"I hear you.\"\\n\\n \"Do you?\" Rider said coolly.\\n\\n \"Yeah, I do.\"\\n\\n \"Let me explain something very slowly, then,\" Rider said, easing off the porch rail and stretching his back. He glanced at the rifle that was leaning against a post. \"Me and the old guard have approximately one more month to finish training you, right about when your house will be finished, and then you\u0027ll be a full-fledged Neteru. What you do with this second chance is your business. I\u0027m a very simple man, with very simple requirements to live. I understand vices and make no judgments about what other folks do. I\u0027ve accepted my fate. I don\u0027t ask for a lot; I\u0027m very philosophical in that way. At my age, I avoid unnecessary stress; I don\u0027t battle over bullshit. But every man has his limit.\"\\n\\n Carlos stood with effort and went to find a mop. Nothing more needed to be said to Rider, except maybe thank you.\\n\\n Rider looked at him hard when he returned to the porch. \"Did you or did you not hear me say we had a powwow, once? A meeting, twice?\"\\n\\n Carlos just stared at Rider for a moment. \"Everything\u0027s fuzzy, man.\"\\n\\n \"Then, you need to clear up your head, pronto. Damali was here, after a demon attack.\"\\n\\n Carlos dropped the mop.\\n\\n \"Father Patrick said call on a seer-lock. Airwaves are compromised.\"\\n\\n Carlos sat down slowly.\\n\\n \"Your homeboy, Yonnie, watched the front yard, while Tara stayed on the porch to protect you... in case whatever tried to smoke Damali came for you - but let me add that the Neteru apex you\u0027re beginning to trail sent a little red through her eyes. So, I sat out here with both of them,\" Rider said, his voice tightening and escalating with every word, \"to keep you from being turned into a Third, and then subsequently getting your heart ripped out by your best man, if she couldn\u0027t help herself!\"\\n\\n Carlos squinted as much from the volume of Rider\u0027s voice as from the scenario he painted. What Rider had endured was too insane. \"Man, I\u0027m so - \"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t fucking say it!\" Rider shouted, pointing at Carlos. \"Damali was in there locking with Mar to see about the fate of the world. I\u0027m out here babysitting you while watching my woman, who has already gone off with another vamp bastard, try to sip air and be cool in both his and my presence! We got kids in the house, and some crazy bullshit on our asses. Maybe a compromised werehuman out in the woods nearby, a Zen master that knows this and is ready to turn the house out if Marlene breathes wrong - while my ace, Big Mike, who can body slam anything, is out in Houston eating barbecue and getting laid!\"\\n\\n \"Rider, man, lower your voice. I hear you,\" Carlos said, holding his head.\\n\\n \"Lower my voice? Lower my voice!\" Rider hollered, walking in a circle with his arms opened wide. \"What the fuck is going on, I ask somebody! Our primo sensor, smooth operator, the one who knows all this demon realm shit like the back of his hand, is dead damned drunk - and so pitifully so - that a master vampire can give Damali a nod with full fangs in his mouth and ask her if she wants a lift home?\"\\n\\n \"What?\" Carlos tried to stand, but had to sit back down.\\n\\n \"Damali is gonna have to fill you in, or Father Pat - somebody�because right now, I lack the patience!\"\\n\\n Rider punched a porch post and walked back and forth. Carlos held both sides of his skull and tried to stop the reverberating gong Rider\u0027s bellows created.\\n\\n \"But, I\u0027ma tell you this, captain. The girl was angry. Had a right to be. Don\u0027t take that shit out on Yonnie, you deal with it�because Yonnie did what any male of any species would do, all right. He saw an opportunity. Damali was spittin\u0027 nails, she was so furious. There was something lurking out there - she got one of them - her dead foster father and - \"\\n\\n \"What?\" Carlos whispered, allowing his hands to drop away from his skull.\\n\\n \"I take it you know the import of that?\"\\n\\n Speechless, Carlos couldn\u0027t even nod.\\n\\n \"Yeah. That\u0027s why Yonnie offered her a master vamp transport lift home with the caveat that, if she wanted, he\u0027d hang around till dawn as her personal bodyguard. He was gonna do the invitation by mind lock, seeing as how we were all on the porch, by the time she was ready to leave... and Tara was there. But, Damali said no, so he had to just put it out there and see if she\u0027d take the bait. Now you can evaluate that however you\u0027d like.\"\\n\\n Rider stared at his hands, using them as invisible scales in the air. \"One way, a man could say, my friend is honorable. I\u0027d do no less. On the other hand, one could say, I played myself. Girlfriend is old enough to take a nick and still do daylight. She killed a predator, but her emotions were raw and vulnerable last night, and I was out cold.\"\\n\\n Both men stared at each other hard.\\n\\n \"You better get real clear this morning,\" Rider said in a mercifully quiet voice. \"You\u0027ve got a family, a post to man, and responsibilities. There were kids in the house, what if one of them was yours?\" He sighed wearily, but his tone held no apology in it. \"Me, yeah, I\u0027m probably an alcoholic, I\u0027ll accept the title. But I\u0027m a very functional one. So, know this. I\u0027m never away from my post when I\u0027m supposed to be there. There is no old buddy from my old days in the streets that can come into this family unit and pull me outta here and get me to the point where I imperil my own.\"\\n\\n Rider leaned against the post and looked at the mess on the porch floor. \"Except Tara. Yeah, I screwed around and got more than nicked. But I even let her go, my heart, so I wouldn\u0027t come back in here one night and not be myself - you got that?\"\\n\\n \"Rider, man, listen... I - \"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want that sonofabitch on this property. Period. I do not ever want to have to babysit your ass for the bottle or any other vice, not if you\u0027re gonna take equal partnership to lead this household. Period. If one Neteru goes off shift, the other one goes on�and when y\u0027all can find time to do what you\u0027ve gotta do, somebody\u0027s fucking radar better be turned on, because, if you haven\u0027t noticed, the Levels are consolidating power, heat in the system is ramping up.\"\\n\\n \"I know, man, but - \"\\n\\n \"No, you don\u0027t know jack! My old friends had bad habits, too, dude. Mike ain\u0027t on our shit list, because he informed us where he was going, when he was going, and when his flight touches down this afternoon, he\u0027ll be lucid. Your ass, most likely, ain\u0027t gonna dry out for another twenty-four hours. I\u0027ve got a cell phone number to everybody else that rolled outta here this morning. Even if their cell phone vibrates so hard it gets up and walks across a hotel night-stand, I can raise a lucid Guardian within an hour, the moment they catch their breath and say their last \u0027I love you, baby\u0027 - you hear me? Your days of being absent without leave all night and coming back fucked up and needing to regen for twelve hours of daylight are over.\"\\n\\n Carlos let his breath out hard and leaned on his forearms.\\n\\n Rider lit another cigarette. \"Stupid as it sounds,\" he said, dragging hard on the butt and exhaling rage \"with the smoke, \"I almost kinda liked it better when you were all vamp. Was easier. We knew what to expect, and the one thing we could always count on was nothing would roll up on Damali and possibly take her out. You were on the case. Wouldn\u0027t even let us do anything that could put her in harm\u0027s way. You were the fortress, man.\"\\n\\n \"I liked it better that way, too, hombre,\" Carlos muttered. \"You just don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, well, pull your shit together and stop bellyaching,\" Rider said, his glare focused on the walkway and he drew in another hard drag that hissed. \"I liked it better when I was twenty-five years younger. Liked it better when I could take one of Tara\u0027s Fourth-gen nicks... Oh, yeah, there were things I liked so much better than this current state of affairs I find myself in - like babysitting a new male Neteru who has yet to get his head screwed on straight. I bet Shabazz liked it better, too, when Kamal was in Bahia, but he ain\u0027t. Guaranteed Berkfield liked it way better when he was just a cop, and wasn\u0027t policing demons away from his daughter or watching her about to get her bones jumped by our team\u0027s computer whiz kid. But shit happens. Things change. You find yourself in new circumstances, and gotta cope. Grow up and take a number. Everybody on this team has something they liked or wanted way better than this.\"\\n\\n Rider flicked away the half-smoked butt and looked at Carlos without blinking. \"By rights, I should be the one who was lying passed out on that swing. If you had any sense, you would have been the one over there at Damali\u0027s new place, no matter what she\u0027d said, talked your way into her door - like the master you used to be, and made the best of the new circumstance. You\u0027ve got opportunity and gifts you\u0027re not even using, brother. The thing that\u0027s kicking my ass is, of all the people on the team, if you would get the spirit of this change together, you could have it all like it used to be... You\u0027ve got the money, the girl is still crazy about you�don\u0027t ask me why. All the newbies hang on to your every word. Had Dan reaching for reasons why you were out cold.\" Rider pulled his fingers through his hair and hocked again.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a lot of things that are real different, man, that are hard to explain.\" Carlos scanned the horizon. There was no way to capture it all on the porch.\\n\\n \"My simplistic trailer-park-roots advice is this. Don\u0027t allow time to pass and wind up living on that swing, because your boy bested you at your own game, or a Guardian brother just happened to be in the right place at the right time... or we go do a job in some foreign land and she rolls up on one of the one-hundred-and-forty-four-thousand Guardian options out there and makes a decision because they had their heads on straight and you were off the job. The quicker you let go of what was old and figure out how to work with what\u0027s new, the better.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to go do some target practice, something useful and productive that\u0027ll keep my skills sharp and keep me out of the doghouse, to release some of my old tensions,\" Rider said with sarcasm. \"I had your back, last night. Still got it, but the Yonnie thing worked my last nerve. I need to go shoot something.\"\\n\\n Carlos looked up slowly. A combination of emotions tore through him. Rider was pissing him off, but truth resonated within every angry word. Guilt lacerated him. Rage shook him. Worry made him weary. Damali\u0027s state of mind and what he\u0027d missed while out sent dread and a spike of adrenaline through his every cell. Then the layers and degrees of all of those things, plus so much more, began to peel and blister. Humiliation was in the mix; he just couldn\u0027t separate it out from the rest.\\n\\n Rider nodded toward the mess on the porch and began walking down the steps. \"You need to clean up your own shit before the young bucks and the women see it, dude. Stop wallowing in your own crap. Find out what the new mission is from somebody that has patience, I\u0027m not the one today. Call the priest, whatever. Then go down the road and fall on your sword like every man has to do when he fucks up real bad. It\u0027s simple.\"\\n\\n Carlos stood watching Rider\u0027s back as he trudged down the path, kicking up dust before rounding the house. What was there to say? He sent his line of vision on the horizon and squinted and then stared in the direction of Damali\u0027s new house.\\n\\n Was it any wonder that she was lukewarm about getting married and wasn\u0027t ready to tie the knot legally, on hallowed ground? He\u0027d felt it before, but knew it now. Rider hadn\u0027t lied. Could he blame her? Damali had waited all her life for this?\\n\\n Carlos glanced over his shoulder at the puke on the porch and frowned. For all he knew she, by rights, might be blaming him about her losing the baby. Or, maybe it was the way they just weren\u0027t the same when together... like that last time together in Philly could still be in her head - he was angry, she was angry, and he\u0027d never touched her like that in his life... nothing had been right since that.\\n\\n The insane part was, he didn\u0027t even know where to begin to make that up to her. Or maybe it was simply the Light being too done with him. After Lopez, he could understand why Heaven would be fed up enough to make Damali turn away from him for good.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Carlos whispered, closing his eyes to the too-bright sun. Maybe it was all of it, or none of it. For the first time in his life, he wasn\u0027t sure what to do, and she wouldn\u0027t even really talk to him... kept everything to surface bullshit. At the same time, he was just as guilty, because there was no way he could honestly talk to her about this.\\n\\n He just shook his head, which made him wince. Damali had actually gone down to square off with the Chairman like he should have... She ran the team better than he probably ever would. She knew the Neteru code cold. She had met with her queens and they\u0027d offered her swift guidance, when his kings had simply marked him and left him to figure life out on his own.\\n\\n Plus, she\u0027d shape-shifted so smoothly that it gave him chills when she went from black adder to panther, and had held Hell in check until she hit multiple targets with authority. Damali was moving up in skill and rank, while he was on the bottom rung of becoming whatever he was supposed to be. Rank busted. What was he supposed to do with that? More important question: What would she wanna do with that? With him?\\n\\n No doubt about it, she was evolving into something more spectacular than she\u0027d already been and was in full control, total command, just like he used to be. He was proud of her, but the joy was bittersweet... just like she\u0027d crooned to all the masters in Sydney, it was a bittersweet transition, from time to time.\\n\\n Even up in Gabrielle\u0027s establishment, Damali had to show him how to get back on his horse and ride... and the way she\u0027d bent light up his spine and had him close to pure ether... There were no words for it. Girlfriend was bad. She had to be simply tolerating his ass these days.\\n\\n That was unforgivable; not her actions, but his. No wonder she didn\u0027t feel like it, all their love notwithstanding. Familial love was something real different from Eros, any fool knew that. So when she says, \"I love you, baby,\" what does she really mean? he wondered. Which kind? General, like family, or specific, like you\u0027re my man? But that was a stupid mental question, because what had he put down with authority lately?\\n\\n Skills all fucked up, head jacked, powers shaky... Shit, he couldn\u0027t stand his damned self, why would his woman? So, no, it was better that they didn\u0027t try to mind lock. Maybe they both had enough sense to know that they might find out some real deep shit that neither of them was ready to address.\\n\\n Carlos hung his head. Every part of his body felt like he\u0027d been beat down. He missed it all, and couldn\u0027t lie to himself or the Light about that any longer. He missed everything, the old nights, to be more precise... damn... when a throne gave him absolute power and control over everything in his world. A time when he could walk through walls, bulk to beat down any predator, step to any challenge... with strategy like a razor, game to the bone. Variables, not a problem - he could work four corners of a room with unparalleled mastery, because he was a master. He could blow Damali\u0027s mind and show her some shit she had never seen before, and leave an echo print on her soft skin that would make her holla just from the heat of his breath against it. Those nights were gone. He had to suck it up and deal with his new reality, or new sentence.\\n\\n He thought for sure after he\u0027d been shown some new shit by the old boyz in Ethiopia, and then on the road, things would go back to the way they were. But how did he begin to deal with the fact that now he was always two steps behind her, instead of leading the charge?\\n\\n Damali had taken to the Light like a fish to water; he\u0027d been dragged into it kicking and screaming and was currently drowning in it. The Light had blessed her with radiant beauty and unstoppable power; it had stripped his ass bare and bled him out, as far as he was concerned. Fair exchange. His baby had rolled on Level Six, pure gangsta. He\u0027d seen her do that cold-blooded shit with his own eyes, which had left him both proud of her, but fucked up behind it. The combination was unsettling. Somehow that was different from what she\u0027d done in McGuire\u0027s castle, because at the end of the night, then, he was still Councilman Rivera... he owned all the territories in the world, and had worn her beautiful ass out lovely in the desert.\\n\\n \"Ain\u0027t that always the way,\" Carlos absently muttered as he began cleaning up the porch, tying everything he\u0027d been thinking about into a tidy military-style bundle to clear away.\\n\\n Yet, a jumbled, tangled pile of thinking lay at his feet. He might as well have dumped his dresser drawers and tried to quickly shove everything back into them. Same process. Once everything was out, one had to deal with every individual item, carefully lift, handle, and fold each piece, quite a process if the furniture was overstuffed from the get-go. His black box was. He hated cleaning out his box as much as he hated his turn doing team laundry and cleaning up the aftermath of a night out with Yonnie. It was sloppy.\\n\\n Carlos glimpsed the mop with sudden disdain. The mundane had claimed him. He had been given the gift of life, but from all indicators, he was still trapped in another world, one of mediocrity, filled with senseless struggles that caused nothing but heartbreak. Yeah, he was still serving time, more like marking it than living it. Cool. He\u0027d figured it would go that way - maybe he\u0027d traded a living hell for a dead one. He\u0027d amassed enough debt for either side to make said point.\\n\\n \"Es decepcionante.\" Very disappointing, indeed. Carlos glanced through the screen, hoping nobody would come outside to see him at the messy task of cleaning away what he\u0027d upchucked. What he had now were spotty powers that worked when they felt like it, and a family to care for when he couldn\u0027t half take care of himself.\\n\\n And what about the vamp females that would inevitably come out of the shadows when he reached his apex for real? What then? He was supposed to be this millennium\u0027s male Neteru, but wasn\u0027t even sure he could take down one vicious vamp female and dust it if it rolled up on him in the midnight hour; but he knew Damali could. He\u0027d seen her nearly smoke four vamp bitches with their masters present. So now Damali was his bodyguard?\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t supposed to be like this. He couldn\u0027t even look at her, right through here, and abruptly trained his line of sight on the horizon, remembering the freedom of wingless flight. Mist. Smooth exit. Except that wasn\u0027t an option this morning.\\n\\n To his mind, there was just a certain way things should be done. The complex problems really had simple solutions, but the whole issue of souls and their metric weights added variables that frankly seemed to cause more confusion. The angels knew everybody in Hell was double-dealing, so why didn\u0027t they just come down, go prang, and fix this shit with the quickness? He knew the Light had awesome veto power, but the way they used it just strung his brain out.\\n\\n That was something he definitely had to ask Father Pat one day. He had questions like, why all the riddles, intrigue, mayhem, and choice drama? Lucifer had aces and nonsense up his sleeve, so the other side, to his thinking, should just do the damned thing and straighten out the madness. Zap that bastard, too, while they were at it, and be done.\\n\\n He\u0027d had this partial conversation about the use of power when the Covenant had first rolled up on him in a parking lot at Nuit\u0027s building. What now felt like a long time ago seemed to be a simpler time, too. Just whack one slimy mofo and save his woman angst. But even then the Covenant couldn\u0027t negotiate directly with him to cut a deal. They had to take it higher up, and wait for a long decision. Whereas the side that shall remain nameless seemed to work on a different timetable. Instant gratification.\\n\\n Like, in the old nights, he could have solved Rider\u0027s problem with one feral elevation nick, and made him a master so his woman would never stray again. Rider was drinking and smoking himself to death anyway - there were viable options... if one wanted to get technical. It wasn\u0027t his first choice, but he was sure if he was in a position to make a tender offer to a man slowly losing his mind over something like that, hey, the thing would be simple. He knew Rider well enough to know that if the shoe were on the other foot, hombre would be down to do whatever needed to be done. That\u0027s what he liked about Rider - the man was practical, a realist, said what others were too chicken shit to say. He respected that.\\n\\n They could have discussed it over Jack Daniel\u0027s, shook on it, and the deal would have been done. It wasn\u0027t about allowing a respected amigo to suffer. Rider was grown; one allowed a grown man to choose his own way out. At least that\u0027s how it was done where he was from... East L.A., by way of Mexico, and a small pit stop along the way. But topside or sub, you didn\u0027t leave your tight homeboy to twist and have his heart butchered slowly by memory Harpies or his guts pulled out by shit too hard to digest. A favor was in order, for a real good friend caught between a rock and a hard place. De nada. Same night. Right on the spot when he and Rider stood up from their bar stools.\\n\\n How different was what he proposed from watching a fellow soldier blown half to bits, still alive, guts lying everywhere... no chance of recovery, and begging for a bullet in the temple to stop the pain? Done quietly on the battlefield every day with honor.\\n\\n Carlos shrugged and glanced up. No answer. His solutions spiraled darker as he continued to think about it all and mop off the porch.\\n\\n To keep the peace, since they were family now, and a strong family was a necessity in any realm, he would have given Yonnie enough playmates to take the sting out of the loss... he\u0027d get over Tara with the replacements he could have made for his main man. Then, by rights, he woulda backed Kamal up to an appropriate distance so Kamal could get his head straight and go home, and Marlene could relax enough that Shabazz could stand down without losing face. Respect for the family\u0027s Aikido master and their philosopher extraordinaire coulda stayed chill. That was power.\\n\\n There was a way to do everything, and a way not to. That\u0027s how he saw it. Regardless of the Light, all of this was sloppy. \"I ain\u0027t trying to offend,\" he said quietly, talking to the porch floor. \"I just don\u0027t understand.\"\\n\\n \u0027Cause he mighta been able to share a little suave with Dan, so the young buck could go pull a superfine babe older than Krissy, get laid on the regular by a double-D-cup blonde, and stop wigging every time Berkfield\u0027s underage daughter was near J.L. See, that was the thing to do to deescalate a potential nuclear situation. It didn\u0027t have to be like this.\\n\\n He would have just taken Bobby out into the night, too, while his momma wasn\u0027t looking, and gotten him sho\u0027 \u0027nuff straight. Marj was worried about homeschooling her boy... Sheeit, he woulda schooled the boy right, and all would have been very co-pacetic. She could tell Krissy whatever, and let her daughter eventually grow into her own.\\n\\n Carlos smiled. J.L. just would have had to deal until then, like he did. He loved the brother, but J.L. wouldn\u0027t die from having his nose wide open, would just feel like he was gonna, but hey. He\u0027d waited for Damali, and had lived... well, kinda sorta. Survived was more accurate. Still. Her daddy was in da house, and Berkfield was a good man that he owed, so even in his old life, he wasn\u0027t gonna fuck with certain protocols. Peace.\\n\\n That\u0027s right. Besides, he mighta been able to have a little convo with Juanita to make her go on and be with Jose, no past haunting thoughts allowed. He\u0027d wipe the slate clean. Jose deserved that level of man-woman lock without her side glances toward an old flame, and in that very brief platonic discussion he coulda made Juanita think hombre walked on water. Sheeit, and for his brother, \u0027Nita would have been the alpha and the omega. Problem solved. No more drama.\\n\\n Yeah. If he was back on his old block, back on a throne, he woulda given Jose a double dose of some mad-crazy shit, \u0027cause he owed his line brother his life for watching his back... woulda given him all he wished he could have given Lopez to make up for the fallen. That woulda been a fair exchange, even in his old world.\\n\\n Coulda then put them all in an off-da-meter lair with every convenience, but built like Fort Knox. Wouldn\u0027t have turned nobody but Rider, all Guardian souls would have been intact, minimal losses. Everybody happy. There were a lot of things he used to be able to do without breaking a vein. The Light would have lost the only weary soul in the transactions, Rider\u0027s, one that\u0027s quickly slipping from their grasp any ol\u0027 way, if they didn\u0027t give the man a break and some immediate relief.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s only human,\" Carlos said, his voice tight from anger, going down the steps to retrieve a garden hose. Who knows, since it would have been done for love, maybe the Light coulda worked a deal for Rider, too? Shoulda. Maybe they wouldn\u0027t have been too salty with him for doing it, since it woulda been a mercy nick? Moot point. He no longer owned the equipment to do anything like that.\\n\\n Regardless, in his old nighttime splendor and under his protective seal, within his heavily fortified lairs, they would have all lived like the royalty they were, and not been fugitives livin\u0027 on the run. Carlos sprayed off the mop and then shot water across the porch, lost in darkening thoughts.\\n\\n What good was money when you couldn\u0027t spend it to the max? Screw the police inquiries about where he might have gotten phat-paid, and fuck the feds, whoever, his shit would have been all vamp. Untraceable. Situation smooth.\\n\\n That would have chilled out Marj, therefore Berkfield - cool people who deserved some respite from worry, like everybody else. Fam. He woulda taken care of his peeps, all of them. That\u0027s what he\u0027d tried to do before he\u0027d been turned. It was still in his DNA. Serve and protect, but he preferred to do the shit with style.\\n\\n Carlos laughed quietly. \"Yeah, but don\u0027t worry, I would have also given a healthy tithe on the down low to you, Father Pat�wild as that sounds. I would have been discreet for both of us to stay politically correct.\"\\n\\n He had to get out of his own head before he lost his mind like Rider. Because, if he\u0027d had it his way, after all that, then he woulda stepped to the Chairman mano-a-mano in Hell, like it should have been done... handled his business for both himself and Damali�snatched a bone out of that old bastard\u0027s ass, then come home to his woman, righteous, and laid down V-point so hard she woulda walked away with twins. Carlos smiled. One day. Maybe one night.\\n\\n Then all would be right in the world, and nothin\u0027 would have dared to slither up into his domain topside to make any of the teams ever have to go to war again. Shit, after that, he mighta even been so bold to have taken the Chairman\u0027s throne, fair exchange, almost, given the blues the sonofabitch had levied on him... but there would never be enough to repay what he\u0027d done to Damali.\\n\\n However, the shit woulda been cool, until he said it wasn\u0027t. That was power. Being able to protect his family with unquestioned authority and to make their world sweet. Paradise. No static. Plush environs. To know what they wanted before they even had to ask. Ultimate provider. Stone-cold soldier that nobody fucked with, thus no one dared fuck with his people. That was how a man was supposed to handle his bizness.\\n\\n He, as the man, was supposed to have that burden solely on his shoulders; his family was supposed to live, laugh, relax, be taken care of, all needs met. Bam. Consider it done. Every man\u0027s secret dream was to be able to do that.\\n\\n Carlos dropped the hose and stared at his palms. \"Is that so wrong?\" he whispered.\\n\\n His woman wasn\u0027t supposed to have to do shit, unless she wanted to... and he was supposed to hook her up so lovely that she didn\u0027t wanna necessarily do jack but chill. His baby could just sing and leave her blade at home. Talk about a dream come true...\\n\\n She wasn\u0027t supposed to have to go to Hell and back and be worried about being attacked all the time... too scared even to think about carrying their next child, too stressed to sleep at night, too nervous to make love to make another one. Wasn\u0027t supposed to be buggin\u0027 about being his wife or tying the knot legal... talking crazy shit about living by herself to have space to think. Think about what, after all they\u0027d been through? If he was on the job, there\u0027d be no decision. Be no arguments. The word no about everything lately would be banished.\\n\\n The shine had gone out of her gorgeous eyes under the strain. No wonder her silver never lit; the girl was exhausted. Beyond fatigued. He\u0027d allow that to happen to her on his watch, was off the job, so she had to pick up the damned slack. Isn\u0027t that how his mother grew old fast, dealing with his father\u0027s pitiful bullshit? God, don\u0027t let that happen to him.\\n\\n Carlos took his time walking up the steps. Coffee was calling his name.\\n\\n Naw, this was not supposed to be the way it was. Damali deserved the world, and at one point, he\u0027d been able to give her that. His state of affairs had become a travesty, and yet his woman tried her best to make it all seem like it was okay. It wasn\u0027t. He knew it; she knew it. That\u0027s what she had to think about, most likely. But that she\u0027d made the attempt only made him love her more... and made him equally more determined than ever to fix this bull fast.\\n\\n \"This ain\u0027t me by a long shot.\" Carlos sighed heavily and looked at his hands, then snapped hard once. \"Power used to jump off with a pop, just like that,\" he whispered, enraged as he stared at the flimsy screen door. \"So, if I\u0027m the male Neteru, where\u0027s the serious juice that comes with the new title? I got a woman and a family to take care of. Y\u0027all listening? How am I gonna take care of my kids when we have \u0027em?\"\\n\\n By any man\u0027s standards, especially his, if the truth be told, his old throne was something hellacious to be reckoned with by comparison to what he was dealing with now. It was about resources and the broad definition thereof. Always had been, he\u0027d told Father Pat that from night one. Rider said talk to the old priest - about what? It might not be what the Covenant wanted to hear, but he was being honest in the silent morning hour.\\n\\n Facts mentally dissected in the cold light of day weren\u0027t always pretty. He had his reasons for doubt, issues that had not been addressed, a legitimate argument, and nobody was giving up answers that made sense, to his mind. All of it tumbled in on him like a ton of loose pyramid bricks.\\n\\n To him, his soul was tethered by steel cable to his understanding of manhood. Period. It felt like C4 had been rigged to that definition, then exploded, and his soul had caught the shrapnel, took the impact as the blast whipped up the tie line; it had snapped and was strangling him.\\n\\n He knew he\u0027d been tripping since Philly, but couldn\u0027t help it or stop himself as his tortured soul began working on his embattled mind, unraveling it as what was left of his soul clawed to survive, until his body had gotten involved and simply malfunctioned. All aspects of the dilemma were unacceptable to him. The Light needed to get with that.\\n\\n This new life had disintegrated everything he believed a man should be. At this juncture, he wasn\u0027t sure if he cared if the Light took his thoughts the wrong way. So what that they had issues, he did, too. Yeah, he\u0027d work for them from either side, as he did before - if it ever came down to that, again. He knew the deal in spades by now, aces wild. His woman and her family needed the table slanted to the good just to grant them peace. No problem. But not being able to do that for them the way he felt it efficiently needed to be done was torture. Was it wrong for a man to dream? Was ambition with good intent a sin? Not hardly. Not where he was from.\\n\\n Carlos opened the door the old-fashioned way, walked into the house, and let the screen door slam shut behind him. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-damned-vampire-huntress-legend-6/page-6.html","bookId":2530,"book":{"id":2530,"title":"The Damned (Vampire Huntress Legend #6)","description":"Storyline: The Damned (Vampire Huntress Legend #6) \\n Damali Richards knows all about a blood rush.
