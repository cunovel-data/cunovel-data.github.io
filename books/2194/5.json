{"id":100763,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"4\n The detective hustled me off after that, telling me he was going to get the crime scene officer out to the house, and he\u0027d be in touch. I got the idea, right out of his brain, that there was something he didn\u0027t want me to see, and that he\u0027d thrown Carla Rodriguez at me to distract me.\n And I thought he might take the shotgun away, since he seemed much more sure now he was dealing with a crime, and the shotgun might be part of some bit of evidence. But Alcee Beck didn\u0027t say anything, so I didn\u0027t remind him.\n I was more shaken than I wanted to admit to myself. Inwardly, I\u0027d been convinced that, though I needed to track my brother down, Jason was really okay - just misplaced. Or mislaid, more likely, ho ho ho. Possibly he was in some kind of not-too-serious trouble, I\u0027d told myself. Now things were looking more serious.\n I\u0027ve never been able to squeeze my budget enough to afford a cell phone, so I began driving home. I was thinking of whom I should call, and I came up with the same answer as before. No one. There was no definite news to break. I felt as lonely as I ever have in my life. But I just didn\u0027t want to be Crisis Woman, showing up on friends\u0027 doorsteps with trouble on my shoulders.\n Tears welled up in my eyes. I wanted my grandmother back. I pulled over to the side of the road and slapped myself on the cheek, hard. I called myself a few names.\n Shreveport. I\u0027d go to Shreveport and confront Dovie and Carla Rodriguez. While I was there, I\u0027d find out if Chow and Pam knew anything about Jason\u0027s disappearance - though it was hours until they\u0027d be up, and I\u0027d just be kicking my heels in an empty club, assuming there\u0027d be someone there to let me in. But I just couldn\u0027t sit at home, waiting. I could read the minds of the human employees and find out if they knew what was up.\n On the one hand, if I went to Shreveport, I\u0027d be out of touch with what was happening here. On the other hand, I\u0027d be doing something.\n While I was trying to decide if there were any more hands to consider, something else happened.\n It was even odder than the preceding events of the day. There I was, parked in the middle of nowhere at the side of a parish road, when a sleek, black, brand-new Camaro pulled onto the shoulder behind me. Out of the passenger\u0027s side stepped a gorgeous woman, at least six feet tall. Of course, I remembered her; she\u0027d been in Merlotte\u0027s on New Year\u0027s Eve. My friend Tara Thornton was in the driver\u0027s seat.\n Okay, I thought blankly, staring into the rearview mirror, this is weird. I hadn\u0027t seen Tara in weeks, since we\u0027d met by chance in a vampire club in Jackson, Mississippi. She\u0027d been there with a vamp named Franklin Mott; he\u0027d been very handsome in a senior-citizen sort of way, polished, dangerous, and sophisticated.\n Tara always looks great. My high school friend has black hair, and dark eyes, and a smooth olive complexion, and she has a lot of intelligence that she uses running Tara\u0027s Togs, an upscale women\u0027s clothing store that rents space in a strip mall Bill owns. (Well, it\u0027s as upscale as Bon Temps has to offer.) Tara had become a friend of mine years before, because she came from an even sadder background than mine.\n But the tall woman put even Tara in the shade. She was as dark-haired as Tara, though the new woman had reddish highlights that surprised the eye. She had dark eyes, too, but hers were huge and almond-shaped, almost abnormally large. Her skin was as pale as milk, and her legs were as long as a stepladder. She was quite gifted in the bosom department, and she was wearing fire engine red from head to toe. Her lipstick matched.\n \"Sookie,\" Tara called. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" She walked carefully up to my old car, watching her feet because she was wearing glossy, brown leather, high-heeled boots she didn\u0027t want to scuff. They\u0027d have lasted five minutes on my feet. I spend too much of my time standing up to worry about footwear that only looks good.\n Tara looked successful, attractive, and secure, in her sage green sweater and taupe pants. \"I was putting on my makeup when I heard over the police scanner that something was up at Jason\u0027s house,\" she said. She slid in the passenger\u0027s seat and leaned over to hug me. \"When I got to Jason\u0027s, I saw you pulling out. What\u0027s up?\" The woman in red was standing with her back to the car, tactfully looking out into the woods.\n I\u0027d adored my father, and I\u0027d always known (and my mother herself definitely believed) that no matter what Mother put me through, she was acting out of love. But Tara\u0027s parents had been evil, both alcoholics and abusers. Tara\u0027s older sisters and brothers had left home as fast as they could, leaving Tara, as the youngest, to foot the bill for their freedom.\n Yet now that I was in trouble, here she was, ready to help.\n \"Well, Jason\u0027s gone missing,\" I said, in a fairly level voice, but then I ruined the effect by giving one of those awful choking sobs. I turned my face so I\u0027d be looking out my window. I was embarrassed to show such distress in front of the new woman.\n Wisely ignoring my tears, Tara began asking me the logical questions: Had Jason called in to work? Had he called me the night before? Who had he been dating lately?\n That reminded me of the shifter girl who\u0027d been Jason\u0027s date New Year\u0027s Eve. I thought I could even talk about the girl\u0027s otherness, because Tara had been at Club Dead that night. Tara\u0027s tall companion was a Supe of some kind. Tara knew all about the secret world.\n But she didn\u0027t, as it turned out.\n Her memory had been erased. Or at least she pretended it had.\n \"What?\" Tara asked, with almost exaggerated confusion. \"Werewolves? At that nightclub? I remember seeing you there. Honey, didn\u0027t you drink a little too much and pass out, or something?\"\n Since I drink very sparingly, Tara\u0027s question made me quite angry, but it was also the most unremarkable explanation Franklin Mott could have planted in Tara\u0027s head. I was so disappointed at not getting to confide in her that I closed my eyes so I wouldn\u0027t have to see the blank look on her face. I felt tears leaving little paths down my cheeks. I should have just let it go, but I said, in a low, harsh voice, \"No, I didn\u0027t.\"\n \"Omigosh, did your date put something in your drink?\" In genuine horror, Tara squeezed my hand. \"That Rohypnol? But Alcide looked like such a nice guy!\"\n \"Forget it,\" I said, trying to sound gentler. \"It doesn\u0027t really have anything to do with Jason, after all.\"\n Her face still troubled, Tara pressed my hand again.\n All of a sudden, I was certain I didn\u0027t believe her. Tara knew vampires could remove memory, and she was pretending Franklin Mott had erased hers. I thought Tara remembered quite well what had happened at Club Dead, but she was pretending she didn\u0027t to protect herself. If she had to do that to survive, that was okay. I took a deep breath.\n \"Are you still dating Franklin?\" I asked, to start a different conversation.\n \"He got me this car.\"\n I was a little shocked and more than a little dismayed, but I hoped I was not the kind to point fingers.\n \"It\u0027s a wonderful car. You don\u0027t know any witches, do you?\" I asked, trying to change the subject before Tara could read my misgivings. I was sure she would laugh at me for asking her such a question, but it was a good diversion. I wouldn\u0027t hurt her for the world.\n Finding a witch would be a great help. I was sure Jason\u0027s abduction - and I swore to myself it was an abduction, it was not a murder - was linked to the witches\u0027 curse on Eric. It was just too much coincidence otherwise. On the other hand, I had certainly experienced the twists and turns of a bunch of coincidences in the past few months. There, I knew I\u0027d find a third hand.\n \"Sure I do,\" Tara said, smiling proudly. \"Now there I can help you. That is, if a Wiccan will do?\"\n I had so many expressions I wasn\u0027t sure my face could fit them all in. Shock, fear, grief, and worry were tumbling around in my brain. When the spinning stopped, we would see which one was at the top.\n \"You\u0027re a witch?\" I said weakly.\n \"Oh, gosh, no, not me. I\u0027m a Catholic. But I have some friends who are Wiccan. Some of them are witches.\"\n \"Oh, really?\" I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d ever heard the word Wiccan before, though maybe I\u0027d read it in a mystery or romance novel. \"I\u0027m sorry, I don\u0027t know what that means,\" I said, my voice humble.\n \"Holly can explain it better than I can,\" Tara said.\n \"Holly. The Holly who works with me?\"\n \"Sure. Or you could go to Danielle, though she\u0027s not going to be as willing to talk. Holly and Danielle are in the same coven.\"\n I was so shocked by now I might as well get even more stunned. \"Coven,\" I repeated.\n \"You know, a group of pagans who worship together.\"\n \"I thought a coven had to be witches?\"\n \"I guess not - but they have to, you know, be non-Christian. I mean, Wicca is a religion.\"\n \"Okay,\" I said. \"Okay. Do you think Holly would talk to me about this?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know why not.\" Tara went back to her car to get her cell phone, and paced back and forth between our vehicles while she talked to Holly. I appreciated a little respite to allow me to get back on my mental feet, so to speak. To be polite I got out of my car and spoke to the woman in red, who\u0027d been very patient.\n \"I\u0027m sorry to meet you on such a bad day,\" I said. \"I\u0027m Sookie Stackhouse.\"\n \"I\u0027m Claudine,\" she said, with a beautiful smile. Her teeth were Hollywood white. Her skin had an odd quality; it looked glossy and thin, reminding me of the skin of a plum; like if you bit her, sweet juice would gush out. \"I\u0027m here because of all the activity.\"\n \"Oh?\" I said, taken aback.\n \"Sure. You have vampires, and Weres, and lots of other stuff all tangled up here in Bon Temps - to say nothing of several important and powerful crossroads. I was drawn to all the possibilities.\"\n \"Uh-huh,\" I said uncertainly. \"So, do you plan on just observing all this, or what?\"\n \"Oh, no. Just observing is not my way.\" She laughed. \"You\u0027re quite the wild card, aren\u0027t you?\"\n \"Holly\u0027s up,\" Tara said, snapping her phone shut and smiling because it was hard not to with Claudine around. I realized I was smiling from ear to ear, not my usual tense grin but an expression of sunny happiness. \"She says come on over.\"\n \"Are you coming with me?\" I didn\u0027t know what to think of Tara\u0027s companion.\n \"Sorry, Claudine\u0027s helping me today at the shop,\" Tara said. \"We\u0027re having a New Year\u0027s sale on our old inventory, and people are doing some heavy shopping. Want me to put something aside for you? I\u0027ve got a few really pretty party dresses left. Didn\u0027t the one you wore in Jackson get ruined?\"\n Yeah, because a fanatic had driven a stake through my side. The dress had definitely suffered. \"It got stained,\" I said with great restraint. \"It\u0027s real nice of you to offer, but I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll have time to try anything on. With Jason and everything, I\u0027ve got so much to think about.\" And precious little extra money, I told myself.\n \"Sure,\" said Tara. She hugged me again. \"You call me if you need me, Sookie. It\u0027s funny that I don\u0027t remember that evening in Jackson any better. Maybe I had too much to drink, too. Did we dance?\"\n \"Oh, yes, you talked me into doing that routine we did at the high school talent show.\"\n \"I did not!\" She was begging me to deny it, with a half smile on her face.\n \"\u0027Fraid so.\" I knew damn well she remembered it.\n \"I wish I\u0027d been there,\" said Claudine. \"I love to dance.\"\n \"Believe me, that night in Club Dead is one I wish I\u0027d missed,\" I said.\n \"Well, remind me never to go back to Jackson, if I did that dance in public,\" Tara said.\n \"I don\u0027t think either of us better go back to Jackson.\" I\u0027d left some very irate vampires in Jackson, but the Weres were even angrier. Not that there were a lot of them left, actually. But still.\n Tara hesitated a minute, obviously trying to frame something she wanted to tell me. \"Since Bill owns the building Tara\u0027s Togs is in,\" she said carefully, \"I do have a number to call, a number he said he\u0027d check in with while he was out of the country. So if you need to let him know anything... ?\"\n \"Thanks,\" I said, not sure if I felt thankful at all. \"He told me he left a number on a pad by the phone in his house.\" There was a kind of finality to Bill\u0027s being out of the country, unreachable. I hadn\u0027t even thought of trying to get in touch with him about my predicament; out of all the people I\u0027d considered calling, he hadn\u0027t even crossed my mind.\n \"It\u0027s just that he seemed pretty, you know, down.\" Tara examined the toes of her boots. \"Melancholy,\" she said, as if she enjoyed using a word that didn\u0027t pass her lips often. Claudine beamed with approval. What a strange gal. Her huge eyes were luminous with joy as she patted me on the shoulder.\n I swallowed hard. \"Well, he\u0027s never exactly Mr. Smiley,\" I said. \"I do miss him. But...\" I shook my head emphatically. \"It was just too hard. He just... upset me too much. I thank you for letting me know I can call him if I need to, and I really, really appreciate your telling me about Holly.\"\n Tara, flushed with the deserved pleasure of having done her good deed for the day, got back in her spanky-new Camaro. After folding her long self into the passenger seat, Claudine waved at me as Tara pulled away. I sat in my car for a moment longer, trying to remember where Holly Cleary lived. I thought I remembered her complaining about the closet size in her apartment, and that meant the Kingfisher Arms.\n When I got to the U-shaped building on the southern approach to Bon Temps, I checked the mailboxes to discover Holly\u0027s apartment number. She was on the ground floor, in number 4. Holly had a five-year-old son, Cody. Holly and her best friend, Danielle Gray, had both gotten married right out of high school, and both had been divorced within five years. Danielle\u0027s mom was a great help to Danielle, but Holly was not so lucky. Her long-divorced parents had both moved away, and her grandmother had died in the Alzheimer\u0027s wing of the Renard Parish nursing home. Holly had dated Detective Andy Bellefleur for a few months, but nothing had come of it. Rumor had it that old Caroline Bellefleur, Andy\u0027s grandmother, had thought Holly wasn\u0027t \"good\" enough for Andy. I had no opinion on that. Neither Holly nor Andy was on my shortlist of favorite people, though I definitely felt cooler toward Andy.\n When Holly answered her door, I realized all of a sudden how much she\u0027d changed over the past few weeks. For years, her hair had been dyed a dandelion yellow. Now it was matte black and spiked. Her ears had four piercings apiece. And I noticed her hipbones pushing at the thin denim of her aged jeans.\n \"Hey, Sookie,\" she said, pleasantly enough. \"Tara asked me if I would talk to you, but I wasn\u0027t sure if you\u0027d show up. Sorry about Jason. Come on in.\"\n The apartment was small, of course, and though it had been repainted recently, it showed evidence of years of heavy use. There was a living room - dining room - kitchen combo, with a breakfast bar separating the galley kitchen from the rest of the area. There were a few toys in a basket in the corner of the room, and there was a can of Pledge and a rag on the scarred coffee table. Holly had been cleaning.\n \"I\u0027m sorry to interrupt,\" I said.\n \"That\u0027s okay. Coke? Juice?\"\n \"No, thanks. Where\u0027s Cody?\"\n \"He went to stay with his dad,\" she said, looking down at her hands. \"I drove him over the day after Christmas.\"\n \"Where\u0027s his dad living?\"\n \"David\u0027s living in Springhill. He just married this girl, Allie. She already had two kids. The little girl is Cody\u0027s age, and he just loves to play with her. It\u0027s always, \u0027Shelley this,\u0027 and \u0027Shelley that.\u0027\" Holly looked kind of bleak.\n David Cleary was one of a large clan. His cousin Pharr had been in my grade all through school. For Cody\u0027s genes\u0027 sake, I hoped that David was more intelligent than Pharr, which would be real easy.\n \"I need to talk to you about something pretty personal, Holly.\"\n Holly looked surprised all over again. \"Well, we haven\u0027t exactly been on those terms, have we?\" she said. \"You ask, and I\u0027ll decide whether to answer.\"\n I tried to frame what I was going to say - to keep secret what I needed to keep secret and ask of her what I needed without offending.\n \"You\u0027re a witch?\" I said, embarrassed at using such a dramatic word.\n \"I\u0027m more of a Wiccan.\"\n \"Would you mind explaining the difference?\" I met her eyes briefly, and then decided to focus on the dried flowers in the basket on top of the television. Holly thought I could read her mind only if I was looking into her eyes. (Like physical touching, eye contact does make the reading easier, but it certainly isn\u0027t necessary.)\n \"I guess not.\" Her voice was slow, as if she were thinking as she spoke. \"You\u0027re not one to spread gossip.\"\n \"Whatever you tell me, I won\u0027t share with anyone.\" I met her eyes again, briefly.\n \"Okay,\" she said. \"Well, if you\u0027re a witch, of course, you practice magic rituals.\"\n She was using \"you\" in the general sense, I thought, because saying \"I\" would mean too bold a confession.\n \"You draw from a power that most people never tap into. Being a witch isn\u0027t being wicked, or at least it isn\u0027t supposed to be. If you\u0027re a Wiccan, you follow a religion, a pagan religion. We follow the ways of the Mother, and we have our own calendar of holy days. You can be both a Wiccan and a witch; or more one, or more the other. It\u0027s very individualized. I practice a little witchcraft, but I\u0027m more interested in the Wiccan life. We believe that your actions are okay if you don\u0027t hurt anyone else.\"\n Oddly, my first feeling was one of embarrassment, when I heard Holly tell me that she was a non-Christian. I\u0027d never met anyone who didn\u0027t at least pretend to be a Christian or who didn\u0027t give lip service to the basic Christian precepts. I was pretty sure there was a synagogue in Shreveport, but I\u0027d never even met a Jew, to the best of my knowledge. I was certainly on a learning curve.\n \"I understand. Do you know lots of witches?\"\n \"I know a few.\" Holly nodded repeatedly, still avoiding my eyes.\n I spotted an old computer on the rickety table in the corner. \"Do you have, like, a chat room online, or a bulletin board, or something?\"\n \"Oh, sure.\"\n \"Have you heard of a group of witches that\u0027s come into Shreveport lately?\"\n Holly\u0027s face became very serious. Her straight dark brows drew together in a frown. \"Tell me you\u0027re not involved with them,\" she said.\n \"Not directly. But I know someone they\u0027ve hurt, and I\u0027m afraid they might\u0027ve taken Jason.\"\n \"Then he\u0027s in bad trouble,\" she said bluntly. \"The woman who leads this group is out-and-out ruthless. Her brother is just as bad. That group, they\u0027re not like the rest of us. They\u0027re not trying to find a better way to live, or a path to get in touch with the natural world, or spells to increase their inner peace. They\u0027re Wiccans. They\u0027re evil.\"\n \"Can you give me any clues about where I might track them down?\" I was doing my best to keep my face in line. I could hear with my other sense that Holly was thinking that if the newly arrived coven had Jason, he\u0027d be hurt badly, if not killed.\n Holly, apparently in deep thought, looked out the front window of her apartment. She was afraid that they\u0027d trace any information she gave me back to her, punish her - maybe through Cody. These weren\u0027t witches who believed in doing harm to no one else. These were witches whose lives were planned around the gathering of power of all kinds.\n \"They\u0027re all women?\" I asked, because I could tell she was on the verge of resolving to tell me nothing.\n \"If you\u0027re thinking Jason would be able to charm them with his ways because he\u0027s such a looker, you can think again,\" Holly told me, her face grim and somehow stripped down to basics. She wasn\u0027t trying for any effect; she wanted me to understand how dangerous these people were. \"There are some men, too. They\u0027re... these aren\u0027t normal witches. I mean, they weren\u0027t even normal people.\"\n I was willing to believe that. I\u0027d had to believe stranger things since the night Bill Compton had walked into Merlotte\u0027s Bar.\n Holly spoke like she knew far more about this group of witches than I\u0027d ever suspected... more than the general background I\u0027d hoped to glean from her. I prodded her a little. \"What makes them different?\"\n \"They\u0027ve had vampire blood.\" Holly glanced to the side, as if she felt someone listening to her. The motion creeped me out. \"Witches - witches with a lot of power they\u0027re willing to use for evil - they\u0027re bad enough. Witches that strong who\u0027ve also had vampire blood are... Sookie, you have no idea how dangerous they are. Some of them are Weres. Please, stay away from them.\"\n Werewolves? They were not only witches, but Weres? And they drank vampire blood? I was seriously scared. I didn\u0027t know how could you get any worse. \"Where are they?\"\n \"Are you listening to me?\"\n \"I am, but I have to know where they are!\"\n \"They\u0027re in an old business not awful far from Pierre Bossier Mall,\" she said, and I could see the picture of it in her head. She\u0027d been there. She\u0027d seen them. She had this all in her head, and I was getting a lot of it.\n \"Why were you there?\" I asked, and she flinched.\n \"I was worried about talking to you,\" Holly said, her voice angry. \"I shouldn\u0027t have even let you in. But I\u0027d dated Jason.... You\u0027re gonna get me killed, Sookie Stackhouse. Me and my boy.\"\n \"No, I won\u0027t.\"\n \"I was there because their leader sent out a call for all the witches in the area to have, like, a summit. It turned out that what she wanted to do was impose her will on all of us. Some of us were pretty impressed with her commitment and her power, but most of us smaller-town Wiccans, we didn\u0027t like her drug use - that\u0027s what drinking vampire blood amounts to - or her taste for the darker side of witchcraft. Now, that\u0027s all I want to say about it.\"\n \"Thanks, Holly.\" I tried to think of something I could tell her that would relieve her fear. But she wanted me to leave more than anything in the world, and I\u0027d caused her enough upset. Holly\u0027s just letting me in the door had been a big concession, since she actually believed in my mind-reading ability. No matter what rumors they heard, people really wanted to believe that the contents of their heads were private, no matter what proof they had to the contrary.\n I did myself.\n I patted Holly on the shoulder as I left, but she didn\u0027t get up from the old couch. She stared at me with hopeless brown eyes, as if any moment someone was going to come in the door and cut off her head.\n That look frightened me more than her words, more than her ideas, and I left the Kingfisher Arms as quickly as I could, trying to note the few people who saw me turn out of the parking lot. I didn\u0027t recognize any of them.\n I wondered why the witches in Shreveport would want Jason, how they could have made a connection between the missing Eric and my brother. How could I approach them to find out? Would Pam and Chow help, or had they taken their own steps?\n And whose blood had the witches been drinking?\n Since vampires had made their presence known among us, nearly three years ago now, they\u0027d become preyed upon in a new way. Instead of fearing getting staked through the heart by wanna-be Van Helsings, vampires dreaded modern entrepreneurs called Drainers. Drainers traveled in teams, singling out vampires by a variety of methods and binding them with silver chains (usually in a carefully planned ambush), then draining their blood into vials. Depending on the age of the vampire, a vial of blood could fetch from $200 to $400 on the black market. The effect of drinking this blood? Quite unpredictable, once the blood had left the vampire. I guess that was part of the attraction. Most commonly, for a few weeks, the drinker gained strength, visual acuity, a feeling of robust health, and enhanced attractiveness. It depended on the age of the drained vampire and the freshness of the blood.\n Of course, those effects faded, unless you drank more blood.\n A certain percentage of people who experienced drinking vampire blood could hardly wait to scratch up money for more. These blood junkies were extremely dangerous, of course. City police forces were glad to hire vampires to deal with them, since regular cops would simply get pulped.\n Every now and then, a blood drinker simply went mad - sometimes in a quiet, gibbering kind of way, but sometimes spectacularly and murderously. There was no way to predict who would be stricken this way, and it could happen on the first drinking.\n So there were men with glittering mad eyes in padded cells and there were electrifying movie stars who equally owed their condition to the Drainers. Draining was a hazardous job, of course. Sometimes the vampire got loose, with a very predictable result. A court in Florida had ruled this vampire retaliation justifiable homicide, in one celebrated case, because Drainers notoriously discarded their victims. They left a vampire, all but empty of blood, too weak to move, wherever the vamp happened to fall. The weakened vampire died when the sun came up, unless he had the good fortune to be discovered and helped to safety during the hours of darkness. It took years to recover from a draining, and that was years of help from other vamps. Bill had told me there were shelters for drained vamps, and that their location was kept very secret.\n Witches with nearly the physical power of vampires - that seemed a very dangerous combination. I kept thinking of women when I thought of the coven that had moved into Shreveport, and I kept correcting myself. Men, Holly had said, were in the group.\n I looked at the clock at the drive-through bank, and I saw it was just after noon. It would be full dark by a few minutes before six; Eric had gotten up a little earlier than that, at times. I could certainly go to Shreveport and come back by then. I couldn\u0027t think of another plan, and I just couldn\u0027t go home and sit and wait. Even wasting gas was better than going back to my house, though worry for Jason crawled up and down my spine. I could take the time to drop off the shotgun, but as long as it was unloaded and the shells were in a separate location, it should be legal enough to drive around with it.\n For the first time in my life, I checked my rearview mirror to see if I was being followed. I am not up on spy techniques, but if someone was following me, I couldn\u0027t spot him. I stopped and got gas and an ICEE, just to see if anyone pulled into the gas station behind me, but no one did. That was real good, I decided, hoping that Holly was safe.\n As I drove, I had time to review my conversation with Holly. I realized it was the first one I\u0027d ever had with Holly in which Danielle\u0027s name had not come up once. Holly and Danielle had been joined at the hip since grade school. They probably had their periods at the same time. Danielle\u0027s parents, cradle members of the Free Will Church of God\u0027s Anointed, would have a fit if they knew, so it wasn\u0027t any wonder that Holly had been so discreet.\n Our little town of Bon Temps had stretched its gates open wide enough to tolerate vampires, and gay people didn\u0027t have a very hard time of it anymore (kind of depending on how they expressed their sexual preference). However, I thought the gates might snap shut for Wiccans.\n The peculiar and beautiful Claudine had told me that she was attracted to Bon Temps for its very strangeness.

She has only a few close friends, because not everyone appreciates Sookie’s gift: she can read minds.

Maybe that’s why, when she comes across a naked vampire, she doesn’t just drive on by. He hasn’t got a clue who he is, but Sookie has: Eric looks just as scary and sexy – and dead – as ever. But now he has amnesia, he’s sweet, vulnerable, and in need of Sookie’s help – because whoever took his memory now wants his life.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/dead-to-the-world-sookie-stackhouse-4.jpg","author":"Charlaine Harris","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/dead-to-the-world-sookie-stackhouse-4.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:26 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:55:56 PM"}}
