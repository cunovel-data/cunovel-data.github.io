{"id":100764,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"5\\n\\n Carla Rodriguez, my most promising lead, came first. I\u0027d looked up the old address I had for Dovie, with whom I\u0027d exchanged the odd Christmas card. I found the house with a little difficulty. It was well away from the shopping areas that were my only normal stops in Shreveport. The houses were small and close together where Dovie lived, and some of them were in bad repair.\\n\\n I felt a distinct thrill of triumph when Carla herself answered the door. She had a black eye, and she was hungover, both signs that she\u0027d had a big night the night before.\\n\\n \"Hey, Sookie,\" she said, identifying me after a moment. \"What\u0027re you doing here? I was at Merlotte\u0027s last night, but I didn\u0027t see you there. You still working there?\"\\n\\n \"I am. It was my night off.\" Now that I was actually looking at Carla, I wasn\u0027t sure how to explain to her what I needed. I decided to be blunt. \"Listen, Jason\u0027s not at work this morning, and I kind of wondered if he might be here with you.\"\\n\\n \"Honey, I got nothing against you, but Jason\u0027s the last man on earth I\u0027d sleep with,\" Carla said flatly. I stared at her, hearing that she was telling me truth. \"I ain\u0027t gonna stick my hand in the fire twice, having gotten burnt the first time. I did look around the bar a little, thinking I might see him, but if I had, I\u0027d have turned the other way.\"\\n\\n I nodded. That seemed all there was to say on the subject. We exchanged a few more polite sentences, and I chatted with Dovie, who had a toddler balanced on her hip, but then it was time for me to leave. My most promising lead had just evaporated in the length of two sentences.\\n\\n Trying to suppress my desperation, I drove to a busy corner filling station and parked, to check my Shreveport map. It didn\u0027t take me long to figure out how to get from Dovie\u0027s suburb to the vampire bar.\\n\\n Fangtasia was in a shopping center close to Toys \"R\" Us. It opened at six P.M. year-round, but of course the vampires didn\u0027t show up until full dark, which depended on the season. The front of Fangtasia was painted flat gray, and the neon writing was all in red. \"Shreveport\u0027s Premier Vampire Bar,\" read the newly added, smaller writing under the exotic script of the bar\u0027s name. I winced and looked away.\\n\\n Two summers before, a small group of vamps from Oklahoma had tried to set up a rival bar in adjacent Bossier City. After one particularly hot, short August night, they\u0027d never been seen again, and the building they\u0027d been renovating had burned to the ground.\\n\\n Tourists thought stories like this were actually amusing and colorful. It added to the thrill of ordering overpriced drinks (from human waitresses dressed in trailing black \"vampire\" outfits) while staring at real, honest-to-God, undead bloodsuckers. Eric made the Area Five vampires show up for this unappealing duty by giving them a set number of hours each week to present themselves at Fangtasia. Most of his underlings weren\u0027t enthusiastic about exhibiting themselves, but it did give them a chance to hook up with fang-bangers who actually yearned for the chance to be bitten. Such encounters didn\u0027t take place on the premises: Eric had rules about that. And so did the police department. The only legal biting that could take place between humans and vampires was between consenting adults, in private.\\n\\n Automatically, I pulled around to the rear of the shopping center. Bill and I had almost always used the employee entrance. Back here, the door was just a gray door in a gray wall, with the name of the bar put on in stick-on letters from WalMart. Right below that, a large, black, stenciled notice proclaimed STAFF ONLY. I lifted my hand to knock, and then I realized I could see that the inner dead bolt had not been employed.\\n\\n The door was unlocked.\\n\\n This was really, really bad.\\n\\n Though it was broad daylight, the hair on the back of my neck stood up. Abruptly, I wished I had Bill at my back. I wasn\u0027t missing his tender love, either. It\u0027s probably a bad indicator of your lifestyle when you miss your ex-boyfriend because he\u0027s absolutely lethal.\\n\\n Though the public face of the shopping center was fairly busy, the service side was deserted. The silence was crawling with possibilities, and none of them was pleasant. I leaned my forehead against the cold gray door. I decided to get back in my old car and get the hell out of there, which would have been amazingly smart.\\n\\n And I would have gone, if I hadn\u0027t heard the moaning.\\n\\n Even then, if I\u0027d been able to spot a pay phone, I would\u0027ve just called 911 and stayed outside until someone official showed up. But there wasn\u0027t one in sight, and I couldn\u0027t stand the possibility that someone needed my help real bad, and I\u0027d withheld it because I was chicken.\\n\\n There was a heavy garbage can right by the back door, and after I\u0027d yanked the door open - standing aside for a second to avoid anything that might dart out - I maneuvered the can to hold the door ajar. I had goose bumps all over my arms as I stepped inside.\\n\\n Windowless Fangtasia requires electric light, twenty-four/seven. Since none of these lights were on, the interior was just a dark pit. Winter daylight extended weakly down the hall that led to the bar proper. On the right were the doors to Eric\u0027s office and the bookkeeper\u0027s room. On the left was the door to the large storeroom, which also contained the employee bathroom. This hall ended in a heavy door to discourage any fun lovers from penetrating to the back of the club. This door, too, was open, for the first time in my memory. Beyond it lay the black silent cavern of the bar. I wondered if anything was sitting at those tables or huddled in those booths.\\n\\n I was holding my breath so I could detect the least little noise. After a few seconds, I heard a scraping movement and another sound of pain, coming from the storeroom. Its door was slightly ajar. I took four silent steps to that door. My heart was pounding all the way up in my throat as I reached into the darkness to flip the light switch.\\n\\n The glare made me blink.\\n\\n Belinda, the only half-intelligent fang-banger I\u0027d ever met, was lying on the storeroom floor in a curiously contorted position. Her legs were bent double, her heels pressed against her hips. There was no blood - in fact, no visible mark - on her. Apparently, she was having a giant and perpetual leg cramp.\\n\\n I knelt beside Belinda, my eyes darting glances in all directions. I saw no other movement in the room, though its corners were obscured with stacks of liquor cartons and a coffin that was used as a prop in a show the vampires sometimes put on for special parties. The employee bathroom door was shut.\\n\\n \"Belinda,\" I whispered. \"Belinda, look at me.\"\\n\\n Belinda\u0027s eyes were red and swollen behind their glasses, and her cheeks were wet with tears. She blinked and focused on my face.\\n\\n \"Are they still here?\" I asked, knowing she\u0027d understand that I meant \"the people who did this to you.\"\\n\\n \"Sookie,\" she said hoarsely. Her voice was weak, and I wondered how long she\u0027d lain there waiting for help. \"Oh, thank God. Tell Master Eric we tried to hold them off.\" Still role-playing, you notice, even in her agony: \"Tell our chieftain we fought to the death\" - you know the kind of thing.\\n\\n \"Who\u0027d you try to hold off?\" I asked sharply.\\n\\n \"The witches. They came in last night after we\u0027d closed, after Pam and Chow had gone. Just Ginger and me...\"\\n\\n \"What did they want?\" I had time to notice that Belinda was still wearing her filmy black waitress outfit with the slit up the long skirt, and there were still puncture marks painted on her neck.\\n\\n \"They wanted to know where we\u0027d put Master Eric. They seemed to think they\u0027d done... something to him, and that we\u0027d hidden him.\" During her long pause, her face contorted, and I could tell she was in terrible pain, but I couldn\u0027t tell what was wrong with her. \"My legs,\" she moaned. \"Oh\\n\\n \"But you didn\u0027t know, so you couldn\u0027t tell them.\"\\n\\n \"I would never betray our master.\"\\n\\n And Belinda was the one with sense.\\n\\n \"Was anyone here besides Ginger, Belinda?\" But she was so deep into a spasm of suffering that she couldn\u0027t answer. Her whole body was rigid with pain, that low moan tearing out of her throat again.\\n\\n I called 911 from Eric\u0027s office, since I knew the location of the phone there. The room had been tossed, and some frisky witch had spray painted a big red pentagram on one of the walls. Eric was going to love that.\\n\\n I returned to Belinda to tell her the ambulance was coming. \"What\u0027s wrong with your legs?\" I asked, scared of the answer.\\n\\n \"They made the muscle in the back of my legs pull up, like it was half as long....\" And she began moaning again. \"It\u0027s like one of those giant cramps you get when you\u0027re pregnant.\"\\n\\n It was news to me that Belinda had ever been pregnant.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s Ginger?\" I asked, when her pain seemed to have ebbed a little.\\n\\n \"She was in the bathroom.\"\\n\\n Ginger, a pretty strawberry blonde, as dumb as a rock, was still there. I don\u0027t think they\u0027d meant to kill her. But they\u0027d put a spell on her legs like they\u0027d done to Belinda\u0027s, it looked like; her legs were drawn up double in the same peculiar and painful way, even in death. Ginger had been standing in front of the sink when she\u0027d crumpled, and her head had hit the lip of the sink on her way down. Her eyes were sightless and her hair was matted with some clotted blood that had oozed from the depression in her temple.\\n\\n There was nothing to be done. I didn\u0027t even touch Ginger; she was so obviously dead. I didn\u0027t say anything about her to Belinda, who was in too much agony to understand, anyway. She had a couple more moments of lucidity before I took off. I asked her where to find Pam and Chow so I could warn them, and Belinda said they just showed up at the bar when it became dark.\\n\\n She also said the woman who\u0027d worked the spell was a witch named Hallow, and she was almost six feet tall, with short brown hair and a black design painted on her face.\\n\\n That should make her easy to identify.\\n\\n \"She told me she was as strong as a vampire, too,\" Belinda gasped. \"You see...\" Belinda pointed beyond me. I whirled, expecting an attack. Nothing that alarming happened, but what I saw was almost as disturbing as what I\u0027d imagined. It was the handle of the dolly the staff used to wheel cases of drinks around. The long metal handle had been twisted into a U.\\n\\n \"I know Master Eric will kill her when he returns,\" Belinda said falteringly after a minute, the words coming out in jagged bursts because of the pain.\\n\\n \"Sure he will,\" I said stoutly. I hesitated, feeling crummy beyond words. \"Belinda, I have to go because I don\u0027t want the police to keep me here for questioning. Please don\u0027t mention my name. Just say a passerby heard you, okay?\"\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s Master Eric? Is he really missing?\"\\n\\n \"I have no idea,\" I said, forced to lie. \"I have to get out of here.\"\\n\\n \"Go,\" Belinda said, her voice ragged. \"We\u0027re lucky you came in at all.\"\\n\\n I had to get out of there. I knew nothing about what had happened at the bar, and being questioned for hours would cost me time I couldn\u0027t afford, with my brother missing.\\n\\n Back in my car and on my way out of the shopping center, I passed the police cars and the ambulance as they headed in. I\u0027d wiped the doorknob clean of my fingerprints. Other than that, I couldn\u0027t think of what I\u0027d touched and what I hadn\u0027t, no matter how carefully I reviewed my actions. There\u0027d be a million prints there, anyway; gosh, it was a bar.\\n\\n After a minute, I realized I was just driving with no direction. I was overwhelmingly rattled. I pulled over into yet another filling station parking lot and looked at the pay phone longingly. I could call Alcide, ask him if he knew where Pam and Chow spent their daytime hours. Then I could go there and leave a message or something, warn them about what had happened.\\n\\n I made myself take some deep breaths and think hard about what I was doing. It was extremely unlikely that the vamps would give a Were the address of their daytime resting place. This was not information that vampires passed out to anyone who asked. Alcide had no love for the vamps of Shreveport, who\u0027d held his dad\u0027s gambling debt over Alcide\u0027s head until he complied with their wishes. I knew that if I called, he\u0027d come, because he was just a nice guy. But his involvement could have serious consequences for his family and his business. However, if this Hallow really was a triple threat - a Were witch who drank vampire blood - she was very dangerous, and the Weres of Shreveport should know about her. Relieved I\u0027d finally made up my mind, I found a pay phone that worked, and I got Alcide\u0027s card out of its slot in my billfold.\\n\\n Alcide was in his office, which was a miracle. I described my location, and he gave me directions on how to reach his office. He offered to come get me, but I didn\u0027t want him to think I was an utter idiot.\\n\\n I used a calling card to phone Bud Dearborn\u0027s office, to hear there was no news about Jason.\\n\\n Following Alcide\u0027s directions very carefully, I arrived at Herveaux and Son in about twenty minutes. It was not too far off I-30, on the eastern edge of Shreveport, actually on my way back to Bon Temps.\\n\\n The Herveauxes owned the building, and their surveying company was its sole occupant. I parked in front of the low brick building. At the rear, I spotted Alcide\u0027s Dodge Ram pickup in the large parking lot for employees. The one in front, for visitors, was much smaller. It was clear to see that the Herveauxes mostly went to their clients, rather than the clients coming to them.\\n\\n Feeling shy and more than a little nervous, I pushed open the front door and glanced around. There was a desk just inside the door, with a waiting area opposite. Beyond a half wall, I could see five or six workstations, three of them occupied. The woman behind the desk was in charge of routing phone calls, too. She had short dark brown hair that was carefully cut and styled, she was wearing a beautiful sweater, and she had wonderful makeup. She was probably in her forties, but it hadn\u0027t lessened her impressiveness.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m here to see Alcide,\" I said, feeling embarrassed and self-conscious.\\n\\n \"Your name?\" She was smiling at me, but she looked a little crisp around the edges, as if she didn\u0027t quite approve of a young and obviously unfashionable woman showing up at Alcide\u0027s workplace. I was wearing a bright blue-and-yellow knit top with long sleeves under my old thigh-length blue cloth coat, and aged blue jeans, and Reeboks. I\u0027d been worried about finding my brother when I dressed, not about standing inspection by the Fashion Police.\\n\\n \"Stackhouse,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Ms. Stackhouse here to see you,\" Crispy said into an intercom.\\n\\n \"Oh, good!\" Alcide sounded very happy, which was a relief.\\n\\n Crispy was saying into the intercom, \"Shall I send her back?\" when Alcide burst through the door behind and to the left of her desk.\\n\\n \"Sookie!\" he said, and he beamed at me. He stopped for a second, as if he couldn\u0027t quite decide what he should do, and then he hugged me.\\n\\n I felt like I was smiling all over. I hugged him back. I was so happy to see him! I thought he looked wonderful. Alcide is a tall man, with black hair that apparently can\u0027t be tamed with a brush and comb, and he has a broad face and green eyes.\\n\\n We\u0027d dumped a body together, and that creates a bond.\\n\\n He pulled gently on my braid. \"Come on back,\" he said in my ear, since Ms. Crispy was looking on with an indulgent smile. I was sure the indulgent part was for Alcide\u0027s benefit. In fact, I knew it was, because she was thinking I didn\u0027t look chic enough or polished enough to date a Herveaux, and she didn\u0027t think Alcide\u0027s dad (with whom she\u0027d been sleeping for two years) would appreciate Alcide taking up with a no-account girl like me. Oops, one of those things I didn\u0027t want to know. Obviously I wasn\u0027t shielding myself hard enough. Bill had made me practice, and now that I didn\u0027t see him anymore, I was getting sloppy. It wasn\u0027t entirely my fault; Ms. Crispy was a clear broadcaster.\\n\\n Alcide was not, since he\u0027s a werewolf.\\n\\n Alcide ushered me down a hall, which was nicely carpeted and hung with neutral pictures - insipid landscapes and garden scenes - which I figured some decorator (or maybe Ms. Crispy) had chosen. He showed me into his office, which had his name on the door. It was a big room, but not a grand or elegant one, because it was just chock-full of work stuff - plans and papers and hard hats and office equipment. Very utilitarian. A fax machine was humming, and set beside a stack of forms there was a calculator displaying figures.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re busy. I shouldn\u0027t have called,\" I said, instantly cowed.\\n\\n \"Are you kidding? Your call is the best thing that\u0027s happened to me all day!\" He sounded so sincere that I had to smile again. \"There\u0027s something I have to say to you, something I didn\u0027t tell you when I dropped your stuff off after you got hurt.\" After I\u0027d been beaten up by hired thugs. \"I felt so bad about it that I\u0027ve put off coming to Bon Temps to talk to you face-to-face.\"\\n\\n Omigod, he\u0027d gotten back with his nasty rotten fianc¨¦e, Debbie Pelt. I was getting Debbie\u0027s name from his brain.\\n\\n \"Yes?\" I said, trying to look calm and open. He reached down and took my hand between his own large palms.\\n\\n \"I owe you a huge apology.\"\\n\\n Okay, that was unexpected. \"How would that be?\" I asked, looking up at him with narrowed eyes. I\u0027d come here to spill my guts, but it was Alcide who was spilling his instead.\\n\\n \"That last night, at Club Dead,\" he began, \"when you needed my help and protection the most, I...\"\\n\\n I knew what was coming now. Alcide had changed into a wolf rather than staying human and helping me out of the bar after I\u0027d gotten staked. I put my free hand across his mouth. His skin was so warm. If you\u0027re used to touching vampires, you\u0027ll know just how roasty a regular human can feel, and a Were even more so, since they run a few degrees hotter.\\n\\n I felt my pulse quicken, and I knew he could tell, too. Animals are good at sensing excitement. \"Alcide,\" I said, \"never bring that up. You couldn\u0027t help it, and it all turned out okay, anyway.\" Well, more or less - other than my heart breaking at Bill\u0027s perfidy.\\n\\n \"Thanks for being so understanding,\" he said, after a pause during which he looked at me intently. \"I think I would have felt better if you\u0027d been mad.\" I believe he was wondering whether I was just putting a brave face on it or if I was truly sincere. I could tell he had an impulse to kiss me, but he wasn\u0027t sure if I\u0027d welcome such a move or even allow it.\\n\\n Well, I didn\u0027t know what I\u0027d do, either, so I didn\u0027t give myself the chance to find out.\\n\\n \"Okay, I\u0027m furious with you, but I\u0027m concealing it real well,\" I said. He relaxed all over when he saw me smile, though it might be the last smile we\u0027d share all day. \"Listen, your office in the middle of day isn\u0027t a good time and place to tell you the things I need to tell you,\" I said. I spoke very levelly, so he\u0027d realize I wasn\u0027t coming on to him. Not only did I just plain old like Alcide, I thought he was one hell of a man - but until I was sure he was through with Debbie Pelt, he was off my list of guys I wanted to be around. The last I\u0027d heard of Debbie, she\u0027d been engaged to another shifter, though even that hadn\u0027t ended her emotional involvement with Alcide.\\n\\n I was not going to get in the middle of that - not with the grief caused by Bill\u0027s infidelity still weighing heavily on my own heart.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s go to the Applebee\u0027s down the road and have some coffee,\" he suggested. Over the intercom, he told Crispy he was leaving. We went out through the back door.\\n\\n It was about two o\u0027clock by then, and the restaurant was almost empty. Alcide asked the young man who seated us to put us in a booth as far away from anyone else as we could get. I scooted down the bench on one side, expecting Alcide to take the other, but he slid in beside me. \"If you want to tell secrets, this is as close as we can get,\" he said.\\n\\n We both ordered coffee, and Alcide asked the server to bring a small pot. I inquired after his dad while the server was puttering around, and Alcide inquired after Jason. I didn\u0027t answer, because the mention of my brother\u0027s name was enough to make me feel close to crying. When our coffee had come and the young man had left, Alcide said, \"What\u0027s up?\"\\n\\n I took a deep breath, trying to decide where to begin. \"There\u0027s a bad witch coven in Shreveport,\" I said flatly. \"They drink vampire blood, and at least a few of them are shifters.\"\\n\\n It was Alcide\u0027s turn to take a deep breath.\\n\\n I help up a hand, indicating there was more to come. \"They\u0027re moving into Shreveport to take over the vampires\u0027 financial kingdom. They put a curse or a hex or something on Eric, and it took away his memory. They raided Fangtasia, trying to discover the day resting place of the vampires. They put some kind of spell on two of the waitresses, and one of them is in the hospital. The other one is dead.\"\\n\\n Alcide was already sliding his cell phone from his pocket.\\n\\n \"Pam and Chow have hidden Eric at my house, and I have to get back before dark to take care of him. And Jason is missing. I don\u0027t know who took him or where he is or if he\u0027s...\" Alive. But I couldn\u0027t say the word.\\n\\n Alcide\u0027s deep breath escaped in a whoosh, and he sat staring at me, the phone in his hand. He couldn\u0027t decide whom to call first. I didn\u0027t blame him.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like Eric being at your house,\" he said. \"It puts you in danger.\"\\n\\n I was touched that his first thought was for my safety. \"Jason asked for a lot of money for doing it, and Pam and Chow agreed,\" I said, embarrassed.\\n\\n \"But Jason isn\u0027t there to take the heat, and you are.\"\\n\\n Unanswerably true. But to give Jason credit, he certainly hadn\u0027t planned it that way. I told Alcide about the blood on the dock. \"Might be a red herring,\" he said. \"If the type matches Jason\u0027s, then you can worry.\" He took a sip of his coffee, his eyes focused inward. \"I\u0027ve got to make some calls,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Alcide, are you the packmaster for Shreveport?\"\\n\\n \"No, no, I\u0027m nowhere near important enough.\"\\n\\n That didn\u0027t seem possible to me, and I said as much. He took my hand.\\n\\n \"Packmasters are usually older than me,\" he said. \"And you have to be really tough. Really, really tough.\"\\n\\n \"Do you have to fight to get to be packmaster?\"\\n\\n \"No, you get elected, but the candidates have to be very strong and clever. There\u0027s a sort of - well, you have a test you have to take.\"\\n\\n \"Written? Oral?\" Alcide looked relieved when he saw I was smiling. \"More like an endurance test?\" I said.\\n\\n He nodded. \"More like.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you think your packmaster should know about this?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. What else?\"\\n\\n \"Why would they be doing this? Why pick on Shreveport? If they have that much going for them, the vampire blood and the will to do really bad things, why not set up shop in a more prosperous city?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a real good question.\" Alcide was thinking hard. His green eyes squinted when he thought. \"I\u0027ve never heard of a witch having this much power. I never heard of a witch being a shifter. I tend to think it\u0027s the first time this has ever happened.\"\\n\\n \"The first time?\"\\n\\n \"That a witch has ever tried to take control of a city, tried to take away the assets of the city\u0027s supernatural community,\" he said.\\n\\n \"How do witches stand in the supernatural pecking order?\"\\n\\n \"Well, they\u0027re humans who stay human.\" He shrugged. \"Usually, the Supes feel like witches are just wanna-bes. The kind you have to keep an eye on, since they practice magic and we\u0027re magical creatures, but still...\"\\n\\n \"Not a big threat?\"\\n\\n \"Right. Looks like we might have to rethink that. Their leader takes vampire blood. Does she drain them herself?\" He punched in a number and held the phone to his ear.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"And what does she shift into?\" Shape-shifters had a choice, but there was one animal each shifter had an affinity for, her habitual animal. A shape-shifter could call herself a \"were-lynx\" or a \"were-bat,\" if she was out of hearing range of a werewolf. Werewolves objected very strenuously to any other two-natured creatures who termed themselves \"Were.\"\\n\\n \"Well, she\u0027s... like you,\" I said. The Weres considered themselves the kings of the two-natured community. They only changed into one animal, and it was the best. The rest of the two-natured community responded by calling the wolves thugs.\\n\\n \"Oh, no.\" Alcide was appalled. At that moment, his packmaster answered the phone.\\n\\n \"Hello, this is Alcide.\" A silence. \"I\u0027m sorry to bother you when you were busy in the yard. Something important\u0027s come up. I need to see you as soon as possible.\" Another silence. \"Yes, sir. With your permission, I\u0027ll bring someone with me.\" After a second or two, Alcide pressed a button to end the conversation. \"Surely Bill knows where Pam and Chow live?\" he asked me.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure he does, but he\u0027s not here to tell me about it.\" If he would.\\n\\n \"And where is he?\" Alcide\u0027s voice was deceptively calm.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s in Peru.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d been looking down at my napkin, which I\u0027d pleated into a fan. I glanced up at the man next to me to see him staring down at me with an expression of incredulity.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s gone? He left you there alone?\"\\n\\n \"Well, he didn\u0027t know anything was going to happen,\" I said, trying not to sound defensive, and then I thought, What am I saying? \"Alcide, I haven\u0027t seen Bill since I came back from Jackson, except when he came over to tell me he was leaving the country.\"\\n\\n \"But she told me you were back with Bill,\" Alcide said in a very strange voice.\\n\\n \"Who told you that?\"\\n\\n \"Debbie. Who else?\"\\n\\n I\u0027m afraid my reaction was not very flattering. \"And you believed Debbie?\"\\n\\n \"She said she\u0027d stopped by Merlotte\u0027s on her way over to see me, and she\u0027d seen you and Bill acting very, ah, friendly while she was there.\"\\n\\n \"And you believed her?\" Maybe if I kept shifting the emphasis, he\u0027d tell me he was just joking.\\n\\n Alcide was looking sheepish now, or as sheepish as a werewolf can look.\\n\\n \"Okay, that was dumb,\" he admitted. \"I\u0027ll deal with her.\"\\n\\n \"Right.\" Pardon me if I didn\u0027t sound very convinced. I\u0027d heard that before.\\n\\n \"Bill\u0027s really in Peru?\"\\n\\n \"As far as I know.\"\\n\\n \"And you\u0027re alone in the house with Eric?\"\\n\\n \"Eric doesn\u0027t know he\u0027s Eric.\"\\n\\n \"He doesn\u0027t remember his identity?\"\\n\\n \"Nope. He doesn\u0027t remember his character, either, apparently.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a good thing,\" Alcide said darkly. He had never viewed Eric with any sense of humor, as I did. I\u0027d always been leery of Eric, but I\u0027d appreciated his mischief, his single-mindedness, and his flair. If you could say a vampire had joie de vivre, Eric had it in spades.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s go see the packmaster now,\" Alcide said, obviously in a much grimmer mood. We slid out of the booth after he\u0027d paid for the coffee, and without phoning in to work (\"No point being the boss if I can\u0027t vanish from time to time\"), he helped me up into his truck and we took off back into Shreveport. I was sure Ms. Crispy would assume we\u0027d checked into a motel or gone to Alcide\u0027s apartment, but that was better than Ms. Crispy finding out her boss was a werewolf.\\n\\n As we drove, Alcide told me that the packmaster was a retired Air Force colonel, formerly stationed at Barksdale Air Force Base in Bossier City, which flowed into Shreveport. Colonel Flood\u0027s only child, a daughter, had married a local, and Colonel Flood had settled in the city to be close to his grandchildren.\\n\\n \"His wife is a Were, too?\" I asked. If Mrs. Flood was also a Were, their daughter would be, too. If Weres can get through the first few months, they live a good long while, barring accidents.\\n\\n \"She was; she passed away a few months ago.\"\\n\\n Alcide\u0027s packmaster lived in a modest neighborhood of ranch-style homes on smallish lots. Colonel Flood was picking up pine cones in his front yard. It seemed a very domestic and peaceable thing for a prominent werewolf to be doing. I\u0027d pictured him in my head in an Air Force uniform, but of course he was wearing regular civilian outdoor clothes. His thick hair was white and cut very short, and he had a mustache that must have been trimmed with a ruler, it was so exact.\\n\\n The colonel must have been curious after Alcide\u0027s phone call, but he asked us to come inside in a calm sort of way. He patted Alcide on the back a lot; he was very polite to me.\\n\\n The house was as neat as his mustache. It could have passed inspection.\\n\\n \"Can I get you a drink? Coffee? Hot chocolate? Soda?\" The colonel gestured toward his kitchen as if there were a servant standing there alert for our orders.\\n\\n \"No, thank you,\" I said, since I was awash with Applebee\u0027s coffee. Colonel Flood insisted we sit in the company living room, which was an awkwardly narrow rectangle with a formal dining area at one end. Mrs. Flood had liked porcelain birds. She had liked them a lot. I wondered how the grandchildren fared in this room, and I kept my hands tucked in my lap for fear I\u0027d jostle something.\\n\\n \"So, what can I do for you?\" Colonel Flood asked Alcide. \"Are you seeking permission to marry?\"\\n\\n \"Not today,\" Alcide said with a smile. I looked down at the floor to keep my expression to myself. \"My friend Sookie has some information that she shared with me. It\u0027s very important.\" His smile died on the vine. \"She needs to relate what she knows to you.\"\\n\\n \"And why do I need to listen?\"\\n\\n I understood that he was asking Alcide who I was - that if he was obliged to listen to me, he needed to know my bona fides. But Alcide was offended on my behalf.\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t have brought her if it wasn\u0027t important. I wouldn\u0027t have introduced her to you if I wouldn\u0027t give my blood for her.\"\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t real certain what that meant, but I was interpreting it to assume Alcide was vouching for my truthfulness and offering to pay in some way if I proved false. Nothing was simple in the supernatural world.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s hear your story, young woman,\" said the colonel briskly.\\n\\n I related all I\u0027d told Alcide, trying to leave out the personal bits.\\n\\n \"Where is this coven staying?\" he asked me, when I was through. I told him what I\u0027d seen through Holly\u0027s mind.\\n\\n \"Not enough information,\" Flood said crisply. \"Alcide, we need the trackers.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\" Alcide\u0027s eyes were gleaming at the thought of action.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll call them. Everything I\u0027ve heard is making me rethink something odd that happened last night. Adabelle didn\u0027t come to the planning committee meeting.\"\\n\\n Alcide looked startled. \"That\u0027s not good.\"\\n\\n They were trying to be cryptic in front of me, but I could read what was passing between the two shifters without too much difficulty. Flood and Alcide were wondering if their - hmmm, vice president? - Adabelle had missed the meeting for some innocent reason, or if the new coven had somehow inveigled her into joining them against her own pack.\\n\\n \"Adabelle has been chafing against the pack leadership for some time,\" Colonel Flood told Alcide, with the ghost of a smile on his thin lips. \"I had hoped, when she got elected my second, that she\u0027d consider that concession enough.\"\\n\\n From the bits of information I could glean from the packmaster\u0027s mind, the Shreveport pack seemed to be heavily on the patriarchal side. To Adabelle, a modern woman, Colonel Flood\u0027s leadership was stifling.\\n\\n \"A new regime might appeal to her,\" Colonel Flood said, after a perceptible pause. \"If the invaders learned anything about our pack, it\u0027s Adabelle they\u0027d approach.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think Adabelle would ever betray the pack, no matter how unhappy she is with the status quo,\" Alcide said. He sounded very sure. \"But if she didn\u0027t come to the meeting last night, and you can\u0027t raise her by phone this morning, I\u0027m concerned.\"\\n\\n \"I wish you\u0027d go check on Adabelle while I alert the pack to action,\" Colonel Flood suggested. \"If your friend wouldn\u0027t mind.\"\\n\\n Maybe his friend would like to get her butt back to Bon Temps and see to her paying guest. Maybe his friend would like to be searching for her brother. Though truly, I could not think of a single thing to do that would further the search for Jason, and it would be at least two hours before Eric rose.\\n\\n Alcide said, \"Colonel, Sookie is not a pack member and she shouldn\u0027t have to shoulder pack responsibilities. She has her own troubles, and she\u0027s gone out of her way to let us know about a big problem we didn\u0027t even realize we had. We should have known. Someone in our pack hasn\u0027t been honest with us.\"\\n\\n Colonel Flood\u0027s face drew in on itself as if he\u0027d swallowed a live eel. \"You\u0027re right about that,\" he said. \"Thank you, Miss Stackhouse, for taking the time to come to Shreveport and to tell Alcide about our problem... which we should have known.\"\\n\\n I nodded to him in acknowledgment.\\n\\n \"And I think you\u0027re right, Alcide. One of us must have known about the presence of another pack in the city.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll call you about Adabelle,\" Alcide said.\\n\\n The colonel picked up the phone and consulted a red leather book before he dialed. He glanced sideways at Alcide. \"No answer at her shop.\" He had as much warmth radiating from him as a little space heater. Since Colonel Flood kept his house about as cold as the great outdoors, the heat was quite welcome.\\n\\n \"Sookie should be named a friend of the pack.\"\\n\\n I could tell that was more than a recommendation. Alcide was saying something quite significant, but he sure wasn\u0027t going to explain. I was getting a little tired of the elliptical conversations going on around me.\\n\\n \"Excuse me, Alcide, Colonel,\" I said as politely as I could. \"Maybe Alcide could run me back to my car? Since you all seem to have plans to carry out.\"\\n\\n \"Of course,\" the colonel said, and I could read that he was glad to be getting me out of the way. \"Alcide, I\u0027ll see you back here in, what? Forty minutes or so? We\u0027ll talk about it then.\"\\n\\n Alcide glanced at his watch and reluctantly agreed. \"I might stop by Adabelle\u0027s house while I\u0027m taking Sookie to her car,\" he said, and the colonel nodded, as if that were only pro forma.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know why Adabelle isn\u0027t answering the phone at work, and I don\u0027t believe she\u0027d go over to the coven,\" Alcide explained when we were back in his truck. \"Adabelle lives with her mother, and they don\u0027t get along too well. But we\u0027ll check there first. Adabelle\u0027s Flood\u0027s second in command, and she\u0027s also our best tracker.\"\\n\\n \"What can the trackers do?\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027ll go to Fangtasia and try to follow the scent trail the witches left there. That\u0027ll take them to the witches\u0027 lair. If they lose the scent, maybe we can call in help from the Shreveport covens. They have to be as worried as we are.\"\\n\\n \"At Fangtasia, I\u0027m afraid any scent might be obscured by all the emergency people,\" I said regretfully. That would have been something to watch, a Were tracking through the city. \"And just so you know, Hallow has contacted all the witches hereabouts already. I talked to a Wiccan in Bon Temps who\u0027d been called in to Shreveport to meet with Hallow\u0027s bunch.\"\\n\\n \"This is bigger than I thought, but I\u0027m sure the pack can handle it.\" Alcide sounded quite confident.\\n\\n Alcide backed the truck out of the colonel\u0027s driveway, and we began making our way through Shreveport once again. I was seeing more of the city this day than I\u0027d seen in my whole life.\\n\\n \"Whose idea was it for Bill to go to Peru?\" Alcide asked me suddenly.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" I was startled and puzzled. \"I think it was his queen\u0027s.\"\\n\\n \"But he didn\u0027t tell you that directly.\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"He might have been ordered to go.\"\\n\\n \"I suppose.\"\\n\\n \"Who had the power to do that?\" Alcide asked, as if the answer would enlighten me.\\n\\n \"Eric, of course.\" Since Eric was sheriff of Area Five. \"And then the queen.\" That would be Eric\u0027s boss, the queen of Louisiana. Yeah, I know. It\u0027s dumb. But the vampires thought they were a marvel of modern organization.\\n\\n \"And now Bill\u0027s gone, and Eric\u0027s staying at your house.\" Alcide\u0027s voice was coaxing me to reach an obvious conclusion.\\n\\n \"You think that Eric staged this whole thing? You think he ordered Bill out of the country, had witches invade Shreveport, had them curse him, began running half-naked out in the freezing cold when he supposed I might be near, and then just hoped I\u0027d take him in and that Pam and Chow and my brother would talk to each other to arrange Eric\u0027s staying with me?\"\\n\\n Alcide looked properly flattened. \"You mean you\u0027d thought of this?\"\\n\\n \"Alcide, I\u0027m not educated, but I\u0027m not dumb.\" Try getting educated when you can read the minds of all your classmates, not to mention your teacher. But I read a lot, and I\u0027ve read lots of good stuff. Of course, now I read mostly mysteries and romances. So I\u0027ve learned many curious odds and ends, and I have a great vocabulary. \"But the fact is, Eric would hardly go to this much trouble to get me to go to bed with him. Is that what you\u0027re thinking?\" Of course, I knew it was. Were or not, I could see that much.\\n\\n \"Put that way...\" But Alcide still didn\u0027t look satisfied. Of course, this was the man who had believed Debbie Pelt when she said that I was definitely back with Bill.\\n\\n I wondered if I could get some witch to cast a truth spell on Debbie Pelt, whom I despised because she had been cruel to Alcide, insulted me grievously, burned a hole in my favorite wrap and - oh - tried to kill me by proxy. Also, she had stupid hair.\\n\\n Alcide wouldn\u0027t know an honest Debbie if she came up and bit him in the ass, though backbiting was a specialty of the real Debbie.\\n\\n If Alcide had known Bill and I had parted, would he have come by? Would one thing have led to another?\\n\\n Well, sure it would have. And there I\u0027d be, stuck with a guy who\u0027d take the word of Debbie Pelt.\\n\\n I glanced over at Alcide and sighed. This man was just about perfect in many respects. I liked the way he looked, I understood the way he thought, and he treated me with great consideration and respect. Sure, he was a werewolf, but I could give up a couple of nights of month. True, according to Alcide it would be difficult for me to carry his baby to term, but it was at least possible. Pregnancy wasn\u0027t part of the picture with a vampire.\\n\\n Whoa. Alcide hadn\u0027t offered to father my babies, and he was still seeing Debbie. What had happened to her engagement to the Clausen guy?\\n\\n With the less noble side of my character - assuming my character had a noble side - I hoped that someday soon Alcide would see Debbie for the bitch she truly was, and that he\u0027d finally take the knowledge to heart. Whether, consequently, Alcide turned to me or not, he deserved better than Debbie Pelt.\\n\\n Adabelle Yancy and her mother lived in a cul-de-sac in an upper-middle-class neighborhood that wasn\u0027t too far from Fangtasia. The house was on a rolling lawn that raised it higher than the street, so the driveway mounted and went to the rear of the property. I thought Alcide might park on the street and we\u0027d go up the brick walkway to the front door, but he seemed to want to get the truck out of sight. I scanned the cul-de-sac, but I didn\u0027t see anyone at all, much less anyone watching the house for visitors.\\n\\n Attached to the rear of the house at a right angle, the three-car garage was neat as a pin. You would think cars were never parked there, that the gleaming Subaru had just strayed into the area. We climbed out of the truck.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s Adabelle\u0027s mother\u0027s car,\" Alcide was frowning. \"She started a bridal shop. I bet you\u0027ve heard of it - Verena Rose. Verena\u0027s retired from working there full-time. She drops in just often enough to make Adabelle crazy.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d never been to the shop, but brides of any claim to prominence in the area made a point of shopping there. It must be a real profitable store. The brick home was in excellent shape, and no more than twenty years old. The yard was edged, raked, and landscaped.\\n\\n When Alcide knocked at the back door, it flew open. The woman who stood revealed in the opening was as put-together and neat as the house and yard. Her steel-colored hair was in a neat roll on the back of her head, and she was in a dull olive suit and low-heeled brown pumps. She looked from Alcide to me and didn\u0027t find what she was seeking. She pushed open the glass storm door.\\n\\n \"Alcide, how nice to see you,\" she lied desperately. This was a woman in deep turmoil.\\n\\n Alcide gave her a long look. \"We have trouble, Verena.\"\\n\\n If her daughter was a member of the pack, Verena herself was a werewolf. I looked at the woman curiously, and she seemed like one of the more fortunate friends of my grandmother\u0027s. Verena Rose Yancy was an attractive woman in her late sixties, blessed with a secure income and her own home. I could not imagine this woman down on all fours loping across a field.\\n\\n And it was obvious that Verena didn\u0027t give a damn what trouble Alcide had. \"Have you seen my daughter?\" she asked, and she waited for his answer with terror in her eyes. \"She can\u0027t have betrayed the pack.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Alcide said. \"But the packmaster sent us to find her. She missed a pack officer\u0027s meeting last night.\"\\n\\n \"She called me from the shop last night. She said she had an unexpected appointment with a stranger who\u0027d called the shop right at closing time.\" The woman literally wrung her hands. \"I thought maybe she was meeting that witch.\"\\n\\n \"Have you heard from her since?\" I said, in the gentlest voice I could manage.\\n\\n \"I went to bed last night mad at her,\" Verena said, looking directly at me for the first time. \"I thought she\u0027d decided to spend the night with one of her friends. One of her girl friends,\" she explained, looking at me with eyebrows arched, so I\u0027d get her drift. I nodded. \"She never would tell me ahead of time, she\u0027d just say, \u0027Expect me when you see me,\u0027 or \u0027I\u0027ll meet you at the shop tomorrow morning,\u0027 or something.\" A shudder rippled through Verena\u0027s slim body. \"But she hasn\u0027t come home and I can\u0027t get an answer at the shop.\"\\n\\n \"Was she supposed to open the shop today?\" Alcide asked.\\n\\n \"No, Wednesday\u0027s our closed day, but she always goes in to work on the books and get paperwork out of the way. She always does,\" Verena repeated.\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t Alcide and I drive over there and check the shop for you?\" I said gently. \"Maybe she left a note.\" This was not a woman you patted on the arm, so I didn\u0027t make that natural gesture, but I did push the glass door shut so she\u0027d understand she had to stay there and she shouldn\u0027t come with us. She understood all too clearly.\\n\\n Verena Rose\u0027s Bridal and Formal Shop was located in an old home on a block of similarly converted two-story houses. The building had been renovated and maintained as beautifully as the Yancys\u0027 residence, and I wasn\u0027t surprised it had such cachet. The white-painted brick, the dark green shutters, the glossy black ironwork of the railings on the steps, and the brass details on the door all spoke of elegance and attention to detail. I could see that if you had aspirations to class, this is where you\u0027d come to get your wedding gear.\\n\\n Set a little back from the street, with parking behind the store, the building featured one large bay window in front. In this window stood a faceless mannequin wearing a shining brown wig. Her arms were gracefully bent to hold a stunning bouquet. Even from the truck, I could see that the bridal dress, with its long embroidered train, was absolutely spectacular.\\n\\n We parked in the driveway without pulling around back, and I jumped out of the pickup. Together we took the brick sidewalk that led from the drive to the front door, and as we got closer, Alcide cursed. For a moment, I imagined some kind of bug infestation had gotten into the store window and landed on the snowy dress. But after that moment, I knew the dark flecks were surely spatters of blood.\\n\\n The blood had sprayed onto the white brocade and dried there. It was as if the mannequin had been wounded, and for a crazy second I wondered. I\u0027d seen a lot of impossible things in the past few months.\\n\\n \"Adabelle,\" Alcide said, as if he was praying.\\n\\n We were standing at the bottom of the steps leading up to the front porch, staring into the bay window. The CLOSED sign was hanging in the middle of the glass oval inset in the door, and Venetian blinds were closed behind it. There were no live brainwaves emanating from that house. I had taken the time to check. I\u0027d discovered, the hard way, that checking was a good idea.\\n\\n \"Dead things,\" Alcide said, his face raised to the cold breeze, his eyes shut to help him concentrate. \"Dead things inside and out.\"\\n\\n I took hold of the curved ironwork handrail with my left hand and went up one step. I glanced around. My eyes came to rest on something in the flowerbed under the bay window, something pale that stood out against the pine bark mulch. I nudged Alcide, and I pointed silently with my free right hand.\\n\\n Lying by a pruned-back azalea, there was another hand - an unattached extra. I felt a shudder run through Alcide\u0027s body as he comprehended what he saw. There was that moment when you tried to recognize it as anything but what it was.\\n\\n \"Wait here,\" Alcide said, his voice thick and hoarse.\\n\\n That was just fine with me.\\n\\n But when he opened the unlocked front door to enter the shop, I saw what lay on the floor just beyond. I had to swallow a scream.\\n\\n It was lucky Alcide had his cell phone. He called Colonel Flood, told him what had happened, and asked him to go over to Mrs. Yancy\u0027s house. Then he called the police. There was just no way around it. This was a busy area, and there was a good chance someone had noticed us going to the front door.\\n\\n It was surely a day for finding bodies - for me, and for the Shreveport police department. I knew there were some vampire cops on the force, but of course the vamps had to work the night shift, so we spoke to regular old human cops. There wasn\u0027t a Were or a shifter among \u0027em, not even a telepathic human. All these police officers were regular people who thought we were borderline suspicious.\\n\\n \"Why did you stop by here, buddy?\" asked Detective Coughlin, who had brown hair, a weathered face, and a beer belly one of the Clydesdales would\u0027ve been proud of.\\n\\n Alcide looked surprised. He hadn\u0027t thought this far, which wasn\u0027t too amazing. I hadn\u0027t known Adabelle when she was alive, and I hadn\u0027t stepped inside the bridal shop as he had. I hadn\u0027t sustained the worst shock. It was up to me to pick up the reins.\\n\\n \"It was my idea, Detective,\" I said instantly. \"My grandmother, who died last year? She always told me, \u0027If you need a wedding dress, Sookie, you go to Verena Rose\u0027s for it.\u0027 I didn\u0027t think to call ahead and check to see if they were open today.\"\\n\\n \"So, you and Mr. Herveaux are going to be married?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Alcide, pulling me against him and wrapping his arms around me. \"We\u0027re headed for the altar.\"\\n\\n I smiled, but in an appropriately subdued way.\\n\\n \"Well, congratulations.\" Detective Coughlin eyed us thoughtfully. \"So, Miss Stackhouse, you hadn\u0027t ever met Adabelle Yancy face-to-face?\"\\n\\n \"I may have met the older Mrs. Yancy when I was a little girl,\" I said cautiously. \"But I don\u0027t remember her. Alcide\u0027s family knows the Yancys, of course. He\u0027s lived here all his life.\" Of course, they\u0027re also werewolves.\\n\\n Coughlin was still focused on me. \"And you didn\u0027t go in the shop none? Just Mr. Herveaux here?\"\\n\\n \"Alcide just stepped in while I waited out here.\" I tried to look delicate, which is not easy for me. I am healthy and muscular, and while I am not Emme, I\u0027m not Kate Moss either. \"I\u0027d seen the - the hand, so I stayed out.\"\\n\\n \"That was a good idea,\" Detective Coughlin said. \"What\u0027s in there isn\u0027t fit for people to see.\" He looked about twenty years older as he said that. I felt sorry that his job was so tough. He was thinking that the savaged bodies in the house were a waste of two good lives and the work of someone he\u0027d love to arrest. \"Would either of you have any idea why anyone would want to rip up two ladies like this?\"\\n\\n \"Two,\" Alcide said slowly, stunned.\\n\\n \"Two?\" I said, less guardedly.\\n\\n \"Why, yes,\" the detective said heavily. He had aimed to get our reactions and now he had them; what he thought of them, I would find out.\\n\\n \"Poor things,\" I said, and I wasn\u0027t faking the tears that filled my eyes. It was kind of nice to have Alcide\u0027s chest to lean against, and as if he were reading my mind he unzipped his leather jacket so I\u0027d be closer to him, wrapping the open sides around me to keep me warmer. \"But if one of them is Adabelle Yancy, who is the other?\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s not much left of the other,\" Coughlin said, before he told himself to shut his mouth.\\n\\n \"They were kind of jumbled up,\" Alcide said quietly, close to my ear. He was sickened. \"I didn\u0027t know... I guess if I\u0027d analyzed what I was seeing...\"\\n\\n Though I couldn\u0027t read Alcide\u0027s thoughts clearly, I could understand that he was thinking that Adabelle had managed to take down one of her attackers. And when the rest of the group was getting away, they hadn\u0027t taken all the appropriate bits with them.\\n\\n \"And you\u0027re from Bon Temps, Miss Stackhouse,\" the detective said, almost idly.\\n\\n \"Yes, sir,\" I said, with a gasp. I was trying not to picture Adabelle Yancy\u0027s last moments.\\n\\n \"Where you work there?\"\\n\\n \"Merlotte\u0027s Bar and Grill,\" I said. \"I wait tables.\"\\n\\n While he registered the difference in social status between me and Alcide, I closed my eyes and laid my head against Alcide\u0027s warm chest. Detective Coughlin was wondering if I was pregnant; if Alcide\u0027s dad, a well-known and well-to-do figure in Shreveport, would approve of such a marriage. He could see why I\u0027d want an expensive wedding dress, if I were marrying a Herveaux.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have an engagement ring, Miss Stackhouse?\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t plan on a long engagement,\" Alcide said. I could hear his voice rumbling in his chest. \"She\u0027ll get her diamond the day we marry.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re so bad,\" I said fondly, punching him in the ribs as hard as I could without being obvious.\\n\\n \"Ouch,\" he said in protest.\\n\\n Somehow this bit of byplay convinced Detective Coughlin that we were really engaged. He took down our phone numbers and addresses, then told us we could leave. Alcide was as relieved as I was.\\n\\n We drove to the nearest place where we could pull over in privacy - a little park that was largely deserted in the cold weather - and Alcide called Colonel Flood again. I waited in the truck while Alcide, pacing in the dead grass, gesticulated and raised his voice, venting some of his horror and anger. I\u0027d been able to feel it building up in him. Alcide had trouble articulating emotions, like lots of guys. It made him seem more familiar and dear.\\n\\n Dear? I\u0027d better stop thinking like that. The engagement had been drummed up strictly for Detective Coughlin\u0027s benefit. If Alcide was anyone\u0027s \"dear,\" it was the perfidious Debbie\u0027s.\\n\\n When Alcide climbed back into the pickup, he was scowling.\\n\\n \"I guess I better go back to the office and take you to your car,\" he said. \"I\u0027m sorry about all this.\"\\n\\n \"I guess I should be saying that.\"\\n\\n \"This is a situation neither of us created,\" he said firmly. \"Neither of us would be involved if we could help it.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the God\u0027s truth.\" After a minute of thinking of the complicated supernatural world, I asked Alcide what Colonel Flood\u0027s plan was.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll take care of it,\" Alcide said. \"I\u0027m sorry, Sook, I can\u0027t tell you what we\u0027re going to do.\"\\n\\n \"Are you going to be in danger?\" I asked, because I just couldn\u0027t help it.\\n\\n We\u0027d gotten to the Herveaux building by then, and Alcide parked his truck by my old car. He turned a little to face me, and he reached over to take my hand. \"I\u0027m gonna be fine. Don\u0027t worry,\" he said gently. \"I\u0027ll call you.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t forget to do that,\" I said. \"And I have to tell you what the witches did about trying to find Eric.\" I hadn\u0027t told Alcide about the posted pictures, the reward. He frowned even harder when he thought about the cleverness of this ploy.\\n\\n \"Debbie was supposed to drive over this afternoon, get here about six,\" he said. He looked at his watch. \"Too late to stop her coming.\"\\n\\n \"If you\u0027re planning a big raid, she could help,\" I said.\\n\\n He gave me a sharp look. Like a pointed stick he wanted to poke in my eye. \"She\u0027s a shifter, not a Were,\" he reminded me defensively.\\n\\n Maybe she turned into a weasel or a rat.\\n\\n \"Of course,\" I said seriously. I literally bit my tongue so I wouldn\u0027t make any of the remarks that waited just inside my mouth, dying to be spoken. \"Alcide, do you think the other body was Adabelle\u0027s girlfriend? Someone who just got caught at the shop with Adabelle when the witches came calling?\"\\n\\n \"Since a lot of the second body was missing, I hope that the body was one of the witches. I hope Adabelle went down fighting.\"\\n\\n \"I hope so, too.\" I nodded, putting an end to that train of thought. \"I\u0027d better get back to Bon Temps. Eric will be waking up soon. Don\u0027t forget to tell your dad that we\u0027re engaged.\"\\n\\n His expression provided the only fun I\u0027d had all day. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-to-the-world-sookie-stackhouse-4/page-6.html","bookId":2194,"book":{"id":2194,"title":"Dead to the World (Sookie Stackhouse #4)","description":"Storyline: Dead to the World (Sookie Stackhouse #4) \\n Sookie Stackhouse is a cocktail waitress in Bon Temps, Louisiana. She has only a few close friends, because not everyone appreciates Sookie’s gift: she can read minds. That’s not exactly every man’s idea of date bait – unless they’re undead; vampires and the like can be tough to read. And that’s just the kind of guy Sookie’s been looking for. Maybe that’s why, when she comes across a naked vampire, she doesn’t just drive on by. He hasn’t got a clue who he is, but Sookie has: Eric looks just as scary and sexy – and dead – as ever. But now he has amnesia, he’s sweet, vulnerable, and in need of Sookie’s help – because whoever took his memory now wants his life.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/dead-to-the-world-sookie-stackhouse-4.jpg","author":"Charlaine Harris","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/dead-to-the-world-sookie-stackhouse-4.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:26 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:55:56 PM"}}
