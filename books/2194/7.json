{"id":100765,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"6 I thought all the way home about my day in Shreveport. I\u0027d asked Alcide to call the cops in Bon Temps from his cell phone, and he\u0027d gotten another negative message. No, they hadn\u0027t heard any more on Jason, and no one had called to say they\u0027d seen him. So I didn\u0027t stop by the police station on my way home, but I did have to go to the grocery to buy some margarine and bread, and I did have to go in the liquor store to pick up some blood. The first thing I saw when I pushed open the door of Super Save-A-Bunch was a little display of bottled blood, which saved me a stop at the liquor store. The second thing I saw was the poster with the headshot of Eric. I assumed it was the photo Eric had had made when he opened Fangtasia, because it was a very nonthreatening picture. He was projecting winsome worldliness; any person in this universe would know that he\u0027d never, ever bite. It was headed, \"HAVE YOU SEEN THIS VAMPIRE?\" I read the text carefully. Everything Jason had said about it was true. Fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money. That Hallow must be really nuts about Eric to pay that much, if all she wanted was a hump. It was hard to believe gaining control of Fangtasia (and having the bed services of Eric) would afford her a profit after paying out a reward that large. I was increasingly doubtful that I knew the whole story, and I was increasingly sure I was sticking my neck out and might get it bitten off. Hoyt Fortenberry, Jason\u0027s big buddy, was loading pizzas into his buggy in the frozen food aisle. \"Hey, Sookie, where you think ole Jason got to?\" he called as soon as he saw me. Hoyt, big and beefy and no rocket scientist, looked genuinely concerned. \"I wish I knew,\" I said, coming closer so we could talk without everyone in the store recording every word. \"I\u0027m pretty worried.\" \"You don\u0027t think he\u0027s just gone off with some girl he met? That girl he was with New Year\u0027s Eve was pretty cute.\" \"What was her name?\" \"Crystal. Crystal Norris.\" \"Where\u0027s she from?\" \"From round Hotshot, out thataway.\" He nodded south. Hotshot was even smaller than Bon Temps. It was about ten miles away and had a reputation for being a strange little community. The Hotshot kids who attended the Bon Temps school always stuck together, and they were all a smidge... different. It didn\u0027t surprise me at all that Crystal lived in Hotshot. \"So,\" Hoyt said, persisting in making his point, \"Crystal might have asked him to come stay with her.\" But his brain was saying he didn\u0027t believe it, he was only trying to comfort me and himself. We both knew that Jason would have phoned by now, no matter how good a time he was having with any woman. But I decided I\u0027d give Crystal a call when I had a clear ten minutes, which might not be any time tonight. I asked Hoyt to pass on Crystal\u0027s name to the sheriff\u0027s department, and he said he would. He didn\u0027t seem too happy about the idea. I could tell that if the missing man had been anyone but Jason, Hoyt would have refused. But Jason had always been Hoyt\u0027s source of recreation and general amusement, since Jason was far more clever and inventive than the slow-moving, slow-thinking Hoyt: If Jason never reappeared, Hoyt would have a dull life. We parted in the Super Save-A-Bunch parking lot, and I felt relieved that Hoyt hadn\u0027t asked me about the TrueBlood I\u0027d purchased. Neither had the cashier, though she\u0027d handled the bottles with distaste. As I\u0027d paid for it, I\u0027d thought about how much I was in the hole from hosting Eric already. Clothes and blood mounted up. It was just dark when I got to my house and pulled the plastic grocery bags out of the car. I unlocked my back door and went in, calling to Eric as I switched on the kitchen light. I didn\u0027t hear an answer, so I put the groceries away, leaving a bottle of TrueBlood out of the refrigerator so he could have it to hand when he got hungry. I got the shotgun out of my trunk and loaded it, sticking it in the shadow of the water heater. I took a minute to call the sheriff\u0027s department again. No news of Jason, said the dispatcher. I slumped against the kitchen wall for a long moment, feeling dejected. It wasn\u0027t a good thing to just sit around, being depressed. Maybe I\u0027d go out to the living room and pop a movie into the VCR, as entertainment for Eric. He\u0027d gone through all my Buffy tapes, and I didn\u0027t have Angel. I wondered if he\u0027d like Gone with the Wind. (For all I knew, he\u0027d been around when they were filming it. On the other hand, he had amnesia. Anything should be new to him.) But as I went down the hall, I heard some small movement. I pushed open the door of my old room gently, not wanting to make a big noise if my guest wasn\u0027t yet up. Oh, but he was. Eric was pulling on his jeans, with his back to me. He hadn\u0027t bothered with underwear, not even the itty-bitty red ones. My breath stuck in my throat. I made a sound like \"Guck,\" and made myself close my eyes tight. I clenched my fists. If there were an international butt competition, Eric would win, hands down - or cheeks up. He would get a large, large trophy. I had never realized a woman could have to struggle to keep her hands off a man, but here I was, digging my nails into my palms, staring at the inside of my eyelids as though I could maybe see through them if I peered hard enough. It was somehow degrading, craving someone so... so voraciously - another good calendar word - just because he was physically beautiful. I hadn\u0027t thought that was something women did, either. \"Sookie, are you all right?\" Eric asked. I floundered my way back to sanity through a swamp of lust. He was standing right in front of me, his hands resting on my shoulders. I looked up into his blue eyes, now focused on me and apparently full of nothing but concern. I was right on a level with his hard nipples. They were the size of pencil erasers. I bit the inside of my lip. I would not lean over those few inches. \"Excuse me,\" I said, speaking very softly. I was scared to speak loudly, or move at all. If I did, I might knock him down. \"I didn\u0027t mean to walk in on you. I should have knocked.\" \"You have seen all of me before.\" Not the rear view, bare. \"Yes, but intruding wasn\u0027t polite.\" \"I don\u0027t mind. You look upset.\" You think? \"Well, I have had a very bad day,\" I said, through clenched teeth. \"My brother is missing, and the Were witches in Shreveport killed the - the vice president of the Were pack there, and her hand was in the flowerbed. Well, someone\u0027s was. Belinda\u0027s in the hospital. Ginger is dead. I think I\u0027ll take a shower.\" I turned on my heel and marched into my room. I went in the bathroom and shucked my clothes, tossing them into the hamper. I bit my lip until I could smile at my own streak of wildness, and then I climbed into the spray of hot water. I know cold showers are more traditional, but I was enjoying the warmth and relaxation the heat brought. I got my hair wet and groped for the soap. \"I\u0027ll do that for you,\" Eric said, pulling back the curtain to step into the shower with me. I gasped, just short of a shriek. He had discarded the jeans. He was also in the mood, the same mood I was in. You could really tell, with Eric. His fangs were out some, too. I was embarrassed, horrified, and absolutely ready to jump him. While I stood stock-still, paralyzed by conflicting waves of emotion, Eric took the soap out of my hands and lathered up his own, set the soap back in its little niche, and began to wash my arms, raising each in turn to stroke my armpit, down my side, never touching my breasts, which were practically quivering like puppies who wanted to be petted. \"Have we ever made love?\" he asked. I shook my head, still unable to speak. \"Then I was a fool,\" he said, moving one hand in a circular motion over my stomach. \"Turn around, lover.\" I turned my back to him, and he began to work on that. His fingers were very strong and very clever, and I had the most relaxed and cleanest set of shoulder blades in Louisiana by the time Eric got through. My shoulder blades were the only thing at ease. My libido was hopping up and down. Was I really going to do this? It seemed more and more likely that I was, I thought nervously. If the man in my shower had been the real Eric, I would have had the strength to back off. I would have ordered him out the minute he stepped in. The real Eric came with a whole package of power and politics, something of which I had limited understanding and interest. This was a different Eric - without the personality that I\u0027d grown fond of, in a perverse way - but it was beautiful Eric, who desired me, who was hungry for me, in a world that often let me know it could do very well without me. My mind was about to switch off and my body was about to take over. I could feel part of Eric pressed against my back, and he wasn\u0027t standing that close. Yikes. Yahoo. Yum. He shampooed my hair next. \"Are you trembling because you are frightened of me?\" he asked. I considered that. Yes, and no. But I wasn\u0027t about to have a long discussion over the pros and cons. The inner debate had been tough enough. Oh, yeah, I know, there wouldn\u0027t be a better time to have a long yada-yada with Eric about the moral aspects of mating with someone you didn\u0027t love. And maybe there would never be another time to lay ground rules about being careful to be gentle with me physically. Not that I thought Eric would beat me up, but his manhood (as my romance novels called it - in this case the popular adjectives \"burgeoning\" or \"throbbing\" might also be applied) was a daunting prospect to a relatively inexperienced woman like me. I felt like a car that had only been operated by one driver... a car its new prospective buyer was determined to take to the Daytona 500. Oh, to hell with thinking. I took the soap from the niche and lathered up my fingers. As I stepped very close to him, I kind of folded Mr. Happy up against Eric\u0027s stomach, so I could reach around him and get my fingers on that absolutely gorgeous butt. I couldn\u0027t look him in the face, but he let me know he was delighted that I was responding. He spread his legs obligingly and I washed him very thoroughly, very meticulously. He began to make little noises, to rock forward. I began to work on his chest. I closed my lips around his right nipple and sucked. He liked that a lot. His hands pressed against the back of my head. \"Bite, a little,\" he whispered, and I used my teeth. His hands began to move restlessly over whatever bit of my skin they could find, stroking and teasing. When he pulled away, he had decided to reciprocate, and he bent down. While his mouth closed over my breast, his hand glided between my legs. I gave a deep sigh, and did a little moving of my own. He had long fingers. The next thing I knew, the water was off and he was drying me with a fluffy white towel, and I was rubbing him with another one. Then we just kissed for while, over and over. \"The bed,\" he said, a little raggedly, and I nodded. He scooped me up and then we got into a kind of tangle with me trying to pull the bedspread down while he just wanted to dump me on the bed and proceed, but I had my way because it was just too cold for the top of the bed. Once we were arranged, I turned to him and we picked back up where we\u0027d left off, but with an escalating tempo. His fingers and his mouth were busy learning my topography, and he pressed heavily against my thigh. I was so on fire for him I was surprised that flames didn\u0027t flicker out of my fingertips. I curled my fingers around him and stroked. Suddenly Eric was on top of me, about to enter. I was exhilarated and very ready. I reached between us to put him at just the right spot, rubbing the tip of him over my nub as I did so. \"My lover,\" he said hoarsely, and pushed. Though I\u0027d been sure I was prepared, and I ached with wanting him, I cried out with the shock of it. After a moment, he said, \"Don\u0027t close your eyes. Look at me, lover.\" The way he said \"lover\" was like a caress, like he was calling me by a name no other man had ever used before or ever would after. His fangs were completely extended and I stretched up to run my tongue over them. I expected he would bite my neck, as Bill nearly always did. \"Watch me,\" he said in my ear, and pulled out. I tried to yank him back, but he began kissing his way down my body, making strategic stops, and I was hovering on the golden edge when he got all the way down. His mouth was talented, and his fingers took the place of his penis, and then all of a sudden he looked up the length of my body to make sure I was watching - I was - and he turned his face to my inner thigh, nuzzling it, his fingers moving steadily now, faster and faster, and then he bit. I may have made a noise, I am sure I did, but in the next second I was floating on the most powerful wave of pleasure I\u0027d ever felt. And the minute the shining wave subsided, Eric was kissing my mouth again, and I could taste my own fluids on him, and then he was back inside me, and it happened all over again. His moment came right after, as I was still experiencing aftershocks. He shouted something in a language I\u0027d never heard, and he closed his own eyes, and then he collapsed on top of me. After a couple of minutes, he raised his head to look down. I wished he would pretend to breathe, as Bill always had during sex. (I\u0027d never asked him, he\u0027d just done it, and it had been reassuring.) I pushed the thought away. I\u0027d never had sex with anyone but Bill, and I guess it was natural to think of that, but the truth was it hurt to remember my previous one-man status, now gone for good. I yanked myself back into The Moment, which was fine enough. I stroked Eric\u0027s hair, tucking some behind his ear. His eyes on mine were intent, and I knew he was waiting for me to speak. \"I wish,\" I said, \"I could save orgasms in a jar for when I need them, because I think I had a few extra.\" Eric\u0027s eyes widened, and all of a sudden he roared with laughter. That sounded good, that sounded like the real Eric. I felt comfortable with this gorgeous but unknown stranger, after I heard that laugh. He rolled onto his back and swung me over easily until I was straddling his waist. \"If I had known you would be this gorgeous with your clothes off, I would have tried to do this sooner,\" he said. \"You did try to do this sooner, about twenty times,\" I said, smiling down at him. \"Then I have good taste.\" He hesitated for a long minute, some of the pleasure leaving his face. \"Tell me about us. How long have I known you?\" The light from the bathroom spilled onto the right side of his face. His hair spread over my pillow, shining and golden. \"I\u0027m cold,\" I said gently, and he let me lie beside him, pulling the covers up over us. I propped myself up on one elbow and he lay on his side, so we were facing each other. \"Let me think. I met you last year at Fangtasia, the vampire bar you own in Shreveport. And by the way, the bar got attacked today. Last night. I\u0027m sorry, I should have told you that first, but I\u0027ve been so worried about my brother.\" \"I want to hear about today, but give me our background first. I find myself mightily interested.\" Another little shock: The real Eric cared about his own position first, relationships down about - oh, I don\u0027t know, tenth. This was definitely odd. I told him, \"You are the sheriff of Area Five, and my former boyfriend Bill is your subordinate. He\u0027s gone, out of the country. I think I told you about Bill.\" \"Your unfaithful former boyfriend? Whose maker was the vampire Lorena?\" \"That\u0027s the one,\" I said briefly. \"Anyway, when I met you at Fangtasia...\" It all took longer than I thought, and by the time I had finished with the tale, Eric\u0027s hands were busy again. He latched onto one breast with his fangs extended, drawing a little blood and a sharp gasp from me, and he sucked powerfully. It was a strange sensation, because he was getting the blood and my nipple. Painful and very exciting - I felt like he was drawing the fluid from much lower. I gasped and jerked in arousal, and suddenly he raised my leg so he could enter me. It wasn\u0027t such a shock this time, and it was slower. Eric wanted me to be looking into his eyes; that obviously flicked his Bic. I was exhausted when it was over, though I\u0027d enjoyed myself immensely. I\u0027d heard a lot about men who didn\u0027t care if the woman had her pleasure, or perhaps such men assumed that if they were happy, their partner was, too. But neither of the men I\u0027d been with had been like that. I didn\u0027t know if that was because they were vampires, or because I\u0027d been lucky, or both. Eric had paid me many compliments, and I realized I hadn\u0027t said anything to him that indicated my admiration. That hardly seemed fair. He was holding me, and my head was on his shoulder. I murmured into his neck, \"You are so beautiful.\" \"What?\" He was clearly startled. \"You\u0027ve told me you thought my body was nice.\" Of course that wasn\u0027t the adjective he\u0027d used, but I was embarrassed to repeat his actual words. \"I just wanted you to know I think the same about you.\" I could feel his chest move as he laughed, just a little. \"What part do you like best?\" he asked, his voice teasing. \"Oh, your butt,\" I said instantly. \"My... bottom?\" \"Yep.\" \"I would have thought of another part.\" \"Well, that\u0027s certainly... adequate,\" I told him, burying my face in his chest. I knew immediately I\u0027d picked the wrong word. \"Adequate?\" He took my hand, placed it on the part in question. It immediately began to stir. He moved my hand on it, and I obligingly circled it with my fingers. \"This is adequate?\" \"Maybe I should have said it\u0027s a gracious plenty?\" \"A gracious plenty. I like that,\" he said. He was ready again, and honestly, I didn\u0027t know if I could. I was worn out to the point of wondering if I\u0027d be walking funny the next day. I indicated I would be pleased with an alternative by sliding down in the bed, and he seemed delighted to reciprocate. After another sublime release, I thought every muscle in my body had turned to Jell-O. I didn\u0027t talk anymore about the worry I felt about my brother, about the terrible things that had happened in Shreveport, about anything unpleasant. We whispered some heartfelt (on my part) mutual compliments, and I was just out of it. I don\u0027t know what Eric did for the rest of the night, because I fell asleep. I had many worries waiting for me the next day; but thanks to Eric, for a few precious hours I just didn\u0027t care.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-to-the-world-sookie-stackhouse-4/page-7.html","bookId":2194,"book":{"id":2194,"title":"Dead to the World (Sookie Stackhouse #4)","description":"Storyline: Dead to the World (Sookie Stackhouse #4) Sookie Stackhouse is a cocktail waitress in Bon Temps, Louisiana.
