{"id":100773,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"14\n I guess Pam worked on Hallow right up until dawn was peeking over the horizon. I myself was so heavily asleep, so in need of both physical and mental healing, I didn\u0027t wake until four in the afternoon. It was a gloomy winter day, the kind that makes you switch on the radio to see if an ice storm is coming. I checked to make sure I had three or four days\u0027 worth of firewood moved up onto the back porch.\n Eric would be up early today.\n I dressed and ate at the speed of a snail, trying to get a handle on my state of being.\n Physically, I was fine. A bruise here or there, a little muscle soreness - that was nothing. It was the second week of January and I was sticking to my New Year\u0027s resolution just great.\n On the other hand - and there\u0027s always another hand - mentally, or maybe emotionally, I was less than rock-steady. No matter how practical you are, no matter how strong-stomached you are, you can\u0027t do something like I\u0027d done without suffering some consequences.\n That\u0027s the way it should be.\n When I thought of Eric getting up, I thought of maybe doing some snuggling before I had to go to work. And I thought of the pleasure of being with someone who thought I was so important.\n I hadn\u0027t anticipated that the spell would have been broken.\n Eric got up at five-thirty. When I heard movement in the guest bedroom, I tapped on the door and opened it. He whirled, his fangs running out and his hands clawing in front of him.\n I\u0027d almost said, \"Hi, honey,\" but caution kept me mute.\n \"Sookie,\" he said slowly. \"Am I in your house?\"\n I was glad I\u0027d gotten dressed. \"Yes,\" I said, regrouping like crazy. \"You\u0027ve been here for safekeeping. Do you know what happened?\"\n \"I went to a meeting with some new people,\" he said, doubt in his voice. \"Didn\u0027t I?\" He looked down at his WalMart clothes with some surprise. \"When did I buy these?\"\n \"I had to get those for you,\" I said.\n \"Did you dress me, too?\" he asked, running his hands down his chest and lower. He gave me a very Eric smile.\n He didn\u0027t remember. Anything.\n \"No,\" I said. I flashed on Eric in the shower with me. The kitchen table. The bed.\n \"Where is Pam?\" he asked.\n \"You should call her,\" I said. \"Do you recall anything about yesterday?\"\n \"Yesterday I had the meeting with the witches,\" he said, as if that was indisputable.\n I shook my head. \"That was days ago,\" I told him, unable to add the number of them up in my head. My heart sank even lower.\n \"You don\u0027t remember last night, after we came back from Shreveport,\" I pressed him, suddenly seeing a gleam of light in all this.\n \"Did we make love?\" he asked hopefully. \"Did you finally yield to me, Sookie? It\u0027s only a matter of time, of course.\" He grinned at me.\n No, last night we cleaned up a body, I thought.\n I was the only one who knew. And even I didn\u0027t know where Debbie\u0027s remains were buried, or what had happened to her car.\n I sat down on the edge of my old narrow bed. Eric looked at me closely. \"Something\u0027s wrong, Sookie? What happened while I was - Why don\u0027t I remember what happened?\"\n Least said, soonest mended.\n All\u0027s well that ends well.\n Out of sight, out of mind. (Oh, I wished that were true.)\n \"I bet Pam will be here any minute,\" I said. \"I think I\u0027ll let her tell you all about it.\"\n \"And Chow?\"\n \"No, he won\u0027t be here. He died last night. Fangtasia seems to have a bad effect on bartenders.\"\n \"Who killed him? I\u0027ll have vengeance.\"\n \"You\u0027ve already had.\"\n \"Something more is wrong with you,\" Eric said. He\u0027d always been astute.\n \"Yes, lots of stuff is wrong with me.\" I would\u0027ve enjoyed hugging him right then, but it would just complicate everything. \"And I think it\u0027s going to snow.\"\n \"Snow, here?\" Eric was as delighted as a child. \"I love snow!\"\n Why was I not surprised?\n \"Maybe we will get snowed in together,\" he said suggestively, waggling his blond eyebrows.\n I laughed. I just couldn\u0027t help it. And it was a hell of a lot better than crying, which I\u0027d done quite enough of lately. \"As if you\u0027d ever let the weather stop you from doing what you wanted to do,\" I said, and stood. \"Come on, I\u0027ll heat you up some blood.\"\n Even a few nights of intimacy had softened me enough that I had to watch my actions. Once I almost stroked his hair as I passed him; and once I bent to give him a kiss, and had to pretend I\u0027d dropped something on the floor.\n When Pam knocked on my front door thirty minutes later, I was ready for work, and Eric was antsy as hell.\n Pam was no sooner seated opposite him than he began bombarding her with questions. I told them quietly that I was leaving, and I don\u0027t think they even noticed when I went out the kitchen door.\n Merlotte\u0027s wasn\u0027t too busy that night, after we dealt with a rather large supper crowd. A few flakes of snow had convinced most of the regulars that going home sober might be a very good idea. There were enough customers left to keep Arlene and me moderately busy. Sam caught me as I was loading my tray with seven mugs of beer and wanted to be filled in on the night before.\n \"I\u0027ll tell you later,\" I promised, thinking I\u0027d have to edit my narrative pretty carefully.\n \"Any trace of Jason?\" he asked.\n \"No,\" I said, and felt sadder than ever. The dispatcher at the law enforcement complex had sounded almost snappish when I\u0027d called to ask if there was any news.\n Kevin and Kenya came in that night after they\u0027d gotten off duty. When I took their drinks to the table (a bourbon and Coke and a gin and tonic), Kenya said, \"We\u0027ve been looking for your brother, Sookie. I\u0027m sorry.\"\n \"I know you all have been trying,\" I said. \"I appreciate you all organizing the search party so much! I just wish...\" And then I couldn\u0027t think of anything else to say. Thanks to my disability, I knew something about each of them that the other didn\u0027t know. They loved each other. But Kevin knew his mother would stick her head in the oven before she\u0027d see him married to a black woman, and Kenya knew her brothers would rather ram Kevin through a wall than see him walk down the aisle with her.\n And I knew this, despite the fact that neither of them did; and I hated having this personal knowledge, this intimate knowledge, that I just couldn\u0027t help knowing.\n Worse than knowing, even, was the temptation to interfere. I told myself very sternly that I had enough problems of my own without causing problems for other people. Luckily, I was busy enough the rest of the night to erase the temptation from my mind. Though I couldn\u0027t reveal those kinds of secrets, I reminded myself that I owed the two officers, big-time. If I heard of something I could let them know, I would.\n When the bar closed, I helped Sam put the chairs up on the tables so Terry Bellefleur could come in and mop and clean the toilets early in the morning. Arlene and Tack had left, singing \"Let It Snow\" while they went out the back door. Sure enough, the flakes were drifting down outside, though I didn\u0027t think they\u0027d stick past morning. I thought of the creatures out in the woods tonight, trying to keep warm and dry. I knew that in some spot in the forest, Debbie Pelt lay in a hole, cold forever.\n I wondered how long I\u0027d think of her like that, and I hoped very much I could remember just as clearly what an awful person she\u0027d been, how vindictive and murderous.\n In fact, I\u0027d stood staring out the window for a couple of minutes when Sam came up behind me.\n \"What\u0027s on your mind?\" he asked. He gripped my elbow, and I could feel the strength in his fingers.\n I sighed, not for the first time. \"Just wondering about Jason,\" I said. That was close enough to the truth.\n He patted me in a consoling way. \"Tell me about last night,\" he said, and for one second I thought he was asking me about Debbie. Then, of course, I knew he referred to the battle with the witches, and I was able to give him an account.\n \"So Pam showed up tonight at your place.\" Sam sounded pleased about that. \"She must have cracked Hallow, made her undo the spell. Eric was himself again?\"\n \"As far as I could tell.\"\n \"What did he have to say about the experience?\"\n \"He didn\u0027t remember anything about it,\" I said slowly. \"He didn\u0027t seem to have a clue.\"\n Sam looked away from me when he said, \"How are you, with that?\"\n \"I think it\u0027s for the best,\" I told him. \"Definitely.\" But I would be going home to an empty house again. The knowledge skittered at the edges of my awareness, but I wouldn\u0027t look at it directly.\n \"Too bad you weren\u0027t working the afternoon shift,\" he said, somehow following a similar train of thought. \"Calvin Norris was in here.\"\n \"And?\"\n \"I think he came in hopes of seeing you.\"\n I looked at Sam skeptically. \"Right.\"\n \"I think he\u0027s serious, Sookie.\"\n \"Sam,\" I said, feeling unaccountably wounded, \"I\u0027m on my own, and sometimes that\u0027s no fun, but I don\u0027t have to take up with a werewolf just because he offers.\"\n Sam looked mildly puzzled. \"You wouldn\u0027t have to. The people in Hotshot aren\u0027t Weres.\"\n \"He said they were.\"\n \"No, not Weres with a capital W. They\u0027re too proud to call themselves shifters, but that\u0027s what they are. They\u0027re were-panthers.\"\n \"What?\" I swear I saw dots floating in the air around my eyes.\n \"Sookie? What\u0027s wrong?\"\n \"Panthers? Didn\u0027t you know that the print on Jason\u0027s dock was the print of a panther?\"\n \"No, no one told me about any print! Are you sure?\"\n I gave him an exasperated look. \"Of course, I\u0027m sure. And he vanished the night Crystal Norris was waiting for him in his house. You\u0027re the only bartender in the world who doesn\u0027t know all the town gossip.\"\n \"Crystal - she\u0027s the Hotshot girl he was with New Year\u0027s Eve? The skinny black-headed girl at the search?\"\n I nodded.\n \"The one Felton loves so much?\"\n \"He what?\"\n \"Felton, you know, the one who came along on the search. She\u0027s been his big love his whole life.\"\n \"And you know this how?\" Since I, the mind reader, didn\u0027t, I was distinctly piqued.\n \"He told me one night when he\u0027d had too much to drink. These guys from Hotshot, they don\u0027t come in much, but when they do, they drink serious.\"\n \"So why would he join in the search?\"\n \"I think maybe we\u0027d better go ask a few questions.\"\n \"This late?\"\n \"You got something better to do?\"\n He had a point, and I sure wanted to know if they had my brother or could tell me what had happened to him. But in a way, I was scared of finding out.\n \"That jacket\u0027s too light for this weather, Sookie,\" Sam said, as we bundled up.\n \"My coat is at the cleaner\u0027s,\" I said. Actually, I hadn\u0027t had a chance to put it in the dryer, or even to check to make sure all the blood had come out. And it had holes in it.\n \"Hmmm\" was all Sam said, before he loaned me a green pullover sweater to wear under my jacket. We got in Sam\u0027s pickup because the snow was really coming down, and like all men, Sam was convinced he could drive in the snow, though he\u0027d almost never done so.\n The drive out to Hotshot seemed even longer in the dark night, with the snow swirling down in the headlights.\n \"I thank you for taking me out here, but I\u0027m beginning to think we\u0027re crazy,\" I said, when we were halfway there.\n \"Is your seat belt on?\" Sam asked.\n \"Sure.\"\n \"Good,\" he said, and we kept on our way.\n Finally we reached the little community. There weren\u0027t any streetlights out here, of course, but a couple of the residents had paid to have security lights put up on the electric poles. Windows were glowing in some of the houses.\n \"Where do you think we should go?\"\n \"Calvin\u0027s. He\u0027s the one with the power,\" Sam said, sounding certain.\n I remembered how proud Calvin had been of his house, and I was a little curious to see the inside. His lights were on, and his pickup was parked in front of the house. Stepping out of the warm truck into the snowy night was like walking through a chilly wet curtain to reach the front door. I knocked, and after a long pause, the door came open. Calvin looked pleased until he saw Sam behind me.\n \"Come in,\" he said, not too warmly, and stood aside. We stamped our feet politely before we entered.\n The house was plain and clean, decorated with inexpensive but carefully arranged furniture and pictures. None of the pictures had people in them, which I thought interesting. Landscapes. Wildlife.\n \"This is a bad night to be out driving around,\" Calvin observed.\n I knew I\u0027d have to tread carefully, as much as I wanted to grab the front of his flannel shirt and scream in his face. This man was a ruler. The size of the kingdom didn\u0027t really matter.\n \"Calvin,\" I said, as calmly as I could, \"did you know that the police found a panther print on the dock, by Jason\u0027s bootprint?\"\n \"No,\" he said, after a long moment. I could see the anger building behind his eyes. \"We don\u0027t hear a lot of town gossip out here. I wondered why the search party had men with guns, but we make other people kind of nervous, and no one was talking to us much. Panther print. Huh.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t know that was your, um, other identity, until tonight.\"\n He looked at me steadily. \"You think that one of us made off with your brother.\"\n I stood silent, not shifting my eyes from his. Sam was equally still beside me.\n \"You think Crystal got mad at your brother and did him harm?\"\n \"No,\" I said. His golden eyes were getting wider and rounder as I spoke to him.\n \"Are you afraid of me?\" he asked suddenly.\n \"No,\" I said. \"I\u0027m not.\"\n \"Felton,\" he said.\n I nodded.\n \"Let\u0027s go see,\" he said.\n Back out into the snow and darkness. I could feel the sting of the flakes on my cheeks, and I was glad my jacket had a hood. Sam\u0027s gloved hand took mine as I stumbled over some discarded tool or toy in the yard of the house next to Felton\u0027s. As we trailed up to the concrete slab that formed Felton\u0027s front porch, Calvin was already knocking at the door.\n \"Who is it?\" Felton demanded.\n \"Open,\" said Calvin.\n Recognizing his voice, Felton opened the door immediately. He didn\u0027t have the same cleanliness bug as Calvin, and his furniture was not so much arranged as shoved up against whatever wall was handiest. The way he moved was not human, and tonight that seemed even more pronounced than it had at the search. Felton, I thought, was closer to reverting to his animal nature. Inbreeding had definitely left its mark on him.\n \"Where is the man?\" Calvin asked without preamble.\n Felton\u0027s eyes flared wide, and he twitched, as if he was thinking about running. He didn\u0027t speak.\n \"Where?\" Calvin demanded again, and then his hand changed into a paw and he swiped it across Felton\u0027s face. \"Does he live?\"\n I clapped my hands across my mouth so I wouldn\u0027t scream. Felton sank to his knees, his face crossed with parallel slashes filling with blood.\n \"In the shed in back,\" he said indistinctly.\n I went back out the front door so quickly that Sam barely caught up with me. Around the corner of the house I flew, and I fell full-length over a woodpile. Though I knew it would hurt later, I jumped up and found myself supported by Calvin Norris, who, as he had in the woods, lifted me over the pile before I knew what he intended. He vaulted it himself with easy grace, and then we were at the door of the shed, which was one of those you order from Sears or Penney\u0027s. You have your neighbors come help put it up, when the concrete truck comes to pour your slab.\n The door was padlocked, but these sheds aren\u0027t meant to repel determined intruders, and Calvin was very strong. He broke the lock, and pushed back the door, and turned on the light. It was amazing to me that there was electricity out here, because that\u0027s certainly not the norm.\n At first I wasn\u0027t sure I was looking at my brother, because this creature looked nothing like Jason. He was blond, sure, but he was so filthy and smelly that I flinched, even in the freezing air. And he was blue with the cold, since he had only pants on. He was lying on a single blanket on the concrete floor.\n I was on my knees beside him, gathering him up as best I could in my arms, and his eyelids fluttered open. \"Sookie?\" he said, and I could hear the disbelief in his voice. \"Sookie? Am I saved?\"\n \"Yes,\" I said, though I was by no means so sure. I remember what had happened to the sheriff who\u0027d come out here and found something amiss. \"We\u0027re going to take you home.\"\n He\u0027d been bitten.\n He\u0027d been bitten a lot.\n \"Oh, no,\" I said softly, the significance of the bites sinking in.\n \"I didn\u0027t kill him,\" Felton said defensively, from outside.\n \"You bit him,\" I said, and my voice sounded like another person\u0027s. \"You wanted him to be like you.\"\n \"So Crystal wouldn\u0027t like him better. She knows we need to breed outside, but she really likes me best,\" Felton said.\n \"So you grabbed him, and you kept him, and you bit him.\"\n Jason was too weak to stand.\n \"Please carry him to the truck,\" I said stiffly, unable to meet the eyes of anyone around me. I could feel the fury rising in me like black wave, and I knew I had to restrain it until we were out of here. I had just enough control to do this. I knew I did.\n Jason cried out when Calvin and Sam lifted him. They got the blanket, too, and sort of tucked it around him. I stumbled after them as they made their way back to Calvin\u0027s and the truck.\n I had my brother back. There was a chance he was going to turn into a panther from time to time, but I had him back. I didn\u0027t know if the rules for all shifters were the same, but Alcide had told me that Weres who were bitten, not born - created Weres, rather than genetic Weres - changed into the half-man, half-beast creatures who populated horror movies. I forced myself to get off that track, to think of the joy of having my brother back, alive.\n Calvin got Jason into the truck and slid him over, and Sam climbed into the driver\u0027s seat. Jason would be between us after I climbed into the truck. But Calvin had to tell me something first.\n \"Felton will be punished,\" he said. \"Right now.\"\n Punishing Felton hadn\u0027t been at the top of my list of things to think about, but I nodded, because I wanted to get the hell out of there.\n \"If we\u0027re taking care of Felton, are you going to go to the police?\" he asked. He was standing stiffly, as if he was trying to be casual about the question. But this was a dangerous moment. I knew what happened to people who drew attention to the Hotshot community.\n \"No,\" I said. \"It was just Felton.\" Though, of course, Crystal had to have known, at least on some level. She\u0027d told me she\u0027d smelled an animal that night at Jason\u0027s. How could she have mistaken the smell of panther, when she was one? And she had probably known all along that that panther had been Felton. His smell would be familiar to her. But it just wasn\u0027t the time to go into that; Calvin would know that as well as I, when he\u0027d had a moment to think. \"And my brother may be one of you now. He\u0027ll need you,\" I added, in the most even voice I could manage. It wasn\u0027t very even, at that.\n \"I\u0027ll come get Jason, next full moon.\"\n I nodded again. \"Thank you,\" I told him, because I knew we would never have found Jason if he\u0027d stonewalled us. \"I have to get my brother home now.\" I knew Calvin wanted me to touch him, wanted me to connect with him somehow, but I just couldn\u0027t do it.\n \"Sure,\" he said, after a long moment. The shape-shifter stepped back while I scrambled up into the cab. He seemed to know I wouldn\u0027t want any help from him right now.\n I\u0027d thought I\u0027d gotten unusual brain patterns from the Hotshot people because they were inbred. It had never occurred to me they were something other than wolves. I\u0027d assumed. I know what my high school volleyball coach always said about \"assume.\" Of course, he\u0027d also told us that we had to leave everything out on the court so it would be there when we came back, which I had yet to figure out.\n But he\u0027d been right about assumptions.\n Sam had already gotten the heater in the truck going, but not at full blast. Too much heat too soon would be bad for Jason, I was sure. As it was, the second Jason began to warm up, his smell was pretty evident, and I nearly apologized to Sam, but sparing Jason any further humiliation was more important.\n \"Aside from the bites, and being so cold, are you okay?\" I asked, when I thought Jason had stopped shivering and could speak.\n \"Yes,\" he said. \"Yes. Every night, every damn night, he\u0027d come in the shed, and he\u0027d change in front of me, and I\u0027d think, Tonight he\u0027s going to kill me and eat me. And every night, he\u0027d bite me. And then he\u0027d just change back and leave. I could tell it was hard for him, after he\u0027d smelled the blood... but he never did more than bite.\"\n \"They\u0027ll kill him tonight,\" I said. \"In return for us not going to the police.\"\n \"Good deal,\" said Jason, and he meant it. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-to-the-world-sookie-stackhouse-4/page-15.html","bookId":2194,"book":{"id":2194,"title":"Dead to the World (Sookie Stackhouse #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Dead to the World (Sookie Stackhouse #4) \n Sookie Stackhouse is a cocktail waitress in Bon Temps, Louisiana.
