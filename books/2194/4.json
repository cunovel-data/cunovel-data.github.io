{"id":100762,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"3\n \"How did this happen?\" I asked the fire, when they were all gone.\n All except for the big Viking vampire I was supposed to preserve and protect.\n I was sitting on the rug in front of the fire. I\u0027d just thrown in another piece of wood, and the flames were really lovely. I needed to think about something pleasant and comforting.\n I saw a big bare foot out of the corner of my eye. Eric sank down to join me on the hearth rug. \"I think this happened because you have a greedy brother, and because you are the kind of woman who would stop for me even though she was afraid,\" Eric said accurately.\n \"How are you feeling about all this?\" I never would have asked the compos mentis Eric this question, but he still seemed so different; maybe not the completely terrified mess he\u0027d been the night before, but still very un-Eric. \"I mean - it\u0027s like you\u0027re a package that they put in a storage locker, me being the locker.\"\n \"I am glad they are afraid enough of me to take good care of me.\"\n \"Huh,\" I said intelligently. Not the answer I\u0027d expected.\n \"I must be a frightening person, when I am myself. Or do I inspire so much loyalty through my good works and kind ways?\"\n I sniggered.\n \"I thought not.\"\n \"You\u0027re okay,\" I said reassuringly, though come to think of it, Eric didn\u0027t look like he needed much reassurance. However, now I was responsible for him. \"Aren\u0027t your feet cold?\"\n \"No,\" he said. But now I was in the business of taking care of Eric, who so didn\u0027t need taking care of. And I was being paid a staggering amount of money to do just that, I reminded myself sternly. I got the old quilt from the back of the couch and covered his legs and feet in green, blue, and yellow squares. I collapsed back onto the rug beside him.\n \"That\u0027s truly hideous,\" Eric said.\n \"That\u0027s what Bill said.\" I rolled over on my stomach and caught myself smiling.\n \"Where is this Bill?\"\n \"He\u0027s in Peru.\"\n \"Did he tell you he was going?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Am I to assume that your relationship with him has waned?\"\n That was a pretty nice way to put it. \"We\u0027ve been on the outs. It\u0027s beginning to look permanent,\" I said, my voice even.\n He was on his stomach beside me now, propped up on his elbows so we could talk. He was a little closer than I was comfortable with, but I didn\u0027t want to make a big issue out of scooting over. He half turned to toss the quilt over both of us.\n \"Tell me about him,\" Eric said unexpectedly. He and Pam and Chow had all had a glass of TrueBlood before the other vampires left, and he was looking pinker.\n \"You know Bill,\" I told him. \"He\u0027s worked for you for quite a while. I guess you can\u0027t remember, but Bill\u0027s - well, he\u0027s kind of cool and calm, and he\u0027s really protective, and he can\u0027t seem to get some things through his head.\" I never thought I\u0027d be rehashing my relationship with Bill with Eric, of all people.\n \"He loves you?\"\n I sighed, and my eyes watered, as they so often did when I thought of Bill - Weeping Willa, that was me. \"Well, he said he did,\" I muttered dismally. \"But then when this vampire ho contacted him somehow, he went a-running.\" For all I knew, she\u0027d emailed him. \"He\u0027d had an affair with her before, and she turned out to be his, I don\u0027t know what you call \u0027em, the one who turned him into a vampire. Brought him over, he said. So Bill took back up with her. He says he had to. And then he found out\" - I looked sideways at Eric with a significant raise of the eyebrows, and Eric looked fascinated - \"that she was just trying to lure him over to the even-darker side.\"\n \"Pardon?\"\n \"She was trying to get him to come over to another vampire group in Mississippi and bring with him the really valuable computer database he\u0027d put together for your people, the Louisiana vamps,\" I said, simplifying a little bit for the sake of brevity.\n \"What happened?\"\n This was as much fun as talking to Arlene. Maybe even more, because I\u0027d never been able to tell her the whole story. \"Well, Lorena, that\u0027s her name, she tortured him,\" I said, and Eric\u0027s eyes widened. \"Can you believe that? She could torture someone she\u0027d made love with? Someone she\u0027d lived with for years?\" Eric shook his head disbelievingly. \"Anyway, you told me to go to Jackson and find him, and I sort of picked up clues at this nightclub for Supes only.\" Eric nodded. Evidently, I didn\u0027t have to explain that Supes meant supernatural beings. \"Its real name is Josephine\u0027s, but the Weres call it Club Dead. You told me to go there with this really nice Were who owed you a big favor, and I stayed at his place.\" Alcide Herveaux still figured in my daydreams. \"But I ended up getting hurt pretty bad,\" I concluded. Hurt pretty bad, as always.\n \"How?\"\n \"I got staked, believe it or not.\"\n Eric looked properly impressed. \"Is there a scar?\"\n \"Yeah, even though - \" And here I stopped dead.\n He gave every indication he was hanging on my words. \"What?\"\n \"You got one of the Jackson vampires to work on the wound, so I\u0027d survive for sure... and then you gave me blood to heal me quick, so I could look for Bill at daylight.\" Remembering how Eric had given me blood made my cheeks turn red, and I could only hope Eric would attribute my flush to the heat of the fire.\n \"And you saved Bill?\" he said, moving beyond that touchy part.\n \"Yes, I did,\" I said proudly. \"I saved his ass.\" I rolled onto my back and looked up at him. Gee, it was nice to have someone to talk to. I pulled up my T-shirt and inclined partially on my side to show Eric the scar, and he looked impressed. He touched the shiny area with a fingertip and shook his head. I rearranged myself.\n \"And what happened to the vampire ho?\" he asked\n I eyed him suspiciously, but he didn\u0027t seem to be making fun of me. \"Well,\" I said, \"um, actually, I kind of... She came in while I was getting Bill untied, and she attacked me, and I kind of... killed her.\"\n Eric looked at me intently. I couldn\u0027t read his expression. \"Had you ever killed anyone before?\" he asked.\n \"Of course not!\" I said indignantly. \"Well, I did hurt a guy who was trying to kill me, but he didn\u0027t die. No, I\u0027m a human. I don\u0027t have to kill anyone to live.\"\n \"But humans kill other humans all the time. And they don\u0027t even need to eat them or drink their blood.\"\n \"Not all humans.\"\n \"True enough,\" he said. \"We vampires are all murderers.\"\n \"But in a way, you\u0027re like lions.\"\n Eric looked astonished. \"Lions?\" he said weakly.\n \"Lions all kill stuff.\" At the moment, this idea seemed like an inspiration. \"So you\u0027re predators, like lions and raptors. But you use what you kill. You have to kill to eat.\"\n \"The catch in that comforting theory being that we look almost exactly like you. And we used to be you. And we can love you, as well as feed off you. You could hardly say the lion wanted to caress the antelope.\"\n Suddenly there was something in the air that hadn\u0027t been there the moment before. I felt a little like an antelope that was being stalked - by a lion that was a deviant.\n I\u0027d felt more comfortable when I was taking care of a terrified victim.\n \"Eric,\" I said, very cautiously, \"you know you\u0027re my guest here. And you know if I tell you to leave, which I will if you\u0027re not straight with me, you\u0027ll be standing out in the middle of a field somewhere in a bathrobe that\u0027s too short for you.\"\n \"Have I said something to make you uncomfortable?\" He was (apparently) completely contrite, blue eyes blazing with sincerity. \"I\u0027m sorry. I was just trying to continue your train of thought. Do you have some more TrueBlood? What clothes did Jason get for me? Your brother is a very clever man.\" He didn\u0027t sound a hundred percent admiring when he told me this. I didn\u0027t blame him. Jason\u0027s cleverness might cost him thirty-five thousand dollars. I got up to fetch the WalMart bag, hoping that Eric liked his new Louisiana Tech sweatshirt and cheap jeans.\n I turned in about midnight, leaving Eric absorbed in my tapes of the first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. (Though welcome, these were actually a gag gift from Tara.) Eric thought the show was a hoot, especially the way the vampires\u0027 foreheads bulged out when they got blood-lusty. From time to time, I could hear Eric laughing all the way back in my room. But the sound didn\u0027t bother me. I found it reassuring to hear someone else in the house.\n It took me a little longer than usual to fall asleep, because I was thinking over the things that had happened that day. Eric was in the witness protection program, in a way, and I was providing the safe house. No one in the world - well, except for Jason, Pam, and Chow - knew where the sheriff of Area Five actually was at this moment.\n Which was, sliding into my bed.\n I didn\u0027t want to open my eyes and quarrel with him. I was just at that cusp between waking and dreaming. When he\u0027d climbed in the night before, Eric had been so afraid that I\u0027d felt quite maternal, comfortable in holding his hand to reassure him. Tonight it didn\u0027t seem so, well, neutral, having him in the bed with me.\n \"Cold?\" I murmured, as he huddled close.\n \"Um-hum,\" he whispered. I was on my back, so comfortable I could not contemplate moving. He was on his side facing me, and he put an arm across my waist. But he didn\u0027t move another inch, and he relaxed completely. After a moment\u0027s tension, I did, too, and then I was dead to the world.\n The next thing I knew, it was morning and the phone was ringing. Of course, I was by myself in bed, and through my open doorway I could see across the hall into the smaller bedroom. The closet door was open, as he\u0027d had to leave it when dawn came and he\u0027d lowered himself into the light-tight hole.\n It was bright and warmer today, up in the forties and heading for the fifties. I felt much more cheerful than I\u0027d felt upon waking the day before. I knew what was happening now; or at least I knew more or less what I was supposed to do, how the next few days would go. Or I thought I did. When I answered the phone, I discovered that I was way off.\n \"Where\u0027s your brother?\" yelled Jason\u0027s boss, Shirley Hennessey. You thought a man named Shirley was funny only until you were face-to-face with the real deal, at which point you decided it would really be better to keep your amusement to yourself.\n \"How would I know?\" I said reasonably. \"Probably slept over at some woman\u0027s place.\" Shirley, who was universally known as Catfish, had never, ever called here before to track Jason down. In fact, I\u0027d be surprised if he\u0027d ever had to call anywhere. One thing Jason was good about was showing up at work on time and at least going through the motions until that time was up. In fact, Jason was pretty good at his job, which I\u0027d never fully understood. It seemed to involve parking his fancy truck at the parish road department, getting into another truck with the Renard parish logo on the door, and driving around telling various road crews what to do. It also seemed to demand that he get out of the truck to stand with other men as they all stared into big holes in or near the road.\n Catfish was knocked off balance by my frankness. \"Sookie, you shouldn\u0027t say that kind of thing,\" he said, quite shocked at a single woman admitting she knew her brother wasn\u0027t a virgin.\n \"Are you telling me that Jason hasn\u0027t shown up at work? And you\u0027ve called his house?\"\n \"Yes and yes,\" said Catfish, who in most respects was no fool. \"I even sent Dago out to his place.\" Dago (road crew members had to have nicknames) was Antonio Guglielmi, who had never been farther from Louisiana than Mississippi. I was pretty sure the same could be said for his parents, and possibly his grandparents, though there was rumor they\u0027d once been to Branson to take in the shows.\n \"Was his truck out there?\" I was beginning to have that cold creeping feeling.\n \"Yes,\" Catfish said. \"It was parked in front of his house, keys inside. Door hanging open.\"\n \"The truck door or the house door?\"\n \"What?\"\n \"Hanging open. Which door?\"\n \"Oh, the truck.\"\n \"This is bad, Catfish,\" I said. I was tingling all over with alarm.\n \"When you seen him last?\"\n \"Just last night. He was over here visiting with me, and he left about... oh, let\u0027s see... it must have been nine-thirty or ten.\"\n \"He have anybody with him?\"\n \"No.\" He hadn\u0027t brought anybody with him, so that was pretty much the truth.\n \"You think I oughta call the sheriff?\" Catfish asked.\n I ran a hand over my face. I wasn\u0027t ready for that yet, no matter how off the situation seemed. \"Let\u0027s give it another hour,\" I suggested. \"If he hasn\u0027t dragged into work in an hour, you let me know. If he does come in, you make him call me. I guess it\u0027s me ought to tell the sheriff, if it comes to that.\"\n I hung up after Catfish had repeated everything he\u0027d said several times, just because he hated to hang up and go back to worrying. No, I can\u0027t read minds over the telephone line, but I could read it in his voice. I\u0027ve known Catfish Hennessey for many years. He was a buddy of my father\u0027s.\n I carried the cordless phone into the bathroom with me while I took a shower to wake up. I didn\u0027t wash my hair, just in case I had to go outside right away. I got dressed, made some coffee, and braided my hair in one long braid. All the time while I performed these tasks, I was thinking, which is something that\u0027s hard for me to do when I\u0027m sitting still.\n I came up with these scenarios.\n One. (This was my favorite.) Somewhere between my house and his house, my brother had met up with a woman and fallen in love so instantly and completely that he had abandoned his habit of years and forgotten all about work. At this moment, they were in a bed somewhere, having great sex.\n Two. The witches, or whatever the hell they were, had somehow found out that Jason knew where Eric was, and they\u0027d abducted him to force the information from him. (I made a mental note to learn more about witches.) How long could Jason keep the secret of Eric\u0027s location? My brother had lots of attitude, but he actually is a brave man - or maybe stubborn is a little more accurate. He wouldn\u0027t talk easily. Maybe a witch could spell him into talking? If the witches had him, he might be dead already, since they\u0027d had him for hours. And if he\u0027d talked, I was in danger and Eric was doomed. They could be coming at any minute, since witches are not bound by darkness. Eric was dead for the day, defenseless. This was definitely the worst-case scenario.\n Three. Jason had returned to Shreveport with Pam and Chow. Maybe they\u0027d decided to pay him some up-front money, or maybe Jason just wanted to visit Fangtasia because it was a popular nightspot. Once there, he could have been seduced by some vamp girl and stayed up all night with her, since Jason was like Eric in that women really, really took a shine to him. If she\u0027d taken a little too much blood, Jason could be sleeping it off. I guess number three was really a variation on number one.\n If Pam and Chow knew where Jason was but hadn\u0027t phoned before they died for the day, I was real mad. My gut instinct was to go get the hatchet and start chopping some stakes.\n Then I remembered what I was trying so hard to forget: how it had felt when the stake pushed into Lorena\u0027s body, the expression on her face when she\u0027d realized her long, long life was over. I shoved that thought away as hard as I could. You didn\u0027t kill someone (even an evil vampire) without it affecting you sooner or later: at least not unless you were a complete sociopath, which I wasn\u0027t.\n Lorena would have killed me without blinking. In fact, she would have positively enjoyed it. But then, she was a vampire, and Bill never tired of telling me that vampires were different; that though they retained their human appearance (more or less), their internal functions and their personalities underwent a radical change. I believed him and took his warnings to heart, for the most part. It was just that they looked so human; it was so very easy to attribute normal human reactions and feelings to them.\n The frustrating thing was, Chow and Pam wouldn\u0027t be up until dark, and I didn\u0027t know who - or what - I\u0027d raise if I called Fangtasia during the day. I didn\u0027t think the two lived at the club. I\u0027d gotten the impression that Pam and Chow shared a house... or a mausoleum... somewhere in Shreveport.\n I was fairly sure that human employees came into the club during the day to clean, but of course a human wouldn\u0027t (couldn\u0027t) tell me anything about vampire affairs. Humans who worked for vampires learned pretty quick to keep their mouths shut, as I could attest.\n On the other hand, if I went to the club I\u0027d have a chance to talk to someone face-to-face. I\u0027d have a chance to read a human mind. I couldn\u0027t read vampire minds, which had led to my initial attraction to Bill. Imagine the relief of silence after a lifetime of elevator music. (Now, why couldn\u0027t I hear vampire thoughts? Here\u0027s my big theory about that. I\u0027m about as scientific as a Saltine, but I have read about neurons, which fire in your brain, right? When you\u0027re thinking? Since it\u0027s magic that animates vampires, not normal life force, their brains don\u0027t fire. So, nothing for me to pick up - except about once every three months, I\u0027d get a flash from a vampire. And I took great care to conceal that, because that was a sure way to court instant death.)\n Oddly enough, the only vampire I\u0027d ever \"heard\" twice was - you guessed it - Eric.\n I\u0027d been enjoying Eric\u0027s recent company so much for the same reason I\u0027d enjoyed Bill\u0027s, quite apart from the romantic component I\u0027d had with Bill. Even Arlene had a tendency to stop listening to me when I was talking, if she thought of something more interesting, like her children\u0027s grades or cute things they\u0027d said. But with Eric, he could be thinking about his car needing new windshield wipers while I was pouring my heart out, and I was none the wiser.\n The hour I\u0027d asked Catfish to give me was almost up, and all my constructive thought had dwindled into the same murky maundering I\u0027d gone through several times. Blah blah blah. This is what happens when you talk to yourself a lot.\n Okay, action time.\n The phone rang right at the hour, and Catfish admitted he had no news. No one had heard from Jason or seen him; but on the other hand, Dago hadn\u0027t seen anything suspicious at Jason\u0027s place except the truck\u0027s open door.\n I was still reluctant to call the sheriff, but I didn\u0027t see that I had much choice. At this point, it would seem peculiar to skip calling him.\n I expected a lot of hubbub and alarm, but what I got was even worse: I got benevolent indifference. Sheriff Bud Dearborn actually laughed.\n \"You callin\u0027 me because your tomcat of a brother is missing a day of work? Sookie Stackhouse, I\u0027m surprised at you.\" Bud Dearborn had a slow voice and the mashed-in face of a Pekinese, and it was all too easy to picture him snuffling into the phone.\n \"He never misses work, and his truck is at his house. The door was open,\" I said.\n He did grasp that significance, because Bud Dearborn is a man who knows how to appreciate a fine pickup.\n \"That does sound a little funny, but still, Jason is way over twenty-one and he has a reputation for...\" (Drilling anything that stands still, I thought.) \". . . being real popular with the ladies,\" Bud concluded carefully. \"I bet he\u0027s all shacked up with someone new, and he\u0027ll be real sorry to have caused you any worry. You call me back if you haven\u0027t heard from him by tomorrow afternoon, you hear?\"\n \"Right,\" I said in my most frozen voice.\n \"Now, Sookie, don\u0027t you go getting all mad at me, I\u0027m just telling you what any lawman would tell you,\" he said.\n I thought, Any lawman with lead in his butt. But I didn\u0027t say it out loud. Bud was what I had to work with, and I had to stay on his good side, as much as possible.\n I muttered something that was vaguely polite and got off the phone. After reporting back to Catfish, I decided my only course of action was to go to Shreveport. I started to call Arlene, but I remembered she\u0027d have the kids at home since it was still the school holiday. I thought of calling Sam, but I figured he might feel like he ought to do something, and I couldn\u0027t figure out what that would be. I just wanted to share my worries with someone. I knew that wasn\u0027t right. No one could help me, but me. Having made up my mind to be brave and independent, I almost phoned Alcide Herveaux, who is a well-to-do and hardworking guy based in Shreveport. Alcide\u0027s dad runs a surveying firm that contracts for jobs in three states, and Alcide travels a lot among the various offices. I\u0027d mentioned him the night before to Eric; Eric had sent Alcide to Jackson with me. But Alcide and I had some man-woman issues that were still unresolved, and it would be cheating to call him when I only wanted help he couldn\u0027t give. At least, that was how I felt.\n I was scared to leave the house in case there might be news of Jason, but since the sheriff wasn\u0027t looking for him, I hardly thought there would be any word soon.\n Before I left, I made sure I\u0027d arranged the closet in the smaller bedroom so that it looked natural. It would be a little harder for Eric to get out when the sun went down, but it wouldn\u0027t be extremely difficult. Leaving him a note would be a dead giveaway if someone broke in, and he was too smart to answer the phone if I called just after dark had fallen. But he was so discombobulated by his amnesia, he might be scared to wake all by himself with no explanation of my absence, I thought.\n I had a brainwave. Grabbing a little square piece of paper from last year\u0027s Word of the Day calendar (\"enthrallment\"), I wrote: Jason, if you should happen to drop by, call me! I am very worried about you. No one knows where you are. I\u0027ll be back this afternoon or evening. I\u0027m going to drop by your house, and then I\u0027ll check to see if you went to Shreveport. Then, back here. Love, Sookie. I got some tape and stuck the note to the refrigerator, just where a sister might expect her brother to head if he stopped by.\n There. Eric was plenty smart enough to read between the lines. And yet every word of it was feasible, so if anyone did break in to search the house, they\u0027d think I was taking a smart precaution.\n But still, I was frightened of leaving the sleeping Eric so vulnerable. What if the witches came looking?\n But why should they?\n If they could have tracked Eric, they\u0027d have been here by now, right? At least, that was the way I was reasoning. I thought of calling someone like Terry Bellefleur, who was plenty tough, to come sit in my house - I could use waiting on a call about Jason as my pretext - but it wasn\u0027t right to endanger anyone else in Eric\u0027s defense.\n I called all the hospitals in the area, feeling all the while that the sheriff should be doing this little job for me. The hospitals knew the name of everyone admitted, and none of them was Jason. I called the highway patrol to ask about accidents the night before and found there had been none in the vicinity. I called a few women Jason had dated, and I received a lot of negative responses, some of them obscene.\n I thought I\u0027d covered all the bases. I was ready to go to Jason\u0027s house, and I remember I was feeling pretty proud of myself as I drove north on Hummingbird Road and then took a left onto the highway. As I headed west to the house where I\u0027d spent my first seven years, I drove past Merlotte\u0027s to my right and then past the main turnoff into Bon Temps. I negotiated the left turn and I could see our old home, sure enough with Jason\u0027s pickup parked in front of it. There was another pickup, equally shiny, parked about twenty feet away from Jason\u0027s.\n When I got out of my car, a very black man was examining the ground around the truck. I was surprised to discover that the second pickup belonged to Alcee Beck, the only African-American detective on the parish force. Alcee\u0027s presence was both reassuring and disturbing.\n \"Miss Stackhouse,\" he said gravely. Alcee Beck was wearing a jacket and slacks and heavy scuffed boots. The boots didn\u0027t go with the rest of his clothes, and I was willing to bet he kept them in his truck for when he had to go tromping around out in the country where the ground was less than dry. Alcee (whose name was pronounced Al-SAY) was also a strong broadcaster, and I could receive his thoughts clearly when I let down my shields to listen.\n I learned in short order that Alcee Beck wasn\u0027t happy to see me, didn\u0027t like me, and did think something hinky had happened to Jason. Detective Beck didn\u0027t care for Jason, but he was actually scared of me. He thought I was a deeply creepy person, and he avoided me as much as possible.\n Which was okay by me, frankly.\n I knew more about Alcee Beck than I was comfortable knowing, and what I knew about Alcee was really unpleasant. He was brutal to uncooperative prisoners, though he adored his wife and daughter. He was lining his own pockets whenever he got a chance, and he made sure the chances came along pretty frequently. Alcee Beck confined this practice to the African-American community, operating on the theory that they\u0027d never report him to the other white law enforcement personnel, and so far he\u0027d been right.\n See what I mean about not wanting to know things I heard? This was a lot different from finding out that Arlene really didn\u0027t think Charlsie\u0027s husband was good enough for Charlsie, or that Hoyt Fortenberry had dented a car in the parking lot and hadn\u0027t told the owner.\n And before you ask me what I do about stuff like that, I\u0027ll tell you. I don\u0027t do squat. I\u0027ve found out the hard way that it almost never works out if I try to intervene. What happens is no one is happier, and my little freakishness is brought to everyone\u0027s attention, and no one is comfortable around me for a month. I\u0027ve got more secrets than Fort Knox has money. And those secrets are staying locked up just as tight.\n I\u0027ll admit that most of those little facts I accumulated didn\u0027t make much difference in the grand scheme of things, whereas Alcee\u0027s misbehavior actually led to human misery. But so far I hadn\u0027t seen a single way to stop Alcee. He was very clever about keeping his activities under control and hidden from anyone with the power to intervene. And I wasn\u0027t too awful sure that Bud Dearborn didn\u0027t know.\n \"Detective Beck,\" I said. \"Are you looking for Jason?\"\n \"The sheriff asked me to come by and see if I could find anything out of order.\"\n \"And have you found anything?\"\n \"No, ma\u0027am, I haven\u0027t.\"\n \"Jason\u0027s boss told you the door to his truck was open?\"\n \"I closed it so the battery wouldn\u0027t run down. I was careful not to touch anything, of course. But I\u0027m sure your brother will show back up any time now, and he\u0027ll be unhappy if we mess with his stuff for no reason.\"\n \"I have a key to his house, and I\u0027m going to ask you to go in there with me.\"\n \"Do you suspect anything happened to your brother in his house?\" Alcee Beck was being so careful to spell everything out that I wondered if he had a tape recorder rolling away in his pocket.\n \"Could be. He doesn\u0027t normally miss work. In fact, he never misses work. And I always know where he is. He\u0027s real good about letting me know.\"\n \"He\u0027d tell you if he was running off with a woman? Most brothers wouldn\u0027t do that, Miss Stackhouse.\"\n \"He\u0027d tell me, or he\u0027d tell Catfish.\"\n Alcee Beck did his best to keep his skeptical look on his dark face, but it didn\u0027t sit there easily.\n The house was still locked. I picked out the right key from the ones on my ring, and we went inside. I didn\u0027t have the feeling of homecoming when I entered, the feeling I used to have as a kid. I\u0027d lived in Gran\u0027s house so much longer than this little place. The minute Jason had turned twenty, he\u0027d moved over here full-time, and though I\u0027d dropped in, I\u0027d probably spent less than twenty-four hours total in this house in the last eight years.\n Glancing around me, I realized that my brother really hadn\u0027t changed the house much in all that time. It was a small ranch-style house with small rooms, but of course it was a lot younger than Gran\u0027s house - my house - and a lot more heating- and cooling-efficient. My father had done most of the work on it, and he was a good builder.\n The small living room was still filled with the maple furniture my mother had picked out at the discount furniture store, and its upholstery (cream with green and blue flowers that had never been seen in nature) was still bright, more\u0027s the pity. It had taken me a few years to realize that my mother, while a clever woman in some respects, had had no taste whatsoever. Jason had never come to that realization. He\u0027d replaced the curtains when they frayed and faded, and he\u0027d gotten a new rug to cover the most worn spots on the ancient blue carpet. The appliances were all new, and he\u0027d worked hard on updating the bathroom. But my parents, if they could have entered their home, would have felt quite comfortable.\n It was a shock to realize they\u0027d been dead for nearly twenty years.\n While I stood close to the doorway, praying I wouldn\u0027t see bloodstains, Alcee Beck prowled through the house, which certainly seemed orderly. After a second\u0027s indecision, I decided to follow him. There wasn\u0027t much to see; like I say, it\u0027s a small house. Three bedrooms (two of them quite cramped), the living room, a kitchen, one bathroom, a fair-sized family room, and a small dining room: a house that could be duplicated any number of times in any town in America.\n The house was quite tidy. Jason had never lived like a pig, though sometimes he acted like one. Even the king-size bed that almost filled the biggest bedroom was more-or-less pulled straight, though I could see the sheets were black and shiny. They were supposed to look like silk, but I was sure they were some artificial blend. Too slithery for me; I liked percale.\n \"No evidence of any struggle,\" the detective pointed out.\n \"While I\u0027m here, I\u0027m just going to get something,\" I told him, going over to the gun cabinet that had been my dad\u0027s. It was locked, so I checked my key ring again. Yes, I had a key for that, too, and I remembered some long story Jason had told me about why I needed one - in case he was out hunting and he needed another rifle, or something. As if I\u0027d drop everything and run to fetch another rifle for him!\n Well, I might, if I wasn\u0027t due at work, or something.\n All Jason\u0027s rifles, and my father\u0027s, were in the gun cabinet - all the requisite ammunition, too.\n \"All present?\" The detective was shifting around impatiently in the doorway to the dining room.\n \"Yes. I\u0027m just going to take one of them home with me.\"\n \"You expecting trouble at your place?\" Beck looked interested for the first time.\n \"If Jason is gone, who knows what it means?\" I said, hoping that was ambiguous enough. Beck had a very low opinion of my intelligence, anyway, despite the fact that he feared me. Jason had said he would bring me the shotgun, and I knew I would feel the better for having it. So I got out the Benelli and found its shells. Jason had very carefully taught me how to load and fire the shotgun, which was his pride and joy. There were two different boxes of shells.\n \"Which?\" I asked Detective Beck.\n \"Wow, a Benelli.\" He took time out to be impressed with gun. \"Twelve-gauge, huh? Me, I\u0027d take the turkey loads,\" he advised. \"Those target loads don\u0027t have as much stopping power.\"\n I popped the box he indicated into my pocket.\n I carried the shotgun out to my car, Beck trailing on my heels.\n \"You have to lock the shotgun in your trunk and the shells in the car,\" the detective informed me. I did exactly what he said, even putting the shells in the glove compartment, and then I turned to face him. He would be glad to be out of my sight, and I didn\u0027t think he would look for Jason with any enthusiasm.\n \"Did you check around back?\" I asked.\n \"I had just gotten here when you pulled up.\"\n I jerked my head in the direction of the pond behind the house, and we circled around to the rear. My brother, aided by Hoyt Fortenberry, had put in a large deck outside the back door maybe two years ago. He\u0027d arranged some nice outdoor furniture he\u0027d gotten on end-of-season sale at WalMart. Jason had even put an ashtray on the wrought-iron table for his friends who went outside to smoke. Someone had used it. Hoyt smoked, I recalled. There was nothing else interesting on the deck.\n The ground sloped down from the deck to the pond. While Alcee Beck checked the back door, I looked down to the pier my father had built, and I thought I could see a smear on the wood. Something in me crumpled at the sight, and I must have made a noise. Alcee came to stand by me, and I said, \"Look at the pier.\"\n He went on point, just like a setter. He said, \"Stay where you are,\" in an unmistakably official voice. He moved carefully, looking down at the ground around his feet before he took each step. I felt like an hour passed before Alcee finally reached the pier. He squatted down on the sun-bleached boards to take a close look. He focused a little to the right of the smear, evaluating something I couldn\u0027t see, something I couldn\u0027t even make out in his mind. But then he wondered what kind of work boots my brother wore; that came in clear.\n \"Caterpillars,\" I called. The fear built up in me till I felt I was vibrating with the intensity of it. Jason was all I had.\n And I realized I\u0027d made a mistake I hadn\u0027t done in years: I\u0027d answered a question before it had been asked out loud. I clapped a hand over my mouth and saw the whites of Beck\u0027s eyes. He wanted away from me. And he was thinking maybe Jason was in the pond, dead. He was speculating that Jason had fallen and knocked his head against the pier, and then slid into the water. But there was a puzzling print....\n \"When can you search the pond?\" I called.\n He turned to look at me, terror on his face. I hadn\u0027t had anyone look at me like that in years. I had him spooked, and I hadn\u0027t wanted to have that effect on him.\n \"The blood is on the dock,\" I pointed out, trying to improve matters. Providing a reasonable explanation was second nature. \"I\u0027m scared Jason went into the water.\"\n Beck seemed to settle down a little after that. He turned his eyes back to the water. My father had chosen the site for the house to include the pond. He\u0027d told me when I was little that the pond was very deep and fed by a tiny stream. The area around two-thirds of the pond was mowed and maintained as yard; but the farthest edge of it was left thickly wooded, and Jason enjoyed sitting on the deck in the late evening with binoculars, watching critters come to drink.\n There were fish in the pond. He kept it stocked. My stomach lurched.\n Finally, the detective walked up the slope to the deck. \"I have to call around, see who can dive,\" Alcee Beck said. \"It may take a while to find someone who can do it. And the chief has to okay it.\"\n Of course, such a thing would cost money, and that money might not be in the parish budget. I took a deep breath. \"Are you talking hours, or days?\"\n \"Maybe a day or two,\" he said at last. \"No way anyone can do it who isn\u0027t trained. It\u0027s too cold, and Jason himself told me it was deep.\"\n \"All right,\" I said, trying to suppress my impatience and anger. Anxiety gnawed at me like another kind of hunger.\n \"Carla Rodriguez was in town last night,\" Alcee Beck told me, and after a long moment, the significance of that sank into my brain.\n Carla Rodriguez, tiny and dark and electric, had been the closest shave Jason had ever had with losing his heart. In fact, the little shifter Jason had had a date with on New Year\u0027s Eve had somewhat resembled Carla, who had moved to Houston three years ago, much to my relief. I\u0027d been tired of the pyrotechnics surrounding her romance with my brother; their relationship had been punctuated by long and loud and public arguments, hung-up telephones, and slammed doors.\n \"Why? Who\u0027s she staying with?\"\n \"Her cousin in Shreveport,\" Beck said. \"You know, that Dovie.\"\n Dovie Rodriguez had visited Bon Temps a lot while Carla had lived here. Dovie had been the more sophisticated city cousin, down in the country to correct all our local yokel ways. Of course, we\u0027d envied Dovie.\n I thought that tackling Dovie was just what I wanted to do.\n It looked like I\u0027d be going to Shreveport after all. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-to-the-world-sookie-stackhouse-4/page-4.html","bookId":2194,"book":{"id":2194,"title":"Dead to the World (Sookie Stackhouse #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Dead to the World (Sookie Stackhouse #4) \n Sookie Stackhouse is a cocktail waitress in Bon Temps, Louisiana.
