{"id":100767,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"8\n \"Come on, lover, let\u0027s have a look,\" Eric said, giving me a quick kiss. He jumped off the back porch with me still attached to him - like a large barnacle - and he landed silently, which seemed amazing. I was the noisy one, with my breathing and little sounds of surprise. With a dexterity that argued long practice, Eric slung me around so that I was riding his back. I hadn\u0027t done this since I was a child and my father had carried me piggyback, so I was considerably startled.\n Oh, I was doing one great job of hiding Eric. Here we were, bounding through the cemetery, going toward the Wicked Witch of the West, instead of hiding in a dark hole where she couldn\u0027t find us. This was so smart.\n At the same time, I had to admit that I was kind of having fun, despite the difficulties of keeping a grip on Eric in this gently rolling country. The graveyard was somewhat downhill from my house. Bill\u0027s house, the Compton house, was quite a bit more uphill from Sweet Home Cemetery. The journey downhill, mild as the slope was, was exhilarating, though I glimpsed two or three parked cars on the narrow blacktop that wound through the graves. That startled me. Teenagers sometimes chose the cemetery for privacy, but not in groups. But before I could think it through, we had passed them, swiftly and silently. Eric managed the uphill portion more slowly, but with no evidence of exhaustion.\n We were next to a tree when Eric stopped. It was a huge oak, and when I touched it I became more or less oriented. There was an oak this size maybe twenty yards to the north of Bill\u0027s house.\n Eric loosened my hands so I\u0027d slide down his back, and then he put me between him and the tree trunk. I didn\u0027t know if he was trying to trap me or protect me. I gripped both his wrists in a fairly futile attempt to keep him beside me. I froze when I heard a voice drifting over from Bill\u0027s house.\n \"This car hasn\u0027t moved in a while,\" a woman said. Hallow. She was in Bill\u0027s carport, which was on this side of the house. She was close. I could feel Eric\u0027s body stiffen. Did the sound of her voice evoke an echo in his memory?\n \"The house is locked up tight,\" called Mark Stonebrook, from farther away.\n \"Well, we can take care of that.\" From the sound of her voice, she was on the move to the front door. She sounded amused.\n They were going to break into Bill\u0027s house! Surely I should prevent that? I must have made some sudden move, because Eric\u0027s body flattened mine against the trunk of the tree. My coat was worked up around my waist, and the bark bit into my butt through the thin material of my black pants.\n I could hear Hallow. She was chanting, her voice low and somehow ominous. She was actually casting a spell. That should have been exciting and I should have been curious: a real magic spell, cast by a real witch. But I felt scared, anxious to get away. The darkness seemed to thicken.\n \"I smell someone,\" Mark Stonebrook said.\n Fee, fie, foe, fum.\n \"What? Here and now?\" Hallow stopped her chant, sounding a little breathless.\n I began to tremble.\n \"Yeah.\" His voice came out deeper, almost a growl.\n \"Change,\" she ordered, just like that. I heard a sound I knew I\u0027d heard before, though I couldn\u0027t trace the memory. It was a sort of gloppy sound. Sticky. Like stirring a stiff spoon through some thick liquid that had hard things in it, maybe peanuts or toffee bits. Or bone chips.\n Then I heard a real howl. It wasn\u0027t human at all. Mark had changed, and it wasn\u0027t the full moon. This was real power. The night suddenly seemed full of life. Snuffling. Yipping. Tiny movements all around us.\n I was some great guardian for Eric, huh? I\u0027d let him sweep me over here. We were about to be discovered by a vampire-blood drinking Were witch, and who knows what all else, and I didn\u0027t even have Jason\u0027s shotgun. I put my arms around Eric and hugged him in apology.\n \"Sorry,\" I whispered, as tiny as a bee would whisper. But then I felt something brush against us, something large and furry, while I was hearing Mark\u0027s wolfy sounds from a few feet away on the other side of the tree. I bit my lip hard to keep from giving a yip myself.\n Listening intently, I became sure there were more than two animals. I would have given almost anything for a floodlight. From maybe ten yards away came a short, sharp bark. Another wolf? A plain old dog, in the wrong place at the wrong time?\n Suddenly, Eric left me. One minute, he was pressing me against the tree in the pitch-black dark, and the next minute, cold air hit me from top to bottom (so much for my holding on to his wrists). I flung my arms out, trying to discover where he was, and touched only air. Had he just stepped away so he could investigate what was happening? Had he decided to join in?\n Though my hands didn\u0027t encounter any vampires, something big and warm pressed against my legs. I used my fingers to better purpose by reaching down to explore the animal. I touched lots of fur: a pair of upright ears, a long muzzle, a warm tongue. I tried to move, to step away from the oak, but the dog (wolf?) wouldn\u0027t let me. Though it was smaller than I and weighed less, it leaned against me with such pressure that there was no way I could move. When I listened to what was going on in the darkness - a lot of growling and snarling - I decided I was actually pretty glad about that. I sank to my knees and put one arm across the canine\u0027s back. It licked my face.\n I heard a chorus of howls, which rose eerily into the cold night. The hair on my neck stood up, and I buried my face in the neck fur of my companion and prayed. Suddenly, over all the lesser noises, there was a howl of pain and a series of yips.\n I heard a car start up, and headlights cut cones into the night. My side of the tree was away from the light, but I could see that I was huddled by a dog, not a wolf. Then the lights moved and gravel sprayed from Bill\u0027s driveway as the car reversed. There was a moment\u0027s pause, I presumed while the driver shifted into drive, and then the car screeched and I heard it going at high speed down the hill to the turnoff onto Hummingbird Road. There was a terrible thud and a high shrieking sound that made my heart hammer even harder. It was the sound of a pain a dog makes when it\u0027s been hit by a car.\n \"Oh, Jesus,\" I said miserably, and clutched my furry friend. I thought of something I could do to help, now that it seemed the witches had left.\n I got up and ran for the front door of Bill\u0027s house before the dog could stop me. I pulled my keys out of my pocket as I ran. They\u0027d been in my hand when Eric had seized me at my back door, and I\u0027d stuffed them into my coat, where a handkerchief had kept them from jingling. I felt around for the lock, counted my keys until I arrived at Bill\u0027s - the third on the ring - and opened his front door. I reached in and flipped the outside light switch, and abruptly the yard was illuminated.\n It was full of wolves.\n I didn\u0027t know how scared I should be. Pretty scared, I guessed. I was just assuming both of the Were witches had been in the car. What if one of them was among the wolves present? And where was my vampire?\n That question got answered almost immediately. There was a sort of whump as Eric landed in the yard.\n \"I followed them to the road, but they went too fast for me there,\" he said, grinning at me as if we\u0027d been playing a game.\n A dog - a collie - went up to Eric, looked up at his face, and growled.\n \"Shoo,\" Eric said, making an imperious gesture with his hand.\n My boss trotted over to me and sat against my legs again. Even in the darkness, I had suspected that my guardian was Sam. The first time I\u0027d encountered him in this transformation, I\u0027d thought he was a stray, and I\u0027d named him Dean, after a man I knew with the same eye color. Now it was a habit to call him Dean when he went on four legs. I sat on Bill\u0027s front steps and the collie cuddled against me. I said, \"You are one great dog.\" He wagged his tail. The wolves were sniffing Eric, who was standing stock-still.\n A big wolf trotted over to me, the biggest wolf I\u0027d ever seen. Weres turn into large wolves, I guess; I haven\u0027t seen that many. Living in Louisiana, I\u0027ve never seen a standard wolf at all. This Were was almost pure black, which I thought was unusual. The rest of the wolves were more silvery, except for one that was smaller and reddish.\n The wolf gripped my coat sleeve with its long white teeth and tugged. I rose immediately and went over to the spot where most of the other wolves were milling. We were at the outer edge of the light, so I hadn\u0027t noticed the cluster right away. There was blood on the ground, and in the middle of the spreading pool lay a young dark-haired woman. She was naked.\n She was obviously and terribly injured.\n Her legs were broken, and maybe one arm.\n \"Go get my car,\" I told Eric, in the kind of voice that has to be obeyed.\n I tossed him my keys, and he took to the air again. In one available corner of my brain, I hoped that he remembered how to drive. I\u0027d noted that though he\u0027d forgotten his personal history, his modern skills were apparently intact.\n I was trying not to think about the poor injured girl right in front of me. The wolves circled and paced, whining. Then the big black one raised his head to the dark sky and howled again. This was a signal to all the others, who did the same thing. I glanced back to be sure that Dean was keeping away, since he was the outsider. I wasn\u0027t sure how much human personality was left after these two-natured people transformed, and I didn\u0027t want anything to happen to him. He was sitting on the small porch, out of the way, his eyes fixed on me.\n I was the only creature with opposable thumbs on the scene, and I was suddenly aware that that gave me a lot of responsibility.\n First thing to check? Breathing. Yes, she was! She had a pulse. I was no paramedic, but it didn\u0027t seem like a normal pulse to me - which would be no wonder. Her skin felt hot, maybe from the changeover back to human. I didn\u0027t see a terrifying amount of fresh blood, so I hoped that no major arteries had been ruptured.\n I slid a hand beneath the girl\u0027s head, very carefully, and touched the dusty dark hair, trying to see if her scalp was lacerated. No.\n Sometime during the process of this examination, I began shaking all over. Her injuries were really frightening. Everything I could see of her looked beaten, battered, broken. Her eyes opened. She shuddered. Blankets - she\u0027d need to be kept warm. I glanced around. All the wolves were still wolves.\n \"It would be great if one or two of you could change back,\" I told them. \"I have to get her to a hospital in my car, and she needs blankets from inside this house.\"\n One of the wolves, a silvery gray, rolled onto its side - okay, male wolf - and I heard the same gloppy noise again. A haze wrapped around the writhing figure, and when it dispersed, Colonel Flood was curled up in place of the wolf. Of course, he was naked, too, but I chose to rise above my natural embarrassment. He had to lie still for at least a minute or two, and it was o\n bviously a great effort for him to sit up.\n He crawled over to the injured girl. \"Maria-Star,\" he said hoarsely. He bent to smell her, which looked very weird when he was in human form. He whined in distress.\n He turned his head to look at me. He said, \"Where?\" and I understood he meant the blankets.\n \"Go in the house, go up the stairs. There\u0027s a bedroom at the head of the stairs. There\u0027s a blanket chest at the foot of the bed. Get two blankets out of there.\"\n He staggered to his feet, apparently having to deal with some disorientation from his rapid change, before he began striding toward the house.\n The girl - Maria-Star - followed him with her eyes.\n \"Can you talk?\" I asked.\n \"Yes,\" she said, barely audibly.\n \"Where does it hurt worst?\"\n \"I think my hips and legs are broken,\" she said. \"The car hit me.\"\n \"Did it throw you up in the air?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"The wheels didn\u0027t pass over you?\"\n She shuddered. \"No, it was the impact that hurt me.\"\n \"What\u0027s your full name? Maria-Star what?\" I\u0027d need to know for the hospital. She might not be conscious by then.\n \"Cooper,\" she whispered.\n By then, I could hear a car coming up Bill\u0027s drive.\n The colonel, moving more smoothly now, sped out of the house with the blankets, and all the wolves and the one human instantly arrayed themselves around me and their wounded pack member. The car was obviously a threat until they learned likewise. I admired the colonel. It took quite a man to face an approaching enemy stark naked.\n The new arrival was Eric, in my old car. He pulled up to Maria-Star and me with considerable panache and squealing brakes. The wolves circled restlessly, their glowing yellow eyes fixed on the driver\u0027s door. Calvin Norris\u0027s eyes had looked quite different; fleetingly, I wondered why.\n \"It\u0027s my car; it\u0027s okay,\" I said, when one of the Weres began growling. Several pairs of eyes turned to fix on me consideringly. Did I look suspicious, or tasty?\n As I finished wrapping Maria-Star in the blankets, I wondered which one of the wolves was Alcide. I suspected he was the largest, darkest one, the one that just that moment turned to look me in the eyes. Yes, Alcide. This was the wolf I\u0027d seen at Club Dead a few weeks ago, when Alcide had been my date on a night that had ended catastrophically - for me and a few other people.\n I tried to smile at him, but my face was stiff with cold and shock.\n Eric leaped out of the driver\u0027s seat, leaving the car running. He opened the back door. \"I\u0027ll put her in,\" he called, and the wolves began barking. They didn\u0027t want their pack sister handled by a vampire, and they didn\u0027t want Eric to be anywhere close to Maria-Star.\n Colonel Flood said, \"I\u0027ll lift her.\" Eric looked at the older man\u0027s slight physique and lifted a doubtful eyebrow, but had the sense to stand aside. I\u0027d wrapped the girl as well as I could without jarring her, but the colonel knew this was going to hurt her even worse. At the last minute, he hesitated.\n \"Maybe we should call the ambulance,\" he muttered.\n \"And explain this how?\" I asked. \"A bunch of wolves and a naked guy, and her being up here next to a private home where the owner\u0027s absent? I don\u0027t think so!\"\n \"Of course.\" He nodded, accepting the inevitable. Without even a hitch in his breathing, he stood with the bundle that was the girl and went to the car. Eric did run to the other side, open that door, and reach in to help pull her farther onto the backseat. The colonel permitted that. The girl shrieked once, and I scrambled behind the wheel as fast as I could. Eric got in the passenger side, and I said, \"You can\u0027t go.\"\n \"Why not?\" He sounded amazed and affronted.\n \"I\u0027ll have twice the explaining to do if I have a vampire with me!\" It took most people a few minutes to decide Eric was dead, but of course they would figure it out eventually. Eric stubbornly stayed put. \"And everyone\u0027s seeing your face on the damn posters,\" I said, working to keep my voice reasonable but urgent. \"I live among pretty good people, but there\u0027s no one in this parish who couldn\u0027t use that much money.\"\n He got out, not happily, and I yelled, \"Turn off the lights and relock the house, okay?\"\n \"Meet us at the bar when you have word about Maria-Star!\" Colonel Flood yelled back. \"We\u0027ve got to get our cars and clothes out of the cemetery.\" Okay, that explained the glimpse I\u0027d caught on the way over.\n As I steered slowly down the driveway, the wolves watched me go, Alcide standing apart from the rest, his black furry face turning to follow my progress. I wondered what wolfy thoughts he was thinking.\n The closest hospital was not in Bon Temps, which is way too small to have its own (we\u0027re lucky to have a WalMart), but in nearby Clarice, the parish seat. Luckily, it\u0027s on the outskirts of the town, on the side nearest Bon Temps. The ride to the Renard Parish Hospital only seemed to take years; actually, I got there in about twenty minutes. My passenger moaned for the first ten minutes, and then fell ominously silent. I talked to her, begged her to talk to me, asked her to tell me how old she was, and turned on the radio in attempt to spark some response from Maria-Star.\n I didn\u0027t want to take the time to pull over and check on her, and I wouldn\u0027t have known what to do if I had, so I drove like a bat out of hell. By the time I pulled up to the emergency entrance and called to the two nurses standing outside smoking, I was sure the poor Were was dead.\n She wasn\u0027t, judging from the activity that surrounded her in the next couple of minutes. Our parish hospital is a little one, of course, and it doesn\u0027t have the facilities that a city hospital can boast. We counted ourselves lucky to have a hospital at all. That night, they saved the Were\u0027s life.\n The doctor, a thin woman with graying spiked hair and huge black-rimmed glasses, asked me a few pointed questions that I couldn\u0027t answer, though I\u0027d been working on my basic story all the way to the hospital. After finding me clueless, the doctor made it clear I was to get the hell out of the way and let her team work. So I sat in a chair in the hall, and waited, and worked on my story some more.\n There was no way I could be useful here, and the glaring fluorescent lights and the gleaming linoleum made a harsh, unfriendly environment. I tried to read a magazine, and tossed it on the table after a couple of minutes. For the seventh or eighth time, I thought of skipping out. But there was a woman stationed at the night reception desk, and she was keeping a close eye on me. After a few more minutes, I decided to visit the women\u0027s room to wash the blood off my hands. While I was in there, I took a few swipes at my coat with a wet paper towel, which was largely a wasted effort.\n When I emerged from the women\u0027s room, there were two cops waiting for me. They were big men, both of them. They rustled with their synthetic padded jackets, and they creaked with the leather of their belts and equipment. I couldn\u0027t imagine them sneaking up on anyone.\n The taller man was the older. His steel gray hair was clipped close to his scalp. His face was carved with a few deep wrinkles, like ravines. His gut overhung his belt. His partner was a younger man, maybe thirty, with light brown hair and light brown eyes and light brown skin - a curiously monochromatic guy. I gave them a quick but comprehensive scan with all my senses.\n I could tell the two were both prepared to find out I\u0027d had a hand in the injuries of the girl I\u0027d brought in, or that I at least knew more than I was saying.\n Of course, they were partially right.\n \"Miss Stackhouse? You brought in the young woman Dr. Skinner is treating?\" the younger man said gently.\n \"Maria-Star,\" I said. \"Cooper.\"\n \"Tell us how you came to do that,\" the older cop said.\n It was definitely an order, though his tone was moderate. Neither man knew me or knew of me, I \"heard.\" Good.\n I took a deep breath and dove into the waters of mendacity. \"I was driving home from work,\" I said. \"I work at Merlotte\u0027s Bar - you know where that is?\"\n They both nodded. Of course, police would know the location of every bar in the parish.\n \"I saw a body lying by the side of the road, on the gravel of the shoulder,\" I said carefully, thinking ahead so I wouldn\u0027t say something I couldn\u0027t take back. \"So I stopped. There wasn\u0027t anyone else in sight. When I found out she was still alive, I knew I had to get to help. It took me a long time to get her into the car by myself.\" I was trying to account for the passage of time since I\u0027d left work and the gravel from Bill\u0027s driveway that I knew would be in her skin. I couldn\u0027t gauge how much care I needed to tell in putting my story together, but more care was better than less.\n \"Did you notice any skid marks on the road?\" The light brown policeman couldn\u0027t go long without asking a question.\n \"No, I didn\u0027t notice. They may have been there. I was just - after I saw her, all I thought about was her.\"\n \"So?\" the older man prompted.\n \"I could tell she was hurt real bad, so I got her here as fast as I could.\" I shrugged. End of my story.\n \"You didn\u0027t think about calling an ambulance?\"\n \"I don\u0027t have a cell phone.\"\n \"Woman who comes home from work that late, by herself, really ought to have a cell phone, ma\u0027am.\"\n I opened my mouth to tell him that if he felt like paying the bill, I\u0027d be glad to have one, when I restrained myself. Yes, it would be handy to have a cell phone, but I could barely afford my regular phone. My only extravagance was cable TV, and I justified that by telling myself it was my only recreational spending. \"I hear you,\" I said briefly.\n \"And your full name is?\" This from the younger man. I looked up, met his eyes.\n \"Sookie Stackhouse,\" I said. He\u0027d been thinking I seemed kind of shy and sweet.\n \"You the sister of the man who\u0027s missing?\" The gray-haired man bent down to look in my face.\n \"Yes, sir.\" I looked down at my toes again.\n \"You\u0027re sure having a streak of bad luck, Miss Stackhouse.\"\n \"Tell me about it,\" I said, my voice shaking with sincerity.\n \"Have you ever seen this woman, the woman you brought in, before tonight?\" The older officer was scribbling in a little notepad he\u0027d produced from a pocket. His name was Curlew, the little pin on his pocket said.\n I shook my head.\n \"You think your brother might have known her?\"\n I looked up, startled. I met the eyes of the brown man again. His name was Stans. \"How the heck would I know?\" I asked. I knew in the next second that he\u0027d just wanted me to look up again. He didn\u0027t know what to make of me. The monochromatic Stans thought I was pretty and seemed like a good little Samaritan. On the other hand, my job was one educated nice girls didn\u0027t often take, and my brother was well known as a brawler, though many of the patrol officers liked him.\n \"How is she doing?\" I asked.\n They both glanced at the door behind which the struggle to save the young woman went on.\n \"She\u0027s still alive,\" Stans said.\n \"Poor thing,\" I said. Tears rolled down my cheeks, and I began fumbling in my pockets for a tissue.\n \"Did she say anything to you, Miss Stackhouse?\"\n I had to think about that. \"Yes,\" I said. \"She did.\" The truth was safe, in this instance.\n They both brightened at the news.\n \"She told me her name. She said her legs hurt worst, when I asked her,\" I said. \"And she said that the car had hit her, but not run her over.\"\n The two men looked at each other.\n \"Did she describe the car?\" Stans asked.\n It was incredibly tempting to describe the witches\u0027 car. But I mistrusted the glee that bubbled up inside me at the idea. And I was glad I had, the next second, when I realized that the trace evidence they\u0027d get off the car would be wolf fur. Good thinking, Sook.\n \"No, she didn\u0027t,\" I said, trying to look as though I\u0027d been groping through my memory. \"She didn\u0027t really talk much after that, just moaning. It was awful.\" And the upholstery on my backseat was probably ruined, too. I immediately wished I hadn\u0027t thought of something so selfish.\n \"And you didn\u0027t see any other cars, trucks, any other vehicles on your way to your house from the bar, or even when you were coming back to town?\"\n That was a slightly different question. \"Not on my road,\" I said hesitantly. \"I probably saw a few cars when I got closer to Bon Temps and went through town. And of course I saw more between Bon Temps and Clarice. But I don\u0027t recall any in particular.\"\n \"Can you take us to the spot where you picked her up? The exact place?\"\n \"I doubt it. There wasn\u0027t anything to mark it besides her,\" I said. My coherence level was falling by the minute. \"No big tree, or road, or mile marker. Maybe tomorrow? In the daytime?\"\n Stans patted me on the shoulder. \"I know you\u0027re shook up, miss,\" he said consolingly. \"You done the best you could for this girl. Now we gotta leave it up to the doctors and the Lord.\"\n I nodded emphatically, because I certainly agreed. The older Curlew still looked at me a little skeptically, but he thanked me as a matter of form, and they strode out of the hospital into the blackness. I stepped back a little, though I remained looking out into the parking lot. In a second or two, they reached my car and shone their big flashlights through the windows, checking out the interior. I keep the inside of my car spanky-clean, so they wouldn\u0027t see a thing but bloodstains in the backseat. I noticed that they checked out the front grille, too, and I didn\u0027t blame them one little bit.\n They examined my car over and over, and finally they stood under one of the big lights, making notes on clipboards.\n Not too long after that, the doctor came out to find me. She pulled her mask down and rubbed the back of her neck with a long, thin hand. \"Miss Cooper is doing better. She\u0027s stable,\" she said.\n I nodded, and then I closed my eyes for a moment with sheer relief. \"Thank you,\" I croaked.\n \"We\u0027re going to airlift her to Schumpert in Shreveport. The helicopter\u0027ll be here any second.\"\n I blinked, trying to decide if that were a good thing or a bad thing. No matter what my opinion was, the Were had to go to the best and closest hospital. When she became able to talk, she\u0027d have to tell them something. How could I ensure that her story jibed with mine?\n \"Is she conscious?\" I asked.\n \"Just barely,\" the doctor said, almost angrily, as if such injuries were an insult to her personally. \"You can speak to her briefly, but I can\u0027t guarantee she\u0027ll remember, or understand. I have to go talk to the cops.\" The two officers were striding back into the hospital, I saw from my place at the window.\n \"Thank you,\" I said, and followed her gesture to her left. I pushed open the door into the grim glaring room where they\u0027d been working on the girl.\n It was a mess. There were a couple of nurses in there even now, chatting about this or that and packing away some of the unused packages of bandages and tubes. A man with a bucket and mop stood waiting in a corner. He would clean the room when the Were - the girl - had been wheeled out to the helicopter. I went to the side of the narrow bed and took her hand.\n I bent down close.\n \"Maria-Star, you know my voice?\" I asked quietly. Her face was swollen from its impact with the ground, and it was covered with scratches and scrapes. These were the smallest of her injuries, but they looked very painful to me.\n \"Yes,\" she breathed.\n \"I\u0027m the one that found you by the side of the road,\" I said. \"On the way to my house, south of Bon Temps. You were lying by the parish road.\"\n \"Understand,\" she murmured.\n \"I guess,\" I continued carefully, \"that someone made you get out of his car, and that someone then hit you with the car. But you know how it is after a trauma, sometimes people don\u0027t remember anything.\" One of the nurses turned to me, her face curious. She\u0027d caught the last part of my sentence. \"So don\u0027t worry if you don\u0027t remember.\"\n \"I\u0027ll try,\" she said ambiguously, still in that hushed, faraway voice.\n There was nothing more I could do here, and a lot more that could go wrong, so I whispered \"Good-bye,\" told the nurses I appreciated them, and went out to my car. Thanks to the blankets (which I supposed I\u0027d have to replace for Bill), my backseat wasn\u0027t messed up too bad.\n I was glad to find something to be pleased about.\n I wondered about the blankets. Did the police have them? Would the hospital call me about them? Or had they been pitched in the garbage? I shrugged. There was no point worrying about two rectangles of material anymore, when I had so much else crammed on my worry list. For one thing, I didn\u0027t like the Weres congregating at Merlotte\u0027s. That pulled Sam way too far into Were concerns. He was a shifter, after all, and shifters were much more loosely involved with the supernatural world. Shifters tended to be more \"every shifter for himself,\" while the Weres were always organized. Now they were using Merlotte\u0027s for a meeting place, after hours.\n And then there was Eric. Oh, Lord, Eric would be waiting for me at the house.\n I found myself wondering what time it was in Peru. Bill had to be having more fun than I was. It seemed like I\u0027d gotten worn out on New Year\u0027s Eve and never caught up; I\u0027d never felt this exhausted.\n I was just past the intersection where I\u0027d turned left, the road that eventually passed Merlotte\u0027s. The headlights illuminated flashes of trees and bushes. At least there were no more vampires running down the side...\n \"Wake up,\" said the woman sitting by me on the front seat.\n \"What?\" My eyelids popped open. The car swerved violently.\n \"You were falling asleep.\"\n By this time, I wouldn\u0027t have been surprised if a beached whale had lain across the road.\n \"You\u0027re who?\" I asked, when I felt my voice might be under my control.\n \"Claudine.\"\n It was hard to recognize her in the dashboard light, but sure enough, it seemed to be the tall and beautiful woman who\u0027d been in Merlotte\u0027s New Year\u0027s Eve, who\u0027d been with Tara the previous morning. \"How did you get in my car? Why are you here?\"\n \"Because there\u0027s been an unusual amount of supernatural activity in this area in the past week or two. I\u0027m the go-between.\"\n \"Go between what?\"\n \"Between the two worlds. Or, more accurately, between the three worlds.\"\n Sometimes life just hands you more than you take. Then you just accept.\n \"So, you\u0027re like an angel? That\u0027s how come you woke me up when I was falling asleep at the wheel?\"\n \"No, I haven\u0027t gotten that far yet. You\u0027re too tired to take this in. You have to ignore the mythology and just accept me for what I am.\"\n I felt a funny jolt in my chest.\n \"Look,\" Claudine pointed out. \"That man\u0027s waving to you.\"\n Sure enough, in Merlotte\u0027s parking lot there stood a semaphoring vampire. It was Chow.\n \"Oh, just great,\" I said, in the grumpiest voice I could manage. \"Well, I hope you don\u0027t mind us stopping, Claudine. I need to go in.\"\n \"Sure, I wouldn\u0027t miss it.\"\n Chow waved me to the rear of the bar, and I was astonished to find the employee parking area jam-packed with cars that had been invisible from the road.\n \"Oh, boy!\" Claudine said. \"A party!\" She got out of my car as if she could hardly restrain her glee, and I had the satisfaction of seeing that Chow was absolutely stupefied when he took in all six feet of her. It\u0027s hard to surprise a vampire.\n \"Let\u0027s go in,\" Claudine said gaily, and took my hand. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-to-the-world-sookie-stackhouse-4/page-9.html","bookId":2194,"book":{"id":2194,"title":"Dead to the World (Sookie Stackhouse #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Dead to the World (Sookie Stackhouse #4) \n Sookie Stackhouse is a cocktail waitress in Bon Temps, Louisiana. She has only a few close friends, because not everyone appreciates Sookie’s gift: she can read minds. That’s not exactly every man’s idea of date bait – unless they’re undead; vampires and the like can be tough to read. And that’s just the kind of guy Sookie’s been looking for. Maybe that’s why, when she comes across a naked vampire, she doesn’t just drive on by. He hasn’t got a clue who he is, but Sookie has: Eric looks just as scary and sexy – and dead – as ever. But now he has amnesia, he’s sweet, vulnerable, and in need of Sookie’s help – because whoever took his memory now wants his life.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/dead-to-the-world-sookie-stackhouse-4.jpg","author":"Charlaine Harris","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/dead-to-the-world-sookie-stackhouse-4.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:26 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:55:56 PM"}}
