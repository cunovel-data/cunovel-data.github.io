{"id":100769,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"10 The pond behind Jason\u0027s house had already been searched by the time I got up the next morning. Alcee Beck pounded on my door about ten o\u0027clock, and since it sounded exactly like a lawman knocking, I pulled on my jeans and a sweatshirt before I went to the door. \"He\u0027s not in the pond,\" Beck said, without preamble. I sagged against the doorway. \"Oh, thank God.\" I closed my eyes for a minute to do just that. \"Please come in.\" Alcee Beck stepped over the threshold like a vampire, looking around him silently and with a certain wariness. \"Would you like some coffee?\" I asked politely, when he was seated on the old couch. \"No, thank you,\" he said stiffly, as uncomfortable with me as I was with him. I spotted Eric\u0027s shirt hanging on the doorknob of my bedroom, not quite visible from where Detective Beck was sitting. Lots of women wear men\u0027s shirts, and I told myself not to be paranoid about its presence. Though I tried not to listen to the detective\u0027s mind, I could tell that he was uneasy being alone in the house of a white woman, and he was wishing that Andy Bellefleur would get there. \"Excuse me for a minute,\" I said, before I yielded to temptation and asked him why Andy was due to arrive. That would shake Alcee Beck to the core. I grabbed the shirt as I went into my room, folded it, and tucked it in a drawer before I brushed my teeth and washed my face. By the time I returned to the living room, Andy had made his appearance. Jason\u0027s boss, Catfish Hennessey, was with him. I could feel the blood leaving my head and I sat down very heavily on the ottoman sitting by the couch. \"What?\" I said. I couldn\u0027t have uttered another word. \"The blood on the dock is probably feline blood, and there\u0027s a print in it, besides Jason\u0027s boot print,\" said Andy. \"We\u0027ve kept this quiet, because we didn\u0027t want those woods crawling with idiots.\" I could feel myself swaying in an invisible wind. I would have laughed, if I hadn\u0027t had the \"gift\" of telepathy. He wasn\u0027t thinking tabby or calico when he said feline; he was thinking panther. Panthers were what we called mountain lions. Sure, there aren\u0027t mountains around here, but panthers - the oldest men hereabouts called them \"painters\" - live in low bottomland, too. To the best of my knowledge, the only place panthers could be found in the wild was in Florida, and their numbers were dwindling to the brink of extinction. No solid evidence had been produced to prove that any live native panthers had been living in Louisiana in the past fifty years, give or take a decade. But of course, there were stories. And our wo ods and streams could produce no end of alligators, nutria, possums, coons, and even the occasional black bear or wildcat. Coyotes, too. But there were no pictures, or scat, or print casts, to prove the presence of panthers... until now. Andy Bellefleur\u0027s eyes were hot with longing, but not for me. Any red-blooded male who\u0027d ever gone hunting, or even any P.C. guy who photographed nature, would give almost anything to see a real wild panther. Despite the fact that these large predators were deeply anxious to avoid humans, humans would not return the favor. \"What are you thinking?\" I asked, though I knew damn good and well what they were thinking. But to keep them on an even keel, I had to pretend not to; they\u0027d feel better, and they might let something slip. Catfish was just thinking that Jason was most likely dead. The two lawmen kept fixing me in their gaze, but Catfish, who knew me better than they did, was sitting forward on the edge of Gran\u0027s old recliner, his big red hands clasped to each other so hard the knuckles were white. \"Maybe Jason spotted the panther when he came home that night,\" Andy said carefully. \"You know he\u0027d run and get his rifle and try to track it.\" \"They\u0027re endangered,\" I said. \"You think Jason doesn\u0027t know that panthers are endangered?\" Of course, they thought Jason was so impulsive and brainless that he just wouldn\u0027t care. \"Are you sure that would be at the top of his list?\" Alcee Beck asked, with an attempt at gentleness. \"So you think Jason shot the panther,\" I said, having a little difficulty getting the words out of my mouth. \"It\u0027s a possibility.\" \"And then what?\" I crossed my arms over my chest. All three men exchanged a glance. \"Maybe Jason followed the panther into the woods,\" Andy said. \"Maybe the panther wasn\u0027t so badly wounded after all, and it got him.\" \"You think my brother would trail a wounded and dangerous animal into the woods - at night, by himself.\" Sure they did. I could read it loud and clear. They thought that would be absolutely typical Jason Stackhouse behavior. What they didn\u0027t get was that (reckless and wild as my brother was) Jason\u0027s favorite person in the entire universe was Jason Stackhouse, and he would not endanger that person in such an obvious way. Andy Bellefleur had some misgivings about this theory, but Alcee Beck sure didn\u0027t. He thought I\u0027d outlined Jason\u0027s procedure that night exactly. What the two lawmen didn\u0027t know, and what I couldn\u0027t tell them, was that if Jason had seen a panther at his house that night, the chances were good the panther was actually a shape-shifting human. Hadn\u0027t Claudine said that the witches had gathered some of the larger shifters into their fold? A panther would be a valuable animal to have at your side if you were contemplating a hostile takeover. \"Jay Stans, from Clarice, called me this morning,\" Andy said. His round face turned toward me and his brown eyes locked on me. \"He was telling me about this gal you found by the side of the road last night.\" I nodded, not seeing the connection, and too preoccupied with speculation about the panther to guess what was coming. \"This girl have any connection to Jason?\" \"What?\" I was stunned. \"What are you talking about?\" \"You find this girl, this Maria-Star Cooper, by the side of the road. They searched, but they didn\u0027t find any trace of an accident.\" I shrugged. \"I told them I wasn\u0027t sure I could pin the spot down, and they didn\u0027t ask me to go looking, after I offered. I\u0027m not real surprised they couldn\u0027t find any evidence, not knowing the exact spot. I tried to pin it down, but it was at night, and I was pretty scared. Or she could have just been dumped where I found her.\" I don\u0027t watch the Discovery Channel for nothing. \"See, what we were thinking,\" Alcee Beck rumbled, \"is that this girl was one of Jason\u0027s discards, and maybe he was keeping her somewhere secret? But you let her go when Jason disappeared.\" \"Huh?\" It was like they were speaking Urdu or something. I couldn\u0027t make any sense out of it. \"With Jason getting arrested under suspicion of those murders last year and all, we wondered if there wasn\u0027t some fire under all that smoke.\" \"You know who did those killings. He\u0027s in jail, unless something\u0027s happened that I don\u0027t know about. And he confessed.\" Catfish met my eyes, and his were very uneasy. This line of questioning had my brother\u0027s boss all twitchy. Granted, my brother was a little kinky in the sex department (though none of the women he\u0027d kinked with seemed to mind), but the idea of him keeping a sex slave that I had to deal with when he vanished? Oh, come on! \"He did confess, and he\u0027s still in jail,\" Andy said. Since Andy had taken the confession, I should hope so. \"But what if Jason was his accomplice?\" \"Wait a damn minute now,\" I said. My pot was beginning to boil over. \"You can\u0027t have it both ways. If my brother is dead out in the woods after chasing a mythical wounded panther, how could he have been holding, what\u0027s her name, Maria-Star Cooper, hostage somewhere? You\u0027re thinking I\u0027ve been in on my brother\u0027s supposed bondage activities, too? You think I hit her with my car? And then I loaded her in and drove her to the emergency room?\" We all glared at each other for a long moment. The men were tossing out waves of tension and confusion like they were necklaces at Mardi Gras. Then Catfish launched himself off the couch like a bottle rocket. \"No,\" he bellowed. \"You guys asked me to come along to break this bad news about the panther to Sookie. No one said anything about this stuff about some girl that got hit by a car! This here is a nice girl.\" Catfish pointed at me. \"No one\u0027s going to call her different! Not only did Jason Stackhouse never have to do more than crook his little finger at a girl for her to come running, much less take one hostage and do weird stuff to her, but if you\u0027re saying Sookie let this Cooper girl free when Jason didn\u0027t come home, and then tried to run over her, well, all I got to say is, you can go straight to hell!\" God bless Catfish Hennessey is all I had to say. Alcee and Andy left soon after, and Catfish and I had a disjointed talk consisting mostly of him cursing the lawmen. When he ran down, he glanced at his watch. \"Come on, Sookie. You and me got to get to Jason\u0027s.\" \"Why?\" I was willing but bewildered. \"We got us a search party together, and I know you\u0027ll want to be there.\" I stared at him with my mouth open, while Catfish fumed about Alcee and Andy\u0027s allegations. I tried real hard to think of some way to cancel a search party. I hated to think of those men and women putting on all their winter gear to plow through the underbrush, now bare and brown, that made the woods so difficult to navigate. But there was no way to stop them, when they meant so well; and there was every reason to join them. There was the remote chance that Jason was out there in the woods somewhere. Catfish told me he\u0027d gotten together as many men as he could, and Kevin Pryor had agreed to be the coordinator, though off-duty. Maxine Fortenberry and her churchwomen were bringing out coffee and doughnuts from the Bon Temps Bakery. I began crying, because this was just overwhelming, and Catfish turned even redder. Weeping women were way high on Catfish\u0027s long list of things that made him uncomfortable. I eased his situation by telling him I had to get ready. I threw the bed together, washed my face clean of tears, and yanked my hair back into a ponytail. I found a pair of ear-muffs that I used maybe once a year, and pulled on my old coat and stuck my yard work gloves in my pocket, along with a wad of Kleenex in case I got weepy again. The search party was the popular activity for the day in Bon Temps. Not only do people like to help in our small town - but also rumors had inevitably begun circulating about the mysterious wild animal footprint. As far as I could tell, the word \"panther\" was not yet currency; if it had been, the crowd would have been even larger. Most of the men had come armed - well, actually, most of the men were always armed. Hunting is a way of life around here, the NRA provides most of the bumper stickers, and deer season is like a holy holiday. There are special times for hunting deer with a bow and arrow, with a muzzleloader, or with a rifle. (There may be a spear season, for all I know.) There must have been fifty people at Jason\u0027s house, quite a party on a workday for such a small community. Sam was there, and I was so glad to see him I almost began crying again. Sam was the best boss I\u0027d ever had, and a friend, and he always came when I was in trouble. His red-gold hair was covered with a bright orange knit cap, and he wore bright orange gloves, too. His heavy brown jacket looked somber in contrast, and like all of the men, he was wearing work boots. You didn\u0027t go out in the woods, even in winter, with ankles unprotected. Snakes were slow and sluggish, but they were there, and they\u0027d retaliate if you stepped on them. Somehow the presence of all these people made Jason\u0027s disappearance seem that much more terrifying. If all these people believed Jason might be out in the woods, dead or badly wounded, he might be. Despite every sensible thing I could tell myself, I grew more and more afraid. I had a few minutes of blanking out on the scene entirely while I imagined all the things that could have happened to Jason, for maybe the hundredth go-round. Sam was standing beside me, when I could hear and see again. He\u0027d pulled off a glove, and his hand found mine and clasped it. His felt warm and hard, and I was glad to be holding on to him. Sam, though a shifter, knew how to aim his thoughts at me, though he couldn\u0027t \"hear\" mine in return. Do you really believe he\u0027s out there? he asked me. I shook my head. Our eyes met and held. Do you think he\u0027s still alive? That was a lot harder. Finally, I just shrugged. He kept hold of my hand, and I was glad of it. Arlene and Tack scrambled out of Arlene\u0027s car and came toward us. Arlene\u0027s hair was as bright red as ever, but quite a bit more snarled than she usually wore it, and the short-order cook needed to shave. So he hadn\u0027t started keeping a razor at Arlene\u0027s yet, was the way I read it. \"Did you see Tara?\" Arlene asked. \"No.\" \"Look.\" She pointed, as surreptitiously as you can, and I saw Tara in jeans and rubber boots that came up to her knees. She looked as unlike the meticulously groomed clothing-store proprietor as I could imagine, though she was wearing an adorable fake-fur hat of white and brown that made you want to go up and stroke her head. Her coat matched the hat. So did her gloves. But from the waist down, Tara was ready for the woods. Jason\u0027s friend Dago was staring at Tara with the stunned look of the newly smitten. Holly and Danielle had come, too, and since Danielle\u0027s boyfriend wasn\u0027t around, the search party was turning out to have an unexpected social side. Maxine Fortenberry and two other women from her church had let down the tailgate of Maxine\u0027s husband\u0027s old pickup, and there were several thermoses containing coffee set up there, along with disposable cups, plastic spoons, and packages of sugar. Six dozen doughnuts steamed up the long boxes they\u0027d been packed in. A large plastic trash can, already lined with a black bag, stood ready. Theses ladies knew how to throw a search party. I couldn\u0027t believe all this had been organized in the space of a few hours. I had to take my hand from Sam\u0027s to fish out a tissue and mop my face with it. I would have expected Arlene to come, but the presence of Holly and Danielle was just about stunning, and Tara\u0027s attendance was even more surprising. She wasn\u0027t a search-the-woods kind of woman. Kevin Pryor didn\u0027t have much use for Jason, but here he was, with a map and pad and pencil, organizing away. I caught Holly\u0027s eye, and she gave me a sad sort of smile, the kind of little smile you gave someone at a funeral. Just then Kevin banged the plastic trash can lid against the tailgate of the truck, and when everyone\u0027s attention was on him, he began to give directions for the search. I hadn\u0027t realized Kevin could be so authoritative; on most occasions, he was overshadowed by his clingy mother, Jeneen, or his oversized partner, Kenya. You wouldn\u0027t catch Kenya out in the woods looking for Jason, I reflected, and just then I spotted her and had to swallow my own thoughts. In sensible gear, she was leaning against the Fortenberrys\u0027 pickup, her brown face absolutely expressionless. Her stance suggested that she was Kevin\u0027s enforcer - that she\u0027d move or speak only if he were challenged in some way. Kenya knew how to project silent menace; I\u0027ll give her that. She would throw a bucket of water on Jason if he were on fire, but her feelings for my brother were certainly not overwhelmingly positive. She\u0027d come because Kevin was volunteering. As Kevin divided people up into teams, her dark eyes left him only to scan the faces of the searchers, including mine. She gave me a slight nod, and I gave her the same. \"Each group of five has to have a rifleman,\" Kevin called. \"That can\u0027t be just anybody. It has to be someone who\u0027s spent time out in the woods hunting.\" The excitement level rose to the boiling point with this directive. But after that, I didn\u0027t listen to the rest of Kevin\u0027s instructions. I was still tired from the day before, for one thing; what an exceptionally full day it had been. And the whole time, in the background, my fear for my brother had been nagging and eating at me. I\u0027d been woken early this morning after a long night, and here I was standing in the cold outside my childhood home, waiting to participate in a touching wild goose chase - or at least I hoped it was a wild goose chase. I was too dazed to judge any more. A chill wind began to gust through the clearing around the house, making the tears on my cheeks unbearably cold. Sam put his arms around me, though in our coats it was quite awkward. It seemed to me I could feel the warmth of him even through all the material. \"You know we won\u0027t find him out there,\" he whispered to me. \"I\u0027m pretty sure we won\u0027t,\" I said, sounding anything but certain. Sam said, \"I\u0027ll smell him if he\u0027s out there.\" That was so practical. I looked up at him. I didn\u0027t have to look far, because Sam\u0027s not a real tall man. Right now, his face was very serious. Sam has more fun with his shifter self than most of the two-natured, but I could tell he was intent on easing my fear. When he was in his second nature, he had the dog\u0027s keen sense of smell; when he was in his human form, that sense was still superior to that of a one-natured man. Sam would be able to smell a fairly recent corpse. \"You\u0027re going out in the woods,\" I said. \"Sure. I\u0027ll do my best. If he\u0027s there, I think I\u0027ll know.\" Kevin had told me the sheriff had tried to hire the tracking dogs trained by a Shreveport police officer, but the officer had said they were booked for the day. I wondered if that were true, or if the man just hadn\u0027t wanted to risk his dogs in the woods with a panther. Truthfully, I couldn\u0027t blame him. And here was a better offer, right in front of me. \"Sam,\" I said, my eyes filling with tears. I tried to thank him, but the words wouldn\u0027t come. I was lucky to have a friend like Sam, and well I knew it. \"Hush, Sookie,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t cry. We\u0027ll find out what happened to Jason, and we\u0027ll find a way to restore Eric to his mind.\" He rubbed the tears off my cheeks with his thumb. No one was close enough to hear, but I couldn\u0027t help glancing around to make sure. \"Then,\" Sam said, a distinctly grim edge to his voice, \"we can get him out of your house and back to Shreveport where he belongs.\" I decided no reply was the best policy. \"What was your word for the day?\" he asked, standing back. I gave him a watery smile. Sam always asked about the daily offering of my Word a Day calendar. \"I didn\u0027t check this morning. Yesterday was \u0027farrago,\u0027\" I said. He raised his brows inquiringly. \"A confused mess,\" I said. \"Sookie, we\u0027ll find a way out of this.\" When the searchers divided up into groups, I discovered that Sam was not the only two-natured creature out in Jason\u0027s yard that day. I was astonished to see a contingent from Hotshot. Calvin Norris, his niece Crystal, and a second man who seemed vaguely familiar were standing by themselves. After a moment of stirring the sludge of my memory, I realized that the second man was the one I\u0027d seen emerging from the shed behind the house down from Crystal\u0027s. His thick pale hair triggered the memory, and I was sure of it when I saw the graceful way he moved. Kevin assigned the Reverend Jimmy Fullenwilder to the trio as their armed man. The combination of the three Weres with the reverend would have made me laugh under other circumstances. Since they lacked a fifth, I joined them. The three Weres from Hotshot gave me sober nods, Calvin\u0027s golden green eyes fixed on me thoughtfully. \"This here\u0027s Felton Norris,\" he said, by way of introduction. I nodded back to Felton, and Jimmy Fullenwilder, a gray-haired man of about sixty, shook hands. \"Of course I know Miss Sookie, but the rest of you I\u0027m not sure of. I\u0027m Jimmy Fullenwilder, pastor of Greater Love Baptist,\" he said, smiling all around. Calvin absorbed this information with a polite smile, Crystal sneered, and Felton Norris (had they run out of last names in Hotshot?) grew colder. Felton was an odd one, even for an inbred werewolf. His eyes were remarkably dark, set under straight thick brown brows, which contrasted sharply with his pale hair. His face was broad at the eyes, narrowing a little too abruptly to a thin-lipped mouth. Though he was a bulky man, he moved lightly and quietly, and as we began to move out into the woods, I realized that all the Hotshot residents had that in common. In comparison with the Norrises, Jimmy Fullenwilder and I were blundering elephants. At least the minister carried his 30-30 like he knew how to use it. Following our instructions, we stood in a row, stretching out our arms at shoulder height so we were fingertip to fingertip. Crystal was on my right, and Calvin was on my left. The other groups did the same. We began the search in the fanlike shape determined by the curve of the pond. \"Remember who\u0027s in your group,\" Kevin bellowed. \"We don\u0027t want to leave people out here! Now, start.\" We began scanning the ground ahead of us, moving at a steady pace. Jimmy Fullenwilder was a couple of steps ahead, since he was armed. It was apparent right away that there were woodcraft disparities between the Hotshot folks, the reverend, and me. Crystal seemed to flow through the undergrowth, without having to wade through it or push it aside, though I could hear her progress. Jimmy Fullenwilder, an avid hunter, was at home in the woods and an experienced outdoorsman, and I could tell he was getting much more information from his surroundings than I was, but he wasn\u0027t able to move like Calvin and Felton. They glided through the woods like ghosts, making about as much noise. Once, when I ran into a particularly dense thicket of thorny vines, I felt two hands clamp on either side of my waist, and I was just lifted over it before I had a chance to react. Calvin Norris put me down very gently and went right back to his position. I don\u0027t think anyone else noticed. Jimmy Fullenwilder, the only one who would have been startled, had gotten a little ahead. Our team found nothing: not a shred of cloth or flesh, not a boot print or panther print, not a smell or a trace or a drop of blood. One of the other teams yelled over that they\u0027d found a chewed-up possum corpse, but there was no immediate way to tell what had caused its death. The going got tougher. My brother had hunted in these woods, allowed some friends of his to hunt there, but otherwise had not interfered with nature in the twenty acres around the house. That meant he hadn\u0027t cleared away fallen branches or pulled up seedlings, which compounded the difficulty of our movement. My team happened to be the one that found his deer stand, which he and Hoyt had built together about five years ago. Though the stand faced a natural clearing running roughly north-south, the woods were so thick around it that we were temporarily out of sight of the other searchers, which I would not have thought possible in winter, with the branches bare. Every now and then a human voice, raised in a distant call, would make its way through the pines and the bushes and the branches of the oaks and gum trees, but the sense of isolation was overwhelming. Felton Norris swarmed up the deer stand ladder in such an unhuman way that I had to distract Reverend Fullenwilder by asking him if he\u0027d mind praying in church for my brother\u0027s return. Of course, he told me he already had, and furthermore, he notified me he\u0027d be glad to see me in his church on Sunday to add my voice to those lifted in prayer. Though I missed a lot of churchgoing because of my job, and when I did go I attended the Methodist church (which Jimmy Fullenwilder well knew), I pretty much had to say yes. Just then Felton called down that the stand was empty. \"Come down careful, this ladder\u0027s not too steady,\" Calvin called back, and I realized Calvin was warning Felton to look human when he descended. As the shifter descended slowly and clumsily, I met Calvin\u0027s eyes, and he looked amused. Bored by the wait at the foot of the deer stand, Crystal had flitted ahead of our point man, the Reverend Fullenwilder, something Kevin had warned us not to do. Just as I was thinking, I can\u0027t see her, I heard her scream. In the space of a couple of seconds, Calvin and Felton had bounded over the clearing toward the sound of Crystal\u0027s voice, and the Reverend Jimmy and I were left to run behind. I hoped the agitation of the moment would obscure his perception of the way Calvin and Felton were moving. Up ahead of us, we heard an indescribable noise, a loud chorus of squeals and frenetic movement coming from the undergrowth. Then a hoarse shout and another shrill scream came to us muffled by the cold thickness of the woods. We heard yelling from all directions as the other searchers responded, hurrying toward the alarming sounds. My heel caught in a snarl of vines and I went down, ass over teacup. Though I rolled to my feet and began running again, Jimmy Fullenwilder had gotten ahead of me, and as I plunged through a stand of low pines, each no bigger around than a mailing tube, I heard the boom of the rifle. Oh, my God, I thought. Oh, my God, The little clearing was filled with blood and tumult. A huge animal was thrashing in the dead leaves, spraying scarlet drops on everything in its vicinity. But it was no panther. For the second time in my life, I was seeing a razorback hog, that ferocious feral pig that grows to a huge size. In the time it took me to realize what was in front of me, the sow collapsed and died. She reeked of pig and blood. A crashing and squealing in the undergrowth around us indicated she hadn\u0027t been alone when Crystal stumbled upon her. But not all the blood was the sow\u0027s. Crystal Norris was swearing a blue streak as she sat with her back against an old oak, her hands clamped over her gored thigh. Her jeans were wet with her own blood, and her uncle and her - well, I didn\u0027t know what relationship Felton bore to Crystal, but I was sure there was one - kinsman were bending over her. Jimmy Fullenwilder was standing with his rifle still pointed at the beast, and he had an expression on his face that I can only describe as shell-shocked. \"How is she?\" I asked the two men, and only Calvin looked up. His eyes had gone very peculiar, and I realized they\u0027d gotten more yellow, rounder. He cast an unmistakable look at the huge carcass, a look of sheer desire. There was blood around his mouth. There was a patch of fur on the back of his hand, kind of buff-colored. He must make a strange-looking wolf. I pointed silently at this evidence of his nature, and he shivered with longing as he nodded acknowledgment. I yanked a handkerchief out of my coat pocket, spat on it, and wiped his face with it before Jimmy Fullenwilder could fall out of his fascination with his kill and observe his strange companions. When Calvin\u0027s mouth wasn\u0027t stained anymore, I knotted the handkerchief around his hand to conceal the fur. Felton seemed to be normal, until I observed what was at the end of his arms. They weren\u0027t really hands anymore... but not really wolf paws, either. They were something very odd, something big and flat and clawed. I couldn\u0027t read the men\u0027s thoughts, but I could feel their desires, and most of those desires had to do with raw red pig meat, and lots of it. Felton actually rocked back and forth once or twice with the force of his desire. Their silent struggle was painful to endure, even secondhand. I felt the change when the two men began to force their brains into human patterns. In a few seconds, Calvin managed to speak. \"She\u0027s losing blood fast, but if we get her to the hospital she\u0027ll be all right.\" His voice was thick, and he spoke with an effort. Felton, his eyes still downcast, began tearing clumsily at his flannel shirt. With his hands misshapen, he couldn\u0027t manage the job, and I took it over. When Crystal\u0027s wound was bound as tightly as the makeshift bandage could compress it, the two men lifted the now white and silent Crystal and began to carry her rapidly out of the woods. The position of Felton\u0027s hands hid them from sight, thank God. This all occurred so quickly that the other searchers converging on the clearing were just beginning to absorb what had happened, and react. \"I shot a hog,\" Jimmy Fullenwilder was saying, shaking his head from side to side, as Kevin and Kenya burst into the clearing from the east. \"I can\u0027t believe it. It just threw her over and the other sows and little ones scattered and then the two men were on it, and then they got out of the way and I shot it in the throat.\" He didn\u0027t know if he was a hero or if he was in big trouble with the Department of Wildlife. He\u0027d had more to fear than he would ever realize. Felton and Calvin had almost gone into full Were mode at the threat to Crystal and the arousal of their own hunting instincts, and the fact that they\u0027d thrown themselves away from the pig rather than change utterly proved they were very strong, indeed. But the fact that they\u0027d begun to change, hadn\u0027t been able to stop it, seemed to argue the opposite. The line between the two natures of some of the denizens of Hotshot seemed be growing very blurred. In fact, there were bite marks on the hog. I was so overwhelmed with anxiety that I couldn\u0027t keep up my guard, and all the excitement of all the searchers poured into my head - all the revulsion/fear/panic at the sight of the blood, the knowledge that a searcher had been seriously injured, the envy of other hunters at Jimmy Fullenwilder\u0027s coup. It was all too much, and I wanted to get away more than I\u0027ve ever wanted anything. \"Let\u0027s go. This\u0027ll be the end of the search, at least for today,\" Sam said at my elbow. We walked out of the woods together, very slowly. I told Maxine what had happened, and after I\u0027d thanked her for her wonderful contribution and accepted a box of doughnuts, I drove home. Sam followed me. I was a little more myself by the time we got there. As I unlocked the back door, it felt quite strange knowing that there was actually someone else already in the house. Was Eric conscious on some level of my footsteps on the floor above his head - or was he as dead as an ordinary dead person? But the wondering ran through my head and out the other side, because I was just too overloaded to consider it. Sam began to make coffee. He was somewhat at home in the kitchen, as he\u0027d dropped in a time or two when my Gran was alive, and he\u0027d visited on other occasions. As I hung up our coats, I said, \"That was a disaster.\" Sam didn\u0027t disagree. \"Not only did we not find Jason, which I truly never expected we would, but the guys from Hotshot almost got outed, and Crystal got hurt. I don\u0027t know why they thought they should be there anyway, frankly.\" I know it wasn\u0027t nice of me to say that, but I was with Sam, who\u0027d seen enough of my bad side to be under no illusions. \"I talked to them before you got there. Calvin wanted to show he was willing to court you, in a Hotshot kind of way,\" Sam said, his voice quiet and even. \"Felton is their best tracker, so he made Felton come, and Crystal just wanted to find Jason.\" Instantly I felt ashamed of myself. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said, holding my head in my hands and dropping into a chair. \"I\u0027m sorry.\" Sam knelt in front of me and put his hands on my knees. \"You\u0027re entitled to be cranky,\" he said. I bent over him and kissed the top of his head. \"I don\u0027t know what I\u0027d do without you,\" I said, without any thought at all. He looked up at me, and there was a long, odd moment, when the light in the room seemed to dance and shiver. \"You\u0027d call Arlene,\" he said with a smile. \"She\u0027d come over with the kids, and she\u0027d try to spike your coffee, and she\u0027d tell you about Tack\u0027s angled dick, and she\u0027d get you to laughing, and you\u0027d feel better.\" I blessed him for letting the moment pass. \"You know, that kind of makes me curious, that bit about Tack, but it probably falls into the category of \u0027too much information,\u0027\" I said. \"I thought so, too, but that didn\u0027t prevent me from hearing it when she was telling Charlsie Tooten.\" I poured us each a cup of coffee and put the half-empty sugar bowl within Sam\u0027s reach, along with a spoon. I glanced over at the kitchen counter to see how full the clear sugar canister was, and I noticed that the message light on the answering machine was blinking. I only had to get up and take a step to press the button. The message had been recorded at 5:01 A.M. Oh. I\u0027d turned the phone ringer off when I\u0027d gone to bed exhausted. Almost invariably my messages were real mundane - Arlene asking me if I\u0027d heard a piece of gossip, Tara passing the time of day during a slow hour at the store - but this one was a real doozy. Pam\u0027s clear voice said, \"Tonight we attack the witch and her coven. The Weres have persuaded the local Wiccans to join us. We need you to bring Eric. He can fight, even if he doesn\u0027t know who he is. He will be useless to us if we can\u0027t break the spell, anyway.\" That Pam, ever practical. She was willing to use Eric for cannon fodder, since we might not be able to restore him to full Eric leadership mode. After a little pause, she continued, \"The Weres of Shreveport are allying with vampires in battle. You can watch history being made, my telepathic friend.\" The sound of the phone being put back in the cradle. The click that heralded the next message, which came in two minutes after the first. \"Thinking of that,\" Pam said, as if she\u0027d never hung up, \"there is the idea that your unusual ability can help us in our fight, and we want to explore that. Isn\u0027t that the right buzzword now? Explore? So get here as close to first dark as possible.\" She hung up again. Click. \"\u0027Here\u0027 is 714 Parchman Avenue,\" Pam said. Hung up. \"How can I do that, with Jason still missing?\" I asked, when it became clear Pam hadn\u0027t called again. \"You\u0027re going to sleep now,\" Sam said. \"Come on.\" He pulled me to my feet, led me to my room. \"You\u0027re going to take off your boots and jeans, crawl back in the bed, and take a long nap. When you get up, you\u0027ll feel better. You leave Pam\u0027s number so I can reach you. Tell the cops to call the bar if they learn anything, and I\u0027ll phone you if I hear from Bud Dearborn.\" \"So you think I should do this?\" I was bewildered. \"No, I\u0027d give anything if you wouldn\u0027t. But I think you have to. It\u0027s not my fight; I wasn\u0027t invited.\" Sam gave me a kiss on the forehead and left to go back to Merlotte\u0027s. His attitude was kind of interesting, after all the vampire insistence (both Bill\u0027s and Eric\u0027s) that I was a possession to be guarded. I felt pretty empowered and gung-ho for about thirty seconds, until I remembered my New Year\u0027s resolution: no getting beaten up. If I went to Shreveport with Eric, then I was sure to see things I didn\u0027t want to see, learn things I didn\u0027t want to know, and get my ass whipped, too. On the other hand, my brother Jason had made a deal with the vampires, and I had to uphold it. Sometimes I felt that my whole life had been spent stuck between a rock and a hard place. But then, lots of people had complicated lives. I thought of Eric, a powerful vampire whose mind had been stripped clean of his identity. I thought of the carnage I\u0027d seen in the bridal shop, the white lace and brocade speckled with dried blood and matter. I thought of poor Maria-Star, in the hospital in Shreveport. These witches were bad, and bad should be stopped; bad should be overcome. That\u0027s the American model. It seemed kind of strange to think that I was on the side of vampires and werewolves, and that was the good side. That made me laugh a little, all to myself. Oh, yes, we good guys would save the day.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-to-the-world-sookie-stackhouse-4/page-11.html","bookId":2194,"book":{"id":2194,"title":"Dead to the World (Sookie Stackhouse #4)","description":"Storyline: Dead to the World (Sookie Stackhouse #4) Sookie Stackhouse is a cocktail waitress in Bon Temps, Louisiana. She has only a few close friends, because not everyone appreciates Sookie’s gift: she can read minds. That’s not exactly every man’s idea of date bait – unless they’re undead; vampires and the like can be tough to read. And that’s just the kind of guy Sookie’s been looking for. Maybe that’s why, when she comes across a naked vampire, she doesn’t just drive on by. He hasn’t got a clue who he is, but Sookie has: Eric looks just as scary and sexy – and dead – as ever. But now he has amnesia, he’s sweet, vulnerable, and in need of Sookie’s help – because whoever took his memory now wants his life.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/dead-to-the-world-sookie-stackhouse-4.jpg","author":"Charlaine Harris","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/dead-to-the-world-sookie-stackhouse-4.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:26 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:55:56 PM"}}
