I wish I had thought of that.\" Diane said dryly, \"You will.\" \"What are you going to do now?\" \"Get out of Manhattan.\" \"How?\" Kelly asked. \"They\u0027re going to be watching all the train stations-airports, bus stations, car rental-\" Diane thought for a moment. \"We can go to Brooklyn. They won\u0027t be looking there.\" \"Fine,\" Kelly said. \"Go ahead.\" \"What?\" \"I\u0027m not going with you.\" Diane started to say something and then changed her mind. \"Are you sure?\" \"Yes, Mrs. Stevens.\" Diane said, \"Well, then, we?Good-bye.\" \"Good-bye.\" Kelly watched as Diane hailed a taxi and started to enter it. Kelly stood there, hesitant, trying to make a decision. She was standing alone on an unfamiliar street, with nowhere to go, and no one to go to.\\n\\n The taxi door closed, and the cab started to move.\\n\\n \"Wait!\" Kelly shouted.\\n\\n The taxi stopped. Kelly hurried up to it.\\n\\n Diane opened the door, and Kelly stepped in and settled back in her seat.\\n\\n \"What made you change your mind?\" \"I just realized I\u0027ve never seen Brooklyn.\" Diane looked at Kelly a moment and shook her head.\\n\\n The driver asked, \"Where to?\" \"Take us to Brooklyn, please,\" Diane said.\\n\\n The taxi started. \"Anyplace special?\"\\n\\n \"Just drive around.\" Kelly looked at Diane incredulously. \"You don\u0027t know where we\u0027re going?\" \"I\u0027ll know when we get there.\" Why did I come back? Kelly was asking herself.\\n\\n During the ride, the two of them sat silent, side by side. In twenty minutes, they were crossing the Brooklyn Bridge.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re looking for a hotel,\" Diane told the driver. \"I\u0027m not sure which-\" \"You want a nice hotel, lady? I know just the one. It\u0027s called the Adams. You\u0027ll like it.\"\\n\\n THE ADAMS HOTEL was a five-story brick building with a canopy in front and a doorman in attendance.\\n\\n When the taxi pulled up at the curb, the driver asked, \"Does this look okay?\" Diane said, \"This looks fine.\" Kelly said nothing.\\n\\n They got out of the taxi, and the doorman greeted them. \"Good day, ladies. Are you checking in?\" Diane nodded. \"Yes.\" \"Do you have luggage?\" Diane said glibly, \"The airline lost our bags. Is there anyplace around here where we can shop and pick up some clothes?\" \"There\u0027s a very nice ladies\u0027 shop at the end of the block. Perhaps you would like to check in here first. Then we can have your things sent directly to your room.\" \"Fine. Are you sure they\u0027ll have a room for us here?\" \"This time of the year, there\u0027s no problem.\"\\n\\n THE CLERK BEHIND the hotel desk proffered registration forms. As Kelly signed hers, she said aloud, \"Emily Bronte.\" Diane glanced at the clerk to see if there was any recognition on his face.\\n\\n Nothing.\\n\\n Diane wrote: Mary Cassatt.\\n\\n The clerk took their registration cards. \"And do you wish to pay by credit card?\" \"Yes, we-\" \"No,\" Diane interrupted quickly.\\n\\n Kelly looked at her and reluctantly nodded.\\n\\n \"Luggage?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s coming. We\u0027ll be back.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll have suite 515.\" The clerk watched them walk out the door. Two real beauties. And alone. What a waste.\\n\\n THE FOR MADAME shop was a cornucopia. There were women\u0027s clothes of every description, and a leather section with handbags and suitcases.\\n\\n Kelly looked around and said, \"It looks like we\u0027ve lucked out.\" A saleslady walked up to them. \"May I help you?\" \"We\u0027re just browsing,\" Diane told her.\\n\\n The saleslady watched as they started walking through the store.\\n\\n \"Look!\" said Kelly. \"Stockings.\" She grabbed half a dozen pairs. Diane followed suit.\\n\\n \"Panty hose? Bras, blips.\\n\\n Soon their arms were laden with lingerie.\\n\\n The saleslady hurried over. \"Let me help you.\" \"Thank you.\" The saleswoman relieved them of their burdens.\\n\\n Diane and Kelly began to move down the aisles.\\n\\n Kelly was examining a rack of slacks. She selected four pairs and turned to Diane. \"No telling when we\u0027re going to be able to shop again.\" Diane picked out some slacks and a striped summer dress.\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t wear that,\" Kelly said. \"Stripes will make you look fat.\" Diane started to put it back, then looked at Kelly and handed the dress to the saleslady. \"I\u0027ll take this.\"\\n\\n THE SALESWOMAN WATCHED in amazement as Kelly and Diane went through the rest of the racks. By the time they had finished, their selections filled four suitcases.\\n\\n Kelly looked at them and grinned. \"That should hold us for a while.\" When they went to the cashier, she asked, \"Will that be cash or credit card?\" \"Credit-\" \"Cash,\" Diane said.\\n\\n Kelly and Diane opened their purses and divided the bill. They both had the same thought: Cash is running low.\\n\\n Kelly said to the cashier, \"We\u0027re staying at the Adams. I wonder if you could-\" \"Have your things delivered? Certainly. Your names?\" Kelly hesitated a moment. \"Charlotte Bronte.\" Diane looked at her and said quickly, \"Emily. Emily Bronte.\" Kelly remembered. \"Right.\" The cashier was watching them, a confused expression on her face. She turned to Diane. \"And your name?\" \"I-er-\" Diane\u0027s mind was spinning. What name had she signed? Georgia O\u0027Keeffe.\\n\\n .. Frida\\n\\n Kahlo?Joan Mitchell?\\n\\n \"Her name is Mary Cassatt,\" Kelly said.\\n\\n The cashier swallowed. \"Of course.\"\\n\\n NEXT TO THE For Madame shop was a drugstore. \"We\u0027re in luck again.\" Diane smiled.\\n\\n They hurried inside and began a second shopping spree.\\n\\n \"Mascara.\"\\n\\n \"Blush.\"\\n\\n \"Toothbrushes.\"\\n\\n \"Toothpaste.\"\\n\\n \"Tampons and panty liners.\"\\n\\n \"Lipstick.\"\\n\\n \"Hair clips.\"\\n\\n \"Powder.\"\\n\\n BY THE TIME Diane and Kelly arrived back at their hotel, the four suitcases had already been delivered to their room.\\n\\n Kelly stared at them. \"I wonder which are yours and which are mine?\u0027 \"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" Diane assured her. \"We\u0027re going to be here for maybe a week or more, so we might as well just put everything away.\" \"I suppose so.\" They began busily hanging up dresses and slacks, putting their lingerie in drawers, and placing their toilet articles in the bathroom.\\n\\n When the suitcases were emptied and everything had been put in place, Diane took off her shoes and dress and gratefully sank down on one of the beds.\\n\\n \"This feels wonderful.\" She sighed contentedly. \"I don\u0027t know about you, but I\u0027m having dinner in bed. Then I\u0027m going to take a nice, long, hot bath. I\u0027m not moving from here.\" A pleasant-faced, uniformed maid knocked and came into the suite, carrying an armful of fresh towels.\\n\\n Two minutes later, she emerged from the bathroom. \"If there\u0027s anything you need, please ring for me. Have a good evening.\" \"Thank you.\" Kelly watched her leave.\\n\\n Diane was browsing through a house magazine she had picked up at her bedside.\\n\\n \"Do you know what year this hotel was built?\" \"Get dressed,\" Kelly said. \"We\u0027re leaving.\" \"It was built in-\" \"Get dressed. We\u0027re getting out of here.\" Diane looked up at her. \"Is this some kind of joke?\" \"No. Something terrible is going to happen.\" There was panic in her voice.\\n\\n Diane sat up, alarmed. \"What\u0027s going to happen?\" \"I don\u0027t know. But we have to get out of here, or we\u0027re both going to die.\" Her fear was contagious, but it made no sense.\\n\\n \"Kelly, you\u0027re not being reasonable. If-\" \"I\u0027m begging you, Diane.\" Thinking about it later, Diane never knew whether she gave in because of the urgency in Kelly\u0027s voice or because it was the first time Kelly had called her Diane.\\n\\n \"All right.\" Diane got up. \"We\u0027ll pack our clothes and-\" \"No! Leave everything.\" Diane looked at Kelly in disbelief. \"Leave everything? We just bought-\" \"Hurry! Now!\" \"All right.\" As Diane was reluctantly dressing, she thought, I hope she knows what she\u0027s doing. If\"Quick!\" It was a strangled scream.\\n\\n Diane hurriedly finished dressing.\\n\\n \"Faster!\" They grabbed their purses and hurried out the door.\\n\\n I must be as crazy as she is, Diane thought resentfully.\\n\\n When they reached the lobby, Diane found herself running to keep up with Kelly.\\n\\n \"Would you mind telling me where we\u0027re going?\" Outside, Kelly looked around. \"There\u0027s a park across the street from the hotel.\\n\\n I-I need to sit down.\" Exasperated, Diane followed Kelly into the park. They took seats on a bench.\\n\\n Diane said, \"What are we doing?\" At that instant, there was a tremendous explosion inside the hotel, and from where they sat, Diane and Kelly could see windows being blown out of the room they had been occupying, with debris flying through the air.\\n\\n In stunned disbelief, Diane watched what was happening.\\n\\n \"That-that was a bomb\"-terror crept into her voice-\"in our room.\" She turned to Kelly.\\n\\n \"How-how did you know?\"\\n\\n \"The maid.\" Diane looked at her, puzzled. \"What about her?\" Kelly said quietly, \"Hotel maids don\u0027t wear four-hundred-dollar Manolo Blahnik shoes.\" Diane was finding it difficult to breathe. \"How-how could they have found us?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" Kelly said. \"But remember who we\u0027re dealing with.\" They both sat there, filled with dread.\\n\\n \"Did Tanner Kingsley give you anything when you were in his office?\" Diane asked.\\n\\n Kelly shook her head. \"No. Did he give you anything?\" \"No.\" They realized it at the same instant.\\n\\n \"His card!\" They opened their purses and took out the business cards Tanner Kingsley had given them.\\n\\n Diane tried to break hers in half. It would not bend. \"There\u0027s some kind of chip inside,\" she said, furious.\\n\\n Kelly tried to bend her card. \"In mine, too. That\u0027s how the bastards have been tracking us.\" Diane took Kelly\u0027s card and said angrily, \"Not anymore.\" Kelly watched as Diane stepped out onto the road and threw the cards down on the street. Within minutes, they had been run over by a dozen cars and trucks.\\n\\n In the distance, the sounds of approaching sirens were filling the air.\\n\\n Kelly stood up. \"We\u0027d better get away from here, Diane. Now that they can\u0027t track us anymore, we\u0027ll be all right. I\u0027m going back to Paris. What will you do?\" \"Try to figure out why this is happening.\" \"Be careful.\" \"You, too.\" Diane hesitated a moment. \"Kelly-thanks. You saved my life.\" Embarrassed, Kelly said, \"I feel bad about something. I lied to you.\\n\\n \"You did?\" \"You know what I said about your painting?\" \"Yes.\" \"I really liked it-a lot. You\u0027re good.\" Diane smiled. \"Thanks. I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ve been pretty rude to you.\" \"Diane?\" \"Yes?\" \"I never grew up with maids.\" Diane laughed, and the two of them embraced.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad we met,\" Diane said warmly. So am I.\\n\\n They stood there, looking at each other, finding it difficult to say good-bye.\\n\\n \"I have an idea,\" Diane said. \"If you need me, here\u0027s my cell phone number.\" She wrote it on a piece of paper.\\n\\n \"Here\u0027s mine,\" Kelly replied, and gave it to Diane.\\n\\n \"Well, good-bye again.\" Diane said haltingly, \"Yeah. I?Good-bye, Kelly.\" Diane watched Kelly walk away. At the corner, she turned and waved. Diane waved back. As Kelly disappeared, Diane looked up at the blackened hole that was to have been their tomb, and she felt a chill. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark/page-29.html","bookId":2370,"book":{"id":2370,"title":"Are You Afraid of the Dark?","description":"Storyline: The new novel that Sidney Sheldon\u0027s millions of fans all over the world have been waiting for.
