Pauline and Tanner were snuggled together on a couch in the main cabin.\n Pauline said, \"Darling, do you know it\u0027s a shame that people will never know how brilliant you are?\" \"If they ever found out, I\u0027d be in big trouble.\" She looked at him and said, \"No problem. We could buy a country and proclaim ourselves the rulers. Then they can\u0027t touch us.\" Tanner laughed.\n Pauline stroked his hand. \"Did you know that I wanted you from the first time I saw you?\" \"No. As I remember, you were very impertinent.\" \"And it worked, didn\u0027t it? You had to see me again, to teach me a lesson.\" There was a long, erotic kiss.\n Far away, lightning flashed.\n Tanner said, \"You\u0027ll love Tamoa. We\u0027ll spend a week or two there and relax, and then we\u0027ll travel around the world. We\u0027re going to make up for all the lost years when we couldn\u0027t be together.\" She looked up and grinned impishly. \"You bet we will.\" \"And every month or so, we\u0027ll come back to Tamoa and put Prima II to work. You and I can pick our targets together.\" Pauline said, \"Well, we could create a storm in England, but they wouldn\u0027t notice.\" Tanner laughed. \"We have the whole world to choose from.\" A steward approached. \"Is there anything I can get you?\" he asked.\n Tanner said, \"No. We have everything.\" And he knew that it was true.\n In the distant sky, there were more flashes of lightning.\n \"I hope there isn\u0027t going to be a storm,\" Pauline said. \"I-I hate flying in rough weather.\" Tanner said reassuringly, \"Don\u0027t worry, darling. There\u0027s not a cloud in the sky.\" He thought of something and smiled. \"We don\u0027t have to worry about the weather. We control it.\" He looked at his watch. \"Prima\u0027s about to blow up.\" Sudden drops of rain began to pound against the plane.\n Tanner held Pauline closer. \"It\u0027s all right. It\u0027s just a bit of rain.\" And as Tanner said it, the sky suddenly began to darken and tremble with loud peals of thunder. The huge plane started to bounce up and down. Tanner was looking out the window, puzzled by what was happening. The rain began to turn into large hailstones.\n Tanner said, \"Look at-\" The realization suddenly hit him. \"Prima!\" It was a cry of exultation, a look of glory in his eyes. \"We can-\" At that instant, a hurricane hit the plane, bouncing it around savagely.\n Pauline was screaming.\n IN THE REDBRICK building at KIG, Andrew Kingsley was operating Prima, his fingers flashing over the keys in remembrance. Watching his target on the screen, he could see an image of his brother\u0027s plane being buffeted by three-hundred-mile-an-hour hurricane winds. He pressed another button.\n AT A DOZEN branch offices of the National Weather Service, from Anchorage, Alaska, to Miami, Florida, meteorologists were staring at their computer screens in disbelief. What was happening seemed impossible, but it was happening.\n WORKING IN THE redbrick building, Andrew was grateful that there was still one thing he could do to help make the world a better place. He carefully guided an F-6 tornado he had created-up?up-higher and higher?\n TANNER WAS LOOKING out the window of the wildly tossing plane when he heard the telltale freight train sound of the approaching tornado over the roar of the storm, traveling 320 miles an hour. Tanner\u0027s face was flushed, and he was trembling with excitement, watching the tornado spinning up toward the plane. He was ecstatic. \"Look! There\u0027s never been a tornado this high. Never! I created it!\n It\u0027s a miracle! Only God and I could-\"\n IN THE REDBRICK building, Andrew moved a switch and watched the screen as the plane exploded and pieces of wreckage and bodies were hurled into the sky.\n Then Andrew Kingsley pressed the red button three times. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark/page-46.html","bookId":2370,"book":{"id":2370,"title":"Are You Afraid of the Dark?","description":"Storyline: \n The new novel that Sidney Sheldon\u0027s millions of fans all over the world have been waiting for.
