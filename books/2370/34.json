I\u0027ll get it. And we\u0027ll need some money.\"\\n\\n WHEN THEY ENTERED the bank, Diane went downstairs to the vault and opened her safetydeposit box. She removed her passport, put it in her purse, and walked back upstairs to a teller\u0027s desk.\\n\\n \"I would like to close my account.\"\\n\\n \"Certainly. Your name, please?\"\\n\\n \"Diane Stevens.\" The teller nodded. \"Just a moment, please.\" He walked back to a row of filing cabinets, opened a drawer, and started riffling through the cards. He pulled one out, looked at it a moment, then walked back to Diane. \"Your account has already been closed out, Mrs. Stevens.\" Diane shook her head. \"No. There must be some mistake. I have-\" The teller put the card in front of Diane. It read \"Account closed. Reason:\\n\\n Deceased.\" Diane stared at it unbelievingly, then looked up at the teller. \"Do I look like I\u0027m deceased?\" \"Of course not. I\u0027m sorry. If you\u0027d like me to call the manager, can\"No!\" She suddenly realized what had happened and felt a small shiver. \"No, thanks.\" Diane hurried over to the entrance, where Kelly was waiting.\\n\\n \"Did you get the passport and money?\" \"I got the passport. The bastards closed my bank account.\" \"How could they-?\" \"It\u0027s very simple. They\u0027re KIG and we\u0027re not.\" Diane was thoughtful for a moment. \"Oh, my God.\" \"What now?\" \"I have to make a quick phone call.\" Diane hurried over to a telephone cubicle, dialed a number, and pulled out a credit card. A few moments later, she was speaking to a clerk. \"The account is under the name of Diane Stevens. It\u0027s a valid-\" \"I\u0027m sorry, Mrs. Stevens. Our records show that your card has been reported stolen. If you want to make out a report, we can issue a new card to you in a day or two and-\" Diane said, \"Never mind.\" She slammed down the receiver and walked back to Kelly. \"They\u0027ve canceled my credit cards.\" Kelly took a deep breath. \"Now I\u0027d better make a call or two.\" Kelly was on the telephone for almost half an hour. When she came back to Diane, she was furious.\\n\\n \"The octopus strikes again. But I still have a bank account in Paris, so I can-\" \"We don\u0027t have time for that, Kelly. We have to get out of here now. How much money do you have with you?\" \"Enough to get us back to Brooklyn. What about you?\" \"I could get us to New Jersey.\" \"Then we\u0027re trapped. You know why they\u0027re doing this, don\u0027t you? To keep us from going to Europe and finding out the truth.\" \"It looks like they\u0027ve succeeded.\" Kelly said thoughtfully, \"No, they haven\u0027t. We\u0027re going.\" Diane said skeptically, \"How? My spaceship?\" \"Mine.\"\\n\\n JOSEPH BERRY, THE manager of the Fifth Avenue jewelry store, watched Kelly and Diane approach and gave them his best professional smile. \"May I help you?\" Kelly said, \"Yes. I\u0027d like to sell my ring. It-\" His smile faded. \"I\u0027m sorry. We don\u0027t buy jewelry.\" \"Oh. That\u0027s too bad.\" Joseph Berry started to turn away. Kelly opened her hand. In it was a large emerald ring.\\n\\n \"This is a seven-carat emerald surrounded by three carats of diamonds, set in platinum.\" Joseph Berry stared at the ring, impressed. He picked up a jeweler\u0027s loupe and put it to his eye.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s really beautiful, but we have a firm rule here that-\" \"I want twenty thousand dollars for it.\" \"Did you say twenty thousand dollars?\" \"Yes, in cash.\" Diane was staring at her. \"Kelly-\" Berry looked at the ring again and nodded. \"I-er-think we can arrange that. Just a moment.\" He disappeared into the back office.\\n\\n Diane said, \"Are you crazy? You\u0027re being robbed!\" \"Am I? If we stay here, we\u0027ll be killed. Tell me how much our lives are worth.\" Diane had no answer.\\n\\n Joseph Berry came out of the back office, smiling. \"I\u0027ll have someone go across the street to the bank and get the cash for you right away.\" Diane turned to Kelly. \"I wish you wouldn\u0027t do this.\" Kelly shrugged. \"It\u0027s only a piece of jewelry? She closed her eyes.\\n\\n IT\u0027S ONLY A piece of jewelry?\\n\\n It was her birthday. The phone rang.\\n\\n \"Good morning, darling.\" It was Mark.\\n\\n \"Good morning.\" She waited for him to say \"Happy birthday.\" Instead he said, \"You\u0027re not working today. Do you like hiking?\" That was not what Kelly had expected to hear. She felt a sharp sense of disappointment. They had talked about birthdays a week earlier. Mark had forgotten. Yes.\\n\\n \"How would you like to go for a hike this morning?\" \"All right.\" \"I\u0027ll pick you up in half an hour.\" \"I\u0027ll be ready.\"\\n\\n \"WHERE ARE WE going?\" Kelly asked, when they were in the car. They were both dressed in hiking outfits. \"There are some wonderful trails outside of Fontainebleau.\" \"Oh? Do you go there often?\" \"I used to go there when I wanted to escape.\" Kelly looked at him, puzzled. \"Escape from what?\" He hesitated. \"Loneliness. I felt less lonely there.\" He glanced at Kelly and smiled. \"I haven\u0027t been there since I met you.\"\\n\\n FONTAINEBLEAU IS A magnificent royal palace, surrounded by sylvan forests, located southeast of Paris.\\n\\n As the beautiful, regal estate loomed up in the distance, Mark said, \"A lot of kings named Louis have lived here, starting with Louis IV.\" \"Oh, really?\" Kelly looked at him and thought, I wonder if they had birthday cards in those days.\\n\\n I wish he had given me a birthday card. I\u0027m acting like a schoolgirl.\\n\\n They had reached the palace grounds. Mark pulled into one of the parking lots.\\n\\n As they got out of the car and headed for the woods, Mark said, \"Can you handle a mile?\" Kelly laughed. \"I handle more than that every day on the runway.\" Mark took her hand. \"Good. Let\u0027s go.\" \"I\u0027m with you.\" They passed a series of majestic buildings and started into the woodland. They were completely alone, wrapped in a greenery of ancient fields and storied old trees. It was a sun-kissed summer day filled with itself. The wind was warm and caressing, and there was a cloudless sky above.\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t this beautiful?\" Mark asked.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s lovely, Mark.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad you were free.\" Kelly remembered something. \"Aren\u0027t you supposed to be working today?\" \"I decided to take the day off.\" \"Oh.\" They were walking deeper and deeper into the mysterious forest.\\n\\n After fifteen minutes, Kelly asked, \"How far do you want to go?\" \"There\u0027s a spot up ahead that I like. We\u0027re almost there.\" A few minutes later, they emerged into a glade with an enormous oak tree in the center.\\n\\n \"Here we are,\" Mark said.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s so peaceful.\" There seemed to be something lightly carved on the tree. Kelly went up to it. It read HAPPY BIRTHDAY, KELLY.\\n\\n She stared at Mark a moment, speechless. \"Oh, Mark, darling. Thank you.\" So he had not forgotten.\\n\\n \"I think there might be something in the tree.\" \"In the tree?\" Kelly moved closer to it. There was a hollow place at eye level.\\n\\n She put her hand inside and felt a small package, and pulled it out. It was a gift box. \"What-?\" Open it.\\n\\n Kelly opened it and her eyes widened. In the box was a seven-carat emerald ring, surrounded by three carats of diamonds, set in platinum. Kelly stared at it, unbelievingly. She turned and threw her arms around Mark. \"This is much too generous.\" \"I would give you the moon if you asked for it. Kelly, I\u0027m in love with you.\" She held him close, lost in a euphoria she had never known. And then she said something that she thought she would never, ever say. \"I\u0027m in love with you, darling.\" He was beaming. \"Let\u0027s get married right away. We-\" \"No.\" It was like a whiplash.\\n\\n Mark was looking at her in surprise. \"Why?\" \"We can\u0027t.\" \"Kelly-don\u0027t you believe that I\u0027m in love with you?\" \"Yes.\" \"Are you in love with me?\" \"Yes.\" \"But you don\u0027t want to marry me?\" \"I do want to-but I-I can\u0027t.\" \"I don\u0027t understand. What is it?\" He was studying her, confused. And Kelly knew that the moment she told Mark about the traumatic experience she had had, he would never want to see her again. \"I-I could never be a real wife to you.\" \"What do you mean?\" This was the most difficult thing Kelly had ever had to say. \"Mark, we could never have sex together. When I was eight years old, I was raped.\" She was looking out at the uncaring trees, telling her sordid story to the first man she had ever loved. \"I\u0027m not interested in sex. I\u0027m disgusted by the idea of it. It frightens me. I\u0027m?I\u0027m half a woman. I\u0027m a freak.\" She was breathing hard, trying not to cry.\\n\\n Kelly felt Mark\u0027s hand on hers. \"I\u0027m so sorry, Kelly. That must have been devastating.\" Kelly was silent.\\n\\n \"Sex is very important in a marriage,\" Mark said.\\n\\n Kelly nodded, biting her lip. She knew what he was going to say next. \"Of course. So I understand why you wouldn\u0027t want to-\" \"But that\u0027s not what marriage is about. Marriage is about spending your life with someone you love-having someone to talk to, someone to share all the good times and the bad times.\" She was listening, stunned, afraid to believe what she was hearing.\\n\\n \"Sex finally goes away, Kelly, but real love doesn\u0027t. I love you for your heart and your soul. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I can do without the sex.\" Kelly tried to keep her voice steady. \"No, Mark-I can\u0027t let you.\" \"Why?\" \"Because one day you would regret it. You\u0027d fall in love with someone else who could give you?what I can\u0027t, and you would leave me?and that would break my heart.\" Mark reached out and took Kelly in his arms and held her close. \"Do you know why I could never leave you? Because you\u0027re the best part of me. We\u0027re getting married.\" Kelly looked into his eyes. \"Mark-do you realize what you\u0027re getting into?\" Mark smiled and said, \"I think you might rephrase that.\" Kelly laughed and hugged him. \"Oh, baby, are you sure you-?\" He was beaming. \"I\u0027m sure. What do you say?\" She felt the tears on her cheeks. \"I say?yes.\" Mark slipped the emerald ring on her finger. They held each other for a long time.\\n\\n Kelly said, \"I want you to take me to the salon tomorrow morning and meet some of the models I work with.\" \"I thought there was a rule against-\" \"The rules have been changed.\" Mark was beaming. \"I\u0027ll arrange for a judge I know to marry us Sunday.\"\\n\\n THE NEXT MORNING, when Kelly and Mark arrived at the salon, Kelly pointed up to the sky.\\n\\n \"It looks like it\u0027s going to rain. Everyone talks about the weather, but no one does anything about it.\" Mark turned and gave her a strange look.\\n\\n Kelly saw the expression on Mark\u0027s face. \"Oh, I\u0027m sorry. That\u0027s a cliche, isn\u0027t it?\" Mark did not answer.\\n\\n THERE WERE half a dozen models in the dressing room when Kelly walked in.\\n\\n \"I have an announcement to make. I\u0027m getting married Sunday, and you\u0027re all invited.\" The room was instantly filled with chatter.\\n\\n \"Is this the mysterious beau you wouldn\u0027t let us meet?\" \"Do we know him?\" \"What does he look like?\" Kelly said proudly, \"Like a young Cary Grant.\" \"Ooh! When can we meet him?\" \"Now. He\u0027s here.\" Kelly opened the door wide. \"Come in, darling.\" Mark stepped into the room, and the room became instantly quiet. One of the models looked at Mark and said under her breath, \"Is this some kind of joke?\" \"It must be.\" Mark Harris was a foot shorter than Kelly, a plain, ordinary-looking man, with a thinning mop of gray hair.\\n\\n When the first shock was over, the models stepped up to congratulate the soon-to-be bride and groom.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s wonderful news.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re thrilled for you.\" \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll be very happy together.\" When the congratulations were over, Kelly and Mark left. As they were walking down the hall, Mark asked, \"Do you think they liked me?\" Kelly smiled. \"Of course they did. How could anyone not like you?\" She stopped.\\n\\n \"Oh!\"\\n\\n \"What is it?\" \"I\u0027m on the cover of a fashion magazine that just came in. I want you to see it.\\n\\n Be right back.\" Kelly started toward the models\u0027 dressing room. As she reached the door, she heard a voice say,\\n\\n \"Is Kelly really marrying him?\"\\n\\n Kelly stopped and listened.\\n\\n \"She must have gone crazy.\" \"I\u0027ve seen her turn down some of the handsomest men in the world, and the richest. What does she see in him?\" One of the models who had been quiet spoke up. \"It\u0027s very simple,\" she said.\\n\\n \"What is?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll laugh.\" She hesitated.\\n\\n \"Go ahead.\" \"Did you ever hear the phrase \u0027seeing someone through the eyes of love\u0027?\" No one laughed.\\n\\n THE WEDDING TOOK place at the Ministry of Justice, in Paris, and all the models were there as bridesmaids. Outside on the street, there was a large crowd that had heard about the marriage of the model Kelly. The paparazzi were there in full force.\\n\\n Sam Meadows was Mark\u0027s best man. \"Where are you going on your honeymoon?\" Meadows asked.\\n\\n Mark and Kelly looked at each other. They had not even thought about a honeymoon.\\n\\n Mark said, \"Er-\" He picked a place at random. \"Saint Moritz.\" Kelly smiled uneasily. \"Yes. Saint Moritz.\"\\n\\n NEITHER OF them had been to Saint Moritz before, and the view was breathtaking, an endless vista of majestic mountains and lush valleys.\\n\\n Badrutt\u0027s Palace Hotel nested high on a hill. Mark had called ahead for reservations, and when they arrived, the manager welcomed them. \"Good afternoon, Mr. and Mrs. Harris. I have the honeymoon suite all ready for you.\" Mark stalled for a moment. \"Could-could we have twin beds put in the suite?\" The manager asked tonelessly, \"Twin beds?\" \"Er-yes, please.\" \"Why-certainly.\" \"Thank you.\" Mark turned to Kelly. \"There are a lot of interesting things to see here.\" He pulled a list from his pocket. \"The Engadine Museum, the Druid stone, St. Mauritius fountain, the leaning tower?\\n\\n WHEN MARK AND Kelly were alone in their suite, Mark said, \"Darling, I don\u0027t want the situation to make you uncomfortable. We\u0027re just doing this to stop any gossip. We\u0027re going to spend the rest of our lives together. And what we\u0027re going to share is much more important than anything physical. I just want to be with you and I want you to be with me.\" Kelly threw her arms around him and hugged him. \"I-I don\u0027t know what to say.\" Mark smiled. \"You don\u0027t have to say anything.\"\\n\\n THEY HAD DINNER downstairs and then went back to their suite.\\n\\n Twin beds had been put in the master bedroom. \"Should we toss a coin?\" Kelly smiled. \"No, you take whichever one you like.\" When Kelly came out of the bathroom fifteen minutes later, Mark was in bed.\\n\\n Kelly walked over to him and sat on the edge of his bed. \"Mark, are you sure this is going to work for you?\" \"I\u0027ve never been more sure of anything in my life. Good night, my beautiful darling.\" \"Good night.\" Kelly got into her bed and lay there, thinking. Reliving the night that had changed her life. Shhh! Don\u0027t make a sound?If you tell your mother about this, I\u0027ll come back and kill her. What that monster had done to her had taken over her whole life. He had killed something in her, and made her afraid of the dark?afraid of men?afraid of love. She had given him power over her. I\u0027m not going to let him. Not anymore. All the emotions she had repressed over the years, all the passion that had been building up in her, exploded like a dam bursting. Kelly looked over at Mark and suddenly wanted him desperately. She threw back the covers and walked over to his bed. \"Move over,\" she whispered.\\n\\n Mark sat up, surprised. \"You said you-you didn\u0027t want me in your bed, and I-\" Kelly looked at him and said softly, \"But I didn\u0027t say I couldn\u0027t be in your bed.\" She watched the look on his face as she took off her nightgown and slid into bed beside him.\\n\\n \"Make love to me,\" she whispered.\\n\\n \"Oh, Kelly! Yes!\" He started softly and gently. Too softly. Too gently. The floodgates had opened, and Kelly needed him urgently. She made violent love to him, and she had never felt anything so wonderful in her life.\\n\\n When they were lying in each other\u0027s arms, resting, Kelly said, \"You know that list you showed me?\" \"Yes.\" She said softly, \"You can throw it away.\" Mark grinned.\\n\\n \"What a fool I\u0027ve been,\" Kelly said. She held Mark close, and they talked, and made love again, and finally they were both exhausted.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll turn out the lights,\" Mark said.\\n\\n She tensed and squeezed her eyes shut. She started to say no, but as she felt his warm body close to her, protecting her, she said nothing.\\n\\n When Mark turned out the lights, Kelly opened her eyes.\\n\\n Kelly was no longer afraid of the dark. She* * *\\n\\n \"KELLY? KELLY!\"\\n\\n She was jolted out of her reverie. She looked up, and she was back in the Fifth Avenue jewelry shop in New York, and Joseph Berry was holding out a thick envelope to her.\\n\\n \"Here you are. Twenty thousand dollars, in hundred-dollar bills, just as you requested.\" It took Kelly a moment to get her bearings. \"Thank you.\" Kelly opened the envelope, extracted ten thousand dollars, and handed it to Diane.\\n\\n Diane looked at her, puzzled. \"What\u0027s this?\" \"This is your half.\" \"For what? I can\u0027t-\" \"You can pay me back later.\" Kelly shrugged. \"If we\u0027re still around. If we\u0027re not around, I won\u0027t need it anyway. Now let\u0027s see if we can get out of here.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark/page-34.html","bookId":2370,"book":{"id":2370,"title":"Are You Afraid of the Dark?","description":"Storyline: The new novel that Sidney Sheldon\u0027s millions of fans all over the world have been waiting for.
