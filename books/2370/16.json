{"id":69679,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"THE WORLD HEADQUARTERS of Kingsley International Group was located in lower Manhattan, two blocks from the East River. The compound occupied five acres of land and consisted of four large concrete buildings, along with two small staff houses, fenced in and guarded electronically.\\n\\n At ten o\u0027clock in the morning, Detectives Earl Greenburg and Robert Praegitzer entered the lobby of the main building. It was spacious and modern, furnished with couches and tables, and half a dozen chairs.\\n\\n Detective Greenburg glanced at the assortment of magazines on a table: Virtual Reality, Nuclear and Radiological Terrorism, Robotics World?He held up a copy of Genetic Engineering News and turned to Praegitzer. \"Don\u0027t you get tired of reading these in your dentist\u0027s office?\" Praegitzer grinned. \"Yeah.\" The two detectives approached the receptionist and identified themselves. \"We have an appointment with Mr. Tanner Kingsley.\" \"He\u0027s expecting you. I\u0027ll have someone escort you to his office.\" She gave them each a KIG badge. \"Please turn these in when you leave.\" \"No problem.\" The receptionist pressed a buzzer, and a moment later, an attractive young woman appeared.\\n\\n \"These gentlemen have an appointment with Mr. Tanner Kingsley.\" \"Yes. I\u0027m Retra Tyler, one of Mr. Kingsley\u0027s assistants. Follow me, please.\" The two detectives walked down a long, sterile corridor with tightly closed office doors on each side.\\n\\n At the end of the corridor was Tanner\u0027s office.\\n\\n In Tanner\u0027s waiting room, Kathy Ordonez, Tanner\u0027s bright young secretary, was seated behind a desk.\\n\\n \"Good morning, gentlemen. You can go right in.\" She got up and opened the door to Tanner\u0027s private office. As the detectives stepped inside, they stopped to stare, in awe.\\n\\n The huge office was crammed with arcane electronic equipment, and the soundproof walls were lined with wafer-thin television sets displaying live scenes from cities around the world. Some of the views were of busy conference rooms, offices, and laboratories, while others showed hotel suites where meetings were taking place. Each set had its own audio system, and even though the volume was barely audible, it was eerie to hear snippets of sentences spoken simultaneously in a dozen different languages.\\n\\n A caption appeared at the bottom of each screen identifying the cities: Milan.\\n\\n .. Johannesburg?\\n\\n Zurich?Madrid?Athens?At the far wall was an eight-tier bookshelf filled with leather-bound volumes.\\n\\n Tanner Kingsley was seated behind a mahogany desk that contained a console with half a dozen different colored buttons. He was elegantly dressed in a tailored gray suit with a light blue shirt and a blue checked tie.\\n\\n Tanner rose as the two detectives walked in. \"Good morning, gentlemen.\" Earl Greenburg said, \"Good morning. We\u0027re-\" \"Yes, I know who you are. Detectives Earl Greenburg and Robert Praegitzer.\" They shook hands.\\n\\n \"Sit down, please.\"\\n\\n The detectives took seats.\\n\\n Praegitzer was staring at the swiftly changing, worldwide pictures on the profusion of television sets.\\n\\n He shook his head in admiration. \"Talk about today\u0027s state of the art! This is-\" Tanner raised a hand. \"We\u0027re not talking here about today\u0027s state of the art, Detective. This technology won\u0027t be on the market for another two or three years. With these, we\u0027re able to watch teleconferences in a dozen different countries simultaneously. The information that pours in from our offices around the world is automatically categorized and recorded by these computers.\" Praegitzer asked, \"Mr. Kingsley, forgive a simplistic question. What does a think tank do, exactly?\" \"Bottom line? We\u0027re problem solvers. We figure out solutions to problems that may lie ahead. Some think tanks concentrate in only one area-the military or economics or politics.\\n\\n We deal in national security, communications, microbiology, environmental issues. KIG functions as an independent analyst and critic of long-range global consequences for various governments.\" \"Interesting,\" said Praegitzer.\\n\\n \"Eighty-five percent of our research staff hold advanced degrees, and more than sixty-five percent have Ph.D.s.\" \"That\u0027s impressive.\" \"My brother, Andrew, founded this company to assist Third World countries, so we\u0027re also heavily involved in start-up projects there.\" There was a sudden rumble of thunder and a flash of lightning from one of the television sets. They all turned to look.\\n\\n Detective Greenburg said, \"Didn\u0027t I read something about a weather experiment you were doing?\" Tanner grimaced. \"Yes, it\u0027s known around here as Kingsley\u0027s folly. It\u0027s one of the few major failures KIG ever had. It was the one project that I most hoped would work. Instead, we\u0027re closing it down.\" Praegitzer asked, \"Is it possible to control the weather?\" Tanner shook his head. \"Only to a limited degree. A lot of people have tried. As long ago as 1900, Nikola Tesla was doing experiments with weather. He discovered that ionization of the atmosphere could be altered by radio waves. In 1958, our Defense Department experimented with dropping copper needles into the ionosphere. Ten years later, there was Project Popeye, where the government attempted to extend the monsoon season in Laos, to increase the amount of mud in the Ho Chi Minh Trail. They used a silver iodide nuclei agent, and generators shot banks of silver iodide into the clouds, to become seeds for raindrops.\" \"Did it work?\" \"Yes, but on a confined local basis. There are several reasons why no one will ever be able to control the weather. One problem is that El Nino creates warm temperatures in the Pacific Ocean that disrupt the world\u0027s ecological system, while La Nina creates cold weather temperatures in the Pacific, and the two of them combined completely negate any realistic weather control planning.\\n\\n The Southern Hemisphere is about eighty percent ocean, while the Northern Hemisphere is sixty percent ocean, causing another imbalance. In addition to that, the jet stream determines the path of storms, and there is no way to control that.\" Greenburg nodded, then hesitated. \"Do you know why we\u0027re here, Mr. Kingsley?\" Tanner studied Greenburg a moment. \"I trust that that is a rhetorical question.\\n\\n Otherwise, I would find it offensive. Kingsley International Group is a think tank. Four of my employees have died or disappeared mysteriously within a period of twenty-four hours. We have already started our own investigation.\\n\\n We have offices in major cities around the world, with eighteen hundred employees, and it is obviously difficult for me to keep in contact with all of them. But what I have learned so far is that two of the employees who were murdered were apparently involved in illegal activities. It cost them their livesbut I assure you, it is not going to cost Kingsley International Group its reputation. I expect our people to resolve this very quickly.\" Greenburg spoke up. \"Mr. Kingsley, there\u0027s something else. We understand that six years ago a Japanese scientist named Akira Iso committed suicide in Tokyo. Three years ago a Swiss scientist named Madeleine Smith committed suicide in-\" Tanner interrupted. \"Zurich. Neither of them committed suicide. They were murdered.\" The two detectives looked at him in surprise. Praegitzer asked, \"How do you know that?\" There was a hardened tone in Tanner\u0027s voice. \"They were killed because of me.\" \"When you say-\" \"Akira Iso was a brilliant scientist. He worked for a Japanese electronics conglomerate called Tokyo First Industrial. I met Iso at an international industry convention in Tokyo. We got along well. I felt that KIG could offer him a better atmosphere than the company he was with. I made him an offer to work here, and he accepted. In fact, he was very excited about it.\" Tanner was fighting to keep his voice steady. \"We agreed to keep it confidential until he was legally able to leave that company. But he obviously mentioned it to someone, because there was an item about it in a newspaper column, and? Tanner stopped again for a long moment, then went on. \"The day after the item appeared, Iso was found dead in a hotel room.\" Robert Praegitzer asked, \"Mr. Kingsley, couldn\u0027t there have been other reasons that might explain his death?\" Tanner shook his head. \"No. I didn\u0027t believe he committed suicide. I hired investigators and sent them and some of my own people to Japan to try to learn what had happened. They couldn\u0027t find any evidence of foul play, and I thought that perhaps I was wrong, that possibly there was some tragedy in Iso\u0027s life that I knew nothing about.\" \"Then why are you so sure now that he was murdered?\" Green-burg wanted to know.\\n\\n \"As you mentioned, a scientist named Madeleine Smith supposedly committed suicide in Zurich, three years ago. What you don\u0027t know is that Madeleine Smith also wanted to leave the people she worked for and come to our company.\" Greenburg frowned. \"What makes you think the two deaths are connected?\" Tanner\u0027s face was stone. \"Because the company she worked for is a branch of the same Tokyo First Industrial.\" There was a stunned silence.\\n\\n Praegitzer said, \"There\u0027s something I don\u0027t understand. Why would they murder an employee just because she wants to quit? If-\" \"Madeleine Smith wasn\u0027t just an employee. Neither was Iso. They were brilliant physicists who were about to solve problems that would have made the company a fortune larger than you can imagine.\\n\\n That\u0027s why they didn\u0027t want to lose either of them to us.\" \"Did the Swiss police investigate Smith\u0027s death?\" \"Yes. So did we. But again, we could prove nothing. As a matter of fact, we\u0027re still working on all the deaths that occurred, and I expect that we will solve them. KIG has far-reaching connections all over the world. If I get any useful information, I will be happy to share it with you. I hope you will reciprocate.\" Greenburg said, \"That\u0027s fair enough.\" A gold-plated phone on Tanner\u0027s desk rang. \"Excuse me.\" He walked over to the desk and picked up the phone. \"Hello?Yes?The investigation\u0027s coming along very satisfactorily. As a matter of fact, two detectives are in my office at this moment, and they have agreed to cooperate with us.\" He glanced over at Praegitzer and Greenburg. \"Right?I\u0027ll let you know when we have any further news.\" He replaced the receiver.\\n\\n Greenburg asked, \"Mr. Kingsley, are you working on anything sensitive here?\" \"You mean are we working on something sensitive enough to have half a dozen people murdered? Detective Greenburg, there are more than a hundred think tanks around the world, some of them working on exactly the same problems we are. We\u0027re not building atomic bombs here. The answer to your question is no.\" The door opened, and Andrew Kingsley walked into the office carrying a stack of papers. Andrew Kingsley bore little resemblance to his brother. His features seemed to be blurred. He had thinning gray hair, a lined face, and he walked in a slightly stooped posture. Whereas Tanner Kingsley was brimming with vitality and intelligence, Andrew Kingsley appeared to be slow-witted and apathetic. He spoke haltingly and seemed to have trouble putting sentences together.\\n\\n \"Here are those-you know-those notes you asked for, Tanner. I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t finish-finish them earlier.\" \"That\u0027s perfectly all right, Andrew.\" Tanner turned to the two detectives. \"This is my brother, Andrew. Detectives Greenburg and Praegitzer.\" Andrew looked at them uncertainly and blinked.\\n\\n \"Andrew, do you want to tell them about your Nobel Prize?\" Andrew looked at Tanner and said vaguely, \"Yes, the Nobel Prize?the Nobel Prize? They watched as he turned and shuffled out of the room.\\n\\n Tanner sighed. \"As I mentioned, Andrew was the founder of this company, a truly brilliant man. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for one of his discoveries seven years ago.\\n\\n Unfortunately, he became involved in an experiment that went wrong and it-it changed him.\" His tone was bitter.\\n\\n \"He must have been a remarkable man.\"\\n\\n \"You have no idea.\" Earl Greenburg rose and held out his hand. \"Well, we won\u0027t take up any more of your time, Mr. Kingsley. We\u0027ll keep in touch.\" \"Gentlemen-\" Tanner\u0027s voice was steel. \"Let\u0027s get these crimes solved-fast.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark/page-16.html","bookId":2370,"book":{"id":2370,"title":"Are You Afraid of the Dark?","description":"Storyline: The new novel that Sidney Sheldon\u0027s millions of fans all over the world have been waiting for.
