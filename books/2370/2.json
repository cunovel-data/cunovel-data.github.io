{"id":69665,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"IN DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN, in courtroom thirty-seven of the Supreme Court Criminal Term building at 180 Centre Street, the trial of Anthony (Tony) Altieri was in session. The large, venerable courtroom was filled to capacity with press and spectators.\n At the defendant\u0027s table sat Anthony Altieri, slouched in a wheelchair, looking like a pale, fat frog folding in on itself. Only his eyes were alive, and every time he looked at Diane Stevens in the witness chair, she could literally feel the pulse of his hatred.\n Next to Altieri sat Jake Rubenstein, Altieri\u0027s defense attorney. Rubenstein was famous for two things: his high-profile clientele, consisting mostly of mobsters, and the fact that nearly all of his clients were acquitted.\n Rubenstein was a small, dapper man with a quick mind and a vivid imagination. He was never the same in his courtroom appearances. Courtroom histrionics were his stock-in-trade, and he was highly skilled. He was brilliant at sizing up his opponents, with a feral instinct for finding their weaknesses. Sometimes Rubenstein imagined he was a lion, slowly closing in on his unsuspecting prey, ready to pounce?or a cunning spider, spinning a web that would eventually entrap them and leave them helpless?Sometimes he was a patient fisherman, gently tossing a line into the water and slowly moving it back and forth until the gullible witness took the bait.\n The lawyer was carefully studying the witness on the stand. Diane Stevens was in her early thirties.\n An aura of elegance. Patrician features. Soft, flowing blonde hair. Green eyes.\n Lovely figure. A girl-next-door kind of wholesomeness. She was dressed in a chic, tailored black suit. Jake Rubenstein knew that the day before she had made a favorable impression on the jury. He had to be careful how he handled her. Fisherman, he decided.\n Rubenstein took his time approaching the witness box, and when he spoke, his voice was gentle.\n \"Mrs. Stevens, yesterday you testified that on the date in question, October fourteenth, you were driving south on the Henry Hudson Parkway when you got a flat tire and pulled off the highway at the One Hundred and Fifty-eighth Street exit, onto a service road into Fort Washington Park?\" \"Yes.\" Her voice was soft and cultured.\n \"What made you stop at that particular place?\" \"Because of the flat tire, I knew I had to get off the main road and I could see the roof of a cabin through the trees. I thought there might be someone there who could help me. I didn\u0027t have a spare.\" \"Do you belong to an auto club?\" Yes.\n \"And do you have a phone in your car?\" Yes.\n \"Then why didn\u0027t you call the auto club?\" \"I thought that might have taken too long.\" Rubenstein said sympathetically, \"Of course. And the cabin was right there.\" \"Yes.\" \"So, you approached the cabin to get help?\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"Was it still light outside?\" \"Yes. It was about five o\u0027clock in the afternoon.\" \"And so, you could see clearly?\" \"I could.\" \"What did you see, Mrs. Stevens?\" \"I saw Anthony Altieri-\" \"Oh. You had met him before?\" \"No.\" \"What made you sure it was Anthony Altieri?\" \"I had seen his picture in the newspaper and-\" \"So, you had seen pictures that resembled the defendant?\" \"Well, it-\" \"What did you see in that cabin?\" Diane Stevens took a shuddering breath. She spoke slowly, visualizing the scene in her mind.\n \"There were four men in the room. One a of them was in a chair, tied up. Mr. Altieri seemed to be questioning him while the two other men stood next to him.\" Her voice shook. \"Mr. Altieri pulled out a gun, yelled something, and-and shot the man in the back of the head.\" Jake Rubenstein cast a sidelong glance at the jury. They were absorbed in her testimony.\n \"What did you do then, Mrs. Stevens?\" \"I ran back to my car and dialed 911 on my cell phone.\" \"And then?\" \"I drove away.\" \"With a flat tire?\" \"Yes.\n Time for a little ripple in the water. \"Why didn\u0027t you wait for the police?\" Diane glanced toward the defense table. Altieri was watching her with naked malevolence.\n She looked away. \"I couldn\u0027t stay there because I-I was afraid that the men might come out of the cabin and see me.\" \"That\u0027s very understandable.\" Rubenstein\u0027s voice hardened. \"What is not understandable is that when the police responded to your 911 call, they went into the cabin, and not only was no one there, Mrs. Stevens, but they could find no sign that anyone had been there, let alone been murdered there.\" \"I can\u0027t help that. I-\" \"You\u0027re an artist, aren\u0027t you?\" She was taken aback by the question. \"Yes, I-\" \"Are you successful?\" \"I suppose so, but what does-?\" It was time to yank the hook.\n \"A little extra publicity never hurts, does it? The whole country watches you on the nightly news report on television, and on the front pages of-\" Diane looked at him, furious. \"I didn\u0027t do this for publicity. I would never send an innocent man to-\" \"The key word is innocent, Mrs. Stevens. And I will prove to you and the ladies and gentlemen of the jury that Mr. Altieri is innocent. Thank you. You\u0027re finished.\" Diane Stevens ignored the double entendre. When she stepped down to return to her seat, she was seething. She whispered to the prosecuting attorney, \"Am I free to go?\" \"Yes. I\u0027ll send someone with you.\" \"That won\u0027t be necessary. Thank you.\" She headed for the door and walked out to the parking garage, the words of the defense attorney ringing in her ears.\n You\u0027re an artist, aren\u0027t you??A little extra publicity never hurts, does it? It was degrading. Still, all in all, she was satisfied with the way her testimony had gone. She had told the jury exactly what she had seen, and they had no reason to doubt her. Anthony Altieri was going to be convicted and sent to prison for the rest of his life. Yet Diane could not help thinking of the venomous looks he had given her, and she felt a little shiver.\n She handed the parking attendant her ticket and he went to get her car.\n Two minutes later, Diane was driving onto the street, heading north, on her way home.\n THERE WAS A stop sign at the corner. As Diane braked to a halt, a well-dressed young man standing at the curb approached the car. \"Excuse me. I\u0027m lost. Could you-?\" Diane lowered her window.\n \"Could you tell me how to get to the Holland Tunnel?\" He spoke with an Italian accent.\n \"Yes. It\u0027s very simple. Go down to the first-\" The man raised his arm, and there was a gun with a silencer in his hand. \"Out of the car, lady. Fast!\" Diane turned pale. \"All right. Please don\u0027t-\" As she started to open the door, the man stepped back, and Diane slammed her foot down on the accelerator and the car sped away. She heard the rear window smash as a bullet went through it, and then a crack as another bullet hit the back of the car.\n Her heart was pounding so hard that it was difficult to breathe.\n Diane Stevens had read about carjackings, but they had always been remote, something that happened to other people. And the man had tried to kill her. Did carjackers do that?\n Diane reached for her cell phone and dialed 911. It took almost two minutes before an operator answered.\n \"Nine one one. What is your emergency?\" Even as Diane was explaining what had happened, she knew it was hopeless. The man would be long gone by now.\n \"I\u0027ll send an officer to the location. May I have your name, address, and phone number?\" Diane gave them to her. Useless, she thought. She glanced back at the shattered window and shuddered. She desperately wanted to call Richard at work and tell him what had happened, but she knew he was working on an urgent project. If she called him and told him what had just occurred, he would get upset and rush to her side-and she did not want him to miss his deadline. She would tell him what happened when he got back to the apartment.\n Suddenly a chilling thought occurred to her. Had the man been waiting for her, or was this just a coincidence? She remembered the conversation she had had with Richard when the trial began:\n I don\u0027t think you should testify, Diane. It could be dangerous.\n Don\u0027t worry, darling. Altieri will be convicted. They\u0027ll lock him away forever.\n But he has friends andRichard, if I didn\u0027t do this, I couldn\u0027t live with myself.\n What just happened had to be a coincidence, Diane decided. Altieri wouldn \u0027t be crazy enough to do anything to me, especially now, during his trial.\n Diane turned off the highway and drove west until she reached her apartment building on East Seventy-fifth Street. Before she pulled into the underground garage, she took a last careful look in the rearview mirror. Everything seemed normal.\n THE APARTMENT WAS an airy, ground-floor duplex, with a spacious living room, floor-to-ceiling windows, and a large, marble fireplace. There were upholstered floral sofas, armchairs, a built-in bookcase, and a large television screen. The walls were rainbowed with colorful paintings. There was a Childe Hassam, a Jules Pascin, a Thomas Birch, a George Hitchcock, and, in one area, a group of Diane\u0027s paintings.\n On the next floor were a master bedroom and bathroom, a second guest bedroom, and a sunny atelier, where Diane painted. Several of her paintings were hanging on the walls. On an easel in the center of the room was a half-finished portrait.\n The first thing Diane did when she arrived home was to hurry into the atelier.\n She removed the half-finished portrait on the easel and replaced it with a blank canvas. She began to sketch the face of the man who had tried to kill her, but her hands were trembling so hard that she had to stop.\n DRIVING TO DIANE STEVEN\u0027S apartment, Detective Earl Greenburg complained, \"This is the part of the job I hate most.\" Robert Praegitzer said, \"It\u0027s better that we tell them than have them hear about it on the evening news.\" He looked at Greenburg. \"You going to tell her?\" Earl Greenburg nodded unhappily. He found himself remembering the story of the detective who had gone to inform a Mrs. Adams, the wife of a patrolman, that her husband had been killed.\n She\u0027s very sensitive, the chief had cautioned the detective. You\u0027ll have to break the news carefully.\n Don\u0027t worry. I can handle it.\n The detective had knocked on the door of the Adams home, and when it was opened by Adams\u0027s wife, the\" detective had asked, Are you the widow Adams?\n DIANE WAS STARTLED by the sound of the doorbell. She went to the intercom. \"Who is it?\" \"Detective Earl Greenburg. I\u0027d like to speak to you, Mrs. Stevens.\" It\u0027s about the carjacking, Diane thought. The police got here fast.\n She pressed the buzzer and Greenburg entered the hallway and walked to her door.\n \"Hello.\"\n \"Mrs. Stevens?\" \"Yes. Thank you for coming so quickly. I started to draw a sketch of the man, but I? She took a deep breath. \"He was swarthy, with deep-set light brown eyes and a little mole on his cheek. His gun had a silencer on it, and-\" Greenburg was looking at her in confusion. \"I\u0027m sorry. I don\u0027t understand what-\" \"The carjacker. I called 911 and-\" She saw the expression on the detective\u0027s face. \"This isn\u0027t about the carjacking, is it?\" \"No, ma\u0027am, it\u0027s not.\" Greenburg paused a moment. \"May I come in?\n \"Please.\"\n Greenburg walked into the apartment.\n She was looking at him, frowning. \"What is it? Is something wrong?\" The words would not seem to come. \"Yes. I\u0027m sorry. I-I\u0027m afraid I have some bad news. It\u0027s about your husband.\" \"What\u0027s happened?\" Her voice was shaky.\n \"He\u0027s had an accident.\" Diane felt a sudden chill. \"What kind of accident?\" Greenburg took a deep breath. \"He was killed last night, Mrs. Stevens. We found his body under a bridge along the East River this morning.\" Diane stared at him for a long moment, then slowly shook her head. \"You have the wrong person, Lieutenant. My husband is at work, in his laboratory.\" This was going to be even more difficult than he had anticipated. \"Mrs. Stevens, did your husband come home last night?\" \"No, but Richard frequently works all night. He\u0027s a scientist.\" She was becoming more and more agitated.\n \"Mrs. Stevens, were you aware that your husband was involved with the Mafia?\" Diane blanched. \"The Mafia? Are you insane?\" \"We found-\" Diane was beginning to hyperventilate. \"Let me see your identification.\" \"Certainly.\" Detective Greenburg pulled out his ID card and showed it to her.\n Diane glanced at it, handed it back, and then slapped Greenburg hard across his face. \"Does the city pay you to go around trying to scare honest citizens? My husband is not dead!\n He\u0027s at work.\" She was shouting.\n Greenburg looked into her eyes and saw the shock and denial there. \"Mrs.\n Stevens, would you like me to send someone over to look after you and-?\" \"You\u0027re the one who needs someone to look after you. Now get out of here.\" \"Mrs. Stevens-\" \"Now!\" Greenburg took out a business card and put it on a table. \"In case you need to talk to me, here\u0027s my number.\" As he walked out the door, Greenburg thought, Well, I handled that brilliantly.\n I might as well have said, \"Are you the widow Stevens?\"\n WHEN DETECTIVE EARL Greenburg left, Diane locked the front door and took a deep, shivering breath. The idiot! Coming to the wrong apartment and trying to scare me. I should report him. She looked at her watch. Richard will be coming home soon. It\u0027s time to start getting dinner ready. She was making paella, his favorite dish. She went into the kitchen and started to prepare it.\n BECAUSE OF THE secrecy of Richard\u0027s work, Diane never disturbed him at the laboratory, and if he did not call her, she knew it was a signal that he was going to be late. At eight o\u0027clock, the paella was ready. She tasted it and smiled, satisfied. It was made just the way Richard liked it. At ten o\u0027clock, when he still had not arrived, Diane put the paella in the refrigerator and stuck a Post-it note on the refrigerator door: Darling, supper is in the fridge. Come and wake me up. Richard would be hungry when he came home.\n Diane felt suddenly drained. She undressed, put on a nightgown, brushed her teeth, and got into bed.\n In a few minutes, she fell sound asleep.\n AT THREE O\u0027CLOCK in the morning, she woke up screaming. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark/page-2.html","bookId":2370,"book":{"id":2370,"title":"Are You Afraid of the Dark?","description":"Storyline: \n The new novel that Sidney Sheldon\u0027s millions of fans all over the world have been waiting for.
