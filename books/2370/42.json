There are half a dozen men in it.\" \"Can you lose them?\" \"I don\u0027t have to.\" Kelly stared at her. \"What?\" \"Watch.\" They were approaching an airport gate with a sign that read deliveries only. The guard behind the gate had opened it to admit the car.\\n\\n The men in the Lexus watched as Kelly and Diane got out and stepped into an official airport car that started across the tarmac.\\n\\n When the Lexus reached the gate, the guard said, \"This is a private entrance.\" \"But you let that other car in.\" \"This is a private entrance.\" The guard closed the gate.\\n\\n THE OFFICIAL AIRPORT car crossed the tarmac and stopped at the side of a jumbo jet. As Diane and Kelly stepped out, Howard Miller was waiting. \"You got here all right.\" \"Yes,\" Diane said. \"Thanks so much for making the arrangements.\" \"My pleasure.\" His face became grim. \"I hope some good comes out of all of this.\" Kelly said, \"Thank Lois Reynolds for us and tell her-\" Howard Miller\u0027s expression changed. \"Lois Reynolds passed away last night.\" The two women both felt a sense of shock. It took Kelly a moment to speak. \"I\u0027m sorry.\" \"What happened?\" Diane asked.\\n\\n \"I guess her heart gave out.\" Howard Miller looked over at the jet. \"They\u0027re ready to go. I\u0027ve arranged seats for you near the door.\" \"Thanks again.\"\\n\\n HOWARD MILLER WATCHED AS Kelly and Diane went up the ramp. Moments later, the flight attendant closed the door, and the plane began to taxi.\\n\\n Kelly turned to Diane and smiled. \"We\u0027ve made it. We outsmarted all those brainiacs. What are you going to do after we talk to Senator Van Luven?\" \"I hadn\u0027t really thought about it,\" Diane said. \"Are you going back to Paris?\" \"It depends. Do you think you\u0027ll be staying in New York?\" \"Yes.\" Kelly said, \"Then maybe I\u0027ll stick around New York for a while.\" \"Then we might go to Paris together.\" They sat there, smiling at each other.\\n\\n Diane said, \"I was just thinking how proud Richard and Mark would be if they knew we\u0027re going to finish the job they started.\" \"You bet.\" Diane looked out the window and up at the sky, and said softly, \"Thank you, Richard.\" Kelly glanced at Diane, shook her head, and said nothing.\\n\\n Richard, I know you can hear me, darling. We\u0027re going to finish what you started. We\u0027re going to avenge you and your friends. It won\u0027t bring you back, but it will help a little.\\n\\n Do you know what I miss most about you, my love? Everything.\\n\\n WHEN THE PLANE landed at La Guardia airport three and a half hours later, Diane and Kelly were the first passengers to disembark. Diane remembered Senator Van Luven\u0027s words:\\n\\n When you get to the airport, a gray Lincoln Town Car will be waiting for you.\\n\\n The car was waiting at the terminal entrance. Standing next to it was an elderly Japanese man in a chauffeur\u0027s uniform. He stood up straight as Kelly and Diane approached him.\\n\\n \"Mrs. Stevens? Mrs. Harris?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" \"I\u0027m Kunio.\" He opened the door of the car and they stepped in.\\n\\n Moments later, they were on their way to Southampton.\\n\\n \"It is a two-hour drive,\" Kunio said. \"The scenery is very beautiful.\" The last thing they were interested in was scenery. Both were busily thinking about the quickest way to explain to the senator what had happened.\\n\\n Kelly said to Diane, \"Do you think the senator will be in danger when we tell her what we know?\" \"I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll have protection. She\u0027ll know how to handle this.\" \"I hope so.\" After almost two hours the Town Car finally drove up to a large limestone mansion with a slate roof and tall, slender chimneys, in the style of eighteenth-century England.\\n\\n There were extensive, manicured grounds, and they could see a separate house for the servant quarters and garage.\\n\\n As the car stopped at the front door, Kunio said, \"I will be waiting for you, if you need me.\" \"Thank you.\" The door was opened by a butler. \"Good morning. Come in, please. The senator is expecting you.\" The two women entered. The living room was elegant yet casual, furnished with an eclectic assortment of antiques and comfortable-looking couches and chairs. On the wall, above a large fireplace with a baroque mantel, were mirrored candle sconces.\\n\\n The butler said, \"This way, please.\" Kelly and Diane followed the butler into a large drawing room.\\n\\n Senator Van Luven was waiting for them. She was wearing a light blue silk suit and blouse, and her hair was hanging loosely. She was more feminine-looking than Diane had expected.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m Pauline Van Luven.\"\\n\\n \"Diane Stevens.\"\\n\\n \"Kelly Harris.\" \"I\u0027m glad to see you both. It\u0027s taken much too long.\" Kelly looked at Senator Van Luven, puzzled. \"I\u0027m sorry?\" Tanner Kingsley\u0027s voice behind them said, \"She means you have been very lucky, but your luck has just run out.\" Diane and Kelly turned. Tanner Kingsley and Harry Flint had come into the room.\\n\\n Tanner said, \"Now, Mr. Flint.\" Harry Flint raised a pistol. Without a word, he aimed at the women and fired twice. Pauline Van Luven and Tanner Kingsley watched as Kelly\u0027s and Diane\u0027s bodies tumbled backward and fell to the floor.\\n\\n Tanner walked over to Senator Van Luven and hugged her. \"It\u0027s finally over, Princess.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark/page-42.html","bookId":2370,"book":{"id":2370,"title":"Are You Afraid of the Dark?","description":"Storyline: The new novel that Sidney Sheldon\u0027s millions of fans all over the world have been waiting for.
