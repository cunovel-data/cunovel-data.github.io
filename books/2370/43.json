We can be on our way.\" She moved up to him and kissed him. \"I\u0027ve missed you so much, baby.\" \"I\u0027ve missed you, too.\" \"Those monthly rendezvous were frustrating because I knew you had to leave.\" Tanner held her close. \"From now on, we\u0027re together. We\u0027ll wait a respectable three or four months as an homage to your dear departed husband and then we\u0027ll get married.\" She smiled and said, \"Lets make it a month.\" He nodded. \"Sounds good.\" \"I resigned from the Senate yesterday. They were very understanding about my grief over my husband\u0027s death.\" \"Wonderful. Now we can be seen together freely. I want you to see something at KIG that I couldn\u0027t show you before.\"\\n\\n TANNER AND PAULINE had reached the redbrick building. Tanner walked up to the solid steel door. There was a recess in the center of it. He was wearing a heavy cameo ring with the face of a Greek warrior on it.\\n\\n Pauline watched as Tanner pressed the ring hard into the recess, and the door began to open. The room was enormous, filled with huge computers and television screens. At a far wall were generators and electronics, all linked together with a control panel in the center.\\n\\n Tanner said, \"Princess, meet Prima. This is ground zero. What you and I have here is something that\u0027s going to change lives forever. This room is the command center of a satellite system that can control the weather in any area of the world. We can cause storms anywhere. We can create famines by stopping rain. We can fog in airports. We can manufacture hurricanes and cyclones that would stop the world\u0027s economy.\" He smiled. \"I\u0027ve already demonstrated some of our power. A lot of countries have been working on weather control, but none of them has solved it yet.\" Tanner pressed a button, and a large television screen lit up. \"What you\u0027re seeing here is a technical advance that the army wishes it had.\" He turned to Pauline and smiled. \"The only wild card that prevented Prima from giving me perfect control was the greenhouse effect, and you took care of that beautifully.\" He sighed. \"Do you know who created this project? Andrew. He really was a genius.\" Pauline was staring at the massive equipment. \"I don\u0027t understand how this can control the weather.\" \"Well, the simple version is that warm air rises toward colder air, and if there is moisture in-\" \"Don\u0027t patronize me, darling.\" \"Sorry, but the longer version is a bit complicated,\" Tanner said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m listening.\" \"It\u0027s a little technical, so bear with me. Microwave lasers, created with the nano-technology my brother produced, when fired into Earth\u0027s atmosphere, make free-forming oxygen that bonds with hydrogen, thus producing ozone and water. Free oxygen in the atmosphere pairs up-that\u0027s why it\u0027s called O2-and my brother discovered that firing that laser from space into the atmosphere made the oxygen bond with two hydrogen atoms into ozone-O,, and water-H2O.\" \"I still don\u0027t understand how that would-\" \"The weather is driven by water. Andrew found in larger-scale tests that so much water was created as a by-product of his experiments that winds shifted. More lasers, more wind.\\n\\n Control the water and the wind, and you control all weather.\" He was thoughtful for a moment. \"When I found out that Akira Iso in Tokyo, and later, Madeleine Smith in Zurich, were close to solving the problem, I offered them jobs here, so I could control them.\\n\\n But they turned me down. I couldn\u0027t afford to let them finish what they were working on.\" He sighed.\\n\\n \"I told you that I had four of my top meteorologists working on the project with me.\" \"Yes.\" \"They were good, too. Franz Verbrugge in Berlin, Mark Harris in Paris, Gary Reynolds in Vancouver, and Richard Stevens in New York. I had each of them trying to solve a different facet of weather control, and I thought that because they were working in different countries, they would never put the pieces together and find out what the ultimate purpose of the project was. But somehow they did.\\n\\n They came to see me in Vienna, to ask me what plans I had for Prima. I told them I was going to give it to our government. I didn\u0027t think they would pursue the matter any further, but just to be safe, I set a trap. When they were sitting in the reception room, I put in a call to your Senate office, making sure they could hear me denying to you that I had ever heard of Prima. The next morning, they began calling you for appointments. That\u0027s when I knew they had to be disposed of.\" Tanner smiled. \"Let me show you what we have here.\" On a computer screen, a map of the world appeared, dotted with lines and symbols. As Tanner spoke, he moved a switch, and the focus of the map kept shifting until it highlighted Portugal.\\n\\n Tanner said, \"The agricultural valleys in Portugal are supplied by rivers that flow to the Atlantic from Spain. Just imagine what would happen to Portugal if it continued to rain until the agricultural valley was drowned out.\" Tanner pressed a button, and on a huge screen appeared a picture of a massive pink palace with ceremonial guards standing watch while its lush, beautiful gardens glimmered in the bright sunlight.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the presidential palace.\" The picture switched to a dining room inside, where a family was having breakfast.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the president of Portugal and his wife and two children. When they speak, it\u0027s going to be in Portuguese, but you\u0027ll hear it in English. I have dozens of nano-cameras and microphones set up in the palace. The president doesn\u0027t know it, but his head security guard works for me.\" An aide was saying to the president, \"At eleven o\u0027clock this morning, you have a meeting at the embassy, followed by a labor union speech. At one p.m., luncheon at the museum.\\n\\n This evening, we\u0027re having a state reception for-\" The phone rang at the breakfast table. The president picked it up. \"Hello.\" Then Tanner\u0027s voice, instantaneously translated from English to Portuguese as he spoke, said \"Mr. President?\" The president looked startled. \"Who is this?\" he asked as his voice was immediately translated from Portuguese to English for Tanner.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m a friend.\" \"Who-how did you get my private number?\" \"That\u0027s not important. I want you to listen very carefully. I love your country, and I would not want to see it destroyed. If you don\u0027t want terrible storms to wipe it off the map, you must send me two billion dollars in gold. If you\u0027re not interested now, I\u0027ll call you back in three days.\" On the screen, they watched the president slam the phone down. He said to his wife, \"Some crazy man got my phone number. Sounds like he escaped from an asylum.\" Tanner turned to Pauline. \"That was recorded three days ago. Now let me show you the conversation we had yesterday.\" A picture of the massive pink palace and its beautiful gardens flashed on again, but this time heavy rains were pouring down, and the sky was ablaze with thunder and lightning.\\n\\n Tanner pressed a button, and the scene on television moved into the president\u0027s office. He was seated at a conference table, with half a dozen assistants all talking at once. The president\u0027s face was grim.\\n\\n The telephone on his desk rang.\\n\\n \"Now.\" Tanner grinned.\\n\\n The president picked up the telephone apprehensively. \"Hello.\" \"Good morning, Mr. President. How-?\" \"You are destroying my country! You have ruined the crops. The fields are flooded. The villages are being-\" He stopped and took a deep breath. \"How long is this going to go on?\" There was hysteria in the president\u0027s voice.\\n\\n \"Until I receive the two billion dollars.\" They watched the president grit his teeth and close his eyes for a moment. \"And you will stop the storms, then?\" Yes.\\n\\n \"How do you want the money delivered?\" \"You see how easy it is, Princess? We already have the money. Let me show you what else Prima can do. These are our earlier tests.\" Tanner pressed another button and a picture of a raging hurricane appeared on the screen. \"This is taking place in Japan,\" Tanner said. \"Real time. And this season for them is always calm weather.\" He pressed a different button and pictures of a violent hailstorm appeared, battering a grove of citrus fruit. \"This is live from Florida. The temperature there now is near zero-in June. The crops are being wiped out.\" He activated another button, and on the giant screen was a scene of a tornado tearing down buildings. \"This is what\u0027s happening in Brazil. As you see,\" Tanner said proudly, \"Prima can do anything.\" Pauline moved closer to him and said softly, \"Like its papa.\" Tanner turned off the television set. He picked up three DVDs and showed them to her. \"These are three interesting conversations that I had with Peru, Mexico, and Italy. Do you know how the gold is delivered? We send trucks to their banks and they fill them. And then there\u0027s Catch Twenty-two. If they make any attempt to find out where the gold is going, I promise them that the storm will begin again and never stop.\" Pauline looked at him, worried. \"Tanner, is there any way they can trace your calls?\" Tanner laughed. \"I hope they do. If someone tries to trace them, they\u0027ll reach a relay in a church, then a second relay takes them to a school. The third relay will set up storms they\u0027ll wish they had never seen. And the fourth time it ends up at the Oval Office of the White House.\" Pauline laughed.\\n\\n The door opened and Andrew walked in.\\n\\n Tanner turned. \"Ah. Here\u0027s my dear brother.\" Andrew was staring at Pauline, a puzzled expression on his face. \"Don\u0027t I know you?\" He looked at her for almost a minute as he concentrated, and then his face lit up. \"You-you and Tanner were?going to get married. I was the best man. You\u0027re-you\u0027re Princess.\" Pauline said, \"Very good, Andrew.\" \"But you-you went away. You didn\u0027t love Tanner.\" Tanner spoke up. \"Let me straighten you out. She went away because she did love me.\" He took Pauline\u0027s hand. \"She telephoned me the day after her wedding. She married a very rich, influential man so she could use her husband\u0027s influence to get important clients for KIG.\\n\\n That\u0027s why we were able to grow so fast.\" Tanner gave Pauline a hug. \"We arranged to meet secretly every month.\" He said proudly, \"And then she got interested in politics and became a senator.\" Andrew frowned. \"But-but Sebastiana-Sebastiana-\" \"Sebastiana Cortez.\" Tanner laughed. \"She was a decoy, to throw people off the track. I made sure that everyone at the office knew about her. Princess and I couldn\u0027t afford to let anyone become suspicious.\" Andrew said vaguely, \"Oh, I see.\" \"Come over here, Andrew.\" Tanner led him to the control center. They stood in front of Prima.\\n\\n Tanner said, \"Do you remember this? You helped develop it. Now it\u0027s finished.\" Andrew\u0027s eyes widened. \"Prima? Tanner pointed to a button and said, \"Yes. Weather control.\" He pointed to another button. \"Location.\" He looked at his brother. \"See how simple we made it?\" Andrew said, under his breath, \"I remember? Tanner turned to Pauline. \"This is only the beginning, Princess.\" Tanner took her in his arms. \"I\u0027m researching thirty more countries.\\n\\n \"You got what you wanted. Power and money.\" Pauline said happily, \"A computer like that could be worth-\" \"Two computers like that,\" Tanner said. \"I have a surprise for you. Have you ever heard of Tamoa Island, in the South Pacific?\" \"No.\" \"We just bought it. It\u0027s sixty square miles and unbelievably beautiful. It\u0027s in the French Polynesian islands, and it has a landing strip and a yacht harbor. It has everything, including\"-he paused dramatically-\"Prima II.\" Pauline said, \"You mean there\u0027s another-?\" Tanner nodded. \"That\u0027s right. It\u0027s underground, where no one can ever find it.\\n\\n Now that those two nosy bitches are finally out of the way, the world is ours.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark/page-43.html","bookId":2370,"book":{"id":2370,"title":"Are You Afraid of the Dark?","description":"Storyline: The new novel that Sidney Sheldon\u0027s millions of fans all over the world have been waiting for.
