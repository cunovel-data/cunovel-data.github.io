{"id":69708,"no":45,"title":"Page 45","content":"THEY DROVE into White Plains, twenty-five miles north of Manhattan, Diane said,\\n\\n \"This looks like a nice town. What are we doing here?\" \"I have a friend here. She\u0027ll take care of us.\" \"Tell me about her.\" Kelly said slowly, \"My mother was married to a drunk who enjoyed beating her.\\n\\n When I was able to afford to take care of my mother, I persuaded her to leave him. One of the models who had run away from an abusive boyfriend told me about this place. It\u0027s a boardinghouse run by an angel of a woman named Grace Seidel.\\n\\n I took my mother there to stay until I could find an apartment for her. I used to visit her at Grace\u0027s every day. My mother loved it and became friends with some of the boarders. I finally found an apartment for Mother and went to pick her up.\" She stopped.\\n\\n Diane looked at her. \"What happened?\"\\n\\n \"She had gone back to her husband.\" They had reached the boardinghouse. \"We\u0027re here.\"\\n\\n GRACE SEIDEL WAS in her fifties, a dynamic, motherly ball of energy. When she opened the door and saw Kelly, her face lit up.\\n\\n \"Kelly!\" She threw her arms around her. \"I\u0027m so glad to see you.\" Kelly said, \"This is my friend Diane.\" They exchanged hellos.\\n\\n \"Your room is all ready for you,\" Grace said. \"As a matter of fact, it was your mother\u0027s room. I had an extra bed put in.\" As Grace Seidel walked them to their bedroom, they passed through a comfortable-looking living room where a dozen women were playing card games or doing various other activities.\\n\\n \"How long will you be staying?\" Grace asked.\\n\\n Kelly and Diane looked at each other. \"We\u0027re not sure.\" Grace Seidel smiled. \"No problem. The room is yours for as long as you want it.\" The room was lovely-neat and clean.\\n\\n When Grace Seidel had left, Kelly said to Diane, \"We\u0027ll be safe here. And by the way, I think we made the Guinness Book of World Records. Do you know how many times they\u0027ve tried to kill us?\" \"Yes.\" Diane was standing by the window. Kelly heard her say, \"Thank you, Richard.\" Kelly started to speak, then thought, It\u0027s no use.\\n\\n ANDREW, DOZING AT his desk, dreamed that he was asleep in a hospital bed. It was the voices in the room that had awakened him. \"?And luckily, I discovered this when we were decontaminating Andrew\u0027s safety equipment. I thought I should show it to you right away.\" \"The goddamn army told me it would be safe.\" A man was handing Tanner one of the gas masks from the army-experiment.\\n\\n \"I found a tiny hole at the base of the mask. It looks like someone cut it. That would be enough to cause your brother\u0027s condition.\" Tanner looked at the mask and thundered, \"Whoever is responsible for this is going to pay.\" He looked at the man and said, \"I\u0027ll look into this immediately. Thanks for bringing it to me.\" From his bed, Andrew groggily watched the man leave. Tanner looked at the mask a moment and then walked over to a corner of the room where there was a large hospital cart filled with soiled linens.\\n\\n Tanner reached down into the bottom of the cart and buried the gas mask under the linens.\\n\\n Andrew tried to ask his brother what was happening, but he was too tired. He fell asleep.\\n\\n TANNER, ANDREW, AND Pauline had returned to Tanner\u0027s office.\\n\\n Tanner had asked his secretary to bring in the morning newspapers. Tanner skimmed through the front pages. \"Look at these: \u0027Scientists are baffled by freak storms in Guatemala, Peru, Mexico, and Italy. \u0027 \" He looked at Pauline exultantly. \"And this is only the beginning.\\n\\n They\u0027re going to have a lot more to be baffled about.\" Vince Carballo came running into the room. \"Mr. Kingsley-\" \"I\u0027m busy. What is it?\" \"Flint is dead.\" Tanner\u0027s jaw dropped. \"What? What are you talking about? What happened?\" \"Stevens and Harris killed him.\" \"That\u0027s impossible!\" \"He\u0027s dead. They escaped and took off in the senator\u0027s car. We reported it stolen. The police found it in White Plains.\" Tanner\u0027s voice was grim. \"Here\u0027s what I want you to do. I want you to take a dozen men and go to White Plains. Check every hotel, boardinghouse, and flophouse-any place where they could be hiding. I\u0027m giving a five-million-dollar reward to anyone who turns them in.\\n\\n Move it!\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n Vince Carballo hurried out the door.\\n\\n In their ROOM at Grace Seidel\u0027s boardinghouse, Diane said, \"I\u0027m sorry about what happened when you got to Paris. Did they kill the concierge?\" \"I don\u0027t know. They just disappeared.\" \"What about your dog, Angel?\" Kelly said tightly, \"I don\u0027t want to talk about it.\" \"I\u0027m sorry. Do you know what\u0027s frustrating? We were so close. Now that we know what happened, there\u0027s no one we can tell it to. It would be our word against KIG\u0027s. They would put us in an asylum.\" Kelly nodded. \"You\u0027re right. There is no one left to go to.\" There was a momentary silence and Diane said slowly, \"I think there is.\"\\n\\n VlNCE CARBALLO\u0027s MEN were spread all over town, checking every hotel, boardinghouse, and flophouse. One of his men showed pictures of Diane and Kelly to the clerk at the Esplanade Hotel.\\n\\n \"Have you seen either of these ladies? There\u0027s a five-million-dollar reward for them.\" The clerk shook his head. \"I wish I knew where they were.\" At the Renaissance Westchester Hotel, another man was holding up pictures of Diane and Kelly.\\n\\n \"Five million? I wish I could collect that.\" At the Crowne Plaza, the clerk was saying, \"If I see them, I\u0027ll sure let you know, mister.\" Vince Carballo himself knocked at the door of Grace Seidel\u0027s boardinghouse.\\n\\n \"Good morning.\" \"Good morning. My name is Vince Carballo.\" He held up a picture of the two women. \"Have you seen these women? There\u0027s a five-million-dollar reward for them.\" Grace Seidel\u0027s face lit up. \"Kelly!\"\\n\\n IN TANNER\u0027S OFFICE, Kathy Ordonez was overwhelmed. Faxes were coming in faster than she could handle them, and her e-mail in-box was inundated. She picked up a pile of the papers and walked into Tanner\u0027s office. Tanner and Pauline Van Luven were seated on a couch, talking.\\n\\n Tanner looked up as his secretary came in. \"What is it?\" She smiled. \"Good news. You\u0027re going to have a very successful dinner party.\" He frowned. \"What are you talking about?\" She held up the papers. \"These are all acceptances. Everyone\u0027s coming.\" Tanner got up. \"Coming where? Let me see those.\" Kathy handed him the papers and went out to her desk.\\n\\n Tanner read the first e-mail aloud. \" \u0027We would be delighted to come to dinner at KIG Headquarters on Friday to see the unveiling of Prima, your weather control machine.\u0027 From the editor of Time magazine.\" His face turned white. He looked at the next one. \" \u0027Thank you for your invitation to see Prima, your weather control computer, at KIG Headquarters. We look forward to being there.\u0027 It\u0027s signed by the editor of Newsweek.\" He skimmed the rest of them. \"CBS, NBC, CNN, the Wall Street Journal, the Chicago Tribune, and the London Times, all eager to see the unveiling of Prima.\" Pauline sat there, speechless.\\n\\n Tanner was so furious, he could hardly speak. \"What the hell is going on-?\" He stopped.\\n\\n \"Those bitches!\"\\n\\n AT IRMA\u0027S INTERNET Cafe, Diane was busily operating a computer. She looked up at Kelly.\\n\\n \"Have we left anyone out?\" Kelly said, \"Elle, Cosmopolitan, Vanity Fair, Mademoiselle, Readers Digest? Diane laughed. \"I think this does it. I hope Kingsley has a good caterer. He\u0027s going to have a big party.\"\\n\\n Vince carballo was looking at Grace Seidel excitedly. \"You know Kelly?\" \"Oh, yes,\" Grace said. \"She\u0027s one of the most famous models in the world.\" Vince Carballo\u0027s face lit up. \"Where is she?\" Grace looked at him in surprise. \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve never met her.\" His face reddened. \"You said you knew her.\" \"I mean-everybody knows her. She\u0027s very famous. Isn\u0027t she beautiful?\" \"You have no idea where she is?\" Grace said thoughtfully, \"I do have kind of an idea.\" \"Where?\" \"I saw a woman who looked like her get on a bus this morning. She was traveling with someone-\" \"What bus was it?\" \"It was the bus to Vermont.\" \"Thanks.\" Vince Carballo hurried away.\\n\\n TANNER THREW THE pile of faxes and e-mails to the floor and turned to Pauline.\\n\\n \"Do you know what those bitches have done? We can\u0027t let anyone see Prima.\" He was thoughtful for a long moment.\\n\\n \"I think Prima will have an accident the day before the party and blow up.\" Pauline looked at him a moment and then smiled. \"Prima II.\" Tanner nodded. \"That\u0027s right. We can travel around the world, and anytime we\u0027re ready, we\u0027ll go to Tamoa and start operating Prima II.\" Kathy Ordonez\u0027s voice came over the intercom. She sounded frantic. She buzzed into Tanner\u0027s office. \"Mr. Kingsley, the phones are going crazy. I have the New York Times, the Washington Post, and Larry King, all holding for you.\" \"Tell them I\u0027m in a meeting.\" Tanner turned to Pauline. \"We have to get out of here.\" He patted Andrew on the shoulder. \"Andrew, come with us.\" \"Yes, Tanner.\" The three of them walked over to the redbrick building. \"I have something very important for you to do, Andrew.\" \"Anything you want,\" Andrew said.\\n\\n TANNER LED THE way into the redbrick building and walked over to Prima. Tanner turned to Andrew. \"Here\u0027s what I want you to do. Princess and I have to leave now, but at six o\u0027clock, I want you to turn this computer off. It\u0027s very simple.\" He pointed. \"You see this big red button?\" Andrew nodded. \"I see it.\" \"All you have to do is press it three times, at six o\u0027clock. Three times. Can you remember that?\" Andrew said, \"Yes, Tanner. Six o\u0027clock. Three times.\" \"Right. See you later.\" Tanner and Pauline started to walk out.\\n\\n Andrew looked after them. \"You\u0027re not taking me with you?\" \"No. You stay here. Just remember: six o\u0027clock, three times.\" \"I\u0027ll remember.\" As they walked outside, Pauline said, \"What if he doesn\u0027t remember?\" Tanner laughed. \"It doesn\u0027t matter. It\u0027s set to explode automatically at six o\u0027clock. I just wanted to make sure he\u0027s there when it happens.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark/page-45.html","bookId":2370,"book":{"id":2370,"title":"Are You Afraid of the Dark?","description":"Storyline: The new novel that Sidney Sheldon\u0027s millions of fans all over the world have been waiting for.
