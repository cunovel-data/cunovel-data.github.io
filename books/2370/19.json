{"id":69682,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"THE FOLLOWING DAY Tanner was sitting quietly at his desk when his secretary buzzed.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a committee here to see you, Mr. Kingsley.\" \"A committee?\" Yes, sir.\\n\\n \"Send them in.\" Supervisors from several Kingsley Group departments walked into Tanner\u0027s office.\\n\\n \"We\u0027d like to talk to you, Mr. Kingsley.\" \"Sit down.\" They took seats.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the problem?\" One of the foremen said, \"Well, we\u0027re kind of worried. After what\u0027s happened to your brother?\\n\\n Is Kingsley Group going to stay in business?\" Tanner shook his head. \"I don\u0027t know. At this point I\u0027m still in shock. I can\u0027t believe what\u0027s happened to Andrew.\" He was thoughtful for a moment. \"I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do. I can\u0027t predict our chances, but I\u0027m going to make every effort to see if we can stay afloat. That\u0027s a promise. I\u0027ll keep you informed.\" There were murmurs of \"Thank you,\" and Tanner watched the men depart.\\n\\n THE DAY THAT Andrew got out of the hospital, Tanner set him up in a little staff house on the property, where he could be taken care of, and gave him an office next to his. The employees were stunned to see what had happened to Andrew. He had changed from a brilliant, alert scientist to a zombie. Most of the day Andrew sat in his chair, looking out the window, half asleep, but he seemed happy to be back at Kingsley Group, even though he had little idea of what was going on. All the employees were touched by how well Tanner treated his brother and how solicitous and caring he was of him.\\n\\n THE ATMOSPHERE AT Kingsley Group changed almost overnight. When Andrew was running it, it had been casual. Now suddenly it had become more formal and was being run as a business instead of a philanthropy. Tanner sent out agents to sign up clients for the company. Business began to flourish at an extraordinary pace, and Tanner changed the company name to Kingsley International Group, just as he had planned.\\n\\n WORD ABOUT PRINCESSS\u0027S good-bye note had spread quickly through KIG. The employees had been prepared for the marriage, and they wondered how Tanner would take this blow. There was a great deal of speculation among the staff about what he would do after being jilted.\\n\\n Two days after Tanner had received the letter, an item had appeared in the newspapers announcing that Tanner\u0027s bride-to-be had married Edmond Barclay, a billionaire media tycoon. The only changes in Tanner Kingsley seemed to be an increased moodiness and a work ethic that was even stronger than it was before.\\n\\n Every morning he spent two hours alone, working on a project that was shrouded in secrecy.\\n\\n ONE EVENING, TANNER was invited to speak at MENSA, the high-IQ society. Since many of the employees at KIG were members, he agreed to accept.\\n\\n When Tanner came into headquarters the following morning, he was accompanied by one of the most beautiful women his staff had ever seen. She was Latin looking, with dark eyes, an olive complexion, and a sensational figure.\\n\\n Tanner introduced her to the staff. \"This is Sebastiana Cortez. She spoke at MENSA last night. She was brilliant.\" Tanner\u0027s whole attitude suddenly seemed lighter. Tanner took Sebastiana into his office, and they did not reappear for more than an hour. After they came out, they had lunch in Tanner\u0027s private dining room.\\n\\n One of the employees looked up Sebastiana Cortez on the Internet. She was a former Miss Argentina, and her home was in Cincinnati, where she was married to a prominent businessman.\\n\\n When Sebastiana and Tanner went back into his office after lunch, Tanner buzzed his secretary and told her to hold all calls. Moments later, Tanner\u0027s voice could be heard in the reception room through the intercom, which had been left open.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry, darling. We\u0027ll find a way to make it work.\" The secretaries started gathering around the intercom, eagerly listening to the conversation.\\n\\n \"We have to be very careful. My husband is a jealous man.\" \"There\u0027s no problem. I\u0027ll make arrangements for us to keep in touch.\" It did not take a genius to figure out what was happening. The staff was amazed at how quickly he had gotten over Princess. It was all that the secretaries could do to keep from giggling. \"I\u0027m sorry you have to go home just now.\" \"I am, too. I wish I could stay, but-it can\u0027t be helped.\"\\n\\n WHEN TANNER AND Sebastiana left the office, they were the picture of decorum.\\n\\n The staff took delight in the idea that Tanner had no clue they were aware of what was going on.\\n\\n The day after Sebastiana departed, Tanner arranged for a phone, gilded in gold, to be installed in his office with a digital scrambler. His secretary and assistants had orders never to answer it.\\n\\n From that time on, Tanner spoke on the gold phone almost every day, and at the end of each month, he went away for a long weekend and came back looking refreshed. He never told his staff where he had been, but they knew.\\n\\n Two of Tanner\u0027s aides were talking, and one of them said to the other, \"Does the word rendezvous ring a bell?\" Tanner\u0027s love life had started again, and the change in him was remarkable.\\n\\n Everybody was happy. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark/page-19.html","bookId":2370,"book":{"id":2370,"title":"Are You Afraid of the Dark?","description":"Storyline: The new novel that Sidney Sheldon\u0027s millions of fans all over the world have been waiting for.
