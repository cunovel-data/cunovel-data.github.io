They had their choice of renting a car from Hertz, Europe Car, Avis, and others, but they chose Alesa, a more obscure rental agency.\n \"What is the quickest way to get to San Sebastian?\" Diane asked.\n \"It is very simple, se�ora. Take the N-l to the French border at Hondarribia, then right to San Sebastian. It is just a four?or five-hour drive.\" \"Gracias.\" And Kelly and Diane were on their way.\n WHEN THE KIG private jet arrived in Madrid, one hour later, Harry Flint hurried from one rental car booth to another.\n \"I was supposed to meet my sister and her girlfriend here-the girlfriend is a stunning African-American-and I missed them. They arrived on the Delta nine-twenty from New York.\n Did they rent a car here?\"\n \"No, se�or? No, se�or?\n \"No, se�or?\n At the Alesa booth, Flint was in luck.\n \"Oh, yes, se�or. I remember them well. They-\" \"Do you remember what they rented?\" \"It was a Peugeot.\" \"What color?\" \"Red. It was our only-\" \"Do you have the number of the license plate?\" \"Of course. Just a moment.\" Flint watched the clerk open a book to look it up.\n He gave Flint the number. \"I hope you find them.\" \"I will.\" Ten minutes later, Flint was flying back to Barcelona. He would rent a car, watch for their red Peugeot, follow them to a place in the road where there was no traffic, run them off the road, and make certain that they were dead.\n DIANE AND KELLY were only thirty minutes away from San Sebastian, driving along in a comfortable silence. The highway was un-crowded, and they were making good time.\n The countryside was beautiful. Ripe fields and orchards filled the air with the smells of pomegranate, apricot, and orange trees, and off the road were old houses, with walls covered with jasmine vines.\n A few minutes out of the little medieval town of Burgos, the scenery began to erupt into the foothills of the Pyrenees.\n \"We\u0027re almost there,\" Diane said. She looked ahead, frowned, and started to slam on the brakes.\n Two hundred feet in front of them was a burning car with a crowd gathered around it. The highway was blocked off by men in uniform.\n Diane was puzzled. \"What\u0027s going on?\" \"We\u0027re in Basque country,\" Kelly said. \"It\u0027s a war. The Basques have been fighting the Spanish government for the last fifty years.\" A man in a green uniform with gold and red trim and a black belt, black shoes, and black beret stepped onto the highway in front of the car and held up his hand. He pointed to the side of the road.\n Kelly said under her breath, \"It\u0027s the ETA. We can\u0027t stop, because God knows how long they\u0027ll keep us here.\" The officer walked to the side of the car and approached them. \"I am Captain Iradi. You will please get out of the car.\" Diane looked at him and smiled. \"I really would love to help you with your war, but we\u0027re busy fighting our own war.\" She slammed her foot down on the accelerator, drove around the burning car, and sped ahead, the car weaving through the screaming crowd.\n Kelly\u0027s eyes were closed. \"Did we hit anybody yet?\" \"We\u0027re fine.\" As Kelly opened her eyes, she looked in the side-view mirror and froze. A black Citroen Berlingo was behind them and she could see the man behind the wheel.\n \"It\u0027s Godzilla!\" Kelly gasped. \"He\u0027s following us.\" \"What? How could he have found us so quickly?\" Diane pressed the accelerator all the way to the floor. The Citroen was gaining on them. Diane looked at the double-faced speedometer. One dial read: 175 kilometers an hour. The other dial read: 110 miles an hour.\n Nervously, Kelly said, \"I\u0027ll bet you\u0027re too fast to drive at the Indianapolis racetrack.\" A mile ahead Diane saw the customs checkpoint between Spain and France.\n \"Hit me,\" Diane said.\n Kelly laughed. \"I was only kidding, I just-\" \"Hit me.\" Diane\u0027s voice was urgent.\n The Citroen was getting closer.\n \"What are you-?\" Do it now!\" Reluctantly, Kelly slapped Diane across the face.\n \"No. Punch me hard.\" There were now only two cars between them and the Citroen.\n \"Hurry,\" Diane shouted.\n Wincing, Kelly punched Diane on the cheek.\n \"Harder.\" Kelly hit her again. This time, her diamond wedding ring made a gash in Diane\u0027s cheek, and blood started flowing.\n Kelly was looking at Diane, horrified. \"I\u0027m so sorry, Diane. I didn\u0027t mean to-\" They had reached the customs checkpoint. Diane braked to a stop.\n The border guard approached the car. \"Good afternoon, ladies.\" \"Good afternoon.\" Diane turned her head so that the guard could see the blood running down her cheek.\n He looked at it, aghast. \"Se�ora, what happened?\" Diane bit her lip. \"It\u0027s my ex-husband. He enjoys hitting me. I got a restraining order against him, but I-I can\u0027t stop him. He keeps following me. He\u0027s back there now. I know there\u0027s no use asking for your help. No one can stop him.\" When the guard turned around to scan the line of approaching cars, his face was grim. \"Which car is he in?\" \"The black Citroen, two cars back. I think he plans to kill me.\" \"He does, does he?\" the guard growled. \"You ladies go on. You won\u0027t have to worry about him anymore.\" Diane looked at him tearfully and said, \"Oh, thank you. Thank you.\" A moment later, they had crossed the border and were driving into France.\n \"Diane-\"\n \"Yes?\" Kelly put her hand on Diane\u0027s shoulder. \"I\u0027m so sorry about-\" She pointed to Diane\u0027s cheek.\n Diane grinned. \"It got rid of Godzilla, didn\u0027t it?\" She glanced at Kelly.\n \"You\u0027re crying.\" \"No, I\u0027m not.\" Kelly sniffed. \"It\u0027s the damn mascara. What you did was-you\u0027re not just a pretty face, are you?\" Kelly asked as she dabbed at Diane\u0027s wound with a tissue.\n Diane looked in the rearview mirror and grimaced. \"Not anymore, I\u0027m not.\"\n WHEN HARRY FLINT reached the border checkpoint, the patrol H guard was waiting.\n \"Step out of the car, please.\" \"I haven\u0027t time for that,\" Flint said. \"I\u0027m in a hurry. I have to-\" \"Step out of the car.\" Flint looked at him. \"Why? What\u0027s the problem?\" \"We have a report that a car with this license number has been smuggling drugs.\n We\u0027re going to have to take the car apart.\" Flint glared at him. \"Are you crazy? I told you, I\u0027m in a hurry. Drugs were never smuggled-?\" He stopped and smiled. \"I get it.\" He reached in his pocket and handed the guard a hundred-dollar bill.\n \"Here you are. Take this and forget about it.\" The border guard called out, \"Jose!\" A uniformed captain approached. The border guard handed him the hundred-dollar bill.\n \"This is an attempted bribe.\" The captain said to Flint, \"Remove yourself from the car. You are under arrest for bribery. Pull over to that lot-\" \"No. You can\u0027t arrest me now. I\u0027m in the middle of-\" \"And resisting arrest.\" He turned to the guard. \"Call for a backup.\" Flint looked ahead at the highway and took a deep breath. The Peugeot was out of sight.\n Flint turned to the captain. \"I have to make a phone call.\"\n AS DIANE AND Kelly sped through the French countryside, the flat central plateau of the Castilian meseta began to break up into the foothills of the Pyrenees and the Sierra de Urbasa.\n Diane spoke. \"You said you had a friend in Paris?\" \"Yes. Sam Meadows. He worked with Mark. I have a feeling he can help us.\" Kelly reached into her purse, took out her new cell phone, and dialed a number in Paris.\n An operator said, \"KIG.\"\n \"Could I speak to Sam Meadows, please?\"\n A minute later, Kelly heard his voice.\n \"Hello.\" \"Sam, it\u0027s Kelly. I\u0027m on my way to Paris.\" \"My God! I\u0027ve been worried sick about you. Are you all right?\" Kelly hesitated. \"I think so.\" \"This is a nightmare,\" Sam Meadows said. \"I still can\u0027t believe it.\" Neither can I, Kelly thought. \"Sam, I have to tell you something. I believe Mark was murdered.\" Sam Meadows\u0027s answer sent a chill through her. \"So do I.\" Kelly was finding it difficult to speak. \"I have to know what happened. Can you help me?\" \"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s something we should discuss on the phone, Kelly.\" He was trying to make his voice sound very casual.\n \"I-I understand.\" \"Why don\u0027t we talk about it tonight? We can have dinner at my place.\n \"Fine.\"\n \"Seven o\u0027clock?\"\n \"I\u0027ll be there,\" Kelly said.\n Kelly ended the call. \"I\u0027m going to get some answers tonight.\" \"While you\u0027re doing that, I\u0027m going to fly to Berlin and talk to people who worked with Franz Verbrugge.\" Kelly was suddenly silent.\n Diane glanced at her. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" \"Nothing. It\u0027s just that we\u0027re-we\u0027re such a great team. I hate for us to split up. Why don\u0027t we go to Paris together and then-?\" Diane smiled. \"We\u0027re not splitting up, Kelly. When you\u0027re through talking to Sam Meadows, you call me. We can meet in Berlin. I should have some information by then. We have our cell phones. We can stay in touch. I\u0027m eager to hear what you\u0027re going to learn tonight.\" They had reached Paris.\n Diane glanced in the rearview mirror. \"No Citroen. We\u0027ve finally lost him. Where do you want me to take you?\" Kelly looked out the window. They were nearing la Place de la Concorde.\n \"Diane, why don\u0027t you turn the car in and be on your way? I can get a taxi here.\" \"Are you sure, partner?\" \"I\u0027m sure, partner.\" \"Be careful.\" You,too.\n TWO MINUTES LATER, Kelly was in a taxi, on the way to her apartment, eagerly looking forward to going home again. In a short while, she would meet Sam Meadows at his apartment for dinner.\n When the taxi pulled up in front of Kelly\u0027s apartment building, she felt a deep sense of relief. She was home. The doorman opened the door.\n Kelly looked up and started to say, \"I\u0027m back, Martin-\" and stopped. The doorman was a complete stranger.\n \"Good evening, madame.\"\n \"Good evening. Where is Martin?\"\n \"Martin no longer works here. He quit.\"\n Kelly was taken aback. \"Oh. I\u0027m sorry.\" \"Please, madame, allow me to introduce myself. I am Jerome Malo.\" Kelly nodded.\n She walked into the lobby. A tall, thin stranger was standing behind the reception desk, next to Nicole Paradis.\n The stranger smiled. \"Good evening, Madame Harris. We have been expecting you. I am Alphonse Girouard, the concierge.\" Kelly looked around, puzzled. \"Where\u0027s Philippe Cendre?\" \"Ah. Philippe and his family moved to somewhere in Spain.\" He shrugged. \"Some business deal, I believe.\" Kelly felt a growing sudden sense of alarm. \"And their daughter?\" \"She left with them.\" Did I tell you that my daughter has been accepted at the Sorbonne? It\u0027s a dream come true.\n Kelly tried to keep her voice steady. \"When did they leave?\" \"A few days ago, but please, do not worry, madame. You will be taken good care of. Your apartment is all ready for you.\" Nicole Paradis, sitting at her desk, looked up. \"Welcome home.\" But her eyes were saying something else.\n \"Where is Angel?\" \"Oh, your little dog? Philippe took her with him.\" Kelly was fighting a wave of panic. She was having trouble breathing.\n \"Shall we go now, madame? We have a little surprise for you in your apartment.\" I\u0027ll bet you have. Kelly\u0027s mind was racing. \"Yes, just one minute,\" Kelly said.\n \"There\u0027s something\n I forgot to pick up.\" Before Girouard could say anything, Kelly was outside, hurrying down the street.\n Jerome Malo and Alphonse Girouard stood on the sidewalk, looking after her.\n Caught off guard, it was too late to stop her. They watched her get into a taxi.\n My God! What have they done with Philippe and his family, and with Angel? Kelly wondered.\n \"Where to, mademoiselle?\" \"Just drive!\" Tonight I\u0027m going to find out what\u0027s behind all this, Kelly thought.\n IN HIS APARTMENT, Sam Meadows was finishing a phone conversation. \"Yes, I understand how important it is. It will be taken care of?I\u0027m expecting her in a few minutes for dinner?\n Yes�I\u0027ve already arranged for someone to dispose of her body?Thank you. That\u0027s very generous of you, Mr. Kingsley.\" As Sam Meadows replaced the receiver, he looked at his watch.\n His dinner guest was due to arrive any minute. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark/page-36.html","bookId":2370,"book":{"id":2370,"title":"Are You Afraid of the Dark?","description":"Storyline: \n The new novel that Sidney Sheldon\u0027s millions of fans all over the world have been waiting for.
