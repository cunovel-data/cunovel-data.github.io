The treats are for Angel.\" Kelly took the bags. \"I thank you, and Angel thanks you.\" She watched Mark petting Angel and asked innocently, \"Are you looking forward to the game?\" Mark nodded and said enthusiastically, \"Oh, yes.\" Kelly smiled. \"Good. So am I.\" She knew that Mark had never even seen a soccer game.\n THE PARIS SAINT-GERMAIN stadium was packed to capacity, with sixty-seven thousand eager fans waiting for the championship game between Lyon and Marseille to begin.\n As Kelly and Mark were ushered to their seats directly above mid-field, Kelly said, \"I\u0027m impressed.\n These seats are hard to get.\" Mark smiled and said, \"When you love soccer as much as I do, nothing is impossible.\" Kelly bit her lip to keep from laughing. She could not wait for the game to begin.\n AT 1400 HOURS, both teams entered the stadium, standing at attention while the band played \"La Marseillaise,\" the French national anthem. As the lineups for Lyon and Marseille faced the stands for introductions, a player for Lyon stepped forward, wearing the Lyon logo in the team colors of blue and white.\n Kelly decided to relent and let Mark know what was happening. She leaned toward him. \"That\u0027s their goalie,\" Kelly explained. He s\"I know,\" Mark said. \"Gregory Coupet. He\u0027s the best goalie in the league. He won a championship against Bordeaux last April. He won a UEFA Cup and a Champion League the year before that.\n He\u0027s thirty-one years old, six feet tall, and weighs a hundred and eighty pounds.\" Kelly looked at Mark in astonishment.\n The announcer continued. \"Playing forward, Sidney Gouvou? \"Number fourteen,\" Mark enthused. \"He\u0027s incredible. Last week, against Auxerre, he scored a goal in the last minute of the game.\" Kelly listened in amazement as Mark knowledgably discussed all the other players.\n The game began and the crowd went wild.\n It was a frenzied, exciting game, and goalies for both teams fought hard to keep their opponents from scoring. It was difficult for Kelly to concentrate. She kept looking at Mark, amazed by his expertise.\n How could I have been so wrong?\n In the middle of a play, Mark exclaimed, \"Gouvou\u0027s going for a flick kick! He made it!\" A few minutes later, Mark said, \"Watch! Carriere\u0027s going to be fined for handling the ball.\" And he was right.\n When Lyon won, Mark was euphoric. \"What a great team!\" As they were leaving the stadium, Kelly asked, \"Mark-how long have you been interested in soccer?\" He looked at Kelly sheepishly and said, \"About three days. I\u0027ve been researching it on my computer. Since you were so interested, I thought I should learn about it.\" And Kelly was incredibly touched. It was unbelievable that Mark had spent so much time and effort just because she enjoyed the game.\n They had made a date for the following day, after Kelly finished a modeling assignment.\n \"I can pick you up at your dressing room and-\" \"No!\" She did not want him to meet the other models.\n Mark was looking at her, puzzled.\n \"I mean-there\u0027s a rule that men aren\u0027t allowed in the dressing rooms.\" \"Oh.\" I don\u0027t want you to fall in love with* * * \"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, please fasten your seat belts and return your seat backs and trays to their upright and locked positions. We\u0027re approaching Kennedy airport and we\u0027ll be landing in just a few minutes.\" Kelly was jolted back to the present. She was in New York to meet Tanner Kingsley, the man whom Mark had worked for.\n SOMEONE HAD INFORMED the media. When the plane landed, they were waiting for Kelly. She was surrounded by reporters with television cameras and microphones.\n \"Kelly, would you look this way?\" \"Can you tell us what you think happened to your husband?\" \"Is there going to be a police investigation?\" \"Were you and your husband planning a divorce?\" \"Are you moving back here to the States?\" \"How did you feel when you heard what happened?\" The most insensitive question of all.\n Kelly saw a pleasant-faced, alert-looking man standing in the background. He smiled and waved to Kelly and she motioned for him to come over to her.\n Ben Roberts was one of the most popular and respected talk-show hosts on network television. He had interviewed Kelly before, and they had become friends. She watched as Ben made his way through the crowd of reporters. They all knew him.\n \"Hey, Ben! Is Kelly going to be on your show?\" \"Do you think she\u0027ll talk about what happened?\" \"Can I get a picture of you and Kelly?\" By this time, Ben had reached Kelly\u0027s side. The tide of reporters was pushing against them. Ben called out, \"Let\u0027s give her a break, boys and girls. You can talk to her later.\" Reluctantly, the reporters began to give way.\n Ben took Kelly\u0027s hand and said, \"I can\u0027t tell you how sorry I am. I liked Mark so much.\" \"That was mutual, Ben.\" As Kelly and Ben made their way toward the baggage claim area, he asked, \"Off the record, what are you doing in New York?\" \"I\u0027m here to see Tanner Kingsley.\" Ben nodded. \"He\u0027s a powerful man. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll be well taken care of.\" They had reached the baggage counter. \"Kelly, if there is anything I can do for you, you can always reach me at the network.\" He looked around. \"Are you being picked up? If not, I\u0027ll-\" At that moment, a uniformed chauffeur came up to Kelly. \"Mrs. Harris? I\u0027m Colin.\n The car is right outside. Mr. Kingsley has checked you into a suite at the Peninsula Hotel. If you\u0027ll give me your tickets, I\u0027ll attend to your luggage.\" Kelly turned to Ben. \"Will you call me?\" \"Of course.\"\n TEN MINUTES LATER Kelly was on her way to the hotel. As they weaved through traffic, Colin said, \"Mr. Kingsley\u0027s secretary will telephone you and set up an appointment.\n The car will be at your disposal whenever you need it.\" \"Thank you.\" What am I doing here? Kelly wondered.\n She was about to get the answer. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark/page-14.html","bookId":2370,"book":{"id":2370,"title":"Are You Afraid of the Dark?","description":"Storyline: \n The new novel that Sidney Sheldon\u0027s millions of fans all over the world have been waiting for.
