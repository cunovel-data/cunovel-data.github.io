Diane said, \"That\u0027s why Richard and Mark were going to Washington, to see Senator Van Luven.\" \"How do we get hold of her?\" \"Simple.\" Diane took out her cell phone. Kelly held up a hand to stop her. \"No. Let\u0027s use a pay phone.\" They got the telephone number of the Senate office building from information, and Diane called from a public phone. \"Senator Van Luven\u0027s office.\" \"I\u0027d like to speak to the senator, please.\" \"May I say who\u0027s calling?\" Diane said, \"It\u0027s a personal matter.\" \"Your name, please?\" \"I can\u0027t-just tell her it\u0027s very important.\" \"I\u0027m sorry, I can\u0027t do that.\" The line was disconnected. Diane turned to Kelly. \"We can\u0027t use our names.\" Diane called the number again. \"Senator Van Luven\u0027s office.\" \"Please, listen to me. This is not a crank call. I need to speak to the senator, and I can\u0027t give you my name.\" \"Then I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t let you speak to the senator.\" The call was disconnected. Diane dialed again. \"Senator Van Luven\u0027s office.\" \"Please don\u0027t hang up. I know you\u0027re doing your job, but this is a matter of life and death. I\u0027m calling from a pay phone. I\u0027m going to give you the number. Please have the senator call me.\" She gave the secretary the number and heard the secretary slam the phone down. Kelly said, \"What do we do now?\" we wait. They waited for two hours, and finally Diane said, \"It\u0027s not going to work. Let\u0027s-\" The phone rang. Diane took a deep breath and rushed to pick it up. \"Hello?\" An annoyed female voice said, \"This is Senator Van Luven. Who is this?\" Diane held the phone toward Kelly, so that they could both hear what the senator was saying. Diane was so choked up, she could hardly speak. \"Senator, my name is Diane Stevens. I\u0027m here with Kelly Harris. Do you know who we are?\" \"No, I don\u0027t, and I\u0027m afraid I-\" \"Our husbands were murdered on their way to meet with you.\" There was a gasp. \"Oh, my God. Richard Stevens and Mark Harris.\" \"Yes.\" \"Your husbands made an appointment to meet with me, but my secretary received a call saying that they had changed their plans. Then they-died.\" \"That call was not from them, Senator,\" Diane said. \"They were murdered to stop them from seeing you.\" \"What?\" She sounded in shock. \"Why would anyone-?\" \"They were killed to prevent them from talking to you. Kelly and I would like to come to Washington and tell you what our husbands were trying to tell you.\" There was a brief hesitation. \"I\u0027ll meet with you, but not in my office. It\u0027s too public. If what you\u0027re saying is true, it could be dangerous. I have a home in Southampton, Long Island. I can meet you there. Where are you calling from?\" \"Denver.\" \"Just a moment.\" Three minutes later, the senator came back on the line. \"The next flight out of Denver to New York is a red-eye. It\u0027s a United flight, nonstop to La Guardia. It leaves at twelve-twenty-five a.m. and arrives in New York at six-oh-nine a.m. If the flight is full, there\u0027s one-\" \"We\u0027ll be on that flight.\" Kelly looked at Diane, surprised. \"Diane, what if we can\u0027t get-?\" Diane held up a reassuring hand. \"We\u0027ll be on it.\" \"When you get to the airport, a gray Lincoln Town Car will be waiting for you. Go right to the car. The driver is Asian. His name is Kunio, K-U-N-I-O. He\u0027ll take you to my home. I\u0027ll be waiting for you there.\" \"Thank you, Senator.\" Diane replaced the receiver and took a deep breath. She turned to Kelly. \"We\u0027re all set.\" Kelly said, \"How do you know we can get on that flight?\" \"I have a plan.\" THE CONCIERGE AT the hotel arranged a rental car, and in forty-five minutes, Diane and Kelly were on their way to the airport. Kelly said, \"I don\u0027t know whether I\u0027m more excited or more frightened.\" \"I don\u0027t think we have anything to be frightened about anymore.\" \"It looks like a lot of people tried to meet with the senator, but none of them made it, Diane. They were all killed first.\" \"Then we\u0027re going to be the first to make it.\" Kelly said, \"I wish we had-\" \"I know. A weapon. You said that. We have our wits.\" \"Yeah. I wish we had a weapon.\" Kelly looked out the car window. \"Pull over.\" Diane pulled over to the curb. \"What is it?\" \"There\u0027s something I have to do.\" They had stopped in front of a beauty parlor. Kelly opened the car door. Diane said, \"Where are you going?\" \"I\u0027m going to get a new hairdo.\" Diane said, \"You\u0027re joking.\" \"No, I\u0027m not.\" \"You\u0027re getting a new hairdo now! Kelly, we\u0027re on our way to the airport, to catch a plane, and there\u0027s no time to-\" \"Diane, you never know what\u0027s going to happen. And in case I should die, I want to look pretty.\" Diane sat there, speechless, as Kelly walked into the beauty parlor. TWENTY MINUTES LATER, Kelly came out. She was wearing a black wig that was a luxurious upsweep piled high in the back. \"I\u0027m ready,\" Kelly said. \"Let\u0027s go kick some ass.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark/page-41.html","bookId":2370,"book":{"id":2370,"title":"Are You Afraid of the Dark?","description":"Storyline: The new novel that Sidney Sheldon\u0027s millions of fans all over the world have been waiting for.
