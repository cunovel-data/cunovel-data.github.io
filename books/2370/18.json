{"id":69681,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"ANDREW WAS IN his office, looking at a colorful booklet that the Nobel Committee had sent him, along with a note: \"We\u0027re looking forward to your arrival.\" There were pictures of the huge Stockholm concert hall, with the audience applauding a Nobel laureate as he walked across the stage to receive his award from King Carl XVI Gustav of Sweden. And soon I\u0027ll be up there, Andrew thought.\\n\\n The door opened and Tanner walked in. \"We have to talk.\" Andrew set the booklet aside. \"Yes, Tanner?\" Tanner took a deep breath. \"I\u0027ve just committed Kingsley Group to assist the army in an experiment they\u0027re conducting.\" \"You what?\" \"The test involves cryogenics. They need your help.\" Andrew shook his head. \"No. I can\u0027t get involved in that, Tanner. This isn\u0027t the sort of thing we\u0027re doing here.\" \"This isn\u0027t about money, Andrew. This is about the defense of the United States of America. It\u0027s very important to the army. You\u0027d be doing this for your country. Pro bono. They need you.\" Tanner spent another hour persuading him. Finally, Andrew gave in. \"All right.\\n\\n But this is the last time we get off the track, Tanner. Agreed?\" Tanner smiled. \"Agreed. I can\u0027t tell you how proud I am of you.\"\\n\\n HE CALLED PRINCESS and left a message on her voice mail. \"I\u0027m back, darling. We have a very important experiment coming up. I\u0027ll call you when it\u0027s over. I love you.\"\\n\\n TWO ARMY TECHNICIANS arrived to brief Andrew on the progress they had made so far. Andrew had been reluctant at first, but as they discussed the project, Andrew became more and more excited.\\n\\n If the problems could be solved, it would be a major breakthrough.\\n\\n An hour later, Andrew watched as an army truck drove through the gates of Kingsley Group, escorted by two army staff cars, carrying armed soldiers. He went out to meet the colonel in charge of the cadre.\\n\\n \"Here it is, Mr. Kingsley. What do we do with it?\" \"I\u0027ll handle it from here,\" Andrew said. \"Just unload it and we\u0027ll take over.\" \"Yes, sir.\" The colonel turned to two soldiers standing at the rear of the truck. \"Let\u0027s unload it. And be careful. I mean very careful.\" The men reached inside the truck and gingerly brought out a small, heavy-duty metallic carrying case.\\n\\n Within minutes, two staff assistants were carrying the case into a laboratory, under Andrew\u0027s supervision.\\n\\n \"On that table,\" he said, \"very gently.\" He watched as they set it down. \"Fine.\" \"One of us could have carried it. It\u0027s very light.\" \"You wouldn\u0027t believe how heavy it is,\" Andrew told them.\\n\\n The two assistants looked at him, puzzled. \"What?\" Andrew shook his head. \"Never mind.\" Two expert chemists, Perry Stanford and Harvey Walker, had been selected to work on the project with Andrew.\\n\\n The two men had already donned the heavy protective suits that were required for the experiment.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll get suited up,\" Andrew said. \"Be right back.\" He walked down the corridor to a closed door and opened it. Inside were racks holding full chemical gear resembling space suits, along with gas masks, goggles, special shoes, and heavy gloves.\\n\\n Andrew walked into the room to put on his suit, and Tanner was there to wish him luck.\\n\\n WHEN ANDREW RETURNED to the laboratory, Stanford and Walker were waiting. The three men meticulously sealed the room so that it was airtight, then carefully secured the door. They could all feel the excitement in the air.\\n\\n \"All set?\"\\n\\n Stanford nodded. \"Ready.\"\\n\\n Walker said, \"Ready.\"\\n\\n \"Masks.\"\\n\\n They donned their protective gas masks.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s begin,\" Andrew said. He cautiously lifted the lid from the metallic box.\\n\\n Inside were six small vials fitted snugly into protective cushions. \"Be careful,\" he warned. \"These genies are two hundred twenty-two degrees below zero.\" His voice was muffled by the gas mask.\\n\\n Stanford and Walker watched as Andrew gently lifted the first vial and opened it. It began hissing, and steam rising from the vial turned into a freezing cloud that seemed to saturate the room.\\n\\n \"All right,\" Andrew said. \"Now, the first thing we have to do?the first thing-\" His eyes widened.\\n\\n He was choking, his face turning chalky white. He tried to speak, but no words came out.\\n\\n Stanford and Walker watched in horror as Andrew\u0027s body tumbled to the floor.\\n\\n Walker hastily capped the vial and closed the case. Stanford hurried to the wall and pressed a button that activated a giant fan that swept the frigid gas vapor out of the lab.\\n\\n When the air was clear, the two scientists opened the door and hurriedly carried Andrew outside.\\n\\n Tanner, walking down the hallway, saw what was happening and a panicky look came over his face.\\n\\n He ran over to the two men and looked down at his brother. \"What the hell is going on?\" Stanford said, \"There\u0027s been an accident and-\" \"What kind of accident?\" Tanner was screaming like a madman. \"What have you done to my brother?\" People were starting to gather around. \"Call 911. Never mind. We haven\u0027t time for that. We\u0027ll get him to the hospital in one of our cars.\"\\n\\n TWENTY MINUTES LATER, Andrew was lying on a gurney in a room of the emergency ward at St. Vincent\u0027s Hospital in Manhattan. There was a pulsating oxygen mask on his face and an IV in his arm. Two doctors were hovering over him.\\n\\n Tanner was frantically pacing up and down. \"You\u0027ve got to take care of whatever is wrong,\" he yelled. \"Now!\" One of the doctors said, \"Mr. Kingsley, I must ask you to leave the room.\" \"No,\" Tanner shouted. \"I\u0027m staying right here with my brother.\" He walked over to the gurney where Andrew was lying, unconscious, and took his hand and squeezed it. \"Come on, bro. Wake up. We need you.\" There was no response.\\n\\n Tears filled Tanner\u0027s eyes. \"You\u0027re going to be fine. Don\u0027t worry. We\u0027re going to fly in the best doctors in the world. You\u0027re going to get well.\" He turned to the doctors. \"I want a private suite and twenty-four-hour private nurses, and I want a cot put in his room. I\u0027m staying with him.\" \"Mr. Kingsley, we\u0027d like to finish our examination.\" Tanner said defiantly,\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be waiting in the hall.\"\\n\\n ANDREW WAS RUSHED downstairs for a number of MRI and CAT scans as well as extensive blood work. A more sophisticated scan, a PET scan, was scheduled. Afterward, he was moved to a suite where three doctors were tending him.\\n\\n Tanner was in the hallway, sitting in a chair, waiting. When one of the doctors finally came out of Andrew\u0027s room, Tanner leaped to his feet. \"He\u0027s going to be all right, isn\u0027t he?\" The doctor hesitated. \"We\u0027re transferring him immediately to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, in Washington, for further diagnosis, but frankly, Mr. Kingsley, we don\u0027t have much hope.\" \"What the hell are you talking about?\" Tanner was yelling. \"Of course he\u0027s going to get well. He was in that lab only a few minutes.\" The doctor was about to reprimand him, but he looked up, and Tanner\u0027s eyes were filled with tears.\\n\\n Tanner rode to Washington in the ambulance plane with his unconscious brother.\\n\\n He kept reassuring him during the entire flight. \"The doctors say you\u0027re going to be fine?\\n\\n They\u0027re going to give you something to make you well?All you need is a little rest.\" Tanner put his arms around his brother. \"You\u0027ve got to get well in time for us to go to Sweden to pick up your Nobel Prize.\"\\n\\n FOR THE NEXT three days, Tanner slept on a cot in Andrew\u0027s room and stayed by his brother\u0027s side as much as the doctors would allow it. Tanner was in the waiting room at Walter Reed when one of the attending doctors approached him.\\n\\n \"How is he doing?\" Tanner asked. \"Is he-?\" He saw the expression on the doctor\u0027s face. \"What is it?\" \"I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s very bad. Your brother is lucky to be alive. Whatever that experimental gas was, it was extremely toxic.\" \"We can bring in doctors from-\" \"It\u0027s no use. I\u0027m afraid the toxins have already affected your brother\u0027s brain cells.\" Tanner winced. \"But isn\u0027t there a cure for-for what he has?\" The doctor said caustically, \"Mr. Kingsley, the army doesn\u0027t even have a name for it yet, and you want to know if there\u0027s a cure? No. I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m afraid he\u0027s-he\u0027s never going to be himself again.\" Tanner stood there, his fists clenched, his face white.\\n\\n \"Your brother\u0027s awake now. You can go in and see him, but only for a few minutes.\" When Tanner walked into Andrew\u0027s hospital room, Andrew\u0027s eyes were open. He stared at his visitor, a blank expression on his face.\\n\\n The phone rang and Tanner moved to answer it. It was General Barton. \"I\u0027m terribly sorry about what happened to-\" \"You bastard! You told me that my brother wouldn\u0027t be in any danger.\" \"I don\u0027t know what went wrong, but I assure you-\" Tanner slammed down the receiver. He heard his brother\u0027s voice and turned.\\n\\n \"Where-where am I?\" Andrew mumbled.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re at Walter Reed hospital, in Washington.\" \"Why? Who\u0027s sick?\" \"You are, Andrew.\" \"What happened?\" \"Something went wrong with the experiment.\" \"I don\u0027t remember-\" \"It\u0027s all right. Don\u0027t worry. You\u0027ll be taken care of. I\u0027ll see to it.\" Tanner watched Andrew\u0027s eyes close.\\n\\n He took one last look at his brother lying in bed and left the room.\\n\\n PRINCESS SENT FLOWERS to the hospital. Tanner planned to call her, but his secretary said,\\n\\n \"Oh, she phoned. She had to go out of town. She\u0027ll call you as soon as she returns. She said to tell you that she loves you.\" A week later, Andrew and Tanner were back in New York. Word about what had happened to Andrew had raced through Kingsley Group. Without him in charge, would the think tank continue to exist?\\n\\n When the news of the accident became public, it was sure to damage Kingsley Group\u0027s reputation.\\n\\n That doesn\u0027t matter, Tanner thought. I\u0027m going to make this the biggest think tank in the world. Now I can give Princess more than she ever dreamed of. In a few yearsTanner\u0027s secretary buzzed. \"There\u0027s a limousine driver here to see you, Mr.\\n\\n Kingsley.\"\\n\\n Tanner was puzzled. \"Send him in.\" A uniformed chauffeur walked in, holding an envelope. \"Tanner Kingsley?\" \"Yes.\" \"I was asked to deliver this to you personally.\" He handed Tanner the envelope and left.\\n\\n Tanner looked at it and grinned. He recognized Princess\u0027s handwriting. She had planned some kind of surprise for him. Eagerly, he opened the envelope. The note read:\\n\\n It isn\u0027t going to work, my dearest. Right now I need more than you can give me, so I\u0027m marrying someone who is able to do that. I love you and always will. I know you will find this hard to believe, but what I am doing is for the good of both of us.\\n\\n Tanner\u0027s face had gone pale. He stared at the note for a long time and then dropped it nervelessly into the wastebasket. His triumph had come one day too late. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark/page-18.html","bookId":2370,"book":{"id":2370,"title":"Are You Afraid of the Dark?","description":"Storyline: The new novel that Sidney Sheldon\u0027s millions of fans all over the world have been waiting for.
