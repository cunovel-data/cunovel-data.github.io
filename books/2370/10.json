{"id":69673,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"THE SOUND OF the plane buzzing low overhead brought a smile to Lois Reynolds\u0027s lips. Gary. He was late. Lois had offered to go to the airport to meet him, but he had said,\n \"Don\u0027t bother, sis. I\u0027ll take a taxi.\"\n \"But, Gary, I\u0027ll be glad to-\" \"It will be better if you stay home and wait for me there.\" \"Whatever you say, bro.\"\n HER BROTHER HAD always been the most important person in Lois\u0027s life. Her growing-up years, in Kelowna, had been a nightmare. From the time Lois was a young girl, she felt that the world was against her: glamour magazines, fashion models, female movie stars-and just because she was a little plump. Where was it written that buxom girls could not be just as beautiful as sickly-looking, skinny girls?\n Lois Reynolds would constantly study her reflection in the mirror. She had long blonde hair, blue eyes, delicate pale features, and what Lois considered a pleasantly full-figured body.\n Men can go around with their beer bellies hanging over their pants and no one says a word. But let a woman put on a few pounds and she\u0027s an object of scorn. What male moron had the right to decide that the ideal woman s figure should be 36-26-36?\n For as long as Lois could remember, her schoolmates had mocked her behind her back-\"fat ass,\" \"tubby,\" \"porky.\" The words hurt deeply. But Gary had always been there to defend her.\n By the time Lois had graduated from the University of Toronto, she had had enough of the teasing.\n If Mr. Wonderful is looking for a real woman, I\u0027m here.\n AND ONE DAY, unexpectedly, Mr. Wonderful appeared. His name was Henry Lawson.\n They met at a church social, and Lois was immediately attracted to him. He was tall, thin, and blond, with a face that seemed always ready to smile and a disposition that matched it. His father was the minister of the church. Lois spent most of her time at the social with Henry, and while they were talking, she learned that he owned a successful nursery and was a nature lover.\n \"If you\u0027re not busy tomorrow night,\" he said, \"I\u0027d like to take you to dinner.\" There was no hesitation on Lois\u0027s part. \"Yes, thank you.\" Henry Lawson took her to the popular Sassafraz, one of the finest restaurants in Toronto. The menu was tantalizing, but Lois ordered a light dinner because she did not want Henry to think she was a gourmand.\n Henry noticed that she was eating only a salad and he said, That\u0027s not enough for you.\" \"I\u0027m trying to lose weight,\" Lois lied.\n He put his hand over hers. \"I don\u0027t want you to lose weight, Lois. I like you just the way you are.\" She felt a sudden thrill. He was the first man who had ever said that to her.\n \"I\u0027m going to order you a steak, some potatoes, and a Caesar salad,\" Henry said.\n It was so wonderful, finally, to find a man who understood her appetite and approved of it.\n THE NEXT FEW weeks went by in a delicious series of dates. At the end of three weeks, Henry said, \"I love you, Lois. I want you to be my wife.\" Words she thought she would never hear. She put her arms around him and said, \"I love you, too, Henry. I want to be your wife.\"\n THE WEDDING TOOK place in Henry\u0027s father\u0027s church five days later. Gary and a few friends were there, and it was a beautiful ceremony, officiated by Henry\u0027s father. Lois had never been so happy.\n \"Where are you two going to honeymoon?\" Reverend Lawson asked.\n \"Lake Louise,\" Henry said. \"It\u0027s very romantic.\" \"That\u0027s perfect for a honeymoon.\" Henry put his arms around Lois. \"I expect every day to be a honeymoon for the rest of our lives.\" Lois was ecstatic.\n IMMEDIATELYAFTER THE wedding, they left for Lake Louise. It was a spectacular oasis in Banff National Park, in the heart of the Canadian Rockies.\n They arrived in the late afternoon with the sun sparkling over the lake.\n Henry took Lois in his arms. \"Are you hungry?\" She looked into his eyes and smiled. \"No.\" \"Neither am I. Why don\u0027t we get undressed?\" \"Oh, yes, darling.\" Two minutes later, they were in bed and Henry was making exquisite love to her.\n It was wonderful. Exhausting. Exhilarating.\n \"Oh, darling, I love you so much.\" \"I love you, too, Lois,\" Henry said. He stood up. \"Now we must fight carnal sin.\" Lois looked at him, confused. \"What?\" \"Get on your knees.\" She laughed. \"Aren\u0027t you tired, darling?\" \"Get on your knees.\" She smiled. \"All right.\" She got on her knees and watched, puzzled, as Henry took a large belt from his trousers. He walked up to her, and before she realized what was happening, he smashed the belt hard against her naked buttocks.\n Lois screamed and started to get up. \"What are you-?\" He shoved her down. \"I told you, darling. We must fight carnal sin.\" He raised the belt and struck her again.\n \"Stop it! Stop it!\" \"Stay there.\" His voice was filled with fervor.\n Lois fought to get up, but Henry held her down with one strong hand and slammed the belt against her again.\n Lois felt as though her backside had been flayed. \"Henry! My God! Stop it!\" Finally Henry stood up and took a deep, quivery breath. \"It\u0027s all right now.\" It was difficult for Lois to move. She could feel the open sores oozing. She painfully managed to get to her feet. She couldn\u0027t speak. She could only stare in horror at her husband.\n \"Sex is sinful. We must fight temptation.\" She shook her head, still speechless, still not believing what had just happened.\n \"Think of Adam and Eve, the beginning of the downfall of mankind.\" He went on.\n Lois began to weep, huge gulping sobs.\n \"It\u0027s all right now.\" He took Lois in his arms. \"It\u0027s all right. I love you.\" Lois said uncertainly, \"I love you, too, but-\" \"Don\u0027t worry. We have conquered it.\" Which means that will be the last time that happens, Lois thought. It probably has something to do with his being a minister\u0027s son. Thank God it\u0027s over.\n Henry held her close. \"I love you so much. Let\u0027s go out to dinner.\"\n IN THE RESTAURANT, Lois was barely able to sit down. The pain was terrible, but she was too embarrassed to ask for a pillow.\n \"I\u0027ll order,\" Henry said. He ordered a salad for himself and an enormous meal for Lois. \"You have to keep your strength up, my dearest.\" During dinner Lois thought about what had just happened. Henry was the most wonderful man she had ever known. She had been taken aback by his-what was it, she wondered-fetish. Anyway, that was over. She could look forward to spending the rest of her life taking care of this man and being taken care of.\n When they had finished their entrees, Henry ordered an extra dessert for Lois and said, \"I like a lot of woman.\" She smiled. \"I\u0027m glad I please you.\" When dinner was over, Henry said, \"Shall we go back to the room?\n \"Fine.\" When they returned to their room, they undressed and Henry took Lois in his arms and the pain seemed to disappear. His lovemaking was sweet and gentle and was even more enjoyable than before.\n Lois hugged her husband and said, \"That was wonderful.\" \"Yes.\" He nodded. \"Now we must atone for carnal sin. Get on your knees.\"\n IN THE MIDDLE of the night, when Henry was asleep, Lois quietly packed a suitcase and fled. She took a plane to Vancouver and called Gary. At lunch, she told him what had happened.\n \"I\u0027m filing for divorce,\" Lois said, \"but I have to move out of town.\" Gary thought for a moment. \"I have a friend who owns an insurance agency, sis.\n It\u0027s in Denver, and that\u0027s fifteen hundred miles away.\" \"That would be perfect.\" Gary said, \"I\u0027ll talk to him.\"\n TWO WEEKS LATER, Lois was working at the midwest insurance agency in a managerial position.\n Gary had kept in constant touch with Lois. She had bought a small, charming bungalow with a view of the Rockies in the distance, and from time to time her brother would visit her. They would have great weekends together-skiing, or fishing, or simply sitting on the sofa, talking. I\u0027m so proud of you, sis, he\u0027d always tell her, and Lois was proud of Gary\u0027s accomplishments as well. He had earned his Ph.D. in science, was working for an international corporation, and had taken up flying as a hobby.\n AS LOIS WAS thinking about Gary, there was a knock at the front door. She looked out the window to see who was calling and recognized him. Tom Huebner. He was a tall, rugged-looking charter pilot, a friend of Gary\u0027s.\n Lois opened the door and Huebner walked in.\n \"Hi, Tom.\"\n \"Lois.\" \"Gary isn\u0027t here yet. I think I heard his plane a little while ago. He should be here any minute. Would you like to wait or-?\" He was staring at her. \"You haven\u0027t been watching the news?\" Lois shook her head. \"No. What\u0027s going on? I hope we\u0027re not going to get into another war and-\" \"Lois, I\u0027m afraid I have some bad news. Really bad news.\" His voice was tight.\n \"It\u0027s about Gary.\"\n She stiffened. \"What about him?\" \"He was killed in a plane crash on his way here to see you.\" He watched the light go out of her eyes.\n \"I\u0027m so sorry. I know how much you loved each other.\" Lois tried to speak, but she was hyperventilating. \"How-how?how-?\" Tom Huebner took her hand and gently led her to the couch.\n Lois sat down and took deep breaths. \"What-what happened?\" \"Gary\u0027s plane hit the side of a mountain a few miles outside of Denver.\" Lois felt faint. \"Tom, I\u0027d like to be alone.\" He studied her, worried. \"Are you sure, Lois? I could stay and-\" \"Thank you, but please go.\" Tom Huebner stood there irresolutely, then nodded. \"You have my number. Call if you need me.\" Lois did not hear him leave. She sat there in a state of shock. It was as if someone had told her she had died. Her mind started flashing back to their childhood. Gary had always been her protector, fighting boys who teased her and, as they got older, escorting her to baseball games and movies and parties.\n The last time she had seen him was a week ago, and she saw the scene in her mind, unspooling like a blurred film through her tears.\n The two of them were seated at the dining room table.\n \"You\u0027re not eating, Gary.\" \"It\u0027s delicious, sis. I\u0027m not very hungry.\" She watched him a moment. \"Anything you want to talk about?\" \"You always know, don\u0027t you?\" \"It\u0027s something to do with your work.\" \"Yes.\" He pushed his plate away. \"I think my life is in danger.\" Lois looked at him, startled. \"What?\" \"Sis, only half a dozen people in the world know about what\u0027s happening. I\u0027m flying back here next Monday to spend the night. On Tuesday morning, I\u0027m heading for Washington.\" Lois was puzzled. \"Why Washington?\" \"To tell them about Prima.\" And Gary explained it.\n NOW GARY WAS dead. I think my life is in danger. Her brother had not been killed in an accident.\n He had been murdered.\n Lois looked at her watch. It was too late to do anything now, but in the morning she was going to make the phone call that would avenge her brother\u0027s murder. She was going to finish what Gary had planned to do. Lois felt suddenly drained. It was an effort to get up from the couch.\n She had had no dinner, but the idea of food nauseated her.\n Lois headed for the bedroom and fell onto the bed, too tired to undress. She lay there, dazed, until she finally fell asleep.\n LOIS DREAMED THAT she and Gary were on a speeding train and that all the passengers in the railroad car were smoking. It was getting hot, and the smoke made her cough. Her coughing woke her up, and she opened her eyes. She looked around in shock. Her bedroom was on fire, the blaze racing up the curtains, the room filled with smoke. Lois stumbled out of bed, choking.\n Trying to hold her breath, she staggered into the living room. The entire room was engulfed in flames. She took half a dozen steps toward the door, felt her legs give way, and fell to the floor.\n The last thing Lois Reynolds remembered was the flames hungrily licking their way toward her. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark/page-10.html","bookId":2370,"book":{"id":2370,"title":"Are You Afraid of the Dark?","description":"Storyline: \n The new novel that Sidney Sheldon\u0027s millions of fans all over the world have been waiting for.
