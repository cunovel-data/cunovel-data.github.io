{"id":69690,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"HARRY FLINT WALKED up to the reception desk of the Wilton Hotel. \"Hello.\" \"Hello.\" The clerk noticed the smile on his face. \"Can I help you?\" \"Yes. My wife and her friend, an African-American, checked in here a little while ago. I want to go up and surprise them. What\u0027s their room number?\" The clerk said, \"I\u0027m sorry. This is a hotel for women, sir. Men are not allowed upstairs. If you\u0027d like to phone-\" Flint glanced around the lobby. Unfortunately, it was crowded. \"Never mind,\" he said. \"I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll be down soon.\" Flint walked outside and dialed his cell phone. \"They\u0027re upstairs in their room, Mr. Kingsley. I can\u0027t go up.\" Tanner stood still a moment, concentrating. \"Mr. Flint, logic tells me that they will decide to separate.\n I\u0027m sending Carballo over to help you.\n UPSTAIRS IN THEIR suite, Kelly turned the radio on to a pop station, and the room was suddenly filled with loud rap music.\n \"How can you listen to that?\" Diane asked irritably.\n \"You don\u0027t like rap music?\"\n \"That\u0027s not music. That\u0027s noise.\" \"You don\u0027t like Eminem? And what about LL Cool J and R. Kelly and Ludacris?\" \"Is that all you listen to?\" \"No,\" Kelly said tartly. \"I enjoy Berlioz\u0027s Symphonie Fantastique, Chopin\u0027s etudes, and Handel\u0027s Almira. I\u0027m particularly fond of-\" Kelly watched Diane walk over to the radio and turn it off. \"What are we going to do when we run out of hotels, Mrs. Stevens? Do you know anyone who can help us?\" Diane shook her head. \"Most of Richard\u0027s friends worked at KIG, and our other friends-I can\u0027t get any of them involved in this.\" She looked at Kelly. \"What about you?\" Kelly shrugged. \"Mark and I lived in Paris for the past three years. I don\u0027t know anyone here except the people at the model agency, and I have a feeling they wouldn\u0027t be a lot of help.\" \"Did Mark say why he was going to Washington?\" \"No.\" \"Neither did Richard. I have a feeling that somehow that\u0027s the key to why they were murdered.\" \"Great. We have the key. Where\u0027s the door?\" \"We\u0027ll find it.\" Diane was thoughtful for a moment, then her face lit up. \"Wait a minute! I know someone who might be able to help us.\" She went over to the phone.\n \"Who are you calling?\" \"Richard\u0027s secretary. She\u0027ll know what\u0027s been going on.\" A voice at the other end of the phone said, \"KIG.\" \"I\u0027d like to speak to Betty Barker, please.\"\n IN HIS OFFICE, Tanner watched the voice identification blue light flash on. He pressed a switch and heard the operator say, \"Miss Barker is not at her desk right now.\" \"Can you tell me how to reach her?\" \"I\u0027m sorry. If you\u0027ll give me your name and phone number, I\u0027ll have her-\" \"Never mind.\" Diane replaced the receiver.\n The blue light went out.\n DIANE TURNED TO Kelly. \"I have a feeling Betty Barker might be the door we\u0027re looking for.\n I have to find a way to get to her.\" She frowned. \"It\u0027s so strange.\" \"What is?\" \"A fortune-teller predicted this. She told me she saw death around me, and-\" Kelly exclaimed, \"No! And you didn\u0027t report it to the FBI and the CIA?\" Diane glared at her a moment. \"Never mind.\" More and more, Kelly was getting on her nerves.\n \"Let\u0027s have dinner.\" Kelly said, \"I have to make a call first.\" She picked up the telephone and dialed the hotel operator.\n \"I want to place a call to Paris.\" She gave the operator a number and waited.\n After a few minutes,\n Kelly\u0027s face brightened. \"Hello, Philippe. How are you??Everything\u0027s fine here.\" She glanced over at Diane. \"Yes?I should be home in a day or two?How is Angel?.\n .. Oh, that\u0027s wonderful. Does she miss me??Would you put her on?\" Her voice changed to the tone adults use when talking to a small child. \"Angel, how are you, darling? ?It\u0027s your mama. Philippe says you miss me?I miss you, too. I\u0027ll be home soon, and I\u0027ll hold you and cuddle you, sweetheart.\" Diane had turned to listen, puzzled.\n \"Good-bye, baby. All right, Philippe?Thanks. I\u0027ll see you soon. Au revoir.\" Kelly saw Diane\u0027s bewildered expression. \"I was talking to my dog.\" \"Right. What did he have to say?\" \"She. She\u0027s a bitch.\" \"That figures.\"\n IT WAS TIME for dinner, but they were afraid to leave the safety of their room.\n They ordered something from room service.\n The talk was desultory. Diane tried to make conversation with Kelly, but it was hopeless.\n \"So, you\u0027ve been living in Paris?\"\n \"At.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Was Mark French?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Were you married long?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"How did you two meet?\" None of your damned business. \"I don\u0027t really remember. I\u0027ve met so many men.\" Diane studied Kelly. \"Why don\u0027t you get rid of that wall you\u0027ve built around yourself?\" Kelly said tightly, \"Did anyone ever tell you that walls are to keep people out?\" \"Sometimes they keep people locked in, and-\" \"Look, Mrs. Stevens. Mind your own business. I was doing fine until I met you.\n Let\u0027s drop it.\" \"Right.\" She\u0027s the coldest person I\u0027ve ever met.\n WHEN THEY HAD finished a silent dinner, Kelly announced, \"I\u0027m going to take a shower.\" Diane did not respond.\n In the bathroom, Kelly shed her clothes, stepped into the shower, and turned it on. The warm water against her nakedness felt wonderful. She closed her eyes and let her mind drift?\n She could hear Sam Meadows\u0027s words. You know, Mark s madly in love with you. He wants to marry you. I hope he doesn\u0027t get hurt. And Kelly knew that Sam Meadows was right. Kelly enjoyed being with Mark. He was fun, and thoughtful, and caring, and a great friend. That was the catch. I think of him only as a friend. That\u0027s not fair to him. I must stop seeing him.\n Mark had called the morning after the banquet. \"Hello, Kelly. What would you like to do tonight?\" Mark\u0027s voice was filled with anticipation. \"Dinner and the theater? Or there are some stores open at night, and then there\u0027s-\" \"I\u0027m sorry, Mark. I\u0027m-I\u0027m busy tonight.\" There was a brief silence. \"Oh. I thought you and I had a-\" \"Well, we don\u0027t.\" And Kelly stood there, hating herself for what she was doing to him. It\u0027s my fault for letting it go this far.\n \"Oh, all right. I\u0027ll call you tomorrow.\"\n HE CALLED THE next day. \"Kelly, if I\u0027ve offended you in any wayAnd Kelly had to steel herself to say, \"I\u0027m sorry, Mark. I\u0027ve?I\u0027ve fallen in love with someone.\" She waited. The long silence was unbearable.\n \"Oh.\" Mark\u0027s voice was shaky. \"I understand. I-I should have realized that we?Concongratulations. I really hope you\u0027ll be happy, Kelly. Please say good-bye to Angel for me.\" Mark hung up. Kelly stood there, holding the dead phone in her hand, feeling miserable. He\u0027ll forget me soon, Kelly thought, and find someone who can give him the happiness he deserves.\n KELLY WORKED EVERY day, smiling her way across runways and hearing the applause of the crowds, but inside she was saddened. Life was not the same without her friend. She was constantly tempted to call him, but she resisted. I can\u0027t. I\u0027ve hurt him enough.\n Several weeks went by, and Kelly did not hear from Mark. He\u0027s out of my life.\n He\u0027s probably found someone else by now. I\u0027m glad. And she tried to mean it.\n ON A SATURDAY afternoon, Kelly was working a fashion show in an elegant room crowded with the elite of Paris. She walked out onto the runway, and as soon as she appeared, there was the usual acclaim. Kelly was following a model wearing an afternoon suit and carrying a pair of gloves. One of the gloves slipped out of her hand and dropped onto the runway. When Kelly saw it, it was too late.\n She tripped on it and plummeted to the floor, falling on her face. There was a gasp from the audience. Kelly lay there, humiliated. Steeling herself not to cry, she took a deep, shuddering breath, raised herself up, and fled from the runway.\n When Kelly reached the dressing room, the wardrobe mistress said, \"I have the evening gown ready for you. You had better-\" Kelly was sobbing. \"No. I-I can\u0027t go out there in front of those people. They\u0027ll laugh at me.\" She was becoming hysterical. \"I\u0027m through. I\u0027m never going to go out there again. Never!\" \"Of course you are.\" Kelly spun around. Mark was standing in the doorway. \"Mark! What-what are you doing here?\" \"Oh, I-I\u0027ve kind of been hanging around lately.\" \"You-you saw-what happened out there?\" Mark smiled. \"It was wonderful. I\u0027m glad it happened.\" Kelly was staring at him. \"Wh-what?\" He stepped close to her and took out a handkerchief to dry her tears. \"Kelly, before you walked out there, the audience thought you were just a beautiful, untouchable dream, a fantasy, out of reach.\n When you tripped and fell, it showed them that you\u0027re human, and they adored you for it. Now you Go back out there and make them happy.\" She looked into Mark\u0027s compassionate eyes, and that was the moment Kelly realized she was in love with him.\n The wardrobe woman was putting the evening gown back on a clothes rack.\n \"Give me that,\" Kelly said. She looked at Mark and smiled through her tears.\n Five minutes later, when Kelly confidently walked out on the runway, there was a wave of thunderous applause and a standing ovation from the audience. Kelly stood there facing them, overwhelmed by emotion.\n It was so wonderful to have Mark in her life again. She remembered how nervous she had been in the beginning?\n KELLY HAD BEEN tense, waiting for Mark to make a pass at her, but he was always the perfect gentleman. His shyness made her feel more confident. It was Kelly who began most of the conversations, and no matter what the subject was, she found that Mark was knowledgeable and amusing.\n One evening, Kelly said, \"Mark, there\u0027s a great symphony orchestra opening tomorrow night. Do you like classical music?\" He nodded. \"I grew up with it.\" \"Good. We\u0027ll go.\"\n THE CONCERT WAS brilliant, and the audience enthusiastic.\n On the way back to Kelly\u0027s apartment, Mark said, \"Kelly, I-I lied to you.\" I should have known, Kelly thought. He\u0027s just like the rest of them. It\u0027s over.\n She steeled herself for his answer. \"Did you?\" \"Yes. I-I don\u0027t really like classical music.\" Kelly bit her lip to keep from bursting out laughing.\n On their next date, Kelly said, \"I want to thank you for Angel. She\u0027s great company.\" And so are you, Kelly thought. Mark had the brightest blue eyes she had ever seen, and an endearing, crooked, little smile. She enjoyed his company tremendously and?\n THE WATER WAS getting cold. Kelly turned off the shower, toweled herself off, put on the hotel\u0027s terry cloth robe, and went into the bedroom.\n \"It s all yours.\"\n \"Thanks.\" Diane got up and stepped into the bathroom. It looked like a storm had struck.\n Water had spilled onto the floor, and towels were strewn all over the floor.\n Angrily, Diane walked back into the bedroom. \"The bathroom is a mess. Are you used to having people pick up after you?\" Kelly smiled sweetly. \"Yes, Mrs. Stevens. As a matter of fact, I grew up with a lot of maids taking care of me.\" \"Well, I\u0027m not one of them.\" You wouldn\u0027t qualify.\n Diane took a deep breath. \"I think it would be better if we-\" \"There\u0027s no \u0027we,\u0027 Mrs. Stevens. There\u0027s you and there\u0027s me.\" They stared at each other for a long moment. Then, without another word, Diane turned and went back into the bathroom. Fifteen minutes later, when she emerged, Kelly was in bed. Diane reached for the switch to turn off the overhead light.\n \"No, don\u0027t touch that!\" It was a scream.\n Diane looked at Kelly, startled. \"What?\" \"Leave the lights on.\" Diane asked scornfully, \"Are you afraid of the dark?\" \"Yes. I\u0027m-I\u0027m afraid of the dark.\" Diane said patronizingly, \"Why? Did your parents tell you scary bogeyman stories when you were a little girl?\" There was a long silence. \"That\u0027s it.\" Diane went to her own bed. She lay there for a minute, then closed her eyes.\n Richard, darling, I never believed that someone could die of a broken heart. I believe it now. I need you so much. I need you to guide me. I need your warmth and your love. You\u0027re here somewhere, I know you are. I can feel you. You \u0027re a gift that God loaned me, but not for long enough. Good night, my guardian angel.\n Please don\u0027t ever leave me. Please.\n In her bed, Kelly could hear Diane quietly sobbing. Kelly\u0027s lips tightened. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.\n And tears began to roll down her cheeks. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark/page-27.html","bookId":2370,"book":{"id":2370,"title":"Are You Afraid of the Dark?","description":"Storyline: \n The new novel that Sidney Sheldon\u0027s millions of fans all over the world have been waiting for.
