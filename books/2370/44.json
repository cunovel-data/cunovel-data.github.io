{"id":69707,"no":44,"title":"Page 44","content":"KELLY WAS THE first to open her eyes. She was lying on her back, naked, on the bare floor of a concrete basement, her hands handcuffed to eight-inch chains fastened to the wall, just above the floor. There was a small, barred window at the far end of the room, and a heavy door leading into the room. Kelly turned to see Diane next to her, also naked and handcuffed. Their clothing had been thrown into a corner. Diane said groggily, \"Where are we?\" \"We\u0027re in hell, partner.\" Kelly tested the handcuffs. They were tight and firm around her wrists. She could lift her arm four or five inches, but that was it. \"We walked right into their trap,\" she said bitterly. \"You know what I hate most about this?\" Kelly looked around the bare room and said, \"I can\u0027t imagine.\" \"They won. We know why they killed our husbands, and why they\u0027re going to kill us, but there\u0027s no way we can ever tell the world. They\u0027ve gotten away with it. Kingsley was right. Our luck has finally run out.\" \"No, it hasn\u0027t.\" The door had opened, and Harry Flint was standing in the room. His smile widened. He locked the door behind him and put the key in his pocket. \"I shot you with Xylocaine bullets. I was supposed to kill you, but I thought we\u0027d all have a little fun first.\" He moved closer. The two women exchanged a terrified look. They watched Flint, grinning, take off his shirt and trousers. \"Look what I have for you,\" he said. He dropped his shorts. His member was stiff and turgid. Flint looked at the two of them and moved toward Diane. \"Why don\u0027t I start with you, baby, and then-\" Kelly interrupted. \"Wait a minute, handsome. How about taking me first? I feel horny.\" Diane looked at her, stunned. \"Kelly-\" Flint turned to Kelly and smirked. \"Sure, baby. You\u0027re going to love this.\" Flint reached down and started to stretch out on top of Kelly\u0027s naked body. \"Oh, yes.\" Kelly moaned. \"I\u0027ve really missed this.\" Diane had closed her eyes. She could not bear to watch. Kelly stretched her legs apart, and as Flint started to enter her, Kelly raised her right arm a few inches and reached into her upswept hairdo. When her hand came down, there was a rat-tailed comb with a steel tip five inches long in it. In one quick motion, she slammed the steel tail into the back of Harry Flint\u0027s neck, pushing its steel tip all the way through. Flint tried to scream, but all that came out was a loud gurgle. Blood was pouring out of his neck. Diane opened her eyes, stunned. Kelly looked over at Diane. \"You-you can relax now.\" She pushed away the limp figure on top of her. \"He\u0027s dead.\" Diane\u0027s heart was beating so fast it felt as though it was going to leap from her chest. Her face was ghostly white. Kelly was watching her, alarmed. \"Are you all right?\" \"I was afraid he was going to-\" Her mouth went dry. She looked at the bloody body of Harry Flint and shuddered. \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me about-?\" She pointed to the rat-tailed comb in his neck. \"Because if it hadn\u0027t worked?well, I didn\u0027t want you to think I failed you. Let\u0027s get out of here.\" \"How?\" \"I\u0027ll show you.\" Kelly stretched out a long leg to where Flint had dropped his pants. Her toes reached out to grab his trousers. Two inches too far away. She shifted closer. One inch too short. Then finally, success. Kelly grinned. \"Voila!\" Her toes clutched the leg of the trousers, and she slowly pulled them close until they were near enough to grab with her hands. She was going through his pockets, looking for the key to the handcuffs. She found it. A moment later, her hands were free. She hurried to free Diane. \"My God, you\u0027re a miracle,\" Diane said. \"Thank my new hairdo. Let\u0027s get away from here.\" The two women picked up their clothes from the floor and quickly dressed. Kelly took the key to the door from Flint\u0027s pocket. They walked over to the door and listened a moment. Silence. Kelly opened the door. They were in a long, empty corridor. \"There must be a back way out of here,\" Diane said. Kelly nodded. \"All right. You go that way and I\u0027ll go the other way and-\" \"No. Please. Let\u0027s stay together, Kelly.\" Kelly squeezed Diane\u0027s arm and nodded. \"Right, partner.\" Minutes later, the two women found themselves in a garage. There was a Jaguar and a Toyota in it. \"Take your choice,\" Kelly said. \"The Jaguar is too noticeable. Let\u0027s take the Toyota.\" \"I hope the key is-\" It was. Diane took the wheel. \"Do you have any idea where we\u0027re going?\" Kelly asked. \"To Manhattan. I don\u0027t have a plan yet.\" \"That\u0027s good news.\" Kelly sighed. \"We need to find a place to sleep. When Kingsley finds out we\u0027ve escaped, he\u0027s going to go crazy. We\u0027re not going to be safe anywhere.\" Kelly was thinking. \"Yes, we are.\" Diane glanced at her. \"What do you mean?\" Kelly said proudly, \"I have a plan.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark/page-44.html","bookId":2370,"book":{"id":2370,"title":"Are You Afraid of the Dark?","description":"Storyline: The new novel that Sidney Sheldon\u0027s millions of fans all over the world have been waiting for.
