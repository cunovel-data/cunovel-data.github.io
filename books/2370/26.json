A drought in Germany had caused at least a hundred deaths and had wiped out millions of dollars\u0027 worth of crops.\\n\\n Tanner buzzed for Kathy. \"Send this article to Senator Van Luven, with a note: \u0027Another global warming update. Sincerely\\n\\n THE WILTON HOTEL for Women was thirty-five minutes and a world away from the Mandarin.\\n\\n The Wilton was an attractive, modern-looking five-story hotel. An elegant, dark green canopy awning hung over the walkway leading to its entrance.\\n\\n In the lobby, Kelly and Diane were registering under false names. The woman behind the desk handed Kelly a key. \"Suite 424. Do you have luggage?\" \"No, we-\" \"It got lost,\" Diane cut in. \"It will be here in the morning. By the way, our husbands are picking us up in a little while. Would you send them to our room and-\" The clerk shook her head. \"I\u0027m sorry. Men are not allowed upstairs.\" \"Oh?\" Diane gave Kelly a complacent smile.\\n\\n \"If you wish to meet them down here-\" \"Never mind. They\u0027ll just have to suffer without us.\"\\n\\n SUITE 424 WAS beautifully appointed, with a living room containing a couch, chairs, tables, and an armoire, and in the bedroom two comfortable-looking double beds.\\n\\n Diane looked around. \"This is pleasant, isn\u0027t it?\" Kelly said acidly, \"What are we doing-going for the Guinness Book of World Records-a different hotel every half hour?\" \"Do you have a better plan?\" \"This is no plan,\" Kelly said scornfully. \"This is a game of cat and mice, and we\u0027re the mice.\" \"Right. When you think about it, the head of the biggest think tank in the world is out to murder us,\" Diane said.\\n\\n \"Then don\u0027t think about it.\" \"Easier said than done. There are enough eggheads at KIG to make an omelet the size of Kansas.\" \"Well, we\u0027ll just have to out-think them.\" Kelly frowned. \"We need some kind of weapon. Do you know how to use a gun?\" \"No.\" \"Damn. Neither do I.\" \"It doesn\u0027t matter. We don\u0027t have one.\" \"How about karate?\" \"No, but I was on the debating team in college,\" Diane said dryly. \"Maybe I can argue them out of killing us.\" \"Sure.\" Diane walked over to the window and looked out at the traffic on Thirty-fourth Street. Suddenly, her eyes widened and she gasped, \"Oh!\" Kelly rushed to her side. \"What is it? What did you see?\" Diane\u0027s throat was dry. \"A-a man walked by. He looked just like Richard. For a moment, I-\" She turned away from the window.\\n\\n Kelly said contemptuously, \"Would you like me to send for the ghost catchers?\" Diane started to retort but stopped. What\u0027s the use? I\u0027ll be rid of her soon.\\n\\n Kelly looked at Diane and thought: Why don\u0027t you shut up and go paint something.\\n\\n FLINT WAS SPEAKING on his cell phone to a furious Tanner. \"I\u0027m sorry, Mr.\\n\\n Kingsley. They weren\u0027t in their room at the Mandarin. They were gone. They must have known I was coming.\" Tanner was apoplectic. \"Those bitches want to play mind games with me? With me?\\n\\n I\u0027ll call you back.\" He slammed down the receiver.\\n\\n ANDREW WAS LYING on the couch in his office, and his mind drifted to the huge stage of the Stockholm concert hall. The audience was cheering enthusiastically and shouting, \"Andrew!\\n\\n Andrew!\" The hall echoed with the sound of his name.\\n\\n He could hear the audience applauding as he walked across the stage to receive his award from King Carl XVI Gustav of Sweden. As he reached for the Nobel Prize, someone started cursing him.\\n\\n \"Andrew, you son of a bitch-get in here.\" The Stockholm concert hall shimmered away and Andrew was in his office. Tanner was calling him.\\n\\n He needs me, Andrew thought happily. He slowly rose and walked into his brother\u0027s office.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m here,\" Andrew said.\\n\\n \"Yes, I see that,\" Tanner snapped. \"Sit down.\" Andrew took a chair.\\n\\n \"I have a few things to teach you, big brother. Divide and conquer.\" There was a note of satisfaction in Tanner\u0027s voice. \"I have Diane Stevens thinking that the Mafia killed her husband, and Kelly Harris is worried about a nonexistent Olga. Understand?\" Andrew said vaguely, \"Yes, Tanner.\" Tanner patted his brother on the shoulder. \"You\u0027re a perfect sounding board for me, Andrew. There are things I want to talk about that I can\u0027t discuss with anyone else. But I can tell you anything, because you\u0027re too stupid to understand.\" He looked into Andrew\u0027s vacant eyes. \"See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.\" Tanner was suddenly all-business. \"We have a problem to solve. Two women have disappeared.\\n\\n They know we\u0027re looking for them, to kill them, and they\u0027re trying to stay out of sight. Where would they go to hide, Andrew?\" Andrew looked at his brother for a moment. \"I-I don\u0027t know.\" \"There are two ways to find out. First, we\u0027ll try the Cartesian method, logic, building our solution one step at a time. Let\u0027s reason it out.\" Andrew looked at him and said vacuously, \"Whatever you say? Tanner began to pace. \"They won\u0027t return to the Stevens apartment because that\u0027s too dangerouswe\u0027re having it watched. We know that Kelly Harris doesn\u0027t have any close friends in the States because she\u0027s lived in Paris for so long, so she wouldn\u0027t trust anyone here to protect her.\" He looked at his brother. \"Are you following me?\" Andrew blinked. \"I-yes, Tanner.\" \"Now, would Diane Stevens go to friends for help? I don\u0027t think so. It might jeopardize them. Another alternative is for them to go to the police with their story, but they know they would be laughed at. So, what could their next step be?\" He closed his eyes for a few seconds, then went on. \"Obviously they would have considered the airports and train stations and bus stations, but they would know we\u0027re having them watched. So where does that leave us?\" \"I-I-whatever you say, Tanner.\" \"It leaves us with a hotel, Andrew. They need a hotel to hide in. But what kind of hotel? These are two terrified women running for their lives. You see, no matter which one they choose, they\u0027ll figure we might have connections there, and they\u0027ll be exposed. They won\u0027t feel safe.\\n\\n Do you remember Sonja Verbrugge in Berlin? We finessed her with that instant message on her computer. She went to the Artemisia Hotel because it was for women only, so she thought she would be safe. Well, I think Mesdames Stevens and Harris would feel the same way. So where would that leave us?\" He turned to look at his brother again. Andrew\u0027s eyes were closed. He was asleep. Furious, Tanner walked over to him and slapped him hard across his face.\\n\\n Andrew jerked awake. \"What-?\" \"Pay attention when I\u0027m talking to you, you cretin.\" \"I-I\u0027m sorry, Tanner. I was just-\" Tanner turned to a computer. \"Now, let\u0027s see what women\u0027s hotels there are in Manhattan.\" Tanner did a quick search on the Internet and printed out the results. He read the names aloud.\\n\\n \"The El Carmelo Residence on West Fourteenth Street?Centro Maria Residence on West Fifty-fourth Street?The Parkside Evangeline on Gramercy South, and the Wilton Hotel for Women.\" He looked up and smiled. \"That\u0027s where Cartesian logic tells us they might be, Andrew.\\n\\n Now let\u0027s see what technology tells us.\" Tanner walked over to the painting of a landscape on the wall, reached behind it, and pressed a concealed button. A section of the wall slid open, revealing a television screen with a computerized map of Manhattan.\\n\\n \"Do you remember what this is, Andrew? You used to operate this equipment. In fact, you were so good at it, I was jealous of you. It\u0027s a Global Positioning System. With this, we can locate anyone in the world. Remember?\" Andrew nodded, fighting to stay awake.\\n\\n \"When the ladies left my office, I gave each of them my business card. The cards have microdot computer chips about the size of a grain of sand imbedded in them.\\n\\n That signal is picked up by satellite, and when the Global Positioning System is activated, it pinpoints their exact location.\" He turned to his brother. \"Do you understand?\" Andrew swallowed. \"I-I-yes, Tanner.\" Tanner turned back to the screen. He pressed a second button. Tiny lights began to flash on the map and started downward. It slowed at a small area, then flowed ahead again. A moving pinpoint of red light swept along a street, going so slowly that the names of businesses were clearly visible.\\n\\n Tanner pointed. \"That\u0027s West Fourteenth Street.\" The red light kept moving.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s the Tequila Restaurant?a pharmacy?Saint Vincent\u0027s Hospital?\\n\\n Banana Republic?Our Lady of Guadalupe Church.\" The light stopped. A note of victory came into Tanner\u0027s voice. \"And there\u0027s the Wilton Hotel for Women. That confirms my logic. I was right, you see.\" Andrew licked his lips. \"Yes. You were right? Tanner looked at Andrew. \"You may go now.\" He picked up his cell phone and dialed. \"Mr. Flint, they\u0027re at the Wilton Hotel on West Thirty-fourth Street.\" He turned off the phone. He looked up and saw Andrew standing in the doorway. \"What is it?\" Tanner asked impatiently.\\n\\n \"Will I be going to-you know-Sweden, to pick up my Nobel Prize they just gave me?\" \"No, Andrew. That was seven years ago.\" \"Oh.\" Andrew turned and shuffled back to his office.\\n\\n Tanner thought about his own urgent trip to Sweden, three years earlier?\\n\\n HE HAD BEEN involved in a complicated logistics mishap when his secretary\u0027s voice came over the intercom. \"Zurich is on the line for you, Mr. Kingsley.\" \"I\u0027m too busy for-never mind. I\u0027ll talk to them.\" He picked up the phone. \"Yes?\" As Tanner listened, his face became grim. He said impatiently, \"I see?Are you sure? She?No, never mind. I\u0027ll handle this myself.\" He pressed down the intercom button. \"Miss Ordonez, tell the pilot to have the Challenger ready.\\n\\n We\u0027re flying to Zurich. There will be two passengers.\"\\n\\n MADELEINE SMITH WAS seated in a booth at La Rotonde, one of the finest restaurants in Zurich.\\n\\n She was in her early thirties, with a lovely oval face, bobbed hair, and a beautiful complexion. She was visibly pregnant.\\n\\n Tanner walked over to the table, and Madeleine Smith stood up.\\n\\n Tanner Kingsley held out his hand. \"Please, sit down.\" He sat down opposite her.\\n\\n \"I am happy to meet you.\" She had a lilting Swiss accent. \"At first, when I got the call, I thought it was a joke.\" \"Why?\" \"Well, you are such an important man and when they said you were coming to Zurich just to see me, I could not imagine-\" Tanner smiled. \"I\u0027ll tell you why I\u0027m here. Because I\u0027ve heard that you are a brilliant scientist, Madeleine. May I call you Madeleine?\" \"Oh, please, Mr. Kingsley.\" \"At KIG, we treasure talent. You\u0027re the kind of person who should be working for us, Madeleine.\\n\\n How long have you been with Tokyo First Industrial?\" \"Seven years.\" \"Well, seven is your lucky number, because I\u0027m offering you a job at KIG at twice what you\u0027re making now, and you\u0027ll be in charge of your own department and-\" \"Oh, Mr. Kingsley!\" She was beaming.\\n\\n \"Are you interested, Madeleine?\" \"Oh, yes! I am very interested. Of course I could not start right now.\" Tanner\u0027s expression changed. \"What do you mean?\" \"Well, I am having a baby and getting married? Tanner smiled. \"That\u0027s no problem. We\u0027ll handle everything.\" Madeleine Smith said, \"But there is another reason I cannot leave right now. I am working on a project at our laboratory and we are just getting-we are almost at the end of it.\" \"Madeleine, I don\u0027t know what your project is and I don\u0027t care. But the fact is that the offer I just made must be accepted immediately. In fact, I was hoping to fly you and your fiance\"-he smiled?\"or should I say your future husband-back to America with me.\" \"I could come as soon as the project is finished. Six months, maybe a year.\" Tanner was silent for a moment. \"Are you sure there is no way you can come now?\" \"No. I am in charge of this project. It would be unfair for me to walk out.\" She brightened.\\n\\n \"Next year-?\"\\n\\n Tanner smiled. \"Absolutely.\" \"I am so sorry that you had to make this journey for nothing.\" Tanner said warmly, \"It wasn\u0027t for nothing, Madeleine. I got to meet you.\" She blushed. \"You are very kind.\" \"Oh, by the way, I brought you a gift. My associate will bring it to your apartment tonight at six o\u0027clock. His name is Harry Flint.\"\\n\\n THE FOLLOWING MORNING, the body of Madeleine Smith was found on her kitchen floor. The stove had been left on and the apartment was filled with gas.\\n\\n TANNER\u0027S THOUGHTS CAME back to the present. Flint never failed him. In a little while, Diane Stevens and Kelly Harris would be disposed of, and with them out of the way, the project could ontinue. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark/page-26.html","bookId":2370,"book":{"id":2370,"title":"Are You Afraid of the Dark?","description":"Storyline: The new novel that Sidney Sheldon\u0027s millions of fans all over the world have been waiting for.
