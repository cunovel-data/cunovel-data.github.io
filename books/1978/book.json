But all of that was taken away in an instant. Now she\u0027s getting by as best she can, though sometimes that means doing things the old Nova would never do. Things that are slowly eating away at her spirit. Every day blends into the next . . . until she meets Quinton Carter. His intense, honey brown eyes instantly draw her in, and he looks just about as broken as she feels inside. Quinton once got a second chance at life-but he doesn\u0027t want it. The tattoos on his chest are a constant reminder of what he\u0027s done, what he\u0027s lost. He\u0027s sworn to never allow happiness into his life . . . but then beautiful, sweet Nova makes him smile. He knows he\u0027s too damaged to get close to her, yet she\u0027s the only one who can make him feel alive again. Quinton will have to decide: does he deserve to start over? Or should he pay for his past forever?","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/breaking-nova-nova-1.jpg","author":"Jessica Sorensen","type":"Young Adult","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":43,"category":{"id":9,"name":"Young Adult","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
