{"id":90740,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"\"Okay,\" Diana said. \"We don\u0027t have much time. Who has something to report?\" The Circle was eating lunch in their new spot, a small patch of woods up one of the narrow paths on the edge of school grounds - a green grass hideaway beneath the cover of high birches and leafy apple blossoms. Adam suggested it as their new lunchtime turf for the warm-weather months. All eyes turned to the Henderson brothers. They\u0027d had a mission this morning: to set off a stink bomb in third-period math. The plan was to be sent to the new principal\u0027s office together, where they could then tag team and look for evidence. The Circle was looking into anyone new in town, but the principal was number one on their list of potential hunters. \"Shouldn\u0027t we wait for Faye?\" Deborah asked as she unpacked her lunch. \"Lately all we do is wait for Faye,\" Melanie said. \"If she\u0027s got better places to be, then we should go on without her.\" \"I can hear you,\" Faye called out from the top of the path. She made her way down slowly. \"As I was saying.\" Diana raised her voice. \"Chris, Doug, did you find anything?\" Faye made it down the path just in time to nudge Doug in the ribs with her pointy black boot. \"Go ahead, say it. You came up with nothing.\" \"We came up with nothing,\" Chris said while Doug remained silent. \"But not due to lack of trying. Mr. Boylan seems like a pretty straight-up guy.\" \"I don\u0027t buy it,\" Nick said. \"He comes into town, and everything blows up. It\u0027s too much of a coincidence. We should question him, push the investigation further.\" Cassie noticed Nick was looking at her when he said it. \"There\u0027s no need to be reckless,\" Diana said. Nick guffawed. \"Yeah there is.\" Nick was immeasurably different from Adam, who was so righteous, always. Even his adventure-seeking was based in devotion; never for a moment was it a form of revolt. As Cassie watched Adam now, she observed how he scrambled around the group, always the mediator, trying to keep the peace above all else. The unity of the Circle meant more to him than anything. That was it. That was the thing rolling around in the back of her mind since they\u0027d argued the other night, the thing she couldn\u0027t quite put her finger on. But now that it occurred to her, it rang out with indisputable truth: Nothing came before the Circle to Adam. Not even her. As if her discreet competition with Diana weren\u0027t enough, Cassie realized she would also be eternally pitted against the Circle as if it were another woman - a woman with greater hold over Adam\u0027s loyalty. How could she have not realized this sooner? Diana, who\u0027d barely touched her salad, glanced at Adam now, and then cleared her throat. \"And has everyone been avoiding Outsiders, like we discussed?\" Cassie threw her peanut butter and jelly down onto her napkin. \"You don\u0027t have to be so vague, Diana, everyone knows which Outsiders you mean.\" Melanie and Laurel looked down at their lunches. Cassie\u0027s sudden and uncharacteristic insolence obviously made them uncomfortable. Suzan and Sean glanced at each other with widened eyes, and Deborah\u0027s face tightened. But Nick, Cassie noticed, was grinning, amused by her outburst. \"Catfight,\" Faye called out, rubbing her palms together. \"Now remember, ladies, no hair pulling.\" But Diana remained poised as always and revealed no defensiveness in her reply. \"That rule applies to all Outsiders equally, Cassie. It\u0027s not just about you being friends with Scarlett.\" Cassie felt her cheeks redden and her neck heat up. \"You have to believe me,\" she said with a shaky voice. \"There\u0027s nothing sketchy about Scarlett. Just because she\u0027s an Outsider doesn\u0027t make her against us.\" \"It doesn\u0027t?\" Faye said sardonically. \"You can\u0027t say that for sure,\" Diana insisted. \"We barely know anything about Scarlett.\" \"Yes, I can.\" Cassie was yelling now. \"I know what I see when I look at her. And I trust my sight.\" It was a low blow for Cassie to mention her sight - a reminder to Diana that it was Cassie alone who had the gift of psychic visions. \"Look out,\" Faye said. \"Cassie\u0027s bringing out the big guns.\" \"Your sight may be clouded,\" Diana said rigidly. But Cassie shot right back. \"Clouded by what?\" \"By the fact that you\u0027ve been obsessed with her since the second you met.\" Diana snapped at last, losing her cool. \"Aha.\" Faye clapped her hands together. \"Finally the truth comes out. Diana\u0027s jealous Cassie found a new best friend!\" A round of snickering passed through the group. Suzan and Deborah both nodded approvingly. \"A fault in the flawless marble that is our precious Diana,\" Faye said. \"I love it.\" \"I\u0027m not jealous.\" Diana settled her green eyes directly on Cassie. \"Yes, you are,\" Cassie said. Diana was rendered speechless by this final attack, but she refused to take her eyes away from Cassie\u0027s. Cassie wouldn\u0027t look away either. All the frustration and confusion and anger she\u0027d felt over Diana\u0027s rejection of Scarlett and her going to Adam behind her back seemed to be flowing out of her now. And right back at her came Diana\u0027s disappointment and outrage over Cassie\u0027s audacity to defy her and the group. It was a standoff of wills. Was this what they had resorted to? This petty face-off? Nobody moved or said a word, and for a second Cassie thought it could go on forever. But then, of course, Adam got between them. \"Let\u0027s move on,\" he said. \"We don\u0027t have much time and we still have lots to discuss. Diana, Deborah, tell us what happened when you followed Max.\" At the mention of Max\u0027s name, Faye lashed out, immediately furious. \"You did what?\" Diana had a new argument to deal with now, so she reharnessed all of her energy toward Faye. \"We haven\u0027t even accused Max of anything yet. No need to overreact.\" \"I have every reason to overreact. You went behind my back.\" \"He\u0027s an Outsider, and he\u0027s new in town,\" Deborah said. \"You knew he was on our list.\" \"And we followed him straight to your house,\" Diana said as calmly as still water. Shock broke through the surface of the group, cracking them apart into a fissured hysteria. This meeting was turning out to be much more volatile than anyone anticipated. \"He was at your house?\" Melanie\u0027s gray eyes flared. \"So that makes two people who\u0027ve been breaking the no-Outsider rule,\" Laurel said with a tinge of antagonism in her usually peaceful voice. Suzan blurted out with her mouth half full of Twinkie, \"But Max wanted nothing to do with Faye. He\u0027s been avoiding her for weeks.\" Deborah shook her head, disbelieving, \"Well, something changed. He\u0027s into her now. He dropped his whole I\u0027m too good for everyone thing and was pawing after Faye like a needy puppy. He even ditched lacrosse practice to be with her. It was almost like he was under a spell . . .\" her. It was almost like he was under a spell . . .\" As soon as Deborah uttered the word spell it dawned on her and everyone. Adam wielded his electric-blue eyes at Faye. \"You didn\u0027t,\" he said. \"Tell me you didn\u0027t.\" But they all knew. That\u0027s what Faye had been up to all this time, making her late to meetings and secretive about plans. Faye did a love spell to get her crush. \"You swore,\" Adam said. \"We all swore not to practice any magic.\" Faye waved Adam off with her long red nails as if to wipe him away from her sight. \"It was nothing. A simple love spell is hardly magic at all.\" Melanie went to Adam\u0027s side. She was angrier than Cassie had ever seen her. \"They\u0027ll find us now, you know. The hunters.\" \"Relax.\" Faye laughed. \"They\u0027re not cupid hunters. No one noticed. And no one will.\" \"But any slip could mean we\u0027re outed,\" Nick said. His hands were balled into fists, and his breathing was heavy. \"We can\u0027t afford to make mistakes.\" Faye whipped around and rushed at Nick. \"Why don\u0027t you tell that to Cassie?\" \"Cassie hasn\u0027t done anything wrong. You have.\" Nick squeezed his fists tighter. \"Are you sure?\" Faye shoved Nick forcefully in the chest. \"That\u0027s enough,\" Diana screamed out. \"This discussion is getting us nowhere, and we all have to get back to class. We\u0027ll pick this up later.\" But how? Cassie thought. How could they possibly pick up all these broken pieces? Everyone gathered their trash slowly and began making their way back to the school building, but Faye stayed put. \"Seriously? You\u0027re all leaving? The fun was just getting started.\" Melanie elbow checked her on her way back to the path, but Faye remained unfazed. She called out to Cassie, amused, \"I like the new angry version of Melanie so much better than the boring old reasonable one, don\u0027t you?\" Cassie ignored her, stuffing the remaining bread from her sandwich back into its paper bag. \"The new jealous version of Diana isn\u0027t bad, either,\" Faye continued. \"And the lying version of Cassie, well, that\u0027s not so new.\" It was what Faye wanted, to draw her into a fight, but Cassie couldn\u0027t ignore her any longer. She met Faye eye to eye. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about,\" she said. \"And I don\u0027t care, either.\" Faye reached out and caught Cassie\u0027s chin with her strong fingers. \"You should care.\" Cassie resisted the urge to pull away. The red stone Faye wore around her throat reflected the sunlight into Cassie\u0027s eyes, burning them, but she held her gaze. \"I\u0027m not afraid of you,\" she said through Faye\u0027s grip. \"One more of your many stupid mistakes.\" Faye squeezed her fingers tighter around Cassie\u0027s chin. \"Hey! Let her go.\" It was Nick at the top of the path. Laughing, Faye released her. \"This one can take care of herself, Nicholas. She doesn\u0027t need you saving her. Isn\u0027t that right, Cassie?\" Cassie climbed up the path to Nick\u0027s side as Faye shouted, \"You\u0027ll never be Adam, Nicholas. No matter how hard you try.\" Cassie looked down the path at Faye, feeling the fire in her gut rise to her throat. \"Faye, you\u0027re pathetic. And deep inside, you\u0027re weak, far weaker than me. Don\u0027t push me to prove it.\" Faye licked her bloodred lips and then slid her tongue seductively across her teeth. \"That\u0027s more like it,\" she said. \"Give me more of that dark side, Cassandra. That\u0027s what I want to see.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-divide-the-secret-circle-4/page-14.html","bookId":2098,"book":{"id":2098,"title":"The Secret Circle: The Divide (The Secret Circle #4)","description":"Storyline: For the first time since moving to New Salem, Cassie Blake feels normal.
