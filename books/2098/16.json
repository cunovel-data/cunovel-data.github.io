{"id":90742,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"The rain was only a drizzle, and although it was nighttime, people were out and about. Scarlett had invited Cassie out tonight. Of course Cassie declined, but she wished she didn\u0027t have to. That\u0027s just what Cassie needed to clear her head - she needed to see other people, non-witches. She decided to drive into town. Even if she couldn\u0027t join the crowds of people going about their normal lives, she could at least watch them from inside her Volkswagen.\n But she\u0027d barely made it to Bridge Street when the light rain amplified to a hammering downpour. Everyone out on the streets scrambled for shelter inside restaurants and stores; some hovered within doorways and beneath overpasses. Cassie was dry and safe inside her car, and she felt like she was inside a snow dome that someone had shaken up, submerged by the shuddering rain on all sides but also untouched by it.\n And then she suddenly felt stripped of that safety. Her heart started to pound in her chest, and she began to sweat. She felt like she was being followed, but she didn\u0027t see any cars behind her. She kept checking the rearview mirror, and all she saw was the wet darkness in her own back window. Still, she decided to take a detour, in hopes of shaking the feeling.\n With a sharp turn of the steering wheel, she veered onto Dodge Street, a secluded road that would lead her back to the turnpike. Cassie had to slow down to maneuver its many meandering curves, but when she stepped on the brake pedal, her foot emptily dropped to the floor.\n She tried again and again, but there was no use. Her brakes weren\u0027t working.\n The car suddenly felt to her like it was speeding up, an angry vessel set on racing her to her death. She couldn\u0027t stop it, and letting up on the gas pedal was only doing so much. Panicked, she gripped the steering wheel and tried to bear off to the side of the road, where maybe the grass would slow the car enough so she could jump out to safety.\n But the grass did nothing to reduce the acceleration.\n Cassie\u0027s only chance was to jump out while the car continued full speed ahead. Panicked, she clutched the door handle and pushed the door open. But before she had the chance to leap to the ground, the car smashed right into a giant, thick-barked oak tree.\n She blacked out for a moment, maybe longer. When she opened her eyes, she saw she\u0027d been thrown from the car, through the windshield. She checked her arms and legs to see if she could move them and searched her face for blood. Unbelievably, she was all right.\n But her car was totaled. Looking at it through the dark rain, it reminded Cassie of a crushed soda can, flimsily accordioned to the tree. It was a miracle to be alive.\n She stood up slowly, continuing to take inventory of her surroundings, and recognized that the evil feeling was gone. Whatever dark presence had been following her had disappeared, but Cassie couldn\u0027t shake the feeling that this was no accident.\n She welled up with tears then. It wasn\u0027t a miracle. It was the protection spell that had saved her.\n Cassie hated to do it, but she knew she had to. She checked her body and clothes for that awful ancient symbol.\n It reminded her of searching for deer ticks after a day out in the woods, except the consequences in this case meant ultimate death. She was relieved not to find one. Cassie may have nearly been killed tonight, but at least she hadn\u0027t been marked.\n With shaking hands, Cassie pulled out her cell phone to call for help. But out in the middle of nowhere, she couldn\u0027t get a signal. Cassie started to panic even more. She was stranded out here, a sitting target.\n Cassie never should have gone out alone, without telling anyone where she was going. She was naive to think the hunters wouldn\u0027t come after her again the first chance they had. There was no escaping them.\n Cassie couldn\u0027t stop shaking while she waited in the pouring rain, hoping a kind stranger would drive by. But every sound and shadow made her jump at the alternative, and she grew stiff as a silver car slowed to a stop before her. But then Cassie recognized the face inside. It was Scarlett.\n \"Oh my goodness, are you all right?\" Scarlett jumped out of her car and ran to Cassie, leaving the door open. \"Are you hurt?\"\n \"I\u0027m okay,\" Cassie said, breathing a sigh of relief at a familiar face.\n Scarlett hugged her close to her chest, nearly as stupefied by the sight of the crushed car as Cassie was.\n \"You could have been killed,\" she said. \"And you\u0027re soaking wet!\"\n She dashed to the trunk of her car and retrieved an enormous wool blanket. She wrapped it around Cassie and rubbed her arms until they warmed.\n Cassie was too freaked out by the accident to resist.\n \"You\u0027re okay,\" Scarlett said in a voice as comforting as the thick wool around Cassie\u0027s shoulders. \"I\u0027ll take you home.\"\n The next day at school, everyone was talking about Cassie\u0027s recent brush with death. It was like the accident brought her popularity points in a sick and twisted way.\n Even Portia Bainbridge made her way through the crowded hallway to catch a look at Cassie at her locker. She turned her thin nose up at Cassie and narrowed her cold hazel eyes. \"So glad you didn\u0027t mess up that pretty little face of yours when you flew through the windshield,\" she said.\n The thought crossed Cassie\u0027s mind: Could Portia have cut the brakes in her car, or was it one of her moose-head brothers?\n But Portia had retreated from messing with the Circle after their final blowout last fall. Since then she\u0027d been distracted by a new boyfriend and barely seemed to think about much else. And her brothers, Jordan and Logan, were both at college. Cassie would have heard if they\u0027d been back around the island.\n Just then, Sally Waltman stepped to Cassie\u0027s side. A head shorter than Portia, Sally still crossed her wiry arms with the fierceness of a taller, stronger person. \"She\u0027s been through enough, Portia,\" Sally said. \"She doesn\u0027t need your harassment on top of it.\"\n Portia scowled. \"Don\u0027t forget which side you\u0027re on, Sally.\n You don\u0027t want to start being confused for one of them, or you might get hurt.\"\n \"Let it go already.\" Sally forcefully took Portia by the arm and urged her away. \"Come on, we\u0027re going to be late,\" she said, and shot Cassie a look of apology over her shoulder.\n Sally standing up to Portia meant a lot, considering she\u0027d once been one of the Circle\u0027s most hated enemies. If the group\u0027s relationship with Sally could come this far, she didn\u0027t see why they couldn\u0027t be more accepting of other well-meaning Outsiders, like Scarlett. Not all of them were as vile as Portia. Why couldn\u0027t the Circle see that?\n At lunch, the group gathered at their spot in the woods and grilled Cassie for details. She told them about the bad feeling that came over her just before the accident and how her brakes failed, but some details she kept to herself. She was exhausted, both physically and emotionally, and she couldn\u0027t handle what their reaction would be if she told them about Scarlett showing up just after the crash.\n \"But were there any clues about who the hunters were that did this?\" Diana asked.\n \"No,\" Cassie said. \"None.\"\n \"I saw Portia harassing you at your locker this morning,\" Nick called out. \"She\u0027s been off our radar too long, I don\u0027t trust it.\"\n Diana looked doubtful but said, \"It couldn\u0027t hurt to consider Portia and her brothers possible suspects.\"\n \"And Sally Waltman,\" Suzan said.\n Diana\n shook\n her\n \"Sally\u0027s\n pretty\n straightforward with us. Of all the Outsiders, I think she\u0027d be the least likely to want to hurt us.\"\n \"You guys are getting sidetracked,\" Deborah said.\n \"These hunters are strong. Whoever they are, they weren\u0027t in town before now, or we would have known it.\" Melanie agreed. \"That ancient symbol didn\u0027t come from any of our old schoolmates.\"\n Adam had been pacing back and forth the way he always did when he was nervous. He hadn\u0027t calmed down since he learned of the accident. \"I still wish you could have called me,\" he said to Cassie. \"How\u0027d you even get home?\" Cassie hesitated.\n It was a simple question. There was no need for such a long pause, and the entire group picked up on it.\n Adam stiffened and turned accusingly to Nick. \"Did she call you? Were you the one to drive her home?\" Nick appeared blindsided by Adam\u0027s accusation, but he quickly mirrored Adam\u0027s aggressive posture with his own.\n \"No, she didn\u0027t. But I wish she had,\" he said.\n \"Stop it, both of you.\" Cassie didn\u0027t have a choice. She had to tell them the truth.\n \"I didn\u0027t call anyone to come pick me up.\" She paused, not wanting to go on. Cassie looked down at her shoes.\n Run, she thought. Just run away from this awful moment.\n But there was nowhere to run to, and she knew it. Almost inaudibly she said, \"Scarlett happened to drive by while I was stranded. She drove me home.\"\n Adam shook his head, sidestepping Nick, who\u0027d also dropped his bravado. Diana reached for a nearby tree to steady herself. They were speechless, but Faye had the words right at hand to announce what the whole group was thinking.\n \"Oh, yeah,\" she said. \"Scarlett just happened to drive by, finding you in the middle of nowhere. What a lucky coincidence!\"\n Cassie wasn\u0027t having it. The last person she owed an explanation to was Faye. She stepped to her, boldly. \"Why would she have helped me if she\u0027d been the one trying to hurt me?\"\n \"You\u0027re being stupid,\" Deborah said, not holding back an ounce of disgust. \"It can\u0027t be a coincidence.\"\n \"She\u0027s not being stupid,\" Diana said. \"Cassie\u0027s just blinded. She wants to see the best in Scarlett.\"\n \"Exactly. Which is just plain stupid,\" Deborah insisted.\n \"No,\" Cassie said. \"Scarlett is innocent, I swear.\" Diana frowned at her sympathetically. \"I\u0027m sorry, Cassie.\n But it\u0027s too suspicious that Scarlett would just happen to know where you were last night after the accident. This appears to be the proof we\u0027ve been looking for all along.\"\n \"It\u0027s the principal,\" Cassie shouted. \"I can feel it in my bones.\"\n Adam responded to Cassie softly, guardedly. \"We haven\u0027t been able to dig up a single suspicious thing on the new principal. He\u0027s clean, Cassie.\"\n Even Adam wasn\u0027t willing to side with Cassie this time.\n She could plead with him, with all of them, all afternoon, but it was useless - they\u0027d already made up their minds to not believe her. Cassie turned to Nick, desperately, thinking if anyone might back her up, it would be him. But Nick was stone-faced, unwilling to rebel against the status quo on this.\n Faye rose up and positioned herself in the middle of their huddle. \"I say we go down to the docks after school and have a word with Scarlett.\"\n \"We should do the witch-hunter curse on her,\" Deborah yelled out.\n Diana went to Faye\u0027s side, crossed her arms over her chest, and nodded. \"I agree,\" she said. \"Who\u0027s with us?\" An assemblage of hands went up.\n \"But we should have a full Circle to do it. Otherwise we might not be strong enough.\" Diana beheld Cassie in her gaze. \"So are we a complete Circle or not?\" Cassie turned to Adam. His eyes were filled with longing and love, urging her to trust them, to trust him. And she wanted to trust Adam, she really did.\n \"Cassie,\" Nick said. \"If Scarlett\u0027s not a hunter, the spell won\u0027t work on her. This could be your chance to prove yourself right.\" He smiled gently, giving a nod toward Diana and Adam. \"And prove them wrong.\"\n \"That\u0027s true,\" Melanie said to Diana. \"If we perform the curse on Scarlett and she\u0027s not a hunter, then she\u0027ll know what we are.\"\n \"I know that,\" Diana said with confidence.\n Cassie raised her eyes to Diana\u0027s. \"You\u0027re that sure,\" she said, \"that you\u0027d be willing to expose the Circle to a harmless, good-intentioned Outsider.\"\n \"I\u0027m that sure.\" Diana stared back at Cassie without anger or hatred, but with utter conviction.\n \"Then I\u0027m with you,\" Cassie said in a hushed tone, almost to herself. \"We\u0027ll go to the docks after school today.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-divide-the-secret-circle-4/page-16.html","bookId":2098,"book":{"id":2098,"title":"The Secret Circle: The Divide (The Secret Circle #4)","description":"Storyline: \n For the first time since moving to New Salem, Cassie Blake feels normal.
