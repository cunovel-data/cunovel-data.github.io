{"id":90747,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"Cassie went home during lunch to go over all her notes on the locator spell Constance had taught them. Since she\u0027d never actually performed the spell, the details of how it worked were fuzzy in her memory. Her notes went on for a few pages, but as far as Cassie could tell, the spell was intended to locate lost objects. Nowhere had she written about using the spell to find a lost person.\\n\\n Just then there was a knock on her front door. It was Adam; she should have known.\\n\\n \"I figured I\u0027d find you here,\" he said, following Cassie to her bedroom.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not avoiding the Circle,\" she said. \"I wanted to do some research.\"\\n\\n \"I know. You\u0027re off the hook anyway - everyone went home to gather stuff for the spell.\" He plopped down on Cassie\u0027s bed, beckoning her to join him.\\n\\n Did he really think this was a good time for a make-out session? Cassie sat beside him, holding her notes between them.\\n\\n \"Is this locator spell really going to work on a person?\" she asked. \"I didn\u0027t realize it\u0027s actually a spell to find your missing car keys.\"\\n\\n Adam removed the notes from Cassie\u0027s hands and placed them down on the nightstand. \"It might not work,\" he said. \"But it\u0027s possible it will. These spells can be used to said. \"But it\u0027s possible it will. These spells can be used to find lost people if those people really want to be found.\" Cassie felt her shoulders settle a bit. There was no question that Scarlett wanted to be found. \"But what if the hunters don\u0027t want her to be found?\" she asked.\\n\\n Adam frowned sympathetically. \"That could be a problem. But my guess is the hunters do want to be found, because they want us to go to them.\" Then his eyes filled with remorse. \"There\u0027s a reason they\u0027re keeping Scarlett alive, Cassie. Otherwise they would have killed her outright.\\n\\n We will find her. I promise.\"\\n\\n Cassie knew Adam was right. She kissed him softly on the cheek. \"I don\u0027t know how I\u0027d get through this without you.\"\\n\\n \"Luckily you don\u0027t have to,\" he said, as he went in for a kiss. For just a moment, the world felt right again.\\n\\n After school that afternoon, the Circle gathered under the bleachers just before the track-meet finals were set to begin. But Faye was nowhere to be found. Searching the bleachers for her, Cassie and Laurel weren\u0027t surprised to find that she wasn\u0027t alone.\\n\\n Crowds had filled in the bleachers on all sides of Faye and Max, but they hadn\u0027t noticed. Max was kissing her neck as Faye ran her nails down the length of his torso and tugged at his jeans like a hungry animal.\\n\\n \"So much for her laying off Max,\" Laurel said. \"But I guess once the love spell was done, it was done.\" Cassie nodded. \"But Faye\u0027s not under a spell, so what\u0027s her excuse?\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s Faye,\" Laurel said.\\n\\n Cassie noticed Portia walking toward them, or more like marching toward them, wearing a high-collared blouse that was the same shade as her straw-colored hair.\\n\\n \"Here comes trouble,\" Cassie said.\\n\\n \"Will you tell your disgusting friend to go get a room?\" Portia shouted. \"This is a track meet, not an R-rated movie.\"\\n\\n Laurel giggled. \"Portia\u0027s right. I think they might be scaring the children.\"\\n\\n She turned to Cassie. \"Do you want to go douse them with some ice water, or should I?\"\\n\\n Portia half-smiled. \"Thank you, Laurel. I always knew you were the most reasonable one in your little clique.\" Then glancing at Cassie, Portia added, \"Though the bar\u0027s been set pretty low.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll take care of it,\" Cassie said, already walking away.\\n\\n She\u0027d take any excuse to escape Portia.\\n\\n Laurel and Portia continued talking for a few minutes while Cassie did her best to pry Faye away from Max.\\n\\n \"No,\" Max whined. \"Where are you taking her?\" All the coolness had been sucked out of him.\\n\\n \"Say good-bye, Max,\" Cassie insisted. \"Faye has to go now.\"\\n\\n Faye struggled to cop one last feel of him before being hauled away. She grazed her fingers across his chiseled face. \"Be a good boy and stay here,\" she said. \"And later you\u0027ll get a reward.\"\\n\\n Max\u0027s strong features softened with boyish delight. \"Do you promise?\" he said.\\n\\n Faye blew a kiss in response as Cassie dragged her down below the bleachers.\\n\\n Once they were safely away from him, Cassie shook her head. \"I can hardly believe that\u0027s the same Max.\" Faye smiled. \"If you saw him with his shirt off, you\u0027d believe it.\"\\n\\n Below the bleachers, the Circle was almost done preparing the locator spell. Suzan and Sean stuck candles into the ground: one north, one south, one east, and one west. Nick ignited the wicks with his brass Zippo.\\n\\n Melanie tapped Cassie on the shoulder. \"Excuse me,\" she said, bumping her to the side. \"I\u0027ve got censers to light.\"\\n\\n \"Won\u0027t they smell the incense?\" Cassie asked, referring to the bleacher crowd above.\\n\\n \"No,\" Melanie replied, while clearing the ground\u0027s energy.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s only jasmine. If anything, they\u0027ll think someone\u0027s smoking something.\"\\n\\n \"Is everybody ready to begin?\" Diana called out, eyeing Cassie.\\n\\n She\u0027d taken Cassie aside after chemistry class to hash out what happened at their morning meeting. She tried to explain her position, that she wished to save Scarlett as much as Cassie did, but she had to balance that wish with her responsibility to the Circle. It isn\u0027t personal, she\u0027d said.\\n\\n Cassie assured Diana she understood. But it was personal.\\n\\n That\u0027s what nobody seemed to recognize. To Cassie this was all very personal.\\n\\n The sound of their schoolmates cheering above them indicated the track meet had begun.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re ready as we\u0027ll ever be,\" Laurel said.\\n\\n The group sat in a circle surrounding the candles as Diana instructed them to do. Then Diana placed a goblet of water within the circle.\\n\\n \"Everyone invoke the element of Water,\" she said.\\n\\n Cassie gazed into the goblet, imagining it contained the whole ocean, so blue and cold and deep that if she tried to stick her fingers inside it to reach its bottom, she never would.\\n\\n \"Power of Water, I beseech you,\" Diana said. And then, together as a group, the Circle softly repeated the incantation four times.\\n\\n That which is lost shall now be found\\n\\n Hiding places come unbound\\n\\n They stared into the goblet as Diana called out, \"Let the water show the location of Scarlett.\"\\n\\n At first there was nothing, just some ordinary water pooled in a fancy glass. The crowd above their heads cheered and rose to their feet, and the water stirred. It took a few seconds for it to go still again, but when it did, Cassie noticed her own reflection in the water becoming more pronounced. The shape of her own face, her round eyes and pouting mouth, sharpened to a pristine clarity. How frightened she looked to herself, how desperate. But soon that faded away and a new image emerged, with equal clarity. It was a broken-down house - the same house as the one in her dream, except now she could really see it, not just sense it.\\n\\n It was a rickety beach cottage, in what Cassie recognized as the classic Cape Cod style. It sat near the end of a long, desolate, sandy lane, with a large body of water on one side and tidal marshes on the other.\\n\\n I know this place, Cassie thought, but in the next moment, the image transformed into something else.\\n\\n What was it?\\n\\n The image was forming slowly, but she could swear it was a loaf of bread. Then the loaf separated into slices.\\n\\n Maybe she was just hungry, because as quickly as that image formed, it re-shaped into something else: It was the face of a man who appeared to be from the 1800s. He had bushy eyebrows and a thick moustache and wore a high collar. Cassie was sure she recognized this man, too, but from where?\\n\\n And then, finally, the image changed one last time - to a number. It flashed for only a second, almost too quickly to catch, but it was 48. It appeared to Cassie like a numbered white ball plucked from a lottery. Then the water blackened and became still.\\n\\n \"I think Scarlett\u0027s in Cape Cod,\" Cassie said, looking to the others for confirmation.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Adam agreed. \"In the town of Sandwich. It\u0027s in the northwest corner of the Cape.\"\\n\\n Cassie laughed to herself. Of course. Why hadn\u0027t she figured that out? \"But who was that man?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"I know I\u0027ve seen him before,\" Diana said.\\n\\n And then it was Melanie\u0027s turn to have a laugh. \"I just read The Scarlet Letter,\" she said. \"That was Nathaniel Hawthorne.\"\\n\\n \"It was probably a clue to a street name,\" Laurel suggested. \"Lots of the streets are named after old authors around there.\"\\n\\n \"Forty-eight,\" Adam said, typing it into his phone. \"Forty-eight Hawthorne Street, that\u0027s where she is.\"\\n\\n \"Well, what are we standing around for?\" Nick said.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s go get her.\"\\n\\n \"We can\u0027t,\" Diana said firmly. \"Cape Cod is outside the realm of the protective spell. It\u0027s too dangerous.\" Melanie, sensing that Cassie was about to explode, backed Diana up. \"We\u0027ll need all the power we can get if we have a chance at defeating the hunters,\" she said. \"We should wait to battle them here in New Salem, under the guard of the protection spell.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m done waiting,\" Cassie said. \"We can\u0027t count on the hunters sparing Scarlett for long.\"\\n\\n Before anyone had the chance to respond, there was a spine-chilling scream from the bleachers overhead. It immediately registered that this was not the right kind of scream to hear at a track meet. It was a grisly sound, pain and shock and horror all wrapped into one. It sounded like death.\\n\\n death.\\n\\n Cassie and the others hurried out to see what happened, but it was complete havoc when they emerged. They strived to see over the mad crowd of panic-stricken students and frantic teachers and parents.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a student down, on the bleachers,\" Adam said.\\n\\n Cassie caught sight of a head of straw-colored hair and instantly knew who it was. It was Portia Bainbridge. And she was lying right above where the Circle did their spell.\\n\\n \"She collapsed,\" someone from the track team said.\\n\\n Laurel elbowed through the crowd to see if Portia was still alive. She kneeled over her body, calling her name, and checked for a pulse. But it was no use.\\n\\n Portia was gone - as lifelessly stiff as Constance had been on the ground the night of the spring festival. And what was worse, what Cassie wished more than anything she hadn\u0027t seen, was the faint glimmer of the hunter symbol on Portia\u0027s shirt, just over the place where her heart would have been beating.\\n\\n Cassie didn\u0027t need to ask the others if they could also see it this time. She knew by their fright-stricken faces that they could.\\n\\n \"We need to get out of here,\" Melanie said, ghost-faced.\\n\\n \"Now,\" Diana commanded. \"Everyone to my house.\" Scattered around Diana\u0027s living room, the Circle tried to regroup. But they were reeling from Portia\u0027s shocking death, and their own near miss.\\n\\n Adam was walking in figure eights upon the hooked rug, gnawing on his fingernails. \"Don\u0027t you see what this means?\" he said. \"The hunters killed a human, thinking the source of the magic was coming from her. So they don\u0027t know who the witches are yet.\"\\n\\n \"They still don\u0027t know it\u0027s us,\" Faye echoed, from where she was lounging on Diana\u0027s sofa. \"After all this time. I told you so.\" There was a hint of triumph in her voice.\\n\\n Laurel cringed at Faye\u0027s insensitivity. \"But that was a huge price to find that out, don\u0027t you think? Portia\u0027s dead.\"\\n\\n \"Ah yes, more Outsider blood on our hands,\" Faye said mockingly.\\n\\n Suzan unwrapped a Twinkie she had buried in her purse and emotionally bit off its top.\\n\\n With her mouth full she mumbled, \"I was finally starting to not hate Portia, too. And then we go and get her killed.\"\\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t our fault,\" Deborah said. \"There was no way we could have known that would happen.\"\\n\\n Melanie disagreed. \"We knew doing a spell as powerful as that was a risk, and we willingly took that risk. Portia would still be alive if we hadn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n Until now Cassie had remained silent. Of course she felt responsible for what happened to Portia, but there wasn\u0027t time to dwel on it at the moment. She took control of the floor, hoping to channel the group\u0027s fear and anger, and even their guilt, toward the task at hand.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m as rattled as the rest of you,\" Cassie announced.\\n\\n \"This proves the hunters are strong and getting closer. And Scarlett is still being held hostage and tortured in a shack on Cape Cod as we speak. We have to act fast before she reaches the same fate as Portia.\"\\n\\n Diana began shaking her head before Cassie had even finished her sentence. \"I\u0027m sorry, Cassie, but we just can\u0027t risk it. We\u0027ll figure out another way.\"\\n\\n Melanie jumped right in to aid Diana in shutting Cassie down. \"We can\u0027t mess with these hunters. Look at what they\u0027re capable of.\"\\n\\n Faye appeared to be utterly enjoying herself. What was it that charged her up? Was it the brutal loss of human life, the fractioning of the group, or everyone turning on Cassie?\\n\\n She sat upright from her lounging position on the sofa.\\n\\n \"You had to know there was no way we would step right into the hunters\u0027 hands, right?\" She narrowed her snakelike eyes at Cassie. \"Not with this group of cowards, anyway.\" Nick rose up from his chair. \"Shouldn\u0027t we put it to a vote?\"\\n\\n \"No.\" Faye laughed. \"It\u0027s called veto power. Right, D?\" Diana looked down at her thin hands. \"It\u0027s called an executive decision.\"\\n\\n \"We can\u0027t go after the hunters in Cape Cod,\" Adam said.\\n\\n \"But what if we try to lure them back here to New Salem?\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s no time for that!\" Cassie lost her patience.\\n\\n Chris Henderson shot up and went to Nick\u0027s side. \"We should vote. Like we always do.\"\\n\\n \"I agree.\" Doug joined his brother and Nick in their small insurrection. \"Since when did you all become fascists? I say we go rescue Scarlett.\" Then directly to Cassie he said, \"I know what it\u0027s like to lose a sister. You shouldn\u0027t have to.\"\\n\\n \"And I trust Cassie\u0027s judgment,\" Nick called out. His jaw was tight, but his eyes were full of emotion. \"I\u0027m willing to take the risk.\"\\n\\n Cassie\u0027s heart was confused. How could her soul mate not understand her the way Nick sometimes did? Adam was standing there now, stubborn and overly protective, shaking his head no while Nick was willing to do whatever it took to support Cassie and rescue Scarlett.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not going to happen, boys,\" Faye said maliciously.\\n\\n \"We have the right to vote on it,\" Nick insisted, with Chris and Doug growing visibly more restless at his side.\\n\\n But even if they voted, it was clear who would win. After everything they\u0027d been through, Scarlett was still an Outsider to them. They would do anything to save Melanie\u0027s great-aunt, but when Cassie\u0027s own sister was in trouble, and they had a way to save her, they refused.\\n\\n \"Fine.\" Diana appeared flustered and a little annoyed by this mutiny. \"We\u0027ll vote. But the decision is the final decision for the Circle. And let me just remind you that - \"\\n\\n \"Save your energy.\" Cassie cut Diana off. \"I don\u0027t need your vote. I don\u0027t need any of you.\" She walked away, leaving a fracture in the Circle as she went. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-divide-the-secret-circle-4/page-21.html","bookId":2098,"book":{"id":2098,"title":"The Secret Circle: The Divide (The Secret Circle #4)","description":"Storyline: For the first time since moving to New Salem, Cassie Blake feels normal.
