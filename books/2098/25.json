But Cassie had come too far at this point to back down now; plus she\u0027d come prepared. She\u0027d spent the whole day studying her Book of Shadows, memorizing every spell her mind could hold that might help her get through this covert mission undetected.\n Faye had way too much fun with spells, so there was no way the garter was going to be left unguarded. Traceable or not, magic was the only way Cassie would be able to get her hands on it. But first she had to find it.\n Cassie was familiar with how to break into Faye\u0027s house through the basement. All she had to do was unhook the latch of the wooden cell ar door in the backyard and slip down to the cement floor below - the same way she knew Faye snuck in and out during all hours of the night.\n Once inside, Cassie looked around. The basement was dark and moldy, crowded with dusty crates and damp cardboard boxes. It crossed Cassie\u0027s mind that if Faye had snuck out tonight and returned through the cell ar door behind her, she would be caught. And to be caught by Faye was as good as being destroyed by Faye. Cassie glanced behind her to the closed door and then cautiously around the musty room. She had to keep going; there was no turning back now, regardless of the risk. Before she turning back now, regardless of the risk. Before she allowed her fear to get the best of her, she decided to try a summoning spell for the garter.\n Grasping the pendant of pink quartz around her neck, Cassie whispered the incantation she\u0027d memorized from her Book of Shadows, modifying it for her current purpose.\n Lost for now Soon to be found Ancient garter come unbound Nothing happened at first, but she waited patiently, circled the room, and repeated the words again.\n No luck. And she felt nothing. So she decided to try something stronger. It was also a summoning spell, but her Book of Shadows said this spell could track down the energy of an object rather than simply the physical object itself.\n For this spell Cassie had to focus extra hard. She closed her eyes and breathed deeply until she\u0027d centered herself to a meditative state. It took a few minutes, but soon her breathing took on a rhythm like a heartbeat. She let herself become immersed in this rhythm until she was overcome with the feeling that she controlled it, as if the pulse of life itself were under her command. When the words came, they started from deep within her belly.\n Guiding Spirits, I ask your charity Lend me your focus and your clarity Ancient garter, I summon thee Black to white, dark to light Show me your precious energy Cassie opened her eyes to find a glowing aquamarine light in front of her. It hovered, waiting for her to observe it, and then soared forward through the air, leaving a trail in its wake like a comet tail.\n Now this was what Cassie always imagined magic to look and feel like. She followed the aquamarine trail around the basement until it led her to the storage space beneath the stairs.\n Cassie was elated. This had to be the place.\n And then she heard something - footsteps above her head. She lost her breath and felt her whole body stiffen while she listened for the footsteps again. She stood perfectly still, scoping the basement\u0027s corners for possible hiding spots. Then she heard the sound again and realized it was only the wind from outside blowing against the wooden door. It was just a false alarm, thank goodness, but it was enough to break her concentration. The aquamarine light flickered.\n The space under the stairs was low and narrow and packed full with boxes. Cassie brushed her hands over a few of their damp surfaces to see if she felt any vibes coming from one over another. Careful not to make too much noise, she sorted through them until she noticed one box with a faint design on its side - a swirl similar to a Celtic knot. Hurriedly, Cassie lifted its flap and looked inside. There she found another box. A steel document box.\n In her excitement, she reached for it without thinking. It sparked at her touch, singeing the skin of her fingers.\n Of course Faye had it guarded. Cassie dug into her pocket and retrieved the obsidian crystal she\u0027d brought from home. Black like lava with sharp edges, the rock was the size of her hand and could easily be used as a weapon.\n But Cassie brought it for its ability to purify dark matter. She glided the crystal over and around the steel box to disable Faye\u0027s spell while whispering the words she\u0027d memorized:\n \"Darkness be gone, no shields are needed, purity enters and leaves here unhindered.\"\n And it worked. When Cassie tapped the box with her fingertip a second time to see if it drew a spark, it was cool and quiet to her touch. Confidently now, she popped the lid off the top of the metal box.\n But she didn\u0027t find the garter inside. Instead she found a note scrawled in bloodred ink that said, Nice try.\n Cassie slammed the box closed, furious. Typical Faye.\n Cassie was going to have to get crafty if she were to pull this off. She had to think like Faye.\n Faye was . . . what? Faye was . . . possessive, to say the least. She would only trust herself as the garter\u0027s security system. She must be keeping it close by. In fact, it probably never left her sight.\n Suddenly Cassie knew, beyond any shadow of a doubt, what she had to do next. She had to go to Faye\u0027s room, where she was sleeping, and find the garter there. That was the only place it could be, where Faye could protect it even as she slept.\n Now Cassie wished Faye had snuck out tonight, leaving her room empty. But Cassie knew it was time to act, not think. A silence spell would help with getting upstairs.\n \"From my chin to my toes, a mute silence grows.\" Cassie slid her fingers from her mouth down the length of her torso, across her arms and legs, all the way to her feet, feeling every inch of her go soundless beneath her touch. When she stepped forward, the feeling of her shoe touching the floor remained the same, but not a single hint of noise accompanied it. Even when she jumped up and down, no sound escaped from the motion. It was eerie but amazing.\n Like a stealthy thief in the night, she made her way up the main staircase, through the lavish living room, to Faye\u0027s bedroom door. She turned the knob and pushed the door open with assurance.\n The room looked the same as Cassie remembered it, but darker. Moonlight shined in from the wide window, but it was still difficult to see, and Cassie couldn\u0027t risk waking Faye with the beam of her flashlight. There were many red candles strewn about, but of course they were all unlit.\n Cassie waited a few seconds to let her eyes adjust, and then words she hadn\u0027t known before came to her.\n By the power of the sun, make the dark become light And give me sight to see at night\n Suddenly, Cassie could see in the dark as if she\u0027d slipped on night-vision goggles. And there Faye was, sleeping, snoring ever so softly. For a split second, Cassie felt a tenderness toward her - it was by far the most peaceful Cassie had ever seen Faye. She looked almost childlike, serenely curled up in her huge bed, surrounded by soft cushions and embroidered pillows. Her tangled, pitch-black hair cascaded down in long full curls, framing her face in such a way that Cassie could hardly remember what it was that made Faye so scary in her waking hours.\n But Cassie shook herself from the notion. She knew she was in a dangerous place, and Faye was like a sleeping dragon protecting a jewel. One false move, and Cassie would be -\n Before she could even finish her thought, the dust ruffle on the bed stirred, and out poked the head of an orange cat, followed by a gray one.\n Cassie had forgotten about Faye\u0027s bloodsucking kittens.\n They were fully grown cats now. No doubt with sharper teeth and claws than the last time Cassie encountered them.\n Cassie stood very still and watched the creatures slink out from beneath the bed. She may have been silent, but the cats could still see her and smell her. They sniffed at her toes, purring. The orange one pawed up her leg to the knee and then hissed. Then the gray one clawed at her foot and took a vicious swipe at the skin of her ankle.\n Glancing at Faye, she kicked the gray cat from her right foot, sending it tumbling across the carpet. But that only seemed to make the orange one angrier. From where it was perched with both paws upon Cassie\u0027s left knee, it leaped for her face, swiping its sharp claws at her cheek.\n No! Cassie screamed, but her voice made no sound.\n With a swift motion of defense, she grabbed the cat by the scruff of its neck. It cut at her wrist with its claws and bit through the skin of her hand. Blood dripped down from her fingers to the floor.\n She tossed the orange cat out of the room, closing the door in its face before it could take another lunge at her.\n Meanwhile, the gray cat had jumped up on the bed, needling at Faye\u0027s neck, trying to stir her awake.\n \"Ouch!\" Faye cried.\n And with the speed of a cat herself, Cassie bolted for Faye\u0027s closet, soundlessly shutting herself inside before Faye could detect her.\n \"Ow - what has gotten into you?\" Faye, fully awake now, scolded the gray cat.\n Out of habit, Cassie held her breath and closed her eyes from inside the closet.\n Faye got quiet again, but Cassie could hear the rustling of bedsheets. She was sure Faye sensed something was amiss. Explanations and apologies raced through her mind. If only she knew a spell to make herself invisible. That was the only thing that could save her now if Faye opened the closet door.\n But then Faye chuckled absentmindedly. \"That\u0027s better,\" she said. \"Now let Mama get her beauty rest. You can sleep up here with me tonight if you promise to be good.\" Cassie exhaled. That was too close. But when she reopened her eyes, the closet appeared different. An unusual aquamarine light was radiating from a piece of clothing hanging in the closet.\n The location spell had worked, and it was still working for her. The glowing light was hovering just inside Faye\u0027s favorite leather jacket, the one she wore every day in spite of the weather. Cassie rubbed her fingers over its soft leather and across the smooth red satin of its interior lining.\n Of course. Faye had sewn the garter into the jacket\u0027s lining. It made perfect sense.\n Cassie clawed at the red satin until she broke through its surface and tore it wide open. And there it was, resting in a bed of supple red satin - the green leather garter. Cassie was about to reach into the material to pluck it free when she remembered the sparks that burned her fingers earlier.\n She retrieved the obsidian crystal from her pocket once more and glided it over and around the garter to disable any spell Faye had on it. Then she was free to reach out and grab it. At last.\n The garter felt heavy and triumphant in her hand. She gripped it tightly, admiring its shiny buckles, hardly believing she\u0027d done it. She\u0027d really done it! But there was no time to celebrate. Cassie could hear the orange cat scratching outside Faye\u0027s bedroom door, and she had to escape before Faye woke up again.\n Soundlessly, she tried to patch the lining back into place, but without a needle and thread or the proper spell, it would be impossible. Faye would discover it missing in the morning - that was unavoidable. But it didn\u0027t matter. Cassie would be in Cape Cod by then, with the power of all the Master Tools along with her.\n She left the jacket hanging like a looted grave, slipped out of the closet, and across the bedroom floor. The moment she opened the door, the orange cat leaped in, but Cassie was down the stairs and out the way she came within seconds.\n It was only then, finally, that she let the reality settle over her. She now possessed all of the Master Tools, and the power she needed to save Scarlett, even without the help of the Circle. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-divide-the-secret-circle-4/page-25.html","bookId":2098,"book":{"id":2098,"title":"The Secret Circle: The Divide (The Secret Circle #4)","description":"Storyline: \n For the first time since moving to New Salem, Cassie Blake feels normal.
