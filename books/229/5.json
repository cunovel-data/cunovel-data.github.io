{"id":7054,"no":5,"title":"The Audiovisual","content":"In March of 1995, a limousine carrying Ted Koppel, the host of ABC-TV\u0027s \"Nightline\" pulled up to the snow-covered curb outside Morrie\u0027s house in West Newton, Massachusetts.\\n\\n Morrie was in a wheelchair full-time now, getting used to helpers lifting him like a heavy sack from the chair to the bed and the bed to the chair. He had begun to cough while eating, and chewing was a chore. His legs were dead; he would never walk again.\\n\\n Yet he refused to be depressed. Instead, Morrie had become a lightning rod of ideas. He jotted down his thoughts on yellow pads, envelopes, folders, scrap paper. He wrote bite-sized philosophies about living with death\u0027s shadow: \"Accept what you are able to do and what you are not able to do\"; \"Accept the past as past, without denying it or discarding it\"; \"Learn to forgive yourself and to forgive others\"; \"Don\u0027t assume that it\u0027s too late to get involved.\"\\n\\n After a while, he had more than fifty of these \"aphorisms,\" which he shared with his friends. One friend, a fellow Brandeis professor named Maurie Stein, was so taken with the words that he sent them to a Boston Globe reporter, who came out and wrote a long feature story on Morrie. The headline read:\\n\\n A PROFESSOR\u0027S FINAL COURSE: HIS OWN DEATH\\n\\n The article caught the eye of a producer from the \"Nightline\" show, who brought it to Koppel in Washington, D. C.\\n\\n \"Take a look at this,\" the producer said.\\n\\n Next thing you knew, there were cameramen in Morrie\u0027s living room and Koppel\u0027s limousine was in front of the house.\\n\\n Several of Morrie\u0027s friends and family members had gathered to meet Koppel, and when the famous man entered the house, they buzzed with excitement-all except Morrie, who wheeled himself forward, raised his eyebrows, and interrupted the clamor with his high, singsong voice.\\n\\n \"Ted, I need to check you out before I agree to do this interview.\"\\n\\n There was an awkward moment of silence, then the two men were ushered into the study. The door was shut. \"Man,\" one friend whispered outside the door, \"I hope Ted goes easy on Morrie.\"\\n\\n \"I hope Morrie goes easy on Ted,\" said the other.\\n\\n Inside the office, Morrie motioned for Koppel to sit down. He crossed his hands in his lap and smiled.\\n\\n \"Tell me something close to your heart,\" Morrie began.\\n\\n \"My heart?\"\\n\\n Koppel studied the old man. \"All right,\" he said cautiously, and he spoke about his children. They were close to his heart, weren\u0027t they?\\n\\n \"Good,\" Morrie said. \"Now tell me something, about your faith.\"\\n\\n Koppel was uncomfortable. \"I usually don\u0027t talk about such things with people I\u0027ve only known a few minutes.\"\\n\\n \"Ted, I\u0027m dying,\" Morrie said, peering over his glasses. \"I don\u0027t have a lot of time here.\"\\n\\n Koppel laughed. All right. Faith. He quoted a passage from Marcus Aurelius, something he felt strongly about. Morrie nodded.\\n\\n \"Now let me ask you something,\" Koppel said. \"Have you ever seen my program?\"\\n\\n Morrie shrugged. \"Twice, I think.\" \"Twice? That\u0027s all?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t feel bad. I\u0027ve only seen `Oprah\u0027 once.\" \"Well, the two times you saw my show, what did you think?\"\\n\\n Morrie paused. \"To be honest?\"\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n \"I thought you were a narcissist.\" Koppel burst into laughter.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m too ugly to be a narcissist,\" he said.\\n\\n Because Morrie sat in the wheelchair, the camera never caught his withered legs. And because he was still able to move his hands-Morrie always spoke with both hands waving-he showed great passion when explaining how you face the end of life.\\n\\n \"Ted,\" he said, \"when all this started, I asked myself, `Am I going to withdraw from the world, like most people do, or am I going to live?\u0027 I decided I\u0027m going to live-or at least try to live-the way I want, with dignity, with courage, with humor, with composure.\\n\\n \"There are some mornings when I cry and cry and mourn for myself. Some mornings, I\u0027m so angry and bitter. But it doesn\u0027t last too long. Then I get up and say, `I want to live . . .\u0027\\n\\n \"So far, I\u0027ve been able to do it. Will I be able to continue? I don\u0027t know. But I\u0027m betting on myself that I will.\"\\n\\n Koppel seemed extremely taken with Morrie. He asked about the humility that death induced.\\n\\n \"Well, Fred,\" Morrie said accidentally, then he quickly corrected himself. \"I mean Ted . . . \"\\n\\n \"Now that\u0027s inducing humility,\" Koppel said, laughing.\\n\\n The two men spoke about the afterlife. They spoke about Morrie\u0027s increasing dependency on other people. He already needed help eating and sitting and moving from place to place. What, Koppel asked, did Morrie dread the most about his slow, insidious decay?\\n\\n Morrie paused. He asked if he could say this certain thing on television.\\n\\n Koppel said go ahead.\\n\\n Morrie looked straight into the eyes of the most famous interviewer in America. \"Well, Ted, one day soon, someone\u0027s gonna have to wipe my ass.\"\\n\\n \"Who is Morrie Schwartz,\" he said, \"and why, by the end of the night, are so many of you going to care about him?\"\\n\\n A thousand miles away, in my house on the hill, I was casually flipping channels. I heard these words from the TV set \"Who is Morrie Schwartz?\"-and went numb.\\n\\n \"Mitchell?\" Morrie says, reading from the attendance list. I raise a hand.\\n\\n \"Do you prefer Mitch? Or is Mitchell better?\"\\n\\n I have never been asked this by a teacher. I do a double take at this guy in his yellow turtleneck and green corduroy pants, the silver hair that falls on his forehead. He is smiling.\\n\\n Mitch, I say. Mitch is what my friends called me.\\n\\n \"Well, Mitch it is then,\" Morrie says, as if closing a deal. \"And, Mitch?\"\\n\\n Yes?\\n\\n \"I hope that one day you will think of me as your friend.\"\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/260/2456.html","bookId":229,"book":{"id":229,"title":"相约星期二 Tuesdays with Morrie","description":"简介： Tuesdays with Morrie is a 1997 non-fiction novel by American writer Mitch Albom.
