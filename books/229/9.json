{"id":7058,"no":9,"title":"The First Tuesday We Talk About the World","content":"Connie opened the door and let me in. Morrie was in his wheelchair by the kitchen table, wearing a loose cotton shirt and even looser black sweatpants. They were loose because his legs had atrophied beyond normal clothing size-you could get two hands around his thighs and have your fingers touch. Had he been able to stand, he\u0027d have been no more than five feet tall, and he\u0027d probably have fit into a sixth grader\u0027s jeans.\\n\\n \"I got you something,\" I announced, holding up a brown paper bag. I had stopped on my way from the airport at a nearby supermarket and purchased some turkey, potato salad, macaroni salad, and bagels. I knew there was plenty of food at the house, but I wanted to contribute something. I was so powerless to help Morrie otherwise. And I remembered his fondness for eating.\\n\\n \"Ah, so much food!\" he sang. \"Well. Now you have to eat it with me.\"\\n\\n We sat at the kitchen table, surrounded by wicker chairs. This time, without the need to make up sixteen years of information, we slid quickly into the familiar waters of our old college dialogue, Morrie asking questions, listening to my replies, stopping like a chef to sprinkle in something I\u0027d forgotten or hadn\u0027t realized. He asked about the newspaper strike, and true to form, he couldn\u0027t understand why both sides didn\u0027t simply communicate with each other and solve their problems. I told him not everyone was as smart as he was.\\n\\n Occasionally, he had to stop to use the bathroom, a process that took some time. Connie would wheel him to the toilet, then lift him from the chair and support him as he urinated into the beaker. Each time he came back, he looked tired.\\n\\n \"Do you remember when I told Ted Koppel that pretty soon someone was gonna have to wipe my ass?\" he said.\\n\\n I laughed. You don\u0027t forget a moment like that. \"Well, I think that day is coming. That one bothers me.\"\\n\\n Why?\\n\\n \"Because it\u0027s the ultimate sign of dependency. Someone wiping your bottom. But I\u0027m working on it. I\u0027m trying to enjoy the process.\"\\n\\n Enjoy it?\\n\\n \"Yes. After all, I get to be a baby one more time.\" That\u0027s a unique way of looking at it.\\n\\n \"Well, I have to look at life uniquely now. Let\u0027s face it. I can\u0027t go shopping, I can\u0027t take care of the bank accounts, I can\u0027t take out the garbage. But I can sit here with my dwindling days and look at what I think is important in life. I have both the time-and the reason-to do that.\"\\n\\n So, I said, in a reflexively cynical response, I guess the key to finding the meaning of life is to stop taking out the garbage?\\n\\n He laughed, and I was relieved that he did.\\n\\n You bother keeping up with the news, I asked? \"Yes,\" Morrie said. \"Do you think that\u0027s strange? Do you think because I\u0027m dying, I shouldn\u0027t care what happens in this world?\"\\n\\n Maybe.\\n\\n He sighed. \"Maybe you\u0027re right. Maybe I shouldn\u0027t care. After all, I won\u0027t be around to see how it all turns out.\\n\\n \"But it\u0027s hard to explain, Mitch. Now that I\u0027m suffering, I feel closer to people who suffer than I ever did before. The other night, on TV, I saw people in Bosnia running across the street, getting fired upon, killed, innocent victims . . . and I just started to cry. I feel their anguish as if it were my own. I don\u0027t know any of these people. But-how can I put this?-I\u0027m almost . . . drawn to them.\"\\n\\n His eyes got moist, and I tried to change the subject, but he dabbed his face and waved me off.\\n\\n \"I cry all the time now,\" he said. \"Never mind.\"\\n\\n Amazing, I thought. I worked in the news business. I covered stories where people died. I interviewed grieving family members. I even attended the funerals. I never cried. Morrie, for the suffering of people half a world away, was weeping. Is this what comes at the end, I wondered? Maybe death is the great equalizer, the one big thing that can finally make strangers shed a tear for one another.\\n\\n Morrie honked loudly into the tissue. \"This is okay with you, isn\u0027t it? Men crying?\"\\n\\n Sure, I said, too quickly.\\n\\n He grinned. \"Ah, Mitch, I\u0027m gonna loosen you up. One day, I\u0027m gonna show you it\u0027s okay to cry.\"\\n\\n Yeah, yeah, I said. \"Yeah, yeah,\" he said.\\n\\n We laughed because he used to say the same thing nearly twenty years earlier. Mostly on Tuesdays. In fact, Tuesday had always been our day together. Most of my courses with Morrie were on Tuesdays, he had office hours on Tuesdays, and when I wrote my senior thesiswhich was pretty much Morrie\u0027s suggestion, right from the start-it was on Tuesdays that we sat together, by his desk, or in the cafeteria, or on the steps of Pearlman Hall, going over the work.\\n\\n So it seemed only fitting that we were back together on a Tuesday, here in the house with the Japanese maple out front. As I readied to go, I mentioned this to Morrie.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re Tuesday people,\" he said. Tuesday people, I repeated.\\n\\n Morrie smiled.\\n\\n \"Mitch, you asked about caring for people I don\u0027t even know. But can I tell you the thing I\u0027m learning most with this disease?\"\\n\\n What\u0027s that?\\n\\n \"The most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love, and to let it come in.\"\\n\\n His voice dropped to a whisper. \"Let it come in. We think we don\u0027t deserve love, we think if we let it in we\u0027ll become too soft. But a wise man named Levine said it right. He said, `Love is the only rational act.\u0027 \"\\n\\n He repeated it carefully, pausing for effect. \" `Love is the only rational act.\u0027 \"\\n\\n I nodded, like a good student, and he exhaled weakly. I leaned over to give him a hug. And then, although it is not really like me, I kissed him on the cheek. I felt his weakened hands on my arms, the thin stubble of his whiskers brushing my face.\\n\\n \"So you\u0027ll come back next Tuesday?\" he whispered.\\n\\n Some of us are agitated. When is lie going to say something? We squirm, check our watches. A few students look out the window, trying to be above it all. This goes on a good fifteen minutes, before Morrie finally breaks in with a whisper.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s happening here?\" he asks.\\n\\n And slowly a discussion begins as Morrie has wanted all along-about the effect of silence on human relations. My are we embarrassed by silence? What comfort do we find in all the noise?\\n\\n I am not bothered by the silence. For all the noise I make with my friends, I am still not comfortable talking about my feelings in front of others-especially not classmates. I could sit in the quiet for hours if that is what the class demanded.\\n\\n On my way out, Morrie stops me. \"You didn\u0027t say much today,\" he remarks.\\n\\n I don\u0027t know. I just didn\u0027t have anything to add.\\n\\n \"I think you have a lot to add. In fact, Mitch, you remind me of someone I knew who also liked to keep things to himself when he was younger.\"\\n\\n Who?\\n\\n \"Me.\"\\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/260/2460.html","bookId":229,"book":{"id":229,"title":"相约星期二 Tuesdays with Morrie","description":"简介： Tuesdays with Morrie is a 1997 non-fiction novel by American writer Mitch Albom.
