{"id":7059,"no":10,"title":"The Second Tuesday We Talk About Feeling Sorry for Yourself","content":"I came back the next Tuesday. And for many Tuesdays that followed. I looked forward to these visits more than one would think, considering I was flying seven hundred miles to sit alongside a dying man. But I seemed to slip into a time warp when I visited Morrie, and I liked myself better when I was there. I no longer rented a cellular phone for the rides from the airport. Let them wait, I told myself, mimicking Morrie.\n The newspaper situation in Detroit had not improved. In fact, it had grown increasingly insane, with nasty confrontations between picketers and replacement workers, people arrested, beaten, lying in the street in front of delivery trucks.\n In light of this, my visits with Morrie felt like a cleansing rinse of human kindness. We talked about life and we talked about love. We talked about one of Morrie\u0027s favorite subjects, compassion, and why our society had such a shortage of it. Before my third visit, I stopped at a market called Bread and Circus-I had seen their bags in Morrie\u0027s house and figured he must like the food there-and I loaded up with plastic containers from their fresh food take-away, things like vermicelli with vegetables and carrot soup and baklava.\n When I entered Morrie\u0027s study, I lifted the bags as if I\u0027d just robbed a bank.\n \"Food man!\" I bellowed.\n Morrie rolled his eyes and smiled.\n Meanwhile, I looked for signs of the disease\u0027s progression. His fingers worked well enough to write with a pencil, or hold up his glasses, but he could not lift his arms much higher than his chest. He was spending less and less time in the kitchen or living room and more in his study, where he had a large reclining chair set up with pillows, blankets, and specially cut pieces of foam rubber that held his feet and gave support to his withered legs. He kept a bell near his side, and when his head needed adjusting or he had to \"go on the commode,\" as he referred to it, he would shake the bell and Connie, Tony, Bertha, or Amy-his small army of home care workerswould come in. It wasn\u0027t always easy for him to lift the bell, and he got frustrated when he couldn\u0027t make it work.\n I asked Morrie if he felt sorry for himself.\n \"Sometimes, in the mornings,\" he said. \"That\u0027s when I mourn. I feel around my body, I move my fingers and my hands-whatever I can still move-and I mourn what I\u0027ve lost. I mourn the slow, insidious way in which I\u0027m dying. But then I stop mourning.\"\n Just like that?\n \"I give myself a good cry if I need it. But then I concentrate on all the good things still in my life. On the people who are coming to see me. On the stories I\u0027m going to hear. On you-if it\u0027s Tuesday. Because we\u0027re Tuesday people.\"\n I grinned. Tuesday people.\n \"Mitch, I don\u0027t allow myself any more self-pity than that. A little each morning, a few tears, and that\u0027s all.\"\n I thought about all the people I knew who spent many of their waking hours feeling sorry for themselves. How useful it would be to put a daily limit on self-pity. just a few tearful minutes, then on with the day. And if Morrie could do it, with such a horrible disease . . .\n \"It\u0027s only horrible if you see it that way,\" Morrie said. \"It\u0027s horrible to watch my body slowly wilt away to nothing. But it\u0027s also wonderful because of all the time I get to say good-bye.\"\n He smiled. \"Not everyone is so lucky.\"\n I studied him in his chair, unable to stand, to wash, to pull on his pants. Lucky? Did he really say lucky?\n I put the paper away. Morrie was rolled back insmiling, as always-and Connie went to lift him from the wheelchair to the recliner.\n You want me to do that? I asked.\n There was a momentary silence, and I\u0027m not even sure why I offered, but Morrie looked at Connie and said, \"Can you show him how to do it?\"\n \"Sure,\" Connie said.\n Following her instructions, I leaned over, locked my forearms under Morrie\u0027s armpits, and hooked him toward me, as if lifting a large log from underneath. Then I straightened up, hoisting him as I rose. Normally, when you lift someone, you expect their arms to tighten around your grip, but Morrie could not do this. He was mostly dead weight, and I felt his head bounce softly on my shoulder and his body sag against me like a big damp loaf.\n \"Ahhhn,\" he softly groaned.\n I gotcha, I gotcha, I said.\n Holding him like that moved me in a way I cannot describe, except to say I felt the seeds of death inside his shriveling frame, and as I laid him in his chair, adjusting his head on the pillows, I had the coldest realization that our time was running out.\n And I had to do something.\n On this day, Morrie says he has an exercise for us to try. We are to stand, facing away from our classmates, and fall backward, relying on another student to catch us. Most of us are uncomfortable with this, and we cannot let go for more than a few inches before stopping ourselves. We laugh in embarrassment. Finally, one student, a thin, quiet, dark-haired girl whom I notice almost always wears bulky white fisherman sweaters, crosses her arms over her chest, closes her eyes, leans back, and does not flinch, like one of those Lipton tea commercials where the model splashes into the pool.\n For a moment, I am sure she is going to thump on the floor. At the last instant, her assigned partner grabs her head and shoulders and yanks her up harshly.\n \"Whoa!\" several students yell. Some clap. Morrie _finally smiles.\n \"You see,\" he says to the girl, \"you closed your eyes. That was the difference. Sometimes you cannot believe what you see, you have to believe what you feel. And if you are ever going to have other people trust you, you must feel that you can trust them, too-even when you\u0027re in the dark. Even when you\u0027re falling. \"\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/260/2461.html","bookId":229,"book":{"id":229,"title":"相约星期二 Tuesdays with Morrie","description":"简介： Tuesdays with Morrie is a 1997 non-fiction novel by American writer Mitch Albom.
