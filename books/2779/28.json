But it\u0027s cold out there.\"\\n\\n \"Come on,\" he says as he pulls her toward the door.\\n\\n We all follow Gavin outside and stand next to Eddie. I look at Nick but he shrugs, implying he doesn\u0027t know what\u0027s going on, either. Gavin pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket and stands in front of Eddie.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t write this letter, Sweetie. But I was told to read it.\"\\n\\n Eddie looks at us and smiles, trying to gain hints from our expressions. We can\u0027t give her any, because we don\u0027t even know.\\n\\n It was July 4th when you came to me. Independence Day. You were fourteen. You burst in the door and went straight to the refrigerator, telling me you needed a sprite. I didn\u0027t have any sprite. You told me it was okay and you grabbed a Dr. Pepper instead. You freaked me out. I told the caseworker there was no way I could keep you. I\u0027d never fostered a teenager before. She told me she would find you somewhere to go the next day, that she just needed me to keep you for the night.\\n\\n I was so nervous. I didn\u0027t know what to say to a fourteen year old girl. I didn\u0027t know what kinds of things they liked, what shows they watched. I was clueless. But you made it so easy. You were so worried about making me feel comfortable.\\n\\n Later that night when it was dark outside-we heard fireworks. You grabbed my hand and pulled me off the couch and drug me outside. We laid on the grass in the front yard and we watched the sky. You didn\u0027t shut up. You told me all about the family you just came from, the family before that, and the family before that. The whole time you were talking, I was listening. Listening to this little girl, so full of life. So full and enthralled with a life that tried so hard to knock her down.\\n\\n Eddie gasps when she sees Joel in the window of the restaurant with dozens of pink balloons. He walks outside and stands beside Gavin. Gavin continues reading the letter.\\n\\n I\u0027ve never been able to give you much. Other than eventually teaching you how to park, I\u0027ve never even taught you very much. But you\u0027ve taught me more than you will ever know. And on this very special birthday, your eighteenth birthday-you no longer belong to the state of Michigan. And as of right now, you legally no longer belong to me. You no longer belong to any of the following people that once held claim to you and your past.\\n\\n Joel starts reading names out loud as he releases balloons one by one. Eddie is crying as we all watch the balloons slowly disappear into the darkness. He continues releasing them, until all 29 siblings and all 13 parents names have been read and released.\\n\\n He still has one pink balloon remaining in his hand. Across the front of it, in big black letters, it says DAD.\\n\\n Gavin folds the paper up and takes a step back as Joel walks toward Eddie.\\n\\n \"I hope for your birthday, you’ll accept this gift,\" Joel says as he hands her the pink balloon. \"I want to be your Dad, Eddie. I want to be your family for the rest of your life.\"\\n\\n Eddie hugs him and they cry. The rest of us slowly walk back inside Getty’s so they can have their moment.\\n\\n \"Oh my god, I need a napkin,\" I sniff as I search for something to wipe my eyes. I grab some napkins off the counter when I look at Nick and Gavin. They\u0027re both crying. I grab a few more napkins for them as we walk back to our booth.\\n\\n 17.\\n\\n “If I get murdered in the city\\n\\n don’t go revengin’ in my name\\n\\n One person dead from such is plenty\\n\\n No need to go get locked away.”\\n\\n -The Avett Brothers, Murder in the City\\n\\n Chapter Seventeen\\n\\n I can honestly say I feel like I\u0027ve moved through the five stages of grief in every aspect of my life.\\n\\n I have accepted my father\u0027s death. I accepted his death months before we even moved to Michigan. I\u0027ve accepted my mother\u0027s fate. I realize she hasn\u0027t even died yet, and that the stages of grief will once again recommence when she does. But I know it won\u0027t be as hard.\\n\\n I\u0027ve accepted living in Michigan. The song I listened to on repeat at Will\u0027s house in the floor was called Weight of Lies. A portion of the lyrics say,\\n\\n \"The weight of lies will bring you down, follow you to every town \u0027cause\\n\\n nothing happens here that doesn\u0027t happen there.\"\\n\\n Every time the song looped, all I ever heard was the part about the lies-and how they weigh you down. Tonight as I drive toward Detroit in my jeep, I know what those words really mean. It\u0027s not just lies they\u0027re referring to. It\u0027s life. You can\u0027t run to another town, another place, another state. Whatever it is you’re running from-it goes with you. It stays with you until you find out how to confront it.\\n\\n Whatever it is I was hoping to run back to Texas from, it would eventually make its way back to me. So here I am in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Where I\u0027ll stay. And I\u0027m okay with that.\\n\\n I\u0027ve accepted the situation with Will. I don\u0027t blame him at all for what he chose. Sure, I had fantasies of him sweeping me off my feet, telling me he doesn\u0027t need a career when he has love. The reality of it is, if he would have put his feelings for me first; it would\u0027ve been hard to accept that he could so easily throw away the things that are the most important to him. It would have said a lot less about his character. So, I don\u0027t blame him, I respect him. And someday when I\u0027m ready, I\u0027ll thank him.\\n\\n I pull up to the club a little after eight o\u0027clock. Gavin had a surprise for Eddie so they took a detour, said they\u0027d be here late. The parking lot is unusually crowded, so I have to take a spot in the back of the building. When I get out of the car, I take a deep breath and prepare myself. I\u0027m not sure when it was that I decided I was going to perform tonight, but I\u0027m having second thoughts.\\n\\n My mother\u0027s words linger in my head as I make my way to the front door. \"Push your boundaries Lake, that’s what they’re there for.\"\\n\\n I can do this. They\u0027re just words. Repeat them and you\u0027re done. It\u0027s that simple.\\n\\n I walk in the door a few minutes late. I can tell the sac is about to perform because you could hear a pin drop. I sneak in and quietly make my way to the back of the room. I don\u0027t want to draw attention to myself, so I slide into an empty booth. I take my phone out to turn the volume down and text Eddie letting her know where I\u0027m sitting. That\u0027s when it happens; I hear him.\\n\\n Will is standing in front of the microphone on the stage, performing a piece as the sacrifice.\\n\\n I used to love the ocean.\\n\\n Everything about her.\\n\\n Her coral reefs, her white caps, her roaring waves, the rocks they lap, her pirate legends and mermaid tails,\\n\\n Treasures lost and treasures held…\\n\\n And ALL\\n\\n Of her fish\\n\\n In the sea.\\n\\n Yes, I used to love the ocean,\\n\\n Everything about her.\\n\\n The way she would sing me to sleep as I lay in my bed\\n\\n then wake me with a force\\n\\n That I soon came to dread.\\n\\n Her fables, her lies, her misleading eyes,\\n\\n I\u0027d drain her dry\\n\\n If I cared enough to.\\n\\n I used to love the ocean,\\n\\n Everything about her.\\n\\n Her coral reefs, her white caps, her roaring waves, the rocks they lap, her pirate legends and mermaid tails, treasures lost and treasures held.\\n\\n And ALL\\n\\n Of her fish\\n\\n In the sea.\\n\\n Well, if you\u0027ve ever tried navigating your sailboat through her stormy seas, you would realize that her white caps are your enemies. If you\u0027ve ever tried swimming ashore when your leg gets a cramp and you just had a huge meal of In-n-Out burgers that\u0027s weighing you down, and her roaring waves are knocking the wind out of you, filling your lungs with water as you flail your arms, trying to get someone\u0027s attention, but your friends\\n\\n just\\n\\n wave\\n\\n back at you?\\n\\n And if you\u0027ve ever grown up with dreams in your head about life, and how one of these days you would pirate your own ship and have your own crew and that all of the mermaids\\n\\n would love\\n\\n Well, you would realize…\\n\\n Like I eventually realized…\\n\\n That all the good things about her?\\n\\n All the beautiful?\\n\\n It\u0027s not real.\\n\\n It\u0027s fake.\\n\\n So you keep your ocean,\\n\\n I\u0027ll take the Lake.\\n\\n Air. Or Water. I don\u0027t know which one I need. I slide out of the booth and head toward the front door but make a beeline for the bathroom. I just need silence.\\n\\n When I open the door to the bathroom, the stalls are empty. There\u0027s a girl washing her hands at the only available sink, so I decide to wait on the water. I pick the big stall. I lock it behind me and lean up against the door.\\n\\n Did that just really happen? Does he know I\u0027m even here? No, he doesn\u0027t. I told him I wasn\u0027t coming. He didn\u0027t intend for me to hear it. Even so, he wrote it. He said himself that he writes what he\u0027s feeling. Oh my god, he loves me. Will Cooper is in love with me.\\n\\n I\u0027ve known all along how he felt about me. I can see it in the way he looks at me. But to hear his words and the emotions behind them-how he said my name. How am I supposed to face him? I\u0027m not. He still doesn\u0027t know I\u0027m here, I just have to leave. I need to leave before he sees me.\\n\\n I open the bathroom door and scan the area but I don\u0027t see him. Luckily, another performer is on stage so most of the eyes are glued to the front of the room. I slip through the entryway and out the front door.\\n\\n \"Layken! Look what Gavin got me!\" Eddie is making her way inside, holding her hair back, wanting me to look at her ears.\\n\\n \"Eddie, I\u0027ve got to go.\"\\n\\n Her smile fades.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll call you later.\" I brush past her without looking at the earrings. \"You didn\u0027t see me!\" I yell behind me as I go.\\n\\n I make my way around the building and smash into Javier as he\u0027s rounding the corner. Good grief! Is the whole class here? Someone\u0027s going to let it slip that I was here. I don\u0027t want Will to know I saw him.\\n\\n \"Hey, what\u0027s the hurry?\" he asks as I slip between him and the wall.\\n\\n \"I gotta go. I\u0027ll see you tomorrow.\" I quickly walk away. I don\u0027t have time for chit chat. I just want to get in my jeep and pull out of this parking lot as soon as I can.\\n\\n \"Wait, I\u0027ll walk you to your car,\" he says as he catches up to me.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fine, Javi. Go ahead and go inside, they already started.\"\\n\\n \"Layken, we\u0027re in Detroit. You\u0027re parked behind a club. I\u0027m walking you to your car.\"\\n\\n \"Fine. But walk fast.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s your hurry?\" he asks as we make our way to the rear of the building.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m just tired. I need sleep,\" I say as I slow down, feeling confident that Will didn\u0027t see me.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a café down the road. Want to go grab some coffee?\" he asks.\\n\\n \"No, thanks. I don\u0027t need caffeine, I need my bed.\"\\n\\n He is silent as we make our way to my jeep in the back of the lot. I reach down to grab my keys out of my-shit! My purse. I left my purse in the booth.\\n\\n \"Shit!\" I say as I kick at the gravel in front of me. My shoe loosens a piece of rock and it flicks against the door of my jeep.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" he asks.\\n\\n \"My purse. I left my keys and my purse inside.\" I fold my arms across my chest and lean against the jeep.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not that big of a deal. We\u0027ll go back inside and get them.\"\\n\\n \"No, I don\u0027t want to. Would you mind getting it for me?\" I smile at him, hoping it will be enough.\\n\\n \"Layken, you don\u0027t need to stay back here by yourself.\"\\n\\n \"Fine. I\u0027ll just text Eddie to bring it out. Do you have your phone?\"\\n\\n He pats his pockets. \"No, it\u0027s in my truck. Come on, you can use it.\" Javi says this as he reaches down and takes my hand and leads me toward his truck. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/slammed-slammed-1/page-28.html","bookId":2779,"book":{"id":2779,"title":"Slammed (Slammed #1)","description":"Storyline: Slammed (Slammed #1) \\n Following the unexpected death of her father, 18-year-old Layken is forced to be the rock for both her mother and younger brother.
