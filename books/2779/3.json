You can keep the cup.\"\\n\\n I look at the cup before taking another sip and notice the big letters emblazoned on the side. World\u0027s Greatest Dad. It\u0027s the exact same cup my father used to drink coffee from.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be okay,\" I say as I head toward the front door. \"I think I\u0027ve got the whole walking erect thing down now.\"\\n\\n He follows me outside and shuts his front door behind him, insisting I take his jacket with me. I pull it on over my shoulders, thank him again, then head across the street.\\n\\n “Layken!” he yells just as I\u0027m about to walk back inside my house. I turn back toward him and he\u0027s standing in his driveway.\\n\\n “May the force be with you!\" He laughs and hops into his car and backs out of the driveway as I stand there, staring down at the Darth Vader house shoes I\u0027m still sporting. Classic.\\n\\n The coffee helps. I locate the thermostat and by lunch the house has finally started to warm up. Mom and Kel are gone to the utility company to get everything switched into her name and I’m left with the last of the boxes, if you don\u0027t count what’s still in the jeep. I get a few more things unpacked and decide it\u0027s high time for a shower. I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027m closing in on day three of my granola girl look.\\n\\n I get out of the shower and wrap myself in a towel; flipping my hair forward as I brush it out and blow dry it. When it\u0027s dry, I point the blow dryer at the fogged up mirror, forming a clear circular area so that I can apply a little makeup. I notice my tan has started to fade. There won\u0027t be much laying out here so I might as well get used to a slightly paler complexion.\\n\\n I brush my hair and pull it back into a ponytail and put on some lip-gloss and mascara. I forego the blush since there no longer seems to be a need for it anymore. Between the weather and my brief encounters with Will my cheeks seem to stay red.\\n\\n I search my closet and find a long sleeved shirt and throw it on with some jeans and the socks I wasn\u0027t able to find this morning. The only shoes I find that are weather appropriate are a pair of thin black boots. I slide them on and zip them up over my pant legs.\\n\\n Mom and Kel have already come and gone while I was in the shower. There is a note from her informing me she and Kel are following her friend Brenda into the city to return the U-Haul. Three twenty-dollar bills are on the counter next to the car keys and a grocery list. I snatch them up and head to the jeep, reaching it successfully this time.\\n\\n I realize as I\u0027m putting the car into reverse that I have absolutely no idea where I\u0027m going. I know nothing about this town, much less whether I need to turn left or right off of my own street. Will\u0027s little brother is in their front yard so I pull the car up parallel to their curb and roll down my passenger window.\\n\\n “Hey, come here for a sec!” I yell at him.\\n\\n He looks at me and hesitates. Maybe he thinks I\u0027m going to bust out in Zombie mode again. He walks toward the car, but stops three feet short of the window.\\n\\n \"How do I get to the closest grocery store?\" I ask him.\\n\\n He rolls his eyes. “Seriously? I\u0027m nine.\"\\n\\n Okay. So the resemblance to his brother is only skin deep.\\n\\n \"Well, thanks for nothing,\" I say. \"What\u0027s your name anyway?\"\\n\\n He smiles at me mischievously and yells, “Darth Vader!” He’s laughing as he runs in the opposite direction of the car.\\n\\n Darth Vader? I realize the significance of his response. He\u0027s making a crack at the house shoes I had on this morning. Not a big deal. The big deal is that Will must have been talking about me to him. I can\u0027t help but try to imagine the conversation between them, and what Will thinks about me. If he even thinks about me. For some reason, I\u0027ve been thinking about him more than I\u0027m comfortable with. I keep wondering how old he is, what his major is, if he\u0027s single.\\n\\n Luckily, I didn\u0027t leave any boyfriends behind in Texas. I haven\u0027t dated anyone in almost a year. Between High School, my part time job, and helping out with Kel\u0027s sports, I hadn\u0027t had much time for boys. I realize it\u0027s going to be an adjustment, going from a person with absolutely no free time to a person with absolutely nothing to do.\\n\\n I reach into the glove box to retrieve my GPS.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not a good idea,\" Will says.\\n\\n I look up to see him walking toward the car. I make my best attempt to stifle the smile that is involuntarily trying to take over my face. \"What\u0027s not a good idea?\" I ask as I insert the GPS into its holder and power it on.\\n\\n He crosses his arms as he leans in the window of the car.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s quite a bit of construction going on right now. That thing will get you lost.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m about to respond when Brenda pulls up along side me with my mother. Brenda rolls down her driver window and my mother leans across the seat.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t forget laundry detergent, I can\u0027t remember if I put it on the list. And cough syrup. I think I\u0027m coming down with something,\" she says through the window.\\n\\n Kel jumps out of the backseat, runs to Will\u0027s brother and invites him inside to look at our house.\\n\\n \"Can I?\" Will\u0027s brother asks him.\\n\\n \"Sure,\" Will says as he opens my passenger door. \"I\u0027ll be back in a little while, Caulder. I\u0027m riding with Layken to the store.\"\\n\\n He is? I shoot a look in his direction as he\u0027s buckling his seat belt.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t give very good verbal directions. Mind if I go with you?\"\\n\\n \"I guess not,\" I laugh.\\n\\n I look back toward Brenda and my mother but they have already pulled forward into the driveway. I put the car in drive and listen as Will gives me directions out of the neighborhood.\\n\\n \"So, Caulder is your little brother\u0027s name?\" I ask, making a half-hearted attempt at small talk.\\n\\n \"One and only. My parents tried for years to have another baby after me. They eventually had Caulder when names like \u0027Will\u0027 weren\u0027t that cool anymore.\"\\n\\n \"I like your name,\" I say. I immediately regret saying it as soon as it comes out of my mouth. It sounds like a lame attempt at flirting.\\n\\n He laughs. I like his laugh. I hate that I like his laugh.\\n\\n It startles me when I feel him brush the hair off my shoulder and touch my neck. His fingers slip under the collar of my shirt and he pulls it slightly down over my shoulder. “You\u0027re going to need a new bandage soon.\" He pulls my shirt back up and gives it a pat. His fingers leave a streak of heat across my neck.\\n\\n \"Remind me to grab some at the store,\" I say, trying to prove that his actions and his presence have no effect on me whatsoever.\\n\\n \"So, Layken.\" He pauses as he glances past me at the boxes still piled high in the back seat. \"Tell me about yourself.\"\\n\\n \"Um, no. That\u0027s so cliché,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Fine,\" he laughs. \"I\u0027ll figure you out myself.\" He leans forward and hits eject on my c.d. player. His movements are so fluid, like he’s been rehearsing them for years. I envy this about him. I’ve never been known for my grace.\\n\\n \"You know, you can tell a lot about a person by their taste in music.\" He pulls the c.d. out and examines the label.\\n\\n \"Layken\u0027s shit?\" he laughs aloud. \"Is \u0027shit\u0027 descriptive here, or possessive?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like Kel touching my shit, okay?\" I grab the c.d. out of his hands and insert it back into the player.\\n\\n When the banjo pours out of the speakers at full volume, I\u0027m immediately embarrassed. I\u0027m from Texas, but I don\u0027t want him confusing this for country music. If there\u0027s one thing I don\u0027t miss about Texas, it\u0027s the country music. I reach over and turn down the volume when he grabs my hand in objection.\\n\\n \"Turn it back up, I know this,\" he says as his hand remains clasped on top of mine.\\n\\n My fingers are still on the volume so I turn it back up. There\u0027s no way he knows this. I realize he\u0027s bluffing; his own lame attempt at flirting.\\n\\n \"Oh yeah?\" I say. I\u0027ll call his bluff. \"What\u0027s it called?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s The Avett Brothers,\" he says. \"I call it \u0027Gabriella,’ but I think it\u0027s the end to one of their \u0027Pretty Girl\u0027 songs. I love the end of this one when they break out with the electric guitars.\"\\n\\n His response to my question startles me. He really does know this. \"You like The Avett Brothers?\"\\n\\n \"I love them. They played in Detroit last year. Best live show I\u0027ve ever seen,\" he says.\\n\\n A rush of adrenaline shoots through my body as I look down at his hand, still holding onto mine, still holding onto the volume button. I like it, but I\u0027m mad at myself for liking it. Boys have given me the butterflies before, but I usually have more control over my susceptibility to such mundane movements.\\n\\n He notices me noticing our hands and he lets go, rubbing his palms on his pant leg. It seems like a nervous gesture, and I\u0027m curious if he shares my uneasiness.\\n\\n I tend to listen to music that isn’t typically mainstream. It’s rare when I meet someone that has even heard of half the bands I love. The Avett Brothers are my all time favorite, though.\\n\\n My father and I would stay up at night and sing some of the songs together as he attempted to work the chords out on his guitar. He described them to me once. He said, \"Lake, you know a band has true talent when their imperfections define perfection.\"\\n\\n I eventually understood what he meant when I started really listening to them. Broken banjo strings, momentary passionate lapses of harmony, voices that go from smooth to gravelling to all out screaming in a single verse. All these things add substance, character and believability to their music.\\n\\n After my father died, my mother gave me an early present he had intended to give me for my eighteenth birthday—a pair of Avett Brothers concert tickets. I cried when she gave them to me, thinking about how much my father was probably looking forward to giving me the gift himself. I knew he would have wanted me to use them, but I couldn’t. The concert was just weeks after his death and I knew I wouldn’t be able to enjoy it. Not like I would have if he were with me.\\n\\n \"I love them too,” I say unsteadily.\\n\\n \"Have you ever seen them play live?\" Will asks.\\n\\n I’m not sure why, but as we talk, I tell him the entire story about my dad. He listens intently, interrupting only to instruct me when and where to turn. I tell him all about our passion for music. I tell him about how my father died suddenly and extremely unexpectedly of a heart attack. I tell him about my eighteenth birthday and the concert we never made it to. I don\u0027t know why I keep talking, but I can\u0027t seem to shut myself up. I never divulge information so freely, especially to people I barely know. Especially to guys I barely know. I\u0027m still talking when I realize we’ve come to a stop in a grocery store parking lot.\\n\\n \"Wow,\" I say as I take in the time on the clock. \"Is that the quickest way to the store? That drive took twenty minutes.”\\n\\n He winks at me as he opens his door. \"No, actually it\u0027s not.\"\\n\\n That\u0027s definitely flirting. And I definitely have butterflies.\\n\\n The snow flurries start to mix with sleet as we\u0027re making our way through the parking lot. “Run,” he says. He takes my hand in his and pulls me faster toward the entrance.\\n\\n We’re out of breath and laughing when we make it inside the store, shaking the wetness from our clothes. I take my jacket off and shake it out when his hand brushes against my face, wiping a strand of wet hair away that\u0027s stuck to my cheek. His hand is cold but the moment his fingers graze my skin, I forget about the frigid temperatures when my face grows warm. His smile fades as we both stare at each other. I’m still trying to become accustomed to the reactions I have around him. The slightest touch and simplest gestures have such an illicit effect on my senses. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/slammed-slammed-1/page-3.html","bookId":2779,"book":{"id":2779,"title":"Slammed (Slammed #1)","description":"Storyline: Slammed (Slammed #1) \\n Following the unexpected death of her father, 18-year-old Layken is forced to be the rock for both her mother and younger brother.
