You have to give us the choice. We haven\u0027t had a choice in any of this. You have to give us this one.\"\n \"Okay,\" she says.\n \"Okay? Okay you\u0027ll think about it? Or okay, okay?\"\n \"Okay, okay.\"\n I hug her. I hug her tighter than I\u0027ve ever hugged her before.\n \"Lake?\" she says. \"You\u0027re getting basagna sauce all over me.\"\n I pull away and realize I\u0027m still holding the spatula and it\u0027s dripping all over her back.\n \"Why can\u0027t he come over?\" Kel asks after I pull in the driveway and send Caulder home.\n \"I told you already. Mom needs to talk to us.\"\n We walk inside the house and Mom is putting the basagna in the oven.\n \"Mom, guess what?\" Kel says as he runs to the kitchen.\n \"What, Sweetie?\"\n \"Our school is having a costume contest on Halloween. The winner gets fifty bucks!\"\n \"Fifty bucks? Wow. Have you decided what you want to be yet?\"\n \"Not yet.\" He walks over to the bar and throws his backpack down.\n \"Did your sister tell you we\u0027re all having a talk tonight?\"\n \"Yeah. She didn\u0027t have to, though. We\u0027re having basagna.\"\n My mother and I both look at him.\n \"Every time we have basagna it\u0027s bad news. Y\u0027all cooked basagna when grandpa died. Y\u0027all cooked basagna when y\u0027all told me dad was dead. Y\u0027all cooked basagna when y\u0027all told me we were moving to Michigan. Y\u0027all are cooking basagna right now. Someone\u0027s either dying or we\u0027re moving back to Texas.\"\n My mom looks at me wide eyed, questioning our timing. He seems to have opened it up for an even earlier discussion. She walks over to him and sits down. I follow suit.\n \"You\u0027re very observant, that\u0027s for sure,\" she says.\n \"So, which one is it?\" he asks, looking up at her.\n She places her hand on the side of his face and strokes it. \"I have lung cancer, Kel.\"\n He immediately throws his arms around her and hugs her. She strokes the back of his head, but he doesn\u0027t cry. They are both silent for a while as she waits for him to speak.\n \"Are you gonna die?\" he finally asks. His voice is muffled because his head is buried in her shirt.\n \"I am, Sweetie. But I don\u0027t know when. Until then though, we\u0027re going to spend a lot of time together. I quit my job today so that I can spend more time with you.\"\n I wasn\u0027t sure how he would react. At only nine years old, he probably won\u0027t grasp the true reality of it until after she actually passes away. My father\u0027s death was sudden and unexpected, which naturally prompted a more dramatic reaction from him.\n \"But what about after you die? Who are we gonna go live with?\"\n \"Your sister is an adult now. You\u0027re going to live with her.\"\n \"But I wanna stay here, by Caulder,\" he says as he lifts his head from her shirt and looks at me. \"Layken, are you gonna make me move back to Texas with you?\"\n Up until this very second, I had every intention of moving back to Texas.\n \"No, Kel. We\u0027re staying right here.\"\n Kel sighs, soaking in everything he\u0027s just been told. \"Are you scared, Mom?\" he asks her.\n \"Not anymore,\" she says. \"I\u0027ve had a lot of time to accept it. In fact, I feel lucky. Unlike your dad, at least I\u0027ve got warning. Now I get to spend more time with the two of you here at home.\"\n He lets go of my mother and puts his elbows on the bar.\n \"You have to promise me something, Layken.\"\n \"Okay,\" I respond.\n \"Don\u0027t ever make basagna again.\"\n We all laugh. We all laugh. This was the hardest thing my mother and I have ever had to do, and we\u0027re laughing. Kel is amazing.\n Two hours later, we have a huge spread of basagna, bread sticks and salad. There\u0027s no way we\u0027re eating all of this.\n \"Kel, why don\u0027t you go see if Caulder and Will have eaten yet,\" my mother says as she eyes the food with me. Kel darts out the door.\n She sets two more places at the table while I fill drinks with tea.\n \"We need to talk to Will about helping out with Kel,\" I tell her.\n \"Will? Why?\"\n \"Because, I want to take you to your treatments from now on. It\u0027s too much for Brenda. I can miss a day of school every now and then, or we can go when I get out.\"\n \"Okay,\" she says as we finish preparing the table.\n Kel and Caulder come running through the front door, followed by Will a moment later.\n \"Kel said we\u0027re having basagna?\" Will asks hesitantly.\n \"Yes sir,\" my mother says as she scoops basagna onto plates.\n \"What is basagna? Bologne lasagna?\"\n He looks scared.\n \"It\u0027s basagna. And it\u0027s the last time we\u0027ll ever have it so you better enjoy it,\" she says.\n Will walks to the table and waits for Mom and I to sit before he takes his seat.\n We pass around breadsticks and salad until everyone\u0027s plates are filled. And just like last night, Kel is the first one to make it awkward.\n \"My mom\u0027s dying, Caulder.\"\n Will glances at me and I give him a half smile, letting him know we talked.\n \"When she dies, I\u0027m gonna live with Layken. Just like you live with Will. It\u0027s like we\u0027ll be the same. All of our parents will be dead, and we\u0027ll live with our brother and sister.\"\n \"Cool. That\u0027s crazy,\" Caulder says.\n \"Caulder!\" Will yells.\n \"It\u0027s fine, Will,\" my mom says. \"It is kind of crazy if you think about it from the perspective of a nine-year-old.\"\n \"Mom,\" Kel says. \"What about your bedroom? Can I have it? It\u0027s bigger than mine.\"\n \"No,\" I say. \"It\u0027s got a bathroom in it. I get her bedroom.\"\n Kel looks defeated. I don\u0027t budge, though. I\u0027m getting the bedroom with the bathroom.\n \"Kel, you can have my computer,\" my mother says.\n \"Sweet!\"\n I look at Will, hoping this conversation isn\u0027t weirding him out, but he\u0027s laughing. This is exactly what he was hoping would happen. Acceptance.\n Over dinner, we all discuss what will happen over the next few months and make arrangements for Caulder and Kel while mom receives her treatments. Will agreed to let Kel come over whenever he needed to and said he\u0027ll continue to take them to school. I\u0027ll be picking them up on the way home every day, unless I\u0027m at a treatment with mom. She made Will agree to let her cook them supper most nights in return for his help. The entire night was a success. I feel like together, we all just punched death square in the face.\n \"I\u0027m exhausted,\" my mom says. \"I need to take a shower and get to bed.\"\n She walks into the kitchen where Will is washing dishes at the sink. She puts her arms around his waist and hugs him from behind. \"Thanks, Will. For everything.\"\n He turns around and hugs her back.\n When she walks past me on her way to her bedroom, she purposefully nudges me with her shoulder. She doesn\u0027t speak a word but I know what she\u0027s hinting at-she\u0027s giving me her approval. Again. Too bad it doesn\u0027t count.\n I wipe the table off and walk to the sink to rinse out the rag.\n \"Eddie\u0027s birthday is Thursday. I don\u0027t know what I should get her.\"\n \"Well, I know what you shouldn\u0027t get her,\" he says.\n \"Believe me, I know,\" I laugh. \"I think Gavin\u0027s taking her out Thursday night. Maybe I\u0027ll do something for her on Friday.\"\n \"Oh, speaking of Friday. Do you guys need me to watch Kel Friday? I forgot Caulder and I go to Detroit this weekend.\"\n \"No, you\u0027re fine. Family stuff?\"\n \"Yeah. We stay with our grandparents one weekend a month. Kind of a truce we worked out for me stealing him away in the middle of the night.\"\n \"That\u0027s fair enough,” I say. I reach over to the sink and unplug the drain.\n \"So you won\u0027t be at the slam Thursday?\" he asks.\n \"No. We\u0027ll watch Caulder that night, though. Just send him over after school.\"\n He puts the last dish in the strainer and dries his hands on the towel.\n \"It\u0027s pretty weird isn\u0027t it? How everything worked out? You guys moving here when you did? Kel and Caulder finding each other, right when Kel probably needed a best friend the most? Him taking your mother\u0027s news so well? It just all worked out.\"\n He turns toward me and smiles. \"I\u0027m proud of you, Lake. You did good today.\" He plants one of his lingering kisses on my forehead, then walks to the living room.\n \"Caulder still needs to take a shower, I guess we need to go. I\u0027ll see you tomorrow,\" he says.\n \"Yeah. See ya.\"\n I sigh as I think about the one thing that isn\u0027t on his mind. The one incredibly huge thing that didn\u0027t work out; us.\n I\u0027m starting to accept it. That we won\u0027t be together. That we can\u0027t be together. Especially the last two nights he\u0027s been here. It really feels like we\u0027ve finally transitioned. There are definitely still moments, but none we\u0027re not able to overcome. It\u0027s only October and he\u0027ll be my teacher until June. That\u0027s still eight long months. When I look at the shift my life has made in the past eight months, I can\u0027t fathom what my life will be eight months from now. When I lie down and close my eyes, I make a resolution. Will is not going to be my first priority anymore. I\u0027m putting my mother first, Kel second and life third.\n Finally. He no longer has a hold on me.\n \"Eddie, will you go grab me a chocolate milk, Babe? I forgot to get one.\" Gavin is giving Eddie puppy dog eyes. Eddie rolls her eyes and gets up. As soon as she leaves the table, he turns toward us and starts whispering.\n \"Tomorrow night. Getty’s. Six o\u0027clock. Bring a pink balloon. And we\u0027re going to the slam afterward.\"\n \"Gavin, are you crazy? That\u0027s not funny, she\u0027ll be pissed,\" I whisper.\n \"Just trust me.\"\n She\u0027s back at the table with the chocolate milk.\n \"Here, Babe. You owe me fifty-cents.\"\n \"I owe you my heart,\" Gavin says as she hands him the milk.\n She slaps him lightly across the head. \"Oh, grow a pair! You\u0027re such a sap,\" she says, right before she kisses his cheek.\n I reluctantly walk into Getty’s pizza with a pink balloon in my hand. Gavin and Nick are gathered in the back of the room at a booth. He motions for me to join them. There are so many pink balloons. She\u0027s going to be pissed.\n Gavin grabs my balloon and writes something on it with a big marker. \"Here,\" Gavin says as he hands me the fistful of balloons. \"Take all these and go to the back by the bathrooms. I\u0027ll come get you when it\u0027s time, she\u0027ll be here soon.\"\n He shoves me toward the bathroom before I have a chance to object. I stand in a corner in the hallway between the men\u0027s room and the janitors’ closet. I look up at all the balloons, and that\u0027s when I notice there are names written on each one of them.\n Moments later, an older gentleman walks down the hall toward me.\n \"Are you Layken?\" he asks.\n \"Yes,\" I reply.\n \"I\u0027m Joel, Eddie’s foster dad.\"\n \"Oh, hey.\"\n \"Gavin wants you out front, I\u0027ll take the balloons now. Eddie\u0027s out there. She thinks I went to the bathroom so don\u0027t say anything about the balloons.\"\n \"Uh, okay.\" I hand him the balloons and walk back to the table.\n \"Layken! You came! Guys this is so sweet,\" Eddie says. She starts to sit at the booth when Gavin pulls her back up. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/slammed-slammed-1/page-27.html","bookId":2779,"book":{"id":2779,"title":"Slammed (Slammed #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Slammed (Slammed #1) \n Following the unexpected death of her father, 18-year-old Layken is forced to be the rock for both her mother and younger brother.
