{"id":70260,"no":40,"title":"Page 40","content":"David felt nothing at the man\u0027s words. No fear. No anger. Only the frigid calm of knowing he was going to feel this man die. He was going to take his life with his bare hands and make sure—without any doubt—that he could never hurt another woman again.\\n\\n David tossed his gun to the ground with a metallic clatter and spread his hands wide. \"Here I am. Let the woman go, and I\u0027m yours.\"\\n\\n David could feel Caleb tense behind him. They\u0027d been buddies too long for David not to know that Caleb was thinking he was being a complete idiot giving himself up like that.\\n\\n A malicious grin lit the man\u0027s eyes. \"Tell your gargantuan friend there to back off,\" ordered the blond man.\\n\\n \"Get out, Caleb. I can handle this.\"\\n\\n Caleb took a step and David could now see him out of the corner of his eye. \"Don\u0027t be an idiot, Wolfe. He\u0027s gonna—\"\\n\\n David didn\u0027t let Caleb finish. \"I said get out! That\u0027s an order, Lieutenant.\"\\n\\n \"Not without the girl, Captain,\" said Caleb.\\n\\n David forced out a frustrated sigh though he still felt nothing but the incessant prowling of the monster inside him and the pressing need to kill.\\n\\n \"Fine.\" He walked right over to Noelle, making himself an easy target. The scarred man\u0027s gun moved from Noelle to David, giving him the chance to get her away. He shoved her wheeled chair toward Caleb, trusting him to get her out safely. As long as she got out, David truly didn\u0027t care what happened to him.\\n\\n Now that David was within easy reach, the scarred man grabbed him around the throat with one arm and pressed the cold muzzle of his weapon against the side of David\u0027s face.\\n\\n David forced himself to feel nothing.\\n\\n Caleb grabbed Noelle, chair and all, and picked her up as if she was no heavier than a sack of groceries.\\n\\n The chair dripped red, which David could now see was more water than blood. Noelle had been hurt, but not as badly as he\u0027d suspected. He wanted to feel relief, but couldn\u0027t. If he let go even that much, the torrent of emotions pounding for release would burn him alive.\\n\\n Once Noelle was safely on her way out of the building, David deliberately let his monster free. It howled in delight and took over David\u0027s body, giving him nearly inhuman speed.\\n\\n With one flash of David\u0027s elbow, the scarred man\u0027s weapon went flying across the room. It was only a matter of seconds before David had the man pinned on the concrete floor, with his hands around the man\u0027s throat, watching him die.\\n\\n David felt nothing. No sense of victory, no joy. Nothing.\\n\\n When David could no longer feel the beat of the scarred man\u0027s heart beneath his fingers, he let go. Just to be sure the man would not come back from the dead again, David retrieved his weapon and put two bullets through the man\u0027s head.\\n\\n Only then did he turn to walk away.\\n\\n Caleb hadn\u0027t left as he\u0027d been ordered. He was standing guard over Noelle, using his body to shield hers, and his weapon was aimed at the dead man. He\u0027d stayed in case David had needed backup.\\n\\n Noelle\u0027s head hung limply from her shoulders, but she was still conscious enough to see him. Her green eyes were bright with fear and revulsion, staring at the man David had just killed. She\u0027d seen the whole thing. She\u0027d seen him kill with his bare hands.\\n\\n Noelle hated violence, and after what she\u0027d just witnessed, David was sure that she would have no choice but to hate him as well.\\n\\n Fury rose up in him, but he stomped it down. He had to keep hold of his emotions for her sake. He had to get her out of here safely.\\n\\n David crossed the room, watching Noelle as he moved. She was getting weaker by the second. He could Uee her strength draining from her with every shiver of her slim body. David refused to let himself feel anything. Not yet. Not until Noelle was safe and warm. He\u0027d done it. He\u0027d avenged Mary\u0027s death, but it brought him no joy. No satisfaction.\\n\\n He reached out for her and she flinched away from his touch.\\n\\n It was confirmation of everything David had feared. She\u0027d seen him kill with his bare hands to save her and in doing so, he\u0027d lost her forever.\\n\\n CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT\\n\\n Noelle felt warmth close around her body. She couldn\u0027t open her eyes, but she heard familiar voices in little snips of conversation. She could smell David\u0027s skin as he warmed her, using his own body.\\n\\n \"... she\u0027s freezing ... get her warm... frostbite ...\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s dead.\" That voice was David\u0027s, though it didn\u0027t sound right. It sounded flat and cold.\\n\\n \"... injuries aren\u0027t severe ... worried about hypothermia ...\"\\n\\n Noelle struggled for enough strength to speak. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she whispered. \"I tried not to teli them the coordinates. I tried ...\"\\n\\n \"Hush, now,\" said David. He was close to her, speaking right next to her ear. His voice was still odd, but she didn\u0027t care. It was David. He was safe. \"You didn\u0027t do anything wrong.\"\\n\\n The warmth started to burn as feeling returned to her toes. Noelle stopped fighting sleep.\\n\\n She woke later in a bed. There were hands all around her, a plastic mask over her nose and mouth. Everything hurt and she could feel needles poking her skin all over.\\n\\n \"Give her something for the pain,\" demanded David.\\n\\n He was close, but she couldn\u0027t get her eyes open to see him. She tried to talk but couldn\u0027t figure out how to move the mask.\\n\\n She felt the IV in the back of her hand wiggle, then whatever they\u0027d given her for pain started working, and she went back to sleep.\\n\\n The next time she woke it was dark. She was thirsty and her throat burned. There were faint noises around her of men talking in hushed whispers. \"David?\" she croaked.\\n\\n The whispers stopped and she felt a warm, callused hand grasp hers. He was here. She was safe.\\n\\n David refused to leave Noelle\u0027s side for two days. He was tired and hungry and ached from head to toe, but he couldn\u0027t bring himself to leave her. Not even knowing that as soon as she woke up, she\u0027d look at him with revulsion.\\n\\n Caleb stepped into the hospital room, his large body filling the doorway. There were no windows to the outside, for security reasons, and the only light in the room came in through tiny slits in the miniblinds covering the window in the interior wall that overlooked the nurses\u0027 station.\\n\\n Caleb approached on silent feet, his black eyes taking in Noelle\u0027s condition in one thorough, sweeping glance.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s better today,\" he stated as he stepped up to the bed, across from David.\\n\\n \"Yeah. I think she is. It\u0027s hard to tell under all those bruises, but I keep hoping.\"\\n\\n \"You should get a shower. I\u0027ll sit with her while you\u0027re gone, if you like.\"\\n\\n One side of David\u0027s mouth twitched. \"Is that your subtle way of telling me I stink?\"\\n\\n \"A lot. If you want her to have anything to do with you when she wakes up, I suggest you clean the mud off your boots, shower and put on fresh clothes.\"\\n\\n David looked back at Noelle. She was so still and pale under all the bruises that every time he saw her his gut twisted into a tight knot. He\u0027d nearly lost her, and the thought still shook him to the core every time it passed through his mind, which was about every thirty seconds. He tried not to think about it, but the room was quiet, and her cuts and bruises were constant reminders of how close he\u0027d come to losing her. How close she\u0027d come to ending up like Mary.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll leave in a while.\"\\n\\n Caleb nodded in acceptance and pulled up a chair to sit down. He settled into his seat with the patience of a man who had no plans of going anywhere soon. \"What are you going to do now?\" asked Caleb.\\n\\n \"What do you mean? I\u0027m going to sit here until she wakes up.\"\\n\\n \"And then what?\"\\n\\n David looked up into Caleb\u0027s patient, black gaze. A bleak emptiness filled his chest. He knew what Caleb was asking.\\n\\n David knew what he had to do. As much as it hurt him, he had to walk away from Noelle. Her doctor had confirmed that she wasn\u0027t pregnant. He\u0027d demanded that they check, just in case. She\u0027d started her period, so there wasn\u0027t even that excuse left to keep David from leaving. David had to give her a chance for a real life—one without the threat of violence looming over her every day\\n\\n She deserved to be happy. He wanted her to be happy. He loved her enough to walk away so that she could be.\\n\\n David planned to go into hiding so deep that no one would ever find him again. Not even Monroe. He\u0027d leave the country, crawl into some jungle so thick it would swallow him whole. Not even satelhtes would be able to see him.\\n\\n He\u0027d disappear and Noelle would be safe from the taint of violence that still stained his soul.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not what she wants,\" said Caleb, as if hearing David\u0027s silent thoughts. \"That\u0027s not what you want.\"\\n\\n \"And you know me so well after being apart for two years that you think you know what I really want?\"\\n\\n Caleb nodded his dark head. \"Yeah. I do.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, Mr. Observant. What do you think I really want?\"\\n\\n \"Noelle.\"\\n\\n \"Well, of course I still want her. She\u0027s a beautiful woman.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not talking about sex. I\u0027m talking about more than that. Commitment. Love. Forever.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t. Not again. Not after what happened to Mary.\"\\n\\n \"Noelle isn\u0027t Mary. If you can\u0027t figure that out, then you don\u0027t deserve her.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t deserve Mary, either.\"\\n\\n \"She thought you did. She\u0027d want you to be happy, you know.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. I do. She loved me, but part of me feels like I\u0027m\u0027 cheating on her, betraying her memory somehow.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re only betraying her memory if you stop living. You\u0027ve been dead for two years. Isn\u0027t that long enough to punish yourself?\"\\n\\n The only punishment that fit his crime was to die the same way Mary had—tortured, cold and alone.\\n\\n David pulled the gold chain off his neck and dangled his wedding band in front of him. Light played over the simple golden surface, making his eyes sting with tears. He still loved Mary. He always would. How could he dishonor her by putting another innocent woman in harm\u0027s way because he was selfish enough to want a second chance at happiness?\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t. He loved Noelle as much as he\u0027d loved Mary. He never thought it would be possible to love like that again, but he did. It only made it that much harder to walk away from her.\\n\\n It also made it that much more necessary.\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t matter what I want,\" said David.\\n\\n \"Fine. Let\u0027s just say you\u0027re right about that. What about what Noelle wants?\" asked Caleb.\\n\\n \"Noelle hates violence. She saw what 1 did to that man who\u0027d taken her, and I saw the way she looked at me when I reached for her. She pulled away. Flinched as if I\u0027d hurt her.\"\\n\\n Caleb stared at him with a look that told David he thought he was a total idiot. \"Hell, I\u0027d have pulled away, too.\\n\\n You have no idea what you looked like back there, do you?\"\\n\\n At David\u0027s bewildered frown, Caleb said, \"You were covered in mud, your face streaked with paint. There were spots of blood on your clothes and skin and a feral gleam in your eyes that had even me scared you\u0027d gone over the edge. You\u0027d just killed a man with your bare hands and you looked like you were ready to do it again. She probably figured you\u0027d gone a little crazy. Hell, I thought the same thing until you calmed down.\"\\n\\n \"She should have known I\u0027d never hurt her. The fact that she didn\u0027t only proves that she really does see me as a violent man.\"\\n\\n Caleb rolled his black eyes and gave a snort of disgust. \"She was out of her head, man—delirious from drugs and hypothermia and likely scared to death she was going to die. And she\u0027s a civilian. Give her a break, fuckhead. Unless you\u0027re just using that as an excuse not to try to make things work with her.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/no-regrets-delta-force-1/page-40.html","bookId":2374,"book":{"id":2374,"title":"No Regrets (Delta Force #1)","description":"Storyline: No Regrets (Delta Force #1) \\n Renowned cryptologist Noelle Blanche refuses to have blood on her hands.
