So when the military asks for her help in a covert operation, she refuses--until masked gunmen raid her home and threaten her life.

A stranger who is everything she detests, everything she fears...and everything she desires. \n Former Delta Force operative David Wolfe thought he had left it all behind--the horror, the hurt, the guilt. But now the men who savagely murdered his wife have set their sights on a brilliant cryptologist who can lead them to the cache of weapons they prize. As passion ignites between David and the woman he\u0027s sworn to protect, what began as just a mission escalates into the fight of his life. But can he prevent history from repeating itself?\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/no-regrets-delta-force-1.jpg","author":"Shannon K.
