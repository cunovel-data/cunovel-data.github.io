{"id":70221,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"CHAPTER ONE\\n\\n David Wolfe\u0027s past caught up with him in the parking lot of a small-town grocery store in the Rocky Mountains. Late-November sun warmed his dark hair but did nothing to rid him of the chill of foreboding that sank into him with every step he took toward his former commanding officer.\\n\\n Colonel George Monroe lounged against David\u0027s Jeep, blocking his escape.\\n\\n \"What are you doing here, sir?\" asked David, his tone sharp with displeasure.\\n\\n Colonel Monroe regarded David with a steady stare that would have made a less confident man go pale. Monroe\u0027s once-black hair was shot steely gray with age, and he had the emotionless eyes of a man who\u0027d seen too much suffering in one lifetime. But in his white knit shirt and khakis, he looked more like a retired golfer than he did a commander of the world\u0027s most elite, secret fighting force.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a hard man to find, Wolfe,\" said Monroe.\\n\\n \"I wasn\u0027t wanting to be found, sir,\" replied David. \"I\u0027m surprised that you got this far.\"\\n\\n \"We traced the money you sent your sister for her son\u0027s surgery.\"\\n\\n David spat a searing curse. He\u0027d wired the funds from over a hundred miles away under an alias of an alias of a man who didn\u0027t even exist. Monroe should never have been able to find him.\\n\\n Unless he\u0027d really been working at it.\\n\\n Ripples of unease slipped down David\u0027s spine. Whatever Monroe wanted from him, it couldn\u0027t be good. Powerful military leaders like Monroe didn\u0027t ambush former military men in grocery store parking lots just to catch up on old times.\\n\\n \"What do you want?\" demanded David.\\n\\n \"We need you, Wolfe. There\u0027s a ... situation.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t give a damn about your situation,\" said David, purposefully adding a belated, \"Sir.\"\\n\\n Monroe\u0027s mouth twitched with a hint of a smile. \"I see you haven\u0027t lost your respect for authority these past two years.\"\\n\\n \"No, but I\u0027m about to lose my temper, so you\u0027d best move away from my Jeep and find yourself another man for your situation. I quit Delta Force two year\u0027s ago, remember?\"\\n\\n Monroe didn\u0027t budge and David was quickly beginning to think that he was going to have to show Monroe just how much he\u0027d learned in all those years of being under his command—training to fight with whatever was at hand, and when nothing was at hand, fighting with nothing. His body tensed as he sized up Monroe for a quick, efficient takedown.\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t do that if I were you, Wolfe,\" said Monroe as if reading David\u0027s violent thoughts. \"I\u0027m not stupid enough to think I could take you on in a fair fight, so I brought backup. There\u0027s a sniper a hundred yards behind you in the trees. He\u0027s not as good as Grant, but he\u0027s good enough.\" A brief, feral smile flashed over Monroe\u0027s face.\\n\\n David froze, suddenly feeling the weight of a lethal rifle aimed at his skull. If he touched Monroe, it would be the last thing he did.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a bastard, sir,\" said David.\\n\\n \"So says my wife, but then she doesn\u0027t know me like you do.\" Monroe flicked a hand signal at the sniper and David recognized the command to wait—on alert. \"I need you to take on an assignment and I\u0027m not taking no for an answer.\"\\n\\n \"Yes you will. I don\u0027t owe you anything. I walked away with a clean slate. The only favors I owe are to Grant and Caleb, and they\u0027re not the ones asking.\" David suppressed his guilt as he mentioned his two closest friends—the men he owed his life to countless times over. The men he\u0027d walked away from two years ago, leaving them to carry on the tight for freedom without him.\\n\\n Monroe tilted his head and looked directly into David\u0027s eyes. He was one of the few men David knew who could really look at him and not flinch. \"You\u0027re wrong. You do owe me.\"\\n\\n The sudden softness in Monroe\u0027s voice worried David. Men like Monroe were never soft—not with their wives or children and certainly not with the men like David, who they ordered to the most hellish places on earth to kill some of the most vile people ever to draw breath.\\n\\n \"What the hell are you talking about?\" asked David.\\n\\n \"I was the one who ordered the rest of Delta to stand down on your last op.\"\\n\\n Pain seared David\u0027s chest at the mention of that failed operation and just how much it had cost him. His body shook and the groceries crunched under his tightening grip. Against his will, his eyes shut and he was forced to face the horror of his two-year-old memories, still painfully fresh in his mind.\\n\\n \"You were the one who gave that order?\" The lack of air in his lungs made the question come out as a thready whisper.\\n\\n \"I did,\" said Monroe. \"And I\u0027d do it again today if faced with the same choice.\"\\n\\n Had David not had the small outlet of revenge Monroe had given him, he wouldn\u0027t have lasted this long. The guilt would have eaten him whole.\\n\\n \"Were you court-martialed?\" asked David.\\n\\n Monroe looked away, his gray eyes sliding uncomfortably to the woods behind David, where the sniper waited for a sign to kill. \"It doesn\u0027t matter now. What does matter is that I need your help. I never meant to call in that particular favor, but I don\u0027t have any choice. I need you to come back for this op. Lives are at stake.\"\\n\\n Bleak, painful memories flooded David\u0027s ffead and he fought to hold them back—to stem the flow of blood, death and pain all cloaked in shades of nightmares.\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t go back,\" growled David, unfamiliar with the raw sound of his own voice. \"I can\u0027t. I lost too much working for you to ever go back.\"\\n\\n Monroe\u0027s mouth flattened into a grim line. \"The Swarm has resurfaced. They\u0027ve started killing again.\"\\n\\n David was so shocked it rocked him back onto his heels. \"That\u0027s impossible. I killed them all. I torched the building and watched to make sure not one of them made it out alive.\"\\n\\n David relived every single moment of his last op in the space of a heartbeat. He felt the blind rage that had gripped him as he killed, felt the grim satisfaction of knowing that the Swarm would never hurt anyone again, felt the hollow emptiness of knowing that no matter how many men he killed, he couldn\u0027t bring back the dead. Revenge changed nothing.\\n\\n After several tense moments, David was able to rebuild the barrier on the part of his mind that was a tempest of chaotic nightmares—images that beat at his sanity until only a bubble-thin film remained.\\n\\n \"Four civilians are dead and the life of a young woman is at stake. I need you. She needs you.\"\\n\\n \"You want me to protect her?\" asked David in disbelief. \"You must be desperate.\"\\n\\n Monroe pulled in a deep, weary breath. \"You know the Swarm. You know their tactics. You also know what will happen to her if you fail.\"\\n\\n Seething, violent rage billowed up into David\u0027s throat, leaving behind the acid taste of bile. For two years he\u0027d thought that he\u0027d taken out every one of the Swarm\u0027s members. Before he quit Delta Force he\u0027d made sure that they could never harm an innocent again.\\n\\n He\u0027d been wrong. For two years, he\u0027d been wrong.\\n\\n \"Tell me where the Swarm is now,\" demanded David in a near growl. \"I\u0027ll kill every last one of them myself.\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t know where they are. But we know what they want.\"\\n\\n \"The woman,\" guessed David.\\n\\n Monroe nodded. \"Dr. Noelle Blanche. Stick with her and you won\u0027t have to find the Swarm. They\u0027ll find you.\"\\n\\n A slow, ferocious smile curled over David\u0027s lips. \"Where is she?\"\\n\\n \"We need to talk.\"\\n\\n Noelle Blanche started, and she turned around to see who had interrupted her concentration.\\n\\n Professor Joan Montgomery, Noelle\u0027s longtime mentor and friend, stood in the doorway of Noelle\u0027s cramped office, looking worried and slightly nauseated.\\n\\n Joan had been one of Noelle\u0027s undergraduate professors at the University of Kansas. She had given Noelle her first taste of Latin and, because of Joan, Noelle\u0027s educational destiny had changed. Her career path to mathematician had taken an exit toward linguistics and she\u0027d ended up at some wacky rest stop called Assistant Professor of Applied Mathematical Linguistics.\\n\\n Noelle forced a welcoming smile on her face, pushing aside the intriguing, vaguely Cyrillic script she\u0027d just received in an e-mail from a colleague in Russia. \"I\u0027m teaching linear algebra in fifteen minutes, but I have until then.\"\\n\\n Joan\u0027s expression twisted with discomfort. \"I\u0027ve been sent by the dean to find out your final decision about that grant. He\u0027s tired of waiting.\"\\n\\n Noelle stifled a resigned sigh. \"I already told him I won\u0027t accept any grants funded by the military.\"\\n\\n Joan tucked her graying, chin-length hair behind one ear, pulled out the orange, 1970s cast-off office chair and sat down. \"Why not? You\u0027re the only one in the department who can do the work. Hell, as far as I know, you\u0027re the only one in the country who can do it.\"\\n\\n Noelle shook her head and shoved a hand through her red curls to untangle them from the hinge of her glasses.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not true. There are at least four other people who know more than I do about that particular flavor of cryptology and two of them live right here in the States. It\u0027s just a hobby for me. They do it full-time.\"\\n\\n \"They weren\u0027t the ones the government offered oodles of grant money,\" Joan reminded her. \"Apparently, you\u0027re a lot more valuable than you think.\"\\n\\n Noelle made a rude, snorting noise. \"My sister\u0027s the smart one. Let them ask her. Or anyone else. Just not me.\"\\n\\n \"Why won\u0027t you do the work? It sounded fairly tame to me. It\u0027s not like they\u0027re asking you to build a bomb or something.\"\\n\\n \"They want me to develop a mathematically based encryption system for military use.\"\\n\\n \"So?\" asked Joan, frowning at Noelle in confusion. \"Don\u0027t you think you can do it?\"\\n\\n Noelle waved a pale hand, almost knocking over the Leaning Tower of Paperwork. \"Of course I can do it. I\u0027m already halfway finished with the algorithms because I couldn\u0027t stop my brain from working on the puzzle while I was sleeping. I\u0027ll have the solution in another two months, whether or not I want to know it, but that\u0027s not the point\"\\n\\n \"Then what is the point? Because I\u0027m not seeing how turning down easy money is going to help solidify your position here at the university.\"\\n\\n \"If I give the military a tool, they will use it. Eventually, they will use it offensively. When that happens, people wili die and I\u0027ll be partially responsible. I can\u0027t do that.\"\\n\\n \"If you don\u0027t, someone else at some other university will,\" said Joan, her face softening with understanding. \"You\u0027re brilliant, and it will probably take someone else five years to do what you can in two months, but eventually, someone will figure it out. Eventually, someone will give the military their tool.\"\\n\\n \"But it won\u0027t be me,\" replied Noelle. \"I won\u0027t have that blood on my hands, even if it means I get fired.\"\\n\\n \"Downsized,\" corrected Joan with a grimace.\\n\\n \"Whatever.\" It all meant that Noelle would be out of a job.\\n\\n Silence filled the room, broken only by the faint buzzing of the cheap fluorescent light overhead.\\n\\n \"Not whatever,\" said Joan. \"Downsized.\"\\n\\n The apologetic tone of Joan\u0027s voice caught Noelle\u0027s attention. \u0027They sent you to fire me, didn\u0027t they?\"\\n\\n Joan\u0027s dark eyes met Noelle\u0027s green ones. \"If you don\u0027t accept this grant money, you\u0027re going to be let go at the end of the spring semester.\"\\n\\n Let go. Noelle felt like her outdated chair had fallen out from under her. She probably shouldn\u0027t have been shocked, but she was. It was one thing to think about the possibility of losing her job; it was entirely different to know it will happen. And when. \"Are you sure?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/no-regrets-delta-force-1/page-1.html","bookId":2374,"book":{"id":2374,"title":"No Regrets (Delta Force #1)","description":"Storyline: No Regrets (Delta Force #1) \\n Renowned cryptologist Noelle Blanche refuses to have blood on her hands.
