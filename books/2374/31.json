Is she it?\"\n David nodded. \"She has to stay alive, no matter what.\"\n \"That goes without saying,\" said Caleb evenly. \"She\u0027s a woman.\"\n \"No, it\u0027s bigger than just the fact that she\u0027s a woman. A few weeks ago, some of our guys took down a group of men they suspected of selling weapons. They weren\u0027t just any group, they were the Swarm.\"\n \"So how does she fit in?\" asked Grant.\n \"She\u0027s smart. Really smart. Monroe tracked me down and pulled me back in to protect her. She\u0027s the only surviving person who has any chance at all of cracking this old code. It contains the location of a cache of stolen warheads.\n Needless to say, the Swarm wants it for themselves, which means they also want her.\"\n \"Oh, God,\" whispered Grant, his golden eyes going wide with fear.\n Caleb\u0027s face darkened with anger, his nostrils flaring.\n David looked from one horrified buddy to the other, trying to figure out what the hell was going on. \"You gonna share why you\u0027re both so freaked out?\"\n Caleb swallowed hard before he spoke. \"We also intercepted a communication talking about how some U.S.\n scientist is selling off plans for the production of unmanned aerial weapons deployment vehicles. The new ones designed to be undetectable by radar, with enough range to reach anywhere within a couple of hundred miles inland.\n We weren\u0027t too worried because there\u0027d been no chatter about bioweapons, which was our biggest concern.\"\n \"But if they get their hands on those nukes...\" concluded David, feeling his stomach sink to his boots.\n \"Then they\u0027ll have everything they need to wipe out any major U.S. coastal city of their choice,\" finished Caleb.\n David\u0027s buddies both looked at him as if hoping he\u0027d tell them they were wrong. He wished to God he could. \"We can\u0027t let that happen.\"\n \"How close is she to breaking the code?\" asked Grant.\n \"I don\u0027t know. Close, I think, but I don\u0027t want her knowing about this. She\u0027s already under too much pressure.\"\n Both men nodded in agreement.\n \"What can we do to help?\" asked Grant.\n David took a deep breath before he was able to speak. Things were quickly becoming more complicated than he liked. \"Did you bring any gear? Perimeter alarms, communications equipment?\"\n \"No. We just barely managed to get here at all. We figured they wouldn\u0027t look for us for a while, considering our op, but missing equipment... that\u0027d be spotted right away.\"\n David spat out a violent curse. \"This place isn\u0027t secure.\"\n \"No, it\u0027s not,\" said Caleb. \"I built it to be private, not necessarily defensible. I can usually take care of myself no matter where I am.\"\n \"I don\u0027t mean to insult your cabin, man. I just don\u0027t! know where else to take her.\"\n \"A safe house?\" suggested Grant. David grunted. \"Not so safe. The last two we were at were attacked. Someone on the inside leaked her location the first time. The second time I did it myself so I could take them out.\"\n The buddies shared a look that promised violence if they found the person responsible for leaking classified information.\n \"So, how do you want to play this, Captain?\" asked Grant, his gold eyes glinting with eagerness.\n David shook his head. \"We stay here until she\u0027s finished cracking the damn code. Once we know what it says, we may know what to do next. Until then, I\u0027m open to suggestions.\"\n Caleb\u0027s black eyes narrowed in thought as he scanned the tree line. \"There are only a couple of ways up this mountain and only one road that comes all the way up here. Grant and I can keep watch there while you stick by her side.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s such a good idea,\" said David. \"I\u0027m not sure she really wants me around.\"\n \"I\u0027ll stay with her,\" volunteered Grant, waggling his blond brows.\n David gave him an order that would have been anatomically impossible to obey.\n Grant just smiled.\n Caleb shook his head like a father over bickering boys. \"I\u0027ll stay with her if you want, and you know I\u0027d never touch another man\u0027s woman, but I think if you ask her, she\u0027ll want you instead.\"\n \"A man can dream,\" said David.\n \"You two go get that coffee,\" said Caleb. \"I\u0027ll go get our gear.\"\n \"Want some help?\" offered Grant.\n \"No. I know you\u0027re dying to talk to David about something, so now\u0027s your chance to gossip like an old lady.\"\n Grant blinked in surprise but said nothing as Caleb logged off with long, powerful strides.\n \"What\u0027s he talking about?\" asked David.\n Grant rubbed the back of his neck as if it ached. \"I thought I was being subtle. All I did was say how nice it would be to find you and get to talk to a man on the outside who understood what it was like to be part of Delta. I didn\u0027t think Caleb would figure out I wanted to talk to you alone.\"\n \"About what?\"\n Grant pressed his lips together in a thin line. \"I\u0027m thinking about getting out. Leaving the military.\"\n David tried not to show his surprise. Grant loved his job—or at least he had for as long as David had known him, which had been since basic training. \"Why?\"\n Grant\u0027s golden eyes closed. \"It\u0027s starting to get to me.\" He swallowed and David could see his friend straining to hold back some unnamed emotion. \"Last month, we took out a camp of hostiles that were involved in gathering some serious firepower. It wasn\u0027t anything new, except these were ... kids. God, some of them couldn\u0027t have even been teenagers yet.\"\n David was glad he had no idea what killing a child felt like. At least that was one sin he\u0027d never committed.\n \"That doesn\u0027t make them any less deadly,\" said David.\n Grant nodded, but didn\u0027t open his eyes. \"I know. We lost a good man that night in the firefight. Like me, Evans hesitated when he saw they were just kids. It cost him his life.\"\n \"And you\u0027re worried the same thing might happen for you.\"\n Grant looked at him then, a frantic, painful gaze that begged for help. \"Or one of the other men. If anything happened to Caleb because of me ...\"\n David tried to shut down his reaction to the thought of either of his friends getting killed, but it was too late. That worry had already taken root and started to grow, piling right on top of his already respectable pile of worries. \"He can take care of himself,\" said David, trying to convince himself that was all there was to it.\n Grant gave a humorless grunt. \"And everyone around him, apparently. But we\u0027re partners. We cover each other\u0027s backs. Now that you\u0027re gone, I hate to leave him.\"\n David felt a stab of guilt once again for leaving his friends behind. He should have been a stronger man—should have been strong enough to put his grief aside and keep fighting. \"What does he say?\"\n Grant\u0027s mouth lifted in a grin. \"He says I need to get married and give him some kids to play with. His brothers aren\u0027t doing their procreative duty fast enough to suit him.\"\n \"Is that what you want?\"\n Grant was quiet for a while, staring out at the surrounding forest. \"Yeah. It\u0027s what I\u0027ve wanted for a long time. We visited Caleb\u0027s brother, Saul, last year. He\u0027s having some trouble with the ranch back home. Saul could use a hand and I have two good ones.\"\n \"So what\u0027s holding you back?\"\n \"Caleb. He\u0027s ... scaring me lately. Something happened a few months ago. An op went bad and he blames himself.\n He\u0027s taking chances he shouldn\u0027t.\" Grant pinned David with a hard stare. \"You know what I mean.\"\n David felt his gut give a sickening twist. Caleb\u0027s guilt was making him take risks he shouldn\u0027t. Making him not care whether or not he lived through an op. When guilt got too big to bear, oblivion looked like a good solution. David knew all too well. \"Yeah, I know.\"\n \"So you see why I can\u0027t just leave. No one else knows Caleb like we do. He needs me to keep him steady so he doesn\u0027t do anything stupid.\"\n \"Does he want out, too?\" Getting out of Delta was what saved David\u0027s life and those of his buddies. He\u0027d gotten careless in a job where that flaw could easily have been fatal.\n Grant shook his head. \"Not a chance.\"\n David sighed. He didn\u0027t like this at all. Grant and Caleb were his closest friends, and even though he hadn\u0027t been able to keep in touch with them for a long time, it was like no time had passed at all. Being with them again was as natural as breathing. He had to figure out some way to keep them both safe.\n \"What about reassignment to something safer? Intel? Training? Would Caleb go for that?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. He might if it comes as less of a suggestion than an order.\"\n \"You want me to talk to Monroe?\" asked David.\n Grant heaved out a weary sigh. \"He\u0027d kill me if he j knew I\u0027d put you up to it. He\u0027d kill you for doing it.\"\n \"He\u0027ll kill himself if we don\u0027t.\"\n \"I\u0027ve been thinking about asking him to come with me to his family\u0027s ranch. You know, an extended leave without actually making a commitment.\"\n \"What good is that going to do?\"\n \"It would give him a taste of life on the outside for a while. He has a great family—four brothers and a baby sister.\n They\u0027re all hardheaded, but they welcome him home with so much love it\u0027s hard to believe he\u0027d be able to leave them again, especially since he\u0027s needed there. Who knows, he might even catch himself a woman and change his mind about going back.\"\n David thought of Noelle. He hadn\u0027t known her for very long, but already, he wondered just how much he\u0027d willingly give up if he thought he had even a slim chance of keeping her. \"It could work.\"\n \"I have to try something, Captain. I can\u0027t let him keep nsking his life like this. He\u0027s saved me a hundred times over.\n The least I can do is try to save him this once.\"\n \"I\u0027ll talk to Monroe about an extended leave, assuming you both aren\u0027t kicked out completely for coming to help me.\" Part of him hoped they were. At least then his friends would be safe. Maybe not happy, but safe.\n Grant gave a sheepish grin. \"Caleb would do damn near anything for you. The fact that there was a woman in I rouble only sweetened the deal.\"\n \"He\u0027s a good man.\"\n \"One of the best,\" agreed Grant. \"Which is why I have to keep his ass out of trouble. I could never stand to face his family if I let him get himself killed.\"\n David knew that facing Caleb\u0027s family would be the least of Grant\u0027s problems if Caleb died. He\u0027d have to learn lo live with the guilt of knowing he couldn\u0027t bring Caleb hack. That was a hell of a lot worse—something David knew from experience. \"God willing, you won\u0027t have to. One way or another, we\u0027ll protect Caleb, even if it means getting him kicked out.\"\n Owen frowned at the arrival of David\u0027s men. He liked a challenge, but the odds were quickly being stacked against him. That simply wouldn\u0027t do.\n He wasn\u0027t foolish enough to risk losing the girl, which meant he was going to have to call for backup, and not some snot-nosed punk like Brian. Real backup—men he\u0027d trained himself—men who knew the price of failure.\n Owen slid silently back out of sight. The big guy they called Caleb kept looking his way, and even though Owen knew he couldn\u0027t be seen, those black eyes of Caleb\u0027s were still disconcerting. He was going to have to do something about that man before things got out of hand. He was far too dangerous to leave alive. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/no-regrets-delta-force-1/page-31.html","bookId":2374,"book":{"id":2374,"title":"No Regrets (Delta Force #1)","description":"Storyline: \n No Regrets (Delta Force #1) \n Renowned cryptologist Noelle Blanche refuses to have blood on her hands.
