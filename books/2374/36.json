{"id":70256,"no":36,"title":"Page 36","content":"Since Mary.\\n\\n Somehow, thinking about Mary didn\u0027t evoke the same instantaneous pain it always used to. He still felt guilty over her death and had a burning desire to see every last one of the Swarm dead, but Noelle had done something to him that helped ease the searing pain he\u0027d become so familiar with. She was helping him heal.\\n\\n If he hadn\u0027t felt it happening, he wouldn\u0027t have thought it possible.\\n\\n Noelle went completely still. \"I did it,\" she said in a near whisper. \"I figured it out.\"\\n\\n David crossed die space in three long strides. He stared at the screen, not understanding a word or symbol he saw.\\n\\n \"Are you sure?\"\\n\\n She looked up at him, excitement shining in her green eyes. David wanted to kiss her so bad he could almost taste her mouth. \"Yes. I\u0027m one hundred percent positive. Only...\"\\n\\n \"Only what?\"\\n\\n She bit her lip as if trying to figure out what to say. \"This isn\u0027t all of the text.\"\\n\\n \"Then how do you know you cracked it?\"\\n\\n \"I could spend the next twelve hours trying to explain, my solution to you, or you could just take my word.\"\\n\\n David had a hard time sitting through an hour-long lecture. \"I\u0027ll take your word for it.\"\\n\\n \"Did Monroe give you anything else? Any numbers or instructions?\"\\n\\n \"No, nothing.\"\\n\\n Noelle sat back and let out a frustrated sigh. \"Then what I\u0027ve got here isn\u0027t going to help much.\"\\n\\n Disappointment and relief warred within him. It wasn\u0027t over yet, which meant she wasn\u0027t leaving him yet. \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s kinda hard to explain without those twelve hours, but I\u0027ll try. Do you have a map?\"\\n\\n \"Of where?\"\\n\\n Noelle shrugged. \"It doesn\u0027t really matter. I just need it to show you what I mean.\"\\n\\n David rummaged through his knapsack and pulled out a map of Colorado. Noelle went into the kitchen, dumped out a box of dried pasta into a bowl and tore the front off the cardboard box. There was a little clear plastic window that displayed the noodles inside the box. On that window, she drew an arrow and labeled it north. Then she drew another arrow pointing down and to the right.\\n\\n Noelle spread the map out on the counter and placed on top of it the cardboard box front with the plastic window and the arrows she\u0027d drawn. \"Okay. The up arrow is north—just a reference—and the second arrow gives us our solution, which are map coordinates. The tip of the arrow is the destination this text was encrypted to hide. It\u0027s our target location for the weapons.\"\\n\\n David frowned. \"But you don\u0027t know the destination unless you know where to put the arrow on the map.\"\\n\\n \"Exactly. I know magnitude—distance in this case— and direction, but not the origin.\"\\n\\n Frustration welled up in David\u0027s chest. \"All this effort and nothing tangible to show for it. Damn, I\u0027m sorry, Noelle.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not a lost cause. There\u0027s got to be another piece of text somewhere, like this one, which gives us the origin. If we know that, we\u0027ll know where this text was telling us to go. Can\u0027t you ask Monroe?\"\\n\\n \"I can try, but I\u0027m pretty sure that he would have sent along anything he thought we could use. Is it possible you missed something? I mean, couldn\u0027t there be another bit of info in all that gobbledygook?\"\\n\\n Noelle chuckled. \"It\u0027s not gobbledygook. It\u0027s a string of equations that share like variables. The solution to that series of simultaneous equations clearly leads to a fairly simple vector analysis. I made some assumptions along the way, and if I feed my algorithm different values for certain variables, then I will get a solution with a new magnitude and direction—a different vector, but it\u0027s all fairly simple now.\"\\n\\n David stared at her. He could feel his IQ slipping as her words slaughtered brain cells left and right. \"I\u0027m sure it is.\"\\n\\n She seemed agitated that she couldn\u0027t share this with him, but there wasn\u0027t much David could do about that. He just wasn\u0027t in her league when it came to this stuff.\\n\\n \"So, what do we do now?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"First, you make a backup copy of all that stuff and show me how to use it. I want to get you away from this mess as quickly as possible. My gut tells me that as soon as we figure out the last piece of the puzzle, I\u0027ll be going wheels up immediately.\"\\n\\n She looked away quickly as if wanting to hide her eyes from him. \"So we\u0027ll be separating soon then?\"\\n\\n David didn\u0027t like the thought of leaving her behind any more than she did, but he knew it was her best chance for survival. At least until all this was over. He couldn\u0027t very well drag her into the remaining Swarm stronghold when he went to hunt them down. He needed to know she was safe. \"Yeah. We will.\"\\n\\n \"Will I see you again?\" Her voice was so small and vulnerable it made him want to pull her in his arms and promise never to leave her side again. Which was about the stupidest thing he could possibly do.\\n\\n \"You will. We have... unfinished business.\" David didn\u0027t promise. He didn\u0027t know if he\u0027d survive this mission or not, but he knew that if he did, he\u0027d hunt her down no matter how deeply they tried to bury her in any of the protection programs. She was his woman and he wasn\u0027t letting her go until one of them decided to call it quits. Besides, he might have a child on the way, and he wasn\u0027t about to walk away from that while he still drew breath.\\n\\n She nodded, but he could see in her expression that she didn\u0027t believe him. David didn\u0027t blame her one bit. He had a hard time believing that he would come out on the other side of this mission alive too. Even though the odds weren\u0027t great, they were better than they had ever been before because Noelle had given him a reason to live, which was more than he\u0027d had in a long, long time.\\n\\n Caleb and Grant were nearly finished patrolling the perimeter David had set up to protect the cabin when Caleb heard a faint noise. He stopped, motioning Grant to do the same.\\n\\n \"You hear that?\" asked Caleb, sniffing the air for the scent of animals—including the human variety.\\n\\n The sound came again, louder this time—a faint moan coming from the woods. It sounded like a man.\\n\\n Grant nodded and pointed to a thick growth of brush growing in the ditch that ran along the south side of the road leading to the cabin.\\n\\n \"Cover me,\" said Caleb as he readied his weapon and headed for the brash.\\n\\n Caleb felt Grant standing guard at his back, knew his buddy would keep watch in case this was some sort of trap.\\n\\n The breeze shifted, and the smell of blood filled the morning air, thick and heavy. Lots of blood.\\n\\n Caleb leaned down and eased some branches aside. Under the dense overhang of twisted stems and dried leaves he saw an arm clothed in hunter\u0027s camouflage and a pale hand caked with dried blood. Cautiously, Caleb pushed away more branches until he could force his body through a tight opening.\\n\\n The man moaned again, a low, pitiful sound. He was lying on his side with a deep gash a few inches above his right knee. Caleb could see bone. The heavy fabric of his pants was sliced open and soaked with blood around the wound.\\n\\n Just above the horrible cut, the man had buckled his belt tight around his thigh, making a tourniquet to stop the bleeding. A bloody axe lay on the ground a few feet away next to a partially chopped chunk of firewood.\\n\\n The poor bastard had damn near chopped his leg off while gathering wood, and from the amount of blood staining the ground, it was a wonder he was still alive.\\n\\n \"Got a man down, here,\" Caleb told Grant.\\n\\n \"How bad?\"\\n\\n \"Pretty damn bad,\" replied Caleb.\\n\\n \"Anyone we know?\"\\n\\n Caleb turned the man over so he could see his face. Shit. This was not good. \"He\u0027s just a kid. Maybe seventeen. We need to get him some help.\"\\n\\n \"The truck is just down the road. Closer than the cabin.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s nothing in the cabin that can save this kid, anyway. He needs blood and lots of it. We\u0027ve got to get him to a hospital.\" As carefully as he could, Caleb lifted the boy into his arms. The boy let out a rough groan that made Caleb\u0027s stomach churn. He didn\u0027t look good.\\n\\n \"Can you carry him?\" asked Grant from the far side of the thick foliage.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m on it,\" said Caleb. The boy didn\u0027t weigh much, but he was all arms and legs, and it seemed to take forever to work his way back out of the heavy brush without jarring his injured leg.\\n\\n This whole thing made Caleb\u0027s stomach turn. He wasn\u0027t a squeamish man, but the sight of a kid cut up like this tore him apart. At least it hadn\u0027t been a girl. Caleb wasn\u0027t sure he could have handled that. Not after what had happened in Armenia.\\n\\n Grant was still keeping careful watch, scanning the area with his rifle ready to go when Caleb cleared all the branches.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s get moving,\" said Grant. \"I\u0027ve got a bad feeling about this.\"\\n\\n Owen watched the two Delta Force operators until they disappeared around a bend in the gravel road. Brian wasn\u0027 t going to survive long enough to get to a hospital—Owen had made sure he\u0027d lost too much blood for that—but he\u0027d served his purpose. He\u0027d been excellent bait.\\n\\n Owen made a mental note to thank Mr. Lark for sending the boy the next time they spoke. With those two commandos blown into tiny bits by the explosives he\u0027d set in the truck, David and Noelle were going to be much easier targets.\\n\\n Noelle knew her time with David was growing short, but she tried not to let it interfere with what she had to do. She showed David how he could input new values for the missing variables and how to interpret the results. She\u0027d even made him practice.\\n\\n While David used a satellite phone to contact Monroe, Noelle burned a backup copy of her work onto a spare disk she had in her laptop tote bag. Just in case it fell into the wrong hands, she put a password protection script on all the files. It might not have been the best security software out there, but it was decent, and it sure would slow down anyone who didn\u0027t know what they were doing.\\n\\n Across the room, she heard him speak in a low voice over the phone. \"No, sir. She\u0027s sure. There\u0027s got to be another script we didn\u0027t recover.\"\\n\\n Noelle could hear Monroe\u0027s deep voice cursing on the other end of the line, even from across the cabin.\\n\\n \"Yes, sir. That\u0027s what I thought, too.\"\\n\\n David\u0027s hand tightened on the phone as he listened.\\n\\n \"No, it wasn\u0027t a waste of time,\" he said. \"Find the team that recovered the text and maybe they\u0027ll have a clue.\"\\n\\n David\u0027s eyes closed for a moment, but not before she saw a flash of grief shining behind his lashes. \"All of them? I thought Jasom lived.\"\\n\\n He leaned against the counter, looking more defeated with every word. \"Just what do you expect me to do out here?\\n\\n She\u0027s gone as far as she can with the intel we\u0027ve given her. You want us to start making things up?\"\\n\\n David clenched the phone so hard she thought the plastic housing would crack. \"No, sir,\" growled David. \"That won\u0027t be necessary. Just give me the coordinates of where the team found the script and I\u0027ll go there myself.\"\\n\\n The last piece of the puzzle fell into place in Noelle\u0027s head with a nearly audible click. \"That\u0027s it, David. The origin.\\n\\n It has to be from the perspective of whoever wrote this ciphertext. Where was it found?\"\\n\\n \"Hold on, sir,\" said David into he phone. To Noelle, he rattled off the coordinates that Monroe had just given him.\\n\\n Noelle hurriedly typed them into her program and hit the run button. She held her breath, waiting. A few seconds later, the results shone bright on her laptop screen. David was looking over her shoulder. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/no-regrets-delta-force-1/page-36.html","bookId":2374,"book":{"id":2374,"title":"No Regrets (Delta Force #1)","description":"Storyline: No Regrets (Delta Force #1) \\n Renowned cryptologist Noelle Blanche refuses to have blood on her hands.
