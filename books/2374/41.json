{"id":70261,"no":41,"title":"Page 41","content":"\"Fuck you, Stone.\" Caleb sighed and stood, his massive body towering over Noelle\u0027s bed. \"Don\u0027t be dumber than God made you, David. You love her and if you\u0027re smart, you\u0027ll let her know before it\u0027s too late. Don\u0027t walk away. You\u0027ll be sorry.\" That last part sounded too much like the voice of experience, making David wonder just what had happened to Caleb over the past two years. David stood and left the room, passing Grant on his way out. It was time to get moving. Noelle was going to be fine and he needed to be gone before she woke up. The least he could do for her was to be gone by the TSme she opened her eyes so she wouldn\u0027t have to see him again. And he wouldn\u0027t have to say good-bye. Noelle opened her eyes to find Grant and Caleb standing over her bed. \"Where\u0027s David?\" Grant\u0027s jaw clenched in anger and Caleb regarded her with an even, black stare. \"He\u0027s leaving. For good. I don\u0027t know whether or not you want to stop him, but you need to decide quick. He\u0027s got a three-minute head start, and once he\u0027s gone, none of us will ever be able to find him.\" Noelle fought down a sense of panic. \"Leaving? Why?\" \"He doesn\u0027t want you to end up like Mary did,\" said Grant. Noelle was still groggy, but she forced her mind to clear and take stock of what she\u0027d heard. She knew David felt guilty over his wife\u0027s death and likely over what had happened to her as well. She also knew that he was a total bonehead to think it was his fault. \"I can\u0027t let him go. I love him.\" \"You sure about this?\" asked Caleb. \"You need to think about what you\u0027re saying and be completely sure. Don\u0027t toy with him, Noelle.\" That last part was a warning, as clear and menacing as they got. \"Shut up! Which one of you is fastest?\" Grant smiled, vaulted over the bed in a casual, graceful leap and was out the door in a heartbeat. \"Help me up, Caleb.\" She used her best authoritative professorial voice. \"You\u0027re in no shape to be getting out of bed. Let Grant bring David back here.\" \"You really think Grant will be able to drag him back if he doesn\u0027t want to come?\" She was frantic now, throwing back the covers, trying not to rip the IV out of her hand. \"Caleb, I swear that if you don\u0027t help me up this instant, Fll use every single one of my massive brain cells to make you suffer for the rest of your life.\" An admiring grin curved Caleb\u0027s mouth, and he started to obey. He helped her stand on unsteady legs. Noelle wasn\u0027t sure how she would walk, but she was going to figure out something. Caleb stripped a blanket off the bed and wrapped it around her. \"As much as David would enjoy seeing your naked backside, I doubt he\u0027d enjoy sharing it with others. He\u0027s a little jealous when it comes to you, in case you hadn\u0027t noticed.\" \"Jealous enough that he\u0027s willing to leave me without even a good-bye kiss?\" Noelle started to unhook the tube from the IV, but Caleb stopped her. \"You need that.\" He took the bag from the metal stand and handed it to her. \"Here, you hold.this, and I\u0027ll carry you out. Seeing you in the arms of another man isn\u0027t going to make David happy.\" The grin on his face told Noelle just how much the idea of upsetting David appealed to him. He lifted her, blanket and all, and headed outside. David had almost made it to his car when he saw Grant barreling toward him. He guessed that Grant was coming to try to stop him from leaving, but a small, terrified part of him worried that something had happened to Noelle. He hesitated, and it was that hesitation that ended him flat on his back in the grass in front of the hospital parking lot. Adrenaline flooded his system and he shoved Grant off in a rush of strength. His elbow hit Grant\u0027s nose in the process and blood dripped down onto his buddy\u0027s gray T-shirt. If Grant noticed the injury, he didn\u0027t react. He just came toward David, his eyes glittering with joy. He slammed his body into David\u0027s, making air rush out of his lungs as he absorbed the force of the blow. Grant and David had grappled often enough during their training for David to know that they were evenly matched. Grant was a few inches taller but had nothing on David in the weight department. In a normal fight, David would have a fifty-fifty chance of winning. This was no normal fight. Grant\u0027s hand found the bullet wound in David\u0027s injured arm and squeezed. Pain speared through David\u0027s body and he ground his teeth to keep from crying out. \"That\u0027s for busting my nose. Again,\" said Grant. \"Stop that!\" ordered Noelle imperiously. David froze at the sound of her voice and looked toward her. She was cradled in Caleb\u0027s arms, swathed in a white cotton blanket, carrying her IV bag against her chest. Her face was bruised, and he could see it was an effort for her to keep her head upright. \"Get off me,\" shouted David. Immediately, Grant let go and stood offering David a hand up. David glared at Grant and refused his hand. Grant just grinned. The bastard had always enjoyed fighting too much for his own good. David\u0027s first instinct was to rush to Noelle\u0027s side, but he bit back the urge and planted his feet a good two yards away from her. \"I didn\u0027t tell you to hurt him, Grant,\" Noelle scolded. \"Just to stop him.\" Grant gave her a sheepish smile. \"Sorry, ma\u0027am. I guess I just got carried away.\" Her green gaze fastened on David and it was like taking a punch in the gut. Betrayal shone in her eyes. \"You were just going to leave?\" she asked. David wanted to murder Caleb, knowing he was the one who had told her that. It would have been so much better if he\u0027d just kept his mouth shut. \"I have to, Noelle. It\u0027s for your own good.\" Her mouth tightened into an angry circle. \"Don\u0027t you tell me what\u0027s for my own good! I\u0027m a grown woman and fully capable of deciding what I want and don\u0027t want. If you\u0027re leaving because you don\u0027t give a shit about me, then go, but don\u0027t try to tell me that it\u0027s for my own good.\" The effort of shouting at him sapped her strength visibly. She leaned her head against Caleb\u0027s chest and the surge of jealousy that ripped through David had him clenching his fists against the urge to slam them into Caleb\u0027s face. \"Put my woman down,\" growled David. Caleb lifted a black brow. \"She\u0027s too weak to stand. You want me to put her down, come take her from me. Otherwise, suffer.\" David debated leaving her with Caleb, but he was so damn jealous he couldn\u0027t think straight, seeing her in another man\u0027s arms. It was stupid to think of her as his. After all, he was leaving as soon as he straightened things out with Noelle. He knew that eventually, some other man would find out what a treasure she was and marry her. He wouldn\u0027t be anywhere around to stop it from happening, either. It was best if he just got used to the idea of her belonging to another man. Maybe even Caleb. That was the thought that sent him over the edge, and he knew that Caleb had seen it in his face. David stalked over the grass and took Noelle from Caleb. He was careful of her battered body, but the glare he gave Caleb was a clear dismissal. Noelle held herself stiff and uncertain, but David couldn\u0027t blame her. He\u0027d hurt her feelings and probably a lot more than that. \"I think you owe me an explanation as to why you were leaving without saying good-bye,\" she said. David refused to look down at her. He knew that look of betrayal was still twisting her face, making him ache deep in his gut for what he had to do to her. \"Let\u0027s get you back in bed. We\u0027ll talk there.\" \"I\u0027ll stand guard at the door,\" offered Grant in a cheerful tone, wiping blood from his face. \"Just in case he decides to sneak away again.\" David growled, but made no comment. It was too cold outside for Noelle to be out here in just a flimsy hospital gown and a blanket. He said nothing as he tucked her back in bed and hung the IV bag back on the metal stand. Once he was done, he put some distance between them, pacing at the end of her bed. \"Well?\" she asked. Her voice was strained. Tired. Hurt. David wanted to slam his fist into somethingâ€” preferably his friends\u0027 faces. He felt trapped. Caged by guilt and responsibility. He knew what he had to do, it was just so damn hard to walk away from her now that she was awake, he wasn\u0027t sure he would be strong enough. He didn\u0027t dare look at her, but focused on the square vinyl tiles at his feet. \"We can\u0027t be together. It\u0027s too dangerous for you. You nearly ended up dead. There\u0027s no guarantee it won\u0027t happen again. Only next time, you might not make it.\" \"But I did make it. You saved me.\" The image of Mary\u0027s body flashed through his thoughts. \"It doesn\u0027t always work like that. It\u0027s safest if we\u0027re not together.\" \"Don\u0027t you think that should be my decision? I\u0027m pretty smart. I have been known to make an informed decision on my own upon occasion.\" \"Not this one.\" \"Why not? Don\u0027t you trust my judgment?\" \"It has nothing to do with judgment.\" \"Is this just your way of telling me that you\u0027re not interested in seeing me anymore? You fucked me and now you\u0027re done?\" Anger seethed inside him at her crude, completely mistaken words, eating at his control. \"Hell, no\u0027.\" \u0027Then if you\u0027re not just trying to blow me off, why were you running?\" \"I can\u0027t let you get hurt again.\" He finally looked at her, seeing every ounce of weariness outnumbered by two of determination. She wasn\u0027t going to make this easy on him, not that walking away from her ever could have been easy. She regarded him with a hard stare. \"And who\u0027s to say that if you leave I\u0027ll be safe? You yourself said that my life would always be at risk from those who want to use what I know. I\u0027ll always be in danger. It\u0027s something I\u0027m going to need to learn to live with so I can protect myself.\" \"You\u0027ll be safer without me.\" His voice was sharp with resolve. \"So, what you\u0027re saying is that even though I\u0027ll still be in danger, if you\u0027re not around, at least you won\u0027t be the one responsible if I get killed. Your hands will be clean. You won\u0027t have to worry about feeling all that guilt that you\u0027ve felt over Mary\u0027s death.\" Something primal and frightening rose up inside him and he could feel his eyes burning with anger. \"You\u0027re not going to get killed! Ever.\" \"You can\u0027t guarantee that. No one can. In fact, I could get into a car to drive home and be smashed flat on the highway and there would be nothing you could do to stop it. Nothing! Just like there was nothing you could have done to keep Mary alive.\" Mary. And now Noelle. Oh, God. He was never going to be able to stay sane under the weight of his crushing guilt. He had to get away. Shut down his emotions. It was the only way he was going to survive. \"It\u0027s not the same thing.\" Her green eyes flared with rage. \"Bullshit! It\u0027s exactly the same thing. You weren\u0027t there and Mary was taken. What if she\u0027d been killed in a car wreck because you weren\u0027t there to go to the store for her? What if she\u0027d slipped on some ice and died from head trauma because you weren\u0027t there to walk her to work every day. You can\u0027t be everywhere, David! You can\u0027t be responsible for everyone. It\u0027s not your job to keep everyone alive.\" Part of what she was saying hit home, but he refused to dwell on it He bad to make her understand. \"I never wanted to keep everyone alive. Just the people I love. There aren\u0027t many of them. It shouldn\u0027t have been too much to ask.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/no-regrets-delta-force-1/page-41.html","bookId":2374,"book":{"id":2374,"title":"No Regrets (Delta Force #1)","description":"Storyline: No Regrets (Delta Force #1) Renowned cryptologist Noelle Blanche refuses to have blood on her hands.
