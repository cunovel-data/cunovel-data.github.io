Then Augustus got up and banged the door. \"Don\u0027t be angry because I sometimes forget that I am no longer considered to be your elder brother,\" said Mountjoy. \"Bother about elder brothers! I suppose you can shut a door?\" \"A man is sometimes compelled by circumstances to think whether he can or not. I\u0027d\u0027ve shut the door for you readily enough the other day. I don\u0027t know that I can now. Ain\u0027t we going to have some dinner? It\u0027s eight o\u0027clock.\" \"I suppose they\u0027ll get dinner for you;—I\u0027m not going to dine here.\" The two men were both dressed and after this they remained silent for the next five minutes. Then the servant came in and said that dinner was ready. All this happened in December. It must be explained that the captain had come to London at his brother\u0027s instance, and was there, in his rooms, at his invitation. Indeed, we may say that he had come at his brother\u0027s command. Augustus had during the last few months taken upon himself to direct the captain\u0027s movements; and though he had not always been obeyed, still, upon the whole, his purposes had been carried out as well as he could expect. He had offered to supply the money necessary for the captain\u0027s tour, and had absolutely sent a servant to accompany the traveller. When the traveller had won money at Monaco he had been unruly, but this had not happened very often. When we last saw him he had expressed his intention to Mr. Hart of making a return journey to the Caucasian provinces. But he got no farther than Genoa on his way to the Caucasus, and then, when he found that Mr. Hart was not at his back, he turned round and went back to Monte Carlo. Monte Carlo, of all places on the world\u0027s surface, had now charms for him. There was no longer a club open to him, either in London or Paris, at which he could win or lose one hundred pounds. At Monte Carlo he could still do so readily; and, to do so, need not sink down into any peculiarly low depth of social gathering. At Monte Carlo the ennui of the day was made to disappear. At Monte Carlo he could lie in bed till eleven, and then play till dinner-time. At Monte Carlo there was always some one who would drink a glass of wine with him without inquiring too closely as to his antecedents. He had begun by winning a large sum of money. He had got some sums from his brother, and when at last he was summoned home he was penniless. Had his pocket been still full of money it may be doubted whether he would have come, although he understood perfectly the importance of the matter on which he had been recalled. He had been sent for in order that he might receive from Mr. Grey a clear statement of what it was intended to do in reference to the payment of money to the creditors. Mr. Grey had, in the first place, endeavored to assure him that his co-operation was in no respect made necessary by the true circumstances of the case, but in order to satisfy the doubts of certain persons. The money to be paid was the joint property of his father and his brother,—of his father, as far as the use of it for his life was concerned, and of his brother, as to its continued and perpetual enjoyment. They were willing to pay so much for the redemption of the bonds given by him, the captain. As far as these bonds were concerned the captain would thus be a free man. There could be no doubt that nothing but benefit was intended for him,—as though he were himself the heir. \"Though as to that I have no hesitation in telling you that, you will at your father\u0027s death have no right to a shilling of the property.\" The captain had said that he was quite willing, and had signed the deed. He was glad that these bonds should be recovered so cheaply. But as to the property,—and here he spoke with much spirit to Mr. Grey,—it was his purpose at his father\u0027s death to endeavor to regain his position. He would never believe, he said, that his mother was—Then he turned away, and, in spite of all that had come and gone, Mr. Grey respected him. But he had signed the deed, and the necessity for his presence was over. What should his brother do with him now? He could not keep him concealed,—or not concealed,—in his rooms. But something must be done. Some mode of living must be invented for him. Abroad! Augustus said to himself,—and to Septimus Jones, who was his confidential friend,—that Mountjoy must live \"abroad.\" \"Oh yes; he must go abroad. There\u0027s no doubt about that. It\u0027s the only place for him.\" So spoke Septimus Jones, who, though confidential friend, was not admitted to the post of confidential adviser. Augustus liked to have a depositary for his resolutions, but would admit no advice. And Septimus Jones had become so much his creature that he had to obey him in all things. We are apt to think that a man may be disposed of by being made to go abroad; or, if he is absolutely penniless and useless, by being sent to the colonies,—that he may become a shepherd and drink himself out of the world. To kill the man, so that he may be no longer a nuisance, is perhaps the chief object in both cases. But it was not easy to get the captain to go abroad unless, indeed, he was sent back to Monte Carlo. Some Monte Carlo, such as a club might be with stakes practically unlimited, was the first desire of his heart. But behind that, or together with it, was an anxious longing to remain near Tretton and \"see it out,\" as he called it, when his father should die. His father must die very shortly, and he would like \"to see it out,\" as he told Mr. Grey; and, with this wish, there was a longing also for the company of Florence Mountjoy. He used to tell himself, in those moments of sad thoughts,—thoughts serious as well as sad, which will come even to a gambler,—that if he could have Tretton and Florence Mountjoy he would never touch another card. And there was present to him an assurance that his aunt, Mrs. Mountjoy, would still be on his side. If he could talk over his circumstances with Mrs. Mountjoy, he thought that he might be encouraged to recover his position as an English gentleman. His debts at the club had already been paid, and he had met on the sly a former friend, who had given him some hope that he might be re-admitted. But at the present moment his mind turned to Brussels. He had learned that Florence and her mother were at the embassy there, and, though he hesitated, still he desired to go. But this was not the \"abroad\" contemplated by Augustus. Augustus did not think it well that his father\u0027s bastard son, who had been turned out of a London club for not paying his card debts, and had then disappeared in a mysterious way for six months, should show himself at the British embassy, and there claim admittance and relationship. Nor was he anxious that his brother should see Florence Mountjoy. He had suggested a prolonged tour in South America, which he had declared to be the most interesting country in the world. \"I think I had rather go to Brussels,\" Mountjoy had answered, gallantly, keeping his seat in the arm-chair and picking his teeth the while. This occurred on the evening before that on which we found them just now. On the morning of that day Mountjoy had had his interview with Mr. Grey. Augustus had declared that he intended to dine out. This he had said in disgust at his brother\u0027s behavior. No doubt he could get his dinner at ten minutes\u0027 notice. He had not been expelled from his club. But he had ordered the dinner on that day with a view to eat it himself, and in effect he carried out his purpose. The captain got up, thinking to go alone when the dinner was announced, but expressed himself gratified when his brother said that he \"had changed his mind.\" \"You made yourself such an ass about shutting the door that I resolved to leave you to yourself. But come along.\" And he accompanied the captain into the other room. A very pretty little dinner was prepared,—quite such as one loving friend might give to another, when means are sufficient,—such a dinner as the heir of Tretton might have given to his younger brother. The champagne was excellent, and the bottle of Leoville. Mountjoy partook of all the good things with much gusto, thinking all the while that he ought to have been giving the dinner to his younger brother. When that conversation had sprung up about going to Brussels or South America, Mountjoy had suggested a loan. \"I\u0027ll pay your fare to Rio, and give you an order on a banker there.\" Mountjoy had replied that that would not at all suit his purpose. Then Augustus had felt that it would be almost better to send his brother even to Brussels than to keep him concealed in London. He had been there now for three or four days, and, even in respect of his maintenance, had become a burden. The pretty little dinners had to be found every day, and were eaten by the captain alone, when left alone, without an attempt at an apology on his part. Augustus had begun with some intention of exhibiting his mode of life. He would let his brother know what it was to be the heir of Tretton. No doubt he did assume all the outward glitter of his position, expecting to fill his brother\u0027s heart with envy. But Mountjoy had seen and understood it all; and remembering the days, not long removed, when he had been the heir, he bethought himself that he had never shown off before his brother. And he was determined to express no gratitude or thankfulness. He would go on eating the little dinners exactly as though they had been furnished by himself. It certainly was dull. There was no occupation for him, and in the matter of pocket-money he was lamentably ill-supplied. But he was gradually becoming used to face the streets again and had already entered the shops of one or two of his old tradesmen. He had quite a confidential conversation with his boot-maker, and had ordered three or four new pairs of boots. Nobody could tell how the question of the property would be decided till his father should have died. His father had treated him most cruelly, and he would only wait for his death. He could assure the boot-maker that when that time came he should look for his rights. He knew that there was a suspicion abroad that he was in a conspiracy with his father and brother to cheat his creditors. No such thing. He himself was cheated. He pledged himself to the boot-maker that, to the best of his belief, his father was robbing him, and that he would undoubtedly assert his right to the Tretton property as soon as the breath should be out of his father\u0027s body. The truth of what he told the boot-maker he certainly did believe. There was some little garnishing added to his tale,—which, perhaps, under the circumstances, was to be forgiven. The blow had come upon him so suddenly, he said, that he was not able even to pay his card account, and had left town in dismay at the mine which had been exploded under his feet. The boot-maker believed him so far that he undertook to supply his orders. When the dinner had been eaten the two brothers lit their cigars and drew to the fire. \"There must, unfortunately, come an end to this, you know,\" said Augustus. \"I certainly can\u0027t stand it much longer,\" said Mountjoy. \"You, at any rate, have had the best of it. I have endeavored to make my little crib comfortable for you.\" \"The grub is good, and the wine. There\u0027s no doubt about that. Somebody says somewhere that nobody can live upon bread alone. That includes the whole menu, I suppose.\" \"What do you suggest to do with yourself?\" \"You said, go abroad.\" \"So I did—to Rio.\" \"Rio is a long way off,—somewhere across the equator, isn\u0027t it?\" \"I believe it is.\" \"I think we\u0027d better have it out clearly between us, Augustus. It won\u0027t suit me to be at Rio Janeiro when our father dies.\" \"What difference will his death make to you?\" \"A father\u0027s death generally does make a difference to his eldest son, particularly if there is any property concerned.\" \"You mean to say that you intend to dispute the circumstances of your birth?\" \"Dispute them! Do you think that I will allow such a thing to be said of my mother without disputing it? Do you suppose that I will give up my claim to one of the finest properties in England without disputing it?\" \"Then I had better stop the payment of that money, and let the gentlemen know that you mean to raise the question on their behalf.\" \"That\u0027s your affair. The arrangement is a very good one for me; but you made it.\" \"You know very well that your present threat means nothing. Ask Mr. Grey. You can trust him.\" \"But I can\u0027t trust him. After having been so wickedly deceived by my own father, I can trust no one. Why did not Mr. Grey find it out before, if it be true? I give you my word, Augustus, the lawyers will have to fight it out before you will be allowed to take possession.\" \"And yet you do not scruple to come and live here at my cost.\" \"Not in the least. At whose cost can I live with less scruple than at yours? You, at any rate, have not robbed our mother of her good name, as my father has done. The only one of the family with whom I could not stay is the governor. I could not sit at the table with a man who has so disgraced himself.\" \"Upon my word I am very much obliged to you for the honor you do me.\" \"That\u0027s my feeling. The chance of the game and his villany have given you for the moment the possession of all the good things. They are all mine by rights.\" \"Cards have had nothing to do with it.\" \"Yes; they have. But they have had nothing to do with my being the eldest legitimate son of my father. The cards have been against me, but they have not affected my mother. Then there came the blow from the governor, and where was I to look for my bread but to you? I suppose, if the truth be known, you get the money from the governor.\" \"Of course I do. But not for your maintenance.\" \"On what does he suppose that I have been living since last June? It mayn\u0027t be in the bond, but I suppose he has made allowance for my maintenance. Do you mean to say that I am not to have bread-and-cheese out of Tretton?\" \"If I were to turn you out of these rooms you\u0027d find it very difficult to get it.\" \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll do that.\" \"I\u0027m not so sure.\" \"You\u0027re meditating it,—are you? I shouldn\u0027t go just at present, because I have not got a sovereign in the world. I was going to speak to you about money. You must let me have some.\" \"Upon my word, I like your impudence!\" \"What the devil am I to do? The governor has asked me to go down to Tretton, and I can\u0027t go without a five-pound note in my pocket.\" \"The governor has asked you to Tretton?\" \"Why not? I got a letter from him this morning.\" Then Augustus asked to see the letter, but Mountjoy refused to show it. From this there arose angry words, and Augustus told his brother that he did not believe him. \"Not believe me? You do believe me! You know that what I say is the truth, He has asked me with all his usual soft soap. But I have refused to go. I told him that I could not go to the house of one who had injured my mother so seriously.\" All that Mountjoy said as to the proposed visit to Tretton was true. The squire had written to him without mentioning the name of Augustus, and had told him that, for the present, Tretton would be the best home for him. \"I will do what I can to make you happy, but you will not see a card,\" the squire had said. It was not the want of cards which prevented Mountjoy, but a feeling on his part that for the future there could be nothing but war between him and his father. It was out of the question that he should accept his father\u0027s hospitality without telling him of his intention, and he did not know his father well enough to feel that such a declaration would not affect him at all. He had, therefore, declined. Then Harry Annesley\u0027s name was mentioned. \"I think I\u0027ve done for that fellow,\" said Augustus. \"What have you done?\" \"I\u0027ve cooked his goose. In the first place, his uncle has stopped his allowance, and in the second place the old fellow is going to marry a wife. At any rate, he has quarrelled with Master Harry á outrance. Master Harry has gone back to the parental parsonage, and is there eating the bread of affliction and drinking the waters of poverty. Flossy Mountjoy may marry him if she pleases. A girl may marry a man now without leave from anybody. But if she does my dear cousin will have nothing to eat.\" \"And you have done this?\" \"\u0027Alone I did it, boy.\u0027\" \"Then it\u0027s an infernal shame. What harm had he ever done you? For me I had some ground of quarrel with him, but for you there was none.\" \"I have my own quarrel with him also.\" \"I quarrelled with him—with a cause. I do not care if I quarrel with him again. He shall never marry Florence Mountjoy if I can help it. But to rob a fellow of his property I think a very shabby thing.\" Then Augustus got up and walked out of the chambers into the street, and Mountjoy soon followed him. \"I must make him understand that he must leave this at once,\" said Augustus to himself, \"and if necessary I must order the supplies to be cut off.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2755/75976.html","bookId":1347,"book":{"id":1347,"title":"Mr. Scarborough\u0027s Family","description":"简介： It will be necessary, for the purpose of my story, that I shall go back more than once from the point at which it begins, so that I may explain with the least amount of awkwardness the things as they occurred, which led up to the incidents that I am...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2755","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:54 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:54 AM"}}
