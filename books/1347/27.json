{"id":18345,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER XXVII. THE PROPOSAL.","content":"It had never happened to him before. The first thought that came upon Mr. Prosper, when he got into his carriage, was that it had never occurred to him before. He did not reflect that he had not put himself in the way of it: but now the strangeness of the sensation overwhelmed him. He inquired of himself whether it was pleasant, but he found himself compelled to answer the question with a negative. It should have come from him, but not yet; not yet, probably, for some weeks. But it had been done, and by the doing of it she had sealed him utterly as her own. There was no getting out of it now. He did feel that he ought not to attempt to get out of it after what had taken place. He was not sure but that the lady had planned it all with that purpose; but he was sure that a strong foundation had been laid for a breach of promise case if he were to attempt to escape. What might not a jury do against him, giving damages out of the acres of Buston Hall? And then Miss Thoroughbung would go over to the other Thoroughbungs and to the Annesleys, and his condition would become intolerable. In some moments, as he was driven home, he was not sure but that it had all been got up as a plot against him by the Annesleys. \\n\\n \\n\\n When he got out of his carriage Matthew knew that things had gone badly with his master; but he could not conjecture in what way. The matter had been fully debated in the kitchen, and it had been there decided that Miss Thoroughbung was certainly to be brought home as the future mistress of Buston. The step to be taken by their master was not popular in the Buston kitchen. It had been there considered that Master Harry was to be the future master, and, by some perversity of intellect, they had all thought that this would occur soon. Matthew was much older than the squire, who was hardly to be called a sickly man, and yet Matthew had made up his mind that Mr. Harry was to reign over him as Squire of Buston. When, therefore, the tidings came that Miss Thoroughbung was to brought to Buston as the mistress, there had been some slight symptoms of rebellion. \"They didn\u0027t want any \u0027Tilda Thoroughbung there.\" They had their own idea of a lady and a gentleman, which, as in all such cases, was perfectly correct. They knew the squire to be a fool, but they believed him to be a gentleman. They heard that Miss Thoroughbung was a clever woman, but they did not believe her to be a lady. Matthew had said a few words to the cook as to a public-house at Stevenage. She had told him not to be an old fool, and that he would lose his money, but she had thought of the public-house. There had been a mutinous feeling. Matthew helped his master out of the carriage, and then came a revulsion. That \"froth of a beer-barrel,\" as Matthew had dared to call her, had absolutely refused his master. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Prosper went into the house very meditative, and sad at heart. It was a matter almost of regret to him that it had not been as Matthew supposed. But he was caught and bound, and must make the best of it. He thought of all the particulars of her proposed mode of living, and recapitulated them to himself. A pair of ponies, her own maid, champagne, the fish-monger\u0027s bill, and Miss Tickle. Miss Puffle would certainly not have required such expensive luxuries. Champagne and the fish would require company for their final consumption. \\n\\n \\n\\n The ponies assumed a tone of being quite opposed to that which he had contemplated. He questioned with himself whether he would like Miss Tickle as a perpetual inmate. He had, in sheer civility, expressed a liking for Miss Tickle, but what need could there be to a married woman of a Miss Tickle? And then he thought of the education of the five or six children which she had almost promised him! He had suggested to himself simply an heir,—just one heir,—so that the nefarious Harry might be cut out. He already saw that he would not be enriched to the extent of a shilling by the lady\u0027s income. Then there would be all the trouble and the disgrace of a separate purse. He felt that there would be disgrace in having the fish and champagne, which were consumed in his own house,—paid for by his wife without reference to him. What if the lady had a partiality for champagne? He knew nothing about it, and would know nothing about it, except when he saw it in her heightened color. Despatched crabs for supper! He always went to bed at ten, and had a tumbler of barley-water brought to him,—a glass of barley-water with just a squeeze of lemon-juice. \\n\\n \\n\\n He saw ruin before him. No doubt she was a good manager, but she would be a good manager for herself. Would it not be better for him to stand the action for breach of promise, and betake himself to Miss Puffle? But Miss Puffle was fifty, and there could be no doubt that the lady ought to be younger than the gentleman. He was much distressed in mind. If he broke off with Miss Thoroughbung, ought he to do so at once, before she had had time to put the matter into the hands of the lawyer? And on what plea should he do it? Before he went to bed that night he did draw out a portion of a letter, which, however, was never sent: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"MY DEAR MISS THOROUGHBUNG,—In the views which we both promulgated this morning I fear that there was some essential misunderstanding as to the mode of life which had occurred to both of us. You, as was so natural at your age, and with your charms, have not been slow to anticipate a coming period of uncheckered delights. Your allusion to a pony-carriage, and other incidental allusions,\"—he did not think it well to mention more particularly the fish and the champagne,—\"have made clear the sort of future life which you have pictured to yourself. Heaven forbid that I should take upon myself to find fault with anything so pleasant and so innocent! But my prospects of life are different, and in seeking the honor of an alliance with you I was looking for a quiet companion in my declining years, and it might be also to a mother to a possible future son. When you honored me with an unmistakable sign of your affection, on my going, I was just about to explain all this. You must excuse me if my mouth was then stopped by the mutual ardor of our feeling. I was about to say—\" But he had found it difficult to explain what he had been about to say, and on the next morning, when the time for writing had come, he heard news which detained him for the day, and then the opportunity was gone. \\n\\n \\n\\n On the following morning, when Matthew appeared at his bedside with his cup of tea at nine o\u0027clock, tidings were brought him. He took in the Buntingford Gazette, which came twice a week, and as Matthew laid it, opened and unread, in its accustomed place, he gave the information, which he had no doubt gotten from the paper. \"You haven\u0027t heard it, sir, I suppose, as yet?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Heard what?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"About Miss Puffle.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What about Miss Puffle? I haven\u0027t heard a word. What about Miss Puffle?\" He had been thinking that moment of Miss Puffle,—of how she would be superior to Miss Thoroughbung in many ways,—so that he sat up in his bed, holding the untasted tea in his hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She\u0027s gone off with young Farmer Tazlehurst.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Miss Puffle gone off, and with her father\u0027s tenant\u0027s son!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes indeed, sir. She and her father have been quarrelling for the last ten years, and now she\u0027s off. She was always riding and roistering about the country with them dogs and them men; and now she\u0027s gone.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh heavens!\" exclaimed the squire, thinking of his own escape. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, indeed, sir. There\u0027s no knowing what any one of them is up to. Unless they gets married afore they\u0027re thirty, or thirty-five at most, they\u0027re most sure to get such ideas into their head as no one can mostly approve.\" This had been intended by Matthew as a word of caution to his master, but had really the opposite effect. He resolved at the moment that the latter should not be said of Miss Thoroughbung. \\n\\n \\n\\n And he turned Matthew out of the room with a flea in his ear. \"How dare you speak in that way of your betters? Mr. Puffle, the lady\u0027s father, has for many years been my friend. I am not saying anything of the lady, nor saying that she has done right. Of course, down-stairs, in the servants\u0027 hall, you can say what you please; but up here, in my presence, you should not speak in such language of a lady behind whose chair you may be called upon to wait.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very well, sir; I won\u0027t no more,\" said Matthew, retiring with mock humility. But he had shot his bolt, and he supposed successfully. He did not know what had taken place between his master and Miss Thoroughbung; but he did think that his speech might assist in preventing a repetition of the offer. \\n\\n \\n\\n Miss Puffle gone off with the tenant\u0027s son! The news made matrimony doubly dangerous to him, and yet robbed him of the chief reason by which he was to have been driven to send her a letter. He could not, at any rate, now fall back upon Miss Puffle. And he thought that nothing would have induced Miss Thoroughbung to go off with one of the carters from the brewery. Whatever faults she might have, they did not lie in that direction. Champagne and ponies were, as faults, less deleterious. \\n\\n \\n\\n Miss Puffle gone off with young Tazlehurst,—a lady of fifty, with a young man of twenty-five! and she the reputed heiress of Snickham Manor! It was a comfort to him as he remembered that Snickham Manor had been bought no longer ago than by the father of the present owner. The Prospers been at Buston ever since the time of George the First. You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow\u0027s ear. He had been ever assuring himself of that fact, which was now more of a fact than ever. And fifty years old! It was quite shocking. With a steady middle-aged man like himself, and with the approval of her family, marriage might have been thought of. But this harum-scarum young tenant\u0027s son, who was in no respect a gentleman, whose only thought was of galloping over hedges and ditches, such an idea showed a state of mind which—well, absolutely disgusted him. Mr. Prosper, because he had grown old himself, could not endure to think that others, at his age, should retain a smack of their youth. There are ladies besides Miss Puffle who like to ride across the country with a young man before them, or perhaps following, and never think much of their fifty years. \\n\\n \\n\\n But the news certainly brought to him a great change of feelings, so that the letter to which he had devoted the preceding afternoon was put back into the letter-case, and was never finished. And his mind immediately recurred to Miss Thoroughbung, and he bethought himself that the objection which he felt was, perhaps, in part frivolous. At any rate, she was a better woman than Miss Puffle. She certainly would run after no farmer\u0027s son. Though she might be fond of champagne, it was, he thought, chiefly for other people. Though she was ambitious of ponies, the ambition might be checked. At any rate, she could pay for her own ponies, whereas Mr. Puffle was a very hale old man of seventy. Puffle, he told himself, had married young, and might live for the next ten years, or twenty. To Mr. Prosper, whose imagination did not fly far afield, the world afforded at present but two ladies. These were Miss Puffle and Miss Thoroughbung, and as Miss Puffle had fallen out of the running, there seemed to be a walk-over for Miss Thoroughbung. \\n\\n \\n\\n He did think, during the two or three days which passed without any farther step on his part,—he did think how it might be were he to remain unmarried. As regarded his own comfort, he was greatly tempted. Life would remain so easy to him! But then duty demanded of him that he should marry, and he was a man who, in honest, sober talk, thought much of his duty. He was absurdly credulous, and as obstinate as a mule. But he did wish to do what was right. He had been convinced that Harry Annesley was a false knave, and had been made to swear an oath that Harry should not be his heir. Harry had been draped in the blackest colors, and to each daub of black something darker had been added by his uncle\u0027s memory of those neglected sermons. It was now his first duty in life to beget an heir, and for that purpose a wife must be had. \\n\\n \\n\\n Putting aside the ponies and the champagne,—and the despatched crab, the sound of which, as coming to him from Miss Tickle\u0027s mouth, was uglier than the other sounds,—he still thought that Miss Thoroughbung would answer his purpose. From her side there would not be making of a silk purse; but then \"the boy\" would be his boy as well as hers, and would probably take more after the father. He passed much of these days with the \"Peerage\" in his hand, and satisfied himself that the best blood had been maintained frequently by second-rate marriages. Health was a great thing. Health in the mother was everything. Who could be more healthy than Miss Thoroughbung? Then he thought of that warm embrace. Perhaps, after all, it was right that she should embrace him after what he had said to her. \\n\\n \\n\\n Three days only had passed by, and he was still thinking what ought to be his next step, when there came to him a letter from Messrs. Soames \u0026 Simpson, attorneys in Buntingford. He had heard of Messrs. Soames \u0026 Simpson, had been familiar with their names for the last twenty years, but had never dreamed that his own private affairs should become a matter of consultation in their office. Messrs. Grey \u0026 Barry, of Lincoln\u0027s Inn, were his lawyers, who were quite gentlemen. He knew nothing against Messrs. Soames \u0026 Simpson, but he thought that their work consisted generally in the recovery of local debts. Messrs. Soames \u0026 Simpson now wrote to him with full details as to his future life. Their client Miss Thoroughbung, had communicated to them his offer of marriage. They were acquainted with all the lady\u0027s circumstances, and she had asked them for their advice. They had proposed to her that the use of her own income should be by deed left to herself. Some proportion of it should go into the house, and might be made matter of agreement. They suggested that an annuity of a thousand pounds a year, in shape of dower, should be secured to their client in the event of her outliving Mr. Prosper. The estate should, of course, be settled on the eldest child. The mother\u0027s property should be equally divided among the other children. Buston Hall should be the residence of the widow till the eldest son should be twenty-four, after which Mr. Prosper would no doubt feel that their client would have to provide a home for herself. Messrs. Soames \u0026 Simpson did not think that there was anything in this to which Mr. Prosper would object, and if this were so, they would immediately prepare the settlement. \"That woman didn\u0027t say against it, after all,\" said Matthew to himself as he gave the letter from the lawyers to his master. \\n\\n \\n\\n The letter made Mr. Prosper very angry. It did, in truth, contain nothing more than a repetition of the very terms which the lady had herself suggested; but coming to him through these local lawyers it was doubly distasteful. What was he to do? He felt it to be out of the question to accede at once. Indeed, he had a strong repugnance to putting himself into communication with the Buntingford lawyers. Had the matter been other than it was, he would have gone to the rector for advice. The rector generally advised him. \\n\\n \\n\\n But that was out of the question now. He had seen his sister once since his visit to Buntingford, but had said nothing to her about it. Indeed, he had been anything but communicative, so that Mrs. Annesley had been forced to leave him with a feeling almost of offense. There was no help to be had in that quarter, and he could only write to Mr. Grey, and ask that gentleman to assist him in his difficulties. \\n\\n \\n\\n He did write to Mr. Grey, begging for his immediate attention. \"There is that fool Prosper going to marry a brewer\u0027s daughter down at Buntingford,\" said Mr. Grey to his daughter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s sixty years old.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, my love. He looks it, but he\u0027s only fifty. A man at fifty is supposed to be young enough to marry. There\u0027s a nephew who has been brought up as his heir; that\u0027s the hard part of it. And the nephew is mixed up in some way with the Scarboroughs.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is it he who is to marry that young lady?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think it is. And now there\u0027s some devil\u0027s play going on. I\u0027ve got nothing to do with it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But you will have.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not a turn. Mr. Prosper can marry if he likes it. They have sent him most abominable proposals as to the lady\u0027s money; and as to her jointure, I must stop that if I can, though I suppose he is not such a fool as to give way.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is he soft?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, not exactly. He likes his own money. But he\u0027s a gentleman, and wants nothing but what is or ought to be his own.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There are but few like that now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s true of him. But then he does not know what is his own, or what ought to be. He\u0027s almost the biggest fool I have ever known, and will do an injustice to that boy simply from ignorance.\" Then he drafted his letter to Mr. Prosper, and gave it to Dolly to read. \"That\u0027s what I shall propose. The clerk can put it into proper language. He must offer less than he means to give.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is that honest, father?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s honest on my part, knowing the people with whom I have to deal. If I were to lay down the strict minimum which he should grant, he would add other things which would cause him to act not in accordance with my advice. I have to make allowance for his folly,—a sort of windage, which is not dishonest. Had he referred her lawyers to me I could have been as hard and honest as you please.\" All which did not quite satisfy Dolly\u0027s strict ideas of integrity. \\n\\n \\n\\n But the terms proposed were that the lady\u0027s means should be divided so that one-half should go to herself for her own personal expenses, and the other half to her husband for the use of the house; that the lady should put up with a jointure of two hundred and fifty pounds, which ought to suffice when joined to her own property, and that the settlement among the children should be as recommended by Messrs. Soames \u0026 Simpson. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And if there are not any children, papa?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then each will receive his or her own property.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because it may be so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Certainly, my dear; very probably.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2755/75966.html","bookId":1347,"book":{"id":1347,"title":"Mr. Scarborough\u0027s Family","description":"简介： It will be necessary, for the purpose of my story, that I shall go back more than once from the point at which it begins, so that I may explain with the least amount of awkwardness the things as they occurred, which led up to the incidents that I am...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2755","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:54 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:54 AM"}}
