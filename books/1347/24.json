{"id":18342,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV. HARRY ANNESLEY\u0027S MISERY.","content":"The conversation which took place that evening between Harry and his father was more serious in its language, though not more important in its purpose. \"This is bad news, Harry,\" said the rector. \"Yes, indeed, sir.\"\u0027 \"Your uncle, no doubt, can do as he pleases.\" \"You mean as to the income he has allowed me?\" \"As to the income! As to the property itself. It is bad waiting for dead men\u0027s shoes.\" \"And yet it is what everybody does in this world. No one can say that I have been at all in a hurry to step into my uncle\u0027s shoes. It was he that first told you that he should never marry, and as the property had been entailed on me, he undertook to bring me up as his son.\" \"So he did.\" \"Not a doubt about it, sir. But I had nothing to say to it. As far as I understand, he has been allowing me two hundred and fifty pounds a year for the last dozen years.\" \"Ever since you went to the Charter-house.\" \"At that time I could not be expected to have a word to say to it. And it has gone on ever since.\" \"Yes, it has gone on ever since.\" \"And when I was leaving Cambridge he required that I should not go into a profession.\" \"Not exactly that, Harry.\" \"It was so that I understood it. He did not wish his heir to be burdened with a profession. He said so to me himself.\" \"Yes, just when he was in his pride because you had got your fellowship. But there was a contract understood, if not made.\" \"What contract?\" asked Harry, with an air of surprise. \"That you should be to him as a son.\" \"I never undertook it. I wouldn\u0027t have done it at the price,—or for any price. I never felt for him the respect or the love that were due to a father. I did feel both of them, to the full, for my own father. They are a sort of a thing which we cannot transfer.\" \"They may be shared, Harry,\" said the rector, who was flattered. \"No, sir; in this instance that was not possible.\" \"You might have sat by while he read a sermon to his sister and nieces. You understood his vanity, and you wounded it, knowing what you were doing. I don\u0027t mean to blame you, but it was a misfortune. Now we must look it in the face and see what must be done. Your mother has told you that he has written to me. There is his letter. You will see that he writes with a fixed purpose.\" Then he handed to Harry a letter written on a large sheet of paper, the reading of which would be so long that Harry seated himself for the operation. The letter need not here be repeated at length. It was written with involved sentences, but in very decided language. It said nothing of Harry\u0027s want of duty, or not attending to the sermons, or of other deficiencies of a like nature, but based his resolution in regard to stopping the income on his nephew\u0027s misconduct,—as it appeared to him,—in a certain particular case. And unfortunately,—though Harry was prepared to deny that his conduct on that occasion had been subject to censure,—he could not contradict any of the facts on which Mr. Prosper had founded his opinion. The story was told in reference to Mountjoy Scarborough, but not the whole story. \"I understand that there was a row in the streets late at night, at the end of which young Mr. Scarborough was left as dead under the railings.\" \"Left for dead!\" exclaimed Harry. \"Who says that he was left for dead? I did not think him to be dead.\" \"You had better read it to the end,\" said his father, and Harry read it. The letter went on to describe how Mountjoy Scarborough was missed from his usual haunts, how search was made by the police, how the newspapers were filled with the strange incident, and how Harry had told nothing of what had occurred. \"But beyond this,\" the letter went on to say, \"he positively denied, in conversation with the gentleman\u0027s brother, that he had anything to do with the gentleman on the night in question. If this be so, he absolutely lied. A man who would lie on such an occasion, knowing himself to have been guilty of having beaten the man in such a way as to have probably caused his death,—for he had left him for dead under the railings in a London street and in the midnight hour,—and would positively assert to the gentleman\u0027s brother that he had not seen the gentleman on the night in question, when he had every reason to believe that he had killed him,—a deed which might or might not be murder,—is not fit to be recognized as my heir.\" There were other sentences equally long and equally complicated, in all of which Mr. Prosper strove to tell the story with tragic effect, but all of which had reference to the same transaction. He said nothing as to the ultimate destination of the property, nor of his own proposed marriage. Should he have a son, that son would, of course, have the property. Should there be no son, Harry must have it, even though his conduct might have been ever so abominable. To prevent this outrage on society, his marriage,—with its ordinary results,—would be the only step. Of that he need say nothing. But the two hundred and fifty pounds would not be paid after the Christmas quarter, and he must decline for the future the honor of receiving Mr. Henry Annesley at the Hall. Harry, when he had read it all, began to storm with anger. The man, as he truly observed, had grossly insulted him. Mr. Prosper had called him a liar and had hinted that he was a murderer. \"You can do nothing to him,\" his father said. \"He is your uncle, and you have eaten his bread.\" \"I can\u0027t call him out and fight him.\" \"You must let it alone.\" \"I can make my way into the house and see him.\" \"I don\u0027t think you can do that. You will find it difficult to get beyond the front-door, and I would advise you to abandon all such ideas. What can you say to him?\" \"It is false!\" \"What is false? Though in essence it is false, in words it is true. You did deny that you had seen him.\" \"I forget what passed. Augustus Scarborough endeavored to pump me about his brother, and I did not choose to be pumped. As far as I can ascertain now, it is he that is the liar. He saw his brother after the affair with me.\" \"Has he denied it?\" \"Practically he denies it by asking me the question. He asked me with the ostensible object of finding out what had become of his brother when he himself knew what had become of him.\" \"But you can\u0027t prove it. He positively says that you did deny having seen him on the night in question, I am not speaking of Augustus Scarborough, but of your uncle. What he says is true, and you had better leave him alone. Take other steps for driving the real truth into his brain.\" \"What steps can be taken with such a fool?\" \"Write your own account of the transaction, so that he shall read it. Let your mother have it. I suppose he will see your mother.\" \"And so beg his favor.\" \"You need beg for nothing. Or if the marriage comes off—\" \"You have heard of the marriage, sir?\" \"Yes; I have heard of the marriage. I believe that he contemplates it. Put your statement of what did occur, and of your motives, into the hands of the lady\u0027s friends. He will be sure to read it.\" \"What good will that do?\" \"No good, but that of making him ashamed of himself. You have got to read the world a little more deeply than you have hitherto done. He thinks that he is quarrelling with you about the affair in London, but it is in truth because you have declined to hear him read the sermons after having taken his money.\" \"Then it is he that is the liar rather than I.\" \"I, who am a moderate man, would say that neither is a liar. You did not choose to be pumped, as you call it, and therefore spoke as you did. According to the world\u0027s ways that was fair enough. He, who is sore at the little respect you have paid him, takes any ground of offence rather than that. Being sore at heart, he believes anything. This young Scarborough in some way gets hold of him, and makes him accept this cock-and-bull story. If you had sat there punctual all those Sunday evenings, do you think he would have believed it then?\" \"And I have got to pay such a penalty as this?\" The rector could only shrug his shoulders. He was not disposed to scold his son. It was not the custom of the house that Harry should be scolded. He was a fellow of his college and the heir to Buston, and was therefore considered to be out of the way of scolding. But the rector felt that his son had made his bed and must now lie on it, and Harry was aware that this was his father\u0027s feeling. For two or three days he wandered about the country very down in the mouth. The natural state of ovation in which the girls existed was in itself an injury to him. How could he join them in their ovation, he who had suffered so much? It seemed to be heartless that they should smile and rejoice when he,—the head of the family, as he had been taught to consider himself,—was being so cruelly ill-used. For a day or two he hated Thoroughbung, though Thoroughbung was all that was kind to him. He congratulated him with cold congratulations, and afterward kept out of his way. \"Remember, Harry, that up to Christmas you can always have one of the nags. There\u0027s Belladonna and Orange Peel. I think you\u0027d find the mare a little the faster, though perhaps the horse is the bigger jumper.\" \"Oh, thank you!\" said Harry, and passed on. Now, Thoroughbung was fond of his horses, and liked to have them talked about, and he knew that Harry Annesley was treating him badly. But he was a good-humored fellow, and he bore it without complaint. He did not even say a cross word to Molly. Molly, however, was not so patient. \"You might be a little more gracious when he\u0027s doing the best he can for you. It is not every one who will lend you a horse to hunt for two months.\" Harry shook his head, and wandered away miserable through the fields, and would not in these days even set his foot upon the soil of the park. \"He was not going to intrude any farther,\" he said to the rector. \"You can come to church, at any rate,\" his father said, \"for he certainly will not be there while you are at the parsonage.\" Oh yes, Harry would go to the church. \"I have yet to understand that Mr. Prosper is owner of the church, and the path there from the rectory is, at any rate, open to the public;\" for at Buston the church stands on one corner of the park. This went on for two or three days, during which nothing farther was said by the family as to Harry\u0027s woes. A letter was sent off to Mrs. Brown, telling her that the lodgings would not be required any longer, and anxious ideas began to crowd themselves on Harry\u0027s mind as to his future residence. He thought that he must go back to Cambridge and take his rooms at St. John\u0027s and look for college work. Two fatal years, years of idleness and gayety, had been passed, but still he thought that it might be possible. What else was there open for him? And then, as he roamed about the fields, his mind naturally ran away to the girl he loved. How would he dare again to look Florence in the face? It was not only the two hundred and fifty pounds per annum that was gone: that would have been a small income on which to marry. And he had never taken the girl\u0027s own money into account. He had rather chosen to look forward to the position as squire of Buston, and to take it for granted that it would not be very long before he was called upon to fill the position. He had said not a word to Florence about money, but it was thus that he had regarded the matter. Now the existing squire was going to marry, and the matter could not so be regarded any longer. He saw half a dozen little Prospers occupying half a dozen little cradles, and a whole suite of nurseries established at the Hall. The name of Prosper would be fixed at Buston, putting it altogether beyond his reach. In such circumstances would it not be reasonable that Florence should expect him to authorize her to break their engagement? What was he now but the penniless son of a poor clergyman, with nothing on which to depend but a miserable stipend, which must cease were he to marry? He knew that he ought to give her back her troth; and yet, as he thought of doing so, he was indignant with her. Was love to come to this? Was her regard for him to be counted as nothing? What right had he to expect that she should be different from any other girl? Then he was more miserable than ever, as he told himself that such would undoubtedly be her conduct. As he walked across the fields, heavy with the mud of a wet October day, there came down a storm of rain which wet him through. Who does not know the sort of sensation which falls upon a man when he feels that even the elements have turned against him,—how he buttons up his coat and bids the clouds open themselves upon his devoted bosom? \"Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage, blow, You cataracts and hurricanes!\" It is thus that a man is apt to address the soft rains of heaven when he is becoming wet through in such a frame of mind; and on the present occasion Harry likened himself to Leer. It was to him as though the steeples were to be drenched and the cocks drowned when he found himself wet through. In this condition he went back to the house, and so bitter to him were the misfortunes of the world that he would hardly condescend to speak while enduring them. But when he had entered the drawing-room his mother greeted him with a letter. It had come by the day mail, and his mother looked into his face piteously as she gave it to him. The letter was from Brussels, and she could guess from whom it had come. It might be a sweetly soft love-letter; but then it might be neither sweet nor soft, in the condition of things in which Harry was now placed. He took it and looked at it, but did not dare to open it on the spur of the moment. Without a word he went up to his room, and then tore it asunder. No doubt, he said to himself, it would allude to his miserable stipend and penniless condition. The letter ran as follows: \"DEAREST HARRY,—I think it right to write to you, though mamma does not approve of it. I have told her, however, that in the present circumstances I am bound to do so, and that I should implore you not to answer. Though I must write, there must be no correspondence between us. Rumors have been received here very detrimental to your character.\" Harry gnashed his teeth as he read this. \"Stories are told about your meeting with Captain Scarborough in London, which I know to be only in part true. Mamma says that because of them I ought to give up my engagement, and my uncle, Sir Magnus, has taken upon himself to advise me to do so. I have told them both that that which is said of you is in part untrue; but whether it be true or whether it be false, I will never give up my engagement unless you ask me to do so. They tell me that as regards your pecuniary prospects you are ruined. I say that you cannot be ruined as long as you have my income. It will not be much, but it will, I should think, be enough. \"And now you can do as you please. You may be quite sure that I shall be true to you, through ill report and good report. Nothing that mamma can say to me will change me, and certainly nothing from Sir Magnus. \"And now there need not be a word from you, if you mean to be true to me. Indeed, I have promised that there shall be no word, and I expect you to keep my promise for me. If you wish to be free of me, then you must write and say so. \"But you won\u0027t wish it, and therefore I am yours, always, always, always your own \"FLORENCE.\" Harry read the letter standing up in the middle of the room, and in half a minute he had torn off his wet coat and kicked one of his wet boots to the farther corner of the room. Then there was a knock at the door, and his mother entered, \"Tell me, Harry, what she says.\" He rushed up to his mother, all damp and half-shod as he was, and seized her in his arms. \"Oh, mother, mother!\" \"What is it, dear?\" \"Read that, and tell me whether there ever was a finer human being!\" Mrs. Annesley did read it, and thought that her own daughter Molly was just as fine a creature. Florence was simply doing what any girl of spirit would do. But she saw that her son was as jubilant now as he had been downcast, and she was quite willing to partake of his comfort. \"Not write a word to her! Ha, ha! I think I see myself at it!\" \"But she seems to be in earnest there.\" \"In earnest! And so am I in earnest. Would it be possible that a fellow should hold his hand and not write? Yes, my girl; I think that I must write a line. I wonder what she would say if I were not to write?\" \"I think she means that you should be silent.\" \"She has taken a very odd way of assuming it. I am to keep her promise for her,—my darling, my angel, my life! But I cannot do that one thing. Oh, mother, mother, if you knew how happy I am! What the mischief does it all signify,—Uncle Prosper, Miss Thoroughbung, and the rest of it,—with a girl like that?\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2755/75963.html","bookId":1347,"book":{"id":1347,"title":"Mr. Scarborough\u0027s Family","description":"简介： It will be necessary, for the purpose of my story, that I shall go back more than once from the point at which it begins, so that I may explain with the least amount of awkwardness the things as they occurred, which led up to the incidents that I am...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2755","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:54 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:54 AM"}}
