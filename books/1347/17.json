{"id":18335,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVII. MR. GREY DINES AT HOME.","content":"Mr. Grey returned home in a cab on the day of Mr. Tyrrwhit\u0027s visit, not in the happiest humor. Though he had got the best of Mr. Tyrrwhit in the conversation, still, the meeting, which had been protracted, had annoyed him. Mr. Tyrrwhit had made accusations against himself personally which he knew to be false, but which, having been covered up, and not expressed exactly, he had been unable to refute. A man shall tell you you are a thief and a scoundrel in such a manner as to make it impossible for you to take him by the throat. \"You, of course, are not a thief and a scoundrel,\" he shall say to you, but shall say it in such a tone of voice as to make you understand that he conceives you to be both. We all know the parliamentary mode of giving an opponent the lie so as to make it impossible that the Speaker shall interfere. Mr. Tyrrwhit had treated Mr. Grey in the same fashion; and as Mr. Grey was irritable, thin-skinned, and irascible, and as he would brood over things of which it was quite unnecessary that a lawyer should take any cognizance, he went back home an unhappy man. Indeed, the whole Scarborough affair had been from first to last a great trouble to him. The work which he was now performing could not, he imagined, be put into his bill. To that he was supremely indifferent; but his younger partner thought it a little hard that all the other work of the firm should be thrown on his shoulders during the period which naturally would have been his holidays, and he did make his feelings intelligible to Mr. Grey. Mr. Grey, who was essentially a just man, saw that his partner was right, and made offers, but he would not accede to the only proposition which his partner made. \"Let him go and look for a lawyer elsewhere,\" said his partner. They both of them knew that Mr. Scarborough had been thoroughly dishonest, but he had been an old client. His father before him had been a client of Mr. Grey\u0027s father. It was not in accordance with Mr. Grey\u0027s theory to treat the old man after this fashion. And he had taken intense interest in the matter. He had, first of all, been quite sure that Mountjoy Scarborough was the heir; and though Mountjoy Scarborough was not at all to his taste, he had been prepared to fight for him. He had now assured himself, after most laborious inquiry, that Augustus Scarborough was the heir; and although, in the course of the business, he had come to hate the cautious, money-loving Augustus twice worse than the gambling spendthrift Mountjoy, still, in the cause of honesty and truth and justice, he fought for Augustus against the world at large, and against the band of creditors, till the world at large and the band of creditors began to think that he was leagued with Augustus,—so as to be one of those who would make large sums of money out of the irregularity of the affair. This made him cross, and put him into a very bad humor as he went back to Fulham. One thing must be told of Mr. Grey which was very much to his discredit, and which, if generally known, would have caused his clients to think him to be unfit to be the recipient of their family secrets;—he told all the secrets to Dolly. He was a man who could not possibly be induced to leave his business behind him at his office. It made the chief subject of conversation when he was at home. He would even call Dolly into his bedroom late at night, bringing her out of bed for the occasion, to discuss with her some point of legal strategy,—of legal but still honest strategy,—which had just occurred to him. Maybe he had not quite seen his way as to the honesty, and wanted Dolly\u0027s opinion on the subject. Dolly would come in in her dressing-gown, and, sitting on his bed, would discuss the matter with him as advocate against the devil. Sometimes she would be convinced; more frequently she would hold her own. But the points which were discussed in that way, and the strength of argumentation which was used on either side, would have surprised the clients, and the partner, and the clerks, and the eloquent barrister who was occasionally employed to support this side or the other. The eloquent barrister, or it might be the client himself, startled sometimes at the amount of enthusiasm which Mr. Grey would throw into his argument, would little dream that the very words had come from the young lady in her dressing-gown. To tell the truth, Miss Grey thoroughly liked these discussions, whether held on the lawn, or in the dining-room arm-chairs, or during the silent hours of the night. They formed, indeed, the very salt of her life. She felt herself to be the Conscience of the firm. Her father was the Reason. And the partner, in her own phraseology, was the—Devil. For it must be understood that Dolly Grey had a spice of fun about her, of which her father had the full advantage. She would not have called her father\u0027s partner the \"Devil\" to any other ear but her father\u0027s. And that her father knew, understanding also the spirit in which the sobriquet had been applied. He did not think that his partner was worse than another man, nor did he think that his daughter so thought. The partner, whose name was Barry, was a man of average honesty, who would occasionally be surprised at the searching justness with which Mr. Grey would look into a matter after it had been already debated for a day or two in the office. But Mr. Barry, though he had the pleasure of Miss Grey\u0027s acquaintance, had no idea of the nature of the duties which she performed in the firm. \"I\u0027m nearly broken-hearted about this abominable business,\" said Mr. Grey, as he went upstairs to his dressing room. The normal hour for dinner was half-past six. He had arrived on this occasion at half-past seven, and had paid a shilling extra to the cabman to drive him quick. The man, having a lame horse, had come very slowly, fidgeting Mr. Grey into additional temporary discomfort. He had got his additional shilling, and Mr. Grey had only additional discomfort. \"I declare I think he is the wickedest old man the world ever produced.\" This he said as Dolly followed him upstairs; but Dolly, wiser than her father, would say nothing about the wicked old man in the servants\u0027 hearing. In five minutes Mr. Grey came down \"dressed,\"—by the use of which word was implied the fact that he had shaken his neckcloth, washed his hands and face, and put on his slippers. It was understood in the household that, though half-past six was the hour named for dinner, half-past seven was a much more probable time. Mr. Grey pertinaciously refused to have it changed. \"Stare super vias antiquas,\" he had stoutly said when the proposition had been made to him; by which he had intended to imply that, as during the last twenty years he had been compelled to dine at half-past six instead of six, he did not mean to be driven any farther in the same direction. Consequently his cook was compelled to prepare his dinner in such a manner that it might be eaten at one hour or the other, as chance would have it. The dinner passed without much conversation other than incidental to Mr. Grey\u0027s wants and comforts. His daughter knew that he had been at the office for eight hours, and knew also that he was not a young man. Every kind of little cosseting was, therefore, applied to him. There was a pheasant for dinner, and it was essentially necessary, in Dolly\u0027s opinion, that he should have first the wing, quite hot, and then the leg, also hot, and that the bread-sauce should be quite hot on the two occasions. For herself, if she had had an old crow for dinner it would have been the same thing. Tea and bread-and-butter were her luxuries, and her tea and bread-and-butter had been enjoyed three hours ago. \"I declare I think that, after all, the leg is the better joint of the two.\" \"Then why don\u0027t you have the two legs?\" \"There would be a savor of greediness in that, though I know that the leg will go down,—and I shouldn\u0027t then be able to draw the comparison. I like to have them both, and I like always to be able to assert my opinion that the leg is the better joint. Now, how about the apple-pudding? You said I should have an apple-pudding.\" From which it appeared that Mr. Grey was not superior to having the dinner discussed in his presence at the breakfast-table. The apple-pudding came, and was apparently enjoyed. A large portion of it was put between two plates. \"That\u0027s for Mrs. Grimes,\" suggested Mr. Grey. \"I am not quite sure that Mrs. Grimes is worthy of it.\" \"If you knew what it was to be left without a shilling of your husband\u0027s wages you\u0027d think yourself worthy.\" When the conversation about the pudding was over Mr. Grey ate his cheese, and then sat quite still in his arm-chair over the fire while the things were being taken away. \"I declare I think he is the wickedest man the world has ever produced,\" said Mr. Grey as soon as the door was shut, thus showing by the repetition of the words he had before used that his mind had been intent on Mr. Scarborough rather than on the pheasant. \"Why don\u0027t you have done with them?\" \"That\u0027s all very well; but you wouldn\u0027t have done with them if you had known them all your life.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t spend my time and energies in white-washing any rascal,\" said Dolly, with vigor. \"You don\u0027t know what you\u0027d do. And a man isn\u0027t to be left in the lurch altogether because he\u0027s a rascal. Would you have a murderer hanged without some one to stand up for him?\" \"Yes, I would,\" said Dolly, thoughtlessly. \"And he mightn\u0027t have been a murderer after all; or not legally so, which as far as the law goes is the same thing.\" But this special question had been often discussed between them, and Mr. Grey and Dolly did not intend to be carried away by it on the present occasion. \"I know all about that,\" she said; \"but this isn\u0027t a case of life and death. The old man is only anxious to save his property, and throws upon you all the burden of doing it. He never agrees with you as to anything you say.\" \"As to legal points he does.\" \"But he keeps you always in hot water, and puts forward so much villany that I would have nothing farther to do with him. He has been so crafty that you hardly know now which is, in truth, the heir.\" \"Oh yes, I do,\" said the lawyer. \"I know very well, and am very sorry that it should be so. And I cannot but feel for the rascal because the dishonest effort was made on behalf of his own son.\" \"Why was it necessary?\" said Dolly, with sparks flying from her eye. \"Throughout from the beginning he has been bad. Why was the woman not his wife?\" \"Ah! why, indeed. But had his sin consisted only in that, I should not have dreamed of refusing my assistance as a family lawyer. All that would have gone for nothing then.\" \"When evil creeps in,\" said Dolly, sententiously, \"you cannot put it right afterward.\" \"Never mind about that. We shall never get to the end if you go back to Adam and Eve.\" \"People don\u0027t go back often enough.\" \"Bother!\" said Mr. Grey, finishing his second and last glass of port-wine. \"Do keep yourself in some degree to the question in dispute. In advising an attorney of to-day as to how he is to treat a client you can\u0027t do any good by going back to Adam and Eve. Augustus is the heir, and I am bound to protect the property for him from these money-lending harpies. The moment the breath is out of the old man\u0027s body they will settle down upon it if we leave them an inch of ground on which to stand. Every detail of his marriage must be made as clear as daylight; and that must be done in the teeth of former false statements.\" \"As far as I can see, the money-lending harpies are the honestest lot of people concerned.\" \"The law is not on their side. They have got no right. The estate, as a fact, will belong to Augustus the moment his father dies. Mr. Scarborough endeavored to do what he could for him whom he regarded as his eldest son. It was very wicked. He was adding a second and a worse crime to the first. He was flying in the face of the laws of his country. But he was successful; and he threw dust into my eyes, because he wanted to save the property for the boy. And he endeavored to make it up to his second son by saving for him a second property. He was not selfish; and I cannot but feel for him.\" \"But you say he is the wickedest man the world ever produced.\" \"Because he boasts of it all, and cannot be got in any way to repent. He gives me my instructions as though from first to last he had been a highly honorable man, and only laughs at me when I object. And yet he must know that he may die any day. He only wishes to have this matter set straight so that he may die. I could forgive him altogether if he would but once say that he was sorry for what he\u0027d done. But he has completely the air of the fine old head of a family who thinks he is to be put into marble the moment the breath is out of his body, and that he richly deserves the marble he is to be put into.\" \"That is a question between him and his God,\" said Dolly. \"He hasn\u0027t got a God. He believes only in his own reason,—and is content to do so, lying there on the very brink of eternity. He is quite content with himself, because he thinks that he has not been selfish. He cares nothing that he has robbed every one all round. He has no reverence for property and the laws which govern it. He was born only with the life-interest, and he has determined to treat it as though the fee-simple had belonged to him. It is his utter disregard for law, for what the law has decided, which makes me declare him to have been the wickedest man the world ever produced.\" \"It is his disregard for truth which makes you think so.\" \"He cares nothing for truth. He scorns it and laughs at it. And yet about the little things of the world he expects his word to be taken as certainly as that of any other gentleman.\" \"I would not take it.\" \"Yes, you would, and would be right too. If he would say he\u0027d pay me a hundred pounds to-morrow, or a thousand, I would have his word as soon as any other man\u0027s bond. And yet he has utterly got the better of me, and made me believe that a marriage took place, when there was no marriage. I think I\u0027ll have a cup of tea.\" \"You won\u0027t go to sleep, papa?\" \"Oh yes, I shall. When I\u0027ve been so troubled as that I must have a cup of tea.\" Mr. Grey was often troubled, and as a consequence Dolly was called up for consultations in the middle of the night. At about one o\u0027clock there came the well-known knock at Dolly\u0027s door and the usual invitation. Would she come into her father\u0027s room for a few minutes? Then her father trotted back to his bed, and Dolly, of course, followed him as soon as she had clothed herself decently. \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me?\" \"I thought I had made up my mind not to go; or I thought rather that I should be able to make up my mind not to go. But it is possible that down there I may have some effect for good.\" \"What does he want of you?\" \"There is a long question about raising money with which Augustus desires to buy the silence of the creditors.\" \"Could he get the money?\" asked Dolly. \"Yes, I think he could. The property at present is altogether unembarrassed. To give Mr. Scarborough his due, he has never put his name to a scrap of paper; nor has he had occasion to do so. The Tretton pottery people want more land, or rather more water, and a large sum of money will be forthcoming. But he doesn\u0027t see the necessity of giving Mr. Tyrrwhit a penny-piece, or certainly Mr. Hart. He would send them away howling without a scruple. Now, Augustus is anxious to settle with them, for some reason which I do not clearly understand. But he wishes to do so without any interference on his father\u0027s part. In fact, he and his father have very different ideas as to the property. The squire regards it as his, but Augustus thinks that any day may make it his own. In fact, they are on the very verge of quarrelling.\" Then, after a long debate, Dolly consented that her father should go down to Tretton, and act, if possible, the part of peace-maker.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2755/75956.html","bookId":1347,"book":{"id":1347,"title":"Mr. Scarborough\u0027s Family","description":"简介： It will be necessary, for the purpose of my story, that I shall go back more than once from the point at which it begins, so that I may explain with the least amount of awkwardness the things as they occurred, which led up to the incidents that I am...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2755","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:54 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:54 AM"}}
