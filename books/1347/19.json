{"id":18337,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XIX. MR. GREY GOES TO TRETTON.","content":"Mr. Grey went down to Tretton with a great bag of papers. In fact, though he told his daughter that he had to examine them all before he started, and had taken them to Fulham for that purpose, he had not looked at them. And, as another fact, the bag was not opened till he got home again. They had been read;—at any rate, what was necessary. He knew his subject. The old squire knew it well. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Grey was going down to Tretton, not to convey facts or to explain the law, but in order that he might take the side either of the father or of the son. Mr. Scarborough had sent for the lawyer to support his view of the case; and the son had consented to meet him in order that he might the more easily get the better of his father. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Grey had of late learned one thing which had before been dark to him,—had seen one phase of this complicated farrago of dishonesty which had not before been visible to him. Augustus suspected his father of some farther treachery. That he should be angry at having been debarred from his birthright so long,—debarred from the knowledge of his birthright,—was, Mr. Grey thought, natural. A great wrong had been, at least, intended; and that such a man should resent it was to have been expected. But of late Mr. Grey had discovered that it was not in that way that the son\u0027s mind worked. It was not anger but suspicion that he showed; and he used his father\u0027s former treatment of him as a justification for the condemnation implied in his thoughts. There is no knowing what an old man may do who has already acted as he had done. It was thus that he expressed himself both by his words and deeds, and did so openly in his father\u0027s presence, Mr. Grey had not seen them together, but knew from the letters of both of them that such was the case. Old Mr. Scarborough scorned his son\u0027s suspicions, and disregarded altogether any words that might be said as to his own past conduct. He was willing, or half willing, that Mountjoy\u0027s debts should be, not paid, but settled. But he was willing to do nothing toward such a step except in his own way. While the breath was in his body the property was his, and he chose to be treated as its only master. If Augustus desired to do anything by \"post-obits,\" let him ruin himself after his own fashion. \"It is not very likely that Augustus can raise money by post obits, circumstanced as the property is,\" he had written to Mr. Grey, with a conveyed sneer and chuckle as to the success of his own villany. It was as though he had declared that the money-lenders had been too well instructed as to what tricks Mr. Scarborough could play with his property to risk a second venture. \\n\\n \\n\\n Augustus had, in truth, been awaiting his father\u0027s death with great impatience. It was unreasonable that a man should live who had acted in such a way and who had been so cut about by the doctors. His father\u0027s demise had, in truth, been promised to him, and to all the world. It was an understood thing, in all circles which knew anything, that old Mr. Scarborough could not live another month. It had been understood some time, and was understood at the present moment; and yet Mr. Scarborough went on living,—no doubt, as an invalid in the last stage of probable dissolution, but still with the full command of his intellect and mental powers for mischief. Augustus, suspecting him as he did, had begun to fear that he might live too long. His brother had disappeared, and he was the heir. If his father would die,—such had been his first thought,—he could settle with the creditors immediately, before any tidings should be heard of his brother. But tidings had come. His brother had been seen by Mr. Hart at Monte Carlo; and though Mr. Hart had not yet sent home the news to the other creditors, the news had been sent at once to Augustus Scarborough by his own paid attendant upon his brother. Of Mr. Hart\u0027s \"little game\" he did not yet know the particulars; but he was confident that there was some game. \\n\\n \\n\\n Augustus by no means gave his mother credit for the disgraceful conduct imputed to her in the story as now told by her surviving husband. It was not that he believed in the honesty of his mother, whom he had never known, and for whose memory he cared little, but that he believed so fully in the dishonesty of his father. His father, when he had thoroughly understood that Mountjoy had enveloped the property in debt, so that nothing but a skeleton would remain when the bonds were paid, had set to work, and by the ingenuity of his brain had resolved to redeem, as far as the Scarboroughs were concerned, their estate from its unfortunate position. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was so that Augustus believed; this was the theory existing in his mind. That his father should have been so clever, and Mr. Grey so blind, and even Mr. Hart and Mr. Tyrrwhit so easily hoodwinked, was remarkable. But so it was,—or might probably be so. He felt no assurance, but there was ever present to him the feeling of great danger. But the state of things as arranged by his father might be established by himself. If he could get these creditors to give up their bonds while his father\u0027s falsehood was still believed, it would be a great thing. He had learned by degrees how small a proportion of the money claimed had, in fact, been advanced to Mountjoy, and had resolved to confine himself to paying that. That might now probably be accepted with gratitude. The increasing value of the estate might bear that without being crushed. But it should be done at once, while Mountjoy was still absent and before Mr. Tyrrwhit at any rate knew that Mountjoy had not been killed. Then had happened that accidental meeting with Mr. Hart at Monte Carlo. That idiot of a keeper of his had been unable to keep Mountjoy from the gambling-house. But Mr. Hart had as yet told nothing. Mr. Hart was playing some game of his own, in which he would assuredly be foiled. The strong hold which Augustus had was in the great infirmity of his father and in the blindness of Mr. Grey, but it would be settled. It ought to have been well that the thing should be settled already by his father\u0027s death. Augustus did feel strongly that the squire ought to complete his work by dying. Were the story, as now told by him, true, he ought certainly to die, so as to make speedy atonement for his wickedness. Were it false, then he ought to go quickly, so that the lie might be effectual. Every day that he continued to live would go far to endanger the discovery. Augustus felt that he must at once have the property in his own hands, so as to buy the creditors and obtain security. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Grey, who was not so blind as Augustus thought him, saw a great deal of this. Augustus suspected him as well as the squire. His mind went backward and forward on these suspicions. It was more probable that the squire should have contrived all this with the attorney\u0027s assistance than without it. The two, willing it together, might be very powerful. But then Mr. Grey would hardly dare to do it. His father knew that he was dying; but Mr. Grey had no such easy mode of immediate escape if detected. And his father was endowed with a courage as peculiar as it was great. He did not think that Mr. Grey was so brave a man as his father. And then he could trace the payment of no large sum to Mr. Grey,—such as would have been necessary as a bribe in such a case. Augustus suspected Mr. Grey, on and off. But Mr. Grey was sure that Augustus suspected his own father. Now, of one thing Mr. Grey was certain:—Augustus was, in truth, the rightful heir. The squire had at first contrived to blind him,—him, Mr. Grey,—partly by his own acuteness, partly through the carelessness of himself and those in his office, partly by the subornation of witnesses who seemed to have been actually prepared for such an event. But there could be no subsequent blinding. Mr. Grey had a well-earned reputation for professional acuteness and honesty. He knew there was no need for such suspicions as those now entertained by the young man; but he knew also that they existed, and he hated the young man for entertaining them. \\n\\n \\n\\n When he arrived at Tretton Park he first of all saw Mr. Septimus Jones, with whom he was not acquainted. \"Mr. Scarborough will be here directly. He is out somewhere about the stables,\" said Mr. Jones, in that tone of voice with which a guest at the house,—a guest for pleasure,—may address sometimes a guest who is a guest on business. In such a case the guest on pleasure cannot be a gentleman, and must suppose that the guest on business is not one either. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Grey, thinking that the Mr. Scarborough spoken of could not be the squire, put Mr. Jones right. \"It is the elder Mr. Scarborough whom I wish to see. There is quite time enough. No doubt Miss Scarborough will be down presently.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are Mr. Grey, I believe?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That is my name.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My friend, Augustus Scarborough, is particularly anxious to see you before you go to his father. The old man is in very failing health, you know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am well acquainted with the state of Mr. Scarborough\u0027s health,\" said Mr. Grey, \"and will leave it to himself to say when I shall see him. Perhaps to-morrow will be best.\" Then he rung the bell; but the servant entered the room at the same moment and summoned him up to the squire\u0027s chamber. Mr. Scarborough also wished to see Mr. Grey before his son, and had been on the alert to watch for his coming. \\n\\n \\n\\n On the landing he met Miss Scarborough. \"He does seem to keep up his strength,\" said the lady. \"Mr. Merton is living in the house now, and watches him very closely.\" Mr. Merton was a resident young doctor, whom Sir William Brodrick had sent down to see that all medical appliances were at hand as the sick man might require them. Then Mr. Grey was shown in, and found the squire recumbent on a sofa, with a store of books within his reach, and reading apparatuses of all descriptions, and every appliance which the ingenuity of the skilful can prepare for the relief of the sick and wealthy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This is very kind of you, Mr. Grey,\" said the squire, speaking in a cheery voice. \"I wanted you to come very much, but I hardly thought that you would take the trouble. Augustus is here, you know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So I have heard from that gentleman down-stairs.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Jones? I have never had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Jones. What sort of a gentleman is Mr. Jones to look at?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very much like other gentlemen.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I dare say. He has done me the honor to stay a good deal at my house lately. Augustus never comes without him. He is \u0027Fidus Achates,\u0027 I take it, to Augustus. Augustus has never asked whether he can be received. Of course it does not matter. When a man is the eldest son, and, so to say, the only one, he is apt to take liberties with his father\u0027s house. I am so sorry that in my position I cannot do the honors and receive him properly. He is a very estimable and modest young man, I believe?\" As Mr. Grey had not come down to Tretton either to be a spy on Mr. Jones or to answer questions concerning him, he held his tongue. \"Well, Mr. Grey, what do you think about it;—eh?\" This was a comprehensive question, but Mr. Grey well understood its purport. What did he, Mr. Grey, think of the condition to which the affairs of Tretton had been brought, and those of Mr. Scarborough himself and of his two sons? What did he think of Mountjoy, who had disappeared and was still absent? What did he think of Augustus, who was not showing his gratitude in the best way for all that had been done for him? And what did he think of the squire himself, who from his death-bed had so well contrived to have his own way in everything,—to do all manner of illegal things without paying any of the penalties to which illegality is generally subject? And having asked the question he paused for an answer. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Grey had had no personal interview with the squire since the time at which it had been declared that Mountjoy was not the heir. Then some very severe words had been spoken. Mr. Grey had first sworn that he did not believe a word of what was said to him, and had refused to deal with the matter at all. If carried out Mr. Scarborough must take it to some other lawyer\u0027s office. There had, since that, been a correspondence as to much of which Mr. Scarborough had been forced to employ an amanuensis. Gradually Mr. Grey had assented, in the first instance on behalf of Mountjoy, and then on behalf of Augustus. But he had done so in the expectation that he should never again see the squire in this world. He, too, had been assured that the man would die, and had felt that it would be better that the management of things should then be in honest hands, such as his own, and in the hands of those who understood them, than be confided to those who did not not understand them, and who might probably not be honest. \\n\\n \\n\\n But the squire had not died, and here he was again at Tretton as the squire\u0027s guest. \"I think,\" said Mr. Grey, \"that the less said about a good deal of it the better.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That, of course, is sweeping condemnation, which, however, I expect. Let that be all as though it had been expressed. You don\u0027t understand the inner man which rules me,—how it has struggled to free itself from conventionalities. Nor do I quite understand how your inner man has succumbed to them and encouraged them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have encouraged an obedience to the laws of my country. Men generally find it safer to do so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Exactly, and men like to be safe. Perhaps a condition of danger has had its attractions for me. It is very stupid, but perhaps it is so. But let that go. The rope has been round my own neck and not round that of others. Perhaps I have thought of late that if danger should come I could run away from it all, by the help of the surgeon. They have become so skilful now that a man has no chance in that way. But what do you think of Mountjoy and Augustus?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think that Mountjoy has been very ill-used.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I endeavored to do the best I could for him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And that Augustus has been worse used.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But he, at any rate, has been put right quite in time. Had he been brought up as the eldest son he might have done as Mountjoy did.\" Then there came a little gleam of satisfaction across the squire\u0027s face as he felt the sufficiency of his answer. \"But they are neither of them pleased.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You cannot please men by going wrong, even in their own behalf.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m not so sure of that. Were you to say that we cannot please men ever by doing right on their behalf you would perhaps be nearer the mark. Where do you think that Mountjoy is?\" A rumor, had reached Mr. Grey that Mountjoy had been seen at Monte Carlo, but it had been only a rumor. The same had, in truth, reached Mr. Scarborough, but he chose to keep his rumor to himself. Indeed, more than a rumor had reached him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think that he will turn up safely,\" said the lawyer. \"I think that if it were made worth his while he would turn up at once.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is it not better that he should be away?\" Mr. Grey shrugged his shoulders. \"What\u0027s the good of his coming back into a nest of hornets? I have always thought that he did very well to disappear. Where is he to live if he came back? Should he come here?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not with his gambling debts unpaid at the club.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That might have been settled. Though, indeed, his gambling was as a tub that has no bottom to it. There has been nothing for it but to throw him over altogether. And yet how very much the better he has been of the two! Poor Mountjoy!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Poor Mountjoy!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You see, if I hadn\u0027t disinherited him I should have had to go on paying for him till the whole estate would have been squandered even during my lifetime.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You speak as though the law had given you the power of disinheriting him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So it did.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But not the power of giving him the inheritance.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I took that upon myself. There I was stronger than the law. Now I simply and humbly ask the law to come and help me. And the upshot is that Augustus takes upon himself to lecture me and to feel aggrieved. He is not angry with me for what I did about Mountjoy, but is quarrelling with me because I do not die. I have no idea of dying just to please him. I think it important that I should live just at present.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But will you let him have the money to pay these creditors?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That is what I want to speak about. If I can see the list of the sums to be paid, and if you can assure yourself that by paying them I shall get back all the post-obit bonds which Mountjoy has given, and that the money can be at once raised upon a joint mortgage, to be executed by me and Augustus, I will do it. But the first thing must be to know the amount. I will join Augustus in nothing without your consent. He wants to assume the power himself. In fact, the one thing he desires is that I shall go. As long as I remain he shall do nothing except by my co-operation. I will see you and him to-morrow, and now you may go and eat your dinner. I cannot tell you how much obliged I am to you for coming.\" And then Mr. Grey left the room, went to his chamber, and in process of time made his way into the drawing-room. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2755/75958.html","bookId":1347,"book":{"id":1347,"title":"Mr. Scarborough\u0027s Family","description":"简介： It will be necessary, for the purpose of my story, that I shall go back more than once from the point at which it begins, so that I may explain with the least amount of awkwardness the things as they occurred, which led up to the incidents that I am...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2755","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:54 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:54 AM"}}
