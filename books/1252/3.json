{"id":14247,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III.—AU REVOIR.","content":"It was not a very good beginning, and the first to feel that was John William himself. He felt it at tea. During the meal his mouth never opened, except on business; but his eyes made up for it. \n \n He saw everything. He saw that his mother and Missy would never get on; he knew it the moment they kissed. There was no sounding smack that time. The visitor, for her part, seemed anxious to show that even she could be shy if she tried; and as for Mrs. Teesdale and her warm greeting, it was very badly done. The tone was peevish, and her son, for one, could hear between the words. \"You\u0027re our old friends\u0027 child,\" he heard her saying in her heart, \"but I don\u0027t think I shall like you; for you\u0027ve come without letting me know, you\u0027ve smoked, and you\u0027ve set my own son against me—already.\" He was half sorry that he had checked, what is as necessary to some as the breath they draw, a little plain speaking at the outset. But sooner or later, about one thing or another, this was bound to come; and come it did. \n \n \"I can\u0027t think, Miriam,\" said Mrs. Teesdale, \"how you came by that red hair o\u0027 yours! Your father\u0027s was very near black, and your mother\u0027s a light brown wi\u0027 a streak o\u0027 gold in it; but there wasn\u0027t a red hair in either o\u0027 their heads that I can remember.\" \n \n At this speech John William bit off an oath under his beard, while David looked miserably at his wife, and Arabella at their visitor, who first turned as red as her hair, and then burst into a fit of her merriest laughter. \n \n \"Well, I can\u0027t help it, can I?\" cried she, with a good-nature that won two hearts, at any rate. \"I didn\u0027t choose my hair; it grew its own colour—all I\u0027ve got to do is to keep it on!\" \n \n \"Yes, but it\u0027s that red!\" exclaimed Mrs. Teesdale stolidly, while John William chuckled and looked less savage. \n \n \"Ah, you could light your old pipe at it,\" said Missy to the farmer, making the chuckler laugh outright. \n \n Not so Mr. Teesdale. \"My dear,\" he said to his wife; \"my dear!\" \n \n \"Well, but I could understand it, David, if her parents\u0027 hairs had any red in \u0027em. In the only photograph we have of you, Miriam, which is that group there taken when you were all little, you look to have your mother\u0027s fair hair. I can\u0027t make it out.\" \n \n \"No?\" said Missy, sweetly. \"Then you didn\u0027t know that red always comes out light in a photograph?\" \n \n \"Oh, I know nothing at all about that,\" said Mrs. Teesdale, with the proper disregard for a lost point. \"Then have the others all got red hair too?\" \n \n \"N—no, I\u0027m the only one.\" \n \n \"Well, that\u0027s a good thing, Miriam, I\u0027m sure it is!\" \n \n \"Nay, come, my dear, that\u0027ll do,\" whispered David; while John William said loudly, to change the subject, \"You\u0027re not to call her Miriam, mother.\" \n \n \"And why not, I wonder?\" \n \n \"Because she\u0027s not used to it. She says they call her Missy at home; and we want to make her at home here, surely to goodness!\" \n \n Missy had smiled gratefully on John William and nodded confirmation of his statement to Mrs. Teesdale, who, however, shook her head. \n \n \"Ay, but I don\u0027t care for nicknames at all,\" said she, without the shadow of a smile; \"I never did and I never shall, John William. So, Miriam, you\u0027ll have to put up with your proper name from me, for I\u0027m too old to change. And I\u0027m sure it\u0027s not an ugly one,\" added the dour woman, less harshly. \"Is your cup off, Miriam?\" she added to that; she did not mean to be quite as she was. \n \n It was at this point, however, that the visitor asked Mr. Teesdale the time, and that Mr. Teesdale, with a sudden eloquence in his kind old eyes, showed her the watch which Mr. Oliver had given him; speaking most touchingly of her father\u0027s goodness, and kindness, and generosity, and of their lifelong friendship. Thus the long hand marked some minutes while the watch was still out before it appeared why Missy wanted to know the time. She then declared she must get back to Melbourne before dark, a statement which provoked some brisk opposition, notably on the part of Mr. Teesdale. But the girl showed commendable firmness. She would go back as she had come, by the six o\u0027clock \u0027bus from the township. None of them, however, would hear of the \u0027bus, and John William waited until a compromise had been effected by her giving way on this point; then he went out to put-to. \n \n This proved a business. The old mare had already made one journey into Melbourne and back; and that was some nine miles each way. There was another buggy-horse, but it had to be run up from the paddock. Thus twenty minutes elapsed before John William led horse and trap round to the front of the house. He found the party he had left mildly arguing round the tea-table, now assembled on the grass below the red-brick verandah. They were arguing still, it seemed, and not quite so mildly. Missy was buttoning a yellow glove, the worse for wear, and she was standing like a rock, with her mouth shut tight. Mr. Teesdale had on his tall hat and his dust-coat, and the whip was once more in his hand; at the sight of him his son\u0027s heel went an inch into the ground. \n \n \"Only fancy!\" cried the old man in explanation. \"She says she\u0027s not coming back to us any more. She doesn\u0027t want to come out and stay with us!\" \n \n Arabella echoed the \"Only fancy!\" while Mrs. Teesdale thought of the old folks who had been young when she was, and said decisively, \"But she\u0027ll have to.\" \n \n John William said nothing at all; but it was to him the visitor now looked appealingly. \n \n \"It isn\u0027t that I shouldn\u0027t like it—that isn\u0027t it at all—it\u0027s that you wouldn\u0027t like me! Oh, you don\u0027t know what I am. You don\u0027t, I tell you straight. I\u0027m not fit to come and stay here—I should put you all about so—there\u0027s no saying what I shouldn\u0027t do. You can\u0027t think how glad I am to have seen you all. It\u0027s a jolly old place, and I shall be able to tell \u0027em all at home just what it\u0027s like. But you\u0027d far better let me rest where I am—you—you—you really had.\" \n \n She had given way, not to tears, indeed, but to the slightly hysterical laughter which had characterised her entry into the parlour when John William was looking through the crack. Now she once more made her laughter loud, and it seemed particularly inconsequent. Yet here was a sign of irresolution which old David, as the wisest of the Teesdales, was the first to recognise. Moreover, her eyes were flying from the weather-board farmhouse to the river timber down the hill, from the soft cool grass to the peaceful sky, and from hay-stack to hen-yard, as though the whole simple scene were a temptation to her; and David saw this also. \n \n \"Nonsense,\" said he firmly; and to the others, \"She\u0027ll come back and stay with us till she\u0027s tired of us—we\u0027ll never be tired of you, Missy. Ay, of course she will. You leave her to me, Mrs. T.\" \n \n \"Then,\" said Missy, snatching her eyes from their last fascination, a wattle-bush in bloom, \"will you take all the blame if I turn out a bad egg?\" \n \n \"A what?\" said Mrs. Teesdale. \n \n \"Of course we will,\" cried her husband, turning a deaf ear to John William, who was trying to speak to him. \n \n \"You promise, all of you!\" \n \n \"Of course we do,\" answered the farmer again; but he had not answered John William. \n \n \"Then I\u0027ll come, and your blood be on your own heads.\" \n \n For a moment she stood smiling at them all in turn; and not a soul of them saw her next going without thinking of this one. The low sun struck full upon the heavy red fringe, and on the pale face and the devil-may-care smile which it over-hung just then. At the back of that smile there was a something which seemed to be coming up swiftly like a squall at sea; but only for one moment; the next, she had kissed the women, shaken hands with the young man, mounted into the buggy beside Mr. Teesdale, and the two of them were driving slowly down the slope. \n \n \"I think, John William,\" said his mother, \"that you might have driven in this time, instead o\u0027 letting your father go twice.\" \n \n \"Didn\u0027t I want to?\" replied John William, in a bellow which made Missy turn her head at thirty yards. \"He was bent on going. He\u0027s the most pig-headed old man in the Colony. He wouldn\u0027t even answer me when I spoke to him about it just now.\" \n \n He turned on his heel, and mother and daughter were at last alone, and free to criticise. \n \n \"For a young lady fresh from England,\" began the former, \"I must say I thought it was a shabby dress—didn\u0027t you?\" \n \n \"Shabby isn\u0027t the word,\" said Arabella; \"if you ask me, I call her whole style flashy—as flashy as it can stick.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1600/47518.html","bookId":1252,"book":{"id":1252,"title":"The Unbidden Guest","description":"简介： Arabella was the first at the farm to become aware of Mr. Teesdale\u0027s return from Melbourne.
