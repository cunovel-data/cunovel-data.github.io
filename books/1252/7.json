{"id":14251,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VII.—MOONLIGHT SPORT.","content":"So the first few days were largely spent in teaching Missy to shoot. A very plucky pupil she made, too, if not a particularly apt one; but head and chief of her sporting qualities was her enthusiasm. That was intense. The girl was never happy without a gun in her hand. So far as safety went, she took palpable pains to follow every injunction in the matter of full-cock and half-cock, and laid to heart all the rules given her for the carrying and handling of a loaded firearm. Thus, no one feared her prowling about the farm on tiptoe with John William\u0027s double-barrels pointing admirably to earth; least of all, the sparrows and parrots which she never hit. Old Teesdale would go with her and stand chuckling at her side when she missed a sparrow sitting; once he snatched the smoking gun from her, and with the other barrel picked off the same small bird on the wing. Then there was much practice at folded newspapers, of which Missy could sometimes make a sieve, at her own range; and altogether these two shots enjoyed themselves. Certainly it was a sight to see them together—the weak-kneed old man, who could shoot so cleverly still, when he had a mind, and the jaunty young woman who was all slang and fun and rollicking good-nature, plus a cockney lust for blood and feathers. \\n\\n \\n\\n Missy\u0027s first feathers, however, were not such as she might stick in her hat, and her first blood was exceedingly ill-shed. To be sure, she knew no better until the deed was done, and the quaint dead bird with the big head and beak carried home in triumph to Mr. Teesdale. That triumph was short-lived. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Got one at last!\" cried Missy, as she dropped her prey at the old man\u0027s feet. Mr. Teesdale was smoking in the verandah, and he pulled a long face behind his smile. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So I see,\" said he; \"but do you know what it is you have got, Missy?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, I don\u0027t, but I mean to have him stuffed, whatever he is.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think I wouldn\u0027t, Missy, if I were you. It\u0027s a laughing jackass.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes? Well, I guess he won\u0027t laugh much more!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And there\u0027s a five-pound penalty for shooting him, Missy. He kills the snakes, therefore you are not allowed by law to kill him. You have broken the law, my dear, and the best thing that we can do is to bury the victim and say nothing about it to anybody.\" He was laughing, but the girl stood looking at her handiwork with a very red face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I thought I was to shoot everything,\" she said. \"I thought that everything eat the fruit and things. I never knew I was so beastly cruel!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She put away the gun, and spent most of that summer\u0027s day in reading to Mr. Teesdale, for whom she had developed a very pretty affection. They read longest in the parlour, with the window shut, and the blind down, and a big fly buzzing between it and the glass. The old man fell sound asleep in the end, whereupon Missy sat very still indeed, just to watch him. And what it was exactly in the worn and white-haired face that fetched the tears to her eyes and the shame to her cheeks, on this particular occasion, there is no saying; but Missy was scarcely Missy during the remainder of the afternoon. \\n\\n \\n\\n That evening, however, had already been pitched upon for some \u0027possum-shooting, given a good moon. From the moment she was reminded of this, at tea-time, the visitor was herself again, and something more. It is saying a good deal, but they had not hitherto seen her in such excessively high spirits as overcame her now. She lent Mr. Tees-dale a hand to load some cartridges in the gunroom while the others were milking; but she was rather a hindrance than a help to that patient old man. She would put in the shot before the powder. Then she got into pure infantile mischief, letting off caps under David\u0027s coat-tails, and doing her best to make him sharp with her. Herein she failed; nevertheless, the elder was glad enough to hand her over to the younger Teesdale when the time came, and with it a moon without a cloud. Neither Arabella nor her father was going, but three of the men were who worked on the place, and with whom John William was obliged to leave Missy alone in the yard while he went for the dogs. It was only for a minute or two; but the men were in fits of laughter when he returned. It appeared that Missy had been giving them some sort of a dance under that limelit moon. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Down, Major! Down, Laddie!\" John William cried at the dogs as they leaped up at Missy. \\n\\n \\n\\n But Missy answered, \"Down yourself, Jack—I like \u0027em.\" And the three men laughed; in fact, they seemed prepared to laugh at Missy whenever she opened her mouth; but John William laughed too as he led the way into the moonlit paddocks. \\n\\n \\n\\n Here the hunting-ground began without preliminary, for on this side of the farm there were trees and to spare, the land dipping in a gully full of timber before it rose to the high ploughed levels known as the Cultivation. The gully was well grassed for all its trees, which were divers as well as manifold. There were gum-trees blue and red, and stringy-barks, and she-oaks, each and all of them a haunt of the opossum and the native cat. The party promptly surrounded a blue gum at the base of which the dogs stood barking, and Missy found herself doing what the others did—getting the moon behind the branches and searching for what she was told would look more like the stump of a bough or a tangle of leaves than any known animal. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I believe it\u0027s a lie,\" said John William; \"for Laddie barked first, and Laddie always did tell lies.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tell lies?\" echoed Missy, with a puzzled grin. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, barking up trees where there\u0027s nothing at all—that\u0027s what we call telling lies; and old Laddie\u0027s started the evening well by telling one already.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not he,\" cried a shrill voice; and the youngest of the three farm-hands—a little bit of a fellow—stood pointing to a branch so low that everyone else had overlooked it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I see a little bit of a knot on the bough,\" said Missy, \"but blow me tight if I see anything else!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s it,\" cried John William. \"That little knot is a native cat.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Missy lowered her gun at once. \"Oh, I didn\u0027t come out,\" said she, \"to shoot cats!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But they aren\u0027t cats at all,\" Teesdale explained (while his men stood and laughed); \"they\u0027re much more like little leopards, I assure you. We only call them cats because—because I\u0027m bothered if I know why! It\u0027s not the name for them, as you\u0027ll say when you\u0027ve shot this beggar. And you don\u0027t know the way they tear our fowls to pieces, Missy, or you wouldn\u0027t make so many bones about it; besides which, you won\u0027t get an easier shot all night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, if that\u0027s the kind of customer, I\u0027m on to try,\" said Missy. She raised her gun there and then, pressed it to her shoulder, and took aim at the black notch against the silver disc of the moon. The moonlight licked the barrels from sight to sight, getting into Missy\u0027s eyes, but there were barely a dozen feet between muzzle and mark. The report was quickly followed by a lifeless thud upon the ground; and when the smoke cleared, that notch was gone from the bough. Then one of the men struck a match to show Missy what she had done; and she had done it so effectually as to give herself a sensation which she concealed with difficulty. It was not pity; there was no pitying a spotted little horror with so sharp a snout and such devilish fangs: but whatever it was, that sensation kept Missy modest in her success, so that she refused the next shot point-blank. John William took it, with the only possible result. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A bushy.\" someone said, turning over the dead bush-tailed opossum with his foot It looked very big and soft and gray, lying dead in the moonlight. Missy found it in her heart to pity an opossum. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you skin them?\" she asked at a respectful range. \"Do you make no use of them after all?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s so hard not to spoil them,\" John William said as he slipped another cartridge into the breech. He would have shown her how this particular skin had been ruined by the shot, but Missy said she quite understood. \\n\\n \\n\\n He was beginning to think her squeamish. He asked her whether she had not had enough. She would not admit it, and took another shot to prove her spirit. This time she failed, and bore her failure with an equanimity which (in Missy) amounted almost to apathy. That she was neither squeamish nor apathetic, however, was demonstrated very suddenly while the night was still young. \\n\\n \\n\\n A ring-tailed opossum had been brought to earth by a charge from the muzzle-loader of that stunted young colonial whose eyes were as sharp as his voice—he who had \"mooned\" the native cat. The others called him Geordie. The three of them were kneeling over the dead \"ringy,\" and Missy was taking no more notice of them than she could help; only Geordie\u0027s was a voice that made itself heard. Missy had taken little stock of what the kneeling men were doing or saying until suddenly she heard: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Young\u0027uns it is! I told you there was young \u0027uns! That little beggar\u0027s as dead as his mother, but this one ain\u0027t. \u0027Ere, come off \u0027er back, can\u0027t yer? She ain\u0027t no more good to you now, do you \u0027ear?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This was Geordie\u0027s manner of speech to the bunch of breathing fur that stuck tight to the dead doe\u0027s back, whence his fingers were busy disengaging it; but Geordie suddenly found himself on his back in the grass, and when he picked himself up it was Miss Oliver herself who was kneeling where he had knelt, and even going on with his work. It took her some moments, and when done her hands were bloody in the moonshine. Then, first she took that bit of warm fur and nursed it in her neck, stroking it with her chin. And next she turned a calm face up to her companions, and said distinctly to them all, \"I call this a damned shame, so I tell you straight!\" Indeed she was anything but squeamish. \\n\\n \\n\\n She lowered her eyes immediately, undid three buttons, and slipped the small opossum into her bosom. There she fixed it, with great care, but not the smallest fuss; and looking up once more, saw the three hirelings walking off together through the trees. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I tell you,\" she called after them—shaking her fist at their backs—\"I tell you it\u0027s the damnedest shame that ever was!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The words rang clear through the clear night, then found an answer at Missy\u0027s side. \"You are quite right. It is. And now won\u0027t you get up and come back home, Missy?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Jack!\" cried the girl faintly, as she stumbled to her feet. \"I\u0027d quite forgotten you were there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have been here all the time,\" said John William. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then do tell me what I\u0027ve been saying,\" said Missy, anxiously, as she took his arm and they started homeward. \"I couldn\u0027t see no more and keep my scalp fixed. I hope to God I haven\u0027t been swearing, have I?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not you, Missy. You\u0027ve only said what was right and proper. It was cruel, and I blame myself for the whole thing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, no, no! I wanted some sport. I thought I could kill things, and never give a—no, never give a thought to \u0027em. Now I know I can\u0027t. That\u0027s all. I say, though, if I did use a swear-word, you won\u0027t give me away, will you? I don\u0027t know what I said, and that\u0027s all about it; but when I lose my scalp—ah well, I know I can trust you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course you can,\" said John William cheerily. And involuntarily he pressed to his side the hand that was still within his arm. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t say swear-words unless I did lose my scalp—you understand?\" said Missy, coming back to it again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course you wouldn\u0027t; but you didn\u0027t.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m not so sure. I wouldn\u0027t have your parents hear of it if I did; they\u0027d take it so terribly to heart.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They shall hear nothing—not that there\u0027s anything for them to hear.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now my parents are different; they swear themselves.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come, I can\u0027t credit that, you know!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But they do—like troopers!\" persisted the girl. \"It\u0027s the fashion just now in England. You may not know—how should you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Missy,\" said John William, as he opened her the gate into the homestead yard, \"it\u0027s impossible to tell when you\u0027re joking and when you\u0027re not.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Aha, I mean it to be,\" cried the girl, bowing low to him, with the moon all over her. Then she stood up to her last inch, smiled full in his face, and turning, left him that smile to keep if he could. He would have followed her, but a burst of laughter in the men\u0027s room took him off his course, as good reasons occurred to him for calling in there first. \\n\\n \\n\\n The room was a part of one of the farm outhouses. In each corner was a bunk, and on each bunk a man (counting Geordie), the fourth being one Old Willie, a retired salt, who drove the milk into Melbourne in the middle of every night. Old Willie was sitting on the side of his bunk and chuckling so windily that the sparks were flying out of his cutty like fireworks. There was nothing, however, to show which of the other three was the entertainer, for each turned silent and looked guilty when John William entered and planted himself in their midst. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I just thought I\u0027d tell you,\" said he, with forced blandness, \"that there is to be no more \u0027possum-shooting on this place for good and all. The man who shoots another \u0027possum, I\u0027ll hide him with my own hands, and the man who catches me shooting one, he may take and shoot me. For it\u0027s a grand shame, men, it\u0027s a grand shame! You heard Miss Oliver say it was, didn\u0027t you?\" he added sharply, turning to the three. \\n\\n \\n\\n For the moment they looked blank; the next, it was such a fierce person who was repeating the question, with eyes so like pointed pistols, that one after the other of those three men meekly perjured their souls. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Exactly,\" said John William, nodding his head in a deadly calm. \"She said it was the grandest shame ever was; and if any man says she said anything else—well, he\u0027d better let me hear him, that\u0027s all!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1600/47522.html","bookId":1252,"book":{"id":1252,"title":"The Unbidden Guest","description":"简介： Arabella was the first at the farm to become aware of Mr. Teesdale\u0027s return from Melbourne.
