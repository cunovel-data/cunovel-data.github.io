She encouraged me to believe it was real—I think she half believed it herself. She practiced the old magic.\"\\n\\n \"What is that? Do you mean fortune-telling?\"\\n\\n Rohan shook his head and slid his hands into the pockets of his trousers. \"No,\" he said, looking amused, \"although she did tell fortunes to gadjos at times. The old magic is a belief that all of nature is connected and equal. Everything is alive. Even the trees have souls.\"\\n\\n Amelia was fascinated. It had always been impossible to coax Merripen to say anything about his past or his Romany beliefs, and here was a man who seemed willing to discuss anything. \"Do you believe in the old magic?\"\\n\\n \"No. But I like the idea of it.\" Rohan reached for her elbow to guide her around a rough patch of ground. Before she could object to the gentle touch, it was gone. \"The pooka isn\u0027t always wicked,\" he said. \"Sometimes it acts out of mischief. Playfulness.\"\\n\\n She gave him a skeptical glance. \"You call it playful for a creature to toss you on its back, fly up to the sky, and drop you into a ditch or bog?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s one of the stories,\" Rohan admitted with a grin. \"But in other accounts, the pooka only wants to take you on an adventure... fly you to places you can only see in dreams. And then he returns you home.\"\\n\\n \"But the legends say that after the horse takes you on his midnight travels, you\u0027re never the same.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" he said softly. \"How could you be?\"\\n\\n Without realizing it, Amelia had slowed their pace to a relaxed amble. It seemed impossible to walk with brisk efficiency on a day like this, with so much sun and soft air. And with this unusual man beside her, dark and dangerous and charming.\\n\\n \"Of all the places to see you again,\" she said, \"I would never have expected Lord Westcliff \u0027s estate. How did you come to be acquainted? He\u0027s a member of the gaming club, I suppose.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. And friends with the owner.\"\\n\\n \"Are Lord Westcliff\u0027s other guests accepting of your presence at Stony Cross Manor?\"\\n\\n \"You mean because I\u0027m a Roma?\" A sly smile touched his lips. \"I\u0027m afraid they have no choice but to be polite. First, out of respect for the earl. And then there\u0027s the fact that most of them are obliged to come to me for credit at the club—which means I have access to their private financial information.\"\\n\\n \"Not to mention private scandals,\" Amelia said, remembering the alley fight.\\n\\n His smile lingered. \"A few of those, too.\"\\n\\n \"Nevertheless, you must feel like an outsider at times.\\n\\n \"Always,\" he said in a matter-of-fact tone. \"I\u0027m an outsider to my people, as well. You see, I\u0027m a half-breed?poshram, they call it—born of a Gypsy mother and an Irish gadjo father. And since the family\u0027s lineage goes through the father, I\u0027m not even considered Roma. It\u0027s the worst violation of the code for one of our women to marry a gadjo.\"\\n\\n \"Is that why you don\u0027t live with your tribe?\"\\n\\n \"One of the reasons.\"\\n\\n Amelia wondered what it must be like for him, caught between two cultures, belonging to neither. No hope of ever being fully accepted. And yet there was no trace of self-pity in his tone.\\n\\n \"The Hathaways are outsiders, as well,\" she said. \"It\u0027s obvious we\u0027re not suited to a position in polite society. None of us have the education or breeding to carry it off. Supper at Stony Cross Manor should be a spectacle—I\u0027m sure it will end with us being tossed out on our ears.\"\\n\\n \"You may be surprised. Lord and Lady Westcliff don\u0027t usually stand on formality. And their table includes a great variety of guests.\"\\n\\n Amelia was not reassured. To her, upper society resembled the ornamental tanks used for exotic fish-keeping in fashionable parlors, filled with glittering creatures who darted and circled in patterns she had no hope of understanding. The Hathaways might as well attempt to live underwater as to belong in such elevated company. And yet they had no choice but to try.\\n\\n Spying a heavy growth of watercress on the bank of a wet meadow, Amelia went to examine it. Grasping a bunch, she pulled until the delicate stems snapped. \"Watercress is plentiful here, isn\u0027t it? I\u0027ve heard it can be made into a fine salad or sauce.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s also a medicinal herb. The Rom call it panishok. My grandmother used to put it in poultices for sprains or injuries. And it\u0027s a powerful love tonic. For women, especially.\"\\n\\n \"A what?\" The delicate greenery fell from her nerveless fingers.\\n\\n \"If a man wishes to reawaken his lover\u0027s interest, he feeds her watercress. It\u0027s a stimulant of the?\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t tell me! Don\u0027t!\"\\n\\n Rohan laughed, a mocking gleam in his eyes.\\n\\n Giving him a warning glance, Amelia brushed a few stray watercress leaves from her palms and continued on her way.\\n\\n Her companion followed readily. \"Tell me about your family,\" he coaxed. \"How many of you are there?\"\\n\\n \"Five in all. Leo—that is, Lord Ramsay—is the oldest, and I am the next, followed by Winnifred, Poppy, and Beatrix.\"\\n\\n \"Which sister is the frail one?\"\\n\\n \"Winnifred.\"\\n\\n \"Has she always been that way?\"\\n\\n \"No, Win was quite healthy until a year ago, when she nearly died from scarlet fever.\" A long hesitation, while her throat tightened a little. \"She survived, thank God, but her lungs are weak. She has little strength, and she tires easily. The doctor says Win may never improve, and in all likelihood she won\u0027t be able to marry or have children.\" Amelia\u0027s jaw hardened. \"We will prove him wrong, of course. Win will be completely well again.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine-till-midnight-the-hathaways-1/page-18.html","bookId":1788,"book":{"id":1788,"title":"Mine Till Midnight (The Hathaways #1)","description":"Storyline: When an unexpected inheritance elevates her family to the ranks of the aristocracy, Amelia Hathaway discovers that tending to her younger sisters and wayward brother was easy compared to navigating the intricacies of the ton.
