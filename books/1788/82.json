When Leo had finally gotten his bearings, he lurched toward the doorway, where the footman waited.\\n\\n \"May I escort you downstairs, my lord?\" George asked politely. Leo responded with a surly nod.\\n\\n \"Close the window,\" one of the women demanded, her na**d body shivering as the autumn wind swept through the room.\\n\\n Cam glanced at her dispassionately. He had seen too many of her kind to feel much pity. There were thousands of them in London—round-faced country wenches, just pretty enough to attract the attention of men who promised, took, and discarded without conscience. \"You should try some fresh air,\" he advised, reaching for a discarded lap blanket beside the settee. \"It promotes clear thinking.\"\\n\\n \"What do I need to do that for?\" she asked sourly.\\n\\n Cam grinned. \"Good point.\" He draped the blanket over her shivering white body. \"Still?you should take some deep breaths.\" He bent to pat her pale cheek gently. \"And leave this place as soon as you\u0027re able. Don\u0027t waste yourself on these bastards.\"\\n\\n The woman lifted her bloodshot eyes, staring in wonder at the black-haired man, who was as swarthy and dashing as a pirate prince with the glittering diamond at his ear.\\n\\n Her plaintive voice followed him as he left. \"Come back!\"\\n\\n It took the combined efforts of Cam and George to load the grumbling, protesting Leo into the carriage. \"It\u0027s like hauling five sacks of potatoes all at once,\" the footman said breathlessly, pushing Leo\u0027s foot safely inside the vehicle.\\n\\n \"The potatoes would be quieter,\" Cam said. He tossed the footman a gold sovereign.\\n\\n George caught it in midair and beamed at him. \"Thank you, sir! And may I say you\u0027re a gentleman, sir. Even if you are a Gypsy.\"\\n\\n Cam\u0027s smile turned wry, and he climbed into the carriage after Leo. They started back to Stony Cross Manor in silence.\\n\\n \"Do you need to stop?\" Cam asked midway through the trip, seeing that Leo\u0027s face had turned from white to green. Leo shook his head morosely. \"I don\u0027t wish to talk.\"\\n\\n \"You owe me an answer or two. Because if I hadn\u0027t had to spend the day searching through half of Hampshire to find you, I could have been in bed? With your sister, he thought, but instead said, \"Sleeping.\"\\n\\n Those curiously light eyes turned toward him, the color of icicles when blue twilight shone through them. Unusual eyes. Cam had seen someone with eyes like that before, but he couldn\u0027t remember who or when. A distant memory holered just beyond reach.\\n\\n \"What do you want to know?\" Leo asked.\\n\\n \"Why do you bear Merripen such ill will? Is it his charming disposition, or the fact that he\u0027s a Roma? Or is it because he was taken in by your parents and raised as one of you?\"\\n\\n \"None of that. I despise Merripen because he refused the only thing I ever asked of him.\"\\n\\n \"Which was?\"\\n\\n \"To let me die.\" Cam pondered that.\\n\\n \"You must mean when he nursed you through the scarlet fever.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"You blame him for saving your life?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"If it makes you feel any better,\" Cam said dryly, settling back in his seat, \"I\u0027m sure he\u0027s had second thoughts about it.\"\\n\\n They were silent after that, while Cam relaxed and let his mind wander. As darkness fell and Leo was cast in shadow, the unnerving eyes flickered silver-blue?—and Cam remembered.\\n\\n It was in childhood, when Cam had still been with the tribe. There had been a man with a haggard face and brilliant colorless eyes, his soul ravaged by grief over his daughter\u0027s death. Cam\u0027s grandmother had warned him to stay away from the man. \"He\u0027s muladi,\" she had said.\\n\\n \"What does that mean, Mami?\" Cam had asked, clinging anxiously to her warm hand, which was comfortingly gnarled and tough like the buttressing roots of ancient trees.\\n\\n \"Haunted by a dead person. Don\u0027t go near him, he\u0027s upset the balance of Romanija. He loved his daughter too much.\"\\n\\n Feeling pity for the man, and worry for his own sake, Cam had asked, \"Will I be muladi when you die, Mami?\" He had been certain that he loved his grandmother too much, but he couldn\u0027t stop feeling that way.\\n\\n A smile had appeared in his grandmother\u0027s wise black eyes. \"No, Cam. A muladi traps his beloved\u0027s spirit in the in-between because he won\u0027t let her go. You wouldn\u0027t do that to me, would you, little fox?\"\\n\\n \"No, Mami.\"\\n\\n The man had died not long after that, by his own hand. It had been a horror, and yet a relief for the entire tribe.\\n\\n Now, as Cam looked back on it with the understanding of an adult rather than a small boy, he felt a chill of apprehension, followed by searing pity. How impossible it would be to relinquish a woman you loved. How could you stop yourself from wanting her? The seams of your heart would rip open with grief. Of course you would want to keep her with you. Or follow her.\\n\\n As Cam entered the manor with the unrepentant prodigal at his side, Amelia and Beatrix hurried toward them, the former frowning, the latter smiling. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine-till-midnight-the-hathaways-1/page-82.html","bookId":1788,"book":{"id":1788,"title":"Mine Till Midnight (The Hathaways #1)","description":"Storyline: When an unexpected inheritance elevates her family to the ranks of the aristocracy, Amelia Hathaway discovers that tending to her younger sisters and wayward brother was easy compared to navigating the intricacies of the ton.
