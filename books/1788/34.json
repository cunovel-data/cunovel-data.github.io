She had found a lovely rug in one of the bedrooms, and after she had beaten it for an hour, it had turned out to be richly colored and in good condition.\n \"1 think most of the dust was transferred from the carpet to you,\" Amelia said. Since Poppy had covered the lower half of her face with a handkerchief during the carpet-beating, the dust had settled on her forehead, eyes, and the bridge of her nose. When the handkerchief was removed, it had left Poppy\u0027s face oddly two-toned, the top half gray, the lower half white.\n \"I enjoyed it immensely,\" Poppy replied with a grin. \"There\u0027s nothing like whacking a carpet with a rug-beater to vent one\u0027s frustrations.\"\n Amelia was about to ask what Poppy\u0027s frustrations were, when Beatrix entered the kitchen.\n The girl, usually so lively, was quiet and downcast.\n \"Tea will be ready soon,\" Poppy said, busy slicing bread at the kitchen table. \"Will you have some toast, too, Bea?\u0027\n \"No, thank you. Not hungry.\" Beatrix sat in a chair be side Amelia\u0027s, staring at the floor.\n \"You\u0027re always hungry,\" Amelia said. \"What\u0027s the matter, dear? Aren\u0027t you feeling well? Are you tired?\"\n Silence. A violent shake of her head. Beatrix was definitely upset about something.\n Amelia settled a gentle hand on her youngest sister\u0027s narrow back, and leaned over her. \"Beatrix, what is it? Tell me. Are you missing your friends? Or Spot? Are you?\n \"No, it\u0027s nothing like that.\" Beatrix ducked her head until only the reddened arc of her cheek was visible.\n \"Then what?\"\n \"Something\u0027s wrong with me.\" Her voice roughened with misery. \"It\u0027s happened again, Amelia. I couldn\u0027t help myself. I barely remember doing it. I?\n \"Oh, no,\" came Poppy\u0027s whisper.\n Amelia kept her hand on Beatrix\u0027s back. \"Is it the same problem as before?\"\n Beatrix nodded. \"I\u0027m going to kill myself,\" she said vehemently. \"I\u0027m going to lock myself in the bee room. I\u0027m going to?\n \"Hush. You\u0027ll do no such thing.\" Amelia rubbed her rigid back. \"Quiet, dear, and let me think for a moment.\" Her worried gaze met Poppy\u0027s over Beatrix\u0027s downbent head.\n \"The problem\" had occurred on and off for the past four years, ever since the Hathaways\u0027 mother had died. Every now and then Beatrix suffered an irresistible impulse to steal something, either from a shop or someone\u0027s home, usually the objects were insignificant... a tiny pair of sewing scissors, hairpins, a pen nib, a cube of sealing wax. But every so often she took something of value, like a snuff box or an earring. As far as Amelia could tell, Beatrix never planned these small crimes—in fact, the girl often wasn\u0027t even aware of what she had done until later. And then she suffered an agony of remorse, and no small amount of fear. It was alarming to discover one wasn\u0027t always in control of one\u0027s actions.\n The Hathaways kept Beatrix\u0027s problem a secret, of course, all of them conspiring to return the stolen objects discreetly and protect her from the consequences. Since it hadn\u0027t happened for nearly a year, they had all assumed Beatrix was cured of her inexplicable compulsion.\n \"I assume you took something from Stony Cross Manor,\" Amelia said with forced calm. \"That\u0027s the only place you\u0027ve visited.\"\n Beatrix nodded miserably. \"It was after I let Spot go. I went to the library, and looked in a few rooms on the way, and... I didn\u0027t mean to, Amelia! I didn\u0027t want to!\"\n \"I know.\" Amelia wrapped her arms around her in a consoling hug. She was filled with a maternal instinct to protect, soothe, ease. \"We\u0027ll fix it, Bea. We\u0027ll put everything back and no one will know. Just tell me what you took, and try to remember which rooms the things came from.\"\n \"Here?this is everything.\" Reaching into the pockets of her pinafore, Beatrix dumped a small collection of objects in her lap.\n Amelia held up the first item. It was a carved wooden horse, no bigger than her fist, with a silk mane and a delicately painted face. The object was worn from much handling, and there were teeth marks along the horse\u0027s body. \"The Westcliffs have a daughter, still quite small,\" she murmured. \"This must belong to her.\"\n \"I took a toy from a baby,\" Beatrix moaned. \"It\u0027s the lowest thing I\u0027ve ever done. I should be in prison.\"\n Amelia picked up another object, a card with two similar images printed side by side. She guessed it was meant to be inserted into a stereoscope, a device that would merge the two images into a dimensional picture.\n The next stolen item was a household key, and the last... oh, dear. It was a sterling silver seal, with an engraved family crest on one end. One would use it to stamp a blob of melted wax and close an envelope. The object was heavy and quite costly, the kind of thing that was passed down from generation to generation.\n \"From Lord Westcliffs private study,\" Beatrix muttered. \"It was on his desk. He probably uses it for his official correspondence. I\u0027ll go hang myself now.\"\n \"We must return this immediately,\" Amelia said, passing a hand over her dampening brow. \"When they realize it\u0027s missing, a servant may be blamed.\"\n The three women were silent with horror at the thought.\n \"We\u0027ll pay a morning call to Lady Westcliff,\" Poppy said, sounding a bit breathless from anxiety. \"Is tomorrow one of her receiving days?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine-till-midnight-the-hathaways-1/page-34.html","bookId":1788,"book":{"id":1788,"title":"Mine Till Midnight (The Hathaways #1)","description":"Storyline: \n When an unexpected inheritance elevates her family to the ranks of the aristocracy, Amelia Hathaway discovers that tending to her younger sisters and wayward brother was easy compared to navigating the intricacies of the ton.
