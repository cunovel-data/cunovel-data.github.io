{"id":78202,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"Her eyes widened at the sight of a small, stylized design inked on his arm. A tattoo of a black winged horse with eyes the color of brimstone. It was an Irish design, of a nightmare horse called a pooka: a malevolent mythical creature that spoke in a human voice and carried people away at midnight.\n Her heart stopped as she saw the heavy rounded band of a thumb ring.\n Wriggling beneath him, Amelia tried to turn over.\n The strong hand curved around her shoulder, helping her. His voice was low and familiar. \"Are you hurt? I\u0027m sorry. You were in the way of?\n He stopped as Amelia rolled to her back. The front of her hair had come loose, pulled free of a strategically anchored pin. The lock fanned over her face, obscuring her vision. Before she could reach up to push it away, he did it for her, and the brush of his fingertips sent ripples of liquid fire along intimate pathways of her body.\n \"You,\" he said softly.\n Cam Rohan.\n It can\u0027t be, she thought dazedly. Here, in Hampshire? But there were the unmistakable eyes, gold and hazel and heavy lashed, the midnight hair, the wicked mouth. And the pagan glitter of a diamond at his ear.\n His expression was perturbed, as if he\u0027d been reminded of something he had wanted to forget. But as his gaze slid over her bewildered face, his mouth curved a little, and he settled into the cradle of her body with an insolent familiarity that temporarily robbed her of breath.\n \"Mr. Rohan?how?why?what are you doing here?\"\n He replied without moving, as if he were planning to lie there and converse all day. His infinitely polite tone was an unsettling contrast to the intimacy of their position. \"Miss Hathaway. What a pleasant surprise. As it happens, I\u0027m visiting friends. And you?\"\n \"I live here.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think so. This is Lord Westcliff \u0027s estate.\"\n Her heart thundered in her breast as her body absorbed the details of him. \"I didn\u0027t mean precisely here, I meant over there, on the other side of the woods. The Ramsay estate. We\u0027ve just taken up residence.\" She couldn\u0027t seem to stop herself from chattering in the aftermath of nerves and fright. \"What was that noise? What were you doing? Why do you have that tattoo on your arm? It\u0027s a pooka—an Irish creature—isn\u0027t it?\"\n That last question earned her an arrested stare. Before Rohan could reply, the other two men approached. From her prone position, Amelia had an upside-down view of them. Like Rohan, they were in their shirtsleeves, with waistcoats left unbuttoned.\n One of them was a portly old gentleman with a shock of silver hair. He held a small wood-and-metal sextant, which had been strung around his neck on a lanyard. The other, black-haired man looked to be in his late thirties. He wasn\u0027t as tall as Rohan, but he had an air of authority tempered with aristocratic arrogance.\n Amelia made a helpless movement, and Rohan lifted away from her with fluid ease. He helped her stand, his arm steadying her. \"How far did it go?\" he asked the men.\n \"Devil take the rocket,\" came a gravelly reply. \"What is the woman\u0027s condition?\"\n \"Unharmed.\"\n The silver-haired gentleman remarked, \"Impressive, Rohan. You covered a distance of fifty yards in no more than five or six seconds.\"\n \"I would hardly miss a chance to leap on a beautiful woman,\" Rohan said, causing the older man to chuckle.\n Rohan\u0027s hand remained at the small of Amelia\u0027s back, the light pressure causing her blood to simmer.\n Easing away from his distracting touch, Amelia raised her hands to the dangling front locks of her hair, tucking them behind her ears. \"Why are you shooting rockets? And more to the point, why are you shooting them at my property?\"\n The stranger nearby gave her a sharp, assessing glance. \"Your property?\"\n Rohan interceded. \"Lord Westcliff, this is Miss Amelia Hathaway. Lord Ramsay\u0027s sister.\"\n Frowning, Westcliff executed a precise bow. \"Miss Hathaway. I was not informed about your arrival. Had I been aware of your presence, I would have notified you about our rocketry experiments, as I have everyone else in the vicinity.\"\n It was clear that Westcliff was a man who expected to be informed about everything. He looked annoyed that the new neighbors had dared to move into their own residence without telling him first.\n \"We arrived only yesterday, my lord,\" Amelia replied. \"I had intended to call on you after we settled in.\" Under ordinary circumstances, she would have left it at that. But she was still off balance, and there was no stopping the flow of comments from her own mouth. \"Well. I must say the guidebook didn\u0027t warn adequately about the occurrence of rocket fire amid the peaceful Hampshire scenery.\" She reached down and whacked at the dust and bits of leaf that clung to her skirts. \"I\u0027m sure you don\u0027t know the Hathaways well enough to shoot at us. Yet. When we become better acquainted, however, I have no doubt you\u0027ll find ample reason to bring out the artillery.\"\n Over her head, she heard Rohan laugh. \"Considering our issues with aim and accuracy, you have nothing to fear, Miss Hathaway.\"\n The silver-haired gentleman spoke then. \"Rohan, if you wouldn\u0027t mind finding out where that rocket landed?\n \"Of course.\" Rohan took off at an easy lope.\n \"Agile fellow,\" the older man said approvingly. \"Fast as a leopard. Not to mention steady of hands and nerves. What a sapper he\u0027d make.\"\n Introducing himself as Captain Swansea, formerly of the Royal Engineers, the elderly gentleman explained to Amelia that he was a rocketry enthusiast who was continuing his scientific work in a civil capacity. As a friend of Lord Westcliff, who shared his interest in engineering science, Swansea had come to experiment with a new rocket design in the country, where there was sufficient land to do so. Lord Westcliff had enlisted Cam Rohan to help with the flight equations and other mathematical calculations necessary to evaluate the performances of the rockets. \"Quite extraordinary, really, his facility with numbers,\" Swansea said. \"You\u0027d never expect it to look at him.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine-till-midnight-the-hathaways-1/page-16.html","bookId":1788,"book":{"id":1788,"title":"Mine Till Midnight (The Hathaways #1)","description":"Storyline: \n When an unexpected inheritance elevates her family to the ranks of the aristocracy, Amelia Hathaway discovers that tending to her younger sisters and wayward brother was easy compared to navigating the intricacies of the ton.
