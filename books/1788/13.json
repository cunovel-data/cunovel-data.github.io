She had been pursued and courted by Leo\u0027s best friend, a charming young architect named Christopher Frost, who, like Leo, had been articled to Rowland Temple. But on the day he had led her to believe a proposal was forthcoming, Frost had ended the relationship with brutal abruptness. He said he had developed feelings for another woman, who conveniently happened to be Rowland Temple\u0027s daughter.\n It was only to be expected of an architect, Leo had told her with grim remorse, outraged on behalf of his sister, sorrowful at the loss of a friend. Architects inhabited a world of masters and disciples and the endless pursuit of patrons. Everything, even love, was sacrificed on the altar of ambition. To be otherwise was to miss the few precious opportunities one might have to practice the art of design. Marrying Temple\u0027s daughter would give Christopher Frost a place at the table. Amelia could never have done that for him.\n All she had been able to do was love him.\n Swallowing back her bitterness, Amelia glanced up at her brother and managed a rueful smile. \"Thank you, but at this advanced stage of life, I have no ambitions to marry.\"\n Leo surprised her by bending to brush a light kiss on her forehead. His voice was soft and kind. \"Be that as it may, I think someday you\u0027ll meet a man worth giving up your independence for.\" He grinned before adding, \"Despite your encroaching old age.\"\n For a moment Amelia\u0027s mind chased back to the memory of the kiss in the shadows, the mouth slowly consuming hers, the gentle masculine hands, the whisper at her ear. Latcho drom...\n As her brother turned to walk away, she asked with mild exasperation, \"Where are you going? Leo, you can\u0027t leave when there\u0027s so much to be done.\"\n He stopped and glanced back at her with a raised brow. \"You\u0027ve been pouring unsweetened tea down my throat for days. If you have no objection, I\u0027d like to go out for a piss.\"\n She narrowed her eyes. \"I can think of at least a dozen polite euphemisms you could have used.\"\n Leo continued on his way. \"I don\u0027t use euphemisms.\"\n \"Or politeness,\" she said, making him chuckle.\n As Leo left the room, Amelia folded her arms and sighed. \"He\u0027s so much more pleasant when he\u0027s sober. A pity it doesn\u0027t happen more often. Come, Poppy, let\u0027s find the kitchen.\"\n With the house so stale and dust-riddled, the atmosphere was hard on poor Win\u0027s lungs, causing her to cough incessantly through the night. Having awakened countless times to administer water to her sister, to open the windows, to prop her up until the coughing spasms had eased, Amelia was bleary-eyed when morning came.\n \"It\u0027s like sleeping in a dust box,\" she told Merripen. \"She\u0027s better off sitting outside today, until we can manage to clean her room properly. The carpets must be beaten. And the windows are filthy.\"\n The rest of the family was still abed, but Merripen, like Amelia, was an early riser. Dressed in rough clothes and an open-necked shirt, he stood frowning as Amelia reported on Win\u0027s condition.\n \"She\u0027s exhausted from coughing all night, and her throat is so sore, she can barely speak. I\u0027ve tried to make her take some tea and toast, but she won\u0027t have it.\"\n \"I\u0027ll make her take it.\"\n Amelia looked at him blankly. She supposed she shouldn\u0027t be surprised by his assertion. After all, Merripen had helped nurse both Win and Leo through the scarlet fever. Without him, Amelia was certain neither of them would have survived.\n \"In the meanwhile,\" Merripen continued, \"make a list of supplies you want from the village. I\u0027ll go this morning.\"\n Amelia nodded, grateful for his solid, reliable presence. \"Shall I wake Leo? Perhaps he could help?\n \"No.\"\n She smiled wryly, well aware that her brother would be more of a hindrance than a help.\n Going downstairs, Amelia sought the help of Freddie, the boy from the village, to move an ancient chaise out to the back of the house. They set the furniture on a brick-paved terrace that opened onto a weed-choked garden bordered by beech hedges. The garden needed reseeding and replanting, and the crumbling low walls would have to be repaired.\n \"There\u0027s work to be done, mum,\" Freddie commented, bending to pluck a tall weed from between two paving bricks.\n \"Freddie, you are a master of understatement.\" Amelia contemplated the boy, who looked to be about thirteen. He was robust and ruddy-faced, with a ruff of hair that stood up like a robin\u0027s feathers. \"Do you like gardening?\" she asked. \"Do you know much about it?\"\n \"I keeps a kitchen plot for my ma.\"\n \"Would you like to be Lord Ramsay\u0027s gardener?\"\n \"How much does it pay, miss?\"\n \"Would two shillings a week suffice?\"\n Freddie looked at her thoughtfully and scratched his wind-chapped nose. \"Sounds good. But you\u0027ll have to ask my ma.\"\n \u0027Tell me where you live, and I\u0027ll visit her this very morning.\"\n \"All right. It\u0027s not far—we\u0027re at the closest side of the village.\"\n They shook hands on the deal, talked a moment more, and Freddie went to investigate the gardener\u0027s shed.\n Turning at the sound of voices, Amelia saw Merripen carrying her sister outside. Win was dressed in a nightgown and robe and swathed in a shawl, her slim arms looped around Merripen\u0027s neck. With her white garments and blond hair and fair skin, Win was nearly colorless except for the flags of soft pink across her cheekbones and the vivid blue of her eyes. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine-till-midnight-the-hathaways-1/page-13.html","bookId":1788,"book":{"id":1788,"title":"Mine Till Midnight (The Hathaways #1)","description":"Storyline: \n When an unexpected inheritance elevates her family to the ranks of the aristocracy, Amelia Hathaway discovers that tending to her younger sisters and wayward brother was easy compared to navigating the intricacies of the ton.
