I hate to leave with things so unsettled, and Mr. Merripen under the weather.\" \"I expect Merripen will heal very quickly,\" Amelia said with utter confidence. Other than the time he had first come to them, he had never been ill. \"He has a robust constitution.\" \"I\u0027ve requested the doctor to visit daily,\" Westcliff said. \"And if you have any difficulties, send word to Bristol. It isn\u0027t that far, and I\u0027ll come at once.\" Heaven knew how they had been fortunate enough to have Lillian and Westcliff as neighbors. Now, as Amelia made her way through the art gallery, her gaze moving over paintings and sculptures, she became aware of a terrible hollowness inside. She couldn\u0027t think how to make it go away. It wasn\u0027t hunger, fear, or anger, it wasn\u0027t exhaustion or dread. It was loneliness. Nonsense, she scolded herself, striding to a long row of windows that overlooked a side garden. It had begun to rain, a cold soaking glitter that fell steadily over the grounds and rushed in muddy streams toward the bluff and the river. You can\u0027t be lonely. He hasn\u0027t even been gone for half a day. And there\u0027s no reason for it when your entire family is here. It was the first time she had ever felt the kind of loneliness that couldn\u0027t be cured with just any available company. Sighing, she pressed her nose against the cold surface of a windowpane, while thunder sent vibrations through the glass. Her brother\u0027s voice came from the other side of the gallery. \"Mother always said that would flatten your nose.\" Pulling back, Amelia smiled as Leo approached her. \"She only said that because she didn\u0027t want me to make smudges on the glass.\" Her brother looked drawn and hollow-eyed, the pastiness of his complexion a striking contrast to Cam Rohan\u0027s clover-honey tan. Leo was dressed in borrowed clothes, these so fine and precisely tailored, they must have been donated by Lord St. Vincent. But instead of hanging gracefully as they did on St. Vincent\u0027s elegantly spare frame, the garments strained over Leo\u0027s bloated waist and puffy neck. \"One can only hope you feel better than you look,\" Amelia said. \"I\u0027ll feel better once I can find some decent refreshment. I\u0027ve asked thrice for wine or spirits, and the servants all seem damnably absentminded.\" She frowned. \"Surely it\u0027s too early in the day even for you, Leo.\" He extracted a pocket watch from his waistcoat and squinted at its face. \"It\u0027s eight o\u0027clock in Bombay. Being an internationally minded fellow, I\u0027ll have a drink as a diplomatic gesture.\" Ordinarily Amelia would have been resigned or annoyed. However, as she stared at her brother, who seemed so lost and miserable beneath his brittle facade, she felt a rash of compassion. Walking forward, she put her arms around him and hugged him. And wondered how to save him. Startled by the impulsive gesture, Leo remained still, not returning the embrace but not pulling away, either. His hands came to her shoulders, and he eased her away. \"I should have known you\u0027d be maudlin today,\" he said. \"Yes, well?finding one\u0027s brother nearly roasted to death tends to make a woman rather emotional.\" \"I\u0027m just a bit charred.\" He stared at her with those strange, light eyes, not at all the eyes of the brother she had known all her life. \"And not so altered as you, it seems.\" Amelia knew immediately what he was leading to. Warily she turned away from him and pretended to inspect a nearby landscape of hills and clouds and a silvery lake. \"Altered? I\u0027ve no idea what you mean.\" \"I\u0027m referring to the game of hide-the-slipper you\u0027ve been playing with Rohan.\" \"Who told you that? The servants?\" \"Merripen.\" \"I can\u0027t believe he dared? \"For once he and I agree on something. We\u0027re going back to London as soon as Merripen is welt enough. We\u0027ll stay at the Rutledge Hotel until we can find a suitable house to lease? \"The Rutledge costs a fortune,\" she exclaimed. \"We can\u0027t afford that.\" \"Don\u0027t argue, Amelia. I\u0027m the head of this family, and I\u0027ve made the decision. With Merripen\u0027s full support, for what that\u0027s worth.\" \"The two of you can go to blazes! I don\u0027t take orders from you, Leo.\" \"You will in this instance. Your affair with Rohan is over.\" Feeling bitter and outraged, Amelia turned away from him. She didn\u0027t trust herself to speak. In the past year, there had been so many times she had longed for Leo to assume his place as the head of the family, to have an opinion about anything, to show concern for someone othei than himself. And yet this was the issue that had provoked him to take action? \"I\u0027m so glad,\" she said with ominous quietness, \"that you\u0027ve taken such an interest in my personal affairs, Leo. Now perhaps you might expand your interest to other topics of importance, such as how and when Ramsay House will be rebuilt, and what we\u0027re going to do about Win\u0027s health, and Beatrix\u0027s education, and Poppy\u0027s? \"You won\u0027t distract me that easily. Good God, sis, couldn\u0027t you find someone of your own class to dally with? Have your prospects really sunk so low that you\u0027ve taken a Gypsy to your bed?\" Amelia\u0027s mouth dropped open. She spun to face him. \"I can\u0027t believe you would say such a thing. Our brother is a Roma, and he? \"Merripen isn\u0027t our brother. And he happens to agree with me. This is beneath you.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine-till-midnight-the-hathaways-1/page-70.html","bookId":1788,"book":{"id":1788,"title":"Mine Till Midnight (The Hathaways #1)","description":"Storyline: When an unexpected inheritance elevates her family to the ranks of the aristocracy, Amelia Hathaway discovers that tending to her younger sisters and wayward brother was easy compared to navigating the intricacies of the ton.

When the delectable Amelia appeals to him for help, he intends to offer only friendship—but intentions are no match for the desire that blindsides them both.
