{"id":78221,"no":36,"title":"Page 36","content":"Lillian\u0027s interactions with the child were quite unusual for an aristocratic household. Children were hardly ever brought out to see visitors unless it was a brief presentation, accompanied by a pat on the head and a quick departure. Most women of the countess\u0027s exalted position wouldn\u0027t see their own offspring more than once or twice a day, leaving the majority of child-rearing to the nanny and nursery maids.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t help wanting to see her,\" Lillian explained candidly. \"So the nursery servants have learned to tolerate my interference.\"\\n\\n When the tea tray arrived, Annie the doll was propped up on the settee between Poppy and Merritt. The little girl pressed the edge of her teacup against the doll\u0027s painted mouth. \"Annie wants more sugar, Mama,\" Merritt said.\\n\\n Lillian grinned, knowing who was going to drink the highly sweetened tea. \"Tell Annie we never have more than two lumps in a cup, darling. It will make her ill.\"\\n\\n \"But she has a sweet tooth,\" the child protested. She added ominously, \"A sweet tooth and a temper.\"\\n\\n Lillian shook her head with a tsk-tsk. \"Such a headstrong doll. Be firm with her, Merritt.\"\\n\\n Poppy, who had been watching the exchange with a grin, adopted a perplexed look and wriggled slightly on the settee. \"Dear me, I do believe I\u0027m sitting on something...\" She reached behind her and produced the little wooden horse, pretending she had found it lodged between the settee cushions.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s my horsie,\" Merritt exclaimed, her small fingers closing around the object. \"I thought he\u0027d run away!\"\\n\\n \"Thank goodness,\" Lillian said. \"Horsie is one of Merritt\u0027s favorite toys. The entire household has been searching for it.\"\\n\\n Amelia\u0027s smile wavered as she met Poppy\u0027s gaze, both of them wondering if it had been discovered that other things were missing. The stolen objects, especially the silver seal, must be returned as soon as possible. She cleared her throat. \"My lady?that is, Lillian?if you wouldn\u0027t mind... I should like to know where the convenience is?\\n\\n \"Oh, certainly. Shall I have a housemaid show you the way, or?\\n\\n \"No, thank you,\" Amelia said hastily.\\n\\n After receiving Lillian\u0027s matter-of-fact instructions. Amelia excused herself from the parlor, leaving the three of them to continue their tea.\\n\\n The first room she had to find was the library, where the stereoscope card and the key belonged. Recalling Beatrix\u0027s description of the main floor plan, Amelia hurried along the quiet hallway. She slowed her pace as she saw a maid sweeping the carpet, and tried to look as if she knew where she was going. The maid stopped sweeping and stood aside respectfully as she passed.\\n\\n Rounding a corner, Amelia found an open door revealing a large library with upper and lower galleries. Better yet, it was empty. She rushed inside and saw a stereoscope on the massive library table. There was a wooden box nearby, stuffed with cards just like the one in her pocket. Tucking the card in with the others, she hurried out of the library, pausing only to insert the key into the empty lock case of the door.\\n\\n Only one task left—she had to find Lord Westcliff\u0027s private study and return the silver seal. The weight of it bounced uncomfortably against her leg as she walked. Please don\u0027t let Lord Westcliff be there, she thought desperately. Please let it be empty. Please don\u0027t let me be caught.\\n\\n Beatrix had said the study was close to the library, but the first door Amelia tried turned out to be the music room. Spying another door across the hallway, she discovered a supplies closet filled with pails, brooms, rags, and pots of wax and polish.\\n\\n \"Blast, blast, blast,\" she muttered, rushing to another open doorway.\\n\\n It was a billiards room. And it was occupied by a half-dozen gentlemen involved in a game. Worse, one of them was Christopher Frost. His handsome face was devoid of expression as his gaze met hers.\\n\\n Amelia stopped, color flaring in her face. \"Do excuse me,\" she murmured, and fled.\\n\\n To her dismay, Christopher Frost moved as if to follow her. She was so intent on making her escape that she didn\u0027t see someone cut in front of Frost, neatly blocking him.\\n\\n \"Miss Hathaway.\"\\n\\n At the sound of a man\u0027s voice, Amelia whirled around. She expected to see Christopher Frost, but was startled to find that Cam Rohan had followed her. \"Sir.\"\\n\\n Cam Rohan was in his shirtsleeves, and his collar was a bit loose, as if he\u0027d been tugging on it. His jet-black hair was casually disordered, as if he\u0027d recently dragged his fingers through the shining layers. Her heart quickened. She waited stiffly as he approached her in fluid strides.\\n\\n Lingering in the doorway, Christopher Frost gave them a last frowning glance before retreating into the room.\\n\\n Rohan reached Amelia and stopped with a nod of greeting. \"Is there something I can help you with?\" he asked politely. \"Have you lost your way?\"\\n\\n Abandoning caution in favor of expediency, Amelia seized a fold of his rolled-up sleeve. \"Mr. Rohan, do you know where Lord Westcliff \u0027s study is?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, of course.\"\\n\\n \"Show me.\"\\n\\n Rohan looked at her with a quizzical smile. \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s no time to explain. Just take me there now. Please, let\u0027s hurry!\"\\n\\n Obligingly he led her across the hallway, two doors down, into a small rosewood-paneled room. A gentleman\u0027s study. The only ornamentation was a row of rectangular stained-glass windows along one wall. Here was where Marcus, Lord Westcliff, conducted most of his estate business.\\n\\n Rohan closed the door behind them. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine-till-midnight-the-hathaways-1/page-36.html","bookId":1788,"book":{"id":1788,"title":"Mine Till Midnight (The Hathaways #1)","description":"Storyline: When an unexpected inheritance elevates her family to the ranks of the aristocracy, Amelia Hathaway discovers that tending to her younger sisters and wayward brother was easy compared to navigating the intricacies of the ton.
