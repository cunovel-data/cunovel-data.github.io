You and I are calling tomorrow, whether or not it\u0027s a proper day.\"\\n\\n \"Shall I go too?\" Beatrix asked.\\n\\n \"No,\" Amelia and Poppy answered simultaneously. They were both thinking the same thing—that Beatrix might not be able to control herself during another visit.\\n\\n \"Thank you.\" Beatrix seemed relieved. \"Although I\u0027m sorry you have to undo my wrongs. I should be punished somehow. Perhaps I should confess and apologize?\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll resort to that if we\u0027re caught,\" Amelia said. \"First let\u0027s try covering it up.\"\\n\\n \"Do we have to tell Leo or Win or Merripen?\" Beatrix asked sheepishly.\\n\\n \"No,\" Amelia murmured, gathering her close and pressing her lips to her sister\u0027s unruly dark curls. \"We\u0027ll keep this between the three of us. Poppy and I will take care of everything, dear.\"\\n\\n \"All right. Thank you.\" Beatrix relaxed and nestled against her with a sigh. \"I only hope you can do it without getting caught.\"\\n\\n \"Of course we can,\" Poppy said brightly. \"Don\u0027t you worry for one moment.\"\\n\\n \"Problem solved,\" Amelia added.\\n\\n And above Beatrix\u0027s head, Amelia and Poppy looked at each other in shared panic.\\n\\n Chapter Ten\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know why Beatrix does these things,\" Poppy said the next morning, as Amelia held the ribbons of the barouche. They were on their way to Stony Cross Manor, with the stolen objects secreted in the pockets of their best day gowns.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m certain she doesn\u0027t mean to,\" Amelia replied, her forehead furrowed with worry. \"If it was intentional, Beatrix would steal things she truly wanted, like hair ribbons or gloves or candy, and she wouldn\u0027t confess afterward.\" She sighed. \"It seems to happen when there\u0027s been a significant change in her life. When Mother and Father died, and when Leo and Win fell ill... and now, when we\u0027ve uprooted ourselves and moved to Hampshire. We\u0027ll just smooth this over as best we can, and try to ensure that Beatrix is in a calm and serene atmosphere.\"\\n\\n \"There is no such thing as \u0027calm and serene\u0027 in our household,\" Poppy said glumly. \"Oh, Amelia, why must our family be so odd?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re not odd.\"\\n\\n Poppy batted her hands in a dismissive gesture. \"Odd people never think they\u0027re odd.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m perfectly ordinary,\" Amelia protested.\\n\\n \"Ha.\"\\n\\n Amelia glanced at her in surprise. \"Why in heaven\u0027s name would you say \u0027ha\u0027 to that?\"\\n\\n \"You try to manage everything and everyone. And you don\u0027t trust anyone outside the family. You\u0027re like a porcupine. No one can get past the quills.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I like that,\" Amelia said indignantly. \"Being compared to a large prickly rodent, when I\u0027ve decided to spend the rest of my entire life looking after the family?\\n\\n \"No one\u0027s asked that of you.\"\\n\\n \"Someone has to do it. And I\u0027m the oldest Hathaway.\"\\n\\n \"Leo\u0027s the oldest.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m the oldest sober Hathaway.\"\\n\\n \"That still doesn\u0027t mean you have to martyr yourself.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not a martyr, I\u0027m merely being responsible. And you\u0027re ungrateful!\"\\n\\n \"Would you prefer gratitude or a husband? Personally, I\u0027d take the husband.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want a husband.\"\\n\\n They bickered all the way to Stony Cross Manor. By the time they arrived, they were both cross and surly. However, as a footman came to assist them out, they pasted false smiles on their faces and linked tense arms as they walked to the front door.\\n\\n They waited in the entrance hall as the butler went to announce their arrival. To Amelia\u0027s vast relief, he showed them to the parlor and informed them that Lady Westcliff would be with them directly.\\n\\n Venturing farther into the airy parlor, with its vases of fresh flowers, and satinwood furniture and light blue silk upholstery, and the cheerful blaze in the white marble fireplace, Poppy exclaimed, \"Oh, it\u0027s so pretty in here, and it smells so lovely, and look how the windows sparkle!\"\\n\\n Amelia was silent, but she couldn\u0027t help agreeing. Seeing this immaculate parlor, so far removed from the dust and squalor of Ramsay House, made her feel guilty and sullen.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t take off your bonnet,\" she said as Poppy untied her ribbons. \"You\u0027re supposed to leave it on during a formal call.\"\\n\\n \"Only in town,\" Poppy argued. \"In the country, etiquette is more relaxed. And I hardly think Lady Westcliff would mind.\"\\n\\n A woman\u0027s voice came from the doorway. \"Mind what?\" It was Lady Westcliff, her slender form clad in a pink gown, her dark hair gathered at the back of her head in shining curls. Her smile was wrought of mischief and easy charm. She held hands with a dark-haired toddler in a blue dress, a miniature version of herself with big round eyes the color of gingerbread.\\n\\n \"My lady ...\" Amelia and Poppy both bowed. Deciding to be frank, Amelia said, \"Lady Westcliff, we were just debating whether or not we should remove our bonnets.\"\\n\\n \"Good God, don\u0027t bother with formality,\" Lady Westcliff exclaimed, coming in with the child. \"Off with the bonnets, by all means. And do call me Lillian. This is my daughter, Merritt. She and I are having a bit of playtime before her morning nap.\"\\n\\n \"I hope we\u0027re not interrupting? Poppy began apologetically.\\n\\n \"Not at all. If you can tolerate our romping during your visit, we\u0027re more than happy to have you, I\u0027ve sent for tea.\" Before long they were all chatting easily. Merritt quickly lost all vestige of shyness and showed them her favorite doll named Annie, and a collection of pebbles and leaves from her pocket. Lady Westcliff—Lillian—was an openly affectionate and playful mother, showing no compunction about kneeling on the floor to look for fallen pebbles beneath the table. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine-till-midnight-the-hathaways-1/page-35.html","bookId":1788,"book":{"id":1788,"title":"Mine Till Midnight (The Hathaways #1)","description":"Storyline: When an unexpected inheritance elevates her family to the ranks of the aristocracy, Amelia Hathaway discovers that tending to her younger sisters and wayward brother was easy compared to navigating the intricacies of the ton.
