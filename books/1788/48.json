The only real challenge left is marriage.\"\\n\\n Marriage. Respectability. Cam regarded his companions with a skeptical smile, thinking they resembled a pair of birds trying to convince themselves of how comfortable their cage was. No woman was worth having his wings clipped.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m leaving for London tomorrow,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll stay at the club until it reopens. After that I\u0027ll be gone for good.\"\\n\\n St. Vincent\u0027s clever mind circumvented the problem, analyzing it from various angles. \"Rohan... you\u0027ve led a more or less civilized existence for years, and yet suddenly it has become intolerable. Why?\"\\n\\n Cam remained silent. The truth was not something he was readily able to admit to himself, let alone say aloud.\\n\\n \"There has to be some reason you want to leave,\" St. Vincent persisted.\\n\\n \"Perhaps I\u0027m off the mark,\" Westcliff said, \"but I suspect it may have something to do with Miss Hathaway.\"\\n\\n Cam sent him a damning glare.\\n\\n St. Vincent looked alertly from Cam\u0027s stony face to Westcliff\u0027s. \"You didn\u0027t tell me there was a woman.\"\\n\\n Cam stood so quickly the chair nearly toppled backward. \"She has nothing to do with it.\"\\n\\n \"Who is she?\" St. Vincent always hated being left out of gossip.\\n\\n \"One of Lord Ramsay\u0027s sisters,\" came Westcliff\u0027s reply. \"They reside at the estate next door.\"\\n\\n \"Well, well,\" St. Vincent said. \"She must be quite something to provoke such a reaction in you, Rohan. Tell me about her. Is she fair? Dark? Well formed?\"\\n\\n To remain silent, or to deny the attraction, would have been to admit the full extent of his weakness. Cam lowered back into his chair and strove for an offhand tone. \"Dark-haired. Pretty. And she has?quirks.\"\\n\\n \"Quirks.\" St. Vincent\u0027s eyes glinted with enjoyment. \"How charming. Go on.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s read obscure medieval philosophy. She\u0027s afraid of bees. Her foot taps when she\u0027s nervous.\" And other, more personal things he couldn\u0027t reveal?like the beautiful paleness of her throat and chest, the weight of her hair in his hands, the way strength and vulnerability were pleated inside her like two pieces of fabric folded together. Not to mention a body that had been designed for mortal sin.\\n\\n Cam didn\u0027t want to think about Amelia. Every time he did, he was swamped with a feeling he\u0027d never known before, something as acute as pain, as pervasive as hunger. The feeling seemed to have no purpose other than to rob him of sleep at night. There wasn\u0027t one millimeter of Amelia Hathaway that didn\u0027t attract him profoundly, and that was a problem so far outside his experience, he didn\u0027t begin to know how to address it.\\n\\n If only he could take her, ease this endless ache... but having lain with her once, he might want her even more afterward. In mathematics, one could take a finite figure and divide its content infinitely, with the result that even though the content was unchanged, the magnitude of its bounds went on forever. Potential infinity. It was the first time Cam had ever comprehended the concept in the form of a woman. Aware that Westcliff and St. Vincent had exchanged a significant glance, Cam said sourly, \"If you\u0027re assuming that my plans to leave are nothing more than a reaction to Miss Hathaway... I\u0027ve been considering this for a long time. I\u0027m not an idiot. Nor am I inexperienced with women.\"\\n\\n \"To say the least,\" St. Vincent commented dryly. \"But in your pursuit of women—or perhaps I should say their pursuit of you—you seem to have regarded them all as interchangeable. Until now. If you are taken with this Hathaway creature, don\u0027t you think it bears investigating?\"\\n\\n \"God, no. There\u0027s only one thing it could lead to.\"\\n\\n \"Marriage,\" the viscount said rather than asked.\\n\\n \"Yes. And that\u0027s impossible.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n The fact that they were discussing Amelia Hathaway and the subject of marriage was enough to make Cam blanch in discomfort. \"I\u0027m not the marrying kind?\\n\\n St. Vincent snorted. \"No man is. Marriage is a female invention.\"\\n\\n \"—but even if I were so inclined,\" Cam continued, \"I\u0027m a Roma. I wouldn\u0027t do that to her.\"\\n\\n There was no need to elucidate. Decent gadjis didn\u0027t marry Gypsies. His blood was mixed, and even though Amelia herself might harbor no prejudices, the routine discriminations Cam encountered would certainly extend to his wife and children. And if that wasn\u0027t bad enough, his own people would be even more disapproving of the match. Gadje Gadjensa, Rom Romensa?Gadje with Gadje, Roma with Roma.\\n\\n \"What if your heritage made no difference to her?\" Westcliff asked quietly.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not the point. It\u0027s how others would view her.\" Seeing that the older man was about to argue, Cam murmured, \"Tell me, would either of you wish your daughter to marry a Gypsy?\" In the face of their discomforted silence, he smiled without amusement.\\n\\n After a moment, Westcliff stubbed out his cigar in a deliberate, methodical fashion. \"Obviously you\u0027ve made up your mind. Further debate would be pointless.\"\\n\\n St. Vincent followed his lead with a resigned shrug and a facile smile. \"I suppose now I\u0027m obliged to wish you happiness in your new life. Although happiness in the absence of indoor plumbing is a debatable concept.\"\\n\\n Cam was undeceived by the show of resignation. He had never known Westcliff or St. Vincent to lose an argument easily. Each, in his own way, would hold his ground long after the average man would have collapsed to his knees. Which made Cam fairly certain he hadn\u0027t heard the last word from either of them yet. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine-till-midnight-the-hathaways-1/page-48.html","bookId":1788,"book":{"id":1788,"title":"Mine Till Midnight (The Hathaways #1)","description":"Storyline: When an unexpected inheritance elevates her family to the ranks of the aristocracy, Amelia Hathaway discovers that tending to her younger sisters and wayward brother was easy compared to navigating the intricacies of the ton.
