Watching him, Amelia felt as if she were trapped in a waking nightmare.\\n\\n \"Nothing\u0027s here,\" Cam said, sounding astonishingly calm.\\n\\n Now Christopher seemed to take a vicious satisfaction in the situation. \"You\u0027ve hardly looked. Go inside and don\u0027t come out without it.\"\\n\\n Tears sprang to Amelia\u0027s eyes. \"You\u0027re a monster,\" she said furiously. \"There\u0027s nothing in there, and you know it.\"\\n\\n \"Look at you,\" he said, sneering, \"weeping over your Gypsy lover. How low you\u0027ve fallen.\"\\n\\n Before she could respond, a blue-white burst of light filled the room in a noiseless strike. The lamp flame was extinguished in a freezing blast. Amelia blinked and rubbed the moisture from her eyes, and turned in a bewildered circle as she tried to find the source of the light. Something shimmered all around them, coldness and brilliance and raw energy. She stumbled toward Cam with her arms outstretched. The bees lifted in a mass and flew back to the hive, the blue light causing their wings to glitter like a rain of sparks.\\n\\n Amelia reached Cam, and he caught her in a warm, hard grip. \"Are you hurt?\" she asked, her hands frantically searching him.\\n\\n \"No, just a sting or two. I? He broke off with a sharp inhalation.\\n\\n Twisting in his arms, Amelia followed his gaze. Two hazy forms, distorted in the broken light, struggled for possession of the gun. Who was it? Who else had come into the room? Not a heartbeat had passed before Cam had shoved her to the floor. \"Stay down.\" Without pausing, he launched himself toward the combatants.\\n\\n But they had already broken apart, one man tumbling to the floor with the pistol in his grip, the other running for the door. Cam went for the fallen man, while the air crackled as if the room were filled with burning Catherine wheels. The other man fled. And the door slammed shut behind him?although no one had touched it.\\n\\n Dazed, Amelia sat up, while the fractured light dissolved into a faint blue radiance that clung to the outlines of the men nearby. \"Cam?\" she asked uncertainly.\\n\\n His voice was low and shaken. \"It\u0027s all right, hummingbird. Come here.\"\\n\\n She reached them and gasped as she saw the intruder\u0027s face. \"Leo. What are you—how did you? Her voice faltered at the sight of the pistol in his hand. He held it loosely against his thigh. His face was calm, his mouth curved with a faint wry smile.\\n\\n \"I was going to ask you the same thing,\" Leo said mildly. \"What the devil are you doing here?\"\\n\\n Amelia sank to the floor beside Cam, her gaze remaining on her brother. \"Poppy found your note,\" she said breathlessly. \"We came here because we thought you were going to?to do yourself in.\"\\n\\n \"That was the general idea,\" Leo said. \"But I went to the tavern for a drink on the way. And when I finally got here, it was a bit crowded for my taste. Suicide is something a fellow likes a bit of privacy for.\"\\n\\n Amelia was unnerved by his tranquil manner. Her gaze fell to the pistol in his hand, then returned to his face. Her hand crept to Cam\u0027s tense thigh. The ghost was with them, she thought. The air had turned her face numb, making it difficult to move her lips. \"Mr. Frost was treasure-hunting,\" she told her brother.\\n\\n Leo gave her a skeptical glance. \"A treasure, in this rubbish pile?\"\\n\\n \"Well, you see, Mr. Frost thought?\\n\\n \"No, don\u0027t bother. I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t summon any interest in what Frost thought. The idiot.\" He looked down at the pistol, his thumb gently grazing the barrel.\\n\\n Amelia wouldn\u0027t have expected a man contemplating suicide to appear so relaxed. A ruined man in a ruined house. Every line of his body spoke of weary resignation. He looked at Cam. \"You need to take her out of here,\" he said quietly.\\n\\n \"Leo? Amelia had begun to tremble, knowing that if they left him here, he would kill himself. She could think of nothing to say, at least nothing that wouldn\u0027t sound theatrical, unconvincing, absurd.\\n\\n Her brother\u0027s mouth quirked as if he were too exhausted to smile. \"I know,\" he said gently. \"I know what you want, and what you don\u0027t want. I know you wish I could be better than this. But I\u0027m not.\"\\n\\n He blurred before her. Amelia felt tears sliding from her eyes, the wetness turning icy by the time they reached her chin. \"I don\u0027t want to lose you.\"\\n\\n Leo bent both his knees and braced an arm across them, his fingers remaining curled around the gun handle. \"I\u0027m not your brother, Amelia. Not anymore. I changed when Laura died.\"\\n\\n \"I still want you.\"\\n\\n \"No one gets what they want,\" Leo muttered. \"Not now.\"\\n\\n Cam watched her brother intently. A long silence unfolded in pained degrees, while a burning cold breeze fanned over the three of them. \"I could try to persuade you to set the gun aside, and go home with us,\" he said eventually. \"To hold off one more day. But even if I stopped you this time... one can\u0027t keep a man alive when he doesn\u0027t want to be.\"\\n\\n \"True,\" Leo said.\\n\\n Amelia opened her mouth with a shuddering protest, but Cam stopped her, his fingers pressing gently over her lips. Cam continued to stare at Leo, not with concern but a sort of detached contemplation, as if he were focusing on some mathematical equation. \"No one can be haunted,\" he said quietly, \"without having willed it. You know that, don\u0027t you?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine-till-midnight-the-hathaways-1/page-93.html","bookId":1788,"book":{"id":1788,"title":"Mine Till Midnight (The Hathaways #1)","description":"Storyline: When an unexpected inheritance elevates her family to the ranks of the aristocracy, Amelia Hathaway discovers that tending to her younger sisters and wayward brother was easy compared to navigating the intricacies of the ton.
