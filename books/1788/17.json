{"id":78203,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"Amelia couldn\u0027t help but agree. In her experience scholarly men such as her father were pale from spending much of their time indoors, and they had paunches and spectacles and rumpled, tweedy appearances. They were hot exotic young men who looked like pagan princes and had gold rings and tattoos.\\n\\n \"Miss Hathaway,\" Lord Westcliff said, \"to my knowledge, there hasn\u0027t been a Ramsay in residence in nearly a decade. I find it difficult to believe the house is habitable.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, it\u0027s in fine condition,\" Amelia lied brightly, her pride rising to the fore. \"Of course, some dusting is needed—and a few minor repairs—but we are quite comfortable.\"\\n\\n She thought she had spoken convincingly, but Westcliff looked skeptical. \"We are having a large supper at Stony Cross Manor this evening,\" he said. \"You will bring your family. It will be an excellent opportunity for you to meet some local residents, including the vicar.\"\\n\\n A supper with Lord and Lady Westcliff. Heaven help her.\\n\\n Had the Hathaway family been well-rested, had Leo been a bit further along on the path of sobriety, had they all possessed suitable formal attire, had they been given enough time to study etiquette... Amelia might have considered accepting the invitation. But as things were, it was impossible. \"You are very kind, my lord, but I must decline. We\u0027ve only just arrived in Hampshire, and most of our clothes are still packed away?\\n\\n \"The occasion is informal.\"\\n\\n Amelia doubted his definition of \"informal\" matched hers. \"It\u0027s not merely a matter of attire, my lord. One of my sisters is somewhat frail, and it would be too taxing for her. She needs a great deal of rest after the long journey from London.\"\\n\\n \"Tomorrow night, then. It will be a much smaller affair, and not at all taxing.\"\\n\\n In light of his insistence, there was no way to refuse. Cursing herself for not staying at Ramsay House that morning, Amelia forced a smile to her lips. \"Very well, my lord. Your hospitality is much appreciated.\"\\n\\n Rohan returned, his breath quickened from exertion. A mist of sweat had accumulated on his skin until it gleamed like bronze. \"Right on course,\" he said to Westcliff and Swansea. \u0027The stabilizing fins worked. It landed at a distance of approximately two thousand yards.\"\\n\\n \"Excellent!\" Swansea exclaimed. \"But where is the rocket?\"\\n\\n Rohan\u0027s white teeth flashed in a grin. \"Buried in a deep, smoking hole. I\u0027ll go back to dig it up later.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, we\u0027ll want to see the condition of the casing and the inner core.\" Swansea was red-faced with satisfaction. He used a handkerchief to blot his steaming, wrinkled countenance. \"It\u0027s been an exciting morning, eh?\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps it\u0027s time to return to the manor, Captain,\" Westcliff suggested.\\n\\n \"Yes, quite.\" Swansea bowed to Amelia. \"A pleasure, Miss Hathaway. And may I say, you took it rather well, being the target of a surprise attack.\"\\n\\n \u0027The next time I visit, Captain,\" she said, \"I\u0027ll remember to bring my white flag.\"\\n\\n He chuckled and bid her farewell.\\n\\n Before turning to join the captain, Lord Westcliff glanced at Cam Rohan. \"I\u0027ll take Swansea back to the manor, if you\u0027ll see to it that Miss Hathaway is delivered home safely.\"\\n\\n \"Of course,\" came the unhesitating reply.\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" Amelia said, \"but there\u0027s no need. I know the way, and it isn\u0027t far.\"\\n\\n Her protest was ignored. She was left to stare uneasily at Cam Rohan, while the other two men departed.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m hardly some helpless female,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t need to be delivered anywhere. Besides, in light of your past behavior, I\u0027d be safer going alone.\"\\n\\n A brief silence. Rohan tilted his head and regarded her curiously. \"Past behavior?\"\\n\\n \"You know what I? She broke off, flushing at the memory of the kiss in the darkness. \"I\u0027m referring to what happened in London.\"\\n\\n He gave her a look of polite perplexity. \"I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t follow.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not going to pretend you don\u0027t remember,\" she exclaimed. Perhaps he had, kissed so many legions of women, he couldn\u0027t possibly recollect them all. \"Are you also going to deny that you stole one of my bonnet ribbons?\"\\n\\n \"You have a vivid imagination, Miss Hathaway.\" His tone was bland. But there was a flare of provoking laughter in his eyes.\\n\\n \"I have no such thing. The rest of my family is steeped in imagination—I\u0027m the one who clings desperately to reality.\" She turned and began to walk at a brisk pace. \"I\u0027m going home. There\u0027s no need for you to accompany me.\"\\n\\n Ignoring her statement, Rohan fell easily into step beside her, his relaxed stride accounting for every two of hers. He let her set their pace. In the openness of their surroundings, he seemed even larger than she had remembered. \"When you saw my arm,\" he murmured, \"the tattoo ... how did you know it was a pooka?\"\\n\\n Amelia took her time about replying. As they walked, the shadows of nearby branches crossed their faces. A red-tailed hawk glided across the sky and disappeared into the heavy wood. \"I\u0027ve read some Irish folklore,\" she finally said. \"A wicked, dangerous creature, the pooka. Invented to give people nightmares. Why would you adorn yourself with such a design?\"\\n\\n \"It was given to me as a child. I don\u0027t remember when it was done.\"\\n\\n \"For what purpose? What significance does it have?\"\\n\\n \"My family would never explain.\" Rohan shrugged. \"Perhaps they might now. But it\u0027s been years since I\u0027ve seen them.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine-till-midnight-the-hathaways-1/page-17.html","bookId":1788,"book":{"id":1788,"title":"Mine Till Midnight (The Hathaways #1)","description":"Storyline: When an unexpected inheritance elevates her family to the ranks of the aristocracy, Amelia Hathaway discovers that tending to her younger sisters and wayward brother was easy compared to navigating the intricacies of the ton.
