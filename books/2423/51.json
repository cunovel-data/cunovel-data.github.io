{"id":77335,"no":51,"title":"Page 51","content":"She picked her way downstream until she came to what she needed—a fallen tree, the trunk making a bridge across to the other side.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t wait to get up her nerve. She could be across in three big steps.\\n\\n But she\u0027d underestimated how slick the bark was, how much it would bend and shift under her weight. She was halfway when she slipped, threw her walking stick into the air, and pitched into the water.\\n\\n Her arm struck something hard. Water surged into her nostrils. Her clothes weighed her down; the current spun her and rushed her backwards downstream. She tried to stand, only to be swept back in. Finally, she clawed herself to the bank, pulling herself up by a tree root, and collapsed in the mud, gasping and nauseated.\\n\\n Stupid. Race would laugh in your damn face.\\n\\n She had no idea how far she\u0027d been carried. She couldn\u0027t see the tree trunk she\u0027d tried to cross. Her whole body trembled, and she wasn\u0027t sure whether it was from the cold or the shock, but she realized it didn\u0027t matter. She needed to move. She needed to get warm immediately.\\n\\n And then she noticed her backpack was gone.\\n\\n She walked downstream for a long way, but there was no sign of the pack. It had been ripped off her back and carried away.\\n\\n Now, for the first time, Mallory felt truly alone. She looked at the GPS bracelet—that small green eye glowing at her, daring her to give up. She was in deep trouble. She could die out here. Just her goddamn luck, to freeze to death in Texas.\\n\\n No, she told herself. You can do this.\\n\\n But the darkening sky and the river and the trees seemed to be telling her otherwise.\\n\\n She tried to remember what Leyland had told her to do in an emergency.\\n\\n S.O.S. Survey. Organize. Strategize.\\n\\n Okay, the survey was easy. Night was falling. She was wet and cold—her clothes soaked through, her backpack and med kit and thermal sleeping bag gone. Her limbs felt numb.\\n\\n Mallory organized her supplies. She stripped off her jacket. She checked her leg sheath to make sure the knife was still there. The metal match they\u0027d shown her how to use was still in her pocket. That was it. That\u0027s all she had.\\n\\n Strategize? She needed warmth, right away. She needed to make a fire.\\n\\n The only good thing that had come from her river ride was that she seemed to have lost whoever or whatever was following her. She couldn\u0027t hear it anymore—didn\u0027t feel its anger. Fire light might attract it to her again, but she had no choice. She had to have warmth.\\n\\n After a fire, she\u0027d create a shelter. She\u0027d have to spend the night here, move on in the morning. Thirdly—only thirdly—she\u0027d need to satisfy the gnawing hunger in her stomach.\\n\\n She\u0027d done lots of fires in base camp. It had been one of the prerequisites for the solo trip. Nevertheless, she had to remember the steps, mentally walking herself through.\\n\\n She found an enormous tree that was hollow inside and decided that would be her shelter. She\u0027d build her fire next to it. She used the hard dirt as her platform, put down a wrist-sized branch for the brace, piled the tinder on this. It took her three strikes to spark a flame to the tinder, and by that time her fingers were losing feeling. In a few minutes, though, she\u0027d started a curl of fire and began to add the kindling. She got to the fuel stage, began adding larger twigs, then small logs.\\n\\n She stood as close to the blaze as she could, feeling like something that had been pulled prematurely from the microwave—boiling on one side, frozen on the other.\\n\\n A dot of ice melted on her cheek. She looked up. Snowflakes were falling, a scatter of oversized dust motes evaporating in the halo of her fire.\\n\\n Great. Just great.\\n\\n When her hands felt warm enough to work, she began cleaning out the tree trunk. Grubs and worms and beetles squirmed out of the dark, and these she threw onto the tarp of her jacket by the fire. Just in case, she told herself. Just in case.\\n\\n By the time dusk was truly setting in, she had made her shelter. The snow had begun to stick to the ground like a crust of salt. Mallory backed into her hollow tree, now lined with moss and grass, and kept the fire blazing. She drank spring water from her canteen, but she avoided the grubs for now.\\n\\n She couldn\u0027t seem to control her shivering. She wondered if hypothermia could set in so quickly.\\n\\n She imagined she was back on the ropes course above the river, suspended in the dark, her harness tearing. She was ready to make a deal with God, to get her the hell out of here.\\n\\n Her last visit to her father\u0027s, just before she\u0027d run away to the East Bay, she had walked into his bedroom and found him on his knees, his back to her, hunched over his bed in his business suit, praying. She couldn\u0027t have been more embarrassed if she\u0027d found him in his underwear. Her dad, who\u0027d never been to church in his life, who\u0027d told her when she was a kid that God was a fairy tale, like Cinderella—her dad was praying. He didn\u0027t notice her. His fingers were laced, his lips almost kissing them as he spoke.\\n\\n She\u0027d stayed just long enough to hear him pleading quietly, promising God he would give anything. Please.\\n\\n Then she\u0027d left, easing the door closed behind her.\\n\\n She understood finally what he\u0027d been praying for . . . Her.\\n\\n She\u0027d blown up at him, cursed him, called him a monster because he didn\u0027t like Race, because he\u0027d hit her mother once, years ago.\\n\\n She had hurt him, just like Pérez said, and all he wanted was for her to be safe.\\n\\n He\u0027d sent Pérez to get her. That was a way of telling her he loved her. A twisted way, maybe. But he had tried.\\n\\n She started crying—knowing that the tears were some damn chemical imbalance, her period making everything seem worse than it was.\\n\\n Her dad was gone. She wanted to think she\u0027d feel a hole in her heart if he were dead, but she wasn\u0027t sure.\\n\\n This was her mother\u0027s fault—her mother and Chadwick. They had started everything going wrong, just because they wanted to fuck each other. They\u0027d ruined two families. Her father\u0027s disappearance was on their heads.\\n\\n Maybe Chadwick had treated her okay. Maybe he was even serious about helping her. Maybe, for a while, when she was scared in Fredericksburg, she\u0027d even thought about confiding in him. But in the end, Mallory knew the main reason she hadn\u0027t told her dream about Katherine to anyone wasn\u0027t that she didn\u0027t believe the dream. She wanted to see what would happen if her worst suspicions were right. She wanted to see Chadwick punished.\\n\\n She huddled into her hollow tree, facing the flames, her knife at her side. Her empty stomach seemed to be ripping itself out of her body. And as the night grew dark, her only company was the river and the fire and the sound of the hills moaning as they contracted under a hard freeze.\\n\\n 33\\n\\n Race was crazy to be at the café. He knew that.\\n\\n But he needed time to think. He had a decision to make. And he was running out of places to go.\\n\\n He sat down at the sidewalk table where a month ago Mallory had been taken from him. He stared at a half-empty coffee glass, a chess game the last customers had left unfinished.\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t go back to Nana\u0027s apartment. The visit from Chadwick and Jones had unhinged the old lady, made her start drinking and having conversations with Samuel and Talia in the middle of the night, and Race couldn\u0027t handle that shit.\\n\\n His mother\u0027s house was sold—some family with a U-Haul already moved in. Race had stood down the block, watching as a boy lugged his wagon of toys up the front steps, a little girl kicked a soccer ball around the stumps of the palm trees like relay race cones.\\n\\n Last night, he had stayed in the abandoned apartment building behind the café—up at the top of the stairwell where he and Mallory had made love. The BART trains rattled the windows, and a couple of derelicts in the gutted apartment below him had kept him awake, squabbling about laundry money. Race had kept his .22 semiautomatic in his improvised ankle-strap, close enough where he could reach it, just in case they came up the stairs. He didn\u0027t sleep until dawn, when the homeless guys wandered out to find their morning booze.\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t handle being in the stairwell another night. Not because of the derelicts, but because the old carpet still smelled of Mallory. Her scent reminded him of their final night together—being pressed against her, how she would pinch his ears, letting him know when he was being too rough. The whole thing had been wrong—as wrong as finding her the heroin she wanted, feeding the death wish that made her want to turn into Katherine. But Race had followed her lead. He always did. And now he was trying hard not to think about her.\\n\\n During the afternoon, he\u0027d stolen a bike and made the long ride up into the hills—to the condo above the Caldecott Tunnel. He\u0027d been hoping to find some money, but the place had been cleaned out, as if for good. That made Race nervous, made him wonder what was going on. He thought about staying there overnight, but the idea made his throat go dry. The place had worse ghosts than his mother\u0027s house; evil breathed into the air like corpse odor from the five or six years it had been occupied—radios and televisions playing in every room, twenty-four hours a day, to drown out the hatred.\\n\\n Now it was night again, and he was back at his and Mallory\u0027s favorite café, where he had failed so miserably to help her.\\n\\n He shivered, pulled his camouflage coat around himself. It stank. He stank. He had five twenty-dollar bills left—enough to eat for a few days, but this was a miserable time of year to sleep on the street.\\n\\n He had to make a choice.\\n\\n Race took out Chadwick\u0027s card, fingered the worn edge. He\u0027d looked at this card every day. He\u0027d memorized the damn number. He\u0027d even called it once, but he\u0027d gotten a machine, and hung up.\\n\\n He could call again. He could even go to the city, to Norma Reyes\u0027 house. He would tell her first. Then she would help him. She would make the call for him, protect him from the consequences. He had known for years—ever since the day she defended him against that idiot who called him a monkey in fourth grade—that Miss Reyes was somebody he could trust. It had something to do with the sadness in her eyes, the loneliness that reminded him of his mom, those few times she was between men, when she wasn\u0027t high or drunk, and she paid attention to him. He could go to Norma Reyes.\\n\\n Or he could do what he\u0027d been told. He could wait and be silent.\\n\\n He thought about Samuel—his dead big brother, whose memory had been resurrected to serve as a monster\u0027s skin.\\n\\n She had promised no one else would die. She had promised to come back for Race and give him a fresh start, a new school, an easy life with plenty of money.\\n\\n But she had also promised he would graduate from Laurel Heights. She said he could go to college, study history, get a Ph.D. if he wanted to. He could rewrite African-American history and turn the fucking world on its head.\\n\\n She\u0027d broken her promise.\\n\\n For a while, his future had been part of her revenge—a thorn in the Zedmans\u0027 sides that served her purpose. Now, he was just a loose end.\\n\\n Race hadn\u0027t seen her for days, but he had no illusions. She could find him at a moment\u0027s notice. She had almost killed him for saying as much as he had—for leaving the apartment, trying to warn Miss Reyes.\\n\\n It would be stupid to cross her twice.\\n\\n He stared at the chipped chess pieces on the table, thought of Mallory teaching him the game, years ago, in third grade. She\u0027d always told him he was smarter than she was, but in chess, like everything else, she always outmaneuvered him.\\n\\n Inside the café, the evening crowd was settling in with herbal tea and baguette sandwiches. White families, white college students glanced at him apprehensively. When he caught their eye, they stared past him, pretending to be looking somewhere else. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cold-springs/page-51.html","bookId":2423,"book":{"id":2423,"title":"Cold Springs","description":"Storyline: The death of a child ripples effects on all around her - whether accident, suicide, or murder.
