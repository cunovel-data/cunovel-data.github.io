{"id":77321,"no":37,"title":"Page 37","content":"“I can\u0027t!”\n “Other hand!”\n “I can\u0027t!”\n Leyland came into view again, frantically hooking cables to his harness, his left foot already out on the bridge.\n There was another Velcro rip, and Mallory dropped another millimeter, her one good handgrip on the slick rope slipping away.\n She could hear confused voices below now—Dr. Hunter, the other kids shouting through the storm.\n This isn\u0027t happening to me. It isn\u0027t.\n She realized her shoulder didn\u0027t feel so constricted now. The belt around her waist was loose. She was unraveling in midair.\n “Please, God . . .” Her voice didn\u0027t sound like her own.\n “Right above you!” It was Olsen. “No—I mean left. The rope, Mallory! It\u0027s right there.”\n “Where?”\n She felt the line trembling through her harness as Leyland worked his way toward her—too far away. Much too far. This isn\u0027t happening to me.\n Another ripping noise, and then the foot line bowed against her forearm, and she grabbed it, shaking off a string of raindrops into her face. She got her other hand on the line. Olsen was yelling encouragement, urging her to hang on.\n Then Leyland was there, lifting her up with one arm, making sure her feet found the bridge. He crushed her against him with one arm, and they slid together—across the river. Even after they reached the opposite platform, after Leyland had threaded an emergency line around her waist and rappelled her to the ground—Mallory still felt the world swaying. She crumpled onto all fours, soaked and shivering.\n “Just get me down,” she mumbled, her eyes squeezed shut. “Get me down.”\n “Zedman, you\u0027re all right now.” Hunter\u0027s huge hand was gripping her shoulder. Then his tone hardened. “Leyland, what happened?”\n “Look,” Leyland said. He tugged lightly on Mallory\u0027s back strap—something she couldn\u0027t see, didn\u0027t want to see.\n Hunter snapped, “Get it off her.”\n Mallory\u0027s hands curled in the moss and the wet leaves. Her vision went black and she vomited, heaving all the terror out of her body, everything she had ever feared—from Talia Montrose\u0027s torn body to her father\u0027s fists to Katherine leaving her, disappearing into the yellow house with the dark doorway and the ivy made of iron.\n “Zedman.” Hunter\u0027s voice was smaller now, like it had been compressed to fit in the barrel of a gun. “You\u0027re all right, Zedman. Look. The harness ripped.”\n And she looked up, saw him holding the strap that had almost killed her, the rip sprouting tufts of orange synthetic fiber.\n “It\u0027s okay,” Hunter said. “The main thing is you\u0027re safe.”\n But she could hear the anger in his voice, and she could see the strap as well as he could—the truth that no amount of reassurance could make all right. The tear line was perfectly straight—the strap had been cut.\n 19\n The Marin County Sheriff\u0027s Office found no body at John Zedman\u0027s house, no sign of forced entry except for Chadwick\u0027s.\n They couldn\u0027t locate John Zedman, nor his car, nor his driver, Emilio Pérez. Zedman\u0027s only two neighbors on the cul-de-sac had seen or heard nothing suspicious in the past twenty-four hours. But then, they hadn\u0027t noticed Chadwick drive up, or Sergeant Damarodas\u0027 arrival twenty minutes later, or the caravan of sheriff\u0027s vehicles with lights flashing that followed. As Chadwick figured it, their ocean views were so expensive the neighbors lost money every time they looked street-side.\n The splatters in John\u0027s bathroom were definitely blood. The hole in the living room wall was definitely a bullet hole.\n Past that, Detective Prost of the Marin County Investigations Division wasn\u0027t prepared to say. He was much too busy enjoying Chadwick\u0027s company. Even after an hour of interrogation, Prost was not anxious to let him go.\n “So your relationship with Mr. Zedman,” Detective Prost recapped for the twentieth time. “You wouldn\u0027t characterize it as friendly.”\n “I\u0027d characterize it as irrelevant,” Chadwick replied. “There\u0027s blood in his goddamn bathroom. Maybe you ought to try looking for him.”\n Prost reached across the kitchen counter, helped himself to some of John\u0027s gourmet coffee.\n Prost didn\u0027t look at Sergeant Damarodas, who was leaning against the refrigerator behind him, but Chadwick could feel the tension between the two policemen. Citing the need for interdepartmental cooperation, Damarodas had politely insisted on staying, and the local cops moved around him with a flustered kind of annoyance—the way pedestrians move around public modern art.\n “Mr. Chadwick,” Prost said. “John Zedman\u0027s ex-wife was your employer at Laurel Heights. Correct?”\n “The answer was yes an hour ago,” Chadwick said. “It\u0027s still yes.”\n “You and Mrs. Zedman keep in touch since?”\n “Not really.”\n “No? So after nine years of not keeping in touch, she calls you out of the blue to help kidnap her daughter—”\n “Escort,” Chadwick corrected. “Legally escort. At the custodial parent\u0027s request.”\n “Escort.” Prost nodded neutrally. “And at the time of the escort, two weeks ago, did you speak to John Zedman?”\n “No.”\n “Yet this afternoon, you visited him.”\n “That\u0027s right.”\n “By your own account, there was an argument. You accused John Zedman of causing his ex\u0027s financial troubles—the ones that made the headlines this morning.”\n “I discussed the matter with him.”\n “The friend you paged to come up here, the lady waiting outside—Ms. Jones? She implied it was a little worse than a discussion.”\n Chadwick caught Damarodas\u0027 eyes.\n In some ways, the sergeant had been less than Chadwick expected from talking to him on the phone—not over five-ten, cheap suit, pale skin and brown hair and facial features that reminded Chadwick of an overgrown field mouse—but his eyes were startling blue and sharp. The message in those eyes was a silent warning, No.\n “John and I had a discussion,” Chadwick told Prost. “That\u0027s all.”\n “I see. So when you came back this evening and broke into Mr. Zedman\u0027s house—you did that just to check on Mr. Zedman\u0027s welfare. Do I have that right?”\n “Detective, we\u0027ve been through this. Unless you\u0027re charging me with something—”\n Prost spread his hands. “Oh, you\u0027re free to go anytime, Mr. Chadwick. Tom!”\n A bored-looking deputy poked his head in from the living room. “Sir?”\n “Mrs. Zedman get here yet?”\n “\u0027Bout five minutes ago.”\n “Show her in.”\n Chadwick\u0027s hand closed into a fist. “You made Ann Zedman drive up here?”\n “Escorted her,” Prost corrected. “Strictly voluntary.”\n “She has enough to deal with.”\n “Why, Mr. Chadwick, I thought she\u0027d be concerned—father of her child, and all.”\n Chadwick shoved back his chair and rose to his feet. “You son of a—”\n Damarodas cleared his throat. “Been a long night, Mr. Chadwick. Let me walk you out.”\n Prost was about to add something when Ann came into the kitchen, her expression like a highway crash survivor\u0027s—one of the commuters in the fifty-car pile-ups on the Grapevine who go wandering through almond orchards in the fog.\n “Ann?” Chadwick said.\n There was a three-second delay before she focused on him. “I just—Two calls in a row. Mark Jasper, forced leave of absence from school. Then the detective here. John\u0027s blood . . . ?”\n “Don\u0027t do this now,” Chadwick told her. “I\u0027ll take you home. Get some sleep. Get a lawyer.”\n “No, no. That\u0027s not . . . I mean, that\u0027s not necessary, is it?”\n “No, ma\u0027am,” Prost said. “We have some coffee, if you\u0027d like.”\n Ann gazed blankly around the kitchen that used to be hers. “I haven\u0027t been in . . . so long. He changed the countertops.”\n Prost smiled sympathetically. “Have a seat, ma\u0027am. Mr. Chadwick, thanks for your time.”\n Chadwick didn\u0027t move. He needed to believe that Ann was unshakable. Even after Katherine died, after he\u0027d quit the school and given up all hope of having Ann in his life, he needed to know she was still at Laurel Heights, working with children, dreaming about the ideal school. As much despair as Chadwick had encountered working for Cold Springs, no matter how many terrible situations he\u0027d walked into, how much proof he accumulated that the American family was dying a slow and painful death, he needed to believe that Ann\u0027s optimism survived. Now her fragility paralyzed him and he saw that he had relied on her too much, been intoxicated by her faith too long, to believe that she could be broken.\n In the space of twenty-four hours, her life\u0027s work had been stolen from her. Her soul had spun off balance. If Detective Prost harbored the same suspicions Norma Reyes did, he\u0027d have Ann admitting to anything.\n “Let me stay with you,” he tried again. “You don\u0027t have to—”\n “It\u0027s all right,” she murmured, not looking at him. “You go on.”\n “Sound advice,” Prost agreed. “And by the way, Mr. Chadwick, just as a formality, I should tell you it\u0027d be a bad idea for you to leave the Bay Area for the next few days.”\n “I\u0027m flying to Texas in the morning. You know that.”\n “Yes, I do.” Prost smiled, as if nothing could\u0027ve suited him better. “I suppose I knew that.”\n Chadwick took a step toward the detective, but Damarodas\u0027 fingers closed around his arm like owl talons. “Right this way, Mr. Chadwick. Easy to get lost in a house this big.”\n Damarodas steered him past the evidence techs in the living room, into the front yard, past the police vehicles and the news vans to Chadwick\u0027s rental car, where Kindra Jones was sitting on the hood.\n When she\u0027d returned his page, Kindra had been waiting for him in a Montgomery Street coffeehouse, pissed off and impatient after three cups of house blend. Her mood hadn\u0027t improved when he\u0027d told her the situation, and that she\u0027d either need to wait for him there indefinitely or find a taxi to Marin. “I\u0027m charging the cab to Hunter,” she\u0027d said. “And you\u0027re explaining it to him. Goddamn, Chad, I said talk to the man.”\n As Damarodas and he neared the car, she slid to her feet. “This joker arresting you?”\n “This joker is not,” Damarodas said. “Miss—”\n Chadwick made the introductions, then suggested that Kindra start the car.\n “No. Uh-uh. I\u0027ve been waiting for you all night. Somebody\u0027s going to tell me what the hell is going on.”\n Chadwick filled her in the best he could. “Just so I know,” he told her, “what exactly did you say to the police?”\n “What did I say—” Kindra\u0027s eyes narrowed. “Oh, wait—they did not sucker you with that, did they? I didn\u0027t tell anybody jack shit, Chadwick. Police will fuck with your mind every time.”\n “That\u0027s a gross overgeneralization,” Damarodas commented.\n “Fuck you,” Kindra told him. “Fuck you, Sergeant, sir. Now if you\u0027ll excuse me, the car\u0027s starting to sound better.”\n She slammed the driver\u0027s side door behind her. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cold-springs/page-37.html","bookId":2423,"book":{"id":2423,"title":"Cold Springs","description":"Storyline: \n The death of a child ripples effects on all around her - whether accident, suicide, or murder.
