Don\u0027t let your dirty back touch my ropes!”\n Then he turned and yelled at Morrison, who was lagging behind.\n Morrison got in trouble almost as much as Mallory. Not because Morrison was a rebel, but because she was a weak fat slob who could never make the course. She\u0027d taken all the abuse the instructors could dish out, but every day she failed to get even halfway. They all had to wait for her while she tried repeatedly, and cried, until finally the instructors walked her through and punished the whole group for what she couldn\u0027t do.\n Mallory was grateful for her, though—grateful that there was another girl in the group. Grateful that Morrison sometimes took the instructors\u0027 abuse instead of her.\n Mallory\u0027s elbows felt like spikes going through her skin, pulling her along through the mud.\n “Move, Zedman!” another instructor yelled. Always a new voice—another anonymous demon with a pitchfork. “This is what you ran away for, isn\u0027t it? You\u0027re all grown up now! Take care of your own life!”\n Mallory clenched her teeth to keep from screaming obscenities.\n She got out from under the rope net and started the tire gauntlet.\n The two boys in her unit—Bridges and Smart—were already ahead of her. Smart was the kid with the spiky yellow hair, the one who\u0027d gotten his mouth taped for cussing the first day. Ever since then, the instructors had had a good time calling him Smart-Mouth, like that was some hysterical joke.\n Bridges was the fat kid with the bad acne, yet somehow he was always the first one under the ropes.\n Mallory didn\u0027t know their first names. She didn\u0027t care.\n Behind her, Leyland yelled, “Come on, Morrison!”\n Mallory could hear Morrison sobbing, which was predictable, like every other damn thing in this place. Every day—yelled awake, drilled to death, fed bread and water for breakfast. Then the damn counselors pulled them aside for the “program”—lectures nobody wanted to hear, followed by chances to talk nobody ever took. And then there would be the slave labor—building a new dorm for the next group of victims.\n What would Race think of this? Mallory tried to imagine him here. Race would fight the instructors, she decided. He would succeed where she failed.\n She slowed down on the tires. The new assistant instructor got in her ear, yelling at her to keep her knees up. Mallory didn\u0027t look at the guy, but she could tell it was one of the older kids—the ones they called white levels. No one would ever brainwash Mallory like that.\n She tried to keep her mind on Race. The guilt swelled up in her again—the knowledge that she had left him, didn\u0027t even know where he was staying now, or if the police had caught him.\n Everything had gone horribly wrong. Her mom finding the gun in the locker—somebody must\u0027ve told her to look, but Mallory couldn\u0027t figure out who. Then the argument with her mom, running away to Race, that nightmarish week at Talia\u0027s. The Halloween party, coming home and finding the body. Then afterward . . . hiding out with Race, holding him while he cried, making love in the stairwell of that abandoned apartment building.\n It had all been a mistake—even the sex.\n She understood now why they called it losing virginity. She had lost something of herself, and what had she gotten in return? She didn\u0027t even feel what she had wanted most—closer to Race.\n She tripped on the last tire, fell flat on her face. She turned over, wheezing, her eyes stinging with mud, and stared at the canopy of cypress branches above. The white level\u0027s face hovered over her, hollering at her to get up.\n She got to her feet, managed not to take a swing at the kid. She\u0027d tried that when—yesterday? She\u0027d popped some instructor in the eye and paid for it with four hours in solitary, locked in a lightless shed until she\u0027d started to see spots like jellyfish floating in the darkness.\n She jumped up to the balance beam—still thinking about Race, and Pérez\u0027s words. If it wasn\u0027t for those people, your dad would be okay. They keep a gun to his head.\n Mallory wasn\u0027t stupid. She\u0027d never met Race\u0027s older brother but she knew Samuel had supplied Katherine\u0027s drugs. She understood why her dad wouldn\u0027t like her hanging out with the Montroses. But still, the hate in his voice when he talked about them . . . it was way beyond fear for Mallory. It was murderous.\n And the idea that he was planning something, that the Montroses were keeping a gun to his head—what the hell did that mean?\n She\u0027d tried to talk to Race about it, but he\u0027d gotten really quiet.\n He admitted his brother had been a dealer, a real bad-ass. He told her how Samuel used to beat up his mother\u0027s boyfriends—grown men, twice his size. Samuel had made Race work as a spotter for cops on the street corner. The same year Mallory had been starting kindergarten, Race had been working the drug trade.\n But that was a long time ago, and Race had been adamant—Samuel wasn\u0027t in the picture anymore. He wouldn\u0027t say where Samuel had gone, but Mallory was pretty sure Race was telling her the truth—on that point, anyway.\n What bothered her, the more she thought about it, was something Race had told her after they\u0027d made love, when she\u0027d asked if there was any relative he could go to—anybody he trusted.\n He had propped himself up on his elbow, stared over her shoulder long enough for a BART train to blare past outside the grimy window. “Insanity runs in my family, Mal. There\u0027s nobody I trust. Nobody.”\n He opened his palm. His nails had cut deep crescents into his lifeline.\n Ever since that night, she\u0027d been thinking. Little things, like the fact that she\u0027d woken up the morning after Halloween, crashed on a couch in an abandoned house, and Race hadn\u0027t been there. He\u0027d come back soon enough, bringing donuts and beer for breakfast, but she had no idea how long he\u0027d been gone. And after that they\u0027d walked together to his mother\u0027s.\n That didn\u0027t mean he\u0027d killed Talia. Of course it didn\u0027t.\n But if the police questioned her, if they visited Cold Springs and pressured her the way the instructors did, told her it was her ass, or her boyfriend\u0027s—what would she say? Would she have the courage to lie? To be Race\u0027s alibi?\n She was falling behind on the course. She hit the parallel bars, arm-walked across, caught up with Smart and Bridges, who were throwing themselves uselessly at the wall.\n “Let\u0027s go!” Leyland bellowed. He\u0027d traded places with the white level—let the white level chew out Morrison for a while. “This is a little wall, Zedman. My grandmother trains on this wall. Get your sorry butt over the top. LET\u0027S GO!”\n Mallory knew the wall wasn\u0027t more than six feet high, but it felt a lot taller. She could get her fingertips to the top, but there was no way she had enough strength to pull herself up. She slammed into it anyway, grabbed the top, felt the blisters break on her hands from where she\u0027d done the same thing the day before. She ended up sprawled on the ground, staring at the gray cinder blocks. Her whole damn life came down to cinder blocks—sleeping in them, climbing them, building with them. The instructors would have her eating cinder blocks pretty soon.\n Smart and Bridges weren\u0027t having any more luck than Mallory. Smart wasn\u0027t strong enough. Bridges was too damn fat; he could get his meaty hands around the top, but then he\u0027d climb about two feet and hang there like a sandbag before falling on his butt.\n Mallory got up and tried again, hating the wall, wanting to bust it down.\n Morrison came up next to her, huffing and sobbing, and Mallory realized that nobody had walked her up this time. She\u0027d made it herself. Mallory didn\u0027t know why, but she liked that Morrison had beaten the bastards, shown them she could get this far.\n Mallory looked down at her raw hands. She was about to throw herself at the wall again, then she stopped.\n She remembered a time in second grade—Mrs. Sanford\u0027s class, Laurel Heights, the new kid Race huddled under the sand table because the boys had teased him about wearing the same shoes five days in a row, asking him if his mom had ever heard of Goodwill. And Mrs. Sanford not seeing any of it—blind to what was going on right under her nose, just like every teacher. Just like Mallory\u0027s mom.\n Mallory had scooted under the sand table with Race and apologized to him, even though she hadn\u0027t done anything. Right there, they\u0027d formed a friendship, writing their names for each other on the sandy cement. They\u0027d ganged up together and become the terrors of the class.\n “Hey,” she told Morrison. “Come on!”\n She laced her fingers together, made a foothold. Morrison looked at her like she was from Mars.\n Morrison had lost all traces of that heavy mascara she\u0027d worn on arrival, but her eyes were still swollen from constant crying. Her stringy hair had been dyed four different colors and was matted to her cheeks so it looked like several different animals had crawled on her head to die.\n “Don\u0027t mess with me, Zedman,” she muttered, but she didn\u0027t put any heart in it.\n The instructors were still yelling, but they weren\u0027t yelling specifically at Mallory or Morrison. Mallory felt as if she\u0027d suddenly created a bubble of neutral space, the drill sergeant crap flowing right around her.\n “I\u0027m serious,” she told Morrison. “Screw Leyland, okay? Come on!”\n Morrison hesitated, then, awkwardly, put her foot in Mallory\u0027s cupped hands. She almost fell trying to get her balance, but she got her hands on the top of the wall and held on. Mallory\u0027s raw blisters hurt like hell, but she kept her fingers laced together and stood, pushing Morrison\u0027s leg up. It was like trying to balance a barbell on one end, but Mallory kept pushing and suddenly Morrison was at the top, and then over the wall with a painful thump.\n Mallory had forgotten how good it felt to smile.\n Bridges and Smart were staring at her like they were sure she\u0027d just signed their death warrants.\n Leyland shouted, “Keep it moving, Zedman!”\n And Mallory heard something new in his tone—approval.\n That\u0027s what they wanted. They wanted team cooperation.\n Mallory was about to offer Smart a boost over the wall when a whistle blew two times—that sharp signal that meant “faces to the wall.” Black levels weren\u0027t supposed to see anyone but their own team. They weren\u0027t supposed to make eye contact with any visitor. Smart and Bridges turned so their noses were touching the cinder block.\n Morrison scrambled around from the other side of the wall to join them. Her whole left side was caked with mud, but she gave Mallory a strange look that made her feel they had a new understanding—an alliance.\n “Wall!” the white level screamed.\n Mallory made the mistake of glancing back before complying, and when she did she saw Dr. Hunter and his visitors.\n One was a young black woman. From her street clothes, and Hunter\u0027s body language, it was obvious she was getting a tour—maybe a parent, or a reporter. The other newcomer was the butch-looking blond woman who\u0027d been with Chadwick, the day they\u0027d picked up Mallory.\n What was her name—Owens? No. Olsen.\n She was dressed in white sweats. She joined the line of counselors at the end of the course.\n Then Mallory understood what she was doing here—she was going to replace Wilson, the guy Mallory had kicked in the balls. The realization was like a drink of acid.\n Leyland was yelling at her now, telling her to get her nose to the cinder block, but she didn\u0027t. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cold-springs/page-19.html","bookId":2423,"book":{"id":2423,"title":"Cold Springs","description":"Storyline: \n The death of a child ripples effects on all around her - whether accident, suicide, or murder.
