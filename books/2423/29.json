I wasn\u0027t even sure they liked apples.”\n A smile tugged at Mallory\u0027s lips. “I suppose I have to write that postcard now.”\n “After I brought you to see horses and didn\u0027t even freak out? You pretty much owe me, yeah.”\n “Why is it so important I write my mom?”\n “It\u0027s not important to me. It\u0027s important to you. The people in your life never go away, Mallory—not when you run, not when they hurt you. You have to find a connection with them that works. You have to start somewhere.”\n She brought out the postcard and the pen, offered them to Mallory.\n The horse sniffed to see if this was another offering of food, and then, disappointed that it wasn\u0027t, snorted into Mallory\u0027s hair.\n Mallory took the postcard, suddenly liking the idea of sending her mom something that had horse snot on it.\n She wrote, Dear Mom, I\u0027m fine. I\u0027m sorry for trying to hurt you.\n She signed her name and gave the card back to Olsen. Her hands only trembled a little. Olsen dabbed the raindrops off the card, then slipped it into her coat pocket.\n “So where was Race?” Olsen\u0027s question was as unobtrusive as the patter of rain on the grass. “If he wasn\u0027t with you, where was he?”\n “I told you, I was just talking. It\u0027s nothing.”\n Olsen crumpled the plastic bag and stuffed it in her pocket along with the postcard. “It\u0027s the fourth thing to master, Mallory, the last of Dr. Hunter\u0027s concepts. Trust.”\n “Yeah? What\u0027s the end of your story?”\n Olsen stared at her.\n “The thing with your stepdad,” Mallory said. “The lie you told your mom. That\u0027s got something to do with why you\u0027re counseling me, doesn\u0027t it? I remind you of something that happened to you.”\n Olsen\u0027s eyes were blue, but they reflected the blackening sky. “You\u0027d better get some sleep, now, kiddo. Big night tonight.”\n “Don\u0027t you mean big day tomorrow?”\n Olsen hesitated, and for a weird moment, Mallory thought she knew about her dreams, knew how Mallory sometimes woke in a cold sweat.\n “Just get some sleep. We\u0027ll talk again soon enough.”\n That night after rations, Mallory was allowed to build the fire.\n She set tinder around the brace, trying to keep it dry from the cold drizzle that was falling.\n She thought about Katherine, and wondered what she\u0027d be doing now if she were alive. Maybe Katherine would be here at Cold Springs, helping kids the way Olsen was.\n She got the fire to smolder, then flicker, then finally blaze.\n Mallory cracked a branch of mesquite that looked like a wishbone. She tossed the short end into the flames, stared at the red outline of the other piece, which now resembled a crutch.\n Accountability.\n Competence.\n Honesty.\n Trust.\n 14\n The man who opened John Zedman\u0027s door had a pencil goatee, the build of a middleweight, and a Mexican snake-and-eagle tattoo on his forearm. He reminded Chadwick of Norma\u0027s cousins in L.A.—the ones who threw hand grenades into empty police cars.\n “You must be Pérez,” Chadwick said. “I\u0027ve heard wonderful things.”\n “Don\u0027t take warnings real well, Mr. Chadwick, do you?”\n No hesitation. No confusion about who he was talking to. Pérez\u0027s eyes glowed like magnifying glass light on kindling.\n “This is Miss Jones, my partner,” Chadwick told him. “We want to speak with John.”\n “You carrying?”\n “We fly for a living,” Chadwick said. “Be a little hard to pack pistols.”\n Pérez produced a nine-millimeter from the back of his belt. “I don\u0027t have that problem. Come on in.”\n Chadwick glanced at Kindra. “Told you, you should\u0027ve waited in the car.”\n “After sitting on my butt an hour last time? Shit, Chad. Even this clown\u0027s more interesting.”\n “I\u0027m being hospitable,” Pérez warned. “So shut up and come in.”\n All traces of Ann had vanished from the house. No orchids in the windows, no kentia palm under the skylight. Her folk art no longer cluttered the coffee tables. The mantel was bare of photographs. Everything was stark white and black and decidedly John.\n Debussy on the stereo, postmodern paintings on the walls. The only sign Mallory had ever lived there was the old kindergarten quilt hanging by the fireplace, its glass frame cracked, a huge triangular shard missing at about the level of a man\u0027s fist.\n Pérez stopped Chadwick by the sofa and turned him around, made him open his overcoat. Then he studied Jones, who could\u0027ve concealed six or seven weapons in her baggy flannel and corduroy layers.\n “You ain\u0027t frisking me, Juan Valdéz,” she said. “Just get over it.”\n Apparently Pérez decided she wasn\u0027t worth the trouble.\n “Walk,” he said. “Mr. Z\u0027s on the back deck. Go straight—”\n “I remember,” Chadwick said.\n They went through the kitchen, Pérez flanking them, putting himself at just the right angle to maximize Chadwick\u0027s discomfort. His presence brought back combat instincts Chadwick hadn\u0027t used in years—memories of hand-to-hand training at Lackland, waiting for a baton strike from any angle, trying to widen his peripheral vision.\n “You want to not breathe on my cornrows?” Kindra told Pérez.\n John Zedman stood on the back porch, talking on his cell phone, the Pacific Ocean glittering behind him. The wind coming up from the headlands smelled of sea foam and wet redwood. He registered their presence and held out his fingers, as if to catch a baseball.\n “Yes,” he said into the phone. “Subdivided into twenty-acre lots. Correct.”\n It was noon, but John still wore pajama pants, a linen dress shirt open over a tank top. He paced, barefoot, across the wooden slats of the deck. A coffee cup sat on the railing next to a plate of Eggo\u0027s.\n His hair had thinned, gone gray at the temples. His face looked drawn, as if he\u0027d been fighting the flu. He\u0027d put on weight in the gut and his eyes were bloodshot. Chadwick had somehow anticipated that John would look better than he had in the early 1990s—that affluence would\u0027ve oiled him up like a machine. But each year seemed to have been leeched out of John from a painful incision in a vein.\n John hung up, punched some buttons on his cell phone, as if doing a calculation. He seemed in no hurry to speak.\n “Tell your doorman to put away his pea-shooter,” Chadwick said at last.\n “I don\u0027t think so,” John said. “Pérez has a pretty good sense of who\u0027s untrustworthy.”\n “Twenty-seven million stolen from Laurel Heights, John—from the fund you set up.”\n John set the phone down on the railing, picked up his coffee cup. “You\u0027ve got some fucking nerve coming here. Ann embezzles, and you complain to me.”\n “Stop playing games.”\n John held his hand toward Pérez, who stood motionless in the doorway. “Am I playing any games, Emilio?”\n “No, sir.”\n “There you are then. Emilio is the most humorless man I\u0027ve ever met. He would know if I was playing games.”\n “Have you seen Samuel Montrose?” Chadwick asked. “I mean, actually seen him?”\n John\u0027s reaction was immediate and negative—like a man with a severe food allergy. His face became blotchy. “Pérez—did you offer Chadwick any coffee? And Miss—”\n “Jones,” she said. “No. Your man was too busy showing off his little gun.”\n Chadwick kept his eyes on John. He wished Kindra had stayed in the car like he\u0027d asked. He wished Pérez would go inside. John was too stage-conscious with other people around. Chadwick would never get a straight answer this way.\n “How long has the blackmail been going on?” he asked.\n “No. We\u0027re not going to have this conversation.”\n “Your money has been putting Race Montrose through school. You arranged to buy Talia Montrose\u0027s house. Now you\u0027ve stolen Laurel Heights\u0027 capital campaign money. I don\u0027t think you did it just to get back at Ann, or get custody of Mallory. I think your blackmailer put you up to it. What did he promise you, John—that he\u0027d go away?”\n “I had about three minutes to give you, Chadwick. I\u0027m afraid you just used it all.”\n “I\u0027ll keep Mallory safe,” Chadwick said. “I promise that.”\n John laughed bitterly. “He can describe her day, Chadwick. He can tell me what she had for breakfast and where she slept and every punishment you put her through.”\n The deck swayed under Chadwick\u0027s feet. “Who said this? When?”\n “You meant a lot to me once. That\u0027s dead now. Get the fuck out of my house.”\n “Talk to me, John.”\n “Tell me one thing,” John said. “Straight to my face. Did you get any letters? Did Samuel contact you even once?”\n “No.”\n John looked away. “You should\u0027ve lied, Chadwick. You should\u0027ve told me yes.”\n “I can help you. I understand—”\n “You understand nothing. You ran, Chadwick. I stayed here. I\u0027ve had to deal with your shit as if it were mine. So don\u0027t tell me you understand. You don\u0027t have the first fucking clue.”\n “John, this is your daughter—”\n “My daughter, Chadwick. Yours is dead, remember? Yours is dead, and you don\u0027t get a second chance with mine.”\n Chadwick\u0027s body didn\u0027t belong to him anymore. His fingers gripped John\u0027s shirt, crumpling the fabric, lifting John as if forcing him to see Chadwick eye-to-eye.\n “Hey, Chad.” Jones\u0027 voice, a half octave higher than usual. “Um—somebody wants to break in.”\n Dimly Chadwick became aware of Pérez, the muzzle of his nine-millimeter an inch away from Chadwick\u0027s temple. Through the roar in his ears, he heard John say, “Emilio, back off.”\n Pérez lowered the gun.\n Chadwick set John down, let go of his shirt.\n He stepped back, the anger draining as quickly as it filled him, leaving him ashamed and hollow. “I don\u0027t want to be your enemy, John.”\n “You stole my wife, then my daughter, and you\u0027re not my enemy? Get the fuck out, Chadwick.”\n He turned and poured his coffee into the wind, the liquid curling like a brown silk shroud as it fell.\n After Chadwick left, John stood at the railing, staring at the half-eaten toaster waffle, at his own reflection in the yellow glaze of the Fiestaware plate.\n He looked like a plague victim.\n Worse. He reminded himself of his father in the last year of his life—slugging down gin at El\u0027s Tavern, bemoaning the wife who\u0027d left him and the son who\u0027d grown to fear him—until his liver had finally turned to clay.\n Men who don\u0027t let their anger out eventually get warped inside. John knew this. They get twisted. They drink, or fight, or seek even darker consolations.\n Chadwick had seemed larger, dangerous in a way John never would\u0027ve imagined before.\n He had always been so reserved. How could anybody be that way all the time? How could they not let their feelings break out somewhere?\n “Boss,” Pérez said.\n I don\u0027t want to be your enemy.\n “The money,” Pérez said. “You already sent the account numbers?” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cold-springs/page-29.html","bookId":2423,"book":{"id":2423,"title":"Cold Springs","description":"Storyline: \n The death of a child ripples effects on all around her - whether accident, suicide, or murder.
