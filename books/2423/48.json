{"id":77332,"no":48,"title":"Page 48","content":"Hunter and Leyland studied her, measuring her, waiting.\n Mallory\u0027s cheeks still burned from the dressing down they\u0027d given her. They had wasted no time reasserting their authority, yelling twelve hours of freedom right out of her head. They gave her no apology or chance to explain, nothing to eat, no time to rest. They made her change into her spare set of Black Level fatigues—still stiff, still smelling of her own sweat and campfire smoke. Then they force-marched her across the river, through icy water up to her knees, all the way back to base camp, the exact place where Pérez had started shooting. Now she stood at attention, her pants cuffs freezing to her ankles, the wind making her eyes water.\n It was crazy, pigheaded stubbornness for Hunter to bring her straight back to this clearing, as if nothing had happened, and offer her a solo hike the same day she\u0027d returned from running away.\n But she understood why he was doing it. Changing in the lodge, she\u0027d overheard bits and pieces of his conversation with Leyland—about the police, the FBI, her mother. She knew Hunter was trying to protect her—to keep her in the program. And she wanted that. She wanted it badly.\n She didn\u0027t even mind their drillmaster abuse. It was reassuring compared to running from Pérez, or being with Chadwick—feeling so afraid and angry she\u0027d almost confessed what she half remembered about the night Katherine died.\n She wasn\u0027t safe—not here, not anywhere. At least in the woods she felt as if she were being given charge of her own fate. Hunter\u0027s word—accountability. Mallory liked the fact that Hunter had jogged her out here before giving her the choice, too. It made it clear what he expected her to do.\n Footsteps crunched in the woods and Olsen appeared, jogging up the path from the main lodge, out of breath, a supply pack in her hands. No one acknowledged her, but Mallory could feel Hunter\u0027s disapproval radiating toward the counselor. Back at the lodge, he\u0027d said her name through gritted teeth, wondering where she was, why she was late, as if Mallory\u0027s return was an appointment they\u0027d planned for. Mallory realized they probably blamed Olsen for letting her get away in the first place—the chaos when Smart was shot, Olsen leaving her to tend him.\n Hunter kept his eyes on Mallory. “Well?”\n “I want to log the solo trip, sir.”\n Some of the tension in the air dissipated. Hunter nodded.\n “Miss Olsen,” he said. “Prep her and get her on the trail.”\n “Yes, sir.”\n Hunter and Leyland retreated toward the river.\n “At ease, Zedman.” Olsen forced a smile, but she looked like she hadn\u0027t slept any more than Mallory had. “We\u0027ve got a lot to do.”\n “How is Smart?” Mallory asked.\n The skin around Olsen\u0027s eyes tightened. “He\u0027ll be fine. His parents pulled him out. He\u0027s on his way back home to Iowa.”\n Mallory stared at the remnants of the shelter Leyland had built as a demo the night before. She told herself Smart\u0027s absence wasn\u0027t her fault. He wasn\u0027t her best friend, or even a friend at all. But the few weeks she\u0027d known him seemed as important as all the years she\u0027d been at Laurel Heights, and his absence hurt. After getting his mouth taped, getting his ridiculous torch hairdo shaved off, slogging through the obstacle course and the barracks-building and the ropes course—after all that, Smart had been whisked back home to goddamn Des Moines. He\u0027d gotten shot because of her, and she had run in the other direction.\n She wanted to cry. She hated the fact that she\u0027d gone outside the program, caused a part of it to unravel.\n “Come on,” Olsen told her gently. “I\u0027ve got a new piece of jewelry for you.”\n Olsen led her to the burned-out fire pit. She opened her pack, told Mallory to hold out her hand, then snapped a metal cuff around her wrist. The thing was dull gray, with a single, green blinking light the size of a pencil point. There was no visible latch, and it was too tight to slip off.\n “GPS locator,” Olsen told her.\n “In case I run away again,” Mallory guessed.\n “All the black levels wear them for the solo trip.” But Olsen\u0027s tone made it clear that the runaway factor had been discussed. Hunter\u0027s decision to send Mallory out hadn\u0027t taken so much trust, after all.\n “We\u0027ll track your position,” Olsen continued, “make sure you\u0027re moving in the right direction. But mostly this is in case of emergency—a broken leg, something you absolutely can\u0027t handle alone. If that happens, press the light. You\u0027ll need to use something pointed to do that—a stick, or your knife. The button will turn red, and Dr. Hunter will send somebody to extract you.”\n “Extract me,” Mallory said. “Fun.”\n “It would mean starting survival training over from scratch. Not graduating with your team. And it might take us up to half an hour to reach your position, so the button is no substitute for being careful.”\n Mallory pulled at the bracelet, already wishing she had a hacksaw, but Olsen didn\u0027t give her time to dwell on it.\n They started reviewing the basics of the solo trip—the first-aid pack, the emergency procedures. Mallory remembered it all. She knew how to use the snakebite kit, the epinephrine pen. She could dress a wound in her goddamn sleep. Her backpack would hold nothing but one ration bar, her med kit, and an ultralight Polarguard sleeping bag. She would be alone for twenty-four hours, heading east, directly away from the only public road, into the heart of Hunter\u0027s empty kingdom. She would cross the river once. And if she did everything right, sometime tomorrow mid-morning she would come across a small dirt access road used only by Cold Springs. That was her goal. Someone would be waiting to pick her up.\n It didn\u0027t sound all that difficult. It was hard to believe the high-and-mighty Survival Week had boiled down to just this—a lot of preparation for a single day and night alone.\n “Trust me,” Olsen said. “It\u0027s enough.”\n She offered one last item—Mallory\u0027s survival knife. Except it wasn\u0027t really Mallory\u0027s. It was new. Hers had been borrowed by Chadwick, buried in the side of a sniper.\n Mallory fingered the new blade. She remembered attacking Olsen—stabbing her in the shoulder with that stupid dinner knife she\u0027d found. That seemed like it had happened to a different person, long ago.\n She slid the hunting knife out of the sheath, pinched the clean new point. She balanced it, the way Leyland had taught her, then threw it at the nearest tree. It bit into the wood at a bad angle, like a loose tooth, and immediately fell out.\n “Knife-throwing is just for show,” Olsen promised. “You won\u0027t use it.”\n Mallory almost asked about Pérez. What if he came after her? What good would a blinking light and a knife do her then?\n Olsen seemed to misread her expression. “You still mad at me?”\n Mallory wasn\u0027t sure what surprised her more—the question, or the fact that Olsen truly seemed concerned to know the answer.\n She had been mad at Olsen, after that night at the ropes course. It seemed a stupid matter now—the torn strap on her harness.\n She had blamed Olsen for that.\n She had spent years blaming everyone for everything. Pérez. And Chadwick. And her parents. And Katherine—Katherine most of all.\n I had reasons, part of her argued.\n Her fears, her failures, her sorry excuse for a childhood—what if it was someone else\u0027s fault?\n A small hard feeling started building in her—like Hunter\u0027s voice, like his crazy, pigheaded stubbornness. It didn\u0027t matter whose fault it was. She had no choice but to accept it and go on. She had a goal—Gray Level—and it didn\u0027t matter if they shot at her friends or made her father disappear or tried to kill her. If she didn\u0027t make this final trip, Katherine won, and she lost.\n “I\u0027m not mad,” Mallory said softly. “Not anymore.”\n “That\u0027s good. I was worried about you, Mal. I\u0027m glad you\u0027re all right.”\n It sounded like cheap throwaway sympathy, the kind anybody could say, but Mallory could tell Olsen meant it. She remembered that tenuous thread of understanding that had seemed to link her to Olsen during counseling sessions—that closeness that she\u0027d been so afraid of.\n “Whatever happened?” Mallory asked. “I mean . . . about your stepdad?”\n Olsen stared at her for a moment, as if translating her question from a different language. “My stepdad?”\n “The story you were telling us. That day in counseling.”\n Olsen bent down and picked up Mallory\u0027s knife. She looked at the blade, picked a tuft of splinters off the tip. “When I searched for my stepdad, I found out he was in jail, Mallory. He got a new girlfriend when he left my mom, and he was in jail for molesting a young girl, his girlfriend\u0027s seven-year-old daughter.”\n Mallory blushed. In a way, she was sorry she had asked. But also, she was awed that Olsen would tell her. It wasn\u0027t the kind of thing you told someone . . . unless you really trusted her.\n “You didn\u0027t want to tell your mom that?” she asked.\n “No,” Olsen answered. “She would\u0027ve gotten mad at me, refused to believe it. People like my stepdad, they don\u0027t become that way overnight. They repeat their pattern. Over and over. I didn\u0027t want my mother to know.”\n “Because . . . Oh.”\n “Not me,” Olsen said. “Not me. But I have a little sister . . .”\n She paused, weighing the blade just as Mallory had. “I had a little sister about your age, Mallory.”\n Mallory was silent, thinking about the story, liking Olsen sharing it with her.\n “I need to tell you something,” Mallory said. “A dream I had.”\n Olsen examined the knife absently. “Oh?”\n Then Leyland\u0027s boots crunched in the leaves. “Time\u0027s wasting, counselor. Come on, Zedman—move! Long day ahead of you.”\n Hunter and Leyland were both standing over her. The moment for secrets was gone.\n Olsen rose, gave her one last look of encouragement. “I\u0027ll see you on the other side, kiddo.”\n She turned the knife handle-out, and offered it to Mallory. Her hand was trembling, and Mallory knew it was from anger.\n 31\n Ann Zedman didn\u0027t arrive on the noon plane from San Francisco.\n When she finally appeared in the airport terminal, a little after one, she walked up from the wrong direction—from the ground transportation exit, trailing a small overnight bag on wheels. Her caramel hair was swept back in a ponytail, no makeup. Denim jacket. Green T-shirt tucked into faded jeans. She might\u0027ve passed for a college student.\n She stopped a few feet away, took off her glasses and folded them into the pocket of her T-shirt.\n “I\u0027m sorry,” she said. “They sent me to the other terminal.”\n “The other terminal?”\n Her eyes were puffy, hay-fever red. “I told you the wrong airline. It took me a while to figure out what had happened. I\u0027m not thinking straight.”\n Chadwick had planned on being reserved when he saw her. He had prepared himself all the way into town, rehearsing how he would be. But he reached out his hand, and she took it, laced her fingers in his.\n He told her the news about Mallory—that she was safe, that Pérez had only meant to take her back to her father. He left out the parts where Pérez tried to kill him, and Chadwick released him without bringing him to the police. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cold-springs/page-48.html","bookId":2423,"book":{"id":2423,"title":"Cold Springs","description":"Storyline: \n The death of a child ripples effects on all around her - whether accident, suicide, or murder.
