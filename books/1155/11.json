{"id":11501,"no":11,"title":"X A FAMOUS KITCHEN BOY","content":"Geoffrey\u0027s window is a very fascinating place to be—possibly the most interesting window the world has ever seen. It is not just one lifetime which has found that window interesting, but more lifetimes than we can count comfortably. Sir Thomas Malory, who wrote his Morte d\u0027Arthur in 1469, fairly lived in that window; so did Shakespeare when he wrote \"King Lear\" in 1605, and even the modern poet, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, who wrote \"The Charge of the Light Brigade,\" composed a series of poems called \"Idylls of the King,\" which return for their sources through Malory to Geoffrey at his window. \\n\\n \\n\\n There is one story, however, which Geoffrey did not see as he looked out of his golden window—the story of the famous kitchen boy, or \"Gareth and Linet.\" This tale is found in Sir Thomas Malory\u0027s Morte d\u0027Arthur, which was not completed until 1469, many years after the writing [Pg 86]of Geoffrey\u0027s Chronicle in 1147. Clear and sunshiny is the English of this wonderful book of Malory\u0027s, and nowhere in the world can more beautiful, exciting, and marvelous stories be found than between the covers of the Morte d\u0027Arthur. The Morte d\u0027Arthur was written about twenty years after the invention of printing by Coster and Gutenberg. Sixteen years after the completion of the book by Malory, Caxton printed it in black letter in English. There is only one perfect copy of this book by Caxton, the first of the English printers, and that is in Brooklyn, New York. In the preface which Caxton wrote for the Morte d\u0027Arthur, he says that in this book will be found \"many joyous and pleasant histories, and noble and renowned acts of humanity, gentleness and chivalries.... Do after the good and leave the evil, and it shall bring you good fame and renown.\" Certainly that is what the kitchen boy did, and it brought him to good fame. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was one day when King Arthur was holding a Round Table court at Kynke Kenadonne by the sea. And they were at their meat, three hundred and fifty knights, when there came into the hall two men well clad and fine-looking. And, as the old story says, there leaned upon their shoulders \"the goodliest young man and the fairest that ever they all saw, and he was large and long and broad in the shoulders, and well visaged, and the fairest and the largest-handed that ever man saw, [Pg 87] \\n\\n but he fared as if he might not go or bear himself—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The two men supported the young man up to the high dais upon which Arthur was feasting. When the young man that was being helped forward was seen there was silence. Then the young man stretched up straight and besought Arthur that he would give him three gifts. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The first gift I will ask now,\" he said, \"but the other two gifts I will ask this day twelve months wheresoever you hold your high feast.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ask,\" replied Arthur, \"and you shall have your asking.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sir, this is my petition for this feast: that you will give me meat and drink enough for this twelvemonth, and at that day I will ask mine other two gifts.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My fair son,\" said Arthur, \"ask better. This is but simple asking.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But the young man would ask no more. And when the King, who had taken a great liking to him, asked him for his name, the young man said that he could not tell him. \\n\\n \\n\\n The King took him to Sir Kay, the steward, and charged him to give the young man the best of all the meats and drinks and to treat him as a lord\u0027s son. \\n\\n \\n\\n But Sir Kay was angry, and said: \"An he had come of gentlemen, he would have asked of you horse and armor, but such as he is, so he asketh.[Pg 89] And since he hath no name, I shall give him a name that shall be Beaumains, that is Fair-hands, and into the kitchen shall I bring him, and there he shall have fat brose every day, that he shall be as fat by the twelvemonth\u0027s end as a pork hog.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And Sir Kay scorned him and mocked at him. On hearing this both Sir Launcelot, the greatest of the Knights of the Round Table, and Sir Gawaine were wroth and bade Sir Kay leave his mocking. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I dare lay my head,\" said Sir Launcelot, \"he shall prove a man of great worship.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It may not be by no reason,\" replied Sir Kay, \"for as he is so hath he asked.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Beaumains, or Fair-hands, was put into the kitchen, and lay there nightly as the boys of the kitchen did. The old book says: \"He endured all that twelvemonth, and never displeased man nor child, but always he was meek and mild. But ever when he saw any jousting of knights, that would he see an he might.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Sir Launcelot gave him gold to spend, and clothes, and whenever the boy went where there were games or feats of strength he excelled in them all. \\n\\n \\n\\n But always Sir Kay would taunt him with these words spoken to others, \"How like you my boy of the kitchen?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And so Fair-hands, the kitchen boy, continued[Pg 90] in service for a year. At the close of the year came a lady to the court and told about her sister who was besieged in a castle by a tyrant who was called the Red Knight of the Red Laundes. But she would not tell her name, and therefore the King would not permit any of his knights to go with her to rescue her sister from the Red Knight, who was one of the worst knights in the world. \\n\\n \\n\\n But at the King\u0027s refusal, Beaumains, or Fair-hands, as he was called, spoke, \"Sir King, God thank you, I have been this twelvemonth in your kitchen, and have had my full sustenance, and now I will ask my two gifts that be behind.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ask, upon my peril,\" said the King. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sir, this shall be my two gifts: first, that you will permit me to go with this maiden that I may rescue her sister. And second, that Sir Launcelot shall ride after me and make me knight when I require it of him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And both these requests the King granted. But the maiden was angry because, she said, he had given her naught but his kitchen page. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then came one to Fair-hands and told him that his horse and armor were come for him. And there was a dwarf with everything that Beaumains needed, and all of it the richest and best it was possible for man to have. But though he was horsed and trapped in cloth of gold, he had neither shield nor spear. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 91] \\n\\n \\n\\n Then said Sir Kay openly before all, \"I will ride after my boy of the kitchen.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Just as Beaumains overtook the maiden, so did Sir Kay overtake his former kitchen page. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sir, know you not me?\" he demanded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yea,\" said Beaumains, \"I know you for an ungentle knight of the court. Therefore beware of me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Thereupon Sir Kay put his spear in the rest and ran straight upon him, and Beaumains came fast upon him with his sword in his hand. And Beaumains knocked the spear out of the knight\u0027s hand and Sir Kay fell down as he had been dead. Beaumains took Sir Kay\u0027s shield and spear and rode away upon his own horse. The dwarf took Sir Kay\u0027s horse. \\n\\n \\n\\n Just then along came Sir Launcelot, and Beaumains challenged him to a joust. And so they fought for the better part of an hour, rushing together like infuriated boars. And Sir Launcelot marveled at the young man\u0027s strength, for he fought more like a giant than like a knight. At last he said, \"Fight not so sore; your quarrel and mine is not so great but we may leave off.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Truly that is truth,\" said Beaumains, \"but it doth me good to feel your strength, and yet, my lord, I showed not the most I could do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Then Sir Launcelot confessed to Beaumains that he had much ado to save himself, and that Beaumains need fear no earthly knight. And[Pg 92] then Beaumains confessed to Sir Launcelot that he was the brother of Sir Gawaine and the youngest son of King Lot; that his mother, Dame Morgawse, was sister to King Arthur, and that his name was Gareth. \\n\\n \\n\\n After that Launcelot knighted Gareth, and Gareth rode on after the maiden whose sister was kept a prisoner by the Red Knight. \\n\\n \\n\\n When he overtook her she turned upon him and said: \"Get away from me, for thou smellest all of the kitchen. Thy clothes are dirty with grease and tallow. What art thou but a ladle-washer?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Damosel,\" replied Beaumains, \"say to me what you will, I will not go from you whatsoever you say, for I have undertaken to King Arthur for to achieve your adventure, and so shall I finish it to the end or I shall die therefor.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Then came a man thereby calling for help, for six thieves were after him. Even when Beaumains had slain all the six thieves and set the man free from his fears, then the maiden used him despicably, calling him kitchen boy and other shameful names. \\n\\n \\n\\n On the next day Beaumains slew two knights who would not allow him and the maiden to cross a great river. \\n\\n \\n\\n But all the maiden did was to taunt him. \"Alas,\" she said, \"that ever a kitchen page should have that fortune to destroy even two doughty[Pg 93] knights; but it was not rightly force, for the first knight stumbled and he was drowned in the water, and by mishap thou earnest up behind the last knight and thus happily slew him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Say what you will,\" said Beaumains, \"but with whomsoever I have ado withall, I trust to God to serve him or he depart.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Fie, fie, foul kitchen knave,\" answered the maiden, \"thou shalt see knights that shall abate thy boast.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And so she continued to scold him and would not rest therefrom. And they came to a black land, and there was a black hawthorn, and thereon hung a black banner, and on the other side there hung a black shield, and by it stood a black spear great and long, and a great black horse covered with silk, and a black stone fast by. \\n\\n \\n\\n And before the Knight of the Black Lands the maiden used Beaumains despicably, calling him kitchen knave and other such names. And the Black Knight and Beaumains came together for battle as if it had been thunder. After hard struggle Beaumains killed the Black Knight and rode on after the damosel. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Away, kitchen boy, out of the wind,\" she cried, \"for the smell of thy clothes grieves me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And so ever despitefully she used him. Yet he overcame the Green Knight, who was the brother of the Black Knight, and spared his life at the maiden\u0027s request. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 94] \\n\\n \\n\\n And it was after the vanquishing of the Green Knight that they saw a tower as white as any snow, and all around the castle it was double-diked. Over the tower gate there hung fifty shields of divers colors, and under that tower was a fair meadow. And the lord of the tower looked out of his window and beheld Beaumains, the maiden, and the dwarf coming. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"With that knight will I joust,\" called the lord of the tower, \"for I see that he is a knight errant.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And before the knight the maiden used him despitefully. \\n\\n \\n\\n And ever he replied, patiently, \"Damosel, you are uncourteous so to rebuke me, for meseemeth I have done you good service.\" Then did the heart of the maiden soften a little. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I marvel what manner of man you be,\" she said, \"for it may never be otherwise but that you come of a noble blood, for so shamefully did woman never rule a knight as I have done you, and ever courteously you have suffered me, and that comes never but of gentle blood.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Damosel,\" answered Beaumains, \"a knight may little do that may not suffer a damosel. And whether I be gentleman born or not, I let you wit, fair damosel, I have done you gentleman\u0027s service.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She begged him to forgive her, and this Beaumains did with all his heart. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 95] \\n\\n \\n\\n Then they met Sir Persant of Inde, who was dwelling only seven miles from the siege, and the maiden besought Beaumains to flee while there was yet time. But he refused. \\n\\n \\n\\n And when Sir Persant and Beaumains met they met with all that ever their horses might run, and broke their spears either into three pieces, and their horses rushed so together that both their horses fell dead to the earth. And they got off their horses and fought for more than two hours. And Beaumains spared his life only at the maiden\u0027s request. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then Beaumains told Sir Persant that his name was Sir Gareth. And the maiden said that hers was Linet, and that she was sister to Dame Lionesse, who was besieged. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then the dwarf took word to the lady who was besieged, and the others came on after. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How escaped he,\" said the lady, Dame Lionesse, \"from the brethren of Sir Persant?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Madam,\" said the dwarf, \"as a noble knight should.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah,\" said Dame Lionesse, \"commend me unto your gentle knight, and pray him to eat and drink and make him strong. Also pray him that he be of good heart and courage, for he shall meet with a knight who is neither of bounty, courtesy, nor gentleness; for he attendeth unto nothing but murder, and that is the cause I cannot praise him nor love him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 96] \\n\\n \\n\\n All that night Beaumains lay in an hermitage, and upon the morn he and the damosel Linet broke their fast and heard mass. Then took they their horses, and, riding through a fair forest, they came out upon a plain where there were many pavilions and tents and a castle and much smoke and a great noise. When they came near the siege Beaumains espied upon great trees goodly knights hanging by the neck, their shields about their necks with their swords, and gilt spurs upon their heels. There hung high forty knights. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What meanest this?\" said Sir Beaumains. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Fair sir, \"answered the damosel, \"these knights came hither to this siege to rescue my sister, Dame Lionesse, and when the Red Knight of the Red Lands had overcome them he put them to this shameful death.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Then rode they to the dikes, and saw them double-diked with full warlike walls; and there were lodged many great lords nigh the walls; and there was great noise of minstrelsy; and the sea beat upon the side of the walls, where there were many ships and mariners\u0027 noise. And also there was fast by a sycamore-tree, and there hung a horn, the greatest that ever they saw, of an elephant\u0027s bone. Therewith Beaumains spurred his horse straight to the sycamore-tree, and blew so eagerly the horn that all the siege and the castle rang thereof. And then there leaped out knights out of their tents and pavilions, and they within[Pg 97] the castle looked over the walls and out of windows. Then the Red Knight of the Red Lands armed him hastily, and two barons set on his spurs upon his heels, and all was blood red, his armor, spear, and shield. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sir,\" said the damosel Linet, \"look you be glad and light, for yonder is your deadly enemy, and at yonder window is my sister, Dame Lionesse.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Then Beaumains and the Red Knight put their spears in their rests, and came together with all their might, and either smote the other in the middle of their shields, that the surcingles and cruppers broke and fell to the earth both, and the two knights lay stunned upon the ground. But soon they got to their feet and drew their swords and ran together like two fierce lions. And then they fought until it was past noon, tracing, racing, and foining as two boars. Thus they endured until evensong time, and their armor was so hewn to pieces that men might see their naked sides. Then the Red Knight gave Beaumains a buffet upon the helm, so that he fell groveling to the earth. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then cried the maiden Linet on high: \"Oh, Sir Beaumains, where is thy courage? Alas! my sister beholdeth thee and she sobbeth and weepeth.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n When Beaumains heard this he lifted himself up with great effort and got upon his feet, and lightly he leaped to his sword and gripped it in his hand. And he smote so thick that he smote[Pg 98] the sword out of the Red Knight\u0027s hand. Sir Beaumains fell upon him and unlaced his helm to have slain him. But at the request of the lords he saved his life and made him yield him to the lady. \\n\\n \\n\\n And so it was that Beaumains, or Sir Gareth, as his real name was, came into the presence of his lady and won her love through his meekness and gentleness and courtesy and courage, as every true knight should win the love of his lady. \\n\\n \\n\\n So ends happily one of the charming stories of adventure and knighthood in one of the greatest Cycles of Romance the world has ever known. Indeed, in that Great Palace we have entered, and some of whose golden doors we have been opening, there is no door more loved by human beings than the one over which is written Romance, for boys and girls and their elders have always loved a romantic story, and always will. \\n\\n \\n\\n There are four great romantic stories in the Palace of English Literature. The first is King Arthur and the Round Table, which Geoffrey of Monmouth discovered for us by his golden window. The second great romance is the story of Charlemagne. This was in the twelfth century, and the most valiant story which grew out of the Charlemagne Cycle was that of Roland. Every one should know the story of Roland and his famous sword, Durendal. The third is the Life [Pg 99]of Alexander, which came to England from the east. And the fourth is the Siege of Troy, composed in the thirteenth century and written in Latin. \\n\\n \\n\\n It takes many, many stories to satisfy our love of Romance. As we pass through the golden door over which is written Romance, one whole wall is filled with the names of lesser romances forgotten long, long ago. But the stories which Sir Thomas Malory gave us in his Morte d\u0027Arthur, written in 1469, will never be forgotten as long as the English language is spoken. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n The End \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1696/49939.html","bookId":1155,"book":{"id":1155,"title":"Early English Hero Tales","description":"简介： The master-stories of English literature told for young readers.
