{"id":25687,"no":1,"title":"PROLOGUE","content":"A dark night on the banks of the Thames; the south-west wind, heavily charged with sleet, was blowing strongly, causing little waves to lap against the side of a punt moored by the bank. Its head-rope was tied round a weeping willow which had shed most of its leaves, and whose pendent boughs swayed and waved in the gusts, sending at times a shower of heavy drops upon a man leaning against its trunk. Beyond stretched a broad lawn with clumps of shrubs, and behind loomed the shadow of a mansion, but so faintly that it might have passed unnoticed in the darkness had it not been for some lights in the upper windows. At times the man changed his position, muttering impatiently as the water made its way down between his collar and neck and soaked through his clothes to the shoulders. \u0027I must have been waiting an hour!\u0027 he exclaimed at last. \u0027If she doesn\u0027t come soon I shall begin to think that something has prevented her getting out. It will be no joke to have to come again to-morrow night if it keeps on like this. It has been raining for the last three days without a stop, and looks as if it would keep on as much longer.\u0027 A few minutes later he started as he made out a figure in the darkness. It approached him, and stopped ten yards away. \u0027Are you there?\u0027 a female voice asked. \u0027Of course I am,\u0027 he replied, \u0027and a nice place it is to be waiting in for over an hour on such a night as this. Have you got it?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027That is all right. Well, chuck your bonnet down there, three or four feet from the edge of the water.\u0027 \u0027And my cloak? I have brought that and a shawl, as you told me.\u0027 \u0027No; give it to me. Now get into the boat, and we will shove off.\u0027 As soon as the woman had seated herself in the punt the man unfastened the head-rope and stepped in; then, taking a long pole in his hand, he let the boat drift down with the strong stream, keeping close to the bank. Where the lawn ended there was a clump of bushes overhanging the water. He caught hold of these, broke off two branches that dipped into the stream, then, hauling the punt a little farther in, he took the cloak the woman had handed to him and hitched it fast round a stump that projected an inch or two above the swollen stream. \u0027That will do the trick,\u0027 he said. \u0027They will find it there when the river falls.\u0027 Then he poled the boat out and let her drift again. \u0027You have brought another bonnet, I see, Polly.\u0027 \u0027You don\u0027t suppose I was going to be such a fool as to leave myself bareheaded on such a night as this,\u0027 she said sullenly. \u0027Well, there is no occasion to be bad-tempered; it has been a deal worse for me than it has for you, waiting an hour and a half there, besides being a good half-hour poling this tub up against the stream. I suppose it went off all right?\u0027 \u0027Yes, there was no difficulty about it. I kicked up a row and pretended to be drunk. Not too bad, or they would have turned me straight out of the house, but I was told I was to go the first thing in the morning. The rest was easy enough. I had only to slip down, get it, and be off, but I had to wait some time at the door. I opened it about an inch or two, and had to stand there listening until I was sure they were both asleep. I am sorry I ever did it. I had half a mind to chuck it up three or four times, but——\u0027 \u0027But you thought better of it, Polly. Well, you were perfectly right; fifty pounds down and a pound a week regular, that ain\u0027t so bad you know, especially as you were out of a place, and had no character to show.\u0027 \u0027But mind,\u0027 she said threateningly, \u0027no harm is to come to it. I don\u0027t know what your game is, but you promised me that, and if you break your word I will peach, as true as my name is Polly Green. I don\u0027t care what they do to me, but I will split on you and tell the whole business.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t you alarm yourself about nothing,\u0027 he said, good-temperedly. \u0027I know what my game is, and that is enough for you. Why, if I wanted to get rid of it and you too I have only to drive my heel through the side of this rotten old craft. I could swim to shore easily enough, but when they got the drags out to-morrow they would bring something up in them. Here is the end of the island.\u0027 A few pushes with the pole, and the punt glided in among several other craft lying at the strand opposite Isleworth Church. The man helped the woman with her burden ashore, and knotted the head-rope to that of the boat next to it. \u0027That is how it was tied when I borrowed it,\u0027 he said; \u0027her owner will never dream that she has been out to-night.\u0027 \u0027What next?\u0027 the woman asked. \u0027We have got to walk to Brentford. I have got a light trap waiting for me there. It is a little crib I use sometimes, and they gave me the key of the stable-door, so I can get the horse out and put him in the trap myself. I said I was starting early in the morning, and they won\u0027t know whether it is at two or five that I go out. I brought down a couple of rugs, so you will be able to keep pretty dry, and I have got a driving-coat for myself. We shall be down at Greenwich at that little crib you have taken by six o\u0027clock. You have got the key, I suppose?\u0027 \u0027Yes. The fire is laid, and we can have a cup of tea before you drive back. Then I shall turn in for a good long sleep.\u0027 An hour later they were driving rapidly towards London. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3176/87074.html","bookId":858,"book":{"id":858,"title":"Dorothy\u0027s Double","description":"简介： A dark night on the banks of the Thames; the south-west wind, heavily charged with sleet, was blowing strongly, causing little waves to lap against the side of a punt moored by the bank.
