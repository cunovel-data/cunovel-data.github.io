{"id":25691,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER IV","content":"Mr. Hawtrey\u0027s hope that a clue had been obtained was speedily dissipated, for the next letter was posted in the south of London, and the one after it at Brompton. It was clear that the man who sent them did not confine himself to one particular office, and that it would be useless to set a watch on that in Claymore Street, Chelsea. Edward Hampton coming in that afternoon, he relieved his mind by telling what had happened. \u0027It is a comfort to talk it over with some one, Ned. You were a police-officer for some time out in India, I think, and may be able to see your way through this business. Danvers has been very kind about it, but so far nothing has come of his suggestions.\u0027 \u0027My Indian police experience is not much to the point. I had a police district for a year, but my duties consisted principally in hunting down criminals. Have you told Lord Halliburn?\u0027 \u0027Yes; as soon as the second letter came I went to him; it was only right that he should know.\u0027 \u0027Certainly. How did he take it, Mr. Hawtrey? if I may ask.\u0027 \u0027He was naturally annoyed at it; though, of course, he agreed with me that it was simply a piece of malice. A detective, to whom Danvers had spoken, without mentioning any name, suggested that it might be the work of some woman who had a grudge against him, or felt herself aggrieved at his engagement. I mentioned this to him, and he assured me that, so far as he knew, there was no one who had any complaint against him, and that he had never had any entanglement of any kind.\u0027 \u0027It is a horribly annoying thing, Mr. Hawtrey, and I am sure Miss Hawtrey must feel it very much. I thought she was not looking quite herself when I met her at dinner the night before last. Still, there must be some way of getting to the bottom of it. If it is not the work of an enemy, either of Lord Halliburn or of your daughter, it may be the work of one who has an enmity against yourself—one who is striking at you through yours.\u0027 \u0027That is just possible, Ned; but beyond men I have sentenced on the bench I don\u0027t know of anyone who would put himself out of his way to annoy me. Assuredly this cannot be the work of any Lincolnshire rustic.\u0027 \u0027But you have certainly one enemy who is just the sort of man to conceive and carry out such a blackguard business as this—I mean that man who was impertinent to you on the racecourse, and whose history you told us that evening.\u0027 \u0027I had not thought of him. Yes, that suggestion is certainly a probable one. He is evidently deeply impressed with the sense of injury, though, Heaven knows, I did not have the slightest ill-feeling against him, but was driven to do what I did by his own courses, and especially by his father\u0027s earnest request that he should not succeed him. There is no doubt as to his malice, and there can be as little as to his unscrupulousness.\u0027 \u0027Danvers and I were both of opinion, Mr. Hawtrey, that by his tone and manner when he spoke to you about payment of debts, that he had already done you some injury or had some distinct plan in his head. At that time your daughter was not engaged to Lord Halliburn, and his ideas may have been vague ones until the public notice of the engagement met his eye, when he may have said to himself, \"This is my opportunity for taking my revenge, by annoying both father and daughter.\"\u0027 \u0027It is possible, Ned. I can hardly bring myself to think that the son of my old friend would be capable of such a dastardly action, but I admit that there is at least a motive in his case, and that I can see none in that of anyone else.\u0027 \u0027At any rate, Mr. Hawtrey, here is a clue worth following, and as I have nothing whatever to do, and my own time hangs rather heavily on my hands, I will, if you will allow me, undertake to follow it up.\u0027 \u0027But with no evidence against him, not a particle, what can you do, Ned?\u0027 \u0027My business will be to get evidence. The first thing is to find out where the fellow lives, and to have him watched and followed, and if possible, caught in the act of posting one of these letters.\u0027 \u0027Remember, Ned, I would above all things avoid publicity, for Dorothy\u0027s sake. Nothing is more hateful than for a girl to be talked about, and it is only as a last resource that I would bring a charge against him at the Police Court.\u0027 \u0027I can quite understand that, and will certainly call in no police to my aid until I have previously consulted you and received your sanction to do so. It will be easy enough to find him, for I should know him in an instant, and shall probably meet him at the first racecourse I go to. It is not as if I knew nothing of his habits.\u0027 For the next week Captain Hampton frequented every racecourse within a short distance of London, but without meeting the man he was looking for. Men of the same class were there in scores—some boisterous, some oily-mouthed, some unmitigated ruffians, others crafty rogues. Several times he accosted one of these men, and inquired if he had seen a betting man having the name of Marvel on his hat; each time the response was the same. \u0027I have not seen him here to-day. I know who you mean well enough, but he is not here. I can lay you the odds if you like. You would be safe with me.\u0027 Further inquiry elicited the conjecture that \u0027he might have gone up North, or to some other distant races.\u0027 \u0027There are two meetings pretty well every day,\u0027 one said, \u0027sometimes three, and a man cannot be at them all. What do you want him for? If it is to get money out of him, you won\u0027t find the job a very easy one, unless he has happened to strike on a vein of luck. You had much better take the odds from me.\u0027 Captain Hampton explained that his business was a private one, and altogether unconnected with betting. \u0027Well, if you will give me your name I will let him know that you want to see him, if I happen to run up against him. I should say that he will be at Reading next week.\u0027 But Captain Hampton said his name would be unknown to Marvel, and the bookmaker, after looking him over suspiciously, concluded that it was of no use wasting further time, and turning away set up a stentorian shout of \u0027Six to one, bar one.\u0027 Captain Hampton tried Reading, but was as unsuccessful here as in his previous attempts. \u0027Want Marvel?\u0027 one man he asked repeated. \u0027Well, I have not seen him here, and I haven\u0027t seen him for the last ten days; so I expect he has either gone down on a country tour, or he is ill, or he is so short of the dibs that he can\u0027t pay his fare down. He would be here if he could; for he would manage to make enough money to pay his expenses, anyhow. It is hard when a man cannot do that.\u0027 Captain Hampton was not to be baffled, and after examining a sporting paper took a ticket early next morning for the North. He was away a week, and returned home disheartened. He had not seen the man nor did any of those he had questioned know the name of Marvel. \u0027It is like enough I may know the man,\u0027 one said confidentially, \u0027but I don\u0027t know the name; names don\u0027t go for much in the outside ring. A man is Marvel one day, and if when the racing is over he cannot pay his bets and has to go off quiet, he alters the cut of his hair next time and puts a fresh name on his hat, and is ready to take his davy, if questioned, that he was not near the course, and never heard the name of Marvel; and as he is sure to have some one with him to back him up and swear that he was with him at the other side of England on that day, the chap as wants his money concludes that he may as well drop it.\u0027 The day after his return Ned Hampton went to Epsom and there recognised with a start of satisfaction the man of whom he was in search. He had no name in his hat, and was talking to two or three men of his own class, one of whom he recognised as the man who had offered to tell Marvel that he wished to see him. He moved up in the crowd, and placed himself close to the men, but with his back towards them. Marvel was speaking. \u0027But what sort of fellow was he?\u0027 \u0027A military-looking swell.\u0027 \u0027And he said I should not know his name? I should know it sharp enough if it was down in my book without a pencil mark through the bet. There are people, you know, who, quite accidentally of course, I haven\u0027t settled up with.\u0027 There was a laugh among the group. \u0027A good many I should fancy, Jacob, but I don\u0027t think this chap could have been one of them. A man who has been left in the lurch generally takes it out in strong language. If this chap had wanted you for a tenner and you had not forked over, he would probably have spoken of you as a swindling scoundrel and said that if he met you he would take it out of you in another way if he could not get the money. Now he didn\u0027t seem put out at all; he wanted to see you about something or other, but I don\u0027t think it was anything to do with money. I can always tell when there is anything wrong about that. A man may put it as mild as he likes, but there is something in it that says he is nasty.\u0027 \u0027Well, I don\u0027t want to see him whoever he is,\u0027 Marvel said, \u0027so if he comes across any of you again tell him you hear I\u0027ve retired, or that I have drowned myself, or anything else you like, but that anyhow I ain\u0027t likely to be on any of the courses again this season. And mind, you don\u0027t know anything about where I live or where he is likely to get any news of me.\u0027 \u0027But where have you been the last fortnight, Jacob?\u0027 \u0027I have been on another job altogether, and if it turns out well you ain\u0027t likely to see much more of me here. I have had about enough of it.\u0027 As he found that he was not likely to hear more, Hampton moved away in the crowd, but continued to keep Marvel in sight. In two or three minutes the man separated from his companions, moved off the course, and stood for a minute or two with his hands in his pockets, meditating. Then his mind was made up. He pushed his way through the crowd, crossed the course, and walked quickly towards one of the entrances. Captain Hampton followed him closely, and was by no means surprised to see him walk to the station. \u0027He is evidently nervous about what they have told him,\u0027 he said to himself, \u0027and although he cannot tell what my business with him may be, he is determined to avoid me. All the better; I should have had great difficulty in keeping my eye on him in the crowd later on, and now I won\u0027t lose sight of him again.\u0027 Entering the station, the man waited until a train came up and then took his place in a third class carriage. Hampton entered the next compartment, but, to his great annoyance, found on arriving at Waterloo that Marvel was not in the carriage. \u0027Confound it,\u0027 he muttered angrily, \u0027he must have slipped out at one of the other stations without my noticing him. It must have been at Vauxhall, just as those four men were pushing past me to get out. I am a nice sort of fellow to take up the amateur detective business. To hunt for a man for nearly three weeks and then when I have found him to lose him again like this. I will go across and see Danvers. Of course he will have the laugh against me. Well, I can\u0027t help that; I will take his advice about it. I am evidently not fit to manage by myself.\u0027 Danvers had just returned from the Courts when Captain Hampton reached the chambers. \u0027Hullo, Hampton, where do you spring from? Everyone has missed you from your accustomed haunts. Some said you had eloped with an heiress; others that you are wanted for forgery. I met the Hawtreys last night at dinner. They both asked me after you. The young lady quite seemed to take your disappearance to heart. The more so, I think, because she had sent down a servant with a note to your lodgings, and the girl had learnt from your landlady that you had been away for a week. Of course, I could not enlighten her. Her father took me apart and asked me quite seriously about you. He seemed to think that you had been trying to ferret out something about this confounded letter business. He told me he had talked it over with you, regarding you as almost one of the family.\u0027 \u0027That is just what I have been about, Danvers, and I have made an amazing ass of myself.\u0027 \u0027You don\u0027t mean to say that!\u0027 Danvers exclaimed in affected surprise. \u0027Well, I know you used to do it at school sometimes, but I hoped that you had got out of the habit.\u0027 \u0027Bosh!\u0027 Hampton laughed. \u0027But I own I have done it this time. You remember that fellow on the racecourse?\u0027 \u0027You mean at the Oaks. Of course I remember him.\u0027 \u0027Well, it struck me that he might be the man who had sent the letters. He had, as Hawtrey told us in the evening, a bitter grudge against him, and such a dirty trick as this was just the sort of thing that a disreputable broken-down knave like him might concoct to gratify his malice.\u0027 \u0027You are right there; I wonder the idea did not occur to me. Well, I retract what I said just now; so far you have told me nothing to justify the epithet you bestowed on yourself.\u0027 \u0027My first idea,\u0027 Hampton went on, without noticing the interruption, \u0027was that as I had nothing particular to do I would go down to some of the races near town where I felt certain I should find him, follow the fellow back, and track him to his home. Then I had intended to come to you and ask your advice as to the next step to be taken.\u0027 \u0027There you showed your sagacity again, Hampton. Well, what came of it?\u0027 \u0027I went for a fortnight to every racecourse near town and asked after Marvel from bookmakers of his stamp. They all seemed rather surprised at his absence, and suggested that perhaps having failed to pay up here he had gone to one of the country meetings up in the North. I was up in Yorkshire for a week but with no better result. I came up last night and went to Epsom this morning and there spotted my man.\u0027 He then related the conversation he had overheard and the manner in which he had allowed the man to slip through his fingers. Danvers could not help laughing, though he, too, was vexed. \u0027I can quite understand your missing him at Vauxhall, Hampton. Of course it is easy to be wise after the event. It would not have done for you to have got in the same compartment with him at Epsom. You don\u0027t look like a third-class passenger, and the idea that you were the military swell who had been enquiring after him would probably have occurred to him; but if you had got out at a station or two further on, and then taken your place in his carriage, that idea would hardly have entered his mind.\u0027 \u0027Well, the result is I have thrown away three weeks of my leave in taking a lot of trouble and we are no nearer than we were before.\u0027 \u0027Not much, except that we have learnt that the man is engaged on a different matter, in which he intends to make money, and also that there is but little probability of his being met with again for some time on a racecourse. Of course, this business may be altogether unconnected with that of the Hawtreys, but on the other hand it may be. I am afraid there is little clue left for us to follow up. Getting out at Vauxhall might mean that he lived in that neighbourhood, or at Camberwell, or Peckham, or Kennington, or anywhere about there; or he might have crossed the river, and there is all the region between Chelsea and Westminster to choose from. If we knew that he went under the name of Marvel something might be done, but it is a hundred to one against that being the name he goes by in his domestic circle. If you have come to me for advice I can give you none; I can see nothing whatever to do but to wait for new developments. Have you seen the \"Liar\" this week?\u0027 \u0027No; I never look at it.\u0027 \u0027Well, you see there is a nasty paragraph there that unmistakably alludes to the affair. I have no doubt it is Halliburn\u0027s doing; he got so annoyed at these letters keeping on coming—and indeed it seems that some have been sent to him with \u0027Look before you leap,\u0027 \u0027Be sure that all is right before it is too late,\u0027 and things of that sort—that he went off to Scotland Yard, kicked up a row there, showed the envelopes he had received to the authorities, and gave them the whole history about the others. Of course, they promised that they would do what they could, and equally of course they will be able to do nothing. Well, I suppose some understrapper there got to hear of it, and probably sold the thing to one of the men who gather up garbage for the \"Liar.\" I have got the paper. There, that is the paragraph: \"There is a possibility that a marriage that has been arranged in high life may not come off after all. The noble lord who was to figure as bridegroom has received the unpleasant information that the young lady has been pestered with demands for money in exchange for compromising letters, and has himself received missives calculated to make one in his position extremely uncomfortable. Further developments may be looked for.\"\u0027 \u0027It is scandalous,\u0027 Captain Hampton exclaimed passionately, \u0027that a blackguard rag like this is allowed to exist!\u0027 \u0027Quite so, Hampton; I agree with you most heartily. Still, there it is, and others like it, and we have got to put up with it. If it had not been for that fool, Halliburn, taking things into his hands this notice would never have got in. One of Hawtrey\u0027s servants came round in a cab to fetch me this morning. I found him foaming with rage, talking about horsewhipping and all sorts of things. It is curious how that sort of thing still lingers in the minds of country squires. I told him, of course, that would make it ten times worse. Then he talked of an action, and I said, \"Now, my dear Mr. Hawtrey, you are getting altogether beyond my province. As a friend I am very glad to give you my advice as long as it is merely a question of endeavouring to find out the authors of these libels. Now it has assumed an altogether different phase, and you must go to your lawyer for advice. I am sure that he will tell you that you can do nothing, especially as in point of fact the statements are perfectly true. Still, there is no saying how far the thing will go, and whether it may not be necessary eventually to take legal steps; therefore it is only fair to your solicitor that you should put him in possession of the whole circumstances as far as they have gone.\" \u0027\"Very well,\" he said, \"I will go down at once to Harper and Hawes, and take their advice about it.\"\u0027 \u0027There is one comfort,\u0027 Captain Hampton said; \u0027there are not many people who will understand to whom this paragraph relates. I suppose there have been a dozen lords of one sort and another who have become engaged during the season, so that, except for us who are behind the scenes, there is nothing to point distinctly to the identity of the parties.\u0027 \u0027You need not count on that,\u0027 Danvers said shortly. \u0027This paragraph is merely intended to whet the curiosity of the public. You will see that next week there will be another, saying that they are now able to state, beyond fear of contradiction, that the nobleman and young lady who have been persecuted by anonymous letters are Lord Halliburn and Miss Hawtrey.\u0027 \u0027This sort of thing makes one regret that duelling has gone out of fashion,\u0027 Captain Hampton said savagely. \u0027There is nothing would give me greater pleasure than to parade the editor of that blackguard paper at six o\u0027clock to-morrow morning on Wimbledon Common!\u0027 \u0027It would no doubt be a pleasure to you, my dear Hampton,\u0027 Danvers said tranquilly, \u0027and the result might be a matter of unmingled satisfaction to all decent people; but, you see, it cannot be done. If it could have been he would have been shot years ago, noxious beast that he is. It being impossible, let us change the subject. What are you going to do this evening?\u0027 \u0027I am going to have dinner first.\u0027 \u0027It is only six o\u0027clock, my dear fellow.\u0027 \u0027All the better. I want to get it over, so as to go round and catch the Hawtreys before they go out—that is to say, if they are going to a ball or anything of that sort, and not to a dinner; Mr. Hawtrey knows I have been doing what I could to find out this betting fellow, but has not mentioned it to his daughter, for the same reason, probably, that I have taken pains to avoid meeting them since I began the search. At any rate, I should not like her to think that I have been away for this three weeks on my own pleasure, in perfect indifference to the unpleasant position in which she is placed, so I shall go to report progress—or, rather, want of progress—and to assure them that I will continue the search until I have run this fellow to earth.\u0027 Danvers looked at his friend through his half-closed eyes with a gleam of quiet amusement. \u0027The Indian sun does not seem to have cooled the enthusiasm of your youth, Hampton. You used to throw yourself then like a young demon into the middle of a football scrimmage, and rowed stroke in that four of yours till you rowed your crew to a standstill, and then tugged away all to yourself, till they got their wind again. To us, jaded men——\u0027 \u0027Shut up, man!\u0027 Hampton said hotly, \u0027this is no joking matter. Here is the honour and happiness of a girl who, when she was a little child, was very dear to me\u0027—Danvers\u0027 eyes twinkled momentarily—\u0027and I should be a brute if I did not do everything I could to put the matter straight; and I am quite sure,\u0027 he went on more quietly, \u0027that although, of course, they are not such friends of yours as they are of mine, you would spare no trouble yourself if you only saw any way in which you could be of real assistance.\u0027 \u0027Perhaps so, old man, perhaps so; but I should not get into fever heat about it. You see, the matter at present principally concerns Halliburn. It is his business and privilege to stand first in the line of defence of the character of the young lady to whom he is engaged.\u0027 \u0027And a nice mess he has made of his first move,\u0027 Captain Hampton agreed, pointing to the copy of the \u0027Liar.\u0027 \u0027Well, I won\u0027t wait any longer; they dine at seven o\u0027clock when they are alone, and I will go round at eight on the chance of finding them in.\u0027 Danvers sat looking at the empty grate for some minutes after he had left. \u0027It is about even betting, I should say,\u0027 he muttered to himself, \u0027and I think, if anything, the odds are slightly on Hampton, though he has not the slightest idea at present that he has entered for the race. The other one has got the start, but Hampton always had no end of last, and he will take every fence well, and it seems to me there are likely to be some awkward ones. Besides, I am not half sure that the other fellow will run straight when the pinch comes.\u0027 When Captain Hampton presented himself at the house in Chester Square, he found, to his satisfaction, that Mr. Hawtrey and his daughter were at home. \u0027They have just finished dinner, sir,\u0027 the servant said; \u0027dessert is on the table.\u0027 \u0027Then I will go in,\u0027 Captain Hampton said, and, opening the dining-room door, walked in. \u0027I am presuming on my old footing to enter unceremoniously, Mr. Hawtrey,\u0027 he said. \u0027I am glad to see you. You are heartily welcome, Ned. This reminds one of old times indeed.\u0027 Dorothy\u0027s welcome was sensibly cooler, while Mrs. Daintree, who had from the first set herself strongly against his intimacy at the house, was absolutely frigid. Ned saw that Dorothy\u0027s colour had perceptibly paled since he last saw her, and that she looked harassed and anxious. \u0027It is three weeks since I saw you,\u0027 he said. \u0027Is it?\u0027 she asked with an air of indifference. He laughed outright. \u0027That was really very well done, Dorothy, and I quite understand what it means. You think I have been neglecting you altogether, and amusing myself while you were in trouble; and were that the case I should deserve all the snubbing, and more, that you could give me. I believe that your father has not told you what I have been doing, and I do not wish to enter into details now,\u0027 and he glanced towards Mrs. Daintree, \u0027but I feel that I must, in justice to myself, assure you that the whole of my time has been occupied in the matter, and that although I have no success to boast of, I have, at least, tried my very best to deserve it.\u0027 \u0027That is good of you, Ned,\u0027 the girl said brightly. \u0027I have been feeling a little hurt at your desertion, and thought it did not seem like you to leave me in trouble. I always used to rely upon you when I got into a scrape. I don\u0027t want to know what you have been doing, though father can tell me if he likes, but I am quite content to take your word for it. Now I must go; it is time for us to dress. I wish I could stay at home and have a quiet evening, but you see I am no longer quite my own mistress.\u0027 \u0027Well, Hampton, what have you been doing, and why have you not been to see me before? I heard you were in town—at least, I heard so ten days ago.\u0027 \u0027I should have come, sir, before, had I had anything to tell you. I have nothing much now, and in fact have to-day bungled matters considerably; still, I shall start on a fresh search to-morrow, and hope to be luckier than I have been so far.\u0027 He then gave a detailed account of his visits to racecourses, of his meeting with Truscott that morning, of the conversation he had overheard, and of the manner in which the man had eluded him. \u0027Well, Ned, you certainly have deserved success, and I am indeed obliged to you for the immense trouble you have taken over the matter. It is too bad your spending your time over this annoying affair, when you are only home on a year\u0027s leave. What you have learned is, of course, no direct proof that Truscott has a hand in this affair; at the same time, what he said confirms to some extent your suspicions of him. Would it not be as well to put the search for him into the hands of a detective, now that there is some one definite to search for? One of these men might be useful, and I really would vastly rather employ one than know that you are spending day after day searching for him yourself. These men are accustomed to the work; they know exactly the persons to whom to apply; they have agents under them, who know infinitely better the sort of place where such a fellow would be likely to take up his quarters than you can do.\u0027 \u0027No doubt that is so,\u0027 Captain Hampton admitted reluctantly. \u0027I should have liked to have run him down myself, now that I have hunted him so long. Still, that is a matter of no importance, the great thing is to lose no time. I will get Danvers to give me a note to the man he spoke to first.\u0027 \u0027On my behalf, remember, Ned; he must be engaged on my behalf.\u0027 \u0027Very well, sir, if you wish it so; but I would rather that you and I arrange with him direct, and that it is not done by your solicitors. Danvers told me that you were going to them this morning about that infamous paragraph in the \"Liar.\"\u0027 \u0027Certainly they shall have nothing to do with it,\u0027 Mr. Hawtrey said hotly; \u0027I was a fool to go to them at all; I might as well have gone to two old women. They have been lawyers to our family for I don\u0027t know how many years, and are no doubt excellent men in their capacity of family lawyers, but this matter is altogether out of their line. They looked at each other like two helpless fools when I told them the story, and said at once that they would not undertake to advise me, but that I had better go to Levine, or one of the other men who are always engaged in these what they call delicate cases, that is to say, hideous scandals. However, I have made up my mind to keep clear of them all as far as I can; but, of course, I must be guided to some extent by Halliburn\u0027s opinion, or rather his wishes. As to his opinion, I have no confidence in it one way or the other. I\u0027m glad you did not say anything about what you had been doing before my cousin; she is worrying herself almost into a fever about it, the more so because there is no one to whom she can talk about it. She means well, but were it not that just at present it is absolutely necessary that Dorothy should show herself everywhere with a perfectly unconcerned air, I would make some excuse to send Mrs. Daintree down to the country again; as it is, I must keep her as a chaperon, but she is very trying I assure you, and I believe would come into my study to cry over the affair half-a-dozen times a day, if I would but let her. Now, Ned, you must excuse me, the carriage will be round in a few minutes, and as, with one thing and another, I got back too late to dress for dinner, I have not another minute to spare. Shall I give you a note authorising you to arrange with the detective?\u0027 \u0027There is no occasion for that; I shall speak in your name, and as he will want to have an interview with you before long, you can then confirm any arrangement I have made as to his remuneration.\u0027 Hampton called in on Danvers in the morning for the address of the detective, Slippen, and a card of introduction. The address was in Clifford\u0027s Inn, and on finding the number Hampton saw the name over a door on the ground floor. A sharp looking boy was sitting on a high stool swinging his legs. He evidently thought that amusement somewhat monotonous and was glad of a change, for he jumped down with alacrity. \u0027The governor is in, sir, but he has got a party in with him. I will take your card in. I expect he will be glad to get rid of her, for she has been sobbing and crying in there awful.\u0027 \u0027I am in no particular hurry,\u0027 Captain Hampton said, amused at the boy\u0027s confidential manner. \u0027Divorce, I expect,\u0027 the lad went on, as Captain Hampton took a seat on the only chair in the dark little office. \u0027I allus notice that the first time they comes they usually goes on like that. After a time or two they takes it more business-like. They comes in brisk, and says, \"Is Mr. Slippen in?\" just the same as if they was asking for a cup of tea. When they goes out sometimes they look sour, and I knows then that he,\u0027 and he jerked his thumb towards the inner office, \u0027hasn\u0027t any news to tell \u0027em; sometimes they goes out looking red in the face and in a regular paddy, and you can see by the way they grips their umbrellas they would like to give it to some one.\u0027 \u0027You must find it dull sitting here all day. I suppose you haven\u0027t much writing to do?\u0027 \u0027I doesn\u0027t sit here much. I am mostly about. There ain\u0027t many as comes here of a day, and he can hear the knocker. Those as does come calls mostly in the morning, from ten to eleven. There, she is a-moving.\u0027 The inner door opened, and a stout woman came out looking flushed and angry; the boy slid off his stool and opened the door for her, and then took Captain Hampton\u0027s card in. A moment later Mr. Slippen himself appeared at the door. \u0027Will you walk in, Captain Hampton? I am sorry to have kept you waiting. I rather expected,\u0027 he said, as he closed the door behind him, \u0027that I should have a call, either from Mr. Danvers or some one from him, when I saw that paragraph in the \"Liar.\" I made sure it was the case he was speaking to me about, and I said to myself, \"They are safe to be doing something now.\"\u0027 \u0027Yes, it is that case that I come about. I am here on the part of Mr. Hawtrey, the father of the young lady. I am an intimate friend of the family. Mr. Danvers gave you the heads of the matter.\u0027 The detective nodded; he was a rather short, slightly-built man, with hair cut very short and standing up aggressively; his eyes were widely opened, with a sharp, quick movement as they glanced from one point to another, but the general expression of the face was pleasant and good-tempered. \u0027He told you my opinion so far as I could form it from the very slight data he gave me?\u0027 \u0027Yes, you thought at first that the writer of the threats really had possession of compromising letters; but upon hearing that she was engaged you thought it likely that the letters might be the work of some aggrieved or disappointed woman.\u0027 \u0027That is it, sir.\u0027 \u0027So far as we can see,\u0027 Captain Hampton went on, \u0027neither view was correct; certainly the first was not. We have, as we think, laid our fingers on the writer, who is a man who believes himself to have a personal grievance against Mr. Hawtrey himself.\u0027 He then related the whole story. \u0027He may be the man,\u0027 Mr. Slippen said, when he had finished. \u0027At any rate there is something to go on, which there was not before. There will be no great difficulty in laying one\u0027s hand on him, but at present we have not a shred of real evidence—nothing that a magistrate would listen to.\u0027 \u0027We quite see that. Still, it will be something to find him; then we can have him watched, and, if possible, caught in the act of posting the letters.\u0027 \u0027You will find that difficult—I do not mean the watching him nor seeing him post his letters, but bringing it home to him. I would rather have to deal with anything than with a matter where you have got the Post Office people to get round. Once a letter is in a box it is their property until it is handed over to the person it is directed to. Still, we may get over that, somehow. The first thing, I take it, is to find the man. You say his betting name is Marvel?\u0027 \u0027That is the name he had on his hat at Epsom on the Oaks day, but he may have a dozen others.\u0027 \u0027Ah, that is true enough. Still, no doubt he has used it often enough for others to know him by it; and now for his description. \u0027Thank you, that will be sufficient. I think I will send a man down to Windsor at once; the races are on again to-day. He will get his address out of one or other of his pals. It will cost a five-pound note at the outside. If you will give me your address, I shall most likely be able to let you have it this evening.\u0027 \u0027I wish to goodness I had come to you before,\u0027 Captain Hampton said. \u0027Here I have been wasting three weeks trying to find the man, and spending fifty or sixty pounds in railway fares, stand tickets and expenses, and you are able to undertake it at once.\u0027 \u0027It is a very simple matter, Captain Hampton. I have been engaged in two or three turf cases, and one of my men knows a lot of the hangers-on at racecourses. Watches and other valuables are constantly stolen there, and as often enough these things are gifts, and are valued beyond their mere cost in money, their owners come to us to try if we can get them back for them, which we are able to do three times out of four. Whoever may steal the things, they are likely to get into one of four or five hands, and as soon as we let it be known that we are ready to pay a fair price for their return and no questions asked, it is not long before they are brought here. I don\u0027t say I may be able to find out this man\u0027s exact address, but I can find out the public-house or other place where he is generally to be met with. I don\u0027t suppose the actual address of one in ten of these fellows is known to others. They are to be heard of in certain public-houses, but even their closest pals often don\u0027t know where they live. Sometimes, no doubt, it is in some miserable den where they would be ashamed to meet anyone. Sometimes there may be a wife and family in the case, and they don\u0027t want men coming there. Sometimes it may be just another way. Many of these fellows at home are quiet, respectable sort of chaps, living at some little place where none of their neighbours, and perhaps not even their wives, know that they have anything to do with racing, but take them for clerks or warehousemen, or something in the city. So I don\u0027t promise to find out the fellow\u0027s home, only the place where a letter will find him, or where he goes to meet his pals, and perhaps do a little quiet betting in the landlord\u0027s back parlour.\u0027 \u0027That will be enough for us, to begin with at any rate.\u0027 \u0027Of course, the private address is only a matter of a day or two longer,\u0027 Mr. Slippen went on. \u0027I have only to send that boy of mine up to the place, and the first time the fellow goes there he will follow him, if it is all over London, till he traces him to the place where he lives. If, as he said, he is going to give up attending the races for the present, he may not go there for a day or two. But he is sure to do so sooner or later for letters.\u0027 \u0027Thank you. It would be as well to know where he lives, but at any rate when we have what we may call his business address we shall have time to talk over our next move.\u0027 \u0027Yes, that is where the real difficulty will begin, Captain Hampton. I expect you have got to deal with a deep one, and I own that at present I do not see my way at all clear before me.\u0027 \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3176/87078.html","bookId":858,"book":{"id":858,"title":"Dorothy\u0027s Double","description":"简介： A dark night on the banks of the Thames; the south-west wind, heavily charged with sleet, was blowing strongly, causing little waves to lap against the side of a punt moored by the bank.
