In fact, we just received the bare details of the planned action today.”\\n\\n “We’re still reviewing the plans the SWD has proposed to determine if they will be effective,” Dwayne added.\\n\\n The president folded his arms and smirked slightly. “You’re involved in this operation at this point only because Commandant Pierce and Dr. Curran pushed for it. I don’t like including people who have a personal stake in an operation.”\\n\\n “Excuse me, but we all have a personal stake in this mission,” Commandant Pierce protested. “If it fails, we all die.”\\n\\n Dwayne knew what was coming before the president directed his gaze toward him.\\n\\n “But you’re not fucking Vanguard Martinez.”\\n\\n Caitlyn’s eyes widened, but Dwayne couldn’t worry about his daughter at this moment. It was a cheap shot by the president to knock him off his game, and he was not about to relent. Millions of lives were on the line.\\n\\n Commandant Pierce barely acknowledged the comment. Her eyes briefly shifted toward Dwayne, then she riveted her gaze directly on the president. “We’ve been studying the SWD plans for the elimination of the Inferi Scourge around the walls. The Maelstrom Platforms will not kill all the Inferi Scourge. Some will be missed. They might scatter. The Inferi Boon will have to track them down and eradicate them. The trained soldiers of the Constabulary can assist them in clearing the valley now that the number of Inferi Scourge are significantly reduced. If you allow us to plan the mission, we can assure that there will not be an evacuation to Section A.”\\n\\n “The SWD is in charge. It’s staying that way. You two should be more concerned about the potential of initiating Section A and preparing for possible riots if food production over the next few months does not reach expected levels. This isn’t over yet. We’re just trying to make sure we all have a chance at surviving. You have your orders.”\\n\\n “You can’t keep playing the SWD and Constabulary against each other,” Commandant Pierce protested.\\n\\n “Why not? It’s keeping you both on your toes and finally getting results,” President Cabot answered before pivoting away and striding up the corridor.\\n\\n Dwayne watched as the vice president, his daughter, and the entourage of council members and security hurried after the president. Caitlyn glanced over her shoulder one last time, anger and pride mixed in her eyes. Dwayne had a feeling he’d be getting an irate call from her later. In some ways she was very much her mother’s daughter.\\n\\n Commandant Pierce waited until they turned a corner before swinging around toward Dwayne. Her dark eyes were livid.\\n\\n “That could have gone better,” Dwayne dared to say.\\n\\n “Vanguard Martinez, huh?” The lightness of her tone in contrast to the angry set of her jaw and tense body surprised him.\\n\\n “We were trying to be discreet.”\\n\\n A slight smile crept onto her full, dark lips as she nodded. “Good for you.”\\n\\n “I keep my personal life out of my work,” Dwayne said in a hushed tone.\\n\\n “Of course, you do. That is why I have always trusted you to do what is right.” Standing with her hands behind her back, she sighed. “I should have spoken up long before this point.”\\n\\n “President Cabot does hold grudges, doesn’t he?”\\n\\n “He’s nefarious about it.” Commandant Pierce shook her head. “This is ridiculous. We shouldn’t be squabbling. We should be united in this effort.”\\n\\n “My thoughts exactly,” Mr. Petersen said, stepping around her and flashing his pearly white teeth. “Certainly you must understand the need for there to be a chain of command? The SWD is firmly in control of the situation despite the changes that have been...requested in today’s meetings. I understand that you may feel the Constabulary will not receive the proper amount of credit once we have destroyed the Inferi Scourge, and you’re most likely correct. But at least we can all take heart that you will handle the possible upcoming food shortages with a deft hand.”\\n\\n “You’re an insidious little shit,” Commandant Pierce said in a low voice. “And my question is are you the man at the top or are you sucking someone’s dick to remain their lap dog?”\\n\\n Mr. Petersen simply smiled.\\n\\n “SWD Black Ops may try to keep a low profile behind the ruse of Admiral Kirkpatrick and you as his adjutant, but if you blow this mission, I’m sure the president would be more than happy to drag you all out into the light and expose you for your failures.”\\n\\n “Strange how the political maneuvering has become more cumbersome the closer we come to success,” Mr. Petersen said in a light voice. “And how clumsily it’s handled by some while others manage to get everything they desire.”\\n\\n “We teeter at the edge of extinction and all the SWD is concerned about is usurping the Constabulary and moving into a position of power.”\\n\\n Dwayne stood next to his commanding officer feeling more proud of her than he ever had before. She was pure steel.\\n\\n “Ah, you’re mistaken,” Mr. Petersen said with his fake little smile. “Commandant Pierce, we are in power.”\\n\\n With that chilling comment, Mr. Petersen strode away.\\n\\n “Who is he really?” Dwayne wondered under his breath.\\n\\n Commandant Pierce shook her head with irritation. “He’s a loathsome creature.”\\n\\n “I better get back to the SWD Command Center and oversee the rescue mission.”\\n\\n “Keep me abreast of the situation. I’ll join you shortly. I’ll show that little runt how clumsy I am at political maneuvering. I still have a few trump cards.”\\n\\n “Yes, sir.” Dwayne turned to depart and saw Dr. Curran staring at him from down the corridor. Realizing he had spotted her, she looked away, busily scribbling on her pad.\\n\\n Disconcerted, he departed.\\n\\n Chapter 28\\n\\n Tucked behind her work console as the carrier sped across the valley, Maria tracked the progress of the carrier while conversing with Dwayne. After months of monotonous killing, the squad was galvanized to be facing an enemy that had the capacity to respond with intelligent action. Their fear and excitement were tangible as they spoke in hushed voices. Tucked on top of the carrier, Holm and McKinney were manning the rigged flamethrowers.\\n\\n It was difficult for Maria to contain her composure every time she spoke to Dwayne. His low, soothing voice was a balm to her exhausted mind. The warmth in his blue eyes stirred within her the desire to slip into his arms, press her face to his neck, relish his warmth, delight at the touch of his hands on her skin, and feel his heart beating against hers.\\n\\n Outwardly, she managed to maintain her professional demeanor.\\n\\n “We’re keeping away from the remaining Scrag herds. A few are following, but shouldn’t be an issue,” Maria informed Dwayne.\\n\\n “There doesn’t seem to be any major shifts in the remaining herds,” Dwayne agreed.\\n\\n “We should be at the rendezvous point in fifteen minutes.”\\n\\n “I wish we didn’t have to do the drop so close to the hydroelectric station,” Dwayne said with a dour look on his face.\\n\\n “Time is of the essence.” Maria’s gaze darted to the front of the carrier, where Cormier deftly drove the large vehicle. Through the window she could see the distant shape of the station next to a large lake. Tall pine trees dotted the foothills beyond the glimmering dark waves. It was the exact location she dreamed of having a home with Dwayne. The thought warmed her.\\n\\n “Has there been any communication with Chief Defender Omondi?”\\n\\n “Nothing. We can’t reach him since he took shelter in the basement,” Dwayne answered.\\n\\n Maria briefly touched his image on her console. Despite the weariness about his eyes, his calm strength emanated outward, soothing her fears. She had been surprised when he had personally logged on to coordinate with her, but the sight of Commandant Pierce and Mr. Petersen lingering in the background had spoken volumes. The operation must be considered a high priority to have the Constabulary and SWD upper echelon working together.\\n\\n The jostling of the carrier drew Maria’s attention to the front window. She could see several thick masses of Inferi Scourge slowly rousing as they approached. Cormier was fast to redirect the carrier path so they wouldn’t be cut off by the creatures.\\n\\n “It’s getting tricky out here, Castellan.” Maria did another scan of their position. Several of the stagnant Inferi Scourge masses were beginning to move in their direction.\\n\\n “The tiltrotor is en route. You’re right on schedule,” Dwayne assured her.\\n\\n “Any chance of air support?” Maria lifted an eyebrow at him.\\n\\n “I’ll see what I can do.”\\n\\n His feed cut off and Maria grumbled under her breath in Spanish. She hated it when politics became entangled in the matters of the Constabulary. It was worse now that they were in the field and desperately needed some assistance. They were so close to finally being done with this mission, but it was becoming even more harrowing the closer they got to completion. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-bastion-of-the-living/page-57.html","bookId":2486,"book":{"id":2486,"title":"The Last Bastion of the Living","description":"Storyline: The Last Bastion of the Living: A Futuristic Zombie Novel \\n As long as the undead hordes of the Inferi Scourge howl outside the dying city, the last remaining humans struggle to survive inside The Bastion.
