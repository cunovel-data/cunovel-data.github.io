Unlike other speakers, he didn’t fidget or shift his weight. He remained almost perfectly still. As always, Maria had the impression that his every word, movement, and expression was carefully calculated to elicit a desired response. “It has been a few weeks since we last spoke. I hope your time in the SWD facility has been comfortable. It’s been a bit of a vacation, hasn’t it?” A flash of his pearly white teeth and the merriment in his eyes pulled smiles onto the faces of his listeners and a few chuckles. “Alas, it’s time to go to work.” His grin broadened as the men and women before him looked visibly relieved, excited and apprehensive all at once. “But I know that each and every one of you is glad to hear that at last you will be getting down to the very dirty business of finally removing the Inferi Scourge from outside the walls.”\n The volunteers cheered as the excitement in the room swelled.\n “He’s good,” Maria remarked, slightly impressed\n “Yes.” Dr. Curran’s voice was clipped. “He is.”\n “There’s no need to reiterate the enormous importance of what you have volunteered to do for humanity. It’s no secret that humankind has stood on the brink of extinction since the Inferi Scourge decimated our nations and brought us to our knees.” As Mr. Petersen spoke, behind him flashed historical vids of the glories of the old world before transitioning to uncensored coverage of the Scourge rampaging through the cities.\n “I’ve never seen these before,” Maria said, unable to look away from the bloody footage of the Inferi Scourge swarming their victims. Once the hapless victim was revived as Scourge, the rabid creatures moved on.\n Dr. Curran sighed slightly, glancing up at the proceedings in the other room. “The government felt it was best not to show the more disturbing vids. When the survivors were being airlifted to the city, it was determined that for their psychological wellbeing the more graphic historical vids should be removed from the public archives. This was supposed to be the new Eden. They didn’t want to remind the new Adams and Eves of the snakes outside the gate.”\n The vids running behind Mr. Petersen clearly showed that The Bastion had been heavily promoted as the new Garden of Eden: a utopia in the midst of a dying world. Maria tore her gaze from the vids of the construction of The Bastion to the faces of the men and women that would soon be Inferi Boon soldiers. They were staring in rapt attention at the images being played. Maria had to admit they were inspiring. Mr. Petersen narrated as the vids revealed the extensive work that had gone into creating the new Eden. Mountain passes were destroyed so that only one gated entrance remained into the valley. Scenes of the massive airlift of prefabricated buildings into the valley were impressive, as was the footage of the construction of the city walls.\n “This was our new home. Our new Eden. In fact the nickname for The Bastion in those exhilarating first days was actually New Eden. Once it was ready, human survivors from all over the globe were transported to this location from the last remaining human enclaves. I’m sure your own families tell of the harrowing escapes from nearly overrun rescue centers. My own grandfather only escaped because he managed to lash himself to the skids of the last helicopter leaving South Africa when there was no more room inside the aircraft to carry out anymore survivors.”\n Mr. Petersen was not relating any new information to the people in the room, but he was making it a personal journey. Maria could see the emotion building in the eyes of the people listening to the man in the white suit. Maybe it was because she was Inferi Boon now, or maybe because she wasn’t in the room surrounded by her comrades, but she could see how expertly he was manipulating them all.\n “This has to be fair,” Maria said at last to Dr. Curran. “The choice they make to either become what I am or not should be their own. They shouldn’t be manipulated into it.”\n Dr. Curran angled her head toward Maria. “Is anything he is saying a lie?”\n “No, but-”\n “You said you wanted them to make the decision you didn’t get to make, right?”\n “Yes, but-”\n “We killed you and brought you back as Inferi Boon. Yet instead of harboring a grudge, you have agreed to go out there and destroy the Inferi Scourge.”\n Maria nodded, already knowing what Dr. Curran was going to say.\n “You’re doing it because this city is humanity’s last chance. If this city falls, humanity ceases to exist.” Dr. Curran’s gaze didn’t waver from Maria’s eyes. “Am I wrong?”\n “No, you’re not.”\n “So let Mr. Petersen tell his stirring and patriotic story. Let those men and women in there remember what the stakes are. Let them see how our world almost died and how the last remaining nations of the world did their best to save us all. We stand on the brink of our own extinction. A little patriotism isn’t going to hurt anything.”\n Maria gave the scientist a brisk nod. She didn’t like feeling manipulated by the powers that be, but Dr. Curran was right. Even though she was angry at the deception that surrounded her transformation, her feelings seemed petty in comparison to the distress that filled the city. Her death and resurrection could possibly save millions. With or without the rousing presentation Mr. Petersen was giving, she would have volunteered. There was no doubt in her mind.\n “For five years The Bastion not only survived, but thrived. The city and the valley were filled with hardworking people who created a new way of life.” Mr. Petersen’s narration was now accompanied by scenes of cattle grazing in lush pastures, fruit laden orchards, and sprouting fields of grain. “The Bastion was humanity’s ultimate success in the aftermath of its worst tragedy.” Mr. Petersen took a deep breath, dropping his gaze for a few moments. Lifting them just as the screen began to show the Scourge rampaging through the idyllic farmland around the city, Mr. Petersen said, “Then the gate failed.”\n Falling silent, Mr. Petersen allowed uncensored footage of the slaughter of the men, women, and children who had once lived and worked in the shadow of the city to play out in all its visceral terror.\n Maria averted her eyes, unable to watch the massacre, but her gaze was gradually drawn to the appalling images. It was difficult to comprehend the sheer terror that had engulfed The Bastion on that day. She gasped as a news drone recorded the city gate closing. Countless people tried to scramble inside before the heavy steel doors shut, some being crushed as they closed. The remaining people screamed and beat against the doors as the Scourge tore into them. Shots from above killed both the non-infected and the Scourge.\n “In one tragic morning, we lost nearly half our population and all our natural resources.” Mr. Petersen rested on hand on the podium, as if to steady himself. “Ladies and gentlemen, my fellow citizens of The Bastion, we must close the gate and destroy the Inferi Scourge outside the city walls. We have no other choice.”\n “That’s your cue,” Dr. Curran said, tapping Maria’s hand.\n Standing, Maria straightened her uniform and ran a gentle hand over her hair, checking that it was smooth and her bun secure. Dr. Curran led the way to a door that she palmed open. Maria followed in her wake, then stepped into the debriefing room.\n Immediately she was under scrutiny. Her appearance brought one or two sharp intakes of breath. Jameson’s eyes widened as one or two of the veterans who knew her audibly gasped. A few of the soldiers didn’t immediately recognize her Inferi Boon condition, but when they did she could see the fear in their eyes. A few of the soldiers looked in confusion between her and Mr. Petersen.\n “We promised that you would be able to walk among the Inferi Scourge. That they wouldn’t identify you as prey,” Mr. Petersen said in a low, but clear voice. “We were not lying to you.”\n “She’s a Scrag!” Jameson exclaimed, the words bursting from his mouth, spittle flecking his lips.\n “Yes, I am.” Maria moved to stand at Mr. Petersen’s side. “But I am a thinking Scrag. My mind and personality are intact. I am still Vanguard Maria Martinez of the Constabulary of The Bastion. I am still strong, agile, and able to defend this city and its citizens to the best of my ability. I can walk among the Scrags and kill them with no remorse. I do not hunger. I do not sleep.”\n Gideon was watching her intently, his trembling hands tucked under his chin as he listened. Jameson’s mouth remained open in disbelief.\n A female soldier with dark skin and black eyes that Maria didn’t know asked, “How do you know they won’t attack you?”\n Maria knew that the vid she had helped Dr. Curran edit together was now showing behind her. It would reveal the highlights of her testing, including her standing in a room crowded with Inferi Scourge, untouched by them. “I have undergone a series of tests over the last two weeks. I am the ultimate weapon against the Scrags. Dr. Curran assured me that when we’re done purging the valley of all the Scrags, we will be restored to life.”\n Dr. Curran stepped forward as Mr. Petersen abandoned the podium. “I am Doctor Beverly Curran. I am in charge of the Inferi Boon Project. What Vanguard Martinez has told you is the truth. We can restore you and give you an antidote to destroy the modified virus. You will be able to build a new life for yourselves once the valley is free. Vanguard Martinez is our first Inferi Boon Special Ops. She can answer all your questions and alleviate any of the fears you may have about the procedure.” Beverly took a breath as the men and women before her shifted uncomfortably in their chairs and stared at her warily. “This mission still remains voluntary. If you decide to withdraw from the program, you will continue to stay in the SWD facility for the next six months until the operation is over. Consider it an extended vacation, but this mission must remain top secret. Though the city knows that the government has plans to remove the Inferi Scourge from the valley, it has been determined that there will be an outcry if they discover the truth about the Inferi Boon Special Ops. The fear of the Inferi Scourge is deep-seated in our psyche. We don’t want there to be any discrimination or fear associated with your returns to society. Therefore, our cover story is that special armor was used to enable you to move among the Inferi Scourge. No one will ever know about what you had to become to save The Bastion. Before entering this mission debriefing, you were all sworn to secrecy. That oath will remain intact whether or not you’re on the mission. Once the mission is successfully completed, those participating in the mission will be publically acknowledged by the president. Those who decide to opt out will be listed as support personnel. Am I clear?” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-bastion-of-the-living/page-24.html","bookId":2486,"book":{"id":2486,"title":"The Last Bastion of the Living","description":"Storyline: \n The Last Bastion of the Living: A Futuristic Zombie Novel \n As long as the undead hordes of the Inferi Scourge howl outside the dying city, the last remaining humans struggle to survive inside The Bastion.
