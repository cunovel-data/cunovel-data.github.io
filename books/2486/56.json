The Inferi Scourge glowed red against the brilliant blue hues of the projected valley, mountains and city.\n “Can we handle them with the platforms?” President Cabot again looked to the Constabulary officers.\n Dwayne kept his face neutral. He didn’t like where this line of thinking was going. “Based on our previous experience battling the Inferi Scourge with the Maelstrom Platforms, I would say yes.”\n “Only the ones around the city. Those clusters east of the city are out of range,” Mr. Petersen hurriedly added.\n “Do we have the firepower and fuel to eliminate what’s left of the Inferi Scourge with the tiltrotors?” the president asked.\n Dwayne’s spine stiffened. Next to him Commandant Pierce’s eyes narrowed.\n “That is a question for the SWD. They conscripted the Maelstrom Platforms and the remaining ammunition per your order,” Commandant Pierce said in a terse tone.\n “Other than the ammunition on reserve for the Section A evac, we don’t control the ammunition stores. The SWD does,” Dwayne added grimly.\n President Cabot directed his stern gaze at Mr. Petersen. “Well?”\n “We have sufficient ammunition to clear out those pockets,” Mr. Petersen admitted. “But it will be a significant drain on our resources. That weaponry was set aside for the final elimination of the Inferi Scourge around the wall.”\n “We need the Inferi Boon to finish their mission,” Dr. Curran said firmly. “Destroying the Anomalies must be a top priority.”\n “But we might risk extending the mission when we’re on the verge of a severe food crisis,” the president said in a cold tone. “We can’t afford to have riots in the streets. If we are forced to begin restrictions, the city will lose faith in us and we will have a mess on our hands. I was promised that this time there wouldn’t be a failure with the Inferi Boon.”\n “There won’t be,” Dr. Curran said quickly.\n “Let us drop weapons to our people.” Commandant Pierce leaned toward President Cabot. “Let us do our job efficiently and with proper weaponry.”\n “We can’t risk drawing the Inferi Scourge away from the wall.” Mr. Petersen gave Dr. Curran a withering look. “Don’t you agree?”\n “The Anomalies need to be our concern,” Dr. Curran argued. “They have already breached the subway and sewer systems. They’re a real threat to this city’s security. Arm the Inferi Boon and let them deal with the situation. If the aircraft does draw Inferi Scourge away from the wall, let the Inferi Boon deal with them.”\n “If we end up extending the mission, the food crisis will not be avoided,” Vice President April Sims said, daring to finally speak up. “We’re already gambling with the belief that we can start producing crops as soon as the valley is cleared and safe.”\n President Cabot gave her a withering look.\n Dwayne couldn’t keep his silence on the matter anymore. “Instead of preparing for Section A and potential food riots, we should have warned the citizens long before now. If there is a delay in this mission, there will be serious ramifications because this administration has not been forthcoming with the populace.”\n “I will remember your words,” the president said crossly.\n Caitlyn shot a worried look at her father and he winked at her reassuringly. Caitlyn had yet to understand how truly messy things could be at the upper levels of government, but she was certainly learning swiftly.\n “He’s right,” Commandant Peirce spoke up. “We’re teetering on the edge of extinction, our only hope resting on the people we killed and made into Inferi Boon to do our bidding and we won’t even arm them against the Anomalies?”\n “We already had to deal with one delay by pulling Special Constable Jameson out of the field. That tiltrotor pulled an estimated twenty thousand Inferi Scourge away from the city walls. We can’t afford to do that again.” Mr. Petersen’s bland face was becoming eerily calm.\n “At the rate the Inferi Boon have been killing, that is not even a half day delay. At one point the squads were killing eight hundred Inferi Scourge a minute.” Dwayne was well-acquainted with all the numbers since the commandant had insisted on his inclusion at the meeting.\n “That was when the Inferi Scourge were packed so tightly together that our people had to hardly move to be within killing reach of the next one. Now they’re more scattered and it takes much longer. The kill counts have decreased. Especially since they lost Jameson. He was a blood-thirsty one.” Mr. Petersen’s voice was calm and accommodating, but his smile was shark-like.\n “He was a blood thirsty one?” Commandant Pierce’s voice was like knives, sharp and cruel.\n “He died unexpectedly yesterday,” Dr. Curran said, averting her eyes.\n “A sad loss. A true hero,” the President said. His words sounded well-rehearsed and empty.\n “The point is that we cannot afford delays. Our fuel, food, and ammunition stores are nearly depleted. If we do not clear the valley within the next week, we will have to implement Section A,” Mr. Petersen said. “And that is not acceptable.”\n “And you’re not on the evacuation list, are you?” Dwayne gave the man a mirthless smile.\n Mr. Petersen rewarded him with a bland look and a slight shrug. “I have the city’s interests at heart.”\n “If the Inferi Boon don’t have sufficient weaponry to fight off the Anomalies, this conversation will be moot. They will fail. We will fail and the Section A evacuation will commence,” Commandant Pierce said. The sharp beauty of her face only added to the power of her words. “If the Inferi Boon are our only hope, then give them the damn weapons.”\n “If there is a delay-” Mr. Petersen started.\n “Give them the weapons,” the president said. His glum face was turned toward the hologram of the valley. “One aircraft. Air drop the weapons. But after the Inferi Boon destroy the Anomalies, we will launch our final assault on the Inferi Scourge.”\n “The pockets of Inferi Scourge along the eastern edge of the valley-”\n “Mr. Petersen, you said that we had the weaponry for one final assault, so plan to eliminate those pockets of Inferi Scourge as well. I do not want any more delays. I’m done with this Inferi Boon, Inferi Anomaly, Inferi-fucking-Scourge business! Clean it up! Give the city a gawddamn show and keep us from starving to death. You said you could do it. Then fucking do it.” The president glowered at the silent people gathered around the table then turned his scorching gaze to Mr. Petersen. “Am I clear?”\n “Absolutely,” Mr. Petersen answered.\n Dwayne noticed he wasn’t the only one suppressing a smile.\n “Then we’re done here,” the president said, rising to his feet.\n Dwayne and the commandant swiftly moved to intercept the departing leader as he entered the corridor. His staff looked nervous and sufficiently cowed by the president’s outburst. He was well-known for his temper away from the news cameras and his face was flushed, the veins in his neck standing out sharply.\n “President Cabot, a word please,” Commandant Pierce called out, trying to edge around a security officer.\n The handsome man with the killer looks and wide grin that was so pleasing to the public fastened a glower upon the commandant that was far removed from his public face. “The meeting is over, Commandant Pierce.”\n “Yet the Constabulary continues to play a secondary role in this infamous finale the SWD has planned. I have towed the line and done as you wished for months now, but I know if I had been included in this mission from its inception we would be much closer to success instead of a potential disaster.” Commandant Pierce met the president’s stare without fear and with a touch of defiance.\n “The Constabulary was responsible for one of the worst losses of life and resources The Bastion has endured since the gate failed. Your final push was a disaster.”\n “Yes, and my predecessor resigned in the aftermath. I am not Commandant Young.”\n The president chuckled. “You’ll have to do better than that.”\n “I’m sworn to protect this city,” Dwayne said. “That’s the role I play. I should have been included in the planning of this mission and its implementation. The SWD has security officers, not trained military men and women. There is a huge difference in their training. Why else would have the SWD asked for the best of the Constabulary soldiers?”\n The president motioned his security aside as the vice president lingered just behind him. A small smile on her lips revealed clearly how much she enjoyed seeing the president put on the spot. Caitlyn stood just behind her, watching with keen interest.\n “You do have a point there. And I do commend you for the performance of your soldiers out in the field. It’s obvious from the number of Inferi Scourge that they have killed in the last few months that they’re strong and capable men and women. Whereas the SWD security forces suffered a painful loss today, your people are still in play. So well done. But that doesn’t take away the fact that both of you have been a part of the dismal failures of the Constabulary in the past and the SWD has implemented a successful plan of action. Let me repeat that in case both of you hard heads didn’t catch that. The Constabulary failed in its plan for a final push. Failed. Yes, you were both lower-ranking officers at that time, but you had a part in the planning of that mission. I don’t trust failures.” The president was smiling, but his tone was lethal. “That is why you weren’t given a seat on the planning council and the SWD has taken point on this mission.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-bastion-of-the-living/page-56.html","bookId":2486,"book":{"id":2486,"title":"The Last Bastion of the Living","description":"Storyline: \n The Last Bastion of the Living: A Futuristic Zombie Novel \n As long as the undead hordes of the Inferi Scourge howl outside the dying city, the last remaining humans struggle to survive inside The Bastion.
