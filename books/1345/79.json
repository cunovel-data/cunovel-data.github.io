{"id":33383,"no":79,"title":"CHAPTER LXXVII. JOHN KENNEBY\u0027S DOOM.","content":"On the evening but one after the trial was over Mr. Moulder entertained a few friends to supper at his apartments in Great St. Helen\u0027s, and it was generally understood that in doing so he intended to celebrate the triumph of Lady Mason. Through the whole affair he had been a strong partisan on her side, had expressed a very loud opinion in favour of Mr. Furnival, and had hoped that that scoundrel Dockwrath would get all that he deserved from the hands of Mr. Chaffanbrass. When the hour of Mr. Dockwrath\u0027s punishment had come he had been hardly contented, but the inadequacy of Kenneby\u0027s testimony had restored him to good humour, and the verdict had made him triumphant. \"Didn\u0027t I know it, old fellow?\" he had said, slapping his friend Snengkeld on the back. \"When such a low scoundrel as Dockwrath is pitted against a handsome woman like Lady Mason he\u0027ll not find a jury in England to give a verdict in his favour.\" Then he asked Snengkeld to come to his little supper; and Kantwise also he invited, though Kantwise had shown Dockwrath tendencies throughout the whole affair;—but Moulder was fond of Kantwise as a butt for his own sarcasm. Mrs. Smiley, too, was asked, as was natural, seeing that she was the betrothed bride of one of the heroes of the day; and Moulder, in the kindness of his heart, swore that he never was proud, and told Bridget Bolster that she would be welcome to take a share of what was going. \"Laws, M.,\" said Mrs. Moulder, when she was told of this. \"A chambermaid from an inn! What will Mrs. Smiley say?\" \"I ain\u0027t going to trouble myself with what Mother Smiley may say or think about my friends. If she don\u0027t like it, she may do the other thing. What was she herself when you first knew her?\" \"Yes, Moulder; but then money do make a difference, you know.\" Bridget Bolster, however, was invited, and she came in spite of the grandeur of Mrs. Smiley. Kenneby also of course was there, but he was not in a happy frame of mind. Since that wretched hour in which he had heard himself described by the judge as too stupid to be held of any account by the jury he had become a melancholy, misanthropic man. The treatment which he received from Mr. Furnival had been very grievous to him, but he had borne with that, hoping that some word of eulogy from the judge would set him right in the public mind. But no such word had come, and poor John Kenneby felt that the cruel hard world was too much for him. He had been with his sister that morning, and words had dropped from him which made her fear that he would wish to postpone his marriage for another space of ten years or so. \"Brick-fields!\" he had said. \"What can such a one as I have to do with landed property? I am better as I am.\" Mrs. Smiley, however, did not at all seem to think so, and welcomed John Kenneby back from Alston very warmly in spite of the disgrace to which he had been subjected. It was nothing to her that the judge had called her future lord a fool; nor indeed was it anything to any one but himself. According to Moulder\u0027s views it was a matter of course that a witness should be abused. For what other purpose was he had into the court? But deep in the mind of poor Kenneby himself the injurious words lay festering. He had struggled hard to tell the truth, and in doing so had simply proved himself to be an ass. \"I ain\u0027t fit to live with anybody else but myself,\" he said to himself, as he walked down Bishopsgate Street. At this time Mrs. Smiley was not yet there. Bridget had arrived, and had been seated in a chair at one corner of the fire. Mrs. Moulder occupied one end of a sofa opposite, leaving the place of honour at the other end for Mrs. Smiley. Moulder sat immediately in front of the fire in his own easy chair, and Snengkeld and Kantwise were on each side of him. They were of course discussing the trial when Mrs. Smiley was announced; and it was well that she made a diversion by her arrival, for words were beginning to run high. \"A jury of her countrymen has found her innocent,\" Moulder had said with much heat; \"and any one who says she\u0027s guilty after that is a libeller and a coward, to my way of thinking. If a jury of her countrymen don\u0027t make a woman innocent, what does?\" \"Of course she\u0027s innocent,\" said Snengkeld; \"from the very moment the words was spoken by the foreman. If any newspaper was to say she wasn\u0027t she\u0027d have her action.\" \"That\u0027s all very well,\" said Kantwise, looking up to the ceiling with his eyes nearly shut. \"But you\u0027ll see. What\u0027ll you bet me, Mr. Moulder, that Joseph Mason don\u0027t get the property?\" \"Gammon!\" answered Moulder. \"Well, it may be gammon; but you\u0027ll see.\" \"Gentlemen, gentlemen!\" said Mrs. Smiley, sailing into the room; \"upon my word one hears all you say ever so far down the street.\" \"And I didn\u0027t care if they heard it right away to the Mansion House,\" said Moulder. \"We ain\u0027t talking treason, nor yet highway robbery.\" Then Mrs. Smiley was welcomed;—her bonnet was taken from her and her umbrella, and she was encouraged to spread herself out over the sofa. \"Oh, Mrs. Bolster; the witness!\" she said, when Mrs. Moulder went through some little ceremony of introduction. And from the tone of her voice it appeared that she was not quite satisfied that Mrs. Bolster should be there as a companion for herself. \"Yes, ma\u0027am. I was the witness as had never signed but once,\" said Bridget, getting up and curtsying. Then she sat down again, folding her hands one over the other on her lap. \"Oh, indeed!\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"But where\u0027s the other witness, Mrs. Moulder? He\u0027s the one who is a deal more interesting to me. Ha, ha, ha! But as you all know it here, what\u0027s the good of not telling the truth? Ha, ha, ha!\" \"John\u0027s here,\" said Mrs. Moulder. \"Come, John, why don\u0027t you show yourself?\" \"He\u0027s just alive, and that\u0027s about all you can say for him,\" said Moulder. \"Why, what\u0027s there been to kill him?\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"Well, John, I must say you\u0027re rather backward in coming forward, considering what there\u0027s been between us. You might have come and taken my shawl, I\u0027m thinking.\" \"Yes, I might,\" said Kenneby gloomily. \"I hope I see you pretty well, Mrs. Smiley.\" \"Pretty bobbish, thank you. Only I think it might have been Maria between friends like us.\" \"He\u0027s sadly put about by this trial,\" whispered Mrs. Moulder. \"You know he is so tender-hearted that he can\u0027t bear to be put upon like another.\" \"But you didn\u0027t want her to be found guilty; did you, John?\" \"That I\u0027m sure he didn\u0027t,\" said Moulder. \"Why it was the way he gave his evidence that brought her off.\" \"It wasn\u0027t my wish to bring her off,\" said Kenneby; \"nor was it my wish to make her guilty. All I wanted was to tell the truth and do my duty. But it was no use. I believe it never is any use.\" \"I think you did very well,\" said Moulder. \"I\u0027m sure Lady Mason ought to be very much obliged to you,\" said Kantwise. \"Nobody needn\u0027t care for what\u0027s said to them in a court,\" said Snengkeld. \"I remember when once they wanted to make out that I\u0027d taken a parcel of teas—\" \"Stolen, you mean, sir,\" suggested Mrs. Smiley. \"Yes; stolen. But it was only done by the opposite side in court, and I didn\u0027t think a halfporth of it. They knew where the teas was well enough.\" \"Speaking for myself,\" said Kenneby, \"I must say I don\u0027t like it.\" \"But the paper as we signed,\" said Bridget, \"wasn\u0027t the old gentleman\u0027s will,—no more than this is;\" and she lifted up her apron. \"I\u0027m rightly sure of that.\" Then again the battle raged hot and furious, and Moulder became angry with his guest, Bridget Bolster. Kantwise finding himself supported in his views by the principal witness at the trial took heart against the tyranny of Moulder and expressed his opinion, while Mrs. Smiley, with a woman\u0027s customary dislike to another woman, sneered ill-naturedly at the idea of Lady Mason\u0027s innocence. Poor Kenneby had been forced to take the middle seat on the sofa between his bride and sister; but it did not appear that the honour of his position had any effect in lessening his gloom or mitigating the severity of the judgment which had been passed on him. \"Wasn\u0027t the old gentleman\u0027s will!\" said Moulder, turning on poor Bridget in his anger with a growl. \"But I say it was the old gentleman\u0027s will. You never dared say as much as that in court.\" \"I wasn\u0027t asked,\" said Bridget. \"You weren\u0027t asked! Yes, you was asked often enough.\" \"I\u0027ll tell you what it is,\" said Kantwise, \"Mrs. Bolster\u0027s right in what she says as sure as your name\u0027s Moulder.\" \"Then as sure as my name\u0027s Moulder she\u0027s wrong. I suppose we\u0027re to think that a chap like you knows more about it than the jury! We all know who your friend is in the matter. I haven\u0027t forgot our dinner at Leeds, nor sha\u0027n\u0027t in a hurry.\" \"Now, John,\" said Mrs. Smiley, \"nobody can know the truth of this so well as you do. You\u0027ve been as close as wax, as was all right till the lady was out of her troubles. That\u0027s done and over, and let us hear among friends how the matter really was.\" And then there was silence among them in order that his words might come forth freely. \"Come, my dear,\" said Mrs. Smiley with a tone of encouraging love. \"There can\u0027t be any harm now; can there?\" \"Out with it, John,\" said Moulder. \"You\u0027re honest, anyways.\" \"There ain\u0027t no gammon about you,\" said Snengkeld. \"Mr. Kenneby can speak if he likes, no doubt,\" said Kantwise; \"though maybe it mayn\u0027t be very pleasant to him to do so after all that\u0027s come and gone.\" \"There\u0027s nothing that\u0027s come and gone that need make our John hold his tongue,\" said Mrs. Moulder. \"He mayn\u0027t be just as bright as some of those lawyers, but he\u0027s a deal more true-hearted.\" \"But he can\u0027t say as how it was the old gentleman\u0027s will as we signed. I\u0027m well assured of that,\" said Bridget. But Kenneby, though thus called upon by the united strength of the company to solve all their doubts, still remained silent. \"Come, lovey,\" said Mrs. Smiley, putting forth her hand and giving his arm a tender squeeze. \"If you\u0027ve anything to say to clear that woman\u0027s character,\" said Moulder, \"you owe it to society to say it; because she is a woman, and because her enemies is villains.\" And then again there was silence while they waited for him. \"I think it will go with him to his grave,\" said Mrs. Smiley, very solemnly. \"I shouldn\u0027t wonder,\" said Snengkeld. \"Then he must give up all idea of taking a wife,\" said Moulder. \"He won\u0027t do that I\u0027m sure,\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"That he won\u0027t. Will you, John?\" said his sister. \"There\u0027s no knowing what may happen to me in this world,\" said Kenneby, \"but sometimes I almost think I ain\u0027t fit to live in it, along with anybody else.\" \"You\u0027ll make him fit, won\u0027t you, my dear?\" said Mrs. Moulder. \"I don\u0027t exactly know what to say about it,\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"If Mr. Kenneby ain\u0027t willing, I\u0027m not the woman to bind him to his word, because I\u0027ve had his promise over and over again, and could prove it by a number of witnesses before any jury in the land. I\u0027m an independent woman as needn\u0027t be beholden to any man, and I should never think of damages. Smiley left me comfortable before all the world, and I don\u0027t know but what I\u0027m a fool to think of changing. Anyways if Mr. Kenneby—\" \"Come, John. Why don\u0027t you speak to her?\" said Mrs. Moulder. \"And what am I to say?\" said Kenneby, thrusting himself forth from between the ample folds of the two ladies\u0027 dresses. \"I\u0027m a blighted man; one on whom the finger of scorn has been pointed. His lordship said that I was—stupid; and perhaps I am.\" \"She don\u0027t think nothing of that, John.\" \"Certainly not,\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"As long as a man can pay twenty shillings in the pound and a trifle over, what does it matter if all the judges in the land was to call him stupid?\" said Snengkeld. \"Stupid is as stupid does,\" said Kantwise. \"Stupid be d——,\" said Moulder. \"Mr. Moulder, there\u0027s ladies present,\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"Come, John, rouse yourself a bit,\" said his sister. \"Nobody here thinks the worse of you for what the judge said.\" \"Certainly not,\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"And as it becomes me to speak, I\u0027ll say my mind. I\u0027m accustomed to speak freely before friends, and as we are all friends here, why should I be ashamed?\" \"For the matter of that nobody says you are,\" said Moulder. \"And I don\u0027t mean, Mr. Moulder. Why should I? I can pay my way, and do what I like with my own, and has people to mind me when I speak, and needn\u0027t mind nobody else myself;—and that\u0027s more than everybody can say. Here\u0027s John Kenneby and I, is engaged as man and wife. He won\u0027t say as it\u0027s not so, I\u0027ll be bound.\" \"No,\" said Kenneby, \"I\u0027m engaged I know.\" \"When I accepted John Kenneby\u0027s hand and heart,—and well I remember the beauteous language in which he expressed his feelings, and always shall,—I told him, that I respected him as a man that would do his duty by a woman, though perhaps he mightn\u0027t be so cute in the way of having much to say for himself as some others. \u0027What\u0027s the good,\u0027 said I, \u0027of a man\u0027s talking, if so be he\u0027s ashamed to meet the baker at the end of the week?\u0027 So I listened to the vows he made me, and have considered that he and I was as good as one. Now that he\u0027s been put upon by them lawyers, I\u0027m not the woman to turn my back upon him.\" \"That you\u0027re not,\" said Moulder. \"No I ain\u0027t, Mr. Moulder, and so, John, there\u0027s my hand again, and you\u0027re free to take it if you like.\" And so saying she put forth her hand almost into his lap. \"Take it, John!\" said Mrs. Moulder. But poor Kenneby himself did not seem to be very quick in availing himself of the happiness offered to him. He did raise his right arm slightly; but then he hesitated, and allowed it to fall again between him and his sister. \"Come, John, you know you mean it,\" said Mrs. Moulder. And then with both her hands she lifted his, and placed it bodily within the grasp of Mrs. Smiley\u0027s, which was still held forth to receive it. \"I know I\u0027m engaged,\" said Kenneby. \"There\u0027s no mistake about it,\" said Moulder. \"There needn\u0027t be none,\" said Mrs. Smiley, softly blushing; \"and I will say this of myself—as I have been tempted to give a promise, I\u0027m not the woman to go back from my word. There\u0027s my hand, John; and I don\u0027t care though all the world hears me say so.\" And then they sat hand in hand for some seconds, during which poor Kenneby was unable to escape from the grasp of his bride elect. One may say that all chance of final escape for him was now gone by. \"But he can\u0027t say as how it was the old gentlemen\u0027s will as we signed,\" said Bridget, breaking the silence which ensued. \"And now, ladies and gentlemen,\" said Kantwise, \"as Mrs. Bolster has come back to that matter, I\u0027ll tell you something that will surprise you. My friend Mr. Moulder here, who is as hospitable a gentleman as I know anywhere wouldn\u0027t just let me speak before.\" \"That\u0027s gammon, Kantwise. I never hindered you from speaking.\" \"How I do hate that word. If you knew my aversion, Mr. Moulder—\" \"I can\u0027t pick my words for you, old fellow.\" \"But what were you going to tell us, Mr. Kantwise?\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"Something that will make all your hairs stand on end, I think.\" And then he paused and looked round upon them all. It was at this moment that Kenneby succeeded in getting his hand once more to himself. \"Something that will surprise you all, or I\u0027m very much mistaken. Lady Mason has confessed her guilt.\" He had surprised them all. \"You don\u0027t say so,\" exclaimed Mrs. Moulder. \"Confessed her guilt,\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"But what guilt, Mr. Kantwise?\" \"She forged the will,\" said Kantwise. \"I knew that all along,\" said Bridget Bolster. \"I\u0027m d—— if I believe it,\" said Moulder. \"You can do as you like about that,\" said Kantwise; \"but she has. And I\u0027ll tell you what\u0027s more: she and young Mason have already left Orley Farm and given it all up into Joseph Mason\u0027s hands.\" \"But didn\u0027t she get a verdict?\" asked Snengkeld. \"Yes, she got a verdict. There\u0027s no doubt on earth about that.\" \"Then it\u0027s my opinion she can\u0027t make herself guilty if she wished it; and as for the property, she can\u0027t give it up. The jury has found a verdict, and nobody can go beyond that. If anybody tries she\u0027ll have her action against \u0027em.\" That was the law as laid down by Snengkeld. \"I don\u0027t believe a word of it,\" said Moulder. \"Dockwrath has told him. I\u0027ll bet a hat that Kantwise got it from Dockwrath.\" It turned out that Kantwise had received his information from Dockwrath; but nevertheless, there was that in his manner, and in the nature of the story as it was told to them, that did produce belief. Moulder for a long time held out, but it became clear at last that even he was shaken; and now, even Kenneby acknowledged his conviction that the signature to the will was not his own. \"I know\u0027d very well that I never did it twice,\" said Bridget Bolster triumphantly, as she sat down to the supper table. I am inclined to think, that upon the whole the company in Great St. Helen\u0027s became more happy as the conviction grew upon them that a great and mysterious crime had been committed, which had baffled two courts of law, and had at last thrust itself forth into the open daylight through the workings of the criminal\u0027s conscience. When Kantwise had completed his story, the time had come in which it behoved Mrs. Moulder to descend to the lower regions, and give some aid in preparation of the supper. During her absence the matter was discussed in every way, and on her return, when she was laden with good things, she found that all the party was contented except Moulder and her brother. \"It\u0027s a very terrible thing,\" said Mrs. Smiley, later in the evening, as she sat with her steaming glass of rum and water before her. \"Very terrible indeed; ain\u0027t it, John? I do wish now I\u0027d gone down and see\u0027d her, I do indeed. Don\u0027t you, Mrs. Moulder?\" \"If all this is true I should like just to have had a peep at her.\" \"At any rate we shall have pictures of her in all the papers,\" said Mrs. Smiley. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2757/76112.html","bookId":1345,"book":{"id":1345,"title":"Orley Farm","description":"简介： It is not true that a rose by any other name will smell as sweet.
