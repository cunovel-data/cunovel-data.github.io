{"id":33366,"no":62,"title":"CHAPTER LXI. THE STATE OF PUBLIC OPINION.","content":"The day of the trial was now quickly coming on, and the London world, especially the world of lawyers, was beginning to talk much on the subject. Men about the Inns of Court speculated as to the verdict, offering to each other very confident opinions as to the result, and offering, on some occasions, bets as well as opinions. The younger world of barristers was clearly of opinion that Lady Mason was innocent; but a portion, an unhappy portion, was inclined to fear, that, in spite of her innocence, she would be found guilty. The elder world of barristers was not, perhaps, so demonstrative, but in that world the belief in her innocence was not so strong, and the fear of her condemnation much stronger. The attorneys, as a rule, regarded her as guilty. To the policeman\u0027s mind every man not a policeman is a guilty being, and the attorneys perhaps share something of this feeling. But the attorneys to a man expected to see her acquitted. Great was their faith in Mr. Furnival; great their faith in Solomon Aram; but greater than in all was their faith in Mr. Chaffanbrass. If Mr. Chaffanbrass could not pull her through, with a prescription of twenty years on her side, things must be very much altered indeed in our English criminal court. To the outer world, that portion of the world which had nothing to do with the administration of the law, the idea of Lady Mason having been guilty seemed preposterous. Of course she was innocent, and of course she would be found to be innocent. And of course, also, that Joseph Mason of Groby Park was, and would be found to be, the meanest, the lowest, the most rapacious of mankind. And then the story of Sir Peregrine\u0027s attachment and proposed marriage, joined as it was to various hints of the manner in which that marriage had been broken off, lent a romance to the whole affair, and added much to Lady Mason\u0027s popularity. Everybody had now heard of it, and everybody was also aware, that though the idea of a marriage had been abandoned, there had been no quarrel. The friendship between the families was as close as ever, and Sir Peregrine,—so it was understood—had pledged himself to an acquittal. It was felt to be a public annoyance that an affair of so exciting a nature should be allowed to come off in the little town of Alston. The court-house, too, was very defective in its arrangements, and ill qualified to give accommodation to the great body of would-be attendants at the trial. One leading newspaper went so far as to suggest, that in such a case as this, the antediluvian prejudices of the British grandmother—meaning the Constitution—should be set aside, and the trial should take place in London. But I am not aware that any step was taken towards the carrying out of so desirable a project. Down at Hamworth the feeling in favour of Lady Mason was not perhaps so strong as it was elsewhere. Dockwrath was a man not much respected, but nevertheless many believed in him; and down there, in the streets of Hamworth, he was not slack in propagating his view of the question. He had no doubt, he said, how the case would go. He had no doubt, although he was well aware that Mr. Mason\u0027s own lawyers would do all they could to throw over their own client. But he was too strong, he said, even for that. The facts as he would bring them forward would confound Round and Crook, and compel any jury to find a verdict of guilty. I do not say that all Hamworth believed in Dockwrath, but his energy and confidence did have its effect, and Lady Mason\u0027s case was not upheld so strongly in her own neighbourhood as elsewhere. The witnesses in these days were of course very important persons, and could not but feel the weight of that attention which the world would certainly pay to them. There would be four chief witnesses for the prosecution; Dockwrath himself, who would be prepared to speak as to the papers left behind him by old Usbech; the man in whose possession now remained that deed respecting the partnership which was in truth executed by old Sir Joseph on that fourteenth of July; Bridget Bolster; and John Kenneby. Of the manner in which Mr. Dockwrath used his position we already know enough. The man who held the deed, one Torrington, was a relative of Martock, Sir Joseph\u0027s partner, and had been one of his executors. It was not much indeed that he had to say, but that little sent him up high in the social scale during those days. He lived at Kennington, and he was asked out to dinner in that neighbourhood every day for a week running, on the score of his connection with the great Orley Farm case. Bridget Bolster was still down at the hotel in the West of England, and being of a solid, sensible, and somewhat unimaginative turn of mind, probably went through her duties to the last without much change of manner. But the effect of the coming scenes upon poor John Kenneby was terrible. It was to him as though for the time they had made of him an Atlas, and compelled him to bear on his weak shoulders the weight of the whole world. Men did talk much about Lady Mason and the coming trial; but to him it seemed as though men talked of nothing else. At Hubbles and Grease\u0027s it was found useless to put figures into his hands till all this should be over. Indeed it was doubted by many whether he would ever recover his ordinary tone of mind. It seemed to be understood that he would be cross-examined by Chaffanbrass, and there were those who thought that John Kenneby would never again be equal to a day\u0027s work after that which he would then be made to endure. That he would have been greatly relieved could the whole thing have been wiped away from him there can be no manner of doubt; but I fancy that he would also have been disappointed. It is much to be great for a day, even though the day\u0027s greatness should cause the shipwreck of a whole life. \"I shall endeavour to speak the truth,\" said John Kenneby, solemnly. \"The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,\" said Moulder. \"Yes, Moulder, that will be my endeavour; and then I may lay my hand upon my bosom and think that I have done my duty by my country.\" And as Kenneby spoke he suited the action to the word. \"Quite right, John,\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"Them\u0027s the sentiments of a man, and I, as a woman having a right to speak where you are concerned, quite approve of them.\" \"They\u0027ll get nothing but the truth out of John,\" said Mrs. Moulder; \"not if he knows it.\" These last words she added, actuated by admiration of what she had heard of Mr. Chaffanbrass, and perhaps with some little doubt as to her brother\u0027s firmness. \"That\u0027s where it is,\" said Moulder. \"Lord bless you, John, they\u0027ll turn you round their finger like a bit of red tape. Truth! Gammon! What do they care for truth?\" \"But I care, Moulder,\" said Kenneby. \"I don\u0027t suppose they can make me tell falsehoods if I don\u0027t wish it.\" \"Not if you\u0027re the man I take you to be,\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"Gammon!\" said Moulder. \"Mr. Moulder, that\u0027s an objectionable word,\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"If John Kenneby is the man I take him to be,—and who\u0027s a right to speak if I haven\u0027t, seeing that I am going to commit myself for this world into his hands?\"—and Mrs. Smiley, as she spoke, simpered, and looked down with averted head on the fulness of her Irish tabinet—\"if he\u0027s the man that I take him to be, he won\u0027t say on this thrilling occasion no more than the truth, nor yet no less. Now that isn\u0027t gammon—if I know what gammon is.\" It will have been already seen that the party in question were assembled at Mr. Moulder\u0027s room in Great St. Helen\u0027s. There had been a little supper party there to commemorate the final arrangements as to the coming marriage, and the four were now sitting round the fire with their glasses of hot toddy at their elbows. Moulder was armed with his pipe, and was enjoying himself in that manner which most delighted him. When last we saw him he had somewhat exceeded discretion in his cups, and was not comfortable. But at the present nothing ailed him. The supper had been good, the tobacco was good, and the toddy was good. Therefore when the lovely Thais sitting beside him,—Thais however on this occasion having been provided not for himself but for his brother-in-law,—when Thais objected to the use of his favourite word, he merely chuckled down in the bottom of his fat throat, and allowed her to finish her sentence. Poor John Kenneby had more—much more, on his hands than this dreadful trial. Since he had declared that the Adriatic was free to wed another, he had found himself devoted and given up to Mrs. Smiley. For some days after that auspicious evening there had been considerable wrangling between Mrs. Moulder and Mrs. Smiley as to the proceeds of the brick-field; and on this question Moulder himself had taken a part. The Moulder interest had of course desired that all right of management in the brick-field should be vested in the husband, seeing that, according to the usages of this country, brick-fields and their belongings appertain rather to men than to women; but Mrs. Smiley had soon made it evident that she by no means intended to be merely a sleeping partner in the firm. At one time Kenneby had entertained a hope of escape; for neither would the Moulder interest give way, nor would the Smiley. But two hundred a year was a great stake, and at last the thing was arranged, very much in accordance with the original Smiley view. And now at this most trying period of his life, poor Kenneby had upon his mind all the cares of a lover as well as the cares of a witness. \"I shall do my best,\" said John. \"I shall do my best and then throw myself upon Providence.\" \"And take a little drop of something comfortable in your pocket,\" said his sister, \"so as to sperrit you up a little when your name\u0027s called.\" \"Sperrit him up!\" said Moulder; \"why I suppose he\u0027ll be standing in that box the best part of a day. I knowed a man was a witness; it was a case of horse-stealing; and the man who was the witness was the man who\u0027d took the horse.\" \"And he was witness against hisself!\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"No; he\u0027d paid for it. That is to say, either he had or he hadn\u0027t. That was what they wanted to get out of him, and I\u0027m blessed if he didn\u0027t take \u0027em till the judge wouldn\u0027t set there any longer. And then they hadn\u0027t got it out of him.\" \"But John Kenneby ain\u0027t one of that sort,\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"I suppose that man did not want to unbosom himself,\" said Kenneby. \"Well; no. The likes of him seldom do like to unbosom themselves,\" said Moulder. \"But that will be my desire. If they will only allow me to speak freely whatever I know about this matter, I will give them no trouble.\" \"You mean to act honest, John,\" said his sister. \"I always did, Mary Anne.\" \"Well now, I\u0027ll tell you what it is,\" said Moulder. \"As Mrs. Smiley don\u0027t like it I won\u0027t say anything more about gammon;—not just at present, that is.\" \"I\u0027ve no objection to gammon, Mr. Moulder, when properly used,\" said Mrs. Smiley, \"but I look on it as disrespectful; and seeing the position which I hold as regards John Kenneby, anything disrespectful to him is hurtful to my feelings.\" \"All right,\" said Moulder. \"And now, John, I\u0027ll just tell you what it is. You\u0027ve no more chance of being allowed to speak freely there than—than—than—no more than if you was in church. What are them fellows paid for if you\u0027re to say whatever you pleases out in your own way?\" \"He only wants to say the truth, M.,\" said Mrs. Moulder, who probably knew less than her husband of the general usages of courts of law. \"Truth be ——,\" said Moulder. \"Mr. Moulder!\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"There\u0027s ladies by, if you\u0027ll please to remember.\" \"To hear such nonsense sets one past oneself,\" continued he; \"as if all those lawyers were brought together there—the cleverest and sharpest fellows in the kingdom, mind you—to listen to a man like John here telling his own story in his own way. You\u0027ll have to tell your story in their way; that is, in two different ways. There\u0027ll be one fellow\u0027ll make you tell it his way first, and another fellow\u0027ll make you tell it again his way afterwards; and its odds but what the first \u0027ll be at you again after that, till you won\u0027t know whether you stand on your heels or your head.\" \"That can\u0027t be right,\" said Mrs. Moulder. \"And why can\u0027t it be right?\" said Moulder. \"They\u0027re paid for it; it\u0027s their duties; just as it\u0027s my duty to sell Hubbles and Grease\u0027s sugar. It\u0027s not for me to say the sugar\u0027s bad, or the samples not equal to the last. My duty is to sell, and I sell;—and it\u0027s their duty to get a verdict.\" \"But the truth, Moulder—!\" said Kenneby. \"Gammon!\" said Moulder. \"Begging your pardon, Mrs. Smiley, for making use of the expression. Look you here, John; if you\u0027re paid to bring a man off not guilty, won\u0027t you bring him off if you can? I\u0027ve been at trials times upon times, and listened till I\u0027ve wished from the bottom of my heart that I\u0027d been brought up a barrister. Not that I think much of myself, and I mean of course with education and all that accordingly. It\u0027s beautiful to hear them. You\u0027ll see a little fellow in a wig, and he\u0027ll get up; and there\u0027ll be a man in the box before him,—some swell dressed up to his eyes, who thinks no end of strong beer of himself; and in about ten minutes he\u0027ll be as flabby as wet paper, and he\u0027ll say—on his oath, mind you,—just anything that that little fellow wants him to say. That\u0027s power, mind you, and I call it beautiful.\" \"But it ain\u0027t justice,\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"Why not? I say it is justice. You can have it if you choose to pay for it, and so can I. If I buy a greatcoat against the winter, and you go out at night without having one, is it injustice because you\u0027re perished by the cold while I\u0027m as warm as a toast. I say it\u0027s a grand thing to live in a country where one can buy a greatcoat.\" The argument had got so far, Mr. Moulder certainly having the best of it, when a ring at the outer door was heard. \"Now who on earth is that?\" said Moulder. \"Snengkeld, I shouldn\u0027t wonder,\" said his wife. \"I hope it ain\u0027t no stranger,\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"Situated as John and I are now, strangers is so disagreeable.\" And then the door was opened by the maid-servant, and Mr. Kantwise was shown into the room. \"Halloo, Kantwise!\" said Mr. Moulder, not rising from his chair, or giving any very decided tokens of welcome. \"I thought you were down somewhere among the iron foundries?\" \"So I was, Mr. Moulder, but I came up yesterday. Mrs. Moulder, allow me to have the honour. I hope I see you quite well; but looking at you I need not ask. Mr. Kenneby, sir, your very humble servant. The day\u0027s coming on fast; isn\u0027t it, Mr. Kenneby? Ma\u0027am, your very obedient. I believe I haven\u0027t the pleasure of being acquainted.\" \"Mrs. Smiley, Mr. Kantwise. Mr. Kantwise, Mrs. Smiley,\" said the lady of the house, introducing her visitors to each other in the appropriate way. \"Quite delighted, I\u0027m sure,\" said Kantwise. \"Smiley as is, and Kenneby as will be this day three weeks,\" said Moulder; and then they all enjoyed that little joke, Mrs. Smiley by no means appearing bashful in the matter although Mr. Kantwise was a stranger. \"I thought I should find Mr. Kenneby here,\" said Kantwise, when the subject of the coming nuptials had been sufficiently discussed, \"and therefore I just stepped in. No intrusion, I hope, Mr. Moulder.\" \"All right,\" said Moulder; \"make yourself at home. There\u0027s the stuff on the table. You know what the tap is.\" \"I\u0027ve just parted from—Mr. Dockwrath,\" said Kantwise, speaking in a tone of voice which implied the great importance of the communication, and looking round the table to see the effect of it upon the circle. \"Then you\u0027ve parted from a very low-lived party, let me tell you that,\" said Moulder. He had not forgotten Dockwrath\u0027s conduct in the commercial room at Leeds, and was fully resolved that he never would forgive it. \"That\u0027s as may be,\" said Kantwise. \"I say nothing on that subject at the present moment, either one way or the other. But I think you\u0027ll all agree as to this: that at the present moment Mr. Dockwrath fills a conspicuous place in the public eye.\" \"By no means so conspicuous as John Kenneby,\" said Mrs. Smiley, \"if I may be allowed in my position to hold an opinion.\" \"That\u0027s as may be, ma\u0027am. I say nothing about that. What I hold by is, that Mr. Dockwrath does hold a conspicuous place in the public eye. I\u0027ve just parted with him in Gray\u0027s Inn Lane, and he says—that it\u0027s all up now with Lady Mason.\" \"Gammon!\" said Moulder. And on this occasion Mrs. Smiley did not rebuke him. \"What does he know about it more than any one else? Will he bet two to one? Because, if so, I\u0027ll take it;—only I must see the money down.\" \"I don\u0027t know what he\u0027ll bet, Mr. Moulder; only he says it\u0027s all up with her.\" \"Will he back his side, even handed?\" \"I ain\u0027t a betting man, Mr. Moulder. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s right. And on such a matter as this, touching the liberty and almost life of a lady whom I\u0027ve had the honour of seeing, and acquainted as I am with the lady of the other party, Mrs. Mason that is of Groby Park, I should rather, if it\u0027s no offence to you, decline the subject of—betting.\" \"Bother!\" \"Now M., in your own house, you know!\" said his wife. \"So it is bother. But never mind that. Go on, Kantwise. What is this you were saying about Dockwrath?\" \"Oh, that\u0027s about all. I thought you would like to know what they were doing,—particularly Mr. Kenneby. I do hear that they mean to be uncommonly hard upon him.\" The unfortunate witness shifted uneasily in his seat, but at the moment said nothing himself. \"Well, now, I can\u0027t understand it,\" said Mrs. Smiley, sitting upright in her chair, and tackling herself to the discussion as though she meant to express her opinion, let who might think differently. \"How is any one to put words into my mouth if I don\u0027t choose to speak then? There\u0027s John\u0027s waistcoat is silk.\" Upon which they all looked at Kenneby\u0027s waistcoat, and, with the exception of Kantwise, acknowledged the truth of the assertion. \"That\u0027s as may be,\" said he, looking round at it from the corner of his eyes. \"And do you mean to say that all the barristers in London will make me say that it\u0027s made of cloth? It\u0027s ridic\u0027lous—nothing short of ridic\u0027lous.\" \"You\u0027ve never tried, my dear,\" said Moulder. \"I don\u0027t know about being your dear, Mr. Moulder—\" \"Nor yet don\u0027t I neither, Mrs. Smiley,\" said the wife. \"Mr. Kenneby\u0027s my dear, and I ain\u0027t ashamed to own him,—before men and women. But if he allows hisself to be hocussed in that way, I don\u0027t know but what I shall be ashamed. I call it hocussing—just hocussing.\" \"So it is, ma\u0027am,\" said Kantwise, \"only this, you know, if I hocus you, why you hocus me in return; so it isn\u0027t so very unfair, you know.\" \"Unfair!\" said Moulder. \"It\u0027s the fairest thing that is. It\u0027s the bulwark of the British Constitution.\" \"What! being badgered and browbeat?\" asked Kenneby, who was thinking within himself that if this were so he did not care if he lived somewhere beyond the protection of that blessed ?gis. \"Trial by jury is,\" said Moulder. \"And how can you have trial by jury if the witnesses are not to be cross-questioned?\" To this position no one was at the moment ready to give an answer, and Mr. Moulder enjoyed a triumph over his audience. That he lived in a happy and blessed country Moulder was well aware, and with those blessings he did not wish any one to tamper. \"Mother,\" said a fastidious child to his parent, \"the bread is gritty and the butter tastes of turnips.\" \"Turnips indeed,—and gritty!\" said the mother. \"Is it not a great thing to have bread and butter at all?\" I own that my sympathies are with the child. Bread and butter is a great thing; but I would have it of the best if that be possible. After that Mr. Kantwise was allowed to dilate upon the subject which had brought him there. Mr. Dockwrath had been summoned to Bedford Row, and there had held a council of war together with Mr. Joseph Mason and Mr. Matthew Round. According to his own story Mr. Matthew had quite come round and been forced to acknowledge all that Dockwrath had done for the cause. In Bedford Row there was no doubt whatever as to the verdict. \"That woman Bolster is quite clear that she only signed one deed,\" said Kantwise. \"I shall say nothing—nothing here,\" said Kenneby. \"Quite right, John,\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"Your feelings on the occasion become you.\" \"I\u0027ll lay an even bet she\u0027s acquitted,\" said Moulder. \"And I\u0027ll do it in a ten-p\u0027und note.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2757/76095.html","bookId":1345,"book":{"id":1345,"title":"Orley Farm","description":"简介： It is not true that a rose by any other name will smell as sweet.
