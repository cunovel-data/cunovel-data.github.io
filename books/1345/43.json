{"id":33347,"no":43,"title":"CHAPTER XLIII. JOHN KENNEBY\u0027S COURTSHIP.","content":"\"She\u0027s as sweet a temper, John, as ever stirred a lump of sugar in her tea,\" said Mrs. Moulder to her brother, as they sat together over the fire in Great St. Helen\u0027s on that same evening,—after his return from Hamworth. \"That she is,—and so Smiley always found her. \u0027She\u0027s always the same,\u0027 Smiley said to me many a day. And what can a man want more than that?\" \"That\u0027s quite true,\" said John. \"And then as to her habits—I never knew her take a drop too much since first I set eyes on her, and that\u0027s nigh twenty years ago. She likes things comfortable;—and why shouldn\u0027t she, with two hundred a year of her own coming out of the Kingsland Road brick-fields? As for dress, her things is beautiful, and she is the woman that takes care of \u0027em! Why, I remember an Irish tabinet as Smiley gave her when first that venture in the brick-fields came up money; if that tabinet is as much as turned yet, why, I\u0027ll eat it. And then, the best of it is, she\u0027ll have you to-morrow. Indeed she will; or to-night, if you\u0027ll ask her. Goodness gracious! if there ain\u0027t Moulder!\" And the excellent wife jumped up from her seat, poked the fire, emptied the most comfortable arm-chair, and hurried out to the landing at the top of the stairs. Presently the noise of a loudly wheezing pair of lungs was heard, and the commercial traveller, enveloped from head to foot in coats and comforters, made his appearance. He had just returned from a journey, and having deposited his parcels and packages at the house of business of Hubbles and Grease in Houndsditch, had now returned to the bosom of his family. It was a way he had, not to let his wife know exactly the period of his return. Whether he thought that by so doing he might keep her always on the alert and ready for marital inspection, or whether he disliked to tie himself down by the obligation of a fixed time for his return, Mrs. Moulder had never made herself quite sure. But on neither view of the subject did she admire this practice of her lord. She had on many occasions pointed out to him how much more snug she could make him if he would only let her know when he was coming. But he had never taken the hint, and in these latter days she had ceased to give it. \"Why, I\u0027m uncommon cold,\" he said in answer to his wife\u0027s inquiries after his welfare. \"And so would you be too, if you\u0027d come up from Leeds since you\u0027d had your dinner. What, John, are you there? The two of you are making yourself snug enough, I suppose, with something hot?\" \"Not a drop he\u0027s had yet since he\u0027s been in the house,\" said Mrs. Moulder. \"And he\u0027s hardly as much as darkened the door since you left it.\" And Mrs. Moulder added, with some little hesitation in her voice, \"Mrs. Smiley is coming in to-night, Moulder.\" \"The d—— she is! There\u0027s always something of that kind when I gets home tired out, and wants to be comfortable. I mean to have my supper to myself, as I likes it, if all the Mother Smileys in London choose to come the way. What on earth is she coming here for this time of night?\" \"Why, Moulder, you know.\" \"No; I don\u0027t know. I only know this, that when a man\u0027s used up with business he don\u0027t want to have any of that nonsense under his nose.\" \"If you mean me—\" began John Kenneby. \"I don\u0027t mean you; of course not; and I don\u0027t mean anybody. Here, take my coats, will you? and let me have a pair of slippers. If Mrs. Smiley thinks that I\u0027m going to change my pants, or put myself about for her—\" \"Laws, Moulder, she don\u0027t expect that.\" \"She won\u0027t get it any way. Here\u0027s John dressed up as if he was going to a box in the the-atre. And you—why should you be going to expense, and knocking out things that costs money, because Mother Smiley\u0027s coming? I\u0027ll Smiley her.\" \"Now, Moulder—\" But Mrs. Moulder knew that it was of no use speaking to him at the present moment. Her task should be this,—to feed and cosset him if possible into good humour before her guest should arrive. Her praises of Mrs. Smiley had been very fairly true. But nevertheless she was a lady who had a mind and voice of her own, as any lady has a right to possess who draws in her own right two hundred a year out of a brick-field in the Kingsland Road. Such a one knows that she is above being snubbed, and Mrs. Smiley knew this of herself as well as any lady; and if Moulder, in his wrath, should call her Mother Smiley, or give her to understand that he regarded her as an old woman, that lady would probably walk herself off in a great dudgeon,—herself and her share in the brick-field. To tell the truth, Mrs. Smiley required that considerable deference should be paid to her. Mrs. Moulder knew well what was her husband\u0027s present ailment. He had dined as early as one, and on his journey up from Leeds to London had refreshed himself with drink only. That last glass of brandy which he had taken at the Peterborough station had made him cross. If she could get him to swallow some hot food before Mrs. Smiley came, all might yet be well. \"And what\u0027s it to be, M.?\" she said in her most insinuating voice—\"there\u0027s a lovely chop down stairs, and there\u0027s nothing so quick as that.\" \"Chop!\" he said, and it was all he did say at the moment. \"There\u0027s a \u0027am in beautiful cut,\" she went on, showing by the urgency of her voice how anxious she was on the subject. For the moment he did not answer her at all, but sat facing the fire, and running his fat fingers through his uncombed hair. \"Mrs. Smiley!\" he said; \"I remember when she was kitchen-maid at old Pott\u0027s.\" \"She ain\u0027t nobody\u0027s kitchen-maid now,\" said Mrs. Moulder, almost prepared to be angry in the defence of her friend. \"And I never could make out when it was that Smiley married her,—that is, if he ever did.\" \"Now, Moulder, that\u0027s shocking of you. Of course he married her. She and I is nearly an age as possible, though I think she is a year over me. She says not, and it ain\u0027t nothing to me. But I remember the wedding as if it was yesterday. You and I had never set eyes on each other then, M.\" This last she added in a plaintive tone, hoping to soften him. \"Are you going to keep me here all night without anything?\" he then said. \"Let me have some whisky,—hot, with;—and don\u0027t stand there looking at nothing.\" \"But you\u0027ll take some solids with it, Moulder? Why it stands to reason you\u0027ll be famished.\" \"Do as you\u0027re bid, will you, and give me the whisky. Are you going to tell me when I\u0027m to eat and when I\u0027m to drink, like a child?\" This he said in that tone of voice which made Mrs. Moulder know that he meant to be obeyed; and though she was sure that he would make himself drunk, she was compelled to minister to his desires. She got the whisky and hot water, the lemon and sugar, and set the things beside him; and then she retired to the sofa. John Kenneby the while sat perfectly silent looking on. Perhaps he was considering whether he would be able to emulate the domestic management of Dockwrath or of Moulder when he should have taken to himself Mrs. Smiley and the Kingsland brick-field. \"If you\u0027ve a mind to help yourself, John, I suppose you\u0027ll do it,\" said Moulder. \"None for me just at present, thank\u0027ee,\" said Kenneby. \"I suppose you wouldn\u0027t swallow nothing less than wine in them togs?\" said the other, raising his glass to his lips. \"Well, here\u0027s better luck, and I\u0027m blessed if it\u0027s not wanting. I\u0027m pretty well tired of this go, and so I mean to let \u0027em know pretty plainly.\" All this was understood by Mrs. Moulder, who knew that it only signified that her husband was half tipsy, and that in all probability he would be whole tipsy before long. There was no help for it. Were she to remonstrate with him in his present mood, he would very probably fling the bottle at her head. Indeed, remonstrances were never of avail with him. So she sat herself down, thinking how she would run down when she heard Mrs. Smiley\u0027s step, and beg that lady to postpone her visit. Indeed it would be well to send John to convey her home again. Moulder swallowed his glass of hot toddy fast, and then mixed another. His eyes were very bloodshot, and he sat staring at the fire. His hands were thrust into his pockets between the periods of his drinking, and he no longer spoke to any one. \"I\u0027m —— if I stand it,\" he growled forth, addressing himself. \"I\u0027ve stood it a —— deal too long.\" And then he finished the second glass. There was a sort of understanding on the part of his wife that such interjections as these referred to Hubbles and Grease, and indicated a painfully advanced state of drink. There was one hope; the double heat, that of the fire and of the whisky, might make him sleep; and if so, he would be safe for two or three hours. \"I\u0027m blessed if I do, and that\u0027s all,\" said Moulder, grasping the whisky-bottle for the third time. His wife sat behind him very anxious, but not daring to interfere. \"It\u0027s going over the table, M.,\" she then said. \"D—— the table!\" he answered; and then his head fell forward on his breast, and he was fast asleep with the bottle in his hand. \"Put your hand to it, John,\" said Mrs. Moulder in a whisper. But John hesitated. The lion might rouse himself if his prey were touched. \"He\u0027ll let it go easy if you put your hand to it. He\u0027s safe enough now. There. If we could only get him back from the fire a little, or his face\u0027ll be burnt off of him.\" \"But you wouldn\u0027t move him?\" \"Well, yes; we\u0027ll try. I\u0027ve done it before, and he\u0027s never stirred. Come here, just behind. The casters is good, I know. Laws! ain\u0027t he heavy?\" And then they slowly dragged him back. He grunted out some half-pronounced threat as they moved him; but he did not stir, and his wife knew that she was again mistress of the room for the next two hours. It was true that he snored horribly, but then she was used to that. \"You won\u0027t let her come up, will you?\" said John. \"Why not? She knows what men is as well I do. Smiley wasn\u0027t that way often, I believe; but he was awful when he was. He wouldn\u0027t sleep it off, quite innocent, like that; but would break everything about the place, and then cry like a child after it. Now Moulder\u0027s got none of that about him. The worst of it is, how am I ever to get him into bed when he wakes?\" While the anticipation of this great trouble was still on her mind, the ring at the bell was heard, and John Kenneby went down to the outer door that he might pay to Mrs. Smiley the attention of waiting upon her up stairs. And up stairs she came, bristling with silk—the identical Irish tabinet, perhaps, which had never been turned—and conscious of the business which had brought her. \"What—Moulder\u0027s asleep is he?\" she said as she entered the room. \"I suppose that\u0027s as good as a pair of gloves, any way.\" \"He ain\u0027t just very well,\" said Mrs. Moulder, winking at her friend; \"he\u0027s tired after a long journey.\" \"Oh-h! ah-h!\" said Mrs. Smiley, looking down upon the sleeping beauty, and understanding everything at a glance. \"It\u0027s uncommon bad for him, you know, because he\u0027s so given to flesh.\" \"It\u0027s as much fatigue as anything,\" said the wife. \"Yes, I dare say;\" and Mrs. Smiley shook her head. \"If he fatigues himself so much as that often he\u0027ll soon be off the hooks.\" Much was undoubtedly to be borne from two hundred a year in a brick-field, especially when that two hundred a year was coming so very near home; but there is an amount of impertinent familiarity which must be put down even in two hundred a year. \"I\u0027ve known worse cases than him, my dear; and that ended worse.\" \"Oh, I dare say. But you\u0027re mistook if you mean Smiley. It was \u0027sepilus as took him off, as everybody knows.\" \"Well, my dear, I\u0027m sure I\u0027m not going to say anything against that. And now, John, do help her off with her bonnet and shawl, while I get the tea-things.\" Mrs. Smiley was a firm set, healthy-looking woman of—about forty. She had large, dark, glassy eyes, which were bright without sparkling. Her cheeks were very red, having a fixed settled colour that never altered with circumstances. Her black wiry hair was ended in short crisp curls, which sat close to her head. It almost collected like a wig, but the hair was in truth her own. Her mouth was small, and her lips thin, and they gave to her face a look of sharpness that was not quite agreeable. Nevertheless she was not a bad-looking woman, and with such advantages as two hundred a year and the wardrobe which Mrs. Moulder had described, was no doubt entitled to look for a second husband. \"Well, Mr. Kenneby, and how do you find yourself this cold weather? Dear, how he do snore; don\u0027t he?\" \"Yes,\" said Kenneby, very thoughtfully, \"he does rather.\" He was thinking of Miriam Usbech as she was twenty years ago, and of Mrs. Smiley as she appeared at present. Not that he felt inclined to grumble at the lot prepared for him, but that he would like to take a few more years to think about it. And then they sat down to tea. The lovely chops which Moulder had despised, and the ham in beautiful cut which had failed to tempt him, now met with due appreciation. Mrs. Smiley, though she had never been known to take a drop too much, did like to have things comfortable; and on this occasion she made an excellent meal, with a large pocket-handkerchief of Moulder\u0027s—brought in for the occasion—stretched across the broad expanse of the Irish tabinet. \"We sha\u0027n\u0027t wake him, shall we?\" said she, as she took her last bit of muffin. \"Not till he wakes natural, of hisself,\" said Mrs. Moulder. \"When he\u0027s worked it off, he\u0027ll rouse himself, and I shall have to get him to bed.\" \"He\u0027ll be a bit patchy then, won\u0027t he?\" \"Well, just for a while of course he will,\" said Mrs. Moulder. \"But there\u0027s worse than him. To-morrow morning, maybe, he\u0027ll be just as sweet as sweet. It don\u0027t hang about him, sullen like. That\u0027s what I hate, when it hangs about \u0027em.\" Then the tea-things were taken away, Mrs. Smiley in her familiarity assisting in the removal, and—in spite of the example now before them—some more sugar and some more spirits, and some more hot water were put upon the table. \"Well, I don\u0027t mind just the least taste in life, Mrs. Moulder, as we\u0027re quite between friends; and I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll want it to-night to keep yourself up.\" Mrs. Moulder would have answered these last words with some severity had she not felt that good humour now might be of great value to her brother. \"Well, John, and what is it you\u0027ve got to say to her?\" said Mrs. Moulder, as she put down her empty glass. Between friends who understood each other so well, and at their time of life, what was the use of ceremony? \"La, Mrs. Moulder, what should he have got to say? Nothing I\u0027m sure as I\u0027d think of listening to.\" \"You try her, John.\" \"Not but what I\u0027ve the greatest respect in life for Mr. Kenneby, and always did have. If you must have anything to do with men, I\u0027ve always said, recommend me to them as is quiet and steady, and hasn\u0027t got too much of the gab;—a quiet man is the man for me any day.\" \"Well, John?\" said Mrs. Moulder. \"Now, Mrs. Moulder, can\u0027t you keep yourself to yourself, and we shall do very well. Laws, how he do snore! When his head goes bobbing that way I do so fear he\u0027ll have a fit.\" \"No he won\u0027t; he\u0027s coming to, all right. Well, John?\" \"I\u0027m sure I shall be very happy,\" said John, \"if she likes it. She says that she respects me, and I\u0027m sure I\u0027ve a great respect for her. I always had—even when Mr. Smiley was alive.\" \"It\u0027s very good of you to say so,\" said she; not speaking however as though she were quite satisfied. What was the use of his remembering Smiley just at present? \"Enough\u0027s enough between friends any day,\" said Mrs. Moulder. \"So give her your hand, John.\" \"I think it\u0027ll be right to say one thing first,\" said Kenneby, with a solemn and deliberate tone. \"And what\u0027s that?\" said Mrs. Smiley, eagerly. \"In such a matter as this,\" continued Kenneby, \"where the hearts are concerned—\" \"You didn\u0027t say anything about hearts yet,\" said Mrs. Smiley, with some measure of approbation in her voice. \"Didn\u0027t I?\" said Kenneby. \"Then it was an omission on my part, and I beg leave to apologise. But what I was going to say is this: when the hearts are concerned, everything should be honest and above-board.\" \"Oh of course,\" said Mrs. Moulder; \"and I\u0027m sure she don\u0027t suspect nothing else.\" \"You\u0027d better let him go on,\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"My heart has not been free from woman\u0027s lovely image.\" \"And isn\u0027t free now, is it, John?\" said Mrs. Moulder. \"I\u0027ve had my object, and though she\u0027s been another\u0027s, still I\u0027ve kept her image on my heart.\" \"But it ain\u0027t there any longer, John? He\u0027s speaking of twenty years ago, Mrs. Smiley.\" \"It\u0027s quite beautiful to hear him,\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"Go on, Mr. Kenneby.\" \"The years are gone by as though they was nothing, and still I\u0027ve had her image on my heart. I\u0027ve seen her to-day.\" \"Her gentleman\u0027s still alive, ain\u0027t he?\" asked Mrs. Smiley. \"And likely to live,\" said Mrs. Moulder. \"I\u0027ve seen her to-day,\" Kenneby continued; \"and now the Adriatic\u0027s free to wed another.\" Neither of the ladies present exactly understood the force of the quotation; but as it contained an appropriate reference to marriage, and apparently to a second marriage, it was taken by both of them in good part. He was considered to have made his offer, and Mrs. Smiley thereupon formally accepted him. \"He\u0027s spoke quite handsome, I\u0027m sure,\" said Mrs. Smiley to his sister; \"and I don\u0027t know that any woman has a right to expect more. As to the brick-fields—.\" And then there was a slight reference to business, with which it will not be necessary that the readers of this story should embarrass themselves. Soon after that Mr. Kenneby saw Mrs. Smiley home in a cab, and poor Mrs. Moulder sat by her lord till he roused himself from his sleep. Let us hope that her troubles with him were as little vexatious as possible; and console ourselves with the reflection that at twelve o\u0027clock the next morning, after the second bottle of soda and brandy, he was \"as sweet as sweet.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2757/76076.html","bookId":1345,"book":{"id":1345,"title":"Orley Farm","description":"简介： It is not true that a rose by any other name will smell as sweet.
