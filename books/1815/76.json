And it makes no sense why you’d be okay with the first one and have a problem with the second one.”\n I glared. “Because one is a business transaction in a controlled environment. The other is a last hurrah for sport fucking in the one of the sexiest cities in the world!”\n “You know better.” His voice was low and smooth, easy. Which meant it was dangerous.\n “I’m not worried about you,” I stressed. “It’s the women who’ll want you. And your friends, who’ll get drunk and horny and want you to play, too.”\n His face was impassive, his gaze cool. “And you think I’m not strong enough to handle the peer pressure?”\n “I didn’t say that. Don’t put words in my mouth.”\n “I’m just trying to clarify your convoluted thinking.”\n “Look. Let’s get back to the Deanna scenario.” I wriggled away and stood. Facing the coffee table, I stretched out my hands, directing. “This is how I pictured it before I made the suggestion. You in your office, leaning back against your desk in that way you do that’s sexy as hell. Jacket on the coatrack, maybe a scotch on the rocks next to your hand for an informal touch.”\n I faced the couch. “Deanna’s in the chair farthest from you, so she can get the full picture. You give her a slow once-over, say a few double entendres about getting things done together. She gets ideas and seals the deal with a signature on the dotted line. That’s it. You never get closer than a few feet from her and you never sit down. The glass wall stays clear, so she won’t make a move.”\n “You imagined all this in a split second?”\n “Well”—I tapped my temple—“I have some memories rattling around up here that fueled the fire.”\n “My memories of seduction in my office don’t include anyone else,” he said dryly.\n “Listen, ace.” I sat on the coffee table. “It was a spontaneous thought that came to me because I was worried about you.”\n Gideon’s face softened. “Angels rush in. I get it.”\n “Do you?” Leaning forward, I put my hands on his knees. “I’m always going to be possessive, Gideon. You’re mine. I wish I could put a sign on you that says it.”\n He held up his left hand, showing off his wedding band.\n I scoffed. “You know how many women are going to pay attention to that when you’re trolling through Rio with your crew?”\n “They’ll pay attention when I point it out.”\n “Then one of the guys will let slip that it’s a bachelor party and they’ll just try harder.”\n “Trying won’t get them anywhere.”\n My gaze ran over him. “You’ll be irresistible in graphite gray dress slacks and a black V-neck shirt—”\n “You’re remembering that night at the club.”\n He obviously did, too. His cock thickened and lengthened, tenting his sweatpants obscenely.\n I almost moaned as his arousal proved what I’d suspected: He was commando beneath the soft cotton.\n “I couldn’t stop thinking about you after you left my office,” he murmured. “Couldn’t get the vision of you out of my mind. Then I called you at work and you taunted me, telling me you were going home to play with your vibrator when my cock was hard and ready for you.”\n I squirmed, recalling every detail. He had been wearing a V-neck sweater that night in New York, but what I imagined him wearing in Rio made allowances for the tropical climate and the steamy press of bodies in a nightclub.\n “In my mind, I saw you on your bed,” he went on, reaching between his legs to stroke his erection through his pants. “Your legs spread. Your back arching. Your body naked and shiny with sweat as you pushed a thick plastic cock in and out of your creamy cunt. I was half crazed with the idea of it. I’d never felt lust like that. It felt like I was in heat. The need to fuck was a fever inside me.”\n “God, Gideon.” My sex ached. My breasts felt swollen and tender, the nipples tight and sore.\n He watched me, his eyes hooded. “I went out before I arranged to meet you. I was going to find someone who wouldn’t say no like you did. I was going to take her to the hotel, spread her out, fuck her until the madness went away. Who she was didn’t matter. She was going to be faceless, nameless. I wasn’t going to look at her while I was inside her. She was just a stand-in for you.”\n A low sound of pain left me, the thought of him with someone else in that way too agonizing to bear. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-with-you-crossfire-5/page-76.html","bookId":1815,"book":{"id":1815,"title":"One with You (Crossfire #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Gideon Cross.
