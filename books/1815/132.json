Why do you have this?”\\n\\n “There was a time, a couple months ago,” Gideon said tonelessly, resuming his seat beside me, “when Corinne became erratic. I discovered she’d been seeing a therapist who prescribed antidepressants, which were causing her mood swings. I took a picture of the label so I’d know who to contact if she continued having problems.”\\n\\n Gideon put his arm around me, urging me to lean into him. The moment I was pressed against him, I felt him sag heavily into the chair, as if holding me was a major relief. I slid my arm around his waist, felt his lips press against my forehead.\\n\\n His chest rumbled beneath my ear as he spoke. “So Anne was Hall’s therapist,” he said, his voice rough with fatigue. “Why the alias?”\\n\\n “She thought she was smart,” Grave said bluntly. “We’re smarter. And we have Hall, who is very disturbed but also very cooperative. He confessed the minute we sat down with him. He was also clever—or paranoid—enough to secretly record all of his sessions with Dr. Lucas, which we recovered during a search of his vehicle.”\\n\\n “Did she put him up to this?” I asked, wanting to be sure there was no misunderstanding.\\n\\n “I don’t think Hall was ever playing with a full deck,” Michna said, “but he used to have a job, a place to live, and no particular interest in Cross. Anne Lucas did a number on him.”\\n\\n Graves started gathering up the photos with the help of her partner. “He mentioned to her that he dropped out of school after the Cross Ponzi scheme wiped out his grandparents. It wasn’t something he held a grudge over, but she got him thinking that his life and Cross’s are paralleled in some way.”\\n\\n “Can she go to jail for that?” I hung on tighter to Gideon. “What she did—that’s part of the reason my mom’s … gone. She can’t just get away with that, right?”\\n\\n “We picked her up about an hour ago.” Graves held my gaze and I saw her determination. “When her lawyer shows up, we’ll take a crack at her.”\\n\\n “The DA’s office will determine the full extent of the charges,” Michna said, “but Hall’s recordings, plus security footage of both Lucas and Hall entering and leaving her secondary office, gave us probable cause.”\\n\\n “You’ll keep us posted,” my father said.\\n\\n “Of course.” Graves tucked everything back in her satchel, then shot a look at Gideon. “Did you see Dr. Lucas at the dinner?”\\n\\n “Yes,” he answered, his hand stroking up and down my arm. “Eva pointed her out to me.”\\n\\n “Did either of you speak with her at all?” Michna asked.\\n\\n “No.” Gideon looked down at me with a question in his eyes.\\n\\n “I flipped her the bird from a distance,” I confessed, the memory of her drifting through my blurry mind. “She had this smirk on her face. Maybe that’s why she was there, so she could see what happened.”\\n\\n “Angel.” Gideon enfolded me, wrapping me into his warmth and the scent of his skin.\\n\\n “All right. We’ve got what we need for now,” Graves said briskly. “We’ll just take Mr. McLeod’s statement regarding the Westport incident and be on our way. Thank you for your time.”\\n\\n Dismissed, we all pushed back from the table.\\n\\n “Eva.” Graves waited until our gazes met. For a moment, she wasn’t just a cop. “I’m very sorry for your loss.”\\n\\n “Thank you.” Self-conscious, I looked away from Graves.\\n\\n Did she wonder at my dry eyes? God knew I did. As crazy as my mother drove me at times, I loved her. Didn’t I? What kind of daughter didn’t feel anything when her mom died?\\n\\n Angus took Gideon’s abandoned chair and began recounting what had happened in Westport.\\n\\n Gideon took my hand and led me a few feet away. “I need some time with you.”\\n\\n Frowning, I nodded. “Yeah, of course.”\\n\\n He drew me along with him toward our bedroom.\\n\\n “Cross.”\\n\\n We both turned at the sound of my father’s voice. “Yes?”\\n\\n Dad stood by the living room, his face hard and his gaze heated. “We have to talk.”\\n\\n “Agreed,” Gideon said with a nod. “Just give me five minutes with my wife.”\\n\\n He kept going, not giving my dad a chance to object. I followed along to our bedroom, Lucky racing ahead of us. I watched Gideon as he shut the door with the three of us inside. Then he faced me, his gaze searching. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-with-you-crossfire-5/page-132.html","bookId":1815,"book":{"id":1815,"title":"One with You (Crossfire #5)","description":"Storyline: Gideon Cross.
