{"id":85190,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"Then … the truth came easier than it ever had. I’d been hiding so many things from the people I loved. Little things, big things. Trying to maintain the status quo, while also hoping for and needing change.\n “I was afraid,” I told him.\n He stepped closer, his gaze intense. “And now you’re not.”\n “No.”\n “You’ll tell me why tonight.”\n I nodded. “I’ll tell you.”\n His hand curved around my nape, the hold possessive and tender at once. His face was impassive, giving nothing away, but his eyes … those blue, blue eyes … they raged with emotion. “We’re going to make it, angel.”\n Love slid warmly through me like the buzz of a fine wine. “Damn straight.”\n It was strange walking through the doors of Waters Field \u0026 Leaman, mentally counting down the number of days I’d be able to claim I worked at the prestigious advertising agency. Megumi Kaba waved from behind her reception desk, tapping her headset to let me know she was on a call and couldn’t talk. I waved back and headed toward my own desk with a determined stride. I had a lot to get done, a new start to get rolling.\n But first things first. I dropped my purse and bag into the bottom drawer, then settled in my chair and surfed to my usual florist’s website. I knew what I wanted. Two dozen white roses in a deep red crystal vase.\n White for purity. For friendship. For eternal love. It was also the flag of surrender. I’d drawn battle lines by forcing a separation between Gideon and me, and in the end, I had won. But I didn’t want to war with my husband.\n I didn’t even try to come up with a clever tie-in note for the flowers, like I’d done in the past. I just wrote from the heart.\n You are miraculous, Mr. Cross.\n I cherish you and love you so much.\n Mrs. Cross\n The website prompted me to finalize the order. I clicked submit and took a moment to imagine what Gideon would think of my gift. One day, I hoped to watch him receive flowers from me. Did he smile when his secretary, Scott, brought them in? Did he stop whatever meeting he was commanding to read my notes? Or did he wait until one of the rare lulls in his schedule for privacy?\n My mouth curved as I considered the possibilities. I loved giving Gideon gifts.\n And soon I’d have more time to pick them out.\n “You’re quitting?”\n Mark Garrity’s incredulous gaze lifted from my resignation letter and met mine.\n My stomach knotted at the expression on my boss’s face. “Yes. I’m sorry I can’t give more notice.”\n “Tomorrow is your last day?” He leaned back in his chair. His eyes were a warm chocolate shades lighter than his skin, and they registered both surprise and dismay. “Why, Eva?”\n Sighing, I leaned forward, setting my elbows on my knees. Yet again, I went with the truth. “I know it’s unprofessional to cut out like this, but … I’ve got to rearrange my priorities and right now …. I just can’t give this my full attention, Mark. I’m sorry.”\n “I …” He blew out his breath and ran a hand over his dark, tight curls. “Hell … What can I say?”\n “That you’ll forgive me and won’t hold it against me?” I huffed out a humorless laugh. “It’s asking a lot, I know.”\n He managed a wry smile. “I hate to lose you, Eva, you know that. I’m not sure I’ve ever really expressed how much you’ve contributed. You make me work better.”\n “Thank you, Mark. I appreciate that.” God, this was harder than I thought it would be, even knowing it was the best and only decision I could make.\n My gaze went beyond my handsome boss to the view behind him. As a junior account manager, he had a small office and his view was blocked by the building across the street, but it was still as quintessentially New York as Gideon Cross’s sprawling office on the top floor above us.\n In a lot of ways, that division of floors mirrored the way I’d tried to define my relationship with Gideon. I knew who he was. Knew what he was: a man in a class by himself. I loved that about him and didn’t want him to change; I just wanted to climb to his level on my own merits. What I hadn’t considered was that by stubbornly refusing to accept that our marriage changed the plan, I was pulling him down to mine.\n I wouldn’t be known for earning my way to the top of my field. For some people, I would always have married into success. And I was just going to have to live with it.\n “So, where are you going from here?” Mark asked.\n “Honestly … I’m still figuring that out. I just know I can’t stay.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-with-you-crossfire-5/page-5.html","bookId":1815,"book":{"id":1815,"title":"One with You (Crossfire #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Gideon Cross.
