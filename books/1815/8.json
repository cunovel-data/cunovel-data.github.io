How did you know?”\n “I came to thank you for the flowers,” he murmured.\n “Oh. Do you like them?” I managed a smile. “I wanted to make you think of me.”\n “All the time. Every minute.” He caught my hips and tugged me closer.\n “You could’ve just sent a note.”\n “Ah.” His ghost of a smile made my pulse skip. “But that wouldn’t cover this.”\n Gideon pulled me into his lap and kissed me senseless.\n We still heading home tonight? Cary texted as I waited for the elevator to take me back down to the lobby at noon. My mom was already waiting for me there and I was trying to pull my thoughts together. We had a lot of ground to cover.\n God, I was hoping she could help me deal with it all.\n That’s the plan, I replied to my beloved pain-in-the-ass-sometimes roommate, typing as I stepped into the car. I have an appt. after work, though, then dinner with Gideon. Might be late.\n Dinner? U have to catch me up.\n I smiled. Of course.\n Trey called.\n I exhaled in a rush, as if I’d been holding my breath. I guess in a way I had been.\n I couldn’t blame Cary’s on-again, off-again boyfriend for taking a big step back when he’d learned that Cary’s booty-call girl was pregnant. Trey had already been struggling with Cary’s bisexuality, and now a baby meant there would always be a third person in their relationship.\n There was no question that Cary should have committed to Trey sooner, instead of keeping his options open, but I understood the fear behind Cary’s actions. I knew all too well the thoughts that ran through your mind when you’d survived the things Cary and I had, yet still somehow found yourself faced with an amazing person who loved you.\n When it was too good to be true, how could it possibly be real?\n I sympathized with Trey, too, and if he called it quits, I’d respect that decision. But he was the best thing to happen to Cary in a long time. I was going to be extremely bummed if they didn’t make it. What did he say?\n I’ll tell u when I see u.\n Cary! That’s cruel.\n It took him until I was walking through the lobby turnstiles to reply. Yeah, tell me about it.\n My heart sank, because there was no way to interpret that as good news. Stepping aside to allow others to pass me, I typed back, I love you madly, Cary Taylor.\n Love u 2, baby girl.\n “Eva!”\n My mother crossed the space between us on delicately heeled sandals, a woman impossible to miss even amid the lunchtime crush of people heading in and out of the Crossfire. As petite as she was, Monica Stanton should’ve been lost in the sea of suits, but she drew too much attention for that to ever happen.\n Charisma. Sensuality. Fragility. It was the bombshell combination that made Marilyn Monroe a star, and it exemplified my mother. Dressed in a navy blue sleeveless jumpsuit, Monica Stanton looked younger than her years and more confident than I knew her to be. The Cartier panthers hugging her throat and wrist told the observant she was expensive.\n She came straight to me and wrapped me in a hug that took me by surprise.\n “Mom.”\n “Are you okay?” Pulling back, she studied my face.\n “What? Yes. Why?”\n “Your father called.”\n “Oh.” I looked at her warily. “He didn’t take the news well.”\n “No, he didn’t.” As she linked her arm with mine, we headed out. “But he’s dealing with it. He wasn’t quite ready to let you go.”\n “Because I remind him of you.” To my father, my mom was the one who got away. He still loved her, even after more than two decades apart.\n “Nonsense, Eva. There’s a resemblance, but you’re much more interesting.”\n That startled a laugh from me. “Gideon says I’m interesting.”\n She smiled brightly, making the man passing her stumble over his own feet. “Of course. He’s a connoisseur of women. As gorgeous as you are, it would take more than beauty to get him to marry you.”\n Slowing to a halt by the revolving doors, I let my mother go out first. A blast of muggy heat hit me when I joined her on the sidewalk, bringing an instant mist of perspiration to my skin. There were times when I doubted I’d ever get used to the humidity, but I considered it one of the costs of living in the city I loved so much. Spring had been beautiful and I knew fall would be, too. The perfect time of year to renew my vows with the man who owned me heart and soul. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-with-you-crossfire-5/page-8.html","bookId":1815,"book":{"id":1815,"title":"One with You (Crossfire #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Gideon Cross.
