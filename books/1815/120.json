I pulled her up tight against me, cradling her close. “Thank God.”\n Raúl barked orders into the mic at his wrist. The moment he shut up, I demanded, “What the fuck happened?”\n He dropped his arm. “One of the photographers had a gun and opened fire. Clancy got him.”\n “Was anyone hurt?”\n “Monica Stanton went down.”\n “What?” My slowing heartbeat lurched back into a pounding rhythm. I looked down at my wife as she slowly came to¸ her eyelids fluttering. “Jesus. How bad?”\n He exhaled harshly. “I’m waiting for word. It didn’t look good. You grabbed Mrs. Cross and Mrs. Stanton moved into the way.”\n Eva.\n I held my wife tighter, running my hand over her hair as we sped through the city.\n “What happened?”\n Eva’s soft question as we turned the corner that led to the garage knotted my stomach. Raúl looked at me, his face grim. Only moments before he’d taken a call and met my gaze, confirming my worst fear with a shake of his head and a quietly voiced I’m sorry.\n My wife’s mother was dead.\n How was I supposed to tell Eva? And after I did, how could I keep her safe until we knew what the hell was going on?\n In my jacket pocket, my phone buzzed constantly. Calls. Messages. I needed to get to them all, but my wife came first.\n We pulled into the garage, driving past the guard in the glass cubicle. My foot tapped restlessly on the floorboard. I wanted out of the car. I needed my wife locked down.\n “Gideon?” She clutched at my jacket. “What happened? I heard gunshots—”\n “False alarm,” I said gruffly, my grip on her too tight. “A car backfired.”\n “What? Really?” She blinked up at me, wincing as I pulled her even closer. “Oww.”\n “I’m sorry.” I’d taken her down hard, unable to break the fall for her without exposing her to danger. It had been instinctual, an abrupt response to the urgency in Raúl’s voice. “I overreacted.”\n “For real?” She tried to sit up. “I thought I heard multiple shots.”\n “The death of a few cameras, maybe. A few people got startled, dropped their gear.”\n The car slowed to a halt and Raúl leapt out, extending his hand to Eva to help her. She climbed out slowly and I was directly behind her, scooping her up into my arms the moment I straightened.\n I strode to the garage elevator, waited while Raúl typed in the code. One of his team stood behind us, facing the other direction, his hand in his jacket on his gun as he surveilled.\n Would he be enough if there was another shooter lying in wait?\n “Hey, I can walk,” Eva said, still punchy, her arms around my shoulders. “And you need to answer your phone. That thing’s going crazy.”\n “Give me a minute.” I stepped into the elevator. “You passed out. Scared the shit out of me.”\n “I couldn’t breathe.”\n Kissing her forehead, I apologized again. I wouldn’t feel safe until we stepped into our living room. I glanced at Raúl. “I’ll be out shortly.”\n I took my wife directly to the bedroom, laying her down atop the comforter. Lucky barked in his crate, pawing at the door.\n “That was so weird.” Eva shook her head. “Where’s my clutch? I want to call Mom. Did Clancy freak out, too?”\n My gut knotted. I’d promised to never lie to my wife and I knew this lie was going to hurt her badly. Hurt us. But … God. How the fuck did I tell her? And if I did, how could I keep her home when she’d want to go out and see the truth for herself ?\n Lucky’s plaintive whines only ratcheted up my anxiety.\n “I think we left your purse in the car.” I brushed the hair back from her forehead, fighting the tremor that wanted to rack my entire body. “I’ll have someone get it and bring it up.”\n “Okay. Can I use your phone for now?”\n “Let’s get you settled first. Are you hurting? Bruised?” I shot a glare at Lucky, but that only made him paw the metal bars more furiously.\n She poked at her hip and winced. “Maybe.”\n “All right. We’ll take care of that.”\n I went to the bathroom, pulling out my phone to turn it off. The screen was an endless scroll of missed calls and texts. I watched it go black, shoved it into my pants pocket, and then turned on the taps in the bathtub. Anyone I’d want to hear from could reach Raúl or Angus.\n I tossed a handful of Epsom salts into the steaming water; I knew a bath was a risk considering how rare it was for me to not join Eva when she took one. Still, hot soaks relaxed her, made her calm. I suspected she took naps during the day to make up for the hours our sex life took out of the nights, but she was running a sleep deficit after the weekend. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-with-you-crossfire-5/page-120.html","bookId":1815,"book":{"id":1815,"title":"One with You (Crossfire #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Gideon Cross.
