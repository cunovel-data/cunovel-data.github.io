{"id":65905,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"EIGHT MINUTES LATER he heard a key in the lock and looked up and expected to see Poulton at the door. But it wasn\u0027t Poulton. It was a woman. She looked about sixteen. She had long fair hair in a loose ponytail. White teeth in an open, tanned face. Bright blue eyes. She was wearing a man\u0027s suit, extensively tailored to fit. A white shirt and a tie. Small black shoes with low heels. She was over six feet tall, long-limbed, and very slim. And completely spectacular. And she was smiling at him.\n \"Hi,\" she said.\n Reacher made no reply. Just stared at her. Her face clouded and her smile turned a little embarrassed.\n \"So you want to do the FAQs right away?\"\n \"The what?\" \"The FAQs. Frequently asked questions.\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure I have any questions.\"\n \"Oh, OK.\"\n She smiled again, relieved. It gave her a frank, guileless look.\n \"What are the frequently asked questions?\" he asked.\n \"Oh, you know, the stuff most new guys around here ask me. It\u0027s really, really tedious.\"\n She meant it. He could see that. But he asked anyway.\n \"What kind of stuff?\" he said.\n She made a face, resigned.\n \"I\u0027m Lisa Harper,\" she said. \"I\u0027m twenty-nine, yes really, I\u0027m from Aspen, Colorado, I\u0027m six feet one, yes really, I\u0027ve been at Quantico two years, yes I date guys, no I dress like this just because I like it, no I\u0027m not married, no I don\u0027t currently have a boyfriend, and no I don\u0027t want to have dinner with you tonight.\"\n She finished with another smile and he smiled back.\n \"Well, how about tomorrow night?\" he said.\n She shook her head. \"All you need to know is I\u0027m an FBI agent, on duty.\"\n \"Doing what?\"\n \"Watching you,\" she said. \"Where you go, I go. You\u0027re classified SU, status unknown, maybe friendly, maybe hostile. Usually that means an organized-crime plea bargain, you know, some guy ratting out his bosses. Useful to us, but not reliable.\"\n \"I\u0027m not organized crime.\"\n \"Our file says you might be.\"\n \"Then the file is bullshit.\"\n She nodded, and smiled again. \"I looked Petrosian up separately. He\u0027s a Syrian. Therefore his rivals are Chinese. And they never employ anybody except other Chinese. Implausible they\u0027d use an American WASP like you.\"\n \"You point that out to anybody?\"\n \"I\u0027m sure they already know. They\u0027re just trying to get you to take the threat seriously.\"\n \"Should I take it seriously?\"\n She nodded. Stopped smiling.\n \"Yes, you should,\" she said. \"You should think very carefully about Jodie.\"\n \"Jodie\u0027s in the file?\"\n She nodded again. \"Everything\u0027s in the file.\"\n \"So why don\u0027t I have a handle on my door? My file shows I\u0027m not the guy.\"\n \"Because we\u0027re very cautious and your profile is very bad. The guy will turn out to be very similar to you.\"\n \"You a profiler too?\"\n She shook her head. The ponytail moved with it. \"No, I\u0027m operational. Assigned for the duration. But I listen carefully. Listen and learn, right? So let\u0027s go.\"\n She held the door. It closed softly behind him as they walked to a different elevator. This one had buttons for five basement floors in a line beneath 3, 2, and 1. Lisa Harper pressed the bottom button. Reacher stood beside her and tried not to breathe in her scent. The elevator settled with a bump and the door slid back on a gray corridor bright with fluorescent light.\n \"We call this the Bunker,\" Harper said. \"It used to be our nuclear shelter. Now it\u0027s BS.\"\n \"That\u0027s for damn sure,\" Reacher said.\n \"Behavioral Science. And that\u0027s a very old joke.\"\n She led him to the right. The corridor was narrow, and clean, but not public-area clean. It was a working place. It smelled faintly of sweat and old coffee and office chemicals. There were notice boards on the walls and random stacks of stationery cartons in the corners. There was a line of doors in the left-hand wall.\n \"Here,\" Harper said.\n She stopped him in front of a door with a number on it and reached across him and knocked. Then she used the handle and opened it up for him.\n \"I\u0027ll be right outside,\" she said.\n He went in and saw Nelson Blake behind a crowded desk in a small untidy office. There were maps and photographs taped carefully to the walls. Piles of paper everywhere. No visitor chair. Blake was glowering. His face was red with blood pressure and pale with strain, all at the same time. He was watching a muted television set. It was tuned to a political cable channel. A guy in shirtsleeves was reading something to a committee. The caption read Director of the FBI.\n \"Budget hearings,\" Blake muttered. \"Singing for our damn supper.\"\n Reacher said nothing. Blake kept his eyes on the television.\n \"Case conference in two minutes,\" he said. \"So listen up for the rules. Consider yourself somewhere between a guest and a prisoner here, OK?\"\n Reacher nodded. \"Harper already explained that.\"\n \"Right. She stays with you, all the time. Everything you do, everywhere you go, you\u0027re supervised by her. But don\u0027t get the wrong idea. You\u0027re still Lamarr\u0027s boy, only she stays here, because she won\u0027t fly. And you\u0027ll need to get around some. Whereupon we need to keep an eye on you, so Harper goes too. The only time you\u0027re alone is when you\u0027re locked in your room. Your duties are what Lamarr tells you they are. You wear your ID at all times.\"\n \"OK.\"\n \"And don\u0027t get ideas about Harper. Thing with her is, she looks nice, but you start messing with her, then she\u0027s the bitch from hell, OK?\"\n \"OK.\"\n \"Anything else?\"\n \"Is my phone tapped?\"\n \"Of course it is.\" Blake riffed through papers. Slid a thick finger down a printout. \"You just called your girlfriend, private office line, apartment, mobile. No answer. \"\n \"Where is she?\"\n Blake shrugged. \"Hell should I know?\"\n Then he scrabbled in the pile of paper on his desk and came up with a large brown envelope. Held it out.\n \"With Cozo\u0027s compliments,\" he said.\n Reacher took the envelope. It was stiff and heavy. It contained photographs. Eight of them. They were color glossies, eight by ten. Crime scene photographs. They looked like stuff from a cheap skin magazine, except the women were all dead. The corpses were displayed in limp imitations of centerfolds. They were mutilated. Pieces were missing. Things had been inserted into them, here and there.\n \"Petrosian\u0027s handiwork,\" Blake said. \"Wives and sisters and daughters of people who pissed him off.\"\n \"So how come he\u0027s still running around?\"\n There was silence for a second.\n \"There\u0027s proof, and then there\u0027s proof, right?\" Blake said.\n Reacher nodded. \"So where\u0027s Jodie?\"\n \"Hell should I know?\" Blake said again. \"We\u0027ve got no interest in her as long as you play ball. We\u0027re not tailing her. Petrosian can find her himself, if it comes to that. We\u0027re not going to deliver her to him. That would be illegal, right?\"\n \"So would breaking your neck.\"\n Blake nodded. \"Stop with the threats, OK? You\u0027re in no position.\"\n \"I know this whole thing was your idea.\"\n Blake shook his head. \"I\u0027m not worried about you, Reacher. Deep down, you think you\u0027re a good person. You\u0027ll help me, and then you\u0027ll forget all about me.\"\n Reacher smiled. \"I thought you profilers were supposed to be real insightful.\"\n THREE WEEKS IS a nice complicated interval, which is exactly why you chose it. It has no obvious significance. They\u0027ll drive themselves mad, trying to understand a three-week interval. They\u0027ll have to dig real, real deep before they see what you\u0027re doing. Too deep to be feasible. The closer they get to it, the less it will mean. The interval leads nowhere. So the interval makes you safe.\n But does it have to be maintained? Maybe. A pattern is a pattern. It ought to be a very strict thing. Very precise. Because that\u0027s what they\u0027re expecting. Strict adherence to a pattern. It\u0027s typical in this sort of case. The pattern protects you. It\u0027s important. So it should be maintained. But then again, maybe it shouldn\u0027t. Three weeks is a pretty long interval. And pretty boring. So maybe you should speed it up. But anything less would be very tight, given the work required. Soon as one was done, the next would have to be prepared. A treadmill. Difficult work, on a tight schedule. Not everybody could do it. But you could.\n THE CASE CONFERENCE was held in a long low room a floor above Blake\u0027s office. There was light brown fabric on the walls, worn shiny where people had leaned on it or brushed against it. One long wall had four recesses let into it, with blinds and concealed lighting simulating windows, even though the room was four stories underground. There was a silent television mounted high on the wall, with the budget hearings playing to nobody. There was a long table made of expensive wood, surrounded by cheap chairs set at forty-five degree angles so they faced the head of the table, where there was a large empty blackboard set against the end wall. The blackboard was modern, like it came from a well-endowed college. The whole place was airless and quiet and isolated, like a place where serious work was done, like a postgraduate seminar room.\n Harper led Reacher to a seat at the far end from the blackboard. The back of the class. She sat one place nearer the action, so he had to look past her shoulder. Blake took the chair nearest the board. Poulton and Lamarr came in together, carrying files, absorbed in low conversation. Neither of them glanced anywhere except at Blake. He waited until the door closed behind them and then stood up and flipped the blackboard over.\n The top right quarter was occupied by a large map of the United States, dotted with a forest of flags. Ninety-one of them, Reacher guessed, without trying to count them all. Most of them were red, but three of them were black. Opposite the map on the left was an eight-by-ten color photograph, cropped and blown up from a casual snapshot taken through a cheap lens onto grainy film. It showed a woman, squinting against the sun and smiling. She was in her twenties, and pretty, a plump happy face framed by curly brown hair.\n \"Lorraine Stanley, ladies and gentlemen,\" Blake said. \"Recently deceased in San Diego, California.\"\n Underneath the smiling face were more eight-by-tens pinned up in a careful sequence. The crime scene. They were crisper photographs. Professional. There was a long shot of a small Spanish-style bungalow, taken from the street. A close-up of the front door. Wide shots of a hallway, a living room, the master bedroom. The master bathroom. The back wall was all mirror above twin sinks. The photographer was reflected in the mirror, a large person bundled into a white nylon coverall, a shower cap on his head, latex gloves on his hands, a camera at his eye, the bright halo of the strobe caught by the mirror. There was a shower stall on the right, and a tub on the left. The tub was low, with a wide lip. It was full of green paint.\n \"She was alive three days ago,\" Blake said. \"Neighbor saw her wheeling her garbage to the curb, eight forty-five in the morning, local time. She was discovered yesterday, by her cleaner.\"\n \"We got a time of death?\" Lamarr asked.\n \"Approximate,\" Blake said. \"Sometime during the second day.\"\n \"Neighbors see anything?\"\n Blake shook his head. \"She took her garbage can back inside, the same day. Nobody saw anything after that.\"\n \"MO?\"\n \"Exactly identical to the first two.\"\n \"Evidence?\"\n \"Not a damn thing, so far. They\u0027re still looking, but I\u0027m not optimistic.\"\n Reacher was focusing on the picture of the hallway. It was a long narrow space leading past the mouth of the living room, back to the bedrooms. On the left was a narrow shelf at waist height, crowded with tiny cactus plants in tiny terra-cotta pots. On the right were more narrow shelves, fixed to the wall at random heights and in random lengths. They were packed with small china ornaments. Most of them looked like dolls, brightly painted to represent national or regional costumes. The sort of things a person buys when she\u0027s dreaming of having a home of her own.\n \"What did the cleaner do?\" he asked.\n Blake looked all the way down the table. \"Screamed a bit, I guess, and then called the cops.\"\n \"No, before that. She has her own key?\"\n \"Obviously.\"\n \"Did she go straight to the bathroom?\"\n Blake looked blank and opened a file. Leafed through it and found a faxed copy of an interview report. \"Yes, she did. She puts stuff in the toilet bowl, leaves it to work while she does the rest of the house, comes back to it last.\"\n \"So she found the body right away, before she did any cleaning?\"\n Blake nodded.\n \"OK,\" Reacher said.\n \"OK what?\"\n \"How wide is that hallway?\"\n Blake turned and examined the picture. \"Three feet? It\u0027s a small house.\"\n Reacher nodded. \"OK.\"\n \"OK what?\"\n \"Where\u0027s the violence? Where\u0027s the anger? She answers the door, this guy somehow forces her back through the hallway, through the master bedroom, into the bathroom, and then carries thirty gallons of paint through after her, and he doesn\u0027t knock anything off those shelves.\"\n \"So?\"\n Reacher shrugged. \"Seems awful quiet to me. I couldn\u0027t wrestle somebody down that hallway without touching all that stuff. No way. Neither could you.\"\n Blake shook his head. \"He doesn\u0027t do any wrestling. Medical reports show the women probably aren\u0027t touched at all. It\u0027s a quiet scene, because there is no violence.\"\n \"You happy with that? Profile-wise? An angry soldier looking for retribution and punishment, but there\u0027s no uproar?\"\n \"He kills them, Reacher. The way I see it, that\u0027s retribution enough.\"\n There was silence. Reacher shrugged again. \"Whatever. \"\n Blake faced him down the length of the table. \"You\u0027d do it differently?\"\n \"Sure I would. Suppose you keep on pissing me off and I come after you. I don\u0027t see myself being especially gentle about it. I\u0027d probably smack you around a little. Maybe a lot. If I was mad with you, I\u0027d have to, right? That\u0027s what being mad is all about.\"\n \"So?\"\n \"And what about the paint? How does he bring it to the house? We should go to the store and check out what thirty gallons looks like. He must have a car parked outside for twenty, thirty minutes at least. How does nobody see it? A parked car, or a wagon, or a truck?\"\n \"Or a sport-utility, rather like yours.\"\n \"Maybe totally identical to mine. But how come nobody sees it?\"\n \"We don\u0027t know,\" Blake said.\n \"How does he kill them without leaving any marks?\"\n \"We don\u0027t know.\"\n \"That\u0027s a lot you don\u0027t know, right?\"\n Blake nodded. \"Yes, it is, smart guy. But we\u0027re working on it. We\u0027ve got eighteen days. And with a genius like you helping us, I\u0027m sure that\u0027s all we\u0027re going to need.\"\n \"You\u0027ve got eighteen days if he sticks to his interval, \" Reacher said. \"Suppose he doesn\u0027t?\"\n \"He will.\"\n \"You hope.\"\n Silence again. Blake looked at the table, and then at Lamarr. \"Julia?\"\n \"I stand by my profile,\" she said. \"Right now I\u0027m interested in Special Forces. They\u0027re stood down one week in three. I\u0027m sending Reacher to poke around.\"\n Blake nodded, reassured. \"OK, where?\"\n Lamarr glanced at Reacher, waiting. He looked at the three black flags on the map.\n \"Geography is all over the place,\" he said. \"This guy could be stationed anywhere in the United States.\"\n \"So?\"\n \"So Fort Dix would be the best place to start. There\u0027s a guy I know there.\"\n \"Who?\"\n \"A guy called John Trent,\" Reacher said. \"He\u0027s a colonel. If anybody\u0027s going to help me, he might.\"\n \" Fort Dix?\" Blake said. \"That\u0027s in New Jersey, right?\"\n \"It was last time I was there,\" Reacher said.\n \"OK, smart guy,\" Blake said. \"We\u0027ll call this Colonel Trent, get it set up.\"\n Reacher nodded. \"Make sure you mention my name loud and often. He won\u0027t be very interested unless you do.\"\n Blake nodded. \"That\u0027s exactly why we brought you on board. You\u0027ll leave with Harper, first thing in the morning.\"\n Reacher nodded, and looked straight at Lorraine Stanley\u0027s pretty face.\n YES, MAYBE IT\u0027S time to throw them a curve. Maybe tighten the interval, just a little bit. Maybe tighten it a lot. Maybe cancel it altogether. That would really unsettle them. That would show them how little they know. Keep everything else the same, but alter the interval. Make it all a little unpredictable. How about it? You need to think.\n Or maybe let a little of the anger show, too. Because anger is what this is about, right? Anger, and justice. Maybe it\u0027s time to make that a little clearer, a little more obvious. Maybe it\u0027s time to take the gloves off. A little violence never hurt anybody. And a little violence could make the next one a little more interesting. Maybe a lot more interesting. You need to think about that, too.\n So what\u0027s it to be? A shorter interval? Or more drama at the scene? Or both? How about both? Think, think, think.\n LISA HARPER TOOK Reacher up to ground level and outside into the chill air just after six in the evening. She led him down an immaculate concrete walkway toward the next building in line. There were knee-high lights set on both sides of the path, a yard apart, already turned on against the gloom of evening. Harper walked with an exaggerated long stride. Reacher wasn\u0027t sure if she was trying to match his, or if it was something she\u0027d learned in deportment class. Whatever, it made her look pretty good. He found himself wondering what she\u0027d look like if she was running. Or lying down, with nothing on.\n \"Cafeteria\u0027s in here,\" she said.\n She was ahead of him at another double set of glass doors. She pulled one open and waited until he went inside in front of her.\n \"To the left,\" she said.\n There was a long corridor with the clattering sound and the vegetable smell of a communal dining room at the end of it. He walked ahead of her. It was warm inside the building. He could sense her at his shoulder.\n \"OK, help yourself,\" she said. \"Bureau\u0027s paying.\"\n The cafeteria was a big double-height room, brightly lit, with molded-plywood chairs at plain tables. There was a service counter along one side. A line of personnel, waiting with trays in their hands. Big groups of trainees in dark blue sweats, separated by senior agents in suits standing in ones and twos. Reacher joined the end of the line, with Harper at his side.\n The line shuffled up and he was served a filet mignon the size of a paperback book by a cheerful Spanish guy with ID around his neck. He moved on and got vegetables and fries from the next server in line. He filled a cup with coffee from an urn. He took silverware and a napkin and looked around for a table.\n \"By the window,\" Harper said.\n She led him to a table for four, standing empty by the glass. The bright light in the room made it full dark outside. She put her tray on the table and took her jacket off. Draped it on the back of her chair. She wasn\u0027t thin, but her height made her very slender. Her shirt was fine cotton, and she wore nothing underneath it. That was pretty clear. She undid her cuffs and rolled her sleeves to the elbow, one by one. Her forearms were smooth and brown.\n \"Nice tan,\" Reacher said.\n She sighed.\n \"FAQs again?\" she said. \"Yes, it\u0027s all over, and no, I don\u0027t especially want to prove it.\"\n He smiled.\n \"Just making conversation,\" he said.\n She looked straight at him.\n \"I\u0027ll talk about the case,\" she said. \"If you want conversation. \"\n \"I don\u0027t know much about the case. Do you?\"\n She nodded. \"I know I want this guy caught. Those women were pretty brave, making a stand like that.\"\n \"Sounds like the voice of experience.\"\n He cut into his steak and tasted it. It was pretty good. He\u0027d paid forty bucks for worse in city restaurants.\n \"It\u0027s the voice of cowardice,\" she said. \"I haven\u0027t made a stand. Not yet anyway.\"\n \"You getting harassed?\"\n She smiled. \"Are you kidding?\" Then she blushed. \"I mean, can I say that without sounding big-headed or anything?\"\n He smiled back. \"Yes, in your case I think you can.\"\n \"It\u0027s nothing real serious,\" she said. \"Just talk, you know, just comments. Loaded questions, and innuendo. Nobody\u0027s said I should sleep with them to get promotion or anything. But it still gets to me. That\u0027s why I dress like this now. I\u0027m trying to make the point, you know, I\u0027m just the same as them, really.\"\n He smiled again. \"But it\u0027s gotten worse, right?\"\n She nodded, \"Right. Much worse.\"\n He made no reply.\n \"I don\u0027t know why,\" she said.\n He looked at her over the rim of his cup. Egyptian cotton button-down, pure white, maybe a thirteen-inch collar, a blue tie knotted neatly in place and rising gently over her small mobile breasts, men\u0027s trousers with big darts taken out of them to curve in around her tiny waist. Tanned face, white teeth, great cheekbones, blue eyes, the long blond hair.\n \"Is there a camera in my room?\" he asked.\n \"A what?\"\n \"A camera,\" he said again. \"You know, video surveillance. \"\n \"Why?\"\n \"I\u0027m just wondering if this is a backup plan. In case Petrosian doesn\u0027t pan out.\"\n \"What do you mean?\"\n \"Why isn\u0027t Poulton looking after me? He doesn\u0027t seem to have much else to do.\"\n \"I don\u0027t follow.\"\n \"Yes you do. That\u0027s why Blake assigned you, right? So you could get real close to me? All this vulnerable little-girl-lost stuff? I don\u0027t know why? So maybe if Blake wants to stop banging on about Petrosian, he\u0027s got something else to twist my arm with, like a nice intimate little scene, you and me in my room, on a nice little videocassette he can say he\u0027ll send to Jodie.\"\n She blushed. \"I wouldn\u0027t do a thing like that.\"\n \"But he asked you to, right?\"\n She was quiet for a long time. Reacher looked away and drained his coffee, staring at his own reflection in the glass.\n \"He practically challenged me to try,\" he said. \"Told me you\u0027re the bitch from hell, if anybody puts the moves on.\"\n She was still silent.\n \"But I wouldn\u0027t fall for it, anyway,\" he said. \"Because I\u0027m not stupid. I\u0027m not about to give them any more ammunition.\"\n She was quiet another minute. Then she looked at him and smiled.\n \"So can we relax?\" she said. \"Get past it?\"\n He nodded. \"Sure, let\u0027s relax. Let\u0027s get past it. You can put your jacket back on now. You can stop showing me your breasts.\"\n She blushed again. \"I took it off because I was warm. No other reason.\"\n \"OK, I\u0027m not complaining.\"\n He turned away again and watched the dark through the window.\n \"You want dessert?\" she asked.\n He turned back and nodded. \"And more coffee.\"\n \"You stay here. I\u0027ll get it.\"\n She walked back to the serving counter. The room seemed to fall silent. Every eye was on her. She came back with a tray bearing two ice cream sundaes and two cups of coffee. A hundred people watched her all the way.\n \"I apologize,\" Reacher said.\n She bent and slid the tray onto the table. \"For what?\"\n He shrugged. \"For looking at you the way I\u0027ve been looking at you, I guess. You must be sick of it. Everybody looking at you all the time.\"\n She smiled. \"Look at me as much as you like, and I\u0027ll look at you right back, because you aren\u0027t the ugliest thing I ever saw either. But that\u0027s as far as it\u0027s going to go, OK?\"\n He smiled back. \"Deal.\"\n The ice cream was excellent. It had hot fudge sauce all over it. The coffee was strong. If he narrowed his eyes and cut out the rest of the room, he could rate this place about as highly as he had rated Mostro\u0027s.\n \"What do people do here in the evenings?\" he asked.\n \"Mostly they go home,\" Harper said. \"But not you. You go back to your room. Blake\u0027s orders.\"\n \"We\u0027re following Blake\u0027s orders now?\"\n She smiled. \"Some of them.\"\n He nodded. \"OK, so let\u0027s go.\"\n SHE LEFT HIM on the side of the door without the handle. He stood there and heard her footsteps recede across the carpet outside. Then the thump of the elevator door. Then the whine of the car going down. Then the floor fell silent. He walked to the nightstand and dialed Jodie\u0027s apartment. The machine cut in. He dialed her office. No answer. He tried her mobile. It was not in service.\n He walked to the bathroom. Somebody had supplemented his toothbrush with a tube of toothpaste and a disposable razor and a can of shaving cream. There was a bottle of shampoo on the rim of the tub. There was soap in the dish. Fluffy white towels on the rack. He stripped and hung his clothes on the back of the door. Set the shower to hot and stepped under the water.\n He stood there for ten minutes and then shut it off. Toweled himself dry. Walked naked to the window and pulled the drapes. Lay down on the bed and scanned the ceiling. He found the camera. The lens was a black tube the diameter of a nickel, wedged deep in a crack in the molding where the wall met the ceiling. He turned back to the phone. Dialed all the same numbers again. Her apartment. He got the machine. Her office. No reply. Her mobile. Switched off. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/running-blind-jack-reacher-4/page-9.html","bookId":2342,"book":{"id":2342,"title":"Running Blind (Jack Reacher #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Running Blind (Jack Reacher #4) \n Women are being murdered nationwide by a killer who leaves no trace of evidence, no fatal wounds, no signs of struggle, and no clues to an apparent motive.
