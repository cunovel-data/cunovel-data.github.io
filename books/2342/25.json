{"id":65921,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"STEALING THE PHONE was candy from a baby, but the reconnaissance is a bitch. Timing it right was the first priority. You needed to wait for complete darkness, and you wanted to wait for the daytime cop\u0027s final hour. Because the cop is dumber than the Bureau guy, and because somebody\u0027s last hour is always better than somebody else\u0027s first hour. Attention will have waned. Boredom will have set in. His eyes will have glazed and he\u0027ll be thinking ahead to a beer with his buddies or a night in front of the television with his wife. Or however the hell he spends his downtime.\\n\\n So your window extends to about forty minutes, say seven to seven-forty. You plan it in two halves. First the house, then the surrounding area. You drive back from the airport and you approach on the through road. You drive straight through the junction three streets from her house. You stop at a hikers\u0027 parking area two hundred yards farther north. There\u0027s a wide gravel trail leading east up the slope of Mount Hood. You get out of your car and you turn your back on the trail and you work your way west and north through lightly wooded terrain. You\u0027re about level with your first position, but on the other side of her house, behind it, not in front of it.\\n\\n The terrain means the houses don\u0027t have big yards. There are slim cultivated strips behind the buildings, then fences, then steep hillside covered in wild brush. You ease through the brush and come out at her fence. Stand motionless in the dark and observe. Drapes are drawn. It\u0027s quiet. You can hear a piano playing, very faintly. The house is built into the hillside, and it\u0027s at right angles to the street. The side is really the front. The porch runs all the way along it. Facing you is a wall dotted with windows. No doors. You ease along the fence and check the other side, which is really the back of the house. No doors there either. So the only ways in are the front door on the porch, and the garage door facing the street. Not ideal, but it\u0027s what you expected. You\u0027ve planned for it. You\u0027ve planned for every contingency.\\n\\n \"OK, COLONEL KRUGER,\" Leighton said. \"We\u0027re on your ass now.\"\\n\\n They were back in the duty office, damp from the jog through the nighttime rain, high with elation, flushed with cold air and success. Handshakes had been exchanged, high fives had been smacked, Harper had laughed and hugged Reacher. Now Leighton was scrolling through a menu on his computer screen, and Reacher and Harper were sitting side by side in front of his desk on the old upright chairs, breathing hard. Harper was still smiling, basking in relief and triumph.\\n\\n \"Loved that business with the stool,\" she said. \"We watched the whole thing on the video screen.\"\\n\\n Reacher shrugged.\\n\\n \"I cheated,\" he said. \"I chose the right stool, is all. I figured visiting time, that sergeant sits on the one by the door, wriggles around a little because he\u0027s bored. Guy that size, the joints were sure to be cracked. The thing practically fell apart.\"\\n\\n \"But it looked real good.\"\\n\\n \"That was the plan. First rule is to look real good.\"\\n\\n \"OK, he\u0027s in the personnel listings,\" Leighton said. \"LaSalle Kruger, bird colonel, right there.\"\\n\\n He tapped the screen with his nail. It made the same glassy thunk they\u0027d heard before. Like a bottle.\\n\\n \"Has he been in trouble?\" Reacher asked.\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t tell, yet,\" Leighton said. \"You think he\u0027ll have an MP record?\"\\n\\n \"Something happened,\" Reacher said. \"Special Forces in Desert Storm, and now he\u0027s working supply? What\u0027s that about?\"\\n\\n Leighton nodded. \"It needs explaining. Could be disciplinary, I guess.\"\\n\\n He exited the personnel listings and clicked on another menu. Then he paused.\\n\\n \"This will take all night,\" he said.\\n\\n Reacher smiled. \"You mean you don\u0027t want us to see anything.\"\\n\\n Leighton smiled back. \"Right first time, pal. You can smack the prisoners around as much as you want, but you can\u0027t look at the computer stuff. You know how it is.\"\\n\\n \"I sure do,\" Reacher said.\\n\\n Leighton waited.\\n\\n \"That inventory thing about the jeep tires?\" Harper said suddenly. \"Could you trace some missing camouflage paint in there?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe,\" Leighton said. \"Theoretically, I guess.\"\\n\\n \"Eleven women on his list, look for about three hundred gallons,\" she said. \"If you could put Kruger together with the paint, that would do it for me.\"\\n\\n Leighton nodded.\\n\\n \"And dates,\" she said. \"Find out if he was off duty when the women were killed. And match the locations, I guess. Confirm there were thefts where the women served. Prove they saw something.\"\\n\\n Leighton looked across at her. \"The Army is going to just love me, right? Kruger\u0027s our guy, and I\u0027m busting my ass all night so we can give him away to the Bureau.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said. \"But the jurisdiction issue is clear, isn\u0027t it? Homicide beats theft.\"\\n\\n Leighton nodded, suddenly somber.\\n\\n \"Like scissors beats paper,\" he said.\\n\\n YOU\u0027VE SEEN ENOUGH of the house. Standing there in the dark staring at it and listening to her play the damn piano isn\u0027t going to change anything. So you step away from the fence and duck into the brush and work your way east and south, back toward the car. You get there and dust yourself off and slide in and start it up and head back down through the crossroads. Part two of your task ahead, and you\u0027ve got about twenty minutes to complete it in. You drive on. There\u0027s a small shopping center two miles west of the junction, left-hand side of the road. An old-fashioned one-story mall, shaped like a squared-off letter C. A supermarket in the middle like a keystone, small single-unit stores spreading either side of it. Some of them are boarded up and empty. You pull into the parking lot at the far end and you nose along the fire lane, looking. You find exactly what you want, three stores past the supermarket. It\u0027s nothing you didn\u0027t expect to find, but still you clench your fist and bang it on the rim of the steering wheel. You smile to yourself.\\n\\n Then you turn the car around and idle back through the lot, checking it out, and your smile dies. You don\u0027t like it. You don\u0027t like it at all. It\u0027s completely overlooked. Every storefront has a direct view. It\u0027s badly lit now, but you\u0027re thinking about daylight. So you drive around behind the arm of the C, and your smile comes back again. There\u0027s a single row of overspill parking back there, facing plain painted delivery doors in the back walls of the stores. No windows. You stop the car and look around. A complete circle. This is your place. No doubt about it. It\u0027s perfect.\\n\\n Then you drive back into the main lot and you park up alongside a small group of other vehicles. You kill the motor and wait. You watch the through road. You wait and watch ten minutes, and then you see the Bureau Buick heading by, not fast, not slow, reporting for duty.\\n\\n \"Have a nice night,\" you whisper.\\n\\n Then you start your car again and wind around the parking lot and drive off in the opposite direction.\\n\\n LEIGHTON RECOMMENDED A motel a mile down Route 1 toward Trenton. He said it was where the prisoners\u0027 visitors stayed, it was cheap, it was clean, it was the only place for miles around and he knew the phone number. Harper drove, and they found it easily enough. It looked fine from the outside, and it had plenty of vacancies.\\n\\n \"Number twelve is a nice double,\" the desk clerk said.\\n\\n Harper nodded.\\n\\n \"OK, we\u0027ll take it,\" she said.\\n\\n \"We will?\" Reacher said. \"A double?\"\\n\\n \"Talk about it later,\" she said.\\n\\n She paid cash and the desk guy handed over a key.\\n\\n \"Number twelve,\" he said again. \"Down the row a piece.\"\\n\\n Reacher walked through the rain, and Harper brought the car. She parked it in front of the cabin and found Reacher waiting at the door.\\n\\n \"What?\" she said. \"It\u0027s not like we\u0027re going to sleep, is it? We\u0027re just waiting for Leighton to call. May as well do that in here as in the car.\"\\n\\n He just shrugged and waited for her to unlock the door. She opened up and went inside. He followed.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m too excited to sleep, anyway,\" she said.\\n\\n It was a standard motel room, familiar and comforting. It was overheated and the rain was loud on the roof. There were two chairs and a table at the far end of the room by a window. Reacher walked through and sat in the right-hand chair. Put his elbows on the table and his head in his hands. Kept very still. Harper moved around, restlessly.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve got him, you know that?\" she said.\\n\\n Reacher said nothing.\\n\\n \"I should call Blake, give him the good news,\" Harper said.\\n\\n Reacher shook his head. \"Not yet.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\"\\n\\n \"Let Leighton finish up. Quantico gets involved at this point, they\u0027ll pull him off. He\u0027s only a captain. They\u0027ll haul in some two-star asshole, and he\u0027ll never get near the facts for the bullshit. Leave it with Leighton, let him get the glory.\"\\n\\n She was in the bathroom, looking at the rack of towels and the bottles of shampoo and the packets of soap. She came out and took her jacket off. Reacher looked away.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s perfectly safe,\" she said. \"I\u0027m wearing a bra.\"\\n\\n Reacher said nothing.\\n\\n \"What?\" she asked. \"Something\u0027s on your mind.\"\\n\\n \"It is?\"\\n\\n She nodded. \"Sure it is. I can tell. I\u0027m a woman. I\u0027m intuitive.\"\\n\\n He looked straight at her. \"Truth is I don\u0027t especially want to be alone in a room with you and a bed.\"\\n\\n She smiled, happily, mischievously. \"Tempted?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m only human.\"\\n\\n \"So am I,\" she said. \"If I can control myself, I\u0027m sure you can.\"\\n\\n He said nothing.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to take a shower,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Christ,\" he muttered.\\n\\n IT\u0027S A STANDARD motel room, like a thousand you\u0027ve seen coast to coast. Doorway, bathroom on the right, closet on the left, queen bed, dresser, table and two chairs. Old television, ice bucket, awful pictures on the wall. You hang your coat in the closet, but you keep your gloves on. No need to leave fingerprints all over the place. No real possibility of them ever finding the room, but you\u0027ve built your whole life on being careful. The only time you take your gloves off is when you\u0027re washing, and motel bathrooms are safe enough. You check out at eleven, and by twelve a maid is spraying cleaner all over every surface and wiping everything with a wet cloth. Nobody ever found a meaningful fingerprint in a motel bathroom.\\n\\n You walk through the room and you sit in the left-hand chair. You lean back, you close your eyes, and you start to think. Tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow. You plan the timing by working backward. You need dark before you can get out. That\u0027s the fundamental consideration. That drives everything else. But you want the daytime cop to find her. You accept that\u0027s just a whim on your part, but hey, if you can\u0027t brighten things up with a little whimsy, what kind of life is that? So you need to be out after dark, but before the cop\u0027s last bathroom break. That specifies a pretty exact time, somewhere between six and six-thirty. Call it five-forty, for a margin. No, call it five-thirty, because you really need to be back in position to see the cop\u0027s face.\\n\\n OK, five-thirty. Twilight, not really dark, but it\u0027s acceptable. The longest time you spent in any of the previous places was twenty-two minutes. In principle this one won\u0027t be any longer, but you\u0027re going to allow a full half hour. So you need to be inside and started by five. Then you think it through from her point of view, and it\u0027s pretty clear you need to be making the phone call at about two o\u0027clock.\\n\\n So, check out of this dump before eleven, you\u0027re over there before twelve, you wait and watch, you make the call at two. It\u0027s decided. You open your eyes and stand up. Undress and use the bathroom. Pull back the covers and slide into bed, wearing nothing but your gloves.\\n\\n HARPER CAME OUT of the bathroom wearing nothing but a towel. Her face was scrubbed and her hair was wet. Under the weight of the water, it hung down past her waist. Without makeup, her face looked vulnerable. Cornflower-blue eyes, white teeth, cheekbones, skin. She looked about fourteen, except she was more than six feet tall. And that kind of height made a standard-issue motel towel seriously deficient in terms of length.\\n\\n \"I think I better call Blake,\" she said. \"I should really check in.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t tell him anything,\" Reacher said. \"I mean it, things will spin out of control.\"\\n\\n She nodded. \"I\u0027ll just tell him we\u0027re close.\"\\n\\n He shook his head. \"Vaguer than that, OK? Just say we\u0027re seeing some guy tomorrow who might have something connected.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be careful,\" she said. She sat down at the mirror. The towel rode up. She started looking at her hair.\\n\\n \"Can you get my phone out of my pocketbook for me?\" she called.\\n\\n He walked to the bed and slipped his hand into her bag. Things in there released faint fragrance as they moved. He found the phone and slipped it out and carried it over to her.\\n\\n \"Be real vague, OK?\" he said again.\\n\\n She nodded and opened the phone.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry,\" she said.\\n\\n \"I guess I\u0027ll shower too.\"\\n\\n She smiled. \"Enjoy. I won\u0027t come in, I promise.\"\\n\\n He went into the bathroom and closed the door. Harper\u0027s clothes were hanging from the hook on the back. All of them. The underwear was white and lacy. He thought about setting the shower icy cold, but decided to rely on willpower alone. So he set it hot and stripped off his clothes. Dumped them in a pile on the floor. Took the folding toothbrush from his jacket pocket and cleaned his teeth with plain water. Then he stood under the shower and washed with the same soap and shampoo Harper had used. He stood for a long time, trying to relax. Then he gave it up and turned the handle to cold. He held it there, gasping. One minute. Two. Then he shut it off and groped for a towel.\\n\\n She knocked on the door.\\n\\n \"Are you done?\" she called. \"I need my clothes.\"\\n\\n He unfolded the towel and wrapped it around his waist.\\n\\n \"OK, come in,\" he called.\\n\\n \"Just pass them out,\" she called back.\\n\\n He bunched them into his hand and lifted them off the hook. Cracked the door and passed them through. She took them and walked away. He toweled himself almost dry and dressed, awkward in the narrow space. Combed his hair with his fingers. He stood still for a minute. Then he rattled the door handle and came out. She was standing by the bed, wearing some of her clothes. The rest of them were folded over the back of the dresser chair. Her hair was combed back. Her phone was closed, lying next to the ice bucket.\\n\\n \"What did you tell him?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Just what you said. We\u0027re meeting some guy in the morning, noting specific.\"\\n\\n She was wearing the shirt, but the tie was draped over the chair. So was the bra. And the suit trousers.\\n\\n \"He have anything to say?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Poulton\u0027s in Spokane,\" she said. \"The Hertz thing came to nothing, just some woman on business. But the UPS guy is coming through with stuff. They\u0027re talking tonight, but they\u0027re three hours behind, so we won\u0027t hear anything until morning, probably. But they identified the date from the baseball thing and UPS is pulling the records.\"\\n\\n \"Won\u0027t say LaSalle Kruger on the paperwork, that\u0027s for sure.\"\\n\\n \"Probably not, but that doesn\u0027t matter anymore, does it? We found him.\"\\n\\n She sat down on the edge of the bed, her back to him.\\n\\n \"Thanks to you,\" she said. \"You were absolutely right, a smart guy with a good solid plain-vanilla motive. \"\\n\\n She stood up again, restless. Paced the small area between the bed and the table. She was wearing the underpants. He could see that, through the shirttails. Her ass was wonderful. Her legs were lean. And long. Her feet were small and delicate, for her height.\\n\\n \"We should celebrate,\" she said.\\n\\n Reacher propped the pillows on the far side of the bed and leaned back against them. Looked up at the ceiling and concentrated on the sound of the rain battering on the roof.\\n\\n \"No room service in a place like this,\" he said.\\n\\n She turned to face him. The first two buttons on her shirt were undone. Thing like that, the effect depends on how far apart the buttons are. If they\u0027re close together, it doesn\u0027t mean much. But these were well spaced out, maybe three or four inches between each of them.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Jodie, isn\u0027t it?\" she said.\\n\\n He nodded. \"Of course it is.\"\\n\\n \"Wasn\u0027t for her, you\u0027d want to, right?\"\\n\\n \"I do want to,\" he said.\\n\\n Then he paused.\\n\\n \"But I won\u0027t,\" he said. \"Because of her.\"\\n\\n She looked at him, and then she smiled.\\n\\n \"I like that in a guy, I guess,\" she said.\\n\\n He said nothing.\\n\\n \"Steadfastness,\" she said.\\n\\n He said nothing. There was silence. Just the sound of the rain on the roof, relentless and insistent.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s an attractive characteristic,\" she said.\\n\\n He looked at the ceiling.\\n\\n \"Not that you\u0027re short of attractive characteristics,\" she said.\\n\\n He listened to the rain. She sighed, just a tiny sound. She moved away, just an inch. But enough to ease the crisis.\\n\\n \"So you\u0027re going to stick around New York,\" she said.\\n\\n He nodded again. \"That\u0027s the plan.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027ll be pissed about the house. Her father willed it to you.\"\\n\\n \"She might be,\" he said. \"But she\u0027ll have to deal with it. The way I see it, he left me a choice, more than anything. The house, or the money I\u0027d get for it. My choice. He knew what I was like. He wouldn\u0027t be surprised. Or upset either.\"\\n\\n \"But it\u0027s an emotional issue.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t see why,\" he said. \"It wasn\u0027t her childhood home or anything. They never really lived there. She didn\u0027t grow up there. It\u0027s just a wooden building.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s an anchor. That\u0027s how she sees it.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s why I\u0027m selling it.\"\\n\\n \"Therefore naturally she\u0027ll worry.\"\\n\\n He shrugged. \"She\u0027ll learn. I\u0027ll stick around, house or no house.\"\\n\\n The room went quiet again. The rain was easing. She sat down on the bed, opposite him. Tucked her bare knees up under her.\\n\\n \"I still feel like celebrating,\" she said.\\n\\n She put her hand palm down in the space between them and leaned over.\\n\\n \"Celebration kiss,\" she whispered. \"Nothing more, I promise.\"\\n\\n He looked at her and reached around with his left arm and pulled her close. Kissed her on the lips. She put her hand behind his head and pushed her fingers into his hair. Tilted her head and opened her mouth. He felt her tongue on his teeth. In his mouth. He closed his eyes. Her tongue was urgent. Deep in his mouth. It felt good. He opened his eyes and saw hers, too close to focus on. They were shut tight. He let her go and pulled away, full of guilt.\\n\\n \"Something I need to tell you,\" he said.\\n\\n She was breathless, and her hair was a mess.\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not being straight with you,\" he said.\\n\\n \"How not?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think Kruger\u0027s our guy.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n There was silence. They were inches apart, on the bed. Her hand was still laced behind his head, in his hair.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s Leighton\u0027s guy,\" Reacher said. \"I don\u0027t think he\u0027s ours. I never really did.\"\\n\\n \"What? You always did. This was your theory, Reacher. Why back away from it now?\"\\n\\n \"Because I didn\u0027t really mean it, Harper. I was just thinking aloud. Bullshitting, basically. I\u0027m very surprised there even is such a guy.\"\\n\\n She pulled her hand away, astonished.\\n\\n \"But this was your theory,\" she said again.\\n\\n He shrugged. \"I just made it up. I didn\u0027t mean any of it. I just wanted some kind of a plausible excuse to get me out of Quantico for a spell.\"\\n\\n She stared at him. \"You made it up? You didn\u0027t mean it?\"\\n\\n He shrugged. \"It was halfway convincing, I guess. But I didn\u0027t believe in it.\"\\n\\n \"So why the hell say it?\"\\n\\n \"I told you. I just wanted to get out of there. To give myself time to think. And it was an experiment. I wanted to see who would support it and who would oppose it. I wanted to see who really wants this thing solved.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t believe this,\" she said. \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\"\\n\\n \"We all want it solved,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Poulton opposed it,\" Reacher said.\\n\\n She stared at him, from a foot away.\\n\\n \"What is this to you? A game?\" she said.\\n\\n He said nothing. She was silent, a minute, two, three.\\n\\n \"What the hell are you doing?\" she said. \"There are lives at stake here.\"\\n\\n Then there was pounding at the door. Loud, insistent knocking. She pulled away from him. He let her go and put his feet on the floor and stood up. Ran his hand through his hair and walked toward the door. A new barrage started up. A heavy hand, knocking hard.\\n\\n \"OK,\" he called. \"I\u0027m coming.\"\\n\\n The pounding stopped. He opened the door. There was an Army Chevrolet parked at an angle outside the room. Leighton was standing on the stoop, his hand raised, his jacket open, raindrops on the shoulders.\\n\\n \"Kruger\u0027s our guy,\" he said.\\n\\n He pushed past, inside the room. Saw Harper buttoning her shirt.\\n\\n \"Excuse me,\" he said.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s hot in here,\" she said, looking away.\\n\\n Leighton looked down at the bed, like he was surprised.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s our guy, for sure,\" he said. \"Everything fits like a glove.\"\\n\\n Harper\u0027s mobile started ringing. It was over by the ice bucket, on the dresser, squawking like an alarm clock. Leighton paused. Gestured I can wait. Harper scrambled over the bed and flipped the phone open. Reacher heard a voice, feathery and distorted and faraway. Harper listened to it and Reacher watched the color drain out of her face. Watched her close the phone and put it down like it was fragile as crystal.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re recalled to Quantico,\" she said. \"Effective immediately. Because they got Caroline Cooke\u0027s full record. You were right, she was all over the place. But she was never anywhere near weapons. Not ever. Not within a million miles, not for a minute.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m here to tell you,\" Leighton said. \"Kruger\u0027s our guy, but he isn\u0027t yours.\"\\n\\n Reacher just nodded. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/running-blind-jack-reacher-4/page-25.html","bookId":2342,"book":{"id":2342,"title":"Running Blind (Jack Reacher #4)","description":"Storyline: Running Blind (Jack Reacher #4) \\n Women are being murdered nationwide by a killer who leaves no trace of evidence, no fatal wounds, no signs of struggle, and no clues to an apparent motive.
