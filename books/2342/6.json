Blake and Lamarr had left him in Garrison and twenty restless minutes later he had driven south to the city. Jodie came home at six in the morning looking for breakfast and a shower and found him waiting in her living room. \"Are they serious?\" \"I don\u0027t know. Probably.\" \"Shit, I can\u0027t believe it.\" \"They\u0027re desperate,\" he said. \"And they\u0027re arrogant. And they like to win. And they\u0027re an elite group. Put it all together, this is how they behave. I\u0027ve seen it before. Some of our guys were exactly the same. They did what it takes.\" \"How long have you got?\" \"I have to call them by eight. With a decision.\" \"So what are you going to do?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said again. Her coat was over the back of a kitchen chair. She was pacing nervously, back and forth in her peach dress. She had been awake and alert for twenty-three straight hours, but there was nothing to prove it except a faint blue tinge at the inside corners of her eyes. \"They can\u0027t get away with this, can they?\" she said. \"Maybe they\u0027re not serious.\" \"Maybe they\u0027re not,\" he said. \"But it\u0027s a game, right? A gamble? One way or the other, we\u0027re going to worry about it. Forever.\" She dropped into a chair and crossed her legs. Put her head back and shook her hair until it fell behind her shoulders. She was everything Julia Lamarr was not. A visitor from outer space would categorize them both as women, with the same parts in the same quantities, hair and eyes and mouths and arms and legs, but one was a dream and the other was a nightmare. \"It just went too far,\" he said. \"My fault, absolutely. I was jerking them around, because I just didn\u0027t like her at all, from the start. So I figured I\u0027d tease them a little, keep it going, and then eventually say yes. But they dropped this on me, before I could get around to it.\" \"So get them to take it back. Start over. Cooperate.\" He shook his head. \"No, threatening me is one thing. You, that\u0027s way over the line. They\u0027re prepared to even think a thing like that, then to hell with them.\" \"But were they really serious?\" she said again. \"Safest strategy is assume they might be.\" She nodded. \"So I\u0027m scared. And I guess I\u0027d still be a little scared, even if they took it back.\" \"Exactly,\" he said. \"What\u0027s done is done.\" \"But why? Why are they so desperate? Why the threats?\" \"History,\" he said. \"You know what it\u0027s like. Everybody hates everybody else. Blake said that to me. And it\u0027s true. MPs wouldn\u0027t piss on Quantico if it was on fire. Because of Vietnam. Your dad could have told you all about it. He\u0027s an example.\" \"What happened about Vietnam?\" \"There was a rule of thumb, draft dodgers were the Bureau\u0027s business, and deserters were ours. Different categories, right? And we knew how to handle deserters. Some of them went to the slammer, but some of them got a little TLC. The jungle wasn\u0027t a lot of fun for the grunts, and the recruiting depots weren\u0027t exactly bulging at the seams, remember? So the MPs would calm the good ones down and send them back, but nine times out of ten the Bureau would arrest them again anyway, on the way to the airport. Drove the MPs crazy. Hoover was unbearable. It was a turf war like you never saw. Result was a perfectly reasonable guy like Leon would hardly even speak to the FBI ever again. Wouldn\u0027t take calls, didn\u0027t bust a gut answering the mail.\" \"And it\u0027s still the same?\" He nodded. \"Institutions have long memories. That stuff is like yesterday. Never forgive, never forget.\" \"Even though women are in danger?\" He shrugged. \"Nobody ever said institutional thinking is rational.\" \"So they really need somebody?\" \"If they want to get anywhere.\" \"But why you?\" \"Lots of reasons. I was involved with a couple of the cases, they could find me, I was senior enough to know where to look for things, senior enough that the current generation probably still owes me a few favors. \" She nodded. \"So put it all together, they probably are serious.\" He said nothing. \"So what are we going to do?\" He paused. \"We could think laterally,\" he said into the silence. \"How?\" \"You could come with me.\" She shook her head. \"They wouldn\u0027t let me come with you. And I can\u0027t, anyway. Could be weeks, right? I have to work. The partnership decision is coming up.\" He nodded. \"We could do it another way.\" \"OK, how?\" \"I could go take Petrosian out.\" She stared at him. Said nothing. \"No more threat,\" he said. \"Like trumping their ace.\" She turned her stare to the ceiling, and then she shook her head again, slowly. \"We have a thing at the firm,\" she said. \"We call it the so what else rule. Suppose we\u0027ve got some bankrupt guy we\u0027re looking after. Sometimes we dig around and find he\u0027s got some funds stashed away that he\u0027s not telling us about. He\u0027s hiding them from us. He\u0027s cheating. First thing we do, we say so what else? What else is he doing? What else has he got?\" \"So?\" \"So what are they really doing here? Maybe this is not about the women at all. Maybe this is about Petrosian. He\u0027s presumably a smart, slippery guy. Maybe there\u0027s nothing to pin on him. No evidence, no witnesses. So maybe Cozo is using Blake and Lamarr to get you to get Petrosian. They profiled you, right? Psychologically? They know how you think. They know how you\u0027ll react. They know if they use Petrosian to threaten me, your very first thought will be to go get Petrosian. Then he\u0027s off the street without a trial, which they probably couldn\u0027t win anyway. And nothing is traceable back to the Bureau. Maybe they\u0027re using you as an assassin. Like a guided missile or something. They wind you up, and off you go.\" He said nothing. \"Or maybe it\u0027s something else,\" she said. \"This guy killing these women sounds pretty smart too, right? No evidence anywhere? Sounds like it\u0027s going to be a difficult case to prove. So maybe the idea is you eliminate him. There might not be enough proof to satisfy the courts, but there might be enough to satisfy you. In which case you fix him, on behalf of the women you knew. Job done, cheap and quick, nothing traceable back. They\u0027re using you like a magic bullet. They fire it here in New York, and it hits home wherever and whenever.\" Reacher was silent. \"Maybe you were never a suspect at all,\" she said. \"Maybe they weren\u0027t looking for a killer. Maybe they were looking for somebody who would kill a killer.\" There was silence in the room. Outside, the street sounds of early morning were starting up. It was dark gray dawn, and traffic was building. \"Could be both things,\" Reacher said. \"Petrosian and this other guy.\" \"They\u0027re smart people,\" Jodie said. He nodded. \"They sure as hell are.\" \"So what are you going to do?\" \"I don\u0027t know. All I know is I can\u0027t go to Quantico and leave you here alone in the same city as Petrosian. I just can\u0027t do that.\" \"But maybe they\u0027re not serious. Would the FBI really do something like that?\" \"You\u0027re going around in a circle. The answer is, we just don\u0027t know. And that\u0027s the whole point. That\u0027s the effect they wanted. Just not knowing is enough, isn\u0027t it?\" \"And if you don\u0027t go?\" \"Then I stay here and guard you every minute of every day until we get fed up with it to the point where I go after Petrosian anyway, irrespective of whether they were kidding in the first place or not.\" \"And if you do go?\" \"Then they keep me on the ball with the threat against you. And in their opinion on the ball means what? Can I stop after I find the guy? Or do they make me go all the way and rub him out?\" \"Smart people,\" she said again. \"Why didn\u0027t they just ask me straight?\" \"They can\u0027t just ask you. It would be a hundred percent illegal. And you mustn\u0027t do it, anyway.\" \"I can\u0027t?\" \"No, not Petrosian or the killer. You mustn\u0027t do either thing they want.\" \"Why not?\" \"Because then they own you, Reacher. Two vigilante homicides, with their knowledge? Right under their noses? The Bureau would own you, the whole rest of your life.\" He leaned his hands on the window frame and stared at the street below. \"You\u0027re in a hell of a spot,\" she said. \"We both are.\" He said nothing. \"So what are you going to do?\" she asked again. \"I\u0027m going to think,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve got until eight o\u0027clock.\" She nodded. \"Think carefully.\" JODIE WENT BACK to work. The partnership track beckoned. Reacher sat alone in her apartment and thought hard for thirty minutes, and then he was on the phone for twenty. Blake had said maybe there are people who still owe you favors. Then at five minutes to eight he called the number Lamarr had given him. She answered, first ring. \"I\u0027m in,\" he said. \"I\u0027m not happy about it, but I\u0027ll do it.\" There was a brief pause. He imagined the crooked teeth, revealed in a smile. \"Go home and pack a bag,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll pick you up in two hours exactly.\" \"No, I\u0027m going to see Jodie. I\u0027ll meet you at the airport.\" \"We\u0027re not going by plane.\" \"We\u0027re not?\" \"No, I never fly. We\u0027re driving.\" \"To Virginia? How long will that take?\" \"Five, six hours.\" \"Six hours? In a car with you? Shit, I\u0027m not doing that.\" \"You\u0027re doing what you\u0027re told, Reacher. Garrison, in two hours.\" JODIE\u0027S OFFICE WAS on the fortieth floor of a sixty-floor tower on Wall Street. The lobby had twenty-four-hour security and Reacher had a pass from Jodie\u0027s firm that let him through, day or night. She was alone at her desk, reviewing morning information from the markets in London. \"You OK?\" he asked her. \"Tired,\" she said. \"You should go back home.\" \"Right, like I\u0027m really going to sleep.\" He moved to the window and looked out at a sliver of lightening sky. \"Relax,\" he said. \"There\u0027s nothing to worry about.\" She made no reply. \"I decided what to do,\" he said. She shook her head. \"Well, don\u0027t tell me about it. I don\u0027t need to know.\" \"It\u0027ll work out. I promise.\" She sat still for a second, and then she joined him at the window. Nuzzled into his chest and held him tight, her cheek against his shirt. \"Take care,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll take care,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t worry about it.\" \"Don\u0027t do anything stupid.\" \"Don\u0027t worry about it,\" he said again. She turned her face up and they kissed. He kept it going, long and hard, figuring the feeling was going to have to last him into the foreseeable future. HE DROVE FASTER than usual and was back at his house ten minutes before Lamarr\u0027s two hours were up. He took his folding toothbrush from the bathroom and clipped it into his inside pocket. He bolted the basement door and turned the thermostat down. Turned all the faucets off hard and locked the front door. Unplugged the phone in the den and went outside through the kitchen. He walked to the end of the yard through the trees and looked down at the river. It was gray and sluggish, lined with morning mist like a quilt. On the opposite bank, the leaves were starting to turn, shading from tired green to brown and pale orange. The buildings of West Point were barely visible. The sun was coming over the ridge of his roof, but it was watery, with no warmth in it. He walked back to the house and skirted the garage and came out on his driveway. Hunched into his coat and walked out to the street. He didn\u0027t look back at the house. Out of sight, out of mind. That was the way he wanted it. He crossed the shoulder and leaned on his mailbox, watching the road, waiting.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/running-blind-jack-reacher-4/page-6.html","bookId":2342,"book":{"id":2342,"title":"Running Blind (Jack Reacher #4)","description":"Storyline: Running Blind (Jack Reacher #4) Women are being murdered nationwide by a killer who leaves no trace of evidence, no fatal wounds, no signs of struggle, and no clues to an apparent motive.
