{"id":65919,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"THE LAW PROVIDES that a narcotics conviction can be accompanied by confiscation of assets, which means that the DEA in New York City ends up with more automobiles than it can possibly ever need, so it loans out the surplus to other law enforcement agencies, including the FBI. The FBI uses those vehicles when it needs some anonymous transport that doesn\u0027t look like government-issue. Or when it needs to preserve some respectable distance between itself and some unspecified activity taking place. Therefore James Cozo withdrew the Bureau\u0027s sedan and the services of its driver and tossed Harper the keys to a black one-year-old Nissan Maxima currently parked in the back row of the underground lot.\n \"Have fun,\" he said again.\n Harper drove. It was the first time she had driven in New York City, and she was nervous about it. She threaded around a couple of blocks and headed south on Fifth and motored slowly, with the taxis plunging and darting and honking around her.\n \"OK, what now?\" she said.\n Now we waste some time, Reacher thought.\n \"Bob\u0027s not around until eight,\" he said. \"We\u0027ve got the whole afternoon to kill.\"\n \"I feel like we should be doing something.\"\n \"No rush,\" Reacher said. \"We\u0027ve got three weeks.\"\n \"So what do we do?\"\n \"First we eat,\" Reacher said. \"I missed breakfast.\"\n YOU\u0027RE HAPPY TO miss breakfast because you need to be sure. The way you predict it, it\u0027s going to be a straight twelve-hour/twelve-hour split between the local police department and the Bureau, with changeovers at eight in the evening and eight in the morning. You saw it happen at eight in the evening yesterday, so now you\u0027re back bright and early to see it happen again at eight this morning. Missing a crummy help-yourself-in-the-lobby motel breakfast is a small price to pay for that kind of certainty. So is the long, long drive into position. You\u0027re not dumb enough to rent a room anywhere close by.\n And you\u0027re not dumb enough to take a direct route, either. You wind your way through the mountains and leave your car on a gravel turnout a half-mile from your spot. The car is safe enough there. The only reason they built the turnout in the first place is that ass-holes are always leaving their cars there while they go watching eagles or scrambling over rocks or hiking up and down. A rental car parked neatly on the gravel is as invisible as the ski bags on the airport carousel. Just part of the scenery.\n You climb away from the road up a small hill maybe a hundred feet high. There are scrawny trees all over the place, a little more than shoulder high. They have no leaves, but the terrain keeps you concealed. You\u0027re in a kind of wide trench. You step left and right to pass tumbled boulders. At the top of the hill you follow the ridge to the left. You duck low as the ground starts to fall away on the other side. You drop to your knees and shuffle forward to where two giant rocks rest on each other, giving a wonderful random view of the valley through the triangle they make between them. You lean your right shoulder on the right-hand rock and Lieutenant Rita Scimeca\u0027s house slides into the exact center of your field of view, just a little more than two hundred yards away.\n The house is slightly north and west of your position, so you\u0027re getting a full-frontal of the street side. It\u0027s maybe three hundred feet down the mountain, so the whole thing is laid out like a plan. The Bureau car is right there, parked outside. A clean Buick, dark blue. One agent in it. You use your field glasses. The guy is still awake. His head is upright. He\u0027s not looking around much. Just staring forward, bored out of his skull. You can\u0027t blame him. Twelve hours through the night, in a place where the last big excitement was somebody\u0027s Christmas bake sale.\n It\u0027s cold in the hills. The rock is sucking heat out of your shoulder. There\u0027s no sun. Just sullen clouds stacked up over the giant peaks. You turn away for a moment and pull on your gloves. Pull your muffler up over the lower half of your face. Partly for the warmth, partly to break up the clouds of steam your breathing is creating in the air. You turn back. Move your feet and squirm around. Get comfortable. You raise the glasses again.\n The house has a wire fence all the way around the perimeter of the yard. There\u0027s an opening onto a driveway. The driveway is short. A single garage door stands at the end of it, under the end of the front porch. There\u0027s a path off the driveway that loops around through some neat rockery planting to the front door. The Bureau car is parked at the sidewalk right across the driveway opening, just slightly up the hill from dead center. Facing down the rise. That puts the driver\u0027s line of vision directly in line with the mouth of the path. Intelligent positioning. If you walk up the hill to the house, he sees you coming all the way. You come on him from behind, he maybe spots you in his mirror, and he sees you for certain as soon as you pass him by. Then he gets a clear back view all the way as you walk up the looping path. Intelligent positioning, but that\u0027s the Bureau for you.\n You see movement a half-mile to the west and two hundred feet farther down the mountain. A black-and-white Crown Victoria, nosing through a right-angle turn. Prowling, slow. It snuffles through the turns and enters her road. A cloud of white vapor trails from the tailpipe. The engine is cold. The car has been parked up all night behind a quiet station house. It comes up the street and slows and stops flank to flank with the Buick. The cars are a foot apart. You don\u0027t see it for sure but you know the windows are buzzing down. Greetings are being exchanged. Information is being passed on. It\u0027s all quiet, the Bureau guy is saying. Have a nice day, he\u0027s adding. The local cop is grunting. Pretending to be bored, while secretly he\u0027s thrilled to have an important mission. Maybe the first he\u0027s ever had. See you later, the Bureau guy is saying.\n The black-and-white moves up the hill and turns in the road. The Buick\u0027s engine starts and the car lurches as the agent slams it into drive. The black-and-white noses in behind it. The Buick moves away down the hill. The black-and-white rolls forward and stops. Exactly where the Buick was, inch for inch. It bounces twice on its springs and settles. The motor stops. The white vapor drifts and disappears. The cop turns his head to the right and gets exactly the same view of the path the Bureau guy had gotten. Maybe not such a dumb-ass, after all.\n HARPER DROVE THE Maxima into a commercial parking garage on West Ninth Street, right after Reacher told her the grid pattern was about to finish and the street layout was about to get messy. They walked back east and south and found a bistro with a view of Washington Square Park. The waitress had a copy of a digest-sized philosophy journal to lean her order pad on. A student from NYU, making ends meet. The air was cold, but the sun was out. The sky was blue.\n \"I like it here,\" Harper said. \"Great city.\"\n \"I told Jodie I\u0027m selling the house,\" Reacher said.\n She looked across at him. \"She OK with that?\"\n He shrugged. \"She\u0027s worried. I don\u0027t see why. It makes me a happier person, how can that worry her?\"\n \"Because it makes you a footloose person.\"\n \"It won\u0027t change anything.\"\n \"So why do it?\"\n \"That\u0027s what she said.\"\n Harper nodded. \"She would. People do things for a reason, right? So she\u0027s thinking, what\u0027s the reason here?\"\n \"Reason is I don\u0027t want to own a house.\"\n \"But reasons have layers. That\u0027s only the top layer. She\u0027s asking herself, OK, why doesn\u0027t he want to own a house?\"\n \"Because I don\u0027t want the hassle. She knows that. I told her.\"\n \"Bureaucratic type of hassle?\"\n He nodded. \"It\u0027s a big pain in the ass.\"\n \"Yes, it is. A real big pain in the ass. But she\u0027s thinking bureaucratic hassle is just a kind of symbol for something else.\"\n \"Like what?\"\n \"Like wanting to be footloose.\"\n \"You\u0027re just going around in a circle.\"\n \"I\u0027m just telling you how she\u0027s thinking.\"\n The philosophy student brought coffee and Danish. Left a check written out in a neat, academic hand. Harper picked it up.\n \"I\u0027ll take care of it,\" she said.\n \"OK,\" Reacher said.\n \"You need to convince her,\" Harper said. \"You know, make her believe you\u0027re going to stick around, even though you\u0027re selling the house.\"\n \"I told her I\u0027m selling my car too,\" he said.\n She nodded. \"That might help. Sounds like a stick-around thing to do.\"\n He paused for a beat.\n \"I told her I might travel a little,\" he said.\n She stared at him. \"Christ, Reacher, that\u0027s not very reassuring, is it?\"\n \"She travels. She\u0027s been to London twice this year. I didn\u0027t make a big fuss about it?\"\n \"How much do you plan to travel?\"\n He shrugged again. \"I don\u0027t know. A little, I guess. I like getting around. I really do. I told you that.\"\n Harper was quiet for a second.\n \"You know what?\" she said. \"Before you convince her you\u0027re going to stick around, maybe you should convince yourself.\"\n \"I am convinced.\"\n \"Are you? Or do you figure you\u0027ll be in and out, as and when?\"\n \"In and out a little, I guess.\"\n \"You\u0027ll drift apart.\"\n \"That\u0027s what she said.\"\n Harper nodded. \"Well, I\u0027m not surprised.\"\n He said nothing. Just drank his coffee and ate his Danish.\n \"It\u0027s make-your-mind-up time,\" Harper said. \"On the road or off the road, you can\u0027t do both together.\"\n HIS LUNCH BREAK will be the first big test. That\u0027s your preliminary conclusion. At first you wondered about bathroom arrangements, but he just went inside and used hers. He got out of the car after about ninety minutes, after his morning coffee had worked its way through. He stood stretching on the sidewalk. Then he walked up the looping path and rang the doorbell. You adjusted the focus on the field glasses and got a pretty good side view. You didn\u0027t see her. She stayed in the house. You saw his body language, a little awkward, a little embarrassed. He didn\u0027t speak. He didn\u0027t ask. Just presented himself at the door. So the arrangement had been set up ahead of time. Tough on Scimeca, you think to yourself, psychologically speaking. A raped woman, random intrusion of a large male person for some explicit penis-based activity. But it happened smoothly enough. He went in, and the door closed, a minute passed, the door opened again, and he came back out. He walked back to the car, looking around some, paying attention. He opened the car door, slid inside, and the scene went back to normal.\n So, no opportunity with the bathroom breaks. His lunch break would be the next chance. No way the guy is going twelve hours without eating. Cops are always eating. That\u0027s your experience. Doughnuts, pastries, coffee, steak and eggs. Always eating.\n HARPER WANTED A view of the city. She was like a tourist. Reacher walked her south through Washington Square Park and all the way down West Broadway to the World Trade Center. It was about a mile and three quarters. They sauntered slowly and spent fifty minutes doing it. The sky was bright and cold and the city was teeming. Harper was enjoying it.\n \"We could go up to the restaurant,\" Reacher said. \"Bureau could buy me lunch.\"\n \"I just bought you lunch,\" Harper said.\n \"No, that was a late breakfast.\"\n \"You\u0027re always eating,\" she said.\n \"I\u0027m a big guy,\" he said. \"I need nutrition.\"\n They checked their coats in the lobby and rode up to the top of the building. Waited in line at the restaurant desk, with Harper pressed up against the wall of windows, gazing out at the view. She showed her badge and they got a table for two, right at a window facing directly back up West Broadway and Fifth Avenue beyond, from a quarter-mile high.\n \"Awesome,\" she said.\n It was awesome. The air was crisp and clear and the view extended a hundred miles. The city was khaki far below them in the fall light. Packed, intricate, infinitely busy. The rivers were green and gray. The outer boroughs faded into Westchester and Connecticut and Long Island. In the other direction, New Jersey crowded the bank and curved away in the far distance.\n \"Bob\u0027s over there,\" she said.\n \"Someplace,\" Reacher agreed.\n \"Who is Bob?\"\n \"He\u0027s an asshole.\"\n She smiled. \"Not a very exact description, criminologically speaking.\"\n \"He\u0027s a storeman,\" Reacher said. \"A nine-to-five guy, if he\u0027s in the bar every night.\"\n \"He\u0027s not our guy, right?\"\n He\u0027s nobody\u0027s guy, Reacher thought.\n \"He\u0027s small-time,\" he said. \"Selling out of the trunk of his car in the parking lot? No ambition. Not enough at stake to make it worth killing people.\"\n \"So how can he help us?\"\n \"He can name names. He\u0027s got suppliers, and he knows who the other players are. One of the other players will name more names, and then another and another. \"\n \"They all know each other?\"\n Reacher nodded. \"They carve it up. They have specialties and territories, same as anybody else.\"\n \"Could take us a long time.\"\n \"I like the geography here,\" Reacher said.\n \"The geography? Why?\"\n \"It makes sense. You\u0027re in the Army, you want to steal weapons, where do you steal them from? You don\u0027t creep around the barracks at night and pull them out from every footlocker you see. That way, you get yourself about eight hours\u0027 grace until the guys wake up and say hey, where\u0027s my damn Beretta?\"\n \"So where do you steal them from?\"\n \"Someplace they won\u0027t be missed, which means storage. Find a stockpile facility where they\u0027re laid up ready for the next war.\"\n \"And where are those?\"\n \"Look at an interstate map.\"\n \"Why interstate?\"\n \"Why do you think the interstates were built? Not so the Harper family could drive from Aspen to Yellowstone Park on vacation. So the Army could move troops and weapons around, fast and easy.\"\n \"They were?\"\n Reacher nodded. \"Sure they were. Eisenhower built them in the fifties, height of the Cold War thing, and Eisenhower was a West Pointer, first and last.\"\n \"So?\"\n \"So you look where the interstates all meet. That\u0027s where they put the storage, so the stuff can go any which way, moment\u0027s notice. Mostly just behind the coasts, because old Ike wasn\u0027t too worried about parachutists dropping into Kansas. He was thinking of ships coming in from the sea.\"\n \"And Jersey is good for that?\"\n Reacher nodded again. \"Great strategic location. Therefore lots of storage, therefore lots of theft.\"\n \"Therefore Bob might know something?\"\n \"He\u0027ll point us in a new direction. That\u0027s about all we can count on from Bob.\"\n HIS LUNCH BREAK is no good. No good at all. You keep the field glasses tight to your eyes and watch the whole thing happen. A second black-and-white prowl car noses around the corner and moves slowly up the hill. It stops flank to flank against the first one and stays there, motor running. Two of the damn things, side by side. Probably the whole of the police department\u0027s fleet, right there in front of you.\n You get a partial view. The driver\u0027s window is down on both cars. There\u0027s a brown paper sack and a closed cup of coffee. The new guy lifts them across the gap, elbow high to keep them upright. You adjust the focus on the field glasses. You see the waiting cop reach out. The scene is flat and two-dimensional and grainy, like the optics are at their limit. The cop takes the coffee first. His head turns as he finds the cup holder inside. Then he takes the bag. He props it on the ledge of his door and unrolls the top. Glances down. Smiles. He has a big, meaty face. He\u0027s looking at a cheeseburger or something. Maybe two of them, and a wedge of pie.\n He rolls the top of the sack again and swings it inside. Almost certainly dumps it on his passenger seat. Then his head is moving. They\u0027re chatting. The cop is animated. He\u0027s a young guy. The flesh of his face is tight with youth. He\u0027s full of himself. Enchanted with his important mission. You watch him for a long moment. Watch the happy expression on his face. Wonder what that face will look like when he walks to her door for a bathroom break and gets no reply to his knock. Because right there and then you decide two things. You\u0027re going in there, to do the job. And you\u0027re going to work it without killing the cop first, just because you want to see that expression change.\n THE NISSAN MAXIMA was briefly a drug dealers\u0027 favorite ride, so Reacher felt OK about using it to get out to the Jersey bar. It would look innocent enough parked in the lot. It would look real. Unmarked government cars never did. A normal person spends twenty grand on a sedan, he goes ahead and orders the chrome wheels and the pearl coat along with it. But the government never did, so their cars looked obvious, artificially plain, like they had big signs painted on the side saying this is a police unmarked. And if Bob saw such a thing in the lot, he\u0027d break the habit of a lifetime and spend his evening someplace else.\n Reacher drove. Harper preferred not to, not in the dark and the rush hour. And rush hour was bad. Traffic was slow up the spine of Manhattan and jammed at the entrance to the tunnel. Reacher played with the radio and found a station where a woman was telling him how long he was going to have to wait. Forty, forty-five minutes. That was about twice as slow as walking, which was exactly how it felt.\n They inched forward, deep under the Hudson River. His backyard was sixty miles upstream. He sat there and traced its contours in his mind, testing his decision. It was a nice enough yard, as yards go. Certainly it was fertile. You turned your head, the grass was a foot high when you turned it back. It had a lot of trees. Maples, which had been cute in the early fall. Cedars, which Leon must have planted himself, because they were placed in artful groups. Leaves came off the maples and little purple berries came off the cedars. When the leaves were down, there was a wide view of the opposite bank of the river. West Point was right there, and West Point had been an important part of Reacher\u0027s life.\n But he was not a nostalgic guy. Part of being a drifter means you look forward, not backward. You concentrate on what\u0027s ahead. And he felt in his gut that a big part of looking ahead was looking for newness. Looking for places you hadn\u0027t been and things you hadn\u0027t seen. And the irony of his life was that although he had covered most of the earth\u0027s surface, one time or another, he felt he hadn\u0027t seen much. A lifetime in the service was like rushing down a narrow corridor, eyes fixed firmly to the front. There was all kinds of enticing stuff off to the sides, which you rushed past and ignored. Now he wanted to take the side trips. He wanted a crazy zigzag, any direction he felt like, any old time he wanted.\n And returning to the same place every night wouldn\u0027t do it. So his decision was the right one. He said the words to himself. Sell the house. The house is on the market. The house is for sale. The house is sold. He said the words and a weight came up off of him. It wasn\u0027t just the practical weight, although that was important. No more fretting about leaks in the pipes and bills in the mail and oil deliveries and insurance coverage. It was the release. Like he was back in the world, unburdened. He was free and ready to go. It was like a door opening and sunlight flooding in. He smiled to himself in the thrumming darkness of the tunnel, Harper at his side.\n \"You actually enjoying this?\" she said.\n \"Best mile of my life,\" he answered.\n YOU WAIT ANDand you watch, hour after hour. Perfectionism like that, you don\u0027t find everywhere. But you are perfect, and you have to stay perfect. You have to stay sure. And by now you\u0027re sure the cop is a permanent fixture. He eats in his car, he uses her bathroom from time to time, and that\u0027s it. So you think about hijacking the cop, maybe tomorrow morning, just before eight o\u0027clock, and impersonating him. Replacing him on duty. You think about sitting in his car for a spell and then walking up to Scimeca\u0027s door and knocking, like you were ready to relieve yourself. You think about that for around a second and a half, and then you reject it, of course. His uniform wouldn\u0027t fit. And you\u0027d be expected to chat with the Bureau guy at the eight o\u0027clock handover. He\u0027d know you were a fake, straight off the bat. It\u0027s not like he\u0027s dealing with a big anonymous police department like he\u0027d get in New York or L.A.\n So either the cop has to be moved, or you have to go in right past him. At first you toy with the idea of a diversion. What would it take to get him out of there? A major automobile accident at the crossroads, maybe. A fire in the school, perhaps. But as far as you know the village doesn\u0027t have a school. You\u0027ve seen yellow buses on the road, heading in and out toward Portland. The school is probably in another jurisdiction. And an automobile accident would be hard to stage. Certainly you\u0027re not about to involve yourself in one. And how do you induce two other drivers to get in a crash?\n Maybe a bomb threat. But where? At the station house? That would be no good. The cop would be told to stay where he was, safely out of the way, until it was checked out. So where else? Some spot where people are gathered, maybe. Somewhere the whole police department would be needed to handle the evacuation. But this is a tiny place. Where do people gather? The church, maybe. You can see a spire, down near the through road. But you can\u0027t wait until next Sunday. The library? Probably nobody in there. Two old dears at most, sitting there doing their needlepoint, ignoring the books. Evacuation could be handled by the other cop on his own in about three and a half seconds.\n And a bomb threat would mean a phone call. You start to think about that. Where from? Calls can be traced. You could head back to the airport in Portland and call from there. Tracing a call to an airport pay phone is the same thing as not tracing it at all. But then you\u0027re miles out of position at the critical time. A safe call, but a useless call. Catch-22. And there are no pay phones within a million miles of where you\u0027re crouched, not in the middle of the damn Rocky Mountains or whatever the hell they call them. And you can\u0027t use your mobile, because eventually the call would appear on your bill, which ultimately is the same thing as a confession in open court. And who can you call? You can\u0027t allow anybody to hear your voice. It\u0027s too distinctive. Too dangerous.\n But the more you think about it, the more your strategy centers around the phone. There\u0027s one person you can safely let hear your voice. But it\u0027s a geometric problem. Four dimensional. Time and space. You have to call from right here, in the open, within sight of the house, but you can\u0027t use your mobile. Impasse.\n THEY DROVE OUT of the tunnel and streamed west with the traffic. Route 3 angled slightly north toward the Turnpike. It was a shiny night in New Jersey, damp asphalt everywhere, sodium lights with evening fog haloes strung like necklaces. There were lit billboards and neon signs left and right. Establishments of every nature behind lumpy blacktop yards.\n The roadhouse they were looking for was in the back of a leftover lot where three roads met. It was labeled with a beer company\u0027s neon sign which said Mac-Stiophan\u0027s, which as far as Reacher understood Gaelic meant Stevenson\u0027s. It was a low building with a flat roof. Its walls were faced with brown boards and there was a green neon shamrock in every window. Its parking lot was badly lit and three-quarters empty. Reacher put the Maxima at a casual angle across two spaces near the door. Slid out and looked around. The air was cold. He turned a full circle in the dark, scanning the lot against the lights from the street.\n \"No Cadillac DeVille,\" he said. \"He\u0027s not here yet.\"\n Harper looked at the door, cautiously.\n \"We\u0027re a little early,\" she said. \"I guess we\u0027ll wait.\"\n \"You can wait out here,\" he said. \"If you prefer.\"\n She shook her head.\n \"I\u0027ve been in worse places,\" she said.\n It was hard for Reacher to imagine where and when. The outer door led to a six-by-six lobby with a cigarette machine and a sisal mat worn smooth and greasy with use. The inner door led to a low dark space full of the stink of beer fumes and smoke. There was no ventilation running. The green shamrocks in the windows shone inward as well as outward and gave the place a pale ghostly glare. The walls were dark boards, dulled and sticky with fifty years of cigarettes. The bar was a long wooden structure with halved barrels stuck to the front. There were tall barstools with red vinyl seats and lower versions of the same thing scattered around the room near tables built of lacquered barrels with plywood circles nailed to their tops. The plywood was rubbed smooth and dirty from thousands of wrists and hands.\n There was a bartender behind the bar and eight customers in the body of the room. All of them had glasses of beer set on the plywood in front of them. All of them were men. All of them were staring at the new-comers. None of them was a soldier. They were all wrong for the military. Some were too old, some were too soft, some had long dirty hair. Just ordinary workingmen. Or maybe unemployed. But they were all hostile. They were silent, like they had just stopped talking in the middle of low muttered sentences. They were staring, like they were trying to intimidate.\n Reacher swept his gaze over all of them, pausing on each face, long enough to let them know he wasn\u0027t impressed, and short enough to stop them thinking he was in any way interested. Then he stepped to the bar and rolled a stool out for Harper.\n \"What\u0027s on draft?\" he asked the bartender.\n The guy was wearing an unwashed dress shirt with no collar. Pleats all the way down the front. He had a dish towel squared over his shoulder. He was maybe fifty, gray-faced, paunchy. He didn\u0027t answer.\n \"What have you got?\" Reacher asked again.\n No reply.\n \"Hey, are you deaf?\" Harper called to the guy.\n She was half on and half off the stool, one foot on the floor, the other on the rung. Her jacket was draped open and she was twisting around from the waist. Her hair was loose down her back.\n \"Let\u0027s make a deal,\" she said. \"You give us beer, we give you money, take it from there. Maybe you could turn it into a business, you know, call it running a saloon.\"\n The guy turned to her.\n \"Haven\u0027t seen you in here before,\" he said.\n Harper smiled. \"No, we\u0027re new customers. That\u0027s what it\u0027s all about, expanding your customer base, right? Do it well enough, and you\u0027ll be the barroom king of the Garden State, no time at all.\"\n \"What do you want?\" the guy said.\n \"Two beers,\" Reacher said.\n \"Apart from that?\"\n \"Well, we\u0027re already enjoying the ambiance and the friendly welcome.\"\n \"People like you don\u0027t come in a place like mine without wanting something.\"\n \"We\u0027re waiting for Bob,\" Harper said.\n \"Bob who?\"\n \"Bob with real short hair and an old Cadillac DeVille, \" Reacher said. \"Bob from the Army, comes in here eight o\u0027clock every night.\"\n \"You\u0027re waiting for him?\"\n \"Yes, we\u0027re waiting for him,\" Harper said.\n The guy smiled. Yellow teeth, some of them missing.\n \"Well, you\u0027ve got a long wait, then,\" he said.\n \"Why?\"\n \"Buy a drink, and I\u0027ll tell you.\"\n \"We\u0027ve been trying to buy a drink for the last five minutes,\" Reacher said.\n \"What do you want?\"\n \"Two beers,\" Reacher said. \"Whatever\u0027s on tap.\"\n \"Bud or Bud Light.\"\n \"One of each, OK?\"\n The guy took two glasses down from an overhead rack and filled them. The room was still silent. Reacher could feel eight pairs of eyes on his back. The guy placed the beers on the bar. There was an inch of soapy foam on the top of each of them. The guy peeled two cocktail napkins from a stack and dealt them out like cards. Harper pulled a wallet from her pocket and dropped a ten between the glasses.\n \"Keep the change,\" she said. \"So why have we got a long wait for Bob?\"\n The guy smiled again and slid the ten backward. Folded it into his hand and put his hand in his pocket.\n \"Because Bob\u0027s in jail, far as I know,\" he said.\n \"What for?\"\n \"Some Army thing,\" the guy said. \"I don\u0027t know the details, and I don\u0027t want to know the details. That\u0027s how you do business in this part of the Garden State, miss, begging your damn pardon, your fancy ideas notwithstanding. \"\n \"What happened?\" Reacher asked.\n \"Military policemen came in and grabbed him up right here, right in this room.\"\n \"When?\" Reacher asked.\n \"Took six of them to get him.
