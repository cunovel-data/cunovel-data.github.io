{"id":31476,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II A LIE THAT IS HALF A TRUTH","content":"I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt. Genesis. Trent lay as he had fallen, with his head on the fender, in a pool of blood which slowly enlarged itself and sopped into the carpet. The sharp edge had fractured his skull. He was stone dead, beyond possibility of doubt, yet both men by a common instinct knelt down and tried to loosen his collar. The heavy head tumbled sideways, against Denis\u0027s arm. He sprang up and retreated, with a violent shudder. \"Poor beggar! Poor beggar!\" said Gardiner under his breath. \"I never saw anything so ghastly in my life! This thing\u0027s like a razor.\" He ran his finger down the edge of the fender. \"Good Lord! what an appalling business! Well, I suppose the first thing is to have in the doctor; he can\u0027t do any good, of course, but still—Luckily there\u0027s one actually staying in the house. Ring the bell, do you mind, Denis? Or, wait a bit, I don\u0027t want the maids poking round; I\u0027ll go myself.\" He was half-way to the door when Denis seized his arm. \"Stop a minute, Harry. Think.\" \"What\u0027s the use of waiting? May as well get it over!\" \"No; but think—think! Can\u0027t you see what this means?\" His agitation was contagious. \"I can see it\u0027s going to be very awkward with the house full of visitors, but it\u0027s not the time to think of that, is it? What the devil are you driving at?\" \"You killed him,\" said Denis baldly. [Pg 13] \"I did not!\" \"You did. It\u0027s manslaughter, if not murder. It might mean hanging, and it\u0027ll pretty certainly mean prison.\" \"Prison!\" Every trace of color went out of Gardiner\u0027s face. In the momentary pause some one tapped at the door. Gardiner wrenched himself free, and Denis sprang to shut out the intruder; but he was too late. The door, left unlatched by Miss Marvin, slid open at a touch. There stood Mrs. Trent, in her long muffling cloak and veil; she had come in quest of her husband. Denis tried ineffectually to block out the view of the room, the lamp on the floor, the dead man, and Gardiner. \"You—you mustn\u0027t come in, Mrs. Trent. Your husband\u0027s had a sort of seizure—\" She said nothing, only plucked at his arm, struggling against it, her eyes, her whole being concentrated on the figure on the floor. Suddenly diving under the barrier, she fled to his side and sank down, a mere swirl of draperies. Denis, distracted, stooped over her. \"Don\u0027t—don\u0027t!\" he said. \"Let us fetch a doctor—perhaps he\u0027s only fainted—\" \"Fainted!\" She raised her tragic little head; her eyes, ranging round the room, met and fixed on Gardiner. \"He\u0027s been murdered!\" she cried out. \"Murdered—and you did it, you!\" The imaginative man is at the mercy of his nerves; there is always an unsound link in his courage, liable to snap at any unexpected strain. It is a question of sheer luck whether he finds out his weakness and is able to take precautions beforehand. The unimaginative man never understands this. To Denis\u0027s infinite dismay, Gardiner simply backed into the corner, throwing up his arm as if to ward a blow. Denis himself cried out the first denial that rose to his lips. \"Mrs. Trent, it was an accident, I give you my word it was!\" \"It was murder,\" she contradicted swiftly, her young[Pg 14] voice gathering depth and force, scorn and anguish, her outstretched finger quivering. \"He did it, he killed him, I read it in his eyes. Oh, he was all I had in the world, and you\u0027ve taken him away! Oh, what shall I do—what shall I do?\" \"Harry! Say something—tell her it\u0027s a mistake!\" \"He can\u0027t!\" cried the girl. \"Look, look at him cowering there! Murderer! He daren\u0027t face me—he can\u0027t deny it!\" Less of his own will than because Denis\u0027s hands were on his shoulders, Gardiner slowly turned. He looked hang-dog. \"I didn\u0027t do it!\" he muttered, his eyes on the ground. \"You heard what my friend said—it was an accident!\" And then more loudly, gaining confidence: \"I swear I never laid a finger on him—did I, Denis? I would have said so before—I would have explained at once, if I\u0027d taken in what you were saying.\" \"You didn\u0027t lay a finger on him?\" Mrs. Trent laughed out, a queer high note of triumph. \"Ah—but you killed him all the same! I know! I can prove it! What I have here—Besides, look, look at his darling face—Oh, Guy!\" The name broke from her in a great tremulous convulsive sob. She put out her hands blindly, clutching the edge of the table. \"Oh, what is it? Oh, oh, it hurts!—I\u0027m frightened—Louisa!\" \"Great heavens! Ring the bell, Denis—quick!\" Denis nearly brought down the bell-rope. The next minutes were all confusion. People gathered like flies: the boots, Miss Marvin, half-a-dozen frightened servants, at last Mrs. Trent\u0027s elderly maid. She threw up her hands in horror, but she wasted no time on the dead man; her concern was all for her mistress. \"Come away, Miss Dot dear, come! \u0027Tain\u0027t fit for you here!\" The girl, shaken now by terrifying sobs, suffered herself to be led away; their steps died out down the passage. Meanwhile the doctor had arrived, a brusque and dapper little man, hastily fetched in from the terrace. Gardiner, who was everywhere at once, arranging everything, cleared[Pg 15] the room for him to make his examination, leaving only Denis, Miss Marvin, and himself. \"Fracture of the base of the skull. No, I couldn\u0027t have done anything even if I\u0027d been on the spot; must have been practically instantaneous. Slipped, you say, did he? H\u0027m!\" He bent to sniff at the dead man\u0027s lips. \"Where was he standing?\" Gardiner reconstructed the scene, exact in every detail save one. \"He came across to the table, to fill his glass, I suppose, and seemed to lose his balance—his feet flew up in the air. We didn\u0027t think anything of it, did we, Denis? It was the most ordinary tumble.\" \"Didn\u0027t strike against anything in falling, did he?\" \"No; he went flat on his back, as you do on a slide.\" \"Sure? Well, how do you account for that, then?\" He pointed to a tiny star of blood on the dead man\u0027s forehead. Gardiner looked as he felt, nonplussed. \"I can\u0027t account for it.\" \"You can\u0027t, hey? Your friend, then—he any idea?\" \"No,\" said Denis from the window, without turning round. There was an uncomfortable pause. \"What\u0027s all this mess of glass about?\" asked Miss Marvin, who was listening with all her intelligent ears. \"I don\u0027t know—yes, I do, though; Major Trent had been having a whisky and soda, and dropped the tumbler as he fell. I remember hearing it smash.\" \"There you are, then, sir. A bit flew up and hit him. There\u0027s nothing cuts worse than broken glass, and the splinters they\u0027ll fly anywhere, they\u0027re that light and frivolous things. Why, I\u0027ve nearly had my own eye out, falling up the pantry steps with a tray in my arms! That\u0027s what done it, you may depend.\" Thus Miss Marvin, practical and positive. Little Dr. Scott nodded assent. \"H\u0027m, yes; might have been that. The fellow was half tipsy, of course. No need to tell his wife so, but he smells like a pot-house. She seems to take it pretty queerly, by the way, from the glimpse I had of her,\" he added, bending[Pg 16] his bright and piercing eyes on Gardiner. \"Has a special grudge against you, hey?\" \"She accused me downright of murdering him at first,\" said the young man soberly. \"Heaven knows why, for I\u0027d never set eyes on either of them before. I hope she won\u0027t keep it up; it\u0027s rather a serious thing to have laid to one\u0027s charge. But I suppose I\u0027d better take no notice; women in her state of health often take queer fancies into their heads, don\u0027t they?\" \"Hey? Is that so? Poor child, poor child! I hope we shan\u0027t have any further trouble with her. It\u0027s a bad piece of work altogether,\" he added, getting up and dusting his knees. \"You know, of course, that the body mustn\u0027t be moved till the police have seen it. You\u0027ve sent for them, I suppose?\" \"No, I haven\u0027t.\" \"You haven\u0027t? What are you staring for? Have to be an inquest, won\u0027t there? Can\u0027t give the certificate without it, can I?\" snapped the little man; and then, lowering his voice out of respect for the dead: \"You and your long-legged friend over there, who looks as if he\u0027d be the better for a nip of sal volatile, you\u0027ll have to give evidence. Any one would think you\u0027d never heard of an inquest before!\" \"Of course. I was an ass not to think of it, but you see it\u0027s awkward for me, with the house full of people. However, that can\u0027t be helped. I\u0027ll telephone at once. Yes, what is it?\" Mrs. Trent\u0027s maid, at the door, had a very grave face. \"Can the doctor please come at once, sir? My mistress is taken ill.\" The two men were left alone. Denis, who had been standing at the open window all this time, with his back to the room, turned round now to see Gardiner on his knees, hunting over the floor. \"What are you doing?\" he asked, breaking his long silence. \"Looking for my chisel. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll leave that for the police to find.\" [Pg 17] The little doctor\u0027s jibe about sal volatile had not been baseless. Denis, though in his youth he had been through a frontier campaign which should have cured him of such weakness, looked and felt rather sick. Gardiner was less sensitive. He pursued his search without qualms. Denis watched him. \"What are you goin\u0027 to say to the police when they do come?\" \"What you said to Mrs. Trent. You began it, Denis.\" \"You\u0027ll have to give evidence on oath at the inquest.\" \"That won\u0027t trouble my conscience.\" \"I suppose they\u0027ll call me as well.\" \"Safe to,\" assented Gardiner. Denis said nothing. The younger man, looking up, asked with a certain hardihood: \"Are you going to give me away?\" \"I won\u0027t if I can help it.\" \"By which you mean—?\" \"If I\u0027m asked right out, Did you throw the chisel at him? I\u0027ll have to say Yes; but short of that I\u0027ll do all I can to get you out of the scrape. I\u0027d have been in it myself if I\u0027d been standin\u0027 where you were.\" \"Only you\u0027d have owned up at once, whereas I\u0027m not going to,\" said Gardiner, with a short laugh. \"I might have known you couldn\u0027t tell a lie, Denis. Here, I can\u0027t find this confounded thing. Where the devil can it have got to?\" Denis, putting his qualms in his pocket, went down on his knees and joined in the search. They looked all over the room, in every corner. \"I should say it must be underneath him,\" said Gardiner, with a reflective glance at the body, \"but I don\u0027t know that I exactly want to look and see.\" Denis with an uncontrollable shudder got up and retreated to the window. \"How can you talk like this? You make me sick!\" \"My good Denis, I don\u0027t feel like a murderer before the corpse of his victim, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re driving at! I deny that I was in the least to blame. Anybody with a[Pg 18] spark of decent feeling must have done what I did. If he broke his head, poor brute, that wasn\u0027t my fault; it\u0027s what you might call the act of God. I\u0027m not going to prison, if I can help it, for a crime I haven\u0027t committed. In the meantime, I want my chisel.\" \"Well, it\u0027s not—where you suggest,\" said Denis with an effort, \"for I remember seeing it after he fell.\" \"You did? Then it must be here somewhere!\" But it was not. \"What the devil can have come to it?\" said Gardiner, biting his mustache, and betraying his agitation by his language; for he did not usually swear. \"Mrs. Trent was kneelin\u0027 over that side.\" \"What, do you think she\u0027s got it up her sleeve? But in that case why didn\u0027t she bring it out and denounce me? Here, you\u0027d better have a peg, Denis, you look as though you wanted one. What the deuce should she carry it away with her for?\" \"I don\u0027t know; but it struck me she had something on the tip of her tongue to say just before she collapsed. Perhaps she meant to produce it, and then felt too sick.\" There was a short silence. Denis sipped the whisky which his friend had forced on him. It was not so much Trent\u0027s death which had upset him, as Gardiner\u0027s failure, and the part which it forced him to play. He hated any contact with deception. \"Well, this is a sweet prospect,\" said Gardiner, with another short laugh. \"Mrs. Trent, and you—let\u0027s hope the coroner won\u0027t ask awkward questions! Come on out now; it\u0027s no use hunting for a thing that isn\u0027t there. I\u0027ll lock up the room and summon the minions of the law.\" \"I wish you\u0027d own up.\" \"Oh, confound you for a prig, Denis! I can\u0027t go back on what I\u0027ve said, can I? It might perhaps have been better if I\u0027d done it at first, but I\u0027m committed to it now. I must just go on and trust to luck. It was you began it; don\u0027t you forget that!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3250/89040.html","bookId":604,"book":{"id":604,"title":"Convict B14","description":"简介： When men shall say, Peace, and all things are safe, then shall sudden destruction come upon them, as sorrow cometh upon a woman travailing with child, and they shall not escape....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3250","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:01 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:01 AM"}}
