{"id":31505,"no":31,"title":"CHAPTER XXXI THE LUCKIEST GIRL IN THE WORLD","content":"What\u0027s death?—You\u0027ll love me yet! Pippa Passes. \"Lettice, I\u0027ve been down to Poupehan!\" Lettice was darning her stockings in the shade of the tower. Lettice would have darned her stockings on the Judgment Day. She suspended her work to look up, slowly, at Dorothea. Rose-brown, panting from the steep hill, lips laughing, eyes sparkling with excitement, she flung herself down among the stubble and the pink convolvuluses and fanned her face with her handkerchief. \"Oh, I\u0027m so hot! I ran nearly the whole way. I went to try for a paper, and I fell over M. Lapouse, and oh, Lettice, what do you think he told me? There\u0027s been a French plane brought down near Florenville, and the pilot\u0027s escaped, and they\u0027re hunting him all over the place! Oh! don\u0027t you hope he\u0027ll get away?\" Lettice remained looking at her for a minute, then lowered her eyes and slowly resumed her work. Dorothea flounced away with an energy that upset Madame Hasquin\u0027s workbasket. \"Well, you are a fish! I did think you\u0027d be interested in this. Don\u0027t you want to hear about it? Don\u0027t you care?\" \"Was—was the man hurt?\" asked Lettice. \"No, they don\u0027t think so, or not much—he managed to burn his machine, anyway. Oh! don\u0027t I wish I\u0027d been there! We might have patched her up between us, and flown her to the French lines. Oh! it would have been sport!\" \"It\u0027s, it\u0027s—it\u0027s twenty miles to Florenville, isn\u0027t it?\"[Pg 266] Lettice pursued her train of thought in her own undeviating way. \"Yes, about. Why?\" \"And when did it happen?\" \"When did she come down, do you mean? Yesterday morning. Oh, were you thinking he might have come up here? He never would, Lettice. No such luck! He would make for the Dutch frontier, they always do, M. Lapouse was saying so. They\u0027re hardly even searching west of Bouillon.\" \"O-oh.\" Lettice went on darning. Lettice in those days was hardly a personality. Withdrawn into herself, ensimismada, as Gardiner would have said, for hours on end she did not speak, she scarcely thought; she brooded. Her mind had been bruised and it was numb. She was like an automaton; the one definite feeling that emerged was an unwavering hostility to the destroyers of the Bellevue. Dorothea was compassionate to a fair young hussar who limped to the door one day after a fall from his horse; she gave him breakfast, put his sprained arm in a sling, and sent him on his way with good wishes in valiant German. Lettice made his coffee and broiled his ham—if thine enemy hunger, feed him; but he remained her enemy still. There were no good wishes from her. Dorothea with an enormous sigh pulled over a bunch of stockings for a pillow, and lay back, still panting, hands clasped behind her head. She did not find Lettice a very satisfactory companion in those days. She was not an automaton, far from it! They had been at the farm for several weeks now, and she was wondering how much longer she could stand it. The same view, day after day—the steep down-slope of the meadow, the green velvet crease where the brook ran, the steep up-slope of the harvest field, silvery, with its slowly discoloring sheaves, the spires of the wood against the uneventful azure of the sky—oh dear! She wanted to fight, to defend her country, to stick bayonets into Germans, as they had stuck them into that dead girl[Pg 267] in the woods—as she had already stuck a knife into the Uhlan. She held up her little brown hand; it didn\u0027t seem possible, yet it was true, that that hand had accounted for one of the enemy, and she wasn\u0027t sorry, no, she couldn\u0027t feel one little bit ashamed, though she knew in her heart that at the moment when she pushed the body over the lip of the well she hadn\u0027t been quite sure that it wasn\u0027t still breathing.... She tucked the hand back with a little shudder. That didn\u0027t bear thinking about. \"Well, why didn\u0027t I stick a knife into Lieutenant Müller, then?\" she reflected. Müller was the hussar. \"There\u0027s no sense in me!\" Hot and cold was Dorothea, Charlotte Corday one hour, Florence Nightingale the next. Inaction, presumably the woman\u0027s natural lot, was not natural to her. But for Lettice she would long ago have dressed up in one of Achille\u0027s suits and made a dash for the French lines— \"\u0027Tis but the coat of a page to borrow And tie my hair in a horse-boy\u0027s trim—\" She didn\u0027t love skirts at the best of times— \"And I sit by his side, and laugh at sorrow—\" Denis. All her thoughts always came back to him. Denis was fighting, and she wanted news; oh! she did want news so badly! Tears came hot in her eyes; she turned over and buried her face in the grass, struggling with the sudden pain. Denis was fighting; any one of these blue days he might be dying; he might be already dead. And he hadn\u0027t forgiven her. Oh! she, with this vulture at her heart, how could she sit quiet, brood on still anger, like Lettice? She must be white-washing the kitchen, or helping wounded Germans, or exciting herself over stranded French aeroplanes twenty miles away—anything, anything to get away from her thoughts! \"There\u0027s a man in the wood,\" observed Lettice. She had dropped her work and sat immobile, her intent[Pg 268] gaze probing the shadows of the distant trees. Dorothea with an impatient sigh rolled over and sat up too. \"Where?\" \"There, under that fir-tree—don\u0027t you see him? Now he, he, he\u0027s stooping down behind the bush.\" \"What eyes you have, Lettice!\" said Dorothea, screwing up her own. \"I can\u0027t see any old thing!\" \"I\u0027ve been watching him for some time. I think he\u0027s hiding.\" \"Hiding?\" \"He was there before you came back, and then he got down out of sight. I don\u0027t think he can get away. I think he\u0027s hurt.\" \"Hurt?\" Dorothea repeated wonderingly. \"There\u0027s been a lot of firing this morning down by the river.\" \"But, Lettice, you don\u0027t think—\" Lettice did not say she thought anything. She stuck her needle in her stocking and prepared to get up. She stood a moment shading her eyes, piercing the depths of the pine wood with her far-searching look, and then got under way to descend the hill. Dorothea seized her hand. \"Oh, don\u0027t, Lettice—it\u0027s sure to be some deserter, you know there are heaps, and you haven\u0027t even got your big scissors!\" \"I am going to see if there are any mushrooms on the hill by the crucifix,\" said Lettice in the softly distinct tones which admitted no discussion. \"Well, wait half-a-minute for me, then!\" Lettice did not wait; when Dorothea came running out of the house with the carving-knife tucked inside her blouse, she was already at the white bridge over the brook. Dorothea overtook her half-way across the stubble field. She was making better time up the hill than ever she had before. \"Oh, darling Lettice, don\u0027t, don\u0027t go! Let me—it doesn\u0027t matter about me, I can take care of myself, and I don\u0027t mind things, but you know what it was to you last time! Lettice darling—please!\" [Pg 269] Lettice shook off her hand. \"I saw him again just now,\" she said. \"He was wearing those leather overall things.\" \"Lettice!\" Next moment Dorothea loosed her hold on Lettice and ran on alone. She had seen him too. He came out of the woods towards them, lurching like a drunkard. And Dorothea knew him, spite of disfiguring dust and blood, and his face—that face! His cheek had been sliced open; a flap of raw red flesh hung down over his jaw; his teeth showed white in the gap, like a skeleton\u0027s. He tried to wave back the girls, he tried to speak, a thick jumble of words; his feet dragged heavily together, and down he went, full length in the grass. Dorothea was beside him. She nursed him against her breast, mourning over him with dove-like sounds, kissing away the blood, murmuring exquisite love, warding off friends and foes alike with jealous protecting arms. Lettice knelt at a little distance, sobbing helplessly. \"Lettice!\" What radiant eager purpose! Here was the true Dorothea, come to her own at last, risen to her full stature. \"Help me to lift. They\u0027ll be up here directly, sure to, and we must hide him.\" \"The wood?\" \"No, they\u0027ll search that first. Into the house. Take his feet; I can manage the head.\" They could not have carried Denis—a six-foot man, in his heavy accouterments—they could not have raised him from the ground, in ordinary circumstances. But extraordinary need calls out extraordinary powers. One-half a man\u0027s strength is his conviction of strength. Dorothea lifted the man she loved with her love in addition to her muscles, and Lettice had the strength of endurance, if not that of passion. So they carried him across the bridge and laid him in the round tower among the hay. Dorothea spoke again. \"Get my first-aid things out of the dresser drawer, Lettice, while I see what\u0027s wrong. Quick as you can; we haven\u0027t a second to lose.\" [Pg 270] Lettice obeyed orders. When she came back Dorothea\u0027s uplifted face was sunshine unclouded. \"He\u0027s not going to die!\" she cried, and her voice sang. \"He isn\u0027t even dangerously hurt, it\u0027s only pain and loss of blood. And, Lettice, he\u0027s been telling me—darling, no; don\u0027t, don\u0027t try to talk, it does hurt you so—he\u0027s been telling me he\u0027s been bombing the Zeppelins at Aix! They got them, too, they set one on fire, and the other man got off safe; but Denis had a bullet through his tank. So he made for Rochehaut, but he couldn\u0027t get farther than Florenville, so he burnt his machine and came on on foot. And this morning he saw the Bellevue, and while he was asking about it he was seen, and they hunted him, all among the woods by the river, and he was hit, this\"—she touched the cheek she was bandaging with thistle-down finger—\"I wish I were a doctor, then I\u0027d put some stitches in; it\u0027ll spoil your looks, my darling. Just think, Lettice, he was hiding in the wood, he could actually see us, but he never meant to come out for fear of getting us into a scrape. He meant to lie there till dusk and then get away—if they hadn\u0027t caught him first, which they would have. Watch how this bandage goes, you\u0027ll have to do it when I\u0027m gone.\" She was working as she talked, with perfect swiftness and dexterity. \"I wish, oh! I wish I could stay and see to you myself. Never mind, it can\u0027t be helped. Cover him up with the hay, Lettice—careful! don\u0027t crush it, or it\u0027ll give the show away. They may possibly look in here, for form\u0027s sake.\" She stood up, struggling into the bloodstained coat she had taken from Denis. Lettice stared, bewildered. \"What—what are you going to do?\" \"Lead them off on a false scent, of course,\" said Dorothea—\"the Huns, I mean. Goodness, I shall never get my hair under this cap—where are your scissors?\" \"But—\" Dorothea stamped, sawing at her thick plaits. \"They\u0027ll take me for him, don\u0027t you see? I\u0027ll lead them a lovely goose chase—I bet I know this country better than they do! There\u0027s the Grotte des Fées, if the worst[Pg 271] comes to the worst. They\u0027ll think he\u0027s gone off quite in the other direction—else, do you imagine we\u0027d ever possibly be able to hide him, with the hue and cry there\u0027d be? Good-by, darling, darling—\" She flung herself down beside Denis, lavishing her whole heart on him, baring her soul, unveiling the holy of holies, the white fire of very love. Then, standing up, she held out both hands to Lettice; and in her face, unearthly bright yet grave, Lettice did visibly behold this mortal putting on immortality. \"It\u0027s—it\u0027s a frightful risk,\" she said. Dorothea\u0027s gravity broke up into a laugh of pure glee. \"Yes, that\u0027s the very cream of it!\" she cried. \"Oh! I have wanted to do something like a soldier, and now I\u0027ve got the chance. Oh! and Denis has forgiven me, he\u0027s taken me back again—oh! I do think I\u0027m the very luckiest girl in all the world!\" She caught Lettice close and kissed her vehemently, and then fled down the hill, buckling her cap as she ran. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3250/89069.html","bookId":604,"book":{"id":604,"title":"Convict B14","description":"简介： When men shall say, Peace, and all things are safe, then shall sudden destruction come upon them, as sorrow cometh upon a woman travailing with child, and they shall not escape....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3250","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:01 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:01 AM"}}
