{"id":31507,"no":33,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIII THE ONE SHALL BE TAKEN","content":"If only the dead could find out when To come back and be forgiven! Owen Meredith. \"Are your minds set upon righteousness, O ye congregation?\" inquired Mr. Roche in skeptical tones. It was Sunday morning, and all prisoners having the white Church of England ticket on their doors had been rounded up for the chapel. Not that that was any hardship, for they liked the service; it was commendably short, there were plenty of hymns, and even the lessons, as read by Dr. Scott in his voice of gold, were really quite amusing, especially the chroniques scandaleuses of the Old Testament. By contrast with the bareness of their cells they liked, too, the satins and the embroideries, the lights and the flowers and the incense on which the little doctor squandered most of his pocket-money. He was a believer in the beauty of holiness; he had transformed the bare little barn of a place into a gem. Only the jeweled cross and candlesticks, source of covetous desires in such members of the congregation as did not happen to be set upon righteousness, had been a thank-offering from another donor. \"Psalm 126, the first verse. \u0027When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion—\u0027\" By way of prelude to this boldly hopeful text, Mr. Roche had just announced the fall of Antwerp. Scott did not love the new chaplain, but he could not deny that he preached well, or that he got hold of the men. The atmosphere of the chapel was not as a rule what one might call devotional, but this morning there was a fullness in the responses and a[Pg 282] clean-cut hush during the sermon which rather touchingly reflected the general state of feeling. It was hard in 1914 to be a prisoner, since even criminals may love their country. Several of Scott\u0027s patients had proclaimed their intention of enlisting the moment they were free. As months, or even years, had to elapse before that happy time, these protestations were cheap and safe. Others, who said less, perhaps felt more. Scott had been sorry for many, leashed in by their punishment; for none more than B14. \"Con—found—their—pol—itics, Frus—trate—their—knav—ish tricks—\" The National Anthem having been roared out from throats kept artificially silent during the week, chapel was dismissed, and it was the immediate duty of the medical officer to take the casual sick. Scott made a rush to his house for a glance at The Observer, which did not reach Westby till midday, and was back in the casualty room by a quarter to twelve. He stood at a desk, with Mackenzie, as chief warder, beside him, and a table covered with pills, potions, and ointments ready to hand. One by one, as their names were called, the patients came up for treatment. \"Mason A29, sir.\" Mason advanced, a doleful wisp of a man. \"Well, Mason, what\u0027s the matter with you?\" \"Oh, if you please, sir, I\u0027ve got such a dreadful cold in my head!\" A fruity and exhaustive sniff lent point to the complaint. \"A cold in the head, have you? Give me your hand. Now let\u0027s see your tongue. H\u0027m! Dose of No. 7.\" No. 7 was poured out, Mason choked over it, and was passed out by the opposite door. \"Next,\" said Scott. \"Gardiner B14, sir.\" This was unexpected. Gardiner B14 stood cheerfully submissive, nursing his hand, which was wrapped in his clean Sunday handkerchief. \"Hullo, you in the wars again? What\u0027s the matter now, hey?\" [Pg 283] \"Bad thumb, sir,\" said Gardiner, gingerly unrolling it. Yes, his hand had broken out again. \"I shall have to lance this,\" snapped Scott, and did so, with inward ruth. After twenty years of practice, he still hated inflicting pain. \"What have you been doing to yourself? Why didn\u0027t you come to me before?\" \"Well, sir, I never thought twice about it till this morning. I knocked it on a nail; I thought it would get all right.\" \"Get all right? Get all wrong! Your blood must be in a shocking state. Ever have anything of this sort before you came here?\" \"N-no, I don\u0027t know that I have. I expect perhaps it\u0027s the confinement; I\u0027m not used to it, you know.\" \"H\u0027m! well, your time\u0027s up next month, isn\u0027t it? and then you\u0027ll be free to get some war work, which is what you\u0027re fidgeting after, aren\u0027t you? Take care of that hand, and don\u0027t go jabbing nails into it, unless you want to lose it altogether. Two thousand men of the Naval Division have crossed the Dutch frontier and will have to be interned. Next.\" B14, with the faint suggestion of a smile, went the way of A29, and Scott looked after him with a sigh and the faint suggestion of a frown. Ever since his night in the padded cell it had been the same; Gardiner was polite, and even friendly, but he kept his distance. With no one is a reserved man more reserved than with the person before whom he has once been helplessly open. \"I\u0027ve lost him for good,\" Scott said to himself; and another sigh came, for he had not many friends. But he was right, it was irrevocable; Gardiner had definitively snapped the thread. Sunday is a day of rest. Prisoners attend chapel twice, they have two separate hours of exercise, morning and afternoon; at half-past four they go to their cells for supper, and are then locked up for the night. In winter, all lights are put out. In summer, many read in bed. But on the brightest of June mornings Gardiner\u0027s cell was barely light enough for that; and by five o\u0027clock in October it was as black as a cave. He had finished his supper, and was [Pg 284]screwing up his patience to endure the interminable night, when his door opened to admit that very welcome sight, a visitor—Mr. Roche the chaplain. \"I meant to get round before, but I haven\u0027t had a moment; I\u0027ve been up to my eyes in business the whole day. But I thought I might just catch you before bed-time. How are you, eh?\" \"Very well, thank you, sir. Very glad to see you.\" Gardiner\u0027s manner was an odd blend of orthodox respect and unorthodox friendliness. It had its counterpart in Roche\u0027s own: he could not quite shake off the condescension of the chaplain, yet he did not take possession of the prisoner\u0027s stool and leave him to stand. The consequence was that both kept their feet. \"To tell the truth, Gardiner, I\u0027ve come to say good-by. I shan\u0027t have another chance; I\u0027m off first thing to-morrow.\" \"Off on leave, sir?\" \"Off for good. I\u0027m leaving the prison. It\u0027s been in the air for some time, but it was only finally arranged last night. I\u0027ve said nothing about it, because I didn\u0027t want a fuss; but I could not leave without seeing you.\" \"Thanks,\" said Gardiner, smiling. \"You\u0027ll be missed. I\u0027m glad my time\u0027s nearly up. Are you going to another prison, or is it an ordinary parish job?\" \"Neither. I am joining up.\" \"Chaplain to the forces?\" \"Better than that. I enlist.\" Gardiner\u0027s face, in the first moment of surprise, was more expressive than he could have wished. Roche, with his odd touch of the theatrical, laid a hand on his shoulder. \"You envy me?\" he asked, his voice thrilling and deepening. \"Never mind, my poor fellow, your turn will come. Another month and you too will be free to do your bit with the best of us. In the service of your country there is no respect of persons—\" The hand was vigorously shaken off, and Gardiner stepped back. \"I\u0027ll be shot if I\u0027m going to let you patronize me! If you think that because you happen to be the Honorable and Reverend Dalrymple-Roche, and I\u0027m B14—Why, I[Pg 285] was round the world and back again before you were out of your schoolroom!\" He burst out laughing. \"Gardiner—\" \"No, no, wait a bit; let me finish what I\u0027ve got to say, now I\u0027ve begun. I\u0027ve had it on my mind for some time; I meant to save it up for when I got out, but as it seems I shan\u0027t have the chance then I\u0027ll do it now. You\u0027ve been very decent to me, and you\u0027ve kept me going through a rather beastly time, and I don\u0027t forget that, and I don\u0027t want to let it all lapse, and I rather think you don\u0027t either; but I won\u0027t be patronized. I may be in prison, but I\u0027ve done nothing I\u0027m ashamed of, and I do not consider myself disgraced. Got that?\" The words were not bluff, they were plain truth; very telling was his vigorous independence. \"Well, then, if I pay you deference here it\u0027s because discipline has to be maintained, and incidentally because I should get it hot if I didn\u0027t. For that reason, and for no other; certainly not because I feel deferential. Deferential! You wait till you\u0027ve cut your wisdom teeth, my son, before you start preaching to me. There; I\u0027ve done. You can report me if you like—sir.\" Roche had colored up; he looked very haughty and very angry. \"I think you forget yourself,\" he began, and then his mobile face changed. \"I beg your pardon, Gardiner; you are perfectly right. I have no business to patronize you. I don\u0027t mean to do it; but it\u0027s the more or less official manner, and one slips into it—to tell the truth, that\u0027s one reason why I want to get away.\" \"Oh, that\u0027s all right, lots of parsons have a turn for magniloquence,\" said Gardiner, with a laugh, \"and if you do it again I shall tell you again, that\u0027s all. You inevitably will. And so you mean to enlist? Ho ho!\" His smile broadened as he ran his eye over Roche\u0027s handsome figure. He did not say, \"You won\u0027t like that, my friend,\" but he thought it. \"The French priests take their places in the ranks,\" said Roche, \"why not we? I put that to my bishop. He refused to release me. One must act on one\u0027s own conscience[Pg 286] in these matters. I am a priest, it is my duty to lead men; when peace comes, how can I expect them to follow me, if during the war I have been skulking behind my cloth here in England? I would not follow such a man. If the clergy shirk now, they will be digging the Church\u0027s grave.\" \"Very sound sentiments. I have an old daddy, and if he were thirty years younger—thank goodness he isn\u0027t, for he\u0027d certainly get shot. Well, I congratulate you. Mind my finger, I\u0027m still rather frail.\" Roche had wrung his hand with more fervor than discretion. \"Funny beggar you are!\" Gardiner added, with the laugh in his eyes that was often there when he talked to Roche. \"You won\u0027t get shot. Bet you what you like you come out with the V.C.!\" \"Priests don\u0027t bet.\" \"Privates do, though. Not that you\u0027ll stay a private. You\u0027ll be offered a commission—\" \"I shan\u0027t accept it,\" Roche declared. \"More fool you, then, for you\u0027re just the sort they want. You lucky beggar—oh, you lucky beggar!\" The hunger of envy peeped out. Roche, at times self-absorbed and blind, had at other times an Irish quickness of perception. \"Gardiner—I\u0027m sorry! Perhaps after all, if a competent surgeon sees your hand, instead of that wretched little sawbones—\" \"Oh, that\u0027s all right, I shall get my whack by and by, even if I can\u0027t go into the trenches. Which reminds me: you won\u0027t forget to put through that little bit of business I asked you about, will you? (There\u0027s old Busy Bee locking up for the night, you\u0027ll have to clear out in two twos.) Just a word of introduction to Lord Ronayne, that\u0027s all I want. You see a criminal just out of jail does need some sort of sponsor.\" Gardiner\u0027s grin was quite free from bitterness. \"I won\u0027t forget,\" said Roche hurriedly, \"I hadn\u0027t forgotten. I can answer for my father. Good-by, Gardiner—God bless you!\" Again he wrung the prisoner\u0027s hand, and again left him[Pg 287] laughing and swearing and shaking his fingers—a characteristic farewell. Chim-chime. Chim-chime. Chim-chime. A quarter to five. St. Agnes\u0027 clock was striking as Roche came out into the lilac and gold of the October sunset, which lightened and broadened down the clean deserted streets, and glittered like tongues of fire in all the western windows. The trees in the square were brilliant, gold lace over iron filigree. Beyond them three tall chimneys stood, slender, black, and tapering against the cornflower-blue of distant hills. A train, just arrived in the station, was veiling itself in snowy mist, sun-smitten; and as Roche turned into the High Street St. Agnes\u0027 bells began to play The King of Love, merry and clear, a sweet little rocking tune in triplets. How bright the town was, and how peaceful in its Sunday rest! Not a soul was about, except the half-dozen travelers from the train; one of these, a tall man in the then unfamiliar uniform of the Royal Flying Corps, stopped to ask Roche the way to the prison. In B14\u0027s cell it was already night. There was no sunshine here, not even light enough for him to throw his shoe at the blackbeetle which had crawled up the hot-water pipes, and was running about on the concrete floor. Gardiner lay on his back, hands clasped behind his head, staring at the gray oblong of his window, and wondering how he was going to get through the thirteen hours of darkness. He was not laughing now. He would have given twenty pounds for a candle and a book to read, fifty for a cigarette—he might as well have offered to buy the moon. In the padded cell he had touched bottom; nothing could ever be so bad again as the days before that night, in their agony of impotence, or the night itself, in its agony of despair. Prison—it was a tedious business, no doubt, but what of that? He could only wonder why he had ever made a fuss about such a trifle. He had grappled with his bogy, and behold it turned out to be only a turnip-lantern ghost after all. Difficulties, once surmounted, have a way of[Pg 288] sinking back and effacing themselves in the past; absorbed in a greater trouble, Gardiner did not realize that he had at last fought and won the battle, long impending, which made him master of himself. He did believe, from the first he had never doubted, that Lettice was dead. Wandesforde\u0027s message, which he faithfully delivered in person, had not shaken that conviction. It had only made him feel that Denis was dead too. Yes, they were both gone; but Gardiner no longer held himself responsible. That dreadful crazy feeling of guilt, which his sanity, half insane, had used to save him from himself, had passed with the crisis it provoked. He had not killed her; yet she was dead, and he missed her more instead of less every day; every day he came upon fresh tracts of his mind marked broad with her mark, and saw with dismay the widening scope of his loss. But no one knew of it, and no one was going to know, through him. \"Not that anybody would be particularly interested,\" he reflected. \"My dear daddy—he would, bless his heart, but he\u0027ll never see, and I shall never tell him; he\u0027d get the shock of his life to think I was old enough to want to get married. Married! Oh, my Lord, I wish I had married her; I could have stood it better now if I\u0027d ever had one ounce of satisfaction.... And besides daddy, who else? Tom? Roche? I don\u0027t think!\" He laughed. \"Little Scott, then—he\u0027d be all agog, but he isn\u0027t going to have the chance, confound him! I wish old Denis were here. I could have talked to him. He would have understood. He knew me pretty well, did Denis, after all these years. I wonder how I\u0027m going to get on without him. \u0027Their soul was much discouraged because of the way.\u0027 Hard going: that\u0027s what I\u0027m to expect, I suppose, for the rest of my wanderings in this wilderness.... There was a lot of likeness between them at bottom. I expect that\u0027s why I feel as though I\u0027d known her all my life and before I was born—I did know her, in him. But he would always try to hide his dear old head in a bag whenever I did anything to upset his little feelings, and she never did. Not she! She\u0027d go picking her way with her little lamp round all your[Pg 289] dark corners, inexorably showing you every cobweb and every speck of dust that her highness didn\u0027t approve, and all without a word spoken, just by the poise of that darling little head of hers and those inimitable hazel eyes—hazel? No, b\u0027 Jove! What was it she used to say? \u0027Weak Bovril, with little bits of carrot floating about\u0027—oh, Lettice, Lettice! oh, why the devil did I let myself begin on this?\" He flung his arm across his eyes, as if he would have hidden his trouble even from himself. Blind instinct had first dragged him to Lettice, a straw in the current; he felt he needed her long before he knew he loved her. But love, and even passion, had come since, flooding in by back ways, filling him to the brim. He was tormented by his lost opportunities. \"When I had her to myself there in Rochehaut, why didn\u0027t I make her marry me? She\u0027d have done it if I\u0027d put the screw on; you can get pretty well anything out of Lettice if she\u0027s only sorry enough for you. Or here in prison, why couldn\u0027t I have put my arm round that little waist of hers and taken a kiss? What would she have done if I had? Would she have had the impertinence to ruffle up all her pretty feathers and make believe to be affronted? Or could I have got right down through all her defenses to the very heart of her, and made her drop her lashes, and color, and—acknowledge me? I\u0027d give my eyes to know, and I never shall, never. She had more reticences and reserves and evasions than any human being I have ever met. She was as delicate as the bloom on a butterfly. Angelita de mi corazón, I would have respected your little fads; you should have kept your fenced garden and your fountain sealed. I could have held your life in my hand and never closed my fingers on it—yes, I could; even that. I was your very true lover. I wonder, was it a bayonet—\" To this precipice Gardiner always came, sooner or later. We talk of unimaginable horrors; there were none he had not imagined. How do men live, with thoughts like these? God knows. \"B14, are ye waukin? Ye\u0027re to dress and come wi\u0027 me.\" \"Hullo! is that Mr. Mackenzie? What\u0027s up?\" [Pg 290] \"It\u0027s a veesitor for ye.\" \"A visitor at this time of night? Here\u0027s an exciting go! Who is it—an officer? Big man in the R.F.C.?\" Mackenzie shook his head. \"I canna tell ye, for I havena seen him.\" \"Now I wonder what good you think you are?\" said Gardiner, sitting up, laughing, blinking at the light. \"Rousing me out of my beauty sleep! Yes, I beg your pardon, sir, and all that, but I\u0027m coming out quite soon, you know. Hold the light, do you mind, and let me find my socks?\" He laughed in self-defense, and he asked questions for form\u0027s sake; but he knew all the time that this was his doom. Only an urgent messenger would have been admitted at this hour. It was Wandesforde, come to tell him how she had died. That thought went with him down the twilit passages, it stood sentinel before the yellow-glimmering door of the visitors\u0027 room. \"Ye\u0027ve half-an-hour,\" said Mackenzie in business-like tones as he turned the handle. Gardiner drew a long breath and walked through the specter into the room. A long-legged officer stood up. Wandesforde? No. Oh, good God! \"She\u0027s safe,\" said Denis instantly. \"Here, hold on, old man; it\u0027s all right!\" Gardiner was not all right; he was nearly fainting. By and by he found himself sitting in a chair, still gripping Denis with both hands, while Denis patted him gently on the back. \"She\u0027s all right,\" he kept repeating—wise Denis, to harp on the one thing that mattered. \"Quite all right; quite safe. Gently does it. Better now, are you?\" Yes, Gardiner was better and he said so with decision. Denis withdrew to the other side of the table and sat smiling at him. \"We got back last night. We\u0027ve been together all the time. Didn\u0027t Wandesforde tell you? I went first to the W.O. to report myself, and then straight on to get leave to see you. Even a Government department has bowels[Pg 291] these days. I wanted Lettice to come too, but she said she thought you\u0027d rather not, so she\u0027s gone down to her own people in Kent. Rather rough luck on them all this time, what? She sent her love.\" \"Go on,\" said Gardiner, leaning back and composing himself to listen. \"Begin at the beginning and go on to the end, then stop. Lord! I wish you\u0027d asked the bowelful Home Office to let me have a smoke while you were about it. Anda, caballerito! Let\u0027s have the \u0027ole of the \u0027orrible details.\" Denis launched into his tale. He began, as directed, with the raid on Aix, and his soft Irish tongue ran on fluently till he came to the Bellevue. \"I can\u0027t tell you what it was like to see it, Harry. It\u0027s one thing to read about these things, safe here in England; but to see it—a place you\u0027ve known—\" \"A place you own,\" said Gardiner grimly. \"Yes, that\u0027s what these beastly pacifists never seem to grasp. On a toujours assez de force—they\u0027d sing a different song if it was their own maux instead of those of autrui. Poor old Bellevue. Well, I\u0027ll build it up again. Go ahead. What happened next?\" \"Oh, well, of course I had to ask about it—them—I was a bit reckless, I suppose. I went down and hailed a man in the road. He told me they were safe at the Hasquins\u0027 farm. And so while we were talkin\u0027 of course a lot of beastly Boches came round the corner. I skipped like a young unicorn, I can tell you, but they potted me, and then they chased me all over the place. But I dodged \u0027em and got up into the fir wood. I wanted pretty badly to see for myself—\" Gardiner raised his eyebrows. \"Bit risky, what?\" \"Ah, but I never meant to show up. I was goin\u0027 to lie doggo and get off again after dark. It was Lettice spied me out—you know what her eyes are.\" Gardiner nodded. \"I do blame myself,\" said Denis earnestly. \"I\u0027ll never get over it; but I was bleedin\u0027 like a pig and a bit muzzy-headed. Well, there it was, anyway. I fainted, and they did what[Pg 292] they liked with me. They got me over and hid me in the tower. Remember the tower?\" Did Gardiner remember the tower? He remembered it so well, and saw Lettice beside it so vividly, that he fell silent, and let Denis tell the rest of his tale almost without question. They had stayed at the farm till Denis was fit to travel. Then, one wet evening, they set out to tramp across Belgium, he in Monsieur Hasquin\u0027s blouse and loose trousers, she in Madame\u0027s Sunday skirt. \"She didn\u0027t like it one bit,\" said Denis, with a reminiscent smile. \"Wanted to take her hair curlers in the bundle. Very annoyed with me because I wouldn\u0027t let her. It rankled for days.\" Denis in addition had his scarred face tied up to represent toothache. \"We did look rather scalawags,\" he admitted. They lay up by day and walked by night, keeping mostly to the fields, and guiding themselves by Denis\u0027s pocket compass. Once the café where they were at supper was invaded by soldiers, who luckily took no notice of their ragged companions. Another time when they were sheltering in a barn some Brandenburgers came in to search for fodder. They did not search behind the patent reaper in the corner. Yet again they went to sleep in a copse, and woke to find they had chosen the exercising ground of a squadron of cavalry. That was near the Dutch frontier. Next night they crossed under cover of darkness, and were safe. \"Well, I consider it all most compromising for Lettice, and if you\u0027d a spark of proper feeling you\u0027d offer to marry her,\" said Gardiner, yawning with his arms above his head, \"but of course you never think of that, selfish brute. Lord! I shall sleep like a pig to-night. Spoiled your beauty, Denis,\" he added, looking at the scar, red and puckered. Denis put up his hand to the place. \"That was our friend Fritz. He does sometimes score a bull\u0027s-eye.\" \"Well, it seriously detracts from your market value as a husband. On second thought, I\u0027m not sure but Lettice had better put up with me after all.\" He hesitated. A point that had not escaped him was Denis\u0027s significant change of[Pg 293] pronoun in the latter part of his narrative from \"they\" to \"she.\" What in the world had they done with Dorothea? Left her behind at the farm? Anything was possible with that dear lunatic! He had no thought of tragedy. There seemed no room for it in Denis\u0027s straightforward tale, and no hint of it in his quiet, smiling manner. \"I say, Denis, I\u0027ve no wish to be indiscreet, and I\u0027m not asking if I ought to hold my tongue—but Wandesforde said—\" \"Yes,\" said Denis, \"I was comin\u0027 to that. She died.\" \"Died!\" \"Instead of me. I\u0027d never have got off but for her. She put on my flying kit and led them away from the farm. She was always keen on dressin\u0027 up as a boy. Of course I\u0027d have stopped it if I\u0027d known, but I didn\u0027t; I was off my head. I can\u0027t tell you exactly what happened, but they shot her, and they hunted her, and finally they rounded her up in the fir wood. The officer in command was quite a decent boy, Lettice said; she\u0027d have been all right if she\u0027d given herself up. But that would have meant givin\u0027 me up, do you see, so she wouldn\u0027t do it. She crawled into one of those caves up there and refused to come out.\" \"Well?\" \"They bombed her,\" said Denis simply. \"Like clearin\u0027 a dug-out. So the whole place fell in. She must have counted on that. She knew it wasn\u0027t safe.\" \"That was pretty fine,\" said Gardiner under his breath. He could find nothing more. The contrast was too poignant. \"The one shall be taken\"—but Lettice was left. \"Yes,\" said Denis. \"I\u0027ve wondered, Harry: do you think there\u0027s anything in that Carth\u0027lic idea of prayers for the dead?\" Gardiner, with those expectant dark blue eyes fixed on him in their inveterate simplicity, found himself answering: \"Oh, I expect—\" \"Because, you see, we didn\u0027t have much time to say things,\" Denis explained. \"I\u0027m sorry, I didn\u0027t mean to bore you with this, but it\u0027s been rather a facer for me. You know, if she\u0027d lived, she\u0027d have been my wife.\" \"Oh, my dear old Denis—!\" said Gardiner. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3250/89071.html","bookId":604,"book":{"id":604,"title":"Convict B14","description":"简介： When men shall say, Peace, and all things are safe, then shall sudden destruction come upon them, as sorrow cometh upon a woman travailing with child, and they shall not escape....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3250","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:01 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:01 AM"}}
