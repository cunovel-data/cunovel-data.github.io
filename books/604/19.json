{"id":31493,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XIX DU PARTI DU GRAND AIR","content":"The thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.—Book of Job. Ten days later, after his examination before the Borough Bench at Westby, Gardiner was committed to the February Assizes on a charge of manslaughter. Bail not being allowed, he spent the intervening months in Westby Jail. Lettice, in common with the rest of the world who haven\u0027t been to prison, knew nothing of the rules and regulations applying to a prisoner on remand. She did know, however, that in English law a man is held to be innocent until he has been found guilty; and she took for granted that any one so detained would be treated in a liberal way, and allowed every possible privilege of the free man except freedom. Accordingly, she wrote to Gardiner at Westby, and, getting no reply, wrote again. This time an answer came through: My dear Miss Smith,—Your letters to me and mine to you are all read by the governor of this home of joy. In the circumstances I would rather do without. Yours very truly, H. C. Gardiner. Lettice did not love injustice. It made her blood boil. She was angrier than Gardiner himself. She understood the feeling which made him refuse her letters. It was not a mere cutting off his nose to spite his face; it was a real idiosyncrasy of taste, akin to that which spoiled for him the \"set piece\" loveliness of Frahan. What he disliked there was not the bodily presence of the tourists—he would have felt just the same under the midwinter moon—but the taint[Pg 162] left by their eyes, which spread a film of defilement over the whole lovely scene. Even so the Governor\u0027s eyes deflowered and defiled her letters. Absurd and fanciful, no doubt; but it was just those streaks of the fantastic that made him attractive to Lettice. She could not get him out of her head. What must it be for him, with his anchorite ways, to be under supervision, day and night, through the accursed little spy-hole in the door of his cell? Lettice knew all about that spy-hole now. Since receiving his letter she had read every book about prisons that the Museum could supply. Turning over, sifting, arranging her deductions, she had reached a fairly correct estimate of his state of mind. Denis she had not seen since they parted at Rochehaut. Using a sort of defensive frankness, he had told her by letter about Dorothea\u0027s sojourn at Bredon, which he could do quite naturally without touching on their personal relations. Lettice tried to read between the lines, but Denis in those months had traveled too far for her to follow, at least on paper. He had of course attended to give evidence before the Borough Bench; he had seen Gardiner then, and once since. \"I wish the confounded place weren\u0027t at the other end of the earth,\" he wrote. \"I can\u0027t possibly get up there again at present, it\u0027s not fair on Wandesforde; he wants the seaplane finished for the Olympia show, and it\u0027ll take me every minute of my time. Mr. Gardiner was up in November, but now I hear he\u0027s sick; and Tom, the brother, is stationed at Queenstown, so he\u0027s no good. Which means that Harry\u0027s seen no one for a month. I don\u0027t like it. It\u0027s too long. I\u0027m rather badly worried about him.\" And, as an afterthought, written across the top: \"Why don\u0027t you run down there yourself? I wish you would.\" That letter came to Lettice on a day of December fog, which had found its way into the Museum. Overhead in a smelly haze the arc lamps waxed and dwindled, milky moons, each with its pin-point core of white incandescence; and on all sides tremendous sneezes went resounding like minute guns round the dome. Any regular attendant of the[Pg 163] reading-room may become a connoisseur in sneezes. Lettice herself sneezed at times, a minute one-syllable explosion like a kitten\u0027s. She was always a slow worker, slow but accurate; to-day her pen moved more deliberately than ever. Then it stopped and she sat immobile, staring at nothing.... Explicit: she got up: within five minutes she had returned her books, retrieved her umbrella from the cloak-room, and was out in the street. She caught the midnight express from Euston, and reached Westby at eight the next morning. Visitors were not admitted to the prison until ten. Lettice spent her time of waiting in a church near by. When the hour struck she was at the gates, which were set, huge and gloomy, under an arch in the outer wall. No one else was waiting. Lettice tugged at the bell chain. A slip door in the carriage gate was opened by a porter, to whom she stated her errand. She was handed over to a warder, who led her across a court laid out in grass and flower-beds to the second gate, in a wall thirty feet high. Beyond this was a vestibule closed by an iron grille—the third gate; beyond, again, the central hall of the prison. Wards radiated from it in all directions like the spokes of a wheel; each a long rectangle lined with cells, tier above tier, regular as a honeycomb, all the way up to the roof. Across the central well a light iron staircase zigzagged from story to story. The walls were gray, the woodwork tan-brown, the floor of concrete: all was clean, commonplace, tragic. At each landing a stout wire-netting inclosed the staircase. Lettice\u0027s guide pointed it out. \"See that, miss? That\u0027s to prevent \u0027em throwing themselves over. They will do it, if you give \u0027em the chance. We\u0027d a man here last year as threw himself down from that top landing up there. Cracked his skull he did, and cracked the paving-stone too, that\u0027s more! He was in hospital for a bit, but he got over it, and took his discharge; and if you\u0027ll believe me, miss, six months after we\u0027d got him back for something else.\" The remand cells were not in this part of the prison. Lettice was taken to a waiting-room to get the necessary[Pg 164] permit, and then led on through many corridors. She caught glimpses of cells as she passed, and saw prisoners, in their ugly drab uniforms, sweeping and scrubbing the floors. They stared at her with avid, furtive curiosity which made her feel half ashamed of her freedom. She saw Gardiner in those debased figures, cringing out of the way at the officer\u0027s curt word of command. \"Here you are, miss!\" said he at last, briskly unlocking one of those innumerable doors: and Lettice passed in. She saw a cell like any of the others and a figure sitting under the window reading. The book went down on the floor, anyhow and anywhere, as he started to his feet. \"Lettice!\" Till that moment Lettice had been doubtful of her mission; after it she doubted no more. She stood, letting him hold her hands; she did not speak; she could not have found words, if she had tried, for the contraction of her throat. Gardiner was clutching her like a drowning man. Dim shades of feeling passed across his face, like wind over a corn-field. He was yellow as a lemon and bony as a castaway, but the worst was to see him so near to losing control. For a moment Lettice was afraid he would break down altogether. But with a mighty effort he pulled round, released her hands and began to talk almost in a natural way. \"Well, this is most fearfully noble of you! How in the world did you find your way here? You surely didn\u0027t come up on purpose?\" \"I thought I would like to see what a prison is like,\" explained Lettice in her delicate, deliberate way. She sat down on the chair he offered and looked round his domain. Gardiner rented a \"private room\" about eight feet square, lighted by a strip of ground glass, which was set immediately under the ceiling, well out of reach. An iron spring bedstead was reared against the wall. The mattress and striped blanket, neatly buttoned into a roll, were stowed under a bracket in the corner. This bracket held books; a second, in the corresponding corner opposite, had a tin mug and plate. The jug and basin, also of tin, stood on the floor.[Pg 165] Lettice had the only chair, and Gardiner might sit on his thumbs. There was no other furniture. \"I haven\u0027t seen a soul for months,\" he said, contemplating her with admiring gratitude. \"Denis has been inseparably wedded to that darned aeroplane of his, and my daddy\u0027s in bed, bless his heart. You don\u0027t know how one gets to pine after somebody from outside. It\u0027s a piece of luck, too, having it to ourselves like this. I had to interview Denis in the visitors\u0027 room, under the eye of a warder. But when my daddy came to see me he raked up such an appalling amount of dust that ever since, as a special concession, I\u0027ve been allowed to see visitors here. My daddy is rather talented at raking up a dust. I can do it, too, but not so tactfully as he does. The Governor simply loves daddy, but with me he\u0027s at daggers drawn. Are you looking at my choice of literature? Tom keeps me supplied, but it\u0027s no good sending anything but sixpennies, because I have to leave \u0027em all behind when I go, for the benefit of the prison library. Vingt Ans Après—jolly tale, isn\u0027t it? I always have agreed with Rochefort—je ne suis que d\u0027un parti, c\u0027est du parti du grand air!\" Lettice put down the book—quite quickly. \"And what do you do all day?\" she asked. \"What do I do? Would you like a time-table? I get up about five, have breakfast, then tidy my room. Chapel\u0027s at seven; visitors between ten and twelve; exercise between eleven and twelve, if it\u0027s fine—if it\u0027s wet I don\u0027t get any. That\u0027s about the worst part of this place. I told the Governor one day it would do me less harm to get soaked outside than to dry-rot in here, but he wouldn\u0027t see it. A rule is a rule. Silly business, what?\" \"But what do you do? Don\u0027t you go out to work?\" He shook his head, laughing. \"I\u0027m still innocent. I don\u0027t mix with the convicted prisoners. I should be allowed to work at my own trade in my cell, if they had the necessary tools; but I\u0027m afraid they\u0027re not likely to import a hotel to be run. I\u0027ve sewn mail-bags from time to time, when I got very bored.\" [Pg 166] \"Then do you mean to say you\u0027re in this, this, this—this horrid little hole of a place the whole day long when it\u0027s raining, and all except one hour when it isn\u0027t?\" He laughed again. \"Lettice, what a first-class rebel you\u0027d make! I never knew any one sit down more uncomfortably under what you think injustice than you do!\" To that Lettice said nothing; she never would talk about herself. \"And does nobody come to see you?\" she asked. \"To be sure they do. The chaplain\u0027s perseveringly chatty; he\u0027s another who fell a victim to my daddy. The doctor\u0027s been once—and that was really rather funny. You know, by a most odd coincidence, he was actually at the Easedale at the time of the row—was called to view the body and gave evidence at the inquest. Of course it\u0027s not etiquette for him to remember that now, and you may bet he doesn\u0027t! Only we look at each other with what you might call an eye. I\u0027m not his regular patient yet, but I shall be when I\u0027m convicted.\" \"You think you will be convicted?\" \"Sure of it. So is my lawyer; I made him practically own it last time he was here. He wouldn\u0027t say how long I shall get, though—I suppose it\u0027s impossible to forecast. Three days, or three months, or three years, either\u0027s on the cards. It\u0027s a thoroughly sentimental case, and I\u0027ve no doubt Mrs. Trent will appeal strongly to the sensibilities of the jury. But the law isn\u0027t sentimental, praise the pigs!\" \"I wish you would tell me exactly what happened at Grasmere.\" \"Why, I did, didn\u0027t I? Trent came down spoiling for a fight, and I set out to tame his savage breast. I soon had him drinking out of my hand, and then he began to be confidential. I stood it as long as I could, Denis simmering like a kettle in the background, and then I up and shied the first thing that came to hand at his head. You read the report of the inquest, didn\u0027t you? It was all there, bar that last exchange of courtesies. I believe I called him a filthy swine.\" \"Why?\" [Pg 167] \"Because he was one, to be sure.\" \"What had he been saying?\" \"Really, do you think that\u0027s a nice question for a young lady?\" \"I was only thinking it might have been something inexcusably bad.\" \"How do you mean?\" \"If he had been talking about Mrs. Trent.\" She took Gardiner\u0027s breath away. \"Well, you certainly have an imagination!\" he said. \"Don\u0027t go making suggestions of that kind to any one else, I beg!\" \"It would have meant your getting off.\" \"It would have been the deuce and all for Mrs. Trent.\" To that again Lettice answered nothing, but her under lip hardened slightly. She glanced at her watch. Five minutes more. Looking up, she met Gardiner\u0027s eyes fixed on her in urgent and unmistakable appeal. For a moment Lettice quailed. She saw something very big, very grave approaching, and she wanted ignominiously to run away. In all her generous giving there was always a reserve, a barrier of privacy, the fenced garden and the fountain sealed where she walked alone. But if he wanted to come in there for sanctuary—well, he must, it was no good, she could not deny him: this was not the time to think of herself. \"Lettice,\" he began—and for the first time she noticed his use of her name—\"Lettice, there\u0027s one thing I want to tell you. You think I was caught red-handed in the act of bolting. It wasn\u0027t so. I had made up my mind to go back and give myself up. I was just off to do it when they arrested me. And I want you to know that it was all you—what you had said in town. I couldn\u0027t go on with it after that.\" \"I\u0027m glad,\" said Lettice. \"I\u0027m glad too,\" said Gardiner, his voice shaking, \"partly, at any rate. I should be altogether glad if I were sure about the future.\" \"The future?\" \"If I\u0027m convicted. If I get a long sentence. If I have[Pg 168] to stand much more of this—Lettice! I can\u0027t humbug you. I\u0027ve told Denis a stack of lies as high as a house, of which he may or may not believe one-third. I can\u0027t let him see the truth, because it\u0027s his evidence that\u0027s going to convict me. He has enough on his shoulders without that, poor old chap. But you—I don\u0027t care how much you know. And I want your help. I\u0027m afraid.\" She looked at him, questioning. \"I\u0027m afraid,\" he repeated under his breath, lower than a whisper. The perspiration started on his forehead. \"I\u0027m not like Denis, you know. He\u0027s A1 quality, sound all through—if he wanted to go wrong I believe he wouldn\u0027t know the way! But I\u0027m different. I\u0027m second-rate. I ought not to be, being the son of my daddy, but I haven\u0027t kept up to his standard. He doesn\u0027t see it, bless his heart; but you do, and Denis does, though he tries to blind his eyes, and even Tom—in his heart of hearts he can\u0027t help feeling that his brother is a bit of a bounder. Oh yes, I always know when I grate on people. I see my own shortcomings plainer than any of you. I\u0027m second-rate in manners, and in morals, and in essential stuff.\" He looked straight at her, and though Lettice could have contradicted him, she did not; for she saw what he meant, and was not afraid to admit to herself that there was a measure of truth in his self-condemnation. \"Thanks,\" said Gardiner, with a fleeting smile, bending his head in acknowledgment of her honesty. \"That\u0027s me, and I never forget it. I wanted to put you wise before I went on to what I have to say. I can just stand this now because it\u0027s not final. I still hope to get out in February, though I may swear I don\u0027t. I daren\u0027t leave off hoping it. I\u0027m holding on to that. But if—if it isn\u0027t—If I get a long sentence—years, perhaps—I\u0027m afraid, Lettice. I—I—I\u0027m afraid of myself.... So may I hold on to you? May I tell myself that I can come to you when it\u0027s over?\" \"Yes,\" said Lettice. Against the drag of his urgent need she stood like a rock in flood-time. It was not merely love that drew them [Pg 169]together; for lovers, even devoted lovers, may part without injury to their characters; sometimes, indeed, to their own ultimate gain. But these two could not have parted without grave loss and damage, especially to Gardiner. Yes, and to Lettice also; for he called out faculties which but for him would have slept for ever in comfortable laziness. Instinct drove them together, as two drops of water are driven to coalesce. He had her hands again in a desperate clutch; for a moment he rested his forehead on them. \"Time\u0027s up, miss,\" said the warder at the door. Lettice freed herself without haste or embarrassment. \"Till February, then,\" said she. \"You\u0027re surely not coming up to the trial?\" \"Of course I am,\" said Lettice. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3250/89057.html","bookId":604,"book":{"id":604,"title":"Convict B14","description":"简介： When men shall say, Peace, and all things are safe, then shall sudden destruction come upon them, as sorrow cometh upon a woman travailing with child, and they shall not escape....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3250","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:01 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:01 AM"}}
