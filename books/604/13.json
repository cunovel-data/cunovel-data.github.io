{"id":31487,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XIII ONE NAIL DRIVES OUT ANOTHER","content":"I looked and saw your heart In the shadow of your eyes, As the seeker sees the gold In the shadow of the stream. Three Shadows. There is a legend which says that September is the month of the fading leaf. Townsmen may fancy so, looking at their own starved avenues, which begin to shrivel and strip themselves as early as July; but in the country the massive woods (except that an elm here and there hangs out a single crocus-yellow spray) keep the somber green of late summer to the very end of the month. Then, as the days pass, first the lime \"strips to the cold and standeth naked above her yellow attire.\" The horse-chestnuts on some night of frost let drop all their fans in a rustling heap. The woodland paths are crisp with fawn-colored oak leaves. Last of all, in mid-November, the elms loosen to the wind and the rain those faint clouds of green and greenish-gold which have rounded the shape of their limbs, till all the wet meadows are strewn with them; and it is winter. At Rochehaut it was September still, late September. Gardiner, at leisure after the summer rush, had been to his bank at Bouillon, and, instead of returning by the vicinal, had chosen to walk back over the hills through Botassart. This route brought him past the crucifix. He had not been there since the grand explosion, and it cost him an effort to go back; but he refused to be sentimental, or allow a beautiful thing to be spoiled for him by fancies. There he lay then on the grass, smoking and dreaming. It seemed long, long since that summer night; so long[Pg 114] that he could look back now, on it and on Dorothea, as part of the past. Heavens! how she had hurt him! There was that time as a boy, when he tumbled waist-deep into a vat of scalding liquid at some chemical works; he could compare his feelings only to that violent assault of pain. Yes, she had hurt him abominably; the pain of his crushed hand had been by contrast a relief and a distraction. But the wound was on the surface; and, though he scarcely knew it himself, already it was beginning to heal. There was no poison in it. His passion for Dorothea had been effectually cauterized; he thought of her now without either resentment or desire. He was profoundly sorry; sorrier for Dorothea O\u0027Connor than even for Mrs. Trent. This pity, oddly enough, confirmed him in impenitence. \"I did her a good turn when I cleared that fellow out of her road,\" he said to himself with inverted satisfaction. \"If he\u0027d lived long enough for her to find him out, there\u0027d have been la de Dios es Cristo!\" Three days of pale still sunshine had closed in threatening gloom. The grassy hill of the crucifix was burnt putty-color; the hill of forests opposite was olive-somber; the valley fumed with tawny vapors, breathing down from the gloom of the sky, and up from the dark current of the river. All was still, grave, overcast, till the sun found his sunset crevice in the clouds and split them, overflowing in long lines of liquid gold between iron-heavy bars. Splendid transparent fan-rays of light and dark alternate streamed up the sky; they rimmed vague forms of mist with burning wire, they filled the empty blue with bronze and golden vapors; the whole vault of heaven was on fire, the wet brown hills flamed back responsive glory. Gardiner, susceptible to every earth influence, found his senses flooded with that golden exhilaration. Vague mists of thought took shape in its light; he knew now that that name on the lintel of the farm was not a mere coincidence. When he first saw the Bellevue, \"Why, I\u0027ve been here before,\" he had said to himself, with a thrill of startled recognition. And now, \"I belong here,\" he added, half aloud,[Pg 115] with a touch of solemnity, as though the spoken word must be irrevocable. Old ties were dear; but he knew in his heart, his body knew, that the wild Semois down there in the valley was more to him than the Darenth of his boyhood. This was his home. Bringing his dazzled eyes to earth, he saw that a figure had detached itself from the orchards of the Bellevue, and was slowly mounting the hill. One person only would climb like that, with so many divagations to avoid steep places, and so many halts to admire the view—or could it be to get her breath? It was Lettice. Since his accident, now five weeks ago, Gardiner had seen a good deal of Miss Smith. His hand had been unexpectedly troublesome; indeed he was only now beginning to use it. Meantime he had made use of Lettice as his amanuensis, repaying her services by refusing to allow her to settle her bill. \"No, I am not going to take that money,\" he said, energetically nodding towards the pile of notes she had deposited on his table. \"I\u0027ll pitch it into the fire if you leave it there. Also I shall wire to town for a regular secretary. Pick it up and take it away.\" Lettice did not like it in the very least; but very slowly and very stubbornly she did pick the money up and return it to her purse. Nor was her temper soothed when Gardiner looked at her direct, with a glint in his eye, and added, \"I know you wind Denis round your little finger, but I am not Denis. Two can play at being obstinate, savez-vous?\" Still, she continued to act as his secretary; until by the end of the month she knew his methods and his business almost as well as he did himself. It was after this episode that she began to play with him, admitting him to rank as an intimate; and that he began to discover what it was that Denis loved in those velvet touches. But he was more uncertain than Denis—he was not to be run by formula; he would turn unexpectedly, and parry, and strike back. Once or twice, too, especially at first, when he was acting the urbane and cheerful host, he found her eyes fixed upon him. They were instantly [Pg 116]withdrawn; but he knew she knew he was suffering, and oddly enough he did not resent it. Oddly, be it understood, because Gardiner was by no means fond of sympathy. His instinct when hard hit was to cover up the wound and keep it hidden from the world, and especially from his friends. Yet it seemed he did not mind Lettice. And now, though he saw she was making for the crucifix, to disturb his regal solitude, he did not stir. She had not seen him. She plodded on without looking up, and presently was hidden in a fold of the hill. When she emerged again, it was within ten yards of the crucifix and that lazy, smiling figure. She stopped short; one could almost hear her spirit say \"Oh!\" though her lips were silent. Her first impulse obviously was to beat a retreat (Gardiner chuckled, he had known it would be!), but she thought better of it, and came on. After surveying the heap of stones, she chose the one comfortable place, settled herself, and got out the inevitable green tablecloth. Lettice made great play with that tablecloth. Since she would not speak, Gardiner did. \"I didn\u0027t know you\u0027d found your way up here.\" \"Why, you told me about it yourself.\" \"Do you like it better than your wood pile in the forest?\" Lettice paused in the act of threading her needle to look round on the brown and gold of hills and woods and sky. \"Yes,\" said she; and if she had raved for an hour she could have expressed no more. Comfortable silence fell between them. Lettice stitched, and Gardiner smoked, and in the west the sunset flared in citron, amber, saffron, bronze, and a thousand shades of glory. In the east a scroll of cloud reared dazzling sunny heights of snow against dazzling blue. Lettice\u0027s needle slackened; it came to a standstill. \"Penny for your thoughts,\" said Gardiner. \"I haven\u0027t any.\" \"I thought you were composing a poem.\" Insults of insults! Lettice looked volumes of reproach. \"I was not,\" said she. \"But you do write poetry.\" [Pg 117] \"Who told you so?\" \"Who do you suppose? Denis has told me quite a lot about you. Hasn\u0027t he told you a lot about me?\" \"Yes; but it wasn\u0027t all of it true.\" Gardiner burst out laughing. \"Well, that is good! How do you know?\" \"Oh, it\u0027s, it\u0027s—it\u0027s obvious,\" said Lettice, with an exasperated wave of the hand to help out her meaning. She began to sew very fast. Gardiner contemplated her with a broad smile; but presently it faded, and he turned over and lay plucking at the grass. \"Did Miss O\u0027Connor leave her address with you?\" Lettice shook her head. \"She went off in such a hurry!\" Gardiner opened his mouth to speak, and checked himself for a garrulous fool. He did not know why he had mentioned Dorothea at all. A moment later the impulse came again, and he found himself, to his surprise, telling Lettice the very thing he had decided not to mention. \"Rather a queer thing about that young lady,\" he remarked lightly. \"I found out—to be exact, she hurled the fact in my teeth—that she wasn\u0027t a Miss, and that O\u0027Connor wasn\u0027t her name. She was a widow—a Mrs. Trent.\" \"Mrs. Trent? What, the, the—\" \"Oh, you know about her, do you? Yes, the Mrs. Trent of Easedale. She\u0027s firmly persuaded that I killed her husband. I believe she came over here simply and solely in order to worm some sort of confession out of me.\" He stopped, amazed at himself. Then he looked at Lettice. If deep unaffected interest can pull confidences out of a man, here was his excuse. Why, she was all eyes and ears! \"So that was it!\" she said. \"That was who she was!\" \"You don\u0027t mean to tell me you knew about this before?\" \"No, no, not her name. But I knew she didn\u0027t much like you.\" \"The dickens you did! Did she say so?\" \"No, I, I—I sort of gathered it.\" [Pg 118] \"I begin to think what Denis said about you was true,\" Gardiner remarked after a pause. \"What did Denis say about me?\" \"That you could see through a flight of stairs and a deal door.\" \"I don\u0027t know what you mean.\" \"You wouldn\u0027t, it\u0027s out of Dickens,\" said Gardiner, with a laugh which hid considerable perturbation. So she had guessed that, had she, before he knew it himself? What was there she did not guess? He began to feel helplessly transparent. Yet again he was surprised to find he did not hate her for intruding. Lettice could pick her way among sensibilities like a cat among china, and she neither misunderstood nor misjudged. There were episodes in his life which he would have been ashamed to show to Denis. He could have shown them every one to Lettice, unmarried girl though she was, and with no experience of the rough and tumble of life. Somehow one never thought of Lettice as a girl. He looked up at her. She had dropped her work and sat motionless, her eyes fixed on the sunset. In nature as in human nature, Lettice looked to the limit of sight, and beyond, to the city of God. It was that distant view which gave her the perspective for things near. While Gardiner was making these reflections, she turned her head suddenly and surprised him with a question: \"Does Denis know about Mrs. Trent?\" \"I should say not. I haven\u0027t told him.\" \"I think you\u0027d better.\" It was so unlike Lettice to offer advice that he stared in surprise. \"Why?\" \"He ought to know.\" \"I don\u0027t want to go into that business again,\" said Gardiner. \"He did hate it all so desperately—no, I don\u0027t want to rake it up again. Nor do I see any necessity. What does it matter?\" \"Would you mind if I told him?\" \"Why the dickens are you so keen?\" [Pg 119] She hesitated. She found it chronically hard to put her thoughts into speech, and in this case there were reservations to be made. Gardiner took the words out of her mouth. \"You don\u0027t mean you think she\u0027d go for him too?\" Lettice nodded. \"She meant to get a confession out of one or the other of you.\" \"Oh, my Lord!\" said Gardiner, and caught himself up. \"But if there\u0027s nothing to confess?\" A flash went over Lettice\u0027s face. Was it conceivable that she had guessed even that last thing? No, it wasn\u0027t, Gardiner decided hastily, that was beyond her, she couldn\u0027t possibly know. For an instant he thought of telling her himself, but caution, habit, above all self-derision held him back. He blurt out that damaging truth to a chance acquaintance? He wasn\u0027t such a fool!—All this passed through his mind in the instant between his question and her reply. \"Well, she didn\u0027t give you much of a time while she was trying to find out, did she?\" \"No; but—oh, she couldn\u0027t try that game on again, it would be too beastly low down, with a man like Denis! Besides, he isn\u0027t taking any, he simply hates women.... Look here, tell me exactly what you know, do you mind? What makes you so certain she meant to go for him?\" Lettice drew a long breath. Her explanation, when it came, ran clear and straight. Indeed, her thought was always lucid; it was the words that failed. \"It was that last day before she went. She began by telling me about herself and how unhappy she had been; and then she let out that there was some man she hated; and then she began asking questions about you and Denis, coupling you together, do you see?—but so that you couldn\u0027t help guessing it was you she\u0027d been talking about. One thing she asked was whether Denis would tell a lie to save a friend. And then Denis himself came up, and they talked flying; and she said she should go to Bredon some day and see the aeroplanes.\" \"You think she really meant business?\" [Pg 120] \"Yes, I do.\" \"Pleasant,\" said Gardiner, tugging at his mustache, with a sort of hard restraint. \"If she exploits Denis as she did me, he\u0027ll enjoy himself. Yes, I shall be very much obliged if you\u0027ll write to him. He\u0027ll take it better from you than from me.\" \"I wish I\u0027d known before,\" said Lettice, folding up her work. \"Oh, it\u0027s all right so far, she hasn\u0027t turned up at Bredon yet. I heard from Denis this morning.\" \"Yes, but don\u0027t you see if she did go she\u0027d be sure to tell him not to tell you?\" He did see, and felt sick. It cost him an effort to lie still. But he pulled himself together; that last secret, at least, she should not read. What to say, then? He would not confess, but equally he would not lie to her. He found something which was neither lie, confession, nor equivocation, but a piece of plain fact. \"If she ever does get hold of the truth about Trent, she\u0027ll be uncommonly sorry she tried to find out.\" Then he discovered that Lettice was neither looking at nor thinking of him. \"I hope she won\u0027t get it out of Denis,\" she said. \"I hope you\u0027ll be in time to prevent that.\" The words were mild; the spirit, not so. Gardiner was shamed out of his self-absorption. He saw Lettice\u0027s love for her cousin, roused in his defense; and he saw, too, with her, Denis tricked into betraying his friend. Why, he would never forgive himself! \"My Lord, yes!\" he said with unexpected gravity. \"That would be a worse business than anything she\u0027s done or could do to me.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3250/89051.html","bookId":604,"book":{"id":604,"title":"Convict B14","description":"简介： When men shall say, Peace, and all things are safe, then shall sudden destruction come upon them, as sorrow cometh upon a woman travailing with child, and they shall not escape....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3250","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:01 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:01 AM"}}
