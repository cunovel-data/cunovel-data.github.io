{"id":31492,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII WHEN THE HEART SUFFERS A BLOW","content":"What says the body when they spring Some monster torture-engine\u0027s whole Strength on it? No more says the soul. Count Gismond. Flying is no sport for the sluggard. The calmest hours of the twenty-four are often those before the dawn, and the earnest aviator must be ready to turn out of his warm bed at six, five, four, even three o\u0027clock in the morning, whether in the pleasant summer, or in the correspondingly unpleasant winter. He may then have to spend long hours at the \u0027drome waiting for the fog to lift, or the rain to clear, or the wind to drop; and in the end, as like as not, he may have to go home, wet, chilly, and sleepy, without having flown a yard. Decidedly not the sport for a sluggard. Six A.M. in mid-October, and bitterly cold. There was a gray sky, ripple on ripple of quilted cloud with never a gleam, and a small icy wind that blew persistently from the north. The coarse bice-green of the marshes was all discolored; the sedge, biscuit-pale, was clotted with mud from the September floods; the brimming dikes were ruled by the wind into long ripples, hard and black against the dawn. The dawn itself, how wan and threatening! Denis, surveying the signs of the sky as he unlocked the hangar, exerted himself to remark to Simpson that it looked like rain. Simpson, expert mechanic and latter-day Grimaud, assented with his civil grunt. His uncivil grunt he did not use on Denis, who had once been his officer. Like every worker who spins his stuff out of his own brain, Denis at times \"went stale.\" For the past ten days the flying boat had been laid aside, and he had been tinkering[Pg 154] at the monoplane by way of relaxation. Never losing sight of the function for which she had been built, that of a small fast scout in the war which he expected, he was always adding small improvements. Thus, after his experience in the Birmingham race, he had fitted her with self-starting gear, which enabled the pilot to get away at will, independent of outside help. Now he was working at a brake. Landing is still one of the chief dangers in cross-country flying, especially in England, where fields are small, and there is often a web of overhead wires. At that time (1913) there were not a dozen aerodromes in the kingdom, and not one a?roplane in ten had a brake of any sort. Theoretically, Denis\u0027s new design was all it should be; practically, of course, it might upset the machine and kill the pilot. Not that Denis ever believed he would be killed. \"The airman hath said in his heart, Tush, I shall never be cast down, there shall no harm happen unto me.\" He believed other people might be killed, however, and for this reason had severely snubbed Simpson when he offered to take on the trials. Simpson, faithful dog, bore no resentment. He had been watching the events of the past few weeks, and had come to the conclusion that \u0027e (in Simpson\u0027s mind Denis was always \u0027e) wasn\u0027t to say accountable just now. \"You\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 thought \u0027e might \u0027a\u0027 took warning by Muster Wandesforde,\" he reflected. \"\u0027E\u0027s a nice gent spoiled by the women, if ever there was one. But no. Jane! JANE! \u0027Ave you got that stooed steak on yet? You ain\u0027t? Then it\u0027ll be as tough as your shoe again. \u0027E ain\u0027t complained? \u0027E lef\u0027 the lot at the side of \u0027is plate last time, and if that ain\u0027t complainin\u0027 I dono what is. Now you get it on at once and let\u0027s hear no more chat. Seems to me you ain\u0027t good for anything, \u0027cep that bein\u0027 so deaf you can\u0027t gossip. Women,\" added Simpson, knocking out his pipe against his boot, \"they\u0027re the devil!\" After some preliminary \"taxi-ing\" on the ground, Denis rose, circling over the marshes. The country was asleep; pillars of smoke rose from cottage chimneys, but not a soul was abroad except the milkman, with his rattling silver cans,[Pg 155] and a solitary cyclist, spinning down the road towards Dent-de-lion. The cyclist waved a greeting; the blasé milkman did not so much as glance up. Denis sailed over them, over the roof of his house, turned into the wind, \"flattened out\" (i.e. brought level the nose of his machine, which had been gliding down a slant) and grounded on the turf without a jar. The brake acted perfectly. Simpson ran up, almost enthusiastic. He and Denis stood together talking shop (which was the sum of Simpson\u0027s talk) with zeal (Simpson supplying the zeal). \"Hi!\" Denis turned, screwing up his short-sighted eyes. At sight of the approaching figure his jaw dropped; he spoke one curt imperious sentence over his shoulder to Simpson, seized the new-comer\u0027s arm, dragged him back to the house, thrust him into the parlor and locked the door upon him, all without a word. Gardiner was left gasping. Here was a reception! But in a minute Denis was back, pushing open the door with a tray of breakfast crockery and the inevitable sausages. He deposited his burden on the table, which was already laid, and turned to lock the door again. \"What on earth possessed you to come here? I\u0027ve shut up Simpson, and he\u0027ll hold his tongue, but I\u0027d not answer for Miss Simpson, if she saw you. You must be mad!\" \"Mad?—to come here? I\u0027m not running from the police, my good Denis; did you think I was?\" \"I understood your brother to say—\" \"Oh, you\u0027ve heard from Tom, have you?\" Gardiner\u0027s tone was a shade less confident. \"Yes, I admit I did do a bunk from Woodlands; they took me by surprise, and I wasn\u0027t ready for \u0027em; I had two-three things to finish off—among others, I wanted a word with you. Which is why I\u0027m here. But as soon as I\u0027ve swallowed the sausage which I trust you\u0027re going to offer me I\u0027m off to Margate to surrender to the minions of the law.\" \"I thought you couldn\u0027t stand prison,\" said Denis. \"I thought it was the one risk you weren\u0027t prepared to face. However, it\u0027s no business of mine. If you can face it, I[Pg 156] certainly think you\u0027re wise to. Mustard? Oh, I forgot, you don\u0027t take it, do you?\" He poured out a cup of Miss Simpson\u0027s rich, muddy coffee for Gardiner and another for himself, but he did not drink; he went to the window and stood looking down the road. Gardiner, who was famished, drew up his chair; but his eyes kept straying to that silent figure. There was something in the wind that he did not like. Denis was utterly unlike himself, unlike any self his friend had ever had a glimpse of. He was so unapproachable that Gardiner knew not how to broach the errand that had brought him there. Presently, however, he turned to attend to Geraldine, who was winding round his boots and opening her little pink mouth in soundless mews of ecstasy. As he rose from putting down the saucer, he caught Gardiner\u0027s eye, and smiled faintly. \"Sorry, Harry. \u0027Fraid I\u0027ve rather let you down over this business. Anybiddy else would have made a better hand at it. But I\u0027m not much good at dissembling, and tell a lie I cann\u0027t—any babe could see through it. Else I\u0027d have done my best.\" \"My dear chap, I don\u0027t want you to tell lies for me!\" said Gardiner hastily. He was more than surprised; he was appalled. \"In point of fact, I\u0027m not sorry it has come out. I\u0027ve had no peace of my life these last two months, with Mrs. Trent going about like an unexploded bomb. I knew she\u0027d never rest till she harried me into the dock.\" He perceived, as he spoke, a certain change in the atmosphere. Denis had been sufficiently far away before; now he seemed to recede to the North Pole. There was a snapshot of Dorothea in her flying kit on the mantelpiece. Was this the explanation? Surely not! Surely she was the last woman in the world to attract a man like Denis! Gardiner, be it remembered, had never met that eager child who had learned to fly. \"It\u0027s about her I want to speak to you,\" he broke the ice determinedly. \"Here\u0027s the point. Do you, or do you not, remember what Trent said in that last speech of his, just before I let fly at him?\" [Pg 157] \"I\u0027m hardly likely to forget it.\" \"No, no, not the sense, the words; the actual phrasing he used. Do you remember that?\" He took a moment to think. \"Perhaps not. No, not to swear to.\" \"Good! Then it\u0027s all plain sailing. Tell everything that happened up till then; be as discursive as you please about my share in the business; but say, and swear, and stick to it that you can\u0027t remember that last speech, and at any price don\u0027t let it be dragged out of you.\" \"Very well.\" \"At any price, you understand?\" \"At any price?\" \"Yes; absolutely without reserve, at any price.\" \"I understand.\" \"That\u0027s off my mind, then,\" said Gardiner with a breath of relief. \"I had to see you, to make sure we should both be in the same tale. Now I\u0027ll be off to Margate while the iron\u0027s hot.\" \"Wait a moment,\" said Denis, detaining him. \"Before you go into this quixotic business I think you ought to see what it means. Of course I know you\u0027ve been making light of it to spare my feelings, but I don\u0027t believe you yourself realize what it is you\u0027re up against. It\u0027s serious. I\u0027m afraid they\u0027re going to make it a perjury charge. I had the police up here for hours yesterday—they wanted to run me in too—\" \"You? Oh, my God, Denis! They\u0027re not going to do that?\" \"No, I don\u0027t think so. What\u0027s the matter with you?\" \"I never dreamed of that,\" said Gardiner, holding his head in his hands. \"I swear I never dreamed there was the remotest possibility of that! To drag you, of all men, into this filthy mess—\" He dropped his hands and looked up, speaking fast and free: \"Of course you\u0027re right. I have been humbugging. I know I\u0027m in for a stiff sentence. I\u0027d never thought of perjury as a possible charge. But I give you my word, Denis, if I\u0027d ever had the faintest idea there[Pg 158] was the faintest risk of involving you, I\u0027d have—I\u0027d have blown my brains out first. Oh, Lettice was right; it is a fatal thing to be a coward.\" \"Lettice?\" \"I went to her on my way. Yes, I did mean to bolt in the first instance; I\u0027ve got my rig-out strapped on my bike at this instant. It was she stopped me. She does know how to sting up your conscience! But they can\u0027t really drag you in, Denis, can they? You never did actually say one syllable beyond the truth. Did you make them see that?\" \"I think so,\" said Denis. \"I don\u0027t think they\u0027ll take it any further. And if they did, they couldn\u0027t convict. It\u0027s all right. I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re putting yourself about for.\" \"Perjury, Denis? It\u0027s not a pretty charge.\" \"No,\" said Denis. \"Still, I don\u0027t know that it much matters.\" How quietly he spoke! At Grasmere he had shrunk from the slightest innocent contact with the story; but here was the stain black on his own honor, and it moved him no more than did his friend\u0027s remorse. Gardiner had once said it would go hard with Denis if his idols tumbled off their pedestals. This indifference was worse than his worst fears. Would he ever find his way back? Or was there some hidden mischief, some deadly internal injury at which Gardiner could only guess? What had Dorothea done—what had she killed when she struck her blow? There grew on the young man, watching, a sense of disaster.... Denis had drifted back to the window and stood there, absently whistling his one tune: \"C\u0027est difficile de voir voler Orville; C\u0027est bien plus dur de voir voler Wilbur—\" Suddenly he broke off and bent forward in quick attention. \"Anything up?\" said Gardiner. Denis wheeled and swiftly pushed him back from the window. \"The police.\" [Pg 159] \"What, have they come to pump you again?\" \"No, it\u0027s you they\u0027re after.\" \"Nonsense, man! How can they know I\u0027m here?\" \"Evans has told them.\" \"Who\u0027s Evans?\" \"The man who brings the milk. He was at the door when you arrived. He\u0027s coming up the road with them now.\" \"But how the deuce should Evans—\" \"Your description\u0027s out, and a reward. Five hundred pounds. He must have gone straight off to the police station.\" \"Five hundred pounds!\" Gardiner was as white as his shirt. \"Who offered it?\" Denis would not answer or look at him. There was no need; Gardiner knew well enough who had offered it, and the shock made him sick. Did she indeed hate him so much as all that? \"Well, they\u0027ll save me the trouble of going to Margate,\" he said as lightly as he could, and moved towards the door. Denis stopped him. \"Wait. Think. If you\u0027re taken now, like this, you\u0027ll not be allowed bail. You\u0027ll be in prison till the February Assizes.\" \"—Break me in by degrees!\" said Gardiner in a sort of gasp, still pressing towards the door. Denis still held him back. \"Will you cut it?\" \"How can I?\" \"Quite simple. The monoplane\u0027s out at the back—I told Simpson to have her ready. He\u0027ll swear anything I like to tell him, and Miss Simpson never saw you at all. You\u0027ve only to say the word, and I\u0027ll set you down in France within the hour.\" \"You, Denis? You advise me to run?\" \"Why not?\" said Denis. \"I think the point-of-honor stunt is overdone. It doesn\u0027t pay.\" Gardiner\u0027s ideas of right and wrong were all tumbling about his ears. That Denis should advise such a thing! It[Pg 160] went more than half-way towards making it seem right. It showed, too, that he dreaded the ordeal of the witness-box, and lent a specious color of unselfishness to the plan. And in those last moments of liberty Gardiner, like the prisoner of the Inquisition, seemed to feel the flaming walls sliding together, contracting, closing in upon his life to drive him into the pit.... \"If you\u0027re afraid of a thing\"—That voice again! There was the touchstone. \"No,\" said Gardiner. \"No, I\u0027m damned if I will!\" He walked out and threw open the door to the police. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3250/89056.html","bookId":604,"book":{"id":604,"title":"Convict B14","description":"简介： When men shall say, Peace, and all things are safe, then shall sudden destruction come upon them, as sorrow cometh upon a woman travailing with child, and they shall not escape....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3250","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:01 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:01 AM"}}
