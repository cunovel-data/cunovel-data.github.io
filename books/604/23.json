{"id":31497,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII DIEU DISPOSE","content":"I thought to promote thee unto great honor, but, lo, the Lord hath kept thee back from honor.—Numbers. At the moment when Lettice and Dorothea were sitting down to bread and salt in Canning Street, Denis was leaning over a rustic bridge in the garden of Mrs. Byrne\u0027s week-end cottage. By what difficult, obscure, and tortuous paths he had been wandering in those days he could not have told, nor could any one have followed. Dorothea had done him the worst injury; she had broken his faith. His love and his religion were so closely intertwined that they fell together, with a crash that numbed sensation. The world turned gray and all the lamps went out. If he could not believe in God, Denis could believe in nothing and love nothing. He did not know what was wrong with him; he was not actively and consciously unhappy, but he was bored—sick of himself, sick of his work, sick of all he had been and done in all his life before. He stayed on at Bredon from force of habit, because it was too much trouble to make up his mind to go elsewhere. The trial at Westby broke this routine; and the heavy sentence on his friend, outraging his sense of justice, snapped another of the links that held him to his former life. What was the good of virtue, he asked himself (seriously, as a novel idea), if this was to be its reward? What had he ever got by it himself? Why shouldn\u0027t he try pleasure for a change? Why not, indeed? Conscience made no protest; that was one of the lamps which had gone out. When he left Westby he did not go back to Bredon; he[Pg 196] stayed in town, with the deliberate intention of \"seeing life.\" In pursuit of this ambition he visited music halls, which he regarded as temples of gay vice, and tried to cultivate the more frivolous of his male acquaintance, and even went so far as to put in an appearance at a night club—and was more profoundly bored than ever. One evening he laid himself out conscientiously to get drunk. This was not a success; it ended in a bilious attack and a long distaste for whisky. Another time he sat down to play \"chimmy\" with the most inveterate gamblers he knew. Beginner\u0027s luck helped him at first to win five pounds, which didn\u0027t excite him; then he lost twenty, and was disproportionately annoyed. Nature had not cut out Denis for a roué. He did not amuse himself or any one else. Even Bredon and the seaplane were better than this. He would have given up and gone back to them in despair, if he had not happened to fall in with Mrs. Byrne. She was sitting in her car in a lonely lane at ten o\u0027clock at night when he saw her first, weeping tears of rage because her chauffeur had sunk down, snoring drunk, and she could not stir him. Such things did happen to Mrs. Byrne. Denis came to the rescue; he ejected the chauffeur by the wayside, and took the lady home himself. She was very grateful, and invited him to dinner. It was a pleasant house, and one met amusing people—literary, artistic, a little out of the usual set which had bored Denis so desperately. He liked his pretty, feather-witted hostess, too, and she liked him; indeed, before long it was plain that she more than liked him. It was not plain to Denis, who remained virtuously stiff as a ramrod long after the clubs were betting on Byrne\u0027s chance of bringing off his divorce this time. Mrs. Byrne had fallen headlong in love, and she was incapable of discretion. When at last the truth dawned on Denis, his first impulse was to bolt. But he did not allow himself to do so. He stayed on, deliberately exposing himself to temptation in the hope that it would tempt him. He found it a hard struggle to be wicked. So far, then, Lettice was right; he[Pg 197] had not yet committed himself. She was right, too, in thinking that the scene at Olympia would decide things one way or another. Denis believed himself to be quite indifferent to Dorothea; yet her face (he could not have said how) had given him the slight deciding push, and he returned to Mrs. Byrne with his mind made up. The brook by which he stood, patched with silver by the young March moon, found its way between bronze-stemmed alders, past willows cloudy in pollen-yellow, under banks where the kingcups spread their nosegays of burnished green and gold. Violets, invisible but sweet, clustered at the root of every rose. The scene was set for lovers, and Denis had been making love. Did he do it well? It might have been worse. There had been opposition to overcome, unexpected, stimulating: Evey Byrne with a conscience, forsooth! Denis had tasted the first-fruits of pleasure in crushing down her scruples and making her own she loved him. He had wrung out the confession without mercy. She tried to hold him off with her weak little hands against his breast. \"Ah, but ye don\u0027t truly love me, Denis!\" \"Don\u0027t I?\" said Denis, kissing her fawn-soft eyes and sweet, half-reluctant lips. \"Ah, but \u0027tis so wicked! God\u0027ll never forgive us!\" \"There is no God that counts,\" Denis answered. He kissed her again. He had no idea that in his heart he was kissing Dorothea. That was ten minutes ago. Was it time yet? Hardly, he decided; he might allow himself to finish his cigar. Alas! out of her presence the blaze had all too quickly died down. Mrs. Byrne was sweet, but she bored him like everything else. Still, he would go to her; yes, he would certainly go in a minute. It was his duty to see the thing through. (Naturam expellas furca—it seemed that Denis could not get away from that word!) What a fool he was! Who would believe that he had reached his present age in his present state of innocence? He hoped Mrs. Byrne hadn\u0027t found it out, but he was rather afraid she had. If Denis had been honest with himself he[Pg 198] would have had to admit that one reason why he lingered here by the river, instead of seeking the welcome that awaited him, was that he was shy. Too ignominious, that; he shuffled away from the thought. He was dissatisfied with himself all round. Why couldn\u0027t he behave like other men? In the old days at Bredon how gloriously happy he had been, with the delicate engine of his brain working at full pressure, solving problems faster than his pencil could write them down! Now, it seemed, he could neither play nor work. What was it he had been sticking over, that last evening before he went to Westby? The everlasting difficulty, speed versus safety. There had been one or two rather clever things in the show to-day. The Sturt bus, that used I-struts, as he had meant to do; but the chord of the wings was too large, the stresses would be impossibly high. Why on earth couldn\u0027t Sturt see— Who can tell whence ideas come? Inter-stellar drift? Some beam from the eternal verities shone suddenly in Denis\u0027s brain. He pulled out an old envelope and began covering it with rapid calculations. Ten minutes later, when he next looked up, there was scarcely room for another figure. He had come to a halt; he could go no further without referring to his old work. What time was it? He peered at his watch in the moonlight. Half-past ten: if he got up to town to-night, and slept at the Grosvenor, he could catch the five-forty down and be at Bredon in time for breakfast. He thrust the sheet of calculations into his pocket, and, with about one-twentieth of his mind upon the scene, started for the house. Coming in sight of its lighted windows, however, he slackened and stopped. Mrs. Byrne. There was not much sense left in his head, but it had occurred to him that his errand might be awkward to explain in person. Denis never had been, or would be, afflicted with self-consciousness. He turned back from the lawn, skulked like a burglar through shrubberies and behind trees, and climbed in at the window of the room where they had dined. Still without a thought of false shame, he sat down at Mrs.[Pg 199] Byrne\u0027s own writing-table, and wrote with Mrs. Byrne\u0027s own pen, on her own paper. Another man might have found some difficulty in putting into words what he had to say; to Denis it seemed quite simple. \"My dearest Evey,—I was standing on your bridge just now, thinking of nothing else likely, when suddenly an idea flashed into my head which settles a problem that has worried me for years. If it works out as it should, it will make a revolution in aircraft design. There\u0027s been nothing like it since the Wrights. So I shall have to get straight back into harness. You\u0027ll forgive me, I know.\" Here he paused, and debated whether to quote, \"I could not love thee, dear, so much,\" but decided against it. Mrs. Byrne was not literary. \"One has to put the big things first, hasn\u0027t one? And after all, this hits me even harder than it hits you.\" Denis was pleased with this phrase. \"If all goes well, I will come back and make my apologies in person. I am not waiting now, because I am afraid if I saw you I might not go.\" He was even better pleased with this. A satisfied smile overspread his face as he signed himself, \"Devotedly yours,\" a form which he had never used before, and which took him some time to excogitate. Then he rang the bell, gave the note to a servant, and took himself off—again by the window. \"Make my apologies in person.\" Denis, it will be seen, was not repentant. He returned, as he had promised, a week later, prepared to pick up the thread of his adventure and do his duty to its boring end. He was surprised—surprised and aggrieved—to learn that Mrs. Byrne was not at home. \"But she was expectin\u0027 me!\" he said, quite indignant, to the model of decorum who stood guardian at the gate. \"Yes, sir. She asked me to give you this note,\" said the model without moving an eyelid. But he scanned Denis\u0027s face very inquisitively as he tore open the paper and read: \"Denis darling, this is God. I tried to steal you away from Him, but He won\u0027t let me have you. I knew all the[Pg 200] time how wrong it was. It has all been my fault. I am going where I can pray for you and pray to be forgiven. Oh! don\u0027t be angry with me, and don\u0027t let her be angry with me. I have been very wicked, but I did love you so. \"Evey.\" The decorous Morris, who read this note (for of course Mrs. Byrne had omitted to seal it), got little by his scrutiny. The visitor did not stamp, nor swear, nor turn red, nor pale; he read through his dismissal with a very singular expression of gravity, turned away, came back absently to slip a tip into the man\u0027s hand, and finally strode off down the drive, carrying his handsome head, as poor Camille said of his enemy, like the saint sacrament, his dark blue Irish eyes fixed on far distant horizons.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3250/89061.html","bookId":604,"book":{"id":604,"title":"Convict B14","description":"简介： When men shall say, Peace, and all things are safe, then shall sudden destruction come upon them, as sorrow cometh upon a woman travailing with child, and they shall not escape....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3250","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:01 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:01 AM"}}
