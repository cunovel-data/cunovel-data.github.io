{"id":31499,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXV I SENT A LETTER TO MY LOVE","content":"Savage I was sitting in my house, late, lone: Dreary, weary with the long day\u0027s work: Head of me, heart of me, stupid as a stone: Tongue-tied now, now blaspheming like a Turk; When, in a moment just a knock, call, cry, Half a pang and all a rapture, there again were we!— \"What, and is it really you again?\" quoth I. \"I again, what else did you expect?\" quoth She. The Householder. The gas was not carried up to the attics of No. 22 Canning Street. Late-comers had to stumble in the dark up the last flight of stairs, and bark their shins over the brooms and pails which Beatrice invariably left standing about on the landing. One evening in April Lettice was sitting at work, brow buried in her hands, tensely courting the Muse, when she was startled by a sudden tremendous clatter. The door burst open and Denis fell into the room, in company with a mop and a banister brush. \"Dear, dear!\" said Lettice with her usual inadequacy. \"I wish you\u0027d not keep an ironmonger\u0027s shop on your landing,\" said Denis, annoyed, and rubbing his knee. \"You, you—you are so violent!\" Lettice protested in her pianissimo drawl. She went outside for a moment. \"There, I\u0027ve put them all away in the cupboard, so you won\u0027t have to break your poor nose when you go home,\" she consoled him. \"Now, how nice it is to see you again! And what have you been doing with yourself all this long time?\" \"Selling four monoplanes to the War Office,\" said Denis, with the simple satisfaction of bygone days. \"What do you think of that?\" \"No! have you really?\" \"A man I used to know in the Sappers came over to[Pg 211] Dent-de-lion and fixed up the order last Saturday. It\u0027s been in the air for some time, but of course I couldn\u0027t say anything till it was settled. Wandesforde\u0027s awful pleased. It\u0027s no end of a leg-up for us.\" \"Four all at once!\" cooed his sympathetic hostess. \"Yes, the Government\u0027s rather keen on the Air Service these days. There\u0027s a lot goin\u0027 on we don\u0027t hear anything about—a lot; and they don\u0027t mean to be caught napping.\" \"Did your friend tell you that?\" asked Lettice, interested, as always, in politics. Denis nodded. \"He did. And more. He was askin\u0027 me, among other things, what percentage of our civilian flyers would volunteer in case of a war.\" \"Oh! What did you say?\" \"I said all, of course—every man jack of \u0027em who wasn\u0027t needed as an instructor at home.\" \"You\u0027d go yourself?\" \"Rather so! What do you take me for? I should join up with the R.F.C. at once. Oh, it\u0027s coming, and they know it\u0027s coming; that\u0027s been obvious ever since Agadir. The only question is, when. I hope I shan\u0027t smash myself first. I\u0027d be sorry to be out of the fun.\" He lapsed into silence, leaning back in the big chair which Lettice kept on purpose for him, his long legs extended half across the hearth. How many months was it since he had last filled that place? Lettice had not so much as seen him since the Olympia day; but neither by word nor look did she remind him of the gap. She was an adept at taking things for granted. It was enough to see him sitting there, the same old Denis, talking in the same old way. And yet, not quite the same. Even in his silence there was a new quality. He had matured; he had lived through the wreck of an ideal, and built up his faith again, steady and sure, upon a rock. Lettice put away her papers with delicate neatness, and sat down in a low chair with her needlework—not a green dragon this time, but a pair of combinations, which she darned serenely under the masculine eye. Denis had a nice[Pg 212] mind, he would never see. Now if it had been a certain other person—Lettice made a graceful figure, soft brown hair and hazel eyes, long throat and little head, slight drooping shoulders and slim waist, set off by the soft gray-blue silk of her dress. She was fond of that peculiarly soft and feminine fabric known to dressmakers as crêpe de Chine. She could not spend much on her clothes, but she chose and wore them with that French fineness and perfection of detail which she, in common with her sisters, had learned from their foreign upbringing. \"Well, I didn\u0027t come here to talk about German invasions,\" said Denis, rousing himself. \"The fact is, I\u0027m rather badly worried about Gardiner, Lettice. I didn\u0027t like that last piece of news at all. Did you?\" \"You\u0027ve not heard anything fresh?\" asked Lettice quickly, her work dropping in her lap. \"Not a syllable; and can\u0027t till June. That\u0027s the worst of it; it\u0027s such a deadly long time. I\u0027d half thought of running down there and lookin\u0027 up little Scott—he\u0027s quite a decent little chap, and he\u0027d know. But I suppose it wouldn\u0027t do.\" \"I suppose not,\" agreed Lettice, who was, as has been said, a dandy in affairs of honor. She made her funny little pause to collect words before she got rid of her next speech. \"I suppose if it had gone any further we should have heard by now.\" \"Heard?\" \"The prison people would have let us know.\" \"Let us know what?\" \"Why, if he\u0027d been ill, or gone off his head, or anything of that sort.\" \"You think there\u0027s a danger of his going off his head?\" \"Well, that\u0027s what you\u0027re talking about, isn\u0027t it?\" \"No,\" said Denis, \"I\u0027d not got so far as that.\" He regarded her thoughtfully. \"I wish you\u0027d tell me how it strikes you, Lettice. I can\u0027t see my way at all.\" \"There\u0027s nothing to tell,\" said Lettice, a trifle restless at being asked to explain the obvious. \"He must have[Pg 213] been off his balance to hit a warder, mustn\u0027t he? And when that begins, with anybody like him, you never know where it will stop. He isn\u0027t any too steady.\" (Certainly there was no one like Lettice for pulling things off pedestals. Hitting a warder—it didn\u0027t sound nearly so bad as assaulting an officer!) \"Well, I\u0027ve known Gardiner five and twenty years, and I\u0027d never have called him unsteady. Hard as nails, more like.\" \"So he is that too.\" \"Now what on earth do you mean?\" \"Well, of course he\u0027d be hard so long as he hadn\u0027t anything to face he really minded, wouldn\u0027t he? And till this he didn\u0027t, did he? It\u0027s what you said yourself—he\u0027s always been lucky. But if you get him off his guard he\u0027s rather unusually sensitive. Look at the way he feels pain!\" \"I never saw him feel pain. In my company he\u0027s always been brutally robust.\" \"Well, but can\u0027t you tell he would, by the set of his lips?\" \"No,\" said Denis, \"I can\u0027t. I\u0027ve not your imagination.\" To this Lettice made no reply, unless one might count the slight derisive lift of her chin. She never would take up the personal question. She would never, if she could help it, say: \"I thought.\" She was sometimes driven to say, \"I did,\" but even then she kept to the bald facts, uncolored by her personality. Denis, shifting in his chair to a more convenient angle, continued to regard her with attention, in which now mingled some amusement. \"Oh ah,\" he said, \"you were there when he damaged his hand, weren\u0027t you? I\u0027d forgotten. How long was it you stayed on at Rochehaut after I left?\" \"About six weeks.\" \"And you were actin\u0027 as his secretary all that time?\" \"Part of it.\" \"Of course that accounts.\" \"Accounts what for?\" asked Lettice unwisely, with her little air of distraction. [Pg 214] \"For the sympathetic insight you display,\" said Denis, now openly smiling. Lettice had chaffed him all her life; it was a new thing for him to turn the tables. \"He swears it was you sent him back, and I believe him now. You\u0027ve eased my mind quite a lot. He won\u0027t go under. He may knock out a warder or so, but he\u0027ll come through all right in the end—with such backin\u0027!\" \"Rubbish,\" said Lettice with acerb decision. She folded her work, got up, lighted a small paraffin lamp and carried it outside. Denis watched her hang it on the wall above the stairs. \"Is that a gentle hint to me to be off?\" he asked, still smiling, as she re?ntered. \"Because if so I\u0027m not takin\u0027 any. I\u0027ll go when my time comes, but there\u0027s ten minutes yet.\" \"It\u0027s not for you at all, it\u0027s for Dot O\u0027Connor.\" \"For Dot O\u0027Connor!\" \"She always tumbles over the brooms worse than you did,\" Lettice explained, \"so I give her a light on the stairs when I\u0027m expecting her to supper. I\u0027d have given you one, too, if I\u0027d known you were coming.\" She had banished Denis\u0027s smile. He shifted in his chair once more, but this time away from her. \"Dot O\u0027Connor!\" he repeated for the third time, in that altered voice. \"Do you mean Mrs. Trent?\" \"She doesn\u0027t like being called that now.\" \"Do you see much of her?\" \"So so,\" said Lettice. She had mentioned Dorothea, not to get away from Denis\u0027s chaff—that would have been too cruel—but of set purpose, because there was something she had to say before he went. \"Will you stay and have supper with us? I think there\u0027ll be enough to go round, if you aren\u0027t too hungry.\" \"No, Lettice.\" \"I don\u0027t see why you shouldn\u0027t.\" \"Don\u0027t you?\" His tone was not encouraging, but it made not a pin\u0027s difference to Lettice; her difficulties came always from within,[Pg 215] not from without, and once she had made up her mind to speak all the king\u0027s horses and all the king\u0027s men would not have stopped her. She did not imagine that she could move Denis, but there were certain things he ought to know, and which, in justice to Dorothea, she meant to set before him. They would not move him now, but he would not forget them; and in time to come they might sink in and soften his judgment. \"I don\u0027t see why you shouldn\u0027t forgive her,\" she pronounced. \"I\u0027d rather not discuss it.\" \"Very well, don\u0027t you say anything, but will you listen?\" Denis moved restlessly in his chair. \"You\u0027re too hard on her,\" said Lettice, hitting straight and hard. \"You will treat her as a woman, when she\u0027s only a child. And you don\u0027t realize what marrying a—a beast like that does to a girl. It bruises her innocence. It\u0027s like tearing open the eyes of a blind kitten. You can\u0027t expect her to see right and wrong like other people.\" So far beyond herself had Lettice been carried by that potent loosener of tongues, a sense of injustice! She went on with the same resolute candor: \"Besides, there\u0027s another thing. She loves you. And she can love; you won\u0027t meet what she has to give twice in a lifetime. I know\"—Lettice spoke with an effort; it was as near to an avowal as she could go, and the fact that she thought her cause worth such a sacrifice added tenfold to the weight of her words—\"I know she\u0027s often made me ashamed of my stockishness. Are you prepared to throw all that away?\" She had finished, and she stopped. Denis sat silent, staring into the fire and pulling absently at his forelock, a trick he had when deep in thought. The soft sounds of Lettice\u0027s business did not break the stillness of the room. The alarm clock which Denis had given her to get up by in the morning (Lettice had long been mortally afraid of the alarm, and she still handled it as gingerly as if she expected it to explode) ticked on through the stillness. It struck seven; Denis glanced at his watch, and got up. [Pg 216] \"I must go,\" he said confusedly. \"I—I\u0027d no idea it was so late.\" He took his hat and stick, and Lettice thought he was really going then and there, without another word; but he thought better of it, and from the landing came back and stood in the doorway, visibly struggling with himself. \"You—you mustn\u0027t think I mind what you said, Lettice,\" he got out. \"I\u0027d always listen to you. But I can\u0027t do this—I can\u0027t—\" Lettice looked him in the face. \"She would have something to forgive you now,\" she said deliberately. \"No, she would not,\" said Denis with equal deliberation; and he met her eyes, fair and square. \"But that\u0027s not anything to do with it. It\u0027s not a question of forgiveness. It\u0027s—I—oh, I can\u0027t do it, Lettice—I can\u0027t explain—\" \"Well—\" said Lettice, summing up with that sad, vague word which looks back, unsatisfied, over the past, and forward, unhopeful, towards the future. And that was all she learned, then or for many months to come, of Denis\u0027s feelings for Dorothea, of his wanderings in the wilderness, of the manner of his deliverance. Not till many months later, in alien scenes, in unimaginable circumstances, in a different world, did he reopen that subject. He straightened himself, glancing again at his watch. \"I really must go. I\u0027m dinin\u0027 with the Wandesfordes, to celebrate, and I\u0027ll never hear the last of it if I\u0027m late. Wandesforde always thinks he can do the funny dog about Irish people—silly ass. Wish you were coming too.\" \"Me?\" asked Lettice, opening her eyes. \"You. It\u0027s not much fun sittin\u0027 here alone and thinkin\u0027 about things—is it?\" said Denis; and to her wide amazement he put a brotherly arm round her and kissed her cheek. Lettice turned slowly and deeply pink; not on account of the kiss, however. She took her lamp and stood torch-bearer to light him down the stairs. When the quick military tread had reached the lower landing she was turning back to her room, but a quick scuffle in the cupboard and a breathless voice stopped her. [Pg 217] \"Lettice—wait!\" And Dorothea scrambled out from among the brooms and brushes, bringing a shower of them with her. \"Oh, bother!\" said she, turning to stuff them back unceremoniously, and precipitating a fresh avalanche. Lettice found her voice again. \"You—you\u0027ve got a black on your nose,\" she remarked originally. \"So would any one have, in this horrid little hole! I\u0027d just reached the landing when your door opened, and I bundled straight in here, and all the things fell every which way, and I had to clutch them up in both hands all the time. I made sure you\u0027d hear.\" \"I did,\" said Lettice, \"but I thought it was Black Maria.\" \"Well, I\u0027d be Black Maria if I could, I know you\u0027d like me better,\" retorted Dorothea, expending the last of her temper in a spiteful kick at a pail, and slamming the door before more disasters could happen. \"But oh, Lettice, oh, Lettice, isn\u0027t it glorious news?\" \"You heard what we were saying?\" \"Well, of course. How could I help it? You can\u0027t put your fingers in your ears when you\u0027re holding up six brooms and a mop. I heard every word. And I don\u0027t care! I don\u0027t care a scrap! Oh, I am so glad!\" \"Glad?\" Lettice repeated. She had not known quite what to expect; certainly not this. How the child\u0027s eyes were sparkling! \"Well, of course!\" she cried. \"Didn\u0027t you hear? Didn\u0027t you see what he was like? Oh! now I know that\u0027s all right I don\u0027t care about anything else—I don\u0027t care what happens, so long as that doesn\u0027t!\" She flung herself down on the rug with a tempestuous sigh, and tried to dry her eyes on a wisp of lace. That proving inadequate, she rummaged through half a dozen pockets and dragged out a dingy red square which had evidently been used as an oil rag. She held it out by the corners. \"Oh dear, I must have stolen Turner\u0027s—oh dear, I wish I could manage to hit something between a doily[Pg 218] and a duster—never mind, a hanky\u0027s a hanky,\" said she, and blew her nose and dried her tears forthwith. Then, looking up sharply, \"Lettice! why don\u0027t you say something? Aren\u0027t you pleased too?\" \"O-oh, oh yes,\" said Lettice hastily; \"only you see I\u0027d had time to get over it before you came.\" \"I shan\u0027t get over it—I shan\u0027t ever get over it,\" murmured Dorothea, nestling round to gaze into the fire. \"You don\u0027t know how awful it\u0027s been to feel that on me. I\u0027d rather I killed him than see that woman—Do you know, Lettice, I do think there must be a God after all. I didn\u0027t ever use to, but ever since that Olympia day I\u0027ve been praying, oh! so hard, that He\u0027d save Denis—I didn\u0027t see how even God could stop him then, but there wasn\u0027t anything else I could do, and I just had to do something. And now you see he has. He didn\u0027t tell you anything about how it happened?\" Lettice shook her head. \"Oh, well, that doesn\u0027t really matter, it\u0027s his being saved that counts,\" said Dorothea, relapsing again into one of her boneless attitudes, and smiling rosily over clasped hands into the fire. \"Did you hear—\" began Lettice. \"What he said about me? Oh yes. Well, of course I\u0027d love to have him forgive me, but I know he couldn\u0027t possibly, and anyway I don\u0027t matter about,\" said Dorothea, her voice softened into dreams. \"It\u0027s him—it\u0027s him. It does mean such a lot, Lettice! It isn\u0027t only that he is what he used to be, what I thought he never could be again; it\u0027s ever so much more than that. Denis wasn\u0027t made to think of women as he thought of—of me and Mrs. Byrne. He was made to marry, Lettice. Can\u0027t you see how perfectly sweet he\u0027d be to his wife?—yes, and to his boys and girls too; how he\u0027d love them (I expect he\u0027d have a pet little girl, and call her Letty), and how they\u0027d all adore him? He\u0027s one of those men who—who only truly mellow in their own homes. If he could only find some nice girl who\u0027ll love him—no, not better than me, nobody ever could do that, but well enough to make up to him for the horrid little wretch I\u0027ve been—I [Pg 219]wish you would, Lettice, but I\u0027m afraid that\u0027s past praying for.\" \"Me?\" said Lettice. \"I don\u0027t think that would do.\" \"Why not?\" demanded Dorothea. Lettice failing to reply at once, she whisked round suddenly, with an eel-like twist. \"Why do you say it like that? Why aren\u0027t you gladder? Is there anything wrong? There is, there is! Oh, Lettice, what is it?\" She was kneeling up now, and had seized Lettice\u0027s hands. \"You\u0027re making me spill the milk, and I can\u0027t get any more,\" Lettice warned her; but she was not to be diverted. \"You\u0027ve been worried for ages, only I\u0027ve been such a blind donkey thinking of Denis I haven\u0027t noticed,\" she cried. \"Why did he say you oughtn\u0027t to be let sit alone and think? What did he mean? Lettice—oh, Lettice! is it about Mr. Gardiner? Have you any bad news? Oh, don\u0027t, don\u0027t tell me I\u0027ve done that too!\" Lettice freed herself summarily. Dorothea had room in her little head for but one idea at a time, and therefore was apt to overlook what lay under her little nose; but, her attention once aroused, she was keen on a scent, and her intuition, the prerogative of semi-civilized minds, had a way of landing her dead on the truth. Now there were certain things which Denis might be permitted to see, but which Dorothea might not—no! not on any account. \"There isn\u0027t any news at all, if you want to know,\" she said. \"He hit a warder, so all his letters and things have been stopped off.\" \"But isn\u0027t Denis going to visit him quite soon?\" \"That\u0027s stopped too.\" \"Oh!\" said Dorothea blankly, \"oh dear! I see.\" She did see, only too plainly. Oh, what a little donkey she had been! But who would ever have imagined that Lettice—and with Mr. Gardiner, of all people! oh, how could she? She did, though, no doubt about that, and with Lettice that would mean a dreadfully big thing, the whole of her life, and—oh, good gracious! how she would simply hate to have[Pg 220] any one know! Oh, she mustn\u0027t, she mustn\u0027t be allowed to guess! All this passed through Dorothea\u0027s mind in the space of half-a-second, and under the stimulus of that last thought she pulled herself round, with a mighty effort, to ask as innocently as she could: \"Did—did Denis know about this the day of the show?\" \"He\u0027d just heard.\" \"Oh,\" said Dorothea, \"oh, I wonder he didn\u0027t strike me to the ground! Oh, how wicked, how wicked I\u0027ve been!\" There was nothing visible but the red handkerchief. Lettice looked at her sharply; but the pose was so natural, and any pose seemed so foreign to Dorothea, and Lettice so much wanted to be taken in, that she was. Not wholly; but she stuck her head in the sand and refused to see her own doubts. And behind the red handkerchief Dorothea, too much overwhelmed to cry, sat among the ruins which she had pulled down on her own head and wondered helplessly when she would see the end of all the harm she had done. \"I was so happy about Denis, and now there\u0027s this!\" Her love for Denis had been a sort of sublimated selfishness, but now she was thinking about other people—about Lettice, yes, and about Gardiner, though there she was all at sea. \"I don\u0027t know what I\u0027ve done to him, but it must be something very bad for Lettice to be like this!\" she reflected. \"But, oh dear! after all, what should I feel like if it were Denis in prison? And what would he feel like himself? And Mr. Gardiner\u0027s led such a free sort of out-of-doors life—\" In the depths below a bell rang; Beatrice\u0027s feet pounded up from the basement. They came on from flight to flight, up the bare boards to the attics, and ended with a single bang on the door. \"Miss Lettus, \u0027s a letter for you!\" Lettice went with her soft, unhurried step to take it in. She carried it to the lamp, and stood arrested, staring at the envelope. Dorothea was sitting up, her dark hair tumbling about her eyes. \"Oh, Lettice, what is it?\" \"From the prison,\" said Lettice, opening the envelope and drawing out the enclosure with a steady hand. From across[Pg 221] the room Dorothea could see that it was not in Gardiner\u0027s handwriting; and then she saw Lettice\u0027s face change, and her heart turned over in her breast. \"Lettice—!\" \"What?\" said Lettice, absorbed. \"O-oh no, it\u0027s all right; it\u0027s only that—he\u0027s hurt his hand—\" Dorothea turned her face to the wall and said her prayers. This was the letter which Lettice received: Dear Miss Smith,—I have permission to write you a short note on business. I am anxious about my hotel. It has been in the hands of a caretaker all winter; but for the summer season I had arranged for my housekeeper to come back, and most of the servants. The housekeeper is a trustworthy person, and quite competent to run the place herself; but I can\u0027t very well give her carte blanche with my banking account, and I\u0027m sure she wouldn\u0027t accept it if I did. What I want is somebody to sign checks, manage the correspondence, and act as figurehead. Practically what you did last year. Will you take it on again? I should have every confidence in you, and of course it is your proper place. As far as I know at present, I propose, if it suits you, to be married as soon as I leave in October, and go out to Rochehaut for the winter. Please let me know if this fits in with your views. I must apologize for my writing, but I have been laid up in hospital with a touch of the old trouble in my hand. When I come out, I believe I am to go on the farm. The governor has most kindly remitted the rest of my punishment, and I shall be allowed to see a visitor next month as usual. Will you let Merion-Smith know, if you are writing to him? Sincerely, H. C. Gardiner. Dorothea at first had turned her eyes scrupulously away; but they were back now, and searching Lettice\u0027s face for news. That face wore a decidedly queer and pensive look. She refolded the letter with careful exactness. [Pg 222] \"Well? What does he say?\" \"O-oh, he wants me to go out to Rochehaut and look after his old hotel.\" \"Then he\u0027s all right? He isn\u0027t ill or anything? Denis won\u0027t have to be anxious any more?\" \"He\u0027s in hospital, but it\u0027s nothing much.\" Lettice read out what Gardiner said about his hand, and the description of her duties as well. But she did not read those sentences of barefaced impudence which transformed an apparently decorous business communication into a proposal of marriage. Dorothea drew a long breath. \"And you\u0027ll do it, Lettice? You\u0027ll go? Oh! may I come too? I won\u0027t be intense, truly I won\u0027t, and perhaps I might even help you a little—I would love to do something for Mr. Gardiner, to try and make up for all the harm I\u0027ve done him! You are going yourself, anyhow, aren\u0027t you?\" \"Oh, I suppose so,\" said Lettice, with a long-suffering air. This was in the month of April, 1914.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3250/89063.html","bookId":604,"book":{"id":604,"title":"Convict B14","description":"简介： When men shall say, Peace, and all things are safe, then shall sudden destruction come upon them, as sorrow cometh upon a woman travailing with child, and they shall not escape....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3250","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:01 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:01 AM"}}
