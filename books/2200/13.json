{"id":101500,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"Judith began her story by asking me a question. \"Have you ever met Lorena?\"\n \"Yes,\" I said, and left it at that. Evidently, Judith didn\u0027t know exactly how I\u0027d met Lorena, which had been a few seconds before I drove a stake through her heart and ended her long, nasty life.\n \"Then you know she\u0027s ruthless.\"\n I nodded.\n \"You need to know why I\u0027ve stayed away from Bill all these years, when I\u0027m very fond of him,\" Judith said. \"Lorena has had a hard life. I wouldn\u0027t necessarily believe everything she\u0027s told me, but I\u0027ve heard confirmation of a few parts of it from others.\" Judith wasn\u0027t seeing me anymore; she was looking past me, down the years, I guess.\n \"How old was she?\" I said, just to keep the story rolling.\n \"By the time Lorena met Bill she had been a vampire for many decades. She had been turned in 1788 by a man named Solomon Brunswick. He met her in a brothel in New Orleans.\"\n \"He met her in the obvious way?\"\n \"Not exactly. He was there to take blood from another whore, one who specialized in the odder desires of men. Compared to some of her other customers, a little bite wasn\u0027t anything too remarkable.\"\n \"Had Solomon been a vampire a long time?\" I was curious despite myself. Vampires as living history ... Well, since they\u0027d come out of the coffin, they\u0027d added a lot to college courses. Bring a vampire to class to tell his or her story, and you got great attendance.\n \"Solomon had been a vampire for twenty years by then. He became a vampire by accident. He was a sort of tinker. He sold pots and pans, and he mended broken ones. He had other goods that were hard to find in New England then: needles, thread, odds and ends like that. He took his horse and cart from town to town and farm to farm, all by himself. Solomon encountered one of us while he camped in the woods one night. He told me that he survived the first encounter, but the vampire followed him during the night to his next camp and attacked him again. This second attack was a critical one. Solomon was one of the unfortunates who get turned accidentally. Since the vampire who drank from him left him for dead, unaware of the change - or at least, I like to think so - Solomon was untrained and had to learn all by himself.\"\n \"Sounds really awful,\" I said, and I meant that.\n She nodded. \"It must have been. He worked his way down to New Orleans to avoid people who wondered why he hadn\u0027t aged. Where he came upon Lorena. After he\u0027d had his meal, he was leaving out the back when he spotted her in the dark courtyard. She was with a man. The customer tried to leave without paying, and in the blink of an eye Lorena seized him and cut his throat.\"\n That sounded like the Lorena I\u0027d known.\n \"Solomon was impressed with her savagery and excited by the fresh blood. He grabbed the dying man and drained him, and when he threw the body into the yard of the next house, Lorena was impressed and fascinated. She wanted to be like he was.\"\n \"That sounds about right.\"\n Judith smiled faintly. \"She was illiterate but tenacious and a tremendous survivor. He was far more intelligent, but he had poor killing skills. By then, he had figured some things out, and so he was able to bring her over. They took blood from each other sometimes, and that gave them the courage to find others like us, to learn what they needed to learn to live well instead of merely surviving. The two of them practiced how to be successful vampires, tested the limits of their new natures, and made an excellent team.\"\n \"So Solomon was your grandfather, since he begat Lorena,\" I said biblically. \"What happened after that?\"\n \"Eventually, the bloom went off the rose,\" Judith said. \"Makers and their children stay together longer than a merely sexual couple but not forever. Lorena betrayed Solomon. She was caught with the half-drained body of a dead child, but she was able to play a human woman pretty convincingly. She told the men who grabbed her that Solomon was the one who\u0027d killed the child, that he\u0027d made her carry the body, so the blood was all over her. Solomon barely got out of the town alive - they were in Natchez, Mississippi. He never saw Lorena again. He\u0027s never met Bill, either. Lorena found him after the War between the States.\n \"As Bill later told me, one night Lorena was wandering through this area. It was much harder then to stay concealed, especially in rural areas. There weren\u0027t as many people to hunt you down, true, and there was little or no communication. But strangers were conspicuous and with the thinner population, the choices of prey were less. An individual death was noticed more. A body had to be hidden very carefully, or the death meticulously staged. At least there wasn\u0027t much organized law enforcement.\"\n I reminded myself not to look disgusted. This knowledge was nothing new. That was how vampires had lived until a few years ago.\n \"Lorena saw Bill and his family through the windows of their house.\" Judith looked away. \"She fell in love. For several nights, she listened to the family. During the day she would dig a hole in the woods and bury herself. At night, she\u0027d watch.\n \"Finally, she decided to act. She realized - even Lorena realized - Bill would never forgive her if she killed his children, so she waited until he came out in the middle of the night to find out why the dog wouldn\u0027t stop barking. When Bill came out with his rifle, she crept up behind him and took him.\"\n I thought of Lorena, so close to my own family, right through the woods... . She could have come to my great-great-grandparents\u0027 place just as easily, and my whole family history would have been different.\n \"She turned him that night, buried him, and helped him resurrect three nights later.\"\n I couldn\u0027t imagine how shattered Bill must have been. Everything gone in the blink of an eye: his whole life taken and altered and given back to him in a terrible form.\n \"I guess she took him away from here,\" I said.\n \"Yes, that was essential. She had arranged a death for him. She\u0027d smeared a clearing with his blood and left his gun there and rags from his clothing. He told me it looked as though a panther had gotten him. So they traveled together, and while he was bound to her, he hated her, too. He was miserable with her, but she remained obsessed with him. After thirty years, she tried to make him happier by killing a woman who looked very much like his wife.\"\n \"Oh, gosh,\" I said, trying not to feel sick. \"You, huh?\" That was why her face had been vaguely familiar. I\u0027d seen Bill\u0027s old family pictures.\n Judith nodded. \"Evidently, Bill saw me entering a neighbor\u0027s house, going to a party with my family. He followed me home and watched me, because the resemblance caught his fancy. When Lorena discovered this new interest, she thought Bill would stay with her if she provided him with a companion.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said. \"I\u0027m really, really sorry.\"\n Judith shrugged. \"It wasn\u0027t Bill\u0027s fault, but you\u0027ll understand why I had to think about it before I came in answer to your message. Solomon is in Europe now, or I would have asked him to come with me. I dread seeing Lorena again, and I was afraid ... afraid she would be here, afraid you would have asked her to help Bill, too. Or she might have made up this story to bring me here, for all I knew. Is she ... Is she around?\"\n \"She\u0027s dead. Didn\u0027t you know?\"\n Judith\u0027s round blue eyes went wide. She couldn\u0027t be any more pale, but her eyes closed for a long moment. \"I felt a strong wrench around eighteen months ago... . That was Lorena\u0027s death?\"\n I nodded.\n \"That\u0027s why she hasn\u0027t summoned me. Oh, this is wonderful, wonderful!\"\n Judith looked like a different woman.\n \"I guess I\u0027m a little surprised that Bill didn\u0027t get in touch with you to tell you.\"\n \"Maybe he thought I would know it. Children and makers are bound. But I wasn\u0027t sure. It seemed too good to be true.\" Judith smiled, and she looked suddenly pretty, even with the fangs. \"Where is Bill?\"\n \"He\u0027s through the woods.\" I pointed in the right direction. \"In his old home.\"\n \"I\u0027ll be able to track him once I\u0027m outside,\" she said happily. \"Oh, to be with him without Lorena near!\"\n Ah. What?\n Before, it had been okay for Judith to sit and talk my ear off, but now all of a sudden, she was ready to take off like a scalded cat. I was sitting there with my eyes narrowed, wondering what I\u0027d done.\n \"I\u0027ll heal him, and I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll thank you after,\" she said, and I felt like I\u0027d been dismissed. \"Was Bill there when Lorena died?\"\n \"Yeah,\" I said.\n \"Did he suffer much punishment for killing her?\"\n \"He didn\u0027t kill her,\" I said. \"I did.\"\n She froze, staring at me as if I\u0027d suddenly announced I was King Kong. She said, \"I owe you my freedom. Bill must think very highly of you.\"\n \"I believe he does,\" I said. To my embarrassment, she bent to kiss my hand. Her lips were cold.\n \"Bill and I can be together now,\" she said. \"Finally! I\u0027ll see you another night to tell you how grateful I am, but now I have to go to him.\" And she was out of the house and zipping through the woods to the south before I could say Jack Robinson.\n I kind of felt like a very large fist had hit me upside the head.\n I would be a total sleaze to feel anything but happy for Bill. Now he could hang around with Judith for centuries, if he wanted to. With the never-aging duplicate of his wife. I made myself smile with gladness.\n When looking happy didn\u0027t make me happy, I did twenty jumping jacks, then twenty push-ups. Okay, that\u0027s better, I thought, as I lay on my stomach on the living room floor. Now I was ashamed that my arm muscles were trembling. I remembered the workouts the Lady Falcons softball coach had put us through, and I knew Coach Peterson would kick my butt if she could see me now. On the other hand, I wasn\u0027t seventeen anymore.\n As I rolled over to lie on my back, I considered that fact soberly. It wasn\u0027t the first occasion I\u0027d felt the passage of time, but it was the first occasion that I\u0027d noticed my body had changed into something a little less efficient. I had to contrast that with the lot of the vampires I knew. At least 99 percent of them had become vamps at the peak of their lives. There were a few who had been younger, like Alexei, and a few who had been older, like the Ancient Pythoness, but most of them had ranged in age from sixteen to thirty-five at the time of their first death. They\u0027d never have to apply for Social Security or Medicare. They\u0027d never need to worry about hip replacements or lung cancer or arthritis.\n By the time I reached middle age (if I was so lucky, since my life was what you would call \"high risk\"), I would be slowing down in perceptible ways. After that, the wrinkles would only grow and deepen, my skin would look looser on my bones and sport a spot or two, and my hair would thin out. My chin would sag a little, and my boobs would, too. My joints would ache when I sat too long in one position. I\u0027d have to get reading glasses.\n I might develop high blood pressure. I might have a blocked artery. My heart might beat irregularly. When I got the flu, I would be very sick. I\u0027d fear Parkinson\u0027s, Alzheimer\u0027s, a stroke, pneumonia ... the boogie-bears that hid under the beds of the aging.\n What if I told Eric I wanted to be with him forever? Assuming he didn\u0027t scream and run as fast as he could in the other direction, assuming he actually changed me, I tried to imagine what being a vampire would be like. I would watch all my friends grow old and die. I would sleep in the hidey-hole in the closet floor myself. If Jason married Michele, she might not like me holding their babies. I would feel the urge to attack people, to bite them; they\u0027d all be walking McBloodburgers to me. I\u0027d think of people as food. I stared up at the ceiling fan and tried to imagine wanting to bite Andy Bellefleur or Holly. Ick.\n On the other hand, I\u0027d never be sick again unless someone shot me or bit me with silver, or staked me, or put me out in the sun. I could protect frail humans from danger. I could be with Eric forever ... except for that bit where vampire couples usually didn\u0027t stay together all that long.\n Okay, I could still be with Eric for a few years.\n How would I make my living? I could only take the later shift at Merlotte\u0027s, and that after dark had fallen, if Sam let me keep my job. And Sam, too, would grow old and die. A new owner might not like having a permanent barmaid who could only work one shift. I could go back to college and take night classes and computer classes until I got some kind of degree. In what?\n I\u0027d reached the limit of my imagination. I rolled to my knees and rose from the floor, wondering if I was imagining a slight stiffness in my joints.\n Sleep was long in coming that night, despite my very long and very scary day. The silence of the house pressed in around me. Claude came home in the wee hours, whistling.\n When I got up the next morning, not bright but way too early, I felt sluggish and dispirited. I found two envelopes shoved under my front door on my way to the porch with my coffee. The first note was from Mr. Cataliades, and it had been hand-delivered by his niece Diantha at three a.m., she\u0027d noted on the envelope. I was sorry to miss a chance to talk to Diantha, though I was grateful she hadn\u0027t woken me. I opened that envelope first out of sheer curiosity. \"Dear Miss Stackhouse,\" Mr. Cataliades wrote. \"Here is a check for the amount in Claudine Crane\u0027s account when she passed away. She wanted you to have it.\"\n Short and to the point, which was more than most people I\u0027d talked to recently. I flipped the check over and found that it was for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\n \"Oh my God,\" I said out loud. \"Oh my God.\" I dropped it because my fingers suddenly lost their power, and the check drifted down to the porch. I scrambled to retrieve it and read it again to make sure I hadn\u0027t been mistaken.\n \"Oh,\" I said. I was sticking with the classics, because saying anything else seemed to be beyond me. I couldn\u0027t even imagine what I would do with so much money. That was beyond me, too. I had to give myself a little space until I could think about this unexpected legacy with any rational plan.\n I carried the amazing check into the house and put it in a drawer, terrified something would happen to it before I got it to the bank. Only when I was sure it was safe did I even think of opening my other note, which was from Bill.\n I carried it back out to the porch chair and took a gulp of my cooling coffee. I tore open the envelope.\n \"Dearest Sookie - I didn\u0027t want to frighten you by knocking on your door at two in the morning, so I\u0027m leaving this for you to read in the daylight. I wondered why you had been in my house last week. I knew you\u0027d come in, and I knew that sooner or later your motive would become apparent. Your generous heart has given me the cure I needed.\n \"I never thought I would see Judith after the last time we parted. There were reasons I didn\u0027t call her over the years. I understand she told you why Lorena picked her to turn vampire. Lorena didn\u0027t ask me before she attacked Judith. Please believe this. I would never condemn someone to our life unless she wanted it and told me so.\"\n Okay, Bill was giving me credit for some complicated thinking. I\u0027d never dreamed of suspecting that Bill had asked Lorena to find him a mate resembling his late wife.\n \"I would never have been brave enough to contact Judith myself for fear she hated me. I am so glad to see her again. And her blood, freely given, has already worked a great healing in me.\"\n All right! That had been the whole point.\n \"Judith has agreed to stay for a week so we can \u0027catch up\u0027 with each other. Maybe you will join us some evening? Judith was most impressed with your kindness. Love, Bill.\"\n I forced myself to smile down at the folded piece of paper. I\u0027d just write him right back and tell him how pleased I was that he was better and that he\u0027d renewed his old relationship with Judith. Of course, I hadn\u0027t been happy when he was dating Selah Pumphrey, a human real estate dealer, because we had only recently broken up, and I knew he didn\u0027t really care about her. Now I was determined to be happy for Bill. I was not going to be one of those awful people who gets all bent out of shape when the ex acquires a replacement. That was hypocritical and selfish to the extreme, and I hoped I was a better person than that. At least I was determined to provide a good imitation of such a person.\n \"Okay,\" I said to my coffee mug. \"That turned out great.\"\n \"Would you rather talk to me than to your coffee?\" Claude asked.\n I\u0027d heard feet on the creaky stairs through the open window, and I\u0027d registered that another brain was up and working, but I hadn\u0027t foreseen that he\u0027d join me on the porch.\n \"You got in late,\" I said. \"You want me to get you a cup of coffee? I made plenty.\"\n \"No, thank you. I\u0027ll have some pineapple juice in a minute. It\u0027s a beautiful day.\" Claude was shirtless. At least he was wearing drawstring pants with the Dallas Cowboys all over them. Ha! He wished!\n \"Yeah,\" I said, with a marked lack of enthusiasm. Claude raised one perfectly shaped black eyebrow.\n \"Who\u0027s down in the dumps?\" he asked.\n \"No, I\u0027m very happy.\"\n \"Yes, I can see the joy written all over your face. What\u0027s the matter, Cousin?\"\n \"I did get the check from Claudine\u0027s estate. God bless her. That was so generous.\" I looked up at Claude, putting all my sincerity into my face. \"Claude, I hope you\u0027re not mad at me. That\u0027s just ... so much money. I haven\u0027t got a clue what I want to do with it.\"\n Claude shrugged. \"That was what Claudine wished. Now, tell me what\u0027s wrong.\"\n \"Claude, you\u0027ll have to excuse me being surprised that you care. I would\u0027ve said you didn\u0027t give a flying eff how I felt. Now you\u0027re being all sweet with Hunter, and you\u0027re offering to help me clean out the attic.\"\n \"Maybe I\u0027m developing a cousinly concern for you.\" He raised one eyebrow.\n \"Maybe pigs will fly.\"\n He laughed. \"I\u0027m trying to be more human,\" he confessed. \"Since I\u0027ll live out my long existence among humans, apparently, I\u0027m trying to be more ...\"\n \"Likable?\" I supplied.\n \"Ouch,\" he said, but he wasn\u0027t really hurt. Being hurt would presuppose that he cared about my opinion. And that was something you couldn\u0027t be taught, right?\n \"Where\u0027s the boyfriend been?\" he asked. \"I do so love the smell of vampire around the house.\"\n \"Last night was the first time I\u0027ve seen him in a week. And we didn\u0027t have any alone time.\"\n \"You two have a fight?\" Claude settled one hip on the porch railing, and I could tell he was determined to show me he could be interested in someone else\u0027s life.\n I felt a certain amount of exasperation. \"Claude, I\u0027m drinking my very first cup of coffee, I didn\u0027t get a lot of sleep, and I\u0027ve had a bad few days. Could you just scoot away and take a shower or something?\"\n He sighed as if I\u0027d broken his heart. \"All right, I can take a hint,\" he said.\n \"That really wasn\u0027t so much a hint as an outright statement.\"\n \"Oh, I\u0027ll go.\"\n But as he straightened up and took a step toward the door, I realized I did have something else to say. \"I take that back. There is something we have to talk about,\" I said. \"I haven\u0027t had a chance to tell you that Dermot was here.\"\n Claude stood up straight, almost as if he were prepared to bolt. \"What did he say? What did he want?\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure what he wanted. I think, like you, he wanted to be close to someone else with a bit of fairy blood. And he wanted to tell me that he was under a spell.\"\n Claude paled. \"From whose magic? Has Grandfather come back through the gate?\"\n \"No,\" I said. \"But could a fairy have cast a spell on him before the gate closed? And I think you must know there\u0027s another full-blooded fairy on this side of the portal, or gate, whatever you call it.\" As I understood fairy morals, it was not possible to answer me with a direct lie.\n \"Dermot is crazy,\" Claude said. \"I have no idea what he\u0027ll do next. If he approached you directly, he must be under extreme pressure. You know how ambivalent he is about humans.\"\n \"You didn\u0027t answer my question.\"\n \"No,\" Claude said. \"I didn\u0027t. And there\u0027s a reason for that.\" He turned his back to me and looked out over the yard. \"I like my head on my shoulders.\"\n \"So there is someone else around, and you know who it is. Or you know more about putting spells on than you\u0027re admitting?\"\n \"I\u0027m not going to talk about it.\" And Claude went inside. Within minutes, I heard him going out the back of the house, and his car passed by on its way down the drive to Hummingbird Road.\n So I had gained a valuable piece of knowledge that was completely useless. I couldn\u0027t summon up the fairy, ask the fairy why he or she was still on this side, what his or her intentions were. But if I had to guess, I would have to say I was pretty sure that Claude wouldn\u0027t be this frightened of a sweet fairy who wanted to spread goodness and light. And a really nice fairy wouldn\u0027t have put some spell on poor Dermot that made him so discombobulated.\n I said a prayer or two, hoping that would restore my normal good mood, but it didn\u0027t work today. Possibly I wasn\u0027t approaching prayer in the right spirit. Communicating with God isn\u0027t the same as taking a happy pill - far from it.\n I pulled on a dress and sandals and went to Gran\u0027s grave. Having a conversation with her usually reminded me of how levelheaded and wise she\u0027d been. Today all I thought about was her wildly out-of-character indiscretion with a half fairy that had resulted in my dad and his sister, Linda. My grandmother had (maybe) had sex with a half fairy because my grandfather couldn\u0027t make babies. So she\u0027d gotten to carry and birth her children, two of them, and she\u0027d raised them with love.\n And she\u0027d buried both of them.\n As I crouched by the headstone looking down at the grass that was getting thicker on her grave, I wondered if I should draw some meaning from that. You could make a case that Gran had done something she shouldn\u0027t have ... to get something she wasn\u0027t supposed to get ... and after she\u0027d gotten it, she\u0027d lost it in the most painful way imaginable. What could be worse than losing a child? Losing two children.\n Or you could decide that everything that had happened was completely at random, that Gran had done the best she could at the moment she\u0027d had to make a decision, and that her decision simply hadn\u0027t worked out for reasons equally beyond her control. Constant blame, or constant blamelessness.\n There had to be better choices.\n I did the best possible thing for me to do. I put in some earrings and went to church. Easter was over, but the flowers on the Methodist altar were still beautiful. The windows were open because the temperature was pleasant. A few clouds were gathering in the west, but nothing to worry about for the next few hours. I listened to every word of the sermon and I sang along with the hymns, though I kept that down to a whisper because I have a terrible voice. It was good for me; it reminded me of Gran and my childhood and faith and clean dresses and Sunday lunch, usually a roast surrounded by potatoes and carrots that Gran put it in the oven before we left the house. She would have made a pie or a cake, too.\n Church isn\u0027t always easy when you can read the minds around you, and I worked very hard on blocking them out and thinking my own thoughts in an attempt to connect to the part of my upbringing, the part of myself, that was good and kind and intent on trying to become better.\n When the service was over, I talked to Maxine Fortenberry, who was in seventh heaven over Hoyt and Holly\u0027s wedding plans, and I saw Charlsie Tooten toting her grandbaby, and I talked to my insurance agent, Greg Aubert, who had his whole family with him. His daughter turned red when I looked at her, because I knew a few things about her that made her conscience twinge. But I wasn\u0027t judging the girl. We all misbehave from time to time. Some of us get caught, and some of us don\u0027t.\n Sam was in church, too, to my surprise. I\u0027d never seen him there before. As far as I knew, he\u0027d never been to any church in Bon Temps.\n \"I\u0027m glad to see you,\" I said, trying not to sound too startled. \"You been going somewhere else, or is this a new venture?\"\n \"I just felt it was time,\" he said. \"For one thing, I like church. For another thing, a bad time is coming for us two-natured folks, and I want to make sure everyone in Bon Temps knows I\u0027m an okay guy.\"\n \"They\u0027d have to be fools not to know that already,\" I said quietly. \"Good to see you, Sam.\" I moved off because a couple of people were waiting to talk to my boss, and I understood that he was trying to anchor his position in the community.\n I tried not to worry about Eric or anything else the rest of the day. I\u0027d had a text message inviting me to have lunch with Tara and JB, and I was glad to have their company. Tara had gotten Dr. Dinwiddie to check very carefully, and sure enough, he\u0027d found another heartbeat. She and JB were stunned, in a happy way. Tara had fi xed creamed chicken to spoon over biscuits, and she\u0027d made a spinach casserole and a fruit salad. I had a great time at their little house, and JB checked my wrists and said they were almost back to normal. Tara was all excited about the baby shower JB\u0027s aunt was planning on giving them in Clarice, and she assured me I\u0027d get an invitation. We picked a date for her shower in Bon Temps, and she promised she\u0027d register online.\n By the time I got home, I figured I\u0027d better put a load of wash in, and I washed my bath mat, too, and hung it out on the line to dry. While I was outside, I made sure I had my little plastic squirt gun, full of lemon juice, tucked in my pocket. I didn\u0027t want to get caught by surprise again. I just couldn\u0027t figure out what I\u0027d done to deserve having an apparently (judging by Claude\u0027s reaction) hostile fairy tromping around my property.\n My cell phone rang as I trailed gloomily back to the house. \"Hey, Sis,\" Jason said. He was cooking on the grill. I could hear the sizzle. \"Michele and me are cooking out. You want to come? I got plenty of steak.\"\n \"Thanks, but I ate at JB and Tara\u0027s. Give me a rain check on that.\"\n \"Sure thing. I got your message. Tomorrow at eight, right?\"\n \"Yeah. Let\u0027s ride over to Shreveport together.\"\n \"Sure. I\u0027ll pick you up at seven at your place.\"\n \"See you then.\"\n \"Gotta go!\"\n Jason did not like long phone conversations. He\u0027d broken up with girls who wanted to chat while they shaved their legs and painted their nails.\n It was not a great commentary on my life that the prospect of meeting with a bunch of unhappy Weres seemed like a good time - or at least an interesting time.\n Kennedy was bartending when I got to work the next day. She told me that Sam had a final, take-the-checkbook appointment with his accountant, who\u0027d gotten an extension since Sam had been so late turning all the paperwork over.\n Kennedy looked as pretty as she always did. She refused to wear the shorts most of the rest of us wore in warm weather, instead opting for tailored khakis and a fancy belt with her Merlotte\u0027s T-shirt. Kennedy\u0027s makeup and hair were pageant quality. I glanced automatically at Danny Prideaux\u0027s usual barstool. Empty.\n \"Where\u0027s Danny?\" I asked when I went to the bar to get a beer for Catfish Hennessy. He was Jason\u0027s boss, and I half expected to see Jason come in to join him, but Hoyt and a couple of the other roadwork guys sat at Catfish\u0027s table.\n \"He had to work at his other job today,\" Kennedy said, trying to sound offhand. \"I appreciate Sam making sure I\u0027ve got protection while I\u0027m working, Sookie, but I really don\u0027t think there\u0027s going to be any trouble.\"\n The bar door slammed. \"I\u0027m here to protest!\" yelled a woman who looked like anyone\u0027s grandmother. She had a sign, and she hoisted it up. NO COHABITATION WITH ANIMALS, it read, and you could see that she\u0027d written \"cohabitation\" while she looked at a dictionary; each letter was written with such care.\n \"Call the police first,\" I told Kennedy. \"And then Sam. Tell him to get back here no matter what he\u0027s talking about.\" Kennedy nodded and turned to the wall phone.\n Our protester was wearing a blue and white blouse and red pants she\u0027d probably gotten at Bealls or Stage. She had short permed hair dyed a reasonable brown and wore wire-rimmed glasses and a modest wedding ring on her arthritic fingers. Despite this completely average exterior, I could feel her thoughts burning with the fire of a zealot.\n \"Ma\u0027am, you need to take yourself outside. This building is privately owned,\" I said, having no idea if this was a good line to take or not. We\u0027d never had anyone protesting before.\n \"But it\u0027s a public business. Anyone can come inside,\" she said, as if she were the authority.\n Not any more than I was. \"No, not if Sam doesn\u0027t want them in here, and as his representative, I\u0027m telling you to leave.\"\n \"You\u0027re not Sam Merlotte, or his wife. You\u0027re that girl who dates a vampire,\" she said venomously.\n \"I am Sam\u0027s right-hand person at this bar,\" I lied, \"and I\u0027m telling you to get out, or I\u0027ll put you out.\"\n \"You lay one finger on me, and I\u0027ll call the law on you,\" she said, jerking her head.\n Rage flared up in me. I really, really don\u0027t like threats.\n \"Kennedy,\" I said, and in a second she was standing by me. \"I\u0027d say between us we\u0027re strong enough to pick up this lady and take her out of the bar. What do you say?\"\n \"I\u0027m all for it.\" Kennedy stared down at the woman as if she were only waiting for the starting gun to go off. \"And you\u0027re that girl who shot her boyfriend,\" the woman said, beginning to look properly frightened.\n \"I am. I was really mad at him, and at the moment I\u0027m pretty pissed off at you,\" Kennedy said. \"You get your butt out of here and take your little sign with you, and you do it right now.\"\n The older woman\u0027s courage broke, and she scuttled out, remembering at the last moment to keep her head up and her back straight since she was one of God\u0027s soldiers. I got that direct from her head.\n Catfish clapped for Kennedy, and a few others joined in, but mostly the bar patrons sat in stunned silence. Then we heard the chanting from the parking lot, and we all surged to the windows.\n \"Jesus Christ, Shepherd of Judea,\" I breathed. There were at least thirty protesters in the parking lot. Most of them were middle-aged, but I spotted a few teenagers who should have been in school, and I recognized a couple of guys who I knew to be in their early twenties. I sort of recognized most of the crowd. They attended a \"charismatic\" church in Clarice, a church that was growing by leaps and bounds (if construction was any indicator). The last time I\u0027d driven by when I was going to have physical therapy with JB, a new activities building had been going up.\n I wished they were being active there, where they belonged, rather than here. Just as I was about to do something idiotic (like going out in the parking lot), two Bon Temps police cars pulled up, lights flashing. Kevin and Kenya got out. Kevin was skinny and white, and Kenya was round and black. They were both good police officers, and they loved each other dearly ... but unofficially.\n Kevin approached the chanting group with apparent confidence. I couldn\u0027t hear what he said, but they all turned to face him and began talking all at once. He held up his hands to pat the air in a \"back off and get quiet\" gesture, and Kenya circled around to come up behind the group.\n \"Maybe we should go out there?\" Kennedy said.\n Kennedy, I noted, was not in the habit of sitting back and letting things take their course. Nothing wrong with being proactive, but this was not the time to escalate the confrontation in the parking lot, and that was what our presence would do. \"No, I think we need to stay right here,\" I said. \"There\u0027s no point in throwing fuel on the fire.\" I looked around. None of the patrons were eating or drinking. They were all looking out the windows. I thought of requesting that they sit down at their tables, but there was no point in asking them to do something they clearly weren\u0027t going to do, with so much drama going on outside.\n Antoine came out of the kitchen and stood by me. He looked at the scene for a long moment. \"I didn\u0027t have nothing to do with it,\" he said.\n \"I never thought you did,\" I said, surprised. Antoine relaxed, even inside his head. \"This is some crazy church action,\" I said. \"They\u0027re picketing Merlotte\u0027s because Sam is two-natured. But the woman who came in here, she was pretty aware of me and she knew Kennedy\u0027s history, too. I hope this is a one-shot. I\u0027d hate to have to deal with protesters all the time.\"\n \"Sam\u0027ll go broke if this keeps up,\" Kennedy said in a low voice. \"Maybe I should just quit. It\u0027s not going to help Sam that I work here.\"\n \"Kennedy, don\u0027t set yourself up to be a martyr,\" I said. \"They don\u0027t like me, either. Everyone who doesn\u0027t think I\u0027m crazy thinks there\u0027s something supernatural about me. We\u0027d all have to quit, from Sam on down.\"\n She looked at me sharply to make sure I was sincere. She gave me a quick nod. Then she looked out the window again and said, \"Uh-oh.\" Danny Prideaux had pulled up in his 1991 Chrysler LeBaron, a machine he found only slightly less fascinating than he found Kennedy Keyes.\n Danny had parked right at the edge of the crowd, and he hopped out and began to hurry toward the bar. I just knew he was coming to check on Kennedy. Either they\u0027d had a police band radio on at the home builders\u0027 supply place or Danny had heard the news from a customer. The jungle drums beat fast and furious in Bon Temps. Danny was wearing a gray tank top and jeans and boots, and his broad olive shoulders were gleaming with sweat.\n As he strode toward the door, I said, \"I think my mouth is watering.\" Kennedy put her hand over her mouth to stifle a yip of laughter.\n \"Yeah, he looks pretty good,\" she said, trying to sound offhand. We both laughed.\n But then disaster struck. One of the protesters, angry at being shooed away from Merlotte\u0027s, brought his sign down on the hood of the LeBaron. At the sound Danny turned around. He froze for a second, and then he was heading at top speed toward the sinner who\u0027d marred the paint job on his car.\n \"Oh, no,\" Kennedy said and hurtled out of the bar as if she\u0027d been fired from a slingshot. \"Danny!\" she yelled. \"Danny! You stop!\"\n Danny hesitated, turning his head just a fraction to see who was calling him. With a leap that would have done a kangaroo proud, Kennedy was beside him and wrapping her arms around him. He made an impatient movement, as if to shake her off, and then it seemed to dawn on him that Kennedy, whom he\u0027d spent hours admiring, was embracing him. He stood stiffly, his arms at his side, apparently afraid to move.\n I couldn\u0027t tell what Kennedy was saying to him, but Danny looked down at her face, completely focused on her. One of the demonstrators had forgotten herself enough to get an \"Awww\" expression on her face, but she snapped out of her lapse into humanity and brandished her sign again.\n \"Animals go! People stay! We want Congress to show the way!\" one of the older demonstrators, a man with a lot of white hair, shouted as I opened the door and stepped out.\n \"Kevin, get them out of here!\" I called. Kevin, whose thin, pale face was creased into unhappy lines, was trying to shepherd the little crowd out of the parking lot.\n \"Mr. Barlowe,\" Kevin said to the white-haired man, \"what you\u0027re doing is illegal, and I could put you in jail. I really don\u0027t want to have to do that.\"\n \"We\u0027re willing to be arrested for our beliefs,\" the man said. \"Isn\u0027t that so, you-all?\"\n Some of the church members didn\u0027t look entirely certain of that.\n \"Maybe you are,\" Kenya said, \"but we got Jane Bodehouse in one of the cells now. She\u0027s coming off a bender, and she\u0027s throwing up about every five minutes. Believe me, people, you do not want to be in there with Jane.\"\n The woman who\u0027d originally come into Merlotte\u0027s turned a little green.\n \"This is private property,\" Kevin said. \"You cannot demonstrate here. If you don\u0027t clear this parking lot in three minutes, all of you are under arrest.\"\n It was more like five minutes, but the parking lot was clear of demonstrators when Sam joined us in the parking lot to thank Kevin and Kenya. Since I hadn\u0027t seen his truck drive up, his appearance was quite a surprise.\n \"When did you get back?\" I asked.\n \"Less than ten minutes ago,\" he said. \"I knew if I showed myself, they\u0027d just get pumped up again, so I parked on School Street and walked through the back way.\"\n \"Smart,\" I said. The lunch crowd was leaving Merlotte\u0027s, and the incident was already on the track to becoming a local legend. Only one or two of the patrons seemed upset; the rest regarded the demonstration as good entertainment. Catfish Hennessy clapped Sam on the shoulder as he went by, and he wasn\u0027t the only one who made an extra effort to show support. I wondered how long the tolerant attitude would last. If the picketers kept it up, a lot of people might decide that coming here simply wasn\u0027t worth the trouble.\n I didn\u0027t need to say any of this out loud. It was written on Sam\u0027s face. \"Hey,\" I said, slinging an arm around his shoulders. \"They\u0027ll go away. You know what you should do? You should call the pastor of that church. They\u0027re all from Holy Word Tabernacle in Clarice. You should tell him that you want to come talk to the church. Show them you\u0027re a person just like everyone else. I bet that would work.\"\n Then I realized how stiff his shoulders were. Sam was rigid with anger. \"I should not have to tell anyone anything,\" he said. \"I\u0027m a citizen of this country. My father was in the army. I was in the army. I pay my share of taxes. And I\u0027m not a person like everyone else. I\u0027m a shifter. And they need to just put that on their plates and eat it.\" He whirled to go back into his bar.\n I flinched, though I knew his anger wasn\u0027t directed at me. As I watched Sam stalk away, I reminded myself that none of this was about me. But I couldn\u0027t help but feel I had a stake in the outcome of this new development. Not only did I work at Merlotte\u0027s, but the woman who\u0027d come in initially had named me as part of the problem.\n Furthermore, I still thought approaching the church in person was a good idea. It was reasonable and civil.\n Sam wasn\u0027t in a reasonable and civil mood, and I could understand that. I just didn\u0027t know where he was going to put his anger.\n A newspaper reporter came in an hour later and interviewed all of us about \"the incident,\" as he called it. Errol Clayton was a guy in his forties who wrote about half the stories in the little Bon Temps paper. He didn\u0027t own it, but he managed it on a shoestring budget. I had no issue with the paper, but of course lots of folks made fun of it. The Bon Temps Bugle was frequently called the Bon Temps Bungle.\n While Errol was waiting for Sam to finish a phone call, I said, \"You want a drink, Mr. Clayton?\"\n \"I\u0027d sure appreciate some iced tea, Sookie,\" he said. \"How\u0027s that brother of yours?\"\n \"He\u0027s doing well.\"\n \"Getting over the death of his wife?\"\n \"I think he\u0027s come to terms with it,\" I said, which covered all sorts of ground. \"That was a terrible thing.\"\n \"Yes, very bad. And it was right here in this parking lot,\" Errol Clayton said, as if I might have forgotten. \"And right here, in this parking lot, was where the body of Lafayette Reynold was found.\"\n \"That\u0027s true, too. But of course, none of that was Sam\u0027s fault, or had anything to do with him.\"\n \"Never arrested anyone for Crystal\u0027s death that I recall.\"\n I reared back to give Errol Clayton a hard stare. \"Mr. Clayton, if you\u0027ve come here to make trouble, you can just leave now. We need things to be better, not worse. Sam is a good man. He goes to the Rotary, he puts an ad in the high school yearbook, he sponsors a baseball team at the Boys and Girls Club every spring, and he helps with the Fourth of July fireworks. Plus, he\u0027s a great boss, a veteran, and a tax-paying citizen.\"\n \"Merlotte, you got you a fan club,\" Errol Clayton said to Sam, who\u0027d come to stand right behind me.\n \"I\u0027ve got a friend,\" Sam said quietly. \"I\u0027m lucky enough to have a lot of friends and a good business. I sure would hate to see that ruined.\" I heard an apology in his voice, and I felt his hand pat my shoulder. Feeling much better, I slipped away to do my job, leaving Sam to talk to the newspaperman.\n I didn\u0027t get a chance to talk to my boss again before I left to go home. I had to stop at the store because I needed a couple of things - Claude had made inroads into my potato chip stash and my cereal, too - and I wasn\u0027t just imagining that the store was full of people who were busy talking about what had happened at lunchtime at Merlotte\u0027s. There was silence every time I came around a corner, but of course that didn\u0027t make any difference to me. I could tell what people were thinking.\n Most of them didn\u0027t share the beliefs of the demonstrators. But the mere fact of the incident had set some of the previously indifferent townspeople to thinking about the issue of the two-natured, and about the legislation that proposed to take away some of their rights.\n And some of them were all for it. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-in-the-family-sookie-stackhouse-10/page-13.html","bookId":2200,"book":{"id":2200,"title":"Dead in the Family (Sookie Stackhouse #10)","description":"Storyline: \n Dead in the Family (Sookie Stackhouse #10) \n It\u0027s all about family ... \n Sookie Stackhouse is dealing with a whole host of family problems, ranging from her own kin (a non-human fairy and a telepathic second cousin) demanding a place in her life, to her lover Eric\u0027s vampire sire, an ancient being who arrives with Eric\u0027s \u0027brother\u0027 in tow at a most inopportune moment.
