{"id":101493,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"Pam yanked Bruno\u0027s body off me and rolled him all the way down into the water coursing through the ditch. She helped me up. \"Where were you?\" I croaked. \"Disposing of Corinna,\" literal-minded Pam said. She pointed to the body lying by the white car. Fortunately, the corpse was on the side of the car concealed from the view of the rare passerby. In the poor light it was hard to be sure, but I believed Corinna was already beginning to flake away. I\u0027d never seen a dead vampire in the rain before. \"I thought Bruno was such a great fighter. How come you didn\u0027t take him on?\" \"I gave you the knife,\" Pam said, giving a good imitation of surprise. \"He didn\u0027t have a knife.\" \"Right.\" I coughed and, boy, did that hurt my throat. \"So what do we do now?\" \"We\u0027re getting out of here,\" Pam said. \"We\u0027re going to hope that no one noticed my car. I think only three cars passed since we pulled over. With the rain and poor visibility, if the drivers were human, we have a very good chance that none of them will remember seeing us.\" By then we were back in Pam\u0027s car. \"Wouldn\u0027t it be better if we moved the Lexus?\" I said, wheezing out the words. \"What a good idea,\" Pam said, patting me on the head. \"Do you think you can drive it?\" \"Where to?\" Pam thought for a moment, which was good, because I needed the recovery time. I was soaked through and shivering, and I felt awful. \"Won\u0027t Victor know what\u0027s happened?\" I asked. I couldn\u0027t seem to stop asking questions. \"Maybe. He wasn\u0027t brave enough to do this himself, so he has to take the consequences. He\u0027s lost his two best people, and he has nothing to show for it.\" Pam was enjoying the hell out of that. \"I think we get out of here right now. Before some more of his people come to check, or whatever.\" I sure wasn\u0027t up for fighting again. \"It\u0027s you who keeps asking questions. I think Eric will be here soon; I\u0027d better call him to tell him to stay away,\" Pam said. She looked faintly worried. \"Why?\" I would have loved to have Eric appear to take charge of this situation, frankly. \"If someone is watching his house, and he leaps into his car and drives in this direction to come rescue you, it\u0027ll be a pretty clear indication that we\u0027re responsible for what happened to Bruno and Corinna,\" Pam said, clearly exasperated. \"Use your brain, Sookie!\" \"My brain is all soggy,\" I said, and if I sounded a little testy, I don\u0027t think that\u0027s any big, amazing thing. But Pam was already hitting a speed-dial number on her cell. I could hear Eric yelling when he answered the phone. Pam said, \"Shut up and I\u0027ll explain. Of course, she lives.\" There was silence. Pam summed up the situation in a few pithy phrases, and she concluded with, \"Go somewhere it\u0027s reasonable to be going in a hurry. Back to the bar in answer to some crisis. To the all-night dry cleaners to pick up your suits. To the store to pick up some TrueBlood. Don\u0027t lead them here.\" After a squawk or two, Eric apparently saw the sense in what Pam was saying. I couldn\u0027t hear his voice clearly, though he was still talking to her. \"Her throat will be bruised,\" Pam said impatiently. \"Yes, she killed Bruno herself. All right, I\u0027ll tell her.\" Pam turned to me. \"He\u0027s proud of you,\" she said with some disgust. \"Pam gave me the knife,\" I croaked. I knew he could hear me. \"But it was Sookie\u0027s idea to move the car,\" Pam said, with the air of someone who\u0027s going to be fair if it kills her. \"I\u0027m trying to think of where to put it. The truck stops will have security cameras. I think we\u0027ll leave it on the shoulder well past the Bon Temps exit.\" That\u0027s what we did. Pam had some towels in her trunk, and I put them down on the seat of Bruno\u0027s car. Pam poked around in his ashes to retrieve the Lexus key, and after looking over the instrument panel, I figured I could drive it. I followed Pam for forty minutes, staring longingly at the Bon Temps sign as we sped past it. I pulled over to the shoulder right after Pam did. Following Pam\u0027s instructions, I left the key in the car, wiped off the steering wheel with the towels (which were damp from their contact with me), and then scuttled to Pam\u0027s car and climbed in. It was still raining, by the way. Then we had to return to my house. By then I was aching in every joint and a little sick to my stomach. Finally, finally, we pulled up to my back door. To my amazement, Pam leaned over to give me a hug. \"You did very well,\" she said. \"You did what had to be done.\" For once, she didn\u0027t look as if she were secretly laughing at me. \"I hope this all turns out to be worth it,\" I said, sounding as gloomy and exhausted as I felt. \"We\u0027re still alive, so it was worth it,\" Pam said. I couldn\u0027t argue with that, though something within me wanted to. I climbed out of her car and trudged across the dripping backyard. The rain had finally stopped. Claude opened the back door as I reached it. He had opened his mouth to say something, but when he took in my condition, he closed it again. He shut the door behind me, and I heard him lock it. \"I\u0027m going to shower,\" I said, \"and then I\u0027m going to bed. Good night, Claude.\" \"Good night, Sookie,\" he said, very quietly, and then he shut up. I appreciated that more than I could say. When I got into work the next day at eleven, Sam was dusting all the bottles behind the bar. \"Good morning,\" he said, staring at me. \"You look like hell warmed over.\" \"Thanks, Sam. Good to know I\u0027m looking my best.\" Sam turned red. \"Sorry, Sookie. You always look good. I was just thinking ...\" \"About the big circles under my eyes?\" I pulled down the skin of my cheeks, making a hideous face for his benefit. \"I was real late getting in last night.\" I had to kill someone and move his car. \"I had to go over to Shreveport to see Eric.\" \"Business or pleasure?\" And he ducked his head, clearly not believing he\u0027d said that, either. \"I\u0027m sorry, Sookie. My mom would say I got up on the tactless side of the bed today.\" I gave him a half hug. \"Don\u0027t worry. Every day is like that for me. And I have to apologize to you. I\u0027m sorry I\u0027ve been so ignorant about the legal trouble facing shifters and Weres right now.\" It was definitely time for me to look at the big picture. \"You had some good reasons to concentrate on yourself the past few weeks,\" Sam said. \"I don\u0027t know that I could have recovered the way you have. I\u0027m real proud of you.\" I didn\u0027t know what to say. I looked down at the bar, reached for a cloth to polish away a ring. \"If you need me to start a petition or call my state representative, you just say the word,\" I told him. \"No one should make you register anywhere. You\u0027re an American. Born and bred.\" \"That\u0027s the way I look at it. It\u0027s not like I\u0027m any different from the way I\u0027ve always been. The only difference is that now people know about it. How did the pack run go?\" I\u0027d almost forgotten about it. \"They seemed to have a good time, far as I can tell,\" I said cautiously. \"I met Annabelle and the new guy, Basim. Why is Alcide beefing up the ranks? Have you heard anything about what\u0027s been happening in the Long Tooth pack?\" \"Well, I told you I\u0027d been dating one of them,\" he said, looking away at the bottles behind the bar as if he were trying to spot one that was still dusty. If this conversation continued in the same vein, the whole bar would be spanking clean. \"Who would that be?\" Since this was the second time he\u0027d mentioned it, I figured it was okay for me to ask. His fascination with the bottles was transferred to the cash register. \"Ah, Jannalynn. Jannalynn Hopper.\" \"Oh,\" I said, in a neutral way. I was trying to give myself a little time to make my face bland and receptive. \"She was there the night we fought the pack that was trying to take over. She, ah ... took care of the wounded enemies.\" That was an extreme euphemism. She\u0027d cracked their skulls with her clenched fists. Trying to prove that it wasn\u0027t National Tactless Day at my house, I said, \"Oh, yes. The, ah, very slim girl. The young one.\" \"She\u0027s not as young as she looks,\" Sam said, bypassing the obvious fact that her age was not the first issue one could have with Jannalynn. \"Okeydokey. How old is she?\" \"Twenty. One.\" \"Oh, well, she\u0027s quite a girl,\" I said solemnly. I forced a smile to my lips. \"Seriously, Sam, I\u0027m not judging your choice.\" Not much. \"Jannalynn\u0027s really, really ... She\u0027s dynamic.\" \"Thanks,\" he said, his face clearing. \"She gave me a call after we fought in the pack war. She\u0027s into lions.\" Sam had changed into a lion that night, the better to fight. He\u0027d made a magnificent king of beasts. \"So, how long have you two been dating?\" \"We\u0027ve been talking for a while, but we went out for the first time maybe three weeks ago.\" \"Well, that\u0027s great,\" I said. I made myself relax and smile more naturally. \"You sure you don\u0027t need a note from her mom?\" Sam threw the dust cloth at me. I grabbed it and threw it back. \"Can you two quit playing? I got to talk to Sam,\" Tanya said. She\u0027d come in without my hearing her. She\u0027s never going to be my best friend, but she\u0027s a good worker and she\u0027s willing to come in two evenings a week after she gets off her day job at Norcross. \"You want me to leave?\" I asked. \"No, that\u0027s okay.\" \"Sorry, Tanya. What do you need?\" Sam asked, smiling. \"I need you to change my name on my paychecks,\" Tanya said. \"You changed your name?\" I must have been extra slow that day. But Sam would have said it if I hadn\u0027t; he looked just as blank. \"Yeah, me and Calvin went to a courthouse across the state line in Arkansas and got married,\" she said. \"I\u0027m Tanya Norris now.\" Sam and I both stared at Tanya in a moment of silent astonishment. \"Congratulations!\" I said heartily. \"I know you\u0027ll be real happy.\" I wasn\u0027t so sure about Calvin being happy, but at least I managed to say something nice. Sam chimed in, too, with all the right things. Tanya showed us her wedding ring, a broad gold band, and after going into the kitchen to show it to Antoine and D\u0027Eriq, she left as abruptly as she\u0027d arrived to drive back to work at Norcross. She\u0027d mentioned they\u0027d registered at Target and Wal-Mart for the few things they needed, so Sam dashed into his office and picked out a wall clock to give them from all the Merlotte\u0027s employees. He put a jar out by the bar for our contributions, and I dropped in a ten. By that time, people were coming in for lunch, and I had to get busy. \"I never did get around to asking you some questions,\" I said to Sam. \"Maybe before I leave work?\" \"Sure, Sook,\" he said, and began filling glasses with iced tea. It was a warm day. After I\u0027d served drinks and food for about an hour, I was surprised to see Claude coming through the door. Even in rumpled clothes he\u0027d obviously picked up off the floor to pull on, he looked breathtakingly gorgeous. He\u0027d pulled his hair back into a messy ponytail ... and it didn\u0027t detract. It was almost enough to make you hate him, really. Claude slouched over to me as if he were in Merlotte\u0027s every day ... and as if his kind and tactful moment last night had never been. \"The water heater\u0027s not working,\" he said. \"Hi, Claude. Good to see you,\" I said. \"Did you sleep well? I\u0027m so glad. I slept well, too. I guess you better do something about the water heater, huh? If you want to shower and wash your clothes. Remember me asking you to help me out by handling some things I can\u0027t? You could call Hank Clearwater. He\u0027s come out to the house before.\" \"I can go have a look,\" a voice said. I turned to see Terry Bellefleur standing behind me. Terry is a Vietnam War vet, and he\u0027s got some awful scars - both the kind you can see and the kind you can\u0027t. He\u0027d been very young when he\u0027d gone to war. He\u0027d been very old when he returned. His auburn hair was graying, but it was still thick, and long enough to braid. I\u0027d always gotten along real well with Terry, who could do just about anything around the yard or in the house, by way of repairs. \"I would sure appreciate it,\" I said. \"But I don\u0027t want to take advantage, Terry.\" He\u0027d always been kind to me. He\u0027d cleared away the debris of my burned kitchen so the builders could start working on the new one, and I\u0027d had to insist he take a fair wage for it. \"No problem,\" he muttered, his eyes on his old work boots. Terry survived on a monthly government check and on several odd jobs. For example, he came into Merlotte\u0027s either very late at night or early in the morning to clean the tables and the bathrooms, and to mop the floors. He always said keeping busy kept him fit, and it was true that Terry was still built. \"I\u0027m Claude Crane, Sookie\u0027s cousin.\" Claude held out his hand to Terry. Terry muttered his own name and took Claude\u0027s hand. His eyes came up to meet Claude\u0027s. Terry\u0027s eyes were unexpectedly beautiful, a rich golden brown and heavily lashed. I\u0027d never noticed before. I realized I\u0027d never thought about Terry as a man before. After the handshake, Terry looked startled. When he was faced with something out of his normal path, usually Terry reacted badly; the only question was of degree. But at the moment, Terry seemed more puzzled than frightened or angry. \"Ah, did you want me to come look at it now?\" Terry asked. \"I have a couple of hours free.\" \"That would be wonderful,\" Claude said. \"I want my shower, and I want a hot one.\" He smiled at Terry. \"Dude, I\u0027m not gay,\" Terry said, and the expression on Claude\u0027s face was priceless. I\u0027d never seen Claude nonplussed before. \"Thanks, Terry, I\u0027d sure appreciate it,\" I said briskly. \"Claude\u0027s got a key, and he\u0027ll let you in. If you have to buy some parts, just give me the receipts. You know I\u0027m good for it.\" I might have to transfer some money from my savings to my checking, but I still had what I thought of as my \"vampire money\" safely stashed at the bank. And Mr. Cataliades would be sending me poor Claudine\u0027s money, too. Something relaxed inside me every time I thought about that bit of money. I\u0027d been balanced on the fine edge of poverty so many times that I was used to it, and the knowledge of that money I\u0027d be able to sock in the bank was a huge relief to me. Terry nodded and then went out the back door to get his pickup. I speared Claude with a scowl. \"That man is very fragile,\" I said. \"He had a bad war. Just remember that.\" Claude\u0027s face was slightly flushed. \"I\u0027ll remember,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve been in wars myself.\" He gave me another quick graze on the cheek, to show me he\u0027d recovered from the blow to his pride. I could feel the envy of every woman in the bar beating against me. \"I\u0027ll be gone to Monroe by the time you get home, I suppose. Thanks, Cousin.\" Sam came to stand beside me as Claude went out the door. \"Elvis has left the building,\" he said dryly. \"No, I haven\u0027t seen him in a while,\" I said, definitely on auto-mouth. Then I shook myself. \"Sorry, Sam. Claude\u0027s one of a kind, isn\u0027t he?\" \"I haven\u0027t seen Claudine in a while. She\u0027s a lot of fun,\" Sam said. \"Claude seems to be ... more typical of the general run of fairies.\" There was a question in his voice. \"We won\u0027t be seeing Claudine anymore,\" I said. \"As far as I know, we won\u0027t be seeing any fairies but Claude. The doors are shut. However that works. Though I understand there\u0027s still one or two lurking around my house.\" \"There\u0027s a lot you haven\u0027t told me,\" he said. \"We need to catch up,\" I agreed. \"What about this evening? After you get off? Terry\u0027s supposed to come back and do some repairs that have piled up around here, but Kennedy is scheduled to take the bar.\" Sam looked a little worried. \"I hope Claude doesn\u0027t make another pass at Terry. Claude\u0027s ego is as big as a barn, and Terry\u0027s so ... You never know how he\u0027s going to take stuff.\" \"Terry\u0027s a grown man,\" I reminded Sam. Of course, I was trying to reassure myself. \"They both are.\" \"Claude isn\u0027t a man at all,\" Sam said. \"Though he\u0027s a male.\" It was a huge relief when I noticed Terry\u0027d returned an hour later. He seemed absolutely normal, not flustered, angry, or anything else. I had always tried to keep out of Terry\u0027s head, because it could be a very frightening place. Terry did well as long as he kept his focus on one thing at a time. He thought about his dogs a lot. He\u0027d kept one of the puppies from his bitch\u0027s last litter, and he was training the youngster. (In fact, if ever a dog was taught to read, Terry would be the man who\u0027d done it.) After he\u0027d worked on a loose doorknob in Sam\u0027s office, Terry sat at one of my tables and ordered a salad and some sweet tea. After I took his order, Terry silently handed me a receipt. He\u0027d had to get a new element for the water heater. \"It\u0027s all fi xed now,\" he said. \"Your cousin was able to get his hot shower.\" \"Thanks, Terry,\" I said. \"I\u0027m going to give you something for your time and labor.\" \"Not a problem,\" Terry said. \"Your cousin took care of that.\" He turned his attention to his magazine. He\u0027d brought a copy of Louisiana Hunting and Fishing to read while he waited for his food. I wrote Terry a check for the element and gave it to him when I brought his food. He nodded and slipped it in his pocket. Since Terry\u0027s schedule meant he wasn\u0027t always available to fill in, Sam had hired another bartender so he could have some regular evenings off. The new bartender, who\u0027d been at work for a couple of weeks, was really pretty in a supersized way. Kennedy Keyes was five-eleven, easy; taller than Sam, for sure. She had the kind of good looks you associate with traditional beauty queens: shoulder-length chestnut hair with discreet blond highlights, wide brown eyes, a white and even smile that was an orthodontist\u0027s wet dream. Her skin was perfect, her back straight, and she\u0027d graduated from Southern Arkansas University with a degree in psychology. She\u0027d also done time. Sam had asked her if she wanted a job when she\u0027d drifted in for lunch the day after she\u0027d gotten out of jail. She hadn\u0027t even asked what she\u0027d be doing before she\u0027d said yes. He\u0027d given her a basic bartender\u0027s guide, and she\u0027d studied every spare moment until she\u0027d mastered an amazing number of drinks. \"Sookie!\" she said, as if we\u0027d been best friends since childhood. That was Kennedy\u0027s way. \"How you doing?\" \"Good, thank you. Yourself?\" \"Happy as a clam.\" She bent to check the number of sodas in the glass-fronted refrigerator behind the bar. \"We need us some A\u0026W,\" she said. \"Coming right up.\" I got the keys from Sam, then went back to the stockroom to find a case of root beer. I got two six-packs. \"I didn\u0027t mean you to get that. I coulda gotten them!\" Kennedy smiled at me. Her smile was kind of perpetual. \"I appreciate it.\" \"No problem.\" \"Do I look any smaller, Sookie?\" she said hopefully. She half turned to show me her butt and looked at me over her own shoulder. Kennedy\u0027s issue didn\u0027t seem to be that she had been in jail, but that she had put on weight in jail. The food had been crappy, she\u0027d told me, and it had been high on the carbohydrate count. \"But I\u0027m an emotional eater,\" she\u0027d said, as if that were a terrible thing. \"And I was real emotional in jail.\" Ever since she\u0027d gotten back to Bon Temps, she\u0027d been anxious to return to her beauty queen measurements. She was still beautiful. There was just more of her to look good. \"You\u0027re gorgeous, as always,\" I said. I looked around for Danny Prideaux. Sam had asked Danny to come in when Kennedy was working at night. This arrangement was supposed to last for a month, until Sam was sure people wouldn\u0027t take advantage of Kennedy. \"You know,\" she said, interpreting my glance, \"I can handle myself.\" Everyone in Bon Temps knew that Kennedy could handle herself, and that was the problem. Her reputation might constitute a challenge to certain men (certain men who were assholes). \"I know you can,\" I said mildly. Danny Prideaux was insurance. And there he came through the door. He was taller than Kennedy by a couple of inches, and he was of some racial mixture that I hadn\u0027t figured out. Danny had deep olive skin, short brown hair, and a broad face. He\u0027d been out of the army for a month, and he hadn\u0027t yet settled into a career of any sort. He worked part-time at the home builders\u0027 supply store. He was willing enough to be a bouncer for a few nights a week, especially since he got to look at Kennedy the whole time. Sam drifted out of his office to say good night and brief Kennedy on a customer whose check had bounced, and then he and I went out the back door together. \"Let\u0027s go to Crawdad Diner,\" he suggested. That sounded good to me. It was an old restaurant just off the square around the courthouse. Like all the businesses in the area around the square, the oldest part of Bon Temps, the diner had a history. The original owners had been Perdita and Crawdad Jones, who\u0027d opened the restaurant in the forties. When Perdita had retired, she\u0027d sold the business to Charlsie Tooten\u0027s husband, Ralph, who\u0027d quit his job at the chicken processing plant to take over. Their deal was that Perdita would give Ralph all her recipes if he\u0027d agree to keep the name Crawdad Diner. When Ralph\u0027s arthritis had forced him to retire, he\u0027d sold Crawdad Diner to Pinkie Arnett with the same condition. So generations of Bon Temps diners were ensured of getting the best bread pudding in the state, and the heirs of Perdita and Crawdad Jones were able to point with pride. I told Sam this bit of local history after we\u0027d ordered country-fried steak with green beans and rice. \"Thank God Pinkie got the bread pudding recipe, and when the green tomatoes are in season, I want to come in every other night to have \u0027em fried,\" Sam said. \"How\u0027s living with your cousin?\" He squeezed his lemon slice into his tea. \"I hardly know yet. He just moved in some stuff, and we haven\u0027t had a lot of overlap.\" \"Have you seen him strip?\" Sam laughed. \"I mean, professionally? I sure couldn\u0027t do that on a stage with people watching.\" Physically, there sure wouldn\u0027t be anything stopping him. I\u0027d seen Sam naked when he changed from a shifter form into human. Yum. \"No, I always planned on going with Amelia, but since she went back to New Orleans I haven\u0027t been in a strip-club kind of mood. You should ask Claude for a job on your nights off,\" I said, grinning. \"Oh, sure,\" he said sarcastically, but he looked pleased. We talked about Amelia\u0027s departure for a while, and then I asked Sam about his family in Texas. \"My mom\u0027s divorce came through,\" he said. \"Of course, my stepdad\u0027s been in jail since he shot her, so she hasn\u0027t seen him in months. At this point, I\u0027m guessing the main difference to her is going to be financial. She\u0027s getting my dad\u0027s military pension, but she doesn\u0027t know if her job at the school will be waiting for her or not when the summer\u0027s over. They hired a substitute for the rest of the school year after she got shot, and they\u0027re waffling over having Mom back.\" Before she\u0027d gotten shot, Sam\u0027s mom had been the receptionist/ secretary at an elementary school. Not everyone was calm about having a woman who turned into an animal working in the same office as them, though Sam\u0027s mom was the same woman she\u0027d been before. I was baffled by this attitude. The waitress brought our plates and a basket of rolls. I sighed with anticipated pleasure. This was much nicer than cooking for myself. \"Any news on Craig\u0027s wedding?\" I asked, when I could yank myself away from my country-fried steak. \"They finished couples counseling,\" he said with a shrug. \"Now her parents want them to have genetics counseling, whatever that is.\" \"That\u0027s nuts.\" \"Some people just think anything different is bad,\" Sam said as he buttered his second roll. \"And it\u0027s not like Craig could change.\" As the firstborn of a pure shifter couple, only Sam felt the call of the moon. \"I\u0027m sorry.\" I shook my head. \"I know the situation\u0027s hard on everyone in your family.\" He nodded. \"My sister Mindy\u0027s gotten over it pretty well. She let me play with the kids the last time I saw them, and I\u0027m going to try to get over to Texas for the Fourth of July. Her town has a big fireworks display, and the whole family goes. I think I\u0027d enjoy it.\" I smiled. They were lucky to have Sam in their family - that was what I thought. \"Your sister must be pretty smart,\" I said. I took a big bite of country-fried steak with milk gravy. It was blissful. He laughed. \"Listen, while we\u0027re talking family,\" he said. \"You ready to tell me how you\u0027re really doing? You told me about your great-grandfather and what happened. How are your injuries? I don\u0027t want to sound like I expect you to tell me everything that goes on in your life. But you know I care.\" I did a little hesitating myself. But it felt right to tell Sam, so I tried to give him a nutshell account of the past week. \"And JB has been helping me with some physical therapy,\" I added. \"You\u0027re walking like nothing happened, unless you get tired,\" he observed. \"There\u0027s a couple of bad patches on my left upper thigh where the flesh actually ... Okay, not going there.\" I looked down at my napkin for a minute or two. \"It grew back. Mostly. There\u0027s a kind of dimple. I have a few scars, but they\u0027re not terrible. Eric doesn\u0027t seem to mind.\" In fact, he had a scar or two from his human life, though they hardly showed against the whiteness of his skin. \"Are you, ah, coping okay with it?\" \"I have nightmares sometimes,\" I confessed. \"And I have some panic moments. But let\u0027s not talk about it anymore.\" I smiled at him, my brightest smile. \"Look at us after all these years, Sam. I\u0027m living with a fairy, I\u0027ve got a vampire boyfriend, you\u0027re dating a werewolf who cracks skulls. Would we ever have thought we\u0027d say this, the first day I came to work at Merlotte\u0027s?\" Sam leaned forward and briefly put his hand over mine, and just then Pinkie herself came by the table to ask us how we\u0027d liked the food. I pointed to my nearly empty plate. \"I think you can tell we did,\" I said, smiling at her. She grinned back. Pinkie was a big woman who clearly enjoyed her own cooking. Some new customers came in, and she went off to seat them. Sam took his hand back and began working on his food again. \"I wish ...\" Sam began, and then he closed his mouth. He ran a hand through his red gold hair. Since he\u0027d had it trimmed so short, it had looked tamer than usual until he tousled it. He laid his fork down, and I noticed he\u0027d managed to dispose of almost all his food, too. \"What do you wish?\" I asked. Most people, I\u0027d be scared to ask them to complete that sentence. But Sam and I had been friends for years. \"I wish that you would find happiness with someone else,\" he said. \"I know, I know. It\u0027s none of my business. Eric does seem to really care about you, and you deserve that.\" \"He does,\" I said. \"He\u0027s what I\u0027ve got, and I\u0027d be real ungrateful if I weren\u0027t happy with that. We love each other.\" I shrugged, in a self-deprecating way. I was uncomfortable with the turn of the conversation. Sam nodded, though a wry twist to the corner of his mouth told me, without even hearing his thoughts, that Sam didn\u0027t think Eric was such an object of worth. I was glad I couldn\u0027t hear all his thoughts clearly. I thought Jannalynn was equally inappropriate for Sam. He didn\u0027t need a ferocious, anything-for-the-packmaster kind of woman. He needed to be with someone who thought he was the greatest man around. But I didn\u0027t say anything. You can\u0027t say I\u0027m not tactful. It was dreadfully tempting to tell Sam what had happened the night before. But I just couldn\u0027t. I didn\u0027t want to involve Sam in vampire shit any more than he already was, which was very little. No one needed stuff like that. Of course, I\u0027d worried all day about the fallout from those events. My cell phone rang while Sam was paying his half of the bill. I glanced at it. Pam was calling. My heart leaped into my throat. I stepped outside the diner. \"What\u0027s up?\" I asked, sounding just as anxious as I really was. \"Hello to you, too.\" \"Pam, what happened?\" I wasn\u0027t in the mood for playfulness. \"Bruno and Corinna didn\u0027t show up in New Orleans for work today,\" Pam said solemnly. \"Victor didn\u0027t call here, because, of course, there was no good reason for them to come up here.\" \"Did they find the car?\" \"Not yet. I\u0027m sure the highway-patrol officers have put a sticker on it today, asking the owners to come and remove it. That\u0027s what they do, I\u0027ve observed.\" \"Yes. That\u0027s what they do.\" \"No bodies will appear. Especially since after the downpour of last night, there won\u0027t be a trace.\" Pam sounded smug about that. \"No blame can attach to us.\" I stood there, phone to my ear, on an empty sidewalk in my little town, the streetlight only a few feet away. I\u0027d seldom felt more alone. \"I wish it had been Victor,\" I said, from the bottom of my heart. \"You want to kill someone else?\" Pam sounded mildly surprised. \"No, I want it to be over. I want everything to be okay. I don\u0027t want any more killing at all.\" Sam came out of the restaurant behind me and heard the distress in my voice. I felt his hand on my shoulder. \"I have to go, Pam. Keep me posted.\" I shut the phone and turned to face Sam. He was looking troubled, and the light streaming from overhead cast deep shadows on his face. \"You\u0027re in trouble,\" he said. I could only keep silent. \"I know you can\u0027t talk about it, but if you ever feel like you have to, you know where I am,\" he said. \"You, too,\" I said, because I figured with a girlfriend like Jannalynn, Sam might be in almost as bad a position as I was.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-in-the-family-sookie-stackhouse-10/page-5.html","bookId":2200,"book":{"id":2200,"title":"Dead in the Family (Sookie Stackhouse #10)","description":"Storyline: Dead in the Family (Sookie Stackhouse #10) It\u0027s all about family ...

And Sookie\u0027s tracking down a distant relation of her ailing neighbour (and ex), Vampire Bill Compton. In addition to the multitude of family issues complicating her life, the werewolf pack of Shreveport has asked Sookie for a special favour, and since Sookie is an obliging young woman, she agrees.
