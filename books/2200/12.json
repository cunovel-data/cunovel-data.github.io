{"id":101499,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"He could have slain me about sixty times in the seconds I stood there. Despite the fact that he didn\u0027t, I still didn\u0027t want to take my eyes off him.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be afraid,\" Dermot said, rising with a grace that Jason could never have matched. He moved like his joints were machine made and well oiled.\\n\\n I said through numb lips, \"Can\u0027t help it.\"\\n\\n \"I want to explain,\" he said as he drew nearer.\\n\\n \"Explain?\"\\n\\n \"I wanted to get closer to both of you,\" he said. He was well into my personal space by then. His eyes were blue like Jason\u0027s, candid like Jason\u0027s, and really, seriously, crazy. Not like Jason\u0027s. \"I was confused.\"\\n\\n \"About what?\" I wanted to keep the conversation going, I surely did, because I didn\u0027t know what would happen when it came to a halt.\\n\\n \"About where my loyalties lay,\" he said, bowing his head as gracefully as a swan.\\n\\n \"Sure. Tell me about that.\" Oh, if only I had my squirt gun, loaded with lemon juice, in my purse! But I\u0027d promised Eric I\u0027d put it on my nightstand when Claude had come to live with me, so that was where it lay. And the iron trowel was where it was supposed to be, in the toolshed.\\n\\n \"I will,\" he said, standing close enough that I could smell him. He smelled great. Fairies always do. \"I know you met my father, Niall.\"\\n\\n I nodded, a very small movement. \"Yes,\" I said, to make sure.\\n\\n \"Did you love him?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said without hesitation. \"I did. I do.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s easy to love; he\u0027s charming,\" Dermot said. \"My mother, Einin, was beautiful, too. Not a fairy kind of beautiful, like Niall, but she was human-beautiful.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what Niall told me,\" I said. I was picking my way through a conversational minefield.\\n\\n \"Did he tell you the water fairies murdered my twin?\"\\n\\n \"Did Niall tell me your brother was murdered? No, but I heard.\"\\n\\n \"I saw parts of Fintan\u0027s body. Neave and Lochlan had torn him limb from limb.\"\\n\\n \"They helped drown my parents, too,\" I said, holding my breath. What would he say?\\n\\n \"I ...\" He struggled to speak, his face desperate. \"But I wasn\u0027t there. I ... Niall ...\" It was terrible to watch Dermot struggle to speak. I shouldn\u0027t have had any mercy for him, since Niall had told me about Dermot\u0027s part in my parents\u0027 deaths. But I really couldn\u0027t endure his pain.\\n\\n \"So how come you ended up siding with Breandan\u0027s forces in the war?\"\\n\\n \"He told me my father had killed my brother,\" Dermot said bleakly. \"And I believed him. I mistrusted my love for Niall. When I remembered my mother\u0027s misery after Niall stopped coming to visit her, I thought Breandan must be right and we weren\u0027t meant to mingle with humans. It never seems to turn out well for them. And I hated what I was, half-human. I was never at home anywhere.\"\\n\\n \"So, are you feeling better now? About being a little bit human?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve come to terms with it. I know my former actions were wrong, and I\u0027m grieved that my father won\u0027t let me into Faery.\" The big blue eyes looked sad. I was too busy trying not to shake to get the full impact.\\n\\n In a breath, out a breath. Calm, calm. \"So now you\u0027re thinking Jason and I are okay? You don\u0027t want to hurt us anymore?\"\\n\\n He put his arms around me. This was \"hug Sookie\" season, and no one had told me ahead of time. Fairies were very touchy-feely, and personal space didn\u0027t mean anything to them. I would have liked to tell my great-uncle to back off. But I didn\u0027t dare. I didn\u0027t need to read Dermot\u0027s mind to understand that almost anything could set him off, so delicate was his mental balance. I had to stiffen all my resolution to maintain my even breathing so I wouldn\u0027t shiver and shake. His nearness and the tension of being in his presence, the huge strength that hummed through his arms, took me back to a dark ruined shack and two psycho fairies who really had deserved their deaths. My shoulders jerked, and I saw a flash of panic in Dermot\u0027s eyes. Calm. Be calm.\\n\\n I smiled at him. I have a pretty smile, people tell me, though I know it\u0027s a little too bright, a little nuts. However, that suited the conversation perfectly. \"The last time you saw Jason,\" I said, and then couldn\u0027t think how to finish.\\n\\n \"I attacked his companion. The beast who\u0027d hurt Jason\u0027s wife.\"\\n\\n I swallowed hard and smiled some more. \"Probably would\u0027ve been better if you\u0027d explained to Jason why you were going after Mel. And it wasn\u0027t Mel who killed her, you know.\"\\n\\n \"No, it was my own kind that finished her off. But she would have died anyway. He wasn\u0027t taking her to get help, you know.\"\\n\\n Wasn\u0027t much I could say, because his account of what had happened to Crystal was accurate. I noticed I hadn\u0027t gotten a coherent response from Dermot on why he\u0027d left Jason in ignorance of Mel\u0027s crime. \"But you didn\u0027t explain to Jason,\" I said, breathing in and out - in a very soothing way. I hoped. It seemed to me that the longer I touched Dermot, the calmer we both got. And Dermot was markedly more coherent.\\n\\n \"I was very conflicted,\" he said seriously, unexpectedly borrowing from modern jargon.\\n\\n Maybe that was as good an answer as I was going to get. I decided to take another tack. \"Did you want to see Claude?\" I said hopefully. \"He\u0027s living with me now, just temporarily. He should be back later tonight.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not the only one, you know,\" Dermot told me. I looked up and met his mad eyes. I understood that my great-uncle was trying to tell me something. I wished to God I could make him rational. Just for five minutes. I stepped back from him and tried to figure out what he needed.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not the only fairy left out in the human world. I know Claude\u0027s here. Someone else is, too?\" I would\u0027ve enjoyed my telepathy for a couple of minutes.\\n\\n \"Yes. Yes.\" His eyes were pleading with me to understand.\\n\\n I\u0027d risk a direct question. \"Who else is on this side of Faery?\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t want to meet him,\" Dermot assured me. \"You have to be careful. He can\u0027t decide right now. He\u0027s ambivalent.\"\\n\\n \"Right.\" Whoever \"he\" was, he wasn\u0027t the only one who had mixed feelings. I wished I knew the right nutcracker that would open up Dermot\u0027s head.\\n\\n \"Sometimes he\u0027s in your woods.\" Dermot put his hands on my shoulders and squeezed gently. It was like he was trying to transmit things he couldn\u0027t say directly into my flesh.\\n\\n \"I heard about that,\" I said sourly.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t trust other fairies,\" Dermot told me. \"I shouldn\u0027t have.\"\\n\\n I felt like a lightbulb had popped on above my head. \"Dermot, have you had magic put on you? Like a spell?\"\\n\\n The relief in his eyes was almost palpable. He nodded frantically. \"Unless they\u0027re at war, fairies don\u0027t like to kill other fairies. Except for Neave and Lochlan. They liked to kill everything. But I\u0027m not dead. So there\u0027s hope.\"\\n\\n Fairies might be reluctant to kill their own kind, but they didn\u0027t mind making them insane, apparently. \"Is there anything I can do to reverse this spell? Can Claude help?\"\\n\\n \"Claude has little magic, I think,\" Dermot said. \"He\u0027s been living like a human too long. My dearest niece, I love you. How is your brother?\"\\n\\n We were back in nutty land. God bless poor Dermot. I hugged him, following an impulse. \"My brother is happy, Uncle Dermot. He\u0027s dating a woman who suits him, and she won\u0027t take any shit off him, either. Her name is Michele - like my mom\u0027s, but with one l instead of two.\"\\n\\n Dermot smiled down at me. Hard to say how much of this he was absorbing.\\n\\n \"Dead things love you,\" Dermot told me, and I made myself keep smiling.\\n\\n \"Eric the vampire? He says he does.\"\\n\\n \"Other dead things, too. They\u0027re pulling on you.\"\\n\\n That was a not-so-welcome revelation. Dermot was right. I\u0027d been feeling Eric through our bond, as usual, but there were two other gray presences with me every moment after dark: Alexei and Appius Livius. It was a drain on me, and I hadn\u0027t realized it until this moment.\\n\\n \"Tonight,\" Dermot said, \"you\u0027ll receive visitors.\"\\n\\n So now he was a prophet. \"Good ones?\"\\n\\n He shrugged. \"That\u0027s a matter of taste and expedience.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, Uncle Dermot? Do you walk around this land very often?\"\\n\\n \"Too scared of the other one,\" he said. \"But I try to watch you a little.\"\\n\\n I was figuring out if that was a good thing or a bad thing when he vanished. Poof! I saw a kind of blur and then nothing. His hands were on my shoulders, and then they weren\u0027t. I assumed the tension of conversing with another person had gotten to Dermot.\\n\\n Boy. That had been really, really weird.\\n\\n I glanced around me, thinking I might see some other trace of his passage. He might even decide to return. But nothing happened. There wasn\u0027t a sound except the prosaic growl of my stomach, reminding me that I hadn\u0027t eaten lunch and that it was now suppertime. I went into the house on shaking legs and collapsed at the table. Conversation with a spy. Interview with an insane fairy. Oh, yes, phone Jason and tell him to be back on fairy watch. That was something I could do sitting down.\\n\\n After that conversation, I remembered to carry in the newspapers when I got my legs to working again. While I baked a Marie Callender\u0027s pot pie, I read the past two days\u0027 papers.\\n\\n Unfortunately, there was a lot of interest on the front page. There had been a gruesome murder in Shreveport, probably gang-related. The victim had been a young black man wearing gang colors, which was like a blinking arrow to the police, but he hadn\u0027t been shot. He\u0027d been stabbed multiple times, and then his throat had been slashed. Yuck. Sounded more personal than a gang killing to me. Then the next night the same thing had happened again, this time to a kid of nineteen who wore different gang colors. He\u0027d died the same awful way. I shook my head over the stupidity of young men dying over what I considered nothing, and moved on to a story that I found electrifying and very worrisome.\\n\\n The tension over the werewolf registration issue was rising. According to the newspapers, the Weres were the big controversy. The stories hardly mentioned the other two-natured, yet I knew at least one werefox, one werebat, two weretigers, a score of werepanthers, and a shapeshifter. Werewolves, the most numerous of the two-natured, were catching the brunt of the backlash. And they were sounding off about it, as they should have.\\n\\n \"Why should I register, as if I were an illegal alien or a dead citizen?\" Scott Wacker, an army general, was quoted as saying. \"My family has been American for six generations, all of us army people. My daughter\u0027s in Iraq. What more do you want?\"\\n\\n The governor of one of the northwestern states said, \"We need to know who\u0027s a werewolf and who\u0027s not. In the event of an accident, officers need to know, to avoid blood contamination and to aid in identification.\"\\n\\n I plunged my spoon into the crust to release some of the heat from the pot pie. I thought that over. Bullshit, I concluded.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s bushwah,\" General Wacker responded in the next paragraph. So Wacker and I had something in common. \"For one thing, we change back to human form when we\u0027re dead. Officers already glove up when they\u0027re handling bodies. Identification is not going to be any more of a problem than with the one-natured. Why should it be?\"\\n\\n You go, Wacker.\\n\\n According to the newspaper, the debate raged from the people in the streets (including some who weren\u0027t simply people) to members of Congress, from military personnel to firefighters, from law experts to constitutional scholars.\\n\\n Instead of thinking globally or nationally, I tried to evaluate the crowd at Merlotte\u0027s since the announcement. Had revenue fallen off? Yes, there\u0027d been a slight decrease at first, right after the bar patrons had watched Sam change into a dog and Tray become a wolf, but then people had started drinking as much as they had formerly.\\n\\n So was this a created crisis, a nothing issue?\\n\\n Not as much as I would have liked, I decided, having read a few more articles.\\n\\n Some people really hated the idea that individuals they\u0027d known all their lives had another side, a mysterious life unbeknownst (isn\u0027t that a great word? It had been on my Word of the Day calendar the week before) to the general public. That was the impression I\u0027d gotten before, and it seemed that still held true. No one was budging on that position; the Weres got angrier, and the public got more frightened. At least a very vocal part of the public.\\n\\n There had been demonstrations and riots in Redding, California, and Lansing, Michigan. I wondered if there were going to be riots here or in Shreveport. I found that hard to believe and painful to picture. I looked through the kitchen window at the gathering dusk, as if I expected to see a crowd of villagers with torches marching to Merlotte\u0027s.\\n\\n It was a curiously empty evening. There wasn\u0027t much to clean up after I\u0027d eaten, my laundry was up to date, and there was nothing on television I wanted to watch. I checked my e-mail; no message from Judith Vardamon.\\n\\n There was a message from Alcide. \"Sookie, we\u0027ve set the pack meeting for Monday night at eight at my house. We\u0027ve been trying to find a shaman for the judging. I\u0027ll see you and Jason then.\" It had been nearly a week since we\u0027d found Basim\u0027s body in the woods, and this was the first I\u0027d heard. The pack\u0027s \"day or two\" had stretched into six. And that meant it had been a very long time since I\u0027d heard from Eric.\\n\\n I called Jason again and left voice mail on his cell phone. I tried not to worry about the pack meeting, but every time I\u0027d been with the whole pack, something violent had happened.\\n\\n I thought again about the dead man in the grave in the clearing. Who had put him there? Presumably, the killer had wanted Basim\u0027s silence, but the body hadn\u0027t been planted on my land by mistake.\\n\\n I read for thirty minutes or so, and then it was full dark and I felt Eric\u0027s presence, and then the lesser though undeniable company of the other two vampires. As soon as they woke, I felt tired. This made me so twitchy I broke my own resolution.\\n\\n I knew that Eric realized I was unhappy and worried. It was impossible for him not to know that. Maybe he thought by keeping me away he was protecting me. Maybe he didn\u0027t know that his maker and Alexei were both in my consciousness. I took a deep breath and called him. The phone rang, and I pressed it to my ear as though I were holding Eric himself. But I thought, and I wouldn\u0027t have believed this possible a week ago, What if he doesn\u0027t pick up?\\n\\n The phone rang, and I held my breath. After the second ring, Eric answered. \"The pack meeting has been set,\" I blurted.\\n\\n \"Sookie,\" he said. \"Can you come here?\"\\n\\n On my drive to Shreveport, I wondered at least four times if I was doing the right thing. But I concluded that whether I was right or wrong (in running to see Eric when he asked me to) was simply a dead issue. We were both on the ends of the line stretched between us, a line spun from blood. It trumped how we felt about each other at any given moment. I knew he was tired and desperate. He knew I was angry, uneasy, hurt. I wondered, though. If I\u0027d called him and said the same thing, would he have hopped into his car (or into the sky) and arrived on my doorstep?\\n\\n They were all at Fangtasia, he\u0027d said.\\n\\n I was shocked to see how few cars were parked in front of the only vampire bar in Shreveport. Fangtasia was a huge tourist draw in a town that was boasting a tourist increase, and I\u0027d expected it to be packed. There were almost as many cars parked in the employee parking at the back as there were at the main door. That had never happened before.\\n\\n Maxwell Lee, an African-American businessman who also happened to be a vampire, was on duty at the rear entrance, and that was a first, too. The rear door had never been specially guarded, because the vampires were so sure they could take care of themselves. Yet here he was, wearing his usual three-piece suit but doing a task he normally would have considered beneath him. He didn\u0027t look resentful; he looked worried.\\n\\n I said, \"Where are they?\"\\n\\n He jerked his head toward the main room of the bar. \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re here,\" he said, and I knew Eric\u0027s maker\u0027s visit wasn\u0027t going well.\\n\\n So often having out-of-town visitors is awkward, huh? You take them to see the local sights, you try to feed them and keep them entertained, but then you\u0027re really wishing they would leave. It wasn\u0027t hard to see that Eric was on his last nerve. He was sitting in a booth with Appius Livius Ocella and Alexei. Of course, Alexei looked too young to be in a bar, and that added to the absurdity of the moment.\\n\\n \"Good evening,\" I said stiffly. \"Eric, you wanted to see me?\"\\n\\n Eric scooted over closer to the wall so I\u0027d have plenty of room, and I sat by him. Appius Livius and Alexei both greeted me, Appius with a strained smile and Alexei with more ease. When we were all together, I discovered that being close to them relaxed the tense thread inside me, the thread that bound us all together.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve missed you,\" Eric said so quietly that at first I thought I\u0027d imagined it.\\n\\n I wouldn\u0027t refer to the fact that he\u0027d been completely out of touch for days. He knew that.\\n\\n It took all my self-control to bite back a few choice words. \"As I was trying to tell you over the phone, the pack meeting about Basim has been set for Monday night.\"\\n\\n \"Where and when?\" he said, and there was a note in his voice that let me know he was not a happy camper. Well, he could pitch his tent right alongside mine.\\n\\n \"At Alcide\u0027s house. The one that used to be his dad\u0027s. At eight o\u0027clock.\"\\n\\n \"And Jason\u0027s going with you? Without a doubt?\"\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t talked to him yet, but I left him a message.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve been angry with me.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been worried about you.\" I couldn\u0027t tell him anything about how I\u0027d felt that he didn\u0027t already know.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Eric said. His voice was empty.\\n\\n \"Eric is an excellent host,\" the tsarevitch said, as if I expected a report.\\n\\n I scratched up a smile to offer the boy. \"That\u0027s good to hear, Alexei. What have you two been doing? I don\u0027t think you\u0027ve ever been to Shreveport before.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Appius Livius said in his curious accent. \"We hadn\u0027t been here to visit. It\u0027s a nice little city. My older son has been doing his best to keep us busy and out of trouble.\"\\n\\n Okay, that had been a tad on the sarcastic side. I could tell from Eric\u0027s tension that he hadn\u0027t entirely succeeded in the \"keeping them out of trouble\" part of his agenda.\\n\\n \"The World Market is fun. You can get stuff from all over the world there. And Shreveport was the capitol of the Confederacy for a while.\" Geez Louise, I needed to do better than that. \"If you go to the Municipal Auditorium, you can see Elvis\u0027s dressing room,\" I said brightly. I wondered if Bubba ever visited there to see his old stomping grounds.\\n\\n \"I had a very good teenager last night,\" Alexei said, matching my cheerful tone. As though he\u0027d said he\u0027d run a red light.\\n\\n I opened my mouth and nothing came out. If I said the wrong thing, I might be dead right then and there. \"Alexei,\" I said, sounding much calmer than I felt, \"you have to watch it. That\u0027s against the law here. Your maker and Eric could both suffer for it.\"\\n\\n \"When I was with my human family, I could do anything I wanted,\" Alexei said. I really couldn\u0027t read his voice at all. \"I was so sick, they indulged me.\"\\n\\n Eric twitched.\\n\\n \"I can sure understand that,\" I said. \"Any family would be tempted to do that with a sick child. But since you\u0027re well now, and you\u0027ve had lots of years to mature, I know you understand that doing exactly what you want to do is not a good plan.\" I thought of at least twenty other things I could have said, but I stopped right there. And that was a good thing. Appius Livius looked directly into my eyes and nodded almost imperceptibly.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t look grown up,\" Alexei said.\\n\\n Again, too many options on what I could say. The boy - the old, old, boy - definitely expected me to answer. \"No, and it\u0027s an awful pity what happened to you and your family. But - \"\\n\\n And Alexei reached over, took my hand, and showed me what had happened to him and his family. I saw the cellar, the royal family, the doctor, the maid, facing the men who had come to kill them, and I heard the guns fire, and the bullets found their marks; or in the case of the women, they didn\u0027t, since the royal women had sewn jewels into their clothes for the escape that never came about. The jewels saved their lives for all of a few seconds, until the soldiers killed each groaning and bleeding and screaming individual. His mother, his father, his sisters, his doctor, his mother\u0027s maid, the cook, his father\u0027s valet ... and his dog. And after the shooting, the soldiers went around with bayonets.\\n\\n I thought I was going to throw up. I swayed where I sat, and Eric\u0027s cold arm went around me. Alexei had let go, and I was never gladder of anything in my life. I would not have touched the child again for anything.\\n\\n \"You see,\" Alexei said triumphantly. \"You see! I should be free to go my own way.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I said. And I was proud that my voice was firm. \"No matter how we suffer, we have an obligation to others. We have to be unselfish enough to try to live in the right way, so others can get through their own lives without us fouling them up.\"\\n\\n Alexei looked rebellious. \"That\u0027s what Master says, too,\" he muttered. \"More or less.\"\\n\\n \"Master is right,\" I said, though the words tasted bad in my mouth.\\n\\n \"Master\" waved for the bartender to come over. Felicia slunk up to the table. She was tall and pretty and as gentle as a vampire can be. She had some fresh scars on her neck. \"What can I get you-all?\" she said. \"Sookie, can I bring you a beer or ... ?\"\\n\\n \"Some iced tea would be great, Felicia,\" I said.\\n\\n \"And some TrueBlood for all of you?\" she asked the vampires. \"Or, we do have a bottle of Royalty.\"\\n\\n Eric\u0027s eyes closed, and Felicia realized her blunder. \"Okay,\" she said briskly. \"TrueBlood for Eric, tea for Sookie.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you!\" I said, smiling up at the bartender.\\n\\n Pam strode up to the table. She was trailing the gauzy black costume she wore at Fangtasia, and she was as close to panic as I\u0027d ever seen her. \"Excuse me,\" she said, bowing in the direction of the guests. \"Eric, Katherine Boudreaux is visiting Fangtasia tonight. She\u0027s with Sallie and a small party.\"\\n\\n Eric looked as if he were going to explode. \"Tonight,\" he said, and one word spoke volumes. \"With much regret, Ocella, I must ask you and Alexei to go back to my office.\"\\n\\n Appius Livius got up without asking for further explanation, and Alexei, to my surprise, followed him without any questions. If Eric had been in the habit of breathing, I would say that he exhaled with relief when his visitors had left his sight. He said a few things in an ancient tongue, but I didn\u0027t know which one.\\n\\n Then a stout, attractive blonde in her forties was standing by the table, another woman right behind her.\\n\\n \"You must be Katherine Boudreaux,\" I said pleasantly. \"I\u0027m Sookie Stackhouse; I\u0027m Eric\u0027s girlfriend.\"\\n\\n \"Hi, honey. I\u0027m Katherine,\" she said. \"This is my partner, Sallie. We\u0027re here with some friends who were curious about my job. I try to visit all the vampire workplaces during the year, and we hadn\u0027t been to Fangtasia in months. Since I\u0027m based right here in Shreveport, I ought to make it in more often.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re so glad you\u0027re here,\" Eric said smoothly. He sounded like his normal self. \"Sallie, always good to see you. How\u0027s the tax business?\"\\n\\n Sallie, a slim brunette whose hair was just beginning to gray, laughed. \"Taxes are booming, as always,\" she said. \"You ought to know, Eric, you pay enough of them.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s good to see our vampire citizens getting along with our human citizens,\" Katherine said heartily, looking around the bar, which was so thinly populated it almost wasn\u0027t open. Her blond eyebrows contracted slightly for a moment, but that was the only sign Ms. Boudreaux gave that she noticed Eric\u0027s business was down.\\n\\n Pam said, \"Your table is ready!\" She swept her hand toward two tables that had been put together for the party, and the state BVA agent said, \"Excuse me, Eric. I\u0027ve gotta go pay attention to my company.\"\\n\\n After a shower of pleasantries and pleased-to-meet-yous, we were finally by ourselves, if sitting in a booth in the middle of a bar can be counted as being by ourselves. Pam started over, but Eric checked her with a raised finger. He took my hand with one of his and rested his forehead on his other hand.\\n\\n \"Can you tell me what\u0027s up with you?\" I said bluntly. \"This is awful. It\u0027s very hard to have faith in us when I don\u0027t know what\u0027s happening.\"\\n\\n \"Ocella has had some business to discuss with me,\" Eric said. \"Some unwelcome business. And as you saw, my half brother is ailing.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, he shared that with me,\" I said. It was still hard to believe what I\u0027d seen and suffered with the child, through his memory of the deaths of everyone he\u0027d loved. The tsarevitch of Russia, sole survivor of a mass murder, could use some counseling. Maybe he and Dermot could be in the same therapy group. \"You don\u0027t go through something like that and come out Mr. Mental Health, but I\u0027ve never experienced anything like that. I know it must have been hell for him, but I\u0027ve got to say ...\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t want to go through it, too,\" Eric said. \"You\u0027re not alone in that. It\u0027s clearest for us: Ocella, me, you. But he can share that with other people, too. It\u0027s not as detailed for them, they tell me. No one wants that memory. We all carry plenty of our own bad memories. I\u0027m afraid that he may not be able to survive as a vampire.\" He paused, turning the bottle of TrueBlood around and around on the table. \"Apparently, it\u0027s a nightly grind to get Alexei to do the simplest things. And not to do others. You heard his remark about the teenager. I don\u0027t want to go into the details. However ... have you read the papers lately, the Shreveport papers?\"\\n\\n \"You mean Alexei might be responsible for those two murders?\" I could only sit there staring at Eric. \"The stab wounds, the throats? But he\u0027s so small and young.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s insane,\" Eric said. \"Ocella finally told me that Alexei had had episodes like this before - not as severe. It has led him to consider, very reluctantly, giving Alexei the final death.\"\\n\\n \"You mean putting him to sleep?\" I said, not sure I\u0027d heard him right. \"Like a dog?\"\\n\\n Eric looked me straight in the eyes. \"Ocella loves the boy, but he cannot be allowed to kill people or other vampires when these fits take him. Such incidents will get into the paper. What if he were caught? What if some Russian recognized him as a result of the notoriety? What would that do to our relationship with the Russian vampires? Most important, Ocella cannot keep track of him every moment. Two times, the boy has gotten out on his own. And two deaths resulted. In my area! He\u0027ll subvert all we\u0027re trying to do here in the United States. Not that my maker cares about my position in this country,\" Eric added, a little bitterly.\\n\\n I gave Eric a sort of heavy pat on the cheek. Not a slap. A heavy pat. \"Yeah, let\u0027s not forget the two dead men,\" I said. \"That Alexei murdered, in a painful and horrible way. I mean, I realize that this is all about him and your maker and your personal cred, but let\u0027s spare a tip of the hat to those guys he killed.\"\\n\\n Eric shrugged. He was worried and he was at his wit\u0027s end, and he didn\u0027t care at all about the deaths of two humans. He was probably thankful that Alexei had picked victims who wouldn\u0027t attract much sympathy and whose deaths were easily explained. Gang members killed one another all the time, after all. I gave up on making my point. At least partly because I\u0027d had a thought - if Alexei was capable of turning against his own kind, maybe we could steer him onto Victor?\\n\\n I shuddered. I was creeping myself out. \"So your maker brought Alexei to you hoping that you\u0027d have some bright ideas about keeping your half brother alive, teaching him some self-control?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. That\u0027s one of the reasons he\u0027s here.\"\\n\\n \"Appius Livius having sex with the kid can\u0027t be helping Alexei\u0027s mental health,\" I said, since I simply couldn\u0027t not say it.\\n\\n \"Please understand. In Ocella\u0027s time, that was not a consideration,\" Eric said. \"Alexei would be old enough, in those times. And men of a certain station were free to indulge themselves with very little guilt or question. Ocella doesn\u0027t think in the modern way about such things. As it happens, Alexei has become so ... Well, they are not having sex now. Ocella is an honorable man.\" Eric sounded very intent, very serious, as if he had to persuade me of his maker\u0027s integrity. And all this concern was about the man who\u0027d murdered him. But if Eric admired Ocella, respected him, didn\u0027t I have to do the same?\\n\\n And - it popped into my head that Eric wasn\u0027t doing anything for his brother that I wouldn\u0027t do for mine.\\n\\n Then I had another unwelcome thought, and my mouth went dry. \"If Appius Livius isn\u0027t having sex with Alexei, who is he having sex with?\" I asked in a small voice.\\n\\n \"I know this is your business, since we\u0027re married - something I\u0027ve insisted on and you\u0027ve belittled,\" Eric said, and the bitterness was back in his voice. \"I can only tell you that I\u0027m not having sex with my maker. But I would if he told me that was what he wanted. I would have no choice.\"\\n\\n I tried to think of a way to round this conversation off, escape with some dignity. \"Eric, you\u0027re busy with your visitors.\" Busy in a way I\u0027d never imagined. \"I\u0027m going to that meeting at Alcide\u0027s Monday night. I\u0027ll tell you what happens, when and if you call me. There are a couple of things I need to bring you up to speed on, if you ever have a chance to come to my place to talk.\" Like Dermot appearing on my doorstep. That was a story Eric would be interested to hear, and God knows I wanted to tell him about it. But now was not the right time.\\n\\n \"If they stay until Tuesday, I\u0027m going to see you no matter what they\u0027re doing,\" Eric told me. He sounded a little more like himself. \"We\u0027ll make love. I feel like buying you a present.\"\\n\\n \"That sounds like a great night to me,\" I said, feeling a surge of hope. \"I don\u0027t need a present, just you. So I\u0027ll see you Tuesday, no matter what. That\u0027s what you said, right?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I said.\"\\n\\n \"Okay then, until Tuesday.\"\\n\\n \"I love you,\" Eric said in a drained voice. \"And you are my wife, in the only way that matters to me.\"\\n\\n \"Love you, too,\" I said, passing on the last half of his closing statement because I didn\u0027t know what it meant. I got up to go, and Pam appeared by my side to walk me to my car. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Eric get up and walk over to the Boudreaux table to make sure his important visitors were happy.\\n\\n Pam said, \"He\u0027ll ruin Eric if he stays.\"\\n\\n \"How so?\"\\n\\n \"The boy will kill again, and we won\u0027t be able to cover it up. He can escape if you so much as blink. He has to be watched constantly. Yet Ocella argues with himself about putting the boy down.\"\\n\\n \"Pam, let Ocella decide,\" I warned her. I thought since we were by ourselves I could take the huge liberty of calling Eric\u0027s maker by his personal name. \"I\u0027m serious. Eric\u0027ll have to let him kill you if you take Alexei out.\"\\n\\n \"You care, don\u0027t you?\" Pam was unexpectedly touched.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re my bud,\" I said. \"Of course I care.\"\\n\\n \"We are friends,\" Pam said.\\n\\n \"You know it.\"\\n\\n \"This isn\u0027t going to end well,\" Pam said, as I got in my car.\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t think of a single thing to say.\\n\\n She was right.\\n\\n I ate a Little Debbie cinnamon roll when I got home, just because I thought I deserved one. I was so worried I couldn\u0027t even think of going to bed just yet. Alexei had given me his own personal nightmare. I\u0027d never heard of a vampire (or any other being, human or not) being able to transmit a memory like that. It struck me as peculiarly horrible that it should be Alexei who was so \"gifted,\" when he had such a ghastly memory to share. I went though the royal family\u0027s excruciating ordeal again. I could understand why the boy was the way he was. But I could also understand why he might have to be - put to sleep. I pushed up from the table, feeling thoroughly exhausted. I was ready for bed. But my plan got altered when the doorbell rang.\\n\\n You\u0027d think, living out in the country at the end of a long driveway through the woods, that I would have plenty of warning of guests. But that wasn\u0027t always the case, especially with supes. I didn\u0027t recognize the woman I saw through the peephole, but I knew she was a vampire. That meant she couldn\u0027t come in without being invited, so it was safe to find out why she was there. I opened the door, feeling mostly curious.\\n\\n \"Hi, can I help you?\" I asked.\\n\\n She looked me up and down. \"Are you Sookie Stackhouse?\"\\n\\n \"I am.\"\\n\\n \"You e-mailed me.\"\\n\\n Alexei had blown out my brain cells. I was slow tonight. \"Judith Vardamon?\"\\n\\n \"The same.\"\\n\\n \"So Lorena was your sire? Your maker?\"\\n\\n \"She was.\"\\n\\n \"Please come in,\" I said, and stepped aside. I might have been making a big mistake, but I\u0027d almost given up hope that Judith would respond to my message. Since she\u0027d come all the way here from Little Rock, I thought I owed her that much trust.\\n\\n Judith raised her eyebrows and stepped over my threshold. \"You must love Bill, or else you\u0027re a fool,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Neither, I hope. You want some TrueBlood?\"\\n\\n \"Not now, thank you.\"\\n\\n \"Please, have a seat.\"\\n\\n I sat on the edge of the recliner while Judith took the couch. I thought it was incredible that Lorena had \"made\" both Bill and Judith. I wanted to ask a lot of questions, but I didn\u0027t want to offend or irritate this vampire, who\u0027d already done me a huge favor.\\n\\n \"Do you know Bill?\" I said, to kick off the talk we had to have.\\n\\n \"Yes, I know him.\" She seemed cautious, which was odd when I considered how much stronger she was than I.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re the younger sister?\" She looked to be about thirty, or at least that had been her death age. She had dark brown hair and blue eyes, and she was short and pleasantly round. She was one of the most nonthreatening vampires I\u0027d ever met, at least superficially. And she looked oddly familiar.\\n\\n \"I beg your pardon?\"\\n\\n \"Lorena turned you after she turned Bill? Why\u0027d she pick you?\"\\n\\n \"You were Bill\u0027s lover for some months, I gather? Reading between the lines of your message?\" she asked in turn.\\n\\n \"Yes, I was. I\u0027m with someone else now.\"\\n\\n \"How is it that he never told you how he came to meet Lorena?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. His choice.\"\\n\\n \"Very strange.\" She looked openly distrustful.\\n\\n \"You can think it\u0027s strange till the cows come home,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t know why Bill didn\u0027t tell me, but he didn\u0027t. If you want to tell me, fine. Tell me. But that\u0027s not really important. The important thing is that Bill\u0027s not getting well. He got bitten by a fairy with silver-tipped teeth. If he has your blood, he might get over it.\"\\n\\n \"Did Bill perhaps hint to you that you should ask me?\"\\n\\n \"No, ma\u0027am, he didn\u0027t. But I hate to see him hurting.\"\\n\\n \"Has he mentioned my name?\"\\n\\n \"Ah. No. I found out by myself so I could get in touch with you. It seems to me that if you\u0027re Lorena\u0027s get, too, you must have known he was suffering. I find myself wondering why you haven\u0027t shown up before.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell you why.\" Judith\u0027s voice was ominous.\\n\\n Oh, great, another tale of pain and suffering. I knew I wasn\u0027t going to like this story.\\n\\n I was right. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-in-the-family-sookie-stackhouse-10/page-12.html","bookId":2200,"book":{"id":2200,"title":"Dead in the Family (Sookie Stackhouse #10)","description":"Storyline: Dead in the Family (Sookie Stackhouse #10) \\n It\u0027s all about family ... \\n Sookie Stackhouse is dealing with a whole host of family problems, ranging from her own kin (a non-human fairy and a telepathic second cousin) demanding a place in her life, to her lover Eric\u0027s vampire sire, an ancient being who arrives with Eric\u0027s \u0027brother\u0027 in tow at a most inopportune moment.
