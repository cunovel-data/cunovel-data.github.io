{"id":80744,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"“Scott, all I saw was you about to fall and Paine here tried to prevent that. Seems you tripped anyway.” Law’s words shock me.\\n\\n “You can’t be fucking serious right now,” Scott barks out, but keeps his distance no matter how hostile his tone is. He’s smart enough now to keep a few feet between us. That’s good. At least he understands I’m not fucking around here.\\n\\n “I don’t have time for your shit today.” I have a feeling the Sheriff Isn’t talking about mine and Scott’s shit, but probably the Mayor’s.\\n\\n “He’s going to hear about this,” Scott fires back, but Law just shrugs his shoulders like he doesn’t give a shit. I find that hard to believe, with the Mayor being his father and all.\\n\\n “Whatever. I have a date to catch with Penelope.” He turns to walk off, and Law has me by the arm. I didn’t even realize I was lunging for the dipshit. “I’ll haul you in if you make me.”\\n\\n I jerk from his hold but stay rooted as I watch Scott jump into his car and speed off. Looking around, I see a good portion of the town staring at us, probably having seen most of what just went down.\\n\\n I don’t know much about Law other than Joey might be head over heels for the guy, judging by the song she was singing this morning at work. But how could he let a shit like Scott marry Penelope?\\n\\n “You’re going to let that pompous fuck marry your little sister?” The distaste is clear in my voice.\\n\\n “Stay out of it, Paine. This is family business you don’t know anything about.”\\n\\n “I know a man like Scott would ruin a woman like her.”\\n\\n “I agree,” he says, and starts to walk away. I grab him by the shoulder like he did to me moments ago.\\n\\n “You agree?” I’m being loud, and I don’t give a shit who hears us, but apparently Law does because he leans in closer to me.\\n\\n “I’m doing what I can but trying to keep my hands clean. It’s not your concern. Like you said, she’s my sister.”\\n\\n “She my woman.”\\n\\n “I don’t believe town gossip,” he says, referring to the whispers running around town. “I’ve also never heard my sister even utter your name, so to me she’s not your anything.”\\n\\n It’s on the tip of my tongue to tell him she moaned my name over and over just today, but I won’t make what I have with her dirty. What we have and what we’ve done is special, and I won’t throw it around like that. It might be dirty between us, but between us is where it fucking stays.\\n\\n “Please, Sherriff. Tell me where Dipshit and Penelope are going tonight and I’ll make sure she doesn’t end up with him. I’ll make it my life’s mission to keep her from making a mistake and walking down the aisle with that piece of shit.” I can see the hesitation in his eyes as he looks away and looks back at me. “Don’t let her do this.”\\n\\n He takes a deep breath, making a decision, and nods his head.\\n\\n “Deal.”\\n\\n Eight\\n\\n Paine\\n\\n That’s it. I’m done fucking around. I tried being nice and talking sweet, but I’m through with that. I don’t care why she’s marrying that douche. It’s over.\\n\\n I’ve got my bike parked in front of Lucinda’s, the fancy Italian place two towns over. It’s funny that Scott is willing to fuck Tammy in the middle of our small town, but he makes the woman he’s supposed to be getting married to have someone drive her almost an hour away. It’s as if Penelope is the dirty secret, and that thought makes me even madder. She’s mine, and she’s something to be proud of.\\n\\n I wait for a long time until I finally see a dark town car pull up and Penelope step out. Scott still isn’t here, but as the driver pulls away, I’m guessing the plan was for him to drive her back home. That thought has me off my bike in a flash and crossing the street to get to her.\\n\\n Penelope is in a black dress and black heels. Her blonde hair is pulled into a tight knot at the nape of her neck, and it looks like she’s got on a ton of make-up. She looks like she’s a different person than the sweet sexy girl I had breakfast with this morning. I hate it.\\n\\n When I get to the front of the restaurant, she turns and faces me, the shock clear in her eyes.\\n\\n “Paine? What are you doing here? You have to leave. Scott is going to be here any second.”\\n\\n “I don’t give a fuck.” I grab her by the wrist and pull her behind me, walking towards my motorcycle. I turn around and take off my leather jacket, holding it out for her to take. “Put this on and climb on the back.”\\n\\n “Paine.” There’s a plea in her eyes, and as she looks over her shoulder to the restaurant and then turns back to look at me, indecision runs through her mind. “It’s not that I don’t want to go because believe me, I do. It’s because I can’t.\\n\\n “Duchess, I don’t know what’s happening with you and that dipshit, but the wedding isn’t happening. You’re mine, so get your ass on the back of my bike. You’re coming home with me tonight and every night after.”\\n\\n “This is ridiculous.” She stomps her foot when she says the last word, and it makes me smile. “I can’t go with you. Things could go really bad for me if I don’t do this.” She takes a small step towards me, and her eyes plead with me again. “I want more than anything to run away, but this isn’t just about me.”\\n\\n I reach out, grabbing her chin, and keep my eyes locked with hers. I don’t want her to miss anything I’m about to say because this is crucial. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mechanic-breeding-2/page-15.html","bookId":1799,"book":{"id":1799,"title":"Mechanic (Breeding #2)","description":"Storyline: Everything was fine until that innocent little rich girl walked into my garage.
