{"id":80742,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"“Paine?” Her voice brings me back to earth, and I shake my head, trying to find reality again. I close my eyes and lay my forehead against her belly. Breathing in the scent of her pussy.\n “Just a taste. For now,” I say against her skin, and I lick around her belly button. I look up at her and move my hand so my fingers gently spread her lips and rub her damp clit. “I’m gonna be the first to get it, Duchess. But not here and not like this.”\n She moans and closes her eyes, and I dip my fingers lower, playing at her entrance. I move down a little and kiss the insides of her thighs. Her sweet smell is making my mouth water, and I can’t wait any longer. Her legs are bound together at her knees by her jeans and panties, so I’m only able to spread them a little as I lick down between her legs. I grip her thighs, taking a handful of each as her nectar hits my tongue. She’s sweeter than anything I’ve ever tasted, and one drop has me addicted.\n “Mmm,” is all I can say as my tongue moves all over her virgin pussy.\n “Paine.” She moans out my name like she’s as desperate as my dick is. He’s begging to come out and play, but I know the second my cock hits air, I’m gonna need to fuck her. So for now, I keep it in my pants.\n “Do it, Duchess. Show me what a dirty girl you can be.” I rub my chin on her clit, letting my beard soak up her juice. “That’s your payment, baby. You can’t get your car back until you cum on my face. Now wipe that pussy on my tongue and earn it.”\n I feel her cunt pulse against my face as I devour her. I can’t get enough of her, and the more I drink her down, the closer she is to getting off. Hearing she’s never had this before has me wanting to give her the best. I want to be the only one she thinks of ever again.\n Sucking her clit hard, I feel her body bow off the desk, and I squeeze her thighs tighter, holding her down. Her orgasm is hard and deep, and she shouts my name as she hits her peak.\n Hearing her voice echo through my office makes me feel like a god. I’ve been places and done things in my life, but nothing compares to the feeling of being the first to eat her pussy.\n And I’ll be her last, if I have anything to say about it.\n Six\n Penelope\n “Try this one, Grandma.” I hand her another sample of cake, taking the two others from her lap. I stopped at the cake shop and brought all the samples back to the family estate. This isn’t the wedding I dreamed of, but I know my grandmother wants to be a part of it, and it’s something I want to give her. I could put on a fake smile and pretend this was what I wanted, because if I don’t I know she’d worry. She’d start asking questions and would probably be on the phone to my father, and he wouldn’t let me back on the property to see her. Probably make up some lie about me leaving the country or something. I don’t like lying to her, but I want us to be able to see each other, and I’ll do whatever I can to make that happen. I know our days are numbered as it is with her health declining.\n “They all kind of taste the same,” she says, taking another bite of what seems like the twentieth sample of cake this afternoon. Maybe that giant breakfast was a bad idea. I tingle between my thighs just thinking about what Paine and I did afterwards. Nope, it was totally worth it. One of the small pleasures I was going to take for myself.\n “Yeah, I say we just pick one.” Moving the plates over to a side table, I lie across the end of my grandma’s bed and unbutton my jeans. If I keep this up, I won’t fit into the wedding dress. Then maybe I won’t have to get married.\n “Go with the vanilla bean then. It has a nice filling.” She sets the plate down on her nightstand, then pulls out a ring box from the drawer.\n “I’ve been wanting to show you this. Do you remember it?” She hands me a small velvet box, and I open it, gasping at the ring inside. It’s a beautiful circular diamond, surrounded by a halo of sapphires. The band is studded with diamonds that wrap all the way around, making it look antique. It’s the most perfect ring I’ve ever seen.\n “Your grandpa gave me that.”\n I pull it out of the box and read the inscription.\n Only you. Only us. Forever.\n “I’ve never seen you wear it.” My eyes drop to her ring finger, which bears the wedding ring she’s worn ever since I can remember. It’s a simple gold band that looks beat up after all the years of wear.\n “I did from time to time to make your grandpa happy when he was alive, but I could never bear to take this one off.” She runs her wrinkled hand over the gold band on her ring finger. “This was the one he gave me when he didn’t have a penny to his name. The one he asked me to marry him with. This is the one I’ll be buried with. He only gave me that one because he thought I’d want something better.”\n She moves the gold band back and forth on her finger, and can I can tell she’s having memories about him. “I never cared about all this.” She waves her hands around, indicting the house and their wealth. Grandpa played the stock market, and it paid off big. “I’m happy that I don’t have to worry about you, and I know your grandpa felt the same. He wanted to make sure we never went without, but I’d give it all away to have even just one more day with him.”\n “I wish I could remember him better,” I tell her, putting the ring back in the box. Life seemed like it was so different before I was born. So much love filled the house. I don’t know how my father snaked his way in, but it just didn’t fit. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mechanic-breeding-2/page-13.html","bookId":1799,"book":{"id":1799,"title":"Mechanic (Breeding #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Everything was fine until that innocent little rich girl walked into my garage.
