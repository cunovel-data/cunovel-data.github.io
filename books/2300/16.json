Even though his body wasn\u0027t there, she visited his grave each week to make sure it had fresh flowers. Sometimes, when the weather was nice, she pretended his body was buried there and she spent the afternoon by the grave, reading to him from a book of poetry; sometimes she told him about Anton and how proud of him she was.\n \"I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll be as talented as you were.\" She caressed the headstone, her fingers tracing the letters of his name. \"He\u0027s such a handsome young man, so like you in every way. You\u0027ll be so pleased when you see him. I\u0027ve kept your lab just the way you left it. I\u0027ll be using it soon. Anton will have to help me subdue the vampire. I was going to use the woman\u0027s blood for the blood of an enemy, but I think Roshan\u0027s will be more effective. I\u0027ll probably have to kill him...\"\n She smiled. \"Or maybe I\u0027ll let you do that. Would that please you?\" she queried. Then, thinking about it, she frowned. \"I think we might have to kill them all.\"\n Dropping down on her knees, she pressed a kiss to the top of the headstone. \"Rest well, my beloved, until next we meet.\"\n Soon, she thought, soon the time would be right and they would be together forever, as they were meant to be. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-touch-children-of-the-night-2/page-16.html","bookId":2300,"book":{"id":2300,"title":"Night\u0027s Touch (Children of The Night #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Night\u0027s Touch (Children of The Night #2) \n One kiss can seal your fate... \n Cara DeLongpre wandered into the mysterious Nocturne club looking for a fleeting diversion from her sheltered life.
