{"id":93988,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"She was dreaming and she knew she was dreaming, but she couldn\u0027t stop, couldn\u0027t wake up. The men who had accosted her were dead and yet, in her dream, they surrounded her, their eyes filled with menace as their hands reached for her. They dragged her out of her car and threw her on the ground. One held a knife at her throat while another bent over her, his foul breath making her sick to her stomach. He was lowering himself onto her when a large black wolf appeared out of nowhere. With a low growl, the wolf attacked the men, ripping out their throats, lapping at their blood... She woke with a scream on her lips, her body bathed in perspiration. \"Cara, shh, it\u0027s all right, I\u0027m here.\" She blinked at the man beside her, her heart pounding like a wild thing. For a moment, one strange moment, she thought she was staring at the wolf from her nightmare. \"Vince!\" With a cry, she flung herself into his arms. \"It\u0027s all right, darlin\u0027. It was just a bad dream.\" She nodded, her arms tight around him. \"But it was so real.\" He brushed her hair away from her face and then lightly stroked her back. \"I\u0027m here.\" She looked up at him, her beautiful blue eyes wide and scared. \"Don\u0027t leave me, Vince. Promise me you\u0027ll never leave me.\" \"I\u0027ll always be here, darlin\u0027,\" he promised. \"For as long as you want me around.\" She kissed his cheek, and then she smiled. \"Then you\u0027ll always be here.\" Vince was gone when Cara woke in the morning. Sitting up, she pressed the pillow he had used to her face and sighed as she breathed in his now-familiar scent. She had it bad, she thought. Really bad, when just the thought of him brought a smile to her face and caused her heart to pound as if she\u0027d just run a marathon. Last night he had promised he would never leave her... happiness welled inside her, and then she was overcome with a wave of guilt. What right did she have to be so happy when Di Giorgio was lying in the hospital in intensive care? Rising, she took a quick shower, dressed, had breakfast, and drove to the hospital. When she reached intensive care, the nurse advised her that Frank had been moved to a private room on the second floor. Cara thanked the nurse and took the elevator down to the second floor. She found Di Giorgio sitting up in bed reading the newspaper. Bouquets of flowers and baskets of fruit occupied every inch of available space. He looked up when she entered the room. \"Miss DeLongpre.\" Cara shook her head. \"Honestly, Frank,\" she said as she drew a chair closer to the bed, \"don\u0027t you think it\u0027s time you called me Cara?\" \"I\u0027m surprised you\u0027re speaking to me at all,\" he muttered bleakly. \"What are you talking about?\" \"I failed you.\" He shook his head, his eyes filled with self-condemnation. \"The first time you really needed me, and I failed you. Maybe it\u0027s time I retired.\" \"You didn\u0027t fail me. I\u0027d probably be dead now if it wasn\u0027t for you.\" He snorted softly. \"And I\u0027d be dead if it wasn\u0027t for whoever, or whatever, jumped those hoods.\" Cara frowned. What did he mean, \"whatever\"? \"It was Vince,\" she said. \"If you say so.\" \"What are you talking about? I saw him.\" \"If you say so. Whatever I saw had eyes as red as hell-fire. And it growled.\" He shook his head. \"I could have imagined it, I guess.\" \"You must have,\" Cara said, but even as she spoke the words, she remembered standing on the balcony of her bedroom and seeing a pair of red eyes staring up at her from the yard below. \"I\u0027m so sorry this happened.\" \"I\u0027m sorry I let you down.\" Cara shook her head. The man had been shot while protecting her and he felt he had failed. \"If you hadn\u0027t been there, it would have been a lot worse. Now, stop blaming yourself and just get better.\" A smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" \"Do you need anything, Frank?\" \"Are you kidding? Your father\u0027s taking good care of me. I told him I was well enough to go home, but he told me to stay put for a day or two. Not only that, but he\u0027s having all my meals catered so I don\u0027t have to eat hospital food.\" He snorted softly. \"I get new flowers or a fruit basket every hour. I\u0027ve had so many, the nurses are giving them to other patients. In addition to all that, your father gave me a raise.\" Cara smiled, pleased that Frank was being well taken care of. She had come to the hospital expecting to find him at death\u0027s door; instead, he looked as strong and fit as ever. Rising, she took his hand and gave it a squeeze. \"If there\u0027s anything I can do for you, let me know.\" He nodded. \"Thanks for coming.\" \"I\u0027m sure my folks will be by later tonight,\" she said, and wondered if Frank knew that his employers were vampires. Di Giorgio nodded. \"You be careful out there.\" \"I will.\" After pulling out of the hospital parking lot, Cara glanced in her rearview mirror. For the first time in years, Di Giorgio wasn\u0027t behind her. It seemed odd not to have him following her. For years, she had thought it was foolish of her parents to insist she have a bodyguard. Now that he was gone, she felt suddenly vulnerable-and guilty. Frank Di Giorgio was in the hospital and it was all her fault. At home again, she called a florist, and even though Frank didn\u0027t need any more flowers, she ordered a bouquet to be sent to his room. And then, knowing he had a sweet tooth, she called the best candy store in the city and asked them to send him a two-pound box of assorted chocolates. It wasn\u0027t much, but it made her feel better. After kicking off her shoes, she opened a couple of windows, then took the trash outside and dumped it in the barrel, only to hurry back inside when she heard the phone ringing. She grabbed the receiver, hoping it was Vince, felt her heart skip a beat when she heard his voice. \"Hey, darlin\u0027, where\u0027ve you been? I\u0027ve been calling you all morning.\" \"Oh, I went over to the hospital to see Frank.\" \"How\u0027s he doing?\" \"He looks fine. He\u0027s in a private room.\" \"How are you?\" \"I\u0027m okay.\" \"You sure?\" \"Yes.\" She smiled into the receiver. \"Will I see you later?\" \"You bet.\" She heard the sound of a horn honking in the background. \"Blast, I\u0027ve got to go,\" Vince said. \"I\u0027ve got a customer. I\u0027ll see you soon.\" \"All right. Bye.\" \"Bye, darlin\u0027.\" Sarah Beth\u0027s eyes widened in horror when Cara told her what had happened the night before. \"You could have been killed! Or worse! Are you all right?\" Sarah Beth\u0027s narrow-eyed gaze moved over Cara from top to bottom. \"You must have been terrified!\" she exclaimed. \"That doesn\u0027t even come close to describing it.\" \"That\u0027s some bodyguard you\u0027ve got. You could have been killed.\" \"Bethy, he got shot twice trying to save me. He could have been killed, too, you know. Both of us might have been killed if Vince hadn\u0027t come home when he did.\" Sarah Beth sighed. \"Who says there are no more knights in shining armor?\" Cara shook her head. \"Honestly, Bethy, you find romance in everything.\" \"You mean to tell me you aren\u0027t impressed with the man? He shows up out of nowhere to save you in the nick of time, just like the Seventh Cavalry.\" Cara laughed. \"Make up your mind, girlfriend. Is he a chivalrous knight or a brave soldier?\" \"I think he\u0027s both, don\u0027t you?\" \"Yes,\" Cara admitted, \"I do.\" A dark, violent part of her wished she had seen him fighting off the thugs who had accosted her, but it had been too dark to see anything clearly. She suddenly remembered that Frank had told her he heard a growl. Now that she thought about it, she was sure she had heard one, too. Probably just a dog. Sarah Beth hugged her. \"I\u0027m just glad you\u0027re all right. Listen, why don\u0027t you and Mr. Macho come over Monday night? We could have dinner and go to a movie.\" \"I\u0027d love to, but my folks are coming over.\" \"Well, how about next Monday?\" \"I\u0027ll have to ask Vince,\" Cara said, and even as she said the words, he was striding through the library doors, as big as you please. He smiled when he saw her. Dressed in black jeans, a white T-shirt, and a black jacket, he didn\u0027t look much like a knight or a soldier, but he looked sexy as all get-out as he walked toward her. \"What are you doing here so early?\" she asked. \"It\u0027s not even six.\" \"I couldn\u0027t wait until later,\" he said. \"I had to see for myself that you\u0027re all right.\" \"A true knight,\" Sarah Beth murmured for Cara\u0027s ears alone. Walking toward the door, she said, \"Behave yourselves, you two.\" \"What fun is that?\" Vince said, drawing Cara into his arms. \"Vince,\" Cara admonished. \"The door.\" He kicked it shut with his heel. \"Can I kiss you now?\" \"Hmm, please.\" His kiss was slow and wickedly sensual. Lowering his head, he nuzzled her neck. \"I\u0027ve been missing you all day.\" \"Me, too, you.\" \"Good.\" He captured her lips with his own, his tongue delving into her mouth. Desire shot through Cara with the intensity of a lightning bolt, stealing her breath and her thoughts, leaving her aware of nothing but his body pressed intimately against hers, the seduction of his mouth on hers, the strength of his arms, and the evidence of his arousal. She didn\u0027t know how many times the phone rang before it penetrated the haze of passion that engulfed her. Grabbing the receiver, she managed a raspy, \"Miss DeLongpre, can I help you?\" She listened to the voice on the other end, made what she hoped were the proper responses, and said good-bye. When she hung up the receiver, she couldn\u0027t remember who she\u0027d been talking to or what the man had wanted. \"One more kiss,\" Vince said, pulling her into his embrace again, \"and then I\u0027d better go.\" \"Do you have to?\" She had visions of herself locking her office door and making love to Vince on top of her desk, or maybe on the floor... The gleam in his eyes told her he knew what she was thinking. \"You\u0027ve still got three hours of work ahead of you,\" he reminded her, \"and I\u0027ve got a few things at the shop to finish up.\" He kissed the tip of her nose. \"I\u0027ll see you at nine. Don\u0027t go outside until I get here.\" \"Yes, master! Oh, wait, Sarah Beth wants us to come over for dinner a week from Monday and then go to a movie. Can you make it?\" \"I\u0027ll have to see what\u0027s on my calendar and let you know, okay?\" \"Okay.\" And so saying, he kissed her again, hard and quick, and then he was gone, leaving her to stare after him, her fingertips pressed to her lips, his taste still on her tongue. Oh, yes, she thought again. She had it bad. Vince was as good as his word. He arrived at the library at nine sharp. Cara bid a quick good-bye to Sarah Beth, grabbed her handbag, and hurried outside, eager to be alone with Vince. \"Do you want to go out?\" he asked. \"No, let\u0027s go home. Did you check your calendar?\" \"No, I forgot.\" He hated lying to her again, but dinner with her friend just wasn\u0027t in the cards. \"So, your place or mine?\" \"Mine,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t have a nosey cat. Besides, I want to change into something more comfortable.\" \"Like nothing at all?\" he asked with a wicked grin. She batted her eyelashes at him. \"Maybe, maybe not. Guess you\u0027ll just have to wait and see.\" \"I\u0027m game,\" he said, \"but \u0027nothing at all\u0027 has my vote.\" \"Men!\" she muttered, her tone indicating she had tons of experience on the subject though she really had very little. \"Oh, Vince, maybe we should swing by the hospital and see how Frank\u0027s doing.\" \"Whatever you want, darlin\u0027,\" Vince said. \"You\u0027re going to spoil me, you know,\" Cara said, unlocking her car door. \"That\u0027s my plan.\" \"The hospital first, then,\" she said. With a nod, he closed her door, then went to his own car. When they arrived at the hospital, they learned that Frank had signed himself out earlier that day. \"I guess he\u0027s feeling better,\" Cara said as they walked back to the parking lot. Vince grunted softly, wondering what kind of effect Roshan\u0027s blood would have on the bodyguard. It wouldn\u0027t make him a vampire, but it might increase his strength and his longevity. He followed Cara home and pulled into the driveway after her, only then realizing that she already had company. Her mother and father were waiting for them on the front porch. As usual, her father was attired in black from head to foot. Her mother wore a gauzy white blouse, a colorful skirt, and suede boots. A necklace of amber and jet circled her throat. Cara felt a twinge of unease as she climbed the stairs. \"Mom, Dad, is something wrong?\" \"No, dear,\" her mother said, smiling. \"We were just worried about you, that\u0027s all.\" \"I\u0027m fine.\" \"I can see that,\" Brenna said, \"but after last night... we just wanted to make sure you were okay.\" \"Oh.\" Cara glanced at Vince, then unlocked the front door and stepped inside. Vince followed her. Roshan and Brenna remained on the porch. When Cara realized her parents were still outside, she turned back toward the door. \"Aren\u0027t you two coming in?\" \"We can\u0027t enter without an invitation,\" her father said. \"Remember?\" \"Oh, right,\" she said, recalling that vampires needed an invitation. \"So, you really can\u0027t come in unless I invite you?\" Her father nodded. \"Exactly.\" Cara grinned, thinking how odd that was. \"What happens if you try?\" \"The threshold repels us.\" \"I don\u0027t believe it.\" \"Would you like a demonstration?\" \"Sure.\" Cara stepped back and her father moved forward. As soon as he reached the threshold and tried to cross, it was like he ran into an invisible barrier. \"Are you doing that on purpose?\" she asked. \"No.\" \"Amazing. Well, come on in, both of you.\" Although he was standing a few feet behind Cara, Vince felt the ripple of preternatural power as her mother and father crossed the threshold into the house. He glanced at Cara, but she seemed unaware of it. It was probably a good thing, he mused. If she didn\u0027t sense her father\u0027s power, then she probably hadn\u0027t sensed his, either, though her father\u0027s power was so strong, Vince wondered how she could remain oblivious. But then, most mortals were completely ignorant of the supernatural world. Cara smiled at her parents. \"Do you need an invitation to sit down, too?\" she asked, thinking Sarah Beth would never believe any of this. Not that she would ever tell her! \"No, dear,\" Brenna said, taking a seat on the sofa, \"but it is good manners.\" Roshan sat on the sofa beside his wife. Cara sat beside her father, leaving Vince to take the chair. \"Is there anything else I need to know about your... uh, lifestyle?\" Cara asked. She frowned, thinking about all the old vampire movies she had seen. Her parents didn\u0027t seem anything like the ravening monsters portrayed on film. Her mother and father exchanged glances. Cara wondered if they were communicating with each other somehow, saying things only they could hear. She had a feeling they were deciding how much to tell her and how much to keep secret. After a moment, her father said, \"Most of what people believe about vampires is false. The truths are that silver burns our skin, we can pass unnoticed among humans if we wish, we are capable of changing our shapes, and we cast no reflection in a mirror.\" Cara stared at her father. Funny she\u0027d never noticed that the only mirrors in her parents home had been the ones in her own room. Now that she thought of it, she realized that the drapes had always been drawn across the windows, as well. Her mother loved jewelry, but none of it was silver. Cara glanced at Vince. Did he find this conversation as bizarre as she did? He smiled at her, his expression impassive. She took a deep breath. She didn\u0027t want to talk about vampires anymore, so, to change the subject, she said, \"We went to the hospital to see Frank, but they said he\u0027d gone home.\" Her mother and father exchanged looks again. It was obvious they understood why she had changed the subject. \"Frank\u0027s resting comfortably,\" her father said. \"He asked me to thank you for the flowers and the candy, and to tell you that he would be back on the job on Monday.\" Now you see why we wanted you to have a bodyguard. Though her father didn\u0027t say the words aloud, Cara could almost hear them hanging, unspoken, in the air. \"I\u0027m glad he\u0027s going to be all right,\" she said, \"though I can\u0027t understand how he could recover so quickly.\" Vince glanced at Roshan, but said nothing. \"Some people have remarkable recuperative powers,\" Brenna said to fill the silence. She glanced around. \"I love what you\u0027ve done with your new place. It suits you.\" Cara smiled, thinking Vince had said the same thing. \"Would you like to see the rest? It\u0027s not very big, but I like it.\" \"Of course,\" Brenna said. \"Are you coming, Roshan?\" \"In a minute, love.\" He waited until his wife and daughter had left the room, then focused his attention on the other man. \"Just how serious are you about my daughter?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-touch-children-of-the-night-2/page-25.html","bookId":2300,"book":{"id":2300,"title":"Night\u0027s Touch (Children of The Night #2)","description":"Storyline: Night\u0027s Touch (Children of The Night #2) One kiss can seal your fate...
