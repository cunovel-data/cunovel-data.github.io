She had told the sergeant in charge that she and Vince had been out for a walk when they heard a baby crying in the park and that they had found the infant wrapped in a blanket on a bench. The police had asked numerous questions, but no matter what the question, Cara had given them the same answer: \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n The sergeant had asked them to wait while he made a phone call, and ten minutes later, a man and a woman, both clad in pajamas, bathrobes, and slippers, ran into the station. They had taken one look at the baby and dissolved in tears of joy. They had showered Cara and Vince with hugs and fervent words of thanks. They had offered them a reward, which Cara refused.\\n\\n Finally, after more questions, the police had decided Cara and Vince didn\u0027t have anything to do with the kidnapping and, after taking their names, addresses, and phone numbers, had let them go.\\n\\n Though she knew it was foolish, Cara felt bereft, her arms empty as she left the police station. She had held the baby only a short time, but holding the infant had made her yearn for a child of her own, a little girl with Vince\u0027s black hair and deep brown eyes.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re awfully quiet,\" Vince remarked as he braked for a stoplight. \"Are you worried about your father?\"\\n\\n \"Not really. He\u0027s a vampire, after all,\" she said with a forced laugh. \"I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll be all right.\"\\n\\n Vince glanced out the window. It had been a long night; it would be dawn soon. \"What\u0027s bothering you then?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll think it\u0027s silly.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe, but tell me anyway.\"\\n\\n \"Holding that baby suddenly made me want one of my own.\" She looked up at him. \"Do you like kids?\"\\n\\n \"Sure. I always wanted a big family.\"\\n\\n \"Wanted?\"\\n\\n Thinking quickly, he said, \"I\u0027m not sure big families are practical these days.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe not.\"\\n\\n Cara snuggled against Vince, her head resting on his shoulder. Frank hadn\u0027t been at his house, so they had taken one of her father\u0027s cars and driven to the police station without him. With a sigh, she closed her eyes. It had been a long, nerve-racking night. Replaying everything in her mind, she knew she was lucky to be alive.\\n\\n \"Where do you think Anton went?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"And that creature...\" She sat up, her adrenaline flowing. \"It\u0027s out there somewhere.\"\\n\\n Vince put his arm around her and drew her against him once again. \"Don\u0027t worry about it now. That thing has no reason to come after you.\"\\n\\n \"But...\"\\n\\n \"Shh, darlin\u0027, you\u0027re safe here with me,\" he said, though he, too, had been wondering where the creature had gone and what it might do. Did it have any memory of its former life? Would it go through the city, wreaking havoc, like the zombies in horror movies? How long would the incantation last? A day? A week? Would the enchantment dissipate on its own, or would it have to be broken, and if so, how?\\n\\n He was still pondering those things when he pulled up in front of DeLongpre\u0027s house. The place was dark save for a light in one of the windows downstairs.\\n\\n Brenna opened the passenger-side door almost before the car came to a stop. \"Is everything all right?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, although for a while I thought we were going to be spending the night in jail,\" Cara muttered.\\n\\n \"Honestly, do I look like a kidnapper to you?\"\\n\\n \"Of course not,\" Brenna said, smothering a grin.\\n\\n \"How\u0027s Dad?\" Cara asked, following her mother into the house.\\n\\n \"Resting. He\u0027ll be fine in a few days.\"\\n\\n \"Can I see him?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s not here.\"\\n\\n Cara\u0027s eyes widened. \"Where is he?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s resting where he won\u0027t be disturbed.\"\\n\\n \"But...\"\\n\\n \"No more questions tonight, dear,\" Brenna said. \"You need to get some rest. Frank\u0027s in the kitchen. He\u0027ll be staying in the house tonight.\"\\n\\n \"Where was he?\" Cara asked. \"We went by his place, but he wasn\u0027t there.\"\\n\\n \"He was out taking care of a few loose ends,\" Brenna said, her eyes twinkling. \"Vince, you\u0027re welcome to stay, too, if you like.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you, but I\u0027d best be getting home.\"\\n\\n Cara squeezed his hand. \"I wish you\u0027d stay.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got a few things to do, but I\u0027ll see you tomorrow. Promise me you won\u0027t go anywhere alone.\"\\n\\n \"Promise me you\u0027ll still be here tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"I promise. Now you.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry, I won\u0027t go anywhere.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s my girl,\" he said with a wink. He looked at Brenna. \"If there\u0027s anything I can do...\"\\n\\n \"Could I see you for a moment, alone?\" Brenna asked.\\n\\n \"Sure.\" He followed Brenna outside and waited while she closed the door. \"Is something wrong?\"\\n\\n \"Have you told Cara the truth yet?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been meaning to, but...\" Vince shrugged. \"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ll lose her.\"\\n\\n \"The longer you put if off, the harder it will be,\" Brenna said. \"Believe me, I know.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m surprised you haven\u0027t told her.\"\\n\\n \"Her father already did,\" Brenna reminded him, \"but she didn\u0027t believe it. Maybe she just doesn\u0027t want to believe it.\"\\n\\n Unable to think of a suitable reply, he remained silent.\\n\\n Brenna regarded him curiously for a moment. \"You\u0027re different from the rest of us, aren\u0027t you? Roshan says it\u0027s because Mara brought you across. He said you aren\u0027t trapped by the Dark Sleep, and you don\u0027t seem overwhelmed by the need for blood, the way most new vampires are.\"\\n\\n Vince shrugged. \"Sometimes I don\u0027t feel like a vampire, either, but I\u0027m vampire enough to know I can\u0027t live with my family and expect them not to notice the changes in me.\"\\n\\n \"I want you to promise me that you\u0027ll tell Cara the truth before things go any further between you,\"\\n\\n Brenna said, and then paused, her eyes narrowing. \"Things have already gone too far, haven\u0027t they?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll have to ask Cara about that,\" Vince said.\\n\\n Brenna shook her head. \"You\u0027re going to break her heart; you know that, don\u0027t you?\" She blew out a sigh. \"At least you can\u0027t get her pregnant.\" Squaring her shoulders, she took a deep, calming breath. \"I want to thank you for your help tonight, and...\"\\n\\n She turned as the door opened and Cara stepped out on the porch. \"What\u0027s going on out here?\" she asked, looking from Vince to her mother.\\n\\n \"Nothing, dear, I was just thanking Vince for his help.\"\\n\\n \"And you had to come out here for that?\"\\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t anyone ever tell you what happened to the curious cat?\" Vince asked, tweaking her nose.\\n\\n \"Anyway, it\u0027s late and I should go.\"\\n\\n Drawing Cara into his arms, he kissed her; mindful that her mother was watching, he didn\u0027t make the kiss as long or as deep as he would have liked.\\n\\n \"Sweet dreams, darlin\u0027.\" He gave her a quick hug and a wink before letting her go.\\n\\n With a nod in Brenna\u0027s direction, Vince descended the porch stairs.\\n\\n He paused a moment, and then he walked the perimeter of the grounds before settling down in the shadows to keep watch until the sun came up.\\n\\n The creature wandered aimlessly through the night, its mind as dark as the sky overhead. Now and then it saw something that looked fleetingly familiar, but before he could make sense of it, the memory was gone.\\n\\n Keeping to the shadows, the creature lumbered up one street and down another until it came to a large house located on a hill. A high wrought-iron fence surrounded the yard. No lights shone in the windows.\\n\\n The creature stood there for a long time. There was something oddly familiar about the house, something that drew it up the hill, through the gate, and up the stairs to the front porch. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-touch-children-of-the-night-2/page-34.html","bookId":2300,"book":{"id":2300,"title":"Night\u0027s Touch (Children of The Night #2)","description":"Storyline: Night\u0027s Touch (Children of The Night #2) \\n One kiss can seal your fate... \\n Cara DeLongpre wandered into the mysterious Nocturne club looking for a fleeting diversion from her sheltered life.
