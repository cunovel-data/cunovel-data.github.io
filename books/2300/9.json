As always, he was amazed to have her in his life. He had never expected to have a daughter, had resigned himself to being childless, and then she had come into his life, enriching it beyond measure. The thought of losing her was beyond bearing.\\n\\n \"What were you thinking?\" he asked quietly. \"Going off into the woods with some man you don\u0027t even know? Merciful heavens, Cara, don\u0027t you ever listen to the news? It seems like every other night there\u0027s a story about some girl who\u0027s disappeared!\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure none of them had bodyguards, Daddy!\"\\n\\n \"Di Giorgio said you were out of his sight for a short time. It only takes a minute to snuff out a life.\"\\n\\n Cara stared at her father. His eyes had gone hard and flat, and he spoke with such conviction that she might have thought he had taken a life or two himself if she hadn\u0027t known better. \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n Taking a step forward, Roshan placed his hand on her shoulder. \"I\u0027m sorry, too, Princess. I don\u0027t mean to scold. I know you\u0027re a big girl now. But you\u0027re also a beautiful girl, and men have been taking advantage of beautiful young girls since time began.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t mean to worry you, but, oh, Daddy, I like him so much!\"\\n\\n \"Which one is this? The one who drives the BMW or the one who drives the Mustang? Or someone new?\"\\n\\n \"The one who drives the Mustang, Dad. His name is Vince, and he owns a garage over on Seventh Street and...\"\\n\\n \"And you can\u0027t think about anything but him.\"\\n\\n Cara smiled up at her father. \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Sounds a little like love to me, Princess,\" Roshan replied, and felt a sudden ache deep in his heart. This was the first time he\u0027d seen that look in her eye or heard the excitement of first love in her voice. He had always known the day would come when another man would appear to take her away from him. Was this the man?\\n\\n \"Does it? Was that how it was for you with Mom? Did you know, the very first time you saw her, that she was the one?\"\\n\\n Roshan nodded. He had been on the verge of destroying himself when he fell in love with Brenna Flanagan\u0027s picture. His need to know more about her, to find out who she was and where she had lived and how she had died, had become his sole reason for survival. She had quite literally saved his life. Ah, Brenna, was there ever another woman like her? She had given him a reason to go on living. She had given him a daughter...\\n\\n He stroked Cara\u0027s cheek. \"Are we going to meet this young man?\"\\n\\n \"Do you want to?\"\\n\\n What he wanted to do was send the man far away, erase him from Cara\u0027s mind. He wasn\u0027t ready for his daughter to leave home, didn\u0027t think he would ever be ready, but it was the way of the world and so, with a smile, he said, \"I think so.\"\\n\\n \"When?\"\\n\\n \"Preferably before the wedding,\" he said dryly.\\n\\n \"Oh, Daddy!\" She gave him a playful punch on the arm. \"We aren\u0027t getting married. I hardly know him.\\n\\n We\u0027re just... you know, friends. How did you and Mom meet?\"\\n\\n \"The first time I saw your mother, she was dancing. I took one look and I was smitten...\"\\n\\n \"Smitten! Oh, Daddy, how melodramatic.\"\\n\\n \"But true, nonetheless. I saw her and I knew I had to have her.\"\\n\\n \"Smitten.\" Cara shook her head. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever heard anyone actually use that word. Did Mom feel the same about you?\"\\n\\n \"Not at first, but I soon won her over.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not surprised.\"\\n\\n \"No?\"\\n\\n \"Of course not. You\u0027re very sexy. For an old man,\" she added with a grin.\\n\\n Old, he thought. She had no idea. \"So, when do we get to meet this new man in your life?\"\\n\\n She started to say Sunday, then remembered that she had a date with Anton and no way to contact him so she could break it, although she might be able to get in touch with him by calling his mother\u0027s bookstore. She frowned thoughtfully. She had no way to get in touch with Vince, either, unless she went by the garage. \"I\u0027ll talk to Vince and get back to you.\"\\n\\n \"All right.\" Leaning forward, he kissed her cheek. \"Good night, Princess.\"\\n\\n \"Night, Dad.\"\\n\\n Roshan blew out a sigh as his daughter left the room. If centuries of experience had taught him anything, it was that nothing stayed the same, but this was one change he wasn\u0027t looking forward to. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-touch-children-of-the-night-2/page-9.html","bookId":2300,"book":{"id":2300,"title":"Night\u0027s Touch (Children of The Night #2)","description":"Storyline: Night\u0027s Touch (Children of The Night #2) \\n One kiss can seal your fate... \\n Cara DeLongpre wandered into the mysterious Nocturne club looking for a fleeting diversion from her sheltered life.
