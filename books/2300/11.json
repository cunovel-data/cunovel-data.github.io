{"id":93974,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"Cara slept late Saturday morning, her dreams troubled. First she was dancing at The Nocturne with Anton, then she was making out with Vince while Anton and her father watched. In the distance, a woman danced naked under a full moon, and standing behind the woman was another man. She couldn\u0027t see his face but evil poured out of him like thick black smoke. It engulfed the woman, then snaked along the ground, licking at Anton\u0027s ankles. Terror held her in place as the smoke\u0027s cold black breath drew closer. She had to get away! If the smoke touched her, she would die! She tried to scream but no sound emerged from her throat. Eerie laughter rose from the midst of the smoke. She looked to her father for help but he seemed unaware of the danger. She had to get away! Heart pounding, she opened her mouth, terror releasing the scream that had been trapped in her throat...\\n\\n And woke to the sound of her own screams ringing in her ears.\\n\\n Sitting up, she glanced around, relieved to find herself in her own room, in her own bed. She was relieved that it had only been a nightmare, though it had been the most realistic nightmare she\u0027d ever had. For some reason, a nightmare she\u0027d had as a child popped into her mind. It was a dream she remembered clearly, even after all these years. In her dream, she had gone into her parents\u0027 bedroom early in the morning and climbed into bed between them. She had tried to awaken them, but they hadn\u0027t moved, hadn\u0027t been breathing. Terrified to think that they were dead, she had run back to her own room and pulled the covers over her head. When she told her father about it later, he had assured her that it had only been a dream, but for the longest time, she had been convinced it had actually happened.\\n\\n But dreams were dreams and couldn\u0027t hurt you. Shaking off the last vestiges of her nightmare, she got out of bed and headed for the bathroom.\\n\\n She felt better when she emerged from her shower fifteen minutes later, her hair freshly washed. She dried her hair, applied her makeup, pulled on a pair of jeans and a sweater. She stripped the sheets from her bed, carried them downstairs, and put them in the wash.\\n\\n As usual, the house was clean and quiet. She went into the kitchen in search of food, but she wasn\u0027t really hungry, so she opted for tea and toast.\\n\\n When she finished eating, she washed her dishes, then sat at the kitchen table, wondering what to do the rest of the day. Cara usually worked on Saturday, but the library was closed today while the floors were being refinished and wouldn\u0027t open again until Tuesday.\\n\\n Maybe she would drive into town and take in an early movie, or maybe she would go shopping-not that she needed anything. She had enough clothes and shoes to outfit a dozen women. Still, she liked shopping... and one of her favorite stores was located on Seventh Street, only a few blocks from Vince\u0027s garage.\\n\\n Happiness bubbled up inside her at the thought of seeing him again. Before she could talk herself out of it, Cara grabbed her keys and her handbag and hurried out the door.\\n\\n Di Giorgio\u0027s car followed her down the driveway.\\n\\n She had butterflies in her stomach when she pulled up in front of Vince\u0027s garage. It was a large corner building, with the entrance on Seventh Street. She sat there a moment, wondering if he would be happy to see her. Maybe he wouldn\u0027t like her dropping in unannounced when he was working. Well, there was only one way to find out.\\n\\n Taking the keys from the ignition, she got out of the car. There was a side door that led to an office. The door was closed. She discovered it was locked when she tried to open it. Maybe he was in the garage.\\n\\n She walked around the corner to where the service bays were, but this door was closed, too. Perhaps he didn\u0027t work on Saturdays, or maybe he was out picking up car parts or out to lunch.\\n\\n Shoulders slumped in disappointment, she returned to her car. She waved at Di Giorgio as she slid behind the wheel, then drove to her favorite dress shop where she picked out a slinky black dress for her next date with Vince, whenever that might be, and a pretty pink silk dress to wear Sunday night.\\n\\n She drove by the garage again when she finished shopping, but it was still locked up tight. Heaving a sigh of disappointment, she motioned for Di Giorgio to pull up beside her.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m bored,\" she said. \"Do you want to go to a movie?\"\\n\\n \"Whatever you want, Miss DeLongpre.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, come on. I\u0027ll buy the popcorn.\"\\n\\n It was dusk when Cara returned home. The sound of the upstairs shower told her that her parents were awake.\\n\\n She tossed her handbag and packages on the sofa, then went into the kitchen. She had stopped at her favorite Italian restaurant on the way home. She didn\u0027t like eating out of the take-home containers, so she transferred the lasagna to a plate, along with a couple of bread sticks, grabbed a soda from the fridge, and sat down to eat.\\n\\n As usual of late, her thoughts turned to Vince. She had driven by his garage again after the movie, but he hadn\u0027t been there.\\n\\n She was rinsing off her dishes when her mother entered the kitchen.\\n\\n \"Hi, Mom.\"\\n\\n \"Hello, darling. How was your day?\"\\n\\n \"It was okay. I went shopping and then Frank and I went to the movies.\"\\n\\n \"And what did you buy?\"\\n\\n \"A couple of dresses. Wanna see?\"\\n\\n \"Of course.\"\\n\\n Going into the living room, Cara opened the boxes and held up each dress in turn. \"What do you think?\"\\n\\n \"I think that black one could get you into all kinds of trouble,\" Brenna said. She motioned for Cara to come and sit beside her. \"Your father tells me you\u0027re in love.\"\\n\\n \"I might be.\"\\n\\n \"Does he make your heart sing? Do you think about him every minute of the day?\"\\n\\n Cara nodded.\\n\\n \"Dream of him at night?\"\\n\\n Cara nodded again, and then frowned, remembering the horrible dream she\u0027d had the night before.\\n\\n \"I hope we get to meet him soon.\"\\n\\n \"Me, too.\"\\n\\n \"Be careful, sweetheart. Don\u0027t go too fast. Do you know what I mean?\"\\n\\n \"Mom, I\u0027m a big girl. I don\u0027t need a lecture on sex.\"\\n\\n Brenna took Cara\u0027s hand in hers and gave it a squeeze. \"I guess I should have given it to you sooner.\\n\\n You just grew up so fast.\" She shrugged. \"I just don\u0027t want you to get hurt.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\" Cara kissed her mother on the cheek. \"Thanks, Mom.\"\\n\\n \"Your father and I are going out for a walk,\" Brenna said. \"We won\u0027t be long. Are you going out tonight?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\\n\\n \"All right, dear. We\u0027ll be back soon. Maybe we can play cards or something.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\"\\n\\n Brenna hugged her daughter, then left the room. Roshan was waiting for her by the front door.\\n\\n Outside, Brenna and Roshan moved quickly and silently through the shadows. The downtown district was always a good place to hunt. As usual, they chose a young couple, took what they needed, and sent the pair on their way.\\n\\n \"Cara\u0027s growing up,\" Brenna remarked as they strolled back toward home.\\n\\n \"I think she\u0027s grown,\" Roshan said dryly.\\n\\n \"I guess I mean she\u0027s maturing, changing. I can feel her distancing herself from us. I don\u0027t like it.\"\\n\\n Roshan put his arm around his wife\u0027s shoulders and gave her a squeeze. \"I don\u0027t, either, but there\u0027s nothing we can do about it.\" He wasn\u0027t sure what he would do to the man she fell in love with. The thought of any man taking her away... He knew it was the natural way of things, for a young woman to marry and leave home. He just wasn\u0027t sure he could allow it.\\n\\n \"Do you think we\u0027ve been good parents?\" Brenna asked. \"Did I make a mistake, bringing her home all those years ago?\"\\n\\n \"Here now, stop that. We\u0027ve raised a beautiful, well-adjusted daughter. She\u0027s smart and resourceful, and...\"\\n\\n \"But she doesn\u0027t really have any friends except for Sarah Beth. A young girl should have friends.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe it\u0027s time we let her invite people to the house.\"\\n\\n Brenna\u0027s eyes widened. \"Do you think that\u0027s wise?\"\\n\\n \"Our lair is secure. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything to fear.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe you\u0027re right. Maybe we\u0027ve been overly protective of her for nothing.\" She smiled up at him. \"I want to share every moment we can with her, while we can.\"\\n\\n Cara was surprised by her parents\u0027 announcement. \"But why the sudden change?\" she asked, unable to believe what she was hearing.\\n\\n \"Your mother and I have decided we were being selfish, refusing to let you invite your friends over.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s great, Mom. Dad.\" She hugged them both. Of course, she didn\u0027t really have any friends her age except for Sarah Beth. Most of the friends she\u0027d had in high school had moved away or she had lost touch with them. Still, it was nice to know she could bring company home if the occasion ever arose.\\n\\n Company like Vince...\\n\\n They were about to sit down and play Canasta when the doorbell rang. Roshan looked at Cara. \"Are you expecting someone?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n Looking thoughtful, he went to answer the door.\\n\\n Vince rang the bell again, thinking this was probably the stupidest thing he had ever done, but he had been yearning to see Cara since he woke that evening and the yearning had only grown stronger.\\n\\n He fought down a sudden sense of panic as the door opened.\\n\\n The vampire who answered the door was tall and lean with powerful shoulders and long limbs. His hair was as black as the ace of spades, his eyes a bold midnight blue set beneath straight black brows. His skin was pale though not sickly looking-more like that of a healthy man who didn\u0027t spend a lot of time in the sun. Preternatural power rolled off him in waves. Coming here suddenly seemed like a really bad idea.\\n\\n \"Who are you?\" the vampire asked. \"What are you doing here?\"\\n\\n Vince squared his shoulders and thrust out his chin.\\n\\n He had the feeling the man could squash him with a \u0027 look. It wasn\u0027t a feeling he liked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m Vince,\" he said, his tone more belligerent than he had intended. \"I came to see Cara.\"\\n\\n \"Is my daughter expecting you?\"\\n\\n \"No.\" Damn, Vince thought, he\u0027d been right. The vampire was her father.\\n\\n Roshan glanced over his shoulder to find Cara standing behind him, her eyes wide. Roshan swore under his breath. Of all the bad luck! He had no sooner told the girl she could have guests than one came calling, and not just any guest, but a vampire! And not just any vampire, but the one whose presence he had sensed before, the one who had been in Cara\u0027s room. He looked at his daughter, his eyes narrowing.\\n\\n Was there more going on here than Cara had told him? Did she know Vince was Nosferatu?\\n\\n \"Roshan?\" Brenna called, coming up behind him, \"what\u0027s going...\" She came to an abrupt halt, her gaze moving quickly between her husband and the young man standing on the doorstep. \"What\u0027s going on?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing,\" Roshan replied curtly. \"Cara has a visitor.\"\\n\\n \"Mom, Dad, this is Vince Cordova,\" Cara said, smiling as she moved toward the door. \"I told you about him.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, dear,\" Brenna murmured.\\n\\n \"Is something wrong?\" Cara asked. She looked from her parents to Vince and back again. Tension crackled in the air. It crawled over her skin like the tickle of static electricity, though she could find no reason for it.\\n\\n \"Cara, I should like a few minutes alone with your young man,\" Roshan said, his gaze still resting on Vince\u0027s face. \"We\u0027ll join you shortly.\"\\n\\n \"Dad...\"\\n\\n \"Come, Cara,\" Brenna said, and taking her daughter by the hand, she led her into the other room.\\n\\n Roshan stepped out onto the front porch and closed the door behind him. He was immediately struck by the power of the young man standing in front of him. Though the man was young in the life, he exuded the strength of a much older vampire. Such power could only be passed on by the ancient ones. \"Who made you?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t remember her name. It was kind of hit-and-run, if you know what I mean?\"\\n\\n \"Was it Mara?\"\\n\\n Vince frowned. The name sounded familiar, but so much of that night was hazy in his mind \"It might have been,\" he allowed. \"Does it matter?\"\\n\\n Mara, of course, Roshan thought. She was the oldest of their kind, a law unto herself. No one knew how old she was, when she had been made, or who had made her. There was speculation that she had been made in the valley of the Nile during the reign of Cleopatra. It was said that she was truly immortal, that she was impervious to blade or stake, and, perhaps most amazing of all, that the sun no longer had any power over her.\\n\\n \"What are you doing here, in my town?\" Roshan asked.\\n\\n \"Your town?\"\\n\\n \"My town.\"\\n\\n Vince shrugged. \"I was passing through, saw it, liked it. You got a problem with that?\"\\n\\n \"As a rule, I don\u0027t allow other vampires to reside in my territory, especially disrespectful young punks who don\u0027t ask my permission to stay.\"\\n\\n \"Well, pardon me all to hell. I didn\u0027t know I had to ask.\"\\n\\n \"Mind your manners, whelp. You\u0027ve been one of us less than a year. You still have a lot to learn.\"\\n\\n \"How do you know that?\"\\n\\n \"I know a lot of things,\" Roshan retorted dryly. \"I\u0027ve been a vampire for over three hundred years.\"\\n\\n \"No shit.\"\\n\\n \"Have you no respect for your elders?\"\\n\\n Vince blew out a sigh. His mother would be ashamed of him if she saw him now. He was a little ashamed himself. One thing was for certain, he wasn\u0027t making a good impression on Cara\u0027s father.\\n\\n Meeting the other man\u0027s eyes, Vince muttered, \"I\u0027m sorry. Sir. I was out of line.\"\\n\\n Roshan grunted softly. \"What do you want with my daughter?\"\\n\\n \"Not what you think.\"\\n\\n \"No?\" Roshan\u0027s gaze burned into Vince\u0027s. \"What were you doing in her room the other night?\"\\n\\n \"Not what you\u0027re thinking!\" Vince said emphatically.\\n\\n Roshan\u0027s gaze bored into him, as if seeking the truth of his words.\\n\\n \"Dammit, we didn\u0027t do anything but talk.\"\\n\\n \"She doesn\u0027t know what you are, does she?\" Roshan asked.\\n\\n \"No.\" Vince canted his head to one side. \"She doesn\u0027t know what you are, either, does she?\" He laughed softly. \"I won\u0027t tell on you if you don\u0027t blow the whistle on me,\" he said, then frowned. \"If you\u0027re over three hundred years old, she can\u0027t be your natural daughter.\" He still had a lot to learn about being a vampire, Vince mused, but if there was one thing he knew, it was that vampires couldn\u0027t create life.\\n\\n \"I want you to leave town,\" Roshan said. \"Now. Tonight.\"\\n\\n \"And if I don\u0027t?\" Vince lifted his chin and squared his shoulders, refusing to be cowed. He had come here to see Cara and, by damn, he was going to see her!\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll destroy you.\"\\n\\n \"Then do your worst, \u0027cause I\u0027m not leaving. I\u0027m in love with your daughter.\"\\n\\n \"And you\u0027re willing to die for her?\"\\n\\n \"For her, with her, whatever.\"\\n\\n In spite of himself, Roshan found himself admiring the young vampire\u0027s grit. \"You\u0027ll bring her nothing but heartache.\"\\n\\n \"Shouldn\u0027t that be her decision?\"\\n\\n \"If you hurt her...\"\\n\\n Vince held up his hands in a gesture of surrender. \"I know, you\u0027ll destroy me.\"\\n\\n \"Without a qualm,\" Roshan said, though, if it came down to that, he wondered if he would emerge the victor. Though Cordova was young in the life, he exuded the power and arrogance of a much older vampire. Roshan held the younger man\u0027s gaze for stretched seconds and then, with a sigh of resignation, said, \"Shall we go in?\"\\n\\n Cara was pacing the entry hall when her father entered the house. She felt relieved to see that her father hadn\u0027t scared Vince away. She couldn\u0027t keep her eyes off Vince as he walked toward her. He looked as handsome as sin in a pair of Levi\u0027s, a black T-shirt, and a dark sports jacket.\\n\\n \"We were about to play Canasta, Mr. Cordova,\" Brenna remarked. \"Would you care to join us?\"\\n\\n \"Sure. And it\u0027s Vince.\"\\n\\n \"Brenna,\" she said, smiling.\\n\\n The atmosphere at the table was, to say the least, strained. At least it was between Cara\u0027s father and Vince. The tension was so thick between them, it was almost tangible. Cara had expected her father to be suspicious of any man she brought home, but this went way beyond that.\\n\\n After a few hands, she asked Vince if he wanted a coke. When he declined, her father suggested a little red wine.\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" Vince said, \"that sounds good.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll have some, too,\" Brenna said with a smile. She turned to Vince. \"So, tell us about yourself, won\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s not much to tell,\" he replied good-naturedly.\\n\\n \"Have you been here long?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Where are you from originally?\"\\n\\n \"Georgia.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, a southern boy,\" Brenna said, laughing softly.\\n\\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\"\\n\\n \"Do you come from a large family?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got three brothers and a sister and about a dozen nieces and nephews.\"\\n\\n \"And a cat,\" Cara added.\\n\\n Vince grinned at her. \"And a cat.\"\\n\\n \"Your family sounds wonderful. I would have liked to have a large family,\" Brenna said wistfully. \"But it never happened.\" She smiled at Cara. \"I\u0027m hoping for lots of grandchildren.\"\\n\\n \"Mom!\"\\n\\n \"Cara tells me you\u0027re a mechanic,\" Roshan said, returning to the table with four glasses and a bottle of wine.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right. You got a car that needs fixin\u0027?\"\\n\\n \"Not at the moment. How are things going?\" After opening the bottle, Roshan filled a glass and handed it to Brenna.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m doing all right,\" Vince said with a shrug.\\n\\n \"Are we going to play cards, or are you two going to give Vince the third degree all night?\" Cara asked.\\n\\n \"You can hardly blame us for being curious,\" Brenna said. \"After all, this is the first young man who\u0027s come calling.\"\\n\\n \"Mom!\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I\u0027m sorry, dear, was that a secret?\"\\n\\n Vince tried not to laugh, but he couldn\u0027t help it. The look of horror on Cara\u0027s face was priceless. He couldn\u0027t blame her parents for being curious about him. After all, he was dating their only daughter, and he was a vampire. He wasn\u0027t sure if that was a good thing in their eyes or not.\\n\\n Roshan filled the other three wineglasses and resumed his seat.\\n\\n Cara simply sat there, mortified by her mother\u0027s reference to grandchildren. What must Vince be thinking, and why had she ever thought having friends over would be a good idea?\\n\\n At midnight, Vince took his leave.\\n\\n Cara walked him to the door, then followed him outside. \"I\u0027m sorry about that,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Nothing to be sorry for. They\u0027re just looking out for you.\"\\n\\n \"I guess so.\"\\n\\n Vince slid his arms around her waist and pulled her close. \"I do think I deserve a reward, though.\"\\n\\n \"Do you?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am. I was on my very best behavior all night long. I think at the very least I deserve a good-night kiss.\"\\n\\n She swayed toward him. \"Do you?\" She was smiling now. She had never openly flirted with a man before, let alone one that was as handsome and sexy as Vince. It was a heady experience.\\n\\n \"Uh-huh. Do I need to ask daddy\u0027s permission?\"\\n\\n \"No, silly, just kiss me.\"\\n\\n Grinning, he lowered his head and claimed her lips with his. She tasted of sunshine and honey and warm summer days that were forever lost to him. She was love\u0027s first kiss and a baby\u0027s first cry, spring\u0027s first flower and presents on Christmas morning. He drew her closer, wanting to lose himself in her sweetness, to feel the heat of her skin against his own, to explore all the subtle curves and valleys of her body.\\n\\n But this was not the time, and definitely not the place. Not with her father on the other side of the door.\\n\\n Vince kissed her again, long and deep, savoring the taste of the wine on her lips before he moved away.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d better go. Can I see you tomorrow night?\"\\n\\n She started to say yes, and then remembered that Anton was coming to call. \"I\u0027m sorry, I\u0027ve got a... a date.\"\\n\\n \"Ah.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, I made it before we... a while ago.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s all right.\" He gave her a last, quick kiss. \"I\u0027ll see you soon.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-touch-children-of-the-night-2/page-11.html","bookId":2300,"book":{"id":2300,"title":"Night\u0027s Touch (Children of The Night #2)","description":"Storyline: Night\u0027s Touch (Children of The Night #2) \\n One kiss can seal your fate... \\n Cara DeLongpre wandered into the mysterious Nocturne club looking for a fleeting diversion from her sheltered life.
