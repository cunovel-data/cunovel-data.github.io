{"id":110295,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"Sleeping with my therapist was a bad idea. I knew it too, but I couldn\u0027t really help it. There were only so many times I could hear \"Why don\u0027t you explain that\" and \"Tell me how you feel.\" So, I finally snapped and decided to show the guy how I felt. I\u0027ve gotta say, for a decent guy who had never cheated on his wife, he wasn\u0027t that hard to take advantage of. And by \"not hard,\" I mean \"ridiculously easy.\" His pseudo morals gave me a strong succubus energy fix, and when you consider that what we did was probably the most productive thing that ever took place on his couch, it was almost like I did a good deed. Still, I knew my boss was going to be pissed, seeing as he was the one who\u0027d ordered me to seek counseling in the first place. \"Do not tell Jerome,\" I warned my friends, tapping my cigarette against the ashtray. \"I don\u0027t want to deal with that kind of fallout.\" My friends and I were sitting at a booth in Cold July, an industrial club down in Seattle\u0027s Belltown district. The place was dark and loud, with crisscrossing pipes on the walls and ceiling forming the bulk of the d¨¦cor. Because it was a private club, it didn\u0027t have to adhere to the city\u0027s public smoking ban, which was a perk for me. In the last few months, I\u0027d found nicotine was one of the essential things helping me cope. Other things on the essential list: vodka, Nine Inch Nails, a steady supply of moral men, and an all-purpose bitchy attitude. \"Look, Georgina,\" said my friend Hugh. He was an imp, a type of hellish legal assistant who bought souls for our masters and did assorted middle-management tasks. He had dark-cropped hair and was big without being fat. \"I\u0027m no expert in mental health, but I\u0027m going to go out on a limb here and say that probably wasn\u0027t a helpful step on the road to healing.\" I shrugged and let my eyes scan the crowded room for potential victims. There were some pretty good pickings here. \"Well, he wasn\u0027t that good. At therapy, I mean. Besides, I don\u0027t think I need it anymore.\" Silence met me, inasmuch as silence could meet me in a place so noisy. I turned back to my friends. Hugh was making no pretense of hiding his you\u0027re fucking crazy look. Our vampire friends, Peter and Cody, at least had the decency to avert their eyes. I narrowed mine and put out the cigarette. \"I don\u0027t suppose,\" said Peter at last, \"that this is anybody you\u0027d maybe, uh, like to date long term?\" \"Yeah,\" agreed Cody, eyes wide and hopeful. \"I bet a therapist would be a great listener. And you wouldn\u0027t even have to pay for it.\" \"My insurance pays for it,\" I snapped. \"And I don\u0027t really appreciate your passive-aggressive attitude about my boyfriend.\" \"It\u0027s not that passive,\" said Hugh. \"You could do better, sweetie.\" \"The guy\u0027s corrupt and going to Hell. How is this a problem for you? And you didn\u0027t like my last boyfriend either. Maybe you should stop worrying about my love life and go back to figuring out how to get your latest secretary into bed.\" In what had to be a weird twist of the universe, none of my friends liked my current boyfriend, a dark magician named Dante. Dante\u0027s morals were pretty nonexistent, and he owned stock in bitterness and cynicism. That would make you think he\u0027d fit in perfectly with this group of damned souls, but for whatever reason, he didn\u0027t. \"You aren\u0027t meant to be with someone bad,\" said Cody. We were all immortal now but were considered \"lesser immortals.\" That meant we had once been human before selling our souls into Hell\u0027s service. Cody was young compared to the rest of us in our little circle. Hugh claimed almost a century. Peter and I had millennia. As such, there was almost a na\u0026iuml;vet¨¦ about Cody, a charming idealism that rivaled the kind I used to have. It had been shattered when my previous boyfriend, a human named Seth, had left me for a friend of mine. Seth was a good soul, quiet and infinitely kind. He\u0027d made me believe in better things, like that maybe there was hope for a succubus like me. I\u0027d thought I was in love-no, I had been in love. Even I could admit that. But as a succubus, I brought a dangerous element to any relationship. When I had sex with a guy (or a girl-it worked either way), I stole their life energy, which was the power that fueled every human soul. It kept me alive and sustained my immortal existence. The purer the guy, the more energy I took. The more energy I took, the more I shortened his life. With Dante, I had almost no effect. He had little energy to give, so our sex life was relatively \"safe,\" and I therefore sought my fixes from meaningless guys on the side. With Seth...well, that had been a different story. Sleeping with him would have had very detrimental effects-so I\u0027d refused to do it. For a while, we\u0027d lived on love alone, our relationship being about a lot more than a physical act. Over time, however, that had taken its toll, as had a number of simple relationship complications. Things had finally blown up when Seth had slept with my friend Maddie. I think he\u0027d done it to encourage me to break up, hoping to spare me future pain. Whatever the initial intent, he and Maddie had actually gone on to establish a fairly serious relationship in the following months. I hadn\u0027t taken that very well. \"There\u0027s no pleasing you guys,\" I growled, beckoning the waiter for another drink. He ignored me, irritating me further. \"You don\u0027t like good ones. You don\u0027t like bad ones. What the fuck does it take?\" A new voice suddenly cut into our circle. \"Please tell me we\u0027re discussing your romantic hijinks, Georgie. There\u0027s nothing I enjoy more.\" There he was, standing beside our table: my boss Jerome, archdemon of Seattle and its greater metropolitan area. I glared. I didn\u0027t appreciate the mocking tone-or him calling me Georgie. He sat down beside Hugh, and the waiter I\u0027d been trying to summon dashed over immediately. We ordered a new round of drinks. Jerome was clearly in a good mood today, which always made our lives easier. He had on a black designer suit, and his hair was styled exactly the same as John Cusack\u0027s had been in a recent TV interview I watched. That probably bears mentioning: Jerome\u0027s human body of choice was a clone of John Cusack. Succubi can change shape because that\u0027s part of what helps us with seduction. Demons can change shape simply because-like angels-they\u0027re insanely powerful beings who have been around since the beginning of time. They\u0027re \"greater immortals.\" Because of a weird fan obsession that he adamantly denied, Jerome chose to interact in the mortal world looking like the actor. The strange thing was that when we were out like this, humans never seemed to notice the resemblance. \"You haven\u0027t been out with us in a while,\" I pointed out, hoping to change the subject. \"I thought you\u0027ve been busy with demon stuff.\" Rumor had it that Jerome was sparring with another demon, though none of us knew the details. He took one of my cigarettes out of the pack without asking. A moment later, the end of the cigarette lit on its own. Show-off. \"Things have actually taken a pleasant turn,\" he said. He inhaled deeply and then let the smoke swirl around him. \"One less thing to deal with. I\u0027d hoped the incessant babbling about your romantic woes was also going away, but I suppose that\u0027s too much to hope for. Are you still with that charlatan?\" I threw up my hands. \"Why does everyone hate Dante? You guys should be embracing him as a brother.\" Jerome considered, dark eyes thoughtful. \"He annoys me. You can do better.\" \"Jesus Christ,\" I said. \"Maybe she\u0027d see that if she\u0027d stop doing stupid shit like sleeping with her therapist,\" noted Hugh, in what was apparently supposed to be a helpful tone. I turned on him, eyes wide. \"Did you listen to anything I just said?\" \"Plenty,\" he said. Meanwhile, Jerome\u0027s lazy, pleased expression disappeared. He fixed his gaze on me, eyes burning like flame yet inexplicably making me feel cold all over. He smashed the cigarette out and shot up from his seat. Grabbing my arm, he jerked me up from my own spot and started dragging me from the table. \"Come with me,\" he hissed. I stumbled with him out to the hall that led to the restrooms. Once out of the sight of others, he pushed me against a wall and leaned toward me, face filled with fury. It was a sign of his agitation that he was behaving like a human. He could have simply transported both of us to some isolated place. \"You fucked your therapist?\" he exclaimed. I gulped. \"I wasn\u0027t making much progress.\" \"Georgie!\" \"Why is this a problem? He was a good soul. I thought that was what you wanted me to do!\" \"I wanted you to get this fucking chip off your shoulder that you\u0027ve had ever since that boring mortal dumped you.\" I flinched. It was kind of a weird thing. I\u0027d been so depressed after the Seth breakup that Jerome had finally flipped out and told me to go seek help because he was tired of listening to me \"bitch and moan.\" The strangeness of a demon encouraging counseling for one of his employees wasn\u0027t lost on me. But honestly, how could he understand? How could he understand what it was like to have your heart smashed? To be ripped from the person you loved most in the world? My whole existence had lost meaning, and eternity had seemed impossible to bear. For weeks, I wouldn\u0027t go out or talk much to anybody. I\u0027d isolated myself, lost in my own grief. That was when Jerome had thrown up his hands and demanded I snap out of it. And I had, kind of. I\u0027d swung the other way. I\u0027d suddenly become angry-so, so angry at the way life had treated me. Some of my misfortunes were my own fault. But Seth? I didn\u0027t know. I didn\u0027t know what had happened there, and I felt wronged by the world and the lifetimes of hurt it kept giving me. So, I\u0027d started getting back at it. I\u0027d stopped caring. I\u0027d thrown myself into full succubus mode: seeking out the most moral men I could, stealing their life, and breaking their hearts with little remorse. It helped with the pain. Sometimes. \"I\u0027m doing what I\u0027m supposed to!\" I yelled. \"I\u0027m scoring soul after soul. You have nothing to complain about.\" \"You have a bitchy attitude and keep picking fights with everyone-and you aren\u0027t getting better. I\u0027m tired of it. And I\u0027m tired of you.\" I froze, my antagonism turning to pure fear. When a demon said he was tired of you, it often resulted in being recalled to Hell. Or being smote. \"Jerome...\" I tried to assess my best strategy here. Charm? Contrition? He stepped away and took a deep, calming breath. It didn\u0027t help much. His anger came through loud and clear. \"I\u0027m sending you away. I\u0027m going to outsource you to someone.\" \" What ?\" My anger returned, pushing my fear away momentarily. Outsourcing was a huge insult to a succubus. \"You can\u0027t do that.\" \"I can do whatever I fucking want. You answer to me.\" A lanky guy turned down the hall, heading toward the restroom. Jerome fixed him with a piercing, terrifying look. The guy yelped and hastily headed back the other way. \"There\u0027s an archdemon in Vancouver who wants someone to keep an eye on a cult he has an interest in up there.\" \"Up there...\" My mouth dropped open. \"You mean Vancouver, BC? You\u0027re sending me to Canada ?\" Fuck. I really had gone too far. There was also a Vancouver in Washington. That wouldn\u0027t have been so bad. At least I would have stayed domestic. \"He\u0027d wanted a succubus since he only has one and couldn\u0027t spare her. They\u0027ve got their work cut out for them up there, you know. I almost considered sending them Tawny.\" He made a face at the mention of his recently acquired and very, very inept succubus. \"But, well, she\u0027s not...optimal. I hadn\u0027t wanted to give up you either, but now I think it\u0027ll be worth missing my useful succubus for a while to get you out of my hair. I need some peace and quiet.\" \"Look, Jerome,\" I said, hoping I sounded penitent. \"What do you want me to do? Get another therapist? I can do that. I\u0027ll get a woman. An ugly one. And I\u0027ll try to lay off the attitude and-\" \"That\u0027s my decision, Georgie. You need something to occupy you, and this\u0027ll make Cedric happy. He figures a succubus is the best choice to infiltrate his little devil-worshipping cult.\" \"Devil wor-what, you mean like, Satanists?\" \"Something like that.\" I stared. \"Canadian Satanists? You\u0027re sending me to a group of Canadian Satanists?\" His only answer was a shrug. \"If this were happening to anyone else, it would be hilarious,\" I said. \"But why are you doing it? Since when do you help anyone-let alone another demon?\" Demons tended to be insanely competitive with each other. Again, Jerome didn\u0027t answer. He took out a cigarette-honestly, if he had his own, why\u0027d he steal mine earlier?-and did the lighting trick again. He seemed a little less tense after taking a deep drag on it. \"Something else is going on,\" I said warily. \"You\u0027re using me to use him. What\u0027s this really about?\" \"Altruism,\" he said, rolling his eyes. \"Jerome...\" \"Georgina,\" he returned, eyes hard. \"You have no right to question this, not as much as you\u0027ve pissed me off lately. Now go pack your things and brush up on the metric system.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-heat-georgina-kincaid-4/page-1.html","bookId":2057,"book":{"id":2057,"title":"Succubus Heat (Georgina Kincaid #4)","description":"Storyline: Georgina Kincaid Book 4: Succubus Heat Which should be a good thing.
