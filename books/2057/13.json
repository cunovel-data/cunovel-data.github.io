{"id":110307,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"Hearing Cedric assure me I couldn\u0027t die lifted a huge weight off my shoulders. I left the Cellar with much less anxiety, though I still had no intention of doing anything that might test how exactly we\u0027d heal from decapitation. So, while I still operated with caution, I no longer felt suffocated or threatened by every aspect of the world.\n Rather than go home, I drove down to Dante\u0027s shop. His store/apartment was in Rainier Valley, on the southeast side of Seattle. He had no regularly posted hours for his assorted \"psychic\" services, but he would usually hang around there at night if he had nothing else to do. It tended to be the time drunk people or couples out on dates (or high teens) would wander in looking for fun and novelty. Daytime business hours didn\u0027t generally bring out that many who were seeking help from the divine unless, perhaps, it was someone seeking advice on stock trading.\n Dante had no customers tonight, however. The shop and its flickering neon sign seemed sad and lonely. I pushed through the unlocked door and found him leaning against the checkout counter, leafing through a copy of Maxim .\n \"What gives?\" I asked. \"Your subscription to Frauds and Scams Weekly run out?\"\n He glanced up at me with a smile, flipping black hair out of his face. \"Just needed something pretty to look at since I didn\u0027t know when I\u0027d be seeing you again.\"\n I planted a kiss on his cheek. \"Holy shit. That\u0027s the sweetest thing you\u0027ve ever said to me.\"\n \"Yeah, well, I can make some filthy sexual suggestions to you if you\u0027d prefer.\"\n \"What, and ruin foreplay for next time?\"\n This made his grin grow, and he shut the magazine. \"To what do I owe the pleasure? Shouldn\u0027t you be visiting our neighbors to the north? Or is that done? I honestly can\u0027t keep track.\"\n \"Well. About that.\" God, how I was going to explain what had happened? Had all of this seriously happened in just one day? It felt like a year had gone by since I got woozy in the car. \"Something strange happened today.\"\n \"Strange like you sold out of Jane Austen books at the store or strange like the rules of time and space as we know them are about to be ripped apart?\"\n \"Mmm...more like that last one.\"\n \"Shit.\"\n I took a deep breath, figuring I should just get the big stuff out of the way. \"There\u0027s no easy way to put this, but...I\u0027m not a succubus anymore.\"\n \"I never believed you were a succubus.\"\n I groaned. That had been an old joke between us when we\u0027d first met. Oh, the irony. \"I\u0027m serious,\" I said. \"No more succubus. And Jerome\u0027s disappeared too, possibly opening up Seattle to a new demonic reign.\"\n Dante stared at me, eyes speculative as he assessed me for the truth. He was speechless for the first time I\u0027d known him. Not waiting for more witty commentary, I plunged forward. I explained about the summoning, what it had done to all of us lesser immortals, how demons everywhere were now sizing up Seattle, and why I needed to find Jerome as soon as possible.\n When I finally finished, it took Dante several moments to gather his thoughts. \"So...you\u0027ve seriously lost your succubus powers?\"\n \"Abilities,\" I corrected. \"And yes, I have. Are you saying that after all that other stuff I just told you about the balance of power in Seattle, my succubus status is what caught your attention the most?\"\n He shrugged. \"You gotta admit it\u0027s weird. Besides, that other stuff doesn\u0027t affect me. You do.\" His eyes narrowed. \"Am I going to have to use a condom now?\"\n \"What? No. Of course not.\"\n \"You sure?\"\n \"You\u0027ve never batted an eye over me stealing pieces of your soul these last few months, but the nonexistent threat of child support suddenly scares you?\"\n \"Well, yeah, seeing as my bank account\u0027s got more in it than my soul.\"\n I glanced around the shabby room. \"Debatable.\"\n \"Cute,\" he conceded. \"But I\u0027d be asking a few more questions about all of this if I were you. Like, can you die?\"\n \"I already asked that one,\" I said smugly. \"And the answer is no. Our immortal bodies are still essentially the same. We\u0027re just cut off from all the perks.\" I hoped he didn\u0027t ask about decapitation because I honestly wasn\u0027t in the mood to debate that.\n \"Okay, so what do you want from me?\" he asked.\n \"What makes you think I want anything?\"\n He looked at me.\n \"Okay, maybe I do want something. But come on, who else would know more about this stuff than you?\"\n \"Who knows more about demons? Hmm, let me think. I know. How about the demons you work for , the ones who are all-powerful and have been around since the beginning of time?\"\n \"They\u0027re not all-powerful. Otherwise they wouldn\u0027t need a human for the summoning-or end up getting summoned in the first place. And that\u0027s what I need you for. There can\u0027t be that many humans in the area capable of doing this, are there? You have to know who they are.\"\n Dante opened his mouth, no doubt with a snappy reply ready, and then abruptly closed it. \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said slowly. \"I don\u0027t keep track of those things.\"\n I leaned toward him, incredulous. \"Of course you do! Do you not want to tell me? Why?\"\n He sighed, his hesitant expression turning typically annoyed. \"Because those kinds of people get pissed off if you start advertising their names.\"\n \"What, you\u0027re afraid they\u0027re going to come beat you up?\"\n \"No. Not exactly. But there\u0027s sort of...a professional courtesy in these circles.\"\n \"I\u0027ll be discreet. I won\u0027t tell them where I got the information.\"\n \"Most of them already know we\u0027re together. They\u0027d figure it out. They keep an eye on those kinds of things.\" He turned considering. \"Of course, in that same vein, a lot of them know you as a succubus and might just think you knew through your own connections.\"\n He still seemed hesitant, so I played a mean card. \"Well, I can always go ask Erik if you\u0027re too nervous about it.\"\n Erik was another mortal in town who dealt with the occult and paranormal. Unlike Dante, who was a practitioner, Erik simply studied and built up knowledge of the magical undercurrents in the city. He had a psychic\u0027s gifts and was attuned to what most human eyes didn\u0027t see. Sometimes he could even see what immortals couldn\u0027t. He and Dante had an old, old grudge and didn\u0027t enjoy being around each other, to put it mildly.\n My attempt to bait Dante didn\u0027t work, though. \"Don\u0027t even try it, succubus. Making me jealous of the old man won\u0027t make me help you.\"\n I looked up at him pleadingly. \"What will make you help me?\"\n He traced the outline of my lips with his fingertip, gray eyes wicked and thoughtful. \"Not sure it\u0027s anything you can do while cut off from your super-secret powers. You\u0027re not a sex goddess anymore.\"\n \"Hey, I don\u0027t need super-secret powers to be a sex goddess.\"\n Just then, three twentysomethings stumbled in, staring wide-eyed at the shop as they tried to stifle nervous giggles. They undoubtedly had the same kind of potential that high teens did. I gave Dante one last frantic plea. \"Please? Just give me the names. You don\u0027t have to do anything else. And I won\u0027t say anything. I swear it.\"\n Dante scowled, glanced at me, at the potential customers, and then back at me. He told them he\u0027d be with them in a minute and then hastily jotted four names down on a scrap of paper. Two of them I recognized.\n \"Thank you,\" I said. I beamed, and to my surprise, something in his cynical expression softened a little.\n \"God, that smile,\" he muttered. \"You might just be right.\"\n \"About what?\"\n \"You really don\u0027t need any powers to be a sex goddess. Your hair\u0027s a little messy, though.\" He walked around the counter and gave me a quick half-hug. \"Be safe, succubus. Don\u0027t test the limits of that not-dying thing.\"\n \"And buy some condoms?\" I teased.\n He shrugged. \"You\u0027re the one who was having prophetic dreams about having kids a little while ago.\" Turning away from me, he put on his jovial con-man persona and beckoned the group over with pitches about palms and Tarot.\n He\u0027d spoken the words in a light, off-hand kind of way, but as I slowly walked back to my car, they slapped me in the face.\n Prophetic dreams...\n Nyx\u0027s dreams.\n The things she\u0027d shown me during that time had been so vivid that they seemed almost more real than my own life. The thing is, by almost all accounts, Nyx had a grasp on the future and could show people things that would happen to them. That was how she spread chaos in the world, by showing people these visions and making them think they knew how their futures would unfold. Unfortunately, while the visions came true, they never came true the way their victims thought they would. She\u0027d led a lot of people to their deaths that way.\n Nonetheless, it seemed fairly clear that the dreams she\u0027d sent to me had been distractions, not destructive images of what would come. In my visions, she\u0027d shown me-over and over-with a daughter, waiting for a man I loved to come home. The dreams had consumed me, almost making me want to sleep and have my energy taken each night. As I\u0027d noted while holding Kayla, there was no way any piece of the vision could ever happen to me. I couldn\u0027t have any sort of relationship like that. And I certainly couldn\u0027t have a daughter, not of my own blood. Immortals didn\u0027t reproduce. When I\u0027d sold my soul for immortality and shape-shifting, I\u0027d given up certain aspects of my humanity. There could be no child for me. Not ever.\n And yet...\n I came to a stop on the sidewalk, still about a block away from my car. What if Dante had inadvertently stumbled onto something? What if being in this stasis had altered that piece of me that had lost the ability to conceive? Cedric had said I was still technically immortal, but he\u0027d also said my body would respond and heal like a human\u0027s. What all did that entail? Would unprotected sex lead to conception? Is that what Nyx\u0027s visions had been pointing to? She\u0027d sworn she\u0027d shown me the truth. Had she?\n I was breathing fast again, though at least this time, I knew I didn\u0027t have to worry about giving myself a heart attack. Okay. I needed to calm down. This pregnancy possibility was as distracting as the hooking-up-with-Seth possibility. I\u0027d never get anything accomplished if I lost myself in fantasies.\n With a sigh, I glanced down at Dante\u0027s piece of paper, now crumpled in my hand. I\u0027d clenched it into a ball without even realizing it as I walked. I\u0027d been too preoccupied to even notice...\n Babies and Seth. The things I wanted most.\n I forced myself to keep moving toward my car. But as I unlocked the door, I had to wonder ruefully if maybe I shouldn\u0027t be so quick to get Jerome back after all.\n I started following up on Dante\u0027s leads the next morning. Leaving my place was a little harder than I\u0027d expected, though. Despite the fact I got ready plenty of mornings without shape-shifting, my closet seemed terribly small. And while my hair seemed fine when I finished it, I had a feeling it\u0027d be frizzy the next time I checked the mirror. The only bright part was when I found Dante\u0027s watch under the bed. I thought I\u0027d lost it yesterday, so at least my accessories collection was still respectable. Nonetheless, I had a feeling I was soon going to discover just how much I\u0027d come to rely on my abilities.\n Locating addresses from Dante\u0027s list of names required a little sleuthing here and there, but for the most part, I didn\u0027t have much difficulty finding them. Unfortunately, once found, these magicians weren\u0027t exactly helpful.\n One of the ones I visited knew me. She was familiar with Hell\u0027s local servants, and while she gave me a small degree of respect, she was as hesitant to answer questions as Dante had insinuated. Two of the other names were people who didn\u0027t know me, and that immediately created a problem. With my succubus powers shut off, I had no immortal signature, and both of these people were the types who could sense that. Me coming in and claiming to be a succubus was met with scorn and disbelief. I managed to glean some information from them but nothing of any use.\n Equally difficult was that not only could they not sense me, I couldn\u0027t sense them. Admittedly, a succubus didn\u0027t have the same ability to gauge human power the way a full-fledged demon could, but I could occasionally sense magic around a person or object. Today, I was completely blind. I had to rely on my strength to read people, but these dark magicians were as good at cons as Dante. They were well-versed in the art of concealing the truth.\n It was almost noon by the time I visited the last name, a guy named Greg. I felt pretty discouraged by this point and even cracked and had a cigarette along the way. Greg had no storefront like Dante and mostly worked his spells out of his house, a small bungalow in Wallingford. When he answered the door, his disheveled state told me I\u0027d woken him up. On the bright side, he recognized me, which meant I wouldn\u0027t have to convince him I was a succubus.\n \"What do you want?\" he asked suspiciously. He was built big and could have had an impressive physique if he\u0027d ever gone to the gym. It was obvious he hadn\u0027t.\n \"I wanted to talk to you about demon summoning.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know anything about it.\"\n He started to shut the door. I stuck my foot out to block it. \"Wait. Do you know anyone who would?\"\n \"No. And even if I did, what makes you think I\u0027d tell you?\" He tried to close the door again, then paused. He narrowed his already too-small eyes at me. \"There\u0027s something weird about you. No aura.\"\n I didn\u0027t answer right away. \"Maybe you\u0027re losing your touch.\"\n This actually brought a small smile. \"Not likely. What happened? Who got summoned?\"\n \"No one. And even if they did, what makes you think I\u0027d tell you?\" I mimicked.\n He laughed, a guttural sound that came from low in his throat. When the laughter faded, he studied me for several long seconds, face cunning and speculative. \"Okay. I\u0027ll talk to you.\" He pushed the door open. \"Come on in.\"\n I gingerly stepped into his living room. The place was a disaster. Dirty dishes were piled on the coffee table, the remains of food hardened and crusty. Dust coated every piece of furniture, and the wood floor looked like it hadn\u0027t been swept since the last century. Uneasily, I wondered if my new humanlike body was susceptible to germs.\n Several books were piled on the couch, their covers meant to look sinister in shades of black and red with drawings of pentagrams. It put me in mind of Evan\u0027s faux Satanic accoutrements, though as hard as it was to believe, Evan had a thousand times more class than this guy.\n Greg offered me neither a chair nor refreshments, which was fine by me. He stood in front of me, arms crossed. \"Well? What do you want to know?\"\n \"I want to know if you\u0027ve done any demon summoning lately.\"\n \"Not that any demons have been summoned, of course.\"\n \"This is speculative,\" I replied with a simpering smile. I studied as much of his home as I could while I spoke. Beyond him, I could see an equally messy kitchen with a gas stove and magnet-covered refrigerator.\n \"You think if I\u0027d summoned a demon, I\u0027d be living like this? Fuck, I\u0027d have plasma-screen TVs and concubines.\"\n I recalled the discussion with my friends, noting that any human who\u0027d summoned Jerome would simply keep the demon hidden and not use it for personal gain and errands. Still, if Greg had summoned Jerome on behalf of another demon, there would have been some reward involved. Maybe it wouldn\u0027t entail TVs or concubines, but it seemed like there\u0027d be some sign of a windfall here. Maybe he\u0027d gotten a Swiss bank account.\n \"Okay. You know anyone who recently acquired concubines?\"\n \"Nope. But I can give you some names of people who\u0027d be more likely.\" He listed two of the magicians I\u0027d already visited.\n \"I\u0027ve talked to them.\"\n \"Sorry. Not my problem.\" My eyes returned to the books on the couch. I stepped toward them. \"May I?\"\n \"Knock yourself out.\"\n I picked up one of the books, skimming through it in hopes of finding information about summoning. Nope. It was fluffy \"evil\" stuff, exactly like the Army of Darkness\u0027 propaganda. The second book proved the same. The third, however, was a legitimate spell book, filled with the kind of dark rites Dante practiced. Hopeful, I flipped through the pages one by one. It had some vile contents, but there was nothing about summoning. Greg\u0027s willingness to let me browse the books should have been a tip-off that they contained nothing of use.\n \"All done?\"\n I jerked around. Greg\u0027s voice was close to me-too close. I\u0027d had my back to him while checking out the books, but now he was right behind me. I took a few steps back and bumped the couch.\n \"Yeah,\" I said nervously. \"Thanks for the help. I should leave now.\"\n \"Not yet,\" he said, moving closer. \"You just got here.\"\n I tried to wriggle off to the side, but his hands suddenly reached out and grabbed a hold of my arms, pinning me into place.\n \"What are you doing?\" I demanded. There went my heart rate again.\n \"I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on with all this summoning stuff, but I do know there\u0027s a succubus here who doesn\u0027t feel like a succubus anymore, which probably means you can\u0027t fight like one.\"\n I tried to break from his grasp, but his hands were like steel. \"You\u0027re crazy. Of course I\u0027m a succubus. You know I am.\"\n \"Yeah? Then shape-shift away from me. Turn into a bird. Turn into a bodybuilder.\"\n I clenched my teeth and tried to shake his hold again. \"Let me go, you son of a bitch. You hurt me, and a whole host of demons are going to show up and rip you limb from limb.\"\n \"Not so sure about that,\" he chuckled. \"This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance. You think any succubus would fuck someone like me?\"\n He shoved me down onto the couch, one strong arm pinning me in place while the other hand fumbled awkwardly under my shirt and grabbed a hold of my breast. Moving his head close, he tried to press his lips against mine, but I turned my head just in time.\n \"Let me go!\" I screamed. I managed to wriggle a leg free and knee him in the gut. It wasn\u0027t enough to free me, but it made him scowl.\n I\u0027d worried about getting hit by cars, meteors, and structurally unsound overpasses. Never, never had I thought about being raped. It hadn\u0027t been a fear of mine for centuries, not since I realized I could shape-shift into someone larger and stronger, someone capable of throwing off any assailant.\n Maybe it shouldn\u0027t have bothered me so much. I\u0027d had sex with plenty of people I didn\u0027t like over the years. I\u0027d always grimaced and waited it out. But there was something about this that was different. It wasn\u0027t my choice, and compounding it all was the feeling of helplessness I had. I hated not having options. I hated not being able to think my way out of something. There was nothing to be done, though. Not this time.\n The most I could do was keep struggling and flailing. I did have some self-defense training, after all. I\u0027d learned to use weapons and punch over the years. I\u0027d nailed Niphon pretty good at Christmas. Unfortunately, what I could do now was limited with Greg on me like this. He simply outweighed me. Still, my efforts must have proven annoying because Greg growled and grabbed both my arms in an attempt to flip me over. I yelled profanities at him and got another knee-jab in, close to his groin but not close enough.\n And that\u0027s when it happened.\n The smell hit me first. An overwhelming and suffocating odor of natural gas. I stopped struggling for half a second. I didn\u0027t need to be human to know that meant trouble.\n Before I could process that further, the kitchen exploded into flames.\n Fire expanded out into the living room. It didn\u0027t quite reach us, but I think Greg must have still gotten burned because he screamed in pain and released his hold on me. His body had shielded the worst from me, and mostly all I felt was a rolling wave of heat and air.\n I didn\u0027t bother to think or question anything. Greg had released me in his confusion, and I bolted. I scrambled from the couch and ran out the front door, away from the fire. Away from Greg.\n I drove off as fast as I could, my Passat\u0027s tires squealing on the pavement. Sweat poured off me, and my hands could barely grip the steering wheel through their shaking. About a mile away, I heard the singing of sirens, but I couldn\u0027t spare a thought for what had happened. I couldn\u0027t think about whether Greg had made it out or not. I couldn\u0027t think about how a gas leak had miraculously saved me.\n The only thing I could think about now was getting away and getting to safety. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-heat-georgina-kincaid-4/page-13.html","bookId":2057,"book":{"id":2057,"title":"Succubus Heat (Georgina Kincaid #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Georgina Kincaid Book 4: Succubus Heat \n Which should be a good thing.
