{"id":110311,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"The sweet scent of a white chocolate mocha woke me from a heavy sleep the following morning. For a few moments, as I stirred to consciousness, it was like waking up any other day. Then, as I opened my eyes and shifted position, my body\u0027s nerves came to life, reminding me what had happened yesterday. It wasn\u0027t the horrible torturous pain I\u0027d experienced before, but I had enough aches and soreness to dissuade me from too much movement. Still, I managed to more or less sit up when Dante entered my bedroom.\n He held the mocha in one hand and what looked like a bakery bag tucked under his arm. In the other hand, he carried an enormous vase of blue and white hydrangeas, interspersed with orchids. I never would have pictured those particular flowers going together, but the arrangement worked.\n \"Did you rob a florist?\" I asked.\n Dante gave me a withering look as he handed me the mocha. \"Why are you assuming the worst again?\"\n \"Because orchids aren\u0027t cheap,\" I said.\n \"They were out of crab grass, so I had to settle.\" He gently placed the vase on my dresser and then freed the bakery bag. \"And I beat up some kids for these.\"\n After a long, delicious sip, I set the mocha on my bedside table and took the bag from him. Inside were chocolate croissants-my favorite kind of breakfast pastry.\n \"All this because I got beat up?\" I asked.\n He sat on the side of the bed. \"I\u0027m worried about you.\"\n \"I should get in fights with demons more often,\" I teased, my last few words getting muffled as I bit into a croissant. Tiny flakes and crumbs fell onto my sheets, but I didn\u0027t care.\n \"Not funny, succubus,\" he said. And to my surprise, I could see that he meant it. None of his usual sardonic humor showed on his face. There was no bitter twist to his lips. \"That\u0027s never happening again. And I\u0027m going to make sure you get better, immortal healing or not.\"\n \"Never took you for a nursemaid.\"\n \"Be quiet,\" he snapped. \"And keep eating. Your body needs calories to heal.\"\n Happy to oblige, I started to take another bite and then froze. \"Do you think I might start putting on weight?\" Calories were nothing I\u0027d ever had to count before. I\u0027d feared neither weight gain nor health effects from the things I ate.\n \"I think that\u0027s the least of your worries.\"\n I supposed he was right. I kept eating-but with a little less enthusiasm. He still looked so serious and worried that I couldn\u0027t shake my warm and fuzzy feelings. \"Thank you for all of this. It\u0027s really great.\"\n He smiled at me, and his gray eyes were lovely in the morning light. \"Not many people in this world I feel deserve my help. You\u0027re in an exclusive club.\"\n I started to make a comment about how the rest of the club members must be imaginary, but there had already been too much snark this morning. Nanette\u0027s attack had seriously shaken Dante up.\n \"Thank you,\" I said again. A thought struck me. \"I might have some other way for you to help. Will you grab my purse?\"\n He retrieved it from the living room and handed it over. Reaching inside, I was relieved to see the photo that I\u0027d swiped from Mary was still there. I studied it for a moment, willing the medallion to yield some sort of revelation. All I saw was a translucent brown disc and runes or symbols that could easily be mistaken for a child\u0027s scribbles. With a sigh, I handed it to him.\n \"Does this mean anything to you?\"\n His brows knit thoughtfully as he looked it over. \"No. Should it?\"\n \"I think it might be part of Jerome\u0027s summoning. Remember when I asked you about an artist who carved quartz? This is what I turned up. Supposedly, the stone and marks are clues, but I don\u0027t know what they are. I guess that\u0027s where I need people like you or Erik.\"\n He gazed at the picture for several more moments, and to my surprise, I saw anger building in his features. Abruptly, he stood up and tossed the picture on the floor.\n \"Son of a bitch,\" he growled.\n \"What\u0027s the matter?\" I exclaimed.\n \"This,\" he said, gesturing at me and the fallen picture. \"This is the matter. What good am I, succubus? I\u0027m ten times more powerful than those people I sent you to go see. Aside from Lancaster, there\u0027s probably no one else in this fucking town who knows as much about the arcane as I do. And what good is it?\" He paced around my room and ran his hand angrily through his hair. \"Nothing. That\u0027s what it\u0027s good for. I can\u0027t seem to help you. I can\u0027t do a goddamned thing. I couldn\u0027t save you from that demoness. And I don\u0027t know anything about this medallion thing.\"\n I was stunned by his reaction. \"Hey, whoa. It\u0027s okay. Sit down. Don\u0027t beat yourself up.\"\n \"It\u0027s not okay.\" He came to a halt. \"I feel...powerless.\" For someone who\u0027d spent his life doing horrible things in the quest for power, I could recognize what a hard admission that was.\n \"You\u0027re not obligated to do anything here,\" I said gently. \"You help me more than you realize. But this isn\u0027t your fight. This isn\u0027t your responsibility.\"\n \" You\u0027re my responsibility,\" he said. \"If I can\u0027t look out for you, then why do you need me?\"\n \"I\u0027m not with you for what you can do for me.\"\n \"Yeah? You\u0027re with me for my winning personality?\"\n The truth was, I still wasn\u0027t sure at times why I was with him. I couldn\u0027t help but recall his comments about me keeping him as a bed warmer, but true or not, now wasn\u0027t the time to bring that up. Plus, he\u0027d been sweet lately-something I\u0027d never expected when I\u0027d turned to him in my post-Seth rage.\n \"Dante, I\u0027m serious. Don\u0027t worry about any of this. I\u0027ll take care of it and talk to my friends.\"\n I saw from the look on his face that that wasn\u0027t quite what he\u0027d wanted to hear. Knowing I had other people to go to seemed to make him feel more inadequate.\n \"You shouldn\u0027t be involved in this at all,\" he said.\n \"What, in finding Jerome? Of course I have to be.\"\n \"There are others, people who are more powerful. I don\u0027t want you getting hurt again! Why can\u0027t you just lie low and keep yourself safe?\" he demanded.\n \"Because it\u0027s not what I do! And no one else is going to do it anyway. They\u0027re just letting this go. Letting Jerome go.\"\n \"Why don\u0027t you let it go?\" he asked. \"Would it be so bad to work under another demon? You\u0027ve worked for others.\"\n I turned and gazed out the window. The sky was blue, but something told me it was cold out. It was a quirk of Seattle weather. We often had warmer temperatures when it was cloudy out, colder ones when it was sunny. Dragging my eyes back to Dante, I said, \"Yeah, I have. But this is different. This isn\u0027t right-it shouldn\u0027t have happened. I have to find Jerome.\"\n \"Yes. You do. It\u0027s written all over you. Why do you have to make everything so difficult and create these problems?\"\n \"If you\u0027re unhappy, no one\u0027s making you stick around,\" I said quietly.\n \"Of course I\u0027m sticking around. And if there\u0027s nothing to be done for your impulsivity, I might as well help.\" He snatched up the photo and glared at it. \"Let me take this and ask some questions. I might not know what it is-yet-but there are resources I can tap.\"\n There was a hard set to his face. He was a man with a mission, which I preferred to him being down on himself or ranting at me. I was about to send him off with my blessings, but something held me back. I couldn\u0027t let the picture go.\n \"I want to keep the photo,\" I told him.\n He stared. \"You don\u0027t think I\u0027ll bring it back?\"\n \"No, I\u0027m not worried about that. But I did a lot to get it, and besides, I want to show it to some people too. We\u0027ll make a copy of it. You can take that.\"\n \"Yeah? You got a copy machine in the bathroom?\"\n \"Can\u0027t you just draw it or something?\"\n \"Succubus.\"\n \"Well, I don\u0027t know! But if you want to do sleuthing, you\u0027re going to have to find a workaround. Until I feel like traipsing around the city with you, I want the picture to stay with me.\"\n He glowered, looking very much like his usual bitter self. Finally, realizing I wasn\u0027t going to yield, he did a hasty trace of the medallion onto another sheet of paper. He added a few notes off to the side and did his best approximation of the symbols. He seemed miserable the entire time.\n \"Sorry,\" I said.\n \"It\u0027s fine,\" he said.\n \"You\u0027re going now?\"\n \"If you think you\u0027ll be okay.\"\n I assured him I would be. My phone was nearby, and I had a feeling if he stayed, he\u0027d just grow more and more upset about how he\u0027d let me down and about how I was putting myself at risk for reasons he didn\u0027t understand. At least this gave him a feeling of purpose. I promised to call if something happened and breathed a sigh of relief when he finally left.\n I stayed in bed for a while after that, consuming my calorie-laden breakfast and thinking about his extreme reaction. I hoped he\u0027d find something out for me, and in the meantime, I needed to do some investigating of my own. First things first, though. I needed to shower.\n It turned out to be harder than I expected-but not impossible. I just had to move slowly when I walked to the bathroom, careful not to get too ambitious. Hugh\u0027s bandages still covered my back, and it took a fair bit of dexterity to remove them. They were soaked with blood, but underneath, the cuts showed signs of Mei\u0027s healing. They were still there, still uncomfortable, but had all scabbed over and were much smaller. I kept the water lukewarm as I showered and was careful when I toweled off to not break any of the scabs open.\n By the time I was sitting on my couch in the living room, I felt like I\u0027d run a marathon. I\u0027d never wanted shape-shifting so badly in my life. I wore loose clothes-drawstring pants and a T-shirt without a bra-but it had taken some effort to put them on. My hair I\u0027d given up on completely, figuring combing it out would have to do. I didn\u0027t have the patience to dry it and didn\u0027t want to think about the frizziness I was inviting.\n Aubrey joined me on the couch as I rested from my morning labors and flipped through the channels. After cycling through twice, I gave up and left the TV on some sort of nature show about Siberian tigers. Aubrey watched it with wide eyes, but I wasn\u0027t interested.\n \"This is your equivalent of reality television,\" I observed.\n \"The talk shows don\u0027t come on until later,\" a voice suddenly said. \"That\u0027s when things get good.\"\n I sighed. \"Carter. What a pleasant surprise.\"\n The angel strolled into my line of sight and sat down on the armchair opposite me. Aubrey immediately left me and hopped onto his lap.\n \"Traitor,\" I said.\n He grinned and scratched her head. \"Word on the street is that you had a bad day yesterday.\"\n \"I\u0027ve had worse,\" I said. \"Marginally. You should have seen me before Mei healed me.\"\n \"Bah, demons can\u0027t heal. Not really. They lose the finesse it takes when they cross over.\"\n \"Hey, I\u0027ll take what help I can get.\" I brightened. \"And speaking of help, I think I\u0027ve got a picture of the seal-\"\n \"No.\"\n \"No what?\"\n \"I know what you\u0027re going to ask, and the answer is no.\"\n \"You have no idea what I\u0027m going to ask!\"\n \"You\u0027re going to ask me to help identify the seal so you can figure out where Jerome is.\"\n I stayed silent. Damn.\n He rolled his eyes. \"And the answer is no.\"\n \"But you could make this so much easier,\" I argued. \"Dante\u0027s out trying to figure out what the seal means. You could tell me right now.\"\n \"Georgina, I told you before. I can\u0027t interfere.\"\n \"Then why are you here?\"\n \"To see how you\u0027re feeling. Believe me, I wish I could interfere. I\u0027d do a better healing job than Mei.\"\n I fell silent, mind spinning. \"Were you here yesterday?\"\n \"Doing what?\"\n \"Look, I won\u0027t consider it interfering, but just tell me if it was you.\"\n Carter didn\u0027t look confused very often. If anything, he was usually the one messing with other people\u0027s minds. I think under normal circumstances, when the immortal state of affairs in Seattle wasn\u0027t in limbo, he would have faked it and hidden his confusion. Now, he just shook his head in exasperation.\n \"What are you talking about?\"\n \"Someone was here after Nanette beat me up. A guy. He put me to bed and called Hugh.\"\n \"It wasn\u0027t me.\"\n \"Technically, it wouldn\u0027t even be interfering.\"\n \"Georgina,\" he said sternly. \"Listen. It wasn\u0027t me.\"\n I held his gaze and shivered at the intensity in his eyes. His were gray, but whereas Dante\u0027s were like leaden clouds on a winter day, Carter\u0027s were like gleaming silver.\n \"It wasn\u0027t you,\" I said at last. He\u0027d answered directly, with none of the half-truths and subterfuge angels normally employed. He\u0027d answered directly, and angels couldn\u0027t lie. \"I suppose you didn\u0027t blow up the stove either?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Who did, then? You said in Vancouver you\u0027d try to protect me. I figured this was you.\"\n \"It\u0027s possible the stove blew up because of a gas leak.\"\n \"Maybe,\" I grumbled.\n He smiled, instantly transforming him to the mocking angel I usually knew. \"Believe me, Daughter of Lilith, I wish I could take credit for these things. And if it comes down to it, and I have the means and ability, I will try to protect you. For now, I\u0027ve still got to stay out of this.\"\n \"House calls aside.\"\n \"Just a visit between friends.\" He winked and stood up. \"I really do wish I could help more, but you\u0027re going to have to find another way. Be careful, whatever you end up doing.\"\n \"You\u0027re not warning me away from all this?\"\n He arched an eyebrow. \"Should I be?\"\n \"No,\" I mused. \"But everyone else is. They say it\u0027s dangerous.\"\n \"It is dangerous. But these are dangerous times, and honestly? You\u0027re the only one that I think has the means or desire to get us out of this mess. Good luck, Georgina. And don\u0027t leave the house without checking your hair.\" He vanished.\n \"Fucking angels.\"\n I realized then that I was starving for real food, not sugar-filled sweets. My kitchen was sparse as usual, so I decided to risk the world and go pick up something. I was tired and certainly incapable of running a marathon, but Mei\u0027s healing really had gone a long way. I could manage the one block walk to a nearby take-out Chinese restaurant. I placed the order, and by the time I was out of my robe and out the door, the food was ready. I stopped at a convenience store as well to pick up some pop, and the whole endeavor only ended up taking about thirty minutes. From the look on Aubrey\u0027s face, you would have thought I\u0027d been gone a whole day, but then, she just wanted my orange chicken.\n I changed back to my robe and relaxed with the food, pondering how to spend my day. As I\u0027d told Dante, I didn\u0027t want to go traipsing about town, but I wanted some leads on the medallion. Erik was probably my best bet at this point, and I hoped he\u0027d be able to ID my symbols from phone descriptions. Before I could do that, I heard a knock at my door. I expected it to be Hugh making a house call, but to my astonishment, it was Seth.\n \"Hey,\" I said, stepping aside so that he could come in.\n \"Hey,\" he returned.\n I stuffed my hands into the ratty robe\u0027s pockets, wishing I hadn\u0027t been so hasty to change back to casual mode. My hair was undoubtedly a lost cause, so there was no point stressing over that. \"How\u0027s it going?\"\n \"Okay.\" He met my eyes frankly, something he hadn\u0027t done in a while. It sent a tingle down my back. \"I was just nearby and wanted to...well, that is...\" He sighed. \"I just wanted to apologize for what happened yesterday....\"\n Yesterday. The kiss. Something that only a demon attack could have dwarfed.\n I shook my head, trying not to recall how I\u0027d felt that kiss all the way to my toes. \"You have nothing to apologize for. I think...I think I was as much to blame. Besides, it was nothing.\"\n \"Nothing?\" he asked, looking both surprised and hurt.\n \"I mean, not nothing ,\" I amended hastily. \"But we were both kind of worked up, and things got crazy, and well, like I said...nothing to apologize for.\"\n \"Okay...I\u0027m glad you\u0027re not upset. I don\u0027t want there to be anything...well, anything bad between us.\"\n I thought about all the fights and arguments. \"Well, I\u0027m not sure we\u0027ve reached that state. I mean, come on, do you think things will ever be normal and friendly between us?\"\n \"Yes,\" he said bluntly. \"No matter what has or hasn\u0027t happened romantically, I still feel like...like there\u0027s something between us...like, a connection, I mean. I feel like we\u0027re always destined to be important in each other\u0027s lives.\"\n You are my life , I thought and promptly looked away, as though he might have heard me. \"Do you regret it?\" I asked before I realized I had.\n \"Regret?\"\n \"Ending things.\"\n I looked back at him, fearing his answer, no matter what it was. \"I regret...well, I don\u0027t regret saving you from future hurt. I do regret the hurt I\u0027ve caused you...if I\u0027d known you\u0027d react and spiral the way you have...\"\n \"You can\u0027t take that into consideration,\" I said hastily. \"That\u0027s not your fault.\" I was surprised to be saying that, but it was true. My bad behavior these last months had been my doing.\n \"I can\u0027t help it. I\u0027ll always worry about you. Like I said, I feel like no matter what, we\u0027re always going to be connected...like there\u0027s something bigger than us at work. As it is...\"\n \"What?\"\n \"Never mind.\"\n I stepped forward, never taking my eyes off him. \"Tell me.\"\n \"As it is...\" He shrugged. \"Life is easier not dating you. But sometimes...it feels incomplete. Like there\u0027s a piece of me missing.\"\n \"And that\u0027s easier?\"\n \"Think of it as winning the lottery and having people waiting on all your needs, but it\u0027s at the cost of, I don\u0027t know, getting your leg amputated.\"\n \"Wow. You should be a writer with that imagery.\"\n He smiled. \"Yeah, yeah. But you know what I mean.\"\n Except, I was missing a part of my life and things were harder, not easier. \"You at least have Maddie.\"\n \"You have Dante.\"\n \"Dante\u0027s not Maddie, believe me.\"\n \"Fair enough. She\u0027s great...I care about her...love her...I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s all just different.\"\n Silence fell, but it was comfortable. \"Good lord. I can\u0027t believe we\u0027re discussing this rationally.\"\n \"See? Not so hard to be friends.\"\n I had my doubts about that. \"I guess.\"\n \"Don\u0027t worry. We\u0027ll keep trying. Before long, we\u0027ll be on a bowling league or something.\" He spoke his words lightly, but there was a catch that belied the truth of his words. Being friends wasn\u0027t easy for Seth either. He still cared about me and was suffering just as much as me with this separation. Seeing that made something in me soften.\n \"Hey, it\u0027s okay. We\u0027ll make this work.\"\n I reached out to hug him, and he automatically returned it. I felt warm and safe and right in his embrace-until he casually squeezed my back. I cried out, jerking away at the pain that shot through me. We sprang apart, and he looked at me in alarm. \"What\u0027s wrong? Are you okay?\"\n \"It\u0027s...complicated.\" My standard answer to uncomfortable questions.\n \"Georgina!\"\n \"It\u0027s nothing. Don\u0027t worry about it.\"\n He strode toward me, reached a hand out, then pulled back. Intensity filled his face. \"Are you hurt?\"\n I tried to keep out of his reach. \"Look, I got in a fight last night, and I\u0027m sporting some, uh, residual effects. It\u0027s mostly gone, though, so there\u0027s nothing to worry about.\"\n \"You? Got in a fight? With who?\"\n \"Whom. And it was with Nanette. I told you, it\u0027s nothing.\"\n \"Who\u0027s Nanette?\"\n \"She\u0027s...a demon.\"\n He gave me a level look. \"A demon. A full-fledged demon.\"\n \"Something like that.\"\n \"Let me see your back.\"\n \"Seth-\"\n \"Georgina! Let me see your back.\"\n There was anger in his words, not at me, but at the thought of someone hurting me. It reminded me a little of Dante\u0027s reaction, except that Dante always had a bit of anger in him. It was normal. To see it woken up in Seth...to see him so passionate and fierce...\n Slowly, slowly, I turned around and undid the front of my robe, letting it slip halfway down my back. I heard Seth gasp at what he saw, and then a few moments later, he stepped forward and pushed my hair off my back so that he could get a better view. I shivered when his fingers touched my skin.\n \"Georgina...this is horrible...\"\n \"It was worse before.\" I spoke flippantly, hoping to deflect his worry and realizing I\u0027d only increased it now.\n \"Worse?\"\n I tugged the robe up and turned back around. \"Mei healed it. I\u0027m fine.\"\n \"Yeah, it seems that way.\"\n \"Look, it\u0027s nothing you have to worry about.\"\n \"Not worry about?\" His eyes were filled with incredulity. \"Even when you\u0027re...normal...a demon could still kill you, right?\"\n \"Yeah.\"\n Seth put his hand to his forehead and sighed. \"This is what it\u0027s like, isn\u0027t it?\"\n \"What?\"\n \"What you went through with me. Living with the fear that I could die. Having it tear you apart.\"\n I didn\u0027t answer right away. \"You don\u0027t have to worry about me. This\u0027ll work out.\"\n \"Did this...did Nanette do this because of your investigating?\"\n I nodded, then crooked him a wry smile. \"Still like how brave I am?\"\n He stepped closer to me and looked me up and down in a way that was so serious, my smile faded. \"Even after this, you aren\u0027t going to stop, are you? You\u0027re going to keep pushing to find Jerome?\"\n \"Do you want me to stop?\" This was almost like my earlier conversation with Dante, when he\u0027d made it clear he thought I was a fool for continuing with my quest.\n Seth\u0027s answer was a long time in coming. \"I don\u0027t want you to get hurt. But I understand you, and I know why you have to do this...and it\u0027s still part of that strange, brave nature of yours that\u0027s so...\"\n He didn\u0027t finish, but I saw the anguish in his eyes, the worry and heartache over something happening to me. It was mingled with something else, though. Pride. Affection. I put my arms around him again, wanting to comfort him now. \"Hey, hey. It\u0027s going to be okay. I\u0027ll be okay.\"\n His hands rested on my hips, careful of my back, but honestly, I barely noticed. My attention was on his lips, pressed against my cheek. \"Georgina, Georgina,\" he breathed against my skin. \"You are...incredible.\"\n And like in the car, I don\u0027t know who exactly was to blame, but our lips met and were kissing again. Unlike before, we didn\u0027t break apart out of shock. We kept kissing. And kissing. His lips were intoxicating and felt like they\u0027d been designed especially for mine. Our bodies pressed against one another, though his embrace was still gentle. As the kiss continued, that same sensation came back to me: this was purely a kiss. Just an expression of love between two people with no dire side effects, no soul stealing. The longer it went on, the more amazed I was. By now, as a succubus, I would have begun to taste his energy and feel his thoughts. But not now. I was alone in my own head, savoring his body and not his soul.\n We pulled back slightly, and he moved his hands up to the side of my face, smoothing my hair away and touching my cheek. \"Georgina. You are...beautiful.\"\n We kissed again, and it was so sweet, so pure, that it didn\u0027t seem possible. I hadn\u0027t had a physical experience that could really be called sweet or pure since...well, since my mortal days. But this was. And by pure, I didn\u0027t mean non-sexual...because my body was definitely awake and yearning for his. But, it was pure in the sense that there were no ulterior machinations here, just our feelings. My love for him was the turn-on, and as his hands ran down my arms and back to my hips, it was the knowledge that it was Seth that made it all so powerful.\n His hands carefully moved down to the robe\u0027s tie and undid the knot. He broke the kiss and studied my face as he hesitantly, almost reverently, slipped the robe off me. It hit the floor, and I stepped away from it. Seth moved with me, running his fingers along my arms, leaning down to kiss my neck. I tilted my head back as my own hands began pushing up his T-shirt. When I had it half-way, he paused to push it up the rest of the way.\n Then his hands were on my waist once more, sliding down and feeling the curve of my hips. I had on plain cotton panties-sexily cut, at least-and his fingertips traced the edges down along my thighs, every touch soft yet quivering with pent-up energy. I don\u0027t think I was being quite as gentle. I was hungry to touch him, eager as I ran my hands along his chest and the lean muscles of his stomach. I wanted to kiss it and taste it and lose myself in all things Seth.\n I began backing up toward my bedroom, and he followed, turning hesitant once we reached the bed and I started to sit. \"You can\u0027t...\" he began.\n \"I can lie down,\" I said, doing exactly that. \"I just can\u0027t slam my back down or anything.\"\n After watching me for a moment, making sure I spoke the truth, Seth took off his jeans and lay down next to me. I rolled slightly to my side, pressing back to him. We resumed kissing, doing no more than that, just letting our nearly bare bodies wrap around each other. Having all this skin touching between us was heady. Never, never had I imagined it could really happen. Our hands explored each other, feeling every line and curve we\u0027d always been denied. Every gesture between us was exquisite. Every caress was a prayer. We regarded each other\u0027s bodies with wonder and joy.\n When my hands slipped to the edges of his boxers, I found his own fingers were tugging at my panties. We hardly needed any communication, and once completely naked, I wrapped my arms around him, pulling him toward me and seeking the completion with him I\u0027d so long dreamed of.\n To my surprise, he pulled from my arms and scooted down the bed. \"What are you doing?\" I asked.\n \"This,\" he said.\n He smoothly pushed my legs apart, and I felt him shower my inner thighs with light, delicate kisses. Up and up his warm mouth moved until he made contact with my clit. I gasped softly at the fire that coursed through me from that light flick of the tongue. It was so light...yet so powerful. I\u0027d been so intoxicated with the simple fact that we could touch that I hadn\u0027t been consciously aware of just how aroused I had grown. I ached and was wet and nearly melted at his touch.\n He lifted his mouth up slightly. \"Do you know how long I\u0027ve dreamed about this? To be able to touch you? To taste you?\"\n I had little chance to ponder his rhetorical question because his lips returned to me, sucking and licking, somehow infinitely gentle and blazingly hot at the same time. I closed my eyes and lost myself in the pleasure of it, of Seth bringing me closer and closer to orgasm. As my muscles tightened and my cries grew more frequent, he intensified his movements, his tongue dancing and teasing harder and more rapidly.\n I wanted to hold off, to prolong this as I did his books, but I couldn\u0027t help it. My climax hit me hard and fast, and I moaned long and low as I came. All the while, Seth kept his mouth down there, refusing to let up as my body arched and trembled from the sparks of ecstasy that flowed through me. When my body finally quieted, he lifted himself up again and returned to my side, showering my chest with more of those tiny kisses.\n I brought my face to his, trading in the little kisses for one big one. His mouth tasted like me, and I opened my lips farther and farther as our tongues stroked each other. I might have come already, but I still burned between my legs and still needed him. I pressed myself against him, wrapping my legs around him so that there was almost no space between our hips.\n \"Georgina...\" he said warningly.\n It was another sign of how well we knew each other that I realized he wasn\u0027t worried about asking permission about what came next. He was worried about my back again. So, shifting over, I rolled him to his back and straddled him, looking down at him with a small smile. He gave me an answering one, amused by my ready solution. As we held gazes, I was again overwhelmed with the emotion of the experience, of how indescribable it was to finally touch someone I loved. I had been terrified at the thought of dying, but I realized then that I was only afraid of dying uselessly. For Seth, to save him, I would have gladly laid down my life. He was right. We were connected in something bigger than both of us.\n Empowered by that realization, I lowered my hips, joining us at last. I felt him enter me, felt him fill me up. We both paused then, neither breathing or moving, half-expecting something to happen or end this. Nothing did, and after that, I didn\u0027t hesitate any further. I slowly moved my hips up and down, savoring the feel of him in me and underneath me as he glided in and out. My hands were on his chest and his were on my hips. Our eyes were on each other, never wavering, never breaking contact.\n How to describe sex with Seth? It\u0027s difficult. It was unlike anything I\u0027d had in my existence as a succubus. Somewhere, in the back of my head, it resonated with memories of my marriage, when my husband and I had still been happy. Every other instance after that had been lacking...until now. Each movement and touch with Seth was a dream, a wonder.\n The intensity of our lovemaking steadily increased. My need for him grew stronger and stronger, and I rode him with a ferocity that was still tender and full of the love that burned between us. I loved the feel of him, loved how I could thrust him into me, hard and deep. And yet...\n \"It\u0027s not enough,\" I murmured. \"We\u0027re still not close enough.\" It might have been a foolish sentiment, considering we were as physically close as two people could be. But Seth understood.\n \"I know,\" he gasped. \"I know. We\u0027ll never be close enough.\"\n Joy lit his face then, and when he came, his body arched up toward mine. I leaned down and increased my rhythm and hardness, wanting so badly to be even closer and have as much of him in me as I could. His mouth parted in a soft moan that mirrored my earlier one, and when he started to instinctively close his eyes, he quickly opened them again to stay locked with my gaze. There was no looking away between us, no avoiding what we felt. As I stared into his eyes and felt his body\u0027s trembling fade, energy seemed to crackle between our souls in a way that had nothing to do with succubus soul-stealing.\n Carefully, I eased myself off him and lay down on my side again, draping my body over his. I was drowning in feeling and emotion.\n \"Georgina,\" he murmured, pulling me closer. \"You are the world.\"\n I\u0027d heard that somewhere before, but I was too overwhelmed to parse it much. I was too lost in Seth. Instead, what I said was unoriginal but absolutely true: \"I love you.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-heat-georgina-kincaid-4/page-17.html","bookId":2057,"book":{"id":2057,"title":"Succubus Heat (Georgina Kincaid #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Georgina Kincaid Book 4: Succubus Heat \n Which should be a good thing.
