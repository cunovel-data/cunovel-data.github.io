But lately, thanks to her foul mood over breaking up with bestselling writer Seth Mortensen, she\u0027s been so wicked that Seattle\u0027s uber-demon Jerome, decides to \"outsource\" Georgina to a rival--and have her spy for him in the process. Being exiled to the frozen north--okay, Vancouver--and leaving Seth in the cozy clutches of his new girlfriend is unpleasant enough. Then Jerome is kidnapped, and all immortals under his control mysteriously lose their powers. One bright spot: with her life-sucking ability gone, there\u0027s nothing to keep Georgina from getting down and dirty with Seth--nothing apart from his girlfriend that is. Now, as the supernatural population starts turning on itself, a newly mortal Georgina must rescue her boss and figure out who\u0027s been playing them--or all hell will break loose. . .","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/succubus-heat-georgina-kincaid-4.jpg","author":"Richelle Mead","type":"Fantasy","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":27,"category":{"id":18,"name":"Fantasy","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
