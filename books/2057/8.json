This is Grace.\"\\n\\n I waited patiently for Mei\u0027s complementary greeting. When it didn\u0027t come, I asked in surprise, \"It\u0027s just you? Not Mei?\"\\n\\n Grace\u0027s voice, while as flat as usual, held the tiniest puzzled note in it. \"Why would Mei be here?\"\\n\\n It apparently hadn\u0027t occurred to her that I had never received a call or a visit from either of them alone. They always functioned as a unit, kind of giving the impression that the fabric of the universe might rip open if they were ever apart. This was as weird as them nearly accepting coffee the other day.\\n\\n \"Never mind. What\u0027s up?\"\\n\\n \"Jerome wanted me to tell you that he is...pleased.\"\\n\\n \"Over what?\"\\n\\n \"Over you successfully embarrassing Cedric.\"\\n\\n \"But I didn\u0027t-\" I bit my lip, suddenly wondering if I should be so quick to deny my involvement. Jerome hadn\u0027t been happy with me recently. While the stupid spectacle at Queen Elizabeth Park had put me on Cedric\u0027s shit list, it might very well take me off Jerome\u0027s and hasten my permanent return to Seattle. I stayed silent.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s glad you took his talk to heart,\" Grace continued. \"Although, he does wish to remind you that you being sent to Cedric is supposed to be a gesture of good will. So try not to be too efficient. Jerome encourages you to keep up with these small jabs but to remember that you do ultimately want this group undone.\"\\n\\n I sighed. \"Noted.\"\\n\\n Grace disconnected. Great. This was all I needed. Jerome thought I was guilty too-of trying to score extra credit with him.\\n\\n Cedric had told me I could find Isabelle at a jazz club a few miles from my hotel. It was over on a street lined with clubs and bars, and the excitement and energy in the air as I walked toward Isabelle\u0027s hangout was palpable. It was Saturday night, after all, and the streets teemed with humans eager and excited for life and love. I couldn\u0027t see their souls or energy the way an imp like Hugh could, but I didn\u0027t need to. It was apparent in the way they moved and talked and eyed each other for potential hook-ups. Even after my recent tryst, being in this electric atmosphere made me itch for another conquest. I\u0027d have to cruise these clubs once I\u0027d concluded business with Isabelle.\\n\\n The jazz club was small and dark, exactly the way you expected such places to be. All the tables were filled, and lots of people stood by the bar or along the wall. I didn\u0027t have any trouble finding Isabelle, though. The signature of a greater immortal filled up a place like this. Hers made me think of sunlight shining through crystals, fracturing into sparkles of color.\\n\\n She sat alone at a corner table. Most obviously single women in there were being hit on-in fact, I got a number of appraising looks as I walked through-but no one other than the wait staff seemed to notice Isabelle. It reminded me of how no one ever noticed Jerome\u0027s resemblance to John Cusack. Isabelle wore a long blue dress with spaghetti straps, surprisingly risqu¨¦ for an angel. Her hair was sunny blond and worn loose to her lower back-not unlike a golden cloak, I thought wryly.\\n\\n She sensed me, of course, and didn\u0027t seem surprised at all when I sat down across from her. With a smile, she glanced up and crooked a finger toward the nearest waiter. He hurried over and took my gimlet order. Once he was gone, Isabelle turned her attention on me.\\n\\n \"So. Jerome\u0027s succubus.\"\\n\\n Cedric had called me the same thing when we first met. I kind of resented my identity being based on my association with-or rather, possession by-someone else.\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" I said. She watched me pleasantly, neither cold nor friendly. With angels, you never knew which extreme you might get. Mostly, she looked curious, so I figured I could get right down to business. \"So I-\"\\n\\n \"Shh.\"\\n\\n \"Wh-\"\\n\\n She held up her hand, dark eyes focusing on something beyond me. The band was in the middle of a song, and the trumpet player had just put the instrument to his lips. A long, high note came out, kicking off what turned into a mournful solo. When he finished a minute or so later, I turned back to Isabelle and saw the waiter had brought my gimlet. The angel\u0027s face was alight with wonder-and wistfulness.\\n\\n \"Did you hear that?\" she asked me. \"Those notes weren\u0027t complicated, yet he managed to put so much into them. His heart, his emotions, his soul. A world of sorrow, exquisite agony...all in those few notes.\" She took a sip of her wine. \"You can\u0027t do that. Not even I can do that-not the way he did.\"\\n\\n Her words surprised me, but I knew exactly what she meant. Part of the reason I was always a little in awe of Seth\u0027s books was because he, as a mortal, had a talent that an immortal like me never could possess. \"Only humans have the gift of creation,\" I murmured.\\n\\n Her eyebrows rose slightly, and she smiled. \"Yes, exactly. So tell me, what can I do for you, Jerome\u0027s succubus?\"\\n\\n I felt a little weird interrogating her now. There was something a little sad and vulnerable about her that made her appealing. Nonetheless, I pushed forward. Angels and demons came from the same stock. Both were good at making you believe what they wanted. \"You...you know about those so-called Satanists, right? The Army of Darkness?\"\\n\\n Isabelle\u0027s smile twitched. \"Great movie, silly cult. Did you have anything to do with their display today? I really liked the goat mask.\"\\n\\n I shook my head. \"Actually, I was wondering if you had anything to do with it.\"\\n\\n \"Me?\" She laughed. \"I only wish I could think up things that good-but there we are again: humans and creation. Why do you ask?\"\\n\\n \"Because they say they\u0027re being directed by an angel.\" I gave her an abridged version of what the group had told me.\\n\\n \"And you assume they literally meant an angel?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m trying not to assume anything. But I think someone or something is directing them, and your side has as good a reason as any to stir up trouble for Cedric and make the authorities on all sides come down on him.\"\\n\\n \"And your side has just as good a reason. Demons try to oust each other all the time.\"\\n\\n I tapped my nails along my glass\u0027s edge and eyed her warily. \"And you haven\u0027t actually answered my question,\" I pointed out. \"You haven\u0027t directly denied being involved.\" Angels couldn\u0027t technically lie, but oh, they were masters at not always telling the truth.\\n\\n Isabelle finished off her wine and smiled at me again. \"Oh, you are delightful. This is just like being on a TV cop show. No wonder Carter likes you so much.\"\\n\\n I sighed in exasperation, realizing I was going to get nowhere. Fucking angels.\\n\\n Her grin dimmed a little, but she was still clearly amused. \"Look, Georgina,\" she said. She knew my name; no real surprise. \"I like you. You\u0027re clever and endearing, but here\u0027s how it is: I don\u0027t want to see Cedric leave Vancouver. I like him. And anyway, that saying about keeping your enemies close is true. I know him, I understand him. And when you\u0027re playing a game like ours, the better you know the pieces on the board, the better you\u0027ll do. I don\u0027t want to have to live with an archdemon I don\u0027t know, one who\u0027s a lot more unpleasant than he is.\" A new glass of wine had been delivered, and she paused to take a sip. \"And that\u0027s the truth.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know what to say. I wanted to believe her but had no idea if I could. I simply sighed again.\\n\\n \"What are you thinking?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"I wish I could believe you when you say you aren\u0027t involved. Even with the whole not-lying thing, I don\u0027t know that I can. I don\u0027t think that I can trust anyone.\"\\n\\n \"That,\" she said firmly, \"is absolutely something I agree with: you can\u0027t trust anyone. On any side. Everyone\u0027s got their own agenda, and there\u0027s something in the air right now-it\u0027s like a building storm, to use a clich¨¦. Be careful.\" Her face looked momentarily troubled, and then she relaxed again as her attention returned to the stage. \"Ah, the soloist is back.\"\\n\\n I slid my empty glass to the center of the table. I started to take out some cash too, but she waved it away. \"Thanks for talking,\" I told her, rising from my chair. Suddenly, I hesitated. \"You mentioned Carter. I don\u0027t suppose...I don\u0027t suppose you know where he\u0027s been lately?\"\\n\\n I\u0027d never thought I would utter those words. Carter had tormented me for years with his unsolicited, cryptic advice. He\u0027d particularly loved to comment about Seth and me, as though he had some special interest in our relationship. Since it had ended, I\u0027d hardly seen Carter at all. He used to come hang out with my friends and me but had only surfaced a couple of times in the last few months.\\n\\n Isabelle smiled. \"He\u0027s closer than you think.\"\\n\\n \"Typical angel answer,\" I groaned. I turned around to leave and then yelped.\\n\\n Carter stood by the club\u0027s entrance.\\n\\n Abandoning Isabelle, I hurried across the crowded room. Oblivious to the dress code, Carter wore his typical grungy clothing, ratty jeans and a plain gray T-shirt. A flannel shirt was tied around his waist, and his blond hair could have handled a good washing and brushing. He smiled expectantly at my approach and stepped outside to the crowded street. I followed.\\n\\n \"What are you doing here?\" I asked, taking out my cigarettes. I grabbed one for myself and then offered him the pack. He took one too.\\n\\n \"What are you doing here?\" he returned pleasantly.\\n\\n \"You know what I\u0027m doing here. Everyone knows what I\u0027m doing here.\" I fumbled in my purse for my new lighter and found a matchbook instead. I pulled it out. Mark\u0027s Mad Martini Bar. I\u0027d forgotten them.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" asked Carter, noting my frown.\\n\\n I shook my head. \"Nothing.\" I traded the matches for my lighter, and we lit up. \"You were lurking with your signature hidden,\" I continued. \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Element of surprise,\" he said. \"It was worth it to see your face.\"\\n\\n We walked past the club lines and drunken groups, no clear destination in mind-at least none that I knew of. \"You haven\u0027t been around in a while,\" I accused.\\n\\n \"Why, Daughter of Lilith, have you missed me?\"\\n\\n \"No! But I was starting to feel like you were only interested in me while I was dating Seth.\"\\n\\n \"Of course not.\" There was a long, overly nonchalant pause. \"So...have you talked to him lately?\"\\n\\n I rolled my eyes. \"You are only interested in Seth! You\u0027re going to have to let it go, Carter. Seth and I are finished. Why can\u0027t you obsess on me and my new boyfriend instead?\"\\n\\n \"Because you can do better.\"\\n\\n \"Everyone keeps saying that. But I\u0027m a succubus. How much better can I do?\"\\n\\n \"The fact that people keep telling you that should be answer enough.\"\\n\\n \"Seth broke up with me ,\" I said through gritted teeth. \"He doesn\u0027t want me anymore, end of story.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, come now. Do you really believe that?\"\\n\\n \"Seeing as I was there at the break-up? Yes.\"\\n\\n Carter tsked. \"Georgina, Georgina. You\u0027re letting your anger and other emotions cloud your reason, which is unfortunate since you\u0027re a lot smarter than people give you credit for. Go back and think. Why did Seth break up with you?\"\\n\\n I stared off at the far side of the street, refusing to look at him. \"Because he thought if we stayed together, we\u0027d both get hurt. That it would be better if we split, no matter how painful at the time.\"\\n\\n \"And you think that makes him a bad person?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" I turned back toward Carter. \"Because I didn\u0027t agree. I was willing to take the risk. He gave up.\"\\n\\n \"Sometimes it takes more courage to know when to retreat than to keep fighting.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think it could have taken that much courage. He ended up with Maddie pretty quickly.\" No matter how hard I tried, I couldn\u0027t keep the bitterness from my voice.\\n\\n \"That takes courage too, forcing yourself to start over with someone new, to keep moving on with your life.\"\\n\\n \"Seems more like a rebound to me.\"\\n\\n Carter took a long drag on his cigarette. \"Seth didn\u0027t leave and go to Maddie because he stopped loving you. If there were no complications in the world, you would be the one he chose. You are his ideal, his first choice.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not flattering to Maddie.\"\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t make her less. It just means he loves her differently. And when you decide you have to move on, that\u0027s how it is. Just because things don\u0027t work out, it doesn\u0027t mean there aren\u0027t other people you can\u0027t love. Love is too big a thing for you to go without it in life.\"\\n\\n \"Oh yes,\" I said. \"I have so missed these cryptic conversations.\"\\n\\n Carter crooked me a grin. \"I\u0027m glad to see you\u0027re back to your old self.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve missed the sarcasm too.\"\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027m serious. You weren\u0027t a lot of fun these last few months. You were kind of...\"\\n\\n \"...bitchy?\"\\n\\n He shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know. You were angry and depressed and frustrated. You stopped caring about the people around you. You weren\u0027t...well, you.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know me or what I am.\"\\n\\n \"I know you better than you think. I know you\u0027re still hurting and think the universe has given up on you. It hasn\u0027t. I also know that as far as all this demon business is concerned, your curiosity is going to tangle you up further in something you shouldn\u0027t be involved with in the first place. Jerome,\" he declared, \"is a fool.\"\\n\\n \"Do you know what\u0027s going on?\" I asked eagerly, coming to a stop. \"Who\u0027s leading that cult? Who\u0027s supposedly running this huge game that\u0027s going on that I can\u0027t see?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" said Carter, expression dark. \"I don\u0027t know any of that. But if I were you, I\u0027d get back to Seattle soon. Stay close to Jerome.\"\\n\\n \"He hates me right now.\"\\n\\n \"No, he doesn\u0027t. Stay close to him. He\u0027ll protect you. If he can\u0027t...well, I will. If I can.\"\\n\\n There was nothing romantic in his offer of protection. It wasn\u0027t spoken with chivalrous fierceness. His manner was uneasy, like he was dealing with a last resort. I also couldn\u0027t help but replay his last words: if I can . Angels-or demons-didn\u0027t use the word \"if\" very often.\\n\\n \"What do you mean if-\"\\n\\n \"Go back home, Daughter of Lilith.\" He tipped his head back to stare at the night sky, blew smoke into the air, and then looked down at me with his silvery gray eyes. \"We\u0027ll talk soon.\"\\n\\n He dropped the cigarette to the sidewalk and vanished.\\n\\n I glanced around, worried someone had seen us, but we\u0027d walked far from the partiers. I stamped out the cigarette, turned, and headed back in the direction of all the nightlife to go find some guys I\u0027d noticed checking me out. A night with drunken men might still leave me feeling hollow, but at least their motives were easier to understand than angels\u0027. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-heat-georgina-kincaid-4/page-8.html","bookId":2057,"book":{"id":2057,"title":"Succubus Heat (Georgina Kincaid #4)","description":"Storyline: Georgina Kincaid Book 4: Succubus Heat \\n Which should be a good thing.
