{"id":110299,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"Jerome was waiting for me in my apartment as soon as I stepped through the door.\n \"You have some nerve,\" he growled.\n I set my suitcase down. Normally that tone of voice would have set me hiding, but I was in no mood to listen to him now after my long drive-or rather, lack of a drive. There\u0027d been an accident that had put traffic at a standstill, and I\u0027d sat in my car for a very long and very annoying time.\n \"Look, Cedric told me to,\" I said, crossing my arms as though they might actually shield me from him. \"I didn\u0027t do anything wrong.\"\n \"You\u0027re not supposed to do what he says.\" Jerome sat on the arm of my couch and flicked his cigarette over a nearby ashtray, which I took as a great courtesy on his part. \"You\u0027re supposed to do what I say.\"\n \"He told me to go home. He didn\u0027t have anything for me to do until the Satanists had their breakfast meeting.\"\n Jerome\u0027s glare momentarily faltered. \"What are you talking about?\"\n \"What are you talking about? I\u0027m talking about Cedric sending me home early.\"\n \"And I\u0027m talking about your failure to notify me of his little stunt last night.\"\n Last night? I racked my brain. Last night I\u0027d been killing time shopping and destroying a man\u0027s self-esteem. To my knowledge, Cedric had done nothing after I left except continue his quest to destroy Wikipedia\u0027s informative empire.\n \"What\u0027d he do?\" I asked. \"I didn\u0027t even see him.\"\n Jerome didn\u0027t answer right away, his face thoughtful. I realized then he was reassessing his initial anger. It wasn\u0027t my early return that had upset him.\n \"There was a vampire brawl last night,\" he said finally. \"Somehow, a few of them thought their hunting ground lines had been rearranged. So they started roaming into others\u0027 areas...\"\n \"...and bad things ensued.\" Vampires were as territorial as demons in some ways. Vampires had specific areas that they guarded to stalk victims and were very touchy about other vampires using them. The archdemon of a region usually drew up vampiric lines and enforced them through force and will.\n \"Unfortunately, yes. Grace and Mei are still sorting it out.\"\n A panicked thought suddenly struck me. \"Are Cody and Hugh okay?\"\n He shrugged. \"A little bruised and battered, but nothing that won\u0027t heal on its own.\"\n My fear was unfounded, of course. Lesser immortals, like vampires and succubi, couldn\u0027t kill each other, and we healed extremely quickly. Still, the instinct to worry about my friends was one that would never leave me. \"Why were you yelling at me over this? I certainly didn\u0027t have anything to do with it.\"\n \"Because the vampires who thought they\u0027d been reassigned got official notification that said they had: a stamped and sealed demonic missive. They thought it was from me.\"\n \"But it wasn\u0027t,\" I guessed, seeing where he was going with this. Jerome had the area comfortably parceled out and would have no desire to change the status quo. He was too lazy. \"There was no name?\"\n \"No, clearly. But they don\u0027t need it-not if the seal is good. It was, and only another demon could have drawn something like that up.\"\n \"And so you assumed Cedric did it,\" I finished.\n Jerome nodded. \"Yes, and I\u0027m going to let him know exactly what I think of this. I\u0027m not happy over that-or you slacking off in reporting his activities to me.\"\n \"You\u0027re giving my spying ability more credit than I deserve here,\" I warned. \"It\u0027s kind of limited. He\u0027s not really sharing his inner secrets with me, and anyway, he already knows that\u0027s what you want me to do.\"\n \"Of course he does.\"\n I sighed. \"Look, if you want my opinion...\" The look Jerome gave me suggested he really didn\u0027t put a lot of stock in my opinion. \"...I don\u0027t think Cedric\u0027s the type to do anything like that. He\u0027s more interested in Web surfing.\"\n \"After all this time with demons, you really should know better than that, Georgie.\" Jerome smashed his cigarette into the ashtray and stood up.\n \"Yeah, yeah, I know, you sound just like Nan-\" I frowned. His wording had tickled a memory. \"Oh, I do have some info for you. Cedric was meeting with Nanette.\"\n Jerome had been straightening his sleeve, but his head jerked toward me at the mention of the archdemoness\u0027s name. \"Nanette?\" The word was carefully enunciated, icy in its tone.\n I relayed what I knew. Jerome\u0027s face grew dark as I spoke. Whatever his thoughts on the new development were, however, he didn\u0027t share them with me. \"Looks like you might be doing your job after all.\" He paused. \"But why are you back?\"\n \"There\u0027s nothing to do until Saturday. Cedric sent me home.\" I held my breath, waiting for him to blow up, but it didn\u0027t come.\n \"Well, seeing as you aren\u0027t being too much of a bitch for a change, I suppose that\u0027s okay.\" By that wording, I was apparently still being kind of a bitch.\n Jerome vanished.\n Aubrey immediately came out from behind the couch, giving me the censuring look cats always give owners who have been away for a while. I knelt down and scratched her chin. She was solid white with a few black specks on her forehead, often giving the impression that she couldn\u0027t keep her head clean.\n \"Yeah, I know,\" I told her. \"Believe me, I don\u0027t want to go back there either.\"\n Glancing at the clock, I saw that it was dinnertime. Too early to see the vampires quite yet, particularly since the days were getting longer. I\u0027d have to wait until after sunset to get their version of the bloodsucking showdown. I gave Aubrey a few more conciliatory pats and then straightened up to call Dante. He didn\u0027t answer, and I wondered if he actually had a customer for a change. When not concocting vile spells, he made his living giving fake Tarot and palm readings. I left a message, telling him I was back.\n With time on my hands, I started fretting about Emerald City. I knew the bookstore really could function without me, but the motherly instinct kicked in nonetheless. And since I did have the time, I decided to go over and check on things.\n As expected, all was well. It was almost seven, and people on their way home from work were stopping in to pick up things. Business was steady but not crazy.\n \"Georgina! You\u0027re back.\"\n I\u0027d been watching the registers from a distance and turned to see Maddie standing behind me, lugging a cardboard display for a new book coming out tomorrow. I smiled. No matter how hard things had been for me with her and Seth, there was something about her bright, open personality that could lighten dark moods.\n \"For a while. I just wanted to check on things.\"\n She grinned back. \"That\u0027s just like you. Get time off, and come back to work. How are things? Still crazy?\"\n I shrugged. \"Yeah, a little. But it\u0027s nothing I can\u0027t manage. I\u0027m hoping it\u0027ll improve soon.\"\n \"Is it something that might improve with a drink?\" She wore a mischievous look, and I couldn\u0027t help but laugh.\n \"Only if I\u0027m drinking alone. You\u0027re still here for a couple more hours.\"\n \"Nope. I had to come in early to cover someone, so Janice is going to close.\"\n It was always nice if a manager could close, but Janice was certainly competent enough. I hesitated. I\u0027d been avoiding Maddie since Christmas, but before Seth, I\u0027d always really liked her a lot. We\u0027d had a lot of good times together, and our personalities clicked well. Seth wasn\u0027t here now, and a drink suddenly seemed like an even better way to pass the time than doing managerial things when I wasn\u0027t actually required to do them.\n \"Okay.\"\n She finished up, and about fifteen minutes later, we stepped outside. I got a cigarette out automatically, then paused. \"Do you mind?\"\n \"Nah. I don\u0027t like them, but it\u0027s okay. Where do you want to go?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" I reached for my lighter, remembered it was out, and pulled out the matches instead. I ran my fingers over its cover and frowned. \"You want to go to Mark\u0027s Mad Martini Bar?\"\n Mark\u0027s was at the top of Queen Anne Hill, making for a rather steep hike. Living around here, I did it fairly regularly, but Maddie was breathing hard when we reached the bar.\n \"Man,\" she said. \"I need to go to the gym more.\"\n I held the door open for her. \"Do this every day, and you won\u0027t need to.\"\n \"I think I need a little more than that.\" Her weight was a continual source of worry for her. \"I think I need to pick up some weird sport. You want to start playing squash with me?\"\n \"Why squash?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. Never tried it. Figured I should.\"\n Along with the other changes in her life, Maddie had recently adopted an attitude of getting out there and trying new things. Before my recent funk, I\u0027d had kind of a similar view. Faced with centuries of existence, I\u0027d found experimenting with new activities was a great distraction. There was always something new to learn in the world.\n Mark\u0027s was dimly lit, done in matte black d¨¦cor. I flipped through the expansive drink menu, which upheld the restaurant\u0027s name. When the waiter came around, I ordered a martini called First Blush: white chocolate liqueur, Chambord, and vodka. The menu called for Stoli, but I asked for Grey Goose.\n \"You ever considered dancing?\" I asked Maddie. \"It can be a good workout. You\u0027re less likely to get hit in the head too.\"\n Maddie had ordered Sing the Blues: Blue Curacao, pineapple juice, and Ketel One. Her face lit up.\n \"I\u0027ve always wanted to. Doug said you used to teach swing at the bookstore.\"\n \"Yeah, I did some group lessons last fall. My friend Cody helped me.\" A pleasant wave of nostalgia swept me as I recalled those days. Things had been simpler, and I\u0027d had a lot of fun teaching my friends and co-workers while doing one of my favorite activities.\n \"I wish I\u0027d been there,\" she said wistfully. \"I\u0027m kind of uncoordinated, but you know...if I don\u0027t try, how will I learn?\"\n \"Maddie, you should be doing motivational speaking.\"\n She laughed. \"I don\u0027t know about that. But I\u0027d do dance lessons if you ever taught again. Hint, hint.\"\n The waiter returned with our drinks. I nearly died when I tasted mine. It was an 80 proof, raspberry dream. \"I don\u0027t know. The staff pretty much learned all they could with swing.\"\n \"Then teach something else. Doug says you know every kind of dance in the world. I\u0027d help you organize it.\"\n \"Maybe I\u0027ll do salsa or something,\" I told her, not sure if I meant it. \"When all this drama\u0027s over.\"\n \"Is there anything I can do to help? You know that I\u0027m here if you need something.\"\n The earnestness and compassion on her face made a lump form in my throat. I\u0027d spent the last few months hating her, but her friendship and faith in me had never faltered. Suddenly feeling guilty, I glanced away from her eyes.\n \"Nah, don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ll deal with it.\" Silence fell, silence that bothered me immensely. I felt a need to give something back to her for her kindness. My thoughts from a few nights ago about moving flashed into my head. I glanced back up. \"Maybe you can help me find a new place, though.\"\n As I\u0027d hoped, her face grew eager at the proposal. \"Really? You\u0027re going to move?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know for sure. Just thought it might be time for a change.\"\n Maddie became even more excited. \"What are you looking for?\"\n \"Not sure about that either,\" I admitted. \"The only thing I\u0027m sure of is that I want to try something outside of Queen Anne.\"\n \"Okay, that\u0027s a good start. How big? New construction or historic? Do you want to keep renting? The condo market\u0027s flooded, you know. Great time to buy.\"\n I tried to keep a straight face but couldn\u0027t. \"Were you a real estate agent in another life?\"\n \"No! I just think it\u0027s exciting, that\u0027s all. I want to help.\"\n \"Okay. I could rent or buy. It would depend on the place.\"\n \"What\u0027s your price range? If you don\u0027t mind me asking?\"\n I hesitated, wondering if I should let on to the truth about my finances. I decided it didn\u0027t matter. \"Well...let\u0027s put it this way. I\u0027ve got a lot of savings.\"\n \"Fair enough.\" Despite the rapid rate she was drinking, there was a sharp, businesslike air to her. \"You want a similar kind of neighborhood? Shops? Restaurants?\"\n \"Yeah, I wouldn\u0027t mind that.\"\n \"Anything else?\"\n \"I told you, I haven\u0027t thought much about it.\"\n She sighed in frustration. \"You\u0027ve gotta help me out here. Anything you\u0027ve been wanting for a long time? Something you\u0027ve missed?\"\n Unbidden, a memory of my childhood came to me. The Cyprian town I\u0027d lived in returned to me in startling clarity, its colors, smells, and airs.\n \"I grew up around beaches,\" I said softly. \"Sun and surf.\" I shook myself out of the wistful memory, feeling a bit embarrassed at my dreamy state. \"But I\u0027m in the wrong place for that.\"\n \"Yeah,\" she agreed. \"You\u0027d have to move to California for that.\"\n We had another round of drinks and talked about other things, and to my surprise, I had a really great time. I remembered now why I liked Maddie so much. She was so easy to talk to, so funny and smart. I didn\u0027t have a lot of female friends, and there was a big difference between her and the guys I normally hung out with. Women needed other women sometimes.\n I was signing my credit card bill when Seth walked over to our table.\n Maddie looked up, beaming. \"Hey, sweetie.\" She stood up and kissed him, something that unnerved both Seth and me. All of a sudden, the warm and pleasant feeling that had been building within me shattered. Maddie glanced at me explanatorily. \"I called Seth to get a ride while you were in the bathroom.\"\n I smiled tightly. \"Ah.\"\n Maddie turned back to him. \"You\u0027re missing out. This place has great drinks. You sure you don\u0027t want to break the rules? We could stay another round.\"\n \"Actually, I need to go,\" I said, thinking of few things more agonizing than drinking with the two of them.\n \"And I\u0027m not ready to break the rules,\" said Seth, avoiding my eyes. \"Besides, I\u0027ve got work to do.\"\n Maddie looked only moderately disappointed. \"Oh, well. No problem. Let me run to the bathroom, and we\u0027ll go. We\u0027ll give you a ride, Georgina.\"\n I should have run away then and there, but Maddie dashed off quickly, and I felt it would be rude to leave without saying good-bye to her. Seth sat down in her chair and clasped his hands in front of him. Our usual wall of awkwardness slammed down between us.\n \"I don\u0027t need a ride,\" I said abruptly.\n Seth glanced up at me. \"It\u0027s a long walk.\"\n \"Not really. It\u0027s only six blocks.\"\n \"Yeah, but you\u0027ve been drinking.\"\n I scoffed. \"I had two drinks. I\u0027m hardly going to walk into traffic, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re worried about.\"\n \"No, but it\u0027s no problem for me. I just want to make sure you get home okay.\" It was one of those rare times when his mild mood had been replaced by something more adamant. For whatever reason, that ratcheted up the anger within me.\n \"I\u0027ll be fine,\" I snapped. \"It\u0027s not your job to look after me anymore.\"\n \"Georgina, please.\"\n \"Please what? You know I\u0027m right.\"\n \"You\u0027re making this into a bigger deal than it is. It doesn\u0027t always have to be about us.\"\n \"Of course it does...I mean, inasmuch as there is an us. You got out. I\u0027m not your concern.\"\n \"I can still worry about you. Still care.\"\n I leaned forward, possibly emboldened by my martinis. \"You made it perfectly clear how much you care, and that\u0027s fine. I\u0027ve got a whole new life now.\"\n His look turned wry. \"Yeah, your new life seems great.\"\n That incensed me further, largely because I wasn\u0027t really convinced my new life was all that great either. \"It is. I can do whatever I want now. I don\u0027t have to worry about hurting your delicate sensibilities when I sleep with someone or having to modify our dates to boring things that don\u0027t take you out of your comfort zone or interfere with your writing schedule.\"\n It was horrible of me. Mean, mean, mean. I would have expected him to flinch, to look hurt. Instead, he fought back.\n \"And I don\u0027t have to worry about being hypocritically judged for being both too boring and too risky. I also don\u0027t have to wonder anymore if everything I\u0027m being told is a half-truth or an outright lie.\"\n That made me flinch. It was also when Maddie showed back up. She tried to cajole me into a ride, but I firmly refused-a bit more harshly than I needed to with her. She looked a little abashed, but I was too upset over Seth\u0027s words to care too much. I left, storming down the hill so hard, it was a wonder my footsteps didn\u0027t make the ground shake. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-heat-georgina-kincaid-4/page-5.html","bookId":2057,"book":{"id":2057,"title":"Succubus Heat (Georgina Kincaid #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Georgina Kincaid Book 4: Succubus Heat \n Which should be a good thing.
