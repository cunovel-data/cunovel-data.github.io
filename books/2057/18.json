{"id":110312,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"When it was over, I rested my cheek against his chest while still staying mostly on my side. His heart beat heavy beneath my hands, and the smell of his skin and sweat nearly overpowered me. I lay there, perfectly still, scarcely daring to breathe. I was afraid that if I moved too much, I\u0027d break this spell, this dream that I\u0027d somehow stumbled into.\n Slowly, carefully, Seth ran his fingers through my hair, idly twining the strands into loops. He let his hand drop and shifted slightly, just enough to press a kiss to my forehead. I exhaled and snuggled closer, realizing that I really wasn\u0027t going to wake from this dream.\n At least, that\u0027s what I thought until his cell phone rang.\n The ring was \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" by U2, not a particularly hard or jarring song but one that made me flinch anyway. For a moment, we each held our breath, both of us frozen. I wanted the phone to disappear off the face of the earth, to get smote the way I kept fearing some demon would smite me. I needed it to go away because if it kept ringing, it meant none of this was real. That we were going to have to face reality.\n But it was already too late. The spell was broken. The phone was reality.\n \"You should answer that,\" I said.\n He hesitated for the space of two heartbeats, sighed, and then slowly disentangled himself from me, still careful of my back. Sitting on the side of the bed, he reached down and pulled the cell phone from his jeans pocket. I shifted over, staying propped up on one elbow, admiring the shape of his body, even as a strange, bittersweet feeling began spilling through my heart. I knew, without knowing how I knew, that it was Maddie.\n \"Hey. Yeah...I got caught up with...um...\" Seth paused, and I sensed something monumental about to take place. \"I got an idea for this latest chapter.\"\n I closed my eyes. In all the time I\u0027d known him, I\u0027d never heard Seth outright lie.\n \"Right. Yeah. Okay. Um, if I leave now, I can probably make it in...oh, twenty minutes. Mmm-hmm. You want me to pick you up, or...? Okay. See you there.\"\n He disconnected and continued sitting with his back to me, clasping the phone in his hands. Although he sat up straight, he had the air of someone hunched over, weary with defeat.\n \"You have to go?\" I asked.\n He looked back at me, anguish on his face. \"Georgina...\"\n I managed a weak smile. \"It\u0027s okay. I wasn\u0027t tricked here. I understand the situation.\"\n \"I know, but I want you to realize that it wasn\u0027t...that I didn\u0027t...\"\n He didn\u0027t need to finish. One of the things I\u0027d always loved about Seth was his open, honest nature. Occasionally he\u0027d been able to hide his feelings from me, but more often than not, they shone through on his features. This was one of those times. With a single look, I saw what was in his heart, that he hadn\u0027t had sex with me because I was easy or available. He\u0027d done it because of how he felt about me, because he loved-still loved-me. It made all of this that much worse.\n \"I know,\" I said softly.\n After one more kiss to my forehead, he put on his clothes. I watched each move hungrily, uncertain if I\u0027d ever see anything like it again. When he was dressed and ready to go, he sat beside me on the bed, playing with my hair again. Again, those golden brown eyes spilled over with emotion. He was overcome and confused. I was too, but for his sake, I tried to appear strong and articulate.\n \"It\u0027s okay,\" I said. \"It was great. Amazing...but I understand that we shouldn\u0027t have and that we can\u0027t ever...\" So much for articulation.\n \"Yeah,\" he agreed.\n \"It was just this once. And it was perfect.\"\n \"Just this once,\" he repeated.\n I couldn\u0027t read his voice, but something told me he wasn\u0027t entirely happy about that. Neither was I, but honestly, what could we do? We\u0027d succumbed to passion, and now he had to go back to his girlfriend. End of story.\n He tipped my head back, and our lips met in a soft, warm kiss. It was brief, only a few moments, but I felt that same, soul-deep connection that had consumed me during sex. He stood up and studied me for a few moments more, as though he might not ever see me again. I felt a little silly lying there naked, but his expression told me he thought I was beautiful.\n He left after that, and I stayed in bed, drunk on my own feelings. Aubrey joined me, curling up against my leg.\n \"Was that how it was supposed to be, Aubrey?\" I couldn\u0027t decide. Certainly the sex had been everything I\u0027d ever imagined with Seth. But this afterglow? It was a bit lacking. Nothing about the situation was normal. I had no prior experience to fall back on.\n After almost a half hour of staring at nothing and reaching no conclusions, I got out of bed. I was still reeling from what had happened, and my body burned with what Seth and I had done. I usually liked to shower after sex, but not today. I could smell Seth on me, his sweat and even a faint trace of the leather-and-apple cologne he used sometimes. I couldn\u0027t stand to wash him off yet, so I put the old cotton robe back on. Ratty or not, its fabric was soft against my bruised skin.\n As I was about to leave my room, I noticed the photo of the medallion on the floor. I picked it up, intending to set it on my nightstand, and froze. There was writing on it.\n Inked with a black Sharpie, neat handwriting read: Smoky quartz indicates earth or a oneness with the earth . The symbols on the medallion were circled, with lines drawn out from each one, leading to brief notes: this indicates an affinity for water, a harmonious, blending state; this is similar to the water one, except it\u0027s for the earth; this is a masking symbol, meant to shield the object it protects and keep the seal strong; this one\u0027s strange, indicates blankness or whiteness-maybe white sand or stones?; this is the symbol for tears-combined with the water sign, probably indicates salt water .\n I reread the notes three times. Where had they come from? When had this happened? I retraced my steps, trying to figure out when I\u0027d abandoned the picture. There\u0027d been no writing when I showed it to Dante. The most likely time would have been while I was out for food. Someone could have also theoretically broken into my home and done it while I was with Carter in the living room, but sneaking past the angel seemed pretty out there.\n Unless...was it possible Carter had helped me after all? He kept saying he couldn\u0027t; he\u0027d even directly denied involvement with my assorted rescues. But the timing here was awfully coincidental. I kept staring at the symbols, at the notes, and the pictures of the seal. Whoever had written this was irrelevant for now. If their notes were correct, then I needed to use them to find Jerome.\n Carter had said the seal served two purposes. One was to infuse the vessel with power. The other was to serve as a \"lock\" that could open the vessel and release Jerome. The parts of the seal itself were with the demon and the summoner, but the symbols should give some clues to the vessel\u0027s location. Supposedly, these symbols would have been used in hiding Jerome, infusing the vessel with a type of energy specific to the location that would help blend and mask Jerome\u0027s presence.\n An affinity with the earth, as well as markings for water-salt water, specifically. A lot of places that were infused with power tended to be wild, natural places, though some had become centers of civilization and activity. Pike Place Market in downtown Seattle, for example, was one such ancient place of power that had been completely built upon by humanity.\n But these...what did they indicate? Some place near salt water, apparently. The vessel was probably close enough to the water that the symbols would resonate and camouflage its location. And the earth location? Buried in the dirt maybe? Was Jerome buried on some beach near the ocean? Jerome\u0027s kidnappers wouldn\u0027t want to keep him too far away from them, but nonetheless, the Pacific flanked the entire western half of Washington. That was a lot of beach, and I knew there were a lot of places of power along there. I didn\u0027t know of any white sand beaches anywhere in the area; only further investigation could say for sure.\n Groaning, I lay back on my bed, still holding the picture. The notes had only narrowed down the locations, but that was still a lot of area to cover. Yet what could I do? I had to find the vessel, sooner rather than later, or else Seattle was going to have a new archdemon. Studying the photo further, I willed it to give me some more info. Nothing. Just the medallion, the mystery notes, and Mary\u0027s cataloging info at the top which told me little-\n I frowned, rereading her header. It was brief, just the materials, name, and date the medallion had been created and then picked up. But the date it had been finished...the date stuck in my head. Why? It was from a week ago. Something about that date was important, but I couldn\u0027t figure out why. It felt likes years had passed in this last week, but I nonetheless counted backward, reassessing my recent activities.\n There. The seal had been made the day after I\u0027d first gone to Vancouver...the day the vampire turf war had gone down. Would the seal\u0027s creation have triggered anyone\u0027s immortal radar? I didn\u0027t know, but if it had, Jerome, Grace, and Mei would have all been busy sorting out the ensuing vampire mess. Misdirection.\n From there, other things began to arrange themselves in my head. I thought back to the Army of Darkness, wondering what events their activities might line up against. The event in Queen Elizabeth Park matched the date the seal had been picked up. And the Army\u0027s impromptu visit to Seattle...? That had preceded Jerome\u0027s summoning, though no one would have wanted to direct attention to that, would they?\n The answer was here. I just couldn\u0027t quite make the pieces fit yet. The Army had staged their show. Jerome, Grace, and Mei had given it their full attention. Jerome had been summoned. Where had this game\u0027s other players been?\n I left the bed and its aching, alluring memories. Finding my cell phone, I dialed Kristin\u0027s number.\n \"Hi, Georgina,\" she said, pleasant but busy like always.\n \"Hey,\" I said. \"How\u0027s it going?\"\n \"Crazy.\" I could imagine the grimace on her face. \"Cedric\u0027s stressed to hell-no pun intended-with all these demons in the area. At least that...that succubus is distracting him.\"\n \"Tawny?\"\n \"Whatever her name is. Cedric\u0027s actually out with her right now.\" Bitterness and the tiniest hint of jealousy came through in Kristin\u0027s voice. I remembered her perpetual devotion to him-and the look on her face when he\u0027d asked Tawny out. I felt for her but had too many romantic hijinks of my own to deal with.\n \"Huh.\" I didn\u0027t really know what else to say. \"Look, I have a question for you. Do you know, did Cedric come to see Jerome the day the Army was down here?\"\n \"Yeah. Cedric came down after you left the message. I thought you knew.\"\n \"No...I only heard about it after the fact, and then, the whole summoning kind of took precedence.\"\n \"Why do you want to know?\"\n I hesitated. I liked Kristin, but she was clearly loyal to Cedric. I didn\u0027t think it\u0027d be wise to share my theories with her, like that the Army being in Seattle had provided a convenient reason for Jerome and Cedric to be together when Jerome got summoned. It occurred to me that I might very well owe Hugh an apology for my adamant denial of Cedric\u0027s involvement. Something else also occurred to me.\n \"Um, it\u0027s a long story,\" I said hastily. \"Do you know if he\u0027s been hanging out with Nanette a lot?\"\n \"Why?\" Her tone was quickly turning suspicious. She didn\u0027t like me interrogating her about her boss.\n \"Well...I told him the other day that I thought Nanette might be involved with Jerome\u0027s disappearance. He didn\u0027t think so, but he told her...and she got really pissed off. She, um.... well, let\u0027s just say she got physical, and I have the scars to prove it.\"\n My immortal friends had pointed out that Nanette\u0027s attack made her look guilty. If Cedric had done enough goading to make her angry when he told her, it could have very well sent her to me in a rage-and successfully shifted attention from him. Fuck. I didn\u0027t want another suspect in all of this. I didn\u0027t want it to be Cedric. Nanette had hitherto been a convenient explanation.\n Kristin was silent for several seconds. \"I didn\u0027t know that,\" she said quietly. \"Are you okay?\"\n \"Mostly. Mei healed the worst of it, but I\u0027m still a little sore.\"\n \"I can\u0027t imagine...Cedric would never have told her if he thought that was going to happen. He likes you. He wouldn\u0027t condone that. He couldn\u0027t have known. I\u0027m sorry.\"\n She was sincerely contrite, hurt at the thought that her boss-even if he was a demon and a servant of evil-could have been involved with something that had turned out so terrible.\n \"It\u0027s okay,\" I said. \"I\u0027ve gotta run, but thanks for the info. Things are kind of crazy here too, as you can imagine.\"\n We said our good-byes and disconnected. I flipped the cell phone around in my hand, feeling overwhelmed. Nanette wasn\u0027t off the table yet, but Cedric was right alongside her now as a culprit-maybe more so. If I had enough evidence, I could possibly take it to Grace and Mei...but I didn\u0027t have that yet. Besides, knowing who the culprit was wouldn\u0027t solve the immediate issue: finding Jerome.\n I glanced back at the photo, resting on my nightstand. Sore back or no, it looked like I had to do a little beachcombing.\n I nearly knocked Dante over when he came home that night.\n \"Succubus,\" he said, letting me wrap my arms around him. He was careful only to rest his hands on my hips. \"Happy to see you too.\"\n My eagerness was twofold. I was excited to see him because I wanted to pick his brain about the medallion and places of power. But also...well, while hanging around today, I\u0027d had a lot of time to think about Seth and what had happened between us. The memory of his body still made mine burn, and I grew breathless recalling that amazing connection and sense of rightness between us.\n And yet...whatever rightness had been between us, it had still been wrong. He was with Maddie-my friend. I\u0027d been upset when she and Seth had first slept together. I was no different. In fact, I\u0027d knowingly done it, which made it worse. Now there was Dante to consider. Dante, who despite that dark, scowling nature really did love me and wanted to win my regard as more than just someone I had sex with. This was where my future lay, not with Seth.\n I kissed Dante on the lips, lingering several seconds. \"I missed you.\"\n His smile turned wry. \"Don\u0027t look at me like that, or I\u0027m going to have a hard time remembering that you\u0027re injured and that I should keep my hands off you.\"\n Those words triggered a pang of guilt. My injuries certainly hadn\u0027t been enough to keep Seth off me. I could have told Dante that I was better, that it didn\u0027t matter, yet for whatever reason...I didn\u0027t.\n We broke apart, and I found the medallion picture for him. He stared incredulously as I showed him the phantom notes and explained my story.\n \"What, you have no idea how they got there or who did it?\"\n \"Nope, but at this point, I\u0027m not going to question it.\"\n He shook his head, face still shocked. \"Well. I wish I\u0027d known this before I left. Would have been a lot easier to just wait and have invisible helpers come leave clues.\"\n I recalled how he\u0027d gone out to see what he could find about the medallion. \"What\u0027d you turn up?\"\n He gestured at the picture. \"Same thing.\"\n I rested my hand over his. \"Sorry. I really appreciate your help. And if your research found the same thing, it means I can probably trust this.\"\n \"Maybe,\" he said, still not sounding happy about the wasted time. \"What are you going to do? Something crazy?\"\n \"Look for saltwater beaches, I guess.\"\n Dante let out a low whistle. \"There are a lot of those around here. Not to mention you have no way of identifying this vessel anyway.\"\n \"I know. But I\u0027ve got to start somewhere. Can you help me make a list?\"\n We got an atlas of the Pacific Northwest area from my car and laid it flat on the kitchen table. Scrutinizing every detail, we each marked as many places as we knew. Dante knew a lot more than me, which didn\u0027t particularly surprise me. I\u0027d once noted to Erik Lancaster that those who study religion tend to know more about it than those who practice it. Sometimes, I felt the same way about immortal affairs.\n We found twelve in all that were easy day trips-and many more beyond that. \"Looks like you\u0027ve got your work cut out for you,\" Dante mused. \"When are you going to look? Too dark now.\"\n I stared at the map with dismay. \"Tomorrow, I guess. Can you go with me?\" A psychic like him might able to sense something, as Carter had pointed out.\n He grimaced. \"Not tomorrow. I\u0027ve actually got a few appointments people have scheduled. Crazy, huh? I probably can go the next day or the day after, if you can wait. I\u0027d feel better if you didn\u0027t go alone.\"\n I was glad for his business but sad at the delay. \"I don\u0027t think I can wait. Don\u0027t worry, though. I\u0027ll find somebody.\"\n \"On the bright side,\" he said, trying to cheer me. \"I\u0027ll have money tomorrow. We can go out somewhere nice.\"\n I mustered a smile. \"Yeah, that\u0027ll be-oh, shit. I can\u0027t.\"\n \"What\u0027s going on?\"\n \"Fuck. I promised the people at the store I\u0027d teach salsa after work.\"\n \"Cancel,\" he said dismissively. My dance lessons didn\u0027t hold much importance, as far as he was concerned. \"Tell them you\u0027re sick.\"\n That wouldn\u0027t entirely be a lie...and yet, I hated to go back on my word. Furthermore, I could still see Maddie\u0027s radiant face, so excited and happy when I\u0027d agreed. How could I deny her that after what I\u0027d done to her today?\n \"No...I\u0027ve got to do it. Let\u0027s go eat out now. My treat.\"\n He drove us over to Belltown for some of Seattle\u0027s best seafood. Wine and conversation flowed, and I discovered I was healing by leaps and bounds. When we got back to my place later and went to bed, Dante snuggled up to me and kissed my neck.\n \"Looks like you\u0027re on the mend,\" he noted, moving his lips up to my earlobe. \"We could do it...I could be careful...\"\n All around us were the sheets and blankets where Seth and I had made love earlier. The thought nearly smothered me. God. I really should have washed the bedding. I swallowed and shifted position so that I didn\u0027t meet Dante\u0027s eyes. \"Maybe...but I\u0027d rather wait, so we can not be careful.\" I hoped there was enough of a seductive growl in my voice to make it believable.\n Dante sighed, fortunately unwilling to push me. \"Fair enough.\"\n He rolled over and left me to sleep, but it was a long time in coming. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-heat-georgina-kincaid-4/page-18.html","bookId":2057,"book":{"id":2057,"title":"Succubus Heat (Georgina Kincaid #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Georgina Kincaid Book 4: Succubus Heat \n Which should be a good thing.
