{"id":110317,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"Dante wasn\u0027t around when I got home, nor was he reachable by phone. That relieved me of any guilt I had about going out with Seth, meaning my only other obstacle was the accusatory look Roman gave me when we parted. I had no idea how he would spend his evening, and honestly, I didn\u0027t really want to know.\n The problem Seth and I had with going out was that we pretty much had to avoid the city. We knew people in the suburbs too, but the odds of running into anyone were a lot smaller. The rainy weather Roman and I had experienced in the afternoon had blown over, and we suddenly found ourselves in semi-warm conditions that made it almost possible to go without a coat. I would have read the fortuitous weather as a divine blessing, if not for the fact that I\u0027d given up on such beliefs long ago.\n To my astonishment, though, Seth said he wanted to go downtown and felt pretty confident we wouldn\u0027t be spotted. He drove us over to Belltown, parking underneath one of the many high-rise apartment buildings that seemed to be sprouting up there every day. A mysterious key let him inside, and the elevator took us all the way to the top floor.\n \"What is this?\" I asked when we entered a sprawling penthouse suite. It kind of made me wonder if I should have been setting my real estate aspirations in a different direction. I gave him a startled look. \"You don\u0027t own this, do you?\" Seth having a secret vacation home wasn\u0027t entirely improbable.\n \"Belongs to someone I know who\u0027s out of town. I called in a favor.\"\n \"You have friends I don\u0027t know?\"\n He gave me A Look, and I let the matter go. Besides, the place was so beautiful that I had plenty of distraction. The colors were all done in shades of navy and gray, and the furniture was plush and expensive. I especially liked the fact that the walls were decorated with huge reproductions of pre-Raphaelite work. Nowadays, abstract art was the trendy way to go, and it was nice to see something a little different.\n \"Wait\u0027ll you see the rest,\" said Seth, beckoning me out to the balcony.\n Or, well, \"balcony\" was the closest word I could come up with. It was practically half the size of my apartment and faced west, showing part of downtown\u0027s glittering array of lights and all of Puget Sound. I stared in wonder, watching a ferry move across the dark expanse of water.\n \"Wow.\" That about summed it up.\n We stood there for a few moments, and Seth\u0027s arm slipped around me. This high up, the unseasonable warmth had turned to seasonable gusts and coldness. I shivered, and Seth draped me in a blanket that had been neatly folded on a wrought-iron chair.\n \"Have a seat,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll be back with dinner.\"\n I grinned at the gallantry and sat at an ornate, candlelit glass table that still allowed me to take in the view. Waiting for Seth, I felt all sorts of strange feelings stir to life within me. This was it, I realized. I didn\u0027t know how I knew, but this was the end of whatever it was that we had right now. Maybe something new would take its place. Maybe we\u0027d never have anything again. Regardless, this moment was crystallized in time for me. Nothing like it would ever come again.\n Dinner turned out to be an array of tapenade and bread, as well as-to my shock-a bottle of wine. \"Is that whole thing for me?\" I asked.\n He shook his head. \"I\u0027ll have a glass.\"\n \"What? Starbucks, now this?\" I peered at the bottle to make sure it wasn\u0027t some kind of weird alcohol-free kind. Nope.\n \"It\u0027s a special occasion,\" he said with a smile, and I knew he\u0027d gotten the same vibe that I had, that this was the end of something. \"Besides, how can I live out the Rubaiyat if I don\u0027t have all the accoutrements?\"\n \"Of course. Your uber-romantic date would be based on a poem.\" I could already see him getting into quotation mode. He cleared his throat to speak.\n \"Here with a Loaf of Bread beneath the Bough\n A Flask of Wine, a Book of Verse-and Thou\n Beside me singing in the Wilderness-\n And Wilderness is paradise enow.\"\n I tsked. \"You\u0027ve got the bread, wine, and me...but no bough. And hardly the wilderness.\"\n \"It\u0027s the urban jungle,\" he argued.\n \"And no book of verse,\" I continued, liking my contrary role. Then I reconsidered. \"Although, I did finish All Fools Night .\"\n Seth\u0027s expression immediately grew serious. \"And?\"\n \"You already know. It was beautiful.\"\n \"No, I don\u0027t. It\u0027s a mystery every time-no pun intended. The words come out, but in the end...\" He shrugged. \"You never know how they\u0027ll be received, what people will think. I\u0027m always kind of surprised.\"\n \"What did the opening quote mean? The Kate Bush lyrics about making a deal with God?\"\n \"You should hear the cover of that song that Placebo did. It\u0027ll blow you away.\" Seth gave me a knowing look. \"You think there\u0027s some hidden meaning?\"\n \"There\u0027s always a hidden meaning. You added it in after you met me, didn\u0027t you?\"\n \"Yeah...I mean, it relates to the book obviously...to O\u0027Neill\u0027s revelation at the end. But I guess it relates to us too.\" His eyes drifted away, lost in the vista around us. \"I don\u0027t know. We\u0027ve had to deal with so many complications. We\u0027re still dealing with them. And what can we do? Nothing-well, unless we take your side\u0027s point of view and make deals with the devil. But why? Why can\u0027t we make deals with God?\"\n \"People do all the time. \u0027God, if you do this for me, I promise to be good.\u0027 Stuff like that.\"\n \"Yeah, but I don\u0027t see any contracts like you guys have. No hard evidence that it works.\" If I wasn\u0027t mistaken, there was a little bitterness in his voice. \"How come we can only get the things we want by being bad? Why can\u0027t we get them by being good?\"\n \"I\u0027ll ask Carter the next time I see him,\" I said dryly. \"But I have a feeling he\u0027d say goodness is its own reward.\"\n We\u0027d picked over the tapenade by now but hardly touched the wine. His claims aside, I wasn\u0027t sure Seth had even sipped his. He turned back toward me.\n \"You and I aren\u0027t being very good, are we?\" he asked. That was an understatement.\n \"You and I are the victims of unfortunate timing.\" I paused. \"And a lot of other unfortunate things.\"\n \"Would have been a lot simpler if this stasis thing had happened when we were dating. Or if we\u0027d just given in then.\"\n \"No,\" I said. \"No way. I don\u0027t care if this is a mess. It\u0027s worth it that I didn\u0027t end up hurting you.\" You spared him physical pain , a nasty voice inside me taunted. But what about Maddie? Pain isn\u0027t always physical, you of all people know that. What about the heartache you\u0027ve caused her? I ignored the voice.\n \"I don\u0027t care,\" said Seth. \"I would have done it. I would have sold my soul for you. You and me...I told you. Something\u0027s always going to keep us near each other...even if we aren\u0027t together.\"\n I rose from my chair and sat on his lap, wrapping my arms around him and wondering how it was possible that my heart was both swelling and breaking at the same time. I leaned my head against his shoulder.\n \"I love you,\" I said softly. \"And I forgive you.\" Something weird about those words made me shiver, as though I\u0027d never said them to anyone. \"And I understand now why you did what you did.\" I didn\u0027t elaborate on the \"what.\" I didn\u0027t need to.\n Seth kissed my cheek. \"Do you ever feel like...we\u0027re reliving this moment over and over?\"\n I thought about our troubled past. \"If we are, I don\u0027t want to worry about it. Not right now.\"\n I think he was going to say more, possibly even correct me, but I didn\u0027t give him a chance. I kissed him, and like every other time, it was sweet and powerful and the most right thing in the world. We wrapped ourselves together, and somehow, despite the cold weather, we got enough clothes off and made love with the wind whipping our hair and the stars shining down on us. And like that first time, I still had that sense that we weren\u0027t close enough. Even when our bodies joined and he moved in me, it still felt like I could never, ever be close enough to him. Maybe it was this mystical connection he kept talking about. Or maybe it was just a metaphor for our lot in life.\n We sat together for a long time afterward, draped in blankets and saying little. I wanted to stay there all night. Forever, even. In this affair, it was the one thing we hadn\u0027t done: spend the night together after sex. We always had to part and go on to the rest of our lives.\n He finally dropped me off at my car, and we kissed for a long time before I could finally extricate myself. Seth ran his hand along my cheek and hair, reluctant to let me go. I shared the sentiment.\n \"What will you do now?\" he asked.\n \"I don\u0027t know. One more search tomorrow, I guess. If there\u0027s even time. I expect Ephraim to name somebody any minute now.\"\n Seth nodded, eyes dark and thoughtful. \"Well, if you need company again...\"\n I smiled, unsure if that was a smart idea or not, but it wasn\u0027t a decision I wanted to make tonight. I didn\u0027t know if I wanted the balcony to be our last moment together in this fling or if I wanted to cling to another few precious seconds, even on the beach.\n \"I\u0027ll let you know,\" I promised. I kissed him one last time and then left to find my own car. I had just unlocked it when a voice spoke to me out of the darkness.\n \"Can you give me a lift?\"\n I sighed. I really didn\u0027t like the way everyone could sneak up on me lately. Of course, with Carter\u0027s sick sense of humor, I wasn\u0027t entirely shocked. He\u0027d lurked while hiding his aura plenty of times in the past because he liked the element of surprise. Still. I didn\u0027t even have a fighting chance now.\n I opened my door. \"Sorry. I don\u0027t pick up hitchhikers.\"\n Undeterred, he slid into the passenger seat and put on his seat belt. \"Did you have a good evening, madam?\" He spoke in an old-fashioned, genteel sort of way.\n \"Don\u0027t take that tone with me.\"\n \"What tone? I was being polite.\"\n \"You know exactly what I\u0027ve been doing, so don\u0027t act like you\u0027re making pleasant conversation.\"\n \"Why are they mutually exclusive?\"\n I refused to look at him. \"I don\u0027t want to be judged.\"\n \"Am I judging you? Sounds more like you\u0027re judging yourself, which really, is the way it should be. The best jury of your peers that you\u0027ll ever find is...well, you. Only you know what you\u0027re capable of and what you want to be.\"\n \"Did you find me just to delve into the philosophy of my morals?\" I grumbled.\n \"Nah,\" he said. \"Whenever I find you, I just sort of go with this free-form thing and see where the mood takes me.\"\n \"Maybe the mood could take you to Jerome.\"\n \"That\u0027s your quest, not mine. Any luck?\"\n Again, I faced that dilemma. Who could I tell what? Grace, Roman...so many players on the board now and no clear opponent. \"Some,\" I said at last.\n \"Oh-ho,\" he laughed. \"You could be an angel with an answer like that.\"\n \"Well, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s going to be enough to find Jerome, not unless a miracle happens.\" The drive was short. I pulled up outside my building, getting a lucky front spot.\n Carter turned and winked at me. \"Well, you know my take on those. Thanks for the lift.\"\n \"Wait,\" I said, realizing he was about to teleport away. \"I have a question.\"\n He arched an eyebrow. \"Oh?\"\n \"How come when mortals want things, their only option is to make a deal with Hell and sell their soul? Why can\u0027t they make deals with God in exchange for good behavior?\"\n It was another of those rare moments when I\u0027d surprised Carter. I waited for the glib answer I\u0027d mentioned to Seth, something along the lines of goodness being its own reward. The angel considered for several seconds.\n \"Humans make those deals all the time,\" he said finally. \"They just don\u0027t make them with God.\"\n \"Then who are they making them with?\" I exclaimed.\n \"Themselves.\" He vanished.\n \"Fucking angels,\" I muttered.\n I arrived in my apartment only minutes before Dante showed up. \"Oh, I\u0027m in luck,\" he said, seeing me on the couch with Aubrey. \"You seem to always be busy lately.\"\n I felt a small pang of guilt at what I\u0027d done tonight. A lie was still a lie, no matter who you were lying to.\n \"I\u0027m saving Seattle,\" I explained, making room for him beside me.\n He sat down, clean-shaven for a change and looking good in his usual jeans, thermal shirt, watch, and boots. His insecurity was driving him to buy me gifts lately, but I realized I\u0027d need to step it up and get him some wardrobe variety once all this madness ended.\n \"And how\u0027s that going exactly?\"\n Everyone kept asking me that. Seth. Carter. Dante. And my answer was lame each time. \"Not so great, actually. I think tomorrow\u0027ll be the day it all resolves, and Jerome\u0027s going to be lost forever. Even if he\u0027s not, it\u0027ll be too late for him to get his old position back. His best-case scenario\u0027ll be someone\u0027s lieutenant in northern Michigan.\"\n Dante put his arm around me and his feet on my coffee table. \"Well, succubus, don\u0027t take this wrong way, but I\u0027ll be glad when this is over, new archdemon or no. I\u0027m tired of you being stressed all the time, and I\u0027m tired of not getting any face time with you.\" He toyed with the strands of my hair. \"I\u0027m also kind of tired of how frizzy this is. Isn\u0027t there some product you can use?\"\n \"Hey,\" I said. \"Not funny. What happened to internal beauty?\"\n He seemed undaunted. \"You\u0027ve got plenty of that. I just want the whole package. Besides, the look on your face was great when I said that.\"\n His hand slipped from around my waist to trace patterns between my hip and thigh. It wasn\u0027t overtly sexual but I had a feeling that between that and his good mood-which I was happy for, don\u0027t get me wrong-there was an amorous advance in my future.\n \"Will you read my cards?\" I asked abruptly.\n He gave me a shocked look. \"Tarot cards?\"\n \"Yeah.\"\n \"You know that\u0027s all bullshit.\"\n \"It is when you bend the truth for your clients. Please? Just do a quick one.\"\n \"Fine. I\u0027ll give you a card-of-the-day one. All the mysteries of the universe in one card.\" I could hear the eye roll in his voice as he got up to get his cards out of his satchel. He usually kept them on him in the event of an impromptu client opportunity.\n \"Don\u0027t lie to me,\" I warned. \"I know more than your clients.\"\n \"Wouldn\u0027t dream of it,\" he said, deftly shuffling the cards. I\u0027d seen him scam clients plenty of times, telling them what they wanted to hear. Seeing as I didn\u0027t know what I wanted, I supposed that excluded me from that category. After the cards were thoroughly randomized, he had me cut them, and then he neatly restacked them. \"Draw.\"\n I took the first card off the top and flipped it over. \"Fuck.\"\n The Five of Cups. Spilled chalices. Lost hopes and dreams. Dante affirmed as much.\n \"Disappointment\u0027s ahead, the loss of something you had. It can be a failure or inability to resolve a recurring problem. Pretty typical reading for you.\"\n \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\"\n \"Doom and gloom always surround you. I didn\u0027t make up that palm reading for you.\" That had been even worse than this. \"It\u0027s probably just verifying that Jerome\u0027s gone for good-if you even want to believe in this. And, hey, look.\" He tapped the card. \"One cup stayed upright. Not all hope is lost.\"\n I wondered about that as I thought about losing Seth and the man in the dream. I wondered also if Roman was right, if it was true that I wouldn\u0027t know what to do if I ever was actually happy.\n As I suspected, Dante did make sexual moves on me, but I demurred as I had all week. I knew it didn\u0027t matter at this point. My cups had emptied, and the ride with Seth was over. Yet, our time on the balcony had been so sweet and so powerful that once again, I couldn\u0027t be with someone else after an encounter like that. Soon enough my sex life with Dante would return to normal-but not tonight. He didn\u0027t seem angry at being turned down, so much as hurt. I felt a little bad about that but realized I\u0027d rather feel guilty about betraying him than Seth.\n Dante was up and gone before me the next morning, but Roman was sitting in my living room eating cereal and generally making himself at home. He had to know I was standing there, but he kept his eyes on the morning news. When he finished the cereal, he clicked for Aubrey and set the bowl down for her.\n \"Hey,\" I said, scooping it up. \"Milk\u0027s bad for cats.\"\n \"You need to let her live a little,\" he protested, still watching the news. \"So what\u0027s the plan today?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m still in stasis, so I guess that gives us time. Want to throw a dart at the map and go somewhere?\" I gestured to the atlas of the Pacific Northwest lying on my coffee table.\n \"Might be the most productive method we\u0027ve tried,\" he mused.\n He had that light tone he often used, but I could hear the disappointment too. It was still a mystery to me as to why he\u0027d be so into helping find Jerome. It was a mystery best solved with coffee, I decided, and while the pot brewed, I rummaged for my own breakfast. I unearthed Pop-Tarts and again wondered about weight gain.\n \"Um, Georgina...\"\n \"If you\u0027re asking if you can feed her anything else, the answer is no.\"\n \"You need to come see this.\" His voice was deadly earnest. The hair on the back of my neck stood up, and I hurried back into the living room. Roman pointed at the TV.\n \"You have got to be kidding me,\" I groaned.\n The Army of Darkness had struck again. We were watching a Seattle station, but apparently, this north-of-the-border escapade had been deemed newsworthy. The prank had actually taken place over in Victoria, a city on an island just west of Vancouver but still in British Columbia. There were some very famous and very beautiful gardens there, and the Army had apparently broken in at night and done their best to clip a pentagram into a huge expanse of bushes. They\u0027d enhanced it with spray paint.\n \"Jesus Christ,\" I muttered. The pentagram job was bad, but the group had been savvy enough to get out of there without being caught. One shot of a courtyard there showed where they\u0027d spray-painted: ALL HAIL THE ANGEL OF DARKNESS .\n \"Glad to see they haven\u0027t lost their touch,\" Roman said wryly.\n I sank down onto the couch beside him, my mind spinning. Why? Why now? I\u0027d toyed with the theory that the Army\u0027s activities had been an absurdly elaborate distraction to take everyone\u0027s attention away from Seattle. By that reasoning, their shenanigans should have stopped once Jerome was summoned. Yet here they were again. Had they acted on their own, just for the fun of it? Had Blake discovered a spray-paint sale? Or had Grace directed them again-and if so, why?\n Most of their other activities had lined up with some other significant part of the seal\u0027s creation or Jerome\u0027s summoning. Without wasting another moment, I picked up my cell and called Cedric. I actually got through to him rather than Kristin.\n \"What?\" he demanded when he answered.\n \"This is Georgina. I just saw the news.\"\n \"Look, I do not have the time for you. In fact, you\u0027re the last person I want to talk to right now, seeing as how none of this would have happened if you\u0027d done your job in the first place.\"\n \"Yeah, yeah, I know, but listen...was anything important going on today?\"\n His voice was incredulous. \"What, you mean aside from those idiots embarrassing me again ?\"\n \"No, I mean...any events or, I don\u0027t know...just anything important, um, demonically...\"\n \"Well, if you consider my evaluation with Ephraim important, then yes.\" The sarcasm dripped through the phone.\n I froze. \"Thank you. That\u0027s all I needed to know.\"\n He actually seemed surprised by that. \"Really?\"\n \"Yeah, no, wait-when I talked to Kristin the other day, she said that you came to Seattle the day Jerome was summoned, but then Ephraim said when you got here, he was already gone. Is that true?\"\n \"Yes, of course. Do you doubt him?\"\n \"No, no...just making sure I heard right. And you were in Seattle for a while?\"\n \"Yeah, was with Grace and Mei dealing with the aftermath. Look, if you want to track my activities, wait until Kristin\u0027s back in the office.\" He sighed in frustration. \"Fuck. I wish she was here now.\"\n I hesitated, then figured I couldn\u0027t make things worse. \"Hey, just some friendly advice...but the next time you\u0027re looking at Match. com or asking out succubi, why don\u0027t you look a little closer to home?\"\n \"What the hell are you talking about?\"\n \"Kristin. If you\u0027re looking for someone who \u0027gets\u0027 you, you\u0027ve already got her. See you later.\" I hung up before I could hear his response. Roman gave me a bemused look.\n \"Are you matchmaking in the middle of this crisis?\"\n \"Just doing a good deed.\" I tossed my cell phone from hand to hand, thinking. \"Okay, so. The Army did a prank today-while Ephraim was interviewing Cedric. Not good for Cedric.\"\n \"Which is going to ruin his candidacy for Seattle.\"\n \"Likely, even though he claims he doesn\u0027t want it. Still, it makes sense that Grace would have them do it today... if she had them do it and they didn\u0027t act randomly...\"\n He shrugged. \"Makes sense, but what\u0027s it matter? You already know she\u0027s got a role in this. All this does is clear him.\"\n I frowned. I had the same sense I had the other day while analyzing the cult\u0027s activities, like I was so close but couldn\u0027t grasp all the threads. Against my better judgment, I dialed Evan. He flipped out when he realized it was me.\n \"Georgina! We\u0027ve been wondering what happened to you. Man, you will not believe what we did today, it was this-\"\n \"I already know,\" I interrupted. \"It was on the news down here.\"\n \"What? Holy shit. Hey! You guys!\" I pulled the phone away as he yelled at whoever was with him. \"We made the Seattle news!\" A moment later he returned to me. \"Wow, that\u0027s awesome. International recognition!\"\n \"Look, Evan. I need to know something. Did the Angel actually tell you to do this? And when I say that, I mean, did she actually appear in one of those visions or did you presume she wanted this?\"\n \"She was here. Told us to leave our mark at Butchart Gardens, so the world would know her glory. Cool too, since you know, it\u0027s a powerful place and all. No wonder it\u0027s having such far-reaching effects.\"\n \"Powerful place...\" My fist closed around all the threads. \"Evan, listen to me. Are you familiar with other places of power around you?\" I\u0027d always dismissed this group\u0027s arcane knowledge, never considering they might know a few things about the unseen world.\n \"Of course.\"\n Roman\u0027s eyes were fixed on me so hard, I thought they\u0027d shoot lasers right through me. He could tell I was on to something. I took a deep breath. \"Do you know of any place up there that\u0027s by a beach-on the ocean-that has white rocks or gravel or sand or anything like that? That\u0027s infused with power?\"\n \"White rocks?\" he asked. There was a few second\u0027s silence. \"Well...there\u0027s White Rock.\"\n \"What?\"\n \"It\u0027s this town that has, well, a giant white rock. Some kind of glacial thing, but the Indians thought it came from the gods or something. Always been a holy place.\"\n \"White Rock,\" I repeated flatly.\n \"Yup.\"\n No, no. It could not be that obvious. Balancing the phone with one hand, I opened the atlas with the other and flipped to the section on British Columbia. There it was, on the coast, just barely north of the American border.\n White Rock.\n \"Son of a bitch,\" I said. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-heat-georgina-kincaid-4/page-23.html","bookId":2057,"book":{"id":2057,"title":"Succubus Heat (Georgina Kincaid #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Georgina Kincaid Book 4: Succubus Heat \n Which should be a good thing.
