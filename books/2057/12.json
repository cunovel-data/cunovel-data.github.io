{"id":110306,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"Searching the Internet didn\u0027t turn up much, just as I\u0027d feared. Still, I took some satisfaction in at least doing something. It kept my mind off my possibly impending death. It kept my mind off demons descending on Seattle. Most importantly, it kept my mind off Seth. Because if I thought about him, I was going to think about touching him and kissing him and...well, a lot of other things. My feelings for him were starting to consume me, almost to the extent that my other problems seemed trivial. So, I lost myself in Google searches, hoping for any scrap of information about demon summoning. As expected, most of my hits sent me to sites on role-playing games and Dr. Faustus. Still, I felt better than if I\u0027d just sat around. Driving to the meeting at the Cellar was about as agonizing as walking to the bookstore had been. I took slow back roads, unwilling to face the congestion and speed of the freeways. The Cellar was a pub a lot of Seattle immortals liked to frequent. Whoever had organized this event had apparently reserved the restaurant\u0027s back room, which was normally used for banquets and wedding receptions. I didn\u0027t have to sense demonic magic to know they\u0027d sealed off the space from prying ears. The dimly lit room was crowded when I entered. I recognized some of the local lesser immortals, but most were demons I didn\u0027t know. Few sat at the long table, which was covered with appetizer plates and bottles of wine. Most people stood around the edges, deep in conversation, or had pulled chairs up in tight, furtive clusters. Grace and Mei were both working the room, looking as businesslike and efficient as ever-albeit edged in an uncharacteristically frazzled air. For the first time ever, they were dressed differently, and I wondered if stress had prevented them from coordinating their wardrobes. Mei wore a red skirt and blazer with a necklace made of tiny alternating gold and silver rings. Grace wore a linen pantsuit with a chunky stone choker with a crescent moon pendant. Peter, Cody, and Hugh stood in the corner and waved me over. \"Hey,\" I said, \"what\u0027s going on?\" \"Not much,\" said Hugh. \"This seems to be more of a meet and greet. Not a lot of organization.\" We fell silent, all of us watching the interactions. In the opposite corner, I saw Cedric gesturing dramatically as he spoke. His face was dark and intent, and Kristin stood nearby with a clipboard and rapt expression, taking notes. Not far away, Nanette stood with her lovely, unreadable face while listening to another demoness talk. \"So, you must be Jerome\u0027s staff.\" The four of us turned. None of us had noticed the demon approaching, thanks to losing our ability to sense immortal signatures. This whole experience, I decided, really was like being bereft of sight or smell. This particular demon was no one I knew. He had a big toothy smile and skin that looked like it had had a tanning job go bad. His spiky white-blond hair wasn\u0027t doing him any favors either. He extended a hand. \"I\u0027m Tom. Pleasure to meet you all.\" We each shook his hand in return, introducing ourselves. He held our hands with great vigor, like a politician on the campaign trail. If we\u0027d had a baby, I had no doubts he would have kissed it. \"I imagine this must be pretty strange for you,\" he commented. \"But I want you to know that we\u0027re all here for you. There\u0027s nothing to worry about-things\u0027ll be back to normal before long.\" \"Thank you,\" I said politely, giving as good a succubus smile as I could in a non-succubus state. Snark around a demon was never a good idea. Snark when you didn\u0027t have your normal powers? Horrible idea. \"We\u0027re just anxious to get Jerome back.\" His smile faltered a little but quickly resumed. \"Yes, yes. Of course. We\u0027re all doing everything we can. But, of course, you know there\u0027s a chance Jerome might not be found...\" \"So we\u0027ve heard,\" said Hugh, speaking as politely as I had. Tom nodded. \"But don\u0027t worry. In the tragic event that happens, we\u0027ll make sure you guys are taken care of. You can rest assured that Seattle\u0027s next archdemon will rule with control and competence, making sure you\u0027re able to perform your duties in an efficient and effective manner.\" I had a feeling he was on the verge of telling us how, if elected, he\u0027d cut taxes and increase jobs, but we were interrupted by a high-pitched voice. \"Georg- gee -na!\" A seven-foot woman was heading toward us. She had ebony-black skin that looked horrible with her orange hair. The combination made Tom\u0027s features look supermodel gorgeous. Gold eye shadow shot all the way to her eyebrows, its glitter rivaled only by the multicolored sequins of her dress. A black feather boa flared around her as she walked. Several demons in the room froze and watched her, which was remarkable. Demons are not easily fazed. \"Who\u0027s that?\" asked Cody. Just like with Tom, Cody could sense neither the identity nor even the type of this immortal. But I needed no such clues. \"Tawny,\" Peter and I said in unison. \"How do you guys know?\" asked Cody. \"The clothes,\" said Peter. \"The whine,\" I said. Tom was standing there, mouth half-open. A moment later, he recovered himself. \"Well, it was nice meeting you all. I hope you\u0027ll come talk to me if you have any questions or concerns. I\u0027m very eager to get to know you all better.\" He scurried off just as Tawny reached us. We stared. \"What the hell happened to you?\" exclaimed Hugh. Tawny pouted. \"Well, there was this really nice guy that I wanted. Really pure and-\" \"Tawny,\" I interrupted. \"I\u0027ve told you a hundred times. Stop worrying about the good ones.\" She shook her head. \"No, no. He was into me. Well, he was into this.\" She gestured to her body. \"I figured out that he had these weird fantasies his wife didn\u0027t know about. So, I put on this shape, and we did it . And the energy...it was amazing.\" I couldn\u0027t hide my astonishment. Tawny had managed to score a decent guy. She\u0027d used a strategy that, while basic, was also highly effective: exploiting secret desires. It could shake the unshakable soul. \"Wow,\" I said at last. \"That\u0027s great. I...well, I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m saying this, but I\u0027m proud of you.\" She sighed. \"But I didn\u0027t get to enjoy the rush. Like, ten minutes after it happened, it went away. Everything went away. I started feeling sick and-\" \"Yeah, we know the rest,\" said Cody, not unkindly. \"And I was wearing this body, and now...now I\u0027m stuck with it.\" Under normal conditions, this would have provided hours of hilarity. For now, I actually felt bad for her. \"Well, hang in there. They say this won\u0027t last for long.\" Tawny nodded unhappily. \"Yeah. Here\u0027s hoping.\" Then, unexpectedly, she brightened a little. \"Oh, but hey, you were totally right about the blow-job thing.\" Hugh\u0027s head whipped around to stare at me. \"What?\" Before I could say anything, Mei thankfully shouted for everyone\u0027s attention. And when I say shouted, I mean it. She used her power to amplify her voice, so it rang painfully through the whole room, making a lot of us wince and cover our ears. Several people backed away, giving us a clear view of her and Grace. \"We want to thank everyone for coming,\" Mei said, returning to her usual flat, emotionless voice. \"And we appreciate everyone\u0027s help as we try to keep things running around here. Mei and I have everything under control right now, but the concern everyone\u0027s shown is certainly...admirable.\" There was the slightest wry note in Grace\u0027s voice as she glanced around at the assembled demons. Many of them straightened up and smiled, acting as though they truly were here out of concern for us. \"We know you\u0027re as anxious to find Jerome as we are,\" said Mei. \"And we\u0027ll be doing everything we can to locate him.\" Some of those smiles tightened a little, and the crowd shifted uncomfortably. As I\u0027d told Seth, not everyone was so eager for Jerome\u0027s return. \"Yes, of course,\" a booming voice said. Tom had joined Grace and Mei in the spotlight. \"Jerome is our top priority, of course. And if-I mean, when-he\u0027s found, I\u0027m sure Management will be most eager to talk to him about how this happened in the first place. No doubt he will need a little...rehabilitation, and should he be unable to fulfill his duties, I for one am ready right now to step up and run infernal affairs in Seattle.\" \"Well, Tom.\" A dark-haired demoness from across the room straightened up from where she leaned against the wall. \"If memory serves, your leadership in Tuscaloosa didn\u0027t end so well.\" Tom glowered. \"That was not my fault.\" So it began. The meeting slowly degenerated into chaos and mostly became about each demon talking about why he or she was the best choice-and why all of the others were completely unfit. It was like a year of presidential campaigning condensed into an hour. \"Look at Grace and Mei,\" noted Hugh. \"They look like they want to smite this entire room.\" \"Well,\" I said. \"That\u0027s the thing. All these demons are talking about keeping hellish affairs in order here, but those two are the ones who are actually doing it right now.\" \"Hell should just let them take over if Jerome doesn\u0027t come back,\" said Cody. I gave him a sharp look. \"Er, I mean, not that there\u0027s any question of that. He\u0027ll be back.\" \"Let\u0027s hope so,\" a new voice said. Cedric had strolled over and joined our circle, Kristin in tow. \"Whatever,\" I said, unable to hide a smile. \"You can\u0027t tell me you want him back. This is your perfect chance to create your great Northwest empire.\" He shook his head. \"No, believe me, I want nothing to do with any of this. Compared to some of these losers, Jerome suddenly seems like an ideal neighbor.\" It was very much like what Isabelle had said. \"I don\u0027t suppose,\" Cedric added, \"that you\u0027re going to be coming back up to Vancouver?\" I hesitated. Was I? Who did I answer to now? Did Jerome\u0027s orders still stand? \"I...I don\u0027t know,\" I admitted. \"I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m supposed to. If I should leave.\" \"Well,\" he said. \"It wasn\u0027t like you were doing that great a job.\" \"I was too! I\u0027d gotten them to back down before their so-called angel spoke to them. She told them not to trust me.\" I frowned, wondering if I should go on. I didn\u0027t know who to trust without Jerome around, and as Hugh had said, Cedric was still a very likely candidate for Jerome\u0027s summoning, in spite of my gut instinct. \"And you know...I think I have an idea about who did this and who that angel is...\" Cedric groaned. \"Will you give up on Isabelle already?\" I shook my head and lowered my voice. \"I don\u0027t think it was her. I think it was Nanette.\" The incredulous look on his face didn\u0027t change. \"That\u0027s as ridiculous as Isabelle. You were there. You saw Nanette come to me because she was simply worried about managing her own territory.\" \"Funny, she had a similar meeting with Jerome not long after that.\" Cedric\u0027s face kept that cool, skeptical expression that demons excelled it. But, I was pretty sure I could see a spark of interest in his blue-gray eyes. \"That doesn\u0027t mean anything.\" Another gut feeling told me he was lying. He started to turn, but then Cody spoke, voice hesitant. \"Excuse me...do you know...are we mortal?\" Cedric hesitated a moment and then laughed. When none of us said anything, he glanced between all our faces. \"Oh. You\u0027re serious?\" \"Why is that such a crazy question?\" I demanded. \"We\u0027ve lost everything else that makes us immortal.\" \"You\u0027ve lost it to keep you out of trouble,\" said Cedric. \"Nobody wants you guys running around unsupervised with your normal abilities. So when you lose an archdemon, you get cut off. But you\u0027re still immortal. You think you can get out of your contract with something as easy as death?\" \"So we could get hit by a car and still be okay?\" asked Cody. \"Of course. Sure, it\u0027d take awhile to recover. You\u0027d heal like a human, but you\u0027d eventually heal.\" \"What if we got decapitated?\" asked Peter. \"Yeah,\" agreed Cody. \"Like in Highlander ?\" Cedric rolled his eyes. \"Don\u0027t get decapitated, and we\u0027ll never have to find out.\" He focused on me. \"Look, stay here for a while. Something tells me that the Angel of Darkness isn\u0027t going to be making any appearances anytime soon. I suspect the distraction is over.\" \"I agree. Thanks.\" He gave me a curt nod and started to turn. Then, he glanced back at Tawny and did a double-take. \"What\u0027s your name?\" \"Tawny,\" she replied. He eyed her from head to foot and then turned to Kristin. \"Get her number and set up a date.\" I saw a spark of something in Kristin\u0027s eyes, and it took me a moment to identify it. Jealousy. Reflecting back on the way she doted on his affairs, I shouldn\u0027t have been surprised that she had a crush on him. She flipped through a few pages in her clipboard, her lips tight and disapproving. \"You\u0027ve got a lot of appointments this week. You hate it when you\u0027ve got back-to-back events.\" She spoke levelly, but I could tell that while part of her warning came from true concern, another part of her welcomed the chance to throw a kink into his dating life. Cedric didn\u0027t appear to notice. He waved a dismissive hand. \"Cancel something unimportant. You\u0027ll know what to do.\" He wandered off while Kristin took down Tawny\u0027s number. \"We\u0027ll be in touch,\" Kristin said flatly. \"Huh,\" said Tawny, once Kristin was gone. \"He\u0027s kind of cute. Maybe this body isn\u0027t so bad after all.\" I exchanged glances with Hugh and Peter. They looked a lot like I felt: weary and frustrated, with the secret suspicion that this was all almost funny. \"Well,\" I said, watching Tawny smile with delight. \"At least someone\u0027s happy with all this.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-heat-georgina-kincaid-4/page-12.html","bookId":2057,"book":{"id":2057,"title":"Succubus Heat (Georgina Kincaid #4)","description":"Storyline: Georgina Kincaid Book 4: Succubus Heat Which should be a good thing.
