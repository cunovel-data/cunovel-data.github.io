{"id":1589,"title":"His Lordship Possessed","description":"Storyline: Lady Diana Walsh calls on Kit to investigate and dispel the curse she believes responsible for carving hateful words into her own flesh as she sleeps. While Kit doesn’t believe in magic herself, she can’t refuse to help a woman subjected nightly to such vicious assaults. As Kit investigates the Walsh family, she becomes convinced that the attacks on Diana are part of a larger, more ominous plot—one that may involve the lady’s obnoxious husband. Sleuthing in the city of Rumsen is difficult enough, but soon Kit must also skirt the unwanted attentions of nefarious deathmage Lucien Dredmore and the unwelcome scrutiny of police Chief Inspector Thomas Doyle. Unwilling to surrender to either man’s passion for her, Kit struggles to remain independent as she draws closer to the heart of the mystery. Yet as she learns the truth behind her ladyship’s curse, Kit also uncovers a massive conspiracy that promises to ruin her life—and turn Rumsen into a supernatural battleground from which no one will escape alive.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/his-lordship-possessed.jpg","author":"Lynn Viehl","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":29,"category":{"id":7,"name":"Science Fiction","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
