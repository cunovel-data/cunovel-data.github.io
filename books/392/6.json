{"id":36394,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 6 Preemptive Absolution","content":"\"Now, Fra Pavel,\" said the Inquirer of the Consistorial Court of Discipline, \"I want you to recall exactly, if you can, the words you heard the witch speak on the ship.\" The twelve members of the Court looked through the dim afternoon light at the cleric on the stand, their last witness. He was a scholarly-looking priest whose daemon had the form of a frog. The Court had been hearing evidence in this case for eight days already, in the ancient high-towered College of St. Jerome. \"I cannot call the witch\u0027s words exactly to mind,\" said Fra Pavel wearily. \"I had not seen torture before, as I said to the Court yesterday, and I found it made me feel faint and sick. So exactly what she said I cannot tell you, but I remember the meaning of it. The witch said that the child Lyra had been recognized by the clans of the north as the subject of a prophecy they had long known. She was to have the power to make a fateful choice, on which the future of all the worlds depended. And furthermore, there was a name that would bring to mind a parallel case, and which would make the Church hate and fear her.\" \"And did the witch reveal that name?\" \"No. Before she could utter it, another witch, who had been present under a spell of invisibility, managed to kill her and escape.\" \"So on that occasion, the woman Coulter will not have heard the name?\" \"That is so.\" \"And shortly afterwards Mrs. Coulter left?\" \"Indeed.\" \"What did you discover after that?\" \"I learned that the child had gone into that other world opened by Lord Asriel, and that there she has acquired the help of a boy who owns, or has got the use of, a knife of extraordinary powers,\" said Fra Pavel. Then he cleared his throat nervously and went on: \"I may speak entirely freely in this court?\" \"With perfect freedom, Fra Pavel,\" came the harsh, clear tones of the President. \"You will not be punished for telling us what you in turn have been told. Please continue.\" Reassured, the cleric went on: \"The knife in the possession of this boy is able to make openings between worlds. Furthermore, it has a power greater than that, please, once again, I am afraid of what I am saying ... It is capable of killing the most high angels, and what is higher than them. There is nothing this knife cannot destroy.\" He was sweating and trembling, and his frog daemon fell from the edge of the witness stand to the floor in her agitation. Fra Pavel gasped in pain and scooped her up swiftly, letting her sip at the water in the glass in front of him. \"And did you ask further about the girl?\" said the Inquirer. \"Did you discover this name the witch spoke of?\" \"Yes, I did. Once again I crave the assurance of the court that...” \"You have it,\" snapped the President. \"Don\u0027t be afraid. You are not a heretic. Report what you have learned, and waste no more time.\" \"I beg your pardon, truly. The child, then, is in the position of Eve, the wife of Adam, the mother of us all, and the cause of all sin.\" The stenographers taking down every word were nuns of the order of St. Philomel, sworn to silence; but at Fra Pavel\u0027s words there came a smothered gasp from one of them, and there was a flurry of hands as they crossed themselves. Fra Pavel twitched, and went on: \"Please, remember, the alethiometer does not forecast; it says, \u0027If certain things come about, then the consequences will be...,\u0027 and so on. And it says that if it comes about that the child is tempted, as Eve was, then she is likely to fall. On the outcome will depend... everything. And if this temptation does take place, and if the child gives in, then Dust and sin will triumph.\" There was silence in the courtroom. The pale sunlight that filtered in through the great leaded windows held in its slanted beams a million golden motes, but these were dust, not Dust, though more than one of the members of the Court had seen in them an image of that other invisible Dust that settled over every human being, no matter how dutifully they kept the laws. \"Finally, Fra Pavel,\" said the Inquirer, \"tell us what you know of the child\u0027s present whereabouts.\" \"She is in the hands of Mrs. Coulter,\" said Fra Pavel. \"And they are in the Himalaya. So far, that is all I have been able to tell. I shall go at once and ask for a more precise location, and as soon as I have it, I shall tell the Court; but...\" He stopped, shrinking in fear, and held the glass to his lips with a trembling hand. \"Yes, Fra Pavel?\" said Father MacPhail. \"Hold nothing back.\" \"I believe, Father President, that the Society of the Work of the Holy Spirit knows more about this than I do.\" Fra Pavel\u0027s voice was so faint it was almost a whisper. \"Is that so?\" said the President, his eyes seeming to radiate his passion as they glared. Fra Pavel\u0027s daemon uttered a little frog whimper. The cleric knew about the rivalry between the different branches of the Magisterium, and knew that to get caught in the cross fire between them would be very dangerous; but to hold back what he knew would be more dangerous still. \"I believe,\" he went on, trembling, \"that they are much closer to finding out exactly where the child is. They have other sources of knowledge forbidden to me.\" \"Quite so,\" said the Inquirer. \"And did the alethiometer tell you about this?\" \"Yes, it did.\" \"Very well. Fra Pavel, you would do well to continue that line of investigation. Whatever you need in the way of clerical or secretarial help is yours to command. Please stand down.\" Fra Pavel bowed, and with his frog daemon on his shoulder, he gathered his notes and left the courtroom. The nuns flexed their fingers. Father MacPhail tapped a pencil on the oak bench in front of him. \"Sister Agnes, Sister Monica,\" he said, \"you may leave us now. Please have the transcription on my desk by the end of the day.\" The two nuns bowed their heads and left. \"Gentlemen,\" said the President, for that was the mode of address in the Consistorial Court, \"let\u0027s adjourn.\" The twelve members, from the oldest (Father Makepwe, ancient and rheumy-eyed) to the youngest (Father Gomez, pale and trembling with zealotry), gathered their notes and followed the President through to the council chamber, where they could face one another across a table and talk in the utmost privacy. The current President of the Consistorial Court was a Scot called Hugh MacPhail. He had been elected young. Presidents served for life, and he was only in his forties, so it was to be expected that Father MacPhail would mold the destiny of the Consistorial Court, and thus of the whole Church, for many years to come. He was a dark-featured man, tall and imposing, with a shock of wiry gray hair, and he would have been fat were it not for the brutal discipline he imposed on his body: he drank only water and ate only bread and fruit, and he exercised for an hour daily under the supervision of a trainer of champion athletes. As a result, he was gaunt and lined and restless. His daemon was a lizard. Once they were seated, Father MacPhail said: \"This, then, is the state of things. There seem to be several points to bear in mind. \"Firstly, Lord Asriel. A witch friendly to the Church reports that he is assembling a great army, including forces that may be angelic. His intentions, as far as the witch knows, are malevolent toward the Church, and toward the Authority himself. \"Secondly, the Oblation Board. Their actions in setting up the research program at Bolvangar, and in funding Mrs. Coulter\u0027s activities, suggest that they are hoping to replace the Consistorial Court of Discipline as the most powerful and effective arm of the Holy Church. We have been outpaced, gentlemen. They have acted ruthlessly and skillfully. We should be chastised for our laxity in letting it happen. I shall return to what we might do about it shortly. \"Thirdly, the boy in Fra Pavel\u0027s testimony, with the knife that can do these extraordinary things. Clearly we must find him and gain possession of it as soon as possible. \"Fourthly, Dust. I have taken steps to find out what the Oblation Board has discovered about it. One of the experimental theologians working at Bolvangar has been persuaded to tell us what exactly they discovered. I shall talk to him this afternoon downstairs.\" One or two of the priests shifted uncomfortably, for \"downstairs\" meant the cellars below the building: white-tiled rooms with points for anbaric current, soundproofed and well-drained. \"Whatever we do learn about Dust, though,\" the President went on, \"we must bear our purpose firmly in mind. The Oblation Board sought to understand the effects of Dust; we must destroy it altogether. Nothing less than that. If in order to destroy Dust we also have to destroy the Oblation Board, the College of Bishops, every single agency by which the Holy Church does the work of the Authority, then so be it. It may be, gentlemen, that the Holy Church itself was brought into being to perform this very task and to perish in the doing of it. But better a world with no Church and no Dust than a world where every day we have to struggle under the hideous burden of sin. Better a world purged of all that!\" Blazing-eyed, Father Gomez nodded passionately. \"And finally,\" said Father MacPhail, \"the child. Still just a child, I think. This Eve, who is going to be tempted and who, if precedent is any guide, will fall, and whose fall will involve us all in ruin. Gentlemen, of all the ways of dealing with the problem she sets us, I am going to propose the most radical, and I have confidence in your agreement. \"I propose to send a man to find her and kill her before she can be tempted.\" \"Father President,\" said Father Gomez at once, \"I have done preemptive penance every day of my adult life. I have studied, I have trained...” The President held up his hand. Preemptive penance and absolution were doctrines researched and developed by the Consistorial Court, but not known to the wider Church. They involved doing penance for a sin not yet committed, intense and fervent penance accompanied by scourging and flagellation, so as to build up, as it were, a store of credit. When the penance had reached the appropriate level for a particular sin, the penitent was granted absolution in advance, though he might never be called on to commit the sin. It was sometimes necessary to kill people, for example; and it was so much less troubling for the assassin if he could do so in a state of grace. \"I had you in mind,\" said Father MacPhail kindly. \"I have the agreement of the Court? Yes. When Father Gomez leaves, with our blessing, he will be on his own, unable to be reached or recalled. Whatever happens to anyone else, he will make his way like the arrow of God, straight to the child, and strike her down. He will be invisible; he will come in the night, like the angel that blasted the Assyrians; he will be silent. How much better for us all if there had been a Father Gomez in the Garden of Eden! We would never have left paradise.\" The young priest was nearly weeping with pride. The Court gave its blessing. And in the darkest corner of the ceiling, hidden among the dark oak beams, sat a man no larger than a hand span. His heels were armed with spurs, and he heard every word they said. In the cellars the man from Bolvangar, dressed only in a dirty white shirt and loose trousers with no belt, stood under the bare light bulb clutching the trousers with one hand and his rabbit daemon with the other. In front of him, in the only chair, sat Father MacPhail. \"Dr. Cooper,\" the President began, \"do sit down.\" There was no furniture except the chair, the wooden bunk, and a bucket. The President\u0027s voice echoed unpleasantly off, the white tiles that lined the wall and ceiling. Dr. Cooper sat on the bunk. He could not take his eyes off the gaunt and gray-haired President. He licked his dry lips and waited to see what new discomfort was coming. \"So you nearly succeeded in severing the child from her daemon?\" said Father MacPhail. Dr. Cooper said shakily, \"We considered that it would serve no purpose to wait, since the experiment was due to take place anyway, and we put the child in the experimental chamber, but then Mrs. Coulter herself intervened and took the child to her own quarters.\" The rabbit daemon opened her round eyes and gazed fearfully at the President, and then shut them again and hid her face. \"That must have been distressing,\" said Father MacPhail. \"The whole program was intensely difficult,\" said Dr. Cooper, hastening to agree. \"I am surprised you did not seek the aid of the Consistorial Court, where we have strong nerves.\" \"We, I, we understood that the program was licensed by... It was an Oblation Board matter, but we were told it had the approval of the Consistorial Court of Discipline. We would never have taken part otherwise. Never!\" \"No, of course not. And now for another matter. Did you have any idea,\" said Father MacPhail, turning to the real subject of his visit to the cellars, \"of the subject of Lord Asriel\u0027s researches? Of what might have been the source of the colossal energy he managed to release on Svalbard?\" Dr. Cooper swallowed. In the intense silence a drop of sweat fell from his chin to the concrete floor, and both men heard it distinctly. \"Well...\" he began, \"there was one of our team who observed that in the process of severance there was a release of energy. Controlling it would involve enormous forces, but just as an atomic explosion is detonated by conventional explosives, this could be done by focusing a powerful anbaric current... However, he wasn\u0027t taken seriously. I paid no attention to his ideas,\" he added earnestly, \"knowing that without authority they might well be heretical.\" \"Very wise. And that colleague now? Where is he?\" \"He was one of those who died in the attack.\" The President smiled. It was so kindly an expression that Dr. Cooper\u0027s daemon shivered and swooned against his breast. \"Courage, Dr. Cooper,\" said Father MacPhail. \"We need you to be strong and brave! There is great work to be done, a great battle to be fought. You must earn the forgiveness of the Authority by cooperating fully with us, by holding nothing back, not even wild speculation, not even gossip. Now I want you to devote all your attention to what you remember your colleague saying. Did he make any experiments? Did he leave any notes? Did he take anyone else into his confidence? What equipment was he using? Think of everything, Dr. Cooper. You\u0027ll have pen and paper and all the time you need. \"And this room is not very comfortable. We\u0027ll have you moved to somewhere more suitable. Is there anything you need in the way of furnishing, for example? Do you prefer to write at a table or a desk? Would you like a typewriting machine? Perhaps you would rather dictate to a stenographer? \"Let the guards know, and you shall have everything you need. But every moment, Dr. Cooper, I want you to think back I to your colleague and his theory. Your great task is to recall, and if necessary to rediscover, what he knew. Once you know what instruments you require, you shall have those as well. It is a great task, Dr. Cooper! You are blessed to be entrusted with it! Give thanks to the Authority.\" \"I do, Father President! I do!\" Grasping the loose waistband of his trousers, the philosopher stood up and bowed almost without realizing it, again and again, as the President of the Consistorial Court of Discipline left his cell. That evening the Chevalier Tialys, the Gallivespian spy, made his way through the lanes and alleys of Geneva to meet his colleague, the Lady Salmakia. It was a dangerous journey for both of them: dangerous for anyone or anything that challenged them, too, but certainly full of peril for the small Gallivespians. More than one prowling cat had met its death at their spurs, but only the week before, the Chevalier had nearly lost an arm to the teeth of a mangy dog; only the Lady\u0027s swift action had saved him. They met at the seventh of their appointed meeting places, among the roots of a plane tree in a shabby little square, and exchanged their news. The Lady Salmakia\u0027s contact in the Society had told her that earlier that evening they had received a friendly invitation from the President of the Consistorial Court to come and discuss matters of mutual interest. \"Quick work,\" said the Chevalier. \"A hundred to one he doesn\u0027t tell them about his assassin, though.\" He told her about the plan to kill Lyra. She was not surprised. \"It\u0027s the logical thing to do,\" she said. \"Very logical people. Tialys, do you think we shall ever see this child?\" \"I don\u0027t know, but I should like to. Go well, Salmakia. Tomorrow at the fountain.\" Unsaid behind that brief exchange was the one thing they never spoke of: the shortness of their lives compared with those of humans. Gallivespians lived to nine years or ten, rarely more, and Tialys and Salmakia were both in their eighth year. They didn\u0027t fear old age, their people died in the full strength and vigor of their prime, suddenly, and their childhoods were very brief, but compared with their lives, the life of a child like Lyra would extend as far into the future as the lives of the witches extended past Lyra\u0027s own. The Chevalier returned to the College of St. Jerome and began to compose the message he would send to Lord Roke on the lodestone resonator. But while Tialys was at the rendezvous talking to Salmakia, the President sent for Father Gomez. In his study they prayed together for an hour, and then Father MacPhail granted the young priest the preemptive absolution that would make his murder of Lyra no murder at all. Father Gomez seemed transfigured; the certainty that ran through his veins seemed to make his very eyes incandescent. They discussed practical arrangements, money, and so forth; and then the President said, \"Once you leave here, Father Gomez, you will be completely cut off, forever, from any help we can give. You can never come back; you will never hear from us. I can\u0027t offer you any better advice than this: don\u0027t look for the child. That would give you away. Instead, look for the tempter. Follow the tempter, and she will lead you to the child.\" \"She?\" said Father Gomez, shocked. \"Yes, she,\" said Father MacPhail. \"We have learned that much from the alethiometer. The world the tempter comes from is a strange one. You will see many things that will shock and startle you, Father Gomez. Don\u0027t let yourself be distracted by their oddness from the sacred task you have to do. I have faith,\" he added kindly, \"in the power of your faith. This woman is traveling, guided by the powers of evil, to a place where she may, eventually, meet the child in time to tempt her. That is, of course, if we do not succeed in removing the girl from her present location. That remains our first plan. You, Father Gomez, are our ultimate guarantee that if that falls through, the infernal powers will still not prevail.\" Father Gomez nodded. His daemon, a large and iridescent green-backed beetle, clicked her wing cases. The President opened a drawer and handed the young priest a folded packet of papers. \"Here is all we know about the woman,\" he said, \"and the world she comes from, and the place she was last seen. Read it well, my dear Luis, and go with my blessing.\" He had never used the priest\u0027s given name before. Father Gomez felt tears of joy prick his eyes as he kissed the President farewell. - you\u0027re Lyra.\" Then she realized what that meant. She felt dizzy, even in her dream; she felt a great burden settle on her shoulders. And to make it even heavier, sleep was closing in again, and Roger\u0027s face was receding into shadow. \"Well, I... I know... There\u0027s all kinds of people on our side, like Dr. Malone.. .You know there\u0027s another Oxford, Roger, just like ours. Well, she ... I found her in... She\u0027d help ... But there\u0027s only one person really who...\" It was almost impossible now to see the little boy, and her thoughts were spreading out and wandering away like sheep in a field. \"But we can trust him, Roger, I swear,\" she said with a final effort,","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/9/143.html","bookId":392,"book":{"id":392,"title":"The Amber Spyglass琥珀望远镜","description":"简介： The Amber Spyglass brings the intrigue of The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife to a heartstopping close, marking the third volume as the most powerful of the trilogy.
