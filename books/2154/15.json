Muad\u0027dib has used his Jihad and -\"\\n\\n \"He didn\u0027t use the Jihad,\" Scytale said. \"The Jihad used him. I think he would\u0027ve stopped it if he could.\"\\n\\n \"If he could? All he had to do was -\"\\n\\n \"Oh, be still!\" Scytale barked. \"You can\u0027t stop a mental epidemic. It leaps from person to person across parsecs. It\u0027s overwhelmingly contagious. It strikes at the unprotected side, in the place where we lodge the fragments of other such plagues. Who can stop such a thing? Muad\u0027dib hasn\u0027t the antidote. The thing has roots in chaos. Can orders reach there?\"\\n\\n \"Have you been infected, then?\" Edric asked. He turned slowly in the orange gas, wondering why Scytale\u0027s words carried such a tone of fear. Had the Face Dancer broken from the conspiracy? There was no way to peer into the future and examine this now. The future had become a muddy stream, clogged with prophets.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re all contaminated,\" Scytale said, and he reminded himself that Edric\u0027s intelligence had severe limits. How could this point be made that the Guildsman would understand it?\\n\\n \"But when we destroy him,\" Edric said, \"the contag -\"\\n\\n \"I should leave you in this ignorance,\" Scytale said. \"But my duties will not permit it. Besides, it\u0027s dangerous to all of us.\"\\n\\n Edric recoiled, steadied himself with a kick of one webbed foot which sent the orange gas whipping around his legs. \"You speak strangely,\" he said.\\n\\n \"This whole thing is explosive,\" Scytale said in a calmer voice. \"It\u0027s ready to shatter. When it goes, it will send bits of itself out through the centuries. Don\u0027t you see this?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve dealt with religions before,\" Edric protested. \"If this new -\"\\n\\n \"It is not just a religion!\" Scytale said, wondering what the Reverend Mother would say to this harsh education of their fellow conspirator. \"Religious government is something else. Muad\u0027dib has crowded his Qizarate in everywhere, displaced the old functions of government. But he has no permanent civil service, no interlocking embassies. He has bishoprics, islands of authority. At the center of each island is a man. Men learn how to gain and hold personal power. Men are jealous.\"\\n\\n \"When they\u0027re divided, we\u0027ll absorb them one by one,\" Edric said with a complacent smile. \"Cut off the head and the body will fall to -\"\\n\\n \"This body has two heads,\" Scytale said.\\n\\n \"The sister - who may wed.\"\\n\\n \"Who will certainly wed.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like your tone, Scytale.\"\\n\\n \"And I don\u0027t like your ignorance.\"\\n\\n \"What if she does wed? Will that shake our plans?\"\\n\\n \"It will shake the universe.\"\\n\\n \"But they\u0027re not unique. I, myself, possess powers which -\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re an infant. You toddle where they stride.\"\\n\\n \"They are not unique!\"\\n\\n \"You forget, Guildsman, that we once made a kwisatz haderach. This is a being filled by the spectacle of Time. It is a form of existence which cannot be threatened without enclosing yourself in the identical threat. Muad\u0027dib knows we would attack his Chani. We must move faster than we have. You must get to the ghola, prod him as I have instructed.\"\\n\\n \"And if I do not?\"\\n\\n \"We will feel the thunderbolt.\"\\n\\n Oh, worm of many teeth, Canst thou deny what has no cure? The flesh and breath which lure thee To the ground of all beginnings Feed on monsters twisting in a door of fire! Thou hast no robe in all thy attire To cover intoxications of divinity Or hide the burnings of desire! -Wormsong from the Dunebook\\n\\n Paul had worked up a sweat on the practice floor using crysknife and short sword against the ghola. He stood now at a window looking down into the temple plaza, tried to imagine the scene with Chani at the clinic. She\u0027d been taken ill at midmorning, the sixth week of her pregnancy. The medics were the best. They\u0027d call when they had news.\\n\\n Murky afternoon sandclouds darkened the sky over the plaza. Fremen called such weather \"dirty air.\"\\n\\n Would the medics never call? Each second struggled past, reluctant to enter his universe.\\n\\n Waiting... waiting... The Bene Gesserit sent no word from Wallach. Deliberately delaying, of course.\\n\\n Prescient vision had recorded these moments, but he shielded his awareness from the oracle, preferring the role here of a Timefish swimming not where he willed, but where the currents carried him. Destiny permitted no struggles now.\\n\\n The ghola could be heard racking weapons, examining the equipment. Paul sighed, put a hand to his own belt, deactivated his shield. The tingling passage of its field ran down against his skin.\\n\\n He\u0027d face events when Chani came, Paul told himself. Time enough then to accept the fact that what he\u0027d concealed from her had prolonged her life. Was it evil, he wondered, to prefer Chani to an heir? By what right did he make her choice for her? Foolish thoughts! Who could hesitate, given the alternatives - slave pits, torture, agonizing sorrow... and worse.\\n\\n He heard the door open, Chani\u0027s footsteps.\\n\\n Paul turned.\\n\\n Murder sat on Chani\u0027s face. The wide Fremen belt which gathered the waist of her golden robe, the water rings worn as a necklace, one hand at her hip (never far from the knife), the trenchant stare which was her first inspection of any room - everything about her stood now only as a background for violence.\\n\\n He opened his arms as she came to him, gathered her close.\\n\\n \"Someone,\" she rasped, speaking against his breast, \"has been feeding me a contraceptive for a long time... before I began the new diet. There\u0027ll be problems with this birth because of it.\"\\n\\n \"But there are remedies?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Dangerous remedies. I know the source of that poison! I\u0027ll have her blood.\"\\n\\n \"My Sihaya,\" he whispered, holding her close to calm a sudden trembling. \"You\u0027ll bear the heir we want. Isn\u0027t that enough?\"\\n\\n \"My life burns faster,\" she said, pressing against him. \"The birth now controls my life. The medics told me it goes at a terrible pace. I must eat and eat... and take more spice, as well... eat it, drink it. I\u0027ll kill her for this!\"\\n\\n Paul kissed her cheek. \"No, my Sihaya. You\u0027ll kill no one.\" And he thought: Irulan prolonged your life, beloved. For you, the time of birth is the time of death.\\n\\n He felt hidden grief drain his marrow then, empty his life into a black flask.\\n\\n Chani pushed away from him. \"She cannot be forgiven!\"\\n\\n \"Who said anything about forgiving?\"\\n\\n \"They why shouldn\u0027t I kill her?\"\\n\\n It was such a flat, Fremen question that Paul felt himself almost overcome by a hysterical desire to laugh. He covered it by saying: \"It wouldn\u0027t help.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve seen that?\"\\n\\n Paul felt his belly tighten with vision-memory.\\n\\n \"What I\u0027ve seen... what I\u0027ve seen...\" he muttered. Every aspect of surrounding events fitted a present which paralyzed him. He felt chained to a future which, exposed too often, had locked onto him like a greedy succubus. Tight dryness clogged his throat. Had he followed the witchcall of his own oracle, he wondered, until it\u0027d spilled him into a merciless present?\\n\\n \"Tell me what you\u0027ve seen,\" Chani said.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"Why mustn\u0027t I kill her?\"\\n\\n \"Because I ask it.\"\\n\\n He watched her accept this. She did it the way sand accepted water: absorbing and concealing. Was there obedience beneath that hot, angry surface? he wondered. And he realized then that life in the royal Keep had left Chani unchanged. She\u0027d merely stopped here for a time, inhabited a way station on a journey with her man. Nothing of the desert had been taken from her.\\n\\n Chani stepped away from him then, glanced at the ghola who stood waiting near the diamond circle of the practice door.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve been crossing blades with him?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"And I\u0027m better for it.\"\\n\\n Her gaze went to the circle on the floor, back to the ghola\u0027s metallic eyes.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like it,\" she said.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s not intended to do me violence,\" Paul said.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve seen that?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve not seen it!\"\\n\\n \"Then how do you know?\"\\n\\n \"Because he\u0027s more than ghola; he\u0027s Duncan Idaho.\"\\n\\n \"The Bene Tleilax made him.\"\\n\\n \"They made more than they intended.\"\\n\\n She shook her head. A corner of her nezhoni scarf rubbed the collar of her robe. \"How can you change the fact that he is ghola?\"\\n\\n \"Hayt,\" Paul said, \"are you the tool of my undoing?\"\\n\\n \"If the substance of here and now is changed, the future is changed,\" the ghola said.\\n\\n \"That is no answer!\" Chani objected.\\n\\n Paul raised his voice: \"How will I die, Hayt?\"\\n\\n Light glinted from the artificial eyes. \"It is said, m\u0027Lord, that you will die of money and power.\"\\n\\n Chani stiffened. \"How dare he speak thus to you?\"\\n\\n \"The mentat is truthful,\" Paul said.\\n\\n \"Was Duncan Idaho a real friend?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"He gave his life for me.\"\\n\\n \"It is sad,\" Chani whispered, \"that a ghola cannot be restored to his original being.\"\\n\\n \"Would you convert me?\" the ghola asked, directing his gaze to Chani.\\n\\n \"What does he mean?\" Chani asked.\\n\\n \"To be converted is to be turned around,\" Paul said. \"But there\u0027s no going back.\"\\n\\n \"Every man carries his own past with him,\" Hayt said.\\n\\n \"And every ghola?\" Paul asked.\\n\\n \"In a way, m\u0027Lord.\"\\n\\n \"Then what of that past in your secret flesh?\" Paul asked.\\n\\n Chani saw how the question disturbed the ghola. His movements quickened, hands clenched into fists. She glanced at Paul, wondering why he probed thus. Was there a way to restore this creature to the man he\u0027d been?\\n\\n \"Has a ghola ever remembered his real past?\" Chani asked.\\n\\n \"Many attempts have been made,\" Hayt said, his gaze fixed on the floor near his feet. \"No ghola has ever been restored to his former being.\"\\n\\n \"But you long for this to happen,\" Paul said.\\n\\n The blank surfaces of the ghola\u0027s eyes came up to center on Paul with a pressing intensity. \"Yes!\"\\n\\n Voice soft, Paul said: \"If there\u0027s a way...\"\\n\\n \"This flesh,\" Hayt said, touching left hand to forehead in a curious saluting movement, \"is not the flesh of my original birth. It is... reborn. Only the shape is familiar. A Face Dancer might do as well.\"\\n\\n \"Not as well,\" Paul said. \"And you\u0027re not a Face Dancer.\"\\n\\n \"That is true, m\u0027Lord.\"\\n\\n \"Whence comes your shape?\"\\n\\n \"The genetic imprint of the original cells.\"\\n\\n \"Somewhere,\" Paul said, \"there\u0027s a plastic something which remembers the shape of Duncan Idaho. It\u0027s said the ancients probed this region before the Butlerian Jihad. What\u0027s the extent of this memory, Hayt? What did it learn from the original?\"\\n\\n The ghola shrugged.\\n\\n \"What if he wasn\u0027t Idaho?\" Chani asked.\\n\\n \"He was.\"\\n\\n \"Can you be certain?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"He is Duncan in every aspect. I cannot imagine a force strong enough to hold that shape thus without any relaxation or any deviation.\"\\n\\n \"M\u0027Lord!\" Hayt objected. \"Because we cannot imagine a thing, that doesn\u0027t exclude it from reality. There are things I must do as a ghola that I would not do as a man.\"\\n\\n Keeping his attention on Chani, Paul said: \"You see?\" She nodded.\\n\\n Paul turned away, fighting deep sadness. He crossed to the balcony windows, drew the draperies. Lights came on in the sudden gloom. He pulled the sash of his robe tight, listened for sounds behind him.\\n\\n Nothing.\\n\\n He turned. Chani stood as though entranced, her gaze centered on the ghola.\\n\\n Hayt, Paul saw, had retreated to some inner chamber of his being - had gone back to the ghola place.\\n\\n Chani turned at the sound of Paul\u0027s return. She still felt the thralldom of the instant Paul had precipitated. For a brief moment, the ghola had been an intense, vital human being. For that moment, he had been someone she did not fear - indeed, someone she liked and admired. Now, she understood Paul\u0027s purpose in this probing. He had wanted her to see the man in the ghola flesh.\\n\\n She stared at Paul. \"That man, was that Duncan Idaho?\"\\n\\n \"That was Duncan Idaho. He is still there.\"\\n\\n \"Would he have allowed Irulan to go on living?\" Chani asked.\\n\\n The water didn\u0027t sink too deep, Paul thought. And he said: \"If I commanded it.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t understand,\" she said. \"Shouldn\u0027t you be angry?\"\\n\\n \"I am angry.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t sound... angry. You sound sorrowful.\"\\n\\n He closed his eyes. \"Yes. That, too.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dune-messiah-dune-chronicles-2/page-15.html","bookId":2154,"book":{"id":2154,"title":"Dune Messiah (Dune Chronicles #2)","description":"Storyline: Dune Messiah (Dune Chronicles #2) \\n Dune Messiah is a science fiction novel by Frank Herbert, the second in a series of six novels.
