His hands gripped the wheel rigidly as he made a tight U turn and started back toward Gardena.\\n\\n What a fool he\u0027d been! It must have taken at least an hour to reach the cemetery. He must have been in the crypt for hours. Then going to get that woman. Going to the market, drinking the tomato juice, going back to get the woman again.\\n\\n What time was it?\\n\\n Fool! Cold fear poured through his veins at the thought of them all waiting for him at his house. Oh, my God, and he\u0027d left the garage door open! The gasoline, the equipment--the generator!\\n\\n A groan cut itself off in his throat as he jammed the gas pedal to the floor and the small station wagon leaped ahead, the speedometer needle fluttering, then moving steadily past the sixty-five mark, the seventy, the seventy-five. What if they were already waiting for him? How could he possibly get in the house?\\n\\n He forced himself to be calm. He mustn\u0027t go to pieces now; he had to keep himself in check. He\u0027d get in. Don\u0027t worry, you\u0027ll get inside, he told himself. But he didn\u0027t see how.\\n\\n One hand ran nervously through his hair. This is fine, fine, commented his mind. You go to all that trouble to preserve your existence, and then one day you just don\u0027t come back in time. Shut up! his mind snapped back at itself. But he could have killed himself for forgetting to wind his watch the night before. Don\u0027t bother killing yourself, his mind reflected, they\u0027ll be glad to do it for you. Suddenly he realized he was almost weak from hunger.\\n\\n The small amount of canned meat he\u0027d eaten with the tomato juice had done nothing to alleviate hunger.\\n\\n The silent streets flew past and he kept looking from side to side to see if any of them were appearing in the doorways. It seemed as if it were already getting dark, but that could have been imagination. It couldn\u0027t be that late, it couldn\u0027t be.\\n\\n He\u0027d just gone hurtling past the corner of Western and Compton when he saw the man come running out of a building and shout at him. His heart was contracted in an icy hand as the man\u0027s cry fluttered in the air behind the car.\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t get any more speed out of the station wagon. And now his mind began torturing him with visions of one of the tires going, the station wagon veering, leaping the curb and crashing into a house. His lips started to shake and he jammed them together to stop them. His hands on the wheel felt numb.\\n\\n He had to slow down at the corner of Cimarron. Out of the corner of an eye he saw a man come rushing out of a house and start chasing the car.\\n\\n Then, as he turned the corner with a screech of clinging tires, he couldn\u0027t hold back the gasp.\\n\\n They were all in front of his house, waiting.\\n\\n A sound of helpless terror filled his throat. He didn\u0027t want to die. He might have thought about it, even contemplated it. But he didn\u0027t want to die. Not like this.\\n\\n Now he saw them all turn their white faces at the sound of the motor. Some more of them came running out of the open garage and his teeth ground together in impotent fury. What a stupid, brainless way to die!\\n\\n Now be saw them start running straight toward the station wagon, a line of them across the street. And; suddenly, he knew he couldn\u0027t stop. He pressed down on the accelerator, and in a moment the car went plowing through them, knocking three of them aside like tenpins. He felt the car frame jolt as it struck the bodies. Their screaming white faces went flashing by his window, their cries chilling his blood.\\n\\n Now they were behind and he saw in the rear-view mirror that they were all pursuing him. A sudden plan caught hold in his mind, and impulsively he slowed down, even braking, until the speed of the car fell to thirty, then twenty miles an hour.\\n\\n He looked back and saw them gaining, saw their grayish-white faces approaching, their dark eyes fastened to his car, to him.\\n\\n Suddenly he twitched with shock as a snarl sounded nearby and, jerking his head around, he saw the crazed face of Ben Cortman beside the car.\\n\\n Instinctively his foot jammed down on the gas pedal, but his other foot slipped off the clutch, and with a neck-snapping jolt the station wagon jumped forward and stalled.\\n\\n Sweat broke out on his forehead as he lunged forward feverishly to press the button. Ben Cortman clawed in at him.\\n\\n With a snarl he shoved the cold white hand aside.\\n\\n \"Neville, Neville!\"\\n\\n Ben Cortman reached in again, his hands like claws cut from ice. Again Neville pushed aside the hand and jabbed at the starter button, his body shaking helplessly. Behind, he could hear them all screaming excitedly as they came closer to the car.\\n\\n The motor coughed into life again as he felt Ben Cortman\u0027s long nails rake across his cheek.\\n\\n \"Neville!\"\\n\\n The pain made his hand jerk into a rigid fist, which he drove into Cortman\u0027s face. Cortman went flailing back onto the pavement as the gears caught and the station wagon jolted forward, picking up speed. One of the others caught up and leaped at the rear of the car. For a minute he held on, and Robert Neville could see his ashen face glaring insanely through the back window. Then he jerked the car over toward the curb, swerved sharply, and shook the man off. The man went running across a lawn, arms ahead of him, and smashed violently into the side of a house.\\n\\n Robert Neville\u0027s heart was pounding so heavily now it seemed as if it would drive through his chest walls. Breath shuddered in him and his flesh felt number and cold. He could feel the trickle of blood on his cheek, but no pain. Hastily he wiped it off with one shaking hand.\\n\\n Now he spun the station wagon around the corner, turning right. He kept looking at the rear-view mirror, then looking ahead. He went the short block to Haas Street and turned right again. What if they cut through the yards and blocked his way?\\n\\n He slowed down a little until they came swarming around the corner like a pack of wolves. Then he pressed down on the accelerator. He\u0027d have to take the chance that they were all following him. Would some of them guess what he was trying?\\n\\n He shoved down the gas pedal all the way and the station wagon jumped forward, racing up the block. He wheeled it around the corner at fifty miles an hour, gunned up the short block to Cimarron, and turned right again.\\n\\n His breath caught. There was no one in sight on his lawn. There was still a chance, then. He\u0027d have to let the station wagon go, though; there was no time to put it in the garage.\\n\\n He jerked the car to the curb and shoved the door open. As he raced around the edge of the car he heard the billowing cry of their approach around the corner.\\n\\n He\u0027d have to take a chance on locking the garage. If he didn\u0027t, they might destroy the generator; they couldn\u0027t have had time to do it already. His footsteps pounded up the driveway to the garage.\\n\\n \"Neville!\"\\n\\n His body jerked back as Cortman came lunging out of the dark shadows of the garage.\\n\\n Cortman\u0027s body drove into his and almost knocked him down. He fell the cold, powerful hands clamp on his throat and smelled the fetid breath clouding over his face. The two of them went reeling back toward the sidewalk and the white-fanged mouth went darting down at Robert Neville\u0027s throat\\n\\n Abruptly he jerked up his right fist and felt it drive into Cortman\u0027s throat. He heard the choking sound in Cortman\u0027s throat. Up the block the first of them came rushing and screaming around the corner.\\n\\n With a violent movement, Robert Neville grabbed Cortman by his long, greasy hair and sent him hurtling down the driveway until he rammed head on into the side of the station wagon.\\n\\n Robert Neville\u0027s eyes flashed up the street. No time for the garage! He dashed around the corner of the house and up to the porch.\\n\\n He skidded to a halt. Oh, God, the keys!\\n\\n With a terrified intake of breath he spun and rushed back toward the car. Cortman started up with a throaty snarl and he drove his knee into the white face and knocked Cortman back on the sidewalk. Then he lunged into the car and jerked the key chain away from the ignition slot.\\n\\n As he scuttled back out of the car the first one of them came leaping at him.\\n\\n He shrank back onto the car seat and the man tripped over his legs and went sprawling heavily onto the side walk. Robert Neville pushed himself out, dashed across the lawn, and leaped onto the porch.\\n\\n He had to stop to find the right key and another man came leaping up the porch steps. Neville was slammed against the house by the impact of his body. The hot blood thick breath was on him again, the bared mouth lunging at his throat. He drove his knee into the man\u0027s groin and then, leaning his weight against the house, he raised his foot high and shoved the doubled over man into the other one who was rushing across the lawn.\\n\\n Neville dived for the door and unlocked it. He pushed it open, slipped inside, and turned. As he slammed it shut an arm shot through the opening. He forced the door against it with all his strength until he heard bones snap, then he opened the door a little, shoved the broken arm out, and slammed the door. With trembling hands he dropped the bar into place.\\n\\n Slowly he sank down onto the floor and fell on his back. He lay there in the darkness, his chest rising and falling, his legs and arms like dead limbs on the floor. Outside they howled and pummeled the door, shouting his name in a paroxysm of demented fury. They grabbed up bricks and rocks and hurled them against the house and they screamed and cursed at him. He lay there listening to the thud of the rocks and bricks against the house, listening to their howling.\\n\\n After a while he struggled up to the bar. Half the whisky he poured splashed onto the rug. He threw down the contents of the glass and stood there shivering, holding onto the bar to support his wobbling legs, his throat tight and convulsed; his lips shaking without control.\\n\\n Slowly the heat of the liquor expanded in his stomach and reached his body. His breath slowed down, his chest stopped shuddering.\\n\\n He started as he heard the great crash outside.\\n\\n He ran to the peephole and looked out. His teeth grated together and a burst of rage filled him as be saw the station wagon lying on its side and saw them smashing in the windshield with bricks and stones, tearing open the hood and smashing at the engine with insane club strokes, denting the frame with their frenzied blows. As he watched, fury poured through him like a current of hot acid and half formed curses sounded in his throat while his hands clamped into great white fists at his sides.\\n\\n Turning suddenly, he moved to the lamp and tried to light it. It didn\u0027t work. With a snarl he turned and ran into the kitchen. The refrigerator was out. He ran from one dark room to another. The freezer was off; all the food would spoil. His house was a dead house.\\n\\n Fury exploded in him. Enough!\\n\\n His rage palsied hands ripped out the clothes from the bureau drawer until they closed on the loaded pistols.\\n\\n Racing through the dark living room, he knocked up the bar across the door and sent it clattering to the floor. Outside, they howled as they heard him opening the door. I\u0027m coming out, you bastards! his mind screamed out.\\n\\n He jerked open the door and shot the first one in the face. The man went spinning back off the porch and two women came at him in muddy, torn dresses, their white arms spread to enfold him. He watched their bodies jerk as the bullets struck them, then he shoved them both aside and began firing his guns into their midst, a wild yell ripping back his bloodless lips.\\n\\n He kept firing the pistols until they were both empty.\\n\\n Then be stood on the porch clubbing them with insane blows, losing his mind almost completely when the same ones he\u0027d shot came rushing at him again. And when they tore the guns out of his hands he used his fists and elbows and he butted with his head and kicked them with his big shoes.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t until the flaring pain of having his shoulder slashed open struck him that he realized what he was doing and how hopeless his attempt was. Knocking aside two women, he backed toward the door. A man\u0027s arm locked around his neck. He lurched forward, bending at the waist, and toppled the man over his head into the others. He jumped back into the doorway, gripped both sides of the frame and kicked out his legs like pistons, sending the men crashing back into the shrubbery.\\n\\n Then, before they could get at him again, he slammed the door in their faces, locked it, bolted it, and dropped the heavy bar into its slots.\\n\\n Robert Neville stood in the cold blackness of his house, listening to the vampires scream.\\n\\n He stood against the wall clubbing slowly and weekly at the plaster, tears streaming down his bearded cheeks, his bleeding hand pulsing with pain. Everything was gone, everything.\\n\\n \"Virginia,\" he sobbed like a lost, frightened child. \"Virginia. Virginia.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/i-am-legend/page-5.html","bookId":2455,"book":{"id":2455,"title":"I Am Legend","description":"Storyline: Robert Neville is the last living man on Earth... but he is not alone.
