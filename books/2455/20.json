Came from the blackness with a great sound of motors, the long white arms of their spotlights snapping around the boulevard corner and clutching out at Cimarron Street.\n Robert Neville was sitting at the peephole when they came. He had put down a book and was sitting there watching idly when the beams splashed white across the bloodless vampire faces and they whirled with a gasp, their dark animal eyes staring at the blinding lights.\n Neville jumped back from the peephole, his heart thudding with the abrupt shock. For a moment he stood there trembling in the dark room, unable to decide what to do. His throat contracted and he heard the roar of the car motors even through the soundproofing on his house. He thought of the pistols in his bureau, the sub-machine gun on his workbench, thought of defending his house against them.\n Then he pressed his fingers in until the nails dug at his palms. No, he\u0027d made his decision, he\u0027d worked it out carefully through the past months. He would not fight.\n With a heavy, sinking sensation in the pit of his stomach he stepped back to the peephole and looked out.\n The street was a scene of rushing, violent action illuminated by the bald glare of the spotlights. Men rushed at men, the sound of running boots covered the pavement. Then a shot rang out, echoing hollowly; more shots.\n Two male vampires went thrashing down onto their sides. Four men grabbed them by the arms and jerked them up while two other men drove the glittering lance points of their pikes into the vampires\u0027 chests. Neville\u0027s face twitched as screams filled the night. He felt his chest shuddering with labored breath as he watched from his house.\n The dark-suited men knew exactly what they were doing. There were about seven vampires visible, six men and a woman. The men surrounded the seven, held their flailing arms, and drove razor-tipped pikes deep into their bodies. Blood spouted out on the dark pavement and the vampires perished one by one. Neville felt himself shivering more and more. Is this the new society? The words flashed across his mind. He tried to believe that the men were forced into what they were doing, but shock brought terrible doubt. Did they have to do it like this, with such a black and brutal slaughtering? Why did they slay with alarum by night, when by day the vampires could be dispatched in peace?\n Robert Neville felt tight fists shaking at his sides. He didn\u0027t like the looks of them, he didn\u0027t like the methodical butchery. They were more like gangsters than men forced into a situation. There were looks of vicious triumph on their faces, white and stark in the spotlights. Their faces were cruel and emotionless.\n Suddenly Neville felt himself shudder violently, remembering. Where was Ben Cortman?\n His eyes fled over the street but he couldn\u0027t see Cortman. He pressed against the peephole and looked up and down the street. He didn\u0027t want them to get Cortman, he realized, didn\u0027t want them to destroy Cortman like that. With a sense of inward shock he could not analyze in the rush of the moment, he realized that he felt more deeply toward the vampires than he did toward their executioners.\n Now the seven vampires lay crumpled and still in their pools of stolen blood. The spotlights were moving around the street, flaying open the night. Neville turned his head away as the brilliant glare blazed across the front of his house. Then the spotlight had turned about and he looked again.\n A shout. Neville\u0027s eyes jumped toward the focus of the spotlights.\n He stiffened.\n Cortman was on the roof of the house across the street. He was pulling himself up toward the chimney, body flattened on the shingles.\n Abruptly it came to Neville that it was in that chimney that Ben Cortman had hidden most of the time, and he felt a wrench of despair at the knowledge. His lips pressed together tightly. Why hadn\u0027t he looked more carefully? He couldn\u0027t fight the sick apprehension he felt at the thought of Cortman\u0027s being killed by these brutal strangers. Objectively, it was pointless, but he could not repress the feeling. Cortman was not theirs to put to rest.\n But there was nothing he could do.\n With bleak, tortured eyes he watched the spotlights cluster on Cortman\u0027s wriggling body. He watched the white hands reaching out slowly for handholds on the roof. Slowly, slowly, as if Cortman had all the time in the world. Hurry up! Neville felt himself twitch with the unspoken words as he watched. He felt himself straining with Cortman\u0027s agonizingly slow movements.\n The men did not shout, they did not command. They raised their rifles now and the night was torn open again with their exploding fire.\n Neville almost felt the bullets in his own flesh. His body jerked with convulsive shudders as he watched Cortman\u0027s body jerk under the impact of the bullets.\n Still Cortman kept crawling, and Neville saw his white face, his teeth gritted together. The end of Oliver Hardy, he thought, the death of all comedy and all laughter. He didn\u0027t hear the continuous fusillade of shots. He didn\u0027t even feel the tears running down his cheeks. His eyes were riveted on the ungainly form of his old friend inching up the brightly lit roof.\n Now Cortman rose up on his knees and clutched at the chimney edge with spasmodic fingers. His body lurched as more bullets struck. His dark eyes glared into the blinding spotlights, his lips were drawn back in a soundless snarl.\n Then he was standing up beside the chimney and Neville\u0027s face was white and taut as he watched Cortman start to raise his right leg.\n And then the hammering machine gun splattered Cortman\u0027s flesh with lead. For a moment Cortman stood erect in the hot blast, palsied hands raised high over his head, a look of berserk defiance twisting his white features.\n \"Ben,\" Neville muttered in a croaking whisper.\n Ben Cortman\u0027s body folded, slumped forward, fell. It slid and rolled slowly down the shingled incline, then dropped into space. In the sudden silence Neville heard the thump of it from across the street. Sick-eyed, he watched the men rush at the writhing body with their pikes.\n Then Neville closed his eyes and his nails dug furrows in the flesh of his palms.\n A clumping of boots. Neville jerked back into the darkness. He stood in the middle of the room, waiting for them to call to him and tell him to come out. He held himself rigidly. I\u0027m not going to fight, he told himself strongly. Even though he wanted to fight, even though he already hated the dark men with their guns and their bloodstained pikes.\n But he wasn\u0027t going to fight. He had worked out his decision very carefully. They were doing what they had to do, albeit with unnecessary violence and seeming relish. He had killed their people and they had to capture him and save themselves. He would not fight. He\u0027d throw himself upon the justice of their new society. When they called to him he would go out and surrender, it was his decision.\n But they didn\u0027t call. Neville lurched back with a gasp as the ax blade bit deeply into the front door. He stood trembling in the dark living room. What were they doing? Why didn\u0027t they call on him to surrender? He wasn\u0027t a vampire, he was a man like them. What were they doing?\n He whirled and stared at the kitchen. They were chopping at the boarded-up back door too. He took a nervous step toward the hallway. His frightened eyes rushed from the back to the front door. He felt his heart pumping. He didn\u0027t understand, he didn\u0027t understand!\n With a grunt of shocked surprise he jumped into the hall as the enclosed house rang with the gun explosion. The men were shooting away the lock on the front door. Another reverberating shot made his ears ring.\n And, suddenly, he knew. They weren\u0027t going to take him to their courts, to their justice. They were going to exterminate him.\n With a frightened murmur he ran into the bedroom. His hands fumbled in the bureau drawer.\n He straightened up on trembling legs, the guns in his hands. But what if they were going to take him prisoner? He\u0027d only judged by the fact that they hadn\u0027t called on him to come out. There were no lights in the house; maybe they thought he was already gone.\n He stood shivering in the darkness of the bedroom, not knowing what to do, mutters of terror filling his throat Why hadn\u0027t he left! Why hadn\u0027t he listened to her and left? Fool!\n One of his guns fell from nerveless fingers as the front door was crushed in. Heavy feet thudded into the living room and Robert Neville shuffled back across the floor, his remaining pistol held out with rigid, blood-drained fingers. They weren\u0027t going to kill him without a fight!\n He gasped as he collided with the bench. He stood there tautly. In the front room a man said something he couldn\u0027t understand, then flashlight beams shone into the hall. Neville caught his breath. He felt the room spinning around him. So this is the end. It was the only thing he could think. So this is the end.\n Heavy shoes thumped in the hall. Neville\u0027s fingers tightened still more on the pistol and his eyes stared with wild fright at the doorway.\n Two men came in.\n Their white beams played around the room, struck his face. The two men recoiled abruptly.\n \"He\u0027s got a gun!\" one of them cried, and fired his pistol.\n Neville heard the bullet smash into the wall over his head. Then the pistol was jolting in his hand, splashing his face with bursts of light. He didn\u0027t fire at any one of them; he just kept pulling the trigger automatically. One of the men cried out in pain.\n Then Neville felt a violent club blow across his chest. He staggered back, and jagged, burning pain exploded in his body. He fired once more, then crashed to his knees, the pistol slipping from his fingers.\n \"You got him!\" he heard someone cry as he fell on his face. He tried to reach out for the pistol but a dark boot stamped on his hand and broke it. Neville drew in his hand with a rattling gasp and stared through pain-glazed eyes at the floor.\n Rough hands slid under his armpits and pulled him up. He kept wondering when they would shoot him again. Virge, he thought, Virge, I\u0027m coming with you now. The pain in his chest was like molten lead poured over him from a great height. He felt and heard his boot tips scraping over the floor and waited for death. I want to die in my own house, he thought. He struggled feebly but they didn\u0027t stop. Hot pain raked saw-toothed nails through his chest as they dragged him through the front room.\n \"No,\" he groaned. \"No!\"\n Then pain surged up from his chest and drove a barbed club into his brain. Everything began spinning away into blackness.\n \"Virge,\" he muttered in a hoarse whisper.\n And the dark men dragged his lifeless body from the house. Into the night. Into the world that was theirs and no longer his. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/i-am-legend/page-20.html","bookId":2455,"book":{"id":2455,"title":"I Am Legend","description":"Storyline: \n Robert Neville is the last living man on Earth... but he is not alone.
