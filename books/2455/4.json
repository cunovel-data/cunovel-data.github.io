{"id":80713,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"THE ALARM NEVER WENT off because he\u0027d forgotten to set it. He slept soundly and motionlessly, his body like cast iron. When he finally opened his eyes, it was ten o\u0027clock.\n With a disgusted muttering, he struggled up and dropped his legs over the side of the bed. Instantly his head began throbbing as if his brains were trying to force their way through his skull. Fine, he thought, a hangover. That\u0027s all I need.\n He pushed himself up with a groan and stumbled into the bathroom, threw water in his face and splashed some over his head. No good, his mind complained, no good. I still feel like hell. In the mirror his face was gaunt, bearded, and very much like the face of a man in his forties. Love, your magic spell is everywhere; inanely, the words flapped across his brain like wet sheets in a wind.\n He walked slowly into the living room and opened the front door. A curse fell thickly from his lips at the sight of the woman crumpled across the sidewalk. He started to tighten angrily, but it made his head throb too much and he had to let it go. I\u0027m sick, he thought.\n The sky was gray and dead. Great! he thought. Another day stuck in this boarded-up rat hole! He slammed the door viciously, then winced, groaning, at the brain-stabbing noise. Outside, he heard the rest of the mirror fall out and shatter on the porch cement. Oh, great! His lips contorted back into a white twist of flesh.\n Two cups of burning black coffee only made his stomach feel worse. He put down the cup and went into the living room. To hell with it, he thought, I\u0027ll get drunk again.\n But the liquor tasted like turpentine, and with a rasping snarl he flung the glass against the wall and stood watching the liquor run down onto the rug. Hell, I\u0027m runnin\u0027 out of glasses. The thought irritated him while breath struggled in through his nostrils and out again in faltering bursts.\n He sank down on the couch and sat there, shaking his head slowly. It was no use; they\u0027d beaten him, the black bastards had beaten him.\n That restless feeling again; the feeling as if he were expanding and the house were contracting and any second now he\u0027d go bursting through its frame in an explosion of wood, plaster, and brick. He got up and moved quickly to the door, his hands shaking.\n On the lawn, he stood sucking in a great lungful of the wet morning air, his face turned away from the house he hated. But he hated the other houses around there too, and he hated the pavement and the sidewalks and the lawns and everything that was on Cimarron Street.\n It kept building up. And suddenly he knew he had to get out of there. Cloudy day or not, he had to get out of there.\n He locked the front door, unlocked the garage, and dragged up the thick door on its overhead hinges. He didn\u0027t bother putting down the door. I\u0027ll be back soon, he thought. I\u0027ll just go away for a while.\n He backed the station wagon quickly down the driveway, jerked it around, and pressed down hard on the accelerator, heading for Compton Boulevard. He didn\u0027t know where he was going.\n He went around the corner doing forty and jumped that to sixty-five before he\u0027d gone another block. The car leaped forward under his foot and he kept the accelerator on the floor, forced down by a rigid leg. His hands were like carved ice on the wheel and his face was the face of a statue. At eighty-nine miles an hour, he shot down the lifeless, empty boulevard, one roaring sound in the great stillness.\n Things rank and gross in nature possess it merely, he thought as he walked slowly across the cemetery lawn.\n The grass was so high that the weight of it had bent it over and it crunched under his heavy shoes as he walked. There was no sound but that of his shoes and the now senseless singing of birds. Once I thought they sang because everything was right with the world, Robert Neville thought, I know now I was wrong. They sing because they\u0027re feeble-minded.\n He had raced six miles, the gas pedal pressed to the floor, before he\u0027d realized where he was going. It was strange the way his mind and body had kept it secret from his consciousness. Consciously, he\u0027d known only that he was sick and depressed and had to get away from the house. He didn\u0027t know he was going to visit Virginia.\n But he\u0027d driven there directly and as fast as he could. He\u0027d parked at the curb and entered through the rusted gate, and now his shoes were pressing and crackling through the thick grass.\n How long had it been since he\u0027d come here? It must have been at least a month. He wished he\u0027d brought flowers, but then, he hadn\u0027t realized he was coming here until he was almost at the gate.\n His lips pressed together as an old sorrow held him again. Why couldn\u0027t he have Kathy there too? Why had he followed so blindly, listening to those fools who set up their stupid regulations during the plague? If only she could be there, lying across from her mother.\n Don\u0027t start that again, he ordered himself.\n Drawing closer to the crypt, he stiffened as he noticed that the iron door was slightly ajar. Oh, no, he thought. He broke into a run across the wet grass. If they\u0027ve been at her, I\u0027ll burn down the city, he vowed. I swear to God, I\u0027ll burn it to the ground if they\u0027ve touched her.\n He flung open the door and it clanged against the marble wall with a hollow, echoing sound. His eyes moved quickly to the marble base on which the sealed casket rested.\n The tension sank; he drew in breath again. It was still there, untouched.\n Then, as he started in, he saw the man lying in one corner of the crypt, body curled upon the cold floor.\n With a grunt of rage, Robert Neville rushed at the body, and, grabbing the man\u0027s coat in taut fingers, he dragged him across the floor and flung him violently out onto the grass. The body rolled onto its back, the white face pointing at the sky.\n Robert Neville went back into the crypt, chest rising and falling with harsh movements. Then he closed his eyes and stood with his palms resting on the cover of the casket.\n I\u0027m here, he thought. I\u0027m back. Remember me.\n He threw out the flowers he\u0027d brought the time before and cleared away the few leaves that had blown in because the door had been opened.\n Then he sat down beside the casket and rested his forehead against its cold metal side.\n Silence held him in its cold and gentle hands.\n If I could die now, be thought; peacefully, gently, without a tremor or a crying out, if I could be with her. If I could believe I would be with her.\n His fingers tightened slowly and his head sank forward on his chest.\n Virginia. Take me where you are.\n A tear, crystal, fell across his motionless hand...\n He had no idea how long he\u0027d been there. After a while, though, even the deepest sorrow faltered, even the most penetrating despair lost its scalpel edge. The flagellant\u0027s curse, he thought, to grow inured even to the whip.\n He straightened up and stood. Still alive, he thought, heart beating senselessly, veins running without point, bones and muscles and tissue all alive and functioning with no purpose at all.\n A moment longer he stood looking down at the casket, then he turned away with a sigh and left, closing the door behind him quietly so as not to disturb her sleep.\n He\u0027d forgotten about the man. He almost tripped over him now, stepping aside with a muttered curse and starting past the body.\n Then, abruptly, he turned back.\n What\u0027s this? He looked down incredulously at the man. The man was dead; really dead. But how could that be? The change had occurred so quickly, yet already the man looked and smelled as though he\u0027d been dead for days.\n His mind began churning with a sudden excitement. Something had killed the vampire; something brutally effective. The heart had not been touched, no garlic had been present, and yet...\n It came, seemingly, without effort. Of course--the daylight!\n A bolt of self-accusation struck him. To know for five months that they remained indoors by day and never once to make the connection! He closed his eyes, appalled by his own stupidity.\n The rays of the sun; the infrared and ultraviolet. It had to be them. But why? Damn it, why didn\u0027t he know anything about the effects of sunlight on the human system?\n Another thought: That man had been one of the true vampires; the living dead. Would sunlight have the same effect on those who were still alive?\n The first excitement he\u0027d felt in months made him break into a run for the station wagon.\n As the door slammed shut beside him, he wondered if he should have taken away the dead man. Would the body attract others, would they invade the crypt? No, they wouldn\u0027t go near the casket, anyway. It was sealed with garlic. Besides, the man\u0027s blood was dead now, it--Again his thoughts broke off as he leaped to another conclusion. The sun\u0027s rays must have done something to their blood!\n Was it possible, then, that all things bore relations to the blood? The garlic, the cross, the mirror, the stake, daylight, the earth some of them slept in? He didn\u0027t see how, and yet...\n He had to do a lot of reading, a lot of research. It might be just the thing he needed. He\u0027d been planning for a long time to do it, but lately it seemed as if he\u0027d forgotten it altogether. Now this new idea started the desire again.\n He started, the car and raced up the street, turning off into a residential section and pulling up before the first house he came to.\n He ran up the pathway to the front door, but it was locked and he couldn\u0027t force it in. With an impatient growl, he ran to the next house. The door was open and he ran to the stairs through the darkened living room and jumped up the carpeted steps two at a time.\n He found the woman in the bedroom. Without hesitation, he jerked back the covers and grabbed her by the wrists. She grunted as her body hit the floor, and he heard her making tiny sounds in her throat as he dragged her into the hall and started down the stairs.\n As he pulled her across the living room, she started to move.\n Her hands closed over his wrists and her body began to twist and flop on the rug. Her eyes were still closed, but she gasped and muttered and her body kept trying to writhe out of his grip. Her dark nails dug into his flesh. He tore out of her grasp with a snarl and dragged her the rest of the way by her hair. Usually he felt a twinge when he realized that, but for some affliction he didn\u0027t understand, these people were the same as he. But now an experimental fervor had seized him and he could think of nothing else.\n Even so, he shuddered at the strangled sound of horror she made when he threw her on the sidewalk outside.\n She lay twisting helplessly on the sidewalk, hands opening and closing, lips drawn back from red-spotted lips.\n Robert Neville watched her tensely.\n His throat moved. It wouldn\u0027t last, the feeling of callous brutality. He bit his lips as he watched her. All right, she\u0027s suffering, he argued with himself, but she\u0027s one of them and she\u0027d kill me gladly if she got the chance. You\u0027ve got to look at it that way, it\u0027s the only way. Teeth clenched, he stood there and watched her die.\n In a few minutes she stopped moving, stopped muttering, and her hands uncurled slowly like white blossoms on the cement. Robert Neville crouched down and felt for her heartbeat. There was none. Already her flesh was growing cold.\n He straightened up with a thin smile. It was true, then. He didn\u0027t need the stakes. After all this time, he\u0027d finally found a better method.\n Then his breath caught. But how did he know the woman was really dead? How could he know until sunset?\n The thought filled him with a new, more restless anger.\n Why did each question blight the answers before it?\n He thought about it as he sat drinking a can of tomato juice taken from the supermarket behind which he was parked.\n How was he going to know? He couldn\u0027t very well stay with the woman until sunset came.\n Take her home with you, fool.\n Again his eyes closed and he felt a shudder of irritation go through him. He was missing all the obvious answers today. Now he\u0027d have to go all the way back and find her, and he wasn\u0027t even sure where the house was.\n He started the motor and pulled away from the parking lot, glancing down at his watch. Three o\u0027clock. Plenty of time to get back before they came. He eased the gas pedal down and the station wagon pulled ahead faster.\n It took him about a half hour to relocate the house. The woman was still in the same position on the sidewalk. Putting on his gloves, Neville lowered the back gate of the station wagon and walked over to the woman. As be walked, he noticed her figure. No, don\u0027t start that again, for God\u0027s sake.\n He dragged the woman back to the station wagon and tossed her in. Then he closed the gate and took off his gloves. He held up the watch and looked at it. Three o\u0027clock. Plenty of time to--He jerked up the watch and held it against his ear, his heart suddenly jumping.\n The watch had stopped. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/i-am-legend/page-4.html","bookId":2455,"book":{"id":2455,"title":"I Am Legend","description":"Storyline: \n Robert Neville is the last living man on Earth... but he is not alone.
