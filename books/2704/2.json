{"id":73531,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"Sarah and Silas\n The bundle settled down into the Heap household and was called Jenna after Silas\u0027s mother.\n The youngest of the boys, Nicko, was only two when Jenna arrived, and he soon forgot about his brother Septimus. The older boys slowly forgot too. They loved their little baby sister and brought home all kinds of treasures for her from their Magyk classes at school.\n Sarah and Silas of course could not forget Septimus. Silas blamed himself for leaving Sarah alone while he went out to fetch the baby\u0027s herbs from the Physik Woman. Sarah just blamed herself for everything. Although she could hardly remember what had happened that terrible day, Sarah knew she had tried to breathe life back into her baby and had failed. And she remembered watching the Matron Midwife wrapping her little Septimus from head to toe in bandages and then running for the door, shouting over her shoulder, \"Dead!\"\n Sarah remembered that all right.\n But Sarah soon loved her little baby girl as much as she had loved her Septimus. For a while she was afraid that someone would come and take Jenna away too, but as the months passed and Jenna grew into a chubby, gurgling baby, Sarah relaxed and almost stopped worrying.\n Until one day when her best friend, Sally Mullin, arrived breathless on the doorstep. Sally Mullin was one of those people who knew everything that was going on in the Castle. She was a small, busy woman with wispy ginger hair that was forever escaping from her somewhat grubby cook\u0027s hat. She had a pleasant round face, a little chubby from finishing off too many cakes, and her clothes were generally covered in sprinkles of flour.\n Sally ran a small cafe down on the pontoon beside the river. The sign over the door announced:\n THE SALLY MULLIN TEA AND ALE HOUSE\n CLEAN ACCOMMODATION AVAILABLE\n NO RIFFRAFF\n There were no secrets in Sally Mullin\u0027s cafe. Anything and anyone arriving at the Castle by water was noticed and commented on, and most people coming to the Castle did prefer to arrive by boat. No one apart from Silas liked the dark tracks through the Forest that surrounded the castle. The Forest still had a bad wolverine problem at night and was infested with carnivorous trees. Then there were the Wendron Witches, who were always short of cash and had been known to set traps for the unwary traveler and leave them with little more than their shirt and socks.\n Sally Mullin\u0027s cafe was a busy, steaming hut perched precariously over the water. All shapes and sizes of boats would moor up at the cafe pontoon, and all sorts of people and animals would tumble out of them. Most decided to recover from their trip by having at least one of Sally\u0027s fierce beers and a slab of barley cake, and by telling the latest gossip. And anyone in the Castle with half an hour to spare and a rumbling tummy would soon find themselves on the well-trodden path down to the Port Gate, past the Riverside Amenity Rubbish Dump, and along the pontoon to Sally Mullin\u0027s Tea and Ale House.\n Sally made it her business to see Sarah every week and keep her up to date with everything. In Sally\u0027s opinion Sarah was much put-upon with seven children to care for, not to mention Silas Heap, who did very little as far as she could see. Sally\u0027s stories usually involved people Sarah had never heard of and would never meet, but Sarah looked forward to Sally\u0027s visits all the same and enjoyed hearing about what was going on around her. However, this time what Sally had to tell her was different. This was more serious than everyday gossip, and this time it did involve Sarah. And, for the first time ever, Sarah knew something about it that Sally did not.\n Sally swept in and closed the door conspiratorially behind her. \"I\u0027ve got some terrible news,\" she whispered.\n Sarah, who was trying to wipe breakfast from Jenna\u0027s face, and everywhere else that the baby had sprayed it, and clean up after the new wolfhound puppy all at the same time, was not really listening.\n \"Hello, Sally,\" she said. \"There\u0027s a clean space here. Come and sit down. Cup of tea?\"\n \"Yes, please. Sarah, can you believe this?\"\n \"What\u0027s that, then, Sally?\" asked Sarah, expecting to hear about the latest bad behavior in the cafe.\n \"The Queen. The Queen is dead!\"\n \"What?\" gasped Sarah. She lifted Jenna out of her chair and took her over to the corner of the room where her baby basket was. Sarah lay Jenna down for a nap. She believed that babies should be kept well away from bad news.\n \"Dead,\" repeated Sally unhappily.\n \"No!\" gasped Sarah. \"I don\u0027t believe it. She\u0027s just not well after her baby\u0027s birth. That\u0027s why she has not been seen since then.\"\n \"That\u0027s what the Custodian Guards have been saying, isn\u0027t it?\" asked Sally.\n \"Well, yes,\" admitted Sarah, pouring out the tea. \"But they are her bodyguards, so they must know. Though why the Queen has suddenly chosen to be guarded by such a bunch of thugs, I don\u0027t understand.\"\n Sally took the cup of tea that Sarah had placed in front of her.\n \"Ta. Mmm, lovely. Well, exactly...\" Sally lowered her voice and looked around as though expecting to find a Custodian Guard propped up in the corner, not that she necessarily would have noticed one amid all the mess in the Heaps\u0027 room. \"They are a bunch of thugs. In fact, they are the ones who killed her.\"\n \"Killed? She was killed?\" exclaimed Sarah.\n \"Shhh. Well, see here...\" Sally pulled her chair closer to Sarah. \"There\u0027s a story going around - and I have it from the horse\u0027s mouth...\"\n \"Which horse would that be, then?\" asked Sarah with a wry smile.\n \"Only Madam Marcia\" - looking triumphant, Sally sat back and folded her arms - \"that\u0027s who.\"\n \"What? How come you\u0027ve been mixing with the ExtraOrdinary Wizard? Did she drop by for a cup of tea?\"\n \"Almost. Terry Tarsal did. He had been up at the WizardTower delivering some really weird shoes that he had made for Madam Marcia. So when he had stopped moaning about her taste in shoes and how much he hated snakes, he said that he had overheard Marcia talking to one of the other Wizards. Endor, that little fat one, I think. Well, they said the Queen had been shot! By the Custodian Guards. One of their Assassins.\"\n Sarah could not believe what she was hearing. \"When?\" she breathed.\n \"Well, this is the really awful thing,\" whispered Sally excitedly. \"They said she was shot on the day her baby was born. Six whole months ago, and we knew nothing about it. It\u0027s terrible ... terrible. And they shot Mr. Alther too. Dead. That\u0027s how come Marcia took over...\"\n \"Alther\u0027s dead?\" gasped Sarah. \"I can\u0027t believe it. I really can\u0027t ... We all thought he\u0027d retired. Silas was his Apprentice years ago. He was lovely...\"\n \"Was he?\" asked Sally vaguely, eager to get on with the story. \"Well, that\u0027s not all, see. Because Terry reckoned that Marcia had rescued the Princess and had taken her away somewhere. Endor and Marcia were just chatting, really, wondering how she was getting along. But of course when they realized Terry was there with the shoes, they stopped. Marcia was very rude to him, he said. He felt a bit strange afterward, and he reckoned she\u0027d done a Forget Spell on him, but he\u0027d nipped behind a pillar when he saw her muttering and it didn\u0027t take properly. He\u0027s really upset about that as he can\u0027t remember whether she paid him for the shoes or not.\"\n Sally Mullin paused to draw breath and have a large gulp of tea.\n \"That poor little Princess. God help the little one. I wonder where she is now. Probably wasting away in some dungeon somewhere. Not like your little angel over there ... How is she doing?\"\n \"Oh, she\u0027s just fine,\" said Sarah, who usually would have talked at length about Jenna\u0027s snuffles and new tooth and how she could sit up and hold her own cup now. But just at that moment Sarah wanted to turn the attention away from Jenna - because Sarah had spent the last six months wonder\u0027 ing who her baby really was, and now she knew.\n Jenna was, thought Sarah, surely she must be ... the baby Princess\n For once Sarah was glad to wave good\u0027bye to Sally Mullin. She watched her bustle off down the corridor, and, as Sarah closed the door behind her, she breathed a sigh of relief. Then she rushed over to Jenna\u0027s basket.\n Sarah lifted Jenna up and held her in her arms. Jenna smiled at Sarah and reached out to grab her charm necklace.\n \"Well, little Princess,\" murmured Sarah, \"I always knew you were special, but I never dreamed you were our own Princess.\" The baby\u0027s dark violet eyes met Sarah\u0027s gaze and she looked solemnly at Sarah as if to say, Well, now you know.\n Sarah gently laid Jenna back in her baby basket. Her head was spinning and her hands shook as she poured herself another cup of tea. She found it hard to believe all that she had heard. The Queen was dead. And Alther too. Their Jenna was the heir to the Castle. The Princess. What was happening?\n Sarah spent the rest of the afternoon torn between gazing at Jenna, Princess Jenna, and worrying about what would happen if anyone found out where she was. Where was Silas when she needed him?\n Silas was enjoying a day\u0027s fishing with the boys.\n There was a small sandy beach in the bend of the river just along from The Ramblings. Silas was showing Nicko and Jo-Jo, the two youngest boys, how to tie their jam jars onto the end of a pole and dip them in the water. Jo-Jo had already caught three tiddlers, but Nicko kept dropping his and was getting upset.\n Silas picked Nicko up and took him over to see Erik and Edd, the five-year-old twins. Erik was daydreaming happily and dangling his foot in the warm, clear water. Edd was poking at something under a stone with a stick. It was a huge water beetle. Nicko wailed and clung on tightly around Silas\u0027s neck.\n Sam, who was nearly seven, was a serious fisherman. He had been given a proper fishing rod for his last birthday, and there were two small silver fish laid out on a rock beside him. He was about to reel in another. Nicko squealed with excitement.\n \"Take him away, Dad. He\u0027ll frighten the fish,\" Sam said crossly.\n Silas tiptoed off with Nicko and went to sit beside his oldest son, Simon. Simon had a fishing rod in one hand and a book in the other. It was Simon\u0027s ambition to be the ExtraOrdinary Wizard, and he was busy reading all of Silas\u0027s old magic books. This one, Silas noticed, was called The Compleat Fish-Charmer.\n Silas expected all his boys to be some kind of Wizard; it was in the family. Silas\u0027s aunt was a renowned White Witch and both Silas\u0027s father and uncle had been Shape-Shifters, which was a very specialized branch, and one that Silas hoped his boys would avoid, for successful Shape-Shifters became increasingly unstable as they grew older, sometimes unable to hold their own shape for more than a few minutes at a time. Silas\u0027s father had eventually disappeared into the Forest as a tree, but no one knew which one. It was one of the reasons why Silas enjoyed his walks through the Forest. He would often address a remark to an untidy-looking tree in the hope that it might be his father.\n Sarah Heap came from a Warlock and Wizard family. As a girl, Sarah had studied herbs and healing with Galen, the Physik Woman in the Forest, which was where she had met Silas one day. Silas had been out looking for his father. He was lost and unhappy, and Sarah took him back with her to see Galen. Galen had helped Silas to understand that his father, as a Shape-Shifter, would have chosen his final destination as a tree many years ago and would now be truly happy. And Silas too, for the first time in his life, realized he felt truly happy sitting next to Sarah by the Physik Woman\u0027s fire.\n When Sarah understood all she could about herbs and healing, she had said a fond good-bye to Galen and joined Silas in his room in The Ramblings. And there they had stayed ever since, squeezing in more and more children while Silas happily gave up his Apprenticeship and worked as a jobbing Ordinary Wizard to pay the bills. Sarah made herb tinctures at the kitchen table when she had a spare moment - which did not often happen.\n That evening, as Silas and the boys made their way up the beach steps to go back to The Ramblings, a large and menacing Custodian Guard, dressed in black from head to toe, barred their way. \"Halt!\" he barked. Nicko started to cry.\n Silas stopped and told the boys to behave.\n \"Papers!\" shouted the Guard. \"Where are your papers?\"\n Silas stared at him. \"What papers?\" he asked quietly, not wanting to cause trouble with six tired boys around him needing to go home for supper.\n \"Your papers, Wizard scum. The beach area is forbidden to all without the required papers,\" sneered the Guard.\n Silas was shocked. If he had not been with the boys, he would have argued, but he had noticed the pistol that the guard was carrying.\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said. \"I didn\u0027t know.\"\n The Guard looked them all up and down as if deciding what to do, but luckily for Silas he had other people to go and terrorize. \"Take your rabble out of here and don\u0027t come back,\" snapped the Guard. \"Stay where you belong.\"\n Silas hurried the shocked boys away up the steps and into the safety of The Ramblings. Sam dropped his fish and started to sob.\n \"There there,\" said Silas, \"it\u0027s all right.\" But Silas felt that things were most certainly not all right. What was going on?\n \"Why did he call us Wizard scum, Dad?\" asked Simon. \"Wizards are the best, aren\u0027t they?\"\n \"Yes,\" said Silas distractedly, \"the best.\"\n But the trouble was, thought Silas, there was no hiding it if you were a Wizard. All Wizards, and only Wizards, had them. Silas had them, Sarah had them and all the boys except Nicko and Jo-Jo had them. And as soon as Nicko and Jo-Jo went to the Magyk class in school they would have them too. Slowly but surely, until there was no mistaking it, a Wizard child\u0027s eyes would turn green when he or she was exposed to Magyk learning. It had always been something to be proud of. Until now, when suddenly it felt dangerous.\n That evening, when at long last all the children were asleep, Silas and Sarah talked late into the night. They talked about their Princess and their Wizard boys and the changes that had overtaken the Castle. They discussed escaping to the Marram Marshes, or going into the Forest and living with Galen. By the time dawn broke and at last they fell asleep, Silas and Sarah had decided to do what the Heaps usually did. Muddle through and hope for the best.\n And so, for the next nine and a half years, Silas and Sarah kept quiet. They locked and barred their door, they spoke to only their neighbors and those they could trust and, when the Magyk classes were stopped at school, they taught the children Magyk at home in the evenings.\n And that is why, nine and a half years later, all the Heaps except one had piercing green eyes. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/magyk-septimus-heap-1/page-2.html","bookId":2704,"book":{"id":2704,"title":"Magyk (Septimus Heap #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Magyk (Septimus Heap #1) \n The seventh son of the seventh son, aptly named Septimus Heap, is stolen the night he is born by a midwife who pronounces him dead.
