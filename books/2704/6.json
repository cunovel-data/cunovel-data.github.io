She hardly had time to kiss everyone goodbye before Marcia had thrown her purple cloak over her and told her to stay close and keep up. Then the big black Heap door had unwillingly creaked itself open, and Jenna was whisked away from the only home she had ever known.\n It was probably a good thing that, covered as she was by Marcia\u0027s cloak, Jenna could not see the bewildered faces of the six Heap boys or the desolate expressions on the faces of Sarah and Silas Heap as they watched the four-legged purple cloak swish around the corner at the end of Corridor 223 and disappear from view.\n Marcia and Jenna took the long way back to the WizardTower. Marcia did not want to risk being seen outside with Jenna, and the dark winding corridors of the East Side seemed safer than the quick route she had taken earlier that morning. Marcia strode briskly along, and Jenna had to run beside her to have any hope of keeping up. Luckily all she carried with her was a small rucksack on her back with a few treasures to remind her of home; although, in the rush she had forgotten her birthday present.\n It was midmorning by now and the rush hour was over. Much to Marcia\u0027s relief the damp corridors were almost deserted as she and Jenna traveled quietly along them, fluently taking each turn as Marcia\u0027s memory of her old trips to the WizardTower came back to her.\n Hidden under Marcia\u0027s heavy cloak, Jenna could see very little, so she concentrated her gaze on the two pairs of feet below her: her own small, chunky feet in their scruffy brown boots and Marcia\u0027s long, pointy feet in their purple python skins striding over the dank gray slabs beneath them. Soon Jenna had stopped noticing her own boots and had become mesmerized by the purple pointed pythons dancing before her - left, right, left, right, left, right - as they crossed the miles of endless passageways.\n In this way the strange pair moved unnoticed through the Castle. Past the heavy murmuring doors that hid the many workshops where the people from the East Side spent their long working hours making boots, beer, clothes, boats, beds, saddles, candles, sails, bread, and more recently guns, uniforms and chains. Past the cold schoolrooms where bored children chanted their thirteen times-tables and past the empty, echoing storerooms where the Custodian Army had recently taken away most of the winter stores for its own use.\n At long last Marcia and Jenna emerged through the narrow archway that led into the WizardTower courtyard. Jenna caught her breath in the cold air and stole a look out from under the cloak. She gasped.\n Rearing up in front of her was the WizardTower, so high that the golden Pyramid crowning it was almost lost in a wisp of Iow-lying cloud. The Tower shone a brilliant silver in the winter sunlight, so bright that it hurt Jenna\u0027s eyes, and the purple glass in its hundreds of tiny windows glittered and sparkled with a mysterious darkness that reflected the light and kept the secrets hidden behind them. A thin blue haze shimmered around the Tower, blurring its boundaries, and Jenna found it hard to tell where the Tower ended and the sky began. The air too was different; it smelled strange and sweet, of magical spells and old incense. And as Jenna stood, unable to stir another step, she knew that she was surrounded by the sounds, too soft to be heard, of ancient charms and incantations.\n For the first time since Jenna had left her home she was afraid.\n Marcia put a protective arm around Jenna\u0027s shoulders, for even Marcia remembered what it was like to first see the Tower. Terrifying.\n \"Come on, nearly there,\" murmured Marcia encouragingly, and together they slipped and slid across the snow-covered courtyard toward the huge marble steps that led up to the shimmering, silver entrance. Marcia was intent upon keeping her balance, and it was not until she reached the bottom of the steps that she noticed there was no longer a sentry on guard. She looked at her timepiece, puzzled. The sentry change was not due for fifteen minutes, so where was the snowball-throwing boy she had told off that morning?\n Marcia looked around, tutting to herself. Something was wrong. The sentry was not here. And yet he was still here. He was, she suddenly realized, between the Here and the Not Here.\n He was nearly dead.\n Marcia made a sudden dive toward a small mound by the archway, and Jenna fell out of the cloak.\n \"Dig!\" hissed Marcia, scrabbling away at the mound. \"He\u0027s here. Frozen.\"\n Underneath the mound lay the thin white body of the sentry. He was curled up into a ball, and his flimsy cotton uniform was soaked with the snow and clung coldly to him, the acid-bright colors of the bizarre uniform looking tawdry in the cold winter sunlight. Jenna shivered at the sight of the boy, not from the cold but from an unknown, wordless memory that had flitted across her mind.\n Marcia carefully brushed the snow from the boy\u0027s dark blue mouth while Jenna lay her hand on his white sticklike arm. She had never felt anyone so cold before. Surely he was already dead?\n Jenna watched Marcia lean over the boy\u0027s face and mutter something under her breath. Marcia stopped, listened and looked concerned. Then she muttered again, more urgently this time, \"Quicken, Youngling. Quicken.\" She paused for a moment and then breathed a long slow breath over the boy\u0027s face. The breath tumbled endlessly from Marcia\u0027s mouth, on and on, a warm pale pink cloud that enveloped the boy\u0027s mouth and nose and slowly, slowly seemed to take away the awful blue and replace it with a living glow. The boy did not stir, but Jenna thought that now she could see a faint rise and fall of his chest. He was breathing again.\n \"Quick!\" whispered Marcia to Jenna. \"He won\u0027t survive if we leave him here. We\u0027ll have to get him inside.\" Marcia gathered the boy into her arms and carried him up the wide marble steps. As she reached the top, the solid silver doors to the WizardTower swung silently open before them. Jenna took a deep breath and followed Marcia and the boy inside. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/magyk-septimus-heap-1/page-6.html","bookId":2704,"book":{"id":2704,"title":"Magyk (Septimus Heap #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Magyk (Septimus Heap #1) \n The seventh son of the seventh son, aptly named Septimus Heap, is stolen the night he is born by a midwife who pronounces him dead.
