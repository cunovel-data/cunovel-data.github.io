{"id":73566,"no":37,"title":"Page 37","content":"The Appointment\n Later that night the Apprentice escaped through the cat tunnel.\n Bert, who still had all the instincts of a cat, liked to go wandering at night, and Aunt Zelda would leave the door on a one-way CharmLock. This allowed Bert to go out, but nothing to come in. Not even Bert. Aunt Zelda was very careful about stray Brownies and Marsh Wraiths.\n So, when everyone except for the Apprentice had fallen asleep and Bert had decided to go out for the night, the Apprentice thought that he would follow her. It was a tight squeeze, but the Apprentice, who was as thin as a snake and twice as wriggly, wormed his way through the narrow space. As he did so, the Darke Magyk which clung to his robes DisEnchanted the cat tunnel. Soon his flustered face emerged from the tunnel into the chill night air.\n Bert met him with a sharp peck on the nose, but the Apprentice was not deterred. He was much more scared of getting stuck in the cat tunnel, with his feet still inside the house and his head on the outside, than he was of Bert. He had a feeling that no one would be in much of a hurry to pull him out if he did get stuck. So he ignored the angry duck and, with a huge effort, wriggled free.\n The Apprentice made straight for the landing stage, closely pursued by Bert, who tried to grab his collar again, but this time the Apprentice was ready for her. Angrily, he swatted her away, sending her crashing to the ground and badly bruising a wing.\n The Magog was lying full length in the canoe, sleeping while it digested all fifty-six Shield Bugs. The Apprentice warily stepped over it. To his relief the creature did not stir - digestion was something a Magog took very seriously. The smell of Magog slime caught in the back of the Apprentice\u0027s throat, but he picked up the slime-covered paddle and was soon away down the Mott, heading out toward the maze of winding channels that crisscrossed the Marram Marshes and would take him to the Deppen Ditch.\n As he left the cottage behind and traveled into the wide moonlit expanse of the marshes, the Apprentice began to feel a little uneasy. With the Magog sleeping, the Apprentice felt horribly unprotected and he remembered all the terrifying stories he had heard about the marshes at night. He paddled the canoe as quietly as he was able to, afraid of disturbing something that may not want to be disturbed. Or, even worse, something that might be waiting to be disturbed. All around him he could hear the nighttime noises of the marsh. He heard the muffled underground shrieking of a pack of Brownies as they pulled an unsuspecting Marsh Cat down into the Quake Ooze. And then there was a nasty scrabbling and squelching noise as two large Water Nixies tried to clamp their sucker pads onto the bottom of the canoe and chew their way into it, but they slipped off soon enough thanks to the remnants of the Magog\u0027s slime.\n Sometime after the Water Nixies had dropped off, a Marsh Moaner appeared. Although it was only a small wisp of white mist, it gave off a dank smell that reminded the Apprentice of the burrow in DomDaniel\u0027s hideout. The Marsh Moaner sat itself down behind the Apprentice and started tunelessly singing the most mournful and irritating song the Apprentice had ever heard. The tune whirled around and around inside his head - \"Weerrghh-derr\u0027waaaaah-dooooooooo ... Weerrghh-derr-waaaah-dooooooooo ... Weerrghh-derr-waaaah-dooooooooo...\" - until the Apprentice felt he might go mad.\n He tried to bat the Moaner away with his paddle, but it went straight through the wailing scrap of mist, unbalanced the canoe and nearly sent the Apprentice tumbling out into the dark water. And still the awful tune went on, a little mockingly now that the Moaner knew it had the Apprentice\u0027s attention: \"Weerrghh-derr-waaaah-dooooooooo ... Weerghh-derr-waaaah-doooooooo ... oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...\"\n \"Stop it!\" yelled the Apprentice, unable to stand the noise a moment longer. He stuffed his fingers into his ears and started singing in a voice loud enough to shut out the ghastly tune. \"I\u0027m not listening, I\u0027m not listening, I\u0027m not listening,\" the Apprentice chanted at the top of his lungs while the triumphant Moaner swirled around the canoe, pleased with its night\u0027s work. It usually took the Marsh Moaner much longer to reduce a Young One to a gibbering wreck, but tonight it had struck lucky. Mission completed, the Marsh Moaner flattened out into a thin sheet of mist and wafted off to spend the rest of the night contentedly hanging above its favorite bog.\n The Apprentice paddled doggedly on, no longer caring about the succession of Marsh Wraiths, Bogle Bugs and a very tempting array of Marshfire that danced about his canoe for hours. By then the Apprentice did not mind what anything did, as long as it didn\u0027t sing.\n As the sun rose over the far reaches of the Marram Marshes, the Apprentice realized he had become hopelessly lost. He was in the middle of a featureless expanse of marshland that all looked the same to him. He paddled wearily onward, not knowing what else to do, and it was midday before he reached a wide, straight stretch of water that looked as though it actually went somewhere, rather than petering out into yet another soggy morass. Exhausted, the Apprentice turned into what was the upper reaches of the Deppen Ditch and slowly headed toward the river. His discovery of the giant Marsh Python, lurking at the bottom of the Ditch and trying to straighten itself out, hardly even bothered the Apprentice. He was far too tired to care. He was also very determined. He had an appointment with DomDaniel, and this time he wasn\u0027t going to mess things up. Very soon the Queenling would be sorry. They would all be sorry. Particularly the duck.\n That morning, back at the cottage, no one could believe that the Apprentice had managed to squeeze out through the cat tunnel.\n \"I\u0027d have thought his head was too big to fit through it,\" Jenna said scornfully.\n Nicko went out to search the island, but he was soon back again. \"The Hunter\u0027s canoe is gone,\" he said, \"and that was a fast boat. He\u0027ll be far away by now.\"\n \"We\u0027ve got to stop him,\" said Boy 412, who knew only too well just how dangerous a boy like the Apprentice could be, \"before he tells anyone where we are, which he will do as soon as he can.\"\n And so Jenna, Nicko and Boy 412 took Muriel Two and set off in pursuit of the Apprentice. As the pale spring sun rose over the Marram Marshes, sending long glancing shadows across the mires and bogs, the ungainly Muriel Two took them through the maze of cuts and ditches. She traveled slow and steady, far too slow for Nicko, who knew how quickly the Hunter\u0027s canoe must have covered the same distance. Nicko kept a watchful eye out for any sign of the sleek black canoe, half expecting to see it upturned in a Brownie Quake Ooze or drifting empty along a ditch, but to his disappointment he saw nothing apart from a long black log that only momentarily raised his hopes.\n They stopped for a while to eat some goat cheese and sardine sandwiches beside the Marsh Moaners\u0027 bog. But they were left in peace as the Moaners were long gone, evaporated in the warmth of the rising sun.\n It was early afternoon and a gray drizzle had set in when, at last, they paddled into the Deppen Ditch. The Marsh Python lay dozing in the mud, half covered with the sluggish water of the recently turned incoming tide. It ignored Muriel Two, much to the occupants\u0027 relief, and lay waiting for the fresh influx of fish that the rising tide would bring. The tide was very low, and the canoe sat well below the steep banks that rose up on either side of them, so it was not until they rounded the very last bend of the Deppen Ditch that Jenna, Nicko and Boy 412 saw what was waiting for them.\n The Vengeance.\n The Meeting\n A shocked silence fell in the Muriel Two canoe. Just a short paddle away, the Vengeance lay quietly at anchor in the early afternoon drizzle, still and steady in the middle of the river\u0027s deepwater channel. The massive black ship was a striking sight: its bow rose up like the steep side of a cliff, and with its tattered black sails furled, its two tall masts stood out like black bones against the overcast sky. An oppressive silence surrounded the ship in the gray light. No seagulls dared wheel around hoping for scraps. Small boats using the river saw the ship and hurried quietly along the shallow waters by the riverbank, more willing to risk running aground than to go near the notorious Vengeance. A heavy black cloud had formed above the masts, casting a dark shadow over the entire ship, and from the stern a blood-red flag with a line of three black stars fluttered ominously.\n Nicko did not need the flag to tell him whose ship it was. No other ship had ever been painted with the strong black tar that DomDaniel used, and no other ship could have been surrounded by such a malevolent atmosphere. He gestured frantically to Jenna and Boy 412 to paddle backward, and a moment later Muriel Two was safely hidden behind the last bend of Deppen Ditch.\n \"What is it?\" whispered Jenna.\n \"It\u0027s the Vengeance,\" whispered Nicko. \"DomDaniel\u0027s ship. I reckon it\u0027s waiting for the Apprentice. I bet that\u0027s where the little toad has gone. Pass me the eyeglass, Jen.\"\n Nicko put the telescope to his eye and saw exactly what he had feared. There in the deep shadows cast by the steep black sides of the hull was the Hunter\u0027s canoe. It lay bobbing in the water, empty and dwarfed by the bulk of the Vengeance, tied to the foot of a long rope ladder that led up to the ship\u0027s deck. The Apprentice had kept his appointment.\n \"It\u0027s too late,\" said Nicko. \"He\u0027s there. Oh, yuck, what\u0027s that? Oh, disgusting. That Thing\u0027s just slipped out from inside the canoe. It\u0027s so slimy. But it can certainly get up a rope ladder. It\u0027s like some gruesome monkey.\" Nicko shuddered.\n \"Can you see the Apprentice?\" whispered Jenna.\n Nicko swept the eyeglass up the rope ladder. He nodded. Sure enough, the Apprentice had almost reached the top, but he had stopped and was staring down in horror at the rapidly climbing Thing. In a matter of moments the Magog had reached the Apprentice and scuttled over him, leaving a trail of vivid yellow slime across the back of his robes. The Apprentice seemed to falter for a moment and almost loosen his grip on the ladder, but he struggled up the last few rungs and collapsed on the deck, where he lay unnoticed for some time.\n Serves him right, thought Nicko.\n They decided to take a closer look at the Vengeance on foot. They tied Muriel Two to a rock and walked along to the beach where they had had the midnight picnic the night of their escape from the Castle. As they rounded the bend Jenna got a shock. Someone was already there. She stopped dead and ducked back behind an old tree trunk. Boy 412 and Nicko bumped into her.\n \"What is it?\" whispered Nicko.\n \"There\u0027s someone on the beach,\" whispered Jenna. \"Maybe it\u0027s someone from the ship. Keeping guard.\"\n Nicko peered around the tree trunk. \"It\u0027s not someone from the ship.\" He smiled.\n \"How do you know?\" asked Jenna. \"It could be.\"\n \"Because it\u0027s Alther.\"\n Alther Mella was sitting on the beach, staring mournfully out into the drizzle. He had been there for days, hoping that someone from Keeper\u0027s Cottage would turn up. He needed to talk to them urgently.\n \"Alther?\" whispered Jenna.\n \"Princess!\" Alther\u0027s careworn face lit up. He wafted over to Jenna and enfolded her in a warm hug. \"Well, I do believe you\u0027ve grown since I last saw you.\"\n Jenna put her fingers to her lips. \"Shhh, they might hear us, Alther,\" she said.\n Alther looked surprised. He wasn\u0027t used to Jenna telling him what to do.\n \"They can\u0027t hear me.\" He chuckled. \"Not unless I want them to. And they can\u0027t hear you either - I\u0027ve put up a Scream Screen, they won\u0027t hear a thing.\"\n \"Oh, Alther,\" said Jenna. \"It is so lovely to see you. Isn\u0027t it, Nicko?\"\n Nicko had a big grin on his face. \"It\u0027s great,\" he said.\n Alther gave Boy 412 a quizzical look. \"Here\u0027s someone else who\u0027s grown too.\" He smiled. \"Those Young Army lads are always so painfully thin. It\u0027s nice to see you\u0027ve filled out a bit. \"\n Boy 412 blushed.\n \"He\u0027s nice now too, Uncle Alther,\" Jenna told the ghost.\n \"I expect he was always nice, Princess,\" said Alther. \"But you\u0027re not allowed to be nice in the Young Army. It\u0027s forbidden.\" He smiled at Boy 412.\n Boy 412 smiled shyly back.\n They sat on the drizzly beach, just out of sight of the Vengeance.\n \"How\u0027s Mum and Dad?\" asked Nicko.\n \"And Simon?\" asked Jenna. \"What about Simon?\"\n \"Ah, Simon,\" said Alther. \"Simon had deliberately slipped away from Sarah in the Forest. Seems he and Lucy Cringe had planned to secretly get married.\"\n \"What?\" said Nicko. \"Simon got married?\"\n \"No. Cringe found out and shopped him to the Custodian Guards.\"\n \"Oh, no!\" gasped Jenna and Nicko.\n \"Oh, don\u0027t worry yourselves about Simon,\" said Alther, strangely unsympathetic. \"How he managed to spend all that time in the custody of the Supreme Custodian and come out looking like he\u0027d had a holiday, I don\u0027t know. Although I have my suspicions.\"\n \"How do you mean, Uncle Alther?\" asked Jenna.\n \"Oh, it\u0027s probably nothing, Princess.\" Alther seemed unwilling to say any more about Simon.\n There was something Boy 412 wanted to ask but it felt odd talking to a ghost. But he had to ask, so he plucked up his courage and said, \"Er, excuse me, but what\u0027s happened to Marcia? Is she all right?\"\n Alther sighed. \"No,\" he said.\n \"No?\" three voices asked at once.\n \"She was set up,\" Alther frowned. \"Set up by the Supreme Custodian and the Rat Office. He\u0027s put his own rats in. Or rather DomDaniel\u0027s rats. And a vicious lot they are too. They used to run the spy network back at DomDaniel\u0027s place in the Badlands. They\u0027ve got a very nasty reputation. Came in with the plague rats hundreds of years ago. Not nice.\"\n \"You mean our Message Rat was one of them?\" asked Jenna, thinking of how she had rather liked him.\n \"No, no. He got marched off by the Rat Office heavies. He\u0027s disappeared. Poor rat. I wouldn\u0027t give much for his chances,\" said Alther.\n \"Oh. That\u0027s awful,\" said Jenna.\n \"And the message for Marcia wasn\u0027t from Silas either,\" said Alther.\n \"I didn\u0027t think it was,\" said Nicko.\n \"It was from the Supreme Custodian,\" Alther said. \"So when Marcia turned up at the Palace Gate to meet Silas, the Custodian Guards were waiting for her. Of course that wouldn\u0027t have been a problem for Marcia if she had got her Midnight Minutes right, but her timepiece was twenty minutes slow. And she\u0027d given away her KeepSafe. It\u0027s a bad business. DomDaniel has taken the Amulet, so I am afraid he\u0027s now ... the ExtraOrdinary Wizard.\"\n Jenna and Nicko were speechless. This was worse than anything they had feared.\n cuse me,\" ventured Boy 412,, who felt terrible. It was his fault. If he had been her Apprentice then he could have helped her. This never would have happened. \"Marcia is still ... alive, isn\u0027t she?\"\n Alther looked at Boy 412. His faded green eyes had a kindly expression as, using his unsettling habit of reading people\u0027s minds, he said, \"You couldn\u0027t have done anything, lad. They would have got you too. She was in Dungeon Number One, but now - \"\n Boy 412 put his head in his hands in despair. He knew all about Dungeon Number One.\n Alther put a ghostly arm around his shoulder. \"Don\u0027t fret now,\" he told him. \"I was with her for most of the time and she was doing all right. Kept going pretty well, I thought. All things considered. A few days ago I just popped out to check on various little ... projects I have going on in DomDaniel\u0027s rooms at the Tower. When I got back to the dungeon she was gone. I\u0027ve looked everywhere I can. I even have some of the Ancients looking. You know, the really old ghosts. But they\u0027re very faded and easily confused. Most of them don\u0027t know their way around the Castle very well anymore - they come up against a new wall or staircase and they\u0027re stuck. They can\u0027t work it out. I had to go and get one out of the kitchen midden yesterday. Apparently it used to be the Wizard\u0027s refectory. About five hundred years ago. Frankly the Ancients, sweet as they are, are more trouble than they are worth.\" Alther sighed. \"Although I do wonder if...\"\n \"If what?\" asked Jenna.\n \"If she might be on the Vengeance. Unfortunately I can\u0027t get on the wretched ship to find out.\"\n Alther was cross with himself. He would now advise any ExtraOrdinary Wizard to go to as many places as they could in their lifetime so that as a ghost they were not as thwarted as he had been. But it was too late for Alther to change what he had done while he was alive; he had to make the best of it now.\n At least, when he was first appointed Apprentice, DomDaniel had insisted on taking Alther on a long and very unpleasant tour of the deepest dungeons. At the time Alther had never dreamed that one day he might come to be glad of it, but if only he had accepted an invitation to the launching party on the Vengeance ... Alther remembered how, as one of some promising young potential Apprentices, he had been invited to a party on board DomDaniel\u0027s boat. Alther had turned down the invitation on account of the fact it was Alice Nettles\u0027s birthday. No women were allowed on the ship, and Alther was certainly not going to leave Alice alone on her birthday. At the party, the potential Apprentices had run riot and caused a great deal of damage to the ship, thus ensuring that they had no hope of being offered as much as a cleaning job with the ExtraOrdinary Wizard. Not long afterward Alther was offered the ExtraOrdinary Wizard Apprenticeship. Alther had never got the chance to visit the ship again. After the disastrous party, DomDaniel took her up to Bleak Creek for a refit. Bleak Creek was an eerie anchorage full of abandoned and rotting ships. The Necromancer had liked it so much that he left his ship there and visited every year for his summer holiday.\n The subdued group sat on the damp beach. They gloomily ate the last of the damp goat cheese and sardine sandwiches and drank the dregs from the flask of beetroot and carrot cordial.\n \"There are some times,\" said Alther reflectively, \"when I really miss not being able to eat anymore...\"\n \"But this isn\u0027t one of them?\" Jenna finished for him.\n \"Spot on, Princess.\"\n Jenna fished Petroc Trelawney out of her pocket and offered him a sticky mix of squashed sardine and goat cheese. Petroc opened his eyes and looked at the offering. The pet rock was surprised. This was the kind of food he usually got from Boy 412; Jenna always gave him biscuits. But he ate it anyway, apart from a piece of goat cheese that stuck to his head and then later to the inside of Jenna\u0027s pocket.\n When they had finished chewing the last of the soggy sandwiches, Alther said seriously, \"Now, down to business.\"\n Three worried faces looked at the ghost.\n \"Listen to me, all of you. You must go straight back to Keeper\u0027s Cottage. I want you to tell Zelda to take you all to the Port first thing tomorrow morning. Alice - she is Chief Customs Officer down there now - is finding you a ship. You are to go to the Far Countries while I try and sort things out here.\"\n \"But - \" gasped Jenna, Nicko and Boy 412.\n Alther ignored their protest. \"I will meet you all at the Blue Anchor Tavern on the Harbor tomorrow morning. You must be there. Your mother and father are coming too, along with Simon. They are on their way down the river in my old boat, Molly. I am afraid that Sam, Erik and Edd and Jojo have refused to leave the Forest - they have gone quite wild, but Morwenna will keep an eye on them.\"\n There was an unhappy silence. No one liked what Alther had said.\n \"That\u0027s running away,\" Jenna said quietly. \"We want to stay. And fight.\"\n \"I knew you\u0027d say that,\" sighed Alther. \"It is just what your mother would have said. But you must go now.\"\n Nicko stood up. \"All right,\" he said reluctantly. \"We\u0027ll see you tomorrow at the Port.\"\n \"Good,\" said Alther. \"Now, be careful and I\u0027ll see you all tomorrow.\" He floated up and watched the three of them trail disconsolately back to the Muriel Two. Alther stayed watching until he was satisfied that they were making good progress along the Deppen Ditch and then he sped off along the river, flying low and fast, off to join Molly. Soon he was just a small speck in the distance.\n Which was when the Muriel Two turned around and headed straight back toward the Vengeance. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/magyk-septimus-heap-1/page-37.html","bookId":2704,"book":{"id":2704,"title":"Magyk (Septimus Heap #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Magyk (Septimus Heap #1) \n The seventh son of the seventh son, aptly named Septimus Heap, is stolen the night he is born by a midwife who pronounces him dead.
