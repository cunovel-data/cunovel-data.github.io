Jenna wrested the paddle away and was about to hit the slimy brown thing with it - hard - when a voice said, \"Oi. No need fer that.\" A seallike creature covered in slippery brown fur pulled itself up so that its head was just out of the water. Two bright black-button eyes stared at Jenna, who had her paddle still poised in midair. \"Wish you\u0027d put that down. Could hurt someone. So where you bin, then?\" the creature asked grumpily in a deep, gurgling voice with a broad marshland drawl. \"I bin waitin\u0027 for hours. Freezin\u0027 in here. How\u0027dj\u0027ou like it? Stuck in a ditch. Just waitin\u0027 \" All Jenna could manage in reply was a small squeak; her voice seemed to have stopped working. \"What is it, Jen?\" asked Nicko, who was sitting behind Boy 412, just to make sure he didn\u0027t do anything stupid, and couldn\u0027t see the creature. \"Th - this...\" Jenna pointed at the creature, who looked offended. \"What you mean this?\" he asked. \"You mean me? You mean Boggart?\" \"Boggart? No. I didn\u0027t say that,\" muttered Jenna. \"Well I did. Boggart. That\u0027s me. I\u0027m Boggart. Boggart, the Boggart. Good name, innit?\" \"Lovely,\" said Jenna politely. \"What\u0027s going on?\" asked Silas, catching up with them. \"Stoppit, Maxie. Stoppit I say!\" Maxie had caught sight of the Boggart and was barking frantically. The Boggart took one look at Maxie and disappeared back under the water. Since the notorious Boggart Hunts many years ago in which Maxie\u0027s ancestors had taken part so effectively, the Marram Marsh Boggart had become a rare creature. With a long memory. The Boggart reappeared at a safe distance. \"You\u0027re not bringin\u0027 that?\" he said, looking balefully at Maxie. \"She didunt say nothin\u0027 \u0027bout one a them.\" \"Do I hear a Boggart?\" asked Silas. \"Yeah,\" said the Boggart. \"Zelda\u0027s Boggart?\" \"Yeah,\" said the Boggart. \"Has she sent you to find us?\" \"Yeah,\" said the Boggart. \"Good,\" said Silas, very relieved. \"We\u0027ll follow you, then.\" \"Yeah,\" said the Boggart, and he swam off along Deppen Ditch and took the next turning but one. The next turning but one was much narrower than the Deppen Ditch and wound its snakelike way deep into the moonlit, snow-covered marshes. The snow fell steadily and all was quiet and still, apart from the gurgles and splashes of the Boggart as he swam in front of the canoes, every now and then sticking his head out of the dark water and calling out, \"You followin\u0027?\" \"I don\u0027t know what else he thinks we can do,\" Jenna said to Nicko as they paddled the canoe along the increasingly narrow ditch. \"It\u0027s not as if there\u0027s anywhere else to go.\" But the Boggart took his duties seriously and kept going with the same question until they reached a small marsh pool with several overgrown channels leading off it. \"Best wait for the others,\" said the Boggart. \"Don\u0027t want \u0027em gettin\u0027 lost.\" Jenna glanced back to see where Marcia and Silas had got to. They were far behind now, as Silas was the only one paddling. Marcia had given up and had both hands clamped firmly to the top of her head. Behind her the long and pointy snout of an Abyssinian wolfhound loftily surveyed the scene before him and let drop the occasional long strand of glistening dribble. Straight onto Marcia\u0027s head. As Silas propelled the canoe into the pool and wearily laid his paddle down, Marcia declared, \"I am not sitting in front of that animal one moment longer. There\u0027s dog dribble all over my hair. It\u0027s disgusting. I\u0027m getting out. I\u0027d rather walk.\" \"You don\u0027t wanter be doin\u0027 that, Yer Majesty,\" came the Boggart\u0027s voice from out of the water beside Marcia. He gazed up at Marcia, his bright black eyes blinking through his brown fur, amazed by her ExtraOrdinary Wizard belt that glinted in the moonlight. Although he was a creature of the marsh mud, the Boggart loved bright and shiny things. And he had never seen such a bright and shiny thing as Marcia\u0027s gold and platinum belt. \"You don\u0027t wanter be walkin\u0027 round \u0027ere, Yer Majesty,\" the Boggart told her respectfully. \"You\u0027ll start followin\u0027 the Marshfire, and it\u0027ll lead you into the Quake Ooze before you know it. There\u0027s many as has followed the Marshfire and there\u0027s none as has returned.\" A rumbling growl was coming from deep down in Maxie\u0027s throat. The fur on the back of his neck stood up, and suddenly, obeying an old and compelling wolfhound instinct, Maxie leaped into the water after the Boggart. \"Maxie! Maxie! Oh, you stupid dog,\" yelled Silas. The water in the pool was freezing. Maxie yelped and frantically dog-paddled back to Silas\u0027s and Marcia\u0027s canoe. Marcia shoved him away. \"That dog is not getting back in here,\" she announced. \"Marcia, he\u0027ll freeze,\" protested Silas. \"I don t care.\" \"Here, Maxie. C\u0027mon boy,\" said Nicko. He grabbed Maxie\u0027s neckerchief and, with Jenna\u0027s help, hauled the dog into their canoe. The canoe tipped dangerously, but Boy 412, who had no desire to end up in the water like Maxie, steadied it by grabbing hold of a tree root. Maxie stood shivering for a moment, then he did what any wet dog has to do: he shook himself. \"Maxie!\" gasped Nicko and Jenna. Boy 412 said nothing. He didn\u0027t like dogs at all. The only dogs he had ever known were the vicious Custodian Guard Dogs, and although he could see that Maxie looked nothing like them, he still expected him to bite at any moment. And so when Maxie settled down, laid his head on Boy 412\u0027s lap and went to sleep, it was just another very bad moment in Boy 412\u0027s worst day ever. But Maxie was happy. Boy 412\u0027s sheepskin jacket was warm and comfortable, and the wolfhound spent the rest of the journey dreaming that he was back at home curled up in front of the fire with all the other Heaps. But the Boggart had gone. \"Boggart? Where are you, Mr. Boggart?\" Jenna called out politely. There was no reply. Just the deep silence that comes to the marshes when a blanket of snow covers the bogs and quags, silences their gurgles and gloops and sends all the slimy creatures back into the stillness of the mud. \"Now we\u0027ve lost that nice Boggart because of your stupid animal,\" Marcia told Silas crossly. \"I don\u0027t know why you had to bring him.\" Silas sighed. Sharing a canoe with Marcia Overstrand was not something he had ever imagined he would have to do. But if he had, in a mad moment, ever imagined it, this was exactly how it would have been. Silas scanned the horizon in the hope that he might be able to see Keeper\u0027s Cottage, where Aunt Zelda lived. The cottage stood on DraggenIsland, one of the many islands in the marsh, which became true islands only when the marsh-land flooded. But all Silas could see was white flatness stretching out before him in all directions. To make matters worse, he could see the marsh mist beginning to rise up and drift across the water, and he knew that if the mist came in they would never see Keeper\u0027s Cottage, however close they might be to it. Then he remembered that the cottage was Enchanted. Which meant that no one could see it anyway. If they ever needed the Boggart, it was now. \"I can see a light!\" said Jenna, suddenly. \"It must be Aunt Zelda coming to look for us. Look, over there!\" All eyes followed Jenna\u0027s pointing finger. A flickering light was jumping over the marshes, as if bounding from tussock to tussock. \"She\u0027s coming toward us,\" said Jenna, excited. \"No, she\u0027s not,\" Nicko said. \"Look, she\u0027s going away.\" \"Perhaps we ought to go and meet her,\" said Silas. Marcia was not convinced. \"How can you be sure it\u0027s Zelda?\" she said. \"It could be anyone. Anything.\" Everyone fell silent at the thought of a thing with a light coming toward them, until Silas said, \"It is Zelda. Look, I can see her.\" \"No, you can\u0027t,\" said Marcia. \"It\u0027s Marshfire, like that very intelligent Boggart said.\" \"Marcia, I know Zelda when I see her, and I can see her now. She\u0027s carrying a light. She\u0027s come all this way to find us and we are just sitting here. I\u0027m going to meet her.\" \"They say that fools see what they want to see in Marshfire,\" said Marcia tartly, \"and you\u0027ve just proved that saying true, Silas.\" Silas made to get out of the canoe, and Marcia grabbed his cloak. \"Sit!\" she said as though she was talking to Maxie. But Silas pulled away, half in a dream, drawn to the flickering light and the shadow of Aunt Zelda that appeared and disappeared through the rising mist. Sometimes she was tantalizingly near, about to find them all and lead them to a warm fire and a soft bed, sometimes fading away sorrowfully and inviting them to follow and be with her. But Silas could no longer bear to be away from the light. He climbed out of the canoe and stumbled off toward the flickering glow. \"Dad!\" yelled Jenna. \"Can we come too?\" \"No, you may not,\" said Marcia firmly. \"And I\u0027m going to have to bring the silly old fool back.\" Marcia was just drawing breath for the Boomerang Spell when Silas tripped and fell headlong onto the boggy ground. As he lay winded, Silas felt the marsh beneath him begin to shift as though living things were stirring in the depths of the mud. And when he tried to get up, Silas found that he could not. It was as if he were glued to the ground. In his Marshfire daze, Silas was confused about why he seemed unable to move. He tried to lift his head to see what was happening but was unable to. It was then that he realized the awful truth: something was pulling at his hair. Silas raised his hands to his head, and to his horror, he could feel little bony fingers in his hair, winding and knotting his long straggling curls around them and pulling, tugging him down into the bog. Desperately Silas struggled to get free, but the more he struggled, the more the fingers tangled the boggart themselves up in his hair. Slowly and steadily they pulled Silas down until the mud covered his eyes and soon, very soon, would cover his nose. Marcia could see what was happening, but she knew better than to run to Silas\u0027s aid. \"Dad!\" yelled Jenna, getting out of the canoe. \"I\u0027ll help you, Dad.\" \"No!\" Marcia told her. \"No. That\u0027s how the Marshfire works. The bog will drag you down too.\" \"But - but we can\u0027t just watch Dad drown!\" cried Jenna. Suddenly a squat brown shape heaved itself out of the water, scrambled up the bank and, leaping expertly from tussock to tussock, ran toward Silas. \"What you doin\u0027 in the Quake Ooze, sir?\" said the Boggart crossly. \"Whaaa?\" mumbled Silas whose ears were full of mud and could hear only the shrieking and wailing of the creatures in the bog beneath him. The bony fingers continued their pulling and twisting, and Silas was beginning to feel the painful cuts of razor-sharp teeth nipping at his head. He struggled frantically, but each struggle pulled him farther down into the Doze and set off another wave of screeching. Jenna and Nicko watched Silas slowly sinking into the Ooze with horror. Why didn\u0027t the Boggart do something? Now, before Silas disappeared forever. Suddenly Jenna could stand it no longer and sprang up again from the canoe, and Nicko went to follow her. Boy 412, who had heard all about Marshfire from the only survivor of a platoon of Young Army boys who had gotten lost in the Quake Ooze a few years earlier, grabbed hold of Jenna and tried to pull her back into the canoe. Angrily, she pushed him away. The sudden movement caught the Boggart\u0027s attention. \"Stay there, miss,\" he said urgently. Boy 412 gave another hefty tug on Jenna\u0027s sheepskin jacket, and she sat down in the canoe with a bump. Maxie whined. The Boggart\u0027s bright black eyes were worried. He knew exactly who the knotting, twisting fingers belonged to, and he knew they were trouble. \"Blinkin\u0027 Brownies!\" said the Boggart. \"Nasty little articles. Try a taste of Boggart Breath, you spiteful creatures.\" The Boggart leaned over Silas, took a very deep breath and breathed out over the tugging fingers. From deep inside the bog Silas heard a teeth-shattering screech as though someone was scraping fingernails down a blackboard, then the snarling fingers slipped from his hair, and the bog moved as he felt the creatures below shift away. Silas was free. The Boggart helped him sit up and rubbed the muc from his eyes. \"I told you Marshfire will lead you to the Quake Ooze. An\u0027 it did, didunt it?\" remonstrated the Boggart. Silas said nothing. He was quite overcome by the pungent smell of Boggart Breath still in his hair. \"Yer all right now, sir,\" the Boggart told him. \"But it were close. I don\u0027t mind telling you that. Haven\u0027t had to breathe on a Brownie since they ransacked the cottage. Ah, Boggart Breath is a wonderful thing. Some may not like it much, but I always says to \u0027em, \u0027You\u0027d think different if you was got by the Quake Ooze Brownies.\u0027 \" \"Oh. Ah. Quite. Thank you, Boggart. Thank you very much,\" mumbled Silas, still dazed. The Boggart carefully led him back to the canoe. \"You\u0027d best go in the front, Yer Majesty,\" the Boggart said to Marcia. \"He\u0027s in no fit state ter drive one a these things.\" Marcia helped the Boggart get Silas into the canoe, and then the Boggart slipped into the water. \"I\u0027ll take you to Miss Zelda\u0027s. But mind you keep that animal out me way,\" he said, glaring at Maxie. \"Brought me out in a nasty rash that growlin did. I is covered in lumps now. Here feel this.\" The Boggart offered his large round tummy for Marcia to feel. \"It\u0027s very kind of you, but no thank you, not just now,\" said Marcia faintly. \"Another time, then.\" \"Indeed.\" \"Right, then.\" The Boggart swam toward a small channel that no one had even noticed before.\"Now, you followin\u0027?\" he asked, not for the last time.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/magyk-septimus-heap-1/page-16.html","bookId":2704,"book":{"id":2704,"title":"Magyk (Septimus Heap #1)","description":"Storyline: Magyk (Septimus Heap #1) The seventh son of the seventh son, aptly named Septimus Heap, is stolen the night he is born by a midwife who pronounces him dead.
