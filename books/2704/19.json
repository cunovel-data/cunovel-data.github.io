{"id":73548,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"Aunt Zelda\\n\\n Good morning, everyone!\" Aunt Zelda\u0027s cheery voice called out to the pile of quilts and their inhabitants by the fire. Boy 412 woke up in a panic, expecting to have to tumble out of his Young Army bed and line up outside in thirty seconds flat for roll call. He stared uncomprehendingly at Aunt Zelda, who looked nothing like his usual morning tormenter, the shaven-headed Chief Cadet, who took great pleasure in chucking buckets of icy water over anyone who didn\u0027t jump out of bed immediately. The last time that had happened to Boy 412, he had had to sleep in a cold, wet bed for days before it dried out. Boy 412 leaped to his feet with a terrified look on his face but relaxed a little when he noticed that Aunt Zelda did not actually have a bucket of icy water in her hand. Rather, she was carrying a tray laden with mugs of hot milk and a huge pile of hot buttered toast.\\n\\n \"Now, young man,\" said Aunt Zelda, \"there\u0027s no rush. Just snuggle yourself back down and drink this while it\u0027s still hot.\" She offered a mug of milk and the biggest slice of toast to Boy 412, who looked, she thought, like he could do with fattening up.\\n\\n Boy 412 sat back down, wrapped his quilt around him and somewhat warily drank the hot milk and ate his buttered toast. In between sips of milk and mouthfuls of toast he glanced around him, his dark gray eyes wide with apprehension.\\n\\n Aunt Zelda settled herself down on an old chair beside the fire and threw a few logs onto the embers. Soon the fire was blazing, and Aunt Zelda sat contentedly warming her hands by the flames. Boy 412 glanced at Aunt Zelda whenever he thought she wouldn\u0027t notice. Of course she did notice, but she was used to looking after frightened and injured creatures, and she saw Boy 412 as no different from the assortment of marsh animals that she regularly nursed back to health. In fact, he particularly reminded her of a small and very frightened rabbit she had rescued from the clutches of a Marsh Lynx not long ago. The Lynx had been taunting the rabbit for hours, nipping its ears and throwing it about, enjoying the rabbit\u0027s frozen terror before it would eventually decide to break its neck. When, in an overenthusiastic throw, the Lynx had hurled the terrified animal into her path, Aunt Zelda had snatched the rabbit up, stuffed it into the large bag she always took out with her and gone straight home, leaving the Lynx wandering around for hours searching for its lost prey.\\n\\n That rabbit had spent days sitting by the fire looking at her in just the same way that Boy 412 was now. Aunt Zelda reflected as she busied herself with the fire, careful not to frighten Boy 412 by looking at him for very long, the rabbit had recovered, and she was sure Boy 412 would too.\\n\\n Boy 412s sidelong glances took in Aunt Zelda\u0027s frizzy gray hair, rosy cheeks, comfortable smile and friendly witch\u0027s brilliant blue eyes. He needed quite a few glances to take in her large patchwork dress, which made it hard to tell exactly what shape she might be, especially when she was sitting down. It gave Boy 412 the impression that Aunt Zelda had walked into a large patchwork tent and had just, that very minute, poked her head out of the top to see what was going on. Briefly, a smile flickered at the corner of his mouth at the thought.\\n\\n Aunt Zelda noticed the hint of a smile and was pleased. She had never in her life seen such a pinched and frightened-looking child, and it upset her to think about what could have made Boy 412 become that way. She had heard talk about the Young Army in her occasional visits to the Port, but she had never really believed all the terrible stories she had heard. Surely no one could treat children in such a way? But now she began to wonder whether there was more truth in them than she had realized.\\n\\n Aunt Zelda smiled at Boy 412; then with a comfortable groan she heaved herself out of the chair and pottered off to fetch some more hot milk.\\n\\n While she was gone Nicko and Jenna woke up. Boy 412 stared at them and moved away a little, remembering only too well Jenna\u0027s armlock of the night before. But Jenna just smiled sleepily at him and said, \"Did you sleep well?\"\\n\\n Boy 412 nodded and stared at his almost empty mug of milk.\\n\\n Nicko sat up, grunted a hello in Jenna and Boy 412\u0027s direction, grabbed a slice of toast and was surprised to find how hungry he was. Aunt Zelda arrived back at the fireside carrying a jug of hot milk.\\n\\n \"Nicko!\" Aunt Zelda smiled. \"Well, you\u0027ve changed a bit since I last saw you, that\u0027s for sure. You were just a little baby then. Those were the days when I used to visit your ma and pa in The Ramblings. Happy days.\"\\n\\n Aunt Zelda sighed and passed Nicko his hot milk.\\n\\n \"And our Jenna!\" - Aunt Zelda smiled a broad smile at her - \"I always wanted to come and see you, but things became very difficult after the ... well, after a while. But Silas has been making up for lost time and telling me all about you.\"\\n\\n Jenna smiled a little shyly, glad that Aunt Zelda had said \"our.\" She took the mug of hot milk that Aunt Zelda offered her and sat sleepily looking at the fire.\\n\\n A contented silence fell for a while, broken only by the sound of Silas and Maxie still snoring upstairs and toast being munched downstairs. Jenna, who was leaning against the wall by the fire, thought she could hear a faint sound of meowing from inside the wall, but as that was obviously impossible, she decided it must be coming from outside and ignored it. But the meowing continued. It became steadily louder and, thought Jenna, crosser. She put her ear to the wall and heard the distinctive sounds of an angry cat. \"There\u0027s a cat in the wall...\" said Jenna.\\n\\n \"Go on,\" said Nicko. \"I don\u0027t know that one.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not a joke. There is a cat in the wall. I can hear it.\"\\n\\n Aunt Zelda jumped up. \"Oh, my. I completely forgot about Bert! Jenna love, could you just open Bert\u0027s door for her, please?\" Jenna looked confused. Aunt Zelda pointed to a small wooden door set into the bottom of the wall beside Jenna. Jenna tugged at the little door. It flew open, and out waddled an angry duck.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m so sorry, Bert darling,\" apologized Aunt Zelda. \"Have you been waiting for ages?\"\\n\\n Bert waddled unsteadily over the heap of quilts and sat herself down by the fire. The duck was cross. She very deliberately turned her back on Aunt Zelda and ruffled her feathers. Aunt Zelda leaned over and stroked her.\\n\\n \"Let me introduce you to my cat, Bert,\" she said.\\n\\n Three pairs of bewildered eyes stared at Aunt Zelda. Nicko inhaled his milk and started choking. Boy 412 looked disappointed. He was just starting to like Aunt Zelda and now it turned out she was as mad as the rest of them.\\n\\n \"But Bert\u0027s a duck,\" said Jenna. She was thinking that someone had to say it, and they had better say it straight away before they all got into the let\u0027s-pretend-the-duck\u0027s-a-cat-just-to-humor-Aunt-Zelda thing.\\n\\n \"Ah, yes. Well, of course she is a duck at the moment. In fact, she has been a duck for a while now, haven\u0027t you, Bert?\"\\n\\n Bert gave a small meow.\\n\\n \"You see, ducks can fly and swim and that is a great advantage in the marshes. And I have yet to meet a cat who enjoys getting her feet wet, and Bert was no exception. So she decided to become a duck and enjoy the water. And you do, don\u0027t you, Bert?\"\\n\\n There was no answer. Like the cat she really was, Bert had fallen asleep by the fire.\\n\\n Jenna tentatively stroked the duck\u0027s feathers, wondering if they felt like cat fur, but they were soft and smooth and felt entirely like duck feathers. \"Hello, Bert,\" whispered Jenna.\\n\\n Nicko and Boy 412 said nothing. Neither of them was about to start talking to a duck.\\n\\n \"Poor old Bert,\" said Aunt Zelda. \"She often gets stuck outside. But ever since the Quake Ooze Brownies got in through the cat tunnel I\u0027ve tried to keep the cat door CharmLocked. You have no idea what a shock it was to come downstairs that morning and find the place heaving with those nasty little creatures, like a sea of mud they were, swarming up the walls and poking their long bony fingers into everything and staring at me with those little red eyes. They ate everything they could and messed up anything else they couldn\u0027t. And then, of course, as soon as they saw me they started all that high-pitched screaming.\" Aunt Zelda shuddered. \"It set my teeth on edge for weeks. If it hadn\u0027t been for Boggart, I don\u0027t know what I would have done. I spent weeks cleaning the mud off the books, not to mention making up all my potions again. Talking of mud, would anyone like a dip in the hot spring?\"\\n\\n A little later, Jenna and Nicko felt a lot cleaner after Aunt Zelda had shown them where the hot spring bubbled up into the little bath hut in the backyard. Boy 412 had refused to have anything to do with it and had stayed huddled by the fire, his red hat crammed down over his ears and his sailor\u0027s sheep-skin jacket still wrapped around him. Boy 412 felt as if the cold of the previous day was still deep in his bones, and he thought he would never again feel warm. Aunt Zelda let him sit by the fire for a while, but when Jenna and Nicko decided to go out and explore the island she shooed Boy 412 out with them.\\n\\n \"Here, take this,\" Aunt Zelda said, handing Nicko a lantern. Nicko gave Aunt Zelda a quizzical look. What were they going to need a lantern for at midday?\\n\\n \"Haar,\" said Aunt Zelda.\\n\\n \"Ha?\" asked Nicko.\\n\\n \"Haar. Because of the haar, the salt marsh mist that rolls in from the sea,\" explained Aunt Zelda. \"Look, we\u0027re surrounded by it today.\" She waved her hand around in a grand sweep. \"On a clear day you can see the Port from where we\u0027re standing. The haar\u0027s lying low today, and we\u0027re high enough to be above it, but if it rises it\u0027ll come over us too. Then you\u0027ll need the lantern.\"\\n\\n So Nicko took the lantern and, surrounded by the haar, which lay like an undulating white blanket over the marshes below, they set off to explore the island while Aunt Zelda, Silas and Marcia sat inside talking earnestly by the fireside.\\n\\n Jenna led the way, closely followed by Nicko, while Boy 412 lagged behind, shivering every now and then and wishing he was back by the fire. The snow had melted in the warmer, damper marsh climate, and the ground was damp and soggy. Jenna took a path that led them down to the banks of the Mott. The tide had dropped and the water had all but disappeared, leaving marsh mud behind it, which was covered with hundreds of bird footprints and a few zigzag water snake trails.\\n\\n Draggen Island itself was about a quarter of a mile long and looked as if someone had cut a huge green egg in half lengthways and plopped it down on top of the marsh. A footpath ran all the way around it along the bank of the Mott, and Jenna set off along the path, breathing in the cold salt air rolling in from the haar. Jenna liked the haar surrounding them. It made her feel safe at last - no one could find them now.\\n\\n Apart from the boat-dwelling chickens, which Jenna and Nicko had seen earlier that morning, they found a nanny goat tethered in the middle of some long grass. They also found a colony of rabbits living in a burrow bank that Aunt Zelda had fenced off to keep the rabbits out of the winter cabbage patch.\\n\\n The well-worn path took them past the burrows, through a lot of cabbages and wound down to a low-lying patch of mud and suspiciously bright green grass.\\n\\n \"Do you reckon there might be some of those Brownies in there?\" Jenna whispered to Nicko, hanging back a little.\\n\\n Some bubbles floated to the surface of the mud, and there was a loud sucking noise as if someone was trying to pull a stuck boot from out of the mire. Jenna jumped back in alarm as the mud bubbled and heaved.\\n\\n \"Not if I\u0027ve got anything ter do with it, there won\u0027t be.\" The broad brown face of the Boggart pushed its way to the surface. He blinked the Ooze away from his round black eyes and regarded them with a bleary gaze. \"Mornin\u0027,\" he said slowly.\\n\\n \"Good morning, Mr. Boggart,\" said Jenna.\\n\\n \"Just Boggart\u0027ll do, ta.\"\\n\\n \"Is this where you live? I hope we\u0027re not disturbing you?\" Jenna said politely.\\n\\n \"Well you is disturbing me, as a matter of fact. I sleeps in the day, see.\" The Boggart blinked again and began to sink back into the mud. \"But you\u0027s not ter know that. Just don\u0027t mention them Brownies as it wakes me up, see. Just hearin\u0027 the name gets me all wide awake.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" said Jenna. \"We\u0027ll go away and leave you in peace.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" agreed the Boggart, and he disappeared back into the mud.\\n\\n Jenna, Nicko and Boy 412 tiptoed back up the path.\\n\\n \"He was cross, wasn\u0027t he?\" said Jenna.\\n\\n \"No,\" said Nicko. \"I reckon he\u0027s always like that. He\u0027s okay.\"\\n\\n \"I hope so,\" said Jenna.\\n\\n They carried on walking around the island until they reached the blunt end of the green \"egg.\" This consisted of a large grassy mound covered with a scattering of small, prickly round bushes. They wandered across the mound and stopped for a while, watching the haar swirling below them.\\n\\n Jenna and Nicko had been silent in case they should wake the Boggart up again, but as they stood on top of the mound Jenna said, \"Don\u0027t you think there\u0027s a funny feeling under your feet?\"\\n\\n \"My boots are a bit uncomfortable,\" said Nicko, \"now you mention it. I think they\u0027re still wet.\"\\n\\n \"No. I mean the ground under your feet. It feels kind of ... er...\"\\n\\n \"Hollow,\" supplied Nicko.\\n\\n \"Yes, that\u0027s it. Hollow.\" Jenna stamped her foot down hard. The ground was firm enough, but there was something about it that felt different.\\n\\n \"Must be all those rabbit burrows,\" said Nicko.\\n\\n They wandered off down the mound and headed toward a large duck pond with a wooden duck house beside it. A few ducks noticed them and began to waddle over the grass in the hope that they might have brought some bread with them.\\n\\n \"Hey, where\u0027s he gone?\" Jenna suddenly said, looking around for Boy 412.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s probably gone back to the cottage,\" said Nicko. \"I don\u0027t think he likes being with us much.\"\\n\\n \"No, I don\u0027t think he does - but aren\u0027t we meant to be looking after him? I mean, he might have fallen into the Boggart patch, or the ditch or a Brownie might have got him.\" \"Shhh. You\u0027ll wake the Boggart up again.\"\\n\\n \"Well, a Brownie might have got him. We ought to try and find him.\"\\n\\n \"I suppose,\" said Nicko doubtfully, \"that Aunt Zelda will be upset if we lose him.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I will too,\" said Jenna.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t like him, do you?\" asked Nicko. \"Not after the little twerp nearly got us killed?\"\\n\\n \"He didn\u0027t mean to,\" said Jenna. \"I can see that now. He was as scared as we were. And just think, he\u0027s probably been in the Young Army all his life and never had a mum or dad. Not like us. I mean you,\" Jenna corrected herself.\\n\\n \"You have had a mum and dad. Still have. Silly,\" said Nicko. \"All right, we\u0027ll go and look for the kid if you really want to.\"\\n\\n Jenna looked around, wondering where to start, and realized she could no longer see the cottage. In fact she could no longer see much at all except for Nicko, and that was only because his lantern gave off a low red light.\\n\\n The haar had risen. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/magyk-septimus-heap-1/page-19.html","bookId":2704,"book":{"id":2704,"title":"Magyk (Septimus Heap #1)","description":"Storyline: Magyk (Septimus Heap #1) \\n The seventh son of the seventh son, aptly named Septimus Heap, is stolen the night he is born by a midwife who pronounces him dead.
