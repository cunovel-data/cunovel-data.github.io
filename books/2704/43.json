{"id":73572,"no":43,"title":"Page 43","content":"A Visitor\\n\\n The next morning all that Jenna could see of the Vengeance was the top of the tallest mast sticking out of the marsh like a lone flagpole, from which fluttered the remnants of the tops\u0027l. The remains of the Vengeance was not something Jenna wanted to look at, but like everyone in the cottage who woke up after her, she had to see with her own eyes what had happened to the Darke ship. Jenna closed the shutter and turned away. There was another boat that she would much rather see.\\n\\n The Dragon Boat.\\n\\n Jenna stepped out of the cottage into the early morning spring sunshine. The Dragon Boat lay majestically in the Mott, floating high in the water, her neck stretched out and her golden head held aloft to catch the warmth of the first sunlight to fall upon her for hundreds of years. The shimmer of the green scales on the dragon\u0027s neck and tail and the glint of the gold on her hull made Jenna screw her eyes up against the glare. The dragon had her eyes half closed too. At first Jenna thought the dragon was still asleep, but then she realized that she was also shielding her eyes against the brightness of the light. Ever since Hotep-Ra had left her entombed under the earth, the only light the Dragon Boat had seen had been a dull glow from a lantern.\\n\\n Jenna walked down the slope to the landing stage. The boat was big, much bigger than she remembered from the night before, and was wedged tightly into the Mott now that the floodwater had left the marshes. Jenna hoped the dragon did not feel trapped. She reached up on tiptoes to put her hand on the dragon\u0027s neck.\\n\\n Good morning, my lady, the dragon\u0027s voice came to her.\\n\\n \"Good morning, Dragon,\" Jenna whispered. \"I hope you\u0027re comfortable in the Mott.\"\\n\\n There is water beneath me, and the air smells of salt and sunshine. What more could I wish for? asked the dragon.\\n\\n \"Nothing. Nothing at all,\" agreed Jenna. She sat down on the landing stage and watched the curls of the early morning mist disappear in the warmth of the sun. Then she leaned back contentedly against the Dragon Boat and listened to the dabblings and splashings of the various creatures in the Mott. Jenna had become used to all the underwater inhabitants by now. She no longer shuddered at the eels who made their way out along the Mott on their long journey to the Sargasso Sea. She didn\u0027t mind the Water Nixies too much, although she no longer paddled with bare feet in the mud, after one had stuck itself onto her big toe and Aunt Zelda had had to threaten it with the toasting fork to get it to drop off. Jenna even quite liked the Marsh Python, but that was probably because it had not returned since the Big Thaw. She knew the noises and splashes that each creature made, but as she sat in the sun, dreamily listening to the splish of a water rat and the gloop of a mudfish, she heard something she did not recognize.\\n\\n The creature, whatever it was, moaned and groaned pathetically. Then it puffed, splashed and groaned some more. Jenna had never heard anything like it before. It also sounded rather large. Taking care to keep out of sight, Jenna crept behind the thick green tail of the Dragon Boat, which was curled up and resting on the landing stage; then she peered over to see what creature could possibly be making so much fuss.\\n\\n It was the Apprentice.\\n\\n He lay facedown on a tarry plank of wood that looked as though it had come from the Vengeance and was paddling it along the Mott using just his hands. He looked exhausted. His grubby green robes clung to him and steamed in the early morning warmth, and his lanky dark hair was straggling over his eyes. He seemed hardly to have the energy to raise his head and look where he was going.\\n\\n \"Oi!\" yelled Jenna. \"Go away.\" She picked up a rock to throw at him.\\n\\n \"No. Please don\u0027t,\" pleaded the boy.\\n\\n Nicko appeared. \"What\u0027s up, Jen?\" He followed Jenna\u0027s gaze. \"Hey, shove off, you!\" he yelled.\\n\\n The Apprentice took no notice. He paddled his plank up to the landing stage and then just lay there, exhausted.\\n\\n \"What do you want?\" asked Jenna.\\n\\n \"I ... the ship ... it\u0027s gone down. I escaped.\"\\n\\n \"Scum always floats to the surface,\" Nicko observed.\\n\\n \"We were covered in creatures. Brown, slimy ... things.\" The boy shivered. \"They pulled us down into the marsh. I couldn\u0027t breathe. Everyone\u0027s gone. Please help me.\"\\n\\n Jenna stared at him, wavering. She had woken up early because she had been having nightmares full of screaming Brownies pulling her down into the marsh. Jenna shuddered. She didn\u0027t want to think about it. If she couldn\u0027t bear to even think about it, how much worse must it be for a boy who had actually been there?\\n\\n The Apprentice could see that Jenna was hesitating. He tried again. \"I - I\u0027m sorry for what I did to that animal of yours.\"\\n\\n \"The Boggart is not an animal,\" said Jenna indignantly. \"And he is not ours. He is a creature of the marsh. He belongs to no one.\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\" The Apprentice could see he had made a mistake. He changed back to what had worked before. \"I\u0027m sorry. I - I just ... feel so scared.\"\\n\\n Jenna relented. \"We can\u0027t just leave him lying on a plank,\" she said to Nicko.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t see why not,\" said Nicko, \"except I suppose he\u0027s polluting the Mott.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027d better take him inside,\" said Jenna. \"Come on, give us a hand.\"\\n\\n They helped the Apprentice off his plank and half carried, half led him up the path and into the cottage.\\n\\n \"Well, look what the cat dragged in,\" was Aunt Zelda\u0027s comment as Nicko and Jenna dumped the boy down in front of the fire, waking up a bleary-eyed Boy 412. Boy 412 got up and moved away. He had seen a flicker of Darke Magyk as the Apprentice came in.\\n\\n The Apprentice sat pale and shivering beside the fire. He looked ill.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t let him out of your sight, Nicko,\" said Aunt Zelda. \"I\u0027ll go and get him a hot drink.\"\\n\\n Aunt Zelda came back with a mug of chamomile and cabbage tea. The Apprentice pulled a face but drank it down. At least it was hot.\\n\\n When he had finished, Aunt Zelda said to him, \"I think you had better tell us why you have come here. Or rather, you had better tell Madam Marcia. Marcia, we have a visitor.\"\\n\\n Marcia was at the door, having just got back from an early morning walk around the island, partly to see what had happened to the Vengeance but mostly just to taste the sweet spring air and the even sweeter taste of freedom. Although Marcia was thin after almost five weeks\u0027 imprisonment and there were still dark shadows under her eyes, she looked much better than she had the night before. Her purple silk robes and tunic were fresh and clean, thanks to a complete Five-Minute DeepClean Spell, which she hoped had got rid of any traces of Darke Magyk. Darke Magyk was sticky stuff and Marcia had had to be particularly thorough. Her belt shone bright after its Pristine Polish and around her neck hung the Akhu Amulet. Marcia felt good. She had her Magyk back, once again she was ExtraOrdinary Wizard, and all was right with the world.\\n\\n Apart from the galoshes.\\n\\n Marcia kicked the offending articles of footwear off at the door and peered into the cottage, which seemed gloomy after the bright spring sunshine. There was a particular darkness by the fire, and it took a moment for Marcia to register who exactly was sitting there. When she realized who it was, her expression clouded. \"Ah, the rat from the sinking ship,\" she snapped.\\n\\n The Apprentice said nothing. He looked shiftily at Marcia, his pitch-black eyes coming to rest on the Amulet.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t touch him, anyone,\" warned Marcia.\\n\\n Jenna was surprised at Marcia\u0027s tone, but she moved away from the Apprentice as did Nicko. Boy 412 went over to Marcia.\\n\\n The Apprentice was left alone by the fire. He turned to face the disapproving circle that surrounded him. It was not meant to go like this. They were meant to feel sorry for him. The Queenling did. He had already won her over. And the mad White Witch. It was just his luck that the interfering ex-ExtraOrdinary Wizard had turned up at the wrong moment. He scowled in frustration.\\n\\n Jenna looked at the Apprentice. He looked different somehow, but she could not work out what it was. She put it down to his terrible night on a ship. Being dragged into the Quake Ooze by hundreds of screaming Brownies would be enough to give anyone the dark, haunted look in the boy\u0027s eyes.\\n\\n But Marcia knew why the boy looked different. On her morning walk around the island she had seen the reason why, and it was a sight that had quite put her off her breakfast; although, admittedly, it did not take much to put Marcia off Aunt Zelda\u0027s breakfasts.\\n\\n So when the Apprentice suddenly leaped to his feet and ran toward Marcia with his hands outstretched, poised to grab at her throat, Marcia was ready for him. She ripped the clutching fingers from the Amulet and hurled the Apprentice out the door with a resounding crack of a Thunderflash. The boy lay sprawled, unconscious, on the path.\\n\\n Everyone crowded around. Aunt Zelda was shocked. \"Marcia,\" she muttered, \"I think you might have overdone it. He may be the most unpleasant boy I have ever had the misfortune to come across, but he\u0027s still only a boy.\"\\n\\n \"Not necessarily,\" was Marcia\u0027s grim reply. \"And I haven\u0027t finished yet. Stand back, please, everyone.\"\\n\\n \"But,\" whispered Jenna, \"he\u0027s our brother.\"\\n\\n \"I think not,\" said Marcia crisply.\\n\\n Aunt Zelda put her hand on Marcia\u0027s arm. \"Marcia. I know you\u0027re angry. You have every right to be after your time as a prisoner, but you mustn\u0027t take it out on a child.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not taking it out on a child, Zelda. You should know me better than that. This is no child. This is DomDaniel.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Anyway, Zelda, I am no Necromancer,\" Marcia told her. \"I will never take a life. All I can do is to return him to where he was when he did this dreadful thing - to make sure that he does not profit from what he has done.\"\\n\\n \"No!\" yelled the Apprentice-shaped DomDaniel.\\n\\n He cursed the thin, reedy voice in which he was forced to speak. It had annoyed him enough to hear it when it had belonged to the wretched boy, but now that it belonged to him it was unbearable. DomDaniel struggled to his feet. He could not believe the failure of his plan to retrieve the Amulet. He had had them all fooled. They had taken him in out of their misguided pity, and they would have looked after him too, until he found the right time to take back the Amulet. And then - ah, how different things would have been then. Desperately he gave it one last try. He threw himself to his knees.\\n\\n \"Please,\" he begged. \"You\u0027ve got it wrong. It\u0027s only me. I\u0027m not - \"\\n\\n \"Begone!\" Marcia commanded him.\\n\\n \"No!\" he screamed.\\n\\n But Marcia continued:\\n\\n Begone.\\n\\n Back to where you were,\\n\\n When you were\\n\\n What you were!\\n\\n And he was gone, back to the Vengeance, buried deep in the dark recesses of the mud and the Ooze.\\n\\n Aunt Zelda looked upset. She still could not believe that the Apprentice really was DomDaniel. \"That\u0027s a terrible thing to do, Marcia,\" she said. \"Poor boy.\"\\n\\n \"Poor boy, my foot,\" snapped Marcia. \"There\u0027s something you should see.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/magyk-septimus-heap-1/page-43.html","bookId":2704,"book":{"id":2704,"title":"Magyk (Septimus Heap #1)","description":"Storyline: Magyk (Septimus Heap #1) \\n The seventh son of the seventh son, aptly named Septimus Heap, is stolen the night he is born by a midwife who pronounces him dead.
