However, immediately afterwards, she curled up into a ball, releasing all of her reservations, laying before Madeline just like that. Then, the young lady discovered with shock that the consciousness that belonged to Snow herself unexpectedly entered a half dormant state. This meant that Snow already completely dropped all of her defenses and vigilance, just a light wave of her sword able to cut her in half. No ultra life form would do this before another unfamiliar ultra life form, yet Snow did this. This could only mean that she felt complete trust in her mother. In Madeline’s memories, the scenes belonging to Helen were extremely few, but this was indeed a woman who left her with a deep impression. From the moment she saw Helen, the young lady developed an extremely uncomfortable feeling. Her sharp intuition told Madeline that Helen carried a faint hostility against her, to the point where there was a killing intent that wanted her dead. However, at that time, she was still a child, she was still extremely dependent and fond of Persephone. From Persephone’s body, the young lady could find a sunlight similar to Su’s. That was why whenever Madeline couldn’t stand Dark Red Castle’s darkness and bloodiness, she would always look for Persephone, and then say everything that was on her mind. She remembered that one afternoon, after hearing her story, Persephone was suddenly moved for some reason, and then her pencil made a sketch, the scene of Su holding the little girl’s hand, facing the boundless wilderness. When she saw this scene, Madeline almost cried out involuntarily! That was Su! That figure that captured all of Su’s charm, if it wasn’t for her touching the paper itself, she would have thought that she really saw Su, that man who brought her eight years of sunlight. At the time, the young lady was so moved she couldn’t control herself. After obtaining this sketch from Persephone, it was as if she obtained the most precious treasure, from them on keeping it close to her chest, allowing him to hear her own heartbeat as well. Memories continuously battered Madeline’s inner barriers. She already no longer put up any guard, instead allowing them to flow past her heart. The sunlight and warmth during the previous half of her life passed by, and then the latter half full of darkness and blood left the young lady in despair, she was no longer the pure and innocent girl from before. When she recalled this, when Persephone made the sketch back then, her entire being seemed to be releasing radiance, the Su that was drawn was even more so filled with charm, as if she herself, in that moment, was already touched. As such, the events that followed no longer seemed so strange and abrupt. “A person as good as him, anyone would want him, who wouldn’t fight over him? It isn’t strange at all! “The young lady released a long sigh. Right now, she finally cast aside the shadows that had loomed over her heart for a long time. Right at this time, Snow suddenly moved, more that ten compound eyes lighting up one by one. However, this wasn’t her will, her body was still sleeping, this was a preset procedure that was controlling Snow’s movements. The dozen or so different colored radiance from the compound eyes ultimately gathered into Helen’s image. Helen was still in her white lab coat, with her casual blonde hair and old-fashioned glasses. Even if it wasn’t a real figure, it still constantly released an ice-cold and mechanical feeling, making one couldn’t help but overlook her similarly beautiful appearance and figure. The image was just like the real person. Helen raised her hand, looking as if she was going to adjust her glasses, but in the end, she lowered her hand again. She looked towards the young lady, and then said, “Madeline, you definitely never thought this day would come, that you would meet me in this manner. However, right now, you should have already guessed at the reason why. Correct, we were past companions, companions for the past millions of years. You are the Sword, while I am the Brain. That is why it is difficult for you all to find me, but I can definitely find you all. We have our own predestinations, as well as an undefiable instinct. In reality, the apostles’ instincts are our true selves, while right now, I believe you are just like me, neither one of us willing to accept our instincts, even more so unwilling to take on the orders given to us by our instincts. Our current selves seem to more so be living a dream, but this dream is just too real, to the extent where neither of us are willing to awake from it. No, not only you and me, someone else who isn’t willing to wake up should be Su, that man who you aren’t willing to let go of even now.” Madeline listened quietly. “Su is already dead, or to be more precise, he has already fallen asleep. Some time in the future, he will awaken through a different method in a different corner of the universe, just like us. However, at that time, he will no longer be the Su you know, this is something that you definitely understand. Su is a type of… existence we cannot understand. Perhaps he is the seventh apostle, perhaps he isn’t. I obtained the inherited memories, but what is strange is that there was no data related to him. Also, there is no information concerning the Lord either. In a little while, I will hand over all of the inherited memories to you.” “I am the Brain, which is why I can deduce what might happen. Your encounter with Su this time will inevitably end in this type of situation. What is unfortunate is that even though I am aware of this, I am unable to stop it. That is why soon afterwards, I will have to face another enemy, she is our, the apostles’ natural enemy, even more likely the enemy of all life. During this battle. I do not have any chance of survival, but I can take her down with me. When you see this message, our battle would have presumably already have ended, because it definitely wouldn’t last that long, a second is already enough.” “Alright, let’s talk about the important matters, as well as what you should really be interested in. I had Snow bring over something, a portion of the perfect body, as well as a part of the Lord’s body after its death. It might very well be able to reactivate Su…” “What?!” Madeline was immediately startled! As if she already foresaw Madeline lose her composure, Helen chuckled, and then said, “Don’t get too excited, this is a good thing for you, but for Su, this isn’t the case. I predict that it will bring him… another instance of tremendous pain. That is why I am handing over the authority to make the decision to you, as for whether you will revive Su or not, it will be your choice. Now, I wish to talk about some private matters as well. Snow is the child of Su and myself, I already set the upper bound of her evolution, so I wish for her to only become an ordinary ultra life form in the future, and not like her father whose potential has no limit. Finally, in this life of mine, I have one greatest regret, only, there will never be a chance to fulfill it…” Madeline listened quietly, her eyes gradually becoming deep, moreover revealing a trace of dejectedness. Helen’s regret similarly came from the softest part in the depths of her heart. Helen’s holographic image became faint, and only then did Madeline snap out of her daze. Snow was still cureld up in sleep, her mouth was opened, a finger-sized transparent tube emerging from her mouth, one could see that this tube contained a drop of silvery-white liquid. It possessed its own consciousness and life, and as if it sensed something, it began to smash itself intensely against the walls of the test tube, wishing to escape. However, the test tube’s material was incomparably sturdy, no room for it to escape at all. It was unknown what type of material the test tube was made of, but it could completely isolate the liquid’s aura, preventing Madeline from examining its contents. However, Madeline already spoke of its origins, this was the Lord’s body. It was unknown just how many years the Lord had been destroyed for, the bit of it that remained divided into thirds. This was only the extracted essence of one portion, yet it unexpectedly could still sense danger, possessing such terrifying vitality. If this drop of liquid was scattered across a normal planet, it would definitely bring about a catastrophic disaster! Madeline reached out her hand to pick up this test tube, bringing it up to her eyes to examine this drop of jumping perfect body. She still couldn’t sense the aura and characteristics on the perfect body, but the perfect body could sense her. It quickly became still. The young lady looked at the perfect body, and then at Su, there was always a bit of hesitation that was impossible to get rid of. She believed the Brain, and she also believed that Su had the ability to suppress this small drop of the perfect body. If the Brain could do it, then there should be even less of a reason why the seventh apostles couldn’t. But… but that was Su. The other injuries he received were delivered by the young lady. Helen’s words still lingered by her ears: I predict that it will bring him… another instance of tremendous pain…” Another instance of tremendous pain. Madeline stared at Su’s calm and perfect appearance, her mind struggling endlessly. However, she wasn’t an indecisive woman, she immediately set her resolution, saying with a soft and resolute voice, “I know that this decision of mine is selfish, but I just want to be with you. I will revive you. As for the tremendous pain, no matter what it is, I will endure it together with you!” With a pa noise, the test tube was crushed.
