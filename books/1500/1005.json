The patterns on the walls didn’t only serve as decorations, hidden within was the incomplete divine language Rochester researched, these patterns possessing powerful weakening effects on perception power. Only the great officiants with the highest level of authority within the church who grasped the divine language could reduced the effects this had on them.\n Su’s Panoramic View was limited to a small twenty meters range. However, he only revealed a faint smile, and then an extremely complex Bisindle divine language symbol was used, broken down into countless miniature symbols, spreading through his Panoramic View. When the divine language patterns on the walls encountered these symbols, they would immediately light up and then break apart, turning into pure energy for the symbols to absorb, instead further augmenting the Panoramic View’s power.\n Layer after layer of walls shone, the beautiful and mysterious patterns on the walls as if activated, appearing layer after layer, releasing brilliant flames. Half of Sun God Temple lit up, and the brilliant world was still growing layer by layer. All of the officiants, monks, red-robed Warriors, and ascetics were stupefied, completely not understanding what was happening. In this world of light and flames, they suddenly felt a mysterious fear.\n Su no longer walked along the corridor, his body instead slowly sinking into the ground. The sturdy rock melted like cheese, allowing him to move through it. Right now, Su’s Panoramic View already extended to around five kilometers around him, about one kilometer lengthwise. Great Sun God Temple’s upper level was already clearly displayed before him, no more secrets hidden. Below the temple, Su already discovered a mysterious and powerful space. His perception similarly encountered interference there, but after destroying the divine language that was arranged there, Su’s perception still didn’t make much progress. When the strands of perception entered the thick ink-like darkness, he could only perceive a small area, producing fragmented images, unable to produce a complete scene at all.\n The underground resistance method was already no longer divine language, but true ability. To be able to withstand Su’s Panoramic View, the other party’s Perception Domain strength was truly shocking, at the very least around eleven levels. That was, without a doubt, Rochester.\n Su increased his speed, his body quickly moving through the rock layers, the sturdy rock crushed into powder from the force field around him, and then sprayed outwards, this force bringing him deeper into the underground depths. Soon afterwards, Su passed through the rock layer, entering an extremely deep and wide underground space. This was a half natural cave, from the top of the cave down to the very bottom over five hundred meters. More than ten underground rivers crisscrossed and converged, forming an incredibly complex terrain. Su had just appeared, yet his eyes already lit up with dazzling radiance, a blazing high temperature cloud already completely surrounding him, the heat that was as high as ten thousand degrees serving as the warm welcome.\n This was an ion cloud, the energy it contained high to the point where even Su’s protective energy field was affected. Su reckoned that if he stayed in the ion cloud for just a few seconds longer, his skin would be completely crystalized. He immediately increased speed, sinking down, immediately leaving the ion cloud’s radius, rushing deeper down.\n What welcomed Su’s eyes was a strange space. The ground surface was covered in layers of purple-colored biomass. Biological solvent continuously moved about, giant tubes that were like blood vessels everywhere. On the cave walls and stone pillars, giant half transparent egg clusters were everywhere. These egg clusters were originally all a square meter in size, one could vaguely make out all types of strange creatures currently being bred. A powerful smell spread through the air, the oxygen content shockingly low, almost nothing on the surface able to survive in this type of environment. However, the toxic air, for these egg clusters’ life that still hadn’t matured, was an essential nourishment. They frantically absorbed this air through the egg cluster membranes, from time to time releasing a bit of clear water-like liquid. When the liquid landed on the biological solvent on the ground, it would immediately corrode away a large piece of the base solvent, producing a large amount of white air. The white air was the main source of the toxic substance in the air.\n After just a voluntary sweep of this place, Su discovered that the number of eggs in this underground space unexpectedly exceeded a hundred thousand, the number of species even more so exceeding a thousand types. In one region, Su unexpectedly discovered that what was being bred were actually humans, moreover those that were already close to adulthood! Su examined them a bit, immediately perceiving all of those nurtured humans’ information. They were indeed human, from their composition to their genes, moreover all of them humans equipped with different abilities. There were officiants and ascetics, some of them equipped with powerful strength, most of them just ordinary robust humans, just that their nervous systems were abnormally developed, these individuals praying monks.\n At this moment, Su couldn’t help but become stunned as well. Could it be that what he saw in Sun God Temple weren’t naturally produced humans, but rather all bred in this underground space? They really were no different from humans, not even Su able to detect anything.\n Regardless of whether he approved of Rochester’s way of doing things or not, the doctor’s skill left Su shocked once again, just like how he shocked the world with the release of the ability Flame.\n A biological breeding on this scale, apart from needing a large amount of materials, an energy source was needed as well. Even though his perception strength was seriously limited, Su still mustered all of his strength, collecting his perception strength into a single beam that shot underground. This full powered attack finally broke through Rochester’s mysterious power’s suppression, successfully reaching a thousand meters underground. What left Su surprised was that this biological solvent’s thickest place was actually eight hundred meters beneath him, forming a blood vessel-like artery, within it flowing an extremely high temperature liquid. The close to thousand degrees liquid transmitted heat into the biological base solvent’s bulk energy converter, and then transformed into the various essential energy forms. Most of it was turned into energy storage matter and preserved, a small portion transmitted to the surface in the form of a biological electric current.\n It seemed like Rochester already dug through the earth’s crust, using the planet core’s limitless energy as the energy supply of this giant biological base. In this brief period of spying, Su discovered that the underground space was several dozen times greater than what he had anticipated, not touching any limits at all. The entire mountain body was hollowed out, and then replaced by large amounts of biological solvent. Several dozen underground tunnels extended into the distance, no end that could be perceived at all. Those underground tunnels were several meters to more than ten meters in diameter, within them arranged hundreds of tubes, with enough space for loading trucks to drive through as well. What flowed through the tubing were all types of nutrients, as well as the high temperature liquid that served as the energy basis. With these tubes, the biological solvent’s area of control would be increased by hundreds to over a thousand times, with no limits in sight at all. Perhaps it was only limited by the fact that it was still tangible matter, but the energy itself was sufficiently ample.\n All of the biological solvent was connected into one body, one completely able to make out a type of strange creature. From a certain perspective, it was more like a blood-sucking parasite that crawled on this planet, moreover belonging to the type that could grow limitlessly. Compared to this planet, it was still small right now, small to the point where it could completely be overlooked. However, the day would eventually come when it would become large enough, big enough to completely suck this planet’s core dry.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-37-7","bookId":1500,"book":{"id":1500,"title":"Demon Hunter","description":"---\n Following the nuclear warfare, massacre extended towards the entire world.
