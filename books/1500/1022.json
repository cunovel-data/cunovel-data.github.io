She lowered her head, looking at Valhalla that was deadly still like a dead fish. Her body suddenly descended, almost instantly already standing on Valhalla. The sturdy superalloy shell warped under the young lady’s feet, and then it released a heavy groaning noise. There was actually a giant opening torn open, thus allowing the young lady to enter. The rupturing continued downwards, opening up a several meters diameter wide passage in the starship. The passage directly connected to the central control room, continued downwards, and then came out through the ship’s belly, thus penetrating Valhalla.\n In the central control room, Fitzdurk and Serendela hurriedly avoided this terrifying energy storm, clearly in a bit of a sorry state. However, they didn’t become angry. Madeline already appeared in the central control room, quietly looking at them. One of the young lady’s blue eyes was looking at Fitzdurk, the other at Serendela.\n As they stared at the young lady’s strange eyes, Serendela and Fitzdurk both felt a strange feeling of coldness within them. Madeline was already no longer human, but rather the apostles’ most powerful sword. Meanwhile, during the endless years, her only mission was killing other ultra life forms.\n “Madeline…” Fitzdurk forced a smile, calling out to her. This was a reaction full of the will of this world, he knew this, yet had no choice but to do so. If there was still a bit of Madeline’s will of this world left, then just like how Serendela was at first, angering the young lady’s will of this world would trigger grave consequences. Fitzdurk wasn’t scared of taking action against Serendela, but he didn’t dare do something similar to Madeline. Meanwhile, what Serendela did, looking back now, truly was extremely stupid.\n Madeline didn’t pay Fitzdurk any attention, instead looking at Serendela. Her left hand grabbed forward, and then the wall in that direction immediately had a huge hole torn open by a powerful force field. Gusglav’s duplicated body flew out from the hole, landing in Madeline’s hands. Gusglav’s duplicated body was five meters in size, yet when carried in the hands of Madeline who looked like an ordinary young lady, he couldn’t even struggle back.\n The heavy sword in Madeline’s right hand moved horizontally, the sword’s edge slicing fiercely across the duplicated Gusglav’s lower body! The high frequency vibration on the sword edge instantly smashed apart everything between Gusglav’s legs, even the genes damaged to the point where there was no hope of recovery. The intense pain made the duplicated body howl crazily. Even though he also had the willpower of Gusglav when he was alive, this type of pain was applied directly to his consciousness, not something a living creature could endure. Moreover, he similarly had his own intelligence and dignity, unlike those duplicated bodies of Su, which was why he knew that Madeline’s blow was the greatest humiliation to any man, as well as an undisguised form of provocation directed at Serendela.\n Aside from the duplicated body, Serendela was also screaming, her face distorted, clearly angered to the extreme, roaring furiously, “Madeline! What are you doing?”\n “Nothing much, I just felt filthy when looking at him, so I just castrated him.” Madeline spoke in an deemphasized manner.\n “He is my created duplicated body, is mine!” Serendela roared out like a female lion.\n “I know… however, hold on a sec, there is still one more!” Madeline flung the castrated duplicated body onto the ground, and then her left hand reached out. The second duplicated Gusglav flew into her hands by himself. The second duplicated body struggled about frantically, even wishing to attack Madeline, but all of his movements were like the punches of an infant, completely harmless. The blood-soaked heavy sword sliced across his crotch, and then even more blood and crushed flesh dyed the blade’s edge.\n After tossing the second duplicated body onto the ground as well, only then did Madeline turn her head towards Serendela and calmly say, “I know he is yours, but so what? I still castrated them, moreover both of them.”\n Serendela’s face continued to distort, not like an emotionless apostle at all. However, no matter how angry she was, she still didn’t take action against Madeline.\n However, Madeline still wasn’t satisfied. She looked at the two duplicated bodies struggling on the ground, and then continued, “Oh, right, they are called Gusglav, right? At least this was their name before. En, their current appearance is quite good, much cleaner. However, Valhalla is still extremely filthy, makes me extremely uncomfortable, which is why I need to do a bit more cleaning.”\n Before she finished her words, Madeline’s left hand rose towards the air again, and then the duplicated bodies of Su flew out from the corners they were hiding in, smashing together in front of the young lady, and then bound together by invisible ropes. There were six duplicated Sus in total. They seemed to have already understood their own impending fate, so they frantically struggled about, all of them displaying deformation abilities that didn’t belong to a human. However, the formless energy ropes were everywhere, binding them up into a sphere. Even though these duplicated Sus were in despair, they still struggled frantically, only, the expressions on their faces were all stupefied, entirely different from the emotional changes of the Gusglav duplications which weren’t any different from the original. They were a pile of animals without souls, only retaining their instincts and outer forms.\n When looking at the duplicated bodies that were bound into a sphere, Madeline raised her chin slightly, and then said with an ice-cold and unyielding voice, “You wanted to duplicate him with just your bit of skill? Nothing more than dreaming! However, they still make me feel disgusted!”\n The heavy sword silently moved through the duplicated bodies, a rain of blood instantly appearing in the air, scattering downwards. The sword’s blade was covered in a powerful vibration, instantly disassembling the duplicated bodies into cellular level particles.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-38-11","bookId":1500,"book":{"id":1500,"title":"Demon Hunter","description":"---\n Following the nuclear warfare, massacre extended towards the entire world.
