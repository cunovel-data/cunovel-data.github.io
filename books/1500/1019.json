Beneath her feet rested Spider Empress’ giant pillar-like broken finger. In Serendela’s surroundings floated more than ten duplicated soldiers, two of them were Gusglav, the remaining all Su. The dozen or so duplicated soldiers similarly delivered visible damage to the Spider Empress. Aside from the duplicated bodies, there were over a hundred flesh puppets. However, in a battle of this level, flesh puppets almost couldn’t display any use, only the strongest few able to leave small marks on the Spider Empress’ arm.\\n\\n When they truly entered combat, Serendela instead calmed down. She discovered that the Spider Empress wasn’t as frightening as she imagined. Even though the aura she exuded and the source of fear in her memories were extremely similar, it wasn’t overwhelming like the source of the fear. Before that type of power, even Serendela felt a deep feeling of despair.\\n\\n Serendela took a deep breath. Her body became longer and taller, only stopping after reaching ten meters tall. This degree of size suited her power well, but compared to Lanaxis, she was still a mosquito-like existence. She floated slowly in the air, looking straight at Serendela, not yielding in the slightest! Battle intent began to burn from within Serendela’s body, but she didn’t recklessly leave Valhalla. Even though she inflicted serious damage on the Spider Empress, that didn’t represent that she would definitely win, instead only signifying that she could fight a battle to the death with Lanaxis. The two apostles, together with Valhalla, could carry out a decisive battle with the current Spider Empress.\\n\\n The damage on Valhalla’s surface was currently shrinking at a visible rate. The ship body trembled greatly, all of the internal composition changing, the vital spatial furnace was already completely isolated and protected. Not even the Spider Empress’ perception was able to penetrate through its protective energy layer, thus unable to pinpoint their location, only able to attack while relying on luck. Moreover, when Valhalla’s inner composition completely changed to combat mode, every area would become an independent space, equipped with many functions. Meanwhile, the most important thing was that the spatial furnace could freely move about inside the ship, signifying that it was now much harder to destroy Valhalla.\\n\\n Fitzdurk hid within the central control room, not revealing himself. He had to control the system modification of the entire ship, repair the damage, and carry out a different type of confrontation with the Spider Empress. Valhalla’s struggle became stronger and stronger, with the rupturing of each energy spider thread, it would decrease her power somewhat. Even if it was just a slight decrease, when everything was added up, it would still bring decisive effects to the battle situation. Moreover, Valhalla was currently quickly being repaired, its recovery speed not inferior to the Spider Empress’. The empress’ right hand’s injuries had already mostly faded, the broken pinky even more so currently growing. From this, Valhalla’s recovery speed was comparable to that of an ultra life form’s, not like a mechanical starship at all, but rather like a living strange creature. Valhalla’s outer wall was also squirming about, trying to repair the damage produced by the spider limbs. The squirming outer walls grinded against the jointed limbs that suddenly penetrated into the ship, releasing ear-splitting noises and large amounts of sparks. This was a battle between two types of matter that were harder than the toughest alloys on this planet, one side wanted to break in, while the other was trying to grind away the intruder.\\n\\n The Spider Empress’ right hand now completely recovered, but it still remained in the air, only using its eight limbs to continuously destroy Valhalla. Meanwhile, her deep cold eyes continuously swept across the starship, a destructive blow clearly brewing.\\n\\n Under thunderous explosion sounds, Spider Empress’ right hand was inserted into Valhalla yet again, while this time, the tip of her middle finger already reached out from the bottom of Valhalla. This fine white and tender looking right hand possessed power far surpassing the eight sinister and enormous limbs. The moment the starship was penetrated, Fitzdurk inside the central control room released a muffled groan, his body image clearly dimming considerably, even more so having a small portion breaking and scattering. Right now, Valhalla was already equivalent to being a part of him, seriously damaging the starship was equivalent to heavily wounding the apostle. Fitzdurk forcefully endured the mental pain, frantically urging Valhalla’s growth. Not only the outer walls, even the inside of the ship produced large amounts of sharp structures, stabbing and hacking viciously at Lanaxis’ arm. Meanwhile, Serendela and her duplicated bodies even more so relentlessly attacked Spider Empress’ arm at this moment.\\n\\n Spider Empress’ human body and arms’ strength were powerful beyond compare, but at the cost of their defense being far less than that of the spider body and legs that were covered in a rock material shell. Apart from Serendela and the very first Su duplication, no one else could inflict any remarkable damage to her spider body. Right now, among Serendela’s duplicated bodies, the first Su’s strength was the most powerful, already catching up to herself in strength. However, the other Sus were of varying strength, yet even so, their combat strength far exceeded the duplicated bodies of Gusglav. Each time she duplicated Su, there would always be clear differences from the other bodies, even if Serendela made the duplication strictly through her memories of him. Even for an apostle, Su’s existence was a complete mystery.\\n\\n In the depths of Valhalla’s ship body, there was an independent compartment. At this time, regardless of whether it was Fitzdurk or Serendela, they had both forgotten that this space existed. At the center of the compartment was a piece of irregularly shaped black iron. More than ten flesh puppets busied about just like before, continuously cutting and grinding the black iron while observing the experimental data on the light screen. The data displayed that the black iron was indeed being whittled away, just that the speed was extremely slow. Based on the current speed, it would be at least a century before the outer shell would be completely stripped away. Before receiving new orders, the flesh puppets continued to work according to their previous orders, polishing the black iron shell to a set degree, and then applying humiliation. They had long become aware of Madeline’s appearance beneath the iron outer shell, which was why they were especially energetic. In reality, as long as there was the order to, they could do it with anything.\\n\\n These flesh puppets were guards and executioners, as well as loyal defenders of Serendela’s will.\\n\\n Perhaps because he hadn’t received an order for a long time, perhaps due to his master Serendela’s sudden anxiousness, one of the flesh puppets suddenly lost control, his powerful instincts taking over all of its actions. His blood suddenly boiled, throwing himself onto the irregularly shaped piece of black iron. Several malevolent and exaggeratedly shaped tentacles reached out from his chest, abdomen, and crotch, forcefully grinding against the iron piece, seeking out any areas that caved in slightly. There were quite a few keratin scales left on those tentacles, but they weren’t damaged in the slightest after grinding against the black iron’s sharp corners. Moreover, there was a corrosive mucus that was continuously released from the tips, smearing all over the black iron piece.\\n\\n When one flesh puppet suddenly went crazy, the other flesh puppets were stupefied, not knowing how to deal with the situation before them at all, nor did they receive orders from Serendela. Their requests to their master for further instructions didn’t receive any response.\\n\\n The flesh puppet crazily grinded itself against the black metal chunk, every movement making it release a low roar of excitement. One tentacle had already grinded against a certain black iron corner several times, but it still wasn’t damaged in the slightest. However, when it grinded against this corner once more, it suddenly silently split in half. This sudden abnormality left the flesh puppet stupefied, and only then did the powerful pain spread from its body, making it howl in suffering.\\n\\n The flesh puppet didn’t see that a fine crack had just appeared on the black iron ridge, an energy stream that was thin like paper rushing out from within, severing the tentacle that was as hard as steel in half. Then, the flesh puppet that was completely overwhelmed by pain even more so didn’t see that the entire black steel was already covered in cracks! Endless energy streaks sprayed out from the black steel, and then rushed past the flesh puppet’s body. The flesh puppet’s movements instantly went rigid, and then when he tried to move about, he turned into countless fine pieces, the largest not bigger than the size of a fist.\\n\\n All of the flesh puppets remained in their original locations in a stupor. They knew that they should throw themselves over or notify their owner, but it was as if their bodies were filled with lead, not moving at all. Meanwhile, all connection with Serendela was even more so severed.\\n\\n The black iron that had been grinded for a long time was currently silently splitting apart, a seductive and beautiful figure standing up from within the black iron fragments. The surging deadly energy blurred her figure, only a pair of dark blue ocean-like eyes flickered with radiance. These were bewitchingly beautiful eyes, but in the eyes of the flesh puppets, it was a dark blue that represented destruction!\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-38-8","bookId":1500,"book":{"id":1500,"title":"Demon Hunter","description":"---\\n Following the nuclear warfare, massacre extended towards the entire world.
