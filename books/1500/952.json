This was a young soldier, but right now, there were two deep and black burnt holes on his body. The automatic rifle’s safety had just been undone, unable to fire even a single bullet. After exerting a bit of force from below his feet, Arnobi already appeared next to this soldier. He lowered his body, picked up the automatic rifle, and then like the most nimble mountain cat, he rushed up a sentry tower before suddenly jumping from the top of the tower. The automatic rifle in his hands sprayed out scorching tongues of flame, round after round of bullets carrying blue electrical flames blasting down all mechanical bugs that couldn’t evade in time. When Arnobi landed again, another twenty or so mechanical bugs’ remains fell. He was already starting to breathe heavily, but the smile on his face only became more and more brilliant. As an ability user with six levels of speed, five levels of electrical energy magic, and six levels in the Mental Domain, he was completely the bane of these mechanical bugs. This was precisely the reason why O’Brien used the most urgent orders to transfer Arnobi from the southeastern line here. More than half of the mechanical bug horde in the sky had been wiped out, most of them targeting Arnobi. More than ten streaks of high energy light beams shot at him. Arnobi raised his hand, five fingers each releasing a streak of electrical light, producing an incomparably smooth electrical mirror. When the high energy light beams landed on the electrical mirror, they were all reflected outwards. The electrical mirror slowly disappeared, while Arnobi’s complexion only paled for an instant. The mechanical bugs’ adaptability was shockingly fast. Aside from the endless high energy light beams that blasted at Arnobi, there were more than ten miniature guided missiles that roared over! Arnobi’s face revealed a sneer, and then he suddenly opened his mouth, roaring into the sky! What was released along with this roar were layers of electromagnetic fields that carried powerful interference properties. The miniature guided missiles immediately lost their targets, their flight trajectory becoming incredibly chaotic, shooting at different corners of the camp in disorder, and then what followed were waves of world-shaking explosions! This wave of attacks almost destroyed half the base, with at least ten lives lost in the process. Arnobi couldn’t care less whether these soldiers lived or died. Forget about the fact that most of the soldiers in the base were newbies without much experience, even if they were battle-hardened veterans, Arnobi wouldn’t feel any distress. His body leaned slightly to the side, evading a steel plate that flew past. He picked up an automatic rifle from beside a corpse, about to teach the mechanical bugs in the air a lesson, but suddenly discovered an injured person from the corner of his eyes. Shiwa! Arnobi looked down on Shiwa greatly, but this didn’t mean that he would ignore him, on the contrary, he was paying special attention to Shiwa, because Shiwa’s surname was Arthur. Shiwa didn’t like Arnobi because his surname wasn’t Arthur, but what he didn’t know was that Arnobi similarly paid some attention to him because of his surname. All because Shiwa was the direct line of descent of the great family, Arnobi temporarily directed his attention away from the mechanical bugs in the sky, instead walking towards Shiwa. Under Arnobi’s two waves of attacks, the mechanical bugs already received serious damage, but less than fifty of them were still moving through the sky. Meanwhile, it wasn’t like the military base had no strength to retaliate, several dozen streaks of fiery lines continuously firing into the sky like flame whips, continuously striking down the mechanical bugs. This was the counterattack made by the veterans in the base, after experiencing Arnobi’s briefing, they at least understood the mechanical bugs’ attack methods and some weak points. Even though they didn’t know everything, at the very least, they weren’t completely powerless to retaliate. Mechanical bugs continuously dropped from the sky, even though their attacks weren’t as destructive as Arnobi’s, they still delivered some damage. Moreover, they knew how to protect themselves, maintaining high speed and irregular movements the entire time. As a result, the damage the high energy light beams delivered was extremely limited, while the miniature guided missiles that were occasionally fired posed a greater threat. Arnobi walked down before Shiwa, squatted down, and then looked at him with interest. Shiwa’s entire body was covered in blood, one of his calves nowhere to be seen, a large hole even opened up in his abdomen. He breathed heavily, blood continuously dripping out from his wounds and mouth, but his eyes that were looking at Arnobi were still full of hatred and viciousness, and not those of begging for mercy. These types of injuries, on a normal person’s body, were life threatening, but for a powerful ability user like Shiwa, they could be treated, and there wouldn’t be any hidden dangers afterwards. That was why in Shiwa’s eyes, there was no need to show any weakness before Arnobi, after all, in the great family’s traditional notions, bloodline was irreplaceable. However, soon afterwards, Shiwa noticed something that was a bit unusual from Arnobi’s smile, which made him suddenly break out into cold sweat. Arnobi reached out his hand, and then a damaged mechanical bug was grabbed over. It only had its drive and perception systems destroyed, the attack systems were still operational. In its stomach area, a diamond shaped crystal was currently spinning about, futilely searching for a target. The deadly high energy light beams were fired precisely from this small crystal. Currently, the crystal continuously flickered with bits of radiance, ready to fire a high energy light beam at any moment. As he watched Arnobi bring over the damaged mechanical bug, Shiwa seemed to have understood what he wanted to do, panic finally flashing past his eyes. He struggled to open his mouth, wanting to say something, but Arnobi continued to smile, placing his finger by the edge of his lips, making a ‘quiet’ signal. Shiwa obviously didn’t want to listen to this, but blood suddenly surged up to his throat, stopping all of the words he wanted to say. Arnobi tapped gently on the mechanical bug, the mechanical bug that was attacked immediately displaying an emergency reaction. The crystal inside became brighter and brighter, and then a high energy light beam fired out from the crystal, blasting open a small hole in Shiwa’s forehead, and then came out through the other end. Shiwa’s expression froze on the spot, his body that was stretched taut slowly loosening up. He was a child of the family ever since he was small, while Arnobi grew up from nothing. Perhaps the two’s pettiness was comparable, but their methods and temperament were worlds apart.
