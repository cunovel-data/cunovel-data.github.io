Even if we don’t have the brain, we still have four companions here, as well as Valhalla, so it isn’t like we have no chance of winning. I can tell that in the decades that you’ve been awake, you haven’t deliberately evolved, to the extent where you haven’t even created a body with slightly superior combat strength. You only have one soldier in your biological army, and he hasn’t matured either. It seems like what the will of this world brought you weren’t only benefits.”\\n\\n The priest was still smiling, not affected by Rochester’s words at all. “The second difference between us, is that I can completely destroy all of you, while you all cannot. Even if you kill me this time, I will be born again soon after in a different place. You all won’t have much time to enjoy your victory. In just a few days of time, very quickly, you all will suspect whether the creatures around you are my reborn self, to the extent where you will even start to suspect other apostles. It is because aside from you, inheritor, no other apostles can recognize my identity. Meanwhile, even you, the wide and farsighted inheritor, wouldn’t have a second chance. Last time, I let you find me on purpose, that was all there was to it.”\\n\\n Rochester’s smile gradually became rigid. He knew that things were just as the creator said. However, it wasn’t like there was no hope. The so-called hope, all rested on Madeline.\\n\\n “Meanwhile, if there really was a miracle, for example, one of you just happened to possess the ability to completely destroy me…” While speaking, the priest, intentionally or otherwise, looked towards the young lady who was only thinking about her own matters on the top of the ship. From his angle, he couldn’t see Madeline, but everyone knew where the focal point of the priest’s eyes rested. After seeing Madeline, the priest continued, “... the conclusion wouldn’t change at all. For example, if I die, the seventh apostle will appear. It is the destroyer, you all will not wish to meet it. Dying under my hands is the end of all, while if you die under the destroyer’s hands, you all will discover that everything has only just begun.”\\n\\n Rochester’s brows furrowed, he didn’t know how to continue the conversation either. Unlike the other three apostles, as the inheritor, Rochester knew many secrets the other apostles didn’t. He understood well that the sixth apostle only appeared later, an apostle who appeared precisely for the disposing of the other apostles. That was why the creator’s strength was definitely much greater than it looked to be on the surface. Moreover, there was a high chance, no, he definitely had the ultimate ability to restrain apostles. However, what he never expected was that there was actually still a seventh apostle!\\n\\n That was why Rochester suddenly felt a bit discouraged.\\n\\n Right at this time, a light metal grounding sound rang out by the apostles’ ears. While they were all stunned, they realized that this was the sound of a heavy sword being dragged along the starship’s surface. The young lady already stood up, following Valhalla’s ship body towards the bow of the ship. Valhalla’s ship body was several kilometers long, but for the young lady to walk to the bow from the center, it only took a few steps. The heavy sword’s edge was dragged along Valhalla, releasing an ear-splitting grinding sound.\\n\\n Valhalla’s bow was a sharp and graceful streamlined shape, in the end gathering to a sharp point. That sleek ship body was something even a housefly would fall from, yet the young lady stood on it steady like a mountain, as if she was one with Valhalla. The young lady seriously overlooked the priest below, the priest also looking at her seriously.\\n\\n Madeline’s hand gradually tightened around the heavy sword, coldly saying, “Even if there is a destroyer, that is something that will happen later. I feel like killing you is still a better choice.”\\n\\n “So that you can at least live for a bit longer?” The priest asked, full of interest.\\n\\n “Correct!” Madeline replied in a straightforward manner.\\n\\n “An extremely truthful, and also regretful answer. The priest released a deep sigh, and then said, “In reality, I originally didn’t wish to seek you all out, after all, the brain still hasn’t appeared. If the five apostles aren’t gathered, then it is extremely difficult to leave this planet, I have more than enough reasons to continue waiting. It is because on your own, it will be hard to find the brain, if it does not appear on its own. Unfortunately, why did you all have to start the purge? Moreover a thorough purge. Even though doing this might have a chance of finding the brain, it will also kill the will of this world. Meanwhile, I really do not wish to see the will of this world die just like this, after all, it has allowed me to spend several decades in a wonderful dream. That is why…”\\n\\n “That is why, let’s fight!” Madeline issued the challenge of war in the priest’s place.\\n\\n The priest nodded, and then began to move his sleeves. Meanwhile, the puppy by his feet began to release a low roar. This was an extremely comical scene, but none of the apostles felt that this was funny. Madeline’s gaze even more so became penetrating, the heavy sword also gradually vibrating.\\n\\n However, right when the battle was on the verge of erupting, the priest’s ears suddenly moved. It wasn’t only him, the four apostles all heard a vigorous and heavy roar ring from the distance. The source of the roar was extremely far, not in the northern continent at all. The priest stopped his battle preparations, the puppy also calming down.\\n\\n The priest gave Valhalla a glance, and then calmly said, “It seems like our battle has to be delayed for a bit. I need to deal with a target first.”\\n\\n While watching the priest’s figure depart into the distance, the three apostles all released a sigh. When they still had a choice, none of the apostles wanted to face the creator.\\n\\n What the priest and apostles heard, were the roars of Stupas.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-40-2","bookId":1500,"book":{"id":1500,"title":"Demon Hunter","description":"---\\n Following the nuclear warfare, massacre extended towards the entire world.
