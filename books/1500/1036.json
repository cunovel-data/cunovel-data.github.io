The mountain peak gradually unfolded, becoming a several dozen kilometers long biological beast, the high-level combat weapon, Stupa. The Stupa’s movements were rigid and sluggish. Several dozen limbs reached out from the latter half of its body, grabbing the mountain, and only then was its upper half gradually raised, reaching into the sky. Then, after its lower body released a forceful push, only then did the incomparably massive body shoot a kilometer into the air. After the Stupa rose, it descended again, when it finally successfully floated in the air, it was less than a hundred meters from the ground. Meanwhile, the mountain range it originally resided in long broke apart, the scene of collapse suffocating.\\n\\n Inside the western coast’s mountain range, three Stupas rose at the same time. They moved about in the sky, a single motion from their long tails bringing them several dozen kilometers through the air.\\n\\n The underground lake was boiling, eggs breaking open one after another, large and small biological weapons with different functions crawling out from broken eggs one after another, moreover starting to drink the lake water. The lake water was the first time they replenished their energy in their life, for many of these biological weapons, also their final replenishment.\\n\\n Biological weapons finished their meals one after another, then left the lake water, heading towards exits that led to the surface one after another. With countless biological weapons flying together, the underground caves immediately seemed a bit cramped. However, when all of these biological weapons moved through the limited exits, they still seemed neat and tidy, fast and nimble, not running into each other or clogging up the exits at all. The temperature of the lake water gradually rose, one could see that the main brain’s activity was currently speeding up, the number of biological weapons connected to it currently increasing in geometric series. Meanwhile, for the main brain’s massive calculation ability, commanding a biological weapon that was on the level of millions was extremely easy.\\n\\n On the vast southern continent, countless biological weapons rose from the ground, gathering towards the three slowly moving Stupas. Gradually, with the three Stupas as the center, three biological weapons that were each tens of thousands of kilometers in size were formed, producing a giant sphere in the air, and then flying north. In front of them was the line of flames that gradually moved south.\\n\\n Su also left the underground world. His arms were crossed in front of his chest, floating in the air, watching as the biological weapons flew past his body one after another, throwing themselves into the battlefield. At this moment, he unexpectedly had nothing to do.\\n\\n Up north, several hundred combat units were lined up into long arcs, gradually moving forward. They fired high energy light beams according to preset procedures, moreover using incendiary guided missiles to ignite the surface. Their perception devices continuously collected information in their surroundings, and then after doing some simple processing, it would then be passed onto larger scale intelligence centers with faster processing speed, and then ultimately obtain new orders. Countless mechanical units linked together, using a web method to form a giant intelligence network, constantly analyzing the capability and effects of the purging. Moreover, it fine-tuned the attack methods and energy consumption, finding the optimal point of balance between purging speed and efficiency.\\n\\n The combat units at the very front had just received a new order, and as such, they temporarily stopped their attacks to adjust their attack output mode. They wouldn’t stop for more than a second, but in this short moment, several dozen extremely powerful life reactions appeared in the combat units’ range of detection! The combat units’ warning level was immediately raised to the highest level, all of them turning around their high energy light beam firing devices at the enemies who suddenly appeared. However, before the high energy light beams fired, over a hundred sharp bone spurs that wouldn’t produce any reaction already tore through the air! When speed broke through 2000 meters per second, the bone spurs that were as light as a feather already possessed terrifying destructive power. All of the combat units that were struck instantly exploded, a large half of the group of combat units already destroyed under just the first wave of attacks.\\n\\n The ten or so combat units that remained already fired their high energy light beams, the fragmented beams shining on the attacking enemies’ bodies, most of them scattered by the enemies’ scales that were smooth like mirrors, a small portion absorbed by the thick and sturdy tissues underneath the skin. Not a single enemy fell, instead speeding up as they charged!\\n\\n This was a group of mutated creatures that had never appeared in the mechanica units’ database before, their sleek bodies suitable for flight in the air, short wings’ main use was balance and direction adjustment, their anti-gravity organs the main source of motion, at the same time equipped with energy spraying organs for short speed acceleration and directional changes. They instantly pulled the distance between themselves and the combat units close, firing bone spurs again. Under a hundred meters of distance, the ultra high speed bone spurs were just like the high energy light beams, impossible to block. All of the surviving combat units couldn’t fire a second wave of high energy light beams, blasted apart high up in the air. Meanwhile, not a single miniature guided missile was released. The miniature guided missiles the combat units carried were mainly equipped with incendiary properties, moreover used to deal with slow moving targets on the surface, their flight speed unable to catch up to these biological weapons that suddenly appeared, which was why the combat units all tacitly agreed not to fire the missiles.\\n\\n After the combat units in the front were completely wiped out, a powerful detection wave swept out, covering the biological weapons that suddenly appeared. Ordinary creatures would be completely seen through by these detection waves, while a small half of the biological weapons would also be invaded. Within the intelligence network produced by the combat units in the back, an analysis result was immediately produced. These newly produced creatures’ designs were extremely strict and precise, moreover left with some redundant tissues, allowing them to produce adaptive organs. They didn’t have ingestion or digestive organs, only have simple energy absorption and storage tissues, relying on the usage of high energy crystals or fuel to survive. In other words, they didn’t have the ability to survive alone, but were rather creatures who existed solely to fight as part of an army! Moreover their designs were simple and clear, the goal obvious. From an energy exhaustion standpoint, maintenance cost was low, but their combat strength was inconceivably high, quality to price ratio optimal. In the end, the hundred thousand membered intelligence network couldn’t find any way of improving these biological units, meaning that their designs were already close to perfect. Then, this task was gradually passed upwards, all the way until it had the highest priority in the entire mechanical bug swarm’s comprehensive intelligence network. However, no matter how they tried, they couldn’t improve them any further, even though these were only weapons with simple functions, used only as cannon fodder.\\n\\n Before the process of data transmission and analysis exceeded one second, the mechanical bug swarm already decided to pass the information onto Valhalla. That was why after an entire second passed since the battle erupted, fragmented diagrams of the biological weapons appeared in all of the apostles’ consciousnesses.\\n\\n Regardless of what the apostles’ analysis results were like, the battle ahead had already completely erupted.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-40-3","bookId":1500,"book":{"id":1500,"title":"Demon Hunter","description":"---\\n Following the nuclear warfare, massacre extended towards the entire world.
