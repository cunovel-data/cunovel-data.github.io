Su stepped heavily on the mechanical remains, completely crushing it flat.\n He took a deep breath, feeling as if what he breathed in were scorching flames. The great earth that had just crystallized was still releasing astonishing heat, the Stupas’ corpses already starting to burn. The Stupas could endure high temperatures reaching tens of thousands of degrees in temperature, and if one wanted to ignite their bodies, it would take at least a hundred thousand degrees. However, the energy drawn from space was just this great, able to instantly approach several hundreds of thousands of degrees, and that was why even the Stupas’ bodies began to burn. The flames spread far into the distance, everything within a kilometer around the corpses exceeding a thousand degrees. This was a temperature that was high enough to melt steel, yet it will continue to burn for close to a month before stopping. However, apart from a dozen or so kilometers around the Stupas’ bodies, the crystallized great earth didn’t show any signs of melting. In this type of environment, even ultra life forms would find it difficult to survive.\n Bierlus in the sky decreased altitude, lowering its head and releasing a low roar. It was asking for followup plans, as for the deaths of the Creator and its two companions, it didn’t pose much significance for it, because this only meant that they would sleep once more. Fighting that brief battle with the priest had already exhausted most of its energy, the combat strength it could display right now was even more so less than 10% of normal. However, even this bit of strength was enough to deal with a million mechanical bugs, even more so able to display front line command use comparable to part of the main brain’s use. With the Stupa’s existence, the biological army’s combat strength would directly increase by a grade. Right now, Bierlus’ instinctive desire was to sleep and replenish its lost energy. Currently, its vigilance towards this seemingly primitive planet increased greatly, no longer willing to look down on the creatures of this seemingly primitive planet. The word perfect body the priest spoke of before his end, the information it contained, almost made Bierlus want to escape this planet! It didn’t know why either, only instinctively feeling a type of terrifying aura that made it can’t help but want to stay far away from this planet.\n Su took a few steps forward. The surrounding scenery didn’t change at all. The ground was crystallized, air still blazing hot like flames. He just felt as if there was a wave of anger lingering about his chest, making him feel as if he was suffocating. Su had already removed the need to breathe a long time ago, so why did he still have this type of feeling? He didn’t know himself, nor did he want to know why.\n The priest and Little White had awakened their instincts for a long time already, yet clearly didn’t make much battle preparations, both of them taking action suddenly when the situation changed. They perhaps had statuses far greater than ordinary ultra life forms, but on the aspect of energy reserves, they were much inferior, even more so unable to compare with Su who seized Rochester’s decades of accumulation in the southern continent. Perhaps what the priest least expected, was that Su’s status as an ultra life form was actually not any inferior to himself.\n Revelation’s title page had an unremarkable symbol, a symbol that only possessed the basic structure of the Bisindle divine language, but the amount of information it carried was already enough. What was recorded within were the priest’s insights and experiences over the years.\n He roamed the world with the identity of an ordinary human, moreover using the identity of a priest to spread his teachings. This was actually a coincidence, the priest picked up an olden era Revelation, unexpectedly discovering that the teachings conformed greatly with his own perceptions. As such, as he carefully studied it, he gradually discovered that many of the mysteries of the world and life were explained within. Perhaps it was only a coincidence, but it happened. As such, the priest tried to live like an ordinary person, experiencing this world in this way. In his memories, three different points of view were merged together, the viewpoint of an ordinary person, the Creator’s, as well as that of an ultra life form. This left him quite troubled, but brought him even more joy. When the three points of view merged together, he would often forget his own identity as the Creator, and also forget the ice-cold instincts of ultra life forms, more often use the abilities of an ordinary person to live, struggle for survival, moreover try to guide those who were lost in the right direction, even though he himself didn’t even know where the direction was. The status of an ordinary person brought the priest a completely new type of feeling, he felt that he didn’t have to see this world that clearly, nor would he overlook several decades of time with indifference.\n Using this world’s way of speaking, it was a feeling of smothering oneself with a few mouthfuls of strong alcohol.\n This type of person… no, this ultra life form and Creator… actually passed several decades of time just like that. During his final years, he always accompanied Sally, watching her achieve her dreams bit by bit. In the eyes of an ultra life form, this was like a human watching an ant trying to built a massive ant hill. However, the priest always quietly supported her, moreover not doing all that much, not overstepping his status as an ordinary human. However, at the same time, he also did a lot, for example, when the mechanical bug swarm attacked and the biological army went north, the priest released a bit of the Creator’s aura. As such, the mechanical bug swarm and biological army all avoided the inhabited area on their own initiative without being aware of it.\n After receiving the information within the symbol, Su found that he couldn’t muster the slightest bit of joy, his chest instead becoming even heavier. This type of feeling was impossible to get rid of, and it was becoming stronger and stronger.\n Regardless of whether it was the Creator or Su, they were both true, high level ultra life forms, yet they both always wanted to live like ordinary people. Meanwhile, the apostles who were lower level than them triggered all of this chaos, yet they were still properly living. These apostles destroyed Su’s life.\n Su clenched his fists, suddenly releasing an angry roar!\n Su’s roar wasn’t extremely resounding, yet it completely shook up this place. The soundwaves traveled far into the distance, covering the entire southern continent. In every corner of the continent, all types of creatures stopped their activity, looking towards the sky. They all received an order, moreover couldn’t defy it. Meanwhile, in the underground depths, the main brain was currently growing at visible speed, the lake water’s surface gradually becoming lower. A battle was about to start once more, the main brain’s original analysis ability already seeming a bit lacking. Commanding a biological army on the scale of millions was a bit strenuous, and with only Bierlus left out of the three Stupas, the main brain’s burden became much greater.\n In the various corners of the southern continent, countless eggs matured and burst open, endless creatures roaring in pain, their bodies gradually changing, turning into biological weapons one after another. Meanwhile, even more creatures and plants became food for the biological weapons.\n At this time, Su only stood there, a light golden symbol was quickly spinning within the depths of his right eye’s pupil. It continuously released over a thousand golden light specks, every light speck a type of standard biological weapon plan. During this time, whenever one plan appeared, not long afterwards, thousands of this type of biological weapon would appear on the continent.\n Several days later, Su’s biological army numbering in the tens of millions would form. At that time, his army would engulf the entire northern continent like a tide. Even if the apostles fled into the sea, Su would still decisively pursue them to the end.\n This planet didn’t need ultra life forms, even more so didn’t need apostles. Meanwhile, this time, Su didn’t plan to give the apostles the opportunity to awaken again. This seemed impossible, but Su knew that he could do this. A new Bisindle divine language character already clearly told him the way to completely eliminate the apostles.\n Su gazed into the north, calmly saying, “Apostles, you all have four days of time, after four days, my army will be complete. That is why it is best if the four of you come and kill me within these four days. I am right here, not going anywhere!”\n Su’s voice wasn’t loud, yet a special method was used. All of the apostles could hear Su’s declaration from a genetic level. Only, Su didn’t know that in the instant his voice was heard, Madeline’s face suddenly turned pale.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-40-10","bookId":1500,"book":{"id":1500,"title":"Demon Hunter","description":"---\n Following the nuclear warfare, massacre extended towards the entire world.
