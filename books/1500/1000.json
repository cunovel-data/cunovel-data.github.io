However, the significance of Doomsday Storm didn’t just end here, to display a Doomsday Storm on such a large scale, the energy source used was similar to that of a spatial furnace, directly withdrawing energy from the sky. The Spider Empress formed from Dark Red Castle herself was equivalent to a biological body spatial furnace. As long as the body remained unbreaking, the Spider Empress could continuously display Doomsday Storms. After another twenty-four hours at most, she would be able to release the second Doomsday Storm, destroying several hundred square kilometers of the world once again. From the perspective of sweeping the planet, a single Spider Empress’ efficiency was several hundred times greater than Fitzdurk’s.\n A shining stream of data shot out from the space between Fitzdurk’s brows, quickly transmitting into the distance. Water vapor rose from the great sea, and then it they rushed into the air, it broke down again. However, not much was left of the energy fragments flying about in the sky, the crazy high temperature currently dropping, Doomsday Storm already approaching its end. The Spider Empress’ face also revealed a hint of fatigue, a Doomsday Storm of this scale left even her with quite the burden.\n Right when the greater situation was already set, a medium-sized mothership that was only a few dozen meters in length silently appeared from a dozen or so kilometers out. It silently emerged from the darkness, not releasing the slightest energy fluctuation, to the extent where not even the Spider Empress sensed its existence. As soon as it emerged from the darkness, its entire body flickered with radiance, erupting with dazzling radiance. Then, an extremely terrifying energy light pillar tore through more than ten kilometers of distance, blasting the Spider Empress’ body!\n The energy intensity of this pillar of light was countless times greater than that of ordinary mechanical units, equivalent to hundreds of thousands of tons of nuclear explosion energy being gathered together! The instant the energy light pillars took form, this warship itself already completely evaporated.\n A depression appeared on the Spider Empress’ massive body, but this couldn’t stop the energy light pillar. A terrifying hole appeared on her body shortly after, the energy pillar piercing right through her, firing into the ocean, leaving behind a hole that was who knew how deep on the ocean surface.\n The Spider Empress released a cry of pain, the shouting voice like berserk thunder in a storm, ringing far into the distance. Her enormous body gradually leaned to the side, slowly falling towards the deep great sea. However, right when half her body entered the ocean, her eight limbs began to move about, her sinking head rising once more. Then, the limbs frantically climbed, unexpectedly crawling back up to the ocean surface. The surging great sea was just like dry land for the Spider Empress. The wound on her abdomen continuously released flames, but the edge of the wound quickly closed, soon afterwards, the giant wound was sealed, once more covered in black and red patterns. Apart from a slight bit of weakness, the Spider Empress seemed as if she was never injured in the first place.\n Her body floated less than ten meters above the sea surface, waves that were even a bit bigger reaching her body. The Spider Empress’ chest rose and fell, continuously breathing, but her expression was still calm and unhurried, not minding the serious damage she took in the slightest. Only after resting for a few minutes, did she slowly increase altitude, flying into the clouds of radiation, and then she disappeared from Fitzdurk’s web of surveillance.\n Within Valhalla’s central control room, Fitzdurk and Serendela finally felt as if they’ve let out a pent-up breath of air. They didn’t know what the Spider Empress was going to do next, but they understood well that if they sent over another ten million mechanical bugs, they might very well experience another Doomsday Storm. Fitzdurk’s will was instantly transmitted to every mechanical unit, and then the millions of bugs all scattered, starting to establish a web of surveillance over the entire planet. The Spider Empress needed to recover her power, which would inevitably produce large energy fluctuations, so there was no way she could escape Valhalla’s monitoring.\n Meanwhile, Valhalla removed all energy fluctuations from its surface, starting to move through the air at around a hundred kilometers per hour. It was already equivalent to becoming invisible. When moving at this type of low speed, almost no one could find its whereabouts. Within a few hours of time, it would have already moved a few hundred kilometers.\n Serendela’s expression was a bit ugly. Fitzdurk’s manoeuvre was actually running, but she couldn’t oppose this. The Spider Empress only released a single Doomsday Storm, no one knew what her close combat abilities were like. However, general knowledge told them that the close combat abilities of giant creatures usually weren’t too inferior, at the very least, they wouldn’t fear smaller predators. At least right now, Serendela didn’t dare state that she could defeat the Spider Empress with her strength alone, her close combat ability relied mainly on duplicated bodies. Even though the Spider Empress couldn’t block that energy light beam, she couldn’t either.\n That was why Valhalla silently moved under the curtain of darkness, disappearing, silently departing into the distance.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-37-2","bookId":1500,"book":{"id":1500,"title":"Demon Hunter","description":"---\n Following the nuclear warfare, massacre extended towards the entire world.
