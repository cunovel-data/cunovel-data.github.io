He predicted that in just over ten seconds, the biological poison will reproduce to a large enough number, moreover occupy all of the vital nervous tissues. At that time, Gusglav’s combat strength would decrease sharply, and then a minute later, he would completely lose all fighting strength. To poison an eleventh level powerful individual in under a minute, this bit of poison was enough to poison hundreds of thousands of people.\\n\\n Only, the following dozen or so seconds weren’t that easily passed, Su had to face Gusglav’s crazy attacks. Sure enough, when he saw the injury on his body, Gusglav immediately released a world-shaking roar, the furious cry making the entire hall tremble, crushed rock continuously falling from the broken ceiling. Meanwhile, Serendela even more so threw herself at Su with no thoughts of personal safety! Her roar was full of misery, she who also excelled in the Perception Domain obviously knew the power of the toxin Su secreted.\\n\\n Streak after streak of golden light warped and weaved about, the angry roar even more so like thunder, rumbling endlessly. Under the crazy storm of attacks, Su was like a leaf fluttering among great waves, seemingly in danger, yet as the billows rose and fell, great waves passed, but he was still unharmed. Serendela’s eyes were endlessly powerful, if Su remained even a hundredth of a second too long, even he would be burned. Moreover, her eyes released blazing flames, the attack truly following where her sight was, the attacks already fast to the extreme. Meanwhile, oftentimes, the instant before she attacked, Su already moved, avoiding the path of her attack. Even the few attacks he wasn’t able to completely evade only left behind shallow marks on his body.\\n\\n Gusglav endured for longer than he had anticipated, only when half a minute passed did his rate of attacks start to decrease. Now, the state of poison was already extremely clear, aside from his pupils, all other parts of his eyes were dyed in a layer of faint green color. This meant that Su’s biological poison already spread throughout Gusglav’s entire body, just that it was forcefully suppressed by his body’s astonishingly tough immune system. The two sides were currently locked in a stalemate, wearing each other down, but once the immune system’s potential was exhausted, that would be the time of Gusglav’s death.\\n\\n Su began to breathe heavily, the temperature of the flame burning in his thoracic cavity already reaching an extremely dangerous critical point. If he wanted to increase his energy levels any further, then the inner membrane’s protective layer would be melted through, thus turning Su completely into a human bomb comparable to a nuclear warhead. He already did everything he could, yet was powerless to fight back.\\n\\n Clairvoyance wasn’t omnipotence, it was similarly restricted by the other abilities the users had. With Su’s current strength, and Serendela as well as Gusglav’s joint attacks, the fact that he could evade with light injuries was already the best result. Serendela and Gusglav’s attacks all disregarded personal safety, many times attacking with the mindsets of trading a life for a life. Su obviously wouldn’t stake it all against them, because as long as he stalled for another few minutes, stalled until Gusglav collapsed from poison, that would be when he would fight Serendela head-on in a decisive battle. Moreover, even if he wanted to retaliate, Su didn’t have that strength.\\n\\n As Gusglav brandished his hands and sent out kicks, it was as if everything he touched was smashed apart, the power behind the small rock pieces like bullets, those that were a bit larger, simply like artillery shells. If he was struck, even Su would be injured. Perhaps because Gusglav sensed that his life was reaching its end, he attacked crazily like a wounded mammoth, his might seemingly inexhaustible. The underground prison couldn’t endure this level of torment at all, starting to collapse area after area. Cement chunks fell in the tons, and then they smashed into the ground, stirring up endless smoke and dust, the scene one of absolute chaos. However, golden lasers continuously swept about, everything in their path cut through and vaporized, not even the thickest chunks of cement able to resist. Only when the lasers shot through the walls, entering the underground rock layer, their energy exhausted, would they disappear. Miraculously, Gusglav wasn’t affected by the golden radiance at all. Even if he was struck directly, it would only add a layer of golden energy film on his body, this layer scattering shortly afterwards.\\n\\n The more chaotic the battle became, the more favorable it was for Su. However, neither Serendela nor Gusglav were affected by the environment. Serendela who also possessed extreme perception abilities locked firmly onto Su, with even Gusglav who originally wasn’t all that great at perception also able to promptly locate Su’s position. Between the two was some type of special telepathy, or perhaps some type of shared view ability.\\n\\n As a result, Su’s advantage in both his perception and chaotic environment was reduced to the smallest extent, the operation of Clairvoyance also close to its limit, the amount of instantaneous data processing even more so large to the point where he needed to use all of his thought centers to handle it. A scorching feeling continuously transmitted from his skin, being blasted by Serendela’s sight, and also wounded by the chaotic rubble Gusglav kicked out. Meanwhile, his arms, legs, and entire body’s bones released ka ka noises, the pressure they were bearing already reaching a limit. Su’s instantaneous speed was great, but the pressure came more from suddenly changing directions. The power to instantly turn around wasn’t inferior to the blast of heavy artillery.\\n\\n Su’s brain was burning hot, his thought centers already unstable. What was even more fatal was that under this Clairvoyance state, errors in data also began to appear. This might produce a misjudgment, or when the error appeared, there wouldn’t be enough time to correct it. Even though the probability was low to almost reaching zero, it still wasn’t really zero in the end. All things with low probability might very well truly happen.\\n\\n Right at this moment, a chance flashed past!\\n\\n Su didn’t have time to think things through carefully. He immediately moved his body, using his shoulder to face Gusglav’s heavy fist head-on, his hands smashing heavily into his comparatively softer abdomen. Under Gusglav’s heavy fist, Su’s shoulders immediately distorted, his entire body smashed flying. While he was unable to change directions, he also suffered a streak of light from Serendela, producing a two centimeters deep scorched wound by his chest. If it went any deeper, it would open up his chest. Once his chest was opened, it would be a serious injury even for Su, once the high pressure heat stream had an exit to release through, it would immediately produce powerful explosions. At that time, Su might only have a small half of his body left. However, this wasn’t life-threatening either. Su knew that right now, his body wouldn’t truly die, or at the very least, on this celestial body, there were no methods that could make him die. However, it would be unknown what year and month it would be when he returned to the world.\\n\\n When he saw the two holes that continuously dripped with green blood on Gusglav’s abdomen, Su knew that he already took advantage of the opportunity. The newly infused venom would shorten the amount of time Gusglav could hold on for to within a minute. With only a minute left, Su still had the confidence in sticking it through.\\n\\n Guglav’s body rocked back and forth, Serendela’s expression becoming even crazier, frantically attacking while using the most vile language to curse Su. The curses were obviously ineffective, but one could see just how deep the emotions between her and Gusglav were. Ever since the battle began, all of Su’s attacks were gathered on Gusglav’s body, not attacking Serendela once. After his continuous barrage of attacks, Su only left three small wounds on Gusglav’s body, yet the first wound already decided his fate, the latter two only speeding up this process.\\n\\n Only when Gusglav fell would the battle truly begin. The current berserk Serendela would regain her coldness and rationality at that moment, and then fully awaken the apostle instincts. It seemed like Gusglav was the crucial point anchoring Serendela’s will in this world to her body; when he died, only then would she become a true apostle. Meanwhile, at that time, it would be a contest between Clairvoyance and Duplication.\\n\\n With the olden era’s standard, this would be a battle between the minds.\\n\\n Duplication? \\n\\n As if a streak of lightning tore through the darkness, Su suddenly thought of something. His expression immediately changed greatly!\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-34-8","bookId":1500,"book":{"id":1500,"title":"Demon Hunter","description":"---\\n Following the nuclear warfare, massacre extended towards the entire world.
