The powerful kinetic energy was completely stopped by layers of force fields, but one could still see a hole on the skin surface, the border of the hole rippling out like waves, layer after layer.\\n\\n The streak of lightning extracted roughly a third of the sea of electricity. Meanwhile, the brain wriggled with greater speed, the surface of the skin releasing larger quantities, as well as more powerful electrical sparks. Before the paralysis of Su’s body was eliminated, the second thick streak of lightning already threw itself over! This streak of electricity was several times greater than the last one, the energy it erupted with equivalent to a small town’s entire night’s worth of electrical power. Su immediately curled up, placing his hands behind his head, protecting all of his vital areas. In that instant, the force fields around Su’s body completely scattered, a scorching heat suddenly transmitting from his body surface, and then all feeling momentarily completely disappeared, only an expanse of numbness wrapping him within.\\n\\n The electrical current’s high heat instantly charred the surface of Su’s body, even his skin unable to block such a ferocious, pure energy attack, an entire layer pared off. Only, as soon as the second streak of lightning dissipated, a third streak of lightning shot out from the wriggling brain! This time, black dust scattered from Su’s surroundings, the surface layer that had just been carbonized completely destroyed, revealing a layer of newly produced tissues. This wasn’t tender flesh, but rather tissues that were shiny silver like metal, the surface covered in countless fine crystals, as if Su wore an armor made out of crystals.\\n\\n The powerful electrical stream blasted Su’s body fiercely, momentarily unknown just how many fine crystal granules it destroyed. Each time a crystal exploded, there would always be powerful energy activated, forming a chaotic and berserk band of energy around Su’s body, neutralizing quite a bit of the lightning energy. However, the hundred meters sized brain was even larger than two football fields, so when it completely released electrical sparks, this was completely a sea of lightning. The electrical current was already powerful to the point where it could damage the Panoramic View, Su’s current perception also withdrawn to only his body’s surroundings, withdrawing his body to the most he could in order to reduce the surface area that could be struck by the electrical current. The silver skin possessed great conductivity, almost taking in all of the electrical streams, and then neutralizing them through the energy crystals’ explosions. When a layer of crystals was completely used up, there would be new crystals that would appear, this process continuing endlessly.\\n\\n Su and Rochester momentarily entered a deadlocked situation. Su was in a completely defensive state, floating in the air, continuously blasted by lightning. However, if the lightning stopped for even a moment, Su, who was less than thirty meters from the brain’s membrane, would enter it. Once Su invaded inside, then no large scale creatures could endure it. Meanwhile, right now, it was precisely a comparison of energy exhaustion, seeing whether it would be Rochester’s lightning that couldn’t continue anymore first, or if Su’s energy crystals would be completely used up.\\n\\n Apart from lightning, there were several attacks of different attributes that drifted towards Su. There were gravitational spears that increased gravity by several hundred times, as well as spatial attribute ruptures, even eruption points with temperatures close to fifty thousand degrees. These magic abilities, in Rochester’s hands, possessed unprecedented power. This was a destruction carried out purely through energy, almost no defensive methods to speak of, only rushing head-on, carrying out a comparison of energy exhaustion. Meanwhile, this was the case with Su’s crystal granules as well, the crazy energy bands already somewhat similar to chaotic spatial streams, any energy attribute that entered this energy band would be neutralized.\\n\\n After trying several times, Rochester discovered that none of the other attacks were effective, and as such, he focused on using lightning to attack Su. This fella that curled up into a ball seemed like he would never be destroyed. He looked like he didn’t have any power to retaliate, but Rochester understood Su’s power well. As long as Su was given room to breathe, he might be able to reverse the battle situation.\\n\\n “Su!” Rochester spoke up, “I have a never-ending energy reserve, this is merely a small portion of it. Even if this is a war of attrition, you still have no hope of victory. Yield to me, we can deal with Serendela and Fitzdurk together, wipe them out, and then there will be a way to break through the cage. Even though this planet is destined for destruction, I can bring over ten million humans and all types of species from this planet with me. You should have heard of the olden era’s Noah’s Ark story, correct, I can duplicate Noah’s arc, to the extent where it will be countless times bigger than the one from legends! You should know that I have this ability. Continuing this battle has no benefits, it is even more so not beneficial for the human race. I actually do not care about the life or death of the human race, as the natives of this prison, being destroyed along with the prison is the fate they ought to have, this is, unless there is a special reason to change my decision.”\\n\\n Rochester had extra leisure, yet couldn’t break through Su’s defenses, which was why he began to use a different method, trying to use ‘persuasion’ to end this battle. Su represented the will of this world, and not an ultra life form’s instincts. The wills of this world all had various worries, which were also weak points that could be exploited.\\n\\n Su didn’t reply, instead allowing Rochester to continue testing different things. Rochester’s words indeed made some sense, for the human race, giving up the planet for survival was perhaps the better choice.\\n\\n The underground intense battle seemed to be never-ending, the amount of energy that was activated and then neutralized every minute was already equivalent to the full force operation of several large scale nuclear power plants. Even though Rochester continuously searched for the weakness of Su’s will, he wasn’t worried about his victory. Su’s size was too small, in any type of superior energy reserve technology, without enough size, the amount of energy that could be stored would always be limited. Meanwhile, as another ultra life form, Rochester’s energy reserves were not much lower than Su’s. Even if the efficiency was a bit lower, they were still on the same level of standard. Rochester’s size, was more than a hundred times that of Su’s.\\n\\n However, no matter how he thought about it, he never would have imagined that Su already possessed the ability to obtain energy from space. As long as the expenditure didn’t exceed the threshold, Su could continue almost limitlessly.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-37-11","bookId":1500,"book":{"id":1500,"title":"Demon Hunter","description":"---\\n Following the nuclear warfare, massacre extended towards the entire world.
