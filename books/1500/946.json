No one knew who it was that who first spoke this quote, but it had always been passed down, all the way into the era of turmoil, and it was something that more and more high level ability users approved of. For Helen, this line was completely the truth.\\n\\n In the eyes of others, Helen was almost omniscient. A few years ago, perhaps because she was still young, perhaps because the situation was too calm, Helen, at that time, was still obscure and unknown, someone only a few people in certain fields knew about. She, who only knew how to quietly research, was more often viewed as Persephone’s good friend, a rather capable cold-blooded doctor, and a woman with not even half a point of appeal. Back then, Persephone’s brilliance illuminated almost all of Dragon City, at the center of this brilliance was an imperceivable shadow, Helen hiding precisely at the center of it, so there was no way others would pay attention to her. Even if it was the current Dragon City, aside from a small few, for example, Lafite and Curtis who had remained at Helen’s side this entire time, there still weren’t many who paid attention to Helen. A woman without any abilities, in this era, was like a small white flower in a violent storm, about to be ravaged at any moment.\\n\\n However, in Lafite and Curtis’ minds, Helen was mysterious and powerful. Whenever they thought of her, it was as if they were standing at the top of a great mountain, before them clouds and sea, behind them an abyss, the fear and trepidation they felt something they had never experienced before. Only during Blood Dusk did the Spider Empress make them feel something similar. Moreover, as members of the few powerful ability users of this entire generation, the two strong men would actually obtain a sense of security from Helen’s side! Whenever they saw Helen’s busying figure, they would feel a mysterious feeling of ease. Even Lafite who almost killed his comrade and forced himself on Helen, when he looked at Helen, he found it difficult to produce any desire. When he was forcibly subdued at his moment of eruption, his lust was almost completely extinguished. Whenever he thought back to the past events, Lafite would always develop a growing sensation that from start until now, everything he had displayed had already previously appeared in Helen’s expectations. This type of feeling was extremely terrible, making Lafite feel as if everything he did was within the other party’s control, producing within him a powerful and undisguisable fear. Whenever he thought of this, Lafite would discover that when he faced Helen, it was extremely difficult for him to even produce a normal erection. It was to the extent where when he observed Helen, he would inadvertently wonder if Helen already anticipated his current thoughts, these thoughts emerging even when he looked at Helen’s chest or bottom. If this continued, how was Lafite supposed to produce any appetite?\\n\\n In the central laboratory, Helen was currently busying about on the experiment stage, on the counter before her a large pile of mechanical bug remains. Helen wore a pair of special microscopic glasses, in her hands a multi-functional dissection mechanical arm, currently dismantling the mechanical bugs bit by bit, even the smallest part divided into several pieces. Only when she was perfectly clear about all of their internal composition did she stop. As the mechanical bugs were dissected and analyzed one after another, a science and technology tree was currently continuously being completed in Helen’s mind, taking form. Whenever a mechanical bug was cut apart, a branch would be added to this tree, making it increasingly luxuriant.\\n\\n From these mechanical bugs’ bodies, Helen already vaguely saw the path to a completely new technological civilization. As for reverse engineering skills, Helen had almost no competition. These were accomplishments that made one’s heart pound; the mechanical bugs not only brought new materials, new sources of power, and new composition, they represented a type of direction, as well as the application of artificial intelligence. However, Helen couldn’t produce the slightest trace of excitement, instead displaying more calmness, as well as a bit of fear. This technology tree, for some reason, always gave Helen a strange sense of familiarity, to the extent where even if she didn’t rely on the mechanical bugs’ reverse engineering, she felt like she could still complete this entire technology tree. This technology tree, in reality, could have been unearthed a long time ago, yet Helen never touched upon this domain. When she thought back, it unexpectedly seemed like she subconsciously avoided this field! It wasn’t beyond her power, but rather that this domain hid a secret, a secret even the mechanical and ice-cold her wanted to avoid.\\n\\n After analyzing two more mechanical bugs, Helen lowered the dissection arm in disappointment, removed her glasses, and then organized her blonde hair. Only now did Helen discover that cold sweat had already soaked through her clothes, the damp and sticky feeling indescribably uncomfortable. She walked to the freezer cabinet with large steps, produced a glass of ice water, and then gulped it down. The cold water moved down her throat, entering her stomach like a stream of ice, and only then did she feel slightly better.\\n\\n Helen found a chair to sit down on, and then closed her eyes, using her hands to continuously rub her temples, releasing a light sigh. She suddenly sensed something, and as such, she opened her eyes, seeing Snow curled up by her feet, a pair of compound eyes currently looking at her.\\n\\n “Mama, are you in a bad mood?” Snow transmitted this message through its consciousness.\\n\\n Helen originally wanted to say ‘I feel perfectly fine!’, but after thinking for a bit, she still decided to tell Snow. “You’re right, Mama encountered an extremely troublesome matter. There is a high chance that… soon, Mama won’t be able to take care of you anymore.”\\n\\n Snow looked towards those mechanical bugs, seemingly understanding something, and as such no longer pursued the issue. It remained silent for a moment, and then finally set its resolution, raising its head to look at Helen. In an extremely serious manner, it asked, “Mama, who is my paternal parent?”\\n\\n Helen’s body trembled slightly, subconsciously saying, “You don’t have a father…”\\n\\n However, Snow didn’t react to this, still quietly looking at Helen, waiting for an answer. Helen sighed, but she still persisted, saying, “Snow, you were made with Mama’s genes as the main body, with some foreign genes added. That is why you are my child, but strictly speaking, you don’t have a father at all…”\\n\\n Snow quietly laid there.\\n\\n Snow and Helen stared at each other for three whole minutes, and only then did she shift her gaze. She pulled over a light screen, tapped on it, and then brought the light screen before Snow, saying, “He is precisely your paternal parent.”\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-32-1","bookId":1500,"book":{"id":1500,"title":"Demon Hunter","description":"---\\n Following the nuclear warfare, massacre extended towards the entire world.
