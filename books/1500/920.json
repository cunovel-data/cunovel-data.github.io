We will definitely win!” O’Brien laughed, and then patted Eileen again, saying, “Bevulas and Old William couldn’t send me to the land of death a few months ago, and now, there is even less of a chance that’ll happen. This battle before us, we have already won. That lunatic Gardner is nothing more than a clown, no matter how crazy he is, he still cannot stir up anything too crazy. We’ve already made it this far, do you still have no faith in us?” While saying this with a smile, a resolute and unyielding tone sprung up.\n If this was in the past, O’Brien who was fond of the arts wouldn’t laugh so boldly, only, when one remained long enough in blood and flames, one would inevitably become more decisive and unyielding. Someone like him had had to make near instantaneous choices of life and death, so he naturally lost his previous melancholy and moodiness, the emotions of hesitation and worry. However, when he laughed like this, Eileen suddenly cried out in alarm, holding him down, because laughing like this made his chest rise and fall violently!\n A feeling of powerlessness suddenly transmitted from within his body, preventing O’Brien from continuing his laughter, the latter half of it immediately crammed in his throat. When he sensed his body’s abnormalities, O’Brien calmed his breathing, and then asked, “The heart ruptured again?”\n “Yes, can you… can you not act so excited?” Eileen’s voice was a bit strange. She tore open O’Brien’s chest again, her ten fingers indescribably agile as they treated his heart.\n O’Brien had a large heart, this term used often in the olden era’s federation to describe someone with a steady mind. O’Brien not only had a resolute will, his heart was also large in itself, occupying almost half of his thoracic cavity. This was the source of all of his magic abilities, but only half of his heart remained, the other half’s damaged areas all patched up with various types of bio-materials, newly grown tissues, and even steel fiber-like objects. Right now, a large area of the padding was torn, thick blood currently slowly pouring out from the damaged area. When it made contact with the air, it immediately turned into dense bloody mist that slowly rose. This blood contained energy, so once it was exposed, it would immediately evaporate, what was lost actually O’Brien’s own energy.\n Eileen’s ten fingers moved lightly over his injuries, slowing the blood loss. Then, under the stimulation of her energy, the tissues around the heart grew frantically, wriggling flesh buds filling in the damaged areas, and then mutually intertwined, thus finally blocking up the damage. The treatment this time, at this point, completed the final crucial point. Eileen’s complexion was a bit pale, her body feeling drained, the lack of energy giving her an extremely terrible feeling, even keeping her eyes open difficult. For high level ability users, especially someone like her who already touched upon the gate of eleven levels, energy was like drugs, once too much was used, the withdrawal would be even worse than drug addiction.\n However, she still endured this, closing and sealing up the injury at O’Brien’s chest, and only then did her body go limp, laying down at his side. O’Brien turned around, looking at Eileen’s side profile. She was already asleep, her medium length blonde hair casually fallling onto the ground, completely unaware that it was now already contaminated by a lot of earth. This was an extremely beautiful woman, now already no longer paying attention to any details of life. She directly laid on the earth that was still releasing smoke, completely not minding her clothes, hair, and even body getting dirty, moreover able to sleep at ease in any place. Eileen’s skin was slightly dark, also no longer having its former radiance, the long scar on the side of her face ruining her beautiful appearance. However, these weren’t all the changes that happened to her, even though her stamina was completely spent, she still gave off a faint intimidating pressure, the embodiment of powerful strength. During the continuous battles, Eileen similarly grew at astonishing speed. However, in the past, all of her energy was focused on destruction, regardless of whether it was the enemy or herself. However now, she could change the berserk energy into wisps of life energy, using this to rescue and protect life. From the treatment procedure, one could see that Eileen already wasn’t inferior to any doctor. Meanwhile, the one who experienced this to the greatest extent was O’Brien. The steel wiring and fiber pieces that patched his injured heart were his own work, while all of the biological tissues were Eileen’s doing. From only understanding destruction to being able to provide treatment, the amount of time this transformation took was only a few months.\n O’Brien released a light sigh. Only, this slight sound already roused the sleeping Eileen awake. When she opened her eyes, she immediately saw O’Brien’s gray and green eyes. She suddenly woke up, raising her head to look at the injury on his chest. However, shortly after, Eileen already completely woke up. Her perception expanded, sensing everything related to O’Brien. When she looked into O’Brien’s eyes again, Eileen seemed to have seen something different in them, yet she couldn’t quite put her finger on it. Only, when she thought of O’Brien declaring that the war was about to be won, her mind suddenly trembled, her thoughts unavoidably shifting to another direction. They dealt with Gardner, defeated the chairman’s army’s main force, so this war should be considered finished. Bevulas naturally had the Spider Empress to deal with, not something on a level they should be dealing with.\n Eileen was an extremely intelligent woman. She knew that the turning point of the war had already appeared, which meant that the end wasn’t far.\n She hesitated for a bit, but in the end, still said, “O’Brien, when this war ends, let’s just complete the agreement between us.”\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-29-4","bookId":1500,"book":{"id":1500,"title":"Demon Hunter","description":"---\n Following the nuclear warfare, massacre extended towards the entire world.
