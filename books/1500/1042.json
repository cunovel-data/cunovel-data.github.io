He swallowed the bloody chunks with difficulty, gasping as he said, “Fast is also fine, end everything sooner… and rest.”\n He laid down on his back, temporarily losing even the strength to speak. Meanwhile, his hand was continuously moving about, seemingly searching for something. After searching for a long time without any returns, his face revealed an anxious expression. Su was moved, seeing a dark skinned book several meters out, Revelation. Su walked over, picking up Revelation, and then squatted down at the priest’s side, placing it into the priest’s hands.\n When he touched the familiar Revelation, the priest’s expression clearly became much more at ease, to the extent where a rosy color returned to his face. He caressed Revelation lovingly, and only after some time did he release a sigh, returning this book to Su, saying, “This! This is… what I felt, what I experienced for the past few decades, perhaps it can bring you some help in the future, perhaps it won’t . This time… will I truly die?”\n Su remained silent for a moment, and only then did he say, “There is a chance. The chance of waking up in the short term isn’t great.”\n “You mean there is no chance! You actually know how to console me, it really is unexpected. Could it be that the effects if the will of this world on you are also this strong… Destroyer?” The priest said.\n Su laughed, and then said, “Obviously. However, I am no Destroyer, my name is Su.”\n “No, you are clearly the Destroyer, or else how could Alphonse and the others appear? It is just that you are not willing to admit it right now. However… for the Destroyer to appear when I am still alive, this truly is inconceivable. At the very least, in the lord’s order, this shouldn’t have happened. That is why this truly is a wondrous world, the will of the world here also quite amazing. Actually… even if I can wake up again, so what? The one who awakens will be the creator, and not me anymore… reluctance to leave, this should also be a part of the will of this world, right?”\n Right at this time, a world-shaking roar of anger suddenly sounded from the skies. Quque screamed in pain, its mountain range-sized body gradually leaning to the side, slowly falling. Its falling speed didn’t look that fast, but when its body touched the ground, the earth would shake intensely, making it hard for one to stand still.\n As he looked at that struggling mountainous body, the priest released a deep sigh. He closed his eyes, two streaks of tears slowly falling, muttering to himself, “Quque, and also White… this is also fine, it’s fine, just let them sleep for a bit.”\n “Do you… have anything else you wish to say?” Su asked. He didn’t know why he would ask this question either.\n “Eliminate the apostles…” As soon as he said this, the priest couldn’t help but laugh, saying, “You would do this even if I didn’t say anything. Those apostles have already begun the planet’s purge, wiping them out is our most basic instinct. Apart from this, there is something you need to be careful of, they call it the perfect body. If there is a chance, eliminating the perfect body might be of even greater importance than eliminating the apostles. My intuition tells me that the perfect body is the most terrifying enemy.”\n “Perfect body… okay, I understand. Is there anything else?” Su nodded. The priest’s conversation with Su wasn’t as simple as what it seemed like on the surface. When the perfect body was mentioned, the priest already attached all information he had on this word. At this time, what he used was also the Bisindle divine language, even though before Su, the priest’s usage of the divine language was still simple and crude.\n The priest raised his hand with difficulty, pointing towards the sky. A map appeared on his fingertips, his finger pointing right on one area. “In this place, there is a girl called Sally who is currently working hard to carry out her dream. She isn’t beautiful, nor is she strong, but she is more pure than any human, more innocent, and harder working. If there is a chance, how about you leave her with some land to complete her dream? Even if you also wish to purge this place, you still don’t need to mind the few people here. This bit of life cannot maintain the will of the world, and after the will of the world disappears, they won’t be able to survive for long either.”\n “Sally…” Su thought of her, recalling that girl who danced erotically to exchange for money, using this to learn many things in Dragon City. The past her was still extremely young. With the wilderness’ standard, she had just matured, yet she danced while shedding tears.\n “Alright, I promise you.” Su didn’t hesitate at all when giving his reply.\n The priest gave Su a deep look, and then said with a sigh, “If it wasn’t for the battle just now, I really would doubt if you were the Destroyer… its is time, I should depart.”\n The priest’s voice gradually weakened, blood also no longer flowing, instead releasing strands of white smoke from his body’s injuries. In the mist, the priest’s body gradually evaporated, in the end disappearing without a trace. If it wasn’t for the crystallized battlefield that was left behind, the two mountainous corpses in the distance, as well as Bierlus who was still floating in the air, still in a panicked state, one couldn’t tell that there was a person like the priest who previously appeared here at all.\n Su stood up, wind blowing into his face, the scene extremely bleak. He looked around him. Just now, the battle scattered the clouds of radiation, which was why the sky was extremely high, the stars seeming like they were right in front of him, yet were also extremely far. In this space that suddenly became large, a single existence, even Su, would feel a strange lonesomeness.\n Without the priest, the world seemed to have suddenly become cold. Even though this was the first time Su met the priest, it was in unexpected circumstances. In the lord’s order, the Destroyer and Creator were like two sides of a coin, closely related, yet could never meet.\n Su gave Revelation in his hands a look, casually flipping through it. Every page had been carefully read through. As the winds blew past, the pages quickly flipped about. When the wind stopped, what appeared before Su was a rare clean page, on it a striking line:\n “The lord is omnipresent. When you think of him, he will appear.”\n Su released a light sigh, not knowing what he was feeling all sentimental over either, just that this mysterious feeling of melancholy was impossible to get rid of. The Revelation in his hands began to burn, in the end, not even a bit was left behind, just like the priest’s final end.\n A spark flickered in the limits of the horizon again. A scouting bug that was hiding in the distance exploded, the burning remains suddenly appearing before Su, and then falling on the ground with a pa noise. Su kicked the metal remains that were still burning, his expression gradually becoming ice-cold. If it wasn’t because of these apostles, why would he have reached the way he was today? If it wasn’t for them, why would Li die, why would Madeline’s whereabouts be unknown?\n If it weren’t for them, this world originally could have been an extremely peaceful one.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-40-9","bookId":1500,"book":{"id":1500,"title":"Demon Hunter","description":"---\n Following the nuclear warfare, massacre extended towards the entire world.
