Past the beach, were large amounts of scorched earth, lacking all biological auras. While looking at this expanse of deathly stillness, the priest revealed a bit of anger. He stood there quietly, eyes slowly sweeping across the scorched earth. At this time, the sound of water splashing about sounded, the puppy jumping out from the waves. It forcefully shook its body, sending water droplets everywhere, and only then did it stand by the priest’s feet. It also raised its head, gazing into the distant night sky. In that direction, the fiery light of explosions still flickered from time to time, signs of surviving mechanical units falling. The puppy released a few low roars from its throat, all of its mottled fur gradually standing up.\\n\\n The priest gazed into the distance, line of sight passing the battlefield in the distance, landing on the three mountain range-like giant shadows resting tens of kilometers out; these were the three quietly resting Stupas. Meanwhile, when the priest saw them, he also sensed a fourth powerful consciousness moving about in the air, and as a result, the anger on his face turned into the bitter smile hanging from the corners of his mouth. He said to himself, “Alphonse, Bierlus, and Quque, turns out the three of them were all here, no wonder I couldn’t find them. There is also a main brain, this really is troublesome! Little White, I only have you now, are you scared?”\\n\\n The puppy cried out twice in a firm manner.\\n\\n “If you aren’t scared, then that’s good.” The priest smiled as he patted the puppy’s head. Then, he still sighed, shaking his head and saying, “Three against one… sigh, Little White, this is still an impossible task. If I knew things were like this , I really should’ve called you out earlier. However, always hiding isn’t a solution, don’t you think?”\\n\\n The puppy cried out once more.\\n\\n The priest seemed to have understood the meaning it was trying to express. He nodded, and then produced the Revelation that had long become worn from being flipped through repetitively. He placed it before his chest, silently prayed, and a then a moment later, began to walk in the scorched earth’s direction. The moment the priest’s somewhat tattered leather shoes stepped on the great earth, the fourth great consciousness that continuously exchanged information suddenly became momentarily sluggish!”\\n\\n “Creator…”\\n\\n “Creator…”\\n\\n “Creator…”\\n\\n It was as if a trio ensemble sounded in the air, the moods the three different consciousness expressed entirely different. Alphonse was shocked, Bierlus serious, while Quque’s was a bit complex, even a bit confused. The Stupas had intelligence, their massive bodies allowing them to possess a brain that could support a larger body. Under many situations, Stupas could replace the main brain. Moreover, with their inherited memories, after their rebirth, it was as if they just slept for a bit.\\n\\n Alphonse’ current fighting strength dropped to less than half of its strength at its peak, so it immediately developed thoughts of running. However, with its massive body, if it wanted to run, it could only jump into outer space. Meanwhile, Bierlus seriously calculated the results of a battle with the creator, moreover already linking up with the main brain. As for Quque, its intelligence was even higher than that of its two companions, but oftentimes, wisdom that was too complex would instead be a type of hindrance. It was the only Stupa who noticed Little White, and it also felt confusion towards this. Little White gave off an extremely familiar aura, yet it couldn’t say where exactly it encountered it before. Moreover, the impression Little White gave it was that it couldn’t be overlooked, yet it wasn’t an existence that could pose as its opponent either.\\n\\n The main brain was silent. In that instant, the sea of information the three Stupas transmitted all pertained to the sixth apostle, the creator, as well as the Stupas’ own information. The amount of information was just this great, the main brain immediately feeling as if it was going to start burning. This wasn’t the first time it felt like it wasn’t large enough, but the feeling had never been this strong. Even if this entire planet ended up being devoured by it, it would still feel as if it wasn’t quite large enough.\\n\\n The priest gently caressed Revelation in his hands, his body also producing an extremely great consciousness, smashing straight into the Stupas’ consciousness in the sky!\\n\\n “Call your master out!” The priest said like this.\\n\\n “Perhaps there won’t be a need.” Bierlus said. It opened its giant mouth, one could see energy radiance continuously moving within the depths of its throat.\\n\\n The priest moved his head to look at Bierlus, saying with a smile, “But you aren’t my opponent. I obviously wouldn’t mind killing you first, this way, your master will similarly appear. However, if this happens, there will be a stupid record left in your memories. You should still just call out your master.”\\n\\n Bierlus lowered its head slightly, several dozen eyes all staring at the priest. “I am obviously not enough myself. However, there are three of us. Even if Alphonse only has half his energy left, it is still enough.”\\n\\n The priest smiled. “But I also have Little White.”\\n\\n The puppy released two forceful barks.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-40-6","bookId":1500,"book":{"id":1500,"title":"Demon Hunter","description":"---\\n Following the nuclear warfare, massacre extended towards the entire world.
