It represented the mechanical bug swarms that had just emerged from underground, currently being distributed while moving, ultimately splitting into more than twenty machine swarms that would be sent in different directions. The directions that the arrowheads were pointing towards, were mostly blind spots of information that were not illuminated yet. Due to the varying importance of missions, the sizes of the mechanical bug swarms also ranged from several hundred thousand to several million. This was a terrifying army this entire planet had never seen before!\\n\\n Wherever Serendela’s eyes passed, the Panoramic View would become brighter and more transparent. However, the blind spots that were like dark blotches stubbornly rejected her gaze, especially the Blood Parliament where the darkness was so thick it was as if it possessed substance. Serendela’s expression couldn’t help but become a bit ugly, and when her eyes passed over a certain dark spot, her face changed slightly. This was the Blood Parliament, and even as far as the entire human race’s restricted land, also the place the parliament used to lock up the most terrifying prisoners, the place where Lafite spent more than ten years in.\\n\\n While watching the first wave of bug tide disperse in all directions, Serendela slowly said, “Fitzdurk, are you sure this is what we must do?”\\n\\n “My dear Serendela, have you not seen yourself? The first wave of purging bug tide has already set off. They are the overture for purging the entire planet. When they are completely used up, an estimated over 90% of the great continent will be cleansed. At that time, our second wave, and even third wave army will be finished, and they will completely wash away the obstinate filth. The only regretful thing is that the spatial structure here isn’t stable, three spatial furnaces already the limit of what this place can handle. If I add even one more, the entire planet might be ripped apart by the damaged space, moreover form a giant black hole here.” Fitzdurk replied.\\n\\n However, Serendela’s worries didn’t seem to lessen in the slightest. “No, I am not doubting your ability to create an army, but rather feel that this planet’s environment is extremely strange. It should have already completely sealed itself up several decades ago. Using the humans’ language to describe it, this has already become a sealed experimental station, all creatures evolving at impossible speeds, evolution processes that require hundreds of millions to over a billion years of time to complete have been condensed into a trifling few decades. This place is like a transparent experimental vessel, while all creatures have become white mice used for experimentation, all of them apart from us. Perhaps this is why we have become the target of all of the white mice’s attacks.”\\n\\n “This is indeed the case.” Fitzdurk expressed his agreement, but immediately afterwards, he said, “However, so what? No matter how strong white mice are, they will still be white mice. Meanwhile, we have already existed for an unimaginably long amount of time. Moreover, we must purge this place, only through this method can we find the brain that has likely still not awakened. Of course, if we can find the general, then that would be even better.”\\n\\n “Do we have to wipe them out? Is there no way we can… change our methods?” Serendela released a sigh. Both her current appearance and expression were those of a young human woman. “Even if they are originally only insignificant white mice, some of them have already become powerful individuals that can threaten us, there is no way this is something you are not aware of. Instead of taking risks like this, why don’t we just concentrate our power on breaking free of this prison and head into the cosmos’ depths? With Valhalla and my power, we can definitely break free from this imprisonment. Then…”\\n\\n “Then what? Flee until we reach the edge of the universe? Your plan doesn’t sound bad, with Valhalla’s completion degree, short distance spatial leaps can still be accomplished. Then, would the two of us spend several tens of thousands, or perhaps hundreds of thousands of years of time in the darkness? Ah, I forgot, there is also the sword, we are not two, but three companions. She will wake up again in another hundred years or so at most, if we really are too lonely, I can forcefully wake her, only, that type of method… might make her feel unwell. However, Madeline shouldn’t mind it, because we are true comrades.” Fitzdurk said with a tone of mockery.\\n\\n “What’s wrong with this? Isn’t this fine?” Serendela retorted. In the apostle’s division of labor, Fitzdurk’s peak fighting ability was the worst, but in return, he had incomparable universal space adaptive ability, as well as intelligence second only to the brain. The latter was supposed to be Serendela’s domain, but due to certain unknown reasons, Serendela yielded this position. It wasn’t because Fitzdurk insisted on it, but instead purely because of her own weakness.\\n\\n Fitzdurk clearly understood this point, and as such, he released a sigh and said, “Serendela, you are less and less willing to use your thought centers. If this continues, you will be encumbered by your human body, your method of thinking will become as stupid as humans. Don’t tell me you never considered that with just us three, without the brain here, that everything is completely useless? Flee? Where would we be able to flee to? And how long can we run for? Hundreds of thousands, millions, or is it hundreds of millions of years? Are we going to just drift through eternal darkness like insignificant bugs? This is the ultimate conclusion you wish for?”\\n\\n Serendela thought for a bit. Right now, her speed of thinking, from an apostle standard, was intolerably slow, and even more so couldn’t compare to Fitzdurk’s who simultaneously controlled mechanical bugs in the tens of millions. However, she struggled to think, and then with ordinary human speech, said, “I can endure it.”\\n\\n “You can endure it?!” Fitzdurk laughed coldly. “Just because you can endure it, you think we can endure it? Or is it to say that we have to accompany you and endure it?! Serendela, you can stick yourself in a pig-like body, but please don’t think with that pig-like brain! Even if you constructed just a few thought centers, you wouldn’t raise such a foolish question. I truly want to help you restore your apostle instincts.”\\n\\n “Feel free to try, if you can accept all of the consequences.” Serendela still spoke through her own method, but this time, the contents contained a type of hidden viciousness.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-32-11","bookId":1500,"book":{"id":1500,"title":"Demon Hunter","description":"---\\n Following the nuclear warfare, massacre extended towards the entire world.
