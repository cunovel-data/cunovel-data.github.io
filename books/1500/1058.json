Although this journey has not been particularly long, it has been one with great emotions and memories. The characters were vivid and full of life, as if I knew each and every one of them myself. \\n\\n At first, the title Demon Hunter had always been a bit confusing to me. There were mutated and grotesque creatures of all different types and sorts, but as we delve further into the story, it becomes more and more apparent that the demons, oftentimes, laid within the human heart itself. Ambition and desire, whether it be for wealth, lust, or power is present in everyone, and to some extent, it is what makes us human. \\n\\n I would like to sincerely thank sovereignzane for always putting up with my last minute translations, Bumbum, Guy Smiley, and all the others from discord who selflessly contributed to the corrections of this novel. I am also deeply thankful towards all those who supported this novel, whether it was through subscriptions, or even just through positive comments on each chapter, it all means a lot to me. Lastly, I would like to thank RWX, without his support and encouragement, I wouldnâ€™t be where I am today.\\n\\n With this, I leave everyone with one final quote, one that beautifully summarizes this story:\\n\\n \"That is why everything returned to the start, the Lord will descend once more one day. Su, for the human race, for this planet, used his own life to stall the Lord for billions of years, while the human race would never learn their lesson. For the sake of their dreams, in the end, they would end up creating demons.\"\\n\\n Previous Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/dh-afterword","bookId":1500,"book":{"id":1500,"title":"Demon Hunter","description":"---\\n Following the nuclear warfare, massacre extended towards the entire world.
