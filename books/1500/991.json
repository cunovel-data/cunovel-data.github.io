Hundreds of thousands of mechanical combat units were transferred from other regions, moreover gathering to this side. The entire process was flowing and natural, just like two streams gathering. The bug swarm’s flow suddenly became extremely complex and varied, but the mechanical bugs flying about never ran into each other, the intensity of attacks towards the surface even more so not decreasing in the slightest. That was why in the beginning, the mechanical bug swarm that flew about above the private hospital’s skies only became slightly more concentrated. Right at this time, a burst of concentrated gunshot sounds suddenly rang out, the muffled rumbling noise even audible from far away. Following the gunshot sounds, the bug swarm above the private hospital had an entire layer shaved off, the fragmented high energy light beams already not posing much of a threat, at the very least not enough to destroy this place for a bit of time. Snow was a bit surprised, looking in the direction where the gunshot came from. Her perception passed over the smoke and flames, locking onto a five floor building several hundred meters out. In the blazing ruins, this small building and the surrounding buildings were completely undamaged, appearing extremely striking. Snow never expected things to turn out like this, catching her unprepared, her perception already covering Josh Morgan’s body. She obviously knew what kind of person General Morgan was, her perception immediately withdrawing as soon as it stretched over. However, this still drew General Morgan’s attention. He lowered the Bahamut’s muzzle, looking towards the private hospital, returning to the platform at almost the same time as Snow’s retreating perception. “Turns out to be this little fella…” General Morgan muttered to himself, suddenly chuckling in Snow’s direction. In that instant, he was more like a kind elder, and not the past ruthless dragonrider general. Snow obviously ‘saw’ Morgan’s smile, and also felt the elder’s mysterious enthusiasm and kindness, even though this was extremely difficult for her to understand. However, the bug swarm in the sky already began to gather, so there wasn’t any more time for her to think too much. A sharp screaming sound began to sound from a low altitude. A group of mechanical combat units unexpectedly dove down from the sky, using their own bodies to take the place of miniature guided missiles! This was the second time the mechanical bug swarm changed their offensive tactics since the start of the war, switching from long distance bombardment to close range tangling. Snow was also shocked, but she obviously wouldn’t object to close combat. As a result, she sharpened her blades, waiting for the slaughter fest to arrive. “1036 of them, it seems like it’ll be a bit tiring to deal with.” While Snow thought this, she was actually a bit excited. The distant gunshots suddenly became more rushed, the barrage of bullets cutting off the mechanical bugs’ follow-up, but it was only temporary. The mechanical bug swarm gathered extremely quickly, definitely not something a single Bahamut could stop, not even a Bahamut in Morgan’s hands. Snow already jumped off the balcony, starting to glide through the air. Her flight method was incredibly strange, as if she wasn’t affected by gravity or inertia at all, to the extent where even with the mechanical units’ calculation ability, there were still many errors, the high energy light beams all missing. Meanwhile, Snow already threw herself into the mechanical bug swarm, screeching metal grinding sounds unending, large amounts of combat units dismembered into metal scrap. Unknowingly when, a consciousness appeared in the mechanical bug swarm’s command information stream. It remained quiet when Snow quickly chopped up more than a thousand mechanical units, and then it rose to the highest level of command, directly giving the order, “Continue the testing, double the numbers.” A small group separated from the mechanical bug swarm again, rushing towards Snow who had just dismembered her final opponent. The gunshots in the distance never stopped, so when the mechanical bug swarm that had their number viciously reduced reached Snow, there were only two thousand left, perfectly double that of the first time. “A bit difficult…” This was what Snow thought when she was down to the last dozen combat units. She felt a bit tired, a few joints releasing extremely faint groaning sounds, reminding Snow that they already experienced wear and tear, needing to be replaced with new parts. However, repairing damaged limbs required an entire day of time, how could Snow afford such a luxury? “Continue the testing, double the numbers.” An ice-cold order was passed along the mechanical bug swarm’s stream of information again. Not far out, General Morgan suddenly frowned. His Bahamut already reached its maximum firing rate, yet it could only remove a thin layer from the dark cloud of mechanical combat units rushing down. Moreover, the mechanical bug swarm’s numbers also left him feeling rather uncomfortable. A thousand, two thousand, and then four thousand, could it be that the master behind the mechanical bug swarm already included his own shooting into his calculations? Regardless of whether it was one thousand or four thousand, for Snow, the difference wasn’t that great, it was only a problem of the length of time exhausted, as well as the degree of wear and tear of certain parts of her body. “Continue the testing, double the numbers.” Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-36-3","bookId":1500,"book":{"id":1500,"title":"Demon Hunter","description":"--- Following the nuclear warfare, massacre extended towards the entire world.
