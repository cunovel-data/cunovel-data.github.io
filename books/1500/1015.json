In that place, he discovered an unknown blood descendant. The reason he discovered it, was because someone took action to erase the summoning he released towards his own descendants. This type of summoning was mysterious and complex, even in ultra life forms, it was extremely rarely seen. Even if they were separated by countless star systems, they could still perceive each other, moreover call descendants back to one’s side. The only exception, was if the descendant’s power already exceeded the paternal body’s, only then would there be a chance of resisting the summoning.\\n\\n The summoning’s reasoning was unclear, the use of it also currently unknown, but just like other abilities, it was also a type of powerful ability hidden deep within the bloodline instincts, just awakening.\\n\\n However, there was actually someone who could erase Su’s summoning?\\n\\n Even so, this wasn’t what Su was truly worried about, but rather, why was there a third descendant? Who was it, and who was the mother?\\n\\n Su moved, seemingly wishing to immediately fly to the northern continent, but he still endured it. The mountain belly had already been completely changed, below it a clear lake, countless egg clusters of varying sized floating inside of it. Meanwhile, where Rochester’s body originally remained, there was a new brain quickly growing. It continuously squirmed about, already reaching several dozen cubic meters in size, yet was still growing. Inside of the brain, countless thought centers were currently forming. Even though every single thought center’s function was only one hundred thousandth that of Su’s third class centers, the amount concentrated far exceeded this multiplier, and maintenance was simple and easy, not as high as the third class thought centers. This brain’s development didn’t have a limit, if it obtained enough goods and nutrients, it could even grow to a size larger than a planet.\\n\\n Main brain, high level biological weapon, its own combat strength was close to zero, but it was the nucleus and center of the biological weapons. It used its massive calculation abilities to command biological weapon troops, able to make decisions on wars across an entire star system. If one were to say that biological weapons relied more on quantity to win, then with the main brain, they would become a terrifying war machine that was strict and precise, able to maximize the destructive force of every detail. The use of the main brain would only be at its greatest when commanding a great army.\\n\\n Outside battles, Su could also use the main brain’s massive calculation ability to carry out all types of analysis and computing. To analyze the tremendous amount of information Rochester left behind, it would take at least a few decades of time, but as the main brain grew, the entire process could be shortened to just a few years, several months, or even a few days.\\n\\n This bit of time, Su could still wait for. Either way, before returning to the northern continent, he had to meet his own children. Those little fellas, they were definitely already terrified badly, right? As for the third child, and her mother, Su already roughly knew who they were. When the calculation ability reached a certain degree, it was equivalent to increasing one’s intelligence to a certain degree. Even if there were ten million possibilities in this world, before a calculation base in the millions and millions, an answer could still be found near instantly.\\n\\n Those little fellas, they were definitely already terrified badly, right? Su once again thought this in a rather relaxed matter, but those little fellas definitely weren’t relaxed at all.\\n\\n When Snow woke up, she was already no longer within her mother’s warm embrace, but rather surrounded by ice-cold walls. Her powerful instincts told her that it was already afternoon of the second day, but because she was in the basement, it was completely dark around her. Even though it was absolutely dark, Snow could still see everything around her, no different than if it was daytime. Her compound eyes far exceeded all perception organs of this era, whether there was light or not making no difference. Snow didn’t fear the cold, nor did she fear the darkness, but right now, in her mother’s laboratory, she was scared to the point where she couldn’t feel any more terrified.\\n\\n Why did she end up sleeping this long?! Snow didn’t know the answer to this at all. She only knew that the deadline for her paternal body’s summoning was almost reached, while no matter what she did, there was no way she could reach the southern continent within the designated time, not even flight was enough. What was the result of not obeying her paternal body’s summoning? Snow did not know. However, she knew that if her paternal body was angry, then the consequences would definitely be extremely severe. If her paternal body came to harm her mother, then what? What could she do? Before her paternal body, even moving was extremely difficult for Snow.\\n\\n Snow was so nervous she was about to go crazy. She abandoned all other thoughts, releasing a shrill scream. The sound wave of this scream far exceeded the range of what the human ear could perceive, but it could contact her paternal body through her bloodline even if they were separated by several star systems. The information contained within was extremely short, but it was enough to express Snow’s intent, “I will be late, but I will definitely come. I won’t rebel, so please don’t harm mother.”\\n\\n Snow knew that her mother already erased her paternal body’s summoning from within her body, and it was because she was so greatly overwhelmed by fear that she remained unconscious until now. However, since she was already summoned, then what her mother did, how could her paternal body not know about it? If she were to say that before, she might be able to make it through by a fluke if she didn’t respond to the summoning, hoping that her paternal body wouldn’t find her, now that her mother did this, it was instead the same as giving her paternal body a clear set of coordinates. Not only was he now informed of her existence, but he now also knew where she was.\\n\\n That was why what Snow wanted to do now, was immediately hurry to her paternal body’s side. She knew that her own existence was actually a threat to her paternal body, as there were no familial feelings to speak of between ultra life forms, this was only a function low level creatures had towards survival. Meanwhile, when ultra life forms grew to the limit, they would even set star systems as their predatory domain.\\n\\n Snow immediately stood up, but when her little body just stood up, she suddenly lost strength, falling weakly onto the ground, unable to move anymore. She was immediately terrified badly, recalling immediately afterwards that aside from her mother, who understood her body this well, able to remove all of her strength? However, why did she do this? Could it be that her mother didn’t know that if she didn’t hurry to her paternal body’s side, it was difficult to say what would happen?\\n\\n Snow tried her best to stand up, but this weight that was normally light to the point where she didn’t feel anything now felt like it was a thousand pounds, to the extent where she couldn’t even support itself with her jointed limbs. She struggled frantically, already using all methods she could think of, yet couldn’t find any of the power she originally had. She even bit down on everything she could reach, trying to recover a bit of strength, but her teeth that could chew through the sharpest alloys now couldn’t even rip through a piece of fiber. Every part of her body had been meticulously prepared by Helen, so if she wanted to restrict her movements, it was a task that couldn’t be easier.\\n\\n Snow still wasn’t willing to give up, frantically struggling.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-38-4","bookId":1500,"book":{"id":1500,"title":"Demon Hunter","description":"---\\n Following the nuclear warfare, massacre extended towards the entire world.
