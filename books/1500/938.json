Meanwhile, on the other end of the room, Su was currently busily wiping and cleaning the floor. If they weren’t in the current era, this would be an extremely warm and ordinary family life scene. When Su finished busying about, Persephone released a yawn, and then said that she was tired, starting to walk towards the bedroom. Su carefully and meticulously completed the task at hand, and only when the entire room was without a speck of dust did he put everything away in satisfaction, also preparing to go to sleep. In the present where there was a shortage of energy, resting at sunset became the natural choice of many ordinary people once more.\\n\\n Right when Su walked towards the bedroom, there was a strange feeling that suddenly attacked his mind. Not too far away, he felt some type of vague feeling, a feeling similar to an intruder cell that left his body. Right now, Su’s perception was already extremely sharp, no longer blurry like in the past. When the feeling surfaced, he immediately traced it back to the source, already clearly sensing that some type of cell that ought to belong to him was rapidly reproducing, moreover currently being assimilated and controlled by another. The current Su was already different from the past. He took a few steps towards the door, and then stopped. He looked towards the bedroom, and then he withdrew his hand that reached out towards the door. Su cherished the present comfort and peace greatly. Even though he knew that this was only a fake happiness, he was still willing to prolong it even if by a minute. Su slowly calmed down his mood, only giving the direction that the feeling came from a cold laugh, and then engraved all of the distant feeling’s details into the depths of his heart.\\n\\n Placed by the entrance into the bedroom was a long mirror. Su walked past the mirror, and then suddenly stopped to look at himself in this mirror. Within the mirror’s reflection was an incredibly beautiful man, the depths of his green eyes deep to the point where no bottom could be seen, light golden loose hair scattering down. On Su’s body, the greatest level of beauty the human race could achieve had already been reached. The current Su, was even more pretty than his past self when he met Persephone for the first time that year. However, the past Su was still human, this was true regardless of whether it was from his body composition or genes, only his right eye wasn’t. Yet now, only his exterior appearance was human, everything else from his internal body composition to genes completely different. It was to the extent where Su’s genetic composition and structure started to deviate from the human race and other life on this planet.\\n\\n With eleven levels of perception, Su naturally understood his own body’s details like the back of his hand, to the extent where he could even sense the mysterious symbols within the depths of his right eye. Su didn’t wish to touch those symbols, because all power needed a price to be obtained. Meanwhile, Su had a feeling that using the knowledge and power stored within the symbols might cost him more than he could afford to pay.\\n\\n A uniform breathing sound could be heard from the bedroom, Persephone already fell asleep. As such, Su wasn’t in a rush to enter anymore, instead pushing open the living room window. The cold night wind passed in through the window, entering together with the wind was a forager.\\n\\n The forager’s outer appearance was a bit different from before, its body more slender and lanky, its skin a greenish black. Its back was covered in a row of venomous spikes and sharp scales. It could still fly, but it was now an anti-gravity organ that allowed it to travel a short distance. Its six jointed limbs allowed it to move quickly through all types of terrain, and they were also powerful attack weapons. This was a transformation the forager took the initiative to undergo to adapt to this planet’s environment.\\n\\n While looking at the forager, Su extended out his finger. A puppy-sized forager stood up on its hind legs, supported itself on Su’s finger, and then spat out a thumb-sized energy crystal from its mouth. After completing this, it turned around and leapt out, instantly disappearing into the boundless night. The crystal wasn’t large, but it was as if a flame was burning inside, radiance flickering without any pattern from within. Su could sense the tremendous energy stored within, to help visualize this, it was as if Su was holding a miniature nuclear reactor in his hands. This high energy crystal would be Su’s main food in the future. Meanwhile, its research value was inestimable, because this was the key that led to an energy civilization. However, after fiddling around with it a bit, he opened a somewhat rusted metal trunk from a corner of the living room, and then casually tossed the energy crystal inside. The moment the metal trunk was opened, a streak of seven-colored brilliance immediately rushed to the ceiling, the strong aura of energy able to instantly make an ordinary person’s heart explode and die. Excessively powerful energy only brought ordinary people fear, while for Su, it was a delicacy without equal. However, he didn’t give the metal trunk a single look, closing the lid just like that, cutting off the energy aura. The amount of energy stored within a single energy crystal produced by the forager exceeded the amount of energy contained within the food an ordinary person ate in his or her lifetime, yet this perfectly matched Su’s current constitution.\\n\\n However, Su would rather eat meals, especially the meals Persephone prepared.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-31-4","bookId":1500,"book":{"id":1500,"title":"Demon Hunter","description":"---\\n Following the nuclear warfare, massacre extended towards the entire world.
