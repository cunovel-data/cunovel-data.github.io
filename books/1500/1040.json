In front of them, the priest and Little White seemed even more insignificant, yet the three Stupas became more and more serious. However, they still didn’t call Su over, since either way, Su would know about everything that was happening here.\\n\\n The priest’s thick eyebrows raised, and he then said, “Not willing to call out your master? Then that’s fine, let’s just start. Either way, this planet similarly cannot support the existence of you three either. Just return to the lord’s embrace!”\\n\\n While speaking, the priest’s body gradually enlarged, stopping only when he reached ten meters in size. Meanwhile, Little White was barking continuously, the barks eventually becoming low growls. Its body also gradually became bigger, moreover becoming even larger than the priest’s, only stopping after reaching over thirty meters. However, its body changed again, continuously producing scales, its two claws also becoming several pairs of short feet. Its long tail brandished about, actually rising up with a bit of difficulty!\\n\\n “White!”\\n\\n “It’s White!”\\n\\n “Why is he by the creator, and not on our side?” The Stupas’ consciousness stream suddenly became intense. When the puppy turned into a miniature Supa, things were immediately much less fun.\\n\\n In the Stupas’ memories, they all knew that they had one more companion, a companion who also had a name. Its name was White, but they didn’t know why it never appeared. The Stupas never felt that this was surprising, in the past, it wasn’t like all of the Stupas would be summoned. It was because when a Stupa grew to its limit, it would become even larger than a planet. For a normal star system level civilization, a single Stupa was already enough.\\n\\n However, White appeared, yet didn’t stand at the same side as the three Stupas. This immediately made them feel that things were a bit problematic.\\n\\n However, the priest was waiting precisely for this moment of chaos. Electricity winded about his hands as he reached towards the sky, and then he gripped towards the void!\\n\\n Bierlus and Alphonse immediately felt their bodies sink, unexpectedly gradually being pulled towards the surface! Their bodies were a hundred thousand times bigger than the priest’s , yet they were pulled out of the sky towards the ground! Meanwhile, the priest was instead as steady as a mountain range!\\n\\n Bierlus and Alphonse released world-shaking roars, their massive bodies frantically moving. They continuously absorbed energy from the void, to the extent where faint black-colored ripples appeared all around them, a sign of space become unstable. The priest’s expression gradually reddened, his giant body long turning his clothes to shreds. As a result, one could see the muscles underneath his skin swelling, thick blood vessels winding about, as if they were going to pop out from his skin!\\n\\n With a pu sound, some of the priest’s blood vessels that were a bit thinner completely burst, the bloody mist that sprayed out instantly dyeing half the priest’s body red. However, the smile on his face remained unchanged, the power his hands released still gradually increasing. Bierlus continuously howled, firing energy light beams to attack. However, no matter how concentrated the energy light beams were, they disappeared without a trace when they reached ten meters from the priest’s body. In reality, Bierlus was only venting its anger, the true battlefield was the force field wrapped around itself. As long as Bierlus could break free from the force field’s restrictions, he could inflict serious injuries onto the priest. However, this type of battle was completely a battle of attrition, a comparison of energy, there was no leeway for anything else. Bierlus’ energy was completely subdued by the priest. Alphonse even more so cried out, full of unwillingness, because it was currently being dragged down meter by meter, moreover the speed becoming faster and faster. Once a Stupa was dragged back to the ground, it would signify that its anti-gravity organ was completely destroyed. At that time, the weight of its massive body alone would completely crush all of its interior composition, while the tissues that absorbed spatial energy would become fatal bombs, completely blast them to pieces. Alphonse was the weakest Stupa, and the priest concentrated two-thirds of his power on it, which was why its resistance was quickly weakening.\\n\\n The blood vessels on the surface of the priest’s body broke down one by one, the bloody mist that sprayed out not scattering for a long time, completely soaking him, turning him into a man of blood. The priest didn’t absorb energy from space, instead relying on continuously exploding his body’s tissues to produce energy. The destruction of matter would produce extremely powerful energy, to the extent where it could overwhelm the energy obtained from space, just that it couldn’t be continued for as long as spatially extracting energy. Alphonse’s mountain range-like body was already about to touch the ground. It released a crazy roar, giant tail smashing fiercely against the ground!\\n\\n The ground instantly split apart, earth, stone, and bloody mist rising up. A small half of Alphonse’s massive tail disappeared, the point of separation badly mangled. Borrowing the powerful recoil force, Alphonse finally rose up into the air again!\\n\\n The priest released an angry roar. The skin covering his right arm almost completely exploded, this time no longer spraying out bloody mist, but rather large amounts of sticky blood plasma! Then, Alphonse’s body suddenly doubled instantly. It released a miserable and angry howl, frantically struggling, but in the end, it still slowly fell towards the ground.\\n\\n While Bierlus and Alphonse fell into this desperate situation, Quque wasn’t that much better off, because its opponent was White.\\n\\n The thirty meters tall White’s nimbleness wasn’t something Quque could compare to at all. That was why when Quque opened its mouth, White charged in without any hesitation, the battlefield now being the inside of Quque’s belly. It wasn’t that Quque didn’t have any power to retaliate, it could produce many mini Stupas within its abdomen. Even though their individual strength couldn’t compare to White’s, their numbers were in the tens of thousands! White entering Quque’s body wasn’t something that could be helped, right now, it was already a planetary level weapon, based on the past standard, its main battlefield was on a galaxy level. Meanwhile, right now, White was a weapon within a planet, inside a planet, somehow, White’s combat strength far surpassed Quque’s. Moreover, between the four Stupas, White was also the only true ultra life form. Even if White only recently awoken, energy reserves almost completely empty, Quque still had to fight with everything it had.\\n\\n From the moment White entered its abdomen, Quque silently floated in the air, not moving at all.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-40-7","bookId":1500,"book":{"id":1500,"title":"Demon Hunter","description":"---\\n Following the nuclear warfare, massacre extended towards the entire world.
