This battle ended in the biological army’s defeat, the several hundred biological weapons completely killed, while the mechanical army paid the price of over ten thousand combat units to accomplish this. The large scale biological weapons flying in the back immediately transferred over the biological army from the back into the battlefield. A few minutes later, a battle erupted, the scope close to a hundred kilometers. Soon afterwards, the battle line extended to over a thousand kilometers, small troops from both sides fighting chaotically, fighting from the skies down to the earth, and then underground, the flames of war everywhere. The biological army numbering in the millions fought risking life and limb against mechanical units several times their own numbers. Energy, flames, and shock waves continuously ravaged the earth, not even the seeds with the smallest trace of life in the ground able to escape.\n After several days of time, the northern continent’s mechanical bug swarm crossed the ten million threshold again. Meanwhile, what the biological army was fighting against wasn’t limited to the mechanical army, on the boundless great sea, one could see giant steel ships moving one after another, even the smallest one among them exceeding the largest tanker ship of the olden era. The giant steel ship possessed a sleek exterior exceeding the technology of this era, as well as a completely sealed ship body, so it could enter the sea at any time. The underwater portions of the ship body opened frequently, releasing numerous underwater specialized combat units.\n The sea was currently roaring.\n The waves on the ocean surface had already reached the limit, shocking waves reaching several dozen meters into the sky constantly visible. The winds were also crazily howling, it removed over ten thousand tons of seawater, bringing it into the sky, and then sent it smashing down several dozen kilometers out. The clouds of radiation in the sky were roiling intensely, hanging so low they brushed the surging waves. This was an unprecedented vile weather, not even the nuclear-powered aircraft carriers of the olden era would dare to set out under this type of weather. However, for those giant steel ships that easily passed hundreds of thousands, and even over a million tons, even the most powerful waves only made them shake a bit more fiercely.\n Right above the steel fleet, a radiation cloud pillar suddenly descended, a new hurricane was actually developing here! This conical cloud pillar smashed accurately into this fleet, a giant ship at the eye of the winds suddenly moving, the two hundred thousand ton ship body actually slowly raised from the sea water! As this ship was about to be raised into the sky by the crazy winds, the surrounding steel giant ships all released energy sparks, energy force fields applied to this giant steel ship one after another, immediately stabilizing it. The hurricane was still howling, however, this time, all of the giant steel ships were linked up through the energy fields, so if it wanted to raise one giant ship, then the entire fleet had to be raised into the sky. This fleet exceeding ten million tons clearly exceeded the limits of what a natural hurricane could move.\n The crazier the winds, the more it couldn’t be maintained. The hurricane quickly exhausted its energy, slowly moving into the distance. When it scattered, the clouds of radiation in the skies already became a bit thinner, the ocean waves also becoming a bit calmer. The winds were still violent, but it could no longer reach the level of moving mountains and shifting seas. Meanwhile, the rain in the sky became much more concentrated, but unfortunately, this was instead like a drainage of some type of spatial weakness.\n The winds were crazy, waves fierce, this was the counterattack the will of this world could display at this time. In the olden era, this could destroy the most powerful ocean fleet, and it could level coastal cities, even destroy island nations. However, right now, it couldn’t do anything to these giant steel ships made with era-surpassing technology. The ships sped across the ocean surface with speeds close to a hundred kilometers an hour, three giant steel ships among them moving side by side, bringing up the rear of the fleet. The base of the ship revealed countless tiny holes, strands of ash gray smoke released into the sea. These streaks gradually sunk deep into the sea, moreover spreading extremely quickly. Not long after the fleet passed, the movements of the various fish species in the ocean depths suddenly became sluggish, and then shortly afterwards, they completely stopped moving, either rising to the surface or sinking. A moment later, the ocean regions the giant steel ships passed through already became death regions.\n What the giant steel ships released was a specially developed inorganic toxin, the toxicity more than a hundred times greater than any known poisons of this world. When a drop completely dispersed, it could kill all life forms within a square kilometer. Meanwhile, the giant steel ships’ ship body also continuously melted in the ocean, releasing another type of poison into the sea. This was a type of biological body similar to a virus, able to propagate limitlessly, fatal for almost all creatures, moreover able to use organic matter as food. They were a supplement to the inorganic poison, as well as more long term and meticulous killers, because this was something similar to biological bodies, yet not true living things, this type of poison couldn’t support the will of this world. As such, when their numbers became large enough, they would instead develop a type of effect similar to poison against the will of the world.\n What this unprecedentedly massive fleet spread across this great sea, was a deep scar of death. Apart from the southern continent which was rich with life, life in the northern continent was already close to eradication. Only the great sea was still rich with life, supporting the foundation of the will of this world. Right now, this fleet sent out by the apostles was precisely released to fully wipe out the life systems in the sea. In reality, even though the southern continent was still rich with life, biological weapons similarly couldn’t support the will of this world. That was why the biological army on the scale of tens of millions similarly delivered a heavy blow to the will of this world.\n Perhaps it was because the will of this world sensed this threat that it launched its dying counterattack, thus creating a disaster comparable to judgment day on every corner of this world. Only, these natural disasters that could wipe out the olden era human race, before the apostles’ era-exceeding civilization, appeared incredibly lacking.\n The southern continent was similarly engulfed in howling winds and torrential rain.\n Su raised his head within the curtain-like rain. He looked towards the horizon, already sensing something. He laughed coldly, saying to himself, “Things already reached this point, yet you guys are still playing tricks. Originally, if you guys ran, then that would’ve been that, but now… all of you can forget about leaving!”\n Strictly speaking, the four days Su had promised still had not been met, but he didn’t want to wait any longer. The apostles weren’t as intelligent and rational as he had thought, nor were they as proud and resolute, they were clearly taking advantage of the time Su gave them to speed up the purge of the world. If they really were given four days of time, perhaps they would really inflict irreversible harm onto this planet. From the will of the world’s violent reaction, the damage it suffered was already on the verge of being fatal...\n Su’s right eye flickered a few times, and then the signal he summoned his biological army with was already released. A moment later, the skies darkened, Bierlus’ mountainous body appeared in the horizon. It lowered its head slightly, lower jaw touching the ground, allowing Su to walk along its head, stand on its skull. While standing on Bierlus’ body, it was as if Su was standing on a mountain range’s summit, yet his aura was even more powerful than the Stupa’s.\n Bierlus released a cry, its voice transmitting far into the distance, the terrifying shockwaves even scattering the clouds of radiation in the sky. It forcefully moved about, its massive body slowly accelerating north.\n The Stupa was like a world destroying devil. It crossed over the great sea, passed over tall mountains, and then through the endless plains. By relying on its massive body’s unending energy supply, its speed reached an extremely shocking degree. It smashed through the bitterly fighting biological army and mechanical bug tide’s battle line, appearing before Valhalla.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-40-12","bookId":1500,"book":{"id":1500,"title":"Demon Hunter","description":"---\n Following the nuclear warfare, massacre extended towards the entire world.
