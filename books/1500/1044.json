His past flowed through his heart like water, every single person, every single event, every freeze frame of the events of his past, appeared right before his eyes. It was to the extent where even the memories of when he was only an aggregate of a few cells were restored. At that time, he moved around, seizing the food in his surroundings, including all types of other cells, bacteria, and even viruses. He grew slowly, carefully controlling his growth speed, moreover carefully choosing between many abilities that were ready to awaken. Then, due to fear towards danger, he sealed most of the abilities. This was definitely not a cellular level intelligence, to the extent where it far exceeded the human race’s level of intelligence; this wasn’t something that was impossible at all. At the center of the cells hid a Bisindle divine language symbol, its use precisely the analysis of the surrounding environment and supplying the most optimal evolutionary direction. Just like the other symbols, this Bisindle divine language character also possessed a structure that could be endlessly divided, as well as a sea of information, moreover the ability to select and choose for oneself. It was precisely this Bisindle symbol that determined that there might be hidden dangers in his surroundings, and thus warned Su from an instinctive level, affecting his behavior.\n Now, it seemed like the danger originated from Rochester’s laboratory. Su was already familiar with the human race’s customs, there were many reasons for the destruction of experimental subjects, for example, losing control over them, or if they were too dangerous. When a small clump of cells displayed evolution and growth speed tens of times that of other bacterium, moreover possessing unlimited growth possibility, no one was willing to see it leave the scope of microscopes and petri dishes. Once control was lost over the experimental subject, there was only destruction awaiting it. Meanwhile, at first, destroying the experimental body was extremely easy, for example, drying the petri dish over a stove would make even the most persistent cells enter a dormant state. Moreover, when the temperature was increased to a thousand degrees, without the protection of an energy layer, all of the cells would completely melt. If this happened, there wouldn’t be the later Su.\n For several dozen, or even just a few cells to possess intelligence exceeding the human race, this was a complete joke in the eyes of any human. Not even the awakened apostle Rochester thought of this point, and that was why Su was able to find the opportunity to escape in the end. This was just a small bit of carelessness by one of the researcher staff, not completely sealing the experimental body when working. At that time, the experimental body was nothing more than a small piece of flesh-like substance floating within culture fluid, the naked eye unable to differentiate its activity at all. That was why as it moved through its container, this researcher became a bit lazy, directly using his hand to remove the container, and then placed it into a completely sealed scanning device. However, precisely during this interval of less than a second of time, a particle bounced off the surface of the container, floated through the air, and then left the laboratory through the ventilation system, moreover using a large half of its body’s cells as the sacrifice to successfully leave the underground laboratory. The Bisindle divine language symbol was stored precisely within one of the cells.\n When the particle left the laboratory, the experimental body left in the container already truly turned into a piece of flesh. It could continue growing, but it no longer had a soul.\n Not long after the particle left, Rochester noticed the escape of experimental subject number one. At the time, the main reason why Su felt that time was a bit off was because the amount of time it took for Rochester to notice the escape of the experimental body was really too short. Su didn’t believe that olden era humans could detect a slight change on a cellular level, even less of a chance of them detecting the existence of the Bisindle divine language symbol. Only after learning that Rochester was an apostle were all of his questions answered.\n Even now, Su still didn’t know where the Bisindle symbol came from, or what kind of method it existed through. It wasn’t an energy body, nor did it occupy any space, yet it still existed just like that. Whenever Su’s strength increased to a new level, he would discover more of the divine language, while his understanding towards the symbols he already possessed would grow deeper. The acquiring of power was just this fast, to the extent where it filled Su with fear, moreover the greatest type of fear. Su didn’t know where this power ultimately led, but he knew that once it passed a certain threshold, there would be an irreversible change.\n On the third day, there were already large troops of biological creatures that passed over Su, flying north. Soon afterwards, a giant cylindrical biological weapon slowly moved past the sky, this giant fella that was five thousand meters long didn’t possess much fighting strength itself, but it was the mobile logistics hub of all of the biological weapons. The energy liquid it secreted could quickly replenish the energy for any biological weapon. Even though Su had said that he would wait four days for the apostles, the vanguard of the biological army had already set out.\n On the fourth day, the statue-like Su finally opened his eyes.\n The faces of the three apostles in Valhalla were all sunken, completely unable to tend to the fact that this expression was ridden with the will of this world. This time, Su made them understand that as long as he was on this planet, they could forget about trying to hide. Even though they didn’t know how Su found them, Su was clearly just like the creator, both having special methods of locating the apostles.\n The apostles couldn’t help but recall the Creator’s words before he left; when the Ccreator died, the seventh apostle, the Destroyer, would appear.\n The Creator was born specifically to destroy the apostles. He was named the Creator, his most powerful methods precisely a giant and powerful biological army, the cornerstone of this biological army precisely the four Stupas who possessed memories of the past. Before the Creator’s biological army, the apostles completely lost all superiority.\n Was Su the Destroyer? The so-called seventh apostle was something they learned of from the Creator’s mouth. The Destroyer would appear only after the Creator failed, and at that time, the apostles’ chances of victory would become even more fleeting, let alone the fact that they only had four apostles right now, the whereabouts of the brain still unknown. Just as Rochester, Fitzdurk, and Serendela were frowning, Madeline who was sitting on top of the warship lowered her head.\n In Dragon City, Persephone’s private hospital was already completely dark. The supply of electricity had already long been cut off, and it would never be replenished again. All of Dragon City’s energy was used to defend against the mechanical bugs that might appear at any time. Meanwhile, the Black Dragonriders were in chaos. General Morgan suddenly went missing, and no one else could take command over the general situation. There were no dragonrider generals left.\n In the private hospital’s underground laboratory, Helen sat in the darkness alone, not moving at all. If it wasn’t for her body still giving off heat, one would mistaken her for being a statue. In the darkness, there were still bits of faint light flickering, these were Snow’s eyes. Right now, she was extremely restless, no longer curled up in her original position, instead doing everything she could to escape. The cold chills that originated from deep within her soul shattered almost all of her willpower; this was a killing intent that originated from her paternal body. Even though it wasn’t directed at her, it still made Snow feel the deepest sense of danger. She really wanted to hide in Helen’s embrace, yet couldn’t. Helen had a metal box beside her, and the aura it released left it absolutely horrified. The fear that aura produced was almost identical to what it felt from its paternal body.\n Helen’s hands were ice-cold, her heart even colder.\n One of her worries, some time ago, had already silently broken apart. This wasn’t a feeling, but rather a time limit. When this line was passed, if Morgan didn’t return, then he might never return again. Only after quite some time had passed did she rub her own hands, discovering that they were extremely cold. She originally thought that when this time limit passed, she wouldn’t feel anything.\n The darkness continued, a strong feeling of danger was approaching, yet Helen suddenly felt indifferent. Life and death, for her, had always been something she treated with indifference. Meanwhile, for ultra life forms whose lifespans were near limitless, life or death should be the greatest consideration.\n Above the north’s frozen sea, the clouds of radiation were heavier than ever before, the clouds at the center almost touching the ocean surface, forming an incomparably massive sphere. At the center of the clouds, Spider Empress’ body moved, and then she slowly raised her head. Her eyes still carried a bit of perplexity as her giant legs moved about. The soreness that transmitted from every corner of her body made her feel extremely uncomfortable. Her eyes would occasionally become clear, but most of the time, they would only seem even more lost. This originally should have been a period of hibernation for her, for her body to completely absorb the energy it acquired, but her current sleeping process was interrupted by a mysterious threat. This type of feeling did not feel good, as if a fierce tiger who dominated a mountain forest suddenly discovered another one of its kind within its own territory.\n Spider Empress suddenly became clear-headed, feeling shock and fear! However, the price for being clear-headed was suffering, indescribable pain surging from every part of her body. It all gathered towards her head, making her grip her head while howling in pain. Meanwhile, whenever she became clear-headed, the spider body’s convulsions would become clearer, sending even more pain towards the depths of Spider Empress’ consciousness. She could sense that the complete body already covered every part of her spider body, moreover starting to reveal its malevolence. The two parts of the perfect body’s absorption of energy were greatly increased, completely not just additive. Over half of the massive amount of energy she ingested was absorbed by the perfect body, and its conversion of energy was completely 100% without the slightest waste. On the balance of energy, the scale’s center of gravity finally tilted from Lanaxis to the perfect body.\n Lanaxis continuously screamed and struggled, two shocking lines of blood even more so falling from the corners of her eyes, sliding down her soft cheeks, and then flowed down her neck. She was already using everything she had to resist the perfect body, apart from her head, every other part of her body became the most vicious battlefield. The tissues that still belonged to her continuously attacking the perfect body, the two sides mutually devouring each other, struggling over all food and nutrients that they could seize. This wasn’t an unfamiliar battle, when she merged with the first portion of the perfect body, the Spider Empress previously experienced a similar battle, at that time, she actually used her own strength to completely subdue the perfect body’s first attack. However, for the sake of facing the apostles, she resolutely merged with the second portion of the perfect body, but in reality, not even she herself could say how much of this choice was due to her curiosity towards the higher mysteries of life.\n However, not even she expected the power of two parts of the perfect body to be this great when merged together. When the struggles within her body exceeded a certain threshold, the battle situation became irreversible. At that time, there would no longer be a Spider Empress, only the perfect body left.\n Lanaxis was always prideful, her pride far greater than what Bevulas and Josh Morgan, these old friends believed. When she discovered that the battle situation was unfavorable, she suddenly calmed down, reached out a sharp nail, and then cut across her waist, actually wishing to separate the spider body!\n “Wait!” A voice suddenly sounded in her consciousness!\n Lanaxis stopped her hands, coldly replying, ‘perfect body’? She already noticed that this voice came from within her body.\n “Yes.” The perfect body replied. “Using your people’s words… could we have a talk?”\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-40-11","bookId":1500,"book":{"id":1500,"title":"Demon Hunter","description":"---\n Following the nuclear warfare, massacre extended towards the entire world.
