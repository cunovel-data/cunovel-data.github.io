Did you come to destroy us?” Madeline’s ice-cold and indifferent voice sounded. Her beautiful small face carried an undisguised expression of loss.\n “That seems to be my fate.” Su replied. He could already feel the urge within his instincts, just like the urge to take a nap after a meal, the most basic type of instinct. He could only delay it, and could not suppress it.\n Madeline nodded, not saying anything else.\n Su frowned, and then said, “Madeline, leave Valhalla and come to my side. You don’t need to accept the apostles’ fate, they have nothing to do with you.\n The young lady shook her head with a somewhat blank expression, softly saying, “No, that’s not true. We’ve experienced endless time together, and also faced countless battles. The life in this world… is only like a dream. I cannot abandon my past companions.”\n “They aren’t some good people, moreover, they do not belong to this world. We are different from them.” Su was still trying to persuade her.\n The young lady sighed and said, “That is because of the will of the world and this body’s influence. If you do not feel any good impressions towards them, then that truly is an embodiment of the will of this world.”\n Su remained silent for a moment, and only then did he say, “In the end, I still feel that I am human.”\n The young lady’s lips opened, and with a voice that was ever so soft, she said, “I am too…”\n Only, the young lady’s words were impossible for Su to hear. At this time, Valhalla already surged with dazzling radiance, energy surging out. The defensive energy field unfolded from the front, and the closed behind the ship. The eyes of the female portrait at the bow of the warship became completely round, an extremely powerful energy light beam shooting out from her mouth! Valhalla’s main cannon released a full powered attack, combining the three apostles’ energy. Bierlus’ entire body immediately trembled, countless cracks appearing on the surface of its body, energy radiance pouring out like water, and then gathering at its head. Without waiting for Su’s order, Bierlus immediately opened its giant mouth, an incomparably thick deep black energy pillar shooting out from its mouth, facing Valhalla’s main cannon!\n The two streaks of energy beams extended for several dozen kilometers, meeting between the starship and giant beast, immediately producing an extremely complex clash, explosion, and destruction. The crazy energy turned into a several kilometers diameter giant dark energy sphere, endless electrical sparks dancing about outside. Moreover, there were dark colored stripes vaguely appearing within the sphere, signs of space being torn apart. Inside the energy sphere, even the sturdiest alloy would instantly distort and vaporize. Valhalla’s main cannon’s attack seemed endless, while Bierlus was also releasing the destructive energy beam with everything it had, and as such, the energy sphere continuously expanded. Valhalla’s main cannon gathered the power of three apostles, and as a result, Bierlus immediately felt a great pressure shortly afterwards. However, it didn’t have any intention of backing up, still resisting Valhalla’s attacks with full force. The Stupa was different from other biological weapons, even if it was completely destroyed, Su could still revive it in the future, moreover with the present world’s memories. From a certain perspective, destruction was only a type of sleep for the Stupas.\n Su already leapt high into the air. Energy surged around his body, and then he reached out his finger, a fine streak of light firing out from his fingertips, shining on Valhalla’s body! Facing this unremarkable energy streak, the energy barrier covering the starship was instantly penetrated, and then the sturdy ship body quickly melted and broke down. According to this speed, in less than a second, this energy streak would stab straight through Valhalla!\n However, the young lady who had remained still this entire time took a step forward, instantly rushing out a hundred meters, using her body to intercept this light streak and Valhalla! The young lady narrowed her eyes slightly, then raised her left hand, using her forearm to block that black streak of light. The power that could easily blast through the starship instead only left an unremarkable charred trace on the young lady’s fine white arm. Apart from this, there was no other damage.\n This was the Combat Domain twelfth level ability, Absolute Defense. In Madeline’s hands, even though Absolute Defense couldn’t truly block all attacks, it could at the very least make her body’s defenses far surpass Valhalla’s.\n With Madeline blocking the attack, Valhalla’s main cannon’s power immediately increased substantially. Bierlus roared in suffering, the starship’s attacks already approaching the limits of what it could bear, and the power was still continuously increasing. The hundreds of female portraits on the side of Valhala’s body opened their eyes one after another, continuously releasing streaks of energy from their mouths one after another. These energy streaks drew out arcs under the guidance of force fields, continuously blasting the Stupa’s massive body. All of the Stupa’s energy was already used to deal with Valhalla’s main cannon, the energy barrier protecting its own body already extremely frail. Quite a few of the energy beams that were densely packed like rain broke through the barrier, smashing into Bierlus’ body. These energy beams ruthlessly tore through the Stupa’s armor, destroying the tissues within it, producing many bursts of blood on its massive body.\n Su frowned slightly. His body leaned forward, and then he sprinted forward, already reaching an inconceivable speed with just a few steps. He passed through the sword Madeline brandished to intercept him with, instantly arriving on Valhalla, and then entered the ship through one of the female portraits who were just about to fire out energy radiance. That female portrait’s expression instantly distorted, screaming in pain, as if it was a real living creature.\n However, as soon as he rushed into Valhalla, Madeline’s heavy sword flew over from the front again. Su leaned to the side, reaching out his hand to tap the heavy sword, and then passed by the young lady like a streak of lightning, continuing into the depths of the starship. The young lady’s entire body trembled, involuntarily taking a few steps back. Su’s current power and energy were already great to an inconceivable degree, difficult for even Madeline to face. However, her heavy sword flew out again, hacking out with unexpected power, drawing out a bloody scar on Su’s back. No matter when it was, the young lady’s combat skill was always perfect to the point of leaving others in despair.\n Su didn’t mind this small injury at all, he already sensed the locations of the three apostles he targeted. As a result, he completely disregarded the starship’s internal composition, directly rushing at the apostles! Destructive energy was continuously released from the surface of Su’s body, the starship’s composition always instantly destroyed before this energy, and as such, Su forcibly carved out a path through the inside of the ship.\n An identical copy to himself suddenly emerged before his eyes. However, now, Serendela’s duplicated body no longer posed any threat to Su. Su suddenly increased speed, forcefully passing through several of his duplicated bodies. After Su rushed past, those duplicated bodies’ movements immediately became sluggish, and then they slowly fell. When they made contact with the ground, their bodies already became charred black. Just a slight touch was already enough to completely burn their bodies into ashes.\n Madeline pursued him from the back, when she passed them by, she even more so released two sword waves, completely destroying the duplicated bodies that hadn’t completely broken down yet.\n Right now, regardless of whether it was power, speed, or energy intensity, Su could already stably subdue Madeline, but he didn’t seem interested in fighting the young lady at all, instead single-mindedly focusing on the three apostles hidden in the starship’s depths.\n Su suddenly stopped in the air! Right before him, a small black energy sphere was slowly moving over. This energy sphere contained extremely terrifying energy, to the extent where it even made Su’s short hair flutter a bit. This was Serendela’s ultimate attack, enough to threaten Su’s life. Meanwhile, Fitzdurk’s aura appeared right before him, releasing countless powerful electrical arcs. Valhalla was equivalent to Fitzdurk’s body, in the starship, he could release attacks from any angle. Meanwhile, what placed Su on guard the most were the faint force fields tangling about his body. These force fields weren’t extremely powerful, but they were enough to inhibit Su’s movements. In certain situations, just moving slightly slower was fatal, for example, if the three apostles intercepted him from the front, and Madeline cut him off from the rear. This perfectly coordinated attack, was something only Rochester could do. Not every apostle could restrict the seventh apostle’s movements, not even a small amount of restriction.\n Su’s light blonde scattered hair all stood on end, the green light in his pupils flickering with increased frequency, all energy crazily transferred. Being attacked by four apostles at the same time put Su in a seemingly dangerous situation. However, it was only seemingly, Fitzdurk, Serendela, and Rochester were all attacking at full force, while Madeline wasn’t. Even now, the young lady’s attacks were a bit weaker than even the three apostles’, all of her attacks only displayed sixty to seventy percent of her strength. As the so-called apostles’ most powerful Sword, by not releasing all of her power, their combat strength was decreased by not just a single level.\n In an instant, Su already prepared to face Fitzdurk’s electrical radiance head-on, drag Serendela’s energy sphere, and then forcefully break through Rochester’s energy field, meanwhile using his body to take on Madeline’s attack. This was a crazy plan, Su would take on serious injuries as the price to simultaneously heavily injure three apostles, then use his much stronger regeneration abilities to obtain victory. It should be said that as the seventh apostle, Su’s plan completely targeted the apostles’ weak points except for one thing, which was Madeline’s attack. If this was in another time and place, the seventh apostle definitely wouldn’t do this, because even for the seventh apostle, the Sword possessed fatal destructive power.\n However, right now, the seventh apostle was Su, while the Sword was Madeline. They both carried names that reflected the will of this world, and not an interchangeable symbol.\n Everything went as Su planned, the electrical light struck Su’s body, after carrying out a set amount of damage, it was reflected, and then what followed was Fitzdurk’s howl of pain. The energy sphere was deflected until it flew about unpredictably, Serendela’s alarm impossible to disguise. The energy sphere’s energy already didn’t receive control, every second of its existence delivering great damage to her own body. Meanwhile, Rochester was also screaming in pain, the energy field restricting Su was covered in cracks, these cracks still increasing, every crack equivalent to a wound on Rochester’s own body. The Inheritor was close to a pure energy body to begin with, so this type of energy level damage was incredibly severe for him.\n Finally, it was Madeline’s sword.\n Su’s pupils suddenly contracted, turning around with shock! The heavy sword’s edge was like a dragon, tearing through space as it arrived! The sword had strands of black mist around it, something that would only appear after the destructive energy reached a certain degree of power. The young lady’s sword already possessed all of her strength, the power several times greater than her previous attacks, moreover released in one go, not leaving any room for leeway. She was just like the apostles, wishing to do everything they could to end Su’s life!\n Su was stunned, instinctively raising his hand to point at the young lady’s heart. That was the apostle’s core, as well as Madeline’s only weak point. The energy light beam was dark to the point where it could condense into liquid! Before this situation of inevitable death, Su’s instinctive reaction was to deliver an attack guaranteed to kill.\n However, before Su, the young lady’s appearance suddenly changed, becoming that eight year old little girl who was currently walking towards the Spider Empress. The determination, bewilderment, and uneasiness on her face were just like how it was right now. This was a past memory, the most realistic thought from the bottom of Su’s heart, not the apostles using any methods.\n Su released a sigh from deep within him, the hand he raised slowly fell. The three apostles’ spiritual bodies received serious injuries once more, but when they saw the heavy sword enter Su’s chest, Rochester instead revealed an almost unperceivable smile.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-40-16","bookId":1500,"book":{"id":1500,"title":"Demon Hunter","description":"---\n Following the nuclear warfare, massacre extended towards the entire world.
