{"id":49579,"no":940,"title":"Book 6 Chapter 31.6","content":"Book 6 Chapter 31.6 - Unknown\\n\\n The war was going to end?\\n\\n War often started because of an insignificant matter, and it often came to a sudden end.\\n\\n This was especially true in the new era or turmoil. When the fate of the entire world depended on the wills of a few powerful individuals who were above all living things, it became even more so like this.\\n\\n That was why the Blood Parliament’s civil war ended in the span of a single night.\\n\\n All leaders of important powers attached to the chairman’s side were paid a visit by Dyke Avidar that same day, the information they received the exact same: Bevulas was already dead, while the empress was still alive.\\n\\n This was information that was enough to topple everything. In the span of a single night, the Spider Empress Lanaxis’ past methods and achievements were recalled once more by these people who easily forgot about the past, sweat covering all of their bodies soon afterwards.\\n\\n Dyke Avidar didn’t speak much, aside from this piece of information, he didn’t speak a single extra word. Moreover, he would always come abruptly, and then quietly leave. Apart from the pervading darkness that never scattered, there were no traces of his arrival and departure. These powers, regardless of whether they were large families or troops that independently attached themselves, Dyke would always be able to accurately find their leader’s position. Moreover, regardless of what they were doing, he would always appear directly before their faces. The moment the Spreader of Darkness chose to appear wasn’t always suitable either, he would appear at their sides when they were eating, napping, or even showering, and then deliver the aforementioned information in an extremely calm manner.\\n\\n Dyke Avidar was extremely calm, but the ones who received the information definitely couldn’t remain calm, to the extent where occasionally, there were some who displayed extreme actions, for example, cursing out, or even using violence. Their attacks were obviously useless against Dyke Avidar, the Spreader of Darkness was like an intangible dark haze, everything passing right through his body regardless of whether it was bullets or energy attacks. Quite a few household goods and even house walls were smashed apart, yet Dyke Avidar wasn’t injured in the slightest, to the extent where it couldn’t even slow down his words in the slightest. None of those who took action received punishment, but not a single person who spoke rudely had a good ending. The dark haze that spread from Dyke Avidar’s body seemed to possess life, entering their bodies in large amounts. Once the black haze entered their body, it would be as if thousands to tens of thousands of ants made their way into their blood vessels, all those who were infected would collapse onto the ground, begin to howl and scream miserably. Meanwhile, Dyke Avidar would give up on these people, instead find the one with the second-most authority, repeat his words once more, and then leave.\\n\\n When the sky brightened the next day, this piece of information had already spread throughout the Blood Parliament with inconceivable speed. Immediately, when they thought about what they did in the war, many of them began to feel worry. What spread at the same time with this news, was the Spreader of Darkness Dyke Avidar’s name, his past accomplishments also unearthed one after another by some people. As a result, many people immediately broke out in cold sweat, most of them those who had previously attacked the Spreader of Darkness.\\n\\n By noon, news of Waterfront Castle being half destroyed, already in ruins, as well as Bevulas and Lagerfeld’s whereabouts being unknown spread at the speed of light. As a result, the Spider Empress’ giant shadow was instantly cast over the entire Blood Parliament once more, Dyke Avidar who served as the messenger also appearing much more powerful and mysterious.\\n\\n However, as Dyke Avidar moved through the darkness, when he heard these evaluations of fear or adoration towards him, he couldn’t help but sigh with sorrow inwardly. These people obviously didn’t know that the current Dyke Avidar’s past flames of bravery and valiance had long been extinguished. All he wished for now, was to calmly pass the remainder of his life under the shadow of the Spider Empress he could only look up to. For someone like him, this was a tragic ending. However, despite this being the case, the Spreader of Darkness’ height was still not something these so-called great figures could ever hope to reach.\\n\\n From his point of view, in the age of turmoil, aside from the single Spider Empress at the very peak, all other lives were merely lived in tragedy.\\n\\n There was only one destination left in Dyke Avidar’s itinerary.\\n\\n In the list of names the Spider Empress gave him, the various powers or families all had clear targets, only the last one only had a location with no other information. However, whether there was enough information or not wasn’t important. Dyke Avidar’s darkness was ever-present, and it was also the range of his perception, this function similar to the Panoramic View, but this range was much greater than the Panoramic View. Even if it was Su’s Panoramic View, the radius of perception wouldn’t even reach half of Dyke Avidar’s.\\n\\n More than a hundred kilometers of distance, below Dyke Avidar’s feet, was nothing more than half an hour’s matter, and it was just walking speed. Wherever he passed, ordinary people would only feel as if their surroundings darkened slightly, and then everything would return to normal. As Dyke Avidar made his way through a hundred kilometers of wilderness, not a single ordinary person could see him. This was an expanse of wilderness where the flames of war were still burning, with almost no living ordinary humans to be seen, corpses laying everywhere. Soon afterwards, a small town appeared in Dyke Avidar’s field of view.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-31-6","bookId":1500,"book":{"id":1500,"title":"Demon Hunter","description":"---\\n Following the nuclear warfare, massacre extended towards the entire world.
