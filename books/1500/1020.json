Long silver hair spread out, bits of star fragments flying about. When her eyes were still a bit perplexed, this room suddenly shook intensely, the ceiling suddenly caving in. The Spider Empress’ hand already tore through, smashing downwards! The empress’ giant hand already occupied all space in this room, so there was no way to evade at all!\n The young lady’s blue eyes suddenly lit up. She slowly raised her left hand, facing the empress’ middle finger. The Spider Empress’ middle finger was also a giant several meter thick pillar, the degree of hardness even more so exceeding steel. Meanwhile, the young lady was still the size of a human, compared to the empress’ middle finger, she was much smaller than even a mosquito proportionately. However, the young lady raised her left hand just like that, facing the empress’ middle finger, moreover stopping the pressure of the middle finger!\n All of Valhalla trembled greatly because of this!\n The young lady’s figure gradually became clear, still dressed in a dark colored jacket and simple jeans, a pair of flat-bottomed shoes on her feet. This appearance couldn’t be considered fashionable at all in the olden era, yet because of her beautiful and perfect body, she still made this outfit the most suitable decoration. The young lady’s feet stepped firmly on the ground, not budging an inch. Based on normal reasoning, the Spider Empress’ attack could completely penetrate Valhalla, not something the thin layer of ship body the young lady stood on could stop. However, the young lady’s feet didn’t move, the board beneath her feet not caving in the slightest either. It was inconceivable, yet it happened.\n At the same time, Fitzdurk in the central control room released a miserable scream, voice extremely loud, ringing through all of Valhalla! The body he had just condensed suddenly dispersed, a large half almost disappearing. For some reason, he took the full brunt of the Spider Empress’ attack, and because it happened too suddenly, he didn’t protect himself in the slightest, thus leading to him being seriously injured.\n Above the ship body, Serendela was distracted by the empress’ arm that suddenly stopped for an almost undetectable instant, and then she immediately grabbed this rare opportunity to attack frantically. With each millisecond, she would leave several enormous injuries on the empress’ arm!\n The young lady stopped Spider Empress’ arm with a single hand, and then with a wave of her right hand, the black iron fragments everywhere immediately gathered in the air, forming a two-handed giant sword, jumping into the young lady’s hands on its own. The giant sword was eight meters long, forming a stark contrast with her small figure. However, when the young lady brandished it, it was as if she was waving a feather. The giant sword drifted into the air, stabbing fiercely into the empress’ middle finger! An energy storm erupted on the sword’s edge soon afterwards, breaking the empress’ middle finger inch by inch. A storm of flesh and blood immediately poured into Valhalla!\n The Spider Empress’ muffled groan transmitted from outside Valhalla, that hand finally withdrawing. Then, her voice sounded from the opening.\n “Madeline?”\n The young lady was precisely Madeline who froze herself. She didn’t immediately reply to the Spider Empress’ question, instead looking around her, looking at the dumbstruck flesh puppets. Wherever her eyes passed through, a layer of azure color would be applied over the flesh puppets. Then, the skin covering their bodies would break apart layer after layer, separate, and then the flesh puppets’ consciousness would be overwhelmed by irresistible pain. They rolled about, to the extent where they smashed their heads against the wall, yet couldn’t reduce the suffering they felt in the slightest. Meanwhile, at this moment, their connection with Serendela was restored, and as such, the flesh puppets immediately transmitted their pain and pleads to the master who created them. When Serendela felt this attack, the giant sword almost separated from her hands. She erupted into rage, but right when she was about to roar out angrily, she was suddenly stunned, watching as Madeline gradually rose up before her, flying out from Valhalla. The feeling she felt in that instant, was breathtaking.\n “Madeline.” The Spider Empress lowered her head to look at the young lady who was no different from a speck of dust, calling out to her with a rare gentle tone.\n The young lady’s expression was extremely calm, the calmness not deliberate, but rather a coldness that came from her innermost depths, as if she wasn’t concerned with anything. She raised her head to look at the Spider Empress, and only after some time did she say, “I am Madeline, but also the sword of the apostles.”\n “Then we’ve finally become enemies.” Lanaxis said with a smile.\n Madeline nodded in a serious manner, raising her giant sword. Immediately afterwards, she already turned into a shooting star, smashing viciously into the Spider Empress’ incomparably massive body!\n The eight meters giant sword could barely be viewed as a toothpick, but it was precisely this toothpick that brought the Spider Empress greater damage than anything before. The giant sword brandished about with unimaginably great speed, with each movement, it would leave behind giant wounds that were several dozen meters long and ten meters deep, even the spider body no exception. Meanwhile, Madeline’s own speed was even faster than the giant sword’s movements, drawing out layers of afterimages, dancing about the Spider Empress’ body, leaving behind countless injuries all over Lanaxis’ body. When Fitzdurk and Serendela in Valhalla saw this scene, their expressions were all complicated. Apart from certain skills, their normal attacks couldn’t even compare to Madeline’s movement speed. This was to say, if Madeline were to fight them, she would be invincible, unless their special skills were able to deliver a fatal strike onto her, or if they could completely defend against her attacks.\n However, the possibility of either situation happening, was zero.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-38-9","bookId":1500,"book":{"id":1500,"title":"Demon Hunter","description":"---\n Following the nuclear warfare, massacre extended towards the entire world.
