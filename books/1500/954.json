{"id":49593,"no":954,"title":"Book 6 Chapter 32.9","content":"Book 6 Chapter 32.9 - Overture Arnobi was completely unaware of it, but at this very moment, the tens of thousands of mechanical bugs split up into four directions, moving along the great earth. One group headed straight east, rushing towards the great sea. The previously quiet and mysterious Land of Rest, was also flattened by countless high energy light beams, over fifty thousand lives thus turned to ashes. The Holy Crusaders that had previously tangled with the Blood Parliament for several decades, also became history this very day. Tens of thousands of mechanical bugs weren’t impossible to stop, only, almost all of the Holy Crusaders’ most powerful individuals died under Persephone and Su’s hands in the last two years, so it could also be said that it was their very hands that brought about today’s tragedy. The four waves of mechanical bug swarms were like four great undercurrents, moving about the great earth, leaving behind a great scar wherever they passed. Apart from the bug swarm that swept through the Holy Crusaders’ territory remaining pretty much intact, when the other three waves entered deeply into the Blood Parliament’s territory, they were like muddy waters that ran into shoal rocks, breaking apart and scattering. The mechanical bug army that engulfed the Holy Crusaders’ territory turned around and headed south, entering the Blood Parliament’s territory. However, soon after they invaded, just like the previous three waves of bugs, they completely disappeared. The four bug tides’ attacks took tens of thousands of lives. Even though most of them were residents of the Holy Crusaders’ territory, the Blood Parliament also paid the lives of more than ten thousand civilians and several hundred elite soldiers. The mechanical bugs moved at speeds exceeding a hundred kilometers an hour in their offense states, describing this as lightning attacks was completely appropriate. Meanwhile, even though the swarm divided up and attacked the Blood Parliament from completely different directions, they were destroyed at roughly the same time. In the eyes of a few people, quite a few things could be deduced from this. At the edge of the Arthur Family’s territory, O’Brien stood at the top of a small mountain that wasn’t all that tall, his eyes narrowed slightly, gazing into the northwest where the mechanical bug swarm invaded from. On the hillside in front of the small mountain, all types of mechanical bug remains were piled up , forming a semi-circular ring around the small mountain. Behind O’Brien, apart from the inseparable Eileen, there were more than ten individuals with overcast expressions, their bodies filled with killing intent, the Arthur Family’s most elite special forces. Before these dozen or so individuals, were the remains of close to thirty thousand mechanical bugs. This was a sudden, yet not all that difficult of a battle. “These fellas really came fast.” A male said. “Their numbers are quite a bit greater than what we predicted as well.” Another added. The mechanical bugs weren’t that large individually, but when tens of thousands of their remains were piled up together, they covered everything, creating quite the scene. While looking at this doomsday-like scene, Eileen also had a serious expression on her face. “This shouldn’t be their main force, but rather just an investigational attack force, right? However… there are already this many? Then their main force…” O’Brien had a grave look on his face. He muttered to himself, and then said, “Several hundred thousand, or maybe even over a million. Moreover, I have a feeling that even though it sounds inconceivable, the challenge we are facing, might very well be on the scale of tens of millions.” “Ten million?!” Eileen couldn’t help but cry out. “Isn’t that equivalent to a great mountain of supplies?” O’Brien laughed bitterly and said, “For that fella who produced these things, not even turning an entire mountain into mechanical bugs is impossible.” “But…” Eileen didn’t continue with her questions. She really wanted to know what they were supposed to do when they truly faced a mechanical bug swarm on the scale of tens of millions. The rational choice was to immediately run, abandon the ancient castle that had been passed down for several centuries and base that took more than ten years to build. However, when they faced Bevulas’ overwhelming army, wasn’t it precisely the conviction to protect the family’s ancient castle that miraculously supported O’Brien through situations of death again and again? Then this time, would he give up the family’s ancient castle that carried irreplaceable historical meaning? This question still didn’t need an answer right now. However, when it needed to be answered, she feared that there might not be a choice. While facing the wind, charred smell wafted all around her, Eileen smelled a hint of doomsday. She gently leaned her head against O’Brien’s back, muttering, “If we really have to die together, then that’s not that bad either…” “What?” O’Brien was currently distracted, not hearing what Eileen said. “It’s nothing.” Eileen only smiled, not planning to continue that thought.
