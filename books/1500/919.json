He laid there on his back, his black clothes already completely torn, revealing his wound covered body. There was a terrifying injury in front of his chest, from the looks of it an old injury, but it was torn apart before it completely healed. The giant fifty centimeter long injury almost completely tore his chest apart, revealing his heart that was still squirming about within. Just like all high level ability users, O’Brien’s internal composition was already somewhat different from that of traditional humans, only mutated inner organs able to support the tremendous energy exhaustion and supply abilities needed. However, just from this injury alone, one could see that not only were there mutated changes, many traces were clearly injuries, to the extent where quite a few of them were new. He laid there on the ground, looking at the still fiery red clouds in the night sky, breathing heavily. As his chest rose and fell, countless injuries, especially the giant wound at the center, began to open and close, releasing blood. The injuries on his inner organs began to rupture as well, while many of the injuries that had been repeatedly torn and closed, due to not receiving immediate treatment, even started to show signs of rotting. The sounds of explosions on the battlefield gradually weakened. This battle already ended, once again ending with O’Brien’s victory, and the chairman’s side’s losses were severe. When he thought of this, a faint smile appeared on O’Brien’s face. Under the curtain of night, Eileen quietly appeared. She knelt down at O’Brien’s side, her hands gently caressing the injuries covering his body. Her hand was no longer pure white and exquisite, but rather covered in black and brown colors. There were rough, fine cuts covering its surface, only her motions as gentle as before. It wasn’t just her hands, her body, face, and skin were all no longer fine white and soft, only her eyes just as beautiful as before. Her movements were fast and gentle, soothing O’Brien’s injuries, removing the rotting flesh chunks and tissues, and then using her own energy to stimulate the tissues around the injuries, urging them to grow and staunch. Her head was slightly drooped, not allowing others to see her expression, but her hands were trembling slightly. O’Brien released a light sigh. “This fella has become even more treacherous than before, self-detonation! Hmph, I truly never expected it to use something like this. However, it’s not that big of a deal, it only proves that its evolution has reached a bottleneck, unable to defeat me in a frontal battle, only able to use this type of method. This is a good thing, isn’t it?” Eileen released a deep sigh, finally placing her hands over the injury in front of his chest. She cleaned the injury while saying somewhat absent-mindedly, “Indeed, it’s a good thing. However, he really was a troublesome fella. You’ll have to endure a bit of pain, the injuries this time are quite serious, it seems like I need to use a bit more time.” While speaking, she clenched her teeth, and then stuck her hand into O’Brien’s chest. O’Brien quietly clenched his fist, his body not moving, but the twitching of the muscle tissue that was exposed gave away how much pain he was enduring. He sensed Eileen’s nervousness, and as a result asked, “What kind of person is Gardner?” “Gardner?” Eileen stared blankly for a moment, and then began to try to recall information on him. “He wasn’t anyone important before, merely Dr. Connor’s assistant. I had met him once before, he wasn’t all that smart, his looks also vulgar, not leaving me with that great of an impression before. I don’t know why the chairman would suddenly put him in such an important position, nor do I know where his monstrous abilities came from. Perhaps it’s one of the laboratory’s secret projects. In the past, I wasn’t all that interested in these things, and I spent most days out of the year asleep, which is why I don’t understand these inner details too well. Back then, the only feeling I got from him was that this person might go crazy.” While speaking, perhaps because she was somewhat distracted, Eileen’s taut body finally loosened up. When he saw this scene, O’Brien laughed, but his brows then furrowed from the sudden intense pain. He released another breath of air, released a sigh, and then said, “Gardner is indeed a madman. Those who are crazy are the hardest to deal with. If it wasn’t because he finally reached his evolutionary bottleneck, I really don’t know how much longer I could persist for.” “But this battle almost took your life!” O’Brien smiled, saying, “I’ve already almost lost my life more than once now. Don’t worry, my luck is quite good, I won’t die that easily. Also, in the future, it would only get better and better, isn’t that so?” Eileen suddenly flipped out. “Why do you have to take on such a great burden alone? The Arthur Family isn’t made up of you alone, so why are you shouldering the entire war? Isn’t there Persephone as well? We’ll definitely be able to find her! If it is only you by yourself, can you win this war?!” “Isn’t the war almost won already?” O’Brien said with a smile. “But…” Eileen was at a loss for words. This war that seemed to be one of despair, precisely because of the man before her fighting one battle after another, seizing small victories one after the next, had its impossible situation quietly reversed. However, she also felt like what O’Brien said was incorrect. For the sake of achieving this miraculous victory, how much did he himself pay? Perhaps the only one who knew these things was herself who had fought by his side from start until now. O’Brien didn’t directly respond to her questions, instead raising his hand with difficulty, lightly patting Eileen and saying, “Let alone the fact I am not fighting entirely alone, there is still you. If I didn’t have you, I definitely would have no chance of winning over Bevulas.” Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-29-3","bookId":1500,"book":{"id":1500,"title":"Demon Hunter","description":"--- Following the nuclear warfare, massacre extended towards the entire world.
