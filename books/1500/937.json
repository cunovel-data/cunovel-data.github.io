She softly and quietly closed the office door, the sound of high-heeled shoes moving along the corridor. Morgan suddenly realized that she would pour away this cup of cold coffee, and then exchange it for a brand new cup. In the past, this wasn’t a big deal, but right now, when there was a shortage of everything, it became a hundred percent a luxury. This was completely inconsistent with what he was used to. However, after thinking about it, he still didn’t stop the secretary. This was partly because coffee was one of his few pleasures in this life, and partly because the young secretary needed this to prove the worth of her existence. Otherwise, she would become just like the abandoned Black Dragonriders, spending each day in anxiety.\n “I’ve really grown old!” Josh Morgan sighed. Only old people thought about so many inconsequential matters.\n An ocean breeze poured in through the half open window, the strong damp and cold air making even Morgan feel a bit unwell. There was still a fire burning in the fireplace, but it couldn’t disperse this type of coldness at all. In fact, with Morgan’s ability, forget about this degree of coldness, even if it was a negative hundred degrees extreme cold, he could still resist it. As for why he felt cold, it could only mean that his heart was currently gloomy and overcast.\n “Winter is almost here again. This war should end soon as well, right?” Josh Morgan said this to himself, but also as if he was saying it for someone else to hear.\n A shadow at the corner of the office suddenly moved, a large amount of darkness spreading, making the dim wall lamp’s radiance completely withdraw into a corner. Dyke Avidar walked out from the darkness, still dressed as a high class butler. He walked with a calm and unhurried gait, arriving before General Morgan.\n Josh Morgan gave the Spreader of Darkness a look, and then laughed, saying, “After all these years of seeing you in your current attire, I still find it rather hard to get used to, this feeling even stronger now. It now feels like those past years seem to be a bit more deserving of reminiscence.”\n Dyke Avidar said, “After all these years passed, we still never met that many times, so it isn’t strange for you to feel unaccustomed. However, I see it day in and out, so I’m already completely used to it. Haha, reminiscing about the past is a sign of aging!”\n “Haven’t we all grown old already?” Josh Morgan said.\n “No, me and you have grown old, but Her Majesty the Empress is still the same as in the past.” Dyke Avidar corrected.\n A strange expression flashed past Josh Morgan’s face. “Lanaxis… this means that she has already successfully fused with the perfect body?”\n “Her Majesty the Empress’ matters, I am not clear about.” Dyke Avidar’s reply was watertight.\n Josh Morgan stood there blankly for a moment, and only then did he release a heavy sigh. “Alright, what does she wish to accomplish by sending you here?”\n “Bevulas has already died. The empress’ intention is that the farce ought to come to an end.” Dyke Avidar said.\n Compared to Lanaxis’ evaluation of this civil war that has involved all of the major powers, the first piece of information clearly left Josh Morgan far more shocked. “Bevulas… already died?! How did he die? Could it be that he fought against Lanaxis?”\n Dyke Avidar shook his head and said, “It wasn’t the empress. Mister Bevulas already died before reaching Dark Red Castle. His cause of death, is that when merging with the perfect body, he simultaneously took a genetic collapse formulation.”\n General Morgan’s expression of shock became even more clear. “If it isn’t Lanaxis, then who could it be? Who could force Bevulas to use his complete body? What is Westwood doing?”\n Dyke Avidar laughed bitterly and said, “If my suspicions aren’t mistaken, he should have already died in battle.\n Josh Morgan remained silent for a moment, and then slowly said, “Of our old friends, there aren’t many left. Those with their own way of thinking never live long, only people like me and you who no longer have any interest in forging ahead can continue living. Alright, I already understand Lanaxis’ intentions.”\n Dyke Avidar nodded. He didn’t say anything else, instead turning into a clump of black mist, and then quietly leaving.\n Josh Morgan gazed into the endless sea outside the window, unknown what he was thinking. Only, the wrinkles on his face seemed to have become deeper. The office gradually dimmed, not because of the darkness released by Dyke Avidar, but rather because the sky already became dark.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-31-3","bookId":1500,"book":{"id":1500,"title":"Demon Hunter","description":"---\n Following the nuclear warfare, massacre extended towards the entire world.
